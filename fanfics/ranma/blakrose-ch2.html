<h1>Black Rose, Blue Thunder (part 2 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/blakrose-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>	A low wind blew through the air, ruffling the thick 
brown bangs of Hibiki Ryoga as he studied his surroundings. 
Scratching his forehead under the bandanna he wore Ryoga 
sighed and said, &quot;We finally made it.&quot;
	&quot;Yes,&quot; began the deep voice of his best friend and 
traveling companion, Kuno Tatewaki. &quot;Hopefully their trail 
hasn&#39;t gone dead.&quot;
	&quot;We should be okay,&quot; reassured Ryoga. &quot;We were only 
in that harem for a couple of days.&quot;
	Tatewaki was about to reply when he sneezed abruptly. 
Blinking at this reaction Ryoga said, &quot;You getting a cold?&quot;
	&quot;I should hope not,&quot; said Tatewaki as he rubbed his nose. 
His tawny eyes lit up as they came to the end of the path to stand 
before the cursed training grounds of Jusenkyo. &quot;When the 
Musk captured us I thought that we might never return here to 
gather the proper clues.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ryoga. Following Tatewaki towards 
Jusenkyo&#39;s training grounds he continued, &quot;We almost had all 
the information about Kodachi and those guys she&#39;s traveling 
with when the Musk jumped us. Good thing I had the idea to 
tunnel out of there or we&#39;d still be stuck in that harem.&quot;
	Forming a frown Tatewaki repeated harshly, &quot;Guys.&quot; He 
formed a face of fury then he suddenly calmed and gave a 
cough. &quot;Indeed. That was their description. And for these &#39;guys&#39; 
sakes they best treat my sister as every inch the lady she is. Lest 
a terrible fate befall them...&quot; Tatewaki trailed off in dark tones 
that caused Ryoga to look at him nervously.
	It was like this every time Tatewaki discovered news 
about his sister that didn&#39;t please him. The pair were trying to 
track down Kodachi, whom Tatewaki had been separated from 
when they were placed in different foster homes as children. 
And Ryoga, who had known Tatewaki ever since middle school, 
faithfully followed the path of his oldest and closest friend.
	After all, with his horrible sense of direction Tatewaki 
was the best bet on helping Ryoga to find his father and brother. 
Hoping to distract Tatewaki from his current foul mood, Ryoga 
averted his brown eyes to take in the scenery and comment on it. 
Tatewaki had always enjoyed discussing nature and Ryoga 
knew it would put him in a good mood to dwell on the beauty 
surrounding them. But as he did this, Ryoga&#39;s eyes focused on 
two swift figures in the midst of a battle on top of the high 
bamboo poles located in middle of the Jusenkyo springs.
	&quot;Hey,&quot; said Ryoga as he observed this. He moved his 
hand to shade his eyes and continued, &quot;I think those might be 
some of the local Amazons.&quot;
	&quot;Eh?&quot; questioned Tatewaki as he snapped out of his 
somber musings on his sister&#39;s condition. Following Ryoga&#39;s 
gaze, he narrowed his eyes as he looked upon the fighters. &quot;One 
is a low creature that much is for certain. He&#39;s attacking a girl. 
Well,&quot; Tatewaki pronounced as he took off his heavy backpack 
and dropped it to the ground. &quot;I&#39;ll teach him a lesson about using 
such rude behavior.&quot;
	&quot;But Tachi...&quot; Ryoga protested as his friend took off like 
a shot, bounding into the air and landing on top one of the 
bamboo poles as he challenged the male Amazon. Ryoga 
watched this action and murmured, &quot;I think this might be one of 
those Amazon challenge matches that I&#39;ve heard about.&quot;
	&quot;No customers!&quot; a shrill voice called out and suddenly 
Ryoga found a husky man standing at his side. &quot;Is no good to do 
fighting there! Very bad you should fall in springs!&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Hey,&gt;&quot; said Ryoga in perfect Mandarin as he tapped 
the man&#39;s shoulder who turned his attention to the lost boy. 
&quot;&lt;Mind telling me the exact reason why falling in those springs 
is so bad?&gt;&quot;
	His eyes wide at discovering a foreigner who could 
actually speak his language well, the Jusenkyo Guide 
immediately began explaining the reason at a rapid pace.

	&quot;&lt;Scoundrel!&gt;&quot; shouted Tatewaki in fluent Mandarin. 
He landed with perfect balance on the top of the high bamboo 
pole and unsheathed his family katana then pointed it at the 
Amazon boy with long raven black hair and thick glasses. 
&quot;&lt;What sort of man attacks a lady?&gt;&quot; asked Tatewaki in disgust. 
&quot;&lt;If you feel the need to test your skill in battle then test it 
against me.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;How dare you,&gt;&quot; seethed the Amazon boy. &quot;&lt;Interrupt 
a sacred challenge duel between Xian-pu and myself 
outlander!&gt;&quot;
	Suddenly, the Amazon boy extended his arms and a 
barrage of chains flew at a surprised Tatewaki who winced as 
they wrapped around his midsection, trapping his arms at his 
sides. Straining against their hold Tatewaki hissed, &quot;&lt;I 
compliment your skill but it&#39;s hardly enough to restrain Kuno 
Tatewaki. Not after years of training.&gt;&quot;
	A powerful blue aura rose off the kendoist and the chains 
seemed to melt and stretch outwards. He flexed the muscles in 
both his arms and chest which caused the chains to immediately 
snap. Breathing heavily, Tatewaki shifted his weight to stand on 
his left leg alone. Wearing a small smile he said, &quot;&lt;A 
commendable effort but I&#39;m afraid it wasn&#39;t nearly good 
enough.&gt;&quot;
	Snarling at this the Amazon boy said, &quot;&lt;Very well. I see 
that I&#39;ll have to use all my power. I can&#39;t allow anyone to 
interfere in my quest to win Xian-pu&#39;s hand!&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Mu-tsu,&gt;&quot; a chilling voice entered the air and both 
boys turned their attention to the beautiful Amazon girl with 
long lavender hair and striking scarlet eyes. &quot;&lt;I&#39;ll never marry 
you. All I want is for you to leave me alone. That&#39;s why we&#39;re 
fighting now. You leave the stranger out of it.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Leave him out of it?&gt;&quot; questioned Mousse as he 
chuckled softly. &quot;&lt;He dared to meddle with me finally being 
able to win you as my own! I must defeat this stranger and then 
I&#39;ll defeat you in battle Xian-pu! Rest assured, you will belong to 
me and no other.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Malevolent toad,&gt;&quot; Tatewaki hissed, slashing his 
katana through the air to direct it at Mousse. &quot;&lt;What right do 
you have to claim another&#39;s life as your own to command? She 
is a person of free will and spirit, not a toy at your disposal!&gt;&quot; In 
a fit of rage he flew at the Amazon boy who was barely able to 
dodge Tatewaki&#39;s downward thrust of his katana.
	Giving a wince as he jumped to another bamboo pole 
Mousse looked down at his tattered shirt then lifted his head and 
said, &quot;&lt;You&#39;ll pay for that...&gt;&quot;
	&quot;Tachi!&quot; shouted the panicked voice of Ryoga as he 
interrupted whatever Mousse was going to say next.
	Turning his attention to his friend, Tatewaki blinked then 
said in his native Japanese, &quot;What is it Ryoga-kun? You realize 
this is a bad time for a discussion.&quot;
	Ryoga looked like he was about to say more when his 
expression changed to one of alarm as he shouted, &quot;Tachi! 
Behind you! Watch out!!&quot;
	His tawny eyes shifted their focus and Tatewaki had only 
a second to see the cannonball before it connected with the side 
of his face. Stumbling from the force of impact he lost his 
balance and fell into the cursed spring below.
	Ryoga&#39;s face turned to one of fury as a dark energy 
began to rise around him. In a swift movement he launched 
himself at Mousse who easily dodged Ryoga&#39;s attack that was 
clumsy in his rage. In a casual movement Mousse wrapped 
Ryoga up in several heavy chains which caused the lost boy to 
topple to the ground only inches from a cursed spring. It was 
only by a stroke of luck that he didn&#39;t fall in.
	Chuckling softly Mousse said, &quot;&lt;Be careful outlander or 
you&#39;ll end up like your friend.&gt;&quot;
	Growling at this Ryoga began to break out of the chains 
when the sound of splashing caught his attention and he fixed 
his gaze on the cursed form of Tatewaki who was struggling to 
climb out of the spring. Snapping his chains Ryoga dashed over 
to his friend who was being carefully removed from the spring 
by the Jusenkyo Guide.
	&quot;&lt;That&#39;s right,&gt;&quot; Mousse sneered. &quot;&lt;Take care of the 
fool. I have more important matters to attend to than cursing you 
as well.&gt;&quot; Turning back to Shampoo he said, &quot;&lt;Now it&#39;s your 
turn to be defeated Xian-pu.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;You cursed an innocent man out of spite?&gt;&quot; Shampoo 
said in horror. &quot;&lt;How could you?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Very easily,&gt;&quot; Mousse replied, summoning a variety 
of weapons into his hold. &quot;&lt;He tried to keep me from claiming 
you as my own and that is something I can never allow. He 
deserved it.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Deserved it?&gt;&quot; questioned Shampoo in disbelief. 
Shaking her lavender head she hissed, &quot;&lt;You&#39;re sick and it&#39;s 
time that I stopped your sickness.&gt;&quot;
	Blinking in confusion Mousse said, &quot;&lt;What do--&gt;&quot;
	Mousse didn&#39;t get the chance to finish the rest of his 
statement as Shampoo leapt towards him. In a moment of pure 
precision she knocked him off the bamboo pole causing him to 
fall into one of the cursed springs below.
	&quot;&lt;I have won the challenge that you set before me,&gt;&quot; 
said Shampoo coolly as Mousse resurfaced. &quot;&lt;And I have also 
repaid your treachery against the outlander. Every time that you 
look at yourself in that form I pray that you will remember that I 
was the one who gave it to you. I gave it to you in hopes that 
with it you&#39;ll listen and finally realize that I want nothing to do 
with you.&gt;&quot; Jerking her gaze away from Mousse she finished in 
chilling tones, &quot;&lt;I never want to see your face again Mu-tsu. 
Any affection that I might have had towards you has turned into 
hate because of your relentless pursuit of me. In my heart you 
are forever banished.&gt;&quot;
	Leaping down from the high bamboo pole she stood on 
Shampoo strode towards the Jusenkyo Guide who was standing 
next to the hunched figure of the other outlander boy who held a 
small hidden figure that Shampoo assumed was the one called 
Tatewaki who had foolishly tried to help her against Mousse.
	Still sitting in the depths of the Jusenkyo spring the 
Amazon known as Mousse trembled as he tried to mentally cope 
with what had happened to him. Or to be anatomically correct... 
what had happened to her. Still shaking Mousse could not see 
her new form without the help of her thick prescription lenses. 
But all it took was running her fingers up the length of her chest 
and feeling a noticeable swell there to know what had become of 
her.
	How fitting. In her defeat of him Shampoo had literally 
taken away his manhood and all his rights to claim her by doing 
so. A wrenched sob escaping her lips Mousse blindly fled from 
the springs of sorrow to run in desperation into the depths of the 
nearby woods. Taking with her the harsh final words of 
Shampoo endlessly echoing in her ears.
	&quot;&lt;In my heart you are forever banished.&gt;&quot;

	Kneeling next to the other outlander boy Shampoo gazed 
at the creature sitting in his hands and said, &quot;&lt;He&#39;s turned into a 
chicken.&gt;&quot; She paused to study the beady eyes of the fat yellow 
bird and added, &quot;&lt;A really ugly chicken.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;He&#39;s a phoenix,&gt;&quot; the Guide corrected.
	&quot;&lt;If he&#39;s a phoenix then why does he look like an ugly 
chicken?&gt;&quot; asked Shampoo with a snicker.
	&quot;&lt;Because that&#39;s how the phoenix that drowned in this 
spring looks,&gt;&quot; said the Guide a bit irately. &quot;&lt;Trust me when I 
say this is the legendary phoenix of old. If he sits on a person&#39;s 
head, they will gain unbelievable powers--&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Who cares about that!&gt;&quot; shouted Ryoga. &quot;&lt;Is there 
some way to reverse this?!&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Oh yes Sir!&gt;&quot; said the Guide quickly. &quot;&lt;Your friend 
isn&#39;t trapped like that. He can change back into his normal--&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;How?!&gt;&quot; demanded Ryoga as he let go of Tatewaki 
phoenix who plopped on the ground like a lump then gave an 
loud squawk of displeasure. &quot;&lt;What do we need to do?! I&#39;ll do 
anything!&gt;&quot;
	Pushing Ryoga&#39;s hands from their grip of his shirt the 
Guide produced a steaming tea kettle from out of nowhere and 
said, &quot;&lt;It&#39;s very simple. Cold water will change your friend into 
his cursed form while hot water in turn reverses the affect. 
Observe,&gt;&quot; said the Guide as he poured some of the hot water 
inside of the tea kettle onto Tatewaki phoenix. Instantly the bird 
morphed back into the handsome young man that he&#39;d 
previously been. Except now he was naked.
	Turning beet red on seeing Shampoo&#39;s interested 
inspection of his body Tatewaki quickly grabbed his nearby 
backpack to cover his most private of areas. &quot;&lt;Maiden!&gt;&quot; he 
exclaimed. &quot;&lt;It&#39;s not proper for you to see such things until your 
wedding night! Please close your eyes so I may get dressed 
again.&gt;&quot;
	Forming an amused smile Shampoo obeyed his wishes 
and closed her scarlet eyes as Tatewaki gave a sigh of relief. 
Quickly digging through his backpack he retrieved a pair of 
worn black jeans and a dusty blue shirt.
	Once he was fully dressed Tatewaki coughed and said, 
&quot;&lt;You can open your eyes now maiden.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;My name is Xian-pu,&gt;&quot; said Shampoo in offering. 
&quot;&lt;And yours is Tatewaki, I take it?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Yes,&gt;&quot; replied Tatewaki solemnly. Gesturing towards 
Ryoga he said, &quot;&lt;And this is my friend and boon traveling 
companion Hibiki Ryoga.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Hey,&gt;&quot; said Ryoga nervously. Averting his gaze from 
Shampoo he looked to the Jusenkyo Guide. &quot;&lt;You&#39;re saying that 
every time Tachi gets splashed with cold water he&#39;ll change into 
a phoenix and only hot water can make him human again?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Exactly,&gt;&quot; the Guide said, nodding his head. &quot;&lt;Your 
friend fell into the spring of drowned phoenix. It&#39;s the result of 
the tragic fate of a phoenix that drowned there over four hundred 
years ago. Now every time cold water touches him he will 
transform into the same magical phoenix that drowned in the 
spring.&gt;&quot;
	After pondering this for a moment, Tatewaki finally 
asked, &quot;&lt;Is there a cure available?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;No,&gt;&quot; said the Guide sadly. &quot;&lt;I&#39;m afraid there isn&#39;t Sir. 
No one has yet to find a way to undo the horrible affects of the 
springs of sorrow. The best we can do is maintain the society to 
warn visitors about the terrors of coming here. But sometimes 
even that does not work... like today.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; growled Ryoga in Japanese as he rose to his 
feet. &quot;I&#39;m going to get that guy! He&#39;s going to pay for doing this 
to you!&quot;
	&quot;No,&quot; said Tatewaki in calm Japanese as he also rose to 
his feet. Clasping Ryoga&#39;s shoulder he continued, &quot;I believe the 
one called Mousse was not entirely sane when he attacked me. 
We best not waste time pursuing a madman. Such things are a 
waste of time as proven in our dealings with the Musk. And 
there are more important tasks at hand. We must find the current 
whereabouts of my sister and your wandering family.&quot;
	Tatewaki turned to Shampoo and said in Mandarin, 
&quot;&lt;Xian- pu. I offer my humble apologies for interrupting your 
duel. I did not know it was a battle of honor or I would have 
never interfered. Please forgive my intrusion. Rest assured that 
from now on I shall treat you as the warrior that you truly are. 
My actions were never meant as an insult to your abilities as a 
warrior and I hope that you did not take them as such. I was 
simply ignorant as to your position as an Amazon warrior.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;I understand,&gt;&quot; said Shampoo slowly. &quot;&lt;But why 
have you come to this region? We don&#39;t get that many visitors 
and the ones that we do...&gt;&quot; Shampoo trailed off as a scowl 
graced her pretty features.
	Both the boys looked nervous at this reaction and 
Tatewaki replied, &quot;&lt;My sister Kodachi and I were separated 
many years ago when were but small children. Since reaching 
maturity I have made it my personal quest to find her so we 
might rebuild our lost lives together. While Ryoga-kun is in turn 
searching for his own family, whom he was separated from 
during their endless training journey to improve their skills in 
the art.&gt;&quot; He paused to retrieve his backpack and while he 
searched through it he said, &quot;&lt;We recently received information 
that Kodachi was seen going in this direction.&gt;&quot; Tatewaki rose 
to his feet and handed a tattered photograph over to Shampoo 
very gently. &quot;&lt;By any chance have you seen a girl matching 
these features?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;The demon thief!&gt;&quot; Shampoo exclaimed as her scarlet 
eyes widened. Looking up at Tatewaki with a stricken 
expression she questioned, &quot;&lt;This girl is truly your sister?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Yes,&gt;&quot; said Tatewaki as he carefully removed the 
photograph from Shampoo&#39;s tight grip. Tucking it away in the 
inside pocket to his shirt he questioned, &quot;&lt;But why did you refer 
to her as &#39;demon thief&#39;? My sister&#39;s given name is Kuno Kodachi, 
though I have heard that she has recently taken to calling herself 
the black rose.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;You must come with me Tatewaki,&gt;&quot; Shampoo said 
solemnly. &quot;&lt;That picture and your relationship to the girl in it 
makes you a part of Amazon affairs that are far more important 
than my battle with Mu-tsu.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Oh?&gt;&quot; asked Tatewaki puzzled. &quot;&lt;And what specific 
affairs might those be?&gt;&quot;
	Turning on her heel to head back to her village at a 
steady pace Shampoo replied in steely tones, &quot;&lt;The mission of 
my Cousin and our tribal Enforcer Pur-fum to track down the 
pair of demon thieves who only a month ago stole many of 
tribe&#39;s most valuable treasures.&gt;&quot; Shampoo paused in her walk 
to look at Tatewaki with a sad expression. &quot;&lt;I&#39;m sorry...&gt;&quot; she 
said softly. &quot;&lt;But your sister and her friend have been marked 
for death.&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;Death?&gt;&quot; Tatewaki repeated blankly as he followed 
Shampoo into the outskirts of the village and up a winding path. 
&quot;&lt;Why would my sister be marked in such a way?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;She is one half of the pair of demon thieves who 
invaded our village and made off with several of our most 
valuable treasures,&gt;&quot; informed Shampoo stiffly. &quot;&lt;We do not 
take such actions lightly. It is a blatant insult to our tribe.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;My sister did steal from your village?&gt;&quot; asked 
Tatewaki in stunned disbelief.
	Shampoo directed sympathetic scarlet eyes his way and 
murmured, &quot;&lt;I&#39;m sorry Tatewaki but it&#39;s true. I could never 
forget the face of the girl who was responsible for one of the 
greatest moments of shame our village has ever had.&gt;&quot;
	The lost boy cast a worried look at his best friend, who 
wore a tortured expression after hearing Shampoo&#39;s words. 
&quot;&lt;Xian-pu,&gt;&quot; Ryoga began slowly. &quot;&lt;May I ask where you are 
taking us?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Certainly,&gt;&quot; replied Shampoo politely as she too gave 
Tatewaki a look of concern. &quot;&lt;I am taking you to my Great 
Grandmother, who is the Matriarch of our tribe. She will know 
what to do about Tatewaki&#39;s sister.&gt;&quot;
	Immediately Tatewaki lifted his head and he asked, 
&quot;&lt;You mean that there is a way that I can stop my sister from 
being killed?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Yes,&gt;&quot; Shampoo sighed. &quot;&lt;And you have already 
done it. The interference you presented in my duel with Mu-tsu 
could be interpreted two ways. The first is that it is a clear and 
blatant insult to my skill as a tribal warrior. If I believed that, 
then I would be forced to challenge you to a duel of death in 
order to prove my worth.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;I see...&gt;&quot; said Tatewaki nervously. Swallowing the 
lump in his throat, he asked, &quot;&lt;And the other?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;It could be seen as an honorable offering of friendship 
and loyalty to the tribe,&gt;&quot; said Shampoo. She paused and 
formed a wry smile. &quot;&lt;I have chosen to take your actions as the 
latter instead of the former. You meant no real harm when you 
interrupted my duel. But,&gt;&quot; she added as a dangerous spark lit in 
her scarlet eyes. &quot;&lt;Let it be known that I don&#39;t appreciate having 
my duels fought for me.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Of course!&gt;&quot; exclaimed Tatewaki quickly. &quot;&lt;I&#39;ll never 
make that mistake again!&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Good,&gt;&quot; said Shampoo solemnly. She then began 
heading up the path again.
	Watching her backside with a slight flush tingeing his 
cheeks Tatewaki moved into a brisk pace so he could walk at 
Shampoo&#39;s side. &quot;&lt;Will you help me to prevent my sister&#39;s 
sentence from taking place?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;It depends,&gt;&quot; Shampoo said after a long pause. &quot;&lt;On 
what my Great Grandmother decrees.&gt;&quot;
	She ducked under a low hanging branch, then stopped 
suddenly. Behind her Tatewaki barely managed to not slam into 
her backside. He tilted his dark brown head to one side and 
looked at the figure of a small wrinkled woman clinging to a 
staff. On seeing her Tatewaki twitched as he wondered how it 
was possible that she was related to Shampoo. He looked at the 
curvaceous Amazon and wondered if she was going to look like 
that when she was older. At this thought he grimaced and tried 
to block the disturbing visual that came to mind.
	Quickly regaining his composure Tatewaki coughed and 
said, &quot;&lt;Honored Elder. I am Kuno Tatewaki and I have come 
here to seek your aid.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Is that so?&gt;&quot; the Matriarch replied. She raised an  
eyebrow in speculation and moved her gaze to Shampoo. The 
lavender haired Amazon looked thoroughly uncomfortable 
while she shifted from foot to foot. &quot;&lt;Come,&gt;&quot; pronounced the 
Matriarch as she formed the smallest of smiles. &quot;&lt;There is much 
to discuss.&gt;&quot;

	Hot tears streaming down her cheeks, Mousse tore her 
way through the scraping branches of the thick forest before she 
collapsed to her knees in front of the small stream she had found 
when she was just a small child. It was her special place. Where 
she would come when she wanted to be alone and contemplate 
things. Someday she had hoped to share it with Shampoo, but 
that would never be. Shampoo hated her. Mousse finally 
understood that now. At this thought she released a keening wail 
and buried her face in her arms then began to cry even harder.
	When her sobs ceased she slowly crawled forward to 
gaze at her image as it was reflected in the stream. Blinking 
away her tears Mousse dimly realized for the first time that her 
new form had perfect vision. Bending over she looked more 
carefully at her reflection and was surprised to see the figure of 
beautiful girl gazing back at her. She had long raven hair and 
wide teal eyes that stared at her reflection in certain amazement. 
Touching the surface of the water lightly Mousse said, &quot;&lt;I&#39;m 
pretty.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Xian-pu changed me into a pretty girl,&gt;&quot; breathed 
Mousse. &quot;&lt;I was an ugly man but I&#39;m pretty as a girl. But 
why...?&gt;&quot; She paused to close her eyes as she pondered. A 
minute later she opened them and said, &quot;&lt;I was a horrible as a 
man. But as a girl I can start my life over... I can be a new 
person. A better person. That was why she did this. To help me 
be something better.&gt;&quot; Mousse rose to her feet and clenched her 
hands at her sides. &quot;&lt;So be it,&gt;&quot; she said with eerie calmness. 
&quot;&lt;From this day on Mu-tsu the man no longer exists. I shall live 
my life as a girl.&gt;&quot;
	Mousse sharply turned on her heel and carefully made 
her way back into the forest as she said, &quot;&lt;I&#39;ve learned my 
lesson, Xian-pu. I will no longer pursue you. Instead, I am 
dedicating my life to becoming a better person. I will do this and 
make sure that none ever try to take your happiness from you 
again. I, Mu-tsu, swear it!&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;I am Kho-lon,&gt;&quot; said the Matriarch as she sat in front 
of the gathered group. &quot;&lt;Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku 
Amazons. Now,&gt;&quot; Cologne said with slow intrigue. &quot;&lt;Tell me 
your tale.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Kho-lon,&gt;&quot; said Tatewaki solemnly. &quot;&lt;I came to your 
province in hopes of locating my missing sister, whom I have 
not seen since we were children. I came upon your Great 
Granddaughter, Xian-pu, battling the one called Mu-tsu. I was 
unaware that it was a duel of honor and interfered on her behalf. 
During this battle I became cursed by the magics of Jusenkyo, a 
fate that Mu-tsu also shares. Xian-pu brought me to you because 
your tribe has had contact with my sister.&gt;&quot; Tatewaki paused to 
pull the tattered picture out of his shirt pocket and hand it to 
Cologne. &quot;&lt;I believe that you call her as the &#39;demon thief&#39; but 
her given name is Kuno Kodachi.&gt;&quot;
	Cologne took the picture from Tatewaki and her eyes 
widened slightly. &quot;&lt;Well,&gt;&quot; she began slowly. &quot;&lt;This is an 
interesting turn of events. You say that this girl is your sister?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Yes,&gt;&quot; Tatewaki said with a nod as he took the picture 
back from Cologne. &quot;&lt;Kodachi is my younger sister. We were 
separated when were children. I fear from what Xian-pu has told 
me her life was not as fortunate as my own. I can only shudder 
to think of what led her to pursue the life of crime that has been 
described.&gt;&quot; He lifted his eyes to meet Cologne&#39;s and pleaded, 
&quot;&lt;I beg of you honored Elder, do not execute my sister! I will do 
anything that you ask of me. But please... do not do this.&gt;&quot;
	Looking into Tatewaki&#39;s tear filled eyes Cologne said 
grimly, &quot;&lt;The punishment has already been put into motion 
Tatewaki. Our tribal Enforcer has been sent to locate your sister 
and deliver sentence upon her.&gt;&quot; She gave a soft sigh as she 
continued, &quot;&lt;The punishment was decided by the entire council 
of Elders. It will not be easy to convince them to change their 
minds. I need you to pledge your complete loyalty to our tribe. 
If we are able to rescue your sister she also must pledge her 
loyalty and subservience to us. She also must accept any new 
punishment that we decree. Do you agree to these conditions?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Yes, of course!&gt;&quot; replied Tatewaki quickly.
	&quot;&lt;Very well,&gt;&quot; said Cologne as she picked up her staff 
and clung to it once more. She then gazed down at him and said, 
&quot;&lt;Come. There is very little time in which to find Pur-fum and 
inform her to halt the execution. We must hurry if we are to 
succeed.&gt;&quot;
	With that, Cologne hopped out of the room leaving a 
stunned Ryoga, Shampoo, and Tatewaki behind her.

	&quot;&lt;Great Grandmother!&gt;&quot; called Shampoo as she dashed 
after Cologne who was bounding down the worn path towards 
the village.
	Cologne paused to face her Granddaughter then 
questioned, &quot;&lt;What is it Xian-pu?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Great Grandmother,&gt;&quot; repeated Shampoo. She halted 
whatever she was going to say next and glanced around quickly. 
Seeing that they were all alone Shampoo looked back to 
Cologne and said, &quot;&lt;I want to come with you. I want to help 
find Pur-fum and Tatewaki&#39;s sister.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Indeed?&gt;&quot; asked Cologne dryly. &quot;&lt;And what reasons 
would I have for taking you with me?&gt;&quot;
	 &quot;&lt;Great Grandmother!&gt;&quot; Shampoo wailed as she darted 
her gaze back at the approaching Tatewaki and Ryoga. &quot;&lt;You 
don&#39;t need a reason! You&#39;re the Matriarch... no one questions 
your decisions.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;I know that,&gt;&quot; said Cologne. She narrowed her gaze a 
notch then asked, &quot;&lt;How exactly did Mu-tsu end up gaining his 
Jusenkyo curse?&gt;&quot;
	At this question Shampoo looked incredibly 
uncomfortable then said hesitantly, &quot;&lt;I knocked him into the 
spring of drowned girl.&gt;&quot; Seeing Cologne&#39;s disapproval she 
exclaimed, &quot;&lt;Mu-tsu wouldn&#39;t stop bothering me and he 
attacked Tatewaki from behind! He&#39;s dishonorable!&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;I see,&gt;&quot; Cologne said thoughtfully as she gave 
Shampoo a searching gaze. &quot;&lt;You seem quite fond of this 
outlander called Tatewaki and you&#39;ve only just met. Could you 
tell me why this is? Normally if a boy attempts to fight your 
battles for you the results are... well. Less than favorable is a 
mild way to put it.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;I... I...&gt;&quot; Shampoo trailed off as she flushed bright red. 
&quot;&lt;I don&#39;t know... he&#39;s just different. He only interfered because 
he thought I was in danger. Later when he found out it was a 
duel he apologized to me for interrupting. He&#39;s...&gt;&quot; She lifted 
scarlet eyes and said, &quot;&lt;He&#39;s honorable. Tatewaki is an 
honorable person. Please let me join you on this quest. You 
know that I&#39;ve always dreamed of seeing the outside world. And 
I promise that if you decide take me along you won&#39;t regret it.&gt;&quot;
	There was a moment of silence before Cologne moved 
forward and said, &quot;&lt;No. I don&#39;t believe I will. Very well Xian-
pu. You may come along. Go back and ready our things. We 
will be leaving as soon as I have swayed the council into my 
way of thinking.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Xian-pu?&gt;&quot; called Tatewaki as he neared her. &quot;&lt;Is 
something going on?&gt;&quot;
	Turning to the pair Shampoo wore a wide smile on her 
pretty features as she said, &quot;&lt;Great Grandmother says that I can 
come with you on your journey!&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Truly?&gt;&quot; asked Tatewaki happily. Beaming, he looked 
to Ryoga and continued, &quot;&lt;Isn&#39;t this great news old friend? It 
seems that we shall no longer be alone in our quest! How 
delightful that both Xian-pu and her Great Grandmother will be 
joining us.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Heh,&gt;&quot; Ryoga released a tight laugh. Rubbing the 
back of his unruly head of hair he ripped his eyes away from 
Shampoo&#39;s voluptuous figure and said, &quot;&lt;Yeah. Whatever you 
say Tachi. The more the merrier.&gt;&quot;

	A blurred shadow bounded out of it&#39;s native hut to hide 
behind another. After doing this she paused to take a good look 
at her new body in the rather tight blue and silver pantsuit that 
she had put on. She was unusually curvaceous, perhaps even 
more than Shampoo. And her breasts! Mousse&#39;s eyes turned as 
wide as saucers.
	&quot;&lt;They&#39;re huge,&gt;&quot; she whispered as she stared at the two 
melons attached to her formerly flat chest. Mousse was about to 
give into the urge to touch them when the sound of sudden 
arguing interrupted her.
	&quot;&lt;What are you really planning Kho-lon?&gt;&quot; asked a 
suspicious voice that Mousse knew to be none other than her 
Great Aunt Lotion the Elder.
	&quot;&lt;Nothing,&gt;&quot; returned the voice of Cologne. &quot;&lt;The boy 
called Tatewaki has earned both my and Xian-pu&#39;s respect. He 
needs the help of our tribe and the fact that his sister is one of 
the demon thieves increases his value to us. This is an important 
mission and as such I am taking Xian-pu with me. Her skills will 
be needed.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Xian-pu?&gt;&quot; said Mousse softly as she pressed herself 
up against the hut. &quot;&lt;She&#39;s leaving with that outlander called 
Tatewaki?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;It sounds like you&#39;re playing the matchmaker,&gt;&quot; said 
Lotion with dry humor.
	&quot;&lt;I&#39;m doing nothing of the sort. Xian-pu asked to 
accompany me on this journey so she might see the outside 
world and I see no reason to refuse her,&gt;&quot; said Cologne.
	&quot;&lt;Right,&gt;&quot; Lotion said skeptically. &quot;&lt;I still think this is 
another one of your schemes.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Think what you like,&gt;&quot; said Cologne dismissively. 
Mousse instantly leapt backwards as she saw the Matriarch hop 
forward on her staff and into her line of vision. &quot;&lt;The Council 
has approved my plan and in the morning we will follow Pur-
fum&#39;s trail that has led her to Japan. According to the 
communications I&#39;ve received from her she&#39;s yet to find them so 
we still have time on our side.&gt;&quot; Mousse watched as Cologne 
tilted her head back to smile at Lotion. &quot;&lt;You will keep an eye 
on things for me, won&#39;t you?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Of course,&gt;&quot; replied Lotion. She was silent for a 
moment then she said, &quot;&lt;Don&#39;t take too long. You know how 
Be-dea misses your presence in Council.&gt;&quot;
	Meeting their gaze Cologne said, &quot;&lt;I&#39;ll keep that in 
mind.&gt;&quot;
	From her hidden position Mousse watched as both 
Cologne and Lotion exited then said to herself in hushed tones, 
&quot;&lt;Xian-pu is going to Japan with the outlanders? But why 
would she do that? Unless...&gt;&quot; Mousse trailed off despondently. 
&quot;&lt;Unless she really does like that outlander Tatewaki. Oh Xian-
pu...&gt;&quot; The raven haired girl released a soft sob then hastily 
wiping away her tears and straightening to her full height she 
said strongly, &quot;&lt;It doesn&#39;t matter! I made a vow and I&#39;m going to 
keep it. No one will ever interfere with Xian-pu&#39;s happiness 
again. I&#39;ll make sure of that. Even if I have to follow her to 
Japan to do it!&gt;&quot;

	Back at the cabin Tatewaki opened his eyes before going 
through his sword work with certain ease. His katana glinted in 
the sun as he completed the motions only to start them again. As 
he did this he thought on the day&#39;s events.
	The last thing he&#39;d expected was to end up with a curse 
that changed him into a ugly chicken...
	No, he corrected mentally, a phoenix. That was what the 
Guide called him. But apparently he turned into a phoenix that 
looked like a ugly chicken. Not very reassuring.
	He supposed he should be grateful that he didn&#39;t fall into 
a more ridiculous spring. Like the spring of drowned yeti riding 
a bull carrying a crane and eel.
	There were a lot of things that he knew he should be 
grateful for. His skills in the art, for one. If it hadn&#39;t been for his 
training he could&#39;ve ended up dead or fallen into a much worse 
spring. Tatewaki knew that he should be grateful for many of 
the things in his life .
	All his foster families had been kind to him, even if they 
didn&#39;t know how to help heal his broken heart. And it was only a 
stroke of luck that his Mistress had found him that night. He had 
just run away from his latest foster home after they&#39;d discovered 
the Kuno family katana he&#39;d always kept with him. Feeling that 
the weapon wasn&#39;t appropriate for an eight year boy, they had 
tried to take it away only to have Tatewaki run away with the 
katana in tow. That was when he ran into his Mistress.
	Literally.
	The force of the impact caused him to fall back on his 
butt and gaze up at a woman with a face both imperious and 
wise all at the same time. She had long black hair which was 
elegantly pulled back and luminous brown eyes. The kimono 
she wore was a beautiful light blue and served to make her look 
even more lady like. And from her seeped a power that 
Tatewaki had never sensed before.
	She gave him the smallest of smiles as she knelt down 
before him and eyed the katana that sat in his lap. &quot;What&#39;s a boy 
like you doing with a fine weapon like this?&quot; she asked with a 
lilting British accent.
	&quot;It&#39;s mine!&quot; declared Tatewaki fiercely as he pulled the 
katana to his chest. &quot;My mother gave it to me!&quot;
	&quot;Is that so?&quot; the woman asked. Her smile deepened as 
she continued, &quot;Did she teach you how to use it then?&quot;
	His tawny eyes wide Tatewaki reluctantly shook his 
head as he mumbled, &quot;She couldn&#39;t. She&#39;s dead.&quot;
	The woman considered this before she held her hand out 
to him. For a long moment Tatewaki stared at her hand until he 
finally accepted it as she pulled him to his feet.
	&quot;Would you like to know how to use it?&quot; she asked.
	Lifting his head Tatewaki looked into her gaze that 
reflected a fire he&#39;d never known and gave a short nod. The 
woman smiled at him and asked, &quot;What is your name?&quot;
	&quot;Kuno Tatewaki,&quot; said Tatewaki shyly as he followed 
after her and down the darkened street.
	&quot;A good name,&quot; the woman said in satisfaction. Looking 
to him she smiled then said, &quot;You may call me Mistress Azami.&quot;
	With that she took his hand in hers as they walked down 
the street. He wasn&#39;t sure how she had arranged it but somehow 
Mistress Azami became his legal guardian. So over the next 
seven years he trained in the woods of Kyoto.
	She was a harsh trainer but he enjoyed his years with her 
and had been sad when the day arrived for him to enter middle 
school. Sad because it meant leaving her and the only real home 
he had known in a long time. But he had to go to school and he 
had to look for his sister.
	Mistress Azami gave him the information that Kodachi 
had been living in with a foster family in Juuban a year ago and 
was thought to still live there still. So that was where he was 
headed and that was where she had arranged for him to continue 
his education.
	Unfortunately by the time he arrived in Juuban his sister 
was long gone, the foster family claiming that she had run away 
after a falling out with her boyfriend. On hearing this Tatewaki 
experienced his first flash of extreme anger since his mother&#39;s 
death. His sister was only fourteen and already she was dating?
	Finishing his sword work Tatewaki smoothly sliced 
through the air before sheathing his katana while he heaved deep 
breaths. That was three years ago. Her first boyfriend had 
caused her to runaway.
	What sort of man was Kodachi with now? Whoever he is 
he was obviously worse than her first boyfriend. It was  because 
of him that she was committing illegal acts. Or was it 
boyfriends? The information they had gathered said that she was 
traveling with two men. Was it possible that she could be 
involved with both of them romantically?
	Gritting his teeth together, Tatewaki tried to contain his 
anger and closing his eyes he blocked out any thoughts of 
Kodachi. It did him no good to worry needlessly when he 
couldn&#39;t do anything about it. All that mattered was that soon 
he&#39;d be with her and he could protect her again.
	And protect her especially from the influence of her so-
called boyfriends.

	&quot;&lt;He&#39;s good,&gt;&quot; commented Shampoo.
	She sat next to Ryoga on the porch of the cabin watching 
Tatewaki practice his sword work. It had been quite some time 
since she&#39;d seen anyone as skillful as Tatewaki and she found his 
technique beautiful to watch. There was a fluid grace in his 
movements that entranced her.
	&quot;&lt;Yeah,&gt;&quot; said Ryoga nervously. He slowly inched 
away from the Amazon and willed himself to remain calm.
	Ryoga hadn&#39;t broken out into a nosebleed and he wasn&#39;t 
eager to start now. For some unfathomable reason girls made 
him nervous. His family had tried to help him with his problem 
but nothing worked. So Ryoga just had to accept it as a part of 
who he was. It was simple logic to him that anytime a girl got to 
close he either passed out or broke out into a violent nosebleed. 
Lucky for him he spent most of his time with boys and not girls 
or else he&#39;d never be able to keep up his training in the art.
	Take it easy, he told himself, just remember what Dad 
told you. Closing his eyes Ryoga heard the voice of his father 
from when he&#39;d given him advice about his anxiety around the 
opposite sex. Just pretend that they&#39;re men and then you&#39;ll have 
no problems talking to them. They may smack you around some 
but at least you&#39;ll be able to have a conversation with them. If 
that doesn&#39;t work pretend they&#39;re something asexual, like a rock. 
But whatever you do, boy, make sure you don&#39;t make eye 
contact. I&#39;ve noticed that&#39;s when it all goes downhill. Don&#39;t look 
at her and you&#39;ll do fine.
	&quot;&lt;So,&gt;&quot; Shampoo said as she looked at him. &quot;&lt;How did 
you two meet, anyway?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;At lunch,&gt;&quot; said Ryoga shyly as he averted his eyes. 
&quot;&lt;Tachi just transferred to the same school as me and he got into 
a fight with my brother.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;And that&#39;s how you became friends?&gt;&quot; asked 
Shampoo incredulously.
	&quot;&lt;Yeah,&gt;&quot; Ryoga said with a soft laugh. &quot;&lt;But it&#39;s not 
like it sounds. My brother and I always fight over food. It&#39;s just 
how we were raised. Tachi didn&#39;t know that though so he figured 
I was being picked on and he intervened.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Sounds like what he did today,&gt;&quot; murmured Shampoo 
thoughtfully.
	Keeping his eyes focused on the ground Ryoga nodded 
his head and said, &quot;&lt;Exactly like that. Anyway, when we 
explained it all to him he was awfully sorry and we all got to be 
friends. Well, sort of. Tachi and my brother can barely stand 
each other. I don&#39;t know why.&gt;&quot; Ryoga paused then mused, &quot;&lt;I 
guess they&#39;re just too different. The only thing they have in 
common is sword training and that made them more competitive 
with each other.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;And do you fight with any weapons?&gt;&quot; asked 
Shampoo curiously.
	&quot;&lt;Just my fists,&gt;&quot; Ryoga replied proudly. &quot;&lt;I&#39;m the 
weaponless heir to my family&#39;s school of martial arts. My 
brother was taught to fight with and without weapons. He 
learned mixed styles while my fighting style is pure and goes 
along with the oldest traditions of our school.&gt;&quot;
	There was another long pause as Shampoo watched 
Tatewaki run through his sword routine before she became 
irritated with the silence and asked, &quot;&lt;How long have you been 
traveling together?&gt;&quot;
	A bit surprised that Shampoo was resuming their 
conversation Ryoga said slowly, &quot;&lt;About a year. We started off 
traveling with my father and brother but we ended up getting 
separated because of me. We&#39;ve been traveling alone over since 
as we try to look for our families.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Why did you get separated from yours?&gt;&quot; asked 
Shampoo curiously. &quot;&lt;It sounds like Tatewaki and his sister 
were torn apart but what about you?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;I got lost,&gt;&quot; mumbled Ryoga, making sure his eyes 
remained fixated on the ground.
	Shampoo blinked as she thought about his words then 
finally she said, &quot;&lt;You what?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;I got lost,&gt;&quot; repeated Ryoga as he flushed red. &quot;&lt;I 
have a problem with directions... I guess you could say that I 
inherited it because my Mom has it too.&gt;&quot; Still staring at the 
ground he mulled on this a moment before he said, &quot;&lt;Tachi was 
traveling with my family on our training journey so that he 
could improve in the art and search for his sister. One day we 
were at this street fighting tournament in Tokyo and got 
separated from my family in the crowd.&gt;&quot; With a sigh Ryoga 
said, &quot;&lt;And the next thing I know we&#39;re in Osaka.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Osaka?&gt;&quot; Shampoo blinked again. &quot;&lt;Isn&#39;t that sort of 
far from where you started off?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Yeah,&gt;&quot; said Ryoga as he gave a weak and nervous 
laugh while he stared at the ground. &quot;&lt;Really far.&gt;&quot;
	Shampoo thought on his words for a moment before she 
asked, &quot;&lt;Do you get lost often?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;All the time,&gt;&quot; said Ryoga sadly. &quot;&lt;This is the first 
time I&#39;ve been separated from my brother though. Well, there 
was this time when I was five but it was only for a week. This 
has been for over a year...&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;You must miss him a lot,&gt;&quot; said Shampoo as she 
observed the now melancholy lost boy.
	At this Ryoga nodded dimly as he said, &quot;&lt;I miss all of 
them. My family are the only people besides Tachi that I&#39;m 
really close to. I hate being away from them.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;I&#39;m sorry,&gt;&quot; Shampoo said. Unsure of what to say next 
she offered haplessly, &quot;&lt;I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll find them once we 
reach Japan. Maybe we can help.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Thank you,&gt;&quot; said Ryoga with soft emotion. He was 
so touched by her words that he lifted his head to look into her 
eyes and his reaction was immediate.
	First it was seeing her charming smile then it was seeing 
her scarlet eyes shining with concern and then it was seeing the 
sight of her slightly exposed cleavage. When all of these were 
combined it took less than a second for Ryoga to faint.
	Observing this with wide eyes Shampoo said, &quot;&lt;Was it 
something I said?&gt;&quot;

	After Tatewaki managed to wake his friend and reassure 
Shampoo that Ryoga was fine the two boys decided they should 
go to bed early. This left Shampoo with Cologne who had been 
silent almost the entire evening.
	&quot;&lt;Great Grandmother?&gt;&quot; asked Shampoo hesitantly 
when they were alone. &quot;&lt;Is something wrong?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;I&#39;m fine,&gt;&quot; Cologne replied softly. Giving Shampoo a 
reassuring smile she continued, &quot;&lt;You should go get some 
sleep. We have a long day tomorrow.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;All right,&gt;&quot; said Shampoo. She wore a worried 
expression as she left the cabin to head to her quarters that she 
normally shared with Perfume.
	Now alone, Cologne stared into the flames of the dying 
fire and murmured, &quot;&lt;And so it begins.&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;A plane,&gt;&quot; said Ryoga in wonder as he pressed his 
nose to the glass. &quot;&lt;We&#39;re actually going to ride on a plane 
Tachi! I can&#39;t remember the last time I got to do that. Usually 
Dad made us walk or swim places in our travels.&gt;&quot;
	After a near five hour drive the group had finally arrived 
at the nearest airport, which was quite small with the limited 
amount of travel in the area, to wait for their plane. Three hours 
had passed since they first arrived at the airport but it had finally 
been announced that their flight was prepped and readying for 
passengers to board.
	&quot;&lt;It is a rare treat indeed,&gt;&quot; agreed Tatewaki with an 
easy smile. Turning his tawny gaze to Shampoo he said, &quot;&lt;I 
thank you for your generous assistance in our transport to Japan. 
We are not used to such kindness. Truly you and your people are 
of excellent character.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Thank you,&gt;&quot; said Shampoo as she flushed quietly. 
Averting her eyes she watched as their plane moved into the 
final stages before they were allowed to board. &quot;&lt;But it was all 
Great Grandmother&#39;s doing. She is a woman of some influence 
on many levels in my country.&gt;&quot; She paused then met 
Tatewaki&#39;s gaze and said hesitantly, &quot;&lt;What of your parents? 
Were they of some importance? They must have been from the 
way you speak...&gt;&quot; As Tatewaki&#39;s earnest gaze bore into her 
Shampoo trailed off nervously.
	Tatewaki gave a wan smile then replied, &quot;&lt;My parents 
were quite wealthy. At least my mother was. She died when 
Kodachi and I were children. This left us alone with my 
father,&gt;&quot; he hissed the last word viciously. &quot;&lt;He squandered all 
of the money Mother left us and when it was gone he turned to 
less legal means of gaining monetary funds. That was when 
social services discovered our state of near bankruptcy. When 
they found out the depths of his maltreatment of myself and 
Kodachi they took us from him. An event that to this day I 
grateful for,&gt;&quot; said Tatewaki solemnly.
	&quot;&lt;I fear that if Kodachi and I had stayed with our Father 
for one moment more he would have driven us to madness,&gt;&quot; 
Tatewaki confessed. &quot;&lt;Fortunately we did not stay but our 
repose was slight as we were soon separated due to the fact that 
many were reluctant to foster two children with... eccentricities 
such as ours.&gt;&quot; Tatewaki sighed and gave another wan smile. 
&quot;&lt;I can&#39;t describe how much it hurt to be separated from 
Kodachi. She is my only family. The only family I want and 
shall ever have. So I made it my quest in life to find her once 
again. It is my duty as her older brother to find and protect her. 
That is what my Mother told me on her death bed and that is 
why I search for Kodachi. It is why I must find her now and 
prevent her horrible fate from occurring. I could not bear to lose 
her.&gt;&quot;
	Looking at Tatewaki with sad scarlet eyes Shampoo 
gently touched his forearm and said, &quot;&lt;Please don&#39;t worry 
Tatewaki. We&#39;ll find your sister and stop Pur-fum from 
delivering sentence. I stake my honor on it.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Such a promise is unnecessary,&gt;&quot; said Tatewaki softly 
as he covered Shampoo&#39;s hand with his own. &quot;&lt;But I thank you. 
I can&#39;t express how much your understanding means to me. 
Lesser people would have considered me an enemy because of 
the way that we were introduced to one another. I am grateful 
that you are not such a person. Truly you are rare flower, Xian-
pu.&gt;&quot;
	At this Shampoo blushed deeply but before she could 
reply Cologne approached and announced, &quot;&lt;Come. I have 
gained us an early admittance onto the flight.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Really?&gt;&quot; asked Ryoga excitedly as he spun around. 
&quot;&lt;That&#39;s great! I want the window seat!&gt;&quot; As he shouted this the 
lost boy dashed in the general vicinity of where their plane was 
boarding.
	Watching this, Tatewaki murmured, &quot;&lt;I best go and help 
him find the gate or our departure will be delayed by a minimum 
of twenty four hours at the least.&gt;&quot;
	After his exit Cologne gave her Shampoo a curious look 
which caused her to flush beet red before she dashed after 
Tatewaki. And observing this Cologne chuckled.

	&quot;Whoah,&quot; said Ryoga in amazement. Leaning forward he 
pressed his nose against the small portal window of the plane to 
look at the ground several miles below. The window fogged up 
from his breath and he pulled back to wipe it off as he grinned. 
&quot;This is really cool, you should check it out. Everything looks 
miniature.&quot;
	Dipping his head forward Tatewaki gazed out the 
window and smiled softly. &quot;It is a wondrous sight indeed. In 
some ways it reminds me of--&quot; Tatewaki stopped his speech 
abruptly as the plane jerked slightly and turning gray he held his 
seat&#39;s armrests in a death grip.
	Ryoga observed his friend&#39;s behavior and questioned, 
&quot;You all right? You&#39;re not afraid are you?&quot;
	&quot;Afraid?&quot; scoffed Tatewaki as he continued to grip the 
arms of the chair tightly. &quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous! It takes more than 
a few shakes of an airplane to bring fear to the spirit of Kuno 
Tatewaki! I&#39;m perfectly--&quot;
	The plane received another sharp jerk and Tatewaki 
paled even further to look as white as a sheet. Ryoga saw this 
and shook his head in a bemused action.
	&quot;There&#39;s nothing to be scared of,&quot; said Ryoga helpfully. 
&quot;Airplanes are perfectly safe--&quot;
	&quot;I know that!&quot; exclaimed Tatewaki with offense. &quot;And 
for the last time I&#39;m not scared! I&#39;m simply testing the strength of 
my arm rests...&quot;
	&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; said Ryoga skeptically.
	Gritting his teeth Tatewaki said tightly, &quot;For the last time 
Ryoga-kun... I am not frightened, nor am I scared. All I need is 
time to adapt to air travel. That is all.&quot;
	Seeming to contemplate this, Ryoga turned his attention 
back to the window when suddenly the plane jerked again and 
Tatewaki released a scream of terror. Heaving a deep sigh 
Ryoga said, &quot;This is going to be a long flight.&quot;

	Wondering about the outbursts coming from across the 
isle from their traveling companions Shampoo decided to try 
and ignore their shouts. After all, she should be focusing her 
attention on what Cologne was currently telling her.
	&quot;&lt;We must stop Pur-fum from delivering sentence but it 
will be difficult to dissuade her. She left us in a state of absolute 
fury,&gt;&quot; said Cologne. &quot;&lt;I assume that you know better than I the 
reason behind her anger?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Yes,&gt;&quot; said Shampoo hesitantly. &quot;&lt;I&#39;m sorry but I 
can&#39;t tell you, Great Grandmother. It&#39;s... well...&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Private?&gt;&quot; Cologne asked dryly with a raised 
eyebrow. &quot;&lt;Don&#39;t fret child. I wasn&#39;t expecting you to divulge 
your Cousin&#39;s secrets to me. I just want you to be prepared to 
take on your role as mediator. Someone must calm Pur-fum&#39;s 
wrath when we arrive and as her closest companion you are the 
best suited to do that.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Why don&#39;t you just tell her to stop?&gt;&quot; asked Shampoo 
nonplused. &quot;&lt;You know she&#39;ll do whatever you tell her Great 
Grandmother. Pur-fum is loyal to you.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Well,&gt;&quot; said Cologne slowly. &quot;&lt;I do plan on telling 
her that the judgment was altered but if I know Pur-fum she 
won&#39;t take the news well. I need someone to explain the logistics 
of the situation to her. That&#39;s where you step in. Do you 
understand?&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;No,&gt;&quot; Shampoo replied. &quot;&lt;But I&#39;ll do as you say.&gt;&quot;
	&quot;&lt;Good,&gt;&quot; said Cologne in tones of deep satisfaction. 
&quot;&lt;That&#39;s very good.&gt;&quot;
	Looking at her Great Grandmother with some wariness 
Shampoo turned to gaze out the window. Only then did she 
realize that she was trapped. There was no place for her to run 
and that meant one thing and one thing only.
	That Cologne was going to take advantage of this by 
going into her usual spiel about Shampoo&#39;s duties as the 
Champion of her tribe. She was doomed.
	&quot;&lt;Xian-pu,&gt;&quot; Cologne chided. &quot;&lt;You shouldn&#39;t day 
dream so much. When I was your age...&gt;&quot;
	Shampoo closed her eyes as Cologne went into her long 
line of speeches. It was going to be a long flight.

	Mousse gritted her teeth together and attempted to move 
a millimeter inside the large crate she was shipping herself in. 
The storage space in the plane was limited but she had managed 
to be sent on the same flight that Shampoo was on. True, she 
was feeling claustrophobic, but it was all worth it to keep her 
vow to Shampoo. She would never again allow harm to come to 
the other girl.
	&quot;&lt;I stake my life on it!&gt;&quot; cried Mousse passionately. She 
jumped up only to hit her head on the wooden top of the crate 
that she was sealed inside.
	With a groan Mousse collapsed as her body was mashed 
uncomfortably inside the crate. Maybe, she thought warily, I 
should have planned my mode of travel a little more extensively. 
It was going to be a long flight.

	It had been a long flight for the plane&#39;s crew. When they 
had finally landed they were all planning to sacrifice one of the 
four troublesome passengers onboard to the great god of airline 
travel.
	Especially the passenger who used archaic speech and 
was constantly requesting a glass of cold water while his 
companion immediately dismissed the order. After this had 
happened several times the crew decided to ignore whatever 
requests the pair made. Unfortunately the poetry spouter decided 
to go get cold water on his own which led to a rather violent 
confrontation with his companion in the small aisle of the plane. 
The brawl went on for several minutes with the poetry spouter 
screaming something about him being able to escape a fiery 
death by being a feathered friend as the other boy telling him in 
turn that he was in fact a needless coward. However their 
conflict ended quickly when the shrunken troll woman that was 
apparently leading the group of miscreants knocked them both 
out with her staff, much to the dismay of the punk rocker girl 
traveling with her. The girl sported a shock of dyed lavender 
hair that even the most flamboyantly gay member of their crew 
found extreme.
	Needless to say the crew was ecstatic to see these 
passengers exit their plane. They had just gathered around to 
discuss the maniacs inhabiting their flight when a loud crash 
sounded from the cargo bay. Seconds later, a gorgeous girl with 
long raven hair appeared from the back of the plane and 
recklessly barreled through the crew.
	Crushed on the floor of the plane, the entire crew for 
Good Luck, China Airlines international flight 109 decided that 
it was long past time for a vacation.
