<a href="../ranma/blakrose-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre> 	&quot;What do you mean Kasumi slept in?&quot; Soun 
asked. &quot;She never  sleeps in! Is she sick? That&#39;s 
it isn&#39;t it? My baby is sick!&quot; He  immediately 
burst into tears as Nabiki watched him in certain  
exasperation. 

	Across from Soun and still playing shogi 
Genma said  carelessly, &quot;She didn&#39;t cook dinner 
last night either.&quot; 

	Reading this out of the corner of his eye 
Soun began sobbing  louder as he cried, &quot;He&#39;s 
right! Kasumi never misses cooking a meal!  She is 
sick!&quot; 

	Sighing at this Nabiki said, &quot;She&#39;s not sick 
Daddy. I swear.  She&#39;s just sleeping in that&#39;s all. 
Kasumi does so much for us that we  can allow her 
that, can&#39;t we?&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah Dad,&quot; Akane chimed in happily as she 
walked into the  room holding a tray full of a 
strange gooey substance that was  somehow burnt and 
reeking of toxins. &quot;Let Kasumi sleep in. Besides,  
I&#39;ve cooked enough food for all of us!&quot; 

	At this Soun began wailing again and Nabiki 
let loose a heavy  sigh. She rose to her feet and 
said, &quot;Try to calm Daddy down Akane.  I&#39;m going to 
go check on Kasumi.&quot; 

	Walking upstairs she wondered what became of 
her business  partners. Ranma and Kodachi hadn&#39;t 
returned ever since the antics of  the naked girl 
who was otherwise known as Perfume. Still mulling 
over  this, Nabiki paused at the door to Kasumi&#39;s 
bedroom. 

	Knocking on the door, Nabiki said, &quot;Oneechan? 
Are you  feeling okay?&quot; 

	When she got no response Nabiki hesitantly 
opened the door  but when she got it halfway open 
she froze in clear shock. She then  slowly backed 
out of the doorway and mechanically walked down the  
hall to stand at the top of the stairs. Once she&#39;d 
done this, Nabiki  proceeded to release a scream at 
the top of her lungs. 

	In seconds, her father was in front of her 
wearing a worried  expression. Walking lazily 
behind him was Genma who appeared  vaguely curious 
about her yelling. 

	&quot;What is it?!&quot; asked Soun in a rush. &quot;Is 
something wrong  Nabiki?! Where&#39;s Kasumi?!&quot; 

	Unable to give a response, Nabiki simply 
turned to point at the  open door to Kasumi&#39;s 
bedroom. Dashing down the hallway in a rush,  the 
dojo occupants piled in front of the door to take 
it a sight that  caused all their eyes to go wide. 

	Lying on the bed entwined in an embrace were 
the forms of  Kasumi and Perfume. The blanket 
covered their bodies so it was hard  to tell 
whether they were naked or not but the scene itself 
was  incriminating. The Enforcer slowly popped open 
one sapphire eye and  reluctantly she untangled 
herself from Kasumi to stare at the group. 

	&quot;What you do here?&quot; asked Perfume blearily. 
She moved into  a sitting position and the sheet 
fell to reveal a crumpled robe. 

	The group found themselves much like Nabiki 
in their loss of  speech. They simply stared at the 
Enforcer who was perplexed about  their reactions. 

	After a long silence, Nabiki recovered from 
her shock and  pushed past the group to stalk into 
the room. &quot;What have you done to  Kasumi?! You... 
you... molester!&quot; she shouted. 

	&quot;Molester?&quot; Perfume blinked in confusion. 
&quot;What you talking  about? Kasumi is Airen. Supposed 
to sleep with.&quot; 

	The middle Tendo sister was twitching in rage 
when suddenly  the onset of loud sobbing was heard 
and she didn&#39;t have to turn around  to know who it 
was. Soun was clinging helplessly to the door frame 
as  he wailed, &quot;Kasumi! My baby&#39;s been deflowered!&quot; 

	Behind him a nonchalant Genma shrugged and 
said, &quot;It had to  happen eventually.&quot; 

	Just as Soun set about strangling Genma for 
saying that a  puzzled Akane stuck her head into 
the room and said, &quot;What&#39;re you all  doing in here? 
You haven&#39;t even tried some of my special breakfast  
yet.&quot; Following their stares she focused on the bed 
and the figure of  Perfume. &quot;Hi again!&quot; said Akane 
cheerfully. &quot;It looks like you&#39;re  recovered.&quot; 

	It was then that Kasumi finally woke up and 
on seeing the  group gathered in her bedroom she 
pulled the sheets closer to her  body. With wide 
eyes she realized the position that she had just 
been  caught in and what everyone must be thinking. 
Realizing all this,  Kasumi could say only one 
thing about the situation. 

	&quot;Oh my.&quot; 

--- 

	&quot;Nine hundred and fifty thousand yen,&quot; Ranma 
counted as he  sifted through the large wad of 
money in his hand. &quot;Not too bad for a  few hours of 
work.&quot; 

	&quot;How right you are my dearest,&quot; said Kodachi 
while hooking  her arm in his. &quot;What shall we be 
doing with our earnings? Perhaps use  it to allay 
our resident stalker?&quot; 

	&quot;Maybe,&quot; mused Ranma. He looked up into the 
air as he  stuffed the money into his pocket. &quot;But 
only if she won&#39;t get off our  backs. I don&#39;t like 
the idea of giving money away for no reason.&quot; 

	&quot;A most apt point,&quot; murmured Kodachi. &quot;I 
agree that we  should only make retribution if she 
continues to act in a violent manner  towards us. 
It serves no real purpose to allow her to upset the 
Tendos  on our behalf. Don&#39;t you agree about that, 
Ranma darling?&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma said slowly. &quot;The last thing we 
want is for  Tendo-san to kick us out. Especially 
when we&#39;re getting so close to  figuring everything 
out.&quot; 

	&quot;That reminds me,&quot; said Kodachi as she looked 
at him with  hopeful violet eyes. &quot;Did you have any 
luck in locating my brother&#39;s  family services 
caseworker?&quot; 

	&quot;It&#39;s the funniest thing,&quot; said Ranma. &quot;The 
guy said that Kuno  got adopted by some British 
lady and only a month afterwards they  just 
disappeared without a trace.&quot; Cobalt eyes met 
Kodachi&#39;s gaze and  he continued, &quot;I know that 
nothing bad happened to him because he  was fine 
when I met him back in middle school but this is 
just weird. I  can&#39;t figure who this lady is or 
what she has to do with Kuno.&quot; 

	 Forming a thoughtful expression, Kodachi 
said, &quot;It seems that  my brother has found a 
generous benefactor to care for him. How very  
fortuitous.&quot; 

	&quot;For him or us?&quot; asked Ranma with a sly 
smile. 

	&quot;For both, of course,&quot; replied Kodachi as she 
matched his  smile before giving him a soft kiss on 
the lips. 

	When she pulled away, Ranma&#39;s smile widened 
as he repeated  smoothly, &quot;Of course.&quot; 

--- 

	&quot;My little girl is a lesbian!&quot; Soun bawled. 

	&quot;So she likes to eat fish,&quot; remarked Genma 
who was soon  being strangled again by an enraged 
Soun. 

	Before Soun could do any real damage to the 
other man  Nabiki gave a sigh and rose to her feet 
then in a casual movement she  dumped a bucket of 
cold water on them. The reaction was immediate,  
Soun calmed down and Genma morphed into a big fat 
flying pig. 

	While Perfume began snickering at Genma&#39;s 
cursed form  Kasumi looked to the shivering Soun. 

	&quot;Father,&quot; said Kasumi with a pained 
expression. She fingered  her crumpled dress that 
she had slept in. &quot;I do wish that you wouldn&#39;t  say 
things like that. I&#39;ve already told you that we 
didn&#39;t do anything.&quot; 

	&quot;Airen,&quot; said Perfume as she ripped her eyes 
away from  Genma pig. The Enforcer had abandoned 
the terrycloth robe from  earlier and was wearing 
one of Akane&#39;s spare volleyball uniforms.  &quot;Why he 
so upset?&quot; 

	Scowling at this question Nabiki interrupted 
her older sister  and said, &quot;Maybe he&#39;s upset 
because he caught you in bed with my  Oneechan! 
You... you... evil seductress!&quot; 

	&quot;I think they make a nice couple,&quot; said Akane 
as she smiled  widely. She turned to Perfume and 
continued, &quot;I also think that having  Amazons for 
in laws would be cool!&quot; 

	&quot;Much thanks,&quot; said Perfume to the smiling 
Akane. 

	&quot;No prob,&quot; Akane called. She left the sitting 
room to return  shortly with a kettle of hot water. 
Pouring it on Genma pig&#39;s head she  said, &quot;It&#39;s a 
good thing that we had this sitting on the stove, 
huh  Ojisama Saotome?&quot; 

	While the steam evaporated to reveal his 
human form Genma  straightened his glasses and 
said, &quot;Thank you Akane.&quot; 

	&quot;No prob,&quot; repeated Akane in chipper tones as 
she left the  sitting room for the kitchen again. 

	&quot;Now,&quot; said Genma in solemn tones as he 
looked to Soun. &quot;I  think you should stop making 
such a big fuss out of this Tendo. We&#39;ve  dealt 
with Amazons before so stop acting like this sort 
of thing is new  to you. And just look at the 
situation I have with my wives.&quot; 

	As Soun considered his words Nabiki looked at 
Genma  suspiciously. &quot;Wives?&quot; she asked. &quot;What are 
you talking about?&quot; 

	Wearing a definite smirk Genma folded his 
arms across his  chest and said, &quot;Just the details 
of my personal life.&quot; Nabiki narrowed  her eyes at 
this reply and Genma turned his attention back to 
Soun.  &quot;So,&quot; he began. &quot;You calmed down about this 
yet?&quot; 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Soun in grating tones of 
annoyance. &quot;I was never  that upset. It was just 
that seeing my little girl like that was...&quot; He  
trailed off as he focused his gaze on Kasumi and 
Perfume. There was a  long moment of tension as 
Soun gave Perfume a hard stare. Then  suddenly, he 
slammed his hands down on the table. &quot;I must know  
now! Will you vow to always treat my Kasumi well?!&quot; 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Perfume with a short nod. &quot;I give 
you my solemn  vow to always treat Kasumi well. If 
I don&#39;t I&#39;ll let you kill me,&quot; she  finished in 
grave tones. 

	&quot;Excuse me?&quot; said Kasumi in disbelief as she 
watched this odd  pact being made between her 
father and Perfume. 

	Before she could say anything more on the 
matter Soun broke  out into a wide smile and 
quickly leapt across the table to pull Perfume  
into a hug. &quot;Then welcome to the family!&quot; he 
exclaimed happily. 

	&quot;Yeah!&quot; Akane cheered as she mimicked her 
father and began  to hug the Amazon Enforcer also. 
&quot;Welcome!&quot; 

	At this display, Nabiki scowled and Kasumi 
watched with  wide eyes as her new Airen started to 
turn purple from the lack of  oxygen caused by the 
multiple hugs. Nabiki was about to comment  when a 
soft voice said, &quot;Nabchan.&quot; 

	Nabiki moved her hazel gaze towards the voice 
and saw  Ranma&#39;s head hanging upside down outside 
of the sitting room. He  gave a silent gesture 
towards the roof before his head disappeared. 

	She had just risen to her feet when Perfume 
finally succeeded  in freeing herself from the 
confines of the Tendo group hug. Standing  up, 
Perfume produced her double bladed axes and brushed 
past  Nabiki to stand on the porch. With a swift 
leap she vanished from sight  then seconds later 
the figure of Ranma came bounding down from the  
roof with Kodachi hot on his heels. Trailing after 
them was Perfume  with the same deadly intent as 
day before. 

	&quot;Demon thieves!&quot; Perfume shouted as she 
pursued the couple.  &quot;You not escape!&quot; 

	&quot;Well this is fun,&quot; said Nabiki in dry tones. 
&quot;It looks like your  little wife is trying to kill 
Ranma and Dachi again.&quot; 

	Kasumi observed the pursuit with wide eyes 
before she  cleared her throat and said what could 
be construed as harsh tones for  her, &quot;Perfume! 
Stop it right now!&quot; 

	Immediately, the Amazon Enforcer froze in her 
tracks and  seeing their opportunity for escape, 
Ranma and Kodachi disappeared  from the premises 
once again. Perfume scowled at this and walked  
towards Kasumi with a dark expression on her pretty 
features. 

	&quot;This best be important, Airen,&quot; said 
Perfume. 

	&quot;Oh it is,&quot; said Kasumi in soft tones that 
somehow held a hint  of steel. &quot;Perfume,&quot; she began 
slowly. &quot;You will stop attacking Ranma  and 
Kodachi. They are guests of my family and as such 
you should  treat them with respect.&quot; 

	&quot;Stop?&quot; Perfume repeated incredulously. &quot;They 
is demon  thieves. Is my sacred duty to--&quot; 

	&quot;Destroy them, yes I know,&quot; said Kasumi. She 
paused to  produce the booklet of Amazon law from 
the folds of her dress. &quot;That  may be true but I&#39;m 
your Airen. I was the one who defeated you in  
battle and that means I&#39;m the dominant partner in 
this relationship.  Which also means that you have 
to do what I tell you to. And I&#39;m  telling you to 
leave Ranma and Kodachi alone. If you don&#39;t I&#39;ll 
have  to...&quot; She trailed off with a thoughtful 
expression. Finally Kasumi  settled on saying in 
ominous tones, &quot;Punish you.&quot; 

	With that, Kasumi turned on her heel and left 
a stunned  Perfume standing in the sitting room. 
Akane crossed to the Enforcer&#39;s  side and patted 
her on the shoulder. 	 	&quot;Oneechan&#39;s pretty 
strict at times,&quot; offered Akane in  sympathetic 
tones. While Perfume&#39;s sapphire eyes went wide in 
certain  distress at this comment, Akane exclaimed, 
&quot;It&#39;s time for school! I can&#39;t  be late, not 
today!&quot; 

	&quot;Strict,&quot; said Perfume dimly as Akane dashed 
out of the room  with a stronger dose of her usual 
frenzy of energy. 

	Shaking her head, Nabiki walked out of the 
room and said to  herself, &quot;Welcome to the family 
and good luck.&quot; 

--- 

	&quot;She was eating breakfast with them,&quot; 
murmured Kodachi in  thoughtful tones. &quot;How very... 
odd.&quot; 

	&quot;Odd? That&#39;s damn weird,&quot; said Ranma with a 
snort. 

	The pair had made a quick run to escape from 
the Tendo dojo  and were already halfway towards 
Furinkan. It would be the first time  since they&#39;d 
enrolled that they would be early for class. They 
always  left in time for class but lately the crowd 
of their admirers, which was  compounded by the 
fact that they walked to school with Akane,  caused 
them some problems. That was simply because of the 
time that  it took for them to maneuver through the 
crowd. 

	Maneuver through the crowd and try to retain 
the clothes on  their backs. Somehow they always 
seemed to lose bits of their clothes.  Well, not 
lose. More like bits of their clothes always seemed 
to be torn  from their bodies. 

	Yes, that was definitely a more apt 
description. It was lucky  for Ranma and Kodachi 
they didn&#39;t have any issues with their body  
persona or nudity. Very lucky indeed. 

	&quot;I&#39;m sure that they had a good reason for 
welcoming her into  their home,&quot; said Kodachi. 

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma replied as he shoved his hands 
into the  pockets of his pants. &quot;But what could it 
be?&quot; 

	Kodachi was about to reply when her violet 
eyes focused  ahead on the Furinkan High front 
lawn. She froze in place and  observing her 
behavior, a curious Ranma followed her gaze. He 
could  only blink at what he saw. 

	A totally empty lawn. 

	No one was there. Not a single student. Not 
even a school  security guard. Nobody. It was so 
empty that there might as well have  been a 
tumbleweed crossing the lawn to signify just how 
empty it was. 

	&quot;This day is getting odder by the moment,&quot; 
remarked Kodachi  as she inclined her raven head to 
one side. 

	Giving a silent nod, Ranma echoed, &quot;Yeah.&quot; 

	The couple was still standing at the entrance 
to the school  when seconds later, a strong wind 
kicked up and Akane went rushing  past them. Her 
ponytail flying in the wind, Kodachi stared at the 
large  dust cloud that had been left in Akane&#39;s 
wake and said, &quot;Odd.&quot; 

	&quot;Very,&quot; said Ranma. 

--- 

	Perfume was unhappy. 

	She didn&#39;t enjoy being yelled at. Especially 
by her new Airen.  And especially for only doing 
her duty as the Enforcer of Joketsuzoku.  Why 
couldn&#39;t Kasumi understand that and let her kill 
the demon  thieves already? 

	Forming a grimace, Perfume considered killing 
the demon  thieves against Kasumi&#39;s orders but 
thought better of it. Akane had  said that Kasumi 
had a tendency to be strict and there was the  
ominous way that her Airen had said the word 
punish. 

	Punish. The word echoed in Perfume&#39;s mind and 
she shivered  at the thought. Yes, she&#39;d obey her 
Airen&#39;s orders. 

	For now. 

	&quot;Perfume,&quot; called Kasumi as she walked out of 
the kitchen  wiping her hands on her apron. &quot;I need 
to buy a few things. Would you  like to go shopping 
with me?&quot; 

	Her sapphire eyes scanned Kasumi&#39;s features 
and finding  nothing but kindness there, Perfume 
replied, &quot;Yes. I like that, Airen.&quot; 

	&quot;Good,&quot; murmured Kasumi with a smile. 

--- 

	Furinkan High was frozen with fear. It was 
the most horrifying  time of year. It was the time 
that everyone dreaded coming about. It  was the 
time of the apocalypse. 

	It was time for the home economics midterm. 

	On this one day more than ninety percent of 
the students called  in sick and it was nearly 
impossible to get enough substitutes for all of  
the teacher absences. Because of the tendency for 
missing students  and teachers, the few who did 
show up for school were all placed in  the same 
room. 

	All in all, there were fifteen people in the 
home economics  class. Twelve of them wore anxious 
expressions, two of them just  looked confused, and 
one of them had a wide smile gracing her pretty  
features. 

	&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; said Ranma as he looked at 
Nabiki. &quot;What&#39;s  the big deal about Akane cooking 
some food? That don&#39;t sound so  scary to me.&quot; 

	&quot;You haven&#39;t eaten it,&quot; Nabiki whispered her 
hazel eyes  darkening with a grim light. 

	&quot;I&#39;m sure this is all an exaggeration,&quot; said 
Kodachi. &quot;How bad  could Akane-chan&#39;s cooking 
possibly be?&quot; 

	That was when a knock sounded on the 
classroom door and a  man, or what looked like a 
man, walked into the room wearing a  yellow 
biohazard suit and holding a huge metal briefcase 
of sorts. The  man looked at his clipboard then 
glanced up and waved at the class. 

	&quot;Hey everybody,&quot; the man said in muffled 
tones. &quot;Looks like  it&#39;s that time of year again.&quot; 
He paused to look at Akane who was  putting on her 
apron as the home economics teacher watched her 
with  a wary expression.  

	Akane turned around and broke into a wide 
smile.  &quot;Hasamato!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I didn&#39;t know 
you&#39;d be here! Are the  Furinkan High ghosts back 
again?&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah, well, some hauntings never go away you 
know,&quot; said  Hasamato as he gave a muffled laugh 
that was altogether anxious.  &quot;These darn ghosts. 
So what are you cooking this time, Akane-chan?&quot; 

	&quot;Ramen,&quot; said Akane with a wide smile. She 
paused to form a  troubled expression. &quot;You don&#39;t 
think that it might be possessed by  demons like my 
other meals, do you?&quot; 

	&quot;You can never be too careful,&quot; Hasamato said 
solemnly.  &quot;That&#39;s why they called me. To make sure 
that you stay nice and safe,  Akane-chan. Now you 
just go on and cook.&quot; 

	&quot;Okay, Hasamato!&quot; said Akane brightly before 
she turned  back to her home economics teacher. 

	&quot;Possessed ramen?&quot; Kodachi asked softly. 

	&quot;Shh,&quot; hissed Hasamato in muffled tones. He 
leaned down to  face her and said, &quot;That&#39;s the 
cover story we&#39;ve been using for the past  two 
years. Unless you want to be the one to tell Akane-
chan the truth  about her cooking.&quot; 

	At this statement Kodachi and Ranma exchanged 
a wary look  and Hasamato said, &quot;That&#39;s what I 
thought.&quot; He then took a seat at the  table across 
from them. When he sat down he put the metal 
briefcase  he held on the floor and it caused an 
echoing thud throughout the  classroom. Hasamato 
looked at Nabiki and smiled through the plastic  
mask and said, &quot;How&#39;re you doing Nabiki? It&#39;s been 
awhile.&quot; 

	&quot;I&#39;m good,&quot; said Nabiki with a smile. She 
leaned down to peer  at the briefcase. &quot;So that&#39;s 
your advanced metal alloy container, huh?  Are you 
sure that this one won&#39;t melt like the old one did? 
We can&#39;t  have a repeat of the curry disaster.&quot; 

	&quot;I&#39;m positive,&quot; Hasamato assured. He paused 
to slap the  briefcase and said, &quot;This baby has 
held up under nuclear radiation  testing. We think 
it can handle Akane-chan&#39;s cooking.&quot; 

	Hearing this comment, Ranma and Kodachi 
paled. 

--- 

	&quot;Nerima?&quot; asked Tatewaki with wide eyes. &quot;My 
sister has  journeyed to Nerima?&quot; 

	&quot;According to this letter from Perfume,&quot; 
Cologne replied. &quot;Is  there something particularly 
important about that district in Tokyo?&quot; 

	Snapping out of his dazed state Tatewaki 
offered an  apologetic smile. &quot;It is the location 
of our former dwellings,&quot; he said  earnestly. &quot;The 
ancestral home of my deceased mother. The 
illustrious  Kuno Mansion.&quot; 

	&quot;Nerima, huh?&quot; said Ryoga thoughtfully. &quot;My 
house is around  that area.&quot; 

	&quot;Nerima is that way,&quot; said Shampoo. She 
looked up from the  large map of Japan she was 
holding and pointed off into the distance.  &quot;If 
hurry can be there soon.&quot; 

	&quot;Then let&#39;s be off,&quot; said Tatewaki strongly. 
&quot;We can&#39;t allow  Perfume to complete her mission!&quot; 
Suddenly he leapt into the air and  began running 
on the rooftops on his way towards Nerima. 

	Shampoo watched his departure and shook her 
head as she  murmured, &quot;Perfume not be so easily 
stopped. It take much to keep  her from completing 
mission.&quot; 

	But seconds later she was racing after him 
with Ryoga running  at her side. Wearing a secret 
smile Cologne chuckled to herself before  she 
followed after her young companions on their way to 
Nerima. 

--- 

	Forming a face of annoyance, Perfume rubbed 
her nose and  wished that it would stop itching. 
She found it quite bothersome to feel  as if she 
was going to sneeze but then not do it. It was 
almost like her  body was toying with her. 

	With a sigh, she rocked back on her heels and 
watched with  attentive sapphire eyes as Kasumi 
scanned the contents of the shelf  with expertise. 
Quietly walking towards Kasumi&#39;s side, Perfume  
asked, &quot;This what you do?&quot; 

	&quot;What?&quot; asked Kasumi in pleasant tones as she 
turned to look  at Perfume. She smiled at the 
Enforcer then said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t  hear what 
you said. What was that?&quot; 

	&quot;This what you do?&quot; repeated Perfume. &quot;Airen 
is care taker of  family, yes? This what you do 
each day?&quot; 

	&quot;Most of the time,&quot; Kasumi acknowledged. &quot;The 
family needs  to eat so I buy their food.&quot; 

	&quot;And Kasumi cook food also,&quot; continued 
Perfume. &quot;And  Kasumi clean house, and Kasumi take 
care of all other things in house  no one else want 
do.&quot; 

	&quot;Of course,&quot; said Kasumi as if it were 
impossible for anyone to  assume otherwise. 

	Scowling at this, Perfume shoved her hands 
into her pockets  and grumbled, &quot;Is not right. 
Airen of Enforcer should not do such  things.&quot; 
Looking up with fierce sapphire eyes she said, &quot;You 
is  powerful figure in tribe now. This mean is able 
to have life of your  choosing. Not one of servant. 
You should go back home to tribe with  me, then all 
be well.&quot; 

	&quot;Perfume,&quot; said Kasumi softly. She smiled as 
she put the box  of cereal in the basket that she 
held. &quot;It isn&#39;t like that at all. I do what I  do 
because it makes me happy.&quot; 

	&quot;How that possible? You doing their work,&quot; 
Perfume said as  she eyed Kasumi with clear 
skepticism. 

	&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t know how 
exactly to explain  this...&quot; She was silent for a 
long while before her eyes lit up and she  said, 
&quot;Nothing makes me happier than helping others and 
making them  happy. And by caring for my family I 
see that in them every day. Do  you understand?&quot; 

	Studying Kasumi closely, Perfume folded her 
arms over her  chest and said gruffly, &quot;Understand 
but not like it. To care for others  make Kasumi 
happy. This is good but at same time it keep you 
from  having life of own.&quot; 

	&quot;What?&quot; whispered Kasumi as her eyes widened 
in shock.  &quot;What do you mean by that, Perfume?&quot; 

	&quot;I mean what say,&quot; retorted Perfume. She gave 
a sharp gesture  towards the shelf and said, &quot;This 
duty you have which make you happy  is trapping 
also! It no let you do what want, you lose your own 
wants  in theirs! Is no good!&quot; 

	There was a long moment of silence as Kasumi 
contemplated  these words and several frightened 
shoppers scurried past the strange  couple. Perfume 
was scowling deeply and had her arms folded across  
her chest. 

	&quot;Perfume,&quot; said Kasumi slowly as she looked 
up at the  Amazon Enforcer. &quot;Would you tell me 
more... about how you do  things back in your 
tribe?&quot; 

	Sapphire eyes widened in surprise then 
Perfume broke out into  a wide smile as she said, 
&quot;Of course, Airen.&quot; 

	Maybe she did have a chance of winning Kasumi 
over. But the  first thing she&#39;d have to do was 
make sure that her Airen stopped  coddling her 
family so much. If she broke the odd dependence 
Kasumi  had for caring for them then she&#39;d have 
more a chance to convince her  Airen to leave this 
odd country so they could return home to the tribe. 

	And that was something Perfume desperately 
wanted. 

	After she killed the demon thieves, of 
course. 

--- 

	&quot;And my American style apple pie?&quot; asked 
Akane with wide  plaintive brown eyes. 

	&quot;Possessed also,&quot; Hasamato replied in solemn 
but still muffled  tones. &quot;You know how these 
American foods, are Akane-chan.  They&#39;re just too 
decadent, they attract ghosts.&quot; 

	Hasamato then picked up the charred pie that 
somehow was  still bubbling over with blue goop 
with a pair of steel tongs before  putting it in 
his metal briefcase with the rest of Akane&#39;s 
cooking  projects. The rest of the room watched 
their interaction with wide eyes  as they silently 
thanked the man that was saving them from having to  
eat what Akane had cooked. 

	&quot;His acting is impeccable,&quot; murmured Kodachi 
softly. &quot;I almost  believe as if the food were 
truly possessed. Has he ever considered  going into 
the field of entertainment?&quot; 

	&quot;The Sun Never Sets,&quot; replied Nabiki lowly as 
she leaned  towards the gymnast. &quot;It&#39;s on the late 
afternoons. He plays the  honorable, but always 
drunken, doctor Ozuma.&quot; 

	&quot;So he&#39;s not a hazmat worker then?&quot; Ranma 
asked  incredulously while he kept his eyes on 
Hasamato. 

	Nabiki shook her head at this and said, &quot;No. 
He used to but  went freelance. The school hires 
him out to take care of Akane&#39;s  cooking projects. 
I hear they pay him nicely.&quot; 

	&quot;I would think so,&quot; Kodachi said. She was 
giving Hasamato a  look of admiration before she 
turned to Ranma and smirked. &quot;What do  you think, 
Ranma darling? Should we get you one of those 
suits?&quot; 

	 &quot;Nah,&quot; said Ranma slowly. &quot;They&#39;d cover up 
my handsome  figure and then where would I be?&quot; 

	Rolling her eyes at this comment, Nabiki 
watched as her  younger sister morosely observed as 
the last of her cooking was  placed in the metal 
briefcase. &quot;We just don&#39;t have the heart to tell 
her  that it&#39;s bad,&quot; said Nabiki. &quot;At times I&#39;ve 
tried but she gets this look.  It&#39;s like you just 
kicked her puppy dog or something and then it&#39;s all  
over. That&#39;s why most of the students aren&#39;t here 
today. They see that  look of hers and then they 
volunteer to eat her cooking. Last year  Akane 
inadvertently caused most of our freshman class to 
be  hospitalized for a semester. It wasn&#39;t pretty.&quot; 
	  	&quot;Huh,&quot; said Ranma thoughtfully. He got 
a strange look in his  eyes before he looked at 
Nabiki and wore his usual charming smile as  he 
asked, &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; 

	Looking at him with solemn eyes, Nabiki said, 
&quot;We help with  the clean up.&quot; Rising to her feet 
she slapped Ranma on the shoulder  and said, &quot;Lucky 
you, Saotome. You&#39;ll be able to wear that biohazard  
suit after all.&quot; 

	Ranma&#39;s only response was to look miserable. 

--- 

	&quot;This is Nerima?&quot; asked Ryoga blankly. He 
scratched his head  and murmured, &quot;It doesn&#39;t look 
all that bad to me. No fighting, no  explosions. I 
wonder where all those rumors about it being worse 
than  Tomobiki came from?	 

	&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re speaking of, Ryoga-
kun,&quot; said  Tatewaki. &quot;Nerima is a fine district to 
live in and I recall it as being  perfectly normal 
when I resided here as a child.&quot; 

	Before Tatewaki could say anything more on 
the matter a  truck with the words &#39;Akane-chan&#39;s 
Volunteer Biohazard Unit&#39; written  on the side of 
it went blazing past them on the road leaving them  
stunned in its wake. 

	After a moment, Ryoga said, &quot;What was it that 
you just said  about Nerima being normal, Tachi?&quot; 

	Tatewaki gave a nervous laugh and Shampoo 
rolled her eyes  at this before she found her 
attention drawn away by a couple walking  past. The 
woman leading the two had an understated beauty 
about her  with her long brown hair and warm tone 
of voice but she wasn&#39;t the  one who had caught 
Shampoo&#39;s attention. Rather, it was the woman&#39;s  
companion whose face was completely covered the 
massive pile of  bags that she was holding that 
intrigued Shampoo so. 

	Intrigued Shampoo because of what exactly the 
woman  carrying the bags was saying. And what was 
she saying? 

	Well, she was saying a long line of very... 
descriptive and  extensive vulgarities in Mandarin. 

	And Shampoo knew of only one person that knew 
of so many  vulgarities and would sound so happy 
while saying them. 

	&quot;Perfume!&quot; shouted Shampoo as she silently 
prayed that she  was right about this. 

	The woman with the bags slowly turned around 
and said in  muffled tones, &quot;Shampoo? Is that you, 
Cousin?&quot; 

	Shampoo formed a wide smile as she watched 
Perfume lower  the bags to reveal her face. She&#39;d 
found Perfume and now they could  help Tatewaki 
rescue his sister from receiving her sentence. 

	If it hadn&#39;t been delivered already. 

	The only real question remaining in Shampoo&#39;s 
mind was this:  Why was Perfume carrying that 
woman&#39;s groceries? 

--- 

	&quot;Nerima,&quot; said Mousse as she read a road sign 
for the first  time in years without having to 
stand millimeters away from it. She  pushed a stray 
strand of her long luxurious black hair behind her 
ear  while she formed a most adorable look of 
contemplation. &quot;Now why  would Shampoo want to come 
here? It doesn&#39;t look all that special.&quot; 

	Mousse was still considering this when she 
turned around to  return to following after Shampoo 
only to find that she was surrounded  by a mob of 
starry eyed guys. 

	&quot;Uhm... hello?&quot; Mousse said in hesitant tones 
which only  served to make her more kawaii. &quot;Can I 
help you?&quot; 

	&quot;Ah! She&#39;s just as kawaii as Akane-chan!&quot; one 
of the guys in  the mob shouted out. 

	&quot;Blasphemer!&quot; another guy shouted. &quot;No one 
can possibly be  as kawaii as Akane-chan!&quot; 

	&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; the first guy replied. &quot;Check her 
out!&quot; 

	There was a slight pause then the second and 
more skeptical  guy said in awe, &quot;No way! You&#39;re 
right, she is as kawaii as our  beloved Akane-
chan!&quot; 

	&quot;Akane-chan?&quot; Mousse echoed. &quot;Who&#39;s Akane-
chan?&quot; 

	&quot;Ah! She doesn&#39;t know Akane-chan!&quot; another 
guy shouted in  tones of utter shock. &quot;She must be 
new here!&quot; 

	&quot;I wonder if she can cook better than Akane-
chan?&quot; 

	&quot;Everyone cooks better than Akane-chan!&quot; 

	&quot;I say we worship her like Akane-chan!&quot; 

	&quot;Yes, worship her!&quot; 

	&quot;What&#39;s your favorite color?!&quot; 

	&quot;And your astrological sign?!&quot; 

	&quot;Don&#39;t forget about her blood type!&quot; 

	The mob&#39;s shouting got louder and louder as 
they continued to  close in on an entirely shocked 
Mousse. 

	&quot;What?&quot; squeaked Mousse as she backed away 
from the mob  very nervously. &quot;What&#39;re you talking 
about?&quot; 

	And that was when the mob descended upon her. 

--- 

	&quot;So you&#39;re Perfume&#39;s Airen,&quot; said Cologne as 
she gave  Kasumi a close inspection with her eyes. 
&quot;That would explain why she  was hauling your 
groceries around for you.&quot; 

	&quot;Yes, it would,&quot; Kasumi said pleasantly. &quot;I 
asked Perfume to  help me with my shopping and she 
was very kind to do so. I take it  that you&#39;re 
Perfume&#39;s Great Grandmother?&quot; 

	The group had all made their way back to the 
Tendo dojo and  were gathered in the sitting room 
discussing current events that  included Perfume&#39;s 
newly formed engagement. 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Cologne said with a nod. &quot;I am 
Cologne. Am I right in  assuming that you were the 
one who managed to stop Perfume from  fulfilling 
her mission here?&quot; 

	&quot;You would,&quot; replied Kasumi. &quot;You see, the 
people that you  sent Perfume to kill are guests of 
my family and it wouldn&#39;t be polite to  allow them 
to be killed.&quot; 

	Quirking an eyebrow, Cologne said, &quot;No. I 
suppose that it  wouldn&#39;t.&quot; Looking to Perfume she 
continued, &quot;You&#39;ve made a most  interesting choice 
in Airen, Perfume.&quot; 

	&quot;Why thank you,&quot; said Kasumi with a smile. 
She looked to  Tatewaki and said, &quot;But you don&#39;t 
look like an Amazon. May I ask  why you&#39;re here?&quot; 

	&quot;Eh? Me?&quot; asked Tatewaki in distracted tones. 
&quot;I am here with  Ryoga-kun to...&quot; He trailed off as 
he looked around the sitting room  and said, 
&quot;Where&#39;s Ryoga-kun?&quot; 

	&quot;I think maybe he get lost again, Tatewaki,&quot; 
said Shampoo as  she wore a weary expression. &quot;We 
not watch him close enough and he  wander away. Is 
that so?&quot; 

	Heaving a deep sigh, Tatewaki hung his head 
and said, &quot;And  just when we were getting so 
close.&quot; He then said strongly, &quot;I best go  and find 
him. I can&#39;t let him wander aimlessly while his 
family waits  here.&quot; 

	Tatewaki had just turned to exit the sitting 
room when he was  stopped by the figures of Soun 
and Genma returning from their usual  afternoon 
trip to the bar. 

	&quot;Saotome-san,&quot; breathed Tatewaki in shock. 

	&quot;Tatewaki,&quot; echoed Genma in equally shocked 
tones. There  was a moment of silence before Genma 
grabbed him by the collar and  asked hurriedly, &quot;Is 
he here?! Is Ryoga here?!&quot; 

	&quot;He was,&quot; stammered Tatewaki through the 
fierce shaking that  Genma gave him. &quot;But he got 
lost...&quot; 

	&quot;Lost?!&quot; Genma roared. He released Tatewaki 
and looked  deflated as he fell to his knees. &quot;Not 
again.&quot; 

	Kneeling next to him, Tatewaki said softly, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry  Saotome-san. I&#39;ll promise to find 
him...&quot; 

	Soun observed this odd scene for a moment, 
before he looked  to Cologne and his eyes went 
wide. &quot;You,&quot; he said in low tones.  &quot;What are you 
doing here?&quot; 

	&quot;I&#39;m looking for the one called Kuno Kodachi 
and her traveling  companions,&quot; said Cologne. &quot;And 
I believe that you might know  something about 
that, Soun?&quot; 

	&quot;Do you mean Ranma and Genma?&quot; Soun blinked. 
&quot;What do  you want with them?&quot; 

	&quot;Ranma?&quot; repeated Cologne as she formed a 
face of interest.  &quot;And who would that be?&quot; 

	Looking utterly confused, Soun said, &quot;He&#39;s 
Genma&#39;s son.  What do you want with him and 
Kodachi?&quot; 

	&quot;Nothing much, Soun,&quot; said Cologne solemnly. 
&quot;We merely  wish to tell your resident couple of 
thieves that they have been  sentenced for death.&quot; 

--- 

	&quot;Ugh, that smell,&quot; muttered Ranma as he 
shuddered. &quot;Remind  me to never seem helpful again, 
Dachi.&quot; 

	&quot;Surely, my dearest,&quot; Kodachi said with a 
smile. 

	The couple were slowly making their way back 
to the Tendo  dojo as school had been let out 
early. Actually, school hadn&#39;t been let  out 
early... they had merely let themselves out. After 
they attempted to  help Hasamato clean up Akane&#39;s 
cooking for a good five minutes both  Ranma and 
Kodachi became all too disgusted with the effort 
and  decided to flee the school. 

	When they had successfully done that, the 
couple began their  way back to the dojo. Which was 
just what they were doing right  now. Well, were 
doing until Ranma abruptly stopped walking causing  
Kodachi to stop also. 

	&quot;Ranma darling?&quot; asked Kodachi in concern. 
&quot;Is something the  matter?&quot; 

	Not replying, Ranma kept his eyes focused 
ahead and  following his gaze Kodachi saw that it 
lead to a boy wearing a huge  backpack that had a 
red bamboo umbrella on the top of it. The boy  
stood alone in the middle of the street with a 
puzzled expression on his  face. Ranma formed look 
of pure happiness as he ran towards the  other boy 
and shouted, &quot;Ryoga!&quot; 

	The boy turned around and upon seeing Ranma a 
huge smile  crossed his features. &quot;Ranma!&quot; the boy 
shouted in return. Instantly he  began running 
towards Ranma and when they met the two enveloped  
in a strong hug. It took them a minute to part but 
when they did they  instantly began exchanging 
pleasantries. 

	&quot;What&#39;re you doing here Ryoga?&quot; began Ranma 
in a rush of  excitement. &quot;I thought you were in 
Switzerland.&quot; 

	&quot;That was last month,&quot; replied Ryoga smiling. 
&quot;I&#39;ve been in  China looking for you.&quot; He paused to 
smile wider as he said, &quot;I&#39;m sure  glad that I 
found you! It seems like it&#39;s been forever!&quot; He 
eyed Ranma  then as he gave him a light punch on 
the shoulder. &quot;You sure have  grown runt.&quot;   
	&quot;Runt?&quot; Ranma scoffed. &quot;Who&#39;re you calling a 
runt you  blockhead? It doesn&#39;t matter that you&#39;re 
two months older than me  now. I&#39;m taller than 
you.&quot; 

	&quot;Whatever,&quot; dismissed Ryoga. &quot;A year can do a 
lot to a  person. So you had a growth spurt. Big 
deal.&quot; 

	&quot;A year,&quot; Ranma shook his head. &quot;I can&#39;t 
believe it&#39;s been that  long. I have a lot of stuff 
to tell you. But first there&#39;s someone here I  want 
you to meet.&quot; He turned towards Kodachi who was 
observing  them from a distance. &quot;Dachi! C&#39;mere!&quot; 
Ranma looked back to Ryoga  and asked, &quot;Is Kuno 
still traveling with you?&quot; 

	&quot;Of course,&quot; said Ryoga in slight 
exasperation. &quot;He&#39;s been  trying to help me find 
you all this time. You already knew that. Why  even 
ask--&quot; Ryoga stopped talking when Kodachi reached 
them and  he said softly, &quot;You&#39;re Tachi&#39;s sister... 
you&#39;re Kodachi.&quot; He looked to  Ranma and asked 
incredulously, &quot;She&#39;s been with you all this time?&quot; 

	Ranma grinned as he gave a nod. &quot;Yup! 
Kodachi&#39;s my  girlfriend, Ryoga. I&#39;ve been helping 
her to find you and Kuno just like  you&#39;ve been 
helping him to find us.&quot; 

	&quot;Ranma darling,&quot; began Kodachi in tones that 
rang of quiet  hope. &quot;Then you mean that this 
is...?&quot; 

	&quot;My brother Ryoga,&quot; Ranma affirmed. &quot;And if 
he&#39;s here then  Kuno must be nearby.&quot; His smile 
deepened as he looked into glowing  violet eyes. 
&quot;We finally found them. Our search is over.&quot; 

	&quot;Ranma darling...&quot; breathed Kodachi loving 
tones. 

	&quot;Dachi...&quot; echoed Ranma in turn. 

	Ryoga watched the couple a moment before he 
decided to  stop them before he got sick. Releasing 
a loud cough Ryoga woke the  pair out of their 
daze. &quot;So,&quot; he began. &quot;How about the two of you 
help  me find the Tendo dojo? I know that&#39;s where 
they went with Perfume.  I was with them until I 
sorta got lost again,&quot; he said the last part  
sheepishly. 

	&quot;Perfume?&quot; asked Ranma and Kodachi. 

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ryoga. &quot;That&#39;s the name of this 
Amazon warrior  they sent to punish Kodachi and 
some other...&quot; As he trailed off Ryoga  gained a 
look of understanding. Wearing a deep frown he 
said,  &quot;Ranma! Did you steal something from their 
village?&quot; 

	Looking wounded, Ranma said, &quot;Me? Would I do 
something  like that?&quot; 

	&quot;Ranma,&quot; growled Ryoga in warning tones. 

	&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Ranma heaved a sigh. &quot;We did 
some business  with them that went bad. That&#39;s 
all.&quot; 

	Ryoga groaned and rubbed his forehead. &quot;I 
thought that  Mother told you to stop doing that 
sort of thing!&quot; 

	&quot;What she doesn&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt her,&quot; said 
Ranma easily.  He gave Ryoga a slap on the back and 
started to walk in the direction  of the Tendo 
dojo. &quot;And I doubt that Mother will get angry. She  
knows all about Pop&#39;s rules of roughing it. We have 
to do and find  everything on our own. That 
includes money for our supplies.&quot; 

	&quot;I guess so...&quot; Ryoga said thoughtfully. &quot;But 
I still don&#39;t think  that Mother will like it.&quot; 

	&quot;Then Mom&#39;ll explain it to her,&quot; said Ranma 
with a shrug.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry so much bro. They 
forgive Pop each time he screws up  so you know 
they&#39;re gonna forgive us.&quot; 

	Ryoga was still mulling over this when they 
entered the  grounds of the Tendo dojo. As the 
removed their shoes the sounds of  loud sobbing met 
their ears. Wearing a wry expression Ranma said,  
&quot;Sounds like Tendo-san is upset.&quot; 

	Making no reply Kodachi walked past Ranma to 
the sitting  room wearing a look of both anxiety 
and hope. Watching this with a  face of concern 
Ranma quickly dashed after his girlfriend while 
Ryoga  trailed behind them slowly. 

	&quot;Tendo,&quot; Ryoga said to himself. &quot;I just know 
I&#39;ve heard that  name somewhere before.&quot; 

--- 

	&quot;Death!&quot; shouted Soun through his tears. 
&quot;What do you mean  they&#39;re sentenced to death?! And 
what do you mean by calling Ranma  and Kodachi a 
couple?! Ranma is supposed to marry one of my 
girls,  it&#39;s been promised!&quot; 

	&quot;Tatewaki,&quot; said Shampoo softly as she moved 
to whisper in  his ear. &quot;What he more upset over? 
Death sentence or fact demon  thieves is a couple? 
Shampoo not know.&quot; 

	&quot;A couple,&quot; seethed Tatewaki who was turning 
a deep shade  of red while he clenched his hands 
into fists. &quot;My sister and that  scoundrel Saotome? 
A couple?! I&#39;ll kill him...&quot; 

	&quot;Eh... never mind,&quot; Shampoo murmured then she 
took a visible  step away from Tatewaki who was 
still seething. 

	Heaving a deep sigh, Cologne said, &quot;For 
heavens sake calm  down Soun. You know me. Do you 
really think that I&#39;d sentence them  both to death 
when I had the chance to gain something from this  
entirely unpleasant situation?&quot; 

	&quot;Gain something?&quot; repeated Genma 
suspiciously. He stood up  and said, &quot;What are you 
up to, old woman?&quot; 

	&quot;Your son stole from my tribe,&quot; Cologne 
stated in cold and  steely tones. &quot;He and Kodachi 
both must make reparations for that. I  think 
pledging themselves to our greater good would do 
just that.  Wouldn&#39;t you think?&quot; 

	&quot;What&#39;re you talking about?&quot; Genma growled. 

	&quot;I&#39;ve always wanted a Saotome on the side of 
the Amazons,&quot;  said Cologne as she formed a slow 
smile. &quot;And when Comb failed to  marry you I was 
disappointed, Genma. But now it seems I&#39;ve been  
presented with a chance to make up for that. Your 
son will pledge  loyalty to myself and my tribe. He 
will become one of us. He will  become an Amazon.&quot; 

	&quot;Really? No one told me about that.&quot; 

	The group all turned to see the figure of 
Ranma standing in the  doorway with Ryoga at his 
side and right in front of them was the wide  eyed 
figure of Kodachi whose eyes were focused on the 
sight of her  older brother. 

	&quot;Tatewaki,&quot; whispered Kodachi. 

	&quot;Kodachi,&quot; echoed Tatewaki. 

	In seconds the two were exchanging a fierce 
hug for an  embrace that had been years in the 
making. When they finally parted  after a few 
minutes, Tatewaki wore a face of utter joy as he 
said, &quot;I&#39;ve  missed you greatly, my sister.&quot; 

	&quot;And I you, my brother,&quot; Kodachi replied 
tearfully. 

	The quiet moment of family reunion shattered 
by the loud shout  of Genma as he cried out, 
&quot;Ryoga!&quot; 

	&quot;Dad!!&quot; shouted Ryoga, whose eyes lit up when 
he saw  Genma. He immediately went running towards 
the older man and  embraced him in a bone crushing 
hug. &quot;I&#39;ve missed you Dad! How  have you been?!&quot; 

	&quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; Genma wheezed. &quot;But I&#39;m having a 
little trouble  breathing here, son.&quot; 

	Giving a nervous laugh, Ryoga released Genma 
from his hold  and rubbed the back of his head. 
&quot;Sorry Dad,&quot; said Ryoga as he  smiled. 

	&quot;It&#39;s okay boy,&quot; said Genma cheerfully. 
&quot;Everything is going to  be okay now that you&#39;re 
here.&quot; 

	&quot;Really?&quot; asked Ryoga in confusion. &quot;How 
come?&quot; 

	&quot;Never mind that,&quot; Cologne interrupted. &quot;We 
have business  with young Ranma here.&quot; She hopped 
closer to Ranma and Kodachi  on her staff and said, 
&quot;You do realize that you&#39;re both under Amazon  
death sentence, do you not?&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah, we realized,&quot; Ranma snorted. &quot;But in 
case you haven&#39;t  noticed your girl hasn&#39;t been 
doing the best job. We&#39;re still alive and  kicking. 
What about that?&quot; 

	&quot;Indeed,&quot; murmured Cologne. &quot;Perfume has 
failed in killing you  both but that hardly matters 
as I&#39;m here to tell her that the death  sentence 
has been revoked.&quot; 

	&quot;Revoked?&quot; Kodachi repeated. 

	&quot;Ah, Kuno-san,&quot; said Cologne as she looked to 
Kodachi.  &quot;You have your brother to thank for that. 
He kindly asked for my  leniency and I have decided 
to give it. But only under some outlined  
conditions of course.&quot; 

	&quot;Of course,&quot; said Ranma as his gaze narrowed. 
He tilted his  head to one side and said, &quot;What do 
you want?&quot; 

	Her eyes gaining a dangerous gleam, Cologne 
said, &quot;I want all  of our tribal treasures back.&quot; 

	There was a slight pause before Ranma gave a 
short  incredulous laugh and said, &quot;You&#39;re kidding! 
Is that all?&quot; 

	&quot;Hardly,&quot; Cologne pronounced dryly. &quot;I also 
want you both to  pledge your complete and utter 
loyalty to myself and my tribe. You  two will 
become my newest apprentices and you will promise 
to never  bring harm to Joketsuzoku again. You will 
fight for us and not against  us.&quot; She paused to 
ask, &quot;What do you say to that?&quot; 

	There was another long pause of utter silence 
as Ranma and  Kodachi exchanged a silent look. 
Together, they both turned back to  Cologne and 
said, &quot;Deal.&quot; 

	Their words were met with a loud crash as
