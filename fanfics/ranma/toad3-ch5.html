<h2>A Night of Fire and  Storm</h2>
<p>The corridor was non-descript, painted an off white  that made it as bland and featureless as a hospital hallway.  The doors leading off of it were un-numbered  and un-marked, but the woman traveling down the hall needed no directions.</p><p>
  She was fairly tall, with a golden hue to her skin  that spoke of long hours in the sun, though she rarely saw daylight, and it  made a vivid contrast to her long white hair.   She was dressed in a form fitting dress of night black silk that matched  the dead black, six pointed stars on her face, and she walked with a purpose,  the spike heeled stilettos she wore impacting the carpet almost hard enough to  penetrate it.  </p><p>
  Hild was not happy.  </p><p>
  The two demons who followed her, one male, one female,  were doing their best to fulfill their roles as escorts and body guards while  trying to avoid Hild’s actual notice.   When Hild was in a bad mood, anything could happen, and neither one of  them really relished non-existence, or any one of Hild’s punishments that could  be worse than death.</p><p>
  It had started with the reports that Mara had been  stricken from Nifelheim’s computer system.   As Mara had been under intense surveillance, this had been a  mystery.  And it had occurred just  moments after Hild had administered a chastisement to the demoness, which had  angered the Goddess of Nifelheim even further.   Subsequent investigation had revealed Mara’s defection, apparently aided  by the Dragon, and her reassignment as a minor goddess under Urd’s  tutelage.  </p><p>
  Needless to say, none of that had improved Hild’s mood  in the slightest.  She had long been  aware of Mara’s infatuation with her daughter; indeed, she had encouraged it to  a degree.  She had tolerated Mara’s  consistent failures solely to use them as a tool to force the demoness to do  her bidding at this time, when Mara’s love for Urd, and her constant  humiliation and shame could be used to drive the demoness, goad her into making  Urd’s test a failure, all so she could finally possess the goddess she so  loved.</p><p>
  And Legend had interfered!</p><p>
  It was time for that overgrown lizard to learn that  one did not cross Hild lightly.</p><p>
  The door at the end of the hallway opened to reveal a  plush room and an impeccably dressed Japanese gentleman.</p><p>
  “Greeting’s Mistress Hild.  It is a pleasure as always.”</p><p>
  “Is she ready?”</p><p>
  “Of course, Mistress.   She was unconscious for the first few days, but has awakened.”</p><p>
  “And her memories?”</p><p>
  “Alas, she is still a blank slate.  She can follow orders, but she has neither  spoken nor shown any signs of reasoning.   She follows orders, but no more.”</p><p>
  Hild grinned nastily, making even the demons  shiver.  “That is something I will  address personally.  Has she been taken  care of?”</p><p>
  “Yes Mistress.   We have groomed her and such.  Her  wounds have healed quickly, and with very little scaring.  As yet, we have not trained her as a servant. </p><p>
  “I am unconcerned with that.  All I need is the body.  Bring her.”</p><p>
  The man bowed and clapped his hands.  A door to the side of the chamber opened and  a young woman entered.  She was naked,  her shapely body showing a flawless pale complexion, and the faintest of scars  on her right shoulder.  Her golden eyes  were slit pupiled, and her ears came to delicate points.  Her hair was mainly white, with streaks of  pink and black, and it highlighted her exotically pretty face.  She knelt before Hild, her eyes showing no  glimmer of thought.</p><p>
  Hild nodded.  “She  shall serve nicely.  For as little time  as you have had her, you have done well.”</p><p>
  “Our doctors are very well trained, Mistress, and the  wounds she came to us with healed amazingly fast.” He hesitated a second.  “As to the <em>method</em> of payment, Mistress, I did have one request.”</p><p>
  Hild’s eyes narrowed.   “Yes?”</p><p>
  “We would be willing to forgo the normal cash payment  in exchange for the genetic material from this subject.  Our laboratories believe we can clone her  within a few years, and she would make an excellent model for a line of sex  slaves.”</p><p>
  Hild raised her eyebrow, then laughed.  “You are welcome to her blood; I have no use  for it as is.”  She reached out and drew  the girl to her feet, her eyes darkening to empty pools of black as she leaned  down to kiss her.  The girl’s body  stiffened as her eyes opened wide in panic, and for a moment they focused on  her tormentors face.  Then they darkened  to a solid crimson as tears of blood began to fall.  A jar appeared in Hild’s hand and she caught  the fall of blood, the smile on her face vicious.  </p><p>
  “You are lucky to be so blessed.  I seldom eat the souls of mortals” she  whispered.  She leaned forward and licked  a drop of blood from the girls face.   “And yours is such a delicious soul.   So full of hate.”</p><p>
  The girl fell to her knees, the blood pouring from her  eyes in a continuous stream, draining away all traces of heat and color from  the girl’s body, leaving even her hair white as newly fallen snow .  The man looked on impassively, waiting till  the jar was nearly full and the tears had ceased to flow.  He picked it up and bowed.  “You are generous, Mistress.  If ever you require our services again,  please call.”</p><p>
  “The Yakuza has ever served me well.” she said,  dismissing him.  She waited for him to go  and lifted the girl to her feet again.   The girl stood limply, listlessly, her colorless eyes utterly vacant of  life and as cold as her skin was to the touch.   Hild reached out her hand, and the male demon hurried forward to place a  small box in it.  Hild brought it forward  and opened it to reveal a large pearl.   She picked it up and smiled grimly.</p><p>
  “Such a pretty, hollow, vessel.  Your soul devoured, your blood drained, your  mind emptied.”  Hild stepped around the  motionless figure.  “You would make such  a lovely decoration in my palace had I no better purpose for you.”  She lifted the pearl, and the girl’s eyes  fixed on it.  Hild laughed.  “Yes, I have a soul for you, and blood.”  She grabbed the girl’s hair and pulled her  head back, lifting the pearl above her mouth and squeezing.  With a sharp crack, the pearl opened, blood  pouring out in a stream to be greedily swallowed by the pale girl.  She drank the flowing stream, color returning  to her limbs as her face grew ecstatic, then a hazy ball of light formed as the  pearl disintegrated.  The glowing orb drifted  down and melted into the girl’s form as she let out a long shuddering breath  and collapsed to the floor.</p><p>
  Hild gave her a few minutes before reaching down to  draw her face up to meet her eyes and she smiled, pleased by what she found  there.  The girl’s irises had changed to  an emerald green instead their original yellow hue. She blinked, and looked  away from Hild’s gaze.</p><p>
  “Do you recall who you were now?”  Hild whispered.</p><p>
  “I-I…”  The girl  stopped, the confusion in her eyes strong, and her voice was an odd mixture, as  if two people were speaking at once.  “I  was once Herb, Prince of the Musk Dynasty.   I am Herb no longer.  Memories  swirl inside me, but Herb’s are distant, and full of rage, fading…  I- I am <em>not</em> Herb.”</p><p>
  “Then who are you?”   Hild asked, an amused lilt in her voice.</p><p>
  The girl closed her eyes for a long moment, and when  she spoke again her voice had shifted a half octave higher, and lost the  peculiar echo.  “I am Clove.”</p><p>
  “Yes.  Long ago,  Xi’an Chi slew you, drowned you in a pool at Jusenkyo.”</p><p>
  The girl nodded, lifting her hands to flex them, long  golden claws springing from their tips.  “You  have brought me back.”</p><p>
  “I have resurrected you in a sense.  I have returned your soul into the lifeless body  of Herb.”</p><p>
  Clove nodded.  “Yes.”  She shuddered.  “I can feel the magics that have been wrought  on this body.  It still remembers being  male.”</p><p>
  “That will fade shortly, as your soul assumes full  control. The body you wear was the last descendant of your blood.  Fortunately, he had fallen into the very  spring in which you had perished.  It is  a pity that he was slain by an Amazon, but the curse of Jusenkyo perished with  his life, and with his flesh already female and so close to your own, it was a  simple matter to make it a perfect match to your soul.  Have no fear, you are exactly as you were on  the day you died.  You are fully yourself  now, in mind and body.”  Hild leaned  forward, her lips caressing Clove’s ear.   “I have returned you to the mortal realm, to live once more the life  that was cut so short, but there is a price, a debt of honor that you now owe.”</p><p>
  Clove nodded.   “I am a princess of the Musk dynasty.   I and my clan will honor your price.”</p><p>
  Hild smiled.  “Your  clan is no more, princess.”  The smile  grew chilly.  “As to the cost? I think  you will find my price a most agreeable one.   One that you might even find… pleasurable.”  She ran a finger along Clove’s shoulder as  she stepped around her.  “I want you to  seduce a girl.  A girl you will find most  delectable.  I want you to seduce her,  sate yourself on her, make her a slave to your passions.  Destroy the ties she has with those who care  for her, tear her free from those who protect her, so that she worships only  you.  And when she does, then you shall  bring her to me, and together, we will slowly cut the life from her body an  inch at a time.”</p><p>
  Clove tilted her head, her face impassive.  “And who is this girl?” she asked, her voice  betraying the slightest signs of anticipation.</p><p>
  “A child made possible by your betrayal and  death.  A child responsible for the fall  of the Musk.”  Hild waved her hand and an  image of the ruins of the Musk   Castle appeared.  “Little more than a week ago, she led the  Amazons on a raid that destroyed your home, Clove, and brought about the  destruction of your Clan.  The last Child  of the Dragon.”</p><p>
  Clove’s eyes were locked onto the ruins, and her face  was grim.  “So, Clan Dragon has finally  defeated us.”  A bitter laugh  escaped.  “I would have made Shi Emperor  of all China,  had he not denied me.  I would have even  happily shared him with Mu.”  She raised  her head.  “Very well, sorceress.  I will meet your price, I will seduce and  enslave this girl, I will make her love me.”   Her eyes lifted to meet Hild’s.   “I ask one boon though.”</p><p>
  Hild nodded, reaching out to caress the girl’s  heartbreakingly beautiful face.  “Above  and beyond your resurrection?  You have  fire indeed, Clove of the Musk.  What is  your desire?”</p><p>
  Clove’s eyes hardened.   “Her final death must be mine.  I  will rip her heart out and as she dies in my arms, I will tell her why I have  killed her, and she will die knowing I have avenged my clan.  And she will know that I, and only I, am the  true Heir of the Dragon.”</p><p>
  Hild threw back her head and laughed.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“Ranma is certain he no wish Shan Pu be catgirl?” Shan  Pu asked as she curled against Ranma’s side.   “Shan Pu is happy Ranma not afraid of Shan Kitty anymore, but she not  mind if want be catgirl.”  </p><p>
  Ranma smiled at the Chinese girl stretched out on the  bed next to her while they shared the textbook their homework was from.  Shan Pu had, reluctantly, kept her clothes on  when they had retired to Akane’s room after dinner to do the homework they’d  put off for sex earlier.  Rather, she’d  stayed in her cheongsam, but nothing else, as the high riding skirt revealed  her shapely derriere.  Ranma pulled her  eyes back to the book.   “Truth to tell,  Shan-chan.  I don’t know what I’d  prefer.”</p><p>
  Akane looked over from her desk.  “I happen to like her as a cat.”</p><p>
  Ranma nodded, turning the page of her textbook as Shan  Pu indicated she’d finished reading the page.   “I know.  I just can’t decide if  I’d feel better if Shan wasn’t so… helpless when she’s transformed.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu stopped reading and looked up at Ranma.  “Shan Pu have claws.”</p><p>
  Ranma reached over and scratched the back of Shan Pu’s  head.  “I know.  But watching you, being held by Kodachi that  way.  I don’t ever want to feel that  afraid that someone I like might be hurt.”   She sighed.  “I know you’re a  warrior Shan-chan, and I truly am not trying to insult you.  I – I…”   She stopped and closed her eyes.   “I failed to save one of your sisters when she was helpless as a  rabbit.  All I could see when Kodachi had  you was the rabbit I wasn’t fast enough to save.  I won’t ask you to be a catgirl against  Akane’s wishes, or your own wishes, but I can’t promise I won’t do everything  to protect you when you’re a cat.  If you  take that as an insult, I’m sorry.  I  don’t mean it as one.”</p><p>
  Akane raised her eyebrow.  “Kami, but you can be a downer  sometimes.”  She stretched, the short top  she was wearing teasingly revealing a hint of her breasts.  “But I can see your point.  Cuddly as Shan-kitty is, you’re right.”  She looked over at the curvaceous  Amazon.  “I’d have gone ballistic seeing  you helpless too.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu shrugged.   “Shan Pu not insulted.  Know kitty  form not very good fighter.  Not matter  in village.  No-one have so little honor  would attack Shan Pu with water.”  She  smiled.  “Shan Pu decide.  Ranma no should have fear, Akane no should  have fear.”  She bounced up from the bed  and kissed Akane on the cheek.   “Shan-Kitty will still like get scratch between ears.  And being petted.  Hope Akane will forgive Shan Pu for not be  China anymore.”</p><p>
  Akane blinked.   “You’re going to do it?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu nodded.   “Grandmother say curse will mix like Akane.  Shan Pu just need pour over self.”</p><p>
  “You don’t have to do this if you don’t want too Shan  Pu.”  Ranma said.  “I can’t ask you to do this just for my  fears.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu leaned over and gave Ranma a kiss too.  “You no decide, Ai Ren.  Shan Pu decide for self.  Will not find self in shameful situation  again.”  She straightened and pulled her  skirt straight.  “Shan Pu go get  water.  Will Ai Rens come to furo with  Shan Pu?”</p><p>
  Ranma closed the textbook.  “You don’t have to do this, really.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu put her hands on her hips and gave her a stern  glance.  “You no make Shan Pu do  anything.  Shan Pu do to self.  Should have done long ago.  Shan-kitty form too big weakness for Amazon  Champion.”  She waited till the red-head  had nodded.  “Good.  No more argue.”</p><p>
  Akane sighed.   “But I like you being a cat.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu stepped up to Akane and held her head to her  stomach.  “Shan Pu know.  But Akane still be able to have Shan-Kitty  girl.  And no have be cat to purr.”  She demonstrated with a deep thrumming that  sounded exactly like her purr as a cat.</p><p>
  Akane sighed happily with the hug.  “Alright.   If you’re sure this is what you want.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu nodded.   “Meet in furo.”  She turned and  stopped at the edge of the door.  “Shan  Pu have thought.”  She tilted her hips  and lifted her skirt to show off her bare rear.   “Shan Kitty will have tail.  Make  hard to keep skirt down, no?”  She  giggled as she vanished through the door.</p><p>
  “She doesn’t have to do this.”  Ranma said softly.</p><p>
  “No, but our Fiancée is ever so stubborn.  She’s made up her mind.”</p><p>
  “I know.”  The  red-head sighed.  “Gods.  She really does everything to try and win our  love, no matter what it might mean to her personally.  Just like Zhu Shu.”  She sat back and let her head fall backwards  to stare at the ceiling.  “Argh.  It’s no wonder they’re Blood-Sisters.”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Zhu Shu was sitting on the edge of the roof outside  the window to the room she shared with Shan Pu, looking up at the moon and  feeling the link in her mind to Ying-Ying.   It had definitely grown stronger since her dream meeting with her first  love.  She could almost feel like  Ying-Ying was just inside the room instead of…</p><p>
  <em>Does being a spirit guardian really  qualify as being dead?  </em></p><p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;No.  More like being merged into your head,  love.&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  Zhu Shu giggled at the thought, knowing at last her  love really was speaking to her.</p><p>
  Shan Pu’s entry into the room distracted her from her  musings.  She smiled over her shoulder to  her Blood-Sister.  “So, did you actually  get <em>any</em> homework done?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu stuck her tongue out.  “Yes, we did.   It’s not done yet - and I’m eager for loveplay, and teasing my fiancée’s  mercilessly - but we <em>are</em> doing our  homework.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu giggled.   “So why are you back over here?”</p><p>
  “I have made my decision.  Ranma made a really good point.”</p><p>
  “Oh?  So you’re  going half and half?”</p><p>
  “Yes.”  Shan Pu  pulled the small cask out of her closet and sat down on the chair.  “He told me about a woman he could not save,  one of my sisters who died as a rabbit during the attack on the village.  He reminded me of how vulnerable I am as a  kitten.  I could have been of far more  use then had I been a catgirl instead of just a cat.”  </p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “True.  But at least you didn’t  become a cabbit.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu stuck out her tongue as she tapped the  cask.  “This made my sisters able to be  warriors again, and it will remove the fear my Ai Ren’s share as to my well  being when I am transformed.  As much as  I do not wish to deprive Akane of my kitten self, it is too much of a  weakness.  My Amazon pride will not  accept my Ai Ren’s continuing to be afraid just because of feline vanity.  Being a kitten can be enjoyable, and now that  Ranma seems to be able to accept me as a cat,   well…”  she shook her head.  “No.   I’m the Amazon’s Champion, and I’ve allowed myself for too long to be  helpless when I get wet.  I should have  doused myself when the rest of the village did.   Being a kitten was fine when I was young, but I’m not thirteen  anymore.  I’m going to be a wife…”  She looked towards Akane’s room with a  blissful smile.  “And my Ai Ren’s deserve  to have me at least <em>mostly</em> human.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “I think you’re rushing into this too fast,  Shan Pu.  It’s only been two days since  Ranma rescued you-”</p><p>
  “That’s just it, Zhu Shu.  Ranma shouldn’t have had to rescue me!  I could have beaten Kodachi had I not become  a kitten.  As wonderful as the outcome  was, he shouldn’t have been forced to confront such a horrible memory because  of me.”  Shan Pu said as she flounced on  the futon.  “I’m learning that as good as  my fiancées are as martial artists, they are not truly warriors as we Amazons  have always been.  They have not been  tested on a field of blood.”</p><p>
  “No.  Neither of  them have killed.  They’ve had the luxury  of not having had to have made that choice.   That’s one thing I cannot agree with you on, Sister.  The Amazons are far too ready to take life.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu raised an eyebrow.  “To quote Akane, you are being a real downer,  Sister.  I’m in way too good a mood to  want to debate Amazon customs right now.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sighed.   “Sorry.  I don’t know why that  came out so confrontationally.  Don’t  mind me.  Go to your beloveds and have  some fun.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu rolled her eyes and stuck out her tongue  again.  “I plan to.”  She hopped up and tucked the cask under her  arm.  “I’ve had to listen to you and Rei,  not to mention you and your dream lover.   I plan to have an enjoyable bath with my loves.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu chuckled.   “Only fair, Sister dear.  Only  fair.”</p><p>
  She turned back to look at the moon and reach for  Ying-Ying again, wondering where her momentary vehemence had come from.  Shan Pu hadn’t been complaining that Ranma  and Akane weren’t trained to kill first, she’d just been upset that Ranma had  been forced to deal with death because of her.   She hadn’t deserved to be snapped at.</p><p>
  A shiver ran down her spine as she looked out into the  night, a vague feeling of unease creeping up on her.</p><p>
  <em>Something’s not right.  Something…</em></p><p>
  The night offered no clues, but Zhu Shu knew something  was out there.  Something just on the  edge of familiarity…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Clove examined herself in the mirror and smiled.  Hild had indeed given her an excellent body,  one that not only flowed with the blood of her clan, but carried the blood of  her mother as well.  In one way only was  her new body different from her original one – Herb had never learned to use  the magical abilities he had inherited.   It had taken her several hours to tame the undisciplined mystical  energies, the youki that surged within her.   But now, she had recovered fully all that she had once lost.</p><p>
  She closed her eyes and reached out with her senses,  feeling the coursing rivers of power flowing within her, and with a thought,  she drew on them, reveling in the sensations she had once despaired of ever  feeling again.  Xi’an Chi had ripped her  ability to sense the flows out of her mind before he had raped her and drowned  her, had violated her mind as casually as he had violated her body.  She had died, trapped within her body and  unable to even block him from her mind as he savored her final memories and  regrets…</p><p>
  She wobbled unsteadily as the memory robbed her of  strength, but pushed it aside as she cradled her rage, let it build inside her  again until she was laughing.</p><p>
  This new body  was young, in excellent physical condition, and carried the ties which only a  daughter of Lin Tzu could claim.  She  could feel the Blood of the Dragon singing in her veins as she laughed.</p><p>
  The room around her faded as she rose through the  ceiling and out into the night, the powers within her seeking their true form,  and she coalesced in the air above the skyscraper, her midnight wings sweeping  downwards as she settled on the roof.  It  had been too long, imprisoned in the timeless void of a trapped soul, since she  had last been a dragon.  She laughed  again as the air crackled and swirled, the power she flung to the winds drawing  the sky into a vortex of storm.   Lightning struck the top of the radio tower that shared the roof with  her, and she roared into the forming storm with the thunder.</p><p>
  <em>Blood of the Dragon, Daughter of the  Dragon, Child of Musk, I am REBORN!  </em>She thought, as the rapidly forming clouds broke and  rain began to cascade across the city.  But  the joy was tempered by a natural suspicion.  <em>Yet all she has asked is a  vengeance I would have sought anyway.   This is too simple.  The Queen of  Demons would not ask so little for such a boon.   I must be cautious.</em></p><p>
  Her eyes turned towards a distant part of the city, an  outlying residential district were she could feel a distinct tug, a call  almost.  The storm flung an arm of cloud  out towards the huddled houses, its winds and rain growing ever stronger as she  played with the vortex of energies around her, renewing her ties to the ebb and  flow of the magical forces of the Earth.  <em>The brat must be that way, s</em>he  thought as her eyes sought out the shadows and lights of that far off locale. <em> I am  almost tempted to just go and burn her to ashes, </em>she thought, tongues of  flame curling around her toothy muzzle as she licked her lips.  <em>But  such a death would be too quick.  Shi  Wang abandoned me to Xi’an Chi, left me for the wizard to do with as he  wished.  I cannot allow his seed to die a  less shameful death.  She must suffer as  I did, feel the horror of knowing her love was wasted, know who’s crimes she is  paying for.</em></p><p>
  She shifted back to her human form as she raised her  face to the heavens.  “I will make her  pay for what you did to me, Shi!  I will  make her curse the day you turned your back on me!”  She screamed into the howling winds, hoping  that he would somehow hear her in the afterlife, and know despair.  <em>But I  must see her first.  I must know this  girl you have spawned.  I will make this  false Child of the Dragon face the true.   Then I shall wrap her around my finger as a toy.  I will make her suffer the vengeance you  escaped, Shi, and then I will go and avenge myself on Xi’an Chi.</em></p><p>
  The wind whipped her white hair as she stood on the  edge and turned her eyes toward that far away call, then she stepped over the  edge and rode away on the storm.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Thunder crashed without warning against the windows of  the room where Ke Lun was training her nieces Ling-Ling and Lung-Lung,  startling her.  She stood and looked out  at the rapidly growing storm and grimaced.   This was no natural weather.   Something powerful rode the winds, something just on the edge of  familiarity.   She bade the twins to  their room and made her way to the roof.</p><p>
  She knew what created the storm, she knew she did, but  the memory would not come.  Only a sense  that a new danger had appeared, or perhaps an old danger had reappeared.  She ignored the rain as it began to fall, the  shift in form causing only a seconds lapse in her concentration as she adjusted  her footing to deal with the increased height, and searched the sky for some  clue.</p><p>
  <em>You’re getting forgetful, old crone,</em> she told herself.  <em>You </em>know<em> what this is.  Think!</em></p><p>
  Then a sound filtered down through the howl of the  wind and the spatter of the rain, and a chill ran down her spine.  A sound she had not heard in centuries.</p><p>
  From far overhead came the creak of vast leathery  wings as a shadow slid through the storm.</p><p>
  Her hand found her cell phone and the speed dial was  ringing by the time she had it to her ear.   She kept her eyes locked to the clouds as she waited impatiently for an  answer.</p><p>
  Finally, she got it.   Lo Shen’s voice came from the speaker, tinny and distant.  “Hello?”</p><p>
  “I need you here.”   Ke Lun said tersely.  “There’s a  dragon over Nerima.”</p><p>
  She didn’t wait for an answer as she leapt off the  roof into the night.  A dragon <em>could</em> mean nothing, but so few remained  these days, and this one followed the pattern of one on the hunt, and in  Nerima, there could only be <em>one</em> thing  a dragon hunted.  </p><p>
  The scent of another dragon…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Shan Pu opened her eyes and blinked away the  water.  The first thing she focused on  was Akane’s face, and the concerned look it bore.  </p><p>
  “Ai Ren?  Is  there problem, nyah?”  she asked, and  startled herself with the fact  that she  was wet, and it hadn’t come out entirely a meow.   <em>Silly,  that was the whole point!</em>  She  reminded herself as Akane shook her head.  </p><p>
  “No, Shan-chan.   No problem, just hoping that there weren’t any unforeseen side effects.”</p><p>
  “She looks pretty okay to me,” Ranma chimed in from  the tub’s edge.  “And I’ll say she has a  nice tail if she promises me she won’t hit me for it.”</p><p>
  Akane giggled as Shan rolled her eyes.  Then finally, Shan took a deep breath as she  nerved herself to turn and look at her new self in the mirror.</p><p>
  “Oh… myah…” she said finally.</p><p>
  Akane smiled as Shan Pu examined the large cat ears  poking up in front of her odango, and the long pink tail tipped with purple  that swayed behind her.  “You look really  cute, Shan-kitty.  Very sexy.  And that kittenish accent is adorable.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu nodded,   “Shan Pu not seem able to help, myah.   Feel funny talk at all, nyah, teeth feel long and sharp.”  She looked at her fingers, and mewed happily  at the inch long claws they sported.   “And Shan-kitty no longer be defenseless when wet, nyah!”</p><p>
  Ranma shook her head.   “Not with those things.  But I’m a  little nervous letting you play with <em>me</em> with them either.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu frowned, then gave another happy mew as her  claws retracted to something more human length.   “There.  Now Shan Pu not hurt Ai  Ren’s, myah.”</p><p>
  Akane stepped behind her and encircled her with her  arms, looking over Shan Pu’s shoulder into the mirror to meet her eyes.  “Don’t mind her.  Ranma’s being silly.  I like it.   I still get my Shan-kitty, but I get a full time fiancée too.   A very beautiful one at that.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu’s eyes caught a glitter in Akane’s eyes and  she blinked confusedly.  “Why Ai Ren look  at Shan-kitty with tears in eyes, nyah?”</p><p>
  Akane laughed, “Because.  Three times in my life, I’ve been a fool.  And all within a few months.”  She nuzzled her head into Shan Pu’s  hair.  “I was a fool when Ranma first  came, because I refused to admit to myself he was the man I know him to be now,  and I was a fool with Zhu Shu, fighting my own desires and using her badly in  an effort to hide my hurt from myself, and now, I have been a fool for being  reserved about my love for you, Shan Pu.”</p><p>
  Ranma tilted her head but didn’t say anything as Akane  continued.</p><p>
  “What I’m trying to say is I think I do love you, and  I think Ranma does too, in our own ways.   I’ve never been good at recognizing my own feelings, Shan Pu, and  Ranma’s worse, but I know without a shadow of a doubt you love me, and that  means more to me than I can say.  I  didn’t want to believe that someone who barely knew me could really love me,  but every action you’ve taken has showed me how wrong I was.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu reached up to stroke Akane’s hair.  “Shan Pu can not but love Ai Ren’s, myah.  You have conquered Shan Pu’s heart as you  have conquered her.”</p><p>
  Akane nodded.   “I know that, now.  I’m sorry it  took so long.  That day in the dojo…  well…  I’m sorry I ran away.  And all I can say is that I was confused, and  I’m sorry I hurt you.”</p><p>
  “Shan Pu forgive Akane.  Never blamed Ai Ren, myah.  Shan Pu was fool that day.”</p><p>
  Ranma cleared her throat.  “Before we get into a mutual ‘no, it was my  fault’ contest, can I say something?”</p><p>
  They both looked at her.</p><p>
  “Akane, I know I ain’t good about saying I love you,  but like you said, you know that I’d give my life for you, and well… Shan Pu,  I’m sorry I freaked out about you in cat form, and I still say this wasn’t  necessary, but like Akane, I know you did it because you love us both, and  never wanted us to have to worry about you being hurt in cursed form.  So, I guess, for me, I have to say I care a  lot about you too, and I’m glad you’re our fiancée.”  She gave a wry grin.  “And the next time we go back to China, I’m  gonna kick that Guide’s butt for telling all those stories about how you’d flay  my skin off and eat it in front of me and such.   You’re really a sweet girl, and I’m going to try and deserve all that  love you have for me.”  She scratched her  head.  “I ain’t saying I’m going to be  good at it, Akane says I’m terrible at showing my emotions and such, and so  does Zhu Shu, but–”</p><p>
  Shan Pu stopped her with a kiss.  “Shan Pu understand, myah.”  </p><p>
  For a long second, there was only the sound of the  raindrops outside, then the tender moment was shattered as a loud impact shook  the house.  There was a shrill scream  from upstairs followed by a loud roar and the sound of the roof being ripped  asunder.</p><p>
  Without even bothering for her clothes, Shan Pu joined  her fiancées dash for the door.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The change in air pressure was all the warning Zhu Shu  had as the dragon dived.  She had been watching  the storm uneasily,  the odd flows and  patterns giving her shivers as she had sought to figure out why it had come,  and too late, she had tried to dive out the window as the ceiling had crashed  inward from the dragon’s attack.  She  screamed as she found herself lifted from the debris by the huge claw and  squirmed as she tried to escape.  Then  the dragon lifted her into the rain, and she transformed.  The dragon roared in fury as she forced the  claw open and shot for open air.  It  snatched for her, then spread huge wings as it launched itself after her.</p><p>
  But not before a furious cat girl sprang for its back  and latched onto one of the barbs running along its spine.  The dragon roared again in pain as Shan Pu  drove her bon buri into its side with enough force to snap the weapon’s handle,  and its angry writhing threw the Amazon off.   She spun in the air, hissing in anger, trying to land on her feet, then  found herself caught by a strong pair of arms as she and Ranma landed on a roof  safely.  </p><p>
  Zhu Shu had twisted and drawn her swords, catching the  dragon off guard with the chi blast.  It  roared and lunged for her, its snapping jaws nearly catching her tail.  She tried to swing around behind it, but the  serpentine form curled too quickly, and she found herself caught in a wave of  fire from its jaws.  </p><p>
  With a cry of pure rage, Akane descended in a glowing  ball of gold, her ribbons lashing out with blinding speed to slash at the  dragon’s wings with a spray of blood, the delicate membranes unable to stand  against the razor like strips of cloth.   As it screamed in rage, Zhu Shu emerged from the fire ball singed and  clothingless, but seemingly unhurt, though the now steaming rain had forced her  to change back to her human form.  Akane  caught her as she started to fall.  With  a crash the dragon landed, crushing a car as it lashed out with its wings to  batter the two girls from the air.  Zhu  Shu managed to stop her uncontrolled flight before smashing into a wall, coming  to a stop under the overhang of a shop, but Akane bounced through a roof top,  her chi shield shattering the tiles like glass.</p><p>
  Then a red glowing blur smashed into the dragon’s side  and knocked it over, the sound of Ranma’s fast flying fists a staccato beat  against the dragon’s ebony scales as it screamed in pain.  She moved like the wind, but a flailing tail  caught her, and sent her crashing into the charging Shan Pu.  She and the Amazon went rolling.</p><p>
  In the momentary pause as the quintet tried to  recover, the dragon spoke a few words in a tongue none of them understood, and  they found themselves caught motionless, held fast by unseen forces.  Shan Pu howled in frustration and anger, but  it did no good.  </p><p>
  With a chuckle, the dragon rose, a glow about it  visibly healing the damage they had done.   With an assured glance at the fighters, it moved towards Zhu Shu, the  massive serpentine form shaking the ground as it reached for the frozen girl.</p><p>
  Then, Zhu Shu blinked as the dragon’s eyes focused on  her and she swore she saw surprise on the scaly face.  For several long seconds, she and the  enormous black dragon stared at each other, and she wondered why it hesitated.</p><p>
  Then it spoke.</p><p>
  “Mu?”</p><p>
  The second passed as a massive catlike form landed on  the dragon’s back, twelve inch canines skittering along the dragon’s scales as  the smilodon growled in fury.  The dragon  whirled, tossing Tao-Ching aside, unleashing a stream of fire at the great cat  that he barely dodged.  Zhu Shu wondered  where Tao-Ching had come from, but only for a second, as a bunny eared Ke Lun  launched herself off a roof top to smack the dragon in the back of the head  with her stick.  </p><p>
  The dragon shrugged off the blow and once again spoke  the words that had frozen the others, catching the smilodon and Ke Lun in the  same snares of energy, but before it could attack the helpless warriors,  something caught its attention, and it looked off into the distance.</p><p>
  A growl of frustration came from its muzzle, then it  vanished in a swirl of shadows, and the invisible bands vanished.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu couldn’t catch herself in time and fell to the  ground with a thump as the others began to run towards her.  She righted herself and dusted herself off,  answering, “Zhu Shu okay!” to the babble of questions.  Then Ke Lun made everyone hush.</p><p>
  “Are you all right, Great Grand-Daughter?”</p><p>
  “Yes.  Zhu Shu a  little bruised, and annoyed that lose dress, but Zhu Shu okay.  How everybody?”</p><p>
  Akane brushed a few chunks of tile out of her  hair.  “We’ve been better.  Was that really a dragon?”</p><p>
  “No.”  Another  voice answered, and the crowd looked up to see Lo Shen stepping out of an  alleyway.  “She was like Zhu Shu, part  dragon, but a magic user as well.  I was  too late to ascertain how powerful she was, but she is formidable.”</p><p>
  “A Black Dragon Mage?”   Ke Lun sighed.  “That is what I  was afraid of.  You remember how  dangerous the last we fought was.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen nodded.   “Clove was my superior then.  I  have learned much in the centuries since.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked.   “Clove?  Clove of Musk?”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “Yes.  The same Clove whose form  you used to bear before your curse mutated.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shivered.   “This dragon.  When she get good  look at Zhu Shu, she seem recognize.  She  call Zhu Shu Mu…”</p><p>
  Ke Lun and Lo Shen looked at each other.  “This is not good.”  Lo Shen said.   “I know of no spell to bring back one so long dead, but there are those  beyond me who may.  And if this is Clove,  she will be seeking vengeance for the fall of the Musk.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “I agree.”  She sighed.  “But we don’t have the warriors to spare to  guard the Heir around the clock.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu stepped forward.  “Great Grandmother, Shan Pu is Blood Sister,  myah!  Is her place to guard Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  “And ours,” Ranma said, with a nod from Akane.</p><p>
  Ke Lun held up her hand to prevent anyone else from  speaking.  “I know you all want to help,  but you must not forget you have other duties.   And before you offer too, I must refuse you, Tao-Ching.  I appreciate your aid, but brute strength  will not help here.  Nor will you be able  to watch Zhu Shu at all times.  You are  too old for school.”  </p><p>
  The cat grumbled but nodded.  </p><p>
  Ke Lun turned to Ranma, Shan Pu, and Akane, noting not  only Shan Pu’s changed form, but the fact that Ranma was standing next to the  smilodon without seeming to notice it. </p><p>
  “As for you three, I accept your offers, since you  would disregard an order to leave this to your elders anyway.  You are all in Zhu Shu’s school, and I think  it will be good for all of you to keep an eye on her.  But you will do so under my command.  Perhaps I can give you jobs as waitresses at  the restaurant’s grand opening tomorrow, it’s almost across the street from Zhu  Shu’s job.”  She turned to Zhu Shu.  “I know you’re not too happy about this, but  we have to keep close.  I swear, I will  do my best to be as unobtrusive as I can, but your safety overrides all else.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu hung her head and nodded.</p><p>
  Lo Shen placed a hand on her shoulder.  “I am sorry that this must be, child.  We do what we must, and no more.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu stepped forward with a shirt retrieved from a  smashed in storefront, and draped it around Zhu Shu.  “We are warriors, Sister.  It is our job to defend you, nyah,” she said  softly in Mandarin.  “And we love you,  mew.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded sadly.   “Zhu Shu know.  But never wish to  be anything but self.  Zhu Shu not  Empress.”</p><p>
  “That doesn’t matter to us, Zhu Shu.”  Akane said.   “We don’t care about whether you’re the heir.  You’re our friend.  We’ll never stand by and watch someone  threaten you and not take action.”</p><p>
  “Yeah.”  Ranma  nodded, then looked at Ke Lun.  “But do  we have to be <em>waitresses?</em>  Can’t you undo this stupid thing that’s  keeping me a girl?”</p><p>
  Ke Lun shook her head.   “I don’t think you’ve learned your lesson yet, ‘Grand-Daughter’.”</p><p>
  “And that has no bearing on the issue at hand.”  Lo Shen said.   She looked over her shoulder at the noise of Soun’s and Genma’s approach.  “For now, I think we should count our  blessings that this fight was mostly in the street, and that only a couple of  shops were destroyed.  I can make things  appear to be storm damage, but the sooner you get home, the better.  The police will be responding to the alarms,  and you shouldn’t be here to be asked awkward questions. </p><p>
  “No, there’s going to be enough of those from  Dad.”  Akane muttered.  “The roof to Zhu Shu’s room is missing.”</p><p>
  “I’ll be along to fix that directly.” Lo Shen  replied.  “Now go!”</p><p>
  The group dispersed, leaving Lo Shen and Ke Lun alone  in the street.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Clove watched the group disperse from the safety of  the shadows and growled in anger.  The  two women left in the street may have sprouted rabbit ears since she had died,  but they were otherwise unchanged.  <em>Ke Lun and Lo Shen!</em></p><p>
  She cursed under her breath.  Those two had been major thorns in her side  when she had sought Shi’s hand.  Ke Lun’s  spite had poisoned Shi’s heart against her, and kept him from ever seeing the  truth of her feelings for the young weapon’s master.  Lo Shen had been her rival in magic, usurping  her place as their teacher’s favorite.   Both were high on her list of people she owed payback too.  The fact that both of them sought to protect  her quarry was a complication, though.   One she felt Hild should have warned her of.  This would require preparation.</p><p>
  The feeling of another aura approaching caught her  attention.  She shifted her focus on the  newcomer, and smiled.  Concern for her  prey was strong in this one’s mind, yet she fought against it.  She watched the girl peek carefully around a  corner, and stop when she spied the two women who were quickly rearranging the  wreckage.  Reluctance to be seen warred  with the suppressed concern, and won easily.   The Chinese sorceress smiled as the girl decided to leave before anyone  saw her, and as she turned, Clove struck.</p>
<p>* * * * </p>
<p>Ke Lun’s ears twitched at the sound of a gasp, and a  body falling, and she looked up from the shop front.  Her staff reappeared in her hand as she waved  Lo Shen to silence.  The Lore Master  nodded, small sparkles forming around her hand as Ke Lun edged up the corner  from which the sound had come.</p><p>
  Then she looked around the corner and sighed.  Lo Shen joined her in looking down at the  unconscious form of Ukyo.</p><p>
  “Do you know this girl?” the Lore Master asked.</p><p>
  Ke Lun nodded.   “Yes.  Our Empress’s hearts-mate,  or one of them anyway.  Her name is  Ukyo.  Looks like she came to investigate  the danger to Zhu Shu and arrived too late to help, but not too late to get  stuck by a loose piece of debris.”  She  brushed the hair away from a nasty bruised cut on the young girl’s scalp,  picking a few scraps of brick out of the cut.   “She’s going to need to be carried back to her bed.”</p><p>
  “Let me look at her cut before you go.”  </p><p>
  Ke Lun picked the unconscious girl up as Lo Shen held  her sparkling hands over the cut and concentrated.  As her hands moved away, the cut had already  become less puffy and bruised.   “There.  I can finish up here, and  at the Tendo’s.  Take her home.  The last thing we need is our Empress  distraught over her love.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun sighed.   “True.  She’s upset enough that  this girl is unwilling to accept what her heart tells her is there because they  are both girls.  I’ve not yet decided  what to do about this silliness.”</p><p>
  “Children will be children, Ke Lun.  Her heart will not let her resist long.  Let it be.   We must concentrate on finding the <em>man</em> who our Empress can be heart’s mate with.   And on keeping Zhu Shu safe from tonight’s attacker.  You know she’s not going to attack as a  dragon again, not if it really <em>is</em> Clove.  She can only hold so many with  that spell.  She might be able to hold  Shan Pu’s Fiancée’s, but not all of us at once.   She’ll try some other, less obvious tactic.”  Lo Shen said quietly.  “I fear they will not be enough.”</p><p>
  “I know.  But  it’s the best we have to work with.”  Ke  Lun replied.</p><p>
  “May the gods smile on us.” </p>
