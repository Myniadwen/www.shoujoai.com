<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 11 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/wildhorse-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>It was a subdued group that gathered at the Tendo home the following 
day. The Amazon&#39;s had arrived, sans Mousse; because they&#39;d had to subdue 
him due to his anger that Ranma had hurt Shampoo. Ukyo arrived a few 
minutes later in the company of Akane and Nabiki. They had stopped by 
her shop on the way home because Ukyo volunteered to supply dinner.

Akane had been unusually quiet ever since they had released her the 
night before and this morning when she arrived at school, she had been 
unusually vicious in dealing with Kuno. Reports Nabiki received 
indicated that there was a good possibility that the Kuno line would now 
only extend through Kodachi. The mercenary Tendo was glad she had Kuno&#39;s 
pattern of sexual harassment and assault well-documented including the 
early attempts that had been made to rein the delusional idiot in. They 
would certainly come in handy if any charges were pressed against her 
family.

Likewise, Ukyo was also pensive as to what the future might hold. For so 
long, her goals had centered around the pigtailed martial artist, first 
for vengeance and then for marriage. Now she was facing the fact that he 
may never be coming back from the world he was currently trapped in and 
even if he did, he might very well be lost to her anyway.

Genma and Soun also remained subdued. Genma by Nodoka&#39;s presence, Soun 
by the realization that he had really mucked things up with his 
daughters. Genma had only lamented about how dishonorable and worthless 
Ranma was once. Nodoka pointed out that if that were true then he had 
failed in the terms of the contract and should prepare himself. The 
Panda-man retracted his words very quickly after that and limited his 
laments to when Nodoka was out of earshot.

Of everyone, only Kasumi and Nabiki seemed eager to watch the tapes with 
something other than grim determination to see things through. Both were 
happy that Ranma seemed to be thriving away from the petty, daily 
pressure that was applied to him here. Nabiki&#39;s happiness was tempered 
by the knowledge of how the original story ended. She hoped Ranma&#39;s 
incredible ability to pull off the win in spite of the odds against him 
shined through in this case as well.

Cologne, as always, found Ranma&#39;s exploits entertaining. She was old and 
wise enough not to begrudge Ranma his involvement with the two girls; 
after all, he had no idea if he would return to this world or not, but 
she hated seeing Shampoo heartbroken.

For her part, Nodoka also had mixed feelings. While fascinated with the 
adventure her son was involved in, she was getting a very candid look 
into the real Ranma behind the mask he wore to make those around him 
here happy. Nabiki had bluntly told her the previous night that what she 
considered manly was anathema to Ranma. The middle Tendo told her that 
Ranma was the type of boy that would never engage in casual sex, nor 
would he engage in any immoral acts like peeping on girls.

Nabiki went on to say that, while he did tend to stretch his honor code 
to the breaking point at times, especially in pursuit of a cure to his 
curse, he always tried to do the right thing no matter the personal cost 
to himself. The girl assured her that even if Ranma was a bit uncultured 
and ill-spoken, he was certainly the most desired male of all among the 
girls in the area.

Thus Nodoka was forced to not only consider how her son&#39;s curse, and 
apparent acceptance of it, fit in with the terms of the contract, but 
also that her values might not be shared by the world at large. Nabiki 
had been adamant that the type of man she wished for Ranma to be would 
be shunned as a deviant by girls of his generation.

It was with these thoughts that the gathered group began watching the 
fourth tape in the Neon Genesis Evangelion 1/2 series.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;I&#39;m home,&quot; Ranma called out as he walked in the door.

Rei appeared in the hallway. Ranma gulped as she walked towards him. She 
was wearing a thin, sky-blue, silk chemise that clung to her lithe body, 
and a pair of white panties. While it wasn&#39;t that uncommon for Rei to 
walk around naked, particularly when he was in the furo, this was a 
whole other concept. This was way more...something that Ranma didn&#39;t 
really want to think about.

Rei walked right up to Ranma and put her arms around his torso, burying 
her face in his chest. Ranma&#39;s arms encircled her as well and they stood 
there for several long moments before he noticed the way that Rei clung 
to him almost desperately.

&quot;You okay, Rei-chan?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;I do not like being alone,&quot; Rei stated as she clung tighter.

Ranma gave her a reassuring squeeze.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m here,&quot; Ranma said soothingly. &quot;Do you wanna hear about 
how things went?&quot;

She nodded against his chest but didn&#39;t release him. Ranma smiled and 
scooped her up bridal fashion, causing her to make a noise that sounded 
suspiciously like a giggle, and carried her in to sit on the couch. She 
settled comfortably on his lap and rested her head on his shoulder, 
waiting for him to tell the story.

She knew most of it already. That was one reason why she was so upset. 
They had very nearly lost Asuka, whom Rei considered part of their 
mating unit. It felt very nearly as dreadful as when she thought Ranma 
had been killed by the Fifth angel. It was something that Rei deeply 
regretted that she was only able to tell how much she cared about 
someone after being faced with losing them.

&quot;Well, as you know, the angel, in chrysalis form, was in a volcano,&quot; 
Ranma began. &quot;At first things went pretty normally. They lowered Asuka 
down with no trouble but it turned out that the angel was a bit deeper 
than expected. She lost her prog knife on the way down but eventually 
she saw the angel.&quot;

As Ranma spoke, he was gently stroking Rei&#39;s back as she lay against 
him.

&quot;Asuka managed to successfully capture the chrysalis,&quot; Ranma continued, 
&quot;but as they started to winch her back up, the angel hatched. It broke 
free of the cage and came after her. I tossed her my prog knife but it 
didn&#39;t do any good; the angel&#39;s shell was too hard from developing in 
all the heat and pressure of the magma. Anyway, we figured out that we 
could pump it full of coolant, which would cause the shell to crack.

&quot;It worked and Asuka managed to destroy the angel, but in its death 
throws it severed the cables pulling her up. Well, I couldn&#39;t go losing 
one of you, so I jumped in and caught the severed ends of her cables so 
they could pull us up.&quot;

&quot;How is she?&quot; Rei asked softly.

&quot;As self-satisfied as ever,&quot; Ranma chuckled. &quot;I think she might have 
strained a few of my ribs in the hug she gave me when she got out of the 
entry plug. She and Misato are visiting the local hot spring and should 
be home tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;So we will be alone tonight?&quot; Rei asked tonelessly.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma confirmed, utterly not expecting what happened next.

Ranma felt Rei&#39;s slim hand rise up to meet his cheek with a 
feather-light touch. Gently, she turned his face toward hers until he 
was looking deeply into her crimson eyes. Slowly and hesitantly, her 
head began moving toward his as Ranma watched, mesmerized by her 
beautiful eyes. When those eyes closed, Ranma stiffened in anxiety as he 
realized their lips were scant millimeters apart. Because of their 
position, noses weren&#39;t a problem. Rei&#39;s lips brushed against Ranma&#39;s 
ever so tentatively, but then more firmly and confidently.

Ranma&#39;s eyes reflexively scanned the room for the threats that usually 
popped up at this point but found none. He felt overwhelmed in the 
moment and soon gave in. Tenderly, he began to kiss Rei back. This was 
good...very good. Ranma had never felt this close to anyone before and 
the feelings welling up inside him made him want to get closer yet.

Their kissing built to a hungry intensity as Ranma gently laid her back 
on the couch and lay himself beside her, raised up on one elbow to give 
him access to her hungry silken lips. Their legs intertwined with each 
other&#39;s as their tongues caressed and explored the other&#39;s mouth. Their 
hands weren&#39;t idle either as fingers stroked through hair and warm, 
flushed skin was touched and caressed.

For an hour, they kissed and stroked each other, never progressing 
beyond light petting, but being very thorough within those bounds. When 
the passion became too much, they finally stopped and cuddled each 
other, Rei spooned up to Ranma as he held her from behind.

&quot;Ranma?&quot; Rei said softly and timidly. &quot;I-I think I am falling in love 
with you.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;m fallin&#39; for you too, Rei,&quot; Ranma replied.

&quot;B-but there&#39;s something else,&quot; Rei pressed on. &quot;I-I think I also am 
beginning to care a great deal for Asuka as well.&quot;

&quot;Me too, Rei,&quot; Ranma chuckled softly.

&quot;I know she likes you a great deal,&quot; Rei said, barely above a whisper. 
&quot;Do you think...would it be possible for us to share you?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just see what happens,&quot; Ranma said, giving the blue-haired girl a 
reassuring squeeze. &quot;If all of us agree that this would be the best for 
us then I don&#39;t see why not.&quot;

&quot;That is acceptable,&quot; Rei murmured.

&quot;Rei? Thank you,&quot; Ranma said softly, nuzzling her neck.

&quot;For what?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;I knew I was gonna be teachin&#39; you, about livin&#39;, as well as the Art,&quot; 
Ranma explained. &quot;But I never figured on you teachin&#39; me how nice it is 
to show affection to someone you care about without being hit for it.&quot;

&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; Rei said, Ranma able to hear the smile in her 
voice.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Misato...&quot; Asuka said hesitantly as the two of them soaked in the hot 
spring. &quot;I&#146;m...uh...sorry about beating you like a drum. You were right; 
being here to fight is more important than a trip to Okinawa.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Asuka,&quot; Misato smiled. &quot;I&#39;d have been pissed off too if 
someone told me I couldn&#39;t go on the vacation I was looking forward to. 
That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not going to train and beat you down in the 
rematch though.&quot;

&quot;Game on,&quot; Asuka said, smirking wickedly.

The pair giggled before falling silent again.

&quot;Misato?&quot; Asuka asked nervously. &quot;What do you think of Ranma?&quot;

Misato laughed.

&quot;I think if I was 10 years younger, we&#39;d be having hot, steamy, marathon 
sex at every opportunity,&quot; Misato grinned as Asuka blinked at her. &quot;You 
really like him, don&#39;tcha?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Asuka sighed wistfully. &quot;I don&#39;t understand it. He&#39;s uncultured, 
arrogant, he&#39;s got that weird curse, and I have to share him with 
Wondergirl...&quot;

&quot;But he&#39;s strong, smart, kind, gorgeous in both forms, knows a woman&#39;s 
body better than any man you&#39;ll ever meet,&quot; Misato listed. &quot;He&#39;s the 
most talented fighter I&#39;ve ever seen. He&#39;s loyal to his friends, and 
he&#39;s not afraid to risk his life to protect those he cares about. Does 
that about sum it up?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s also someone who can relate to my past,&quot; Asuka added. &quot;And when he 
saved me...I just can&#39;t describe how I felt. I mean one moment I&#39;m as 
good as dead and the next, there he is, snatching me back to safety, 
like, no matter what, he&#39;ll always be there to protect me. I-I&#39;ve never 
felt this strongly for someone. I mean I thought I was in love with 
Kaji, but that didn&#39;t feel anything like this.&quot;

&quot;Trust me on this one, Ranma is a much better catch than Kaji,&quot; Misato 
said. &quot;Kaji may be cute in a scruffy sort of way, and he may know how to 
smooth talk a woman, but in the end, that&#39;s all it is, just talk. With 
Ranma, if he tells you something, you can take it to the bank. What 
about Rei? Are you really willing to share?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Asuka answered. &quot;It&#39;s weird. She&#39;s so different than 
anyone I&#39;ve ever met. At first, I was really put off by how 
dispassionate she seems, but then, watching her with Ranma, you can tell 
there&#39;s a lot more below the surface than she lets on. The weirdest part 
is; I don&#39;t think I can picture being with Ranma without her too.&quot;

&quot;The idea of being with another girl doesn&#39;t bother you?&quot; Misato 
grinned, causing Asuka to blush deeply.

&quot;Yeah, well, I did think about that,&quot; Asuka said. &quot;I&#39;d be lying if I 
said I wasn&#39;t curious. I guess if you want to be with Ranma it&#39;s 
something you better be able to deal with since his curse makes it part 
of the package. It&#39;d be kinda shallow to only show him I care when he&#39;s 
in guy form.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s an awfully mature view,&quot; Misato commented, mildly surprised.

&quot;Well, Rei and I talked about it,&quot; Asuka admitted. &quot;She has no problems 
being attracted to him in either form and she has this weird gift of 
distilling what&#39;s important from everything else with just a couple 
short words. She&#39;s the one that convinced me you can&#39;t care for half the 
person and not the other half. Besides, Ranma and I have a lot of fun 
playing twins.&quot;

Misato laughed. The two were fun to watch when they messed with people&#39;s 
minds and they were really cute. Especially with Rei playing the 
ultimate straight man, the three of them just seemed to belong together.

(oO\O/Oo)

When Asuka and Misato returned home, Asuka walked in the door to find 
herself in a bone-crunching hug delivered by a relieved, if not 
obviously so, Rei. At first the redhead stiffened but then she began to 
return the embrace.

&quot;I am pleased that you are well,&quot; Rei said softly. &quot;I was...distraught 
when it appeared you were lost. Please do not do so again.&quot;

Asuka giggled softly at Rei&#39;s impersonal manner of expressing her very 
personal concern.

&quot;Hey, no worries,&quot; Asuka grinned. &quot;I&#39;m fine and Variable-chan wouldn&#39;t 
have let anything happen to me.&quot;

Asuka looked over Rei&#39;s shoulder to see a grinning Ranma leaning 
casually against the wall watching them. She held out her hand to him 
and he came over and joined the hug.

The warm, fuzzy moment was interrupted by the flash of a camera causing 
the teens to separate, although clearly reluctantly, with each sporting 
a blush. Misato giggled as she put down her camera and cracked open a 
beer.

&quot;You know,&quot; Misato teased them, &quot;if you guys keep this up, I don&#39;t know 
if I&#39;ll be able to stand the sweetness. I&#39;ll have to move out due to the 
over-exposure to &#39;cute&#39;. Us lonely old women have a low tolerance to 
that sort of thing, you know?&quot;

Ranma and Asuka grinned wickedly, looking at each other and then Rei in 
silent communication. Suddenly, Misato found herself in the middle of a 
group glomp.

&quot;But we love you, Misato,&quot; Asuka said.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re stuck with us,&quot; Ranma agreed.

&quot;Your relocation from our home would be most distressing,&quot; Rei 
concurred.

&quot;Aww, you guys,&quot; Misato laughed, very touched. &quot;I love you guys too.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Look, there&#39;s Ranma,&quot; Kensuke announced. &quot;And he&#39;s holding hands with 
both Rei and Asuka! Oh, man, I don&#39;t know whether to envy him or feel 
sorry for him.&quot;

&quot;What? Where?&quot; Toji asked, coming to the window.

&quot;Ah geez,&quot; Ichiro whined. &quot;Ikari is hording all the babes. That guy is 
so lucky.&quot;

There was a general chorus of agreement there.

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Toji snorted. &quot;Like any of you knuckleheads even noticed 
Ayanami before Ranma started dating her.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but did he have to take the most popular girl in school too?&quot; 
Jiro complained.

&quot;Believe me, you guys don&#39;t want any part of the Red Demon,&quot; Toji said 
gravely, Kensuke nodding vigorously in agreement. &quot;She&#39;s got a bigger 
ego than Ranma and an attitude to match it.&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;s so hot!&quot; Daichi said, getting another chorus of agreement. 
&quot;It&#39;s not right! He already had Rei. He didn&#39;t have to take Asuka too!&quot;

&quot;Well what are you gonna do about it?&quot; Toji smirked. &quot;Beat him up? I 
can&#39;t even touch the guy in a fight. You morons wouldn&#39;t have a prayer.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just saying that because you&#39;re already dating Horaki,&quot; Jiro 
said. &quot;What about the rest of us?&quot;

Toji blinked. Dating the class rep? He began to think about all those 
times the girl had been along with them when they hung out. He had 
thought she was just friends with Ranma, but now that he thought about 
it, she did seem to always be close to him. Come to think of it, Hikari 
was pretty enough, a little overbearing at times, but she was nice. Toji 
smiled. Yeah, he could do a lot worse.

&quot;Well, maybe if you jerks asked a girl out instead of obsessing about 
who Ikari&#39;s dating, you&#39;d be dating someone too,&quot; Toji smirked.

Meanwhile at the other end of the classroom, Hikari was getting grilled 
by the girls.

&quot;So Hikari, you hang out with Ranma&#39;s group,&quot; Ayame said. &quot;What&#39;s going 
on there? Is he really dating both Asuka and Rei?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, what&#39;s going on with that?&quot; Hoshi demanded. &quot;I mean we still had 
a chance if it was just Ayanami, but if he&#39;s dating Asuka, we&#39;re sunk.&quot;

&quot;I guess they are dating,&quot; Hikari admitted.

&quot;That&#39;s weird,&quot; Michi said. &quot;How can Asuka date a guy that&#39;s dating 
another girl at the same time?&quot;

&quot;Well, they are all pilots,&quot; Hikari said. &quot;Maybe they have some sort of 
bond.&quot;

&quot;OH! That&#39;s so romantic!&quot; Kiko gushed, holding her hands up beside her 
face. &quot;Joined together in the heat of battle when Ranma saved them from 
certain death! They&#39;re so lucky!&quot;

The other girls sweat-dropped.

&quot;Well, anyway, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with it,&quot; Hikari said. &quot;It&#39;s 
not like he&#39;s two-timing them. I know Ranma and he&#39;s not like that. If 
anything, Asuka and Rei agreed to share him. They do fit together well.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, kinda like fire and ice,&quot; Ayame snickered.

(oO\O/Oo)

The girls finally managed to corner Asuka later that day in the gym 
locker room. Asuka finished changing into her gym clothes and turned 
around to find herself surrounded by a group of determined looking 
girls. Then the interrogation started.

&quot;Is it true you and Ayanami are both dating Ranma?&quot;

&quot;How can you stand to date a guy that&#39;s dating another girl at the same 
time?&quot;

&quot;Have you kissed him yet?&quot;

&quot;Have you kissed her yet?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you live with him? Have you seen him naked?&quot;

Questions peppered the beleaguered redhead from all sides.

&quot;Meine Gott!&quot; Asuka screamed. &quot;Stop it! If you must know, yes, Rei and I 
are both dating Ranma. Yes, I&#39;m happy about it. No, I haven&#39;t kissed him 
yet and I certainly haven&#39;t kissed her yet. It&#39;s none of your business 
whether I&#39;ve seen him naked. Ranma is a great guy and he cares for both 
of us. Rei and I decided that we wouldn&#39;t make him choose between us. If 
anyone doesn&#39;t like it, well that&#39;s just too damn bad because it works 
for us! Idioten!&quot;

Asuka shoved her way through the crowd of girls and stalked out of the 
locker room.

The crowd of girls blinked.

&quot;Did she say that she hadn&#39;t kissed Rei yet?&quot; someone asked.

&quot;Ewwww!&quot; several of them chorused.

(oO\O/Oo)

In the boys&#39; locker room, a similar scene was taking place. Being boys, 
the questions were far more crude. There were also some demands mixed in 
to know where Ranma got off thinking he rated two girls. When the 
questions started to get more explicit, Ranma exploded.

&quot;That&#39;s IT!&quot; Ranma shouted. &quot;The next one of you perverted jerks that 
asks me questions like that is gonna get their head busted! It ain&#39;t 
none of your damn business what goes on between Asuka, Rei, and me! 
Ain&#39;t nobody forcing anybody to do anything! If this is what they want, 
well, I care about them both, and I want them both to be happy! You 
jackasses got a problem with that, that&#39;s just too damn bad, because I 
don&#39;t really give a rat&#39;s ass. The only thing that matters to me is Rei 
and Asuka&#39;s happiness. And if I find out any of you jerks are harassing 
them you&#39;ll be eating through a straw.&quot;

Ranma stormed out, flanked by Toji and Kensuke. As he exited the locker 
room with a scowl on his face, he saw a similarly scowling Asuka come 
out of the girls&#39; locker room.

&quot;Was it bad?&quot; Ranma asked, a look of concern replacing the scowl.

&quot;It&#39;s wasn&#39;t too bad,&quot; Asuka smiled reassuringly. &quot;How about you?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re a real pack of perverts,&quot; Ranma growled before looking over to 
Rei who had been waiting for Asuka to come out. &quot;How about you, Rei?&quot;

&quot;I have not been bothered,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Okay, well, you guys let me know if any guys bother you and I&#39;ll take 
care of it,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;I&#39;m sure there won&#39;t be any problems, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka smirked. 
&quot;They&#39;re just jealous of us is all.&quot;

&quot;Well, I am dating the two prettiest girls in school,&quot; Ranma grinned, 
proud of his moment of inspiration as Rei and Asuka blushed cutely.

&quot;Yeah, well, between Rei and I, we&#39;ve got the school&#39;s most prime 
beefcake locked down tight,&quot; Asuka smiled.

&quot;That you do,&quot; Ranma smirked.

&quot;Um...if you guys are done stroking each other&#39;s egos, could we go to 
class now?&quot; Toji deadpanned.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Hold the door!&quot; Misato heard a familiar voice call out from down the 
hall as she boarded the elevator.

Her face remained expressionless as she reached out and casually 
depressed the button to close the doors. The doors slowly began to close 
as the sound of running feet drew closer. Just before they did, a hand 
slipped between them.

Misato grimaced sourly in disappointment.

&quot;Whew, made it,&quot; Kaji puffed, cheerfully ignoring the fact that Misato 
had not held the door for him. &quot;I haven&#39;t run that fast in a long time. 
Why the sour face?&quot;

&quot;Because something in here stinks,&quot; Misato sneered glibly, her eye 
twitching.

&quot;Well, I took a shower this morning so it couldn&#39;t be me,&quot; Kaji smirked.

Misato&#39;s teeth began to grind as she growled at him.

&quot;Misato...&quot; Kaji began smoothly, putting his right hand on her shoulder.

Misato grabbed his hand with her right hand, pulled him forward and 
grabbed the back of his head with her left hand, slamming his face into 
the elevator doors before driving a knee into his kidney.

&quot;Owie,&quot; Kaji groaned as he slid to the floor.

Misato smirked, looking very self-satisfied, and ignored the groans. 
After a minute, Kaji struggled to his feet.

&quot;Ranma?&quot; he asked curiously.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Misato smirked, glad for Ranma&#39;s training for a change. &quot;Touch me 
again and you&#39;ll be pissing blood from both kidneys.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t have that, now can we?&quot; Kaji drawled.

Suddenly the elevator stopped moving and the lights went out, plunging 
them into total darkness for a moment before the red emergency lighting 
came on.

&quot;Power failure?&quot; Kaji asked casually.

&quot;Nothing to worry about,&quot; Misato said. &quot;The back up circuits should kick 
in any minute now.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Ritsuko stood in the red light of the control booth where they had been 
running the power-up checks on the newly refitted Unit 00 when the power 
went down. Her eyes darted from side to side, looking at the various 
techs looking at her.

&quot;Um...that wasn&#39;t us,&quot; she offered with a hint of defensiveness in her 
tone. &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s get the door open and find out what&#39;s going on.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;I know you guys want some time out with me in my guy form, but I don&#39;t 
see how me being dressed like this is going to score us any ice cream,&quot; 
Ranma said as he walked along with his arms around the two girls&#39; 
waists.

&quot;But you do look scrumptious, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka purred, reaching 
down and patting him on the butt.

Ranma was wearing a black t-shirt that was about two sizes too small for 
him and a tight pair of jeans. Under the tight shirt and jeans, you 
could see every ripple of every muscle as he moved. Even though he was 
obviously with the two girls flanking him, more than one woman had 
walked into a light pole while watching him instead of where she was 
walking. A couple of girls even developed nose bleeds which filled Asuka 
with pride and satisfaction.

&quot;Thanks, I guess,&quot; Ranma said, stiffening slightly when Asuka patted his 
butt. &quot;This isn&#39;t really my style. These jeans are a little tight to 
move around in freely, but if you guys like it, I guess it&#39;s okay every 
once in a while. You guys are looking pretty hot too.&quot;

Asuka was wearing a black mini-skirt with a small, blue crop-top that 
gave flashes of her tight tummy. Rei was wearing a pair of tight, white 
chino shorts with a tight, red tank top. Like Ranma, the girls were 
causing more than a few guys to collide with various obstacles as they 
craned their necks to look.

&quot;Um...guys, do you notice anything weird?&quot; Ranma asked, perplexed.

&quot;Like what, Variable-chan?&quot; Asuka asked.

&quot;The electricity is out,&quot; Rei said after a pause.

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s it,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Things are too still and quiet.&quot;

&quot;Maybe we should call in and see if anything&#39;s wrong?&quot; Asuka suggested.

Rei pulled out her cell phone and looked at it.

&quot;I am not getting a signal,&quot; Rei said.

Ranma and Asuka confirmed that their cell phones weren&#39;t getting a 
signal either. They had similar results when they tried the pay phone.

&quot;Now what?&quot; Asuka asked. &quot;Do you think it&#39;s an attack?&quot;

Rei reached into her purse and pulled out an envelope. She quickly 
opened it and read the contents.

&quot;The emergency orders say we should report to NERV,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Right, well, lead the way, Rei-chan,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;It&#39;s this way,&quot; Rei said, walking off toward the nearest entrance to 
the geo-front.

(oO\O/Oo)

Motoko Hyuga was walking toward NERV when JSDF aircraft flew over 
announcing that an angel had been spotted headed toward Tokyo-3.

&quot;Oh man, I have to report this to headquarters,&quot; he said, looking around 
at the empty streets.

Suddenly a horn beeped and Hyuga heard his name called over a loud 
speaker. Turning, he saw one of NERV&#39;s utility trucks bearing down on 
him.

&quot;We have to get to headquarters and tell them about the angel,&quot; Hyuga 
said urgently as the truck stopped beside him.

&quot;Right!&quot; the driver said as Hyuga got in.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;It&#39;s so hot,&quot; Misato whined, fanning herself.

&quot;Well, if you want, you can always take off your shirt,&quot; Kaji grinned. 
&quot;It&#39;s not like you have anything I haven&#39;t seen before.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re such a jerk, Kaji,&quot; Misato growled, zipping up her jacket and 
buttoning the collar. &quot;You won&#39;t ever see it again if I have anything to 
say about it.&quot;

&quot;You wound me, Misato,&quot; Kaji drawled melodramatically.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna wound you if you come near me,&quot; Misato spat.

(oO\O/Oo)

Rei led Ranma and Asuka through the labyrinth of tunnels into the 
geo-front. As they passed under a vehicle access road, they heard a 
vehicle approaching and a voice calling out over a loudspeaker.

&quot;That sounds like Hyuga,&quot; Ranma commented.

&quot;There&#39;s an angel approaching!&quot; the loud speaker announced. &quot;Everyone 
get to cover, there is an angel approaching!&quot;

&quot;Aw, man, what a time for an angel to attack,&quot; Asuka moaned.

&quot;Figures,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I guess we better hurry.&quot;

The trio hurried on through the corridors until they hit a dead end 
where a large slab of debris was blocking the tunnel.

&quot;Now what?&quot; Asuka asked. &quot;I don&#39;t think even you could get through that, 
Variable-chan.&quot;

&quot;I might be able to blast through it with a ki blast, but I don&#39;t think 
it&#39;d be a good idea. It might bring the roof down on us,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;There is another way,&quot; Rei said, stepping over to an air vent and 
removing the cover. &quot;This way.&quot;

Rei entered the duct followed by Asuka, with Ranma bringing up the rear. 
They were forced to crawl along on their hands and knees due to the 
height of the duct. It wasn&#39;t the most comfortable way to get there, but 
Ranma had to admit he was enjoying the view.

&quot;Ranma, are you looking up my skirt?&quot; Asuka demanded.

&quot;Um...yeah?&quot; Ranma said with a nervous chuckle and braced himself for 
the boot-to-da-head.

&quot;Good, just checking,&quot; Asuka giggled and gave her tush a little wiggle.

A loud clang was heard as Ranma face-faulted hard into the bottom of the 
duct.

&quot;Owie,&quot; Ranma mentioned as he pulled his face out of the large dent.

(oO\O/Oo)

After Hyuga had arrived to inform them of the angel, Gendo Ikari 
marshaled the NERV personnel and currently they were preparing the Eva&#39;s 
for launch manually. Ritsuko and Maya stood on the platform watching the 
men hoist the entry plugs into position with ropes and pullies.

&quot;Can we really launch the Eva&#39;s manually?&quot; Maya asked.

&quot;It shouldn&#39;t be a problem,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;Once everything is in place, 
the diesel generator will provide enough power to insert the entry 
plugs.&quot;

&quot;But who&#39;s going to pilot them?&quot; Maya asked.

Suddenly, there were three light thumps behind them.

&quot;That would be us,&quot; Ranma smirked as the two women turned toward the 
sound to see the three pilots standing there.

&quot;There you guys are,&quot; Ritsuko said, as if they hadn&#39;t just dropped out 
of the ventilation duct. &quot;Commander Ikari has almost got the Eva&#39;s ready 
for you. You just need to suit up and we can launch.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

The angel, weirdly resembling a Daddy-long-legs spider, made its way 
into Tokyo-3. It marched through the city, drawn to the point where it 
would make its attack. Soon, it reached the area and settled its body 
close to the ground. From a large eye on the bottom of its body, it 
began to drip acid. The acid fell on the ground and began to eat through 
the armored access cover of the shaft that would lead it toward its 
goal.

As the angel was beginning its attack, three Eva&#39;s were moving toward 
the surface to engage it. Each carried a naginata and two short-shafted 
spears clamped to its back. In addition to that, each had been fitted 
with two large auxiliary battery packs fixed to their shoulder pylons.

Asuka had taken the point position and was leading Rei while Ranma 
followed closely behind her. They finally reached the vertical shaft 
that would take them to the surface and they began to scale the shaft by 
bracing themselves with their hands and feet on the walls. Laboriously, 
they began to ascend.

They had made it a good distance up the shaft when the first drops of 
acid began to rain down on Asuka. She screamed in pain as a large amount 
fell on Unit 02&#39;s back and began to dissolve the batteries. Some of it 
splashed out and landed on the wall immediately above the foot she was 
using to brace herself with. The wall liquefied as the acid ran down 
causing the bracing foot to slip. Deprived of the friction necessary to 
hold itself, Unit 02 fell.

The red Eva slammed into the, now, bright-blue unit 00, causing Rei to 
lose her grip. Ranma saw the two Evas falling toward him and desperately 
anchored his Eva to the walls of the shaft using his ki/AT field. He 
grunted as the pair impacted heavily but he maintained his hold.

&quot;You girls okay?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;I am well,&quot; Rei responded.

&quot;I&#39;m fine but we have to get out of this shaft,&quot; Asuka said. &quot;That thing 
is pouring acid down on us.&quot;

A minute later the three Evas were crouched in a side tunnel trying to 
think of a plan.

&quot;Okay, anyone got any ideas?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;I think I might have one,&quot; Asuka spoke up. &quot;Ranma, do you think you can 
do that thing you did when we fought the angel underwater with just 
battery power?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but it will completely drain the batteries,&quot; Ranma answered.

&quot;Then you&#39;ll have to make the shot count,&quot; Asuka grinned. &quot;Rei, do you 
think you can project your AT field like Ranma has been teaching us?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rei replied verbosely.

&quot;Good, here&#39;s the plan,&quot; Asuka explained the plan to them. &quot;Everybody 
understand?&quot;

&quot;Affirmative,&quot; Rei acknowledged.

&quot;Got it,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Great plan, Asuka-chan.&quot;

Asuka blushed under the praise as Ranma sat Unit 01 down at the edge of 
the tunnel with his back toward the shaft. Asuka squatted Unit 02 down, 
bracing Unit 01&#39;s legs. Once they were in position, Rei began projecting 
her AT field out at an angle away from the shaft wall, deflecting the 
acid away from them. Ranma leaned back until Unit 01&#39;s upper torso was 
sticking straight out into the shaft and began to gather his ki-infused 
AT field.

Once he focused the energy into a giant, reddish-gold ball, he gave Rei 
the signal.

&quot;Mouko Takabisha!&quot; Ranma shouted as Rei dropped her AT field.

The ki/AT ball rocketed up the shaft, incinerating the acid as it went. 
When it reached surface, it struck the angel and vaporized its body in a 
massive explosion. The angel&#39;s legs, all that remained of it, fell to 
the ground.

Back in the tunnel, Rei&#39;s battery went dead just after she dropped the 
AT field. Unit 00 swayed on its feet and began to fall. Asuka reached 
out and grabbed Unit 00 with one hand and guided Rei&#39;s unit to fall 
safely inside the tunnel rather than into the shaft. Then she had just 
enough time to drag Unit 01&#39;s limp form back into the tunnel before her 
power ran out as well.

(oO\O/Oo)

Misato stood with her knees on Kaji&#39;s shoulders as she tried to open the 
access hatch in the top of the elevator.

&quot;It won&#39;t open,&quot; Misato whined as she pounded on the hatch. &quot;Why won&#39;t 
it open? Are you looking up my skirt?&quot;

&quot;No, Misato,&quot; Kaji said tiredly. &quot;Hurry up, I can&#39;t hold you up there 
forever.&quot;

&quot;You better not be, and I&#39;m trying,&quot; Misato said.

Suddenly, the lights came back on and the elevator jerked into motion. 
Kaji lost his balance and he fell to the floor with Misato landing on 
top of him. Just then the elevator doors opened revealing a crowd of 
people gaping at the compromising position the pair were in. Ritsuko 
stood at the front of the pack, wearing a disapproving look.

&quot;Sex fiends,&quot; Maya commented over Ritsuko&#39;s shoulder.

(oO\O/Oo)

Asuka sat back on the couch. Ranma was reclined against her, his head 
resting comfortably on her tummy, fast asleep. Rei was curled up on top 
of him with her head resting on his chest as he held her in his arms. 
The two of them had been so drained by their efforts they had barely 
made it home before they passed out.

Asuka gently stroked Ranma&#39;s hair as she watched over Ranma and her 
co-girlfriend. They looked so cute laying there asleep and Asuka was 
suddenly filled with a fierce possessiveness for both of them. &#39;Mine!&#39; 
the thought rang through her head. She could hardly believe how strongly 
she felt for the pair. If someone had told her before she came here that 
she would be happily involved in a relationship like this, that person 
would have been the victim of her fiery temper and a hard slap in the 
face.

Now, all she wanted to do was grab them both and hold them tightly to 
her. The fears she hid deep inside didn&#39;t seem to matter when she was 
with them. Somehow she knew that they would never let anything happen to 
her. Likewise, she would protect them to her last breath. It was swiftly 
becoming such that Asuka couldn&#39;t picture her life without Ranma and Rei 
as her mates.

Asuka idly traced the line of Ranma&#39;s jaw with the back of her hand. 
Ranma nuzzled up against it in his sleep causing the redhead to smile 
gently. Her other hand softly toyed with a few stray locks of Rei&#39;s blue 
hair. For the first time she could remember, she felt fulfilled and 
happy.

(oO\O/Oo)

When Nabiki stopped the tape the room was silent except for a few soft 
sniffles from the fianc&eacute;es. The beginning of the episode had confirmed 
their worst fears. Ranma had confessed his love for two girls that were 
not them. Asuka and Rei had succeeded where they had failed and they 
were heartbroken.

The four older females in the room looked on in compassion as the three 
of them sat there as if shell-shocked. Ukyo had tears streaming down her 
face as she struggled to contain her pain. Shampoo sat stoically with 
very little trace of her accustomed bubbly personality. Akane refused to 
cry again, but they could see the pain in her eyes as her bottom lip 
quivered.

Kasumi, while sad for the fianc&eacute;es, was deeply touched by the sweet, 
affectionate scenes with Ranma and the two girls in the video. She was 
very happy for Ranma, but she found she was at odds with herself. She 
wanted Ranma to return to them, but she found that she also hoped he 
could stay there with the girls he loved. She was glad she didn&#39;t have 
to choose whether he came back or not.

Sighing wistfully, she got up and went into the kitchen to make some 
tea.</pre>
