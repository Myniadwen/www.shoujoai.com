vol 1 part 1
The Lost Sisters

------------------------------------------------

	It was just after noon when the bus pulled into the
 Nermia bus station.

	The first person to get off the bus was a a girl with 
bright red hair tied in a pigtail.  She was dressed in a red 
kung-fu style silk shirt and a pair of baggy black pants.  She 
carried a large backpack at her side.

	&quot;Red!  Wait for me!&quot;  yelled a voice from inside the 
bus.

	The emergency exit at the back of the bus popped 
open and another girl hopped out.  She had sholder length 
brown hair held back by a yellow checkered bandanna.  She 
was dressed in a white t-shirt and jeans and held an even 
larger and heaver backpack over her shoulder.

	&quot;Honestly, Yoiko.  Can&#39;t I take you anywhere?&quot;  the 
pigtailed girl asked.

	&quot;Well, I couldn&#39;t find the door, okay?&quot;  Yoiko 
replied.

	The pigtailed girl sighed and added this incident to 
the long list of evidence that her friend was a ditz with no 
sense of direction.  Her stomach growled and she realized 
that she missed breakfast this morning.  &quot;I&#39;m hungry.  Hey, 
Yoiko!  Where do you want to eat?&quot;  She looked down the 
street and saw two restaurants facing eash other on opposite 
sides of the road.  &quot;Let&#39;s see.  We have The Cat Cafe 
Chinese restaurant or Ucchan&#39;s Okonomiyaki.&quot;

	&quot;Oh!  I love okonomiyaki!&quot;  Yoiko said with a big 
grin on her face, exposing a pair of extremely cute fangs.

	&quot;Ucchan&#39;s it is, then.&quot;  the pigtailed girl said as they 
started down the street.  Just then she saw a certain purple 
hared Chinese girl park her bike and enter the Cat Cafe.  
&quot;On second thought, I feel like ramen for lunch.&quot;

	&quot;Oh, no.  I know that look.&quot;  Yoiko sounded rather 
irritated.  &quot;I&#39;m not giving up my favorite so you can chase 
some cute waitress.&quot;

	&quot;Well, do you think you can make it accross the 
street by yourself?&quot;

	&quot;Of course.  I&#39;m not completely clueless, you know!&quot;  
Yoiko yelled as she stormed across the street and entered 
the flower shop next to Ucchan&#39;s.  The pigtailed girl waited 
five minutes for her to realize where she was and to find the 
right door.

	&quot;She&#39;s hopeless.&quot;  the pigtailed girl said to herself as 
she entered the Cat Cafe.

	&quot;Wota airen!&quot;  Shampoo yelled as she glomped on 
to her beloved.  The pigtailed girl was surprised but happy 
none the less.  That is until her stomach growled again.

	&quot;Um, as much as I like having beautiful girls throw 
themselves at me, I&#39;m starving.&quot;  the pigtailed girl said.  
&quot;Can I get a bowl of ramen?&quot;

	&quot;O. K.&quot;  Shampoo replied.  &quot;Shampoo get you 
ramen on house, yes?&quot;  Then she planted a kiss on the girls 
lips and was suprised to find it returned.

	&quot;That&#39;s great.&quot;  the pigtailed girl said after the kiss 
ended.  I&#39;ll have to remember this place, she thought.

	As Shampoo disappeared into the kitchen, Mousse 
appeared, burning with rage.

	&quot;Saotome!&quot;  Mousse yelled, his anger just barely 
under control.

	The pigtailed girl wondered how this guy knew her 
name, then she saw that it was written on her backpack.  
&quot;What?&quot;  she replied.

	&quot;Why must you taunt me with such displays!&quot;  he 
said, his eyes aflame with hatred as he leaned in close to the 
girl.

	Uh, oh.  Jealous boyfriend, she thought.  Well, I 
guess any guy would be pissed if he saw his girl kissing 
another girl.  &quot;Oh! That.&quot;  she said.  &quot;Sorry.  I&#39;ll make it up 
to you.&quot;  With that she leaned forward and kissed him.

	&quot;How...DARE...you...&quot;  Mousse gasped.

	Okay, plan B, she thought and kissed him again, this 
time adding her tongue.

	Mousse froze.  His mortal enemy was frenching him.  
After the girl pulled back, he got up and stumbled into the 
kitchen.

	&lt;Mousse.&gt;  Cologne said in Chinese.  &lt;Isn&#39;t Son-In-
Law acting strange today?&gt;

	&lt;Well, he just had his tongue down my throat.&gt;  
Mousse said, still in shock.

	&lt;WHAT!?!&gt;  Cologne yelled.

	Just then the pigtailed girl popped her head in the 
kitchen.  &lt;One:  I am not acting strange.  Two:  My tongue 
wasn&#39;t that fat in your mouth.  And three:  Since I happen to 
be a girl at the moment, the correct term in Daughter-In-
Law.  Not that I would want to be related to you.  Now, 
where&#39;s my ramen.&gt;  Sha said in perfect Chinese.  The still 
shocked Mousse handed her a bowl of ramen which she 
thanked him for in Chinese.

	An equally shocked Cologne yelled, &quot;Wait!  When 
did you learn Chinese?&quot;

	&quot;My education is none of your business.&quot;  the girl 
said and took her food back to her table.

	&quot;Shampoo, I think your betrothed has been a girl for 
too long.&quot;  Cologne said.

	&quot;Huh?  Oh, O. K.&quot;  Shampoo said.  Luckily she 
wasn&#39;t paying attention because she was still giddy from the 
show of affection from her loved one.  She grabbed a tea 
kettle and went to the front of the restaurant.

	The pigtailed girl was busy finishing her ramen, so 
she didn&#39;t notice the steaming kettle over her head until it 
was too late.  She jumped up as the hot water touched her 
head.

	Shampoo found herself face to face with a very wet, 
very annoyed, and very female pigtailed girl.  Her brain 
couldn&#39;t handle this, so she did the only thing she could.  
She screamed.

	The pigtailed girl found herself face to face with a 
screaming Chinese girl, so she did the only thing she could.  
She ran.  At least it was free, she thought.

	Outside, the girl ran across the street to catch her 
breath.  &quot;That was weird.&quot;  she said.  When she saw the 
shadow cover her, she knew trouble was coming.  She 
jumped out of the way as Ryoga landed, leaving a crack in 
the sidewalk.

	&quot;I&#39;ll kill you!&quot;  Ryoga yelled.  He never needed a 
reason to lash out in anger.  He figured that his hellish 
existence justified it.

	The pigtailed girl looked at her attacker and 
recognized something.  &quot;Do I know you?&quot;  she asked.

	Ryoga stopped dead in his tracks.  It was one thing 
for his childhood foe to forget him after a few years, but to 
forget him after this morning?  &quot;Of course you know me, 
stupid!&quot;  he yelled.

	Just let me see if I remember you.&quot;  the girl said, 
changing her voice slightly.

	&quot;Um...okay.&quot;  Ryoga replied.  He couldn&#39;t help but 
obey.  The girl&#39;s voice was calming and almost hypnotic.

	&quot;Well, judging by the crack you made in the 
sidewalk, you have almost superhuman strength.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.&quot;

	&quot;Let me ask you something.&quot;

	&quot;What?&quot;

	&quot;If I were to ask you to go buy me a gallon of milk, 
how long would it take you.  Be honest.&quot;

	&quot;About a week.&quot;  Ryoga blurted out, then looked 
embarrassed at being reminded of his major weakness.

	&quot;Come closer.&quot;

	&quot;Huh?&quot;  Ryoga leaned in closer to the girl.

	The girl reached behind his head and untied his 
bandanna.  She recognized the pattern.  She looked up to 
see Ryoga wearing another bandanna.  She untied it and 
found another.  And another.  &quot;You&#39;ve got infinite 
bandannas.&quot;  she said after the fifth one.

	&quot;I guess.&quot;  he replied.  He never thought of it that 
way before.

	&quot;Open your mouth.&quot;

	&quot;Why?&quot;

	&quot;Just do it!&quot;  She grabbed his chin and started 
inspecting his teeth.  &quot;You&#39;ve got fangs.&quot;  she stated plainly.

	&quot;Yeah, so?&quot;  This inspection was irritating him.

	&quot;Okay, last test.&quot;  the girl said.

	&quot;Oh, goo-mphf...&quot;  His words were cut off by a pair 
of lips pressed against his own.  He started getting angry 
again until he felt a tongue forcing its way into his mouth.  
Then he blacked out.

	The pigtailed girl felt Ryoga&#39;s body go limp, or at 
least most of his body go limp.  She felt a drop of warm 
fluid run down her cheek.  She pushed him back and saw 
that he passed out and his nose was bleeding.  &quot;You&#39;re 
definitely a Hibiki.&quot;  she said and dropped him.  After he 
made a satisfying thud on the cement, she walked into 
Ucchan&#39;s

	Ukyo looked up from the grill when she heard the 
door open.  She had been making the fifth okonomiyaki for 
a strange girl who, upon entering the restaurant, had 
extreme difficulty finding a table, even though there were 
several empty.  Oh well, she thought.  At least her appetite 
was worth the wait.  When Ukyo saw who had just walked 
in, her eyes lit up.  &quot;Ran-chan!&quot;  she called.

	&quot;Um...Ucchan?&quot;  the pigtailed girl replied, reading 
the name off the cook&#39;s apron.  She made a mental note to 
remove her name from her backpack.  It was causing too 
many strange moments.

	&quot;Oh!  Hi, Red!&quot;  Yoiko called after stuffing down 
the last okonomiyaki.

	&quot;You know each other?&quot;  Ukyo asked Yoiko.

	&quot;Yeah, we&#39;ve been friends for years.&quot;  Yoiko 
answered.

	&quot;JUST FRIENDS, RIGHT?!&quot;  Ukyo asked, a 
threatening tone in her voice.

	&quot;You mean, you think we&#39;re...HAHAHAHA...&quot;  
Yoiko couldn&#39;t help but laugh.  &quot;Me...and Red!&quot;  Even I&#39;m 
not that desperate.&quot;

	&quot;Good.&quot;  Ukyo replied coldly.  &quot;I&#39;d hate to have to 
mop blood up off the floor.&quot;

	&quot;...&quot;  Yoiko was at a loss for words.

	&quot;Yoiko, wait for me out front.&quot;  the pigtailed girl 
broke in.

	&quot;Okay.&quot;  Yoiko replied and walked past Ukyo and 
out the back door.  The redhead smacked herself in the 
forehead.

	&quot;Can I ask you a favor?&quot;  the girl asked Ukyo.

	&quot;Anything for you.&quot;  Ukyo replied, putting on her 
most loving expression.

	&quot;Well, there&#39;s a guy passed out on the sidewalk.  
Can you make sure he gets to this address?&quot;  The girl wrote 
down an address and handed it to Ukyo.

	Ukyo looked at the address.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to 
give me the address.  I know where the Tendo Dojo is.&quot;

	&quot;Good.  Oh!&quot;  The pigtailed girl remembered who 
she was trying to transport.  &quot;He gets lost easy, so call him a 
cab.&quot;  She handed Ukyo 3000 yen.  &quot;This should cover it.  
Bye.&quot;  Then the girl followed her friend out back.

	&quot;Ran-chan...with money?&quot;  Ukyo asked herself, then 
went out to find Ryoga lying on the ground.  &quot;Well, at least 
you&#39;ll be happy to see Akane when you wake up.  And I&#39;ll 
save Ran-chan&#39;s cash by taking you there personally.&quot;  Then 
she heard screaming coming from the Cat Cafe and smiled.  
Music to my ears, she thought.

	Later, Yoiko and the pigtailed girl were walking 
down the street toward Furinkan High School.

	&quot;Did you know that girl?&quot;  Yoiko asked.

	&quot;Who?  That Ucchan chick?  Nope.  Never seen her 
before.&quot;  the pigtailed girl replied.

	&quot;You sure?  She seemed jealous because she thought 
we were...involved...with each other.&quot;  Yoiko fought to 
control the laughter.

	&quot;Well, you can&#39;t say I don&#39;t try.&quot;  the girl replied with 
a mischievous grin.

	&quot;Pervert!&quot;

	&quot;Me?  A pervert?&quot;  The redhead tried to look 
shocked.  &quot;I just know how to have a good time, that&#39;s all.&quot;

	They stopped at the school gates and found a sign 
saying:  [School closed for two weeks fro repairs.  Sports 
clubs will meet in back for practice.]

	&quot;Damn!&quot;  the pigtailed girl said.  &quot;I was hoping to 
catch him at school.  Well, Maybe he&#39;s in a sports club.  
C&#39;mon Yoiko.&quot;

	They hopped the fence and went to the back of the 
school to find the kendo club finishing practice.

	The pigtailed girl decided for the direct approach.  
&quot;Hey!  Does anyone know...&quot;

	&quot;Pigtailed girl!&quot;  Kuno yelled as he leapt forward to 
embrace his love.

	&quot;Ahh!  What are you doing!&quot;  the girl yelled as she 
tried to break free of Kuno&#39;s grasp.

	&quot;Showing my love for you, my goddess.&quot;  Kuno 
answered, and squeezed her tighter.

	&quot;While I appreciate someone acknowledging me as 
the goddess that I am,  I think this is a bit much!&quot;  The 
pigtailed girl screamed.  &quot;Yoiko!  Help!&quot;

	&quot;Do I have to?&quot;  Yoiko asked.  &quot;He&#39;s kind of cute.&quot;

	&quot;Get him offa me!&quot;

	&quot;Okay.&quot;  Yoiko said and raised her arms in a fighting 
position.

	&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;  Kuno said, releasing his grip on the 
girl.  &quot;Someone dares come between me and my love.  No 
doubt you have been charmed by my handsome visage, but 
my heart is already taken.&quot;  Kuno raised his boken in 
preparation for the fight.

	&quot;Get to it, Yoiko!&quot;  the pigtailed girl cheered from 
the sidelines.

	&quot;EARTHQUAKE STRIKE!!!&quot;  Yoiko yelled as she 
struck the ground in front of her.  A crack in the earth 
appeared at her fist and raced to Kuno&#39;s feet.

	&quot;Is that all you can do?&quot;  Kuno asked.  Then the 
ground opened up and swallowed him up to his neck.

	&quot;Oh no!&quot;  Yoiko yelled and ran to his head which 
wac sticking out of the ground.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry Mr...Mr...&quot;

	&quot;K...u...n...o...&quot;  he said with a pained expression on 
his face.

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Kuno.  Please forgive me.&quot;  Yoiko 
cried, tears streaming down her cheeks.

	&quot;I...forgive...you.&quot;  Kuno said and passed out.

	&quot;One cute guy and you fall to pieces.&quot;  The pigtailed 
girl shook her head.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do about you, 
Yoiko.&quot;

	&quot;Shut up, Red!&quot;  Yoiko yelled.  &quot;We&#39;ve got to dig 
him out!&quot;

	&quot;Relax, lovergirl.  While you were crying over 
stickboy there, I got one of the workmen at the school to 
dig him up.  Let&#39;s go.&quot;

	As they walked away, Yoiko turned to look at 
Kuno.  &quot;He&#39;s even cute when he&#39;s asleep.&quot;  she said and 
blushed.

	The pigtailed girl sighed.  Oh great, now I have a 
love sick ditz on my hands, she thought.  Then she felt a 
rain drop on her forehead.

	&quot;Oh, great.  Now it&#39;s raining.&quot;  Yoiko said.  She 
turned and saw her friend change.  The red hared pigtailed 
girl was replaced by a black hared pigtailed boy.

	&quot;Let&#39;s go before we get too wet.&quot;  the boy said and 
ran in the direction of the Tendo Dojo.

	Meanwhile, at the Tendo Dojo, everyone was 
making a mad dash for the house.

	&quot;Hey, Pop!  What&#39;s the big idea, making me train all 
day?  Now it&#39;s raining so I can&#39;t do anything!&quot;  a wet 
Ranma-chan yelled.

	[If you don&#39;t exercise, you&#39;ll get weak and flabby.]  
Panda signed.

	&quot;If school&#39;s canceled, then I should be enjoying 
myself.&quot;  Ranma said after planting her foot in Panda&#39;s face.

	*Ding-Dong*

	&quot;I&#39;ll get it!&quot;  Akane yelled from the next room.

	Akane opened the door to find Ukyo with an 
umbrella in one hand and as unconscious Ryoga in the 
other.  &quot;Hi, Akane.  Is Ranma here?&quot;  she asked after setting 
Ryoga down inside the door.

	&quot;Uh...yeah.  What happened to Ryoga?&quot;  Akane 
asked.

	&quot;I don&#39;t know.  Ranma found him outside my place 
and asked me to bring him here.&quot;

	&quot;But, Ranma&#39;s been here all day.&quot;

	&quot;Well, he must have slipped out sometime.&quot;  Ukyo 
said then blushed.  &quot;Maybe he made a special trip just to see 
me.&quot;  Akane looked annoyed, but decided she didn&#39;t want a 
fight...yet.

	&quot;Hey, Ucchan.&quot;  Ranma said when she saw Ukyo.

	Just then, Ryoga&#39;s eyes snapped open at the sound 
of his enemy&#39;s voice.  &quot;Ranma, you pervert!&quot;  he yelled and 
leapt at her.

	&quot;Who you calling a pervert, P-chan?&quot;  Ranma asked 
as she stepped to one side, letting Ryoga slam into the wall.

	&quot;Who&#39;s P-chan?!?&quot;  Ryoga yelled and leapt at Ranma 
again.

	&quot;What you mad at me for all of a sudden?&quot;  Ranma 
asked as Ryoga collided with her fist.

	&quot;You kissed me!!!&quot;  Ryoga yelled without thinking.

	&quot;He WHAT!!!&quot;  both Akane and Ukyo yelled, 
glaring at Ranma.

	&quot;I didn&#39;t do it!  I got an alibi!&quot;  Ranma yelled.  She 
was just glad Nabiki was out with her friends.  Even if the 
rumor wasn&#39;t true,  she would still blackmail her for it.

	&quot;Yes, Ryoga.  When did this happen?&quot;  Akane 
asked.

	&quot;Um...a little before one, I think.&quot;  Ryoga replied.

	&quot;There!  See!  I was here at the dojo then.  Right, 
Pop?&quot;

	[Yep.]  Panda signed, not bothering to look up from 
his shogi game with Soun.

	&quot;But, if you were here, then how could you have 
asked me to bring Ryoga here?&quot;  Ukyo asked, looking 
confused.

	&quot;I don&#39;t...&quot;

	*Ding-Dong*

	&quot;Now what?&quot;  Ranma asked, expecting more 
trouble.

	&quot;I&#39;ll get it.&quot;  Kasumii called from the kitchen.

	&quot;I must speak with Son-In-Law.&quot;  Cologne said as 
she hopped through the front door.

	&quot;Oh!  Hello, Cologne.&quot;  Kasumii said.  &quot;Ranma is in 
the next room.&quot;

	&quot;Son-In-Law!&quot;  Cologne yelled at Ranma when she 
saw her.  &quot;You should warn us if you get stuck in your 
cursed form!&quot;

	&quot;Wadaya mean &#39;stuck&#39;?  I ain&#39;t stuck.&quot;  Ranma said, 
sounding confused.

	&quot;Prove it.&quot;  Cologne said coldly.

	Ranma-chan got up and walked into the kitchen, and 
a few minutes later Ranma-kun walked out.  &quot;There!  You 
happy now, old ghoul!&quot;  he said.

	&quot;Why did you think that Ranma couldn&#39;t change 
back to a guy?&quot;  Akane asked.

	&quot;Because Shampoo tried to change him back earlier, 
but it didn&#39;t work.&quot;

	&quot;But I&#39;ve been here all day.  Right, Pop?&quot;  Ranma 
asked.

	[You got it!]  Panda signed.

	&quot;There&#39;s one way to solve this.&quot;  Cologne said, and 
grabbed Soun&#39;s iced tea.

	&quot;Hey!&quot;  Soun yelled and was about to grab his drink 
back when Cologne gave him the evil eye.  He sat back 
down.

	&lt;Ranma, I&#39;m going to throw this drink in your 
face.&gt;  Cologne said.

	&quot;Huh?&quot;  Ranma said.

	*Splash*

	&quot;What did you do that for?!&quot;  a wet Ranma-chan 
yelled.

	&quot;You don&#39;t speak Chinese.&quot;  Cologne replied.

	&quot;So what!&quot;  Ranma yelled.

	&quot;The Ranma in my restaurant did.&quot;  Cologne said.  
&quot;She was also acting very strange.&quot;

	&quot;Like how?&quot;  Akane asked.

	&quot;Well, she said I should call her Daughter-In-Law, 
and she kissed Mousse.&quot;

	&quot;Sounds like your girl, Ryoga.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Then that Ranma must be a real girl.&quot;  Akane said.

	&quot;But she kissed Shampoo, too.&quot;  Cologne said.

	&quot;Okay, a real twisted girl.&quot;  Akane replied.

	&quot;Ryoga, was there anything strange about the girl 
you saw?&quot;  Cologne asked.

	&quot;She kissed me!&quot;  Ryoga yelled, his anger renewed.

	Cologne hit him over the head with her staff and 
asked,  &quot;Other than that?&quot;

	&quot;Well, she acted like she didn&#39;t know me, and her 
voice was a little different.&quot;  Ryoga replied, rubbing his 
head.

	&quot;Like how?&quot;  Cologne asked.

	&quot;It was soothing and almost...seductive.&quot;  Ryoga 
blushed.

	&quot;What about your Ranma, Ukyo?&quot;  Cologne asked.

	&quot;Well, for one thing, she was with another girl.&quot;  
Ukyo replied.

	&quot;What!&quot;  Akane yelled and looked at Ranma.

	&quot;Hey!  It wasn&#39;t me, remember!&quot;  Ranma yelled.

	&quot;Relax, Akane.  The girl denied any involvement 
with Ran-chan other than friendship.&quot;  Ukyo said.

	&quot;Anything else?&quot;  Cologne asked.

	&quot;Oh!  She gave me the address of the dojo and 3000 
yen to cover a taxi for Ryoga.&quot;  Ukyo said and pulled out 
the note and money.

	&quot;Let me see that.&quot;  Akane said and grabbed the note.  
&quot;Look.  The note&#39;s initialed &#39;R. S.&#39;&quot;

	&quot;It wasn&#39;t me!&quot;  Ranma yelled.

	&quot;He&#39;s right.&quot;  Ukyo said.  &quot;The other girl kept calling 
her &#39;Red&#39;.  For her hair, I guess.&quot;

	&quot;Wait a minute.&quot;  Ranma broke in.  &quot;If she had the 
address of the dojo, then that means...&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;s coming here.&quot;  Cologne said.

	*Ding-Dong*

	&quot;I hope that&#39;s Nabiki.&quot;  Akane said with a hint of 
fear in her voice.

	&quot;Just to be safe, I&#39;ll get it.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Not without me, you&#39;re not!&quot;  Ukyo yelled and 
pulled out her combat spatula.

	&quot;Hey!  I can defend my own house, you know!&quot;  
Akane yelled and grabbed her mallet.

	&quot;Akane!  Wait!&quot;  Ryoga yelled.  &quot;I&#39;ll protect you!&quot;

	&quot;I guess someone will have to provide adult 
supervision.&quot;  Cologne said and shot an evil look at Panda 
and Soun, who never left their shogi game.  She followed 
everyone else to the front door.

	Ranma opened the door fully expecting to find a 
female version of herself.

	What she didn&#39;t expect was to find the male version 
of herself instead.

	She fainted.

	The pigtailed boy at the door didn&#39;t expect to find a 
female version of himself either.

	He fainted too.

	&quot;Ranko!&quot;  Yoiko yelled as she saw her friend 
collapse.

	&quot;Ran...KO?!?&quot;  Akane, Ukyo, and Ryoga yelled in 
unison.

	&quot;I believe you have some explaining to do, young 
lady.&quot;  Cologne told Yoiko.

	Later, after Ranma and Ranko were dragged into the 
next room, Yoiko tried to make some sense of the situation.

	&quot;Um...who is that girl and why does she look like 
Ranko&#39;s female form?&quot;  she asked.

	&quot;You tell us why he looks like Ranma&#39;s male form!&quot;  
Akane yelled.

	&quot;Where is Ranma, anyway?&quot;  Yoiko asked.

	&quot;Right there!&quot;  Akane pointed to the unconscious 
Ranma-chan.

	&quot;But...Ranma is supposed to be a boy!&quot;  Yoiko 
yelled.

	&quot;He is a boy!&quot;  Akane yelled back.  &quot;Kasumii!  Can 
we get some hot water in here?&quot;

	&quot;Oh my!&quot;  Kasumii said, almost dropping the kettle.  
&quot;Two Ranmas?&quot;

	&quot;We&#39;re trying to figure that out.&quot;  Akane said, 
grabbing the kettle.  She poured some hot water on Ranma, 
transforning him and waking him up.

	&quot;So you&#39;ve been to Jusenkyo, too.&quot;  Yoiko said to 
Ranma.

	&quot;Too?  You mean you&#39;ve been cursed?&quot;  Ranma 
asked Yoiko.

	&quot;Not me. But, Red has.&quot;  Yoiko said, pointing to 
Ranko.

	&quot;Red?  You mean he&#39;s the girl you were with at the 
restaurant earlier?&quot;  Ukyo asked.

	&quot;But, the girl at my restaurant wasn&#39;t affected by hot 
water.&quot;  Cologne said.

	&quot;Of course not.  Watch.&quot;  Yoiko grabbed the kettle 
and poured it over Ranko, changing her into a girl and 
waking her up.

	&quot;So it really was a girl who kissed me.&quot;  Ryoga said 
and blushed.

	&quot;Of course.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;But then why did you kiss Shampoo?&quot;  Cologne 
asked.

	&quot;Oh.  I&#39;m into that, too.&quot;  Ranko said offhandedly.

	&quot;...&quot;  Cologne was speechless.

	Ranko ignored the stares and said,  &quot;Well, 
introductions are in order.&quot;  She stood up.  &quot;I am Ranko 
Saotome, expert monster hunter and love goddes in 
training.&quot;  She took a bow.

	&quot;Saotome?  Ranma, is she related to you?&quot;  Akane 
asked.

	&quot;Ranma?&quot;  Ranko broke in.  &quot;You&#39;re Ranma?&quot;

	&quot;Um...Yeah.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;Brother!&quot;  she yelled and embraced him.

	&quot;Pop!&quot;  Ranma turned his head to face Panda.  &quot;I 
thought you said you didn&#39;t have any illegitimate children!&quot;

	[I don&#39;t!]  Panda signed, his attention finally torn 
from the shogi game.

	&quot;Ranma, why did you call that panda &#39;Pop&#39;?&quot;  Ranko 
asked.

	&quot;Because,&quot;  Genma said, using the kettle to change 
back.  &quot;I am his father, Genma Saotome.&quot;

	&quot;Genma?  Dad!&quot;  Ranko yelled, releasing Ranma and 
hugging Genma.

	&quot;Listen, girl,&quot;  Genma said.  &quot;I don&#39;t know who you 
are, but you are not my daughter.&quot;

	&quot;Yes I am.  I have proof.&quot;  Ranko said as she dug 
through her backpack and pulled out an envelope.

	&quot;Give me that.&quot;  Akane grabbed the envelope.  &quot;It&#39;s 
a letter.&quot;  she said.  &quot;It reads:  &#39;Dear Ranko, I have 
instructed that this letter be givin to your adopted parents so 
that they will one day give it to you.  I regret giving you up 
for adoption, but I did so to save your life.  Your father, 
Genma, planned on taking you and your twin brother, 
Ranma, on a training trip that would last years.  He planned 
on teaching his childrenin the Anything Goes School of 
Martial Arts.  While I believe this will make Ranma a better 
man, I fear that you, as a girl, would never survive the 
voyage.  Since Genma would insist on taking you with him, 
I was forced to give you up so he wouldn&#39;t find you.  He 
was away on a trip with his friend, Soun, when you and 
your brother were born, so he will assume that Ranma is his 
only child.  Be happy in your new life.  Your mother, 
Nodoka Saotome.&#39;&quot;

	&quot;So, Saotome.  It looks like your family just grew by 
one.&quot;  Soun said.

	&quot;Not really, Tendo.  Nodoka wrote that Ranko 
wouldn&#39;t get the letter untill she got adopted.&quot;  Genma said.

	&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t get adopted.  I stole that letter from my 
file when me and Yoiko ran away from the orphanage.&quot;  
Ranko said.

	&quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something?&quot;  Yoiko asked.

	&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot;  Ranko looked embarrassed.  &quot;This is 
my assistant...&quot;

	*Smack*

	&quot;Ow!  I mean partner, Yoiko Hibiki.&quot;

	&quot;Yoiko...Hibiki?&quot;  Ryoga said.

	&quot;Say, Ryoga.  Isn&#39;t your last name Hibiki?&quot;  Ukyo 
asked.

	&quot;Big Sister!&quot;  Ryoga yelled.

	&quot;Little Brother!&quot;  Yoiko yelled.

	Ryoga and Yoiko gave each other a big hug, fanged 
smiles on both their faces.  The pressure between them was 
enough to make diamonds out of coal, but they were too 
happy to notice.

	&quot;Ryoga, you never told me you had a sister.&quot;  
Ranma said.

	&quot;She disappeared when I was a baby.  We thought 
she was dead.&quot;  Ryoga answered.

	&quot;I was only two.  You can imagine what the Hibiki 
sense of direction was like at that age.&quot;  Yoiko said.  &quot;I got 
lost, and by the time I found my way back, my parents had 
moved.&quot;

	&quot;C&#39;mon, Sis!  Let&#39;s go for a walk to get 
reacquanted.&quot;  Ryoga said, and they left through the kitchen 
window.

	&quot;Do you really think we should let them leave 
together?&quot;  Ukyo asked.

	&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;They&#39;ll be back in a 
few days, and besides, they&#39;re happy.&quot;

	&quot;So, Ranko.&quot;  Akane said.  &quot;Why didn&#39;t you go to 
Nadoka&#39;s first.  After all, she would have been a lot easier to 
find than these two.&quot;

	Ranko exploded.  &quot;BECAUSE THAT BITCH 
ABANDONED ME BECAUSE I WAS A GIRL!!!  IF I 
EVER SEE HER, I&#39;LL RIP HER FUCKING HEAD 
OFF!!!&quot;

	&quot;Oh, my!  Such language!&quot;  Kasumii said, shocked 
by the outburst.

	Ranko assumed a more innocent pose.  &quot;She isn&#39;t 
here, is she?&quot;

	&quot;Uh...Nope.&quot;  Ranma answered.  &quot;Haven&#39;t seen her.  
Don&#39;t know where she is.&quot;  He lied, fearing for his mother&#39;s 
life.

	&quot;Good.&quot;  Ranko said and smiled.

	&quot;I&#39;m home!&quot;

	Suddenly Ranko found herself looking at the most 
beautiful person she had ever seen.  I&#39;m in love, she thought.  
She was across the room in a flash.  &quot;You don&#39;t know how 
happy it makes me to be in the presence of such loveliness.&quot;  
she said.

	&quot;I hardly think Akane would appreciate you hitting 
on me, Ranma.&quot;  Nabiki said.

	&quot;Um...over here, Nabiki.&quot;  Ranma said from accross 
the room.

	&quot;Huh?&quot;  Nabiki said as she looked back and forth 
between Ranma and Ranko.  &quot;Somebody explain this to 
me.&quot;

	Akane and Ukyo filled Nabiki in on the events of the 
evening.  Then Ranko explained how she was hunting a 
monster in China when she fell into the Nanniichuan.

	&quot;Then you know where it is?&quot;  Ranma asked with a 
hopeful look on his face.

	&quot;Nope.&quot;  Ranko answered.  &quot;Yoiko fished me out, 
and you know she wouldn&#39;t be able to find it again.&quot;

	&quot;We need to find a way to tell you two apart so we 
don&#39;t have any more mishaps like earlier today.&quot;  Cologne 
interrupted.

	&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  Ranma asked.

	Without a word, Cologne grabbed him and tossed 
him outside and into the pond.

	&quot;What you do that for!?&quot;  Ranma-chan yelled.

	&quot;You two look identical when you&#39;re the same 
gender.&quot;  Cologne said.

	&quot;Oh. that&#39;s no problem.&quot;  Kasumii said.  &quot;Ranko has 
green eyes and Ranma has blue eyes.&quot;

	&quot;If Ranko would have marked the spring she fell in, 
then we wouldn&#39;t have to worry about that.&quot;  Ranma said.

	&quot;You sound bitter, Bro.  Has your curse caused you 
problems?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Well...&quot;

	&quot;Ranko, baby, I think I should give you some 
background info on your brother.&quot;  Nabiki said, and 
proceeded to tell her about all the fiancees and enemies and 
other problems Ranma got since he moved in, leaving out 
the part about Nadoka at Akane&#39;s suggestion.

	&quot;I get the feeling I&#39;m going to like living here.&quot;  
Ranko said.

	&quot;Living here?&quot;  Ranma and Akane said.

	&quot;Well, you aren&#39;t going to throw me out on the 
street, are you?&quot;  Ranko asked with a pleading look in her 
eyes.  &quot;I&#39;m family, after all.&quot;

	&quot;Well, of course you can stay.&quot;  Soun said.  &quot;You&#39;re 
going to be Akane&#39;s sister-in-law one day.&quot;

	&quot;Dad!&quot;  Akane yelled.

	&quot;No arguments!&quot;

	&quot;It is time for me to leave.&quot;  Cologne said.  
&quot;Shampoo was frightened horribly by Ranko today,  and I 
must explain today&#39;s events os she will stop screaming.  
Ukyo, will you assist me?&quot;

	&quot;Aww, do I have to?&quot;  Ukyo liked the idea of a 
terrified Shampoo.

	&quot;Yes, you do.&quot;  Cologne said.

	&quot;Oh, all right.  Bye, Ranma honey.&quot;  Ukyo said and 
they left.

	&quot;Kasumii, show Ranko to the guest room.&quot;  Soun 
said.

	&quot;Yes, Father.&quot;  Kasumii said.  &quot;Come with me, 
Ranko.&quot;

	As Ranko left the room, she winked at Nabiki, who 
blushed in return.

	&quot;Here&#39;s your room.  Make yourself at home, and I&#39;ll 
call you when dinner is ready.&quot;  Kasumii said as she opened 
the door opposite of the one marked &#39;Nabiki&#39;.

	&quot;Kasumii?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Yes, Ranko?&quot;

	&quot;Can we talk?&quot;

	&quot;Of course.&quot;  Kasumii sat on the edge of the bed and 
motioned for Ranko to join her.  &quot;What do you want to talk 
about?&quot;

	&quot;Well, Nabiki said that Ranma could have gotten 
engaged to any ot the Tendo girls.  So why did you and 
Nabiki elect Akane?&quot;

	&quot;There were several reasons, but the main reason 
was that we thought that having a fiancee would help Akane 
get over her...unfavorable...attitude about boys.&quot;

	&quot;So, does she like Ranma?&quot;

	&quot;Well, they do fight often, but I think they like each 
other.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s nice.&quot;  Ranko said with a smile.  &quot;You 
probably have a boyfriend, anyway, so you couldn&#39;t marry 
him.&quot;

	&quot;Oh my, no.  I don&#39;t have a boyfriend.&quot;  Kasumii 
said.

	&quot;Really?  No one you like?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Well, there is someone.&quot;  Kasumii blushed.  &quot;But 
he&#39;s never asked me out on a date or anything.&quot;

	&quot;Why don&#39;t you ask him out?&quot;

	&quot;I couldn&#39;t.&quot;  Kasumii looked positively flustered.  
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be proper.&quot;

	&quot;If you say so.&quot;  Ranko said, trying not to laugh at 
Kasumii&#39;s old fashioned attitude.

	&quot;Besides, I don&#39;t think I could get up the courage to 
ask him.&quot;

	&quot;Okay, let&#39;s change the subject.&quot;  Ranko said.  
&quot;What about Nabiki?&quot;

	&quot;What about Nabiki?&quot;  Kasumii said, not 
understanding the question.

	&quot;Does she have a girl...&quot;  Ranko stopped herself.  &quot;I 
mean...boyfriend?&quot;

	&quot;I have seen her with a boy from her class.&quot;  
Kasumii said.

	Ranko lost her smile.  &quot;Really, who?&quot;

	&quot;Um...Tatewaki Kuno in his name, I think.&quot;  
Kasumii replied.

	&quot;Kuno?&quot;  Ranko perked up a bit.  &quot;Tall guy.  Into 
kendo.  Speaks in poetry.  Right?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, that&#39;s him.&quot;

	&quot;I saw him earlier.  He seemed to be intrested in me, 
thinking I was Ranma.&quot;

	&quot;Ranma?&quot;  Kasumii said, looking shocked.  &quot;I never 
knew.  I always thought he was intrested in Akane.&quot;

	&quot;Akane, too?&quot;  Ranko&#39;s grin widened.  &quot;Well, it 
seems as if Nabiki is available.&quot;

	&quot;Why, do you know someone?&quot;  Kasumii asked with 
an innocent smile.

	&quot;Uh...maybe.&quot;  Ranko replied, amazed that Kasumii 
hadn&#39;t figured out where the conversation was leading.  &quot;I&#39;ll 
have to look.&quot;

	&quot;Well, tell me if you find someone.&quot;  Kasumii got 
up.  &quot;Dinner should be ready in about an hour.&quot;  she said 
and left.

	Ranko laid back on the bed and stared at the ceiling.  
She knew that just because Nabiki didn&#39;t have a boyfriend 
didn&#39;t mean she was intrested in girls.  And even if she was, 
she might already have a girlfriend, in which case Ranko 
wouldn&#39;t interfere.  But she had a chance, and a chance was 
all she wanted.

	Later at the dinner table, Ranko took a seat next to 
Nabiki and prepared to dig in.  After all, the only food she 
had all day was the bowl of ramen at the Cat Cafe, and she 
only ate half of that before Shampoo forced her to flee.  She 
took her chopsticks and reached to grab a piece of food, 
which was snached up by Genma.

	&quot;Hey!&quot;  she yelled.

	&quot;If you want to be my daughter, you&#39;re going to 
have to be quicker than that.&quot;  he replied.

	She made another grab, but was stopped by Ranma 
this time.

	&quot;Hey!&quot;

	&quot;Sorry, Sis.&quot;  he said.  &quot;If I leave you an opening, 
the old man will get it.&quot;

	Ranko frowned and placed her palms together, 
chanting under her breath.

	&quot;Ranko, we aren&#39;t that formal here.&quot;  Akane said.  
&quot;You don&#39;t have to say a prayer before eating.&quot;

	Ranko gave no answer.  Instead she took her hands 
and placed them on Ranma and Genma&#39;s foreheads.  They 
froze like statues.  She smiled and proceeded to fill her 
plate.

	&quot;How did you do that?&quot;  Akane asked in shock.

	&quot;Oh, that?&quot;  Ranko said as she started to grab the 
food off her father and brother&#39;s plates.  &quot;Just a little magic.  
I don&#39;t use it too often.&quot;

	&quot;Where did you learn magic?&quot;  Akane asked.

	&quot;Mostly from Urd, but I pick up a new spell every 
once in a while.&quot;

	&quot;Who&#39;s Urd?&quot;  Akane asked, wondering who could 
teach such an amazing technique.

	&quot;Urd&#39;s my patron goddess.&quot;  Ranko replied.

	&quot;Okay.&quot;  Akane said, not believing what she just 
heard.  Goddesses weren&#39;t real were they?

	&quot;Ranko, could you fix them?&quot;  Kasumii asked 
politely.  &quot;I don&#39;t think that they would appreciate being 
frozen for very long.&quot;

	&quot;Oh, sure thing.&quot;  Ranko said and snapped her 
fingers.  Genma and Ranma unfroze and started to fight 
over food that was no longer there.

	&quot;Hey!  What happened?&quot;  Ranma asked as his 
chopsticks grabbed at thin air.

	&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to know.&quot;  Genma said as he 
stared at his empty plate.

	&quot;It appears that your daughter is full of suprises, 
Saotome.&quot;  Soun said and pointed to Ranko eating from a 
plate with enough food for three people.  Ranma gave her a 
dirty look.

	&quot;What?&quot;  Ranko said between bites.  &quot;Yoiko may be 
great with a campfire, but nothing beats a home cooked 
meal.&quot;  Eventually, she took sympathy on her newly found 
family and sacrificed some of her mountian of food.

	After dinner, Ranko sat on the porch taking in the 
night air.  The storm had passed and the sky was filled with 
stars.&quot;

	&quot;Mind if I join you?&quot;

	Ranko&#39;s heart skipped a beat when she realized who 
it was.  &quot;I can&#39;t think of a single person I&#39;d like next to me 
more than you.&quot;

	Nabiki sat next to her.  &quot;You know, I don&#39;t think my 
father would like the way you&#39;ve been coming on to me.&quot;

	&quot;You don&#39;t seem the type to let other people dictate 
your life.&quot;  Ranko replied with a grin.  &quot;Besides, if I&#39;m going 
to be a love goddess, I need to keep in practice.&quot;

	&quot;You really take this goddess business seriously.&quot;  
Nabiki said.  &quot;Akane thinks it&#39;s a load of crap.&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;ll change her tune tomarrow, when I have one 
of the goddesses drop off some of my things.&quot;

	&quot;One of the goddesses?&quot;  Nabiki said.  &quot;You mean 
there&#39;s more than one?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.  Urd and her two sisters live with a college 
student up my Nekomi Tech.&quot;

	&quot;How does a family of goddesses end up living with 
a college student?&quot;

	&quot;Long story.&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;Hey, Nabiki.  Can I ask 
you a question?&quot;

	&quot;Shoot.&quot;

	&quot;Well, me and Kasumii were talking, and she 
mentioned that you were seeing a guy named Kuno...&quot;

	&quot;Jealous?&quot;  Nabiki asked, and received a blush from 
Ranko.

	&quot;No.  It&#39;s just that me and Yoiko ran into him earlier, 
and she seemed pretty fond of him.&quot;

	&quot;Well, you can tell her not to worry about me.  I 
consider Kuno a client and nothing more.&quot;

	&quot;Client?  In what business?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Information, mostly.&quot;

	&quot;What kind of information?&quot;

	&quot;Akane and Ranma-chan.&quot;  Nabiki&#39;s eyes lit up.  
&quot;Although, it will probably be Akane and you, now.&quot;

	&quot;If I stay.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;Not planning on leaving so soon, are you?&quot;  Nabiki 
asked.

	&quot;Why?  Want me to stay?&quot;  Ranko asked back.

	&quot;Sure.  If today is any indicaton, things will be a lot 
more intresting with you around.&quot;  Nabiki replied.

	&quot;Thanks, Nabiki.&quot;  Ranko said and rested her head 
on Nabiki&#39;s shoulder.

	&quot;Uh, Ranko?&quot;  Nabiki asked with a nervous tone in 
her voice.

	&quot;Yes?&quot;  Ranko replied.  Damn, she thought.  I 
moved too fast for her.

	&quot;How much does being a goddess and monster 
hunter pay.&quot;  Nabiki asked with a predatory look on her 
face.

	Ranko sighed.

	Later that night, Ranko laid awake in her bed.

	I didn&#39;t think things would go so smoothly, she 
thought.  I expected them to be skeptical of my claims, but 
instead they welcomed me with open arms.  Dad and Ranma 
treat me as if I&#39;d been with them all my life.  Soun accepts 
me as part of his family.  Kasumii makes me feel what it 
must be like to have a mother.  But I suppose anybody 
could do a better job than my real mother.  Akane and I 
could grow to be good friends. And Nabiki...

	Ranko smiled.  Well, she thought.  I hope I can be 
more than just friends with Nabiki.

	*Knock-Knock*

	&quot;Who is it?&quot;  Ranko asked, wondering who could be 
up this late.

	&quot;It&#39;s Nabiki.  Can I come in?&quot;

	Ranko&#39;s heart jumped.  &quot;O-of course.  Come right 
in.&quot;

	Nabiki entered, looked at Ranko, and giggled.

	&quot;What?&quot;  Ranko asked, looking confused.

	&quot;Well, I knew you and Ranma had the same taste in 
clothes.  But I had no idea you wore boxers and a muscle-
tee to bed.&quot;  Nabiki answered and giggled some more.

	&quot;Let&#39;s just say a girl in boxers looks better than a 
guy in panties.&quot;

	Nabiki broke out in laughter.  &quot;I see your point.&quot;  
she managed to get out.

	&quot;So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit.&quot;  
Ranko asked.

	Nabiki became serious.  &quot;Kasumii told me that you 
wanted to know why she or I didn&#39;t choose to be engaged 
to Ranma.  Well, I almost did.&quot;

	&quot;Huh?&quot;  Ranko didn&#39;t like where this conversation 
was going.

	&quot;He&#39;s one of the most handsome men I&#39;ve ever 
seen.&quot;  Nabiki answered.

	&quot;So, you&#39;re saying you&#39;re attracted to him?&quot;  Ranko 
asked, afraid of the answer.

	&quot;Yes.  Him and her.  He&#39;s also one of the most 
beautiful women I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;  Nabiki answered.

	Ranko was crushed.  &quot;So why didn&#39;t you take him 
for yourself?&quot;

	&quot;Because his personality turns me off.&quot;  she said.  &quot;I 
mean, how would he react if I did this.&quot;  She reached out 
and grabbed Ranko&#39;s breast.

	Ranko gasped as she felt her nipples harden under 
her shirt.

	&quot;Or this?&quot;  Nabiki leaned forward and kissed Ranko, 
running her tounge across the girls teeth.

	Ranko pulled back.  &quot;Nabiki.  Not that I&#39;m not 
enjoying this.  Because I really, really am.  But, why do you 
want me all of a sudden?&quot;

	&quot;Because,&quot;  Nabiki said as she pulled Ranko&#39;s shirt 
over her head.  &quot;You have all the physical attributes that I 
like about Ranma, and none of the mental ones I don&#39;t like.&quot;

	&quot;Like what?&quot;  Ranko asked as she unbottoned 
Nabiki&#39;s top.

	&quot;Mmm.&quot;  Nabiki moaned as Ranko started to caress 
her breasts.  &quot;You don&#39;t hide your true feelings and you 
don&#39;t judge people.&quot;  She pulled off her pajame bottoms.  
&quot;Besides, I think I love you.&quot;

	&quot;I fell in love the moment I saw you.&quot;  Ranko said.  
Then she noticed that Nabiki was giggling again.  &quot;Now 
what?&quot;

	&quot;Sorry.&quot;  Nabiki tried to control herself.  &quot;I just 
realized that we won&#39;t have to worry about getting our 
clothes mixed up in the morning.&quot;

	Ranko looked down to see Nabiki clad in only a pair 
of blue panties while she ws still in her yellow and blue 
boxers.  &quot;Well, I guess we&#39;ll just have to get rid of this 
distraction, won&#39;t we?&quot;  She said as she pulled off her 
shorts, revealing a patch of red pubic hair.  She tossed the 
boxers aside and jumped on the bed.

	&quot;We can&#39;t have just one of us naked, now can we?&quot;  
Nabiki said as she took off her panties, uncovering her own 
brown pubic hair.  She joined Ranko on the bed.

	Ranko pulled the taller girls head down and gave her 
a passionate kiss, their tounges exploring each other&#39;s 
mouths.  She rolled Nabiki on her back and trailed kisses 
down her neck and lower, settling on her left nipple.  As she 
began to suck, she raised her hand to caress the right breast, 
gently flickig the nipple with her thumb.

	Nabiki moaned at the sensations Ranko was 
producing.  She reached out and grabbed the redhead&#39;s 
breasts, squeezing them and feeling the rock hard nipples 
against her palms.  She begain to rub them in circles.

	After basking in the attention she was receiving for a 
few moments, she tool her hands and ran them along 
Nabiki&#39;s sides, past her hips and down her legs.  Reaching 
her knees, Ranko reversed direction and slid her hands up 
her inner thighs.  Nabiki moaned and instinctively parted her 
legs.  Ranko smiled and gave her slit a slow lick.

	Nabiki gasped at the new contact.  She sat up and 
ran har hands down Ranko&#39;s back, coming to rest on her 
ass.  She massaged the soft curves for a few moments, 
causing Ranko to reflexively raise her butt in the air.  Nabiki 
took advantage of this and slid a hand around to her front.  
Feeling Ranko&#39;s wetness, Nabiki slid a finger into her 
opening.

	Ranko shuttered at the intrusion.  She returned the 
favor, inserting a finger into Nabiki, but was stopped after a 
short distance.  She pulled out her finger as she realized that 
Nabiki was still a virgin.

	Noticing the loss of sensation, Nabiki figured she 
must not be doing a good enough job.  She started pumping 
her fingers in and out of Ranko, rubbing her cllit in small 
circles with the other hand.  Her fingers got sticky as Ranko 
became even wetter.

	Ranko almost screamed as Nabiki&#39;s onslaught hit 
her.  Taking the hint, she resumed her work by gently 
sucking on Nabiki&#39;s clit  She took a finger and traced just 
inside the opening.

	Nabiki shook as she felt the sensations return.  She 
added a second to the to the one inside Ranko&#39;s canal, 
feeling the tightness grip it.  She stopped rubbing the clit 
with her other hand and instead started pinching it between 
her thumb and forefinger.

	Ranko was determined to bring Nabiki off first, but 
she knew she couldn&#39;t last much longer.  Resisting the urge 
to thrust her fingers deep into Nabiki, Ranko stopped 
sucking on her clit and instead started to gently bite.  She 
felt Nabiki&#39;s body start to quiver under her.

	Nabiki bit her lip as she came, her spasms causing 
her to thrust her fingers hard into Ranko&#39;s passage.  She saw 
the girl&#39;s body shake as her fingers were soaked by Ranko&#39;s 
orgasm.

	After the feelings subsided, Ranko slid up and gave 
Nabiki a kiss.  Nabiki tasted herself on Ranko&#39;s lips.  Ranko 
then grabbed Nabiki&#39;s hands and licked them clean of her 
own fluids.  Then they embraced and held each other for 
several moments.

	&quot;Um, Nabiki?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	&quot;Yes, Ranko?&quot;

	&quot;Are you a lesbian?&quot;

	&quot;You wait until NOW to ask that?&quot;  Nabiki said, 
faintly annoyed by the absurdity of the question.

	&quot;I mean, have you had sex with other women?&quot;  
Ranko asked bluntly.

	&quot;No, you were my first.  Why?&quot;  Nabiki asked.

	&quot;Well, I used to have one of these,&quot;  She inserted a 
finger into Nabiki and gently ran it across her hymen.  &quot;And 
I lost it to another girl.  While I don&#39;t regret that, I&#39;ve often 
wondered if it would have been better if I lost my virginity 
to a man.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.  What&#39;s you&#39;re point?&quot;  Nabiki asked.

	&quot;The night is far from over, so you have a choice to 
make.  We could continue the way we were, and I could 
give you greater pleasure than you&#39;ve experienced before. 
Or,&quot;  She gestured to the door.  &quot;I could go out that door 
and come back a man, giving you a completely different 
kind of pleasure.&quot;

	&quot;But, won&#39;t it hurt?&quot;  Nabiki asked nervously.

	&quot;There will be pain either way, but the pleasure is 
well worth it.&quot;  Ranko replied.  &quot;So, what will it be?&quot;

	&quot;Ranko, I love you.  All of you.  Including your 
male half.&quot;  Nabiki answered and kissed her.

	&quot;Okay, then.  I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;  Ranko said and 
headed toward the door.

	&quot;Ranko?&quot;  Nabiki said.

	&quot;Yes, my love?&quot;  Ranko said, getting a blush from 
Nabiki&#39;s already flushed face.

	&quot;I know it&#39;s late, but it&#39;s still not a good idea to walk 
around naked in a house full of people.&quot;

	&quot;Oh!&quot;  Ranko said and blushed.  &quot;I forgot we 
weren&#39;t alone in the house.&quot;  she said as she grabbed the 
boxers and shirt, ignoring the giggles from Nabiki.

	&quot;Sorry.&quot;  Nabiki said with a grin.  &quot;Now go, and 
hurry back before I start without you.&quot;  She watched as 
Ranko left.

	&quot;I&#39;m back!&quot;  Ranko-kun called out in a much deeper voice as he returned.

	&quot;What took you so long?&quot;  Nabiki asked.

	&quot;I had to dry off, okay?&quot;  Ranko said.  &quot;I mean, you 
didn&#39;t want me to come back dripping wet, did you?&quot;

	&quot;Why not?  You were dripping wet when you left.&quot;

	&quot;Well,&quot;  Ranko said as he climbed into bed.  &quot;I seem 
to have fixed that problem and caused another.&quot;

	&quot;I see.&quot;  Nabiki said, looking down at the bulge in 
his shorts.  &quot;And I expected those to fit better when you 
were a guy.&quot;

	&quot;Well, like you said, &#39;We can&#39;t have just one of us 
naked, now can we?&#39;&quot;  Ranko said and pulled off his shirt 
and shorts.

	&quot;Wow!&quot;  Nabiki gasped as Ranko&#39;s erection sprang 
into veiw.  &quot;Are they all that big?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m above average, but I&#39;ve seen bigger.&quot;  Ranko 
answered.

	&quot;You realize a real man wouldn&#39;t have admitted 
that?&quot;  Nabiki said and grabbed his member, feeling how 
hard it was.

	&quot;So now I have to prove my manhood?&quot;  he asked, 
and moaned as she stroked his shaft.

	&quot;I think we&#39;ll let your manhood prove itself.&quot;  she 
said and quickly took him in her mouth.

	Ranko moaned as she gently sucked on the head of 
his penis.  He placed his hands on the back of her head and 
gently pushed, forcing more of himself into her mouth.

	Nabiki took the hint and started to bob her head up 
and down, each time taking in a little more of his erection.  
When she couldn&#39;t take anymore, she started to suck more 
forcefully and ran her tounge back and forth.

	Ranko grunted and exploded in her mouth.  He 
collapsed back on the bed as his orgasm subsided and he felt 
Nabiki release his softening member.

	Nabiki gulped as she swallowed Ranko&#39;s seed and 
crawled up to lay next to him.

	&quot;Well, am I a man?&quot;  Ranko asked and kissed her, 
reaching his tounge in to lick up the few drops of semen 
that remained.

	&quot;I don&#39;t think a real man would be eager to taste 
sperm, even if it is his own.&quot;  Nabiki said after breaking the 
kiss.

	&quot;It&#39;s an acquired taste.&quot;  Ranko said.

	&quot;I&#39;ll bet.  Well, on with the main event.&quot;  Nabiki said 
and started to rub Ranko&#39;s penis, it&#39;s hardness rapidly 
returning under her fingers.

	Ranko rolled Nabiki on her back and lowered his 
head to suck on her right nipple.  He reached one hand up 
to caress the other breast while the other hand went down 
to play with her clit.

	Nabiki moaned as the wave of feeling washed over 
her.  She reached out and ran a hand across the hard 
muscles of Ranko&#39;s chest.

	Ranko ran a hand across Nabiki&#39;s slit to find out how 
wet she was.  Satisfied, he decided that it was time.  He 
spread her legs and placed his member at her opening.  
Gently, he pushed until the head pressed aganst her hymen.  
&quot;Ready?&quot;  he asked.

	Nabiki nodded, her need for more pleasure blocking 
out any fear she might have had.

	Ranko thrust forward hard, rupturing her barrier and 
driving himself deep inside her.  He looked down to see a 
tear roll down Nabiki&#39;s cheek.  &quot;You gonna be okay?&quot;  he 
asked.

	&quot;It still hurts a bit.&quot;  Nabiki said, the pain clear in her 
voice.

	&quot;Shh.&quot;  Ranko quieted her.  &quot;I&#39;ll make it better.&quot;  He 
pulled out untill only the tip of his erection was inside her 
and thrust into her again.  He pulled out and thrust again, 
setting up a slow rhythm.

	Nabiki gasped as each thrust washed away the pain 
and replacing it with pleasure.  She started to raise her hips, 
matching Ranko stroke for stroke.

	After a few minutes, Ranko felt himself on the edge.  
He sped up his up his rhythm, determined to bring Nabiki 
off first.

	Nabiki felt his pace quicken and moaned. feeling the 
sensations rapidly reaching their peak.  She cried out as she 
came, soaking Ranko&#39;s shaft with her honey.

	Feeling Nabiki&#39;s body spasm around him was enough 
to send Ranko over the edge.  He gave one final thrust and 
came deep in her.  When his orgasm subsided, he collapsed 
on the bed next to Nabiki.

	Nabiki leaned over and gave Ranko a loving kiss.  
They stared into each others eyes for what seemed like an 
eternity.

	&quot;Well, do you like me better as a boy or a girl?&quot;  
Ranko asked.

	&quot;I think I&#39;ll have to do more in depth research before 
I answer that.&quot;  Nabiki replied.

	&quot;Not tonight, I hope.  I&#39;m exhausted.&quot;  he said.

	&quot;So am I.&quot;  she said.  &quot;Wait here.&quot;  Nabiki got up 
and left the room.

	And she tells me to get dressed before I leave, 
Ranko thought.

	A few minutes later, Nabiki returned holding a glass 
and a towel.

	&quot;What&#39;s that for?&quot;  Ranko asked.

	*Splash*

	&quot;Ow!  That&#39;s hot!&quot;  Ranko-chan yelped.

	&quot;Sorry.&quot;  Nabiki said and handed her the towel.

	&quot;Why do you want me as a girl?&quot;  Ranko asked.  &quot;I 
thought we were done for the night.&quot;

	&quot;With sex, yes.&quot;  Nabiki answered.  &quot;But you are 
much softer like this.&quot;  She hopped into bed and cuddled up 
next to the girl.

	&quot;I think I see your point.&quot;  Ranko said and flipped 
the light switch by the bed.  &quot;Good night.&quot;

	&quot;Good night.&quot;  Nabiki said.  &quot;Ranko?&quot;

	&quot;Yes?&quot;

	&quot;I love you.&quot;

	&quot;I love you, too, Nabiki.&quot;

------------------------------------------------

Well that&#39;s it for my first fanfic attempt.

I know it&#39;s long and it drags (that&#39;s what she said) but I 
didn&#39;t want Ranko to just show up at the dojo and than have 
Nabiki jump her.

Send any comments  Avoid flames 
though, because they will only encourage me.

I&#39;ll start writing the next chapter after I get a few responses 
to this one.  Speaking of which:
