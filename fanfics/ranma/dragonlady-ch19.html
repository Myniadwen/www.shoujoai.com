<h1>Dragon Lady of Macross (part 19 of 30)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a>

<a href="../ranma/dragonlady-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>February 2010...

Ranma, Vicki, Akane, and even Max were practically dog-piled by their 
tearfully happy squadron mates as they climbed out of the commandeered 
battle pod. After about ten minutes of hugging and greetings, their 
reunion was cut short by the Ex-POW&#39;s being hustled off to a debriefing 
with the brass.

The five found themselves seated along one side of a conference table 
with Captain Gloval seated at the head of the table and the senior brass 
being seated opposite Lisa and the others. Gloval had begun the meeting 
by informing the pilots that they had all been promoted. Then he 
presented them all with the Solar Cross for heroism, the highest award 
available in the RDF Space Arm.

Lisa began the debriefing by telling them of what they saw as they came 
out of the fold. She described the ships surrounding the Zentradi home 
base and then the ships they had seen inside the enemy home base. She 
then filled them in on the interrogation and the conclusions they had 
drawn about Protoculture.

Gloval ran some computer estimations based on the observations Lisa and 
the others had made. The computer returned a shocking estimate of four 
million ships. Clearly, the officers seated across from them were not 
taking this seriously and they made snide remarks and jokes.

&quot;That&#39;s pure fantasy,&quot; Commander Jenkins of the intelligence arm said, 
tilting his seat back.

&quot;Yeah, and did you see any little green men?&quot; Major Gregor chuckled 
patronizingly.

The others laughed uproariously. The laughs were suddenly silenced by 
the ring of steel. All eyes were on a glowing blue Ranma as she pulled 
her fist from the hole she&#39;d just made in the steel surface of the 
table.

&quot;What&#39;s pure fantasy, you rear-echelon jackass?&quot; Ranma ground out 
between her clenched teeth. &quot;That a highly advanced interstellar warrior 
race can snuff out our little race like a candle in a hurricane? Or that 
we actually have a chance against them in an all out war? Get your head 
outta your fucking ass, you arrogant moron. Just because you didn&#39;t see 
it doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;

&quot;Commander Saotome, STAND DOWN!&quot; Gloval commanded. Ranma&#39;s cold, glowing 
blue gaze shifted to Gloval. Gloval had to call on every bit of his 
willpower to meet the gaze steadily without flinching, but he managed 
it.

&quot;Sorry, Sir,&quot; Ranma said, taking her seat as the glow faded.

&quot;Now, as the Commander so succinctly put it,&quot; Gloval continued, &quot;this is 
a very grave matter that we cannot afford not to take seriously.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t mean you believe this load of bunk, do you?&quot; Maistroff 
demanded.

&quot;Were you there, Colonel Maistroff?&quot; Gloval asked, giving Ranma a 
warning glace. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen two more reliable officers than 
Commanders Hayes and Saotome. Their story is backed up by three other 
officers who all have excellent records. Furthermore, to disbelieve that 
these invaders do not have far more potential than they have shown thus 
far would be extremely foolish. You have been on this ship for the last 
year. You know that the only explanation for the fact that we have 
survived this long is that they want this ship intact. Don&#39;t be a fool, 
Colonel. The fate of the human race is at stake here. This is no time 
for wishful thinking or denial of the threat. The high command must be 
apprised of this situation.&quot;

&quot;Very well, Captain Gloval,&quot; Maistroff said. &quot;I&#39;ll send a coded message 
at once.&quot;

&quot;No, you will not, Colonel Maistroff,&quot; Gloval said flatly.

&quot;What?&quot; the shocked man asked.

&quot;You will not send a message because this information is too important 
to be transmitted and potentially blocked,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;We are going 
back to Earth.&quot;

&quot;What? Are you mad?&quot; Maistroff demanded. &quot;We&#39;ll never make it through 
that blockade.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Colonel?&quot; Gloval growled. &quot;A minute ago the Zentradi 
didn&#39;t present a threat worthy of your concern, now you don&#39;t believe we 
can break out of a simple blockade?&quot;

&quot;I...you...&quot; Maistroff sputtered then gave up.

&quot;As for you five,&quot; Gloval said with a smile. &quot;You won&#39;t be leaving the 
ship for the time being. You have all earned a little rest and 
relaxation. You are dismissed.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma was sitting on the couch in male form wearing a pair of black and 
red silk boxers when Lisa entered the room. Ranma&#39;s eyes traveled avidly 
over her graceful form clad only in a pair of emerald green lacy thong 
panties and a matching bra. She strutted sensually across the room until 
she stood before Ranma. Seductively she climbed up on the couch, 
straddling his lap, and slid her breasts enticingly up his hard muscled 
chest.

&quot;Well, now, Mister Saotome, you started something a while ago and now 
you need to finish it,&quot; Lisa purred as she sat back a bit with her hands 
on his shoulders.

&quot;Lisa, we need to talk,&quot; Ranma said as he placed his hands comfortable 
on her hips. &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about it ever since the interrogation. 
We never talked about having a family. I know we are both pretty career 
oriented but I would like to have kids someday. How do you feel?&quot;

&quot;Do you want me to go off the Depo?&quot; Lisa grinned in answer. Ranma 
smiled.

&quot;Well, I think it might be a little soon for that,&quot; Ranma chuckled. &quot;We 
are in the middle of a war, ya know.&quot;

&quot;That hasn&#39;t stopped the civilians in Macross City,&quot; Lisa pointed out.

&quot;True, but how could we handle it?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;We are both so busy 
with our jobs. Would we have time for kids? What about my...condition? I 
couldn&#39;t be a father to them. Do we really want to raise kids as two 
mothers?&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Lisa asked. &quot;Lesbian couples do it all the time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but you know the kids get picked on,&quot; Ranma pointed out.

&quot;Ranma, I have a very hard time seeing any kids of ours getting picked 
on,&quot; Lisa giggled. &quot;The other kids would be too afraid of getting beaten 
up.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Ranma conceded. &quot;But would we be good parents? I mean, I 
certainly didn&#39;t have any good examples to draw from.&quot;

&quot;I completely understand your fear,&quot; Lisa sighed. &quot;For some reason, when 
I was planning my life out, kids never occurred to me. Not even with 
Karl. How would I balance my career and my child? It&#39;s been easy with 
you because we are both dedicated and we respect that in each other. 
With kids, it would be different. They&#39;d be dependant on us for 
everything. But, you know what? Other career officers handle it. Why 
can&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;But when should we start?&quot;

&quot;Ranma, I think you should know, I&#39;m terrified every time you go out on 
a mission that you won&#39;t come back,&quot; Lisa admitted. &quot;I love you so much 
that I&#39;d die if I lost you. My career may be my purpose in life, but you 
are my reason for living. You know it&#39;s true. If I had your baby, then 
even if, god forbid, I lost you, I would have a little piece of you to 
hold to me. I think we should start trying immediately. We&#39;ve been gone 
from the SDF-1 for a month and I&#39;m due for my next shot of Depo. So I 
should be able to get pregnant soon.&quot; Ranma looked at her, his eyes wide 
in shock.

&quot;But...we aren&#39;t even married yet,&quot; Ranma protested.

&quot;Then we should take care of that detail right away,&quot; Lisa grinned. &quot;The 
Captain could do it. There&#39;s also a minister among the civilians, and 
the city officials, notary publics and the like. I think given your 
condition the Captain would be a better choice. I want to give my vows 
to my husband as well as my wife.&quot;

&quot;Not like I can be much of a husband,&quot; Ranma quipped.

&quot;My husband will only have one duty,&quot; Lisa grinned mischievously. &quot;It&#39;s 
one that he has proven he can handle with extreme expertise...fucking me 
senseless. My wife has proven herself more than exceptional at 
satisfying my needs in all other aspects.&quot;

&quot;I knew it,&quot; Ranma quipped jokingly. &quot;You just love me for my body.&quot;

&quot;Damn straight,&quot; Lisa grinned wickedly and ground herself into him a 
little. &quot;Now, is that a cluster bomb in your shorts, or are you just 
happy to see me?&quot;

&quot;Oh it&#39;s a cluster bomb alright,&quot; Ranma chuckled, &quot;and it&#39;s very happy 
to see you.&quot;

Ranma pulled her to him and proceeded to perform his husbandly duties 
with great care and attention to detail.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Hey there, Rickhead,&quot; Ranma said as she walked up to Rick, who was 
staring off into space from the large window of the Officer&#39;s Lounge.

&quot;Oh, hey Commander,&quot; Rick said in a subdued tone. &quot;Congratulations on 
your safe return and promotion.&quot;

&quot;Gee, you really know how to make a girl feel like you&#39;re glad to see 
her, dontcha?&quot; Ranma teased.

&quot;I guess not,&quot; Rick replied glumly.

&quot;Okay, what wrong?&quot; Ranma inquired, taking a seat and looking expectant.

&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; Rick said, but Ranma just raised an eyebrow and gave him 
a look. &quot;Okay, it&#39;s Minmei. She hasn&#39;t had much time for me anymore 
since she started her singing career. I suppose I have you to blame for 
that, but I guess it would have happened eventually. I just feel like 
we&#39;re growing apart.&quot;

&quot;Rick, she&#39;s sixteen,&quot; Ranma pointed out. &quot;You&#39;re what, twenty now? I&#39;m 
not saying there&#39;s anything wrong with that, but you have to keep in 
mind, she&#39;s still a kid. You&#39;ve grown up a lot since Pluto. You&#39;ve had 
to. I&#39;ve seen you mature from a loudmouth punk with no common sense into 
a promising young officer. You&#39;ve become much more responsible with 
pilots under your command that look to you for leadership. Minmei hasn&#39;t 
had to deal with the harsh realities of the war like you have. She still 
has her innocence. If you love her, you have to be patient with her and 
explain to her what&#39;s on your mind.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, Commander?&quot; Rick asked.

&quot;Look, your job is just as demanding on your time as hers is on hers,&quot; 
Ranma explained. &quot;In fact, it&#39;s probably worse since you might have to 
jump up in the middle of a romantic moment to answer a scramble. Lisa 
and I are the same way. Our responsibilities don&#39;t allow us to see as 
much of each other as we would like. The point is, in the time you do 
have, you have to make it count. You have to communicate clearly and 
make your feelings known. Don&#39;t even think about telling her to make 
more time for you because that would force her to choose between you and 
her dreams. Just tell her what&#39;s on your mind in a non-demanding way.&quot;

&quot;But every time I try to talk to her she gets distracted by something,&quot; 
Rick complained. &quot;Do you think you could talk to her for me? I just want 
to know where she stands. I could deal with us being too busy to see 
each other if I just knew where she stood.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;m not going to be your go between, but I&#39;ll 
talk to her and suggest that maybe she needs to clarify things with you. 
You realize that she may not have even considered how she feels, don&#39;t 
you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I get that impression,&quot; Rick said sadly. &quot;But I really appreciate 
you making the effort to talk to her.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma looked at Lisa who smiled and squeezed her hand reassuringly. 
Opening the door to the Rose Garden, they walked in to address the 
squadron.

&quot;Ladies,&quot; Lisa addressed, &quot;what you will hear in this room today has 
been ordered by the captain to be classified information and repeating 
it is, in fact, a court marshalable offense. Most of you know about what 
we will be disclosing to you today. Those of you that don&#39;t, please keep 
an open mind and look to your squadron sisters for guidance because what 
you will learn today may be very hard for some to come to grips with.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve have a secret,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;ve kept it for 7 years but lately a 
couple of incidents have caused it to be revealed. I&#39;m tired of 
explaining it to people after they already feel angry and betrayed so I 
think I must reveal it to all of you since we must maintain a high level 
of trust with one another. I&#39;m trusting you to keep this secret for me 
as it would end my career if it was general knowledge.

&quot;First I&#39;d like all of you that know what I&#39;m about to disclose and 
accept me to raise your hands,&quot; Ranma requested.

The five original Roses plus Akane and Max raised their hands. The four 
newer pilots looked around themselves, noting that they were, in fact, 
in the minority.

&quot;What you&#39;re about to hear will sound unbelievable, something straight 
out of the pages of a fantasy story, but by the time you leave this room 
your world view will be changed forever,&quot; Ranma continued. &quot;Rest 
assured, that this is the truth and it&#39;ll be demonstrated.&quot;

&quot;Gee, Mom, with a build up like that, you aren&#39;t planning on telling us 
you&#39;re the Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon are you? Mom, are you telling us 
you&#39;re a pretty sailor suited soldier for love and justice?&quot; Midori 
giggled and everyone laughed, breaking the tension.

&quot;Well, you found me out,&quot; Ranma said, gaining control of her laughter as 
the others that knew were still in hysterics. &quot;I don&#39;t know about the 
rest, but you could say that I&#39;m a sort of magical girl.&quot; This caused 
more laughter from those that knew and gave the ones that didn&#39;t pause.

Thus, Ranma began to explain about Jusenkyo and its effects and the 
how&#39;s and why&#39;s she was the way she was now. Of course the four women 
that this was news to were looking at the others as if to determine if 
this was a joke. They weren&#39;t sure because every time they caught one of 
their eyes, the person in the know would start giggling about the 
magical girl thing. However, any doubts as to this being a joke were 
laid to rest by the simple expedient of a demonstration.

&quot;So you see,&quot; Ranma joked with the four stunned women, &quot;I&#39;m actually a 
pretty sailor suited aquatransexual soldier for love and justice.&quot; The 
other six women in the room, plus Max, dissolved into laughter again.

&quot;Well?&quot; Ranma asked, once the laughter died down. The four new members 
of the inner circle stared at Ranma for a while. Ranma was starting to 
sweat under the scrutiny when Bertha burst into laughter.

&quot;You know,&quot; the large German woman said, &quot;before I joined the RDF, I was 
a professional Dominatrix. I believe I have seen every twist and kink 
that the human psyche has to offer. This is not even close to being one 
of them. Mom, I accept your choice and respect you for having the 
strength to overcome such a difficult situation. I must say it&#39;s 
certainly...unusual but not something that freaks me out. However, if 
you would like to play at some point, I still pursue my hobby in my off 
time. I think we could have some interesting fun.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s mine,&quot; Lisa growled dangerously, putting her arms around Ranma 
possessively. Bertha laughed.

&quot;You are both invited then,&quot; Bertha grinned.

&quot;Ah, thanks, but, I&#39;ll pass,&quot; Ranma laughed then took on a haunted look. 
&quot;I had enough of that BDSM stuff growing up, only it was real, not 
something done for enjoyment.&quot;

&quot;Understandable,&quot; Bertha said.

&quot;And the rest of you? Midori?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Well, I think it&#39;s weird, but in a kinda cool way,&quot; the young Japanese 
woman said. &quot;I never thought I&#39;d meet a real life magical girl, but you 
certainly fit the description.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know you that well, Ma&#39;am, but I like what I&#39;ve seen of you so 
far,&quot; Angelique said. &quot;It took a lot of guts to come in here and be 
upfront with us, and you obviously have the support of those that have 
served with you for a while. I don&#39;t feel like you are anything other 
than you have shown yourself to be, an outstanding female officer and a 
great CO that will stand up for her pilots no matter what it costs her 
personally. I remember the fight between you and Commander Hayes. You 
had my loyalty locked up right there.&quot;

&quot;I completely agree with Angie, Mom,&quot; Hillary said.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ranma said, giving them a grateful smile. &quot;You don&#39;t know what 
a relief that is.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Bertha Stott was walking down the sidewalk when she saw them. Three men, 
one wearing a dress and seemingly oblivious to the stares they were 
receiving. These three would be perfect for her needs. She had a BDSM 
party coming up and needed a few subs for some of the performances to be 
held at the party.

Bertha strode up to them, looking them over imperiously and wordlessly 
establishing her dominance. The men began to sweat under her scrutiny 
and she knew they would work out fine.

&quot;You three, come with me,&quot; she commanded with authority. &quot;I have a job 
for you.&quot;

Rico, Konda, and Bron, three Zentradi spies, didn&#39;t know quite what to 
make of this. At first they thought their cover had been compromised, 
but then the woman, obviously someone in charge, said she had a job for 
them. They decided that they had no choice but to follow her orders or 
their cover would be blown.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma walked into the White Dragon. Lisa was off doing something that 
she wouldn&#39;t tell Ranma about and had told Ranma not to expect her for 
most of the day. So, after coming out to the girls and talking to Rick, 
she decided to have lunch at the White Dragon and maybe talk to Minmei.

&quot;Ranma!&quot; Minmei exclaimed, catching sight of the redhead. &quot;You bad girl! 
You still have to get with the studio to do the back ups and the song 
you promised them before they can release the album.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure Minmei,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Do you think I could talk to you for a 
bit?&quot;

&quot;Um...sure,&quot; Minmei responded. She led them over and sat them down in a 
booth. &quot;What did you want to talk about?&quot;

&quot;Well, I wanted to tell you a story,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;It&#39;s the story of a 
young man and a young woman and a war. You see, this young man was 
against wars and the people who fought them. Unfortunately one day war 
came to his life. Now there was this girl the young man was interested 
in and cared about a lot. The war threatened her though it really didn&#39;t 
touch her world beyond a looming specter of impending tragedy. This 
young man found that he couldn&#39;t stand by and do nothing when the girl 
that he cared so much for needed to be protected. So against everything 
his father had taught him, he became a soldier to make sure the war 
never touched the girl.

&quot;As the war raged on, just outside of the girl&#39;s world, the young man 
saw many horrible things and lost friends and comrades to the war. He 
was forced to grow up very fast as his youthful idealism was torn from 
him. Still, as long as the girl was safe, he could bear the burden 
placed upon him. The girl went about her life, looking forward to her 
future and was largely able to ignore the war. She kept busy and between 
both their responsibilities, they weren&#39;t able to see much of each 
other.

&quot;And then one day the young man didn&#39;t come home from the war. The war 
had claimed him and took him from the girl. When she was told what had 
happened, the girl realized that she had never told the young man how 
she felt about him. She had always thought she was too young to have to 
worry about such things and had assumed that there would be plenty of 
time to tell him she cared when she was older. But now that could never 
be. You see, she didn&#39;t have plenty of time and now she would never have 
the chance to be with him.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s so sad,&quot; Minmei said wiping a tear from her eye.

&quot;Yeah, it is,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Minmei, don&#39;t let this be your story.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, Ranma?&quot; Minmei asked.

&quot;I mean, Rick,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Do you care for him?&quot;

&quot;Well, of course I do,&quot; Minmei said. &quot;He&#39;s a really good friend.&quot;

&quot;Is that all, Minmei? Just a friend, or maybe more than a friend?&quot; Ranma 
asked.

&quot;Well,&quot; Minmei said blushing. &quot;Maybe someday when...I&#39;m...older...&quot; she 
trailed off as the import of Ranma&#39;s story snapped into perspective. 
&quot;You&#39;re saying I should tell him?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ranma nodded. &quot;I&#39;m not saying you have to do anything you aren&#39;t 
ready for, but right now he&#39;s feeling pretty lonely and confused. He 
doesn&#39;t know how you feel about him and feels like he&#39;s losing you 
because you get to see so little of each other with your singing taking 
off and everything. He doesn&#39;t feel like there&#39;s a place in your world 
for him anymore.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s not true,&quot; Minmei denied. &quot;I do want him in my world.&quot;

&quot;Then maybe you can talk to him,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;About the two of you. I 
know he wants that. He told me he could handle not seeing you much if he 
just knew where he stood. Maybe you should tell him how you feel.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, Ranma,&quot; Minmei said with determination. &quot;I just never 
thought...&quot;

&quot;And you shouldn&#39;t have had to,&quot; Ranma reassured her. &quot;That&#39;s why war is 
so terrible. It forces us to grow up too fast.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Ranma,&quot; Minmei said. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go call Rick right now.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

March 2010...

As the SDF-1 neared Earth, Ranma and Lisa were quietly married in a 
small, private, but completely bizarre double ceremony performed by the 
captain. Guests included only Roy, Claudia and the members of Wild Rose 
Squadron. Roy stood as Ranma&#39;s best man for that part of the ceremony, 
while Claudia was Lisa&#39;s maid of honor. For the second part, Vicki stood 
as Ranma&#39;s maid of honor while Claudia still stood for Lisa.

After the ceremony, there was a small reception that included a few more 
guests. It was kept short and non-alcoholic due to the threat of attack 
as they got closer to Earth. The Brides, now known as Lisa and Ranma 
Saotome-Hayes, were eventually sent off and informed they would be court 
marshaled should either of them turn up for duty before the SDF-1 
touched down on Earth again.

Gloval&#39;s plan, based on Lisa&#39;s assessment that the Zentradi didn&#39;t want 
to destroy the SDF-1, was working perfectly. They had been surrounded 
and shadowed the whole way back to Earth but the aliens did not attack. 
This held until they reached Earth orbit. Then something bizarre 
happened.

Part of the alien force attacked, forcing Gloval to scramble the 
fighters, transform the ship and fight off the first wave. The second 
wave was coming in, but then the other part of the Zentradi fleet moved 
to intercede on the SDF-1&#39;s behalf. It was a perplexing action for the 
Earth forces but they were thankful for the respite as the massive ship 
began to plow atmosphere.

Ranma and Lisa were of course going nuts through out the battle, unused 
to not being in the thick of it but they managed to distract 
themselves...barely.

Once the SDF-1 touched down in the Pacific Ocean, the newly weds did 
something they hadn&#39;t done in a long time. They carried a pair of deck 
chairs out onto the deck of the SDF-1 and proceeded to sunbathe. They 
were shortly joined by the other Rose&#39;s, much to the delight of the crew 
who were also out to get the first breath of fresh air they&#39;d had in a 
long time.

Of course, sunbathing entailed quite a lot of their slow sensual 
sunscreen application, much to Akane&#39;s discomfort as she looked on 
enviously.

&quot;You know, Ranma,&quot; Lisa said lazily as Ranma rubbed sunscreen on her. 
&quot;The only thing that would make this better is a frozen Rumrunner.&quot;

&quot;Nu uh,&quot; Ranma said with a wicked grin. &quot;No booze for you, Momma.&quot;

Lisa looked at her curiously for a moment and then nearly fell out of 
her deck chair as the implications sunk in.

&quot;No way!&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You couldn&#39;t possible know that.&quot; Ranma grinned 
and tenderly rubbed Lisa&#39;s flat tummy.

&quot;Ki doesn&#39;t lie, Love,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;I can feel it in your ki right 
here.&quot; Ranma placed her hand over Lisa&#39;s womb. &quot;It&#39;s mostly just a 
pooling of your ki, but I can very faintly feel another ki signature 
developing.&quot;

Lisa looked down in awe and wonder at where Ranma&#39;s hand rested. 
Suddenly she burst into tears of joy and grabbed Ranma in a hug.

&quot;I&#39;m so happy, Ranma,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I love you so much...&quot; Lisa trailed 
off, suddenly tense. &quot;Oh dear...&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Beautiful?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;What are we going to tell my father?&quot; Lisa said, suddenly afraid of 
what her father might say.

&quot;I guess it&#39;d be too much to ask that he wouldn&#39;t have an issue with 
this, huh?&quot; Ranma sighed. Lisa looked up at Ranma, narrowing her eyes.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if he has an issue with it,&quot; Lisa said fiercely. &quot;I&#39;m 
your wife and I&#39;m proud to be so. If he can&#39;t handle that then it&#39;s his 
problem.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure, Honey?&quot; Ranma said, concerned.

&quot;I&#39;ve never been more sure of anything more than I am of the fact that I 
love you and I am ridiculously proud of you,&quot; Lisa smiled reassuringly. 
&quot;You know, Daddy didn&#39;t approve of Karl. He wanted me to find someone 
with &#39;more fighting spirit&#39;. Well, I did, so if he doesn&#39;t like the rest 
of the package he can&#39;t go pound sand. I can&#39;t wait to introduce you.&quot; 
Ranma laughed nervously.

&quot;Yeah, I can&#39;t wait,&quot; Ranma said deadpanned.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Hey Commander?&quot; Rick said, knocking on Ranma&#39;s office door.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Ranma asked, motioning for him to come in.

&quot;I wanted to say thanks for talking to Minmei for me,&quot; Rick said.

&quot;Is everything all better now?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Yeah, we finally cleared the air,&quot; Rick said. &quot;She&#39;s officially my 
girlfriend now and we worked things out so we could see more of each 
other. We also communicate a lot better now.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s great,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;I&#39;m happy for you both.&quot;

&quot;I have another favor to ask, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Rick said scratching the back of 
his head uncertainly.

&quot;Go on,&quot; Ranma prompted.

&quot;Well, you see, Minmei is being allowed to leave the ship to go see her 
family in Yokohama,&quot; Rick explained. &quot;She&#39;s asked me to go with her.&quot;

&quot;Oooo, things must be getting serious if you are going to meet the 
folks,&quot; Ranma teased. Rick laughed nervously.

&quot;Uh...yeah, well, I was wondering if 
Icouldborrowyourfanjettoflyherthere?&quot; Rick finished in a rush. Ranma 
blinked a couple of times.

&quot;You want to borrow my fan jet to take Minmei to see her parents?&quot; Ranma 
asked. Rick nodded in confirmation. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know...&quot; Ranma said 
thoughtfully. &quot;Do you promise not to fly it into the middle of any 
airshows you might happen to be near?&quot;

&quot;I...um...learned my lesson the last time, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Rick sweatdropped. 
Ranma chuckled.

&quot;Good to hear it,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Sure, you can borrow it. But if it comes 
back with so much as a scratch, you&#39;ll be eating through a straw. Got 
it?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am. Thank you, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Rick said excitedly. &quot;I&#39;ll take good 
care of her for you, Ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Take good care of both of them,&quot; Ranma chuckled. &quot;Have a good time.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Rick said, rushing out of the office to give Minmei 
the good news.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Are you ready, Mrs. Ranma Saotome-Hayes?&quot; Lisa smiled at the woman 
beside her as they approached the shuttle hand in hand.

&quot;As ready as I&#39;ll ever be, Mrs. Lisa Saotome-Hayes,&quot; Ranma said with a 
look of determination.

&quot;Just remember, if Daddy makes me choose, you and the baby are going to 
win hands down,&quot; Lisa said reassuringly. &quot;I love you and I&#39;ll never let 
you go.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Lisa,&quot; Ranma gave her a weak smile. &quot;I love you too.&quot;

&quot;Ladies, are we ready?&quot; Gloval asked, giving them a fatherly smile as 
they boarded the shuttle.

&quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; Lisa smiled. &quot;Let&#39;s go face the music.&quot;

As soon as they were in the air and at cruising altitude, Ranma made her 
way to the small galley and began to heat up some water. While it was 
heating she entered the lavatory and changed into the male version of 
her uniform. Once that was done she adjusted her ribbons and medals, 
took her hair out of its French braid, putting it in a low ponytail, and 
exited the compartment. The water was boiling so she steeled herself and 
dumped the minimum amount to cause the change over her head. Now male 
and properly attired, he spent the rest of the flight being coached by 
Lisa and Captain Gloval on monitoring his mannerisms.

Their plan was to show Lisa&#39;s father a son-in-law he would be proud of 
and once Donald Hayes expressed his approval, they would drop the bomb 
on him. To make it work, Ranma had to be on his best male behavior. He 
would have to monitor his mannerisms ultra closely. It was, perhaps, not 
the nicest way of doing it, but Lisa was still harboring some resentment 
about her father disapproving of Karl.

Ranma hoped this would be the last time he had to explain about the 
curse. He was getting seriously tired of repeating the tale.
