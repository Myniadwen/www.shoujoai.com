<h1>Marital Arts (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hayashi.html">Jon K. Hayashi</a><br> </h2>
<pre>What has gone before:
Nothing.  This is the recounting of the three visits between the 
Saotomes and Tendos before Ranma and Akane learn about the 
engagements.

------------------------------------------------

Episode 0:  Three Visits
Part I - First Visit

------------------------------------------------

Nodoka:  &quot;You&#39;re planning to what?&quot;
Genma:  &quot;Dearest, now that Soun and I have finally gotten rid of 
        Happosai, I have to train our children to become martial 
        artists.  It has to be done on the road, away from the 
        softening influence of a mother.  I promise that I will raise 
        them to be the best of people.  After all, Ranma will hardly 
        be able to take over Soun&#39;s dojo after he marries Akane if he 
        wasn&#39;t, would he?&quot;

Nodoka pushed Genma onto the chair.  Genma had hoped that if he 
could talk fast enough he would be able to stun Nodoka into giving 
him an opportunity to go.  It wasn&#39;t working.

Nodoka:  &quot;Now, you&#39;re going to tell me everything.  Especially about 
        Ranma and Akane.&quot;

Ranma and Ranko continued to play outside.  Every so often they 
could be seen jumping onto the bamboo fence or the neighborhood 
trees, already displaying the promise of ability that Genma and 
Nodoka could sense in them.

**************

Genma watched as Nodoka finished her phone call to the Tendo 
home.  He could tell Nodoka hadn&#39;t been pleased at either 
announcement he had made.  Every time he had made a move to get 
out of his seat Nodoka had been prepared with her katana.

Nodoka hung up the phone and walked to him, opening her kimono 
and letting it drop to the floor.  She sat on his lap and put her arms 
around his neck.  Genma breathed a sigh of relief because he wasn&#39;t 
going to be killed.  Nodoka ran her hands through his hair as she 
brought his head to hers; his hands traveled down her back to rest on 
her ass.  They had been married seven years and still hadn&#39;t reached 
the point of being even remotely tired of each other.  Of course, the 
last couple of years had been spent away from each other because of 
Happosai.  Nodoka&#39;s hands moved down to release the drawstring on 
his pants.

Ranma and Ranko entered the kitchen for lunch.  Used to the goings-
on between their parents, they opened the refrigerator, got lunch, and 
went back to playing outside.

**************

By the next morning, Genma and Nodoka had worked out a 
compromise.  Genma would be allowed to take training trips with 
their children as long as Nodoka would be given the same 
opportunity.  In between those times they would live like a normal 
martial arts family.  Genma found that he couldn&#39;t live the celibate 
life (and he knew that Nodoka would somehow know if he ever 
strayed).  He also knew that breaking his promise to return would not 
be forgiven.

Nodoka led her family to the Tendo Dojo.  Ranko carried some 
flowers.  Ranma carried a sake bottle and some fish wrapped in pink 
paper.  He felt a little sorry for himself as carrying the gifts didn&#39;t 
allow him to jump around the streets like his sister.

Nodoka knocked on the front door.

Nodoka:  &quot;Hello?  We&#39;re here.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Hold on!  We&#39;ll be right there.&quot;

Kimiko Tendo opened the door and when she saw Nodoka, hugged 
her.  They held the hug a little too long, but not perceptible to the 
others, in remembrance of their shared past.  Behind Kimiko, her 
children stood watching the exchange as Soun came forward to greet 
Genma.

Kimiko:  &quot;Are these your twins?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Yes.  This is Ranma, and this is Ranko.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Let me introduce my children.  This is Kasumi,&quot; 
        [indicating the tallest one]  &quot;Nabiki, and Akane.  Akane is 
        five years old, just like Ranma and Ranko.  Children, these 
        are the Saotomes, old friends of your father and I.  Where 
        are your manners, children?  Kasumi, you help Uncle 
        Genma with his packages.  Nabiki, take the flowers from 
        Ranko, and Akane, help Ranma.  Please enter.&quot;

**************

Ranko and Ranma were given a tour of the dojo by the three girls.  
They decided to play &quot;follow the leader&quot;.

Ranko:  &quot;Come on, its easy.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Hey!  I can&#39;t jump that high!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Sure you can.  We&#39;ll show you.&quot;

Ranma and Ranko jumped down from the tree next to the three girls, 
then showed them how to jump.

**************

Nodoka and Kimiko glared across their cups of tea at their husbands.  
They gulped.

Nodoka:  &quot;We&#39;re not saying that your idea to marry our children is a 
        particularly bad one.  But we don&#39;t believe you should force 
        them into marriage if they don&#39;t want it.  So, Kimiko and I 
        have agreed to let the engagement stand.  For now.  When 
        Ranma and Akane are sixteen, we&#39;ll let them decide for 
        themselves whether or not to continue with the 
        engagement.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;And Soun... don&#39;t do this with Nabiki or Kasumi.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Or Ranko.&quot;

The four parents watched their children walk along the top of the 
dojo wall.

Nodoka:  &quot;Be careful, dears.&quot;
Ranma and Ranko:  &quot;Yes, mom...&quot;

***************

Nodoka and Kimiko went to talk in the kitchen as Soun and Genma 
started to play a game of shogi and celebrate how well Ranma and 
Akane seemed to be getting along.  Kimiko poured more tea for 
Nodoka.

Kimiko:  &quot;How are Ranma and Ranko doing?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;They&#39;re coming along fine.  Everything seems to be one 
        big game for them.  They both show a lot of promise.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;For Genma&#39;s school, or yours?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Both.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Yes, well, all three of my girls show promise as well, 
        though I think only Akane shows any real interest in martial 
        arts.  Soun doesn&#39;t really want to start training her.  He 
        thinks he&#39;ll accidentally hurt his &#39;little baby&#39;.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Kimiko, are you... ready to start?&quot;
Kimiko:  [nodding]  &quot;A little scared that I might miss something.  
        Nodoka, do you ever regret not revealing our secret to our 
        husbands?&quot;

Nodoka placed her hand on Kimiko&#39;s.  Both remembered a time 
when their hands would be joined in lovemaking, before they chose 
to separate and love only their husbands.

Nodoka:  &quot;Sometimes.  I think that the four of us would have 
        survived the shock.  I think it was the right choice; we 
        couldn&#39;t have hid our relationship from the neighbors for 
        very long.  Maybe someday, when the children are grown 
        up...&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Yes, maybe someday...&quot;

**************

The children slept in the dojo that night, since Soun hadn&#39;t yet 
advertised that the dojo would be taking students.  Ranma and Ranko 
were particularly excited; Genma was taking them on their first 
training trip the next day.  In the guest room and the master 
bedroom, their parents made love after checking on them.  For 
Nodoka and Genma it was almost frenzied, as neither knew how long 
it would be until they were together again.

*****************************

Part II:  Second Visit

Nodoka watched from the picnic area as Nabiki ran with the string.  
The kite leaped high into the air as Ranma gave Akane a lizard he 
caught while playing tag in the bushes.  The children had been happy 
to see each other again, even after three years.  Nodoka thought to 
herself that part of it was that her children never did get to form any 
true friendships on the road; they were always leaving after a month 
or two.  And the one that they did form, two years ago... she had been 
very firm with Genma not to do that again.

Kimiko placed the containers of food on the mat and called everyone 
to eat.  The children all rushed in to quickly eat their food so that 
they could go back to playing their games.  Nodoka and Kimiko 
smiled at them as they ran off into the park.  They rose and started to 
follow their children, leaving Soun and Genma to play shogi.

**************

The five children ran to the arch bridge to look down at the fish in 
the pond.  Kasumi, the eldest at 11, took out some old bread from a 
package that she carried and handed it out to everyone.  Ranma and 
Ranko looked at it and started to put it in their mouths, but stopped 
when the others broke the bread into small pieces to throw into the 
water.

As each piece hit the water the fish in the pond fought for it; soon 
Ranma and Ranko were also throwing the bread into the water while 
their mothers caught up to them.

Nodoka:  &quot;How has your training been going?&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;It&#39;s hard, sometimes, with Soun around.  It&#39;s almost done.  
        I wish it didn&#39;t have to be a secret from our children, as 
        well.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;You know that it would affect the way they interact with 
        other children.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;I know... that doesn&#39;t make it any better, though.&quot;

Nodoka and Kimiko smiled as their children waved at them from the 
bridge.

Kimiko:  &quot;How about you?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Genma and I take turns with training trips.  So he&#39;s never 
        had a chance to find out.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;What about making love?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;There are times when he&#39;s gone that I really wish he was 
        there.  I wish he wouldn&#39;t leave, but I can&#39;t stop him.  He 
        wants to train Ranma and Ranko in martial arts.  Its his 
        dream.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;I know...  Soun has started to train Akane.  Kasumi and 
        Nabiki don&#39;t really show any inclination towards martial 
        arts.  I think Kasumi is interested in science and Nabiki in 
        math.  Nabiki is very good with numbers.&quot;

Nodoka and Kimiko started to walk up the bridge.  Ahead of them, 
their children had already run to a different section of the park.

Kimiko:  &quot;I think Akane really likes Ranma.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I&#39;m glad.  I hope that they do fall in love.  It would be nice 
        if it worked out.&quot;
Kimiko:  [after some silence]  &quot;What happened to Genma&#39;s hair?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;When did Soun decide to grow a mustache?&quot;

**************

Kasumi watched as Kimiko chopped up vegetables for dinner.

Kasumi:  &quot;Mother, let me try.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Not quite yet, Kasumi.  You&#39;re still too young to use the 
        knives.  Why don&#39;t you see if Auntie needs help with the 
        miso soup.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Do you need help, Auntie?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Of course you can help, Kasumi.  Why don&#39;t you stir the 
        miso into the water while I get the other ingredients ready.&quot;
 
Kasumi stepped on a small stool to give her the height needed to 
safely stir the miso, taking the small sieve and spoon from Nodoka.  
Nodoka showed Kasumi how to stir the miso paste that was in the 
sieve into the water slowly, by spooning the hot water into the sieve 
and stirring, and every so often dipping the sieve into the water.  
Kasumi smiled to herself as she performed her task.  Nodoka turned 
to the cutting board and sliced the tofu, the chinese cabbage, and the 
green onions.  She reflected that Kasumi would grow to be quite 
beautiful, as would Nabiki and Akane.

Kasumi:  &quot;Auntie, I&#39;m done.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;OK, Kasumi.  Help me put these in.&quot;

Nodoka brought the cutting board to the pot.  Kasumi started to push 
the cubes of tofu, and the chinese cabbage strips into the broth.

**************

Ranma started snoring.  Akane, Ranko, and Nabiki, who were 
playing cards, looked sourly at him.  That is, until they took out some 
of Akane&#39;s felt pens from school.

***************

Ranma and Ranko started fighting each other after jumping out of 
Akane&#39;s bedroom window.  Nodoka immediately heard the 
commotion and guessed what was going on, calling her children to 
her.  Inside the dojo, Soun went on with teaching his beginner&#39;s class.

When Nodoka first saw what had happened to Ranma she started to 
laugh.  Ranma started to pout.  Kimiko and Kasumi also came out of 
the kitchen and started to giggle.  Nodoka took her two children to 
the bathroom and undressed; Ranma definitely needed to be cleaned 
and it seemed a good a time as any to take a bath.

Nodoka scrubbed Ranma&#39;s face and arms clean of ink; luckily, it all 
washed off easily.  A few minutes later Akane and Nabiki joined 
them.  Nodoka poured water on Ranma to wash away the soap.  
Akane hugged Ranma.

Akane:  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ranma.  OK?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;OK.&quot;
Nabiki:  [also hugging Ranma]  &quot;Me too.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;OK.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Me too.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;No.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Ranma!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;She&#39;s not sorry.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Ranma&#39;s just mad he can&#39;t beat me.&quot;

The beginner&#39;s class was extremely surprised when two naked 
children fought their way into the dojo.  At least until the twins used 
them as posts to bounce off of and knocked them unconcious.  
Nodoka came running after her two children with a towel wrapped 
around her mid-section, surprising Soun, then took her two children 
by the ear back to the furo, where Akane and Nabiki were already 
soaking in the hot water. 

*****************************

Part III:  Third Visit

Kasumi greeted the Saotomes at the front door.  Soun ran around the 
house crying.

Nodoka:  &quot;How is your mother, Kasumi?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Weak, but she wanted to talk with you right away.&quot;

Nodoka nodded and led her two children upstairs.  She sent them to 
check on Akane and Nabiki, then entered the bedroom of her former 
lover.

**************

[END OF POST MARKED PART 1]
[BEGINNING OF POST MARKED PART 2]


Marital Arts 0

The twins knocked meekly on the bedroom doors of their friends.  
Nabiki was in Akane&#39;s room, and when the twins entered they were 
almost knocked to the ground by the sisters, who started to cry in 
their arms. 

**************

Nodoka smiled at Kimiko.

Nodoka:  &quot;Are you experiencing any pain, Kimiko?&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Some, but I can ignore it by separating myself from my 
        body.  I wanted to be sure I was alert when you showed up.  
        We have to talk...&quot;

Kasumi knocked and entered.

Kasumi:  &quot;Mother, do you or Auntie need anything?&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;No, thank you, Kasumi.  I&#39;d like to talk to Auntie Nodoka 
        privately, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Of course not, Mother.&quot;

Kasumi left the room, closing the door behind her.

Nodoka:  &quot;She&#39;s turning into quite a beauty, isn&#39;t she?&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Yes, she is.  She&#39;s almost taken over all of my household 
        duties as well.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Is it that bad?&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;I think so.  I don&#39;t think I have much time left.  I&#39;ve just 
        been waiting for you to arrive so we could talk about my 
        children.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;My two are visiting Nabiki and Akane right now.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Do you think Ranma will love her?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  He likes her a lot.  But he&#39;s still too young 
        for that.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Sometimes they know.  I think Akane likes him.  She has 
        friends, but... none that she can open up so easily as with 
        Ranma or Ranko.  If they kept in regular contact over the 
        next few years I think they would fall in love without any 
        prodding from us.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Genma wants to start taking my two on longer training 
        trips...&quot;

Kimiko stretched out her hand and Nodoka took it into her own.

Kimiko:  &quot;I understand.  At least after they&#39;re sixteen...&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I&#39;ll train them as we would have done.  I promise.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Thank you, Noka-chan.  I have another favor to ask as 
        well.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;What is it, Kimi-chan?&quot;

Both women smiled at their nicknames, given each other when they 
first became lovers.  Kimiko became serious. 
 
Kimiko:  &quot;If Soun should have problems accepting my death, will 
        you... help him?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;You mean...&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;The incense is in the back of the cabinet under the family 
        alter.  I&#39;ve tried to help him accept it, but he just can&#39;t seem 
        to let some things go.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Some things!  You&#39;re not &#39;some thing&#39;.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;I know.  Please, Noka-chan?  For me?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I don&#39;t want to, Kimi-chan.  I&#39;ve always been faithful to 
        Genma, even with you.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;But you will?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I... I will.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Thank you, Noka-chan.  I&#39;ll write a letter in case Kasumi 
        discovers the two of you together.  She&#39;s the only one that 
        might try to find out what was going on.&quot;

Nodoka found herself crying.

Kimiko:  &quot;I&#39;m only sorry that we couldn&#39;t have seen the four of us 
        together.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I know.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Now let me tell you how Soun and I make love so that he&#39;ll 
        believe it&#39;s me.&quot;

**************

Kimiko:  &quot;Noka-chan.  You said you haven&#39;t betrayed Genma yet.  I 
        haven&#39;t done so with Soun.  But I want to spend as much of 
        the time I have left with him... and I want to make love to 
        you.  If you want...&quot;

Nodoka stood and unwrapped the kimono from her body.  She hadn&#39;t 
been sure if she would when she first arrived, even if Kimiko had 
asked her like she did.  But being next to her made it different and 
simple.  They still loved each other.  She stepped out of her kimono 
and checked to make sure the door was locked; in the meantime 
Kimiko moved out from under the bedsheets and removed her 
nightgown.

Kimiko found that the pain returned somewhat as she removed 
herself from her meditative state.  But that was soon forgotten as she 
reunited with her former lover.

**************

Nodoka dressed herself; it had been some time since she first entered 
the room, but nothing that couldn&#39;t be explained by the friendship 
they shared and the time since they last saw each other.  Kimiko 
slipped back underneath the covers, a little slowly as the pain became 
more noticeable to her.

Kimiko:  &quot;Noka-chan, would you send Soun up here?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;You&#39;re insatiable.&quot;
Kimiko:  &quot;Its just love.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I know how that is.&quot;

Nodoka smiled and kissed Kimiko with a lover&#39;s kiss, both knowing 
it would be their last.  Nodoka left the bedroom to look for her 
children.  She found them looking extremely uncomfortable as Akane 
and Nabiki had fallen asleep on them.  She gently moved the sisters 
so that they continued sleeping; Ranko and Ranma moved slowly out 
of the way.

Nodoka led them downstairs to the guest room, where she let 
instructed them to take a short nap after unpacking their things.  She 
then went to send Soun to Kimiko.  Nodoka still hoped that she 
wouldn&#39;t have to make love to him, but he was already starting to 
display the hysterics that Kimiko talked about.

**************

Nodoka entered the kitchen and checked on the amount of &quot;special 
tea&quot; in the cupboard.

Nodoka:  &quot;Kasumi, may I talk to you for a moment?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Of course, Auntie.  I was just starting to prepare dinner.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;In a way, that&#39;s part of what I want to talk about.  Come, 
        sit down.&quot;  [both sit at the kitchen table]  &quot;Your parents 
        probably won&#39;t be at dinner tonight.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Oh, why?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;They&#39;re making love.&quot;

Kasumi blushed.  She and her mother had talked about it, and she 
had learned about it in school, yet to bring it up so openly...

Kasumi:  &quot;Auntie!&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Its nothing to be ashamed of, Kasumi.  Your parents love 
        each other.  This is part of how they express it.  Your mother 
        has talked to you about it, hasn&#39;t she?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Well... yes...&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;And how do you feel about it?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;I... I haven&#39;t done it yet.  I want to wait until I&#39;m married.&quot;
Nodoka:  [smiling]  &quot;That&#39;s not what I asked, Kasumi.  I wanted to 
        know if you were comfortable talking about it, but I suppose 
        you aren&#39;t.  You&#39;re still young.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Yes, Auntie.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Kasumi, your mother told me she hasn&#39;t talked to either 
        Nabiki or Akane yet about sex, or having a period, or any of 
        that.  Do you feel that you can talk to them or would you like 
        me to talk to them when the time comes?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;I can do it, Auntie.  You make it sound like Mother&#39;s 
        going to die soon.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;That&#39;s what she says.  And I&#39;ve known your mother far too 
        long to not trust her instincts.&quot;

Kasumi started to choke as tears started to fall.

Kasumi:  &quot;I thought that she&#39;d get better.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I know.&quot;

Nodoka pulled Kasumi around the table to sit on her lap, letting 
Kasumi cry as she held her in her arms.

**************

Nodoka checked on the children, who had all gathered in one of the 
guest rooms and spread their futons.

Ranma:  &quot;When is Pops going to get here?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I left him note on the kitchen table, Ranma.  But he&#39;s still 
        checking out some training sites.  He&#39;s not going to be back 
        for another week.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Oh.&quot;

**************

Nodoka found herself taking care of most of the funeral 
arrangements.  Soun was racked by grief.  Nodoka wished that 
Genma was there to help her; but it would be another three or four 
days before he even read the note.  Still, she owed her friend anything 
she could do.

**************

After the funeral Soun retired to his room.

Kasumi:  &quot;Father?  Please come out.  You haven&#39;t come out for a 
        whole day.  Dinner is ready.&quot;

Kasumi, not hearing a reply, went to look for Nodoka.  Nodoka 
finished talking on the phone.

Kasumi:  &quot;Auntie.  Father won&#39;t come out.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I know, Kasumi.  That was Uncle Genma on the phone.  
        He&#39;ll be here tomorrow.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Will Uncle be able to help?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I hope so.  Do you want me to try to talk to him?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Please, Auntie?&quot;

Nodoka went to Soun&#39;s bedroom and knocked on the door.  Kasumi 
followed her.

Nodoka:  &quot;Soun?&quot;  [silence]  &quot;Soun, your children need you.&quot;

Nodoka left the door behind her, knowing that if she would follow 
Kimiko&#39;s request, it would have to be that night.

Nodoka:  &quot;Kasumi, I&#39;ll try to talk with him later tonight.  I&#39;d like to 
        talk to him in private because I may have to use some words 
        that you shouldn&#39;t be hearing.&quot;
Kasumi:  [blushing]  &quot;Do you think it will work?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I hope so.&quot;

**************

Nodoka got out the incense from where Kimiko had said it was.  
Soun&#39;s depression was as bad as Kimiko had feared it would be; 
Nodoka also took out the note Kimiko had written for her.  She 
checked on their children sleeping in the guest room and went 
upstairs.

She opened the door to the bedroom; it was dark, but lit by a small 
votive candle on the dresser.  Next to the candle was a picture of 
Kimiko and her ihai.  Soun lay sleeping on the bed.

Nodoka prayed briefly, remembering her friend who had asked her to 
perform the task ahead then sprinkled the incense onto the candle.  
The flame released the hallucinogenic fumes as it consumed the 
incense.  Nodoka gave the smoke time to permeate the room.

Nodoka:  &quot;Soun?  Soun, wake up.  Its me, Kimiko...&quot;

**************

Kasumi opened her eyes as she heard Nodoka shut the door behind 
her.  She moved quietly as to not awaken the others.  She knew that 
she shouldn&#39;t, but she wanted to be there when her father became 
himself again.  Kasumi saw an envelope with her name on it waiting 
for her.

She looked at it in dread.  Even her inexperienced ear could make out 
the sound of lovemaking occurring beyond the door.  That meant it 
could only be Auntie Nodoka and Father.  She opened the letter.  It 
was in her mother&#39;s handwriting.

Dearest Kasumi,

If you are reading this it is because you have discovered your father 
making love to Auntie Nodoka.  Do not blame her for this.  I asked 
her to do it to help your father.  We can not ask the Saotomes to help 
us forever.  One day, soon, I promise that Auntie will explain why I 
asked her to do this.

Mother

**************

Nodoka carefully removed herself from Soun&#39;s embrace.  She opened 
the door to find Kasumi crying behind it.  Nodoka sighed as she 
dressed in the bathrobe she had worn earlier in the evening.  She 
brought Kasumi to her feet and closed the door behind her.  Nodoka 
put her arm around Kasumi&#39;s shoulder in a motherly way and they 
walked to her room.

Nodoka sat down on the bed as Kasumi lay her head on her lap.  
Nodoka slowly ran her hand over Kasumi&#39;s hair.

Nodoka:  &quot;How much did you hear?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;I heard the two of you...&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Do you hate me now?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  Mother says she asked you to do it.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;She did.&quot;

Kasumi started to cry again as Nodoka felt the tears fall onto her lap 
to run down her legs, the bathrobe opening and exposing her body to 
the night air.  Nodoka continued to comfort her, ignoring the chill. 
Kasumi was now the Tendo who needed her the most.

**************

Soun woke up, finding that his dream had seemed so real that his 
body had reacted to it as if Kimiko had been there making love to 
him.  Kimiko had come to him to tell him to move on with his life.  
As he left the room he caught sight of the o-ihai on the dresser.  He 
prayed to it, then brought it down to the family alter.

Genma arrived and expressed his condolences.  The Saotomes stayed 
two more days, then left the Tendos to resume their own lives.

[Author&#39;s note #1:  Since no one seems to know Mrs. Tendo&#39;s first 
name, I made up &quot;Kimiko&quot;.  There is no hidden meaning in it.]

[Author&#39;s note #2:  The &quot;furo&quot;, or bath, is the same one that is 
depicted in the manga.  The hot water is usually filled once a day, 
and users wash outside of the tub.  When clean, the user soaks in the 
hot water.  Since the user is clean of both dirt and soap, the water 
does not need to be replaced.]

[Author&#39;s note #3:  The &quot;ihai&quot; or &quot;o-ihai&quot; is the buddhist memorial 
&quot;tablet&quot; that is presented to the family of the deceased.  It will have the 
name of the deceased written on its front side, and is used for the 
buddhist memorial services.  Typically made out of wood, the easiest 
way to describe it might be a miniature (japanese style) gravestone on 
a small stand.]
