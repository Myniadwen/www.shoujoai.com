<h1>Hentai Adept, Part 4</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nall.html">Nall</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	The ancient Chinese woman sat down at a table in the cat cafe and 
watched her granddaughter.  &lt;It&#39;s amazing&gt; she thought, &lt;that child can
just go on like nothing happened.&gt;
	Indeed, Shampoo seemed totally unaffected by the previous night&#39;s 
encounter with Mousse.  Cologne looked to her right, where the Chinese boy 
did his normal menial tasks.  &lt;And he&#39;s not acting at all different...I 
would have thought that he would be all over spreading the news that him and 
Shampoo would be...&gt;
&quot;Hmmmm...&quot; She mumbled aloud, disturbed by the notion.  
	Her mind went back to the now dry pot of ramen that had caused 
this whole fiasco.  &lt;This is by far the most potent potion my granddaughter 
has ever created: an aphrodisiac able to make anyone aroused at the 
slightest contact.&gt;
	She pondered again.  Her job was cut out for her now.  Since she had 
moved to Japan, Cologne&#39;s job was to help Shampoo with her quest to gain 
Ranma&#39;s hand.  It was tradition, and she would not have someone of her 
own lineage go against it.  
	Cologne had taken the pot of Ramen away the previous night, but 
rather than throw it away, she had taken the remaining hard noodles and had 
stored them in a plastic bag.  This bag was now the focus of her attention.  
&lt;Perhaps, despite the scandal it has caused, the potion will now serve my 
purposes instead...&gt; she thought.  After a moment, the idea hit her.  
&quot;Shampoo, I&#39;m going out.&quot; she called.  
&quot;Hai, Hibichan!&quot; Shampoo replied.

-=-=-=-=-

	It was a cheerful morning at the Tendo Dojo.  Kasumi rose bright and 
early to begin today&#39;s cooking.  Although no one had school today because of 
some sort of holiday, she felt that she should still make them a good 
breakfast.  She made her morning toilet and went to go about getting 
started.  
	As soon as she had walked down the stairs Kasumi knew something was 
unusual.  She heard quiet music and a repetitive tapping sound coming from 
somewhere.  Not only that, but there was a strange odor in the air.  As she 
approached the kitchen the sound, as well as the odor became slightly 
more distinguishable.  The latter being less relieving than the former.  
&quot;Embracing a dream I will not surrender...&quot; came a familiar voice singing in 
harmony with the song from inside.  
&quot;Oh, Akane must be cooking.&quot; she said, keeping a straight face even as the 
worst case scenario played itself in her head.  She approached the doorway 
to the kitchen and found her guess to be correct.  
&quot;Hello, Akane&quot; she said to the girl singing with the radio.  
	The girl jumped in fright.  
&quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed as she dropped the knife she was chopping with.  
	She looked to the doorway with an expression of surprise.  
&quot;Kasumi-oneechan!  You frightened me!&quot; the younger sister said.  
&quot;Oh my, I&#39;m sorry Akane, I didn&#39;t mean to..&quot; she looked at what the girl had 
been doing.  &quot;Were you cooking breakfast?&quot; 
&quot;Ummm, Hai&quot; the girl replied meekly, picking up the knife.  
&quot;Okay, why don&#39;t we do it together then?&quot; Kasumi asked.  Trying to salvage 
the lives those who would later eat the breakfast.  
&quot;Sure, Onechan!&quot;
	Neither sister noticed as the stealthy old woman as she exited the 
room without a sound.  

-=-=-=-

	Okonomiyaki Ucchans was open for business, and Ukyou was already  
making her characteristic dish for the regular customers.  While she 
prepared the food, she was additonally making a special batter for a private 
banquet to be held at her restaurant.  Apparently, some local sandlot team 
had decided to end their four year career completely undefeated.  
	Ukyou had at first been against it.  Usually she did not allow 
private banquets because, unlike most restaurants, she typically made more 
money from the general public, but the captain of the team had made her an 
offer that would make her more money in an hour and a half than she usually 
made all day.  How could a business woman like Ukyou refuse?
&quot;Boy, this sure is gonna take a lot of batter.&quot; she mumbled over the rather 
large pot of batter she was mixing.  &quot;Hmmmm, I&#39;m going to need nori flakes 
for this...&quot; 
	Cologne, unseen by any human eye, made her move and sprinkled 
something from a small shaker into the batter for the private party...

-=-=-=-

	The old woman chuckled as she walked back to her home, she had now 
planted the seeds that, with care, would grow into a marriage for Shampoo.  
Cologne&#39;s attention moved to the jar of powder in her hand.  
&quot;My, is this stuff potent!&quot; the old woman thought in amazement.  &quot;Even an 
old wench like me can feel the effects.  Just imagine what it&#39;s going to do 
to Shampoo&#39;s competition!&quot;
	Cologne thought about what the seasoning would do to spice up the 
lives of those involved...

	[Flash to Tendo Dojo, later this morning...]

	&quot;Ranma, I made this breakfast just for you!&quot;  Akane told the boy.  
	&quot;Yeah, er...&quot; 
	&quot;Well, aren&#39;t you going to eat it?&quot; she said, getting impatient.
	&quot;Uhhhh....alright...&quot; he conceded.                  
		Ranma lifted a piece of food to his mouth, wincing as he 
	closed his lips around the morsel.  Slowly he begins to chew.  After 
	what seems like an eternity of grimacing, he finally stops moving 
	his jaw.  Akane waits urgently for the results of her labor.  
	&quot;Well?&quot; she asks sweetly.  
	&quot;I...uh...&quot; the boy looks at her, a spaced look on his face.  He 
	stands and steps forward, grabbing Akane by the shoulders.  
	&quot;Ranma, what...are you...?&quot; she says, concerned by his unusual 
	movements.  
		Ranma merely pulls her to the ground and with a single 
	movement, placed himself above her.  
	&quot;Ranma!  Stop it...!&quot; Akane yells at him.  Ranma hears nothing, 
	being completely engrossed by the potions effects.  He pushes up 
	her skirt and pulls her legs apart.  Akane tries to fight him, but 
	he has all the leverage, and she can&#39;t get any power behind her 
	strikes.  He says nothing as he rips the panties from her, and his 
	own pants are removed.  
	&quot;Ranma, Noooooo!&quot; she screams in denial, tears flowing from her 
	eyes, completely betrayed.  

	[Fade to black as Ranma goes down on Akane]

	Cologne chuckled to herself.  
&lt;*THAT* will ruin their relationship, if anything will.&gt; she thought.  &lt;Of 
course, that&#39;s not the only way it could have happened.  There is of couse 
the presense of the family to be trifled with.&gt;
	She merely shrugged, either way, the scandle the powder would cause 
would no doubt lead to the removal of Shampoo&#39;s biggest rival.  She had been 
careful, however, not to add too much to the food as to make the act 
forcfully inevitable, but she didn&#39;t want to hurt the son in law.  Even as 
much as she had dilluted it, too much of the love potion in one body could 
be dangerous.  
	Her mind wandered to where she had been more liberal in her 
sprinkling.  She chuckled as she thought about the other fiance&#39;s fate...

	[Flash to Okonomiyaki Ucchans, also later this morning.]

		Men from the private party eat their ramen noisily at their 
	tables.  Ukyou absent-mindedly wipes the counter clean.  After a 
	few moments she spies movement from between strands of her brown 
	hair.  
		Ukyou looks up at the approaching men.  They all have vacant 
	looks on their faces as the draw near to the girl.  
	&quot;Nani...?&quot; she says, a quiver forming in her voice.  
	As more men approach Ukyou becomes worried and draws her spatula for 
	defense but seems to know there are far too many for her to handle.  
	A moment later she is grabbed from behind and thrown to the floor 
	as her clothes are ripped from her body by many hands.  Ukyou 
	screams at her exposure as the crowd of men begin to remove their 
	clothes.  

	[Fade to black as she is buried beneath the mass of flesh]

	The Chinese woman laughed aloud.  
&quot;Boy, is she going to be out of the running after that fiasco.&quot;
	Not only would Ukyou be humiliated, but the men would all be 
witnesses of a sort.  In a short amount of time, Ucchan&#39;s parlor, as well 
as Ukyou&#39;s own reputation would be ruined.  Ranma could not even consider a 
girl in that state as a bride, no matter how bad he felt for her.  
	Cologne nearly hurt herself laughing.  

-=-=-=-=-

&quot;Ranma!&quot; came Kasumi&#39;s voice.  
	Ranma seemed to shrug in his sleep, but did not stir any more.  
&quot;Ranma!  Get up, Ranma!&quot; came the voice again.  
	The boy moved again, but once more did not rise from his futon.  
&quot;Oh, my.&quot; Kasumi said, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll have to ask Nabiki to do this one.&quot;

-=-=-=-

	Nabiki slowly moved her hand up and down the body of the man in 
front of her.  He was so muscular, his body was as strong as steel, as if  
molded perfectly from plastic.  She felt as he moved his arms down below and 
grabbed her buttocks.  Her body reveled in this sensation, there was no 
better feeling in the world than to feel so close to him.  
	He began to knead her soft skin down there, slightly pulling and 
pushing himself against her as he did.  She leaned into him, feeling 
comfortable in his warmth.  Once there she moved not at all, feeling sort 
of a high feeling as he removed her blouse.  He continued and soon had her 
completely naked, but still she clung to his muscled body, not resisting his 
advances in the least.  
	His body pushed against her and in a moment she was lying 
horizontal on a soft cushion, probably a futon.  Nabiki needed no one to 
tell her what was going to happen next, she had long since figured out 
what went on in these situations and had been waiting to lose her cherry for 
a long time.  
	Nabiki closed her eyes as the man positioned himself above her, she 
felt something touch her between the legs.  The girl was thrilled, it was 
about to happen,  her eyes squeezed shut,  she heard a crashing sound deep 
inside her brain from the anticipation....only...only...
	Only it wasn&#39;t coming from inside her head.
	Nabiki&#39;s eyes snapped open as the wall behind her lover exploded.  
The hole in the wall was bright with light; shielding her eyes she could 
make out several dark forms coming fast from the opening.  The forms were 
a blur of hot motion as they swept past her.  Nabiki felt the wall behind 
her splinter as the forms made a new hole.  
	After a moment she could begin to make out her surroundings.  The 
first thing she focused on was her lover.  He was still holding her close 
protectively, but they both lay on their sides, and his face was turned away 
from her towards the light.  Nabiki looked at the figures running past her 
and her mouth dropped.  
&quot;They&#39;re...they&#39;re...&quot; she tried to whisper.  &quot;...Vikings...&quot;
	After a moment, her head screwed up in confusion.  
&quot;Huh?&quot; she said.  
	But there was no mistaking it, nomadic Vikings, complete with axes 
in hand were running through the room.  The girl just watched for long 
moments as dozens of the fur-covered yelling men ran past them.  Then, one 
Viking stopped in front of her.  It looked like all the others, draped in 
hides, his face seemingly an overgrown patch of bushes with the beard.  He 
looked at her with a look of curiosity.  
&quot;Nabiki?&quot; came the voice.  
	The girl just stared back.  The voice somehow seemed detached from 
the man, and also higher in pitch.  
&quot;Nabiki?&quot; the Viking repeated, his mouth moving with the words, but the 
voice seemed to come from somewhere else, somewhere behind him.  
&quot;Wake up, Nabiki!&quot; came the call the third time.  
	Nabiki&#39;s eyes snapped open.
&quot;Uhh, yeah Onechan!&quot; Nabiki responded, attempting to hide the anxiety 
prevalent in her voice.  
&quot;Gomen Nabiki, I didn&#39;t want to wake you up, but I was wondering if you 
would wake Ranma for me, he isn&#39;t listening very well this morning.&quot; Kasumi 
said from the hall.  
&quot;Oh...uh, sure onechan!&quot; Nabiki managed to respond, still groggy and 
nervous.  
&quot;Arigatou!&quot; came the older girl&#39;s thanks.  
	Nabiki waited until she heard Kasumi&#39;s footfalls all the way down 
the hall until she took stock of what had happened.          
&quot;Well, I must have been sleeping.&quot; she reasoned.  She glanced around.  
&quot;It&#39;s my room,&quot; then after a moment, &quot;Huh.&quot; and bit her lip.  
	Nabiki pulled the blanked from her body and looked in embarrassment 
at what she saw.  Between her knees she held a small pillow, the corner of 
it was pressed into her vulva.  The pillow, as well as the sheets were wet.  
&quot;That was some dream...&quot; she mumbled.  She would have to come up with a way 
to hide this from Kasumi.  Nabiki sighed and got up to go and wake 
everybody&#39;s favorite cross-dresser.  

-=-=-=-=-

	Tatewaki Kuno stirred in his sleep, in his dream he saw both Akane 
and the Pig tailed girl.  They were standing in the middle of a meadow 
filled with fragrant wild flowers as white as falling snow.  
&lt;Ah, they&#39;re both so beautiful!&gt; he thought.  
&quot;Come here, Kuno!&quot; Akane shouted to him.  
&quot;No, don&#39;t pick her, come with me Kuno old boy!&quot; the Pig tailed one called 
to him with her customary fire.  
	Kuno stopped less than five meters from them, suddenly unsure of 
which direction he should take.  
&quot;Kuno, my sweet!  Why aren&#39;t you coming for me?&quot; Akane asked sweetly, but 
her voice making him guilty for not immediately charging to her.  Indeed, he 
was about to, if it wasn&#39;t for the red head&#39;s voice calling to him.  
&quot;Kuno, my darling Kuno, don&#39;t you love me?&quot; 
	His mind was torn in two, he could not reject either one of them, 
for they were both the epitome of perfection in women.  They could neither 
be better than the other.  So alike, yet so different.  &lt;Akane, her 
unassuming beauty captivates me, making me wish to do nothing more than to 
stare into her graceful brown eyes for hours.&gt; he pondered, &lt;yet, the 
dazzling display of the pig tailed girl attracts the eye, shamelessly 
displaying the talent and grace of my other love.&gt;
&quot;What am I to do!?!?&quot; he violently yelled at the sky, lamenting his own 
inability to chose one of them.  He collapsed to the ground and covered his 
head, trying to shut out the calls of the girls, giving him space to think.  
He felt their voices, begging him to come to them, both equally as gorgeous 
in their own way.  
	Luckily for Kuno, he didn&#39;t have to decide at that moment, as a few 
seconds later he awoke in his bedroom.  
&quot;Wha...&quot; he said as he sat up.  The boy surveyed his surroundings, his gaze 
finally resting on the two large, 18 x 24 pictures of both Akane Tendo and 
his Pig tailed goddess which hung on his wall opposite of his bed.  
&quot;Oh, it is lamentable, but I must one day choose between my beloveds.&quot;  A 
deep sigh escaped from the upperclassman&#39;s lips.  
&quot;Perhaps meeting with the two lovely maidens will help me decide...&quot;
	Kuno dressed and set out resolutely to his day.  

-=-=-=-=-

	Ranma rolled in his sleep as Nabiki entered his bedroom.  
&quot;If I do this just right...&quot; she whispered.  
	The girl positioned herself with her back to the door and took the 
bucket in both hands.  Holding it in one hand by the handle and the other on 
the bottom Nabiki called out to her victim.  
&quot;RANMA!  WAKE UP!&quot;
&quot;Huh?&quot; Ranma muttered dumbly a moment before the water hit him.  
&quot;What the hell!?&quot; Ranma-chan exclaimed as she sat upright on her futon, her 
cleavage giving a good jiggle in the process.  {Click}
	Ranma-chan looked up to see Nabiki holding a black camera to her 
face, the button on the trigger.  
&quot;Hey!  Nabiki!  Stop it!&quot; the red head said as she leaped to her feet and 
ran the few feet to the girl with the camera.  {Click} {Click} {Click}
&quot;Nabiki!&quot; a very pissed Ranma-chan yelled at the camera.  {Click}
&quot;Oh, Ranma, These few snapshots will make me a mint.  Bye now!&quot;  Nabiki said 
as she slipped out the door at an amazing speed.  
&quot;Why that...that...Oooohhh!&quot; Ranma-chan fumed in the doorway.  
	After she had completed her rant, the girl turned around to go about 
doing her morning routines.  
	Looking back at the place where she had just been sleeping, a large 
panda went on snoring.  
&quot;Lotsa help you are, pops.&quot; she said, kicking with slight force into the 
panda&#39;s side.  &quot;Get up, already.&quot;

-=-=-=-=-

	&quot;Good,&quot; Nabiki said back in her room.  &lt;That will make an excuse for 
the wetness on my sheets.  Kasumi does all the wash at once anyways.&gt; She 
had pulled off a double victory of sorts, not only had she covered herself, 
but she could sell the pictures to Kuno for at least 5,000 yen a piece.  
25,000 yen wasn&#39;t bad for a few minutes work.  
&quot;Nabiki, breakfast is ready!&quot; came a call from downstairs.  
&quot;Be right down!&quot;

-=-=-=-=-

&quot;What is it?&quot; Ranma asked.  
&quot;It&#39;s breakfast of course.&quot; Akane responded, &quot;What else would it be?&quot; as 
she went to dispense the food she had created to the rest of the company.  
	Ranma looked down at the bowl of...something.  It was green and 
gelatinous in nature with small black spots all over the outside and the 
semi-transparent green middle.  As he poked a chopstick in, he found that 
he could not penetrate it.  So, he pushed harder but it still wouldn&#39;t 
give.  He tried again, this time using both hands on the one chopstick.  The 
stuff Gave slightly but then his chopstick snapped in half; Ranma swore the 
thing had pushed back against him.  
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Ranma?&quot; Akane came up behind him, her voice making it plainly 
obvious that she had witnessed at least some of his actions.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you 
going to eat it?!&quot; 
	The people around the table reacted very differently.  Soun began to 
sniffle;  Genma read his newspaper, trying to avoid listening to the 
upcoming fight;  Nabiki read an old Fushigi Yuugi comic, truly ignoring 
their bickering, and Kasumi responded in her customary way.  
&quot;Oh, my.&quot;
	The argument became more intense, and the rest of the family readied 
themselves for what was sure to come.  They also began to look for a way to 
inconspicuously rid themselves of this...stuff in front of them.  Then, as 
expected, the fated moment came.  
&quot;Kawaiikune!&quot; Ranma shouted at her.  
	Everyone waited for the blow to come, but they were interrupted 
instead by another familiar sound.  
&quot;What a haul!  What a haul!&quot; came the voice.  
&quot;The master?!&quot;  Soun and Genma said in unison as the ancient man came 
bounding into the room.  
&quot;Well hello Soun old boy.  Genma!  What have you been up to in my absence?&quot; 
the old pervert asked.  
&quot;Nothing, master.&quot; Genma replied.  
&quot;Good, good.  Hmmmm...&quot; Happosai said as he glanced back to his pack of 
stolen women&#39; undergarments.  
&quot;Hmmmm, maybe I didn&#39;t get as many as I thought...&quot; he mumbled aloud as 
he saw that the pack was not completely full.  
&quot;Genma, Soun.  Come with me, I feel it&#39;s time for you to continue your 
training.  Come, and let us liberate the darlings from their cruel owners.&quot;
	In as noble and courageous gesture Genma and Soun ever made against 
thier master, they stood up together and refused.  
&quot;I&#39;m sorry master, I cannot help you perpetrate this perversion.&quot; Soun said, 
his eyes closed in a firm face.  
&quot;Yes, we will not move from this spot.&quot; Genma added.  
&quot;Good, then you can eat breakfast with us.&quot; said Kasumi cheerfully.  
&quot;Yes, we will sit here and-&quot; Soun continued, his expression unchanging  
until he interpreted Kasumi&#39;s statement.  He glanced quickly at the green 
glop in front of him, noting that the substance seemed to be growing 
in size, and then over to Genma who had made a similar glance to his own 
plate.  Reading each other&#39;s eyes, their attitude changed drastically. 
&quot;-go with you, master!&quot; Soun recovered the sentence rather poorly, but his 
exuberance was more than enough to make it sound at least somewhat viable.  
Anything was better than Akane&#39;s cooking in his opinion.  
&quot;Yes, it might be fun!&quot; Genma added.  It was probably the most outright lie   
they had ever heard.  
&quot;Alright! Let&#39;s go then, boys!&quot; Happosai said as he bounded out the door, 
immediately followed by the two younger men.  
	Ranma and the three sisters watched speechless as the men went out 
the door.  It was a moment later that Ranma realized what was happening and 
immediately made his move to escape.  
&quot;Hey you guys, wait up!&quot;
	Jumping up from his kneeling position and launching off the table as 
he went, Ranma made his escape through the door.  
	Akane just watched blankly as he ran out the door.  After a long 
moment of piecing together her short term memory, she was furious.  
&quot;Hey, you&#39;re not getting away that easily!&quot; Akane yelled as she moved 
towards the door.  She made it two steps before she tripped over Nabiki&#39;s 
leg and crashed to the ground with a thump.  
&quot;Ow!&quot; the girl complained from the floor.  
&quot;Akane, they&#39;re gone.&quot; Nabiki said without raising her head from the comic.  

-=-=-=-=-

&quot;Well, we&#39;ve had a successful four-year run.  We&#39;ve had some good times, and 
we&#39;ve had some bad times.  I hope, that we can all carry this experience 
with us for the rest of our lives...&quot; the man babbled on at the head table.  
Ukyou was completely amazed at the absurd sentimentalism this man seemed to 
hold.  
&quot;He&#39;s been talking about nothing for nearly an hour!&quot; she whispered, &quot;How 
can they stand it?&quot;
	As Ukyou looked around, she realized that many of them weren&#39;t; some 
slept in their seats, some appeared to be developing nervous twitches, and 
some were glancing increasingly often between the speaker and the oversized
bronze baseball bats they had just received for trophies.  
&quot;...and so, let us eat together this delicious Okonomiyaki that this 
restaurant has provided.&quot;
	All abnormal actions seemed to cease at the thought of food.  
&quot;Well, here&#39;s the extra that guy paid for.&quot; she mumbled.  
	Immediately, Ukyou went into action.  Flinging the Okonomiyaki from 
her grill she sent the food flying onto the table, each with less than an 
inch waver in accuracy.  After she was done, the speaker raised his 
hand to speak again.  Ukyou leaned back against the counter behind her where 
the excess batter was stored to listen to the boring man speak.  
&quot;Alright then, let us eat.  And let us all remember...&quot; the man went on for 
several minutes during which no one knows or cares what was said.  
	After he was finished, the team immediately began to devour their 
food.  Within a minute, every piece of yaki made was gone into the stomachs 
of the men.  
	Silence.  Ukyou looked around with unease, some of the men stared 
into space, some blinked repeatedly, others shook their heads vigorously.  
It was as if they were trying to rid themselves of posession of some 
evil spirit.  
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked aloud in a concerned voice.  
	The heads of the men twisted instantly to look at the source of the 
feminine voice.  Then, they began to stand.  One after another they rose 
from their tables and began to walk towards the only girl in the 
restaurant...

-=-=-=-=-

	Ranma jogged along one of the commercial streets of Nerima.  He had 
long since ditched the three older men, using them only for an excuse for 
escape from breakfast at the Tendos, as lame as the excuse might be.  
&quot;I&#39;m still hungry, though.&quot; he said, looking around as he ran.  
	 As if on cue, Ranma found his answer and veered his course off in 
the direction of Ucchan&#39;s parlor.  Upon reaching the door he saw a sign that 
seemed out of place.  Looking at it, he realized it said &quot;Private party.&quot;
&quot;Huh, Ucchan must have gotten something special for this, she never does 
private parties.&quot; he said, pondering for a moment whether he should go in 
or not.  He decided a moment later and opened the doors to the parlor.  When 
he entered it was clear something was amiss.  
	A bunch of men, varying somewhat in age were all standing, facing 
towards the counter where Ucchan stood, holding her spatula in hand.  She 
was yelling at the mass of men, seemingly facing off against the mob.  
&quot;Hey, Ucchan!&quot;  Ranma called to her, &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; 
&quot;Ranma!&quot; Ukyou called to him, her voice making it evident she was in 
trouble.  &quot;These guys are coming after me!&quot;
	That was all Ranma needed to know.  His martial arts skills 
immediately kicked in and he began dropping guys like lightning.  
	Starting from the back, Ranma began kicking out knees and throwing 
men left and right.  Ranma felt that something was wrong, these guys weren&#39;t 
really paying attention to him or even trying to break thier own falls.  All 
their attention was completely focused to the front, he realized, to Ucchan 
who was now desperately trying to fight them off.  
	As quickly as he could, Ranma arrived at the front of the mob.  
&quot;Ucchan, we gotta get out of here!&quot; he said, grabbing her arm without 
waiting for a reply and pulling her quickly out the aisle of dropped men he 
had made coming in.  Just as quickly, they were out the door, the men all 
turning their heads sluggishly to follow the movement.  They moved to 
pursue, but by the time the first had made it out the door Ranma and Ucchan 
were nowhere to be found.

&quot;Good, we&#39;re out of there.&quot; Ranma said to her in a low tone.  
&quot;But we&#39;re right back in the same building!&quot; Ukyou protested, pointing out 
the fact that they her apartment is directly above the parlor.  
&quot;What better place to hide?  They&#39;d never expect us to be here.&quot; he replied 
without worry.  &quot;Now, what was with those guys?&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; Ukyou exclaimed, they just sort of all suddenly stood up and 
came towards me.&quot;
&quot;For no reason?&quot; 
&quot;No reason at all.&quot; 
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Ranma thought for a moment, &quot;Who were they?&quot;
&quot;Just some sandlot baseball team,&quot; Ukyou replied.  &quot;The owner must have had 
some money, because they paid me a lot to host a party here.&quot;
	Ranma seemed lost in thought, but after a moment became frustrated 
and shook his head to signify he was giving up.  
&quot;You never were much of a thinker, Ran-chan.&quot; she commented.  

-=-=-=-=-

	Minutes later, Ranma and Ukyou walked downstairs into the parlor and  
immediately took a fighting stance, ready for the mass of men they still 
thought inhabited Ucchans.  They were immediately relieved to find no one 
in the restaurant.  
&quot;They&#39;re gone.&quot; Ukyou said as she put her spatula away.  
&quot;Huh, too bad.&quot; Ranma commented, relaxing his stance.  Then, glancing at the 
grill, he remembered what he had originally came to the restaurant for.  
&quot;I&#39;m starved.&quot;
	Ukyou looked at him and smiled.  
&quot;Me too, I&#39;ll make some Okonomiyaki for the both of us.&quot;
	Ranma waited as best he could for Ukyou to make the food.  He never 
was much for patients, and the hunger in his belly was really getting to 
him.  Ucchan looked at him from her grill and smiled again.  
&quot;It takes time, Ran-chan.  You just have to be patient.&quot; 
	He merely grunted his response and she smiled for the third time.  
In what seemed like forever to Ranma (but in reality about five minutes) 
the long waited for Okonomiyaki had arrived.  After placing the dish 
(complete with a heart-shaped okonomiyaki) in front of him she walked around 
the counter, placed another plate next to him and sat down.  Ranma 
completely engulfed his plate and was finished by the time Ucchan had eaten 
a bite or two.  
&quot;That was delicious, Ucchan.&quot; he said to her.  She looked up at him, her 
mouth still full from the last bite and nodded her thanks.  
	She looked down to her plate and began to take another bite when 
she sensed something to her left.  Looking up, Ukyou saw Ranma staring at 
her blankly.  
&quot;Ran-chan?&quot; she asked, quizzically.  
&quot;Ukyou, you&#39;re... beautiful.&quot; he said.  
	Ukyou&#39;s mouth hung open.  
&quot;Ran...chan...Arigatou!&quot; she managed to get out without breath.  She gazed 
up at his eyes, and seemed affixed to them for some reason she could not 
figure out.  He put his hand on her shoulder, she could feel her body tingle 
at his touch, and a feeling deep inside of her come alive; one she had once 
repressed, but now felt exciting to her.  
	She held out her hand and he took it, electricity flowing between 
them, making their bodies shudder with chills.  
&quot;Ukyou...I...feel so...&quot; Ranma said, feeling his rock hard penis pushing 
painfully against the front of his clothing.  
	Ukyou smiled at him, feeling the same urgency in her own way.  
&quot;I know... I feel the same way...&quot; she told him, almost giggling girlishly.  
	Ranma looked as if he was fighting something in his head for a 
long moment.  
&quot;Ucchan, can we...I mean, I know it&#39;s not right, but...&quot; he said akwardly, 
but the statement was obviously phrased as a question.  
	Ukyou&#39;s mind told her no, something was wrong here, but her body 
screamed for her to go for it.  She conceded, realizing not only from 
herself, but from Ranma&#39;s reaction it would be a losing battle.  She 
nodded, fear and hesitation brodcasting in the movement.  
&quot;...but, upstairs.&quot; 
	He bobbed his head in an equally awkward, but slightly energetic 
manner in agreement.  

-=-=-=-

	Akane was disappointed.  Ranma had run out on her, leaving her alone 
with her sisters without eating the meal she had prepared and so she looked 
around the room sadly.  
&quot;He left.  He didn&#39;t even try my cooking.&quot; she lamented too loudly under her 
breath.  
&quot;Akane, Nabiki and I are still here.&quot; Kasumi tried to cheer her up, hearing 
her comment.  
	Nabiki looked at Kasumi in a panicked gesture of protest, not liking 
what Kasumi was insinuating.  
&quot;We&#39;ll eat your cooking.  Won&#39;t we, Nabiki?&quot; Kasumi said, the second half of 
the statement phrased in a tone that might, were it not Kasumi, be 
interpreted as threatening.  
	The middle Tendo sister let her head fall limply to her chest and 
her protest go unheard.  One could not argue with Kasumi.  
	Kasumi sat down in front of her plate and quickly picked up a small 
piece of the food and placed it quickly, but carefully into her mouth.  
&quot;Mmmmmm... different!&quot; her voice wavered only slightly, almost making the 
statement sound completely positive.  
	Kasumi looked at Nabiki, smiling serenely.  
&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to have some?&quot;
	Nabiki tried her best to keep her composure for her younger sister&#39;s 
sake, but she still seemed nervous as she took a taste of the green dish.  
&quot;Mmmmmm....&quot; she said, the middle of the expresion rising and then falling 
artificially.  
	Akane did not miss the significance.  
&quot;Are you sure you really like it?&quot; she asked, skeptically.  
&quot;Why don&#39;t you try it yourself, Akane?&quot; Nabiki smiled as nicely as she 
possibly could.  
	What a concept.  Akane shrugged, sat down, and took a taste for 
herself.  It was gooey, the pepper corns she had substituted for raisins 
gave the whole dish a very strong taste, and the Worcester sauce she added 
to the gelatin mix made it slightly....tangy?
	Akane gagged hard, and wondered how her sisters had managed to keep 
as much face as they had.  It was one of the worst things she had ever 
tasted.  
&quot;It&#39;s really bad, isn&#39;t it?&quot; she asked, not looking up once she had 
recovered from her gag reflex.  
&quot;It&#39;s not-&quot; Kasumi started, but Akane stopped by raising a hand mid 
sentence.  
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Kasumi, you don&#39;t have to.&quot;
	They sat there for a moment; Akane looking at the ground, Kasumi 
sitting, looking concerned, and Nabiki trying to avoid interaction by 
looking disinterestedly at her comic.  
	Almost simultaneously, the girls all shuddered involuntarily.  As 
if a heat wave had washed over their bodies, concentrating at their 
midsections.  Akane was shocked at the way she felt.  &lt;What IS this?&gt;  She 
looked up at her sisters, nervously.  Somewhat to her relief, and 
astonishment, Kasumi looked at her with a similar mask.  Akane glanced over 
at Nabiki who was looking at Kasumi, the same nervous tension shown on her 
face.  The oldest sister glanced from Akane to Nabiki and, seeing the same 
reaction she felt, spoke.  
&quot;Oh, my.&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Akane asked, shifting her weight and trying to get more 
comfortable with the changes coming over her.  
&quot;I don&#39;t know, sis.  It seems we&#39;re all feeling the same way, though.&quot; 
Nabiki said.    
&quot;This feeling is so....strong...&quot; Akane said.  
&quot;I agree... what should we do?&quot; Kasumi asked, innocence obvious in her 
voice.  
	They were silent.  Nabiki broke the silence with something that 
neither of the other two expected to hear.  
&quot;Well, the only thing we can do.&quot;  Nabiki said slyly.  The sisters looked at 
each other in confusion.  
&quot;You don&#39;t mean...&quot; Akane said to her, getting a hint as to what her sister 
was getting at, her eyebrows lowering slightly.  
&quot;Of course, I do.&quot; the girl replied again in her own sly way, &quot;Wait here a 
moment and I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;  
	Kasumi and Akane looked at each other, both a little nervous at what 
the middle sister was implying, and not completely sure of what she had in 
mind.  After about thirty seconds of waiting, Nabiki returned to the other 
two, a small cloth bag in her hand.  
&quot;Well, I&#39;m back.&quot; she said.  
	The other two sisters looked at her, still unsure of how to react, 
and curious about the contents of the bag.  Nabiki smiled, knowing Akane and 
Kasumi were both more naive about sex than she was.  
&quot;Well, we better get going.&quot;  
	Akane&#39;s face crinkled slightly, a little angry.  
&quot;Nabiki, in that bag.  There isn&#39;t a...&quot;
&quot;dildo?&quot; Nabiki interjected with a smirk.  
&quot;...is there?&quot; she finished.  
	Akane was a little shocked.  Kasumi reacted how any proper girl 
should, she put her hand to her face to cover her mouth and said the words 
that always conveyed her distress.  
&quot;Oh, my.&quot;
	The youngest Tendo sister felt an immediate wave of anxiety wash 
over her.  But, as was normal for Akane, it was immediately masked as 
anger.  
&quot;What kind of hentai are you, Nabiki?!&quot; she said harshly, stepping in front 
of her older sister.  
	Nabiki merely reached out her hand very swiftly and lightly 
grasped the younger girls left breast in her hand, caressing it slightly.  
Akane was frozen, Nabiki held her hand firmly planted on her chest, an 
action she would have immediately responded to by flattening the 
transgressor were it a boy, but she was quite confused by the fact that her 
own sister was making the gesture.  
	This was a very delicate spot, Nabiki realized.  Well knowing that 
only respect for her was keeping Akane from stomping her flat.  She also 
knew that that respect would be quickly bypassed if Akane became angry 
enough.  She would have to just keep talking to her.  
&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here.. but I know that if you both feel like I 
do right now, your body is very hot all over... especially down there...&quot; 
Nabiki took a slight gamble and slowly rubbed her hand down over the lower 
part of the girl&#39;s dress.  Akane&#39;s knees jerked slightly as she did so, and 
Nabiki decided to withdraw her hand for the meantime.  
&quot;I know that fighting this emotion can be less than pleasant, Akane... it 
might be a good idea not to try.&quot;
	The youngest Tendo simply stared, wide eyed and mouth wide open as 
Nabiki returned to fondling her breast through the blouse.  It felt so good, 
the heat from her lower region seemed to spread up her body, concentrating 
on the place where her older sister touched her breasts.  She could only 
sigh slightly as she felt her nipples become erect under the touch.  Behind 
her she heard a familiar voice repeat itself.  
&quot;Oh, my.&quot;
	Nabiki smiled as she both saw and felt Akane&#39;s reaction.  She went 
further and let the bag fall to the ground in favor of reaching out to 
Akane&#39;s other breast.  The girl made no protest as the second hand was 
placed next to the first.  
	After a long moment of continued fondling, Akane tried to speak.  
&quot;I...Nabiki...you...&quot;
	Nabiki took her right hand from Akane to put a finger over her 
mouth, indicating her to be quiet.  Taking both hands from their positions, 
Nabiki knelt down on the floor and placed her hands on Akane&#39;s hips lightly,
pulling her down.  Once the girl complied, Nabiki slowly reached her hands 
behind her own back and unhooked her blouse.  
	Akane gazed on as Nabiki bared clear, her chest.  Nabiki&#39;s bust was 
impressive, larger than Akane&#39;s and well formed and Akane felt some jealousy 
as she looked at her sister.  
	Nabiki motioned for Akane to do the same.  After a long moment of 
hesitation, the girl took the bottom of her blouse and pulled it over her 
head.  Both girls just sat there for a moment, looking only at each other, 
staring at the exposed flesh between them.  Somewhere in the background, a 
sigh of &quot;Oh, my...&quot; went unheard.  
	Nabiki reached down then to Akane&#39;s own hand, grasping it gently she 
lead the younger girl&#39;s touch to her own busom.  Akane was a little uneasy 
about this, a part of her mind told her she was doing something wrong, but 
at the same time another part of her was almost overwhelmingly pushing her  
to follow Nabiki&#39;s lead.  
	The same smile remained constant on the middle sister&#39;s face.  The 
sly, confidant smile that always made the others nervous about who was 
really in control of any given situation.  
	The smiling face shuddered for a moment and a slight gasp 
escaped the girl&#39;s lips as Akane found her nipples.  The younger Tendo 
looked up, scared that she had done something wrong and Nabiki&#39;s grin 
relieved her that she had not.  Right now, Akane didn&#39;t think she could 
bear to do something clumsy and ruin the sensations that she felt running 
through her body, as she fondled her older sister&#39;s breasts.
	As they continued with their sex play, the two sisters found 
themselves closer to the ground.  Once there, Nabiki took control.  She 
positioned Akane on her back and immediately pushed up the skirt worn by 
the younger Tendo.  
&quot;Nabiki, wha..?&quot; she tried to protest, being very nervous about the whole 
new situation.  
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, this will feel great.&quot;

-=-=-=-=-

	Ranma and Ucchan were completely engorged in their fornication.  
Once upstairs, the couple had wasted no time to get down to business, 
striping and positioned on her futon for the upcoming act.  The urgency they 
felt pushed them forward and already they were ready to go to the final 
step.  
	From lying on his back Ranma looked up at Ukyou as she strattled his 
stomach.  Their eyes locked for a moment as she looked down, smiled and 
put her face up to his to kiss him firmly on the mouth.  The feeling was 
very pleasant and it lingered for long moments after she sat back up.  
	Ukyou was ready, without any further delay she reached around the 
back and grabbed his rock hard penis firmly in her hand.  He merely laid 
there as she brought herself over it and then, placing it at her entrance 
sat down quickly.  
	Ukyou closed her eyes and bit her lip to stifle a scream as his 
member tore through her barrier.  She had no idea it would be this painful.  
Ranma immediately saw her reaction and moved to try to help her.  She put up 
a hand to stop him.  
&quot;No,&quot; she said definitively.  Ucchan had dreamed about this, she would not 
chicken out because of a little pain.  In fact, as she thought about it, the 
pain was slowly fading from her lower region.  
	Ranma was still dubious about what was happening to Ukyou.  He knew 
from somewhere that the first time always hurt girls, but the amount of pain 
that she apparently had felt seemed to be extreme.  It took a lot to make 
Ukyou wince, and her reaction definitely had shown.  He had always been 
brought up not to hurt girls, and it truly wounded him to have harmed one as 
special to him as Ukyou.  
	On the other hand, he was truly in heaven.  Ranma could not believe 
the sensations of the inside of the girl&#39;s tight vagina.  There had been 
some hard pressure at first, but that had quickly given way to more 
pleasurable pressure that squeezed him from all directions.  
	His pleasure intensified even more as Ukyou began to slowly move him 
in and out of her.  It was still painful for her, but the potion in her body 
as well as the determination in her brain would not let her give up.  Ranma 
gasped as his prick began to withdraw from her and then reenter her up to 
the hilt.  

-=-=-=-=-

	Akane was in bliss as she approached orgasm.  The contractions of 
her muscles were pushing her further and further into Nabiki&#39;s face.  The 
middle member of the Tendo clan knew it what was coming, and just before 
Akane began to convulse she moved her mouth up slightly and bit down on the 
girl&#39;s exposed clitoris.  
&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, AHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; she screamed out, her face contorted in 
pleasure and pain as she felt Nabiki pinch the tender button between her 
teeth.  
	Nabiki smiled with the rest of her face as she held on tightly to 
Akane&#39;s protruding bud until she finally stopped squirming.  Then, she 
released the girl and poked her head out from between Akane&#39;s legs.  
&quot;Akane, you aren&#39;t going to just lay there, are you?&quot; Nabiki asked in her 
customary semi-sarcastic fashion.  
	The younger girl barely heard her, so breathless from the act.  She 
stared absent-mindedly at the ceiling until she registered the question.  
&quot;Huh?&quot; she looked down at the girl looking up obscenely from between her 
legs.  
&quot;Well, isn&#39;t it time you returned the favor?&quot; Nabiki asked in a mock annoyed 
tone.  
&quot;Uhhh, well...okay...&quot; she replied weakly.  
&quot;Good!&quot; Nabiki said enthusiastically.  
	After several moments of rearranging, the positions were reversed   
and Nabiki&#39;s turn for pleasure was at hand.  Tentatively, as she had been 
during the whole affair, Akane began to eat out Nabiki.  Slowly, she licked 
the older girl&#39;s vaginal lips, soon covering them with a thin coating of 
saliva making the older girl squirm slightly and a slight amount of liquid 
to escape her hole.  
	Akane detected the taste of her honey and was a little surprised at 
it&#39;s presence.  She knew that she herself felt wet down there, especially 
when she had...what&#39;s the word, came?  Whatever it was, she had loved the 
feeling.  Now, as she tasted the juice a little she realized it wasn&#39;t too 
bad.  Deciding that she wanted to try some more - and remembering what 
Nabiki had done earlier - Akane gently pulled the petals apart and stuck her 
tongue inside.  
	Nabiki smiled and shuddered as Akane put her tongue inside her.  
Akane was quickly becoming adept at licking her, she realized.  
&lt;With a little practice, she would be incredible at this&gt; Nabiki thought 
with a smile.  A moment later she frowned, &lt;No, what am I thinking?  I don&#39;t 
even know WHY we are doing this.&gt;
	The end of Nabiki&#39;s thought was met almost simultaneously with a 
voice from the door.  
&quot;Oh, how cruel is the hand of fate that would drive my beloved Akane Tendo 
to this terrible crime against nature.&quot; spouted words that would only come 
from one mouth in Nerima.  
	Tatewaki Kuno stood behind Akane, a bouquet of flowers in his hand.  
Akane looked up to him in shock, quite embarrassed to be completely naked, 
eating out her sister.  A long moment of indecision took over her body.  
Kuno solved her problem by kneeling beside her and putting his hands around 
her waist, hands bumping against the bottom of her naked breasts.  
&quot;Oh, fair Akane.  Let me rescue from this foul depravity and let me take you 
to your bed and show you-&quot; had he been five minutes earlier, and had she not 
already orgasmed, Akane would have jumped on Kuno for sex, but as it was he 
was cut off by a punch to the face.  
	Akane was about to continue it with another shot when Nabiki touched 
her shoulder.  
&quot;Akane, hold on, let me&quot; she said.  
	The younger girl complied, moving aside so the middle Tendo could 
act.  She put her hand on the boy&#39;s shoulder and gently prodded his head up 
with her other hand.  
&quot;Oh, Nabiki Tendo...&quot; he said as he looked at her.  &quot;I have time not for 
you, for as I sit-&quot; 
	Kuno was cut short again, this time by a kiss.  He stared straight 
ahead as the girl in front of him until she finished the passionate touch.  
Without waiting for him to recover, she took control.  
&quot;Kuno baby, shut up and get down here,&quot;
	Akane watched as her sister seduced the boy she had always smacked 
away.  After a minute or two of foreplay, she glanced around and happened 
to see something that in the heat of their passion, both her and Nabiki had 
forgotten about: Kasumi.  
	The oldest Tendo daughter sat glancing back and forward between 
Akane and the couple getting it on next to her.  Akane noticed that Kasumi 
was as naked as she, and was thrusting fingers into her own womanhood.  
&quot;Akane, dear, would you be so kind as to help me?&quot; she asked.

-=-=-=-=-
	
	Ukyou felt as the last remaining pain from her body fade as her 
vagina beginning to stretch and lubricant was released to make his 
penetrations easier.  As these both happened she quickened her pace a 
little as the pleasure began to be felt.  
	The feeling was even more intense as Ranma thrust again and she 
began to leave all her inhibitions behind and started to truly enjoy the 
act.  
&quot;Oh, Ran-chan..&quot; she moaned.  
&quot;Ucchan...&quot; he moaned in response.  
	Ukyou then began to give her wild horse the ride of his life.  Her 
whole body began roughly humping up and down on his prick, making him 
slightly nervous that she might miss.  
	The girl did nothing to slow as she approached her limit, in fact, 
if anything she sped up.  Her thrusts became even more savage as she felt 
the clenching in her groin pushing her over the edge.  
	She clamped down and pushed him as far inside of her as she could as 
the orgasm hit.  It was like nothing she had ever experienced.  It was 
painfully hot in her groin; her head spun around, making her dizzy; and she 
felt her body fall apart like a reverberating guitar string.  
	Ranma could not take any more of her stimulation.  He had been near 
the edge before, and when he felt the excess fluid flow from her hole to 
drip on his balls he knew it was too much.  Without any ceremony he pushed 
against her, his body fully locked into hers as he shot his load of sperm 
all the way inside her.  
	With the waves of pleasure, Ukyou did not cease when she felt his 
seed splash deep into her hole.  The foreign fluid was hot within her inner 
walls and the idea of it there kept her going for a couple moments longer.  
	Then, when the pleasure had faded and Ranma became soft, Ukyou 
remained on top of Ranma, lying against him caringly.  
&quot;I love you Ran-chan...&quot;
&quot;I... love you too... Ucchan...&quot;

-=-=-=-=-=-

&quot;Go ahead Akane..&quot; Kasumi said as she readied herself.  
&quot;Are you sure, Onechan?&quot; 
&quot;Hai,&quot; she smiled at the younger Tendo.  
&quot;Alright,&quot; Akane said as she as she readied her arm.  &quot;Here I go..&quot;
	Kasumi made a cry of pain as the dildo thrust into her cunt.  
&quot;Oh! Gomen, Onechan!&quot; Akane said immediately, scared that she had 
hurt her older sister.  
	Kasumi steadied herself as she collected an answer.  
&quot;It...It&#39;s alright Akane, I was just startled a bit...Please, continue,&quot;
	Akane looked her in the eye and she stared reassuringly back.  
Slowly, she removed the dildo.  Akane watched in horror as it pulled from 
her body.  
&quot;Kasumi!  There&#39;s blood...&quot; she said, panicking.  
	Kasumi smiled slightly.  
&quot;It&#39;s normal for the first time Akane.  Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; she replied, 
&quot;Please, continue.&quot;
	Akane&#39;s fear did not disappear, but complied to her sisters request.  
	Kasumi began to fondle her breasts as Akane thrust the rubber lover 
into her body.  The dildo was not only long, but it was bigger around than 
almost all human males, and the pressure inside her was great at first.  
Never before had she ever felt this way, never so excited about anything.  
&lt;Oh! I guess I can&#39;t complain about Ranma sneaking into Akane&#39;s bedroom 
anymore&gt; she thought.  
	The girl moaned as Akane sped up the frequency of the thrusts.  
Before long, Kasumi felt the ecstasy of an orgasm come over her body.  Her 
back arched and she pushed her legs together tightly, trapping Akane&#39;s hand 
as well as the dildo in place until she was done.  
&quot;Arigatou, Akane-san... &quot;
&quot;No problem, Kasumi!&quot; she smiled at her sister.  
	As they got up, the two began to watch Kuno and Nabiki in their 
lovemaking.  She was now lying on the table face up, the food spilled over 
the table behind her.  This seemed to be the least of their worries.  
	Kuno was taking her missionary style, his cock pounding hard into 
her at the end of the table.  He was holding her hips with an iron grip and 
was pulling her body against him hard every time he thrust in, impaling 
her hard with every pull.  Nabiki seemed to be enjoying it thoroughly, the 
expression on her face showed the pure ecstasy from this rough ride that was 
given to her.  
&quot;Nabiki Tendo, I fear that the coup de grace is soon to arrive...&quot;  he said 
with a hard grimace evident on his face.  
&quot;Go for it, Kuno baby.&quot; she said, putting her arms on his hands as they 
gripped harder on her hips.  Her lust a hundred times as strong as it had 
been earlier.  
	Kuno put his muscle to work, pushing back and forth with an almost 
bestial fervor.  He piston the hard steel spear into her again and again, 
her ass sliding, well lubricated in some of Akane&#39;s green glop.  
	He did not last for long.  Soon after he said it, Tatewaki did come. 
He shot his entire load as he continued to thrust, not stopping even for his 
climax.  One glob came as he thrust deep inside, the second as he exited, 
and a third and fourth as he pulled her back to him.  Even after he had 
stopped spurting, the boy did not relent in his thrusting.  
	Nabiki felt the fluid spray within her, it was both disgusting and 
arousing at the same time but the feeling turned her on so much she felt the 
waves of pleasure fast approaching.  
	Akane and Kasumi watched as Kuno rammed their sister even after it 
was evident he came.  It was like watching a boy playing roughly with a 
doll, as easily as he pushed her back and forth on him.  She seemed weak and 
helpless against him, like a plaything.  The only thing that made the 
sisters wonder was Nabiki&#39;s smile.  The smile that changed everything, the 
cat-like smile that belied everything else in the scene.  
	Less than a minute after Kuno came, Nabiki knew her own was 
imminent.  She moaned out loud, making it known that he was doing her right.  
&quot;Oh, Kuno!&quot; 
	Kuno slowed not at all, continuing to hammer the little brunette for 
his own pleasure.  The pleasure he knew had almost completely returned, and 
very soon he would feel again.  
	The girl beat him to it, Nabiki screamed out loud as her body 
explode in satisfaction.  Her body hurt, her mind screamed, nothing else 
mattered to her.  The lust was all-encompasing, and it would not let her go 
until she came.  
	Kuno felt the reaction he had caused on her and was immediately 
proud of his achievement.  The knowledge that he was adequate to pleasure a 
woman in this way was the push that caused him to lose his load for the 
second time today.  
	Finally, after the violent ordeal was finally over, they relaxed.  
&quot;Kuno baby, that was incredible.&quot;
&quot;Thank you, you honor me by your words Nabiki Tendo&quot;
	Kuno looked down at her, her face bright and smiling.  She nodded 
and a moment later Kuno felt a sharp pain and then collapsed into 
unconsciousness.  
&quot;Nice shot, sis.&quot; Nabiki commented, looking up at the girl holding the 
mallet in her hands.  
&quot;Thank you.&quot; said Akane, smiling.

Author&#39;s Notes:
-=-=-=-=-

	Okay, this chapter was longer and had more gratuitous sex than any 
other that has come before, and probably will ever exist after.  This 
chapter is long because it had to be to get three lemon scenes in, and 
because I was in the mood when I started to write something extensive.  
Unfortunately, the mood did not return to me thereafter, and that is why 
it took so long to finish this chapter.  
	Okay, the part about Nabiki and the Vikings.  I read once in the 
Ranma 1/2 Drinking game: 

If Nabiki is having sex, but is interrupted by rampaging Vikings bent on 
conquest, 8 drinks (I think it&#39;s 8)
	
	I have no idea where it came from, but I thought it was absolutely 
hilarious.  I have no intention of offending the author of the original fic 
by writing this.  

To the author: if you are upset by me using this in my fic, contact me at 
		the address below and I will work something out with you.  

	Alright, also, my disclaimers and such have been changing slightly 
as I go along, simply because they reflect what I am thinking about at the 
time.  They are in no means meant to be offensive to Takahashi-sama.  I have 
nothing but the utmost respect for her and all the companies involved in 
the production/distribution of Ranma (except Viz ^^).
	Okay, so I&#39;ve pretty much said I don&#39;t want to offend people.  
Fine, I&#39;ve covered my ass for the authorities.  If any of the rest of you 
were offended by this story, too bad; there *WAS* a disclaimer at the top, 
if you didn&#39;t notice.  
	Other than that, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be writing the next part very 
soon.  I&#39;ve got too much going on in my life right now, and I need some time 
to work on painting and learning C/C++, Java, Java Script and Perl even 
better (Yes, I&#39;m a programmer).

Production time:

God, I didn&#39;t keep even close track this time. 

Probably between 6 and 10 hours.  
Revision Time: probably &#39;bout 3 hours.
