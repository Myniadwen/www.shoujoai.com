Episode 3:  The Gymnastics Match

Kasumi:  &quot;I&#39;m home.&quot;
Soun:  &quot;How was your first day of work, Kasumi?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Slow.  We had a lot of cancellations for some reason.&quot;
Soun:  &quot;And what did you do all day?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;We went over the patient files and translated some of 
        Shampoo&#39;s chinese entries.  Then Dr. Tofu took me to 
        lunch.  And then we spent the rest of the day finishing the 
        job.&quot;
Soun:  &quot;That&#39;s good.  And how are things going between you and 
Dr. Tofu?  Is he ready to propose yet?&quot; 
Kasumi:  &quot;Daddy!  We&#39;ve only been dating for four days!&quot;

***************

The Martial Arts Rhythmic Gymnastics Meet between St. Bacchus 
School for Girls and Furinkan High School was set one week in the 
future and Kodachi had to properly prepare for it.  She took a look 
around her and saw the rest of the team were sparring on the mats.  
She clapped her hands.
 
Immediately the doors to the gym were slammed shut, locked, and 
her teammates lined up in front of her.  None of them looked at her 
directly, as they had been taught.  Kodachi picked out her second-in-
command, who was someone who knew what she liked and could 
get her there quickly.  Her teammates knew the drill.

The girl she picked out meekly thanked her, and the two next to her 
came forward and started to remove the leotard from Kodachi&#39;s 
body.  When they finished, the girl immediately lowered her body 
between her legs and started to use her mouth and fingers to bring 
Kodachi off.

If Kodachi had thought about it, she would have admitted that part 
of her arousal was due to being able to command someone to do this 
to her; some of it was due to doing it in front of an audience; and 
some of it was doing it with another girl.  Breaking the rules and 
getting away with it, and she had been getting away with it for some 
time.

Under the skilled fingers and tongue of her teammate, Kodachi 
quickly came.  She was quickly cleaned and walked to the showers.  
Her designated washers were waiting for her with soapy towels, and 
they scrubbed her body as she stepped into the hot stream.

Kodachi let the water run over her body, relaxing and refreshing it.  
She stood there for a minute longer, then walked back into the 
gymnasium to let her towelers dried her body, then they helped her 
into her school dress.  Kodachi watched as the teammate who gave 
brought her to orgasm satisfied herself by plunging a dildo into her 
own body as the others watched enviously.  Everyone knew the rules 
- that only the team captain and the one who gave her pleasure 
would be allowed release, and the others would have to wait until 
they returned home, under penalty of being &#39;disciplined&#39; during a 
sleepover at Kodachi&#39;s house.

Her second-in-command screamed in release as her juices flowed 
from her body.  After she had sufficiently recovered, Kodachi left 
the rest of the session to her second, then left to search for the 
Furinkan High team. 

***************

Kasumi and Nabiki sat on Akane&#39;s bed, or, more accurately, her 
mattress on the floor.

Nabiki:  &quot;So.  Is Ranma going to do anything about Ranko?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;They&#39;re taking a walk downtown together.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Is Ranko still depressed over Shampoo leaving?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Kasumi, she&#39;s gone on a rampage.  She flirts with 
        everyone except Kuno, and he almost always attacks the 
        guy after she leaves.  Ranko returns to beat him up, and 
        when he&#39;s unconscious she leaves him on the ground with 
        an erection.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Oh.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;He now has a reputation for being a sado-masochist.  I 
        think that&#39;s going a little too far.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Well, last night I asked Ranma to talk to her.  And if that 
        doesn&#39;t work Auntie Nodoka is supposed to be reappearing 
        tonight.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;How are things going between you and Ranma?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Fine, fine.&quot;  [smiling]  &quot;I think this whole engagement 
        thing is going to work out.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;How about...&quot; [spreads her legs]
Akane:  &quot;We haven&#39;t done it since the night Shampoo left.  He says 
        he wants to rest a little more, but I think he&#39;s got something 
        planned for tonight.  Kasumi&#39;s probably getting more than I 
        am.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Yeah, &#39;Nurse Kasumi&#39;.  Is Dr. Tofu any good?&quot;
Kasumi:  [smiling]  &quot;I like him.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;I bet.  Are you going to share him with your sisters?&quot;

Kasumi took some more teasing about her date with Dr. Tofu.

***************

The vendor looked at the sight in front of him.  Twins!  He almost 
felt his nose starting to bleed. 

Vendor:  &quot;You two are such sweet girls!  Here, have another bun 
        each - for free!&quot;
Ranma and Ranko:  &quot;Ooo!  Golly!  Thank you so much!&quot;

The vendor turned around and chuckled to himself as he saw 
himself in between the naked bodies of his customers.

Vendor:  &quot;Are the two of you busy tonight?  Perhaps we could get 
        together for a date.&quot;

The vendor turned back around and saw irate female customers 
swinging their purses in a circle.  They started to hit him.

Customers:  &quot;You pervert!&quot;

***************

Ranko:  &quot;See, I told you.  Guys will give you more stuff simply 
        because you&#39;re a girl.&quot;

Ranko and Ranma walked through the street eating their pork buns.  
They eventually made their way to an empty lot and sat in a section 
of concrete pipe.

Ranma:  &quot;Everyone&#39;s worried about you.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;About what?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;You keep flirting with guys so you can beat up Kuno.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I&#39;m just trying to give him a hint to leave me alone.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;He&#39;s not getting the hint.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;He&#39;s not very smart.&quot;

The twins finished eating, then lay with their backs to the wall, 
facing each other.

Ranma:  &quot;So are you going to keep on doing it?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  Except for a few die-hards, most of Akane&#39;s 
        following latched onto me when they found out that you 
        were married.  None have come out to ask me except Kuno.  
        And he thinks that dating him would be a privilege.  What 
        a jerk!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What about Shampoo?&quot;

Ranko is silent for a moment.

Ranko:  &quot;Do you remember in training when I did you as a guy and 
        you were a girl?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Yeah.  That was weird.  I don&#39;t know why mom made us 
        do that.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Do you ever feel like doing it again?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;No.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I did with Shampoo after we did each other as girls.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Oh.  What about Ryoga?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I wanted him inside me...  Do you think I&#39;m weird for 
        wanting to do it with both of them?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I... No.  I mean, Akane does it with both of my forms.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;So do I.&quot;

Ranko leans over and kisses Ranma, both of them for a moment 
embracing and cupping the other&#39;s breast in their hand.

Ranko:  &quot;Can you imagine what everyone would say if they knew we 
        had made love?  Now I know why we&#39;re a secret art.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I guess.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;So are you and Akane going to do it tonight?&quot;
Ranma:  [blushing]  &quot;Yeah, I wanted it to be just us since there&#39;s no 
        school tomorrow.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re still blushing.  Well, I&#39;ll go see Nabiki 
        and Kasumi, then.  But for now...&quot;
 
Ranko slipped a hand down Ranma&#39;s pants and underneath his 
boxers to lightly penetrate Ranma&#39;s pussy lips.  Ranma returned the 
favor and drew his sister in for another kiss.
 
Ranma:  &quot;It feels strange not having Akane here.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;You&#39;re so in love with her.&quot;
 
They heard some voices in the lot and quickly straightened 
themselves out, peeking out the ends of the pipe.

***************

Kodachi finally tracked down the Furinkan High team as they left a 
small sidewalk vendor.  They noticed her following them (as she 
had meant them to) and ducked into a empty lot.  Kodachi followed 
and easily repelled the &quot;surprise&quot; attack.

Kodachi used her ribbon to punish them for daring to be her 
opponents.  She was surprised when someone grabbed the ribbon out 
of the air.

Ranma:  &quot;Hey, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s enough?&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;You caught my ribbon.  You&#39;re no ordinary girl.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Well.  Yeah.  You could say that.&quot;

Kodachi discarded the ribbon, kicked a baton into the air and 
grabbed it, lunging at her opponent in chinese clothes.  Ranma 
avoided the blow and spun around as Kodachi somersaulted past 
him.  Ranko placed her fist in midair.  Kodachi almost hit it as she 
completed her somersault, jumping away at the last second.

Kodachi:  &quot;I didn&#39;t even feel you.  You&#39;re both quite good.  I am 
        Kodachi, the Black Rose of the St. Bacchus School for 
        Girls.  Please don&#39;t forget.&quot;

Kodachi threw a black rose to each of her opponents and bounced 
away, laughing.

***************

The three girls were from Furinkan High and asked Ranma to take 
their place in the match the next week, (a little confused at the 
&#39;twins&#39;) thinking he was Ranko.  Ranma said he would think about 
it.  On the way home, Ranma and Ranko felt someone following 
them (as she had intended) and they caught glimpses of Kodachi 
darting between corners.  When they reached the dojo, she stopped 
following them. 

***************

Everyone sat at the dinner table except Genma, who was lying 
exhausted in his room.  Nodoka congratulated Kasumi on her job, 
then got caught up with the rest of the news.  She resolved to talk to 
Ranko later about Shampoo, feeling that something was left out.  
After dinner was finished, Ranma spent an hour or so in the room 
with everyone, watching TV, then spoke.

Ranma:  &quot;I&#39;m feeling a little tired.  So I guess I&#39;ll take a bath and 
        then go to bed.  Are you coming, Akane?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;What?  Oh.  Yes.&quot;
Soun:  &quot;They&#39;re getting along so well!&quot;

***************

Ranko cried as she hugged Nodoka.  Nodoka had gradually gotten 
the story of how Shampoo had come to kill Ranko and ended up 
making love to her.  She could tell that Ranko was in love with her.  
The first rejection was always the hardest.

Nodoka:  &quot;Some people need time to sort out their feelings, Ranko.  
        Making love to someone of their own sex can be a scary 
        thing for some.  If she feels the same way that you do, she&#39;ll 
        return.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;But what about Ryoga?&quot;

Nodoka listened as Ranko told her about Ryoga.

Nodoka:  &quot;And do you think that you love him?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  I felt something when we were together 
        talking.  I wanted to...  But he disappeared before things 
        went anywhere.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Ranko, its not as common because its harder to hide, but 
        there have been lifelong threesomes and such in the past.  
        Do you think that both Ryoga and Shampoo would be 
        willing to try something like that?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Could you live with just one of them?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;
Nodoka:  [hugging Ranko to her]  &quot;My poor Ranko.  You&#39;re too 
        young for all this.&quot;

***************

Akane snuggled up to Ranma as they soaked in the bath.

Akane:  &quot;So what did you have planned?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Why don&#39;t you let me worry about that?  But I promise it&#39;ll 
        last the night.&quot;
Akane:  [smiling]  &quot;Your mother wants to meet with us in Ranko&#39;s 
        room first.&quot;

The two stepped out of the tub and dried themselves off.  They put 
on bathrobes and walked upstairs.

***************

Kasumi and Nabiki entered Ranko&#39;s room to find everyone waiting 
for them.  They sat in a circle, facing one another.

Kasumi:  &quot;What did you want to talk about, Auntie?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I wanted to talk about you, Kasumi, but Ranko&#39;s situation 
        is the same.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Me?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;You, and Dr. Tofu.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Oh.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Our Marital Arts Schools have been secret for many 
        years.  I know that you have taken Dr. Tofu as a lover, 
        Kasumi.  At some point you&#39;re going to have to decide 
        whether or not you want to reveal our school to him.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;I see.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;If you do, he must be bound by the same oath of silence 
        that we operate under, or else be killed.  If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll 
        have to hide it from him the same way your mother and I 
        have hidden it from your fathers.  You don&#39;t need to reveal 
        it, since many of the techniques can be used without your 
        partner&#39;s knowledge.  Some people are natural lovers,&quot;  
        [smiling]  &quot;and your fathers are in this category.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Auntie, I didn&#39;t ask when we were training, but...&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;You want to know about the night I spent with your 
        father after the funeral, don&#39;t you?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Mother wrote that I&#39;d understand one day.&quot;

Nabiki, Akane, Ranko, and Ranma are stunned at the news.  Nodoka 
closed her eyes to think.

Nodoka:  &quot;Your mother and I were once lovers.  Does this shock 
        you?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;It shouldn&#39;t, but..&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;We were supposed to be enemies, but our duel was more 
        than just that.  We could both feel it from the kiss.  We 
        loved each other so much.  Just before she died, your 
        mother asked me to train you, and she also asked that if 
        your father was overly incapacitated by grief to help him 
        out of it.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;She said she asked you to do it.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Your father was in a terrible state.  He could barely keep 
        himself together.  Dearest hadn&#39;t arrived yet, so I knew I 
        didn&#39;t have much time.  With the help of some 
        hallucinogenic incense, and with your mother&#39;s coaching, I 
        made love to him as your mother, and told him to let go of 
        the grief.  And the next day he started to recover himself.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;But did you have to sleep with him?&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Your mother asked me to.  And because I loved her, I did.  
        The loving was necessary to convince him that it wasn&#39;t just 
        some dream that he could ignore; that it was a vision sent 
        to guide him.  In some ways it is not unlike Akane refusing 
        to pledge herself exclusively to Ranma so that you, and 
        Nabiki, and Ranko could have a man to train with.&quot;

***************

Kodachi crept along the top of the Tendo&#39;s roof, determined to find 
the room of &quot;Ranko Saotome&quot;.  Her plan was simple:  To look into 
each room until she found the one she wanted, then lie in wait until 
she was unprepared, and then attack.  Kodachi reasoned that this 
Ranko must be the same person as her brother&#39;s red-haired &quot;pig-
tailed goddess&quot; that he was always going on about, as well as Akane 
Tendo.  The night concealed her movements effectively (even 
though the moon was starting to rise) and she peeked into the first 
window, using her sound amplification equipment to hear what was 
going on inside.

Akane entered the room followed by Ranma.

Kodachi watched wide-eyed as the two lovers slipped the robes off 
each others bodies.  They turned off the lights and Kodachi could 
only somewhat make out the movements of the darkened forms, but 
she could hear everything they said.  The girl was Akane Tendo, 
that her brother had gone on about for the past year or so.  The boy 
was Ranma Saotome, the one who kept defeating him in battle.

Ranma led Akane to the mattress and poised himself at her 
entrance.  Kodachi could see the outline of his manhood jutting from 
his body, the first she had ever seen.  She considered it a 
magnificent beast, and licked her lips in fascination as he slipped 
easily into Akane&#39;s body.

Through the earphones she could hear every sound issued by the two 
lovers, and as the moon rose higher in the sky she gained a better 
view of the room.  She heard Akane implore, then threaten, then 
start to be driven insane at Ranma&#39;s refusal to bring her to orgasm.  
Kodachi watched Ranma repeatedly bring Akane to the edge, then 
slowing, or withdrawing, before she could fall.

Kodachi could not tear her eyes from the erotic scene in front of her.  
Ranma started to drive himself furiously into Akane.  Each 
downward stroke was met by Akane&#39;s hips and the sound of their 
impacts echoed in the room.  Akane screamed in ecstasy as her 
orgasm overtook her body, the sound being muffled by Ranma&#39;s kiss.

Ranma fell onto Akane&#39;s body, his manhood erect and buried within 
her.  Outside, Kodachi strained to hear their conversation.  Ranma 
slowly moved his cock within Akane&#39;s pussy.

Ranma:  &quot;Its almost 11:30.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;You had me going for nearly two hours?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Mom said I had to work on control.&quot;

Akane kissed Ranma and they shifted position so that Akane rose 
above his prone body, grinding their hips together.

Akane:  &quot;You&#39;re not the only one that&#39;s worked on stamina.  But 
        cum in me.  I want your seed in me.&quot; 

Ranma sat up so that his mouth was next to Akane&#39;s ear.  His hands 
ran down her slick back, bringing their bodies close, never breaking 
their lower connection.

Ranma:  &quot;No promises.  I want you to cum again and again...&quot;

Kodachi watched as Ranma brought Akane to climax in a dozen 
different positions.  If she had been able to notice she would have 
found her leotard soaked with her own juices.  After another two 
hours Ranma released his juices into Akane and the two fell 
exhausted onto the futon.

Kodachi left for her home, determined to get Ranma for herself.  
She relieved herself with the leather-bound handle of her special 
ribbon until she was exhausted.  Her brother remained fast asleep in 
his room.

Marital Arts 3 - The Gymnastics Match
Part 2

Ranma:  [breathing heavily]  &quot;I don&#39;t think I could do that again for 
        another month.&quot;
Akane:  [breathing heavily]  &quot;Good.  I like it better the normal way.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t make it last the whole night.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous.  Once or twice or three times a night is 
        enough for me.&quot;  [kisses Ranma]  &quot;Do you think we could 
        do it again tomorrow?&quot;

Akane pulled Ranma over so that he lay on top of her, his breath 
falling on her nipple.

Ranma:  &quot;Just let me rest a little while.  And I&#39;d make love to you 
        every night if you want.&quot;

Akane ran her hand though Ranma&#39;s hair as they fell asleep.

***************

Ranko woke Ranma up with a bucketful of water.

Ranko:  &quot;Pop wants to practice this morning.  He seems pretty 
        tired.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;So am I.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Well, that&#39;s your fault.&quot;

Ranko kissed Ranma.

Ranma:  &quot;What was that for?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;For asking about me yesterday.&quot;

Ranko kissed Akane.

Akane:  &quot;What was that for?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;For making him ask about me.  Yuck!&quot;  [lifting the 
        blanket]  &quot;What a mess.  I wish I could have made some of 
        it.&quot;

Ranma and Akane blush.

Ranko:  &quot;Lets go take a bath.  Kasumi and Nabiki are already 
        waiting for us.&quot;

***************

Nabiki:  &quot;Here come the two lovebirds.&quot;

Akane, Ranko, and Ranma wash themselves down and step into the 
bath.

Akane:  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Nabiki.  Did we disturb you last night?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;No, I spent it with Kasumi and Ranko.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Akane, did you want to join me and Dr. Tofu one day 
        next week?  I&#39;m already going to arrange for Nabiki&#39;s and 
        Ranko&#39;s &#39;examination&#39;.&quot;

Akane caught Ranma looking at her.

Akane:  &quot;You don&#39;t mind, do you, Ranma?&quot;

Ranma wanted to tell her &quot;yes&quot;, to forbid her from seeing him again.  
But then he thought about making love to their sisters.

Ranma:  &quot;If you want to...&quot;

Ranma went flying toward the bathroom door, impacting it upside 
down.  His head hit the floor.

Ranko:  &quot;What a way to treat your husband.&quot;

Ranko impacted Ranma&#39;s body and the two of them fell to the floor.

Ranko:  &quot;What a tomboy.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Tell me about it.&quot;

***************

The twins&#39; practice finished quickly as Ranko was able to easily 
defeat Ranma and Genma due to their exhaustion.  Soun cried at 
breakfast when he noticed that Akane was mad at Ranma.  By mid-
afternoon Ranma and Akane had made up.

Everyone sat at the dinner table.

Nabiki:  &quot;So, Ranko.  Are you really fighting Kodachi Kuno?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Not me...  Kuno?  I should have guessed.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Then it must have been you, Ranma.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;How do you know about it?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;I have my sources.  She usually attacks her opponents 
        before the match.  Not one has remained to actually fight 
        her.  So are you going to?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I don&#39;t think so.  Why even have a school team if they 
        can&#39;t fight their own battles?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Too bad.  With the current odds, I could have made a 
        killing just by betting that the match would take place.&quot;

***************

Kodachi bounced into the Furinkan High courtyard dressed in her 
school uniform.  She immediately latched onto Ranma&#39;s leg.

Kodachi:  &quot;My husband, my master, why do you stray with this 
        strumpet, this hussy?  I am your faithful slave.  Your every 
        wish is my command!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;What?  Let go!&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Get off of him!&quot;

Akane kicked Kodachi off of Ranma.  She flipped in midair and 
landed upright next to Kuno.

Kodachi:  &quot;Brother, dear.  Help me regain my husband.&quot;
Kuno:  &quot;You bigamist!  So that&#39;s why my sister was gone all 
        Saturday night!  Prepare to feel the righteous wrath of 
        heaven!&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;He has run away from me after we spent all night 
        making love.  Taking me and taking me until I could stand 
        it no longer.  And now he has run to this whore!&quot;

Everyone was shocked, except for Akane, who was extremely angry.

Ranma:  &quot;I was with my wife, Akane, all Saturday night and every 
        night!  I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;
Kuno:  &quot;A likely story.  I, Tatewaki Kuno, shall destroy your 
        lecherous ways.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Ranma is my husband.  I&#39;ll show you.&quot;

Akane kissed Ranma.  Kodachi and Kuno gasped and leaped to 
attack.  At the last second, Ranma spun Akane around, lifting her 
body in the air to kick both attackers and knock them unconscious.  
Still kissing, they returned to their original positions, where Akane 
was immediately swept away by her classmates to talk about 
Ranma&#39;s performance &quot;all Saturday night&quot;.

Ranko thought to herself &quot;Those two are identical.  What a twisted 
family.&quot;.  She suddenly saw a small black pig wearing a yellow cloth 
collar walk into the courtyard.  She picked it up and carried it into 
the classroom with her.

Later that day, Akane joined the Rhythmic Gymnastics team.

***************

Ranma watched Akane lay out the rhythmic gymnastics tools on the 
Dojo floor.

Ranma:  &quot;I can&#39;t believe that you signed up for this.  Do you even 
        know how these things work?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Just watch me.&quot;

Akane proceeded to break the hoop and entangle herself in the 
ribbon.  Ranko pulled Ryoga into the Dojo.

Ranko:  &quot;Ryoga says he could train you.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;This is so generous of you, Ryoga.&quot;
Ryoga:  [blushing]  &quot;You... you think so?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Hey!  Fine!  Do what you like!&quot;

Ranma stomped off as Akane stared after him, realizing that he was 
jealous.  Ranko stopped him just before he left the Dojo.

Ranko:  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.  I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot;

Ranma went to sit on the Dojo steps.  Ranko went up to Ryoga and 
stuck her hand down his pants, grabbing his manhood.

Ranko:  &quot;Don&#39;t even think about coming between them.&quot;

Ryoga passed out.  Once he recovered, he started to train Akane.

***************

Ranko nervously brought Ryoga in front of her parents.
 
Ranko:  &quot;This is Ryoga.&quot;
Genma:  &quot;And what are your intentions toward my daughter?&quot;
Ryoga:  [gulping]  &quot;Purely honorable, sir.&quot;
Genma:  &quot;Come with me, boy.  I have to see if you are a worthy 
        prospect.&quot;
 
Genma led Ryoga out of the room and promptly hit him in the head.  
Ryoga stood shocked until Ranko urged him to fight back.  After a 
short time, the two came back and Nodoka shooed Ranko and 
Genma from the room.

Nodoka:  &quot;Do you love my daughter, Ryoga?&quot;
Ryoga:  &quot;Umm... well...&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;I can tell by your reaction that you do, even if you cannot 
        bring yourself to admit it.  We are a family of martial 
        artists, and you are a martial artist, so do you understand 
        what it means to be involved with us?&quot;
Ryoga:  &quot;I do.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Do you?  I will not interfere with my daughter&#39;s life.  It is 
        her decision who to love, and even when to make love.  I 
        love her, but I do not own her.  Are you willing to make the 
        same choice?&quot;
Ryoga:  &quot;I... I...&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;It is not a decision you have to make immediately.  But 
        there is something that you should know.  Do you see the 
        katana?&quot;  [Ryoga nods]  &quot;It is mine.  Not my husband&#39;s, but 
        mine.  And I will use it if I have to.  Do you understand?&quot;

Ryoga nodded as he found himself unable to speak.  Nodoka showed 
him to the door where Ranko waited for them.

***************

Kasumi hummed happily to herself at the dinner table.

Soun:  &quot;Another date with Dr. Tofu, Kasumi?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;He&#39;s so sweet.  I think he&#39;s already prepared to ask me to 
        marry him.  Of course I can&#39;t accept.&quot;
Soun:  &quot;Why not?&quot;

Soun looked crestfallen, his celebration fans suddenly floating in the 
stew.

Kasumi:  &quot;Its too soon!  What will people say?&quot;
Soun:  &quot;They will say that you are being a good and dutiful 
        daughter.  If he proposes, you must accept.&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;I will not!&quot;

Soun fainted at the outburst from his daughter.  He bounced back 
up.

Soun:  &quot;You will!&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;I won&#39;t!  And if you try to make me... I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll run away 
        and live with him!&quot;
Soun:  &quot;The dishonor!  The disobedience!&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Calm down, Soun.  You have to accept that your 
        daughters are growing up and have lives of their own.  You 
        have to let go.&quot;

Soun was immediately reminded of the night after his wife&#39;s funeral.  
She had come to him that night, in a dream, and used those exact 
same words.

Soun:  &quot;Oh, mother!  What should I do?  Our children are growing 
        up!&quot;

Soun jumped up to pray at the family alter.  After a while, he took 
Kasumi&#39;s hand.

Soun:  &quot;Kasumi, I won&#39;t tell you to accept Dr. Tofu&#39;s proposal.   But 
        if he should ask, will you promise to consider it for a few 
        days?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Of course, father.&quot;

***************

Kodachi writhed under the attentions of her teammate, who had 
strapped on a dildo and was driving it into Kodachi&#39;s body as she lay 
in the center of the ring, the spotlights hot on their bodies.  There 
were those that expressed concern that Kodachi would wear herself 
out before the match, as they had done this every night during the 
week, but they were suitably punished for their impertinence.

Kodachi would repeatedly moan and call out Ranma&#39;s name as she 
came.  Every so often the teammate attending her would tire and 
another would take her place.  Eventually the time limit Kodachi 
had set for them had expired and they left her alone in the 
gymnasium to go home; it was the same amount of time that Ranma 
had been with Akane the night she spied on them.  She had realized 
that he was not her husband, but that did not deter her from vowing 
to make him hers.

Her teammates left talking about the &quot;Ranma&quot; that she had 
screamed out, and how he was the husband of her upcoming 
opponent.  Kodachi jumped up and started to use her ribbon on them 
for daring to talk in such a manner in her presence.  The gymnastics 
team knelt down and accepted the punishment as always.  After she 
felt that she had whipped them enough, she let them leave.  Some of 
the gymnasts were excited by the treatment and ran home to relieve 
themselves, as they were used to the happenings of the gymnastics 
team, and welcomed it.

Kodachi returned to lying in the center of the ring, letting the 
gymnasium lights dry the sweat and cum from her body.

Kodachi:  &quot;Oh, my Lord Ranma.  You shall be mine once again.&quot;

***************

Akane injured herself the night before the match, and Ranko was 
persuaded to take her place.  Ryoga had a difficult time teaching 
Ranko, so Ranma fought with her.  Both were quite good as a result 
from watching Akane practice during the week. 

***************

Kodachi and her second-in-command made a last-minute equipment 
check for the next day&#39;s match.  It would be her first real match in 
almost a year.  The house was quiet; her parents were off on another 
long trip and her brother was already sleeping.  Kodachi smiled at 
she looked around the private practice room.

Kodachi:  &quot;Atsui...&quot;
Atsui:  &quot;Yes, Mistress.&quot;

Her second-in-command knew what was coming; they had done this 
every night before a planned match since they started junior high 
together.  She kept a straight face and looked down at Kodachi&#39;s 
feet.

Kodachi:  &quot;Atsui, do you love me?&quot;
Atsui:  &quot;With all my soul, Mistress.&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;Then use this last instrument on me.  Bring me 
        fulfillment and happiness.&quot;
Atsui:  &quot;As you desire, Mistress.&quot;

Kodachi held up the strap-on dildo they had used countless times 
before.  It was double-headed and designed to pleasure both of them 
at the same time.  Atsui quickly stripped her clothes from her body 
and stepped into the straps, inserting her end into herself, then 
tightening it until it fit snugly on her body.  Atsui removed the 
clothes from Kodachi, noting that the crotch was already soaked.

Atsui:  &quot;Does Mistress Kodachi wish me to pleasure her orally?&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;No, take me the way my Lord takes all his women.  
        Without the need for such trivialities.&quot;

Kodachi laid on the cold wooden floor, raising pimples all over her 
body and causing her nipples to protrude even further from her 
breasts.  Atsui knelt and positioned the head of the dildo at 
Kodachi&#39;s entrance.  Kodachi&#39;s lips glistened with her juices and 
Atsui&#39;s easily slipped the dildo into her.  Their breasts were 
squashed between them as Atsui bounced their hips together.  
Instead of her second-in-command, Kodachi found herself looking 
at the image of Ranma.  The thought alone brought her to an 
incredible climax.  Atsui continued to fuck Kodachi and herself, 
wondering at the effect that this &quot;Ranma&quot; had on her lover.  Their 
juices started to run down their legs onto the floor as they continued 
their lovemaking.

Atsui found herself moaning out Kodachi&#39;s name as she climaxed, 
just as she had always done.  Kodachi repeatedly called out Ranma&#39;s 
name, commanding Atsui to continue.  Atsui shuddered at what 
Ranma must be capable of, if the week&#39;s practice sessions or the 
effect he had on Kodachi were any indication.  Still, she strove to 
recover and fulfill her lover&#39;s desires.

Kuno slept fitfully, but awoke at the sound of his rival&#39;s name 
echoing through the house.  He angrily awoke; he had dreamt that 
both Ranko Saotome and Akane Tendo had abandoned Ranma and 
moved in with him, pleasuring him endlessly.  He even had a hard-
on as he jumped from his bed.

Kuno:  &quot;Saotome!  Do you torment even my dreams?&quot;

He tracked down the source of the sounds.  They were coming from 
the practice room.  He threw open the door and barged in, but was 
stunned at the sight that greeted him.  His sister was having sex with 
another girl!  His blood started to boil and he lost consciousness.

Kodachi and Atsui finished their latest orgasm.  Kodachi looked at 
the unconscious heap at the door.

Kodachi:  &quot;Atsui, are you mine?&quot;
Atsui:  &quot;Forever, Mistress.&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;Willing to do anything for me?&quot;
Atsui:  &quot;Anything.  Request and it is yours.&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;Take my brother in your ass.&quot;
Atsui:  &quot;Oh no, Mistress.  I am yours.  Do anything to me that you 
        wish.&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;Be quiet, slave!&quot;

Kodachi slapped Atsui, slipping off the dildo that connected them.  
She commanded Atsui to remain in her current position, and 
undressed and placed her unconscious brother so that he lay across 
her back.  Kodachi quickly ran to the bathroom and returned with a 
jar of petroleum jelly, smearing it over both her brother&#39;s cock and 
the dildo.  Kodachi resumed her place and guided the dildo to her 
asshole, shivering as it slowly entered her.  Atsui slowly moved her 
hips.  The movement woke Kuno.

Kuno:  &quot;What?&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;Come, brother.  Take this girl&#39;s ass just as she is taking 
        mine.&quot;
Kuno:  &quot;I am not part of your twisted actions, sister.&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;Suit yourself.  You can go back to your bed unfulfilled 
        and leave this poor girl unfulfilled.  She wants you, don&#39;t 
        you, slave?&quot;
Atsui:  &quot;Yes, Mistress.&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;Beg for it.&quot;
Atsui:  &quot;Please take me, Master.  Take me in my virgin ass.  I need 
        it to fulfill myself.&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;See, brother?  How can you deny such a request?&quot;

Kuno started to turn away, unable to comply.  He looked at his 
manhood as it betrayed his excitement.  With a roar, he gave in and 
grasped Atsui&#39;s ass with his hands, impaling her with her manhood.  
The movement was awkward at first as they strove to set up some 
sort of rhythm, but quickly became more regular.  Kodachi plunged 
three fingers into herself as everyone quickly approached orgasm, 
both girls luxuriated in the feeling of having both entrances filled.

Kuno grunted and shot his seed into Atsui&#39;s ass, sending the girl 
reeling into her orgasm at the feeling of his hot seed.  Atsui 
desperately plunged the dildo deep into Kodachi and managed to 
feel a satisfying shiver as they collapsed into a heap.  Kuno 
immediately fell asleep.  Kodachi and Atsui disentangled themselves 
and made their way to the shower.

Kodachi:  &quot;Did you enjoy that, Atsui?&quot;
Atsui:  &quot;Yes, Mistress.  Thank you for the honor of allowing me 
        such an opportunity.&quot;
Kodachi:  &quot;Do you wish to stay the night?&quot;
Atsui:  &quot;Only if it pleases you, my Lady.&quot;

Atsui called her parents to tell them that she was staying the night, 
and followed Kodachi to her bed, where they snuggled in their 
familiar way.  Kuno remained asleep on the practice room floor for 
the rest of the night.

***************

Marital Arts 3 - The Gymnastics Match
Part 3

The gymnasium was packed with students from both schools.  
Kodachi entered first, stepping into the ring covered by a trench 
coat.  As she was introduced by the referee she whipped her coat off; 
the crowd gasped as she revealed her outfit, the leather black and 
glossy, and tooled with the emblem of a rose.  She stepped forward 
to the cheers of her classmates.

Ranko:  &quot;Feh.  What a showoff.&quot;

Ranko calmly walked up to the ring and was introduced to the 
crowd.  The fight began as Kodachi revealed her secret weapons, 
clubs with spikes, hoops with razor edges, and her special &quot;ribbon of 
nine tails&quot;.  Each time Akane objected, but was overruled by the 
referee.  Objects from the crowd were grabbed with the ribbons and 
thrown at each other; tables, and chairs, and even a panda that 
caught Kodachi&#39;s attention.  All were ruled legal by the judges.  
Ranko was able to spin Kodachi out of the ring using Kodachi&#39;s 
baton as she attacked, but Kodachi whistled and the ring moved, 
enabling her to land within its confines.  Ranko whistled and the 
ring moved back to its original position.

Kodachi started to gloat as she trapped her opponent within her 
ribbons.  Ranko picked up the discarded razor hoop and cut the 
ribbons.  Ranko got an idea and ripped one of the corner posts from 
its housing.  It sprung toward its opposite and Ranko rode it through 
the air as the tension of the ropes caused it to fly straight at Kodachi.  
Kodachi started to jump to the safety of the opposite corner post, but 
Ranko grabbed her own discarded ribbon as she passed over the 
floor, whipped the end around Kodachi&#39;s ankle, and pulled her back 
onto the floor.

The post hit Kodachi and knocked her onto the floor.  Before the 
post hit its opposite Ranko jumped to one of the other posts, landing 
safely on it.  The judges quickly conferred.

Kodachi was found to be outside of the ring; the ring being defined 
by the four posts and the ropes.  The referee declared Ranko the 
winner.  Kodachi cried as she realized that she would have to give 
up on Ranma as she had promised if she had lost the match, but 
then realized that she could start her passions anew.

She would have to become even more worthy of his love.

***************

The Tendo Dojo was awash with excitement over Ranko&#39;s victory.  
The victory would speak of the quality of the Dojo&#39;s students, and it 
was expected that more people would sign-up for the Dojo&#39;s classes.  
There was a small party being held downstairs.  Ranko left early, 
saying that she was tired and wished to rest.  Nodoka raised an 
eyebrow and Ranko blushed, knowing that she couldn&#39;t fool her 
mother.

Outside, Ranma and Akane led a blindfolded Ryoga to a spot below 
Ranko&#39;s window.

Ranma:  &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Come on, you promised your sister.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I know, but still...&quot;

Ranko opened the window and Ranma lifted Ryoga to a point to 
where he could climb into it.  Ryoga was blushing all the while.  
Ranma and Akane left to join the party.

***************

Kodachi wandered the halls of her house, desolate at her loss.  She 
spotted her brother arranging some of the family&#18;s rose plants.  He 
had refused to come to her match, saying he was distraught that he 
had committed such a vile act as anal sex, and that he had no self-
control, that he had betrayed his true loves, Akane Tendo and Ranko 
Saotome.

She took her special ribbon and wrapped the end around Kuno, 
entangling him.  As she dragged him to her room she gagged him, 
and flung him onto her bed, handcuffing his wrists to the bedposts.

Kodachi:  &quot;Come, slave.  I will teach you how to eat pussy.&quot;
Kuno:  [muffled]  &quot;What are you doing, sister?&quot;
Kodachi:  [hitting him]  &quot;That&#39;s Mistress Kodachi!&quot;

Kodachi slipped out of her leather outfit and descended on her 
brother&#39;s face.  The prospect of committing incest excited her and 
she regretted not taking him the night before.  She was already wet 
when she first felt her brother&#39;s mouth on her sex.  As she 
approached her first orgasm she started to call out Ranma&#39;s name 
again.  Kuno couldn&#39;t hear her as her thighs pressed in on his ears 
and blocked out all sound, and all he knew was that he had once 
again fallen to the weakness of lust.

***************

Ranko dragged Ryoga into her room and kissed him, shutting the 
window behind him.  Before he could react, she touched his Shiatsu 
Erection Spot, reasoning that she could keep him from losing 
consciousness if she could direct the blood somewhere else.  It 
worked.

Ranko removed the bandanna from Ryoga&#39;s eyes as she worked his 
cock with her hand, keeping it erect.  Still, Ryoga almost fainted at 
the sight of Ranko clad in only her panties.  Ranko was glad he 
didn&#39;t.  Ryoga spluttered; he hadn&#39;t realized what Ranko had 
planned for the night, he had expected only maybe holding each 
others hand, or maybe even kissing.  Ranko kissed him again and 
brought one of his hands up to her breast.

Ranko taught him to gently caress it and she enjoyed his actions for 
awhile, but then grew hungry for more.  She sat Ryoga on the side of 
her bed and knelt between his legs, loosening his pants and slipping 
it and his underwear off.  She had Ryoga take his shirt off as she 
kissed the tip of his manhood.  Ryoga shivered as she slid her lips 
down until they rested around the head of his penis, drawing her 
tongue across the sensitive skin.

He looked down at her and she looked up, smiling at him.  Ryoga 
placed his hands on the back of her head as she attacked his cock 
with renewed vigor, soaking it with her saliva.  She started to pump 
his manhood with her hand, saving the top for her mouth.  Ryoga 
started to feel himself rapidly approach orgasm, feeling ashamed 
that he could not last longer.

Ranko felt him approach orgasm, recognizing the same signs from 
her experiences with her brother.  She started to pump him harder 
and faster, and heard him grunt as he started to ejaculate into her 
mouth.  Ranko swallowed every drop as she felt his hands attempt to 
drive her head into his crotch. 

Ryoga fell backwards on the bed, a little stunned and drained.  
Ranko scooted up to kiss him, then pulled his head to her breast, 
imploring him to lick it.  Again and again Ranko would tell Ryoga 
how to attend to her body; Ryoga found himself eagerly obeying 
every request.  Ranko came as Ryoga finger-fucked her; she 
spasmed around his penetrating fingers and her juices ran down his 
hand.

Ranko had to tell Ryoga what had just happened, complimenting 
him on his ability to give her pleasure.  Ryoga swelled with pride.  
Ranko looked at him hungrily and the pride was momentarily 
replaced by fear.

Ranko licked her lips.  Since Ryoga showed up again she had not 
been with anyone else, not wanting to take the chance that Ryoga 
would find out and be disgusted and leave her.  She knew that 
Ranma and Akane were doing it almost nightly, and that Nabiki and 
Kasumi sometimes joined them.  She missed the feeling of someone 
else&#39;s touch on her.

Ranko straddled his torso and slowly lowered herself onto him.  She 
had done this many times with Ranma, but for Ryoga it was a first.  
He looked at Ranko, and her face was flushed, her body glistening 
with a layer of sweat and her nipples stood out from enlarged 
areolae.  She grabbed his hands and brought them back to her 
breasts.  As he worked them she started to move above him.

He watched her sway above him, her back arched and eyes closed, 
savoring each moment of their joining.  Her hands ran down his 
arms as she continued to grind their hips together.  Ryoga felt 
Ranko&#39;s body surround his cock, sliding over it slowly at first but 
with increasing speed.  It almost felt as if she were hugging him 
through their sexes.  Ryoga was rapidly approaching his orgasm; he 
hoped that he would be able to last long enough for Ranko to join 
him.  He didn&#39;t know if it was a myth that the guys talked about to 
try to impress each other, but Ranko acted as if she believed in it, 
and she was the one moaning at the pleasure that he was giving her.

Ryoga started to buck his hips as he got closer, but Ranko was not 
quite there.  She knew what was going to happen.  Ranko lunged 
down so that he fully penetrated her.  Ranko squeezed the muscles 
in her pussy around his cock, continuing her motion but not lifting 
herself off him.

Ryoga grunted as he started to cum, except that he didn&#39;t.  Ranko 
continued to build herself up to her own orgasm, and when she 
reached it she stopped performing her maneuver.  With a sudden 
flood her pussy was filled with both of their juices as Ryoga sent 
pulse after pulse of his seed deep within her.

Ranko lifted herself off of Ryoga&#39;s softening manhood and lay down 
on his chest.  Ryoga tiredly put his arm around her back and pulled 
the blanket over them.  

Ranko:  &quot;You were incredible.&quot;
Ryoga:  &quot;I... I thought I was going to disappoint you.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;But you didn&#39;t.&quot;
Ryoga:  &quot;I love you.&quot;

Ranko responded by kissing him.  There didn&#39;t seem to be much else 
to say, so they lay quietly together.  Ryoga felt Ranko&#39;s nipples press 
into his chest, felt her sex rub along his leg, and smelt the fragrance 
of her hair.  Ranko moved a little so that his hand touched her 
breast.  He cupped it gently and closed his eyes.

Within minutes he was asleep.  Ranko hugged him as she savored 
the warmth their two bodies generated.  She knew that one day she 
would have to tell him about Shampoo.  She also knew that one day 
she would have to decide if she wanted to bring him into the &quot;family 
secret&quot;, whether or not she wanted to risk killing him.  But those 
days could wait.

She checked to make sure that she had some cold water in the room, 
so that she could change him into his cursed form so that her father 
wouldn&#39;t find out the next morning.  She told herself that she would 
wake up sometime in the middle of the night to repeat their 
performance.  She would teach Ryoga how to best to please her, and 
she would learn how best to please him.  That&#39;s what love was all 
about, right?

She closed her eyes, hoping that everything would work out for her 
the same way it seemed it was for Ranma.  She slipped the arm that 
she had placed across his chest down to his manhood and gently 
grasped it, finding it still damp with their mixed juices.  She hoped 
that one day she could share him with the others, to give back some 
of the pleasure she had received.

As she fell asleep her last thought was that Ryoga was still wearing 
that stupid yellow bandanna.
