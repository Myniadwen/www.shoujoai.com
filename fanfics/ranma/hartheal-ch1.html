<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/roeder.html">D.F. Roeder</a><br> </h2>
<pre>     ----- Continuity -----
This is a Ranma divergence fic, the divergence occurring at the 
beginning of the Ranma storyline, the day before the fateful trip 
to Jusenkyo at the end of the 10-year training trip. This will 
NOT be a rehash of the &quot;Sorry &#39;bout this!&quot; beginning to Ranma 
1/2. It will be decidedly different, as you will see.

This is also a continuation of the TM! OAV storyline, although 
the concentration will be on one character, with the remaining 
cast coming in as appropriate.

The dates inserted are somewhat arbitrary. If anyone has better 
info and can point to some primary source material to back it up, 
I would then welcome suggestions.

     ----- Acknowledgments -----
My sincere thanks to Vince Seifert for giving this puppy a 
critical going over. As always, my work would be far poorer 
without him.

Thanks to T.H. Tiger for the Tenchi discussions, catching some 
errors of omission, and the thumbs up. ^_^

[October 7, 1991]

&quot;Excuse me, sir.&quot;

The okonomiyaki vendor looked up from the grill to see a short, 
ragtag redheaded girl wearing Chinese peasant clothes looking up 
at him.

&quot;What do *you* want,&quot; he asked suspiciously.

&quot;Lookin&#39; for work.&quot;

&lt;A classic case,&gt; the vendor thought, his eyes narrowing. &lt;Barely 
keepin&#39; the drool in her mouth.&gt; &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Ranma.&quot;

&quot;What Ranma?&quot;

Ranma lowered her gaze to the grill, shuffled her feet, and 
didn&#39;t answer.

&quot;Where&#39;s your family?&quot;

Her eyes flicked from side to side. &quot;Ain&#39;t got none.&quot;

&lt;Oh, great.&gt; &quot;Gomen. Don&#39;t have any work for ronin.&quot;

Ranma sighed, &quot;Nobody does,&quot; and started to walk off.

A mild attack of conscience loosened the vendor&#39;s tongue. &quot;Wait a 
sec.&quot;

Ranma turned and watched the man wrap a plain okonomiyaki in 
newspaper. &quot;Here. Now be off with ya!&quot;

Ranma took the proffered food. &quot;Arigatou gozai--&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah. Just scoot!&quot;

To the vendor&#39;s relief, Ranma sketched a bow and left.


Slowly munching on the okonomiyaki to savor every bite, Ranma 
wandered down the street, occasionally asking the locals for 
work. No luck, and night was beginning to fall.

She popped the last piece of the dough into her mouth and chewed. 
&lt;Sure ain&#39;t yours, Ucchan, old buddy. I could really go for one 
of your pop&#39;s famous cakes.&gt; She slumped a little. &lt;Your folks 
wouldn&#39;t want me now, either, I guess.&gt;

&quot;Shit!&quot; &lt;What&#39;s in a name, anyways? Just one more way ta pin ya 
down, make ya somethin&#39; ya ain&#39;t, or... try ta make ya be 
somethin&#39; ya can&#39;t be no more, because ya spent your life 
followin&#39; some dumb-ass fa--&gt;

An explosive sneeze shattered her thoughts. &quot;Oooh, that felt 
weird.&quot; She looked at the slightly green-tinged mucus on her 
hand. &quot;*Now* what?&quot; Ranma wiped her hand on her sleeve and walked 
on.

----------

[June 14, 1976]

The door opened to reveal three women in their best kimonos.

&quot;Nodoka-san! How are you? Is that Ranma-chan?&quot; The first guest 
wiggled her fingers at the one-year old child Saotome Nodoka 
cradled in her arms.

The three women filed in, and Nodoka bade them sit while she 
prepared some tea. She handed Ranma off to one of the ladies to 
play with. She smiled at the joy a little baby could bring and 
went into the kitchen.


&quot;So what&#39;s that husband of yours up to, these days?&quot; guest number 
three asked.

A small frown creased Nodoka&#39;s forehead as she sipped her tea. 
&quot;He&#39;s probably off running around with that friend of his, Tendou 
Soun.&quot;

&quot;Errr, has he gotten a job--&quot; guest number two asked before 
getting swatted by guest number one. A quick glare from number 
one sent number two in a different direction. &quot;I mean, has he 
gotten to know his baby?&quot; Number two smiled weakly.

It was a lame save, and Nodoka knew it. She shook her head 
wearily. &quot;No and not really,&quot; she replied, answering both 
questions. Ranma began to complain at that moment, and Nodoka 
took him back from the woman who&#39;d been holding him. Picking up a 
bottle she&#39;d prepared earlier, she began to feed him. She smiled 
serenely down at her child. &quot;Your Mommy&#39;s little manly man, 
aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Ranma just looked up at his mother, soaking in the sounds of her 
voice as he suckled on the plastic nipple. Understanding would 
come later.

----------

[October 9, 1991]

Something was definitely wrong. Ranma coughed, her chest rattling 
and wheezing. &lt;Man, I *never* get sick! What the hell&#39;s this all 
about?!&gt;

Finding no comfort in her thoughts, Ranma continued down another 
street. She&#39;d finally made it to Tokyo and was wandering around 
the Juuban district, still looking for work. Being sick, as well 
as without family, made her all too easy to turn down. Starving 
and gaunt, Ranma kept trudging.

&lt;What I wouldn&#39;t give ta see Pops about now,&gt; she mused, then her 
face darkened. &quot;No, he had his chance,&quot; she mumbled.

Her sunken and hooded eyes concentrated on the asphalt in front 
of her as she continued in a straight line, not caring where.

&quot;Baka oyaji...&quot;

----------

[March 15, 1990]

*WHAP!* Saotome Genma cuffed the back of his son&#39;s head. &quot;Boy, 
I&#39;m really starting to worry about your training! Thievery is 
part and parcel of the Musabetsu Kakutou Ryuu! What will it take 
to get through to you?!&quot;

The son, Saotome Ranma, was getting a belly full of his father&#39;s 
griping this morning and had just about had enough. &quot;Pops, how&#39;s 
it gonna help me in the Art, again? What the HELL does thievin&#39; 
have to do with martial arts?! Just cause YOU couldn&#39;t steal 
enough this mornin&#39; ta fill your fat belly&#39;s no reason ta get mad 
at me!&quot;

Genma put his fists up to his head and reared back. &quot;ARGH!! 
Stupid boy! It&#39;s not the stealing, it&#39;s the situations it puts 
you in!! Have you learned nothing?!&quot;

Cross, Ranma snorted and looked away. &quot;You&#39;ve been tryin&#39; ta sell 
me that bill&#39;o goods for ten years. Give it up.&quot;

Genma slumped, still angry but unable to come up with further 
argument. He shouldered his pack and struck off down the road. 
Thinking of his good friend, Tendou Soun, he mumbled quietly to 
himself, but not quietly enough. &quot;The boy&#39;s going to be a big 
disappointment when we get home.&quot;

&lt;NANI?!?!&gt; Ranma was thunderstruck - this was something 
completely new. &lt;What&#39;s Pops talkin&#39; about?! Who&#39;ll be 
disappointed at home?!&gt; The realization that hit was terrible. 
Who else? &lt;MOTHER?!?!?!&gt;

Visibly shaking, Ranma hefted his pack and plodded after his 
father. His thoughts were having a hard time coalescing into 
anything understandable, so he just followed along, allowing the 
turmoil to settle into a dull ache.


&quot;See that cooked duck hanging over there, boy?&quot; Evening had 
fallen, and Genma and Ranma had made it to a small village, a 
half-day&#39;s walk from their next training stop. Genma, of course, 
had blown what little money they still had left on Chinese beer 
the night before.

&quot;Yeah, so what.&quot; Ranma studied his fingernails.

Genma grimaced and leaned one hand against the building they were 
hiding behind. &quot;So *take* it, boy!&quot;

&quot;Ain&#39;t gonna.&quot; Ranma started to walk off, but Genma cuffed him on 
the head again, glaring.

&quot;You&#39;re such a disappointment, Ranma.&quot;

Ranma flinched, thinking of his mother again.

&quot;Why, when I was training, we would...&quot;

Tuning his father out, Ranma concentrated on stuffing away the 
hurt, but he was unsuccessful. It quickly boiled into anger, 
simmering just below the surface. &lt;No way! She can&#39;t want me to 
be like *him*!&gt; Ranma&#39;s thoughts roiled, and he missed the rest 
of Genma&#39;s anecdote.

&quot;So, now do you see?&quot; Genma finished.

Staring at the ground with his fists clenched, Ranma barely heard 
his father&#39;s question. He looked up.

&quot;Huh?&quot;

Defeated, Genma slumped and then prepared himself for a try at 
the duck hanging so tantalizing close yet so annoyingly far. 
Genma grumbled to himself as he moved off, &quot;What a disappointment 
he&#39;ll be.&quot; &lt;I hope you can see your way clear to honor our pact, 
Tendou.&gt;

Ranma&#39;s heart fell into his stomach. He felt like crying, but 
that wouldn&#39;t be manly. &lt;Can&#39;t do that! Pops is always harpin&#39; on 
the manly bit. At least I can be *that* for Mom.&gt; He shuffled 
away, not wanting to be around his father for a while.


The next day dawned bright and clear, the very opposite of 
Ranma&#39;s mood. He shot Genma a deadly glare after being kicked 
awake. &lt;Don&#39;t push it, old man!&gt; After scarfing down the meager 
remains of the duck his father had left him, the two of them got 
through their morning sparring session in record time. Ranma 
pounded Genma into the dirt.

Genma was surly when he came to, and neither spoke as they broke 
camp and proceeded down the road to the next training spot.


A few hours later, the road began to climb slightly, and Ranma 
looked up. Genma had stopped and was comparing the Chinese 
writings on a sign to the writing in a small book he&#39;d been 
carrying around for some time. Ranma sighed, tired of the all-
too-familiar futility that his father personified in certain 
matters. A flash of sunlight caught his eye, and Ranma found 
himself walking to the edge of the road and looking down the 
slope.

A small brook wound its way through the stones. The clear water 
seemed to laugh as it bounded and flowed through the obstacles. 
In intermittent patches of soil, wildflowers had opened their 
springtime faces to the sun and waved in the slight breeze. It 
dazzled the eye with myriad shades of red, yellow, and blue.

Ordinarily, being who he was and doing what he did, Ranma 
wouldn&#39;t have had time to notice the small wonders that 
surrounded him. His current frame of mind, though, was in 
desperate need of a soothing balm, and gazing at the scene before 
him provided it. He became so lost in admiration that he failed 
to hear his father walk up behind him.

&quot;Beautiful...&quot; Ranma said to himself.

Genma smirked. &quot;Pretty, hey? I wonder how *manly* your mother 
would think you are, looking at pretty flowers and shiny water. 
&#39;Shall we stop and freshen up at the stream, dear Mother?&#39; 
Yessiree, Momma&#39;s manly man!&quot; Genma turned and walked back up the 
road, chortling.

Ranma was a statue. His father wasn&#39;t acting like he usually did 
when telling lies. He certainly ought to know; Genma told enough 
of them. That left only the truth. Ranma tried desperately to 
reconcile the picture of his mother his father was painting with 
the dim memories he had of warmth and security. He failed.

Hanging his head, he once again plodded up the road. &lt;Am I 
already a disappointment to Mom? What am I gonna do?!&gt; He trudged 
along, barely keeping his father in sight. &lt;Maybe Pops is right. 
I guess it&#39;s thievin&#39; for me. And the manly thing&#39;s always been 
there. I guess I know why, now. A *manly* thief. Yeah... right.&gt; 
Ranma picked up his pace and soon caught up to the man in the 
threadbare gi.


&quot;Welcome, Sirs, to Training Ground of Accursed Springs, 
Jusenkyo!&quot; Ranma and Genma looked out at the numerous pools, 
varying numbers of bamboo poles sticking out of each small body 
of water. Ranma was silent, his thoughts still miles away, over 
the China Sea.

&quot;Errr, thanks,&quot; Genma said uncomfortably. The Guide was not in 
his training plans for the day. He shrugged, dropped his pack, 
and leapt to the nearest bamboo pole. &quot;Ranma! Follow me!&quot;

&quot;ACK!! Sir! What you doing?! Very bad you fall in spring!&quot; The 
guide waved his arms frantically, trying to convey the urgency of 
the situation.

Jarred from his thoughts, Ranma looked up and sighed. He dropped 
his pack and jumped up to a pole, while his father bounced around 
from pole to pole, getting the feel of the place. In the 
meantime, the sun on the water had recaptured Ranma&#39;s attention, 
and he stared into the brilliance reflected up from the pools. 
&lt;Mother...&gt;

Ignoring the Chinese the yelling Guide had lapsed into, Genma 
stopped, readying himself for battle, and was not a little 
annoyed that his son seemed unaware of his surroundings. &lt;Bah! 
This&#39;ll teach him!&gt; Genma leapt at Ranma.

&lt;Mother--&gt; &quot;URK!!!&quot; He hadn&#39;t even noticed his father coming at 
him. Ranma described a textbook parabolic trajectory through the 
air, terminating in one of the pools nearby. Ranma sank beneath 
the surface, the water bubbled for a few seconds, and then all 
was quiet.

&quot;Oh, too bad,&quot; the Guide sang. &quot;Young Sir fall in Nyanniichuan. 
Very tragic story of young girl who drown there one-thousand, 
five-hundred year ago.&quot;

Genma hopped over and peered down into the water. He leaned back 
out of the spray as the surface broke, and one of the most 
beautiful girls Genma had ever clapped eyes on looked up at him.

&quot;Pops? EEP!!!&quot; Genma was frozen in shock, and Ranma wasn&#39;t much 
better, wondering what had happened to his voice.

&quot;You see, Sirs. Nyanniichuan. Whoever fall in spring take body of 
young girl.&quot;

Ranma *did* feel strange, so he looked down. He carefully felt 
his chest, his dread growing. Grimacing, he opened his gi and 
took in the sight of two magnificent breasts. &lt;I&#39;m a girl...&gt; her 
mind blandly stated. The color drained from her face, and her 
hands fell to her sides, the gi still open and Genma still 
staring. &lt;It&#39;s all gone. Everything that I am.&gt; Ranma looked up 
at her father. She misread his unreadable expression for a lack 
of emotion and caring instead of the shock that it was.

&quot;See?&quot; the Guide said. &quot;You young girl.&quot;

Ranma stared at her father, seeing no pity, no love, nothing. An 
all-too-easy picture with Genma. She began to shake, and terror 
temporarily washed away any sane response. Her worst fears rose 
unbidden, reflected in those dead eyes high on the pole. Manhood 
gone. Honor gone. Only shame.

With an inarticulate scream, Ranma leapt out of the spring and 
ran off back down the road that had brought them there. &lt;I&#39;m so 
sorry, Mother...&gt; She began to sob as she ran. The springs passed 
out of sight, and the road suddenly turned to the left. With a 
mighty leap, Ranma cleared the brush lining the turn and kept 
going straight, over the countryside.


Genma, perched atop a pole, was still staring at the spot where 
his son had become his daughter. He would come to regret his 
inaction at that precise moment for the rest of his life.

A few minutes later he shook himself out of his daze and speared 
the Guide with his eyes. &quot;What -- just -- happened?!&quot;

&quot;Young Sir fall in Nyanniichuan, Spring of Drowned Girl. Very 
tragic story of girl--&quot;

&quot;YES, YES! But what happened JUST NOW?!&quot;

The Guide shrugged. &quot;Fall in spring. Now young girl.&quot;

Genma boggled at the Guide. &quot;You&#39;ve GOT to be kidding--&quot;

&quot;Not trust eyes, no?&quot; The Guide pointed at the pool.

Genma looked down at the pool, and then back to the Guide. &quot;Can 
it be cured?&quot;

&quot;No cure.&quot; The Guide shook his head sadly.

&quot;Oh, no! NODOKA!!&quot;

&quot;Eh? What this nodoka?&quot;

&quot;NO, not what, who-- nevermind. What am I going to do?!&quot;

The Guide shrugged again. &quot;Find young Sir and take hot water.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?!&quot;

The Guide sighed. &lt;Tourists!&gt; &quot;Cold water make curse happen. Hot 
water change young Sir back... till next cold water, anyway.&quot;

Genma nearly fell off the pole and into the Nyanniichuan in 
relief. &quot;Thank you, Kami-sama!!&quot; he whispered fiercely. &lt;All 
isn&#39;t lost, Tendou!&gt;


The countryside had flattened out as Ranma had continued to run, 
and she now found herself in a stretch of well-worked farm plots. 
Pelting through the organized growth, she surprised many men and 
women working the fields. She didn&#39;t stop or even acknowledge 
them; she just ran.

In two hours, she finally reached a road and the end of her 
stamina. She instantly collapsed onto a clear spot, lying on her 
side and staring dully at the packed dirt. She had lapsed into 
emotional numbness and was content to feel nothing.


The sun had crawled across the sky a minute distance when the 
scuffling of hooves and the creak of an oxcart impinged on her 
awareness. Ranma rolled her eyes to look at an elderly woman in 
dull, mannish clothing looking down at her curiously.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; the woman asked in Mandarin. Ranma simply 
stared. &quot;Do you speak Han?&quot; Ranma recognized &quot;Han&quot; as the word 
for Mandarin in the tongue. She wearily shook her head.

The woman sat back on her seat and studied the girl. &lt;Hmmm. Not 
Chinese. Didn&#39;t think so to begin with. She looks a little like 
an American with the hair, at least, from what I&#39;ve seen in 
government films, yet the rest of her is from close by. Very 
pretty. *Too* pretty to leave on the road, especially in the 
shape she&#39;s in.&gt;

The woman scooted over on the bench and patted the empty space, 
pointedly looking at Ranma. Ranma blinked and, since she had no 
better offer - make that no other offer at all - climbed up next 
to the Good Samaritan.

The woman tapped herself on the sternum. &quot;Wong Liu,&quot; she said.

Ranma smiled tiredly and repeated the gesture. &quot;Saotome Ranma.&quot;

&lt;Strange name,&gt; Liu thought. A terrifying possibility occurred to 
her. &quot;Nyuuchiezuu?!&quot; she asked shakily.

Ranma looked at her strangely and shook her head, not 
understanding. Liu relaxed and chided herself; the Nyuuchiezuu 
would&#39;ve understood her. She shook the reins, and the two oxen 
pulling the cart began to shuffle down the road.

&quot;Arigatou, Wong-san.&quot;

Liu nodded, not understanding either but getting the gist of it. 
She watched Ranma lapse into staring at the passing road. &lt;Great 
pain, there. I wonder what happened.&gt;

The oxcart trundled slowly along and soon crested a hill, moving 
out of sight. They were headed North.

----------

[March 22, 1990]

To say Genma was exasperated was an understatement. After taking 
leave of the Guide, he&#39;d traveled back down the road to the next 
village. Asking after his son or the girl he could become, he 
discovered that no one recalled having seen them other than when 
they initially passed through. Or at least, that&#39;s what he&#39;d 
understood from the pidgin conversations he&#39;d endured to find 
that out. Thinking that Ranma could&#39;ve passed through unnoticed, 
he continued on to the next village, and the next, with the same 
result.

His failed search brought him back, on this day, to the leg of 
the road leading into Jusenkyo. He began to search the ground to 
either side. Some hours later, he discovered a deep set of small 
footprints just beyond the turn in the road. Cursing the fact 
that the trail was a week old, Genma sighted back up the road and 
then out over the countryside. He took off at a steady lope, 
keeping one eye peeled for sign of his child&#39;s passing.

----------

[March 23, 1990]

He was at an impasse. The trail terminated at a road, running 
North and South. Genma had been happy to discover that the 
occasional farmer he&#39;d run across had been able to convey to him 
that a redheaded girl had blown through some days before. He had 
continued on with a lighter heart. Until now.

There were no villages and few or no passers-by. The handful that 
he&#39;d asked simply shrugged and went on their way. He sat down on 
the ground and began to think, an activity that didn&#39;t come 
exactly natural to him. &lt;If I were Ranma, which way would I have 
gone? Hmmm. Where would I want to go? Well, home, of course. 
Which road will take me there? South!&gt; To his credit, Genma was 
thinking as would a normal person, one not having to deal with 
the trauma of a form-altering water curse... or living up to 
certain promises made.

Happy that he&#39;d deduced Ranma&#39;s intentions, Genma headed South. 
South would be towards the ports that could take one to Japan... 
and home.

----------

[October 10, 1991]

&lt;Nerima?!&gt; *COUGH, COUGH* &lt;Didn&#39;t Pops say isn&#39;t that a pretty 
rough ride back from where am I going, again?&gt;

Ranma hunched over and put her hands on her knees, waiting for 
the swirling in her brain to stop.

&lt;Gah. I&#39;m really sick. Can&#39;t even think straight.&gt;

After a few moments, Ranma slowly rose to a slumped-over position 
and looked around. Spying a place to sit down, unlikely to be 
bothered by anyone, she shuffled over and fell on the three steps 
leading to the entrance to an abandoned building. She lay there 
without moving for about ten minutes before crawling up into the 
alcove in complete exhaustion.

&quot;Mother, I miss you!&quot; she deliriously cried out in Chinese.

Ranma slept fitfully for almost a day-and-a-half, not moving from 
her cover.

----------

[February 2, 1991]

*THOK!* *Chunk*

*THOK!* *Chunk-chunk*

The head of an axe came to rest on a splitting-stump, and the 
wielder wiped his little bit of sweat against the sleeve of the 
simple Chinese tunic he wore. He breathed in the crisp late 
winter air and smiled. After years of the rough and tumble and 
scrapes of life on the road, the quiet serenity of this simple 
farm had done wonders for his state of mind and emotional health.

He picked up the last log to be split for the fire, for the cold 
days and nights still to come, and set it on the stump.

*THOK!* *Chunk-chunk*

Satisfied that enough wood had been split, more than enough, as 
Liu would probably point out, he quickly loaded the tinder onto 
the cart behind him. He shouldered the pull-straps and walked to 
the cottage.

Leaving the stacked cart outside, he went into the dwelling, 
shook the snow off his boots, and looked for a kettle. &lt;A nice 
cup would hit the spot!&gt; A commotion in the front room changed 
his mind, and he wandered in to see who was here.

A middle-aged man, one of the village elders, Ranma remembered, 
was speaking animatedly at Liu. He abruptly stopped speaking when 
Ranma entered. The two men looked at each other for a moment, and 
then the elder nodded to Liu and left.

Liu had slumped over in some kind of distress, and Ranma rushed 
over. &quot;What wrong, Liu-san? What he say?&quot; Liu had been patiently 
teaching Ranma the local version of Han, when time and the 
demands of the farm permitted, but he&#39;d stubbornly hung onto the 
Japanese honorifics. &quot;Liu-san?&quot;

&quot;Ranma.&quot; Liu turned around and fiercely hugged her friend and 
housemate. She leaned away and looked up at the young man. &quot;My, 
how you&#39;ve filled out since I first met you. But then, you were a 
girl when we crossed paths.&quot; Liu smirked mischievously at him.

&quot;Ah! No remind Ranma. You no answer, Liu-san.&quot;

The old woman sighed. &quot;If I were forty years younger and trained, 
I&#39;d fight them off and keep you for myself.&quot;

Ranma looked at her strangely. &quot;What you mean?&quot;

Liu&#39;s eyes began to tear. &quot;Time for you to go.&quot;

&quot;NANI?!&quot; Ranma had to steady himself a little. &quot;You no want 
Ranma? Chase off?&quot;

&quot;No, child. You&#39;re the best thing that&#39;s happened to this old 
woman since my husband died in one of the Party&#39;s stupid wars. 
No, people are coming for you. You must leave before they arrive, 
which is soon. They are already in the village.&quot;

&quot;People?&quot;

&quot;Nyuuchiezuu.&quot;

Ranma started. He remembered Liu saying that word when they first 
met, and he&#39;d since heard it spoken in whispers in the village. 
&quot;Who Nyuuchiezuu?&quot;

&quot;Bad news. Women warriors. They have a village near Jusenkyo, and 
they claim Jusenkyo as theirs. Word of the few times you&#39;ve 
changed in public must&#39;ve finally gotten to them. I would not see 
you cast into their hands. Men are treated very badly by them. 
Many acquaintances of mine have lost their able-bodied menfolk to 
Nyuuchiezuu raids.&quot;

Ranma stood straight. &quot;Martial artist. Fight off!&quot;

&quot;Fight off twenty well-armed and well-trained warriors? Most 
carry swords and know how to use them.&quot;

Ranma wilted. &quot;Call, ano, authorities?&quot;

&quot;They would ignore it, as they have since anyone can remember. 
There is no choice, child. You must leave. Now!&quot;

Clearly unhappy, Ranma tried to stand his ground.

Liu sighed and hugged Ranma again. &quot;It is my wish. Will you go 
against my wishes?&quot;

&quot;...!&quot; After Liu released him, Ranma sat down heavily in a nearby 
chair, the weight of his situation bearing down on him. &quot;I honor 
you wish,&quot; he whispered.

Liu pasted a smile on her face. &quot;Good! Go pack. Make it quick. 
I&#39;ll put together a little food for you.&quot;

Ranma dragged himself up and entered the one bedroom of the 
house. He looked at Liu&#39;s bed against the wall on one side of the 
room, and then at his against the opposite wall. &lt;I&#39;ll miss this 
place. And Liu.&gt; Sighing again, he quickly gathered his things 
into a makeshift pack and returned to Liu.

&quot;That was fast!&quot;

Ranma just shrugged, depression beginning to settle in.

&quot;Here.&quot; She handed him a bundle of hardy foodstuffs wrapped up in 
cloth. Ranma took the bundle and set in on the counter. He 
grabbed the old woman up in a crushing hug. &quot;You mother for 
Ranma,&quot; Ranma choked out. &quot;Help Ranma. Teach Ranma. Make feel 
good even with curse. No want leave!&quot;

Liu, crying freely, beaned him on the head. Surprised, Ranma let 
her go. He then smiled at her wet face. She swatted his behind. 
&quot;&#39;Mother&#39; says go! The Elders will stall only so long with the 
Nyuuchiezuu. Go!&quot;

Ranma took Liu&#39;s care package in hand and stumbled out the back 
door, dazed by the sudden tragic turn in his life.

&quot;Go South!&quot; Liu called. Ranma nodded absently and took off across 
the field. He was glad Liu couldn&#39;t see his tears as he turned 
around one last time to see his friend. Liu shooed him, and he 
turned, disappearing over the rise.


Liu sobbed for a few minutes, and then shuffled in and put the 
kettle on. There was no way she&#39;d get anything done, today. Her 
heart just wasn&#39;t in it. She dried her face and waited.

Soon, the kettle was hot enough, and Liu poured herself a cup of 
tea. She sat down in her chair in the front room and brooded.

The front door abruptly shattered and fell in. Several grim 
women, garishly dressed and armed to the teeth, walked in.

&quot;Tell us where he is,&quot; the young leader with the purple hair 
commanded.

Liu sipped her tea and smiled. Sixty years of manhandling a farm 
had made her tough, as well. &quot;Gone. Back to Jusenkyo to look for 
the Nanniichuan.&quot;

&quot;You lie. That doesn&#39;t work.&quot;

Liu was genuinely surprised. &quot;He didn&#39;t know. Hmmm, if you were 
cursed with a *man&#39;s* body and not being any wiser, wouldn&#39;t you 
think of the Nyanniichuan?&quot;

The lead Amazon chewed on her lip, digesting the possibility. She 
quickly made her mind up. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

The women filed out and disappeared into the fields.

Liu set her cup down and went out back to find some boards to 
nail over the front doorway. It would be a cold night, regardless 
of what temporary measures she took. She noted the oversized 
stack of chopped wood in the cart by the backdoor and smiled, 
crying anew and blessing her one-time son.

[October 11, 1991]

Cold rains had been drenching the Nerima Ward of the Greater 
Tokyo Metropolitan Area for the last two days, and pedestrians 
were going out for the evening dressed in warm and somewhat 
water-proof clothing and toting countless umbrellas, most of them 
yellow.

One man, carrying such a yellow umbrella, was stepping briskly 
along the shiny streets. He was returning from a call for his 
services, midwiving a young woman trapped in an elevator due to a 
sudden power outage, and was humming a happy little tune. He 
smiled as he stomped in a puddle just for the joy of it. Of 
course, the yellow rain boots he also wore took away any worries. 
He looked up and saw the entrance to the clinic he ran a couple 
of blocks up. He quickened his pace.

A loud and congested sneeze brought him to a halt. Tracking the 
noise, he spied a curled-up figure in the entry alcove of an 
abandoned storefront. Normally, the derelict figure would not 
have been approached, but this particular man was unusual in two 
important respects.

First, he was a doctor. Helping others was his calling in life, 
even if many of his colleagues would still have passed by, 
cultural biases directing their behavior. Second, he was a top-
notch martial artist, and his sensitivities had been attuned to 
pick up on certain aptitudes and qualities in the people he met. 
His sensitivities were screaming at him as he looked at the young 
girl wedged into the alcove. The girl&#39;s aura, while unfocused and 
suffering from illness, was astoundingly strong. Adjusting his 
glasses, Dr. Ono Toufuu crossed the street to stand over the 
girl.

&quot;Konbanwa.&quot;

With bleary eyes, the young girl looked the man over. Toufuu 
grimaced as a coughing fit shook her slight frame, and she spat a 
mass of green phlegm at the other wall of the alcove.

&quot;You&#39;re ill. Influenza, I&#39;d expect.&quot;

The girl focussed on him again. &quot;What&#39;s it to ya?&quot; she muttered.

Toufuu sighed and squatted down at the entrance, bringing him eye 
to eye with her bloodshot crystal blues. &quot;I&#39;m a doctor.&quot;

Ranma snorted and looked away. &quot;So what. I ain&#39;t got no money. I 
ain&#39;t got nothin&#39;.&quot;

Toufuu looked at her critically. &quot;Would you rather die in the 
cold?&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; she rasped. &quot;There&#39;re worse things.&quot;

The despair in her voice rocked Toufuu, but he managed not to let 
it show. The girl looked back and studied him.

&quot;You ain&#39;t no doctor. You&#39;re a martial artist. From what I know, 
they don&#39;t mix.&quot;

Toufuu adjusted his glasses again. &quot;Then maybe you don&#39;t know as 
much as you think.&quot; He reached into his overcoat and pulled out 
his card, handing it to her. She took it guardedly, and looked it 
over. &lt;Ono Toufuu...&gt;

She flipped the card back at him. &quot;Okay. So you&#39;re a doctor *and* 
a martial artist. Don&#39;t mean nothin&#39; ta me.&quot; She turned back to 
her examination of a stone in the wall across from her.

Instead of answering, Toufuu stood and held out his hand, waiting 
patiently. The girl looked at him askance. &quot;Told ya. Got no 
money.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ll work it off when you&#39;re better.&quot; The hand still 
waited. The girl bit her lip. Her fevered mind was not clear 
enough for her to make command decisions, so she had to decide if 
she could trust him. She&#39;d been burned often enough over the last 
few months, trusting when she shouldn&#39;t have.

Her body convulsed as another fit took her. She stared at the 
mottled blob she&#39;d just ejected from her lungs, and that made her 
decision. Without looking, she scrabbled for his hand and found 
it.

Toufuu smiled and hauled her to her feet. She stumbled, but he 
caught her, unintentionally mashing her breasts. Once he got her 
back on her feet, he said, &quot;Ano... gomen.&quot;

The girl snorted again. &quot;Eight months on the road. Ya get used to 
it. Perverts, all of &#39;em!&quot;

Toufuu nodded and began to walk her down the street. &quot;By the way, 
is there a name to go with the attitude?&quot;

The girl thought for a moment. &quot;Ranma.&quot; At the doctor&#39;s 
hesitation, she said, &quot;That&#39;s all... for now.&quot;

&quot;Ranma,&quot; Toufuu said. &quot;Interesting name.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma chortled raggedly, &quot;sort of like bein&#39; named &#39;East 
Wind&#39;.&quot;

Toufuu laughed out loud and was graced with a smile from Ranma. 
&quot;You get used to it,&quot; he said.

The pair limped up the final two blocks to the clinic entrance, 
each having passed the first of many tests between them.


&quot;First is a warm bath... or shower, if you prefer. Then I want to 
examine you.&quot; Toufuu helped Ranma up the stairs to his apartment.

Ranma started, but the sudden motion brought on another fit. When 
it subsided, she said, &quot;Warm shower. May not be a good idea. The 
warm, I mean.&quot;

&quot;Huh? Well, you certainly can&#39;t take a *cold* one.&quot; They began 
climbing the stairs again.

&quot;Believe in magic, sensei?&quot; Ranma had to stop at the top of the 
stairs and catch her breath.

Toufuu looked at her oddly. &quot;Maybe. I&#39;ve certainly seen some 
strange things in my studies. Why?&quot;

Ranma barked a ragged laugh. &quot;Well, it&#39;s about to get stranger. 
You may wanna toss me back out, when you see.&quot; When it was 
apparent nothing more was forthcoming, Toufuu supported Ranma 
through the door and into his bathroom. He moved to leave.

&quot;No. Stay. Might as well see this now.&quot; The pain in Ranma&#39;s voice 
was quite apparent. &quot;Tired of trying ta hide this. Folks chasin&#39; 
me away when they see.&quot; Ranma began to slough off her clothing, 
and Toufuu started looking uncomfortable.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, sensei. I ain&#39;t got nothin&#39; ya ain&#39;t already 
seen... yet.&quot; Ranma snickered to herself. Toufuu wondered if the 
fever was affecting her mind.

Now fully nude, Ranma walked carefully to the shower and turned 
on the hot water. When it had heated sufficiently, she turned on 
the cold to adjust the temperature. Before she stepped in, Ranma 
looked back at her benefactor.

&quot;Don&#39;t blink, now,&quot; she giggled hoarsely.

&lt;Yes, definitely the fev--&gt; Toufuu&#39;s jaw dropped as the pretty 
little redhead suddenly added several kilos of mass, rose in 
height, and became obviously male, her... his hair shifting to 
black. The running shower water had visually fuzzed the process, 
but it was clear enough. A memory of something once read tickled 
the back of his mind, but the shock was too much for his mental 
functions to dredge up.

Ranma chose a cloth and some soap and began to scrub his body. He 
looked over. Toufuu was still staring, although he was in the 
process of slowly closing his mouth. &quot;Shocking, ne?&quot; a deeper 
voice inquired.

Toufuu shook himself and adjusted his glasses out of habit. 
&quot;Um... There must be quite a tale behind that, er, son. Ano... 
are you male or female?&quot;

&quot;Male. The girl body&#39;s a curse.&quot;

Old information flooded Toufuu&#39;s mind. Curse... Hot water... 
&quot;Jusenkyou,&quot; he said.

Ranma looked over sharply, and then slowly turned back to his 
washing. &quot;When... when I&#39;m finished, I&#39;ll leave. Ya don&#39;t want 
some freak hangin&#39;--&quot;

&quot;Nonsense.&quot; Toufuu had gotten over the shock and was speculating 
on the difficulties such a condition must&#39;ve caused on the road. 
&quot;The last thing you need is to be back out in that weather. 
Besides, you&#39;ll still have to work off your treatments, and I 
have need of an assistant. I think you&#39;ll do fine.&quot;

Ranma was in shock, this time. He stared at the kindly doctor for 
several heartbeats before falling to his knees, shaking. Toufuu 
moved to help, but before he got there, Ranma had passed out from 
the various kinds of fatigue he&#39;d been suffering from. Toufuu 
shut off the water and picked Ranma up in his arms. He tottered 
down the stairs and into the examination room, laying the 
unconscious boy on the table dominating the area.

Toufuu sat heavily in a chair and considered the young man. &lt;Such 
pain.&gt; His eyes refocused, and he studied Ranma&#39;s aura. &lt;And such 
potential. I&#39;d be no healer to let that waste away.&gt; His mind 
made up and his intentions firmed, Toufuu went about his 
examination.

----------

[November 3, 1991]

Ranma was mopping the waiting room for the clinic, in which he 
worked and lived. The regular patient hours were over, but that 
didn&#39;t mean the visitors stopped. There were frequently needs to 
be met off-hours, and Ranma had come to understand and enjoy the 
constant ebb and flow of crises around his patron. His respect 
for Toufuu-sensei grew daily as he witnessed healing arts 
performed and little kindnesses bestowed. He&#39;d also learned to 
get the hell out when a certain young woman came by to visit or 
borrow books.

He chuckled. That certain young lady, a one Tendou Kasumi, had 
even captivated Ranma a little, but it was clear she was 
interested in Toufuu. And it was more than clear that Toufuu was 
plain, head-over-heels in love with Kasumi. Everyone knew it, 
except, it seems, Kasumi herself. &lt;Odd,&gt; he thought, &lt;she doesn&#39;t 
really strike me as the dense type, although she acts like it 
sometimes.&gt; A rapid knocking at the entrance interrupted his 
musings.

Ranma walked over, unlocked the door, and stuck his head out. 
&quot;Hai?&quot;

The girl standing there blinked and then smiled. &quot;Oh, you must 
Toufuu-sensei&#39;s new assistant. Kasumi told us about you.&quot;

Ranma nodded. &quot;Yeah.&quot; &lt;Man, she&#39;s cute!&gt; &quot;Are you Kasumi&#39;s 
sister?&quot;

The girl twirled her foot on the pavement. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m Tendou 
Akane.&quot; Akane started when she realized she was blushing. &lt;ARGH! 
It&#39;s just another *boy*!&gt; Schooling her features, she said, &quot;Um, 
is Toufuu-sensei in? I kinda, er, hurt myself.&quot;

Ranma wondered at the change in her manner. &quot;Uh, yeah. C&#39;mon in. 
Sensei says the Tendous are always welcome.&quot; He laughed. 
&quot;Especially Kasumi.&quot; His good humor fled when he saw the anger 
rise in Akane. &quot;Heh, anyway, just a minute.&quot; He hotfooted it into 
the examination room.

Toufuu was busy inventorying his prescription medications. &quot;Errr, 
Sensei? There&#39;s a Tendou Akane to see ya. Might wanna be careful. 
Seems mad about somethin&#39;.&quot;

Toufuu laughed. &quot;Akane does have something of a temper.&quot; He 
paused. &quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to tell them? It might help 
you find your mother.&quot;

Ranma sighed and fidgeted. He finally shook his head. &quot;No, if old 
man Tendou is a friend of Pops, then tellin&#39; him will only cause 
trouble. And anyway, I don&#39;t figure Mom&#39;ll wanna see me with this 
curse, not from what I&#39;ve heard. The Tendou girls wouldn&#39;t 
understand what it&#39;s like, the thing with Mom. They&#39;d probably 
try ta help and only make it worse.&quot;

Toufuu&#39;s mouth drew a line. That was a lot of thoughts out of 
Ranma at one go, and it was obvious from the various 
conversations they&#39;d shared, the boy had considered virtually all 
the angles. The revelation about the Tendo Ryuu of Musabetsu 
Kakutou had initially brought Ranma some hope, but he soon 
remembered his father speaking of a Tendou he&#39;d trained with and 
had probably correctly deduced that the local Tendou was one and 
the same.

Ranma had put it best once, he remembered. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. 
Not anymore. I was livin&#39; those last days, thinkin&#39; of Mom. I 
don&#39;t think Pops was lyin&#39;, so if she expects me to be like Pops, 
well... let her believe it as long as she can. I won&#39;t be the 
reason she don&#39;t no more.&quot;

Finished with his reverie, Toufuu said, &quot;I understand, Ranma. 
Show Akane in, why don&#39;t you?&quot;


Akane made many visits over the next couple of weeks, sometimes 
for the sparsest of reasons. Everytime she talked with Ranma, she 
had to remind herself that he was just a boy. Nothing more.

But Ranma was different. He was generally quiet, didn&#39;t do 
anything to provoke her, and was genuinely funny on the rare 
occasions he let his humor show through. She also felt a kindred 
spirit in him - someone who&#39;d suffered great pain and was 
persevering.

Eventually, she stopped coming by on the pretense of seeing 
Toufuu and simply came to visit with Ranma. No one had really 
caught on to what she was doing, not even her nosy sister. Akane 
relished the haven Toufuu&#39;s waiting room had become and the 
friendly male voice that would talk with her.

It was in the third week that she stepped over the line.


Akane bounced happily into the waiting room and, as expected, saw 
Ranma waiting there. The fact that he was working was incidental. 
She plopped down on the couch next to where he was sweeping and 
smiled.

&quot;Hi!&quot;

&quot;Hi, yourself!&quot; Ranma said, putting down the broom and sitting 
next to her. &quot;How was school?&quot;

&quot;Oh, you know. Same old stuff.&quot;

&quot;I hear you&#39;re havin&#39; some troubles in the mornin&#39;s.&quot;

Akane scowled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I can handle it,&quot; she said 
sharply.

Ranma made a peace gesture by holding his hands up with the palms 
out. Akane grinned ruefully.

&quot;Gomen. I shouldn&#39;t have snapped at you like that. Let&#39;s forget 
it.&quot; She thought for a second. &quot;By the way, can I ask you a 
question?&quot;

Ranma&#39;s eyes flashed, but he stayed steady. &quot;I guess...&quot;

&quot;Why aren&#39;t you attending Furinkan?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that,&quot; he said relieved. &quot;Errr, Sensei got me some private 
tutors, instead.&quot;

&quot;Did he get you a speech coach, too?&quot; she smirked.

&quot;Ha. Ha.&quot; Ranma made a face at her, and Akane giggled. It wound 
down, and she turned serious.

&quot;Really, though. Aren&#39;t tutors expensive?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but Sensei trades doctor visits for them. He says free 
medical stuff is very, ah, persuasive.&quot;

Akane smiled knowingly. &quot;I can imagine. Nabiki was very proud of 
herself when she finagled a family rate out of him.&quot;

Akane&#39;s mood abruptly shifted when she clasped her hands together 
in her lap and stared at her fingers. &quot;Ah... Ranma?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Ranma&#39;s mind had wandered somewhere, and he looked at her 
again. &quot;Gomen.&quot;

&quot;Um, I was wondering,&quot; Akane straightened the skirt to her 
uniform, &quot;if, ah, you&#39;d like to, erm, comeoverfordinnertonight.&quot;

Ranma squinched his nose, trying to decipher the last run-
together bit, but when he did, he grew afraid. He stood up and 
grabbed his broom, resuming his chores.

Akane looked at him with a slightly hurt expression. &quot;Ranma?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Akane, but I can&#39;t. I, uh, have stuff ta do.&quot; He 
busied himself sweeping the same spot of floor.

Akane&#39;s slight hurt became anger. She stood up and stomped in 
front of him. &quot;And WHY NOT?! Are we Tendous not good enough or 
something? Am *I* not good enough?!&quot;

Ranma sighed and stopped sweeping. He leaned against the broom 
and closed his eyes. &quot;Nothin&#39; like that. I just... can&#39;t. That&#39;s 
all.&quot; Ranma resumed sweeping.

&quot;What?! You can tell me!&quot; Akane pleaded. Ranma stopped again, and 
looked her in the eye.

&quot;No. I can&#39;t. You wouldn&#39;t understand. No one understands.&quot; He 
shuffled across the room, moving the broom back and forth in 
front of him.

Akane stood there a moment, tears beginning to run down her face, 
and then she ran out the door. Ranma stared at the drops of 
moisture on the floor and cursed himself. &lt;Shouldn&#39;t have let 
myself get so close! Damn it!&gt;

&quot;Ranma.&quot;

Ranma jumped in surprise and spun around. Toufuu stood there 
looking at him sadly. &quot;Would it have been so bad?&quot;

&quot;No... If it&#39;d been anyone but the Tendous, no, it wouldn&#39;t.&quot;

Toufuu shook his head. &quot;You can&#39;t hide forever, you know. 
Someday, you&#39;ll have to let someone else in.&quot;

Ranma didn&#39;t answer and went back to sweeping.

----------

[December 21, 1991]

A few more weeks had passed, and Akane had stopped by only once, 
and it had been to really see the doctor. Ranma could tell she&#39;d 
had to steel herself. He also felt her longing gaze when his back 
was turned. He&#39;d tried to say something to her before she walked 
out, but the words wouldn&#39;t come. That was one week ago.

Ranma walked down from the apartment he and Toufuu shared, a 
satisfying lunch settling nicely in his stomach. He went to the 
front door, collected the day&#39;s mail, and set it on Toufuu&#39;s desk 
in his office. He walked outside and set about cleaning the 
sidewalk and steps.

He&#39;d brought a scrubbing brush and a bucket with him, and the 
bucket was soon full from the outside tap. Ranma squirted some 
cleaner into the water and gently stirred it with a stick he kept 
for the purpose. Holding the bucket at arms length, he climbed 
the few stairs to the clinic entrance and set the bucket down. He 
carefully dipped the bristles of the brush into the liquid and 
swirled it slowly. Applying the wet brush to the stone, he 
scrubbed at the dirt and algal growth that had appeared since the 
last cleaning. He worked diligently, part of his mind on the 
work, part on the passers-by, and the rest lost to thought. He&#39;d 
nearly finished the upper landing, when one part of his awareness 
noted that someone had stopped.

&quot;Ranma.&quot;

He turned to see Akane standing at the bottom step. Overflowing 
water washed shallowly around her shoes. &quot;Hi, Akane.&quot; He went 
back to scrubbing.

&quot;I, um, wanted to apologize for making a big fuss that day.&quot; 
Akane&#39;s head was down, and her hands were clasped in front of 
her.

Ranma sat back on his wet shins, mentally keeping track of how 
much of his body was damp.

&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s... no big deal.&quot;

&quot;Yes it is!! I...&quot; She stopped, then more calmly, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t 
have pushed like that. Whatever it is that you won&#39;t say, I hope 
someday you can tell me.&quot;

Ranma didn&#39;t say anything for a moment. Then he bent back over 
and resumed scrubbing. &quot;It&#39;s not... easy.&quot;

A running man came into view up the street.

Ranma stopped and thought for a second, then said, &quot;It&#39;s outside 
of what most folks want to believe... or can believe.&quot; He sat 
back on his shins again. &quot;There&#39;re some stuff in the world, 
Akane, that... that...&quot;

The running man was abruptly upon them. He dashed up the steps 
and blew through the open door, kicking Ranma&#39;s bucket as he 
went.

Akane gasped. Where that cute guy had sat, the guy Akane had 
finally realized had wormed his way into her heart, was a 
beautiful redheaded girl. Her wet clothes clung to her body, 
leaving no doubt as to the completeness of her gender. Akane&#39;s 
head began shaking back and forth.

Ranma looked down and closed her eyes. &quot;Now do you understand?&quot; 
she sadly asked, the pitch of her voice punctuating the change. 
She looked up to see Akane running back the way she came. &quot;No... 
I guess ya don&#39;t.&quot;

Without bothering to return to her normal gender, Ranma bent down 
and mechanically continued to clean.


After dumping the remaining water in the bucket down the short 
stairway, Ranma put the cleaning materials up and shuffled back 
into the clinic, wringing her clothes out as best she could 
without taking them off. The man that had triggered her change 
passed her on his way out, giving her an odd look.

&quot;Caught you, huh?&quot; Smiling, Toufuu was leaning against the 
doorway to the examination room. Ranma nodded.

&quot;Did I hear you talking to someone?&quot;

&quot;Akane... stopped by... to say she was sorry for gettin&#39; mad at 
me.&quot; Ranma kicked off her slippers and walked towards the stairs 
to the apartment level. Toufuu&#39;s smile had dropped.

&quot;Did she--&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;And nothin&#39;.&quot; Ranma stopped at the first step. &quot;She ran off.&quot; 
She put a damp hand on the wall and put her forehead against it. 
&quot;I hate this place, sometimes.&quot;

A grim line formed between Toufuu&#39;s lips. &quot;Careful what you wish 
for.&quot;

Ranma turned her head against her hand. &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Come back down when you&#39;re cleaned up. We have to talk.&quot;


Male and freshly laundered, Ranma went into Toufuu&#39;s office and 
plopped down in the patient chair.

&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;

Toufuu leaned back and adjusted his glasses. He picked up a piece 
of paper from the desk and waved it in the air.

&quot;This came in the mail, today. I&#39;m moving.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Ranma sat up straight in the chair.

&quot;I&#39;ve been offered a teaching practice at my old university. It&#39;s 
not something I can turn down and expect to advance in my 
career.&quot;

Ranma settled back and let the information soak in.

Toufuu allowed him a minute to think, then said, &quot;So. You have a 
choice, now. Do you want to stay here, or come with me?&quot;

Ranma snorted. &quot;What choice?&quot; He then reconsidered his words. 
&quot;No, that&#39;s not fair to ya.&quot; He clasped his hands in his lap. &quot;If 
ya want me, I&#39;ll gladly come with ya. You&#39;re... well...&quot;

Toufuu smiled warmly. &quot;I think I know what you&#39;re trying to say. 
Which brings me to another matter, one I was planning on waiting 
till Christmas to tell you, but I think you could stand to hear 
it now.&quot;

He definitely had Ranma&#39;s attention.

The doctor opened a lower drawer to his desk and began pulling 
papers out, continuing to speak as he did so.

&quot;I have, over the last couple of months, come to an interesting 
conclusion concerning you.&quot; He stopped what he was doing and 
pointedly looked at Ranma. &quot;I&#39;ve decided that my life would be 
much poorer without you in it.&quot; He resumed scrabbling around in 
his desk drawer. Ranma gulped, nervous as to the coming 
revelation.

&quot;I&#39;ve come to depend on you for help in the clinic, on your 
friendship, and...&quot; he plopped a stack of papers on the leather 
desktop, &quot;the sense of family you&#39;ve brought to my life. The 
whole thing actually quite surprised me, when I realized it.&quot;

Toufuu shrugged and continued, looking Ranma in the eye again, 
&quot;And since you&#39;re not willing to seek out your own family... 
That&#39;s still how you feel about it, ne?&quot;

Ranma nodded.

&quot;I still don&#39;t think things are as bad as you paint them, but 
then, I didn&#39;t experience your father first hand, as you did. If 
half of what you&#39;ve told me is true, well... I&#39;m not sure I want 
you going back to him, either. However, this family-name limbo 
you&#39;re in is going to cause you some problems... very soon.&quot;

Ranma was silent.

&quot;I have a solution, if you&#39;ll agree to it.&quot;

Ranma leaned forward, indicating for him to continue.

&quot;I&#39;d like to transfer you to the Ono family register, adopted as 
my son.&quot;

Ranma fell out of his chair. Toufuu stood and looked over his 
desk. &quot;Ranma?&quot;

Ranma climbed up from the floor. &quot;Ah! HAHA! WOW!! I wasn&#39;t 
expecting that!&quot; Ranma settled himself back into the chair, a 
silly grin covering his face. &quot;I... uh... Jeez! Why? I mean, 
don&#39;t get me wrong, but you&#39;ve only known me a couple&#39;a months. 
Why?&quot;

The chair creaked as Toufuu seated himself. &quot;I like to think I&#39;m 
a good judge of character, Ranma, and from what I&#39;ve seen, you&#39;d 
bring honor to the Ono name, regardless of what you do with your 
life. Besides,&quot; his eyes glinted from behind his glasses, &quot;you 
have certain, ah, potentials that shouldn&#39;t be wasted.&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t really talked to you about this yet, since your 
recovery from one of the worst cases of flu I&#39;ve ever seen was 
slow, but one of the things I was trained to do was to read a 
person&#39;s aura. When I first met you, out on the street, ill and 
confused, your aura was inconceivably strong. The first thing 
that came to my mind was that this girl... sorry, this person has 
amazing potential as a healer.&quot;

Ranma almost fell out of his chair again.

&quot;A healer?&quot; he squeaked, gripping the chair arms.

&quot;I feel that once my old teachers get a good look at *you*, 
they&#39;ll be beating a path to your door.&quot;

&quot;But... but... I ain&#39;t had no proper schoolin&#39;. Hell, I can&#39;t 
even talk right!&quot;

Toufuu laughed. &quot;All that can be fixed.&quot; He turned serious. 
&quot;Ranma, you don&#39;t have to be a healer. You can be anything you 
want, and my adoption offer will still stand. It isn&#39;t contingent 
on your career choice.&quot;

Ranma smiled in acknowledgement. 

&quot;I just want you to think about it, and I want you to know that 
you have great potential for a healer. Just think about it. We&#39;ve 
certainly got some time. We&#39;ve got to move, after all, and you 
have much tutoring to finish before you have to make any 
decision.&quot;

Ranma steepled his fingers and moved them up and down for several 
moments in the silence of the room. An expression of sadness 
washed over his features.

&quot;What... what about the, ah, oldest Tendou daughter?&quot; he asked.

Toufuu bowed his head and studied his intertwined fingers. After 
a moment, he said, &quot;I... I... ...!&quot;

&quot;Sensei?&quot; Ranma prodded him softly.

Toufuu looked up, and Ranma saw a single tear tracking down his 
right cheek. The doctor&#39;s eyes were unfocused, looking into some 
deep part of his psyche. Ranma chose to wait him out.

After about five minutes of silence, Toufuu&#39;s eyes abruptly 
focused on Ranma. &quot;What...?&quot; He sighed. &quot;How long was I gone, 
that time?&quot;

Ranma snickered. &quot;Not very.&quot;

A rueful smile tweaked the corners of the older man&#39;s mouth. 
&quot;We&#39;re a pair, aren&#39;t we? The women we, er, &#39;like a lot&#39; are 
sisters, but we&#39;re separated from them: me by what happens to me 
on the inside, and you by what happens to you on the outside.&quot;

Ranma shrunk into his chair.

&quot;Gomen,&quot; Toufuu said. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to pick at your wound.&quot; He 
took in a deep breath and exhaled. &quot;But it doesn&#39;t change 
anything. I haven&#39;t been able to, um, get past certain, ah, 
inhibitions before this came up,&quot; he wagged the same piece of 
paper, &quot;and now it&#39;s a moot point. I can no more refuse this than 
I can refuse eat or drink. I owe these people honor debts. I&#39;m 
sure you understand.&quot;

Ranma slowly blinked.

Toufuu pasted a smile on his face. &quot;So! What about my offer?&quot;

Ranma shook himself and settled into his chair, going back to 
squinching his fingers up and down. He thought about what the 
step would mean. It was a divorce of sorts, a cutting-off from 
who he&#39;d been and from the people, or person, who had gotten him 
there. &lt;Pops!&gt; he thought, frowning. &lt;Well, he&#39;ll be happy about 
one thing. I don&#39;t plan on givin&#39; up the Art.&gt; Ranma abruptly 
stood and bowed formally to his mentor.

&quot;I would be honored to be added to your family, Sensei.&quot; He 
straightened and looked at Toufuu with a mercenary gleam in his 
eye. &quot;And I *will* think about what ya said... &#39;bout healin&#39;. But 
ya hafta teach me what ya know about martial arts. I seen ya 
practicin&#39;, and ya got some interestin&#39; moves.&quot;

Toufuu smiled at the playful change in Ranma&#39;s demeanor and 
slapped his hand on the desk. &quot;Deal!&quot;

[April 4, 1993]

&quot;Saotome-kun!&quot;

A sopping wet Genma stood in the foyer of the Tendou household. 
The storm raging outside had blown his umbrella away, not that it 
had helped much; the rain was almost horizontal.

&quot;Tendou.&quot;

&quot;Come in, come in! Good lord, let&#39;s get you out of those clothes! 
Kasumi!!&quot; Tendou Soun called back into the main part of the 
house.

Tendou Kasumi stepped out of the kitchen. &quot;Yes, Father?&quot;

&quot;Get one of my gi&#39;s, please. My friend, here, is cold to the 
bone. And some tea and a blanket, when you can.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Father.&quot; Ever the dutiful daughter, Kasumi went about 
gathering the necessary items. Soun led his silent friend to the 
bathing room. Kasumi followed shortly after with a fresh gi.

&quot;Here, Saotome-kun. Get cleaned up and join me in the tearoom.&quot; 
The silent man nodded, and Soun and his daughter left him to his 
ablutions.


Soun sipped his tea and watched the rain alternate between 
falling down at an angle to blowing directly across his field of 
view. Kasumi walked in, drying her hands on a dishtowel.

&quot;Father, did you say &#39;Saotome&#39;?&quot; She knelt at the table. &quot;Is that 
the same man you were telling us about from that postcard a long 
time ago? Something about a prearranged marriage?&quot;

Soun set his tea down and sighed. &quot;Yes, daughter. That&#39;s him, and 
he was supposed to have been here shortly after we received that 
card. Something must have happened, since he&#39;s here now, years 
late, without a son.&quot; He reached over and patted her hand. &quot;Let&#39;s 
wait and see what he has to say.&quot;

Kasumi nodded, settling in, and poured herself a cup of tea, as 
well.


Genma, scrubbed and in a clean, if somewhat tight, gi, hesitated 
before joining his old friend. There would be no celebrations 
from this visit. Genma hung his head. When Ranma had disappeared, 
a large part of his soul had disappeared with him. Genma 
straightened and schooled his features. Time to tell Tendou the 
news. He walked into to the tearoom, catching the attention of 
Soun and his daughter.

&quot;Satome-kun. Please, sit and get warm.&quot;

Kasumi stood with a blanket in her hand and walked behind Genma, 
setting the cover over his shoulders. Genma smiled his thanks and 
drew it around him.

&quot;I gather by your unannounced appearance - without a son - that 
your news is not good,&quot; Soun began as Kasumi took her place at 
the table again.

Genma shook his head sadly and took the cup of tea proffered by 
Kasumi. He took a warming sip and said, &quot;I lost him, Tendou. The 
last I saw of him was in the Bayankala mountain range, Northern 
China... over two years ago.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Kasumi whispered. &quot;What happened? Did he run off?&quot; Soun 
nodded at her questions.

&quot;Yes, but not like you might think. *sigh* Do you believe in 
magic, Tendou?&quot;

&quot;Well... I think so. The, um, Master certainly knew an odd thing 
or two.&quot;

&quot;Believe *me*, then. It does exist, and in ways you can&#39;t 
imagine. It all began at our last training stop before we were 
supposed to leave China, a place called Jusenkyou...&quot;


&quot;...and the girl&#39;s trail stopped and disappeared at that road. No 
one had seen her after that. I assumed she would head South, to 
the ports, but I never caught a whiff. I&#39;ve searched high and low 
for many, many months, but it was like she, er, he had vanished 
off the face of the Earth.&quot; Never once did Genma refer to his 
child by name.

The room was very quiet for several long moments. Soun&#39;s eyes had 
begun to tear; he feared for the fate of the boy and for the 
future of the Art.

Kasumi was lost in her own thoughts. After the furor from the 
announcement that one of them would have to marry Saotome&#39;s son 
had died down, Kasumi had gradually begun to entertain happy 
little fantasies about this mysterious young man. Now knowing why 
he&#39;d never arrived, her heart went out to him. She would pray for 
him at the shrine of her ancestors.

&quot;Father? What was his name again?&quot;

&quot;Ranma. It was Ranma,&quot; Soun said sadly.

&quot;Oh, yes. I remember now.&quot; A puzzled expression settled on her 
face. &lt;That&#39;s funny. I knew a Ranma not too long ago.&gt;

Soun noticed his daughter&#39;s expression. &quot;Something wrong, Kasumi-
chan?&quot;

Kasumi jumped a little, and then waved her hand in a dismissive 
gesture. &quot;No, no. Nothing to do with this, I&#39;m sure.&quot;

Sound turned to his friend and began to console him.

Kasumi, however, was still thinking. &lt;What was his family name? I 
don&#39;t think I ever knew. I thought he was related to Toufuu-
sensei somehow.&gt; She shrugged and stood to walk back into the 
kitchen. &lt;&#39;Ranma&#39; *is* unusual, though...&gt;

The sound of humming soon drifted into the tearoom, Kasumi&#39;s 
thoughts already on other, more immediate concerns.
