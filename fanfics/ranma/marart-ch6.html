Episode 6:  Cats, Ghouls, and Mousses

Dr. Tofu opened the clinic door and took the package from the
delivery man.

Kasumi:  &quot;What is it, Tofu?&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;A package from China.  I wonder what it could be.&quot;

Kasumi finished cleaning the clinic and came up behind her lover;
slipping an arm around his chest as she pressed against his back.  Dr.
Tofu unwrapped the box and saw a small white cat lying down inside
it.

Kasumi:  [picking up Shampoo]  &quot;Oh, what a cute kitty-cat!  Too bad
        we can&#39;t take her home.&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;Hmmm?  Why not?&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Ranma and Ranko.  They&#39;re scared of cats.  We&#39;ll just have
        to leave it here until we find a home for it.&quot;

Ranma, Ranko, Akane, and Ukyo entered the clinic.  Kasumi quickly
put Shampoo back in the box and placed the box on top of one of the
cabinets.  Shampoo looked through the airholes in the box at the
scene below; she didn&#39;t want to reveal herself too soon.

Ukyo:  &quot;Hi, Kasumi!  Hi, Dr. Tofu!&quot;
Kasumi:  &quot;Hi, Kyoko.  I&#39;ll see you at home, dear.&quot;

Kasumi kissed Dr. Tofu on the cheek and left with the others while
Ranko stayed behind.  Dr. Tofu led her to an examination table and
sat down next to her.

Dr. Tofu:  &quot;What did your mother want you to talk to me about,
        Ranko?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Mom thinks I&#39;ve been too depressed lately.&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;Have you been?  I haven&#39;t noticed.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;ve seen me only during lovemaking
        lately, I guess.  It makes me happy.  For a little while at
        least.&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;So what&#39;s wrong.&quot;
Ranko:  [looking down at her hands] &quot;I miss Ryoga.  He hasn&#39;t come
        back yet.&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;But you knew about his misdirection before you even met
        him.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I told him about Shampoo.  I miss her too.&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;Do you think he loves you enough to love Shampoo?  Do
        you think Shampoo will love him?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;Do you love both of them?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I do.  I love Shampoo and I love Ryoga.&quot;

Dr. Tofu reached his arm around to hold Ranko, who rests her head
against his shoulder as tears started to fill her eyes.  Ranko felt a
calmness radiating out from him that she also experienced while
being held by Kasumi or her mother.

Ranko:  [closing her eyes]  &quot;I wish they were here.&quot;
Dr. Tofu:  &quot;If they love you, they&#39;ll come back.  And if they don&#39;t,
        well, you can always go off to look for them.&quot;

Shampoo looked down at her one-time lover.  She had been confused
at their intimate encounter, and shamed at returning to her village
having failed to fulfill the promise of the &quot;kiss of death&quot;.  It was only
a result of the proof of the truth of the cursed pools and her insistence
that both Ranma and Ranko were both male and female that
prevented her from being banished.  They had sent her back to find
out which twin was really the male and marry him, or kill the sister,
though she had known that it was Ranma and not Ranko.

But it was Ranko she was in love with, or thought she loved, and
Ranko was crying over her.  If she had been banished, Shampoo had
known that she would have made her way back to Japan and Ranko. 
Shampoo crept out of the box and jumped onto Ranko&#39;s head.  Ranko
ran off into the streets with Shampoo clutching the back of her head. 
Dr. Tofu sighed and locked the clinic behind him.

***************

Ranko caught up to the others at the Tendo Dojo, running into
Ranma and causing them both to stick together in hysterics.  They
eventually made their way to the bath and fell into the hot water,
turning Shampoo back to her human form.  The others ran into the
house to catch up.  Everyone came through the broken bathroom door
to see the naked chinese girl in the bath with Ranko and Ranma.

Soun:  &quot;Wah!  My poor baby Akane is betrayed!&quot;

Soun&#39;s head seemed to grow until it filled the room.

***************

Everyone sat around the dinner table as Shampoo explained how she
had been sent back to Japan by her village elders to either marry
Ranma or kill Ranko.  Ranma and Ranko were suddenly doused by
cold water as Cologne came flying into the room.

Cologne:  &quot;So, it appears that Shampoo told the truth about you two.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Grrr...&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Grrr...&quot;

Ranma and Ranko attacked Cologne, angry at having their curse
exposed in front of Ukyo.  While they are able to dodge some of her
blows, Cologne shortly gains the upper hand against the twins and
knocks them into the pond.

Cologne:  &quot;Hmmf.  Not bad.&quot;
Ranma and Ranko:  &quot;Old bag.&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;She is great-grandmother.&quot;
Cologne:  &quot;Come along, Shampoo.  We must decide what you are to
        do.&quot;

Shampoo meekly followed Cologne to the Cat Cafe.

***************

Ukyo:  &quot;How horrible!  And neither of you can be cured unless the
        other one dies?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;That&#39;s what that guide said.&quot;

Ukyo watched in amazement as the twins turned back to their
original forms.  She could see why no one at school knew about their
curses; they wore the same type of clothes, and were almost identical
twins when they were the same sex.

She felt sorry for them; it certainly made their lives more
complicated, especially given how little it took to change their bodies. 
Certainly Ranma had been lucky in that Akane had accepted the
curse so easily, and she wondered if she would have done the same if
she had stayed with Ranma since she last saw him.  Ukyo felt a
twinge of sympathy; their lives had not been the carefree and joyful
lives that she had assumed they had.

At the same time, from the perspective of her Marital Arts training,
Ukyo was intrigued.  She wondered if the change had any effect on
their sexuality, if Ranma could now bear children, if either of them
were sexually active in both their forms.  She had wondered how it
felt for the male to achieve orgasm and how it was different from her
own orgasms.  Now there was a girl and boy that would be able to
compare the two.

Ukyo promised to not to reveal their secret, and they smiled at her. 
She almost returned to the happy memories she had when they first
met; the friendship that suddenly turned to love, even though they
were so young.  Akane got up and she returned to the present.

Akane:  &quot;Would you like to join me in the practice hall?&quot;

***************

Ukyo closed the sliding door to her room.  It was still quite bare, only
a small table that doubled as a desk, a cabinet for her clothes, and her
futon.  Nabiki had said that if she wanted anything more, she should
let her know, but life on the road had taught her to live without what
most people consider &quot;essential&quot;.

It had been a year since she finished her Marital Arts training with
her mother and first set out to find Ranma.  Ukyo had been
humiliated when Nodoka had brought her back to her parents, and
though she brought back the family&#39;s yatai, the gossip of the
neighborhood children had haunted her throughout her childhood.

She had taken to studying the Okonomiyaki style of martial arts, and
had planned to repay Ranma by beating him until he knew the pain
she had felt while growing up.  But when she reached puberty her
mother offered her another option:  to learn the tricks of her Marital
Arts school and lure him away from his other fiancee, then dump him
so that he was alone in the world, unable to return to his old life.

Unbeknownst to her father, she had learned the arts of pleasure.  She
was still technically a virgin; no man had yet entered her body,
though her hymen had long since been torn away.  She had tracked
the Saotomes, transferring between schools so that she could resume
her life once she achieved her goal, but missed them just before they
left for China; she then went to their home and waited for their
return, at that time she disguised herself by enrolling at an all-boys
school.

She had been busy with discouraging a transvestite homosexual, so
she missed the Saotome&#39;s first move to the Tendo Dojo.  Luckily, the
family came back to stay for a month.  When she eavesdropped and
found how long they were going to stay, she decided to take the time
to lose her admirer for good.  She then followed the families back to
Nerima, and when she spotted the ad in the paper she thought that it
must have been a sign that her wish for revenge would finally be
fulfilled.

Ukyo now realized that she wouldn&#39;t have been able to go through
with her initial plan for Ranma; both he and Ranko were better and
faster fighters than she was.  Akane was roughly her equal, though
Ukyo hadn&#39;t used any of her Okonomiyaki Special Techniques during
their sparring match so she couldn&#39;t be sure.  She had told them
something about her past; about how her fiance had abandoned her
and how she came from Osaka (no sense in hiding that - they could
have figured it out from her accent) looking for an explanation.  It
was the truth, though not completely true.  She never mentioned
anyone&#39;s name and she didn&#39;t think that they&#39;d mention it to Nodoka.

Ukyo also started to realize that taking the job had been a mistake. 
She found herself liking Akane, and got along well with Ranko,
Ranma, and the others.  When the time came, she&#39;d just have to
harden her heart to them and go through with her plan.

***************

Ranma and Akane saw the sign on Nabiki&#39;s door (Studying!  Do not
disturb!) as they made their way to their room.  Since Ukyo&#39;s arrival
they had stopped their &quot;study sessions&quot; together so that nothing
would appear out of the ordinary (for the Tendos or Saotomes).

Ranma:  &quot;I could have told you that the two of you were evenly
        matched.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Like I&#39;d believe you.  How&#39;d you know that?&quot;

Ranma took out the futon as Akane undressed.

Ranma:  &quot;I watched her practice the day she moved in.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Oh, getting tired of me already?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t... I mean...&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I know, Ranma.  I was just teasing.  Now hurry up and take
        off your clothes.&quot;

Akane slipped into the futon as Ranma stripped down to his boxers. 
She held the covers up until he joined her, then they both lay on their
backs as Ranma slipped his arm around her.  Akane loved the feeling
of his body against hers.

Ranma:  &quot;Still, there&#39;s something about her...&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Like what?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I have the strangest feeling around her.  Its almost like
        we&#39;ve met before.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Maybe you did.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Hmm?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Well, your dad took you all over the country, right?  Maybe
        you did meet her.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I guess its possible.  Why did you three take so long in the
        furo?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;We were talking.  Girl stuff.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;About what?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;About this.&quot;  [touching Ranma&#39;s manhood through his
        boxers]  &quot;And others like it at school.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Oh.&quot;

***************

Shampoo entered Ranko&#39;s room through the window.  She suppressed
the memory of the last time she had done this.  Ranko was already
sleeping in the bed.  Shampoo crept closer.

Ranko&#39;s brain sensed the approach of danger and woke her up.  Her
other senses identified her visitor.

Ranko:  &quot;Are you here to kill me, Shampoo?&quot;

Shampoo dropped the bonbori from her hand.  She couldn&#39;t go
through with killing her one-time lover, no matter her great-
grandmother&#39;s decision.  Ranko lifted the sheets, inviting Shampoo to
join her in the bed.  The faint street light outlined Ranko&#39;s almost
nude body and the scent of Ranko&#39;s arousal filled the room.

Ranko:  &quot;When you came back I hoped you&#39;d return here.  I
        fantasized about what we&#39;d do tonight if you did.&quot;

Ranko sat up and took Shampoo&#39;s hand in her own.  Shampoo sat
down next to Ranko, not looking at her.

Ranko:  &quot;I missed you so much.&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;Shampoo want... Shampoo want family.  Shampoo want
        strong man for husband.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Do you want me?&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;Shampoo want...&quot;

Ranko laid down on the bed and slipped back under the sheets.  She
slipped a hand onto Shampoo&#39;s shoulder and guided her down to lie
next to her own body, covering the both of them with the warm
blankets, letting her arm rest on Shampoo&#39;s side.

Ranko:  &quot;I&#39;ve found a strong man.&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;Ranko betray Shampoo?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I&#39;ve found a man to love.  I want... I wish the three of us
        could be...&quot;

Shampoo thought back to Dr. Tofu&#39;s office.  Ranko had mentioned
loving Ryoga.  It had to be the same boy that she traveled to Japan
with when she first arrived.  He wasn&#39;t bad looking, but...

Shampoo:  &quot;Stupid boy.  Ryoga get lost on the in-stroke.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Oh no, he doesn&#39;t...&quot;

Ranko trailed her hand down to Shampoo&#39;s thigh and slipped under
the short dress, eventually making her way to Shampoo&#39;s panties. 
Shampoo let Ranko&#39;s hand complete its journey as she listened.

Ranko:  &quot;He&#39;s shy, and so awkward its cute, but he doesn&#39;t get lost in
        lovemaking.  I took his hand in mine and brought it down,
        showing him the way around a woman&#39;s triangle.&quot;

Ranko ran her hand through Shampoo&#39;s pussy hair, her fingers
lightly touching the outer lips, not letting herself go any further for
the moment.

Ranko:  &quot;And I told him how good he made me feel and then allowed
        him to open me up.  He slipped one of his fingers into my
        pussy.&quot;

Marital Arts 6 - Part 2

Ranko continued to draw her finger along Shampoo&#39;s outer lips,
teasing her with her touch.  Shampoo brought a hand up to her
breast, touching it through her dress, drawing the fabric across her
stiffening nipples.

Ranko:  &quot;Then I lay back and told him to come closer.  And he
        opened me up and started to use his tongue on me.&quot;

Ranko slipped a finger into Shampoo, who shuddered and gasped at
the penetration.  Shampoo&#39;s wetness already coated her insides and
now started to spread over Ranko&#39;s hand as she added another finger,
and then another.

Ranko:  &quot;Then I told him about my clit and he touched it lightly.&quot;

Ranko brought her finger to Shampoo&#39;s clit and Shampoo orgasmed. 
Ranko smiled at her lover&#39;s release and brought her hand up to her
mouth, letting herself taste the coating on her fingers.  She next
brought her hand to Shampoo&#39;s mouth, giving her a taste of her
pleasure.

Ranko:  &quot;I want you to stay with me.  I want you, Shampoo.&quot;

Shampoo suckled at Ranko&#39;s fingers as she recovered.  Ranko&#39;s other
hand wormed its way under Shampoo to make its own way to her
damp sex.  Shampoo lost Ranko&#39;s fingers at her mouth and could feel
the bedsheet slowly slip from her body as Ranko made her way down
her back.  Shampoo rolled onto her back as she felt Ranko between
her thighs, starting to roll her panties down her legs.

Shampoo suddenly jumped up!  She knew how to avoid fulfilling the
&quot;kiss of death&quot;!

***************

Ranma and Akane were surprised when the door to their room burst
open, but not completely so.  Shampoo rushed in, dragging Ranko (in
panties) behind her.

Shampoo:  &quot;Shampoo solve problem!  Here!&quot;

While the others wondered where she kept the knife, Shampoo
quickly poked herself in the finger and watched as the drop of blood
pooled on the skin.  She put the finger to Ranko&#39;s mouth, then to
Ranma&#39;s.

Shampoo:  &quot;Shampoo make Ranko and Ranma blood villagers!  Then
        no have to kill or marry!&quot;
Cologne:  &quot;Very clever, Shampoo.&quot;

Ranko turned on the room light.  Ranma and Akane jumped back as
their blanket suddenly flew into the air.  Underneath was Shampoo&#39;s
great-grandmother, balancing on her staff.

Ranma:  &quot;What were you doing there, you ghoul?&quot;
Cologne:  &quot;Shut up, boy.&quot;  [whacks Ranma with her staff]  &quot;If you are
        truly blood villagers you must show respect for your elders.&quot;

Cologne looked at the four young children.  She knew something was
wrong; she could feel it.  Being almost a hundred and fifty, and not
being stupid, she was able to figure out what it was.  These children
were too accustomed to nudity, to each other, much more so than
could be allowed even for siblings.  Shampoo had never been self-
conscious, but the others...

Cologne didn&#39;t really object to Shampoo&#39;s act.  She could sense the
potential in the two Saotome children.  If they were now part of the
village they came under her jurisdiction as an amazon elder.  She
looked around the room.  It was obvious that the boy, Ranma, and his
lover Akane had not been involved in lovemaking that night, but
Shampoo clearly had been.  That left Ranko to be Shampoo&#39;s lover,
something that Shampoo had not revealed to her previously.

Cologne wasn&#39;t bothered much by Shampoo&#39;s homosexuality; such
unions were not uncommon among the villagers, though they were
seldom admitted to publicly to the children.  When the souls of the
villagers were reincarnated, it became almost impossible to deny a
love that spanned centuries, no matter the sex of those involved.  She
herself, when she was young, had journeyed to Japan in search of a
thief and...

Cologne suddenly looked closer at Ranko.  She had gotten a feeling
of deja vu from the girl and her mother earlier in the day, but now
she suspected...

Cologne:  &quot;Go to your mother and show her this.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;What?  Why?  I&#39;m not your slave!&quot;

Cologne took out a necklace from under her shirt and gave it to
Ranko before hitting her out the door.

***************

Ranko briefly considered going back to fight Cologne, but her
curiosity got the better of her.  What was so important about the
locket?  She opened it on her way to her room, but saw only two
small paintings, one on each side, of two beautiful young women.

As she dressed in one of her chinese tops and went to her parents
room, she figured that one of them must have been Cologne when she
was young (however long ago that was), and the other must have
something to do with her mother.  She listened at the door, but didn&#39;t
hear anything, so she knocked and went in.

Nodoka held out her hand and Ranko put the necklace with the locket
in it.  As Nodoka looked at it she pulled out a locket from her
kimono.  It was identical to the first.  She quickly turned off the
surveillance monitor and rearranged the room so that Genma
wouldn&#39;t find anything out of the ordinary when he finished his shogi
game with Soun.

***************

Nodoka:  &quot;Bring Kasumi, Tofu, and Nabiki to Ranma and Akane&#39;s
        room.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;But...&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;No buts.  This is important.&quot;

Ranko was mystified.  She didn&#39;t understand why the locket seemed
so important to her mother, but she did as she asked.  Nodoka entered
Ranma and Akane&#39;s room.

Cologne:  &quot;And how is your Marital Arts School, child?&quot;

***************

Nodoka struggled to remember the stories her grandmother passed
down to her, especially those about the locket.  Long ago, before her
grandmother&#39;s time and even before that, there had been her family&#39;s
practitioners of the Marital Arts schools.  One of her ancestors had
been challenged to a duel in front of a foreign girlfriend; upon
defeating her challenger and killing him (not for the duel - for the
indiscretion of revealing the secret in front of a innocent) she was
unable to kill the girl.  That had been the origin of the locket; in
exchange for her silence on the matter it would mark a debt to be
paid.

Nodoka:  &quot;You are the heir to this locket?&quot;
Cologne:  &quot;It is mine.&quot;  [takes back the locket]
Nodoka:  [surprised] &quot;That would make you... Cologne-chan, the
        chinese party girl?&quot;
Cologne:  &quot;I am.&quot;

Everyone except Cologne, Nodoka, and Shampoo fell to the floor at
the suggestion that Cologne could at one time have been a &#39;party girl&#39;.

Nodoka:  &quot;What do we need to do to fulfill the vow?&quot;
Cologne:  &quot;Train my great-granddaughter in the marital arts.&quot;

Cologne left out the other &#39;greats&#39; that connected her to Shampoo. 
Nodoka smiled; she had not expected things to be so simple. 
Normally, that request would have been outside the bounds of even
the debt, but Nodoka knew of Ranko&#39;s feelings for the girl.  Given
Ranko&#39;s stubbornness and her love for Shampoo, she doubted if she&#39;d
just let Shampoo leave once the training had been completed.

Nodoka:  &quot;I would accept, except that I believe my daughter&#39;s the one
        to take up the burden.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Really?&quot;

Cologne frowned.  She suspected the feelings that Shampoo had for
the red-haired girl, but she wanted to spread the secrets of marital
arts to her amazon sisters as soon as possible.  Reincarnation meant
having to wait two or three generations before the knowledge would
be gained for the whole village.  But Cologne saw Ranko and
Shampoo look at each other and she relented; she remembered what
it was like to be in Shampoo&#39;s situation, though it had been a long
time ago.

Nodoka:  &quot;But.&quot;  [everyone paid attention]  &quot;Shampoo can not stay
        here.&quot;
Cologne:  &quot;I accept.&quot;

Cologne instantly realized that this would allow her to keep most of
her influence over Shampoo.  Technically, she was bending the laws
of the village, but the rewards far outweighed the risk.

Ranko:  &quot;Mom!&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;No, Ranko.  On this point I must remain firm.  Shampoo&#39;s
        presence here can only lead to rumors that could destroy the
        dojo and possibly our school.  I cannot allow that.  Ranma
        and Akane are &#39;married&#39;.  Tofu and Kasumi are engaged. 
        What excuse are you going to use with Shampoo?&quot;

Ranko became quiet as she could not argue against her mother&#39;s
point.  Cologne suddenly used her staff to touch Ranma and Ranko in
the chest.

Ranma and Ranko:  &quot;Hey!&quot;
Cologne:  [chuckling]  &quot;Just a little insurance to remind that you are
        blood villagers.  Come, Shampoo, we must return to the
        restaurant.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I want her to stay.&quot;

Ranko took Shampoo&#39;s hand, glaring at Cologne.  Cologne knew that
Ranko&#39;s independent nature was causing her to rebel against her, but
also knew that Shampoo would follow her orders if it came down to
that.  And she knew that everyone in the room knew it as well.

Cologne:  &quot;I see no harm in letting her stay, as long as her training
        starts tonight.&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;Aiya!  Thank you, great-grandmother!&quot;

Shampoo hugged Cologne and watched as she hopped off to their
new home.

***************

Nodoka returned to her own room.  Turning on the monitor, she saw
what was happening upstairs and started to record the encounter for
later comment.  When she started to hear Genma and Soun finish
their shogi game, she again replaced everything into its hidden state;
once she finished she opened her locket and looked at it.

Inside were two paintings, not of Cologne and her ancestor, but of
herself and Kimiko.  Nodoka sadly smiled at her departed lover. 
Genma walked into the room looking a little depressed and sat down
on the floor.

Nodoka:  &quot;What&#39;s the matter, dearest?&quot;
Genma:  &quot;I lost the shogi match to Soun.&quot;
Nodoka:  &quot;Well,&quot; [taking out their futon] &quot;there are other things to
        win at.&quot;
Genma:  &quot;Are there?&quot;

Genma looked at his wife.  Nodoka took a long time in setting up
their bed, crawling around on all fours to make sure each corner was
straightened out.  Genma watched his wife&#39;s ass as it swayed with her
every movement.

Nodoka:  &quot;You always win with me.&quot;

Nodoka smiled as Genma crawled behind her and started to fondle
her buttock.  His touch, as always, excited her.  Nodoka turned
around and started to undress him.  Their children were not the only
ones in love.

***************

Nabiki got up to leave.

Ranko:  &quot;Do you have to go, Nabiki?  I thought I&#39;d... introduce
        Shampoo to everyone.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;I have tests tomorrow, Ranko.  Maybe tomorrow night.&quot;

Nabiki kissed Ranko on the lips and smiled at her.  She then kissed a
surprised Shampoo on the lips as well, and left for her own room. 
Ranko noted that of those remaining, Kasumi was in a nightgown,
Ranma and Akane were in their underwear and covered by Ranma&#39;s
chinese tops, and Dr. Tofu was in a robe.  Shampoo was the only one
still in &quot;normal&quot; clothes, even though she wasn&#39;t wearing much more
than herself.

Akane:  &quot;We hadn&#39;t planned on anything tonight, but...&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;But if Shampoo&#39;s so important to you, we can make an
        exception.&quot;

Ranma was still a little uncomfortable with the idea of having
another man in the room while he was making love.  Dr. Tofu also
looked uncomfortable, but both soon forgot it by concentrating on
Shampoo.  Ranko held Shampoo&#39;s hand in her own.  Shampoo
wondered what she had gotten herself into; her grandmother hadn&#39;t
explained anything about this &#39;marital arts&#39; to her.

Ranko:  &quot;This is my lover, Shampoo.&quot;  [to Shampoo] &quot;Who do you
        want first?&quot;

Shampoo started at the question.  It seemed as if Ranko was saying...

Ranko:  [whispering] &quot;This is what it means to be my lover. 
        Sometimes.  Sometimes it&#39;ll be just me.  But tonight, we will
        all share.  Which one do you want first?  Ranma?  Tofu? 
        Akane?  Kasumi?  Me?  All of us?&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;Really?&quot;

Shampoo looked at the other women.  They returned her gaze
reassuringly.  Shampoo blushed.

Shampoo:  &quot;Can Shampoo have... can Shampoo have Ranko and
        Ranma?&quot;

Akane smiled.  With their curse, it would be like making love to the
same person in both forms at the same time, which was how she felt
the first time she was between them.  She squeezed Ranma&#39;s hand
and walked over to her sister and Dr. Tofu.  Akane felt a strange
calmness; she knew that Shampoo wasn&#39;t in love with Ranma and she
wasn&#39;t jealous.

Kasumi:  &quot;Why don&#39;t we do the tower today?  You go first, Akane.&quot;
Ranko:  [turning around]  &quot;The tower!  What a great idea, Kasumi. 
        Shampoo, you&#39;ll have to go first.&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;What Shampoo do?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Just watch Akane.&quot;

Shampoo watched as Akane sat down in front of Dr. Tofu, then as
Kasumi came up to sit behind her sister.  She found herself returning
to an aroused state as Kasumi reached around to play with Akane&#39;s
breasts and trail kisses across her back as she removed the top from
her sister&#39;s body.  Shampoo suddenly felt Ranko doing the same to
her after she lifted Shampoo&#39;s dress off her body.

Shampoo closed her eyes and concentrated on the Ranko&#39;s hands
pinching her nipples.  She could feel Ranko&#39;s breasts flatten against
her back, the nipples poking at her skin through the fabric of her
shirt.  She felt Ranma&#39;s hands slip in to cup his sister&#39;s tits.

Ranko slipped her hand down to Shampoo&#39;s pussy and slipped a
finger inside.  She then signaled Ranma and turned around so that
Shampoo was between the twins.  Nearby, Ranko could see Dr. Tofu
sitting cross-legged and Akane descending onto his manhood. 
Ranma was also sitting cross-legged and Ranko guided Shampoo to
sit in his lap as she slipped Shampoo&#39;s panties off.  Shampoo saw that
the others were already undressed.

Shampoo looked down the front of her body as Ranma&#39;s spear
approached her opening.  She saw the tip touch the space between
Ranko&#39;s fingers holding her open; then he started to slowly invade
her body.  Shampoo was glad Ranko controlled her rate of descent as
she lost control of her legs.  She didn&#39;t know what she would have felt
if she had been forced to accept his cock all at once.

Shampoo:  &quot;Ooh, Shampoo like...&quot;



Marital Arts 6 - Part 3

Ranko and Ranma:  &quot;Are you ready?&quot;

Shampoo felt her body moving, letting Ranma withdraw from her
pussy, then letting him back in until he could go no further.  Ranko
knelt behind her to play with her breasts and clit.  Ranma&#39;s hands
were on her ass and controlled the tempo of their joining as their
tongues played and touched and entwined.  Her hips were under his
control, and she felt her insides part for his invading member.

Shampoo quickly orgasmed and the tempo slowed somewhat as she
recovered.  She was somewhat surprised to find that Ranma had not
orgasmed, that he was still erect within her.  She started to get up to
let Ranko have her turn, but found that neither twin would let her
move farther than Ranma&#39;s cock.  Ranma started to speed up the
tempo of his thrusts.

Shampoo then understood that her lovers wanted her to follow their
lead, so she let herself go.  Shampoo ran her hands across Ranma&#39;s
chest, savoring the hardness of his muscles, then reached around
Ranma&#39;s neck and run through his hair.  Ranko continued to play
with her clit, exciting her and causing even more wetness to flow
from her body, lubricating the joystick within her and running down
it to the floor.

Shampoo started to cum for a second time, and still neither twin
would stop.  If Shampoo could have torn her attention away from her
own tryst, she would have noticed Akane also reaching an orgasm
with Dr. Tofu.  The invader that she had once feared continued to
push apart her inner walls, opening her wider than any finger ever
did, its friction driving the heat within her, building up again and
again.

As Shampoo orgasmed again the sound of her impacts could be heard
and Ranko knew it was time for the next step.  Ranko suddenly
grabbed Shampoo&#39;s waist and lifted her body, taking her place on
Ranma&#39;s manhood.  Shampoo instinctively wrapped her legs around
Ranma&#39;s chest and back as she found herself sandwiched even closer
than before.

Ranma&#39;s tongue was at her breasts and Shampoo continued to run her
hands through his hair.  Ranma&#39;s arms went down to clasp Ranko&#39;s
back; he would have to hold the three of them together.  Ranko let
herself quickly get into a rhythm of impaling herself on her brother&#39;s
manhood, the lubrication from Shampoo&#39;s pussy easily allowed her to
slip onto him and she started to release her own honey onto her
brother.

Ranko&#39;s left hand reached up around Shampoo&#39;s leg to sneak onto
Shampoo clit; her right came up from below to slip two fingers into
Shampoo&#39;s empty pussy.  Ranko&#39;s brought her head to press onto
Shampoo&#39;s lower back as she started to finger-fuck her lover.

Shampoo had already lost track of the passage of time; she had only
been able to concentrate on the touches between herself and the twins
after her second orgasm.  She felt Ranko&#39;s voice against her back and
knew that her lover was cumming; she was not long in following, the
pussy muscles that had been contracting around the brother&#39;s cock
now squeezing the sister&#39;s fingers.  Shampoo almost started to slip,
but the pressure of the twin&#39;s bodies wouldn&#39;t allow it.

Ranko orgasmed again as she continued to pump her fingers into
Shampoo&#39;s eager pussy.  She thought that one more orgasm for her
would be enough, so she gave Ranma a signal squeeze with her legs,
and eagerly accepted his harder thrusts into her body.  Soon both she
and Shampoo were cumming again, except this time the trio slowed
down and let Shampoo slip down Ranma&#39;s chest.

Shampoo moved to stand, but found that her legs wouldn&#39;t support
her at first.  Ranko slipped off of Ranma&#39;s still erect manhood, and
fell to the floor giggling as Shampoo landed on her.  Shampoo
watched as the other trio reached their orgasm and started to slow
down as well.  Ranma and Ranko stood next to her and took her
hands in their own.  Shampoo looked down in disbelief as she saw
Ranma&#39;s erection jutting from his body.

Shampoo:  &quot;Shampoo do Ranma with mouth?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Shh... that&#39;s a lesson for another night.&quot;

Shampoo looked at Ranko and noticed her covered with a sheen of
sweat, then saw that Ranma and the others, as well as herself, also
glistened from the lovemaking, smiling their love for each other. 
Ranko squeezed her hand and led her to Dr. Tofu as Akane and
Kasumi made their way to Ranma.  Shampoo saw that Dr. Tofu, like
Ranma, also had his erection.  Ranko touched Dr. Tofu and lay him
on his back.

Shampoo:  &quot;What?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I asked... if you wanted the tongue or the cock.&quot;

Shampoo watched as Ranko lowered herself onto Dr. Tofu&#39;s mouth
and pulled her to straddle Dr. Tofu.  Shampoo wondered what she
was getting into, but wanted it anyway.  She felt Ranko kiss her and
pull at her nipples.  Shampoo lowered herself onto Dr. Tofu and
returned the favor.  Across from them, Shampoo could see Akane
grinding her pussy onto Ranma&#39;s mouth, and Kasumi, her hair
flowing down her back and sticking to the sweaty skin, as she took up
the same position as Shampoo.  She happily wondered what would be
next.

***************

Nabiki&#39;s walkman clicked off as it reached the end of its tape.  Nabiki
continued to sleep, not noticing any of the sounds coming from her
sister&#39;s room for the rest of the night.

***************

Ranma played on the soccer field while Akane and Ranko were on
the school track.  Shampoo was due to arrive soon; it was Nodoka&#39;s
plan to divert suspicion from Ranko by having Shampoo seem to
chase after Ranma.  Since Kodachi Kuno had already attempted to
break up Ranma&#39;s &#39;marriage&#39;, having another girl try it wouldn&#39;t seem
so far fetched.

Shampoo rode from the Cat Cafe on her delivery bicycle.  She didn&#39;t
exactly like being in the restaurant business, but there wasn&#39;t that
much else her family could do in Japan.  She was a little tired from
her activities the previous night, but she wouldn&#39;t take it back for
anything.  She pressed a little harder against the bicycle seat as she
remembered the feeling of waking up surrounded by the others&#39; warm
bodies.

Shampoo jumped the bike over the school wall and landed in the
soccer field.  The students appreciated the shortness of her dress.

Shampoo:   &quot;Nihao, Ranma!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Shampoo?&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;Hurry and ask me to marry you!&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;Shampoo!  Oh, Shampoo!&quot;

A boy with long black hair landed next to Ranma and Shampoo, then
hugged Ranma.  The other students gagged.  Ranma kicked Mousse
in the head.

Ranma:  &quot;Who are you calling &#39;Shampoo&#39;?&quot;
Mousse:  [looking at Ranma with his glasses on, then hits him away] 
        &quot;Who are you?!&quot;

Mousse hugged Akane.

Mousse:  &quot;Shampoo!&quot;
Ranma:  [landing on Mousse&#39;s head]  &quot;Who are you calling
        &#39;Shampoo&#39;?!&quot;
Akane:  [hitting Mousse away]  &quot;Who are you anyway?&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;I am Mousse.  I am the man who is to be Shampoo&#39;s
        groom.&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;What you talking about?  We only friends from child
        times.&quot;
Cologne:  &quot;Mousse!  Weren&#39;t you spurned by Shampoo?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;The ghoul!&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;But that was when we were only three!&quot;
Cologne:  &quot;Age makes no difference!  This man is to be Shampoo&#39;s
        groom!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Not if you ask me, I&#39;m not!&quot;
Soun:  &quot;Ranma is married to Akane!&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Daddy, please!&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;You have a wife, and yet you and Shampoo...&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Now listen for a...&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;The blow of the Swan-Fist!&quot;

Mousse hit Ranma into the wall.

Ranma:  &quot;Why you blind...&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;Ranma!  Be careful!  Mousse is master of hidden
        weapon!&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;I am indeed.  Just as it is impossible to see the swan&#39;s feet
        thrashing beneath the water, so it is impossible to see what&#39;s
        in my hands!!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Impossible?  Ha!&quot;

Ranma trapped Mousse&#39;s weapon with his feet as Mousse attacked
him.  It is a toilet-training potty.  Ranma threw it to the ground.

Ranma:  &quot;That does it!&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;Then you will fight?  These are my terms!  If I should
        win...&quot;
Cologne:  &quot;You can&#39;t have Shampoo.&quot;
Mousse:  [pointing at Akane] &quot;Then I will take your woman!&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Now wait just a...&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;You got it!  The fight is on!&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Ranma!&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;I have your pledge as a man?&quot;

Cologne decided to test her new pupils by completing the Cat-Tongue
technique.  Mousse was good.  Nowhere near her class, but still a
good fighter.

***************

Akane stayed mad at Ranma, not talking to him until lunch.

Akane:  &quot;Ranma!  How could you?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually going to go with him if I lose,
        do you?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;What?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;I said you&#39;re not actually going to go with him, are you?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Of course not!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Then why are you angry?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be agreeing to such things!&quot;

Ukyo watched the exchange with interest.  She thought that perhaps
she might be able to challenge Akane for Ranma according to the
rules of Marital Arts matches (if she failed to lure him away), and
given that Akane would have no training of her own, she would
easily win.

But from what she understood of their conversation, neither of them
would abide by any such agreement.  She decided to spy on them that
night.  Perhaps there was something sexual that Akane wouldn&#39;t do
for Ranma that she would; she could use that to drive them apart.

***************

Cologne threw cold water onto Ranma, changing him to his cursed
form.  The classroom exploded as everyone saw Ranma change into
Ranko&#39;s identical twin.  Cologne quickly touched a spot on Ranma&#39;s
chest, completing the Cat-Tongue Shiatsu technique she started the
day before.

Ranma:  &quot;Hey!  You old bat!&quot;

Cologne ignored him and just as quickly doused Ranko and
completed the technique on her body.  The class again burst into
murmurs as they saw Ranko change into Ranma.  The twins got mad
and attacked Cologne, but she easily deflected their attacks.  Unable
to get to her, the twins went to their bags to get their hot water
bottles, but once they poured the hot water onto themselves it was like
they were being burned.  They immediately went to the water
fountain to cool off.

Cologne explained about the Cat-Tongue, then hopped off, laughing
to herself.  The twins returned to their classroom, not wanting to
explain what just happened to their classmates.

***************

Ranma wasn&#39;t exactly sure how it was accomplished, but a small
fighting ring was erected by the end of the school day.  Ranko walked
to the ring to watch the match.

Mousse:  &quot;So Saotome!  You have come!&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Not me, you idiot!  My brother Ranma!&quot;

Mousse attacked Ranko.  Ranko avoided his attack and kicked him in
the head.  Mousse got up and attacked her again.  Ranko avoided his
second attack and stepped into close range, hitting him with a flurry
of punches to the face and head.  Mousse fell to the ground.

Ranko:  &quot;Stupid jerk!  Attacking a girl!&quot;

The rest of the school, not knowing of the curse, thought they saw
Ranma defeat Mousse and started to leave.  Ranma jumped onto the
ring.

Ranma:  &quot;Where&#39;s Mousse?&quot;

Akane pointed to the ground, where Mousse still lay unconscious. 
Ranma lay down and started to slap him.

Ranma:  &quot;Hey!  Wake up, Mousse!  We&#39;re supposed to fight!&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;Enough!&quot;

Mousse shoved Ranma&#39;s head into the ground.

Mousse:  &quot;Oh no!  I hit a girl!&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;C&#39;mon, Mousse.  Fight!&quot;

Ranma chased Mousse around the ring.  Mousse couldn&#39;t see using
his hidden weapons on a girl, but he eventually decided to fight. 
Ranma attacked, but with Mousse&#39;s longer arm and leg reach it soon
became obvious that he could not defeat him as a girl.

Ranma thought to himself.  He knew that Ranko was able to hold her
own against him when they were in their normal forms, and his reach
was longer than hers then.  What was it about her technique that
allowed her to do that?  They were both trained by the same person.

Ranma blocked a kick and punch from Mousse as he struggled to
figure out how to defeat him.  Ranma realized why Ranko could fight
him to a draw every time they fought; he decided to act on it.

Mousse struck at Ranma, who dodged and grabbed his arm as it
passed over him.  Ranma threw Mousse to the ground but did not let
go of the arm; Ranma leapt into the air and landed on Mousse&#39;s
stomach.  Mousse got up from the ground and Ranma whirled
quickly into his reach; Mousse was too slow and was unable to block
Ranma&#39;s attack.  Ranma used a version of the &quot;Tornado Timber
Punch&quot; on him, extending his arms and spinning in place like a top,
hitting Mousse on every revolution.  Mousse fell to the ground,
unconscious again.

Cologne watched everything, making mental notes of the fight. 
Ranko appeared to be more aggressive and was a little quicker than
Ranma was (to counter his greater strength and longer reach). 
Ranma didn&#39;t seem to realize his female form&#39;s fighting
disadvantages, but he soon recovered from his mistake and adapted to
defeat Mousse.  That probably meant he could unconsciously analyze
the flow of the fight, an invaluable tool when facing an opponent of
superior strength, and which probably meant his sister could do the
same as well.  Cologne appreciated the potential the two presented,
and the challenge of making them her students for real.

***************

Nabiki dumped a bucket of water on the unconscious Mousse.  The
school had long since been deserted of the fight watchers.  Nabiki
could appreciate the way the wet cloth pressed against Mousse&#39;s body. 
Nabiki sat down next to Mousse and introduced herself.

Nabiki:  &quot;Nabiki Tendo.  Ranma&#39;s my brother-in-law.  I believe I can
        help you with your problem.&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;How?&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Meet me outside my home&quot; [gives Mousse the dojo address]
        &quot;tonight, around nine.  Don&#39;t bring any weapons.&quot;

Nabiki explained to Mousse about the Jusenkyo curses.

***************

Nabiki talked to Ukyo as she washed the dinner dishes.

Nabiki:  &quot;How are you doing, Kyoko?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Fine, Nabiki.  Its a little weird around here, but I like it.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Well, I think everything&#39;s going to work out fine with you. 
        I set up your account with the credit union and put in your
        first deposit, so you can start withdrawing from tomorrow.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;That&#39;s great!  Thanks, Nabiki.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Well...&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;What is it?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;What are Ranma and Akane going to do now?  I mean, he
        seems to be stuck in his cursed form...&quot;
Nabiki:  [amused]  &quot;Why don&#39;t you ask them?&quot;

***************

Ukyo knocked at the Akane&#39;s door.  Akane acknowledged her and she
entered the room.

Ukyo:  &quot;Akane...&quot;
Akane:  &quot;What is it, Kyoko?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;I guess... I guess I was wondering how you and Ranma were
        handling... umm... you know...&quot;
Akane:  &quot;You mean Ranma&#39;s curse.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;I guess... I mean, he&#39;s no longer a man now, and he is your
        husband...&quot;
Akane:   &quot;Well, if he wants to do it, I&#39;ll do it with him.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;Even in his girl form?&quot;
Akane:  [nodding] &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter to me.  Or I guess it stopped
        mattering once we got married.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;You mean, you&#39;re going to be... umm... bisexual with him?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Since its Ranma, I will... I suppose I&#39;m a Ranmasexual.&quot;
Ukyo:  [giggling] &quot;I won&#39;t tell anybody.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Thank you, Kyoko.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;I guess... I was just hoping that this wouldn&#39;t cause any
        troubles...&quot;
Akane:  [taking Ukyo&#39;s hand] &quot;Don&#39;t worry about us.  I was angry at
        Ranma earlier, but our relationships stronger than somebody
        trying to take one of us away.&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;I&#39;m so glad the two of you have each other.  And umm...&quot;
Akane:  &quot;What?&quot;
Ukyo:  &quot;I was wondering... umm... what&#39;s it really like to be
        married?&quot;
Akane:  [smiling] &quot;Married?  Or making love?  Are you fantasizing
        about Ranma as well?&quot;

Ukyo blushed as the two of them started to giggle.  Then Akane
started to talk...

***************

Ranko left her door and window unlocked as per Nabiki&#39;s
instructions.  She hoped that Mousse would give up on Shampoo. 
She had nothing against him, but she was Shampoo&#39;s lover, not him.

Shampoo opened the window and entered her room.

Shampoo:  &quot;Ranma?&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;No, its me.&quot;

Ranko drew Shampoo into her embrace.  Shampoo ran her hands
over Ranko&#39;s male form, touching the body that was now so much
like her brother&#39;s.  Ranko kissed Shampoo, then started to undress
her, opening the dress and letting it fall to the floor, then Shampoo&#39;s
panties.

Ranko undressed and Shampoo saw that she was already excited. 
Shampoo looked closely at the nude male body of her lover and
compared it to Ranma&#39;s.  It was identical in almost every respect.

Ranko picked Shampoo up and carried her to her bed, laying her
down gently and opening her to her touch.  Ranko&#39;s head lowered to
Shampoo&#39;s womanhood.  Shampoo&#39;s legs curled around Ranko&#39;s head
as she felt her lover&#39;s tongue&#39;s first touch against her skin.

***************



Marital Arts 6 - Part 4

Mousse stood in front of the Tendo Dojo gate at the designated time. 
He saw a female figure approach and hugged her.

Mousse:  &quot;Shampoo!&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Hmm.  Not quite.&quot;

Nabiki stepped out of Mousse&#39;s embrace.  She had never intended to
help him, at least not in the way he wanted.  She figured that Mousse
would just get hung up on Shampoo and return sometime in the
future, so she decided to show her Ranko and Shampoo making love. 
That way he would see that Shampoo loved someone else, and he
could go on with his life (he also wouldn&#39;t return to cause structural
damage to the house, which happened more often than she liked).

Nabiki quietly led Mousse past the parents and up to Ranko&#39;s door. 
Mousse struggled to avoid ogling her body, but to no avail, especially
when he followed Nabiki up the stairs.  Nabiki was wearing her usual
pair of cut-off shorts and a tank top.  As she walked before him,
Mousse could sometimes catch a glimpse of her breasts bouncing
with every step, and the definition of her legs and ass almost caused
him to get an erection; he struggled to remain focused on Shampoo.

Nabiki had arranged for Shampoo to be here at this time, and for the
tryst to occur.  She listened at the door.  Ranko and Shampoo seemed
to be going at it already.  She smiled to herself.  Normally, she&#39;d join
them rather than just watching, but this was important for the dojo. 
Nabiki silently opened the door a crack and motioned for Mousse to
approach.

Since the room light was on, Mousse had a clear view of the two
lovers.  Shampoo lay beneath Ranko, her legs wrapped around Ranko
as she accepted her lover&#39;s manhood.  Suddenly they switched
positions, and Shampoo straddled Ranko, moving rapidly as Ranko&#39;s
hands massaged her breasts.

Shampoo&#39;s hair flung about wildly as her head moved from side to
side in abandon.  Shampoo moaned out Ranko&#39;s name as she
orgasmed.  Mousse&#39;s heart sank as he realized how far he was from
Shampoo&#39;s heart.  Mousse watched as Shampoo turned around on
Ranko&#39;s manhood, facing away from her lover&#39;s body but continuing
the joining with enthusiasm.  Shampoo&#39;s back arched until she lay
almost on top of Ranko, Ranko&#39;s hands reaching up to run over
Shampoo&#39;s nipples, as her breasts flattened against her body. 
Shampoo&#39;s long, purple hair fell onto Ranko&#39;s face.

Nabiki looked at the mountain in Mousse&#39;s outfit with appreciation. 
Mousse&#39;s attention was totally on the two in the room, so she knelt
down and pulled the front over her head.  Nabiki deftly released the
drawstring to Mousse&#39;s pants and touched the enlarged member. 
Mousse gulped.

Mousse&#39;s hands found the door frame as he sought to steady himself. 
Wanting to move, but not wanting Nabiki to stop her blowjob,
Mousse found himself trapped watching Shampoo being brought to
orgasm again.  He watched as Shampoo got on her hands and knees,
then as Ranko came up behind her and entered her that way. 
Shampoo, it seemed, was intent on trying to go through as many
positions as Ranko could provide her.

Nabiki kissed the cock in front of her, then again and again.  She
decided not to use any of her special techniques; she&#39;d only use them
on her family and the man she&#39;d know she&#39;d marry, whomever she
discovered that person to be.  Still, she felt Mousse shudder when she
extended her tongue and ran it over the tip of his cock.  A drop of
clear fluid almost magically appeared after that.  Nabiki touched it
with her tongue as her hand made its way down to her shorts.

Mousse watched as Ranko grabbed Shampoo&#39;s waist and plunged her
manhood deep within Shampoo.  Shampoo lost control of one of her
arms and her body twisted so that he could see her front; fascinated,
he watched as the breasts bounced with each impact from Ranko.  He
heard Shampoo announce her impending explosion and that proved
too much for him.  He erupted into Nabiki&#39;s mouth.

Nabiki swallowed all of Mousse&#39;s ejaculation, then replaced his
manhood back into his pants and retied the drawstring.  She slipped
from underneath his outfit, then slowly stood before him, leading him
away from the door as Ranko sandwiched Shampoo with the wall.

Nabiki:  &quot;Now, I know that getting over Shampoo is not something
        you can do overnight, but...&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;But...&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Shhh.  Let me finish before I lose my nerve.  I find you
        attractive.  I want to start something with you.  I don&#39;t want
        marriage or an engagement... yet.  I think you&#39;re discrete
        which is why I&#39;m making you this offer.  If you find me
        attractive, then keep your glasses on and follow me to my
        bed.  I&#39;ll be waiting.&quot;

Mousse watched as Nabiki walked away from him to her bedroom,
leaving the door open for him.  He looked back at Shampoo, who was
moaning her encouragement as Ranko lifted her against the wall so
that her pussy was at Ranko&#39;s face and her legs traveled across
Ranko&#39;s shoulders and down Ranko&#39;s back.

Mousse made sure his glasses were on.

***************

Ukyo came out of Akane&#39;s room as the door to Nabiki&#39;s room closed. 
They had talked about boys, and Ranma, and her &#39;fiance&#39;, whom she
described as Ranma with a few changes.  Ukyo thought she heard
noises coming from Ranko&#39;s room and decided to investigate.

Ukyo gasped at what she saw.  It seemed Ranma was fucking
Shampoo!  Ukyo stared in disbelief as she realized that it was Ranko
and not Ranma.  She gaped at the sight of Ranko&#39;s nude male body. 
Was Ranma her physical equal?

Ranko lowered Shampoo so that she could penetrate her again. 
Shampoo squealed in delight as Ranko&#39;s cock slipped back within
her.  Shampoo soon moaned loudly as she approached her orgasm. 
When she at last reached it, Ranko became stiff as she also reached
started to cum, shooting her hot liquid into her lover.  Ukyo shut the
door as the two sank to the floor, tenderly kissing each other in the
afterglow.

Ukyo ran into Ranma on the way down the stairs and blushed at the
memory of Ranko&#39;s male body.  She quickly made her way to her
room to reclaim her wits.  Was her old friend a lesbian?  Surely not,
as the way she talked about Ryoga indicated.  So she must be
bisexual.  Ukyo closed her eyes and the image of Ranko and Shampoo
returned.  Ukyo started to change clothes for her spying session on
Ranma and Akane, and looked down at her panties as she slipped off
her long pants.  She was wet.

Ukyo took off her top and her bra, but she knew she was in trouble
when she smelled the scent of her own excitement drift up from her
crotch.  She pulled the wet panties from her body.  There was no way
she could go out like this - her scent would give her away.  Using her
pants, she started to dry herself of her honey.

Ukyo didn&#39;t make it out of her room that night.

***************

The desk lamp was the only source of light, but Mousse could clearly
make out Nabiki lying in the bed, holding the bedsheets to cover her
chest.  Mousse looked down at the floor and saw the clothes that she
wore just a few minutes before; at a gesture from Nabiki, he rapidly
rid himself of his own.  Nabiki pursed her lips as she gained her first
full view of Mousse&#39;s body.  Returning the favor, she dropped the
bedsheet from her hands and moved forward so that she lay fully
exposed on the bed.

Nabiki:  [stretching] &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to join me in bed?&quot;

Mousse stumbled forward.  He had dreamt of this moment, but
always with Shampoo.  Nabiki smiled at him and reached to take his
manhood into her hand, still a little sticky from her saliva but not too
much so.  Mousse stiffened at the touch.  Nabiki drew her hand back
and forth along its length, watching it grow to its full length.  She
then lay back on her bed, wrapped her legs around Mousse&#39;s torso,
and pulled him down to her.   Nabiki spread her legs wide in
anticipation of his entry.

Nabiki:  [whispering huskily] &quot;I&#39;m already wet.  Just go for it.&quot;

If Ranma had been there he would have shrugged and just noted that
it was Nabiki&#39;s preferred style of lovemaking, which was lucky for
Mousse, because he didn&#39;t know of much else.  Mousse positioned
himself at her opening and slowly moved forward.  Nabiki took hold
of his manhood and guided him into her.  Mousse lost his balance
and fell forward, burying himself to the base of his cock.

Nabiki murmured her encouragement as Mousse recovered his
senses.  All of his dreaming couldn&#39;t compare to the actual feeling of
being surrounded by a woman&#39;s sex.  Nabiki told him to move and he
started to withdraw from her body; using a visual technique she
learned from Nodoka, she imagined she could feel her inner walls
coming together in the wake of his passage.  Then as he was about to
disconnect himself Nabiki tightened her legs that were wrapped
around his ass and he started to return into her.

Nabiki:  &quot;Yes... like that... only harder and faster.&quot;

Mousse awkwardly complied at first, but became proficient as their
joining continued.  He drove himself into her with every stroke,
burying himself in her moistness.  Nabiki loved the feeling of being
driven into her mattress.

Mousse&#39;s glasses start to slip off his head.  He started to push them
back onto his nose, intent on watching the passionate girl beneath
him respond eagerly to his every touch.  Nabiki&#39;s hands reached out
to grab her bedposts.

Nabiki:  &quot;Lift me up.  Lift me up!&quot;

Mousse instinctively knew what to do as Nabiki arched her back off
the bed.  Grabbing her hips, he lifted her body as he went to his
knees.  Nabiki lay suspended in mid-air as Mousse continued to
thrust into her.  Mousse watched as Nabiki&#39;s tits shook back and
forth; watched as Nabiki&#39;s body twisted from side to side in ecstasy. 
He grabbed onto her legs, trying to keep the sweaty, slippery body off
the bed.

Mousse couldn&#39;t help himself; he was ready to explode.  In
desperation he warned Nabiki.  Nabiki&#39;s left hand released the
bedpost and her body twisted and fell to the bed.  As soon as Nabiki
ran her finger over her clit, her body shook with the force of her
orgasm.  Mousse released himself into Nabiki&#39;s pussy and fell on top
of her body, exhausted at his effort.

Still joined, both lovers caught their breath.  Nabiki reached up to
take Mousse&#39;s glasses off and put them on the table next to her bed.

Nabiki:  &quot;You won&#39;t need these for awhile.&quot;
Mousse:  [softly laughing] &quot;I guess I won&#39;t.&quot;

Mousse laid his head in the valley between Nabiki&#39;s breasts.  In
wonder, he brought his hand up and touched the tip of the nipple,
then ran his fingers down the breast until he cupped it in his palm. 
Nabiki sighed.

***************

Ranko and Shampoo lay on their sides on the bed, facing each other. 
Ranko&#39;s hand moved lazily up and down Shampoo&#39;s side, rippling the
sheets with its passage as she told Shampoo about the Cat-Tongue. 
And about her wishes for the future.

Shampoo:  &quot;Ryoga as good as Ranko or Ranma?&quot;
Ranko:  [laughing lightly] &quot;Not quite.  But he could be, with a little...
        training.&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;But Shampoo want strong man only.&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;Well, he&#39;s not going to force you.  He&#39;s not that kind of man. 
        And I&#39;m not going to force you into a threesome with him. 
        But... I do love him.  And I love you.  I want us to be
        together.&quot;
Shampoo:  &quot;Shampoo don&#39;t know.  Shampoo love Ranko, but...&quot;
Ranko:  &quot;I know.&quot;

Ranko kissed Shampoo, then pulled her lover into her embrace as
they drifted off to sleep.

***************

Akane started to take out their futon after Ranma entered the room.

Ranma:  &quot;Say, do you think Kyoko suspects something?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;What makes you say that?&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Well, I just passed her on the stairs, and she looked at me
        and blushed.  I mean, really, really red.&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I could be behind that.&quot;

Akane smiled as Ranma frowned at her.

Ranma:  &quot;What were you talking about?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;About boys again... and what&#39;s its like to sleep with one.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;You didn&#39;t... not about me?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Well, she&#39;s not going to tell anyone.  I trust her.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Even so...&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Besides, she a friend.  She asked about us now that you&#39;re
        stuck...&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;And what did you say?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I told her that once I married you, I didn&#39;t care what form
        you were in, because its you.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;And she wasn&#39;t shocked or disgusted?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;Maybe a little.  But not too much.&quot;

Ranma and Akane noticed the sounds of passion coming from
Nabiki&#39;s room.  Ranma and Akane undressed for bed.

Ranma:  &quot;Who&#39;s that with Nabiki?
Akane:  &quot;I think its Mousse.&quot;
Ranma:  [slipping under the covers] &quot;Mousse?  Nabiki wants
        Mousse?  That jerk?&quot;
Akane:  [joining Ranma] &quot;He&#39;s not so bad.  And I think Nabiki&#39;s been
        looking for someone of her own.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;Is Nabiki really serious about him?&quot;
Akane:  &quot;I know she didn&#39;t plan it to end this way tonight, but maybe
        she really is.&quot;
Ranma:  &quot;So how are we supposed to get some sleep?&quot;

Akane smiled and pulled out two sets of earphones.

***************

Mousse woke to find himself still at Nabiki&#39;s breast, her hand idly
playing with his hair as she watched her new lover through the night. 
At Mousse&#39;s movements, Nabiki smiled at him.  He really couldn&#39;t see
it without his glasses, but he felt her move against him seductively. 
Nabiki reached over to get his glasses and placed them on his head. 
Mousse looked at her; realizing for the first time how beautiful she
was to him.

Mousse:  &quot;Umm... I&#39;ve got to... where&#39;s the bathroom?&quot;

Nabiki told him the location of the upstairs bathroom, reminding him
to be careful, even though it was now early morning.

Mousse:  &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;I know you will.&quot;  [smiling] &quot;You&#39;re clothes are still here. 
        And I...&quot;  [taking his hand and running it over her body]
        &quot;will be waiting for your return.&quot;

With her other hand she touched Mousse&#39;s body and it instantly
responded.  Pulling Mousse out of bed, she guided him to the door
and kissed him before he left.  He carefully made his way to the
bathroom, being careful to move silently.

Mousse thought to himself as he lifted the seat and started to use the
bathroom.  He was almost scared of Nabiki; she overwhelmed him
with her sensuality and drive, but she seemed to really want him.  He
got the feeling that if he wished it, tonight would be nothing more
than a one-night stand for the both of them, but she was prepared to
give him more than that if he wanted it.

Mousse was confused.  He wasn&#39;t sure who he wanted anymore. 
There was Shampoo, but she was in love with another girl.  There
was Nabiki, but could he give up on Shampoo for her?  Mousse
started on his way back to Nabiki&#39;s room.  From out of the shadows
Cologne hit him on the head and sent him to the ground.

Cologne:  &quot;I see that you&#39;ve started something with the unattached
        Tendo girl, Mousse.  Good.  As your village elder I am
        ordering you to learn all of their Marital Arts techniques. 
        To that end, you are to court her.  But first, you are to leave
        tomorrow morning for the village and hand the council of
        elders this note...&quot;  [gives Mousse a small envelope]
        &quot;explaining our situation here.  Do not fail, Mousse.&quot;

Cologne hopped away.  Mousse got up and rubbed the back of his
head.  Nabiki rushed out, still as naked as he was, and led him back
to her room.

Mousse:  &quot;I guess... I guess you heard what she said.&quot;
Nabiki:  [nodding] &quot;I won&#39;t do it.  Not what she wants.  That I will
        only do for my husband and my children.  Do you
        understand, Mousse?&quot;

Mousse did, and gained a small measure of respect for the girl in
front of him.  She might not be a martial artist, but she had her own
iron will and her own sense of honor.  He didn&#39;t quite understand
what Cologne was talking about when she mentioned &#39;marital arts&#39;,
but Nabiki stopped him before he could ask.

Nabiki:  &quot;I can&#39;t explain it.  If I did, I might have to kill you, and I
        couldn&#39;t bear to do that right now.&quot;

Mousse looked in disbelief as Nabiki.  The sense of threat he got from
her was real!

Nabiki:  &quot;Just say you&#39;ll come back to me.&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;I... I&#39;ll come back.&quot;

Nabiki kissed Mousse, and he felt like he should protect her because
she seemed so vulnerable, so different from the girl that was before
him just a moment ago.  Then the feeling passed as she took the
envelope from his hand and let it fall to the floor.  Nabiki kicked the
clothes aside and brought Mousse to lie on his back.  Nabiki&#39;s hand
went to his cock, raising it up for another round of pleasure.  Mousse
looked in disbelief as he realized the sexual hunger the girl had; but
he started to realize that he could match that hunger with his own. 
He reached up and brought Nabiki down to kiss him.

Nabiki:  &quot;I guess we&#39;d better say good-bye, then...&quot;
Mousse:  &quot;Not until morning...&quot;
Nabiki:  &quot;Good.  I&#39;ll take that as a promise.&quot;
