<h1>Female Fiancees' Fun</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/weinberg.html">Sebastian Weinberg</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was early morning and Ukyou was busy in the back of the 
&quot;Ucchan&#39;s&quot; restaurant when a knock came at the door. 

&quot;We&#39;re closed,&quot; called Ukyou, &quot;Please come back later.&quot; 

&quot;Ukyou, please! Let me in; I need your help.&quot; 

Ukyou frowned. That voice... Oh, yes, that was Akane&#39;s voice. 
What would she want Ukyou&#39;s help for, of all things? 

Outside, Akane shifted from one foot to the other. The door 
half opened and Ukyou peered out. 

&quot;Akane, what is it?&quot; 

&quot;Ukyou!&quot; Akane was relieved. &quot;Please let me in. I have a 
problem.&quot; 

Ukyou hesitated for a moment, but then decided that Akane 
wouldn&#39;t come to her if it wasn&#39;t something really important. 
So she opened the door completely and stepped aside for Akane 
who rushed in and closed the door hurriedly. She seemed a 
little out of breath. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; asked Ukyou 

Akane leaned against the door with her back. &quot;Shampoo 
attacked this morning. She tried some kind of &#39;passion spice&#39; 
again.&quot; 

&quot;Uh oh! And Ran-chan is...&quot; 

&quot;No, he&#39;s fine... I ingested the stuff!&quot; 

Ukyou&#39;s hand flew to her mouth. &quot;Oh dear! And now you&#39;re in 
love with Ran-chan? Or someone else?&quot; 

Akane blushed. &quot;Err, It was apparently more of a &#39;lust&#39; 
herb...&quot; 

She grabbed Ukyou&#39;s hands. &quot;Ukyou, I&#39;m getting hornier by the 
minute! You&#39;ve got to hold me back when I lose all control!&quot; 

Ukyou freed her hand and scratched her head. &quot;I guess I could 
help you, but why did you come to me?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re the only girl I know with enough fighting experience 
to stop me if I try anything... stupid. And I obviously 
couldn&#39;t ask a boy.&quot; 

Ukyou covered her mouth again. &quot;Eeep, no! Of course.&quot; She 
frowned for a moment thinking, then said &quot;Akane, I&#39;ve got to 
open in half an hour and Konatsu will be here soon. I could 
put you into the storage room. It has got strong walls and 
can be locked. That way I can keep an eye on you while doing 
business.&quot; 

Akane nodded in acknowledgement. &quot;But you&#39;d better keep me in 
there. We both have an interest to keep me away from Ranma in 
this state.&quot; 

Ukyou hadn&#39;t thought of it that way. Now that Akane had 
mentioned it, she would make sure that Akane wouldn&#39;t escape. 

The store room was a chamber with stone walls that contained 
crates and sacks of ingredients for Ukyou&#39;s okonomyaki. The 
door had a bar and padlock on the outside. Ukyou smiled when 
they went in. She saw Akane take note of the bar. 

&quot;It&#39;s almost as if it was built to imprison people, eh?&quot; 

Akane laughed nervously. &quot;It&#39;d better be.&quot; Her breathing was 
ragged already. &quot;Thanks for doing this for me, Ukyou.&quot; 

&quot;I believe in fair play. And I think you&#39;d do the same for me.&quot; 

She smiled and went out, locking the door. 

&lt;And you were quite right when you said we both have an interest 
in keeping you away from Ran-chan&gt;, she thought. 

Ukyou continued preparing the restaurant for today&#39;s business, 
all the time listening for escape attempts from Akane. But the 
storage room was quiet. 

Konatsu arrived and the two opened &quot;Ucchan&#39;s&quot; for business. 

&lt;This is going over easily enough&gt;, Ukyou thought standing 
behind her griddle preparing the ordered okonomyaki for the 
customers. Exactly in that moment she heard a noise from the 
back. It sounded like a crate falling over. 

&lt;I should have known that nothing is ever this easy&gt;, she 
thought and grabbed her fighting spatula on the way back. 

She peeped in through the small window in the door and saw 
what had happened. Akane was lying on the floor, her skirt 
hitched up and her panties removed. She was frantically 
masturbating, her fingers making wet noises that Ukyou 
could hear by the door. Behind Akane was the crate that 
Ukyou had heard fall, lying on its side. Apparently Akane 
had rested against it and pushed it over in the throes of 
passion. 

Ukyou shook her head. &lt;Oh my! That stuff is pretty potent. Is 
that Shampoo insane? If Ranma had eaten what Akane did, there 
would be no stopping him.&gt; She wrenched her eyes from the erotic 
sight Akane was displaying and went back to work. 

Back in front again Ukyou made sure that there was always 
something sizzling on the grill to cover up any moans escaping 
from the back room. 

~*~ 

Everything went well for the next three hours. Ukyou regularly 
checked on Akane, hoping that the effect would let up soon, but 
there was no sign of it. She had to admire Akane&#39;s energy and 
acrobatic prowess, though. &lt;I&#39;m beginning to see what Ranma 
sees in her - she is cute, sexy even, when she allows herself 
to let go...&gt; 

It was after these three hours that Konatsu approached her. 

&quot;Ukyou-sama, we seem to be out of flour and the yakisoba are 
running out, too. I&#39;ll go get more from the storage room, shall 
I?&quot; 

Ukyou&#39;s gaze jerked up from the grill. She had only been half 
listening until the last sentence alarmed her. 

&quot;No! Err, I mean: you wait on the customers - I&#39;ll get the 
flour.&quot; 

Konatsu shrugged. He was used to hard work, but If Ukyou 
wanted it this way... 

&lt;Idiot&gt;, Ukyou scolded herself. &lt;Should have thought of checking 
whether we need something from the store room before I put her 
in.&gt; 

She looked in through the window. Akane was almost completely 
naked now and covered in sweat. She was still masturbating 
with what appeared to be a wooden dildo. &lt;Where did she get 
that?&gt; Ukyou wondered. 

Carefully, her eyes on the moaning and pumping Akane, Ukyou 
opened the door. There was no reaction from Akane, who seemed 
to be absorbed with what she did. Ukyou silently went over to 
the flour sacks. 

On her way there she found out where Akane&#39;s wooden helper 
came from. &lt;The broom! She has snapped the rounded end off 
the broomstick. This looks like it was cut - she did that 
with her hands?!&gt; She looked over to the mewling and moaning 
Akane. &lt;No wonder she wanted someone with fighting experience 
to guard her.&gt; 

She picked up a sack of flour and sneaked past Akane to the door. 

Suddenly She heard a rush, tried to turn, but it was too late. 

Akane glomped on to her with frightening speed and power. 
Ukyou&#39;s arms were pinned to her side and the sack of flour 
went flying off towards the door. It hit, and the door slammed 
shut. Both could hear the door locking with a click. 

&quot;Akane, let go!&quot; 

&quot;Not right now.&quot; Akane had locked Ukyou in an embrace from 
behind, her head resting on Ukyou&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Ukyou struggled to break free, but with 
her arms pinned she couldn&#39;t get the leverage. 

&quot;I can&#39;t go on like this. I need someone to help me...&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll see if I can get someone - but you&#39;ve got to let me go.&quot; 

&quot;I think you don&#39;t understand what I mean.&quot; whispered Akane. 

Ukyou&#39;s eyes widened when she felt Akane&#39;s tongue touching the 
rim of her ear. Akane pressed herself to Ukyou&#39;s back as close 
as possible and continued to trace Ukyou&#39;s ear with the tip of 
her tongue, breathing heavily. 

&quot;Akane! What are you doing.&quot; 

&quot;I won&#39;t let any boy near me while I&#39;m like this. But I still 
need someone to hold...&quot; 

&quot;And you suggest I take that place? No way!&quot; 

&quot;If you don&#39;t help me now, I&#39;ll knock you out and go for Ranma. 
Do you think that anything could prevent our marriage if we meet 
while I&#39;m in this state? I&#39;m serious.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s Blackmail!&quot; Ukyou knew that Akane was right. If Ranma 
met her now, there was no way he wouldn&#39;t end up having sex 
with Akane. And then their parents would have a handle to force 
them into marriage with lightning speed. 

&quot;I know it&#39;s blackmail,&quot; said Akane who had begun kissing Ukyou&#39;s 
cheek and neck, &quot;But If I don&#39;t get relief soon, I&#39;ll go insane.&quot; 

&quot;What?!&quot; Ukyou turned her head around to face Akane. &quot;You mean 
you didn&#39;t come yet?&quot; 

Akane tried to kiss Ukyou on the lips, but Ukyou turned away 
again. Akane sighed. 

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t. I think under the influence of this herb it&#39;s 
impossible to reach orgasm on your own.&quot; 

Ukyou sagged. &quot;All right. I promise to help you - but no tricks, 
you hear me?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, thank you!&quot; Akane exclaimed. She spun Ukyou around and 
embraced her again from the front before she could clear her 
head. This time Ukyou&#39;s arms were free, though. 

For a moment Ukyou considered striking Akane over the head to 
render her unconscious, but then she noticed something. 

Akane was sobbing. 

She wasn&#39;t sure whether it was relief or something else that 
prompted Akane to quietly cry on her shoulder, but in that 
moment it was clear to Ukyou that she would help Akane. &lt;I 
promised her. I can&#39;t let her down now. She needs my help.&gt; 

Slowly, a little unsure what to do, Ukyou embraced Akane back 
and then began stroking the girl&#39;s short hair. 

After a while Akane stopped her silent sobs and just held Ukyou 
close to her. When Ukyou felt Akane&#39;s arms loosening she pulled 
out and held Akane before her. 

Akane sniffled a bit and her cheeks were wet. &quot;You are really 
going to help me?&quot; 

Ukyou smiled at her. &quot;Yes. We will make something comfortable 
for you to lie down on from the wheat sacks here and then we&#39;ll
get this out of your system.&quot; 

Akane raced over to the wheat sacks and began pulling them to the 
middle of the room where Ukyou arranged them into something 
resembling a mattress. When they were done Akane lay down on 
them and Ukyou brandished the makeshift dildo. Akane shivered 
in anticipation and spread her legs wide. 

Ukyou cowered down between Akane&#39;s thighs and eyed her vagina 
closely as she brought the ersatz penis close to it. She 
started by stroking the wood along Akane&#39;s thighs which made 
the girl moan loudly. 

&quot;Gee, Akane, you worked yourself quite thoroughly.&quot; observed 
Ukyou at the sight of Akane&#39;s blood-engorged outer lips that 
were already spread wide open in anticipation of the intruder. 

&quot;Uh-huh&quot;, nodded Akane open-mouthed, humping her hips up 
against the dildo when Ukyou finished a stroking motion at 
the inner edge of Akane&#39;s left thigh. &quot;I&#39;m ready, Ukyou! Put 
it in already. Don&#39;t tease me; I&#39;m horny enough as it is.&quot; 

&quot;You are,&quot; said Ukyou when she spread Akane&#39;s petals further 
with the index and middle finger of her left. The wetness 
dripping from the girls sex could not be overlooked. 

Slowly she brought the rounded tip of the broomstick end 
towards Akane&#39;s entrance and pushed it against the opening. 
Akane reached down and in one smooth motion pushed it inside 
herself. Ukyou was a little shocked, but began pumping it in 
and out now. 

&quot;See, I told you -Aaah- that I was ready. Aaahh. I had it in 
me -Yes!- when you came here, didn&#39;t I? Yes, like that!&quot; 

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s not as if I do this every day. I wanted to make 
sure I don&#39;t hurt you.&quot; 

Akane raised her head and grinned at Ukyou. &quot;Do you mean to 
imply -Unnh- that I do this every day?&quot; 

Ukyou grinned back. &quot;Hey, what do I know? You live under one 
roof with Ran-chan - everything is possible.&quot; 

&quot;Ooooh! That reminds me -Yes!- we&#39;d better learn -Aaah- learn 
something from this. Do that again! Yes! We will need it if one 
of us -Aaah- is to marry Ranma!&quot; 

Ukyou froze for a moment. &quot;I never thought about it that way...&quot; 

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t stop! Aaah, thanks! Ahhh! I mean it. That boy -Nnnh- 
is a cold water magnet! Nnnng! I&#39;d bet he would manage -Aaah- to 
get splashed on the wedding night right -Yes!- right before 
climax.&quot; 

Ukyou giggled. &quot;That would put a damper on things, I can imagine&quot; 

&quot;Unless of course -mmmm- one has this little -oooh- little 
helper handy by the be- bedside.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s my broom! I mean was.&quot; 

&quot;Heh, if you need it -Yay!- need it that much -mmmm- then keep 
it. We have our o- own brooms at the dojo.&quot; 

&quot;Why, make fun of me, will you?&quot; teased Ukyou. &quot;I could stop 
this, you know.&quot; 

&quot;No! No, please don&#39;t stop.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I just have to rest my arm for a moment. I&#39;ll 
continue with my left.&quot; Ukyou changed hands on the handle and 
resumed pumping the moaning and humping Akane with her left. 

Her right hand was completely wet from Akane&#39;s gushing fluids 
and she wiped it off at the front of her tunic. As the cloth 
went taut over her breasts she noticed that both her nipples 
were erect and sensitive. The sight of the horny Akane writhing 
before her begging to be done turned her on, Ukyou realized, 
and her breasts were reacting. 

That gave Ukyou a new idea. She turned the attention of her 
now free right hand to Akane&#39;s breasts that Akane was busy 
kneading and pressing. Ukyou lightly pinched Akane&#39;s left 
nipple and Akane howled! 

Ukyou smiled at the reaction and changed her position to 
kneeling at Akane&#39;s left side so that she could continue 
pumping the dildo in and out of Akane while gaining easier 
access to her swollen, sensitive breasts. 

Akane lost the power of speech for the next few minutes, 
until she finally reached out and halted Ukyou&#39;s pumping arm. 

&quot;Let... let me change... positions&quot; 

With a sucking noise the wooden prick slid out of Akane and 
she turned over onto her stomach. While Akane hoisted herself 
onto all fours and turned so that her open sex pointed towards 
Ukyou, Ukyou herself mused over her own feelings. 

There was no denying the fact hat she enjoyed what they were 
doing. Her nipples were fully erect, her panties rather wet a
nd she caught herself being envious of Akane for hogging the 
wooden erection. 

She sighed and went to work on Akane again. She was surprised 
to see that the broomstick end went in quite a bit deeper from 
this position. 

For ten minutes all that Akane uttered were unintelligible 
moans, sighs and purrs. Then she gasped &quot;This is so good! I 
needed that all along, but I just couldn&#39;t reach it on my own. 
I needed someone to touch me, someone I could hold.&quot; She slid 
away from the dildo in Ukyou&#39;s grasp and turned. &quot;Please, 
Ukyou. Let me hold you.&quot; 

&quot;But... but... I can&#39;t go on with this,&quot; she waved the wood, 
&quot;if you hold me.&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t need to.&quot; supplied Akane. &quot;Just lie down on me and 
put your leg between my thighs&quot; 

&quot;You are certainly inventive.&quot; grinned Ukyou as she put the 
broom end away and complied with Akane&#39;s wishes. 

She lay down on the other girl&#39;s athletic body - breast to 
breast, hip to hip - and parted her legs, letting one slide 
down between Akane&#39;s gaping thighs. Immediately Akane began 
humping up her pelvis, rubbing the furrow of her sex along 
the cloth of Ukyou&#39;s trousered leg. 

As Akane began to gasp at the feelings the cloth evoked from 
the bud of her clitoris, Ukyou couldn&#39;t help but notice that 
her own arousal was being furthered by this position, too. 
Akane had instinctively raised her leg beneath Ukyou&#39;s vagina 
and Ukyou could feel it through her panties each time Akane 
humped up to meet her hips. Also the fact that both their 
breasts were grinding against each other&#39;s was doing its share 
do make Ukyou&#39;s breathing ragged. 

Akane was whimpering and mewling, her eyes closed, her mouth 
open. She couldn&#39;t see that Ukyou&#39;s face tensed, too, and 
didn&#39;t notice that the other girl fell into the rhythm of 
thrusting and grinding hips. 

When finally her climax approached, sending shivers through 
Akane&#39;s body to announce its impending explosion, Akane 
arched her back and pressed Ukyou hard to herself. 

&quot;Oh, Ukyou, I&#39;m... Nnnnnyaaaaaahhh!&quot; 

Her hips shot up and she pressed her crotch against Ukyou&#39;s 
as her juices flowed freely, dripping onto the wheat sacks 
beneath and wetting Ukyou&#39;s already slippery trousers. 

She slumped a little, breathing hard. That was when she 
noticed that Ukyou hadn&#39;t stopped moving. She opened her eyes. 

Ukyou, eyes screwed shut, a look of concentration on her face, 
was still rubbing her crotch up and down Akane&#39;s thigh. Only a 
few moments later a squeal of joy came from her lips as Ukyou, 
too, came. 

Akane smiled and pulled Ukyou down in another embrace. Both 
purred basking in the warm afterglow, united by their shared 
experience. 

Akane stroked Ukyou&#39;s back down to her buttocks which she 
massaged, making Ukyou moan weakly. There she felt the massive 
wet spot soiling Ukyou&#39;s trousers - their combined love fluids. 

&quot;We&#39;d better get you out of these wet clothes.&quot; said Akane. 

Ukyou didn&#39;t move a muscle, but she answered &quot;You haven&#39;t got 
enough yet?&quot; Her speech was a little hampered by the fact that 
her face was buried in Akane&#39;s shoulder. 

Akane stretched underneath Ukyou, making a sound like a cat. 

&quot;I&#39;m still horny as hell. I just don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m about to 
lose my mind anymore.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds bad enough to me.&quot; said Ukyou and pushed herself up to 
look Akane in the face. Her eyes twinkled. &quot;Back to work.&quot; 

~*~ 

When Konatsu came to look for Ukyou and the flour he opened the 
door and found a) a sack of flour right in front of the door and 
b) Ukyou and Akane lying inverted upon each other busily lapping 
at the nectar that was flowing from each other&#39;s flower. He 
silently picked up the flour and went back to the restaurant. 
Ukyou never heard a word from him about it, but she noticed in 
the following weeks that he was cross-dressing and acting female 
with increased fervor again. 

&lt;Strange&gt;, she wondered, &lt;I thought he was finally thinking of 
himself as a man.&gt; 

Ranma never figured out why Akane seemed to blush and get self-
conscious every time she accidentally saw him naked or half-
naked in girl form. 

&lt;She&#39;s been acting this strange for three weeks, now.&gt; he 
thought. &lt;Well, at least she seems to be getting along better 
with Ukyou these days...&gt; 

-------------------------------------------------

As is usual for lemons, I got quite a bit of feedback on this 
one. 

The #1 comment was that The title could be written as F&sup3;, 
which is the title of a lemony-fresh anime, that has no 
other similarity than the alliterative title. Oh well, I 
should have known better than to give in to alliteration. 

Also, a few people asked me, why I didn&#39;t take the lemon 
scene further - it just seemed to be getting interesting. 
The reason is that, despite this being a lemon, I was more 
interested in the impact of the sex on the characters, than 
in the sex itself. My main goal was to show two turning 
points for Ukyou. The first, when she has the chance to 
strike Akane unconscious, but decides not to. She helps 
Akane of her own free will, not because she was blackmailed. 
The second point is at the end of the lemon scene, when 
Ukyou goes from clinically masturbating Akane and receiving 
&quot;accidental&quot; pleasure, to actively participating in the 
giving and taking of pleasure that is called Making Love. 

And finally, someone asked me, if the last sentence meant 
that Akane and Ukyou now had a lesbian relationship. Ooops! 
That&#39;s not what I meant. The sentence meant just what it 
said - Akane and Ukyou are getting along better, because 
of their shared experience. One homosexual encounter does not 
make you homosexual automatically. 

Ukyou just filed the incident under &quot;interesting experience&quot;, 
and that&#39;s that. Akane is on the one hand a bit ashamed of 
what they did (that&#39;s why she&#39;s blushing over the female 
Ranma) but on the other hand, she&#39;s glad that it was Ukyou 
and not some boy - because &quot;With a girl it doesn&#39;t really 
count.&quot; :)
