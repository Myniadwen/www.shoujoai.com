<h1>The Amazon and the Moneylender (part 5 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/thrythlind.html">Thrythlind</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/amamon-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Copycat Ken fiddled with the little vial, laughing quietly. By now Akane should 
have opened his little package and soon, if not already, Ranma would be coming 
for the antidote. It was something he should have thought of long ago. He 
watched the vial twirl through the air one more time and laughed again. Even in 
the event that Ranma beat him, there was no way that he&#39;d figure out how to use 
the antidote correctly. He was probably the only one in the world that knew 
about the substance.

Copycat Ken was happy, there was no way for him to lose now. Ranma Saotome was 
doomed. He caught the vial looked beyond the soccer field&#146;s fence. He saw the 
approaching glow of a large battle chi and smiled again, snickering. He secreted 
the vial away in a pocket somewhere as he walked out onto the soccer field.

He looked around at the small gathering of people at the field, not as many as 
he had hoped for, but more would follow in Ranma&#146;s wake. Everything was going 
his way, and nothing could go wrong.

&quot;How&#146;s Akane doing?&quot; Copycat Ken asked as he heard the fighter land behind him, 
he turned around in time to see the chi surrounded fist flashing towards him. He 
barely ducked the attack and jumped out of range, that wasn&#146;t Ranma&#146;s normal 
method of fighting. It took him less than a second to realize that his opponent 
was not Ranma. &quot;Akane Tendo?&quot; He asked laughing. &quot;I take it this means that you 
didn&#146;t get Ranma&#146;s gift.&quot; The crowd was gossiping among themselves at what 
Akane&#146;s presence meant for the battle.

&quot;I&#146;m going to kill you,&quot; Akane promised from where she stood. Copycat Ken 
laughed as his leap peaked and he began to settle to the ground.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Sayuki muttered. &quot;We missed them again.&quot;

&quot;How do you know that they were ever here?&quot; Yuka asked, a little bored. Sayuri 
pointed to the back of the restaurant, where it curved around out of the girl&#146;s 
immediate line of sight. Yuka walked a few feet to the corner and looked around 
the bend.

&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Yuka commented. The rear wall of the restaurant had a gaping hole 
in the wall. &quot;Where should we try next?&quot; A group of people ran by, moving 
towards Furinkan High School.

&quot;Hey, I want to place a bet,&quot; somebody shouted upon seeing Sayuri and Yuka. 
&quot;Akane to win over Copycat Ken!&quot;

&quot;Akane fighting Copycat Ken!&quot; Sayuri and Yuka shouted together. They joined the 
rush, taking bets along the way as they did.

&quot;Ryouga,&quot; Ukyou said wearily. The bandanna-ed boy stopped his stride and turned 
to face her.

&quot;What?&quot; he asked, honestly curious. Ukyou pointed a little to her left, where 
she stood about three feet behind him. He turned and saw the sign of the Tendo 
dojo.

&quot;We&#146;re here,&quot; she told him.

&quot;Oh, heh,&quot; Ryouga said, embarrassed. &quot;I guess so.&quot; Ukyou rolled her eyes and 
waited for Ryouga to get to her before walking to the door, dragging him along 
by the arm.

&quot;I don&#146;t get lost that easy,&quot; he protested quietly, in some obscure language. 
She glared at him, but since she didn&#146;t understand what he said, that was it.

&quot;HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED?!&quot; the shout rang at just as Ukyou went to knock 
on the door. It was followed by a full Soun Tendo wail. Ryouga and Ukyou glanced 
at each other and then ran into the dojo. Ukyou had to grab Ryouga before he 
rushed into the kitchen, but otherwise they made it fairly easily to the source 
of the wailing.

&quot;What&#146;s going on?&quot; Ryouga demanded as they turned into Ranma&#146;s room.

&quot;We&#146;re ready to help if it&#146;s&#133;&quot; Ukyou stopped when she saw the situation, Ryouga 
stopped only a stride later. She had expected Akane to be the one in trouble, 
instead she saw an unconscious Ranma surrounded by Soun, Genma and Kasumi.

&quot;Wait a minute where&#146;s Akane?&quot; Ukyou would have kicked Ryouga if she hadn&#146;t been 
thinking the same thing.

&quot;Where&#146;s your fiancee, Akane?&quot; Ken asked snidely. He whirled the kerchief past 
his face and stood there in Ranma&#146;s body.

&quot;Where&#146;s the antidote you freak?&quot; Akane demanded, rushing in at Ranma-Ken. Ken 
blocked and dodged the exchange easily. He jumped to the side and laughed 
snidely.

&quot;Let me guess,&quot; Ranma-Ken laughed. &quot;He found the package first, right?&quot; Akane 
growled at him. He smirked and drew out the antidote vial &quot;I don&#146;t seem to need 
this then, do I.&quot; Akane&#146;s eyes widened.

&quot;Give me that,&quot; she shouted. She leaped at him, kicking out with one foot, 
Ranma-Ken dodged to the side.

&quot;Uh, uh,&quot; the doppleganger tsked. &quot;What if I were to drop this?&quot; The smile on 
his face wasn&#146;t anything Akane had ever seen before on Ranma&#146;s face, and hoped 
to never see it again.

&quot;How&#146;s this going to prove your better than Ranma?&quot; Akane asked him.

&quot;Good point, but I don&#146;t really care,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Here, catch.&quot; He turned and 
tossed the vial across the field, with unerring aim straight for the far goal.

&quot;NOOO!!!!!&quot; Akane momentarily ignored Ken as she rushed for the vial, and nearly 
reached it when something smashed into the back of her head and she fell to the 
ground. Akane rolled to her feet almost instantly, but the vial was already out 
of her reach. It was a mere foot from smashing against the goal&#146;s metal frame 
when a blue ribbon snatched from the air.

&quot;Oo-hahahahahahahaha!!!!&quot; They both turned to see Kodachi as she caught the 
retrieved vial. &quot;Something tells me that you&#146;re not my Ranma-Darling.&quot; The 
mildly disturbed gymnast asserted.

&quot;How&#146;d you guess?&quot; Ken asked, eyeing her angrily.

&quot;Saotome, for all his other faults, does not strike women,&quot; Mousse said as he 
landed next to Kodachi. &quot;Need help Akane?&quot;

&quot;This is my fight,&quot; Akane answered. &quot;Just take that anidote to Ranma. I&#146;ll 
handle Ken.&quot; Ranma-Ken laughed.

&quot;You&#146;ll handle me?&quot; the kerchief passed again and in Ranma-Ken&#146;s face was 
another face Akane easily recognized. &quot;Ranma almost lost to this one, how do you 
think you&#146;ll fare?&quot; Akane hesitated, looking at Saffron&#146;s adult form, then she 
smiled viciously and took her stance.

&quot;Akane?&quot; Mousse asked again.

&quot;GO!!!&quot; Akane shouted. Mousse and Kodachi hesitated, and Akane turned to them 
again. &quot;I can handle a fraud like him.&quot; Her aura flared around her as she said 
it. Saffron-Ken laughed and took his own stance.

&quot;As you wish,&quot; Mouse nodded and turned to Kodachi. 

&quot;Good luck, Akane Tendo,&quot; Kodachi declared before laughing and leaping away. 
Mousse followed quickly behind.

&quot;They don&#146;t know how to use it,&quot; Saffron-Ken laughed. &quot;Ranma&#146;s gone, get used to 
it.&quot; Akane growled and rushed forward.

Mousse found Kodachi waiting just beyond the sight of the soccer field.

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Mousse demanded. &quot;This is your chance to win Ranma&#146;s 
heart.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m going,&quot; Kodachi asserted. &quot;But you&#146;re not, Akane is going to lose. You know 
that as well as I, what would Shampoo think of you if you succeeded in defeating 
that crass shape-changer? Surely you must be a great warrior in order to do 
that.&quot;

&quot;I hadn&#146;t thought of it that way, this is a good chance to impress Shampoo,&quot; 
Kodachi winced.

&quot;Just make sure its Ken you&#146;re hitting and not some spectator,&quot; Kodachi sniped.

&quot;Well, try to miz your paralysis powders with that antidote,&quot; Mousse answered 
back. They glared at each other for a moment.

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Kodachi finally said, softly, glare fading to nothing.

&quot;I will.&quot; They stared for a moment longer in awkward silence before splitting up 
to accomplish their separate tasks.

&quot;How could I have missed that,&quot; Nabiki was thinking to herself, as she sat on 
the bench next to Shampoo. The park was oddly deserted for the time of day, but 
Nabiki had purposefully avoided people so she wasn&#146;t sure why. It didn&#146;t weigh 
much on her mind anyway. &quot;How long have they been in town? What else have I 
missed?&quot;

&quot;This sundae very good,&quot; Shampoo said.

&quot;Really?&quot; Nabiki asked, pausing in her thoughts. &quot;Can I try a bite?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Shampoo scooped out a spoonful a directed it toward Nabiki, who leaned 
forward and accepted the ice cream.

&quot;Mmm, that is good,&quot; Nabiki agreed. Her thoughts continued on a different track, 
&quot;I have been distracted recently. I know that, not been paying my affairs the 
proper attention.&quot;

&quot;Where everybody?&quot; Shampoo asked, gesturing about the empty park.

&quot;That&#146;s a good question,&quot; Nabiki noted. She scanned about the park as well and 
stopped on Shampoo&#146;s face. &quot;Hey Shampoo, you got some whipped cream on your 
face.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Shampoo wiped at her mouth a little. &quot;I get it?&quot; She asked after a moment.

&quot;No not yet,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;It started about a month or so ago.&quot; Then she rolled 
her eyes at Shampoo&#146;s attempts to find the evasive spot of whipped cream. &quot;Here, 
just a moment.&quot; She reached forward with a napkin and wiped it away.

&quot;Thank you, Shampoo fine now?&quot; Shampoo asked.

&quot;Yeah, I got i-&quot; Nabiki&#146;s voice cut off as her eyes connected with Shampoo&#146;s 
merely inches away from her face. Her heart raced and her mind went blank as she 
became aware of the blue-haired Amazon&#146;s closeness, the warmth of her body and 
the cheerfulness of her aura. &quot;I&#133;.uh&#133;I&#133;ka&#133;&quot;

&quot;Nihao?&quot; Nabiki blinked. Shampoo&#146;s hand passed in front of Nabiki&#146;s eyes a 
couple of times. &quot;Nabiki okay?&quot;

&quot;Uh, Shampoo, shouldn&#146;t you be getting back to work?&quot; Nabiki asked as she stood 
up suddenly. Shampoo looked confused and then leaped to her feet.

&quot;Aiya! You right, Shampoo late!&quot; She started to run off towards the Cat Caf&eacute;. 
She paused a moment and hugged Nabiki quickly, it was almost becoming a habit 
with her. Nabiki&#146;s breath caught as Shampoo&#146;s arms encircled her. &quot;See you 
later, okay? Bye bye.&quot; Then Shampoo was gone. Nabiki released her breath and 
collapsed to her knees.

&quot;What was that?&quot; Then Kodachi landed on the fountain above her and dashed off 
with a jarring laugh towards Nabiki&#146;s home. Nabiki shoved the other question to 
the back of her mind and immediately followed. &quot;What is she up to?&quot;

Nabiki came home to a rather chaotic mess, which was normal. She entered the 
thick of it without anybody noticing that she was there. Of course, there was no 
telling whether Kasumi noticed her or not, its not like she would behave any 
differently either way.

&quot;This is very convenient for you,&quot; Ryouga pointed out. &quot;Ken poisons Ranma, Akane 
fights Ken, probably loses, and you bring the cure for Ranma.&quot;

&quot;You are saying that I would ally myself with that creature?&quot; Kodachi was livid.

&quot;I think you&#146;re capable of doing anything to get poor ranchan to marry you,&quot; 
Ukyou agreed with Ryouga.

&quot;As if you two are any better,&quot; Kodachi snapped. &quot;Always plotting together.&quot;

&quot;Well, I guess that was true,&quot; Ukyou admitted. &quot;But I never poisoned anyone, 
that&#146;s your game.&quot;

&quot;Plotting? When did we ever plot?&quot; Ryouga was rewarded with a pair of blank 
stares from Ukyou and Kodachi. They blinked almost in unison at him.

&quot;Is he always like this?&quot; Kodachi asked.

&quot;Am I always like what?&quot;

&quot;You have no idea.&quot; Ryouga sweatdropped.

&quot;Shouldn&#146;t you be giving Ranma the antidote?&quot; Kasumi asked mildly.

&quot;Of course, it&#146;s right&#133;&quot; Kodachi searched around. &quot;WHERE&#146;D IT GO!!?!&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t play games girl,&quot; Genma lectured.

&quot;If you&#146;re stalling&#133;&quot; Ukyou twiddled a pair of mini-spatulas.

&quot;I&#146;m not playing games, where&#146;d it go?&quot;

&quot;You mean this?&quot; Nabiki held up the open vial for all to see. &quot;Give me a moment 
to finish mixing it.&quot; She took a small knife a sliced a thin cut alon Ranma&#146;s 
arm, mixxing the blood into the vial.

&quot;Nabiki, you know this drug?&quot; Soun asked her, pausing from his wailing. She had 
closed the vial again and was shaking it up.

&quot;Something mom taught me,&quot; it was Nabiki would say. &quot;This is Copycat Ken&#146;s 
work?&quot; Her eyes narrowed dangerously. &quot;I should have been paying more attention, 
he couldn&#146;t have collected the ingredients for this without somebody giving me 
an alert.&quot; Then she started asking other questions of herself. &quot;What is going on 
with me, I&#146;m making all sorts of mistakes. And, why was I so out of it with 
Shampoo earlier?&quot;

&quot;Excuse me, Nabiki-san,&quot; Kodachi asked sweetly. &quot;But what exactly does this 
chemical do?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Ryouga snickered. &quot;You&#146;re going to get an answer out of her.&quot;

&quot;I saw those big purple eyes and it was like I couldn&#146;t think anymore,&quot; Out loud 
Nabiki responded unconsciously to Kodachi&#146;s question. &quot;You drink it and takes 
your spirit to where ever the spirit of who&#146;s ever blood is mixed with it.&quot; 
Nabiki was oblivious to the various shocked stares that were sent her way.

&quot;Oh is that it?&quot;

&quot;Shampoo is very&#133;.what am I thinking?&quot; then Kodachi snatched the vial from 
Nabiki&#146;s hand. &quot;Hey, what do you think you&#146;re&#133;&quot; Then Kodachi opened the vial. 
&quot;Aahhh!! Wait you don&#146;t know&#133;&quot; The Kodachi drank the vial dry and her eyes 
rolled back as she fell to the ground unconscious. &quot;&#133;what you&#146;re doing.&quot; Nabiki 
sighed.

&quot;That isn&#146;t a good thing I&#146;m guessing?&quot; Genma said.

Saffron-Ken wasn&#146;t having the level of success he had hoped for in facing off 
against Akane. The winged man frowned as he round-housed over Akane&#146;s ducking 
form, and subsequently had to block a flurry of enraged attacks.

&quot;I don&#146;t get.&quot; Mousse thought to himself, watching from a tree nearby. He could 
already tell that Akane had the edge in the battle. &quot;Saffron was beyond any of 
us, only luck brought Saotome victory.&quot;

&quot;Enough playing around!&quot; Saffron-Ken shouted using his wings to carry him out of 
Akane&#146;s immediate range. The collected audience oo-ed and ahh-ed, but did 
nothing else.

&quot;I thought Saffron was supposed to be a lot more powerful than this,&quot; Sayuri 
noted.

&quot;I hope Akane wins,&quot; Yuka said, quietly.

The false phoenix reared back his hands in preparation for an energy blast, he 
looked down in surprise as Akane leapt up toward him. Then through forward 
and&#133;nothing happened.

&quot;She&#146;s not fighting with any more skill than usual,&quot; Mousse commented. &quot;She&#146;s 
channeling an insane amount of battle chi, though, which explains the enhanced 
speed and strength. But why is Ken having so much trouble with the Saffron 
form?&quot;

&quot;What-!?&quot; Akane&#146;s foot, wrapped in battle chi, snapped into his face bringing 
him downward back to earth.

&quot;Have you figured it out yet, Baka!!?&quot; Akane shouted as she landed and smashed 
into the shape-changer. The dazed Saffron-Ken barely managed a half-effective 
defense against Akane&#146;s attacks. &quot;I&#146;m going to kill you Ken, do you get it?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I understand now,&quot; Mousse laughed. &quot;You&#146;d think Ken wouldn&#146;t make such a 
mistake.&quot;

&quot;Saffron was the greatest warrior any of us have ever faced!&quot; He dodged away, 
regrouping and made an attempt to regain the initiative.

&quot;No heat, no blasts,&quot; she caught a punch and twisted his arm, snapping it. &quot;And 
I&#146;m betting no regeneration. You. Never. Were. Anything. But. An. Image.&quot; Every 
word was punctuated with a punch, a kick, and finally a throw. 

&quot;Your chi stays the same!&quot; she shouted, following him. The battered Saffron-Ken, 
managed to roll out of his uncontrolled flight. Akane halted and watched the 
stumbling landing of the fake phoenix. &quot;No phoenix chi, no phoenix power.&quot; She 
stalked forward, still glowing.

&quot;She really is going to kill him,&quot; Mousse realized suddenly. The kerchief came 
out again, and a beaten Ryouga was standing there. &quot;Akane, stop!! You&#146;ve won!&quot;

&quot;I never did know where my limits where,&quot; Ryouga-Ken snickered. &quot;Bakusai 
Tenketsu!&quot; The ground in front of Ryouga-Ken exploded into a cloud of flying 
dirt. When it passed Ken was nowhere to be found.

&quot;Get back here, coward!!&quot; Akane shouted. &quot;You aren&#146;t getting away with this.&quot; 
Mousse landed behind her, grabbed her arms.

&quot;Akane, he&#146;s gone!&quot; the boy shouted. &quot;He&#146;s gone!&quot; Akane shrugged him off and 
punched into the ground.

&quot;I thought you were taking the antidote to Ranma!&quot;

&quot;I came back in case you lost,&quot; Mousse explained. &quot;Kodachi went on ahead, she 
should be there by now.&quot;

&quot;Kodachi is going to bring Ranma the antidote?&quot; she shouted, grabbing the nearly 
blind martial artist

&quot;Akane,&quot; Mousse answered desparately. &quot;you ordered her to.&quot; He sounded more than 
a little bitter. The battle aura faded from Akane as she calmed down.

&quot;You&#146;re right, I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m just a little upset,&quot; Akane said. 

&quot;A little?&quot; Mousse asked himself quietly, he looked to the mini-craters 
pock-marking the field. They had all been produced by Akane&#146;s battle 
aura-enhanced footsteps.

&quot;So much has been happening recently, nothing makes sense. Look at this, usually 
I&#146;m the one in trouble and Ranma saves me!&quot; Her face became determined again. 
&quot;Well, I&#146;m going to be there when he wakes up!&quot; She rushed off towards the dojo, 
running full speed.

&quot;Hey Mousse,&quot; the martial artist looked over after breathing a sigh of relief.
&quot;Kasumi Tendo? Miss Unryuu?&quot; Yuka and Sayuri stared at each other, momentarily 
confused.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Yuka said. &quot;It&#146;s Sayuri and Yuka. You haven&#146;t seen Shampoo and 
Nabiki around have you? We seem to have a lot of news for Nabiki.&quot;

&quot;You are late, Shampoo,&quot; Cologne lectured as Shampoo walked into the store. 
&quot;Where have you been?&quot;

&quot;I training, great-grandmother,&quot; Shampoo, lied. &quot;Lose track of time. Where 
Mousse?&quot;

&quot;He and the Kuno-girl left to follow Akane Tendo.&quot; Shampoo tied the waitress 
apron around her waist.

&quot;They hurt Nabiki-sister?&quot; Shampoo asked, concerned. Cologne eyed her 
granddaughter carefully.

&quot;And you are worried about your rival for Ranma&#146;s affections?&quot;

&quot;Nabiki not like people mess with her family,&quot; Shampoo said. &quot;Other than her any 
way.&quot;

&quot;Have you been with the Tendo girl again,&quot; Cologne asked. Shampoo sweated a 
little.

&quot;Great-grandma say no see Nabiki again,&quot; Shampoo answered.

&quot;I see,&quot; Cologne said. &quot;I may have to speak to the Tendo girl myself. Shampoo, I 
can handle the caf&eacute; for now, perhaps you should see what&#146;s happening at the 
Tendo dojo. I think my son-in-law might be in trouble.&quot;

&quot;Yes great-grandmother,&quot; Shampoo said happily. Cologne was no longer sure that 
her daughter was thinking of Ranma.

Ranma groaned as he saw another world come into focus. He hadn&#146;t yet found a way 
out of this mess. Every world that came up was another disaster. Each time he 
had lost Akane in some way, and virtually any other chance of happiness as well. 
In one dream he&#146;d been stuck as a girl forever, and Akane of course left him. 
Then he was cured, and Akane still left him. His two forms were split twice, 
with Ranma stuck in one or the other. Once Akane chose Ranma&#146;s male form over 
the female, and the other time it was Ranma&#146;s female form over the male. She&#146;d 
been poisoned by Kodachi, killed by Shampoo, Ukyou, and even Akari&#146;s pig! She 
had married Ryouga, Kuno, Sanzenin, Mousse, and the list went on. Ranma had 
ended up in any a number of situations ranging from prison to, he shuddered, 
married to Kodachi. Every new dream was a nightmare waiting to happen, and Ranma 
was by now very tired of it. The individual dreams didn&#146;t effect him much 
anymore, but the idea of being asleep forever was starting to take hold. He half 
wondered if killing himself in this dream would do any good.

&quot;Great, Kodachi again,&quot; he grumbled as he saw the gymnast sort of stumble around 
the corner down the imaginary street. He ended the dream early, not wanting to 
deal with her just at the moment. When next the world reformed he saw two 
Kodachi&#146;s, one of them was the leering psychopath that he had seen in all the 
previous dreams. The other was more like the real Kodachi, which Ranma had to 
admit was much less extreme than the nightmare versions.

&quot;Is this the way you see me?&quot; the &quot;normal&quot; Kodachi asked dryly.

&quot;Who are you, woman, that you dare to mock the noble beauty of I the Black Rose 
of St. Hebereke?&quot; the psychotic Kodachi shouted, hissingly. The dream world 
fluctuated suddenly and the psychotic Kodachi vanished with a wailing shriek. 
Ranma arched an eyebrow, this was different.

&quot;Okay, so what&#146;s the game this time?&quot; Ranma demanded. &quot;Poison Akane, slip some 
sort of love potion in her soup, have her family sent to debtor&#146;s prison?&quot; The 
scenery began to solidify as Kodachi&#146;s less protected mind began to vent a 
variety of worries that lay in the back of her head.

&quot;Whatever are you talking about?&quot; Kodachi demanded. &quot;I&#146;m here to rescue you, my 
beloved.&quot;

&quot;Rescue me&#133;yeah, I believe that&#133;sure&#133;&quot;

&quot;Well, well, Saotome and the lady Kuno,&quot; both turned to face a demonically 
leering Copycat Ken. &quot;I guess the noble bitch delivered the antidote after all.&quot; 
Ranma was confused, so far there was nothing directly related to his problems.

&quot;But Mousse stayed to fight you,&quot; Kodachi stammered in denial. 

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Ranma muttered.

&quot;Yes, he did,&quot; Ken agreed. &quot;Did you think either he or the Tendo girl could 
actually stop me.&quot; Ranma had assumed all this time that he was trapped in his 
own mind.

&quot;That isn&#146;t a fake Kodachi,&quot; he realized. &quot;And this is her nightmare. I&#146;ve been 
going about this all wrong.&quot; He watched as the fake ken tossed a shattered pair 
of glasses at Kodachi&#146;s feet.

&quot;Nooo!!!!&quot;

&quot;Great, I&#146;m stuck in the spirit world with a lunatic,&quot; Ranma muttered.

&quot;You are pathetic sister, perhaps you should train harder.&quot;

&quot;Kodachi, Mousse is fine,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Your brother is in hiding. This is a 
dream.&quot;

&quot;But, but&#133;.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s no dream Saotome,&quot; the dream Ken asserted. Ranma rolled his eyes.

&quot;You came here voluntarily, right? You&#146;ve haven&#146;t woke up yet have you?&quot; Ranma 
slashed his hand back and it passed through Kodachi&#146;s dream-Ken. &quot;It&#146;s not 
real.&quot; We walked over and grabbed Kodachi by the shoulders. She didn&#146;t even try 
and glomp him, which told him exactly how scared she was. &quot;Say it.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s not real,&quot; Kodachi repeated, shakily. Ranma swallowed, there was no way 
Kodachi would have lasted long in what ever place this was.

&quot;Mousse is fine,&quot; Ranma said patiently.

&quot;Mousse is fine,&quot; Kodachi repeated. Ranma breathed a sigh of relief, here&#146;s 
where he hit the experimental part of his plan.

&quot;There is nothing here,&quot; Ranma said, imagining nothing.

&quot;There is nothing here,&quot; Kodachi repeated. The scenery vanished around them, 
shattering into darkness. Ranma was no longer running story variations in his 
head, and he was doing his best to keep Kodachi&#146;s mind blank as well.

&quot;Okay, I have a plan,&quot; Kodachi groaned in the darkness. &quot;This one&#146;s a good 
plan!&quot; he protested.

&quot;I should not have taken that drug away from Nabiki, ne?&quot; She asked, calming 
down.

&quot;Never a good idea to get in Nabiki&#146;s way,&quot; Ranma agreed with a laugh. Then he 
was serious again. &quot;Okay, now getting back. Uh, think of home.&quot; The scenery 
began to shift around him, into the Kuno estate. &quot;Stop! Stop! Nothing here, 
nothing here.&quot; The area settled again into darkness.

&quot;What was that supposed to accomplish,&quot; Kodachi demanded irritably.

&quot;Hey, I&#146;m doing the best I can okay!&quot; Ranma retorted. &quot;Okay, other ways to 
possibly describe going home.&quot;

&quot;Ranma-darling,&quot; Kodachi asked shakily.

&quot;What is it, Kodachi?&quot; Ranma asked, resignedly as he tried to ignore her 
clinging to him.

&quot;What is that?&quot; Ranma turned around and saw something moving through the 
darkness. He could barely discern it was there, as if it was invisible or 
something.

&quot;Nothing there,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Nothing there.&quot;

&quot;Fortunately for you there is,&quot; the figure moved and then a head appeared, 
floating in the nothing. The head seemed familiar to Ranma, but he couldn&#146;t 
quite place it.

&quot;Who are you?&quot;

&quot;Someone who can lead you home.&quot;

&quot;So now we have two comatose martial artists,&quot; Ryoga shouted.

&quot;It&#146;s not my fault!&quot; Nabiki countered.

&quot;It&#146;s the same as before,&quot; Kasumi sighed. Her father was sitting to the side 
wailing. &quot;They&#146;re bodies will just waste away.&quot;

&quot;You always know what&#146;s going on around here,&quot; Ukyou snarled. &quot;Everything 
follows some plan of yours.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#146;t want this, why would I want this?&quot;

&quot;Oh my son, how could you have fallen so low?&quot; Genma shouted to nobody in 
particular.

&quot;There&#146;s probably some money it for you somewhere.&quot;

&quot;You think I&#146;d do this for money?&quot;

&quot;Sugar, you&#146;d do anything for money, don&#146;t deny it.&quot;

&quot;Where&#146;s the money in this?&quot;

&quot;Then what&#146;s your explanation? How&#146;d this slip past the great Nabiki Tendo?&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know,&quot; Nabiki shouted. &quot;I don&#146;t know. I&#146;ve missed a lot of things 
recently. I&#146;ve been distracted.&quot; She winced, wrong thing to say to two people 
that thought she was dating Shampoo.

&quot;Oh I get it now,&quot; Ukyou steamed.

&quot;Ukyou&#133;&quot; Ryouga tried to verbally restrain the chef without much success.

&quot;What do you get?&quot; Nabiki demanded quietly and dangerously.

&quot;You&#146;re too busy going to the movies&#133;&quot;

&quot;Ukyou, we promised not to say anything.&quot;

&quot;You promised, I never did.&quot;

&quot;That again?&quot; Nabiki shouted. &quot;Get it through your head, Shampoo is a client! 
She hired me to get Mousse off her back! She&#146;s not even a friend, got it? I 
don&#146;t have friends, if I went looking do you think I&#146;d start with an air-headed 
bimbo like&#133;&quot;

&quot;Nihao?&quot; Nabiki suddenly choked, she turned around slowly.

&quot;Sh-Shampoo? I didn&#146;t mean&#133;&quot;

&quot;What Shampoo care?&quot; Shampoo snapped angrily. &quot;Shampoo only here to check on 
Airen.&quot; The Amazon glared at Nabiki with that word, she hadn&#146;t even turned to 
look at Ranma yet. &quot;Great-grandmother say something might happened to him. What 
you know about it?&quot; Nabiki backed off a few steps and then slumped, staring at 
the floor.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry, Shampoo,&quot; she whispered, Shampoo flinched in surprise when she saw 
the other girl&#146;s shoulders begin to shake. &quot;I&#133;&quot;

&quot;Mousse!!&quot; everybody leaped as Kodachi woke up with a scream. &quot;Where&#146;s Mousse?&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s awake!!&quot; somebody shouted.

&quot;I heard Akane went to fight Ken,&quot; Everybody turned their attention to Ranma who 
was sitting up and working the crinks out of his joints. &quot;Where?&quot; He still 
wasn&#146;t certain this wasn&#146;t another dream, but he decided to chance it.

&quot;The fight is over Saotome,&quot; Mousse stood in the doorway.

&quot;Mousse!!&quot; The master of hidden weapons blinked in surprise as Kodachi clutched 
at him. &quot;I thought that freak had killed you!&quot;

&quot;Ranma!!&quot; Akane rushed across the room and nearly engulfed him in a hug of her 
own. &quot;You&#146;re awake.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m Kodachi you sightless idiot!&quot; 

*thwack*

&quot;Akane?&quot; Ranma answered. &quot;It is you, right, Not another dream or something.&quot;

&quot;Baka,&quot; Akane responded playfully.

&quot;Kawaiikune,&quot; Ranma answered, happy to be out of that nothingness. They 
snuggled, oblivous of the others around them.

&quot;But what happened?&quot; Genma asked. &quot;Did Kodachi bring you back?&quot;

&quot;Some woman in black led us back,&quot; Kodachi answered, Mousse dizzily stood up 
behind her.

&quot;A woman in black,&quot; Kasumi gasped. Soun looked up as well.

&quot;You actually saw her,&quot; he said.

&quot;Yeah, there was something familiar about her,&quot; Ranma said, him and Akane 
disengaging and trying to recover a little dignity. &quot;Wanted to warn Nabiki, said 
Nabiki&#146;d get lost if she &#145;projected&#146; right now.&quot; Kodachi watched them 
restraining themselves and left, Mousse looked from where Kodachi exited to 
Ranma, confused. Then he followed the noblewoman.

&quot;Wait, Kodachi!&quot;

&quot;Does that mean anything to&#133;&quot; Akane paused as she looked for her sister. &quot;I 
thought Nabiki was here before.&quot;

&quot;She was,&quot; Ryouga answered. &quot;Did anybody see where she went?&quot;

&quot;No care where money-girl went,&quot; Shampoo hmphed.

&quot;She must have slipped out while we were busy with the four of you,&quot; Ukyou 
decided. Kasumi left and soon walked back in carrying a note.

&quot;I have things to do, I hope to be back. &#150; N.&quot;

&quot;Intentionally uninformative and vaguely threatening,&quot; Genma said. &quot;This is 
definitely from Nabiki.&quot;

&quot;There&#146;s more, here on the other side,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;Shampoo &#150; Gomen nasai, you 
didn&#146;t deserve that.&quot;

Shampoo stared at the eldest Tendo and then walked through the wall, heading 
home. The sound of the wall collapsing was pretty much ignored by everyone else.

&quot;What was that in there?&quot; Mousse demanded. &quot;You&#146;re supposed to be getting into 
Ranma&#146;s good graces.&quot; Kodachi stared blankly for a very brief moment, then 
laughed.

&quot;He&#146;s was too concerned with Akane,&quot; Kodachi said quickly. &quot;Perhaps a little 
jealousy would help?&quot;

&quot;So you just used me then?&quot;

&quot;I thought maybe it would work for Shampoo as well,&quot; Kodachi mumbled.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Mousse muttered.

&quot;You didn&#146;t really think I was worried about you,&quot; Kodachi asked. &quot;I knew you 
could beat that fraud.&quot;

&quot;Actually, Akane beat him.&quot; Kodachi blinked.

&quot;She&#133;did?&quot; Kodachi blinked, a bead of sweat rolled down from her forehead.
No one seemed to pay him much attention as he stepped onto the plane, probably 
noticing the sling he had his arm in, but that wasn&#146;t very surprising. Lots of 
people took advantage of recovering from such injuries by going on vacation. He 
glanced about cautiously from behind a pair of black sunglasses.

&quot;Damn that girl,&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;Damn Saotome, damn all of Nerima!&quot; He 
decided that this place was his curse. When the fighters had used more 
traditional techniques he&#39;d been fine. Now, however, Akane Tendo was correct, 
the abundance of chi attacks left him vulnerable. He needed to do some actual 
training if he wanted to even think about taking on the Nerima elites again.

He sat in his assigned seat and continued to grumble.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; he looked up to see a tall girl with streaks of dyed blonde and an 
incredibly dark tan. She looked familiar, but he couldn&#146;t quite place her. &quot;This 
is aisle 24, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, what of it?&quot; he asked. The girl arched an eyebrow at him.

&quot;I&#146;m not in the mood, that&#146;s my seat over there,&quot; she pointed at the window 
seat.

&quot;I apologize, apparently we&#146;ve both had a bad day,&quot; Ken stood up and let her 
past. He was suspicious, there was something dangerous about this girl. He sat 
back down eyeing her carefully. &quot;So what&#146;s your story?&quot; She glared at him for a 
moment and then shrugged.

&quot;I just discovered the love of my life,&quot; she said nonchalantly. &quot;But there&#146;s no 
way they&#146;ll ever notice me.&quot;

&quot;Uh&#133;okay,&quot; Ken shrugged, and leaned back, keeping a suspicious eye on her, but 
avoiding further conversation.
