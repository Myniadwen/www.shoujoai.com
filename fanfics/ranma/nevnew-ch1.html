<h1>The Love They Never Knew</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shamie.html">Shamie-Chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Shamie-Chan: Yeah! I&#146;ve made it to my second fanfiction ever!!! I was so 
surprised by the reviews I received for my Kagome x Sango fic and it 
made me jump to getting a new fic done and here it is! Oh, here&#146;s the 
&#147;Deep Manly Voice&#148; to give you the rights and so on a so forth. ^^

Deep Manly Voice: Shamie-Chan in no way owns the characters of Ranma &frac12;. 
The characters are all works of the glorious Rumiko Takahashi.

Shamie-Chan: I only own the situation, not the characters. Enough with 
this and on with the fic!  ^o^;;


-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


It was Saturday night at Ucchan&#146;s and Ukyo was sitting at one of the 
tables, sipping some herbal tea, watching the TV mounted in the upper 
corner of the establishment. Closing time was a half hour ago and she 
was glad. There had been great business today but the rush of all the 
people was almost overwhelming. She was thankful for Konatsu, knowing if 
it weren&#146;t for him the day would have been a nightmare.

Her thoughts came to an abrupt halt when a figure casually entered 
Ucchan&#146;s front door. &#147;Shampoo&#133;&#148; Ukyo looked surprised at her company and 
decided this must be some new plot of Shampoo&#146;s to get Ranma, why else 
would she come. Shampoo was her rival chef and rival fianc&eacute;e for her 
Ran-Chan. &#147;You know it&#146;s called breaking and entering if you enter a 
closed establishment at night don&#146;t you honey?&#148;

Shampoo smiled and leaned against the wall to her side. &#147;We need talk 
spatula-girl.&#148; Shampoo glanced towards the door for a second but soon 
was looking straight into Ukyo&#146;s eyes again.

Ukyo knew something had to be going on, see looked over at the door and 
found nothing amiss. &#147;And what is it we need to talk about?&#148; Ukyo looked 
toward the wall Shampoo had been leaning against seconds ago, but found 
no one there. She turned abruptly to find Shampoo seated next to her. 
She jumped slightly, regained her composure, opened her mouth to ask how 
Shampoo did that but was cut off by Shampoo suddenly leaning forwards 
inches from Ukyo&#146;s face.

&#147;Great-Grandmother no happy. You take good business all day this day and 
she want know why.&#148; Shampoo continued looking deep in Ukyo&#146;s eyes.

Now Ukyo was officially uncomfortable, being so close to Shampoo. But 
soon she became annoyed. She looked sharply at Shampoo with a flustered 
face, &#147;Maybe it&#146;s because Ucchan&#146;s dinning is better than the Cat Caf&eacute;.&#148; 
Ukyo smiled when she saw a hint of anger pass through Shampoo&#146;s face. 
She leaned back in her chair becoming bored with the situation. 
&#147;Anyways, it&#146;s not like you can do anything about my business being 
better than yours. Maybe you walking around naked after turning back 
from neko-mode scares away your more fortuned customers, sugar.&#148;

&#147;Aiyaah! Is you saying Shampoo ugly?!&#148; Shampoo jumped out of her seat, 
looking down at Ukyo angrily.

&#145;Uh-oh,&#146; Thought Ukyo, &#145;I better not get her mad in here , I don&#146;t want 
to pay for the damage she&#146;d cause.&#146; &#147;Uhhh, Shampoo? Can we discuss this 
later? I&#146;m actually really tired from today&#146;s work and I don&#146;t think 
it&#146;d be fair to fight you when I have the obvious disadvantage.&#148;

Shampoo&#146;s face furrowed in concentration. She looked down at Ukyo again 
only to find her standing up next to the chair she had been sitting in. 
Then she looked at the door again and visibly became less tense. Her 
anger subsided and she let out a little whimper and she looked down at 
the floor.

Ukyo was intrigued. She looked at the door and still found it the same, 
she walked to it, opened it, found no one outside and shut it again. She 
plodded over to Shampoo angrily, &#147;This is starting to annoy me. What&#146;s 
going...&#148; She let her sentence trail off when she saw Shampoo&#146;s sad 
face. She looked like she was going to cry right then and there. Ukyo 
put her hand on Shampoo shoulder and whispered, &#147;What&#146;s wrong.&#148;

Shampoo shrugged Ukyo&#146;s hand away and stepped back. &#147;It nothing, I go 
now.&#148; Shampoo turned to leave but she was cut off by Ukyo, &#147;You know you 
can tell me what&#146;s wrong don&#146;t you sugar?&#148;

Shampoo looked annoyed for a moment but soon the sad look came over her 
face again. &#147;I no think it your business.&#148; Shampoo started going to the 
door again but was once again cut off by Ukyo, &#147;Obviously something is 
wrong, and I would like to know if I could help.&#148; Ukyo gasped inwardly, 
&#145;Why am I doing this for this girl, she&#146;s my rival!&#146; But one look into 
Shampoo&#146;s eyes told her to stay there.

Shampoo stood still for a moment thinking, than said, &#147;Okay, I tell 
spatula-girl. But you no tell anyone, you understand yes?&#148; Ukyo nodded 
her head and both girls sat at one of the booths. Shampoo put her head 
in her hands and stared blankly at the table. &#147;Great-Grandmother get 
letter. It say Shampoo must get a spouse in three week.&#148;

Ukyo gasped, first thinking that there was no way she was letting this 
girl get her Ran-Chan, then she thought about the command and 
discontinued to be mad. &#147;How can they force you to get a husband? That 
sounds cruel!&#148;

Shampoo looked up at Ukyo and blinked, &#147;Amazon counsel say my time is 
soon up. They already think they give to much time. Shampoo family will 
lose status if Shampoo no marry, so Great-Grandmother now pushing 
Shampoo very very hard to get Ranma.&#148; She looked at the table again and 
sighed, &#147;Great-Grandmother say I need get rid of nuisances who stand in 
way.&#148; 

Ukyo looked at Shampoo dumbfounded. &#145;Why is she telling me this?&#146; Then 
she saw a tear fall down on the table counter. Ukyo felt her heart beat 
hard. Now she and this girl may be rivals, but she didn&#146;t hate Shampoo. 
Even if she wanted to, she couldn&#146;t hate the bubbly Amazon. &#147;Shampoo, 
why are you telling me&#133;&#148;

&#147;Shampoo no really love Ranma, what Shampoo really love is living here.&#148; 
Ukyo&#146;s jaw dropped. Shampoo sat up and looked at Ukyo across the table. 
&#147;Shampoo no like Amazon village. Here I feel more worth, here I feel I 
have home.&#148; She thought a moment and continued, noticing how Ukyo&#146;s 
mouth was clamped shut, &#147;At home, many hate Shampoo for fighting skills 
and still so young. But Great-Grandmother want go home, she push Shampoo 
too too much to get spouse and stay in high rank.&#148;

It had never occurred to Ukyo that Shampoo liked living here. Then she 
thought about it harder and completely understood. She herself felt the 
same. Here she had people that cared for her, and here she had made a 
living and friends. She had never noticed the impact this community had 
on her.

Then she realized Shampoo wasn&#146;t nearly as dense as she thought she was. 
But soon she felt pity for Shampoo, knowing that Ran-Chan was the only 
person Shampoo could marry that fit the standards her village put on 
her. Mousse obviously cared for Shampoo, but she had beaten him before 
and the only other person she could think of was Ryoga, but Ryoga was 
still in love with Akane. Deep down she knew Ranma would never give into 
her or Shampoo. But she pushed those thoughts away when she felt the 
sorrow that came along with them.

Shampoo was looking at her funny when Ukyo came back to reality, &#147;Ukyo, 
I need spouse. I no need go back to village; I just need spouse to keep 
family in high rank. I no know what do!&#148; 

&#147;Shampoo, I have an idea,&#148; &#145;I can&#146;t believe I&#146;m doing this, she&#146;s my 
rival&#133; But she doesn&#146;t love Ranma, she&#146;s no longer a threat!&#146; &#147; I can 
pretend to be a guy,&#148; &#145;No no no no no! You cannot do this! What if you 
get caught? What if Amazons hunt you for the rest of your life if this 
plan gets screwed up?&#133; If I do this she&#146;ll stay away from Ranma.&#146; &#147;And 
we&#146;ll go to your Great-Grandmother and claim that I beat you in battle 
and she can leave back to your village and tell them. What do you 
think?&#148;

Shampoo looked up into her new friends eyes questioningly and only saw 
truth. Tears started flowing down her cheeks, &#147;You really do that for 
Shampoo?!&#148; Ukyo blushed and nodded. Shampoo lunged across the table and 
hugged Ukyo with all her strength, almost causing Ukyo to break a few 
ribs. &#147;Thank you! Thank you too too much!&#148;

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


One week later Ukyo was blushing severely, looking down at the official 
marriage papers her and Shampoo were about to sign. She had no idea 
Cologne was going to go to these extremes.

Cologne had ordered they stay in the same living quarters until she 
leave. Ukyo had been dressing like a boy ever since the meeting she had 
with Shampoo (not that that was out of the ordinary), and now they had 
to sign the papers right before Cologne, the cities mayor and Ryoga.

The only reason Ryoga was there was because he was the only person 
Shampoo and Ukyo knew they could trust and also the only person they 
knew they could talk into it on such short notice. Ukyo at the moment 
was rather irritated by Ryoga would had had a nosebleed since he walked 
in the room they&#146;d be signing the papers in.

Thankfully, Cologne was too happy to notice Ryoga&#146;s state. Soon the 
papers were signed and Shampoo and Ukyo were wed. As they were leaving 
Shampoo winked at the mayor, who winked back in return. Ukyo saw the 
exchange and raised an eyebrow at Shampoo. &#147;I tell &#147;husband&#148; secret 
later.&#148; Shampoo pretended to say it playfully as to not make Cologne 
suspicious. Ukyo blushed and gritted her teeth at the word husband but 
smiled non-the less.

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-



The next day, Cologne left to China, taking the paperwork with her. 
Before leaving she informed Shampoo that she expected an heir to their 
family, but that she was never going to see Shampoo again unless it was 
absolutely necessary.

Once Shampoo and Ukyo returned from the airport to Ucchan&#146;s, Ukyo 
stammered, &#147;Heir? And what was that secret you said you&#146;d tell me 
later?&#148; She was flushed and embarrassed about the situation, and also 
itching to get her bandaged off from around her chest. Cologne had been 
spying and she had not a single chance to get her bandage off and now 
she was starting to feel the pain from constantly wearing it. She only 
took it off during her showers that were guarded by Shampoo.

&#147;Oh!&#148; Shampoo smiled as they both walked up stairs to the house part of 
Ucchan&#146;s. &#147;I forgot. You no worry about heir, I no need that for some 
time.&#148; Ukyo sighed in relief. &#147;And I wink with mayor because he know our 
secret and we get divorce papers quick.&#148; They both heard someone enter 
the front door and a little &#147;Hello? I need to speak with a girl named 
Shampoo.&#148; Shampoo looked at Ukyo, said &#147;It here, I get.&#148; And took off 
back down stairs.

Ukyo continued walking up the stairs and swiftly made it to her bedroom. 
She looked around and saw hers and Shampoo&#146;s clothing sprawled across 
her floor. She took off her shirt and unbound her self and took a big 
breath of air. &#147;Oh, that&#146;s so much better.&#148; She fell forward onto her 
bed; she spread her arms wide apart.

It was quite surprising how fun this had been, her and Shampoo actually 
had a lot in common. Staying up at night and talking to her had been 
fun. Shampoo had placed her mat on the floor next to Ukyo&#146;s that 
morning, since now Shampoo was going to live with Ukyo, working as a 
waitress at Ucchan&#146;s because Cologne had sold the property of the Cat 
Caf&eacute;. They had been sleeping with each other before as to convince the 
ever-obsessive Cologne that they were seriously to be married.

As Shampoo walked back up the stairs she felt a lump in her chest. Ukyo 
was the first person she had ever really been a friend with. She was 
Shampoo&#146;s first friend and Shampoo knew this warm feeling she had for 
her was slowly growing to something more. This wasn&#146;t what she had 
expected to begin with. What she thought would happen was Ukyo laughing 
at her, telling her, &#147;Good luck!&#148; But she helped her, she went through 
all this and things were all good now!

She looked down at the papers she had been given and felt the lump grow. 
Her hand was on Ukyo&#146;s doorknob now and she knew that she loved Ukyo. 
She opened the door and found Ukyo lying topless on her bed. Her eyes 
grew wide and she froze.

Ukyo heard someone enter her room, squeaked and rolled over the side and 
came up with one of Shampoo&#146;s blouses covering her bosom. &#147;Shampoo!&#148; She 
calmed down, &#147;Knock next time, okay honey?&#148; Shampoo blushed and nodded 
repeatedly.

Shampoo&#146;s face saddened and she extended the papers to Ukyo, &#147;Paper&#146;s 
come.&#148; Ukyo could see Shampoo&#146;s hand slightly shaking and she looked up 
into her face. &#145;Oh no, she&#146;s going to cry.&#146;

With Shampoo&#146;s blouse still held against her she walked up to her friend 
and hugged her, &#147;It&#146;s all over now. You can stay here and things will be 
just fine.&#148; But that didn&#146;t seem to help as Shampoo wrapped her arms 
around Ukyo and started sniffling. Ukyo started running her hand through 
Shampoo&#146;s hair, when she thought to herself, &#145;I love this girl.&#146; Her 
heart started beating faster at the thought, &#145;No, I can&#146;t really love 
her, can I?&#146;

She pulled back from Shampoo, dropping the blouse but she didn&#146;t care. 
&#147;Shampoo, I&#133;I&#133; well&#133; umm&#133; I&#133;&#148; Ukyo couldn&#146;t say it, she was already 
shocked and didn&#146;t know what to do. Thankfully, Shampoo leaned forward 
answering her unasked question.

Their lips met and both girls&#146; thoughts and fears were far away from 
them. Both girls wrapped one another in each other&#146;s arms as the kiss 
became increasingly passionate. They pulled back for a breath and 
Shampoo raised her hand to cup Ukyo&#146;s chin, they stood there just 
looking at each other for a little before they started removing the rest 
of their clothes.

Both were blushing at what they were about to do and Ukyo smiled 
sheepishly at Shampoo. Once they were unclothed, Ukyo pulled a giggling 
Shampoo towards her and they embraced again in another passionate kiss. 
Ukyo placed Shampoo on her bed and lay against her. Enjoying the 
sensations Shampoo&#146;s luscious body was making her feel. She began toying 
with the Chinese girls tender breasts, softly kneading them and pinching 
her nipples, making Shampoo sigh and moan in pleasure.

Shampoo soon had Ukyo on her back, not wanting her to think she wasn&#146;t 
full of surprises also. She kissed Ukyo&#146;s forehead, then her lips, then 
began nuzzling, licking and sucking at her susceptible neck while her 
left hand trailed down between her breasts to play with her bellybutton.

Ukyo was gasping in rapture now. She loved the feeling of Shampoo 
touching her and placed her hand on Shampoo&#146;s shoulder blade pushing her 
towards herself. She felt Shampoo make her way down and moaned feeling 
lips around her hard nipples. Shampoo started suckling hard and Ukyo 
started gasping, She pulled Shampoo up over her again, their breasts 
squashing together and they kissed deeply.

Ukyo rolled Shampoo over and pinned her down, with no hesitation she 
went straight for Shampoo&#146;s lower lips. She thrust her tongue in and was 
rewarded with a cry from Shampoo who bucked her hips forward. When Ukyo 
stopped thrusting with her tongue she started gently licking Shampoo&#146;s 
nod of pleasure.

Shampoo&#146;s body was covered in perspiration and she became more and more 
tense. Ukyo could hear Shampoo softly whisper to her in Chinese, which 
sounded incredibly sexy and made Ukyo become even more satisfying than 
before. Ukyo placed a finger in Shampoo and she cried out Ukyo&#146;s name as 
everything around her melted and the only thing she felt or saw was 
ecstasy and Ukyo&#146;s body. Ukyo could feel Shampoo&#146;s walls tighten and 
throb against her finger. Shampoo fell backwards and nodded off.

She woke up to find Ukyo in the crook of her arm; she looked down at her 
friend and lover and kissed the top of her head. Ukyo stirred slightly 
but was still in a lazy sleep. Shampoo moved her way down Ukyo&#146;s body 
stealthily, spreading Ukyo open and lapping her up.

Ukyo&#146;s eyes flew open and she felt the tongue lick and suck and she 
moaned in bliss at these wonderful feelings. She began to move her hips 
in an ancient rhythm. Ukyo placed her knuckle in her mouth and her lips 
began to tremble. She had never felt so fulfilled before and this 
feeling was only growing stronger.

Shampoo was moving her tongue as fast as she could, and she felt Ukyo 
being plummeted into an earth shattering orgasm. She thrust her hips 
forward, screaming Shampoo&#146;s name as wave after wave over came her, and 
sent her hurtling into Shampoo&#146;s possession.

She awoke with Shampoo&#146;s sleeping form over her stomach sleeping 
soundlessly. Ukyo leaned her head over to the side and glanced at the 
papers Shampoo had brought earlier. &#145;Those can wait until later. And 
anyways, the law said Shampoo needed a spouse, not a husband.&#146; With that 
thought she placed her hands on Shampoo&#146;s back and drifted off into a 
sweet sleep.

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


On the cross-country airline flight to China Cologne laughed while 
looking at the papers. &#147;Do they really think I&#146;m that stupid? Oh well, 
the tribe asked for a spouse, and my Great-Grand Daughter now has a 
spouse!&#148; She took a sip of her soda and thought, &#145;I saw the attraction 
between the two of them from the start, it&#146;s a good thing I sent the 
girl to that Ukyo girl.&#146; She smiled, &#145;I know they&#146;ll be happy&#133; I wonder 
what they&#146;ll do about the heir?&#146;


THE END

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-


Shamie-Chan: I hope you enjoyed it! {YAWNS} I did all this in one day 
and now I&#146;m ready for bed.
