<h1>I Thought We Were Rivals</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a>

<pre>&quot;Nihao!&quot;

And with that, the lunchbreak at the Furinkan High School cafeteria was
marked once again by the entry of the town&#39;s resident Chinese Amazon as she
smashed--rather, *walked*--through the wall, delivering another fine example
of Chinese cuisine for the gastronomical pleasure of one Ranma Saotome.

&quot;Uh, Shampoo...&quot; was all Ranma could say as the Amazon approached him.  He
didn&#39;t look too thrilled to see her, despite the goodies that Shampoo was
carrying.  Maybe it&#39;s because her lunchtime visits have suddenly become a
bit too frequent over the last couple of weeks; maybe it&#39;s because of all
the undue attention that&#39;s focused on him whenever she comes by--as if he
isn&#39;t in the limelight enough as it is; maybe it&#39;s because the school&#39;s been
pressuring him--and by extension my family--to *pay* for all the walls
Shampoo&#39;s been demolishing.

Or maybe it&#39;s because his fiancee&#39;s right beside him.

That&#39;s me by the way.

&quot;Don&#39;t you ever use the door?&quot;  I asked Shampoo as she came up to us with
Ranma&#39;s &quot;order&quot;.

&quot;Husband hungry.  Shampoo have no time to look for door,&quot; she replied in her
usual condescending tone whenever we spoke to each other in front of Ranma.

&quot;Uh, Shampoo, we&#39;re in the cafeteria,&quot; Ranma spoke up, little beads of sweat
beginning to form on his brow.

&quot;Foo.  Cafeteria food gunk,&quot; Shampoo scowled, prompting the chef to give a
sour look of his own.  &quot;Husband need *real* food.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you mean like braised rat?&quot;  I asked, with raised eyebrows, as she
placed her noontime offering on the table.

&quot;Hmph,&quot; the Amazon sneered at me, &quot;at least Shampoo know how to braise rat
*properly*.&quot;

&quot;Uh, let&#39;s not ta--&quot; Ranma began to say as the sweat beads started to gather
into a little trickle.

&quot;You take that back.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Akane?  Truth hurt?&quot;

&quot;Akane, let&#39;s--&quot;

&quot;Butt out, Ranma,&quot; I interrupted him as I rose out of my seat.

&quot;You want fight?&quot; Shampoo asked me, her voice dripping with contempt.  By
this point the other students were beginning to put some distance between
themselves and us.  They know better than to hang around a danger zone.

&quot;Um, c&#39;mon, let&#39;s not--&quot;

&quot;I said butt out, Ranma,&quot; I snapped at him.  &quot;This is just between the
Amazon and me.&quot;

&quot;Aka--&quot;

&quot;She right,&quot; Shampoo said as she began to step back and assume a defensive
position.  &quot;Men not get between fight of women, although one of them *is* a
tomboy--&quot;

As expected, I blew my top off and lunged right at her, screaming bloody
murder as I swung left and right.  Shampoo blocked and dodged all my shots,
but she wasn&#39;t able to make any decent offense of her own.  Which was just
fine with me.

Ranma, as always, jumped in to try and stop the fight.  I was going to whack
him with a backhand; it wasn&#39;t as if I couldn&#39;t handle Shampoo on my own. 
But before I could lay a hand on him, Shampoo had raised her foot up and
nailed him squarely on the cheek as he rushed forward.  Ranma went down with
a thud.

&quot;Shampoo said this fight not concern men.&quot;

&quot;You bitch!!!&quot; I screamed with righteous anger as I threw myself at her. 
Unfortunately, I&#39;ve never really been that quick, and Shampoo merely
sidestepped my lunge and somersaulted towards the hole in the cafeteria wall.

&quot;Hope husband enjoy lunch!  Bye bye!!&quot; she waved at me with a smile that
just oozed smugness before running off.  Naturally, I wasn&#39;t going to let
her get away with this bullshit, and promptly went after her.

&quot;Akane!  Wait!&quot;  I heard Ranma&#39;s shouts as I leapt through the hole and saw
Shampoo riding off on her ten-speed.  Just then the bell sounded, indicating
the end of the noon break.

That didn&#39;t stop me from rushing off after her.

&quot;Akane!!&quot;

I looked over my shoulder as I leapt on top of the fence.  Ranma had
sprinted through the hole and was about to follow me.  Or stop me.

&quot;Stay out of this, Ranma!  It&#39;s just between the bimbo and me!&quot; I warned him
as I jumped over to the top of the fence.  Inside I swore to myself that if
Ranma followed me I was going to pound him into the ground.

&quot;HAPPO-FIVE-YEN-SATSU!&quot;

I turned around to see what was going on.  Lo and behold, Ranma Saotome was
lying in a heap on the school yard, another victim of the peacekeeping
efforts of Hinako-sensei.

Jumping down from the fence, I made a run for it before anyone else could
follow me.  It didn&#39;t take long before I saw a familiar head of lavender
hair, waving at me from around the corner on her bicycle.

Ready or not, here I come.

******

I guess I chased Shampoo for around ten minutes before I was able to catch
up with her.  By that time, we were already a good distance away from
Furinkan High School.  And by that time I was *really* mad at that bimbo. 

&quot;Well, finally caught up with Shampoo,&quot; she greeted me as I jumped up on the
roof she was on.

&quot;Damn it, you made me cut class!&quot; I yelled at her in between breaths.  &quot;What
were you thinking!&quot;

Shampoo gave me a rather seductive look as she said, &quot;Shampoo wonder if you
interested in resuming contest.&quot;

&quot;Con--you mean you dragged me out here just because you felt *perky*?  How
can you be so inconsiderate!  I&#39;ve got classes to worry about!!&quot;  I shouted
at her as my eyes began to haze over with anger.  &quot;You just can&#39;t do that,
Shampoo!  I&#39;ve got to take care of a math test this week!  My God, what do
you think people&#39;ll say when they find out--&quot;

My tongue got caught in my mouth when the haze in my eyes lifted for a
moment, and I saw her looking at me the way she does when Cologne was angry
at her.

My God, what have I done?

&quot;I--I&#39;m sorry, Shampoo.  I--&quot; I had to turn away from her; it&#39;s not often I
have to swallow my anger.  Neither of us said anything for several tense
seconds, until I calmed down enough to talk again.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have been yelling at you,&quot; I said as I turned to face her. 
&quot;I&#39;m really sorry.  But you just can&#39;t barge in and pull me out of class the
way you did, just because you wanted to be with me.&quot;

&quot;You were at *cafeteria*,&quot; Shampoo pouted as she looked down at her feet.

God did she look cute when she was pouting.

&quot;Alright, so I was,&quot; I sighed as I surrendered to the guilt creeping into
me.  No matter how hard I try, I just can&#39;t get my temper to stretch any
further.  &quot;But I still had classes to attend.  You could&#39;ve waited until
after school.&quot;  Shampoo didn&#39;t respond in any way--unless you considered her
pout to be her answer.  

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry for yelling at you like that,&quot; I said weakly.  There was
nothing else I could say.

The two of us just stood on the roof for some time.  Both waiting for the
other to say or do something.  Then, without a word, the Amazon before me
began to approach, her head still bent down.  When she was at arm&#39;s length,
she looked up, into my eyes, and said, &quot;Shampoo know.  Shampoo sorry too,&quot;
before she gave me a hug.  &quot;Shampoo just miss you so.&quot;

&quot;I missed you, too,&quot; I told her as I returned the embrace, and gave her a
quick kiss on the cheek.  &quot;It&#39;s just that--you know--&quot;

The sentence never finished; suddenly, the words I wanted to say--that
someone might see us...might start talking--just drifted away from me like
lost ships as we stood on that roof, holding each other.  It&#39;s as if a
sudden rainshower had descended on us, gentle and soothing in its
sensations.  For a few very magical moments, it seemed to dawn on me that I
may not need to vocalize my thoughts to her, as she nodded to me in silent
agreement, her hair and eyes reflecting the cool light of the spring sun. 
Either that, or I&#39;m still struggling to get used to how we relate to each
other nowadays. 

Then, she gently leaned her head towards mine.

And for several seconds, neither of us cared if anyone saw what we were doing.

&quot;Shampoo wait for Akane next time,&quot; she tenderly said promised as we broke
the kiss.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; I gave her a smile as I stroked her shiny, lavender hair.

&quot;Maybe Akane should go back to cl--&quot; Shampoo began to say, but I never let
her finish what she wanted to say.

It&#39;s hard to say anything when you&#39;re being French-kissed by someone.

&quot;No, Shampoo-chan,&quot; I told her with all the feminine charm I could muster--
after I pulled out of our kiss, of course.  &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be missing
*that* much in just one day.  Besides,&quot; I added with my own temptress smile,
&quot;I feel...perky...today.&quot;

******

The Nekohanten was closed when we went there, a sign hung from the door
saying that renovations were underway.

In short, Shampoo whacked up Mousse again.

&quot;Are you beating up Mousse just for my benefit?&quot; I asked her as we entered
and I saw the sunlight beam down from the man-shaped hole in the ceiling,
just a few feet from the doorway.

&quot;Akane!&quot; Shampoo exclaimed in mock horror, her face turning rather cute and
innocent-looking.  &quot;Why you say that?&quot;

&quot;Because this place&#39;s been going through a *lot* of renovating for the last
six weeks?&quot; I asked with a wry smile, my forefingers emphasizing the
quotation marks on the &quot;renovating&quot;.

&quot;Hmph.  Co--coan--coincidence,&quot; she muttered, her sweet-li&#39;l-ol&#39;-me act
disappearing into a smirk as she locked the door behind her.  She then
walked up to me and took my hand.

&quot;Time for fight,&quot; she gave me an evil smile as she led me upstairs.
I couldn&#39;t help but smile back at her choice of words.

Time for fight.  Contest.  How to keep the husband happy.

She used those same words on me when we did it the first time, a little over
two months ago.  &quot;Contest to be which one can bring...pleasure to other
first.  If can bring pleasure first, be better at it than other.  Better one
keep husband happier during cold nights,&quot; she said, her exact words.  I
accepted, and won.  I thought it would end there.  I really did.

&quot;Ready to lose?&quot; Shampoo slyly asked as we entered her room, giving my hand
a little squeeze.

&quot;Lose?  Hah!&quot; I taunted back as I locked the door.  &quot;There&#39;s no way you&#39;re
getting out of this one alive.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Shampoo gave a cute-yet-haughty look as we gave each other a
quick kiss, before she stepped towards the closet to pull out her futon.
I began undressing while she arranged the futon on the floor.  I could
already feel the heat that was beginning to build up inside as I took off my
clothes--slowly--much to Shampoo&#39;s enjoyment, as she looked up often while
setting the bed.

Soon enough, I was standing in front of her clad only in my bra and
panties.  Shampoo approached me, the yearnings in her eyes reflecting my own.

&quot;Shampoo miss you so,&quot; the Amazon told me as her hands reached for my breasts.

&quot;Uh-uh-uh,&quot; I shook my head as I gently pushed her away.  &quot;Not until I&#39;ve
undressed you.&quot;

Shampoo didn&#39;t argue with that as she helped me get her out of her clothes. 
She did try to caress me a few times, but I kept her hands off me.  We took
off her top, and out came her breasts.  Nice, full mounds of flesh that were
capped by beautiful tips of pink--and weren&#39;t restrained by a bra. Breasts
that I&#39;ve touched and kissed and suckled on.  Breasts that I wanted to touch
again.  Very badly.

I gently ran my fingertips over one of her nipples.

&quot;Eek!&quot; Shampoo jumped at the sensation.  &quot;Akane!&quot; she exclaimed, then tried
to return the gesture.

I nimbly stepped back from her reach.  &quot;Try and catch me, hentai!&quot; I giggled
as I backed up.

&quot;Hentai?  Shampoo show you!&quot;

She began chasing me around the room, the two of us giggling it off as we
ran in a circle.  As my running led me to the futon, I hit the brakes and
turned around.

Just as Shampoo tackled me and sent both of us right onto her bed.

&quot;Hentai got you now!&quot; she giggled as she glomped onto me the way Happosai
would, snuggling her head between my breasts.

&quot;Eek!  Get offa me!&quot; I squealed in mock-terror as I began tickling her.

Yep, it didn&#39;t take long for a tickle fight to begin.  We poked each other
in this place and that, laughing it off, until we ran out of breath.  The
two of us just laid in each other&#39;s arms for a few minutes, getting back our
second wind.

&quot;Shampoo miss you so,&quot; she whispered to me as she nuzzled my neck, her hands
gently caressing the valley between my breasts.

&quot;I missed you, too,&quot; I whispered back as I turned, and pressed my lips to
hers.  And soon, I felt the wonderful sensation of our tongues gently
touching each other.

Shampoo&#39;s highly-vaunted Amazon endurance rose to the occasion.  She pulled
up on top of me, our lips still locked together, and began to run her hands
up and down my sides.  I pulled her closer to me, stroking her soft,
lavender hair, our tongues exploring each other deeply.

&quot;Mmmm...&quot; I sighed a bit as I could feel Shampoo-chan work her way to my
bust, kneading my flesh that laid under the bra I still wore.  My own hands
did some traveling as well, and caressed their way down her soft neck, her
shoulders, her back, until they reached her ample breasts.

I could feel Shampoo squirm a bit as I played her two mounds, flicking her
nipples with my thumbs as she massaged mine.  We broke our kiss as she
pulled herself up to straddle on my hips, our hands mutually massaging and
squeezing each other.

&quot;Take off bra,&quot; Shampoo ordered me, her face flush with the pleasure I was
giving her.  She didn&#39;t need to tell me, though; the attention she gave to
my breasts wasn&#39;t enough any more, not with all that nylon in the way.  I
sat myself up to unclasp my bra, offering my lips to her again as I did so.

&quot;Mmmm...&quot; we both sighed as she accepted my offering with her own, and
resumed sucking each other&#39;s tongues as she pulled me into a fierce embrace. 
In no time my bra was off, and I could feel my bared, swelled nipples rub
against hers, as I my arms went around her waist, pulling her in closer to me.

We hugged and kissed with a frantic passion for some time--*sweet time*, I
should say--before Shampoo-chan pushed me back down on the futon. 
&quot;Now you lose,&quot; she gave me a wicked grin before she lowered herself on top
of me, to shower more of her delicious kisses on my neck, my shoulders, all
the way to my breasts.  I bit my lower lip as I then felt her take one of my
nipples in her mouth.

&quot;Shampoo-chan...&quot; I could hear myself moan while she nursed on my breast,
her hand twisting my other nipple.  God did I miss the way she touched me. 
I reached down to play with her own bountiful mounds. 

The heat that was inside me was now on a steady buildup.  Both of us were; I
could feel her respond to my hands as well, as she began to suck
harder--like she was trying to inhale me into herself.

After a thorough nursing, Shampoo released my nipple, giving it a final
lick before she moved over to work on my other breast, gently squeezing it
in her hand while her tongue teasingly ran over the tip.

&quot;Oooh...yes...Rrrrgh...&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but shiver as I felt an electric
current shoot through me from my groin.

Now I know where her other hand had wandered off to.

She gave me a dirty look as she licked my breast.  &quot;Soooo wet,&quot; she
naughtily said as I felt her hand rub against my mons from behind the
material of my panties, and was she right when she said how aroused I was.

And I had more than enough pleasure to give back.

&quot;Come here,&quot; I said between gritted teeth as I reached under her shoulders
and pulled her up, until her ample flesh was within reach.

I could hear her sigh softly as I had some fun with her delicious
breasts--massaging and squeezing the soft flesh, licking and nibbling on the
pink, hardened tips. 

&quot;Akane...&quot; her voice drifted out to me, her hands pushing my head against
her.  While I suckled, my hands went down to take hold of the pants she
still wore.  Shampoo caught on to what I was doing and stood up.  In a
flash, the pants were gone.

And in another flash, so was her underwear.

&quot;Nice pussy, yes?&quot; Shampoo grinned as she began to rub herself.

&quot;Shampoo!  You know it&#39;s not ladylike to use foul language!&quot;

&quot;But you still want me,&quot; she coyly replied as she stood over me.

&quot;I&#39;d be stupid not to,&quot; I said while she lowered herself, until I could
reach her treasure, sweet with the scent of Amazon.

&quot;So good...&quot; she moaned rather loudly as I made contact with her clitoris,
and began to make my way to her soft core.

******

We laid in her bed for quite a while, savoring each other&#39;s touch, each
other&#39;s kiss, the way gourmands would enjoy a feast.  And after the
feasting, the two of us were basking in the beautiful warmth of afterglow
that can only come around from such a thermonuclear meal.

&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; I cooed to her, my hand lazily running over her slim
belly.

&quot;You, too,&quot; she whispered as her fingers gently pinched and pulled at my
nipple.  &quot;For a tomboy.&quot;

I moved my hand down the inside of her thigh.

&quot;Yowch!&quot; Shampoo jumped up.  &quot;What that for!?&quot;

&quot;For calling me a tomboy,&quot; I replied with a smile.

&quot;Hmph,&quot; she grumbled as she rubbed the spot where I had pinched her.  &quot;You
hungry?&quot; she then asked.

Now that she mentioned it, I really *hadn&#39;t* had much to eat for lunch.
&quot;Yeah, I could use a bite.&quot;

&quot;I go whip up ramen,&quot; she said as she bent forward and gave me a soft kiss.

&quot;Mmmm...that&#39;ll be nice,&quot; I answered as I brushed some of her damp hair from
her face.  &quot;Maybe we should take a shower first.&quot;

&quot;Good idea.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo-chan?&quot; I asked as we got up to our feet.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Who won *this* time?&quot;

Shampoo gave me a knowing grin as she cupped my breasts, squeezing them ever
so gently, &quot;Who you think?&quot;

&quot;I think...&quot; I began, as I felt my body react again to those Amazon hands,
&quot;I think we should go another round.&quot;

&quot;Another good idea,&quot; her smile turned seductive as we went to the bathroom,
where we made a little more love as we cleaned each other up.

******

Neither of us had ever thought something like this would happen between us. 
And to imagine that this all started over eight weeks ago--with a dare.  We
got into another one of our arguments; as usual, it was over my femininity.  
Or as Ranma would like to say, my &quot;lack&quot; of it.  As the cliche goes, one
thing led to another, and we--for lack of a better word--&quot;fought&quot;. 

That was the first time either of us ever did it with another girl.  But the
odd thing--looking back--was that neither of us really found the idea
disgusting.  Mainly because we were doing it--the first few times, at
least--just to see who was better at lovemaking.  As I mentioned earlier, I
won the first time--I was better than Shampoo.  And I thought that that
would be the end of it.

Shampoo showed up in my room, two weeks after that.

To challenge me to a rematch.

I was going to throw the bimbo out.  I really was.  I had no time to take
her on and I told her that.  I was already having problems trying to deal
with Ranma--what with the pregnancy scare and all--and I had no time to
handle another sex-laced relationship.  Besides, *I* had won; there was
nothing else to prove.  I told her all that.

Shampoo won the rematch. 

You know, she would&#39;ve gloated, if she wasn&#39;t so tired out by what we did. 

But the Amazon won.  So we were even. 

The next thing I knew, I was being dared for round three.

&quot;You&#39;re really something, you know that?&quot; I remember telling her.  I
accepted her challenge, though; much as I&#39;d hate to admit, Shampoo *was*
better at me in a lot of things--but I swore that lovemaking was not going
to be one of them.  Unfortunately, we were both exhausted, so we decided to
have the &quot;final round&quot; about a week later.  We settled the time and place
moments before the Amazon slipped out the window, just as Kasumi was
knocking on my door, calling me to supper.

The countdown to the big &quot;fight&quot; went by without incident--Kuno&#39;s antics
don&#39;t count--though I have to admit I was rather pressured by the whole
affair.   I couldn&#39;t get support from the usual channels for this one; I
certainly couldn&#39;t ask Ranma--much less my family--for help on how to be
more &quot;passionate&quot; than Shampoo.  Anyhow this wasn&#39;t the typical fight, so
for the most part I went about my usual business.

The whole waiting game did get to me at one point, however.  I went to a
boutique and bought myself this *really* sexy teddy, complete with the lace
and see-through fabric.  Maybe it was providence, but I decided to wear
something racy for the big day, in the hopes that my opponent would finally
stop insulting my womanhood.  Or maybe I just wanted to spite her.  Either
way, I bought the lingerie.

Soon enough the week was up.  Surprisingly, neither of us ran into each
other the whole time.  An hour after the time we were supposed to meet, I
still had yet to see Shampoo.

My situation can pretty much be imagined: I&#39;m in my bedroom, where we&#39;re
supposed to settle this, the teddy under my usual pajamas, wondering what in
the world is keeping her.  I was going to give myself the victory by default
when I finally heard her tapping on the window.

&quot;What&#39;s the idea keeping me waiting?&quot; I asked her as she stepped inside.

&quot;You rather not know,&quot; she answered in that voice which tells you that she&#39;d
rather you *do* find out.  Needless to say, I was impatient enough to demand
to know why she was so late.

That was when she told me that Ranma and Mousse slugged it out in the
Nekohanten, and that she had to clean up the mess.

It was only then that I remembered tonight was Hiroshi&#39;s birthday party, and
that Ranma was invited to it.  Ranma asked me if I wanted to go with him. 
Only he didn&#39;t tell me where the festivities was going to be.

To put it bluntly, I freaked.  I wanted to turn my fiance into a pretzel.  I
wanted to turn Shampoo into a pretzel.

Seeing my reaction, Shampoo coolly said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry.  Shampoo not do
nothing with husband.  Not want get pooped before beating you.&quot;

That was more than enough to make up my mind not to lose to her.

&quot;Well then, I hope you&#39;re ready to be disappointed,&quot; I said, taking off my
pajamas to reveal the surprise underneath.

&quot;I hope you like it,&quot; I told my wide-eyed opponent in my most condescending
voice.  &quot;I bought it especially for tonight.&quot;

Shampoo took a good eyeful for an equally good number of seconds, before
quietly taking off her clothes.

And then it was my turn to get an eyeful of her surprise.

&quot;Like it?&quot; she coarsely yet seductively asked, striking a pose in a blue St.
Michael&#39;s nightie that gave her more curves in all the right places.

So there we were, both of us--as the Americans say--&quot;dressed to kill&quot; for
the evening.  And the funny part of the whole lingerie thing was that
neither Shampoo nor I had any real liking for the other.  We just both
dressed up to show that we--especially me--were prime specimens of our gender.

&quot;I guess we should begin,&quot; I said after recovering from her &quot;revelation&quot;,
which from where I stood was--as much as I hated to admit at the time--a
whole lot better than mine.

In a few moments both of us were caressing each other through the flimsy
material we both wore, pretty much like the way we began our first two rounds.

But I wanted to one-up her in some way, any way.  I was going to beat her. 
I was going to win.

So I kissed her.

She was surprised, as was I--a bit.  It was a spontaneous decision on my
part; it was also the only thing we haven&#39;t done to each other, even though
we&#39;ve already done the deed twice.  For a brief moment I smiled at my success.

Then she returned my smile--as well as my kiss.

That called for retaliation.

I kissed her back.

She kissed me back.

I kissed some more.  She kissed some more.

And then we were nibbling on each other&#39;s lips and tongues.  Lips and tongues
turned to necks and fingers and wrists and breasts and belly buttons and hips
and thighs and knees and slick cunts.  We rocked, we writhed, we shook.  A
million rainbow firecrackers were lit between us, setting off little
earthquakes that sent us rocking in really really nice, soothing ways.

And then it was over, and we found ourselves back in my room, in my bed.

In each other.

I never remembered feeling so--good all over.  It was almost like the first
time I did it with Ranma, just a little different though.  &quot;Wow&quot; just about
described it.  Looking at Shampoo, I could also see the &quot;wow&quot; in her cute
round eyes.  And I began wondering why I didn&#39;t see that the first couple
times.

It was then that realization gave us both a gentle nudge.

&quot;Shampoo?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

Frankly, I was blown away by my little discovery.  But I wasn&#39;t going to let
that stop me from asking her how she felt.  &quot;I--well--I think we&#39;re tied.&quot;

Alright, so I didn&#39;t ask her there and then.

&quot;Really?&quot; she blinked, almost as if she just woke up.

I nodded in the affirmative, not knowing what else to say; not knowing
whether to even ask her what I *really* wanted to ask.  It turned out she
had the same question in mind--she did a darn good job masking her real
response--but also decided not to bring it up.  You can imagine how I felt
when she finally brought up the question I wanted to ask.

So we didn&#39;t say anything more to each other.  We just laid there under the
covers, letting the magnitude of our little discovery just swallow us both
in quiet tremors of wonder.

That night, we didn&#39;t have sex. 

******

Weeks have passed, and with each day I get more convinced that that night
was the turning point, for the both of us.  To make the story short, we&#39;ve
found all sorts of reasons to keep up our sexual feud--and poor Mousse is
staying in the hospital a lot more often because of that.  To be honest, I
don&#39;t think either of us *really* want to win the feud that badly anymore. 
Actually, we don&#39;t take the contest seriously, period.  We don&#39;t even get
that violent with each other anymore, either.  Sure, Shampoo-chan still wants
Ranma and I&#39;m still ill-tempered about it.  But, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just not
the way it used to be.  And frankly, I really don&#39;t mind that we make love
and not war more often nowadays.

The two of us are going bowling next week, by the way.  Neither of us can
bowl, though.

I think we&#39;re gonna have a good time.  I don&#39;t know if what we&#39;ve got
planned out for next week can be called a date, but I know we&#39;re gonna have
a good time.

Now if only I can figure out a way to explain to everybody why I cut class
today.


                                  THE  END


The author&#39;s word...
        Well, there you have it.  My very first attempt at fan fiction. 
What do you think of it?  E-mail me!
        Anyhow, in case you&#39;re familiar with &quot;Ranma .05&quot;, yes, I loosely
based this story on one of the situations that came up in the first volume
of &quot;Ranma .05&quot;.  For those who aren&#39;t familiar with it (where have you
BEEN?), &quot;Ranma .05&quot; is a fanfic which explores the possible consequences
that might arise if sex (not the softcore nudity and fondling you see in the
real Ranma 1/2, but hardcore-let&#39;s-get-down-and-dirty SEX) was introduced
into the equation.  Well, there was a part of &quot;Ranma .05&quot; wherein Shampoo
and Akane engage in a &quot;contest&quot; to see who would be the better wife for
Ranma--&quot;better wife&quot; defined in a sexual context, that is.  Since Ranma
wasn&#39;t around to help them decide who was better in bed, both girls went
down on each other.  For all intensive purposes the whole scene was conducted
rather businesslike--&quot;fuck&quot; rather than &quot;make love&quot;.  Not long after that, I
was able to get my hands on the &quot;Lemonlist&quot;, a collection of anime-related
lemon stories posted at ftp.netcom.com.  Again, I found a lemon where Shampoo
and Akane got down and dirty--and actually turned out becoming friendlier
with each other (that&#39;s how I saw it, anyway).  It didn&#39;t take too much after
that for my really hentai mind to start wondering.  After reading the
&quot;Lemonlist&quot;, I couldn&#39;t help but think about the lesbian scene between these
two Ranma girls in &quot;Ranma .05&quot;.  The question &quot;what if their actions DID
create some sort of consequence?&quot; popped into mind.  It didn&#39;t take too much
effort after that to convince me to type this little story up.  I may have
succeeded, I may have failed.  That&#39;s for you to decide.  So flame me or
praise me, whydoncha?  Oh, and comments like &quot;It sucks&quot; don&#39;t count; you
gotta EXPLAIN why I suck.
