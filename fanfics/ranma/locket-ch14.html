Juri smiled, ushering out the last few customers out for the night. 
She locked the door, then joined the others in cleaning up for the 
evening. She helped Excel, Hyatt, Keiko and May in clearing the tables 
and stacking up the chairs.

Walking by the bar Juri noticed some half full glasses, so she dumped 
those in the sink. Collecting bottles and cans was pretty easy, so 
Hyatt got that job. Juri joined Minagi at the sink to wash glasses, as 
Ryouko wasn&#39;t delicate enough to do it. Personally, Juri thought that 
Ryouko just broke the plates intentionally, but it didn&#39;t bother her.

Sasami stepped out to announce that the kitchen was locked up for the 
night, so Juri quickly dried her hands to make her announcement. She 
got Nabiki from the office with the envelopes and them met everyone at 
the door.

&quot;We&#39;ve had a good six months since we opened,&quot; Juri smiled, &quot;good 
enough that I think bonuses are justified.&quot; She passed an envelope to 
each of them, and had to fight a smile at the looks on their faces.

Ryouko whistled softly, &quot;Thanks, boss!&quot; She seemed to sum up the 
feelings of them all, as they all tried to thank Juri at the same 
time.

&quot;Now that I&#39;ve buttered you up,&quot; Juri chuckled, &quot;here&#39;s the schedule. 
I plan on opening on Christmas eve, but Chirstmas day will be closed. 
The 26th will be our staff party, and you&#39;re all welcome to bring 
anyone you want, men included.&quot;

&quot;Anything special planned for Christmas eve?&quot; May asked curiously.

&quot;I&#39;d like to give out gifts from the Locket,&quot; Juri admitted, &quot;to every 
customer. But I&#39;ve never been very good at buying gifts. Who&#39;d like to 
help?&quot; she asked them hopefully.

Minagi waved her hand first, then Ryouko reluctantly did. Sasami 
volunteered eagerly, as well as Excel and Hyatt. By the end, everybody 
had volunteered, and a relieved Juri handed another set of envelopes 
out.

&quot;You still have to shop, too,&quot; Keiko said, giving Juri a scolding 
look.

&quot;Ok, Ok,&quot; Juri said, waving her hands in defense. &quot;Try not to go over 
$10 a gift,&quot; she added, &quot;you&#39;ve each got $200, so it should go far.&quot;

Nabiki smiled, rubbing her hands together, &quot;This is going to be fun!&quot;

The doors were locked, and they all split up for the night. And a 
day&#39;s Christmas shopping, too. Juri smiled, walking home as she 
considered what to get the staff. She wanted to give them each a gift, 
as well as the bonus.



Nabiki Tendo smiled as she walked down the street, the money in her 
pocket. Some people thought she was cheap, but that was only with her 
own money. Other people&#39;s money, she had no problem spending!

Nabiki walked by the shop absentmindedly, then stopped cold. She 
walked back, looking up at it curiously, then started to laugh. She 
ducked inside quickly, and several scruffy men quickly left. Several 
minutes passed, then Nabiki came out hauling several large bags of 
goods. She passed the shop&#39;s sign as she walked away, &quot;Adult Toys and 
Novelties.&quot;



Ryouko carefully picked and chose, pushing her cart up and down the 
aisles. Bottles of different styles and sizes built up, each one 
having been tried before and determined to be good.

The teller&#39;s eyes were wide as Ryouko pushed the cart full of booze up 
to her till. &quot;Will that be cash or credit?&quot; she asked faintly.

Ryouko grinned, &quot;Cash.&quot;



Hyatt and Excel rampaged from store to store, selecting items based on 
several qualities but mostly for their pure kawaii-ness.

&quot;This is so cute!&quot; Excel squealed, picking up the Sailor V doll.

&quot;Sempai?&quot; Hyatt blushed, holding something else up for examination: 
panties, with a cute Sailor V blowing kisses and hearts on them.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to buy that!&quot; Excel sighed. She chuckled, &quot;I wonder if any 
of the senshi wear ones like that?&quot;



Sasami and Minagi looked into their half full shopping cart 
doubtfully. &quot;Are you sure we should just get cooking stuff?&quot; Sasami 
asked. She&#39;d like it, but still.

&quot;You&#39;re probably right,&quot; Minagi admitted. They pushed the cart along, 
then Minagi&#39;s eyes lit up at the T-shirt shop. &quot;Look at that,&quot; she 
chuckled.

Sasami read some of the naughty slogans and blushed. &quot;Are you sure 
Juri would approve?&quot; she asked. One had a nearly naked lady, and read, 
&#39;Santa, I&#39;ve been good, very good!&#39;

&quot;No,&quot; Minagi laughed softly, &quot;but I think that&#39;s kind of the point.&quot; 
They went in the shop together, chuckling evily.



May carefully selected from each aisle, putting the boxes of 
chocolates together with the utmost care. She selected flavors and 
fillings to balance each other, while the shop attendants watched her 
in awe. Clearly, they were in the presence of a master.

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t want a job, would you?&quot; the girl wrapping the boxes of 
candy asked.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; May shrugged, smiling at her sweetly to soften the blow.



Keiko smiled, stacking up the manga&#39;s carefully. &quot;Ragnarock City, 
Chirality, Rose of Versailles, Miyuki-chan, X, ... hmmm...&quot; she said 
thoughtfully. She kept piling, eventually getting together all the 
titles she could find that were even mildly shoujo-ai.

&quot;Anything you&#39;d recommend?&quot; Keiko asked the shop girl.

She looked at the pile in awe. &quot;Clockwork Angels,&quot; she suggested, &quot;and 
the Kat and Neko manga from the west, maybe.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll grab those, too,&quot; Keiko smiled.



Juri browsed through her cart, checking to see if all the gifts were 
ready. She had wrapped everything for the staff, while also buying her 
share of gifts for the patrons. She nearly bumped into someone, and 
quickly apologized.

Setsuna looked into the cart in surprise, holding the hand of a 
somewhat younger, dark hared girl. &quot;Finishing your Christmas shopping 
at the last minute?&quot; Setsuna asked.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Juri smiled. The girl was looking in the 
shopping cart in longing, especially at the plushie of Chibi-Moon. 
Juri chuckled as she pulled it out and handed it to her.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t,&quot; Setsuna started to say, but she noticed how her 
companion held the doll with hearts in her eyes.

Juri said quietly, &quot;You&#39;re not getting that away from her unless you 
use force, I think.&quot;

Setsuna nodded, &quot;I guess your right.&quot; She smiled, &quot;I&#39;m forgetting my 
manners. Arisugawa Juri, I&#39;d like you to meet my daughter, Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;Daughter?&quot; Juri echoed, surprised.

Utena. Minagi, Ryouko and Sasami are from the series Tenchi Muyo.
