<a href="../ranma/blakrose-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>	&quot;Deal?!&quot; Genma bellowed. &quot;What do you mean 
deal, boy?! Saotome&#39;s don&#39;t make deals with 
Amazons! We--&quot; 

	Not bothering to give his father a sideways 
glance, Ranma produced a bucket of cold water and 
tossed it at Genma who instantly changed into a big 
fat flying pig. 

	Genma pig began to squeal indignantly at 
being in his cursed form as everyone who was 
unaccustomed to it looked at him with wide eyes 
before they began laughing. 

	Well, everyone except Ryoga. 

	Because Ryoga appeared to be shock. 

	&quot;Dad?&quot; said Ryoga in dim tones. &quot;Is that 
you?&quot; 

	For a response Genma pig nodded before he 
gave an embarrassed half squeal that would be the 
porcine equivalent of &#39;unfortunately&#39; if analyzed 
by zoologists. 

	Looking to his brother, Ryoga said, &quot;You and 
Dad have Jusenkyo curses too, Ranma?&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma snorted. &quot;It&#39;s the old man&#39;s 
fault though.&quot; He paused for a moment then blinked 
and said, &quot;You mean you got one too, Ryoga? Aw, 
man... Mom&#39;s gonna be really pissed when she hears 
about this.&quot; 

	&quot;No,&quot; said Ryoga as she shook his head. &quot;I 
don&#39;t have a curse. Tachi does though. He turns 
into a--&quot; 

	&quot;Now, Ryoga-kun!&quot; interrupted Tatewaki as he 
slapped his hand over Ryoga&#39;s mouth. &quot;No one is 
really all that interested in such details. Are 
they now?&quot; 

	&quot;Heh,&quot; Ranma gave a low chuckle. &quot;It figures 
that you&#39;d get cursed, Kuno. Me? I got pushed into 
a spring. But you? You&#39;re the type to go jumping 
right into one.&quot; 

	Narrowing his tawny eyes, Tatewaki took a 
slow step forward as he hissed, &quot;Saotome. I despise 
you for all that you are and all that you&#39;ve done 
to me and my family.&quot; 

	&quot;Your family?&quot; asked Ranma blankly. He formed 
a face of actual confusion as he said, &quot;What do you 
mean?&quot; 

	&quot;Kodachi! My sister!&quot; Tatewaki roared. &quot;You 
are responsible for her current status as a 
criminal! I know of your ways, Saotome, and 
whenever there is trouble you are always behind it! 
Whether it&#39;s because of your womanizing or your 
illegal habits involving theft, you and trouble go 
hand in hand like a husband and wife in wedlock!&quot; 

	At this comment, Genma pig squealed his 
agreement as he nodded his head fiercely. Forming a 
scowl, Ranma shot him a dirty look as he said, 
&quot;Shut up old man.&quot; Looking back to Kuno he 
continued, &quot;I dunno what you&#39;re talking about. So I 
date some, what&#39;s the big deal about that? And 
yeah, I like to do business while I travel. That&#39;s 
not a crime, is it?&quot; 

	&quot;You have defamed the Kuno family name and 
honor!&quot; shouted Tatewaki as he produced a katana 
out of nowhere. &quot;And now you shall pay for all of 
your sins!&quot; 

	&quot;Aw, jeez,&quot; said Ranma lowly. &quot;Not this 
again. Kuno man, I really don&#39;t have time to fight 
with you now. I got this deal with the Amazons to 
work out, y&#39;know? Besides,&quot; he paused to look at a 
distressed Kodachi. &quot;Can&#39;t you see that this is 
upsetting, Dachi? Lets hold off for a little bit, 
huh?&quot; 

	&quot;Saotome,&quot; Tatewaki snarled. &quot;That&#39;s a cheap 
trick to use against me but you won&#39;t escape so 
easily...&quot; 

	&quot;Brother dear,&quot; said Kodachi softly as she 
walked towards him. &quot;Please stop it... don&#39;t fight 
with Ranma.&quot; 

	&quot;Sister?&quot; asked Tatewaki in surprise. 

	&quot;Dachi?&quot; said Ranma in similar tones. 

	Ignoring both of their comments, Kodachi 
looked to Cologne and asked politely, &quot;Might we 
continue the details of our loyalty at a later 
time? It seems we have some personal business to 
settle before we can advance any further.&quot; 

	&quot;Of course,&quot; said Cologne with a dip of her 
head. She then hopped forward on her staff and 
handed Kodachi a piece of paper. &quot;Be at this 
address at five o&#39;clock tomorrow.&quot; 

	&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kodachi replied as she lowered 
her eyes in a gesture of respect which Cologne 
seemed intrigued at. 

	When Cologne moved back to talk quietly with 
her Great Granddaughters, Tatewaki moved to his 
sister&#39;s side. &quot;Why do you care for that cur 
Saotome?&quot; asked Tatewaki. &quot;He deserves to be 
punished for everything that he has done to you. I 
know that this was all of his doing. He has always 
been a troublemaker, even back in middle school.&quot; 

	&quot;Tachi,&quot; said Kodachi softly. She looked 
around the crowded room before she took his hand 
and led him out into the backyard where they could 
be alone. Much to her intense embarrassment she 
felt herself blushing under the gaze of her 
brother. Being with Tatewaki seemed to revert her 
magically to her childhood when she had last seen 
him. And when she was a child, Kodachi had been a 
profoundly shy person. &quot;I could not let Ranma 
darling suffer alone. He is my...&quot; She blushed 
furiously as she whispered, &quot;Boyfriend.&quot; 

	&quot;Boyfriend?&quot; repeated Tatewaki numbly. 

	All was silent for several moments as 
Tatewaki remained frozen. &quot;Brother?&quot; asked Kodachi 
in concern. &quot;Is something the matter?&quot; 

	Tatewaki&#39;s face was now dark red and steam 
was slowly coming out of his ears as he growled, 
&quot;Boyfriend.&quot; 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Kodachi anxiously. &quot;Ranma dearest 
and I have been dating for quite some time now.&quot; 

	At this comment Tatewaki&#39;s clenched jaw 
twitched and the vein on his forehead bulged to 
even greater size. In a slow mechanical movement he 
turned on his heel and walked into the sitting room 
to stand behind Ranma. 

	Noticing his presence, Ranma turned and 
smiled as he said, &quot;Yo Kuno. What&#39;s up?&quot; 

	&quot;Saotome,&quot; said Tatewaki in deathly quiet 
tones. He paused to lift his tawny gaze that burned 
with fury. When he did he screamed at the top of 
his lungs, &quot;I&#39;ll kill you!!&quot; 

	Releasing a high pitched yelp, Ranma hastily 
dodged Tatewaki&#39;s katana before he bounded out of 
the dojo with the angry Kendoist hot on his heels. 
Observing this with a wary expression, Kodachi 
said, &quot;That went well.&quot; 

	Sighing deeply, Kodachi shook her raven head 
before she bounded after the two boys. This was 
hardly the happy reunion that she had waited so 
long for. 

--- 

	&quot;Ranma!&quot; shouted Ryoga as he watched his 
brother being pursued by his best friend. He 
started to run after them but Genma pig bit the 
cuff of his pants leg. Looking down at his father 
with confused eyes he said, &quot;Dad?&quot; 

	Genma pig merely squealed indignantly and at 
this Ryoga laughed nervously then said, &quot;Uh... I 
don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying Dad. Maybe you should 
change back?&quot; 

	&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi said as she produced a 
steaming teakettle from out of nowhere. &quot;Would you 
like this?&quot; 

	Seeing the teakettle, Genma pig squealed 
loudly and nodded his head swiftly. Smiling at his 
reaction, Kasumi said, &quot;If you want it you&#39;ll have 
to promise me something.&quot; 

	On hearing the word promise, Genma pig&#39;s eyes 
widened but he eventually gave a slow agreeing nod. 
After all, he really did hate being in his cursed 
form. People tended to laugh at him when he was 
like this. 

	Well, laugh at him more than usual. 

	&quot;I want you to stop hounding Ranma about this 
engagement idea of yours. He and Kodachi are 
obviously in love,&quot; said Kasumi in a low whisper. 
&quot;Do you agree?&quot; 

	Genma pig&#39;s eyes widened before he gave a 
slow nod and with a smile Kasumi handed the 
teakettle to Ryoga then made her way over to 
Perfume and the Amazons. 

	Pouring the hot water over Genma pig&#39;s head 
Ryoga was relieved to see the big fat flying pig 
transform back into the far more familiar, and less 
comical, figure of his father. 

	&quot;Dad,&quot; said Ryoga with a quiet smile. &quot;It&#39;s 
good to have you back.&quot; He quickly formed a face of 
determination as he turned and said, &quot;But now I 
need to go after Tachi--&quot; 

	&quot;Leave them be,&quot; said Genma solemnly as he 
reached out to grasp Ryoga&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Your 
brother has to settle his problems with Tatewaki on 
his own. Besides, we have much more important 
things to talk about.&quot; 

	&quot;We do?&quot; Ryoga asked blankly. 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Genma paused to smile. &quot;We do.&quot; 

	&quot;Okay. Who are all these people? And why is 
one of them chasing Ranma with a sword?&quot; 

	Everyone turned to see Nabiki standing in the 
sitting room doorway with the a confused Akane 
behind her. 

	&quot;Oooh,&quot; Akane said in awe as she looked at 
Perfume. &quot;There&#39;s more of you! It&#39;s an Amazon 
party!&quot; 

	&quot;Akane,&quot; said Nabiki as she heaved a sigh. 
She nevertheless turned to Perfume and the others 
then said, &quot;Is this really the time to invite your 
relatives over? It&#39;s been such a short time since 
you first conned my sister into believing that 
she&#39;s engaged to you.&quot; 

	&quot;Conned?&quot; Perfume blinked. She looked to 
Kasumi with a puzzled expression and said, &quot;What is 
conned?&quot; 

	&quot;Never mind that, Perfume,&quot; said Kasumi 
wearily. &quot;Imotochan, I&#39;ve already told you before 
that Perfume and I are engaged under her laws.&quot; 

	There was a long moment of silence before 
Akane clapped her hands together and exclaimed, 
&quot;Yay! We&#39;re going to have a wedding!&quot; 

	When everyone recovered from their mutual 
face fault, Nabiki turned to Akane and said, 
&quot;Nobody&#39;s getting married.&quot; 

	&quot;But Oneechan just said--&quot; began Akane. 

	&quot;It&#39;s just their stupid laws,&quot; Nabiki 
interrupted. &quot;Kasumi is only engaged to Perfume 
under Amazon law. That hardly holds any power over 
Japanese citizens. Therefore she&#39;s free to do as 
she likes. The engagement is null here.&quot; 

	Studying Nabiki with lidded eyes, Cologne 
said, &quot;You are a clever one but such a mere 
technicality won&#39;t free your sister from her duties 
to Perfume and the tribe.&quot; 

	&quot;What duties?&quot; Nabiki hissed. &quot;She didn&#39;t do 
anything to deserve being trapped into a marriage 
with axe girl here.&quot; 

	&quot;What you say?&quot; started Perfume with a growl 
as she retrieved her aforementioned axes. 

	&quot;Stop this,&quot; came the soft yet commanding 
voice of Kasumi. She was standing in front of 
Perfume as to block her path towards Nabiki. 
&quot;Everyone stop this fighting. Nabiki,&quot; she said 
very softly. &quot;I have an obligation to Perfume. I 
might not understand or even like it but I accept 
it. And I wish that you would accept it too. 
Please...&quot; 

	Looking deeply into her sister&#39;s eyes Nabiki 
shook slightly as she bunched her hands into fists. 
&quot;Kasumi,&quot; she murmured. &quot;I won&#39;t say anything more 
about it but I want you to know that I think it&#39;s 
not right.&quot; With that, Nabiki turned on her heel 
and silently left the dojo while everyone watched 
her retreat. 

	&quot;Well,&quot; said Akane after a moment of pause. 
&quot;She&#39;s still acting awfully grouchy, isn&#39;t she 
Oneechan?&quot; 

--- 

	&quot;Aw c&#39;mon Kuno!&quot; Ranma cried out. He ducked 
yet another pass of the older boy&#39;s katana. &quot;Do we 
have to settle our differences with violence? It&#39;s 
so barbaric.&quot; 

	&quot;Filthy dog,&quot; hissed Tatewaki in between 
breaths. 

	Tatewaki paused in his attack to hold his 
katana in a defensive position. The two boys were 
battling on the rooftop to a local bakery and a 
large crowd had gathered on the street to watch the 
fight. Ranma noted this and gave a jaunty wave. 

	&quot;You make light of my challenge?&quot; Tatewaki 
said in a low growl. &quot;I despise you Saotome!&quot; 

	Meeting Tatewaki&#39;s gaze Ranma sighed deeply 
and rubbed his forehead as if trying to dismiss a 
headache. &quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you about 
that,&quot; he began. &quot;Why are you so angry at me? Is it 
because you think that I&#39;m just using Dachi? 
Because if that&#39;s it I can tell you right now that 
you&#39;re wrong. I know how I acted when we went to 
middle school together but I&#39;m not like that 
anymore.&quot; He took a step forward and pushed 
Tatewaki&#39;s katana into a lowered position. &quot;I&#39;m in 
love with Dachi. I would never hurt her.&quot; 

	&quot;You don&#39;t know what love truly is,&quot; said 
Tatewaki fiercely. &quot;I can recall you claiming to 
love all those girls you tossed aside like so much 
garbage.&quot; 

	&quot;That was then,&quot; said Ranma as he clenched 
his jaw. &quot;I haven&#39;t dated anyone but Dachi since I 
was sixteen.&quot; At this Tatewaki&#39;s eyes widened and 
Ranma chuckled. &quot;Yeah it took me about a year to 
win her over. And you know what I&#39;m like Kuno. I 
have the attention span of a gnat.&quot; He diverted 
cobalt eyes to look up at the sky. &quot;At first I only 
wanted her because she presented a challenge but 
then I fell for her.&quot; He took a step forward to 
bore a solemn gaze into Tatewaki as he said, &quot;I&#39;d 
do anything to make Dachi happy.&quot; 

	&quot;Very well,&quot; said Tatewaki in solemn tones as 
he slashed his katana through the air and pointed 
it at Ranma. &quot;You must abandon your criminal ways. 
My sister can never be truly happy living such a 
deceitful life.&quot; 

	&quot;Eh...&quot; Ranma mumbled while he scratched his 
cheek. &quot;No offense or anything but you haven&#39;t seen 
Dachi for a few years now. How do you know what 
she&#39;s happy with?&quot; 

	&quot;Saotome,&quot; growled Tatewaki. He moved closer 
with his katana and said, &quot;I thought that you were 
willing to do anything to make my sister happy. Did 
you not say that?&quot; 

	&quot;I did,&quot; said Ranma slowly. &quot;It&#39;s just that I 
don&#39;t really think that me acting all straight 
laced is actually gonna do that.&quot; Before his 
companion could say anything more he took a step 
forward and said in reasonable tones, &quot;Consider it 
this way Kuno. There are two sides of your sister. 
One side is yours. That Dachi is sweet and innocent 
and she blushes for some weird reason. Then there&#39;s 
my Dachi. She&#39;s hardly innocent but she is sweet 
and she never ever blushes. I say that we keep our 
two Dachi&#39;s and never have them mix. Or else it&#39;ll 
cause some sort of vortex like in Star Trek or 
something.&quot; 

	Tatewaki blinked before he slowly formed a 
wry smile. &quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking 
about,&quot; he said with dry humor. &quot;But I will 
acknowledge that you seem to care for my sister. 
Very well,&quot; Tatewaki pronounced as he lowered his 
katana. &quot;I shall leave you in peace but let it be 
known that if you ever hurt my sister horrible doom 
shall fall upon you.&quot; 

	&quot;That&#39;s just swell,&quot; Ranma said almost 
nervously. 

	&quot;Well,&quot; floated in Kodachi&#39;s lofty voice. The 
two boys turned to see her standing on the edge of 
the building wearing a small smile on her face. 
Walking forward she said, &quot;I can&#39;t say how pleased 
I am that you&#39;ve settled your differences.&quot; 

	&quot;We&#39;ve settled them,&quot; Tatewaki said. &quot;I still 
do not trust him entirely but I&#39;ll not interfere 
with your choices.&quot; He paused to add quietly, 
&quot;Yet.&quot; 

	&quot;Hmm,&quot; murmured Kodachi. &quot;That&#39;s good to 
know.&quot; She turned to Ranma and touching him lightly 
on the cheek she said, &quot;Why not join your brother 
now and speak to him of certain engagements?&quot; 

	&quot;Sure,&quot; Ranma said. He glanced past at 
Tatewaki who wore the usual stoic face and said, 
&quot;But what about...?&quot; 

	&quot;Never fear,&quot; said Kodachi softly as she 
formed a gentle smile. &quot;Tachi and I have much to 
catch up on. I believe that we&#39;ll journey to our 
former dwellings and reminisce. Do not wait for me, 
we shall take awhile.&quot; 

	&quot;All right,&quot; Ranma said before he gave 
Kodachi a quick kiss on the cheek. Bounding past 
Tatewaki he called, &quot;Later Kuno!&quot; 

	Watching Ranma&#39;s departure Tatewaki looked to 
Kodachi who was standing at his side and muttered, 
&quot;You do realize that he&#39;s horribly arrogant?&quot; 

	Smiling softly, Kodachi replied, &quot;It happens 
to be just one of his many charms.&quot; 

--- 

	&quot;Are you sure you won&#39;t stay for the night?&quot; 
asked Kasumi. 

	She was standing at the front entrance to the 
dojo saying goodbye to the Amazons who had decided 
to leave for the hotel that they&#39;d made 
arrangements to stay in. 

	&quot;I&#39;m sure child,&quot; said Cologne kindly. &quot;Your 
house is obviously crowded.&quot; She smiled wryly as 
she added, &quot;And I doubt that we&#39;ll get our 
treasures returned tonight what with all the family 
reunions taking place. Besides, we have much to 
discuss and I&#39;m afraid this isn&#39;t the most private 
of places.&quot; 

	At this Perfume muttered something under her 
breath and hearing it Shampoo snickered while 
Kasumi frowned. 

	&quot;Perfume,&quot; chided Kasumi. &quot;I thought that you 
were trying to stop using profanity?&quot; 

	Perfume opened her mouth to protest but when 
she met Kasumi&#39;s warm brown eyes she faltered and 
turned bright red as she mumbled, &quot;Sorry.&quot; 

	&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Kasumi said softly as she 
reached out to hold Perfume&#39;s hand. &quot;All that 
matters is you&#39;re trying.&quot; 

	Looking at Kasumi&#39;s hand holding her own 
Perfume turned an even darker shade of red and on 
seeing this Shampoo burst out into full on 
laughter. Whipping her head upwards, Perfume 
scowled then gently pulling away from Kasumi she 
retrieved her double bladed axes. And chasing after 
Shampoo, she shouted, &quot;No laugh at me!!&quot; 

	Observing this with a chuckle, Cologne looked 
to the wide eyed Kasumi and said, &quot;I hate to say it 
but you&#39;re going to have your hands full when it 
comes to my Perfume.&quot; 

	Watching the Amazons depart, Kasumi could 
only heave a deep sigh for a response. She had the 
worst feeling that Cologne was exactly right in her 
predictions. 

--- 

	&quot;And you know how your brother is,&quot; grumbled 
Genma as he continued to detail their adventures 
over the past year. &quot;He decided that he wanted some 
of those sparkly Amazon treasures and the next 
thing that I know I&#39;m being cheated out of a free 
meal.&quot; 

	Father and son were in the sitting room 
entrenched in deep discussion while Soun observed 
in something of a daze. Akane having abandoned them 
to go about her usual regimen of a thousand sit ups 
before lunch. 

	&quot;What did he steal anyway?&quot; asked Ryoga. He 
took a rice cake from the bowl on the table and 
began eating it. 

	&quot;What didn&#39;t he steal,&quot; Genma said as he 
rolled his eyes. &quot;That&#39;s more the question.&quot; He 
paused to give Ryoga a hard slap on the back as he 
said, &quot;But enough about that! I&#39;m just glad to have 
you with me again, son!&quot; 

	After spitting out the piece of rice cake 
he&#39;d almost choked on Ryoga said, &quot;I&#39;m glad to be 
here, sir.&quot; 

	&quot;Aw,&quot; Ranma&#39;s voice floated in from the 
doorway. &quot;Father and son bonding. I&#39;m touched.&quot; He 
smirked at Genma and asked, &quot;Why don&#39;t I get the 
mushy sentiment, Pop?&quot; 

	&quot;Because you&#39;re an ingrate,&quot; said Genma with 
a sniff. &quot;Ryoga&#39;s always been the responsible one. 
While you on the other hand have always been the 
slacker.&quot; 

	&quot;So in other words,&quot; Ranma began slyly. &quot;I&#39;m 
the one who takes after you.&quot; 

	&quot;Exactly,&quot; Genma said gravely. &quot;You&#39;re the 
one who takes after--&quot; He paused to narrow his eyes 
and scowl. &quot;Very funny.&quot; 

	&quot;I thought so,&quot; said Ranma as he smirked. 
Pushing off the doorway he was leaning against he 
walked into the sitting room and sat next to Soun. 
&quot;Tendo-san,&quot; he said seriously. &quot;I have something I 
need to talk to you about.&quot; 

	&quot;Oh?&quot; Soun asked curiously. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; 

	&quot;I&#39;m afraid that I can&#39;t marry any of your 
daughters,&quot; said Ranma sadly. &quot;I&#39;m in love with 
Dachi and I could never marry anyone but her. I&#39;m 
sorry.&quot; Just as Soun was about to say something 
Ranma beamed widely and slapped Ryoga on the 
shoulder. &quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean my brother can&#39;t 
marry one of them! He&#39;s too chicken to ask any 
girls out and he&#39;s a Saotome too! Ryoga would be 
just great!&quot; 

	&quot;Huh?&quot; Ryoga blinked as he stared dumbly at 
Ranma. &quot;But I have Mom&#39;s last name, not Dad&#39;s.&quot; 

	&quot;Dummy,&quot; whispered Ranma into his ear. 
&quot;You&#39;re still his son. That means you&#39;re a 
Saotome.&quot; 

	&quot;Oh,&quot; said Ryoga slowly. He shrugged then 
looked relaxed for a moment before the full 
implications of what his brother just said sunk in. 
&quot;Hey!&quot; he exclaimed suddenly as he leapt to his 
feet. &quot;What do you mean I can marry them?! I didn&#39;t 
know about any engagement!&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Ranma rolled his eyes. &quot;Pop 
has been talking about this thing for years and 
since you are the older brother I figure that this 
honor should go to you. And I think that a 
completely girl inept dweeb like you needs all the 
help that he can get.&quot; 

	&quot;I&#39;m not completely girl inept!&quot; protested 
Ryoga huffily. 

	&quot;You are too,&quot; said Ranma. &quot;When we were in 
middle school you passed out anytime a girl talked 
to you.&quot; 

	&quot;That&#39;s better than making a hobby of out 
seeing how many girls phone numbers I can collect,&quot; 
retorted Ryoga. 

	&quot;You&#39;re just jealous,&quot; said Ranma in sing 
song tones. 

	&quot;I am not!&quot; Ryoga replied fiercely. 

	&quot;Are too!&quot; Ranma matched his tone. 

	&quot;Not!&quot; 

	&quot;Too!&quot; 

	&quot;Not!&quot; 

	&quot;Too!&quot; 

	&quot;Not!&quot; 

	Soun looked warily over at Genma and asked, 
&quot;Is this what it&#39;s like having sons?&quot; 

	&quot;Pretty much,&quot; said Genma with a nod. 

	Directing his eyes back to the two feuding 
brothers Soun was thankful for having daughters for 
the first time in his life. Scooting closer to his 
old friend he asked, &quot;Is it true what Ranma said 
about Kodachi?&quot; 

	&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; said Genma with a sigh. 
&quot;Ranma&#39;s very much infatuated with her. I had hoped 
to get him over his crush with the beauty of your 
lovely daughters but now that Ryoga is here...&quot; 

	&quot;He can take over the engagement,&quot; finished 
Soun. He was studying the boys closely as Ryoga was 
now busy battling Ranma in the backyard over the 
koi pond. &quot;Do you truly think that he&#39;s a better 
choice for my girls?&quot; 

	&quot;Absolutely,&quot; said Genma with a nod. &quot;Ranma 
can be stubborn about these things. As he said for 
himself, I&#39;m afraid that Ranma is far too much like 
me.&quot; Genma slowly met Soun&#39;s gaze and said, &quot;And 
would you truly you want one of your daughters 
marrying someone like me?&quot; 

	Soun shuddered at the thought and said, &quot;You 
have a point.&quot; 

	He was about to say something more when a 
loud splash sounded and they turned to see Ryoga 
standing on one of the large boulders laughing. 

	&quot;Got you, Ranma!&quot; declared Ryoga 
triumphantly. &quot;That&#39;s what you get for teasing your 
betters!&quot; 

	&quot;Oh, Ryoga...&quot; called a sweet and melodic 
voice as Ranma rose out of the koi pond to reveal 
her elfin form. 

	&quot;R-R-R-Ranma?&quot; Ryoga squeaked as he hastily 
moved backwards only to trip and land on his butt. 

	Ranma wore a coy expression as she stood up 
in the pond and flipped her long blonde pigtail 
over one shoulder causing a shower of droplets to 
fall around her. Her wet Chinese style clothes 
clung to her lithe frame and gave her the 
appearance of some type of goddess. Ranma raised an 
eyebrow as she folded her arms over her chest and 
said, &quot;What? You don&#39;t recognize your own brother?&quot; 

	For a response, Ryoga promptly fainted. 

--- 

	&quot;It hardly looks as it once did,&quot; Tatewaki 
murmured. 

	&quot;No, it doesn&#39;t,&quot; Kodachi agreed with a sigh. 

	The two siblings were standing in the front 
walk to the once illustrious Kuno Mansion that had 
since become run down and deserted over time. 

	&quot;It still belongs to us, you realize,&quot; said 
Tatewaki after a long moment of pause. &quot;My Mistress 
saw to that.&quot; 

	&quot;Your Mistress?&quot; asked Kodachi in confusion. 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Tatewaki said softly as he began to 
slowly walk towards the front entrance to the 
mansion. &quot;Mistress Azami. She is the woman which 
raised me upon our father&#39;s vile abandonment. A 
goddess amongst the mortals.&quot; 

	&quot;The woman who adopted you,&quot; Kodachi said. 
&quot;Ranma dearest told me of her.&quot; She looked at her 
brother with an intent stare then noted, &quot;You care 
for her.&quot; 

	&quot;I love her,&quot; affirmed Tatewaki. &quot;She gave me 
the only family that I would know other than you.&quot; 
He turned to Kodachi and said, &quot;I still do not know 
why she did it but I shall always remain ever 
grateful for her kindness.&quot; 

	&quot;She sounds like a wonderful woman,&quot; said 
Kodachi. 

	&quot;That she is,&quot; murmured Tatewaki with a 
smile. 

	There was a long moment of silence while they 
inspected the abandoned grounds when Kodachi looked 
to Tatewaki. &quot;So,&quot; she began. &quot;We truly own all of 
this, then?&quot; 

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Tatewaki replied solemnly. &quot;We truly 
do.&quot; 

	Another moment of silence passed as Kodachi 
formed a slow smile and said under her breath, 
&quot;Perfect.&quot;

	&quot;&lt;Great Grandmother,&gt;&quot; began Perfume in a 
near hiss. &quot;&lt;How could you offer the demon thieves 
a deal? They are criminals! We should punish them 
with full force!&gt;&quot; 

	The group were back at their rather expensive 
hotel which had taken some time to get into 
considering the large amount of security they had 
because of an incident with some con artists. 

	&quot;&lt;Silence, Pur-fum,&gt;&quot; said Cologne calmly. 
&quot;&lt;Who are you to question my actions? I am the 
Matriarch.&gt;&quot; 

	&quot;&lt;I&#39;m sorry,&gt;&quot; Perfume said quietly as she 
flushed. &quot;&lt;But this isn&#39;t right, Great Grandmother. 
The both of them are our enemies. We can&#39;t trust 
them--&gt;&quot; 

	&quot;&lt;And who said I did, child?&gt;&quot; Cologne asked 
as she tilted her head to one side. &quot;&lt;I trust them 
about as much as I trust my fellow Elders. If 
there&#39;s one thing that I have learned in this life 
it&#39;s that sometimes it&#39;s best to turn your enemies 
into allies. Or at least lead them to think that 
you have.&gt;&quot; 

	&quot;&lt;How will you do that?&gt;&quot; asked Shampoo. 

	&quot;&lt;Simple,&gt;&quot; said Cologne who looked to 
Shampoo. &quot;&lt;These are smart enemies, the both of 
them, all we need to do is learn what they value. 
Not what they seem to value on the surface but what 
they truly value. Then we use this to make their 
loyalties into our own.&gt;&quot; 

	&quot;&lt;But how do we do that?&gt;&quot; Shampoo persisted. 

	Releasing a deep sigh, Cologne hopped away 
from her Granddaughters and towards the bathroom. 
&quot;&lt;Never mind,&gt;&quot; she said. &quot;&lt;It&#39;s something that 
I&#39;ll take care of on my own.&gt;&quot; 

	Watching as the door to the bathroom closed, 
Shampoo looked to Perfume and said, &quot;&lt;I have 
absolutely no idea what she&#39;s up to. How about 
you?&gt;&quot; 

	&quot;&lt;Great Grandmother,&gt;&quot; said Perfume as she 
gave her own soft sigh. &quot;&lt;Isn&#39;t someone easily 
understood.&gt;&quot; 

	&quot;&lt;Got that right,&gt;&quot; Shampoo said in droll 
tones. She then formed a mischievous expression and 
crossed to sit next to Perfume on the bed. 
&quot;&lt;Sooo,&gt;&quot; she began teasingly. &quot;&lt;Tell me just how 
your new Airen managed to defeat you.&gt;&quot; 

	At this question, Perfume turned bright red. 

	It was a good two hours before Shampoo 
finally got Perfume to tell her about her defeat at 
the hands of Kasumi. 

	And it was another two hours before Shampoo 
finally stopped laughing about it.

	Mousse didn&#39;t understand the Japanese. 

	Particularly the men. First they had started 
kissing her feet, then they chauffeured her around, 
then they bought her an assortment of expensive 
items, and now there was a large group of them 
outside of her hotel window serenading her. 

	Or they were trying to serenade her. 

	Yes, definitely trying because their voices 
weren&#39;t all that good and Mousse was considering 
calling the police just to get them to leave her 
alone. She would&#39;ve already called if the men 
hadn&#39;t bought her such nice gifts. 

	And Mousse really liked the set of ancient 
weaponry from the dark ages all the men had gotten 
her. There was no way that she was going to give up 
her brand new mace and extra strong set of wrought 
iron shackles. 

	Japanese men certainly confused Mousse but 
they were nothing next to the women. She couldn&#39;t 
understand one thing the women had said to her all 
day. 

	Well, not so much said as shouted at her. 
Things that Mousse was still puzzling over. 

	Things like: What&#39;s a harlot? Why is she one? 
What&#39;s a bra? And why should she put one on? 

	But if the day had taught Mousse one thing it 
was this: Girls could get men to do whatever they 
wanted. 

	Or at least she could. 

	And wasn&#39;t that a lesson enough? 

--- 

	&quot;Ranma... girl... elf...&quot; Ryoga babbled as he 
stared at Ranma who was drying out her blonde hair 
with a towel. 

	&quot;Y&#39;know, we&#39;ve already discussed this, 
Ryoga,&quot; said Ranma. She paused in her hair drying 
to peek cobalt eyes up and under the towel which 
made her look very sexy. &quot;Is your brain stuck on 
pause or something? Snap out of it.&quot; 

	Ryoga was about to reply when Ranma decided 
to take off her red silk shirt and his eyes going 
wide, Ryoga hastily covered his nose as he whirled 
around so that his back was facing Ranma. In this 
position, Ryoga shouted, &quot;Don&#39;t you have any 
feminine modesty?!&quot; 

	&quot;Modesty?&quot; repeated Ranma who scrunched up 
her nose and looked at a frozen Soun. &quot;Should I 
have modesty?&quot; 

	At this question, Soun remained frozen. 

	&quot;Man, all you guys are pathetic,&quot; Ranma 
snorted. She tossed her towel over her bare 
shoulder and put her hands on her hips. &quot;Why are 
you freaking out about this? I&#39;m a guy.&quot; 

	&quot;But now you&#39;re a girl,&quot; Ryoga retorted. 
&quot;Dummy!&quot; 

	&quot;Dummy?&quot; said Ranma with a scowl. &quot;Who&#39;re you 
calling a dummy you big blockhead?&quot; 

	&quot;Ranma,&quot; interrupted Genma in a low growl. He 
was the only person in the room who wasn&#39;t effected 
by Ranma&#39;s shirtless state. &quot;Put your shirt on and 
get the girls.&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Ranma snorted again. &quot;And tell 
me why should I do anything that you say, old man?&quot; 

	&quot;Because if you don&#39;t,&quot; Genma&#39;s eyes gained a 
rather dangerous glint. &quot;I&#39;ll tell them your 
darkest secret.&quot; 

	There was a moment of pause and Ranma turned 
white as a sheet as she said, &quot;No way. You 
wouldn&#39;t...&quot; 

	&quot;Oh yes, I would,&quot; said Genma grimly. 

	&quot;Yeah! Me too,&quot; Ryoga piped up as he kept his 
hands covering his eyes. &quot;I&#39;ll tell everyone! All 
of the girls!&quot; 

	&quot;Ryoga!&quot; said Ranma in outrage. &quot;How could 
you do that to me? Your very own brother!&quot; 

	This statement caused Ryoga to frown and look 
guilty before he eventually said, &quot;You left me no 
choice, Ranma. If you&#39;d just put your shirt back 
on...&quot; 

	&quot;Ranma,&quot; said Genma as he looked to Ranma who 
still wore a scowl on her beautiful features. &quot;Come 
here.&quot; 

	In a slow movement, Ranma crossed over to 
Genma who looked into her eyes and said lowly, 
&quot;Look boy. I know that you don&#39;t want this 
engagement. That&#39;s all well and good but there&#39;s 
still a promise to fulfill. If you don&#39;t hurry up 
and put on your damn shirt and get all those girls 
down here right now it&#39;s you who&#39;s going to end up 
fulfilling it.&quot; 

	Ranma opened her mouth, and sensing that it 
was a protest of sorts, Ryoga said ominously, 
&quot;Wiggl--&quot; 

	Before Ryoga could finish, Ranma shuddered 
and turned a ghastly pallor before she hastily 
tugged her shirt over her head then went barreling 
out of the room and upstairs to go retrieve the 
three Tendo sisters. 

	&quot;Heh,&quot; Genma gave a soft chuckle as he looked 
to Ryoga who now had his eyes uncovered. &quot;Good 
work, son.&quot; 

	&quot;Thanks Dad,&quot; replied Ryoga with a grin. 

	It wouldn&#39;t be until sometime late tomorrow 
evening that Ryoga would finally realize that by 
him doing this he had helped his father and Ranma 
to stick him with the engagement. 

--- 

	Nabiki stopped in the middle of enjoying her 
most secret vice, watching Kung Fu movies, on 
hearing the sound of fingernails clawing on the 
door to her bedroom. 

	&quot;Nabchan! You gotta come downstairs quick!&quot; 

	&quot;Ranma?&quot; asked Nabiki as she turned off her 
television and pushed herself up off her bed. 
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; 

	By the time she opened the door to her room 
Nabiki could only see the end of Ranma&#39;s blonde 
pigtail sailing down the stairs. Puzzling at this, 
Nabiki looked to Akane who was standing in the hall 
with her also looking very confused. 

	&quot;Oneechan?&quot; said Akane. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; 

	&quot;I have no idea,&quot; murmured Nabiki as she shut 
the door to her bedroom. &quot;But lets go and find 
out.&quot; 

	When they walked downstairs they found Ranma 
tussling with Ryoga on the floor as it seemed that 
he had finally gotten over his shock about Ranma&#39;s 
elfin form. This was probably because Ranma had her 
shirt back on. 

	Standing in the doorway to the sitting room, 
Nabiki said dryly, &quot;Is this what you wanted us to 
see? Wrestling?&quot; 

	&quot;I love wrestling!&quot; Akane exclaimed. 
&quot;Remember when I got invited to the star on one of 
their shows?&quot; 

	&quot;How could I forget?&quot; replied Nabiki. 
&quot;They&#39;re still calling here asking to speak to the 
&#39;Kawaii Wonder&#39;.&quot; 

	&quot;Ranma,&quot; said Kasumi in chastising tones as 
she entered the room. &quot;Wrestling just isn&#39;t 
ladylike.&quot; 

	At this point both Ranma and Ryoga were on 
their knees with their hands locked and were trying 
to overpower each other. It looked like Ryoga had 
the upper hand and was about to win the match when 
Genma interrupted them by hitting both of his sons 
on the top of their hard heads. 

	&quot;Ow,&quot; Ranma and Ryoga complained. 

	&quot;Why&#39;d you do that, Pop?&quot; asked Ranma sourly. 

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; echoed Ryoga in equally sour tones. 
&quot;Why?&quot; 

	Ignoring their questions, Genma turned back 
to Soun who was still frozen. Giving Soun a good 
shake he said, &quot;Get a hold of yourself, Tendo!&quot; He 
paused to add slyly, &quot;Unless you really don&#39;t want 
to fulfill our promise after all.&quot; 

	The reaction was immediate, Soun formed a 
huge demon head which served to frighten both Ranma 
and Ryoga while his daughters looked exasperated on 
seeing it. Genma in the meanwhile appeared to be 
quite nervous. 

	&quot;SAOTOME!&quot; roared Soun&#39;s now mammoth demon 
head. &quot;HOW COULD YOU SAY--&quot; 

	&quot;Calm down!&quot; Genma held up his hands hastily 
and waved them around as he thought maybe getting 
Soun angry wasn&#39;t the best way to snap him out of 
his daze. &quot;I was just making idle chatter. Of 
course I don&#39;t want to break our promise. Look, 
I&#39;ve even gathered everyone for the announcement!&quot; 

	Reverting back to normal, Soun looked at his 
daughters and at Genma&#39;s sons then broke out into a 
wide smile. &quot;Well, then!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Lets get 
to business!&quot; 

	&quot;Business?&quot; asked Nabiki suspiciously. 
&quot;Daddy, what&#39;s going on? What is this all about?&quot; 

	&quot;It&#39;s very simple, Nabiki,&quot; said Soun as he 
continued to smile. &quot;Ranma cannot carry on with the 
engagement so his brother Ryoga had volunteered to 
replace him.&quot; 

	&quot;Yup!&quot; Ranma affirmed, slapping Ryoga hard on 
the back. &quot;My big bro is just cool like that, 
arentcha Ryoga?&quot; 

	Ryoga couldn&#39;t reply because for some 
mysterious reason he was gagged with one of his own 
bandannas. So instead he made a muffled sound and 
glared at Ranma. 

	&quot;He&#39;s such a good boy!&quot; Soun said while he 
sobbed an ocean of happy tears. &quot;Aren&#39;t you, 
Ryoga?&quot; 

	Ryoga made another muffled sound and at this 
Nabiki shook her head and rubbed her forehead in 
such a way that it implied she was getting a 
headache. &quot;Daddy,&quot; began Nabiki in a very slow 
pronunciation. &quot;You have him tied up.&quot; 

	&quot;Not true!&quot; said Genma indignantly. &quot;We have 
him gagged. And that&#39;s a very different thing, 
Nabiki.&quot; 

	While Nabiki looked aggravated at this, a 
light bulb finally went on inside of Akane&#39;s slow 
working mind. She looked at Ryoga then back at Soun 
then back at Ryoga as she recalled hearing the 
words engagement and replace. 

	That was when Akane looked at Kasumi who 
looked as if she was already aware of this fact. 
And when their eyes met both the sisters came to a 
silent decision. 

	They would sacrifice the dateless member of 
their family to the great beast of arranged 
engagements. 

	Or in other words, they were foisting it onto 
Nabiki. 

	&quot;Pick Nabiki!&quot; cried out Akane and Kasumi. 

	&quot;What?&quot; asked Nabiki in shock. 

	&quot;Pick Nabiki!&quot; repeated Akane who knelt down 
in front of the gagged Ryoga who looked at her with 
wide eyes. &quot;I can&#39;t get engaged, the last time I 
dated someone seriously it caused a riot in 
downtown Nerima for three days!&quot; 

	&quot;And I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;m already engaged,&quot; 
said Kasumi who knelt down next to Akane in front 
of Ryoga. &quot;To a very nice but somewhat violent 
Chinese Amazon with axes.&quot; 

	On hearing the somewhat violent part, Ryoga&#39;s 
eyes went even wider and slowly his eyes rested on 
Nabiki who was still standing in dim shock at her 
sisters actions. 

	&quot;Nabiki hasn&#39;t dated anyone,&quot; Akane whispered 
into his ear. &quot;And she&#39;s really nice underneath it 
all. Plus she&#39;s the only one of us who knows 
martial arts. You both have tons in common.&quot; 

	&quot;And she doesn&#39;t care quite as much about 
money as everyone seems to think,&quot; Kasumi added in 
encouragingly. 

	Before Nabiki could regain her wits to make a 
protest, Ryoga made another muffled sound and 
gestured towards her in a frantic movement. Seeing 
this, Soun burst into a virtual flood of tears and 
said, &quot;He&#39;s picked Nabiki! I&#39;m so happy!&quot; 

	Moving to hold Nabiki in a tight hug, Soun 
said, &quot;My little girl is growing up so fast! You&#39;ll 
be an excellent wife!&quot; 

	&quot;Wife?&quot; Nabiki numbly repeated. 

	It was at this point that Nabiki regained her 
wits. 

	A few seconds later all of Nerima would hear 
her outraged scream echo throughout the night. And 
when they heard it they all couldn&#39;t help but feel 
sympathy for anyone related to or anywhere near the 
girl named Tendo Nabiki.  --- 

	&quot;So she&#39;s sorta loud,&quot; Ranma said as he 
patted a now gagless Ryoga on the back. &quot;But she&#39;s 
a really nice girl. Trust me on this, big bro. And 
she&#39;s a real looker too.&quot; 

	&quot;My ears,&quot; Ryoga complained who was covering 
them with his hands. &quot;Are still ringing.&quot; Looking 
at Ranma he wore a scowl as he said, &quot;This is all 
your fault. Tricking me about this dumb engagement! 
How could you?&quot; 

	&quot;Hey,&quot; said Ranma with a shrug. &quot;You let it 
happen to yourself. In this life you&#39;ve gotta learn 
to think on your toes or else you find yourself 
dealing with the cleanup.&quot; 

	&quot;Whatever,&quot; muttered Ryoga. 

	After a moment, Ryoga turned almost against 
his will to look at Nabiki who was conferring with 
her very guilty looking sisters in the sitting 
room. Doing this, Ryoga couldn&#39;t help but note that 
Nabiki was very attractive. 

	In a loud martial arts girl sort of way. 

	Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be so bad after all. 

--- 

	&quot;How could you?&quot; Nabiki accused in a low 
hiss. &quot;You two just stuck me with this! Haven&#39;t 
either of you ever heard about solidarity among 
sisters?&quot; 

	&quot;What?&quot; Akane blinked in confusion. 

	Nabiki released a low groan and looked to 
Kasumi. &quot;Imotochan,&quot; said Kasumi. &quot;We&#39;re sorry. 
Really we are, but this is for your own good. 
You&#39;ve never even dated. We just wanted to give you 
the chance to be with a nice boy.&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah!&quot; piped up Akane. &quot;And a really cute 
one too!&quot; 

	&quot;I&#39;m not a leper,&quot; Nabiki growled. &quot;I can 
find my own dates! Not like I can find one now, 
what with being saddled in this stupid engagement 
thanks to you two!&quot; 

	&quot;Nabiki,&quot; said Kasumi in quiet enforcement. 
&quot;We know that you&#39;re upset but please calm down. 
You don&#39;t want to make a bad impression on Ryoga, 
do you?&quot; 

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Akane agreed. &quot;He&#39;s looking at you.&quot; 

	Despite herself, Nabiki tinged at this 
comment and turned to catch Ryoga looking at her 
with a serious expression on his handsome features. 
Immediately on seeing her looking at him, Ryoga 
turned beet red and quickly turned around so that 
his back was facing her. 

	&quot;Wow, Oneechan,&quot; said Akane in happy 
wonderment. &quot;Did you see him blush? He must think 
that you&#39;re cute.&quot; 

	&quot;He seems like a sweet boy, Nabiki,&quot; said 
Kasumi. &quot;Even if you don&#39;t like this engagement, 
please don&#39;t take it out on him. That just wouldn&#39;t 
be polite.&quot; 

	Still looking at Ryoga&#39;s back, Nabiki quietly 
mulled over her sisters words as she considered the 
look that she had seen on her newfound iinazuke&#39;s 
face. Doing this, Nabiki couldn&#39;t help but note 
that Ryoga was very attractive. 

	In a shy martial arts guy sort of way. 

	Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be so bad after all.
