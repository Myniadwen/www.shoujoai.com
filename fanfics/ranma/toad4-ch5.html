<h2>Between the Darkness  and the Light</h2>
<p>Orihime looked  down to where Lin Tzu had finally cried herself to sleep, and decided it was  time to intervene.</p><p>
  She  slipped out of the bed, careful not to disturb Ye-Ying or Lin Tzu, and padded  to the door.  As she grasped the <em>Dragon’s Wrath</em>, her armor formed,  sheathing her nude body in smooth silk and cool golden metal.  She nodded to the guards as she left the  Imperial bedchamber and headed to the rooms given to the Emissary.</p><p>
  “I  have come to speak to Lady Phoenix,” she told the serving maid who answered her  knock.</p><p>
  “She  is indisposed, Noble Guardian,” the servant said as she bowed in apology.  “She has not slept well, and will not eat.”</p><p>
  Orihime  raised an eyebrow.  “I see.  I have just come from the Empress, who has  also been suffering from this malady.   Perhaps you could let Lady Phoenix know I have come to possibly offer  aid.”</p><p>
  “Xianghua?  Who is there?” a voice called from deeper in  the suite.</p><p>
  The  servant turned.  “It is Lady Orihime, my  lady.”</p><p>
  Lady  Phoenix appeared in a doorway, her long dark hair in disarray, and the short  red skirt she wore rumpled from being slept in.   She fixed Orihime with red rimmed eyes, having obviously been crying  recently.</p><p>
  “What  do you want?” she asked rudely.</p><p>
  Orihime  ignored the insult as she bowed slightly.   “I have come on behalf of my Empress, Lady Phoenix.  I had hoped perhaps I could find a way to  overcome the difficulties that have arisen.”</p><p>
  “What,  you came to beg me to sleep with her?   She tried to <em>MOLEST</em> me last  night!”</p><p>
  Orihime  sighed, and leaned the <em>Wrath</em> against  the wall as she waved the serving girl away.</p><p>
  “My  empress can be a trifle… enthusiastic, Lady Phoenix.  I apologize on her behalf.”</p><p>
  Phoenix sniffed.  “I –  I…” more tears fell from her eyes as she turned away.</p><p>
  Orihime  crossed the room and placed a hand on the distraught woman’s shoulder.  “Please forgive her, Lady Phoenix.  She has no head for wine, and she had too  much last night.  She has spent the night  crying, fearing that she has destroyed the friendship she has forged with you  by her drunken advances.”</p><p>
  Phoenix sobbed.   “Advances?  She practically had me  stripped naked before I even knew what she was up too.”</p><p>
  “I  must apologize for that as well, My Lady.   I fear Ye-Ying was distracting me, or I could have perhaps enticed her  to turn her attentions to me.  I failed  in my duties as her Guardian and as her wife.”</p><p>
  Phoenix turned and looked at her with tear streaked  eyes.  “It wasn’t your fault,  Orihime.  I – I would have utterly failed  in my duties as Emissary without your help and advice.  I know Lin Tzu is interested in me.  I – I just… I wasn’t ready for her to express  her interest so directly.”</p><p>
  “My  beloved cannot love less than wholeheartedly, my Lady Phoenix.  She loves too intently to offer less than the  entirety of her self.”</p><p>
  Phoenix hung her head and took a seat on a soft cushion,  inviting Orihime to sit as well.  “I – I  have wondered many times what Lin Tzu finds so attractive about me.  I am just a simple warrior.  I don’t even know why Queen Serenity decided  to send me as her Emissary to the Court of the Dragon.”</p><p>
  Orihime  smiled and reached out to Phoenix’s  hand.  “You are one of the chosen  Guardians of the Moon Princess, and that is a far cry from a ‘simple  warrior’.  Serenity chose wisely when she  sent you.  I have met the other Senshi,  and much as I respect them all, only you care about Lin Tzu as <em>more</em> than a friend.”</p><p>
  Phoenix looked at her.   “Wha – what do you mean?”</p><p>
  Orihime  clasped Phoenix’s  hand in both of hers as she leaned forward.   “You do not reject Lin Tzu’s love for you out of hand.  I know you find her attractive.  I have spent too much time watching the two  of you together to miss the signs.  Had  my love not overstepped last night, perhaps in a month, perhaps in two, I doubt  not you would have accepted her advances.”</p><p>
  Phoenix blushed.  “I –  I feel as if I betray my friendship with you, Orihime, to admit that I have  thought of your wife as a lover.”</p><p>
  Orihime  lifted Phoenix’s  hand to her lips and kissed it softly.   “I would not view it as anything other than the fulfillment of my <em>own</em> desires, Phoenix, for I have come to love you as much  as she.  I cannot deny that the soul of  fire you possess has drawn me as a moth to a flame.”</p><p>
  Phoenix sighed softly.   “You – you love me?”</p><p>
  Orihime  smiled.  “My telling you does not offend  you?”</p><p>
  Phoenix shook her head.   “I – I cannot say that I have not come to love you as well.  I have never thought I could so love a woman.    I  have always wished to catch Jadeite’s eye, but he has no thought of any these  days save Beryl.  I never expected to  find love here, amidst the splendors of the Imperial Palace.”  She blushed.   “I cannot deny that I was scandalized when my Queen commanded me to so  notorious a Court.”</p><p>
  Orihime  shook her head.  “I know my love has  caused much commotion among the nobles of Earth with her choice of bedmates,  and the number of them, but can you say that we do <em>not</em> truly love one another?”</p><p>
  Phoenix shook her head.   “I cannot.  I had never understood  Neptune and Uranus until now, but I have never met souls that have called to me  more than Lin Tzu and your sister-wives,” she said softly, her eyes  lowered.  “I have for months yearned to  be loved so as well.”</p><p>
  Orihime  moved to sit next to her and placed an arm around the slender woman’s  shoulders.  “Now that you know that you  are, will you not join us?  Ye-Ying has  been pestering me for weeks to ask you.”</p><p>
  Phoenix smiled shyly.   “Even such as she?  How can <em>I</em> compare to the Songbird of the Imperial Palace, Lady Nightingale?  She is acclaimed everywhere as one of the  great treasures of Lin Tzu’s court.”</p><p>
  Orihime  laughed gently.  “Would it please you to  know I was distracted by her asking me to help her with an ode to her glorious  bird of fire?  Despite her incredible  voice, my darling songbird is not the most adept of scholars; she is a far  better warrior than she has ever been a song writer.” She hugged Phoenix tighter.  “You should have heard the flowery phrases  Ying-Ying was supplying her with.  The  Imperial Physician was as extravagant as any lovesick bard.”</p><p>
  Phoenix  blushed again and smiled softly.</p><p>
  “We <em>all</em> love you, my darling Sailor  Mars.  We all <em>welcome</em> you.”</p><p>
  “I  welcome you as well, Orihime.  <em>All</em> of you.”  She sighed.   “I – I just was not prepared for the intensity of the desires Lin Tzu  displayed last night.  I – I was not  ready.”</p><p>
  Orihime  nodded in understanding. “Since my love has been claimed by the Dragon, she has  gained many unique gifts.  She is like a  raging mountain stream, pure and swift and exhilarating.  Even <em>I</em> can be overcome by the intensity with which her affections can be  delivered.  Yet I cannot deny that it is  also what finally won my heart.  I fought  her desires until I could fight her no more, and when I could no longer  struggle against the currents of her love, when I finally allowed her to take me  where she willed, I found a happiness beyond any measure.”</p><p>
  Phoenix sniffed and smiled shyly.  “Perhaps it is simply I am too poor a swimmer  for such currents.  I – I am too young  and inexperienced to enter so dangerous of waters.”</p><p>
  Orihime  reached out to stroke her cheek.   “Perhaps you should learn to swim in a placid lake first.”</p><p>
  Phoenix closed her eyes and sighed softly.  “I – I think I would like that very much, my  lady…”</p>
<p>* *  * * *</p>
<p>Ukyo  opened her eyes to look into the concerned face of Rei, who was gently wiping  her forehead with a cool cloth.</p><p>
  “My  Lady Phoenix,” she whispered softly as a smile crossed her lips slowly.</p><p>
  Then  sleep claimed her again.  No longer the  sleep of fever dreams and memories, but the gentle sleep of healing rest…</p>
<p>* *  * * *</p>
<p>Kagura  woke to the quiet of sunrise, and blinked as she took a second to recall that  she was in the tent she was sharing with Sango and Kagome.  She looked around to see that Sango was  asleep sitting up against the tent pole, a bowl of water and a damp cloth in  her lap.  </p><p>
  She  nodded again as she remembered getting stung by the wasp.  The youkai hunter must have been tending her  fever when she fell asleep.  It was  surprising.  She would not have expected  such concern for someone like her.</p><p>
  She  closed her eyes again as she decided she was not quite ready to try moving  around much yet and her thoughts drifted back to the conversation she had been  having with Nabiki.  It had been so  confusing, though she thought she understood the gist of it.  Her dreams had been so chaotic, filled as  they were with the images of a phantom figure touching her body, touching her  with their lips, and even their tongue.  Her  hand rose under the blanket to caress her nipple.  </p><p>
  <em>I have often wondered why it felt so  good to touch myself here and between my legs.   It must have been this thing called an orgasm that I have felt, this  strange but pleasurable sensation that I have occasionally brought myself  to.  I had thought it curious that Naraku  had given me such a weakness, such a method of being rendered helpless and  unable to move, but perhaps it is simply something Naraku never considered,  something that is simply innate in my existence.  There have certainly been enough youkai I  have had to kill for attempting to use me as a sextoy simply because Naraku  made me female, but it was always an attempt by them to dominate me, to show  their strength.  I never considered that  perhaps there was more to mating among humans than such simplistic power games.</em></p><p>
  Her  hand found its way lower, and she investigated the warmth and wetness.  <em>It does  feel very pleasurable to touch myself so, yet even on those occasions where I  have felt secure enough to incapacitate myself for such feelings, they have  always left me feeling like there should be more.  It has always puzzled me that it leaves me so  helpless yet so desiring of repeating the sensations, and so filled with a  yearning to which I had no name.</em></p><p>
  She  sighed as she removed her fingers, and sat up, the blanket falling to her  lap.  She looked down at her breasts, and  their erect nipples.  <em>Perhaps the reaction to my being unclothed  is due to the knowledge that these have some function in sex?  That would explain the monk’s behavior  towards Sango, I suppose.  Her combat  dress is very form fitting.  Clothing has  always simply been a convenience,  simply  a way to blend in among humans, but perhaps I should try to be more aware of  it.</em></p><p>
  She  found her yakuta and dressed before stepping to the opening of the tent.  Outside she could see Kagome nursing their  fire back to life as Inuyasha brought her an armful of firewood.  The young girl yawned and waved at her.</p><p>
  “Glad  to see you’re feeling better.”</p><p>
  “Yes.  I feared we were too far away for a  rescue.  I hope that the monk did not  injure himself by using his kazaana.”</p><p>
  “Actually,  Nabiki saved you both.    Inuyasha smelled  them, but from what he said, she had killed the whole swarm by the time they  got there.”</p><p>
  “Yeah,  I squashed them between my shields.” Nabiki said with a yawn as she poked her  head out of her tent.  “Only thing I  could think of at the time.”</p><p>
  Kagome  sighed.  “Can’t you put on some clothes  before you come outside?”</p><p>
  Nabiki  stuck her tongue out at the younger girl as pink fog suddenly sheathed her from  breasts to mid thigh, clinging to her like a second skin.  “That better?”</p><p>
  Kagura  smiled.  “So long as you do not forget  and allow it to disappear.  I am finding  myself amazed at the cleverness with which you are using one simple magical  skill.”</p><p>
  Nabiki  laughed.  “Nothing to it really,  Kagura-san.  Too many years reading  superhero comicbooks.  Figuring out how  to manipulate the shield into any shape I want has far more to do with Green  Lantern than with me giving it any serious thought.  Once you showed me how to make them, and I  could make them solid enough, the rest was easy.”</p><p>
  “I  see.  But tell me, can you manipulate  more than just a single shield?”</p><p>
  Nabiki  nodded.  “So far, the best is three, so  long as they are pretty simple.”</p><p>
  “Perhaps  once you have practiced for a few more days I will attempt to teach you the  only other magical art I know, that of actually sensing the flows of  youki which surround us.  If you do as well with that, then you should  be able to tell what is occurring around you even when it is not visible.  Had I not been distracted yesterday and  allowed myself to be caught unaware, we might have avoiding this  unpleasantness.”</p><p>
  “Yeah.  Rei and Ukyo got attacked too, but Rei  incinerated her bunch.  Ukyo got stung  though.”  Nabiki looked at Kagome.  “She still sleeping?”</p><p>
  Kagome  nodded.  “She was when I woke up.  I think Rei was with her half the night.  She’s got to be exhausted.”</p><p>
  Nabiki  yawned again as she nodded.  “Yeah, that  makes two of us.”</p><p>
  “Your  tiredness is for entirely different reasons,” Kagome said with a huff.</p><p>
  “I’m  a bunny girl.  He’s a cat.  We’ve both got libidos off the charts.  I’ll try to be a little less  enthusiastic.”  She stretched.  “Well, I’m off to the little bunny bush.  What’s for breakfast?”</p><p>
  “Oatmeal.”</p><p>
  “Yuck.  Oh well.   Maybe we can find a pig later.   I’d kill for some bacon.”</p><p>
  Kagura  took a seat on a nearby log and enjoyed the warmth of the fire as Nabiki  wandered towards the designated bathroom bush.   As she vanished into the small copse of trees, Tatewaki emerged from the  one on the other side of camp and walked into the center of the area that they  had been using yesterday to spar in.  She  watched in interest as he assumed a stance and began going through his kata  slowly.</p><p>
  It  was interesting really.  In the early  morning light, his features mirrored Sesshomaru’s impassive demeanor, and there  really was a grace to the motions of his body and sword.  She compared him to Inuyasha, who was  currently lounging against a tree behind Kagome, and she could easily see  traces of the inugami in his descendant.   But that was where the similarity ended.   She’d fought Inuyasha enough times to know he was fast and agile, but  the way he moved was vastly different from the way that the swordsman  moved.  Tatewaki had an elegance that  Inuyasha lacked, much like his older brother Sesshomaru.  </p><p>
  Then  she noticed that Kuno had seen her looking at him so intently, and he blushed,  his motions momentarily halting before he closed his eyes and her sharp ears  heard him muttering “I must be worthy!   No matter how pretty she is, I will not become a fool.  I must be worthy!  I cannot ask her to date with me!”</p><p>
  Kagura  blinked.</p><p>
  Then  Tao-Ching came out of his tent, his massive blade over his shoulder, and headed  over to the practice area while inviting Kuno to spar.  She turned back to the fire as they limbered  up.</p><p>
  And  smiled…</p>
<p>* *  * * * </p>
<p>When  Ukyo awoke again, it was early morning, and Kagome was sitting beside her with  a bowl of warm oatmeal.  Ukyo blinked and  tried to sit up, wincing at the remnants of pain in her side.  A wave of dizziness came and passed quickly  as Kagome reached out a hand to steady her.</p><p>
  “Careful.  The poison is out of your system, but you  might be a bit dizzy for awhile.  Miroku  usually is.”</p><p>
  “What  happened?”</p><p>
  “You  got stung by one of Naraku’s wasps.  So  did Kagura.  You’re both fine, but you  probably should eat something before you try to move much.”</p><p>
  Ukyo  nodded and accepted the bowl of oatmeal.   “How is Rei?”</p><p>
  “Rei  is fine.  We found you two in the middle  of a half mile wide circle of fine ash.   Rei says she lost her temper when you got stung.”</p><p>
  “Wai  for being a Senshi.  All I remember is  hearing a buzz and then searing pain.  I  guess that must have been the sting.   Glad she was there.”</p><p>
  “Yeah.  Nabiki saved Kagura from another swarm of  them.  Naraku uses them as spies and  assassins.  Miroku has been poisoned a  bunch of times because Naraku uses them to make him keep his hand sealed.  We think they were hunting for Kagura, and  probably attacked you because it was an opportunity.”</p><p>
  “I  see.  How long was I out?”</p><p>
  “Just  the night.  Rei was up half the night  taking care of you, until your fever broke.   She’s still sleeping.  Totosai is  outside, but he said take your time.”</p><p>
  Ukyo  handed the empty bowl back.  “No, if he’s  done, I want to see it.”  She stood  carefully, waiting for a second as the dizziness passed, but it went quickly,  and with food in her stomach, she felt almost normal.  She nodded to herself and straightened her  tube top and tights, then stepped out of the tent.</p><p>
  She  found Totosai sitting by the campfire, watching as the fighters sparred.  Tao-Ching was explaining something to  Inuyasha while Kuno and Miroku demonstrated.   It looked like the white haired youkai was grumbling, but listening.</p><p>
  The  smith looked at her as she approached, the long metal shaft in his hand  gleaming golden in the morning light.   Ukyo looked it over, noting the counterweight at the base of the staff,  and the long bag that covered the blade.   Totosai nodded as he stood.</p><p>
  “I  have finished, Lady Ukyo.  It is a simple  blade, but the balance and weight should be right.  It hungers for your hand.  Much of yourself was imbedded within the  metal of your axe, and it joined with the essence of the single gold dragon  scale I had left.  It is no comparison to  the <em>Wrath</em>, but as I promised, it is a  weapon that will serve you well.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching  and the others had come over on noticing that she had come out of the tent, and  they looked on as the smith held out the weapon.  Ukyo bowed, and reached out to let the smith  gently place it in her hand.  </p><p>
  From  the moment it touched her hand, she felt the rightness, and as Totosai untied  the cover and drew it from the blade, she felt herself smile.</p><p>
  It  was plain, unadorned.  As he had said, a  simple weapon, but she knew the curves of its blade, the weight of its metal,  the sweep of its razor sharp tip.</p><p>
  Totosai had copied the <em>Wrath.</em></p><p>
  Right  down to the long crimson ribbon that hung from a small ring at the back of the  blade.</p><p>
  She  placed the stubby pyramidal spike at its base against the ground as she held it  upright and bowed.  “Thank you,  Totosai-sama.  I do not know how to repay  you.”</p><p>
  Totosai  smiled.  “You can repay me by coming back  to me with the <em>Dragon’s Wrath</em> once  more in your hand.  Seeing my master’s  finest work back in the hands of its true owner is all I ask.”</p><p>
  Ukyo  nodded solemnly.  “When I have recovered  it, I shall somehow find you, and give you that payment.”</p><p>
  Nabiki  smiled.  “Lo Shen said Totosai lives near  the palace in our time.  We’ll be able to  keep that promise, no matter when you fulfill it.”</p><p>
  Ukyo  nodded.  Tao-Ching cleared his  throat.  “So Ukyo, you ready to give that  toy a proper welcome?”</p><p>
  Ukyo  gripped the haft of her weapon and smiled.   “It’s a guan dao, Tao-Ching, and yes, I think the <em>Wrathseeker</em> and I want to play.</p>
<p>* *  * * * </p>
<p>Ukyo  stood on the edge of the small field and slowly twirled her blade staff.  It moved easily in her hand, naturally.  The long ribbon twirled behind it in a spiral  as she waited for Tao-Ching to make the first move.</p><p>
  He  came, an overhand blow that she sidestepped, and she twisted the staff in her  hand to cut towards his back, smiling as he ducked under it and responded with  a kick at her ankle that she avoided by vaulting over him.  Her fingers loosened slightly as she landed  and the haft slid through them until she had the larger section of the  counterweight in her hand, and she thrust, forcing him to alter his charge into  a block as he realized she had almost fourteen feet of reach.</p><p>
  “Tricky.  Good.”   He said through a wide grin, his fangs showing as he licked his  lips.  “Let’s pick up the pace shall we?”</p><p>
  Ukyo  laughed as she flipped aside from the sweeping cut, then swung the staff behind  her back to block the following slash.   She placed the point of the blade against the ground as she launched  herself upwards, doing a handstand on the very end of the staff before she used  her momentum to snap the blade over and down.</p><p>
  Tao-Ching  caught it on the flat of his blade.   “Nice move.  You looked like Seung  Mina from Soulcaliber with that one.  My mom  is the Amazon’s Guan Dao master.  She’d  say you were showing promise.”</p><p>
  Ukyo  smiled.  “You ain’t seen nothing yet,  sugar.” she said smugly as her ribbon wrapped around his feet and she pulled  them out from under him.</p><p>
  Tao-Ching  turned the fall into a roll and came up blocking her multiple thrust assault,  his zanbatou ringing as it absorbed the impacts.</p><p>
  As  they stepped back to circle each other, Tao-Ching grinned in savage joy.  “Okay, warm up’s over.  Ready to get serious?”</p><p>
  Ukyo  grounded her guan dao and leaned it on her shoulder as she cracked her knuckles  and shook her body to loosen her joints.   Then she resumed a stance.  “How serious  you want to get, sugar?”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching’s  head lowered as his eyes glittered and he began to glow a soft green.  “Let’s see how good you <em>really</em> are.”</p><p>
  Ukyo  smiled too as she was surrounded by a neon blue aura.  “Yeah, I like that idea.”</p>
<p>* *  * * *</p>
<p>Rei  emerged from the tent to see Ukyo and Tao-Ching sparring, and she smiled.  It looked like Ukyo had gotten her new  weapon.</p><p>
  She  joined Nabiki to watch as Ukyo and Tao-Ching started to glow, and her jaw  dropped.  “What’s going on?”</p><p>
  Totosai  was watching as well.  “I believe we are  about to witness two masters of their craft display their finest arts.”</p><p>
  She  watched as the auras around the two grew brighter, and the wind around the  field began to blow inward towards the two warriors, then she blinked as the  stony ground around them began to crack and small stones began to rise.  Even Inuyasha whistled.  </p><p>
  “Man,  that’s some battle aura.”</p><p>
  Totosai  nodded.  “And neither of them have their  true weapons either.  Watch  Inuyasha.  Watch and learn.”</p><p>
  With  a roar almost like his smilodons’, Tao-Ching moved, his blade blurring.</p><p>
  But  Ukyo blurred too, and she matched him thrust and parry.  Her guan dao shone with a clear blue light,  and rang like a bell as it countered the glowing green zanbatou.</p><p>
  Then  she got in a kick that sent Tao-Ching flying thirty feet, but he twisted in mid  air and landed catlike on his feet, launching himself back instantly, the rock  under him shattering with the strength of his kick.  Ukyo caught his attack on her staff, the  ground under her crumbling as she absorbed the force of his blow, and then  threw him into the sky, launching herself after him.</p><p>
  Rei  watched as they clashed in midair, both seemingly as comfortable in the sky as  on the ground, and knew she was watching as Ukyo gave in to her memories.  Ukyo Kuonji, the combat okonomiyaki chef, had  surrendered her fight against Lady Orihime and resumed her role as the Dragon’s  Guardian.  She had known it last night,  when Ukyo had called her “Lady Phoenix”. She had accepted at least that part of  her destiny, as Rei had once had to do to fight Beryl.</p><p>
  She  had known it was coming from the moment she had seen her Phoenix on Ukyo’s back… so close, yet so far  away…</p><p>
  And  she knew, she truly knew, how Akane felt.</p><p>
  She  sighed, and watched as Ukyo - who like Zhu Shu would never be <em>her</em> Ukyo, but who would always be in her  heart - took one more step towards becoming who she had once been, and realized  that she was finally at peace with giving Zhu Shu to the chef.</p><p>
  Because,  in the end, she was <em>losing</em> nothing.  Though her destiny might lay on  a different path, it would <em>alway</em>s be  intertwined with them both.  If she was  to be the means by which Ukyo overcame her reluctance to love Zhu Shu, then she  could only count it as a blessing from the Dragon.  As much as she wished it could be more, she  had Ying-Ying’s sad confirmation that it would never be.</p><p>
  She  smiled as she watched Ukyo move, enjoying her elegance of motion as she danced  amid the clouds of shattered rock the pair were making, and found herself  wishing that those damn wasps hadn’t interrupted yesterday.  Still, they had a long journey ahead of them,  and Rei was certain they would have another time alone.  Maybe by the time they had rescued Zhu Shu,  Ukyo might even be willing to go beyond kissing.  She so looked forward to feeling Ukyo’s lips  caressing hers and badly desired to show the chef the intensity of her own  desires.  Their kiss had woken such a  need inside her she hardly could contain herself, and she could only hope that  Ukyo would be willing to share that passion with her for what little time they  could be together.  She so envied her and  Zhu Shu for the soulbond that they shared, yet it was also what had drawn her  so completely to them both.  To be so  loved…</p><p>
  Beside  her, Nabiki noted the dreamy eyed look, and smiled.</p>
<p>* *  * * * </p>
<p>The  sparring match ended when Ukyo  disarmed Tao-Ching, sending him and his zanbatou spinning in opposite  directions when she had descended in front of him, driving her weapon into the  ground in a pulse of ki that exploded into a massive shock wave as she  hit.  He picked himself up from the edge  of the thirty foot wide crater, dusted himself off, and bowed.  “Not bad, not bad at all.  You’d probably give my mom a run for her  money.”  He walked over to his sword as  Ukyo climbed out of the crater, then joined her.  “Mind if I take a closer look?”</p><p>
  Ukyo smiled as she tossed the <em>Wrathseeker</em> to him and gratefully took the towel Rei held out for  her to wipe the sweat off of her face.    “We’d both probably have lasted longer if we weren’t rusty.”  She chuckled.   “Last time I held a guan dao seems like a lifetime ago.”</p><p>
  Rei  giggled along with Ukyo as Tao-Ching nodded.   “Yeah.  I was stupid and let the  teasing of my buddies in the JSDF get to me and put it away for three  years.  I’d almost forgotten how good it  feels to use the weapon I spent so many years perfecting my skills at.  While a gun is quick and effective, and my  hand to hand is nearly as good as your average female warriors, it’s just not  the same.  I really wonder what might  have happened had I chosen to continue my training and met Herb with three  years more skill than I had when I first fought him.  I lost mainly because it was three to two.”</p><p>
  Nabiki  raised an eyebrow.  “What exactly  happened when you went to fetch the <em>Kaisufuu</em> anyway, Tao-baby?  You never did tell me that story.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching  shrugged.  “Lo Shen and Ke Lun wouldn’t  have approved of my tactics.  I shot Herb  in the head with armor piercing rounds.   She’s a skeleton on the bottom of Tokyo Bay.”  He shrugged.   “I would have liked to have collected her armor as proof, but the sharks  were a bit thick.  I’ll have to go scuba  diving one of these days and see if I can find it.”</p><p>
  Nabiki  blinked.  “Wow, hun, you can be downright  evil when you want to be.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching  grinned as he gave the <em>Wrathseeker</em> a  few twirls.  “I’m an Amazon,  Nabi-chan.  When necessary, we kill, and  we always settle our debts.”  He nodded  as he handed the blade staff back to Ukyo.  “Nice.   I would have thought that the blade being off center like that would  make it a little awkward, but the cutouts lighten it and the upswept point  actually brings the blade’s center of balance back to midline.  That thing’s as much an axe as it is a  spear.”</p><p>
  Ukyo nodded.  “The  cutouts can also be used to snare an enemies weapon to disarm him, or to break  his weapon, and the curve gives it tremendous cutting power.  The <em>Wrath</em> itself is more ornamented, with dragons etched and silver plated on either side  of the blade, and a gold leaf dragon wrapping the length of the staff, against  crimson lacquer.  Then there’s the armor  that it summons…”  Ukyo  blushed.  “I have a sneaking suspicion  that it was designed by a hentai video game designer.  It’s a bit, um… risqué.  Totosai says it is magical, and despite the,  um, lack of substantiality, it is impervious to ordinary weapons.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching  raised an eyebrow.  “The <em>Wrath</em>?”</p><p>
  Ukyo  shrugged and jerked a thumb at her back.   “The <em>Dragon’s Wrath</em>.  My true weapon, from my previous life.”</p><p>
  “Ah.  Yeah, I remember Zhu Shu’s the reincarnation  of the Dragon Empress, I didn’t know you were a reincarnation too.”</p><p>
  Ukyo  sighed and leaned on the <em>Wrathseeker</em>.  “Yeah.   I used to be Lady Orihime, the Dragon’s Guardian.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching  laughed.  “<em>YOU’RE</em> Lady Orihime? Oh man, you have <em>got</em> to meet my mother now.   I’ve spent my life hearing her stories of Lady Orihime, the ancient hero  who has been her idol since she was a little girl.”</p><p>
  Ukyo  raised her eyes to heaven as she pleaded to the Dragon to please spare her from  ever having such a meeting…</p>
<p>* *  * * * </p>
<p>The  school day passed uneventfully, though Akane was starting to wonder if Kodachi  had finally given up on her.  She had  been missing ever since the night at the Club, and Akane could have sworn she  had seen Sasuke hovering around the school entrance that morning anxiously  looking for her.  Annoying as she was,  Akane still hoped she was just off sulking and not in some sort of real  trouble.  </p><p>
  After  school, she had called the Kuno mansion, but there had been no answer.  She let it ring for three minutes before  shrugging and going into the dojo to teach the girls.</p><p>
  She’d  put it out of her mind by the time Luna and Artemis came into the dojo just as  practice was ending.  Out of the corner  of her eye, she noticed Ranma start as she saw the felines, then recognition  set in and she relaxed.  Akane raised an  eyebrow as she thought, <em>Interesting.  </em></p><p>
  “Hiya  Luna, what’s up?” Usagi asked as she wiped her face off with a towel.  “You just missed me actually getting a  compliment from Ranma on my kick!” the blonde girl beamed.</p><p>
  “Don’t  let it go to your head, Usagi.  I said  you did <em>one</em> kick perfectly.  You still need work to be consistent.” the  red head grumbled.  “You’re acting like  you’re afraid to actually follow through on the kick because you’re afraid someone  might see your panties.”</p><p>
  The  odangoed girl blushed. </p><p>
  Shan  Pu chuckled.  “If is true, Shan Pu can  fix.  Make train way Zhu Shu do.”</p><p>
  Mina  chuckled.  “I can just see that.  All of us doing kata in the nude.”</p><p>
  Akane  shrugged.  “If that’s what it takes.  Modesty has no place in combat.  Particularly when your life is on the line.”</p><p>
  Usagi  blushed harder.  “But – but Ranma is a  boy!”</p><p>
  Akane  gave her a level look.  “Not at the  moment she isn’t.  And that’s beside the  point.  You can’t afford to be  embarrassed when you’re fighting a youma.   That thing I fought might not have been much of a threat, but she was  seriously trying to kill me. So, tomorrow, you all better bring gym shorts and  bikini tops.  I’m forbidding you gi as of  now.  And if you keep it up, I <em>will</em> make it nude practice.”</p><p>
  Ami  blushed as well, while Mina and Makoto chuckled.  “This should be fun,” Makoto said to the  blonde.</p><p>
  Mina  gave her a grin.  “I wonder if our  princess can do it.”</p><p>
  “You’re  all picking on me!” Usagi wailed.</p><p>
  Ami  put a hand on her arm.  “Really they  aren’t Usagi-chan.  I’m embarrassed too,  but Akane is right.  I’ve been studying  martial arts books and watched some of the professional video tapes.  None of the female fighters who’ve been  champs seem to worry about their modesty during a fight.  It’s something we should try to overcome.”</p><p>
  Artemis  chuckled.  “That’s never seemed to have  been a problem with Minako.  But, if I  may interrupt this amusing discussion? We’ve come to speak to all of the  Senshi.”</p><p>
  Akane  nodded.  Ranma looked to Shan Pu and back  at the white cat.  “You want us to duck  out?”</p><p>
  Artemis  sat on his hindquarters and shook his head.   “Not necessary.  In fact I want to  thank you and Akane and Shan Pu for training everyone.  Because of that, Luna and I have been working  on something to help out too.”</p><p>
  Luna  went to the dojo door and dragged in a large pouch.  She nosed it open and pulled out five wands  and six watches, each marked with a symbol for one of the Senshi.</p><p>
  “Artemis  and I have been fine tuning things using the records Ami’s been making and  we’ve made new wands and communication watches for each of you.  These new wands have been calibrated to your  new power levels, and should enable all of you to be stronger than the previous  ones.”</p><p>
  Akane  blinked as she reached out to touch the one that had a plain circle around a  dot, the symbol for Earth.  “This one is  mine I take it?”</p><p>
  Luna  nodded.  “It’s calibrated to you directly  instead of to Zhu Shu, so it shouldn’t have any weird side effects like what  the other one did to your hair.”</p><p>
  Akane  laughed.  “I’m not complaining.  I like it, and apparently so does Shan  Pu.  She’s been washing it for me every  bath, and rebraiding it every morning.”</p><p>
  The  catgirl giggled.  “Shan Pu like run  fingers through Ai Ren hair, nyah.”  Then  she frowned.  “New pen still give same  outfit, yes nyah?”</p><p>
  Artemis  nodded.  “Yes, we didn’t modify the  designs, just boosted the effectiveness.”</p><p>
  Usagi  pouted.  “Poor Rei isn’t going to be able  to use hers for a while.”  Then she did a  double take.  “Hey, there’s only a watch  for me?”</p><p>
  Luna  sighed.  “Your locket has the Ginzishou,  Usagi.  How are we supposed to upgrade  that?”</p><p>
  “Oh,  yeah.  Cool.  Wow.”   She smiled.  “We should  celebrate!  Let’s go get ice cream!”</p><p>
  Makoto  laughed.  “That’s our princess.  Always thinking with her stomach.”</p><p>
  Ranma  laughed.  “Well, she’s right.  I’ll even treat.  We’ve been making tips like mad at the club,  and I want to relax before work.”</p><p>
  Akane  gave her a sidelong glance.  “You just  want ice cream.”</p><p>
  Ranma  gave her a grin.  “Of course I do.  I like being able to order anything I like  and not having to be embarrassed to eat it.”</p><p>
  “It’s  a wonder you haven’t turned into ice cream, you eat so much of it.”</p><p>
  Shan  Pu giggled.  “If Ai Ren do, it just  excuse for Shan Pu eat. Myuu!”</p><p>
  Ranma  blushed to her neckline as Akane laughed.</p>
<p>* *  * * *</p>
<p>Konatsu  watched wide eyed as Lo Shen sat back and gave Ying-Ying a small frown.</p><p>
  “Well,  this will make things a little more difficult.   I can’t get a clear connection to you to examine you.  Must be because you lack a body to anchor  your soul, so you’re just pure spiritual essence.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  lowered her eyes.  “I am sorry,  Loremistress.”</p><p>
  “It  just means I’m going to have to question you, and please be as precise as  possible, because I need to know what you still have to learn.  First, who’s been teaching you magic?  Ke Lun said no-one in Zhu Shu’s village was a  mage.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  shook her head.  “I have been Legend’s  apprentice for the last four years.  He  said he could have simply given me the skills of a master mage, but he has been  insistent that I try to live as close to life as I could.  My return to the mortal world has been  stranger for me than my existence in the spirit realm due to my  intangibility.  I may not have had to  sleep in the spirit realm, but in my little place I was quite physical and  retained physical sensations such as hunger and thirst, so I have a kitchen and  the various accoutrements of my life, and have learned how to cook quite well  out of simple boredom.  In many ways, my  life as a spirit has been identical to the life I had before I died.”</p><p>
  Lo  Shen raised an eyebrow.  “I see.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  nodded.  “In the same manner, Legend has  trained me as any apprentice in the mortal realm has been trained.  I have learned meditation, shielding,  centering, basic scrying, and much about healing the mind and body.  Primarily I have learned the various magics  of the mind, mostly communication, empathic as well as telepathic, and of  course telekinesis.  I have also studied  the art of dreamweaving.  Of the physical  magics, I have studied little beyond basic alchemy and herbalism - mainly  healing medicines.  I have also done much  reading about the modern art of medicine with particular interest in the  science of psychology.”</p><p>
  Lo  Shen nodded.  “Interesting.  So Legend has trained you primarily in the  physician’s arts, the skills that suit a priestess of a peaceful deity.  I really should have known that already, <em>Lady</em> Ying-Ying,” she said with a rueful  smile.</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  blushed.  “Legend would be the first to  tell you that he is no god, just an embodiment of the forces which shape all  things.  He tends to get embarrassed when  people call him a deity, or pray to him.”</p><p>
  Lo  Shen laughed.  “I like him already.  Wish more of the supernaturals thought like  that.  Too many deities have egos that  far outstrip their powers.” </p><p>
  “Legend  has very little ego, Sensei.  While it is  true I am essentially similar to a priestess fulfilling the desires of my  deity, Legend does not desire worship, nor do I have any duties beyond those of  being his representative and guarding my soulmates as best I may.  In this alone has Legend granted unto me any  innate powers and abilities, and even I am unaware as to the extent of them.”</p><p>
  Lo  Shen nodded.  “Fair enough,” she said as  she stood.  “Alright, you two stay here,  I have to go and collect a few books and materials.  I believe I brought a few primers that I can  let you go over to see what you already know and we can go from there.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  bowed as the bunnygirl mage slid closed the door to the room.  Then she turned as she felt Konatsu’s hand  brush through her arm.</p><p>
  “I  am confused,” Konatsu’s emerald eyes blinked.   “Who is this ‘Legend’ you speak of?”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  laughed.  “Legend is the name the Dragon  has chosen for himself.  He says he got  tired of always being referred to as ‘The Dragon of Legend’ by a western mage  once known as Merlin.”</p><p>
  “You  speak of the Dragon as if you have met him.”</p><p>
  “Indeed,  I have bided in a place of his making for the four years since my death,  watching over his daughter, Zhu Shu.  He  is my teacher, and I spoke to him only days ago.”</p><p>
  “Is  not the Dragon an ultimate being? The ruler of all gods?  I had thought that was why he alone was the  patron of the true line of the Imperial Dynasty.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  shook her head.  “He is beyond our  comprehension, my love, but he is as much a part of our greater universe as you  or I.  He rules no-one and commands  nothing.  He merely is.  He is a manifestation of the forces of the  universe, the force which seeks balance in all things, just as Chaos is that  principle which seeks to undo balance and force everything to an absolute, be  it absolute order or absolute anarchy.   Legend is Unity, where Chaos is Division.”</p><p>
  “But  you have called Zhu Shu the Daughter of the Dragon, the true heir of the  Imperial Line, and the heir to the powers of the Empress Lin Tzu.  If he is not a god, what does that mean?  Is it but an empty title?”</p><p>
  “It  means exactly what it says, Ko-chan.   That she is Legend’s child.  And  as such, she is tied to the primal forces which underlie our reality.  In this, she is no different than any other sentient  being, save that her abilities to shape the world around her are as much  instinctual as they are learned.  As Lo  Shen has learned to affect the reality we live in by force of will, so can Zhu  Shu.  The only difference is that for Zhu  Shu, what would take Lo Shen a mighty effort, much knowledge, and great force  of will to accomplish, she could do by instinct alone.”</p><p>
  “So  she <em>is</em> more powerful.  More than <em>merely</em> human.” Konatsu said decisively, nodding.</p><p>
  “No.  She is not.   She is simply more <em>intuitive</em>.”   Ying-Ying sighed.  “It is that misperception which has caused  Clan Dragon so many troubles throughout the centuries since Lin Tzu first won  Legend’s love.  Sadly, it even caused the  rift which pitted Musk against the Dragon, and which set poor Clove on her mad  misguided quest to become the sole Daughter of the Dragon.  The powers of Lin Tzu, the Dragon’s Gift, as  it has been called, is the drop of Legend’s blood with which he made her his  child.  Through that gift, he made her a  part of himself, and all else came from that.   While it is true that Zhu Shu is not truely human, and that she has the  potential to wield the power of what we call a god, in this, she is no  different from <em>any</em> thinking creature  who understands that the world we inhabit is merely a shadow created by our  limited perceptions.  Even the spirit and  the mortal realms, from Earth to the Celestial and Infernal realms are but  shadows of the true reality.  The <em>only</em> universal truth is that we are all  simply patterns of coherent energy, from the tiniest subatomic particle to  Legend himself.  Only our level of  complexity changes.  It is our  perceptions of reality that confine us to our limited reality, and our ability  to change those perceptions which enable us to alter it.  Everyone has this ability, but few  understand, or use it.  All that Legend’s  blood has granted to his daughters is a wider perception.”</p><p>
  “Only  his daughters? Not the entire line of Lin Tzu?”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  laughed.  “It is even more limited than  that.  What the Dragon’s Blood inadvertently  did was make a very specific energy pattern overwhelmingly dominant.  Every Daughter of the Dragon save Clove has  been in essence an exact <em>copy</em> of Lin  Tzu.”</p><p>
  Konatsu  blinked.  “Why not Clove?”</p><p>
  “Because  Clove also bore the blood of a true dragon, and it’s magical nature merged with  that of Legend’s legacy.  Zhu Shu is the  reincarnated soul of Lin Tzu, reborn time and again, but Clove is <em>not</em> a copy.  She is more like her <em>sister</em>.”</p><p>
  The  kunoichi’s eyes were troubled.  “But what  of the Fang and the Talon?” Konatsu asked in bewilderment.  “The swords of power born by the Heir?”</p><p>
  “They  are swords crafted by a powerful wizard and empowered by an object of immense  mystical power, the Ginzishou.  That  imbued them with of a limited sense of self awareness.  In times of great need or of great danger,  they can act on their own to aid the Heir and use the various special abilities  they were crafted with, but their perceptions of our world are linked to the  Heir, and they may only act if called upon.   Their power is immense, and when they are coupled with her senshi  henshin, they are nearly a match for the Ginzishou in raw mystical strength,  though more limited in how they can use that power.”  </p><p>
  Konatsu  blinked several times as she digested that.   “So then why is being the Dragon’s Child so important?  Why would Xi’an Chi covet her so?”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  shook her head sadly.  “Because she is inherently  as much a part of the greater universe as she is part of the limited realm of  mortal existence.  And as such, she is  seen by him as a shortcut to power great enough to overthrow his mistress,  Chaos.  He believes that if he takes the  Blood of the Dragon for himself, he will become the most powerful god in  existence.  What he has never grasped is  that he chases an illusion.  He is already  as powerful as Lin Tzu ever was, due to his alliance with Chaos, and even were  he to take her link to Legend, it’s sole use would be to allow Chaos to strike  at Legend directly.  Xi’an Chi would gain  nothing from her death because Zhu Shu is no more powerful than <em>any</em> conscious being, from Legend on down  to the lowest thinking creature.  She <em>appears</em> more powerful solely because her  ability to manipulate the patterns of energy around her is subconscious.  Any mage, with sufficient will and mental  discipline, could equal her.  It is her  ability to instinctually manipulate energy that is her true strength.”</p><p>
  Konatsu  blinked, her green eyes looking stunned.   “But if that is true of any Daughter of the Dragon, wouldn’t that mean  that Clove is exactly the same?”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  nodded.  “She <em>was</em>, and <em>is</em>, just as much  Legend’s child as Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  “Yet  one is favored and the other hated.” Konatsu said bitterly.</p><p>
  “Not  by Legend, Ko-chan.  He loves Clove as  much as Zhu Shu.  It is merely the fact  that she has been set to do great harm to her sister by Hild that we guard  against her.  Hild brought her back and  set her to a task of pointless revenge for the ‘crime’ of saving the life of  Mara, a demon who loved Hild’s own daughter, and who was forced by Hild to work  for her love’s ruin.  Because Legend  chose to allow their love to flourish instead of being destroyed, Hild  resurrected Clove, and now she waits for her to kill Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  “But  did not Zhu Shu destroy the last of the Musk dynasty?  Does not Clove have a reason for revenge? A  right to seek it for the murderer of her family line?” Konatsu asked heatedly.</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  sighed as she shook her head. “Clove has been deceived, and tricked into  seeking vengeance.  Xi’an Chi seduced the  three sole survivors of the Musk, Herb, Lime and Mint, and set them to attack  the Amazon village.  Lime was slain  fighting against Tao-Ching.  His death  was a personal score between them, brought about by the hatred he bore his  enemy and that Tao-Ching bore towards him for his near death at the Musk’s hands.  Had Lime not attacked the Amazons, Tao-Ching  would not have had to carry out the blood vow he had made to kill Lime when  next they fought. Xi’an Chi killed Mint from hiding with a spell solely to  prevent the Loremistress from questioning him, and Clove was placed into the  body of Herb, who Hild herself killed solely to provide an empty vessel.  While it is true the Musk are no more, it was <em>Xi’an Chi </em>who set their destruction  in motion, just as he did so many years ago.   And he did so for precisely the same reason he had used them before, in  an attempt to possess the Dragon’s Child.”</p><p>
  Konatsu  looked down at her hands.  “By the gods…  So much tragedy… So much pointless death and destruction because of one  madman’s obsession.”  She trembled.  “If Clove is truly as much Legend’s daughter  as Zhu Shu, then why did Xi’an Chi kill her?   Why did he set her against the Clan of the Dragon?  Why not simply use <em>her</em> as he tries to do to Zhu Shu. Why did he toss her aside and  drown her?”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  laid her hand on Konatsu’s and gripped as tightly as her ghostly state would  allow.  “Because his obsession with the  descendants of Lin Tzu would not let him believe that Clove was a true heir of  the Dragon.  His sole objective was Song  Shi Wang’s young daughter.”  She sighed.  “I feel so sorry for Clove, because all her  life, both past and present, she has been used badly by those who have deceived  her.”</p><p>
  Konatsu’s  emerald eyes met Ying-Ying’s crystal blue ones.   “You – you do not hate her for being sent to kill Zhu Shu?” she asked in  surprise.</p><p>
  “I  cannot, Ko-chan.  She is Legend’s child,  and her life has been so filled with tragedy, misunderstandings, and  deceptions.  Between Xi’an Chi’s  manipulations of tensions between Musk, Dragon, and Joketsuzoku, her own  father’s greed and ambition, and the petty jealousies and rivalries of her  friends and peers, she never had a chance for happiness.  Legend hopes that with her rebirth, perhaps  that can be found for her at last.”</p><p>
  Konatsu  looked away and sighed.  “If she is  caught, she can hardly even expect mercy, can she?  Not after everything that has happened.  How can she find happiness?” she said  sadly.  “Even if she is shown the lies  she has been deceived by and regrets what she has done, she is doomed to be  despised and hated by those who have wronged her and who she has wronged.  All chance of happiness was lost long ago.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  reached out to touch her cheek and bring Konatsu’s eyes back to hers.  “It is true Ke Lun, and Lo Shen remember too  much of their past bitterness.  In time,  I have hopes they will let go the past and see the truth of their own  misperceptions.  And not everyone who yet  lives remembers Clove with anger and hate.   There are those who have already forgiven her for her sins.”</p><p>
  Konatsu  sighed as her head dropped and her bangs shadowed her eyes. “Even if there are,  she has bargained with the Queen of Hell.   Her life is forfeit should she fail in her quest.  She <em>must</em> kill Zhu Shu or Hild will take back the life she restored.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  raised Konatsu’s face with her hand to look her in the eyes again.  “And if Hild <em>tries</em>, she will have to <em>fight</em> for her.  On that, you have Legend’s  vow.”</p><p>
  Konatsu’s  breath caught as the ghost’s eyes swirled and liquid gold replaced the  crystalline blue.</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  gave her a toothy smile.  “At least for  now, Clove has found a safe place to <em>hide</em>.  Hopefully, she’ll stay there for awhile,  while Legend prepares.  If she comes out  of hiding too soon, saving her from Chaos might not be possible.  Things aren’t ready yet, because Legend never  expected Hild to resurrect her, but once they are, not all the forces of hell  itself will prevent Legend from reclaiming his lost child.” </p><p>
  Emerald  green eyes stared into ones of molten gold for a long moment before they slowly  faded to dark brown… </p><p>
  But  before they were gone, there was hope in them, and for the fleeting instant  that passed before Legend released her, Ying-Ying felt him smile.</p>
<p>* *  * * * </p>
<p>Since  Ranma had offered to buy, the girls all decided they wanted to check out this  new ice cream store they had passed on the bus to the dojo.  They had said there had been a big crowd, and  when they got there it was still pretty packed, so the girls all picked a table  on the outdoor patio as Akane and Ranma went to the window with their order.</p><p>
  “Man,  did they have to order the most expensive things on the menu?”  Ranma groused.</p><p>
  Akane  chuckled.  “You were the one who offered  to treat.  But don’t worry, I’ll chip in  too.”  She looked to where Shan Pu was  sitting with the other girls, her hands filled with two bundles of ecstatic  fur, and smiled.  “Trust a cat to know  exactly how to make another cat happy.  I  thought for sure those two were going to cry before Shan Pu volunteered to stay  at the table petting them.”</p><p>
  “They  were all three purring on the bus ride here.” Ranma chuckled.</p><p>
  “Speaking  of cats, I noticed you <em>almost</em> jumped  when they came in to the dojo earlier.”</p><p>
  Ranma  sighed.  “Yeah, I guess I’m not <em>totally</em> over being afraid of cats.  Regular cats still give me chills, but at  least it’s not the all out panic I used to have.  I actually managed to force myself to pet one  the other day.”  The red head  shrugged.  “Cats that I know are not  really cats, like those two and Tao-Ching, don’t seem to bother me at all  anymore.  It was just the <em>seeing</em> cats before <em>recognizing</em> them that made me start.”</p><p>
  Akane  smiled.  “That’s good.  If you can at least function around them,  maybe we won’t ever have to worry about you going into the Neko-ken again.”</p><p>
  “I  wouldn’t mind being able to <em>use</em> the  Neko-ken, Akane, if I could only not lose my mind doing it.”</p><p>
  Akane  shrugged, and watched a customer in line ahead of them pick up a particularly  delicious looking treat.  She eyed it  enviously as the guy walked away a short distance and took a huge lick.</p><p>
  And  she saw his aura flicker and dim slightly.</p><p>
  She  blinked, but as he took his next lick, it happened again.  It was a small difference, but she was  looking right at him as it happened.</p><p>
  “Akane?”  Ranma asked.  She held up her hand as she  looked for another customer.  This one  was a young girl holding her fathers hand as they each took an ice cream cone  from the counter girl.  Her aura was a  rosy pink.  Akane watched closely as she  smiled happily at the ice cream and thanked her dad for getting it.  </p><p>
  Then  she took a lick, and her aura flickered, she looked at her dad’s hand holding  hers in annoyance, and yanked it free.   Her father snorted and turned away from her as he took another bite.</p><p>
  She  looked around, and saw similar incidences occurring with every customer.  It was slight, but everyone who was eating  the ice cream had dimmed auras.</p><p>
  “Ranma,  there is something wrong with that ice cream,” she said quietly.</p><p>
  “Huh?”</p><p>
  “Everyone  who’s eating it.  Their auras are  dimming.  It’s like the ice cream is  sucking the energy out of them.”</p><p>
  “Say <em>what?</em>”  Ranma yelped.</p><p>
  “<em>Keep your voice down!</em>” Akane  hissed.  “You want to start a panic?  I’m telling you something is not right here.”</p><p>
  Her  eyes swept the crowd, trying to figure out what was going on.  Then she jerked her eyes back to the one  person who was also looking over the crowd.</p><p>
  And  smiling.</p><p>
  She  was tall, with white hair in a braid hanging over her shoulder, and her bangs  held back by another braid cleverly woven across her forehead.  It almost, but didn’t quite, cover the upside  down black crescent moon on her forehead.</p><p>
  “Ranma.  Go back to the girls.” She said very quietly,  barely moving her lips.  “Tell them that  there is someone from Blackmoon doing something nasty at this shop.  It’s not that Cooan person that attacked  Chibi-Usa, but I’ll bet she’s one of the ‘Four Phantom Sisters’.” </p><p>
  Ranma  suddenly went on high alert.  “Where?”  she said just as quietly, her eyes scanning without her head moving.</p><p>
  “That  white haired lady with the parasol.”</p><p>
  “Got  her.” She raised an eyebrow.  “So what’s  the plan?”</p><p>
  “Tell  Shan Pu and Makoto to hit the roof, and have Makoto henshin.  If she leaves, I’m going to try and follow  her until she’s someplace we can capture her.   They’re my back up.  You and the  others are going to hang out here, and when this place closes in a half hour,  go in and investigate.  I’m betting at  least one of those shop girls is another youma.”</p><p>
  “Why  not me and Shan Pu?”</p><p>
  “Because  I might need magical backing, and they might need physical.  This way we’ve got it covered both ways.”</p><p>
  Ranma  raised an eyebrow.  “You better watch  yourself.  I’m going to be pretty pissed  if you get hurt.”</p><p>
  Akane  kissed her on the cheek.  “Same to  you.  Now scoot, it looks like she’s  about to leave.”</p><p>
  Ranma  moved quickly, dodging out of the crowd without making a disturbance, and Akane  saw out of the corner of her eye as Shan Pu and Makoto nodded and did a quick  fade.  She was edging out of the crowd  herself when her quarry started to turn and walk down the street.</p><p>
  Blessing  Zhu Shu for the speed she had gained as part of their link, she blurred to the  roof, nodding to see Shan Pu was already following and Makoto had changed.</p><p>
  “Okay,  we’re going to try and take her.  We’re  going to have to do it unawares, because if she sees us, she’ll just  teleport.  We’ve got to take her out  first.  Once she’s unconscious, we keep  her that way and get her to the dojo.  Lo  Shen can probably keep her from teleporting away once we wake her up.”  She pulled out her wand as she talked.  “I’m going to be the one grabbing her.  You two keep me covered just in case.”</p><p>
  Shan  Pu frowned.  “Ai Ren not only quick one,  nyah!”</p><p>
  Akane  gave her a peck on the cheek.  “I know,  hun, but I <em>am</em> the fastest one  here.  And I’m a senshi.”</p><p>
  The  cat girl pouted.  “Shan Pu wanted in on  fun too, myuu.”</p><p>
  “You  will.  Next youma is yours, okay?”</p><p>
  Makoto  rolled her eyes.  “Man, you guys remind  me of me and my Sempai before Kodachi stole him.”  She nodded.   “I think she’s going for that alley up there.  Let’s intercept her.”</p><p>
  Akane  nodded and held up her wand.  “Earth Star  Power, <em>MAKE UP!</em>”</p>
<p>* *  * * * </p>
<p>Ranma  lay on the edge of the roof watching the store clerks and trying to figure out  which one was a youma.  She looked over  as Usagi wiggled up next to her, followed by Luna.</p><p>
  “Keep  your head down, you baka.  Those odango  stick up way too far.”</p><p>
  Usagi  fumed.  “If you’re going to be that way,  I’m not going to tell you the message we just got.” She tried to look  disdainful while Luna sighed.</p><p>
  “Akane  got the Blackmoon sister.”</p><p>
  “Huh,  hey how did you know that?”</p><p>
  Ranma  rolled her eyes.  “Because that’s what  she went to do, so what else would she call to say?  She’s not going to screw up something that  simple.”</p><p>
  The  blonde pouted.  “Are you saying that <em>I</em> would?”</p><p>
  Ranma  sighed.  The last thing they needed was  an argument to draw attention to them.   “It was a simple snatch and grab.   Too easy for <em>anyone</em> to screw  up.” <em>Except maybe you</em>, she thought,  unable to avoid the dig in her head.  She  pointed to the counter girl with long blue hair.  “I think that’s our youma.”</p><p>
  “Why  do you think that?”</p><p>
  “She’s  all business, and I mean <em>all </em>business.  The other two have been gossiping, but that  one just keeps serving.  She doesn’t talk  to the customers beyond getting their orders, and hasn’t even smiled at the few  guys who have flirted with her.  She’s a  regular ice maiden.”</p><p>
  “Mina  wants to go look and see if she can find a back door to that warehouse thingie  the shop fronts.”</p><p>
  “Not  a bad idea if you ask me.” Ranma said.   “But <em>you’re</em> their leader.  You make the decision,” she said  pointedly.  “I’m just your teacher, and  I’m strictly backup.”</p><p>
  Luna  looked at the red head in surprise and nodded approvingly.  Usagi stared at Ranma wide eyed as well, then  nodded and tried to put on a face she no doubt thought showed great resolution.  She wiggled away from the edge backwards, her  butt in the air as Ranma tried hard not to laugh.</p><p>
  By  the time the shop closed ten minutes later, Mina had indeed found an entrance,  and though Ranma thought she had been a bit reckless, she’d snooped inside and  found that there were several people in the large freezer, frozen in blocks of  ice.</p><p>
  Then  the youma found her, and Ranma sighed as she called for help.  “Okay girls, looks like we’re going in the  hard way.  When I take down the wall,  move in quick.”</p><p>
  Usagi  and Ami blinked at the small red-head, but moved quickly when she jumped down  and headed to the nearest wall of the shop, her red ki aura flaring as she  launched a flying kick at the concrete.   The wall shattered in a hole almost eight feet across as Ranma  penetrated, then she skidded on the icy floor inside, taking cover behind a  large crate as Sailor Moon and Mercury joined Venus on top of one of the larger  racks.</p><p>
  The  youma, who Ranma had indeed been right about, looked almost human.  She was dressed in a robe of traditional  design, and only the red eyeshadow she wore made her look sinister.  She had shielded her face from the flying  debris of the wall as they had come in, and now looked up at the three scouts  in annoyance.  “Who are you?”</p><p>
  Sailor  Moon struck a pose.  “I am the Pretty  Sailorsuited Solider of-”</p><p>
  “Never  mind.  Die!” the youma said as she pursed  her lips and blew.  The Scouts dodged as  a blast of icy cold wind froze the shelf they had been standing on.  They took cover behind another one as the  youma continued to blow a freezing blast at them.</p><p>
  “S-so-so  c-c-c-c-old!”  Mina stuttered.  “T-t-t-the N-n-n-north P-p-p-ole wa-wa-wasn’t  th-this cold!”</p><p>
  Ranma  huddled behind her box.  “Mercury!  She’s an <em>Ice</em> Maiden!” she shouted across at the shivering trio.  Ami looked at her and nodded.</p><p>
  Ranma  jumped.  “Yo, over here!”  She ducked under the icy blast the youma sent  her way, landing on her hands as she kicked the box she had hidden behind with  both feet.  It flew at the youma,  skidding across the ice, but she blew at it and froze it to the floor.</p><p>
  However,  it had bought Ami enough time to step out and call “Shine Aqua Illusion!”</p><p>
  The  youma screamed as a column of water formed around her, swirling like a tornado  for a second before it froze into solid ice.   Ranma nodded and dusted off her hands as she walked up to the frozen  monster.  “Good job.”  </p><p>
  Ami  blushed.  “Wow.  I like my new attack.”</p><p>
  Ranma  cracked her knuckles and smiled at the youma frozen in the ice.  The monster looked back at her angrily.  She chuckled.   “Ya know, I’m really annoyed at you for messing with the ice cream.  I was really looking forward to it.”</p><p>
  With  a loud ‘Kyaa’, she turned and snapped a kick at the ice column, shattering both  it and the youma inside.</p><p>
  “Hey!”  Sailor Moon called, her scepter in her hand.   “<em>I</em> was going to finish it  off!”</p><p>
  Ranma  put her face in her palm and shook her head.</p>
<p>* *  * * * </p>
<p>They  took a minute to make sure the frozen people in the cooler were recovering  before they all headed back the dojo to find Lo Shen and Ying-Ying looking over  the captured Blackmoon sister.</p><p>
  “So,  tell me what you see, Ying-Ying,” Lo Shen asked as Ranma and the remaining  girls entered the dojo.</p><p>
  The  pink haired ghost nodded and put her hands on the unconscious woman’s  temples.  “She has been touched by the  hand of one who has corrupted her mind.”   She shuddered.  “He has filled her  mind with hate and anger, and suppressed every emotion of kindness and love.”</p><p>
  Lo  Shen nodded.  “It’s a nasty spell, and an  old one.  Variations of it have been  around since the beginning of time, I imagine.   It’s been used countless times by warlords seeking to make the ‘perfect  army’, and none of them ever seem to realize that if they repress everything  but the negative emotions, they will end up with soldiers who have no loyalty,  no camaraderie, and no willingness to serve anyone they see as weaker than  themselves.  Their commander must be a  fairly powerful individual if they serve him without obvious rebellion.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  nodded.  “I sense a twisted form of  desire within her.  I think whoever  commands her has used her sexually, and made her crave him.”</p><p>
  Lo  Shen sighed.  “I think I hate those kind  worst of all.”</p><p>
  Akane,  still in her Sailor outfit, asked “Can you keep her from teleporting away if we  wake her to try and get some information?”</p><p>
  Lo  Shen chuckled.  “Of course I can, but  there’s little need of that.” Her hands sparkled as she placed it on the  woman’s forehead.  “Let’s see what kind  of memories your pretty little head holds, my dear.”</p><p>
  Long  moments passed as Lo Shen concentrated, then she frowned.  “You girls might as well relax.  Whoever did this to her has some skill.  I can break his spells, but it’s going to  take the rest of the night and probably tomorrow too.  I’ll call Ke Lun at the club and have her  call in the swing shift girls tonight.   If I break through early, I’ll let Akane know and she can call the rest  of you.”</p><p>
  Usagi  nodded, and wiped the back of her hand across her forehead.  “Thank the gods.  I’m bushed.”   She yawned as she stretched.</p><p>
  Lo  Shen laughed.  “Go home and do your  homework, princess. If nothing else, I should have her finished by the time you  all get here for practice.  I understand  you’ve been restricted to gym shorts and halter tops.  I’ll be sure to bring popcorn.”</p><p>
  Usagi  blushed as Mina and Makoto burst out laughing again before linking their arms  through the chagrined blonde’s, and leading her out.</p><p>
  Ami  stayed a moment.  “Lo Shen-sensei?  Do you mind if I stay?  I – I don’t know anything about magic, but  I’d like to take readings.”</p><p>
  Lo  Shen smiled.  “Don’t know magic,  humm.  High time you learned some then.  Why don’t you and Ying-Ying stay with me for  a bit, and I’ll give you a lesson.  A  scientific mind like yours should find this quite interesting.”  She turned to the trio of girls still  left.  “You’ll find Konatsu once again  polishing the floors to a high gloss.  Be  a dear and send her here too, please.”</p><p>
  Akane  tilted her head.  “Okay.  I wouldn’t think she’d be much help though.”</p><p>
  Lo  Shen gave a mysterious smile to Ying-Ying.   “I think that pretty little face hides a rather perceptive mind, my  dear.  Konatsu may not be terribly  bright, but I bet she has incredible <em>intuition</em>.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying  blushed brightly and looked a little worried.   Akane looked back and forth between the two, then shrugged as she turned  and left the dojo with Ranma and Shan Pu.</p><p>
  <em>I wonder what that was about.</em></p>
<p>* *  * * * </p>
<p>Ukyo  looked out over the cliff and sighed.  </p><p>
  It  had been a long day’s ride back to the exterminator’s village, which had been  on a direct line to the coast and the road they would have to take to reach the  Hasai domain, and she had spent the day mainly musing as she shared Tao-Ching’s  back with Nabiki.  She’d wished she could  have talked to Rei more, but the decision had been made that between Rei’s senshi  powers and Kagura’s abilities, they had made the best combo to provide air  cover, since Kirara had to walk tied to Tao-Ching if they didn’t want the  smilodon wandering off.  </p><p>
  She  couldn’t have said why the dream she’d had while suffering the wasp sting had  seemed to break down some sort of barrier in her, yet it had.  She’d reached at least a partial peace with  her past life, and while she still wasn’t sure about the concept of becoming a  complete lesbian, she had accepted something very important to both Orihime and  Ukyo.  She <em>was</em> Zhu Shu’s fiancée.  It  didn’t matter if it had been forced upon her by her dad, <em>she </em>had made a choice by forgiving Zhu Shu.  She had accepted Zhu Shu as the girl she was  going to marry.  By doing so, she had  made a commitment, one that had certain duties and obligations, one of which  was to defend her future wife.</p><p>
  She  had already accepted the role of Guardian of the Dragon.  She had accepted the moment she had seen Zhu  Shu in that mirror in the strange dream world they had shared, and had truly  admitted that she had a past life to both the dragon girl and herself. All the  dream had done was show her what being the Dragon’s Guardian meant, and showed  her that she had never been alone in questioning, and that her life was <em>not</em> an endless repeat.  Her memories of Lady Phoenix had let her know  that nothing was ever the same, and that <em>all</em> of their memories of the past were too fragmented to base the present on.  </p><p>
  It  was too bad Rei had been so tired after not getting enough sleep last  night.  It might have been fun to see  where kissing would have led to if they were uninterrupted.  Yes, she still wanted a boyfriend, but considering  how open Rei had been about her desires, and her certainty that Zhu Shu  wouldn’t mind her and Ukyo playing, she had spent most of the day contemplating  the beautiful miko, and if she was ready to take the next step and actually  share her body with a girl.  She had  tossed it back and forth in her head all day, thinking about her own responses  to Rei’s kiss, and most especially to Zhu Shu’s dancing, and had decided the  next time she and Rei had an opportunity, she was not going to hesitate.  </p><p>
  And  when she had rescued Zhu Shu…</p><p>
  A  whisper of noise behind her made her turn, and she found herself looking into  two bottomless black eyes.</p><p>
  “Z-Zhu  Shu?”</p><p>
  The  dragon girl gave a quiet hiss and drew back, and Ukyo noticed that she was on  all fours.  She crouched, looking at the  chef warily.</p><p>
  Ukyo  was very still, realizing that she was in great danger.  She knew from her dreams that something was  wrong with the dragon girl, and her current actions were merely confirming  it.  Whatever Naraku had done to her, she  was little more than a wild animal at the moment.  Whatever had prompted her to leave the castle  and find Ukyo, it had not been a conscious thought.</p><p>
  But  maybe it had been the still connected link, and maybe that would give her a  chance to bring her fiancée back from whatever dark hell Naraku had confined  her to.</p><p>
  She  made soothing noises as she tried hard to send comforting thoughts through the  link.  <em>&lt;&lt;It’s okay, Zhu Shu.  It’s  just me.  Just Ukyo.  I’m not a threat, I’m your fiancée.&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  The  dragon girl made a half step to the side, and mouthed Ukyo’s name.  She made a questioning noise.  Ukyo raised a hand, palm up, her fingers  outstretched.  “It’s me.  Ukyo.   Please.  We’ve been so worried  about you,” she said softly.</p><p>
  Zhu  Shu leaned towards her hand, sniffing.   As if forced through an immense barrier, she spoke.  “U-Uk…yo?”</p><p>
  Ukyo  nodded and made a small beckoning motion.   “Yes.  Ukyo.”  She leaned forwards herself, trying once more  to push through the link.  <em>&lt;&lt;Ukyo.  Your fiancée.   You love me…&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  The  dragon girl looked puzzled, and took a step closer, her face just inches from  Ukyo’s hand as she sniffed.  Ukyo took a  chance and reached forward just a little more to gently touch her cheek.  She repressed a small shudder as instead of  soft skin, she touched the silky smoothness of tiny scales.  But the dragon girl didn’t withdraw from her  touch.  Instead she closed her eyes and  made a small noise like a purr.</p><p>
  Emboldened,  Ukyo turned the touch into a soft caress, and smiled encouragingly as the  dragon girl took another step towards her, allowing her to stroke Zhu Shu’s  long ear and making her earring and chains chime softly.  Ukyo looked at them and smiled, remembering  their song during Zhu Shu’s Dance of the Veils.</p><p>
  “Uk…yo.”  </p><p>
  “Yes.  Ukyo.   We’ve been looking for you.  We  want to help you,” she said gently.  <em>&lt;&lt;Ukyo.  The one you love,&gt;&gt;</em> she thought as  she felt the tiniest of flutters at the back of her mind.</p><p>
  The  diminutive girl moved closer, nosing along Ukyo’s arm until she was sniffing  Ukyo’s breath.  Ukyo swallowed, realizing  that even with the fine coating of scales, Zhu Shu’s naked body was still a  sculpture of exquisite beauty.  The  dragon girl was purring audibly now, her eyes still closed as she smiled,  apparently enjoying the caress of Ukyo’s fingers.  Ukyo’s mind went back to the thoughts she had  been having just as Zhu Shu had appeared, and she came to a decision.</p><p>
  Ukyo  screwed up her nerve and leaned forward just a little, trying to remember how she  had kissed Rei yesterday, projecting through the link as hard as she could <em>&lt;&lt;Come back to me, Zhu Shu!&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  As  her lips met Zhu Shu’s, something seemed to unlock inside the little dragon  girl, and Ukyo’s eyes widened in shock as she felt the link tear open and she  found herself washed away in a wave of desire.</p><p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;UKYOUKYOUKYOUKYO&gt;&gt;</em> the link repeated over and over as Ukyo was bowled  over, the dragon girl’s strength pinning her to ground effortlessly as she  kissed Ukyo ferociously, the power of her chi pouring through Ukyo and making  her lose all control of her body.  She  lay helpless as the dragon girl shredded her clothes and left her naked, their  bodies pressed together as Zhu Shu’s mind poured pure raw lust through the  link, and Ukyo realized she was about to be raped, so intense was the dragon  girl’s desire.</p><p>
  She  sobbed, terrified, but she closed her eyes and thought <em>&lt;&lt;If this is what you need, Zhu Shu, then take me!  Take me and come back to yourself!!&gt;&gt;</em> She swallowed hard.  <em>&lt;&lt;If you need me this badly, I won’t fight you!  Just please, come back to me!&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  She  felt the dragon girl stiffen and she opened her eyes to find herself staring  into the horrified jade green eyes of Zhu Shu as she heard a strange voice over  the link.</p><p>
  &lt;&lt;<em>Controlling  you?  T’was it not the darkness in your  own soul which corrupted the Shikon shard I gave you?  The anger and despair you hid so deep  inside?  I may have used you, but I did  not give rise to the lust which made you rape Ukyo.&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  Zhu Shu sobbed, and in a choked voice whispered “What  have done?”  Shame made her eyes dark  pools of self loathing.  “Oh beloved  Ukyo… <em>WHAT HAVE DONE!</em>”</p><p>
  She sat up and screamed in utter despair, a long howl  of grief and loss, before she hurled herself over the cliff and vanished in the  darkness.</p><p>
  And as Ukyo turned to watch her go, sobbing as she  reached after the vanished dragongirl, her mind filled with the grief and shame  of her soulmate, she felt the link shut down once more…</p>
