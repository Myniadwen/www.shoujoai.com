<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 4 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/wildhorse-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Nabiki smirked as she watched the fianc&eacute;es complain about the various 
women that seemed to be being drawn to Ranma. It was all she could do to 
not roll on the floor laughing hysterically at the irony of Shampoo 
calling someone a purple-haired slut. As it was, she had to viciously 
pinch the back of her upper arm in an effort to keep commentary about 
pots, kettles, and the color black safely in her mouth.

It was going to be interesting to see their reaction in the next episode 
when, unless he manages to avoid it somehow, Ranma ends up in a 
compromising position with Rei. A small giggle escaped Nabiki&#39;s lips as 
she calculated the odds of Ranma NOT ending up in a compromising 
position with a girl. Experience had shown they were too long to 
consider.

The fathers had been amazingly silent, aside form the occasional 
outburst of indignation from Genma when his name was mentioned in a not 
very pleasant light and her father&#39;s occasional bouts of tears about the 
schools not being joined. Even Kasumi seemed to be intrigued by the show 
even though the original series was not to her liking.

As everyone settled down and returned from getting more tea or restroom 
visits, Nabiki mashed the play button.

(oO\O/Oo)

Misato entered Gendo&#39;s office to see the man sitting, as usual, behind 
his desk, hands bridged in front of his face as if he had never moved 
from that position since the last time she was in here. Coming to 
attention in front of the desk she waited for him to speak.

&quot;Captain Katsuragi reporting as ordered, Sir,&quot; Misato said after an 
uncomfortable silence.

She was afraid he might be asleep. It was hard to tell with the lighting 
and his glasses obscuring his eyes.

&quot;You and the Third Child are having difficulties,&quot; Gendo stated.

&quot;Well, maybe a little,&quot; Misato hedged. &quot;Nothing I can&#39;t handle, Sir.&quot;

&quot;You will refrain from causing the Third Child undue stress,&quot; Gendo 
commanded. &quot;I have little desire to be the source of my son&#39;s stress 
relief any more than is absolutely necessary.&quot;

Misato&#39;s mind boggled. Did the Commander just order her to make up with 
Ranma and ignore the fact that the boy refused to follow orders? More 
bizarre, did the Commander just acknowledge Ranma as his son? She stood, 
dumbfounded, for what could have been several minutes before she 
realized the Commander hadn&#39;t said anything else.

&quot;Um...yes, sir,&quot; Misato said. &quot;Was that all, Sir?&quot;

&quot;Yes, you may go,&quot; Gendo said, thankful that his typical sinister 
posture covered the fact that he couldn&#39;t move without wincing.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma sat in the grass on a hillside bordering the athletic field. He 
was currently watching the distant blue-haired girl as she too sat apart 
from her classmates in the girls swim class. She looked very alone as 
she sat on the pool deck leaning against the fence. There was an open 
area around her as if the other girls were afraid to get too close to 
her. Ranma&#39;s heart went out to her as he too was familiar with being 
shunned and unable to relate to other people.

&quot;Hey, Ranma, what&#39;s up?&quot; Toji said, flopping down beside the pigtailed 
martial artist.

&quot;Staring at the girls?&quot; Kensuke teased. &quot;Hey, you&#39;re watching Rei aren&#39;t 
you? Are you in loooove?&quot;

&quot;Nah, it ain&#39;t like that,&quot; Ranma said defensively. &quot;I just feel sorry 
for her. Look at how alone she is. My old man musta really fucked up her 
head. It pisses me off. It&#39;s like he tried to turn her into some sort of 
emotionless, order-following machine.&quot;

&quot;She is a really odd girl,&quot; Toji agreed. &quot;It&#39;s like she&#39;s there, but 
not. As if the world goes on around her without noticing she&#39;s there.&quot;

&quot;Well, she really needs a friend and I&#39;m gonna help her,&quot; Ranma vowed.

&quot;So Ranma, are you going to try out for any of the Athletic clubs?&quot; Toji 
asked.

Ranma gave him a wry look.

&quot;Do ya think it&#39;d be fair to everyone else?&quot; Ranma said with a smirk.

&quot;Maybe not, but who cares as long as we win?&quot; Toji grinned.

&quot;Too big a hassle,&quot; Ranma commented. &quot;I got bigger responsibilities like 
savin&#39; the world and stuff.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s that,&quot; Kensuke agreed. &quot;I wish I could pilot an Eva.&quot;

&quot;Ken, you&#39;re a real moron, you know that?&quot; Ranma laughed.

&quot;No kidding,&quot; Toji shuddered. &quot;After seeing what it was like for Ranma, 
I don&#39;t want any part of that shit. I&#39;m still having nightmares of 
hearing Ranma scream.&quot;

Ranma shot him a sympathetic look, knowing that the boy would be faced 
with just the situation he wanted no part of and it wasn&#39;t going to go 
well. Silently, Ranma vowed to try to make the outcome less unpleasant 
for the boy.

(oO\O/Oo)

Rei lay on her futon, as she most always did when not required to be at 
NERV or school. Her red eyes stared blankly at the dingy ceiling of her 
squalid apartment. Not that she noticed the fact that it was squalid. 
Such things were not worthy of her notice most times, but certainly now 
more than ever.

While her body seemed unnaturally inactive, lying very still with only 
the measured rise and fall of her breathing betraying that she was in 
fact alive, her mind was racing with thoughts and confusion. As she had 
many times since it happened, she was revisiting the fight between the 
Commander and his son, seeking to analyze the effect it had on her.

Her eidetic memory replayed what she had witnessed in detail. She 
recalled vividly how the two males had striven against each other and 
how the Commander&#39;s bare skin glistened with sweat as his wiry muscles 
rippled across his frame. As interesting as that was, her focus was 
drawn inexorably toward the younger Ikari. His fantastic speed and the 
fluid grace with which he moved fascinated her. More telling was the 
fact that he did not sweat, nor was he breathing heavily throughout the 
entire struggle. It was clear he was toying with the Commander, even 
though the older man had managed to land a few blows.

As she reviewed the pigtailed boy&#39;s actions, her body began to squirm 
slightly. Rei became aware that her memories were causing her to feel 
the same sensations that she felt while witnessing the fight. It was a 
pleasant sensation, but it was accompanied by a feeling of undefined 
need that she failed to understand.

&quot;Why do I feel this way?&quot; Rei asked softly, as she continued to 
visualize the younger Ikari in her mind&#39;s eye.

He was so powerful and fluid, almost god-like when in battle. Why did 
that affect her? Examining the sensations she was feeling, she found her 
breathing had quickened and she felt warmer than normal. She also felt a 
tingling feeling of what must have been anticipation in her abdomen and 
a moistness between her legs.

Of its own accord, her hand drifted over to the dampening area and 
touched it. Rei&#39;s body went rigid as she sucked a hissing breath between 
clenched teeth.

&quot;That was...pleasant,&quot; Rei said to herself a little shakily.

Images of a bare-chested Ranma drifted through her mind&#39;s eye as the 
hand returned to what it was doing.

(oO\O/Oo)

While Rei was stumbling across the age-old art of flying solo, a very 
different set of events was transpiring over at the Katsuragi Asylum. 
Currently, the chief cook and bottle-washer, Ranma Ikari, was preparing 
a feast the likes of which had never been witnessed in a Katsuragi home. 
While Ranma worked, Misato had been hiding in her bedroom, having 
secured a cooler filled with beer. She had only emerged for a trip to 
the bathroom to make room for more of the precious golden fluid.

That was until Ritsuko arrived. Now the dark-haired woman had been 
forced from her sanctuary by her fair-haired friend and was working on 
getting a drunk on of epic proportions. They were seated at the table 
making small talk when Ranma came in with dishes of food balanced on 
nearly every part of his body that could support them.

The food was laid out and the trio began to eat in silence.

&quot;Wow, Ranma, I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Ritsuko said in amazement. &quot;This is really 
good. If you get tired of living with Misato you can always come live 
with me.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Dr. Akagi, but I&#39;ll have to pass on that,&quot; Ranma chuckled. &quot;I 
know about your thing for c-c-c-furry demons from hell.&quot;

Ritsuko shot him a wry grin and continued eating. Before long the food 
was gone and the trio sat around the table letting their meal settle.

&quot;So I guess we need to talk,&quot; Ritsuko mentioned.

&quot;No, no,&quot; Misato waved off drunkenly. &quot;No need for that. Already taken 
care of. The Commander ordered me to make up with Ranma so he didn&#39;t 
have to be Ranma&#39;s source of stress relief. Whatever the hell that 
meant.&quot;

Ranma smirked and Ritsuko laughed merrily.

&quot;I guess being our star pilot and the Commander&#39;s son, he doesn&#39;t have 
to follow orders like the rest of us,&quot; Misato slurred with a touch of 
bitterness.

&quot;It&#39;s not that, Misato,&quot; Ritsuko giggled. &quot;It might interest you to know 
that Ranma, here, marched right into his father&#39;s office and bodily 
dragged him down to the gym for a &#39;sparring session&#39; to &#39;work off some 
stress&#39;. The Commander made a pretty good impression of a punching bag 
from what I saw. By the way, how are the family jewels there Ranma?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re good,&quot; Ranma said, blushing. &quot;I used my ki to protect them but 
it still hurt. I shoulda figured the old geezer would go for a cheap 
shot like that.&quot;

Misato was gaping at the pair as they casually discussed Ranma beating 
the snot out of NERV&#39;s commanding officer. Ritsuko looked at her and 
burst out laughing.

&quot;Really, Misato, are you trying to catch flies?&quot; Ritsuko teased.

&quot;You really beat up Commander Ikari?&quot; Misato said in disbelief.

&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t say &#39;beat up&#39;,&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;But he&#39;s gonna know I 
was there for the next few days.&quot;

&quot;You really don&#39;t have any respect for the command structure, do you?&quot; 
Misato said in amazement.

&quot;Hey, if ya wanted someone that would run around saluting you and 
following orders to the letter, ya shoulda hired a soldier,&quot; Ranma 
snapped. &quot;If ya want someone who can come in and kick ass, then I&#39;m your 
man. But you gotta let me do my job. Besides, it ain&#39;t like you ain&#39;t 
got your own issues with authority, little miss &#39;what-are-traffic-laws&#39;. 
So don&#39;t get all hypocritical with me.&quot;

&quot;Now Ranma,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;Misato is only upset because she cares. She 
doesn&#39;t want anything bad to happen to you and the only way she feels 
like she can protect you is if you follow her orders. And as for you, 
Misato,&quot; she said forestalling Misato&#39;s coming rant, &quot;Ranma is right. 
He&#39;s not a soldier. He&#39;s had tougher training than just about any 
soldier I&#39;ve ever met and like it or not, he&#39;s a brilliant fighter.&quot;

&quot;But he&#39;s just a kid,&quot; Misato argued.

&quot;Yes, he is,&quot; Ritsuko agreed. &quot;But he&#39;s also a kid that can beat the 
snot out of any soldier we&#39;ve got. He&#39;s also a damn fine Eva pilot and 
our best hope against the angels. Listen, we expect him to go out and 
fight like an adult, we can at least respect his judgment as we would an 
adult&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Look, Misato, like I said before,&quot; Ranma added, &quot;I don&#39;t mind followin&#39; 
your orders. I respect your talent as an officer. All I&#39;m askin&#39; is that 
you respect my assessment of a situation. I know what I&#39;m capable of far 
better than you do. You haven&#39;t even begun to see the full extent of 
what I can do.&quot;

&quot;But how can I do my job if I don&#39;t know what you are capable of,&quot; 
Misato demanded.

&quot;Why not ask me?&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you whether I can do somethin&#39; 
or not. Geez, Misato, I can change into a girl.&quot; Ranma gave her a wry 
smile dumped a glass of water on his head, triggering a quick gender 
change. &quot;I figure that means I can do just about anything, huh?&quot;

Something about the improbability of the scene suddenly hit Misato and 
she started to laugh hysterically. Ranma and Ritsuko soon joined her. 
After sharing a good laugh the three calmed down.

&quot;Okay, Ranma,&quot; Misato snickered. &quot;I guess you do have a point. Two at 
the moment.&quot;

&quot;Hey, the water was cold,&quot; Ranma said defensively, setting off another 
round of laughter.

&quot;Anyway, I promise I&#39;ll listen to your opinion, if you promise to follow 
orders,&quot; Misato offered.

&quot;Done,&quot; Ranma agreed.

&quot;Oh, before I forget, Ranma, could you drop this off to Rei tomorrow,&quot; 
Ritsuko asked, handing the redhead an ID card. &quot;Hers expired and I 
didn&#39;t get a chance to give her the new one today.&quot;

Ranma took the card and looked at it.

&quot;Aww, are you looking at Rei&#39;s picture?&quot; Misato teased drunkenly. 
&quot;Ranma&#39;s in love.&quot;

&quot;I hardly know her, Misato,&quot; Ranma said, blushing in spite of the fact 
that she knew that was coming. &quot;She just seems so distant, so out of 
touch with the world.&quot;

&quot;Rei&#39;s not very adept at living, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Ritsuko remarked.

&quot;She just needs a friend,&quot; Ranma observed. &quot;I&#39;m sure anybody would 
retreat from the world if they had to spend as much time with the old 
geezer as she has.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma stood before the door of Rei&#39;s apartment. It was every bit as bad 
as he expected it to be. From the flickering of the florescent lighting 
in the hallway, to the dirt, grime and trash, detritus of years, 
collected on the otherwise bare metal floor, it was definitely a slum of 
the first order. Ignoring the intercom/door chime on the wall, which he 
knew wouldn&#39;t work, he knocked on the door.

After a short wait, he knocked on the door again. Still receiving no 
response, Ranma decided to knock a bit harder, figuring maybe she hadn&#39;t 
heard him in the bathroom. No way in hell was he going in there. He 
remembered all too well what happened when Shinji entered this apartment 
the first time, so he pounded on the door in hopes that Rei would hear 
him.

Unfortunately for Ranma, while the building was sturdy and built to take 
the abuse of the post-Second Impact weather patterns, the door was not 
designed to hold up to what some would call, a super-powered martial 
artist, knocking on it in an aggressive fashion. With a groan of 
tortured metal, the door fell inward as it succumbed to years of metal 
fatigue and the incessant pounding applied to it by a young man that had 
no intention of entering that apartment without being invited by its, 
hopefully, fully-clothed occupant.

Ranma sweat-dropped as he watched the door fall away from his fist and 
crash loudly to the floor. Laughing nervously, his fist moved to scratch 
the base of his pigtail, as if guiltily fleeing the scene of the crime. 
His mind raced to think of what to do about this.

&quot;Great, Ranma, now what are ya gonna do?&quot; Ranma muttered to himself.

Well, there was no help for it. He would simply have to go in far enough 
to pick the door up and stuff it back in its frame. However, experience 
told him that as soon as he set foot across the threshold, the girl 
inside would appear before him sans clothing and things would 
be...awkward.

At least she wasn&#39;t Akane, Ranma consoled himself. If she was anything 
like the Tomboy, he&#39;d be a dead man as she crushed his skull with the 
mother of all mallets before he could even begin to explain. Even if he 
did get a chance to defend himself, she wouldn&#39;t have believed him 
anyway.

Sighing, Ranma set his jaw and stepped in.

&quot;It was not locked,&quot; a soft voice drifted to his ears as he leaned down 
to pick up the door. &quot;It was not necessary to remove the door from its 
hinges.&quot;

Unable to stop himself, Ranma&#39;s head slowly turned toward the source of 
the voice. As he had known would happen, the apartment&#39;s blue-haired 
occupant, and blue was her natural color, stood before him in all her 
glory. Ranma&#39;s eyes widened as he froze like a deer in the headlights.

She took a step toward him and Ranma, realizing he was staring, quickly 
spun around to face the opposite direction. Rei walked past him and 
picked up the door, sticking it back in the frame. Ranma watched with 
his peripheral vision as the otherworldly girl turned to move away from 
the door. She didn&#39;t notice the door began falling back in and was about 
to fall on her. Ranma quickly grabbed the girl and pulled her to him 
just before the door would have come crashing back down on her.

It was only then that the flaw in that plan occurred to him. That being 
that he was now holding a naked girl against his body. Looking down, 
more than half expecting to see a look of anger, he saw she was staring 
disconnectedly at his chest sporting a light blush on her cheeks that 
was all the more luminous because of her ultra-pale complexion.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; he said and quickly released her. He picked up the door and 
held it in the frame pounding his head on it.

Feeling a tap on his shoulder after a couple minutes of head pounding, 
he cautiously looked over to find Rei was fully clothed.

&quot;Could you please move?&quot; she asked in her emotionless monotone.

&quot;Oh, ah, yeah, right,&quot; Ranma stammered as he opened the door for her.

Rei walked through the opening leaving Ranma to try to get the door back 
in its frame from the outside. Getting it in place he turned to follow 
the quiet girl. Halfway down the hall, he sweat-dropped as he heard the 
door fall back to the floor, but kept going when Rei didn&#39;t pause in her 
movement.

(oO\O/Oo)

Rei was in a complete daze. She couldn&#39;t take her eyes off the boy 
sitting across from her during the entire train ride into NERV. The 
feeling of his body being pressed against her only added fuel to the 
fires of confusion within her. It had brought back the feeling she had 
been exploring last night that led to...whatever that was that she had 
done to herself. She didn&#39;t know what it was but it felt...VERY 
agreeable. She fully intended to research it later to find out just what 
had happened that left her feeling exhausted, but warm and satisfied at 
the same time. Whatever the effect was, it seemed to be caused by the 
chagrinned young man sitting across from her.

Stepping off the train, her thoughts continued to be consumed by her 
lack of understanding as she walked to the entrance of the Geo-front. 
Passing her ID card through the reader, nothing happened. She repeated 
the process twice more with the same result before another card was 
passed through it and the door opened.

Rei looked over to find the source of her confusion holding a card out 
to her.

&quot;Um...I came over to give you this,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I forgot about it in 
the confusion. Sorry.&quot;

Nodding, Rei took the card from him, noting the tingle when her fingers 
brushed his hand. The pair then entered the Geo-front and stepped onto 
an escalator.

&quot;Um...good luck today,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;Why?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Well, you&#39;re doing that reactivation test thing, ain&#39;t ya?&quot; Ranma said. 
&quot;I was just hoping that this time turned out better, you know, since the 
first time didn&#39;t go so good for you.&quot;

&quot;Why would it not go well?&quot; Rei asked. &quot;Do you not trust the Commander?&quot;

Ranma snorted behind her.

&quot;Trust a guy that sees me as a tool to be used and discarded when he 
doesn&#39;t need me anymore? Yeah, right. That ain&#39;t happenin&#39;,&quot; Ranma 
derided. &quot;You can get angry with me about it if you want, but I&#39;ve had 
more experience with people than you, and Gendo Ikari is not someone to 
trust.&quot;

This gave Rei pause. She did feel anger that the younger Ikari 
questioned the Commander&#39;s character, but he did have a point about 
having more experience with people than she did. This was clear when he 
had correctly predicted that she would feel anger at his words. Rei&#39;s 
confusion grew by an order of magnitude.

Further thoughts were interrupted when the pair heard a muffled curse 
and a cascade of water shot over the side of a mezzanine above them, 
thoroughly soaking Ranma and activating his change of gender.

&quot;Great,&quot; the now busty redhead grumbled. &quot;Just great.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; a janitor called over the railing. &quot;I accidentally spilled the 
mop bucket.&quot;

&quot;Great. Just great,&quot; Ranma repeated as she looked down at herself, 
covered in dirty mop water.

Rei didn&#39;t understand why, but she felt the corners of her mouth twitch 
up into a small smile.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma entered the control room looking over the large room that 
currently contained Eva Unit 00. Stepping up to the window beside Gendo, 
he glanced over at the older man.

&quot;Hey, Pop. Feelin&#39; any better?&quot; Ranma asked solicitously, before 
reaching over and companionable patting his &#39;father&#39; on a bruised area.

Gendo flinched and made a small grunt before looking darkly at the 
younger Ikari.

&quot;I am quite well, Third Child,&quot; Gendo said.

Ranma chuckled as he saw the old fart&#39;s jaw clench.

&quot;You realize,&quot; Ranma said soberly, &quot;that if Rei gets hurt again that 
we&#39;ll be having another sparring session, right?&quot;

&quot;She will not be harmed,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;I am certain that this activation 
will be successful.&quot;

&quot;I hope so, &#39;cause she deserves better to be in constant traction,&quot; 
Ranma said, though he couldn&#39;t remember exactly how this part went. 
&quot;What you did to her is even more fucked up than what you did to me. I 
gotta hand it to ya, Pop; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a low you won&#39;t sink to 
in your master plan to take over the world and stuff.&quot;

&quot;You would do well to keep that in mind, Third Child,&quot; Gendo said 
darkly.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Ranma chuckled, dismissing the veiled threat as the Ikari men 
watched Rei&#39;s entry plug being inserted into Unit 00.

&quot;Activation commencing,&quot; Dr. Akagi announced.

Techs, monitoring the various systems, began to call out status reports 
as the systems were powered up and nerve connections were made. Everyone 
in the room tensed as the tech monitoring Rei&#39;s sync ratio reported that 
she was approaching the threshold.

&quot;Threshold reached. Synchronization Ratio continuing to climb,&quot; the tech 
reported.

&quot;All systems are functioning normally,&quot; Maya Ibiki, Dr. Akagi&#39;s prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
reported. &quot;Activation has been achieved. No anomalies.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;Prepare to release the locks and begin the 
testing.&quot;

Suddenly alarms began sounding. At first Ranma thought something had 
gone wrong with the Rei&#39;s activation, but then an announcement over the 
PA allayed those fears.

&quot;Pattern Blue Detected,&quot; a male voice said. &quot;We have an angel moving 
into the city.&quot;

&quot;Cancel the testing and prepare Unit 01 for launch,&quot; Gendo commanded.

Ranma nodded and took off to the locker room to get into his plug suit 
while trying to figure out why he didn&#39;t remember this part. As he 
struggled into the suit, it occurred to him that this was the episode he 
missed the last part of because Akane had malleted him into the canal 
after he made a comment about Shinji being lucky that Rei wasn&#39;t an 
uncute tomboy or he&#39;d have been malleted to death after the scene in 
Rei&#39;s apartment.

Shrugging, he mashed the button in the wrist of the suit causing it to 
suck in tightly against his body and headed for his Eva. It would have 
been helpful to know what went wrong that caused Shinji to wake up in 
the hospital bed in the next episode, but Ranma was sure he could handle 
it.

He hoped so because Rei was nearly killed protecting Shinji in that 
episode.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Wild Horse, ready,&quot; Ranma grinned as he announced his status.

&quot;Wild Horse?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;Sure, why not?&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;I&#39;m a pilot, ain&#39;t I? All Pilot&#39;s got 
clever callsigns. Mine&#39;s Wild Horse.&quot;

&quot;Okay &#39;Wild Horse&#39;,&quot; Misato shook her head. &quot;Eva launch!&quot;

&quot;WOOOOHOOOOOO!&quot; Ranma&#39;s voice was heard as the purple Eva went rocketing 
toward the surface.

The external monitors showed the catapult catch arms extend and Unit 01 
shoot up into them.

&quot;Ma&#39;am we have a power build up coming from the angel,&quot; one of the techs 
reported. &quot;It appears to be some kind of really powerful particle beam.&quot;

&quot;Ranma! Move!&quot; Misato yelled to the pigtailed pilot.

&quot;I can&#39;t, Misato!&quot; Ranma yelled back.

&quot;Ma&#39;am there&#39;s a problem with the transport locks! They&#39;re not 
releasing!&quot; another tech reported urgently.

It was then that the angel fired its weapon, blowing through two 
buildings before it struck Ranma&#39;s Eva squarely in the chest. Ranma 
could do nothing but scream as the beam began to burn a hole through the 
Eva&#39;s chest armor.

&quot;Temperature in the entry plug rising!&quot; A tech shouted over the 
screaming coming from the comm.

&quot;Brain wave patterns erratic! Sync Ratio fluctuating!&quot; another tech 
announced.

&quot;Retract Unit 01! GET HIM BACK DOWN HERE!&quot; Misato screamed.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma was unconscious by the time they had retrieved Eva Unit 01 and 
ejected the entry plug, but his vital signs were stable. Reviewing the 
data, Ritsuko remarked that it could have been a lot worse had it been 
anyone but Ranma. The pigtailed pilot had used his own massive store of 
ki to bolster the Eva&#39;s AT field and thus avoided a portion of the 
damage that could have been received. The blonde scientist determined 
that someone less durable than Ranma would have almost certainly went 
into cardiac arrest due to the feedback generated from the Eva having a 
hole burned in its chest.

As for the angel, it had moved into position directly above Central 
Dogma and extended a massive drill bit. It began drilling through the 22 
layers of armor while the NERV command staff tried to come up with a 
plan. Analysis indicated that they had 10 hrs before the angel 
penetrated the Geo-front armor.

First they tried conventional weapon systems, everything from tanks to 
massive railway guns. Nothing scratched the angel and everything that 
they attacked it with was instantly fired on and destroyed by the 
angel&#39;s counter fire. The octahedron-shaped angel seemed perfect 
offensively and defensively.

Failing to mount any sort of effective offensive, they then tried to 
determine the angel&#39;s threat detection range. Using various Eva 
mock-ups, they were deployed around the city and out in the bay. Each 
one was quickly destroyed by the angel until they determined the maximum 
distance that would provoke the angel to attack.

In the end it was Misato who came up with a daring plan. She had heard 
reports that the JSSDF was working on a new weapon, a Positron Laser. It 
was untested and its power requirements were ridiculously large. To 
power it, they would need every bit of power generated across all of 
Japan but it was the best hope they had.

&quot;This is the best you can do?&quot; Fuyutsuki demanded.

&quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; Misato said. &quot;I&#39;ve run the simulations on the Magi and this 
plan had the highest success rate.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;Proceed with the plan.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; Misato replied and left the room.

&quot;Do you honestly think this will work?&quot; Fuyutsuki asked the elder Ikari.

&quot;It had better work,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;We don&#39;t have many other options.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;This is it?&quot; Misato asked as she looked at the massive piece of 
equipment.

&quot;Yes, this is the Positron Laser, the most powerful weapon ever built,&quot; 
the project engineer said proudly. &quot;We should be ready to begin testing 
it soon. The problem is the power requirements.&quot;

&quot;Alright Rei, load it up!&quot; Misato called into her comm unit.

&quot;Huh?&quot; the engineer said dumbly. &quot;Hey, you can&#39;t do that!&quot;

&quot;Sure we can,&quot; Misato informed him. &quot;NERV is authorized to commandeer 
any equipment we need to fight the angel threat. We need it, so we&#39;re 
taking it.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Meanwhile, power lines and transformers were being routed to the chosen 
location on the side of Futaga mountain. Huge cooling systems and 
capacitors were being setup to handle the ridiculous amounts of power 
they would need to fire the commandeered rifle. Personnel worked at a 
frantic pace to get everything set up before the dead line.

As work progressed on the site from which they would be firing the 
weapon, NERV technicians worked feverishly to repair Unit 01&#39;s chest 
armor. Eventually, against the odds, all was in readiness...except Unit 
01&#39;s pilot.

Ranma groaned as he opened his eyes. Blinking a few times, he wondered 
if it was Akane&#39;s mallet that got him or if it was her cooking this 
time. Her cooking, he decided, given the queasy feeling in his stomach. 
He became aware that someone was holding his hand when they released it. 
Looking in that direction, his mind caught up to current events when he 
saw Rei sitting beside his bed.

&quot;Hiya, Rei,&quot; Ranma said weakly. &quot;Man, I feel like I was hit with one of 
Ryoga&#39;s Prefect Shi Shi Hokodan&#39;s.&quot;

Ranma blinked as Rei reached down and placed a plastic wrapped package 
in his lap.

&quot;What&#39;s this,&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;That is your plug suit,&quot; Rei began briefing him. &quot;In one hour, we will 
board the Evas and move to the launch site on Futaga Mountain where we 
will receive a further briefing on our mission. I recommend that you 
attempt to eat something before you leave.&quot;

She wheeled a table with a food tray on it over to Ranma&#39;s bed. 
Unfortunately, the glass of water on the tray tipped over and splashed 
Ranma. Ranma blinked several times as she discovered all the pain was 
gone.

&quot;What the...&quot; Ranma said feeling her chest.

&quot;I apologize,&quot; Rei commented before turning and heading out the door.

Ranma didn&#39;t see the small smile on her lips as Rei was faced away from 
her.

Shrugging, Ranma quickly ate her food. It didn&#39;t occur to her until she 
too was leaving the room that Rei had brought her the plug suit for her 
female form.

&quot;Why you little...&quot; Ranma said to herself with a broad smile. &quot;I guess 
you&#39;re developing a sense of humor, Rei.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Well, that&#39;s it for the first tape, Kids,&quot; Nabiki said as she hit the 
rewind. &quot;It&#39;s getting a bit late. How about we meet tomorrow afternoon 
after school to watch the next one?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a wonderful idea, Nabiki,&quot; Kasumi said, forestalling any 
protests from the Fianc&eacute;e Brigade.

&quot;Okay, Sugar,&quot; Ukyo agreed. &quot;I&#39;ll just walk over with you and Akane 
after school.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo be here,&quot; the Amazon fianc&eacute;e announced.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t miss it,&quot; Cologne cackled.

Everyone said their good nights and headed off.</pre>
