<h1>Lost Innocence (part 8 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/thrythlind.html">Thrythlind</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/lostinn-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Genma frowned in confusion as he looked around the Tendo house. He had 
expected to have to sneak in and hide from whoever would happen to be 
at home. This was just a scouting mission, to get a look at the lay of 
the land, see if it would be safe to contact Soun, but he hadn&#39;t 
expected it to be so easy.

&quot;Where is everybody?&quot; he wondered. He frowned and looked for a 
calendar-clock to check the date. He had been losing track of the days 
over the last year or so on the road. &quot;It is a weekday, so Ranma and 
Akane should be in school. Soun and Kasumi should be home though.&quot; He 
wasn&#39;t certain if Nabiki was even still living at the dojo or not.

Genma scratched his head and walked into the kitchen. It was as 
pristine as usual, though there was an extra set of knives apparently. 
A lot of things were kept lower to the ground than he remembered, as 
well. If he didn&#39;t know better, he&#39;d say that the kitchen was used by 
two separate cooks.

He returned to the living room and passed through it on his way to the 
dojo. There was a new trophy sitting next to the small ones Akane had 
collected from local tournaments. She had apparently won the all Tokyo 
competition of late. Genma wasn&#39;t overly impressed, such above board 
competitions never seemed to possess adequate opponents. He saw the 
name Akane on the trophy&#39;s plaque, and simply failed to register the 
Saotome next to it as he glimpsed past it.

Of more important note was the fact that more of the training equipment 
was out of storage. Genma shrugged at that, Soun must have gone back to 
teaching on a more regular level. There couldn&#39;t be that much attention 
on the dojo, though. If the Tendo dojo&#39;s most well known fighter had 
been thoroughly humiliated, nobody would want to train there.

&quot;Probably just Akane,&quot; Genma thought, leaving the dojo. 

He headed upstairs and walked down the hall-way, intending to check the 
guest room to see if he had left anything behind. He was surprised to 
see a wooden plaque on the door. A red horse with Roman letters carved 
into it reading &quot;Ranma and Akane.&quot;

&quot;What-&quot; he glanced back towards where Akane&#39;s room was and noticed for 
the first time that the duck plaque was no longer on the door. Instead 
there was a white cloud with the word &quot;Nursery&quot; engraved on it.

He blinked and then walked into the former guestroom and looked around. 
It had more or less been converted into a second master bedroom, with 
Akane clearly as the decorator. That made some sense, the two 
guestrooms were larger than any of the three girls&#39; rooms. What had 
Genma confused was the mere fact that Ranma and Akane were sharing a 
room. The fact that Ranma was still alive was surprising enough.

In addition to the large western-style bed there were a few other 
pieces of furniture that Genma did not recognize. A large desk with two 
chairs, papers and books neatly stacked and organized. He picked up one 
marked in clear calligraphy that, while not exceptional, was still 
better than Ranma used to be able to achieve.

&quot;Musabetsu Kakuto Saotome-Ryu Revised Training Techniques?&quot; Genma read 
aloud, questioningly.

He flipped through a few pages and frowned. &quot;How can you teach the Ja 
Jinku no Apache without the rattlesnakes?&quot; He was flipping through the 
pages a little further when he heard activity downstairs.

He moved to the door in a near panic. Listening at the top of the 
stairs he heard a lot of feminine carrying on, though he couldn&#39;t hear 
what the topic was. He edged forward a little incautiously to try to 
catch something of what was being said.

Which is how he heard someone coming up the stairs. Thinking quickly, 
and in his normal cowardly manner, he shut the door quietly and moved 
to exit out the window. In a moment he was safely out of the building 
on the roof.

&quot;Hey, Pop,&quot; a quiet voice said. 

Genma turned to see a familiar young woman sitting there on the roof. 
She was wearing a light sweater over a t-shirt, the neck of which Genma 
could barely see, and a pair of black sweats. She had long red hair and 
watched him in a nervous manner. It was a moment before Genma 
recognized Ranma past all the changes.

&quot;I shoulda known you&#39;d show up just ta make somethin&#39; like today more 
nerve-racking. I&#39;ve had a coupla tiring days, Pop, more tiring than my 
fights even.&quot; Ranma said quietly. She looked him over and noted the 
book in her father&#39;s gi. Suddenly her expression turned hard, though 
her voice remained smooth and quiet. &quot;I probably should be resting.&quot;

&quot;Ranma,&quot; Genma said, surprised. He quickly gained his ground though, 
falling into the old act. &quot;What are you doing dressed like that? You&#39;re 
sitting like a girl, and your hair. Have you done nothing to fix that 
lock?&quot;

&quot;Pop...&quot; Ranma started quietly.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Genma said. &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here before your mother 
discovers I&#39;m back and goes through with the contract.&quot; Ranma sighed 
and looked down at the roof, keeping Genma visible from the corner of 
her eye.

&quot;That&#39;s all you care about, isn&#39;t it? I didn&#39;t really understand that 
til I saw you sneaking away from us with my book in your gi.&quot; Ranma 
pointed at the object in question. &quot;What would you do with me after we 
get outta here? Sell me off to some brothel in Hong Kong?&quot;

&quot;How dare you disrespect your father like that?&quot; Genma demanded 
quietly, remembering that Ranma wasn&#39;t the only one home.

&quot;You come to the house,&quot; Ranma said looking up and glancing away, still 
keeping Genma in sight though. &quot;And after what ya had ta see you think 
you can start right up like we never came here?&quot;

&quot;Stop this...&quot;

&quot;Quiet, Pop,&quot; Ranma said softly. &quot;Somebody else&#39;ll know yer here, an&#39; 
some of &#39;em would really like to hurt you. The only reason yer makin&#39; 
any move is &#39;cause I caught ya. You&#39;d rather have left with my 
trainin&#39; manual an&#39; never even dealt with your son, right?&quot; Ranma 
looked toward him.

&quot;These are my techniques boy,&quot; Genma protested. Ranma&#39;s eyebrows arched 
in cool disbelief.

&quot;I don&#39;t remember you training in them,&quot; Ranma said. The sound of a 
baby crying drifted up to them and Ranma looked down at the roof 
standing up. &quot;Take the manual and leave, I can make copies.&quot; She turned 
away from her father down towards the courtyard.

&quot;You don&#39;t understand anything, Boy,&quot; Genma protested. He advanced on 
the girl and then suddenly felt himself flying across the roof. Genma 
rolled to his feet, he hadn&#39;t even seen a hint of Ranma moving.

&quot;I got more important things than you to worry about,&quot; Ranma said 
returning to a relaxed stance. &quot;Leave now, don&#39;t come back. Ever.&quot; Then 
she dropped down to the courtyard and walked into the house.

Genma weighed the pros and cons in his head, and took the opportunity 
Ranma offered him. Besides it was already painfully obvious that Ranma 
wasn&#39;t the manly young man he had raised. And now he had this book of 
techniques revised by his son, certainly there would be some of those 
Amazon techniques within. He really was coming out of this ahead.

He didn&#39;t notice his wife watching him leaving from the front gates of 
the complex. Nodoka watched him leaving and frowned.

------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Yer thinkin&#39; too much,&quot; Ranma said in a cautionary tone. &quot;Just do the 
techniques, don&#39;t think about it.&quot; Akane looked up from the mat at 
Ranma and sat up, looking at the gymnastic equipment they had borrowed 
from Kodachi.

&quot;When do we move on to the next technique?&quot; Akane asked stretching out 
sore joints. Ranma shook her head.

&quot;Sorry, Akane,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Not til&#39; you get this one down.&quot; They both 
looked to the obstacle course, Akane had hit three of the five targets. 
One of the contacts hadn&#39;t exactly been intentional.

&quot;This last add on is a lot harder than I thought it would be,&quot; Akane 
said.

&quot;Yeah, well you gotta get used ta that,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Things ain&#39;t 
always as easy as they look. Hardly ever.&quot; Both had their attention 
pulled to the side of the dojo as Shizu let her parents know that she 
wanted something.

&quot;Is something wrong, Mom?&quot; Ranma asked anxiously as she hurried over to 
where Nodoka was trying to comfort their infant daughter.

&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;s fine,&quot; Akane assured Ranma, but the expression on her 
face, looking over Ranma&#39;s shoulder at Nodoka was just as nervous.

&quot;I think she&#39;s just hungry,&quot; Nodoka said calmly, remembering how she 
and Genma had been just as jumpy when Ranma had first been born. Genma 
had seemed like such a caring father at the time.

&quot;She&#39;s definitely my kid,&quot; Ranma said, in mock annoyance, relief coming 
through clearly. She turned to Akane, who carefully tried to hide her 
own former worry from Ranma. &quot;I guess just try to run through it a 
couple of times while I take care of her, kay, Akane?&quot;

&quot;Just,&quot; Akane repeated, turning to look at the acrobatic obstacle 
course again. &quot;If you need any help just say something.&quot; Ranma smiled 
as she took Shizu from Nodoka and walked into the house. There was no 
way she was going to nurse Shizu in a room as open as the dojo.

&quot;I think I can handle this myself,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;Well, like you said, she&#39;s your daughter,&quot; Akane said. &quot;And as hungry 
as you used to get...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not practicing,&quot; Ranma said as she left the room.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Nodoka said, following Ranma, leaving Akane to her 
practice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Do you mind if I sit in the room with you?&quot; Nodoka asked as Ranma 
turned into the nursery. Ranma looked up and hesitated a moment before 
answering.

&quot;Uhh, no,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I...uh guess that&#39;s fine.&quot; She sat down in the 
western rocking chair Kodachi had given them for the bridal shower and 
started to unbutton her shirt. 

That was a somewhat unwelcome change. Ranma preferred shirts and 
sweaters that didn&#39;t have buttons or zippers or such. Given the choice 
of having to completely take off her clothes to nurse and wearing 
clothes that could be opened, however, she went with the latter.

&quot;Does that make you uncomfortable?&quot; Nodoka asked sitting down on 
another chair. She herself was analyzing the way Ranma was going about 
this definitely female task.

&quot;No, no, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Ranma protested. Shizu cried in her arms, and Ranma 
turned her attention back to her daughter. &quot;Ssssh, Mommy hasn&#39;t 
forgotten you.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Mommy?&#39;&quot; Nodoka repeated as Shizu started nursing.

&quot;Well, I am her mother,&quot; Ranma said, hesitantly.

&quot;And what will you tell her while you&#39;re male?&quot; Nodoka asked. Ranma 
shrugged but didn&#39;t answer, looking away from her mother and carefully 
watching her daughter. &quot;Incidentally, shouldn&#39;t the lock be coming off 
your curse within the next few days?&quot;

&quot;Well, maybe,&quot; Ranma said. Nodoka frowned.

&quot;You don&#39;t sound either enthusiastic or concerned,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;It 
has been nearly a month since Shizu was born.&quot;

&quot;A little more,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;You have been keeping track,&quot; Nodoka said with a little hope.

&quot;I know Shizu&#39;s age to the second,&quot; Ranma said softly, smiling down at 
her little girl. Nodoka sighed as she recognized the same wonder she 
had possessed in first year with Ranma. &quot;She&#39;s a lot of work, like 
everything else I got worth something.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you have been able to change by now?&quot; Nodoka asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I haven&#39;t been thinking about it.&quot; She 
frowned slightly, she had known this was coming.

&quot;Haven&#39;t been thinking about it?&quot; Nodoka repeated in surprise. &quot;Why 
not?&quot; Even if Ranma wanted to stay a woman, she had to consider the 
unlocking curse.

&quot;Mom,&quot; Ranma said, she hesitated and looked down at Shizu. She was 
certain that the little girl understood a lot more than everybody 
thought. She seemed like such a clever little girl. Ranma smirked a 
moment. ~Hungry too.~

&quot;Yes...dear?&quot; Nodoka said. Ranma sighed and turned serious again.

&quot;I can&#39;t even remember much of what being a guy was like,&quot; Ranma 
admitted quietly. &quot;&#39;Cept I was never good &#39;nuff an&#39; I had no friends, 
an&#39; too many people wanted a piece o&#39;me...&quot; She sighed and continued. 
&quot;One way or another.&quot;

&quot;Well, certainly your current situation won&#39;t change by going back to 
what you were,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;Do you really think that people are your 
friends because you have a female body now?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Ranma said after a long moment. &quot;It won&#39;t get any better to 
change either.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll be a man again,&quot; Nodoka said. Ranma shook her head.

&quot;Nah, I&#39;ll be male half the time again,&quot; Ranma said. She looked up at 
Nodoka nervously. &quot;I&#39;m Shizu&#39;s mother, not her father.&quot; Nodoka looked 
to the walls of the nursery. The wallpaper was very active with Chinese 
style paintings of clouds and suns in lively colors.

&quot;You&#39;re certain about this?&quot; Nodoka asked seriously.

&quot;I suck at being a man,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I could never figure out what I 
was supposed ta do, an&#39; everybody was tellin&#39; me different stuff. Now, 
I don&#39;t talk right, an&#39; I ain&#39;t a soft little flower, an&#39; I&#39;m kinda a 
tomboy. But at least I understand being a woman.&quot;

&quot;And you want to stay that way?&quot; Nodoka asked. &quot;Do you enjoy it?&quot;

&quot;Other than the jerks that think they can push me around because...you 
know,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Or the people that think I just can&#39;t handle stuff 
any more &#39;cause of the same thing. Other than that it&#39;s fine. I ain&#39;t 
confused no more.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Nodoka said. Ranma looked down at her daughter and sighed.

&quot;Sorry, Mom,&quot; Ranma said softly. &quot;You&#39;ll have to settle for a daughter 
in love with another woman.&quot;

&quot;And married to her,&quot; Nodoka said, she sighed and looked around.

&quot;You&#39;ve discussed this with Akane?&quot; Nodoka asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;It&#39;ll take some work...&quot; Nodoka said after a moment. &quot;But Kasumi 
warned me you might make this choice. I think I can handle this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Mom,&quot; Ranma said quietly. She looked down and smiled. &quot;An&#39; it 
looks like someone has their fill for now.&quot; 

Shizu blinked and yawned, sleepy after nursing. Ranma burped the baby 
as she had been taught and then held her until she fell asleep. Then 
Ranma was lying Shizu down into the crib and buttoning her shirt up 
again.

&quot;I have everything I need,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I don&#39;t need to change.&quot;

&quot;I suppose not,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;You should check to see how Akane is 
doing, I&#39;ll watch Shizu.&quot; Ranma nodded, lingering to watch her daughter 
sleep a moment longer and tuck her in.

&quot;Hopefully, I can correct the method mistakes on the next technique 
before she learns this one,&quot; Ranma said shaking her head. She idly 
wondered if Genma had yet figured out that the copy of the manual he 
had was just notes on how to correct Genma&#39;s mistakes.

&quot;Night night, Shizu,&quot; Ranma said quietly. She ruffled her daughter&#39;s 
mop of red hair gently, so as not to wake her up, blew her a kiss and 
then walked to the door. &quot;Thanks again, Mom.&quot;

&quot;Your welcome,&quot; Nodoka said, pausing a moment. &quot;Aijou.&quot; Ranma blinked 
in surprise and then smiled brightly before heading for the dojo.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Note: &quot;Aijou&quot;, according to my sources, translates to &quot;beloved 
daughter&quot;...of course since my sources are Japanese-English 
dictionaries there is plenty of room for error.
