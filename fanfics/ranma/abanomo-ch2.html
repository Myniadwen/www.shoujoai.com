<h1>Abandoned No More (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fherriot.html">Fred Herriot</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/abanomo-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>IN THE FIRST PART OF &quot;RANKO, ABANDONED NO MORE,&quot; the Saotomes
travel to Jookoji- shima, an island in the East China Sea
containing the magical Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang (&quot;Mud Spring of
Abandoned Daughters&quot;).  Falling into the spring, Ranma learns
that anyone who encounters Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang creates a female
replica of himself containing the soul one of the thousands of
girls sacrificed there.  The replica Ranma is adopted by the
Saotomes and named Ranko.  Ranko works hard at being accepted by
her family, ensuring all around her is well.  This forces a
confrontation with Shampoo.  The Chinese warrior-maiden is
soundly thrashed by Ranko after she tried to force Ranma and
Akane apart.  Here, we learn that those born of
Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang possess considerable influence over Shampoo&#39;s
clan; Ranko forces Shampoo to publicly forswear Ranma forever.

Moving along now...ON WITH THE SHOW!!!!

**** **** ****

     &quot;So that is the whole story, eh?&quot; Cologne sighs as she
relaxes by the Saotome living room table with Genma, Nodoka,
Ranma and Ranko.  Shampoo sits by her great-grandmother, her damp
cheeks speaking volumes.  &quot;Happousai tricked you into going to
Jookoji-shima so that he could create a perfect love-slave...and
Ranko is the result,&quot; she gazes at the newest member of the
Saotome family.

     &quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Ranma nods.  &quot;Fortunately, Jiji fouled up
the part about enslaving Ranko-chan to him.&quot;

     &quot;Fortunately, indeed,&quot; Cologne nods.  &quot;If word of this ever
got back to Juketsuzoku, Happousai&#39;s life would not be worth
anything.&quot;

     &quot;Why?&quot; Genma blinks.

     &quot;For that, I must go back four thousand years, to the time
of Confucius,&quot; the elderly matriarch sighs.  &quot;When his teachings
became accepted, the matriarchial-inclined clans in China were
perceived as social abberations.  When news of
Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang&#39;s existence spread, daughters divined
astrologically to be rebellious or too strong for their parents&#39;
liking...were drowned in the spring.

     &quot;Expectantly, there were those who saw this trend as nothing
short of state-sanctioned murder.  Shortly after, the spring&#39;s
special power was discovered.  A small group of distraught
mothers, determined to see their slain daughters avenged, created
an army of female warriors to stop this.  Those warriors were the
progenitors of the Nyu-che-zuu.  Since, we have fought to
demonstrate to other Chinese that there is another way.  Sadly,
we have been unsuccessful; as Confucius&#39; teachings spread to
Korea and Japan, others saw the &#39;advantage&#39; of
Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang.&quot;

     &quot;So your clan protects the spring, tries to prevent more
daughters from being...disposed of,&quot; Ranma feels his stomach turn
over.

     &quot;Exactly,&quot; Cologne nods.  &quot;Eventually, those inclined to see
the dark side of Confucius&#39; teachings...Buddhists, Shintoists,
shamanists and Taoists ...decided that a monitor team should be
sent to Jookoji-shima to ensure that no one uses of the spring.
Over the years...and as selective abortion became widespread,&quot;
her mouth twists into a sneer, &quot;...Nini-Quan-Qi-Niang lost its
original purpose.&quot;

     The others nod.  &quot;Well, now we understand what&#39;s going on,&quot;
Nodoka nods.  &quot;Thank you for telling us this, Cologne.  At least
in this way, Shampoo is free of any obligations she feels towards
my son.&quot;

     Hearing that, Shampoo wails as she runs out of the home.
&quot;Aw, Mom, did you have to say that in front of her?!&quot; Ranma
sighs.

     &quot;Shampoo sooner or later would have to accept what has
happened between you and Akane, Ranma,&quot; Nodoka sighs, projecting
an understanding look.  &quot;So will Ukyou and Kodachi.  It&#39;s better
if it happens sooner; who knows what could happen if they allowed
their jealousy to build and build to the point where you&#39;ll never
know a moment&#39;s peace.  Besides, Shampoo and Ukyou have nice
young men pursuing them in Mousse and Konatsu.  Perhaps Kodachi
does.  We should do our best to facilitate those relationships,
not impede them.&quot;

     &quot;Here, I&#39;ll go talk to Shampoo,&quot; Ranko stands and heads
out...

                           *    *    *

     Sometime later, Ranko locates Shampoo under a tree, her head
buried between her legs.  Sobs burst from Shampoo as Ranko sits
beside her, guilt flashing across her face on seeing how her
actions have hurt the warrior-maiden.  &quot;Shampoo, don&#39;t be sad,&quot;
Ranko sighs.  &quot;If anyone knows what&#39;s really going on in my
brother&#39;s head, it&#39;s me.  You have to accept that he wants
Akane.&quot;

     &quot;Why Ranma no love Shampoo?!&quot; the Chinese woman demands.
&quot;Why he care for stupid tomboy Akane?!  Shampoo love Ranma!&quot;

     &quot;I&#39;m sure you do,&quot; Ranko sighs.  &quot;Look, Shampoo, for a very
long time, Onii-chan was confused about his feelings for anyone.
Papa and Tendou-oji-chan forced him into the engagement.  Of
course, there was Akane-onee-chan&#39;s many shortcomings.  But as he
came to understand his feelings better, he discovered that yes,
he does love Akane-onee-chan.  And...he does care a lot for you.&quot;

     Shampoo blinks.  &quot;Ranko...&quot;

     &quot;But, because Mousse is around, Onii-chan believes that if
anyone deserves your hand, it&#39;s him,&quot; Ranko concludes.

     Contempt flashes in Shampoo&#39;s eyes.  &quot;Hmph!!  Mousse no beat
Shampoo in battle!  Why Shampoo should care for stupid Mousse?!&quot;

     &quot;Because Mousse has always been there for you, idiot,&quot; Ranko
sighs.  &quot;Because he does care for you!  And maybe, he comes from
a part of your clan which abhors that rule about defeating a
woman to claim her as a fiancee.  In all the time Onii-chan&#39;s
known Mousse, he has NEVER once heard him speak about winning
your love in that fashion.  And if you can&#39;t see that, Shampoo,
then you&#39;re a coward!&quot;

     Shampoo&#39;s eyes flash as she bolts to her feet, grabbing
Ranko by her shirt.  &quot;What Ranko say?!!  Take that back!!!
Shampoo no coward!!!&quot;

     &quot;Hey, you can deny it all you want, but believe me, I
understand where you&#39;re coming from,&quot; Ranko gently guides the
other&#39;s hands away.  &quot;Onii-chan couldn&#39;t face his feelings for
Akane-onee-chan; that made him as much a coward as you!  He&#39;s
faced up to it.  Why can&#39;t you?!&quot;

     Shampoo jolts as the words hit home.  Tears flowing down her
cheeks, she sinks into Ranko&#39;s embrace.  &quot;Shampoo...Shampoo no
know what to think anymore...&quot; she sobs.

     &quot;There, there, Shampoo,&quot; Ranko gently kisses her forehead.
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay.  Let it out.&quot;

     Moments pass as the warrior-maiden vents herself, gently
rocked by this woman who, while standing firm on who Ranma will
marry, is willing to understand and help Shampoo accept the
inevitable.  Ranma was gone.  A good friend and fighting partner.
Nothing more.  Finally, Shampoo wipes her eyes, smiling.
&quot;Shampoo...happy Ranko understand what Shampoo feels about Ranma.
Still...is hard for Shampoo to accept what happened to Ranma and
Akane.&quot;

     &quot;Of course it is,&quot; Ranko nods.  &quot;Life&#39;s never easy,
Shampoo.&quot;

                           *    *    *

     Sometime later, Ukyou learns what happened.  &quot;So because
Ranko comes from this Jookoji-shima place, everything she says,
you have to accept?!&quot; the okonomiyaki cook blinks, gazing at
Shampoo in disbelief.  The two now relax in Ucchan&#39;s.  &quot;I never
thought I&#39;d ever see you give up on anything, Shampoo, most of
all Ran-chan!&quot;

     &quot;Shampoo love Ranma,&quot; Shampoo admits.  &quot;But...if Ranma love
Akane, Shampoo&#39;s efforts do no good.  Ranma&#39;s mother right; soon,
we all have to face reality...and let Ranma go.&quot;

     Ukyou looks down.  The idea of finally losing Ranma to
Akane, even though his feelings for the younger Tendou were
blatantly obvious now, still was too much to take.  &quot;I think our
pride&#39;s getting in the way of what we see,&quot; she sighs.

     &quot;Ukyou right,&quot; Shampoo nods, giving her friend&#39;s hand a
squeeze.  &quot;Shampoo try to help?&quot;

     Ukyou shudders as tears begin to flow.  &quot;Thanks, Shampoo.&quot;

     Suddenly, the door opens, followed by a storm of black rose
pedals flying into Ucchan&#39;s!  &quot;IS THIS TRUE?!?!?!&quot; an incensed
voice barks.

     Shampoo and Ukyou turn to see a VERY mad Kodachi Kunou
standing at the door, her combat ribbon twirling menacingly
around her.  &quot;Hi, Kodachi,&quot; Ukyou sighs.  &quot;C&#39;mon in.  Want
something to eat?&quot;

     &quot;Don&#39;t avoid the subject, Kuonji!!!&quot; Kodachi races up to
stare Ukyou right in the eyes.  &quot;What&#39;s this about Ranma-kun
actually loving that tramp Akane, actually going along with that
moron&#39;s agreement their idiot fathers forced them into?!!
Well?!!&quot;

     &quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; Ukyou sighs, then gazes quizzically at the
rhythmic gymnast.  &quot;Wait a sec!!  Why are you so uppity about
this now?!  You were there when Ran- chan&#39;s and Akane&#39;s dads
tried to get them hitched!&quot;

     &quot;Of course I was!&quot; Kodachi snarls, then hopefully turns
away.  &quot;But when my poor, precious Ranma-kun said he wanted to
wait, I felt that a chance was still there to claim him for
myself!!&quot;  Her body then quakes as heat boils from her skin.
&quot;Now, that red-haired she-demon Ranko has the audacity to state
that poor, sweet Ranma-kun actually loves Tendou!!  I will NEVER
stand for this!!  Never!!!&quot;

     &quot;Ranko told you, eh?&quot; Ukyou sighs.  &quot;I guess she&#39;ll be
coming here to give me an earfull soon enough!&quot;

     Kodachi gazes at the others.  &quot;I don&#39;t believe this!!
You&#39;re just standing there doing NOTHING?!?!  You&#39;re actually
going to allow that she-demon to dictate our love-lives?!!&quot;

     &quot;Ranko know better than anyone what Ranma feel,&quot; Shampoo
sighs.  &quot;Ranma want Akane.  No place for Shampoo, Ukyou or
Kodachi.&quot;

     Kodachi snorts, looking away.  &quot;Then that means you don&#39;t
love Ranma-kun at all!&quot;

     The others glare at her, the air ablaze with their fury.
&quot;You got some nerve, Kunou!!!&quot; Ukyou&#39;s eyes flash.  &quot;My love for
Ran-chan is just as great as yours!!!  I&#39;m taking this as hard as
you!!!  We&#39;ve lost; let&#39;s admit it and get on with our lives!!!&quot;

     &quot;I will NEVER admit that!&quot; Kodachi vows.

     &quot;Then Ranko beat Kodachi into pulp!&quot; Shampoo sighs.

     &quot;We&#39;ll see!!&quot; Kodachi snorts, looking away.  &quot;I&#39;ll bet
&#39;Ranko&#39; is actually my poor Ranma-kun forced to speak such filthy
thoughts when he becomes a girl!  Turn him back to a boy and
we&#39;ll see!&quot;

     Ukyou and Shampoo gaze at her.  &quot;Kodachi know about Ranma
curse?!&quot; the latter blinks.

     &quot;Well, admittedly, it took me some time to understand what
was going on,&quot; Kodachi shudders.  &quot;After all, that red-haired
demon and Ranma-kun were never in the same place at the same
time.  And...someone recently told me about Jusenkyou.&quot;

     &quot;Who?!&quot; both prod.

     &quot;A friend of yours,&quot; Kodachi gazes at Ukyou.  &quot;Tsubasa
Kurenai.&quot;

     &quot;Tsubasa?!&quot; Ukyou gasps, then looks down.  &quot;Um...how is he?&quot;

     &quot;He&#39;s all right,&quot; the former admits, fighting to keep her
face from turning red.  &quot;I&#39;ve had the chance to get to know him
recently.&quot;

     &quot;In a more than friendly fashion, I see,&quot; Ukyou muses.

     Kodachi flushes.  &quot;Certainly not!!&quot; she angrily snaps, then
looks embarrassed.  &quot;Well...I admit that he is...attractive...but
he&#39;s nowhere near Ranma-kun!&quot;

     &quot;Hey, I thought the same thing when Tsubasa came after me,&quot;
Ukyou places an okonomiyaki before Kodachi.  &quot;Relax and have
something to eat.  We&#39;re all moping our loss today.&quot;

     &quot;Hmph!!&quot; Kodachi looks away.  &quot;I still think someone&#39;s
trying to force Ranma-kun into Tendou&#39;s clutches!!  As a matter
of fact, I&#39;ll go out and prove it tonight!&quot;

     &quot;Your funeral,&quot; Ukyou sighs...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;You&#39;re going to Jusenkyou?!&quot; Ranko blinks.

     Ranma and Akane nod.  They have tea in the Saotomes&#39;
apartment.  &quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Akane sighs.  &quot;Ranma wants to find
some way to rid himself of his curse.  We just heard from the
guide that after the fight on Hoo-oo-san, Jusenkyou&#39;s ponds
magically reformed.  Now&#39;s the best chance for Ranma to get rid
of his...other half.&quot;

     Ranko looks down, feeling chilled.  &quot;Hey, we didn&#39;t mean
that!&quot; Ranma places his hands on her shoulders.  &quot;Look, we&#39;ll be
gone a week and then we&#39;ll be right back.  Don&#39;t be scared.  Mom
and Dad are going on their second honeymoon.  Akane&#39;s dad and
sisters&#39;ll still be around.&quot;

     &quot;I...I hope so,&quot; Ranko sighs.  &quot;I...I know you have your
lives ahead of you and I don&#39;t have any right to intrude...but it
would be nice to have someone stay with me.&quot;

     &quot;You&#39;ll find someone soon enough,&quot; Akane smiles.  &quot;If you
want, go after Kunou.  Nabiki might want to take Ken&#39;nosuke-san.&quot;

     &quot;Ugh!  No thanks!!&quot; Ranko shudders.  &quot;Well...have a nice
trip.  Please don&#39;t get into trouble.&quot;

     &quot;We&#39;ll try not to,&quot; Ranma smiles...

                           *    *    *

     That evening, Kodachi slips over the wall of the Tendou
home, sneaking her way toward the front door.  Her eyes inspect
the new addition, remembering that Ranma&#39;s parents now wanted to
live with their child.  She icily smiles, then melts into shadow
as Kasumi, Nabiki and Souun return from the bathhouse.  &quot;Hope
Ranko-chan&#39;s not going too nuts being alone,&quot; Nabiki sighs.  &quot;I
thought those Guardians said she wasn&#39;t supposed to be isolated.&quot;

     &quot;Relax, Nabiki,&quot; Souun chuckles.  &quot;I&#39;m sure Ranko-chan will
be fine.  Besides, she&#39;ll have to get used to being alone sooner
or later.  Best to do it now while she&#39;s still young.&quot;

     &quot;Let&#39;s hope there&#39;s no trouble,&quot; Kasumi muses as they head
inside.

     In shadows, Kodachi boils with rage.  &quot;How dare they?!&quot; she
hisses as her mind re-runs what she heard.  It was bad enough
that whenever her precious Ranma was made a girl, they referred
to him as &quot;Ranko,&quot; but to actually plot to abandon him?  Is that
all Ranma was to them:  a toy to be used, then discarded?!
Indignant rage boils from her heart as Kodachi slips toward the
Saotomes&#39; wing.  *Hang on, my love!* she vows.  *I&#39;ll save you
from this madness!!*

     Deftly, the rhythmic gymnast slips to the bathroom window,
boosting herself up to glance inside.  The sounds of water
splashing around confirm someone is home.  Glancing through the
window, Kodachi blinks on seeing Ranko soap herself down.  &quot;There
you are, love,&quot; Kodachi sighs.

     Even now, it was hard to fully accept that this red-haired
she-devil before her and her precious Ranma were one and the same
person, alterable with a simple dousing of cold or hot water.
However, Tsubasa had been thorough in explaining what Ranma lived
through, a fact of life Shampoo herself experienced as she
demonstrated in Ucchan&#39;s earlier.  Cold water brought on the
demon, hot water her darling Ranma.  Kodachi smiles as Ranko
finishes soaping down, then stands to immerse herself in the
steaming hot tub awaiting her.

     Ranko sighs as she plunges in, allowing the soap to wash off
her before surfacing.  Laying back, she sighs.  &quot;I hate being
alone,&quot; she blinks, gazing at the ceiling.  Then, her sixth sense
flashes a warning.  Ranko looks at the window...to see Kodachi
staring at her, hanging from the window-sill.  &quot;Kodachi?!!&quot; she
gasps, bolting to her feet.  &quot;What are you doing here?!!&quot;

     Seeing that her precious had NOT transformed, the rhythmic
gymnast vaults through the window, snap-drawing her whip as she
takes a ready pose.  &quot;I don&#39;t know who and what you are,
she-demon, but you&#39;ll not possess my precious Ranma- kun
anymore!!&quot; Kodachi snarls.  &quot;Prepare for the justice you&#39;ve long
deserved!!!&quot;

     Ranko blinks, confused as to why Kodachi would barge in here
and accuse her of possessing her own brother.  &quot;Um...what are you
talking about, Kodachi?&quot; she wonders.  &quot;Onii-chan isn&#39;t here!
He&#39;s gone to China with Akane-onee-chan!&quot;

     &quot;What?!!&quot; Kodachi screams.  &quot;How dare you address my dear
Ranma-kun as your brother, you witch?!  Prepare to receive divine
punishment for your many sins against him!!!&quot;

     Ranko shudders, then notices she is standing in hot water.
Staring at Kodachi, Ranko realizes that somehow, the rhythmic
gymnast knows of Jusenkyou.  &quot;Wait a moment, Kodachi,&quot; she steps
out of the tub, reaching for a towel.  &quot;Before you fly off the
handle, you know that if I was Onii-chan...Ranma...I&#39;d turn into
a guy when I stepped in there, right?&quot; she points to the tub.

     &quot;Of course I do!&quot; Kodachi nods.  &quot;I finally understand the
level of suffering you put my sweet Ranma-kun through, ever since
his idiot father took him to that cursed spring place in China!!
You&#39;ve taken over him every time he&#39;s been doused in cold water!
Now you&#39;re trying to take Ranma-kun away from me, force him into
the clutches of that witch Akane!!  And I will not tolerate
it!!!&quot;

     &quot;Alright, then,&quot; Ranko takes off the towel.  &quot;Then if I am
Ranma, I should turn back into a boy when I do this!&quot;

     With that, she steps into the tub and submerges herself.  A
second later, she bursts free, gazing at Kodachi.  &quot;Well?!&quot;

     Kodachi blinks.  &quot;You...you didn&#39;t...change...!&quot;

     &quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Ranko nods.  &quot;I&#39;m not Ranma Saotome.  You
can call me Ranko.  I&#39;m a double of Ranma&#39;s, created from a
magical mud spring on Jookoji- shima sometime ago.  In
effect...I&#39;m Ranma&#39;s sister.&quot;

     Silence falls over the bathroom as Kodachi absorbs what has
been said.  She then remembers Ukyou and Shampoo telling her
about a female doppelganger of Ranma who had forced the latter to
publicly renounce her engagement that morning.  But by then,
Kodachi had become so incensed over Ranko&#39;s interference, she had
not clearly understood what others were trying to tell her.
&quot;Where is Ranma-kun?&quot; she demands.

     &quot;He left today with Akane-onee-chan,&quot; Ranko reports.
&quot;They&#39;re going to Jusenkyou to find a way to undo the curses.
Now, if I was the she-demon you imagined me to be, would I allow
Onii-chan to do that?&quot;

     &quot;Well...no, I guess not,&quot; Kodachi muses, scratching the back
of her head embarrassingly.  &quot;So...I...oh, dear...&quot;

     Ranko smiles.  &quot;Here, let me dry off and I&#39;ll be happy to
tell you everything,&quot; she rises from the bath...

                           *    *    *

     Sometime later, Ranko and Kodachi relax in the living room.
The rhythmic gymnast stares forlornly at the koi pond in front of
the apartment, still reeling from realizing that despite the
recent failed wedding, Ranma, the first man she had truly come to
care for, was indeed in love with Akane Tendou.  Ranko relaxes
beside her, allowing Kodachi the chance to think.  &quot;You okay?&quot;
the lost girl wonders.

     &quot;I...not really,&quot; Kodachi sighs.  &quot;All this time, I&#39;ve
allowed my passions to blind me so much, that when this came, I
was caught off guard.  Now...now I feel as miserable as Ukyou and
Shampoo.&quot;

     &quot;Hey, think of how Onii-chan feels,&quot; Ranko muses.  &quot;I mean,
he still likes you girls; it&#39;s just that he&#39;s finally decided to
come to grips with his feelings.  And they...are now guiding him
to Akane-onee-chan.  It doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t stop being your
friend, Kodachi.  He&#39;ll be there if you need help.  So will I.&quot;

     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Kodachi&#39;s mouth twitches.  &quot;So...how much of
you is Ranma- kun?&quot;

     &quot;Everything up here,&quot; Ranko indicates her mind.  &quot;Plus, this
body was constructed when Onii-chan was in his cursed body.
Fortunately, I wasn&#39;t magically slaved to Jiji when he tricked my
family into going to Jookoji-shima.  Other than that, there&#39;s not
much more to explain.&quot;

     Kodachi sighs.  &quot;Well, I&#39;ve taken enough of your time, I
guess,&quot; she rises.  &quot;Thank you for your...hospitality.  I better
go home.&quot;

     Ranko blinks.  &quot;Won&#39;t you stay a while?  Mama and Papa are
off by themselves, so I...I&#39;m alone tonight.&quot;

     The rhythmic gymnast feels herself quake as Ranko projects a
very friendly smile.  &quot;Well...&quot;

     Suddenly, both tense as the faint whiff of alcohol assaults
their noses.  &quot;So, there y&#39;are, y&#39;nosy tramp!&quot; a drunken voice
slurs.

     Ranko and Kodachi turn to see a flush-faced Ukyou and
Shampoo standing by the door.  &quot;Ukyou!!  Shampoo!!&quot; the former
rises.  &quot;What are you doing here?!&quot;

     &quot;Stupid Ranko-spirit no know when t&#39;leave enough alone!&quot;
Shampoo snarls, staggering toward the lost girl.  &quot;Ranko-spirit
team with Akane t&#39;take Ranma away from Shampoo!  Now Ranko-spirit
team with Kodachi!  Shampoo teach Ranko-spirit lesson she
deserve!!&quot;

     &quot;Phoo!!&quot; Ranko&#39;s nose wrinkles as she slowly backs away from
the inebriated would-be fiancees.  &quot;You&#39;re drunk!  Get out of
here!!  Mousse and Konatsu are probably worried sick about you
two!&quot;

     &quot;Don&#39; bring them in this, y&#39;slut!&quot; Ukyou snarls, drawing her
combat spatula.  &quot;We&#39;ll teach ya ta stick y&#39;nose inta our
business!!&quot;

     Kodachi sighs.  &quot;I think you two need to sleep this off,&quot;
she reaches to her side, then fires two black roses at Ukyou and
Shampoo.

     Thanks to their intoxication, both are unable to dodge the
drug-laced flowers.  A powder explodes from the pedals, sending
both down like marionettes with their strings cut.  As faint
snores flutter from their mouths, Ranko and Kodachi relax.  &quot;I
better call Mousse and Konatsu to get these lushes home,&quot; the
former turns to the telephone.  &quot;Thanks, Kodachi.  I appreciate
it.&quot;

     &quot;You don&#39;t realize how much I sympathize with them,&quot; Kodachi
sighs, gazing concernedly at her once-rivals...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;We are so sorry this happened, Ranko-san,&quot; Konatsu
repentantly bows, holding the sleeping Ukyou in his arms.  &quot;I
lost track of Ukyou-san when she and Shampoo went out this
evening.  I...wish I could&#39;ve done something to prevent this from
happening.&quot;

     &quot;Well, Kodachi-chan was here to keep things calm,&quot; Ranko
smiles at Kodachi.  &quot;But...I suppose this was expected.&quot;

     &quot;Forgive me for asking, Kodachi, but I&#39;d expect you&#39;d be
joining Shampoo and Ukyou in mourning,&quot; Mousse gently cradles his
drunken would-be wife.  &quot;Why aren&#39;t you?&quot;

     &quot;Admittedly, I would,&quot; Kodachi smiles.  &quot;But...I&#39;m allergic
to strong alcohol.  I can barely tolerate wine, much less sake.
I...guess I&#39;ll mourn in my own way.&quot;

     &quot;Let&#39;s hope it&#39;s not violent,&quot; Ranko hums.  &quot;Given all our
skills, we could wreck this place just as fast as aliens tear
apart Tomobiki.&quot;

     Everyone laughs, then Konatsu and Mousse depart with their
sleeping would- be wives.  Ranko and Kodachi sigh, then face the
other.  &quot;You sure I can&#39;t talk you into staying with me tonight?&quot;
the former projects a friendly smile.  &quot;I won&#39;t bite.&quot;

     Kodachi bites her lip, then warily smiles.  &quot;Well...I
suppose I could stay...Ranko-chan.&quot;

     &quot;Great!&quot; Ranko gently guides her guest inside.  &quot;It&#39;s a
relief, actually.  I...I just don&#39;t like being alone.&quot;

     Kodachi breathes out.  Coming from a same-sex high school,
she knew a student&#39;s curiosity concerning her sexuality could
provoke some very intimate situations.  On several occasions,
Kodachi had taken a classmate into a private corner to &quot;alleviate
one&#39;s headache.&quot;  It was quite enjoyable if you maintained your
perspective...and if you were not caught; the administration at
St. Bacchus frowned harshly on these liaisons.  She did not
believe herself a lesbian; her attraction to Ranma and Tsubasa
proved that.

     Given Ranko&#39;s origins...she was Ranma permanently trapped in
a woman&#39;s body...Kodachi concluded that if the right set of
circumstances presented themselves, she could obtain a version of
her dream...if she was willing to take a great risk.  But she did
not consider herself THAT brave!  &quot;Um... Ranko?&quot; Kodachi stares
at her host.  &quot;Have you yet...given thought to... whether or not
you&#39;d want a...lover?&quot;

     Ranko blinks, then puts the kettle on for tea.  &quot;Why would I
care about that now?&quot; she wonders.  &quot;Yeesh, Kodachi!  Let me get
my life together before worrying about a girlfriend!&quot;

     Kodachi feels a light tremor shake her bones.  Either Ranko
had not yet fully accepted in her heart that she was a girl...or
else Ranko had accepted it, but decided she did not want a man.
If so, things around Ranko could become very, very interesting...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Ranko...&quot; a dreamy voice tickles the lost girl&#39;s ears.

     Ranko&#39;s eyes flutter open, then they go wide as she finds
herself facing a nude Akane, drifting toward her, her hands out
and reaching for Ranma&#39;s sister.  &quot;A-akane!!&quot; Ranko gasps, trying
to back away, sweating on seeing the inviting look on her future
sister-in-law&#39;s face.  &quot;Akane-onee-chan, what are you doing?!&quot;

     &quot;I want you, Ranko, my love,&quot; Akane intones.

     Her hands fall on Ranko&#39;s shoulder as the youngest Tendou
drifts into the latter&#39;s waiting embrace.  Ranko then realizes
she is as nude as Akane.  Her assault on Ranko&#39;s senses paralyzes
the lost child as Akane fixes her with a determined stare.
&quot;Akane, I can&#39;t...&quot; Ranko feels tears sting her cheek.  &quot;I can&#39;t
be the one for you.  I...I can&#39;t be the man you want.&quot;

     &quot;Silly girl,&quot; Akane breathes on Ranko&#39;s ear, her hands
drifting to the latter&#39;s buttocks, forcing their hips together.

     Ranko nearly drowns in the resulting burst of pleasure.
Without invitation, their lips lock, their tongues playfully
duelling as their embrace tightens to the point where it seems
they cannot breathe.  &quot;You see,&quot; Akane smiles.  &quot;It&#39;s you I love.
The outside doesn&#39;t matter.  It&#39;s what&#39;s on the inside that
matters...&quot;

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Ran-chan...&quot; a dreamy voice tickles the lost girl&#39;s ears.

     Ranko&#39;s eyes flutter open, then they go wide as she finds
herself facing a nude Ukyou, drifting toward her, her hands out
and reaching for Ranma&#39;s sister.  &quot;U-u-chan!!&quot; Ranko gasps,
trying to back away, sweating on seeing the inviting look on the
okonomiyaki cook&#39;s face.  &quot;U-chan, what are you doing?!&quot;

     &quot;I want you, Ranko-chan, my love,&quot; Ukyou intones.

     Her hands fall on Ranko&#39;s shoulder as Ukyou drifts into the
latter&#39;s waiting embrace.  Ranko then realizes she is as nude as
Ukyou.  Her assault on Ranko&#39;s senses paralyzes the lost child as
Ukyou fixes her with a determined stare.  &quot;U-chan, I can&#39;t...&quot;
Ranko feels tears sting her cheek.  &quot;I can&#39;t be the one for you.
I...I can&#39;t be the man you want.&quot;

     &quot;Silly girl,&quot; Ukyou breathes on Ranko&#39;s ear, her hands
drifting to the latter&#39;s buttocks, forcing their hips together.

     Ranko nearly drowns in the resulting burst of pleasure.
Without invitation, their lips lock, their tongues playfully
duelling as their embrace tightens to the point where it seems
they cannot breathe.  &quot;You see,&quot; Ukyou smiles.  &quot;I love you,
silly.  The outside doesn&#39;t matter.  It&#39;s what&#39;s on the inside
that counts...&quot;

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Ranko...&quot; a dreamy voice tickles the lost girl&#39;s ears.

     Ranko&#39;s eyes flutter open, then they go wide as she finds
herself facing a nude Shampoo, drifting toward her, her hands out
and reaching for Ranma&#39;s sister.  &quot;Sh-shampoo!!&quot; Ranko gasps,
trying to back away, sweating on seeing the inviting look on the
Chinese warrior-maiden&#39;s face.  &quot;Shampoo, what are you doing?!&quot;

     &quot;Shampoo want Ranko to love,&quot; Shampoo intones.

     Her hands fall on Ranko&#39;s shoulder as the warrior-maiden
drifts into the latter&#39;s waiting embrace.  Ranko then realizes
she is as nude as Shampoo.  Her assault on Ranko&#39;s senses
paralyzes the lost child as Shampoo fixes her with a determined
stare.  &quot;Shampoo, I can&#39;t...&quot; Ranko feels tears sting her cheek.
&quot;I can&#39;t be the one for you.  I...I can&#39;t be the man you want.&quot;

     &quot;Silly girl,&quot; Shampoo breathes on Ranko&#39;s ear, her hands
drifting to the latter&#39;s buttocks, forcing their hips together.

     Ranko nearly drowns in the resulting burst of pleasure.
Without invitation, their lips lock, their tongues playfully
duelling as their embrace tightens to the point where it seems
they cannot breathe.  &quot;Ranko understand now,&quot; Shampoo smiles.
&quot;It&#39;s Ranko who Shampoo loves.  Outside no matter.  Inside
matters more...&quot;

                           *    *    *

     &quot;Ranko, darling...&quot; a dreamy voice tickles the lost girl&#39;s
ears.

     Ranko&#39;s eyes flutter open, then they go wide as she finds
herself facing a nude Kodachi, drifting toward her, her hands out
and reaching for Ranma&#39;s sister.  &quot;K-kodachi!!&quot; Ranko gasps,
trying to back away, sweating on seeing the inviting look on the
rhythmic gymnast&#39;s face.  &quot;Kodachi-chan, what are you doing?!&quot;

     &quot;I want you, my lovely Ranko,&quot; Kodachi intones.

     Her hands fall on Ranko&#39;s shoulder as the youngest Kunou
drifts into the latter&#39;s waiting embrace.  Ranko then realizes
she is as nude as Kodachi.  Her assault on Ranko&#39;s senses
paralyzes the lost child as Kodachi fixes her with a determined
stare.  &quot;Kodachi, I can&#39;t...&quot; Ranko feels tears sting her cheek.
&quot;I can&#39;t be the one for you.  I...I can&#39;t be the man you want.&quot;

     &quot;Silly girl,&quot; Kodachi breathes on Ranko&#39;s ear, her hands
drifting to the latter&#39;s buttocks, forcing their hips together.

     Ranko nearly drowns in the resulting burst of pleasure.
Without invitation, their lips lock, their tongues playfully
duelling as their embrace tightens to the point where it seems
they cannot breathe.  &quot;You see,&quot; Kodachi smiles.  &quot;It&#39;s you I
love.  The outside doesn&#39;t matter.  It&#39;s what&#39;s on the inside
that matters...&quot;

                           *    *    *

     &quot;You can&#39;t love anyone else, Ranko,&quot; Akane smiles.

     &quot;You can give us our hearts back, Ranko-chan,&quot; Ukyou coos.

     &quot;Ranko no can love boy,&quot; Shampoo purrs.  &quot;Ranko only love
girls.&quot;

     &quot;Come to us, dearest Ranko,&quot; Kodachi huskily intones...

                           *    *    *

     &quot;YEAAAAAAH!!!!&quot; Ranko exclaims, bursting out of bed.

     She pants as her eyes register the contours of her small
bedroom.  Her eyes then turn right to see Kodachi peacefully
sleeping beside her, protectively curled on herself.  Ranko feels
her heart thunder as the rhythmic gymnast&#39;s unclothed body
becomes visible.  She then glances at herself, only sheathed in
boxer shorts loaned from Ranma.

     A moan escapes Kodachi&#39;s lips as she uncurls, stretching
herself, then she stares quizzically at Ranko.  &quot;Ranko, are you
all right?&quot; she wonders, slowly sitting up.

     Ranko shudders as Kodachi&#39;s well-exercised body comes into
view.  &quot;I...I just had a dream, that&#39;s all.&quot;

     &quot;It must&#39;ve been some nightmare,&quot; Kodachi muses.  &quot;Are you
sure you&#39;re all right?&quot;

     &quot;I...no,&quot; Ranko looks down shamefully.  &quot;Kodachi...I...I
dreamt of making love...to you...to Ukyou...to Shampoo...even to
Akane-onee-chan.&quot;

     Kodachi jolts, her arm reflexively moving to cover herself.
&quot;I...please don&#39;t think I&#39;m a pervert or anything like that,
but...&quot; Ranko pauses, shaking her head, &quot;...I really don&#39;t know
where that came from.&quot;

     &quot;Ranko-chan...you might be a girl twenty-four hours a day
from now until the day you die,&quot; Kodachi lightly smiles, &quot;but
deep down, you&#39;re still Ranma.  Ranma-kun has needs, just like
you do.  Because you were  a boy in body and spirit until
sometime ago, you&#39;re used to thinking about girls as potential
lovers.  Added onto that, Ukyou, Shampoo, Akane and I constantly
threw ourselves at you, did everything we could to get your
attention.  That left a mark that&#39;ll be with you for a long time,
Ranko-chan.  There&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of.  Given your
situation, I could say that&#39;s quite normal.&quot;

     Ranko feels herself flush.  &quot;Thanks, Kodachi-chan,&quot; she
reaches over to squeeze her guest&#39;s hand, &quot;...for understanding.&quot;

     &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Kodachi smiles.  &quot;Now, Ranko...&quot;

     &quot;What?&quot;

     &quot;Isn&#39;t it a little unfair that I&#39;m nude and you&#39;re not?&quot;

     Ranko blinks, then stares at herself.  &quot;I...guess so,&quot; she
rises, then slips off her shorts, tossing them aside.  Slipping
back into bed, she relaxes...then stops.  &quot;Kodachi...?&quot;

     The rhythmic gymnast is now facing her, a hauntingly
familiar look on her face.  &quot;What is it, Ranko-chan?&quot;

     &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

     &quot;Well...you know about those needs I mentioned.&quot;

     &quot;Yeah?&quot;

     &quot;I have them, too.&quot;

     Ranko blinks.  &quot;Are you a...?&quot;

     &quot;Truthfully, I don&#39;t know.  But...does it matter?&quot;

     Silence falls.  Ranko gazes at Kodachi.  A woman who,
despite her maddeningly annoying way of showing friendship, her
desire to dominate her situation, the frighteningly warped
demeanor she normally presented to others, had given her heart to
Ranma Saotome without coercion or some prior arrangement between
their parents.  A very desirable woman, when you ignored the
superficial impressions.  A woman Ranma himself could have
desired if he was not then distracted by a million other
problems.

     But Ranko had no distractions.

     &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; she reaches over to draw Kodachi into
an embrace.  &quot;Not between us.&quot;

     Kodachi reaches up to undo her side ponytail, then they
drift into a tender kiss.  &quot;Mmmmm...&quot; the rhythmic gymnast purrs
as their tongues trace the other&#39;s teeth.  &quot;I actually might come
to like this.&quot;

     &quot;So will I,&quot; Ranko meows...

                           *    *    *
