<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rpgingmaster.html">RPGing Master</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	As Kodachi tossed and turned in her bed, the covers askew from her
subconscious minstrations, it was obvious to any observer of human nature 
that she was dreaming.


	She was dreaming...of her first love.......



	When she had first come to St. Hebereke, she had quickly climbed to
the positon of Captain of the  Rythmic Gymnastics Martial Arts team, and
for a year, she had had little competition, and she was the alpha dog,
so to speak, of her sport.

	That was, until, she met Reiko Kaneko.

	Reiko was a transfer stundent from Kyoko, and she quickly joined 
the team, and, on first impression, Kodachi did not believe her dominance
over the team was in any danger.

	That&#39;s when she learned just how naive a first impression could 
be.

	Reiko had quickly climbed the ranks, outdoing everyone except her,
and only barely, and it was a healthy competition to keep herself ahead of
Reiko, a girl Kodachi had learned very quickly, that had as much 
confidence and skill as herself.

	The two of them were open rivals, and both could be seen in each 
others company, debating in words if not in blows, and their rivalry grew
even more intense. However, things came to a head one hot summer 
afternoon.

	She had been doing some afterschool training, something she found 
herself doing more and more to keep herself ahead of her rival, and just 
as she was getting started, her antagonist arrived, intent on doing the 
same thing.

	Very quickly, they were unable not to snipe at each other, and 
in very short order, they were sparring.

	Usually, in some shape or fashion, they had been interrupted in 
their duelings before, but as they battled, without any interference, as
just the two of them, alone, battled, something began to change.

	Kodachi had always been competitive, but even she knew when to
take a rest break, but as ribbons flew and batons clashed, neither one 
wanted to give up, Reiko&#39;s resolve just as iron as her own.

	After what seemed hours, they had been physically and mentally
drained, the reason for their battle long forgotton, but as they, like
two dying titans, continued to spar weakly, they could not stop, and 
their area of combat shrunk from the entire room to just a few feet.

	After a few minutes more, those feet had shrunk, and as the
full load of exhaustion and pain and weariness took hold, their half 
raised weapons fell to the ground, and their spent bodies legs started
to buckle, and the last thing that they could convince their arms to do 
was grab each others shoulders as they fell upon the gym mats.

	They laid there for a long time, their bodies touching, their 
chests heaving, and as the strength drew itself back inside them, they 
managed to lift their lowered heads, lowered by fatigue, to be level
with each other, and for the longest time, they just stared into each 
other&#39;s eyes.

	What they saw shocked them. They did not see hate, nor malice, 
nor envy, normaevolence, nor fury. What they did see was fire, iron 
will, passion, verve, independence, youth, and.....

	Love.

	When the final secret of their souls had been laid bare, they
gripped each other tightly, their faces mere centimeters from each 
other, their chests constricted with the overwhelment of emotion, and
as the deeply held feelings that their rivalry had refused to let 
surface emerged, their faces touched in a deep, yet gentle kiss.

	Their lips melted into each other&#39;s, and it seemed to go on for
hours, a soulful quality about the kiss surrounded them, as if two dying
true loves were holding each other in a final embrace, and by the time
that each let go, their eyes were not filled with competiton or the
will to dominate, but love; sweet, pure, innocent love.

	That day, it seemed, had ushered in a happy time in her life.

	Reiko was the most wonderful lover she had ever known, althougth
that fact was somewhat comical, given that Reiko was her first, but even
though in the public eye they were still fierce rivals, privately, they
were the most passionate of lovers.

	It had gone far beyond mere kissing. Neither girl was overly 
experienced in the art of making love to another woman, but patience,
time, and their undying love carried them on, and soon they were able 
to make each other&#39;s bodies tense in anticipation and flow with serenity.
In fact, she liked it best when she lay flat, feeling Reiko&#39;s lips touch 
every square centimeter of her flesh, and she moaned her lover&#39;s name 
every time her skin lit up in passionate fire.

	For almost a year they were in love, and despite the illusion 
they tried to maintain, it was clear that even if they were still
rivals, they were now friendlier rivals, yet they still loved to 
compete against each other, but in the end, they still loved one another
deeply.

	Then, tragedy struck. During a competition at a neighboring school,
the Gymnastics arena equipment had not been properly inspected, and, 
during competition, Reiko was slung backwards into a rail, and due to the 
padding being so worn it was useless, her neck snapped on contact, her 
life snuffed out in what seemed the blink of an eye.

	She had cried bitterly at Reiko&#39;s funeral, her sobs overpowering
everyone elses&#39;, and for the longest time, she had been in a depression,
almost near suicide.

	However, it was when she was at her lowest, that&#39;s when she 
remembered something that Reiko had told her not soon after they had 
declared their love for each other.

	&quot;No matter what happens, Dachi...I want you to be happy....&quot;

	Her memory, as faded as it was, as meager as it was, was enough 
to stop her from pulling the Kuno family tanto, enough from keeping her
from committing seppuku, yet she had changed, and her recovery had been 
partially responsible for her transformation into the &quot;Black Rose&quot;.....

	She woke up, and as she awoke, she felt the warm trickle of a
tear slide down her cheek, and she, in what seemed a moment of immense
sadness, bitterly asked the night:

	&quot;Will anyone like you...Reiko...ever appear again.....&quot;

	As she finished her elocution, she felt a flood of tears flow
down her cheeks, and she cried herself to sleep...

************************************************************************

	As Shampoo awoke in the middle of the night, the Nekohaten seeming
almost too quiet due to the abscence of Mousse and her great-grandmother,
Cologne, she found herself unable to sleep as thoughts and doubts she had
tried to bury demanded her attention, thoughts that were free to roam 
while Mousse and her great-grandmother were at an Amazon reunion in 
China.

	In truth, did Ranma even care? For the longest time, she had been
sure she would win him over, discouraging all other suitors so she could
win his hand, but really, her mind kept repeating, did it even matter?

	She had done everything in her power to win his hand; she had cooked 
for him, fought for him, suffered for him, and she had even, several times 
in fact, almost died for him, but he didn&#39;t even seem to notice.

	Also, despite her Amazon upbringing, she was a woman at heart, and
and all she wanted was someone to hold, to love, to cherish; she wanted to
give someone affection, she wanted to whisper sweet proclamations of love
in her lover&#39;s ear, but most of all, she wanted to love someone, and she
wanted them to love her back. As well, to be completely honest, she was a 
woman with desires, not all of them noble, and night after night of self 
gratification just didn&#39;t seem to be enough to cool the spark of lust 
inside her.

	She could never admit this, not even to Great-Grandmother or Mousse.
Cologne would probably shame her for her weakness, and Mousse would 
probably try to attempt to win her heart with even greater intensity, and 
she had no illusion of sharing it with him.

	As she got up, her heart heavy, she forced those feeling back, back
into the dark caverns of her heart&#39;s innermost chambers, and she prepared 
for yet another day of trying to win his hand......

************************************************************************

That morning.......


	As Kodachi put her leotard on, figuring that it would be the most 
comfortable in the dry summer heat, her mind was a whirl of where she 
might find Ranma.

	It was after dawn and almost prenoon, so she figured that since it
was summer, and school wasn&#39;t available as a distraction, he would most 
likely be at the okonomiyaki shop or the ramen place, she thought, owing 
to his rather healthy appetite.

	Once her daily toilet and her thoughts were in order, she decided
to have for herself a light breakfast, and, once that was over, she went
on her way, quick and stealthy as a ninja in search of her fiance.

************************************************************************

	When Great-Grandmother left, she had left instruction that while 
the Nekohaten was closed, she was to keep the place clean, if nothing 
else, and as she put on a pot of ramen (for her brunch and for Ranma, if
he ever happened to stop by) and wiped the countertops, a shadow crossed
her path, and she didn&#39;t even have to notice the whirling black rose 
petals before she knew who it was.

	&quot;Rose girl!&quot;, her voice now somewhat sharp.

************************************************************************

	As Kodachi looked on with dagger eyes, she didn&#39;t notice Ranma
anywhere, just one of her more most antagonizing rivals.

	When Kodachi had first met Shampoo, things had gone downhill rather
fast. She was in love with Ranma, and so was Shampoo, so they were natural
rivals, and the only times they got along were when they teamed up to 
thwart the seductive schemes of any other potential rivals, but otherwise, 
they always, figuratively speaking, had their daggers unsheathed in each 
others presence.

	However, every time Kodachi saw her, she had an extra reason to be
bitter. Shampoo looked so much like Reiko, her first love, and just seeing
her filled her with pain, small though it was, and in her innermost heart,
she always felt a little sadness, mingled with desire for the almost 
carbon copy version of her first love.....

	Despite that, her face mask of scorn as she haughtily repiled,
	&quot;So, where is my Ranma-sama.&quot;

	&quot;Shampoo not know, but she only one for airen, not crazy rose
girl.&quot;, her opponent said, in a sickly sweet voice that made Kodachi
irritated.

	&quot;Really&quot;, she replied, &quot;How could you, a mere peasant, give him
the love that only a true maiden could give to him!&quot;, she concluded,
finding herself enjoying her verbal battle.

	Shampoo thrust out her ample chest, crossed her arms, and in a
snide (yet disarmingly cute) voice, snapped, &quot;Shampoo know how to keep
husband happy. Shampoo cook, Shampoo fight by husband&#39;s side, Shampoo
look better......

	Kodachi was about to go for her combat ribbon, but an evil
thought creased her brow as she said, as if she had parried the killing
dagger, &quot;But...only I can keep Ranma-sama happy.&quot;

	At that, Shampoo had an inkling what Kodachi meant, but she
asked in a confused voice, &quot;What rose girl mean?&quot;

	Kodachi, now smirking, answered, &quot;Only I know how to...see
to his....sexual needs...&quot;.

	Shampoo defiantly countered, &quot;So can Shampoo. Shampoo can 
always and forever make airen happy, and Shampoo willing to prove
it!&quot;

	Kodachi&#39;s expression took on a snake like look, and, her
eyes mere slits, she asked dubiously, &quot;How?&quot;

	Shampoo really had thought of it, but a sudden thought surged 
from the back of her mind. &#39;A test of...endurance...&quot;, she managed.

	Kodachi had a good idea now, and a lecherous smile crossed her
lips as she crossed her arms and said, &quot;Oh?&quot;

	Shampoo continued, &quot;We give pleasure to each other, and she who
needs to rest first, is loser.&quot;

	Kodachi thought about. The prize was her pride, and all she had 
to do was wear Shampoo out. Her confident, arrogant side said &quot;No 
problem&quot;, and her inner self felt a small stab of emotion, but said 
nothing, and with that settled, she leaned forward and asked, &quot;When and 
where shall we begin your humiliation?&quot;

	Shampoo didn&#39;t exactly want to begin in what constituted a public 
place, so she led Kodachi to the attic, where, after spreading a pallet
on the floor, she said, &quot;The contest begins now!&quot;

	Feeling nervous, but trying not to show, Shampoo, who was wearing
a white shirt and purple &quot;pajama&quot; pants, started to take off her shirt,
slowly, just so she could see Kodachi&#39;s reaction.

	As her bare flesh, which was more bare, especially because she
wasn&#39;t wearing a bra, came into view, Kodachi couldn&#39;t help but be a 
little envious of Shampoo, especially because her breasts were a lot 
larger than hers, by about a full cup size or so, but she didn&#39;t say
a word, just continued to watch.

	Meanwhile, Shampoo, seeing that that apparently got no reaction,
she hooked her thumbs into the waistband of her pants and panties, and, 
just to heighten the suspense, turned around as she removed them, so
as to save a view of her crotch for last. However, she did not see that
Kodachi was also taking mental notes on her ass, which, to the gymnast,
was a tad on the large side.

	As Shampoo turned around, Kodachi had her hands on the straps
of her lkeotard, and with a flick of her fingers, the spandex material
fell away, and she felt Shampoo&#39;s eyes on her body as the leotard fell,
exposing her smaller but more curvy breasts, and her shaven sex, as
opposed to Shampoo&#39;s moderately thatched crotch.
	
	Both women took a moment to stare at each other, as predators
sizing up potential prey, then they closed the distance between each 
other, a sharp look in their eyes, which they desperately hoped would
conceal their thudding hearts, as both had had experience, but it had 
been so long......

	Without warning, Kodachi reached forward, and her hand cupped
one of Shampoo&#39;s mounds, and, as if testing it, gave it a gentle massage
feeling the soft yet firm mammary gland stiffen under her touch. Shampoo,
not to be outdone, reached out her self, and she gently fondled Kodachi&#39;s
somewhat smaller left breast.

	This went on for a few moments, just long enough for both of them
to get a feel for the situation, then, just as Shampoo was about to jump
start their competiton, that&#39;s when Kodachi&#39;s lips crushed against hers.

	It was somewhat of a surprise, to say the least, but Shampoo managed
to keep her composure, and within seconds, she was returning the kiss, and
as both women put their arms around each other for balance, they both 
thought in unison, (This feels rather nice.......)

	However, despite the enjoyment they were feeling in their tasks,
it didn&#39;t even make them pause, for while they kissed, their hands ran 
across each others backs, both uttering low moans at the feel of soft 
hands running across bare flesh.

	Suddenly, Kodachi felt Shampoo&#39;s lips drop lower, kissing their
way down her body; first at her throat, then down her chest, the valley
between her breast, her stomach, all the way down to the now unfurled
flower that held her love bud.

	She felt Shampoo kiss along her slit, as if it were a human mouth,
then she felt gentle licks around the edges of her nestled treasure, and
as she grew hotter and hotter, and as she felt her sex grow wet, she was
unprepared for when she felt the invasion of Shampoo&#39;s tongue.

	Her eyes, which had been half lidded for some time now, shot wide
open as she felt Shampoo&#39;s tongue fiercely swipe across her her inner 
walls, and she felt waves of pleasure as Shampoo continued her assault,
as the purple haired Amazon held onto her rear as she buried her face in
her centre, and as Kodachi felt that fierce tongue inside swipe across
her clitoris, she felt herself begin to heat up with the promise of
soon release.

	Finally, after Shampoo gave her sex one last touch, this time her 
teeth directly nibbling her love button, she felt herself release, and 
Shampoo barely opened her mouth in time before her face was drenched in 
Kodachi&#39;s nectar.

	As Shampoo quickly swallowed Kodachi&#39;s nectar, finding the flavor
somewhat tangy yet sweet, that&#39;s when, like lightning, Kodachi was behind
her.
	
	When her and Reiko would make love, the first few times were 
somewhat an extension of their rivalry, and they used to see which 
could bring the other to climax first, and as Kodachi felt Shampoo
rear grind against her crotch, she felt a spark of electricity 
tingle through her.

	Suddenly, Kodachi&#39;s arms pulled Shampoo up to a standing 
position, her hands clamped over Shampoo&#39;s breasts, and her legs
curled around Shampoo&#39;s legs, both to accentuate the closeness
and for stability, and she began to knead and massage Shampoo&#39;s 
assets while kissing lightly up and down her neck.

	As Kodachi did this, Shampoo felt herself grow very warm.
She had had some previous yuri experience back in her village,
but in between her gasps of pleasure and moans, she could tell that
her rival apparently had much greater experience, and Shampoo, in
the back of mind, was wondering how she could make this debacle 
they were engaged in happen again at some later date.....just
then, a particulary large moan escaped her throat as Kodachi nibbled 
her earlobe, a newly discovered, highly erogenous zone.

	As Kodachi felt Shampoo&#39;s body arch, she knew that her rival
was ready, and one of her hands slid down to Shampoo&#39;s moist and
and now completely unfurled sex.

	Shampoo felt one of the hands that had been on her breasts 
fall away, and just as she started to regret the loss of the sensation,
that&#39;s when she felt two probing fingers suddenly enter her, and when
they did, her body, already primed and almost driven to climax by 
Kodachi&#39;s expert touch, shook visibly, and a flowing warm sensation
gushed from betwen her legs as she came, but Kodachi&#39;s fingers didn&#39;t
stop there, as she continued to pump them in and out of Shampoo&#39;s snatch,
occaisonally adding her thumb, which swiped across the Amazon&#39;s clit
from time to time, causing her to come again and again.

	After about the fifth time, Shampoo felt a little weak in the
legs, so she collasped the floor, sprawled flat on her back, and 
began to pant slightly, exhausted from her multiple orgasms.

	Kodachi got on her hands and knees, looked over Shampoo, and
in a lecherous\arrogant voice, she asked, &quot;Do you concede I&#39;m the
only one for-&#39;, and she got no farther before Shampoo pulled her down 
on top of her, rollewd over, so that she was under the Amazon, and 
Shampoo slienced her with thick, bruising kisses.

	For a couple of moments, Shampoo just wouldn&#39;t let her mouth go, 
and Kodachi eventually decided to quit trying to talk and just return the 
favor, as it were, and for the longest time, they just lay there, making 
out.

	Finally, after their lips got sore Shampoo looked down at Kodachi,
and in perfect mimicry to Kodachi&#39;s tone, uttered one thing in reply,

	&quot;Never.&quot;

	Just then, she felt Shampoo move downwards, and it wasn&#39;t long 
before she started to moan raggedly.....

************************************************************************

	Hours later, their bodies dripping with sweat, the two women, 
exhausted more then they would show each other, lay atop each other,
unable to do more than kiss, did so mindlessly, knowing no ryhme or reason 
for their action anymore, their contest forgotten. All they could was lay
there in each other&#39;s arms, unable to stop.

	As they  tried to shift their bodies into a more comfortable 
position, exhaustion overpowered their mindless lust, and they felt their
consciousness&#39; fall away as sleep overtook them both.

************************************************************************

	As Kodachi awoke, she felt very lightheaded and weak, and, as her
senses revived, she could feel another human presence against her own.

	At that moment, her vision cleared, and she realized she was 
naked, her sweat drenched body lying atop the sleeping body of Shampoo.

	She was shocked for a moment, though too exhausted to physically
manifest it, but her memory kicked in and she remebered the contest.

	They had had a contest to decide who would be able to provide
Ranma-sama better pleasure, and the contest was to see who endured
longer, and even though the contest had gone on for hours, neither
had won, instead, fatigue had claimed them both, so clearly, the 
contest was a draw.

	As she slowly downed her leotard, she looked down at Shampoo,
trying to decided what she felt at the moment, and, even though the
disdain she held for the girl as a rival to Ranma&#39;s affections was
still in place, she also felt something else, something more base,
something more primal.....

	Without knowing why, she manuveured Shampoo&#39;s clothes back on 
her unconscious body, then, before she left, almost as an afterthought, 
she leaned over, and gave a Shampoo a kiss.

	It wasn&#39;t a particulary erotic gesture, nor did Kodachi have 
any deep emotional feelings for Shampoo, but it did help her make her
mind, and, with one last look at Shampoo, she then turned, and went
back home to get changed........

************************************************************************

That night.....

	As Shampoo soaped her body, the sticky feeling of sweat washing down 
the shower drain, she could help but wonder about her day.

	The day had started off fairly typically, complete with a rather
vicious verbal battle with a rival fiance, but from there, things had
taken a rather dramatic turn, and the had culminated in her and one of
her bitter rivals making love.

	 Her and Kodachi had done so, obstensibly, as a contest to see who
had more endurance, and by virtue of victory, it would prove who would 
last longer at giving airen pleasure. That&#39;s how it started, but, like the 
plans of mice and men, this one went very astray, and, mere hours after 
their contest had begun, it had devolved into them having desperate, needy 
lovemaking, all pretense cast aside. The only thing about the whole thing 
was, in her mind, that was the most shocking, was that she enjoyed it. 
Enjoyed it immensely, as the lovemaking had been a lot more gratifying
than even her most erotic fantasies.

	She knew the truth, and she wouldn&#39;t have been able to lie to
herself even if she wanted to. Not only had she enjoyed it, but as much
as she tried to deny it, she wanted more. Just then, she felt a warmness
between her legs; just thinking about it was making her warm, and she 
closed her eyes as her hand moved down between her legs......

	That&#39;s when she sensed the human presence.

	Just as she was about to turn around, that&#39;s when a pair of 
breasts pressed into her back, and as the mystery woman&#39;s arms wrapped 
around her waist, she already knew who it was.

	&quot;Rose girl.....&quot;, but got no farther before she felt Kodachi&#39;s
lips on her neck. She moaned for a few seconds, but reason reasserted
itself, and she managed to find her voice.

	&quot;What...what about contest? Neither Shampoo or rose girl 
win.....&quot;

	Just then, she felt Kodachi turn her around, and Shampoo got a 
good look at her eyes. She could see lust, competitiveness, passion,
excitement, and a small trace of some other emotion she couldn&#39;t
quite identify in Kodachi&#39;s eyes, and Shampoo knew instantly; this 
wasn&#39;t about their contest anymore.

	Just then, Kodachi pulled her close and and started kissing
her throat, and as a low moan escaped her chest, she realized that 
she didn&#39;t care anymore.....

************************************************************************

Author&#39;s Note: I promised myself that I would write this, and I finally
have, a Kodachi x Shampoo lemon!

If I get enough good reviews, I&#39;ll write a sequel.

Well, as I say to my friends, and since I&#39;m generous, my detractors:

Have a nice day!!!!!
