<a href="../ranma/dragonlady-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>March 2010...

Ranma sighed tiredly as she entered their quarters. That battle had been 
an intense one for her, first facing the Kyron guy and then that other 
even better Zentradi pilot. She was certain she could have taken the 
other pilot had she had something to shoot back with, but as it was; it 
was all she could do to keep from getting pasted.

The sounds of someone crying their heart out ripped Ranma from her 
thoughts. She headed toward the bedroom where the sounds were coming 
from. She found Lisa laying on the bed in fetal position, weeping 
uncontrollably. Ranma rushed across the room and immediately pulled Lisa 
into her arms. The weeping women latched on to her desperately, clinging 
as if her life depended on it.

&quot;Lisa, what&#39;s wrong Honey?&quot; Ranma asked gently.

&quot;I killed him,&quot; Lisa sobbed out. &quot;I fired the missiles and he was caught 
in the line of fire. Now, Rick is dead because of me.&quot;

Ranma honestly didn&#39;t know what to say. She was shocked to hear that 
Rick was dead. She just couldn&#39;t believe it. Sure they had gotten off on 
the wrong foot, but she had begun to respect the guy since he had grown 
up a bit.

&quot;Lisa, are you sure, Honey?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she whimpered. &quot;He was broadcasting mayday on the Tac-net and was 
suddenly cut off with a burst of static.&quot;

&quot;Oh Honey, I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Ranma said comfortingly as she held Lisa.

Ranma continued to hold her sobbing wife until Lisa cried herself to 
sleep. Gently disengaging from her, the redhead got up and went to the 
phone, dialing Roy&#39;s number.

&quot;Hey Roy,&quot; Ranma said when the phone was answered. &quot;I need to know, have 
you heard anything about Rick?...Oh I see...in critical condition?...I&#39;m 
sorry to hear that, I know you guys are close...Well, I called because I 
found Lisa crying her eyes out and saying that he was dead and that it 
was her fault...yeah, I know she couldn&#39;t have known, but you know how 
she is...she sleeping now. If you could keep me posted...yeah thanks. 
Again I hope he&#39;s okay. See ya later.&quot;

Ranma was relieved that the kid wasn&#39;t dead, but from the way it sounded 
it was still a possibility. She hoped for everyone&#39;s sake the kid pulled 
through. Ranma went back to the bedroom and laid back down with Lisa. 
The brunette instinctively latched on to her again and snuggled up 
tightly.

As she lay there, tenderly stroking her sleeping wife, Ranma tried to 
think of how she would feel if she had shot down one of her own. Her 
confidence would definitely be shaken badly. She knew she would probably 
take it at least as badly as Lisa was and that all the reassurance in 
the world wouldn&#39;t change that. She also knew that Lisa had been under a 
tremendous amount of pressure recently with matters concerning the baby, 
her father, and the SDF-1. With Lisa being pregnant, Ranma couldn&#39;t even 
take her out to get falling down drunk, but then Lisa didn&#39;t really have 
the same problem with bottling up the pain like Ranma had. Perhaps it 
was Lisa&#39;s turn to visit Dr. Koenig. She would suggest it when Lisa woke 
up.

(oO\O/Oo)

April 2010...

Over the next several weeks, the crew worked feverishly to complete the 
repair and refit of the SDF-1 and the ship was soon back to its 
pre-Launch Day status. They had been steadily taking on supplies and 
personnel to prepare for what was effectively their banishment from the 
planet. Lisa was doing a lot better now that she knew Rick was alive, 
but she was still being eaten up with guilt over the whole incident. 
Rick was out of critical condition, but still lay in a coma. The doctors 
were hopeful that he would wake up soon.

Ranma was in her office doing paperwork when Akane knocked on her 
doorframe.

&quot;Hey Akane,&quot; Ranma said, giving her sometimes student a bright smile. 
&quot;What can I do for you?&quot;

&quot;Hey Mom, I have some people I&#39;d like for you to meet,&quot; Akane said 
happily.

&quot;Okay, sure,&quot; Ranma agreed.

Akane entered the office followed by two women. The first, a gentle 
looking brunette, didn&#39;t look much older than Ranma while the second was 
an older lady with deep red, almost maroon colored hair, perhaps in her 
mid-forties. Ranma stood and walked around her desk to greet them.

&quot;Mom, this is my sister, Kasumi,&quot; Akane said. &quot;She&#39;s a doctor. I was 
able to call her and tell her about what I had been doing and somehow 
she managed to get permission to come aboard. I guess we need all the 
doctors we can get. Kasumi, this is my commanding officer, Ranma 
Saotome-Hayes&quot;

&quot;Welcome aboard, Kasumi,&quot; Ranma said, bowing politely. &quot;I&#39;m glad you 
were able to come. Akane&#39;s told me a lot about you and I know she&#39;s 
missed you.&quot;

&quot;Oh my, thank you, Miss Saotome-Hayes,&quot; Kasumi said returning the bow.

&quot;Actually, it&#39;s Mrs.,&quot; Ranma grinned, &quot;But please, just call me Ranma.&quot;

&quot;Certainly, Ranma,&quot; Kasumi smiled. &quot;I just hope I can help out here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you will be a great help, Kasumi,&quot; Ranma said and then glanced 
at the other lady meaningfully, before shifting her gaze to Akane 
expectantly.

&quot;Ranma, I have to confess, I told Kasumi about who you are,&quot; Akane said.

&quot;Yeah, well, I suppose that&#39;s okay,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;As long as she 
understands that it will probably end my career if it comes out.&quot;

&quot;She promised not to tell anyone else except one person,&quot; Akane said and 
Kasumi nodded in confirmation.

&quot;Okay, I guess that&#39;s okay,&quot; Ranma said slowly, wondering what the heck 
was going on.

&quot;Ranma, I would like you to meet Kasumi&#39;s nurse, Nodoka Saotome,&quot; Akane 
said.

Ranma&#39;s ears began buzzing as she heard this and the edges of her vision 
began to get black. She suddenly didn&#39;t feel too stable on her feet and 
abruptly leaned back on her desk for support.

&quot;N...N...Nodoka S...Sa...Saotome?&quot; Ranma asked softly.

&quot;Yes, Ranma,&quot; the older woman said with a warm smile. &quot;Your mother. I 
don&#39;t even have to ask if it&#39;s really you. You look just like me when I 
was your age, except your hair is a much brighter red than mine.&quot;

&quot;B...but...Pop told me my mother was d...dead,&quot; Ranma stammered.

&quot;Somehow that doesn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Nodoka said, &quot;especially after 
hearing the truth about why you left him. I never did believe that you 
framed him and left him to face the punishment for crimes he was 
innocent of. Come daughter, give your mother a hug.&quot;

Ranma stood shakily and stepped into her mother&#39;s embrace. Her mother 
wrapped Ranma in her arms and both of them began to cry tears of joy for 
their reunion and regret for lost years. Akane and Kasumi looked on, 
tears filling their own eyes, both touched by the scene and longing for 
their own mother who had died when they were just children.

(oO\O/Oo)

Nodoka sat on the couch in Ranma&#39;s quarters as Ranma told her mother of 
her life with Genma. By the time Ranma reached the point where she had 
left her father, Nodoka was quivering with rage at the abuse her child 
had been subjected to. At the same time, she was glowing with pride at 
what her child had accomplished in spite of her father. She hugged her 
daughter, her tears once again flowing. This is how Lisa found them when 
she came in, in the arms of another woman.

&quot;Ranma?&quot; Lisa asked confused. &quot;What&#39;s going on? Who is this?&quot; Ranma 
disengaged from Nodoka and smiled at Lisa.

&quot;Lisa, I would like you to meet Nodoka Saotome, my mother,&quot; Ranma said, 
standing and going over to take Lisa in her arms. &quot;Mother, I would like 
for you to meet my wife, Lisa Saotome-Hayes, the first officer aboard 
this ship and the mother of my child.&quot;

Nodoka blinked, and blinked again.

&quot;Your...mother?&quot; Lisa asked. &quot;But I thought...&quot;

&quot;I guess that was just another of Pop&#39;s lies,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;But...you&#39;re both women,&quot; Nodoka said.

&quot;Yeah, so?&quot; Ranma said. &quot;My sex changed, not my sexual orientation, and 
anyway, I do still have a male body sometimes. How do you think Lisa is 
carrying my child?&quot;

&quot;Oh, well, it was just a surprise is all,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;Even in this 
day and age, you don&#39;t see two women that are actually married. I didn&#39;t 
think they allowed that sort of thing.&quot;

&quot;The captain knows the truth and he has been very accommodating with 
us,&quot; Lisa explained.

&quot;Ah, well, it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Daughter-in-law,&quot; Nodoka said. 
&quot;How far along are you? You certainly don&#39;t show yet.&quot;

&quot;Almost a month,&quot; Lisa smiled, rubbing her tummy.

&quot;I was just telling Momma about my life,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Come on and sit. 
I was just getting to the part where I went to the RDF academy and met 
you for the first time.&quot;

Lisa allowed herself to be led to the couch and sat down. Ranma 
continued her tale and Lisa added bits about her and Ranma&#39;s time 
together at the Academy. All three women laughed at some of the exploits 
the two had had while there. Ranma then told her mother about her career 
after the Academy and how she earned the two Distinguished Flying 
Crosses and the Navy Cross.

When they finally got to the point where Ranma had gotten her transfer 
to Macross and had been posted to the SDF-1, Lisa joined back in. They 
told Nodoka about the, at times, bitter sweet development of their 
relationship and how their fears kept them from embracing their growing 
attraction for one another. Nodoka was told of her daughter&#39;s gradual 
education in the feminine arts and about the stress it had put on her 
and how she was afraid of loosing herself. She was told about the 
inception of Rose Squadron and then about the fold and subsequent 
events.

Nodoka cried with her daughter over the loss of friends and was fiercely 
proud of her many accomplishments. She shed bittersweet tears at the 
story of Mars and how that had finally brought Lisa and her daughter 
together. Nodoka laughed at the irony of her daughter winning the Miss 
Macross pageant. She felt joy as they told her of their decision to 
marry and try to get pregnant as soon as possible and felt righteous 
anger at Lisa&#39;s father for not only his orders concerning the citizens 
of Macross, but his rejection of her.

&quot;Ranma, do you think I could see my son?&quot; Nodoka asked.

&quot;Sure Momma,&quot; Ranma said and pulled out their wedding pictures.

&quot;Oh, you are so handsome,&quot; Nodoka commented as she looked through the 
pictures with them. &quot;You are such a fine young man. But, Ranma, this 
isn&#39;t what I meant. I wanted to see you in male form so that I could 
hold my son again.&quot;

&quot;I...um...I don&#39;t...think...&quot; Ranma stammered, blushing in 
embarrassment.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong? I guess I can understand if it hurts too much,&quot; Nodoka 
said.

&quot;It&#39;s not that, Momma,&quot; Ranma denied quickly.

&quot;Well, what is it then?&quot; Nodoka asked gently.

&quot;I...well...it&#39;s just that...&quot; Ranma trailed off again.

&quot;She&#39;s worried about what you would think of her,&quot; Lisa explained. 
&quot;She&#39;s lived as a woman for so long that, even with that gorgeous male 
body, she has a hard time being a man. She comes off a bit effeminate at 
best. Unless she is concentrating really hard, you can tell there&#39;s a 
woman between those ears.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;That&#39;s perfectly understandable. It&#39;s rather 
funny, actually. Tell me, Daughter, did Genma ever tell you about the 
contract he had with me?&quot;

&quot;Contract?&quot; Ranma asked with a sinking feeling.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Nodoka giggled. &quot;He promised to bring you back as a man among men 
or you&#39;d both commit seppuku.&quot; Ranma looked horrified as did Lisa.

&quot;I won&#39;t do it,&quot; Ranma said softly. &quot;I won&#39;t do that to Lisa.&quot; Nodoka 
looked confused, then the light of understanding dawned in her eyes.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t be silly, Daughter,&quot; Nodoka said. &quot;I could never have enforced 
that contract on you. No mother would demand that her child kill 
herself. Genma, on the other hand, would deserve it. Though after your 
tale, I doubt he would have the honor to perform the ritual.&quot;

&quot;You mean you aren&#39;t going to...&quot; Ranma began before Nodoka interrupted 
her.

&quot;Ranma, I love you,&quot; Nodoka assured her. &quot;I&#39;m very proud of you. It took 
a lot of strength and courage to make the choices you did and you&#39;ve 
become a fine young woman as well as a strong and skilled warrior. 
You&#39;ve sacrificed so very much. It would be a sin of epic proportions to 
take you away from the people that love and respect you now when you 
have a chance of true happiness. I did a lot of thinking when Kasumi 
told me about you. I decided that if this was how you chose to live your 
life then I would rather have my child in mine regardless of my foolish 
expectations. Besides, I still get my grandchildren!&quot;

Nodoka&#39;s eyes became wide and sparkly as she folded her hands beside her 
face and gazed at Ranma and Lisa in rapture. Ranma coughed nervously and 
looked at Lisa who appeared uneasy.

&quot;Um...Momma?&quot; Ranma said uncertainly.

&quot;So tell me, Ranma, are you planning on carrying the second child?&quot; 
Nodoka asked, oblivious to Ranma&#39;s look of horror. &quot;It would be easy you 
know. We could have one of Lisa&#39;s eggs artificially inseminated with 
your male form&#39;s seed, then we could implant the fertilized egg in your 
womb and you could also know the joy of motherhood.&quot;

Ranma&#39;s eyes were opened wide in alarm as she mechanically looked over 
at Lisa. Seeing Lisa looking at her with a speculative, calculating 
look, Ranma&#39;s eyes rolled up in the back of her head and she hit the 
floor unconscious.

&quot;Oh, goodness, I don&#39;t think she took that very well,&quot; Nodoka remarked.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Mom,&quot; Lisa grinned wickedly. &quot;I&#39;ll work on her.&quot;

&quot;We both will,&quot; Nodoka produced a matching grin. &quot;It&#39;s Nodoka&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;And Lisa&#39;s...&quot; Lisa added.

&quot;Operation: Get Ranma Pregnant!&quot; they both said at the same time.

Ranma shuddered in her unconsciousness.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Hey Rickhead,&quot; Ranma chirped as she came into the room followed by a 
subdued Lisa.

&quot;Hey DL2,&quot; Rick greeted. Ranma raised an eyebrow and Rick explained the 
joke. &quot;Well, you two are the twin Dragon Ladies, so DL2.&quot; Ranma 
chuckled.

&quot;So how ya feelin&#39; kid?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Like a battloid stepped on my head,&quot; Rick replied and noticed that Lisa 
looked positively forlorn. &quot;Hey Commander, what&#39;s up?&quot;

Lisa shuffled forward and Rick could see the tears filling her eyes. 
Ranma stepped up beside her and rubbed her back reassuringly.

&quot;I just wanted to say...I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Lisa breathed softly. &quot;It was my 
fault you&#39;re in here. I was the one that ordered the missiles to be 
launched. I feel just terrible.&quot; Lisa wiped a tear off her face that had 
escaped.

&quot;Hey, it wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; Rick said. &quot;There was no way for you to 
know that was going to happen. I was just in the wrong place at that 
wrong time, is all.&quot; Ranma shot Rick a look of profound gratitude.

&quot;The guilt over this has been eating her up,&quot; Ranma explained.

&quot;Well, don&#39;t worry, Commander, I don&#39;t blame you for this,&quot; Rick said. 
&quot;If it makes you feel any better, I&#39;m fine. Just a little headache is 
all. I&#39;ll be back up there giving you a hard time before you know it, 
okay?&quot; Lisa giggled in spite of herself.

&quot;You better be, Lieutenant Hunter,&quot; Lisa said with some of her old fire. 
&quot;I won&#39;t have any pilots loafing around taking up space in the 
hospital.&quot; The small smile on her face betrayed her stern tone.

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Rick grinned back. Lisa went over to put the flowers she 
had brought in a vase.

&quot;Has Minmei been to see you yet?&quot; Ranma asked and Rick&#39;s face fell.

&quot;No, not at all,&quot; Rick said soberly.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure she will,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;It could be that nobody has told 
her you were here. She&#39;s rather hard to get a hold of these days. She&#39;s 
become the sweetheart of Macross City now days.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Love,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You&#39;re the sweetheart of the SDF-1 
and everybody knows it.&quot; Ranma rolled her eyes. &quot;You can&#39;t walk down the 
street without someone wanting you to sign a photo or something.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t remind me,&quot; Ranma groaned. &quot;Stupid pageant. It was bad enough 
before I won the stupid thing with guys leering at me. Now everyone 
wants a piece.&quot;

&quot;Must be a tough life,&quot; Rick joked. &quot;Top rated fighter pilot in the 
RDF...tons of loyal followers...free stuff...beloved by everyone. I 
don&#39;t know how you stand it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the price of having all this beauty and talent, I guess,&quot; Ranma 
said airily, striking a pose that would have made Rick&#39;s nose bleed if 
it hadn&#39;t been for her conservative uniform.

&quot;Oh you,&quot; Lisa slapped her playfully on the shoulder. &quot;Stop teasing the 
invalids.&quot;

&quot;Hey! Invalid?&quot; Rick protested.

&quot;You&#39;re right, Sweetie, there&#39;s no sport in it,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I know 
someone it&#39;s much more fun to tease.&quot; Ranma shot Lisa a sultry, wanting 
look.

&quot;Hey, you two get a room, will ya?&quot; Rick griped. Ranma winked at him.

&quot;Well, now, that doesn&#39;t sound like a half-bad idea,&quot; Ranma purred and 
grabbed Lisa&#39;s arm. &quot;Take it easy, Rickhead. Hope you feel better soon. 
Now let&#39;s go see how Momma and Kasumi are settling in.&quot;

The pair of women left the room leaving Rick to his thoughts.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Bridge to Commander Fokker,&quot; Lisa said over the personal comm. &quot;Come in 
Commander Fokker.&quot;

&quot;This is Fokker,&quot; Roy responded.

&quot;Commander, we have an incoming enemy unit,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It doesn&#39;t look 
like a full-scale assault but we are sending up Wild Rose Alpha and Lt. 
Commander Whitehall is currently off of flight status. We need you to 
make up the position.&quot;

&quot;Roger, Commander,&quot; Roy said. &quot;I&#39;m on my way now.&quot;

Ten minutes later, Roy was forming up on Wild Rose Alpha flight&#39;s wing.

&quot;Hey, DL,&quot; Roy said over the Tac-net. &quot;Fancy meeting you here.&quot;

&quot;Hey Cowboy,&quot; Ranma said cheerfully. &quot;You ready to party?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m ALWAYS ready to party, DL,&quot; Roy laughed.

&quot;Good, &#39;cause here come the party crashers,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;You have 
Stick&#39;s wing. Try to keep up with us, huh?&quot;

&quot;Heh, coming from anybody but you three I&#39;d be insulted,&quot; Roy laughed. 
&quot;I&#39;ll try not to slow you down too much.&quot;

&quot;Alright, break formation, Fury and I are going right,&quot; Ranma said. 
&quot;Stick and Cowboy, you go left.&quot;

Ranma and Akane broke right and tore into the right flank of the 
incoming units while Max and Roy did the same for the left side. Ranma 
noticed that they were all the big humanoid gorilla-looking mecha this 
time. They tended to be tougher than the standard battle pods they have 
been facing.

&#39;But they die just the same,&#39; Ranma thought grimly as two of the things 
exploded under her guns. Akane wracked up her own pair of kills and they 
sought new targets.

(oO\O/Oo)

Miriya Perino, the premier pilot of the Zentradi/Meltradi fighter 
pilots, was confused. Scything into her command was three of those 
black-tailed, pink and white Micronian craft. They appeared to be the 
same unit of the one that had defeated Kyron and kicked him off the 
Micronian ship. They also appeared to be the same ones that chased her 
off when she almost had the illusive one that had defeated Kyron.

Kyron had said that she could not beat the one who had bested him after 
she had mocked him for being ignominiously kicked of the SDF-1 by a 
Micronian. She had come to face this ace that Kyron said she could not 
beat. She&#39;d come to prove Kyron a fool. The trouble was, she couldn&#39;t 
tell which one the Micronian ace was. The lone plane with the skull and 
crossbones on the tail was obviously not the one. That one seemed to be 
barely keeping up with the other three.

Then she noticed the markings on the nose of the Micronian craft. The 
first one had a single line, the next had a more elaborate odd curl with 
a line on the bottom and finally the remaining one had an even more 
elaborate angle with a line intersecting the longitudinal leg.

&#39;That must be the one,&#39; Miriya thought. &#39;The one with the most elaborate 
insignia must be the most respected warrior.&#39;

(oO\O/Oo)

Of course she had no idea that she had it all wrong, not that the 
numbers 1, 2, and 4 had anything to do with the skill of the pilots, but 
lacking anything better to go on since they all appeared similar in 
skill, she chose Max as her target. She had no way to know that Ranma, 
the true ace of aces, was flying down to Akane&#39;s level which was only a 
little better than Max and the fact that Roy was struggling to keep up 
with Max gave the perception of Max being that much better.

Max and Miriya began to test each other&#39;s skill, fighting back and forth 
in moves that left Roy behind. This, of course, left Roy to fend for 
himself, which he did. Ranma and Akane continued to work in concert and 
quickly shot down more than half the units that had originally engaged 
them. Having some breathing room, Ranma saw that Roy was in trouble. He 
was concentrating on shooting down one of the remaining units and had 
failed to see one that had moved in for a high deflection shot.

&quot;Cowboy, break right, Now!&quot; Ranma yelled; but even as Roy&#39;s plane began 
the hard break turn, the enemy opened fire and scored several direct 
hits on Skull One. The enemy mecha didn&#39;t live to celebrate its success, 
though, as Ranma blew it out of the sky a microsecond later. Akane took 
care of the remaining unit as Ranma dove down to Roy.

&quot;Hey Cowboy, you okay?&quot; Ranma asked as she pulled up beside Skull One, 
which was trailing black smoke.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine DL,&quot; Roy said. &quot;Took a good hit, but I&#39;ll make it.&quot; 
Ranma was skeptical.

&quot;Bullshit, Cowboy,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;You&#39;re wounded, I can hear it in your 
voice. Get your ass back to the ship now. Come on, I&#39;ll cover you.&quot;

&quot;No need for that,&quot; Roy said. &quot;I&#39;m okay, really.&quot;

&quot;Fury, you go see if you can help Stick out,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;m escorting 
Cowboy back to the ship.&quot;

&quot;Roger, Mom,&quot; Akane said.

&quot;Hey, I said I was fine,&quot; Roy protested.

&quot;And I can tell you&#39;re lying, you macho pighead,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Now get 
that aircraft on the deck before you pass out.&quot;

&quot;Commander Saotome-Hayes, have you forgotten who your CAG is?&quot; Roy 
tried.

&quot;Nope,&quot; Ranma replied. &quot;He&#39;s the guy I am threatening if he doesn&#39;t land 
his aircraft and check in with the medics then I&#39;ll personally drag his 
plane out of the air and carry him to the hospital. On the deck NOW, 
mister.&quot;

&quot;Alright, alright, you win,&quot; Roy said in resignation, &quot;but I&#39;m telling 
you I&#39;m fine.&quot;

&quot;You just keep saying that, Cowboy,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Gunsight 1, Wild Rose 
Lead, I&#39;m escorting in Skull One who took a pretty bad hit. Have a 
medical team standing by on the Promy to check him out as soon as he&#39;s 
on the deck.&quot;

&quot;Roger Wild Rose Leader,&quot; Lisa said.

(oO\O/Oo)

Meanwhile, the remaining enemy unit had managed to make it aboard the 
SDF-1 and find its way into Macross City with Max hot on its heels. The 
mecha landed and rocketed off down the street. A second later Max also 
landed in battloid mode and took off in pursuit.

As he ran into an intersection and turned, he saw the enemy mecha had 
paused as if confused. Max used the hesitation to line up his cannon and 
fire a burst of direct hits into the mecha. The enemy whirled and 
returned fire, damaging several of the buildings in the area.

Suddenly the roof opened up and the gorilla looking mecha rocketed up 
toward the sky leaving behind a trail of missiles as Max pursued it. As 
the enemy unit cleared the ship a burst of fire took it from the side, 
blasting free an arm. Akane joined Max in pursuit as the harried mecha 
began wild evasive maneuvers.

&quot;Wild Rose 2 and 4, you&#39;ve won,&quot; Lisa said on the Tac-net. &quot;Let it go 
and bring them home. Good work.&quot;

&quot;Roger, Gunsight 1,&quot; Akane said. &quot;Alright Stick let&#39;s get on the deck.&quot;

&quot;Roger that, Fury,&quot; Max said. &quot;I wonder why that guy seemed to be 
targeting me.&quot;

&quot;Maybe he heard about your charming personality,&quot; Akane joked.

(oO\O/Oo)

Miriya limped back to her ship only to find Kyron waiting for her. As 
she climbed out of her cockpit, the blue-haired Zentradi began to laugh 
at her.

&quot;What&#39;s this? The greatest pilot in the Zentradi fleet, suffering a 
humiliating defeat by a mere Micronian?&quot; Kyron mocked.

&quot;The same Micronian that defeated you twice,&quot; Miriya shot back.

&quot;Don&#39;t be absurd,&quot; Kyron said. &quot;The one you fought was merely her 
underling. The one in this craft here...&quot; Kyron pointed out the fighter 
with the single line, &quot;...is the Micronian ace. She called herself the 
Dragon Lady. I would avoid her if I were you, foolish woman. You 
couldn&#39;t even defeat one of her underlings, so you don&#39;t have a chance 
against her.&quot;

&quot;Very well, I will defeat the one I fought today and then I will defeat 
this &#39;Dragon Lady&#39;,&quot; Miriya said confidently. Inside she was feeling an 
unaccustomed fear. The Micronian she fought today was truly formidable. 
If this Dragon Lady was better, she knew she would be hard pressed to 
face her in combat.

&quot;Commander Fokker?&quot; a pretty brunette woman asked as he climbed out of 
his cockpit.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Roy asked.

&quot;I&#39;m Dr. Kasumi Tendo,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;This is my nurse Nodoka Saotome. 
We&#39;re here to check you out. I hear you were injured in combat?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Roy said. &quot;Thanks for your concern but there&#39;s nothing 
wro...unnghhh!&quot;

Roy groaned and collapsed to his knees as Kasumi lightly poked him in 
the side he had obviously been favoring.

&quot;You were saying, Mister Fokker?&quot; Kasumi gave him a smug grin. &quot;Come on, 
let&#39;s get this flight suit off you and see what the problem is.&quot;

Kasumi and Nodoka quickly but carefully removed the flight suit from the 
resigned Roy.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi said as they pulled the flight suit down to Roy&#39;s waist.

From Roy&#39;s armpit down to his hip was a large purple bruise. Kasumi 
gently probed the area with a growing look of concern.

&quot;He has several shattered ribs and likely has internal bleeding and some 
ruptured organs,&quot; Kasumi said to Nodoka. &quot;We have to get this man to 
surgery, stat.&quot;

The medics quickly placed Roy on a gurney and loaded him in the 
ambulance. He was rushed to the hospital and into surgery immediately.

&quot;How is he?&quot; Ranma asked, stepping up beside Claudia as she looked at 
the doors of the operating room.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Claudia said softly, her voice heavy with worry. &quot;So far 
all I&#39;ve been able to find out is he&#39;s got several ribs that were little 
more than dust, he has a ruptured spleen and he&#39;s going to lose a 
kidney. They say he may never fly again, at least not combat. They are 
still operating on him. Oh Ranma...&quot; The gregarious, always cheerful 
woman suddenly went to pieces right before the redhead.

Ranma awkwardly put her arms around the much larger woman and held her 
as she wept. Ranma felt the tears roll down her own face as she stroked 
Claudia comfortingly. Ranma didn&#39;t know how long they stood there. It 
could have been minutes, or it could have been hours, when the sound of 
a throat being clear alerted them to Kasumi&#39;s presence. Ranma and 
Claudia looked at her expectantly. Kasumi gave them a small smile.

&quot;He&#39;s out of surgery and we&#39;ve stabilized him,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;He&#39;s going 
to be in ICU for a few days at least, but we are optimistic that he&#39;ll 
pull through. He&#39;s a tough one. As we expected we had to remove his 
spleen and a kidney. He should be fine with the other one. The bad thing 
is we had to remove three ribs as they were too badly damaged to heal. 
I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s as we feared. He won&#39;t be able to withstand the strain 
of combat flying anymore without those ribs. It&#39;s a good thing we got to 
him when we did though. Another half an hour and we wouldn&#39;t have been 
able to save him. The internal bleeding was extensive.&quot;

&quot;Th...Thank you, Doctor,&quot; Claudia said tearfully.

&quot;I just wish I had better news,&quot; Kasumi said sadly. &quot;He&#39;ll be out until 
tomorrow at least. Ranma, why don&#39;t you take Miss Grant home so she can 
rest.&quot; Ranma looked at Claudia who nodded slightly.

&quot;You place or mine, Beautiful?&quot; Ranma asked waggling her eyebrow. 
Claudia let out a half laugh, half sob.

&quot;If I won&#39;t be cramping your and Lisa&#39;s style, I&#39;d rather not be alone 
tonight,&quot; Claudia said softly.

&quot;I&#39;m sure Lisa and I can abstain for one night,&quot; Ranma grinned 
reassuringly. &quot;It won&#39;t be easy, but it can be done.&quot;
