<h1>Drunken Insight (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/caleb.html">Caleb</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/drunken-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>This was just like many of the fantasies Shampoo had dreamt 
about Ranma. &quot;Hmmm. Ukyo sound so manly, like knight going to 
protect Shampoo.&quot; As soon as she&#39;d said it Shampoo regretted it, for 
it made Ukyo let go of her as if she were a piece of hot metal.

&quot;Kimi! Bokuta shoujo*!&quot; (* &quot;Why you! I&#39;m a girl&quot;, the 
irony being that Ukyo uses the masculine versions of you and I).

&quot;Oh? Why Ukyo dress like do then? Think tape comfy bra or 
something?&quot; mocked Shampoo as she poked Ukyo&#39;s bandaged chest. 

Ukyo opened her mouth to fire off a snide retort, but then 
the thought struck her, why the hell do I still wear these? &quot;Heh, it 
sure isn&#39;t for comfort,&quot; joked Ukyo &quot;But you know, they&#39;re 100% 
Happosai proof and when it comes to support they can&#39;t be beat. I&#39;ll 
still be pert and firm long after your topless days catch up to you 
and your boobs finally stop ignoring gravity.&quot;

&quot;So? What good beauty locked in confining cage, never be 
free see light of day? No can enjoy self or be enjoyed by another.&quot;

Ukyo winced at Shampoo&#39;s disapproval. &quot;... You know about 
my history with Ranma?&quot;

&quot;Got good idea, asked Akane when at hot springs after Ukyo 
win.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, that&#39;s where we first met, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we really hit off.&quot;

Ukyo decided to ignore that and then continued, &quot;When I 
first thought Ranma had rejected me I guess I ended up locking away my 
femininity. Everyone knew about how he&#39;d ditched me, said it was my 
fault. That I was to much of a tomboy, wasn&#39;t cute and pretty enough. 
I&#39;d always been teased about that before, but this was the only time 
it actually hurt. I decided that no man could ever love someone like 
me if Ranma hadn&#39;t. So my life as a woman ended and I swore I&#39;d never 
fall in love with a man again.&quot;

&quot;Heh, even if Ukyo no love men bet no have shortage of 
girls.&quot;

&quot;What! No, you&#39;ve got it wr...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me Ukyo no have girls after. Ukyo like Ranma, 
real cute whether boy or girl.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well, yeah, that did happen some,&quot; said Ukyo 
embarrassed. &quot;But it&#39;s not like I encouraged em. I&#39;m not like 
that.&quot; 

&quot;Course not, Ukyo to insecure cause Ranma rejection to 
encourage anyone, even if want.&quot;

&quot;Wait, I think you don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m trying to tell 
you Shampoo...&quot; 

&quot;Come on, Ukyo never ever wonder what like be with Ranma 
girl side?&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Akane, tell me real suspicious how much Ukyo enjoy playing 
with Ranma after find curse. Keep changing only boxer Ranma back 
forth. Must been fun watching jugs fill in over and over,&quot; said 
Shampoo as she nudged a blushing Ukyo.

&quot;...well... sometimes I&#39;d think about our married future, 
and well... if he wanted to... um...or knowing his luck...if he got 
splashed while...um... well, it&#39;d be my duty as his wife to satisfy 
him,&quot; said a now deeply blushing Ukyo.

&quot;Oh, and Ukyo just go along out of duty? No enjoying it?&quot; 
said a grinning Shampoo as she leaned in closer towards her now 
completely red faced prey. Panic rose in Ukyo. It felt as if she was 
cornered by a hungry wolf. 

Suddenly Ukyo rose to her feet, &quot;Well, if I have to anyway I 
might as well enjoy it! Right?! There&#39;s nothing wrong with that is 
there?! Why shouldn&#39;t I enjoy it?! So just back off!&quot; exploded a 
panting Ukyo. 

&quot;*tsk* *tsk* Shampoo think Ukyo protest to to much,&quot; giggled 
Shampoo. Then she sighed. &quot;No see what so unhappy about, wish 
Shampoo been as popular with girls.&quot;

&quot;... ARE ALL YOU AMAZONS PERVERTS OR SOMETHING!&quot;

&quot;Silly Ukyo, perversion just what people make up. Amazon 
girl first explore pleasure of body with girlfriends. Make sense, 
help bind fighting force together. Like ancient Spartans. They keep 
Phalanx work as unit and warrior moral up when away from wife by 
having older mentor take twelve year boy as lover.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s disgusting! I don&#39;t care what you say, that&#39;s 
perverted!&quot;

&quot;... Yeah, Shampoo agree, but it work, Spartans toughest 
succesfullest warriors, Amazon ancestors of Greece borrow some 
traditions from. And Amazons purpose liberate woman, show no need 
depend on man for pleasure. Men just for making babies. Many 
loveless marriage for sake of tribe, but find pleasure with fellow 
amazons.&quot;

&quot;When little Shampoo try make friends no work well, cause, 
well, Ukyo say before. So Shampoo resent. Beat up others and never 
miss chance remind them Shampoo better. Sometimes... very cruel. 
Other amazons then hate Shampoo. Shampoo look all smug, but inside 
lonely. Specially when others start to turn to each other. Shampoo 
realize have no one. And then she come.&quot; 

&quot;First make fool of Shampoo in front of tribe. Shampoo very 
mad, hurt status which all Shampoo have, so try to kill in anger. But 
anger wear off out of village. Find no miss village, stop have to 
worry about convincing everyone on top. Respect red head, she first 
peer give challenge. And no hate Shampoo like others, even though 
Shampoo try kill. She even risk life once to save Shampoo.&quot;

&quot;Found her taking bath in shallow end river. We is fighting 
and she no can escape. Shampoo winning, smack Ranma several times and 
she no even score one hit. Then she go down on leg, me think broke 
bone. But Ranma faking and surprise Shampoo with donkey kick. 
Shampoo head hit rock and fall in rapids. Can&#39;t get back above water 
and keep dashing against rocks, think is all over. Then feel small 
arms wrap round waist and pull above water. We both nearly drown, but 
Ranma finally get us to shore.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo so confused as she put mouth over Shampoo and bring 
breath back. As she tear off Shampoo cold soaked clothes think for a 
moment she going to force self on me to warm up. From behind me I 
feel her naked body press against mine. Her adrenlated heat passing 
into my clammy body, keep me from freezing death. But she only 
bandage bleeding head with shreds. She start up fire while keeping 
Shampoo body next to her. Then pass out. 

&quot;Wake up and is all dried off with blanket over me. Feel so 
warm and comfy, then realize her heat is still against me. Both 
dressed now and she still holding me and giving me her warmth. Start 
to get hot myself and then get angry at her for making fool of me. 
Push off and try attack, but to weak. Ranma looks hurt, but Shampoo 
even more hurt when see that sad look in her eyes. Runs off. Try 
call to her but voice to weak and she no hear.&quot; 

&quot;Watch that night as she train in moonlight. So beautiful 
and graceful, Shampoo confused by strange feelings, no know it but 
fallen in love. Tear Shampoo apart. Want to tell Ranma, but if no 
kill lose status, all that ever give Shampoo value. No willing to 
give up only meaning Shampoo ever have, so try even harder to kill 
Ranma, hate how she make Shampoo confused. Maybe if had told her then 
she would have loved Shampoo... but it to late. You know why Ranma 
love Akane? Deep down, she good person, just like Ranma. She always 
stand by others, even enemies. Not like Shampoo. Ranma hate Shampoo 
cause deep down Shampoo horrible selfish bitch. Shampoo still mean. 
Shampoo still petty. Shampoo still cruel. Shampoo still arrogant. 
No one ever be friends with girl like that!&quot; Shampoo voices had 
steadily been rising in pitch, finally reaching a piercing crescendo 
of self loathing that made Ukyo wince.

&quot;Snap out of it,&quot; shouted Ukyo as she slapped Shampoo to the 
floor. Shampoo looked up in mute surprise at a fire eyed Ukyo &quot;Stop 
wallowing in the past! You don&#39;t have to be like that anymore. 
What&#39;s important is to realize where you&#39;ve screwed up and make up for 
it. You can change all that stuff that your unhappy with. You don&#39;t 
have to be lonely any more. I&#39;m sure you could make friends if you 
tried. And you can start with me. What say we let bygones be bygones 
and be friends?&quot; said Ukyo as she extended her hand to Shampoo.

Shampoo looked at Ukyo&#39;s offered hand and then stuttered in 
disbelief, &quot;U-ukyo mean it, want be Shampoo friend?&quot; 

&quot;Sure thing sugar.&quot;

Shampoo hesitated only a moment longer and then 
enthusiastically grabbed Ukyo&#39;s hand in both of hers and nearly ripped 
it out of its socket with her eager shaking. &quot;OKAY! SHAMPOO UKYO 
FRIENDS!&quot;

As Ukyo tried to pry Shampoo&#39;s hands from her poor little 
crushed one Shampoo suddenly asked, &quot;Um... Shampoo never have friend 
before, what do?&quot;

&quot;First...&quot; said Ukyo through gritted teeth, &quot;You let go of 
my hand.&quot;

&quot;What? Oh, sorry!&quot; said Shampoo as she saw Ukyo clutching 
her now purple hand. &quot;Here, let Shampoo see.&quot;

&quot;Nooo thanks, I think you&#39;ve done enough damage 
already...*gasp*&quot; Ukyo felt Shampoo take her hand in hers and lightly 
rub it as she looked into Ukyo&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Please?! Shampoo sorry, make better.&quot; The desire to 
please in Shampoo&#39;s eyes was captivating, and Ukyo could only 
wordlessly nod as she kept staring into Shampoo&#39;s hopeful eyes. 
Shampoo maintained the eye contact as she slowly began to massage 
Ukyo&#39;s abused hand, lightly applying pressure here and there, 
restoring circulation and releasing endorphins that took away the 
pain. &quot;And kiss to make better.&quot; Ukyo shivered as Shampoo&#39;s lips 
brushed against her hand as lightly as a feather.

Ukyo cleared her throat awkwardly as she stood up straight. 
&quot;Um... well, friends do stuff together, how about we go shopping at 
the mall soon? After all, you need some new bras.&quot;

&quot;Ok, but only if Ukyo get some too. Hmm, what size Ukyo 
anyway?&quot; Before Ukyo could reply she let out a scream of pain and 
indignation as Shampoo ripped off the taping over her breasts. &#39;Tsk, 
tsk. Really should go clasps, much less pain take off.&quot; Shampoo then 
cupped Ukyo&#39;s breasts. &quot;Hmm. C cup right? And about thirty- no wait, 
they getting bigger, about thirty-...&quot;

&quot;WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT WHEN WE GET THERE! HANDS OFF!&quot;

&quot;Jeesh, only try help... Ukyo think... Akane maybe come?&quot;

&quot;After all you&#39;ve done?!&quot; said Ukyo with a raised eyebrow.

Shampoo looked down ashamed, &quot;S-shampoo was hoping... maybe 
A-akane could be friend too. ...Akane have warrior spirit, Shampoo 
admire that. Keep always fighting for help others. Big heart. But 
so insecure, think plain, no pretty, but Akane beautiful. Wish hadn&#39;t 
helped make so insecure in past...&quot;

&quot;Well, then you need to apologize to her, but it&#39;s gonna 
have to be real serious considering all the history between you to. I 
know! I&#39;ll make up with Akane first over that whole wedding thing (I 
think that&#39;s why she&#39;s been giving me the cold shoulder lately) and 
then get her ready to listen to you. Then you can beg for forgiveness 
and treat us to lunch. Once she&#39;s relaxed we can invite her out to 
the mall with us.&quot;

&quot;How bout Shampoo make special bentos!&quot;

&quot;Uh...I don&#39;t think that&#39;s such a good idea just yet...With 
restaurant food there&#39;s no worry about something having been slipped 
in...&quot;

&quot;Uh... yeah, Shampoo guess done that before,&quot; said Shampoo 
sheepishly. 

&quot;Heh, I remember when Akane told me the story about those 
command pork buns you made. She got real pissed off and started 
yelling &quot;its not funny!&quot; while I was laughing my ass off. Hahahahaha! 
Her stuck with a cold and Ranma... ACCHHOO!&quot;

&quot;Hugging when sneeze,&quot; finished Shampoo as she did just that 
&quot;Ukyo catch cold? Need warm up,&quot; whispered Shampoo as she snuggled in 
closer to the topless chef and giggled.

&quot;This isn&#39;t funny Shampoo! Would you quit playing around?!&quot;

&quot;Ukyo seem think funny bit ago.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;But Shampoo stop playing round now,&quot; said Shampoo in a 
serious tone, yet she didn&#39;t let go of the chef. 

&quot;.....&quot; Ukyo looked down into Shampoo&#39;s now serious and 
apprehensive eyes. A gasp escaped her lips as she felt one of 
Shampoos hands move to the back of her head. Ukyo couldn&#39;t deny that 
she knew what was about to happen, and yet as Shampoo closed her eyes 
she found her self unable to even close her speechless mouth. Time 
both seemed to go into slow motion and zip by, so that after a pause 
that seemed to last forever and before she knew it Shampoo&#39;s mouth was 
over hers. 

Ukyo&#39;s body tensed and her fists clenched as she felt 
Shampoo&#39;s tongue invade her mouth. But moments later, its gentle, non 
threatening explorations, made her body relax and her eyes close too. 
Even in its gentleness, Ukyo could feel an underlying deep hunger that 
had never been satisfied. It scared her because she could feel 
something similar stirring inside of her. 

Ukyo broke the kiss, surprised at the instant sense of loss 
when Shampoo was no longer inside her. &quot;This is a mistake Shampoo...&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; said a disappointed Shampoo as she moved back toward 
Ukyo. &quot;Shampoo... Shampoo skiida anta*!&quot;
(* literally Shampoo is saying &quot;I like you,&quot; however, Japanese is a 
very subtle language. Skiida technically means &quot;like&quot;, but is often 
used to express love. Anata is the normal feminine version for &quot;you&quot;, 
the shortened form, anta, suggests more intimacy)

&quot;Are you trying to say you love me?! Don&#39;t make me laugh, 
your just drunk and horny!&quot; spat Ukyo as she moved away.

&quot;What? Ukyo think no one can love her? Just cause Ranma no 
love?&quot; Ukyo stopped in her tracks as Shampoo continued. &quot;Much admire 
bout Ukyo. How many sixteen year old Japs make own living work for 
selves? Most adults someone else slave do things they no like. Ukyo 
better than all them! Ukyo love what do, watch passion put into 
oko...oko...um, miyaki stuff.&quot; Shampoo, sensing Ukyo&#39;s irritation 
quickly added, &quot;Must make best in world! Shampoo love independent 
spirit that follow own path,&quot; declared Shampoo as she took one of 
Ukyo&#39;s hands in hers.&quot; 

&quot;Ukyo rough and tough, but have good heart underneath. Help 
Shampoo despite rival. Shampoo wish be good person like that.&quot;

&quot;Heh, you only talk tough sugar. I mean, have you ever 
actually been able to kill anyone?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;See, I rest my case. Your more of a softy underneath you 
amazon skin than I am,&quot; said Ukyo as she squeezed the now blushing 
Shampoo&#39;s hand and prompted, &quot;Go on. I believe you were in the middle 
of telling me how wonderful I was.&quot;

&quot;Heh, maybe we like each other much ways. Shampoo feel same 
loneliness in Ukyo which in Shampoo. Know hurts much, want take way 
from Ukyo. And Ukyo no care what foolish others think. Still guy 
dress even others know girl. Mmmhhh, and look so good as guy or 
girl,&quot; whispered Shampoo as she dropped Konatsu&#39;s top to the side and 
entwine herself around Ukyo.

&quot;Hmmphh. You&#39;re just looking for a replacement Ranma,&quot; 
smirked Ukyo. 

&quot;No, Ukyo got much more than that little boy. Like 
backbone. No pussy foot round. Once know what want try make hers. 
Ukyo got confidence, aggressive, like be dominant, right? Shampoo 
like strength like that,&quot; whispered Shampoo suggestively into Ukyo&#39;s 
ear. 

Ukyo then gasped as Shampoo began to nibble said ear. She 
never imagined they could be this sensitive or stimulating. Shampoo, 
having accomplished her goal of creating an opening swung around and 
kissed Ukyo again, this time with much more force.

Shampoo&#39;s desperate hunger was no longer lurking under the 
surface, it was assaulting Ukyo&#39;s mouth full force. Ukyo&#39;s breathing 
grew ragged and shallow as she felt her own hunger rising inside of 
her. Tentatively at first, she met Shampoo&#39;s assault. Shampoo 
instantly slowed down as Ukyo first began to probe at her tongue, then 
picked up speed and entered into a dance with it.

Gaining confidence, Ukyo began to push Shampoo back into her 
own territory. Shampoo offered no resistance and Ukyo soon found 
herself assaulting Shampoo&#39;s mouth with more and more force and found 
herself becoming more and more aroused. The little noises that 
Shampoo started making only added fuel to the fire that Ukyo could 
feel building between her legs.

Those sounds Shampoo kept uttering were pleasing to Ukyo and 
she wanted to find some way to increase them. &quot;Well, lets just see 
what Shampoo was going on about glomping girl Ranma,&quot; thought Ukyo. 
First she backed Shampoo against a wall so she could maintain pressure 
on the back of the amazons head. Then Ukyo moved her arms down and 
tightly embraced her. Shampoo let out an approving sound as their 
breasts squished against each other. 

&quot;Oh man,&quot; thought Ukyo as she felt their breasts grow erect 
together, &quot;Shampoo&#39;s right. No way this would feel as good with a 
guy.&quot; Shampoo started squirming. Ukyo tightened her grasp to keep 
Shampoo from slipping free, but then realized the amazons true intent 
as their tits rubbing together sent a jolt of pleasure through her. 
Ukyo added in her own hip grinding to Shampoo&#39;s squirming to increase 
the friction and rubbing. She was rewarded by the start of a low moan 
from Shampoo. 

Encouraged, Ukyo sent one of her hands down south and 
started squeezing Shampoo&#39;s ass. Shampoo&#39;s moaning instantly became 
more intense. &quot;Hmmm. She really likes how that feels, eh? Well 
good, cause so do I.&quot; Ukyo brought her second hand down to give 
attention to the other cheek, pressing Shampoo even harder against the 
wall so as to not loose much pressure against their breasts. 

Finally the need for air forced Ukyo to break gasping away 
from the kiss. She couldn&#39;t believe that she&#39;d actually done what 
she&#39;d did. But Ukyo couldn&#39;t deny her senses; The taste of Shampoo 
still lingering in her mouth. Shampoo&#39;s pleasured moans echoing in 
her ears. Her erect and heaving breasts still tingling from their 
encounter with Shampoo&#39;s. Her hands still felling, and cupped in, the 
shape of Shampoo&#39;s round firm ass. The hint of lavender shampoo from 
the amazons glorious mane teasing her nostrils. 

Ukyo clenched her eyes shut in an attempt to shut out the 
sensations that were overpowering her, but burned upon her inner lids 
of was the image of herself forcing the naked and squirming amazon 
against the wall. The present was no help either as the musky scent 
of their mutual arousal broke into Ukyo&#39;s awareness and flamed the 
fire within her that she&#39;d been trying to bring under control. 

&quot;Ukyo... sorry if go to fast... just wanted for so long...&quot; 
For a brief moment Ukyo thought she was saved, but then she opened her 
eyes and Shampoo gently cupped her cheek. That touch, however 
innocently it may have been intended, combined with the sight of the 
glistening and panting amazon was to much. Damn that amazon and her 
contagious lust. 

Ukyo saw in Shampoo&#39;s apprehensive eyes the same inner 
turmoil she was feeling inside, only more intense. For Shampoo&#39;s 
desire was warring not with the fear of losing control to that desire, 
but the much greater fear of rejection from her old mistake of pushing 
for too much too fast. Shampoo&#39;s pained expression from this inner 
conflict that was tearing her up was more than Ukyo could bear to 
watch. &quot;Damn you, Shampoo,&quot; thought Ukyo with a smile as she decided 
to embrace the inevitable. 

&quot;Ukyo...ACK!&quot; Shampoo let out a scream of girlish delight 
as Ukyo suddenly grabbed her and threw her over her shoulder&#39;s. &quot;Oh 
help!&quot; Poor virgin Shampoo captured by ecchi brute. What fate await 
defenseless Shampoo in heantai&#39;s lair? Help! Put Shampoo down 
brute!&quot; cried Shampoo in a melodramatic tone as she swatted at Ukyo&#39;s 
backside.

&quot;Defenseless?!&quot; snorted Ukyo as Shampoo tore apart her 
pants, revealing her white panties and giving Shampoo better access. 
&quot;Who&#39;re you calling brute?!&quot; grimaced Ukyo at a particularly stinging 
smack. &quot;Ouch! Cut that out Shampoo! Ouch! Oh, that does it, I&#39;m 
gonna get you back for this, mark my words, paybacks a bitch. Ughh, 
God damnit Shampoo, how much do you weight?!&quot; Ukyo was finding this 
to be a lot harder than she&#39;d imagined. The stairs up to her bedroom 
seemed a lot longer than she remembered. And Shampoo wasn&#39;t making 
this any easier, what with her &quot;helpless&quot; flailing and lubrication of 
the shoulder Ukyo was trying to keep her balanced on.

&quot;Ukyo saying Shampoo fat?!&quot; screamed an indignant Shampoo 
as she began to &quot;helplessly&quot; flail even harder.

&quot;Well, your tushy does seem a bit cushy,&quot; teased Ukyo as she 
pinched Shampoo&#39;s upturned ass. &quot;Seems city life&#39;s making you soft 
girl.&quot;

Ukyo thanked God that Shampoo was now distracted and had her 
hands crossed indignantly over her chest. &quot;Hmphh! As if. Anyway, 
Ukyo seem like fine. Womanly have ample curves. Show ready make 
baby.&quot; 

&quot;Heh. Well, I&#39;m not Ranma. Being ready ain&#39;t gonna do you 
any good with me.&quot;

&quot;Never know, Shampoo got instant Nanniichuan left...&quot; said 
Shampoo with an evil smile. 

&quot;...you&#39;re not serious are you?&quot; said Ukyo nervously as she 
slid open the door to her room.

&quot;Ukyo want be father or mother?&quot;

&quot;All I want right now is you dummy!&quot; said Ukyo as she tossed 
Shampoo roughly onto her futon. From her now supine position Shampoo 
spread her legs wide before Ukyo. This was even better than all her 
fantasies with Ranma had been. Ukyo realized that she&#39;d always been 
the dominant partner in those fantasies, and that she was getting so 
turned on by dominating Shampoo. The temptation to dive right on top 
of Shampoo was nearly overwhelming, but she didn&#39;t let it show. Ukyo 
smiled evilly, better to make Shampoo squirm a bit more. 

&quot;Oh ho. Getting mighty presumptuous, aren&#39;t you bitch?&quot; 
Ukyo swore she a sharp intake of breath from Shampoo at that. So she 
continued with even more force, getting right in the amazons face. 
&quot;Expecting me to pleasure you just cause your presenting your hot 
little body?! You think I&#39;m like some weak willed guy who can&#39;t 
control my hormones?! Your real full of yourself bitch, thinking that 
your so hot that you all you gotta do is flash some pussy and I&#39;ll 
lose control and ravish you. Time you learn who&#39;s in control here! 
On your stomach bitch!&quot; 

Shampoo, who was breathing really hard now, instantly 
flipped herself over. This was even better than all her fantasies 
with Ranma. She realized that even though she was supposed to be the 
tough independent amazon warriors all her fantasies had revolved 
around Ranma being the dominant partner, rescuing her and taking care 
of her. That had almost gotten them killed that one time with Pink 
and Link when she&#39;d forced them to pretend to have her helplessly 
captured with the submissive wife flowers, all so she could have Ranma 
rescue her. She was surprised at how turned on she was getting just 
by being yelled at and obeying.

&quot;This is for all that abuse you gave my ass earlier!&quot; 
snarled Ukyo as she gave Shampoo&#39;s rump a quick hard smack. &quot;And this 
is for suggesting I get pregnant with your child!&quot; sneered Ukyo as she 
followed up with another hard fast smack to Shampoo&#39;s ass. &quot;And this 
is for plotting to turn me into a guy!&quot; growled Ukyo as she turned 
her attention to smacking Shampoo&#39;s other cheek. &quot;And this is for 
trying to kill me tonight!&quot; yelled Ukyo as her spanking became more 
forceful and rapid, as did her breathing.

&quot;Yes! Yes! Shampoo bad girl! Punish Shampoo! Bad girl 
deserve be punish!&quot; screamed an equally aroused Shampoo. Ukyo 
climbed onto the small of her back and brought her left hand 
underneath Shampoo&#39;s ass to push it up into the air. Ukyo&#39;s rhythm 
momentarily faltered as she realized where this put her hand, but then 
increased with even more earnestness as she could feel her hand 
getting wetter and wetter with each blow.

&quot;Oh yeah, you can bet I&#39;m going to punish Shampoo. 
Shampoo&#39;s been a very bad girl. And a naughty one. This is for being 
a pervert and enjoying your punishment!&quot; Each blow was accompanied by 
an upward push on Shampoo&#39;s pussy, thus increasing the amount of 
impact absorbed. &quot;And this is for having bigger breasts than me!&quot; 
&quot;And this is for flaunting them like some slut!&quot; &quot;And this is for 
rubbing my face in it&quot; &quot;And this is for ripping off my bandages to 
take my measurements by hand!&quot; &quot;That hurt you know!&quot; &quot;And this is 
for seducing me!&quot; &quot;And this is for lubricating my shoulder and making 
it so fucking hard to carry you up here without dropping you and 
looking like a fucking idiot!&quot; SLAP! SMACK! WHACK! SMACK! WHACK! 
SLAP!!! 

Ukyo found herself really enjoying the feel of how Shampoo&#39;s 
ass first accepted the smacking hand, letting it sink in slightly, 
then the resistance as she made contact with the layer of firm, well 
toned glutes. Next came the feel of heat as Shampoo&#39;s creamy white 
skin turned a raw red, then faded to a rosy pink and finally back to 
creamy white just in time for Ukyo to be able to repeat the sequence. 

Shampoo had felt a great heat building in her pussy when 
Ukyo first cupped her mound. That hand then pushing against her pussy 
combined with all the reminders of what a naughty girl she was driving 
Shampoo crazy with the desire to explode. The final hard smack of 
Ukyo&#39;s latest litany of offenses proved to be the trigger that set her 
off. 

Ukyo stopped in disbelief as her lower hand became drenched. 
All she could do was stare wide eyed at the convulsing and moaning 
amazon. Then... &quot;Oh my God! You&#39;re such a pervert Shampoo! I can&#39;t 
believe you!&quot; Hmmm, might as well use this stuff, thought Ukyo as she 
started using the liquid like an oil, applying it like a salve to the 
amazon&#39;s abused ass. Soon Shampoo&#39;s rear was shiny like a treasure in 
the moon light that Ukyo just couldn&#39;t resist, but first...

*SLAP* &quot;What do you think your doing slut!&quot; Did I say you 
could get off yet?!&quot; 

&quot;But Shampoo couldn..&quot; began Shampoo as she held her 
smarting cheek. *SLAP!*

&quot;Barbarian! I see I&#39;m going to have to teach you some self 
control! Now there better not be another peep out of you until I&#39;m 
done or I&#39;ll make you&#39;re ass so red you won&#39;t be able to sit down for 
a week! Understand?&quot;

&quot;Hai!&quot; said Shampoo as Ukyo resumed her spanking and the 
accompany litany of sins which was linked with each blow. Shampoo 
bit her lip to keep herself from crying out. She so wanted to get off 
again. Being able to have an orgasm caused by another was such a 
novel and fulfilling experience, but Ukyo had said no, and Shampoo was 
willing to play along, for now. Besides, its was an interesting 
challenge trying to hold it in, and the fact that she was obeying an 
order that ran against her natural impulse added to the building 
excitement. If it weren&#39;t for Ukyo&#39;s command she never would have 
been able to delay gratification even though she knew it&#39;d bring a 
much greater pleasure in the end. Still, she was curious to test 
Ukyo&#39;s ability to follow through on her threat.

&quot;And this is for hogging Ranma at the Hot Springs, I didn&#39;t 
even get a turn with him!&quot; SMACK! Shampoo sensed Ukyo&#39;s rhythm 
falter as she ran out of grievances against the amazon. 

Before Ukyo could stop Shampoo broke Ukyo&#39;s command and 
continued for her, &quot;And this for time Shampoo try kill Akane and frame 
Pantyhose Boy!&quot; &quot;This for time me nearly get Ranma and self killed 
against Pink and Link!&quot; &quot;And this for all times Shampoo beat Pink 
Link so they revenging!&quot; Ukyo pulled out her spatula&#39;s and made good 
on her promise to her disobedient masochist with a merciless pace; 
smack!smack!smack!smack!smack!smack!smack!smack!

Shampoo tried to keep pace as her blurted out confessions 
continued, working there way back to her life before Nerima, 
&quot;timeshaveoffReiZore&#39;shairforinsultandtime
wrestleBanDeidinmudtoruinnewdresscauseprettierthanShampoo&#39;sand...&quot; 
(Ukyo noted that Shampoo had not a word to say on Mousse). Finally 
Shampoo reached the end of her confessions and let the monstrous 
orgasm that&#39;d been building inside of her loose. She swore she could 
feel every individual muscle in her body constrict at once and then 
explode into convulsions. 

Shampoo turned over so she could behold Ukyo&#39;s face and 
imprint it with this release. All of the tension drained from her 
body leaving her feeling lighter than she could ever remember. Lying 
naked before Ukyo, covered in sweat and sin, Shampoo regretfully noted 
Ukyo&#39;s angry face. &quot;Course, now she see what horrible person Shampoo 
is...&quot;

Ukyo was about to chew Shampoo out for her disobedience, but 
stopped as she noted Shampoo&#39;s resigned look, &quot;Ukyo see how horrible 
Shampoo is now? No blame Ukyo for being disgusted.&quot;

As Shampoo turned her head away Ukyo reached out and 
reassuringly cupped the side of the amazon&#39;s face, bringing it back to 
face her. &quot;Idiot,&quot; chided Ukyo as she touched Shampoo gently on the 
forehead, &quot;I don&#39;t care about all that crap. Yeah, you&#39;ve done a lot 
of awful things, but that&#39;s all in the past, what matters is what you 
decide to do now.&quot;

&quot;But Shampoo&#39;s...&quot; Shampoo stopped as she considered what 
Ukyo was saying, then blinked in surprise. Tears started to flow 
down her cheeks. Ukyo still liked her! Even after finding out what 
type of person she really was Ukyo still liked her! All of her sin 
had been brought out to the surface by Ukyo, and now Shampoo felt it 
wash away with her tears. Despite being covered in sweat and cum 
Shampoo felt the cleanest she&#39;d ever been in her whole life. Taking 
Ukyo&#39;s advice to heart, Shampoo drew the chef in for a light kiss. 

&quot;Mmhh, you&#39;re one hell of a good kisser sugar,&quot; murmured 
Ukyo as she cuddled up to Shampoo. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t get so down on 
yourself, you&#39;ve got your good points. Besides, it&#39;s not as if I&#39;m 
some saint or anything, I&#39;ve had a manipulative plot or two against 
Ranma and Akane in my time. Hmmh, you know, if Ranma&#39;s not going to 
be mine I still owe that jerk for dishonoring my family and stealing 
our business.&quot;

&quot;Ukyo? you getting scary look on face.&quot;

&quot;Well, the more I think about it the more I&#39;m getting pissed 
off. If he&#39;s loved Akane all this time he should have been honest 
about it instead of leading us all on... That jerk! I bet he gets 
off on having us all fight over him!&quot;

&quot;Shampoo no think Ranma like that, could have slept with 
Shampoo but didn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s cause he&#39;s got no balls. Plus Akane would have 
killed him. You&#39;ve got to admit though, he has a huge ego, it must 
make him feel soo manly to have us all after him. Hah, well now I&#39;m 
more manly than that little boy, wouldn&#39;t you say Shan-chan?&quot; said 
Ukyo with a leer as she climbed on top of Shampoo and cupped her 
breasts. 

&quot;Mmhh. Yes, Ukyo much more manly than that fem boy,&quot; 
murmured Shampoo as she ran her fingers down Ukyo&#39;s spine. 

&quot;That cads going to pay for leading us all on. He&#39;s just 
like that lying father of his. Making me fall in love with him again 
just to trick me out of my revenge! Ooh, when I think about all that 
free okonomiyaki that glutton conned out of me!&quot; Shampoo gasped in 
pleasure as Ukyo began angrily squeezing her breasts. &quot;Mark my words 
Satome, my vengeance will have you begging for mercy! We&#39;ll show him 
that hell hath no fury like women&#39;s scorn, right Shan-chan?!&quot; said 
Ukyo as she pointed at her unexpected conspirator. 

&quot;M-me? Uh, what Ukyo plan?&quot; said a nervous Shampoo. It 
looked like the relative calm that had settled over Nerima since the 
wedding fiasco was about to be shattered. 

&quot;Um, I&#39;ll figure that out later, all I can think of is ecchi 
stuff right now,&quot; laughed Ukyo as she began exploring all over her 
Shan-chan with hands, mouth, and tongue. She marveled at how 
responsive Shampoo was. Even the lightest lick or brushing of 
fingertips elicited some little noise from the amazon. It felt like 
playing an instrument, strumming here brought forth a deep moan, 
strumming lower caused it to increase in pitch. &quot;God, she&#39;s like one 
big erogenous zone,&quot; thought Ukyo as she ran her tongue along the 
underside of Shampoo&#39;s breast and used circular strokes on her 
stomach, causing the amazon to purr with delight. 

&quot;Mmmhhh, what wrong with ecchi revenge? Shampoo show you 
ecchi revenge.&quot; Shampoo suddenly spun herself around 180 degrees and 
used Ukyo&#39;s thighs to pull herself toward, and then the white panties 
away from, the surprised chefs pussy. Before she could react the 
amazon&#39;s powerful thighs had clamped down around her head and Ukyo 
found herself face down in Shampoo&#39;s crotch while her own was being 
probed by an energetic tongue. To help her tongue thrust deeper 
Shampoo grabbed Ukyo&#39;s ass and started squeezing downward on it.

Ukyo was meanwhile grabbing at Shampoo&#39;s thighs and trying 
to break free, but the harder she struggled the more Shampoo ground 
Ukyo&#39;s face into her pussy. &quot;If Ukyo want breath again, Ukyo start 
licking,&quot; taunted the amazon. &quot;Ukyo no beat Ranma if so slow and 
weak, Shampoo need train.&quot; 

At first Ukyo refused to be humiliated further, but 
Shampoo&#39;s ruthless smothering eventually forced her to give in to the 
amazon&#39;s inviting pussy. It was a struggle for Shampoo to hold her 
release back, but she wanted to cum with Ukyo at the same time. Just 
when she felt she couldn&#39;t subdue it any longer Ukyo finally climaxed 
and Shampoo joined her in ecstasy. 

The two ended up in a pile of tangled limbs. &quot;That was 
dirty Shan-chan. I&#39;d smack you, except I&#39;m not sure which one of 
these is my arm. I&#39;ll get you back, *yawn* but not tonight,&quot; warned 
Ukyo as she basked in the relaxing afterglow of their mutual orgasm, 
savoring the blurred feeling of not knowing where her body ended and 
Shampoo&#39;s began. 

Sensing her partners tiredness, Shampoo leaned over and gave 
her a goodnight kiss to the forehead. &quot;Thanks Ukyo, t-this mean lot 
to Shampoo,&quot; then slyly, &quot;but me see need work on Ukyo&#39;s endurance.&quot;

&quot;Gah! What have I got myself into?&quot; thought Ukyo, &quot;This 
nympho has more and bigger orgasms than me and she&#39;s still rearing to 
go?!&quot; Aloud: &quot;As if. Some of us still have to get up at the crack of 
dawn and prepare our restaurants for breakfast. Speaking of which, 
don&#39;t you need to be getting back to the Cat Cafe?&quot;

&quot;Um... about that... can Shampoo work for Ukyo? Have much 
experience waiting and cooking.&quot; Shampoo didn&#39;t want to go back home 
and face Cologne after her shameful behavior this afternoon. Worse 
case she could announce Shampoo&#39;s mission a failure and try and force 
her back home. Shampoo didn&#39;t relish the thought of having to try and 
out maneuver her matriarch. Hopefully enough family sentiment 
remained that Cologne would look the other way, but this afternoon it 
seemed she was willing to sacrifice her granddaughter rather than lose 
face before the tribe again. 

&quot;Sure. Don&#39;t expect to get paid more than Konatsu though,&quot; 
replied Ukyo with avarice burning in her eyes. Just adding up how 
much extra business she&#39;d get from guys by having a knockout waitress 
like Shan-chan was making cash register sounds go off in her head. 
Ohh, when they&#39;d went shopping she&#39;d have to keep her eyes out for 
something skimpy to force Shan-chan to use as a uniform. It&#39;d be the 
perfect contrast to Konatsu&#39;s formal kimono.

Shampoo snuggled up to Ukyo and watched her face as she 
drifted off to sleep. &quot;Ukyo so cute,&quot; thought Shampoo fondly as she 
caressed her new beloved&#39;s face. What a wonderful ending to a day 
which had looked so bleak and hopeless. Everything had been lost to 
her in one horrible moment, but she&#39;d ended finding a friend and 
someone who&#39;d finally accept her love. She wouldn&#39;t let anyone take 
that away from her, even her grandmother. Shampoo knew there was 
going to be lots of craziness and trouble ahead, but she wasn&#39;t going 
to let that overshadow her happiness now. With a blissful sigh she 
snuggled in closer to Ukyo and joined her in sleeps embrace.
