<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cheng.html">Donny Cheng</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/leshalf-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>	&quot;Ow!  Hey, watch it with that chopstick!&quot; Akane yelled, holding 
her stinging right hand in her left.  Cradling it to her body, she 
could see the various red streaks that ran along it.

	&quot;Wife no learn.  What did Shampoo say?&quot; Shampoo asked gruffly.

	&quot;Stop calling me that!  I did what you said... oh, that.  I just 
thought a little sugar would make it taste better,&quot; Akane said after 
seeing where Shampoo was pointing.

	&quot;This is salty dish.  The sugar is bad.&quot;  Shampoo glared at Akane 
until she reluctantly backed down.

	Akane sighed and went on to preparing the soup for the ramen 
boiling in another pot.  As much as she hated to admit it, the amazon 
was a good teacher in the kitchen.  Kasumi lacked Shampoo&#39;s bluntness 
and style of punishment.  As a result, Akane&#39;s cooking had drastically 
improved to the point where Ranma didn&#39;t have to excuse herself to go 
to the toilet while praising the food all in one breath.  It made all 
the stuff she had to put up with from Shampoo worthwhile.

	&quot;Ah, Wife is learning.  Not too much salt now,&quot; Shampoo said 
pleased to see Akane taking a sip of the soup before adding the salt.  
While Shampoo didn&#39;t need to test the food they cooked every five 
minutes, as she was experienced with what worked and what didn&#39;t, she 
knew Akane was not nearly as practiced.  By forcing the girl to test 
everything before anything and after anything was added, she had hoped 
that Akane&#39;s fast learning in the martial arts would translate over to 
the kitchen and so far it was working admirably.

	&quot;Will you stop calling me that?  I am _not_ your wife!&quot; Akane 
turned and yelled at amazon.  She noticed Shampoo pointing to the pot 
in front of her.  She quickly swiveled her head just in time to catch 
the overflowing soup.  She had to turn down the heat.  She sighed, 
defeated, as she heard Shampoo&#39;s murmur of approval.  *Why does this 
happen to me?*

			* * * * *

	&quot;I hope Akane is okay in there,&quot; Kasumi winced as she heard 
another resounding smack.  Shampoo seemed to be rather freehanded with 
the dishing out of punishment.

	&quot;Shampoo&#39;s very skilled.  She&#39;s good enough not to really hurt or 
leave a permanent mark on Akane,&quot; Ranma said, her worried voice not 
giving much credence to her vote of confidence.  She did know Shampoo 
would not hurt Akane much, but the cries still made her cringe.

	&quot;Besides, Akane is learning.  Ordering takeout every time she 
cooks isn&#39;t cheap, you know,&quot; Nabiki said.  She had been quite 
surprised the first time she tasted the new, improved cooking of her 
younger sister.  &quot;You were too easy on her, Kasumi.&quot;

	&quot;Perhaps, you&#39;re right,&quot; Kasumi agreed.  &quot;I just couldn&#39;t find it 
in me to scold her when she had that look of dejection.&quot;

	*She does look cute with that sad puppy look,* Ranma thought, 
remembering the first time Akane offered to cook and the disappointment 
on her face afterwards.  &quot;Don&#39;t blame yourself, Kasumi.  You&#39;re a 
wonderful teacher.  My cooking has improved a lot since I came here 
because of you.  Some people just learn differently.&quot;

	Nabiki frowned when her sister and Ranma shared a intimate look 
between them.  Nabiki faked a cough, bringing both of their attentions 
on to her and her frown grew deeper at the their blushes.  Something 
did pass between them.  &quot;So where&#39;s your pet?  I haven&#39;t seen him since 
you let Azusa take care of him a week ago.&quot;

	&quot;Azusa caught a cold a few days ago.  I told her to keep P-Chan 
for company until she gets better.  I hope she&#39;s alright,&quot; Ranma 
worried.

			* * * * *

	Ryoga looked up from the table at the sleeping face of the figure 
skater that was the cause of his misery.  He should just leave right 
now.  However, he didn&#39;t move from his spot on the nightstand.

	&quot;Ranma...  Charlotte...,&quot; Azusa mumbled in her sleep.  Her body 
quivered as another cough came out of her lips.

	Ryoga looked on worriedly as Azusa&#39;s body was wracked with 
another coughing fit.  In spite of his dislike for the girl, he felt a 
certain sense of duty to be by the girl.  It was the right thing to do 
in his mind.  Other than kidnap him, she hadn&#39;t really done anything 
bad to him.  She gave him anything that he wanted to eat, spent almost 
her entire day talking to him, and tried her best to make him 
comfortable.  She didn&#39;t even put him in a cage anymore when she 
noticed how he hated it.

	&quot;Charlotte....&quot;

	*Just this once,* Ryoga thought as he jumped on to the bed and 
walked over beside Azusa until his nose touched her arm.

	Azusa woke up drowsily as she felt something poking at her.  She 
smiled as she saw that it was P-Chan.  &quot;Feeling lonely?  Me too.  Want 
to sleep beside me?&quot;  A flood of happiness welled up in her as she 
hugged the piglet gently to her side.

			* * * * *

	&quot;Mmm, delicious, Akane,&quot; Ranma somehow managed to say while she 
shoveled down the food before her at her usual fast pace.

	&quot;It&#39;s kind of bland, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Akane asked as she took a bite 
out of the noodles.  She was so sure she had added enough flavoring.  
Everyone around the table immediately disagreed with her.

	&quot;No, is good.  Shampoo think Wife think too much,&quot; Shampoo said 
after eating her own ramen.

	&quot;Y-You mean it, Shampoo?&quot;  Akane took another bite of the ramen 
and this time savored it a bit in her mouth.  It wasn&#39;t half bad.  It 
was weird, but Akane found herself believing more of Shampoo&#39;s praise 
than that of her family.  The amazon would never compliment her if it 
was not true.  It was only after the whole family was done that Akane 
recalled that she forgot to contradict Shampoo assertion that they were 
married.  By then, she felt it would be silly to say it after so much 
time had passed.

	Nabiki waited until her parents made their way to their usual 
spots for a game of shogi, before stretching her arms exaggeratingly.  
&quot;Ah, a wonderful meal, Akane.  I see you made dessert too.&quot;

	Akane was about to get up and clear the dishes when she heard 
Nabiki&#39;s praise.  *Oh no, not again!  Don&#39;t they ever get tired of 
this.  I should leave.  This is really childish,* thought, but like the 
other times this past weeks, she found herself quietly sitting there.

	*Oh my, not this again.  Nabiki, this duel is pointless.  Nobody 
is going to win.  I should really put a stop to this.*  Kasumi, 
however, like Akane did nothing.  She looked over at Ranma.  The poor 
girl&#39;s eyes were wide open with shock.  *Ranma won&#39;t be able to last 
much longer if you two keep doing this.*

	Shampoo&#39;s eyes narrowed.  It looked like Nabiki was going to 
initiate it this time.  She waited patiently while planning her own 
counter attack.

	&quot;Oooohhh, baby... that&#39;s the stuff.  Mmmm!&quot; Nabiki murmured 
closing her eyes.  In her hand was a pastry which she slowly put to her 
mouth and took another bite from.  She brought other hand to her chest 
and let out a deep breath.  She let the hand lazily circle her chest, 
all the while moaning just enough so that she could be heard by her one 
intended audience.

	Shampoo did not like how Ranma&#39;s eyes were riveted to the area 
Nabiki&#39;s hands danced around.  She reached over on the table and 
grabbed one pastry that she knew was cream filled.  &quot;Oh, Shampoo 
clumsy,&quot; she said loudly, over the mewling noises Nabiki made as she 
&#39;appreciated&#39; her dessert.

	Ranma&#39;s attention was diverted for a moment to Shampoo before 
almost turning back to Nabiki.  It only took a moment for Ranma to 
realize what Shampoo was doing before the gaze stayed permanently on 
the amazon.  The memory of how the two of them hand obscenely rubbed 
their hands against the other was still fresh in her mind.

	Shampoo made a fist and then stretched out her index and middle 
finger out.  &quot;Shampoo very clumsy,&quot; she repeated, &quot;drop cream _there_.&quot;  
Her tongue came out her of mouth and it began circling her lips, 
wetting them in the process.  Bring her hand to her face, she began to 
lick the cream that had &#39;accidentally&#39; landed between her fingers.  Her 
tongue flicked at the cream there a few times before she buried her 
mouth there and sucked the spot noisily.

	*Two can play at that, game.*  &quot;Hmm, did you have shrimp in one 
of those dishes, Akane?  You know how I&#39;m allergic to them.  I&#39;m very 
itchy.&quot;  Nabiki proceeded to demonstrate how itchy she was.  She 
started by copying the way Shampoo had made the V sign on one of her 
hands.  She then took a finger and started to scratch the area between 
the two fingers.  &quot;Aahh, that&#39;s much better.  Hard and fast.  I don&#39;t 
care if I rub it raw.&quot;

	Akane nearly spit her tea out at Nabiki&#39;s carefully chosen words.  
Since when had her sister been allergic to shrimp?

	*Copycat,* Shampoo thought angrily.  *I can cheat if you do.*  
&quot;Aiyah, Shampoo forget allergic to shrimp too,&quot; Shampoo exclaimed, not 
caring how stupid that sounded.  By now, the middle Tendo sister had 
also given all pretext of pretending realistically.

	&quot;Er, Shampoo,&quot; Kasumi said, embarrassed as she watched Shampoo 
reach for the buttons on her dress, apparently ready to scratch where 
it &#39;itched&#39;.  &quot;Ranma&#39;s fainted already.&quot;

	&quot;Oh,&quot; Nabiki and Shampoo said simultaneously as they both righted 
themselves up and finished the rest of their pastries in a peaceful 
fashion.

	Kasumi gently took Ranma&#39;s still form and placed her in a more 
comfortable position.  &quot;Ranma can&#39;t take much more of this teasing.&quot;

	&quot;That the point.  Shampoo need to sleep with Wife to make 
marriage official,&quot; Shampoo reminded them.  &quot;If not, no show face in 
village.&quot;

	&quot;If Ranma is marrying anyone, he&#39;s marrying a Tendo.  And no, 
Akane&#39;s marriage to you doesn&#39;t count.  You&#39;re the one that&#39;s married 
to the both of them,&quot; Nabiki said.

	&quot;Then Shampoo continue until Wife break down and fulfil duties,&quot; 
Shampoo replied simply.

	&quot;Wait a moment, Shampoo.  I remember you saying there was another 
way you could make this marriage official,&quot; Kasumi interrupted the 
argument to add in.

	&quot;Yes.  Joketsuzoku wedding ceremony,&quot; Shampoo replied, catching 
where Kasumi was leading up to, &quot;but need elder present.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, right.  You already act this way when your marriage isn&#39;t 
even official.  Who knows how you&#39;ll act when you are,&quot; Namiki scoffed.

	&quot;Shampoo only want to make it official so can go home and see 
family.  They not see Shampoo for more than one month,&quot; she snarled at 
Nabiki.  &quot;Shampoo promise not force Ranma unless Wife ready when 
married.&quot;

	&quot;Hey, what about me?&quot; Akane asked suddenly.  While the amazon had 
not made much of an effort to bed her like with Ranma, that did not 
mean Shampoo didn&#39;t cop a feel when the opportune times presented 
themselves.  Akane was sure that is was more of an ego thing than any 
real desire for her body.

	&quot;Akane join in of course.  Unless Wife prefer other way.  Shampoo 
no mind.&quot;

	*Other way?*  Akane blanched at the suggestion.  *Okay, maybe 
it&#39;s not only an ego thing,* Akane revised her thought as Shampoo 
leered at her.

	Nabiki mulled the idea that was being proposed.  She didn&#39;t like 
the chances of Ranma holding out before she made a decision on which 
Tendo she would marry.  Who knew how long that would take and by that 
time Shampoo could easily have seduced Ranma.  With that in mind, 
Nabiki pulled Akane aside to talk it over.  &quot;Akane,&quot; Nabiki whispered, 
&quot;let&#39;s do what she says.  You can&#39;t really push her away like the guys 
at school.  And one of these days, she might get tired of your &#39;hard to 
get&#39; routine and really turn up the effort of luring you into the 
sack.&quot;

	&quot;As if!&quot; Akane shrieked, before realizing that Shampoo was still 
in the room.  &quot;As if,&quot; she quieted down, &quot;you really think that I 
would... with _her_?  I&#39;d fight to my last breath.&quot;

	&quot;You won&#39;t have a chance to.  I&#39;ve looked through some of the 
books Shampoo brought with her.  She has loads of recipes for 
aphrodisiacs.  The amazons don&#39;t see any problem in using artificial 
means to &#39;help&#39; their spouses along.  Do you really want to wake up one 
morning with her beside you?&quot;

	*Might not be so ba....*  &quot;No!&quot; Akane screeched out fearfully, 
trying hard not to wonder where her thoughts had been heading.  &quot;Okay, 
okay, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

	&quot;Don&#39;t worry, the only place this marriage is legal is in the 
village of the amazons,&quot; Nabiki said helpfully, misinterpreting what it 
was that Akane was so afraid of.

	Shampoo smiled as the two sisters broke the news to her of their 
decision. Kasumi did not look nearly as happy even though she had 
started the ball rolling with her question.  &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we ask Ranma 
first?&quot;  She blushed as three sets of half-lidded eyes looked back at 
her.  The flat stares of disbelief made Kasumi feel foolish for asking 
such a silly question.  *Oh right.  The chances of Ranma saying no to 
marrying a girl like Shampoo were not very high in the least bit.*

	&quot;Shampoo send letter to great-grandmother one week ago.  Elder be 
here tomorrow.&quot;

	&quot;But that was when you just declared me and Ranma as your wives,&quot; 
Akane said, her anger building up.  &quot;You can&#39;t mean that you were 
sure...&quot;

	Shampoo waved her hand at the shocked looks Akane shared with her 
sisters.  &quot;Shampoo sure Ranma or Akane break down, so call early.  
Shampoo hot babe, no?&quot; Shampoo asked, grinning so that her teeth showed 
as she watched Akane.

	&quot;...No,&quot; Akane replied, her mouth feeling dry.

	Shampoo smirked at her second wife&#39;s hesitation, before adopting 
a sterner demeanor.  &quot;Wife talk out of place.  Shampoo marry Akane, not 
Akane marry Shampoo.  Big difference.&quot;

	&quot;Huh, what did I miss?&quot; Ranma asked as she woke up to a bickering 
Akane and Shampoo.

	&quot;Congrats, Ranma.  We&#39;re going to marry you off to Shampoo.&quot;

	&lt;Wham&gt;

	&quot;Nabiki, really,&quot; Kasumi scolded as she went over to make sure 
Ranma hadn&#39;t hit her head when she fainted for the second time in one 
day.

			* * * * *

	&quot;I&#39;ll kill her!  She used some Chinese magic or something on 
you.&quot;

	&quot;Kodachi, wait.  She didn&#39;t do anything to me,&quot; Ranma said in a 
soothing voice, calming her friend down.  &quot;It was Nabiki who came up 
with the idea.  Um, you see, I didn&#39;t tell you this before, but Shampoo 
has been trying to sneak into bed with me since she got here.  It seems 
that even though she gave me the Kiss of Marriage, it&#39;s not exactly 
official and she can&#39;t ever go home and see her family until it is.  
The act of consummation would seal the deal.&quot;

	&quot;That slut!&quot; Kodachi shouted and jumped to her feet again, but 
her friend&#39;s hand was firm on her arm.  Grudgingly, Kodachi sat back 
down on the chair.

	&quot;A wedding ceremony would also work which is why I asked you to 
be my witness.  It&#39;s sort of like a maid of honor from what they tell 
me.  Amazon law prevents Kasumi and Nabiki, who are related to Akane 
who is also getting married, from being witnesses so we both decided to 
ask you.&quot;

	&quot;Sorry for my outburst, Ranma.  It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t like to 
see you being pushed into something.  You&#39;re my friend and I don&#39;t want 
to see that.&quot;

	&quot;Oh, Kodachi,&quot; Ranma sighed happily.  She let go of her grip on 
her friend&#39;s arm while she gave Kodachi a hug and completely missed the 
fear in her eyes in the process.  Ranma blushed as she didn&#39;t know how 
to tell the prim and proper Gymnast this.  &quot;I think you know by now 
that I like girls, Kodachi.  I don&#39;t really mind, so you can stop 
trying to fix me up with Ran.  Yes, I know what you&#39;ve been planning.  
You weren&#39;t very subtle.&quot;

	&quot;I-I just want you to be happy,&quot; Kodachi stuttered.  She remained 
silent for a moment before her curiosity got the better of her.  &quot;I 
knew about your preference.  Akane told me after you were kissed by 
that Mikado creep because I didn&#39;t know why you responded so violently 
at the time,&quot; Kodachi paused again, not sure how Ranma would take her 
question, but she had to know.

	&quot;Did you become friends with me because you were attracted to 
me?&quot; she asked, not sure what she wanted the answer to be.

	&quot;Ah,&quot; Ranma scratched the back of her head while she stared at 
her feet.  &quot;No, yes, I don&#39;t know.  I mean I&#39;m always attracted to 
girls, but I don&#39;t go out of my way to make friends with all of the 
ones I meet on the street.  There was something about you that made me 
act differently when I first met you, though.&quot;

	&quot;But you found me attractive?  You still do?&quot; Kodachi asked, her 
voice oddly quiet.  She could feel the barrier she had placed between 
herself and Ranma starting to break.  *Sorry, Mother, but if Ranma 
feels the same way....*

	&quot;Yes!&quot; Ranma blurted out as she raised her head to look at 
Kodachi.  She blushed and her eyes went back to looking at her feet.  
&quot;But, the more I spent time with you, I found myself liking you for 
other reasons.  Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t try anything that you&#39;re not 
comfortable with.  I have enough problems with the girls at home.  I&#39;m 
willing to stay just being your friend if you&#39;ll have me.&quot;

	Kodachi did something she had never done before even though her 
acting out of character had become an all too common thing since she 
met Ranma.  Kodachi ignored the voices of her mother in her head.  The 
only thing present in her mind was the resounding idea of that Ranma 
liked her.  The idea that her friend had wanted to get into her panties 
was an altogether unfamiliar concept.  One that no matter how much the 
voice of her mother screamed at her, she didn&#39;t dislike.  And now Ranma 
was offering to &#39;just be friends&#39; while she went off and married that 
Chinese hussy.  *I think not.*

	&quot;Ohohoho!  Ranma, what makes you think I won&#39;t be your friend 
because of something so trivial.  I just wanted to know because I hope 
you like me more than just for my looks.  Of course, I&#39;ll be your 
witness.  I wouldn&#39;t dream of letting anyone else see you married off.&quot;  
*Fat chance.  This farce of a wedding will not finish, if I have 
anything to say about it.*

	Ranma shivered pleasantly at the sound of her friend&#39;s laughter.  
Kodachi rarely laughed like this around her and when she did, Ranma 
found it to somehow fit more neatly with the girl she first met.  She 
wondered sometimes if her presence had forced her friend to conform to 
her sensibilities too much so that Kodachi lost her own personality.  
&quot;Thank-you, Kodachi.&quot;

	&quot;No problem at all,&quot; Kodachi smirked.  &quot;Here, let me see you 
home.  If I&#39;m to be your witness, I might as well get more of a _feel_ 
for things at your home.&quot;

	&quot;Okay,&quot; Ranma answered meekly as she felt a hand on her rump 
after Kodachi emphasized the word &#39;feel&#39;.  She thought it might have 
been her imagination, but the hand remained firmly planted on her round 
posterior as the two of them left the house.  Kodachi, it seemed, 
intended to lead them the entire way home with her hand there.

&lt;Sigh&gt;  *Do whatever you want, Kodachi.*

	Kodachi blinked.  *That you, Mother?*  No answer came back.  
*Thank-you,* she thought reverently.  She then turned and looked the 
cute red faced girl beside her.  The old Kodachi was back and the prize 
this time was worth more to her than some rusty old gymnastics trophy.  
Her opponents better beware.

			* * * * *

	Nabiki looked at the mud pit Shampoo was single handedly building 
in their dojo.  &quot;What in the world are you doing?&quot;

	Shampoo finished pouring another bucket of water into the large 
box of dirt, before turning to answer Nabiki, &quot;Shampoo get ready for 
ceremony of course.&quot;  Shampoo saw the blank look on Nabiki&#39;s face and 
reached into her clothes for the book of the standard Chinese Amazonian 
traditions.

	*Just how deep is that cleavage?* Nabiki wondered as Shampoo 
produced another item from under that tight dress of hers.  She turned 
her attention to the book in front of her.  After flipping through the 
pages she caught sight of the chapter on wedding ceremonies.

	&quot;At dawn, the future-bride is to be cleansed by the purity of 
combat and in the embrace of our earthly mother in the form in which 
she first came into this world.&quot;  The passage went on to describe what 
each of the participants would do.  It took only a moment for Nabiki 
translate what the passage meant exactly.  &quot;In other words, we mud 
wrestle with Ranma in the nude?&quot;

	&quot;Not that simple!&quot; Shampoo said, shocked at how plain Nabiki was 
making her ancestral customs to be.  &quot;Mean much more than Mercenary 
Girl say.&quot;

	&quot;Whatever,&quot; Nabiki replied.  *Hmm, this ceremony, might not be so 
bad after all.*  &quot;You mind if I borrow this book?&quot;

			* * * * *

	&quot;Are you sure, we should be doing this?&quot; Kasumi asked, not 
feeling right that they were keeping secrets from Akane and Ranma.  The 
two were currently out on a grocery shopping trip and wouldn&#39;t be back 
for some time.

	&quot;Ranma won&#39;t object.  Akane on the other hand is a prude,&quot; 
Kodachi said, agreeing with Nabiki.  After finding out what entailed in 
this wedding ceremony and that the exact legal ramifications of the 
marriage were non-existent, Kodachi had decided maybe letting the 
ceremony run its course was not a bad thing.  In fact, she was looking 
forward to it very much.

	&quot;Besides, it&#39;ll be more fun for them to be in the dark.  This is 
their wedding day, remember,&quot; Nabiki said, her grin very similar to 
Kodachi&#39;s own.

	&quot;Oh my, does this amazon ceremonial battle dress look like what I 
think it looks like?&quot;

	Kodachi looked at the picture and blinked.  These amazons were 
more modern in their ideas, than she gave credit for.  &quot;Yes, I do 
believe that is indeed a bra and those, panties.&quot;

	&quot;It looks like when we are not be in our birthday suits, that is 
what we wear for the other &#39;combat&#39; activities.  I don&#39;t like the sound 
of this.  We&#39;re suppose to have an initiation test at the end.&quot;

	&quot;The future-bride is to walk her way through a gauntlet composed 
of her peers.  Each will take turns punishing the warrior and she will 
have a chance to do the same should she survive to the other side of 
the gauntlet,&quot; Kodachi read.  That didn&#39;t sound pleasant.

	&quot;Ah,&quot; Kasumi blushed as she read how the weapons for the gauntlet 
were to be prepared.

	Kasumi looked at the picture of the weapon that she had first 
taken to be a very fat club.  &quot;A pillow?&quot;

	Nabiki turned to look at Shampoo where she sat with a frown.  &quot;We 
strip down to our bra and panties and have a pillow fight?&quot;

	*Please give me strength,* Shampoo looked up and prayed.  She 
hated how these Japanese were making light of centuries old customs.  
&quot;This ancient ritual and ancestors know what they thinking.  Want to 
preserve amazon heritage but not hurt wife since day of happiness.  So 
come up with battle but no one get hurt.&quot;

	&quot;Whatever,&quot; Kodachi muttered.  Her reaction to the marriage might 
have been dulled by the pact she had learned between Shampoo and the 
Tendos, but she still didn&#39;t have to like it.  &quot;Ohohoho!  Look at this 
page.  The amazons certainly know how the plan a dinner.&quot;

	Nabiki studied Kodachi carefully as the gymnast conversed with an 
embarrassed Kasumi.  *What is it about Kodachi that&#39;s different today?  
I can&#39;t put my finger on it.  It&#39;s like she&#39;s two different people.  
She was never this forward before.  And that laugh,* Nabiki thought, 
chilled to the bone, although strangely not unpleasantly so.  *In fact, 
she&#39;s resembling the profile I gathered on her more and more and less 
like the misunderstood gymnast role she&#39;s shown to us.  Could she have 
been restraining herself this entire time for Ranma?  I think Ranma was 
probably the only the only one that didn&#39;t know how Kodachi felt.  The 
wedding could have pushed Kodachi over the edge and she decided to step 
up her game plan.*

	Kodachi turned to look at Nabiki, amused at examination being 
conducted.  *You should be wary, Nabiki.  If everything goes right, I 
might just steal Ranma-chan from under your nose at this ceremony.*

			* * * * *

	&quot;Akane, move out!&quot; Ranma said, pushing the other girl away from 
her.  Just in time so that they narrowly missed being hit from above 
from a long staff.  Ranma blinked as the staff stayed upright.  Moving 
closer to it, she noticed that there was something or rather someone 
hanging on it.  &quot;Eww, what is that thing... ouch, what&#39;d you hit me for 
you old ghoul.&quot;

	&quot;Good instincts, not bad.  You&#39;ll make a fine addition to the 
tribe, daughter-in-law,&quot; the old woman cackled.

	&quot;Daughter-in-law?&quot; Akane asked, bewildered as Ranma was..

	&quot;Ah, you must be my other new daughter-in-law.  My great-
granddaughter was right; you are quite slow.  I can see that you have 
some strength though.  I can work with that.&quot;

	&quot;Great-granddaughter?  You&#39;re Shampoo&#39;s great-grandmother,&quot; Akane 
said, catching on.  &quot;She said you would be here today.&quot;

	&quot;Brains, too, I like that.  Nice big hips too.  I can see that 
you&#39;ll be the child bearing one of the three,&quot; Cologne said as went 
around the flabbergasted girl to look at her behind.

	&quot;Hey, stop that!&quot; Ranma said, having had enough of the old 
woman&#39;s words.  She was surprised as the woman suddenly disappeared.

	&quot;Hehe, you&#39;re a hundred years too young to challenge me girl,&quot; 
Cologne said from atop Ranma&#39;s head.  Cologne easily jumped over the 
girl&#39;s next attack and began racing away.

	&quot;Why you!  Come back here!  Akane, you go home first,&quot; Ranma said 
quickly to her fianc&eacute;e before racing after the woman.

			* * * * *

	&quot;What took you so long?&quot;

	Cologne blinked.  Now that was unexpected.  She turned around to 
see Ranma standing there looking confidently at her.  &quot;Better than not 
bad.  It&#39;s no wonder you beat Shampoo so easily even if she was 
overconfident your fight, girl, or should I say boy?&quot;

	&quot;Y-You know?&quot; Ranma asked, nearly slipping off of the roof top 
she stood on along with Cologne.

	&quot;Of course, I know about Jusenkyo.  I have lived in the area for 
over a hundred years.  When Shampoo told me of her wife changing into a 
man, I pieced that together the fact that you were with the guide in 
the village, and figured it out.&quot;

	&quot;Are you going to tell her?&quot; Ranma asked, wondering what this 
woman might be up to.

	&quot;Tell her what?  Her wife doesn&#39;t turn into a man; her wife is a 
man that turns into a woman?  I don&#39;t think she would mind, but I think 
I&#39;ll leave it up to you, boy.  She does want children after all.&quot;

	&quot;Thanks, but I&#39;m a girl,&quot; Ranma said firmly, &quot;and the children 
will have to be from someone else.

	&quot;Oh, really?  Shampoo does have an admirer from home.  I don&#39;t 
think he would mind performing... ah, I see you do care,&quot; Cologne said 
mildly as Ranma scowled at her and formed a fist with one hand.  &quot;Also, 
I can see from the way you move that you aren&#39;t too sure of your gender 
yet, so a child from you and Shampoo may still be in the cards.&quot;

	&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

	&quot;I think you&#39;ll find out soon enough,&quot; Cologne answered 
evasively.  *Soon enough indeed.  I think Mousse will be here soon.  
This should get interesting.  We&#39;ll just see how much of a &#39;woman&#39; you 
really are, Saotome Ranma.*

			* * * * *

	Ranma frowned as the group of girls giggled behind her.  Every 
time she looked back at them they would giggle some more and the 
whispers would grow louder.  Shampoo apparently _didn&#39;t_ mind that she 
was born a boy, but at Ranma&#39;s shocked look, said that her female form 
was preferable.  She was suspicious if that were true or not.  She had 
seen admiration of her male body in Shampoo&#39;s eyes when she had caught 
one of times that Ranma had taken a bath in hot water.

	&quot;Don&#39;t mind them, Ranma.  They are _little_ girls.  Let them have 
their childish fun, while we adults do something more interesting,&quot; 
Kodachi purred into the redhead&#39;s ears quietly.

	Ranma blushed and quickly turned around her head.  The giggling 
continued.  *Good, they didn&#39;t hear.  What&#39;s up with Kodachi?  She been 
like a different person this past week.*

	&quot;Kodachi-chan, it isn&#39;t proper,&quot; Kasumi said horrified at the 
outward display of affection Kodachi was giving to Ranma.  *It&#39;s lucky 
that Nabiki and the other two are occupied with their gossip or there 
could be trouble.*

	*Damn, forgot about her,* Kodachi said as she straightened up, 
but still walking very close to Ranma.  &quot;You&#39;re welcome to join in, 
Kasumi.  I did say us adults,&quot; Kodachi said, hoping to scare the old 
fashioned girl away.  To her surprise, Kasumi actually took a step 
towards her before quickly taking two steps backwards and settled into 
a walk a little farther away from them.

	Cologne shook her head at the proceedings.  *Was I ever that 
young?*  &quot;So, has everyone gotten everything for the ceremony, 
tomorrow?&quot;

	&quot;I could have done all the battle dresses up for all of us, 
myself,&quot; Kasumi said.  She still couldn&#39;t believe what the bill came up 
to.

	&quot;Maybe, but this way was faster and leaves us time to prepare for 
other things like the feast.  Besides, you are all witnesses for my 
great-granddaughter.  It is my duty to provide some of the items for 
the ceremony.&quot;

	&quot;Ceremony?  Don&#39;t make me laugh, you old ghoul.  Shampoo is my 
fianc&eacute;e!  Saotome, prepare to meet your maker!&quot; a voice declared out 
from above.

	Ranma jumped out of the way as a boy in a long white robe dropped 
down in front of her.  However, he was facing the other direction.  
&quot;Um, I&#39;m right here.&quot;

	&quot;I knew that,&quot; the man blustered as he turned around in the 
direction of the sound.  He quickly put his glasses back on.  It was a 
girl.  &quot;You are Saotome Ranma!?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, what of it?&quot; Ranma asked, annoyed at the shocked look the 
bespectacled boy was giving her.

	&quot;I thought you were a boy.  I mean, you are supposed to marry, 
Shampoo, right?&quot; he asked confusedly.

	Shampoo who had been watching from the sidelines, couldn&#39;t 
believe her luck.  *Why didn&#39;t I think of this before?*  &quot;Mousse, yes, 
Ranma, Shampoo wife.  Do know why Shampoo ignore Mousse now?  Like 
girls.&quot;

	&quot;B-But...,&quot; Mousse stuttered.  He had never seen any indication 
of Shampoo&#39;s preference before.  There hadn&#39;t been anyone else, be it 
boy or girl, in the village though that Shampoo had shown any interest 
to.  He had just assumed that Shampoo liked men.  *She does like men!  
She has to.  It must be the girl that has brainwashed her.*

	Ranma was suddenly blown backwards as the man in the robes took a 
swipe at her.  *He&#39;s fast!*

	Mousse was shocked as the girl easily stopped his next attack.  
&quot;What the..., so it seems you&#39;re quite fast as well.&quot;

	Ranma&#39;s anger flared as she looked at the training toilet in 
Mousse&#39;s hands that she had stopped from hitting her.  The boy had been 
fast enough to move it quickly enough that it blurred from sight and 
she didn&#39;t notice it the first time around.  &quot;I&#39;m good,&quot; Ranma said 
simply, keeping her eyes on the man before her.

	&quot;Not good enough though.  I challenge you to a battle for 
Shampoo,&quot;

	&quot;Shampoo not for...&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s a deal,&quot; Ranma said, biting her tongue.  *Sorry, Shampoo.  
The Anything Goes School dictates that I must accept all challenges.  
Plus, this guy is starting to bug the hell out of me.*

	Shampoo stared incredulously as her wife met Mousse&#39;s oncoming 
rush.  *What is Ranma thinking?  Doesn&#39;t she care about what I feel?  
You and I are going to have a long talk when we get home, Ranma.*

	&quot;The both of them are quite skilled,&quot; Kodachi said, her emotions 
conflicting with how she wanted the fight to end.  She didn&#39;t care 
about Shampoo but she did care if Ranma got hurt or not.

	&quot;But Ranma is going to lose,&quot; Akane said after analyzing the 
ongoing fight.  *I didn&#39;t notice it before, but your style, Ranma... 
it&#39;s still that of a boy.*

	&quot;Ranma isn&#39;t going to lose,&quot; Nabiki said confidently.  &quot;I&#39;ve seen 
the way she acts.  Even in sparring sessions against you or Kodachi, 
Ranma doesn&#39;t like to lose.  Remember, the Martial Arts Figure Skating 
match?&quot;

	Ranma was losing.  It was a fact that she couldn&#39;t deny, as 
Mousse&#39;s fist slammed into her face.  She tried counter punching and 
missed, falling short of the target by a few inches.  Her arm was too 
short.  Her mind might be that of a girl&#39;s but it had been trained to 
fight as a boy.  *I hate to do this, but I do _not_ lose.  Ever.*  
&quot;Shampoo, what did you say?  You like Mousse?&quot;

	&quot;Shampoo, you mean it?&quot; Mousse asked, momentarily stopping his 
attack only to feel Ranma&#39;s fist plant him solidly on the jaw, causing 
his glasses to fall off in the process.  He was now effectively blind.  
Not the conditions he wanted to be in if this fight were to continue.  
&quot;You scoundrel!  This isn&#39;t over between us, Saotome.  I&#39;ll be back 
tomorrow to finish you off.&quot;

			* * * * *

	Ranma couldn&#39;t face her friends as she stared out into the 
expanse of the dojo, alone.  The mud pit was the only other thing in 
the room and it stared back at him.  *This is what Cologne meant before 
about me not sure of my gender.  My body is acting as if I was still 
male, even when I&#39;m a girl.*

	&quot;Boy, what&#39;s this I hear about you almost losing today,&quot; Genma 
demanded to know as he entered the dojo.  &quot;Are you disgracing our art?&quot;

	&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t lose, did I?  Almost doesn&#39;t count, is what you 
always told me,&quot; Ranma said, her cheeks flushing with anger.  However, 
it was directed at Mousse and herself, rather than her pop.

	&quot;It does when you have to fight the guy again tomorrow.  Akane 
told me the reason you lost.  You know should know what to do,&quot; Genma 
said gruffly.  Hopefully, this would get rid of this &#39;girl&#39; nonsense 
once and for all.

	&quot;He challenged my girl form.  You want everyone to know about my 
curse?  This is going to be in a public place, you know,&quot; Ranma said 
for his benefit since he still had not accepted her decision about 
being a girl and not a boy.  &quot;Besides, aren&#39;t you the one always 
telling me to exploit weaknesses?  What if something happens to me and 
I can&#39;t get to hot water, what then?&quot;

	&quot;Well, you can&#39;t help that girls are weaker than boys,&quot; Genma 
started to say, but then saw his son start to tense up.  He tried a 
different tactic.  &quot;You could always retreat.  Let this Mousse win this 
round.  As long as you are still sound in mind and body, you can still 
fight and win another day.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t want to,&quot; Ranma said after giving the idea some thought.  
Besides, the fact that Shampoo would most likely get violent, Ranma 
hated to concede any victory.  She hadn&#39;t done so since she was a 
child.  &quot;I am the heir to the Saotome School of Anything Goes.  I&#39;ll 
win tomorrow.&quot;

	There were times when, Genma was proud of his creation.  *That&#39;s 
more like the son I know, even if he&#39;s a girl at the moment.*  &quot;Well, 
then I guess you&#39;ll need training.  You are not going to win by moping 
all day.&quot;

	Ranma perked up at this.  Her pop, may no longer be the better 
fighter of the two of them, but he was still more experienced than her.  
&quot;What kind of training?&quot;

	&quot;You may be weaker as a girl, but you are also faster.  The 
fastest way to make you take advantage of this fact will be to beat out 
the instinct in you,&quot; Genma said after giving Ranma&#39;s question some 
thought.  He then went over to the doors of the dojo and slid them 
open.  The girls that had been listening in on their conversation piled 
in, falling flat on their faces.  &quot;If you girls have nothing better to 
do, than you can help me train Ranma.  We only have a few hours before 
dawn.&quot;

	&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary.  I will fight him.  Shampoo and Akane 
are not nearly strong enough to beat it out of him,&quot; Cologne said, 
hopping into the dojo on her staff over the sprawling bodies of the 
girls in the doorway.

	Genma pushed the glasses on the bridge of his nose up and closer 
his face.  He noticed the pronoun, the old woman used for Ranma.  *She 
could become a potential ally.*  &quot;Very well, I will instruct Ranma as 
he fights you.&quot;

			* * * * *

	&quot;Again.&quot;

	Ranma struggled to her feet, aware of only his pop&#39;s voice.  The 
wooden rod came at her again.  She desperately sidestepped out of the 
way.  Like the last time, it was getting surprisingly easier as the 
night progressed.  She wasn&#39;t tagged by Cologne until a full minute 
later.

	&quot;You&#39;re not thinking enough.  I&#39;ve told you that not all battles 
should be fought on instinct alone.  Why were you able to dodge that 
first attack now and not before?  Again.&quot;

	Cologne was having a new respect for Saotome Genma.  Who would 
have thought the Anything Goes School could ever produce such a man.  
When she had first entered the house, she had dismissed him, but she 
should have known better.  This man did train the person that had 
beaten the best student she had ever trained.  *A very good 
instructor,* she thought as Ranma again got up to her feet at only the 
sound of his voice.

	Ranma didn&#39;t have much time to think as the Cologne began 
immediately.  *What am I doing right?* she thought frantically.  She 
grabbed the end of the staff as it was swung her way to buy herself 
some time.  Her muscles strained against the old woman.  She suddenly 
noticed something as she held off Cologne quite easily this time.  *My 
base had changed, giving me more strength.  It&#39;s my center of gravity.  
I haven&#39;t gotten used to it yet,* Ranma thought excitedly.

	While it was true that she did adjust her stance while she 
walked, she didn&#39;t apply the same reasoning to her battles.  Her 
trained male mind had been overriding her normal female instincts in 
panic situations.  *It&#39;s also the reason I fall down so much,* Ranma 
thought, remembering all the embarrassing situations she had gotten 
into with Akane and Kodachi when they trained or when she skated on the 
ice.

	Genma smiled as he saw a familiar smirk grace his daughter... 
son&#39;s face.  *He understands.*

	*Maybe she is woman enough after all,* Cologne thought amusedly 
as the battle became more interesting now that Ranma was able to fight 
more effectively.

			* * * * *

	Mousse landed hard to the ground.  *How did Saotome get so good, 
so fast?  The last time we fought, she was slower and one hit would 
knock her down.*

	&quot;Wife win Shampoo back!&quot; Shampoo yelled out with delight and 
immediately glomped onto Ranma following the fight.  &quot;Mousse, now go 
home.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;ll be back.  I will do anything for you, Shampoo,&quot; Mousse said 
from where he lay on the ground.

	A celebratory mood was in the air as Ranma&#39;s fianc&eacute;es and friends 
piled up onto the arena platform to cheer for her.  Ranma&#39;s mind 
however was not in on the celebration.  *Where is he?  I thought he 
would be here?* Ranma thought as she looked around for her pop.  Only 
one person noticed as she silently slipping away from the joyous crowd.

	*We are not finished, yet, Ranma,* Cologne thought to herself.  
*Have you truly forsaken your manhood?  We shall see.*

			* * * * *

	&quot;I was _winning_ that game.  I had Soun on the ropes!&quot; Genma 
grumbled.

	&quot;You could go back, if you want,&quot; Ranma said teasingly.

	&quot;No,&quot; Genma sighed, &quot;we&#39;ve put this trip off too long.  We&#39;ve 
been here for over a month now.  It&#39;s time we got a training trip in.  
Good to see that you&#39;re taking the initiative in your advancement for 
once.&quot;

	&quot;Well, yeah, you know,&quot; Ranma said offhandedly, embarrassed to 
say the real reason she asked for this trip.  She hadn&#39;t known how far 
apart she had grown from the only constant in her life until she had 
stood up there in the ring.  Her pop had always been there watching her 
fights ever since her first one.  It hadn&#39;t felt right to her when she 
didn&#39;t see his familiar face in the crowd.  &quot;I promise, I&#39;ll try to 
stay in male form.  I&#39;ve got some hot water in my thermos already.&quot;

	&quot;You will not.  That&#39;s how you got into this mess in the first 
place.  You will practice in both forms.  That means of course I&#39;ll 
double your training time so your male half doesn&#39;t slack off.&quot;

	&quot;Fath... I mean pop, thank you.&quot;

	&quot;For what?&quot; Genma asked suspiciously, catching Ranma&#39;s slip of 
tongue and almost addressing him politely.  *He&#39;ll never learn,* Genma 
thought, but feeling strangely contented.

	&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; Ranma smiled as the two of them continued on their 
journey.

			* * * * *

	&quot;Shampoo kill Ranma when get back,&quot; Shampoo declared as she sat 
staring moodily at the mud pit.  Now she would have to clean it out 
before it caked on her.  *You better be back in a couple of days, 
Ranma.*

			* * * * *

	&lt;Splash&gt;

	*Why don&#39;t they ever listen?* The Guide wondered as he walked as 
fast as he could to the edge of the pool where yet another hapless 
visitor had fallen.  *Actually, I think this one is different from the 
others.  This man actually jumped in.  But then why was he asking about 
Spring of Drown Girl, if he wanted to jump in to _this_ one.*  &quot;&lt;Are, 
you alright, Mu Si?&gt;&quot; the Guide asked politely to the newly cursed form 
rising from the water.

	&quot;&lt;Mu Si... Mousse?  Never realized how dumb that name was.  I 
rather like Mi Su better.  Call me that from now on!&gt;&quot; Mousse, now 
Misu, proclaimed.

	The Guide blushed as the woman with one motion of her hand threw 
off the white robe she wore after taking off her glasses, revealing 
boxer shorts and a damp tank top underneath.  The spring had apparently 
cured the woman&#39;s normal form&#39;s weak eyesight.  There were not many 
other changes other than hair color, which was now dark red in color.  
*Uh oh*  The Guide took a step back as the woman brought out a whip 
from out of nowhere.  *It can&#39;t be.  Nobody has fallen into this spring 
in hundreds of years.  A spring that that affects both the mind and 
body.*

	&quot;&lt;Now this is much more comfortable,&gt;&quot; Misu said, cracking her 
whip at the same time.  She didn&#39;t know why she bothered with all those 
weapons before when this one was perfect for her.  Well she might keep 
the chains.  *You&#39;ve been a naughty girl, Shampoo.  Time to take your 
punishment,* she thought wickedly before leaving for Nerima.

	The Guide could only watch in horror at what was now unleashed 
into the world.  There were many springs in the Jusenkyo that could 
bring terror like spring that the Pansuto boy was bathed in or the 
Ashura spring, and this was one of them.  He could still remember his 
father&#39;s quivering voice telling him of this story.  *Spring of Drown 
Dominatrix.  Very tragic story of a dominatrix falling into spring one 
thousand and one hundred years ago.*
