<h1>Echoes of a Final Duel (part 8 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/echoduel-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Arisugawa Juri&#39;s orange hair fell in graceful waves
around her face and down over her shoulders, the
simple dress she wore comfortable yet stylish. On
receiving the news earlier that day she had dressed
this way purely on automatic, leaving behind the
business of building her club to attend to this
obligation.

Sitting there in an office listening to the lawyer
read out the will, with her father&#39;s lawyer waiting
nearby Juri had just felt numb, until surprise finally
overwhelmed the shock. &quot;So let me get this straight,&quot;
she said to the lawyer, &quot;my Aunt has left her money to
me?!&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; the young woman nodded from where Rin Kamishiro
sat behind the desk, &quot;and to her long time companion,
Anna, and a trust to artists and writers.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to contest this,&quot; the older man growled
out, swiftly collecting a copy of the will and putting
it into his briefcase. The Arisugasa family lawyer
looked over at Juri and the older woman beside her
with distain as he muttered, &quot;There&#39;s no way she could
have been in her right mind, shutting out her family
in favor of these...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t even think about saying that,&quot; Juri was up like
a shot and in his face, meeting his eyes with a
dangerous gaze.

He stepped back, then simply fled the room in silence.
&quot;Not bad,&quot; Rin nodded, her black hair flowing
gracefully, &quot;I&#39;m just glad you didn&#39;t lay a hand on
him or we&#39;d be all in trouble.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right, Juri?&quot; Anna asked softly.

Falling bonelessly back into her seat Juri looked off
into the distance, her expression oddly pained. &quot;I&#39;ve
been doing pretty well over the past few years, my
modeling and investments have paid off pretty well. I
don&#39;t need this....&quot;

Anna reached over to put her hand on Juri&#39;s, her
Aunt&#39;s long time lover looking at her in sympathy.
&quot;It&#39;s not about need,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;it&#39;s
something Constance wanted to do for you.&quot; A faint,
sad smile, &quot;Besides, there are conditions.&quot;

&quot;Conditions?&quot; Juri blinked.

Rin actually smiled faintly as she picked up a remote
control and turned on a TV, &quot;Yes, your Aunt Constance
left very... explicit instructions.&quot;

Before Juri could say anything a familiar face
appeared on the screen, a woman whose eyes twinkled
kindly with amusement. Constance Arisugawa smiled as
she said, &quot;If you&#39;re seeing this Juri, than I&#39;m
probably dead.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Constance,&quot; Anna sighed, reaching up to wipe at
her eyes.

&quot;Anna has already received a similar tape from me,&quot;
Constance continued with a hint of regret, &quot;but I hope
you&#39;ll support her, Juri.&quot;

&quot;Always,&quot; Juri breathed out sadly.

&quot;You already know about the details of my will,&quot;
Constance smiled, &quot;but I have a few requests of you,
too. We&#39;ve both been hurt by your father&#39;s hypocrisy
over the years, with him trying to deny the existence
of both you his daughter and I his sister, and I&#39;d
like to see if we can help him get his just deserts.&quot;

&quot;Here comes the kicker,&quot; Anna murmured with a faint
smile.

&quot;The trust that I&#39;m setting up will be for the
promotion of gay and lesbian writers and artists,
called the Arisugawa Trust. Any events to promote
these artists will also help keep the family name
prominently tied to the alternative sexualities your
father so despises,&quot; Constance actually smirked,
looking very satisfied with herself.

&quot;Way to go,&quot; Juri smiled faintly.

&quot;The share of my money that will go to you has only
one condition,&quot; Constance said. She hesitated for a
moment, &quot;While you&#39;ve been out to your family for
several years, you haven&#39;t been out in the larger
world.&quot;

&quot;I....&quot; Juri opened her mouth to protest that, then
frowned.

&quot;Of course I believe that will be changing once you
open the club you&#39;ve been so excitedly telling me
about,&quot; Constance continued warmly, &quot;so my request is
only that you remain out of the closet.&quot; A soft sigh,
&quot;I didn&#39;t manage so well at that, something I have
regretted at times, and I hope I can steer you away
from that.&quot; She smiled again warmly and finished, &quot;I
love you, Juri, and hope that you&#39;ll remember me
fondly at times.&quot;

As the tape ended Rin shut the TV off with the remote
then sat back down behind her desk. &quot;While nothing is
explicitly written in the will about some of this,&quot;
she said tactfully, &quot;I think you could easily consider
it a last request.&quot;

&quot;I have every intention of doing that,&quot; Juri said,
wiping at her eyes as she smiled grimly at the young
lawyer. She looked over at Anna, &quot;I didn&#39;t see a
funeral mentioned in the obituary I read, did my
Aunt...?&quot;

&quot;Constance asked to be cremated,&quot; Anna said quietly,
&quot;I and a few of her friends had a place in mind to
scatter her ashes.&quot; A sad smile, &quot;I think you&#39;d be
welcome.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to help,&quot; Juri agreed softly.

Meanwhile, over at the warehouse Tendo Nabiki smiled
in satisfaction at how much work they had accomplished
in only a few months. After ruthlessly gutting much of
the interior an almost entirely new second floor had
been completed, breaking the upper floor into multiple
suites. Earlier, the main floor had been ripped up,
cold cement hauled out even as they rewired the place
for modern electronics and other necessities if they
intended to make it into a nightclub.

The lower floor was going to be mostly one large room,
with some partitions set up to dampen and bounce
sound, and a kitchen and storage area behind the long
bar. After some debate Nabiki had talked Juri into
bringing in karaoke, too, so the workers were
modifying the planned floor layout to add a small
room.

&#39;Yes,&#39; Nabiki though as she pushed black hair up out
of her eyes, &#39;things are going pretty well so far.&#39;
Her cell phone chirped and she pulled it out of her
black jacket, flipping it open in a practiced gesture,
&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Nabiki,&quot; Juri sounded tired, a tone of voice that
Nabiki wasn&#39;t used to hearing from her, &quot;it looks like
I&#39;ll be gone for the rest of the day.&quot;

&quot;How did it go?&quot; Nabiki asked with a gentleness that
might have surprised people who had known her
previously.

&quot;About as well as can be expected,&quot; Juri answered
softly. She brightened a little, &quot;So how are things on
your end?&quot;

&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Nabiki smiled, &quot;the neon company
checked in about the sign, looks like we&#39;ll have it on
schedule. Hitomi is talking to several interior design
companies, getting bids and proposals on decorating
the place, as well as the upstairs suites.&quot;

&quot;Have we heard back about the oak bar I ordered?&quot; Juri
asked crisply, firmly back in business woman mode
again.

&quot;It&#39;ll be done on time,&quot; Nabiki reassured her, &quot;they
already said that they&#39;ve got it half done, including
the interior reinforcement you asked for.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Juri sounded satisfied. &quot;I&#39;ll start contacting
our staff list, then, and get things on that end
ready, too.&quot;

&quot;It looks like we&#39;re going to get this done,&quot; Nabiki
said with satisfaction, &quot;a courier delivered all of
the city permits earlier today.&quot; Curiously she asked
Juri, &quot;So how did you get them pushed through so
quickly?&quot;

&quot;Greased a few palms,&quot; Juri confessed, &quot;sorry to say
it&#39;s the cost of doing business.&quot;

&quot;Which reminds me, we had a few seedy individuals
around the area the last few days,&quot; Nabiki said
briskly, &quot;I suspect that we&#39;re being cased. Do you
want to pay off the local boss for protection?&quot;

&quot;Hell no,&quot; Juri surprised her.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Nabiki raised her eyebrows.

&quot;Trust me,&quot; Juri said with a smile, &quot;I have some
friends coming to work for the bar that would make any
Yakuza wish he had never crossed us.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to meeting them,&quot; Nabiki laughed.

&quot;Once we get a bit closer to opening,&quot; Juri offered,
&quot;I&#39;ve already called them to say they&#39;re hired, but I
want everybody to have a chance to meet, too.&quot;</pre>
