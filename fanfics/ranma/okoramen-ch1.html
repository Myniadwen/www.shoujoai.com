Ranma. I haven&#39;t read many so i don&#39;t know how well
i&#39;ll do with this couple. flames are fire for my
stories so they won&#39;t get me discouraged. Do we update
the same way as submitting.

------------------------------------------------------------

It was a gorgeous fall day in Tokyo in the Nerima
district as the Ukyo opened her restaurant for the
days customers. She was working in the restaurant full
time since she and her friends had graduated the
summer before. She was still feeling a little down
since Ranma and Akane had finally confessed their love
and were married after graduation, but she was happy
for her Ran-Chan and even helped out with the wedding.
But now it was time for her to think about her
business.

After setting up her sign and going back in she was
met by Kunatso and saw her down feeling. &quot;What is
wrong Ukyo-san.&quot; the feminine looking-male ninja
asked. &quot;Nothing, Kunatsu I&#39;m just a little tired.
Thanks for the concern sug.&quot; Kunatsu let it go and
began cleaning the tables and making sure everything
was ready. Little to Ukyos knowledge about a block
away a certain purple haired girl was feeling just
like her.

That morning the Cat Cafe was opening as well but
Shampoo was still fretting over the fact that Ranma
was married to Akane. &quot;Stupid fem boy. Marry pervert
girl over beautiful Shampoo. His fault Shampoo stuck
here in Japan than with Amazons.&quot; Cologne rolled her
eyes at her granddaughters behavior but sympathized
with her. After the wedding Shampoo had to return to
the village and confess her failure in getting Ranma
as her husband. The counsel had decided that Shampoo
was an embarrassment and was forced to give up her
high rank in the village and all her property. With
this ruling Shampoo had to go to Japan as that was the
only home she had. Luckily Pink and Link took her
property and told her she was welcome at all times.

After about an hour the morning crowd really picked up
and both Uchans and the Cat Cafe were filled with to
capacity with people eating and chatting. Both
restaurants were so busy that there was no chance for
Shampoo or Ukyo had no time for a break until almost 2
o&#39;clock and decided to close up for lunch. Little did
they know that Shampoo was heading for Ukyo&#39;s and
vice- versa for food. Hey they cook the stuff all day
I think they&#39;d like something different every now and
then.

As she walked towards the Cat Cafe Ukyo was suddenly
pushed by someone behind her and was thrown forward
and as she embraced her self for the hard concrete her
face landed in a soft mound of flesh. She had no idea
what was going on until she heard Shampoo say &quot;Shampoo
not know Ukyo like her that much.&quot; Ukyo looked up and
saw a smirk of amusement on Shampoos face and felt
herself go beet red.

Shampoo laughed as she saw Ukyos face blush, but
stopped when Ukyo asked &quot;Why are you down this way?&quot;
Shampoo stopped and said &quot;Shampoo bring Ramen for Ukyo
for lunch and hoped Ukyo would make Shampoo miyaki
stuff.&quot; Ukyo nodded and said &quot;Sure hon. Let&#39;s head
back and I&#39;ll make you a special on the house
oknomiyaki.&quot;

Although these two had been enemies in the competition
for Ranma they had become friends after the wedding.
Although they still get defensive over Ranma when they
are around him and end up brawling over his attention
but they are quick to make up and not to break
anything.

When they reached Ukyo&#39;s they were greeted by a bowing
Kunatsu and Shampoo bowed back to him showing off an
excessive amount of cleavage and made a string of
blood leave his nose. Seeing the ninjas face Ukyo told
him to leave and clean the kitchen. &quot;Sorry he&#39;s a bit
shy.&quot; Shampoo just said &quot;That okay. Shows he has
respect for women.&quot; As she said this Ukyo started
flipping the batter and began making a chinese type of
her specialty.

When it was done she flipped it into the air and
caught it with her spatula and slid it onto a plate
and handed it to the amazon who handed her a bowl of
ramen and they sat down and ate the food. As they ate
they began to talk about the day and what they&#39;d do
after closing.

&quot;Well Shampoo wanted to go see new movie but since no
Ranma I don&#39;t see any reason to go.&quot; the amazon said
as she ate the japanese pizza. &quot;Really. I have nothing
to do tonight maybe I&#39;ll go with you.&quot; Ukyo replied
and saw a look of extreme happiness spread across her
face. &quot;Ukyo really want to go with Shampoo?&quot; the
amazon asked through a mouth full of okonomiyaki. Ukyo
nodded and said &quot;Of course. I just need to tell
Konatsu that I&#39;m going out and give him the rest of
the night off.&quot; Shampoo laughed happily and hugged her
friend tightly. &quot;Thank you Ukyo! You make Shampoo very
happy!&quot; Ukyo patted her friends head and breathlessly
said &quot;No problem Shampoo. But would you please let me
go, I need to breathe.&quot;

Shampoo looked up and saw Ukyos face turning purple at
the strength in the hug and let her go and replied
apologetically said &quot;Sorry Ukyo. Not have anything to
do in a long time, and having a friend go really make
me happy.&quot; Ukyo smiled sympathetically and said &quot;It&#39;s
alright. I&#39;ve had about as much to do as you and I
think it is time to take a break.&quot; Shampoo nodded and
said &quot;Well maybe after tonight Ukyo like to go
shopping with Shampoo and help expand wardrobe.&quot;

Ukyo noticed where Shampoo was implying and said &quot;Well
I really should think about being a little more
feminine from now on. Since Ranmas married maybe it&#39;s
time to start looking for other men to attract.&quot; The
two laughed for a minute until Shampoo noticed that it
was time to get ready for the dinner crowd and said
her goodbyes.

After Shampoo left Ukyo got the shop ready for the
crowd as well and was glad that it wasn&#39;t as busy as
it was earlier but it was still a good run. Once
everyone was gone which was at 8, Ukyo decided to
close up early and helped Kunatsu clean and gave him
the rest of the night off, and then left to go and
spend the evening with her friend.</pre>
