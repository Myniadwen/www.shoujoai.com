<h1>Black Rose, Blue Thunder (part 6 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ranma/index.html">Ranma 1/2</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ranma/blakrose-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>	Shampoo considered herself a very calm person in many 
aspects. She was always level headed in battle and this had 
ensured her victory after victory back home in the tribe.

	Yes, Shampoo was a calm person.

	But right now she wasn&#39;t feeling very calm. Not on 
hearing what her Great Grandmother was telling her.

	&quot;&lt;No way!&gt;&quot; Shampoo shouted indignantly. &quot;&lt;I&#39;m not 
wearing this ugly thing! There&#39;s just no way!&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;Xian-pu,&gt;&quot; said Cologne in a surprisingly calm tone 
of voice considering that she was being yelled at. &quot;&lt;If you 
want to stay in Japan then you have to go to school. And when 
you go to school in Japan, you wear a uniform.&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;But this thing is ugly,&gt;&quot; whined Shampoo as she held 
the frumpy green dress for Furinkan High up against her chest. 
&quot;&lt;I&#39;ll look awful with this on. Just awful!&gt;&quot;

	&quot;&lt;No dress, no school, no staying in Japan,&gt;&quot; said 
Cologne while she hopped out of the room on her staff. She 
paused and added, &quot;&lt;And no seeing Tatewaki.&gt;&quot;

	With that, Cologne hopped out of the room to leave 
Shampoo alone and staring at herself the full length mirror 
in contemplation. Suddenly her scarlet eyes gained a very 
strange gleam and she said, &quot;&lt;I have an idea.&gt;&quot;

	Flinging the dress over her shoulder, Shampoo exited 
their hotel room in search of a member of the staff. Cologne 
had said that she had to wear the dress but she hadn&#39;t said 
exactly how she had to wear it.

	Her first step: Finding a pair of scissors.

----------------------------------------------

	&quot;Saotome,&quot; said Tatewaki in grave tones. &quot;Though I&#39;m 
grievous to speak with you, I feel that I must.&quot;

	Pausing in brushing his teeth, Ranma looking at Tatewaki 
and said, &quot;Yeah? What is it, Kuno?&quot;

	Slowly directing his eyes downstairs where a large 
amount of wrapped presents and several thousand bouquets of 
flowers rested, Tatewaki asked, &quot;What is that about?&quot;

	&quot;Oh that,&quot; said Ranma casually. He turned back to the 
sink to spit out the water he&#39;d been swishing in his mouth 
and said, &quot;Those are sympathy gifts for Akane. It&#39;s because 
she flunked her home economics midterm again.&quot;

	&quot;Again?&quot; asked Tatewaki.

	&quot;Yeah, apparently it&#39;s the fifth time for her,&quot; said 
Ranma. &quot;Her cooking has a pretty lethal effect on folks.&quot;

	&quot;Wait,&quot; said Tatewaki as his eyes gained a look of faint 
understanding.  &quot;You said that her name was Akane?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, Akane,&quot; said Ranma who was leaning against the 
door frame and regarding Tatewaki curiously. &quot;She&#39;s the really 
perky one who&#39;s always smiling all the time. So what?&quot;

	&quot;Akane-chan&#39;s volunteer biohazard unit,&quot; said Tatewaki 
to himself while he formed a small smile. Shaking his head 
he walked downstairs and said, &quot;Lethal indeed.&quot;

	Watching Tatewaki walk down the stairs, Ranma shrugged 
and said, &quot;Whatever. I gotta get dressed.&quot;

	&quot;Why do that when you look so very handsome in what 
you&#39;re wearing right now?&quot; asked Kodachi.

	She was hanging halfway out of Akane&#39;s bedroom where 
she was currently staying since Nabiki had kicked her out of 
her room after she and Kodachi had what was being called a 
slight mishap when it came to choices in lingerie.

	Or was it choices in lack of lingerie?

	Whatever it was, Nabiki had yelled about it and Kodachi 
had ended up kicked out of her room. Not that it bothered 
Kodachi all that much. Akane was a vastly better roommate as 
she didn&#39;t seem to mind much of anything.

	That was the kind of roommate Kodachi appreciated. 
Especially since she had so many charming quirks.

	&quot;Nice idea, Dachi,&quot; said Ranma with a smirk. &quot;But I 
think that if I showed up at school in just my boxer shorts 
it&#39;d make the teachers sorta angry. But maybe if you did it...&quot;

	&quot;Do what?&quot; Kodachi purred as she moved closer to wrap 
her arms around his neck. &quot;Show up wearing my little silk 
negligee or show up wearing your boxer shorts?&quot;

	&quot;Heh,&quot; Ranma chuckled before moving his lips closer to 
Kodachi&#39;s. &quot;You&#39;d look beautiful in either.&quot;

	The couple were still in the middle of their involved 
kiss when Ryoga wandered out of the hall closet which he&#39;d 
thought was the furo only to freeze on seeing them.

	Nearing the couple, Ryoga grumbled, &quot;Don&#39;t they ever 
quit?&quot; Stopping in front of them he tapped Ranma on the 
shoulder and said, &quot;Move it or lose it. I wanna take a bath 
before we leave for school.&quot;

	&quot;Why?&quot; Ranma smirked as he and Kodachi moved out of 
Ryoga&#39;s way like his brother requested. &quot;You need to fix 
yourself up for your brand new iinazuke? I&#39;m sure Nabchan will 
appreciate your efforts, big bro.&quot;

	&quot;You shut up,&quot; growled Ryoga. He stomped past Ranma and 
closed the door to the furo with a loud slam as he said, &quot;Know 
that I still haven&#39;t forgiven you for tricking me!&quot;

	&quot;Blockhead,&quot; said Ranma under his breath. Turning back to 
Kodachi he smiled and said, &quot;Ryoga always had too good a memory 
if you ask me. He remembers everything.&quot;

	&quot;Eidetic?&quot; asked Kodachi curiously.

	&quot;Nah,&quot; replied Ranma as his smile widened. Slinging an 
arm over her shoulder he said, &quot;Selective. He&#39;s like Pop in 
that way. Only remembers what he wants to.&quot;

	&quot;While you,&quot; Kodachi said sensuously. &quot;Remember everything 
perfectly but claim otherwise, am I correct?&quot;

	Pausing in front of Akane&#39;s room, Ranma quirked an 
eyebrow and said, &quot;Isn&#39;t that how it should be, Dachi?&quot;

	Moving in for yet another kiss, Kodachi murmured against 
Ranma&#39;s lips, &quot;Quite.&quot;

-------------------------------------------------

	Akane didn&#39;t feel quite herself.

	She felt less than perky.

	In other words, Akane just wasn&#39;t reaching her optimum 
perky potential.

	Sure the ten thousand bouquets of red roses she&#39;d 
received were lovely but she really wanted to pass her home 
economics midterm this year. She&#39;d worked so hard, studied 
for hours, and still she had flunked.

	Was she doomed to a non cooking existence?

	No! She refused to accept that possibility. She was 
Tendo Akane, the consecutive MVP for each of her sports teams 
since she&#39;d joined them, and she would triumph!

	 A wide smile graced her pretty features and a familiar 
twinkle formed in her eyes which signaled her return.

	The return of perky Akane.

	And she would continue to bravely cook on.

	Somehow, all the citizens of Nerima knew of this decision 
and found a chill running down their spines at it.

	Beware to the hungry, for Akane cooks on.

------------------------------------------------

	Furinkan High was in shock.

	Or at least some of its students were.

	They were all staring at the curvaceous lavender haired 
girl who stood at the front entrance to the school. The girl 
was dressed in what used to be the girls uniform for their 
high school but now looked like something entirely different.

	It looked a bit like something that a stripper would wear. 
A stripper or some type of anime superhero. Either way, it 
definitely didn&#39;t look like the Furinkan girls school uniform.

	Especially not with the fact that the skirt was only 
millimeters above the girl&#39;s panty line. And who could ignore 
the low collar that revealed the girl&#39;s very ample breasts?

	But what was most shocking was the fact that not all of 
the boys were looking at the lavender haired girl. Quite a few 
of them were, more than a hundred or so, but not all of them. 
For some reason there was a group of around fifty boys standing 
in the far corner of the yard who didn&#39;t appear at all 
interested in the lavender haired girl or looking at her 
cleavage.

	The students figured those boys had to be sick.

	They were probably the few poor saps who had inadvertently 
ran into Akane over the weekend and her food had warped their 
sex drives or something like that.

	Because why else would they ignore the new girl?

------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Well? Did you see her or not, Maseo?&quot;

	Chushin Maseo formed a wide smile and folded his 
arms across his chest. &quot;I saw her,&quot; he said in slow triumph.

	Immediately all the boys crowded closer.

	&quot;You did?!&quot;

	&quot;What did you say?!&quot;

	&quot;Did she like our presents?!&quot;

	&quot;Was she still not wearing a bra?!&quot;

	&quot;Did her boobs bounce up and down again?!&quot;

	Holding his hands up the air in a gesture for silence 
Maseo looked calmly at all his followers. He paused to clear 
his throat then said, &quot;She liked our presents and she seemed 
very grateful for our attention.&quot;

	All the boys oohed and ahhed at this information before 
they moved onto other questions.

	&quot;What&#39;s her name?!&quot;

	&quot;Where&#39;s she from?!&quot;

	&quot;How old is she?!&quot;

	&quot;Is she still a virgin?!&quot;	

	&quot;What&#39;s her cup size?!&quot;

	Smirking at the last question, Maseo ran his hand through 
his thick head of blonde hair and formed what the girls liked to 
call his &#39;heart breaker&#39; smile.

	&quot;Her name,&quot; Maseo began dramatically and all the boys 
leaned closer in anticipation. &quot;Is Chocolate and she&#39;s from 
China. She&#39;s sixteen, like us, and from the way acted very shy 
around me I&#39;d say she&#39;s still a virgin.&quot; He paused to look at 
the last boy who&#39;d asked a question and said, &quot;I&#39;d guess that&#39;s 
she&#39;s a double d at the least.&quot;

	All the boys oohed and ahhed again before they began 
discussing their latest obsession. The new girl they&#39;d met on 
their day off from school. The one who rivaled Akane when it 
came to being kawaii and had the looks of an idol singer.

	&quot;Chocolate! How sweet!&quot;

	&quot;I wanna take a bite out of her candy bar!&quot;

	&quot;Drink her syrup!&quot;

	&quot;And have some of her Hershey&#39;s kisses!&quot;

	&quot;Chocolate&#39;s the tastiest girl ever!&quot;

	Nodding his head in solemn agreement, Maseo folded his 
arms across his chest and said, &quot;That&#39;s all she told me before 
I left. Apparently she&#39;s sort of shy and I&#39;m not even sure if 
she goes to high school.&quot; He paused and looked sad as he said, 
&quot;I don&#39;t even think her parents are here with her. It looks 
like she&#39;s traveling alone.&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;s alone?!&quot;

	&quot;We should protect her!&quot;

	&quot;Yes, protect her!&quot;

	&quot;Some pervert might molest our sweet Chocolate!&quot;

	&quot;Or try to lick her!&quot;

	At this last statement everyone looked at Hayami Ichiro 
who shrugged sheepishly at the attention and said, &quot;It could 
happen.&quot;

	There was another pause before the boys all nodded their 
solemn agreement. They now had their mission.

	&quot;We must protect Chocolate!&quot;

-----------------------------------------------

	Shampoo looked over at the crowd of boys standing in the 
far corner of the yard and blinked. Apparently Japanese boys 
had some sort of obsession with their candy and keeping others 
from eating it. She was wondering if Tatewaki shared that 
obsession when suddenly she looked forward to see him approaching 
with the demon thieves and other companions.

	&quot;Tachi!&quot; called Shampoo as she waved, recalling the 
nickname Ryoga often called him which sounded very cute to her. 
Jogging up the group, Shampoo smiled brightly and said, &quot;Is big 
surprise, Shampoo go to school with you!&quot;

	The entire group stared at Shampoo for a long moment and 
the Amazon noted their reactions in confusion.

	Ranma and Kodachi were looking at her in what appeared 
to be mixed humor and lust.

	Ryoga had his eyes covered.

	Akane didn&#39;t seem to notice anything and gave her usual 
perky smile as she beamed at Shampoo.

	Nabiki wore a droll expression.

	And Tatewaki?

	Well, Tatewaki was in shock. He simply stared at Shampoo 
with a blank expression on his handsome features.

	Observing this for a moment, Shampoo frowned then produced 
her bonbori to lightly hit Tatewaki on the head with it. Seconds 
later, Tatewaki blinked then looked at Shampoo before he hastily 
averted his eyes to look at the sky.

	&quot;Shampoo,&quot; began Tatewaki nervously. &quot;I&#39;m most pleased to 
see you but may I ask what have you done to the girls uniform 
for this learning institution?&quot;

	&quot;Shampoo altered it,&quot; said Shampoo with a shrug. &quot;Before 
dress was all ugly and frumpy but make a few cuts and snips now 
Shampoo can maneuver easily in it. Does Tachi like how Shampoo 
looks in new style dress?&quot;

	&quot;I think you look marvelous,&quot; Kodachi said in a playful 
purr. She leaned on Ranma&#39;s shoulder and looked up into his 
eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t you agree, Ranma darling?&quot;

	&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Ranma said in charming tones. &quot;She looks very 
marvelous. The most marvelous I&#39;ve ever seen her.&quot;

	Frowning at this, Shampoo sniffed then said, &quot;Not asking 
for your thoughts. Shampoo only interested in what Tachi thinks 
about new style dress. And maybe friend Ryoga too.&quot; She tilted 
her head to look at Ryoga who still had his eyes covered and 
asked, &quot;Why cover eyes, Ryoga?&quot;

	&quot;I... uhm... it&#39;s... errr...&quot; Ryoga stammered.

	&quot;He&#39;s got issues with dress alterations,&quot; cut in Nabiki 
smoothly. For some reason she felt the need to save her very 
nervous iinazuke from any further embarrassment. &quot;Don&#39;t you, 
Ryoga-kun? Fashion just bothers you, right?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah!&quot; said Ryoga quickly. He kept his hands over his 
eyes and turned towards the sound of Nabiki&#39;s voice. &quot;I&#39;m a 
fashion purist. All snotty in that way.&quot;

	After Ryoga said this, he started laughing anxiously. 
As she rolled her eyes, Nabiki touched the small of his back 
and said, &quot;C&#39;mon fashion purist. Lets get you to class.&quot;

	Everyone watched their departure before Akane clapped 
her hands and said, &quot;Yay! Oneechan likes him!&quot;

	Simultaneously everyone looked to Akane, but Kodachi 
was the one to speak as she asked, &quot;Why would you say that 
Akane-chan? She&#39;s merely helping him to class.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Akane in very cute exasperation. &quot;But 
Oneechan never helps anyone to class. Much less a boy. So 
if she&#39;s helping Ryoga that means she must like him.&quot; There 
was a pause before she exclaimed, &quot;They&#39;re like real iinazukes!&quot;

	&quot;Well, she is being most friendly with Ryoga-kun,&quot; said 
Tatewaki slowly. &quot;That&#39;s a pleasant start.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s a great start,&quot; said Akane with a wide grin.

	&quot;Tachi,&quot; said Shampoo in confusion. &quot;What is iinazukes?&quot;

	At this question, Tatewaki turned beet red and tugged 
at his collar before he said, &quot;It&#39;s... errr... well...&quot;

	&quot;They&#39;re engaged,&quot; said Kodachi smoothly. &quot;Just as Ranma 
dearest and I would be if our families had made such an arrangement. 
Ryoga and Nabiki are involved in what hopes to be a relationship 
that leads to marriage. Or at least it will be if she no longer 
wishes to become a spinster.&quot;

	&quot;Spinster?&quot; Shampoo blinked.

	&quot;An old lady who never gets married and leads a miserable 
life,&quot; Ranma supplied as he smirked.

	&quot;Oh,&quot; said Shampoo wisely. &quot;You is meaning like Great 
Grandmother. Shampoo see how one called Nabiki be taking after 
her. Except she is yelling much louder.&quot;

	Shampoo was about to say something more but the bell 
sounded and Akane got a panicked look on her features as she 
exclaimed, &quot;We&#39;re going to be late!&quot;

	With that, Akane sped forward to leave them all in a huge 
cloud of dust. Waving it away from her face, Shampoo looked to 
Tatewaki and formed a slow smile.

	&quot;Tachi,&quot; said Shampoo as she hooked her arm in his. &quot;You 
is maybe showing Shampoo to class, like what Nabiki is doing for 
friend Ryoga? What you think about that?&quot;

	&quot;Uhm... well, certainly,&quot; Tatewaki replied in slightly 
nervous tones. &quot;Whatever you like, Shampoo.&quot;

	Her smile widening, Shampoo leaned slightly into 
Tatewaki as she said, &quot;Shampoo just liking this... for now.&quot;

	Watching this departure, Ranma quirked an eyebrow and 
said, &quot;Ain&#39;t she the fast mover?&quot;

	&quot;Mmm,&quot; murmured Kodachi as she observed her brother and 
Shampoo with careful eyes. &quot;That she is. I think that perhaps 
we should be keeping a close eye on my dearest brother and 
this Shampoo character. It&#39;s more than obvious that she has 
designs on him. Perhaps we can use to this our advantage in our 
dealings with her Great Grandmother.&quot;

	&quot;Dachi,&quot; said Ranma in a low sexy drawl. &quot;You are a genius. 
You do know that, right?&quot;

	&quot;Of course,&quot; Kodachi purred as she favored him with a 
catlike smile. &quot;You&#39;re always telling me so.&quot;

	Chuckling softly, Ranma held Kodachi&#39;s hand in his own 
and said, &quot;Hey. A guy&#39;s gotta do what a guy&#39;s gotta do.&quot;

	&quot;So very true,&quot; said Kodachi with a smile.

-------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Ready, Tendo?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, Saotome. And you?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; said Genma in grave tones. &quot;Lets go. We 
must insure the future of the Anything Goes school.&quot;

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Soun with a solemn nod. &quot;We must.&quot;

	With that, the two men dashed out of Tendo dojo and 
towards Furinkan High with who knows what in mind.

	Watching them disappear, Kasumi shook her head and 
murmured, &quot;Poor Imotochan. I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m not her.&quot;

	Kasumi then turned to head back into the kitchen as 
she contemplated her plans for the day.

	One might say that was a very odd statement on Kasumi&#39;s 
part but can you really blame her for making it?

------------------------------------------------

	&quot;So class,&quot; began the Sensei in bored tones. &quot;We have 
yet another new student. This is Kuno Tatewaki and what a 
surprise, he&#39;s just gotten back from a journey in China.&quot; 
The Sensei turned to Tatewaki and said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you tell 
us a little about yourself, Kuno-san?&quot;

	&quot;Of course,&quot; said Tatewaki in hesitant tones due to 
the underlining sarcasm in the teacher&#39;s voice. He cleared his 
throat then said, &quot;It&#39;s true I have just returned from China. 
I was traveling there with my good friend, Hibiki Ryoga, whom 
is also attending this school. My passions are studying the 
martial arts, in particular Kendo and fencing, and protecting 
my younger sister Kodachi from whatever villainies arise in 
this world.&quot;

	When he finished this speech, Tatewaki looked to the 
Sensei who wore a droll look on his features. &quot;An excellent 
summary of your life, Kuno-san,&quot; said the Sensei. &quot;Now why 
don&#39;t you take the empty seat by Tendo-san there?&quot;

	Giving a short nod, Tatewaki smoothly crossed the room 
to sit next to Nabiki who favored him with an amused smile 
before she said quietly, &quot;Nice move lover boy. You do know 
that you&#39;ve just gained yourself a fan club, right?&quot;

	&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Tatewaki quietly.

	&quot;Check it out,&quot; whispered Nabiki as she gave a subtle 
jerk of her head to the side.

	Following Nabiki&#39;s gesture, Tatewaki turned to look into 
twenty or so pairs of adoring eyes. His gaze going wide at 
this, Tatewaki looked at Nabiki and asked, &quot;What is the meaning 
of this? All I did was introduce myself.&quot;

	&quot;When it comes to this school,&quot; Nabiki began with a 
chuckle. &quot;That&#39;s all it really takes.&quot;

	His eyes going even wider, Tatewaki swallowed the lump 
in his throat as he looked back at the girls who seemed intent 
on studying his every feature.

	It was only his first day and already Tatewaki felt 
like he was already in trouble.

	In very deep trouble at that because all the girls of 
Furinkan High were horribly deprived.

	Deprived of intelligent, polite, and good looking boys. 
When Ranma came they got their first taste of being around a 
boy like that and now the girls craved more.

	That&#39;s when Tatewaki arrived.

	And unlike Ranma, he was very much single.

	This meant one thing to the girls of Furinkan High.

	The hunt was on and Tatewaki was the prey.

	Oh yes, he was very much in trouble.

---

	&quot;Chocolate? Why did I say that of all things?&quot;

	The girl once known as Mousse but now known as Chocolate 
cursed her own stupid lack of ideas. When the boy had asked 
her name she started to say her real name but then remembered 
she was here on a secret mission. She mustn&#39;t let Shampoo know 
of her presence, so that meant she shouldn&#39;t give out her real 
name. And looking around her hotel room that was overflowing 
with gifts her eyes had locked on the huge pile of chocolate 
she&#39;d received.

	The reaction was immediate and she ended up telling 
him that her name was Chocolate.

	Which meant that her name was now Chocolate Mousse.

	Chocolate groaned at this. Could she possibly have 
picked out a lamer name for herself? Highly doubtful.

	Oh well, she was stuck with it now. She was now Chocolate 
Mousse or just plain Chocolate for short.

	Shaking her head again, Chocolate bounded onto the 
skylight to the large gym and watched as Shampoo competed in 
gym class. The girls were playing a game she thought was called 
basketball but really it was more like Shampoo versus a petite 
girl with short black hair. This was because all of the other 
girls were standing on the sidelines watching Shampoo and the 
other girl battle each other.

	Suddenly, a whistle sounded and all the girls got off 
the court. Narrowing her eyes, Chocolate followed their 
departure with her eyes as it led towards a nearby building. 
And just as she started to go after them, Chocolate found the 
glass cracking under her slight weight and she went falling 
from the skylight and towards the ground.

	Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your opinion, 
she landed on a very surprised Hayami Ichiro.

	&quot;Y-You!&quot; Ichiro stammered as his eyes went wide. &quot;It&#39;s 
really you! But where did you come from?&quot;

	Blinking away her dazed feeling, Chocolate looked at 
the boy she was sitting on and frowned. &quot;Huh?&quot; she asked as 
she looked at him. &quot;What happened?&quot;

	&quot;You fell!&quot; one of the boys offered eagerly.

	Seconds after he said this the others chimed in.

	&quot;Are you okay?!&quot;

	&quot;You didn&#39;t hurt yourself did you?!&quot;

	&quot;Want me to give you a physical?!&quot;

	&quot;Ah! Marry me, Chocolate!&quot;

	Standing up slowly, Chocolate looked at all the boys with 
wide eyes before she found herself surrounded again.

	She was starting to find this annoying.

------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Honestly,&quot; said Nabiki with a sigh. &quot;How could you 
think that the storage closet was your classroom?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ryoga said sheepishly. He rubbed the back 
of his head and looked apologetic. &quot;It&#39;s just that I can&#39;t 
really see the difference in things when I get lost.&quot;

	&quot;You have no sense of direction at all?&quot; asked Nabiki 
curiously as she led him towards his class.

	&quot;Not really,&quot; admitted Ryoga. &quot;According to Ranma when 
people tell me to go right I usually go left. I always get 
turned around about anything involving directions.&quot;

	&quot;So if I give you directions and you should go right 
and tell you that you should go left, you&#39;ll end up where 
you ought to be?&quot; Nabiki pondered thoughtfully.

	&quot;Hey,&quot; said Ryoga as he formed a slow smile. &quot;That&#39;s 
not a bad idea, Nabiki.&quot; His smile went brighter as he said 
in happy tones, &quot;Wait until I tell Dad! This is great!&quot;

	Nabiki was about to respond when Ryoga suddenly moved 
in front of her in a guarded movement. Surprised at his 
actions, she started to ask him what was wrong when a net 
fell from the ceiling and she found herself trapped.

	Struggling against the net, Nabiki could vaguely see 
Ryoga desperately fighting to free them both.

	That was when the darkness engulfed them.

------------------------------------------------

	Hefting Ryoga over his shoulder, Genma looked to Soun 
as they bounded away from the grounds of Furinkan High. &quot;This 
is going to work, Tendo,&quot; he said.

	&quot;Yes, Saotome,&quot; agreed Soun. &quot;Once we put them on their 
very first date they&#39;re sure to fall in love.&quot;

	&quot;So very true,&quot; said Genma with a smile.

	After a moment, Soun looked at Genma and asked, &quot;But why 
did we have to surprise them at school like this?&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s simple, Tendo,&quot; said Genma solemnly. &quot;Do you really 
think that they&#39;re going to ask each other out?&quot;

	&quot;Good point,&quot; said Soun wryly.

	&quot;Besides,&quot; said Genma. &quot;They&#39;re only missing their last 
class and we&#39;ve already signed them both out.&quot;

	&quot;Right again, Saotome,&quot; said Soun. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for ever 
doubting you. This is indeed an excellent plan.&quot;

	With that, the two men continued on their trek towards 
the chosen date spot for their two offspring.

	The world famous Karaoke Palace.

-------------------------------------------------

	Cologne had to stop herself from laughing. It had been 
a very long time since she felt the urge to do so but it was 
a natural instinct considering her current situation.

	Watching Perfume follow Kasumi&#39;s every instruction and 
whim like a henpecked Airen was truly priceless.

	She observed as Perfume held the large stack of laundry 
Kasumi was piling in her arms with a wary expression and almost 
laughed but held it back. Instead, Cologne gave a short cough 
and asked, &quot;Where is your father, Tendo-san?&quot;

	&quot;He&#39;s with Ojisama Saotome,&quot; Kasumi murmured as she 
stacked another blanket in Perfume&#39;s pile. &quot;They&#39;re off trying 
to arrange some sort of date for Imotochan.&quot;

	&quot;A date?&quot; asked Cologne.

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Kasumi. &quot;They altered the engagement. Now 
it&#39;s Ryoga and not Ranma who will be marrying into the family 
to uphold the agreement. Yesterday he chose Nabiki as his iinazuke. 
Although,&quot; Kasumi flushed slightly. &quot;Akane and I didn&#39;t give him 
much of a choice. I told him about my obligations to Perfume and 
Akane has ways of making boys do what she wants. That left Nabiki.&quot;

	&quot;Your middle sister,&quot; Cologne murmured. &quot;The one who seems 
opposed to your union with my Perfume.&quot;

	&quot;Angry sister,&quot; Perfume supplied with a snort. &quot;Is girl 
who is yelling all time and is too uptight for own good.&quot;

	&quot;Perfume,&quot; chided Kasumi. &quot;Imotochan isn&#39;t that bad.&quot;

	&quot;She yell too much,&quot; Perfume grumbled. &quot;Hurt my ears. 
Maybe she try lower volume sometime.&quot;

	&quot;So they&#39;re out arranging a date for her and Ryoga? They 
really do seem focused on this engagement,&quot; Cologne noted. 
&quot;Then again,&quot; she said. &quot;I can hardly blame them for wanting 
to safeguard their future. It is something that I want to do 
myself with my own Granddaughters.&quot;

	&quot;Yes,&quot; said Kasumi with a smile. She placed the last 
blanket in Perfume&#39;s pile which now reached far above the 
Amazon&#39;s head. &quot;But your methods are far more subtle. I just 
don&#39;t think that my father&#39;s tactics will work too well.&quot;

	&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Cologne. &quot;And why not?&quot;

	&quot;Because,&quot; said Kasumi as she gently led Perfume out 
of the laundry room. &quot;Imotochan simply hates surprises.&quot;

	Hearing this, Cologne froze in the doorway and blinked 
before she repeated to herself, &quot;Surprises?&quot;

-----------------------------------------------

	&quot;Where&#39;s Nabiki darling?&quot; asked Kodachi.

	&quot;Dunno,&quot; said Ranma. &quot;Maybe she&#39;s with Ryoga?&quot;

	The two were standing in front of Furinkan High waiting 
for the others to join them as classes were over for the day. 
Tatewaki and Shampoo were with them as Akane was busy with 
soccer practice for the rest of the day.

	&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if their romance did truly 
succeed?&quot; Kodachi asked as she leaned on Ranma&#39;s arm.

	&quot;Sure would,&quot; Ranma replied. &quot;My big bro could use a 
girl like Nabiki to get him over his problem with women.&quot;

	&quot;What problem?&quot; asked Shampoo curiously.

	At this question, Ranma&#39;s eyes widened and chuckling 
he said, &quot;You gotta be kidding. No way you didn&#39;t notice.&quot;

	&quot;Notice what?&quot; asked Shampoo with increasing impatience 
as she frowned at Ranma.

	&quot;Ryoga-kun has a problem with being extremely shy in 
the presence of feminine beauty,&quot; Tatewaki offered. &quot;It&#39;s a 
condition that he cannot control and it&#39;s quite...&quot;

	&quot;Embarrassing,&quot; Ranma supplied. &quot;The blockhead stammers 
anytime a girl talks to him. And if he gets even a hint of 
seeing naked female flesh, fainting is a definite.&quot;

	Pondering this, Shampoo finally said, &quot;But Ryoga is nice 
boy and Perfume Cousin say that Nabiki is too angry for own 
good. She lucky to have him.&quot;

	&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Kodachi with a smile. &quot;That&#39;s what we 
think about the situation, my dear Shampoo.&quot;

	&quot;Hmph,&quot; Shampoo sniffed. She looked to Tatewaki and 
smiled as she said, &quot;Is nice they alone. That best way to 
get to know person you is liking. Don&#39;t you think, Tachi?&quot;

	Flushing at the coy look Shampoo was giving him, Tatewaki 
tugged on the collar to his shirt and said, &quot;Yes. I&#39;d have to 
agree with your sentiments. But I&#39;m afraid it just isn&#39;t like 
Ryoga-kun to be so comfortable with a female this quickly. I 
find the idea a bit dubious.&quot;

	&quot;I hate to say it but Kuno&#39;s right,&quot; Ranma murmured. &quot;I 
hope that blockhead didn&#39;t get himself and Nabiki lost.&quot;

	&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Kodachi playfully. &quot;That might 
be just the thing to light their romantic flame.&quot;

	Before anyone could say anything else, a blurred figure 
dashed past them and off campus with a large crowd of boys 
chasing after it shouting at the top of their lungs.

	&quot;Come back, Chocolate!&quot;

	&quot;We just want to taste you!&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s not our fault you&#39;re so sweet!&quot;

	&quot;Give me cavities with your love!&quot;

	&quot;Chocolate, I want your kisses!&quot;

	The group watched the crowd of boys depart and were 
silent for a long while before a very puzzled Shampoo finally 
asked, &quot;Why you Japanese like candy so much?&quot;

	For a response, the others simply blinked.

------------------------------------------------

	Ryoga and Nabiki weren&#39;t happy.

	First of all, they had been ambushed at school.

	Second of all, they had been ambushed by their meddling 
fathers for the sake of their new &#39;engagement&#39;.

	Third of all, they had been ambushed and brought to a 
place that both of them utterly despised.

	&quot;Of all the places they had to dump us at,&quot; Nabiki groused. 
&quot;It had to be a Karaoke bar.&quot;

	&quot;I know,&quot; Ryoga agreed with a grumble. &quot;I hate these 
places. They&#39;re just so embarrassing and no one who comes to 
them can even sing all that well.&quot;

	&quot;I hate being in the spotlight,&quot; said Nabiki. &quot;The only 
sort of attention I want is from martial arts or schoolwork.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ryoga. &quot;I can understand that. I&#39;d have no 
problem if we were at a martial arts tournament.&quot;

	&quot;Same here,&quot; said Nabiki with a sigh. She looked at the 
current performer who was singing fairly decently. &quot;But this 
place? No way. There&#39;s just no way I&#39;d do this.&quot;

	&quot;You won&#39;t have to,&quot; said Ryoga quietly. &quot;I promise.&quot;

	Slowly their eyes met and they both smiled. That was 
when the performer finished her song and the loud voice of the 
DJ echoed in the bar as he said, &quot;Next up are a pair of very 
special lovebirds! Hibiki Ryoga and Tendo Nabiki!&quot;

	&quot;Nani?&quot; squeaked Ryoga and Nabiki together.

	&quot;Aw, look at them folks!&quot; DJ Kamikaze Kenjiko roared 
while the hot spotlight landed on Ryoga and Nabiki. &quot;Aren&#39;t 
they just the cutest couple? Get on stage you two!&quot;

	&quot;Nani?&quot; repeated Ryoga and Nabiki.

	&quot;And they&#39;re shy to boot! Isn&#39;t that charming?&quot; DJ 
Kamikaze Kenjiko said. &quot;Why don&#39;t some of you regulars help 
them up to the stage so they can sing for us!&quot;

	Suddenly Ryoga and Nabiki found themselves propelled 
through the crowd and shoved on stage. Their eyes wide and 
their bodies frozen they stared at the audience.

	It wasn&#39;t all that entertaining to watch.

	After a long moment passed, one of the bar patrons shouted 
out, &quot;Sing already! We&#39;re getting bored here!&quot;

	Snapping out of her momentary daze, Nabiki scowled and 
said, &quot;We&#39;re not singing! We don&#39;t want to!&quot; She whirled around 
to face DJ Kamikaze Kenjiko and said, &quot;Who are you to force us 
on stage anyway? I bet this is a set up!&quot;

	&quot;Set up?&quot; DJ Kamikaze Kenjiko&#39;s somewhat nervous voice 
echoed in the bar. &quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding. This is a bar 
and not some sort of government conspiracy.&quot; As he said this, 
the DJ stuffed the bribe money that the two old guys had given 
him earlier further into the pocket of his pants. &quot;Would you both 
just sing already?&quot;

	&quot;No,&quot; replied Nabiki stubbornly. She folded her arms across 
her chest and said, &quot;We don&#39;t want to.&quot;

	At this point the bar patrons were getting irate.

	&quot;This sucks!&quot;

	&quot;What sort of act is this?!

	&quot;Sing Moonlight Densetsu!&quot;

	&quot;No! Sing Night Flower!&quot;

	&quot;Take off your shirt!&quot;

	Nabiki scowled even deeper at the last comment while Ryoga 
turned beet red and shouted, &quot;You&#39;re all freaks!&quot;

	This comment caused a near riot.

	And observing all of this from his extremely safe booth, 
DJ Kamikaze Kenjiko decided to use what the two old guys called 
the great equalizer when it came to these kids.

	He would insult them.

	&quot;I bet you can&#39;t sing,&quot; DJ Kamikaze Kenjiko said in mocking 
tones. &quot;I bet you&#39;re both horrible singers and that&#39;s why you 
don&#39;t want to perform! You both really suck!&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, you suck!&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re bad singers!&quot;

	&quot;Sing the Sunlit Garden!&quot;

	&quot;Stupid, that&#39;s instrumental!&quot;

	&quot;Play it then!&quot;

	&quot;Yup,&quot; continued DJ Kamikaze Kenjiko who now sounded 
extremely sad. &quot;I bet you&#39;re both horrible singers. I bet that 
anyone here can sing twice as good as you two.&quot;

	Right about now Ryoga and Nabiki were getting upset. Their 
faces were an identical shade of red but it was Nabiki who 
reacted first as she stomped forward to grab the microphone from 
its stand.

	&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; Nabiki&#39;s voice echoed in the bar. &quot;No one 
insults Tendo Nabiki! You want a song? You&#39;ll get a song!&quot;

	Seconds later, Nabiki broke out into an enthusiastic and 
notably excellent performance of Material Girl.

	It just so happened that Nabiki&#39;s second most secret vice 
was a never ending passion for Madonna and her music.

	Who would&#39;ve guessed?

-----------------------------------------------

	In a haze of disbelief, Genma and Soun watched as the scene 
in front of them unfolded.

	They hadn&#39;t expected Ryoga and Nabiki to stay in the Karaoke 
bar. In fact, they were fully prepared to battle the pair to keep 
them inside of the establishment and on their date.

	And they certainly hadn&#39;t expected them both to end up on 
stage despite the fact that they had bribed the DJ.

	But what they really hadn&#39;t expected was for Ryoga and 
Nabiki to turn out to be utterly fantastic singers.

	Right now, Ryoga was finishing his own very rough but sexy 
version of Wherever I May Roam by Metallica and as he did so 
several the female audience members swooned at the sound of his 
low voice echoing throughout the room.

	Among his admirers was Nabiki and when Ryoga finished the 
number she gave him a quick hug which, much to Genma&#39;s amazement, 
didn&#39;t cause Ryoga to pass out.

	Watching as the teenagers moved into a duet of Manic Monday, 
both Genma and Soun tried to regain their wits. Soun finally 
looked at Genma and bursting into a flood of happy tears, he 
exclaimed, &quot;We&#39;ve done it!&quot;

	&quot;Yes, Tendo!&quot; Genma echoed as he clutched the other man&#39;s 
shoulders. &quot;They&#39;re the perfect couple!&quot;

	&quot;The Anything Goes school is insured!&quot; Soun cried.

	As they continued to cry over the formation of the perfect 
couple and the insured future of the Anything Goes school, Ryoga 
and Nabiki launched into their next song. All the while finding 
themselves becoming more and more fond of Karaoke bars and their 
patrons.

------------------------------------------------

	&quot;This is the place?&quot; asked Ranma skeptically.

	He and Kodachi were standing in front of what looked to be 
an abandoned building in downtown Nerima. According to the 
directions that Cologne had given Kodachi it was indeed the 
chosen meeting place, but the building hardly looked like somewhere 
Cologne would want to be.

	&quot;That&#39;s what the address says, dearest,&quot; Kodachi murmured 
as she studied the small piece of paper.

	&quot;Huh,&quot; Ranma said thoughtfully. After a moment, he shrugged 
and said, &quot;I guess we better just go inside.&quot;

	With that, Ranma moved forward to open the door to the 
building and seconds later was soaked from head to toe as a 
bucket of cold water fell from the door and onto his head.

	Pushing a now blonde strand of hair out of her eyes, Ranma 
looked sourly at Cologne who was standing in front of them wearing 
a smug expression.

	&quot;What did you do that for?!&quot; demanded Ranma.

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Kodachi added as she took a step forward to stand 
at Ranma&#39;s side. &quot;It was entirely unnecessary.&quot;

	Not answering them, Cologne merely produced a glowing red 
amulet from out of nowhere and held it up in the air for them to 
see. Giving the couple a close inspection, she asked rather 
solemnly, &quot;What do you fight for?&quot;

	Ranma and Kodachi stared at the amulet with spellbound e
xpressions as they lost themselves to its power.

	&quot;My loves,&quot; replied Kodachi first.

	&quot;Which are...?&quot; Cologne encouraged.

	&quot;My dearest brother, Tachi,&quot; said Kodachi softly. &quot;And 
Ranma, the only person who truly understands me.&quot;

	&quot;And you, Ranma?&quot; asked Cologne.

	&quot;Family,&quot; Ranma said immediately. &quot;Everybody in my family. 
That especially includes Dachi.&quot;

	Contemplating this, Cologne studied the pair for a long 
moment before she hopped forward to place the amulet around 
Ranma&#39;s neck. After she did this, Cologne hopped away from the 
couple and snapped her fingers.

	Immediately, Ranma and Kodachi woke from the daze they 
had been in and focused on Cologne.

	&quot;What...?&quot; asked Ranma blearily as she touched her 
forehead. &quot;What just happened?&quot; Focusing on Cologne, she frowned 
and said, &quot;What did you just do, old woman?&quot;

	&quot;I was discovering the truth,&quot; said Cologne. &quot;In a fairly 
simple ceremony that happens with all outsiders that are 
introduced into the tribe for reasons other than marriage.&quot;

	Ranma was about to say something more when Kodachi neared 
her and touched her chest lightly. &quot;Ranma darling,&quot; she began 
quietly. &quot;Where did you get this?&quot;

	Following Kodachi&#39;s gaze, Ranma focused on the glowing 
red amulet that she now wore around her neck. Lifting her gaze, 
she looked at Cologne and said, &quot;Lemme guess. You&#39;re the one 
who gave me this little trinket, huh?&quot;

	&quot;Correct,&quot; said Cologne.

	&quot;How come?&quot; asked Ranma suspiciously.

	Her eyes lidded, Cologne wore a near smile of sorts 
before she turned to leave and said, &quot;You will discover that 
soon enough.&quot;

	Watching Cologne&#39;s exit, Ranma scowled before she studied 
the amulet that she was wearing. &quot;Looks valuable,&quot; she noted.

	&quot;I don&#39;t think we should sell it, darling,&quot; said Kodachi. 
&quot;But I also don&#39;t think you should continue to wear it either.&quot;

	&quot;Don&#39;t gotta tell me twice,&quot; Ranma snorted. &quot;This thing 
is too creepy to wear.&quot; She then touched the chain of the amulet 
and started to lift it over her head.

	That was when Ranma got struck by lightning.

	As she bounded away, Cologne noted the cloud of smoke that 
was coming from her newly purchased building and wondered if she 
should have warned the couple that the amulet couldn&#39;t be removed 
without her personal approval.

	No, they were bound to figure it out eventually.
