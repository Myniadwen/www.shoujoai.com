<pre>Tsubasa Shiina paused, the brown haired teen taking a deep breath as she 
stopped by the gate of the school. She was a bit scared, even though she 
had been going to school in Tokyo for nearly a year, but she still 
strived to beat her habit of shyness.

&#39;At least I&#39;m doing well in class,&#39; Tsubasa mused as she took her seat, 
her short hair falling around her face. The brown eyed young woman was 
slim and athletic, already being courted by a few of the sports clubs, 
and she worked hard to maintain a good average grade. &#39;I just wish I had 
more to do out of class,&#39; she admitted.

For most of her life Tsubasa had been haunted by a indescribable 
longing... the sensation of having lost something incredibly precious. 
She tried to ignore it or put it out of her mind, but it always lingered 
in the back of her mind. What was strange was that she couldn&#39;t even say 
what had been lost... just that it had been incredibly dear to her.

&quot;Shiina-san?&quot; the voice murmured quietly behind her.

Tsubasa turned to look at Yuko Okawa, the black haired girl who sat 
behind her. A nice, responsible girl Yuko often found herself saddled 
with class duties that she carried out with a cheerful air. &quot;Yes?&quot; 
Tsubasa asked quietly.

Yuko looked a bit sheepish as she asked, &quot;I didn&#39;t get all the math 
homework... could you go over it with me?&quot;

Tsubasa smiled slightly as she softly answered, &quot;Sure.&quot;

Both girls had their heads bent over the book as Tsubasa ran over last 
day&#39;s work once again, Yuko listening eagerly. The other girl would look 
up and smile at Tsubasa as they worked, reaching out to touch her hand 
as she understood a certain point.

&quot;Good morning class,&quot; the teacher briskly said as he entered, the two 
girls reluctantly seperating and turning to face forward once more.

As the classes continued Tsubasa focused on her work, but she also found 
her thoughts turning to the past. &#39;Was it a friend I lost?&#39; she wondered 
as one teacher left and another arrived, &#39;Is that what I still feel?&#39;

As lunch break arrived Yuko sat across from Tsubasa, sighing in relief. 
&quot;Thanks for helping me,&quot; she smiled, &quot;I was so scared I&#39;d get called on 
and not be able to answer.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d do all right,&quot; Tsubasa said firmly.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Yuko reached out to squeeze Tsubasa&#39;s hand, &quot;but I&#39;m glad you 
were there to help me.&quot;

Tsubasa blushed slightly, &quot;I was glad to help.&quot;

&quot;Look at the lezzies!&quot; a boy cried, laughing, his voice overriding the 
usual buzz of classroom conversation..

Tsubasa found herself jerking to her feet, looking around fiercely, so 
much so everyone around her was cowed. &quot;Who...?&quot; she said fiercely.

&quot;Easy,&quot; the class president stood up, the young woman&#39;s longer brown 
hair swinging as she moved, &quot;no fighting.&quot;

Yuko put her hand on Tsubasa&#39;s arm, &quot;She&#39;s right.&quot;

Tsubasa subsided, sitting back down as she said firmly, &quot;He didn&#39;t have 
the right to say that about you.&quot;

Yuko gave her a thoughtful look, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Tsubasa smiled back, both 
girls finishing their lunches before classes began once more.

Occasionally, Tsubasa wondered how her shy, introverted younger self 
might react to meeting her more outgoing self, now. She knew she had 
changed a lot as she grew into her teens, a process helped by her father 
finally settling to run his own bakery here in Tokyo. Once they stayed 
in one place for awhile Tsubasa began to make friends, and with roots 
came more confidence to stand up for herself.

&#39;I wonder if I should have done something about that guy?&#39; Tsubasa 
wondered as she exchanged smiled and nodded at friends and members of 
her club as they walked out of the gates to the school.

&quot;Yo!&quot; a boy&#39;s voice barked and Tsubasa sighed, turning around to face 
the boy from her class. Shinji Ito wasn&#39;t much taller than Tsubasa, and 
his normally pleasant features were twisted by a sneer.

Tsubasa met his eyes calmly, &quot;Yes?&quot;

Shinji seemed a bit thrown by her calm reaction. &quot;What do you think you 
were doing, carrying on in class?&quot; he demanded.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t doing anything,&quot; Tsubasa replied honestly, keeping a wary eye 
on him.

&quot;Ha!&quot; Shinji replied, &quot;Everyone knows about you and Yuko.&quot;

Tsubasa met his eyes calmly as she answered, &quot;Then they&#39;d better tell 
me, because I haven&#39;t heard anything.&quot;

Shinji grit his teeth as he growled, &quot;Don&#39;t mock me!&quot;

&#39;Oh great,&#39; Tsubasa mentally sighed as Shinji snapped. With a roar he 
charged at her, hands extended. Waiting until nearly the last moment she 
dodged, stepping aside as she thrust a leg out. Shinji tripped, unable 
to dodge at the speed he was going and crashed to the ground as students 
began to laugh at him.

&quot;Why you...!&quot; Shinji pulled himself up, eyes glittering with rage.

Despite knowing it probably wouldn&#39;t help Tsubasa offered, &quot;This doesn&#39;t 
have to go any farther, you know. You can just walk away.&quot;

Shinji glared as he stood, rubbing his hands together. &quot;The only one 
going away,&quot; he growled out, &quot;is you on a stretcher.&quot; Obviously feeling 
the first time was a fluke Shinji charged again, relying on nothing but 
guts and fury.

Sadly, one of the things being picked on as a little girl had caused in 
Tsubasa was a burning desire not to let it happen again. And while she 
wasn&#39;t a black belt in anything she had attended more than one self 
defense class, rather unlike the enraged Shinji. Smoothly she grabbed 
his arm and shifted her weight, redirecting him right towards the wall 
surrounding the school.

&quot;Oww!&quot; Shinji yelped, staggering backwards right into several boy&#39;s 
arms.

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; one said firmly as the other helped hold him up, &quot;you&#39;re 
done.&quot;

&quot;Bu&#39; I c&#39;n,&quot; Shinji slurred, shaking his head to clear the spots in his 
eyes.

&quot;Stop it,&quot; the second guy said, &quot;you&#39;re just looking like a idiot.&quot;

Shinji digested that then looked around him, realizing that most of the 
students were frowning disapprovingly at him, NOT at Tsubasa. He 
straightened up, catching a trickle of blood running down from his nose 
as he tried to say in a dignified way, &quot;You&#39;re lucky I went easy on 
you.&quot; With that he stomped off, not waiting for a answer.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; she sighed to the students who had helped even as the watching 
crowd began to finally disperse.

&quot;Tsubasa!&quot; Yuko cried as she hurried out the school and up the sidewalk 
towards them, nearly throwing herself in her arms. &quot;I came as soon as I 
heard....&quot;

&#39;This is really going to help the rumors,&#39; Tsubasa thought to herself 
wryly. &quot;Everything turned out okay,&quot; she answered as the crowd once more 
fixed interested eyes on them.

Yuko didn&#39;t seem inclined to let go as she looked Tsubasa over and 
softly asked, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine, really,&quot; Tsubasa tried a smile, &quot;if anyone was hurt it was 
him.&quot;

Yuko drew back a bit, taking Tsubasa&#39;s hands in hers as she murmured, 
&quot;If you had been hurt, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do.&quot;

Keeping Yuko&#39;s hand in her&#39;s Tsubasa started them walking home, the 
other students clearing the way as they walked together. &#39;I think we 
have some things to talk about,&#39; she thought as she felt the cold, empty 
place within her begin to warm at last. &quot;Wanna walk home with me&quot; she 
asked softly.

&quot;I&#39;d love too, Yuka purred.

End

death of her &#39;sister&#39; Hikaru, even if she did get erased from her 
memory. All characters other than Tsubasa are Ocs, names based on mixing
