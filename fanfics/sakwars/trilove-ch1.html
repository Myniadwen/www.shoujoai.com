------------------------------------------------------------

Sumire walked towards her own room as she began to daydream to herself 
about her own secret love. &#39;I know I only do this to you because I 
don&#39;t want to be obvious but... the more I do this to you the more I 
fall in love with you. Gods, I can&#39;t take it anymore!&#39;. Her thoughts 
began to scream at her as she got to her room, walked inside and 
locked it shut. she walked to her bed and let herself land on the bed 
sighing.

&quot;I love you Kanna!&quot;, she said in a small voice and began to kiss the 
pillow as if it were the redhead&#39;s face. &quot; She has got to be mine!&quot;

******

Maria in the meantime was in the shooting range, practicing her focus 
as she shot the far away target with deadly aim.

&quot;I love her, I love her not, I love her, I love her not, I love her, I 
love her not... I love her...&quot; her almost inaudible sentence hanged 
when she had fired the last bullet, her monotone face began to soften 
into a much warmer smile that showed her beutiful features. It had 
been a long time since she had loved another, but now she had started 
again to feel slowly the emotonal side that she had been lost since 
the pain of her loss. This sign making the Russian more enlightend 
than before.

&quot;How can one girl make me feel like this? She has been there for me 
through and through and yet I do nothing? Kanna... I love you so 
much..so much and yet I do nothing to resiprocate these feelings to 
you. I must make it a point to do so to see results.&quot; and with those 
words Maria took her pistol, kept it under her heavy fur coat and left 
the area with blissful thoughts.

******

Kanna decided to make herself a huge pot of ramen to go with the pork 
dumplings she just brought from her afternoon jog around the city,she 
had prepaired the ingredients and put the dumplings on a plate, also 
cooking the noodles in the boiling water she prepaired earlier that 
noon. She was very hungry, after all those miles around the area.. 
twice was bound to make her hungry after the workout. She began to 
hear footsteps and saw Reni walking towards her.

&quot;Hey there buddy, how are you doing today?&quot;

&quot;Nothing much really, I have decided to practice my lines and go for a 
nap after that...&quot;

The younger girl let the sentence hang as Kanna added the fresh 
ingredients to the boiling noodles and put the ramen to a slow boil, 
Reni letting herself sit on the chairs next to the dining table 
waiting for the martial artist to finnish. After adding the sauce, 
Kanna mixed the meal and put the ramen on simmer, letting herself sit 
with Reni and relax.

&quot;So Reni, what did you want to talk about? You seem to be a little 
nervous there.&quot; the silver-haired girl was surprised at Kanna&#39;s 
accurate observance making her blush almost unoticibly. &quot;Kanna... what 
is love?&quot; the topic made the tall woman nervousas she heared the 
question, &#39;Man, this child just had to bring up that darned subject! 
Gods, how am I gonna say this??&#39; Kanna gulped down an occuring lump in 
her throat an stared at Reni for a while.

&quot;Okay... what do you want to know?&quot; she smiled with a nervous faint 
laugh.

&quot;Is love really necesarry for the progression of our group?&quot;

&quot;Yes! Without this emotion we cannot even trust our commrades enough 
to let them continue with this valuable component. Without this 
respect then how can we even be cooperating with each other? Was that 
it?&quot;

&quot;Not exactly...&quot; the look on Reni&#39;s face began to look serious, her 
real problem was about to come out.

&quot;It&#39;s about Iris.. she has begun to look at me in a way I have not 
seen before, it seems as if she was trying to get my attention in a 
being in love state while not trying to attract attention to any of 
the othe members. I have been noticing this behavior and have also 
been playing along.. but I am starting to feel attracted to her... 
what am I going to do Kanna?&quot; a sigh came fron Reni&#39;s breath, her eyes 
closing releaved that she was able to take away the bruden that had 
been troubling her for al long time.

Kanna was very amazed at the events unfolding to her, had she heared 
that from Reni? The kid with the soldier mentality?... she was so 
dead.. &quot;Um, er..hmm... how about asking her and stuff like that! Ha ha 
ha ha, that&#39;s it.&quot; laughing aloud as she smiled nervously smled on,if 
she only knew how bad she is with lovey-dovey thingies she was then 
the whole conversation would have been dodged.. but who was she to 
argue. She got back up and got two bowls of ramen plus the plate of 
dumplings and made sure that Reni wanted some, the german agreed. With 
that said the whole convesation was looked into.

******

Maria and Sumire began to walk to the kitchen for a late lunch, Sakura 
was with Orihime and Oogami for a small chat in a restaurant while 
Kouran and Iris were in the basement tuning the koubu and having a 
nice pic-nic lunch downstairs. The Russian and the Japanese girl were 
discussing strategy and productions of past plays when they both 
stoped at the entrance of the kitchen, inside were Kanna and Reni 
sitting down eating a bowl of piping hot ramen and having a hearty 
conversation, With an embarrased Kanna laughing out loud and a more 
serious Reni giggling along in the antics.

Sumire watched enchanted by the tall redhead&#39;s actions, Kanna was just 
so kind and sweet that even the hardend Reni was able to loosen up to 
her after only a few months being introduced in the troop.

Maria was internally blushing when she saw the martial artist 
impersonating her with a very hot wild side, this was making the 
russian feel something unfamiliar inside of herself.. wanting to 
pounce on Kanna right there and then some...

After a few more laughs Reni had begun to notice the two other troop 
members watching both of them in the middle of there laughfest.

&quot;Ms. Tachibana, Ms. Kazaki! Please join us for lunch. Ms. Krishima 
made such good ramen and also shared some of her pork dumplings with 
me. She is such a good cook! Ms. Krishima please let them have some of 
your wonderful cooking!&quot; the child pleaded with Kanna.

&quot;He he he... okay then, since you put it that way. I made such a big 
batch that I have enough for seven people. Come on then, the meal is 
on me! Kanna laughed aloud itching the back of neck, Kanna was getting 
nervous that both girls decided to go together and eat with them.

&#39;Oh God! Both of them here right now... Reni! Stop making that face at 
me! Maybe I shouln&#39;t have told her about it.. God... if she opens her 
mouth about it she is going to get in deep trouble with me!&#39; Kanna 
thought to herself. It seems that in the conversation when Kana and 
Reni were still alone, The silver-haired child was able to get some 
very interesting facts from the martial artist. It seems that Kanna 
has an interest with the gun-slinging russian and the elegant petite 
japanese woman, but having a dificulty trying to choose one from the 
other.. they both have some good qualities, some bad but it did not 
interfere with the thought of a date with both... still.. she didn&#39;t 
want to be some sort of a player with two girls that would have killed 
her if they found out about an affair. She already had a hard time 
telling both girls separately but Maria and Sumire in the same room.. 
this is too much!

Reni, being seated one chair away from Kanna had the opportunity to 
see the the events unfold in front of her. She could see kanna in 
front of her sweating with so much anxiety that she looked like a 
fountain in a beautiful garden.. this is going to be fun! Plus with 
Maria and Sumire around, she was going to enjoy the Martial Artist 
breakdown in horror (God! this is going to be &#39;the&#39; experience to 
be!).

Maria and Sumire got a bowl and sat themselves next to Kanna, the 
blonde on the right and the brunnette on the left. The four Flower 
Troupe members began to converse in random topics given out. As time 
went on, the two members seated on each side of the very tallest 
member of the troupe began to eye on the prey like two cats eyeing a 
cute, defenseless mouse. Both Maria and Sumire have noticed each 
other&#39;s actions and thus began the death stares and evil eye to each 
other, Now rivals for Kanna&#39;s affections. Both knowing the situation 
at hand, began ploting a way to win the redhead&#39;s heart.

Maria began to manuver her leg on Kanna&#39;s muscular one and began to 
caress it slowly up and down.. making Kanna pause. &#39;What the hell is 
going on! Maria&#39;s playing footsie with me! What the hell am I gonna 
do?? Oh no.. Oh no! Oh no! What in the friggin&#39; hell is Sumire doin&#39; 
to me!&#39;. Panic spread to her as she slowly began to stare to her left, 
what she saw almost made her pass out.. Sumire had been hugging her 
arm, kanna&#39;s sculpted arm were sandwiched by Sumire&#39;s clothed breasts 
being ground in a begging rhythm.

A desperate look had been was being signal to Reni for help, the child 
began to look at Kanna with so much rumor..&#39; Well, I know it had to 
end sometime might as well be useful somehow.&#39; the silver-haired child 
sighed in regret, she wanted to see so much more but it seems that 
Kanna had enough suffering for today.

&quot; Ms. Krishima.. whould you please assist me to the training room so I 
may learn some techniques from the famous Ryuu Kyuu Dojo?&quot;

&quot; Ok then Reni, I&#39;ll be glad to!! May I be excused Ladies??&quot;

With those words Kanna took her bowl to the sink and excused herself 
with Reni, brisk walking towards the exit and heading towards the 
traing hall.

After both girls left Maria began to stand up to rinse of her bowl. 
Sumire staring evily to her russian rival.

&quot; You know Sumire, she can not be yours right?&quot;

&quot; Like she&#39;ll be yours either, I mean how can she go for a 
dark-hearted girl like you. I think I&#39;m better suited for her anyway 
since I am pretier than you anyway.&quot;

With that Sumire left the kitchen to plan ahead for the battle of her 
heart wth Kanna as prize. Maria was left to clean the dishes, after 
all she was the last one there. As she began to wash the bowls she 
stared out the window thinking about that special Redhead with such 
beautiful eyes.
