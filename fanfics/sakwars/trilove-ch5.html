<h1>The Bizarre Triangle of Love (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../sakwars/index.html">Sakura Wars</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sniperdread.html">Sniper Dread</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../sakwars/trilove-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>|...|- This is Kanna&#39;s brain talking... What a beaut! 


This was one of the worst days of her life, it had to be; you find the 
girl of your dreams who is sweet and kind who ends up having to marry 
some other rich snob who in fact does not care at all. Reni was 
definately very pissed and heartbroken, who wouldn&#39;t be if you were in 
love! She dragged herself to protest her desire to not see this young 
man who had made her existance cut-off, walking even slower to not see 
Iris&#39; reactions. 


If anyone was there in the room was not oblivious to both Reni&#39;s and 
Jean&#39;s looks, they could have passed for being long lost twins separated 
at birth.. it seems that this senario does not recognize both of their 
looks as a phenomena and will be ignored for the rest of the whole story 
(^-^..haha!). After an akward silence Iris broke the uneasiness of both 
her silver haired friends by simply coughing, standing in between them 
both. 

&quot;Reni, Iris wants to introduce you to Jean. Jean this is Reni!&quot; the 
blonde said cheerfully as she saw Orihime leave quietly, as if to get 
out of anymore impending disaster as she would have predicted will 
happen if anything would happen to Iris. Reni and Jean began to glare at 
each other as if to be annoyed at each others existance and began to 
shake hands slowly as if one or the other was to reach for a weapon, 
Iris giggled nervously seeing the rivalry that began to brew. 

&quot;Such a magnificent place you live in Iris!&quot; Jean showing amazement as 
he quickly let go of Reni&#39;s hand, taking a few steps and glancing around 
the room. 

&quot;Ragafragitstupafrikin&#39;gettingintheway&#39;...&quot; Reni mumbled, knowing Jean 
had heared and has chosen to ignore it for the time being. 

&quot;Would you like Iris to take you for a tour?&quot; 

&quot;Why certainly my petite fleure, It would be my pleasure. Um, Leni can 
you hang my coat and make sure that you hang it separately from the 
others.. I don&#39;t want it to be ruined.&quot; handing the coat to Reni gently 
while the german girl stared on, angered at the gesture. Iris giving an 
expresion of apology, knowing that Reni took that as an offense. Jean 
extended an arm out that Iris obliginly took and began to walk around 
slowly, happily chating and giggling now and then. 

A light blue aura began to acumulate around Reni. 

****** 

&#39;No! No no nonononononono, NO! this is not happening, I repeat! This is 
NOT happening... ohhhh Goddess...&#39; 

|Whoa..... that felt gooood....| 

&#39;Yeah........&#39; 

Kanna had felt Maria&#39;s hands ever so slowly caress her inner thigh and 
was getting higher by every second, the redhead&#39;s whole mental systems 
shut down for that moment and was about to go with the flow of things 
when something stoped her happy happy self, it was her morals (for the 
good Kanna!) that began to scream the most painful doom she will have to 
suffer FOHEVAH! Surely enough Kanna gave Maria a long stare, took the 
blonde&#39;s hand away carefully, and jumped out of the bed.. backing up a 
corner. 

|What the HELL are you doing! Get back there NOW!!| 

&#39;No! Don&#39;t you understand, something is upseting the balance.. can&#39;t you 
feel it?&#39; 

|Look, if you don&#39;t go back there right now I will knock the balance 
off-.. you know what... you&#39;re right something&#39;s not right somehow..| 

-Meanwhile- 

&quot;Ultimate sucess, Mwa ha ha ha!!&quot; Kouran laughed manically.. she had 
just created something soooo special, that it did not blow up on her in 
any way. She had been conducting the experiments for weeks now and 
finally was able to finally see the fruits of hard labor. The purple 
haired girl had just created a chemical compound that if one single drop 
would be realeased, it will separate the item into a very complete 
opposite of itself. 

Three days ago, a test eperiment on a sheet of regular paper had made it 
into two diffrent sheets of paper.. separating its positive views and 
negative views so completely that they contrast so much yet if put 
together makes complete sense. The vial that she had was enough to 
change the whole theatre, and she had not created a reverse compound if 
anything went wrong. Kouran kept the vial in a pouch and put it inside 
her pocket, and left her lab to get a sandwich. 

-Back to the scheduled fic- 

&quot;There is no possible escape Kanna, give in to me!&quot; Maria said in a low 
voice and began to walk slowly towards her prey, with 
predatory/seductive smile included. It seems like the end for Kanna&#39;s 
good side... but wait! There was a knock on the door with outbursts from 
Sumire, the redhead thanking and cursing this moment at the same time 
seeing Maria freeze. 

At that moment, Kanna dashed to the window, clicked the hinges and 
opened the only exit available for the time being. The blonde gave her a 
stern look that would have petrified her if it weren&#39;t for her fear of 
Sumire barging in the room, she had decided not to move for a while 
while the rusian got her robe on and went for the door. At that given 
moment, she pushed the window wide open and jumped out straight towards 
a thick growth of bushes that had saved her in her fall but has given 
her a couple of cuts and bruises that she could take care later. That 
moment, she needed a breather. 

-Upstairs, Maria&#39;s Room- 

&quot;Maria, let me in! I know she&#39;s in there!&quot; Sumire roared as she began to 
slam on the door, giving more exerted power to the ramming that the door 
finally fell open. The brunette charged in and began her search, she had 
been looking the whole day in every place the theatre had and Maria&#39;s 
room was the last one in her list. The japanese girl began to feel a 
sense of dread and fear that the russian might have already had her way 
with Kanna, that could have broken her heart. 

&quot;What are you doing Sumire? Kanna&#39;s not in here.&quot; 

&quot;You mean she&#39;s not here anymore..&quot; Sumire walked towards the window 
watching Kanna do a mad dash to the front entrance of the theatre, 
clothes a bit ruffled with a few leaves here and there. 

The japanese girl quickly left Maria&#39;s room to chase after Kanna, while 
Maria stood still for the moment then shaking her head for a moment. 

&quot;Kanna... what am I going to do without you..&quot; the rusian sighed as she 
began to dress up and planed her next counter.

I has been a few weeks since I posted anything here. I&#39;m not sure but I 
might take this fic out of this site, for real.. I&#39;m looking for a 
permanent site, or if I can&#39;t find one It&#39;ll take me a real long time to 
update since I don&#39;t have intenet anymore -in reality, I DON&#39;T have 
internet at all- so don&#39;t whine and complain &#39;bout the fact that I don&#39;t 
update, I do.. its just that I take my time and try to at least make the 
story work, plus spelling. I don&#39;t do the review thing (15 reviews) 
anymore since its a pain on my side, and I can&#39;t keep up at all. I also 
have a new fic in the Sailormoon section called &#39;I have a date..! With 
destiny that is..&#39; check it out and review if you like it! Well, see ya! </pre>
