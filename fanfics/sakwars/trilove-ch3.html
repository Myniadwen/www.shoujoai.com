<h1>The Bizarre Triangle of Love (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../sakwars/index.html">Sakura Wars</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sniperdread.html">Sniper Dread</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../sakwars/trilove-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>It was such nice weather today, bright sun and cloudy sky painted the 
heaven above them.. them being the two youngest members of the Flower 
Troupe. walking around the colorful garden while talking to each other 
about the general things in life, you know.. family, friends, happy 
stuff, sad things, *crushes*... Iris could not just stop talking about 
the crushes she had in France. The list was mostly all the cute French 
boys she could remember, she switched every month or week depending on 
the pretty boy&#39;s look.

Reni in her part was getting jealous with each passing name she heard, 
&#39;I swear, I meet any of those punks mentioned.. I am going to *Pow!* 
and send them fliying out of this place..&#39; she huffed and made a light 
scowl. The blonde girl smiled to herself, knowing she had gotten to 
her goal.

&quot;Are you okay Reni?&quot;

&quot;Yes I am fine..&quot;

&quot;Then why are you like that then?&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot;

&quot;Like you&#39;re jealous..&quot;

&quot;I am not jealous at all, why should I?&quot;

A light giggle came from the French girl&#39;s lips, the sound was like a 
wave of bliss to the Wunderkind soldier. Such a sound should be stored 
in a bottle and be given to the bravest of soldiers to calm there 
souls and strenghten there spirit, what she would give for that sound! 
But then... what was she to her anyway? A friend to her only, what 
more.. with that another soft sigh came, she seemed lost in hope 
anyway so what she to do? Reni was already sure that Iris was matched 
up with a more suitable man to be with anyway.. she can&#39;t just try to 
barge in the parents&#39; choices like that. The silver-haired girl 
slumped forward and began to follow the girl in front of her, very 
depresed at the situation at hand.

&#39;This was not the reaction I was looking for! Reni, I&#39;m so sorry if I 
hurt you!&#39; Iris thought as she looked back at Reni who still had her 
head down. She had always thought of Reni as a very nice girl.. also 
&#39;handsome&#39; in such ways. Reni had such an expression that she thought 
was so puppy-like, a crown of silver hair that match the contours of 
her face perfectly, eyes as blue as the ocean itself.. she could have 
drowned in those pools of blue. The blonde blushed as she had more 
thoughts of the soldier.. Reni had got to be much better than all 
those boys she met in France.. definately much better.

Reni had been staring at the floor for a few moments now, she could 
see those petite blue shoes standing very still so suddenly turning 
into her direction. a little bit surprised at what was happening she 
began to lift her head slowly, at the same time that Iris was mooving 
closer towards her. The silver-haired girl finally got her head at the 
proper position staring into purple eyes that had made all her will 
scamper away. After a silent exchange of glances Iris smiled and 
slowly began her decend on Reni&#39;s lips. lifting herself higher with 
the means of her toes, she closed her eyes and slowly placed her lips 
upon Reni&#39;s own.

A few more seconds of this kiss was like bliss to both, like a never 
ending fairytale to both their stories. After a few more seconds Iris 
reluctantly let go and got herself back to her position on her feet, 
while Reni was blushing lightly and was also shocked by Iris&#39; actions.

&quot;Reni, are you okay?&quot; The blonde giggled

&quot;U-u-u-u-u-u-uh-huh..&quot; (^-^)

&quot;Well, come on now! Do you wanna just stare the whole day? Let&#39;s go!&quot;

&quot;Wh-wha?&quot;

At that, Iris had pulled Reni by the wrist running towards another 
part of the garden. The silver-haired girl still blushing and a little 
off also.

******

&quot;Kanna, Kanna where are you?&quot; Sumire called out loudly, she had looked 
in every place she knew Kanna would be but alas.. she couldn&#39;t find 
her. She finally gave up and walked away, starting her search tommorow 
so she would have more time to think of a better plan to get Kanna. As 
she left, a small part of red could be seen in a dark shadowy parts of 
the hallway. It was Kanna alright, making sure that Sumire was out of 
sight before heading towards her room. As she got there she made 
another check-up on both left and right side of her and when she 
thought it was safe she quickly opened the door and shut it without a 
banging sound and locked it securely.

Kanna was now begining to get a little paranoid after that incident 
with Sumire in onsen, after all.. who wouldn&#39;t be, considering that 
she was the only person who acts like a typhon when they both got into 
arguments. Getting a little cold, she got to her dresser and began to 
get some clothing and droped her towel and falling on the floor, 
covering her ankles. She dressed up quickly then looked at the mirror.

&#39;God that was close! I thought I was gonna&#39; loose it back there!&#39;

|Why the hell did you have to leave you dumbass! Didn&#39;t you notice she 
was givin&#39; on you free?!|

&#39;Hey! I&#39;m not that type of girl! Why don&#39;t you just shut up &#39;cause I&#39;m 
in the controls here anyway!&#39;

|I was about to get some action back there!! You fool, why did you 
have to leave?!|

&#39;Like I said, I&#39;m in controls.. if you don&#39;t want is so much then why 
don&#39;t leave or something?&#39;

|Man, I swear I will.. just you see.|

&quot;Okay then.&quot; she had agreed with her brain and let the subject fall. 
She had spotted the dried cloth on her head and tossed it on her bed, 
combing her hair with her own hands. Kanna made sure she looked fine 
then wore her boots back on. She finally got herself presentable even 
though inside she was already getting so insane-like in her thinking 
mode. She then got out of her room to go to the salon, she needed a 
drink pretty badly.

******

Maria had been in the salon for a while now, drinking a glass of 
something she had concocted herself. The drink a little too strong for 
her since her face was a little pink, but still.. she could damn take 
it. She had been thinking of Kanna since this morning, she couldn&#39;t 
help it though -She was in love!- and it wasn&#39;t helping at all that 
she was fantasising of Kanna either. That body was just so muscular 
yet oh so soft.. she couldn&#39;t wait to get a peice of that ass (-_-;;;) 
that was just so damn perfect.

After a few moments of quiet, silent footsteps anounce the arival of 
Kanna to the salon. She paused as she saw Maria who still had her back 
at the martial artist, Kanna was already having thoughts of getting 
out before anymore trouble begins, but she decided against it and just 
went with the flow of her mood -to get a drink, dammit, a drink- and 
relax. she stared at Maria and bashfully waited.

Maria all of a sudden felt a sensation in the room and turned towards 
Kanna&#39;s direction, a happy feeling went through her like a lighting 
bolt from the heavens.. a sign perhaps that she can have the one she 
desired the most for herself, alone.

&quot;Hello there Kanna, how has it been?&quot;

&quot;A little odd I guess..?&quot;

&quot;Well, come have a seat then. I&#39;ll fix you a drink so you can feel 
better.&quot;

Maria left her seat and went behind the bar, standing in silence a 
very good plan hit her and she began to gather several bottles. She 
began to measure and mix several liquids in a shaker then began to 
vigerously shake the container. Upon finishing, she took a taste an 
showed a satisfied look. She took a glass an poured the concoction in 
a mug and slid it towards Kanna, who in fact.. caught it.

The tan girl looked at the offered drink and at its owner then back at 
the drink, she felt so guilty just taking a sip for it looked so 
magnificent with its colors mixing together.. but then again that&#39;s 
why she went down anyway and took several hearty gulps. The face of 
serenity with a little flush washed her face.

&quot;Maria.. this is sooo good!&quot;

&quot;Thank you Kanna..&quot; a faint blush darkend Maria&#39;s already flushed 
face.

&quot;How do you know how to do this?&quot;

&quot;Since I worked as a bouncer in a club, the bartender would teach me 
some things after closing time. He got some of his friends to taste my 
creations and also teach me how to make other drinks in our free 
time.&quot;

It seems that Kanna could not get enough of the drink and asked Maria 
to make some more, which she was happy to make. Unknown to the martial 
artist.. that recepe that the blonde kept making was suppose to be 
only taken in three servings because it was very potent in alcohol 
levels, its sweetness hiding its danger...



&quot;Mariiaaahhh..*hic*..whyzzz threrrre twwwoo offff-&quot;

&quot;Kanna?&quot;

With a very loud thump, Kanna had passed out on the floor as Maria 
looked at her with a very seductive smile. &quot;At last, my chance!&quot; she 
quietly said as she slowly got out of the bar and began to lift a very 
heavy and muscular (very) Kanna and slowly started the long journey to 
her room.
