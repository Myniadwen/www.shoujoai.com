The sound of a force hitting a punching bag was heared from the 
training room, Kanna had been hitting the thing since Reni and her got 
there after that affair in the kitchen..&#39;Wow, Is it just me or is it 
getting hotter in here?&#39; the redhead thought as she gave the bag a 
harder beating. For her working out made things much easier to grasp 
since the activity was a great stress reliever, being a martial artist 
this activity was important to her well-being.

&#39;Just a little more rounds then I&#39;m ready for some action... yeah, 
some good ol&#39; hot, spicy, horny, in heat, down on the bed action... 
Where the in hell did that come from?!?&#39; Kanna stoped herself and 
stoped the bag to think about what she just heared from her brain.

|For God&#39;s sake Kanna, why don&#39;t you just get both girls and get in on 
a little action! I know how freaky you can get after that whole thing 
in the kitchen.. I know you wanted to pour some honey on Sumire&#39;s t-|

&#39;What the fuck are you talkin&#39; about! You saw how near I was into 
getting a heart attack back there didn&#39;t you! I swear to God, what 
happend to those girls anyway? Is this some sort of post-apocalyptic 
prophecy &#39;cause I feel this is going to get to me later on, isn&#39;t it?&#39;

|Suit yourself girl, all I know That maybe later on.. maybe I can get 
my groove on!|

&quot;Shut Up&quot;

Reni heared Kanna barking out in the corner still holding on to the 
punching bag, the silver-haired child thought that the Okinawa native 
had gone a little insane and was trying to hold herself back together 
again. Man, if it had happen to her she could have gone crazy too! 
&#39;Thank you God for making Iris so naive!&#39; she smiled to herself with 
that thought.

Ms. Krishima, are you okay back there? You seem a little tense there.&quot; 
Reni asked the martial artist. Kanna snaped back to reality looking at 
Reni with a distant look in her face. &quot; Yeah I&#39;m o.k. Reni, I&#39;m a 
little shaken though..&quot; getting a little sweaty from the &#39;heat&#39; and 
the nervousness that&#39;s been bothering her. The more she thought about 
the confrontation the more she seemed to sweat and the more her brain 
gave her naughty things to think about the more she got hot. How was 
she going to avoid both girls was the only thing she can reasonably 
think about and she was trying not to give Reni to much attention 
about the new heights her blood pressure was taking her.

&quot;Ms. Krishima.. I think you need a bath now. your starting to sweat 
like crazy.&quot;

&quot;..maybe I should, I feel so stressed out. Maybe a cold shower would 
wake me up from this nightmare. Oh.. thanks for bailing me out there 
Reni, you saved my life back there. I owe you big time for everything&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay Ms. Krishima, it was nothing. Although you should have 
been much calmer about the situation so one could have been more 
&#39;alert&#39; to the emergency.&quot;

&quot;God it wasn&#39;t my fault, was it?! Either they both already knew or 
were playing some sort of trick with me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m safe to 
even stay here in the theatre any longer.&quot;

&quot;Please stop over reacting and calm down Ms. Krishima. I think that 
was just some sort of practical joke being played on you.. I think 
that you should take that shower of yours because your starting to 
smell you know..&quot;

Kanna turned her head from side to side sniffing the air surrounding 
her, she was started to smell a little punjent. She had realized that 
Reni had pinched her nose in the process, she looked at the child with 
a mock hurt expression. &quot;Stop that! I don&#39;t smell that bad... Do I?&quot; 
Reni laughed out lout as she saw the redhead pout back at her, glad 
that Kanna had calmed down a little bit.

&quot;Well, after that workout I really think you should go before you 
catch your death of cold.&quot;

&quot;O.k. then it&#39;s settled, I&#39;m taking a shower! As a matter o&#39; fact, I&#39;m 
going now!&quot;

&quot;Well then I will see you later Ms. Krishima, maybe you can actually 
&#39;train&#39; me with your famous techniques.&quot;

&quot;Hahahahahahahahaa... I&#39;m so sorry Reni, I promise I&#39;ll train with you 
later.. Heck I&#39;ll even teach you the sparring technique my Papa 
thought me!&quot;

&quot;Thank you very much, I can probably use the training later on for 
offensive strategy. See you later.&quot;

With that exchange Reni left the Training Hall, leaving Kanna by 
herself. Looking around her surroundings, she picked up an unused 
towel and left for the onsen.

******

Reni began to walk to the exit towards the garden, she decided to 
relax a little bit and enjoy the scenery and peace for a while before 
she did anything else for the afternoon. As she walked out to meet the 
bright sunshine she was bumped back and fell hard on the floor, 
suprised and winded from the hit she took. her head shooked a bit and 
started to look up to the person who had knocked her out from her 
destination. As she began to trail up she heard a small whimper that 
sounded quite familiar, she was right.. it was Iris.

Iris&#39;s eyes were shut tight as her arms held unto her Jean-Paul in an 
eye-poping embrace, she opened her eyes to look into a pair of light 
blue ones.. it was Reni. She blushed and looked down on the floor 
embarrased for not acting like a matured girl around the German girl, 
she wanted Reni to notice her more for her gracefulness and all things 
proper. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Reni, Iris should have been more careful..&quot; a sad 
look flashed on her face.

Reni saw this and began to stand up, after dusting herself off she 
gave a hand toward the French girl. She held the hand extended to her 
and felt it pulling her in a fast speed, Iris&#39;s lips was a few 
centemeters near Reni&#39;s.. there eyes were staring into each other. It 
took a long time before both stared to notice began to look away, 
blushing as red as Sakura&#39;s ribbon.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I am sure it was not your fault anyway. Is it something 
urgent?&quot;

&quot;Not at all Reni. Iris was just about to get something in Iris&#39;s room 
so Iris decided to just run, and just as Iris got to open the door you 
were there and Iris crashed on to you. Where were you going anyway?&quot;

&quot;Outside, I decided to enjoy the simplicity of the garden and relax 
for a while.. would you want to come with me?&quot;

&quot;Yes definately!&quot;

It had seemed that she forgot what she wanted to do and decided to 
walk with Reni all along.. that was all she wanted to do, to walk with 
the girl that had captivated her for the short period she had been 
there. Knowing she was the only little girl there, it comforted her 
that Reni was there because she needed someone to talk to as a young 
girl she just was. She Knew that Oogami was just a crush that she had 
gotten rid off the window after Reni came, As far as she&#39;s concered.. 
nobody should dare steal her new friend because she can raise all hell 
if she had to.

They both began to walk back outside, side by side..like a very cute 
couple.

******

&#39;Where the hell is Kanna? If I don&#39;t find her in time Maria probably 
might have gotten to her and that is DEFINITELY not good!&#39; Sumire 
fumed to herself. She was not going to let Kanna get away from her 
that easily.. She almost had her to.

She began to look in every room she had the chance to look into, but 
no Kanna. she was about to give up in her search and start on tommorow 
but she noticed something going on in the onsen, to her curiosity she 
silently went in to find out for herself.

Sumire&#39;s eyes almost poped out... in her sight was a very naked Kanna, 
scooping her clothes and putting it on bench so she can probably wash 
it later. The petite girl hid herself so as not to be seen, she was 
already getting hot in that thought of seeing the redhead without her 
clothes on. Kanna was so muscular and very defined, her eyes couldn&#39;t 
help looking at the sight that was being shown to her (thank you 
God!).

The martial artist went in the shower to scrub of the grime that had 
build up since this morning and was humming a tune from an old 
production they had played.. &#39;The Happy Prince&#39; was the name that 
poped in her head, she loved that {Wahahahahaha} part because it kept 
her happy just to think about it. Her silouette hidden in a 
translucent curtain. After that she went out of the shower, dried 
herself up and diped in the big bath tub to soak in for a while.

She dipped a small towel in a bucket filled with cold water, wrung the 
thing a little bit, folded it in a small rectangle, and placed it on 
her head so she wouldn&#39;t overheat while relaxing in the tub by 
herself. Kanna began to let herself go and closed her eyes, dreaming 
about the beach and other tropical wonders she had missed since she 
left Okinawa.

|This is the life..*huhhmm*.. I wish we can stay longer.|

&#39;You said it. Nothing like a relaxing bath to relieve your stress and 
your muscles. We can stay a little longer but I don&#39;t really want to 
have pruned skin either, lets stay for 5 minutes then have a snack.&#39;

|Yes, lets.|

After a long sigh Kanna was now not going to pay anymore attention to 
anything her ears hear, letting herself go to meditate about home.

This was Sumire&#39;s big chance to get Kanna for herself, she took off 
her kimono and began to creep towards the bathtub trying hard to not 
make any sound and not get noticed. She was finally next to Kanna who 
was giggling slightly and went back to meditate silently. The younger 
girl slowly and carefully sliped in the water so she wouldn&#39;t step on 
kanna, she lowered herself in front of Kanna and began to smile 
seductively.

&quot;Kanna..&quot;

&quot;Hrhmm?&quot; The redhead was pulled out from her dream state, wondering 
who was calling her name. She slowly opened her eyes to meet a pair of 
dark brown ones, her own widend.

&#39;Oh my God!&#39;

|Oh yes!|

&#39;Please go away!&#39;

&#39;Stay my pretty, stay!|

&#39;Shut up!&#39;

|Never!|

Kanna tried to get away but she got pined on the shoulders, then she 
noticed... Sumire wasn&#39;t wearing any thing at all. She began to have a 
light nosebleed.

|Va va voom!|

&#39;Holy Shit!&#39;

The tall girl started to protest and started to lightly strugle 
because the other part of her brain said so, until Sumire started to 
lower her head for a kiss... her chest being pressed against Sumire&#39;s. 
&quot;Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!&quot; she screamed and blushed as red as a 
tomato, she got out of the tub and wraped the towel around her and 
grabed her clothes away from the bench, running barefoot to get out of 
there.

&quot;What did I do?&quot; Sumire stared and pouted at the door Kanna went 
through.

******

Sakura and Orihime were talking about the fun time they had while 
going to the park with Oogami, giggling also because he sliped from 
the bridge they were crossing to get to the part where they had the 
wonderful Koi pond. As they chated and walked towards a hallway, they 
both saw a blur of red hair running towards the bedroom quarters. It 
was Kanna, obviously. In a towel, she ran holding her clothes on her 
left and holding on to secure her towel with the right hand.. a peice 
of folded cloth still hanged on for dear life on her head.

&quot;What in the world is Kanna doing running around in a towel? What do 
you think Sakura?&quot;

&quot;Maybe a snake perhaps, you know how much she&#39;s so scared of those 
things. Oh well, maybe a pipe busted the shower again and she got 
blasted with cold w-&quot;

&quot;Kanna wait!!!&quot;

Sakura and Orihime&#39;s eyes widened when they saw Sumire running in the 
direction Kanna went to, her kimono slipping almost exposing her 
breasts (thank God she was able to catch it in time..) and was kind of 
looking upset.

Both girls stared at each other and shook there heads, weirded out 
after seeing what they thought was the most oddest thing they have 
seen in the history of the theatre. Sighing, they went back to there 
conversation thinking about what just happened.
