<h2>a <a href="../sakwars/index.html">Sakura Wars</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sniperdread.html">Sniper Dread</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../sakwars/trilove-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Hello Everyone! I&#39;m so sorry about not being able to write the fic for 
so long. I have been so busy for the past couple of years that I have no 
time for me or for anything else. But NOW I have a computer, so rest 
assured, I now have the POWAH! Anyway, this story is close to being 
scraped, I have lost parts of the ideas I wrote in paper but if any of 
you want help, then by all means, DO! 
..-Evil Kanna Brain speaking 



&#39;Look at him, what does he have that I can&#39;t possibly give Iris?&#39; the 
wunderkind soldier groaned from afar as she stared at the couple who 
walked in from to her. From what Reni could tell, both Iris and the 
Frenchman were in a conversation she couldn&#39;t hear and were giggling to 
each other as if it was an inside joke. Reni didn&#39;t like being left out 
like as if she was a lost puppy, but if she left, Iris would give her 
this gut-wrenching look she couldn&#39;t get out of.. she could see it 
now... 

Iris: (sees Reni leaving) Where are you going Reni? 

Reni: Since you are busy with giving Jean (grumble..) a tour, perhaps I 
should go and see if I have to do- 

Iris: Don&#39;t Leave Iris..(pouts) 

Reni: Really Iris, I have to- 

Iris: ...(pouts even more) 

Reni: (whimpers).. Iris.. 

Iris: (Takes out the Ultimate kneeler, steel resolve breaking, conscious 
melting, googly-eye, mega pout!) 

[Cute shoujo girl registered, not to be used without permission, illegal

Reni: (squeaks in total surrender and fear) okay then.. 

A light giggle broke Reni of her reverie, noticing that Iris and Jean 
were now looking at her. 

&quot;Are you okay Reni?&quot; asked Iris with a bit of a flirtish tone as the 
blonde strode to the soldier and hugged her arm snugly. 

&quot;uhh...hmmm..yes. Yes I am.&quot; Reni replied. She was surprised at the 
sudden affection that the blonde was giving her at the moment. Since 
Iris was looking away from she got to see the jealous scowl Jean was 
sporting. With a victory smirk of her own it had been a mutual agreement 
that both were now total rivals for the coveted heart of an unaware Iris 
Chateaubriand.

-A random hallway somewhere in the theatre- 

&quot;MMMmmmmm-Tastee--Tastee!&quot; Kouran smacked her lips soundly as she left 
the kitchen to go back to her room. This was definitely a great day, and 
to end a great day you need a great four-layer-with-the-ultimate-works 
sandwich to feast on your success. As the chinese girl began her walk to 
her room, tired and very satisfied, she didn&#39;t notice a mussed up Kanna 
walking backwards, tip-toeing and looking around as if she was being 
hunted down (Whahahahah!). 

whumpf! 

Kouran fell and landed on her butt, not noticing the vial slipped from 
pouch and rolled towards the wall. A surprised Kanna yelped in fear, 
thinking it was one of her suitors who were trying to trap her. Noticing 
it was someone else, she sobered up and kneeled next to Kouran. 

&quot;Kouran! I&#39;m so sorry&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s okay, can you pass me that pouch please.&quot; Kouran asked and waited 
as Kanna picked the item in question and handed it to its rightful 
owner. The redhead stood and helped the chinese girl stand. dusting 
themselves, Kouran said her leave and took off to her room. 

Kanna, who was still standing at the same spot, saw something shine a 
few feet from where she was standing. She bent over to take the object 
and straightened up and began examining the bottle which looked like a 
clear sauce container. She opened the lid and took a sniff of the 
liquid, which smelled spicy and was of a light red color to which she 
thought was a sort of tobascco sauce. with this knowledge, held the 
bottle tightly and ran swiftly to her room. Slamming the door as she got 
in and taking a chair to make sure it was locked and surely secured, she 
walked on over to her dresser and placed the bottle along with a bunch 
of other condiments she collected in her sauce cabinet. 

What the hell are those..? 

&quot;Sauces, I collect them stupid&quot; 

Hmmm, okay... You have spicy mango chutney? 

&quot;yeah, I think I do.. wait... Yep! Here it is!&quot; Kanna said as she held 
on to the bottle victoriously. Since she travels a lot, she has a chance 
to try different and exotic flavors. 

I think we have a hot russian and one spicy japanese brunette already 
for those. 

&quot;Shut Up!&quot; 

Hehhehhh... 

&quot;This is pressure, all right! I mean, all of a sudden two women that I 
wish would at least have chances on are now on the path of conquering me 
or something..&quot; 

Your lucky, I mean two hot chicks... 

&quot;Is that the only thing you think about, hot chicks?&quot; 

Yep! And did I tell you they&#39;re hot, very sexy and HOTT! 

&quot;That&#39;s not the way of thinking things, they&#39;re both my friends.. well, 
one of them if she isn&#39;t always at my throat all the frickin&#39; time..&quot; 

Hahah, true.. This has been one frickin&#39; day for you hasn&#39;t it? 

Kanna looked out at the night sky, a crescent moon shone in all its 
brilliance and nodded in silence.. 

-Kouran&#39;s room- 

&quot;Where the hell is IT?!&quot; The green-haired girl groaned out in 
frustration. She had gotten to her room and was about to get ready to go 
to bed when she noticed that her pocket where lighter than when she had 
the vial. Patting her pocket made her know that there was definitely 
nothing in there but the pouch and so she began looking and messing her 
room up and tracing her steps from early on. 

&quot;I really hope no one even thinks of digesting it...&quot; Kouran whispered 
hopefully. 

-Kanna&#39;s room- 

&quot;Ahhhchoooo&quot; Kanna sneezed. 

You got a cold or something? 

&quot;Nope I&#39;m fine. Goodnight.&quot; 

&#39;Night. 

-Outside, in front of the theatre- 

&quot;I really had a great time Iris, shall I see you tomorrow?&quot; Jean asked 
as he bent over to kiss her hand. 

&quot;(Giggles lightly) Iris would love to.&quot; the blonde blushed as she took 
her hand back refinely. She saw Reni flash a jealous frown for a split 
second then go back to that flat expression that she always had. 

Walking over to his ride, Jean gave one last look until tomorrow and 
smiled at his soon-to-be girlfriend. 

&quot;Au revoir ma Petite Fleure!&quot; and with a flying kiss he sent her way, he 
boarded the carriage and went on his way. 

Reni silently glaring at the transport until it was long and gone. She 
didn&#39;t even notice Iris hugging her from her left side until she heard a 
light yawn. 

&quot;Iris is tired. Will Reni walk Iris to Iris&#39;s room?&quot; The blonde asked 
quietly from sleepiness. 

&quot;I will definantly walk you to your room Iris.&quot; The silver answered and 
they both walked towards their rooms. Halfway into the walk, Iris took 
Reni&#39;s hand and weaved her fingers with the soldier&#39;s as they walked in 
calming silence. 

Reaching Iris&#39;s room, the blonde blushed slightly and went on her 
tiptoes and kissed Reni softly on the lips. After what seemed like an 
eternity, Iris got back on her feet and looked towards the ground, 
blushing a little darker. 

&quot;Goodnight Reni.&quot; Iris said shyly and went into her room. 

&quot;Hehhhh... Goodnight..&quot; Reni said with a dreamy look on her face. She 
slightly stggered to her room and dressed for sleep, and when she got 
finnished, she landed on her bed as if she were shot by cupid himself 
and murmured Iris&#39;s name one last time and slept soon after. 

-------------------------------------------------------
