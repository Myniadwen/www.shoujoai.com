<h1>The Bizarre Triangle of Love (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../sakwars/index.html">Sakura Wars</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sniperdread.html">Sniper Dread</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../sakwars/trilove-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>It has been almost an hour and she almost made it, Maria was now a few 
more doors away from the safety of her room.. she was getting tired 
from dragging an unconscious and very heavy Kanna up those stairs and 
all, she should at least have a very striking pair of legs after this 
task, too bad she always seems to wear such long skirts that no one 
will ever notice -Who cares as long as Kanna got to see them when she 
got settled in the room and has waken her beauty up for a show- 
(@.@;;;).

Finally, she had reached her destination which was her room. Maria had 
proped Kanna next to the door to open it and draged her friend -and 
soon to be lover- gently until she had reached her bed and began the 
process of lifting the unconscious body on the bed and closing the 
door quickly and quietly so as not to be suspicious. At last she had 
Kanna where she wanted, there is no way that anything could come 
between this moment and other things less important.. other than 
Sumire at least, who she wished would just have a really big argument 
with Kanna so she can mend the taller girl&#39;s resolution and they can 
both live hapilly ever after.

Maria was still staring at Kanna&#39;s unconscious form, which she 
couldn&#39;t help at all. The martial artist looked like an angel sleeping 
so quietly on a cloud. With all the things she had to do to get Kanna 
upstairs it was a miracle that the martial artist was still not awake 
at all.

-Flashback-

*Thump!*...*Thump!*...

The blonde was still on the fifth step, she only had twelve to go 
after that another round of dragging Kanna on the wooden floor and 
going through two turns towards the safety of her solitude. She turned 
around to look at the redhead to see that she was still not awake. 
Maria had accidently sliped her hold on Kanna as she began to 
frantically get a hold of her love.

*Crash!**Boom!**Baaaammmm!*

A gasp came from Maria as she saw Kanna back on the first floor of the 
theatre, she quickly sped down the steps to see the martial artist&#39;s 
condition. To her surprise and the growing sweatdrop on her head Kanna 
was still not awake at all, as a matter of fact she did not make any 
sound of rousing pain or a small moan...

-End Flashback-

A blank stare was plastered on the blonde&#39;s face as she looked on the 
taller girl, who she had changed positions on the bed to be a little 
more comfortable. A small yawn escaped from Maria&#39;s lips as she also 
began to strech, she was just so tired and just seeing Kanna there on 
her bed had made things more difficult. The blonde had made the 
descision to take a nap and then get on with the festivities, Kanna 
being in her room was a plus since she could make the martial artist 
her teddy bear and cuddle for a few hours or so.

Getting her clothes off (she sleeps nude ya know..) the gun slinger 
got on her bed and proceeded to cover Kanna and herself with her silk 
sheets. She scooched herself closer to Kanna and hugged her in a 
cuddly way and began to drift into her own dreamland.

Iris had dragged Reni near the benches that point to the direction of 
the city, a sight she had adored since she had stayed in the 
confinements of the theatre. The blonde had asked the soldier if she 
would want to sit with her for a while, Reni obliged and sat next to 
Iris. A few moments went on by and all of a sudden Iris stood up, eyes 
wide and with a shocked expression.

&quot;Oh my goodness, Iris forgot!&quot; the blonde began to search her pockets.

&quot;Iris what is wrong?&quot;

&quot;Iris forgot to read the letter, it&#39;s been missing and Iris has been 
looking for it and remembered that it was in Iris&#39; pocket.&quot; with that 
sentence, she took out the crumpled envelope that was addresed from 
France. The petite girl ripped the container, took out the note, and 
began to read it to herself.

Chere Iris,

Bonjour! I have not seen my beutiful flower for a very long time and 
have decided to visit you there in Japan, yes I have been preparing 
for this trip and this is the last letter that I have made before the 
voyage. I arrive to the port at 14th of July and will be ariving at 
the theatre at the 16th. I hope to see you there my love, I can not 
wait.

Jean Claude Pirouqoui

&quot;Oh my God, he&#39;s comming here?!? Reni quick, what date is it?&quot;

&quot;The 16th, why are you-&quot;

&quot;Reni he&#39;s comming, oh my goodness! HE IS COMING!!&quot;

&quot;Iris calm down! Now, who is he?&quot;

&quot;He is Jean Pirouqoui, he is one of my suiters from the same town I 
live in. He is just sooo handsome!&quot;

&quot;Please, Not this again! Iris!&quot;

&quot;Iris there&#39;s someone here who wants to see you!&quot; Orihime yelled from 
the inside of the theater. Iris began to run towards the back door.

&quot;Iris is comming! Come on Reni let&#39;s go!&quot; the blonde yelled out as she 
got in the theatre, the silver haired girl still outside sighing.

&quot;Well, there goes my chance as far as it goes.&quot; she sarcastically 
mumbled as she slowly went back inside the theatre to catch up with 
Iris.

Kanna slowly opened her eyes and saw an unfamiliar lamp attached to 
the ceiling, she knew that the lamp she was looking at was not the 
lamp from the salon. The red head suddenly felt a surging pain all 
over her body that was accompanied with a huge headache, it was like 
she fell of a building and split her skull (what a coingkidink no?) 
and somehow was actually still alive. She needed an icepack and some 
hot water bottles for her beat up body and had to get out of there 
now.

She got up very slowly to try not to injure herself even more, then 
she got to realize where she actually was. Kanna noticed pillows 
around her and felt the solid that she was on top of, which was a 
bed.. this place was obviously a room and by what she was observing so 
far it was probably one of the girl&#39;s rooms. The question on her mind 
was which one, and she was about to find out for herself

One clue was the sheets, which were silk and light. she had no idea 
who would have such exquisite and expensive taste which leave her to 
three choices: Orihime, Sumire, or Maria. Kanna began to look around 
and noticed a moving motion by her side and saw something hidden by 
the sheets, it also had an up and down rhythm so it must be &#39;someone&#39; 
hidden under the blanket. The martial artist slowly reached to the 
opposite side of the silk and pulled the sheet swiftly trying in vain 
to not disturb the sleeping person, doing so exposing the person&#39;s 
body in the process.

Kanna&#39;s heart suddenly stoped beating in the sight of a nude Maria in 
front of her, did she do something the time she passed out to be in 
this senario? the scene seemed to have sparked her brain into talking 
again.

|Kanna, you bastard! where was I when this happened?!?|

&#39;I don&#39;t know! I didn&#39;t do anything!&#39;

|You sly dog! That must definatly been a good l-|

&#39;Shut up! Great Gods, I swear I didn&#39;t do anything!&#39;

|Yeah.. I&#39;m sure you got drunk and all. Are you telling me nothing 
happened that time when you were drunk?|

&#39;Yes! I passed out remember, I could here you singing while slurring 
lyrics to a number we were rehearsing for.&#39;

|Oh yeah..|

As the two parts of Kanna&#39;s began to argue as quietly as they could, 
the rusling of the sheets and bed began to slowly awake Maria from the 
most interesting dream of her redhead adding wipped cream to her most 
interesting parts.... she then saw her heart&#39;s desire next to her, the 
blonde slowly gave a seductive smile that made both Kanna and her 
brain frozen beyond the extent of there normal functions.

&quot;Hello there.. Kanna..&quot; while licking her lips in the the most 
sugestive manner that she could come up with.

A heart began going through cardio arrest

Kanna&#39;s brawn part began to panic and feel numb all over, this was the 
second time today that she had been very near a nude girl today. 
Kanna&#39;s brain part began to exite all over, this was the second time 
today that she had been very near a nude girl today also. both 
strugling for control of dominance for escape and for a good time, as 
Maria pinned the redhead and began to make the move...
