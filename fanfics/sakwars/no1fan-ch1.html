<h1>Sumire's No. 1 Fan</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../sakwars/index.html">Sakura Wars</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/oddimals.html">Oddimals</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	Sumire paced up and down the halls of the Teigeki Theatre, 
desperately searching for something quite dear to her. She looked 
under tables and inbetween cushions. Was it in the desk in the-- no, 
no, no... that&#39;s not where she left it. The bathroom? How foul! 
Perhaps behind the... nonsense, it would NOT be behind THAT.
	An hour passed. Then another. Soon three hours had passed 
without any trace of the missing item. Finally, the lovely Kanzaki 
entered the dining room and flopped very un-lady-like into a chair, 
resting her head on her arms face down on the table top.
	&quot;It is as though I have lost a piece of my soul!&quot; she cried in a 
muffled voice.  &quot;My poor little-- what is that smell?&quot;
	Sumire raised her head and pointed her nose in the direction of 
the kitchen. She grit her teeth at the sound of Kanna&#39;s singing. &quot;The 
beast is preparing a meal which, according to this dreadful aroma, is 
fit for ONLY a beast.&quot;
	The singing stopped as Kanna shuffled over to the kitchen door. 
&quot;Oi, Sumire! How&#39;s it goin&#39;?&quot;
	&quot;Don&#39;t patronize me, Ms. Kanna!&quot;
	Kanna shrugged. &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever... Hey, do you want 
some of the rice I made? It&#39;s smells great!&quot;
	Sumire replied with a snort.
	&quot;That just means more for me! It&#39;s one of my specialties, 
though, so it&#39;s a real shame to hafta eat it all by myself... Ouch 
ouch! Still hot! I should fan it down a couple&#39;a mor times...&quot;
	Eyes widening, Sumire jumped up from her seat and rushed over to 
the kitchen. Pushing past the giant woman, Sumire saw what she had 
feared...
	&quot;My my my MY FAN!!!&quot;
	&quot;Wha--?&quot;
	Sumire picked up her fan and faced Kanna. &quot;You oversized tree 
trunk! Just LOOK at what you&#39;ve done to my signature! This unique item 
which symbolizes me, the accessory of my persona... MY FAN WAS MY 
THING!&quot;
	Kanna gulped. &quot;Whoa, there, Sumire! It&#39;s just a fan! I mean, er, 
it&#39;s still good and all, right?&quot;
	Sumire opened her fan with a flick of her wrist and peered 
through the tiny holes in the paper. &quot;Yes, it would still work were it 
not for these burn holes! Let&#39;s see, who did this, who did this... Ms. 
Tree Trunk! You tank! You big stupid--&quot;
	&quot;I was just using it to cool the rice! I must&#39;ve left it on the 
burner... my special rice needs special care, Cactus Woman!&quot;
	Shaking with anger, Sumire threw the fan at Kanna&#39;s face. &quot;Do 
not EVER steal my things AGAIN, you barbarian! Thief!&quot;
	Kanna watched as Sumire stormed off. She looked down at the fan 
and sighed. &quot;Chyaa... I really blew it this time...&quot;

	Rehearsals that evening for The Crimson Lizard were a nightmare. 
Everyone fed off Sumire&#39;s angry energy, it seemed, as nobody wanted to 
work that day.
	&quot;Ogami-han, this is not working so well,&quot; whined Kohran, dressed 
as the Shonen Lad. &quot;Maybe we can finish this early, ya?&quot;
	Ichirou Ogami sighed. &quot;How does everyone feel about it?&quot;
	Masae, or rather Sakura dressed as Masae, stepped forward. 
&quot;Um... Ogami-san... perhaps this would be a good time to at the very 
least take a break...&quot; she shifted her gaze to Sumire, who had been 
unwilling to even put on her costume, let alone say the lines.&quot;
	&quot;We&#39;ve been on page five for over an hour!&quot; shouted Orihime from 
backstage. &quot;We are not so much the rehearsing, Taichou!&quot;
	Ogami closed his eyes and nodded. &quot;Very well... rehearsal will 
be moved to AFTER dinner. Sound good?&quot;
	Everyone looked at Sumire. She merely glared at Kanna and 
shrugged. &quot;Not that it matters to me... hmph!&quot;

	The Hanagumi grumbled to one another as they got undressed in 
the dressing room.
	Orihime pulled off her shoes and turned to her friend. &quot;What a 
strange rehearsal! Most strange indeed, ne, Kohran?&quot;
	The Chinese girl nodded. &quot;Quite, quite. Sumire-han refusing to 
rehearse without reason? She did not even wear her costume! Ya ya, 
most peculiar.&quot;
	&quot;Iris does not understand! What did we do?&quot; asked the little 
blonde.
	Kanna hung her suit up and sighed. &quot;I think it&#39;s my fault, you 
guys...&quot;
	Orihime coughed into her hand. &quot;What a surprise...&quot;
	&quot;It was a pretty safe assumption...&quot; began Maria. &quot;But she&#39;s 
been like this for some time now. What exactly did you do, Kanna?&quot;
	 The large red-head tied her headband across her forehead as she 
mumbled a confession. &quot;I kinda sorta took, um, her fan and set it on 
fire, a bit. But ya know it was just a little bit, and it still 
WORKS...&quot;
	Sakura gasped. &quot;Kanna! Sumire isn&#39;t Sumire without her fan! No 
wonder she hates you... again...&quot;
	The others agreed by nodding their heads. There came a knock at 
the door, and seeing how everyone was dressed, Reni answered. 
&quot;Taichou, welcome.&quot;
	Ogami smiled. &quot;Hello, girls... um, about today... did I do 
anything wrong?&quot;
	Iris started to tell him it was a personal matter between Kanna 
and Sumire, but Orihime pushed her way forward. &quot;Yes yes, Japanese 
male! Your fault, your fault! Treating us to the cinema might make up 
for it, however.&quot;
	He laughed. &quot;Oh, really? You guys think that will make 
rehearsals tonight go better?&quot;
	&quot;Iris wants to go to the park!&quot;
	&quot;Can we get snacks?&quot;
	&quot;Ramune pleeease!?&quot;
	The girls followed Ogami out the door, gleefully discussing what 
movies were available. Sakura, however, turned to Kanna and asked 
&quot;Don&#39;t you want to come?&quot;
	Kanna&#39;s eyes sparkled at the idea of playing in the park and 
seeing a movie, but in the end decided she should stay home.
	&quot;What about Sumire?&quot; asked Sakura.
	&quot;I don&#39;t think she wants to come...&quot; said Iris.
	The others agreed and left Kanna to finish tidying up the 
dressing room, which she did in a less than energetic mode.

	Sumire had left rehearsals immediately, climbed the stairs and 
swung into her room, slamming the door behind. She hadn&#39;t gotten into 
costume that day, so she comfortably fell onto her soft bed. &quot;That 
Kanna... look what she&#39;s doing to me!&quot;
	She rolled over onto her back and looked up at the ceiling. 
&quot;Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t have caused the others such grief during 
rehearsals... but how is a top star supposed to perform alongside that 
freak show?!&quot;
	No one answered, of course. She sat up, pulled off her clothes, 
and grabbed her softest robe and a few towels. &quot;A warm shower will 
calm my nerves. Oh, I shall miss my beloved fan...&quot;
	With that, Sumire sauntered down the stairs and headed for the 
showers.

	The warm water splashed down upon her naked body. She smiled 
sweetly. &quot;A truly deserved break...&quot;
	Not that she&#39;d been working all that hard, but losing her fan 
had caused her enough stress to last a month. She could easily afford 
a new one, but that was not the issue; Kanna had pushed her final 
button. She knew she wasn&#39;t overly friendly, but at the same time she 
knew she got along with each of the Hanagumi members, to some degree, 
minus Kanna. There had been times when the two had come through for 
each other, but the majority of their days were spent bickering and 
calling the other names. It had been that way since the beginning. 
Things don&#39;t change, she thought, but then again... &quot;Sakura and I are 
not altogether unfriendly anymore. But... what is it about that woman? 
Kanna, Kanna, Kanna...&quot;
	Sumire heard some sounds from the locker area as she lathered 
her hair. She figured the other girls were about ready to wash out the 
make-up and sweat. The joys of theatre work.
	&quot;Oi, Sumire...&quot;
	Sumire&#39;s eyes flashed as she turned and saw Kanna. She quickly 
turned back to face the shower handles. Why must SHE be here, she 
thought.
	Kanna hung the towel she&#39;d used to cover her waist on a nearby 
rack and walked back over to turn the water on. Liquid sprayed out as 
she closed her eyes. She had decided not to be unkind to Sumire for a 
while, at least until she had cooled off a bit. She didn&#39;t exactly 
have a way with words, so she felt saying nothing would be better than 
trying to apologize and end up digging a deeper hole. So she chose to 
keep to herself.
	Sumire stared at the wall. She could feel herself wanting to 
cover her privates, feeling as though Kanna were an intrusion. She was 
certainly intimidating! That was a LOT of naked muscle-bound female 
not four feet away, and Sumire didn&#39;t want to see any of that. So in 
an effort to avoid seeing giant naked girl, Sumire blindly sought the 
soap bar with her hand.
	&quot;What&#39;cha lookin&#39; for, Sumire?&quot;
	She did not respond.
	&quot;Oh, I see. Here.&quot;
	Sumire gulped. Her smooth and delicate hand had been wrapped 
with tan fingers. Slowly, she rotated her head and saw Kanna gently 
guiding her hand to the soap dish. She shut her eyes and grabbed the 
soap, trying to turn back to her shower without catching a full 
glimpse of Kanna. Unfortunately, the soap had slipped from her grasp 
and fell to the tiles below.
	&quot;Kinda hard to see in this mist, ya know?&quot; said Kanna as she 
turned off the water. She always took quick showers. &quot;I guess I run 
the water too hot. It&#39;s bad for the skin, I know, but it feels so good 
when you&#39;re all sore and stuff.&quot;
	Sumire glowered at the soap on the floor. She didn&#39;t want to 
face Kanna, so she decided to wait until the larger woman had left 
before reaching down. Suddenly, Sumire&#39;s eyes widened as Kanna turned 
and stepped on the soap.
	&quot;Yep, so you can see why I--yaaiiiiii!&quot;
	The water on Sumire&#39;s side continued to flow as she stood naked, 
looking down at the sprawled figure on the floor. Kanna had slipped 
and hit her head. She&#39;d be okay-- after all, this was Kanna, but for 
now she lie unconscious on the drain. Sumire gulped. If she hadn&#39;t 
seemed imposing before, Kanna was certainly seeming that way now. 
Kanna had not wrapped herself with a towel yet, and so Sumire had a 
good view of everything the woman had to offer... ginormous breasts.
	&quot;Good God, those are HUGE!&quot; gasped Sumire. She&#39;d never seen 
Kanna&#39;s full chest before as she had never faced anyone in the 
dressing room, and certainly not Kanna. She thought she&#39;d be repulsed, 
but Sumire found herself quite fascinated. &quot;I thought mine were a 
decent size, but how can they compare to the plump watermelons on the 
Tree Trunk Woman? So large... so large...&quot;
	Sumire shook her head as she realized what she was doing. &quot;Like 
some sort of common spectator, I am oggling another woman&#39;s breasts! 
They&#39;re just breasts, Sumire. Just breasts. So let&#39;s return to our 
room now... and not look at them anymore...&quot;
	Though the great big boobies beckoned her to continue, Sumire 
cut the show short and grabbed her robe after turning off the water. 
&quot;She&#39;ll wake up in a minute or two... and I don&#39;t think I should touch 
her... I mean, move her... not that I could...&quot; She continued to 
mutter as she tied her robe and walked out of the bathing area into 
the hallway.

	The door opened and closed to Sumire&#39;s room; she stood by her 
door with a bemused expression. She had just admired Kanna&#39;s breasts, 
of all things... &quot;Wait, what&#39;s this here?&quot;
	She walked over to her bed and picked up a box. &quot;For me? From a 
fan, perhaps...&quot;
	The ribbon untied as she pulled off the lid. Cocking her head to 
the side, Sumire studied the gift with an uncertain look on her face. 
&quot;What in the--?&quot;
	Inside was a giant fan with the words &quot;Sumire&#39;s No. 1 Fan!&quot; 
painted on the paper. She held it up and noticed a small note 
fluttering out of the box. She took the paper and brought it up to her 
face, for the handwriting was sloppy and needed close inspection. &quot;&#39;To 
Sumire... sorry I&#39;m dumb. Kanna...&#39;&quot;
	&quot;I know it&#39;s not as nice as your old one, but I thought, well, 
since I know your performances better than anyone else...&quot;
	Sumire looked up and saw Kanna standing in the doorway. She was 
rubbing her head and wearing a scruffy old bathrobe. &quot;It also kinda 
had double meaning, see? I found it in the shop, and Tsubaki let me 
buy it for cheap, since I have no money. It says it&#39;s your fan, and 
fan is another... well, yeah. You get it. So again, um, I&#39;m sorry I 
killed your old fan.&quot;
	Blinking, Sumire looked at the fan once more. She giggled softly 
to herself, surprising Kanna.
	&quot;Ah, c&#39;mon, don&#39;t laugh!&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Kanna,&quot; smiled Sumire. &quot;It is a very sweet gesture, 
but are you implying you admire my work?&quot;
	Kanna blushed, scratching her nose lightly. &quot;Well, I mean... 
that is... we&#39;ve been working in most plays as lovers or partners or 
whatever. We always seem to get paired up, ya know? I&#39;ve noticed ya, 
and ya know what? You&#39;re pretty good! And I kinda like workin&#39; with 
ya, so I guess I... well yeah, I am a fan of your work. Not always of 
your personality...&quot;
	Realizing what she had said, Kanna tried to take it back. But 
Sumire smiled, sat down on her bed, and started to fan herself. &quot;Ms. 
Kanna... I&#39;m afraid I must admit... rehearsing with you is always a 
burden for me, but performing with an audience next to you is... it&#39;s 
refreshing.&quot;
	&quot;Eh? Ya mean it?&quot;
	&quot;Oh yes! On stage you suddenly become a whole new person! You&#39;re 
a wonderful actress, Kanna. I myself often wonder if maybe you aren&#39;t 
really my rival, my fiancee, my love...&quot;
	Kanna was shocked. She&#39;d picked out the nicest fan she could 
afford in hopes of replacing the old one, but she didn&#39;t think Sumire 
would forgive her like this! And COMPLIMENTING her! &quot;I think I may 
have hit my head a bit harder than I thought...&quot;
	Sumire&#39;s face suddenly filled with concern. &quot;Oh yes! I left you 
down there after that horrible spill! And it was all my fault... can 
you forgive me?&quot;
	Now she KNEW she must&#39;ve caused some brain damage. Was Sumire 
asking for FORGIVENESS?
	The Top Star of Japan scooted over and pat the bed beside her. 
&quot;Come, come, come! Sit next to me so I can look at your head. I hope 
it&#39;s not bleeding...&quot;
	Not wanting to let an opportunity like this pass, Kanna closed 
the door and walked over to the bed. She sat down and was immediately 
being cared for by a now tender Sumire. &quot;Thank goodness! It&#39;s only a 
bump. You&#39;ll be fine.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, I figured that much...&quot;
	&quot;Do you need anything, though? I do feel awful.&quot;
	&quot;The gift wasn&#39;t THAT nice, Sumire...&quot;
	Sumire couldn&#39;t explain it either, but she suddenly felt 
compelled to nurse Kanna. &quot;Here, now, you said you had been working 
out, right?&quot;
	&quot;No, what I said was--&quot;
	&quot;So you must be sore! Let me massage your muscles, Kanna! I&#39;m 
quite good with my hands.&quot;
	Blink blink. And now she was offering to be her own personal 
masseuse? &quot;Sumire, you&#39;re full of surprises today.&quot;
	And so are you, thought Sumire.
	Kanna turned over and lay belly down on Sumire&#39;s soft bed. 
Sumire scooted over and began kneading Kanna&#39;s shoulders. &quot;How&#39;s 
this?&quot;
	The older woman hadn&#39;t strained herself that day physically, but 
she was still quite tight from a previous work-out the day before. And 
Sumire was quite right about her hands. &quot;This is niiiiiiice! Thanks a 
lot, Sumire! Ooh, right there! Yeah, that&#39;s the spot.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m afraid I hardly know what I&#39;m touching. This old robe of 
yours keeps bunching up.&quot;
	&quot;Don&#39;t insult the robe.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m not... I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s in the way.&quot;
	&quot;So, what, you want me to take it off?&quot;
	&quot;Well... okay.&quot;
	Kanna froze. &quot;Wait, you don&#39;t mind? I would be naked on YOUR 
bed. NAKED. Won&#39;t ya just get pissed off? I mean, I might contaminate 
it, or whatever.&quot;
	The younger girl laughed. &quot;Oh, nonsense. I&#39;m asking you to 
accept this as my apology for the way I&#39;ve been treating you recently. 
You can take this also as a thank you for your kind words.&quot;
	&quot;Ya mean it?&quot;
	&quot;Yes.&quot;
	&quot;Ya won&#39;t get mad?&quot;
	&quot;I won&#39;t.&quot;
	&quot;Okay...&quot;
	And with that, Kanna hesitantly undid her robe (still lying on 
her stomach) and allowed Sumire to gently slide the back down. Kanna&#39;s 
back was very muscular, and from Sumire&#39;s position, she thought she 
could easily confuse Kanna for a man. Sumire rolled up her sleeves and 
went to work, kneading her fists into the other&#39;s shoulders.
	&quot;Ms. Kanna, you&#39;re so tense!&quot; smiled Sumire. &quot;Please try to 
relax!&quot;
	//How can I relax with a Cactus Woman grinding at my back?// 
thought Kanna. //Although... she&#39;s being pretty nice to me... maybe I 
should just... you know, that ain&#39;t bad... AH! That&#39;s the spot, that&#39;s 
the spot!&quot;
	&quot;Saaaa... you ARE good at this!&quot; sighed Kanna.
	Sumire grinned. &quot;I&#39;m good at everything I do, Ms. Kanna!&quot;
	//Damn, she&#39;s strong!&quot; thought Sumire. &quot;I need to put more force 
into this. She&#39;s so tight all over! I wonder how much she can lift... 
But it must be terrible... being female and so masculine... I 
wonder... if...//
	&quot;Kanna, if you don&#39;t mind me asking... have you ever been with a 
man?&quot;
	Kanna scrunched up her face. &quot;Hmmm... you mean other than the 
Taichou?&quot;
	&quot;EEEEEH?????&quot;
	She turned her head a little to be able to see Sumire, who was 
in shock. &quot;I&#39;m with him all the time! We train together. He&#39;s pretty 
much the only one here I can really train with since all you guys are 
so, well, weak. I guess Maria and I sometimes work out together, or at 
least we used to... but she&#39;s not so much into what I&#39;m into.&quot;
	A sigh of relief left Sumire&#39;s lips. &quot;Ms. Kanna, don&#39;t scare me 
like that!&quot;
	&quot;What?&quot;
	&quot;I thought you were saying you and Shoui had, you know... slept 
together.&quot;
	&quot;Eh?&quot;
	&quot;Made... love?&quot;
	&quot;OH!&quot; Kanna blushed. Feeling a bit ashamed, she laughed &quot;Of 
course that&#39;s what you meant! I guess I am kinda a knucklehead at 
times.&quot;
	&quot;So then,&quot; continued Sumire. &quot;The answer is no, correct?&quot;
	&quot;Y... yeah...&quot;
	Sumire nodded. //As it should be,// she thought. //Although... 
she really is a big sweetheart, isn&#39;t she? A bit on the juvenile side, 
but some men like that in a woman. //
	&quot;How about you? Oooooh... that feels nice! My upper back-- 
that&#39;s the stuff!&quot;
	&quot;M-me???&quot; Sumire stopped massaging Kanna&#39;s neck. &quot;That&#39;s a 
personal question! A top star like myself has men flocking to her door 
nightly!&quot;
	&quot;So then, you have?&quot;
	&quot;Um... that is... not so much...&quot;
	Kanna pounded the bed as she laughed. &quot;Asking me that when 
you&#39;ve never done it either!&quot;
	&quot;Sh-shut up!&quot; Sumire said, folding her arms across her chest as 
if to hide herself. &quot;What business is it of yours to--&quot;
	&quot;Na, Sumire...&quot; Sumire hushed when she caught Kanna&#39;s violet 
gaze. &quot;It&#39;s pretty easy for us to get into a fight. We&#39;re not so 
different, though.&quot;
	&quot;Well, I suppose you&#39;re right...&quot;
	&quot;&#39;Course I am! I wonder how many of the other girls are 
virgins.&quot;
	&quot;I often wonder about Ms. Sakura, myself.&quot;
	Kanna glared at her. &quot;Riiiight...&quot; A smile crept onto Kanna&#39;s 
face. &quot;Heh, just between you and me... you know who ISN&#39;T?&quot;
	Sumire leaned closer. &quot;Who? Who?&quot;
	&quot;Maria.&quot;
	&quot;EEEH? Really?&quot;
	&quot;Of course, it was before she joined us. But yeah, she used to 
be a very active soldier girl.&quot;
	Sumire covered her mouth with her hand to hide her smile. &quot;I 
suppose it makes sense. After all, she was in an army with so many 
men... My, Kanna. That&#39;s quite a secret! But why did you share it with 
me?&quot;
	Shrugging, Kanna said &quot;Aw, I don&#39;t know. But you&#39;re being so 
nice to me, I just kinda felt like sharing something with ya.&quot;
	&quot;Oh... I see.&quot;
	Kanna turned her head forward so that Sumire was now facing the 
backside of Kanna&#39;s red hair. She had almost forgotten she was 
supposed to be rubbing Kanna, so she quickly returned to her work. She 
slid her fingertips down to the small of her back and used her thumbs 
to massage the area. She stopped when she heard Kanna moan softly, 
quivering just slightly.
	&quot;Kanna? Are you okay?&quot;
	&quot;Er, um... it feels really nice.&quot;
	&quot;You moaned.&quot;
	&quot;I said it was nice!&quot;
	&quot;Okay.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s just...&quot; Kanna buried her head deeper into her arms. &quot;You 
got kinda low there.&quot;
	Sumire blinked. &quot;Do you not want me to touch this area? It&#39;s 
just your back.&quot;
	&quot;Well, you know... heh heh, nevermind. It feels great! That area 
always hurts.&quot;
	Sumire continued, now using her knuckles to pop Kanna&#39;s back. 
&quot;It&#39;s probably because you have such large breasts, Ms. Kanna.&quot;
	&quot;S-Sumire!&quot;
	&quot;What? We&#39;re both women. We can talk about breasts.&quot;
	&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean-- I mean, why do we gotta talk about 
breasts?&quot;
	A wicked grin curled Sumire&#39;s lips. &quot;Oh, does this embarrass 
you?&quot;
	&quot;N-No!&quot;
	&quot;That&#39;s good. I&#39;m glad that you aren&#39;t ashamed of your own 
breasts. After all, I got a good glimpse of them today while you were 
sleeping on the bathroom floor.&quot;
	Kanna looked over. Her face was bright red and she looked a bit 
panicked. &quot;You WHAT?&quot;
	&quot;Ohohohohohoho! Ms. Kanna, you have nothing to be ashamed of! 
Such large breasts are something women would kill for! Not me, of 
course. My breasts are perfect.&quot;
	&quot;I can&#39;t believe you saw my boobs!&quot;
	&quot;Believe it!&quot;
	&quot;I didn&#39;t know you were gay!&quot;
	&quot;Believe-- WHAT???&quot;
	Kanna sat up, keeping her robe pulled up over her chest. &quot;That 
explains things! Looking at my boobs, touching my butt--&quot;
	&quot;Your lower BACK!&quot;
	&quot;No wonder you&#39;ve been so nice to me recently! I gotta say, 
Sumire, I misjudged ya!&quot;
	Sumire slammed her fists into the bed. &quot;I am NOT a lesbian!&quot;
	&quot;Things don&#39;t have to be different between us. You&#39;re still a 
cactus woman to me.&quot;
	Filled with rage, Sumire grabbed a pillow and prepared to 
smother Kanna. She jumped forward, slamming the pillow into Kanna&#39;s 
face... and sending them both over the edge...
	Of the bed.
	Thud! Kanna and Sumire slammed into the floor. Sumire had landed 
on the pillows on top of Kanna. //These are awfully warm pillows...// 
She gulped. Slowly, she opened one eye. She was face to face with 
something tan, round, and attached to Kanna&#39;s left breast.
	&quot;OHMIGODMYFACEISONYOURTIT!!!!!!&quot; cried Sumire. She scrambled to 
sit up, but she kept sliding back into Kanna&#39;s breasts. She rolled 
over and fell onto the floor next to Kanna.
	Silence fell as the two lay motionless. Sumire heard nothing but 
her own heart beating as she turned her head to look at Kanna. Kanna 
was staring at the ceiling, her face flushed. Sumire turned back and 
stared at Kanna&#39;s legs, which were still on the bed a little.
	Finally, one of them spoke. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Sumire.&quot;
	&quot;For what?&quot;
	Kanna looked at Sumire, her face reddening. &quot;That you... that 
you had to... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
	Sumire began to blush slightly. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s not your fault. I 
mean, how clumsy was it of me to push you off the bed only to go 
crashing with you? I&#39;m afraid I have to apologize.&quot;
	&quot;........&quot;
	&quot;Ms. Kanna?&quot;
	The other gulped. She slowly put her hands up to close her robe 
over her chest. &quot;I&#39;ve just, um, never been touched there before. By 
anyone else, of course.&quot;
	&quot;Oh... I see.&quot;
	&quot;Um... so, uh, you&#39;re not gay, are you?&quot;
	&quot;Not really, no.&quot;
	&quot;Oh...&quot;
	Sumire noticed that Kanna seemed a bit disappointed. &quot;Would you 
like me to be?&quot;
	Kanna shot up and crawled clumsily onto the bed. She laughed 
loudly. &quot;Um, no! Ha ha ha! That is, well...&quot;
	Sumire stood and sat down next to Kanna. &quot;Yes?&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s just... I kinda got a little excited, actually.&quot;
	Sumire&#39;s heart skipped a beat. &quot;Oh?&quot;
	&quot;You see,&quot; Kanna hung her head. &quot;Nobody&#39;s ever liked me that way 
before. So uh, I kinda got a little excited that someone had finally, 
um, noticed me. Heh, pretty stupid of me, huh?&quot;
	For once, Sumire didn&#39;t know what to say. She had figured nobody 
had shown interest in such a masculine woman, but she didn&#39;t really 
think Kanna cared. She seemed to enjoy being care-free and macho girl, 
training with the Shoui and never chasing after him romantically like 
some of the others did. Seeing Kanna hurting like this, Sumire felt 
compelled to do something.
	After a few moments of thought, Sumire sighed to herself and 
thought //Think of this as another performance by Japan&#39;s finest 
star...//
	Kanna felt her head being lifted by soft hands. She looked up 
and saw Sumire holding her gently, smiling to her the warmest smile 
she&#39;d ever seen. &quot;Sumire...?&quot;
	&quot;Shhh...&quot; she said, putting a finger to Kanna&#39;s lips. &quot;I want 
you to know what you really mean to me. It&#39;s a secret, though, so 
don&#39;t tell anyone...&quot;
	With that, Sumire leaned forward and delicately kissed Kanna&#39;s 
lips. Kanna&#39;s eyes widened even more when Sumire wrapped her arms 
around her body and pushed her back, laying her down.
	Kanna wasn&#39;t sure if Sumire was for real or not. Perhaps this 
was some sort of joke? She suddenly felt Sumire&#39;s tongue part her lips 
and enter her mouth. Kanna closed her eyes at last, when she felt her 
robe slowly being pulled off. She decided to enjoy it.
	Sumire pulled away from Kanna&#39;s soft lips to look into her eyes. 
There was a somewhat frightened look in them; Sumire could tell Kanna 
was unsure about her, but she could also tell she was enjoying it. She 
was surprised to notice her own heart was racing... perhaps she was 
enjoying it herself. She sat back on her knees and admired Kanna&#39;s 
body. Strong, athletic... but she was certainly a woman; the large 
breasts and slim waist gave it all away. In fact, Sumire had never 
noticed how much smaller Kanna&#39;s waist was in comparison to the rest 
of her.
	&quot;My, Kanna... where does all that food go?&quot; 
	Kanna smiled and pointed to her breasts.
	Sumire giggled. &quot;I see... well, I don&#39;t eat as much as you do, 
so mine are only a fraction of the size of yours.&quot;
	She blushed slightly as she undid her robe and allowed the silky 
fabric to slide off her body. A chill ran over her flesh and she 
shivered.
	&quot;Such a lovely body...&quot; admired Kanna. &quot;I&#39;ve noticed it before, 
though. You show it off quite well.&quot; Though Kanna said this, still, 
she was actually quite impressed. Although she knew Sumire had a nice 
figure, she didn&#39;t know a woman could look so beautiful undressed.
	&quot;It&#39;s soft, too,&quot; cooed Sumire. She took hold of Kanna&#39;s hand 
and brought it to her own chest, allowing the other to cup her left 
breast. &quot;Isn&#39;t it?&quot;
	Kanna gulped, nodding. Sumire let go of her hand, but Kanna kept 
it on her breast. The truth was, it was VERY SOFT, and Kanna didn&#39;t 
want to let go. Mustering some courage, Kanna decided to give it a 
soft squeeze. Sumire let her head fall back as her lover gently played 
with her breast. She gasped when Kanna gave the nipple a quick pinch.
	&quot;Kanna!&quot; she squealed. She lifted her head and quickly covered 
her nipple with her hands. But she had to smile when she saw the 
expression Kanna wore. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t look that way... I was just 
surprised, that&#39;s all.&quot;
	She leaned forward and kissed the groove between Kanna&#39;s 
breasts. Like a valley between two mountains, she thought. She took 
hold of the large mounds and gently kneaded them with her hands. Kanna 
moaned softly, encouraging Sumire to continue. But instead, Sumire 
took a nipple into her mouth and gently sucked. Kanna&#39;s breathing 
momentarily stopped. &quot;You like?&quot;
	Kanna responded by nodding shakily.
	Sumire continued by circling the tan bump with her tongue, 
slowly, before taking it in once more. She lightly flicked it with her 
tongue, while using her other hand to play with the other nipple. 
Kanna squirmed a little with pleasure, and so Sumire squeezed a little 
harder.
	&quot;Sumire... that feels wonderful!&quot;
	She stopped to look up. She grinned before moving closer to kiss 
Kanna; this time the kiss was returned. She lightly licked Kanna&#39;s 
bottom lip within the kiss  before pulling away and moving down to 
Kanna&#39;s thighs, which were very well defined. &quot;This, Kanna, will feel 
even more wonderful.&quot;
	Sumire gently kissed Kanna&#39;s inner thigh, causing the larger 
girl to shiver. She slowly dragged her tongue along the inside until 
she reached the other&#39;s crotch. She  had not expected to go this far, 
but Sumire could not stop herself. She was enjoying pleasuring her 
former enemy, though really they had never truly hated each other. She 
knew it, though she never understood why she treated her the way she 
did.
	Kanna held her breath when she felt a small, cool wind blow 
inbetween her pussy lips. &quot;Sumire! Don&#39;t tease me, okay?&quot;
	The other responded by parting her pussy with her tongue. This 
caused Kanna to moan, and Sumire continued. She pushed apart her 
strong legs and held the lips open with her thumbs, giving her a good 
look at Kanna&#39;s pussy. It was slightly moist,  she noticed, and had 
probably never been this way before. She stifled a quiet laugh, 
reminding herself what she was about to do.
	Sumire found Kanna&#39;s clit and kissed it, causing a small jerk in 
Kanna. She then licked it, swirling over it with her tongue and every 
once in a while suckling it. She slid down to her opening, teased it, 
and then went back up to the clit. Kanna&#39;s breathing had quickened 
now. She then slipped a finger into her lover&#39;s hole, which was not 
protected by a hymen, she noticed. //Probably from all those kicks... 
I&#39;m not surprised it ripped.//
	Kanna closed her eyes. This feeling was very new to her; she had 
never masturbated or ever really thought about sex before. She felt 
confused, but loved it. Sumire wasn&#39;t just good with her hands.
	Sumire used her fingers to play with Kanna&#39;s clit, tugging and 
rubbing it vigorously while she prodded the vagina with her tongue. 
She could now taste her juices, which were saltier than expected. She 
quickly got used to the strong taste and aroma and just enjoyed the 
sounds of Kanna&#39;s panting. She knew the other girl wouldn&#39;t last long.
	Sumire&#39;s skilled tongue lapped hungrily at Kanna&#39;s pussy, 
sliding in and out of her vagina and flicking across her hard 
clitoris.
	&quot;I don&#39;t think I can last much longer, Sumire!&quot; panted Kanna.
	Sumire viciously sucked at the clit while rubbing the inside of 
Kanna&#39;s vagina, using her free hand to reach up and squeeze one of her 
large breasts. This was all Kanna could take; she arched her back and 
gasped. The muscles around Sumire&#39;s fingers tightened, and she could 
feel a great warmth incase her hand. Her lover relaxed, and Sumire sat 
back on her knees once more. She stared at her soaked hand and smiled.
	She turned to grab a tissue when Sumire was suddenly pulled down 
by large arms. She lay next to Kanna, wrapped in her muscular limbs, 
and waited.
	Finally, Kanna opened her eyes and looked down at Sumire, whom 
she was  hugging firmly to her chest. &quot;Thank you, Sumire.&quot;
	Sumire blushed and turned away, Kanna&#39;s hands still wrapped 
around her waist and chest. &quot;I thought I was thanking you, today.&quot;
	&quot;Heh, do I have to buy you another fan?&quot;
	She laughed. &quot;Actually, let&#39;s you and I go shopping together for 
a new one tomorrow. Not that yours isn&#39;t exceptional, of course...&quot;
	&quot;I understand,&quot; laughed Kanna.
	&quot;I&#39;ll pay for it, so money&#39;s not an issue. What do you say, Ms. 
Kanna?&quot;
	&quot;Sounds good to me. It&#39;s a date.&quot;
	Sumire coughed. &quot;Date?! What are you implying?!&quot; There was no 
fighting, though, as Kanna had snuggled into Sumire and was starting 
to drift off to sleep. She smiled as she closed her eyes. &quot;If the 
others come back and find us like this, I might have to show you my 
Kanzaki Rising Wind technique.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;ve always been a fan of your techniques. I&#39;m willing to risk 
it.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m glad you are.&quot;
	With that, the newfound lovers lay peacefully together on the 
soft mattress in the Kanzaki bedroom, wondering if perhaps this was 
the start of a new beginning.

	In the evening when the others returned, everyone wondered why 
Kanna and Sumire suddenly had a lot to smile about. Rehearsals went 
smoother than they had ever, thanks to Sumire&#39;s sudden enthusiasm. The 
biggest mystery, however, was the sudden appearance of an atrocious 
looking giant fan, which Sumire carried with her at all times.	</pre>
