<h1>Never Again</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/forever3330.html">Forever3330</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	&#147;Megumi-chan, you have got to be spinning me a tale. And I won&#146;t 
fall for it!&#148; The blonde huffed, flipping her hair behind her ear.
	&#147;I&#146;m not lying Suzuni-chan!&#148; The brunette insisted, pushing her 
glasses up her nose absently with one finger. &#147;There&#146;s a beautiful 
girl who comes here everyday, and just sits at the gate where the only 
flight from Hong Kong to Tomoeda is. Every single day she sits and 
watches all the people get off the plane, and watches the new people 
get on. Then she comes over here and orders a scoop of strawberry 
ice-cream with one cherry.&#148; Megumi was a worker at the small ice cream 
shop across from of the gate.
	Megumi&#146;s girlfriend raised an eyebrow, calming down. &#147;Look, I 
came here to watch you work, not to hear tales.&#148;
	&#147;Just wait!&#148; Megumi scolded. &#147;The only flight that arrives here 
comes in at exactly noon. She&#146;ll be here in about ten minutes, with 
half an hour till noon. She&#146;ll leave when the only flight that departs 
leaves at exactly one.&#148;
	Suzuni sighed. &#147;Daijoubu, daijoubu&#133;we&#146;ll wait and see. How about 
you give me a Chocolate Sunday while we wait?&#148;
	&#147;You and chocolate&#133;&#148; Megumi rolled her eyes, bringing one over.
	&#147;Be nice!&#148; Suzuni bopped her girlfriend lightly on the head, 
then started eating her ice cream.
	After serving Suzuni, Megumi leaned against the counter, sighing 
as if she were in dreamland. &#147;She&#146;s not just a beautiful girl, either. 
She&#146;s gorgeous! And so graceful&#133;she has a melodious voice, it&#146;s so 
pretty. She kind of reminds me of an angel.&#148;
	&#147;Watch how you talk about her or I&#146;ll get mad!&#148; Suzuni said with 
a warning glare.
	&#147;What, jealous?&#148; Megumi teased.
	&#147;What do you think, you baka?&#148; Suzuni replied.
	&#147;There she is!&#148; Megumi exclaimed softly, nodding down the hall 
leading up to the gate.
	Suzuni turned and gaped, for once ignoring her ice cream and 
letting it slowly melt.
	The girl looked like she was around the age of twenty, with 
violet-black curls falling in waves to her waist. Her skin was so pale 
Suzuni thought that she could be a ghost. Pale lips were curved up 
slightly, in an almost hopeful manner. Stormy blue eyes looked out 
calmly, scanning the people around her to find a seat near the gate.
	&#147;She IS beautiful&#133;&#148; Suzuni managed.
	&#147;Look more closely at the eyes.&#148; Megumi instructed.
	Suzuni obeyed, and was surprised to see the well of emotions 
that could be seen behind them, if you ignored the mask the girl&#146;s 
eyes seemed to have. There was the tiniest bit of hope, and there was 
despair. Calmness, patience, and most of all&#133;sadness. Loneliness.
	Megumi examined Suzuni&#146;s face closely. &#147;As I&#146;ve always told you 
before&#133;the eyes are the windows to the soul.&#148;
	Suzuni sighed and turned back to Megumi, leaving the graceful 
figure, clothed in a sleeveless white sundress with a sunflower pinned 
to the left strap, behind to sit down. &#147;You&#146;re right&#133;I wonder what 
could make someone that sad?&#148;
	Megumi sighed, smiling a sad sort of smile. &#147;I don&#146;t know&#133;I 
always feel that I should be&#133;I don&#146;t know, respectful or something. I 
can never make myself ask when I look into those eyes. It&#146;s almost as 
if she&#146;s been through a million battles. And the sad thing is, she 
probably has.&#148;
	&#147;At her age? She&#146;s been at war?&#148; Suzuni looked confused.
	Megumi sweatdropped. &#147;Not THAT kind of fighting! I mean it looks 
as if she&#146;s had a hard life.&#148;
	&#147;Oh. I knew that!&#148; Suzuni tried.
	&#147;Yeah, right.&#148; Megumi rolled her eyes. &#147;If you&#146;re so curious you 
try and ask her. I need to go and sweep the floor&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Maybe I will!&#148; Suzuni said, standing and walking off before 
Megumi could stop her.
	&#147;She didn&#146;t even finish her ice-cream&#133;?&#148; Megumi shrugged and 
started to clean up.
~
	Tomoyo sat down gracefully in the middle of an empty row right 
by the gate. She had once promised herself she would wait for Sakura 
to return to her every day until the end of her time. It had been 
perhaps two years since her light had left her, taking away most of 
Tomoyo&#146;s happiness. There was still the small joy she could get from 
watching her Sakura tapes and designing new outfits that the other 
girl would probably never try on.
	Okaa-san worried greatly about her nowadays, but Tomoyo kept 
going about her normal schedule. Or what had become normal after she 
had pulled herself together after Sakura&#146;s departure. Tomoyo still 
hadn&#146;t managed to watch the tape of Sakura&#146;s wedding&#133;she somehow 
couldn&#146;t force herself to. She simply designed things for Okaa-san&#146;s 
company, and designed even more things for Sakura, which she kept 
locked away in her bedroom.
	Tomoyo looked up, shaken out of her Sakura-reverie as someone 
cleared his or her throat.
	A tall blonde girl, probably sixteen or so, though she was 
taller then Tomoyo since the heiress had always been rather petite, 
stood before her. She had her hair cut short, almost in a way that 
reminded Tomoyo of Sakura, and had hazel eyes that were full of 
curiosity. The girl was clothed in jeans and a shirt, and tilted her 
head gently to the side. &#147;Ohayo! I&#146;m Kajiya Suzuni!&#148; Suzuni bowed 
politely. &#147;Well&#133;I will be. Oh, just call me Suzuni!&#148;
	Tomoyo smiled slightly at the girl&#146;s enthusiasm. So much like 
Sakura&#146;s when she was young! &#147;I&#146;m Daidouji-san.&#148; Tomoyo offered, 
nodding her head gravely since she didn&#146;t feel like standing while 
waiting for the plane as she always did, and also not giving out her 
first name.
	&#147;Pardon me for intruding upon you,&#148; Suzuni blushed, ducking her 
head and then lifting it. &#147;But Megumi-chan, a girl who works at the 
ice-cream shop across from here, told me about you a while ago. She 
said you come here every single day to watch the people who get on and 
off of this exact flight.&#148; Suzuni looked more curious then embarrassed 
now. &#147;And I wondered why. And also why you look so sad&#133;&#148;
	&#147;You think I&#146;m sad?&#148; Tomoyo was mildly surprised. Very rarely 
could people see through the masks that she wore to hide her feelings.
	&#147;I didn&#146;t at first, but my girlfriend Megumi is always picking 
up on things like that. She&#146;s so perceptive!&#148; Tomoyo had to let out a 
small giggle as she saw the hearts in Suzuni&#146;s eyes.
	&#147;Well, if you sit down I can tell you.&#148; Tomoyo offered, the 
words barely out of her mouth before Suzuni eagerly sat down. Tomoyo 
smiled serenely, clasping her hands in her lap. &#147;Once upon a time, 
around twelve years ago, there was a young girl who moved here, to 
Tomoeda. She was so scared when she walked into her new classroom, and 
thought she wouldn&#146;t make any friends. She wasn&#146;t very good at making 
friends back then. But by a chance of fate she got seated next to a 
kawaii, genki, energetic young girl who was always smiling and happy.&#148; 
Tomoyo sighed her &#145;hanyaa&#146; sigh. &#147;When the genki young girl saw the 
new girl had no eraser, she cheerfully handed over a bunny eraser, 
telling the new girl her name as she did. That kawaii little girl had 
the most beautiful name: Sakura. So Sakura-chan became friends with 
the formerly lonely Tomoyo-chan. They grew up together, Tomoyo-chan 
always following Sakura around with a camcorder or camera, capturing 
every moment she could of Sakura&#146;s kawaii and magical life.&#148;
	&#147;I wish I could do that with Suzuni&#133;&#148; Both Tomoyo and Suzuni 
jumped, noticing for the first time Megumi, who immediately blushed 
and sat on the other side of Tomoyo. &#147;Gomen. I&#146;m Kajiya Megumi. Go on! 
Onegai?&#148;
	Tomoyo smiled, noting that this girl must be Suzuni&#146;s 
girlfriend. &#147;Daijoubu. Every moment of Tomoyo-chan&#146;s life after she 
received that eraser was a big &#145;I love you Sakura-chan!&#146;. But 
Sakura-chan was a little oblivious to matters of the heart and other 
things, and didn&#146;t notice, no matter how many times Tomoyo-chan said 
it.&#148; Tomoyo&#146;s smile turned a little sad. &#147;Eventually Tomoyo-chan came 
to the conclusion that she wasn&#146;t Sakura-chan&#146;s True Love, though 
Sakura-chan was her True Love. And so she searched for someone she 
could entrust Sakura-chan to, without any regrets. Unfortunately, 
Tomoyo-chan made a mistake. The boy she entrusted her True Love to, 
Syaoran-kun, took Sakura-chan away from Tomoyo-chan. Now Tomoyo-chan 
couldn&#146;t even be Sakura-chan&#146;s best friend. Syaoran-kun made it very 
clear when Tomoyo-chan tried to contact Sakura-chan that he could take 
care of Sakura-chan without Tomoyo-chan. He made sure they never 
talked again.&#148;
	Megumi looked over at Suzuni, knowing how she would feel if she 
was cut off from Suzuni. Poor Tomoyo!
	&#147;So Tomoyo-chan talked to the stars, even though all the light 
was gone from her life. Her only joys came from watching videos of 
Sakura-chan, and looking at pictures of Sakura-chan, and wishing 
Sakura-chan was happy. Iie&#133;she wished Sakura-chan would return to her. 
So over all the distance between them she looked up at the stars and 
wished Sakura-chan could hear her saying &#145;I will wait for you for all 
eternity, until you return to me&#146;. To this day Sakura-chan has not 
returned to the one person who would give her life to just hear Sakura 
one more time, to see her, to spend one last day with her beloved.&#148;
	Suzuni frowned. &#147;That&#146;s a sad story, but what does it have to do 
with you?&#148;
	Tomoyo and Megumi sweatdropped, smiling slightly. Megumi 
replied, &#147;Your ice-cream is melting. You had better go and eat it&#133;&#148;
	Suzuni was away in a flash, and Megumi stood up, then bowed 
respectfully to Tomoyo. &#147;You&#146;ve gone through a lot of pain. I don&#146;t 
know how I could stand it if that had happened to Suzuni and I. She 
finally realized how I felt only because her brother told her. She 
thought for a long time, for once. Then she told me exactly how she 
felt about the situation, and asked me out on a date. You&#146;re strong 
Tomoyo-chan.&#148;
	Tomoyo smiled. &#147;She reminds me of Sakura-chan in a few ways. 
Suzuni-san said something about you being the one who found out I was 
sad. How&#133;?&#148;
	Megumi blushed. &#147;Oh, I work at the shop across from here. 
And&#133;hasn&#146;t anyone ever told you that eyes are the windows to the soul? 
I hope she returns to you someday. I&#146;ll give you your ice cream free 
today.&#148;
	Tomoyo started to protest, but Megumi stopped her. &#147;In exchange 
for the wonderful story. Suzuni-chan and I will be getting married 
next month. We&#146;re both eighteen.&#148; Tomoyo looked surprised. Megumi took 
out a napkin and scribbled something down with a pencil. &#147;I&#146;m short 
for my age, and Suzuni just acts younger. We&#146;d be pleased if you came. 
Here&#133;bring Sakura-chan along when she returns to you. If she does in 
time, I mean.&#148; Megumi handed Tomoyo the napkin with, as Tomoyo soon 
saw, the details scribbled down upon it. &#147;I hope to see you both 
there.&#148;
~
	Tomoyo sighed, tucking the napkin into her pocket. She would 
definitely be at the wedding, though it was doubtful Sakura would 
return. She would be able to give her camcorder a workout after all 
these years. And Okaa-san would surely want to come along. Then they 
could both be happy that two girls reminding them of other people had 
found True Love together.
	Tomoyo glanced down as her watch beeped sweetly. Sweetly because 
Okaa-san hated normal watch beeping, and had insisted on a pretty 
sound for her design. &#147;The plane should arrive right&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Attention, attention, the plane from Hong Kong to Tomoeda has 
arrived! I repeat, the plane from Hong Kong to Tomoeda has arrived!&#148; 
The usual bored voice of the flight attendant announced.
	Tomoyo smiled, glancing back one last time at the two girls, who 
were now involved in a conversation, from what it looked like they 
were discussing ice cream flavors. &#147;&#133;&#148;
	Tomoyo giggled then shook her head and looked back as the door 
opened and passengers started filing in. Just as she always did, 
Tomoyo searched for Sakura in the line of people who got off, and as 
always, she saw no Sakura chan.
~
	Her watch rang again, and Tomoyo got up, heading for the ice 
cream shop. Just as she reached the middle of the hallway between the 
gate and the ice-cream shop as something hit her head hard, and she 
stumbled sideways, whatever it was hanging on to her head. &#147;Kyaa!&#148;
	Tomoyo fell to the ground, unable to regain her balance. She 
finally managed to get whatever-it-was off, noting before she got it 
off that it was making noises, like it was talking.
	Finally able to see the thing her eyes widened. &#147;No&#133;way&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Hiya, Tomoyo-chan! Got any chocolate on ya?&#148; The small yellow 
creature asked.
	&#147;Kero-chan&#133;?&#148; Tomoyo asked in disbelief. Was she dreaming?
	&#147;The one and only!&#148; Kero said.
	&#147;Should you really be zooming around in an airport?&#148; Tomoyo 
asked.
	&#147;Uh&#133;probably not.&#148; Kero sweatdropped. &#147;Gomen. I forgot about 
that&#133;I was so happy to see you! You can cook so well! Oh well. They&#146;ll 
just think I&#146;m a weird toy&#133;&#148; A few children were heard saying they 
wanted a toy like that.
	&#147;Kero-chan&#133;&#148; Tomoyo started.
	&#147;Want some help up, Tomoyo-chan?&#148; The one voice she had been 
sure she would never hear again asked, taking one of Tomoyo&#146;s hands in 
hers and pulling the pale heiress to her feet.
	&#147;Sakura-chan?! What are you doing in Tomoeda? Where&#146;s 
Syaoran-kun?&#148; Tomoyo was now sure that she was dreaming. She had to 
be&#133;
	Sakura&#146;s eyes darkened, then brightened. &#147;He&#146;s back in Hong 
Kong. A few months ago I started getting these weird dreams, and I 
started to think he&#146;d made you stop talking to me and writing to me. 
It turned out he had had the phone company block your number and he 
had all of the letters you sent stuffed in the family safe. I only 
found out after finding one in the mail by accident and by forcing him 
to tell me everything. The only reason I didn&#146;t come home sooner was 
because we had to get the divorce settled. I don&#146;t want to marry 
someone who would block me off from my very best friend&#133;&#148; Sakura 
hugged Tomoyo again, looking the only slightly shorter girl in the 
eyes. &#147;I missed you, Tomoyo-chan. So did Kero-chan and the cards.&#148;
	&#147;But&#133;Sakura-chan&#146;s happiness&#133;&#148; Tomoyo was now utterly confused, 
and yet understanding everything at the same time.
	&#147;I wasn&#146;t happy living with someone who would do that 
Tomoyo-chan. Besides, I finally figured out my heart. And what 
everyone else, like Onii-chan, Yukito-san, and even Meiling-chan had 
been hinting at. Not to mention Chiharu-chan, Naoko-chan, and 
Rika-chan. Even Yamazaki-chan tried to tell me a few times&#133;&#148; Sakura 
sweatdropped. &#147;And my Sakura cards&#133;And Kero-chan&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Kid, you&#146;d better stop or we&#146;ll be here forever. Face it: 
you&#146;re oblivious to some things. REALLY oblivious.&#148; Kero said, rolling 
his eyes. &#147;NOW I WANT CAKE!&#148;
	Sakura glared at Kero. &#147;Hey! Be nice or&#133;um&#133;NO DESERT FOR A 
MONTH!&#148;
	Kero immediately went silent.
	&#147;What are you trying to say Sakura-chan&#133;?&#148; Tomoyo prompted 
eagerly.
	Sakura blushed bright red. &#147;Um&#133;er&#133;uh&#133;that is&#133;I&#133;Tomoyo-chan, 
I&#133;uh&#133;I&#133;A-Aishiteru Tomoyo-chan.&#148; Sakura finally got out.
	Tomoyo started to cry as she heard the words she had waited her 
entire life to hear.
	Sakura looked at Tomoyo in concern and slight confusion. 
&#147;Tomoyo-chan! Don&#146;t cry&#133;are you alright?&#148; She gently wiped Tomoyo&#146;s 
eyes.
	&#147;I&#146;m fine Sakura-chan. It&#146;s just that I always knew you would 
save me, my beautiful emerald light.&#148; Tomoyo smiled gently.
	Sakura smiled nervously. &#147;Um, Tomoyo-chan?&#148;
	&#147;Yes Sakura-chan?&#148;
	Sakura put her hand behind her head, smiling. &#147;I was wondering 
if you would like&#133;to&#133;um&#133;&#148;
	Tomoyo giggled, and decided to help Sakura out. &#147;Would you like 
to go out some time Sakura? We could go get some ice cream before we 
get your luggage, and then maybe we can go out to dinner. It&#146;s a 
little backwards, but they have the best ice cream here.&#148;
	&#147;Hai!&#148; Sakura stopped, and looked at Tomoyo. &#147;Tomoyo, how did 
you know I would come home today?&#148;
	Tomoyo smiled. &#147;I didn&#146;t Sakura. I always come here every day. 
Then I get ice cream.&#148;
	Sakura frowned. &#147;But what would you have done if I never came?&#148;
	Tomoyo thought, then smiled again. &#147;I would have waited for you 
every day, until I was no longer in this world. For my Sakura-chan, I 
can bear anything.&#148;
	&#147;Tomoyo&#133;&#148;
	Tomoyo smiled brightly, all the sadness wiped away from her 
eyes. &#147;I love you Sakura. I always have, and always will. Oh&#133;I have a 
ton of costumes for you, but it looks like I might have to re-measure 
you and make a few changes to them&#133;&#148;
	&#147;But I&#146;ve got all the cards&#133;&#148; Sakura pointed out.
	&#147;Well, I have a theory.&#148; Kero said thoughtfully. &#147;Your magic 
didn&#146;t work when you left Tomeda, and therefore no evil was attracted, 
nor was any magic. I think your magic is powered by your love of 
Tomoyo-chan, because ever since we got here I&#146;ve felt stronger. Ever 
since you divorced the brat you&#146;ve even been able to invoke the cards. 
So, now that your magic is working you will have plenty of adventures. 
Believe me! Now let&#146;s get that ice cream.&#148;
~
A few weeks later&#133;	
	&#147;Time to throw the bouquets!&#148; Suzuni called out cheerfully.
	Sonomi ran over, determined to get one for herself. Suzuni threw 
hers, and Sonomi managed to get it by growling at the other women 
trying to get it.
	&#147;Okaa-san&#133;&#148; Tomoyo sweatdropped, then smiled.
	&#147;C&#146;mon! Throw yours Megumi!&#148; Suzuni ordered.
	Megumi looked at her newlywed wife and smiled slightly. 
&#147;Daijoubu&#133;&#148; Megumi smiled brightly as she saw Tomoyo. &#147;Tomoyo-chan! 
Catch!&#148; Tomoyo threw up her hands to shield her face from the flying 
bouquet, catching it in the process.
	&#147;Tomoyo-chan?&#148; Suzuni asked her wife. &#147;You mean she&#146;s the girl 
from the story?&#148;
	Megumi sweatdropped. &#147;Ah&#133;let&#146;s go get in the car and go start on 
the way to the airport so we can leave for our honeymoon, okay? I&#146;ll 
tell you about it on the way.&#148;
	Suzuni agreed cheerfully, and they were gone in an instant, as 
were most of the guests. Tomoyo continued to stare at the bouquet of 
cherry blossoms. Of course, Megumi was the type to do that on purpose. 
Over the past few weeks Sakura and Tomoyo had gotten to know the 
couple very well, along with Sonomi.
	Sakura tapped Tomoyo on the shoulder, smiling. &#147;You know, I 
think that&#146;s Megumi-chan giving us a hint, hmm?&#148;
	Tomoyo raised an eyebrow, smiling. &#147;You picked up on that?&#148;
	Sakura blushed. &#147;Megumi-chan explained to me all about the 
&#145;whoever catches the bouquet is the next to be married&#146; thing.&#148; Sakura 
admitted. &#147;She has also taken me to fifty jewelry stores in the past 
week.&#148;
	Tomoyo giggled. &#147;She really wants us to be &#145;happily ever 
after&#146;.&#148;
	&#147;I already am.&#148; Sakura said, blushing. &#147;Hoe&#133;&#148;
	&#147;What is it Sakura?&#148; Tomoyo asked.
	&#147;Um&#133;Tomoyowouldyouconsidermarryingme?&#148; Sakura asked in one 
breath.
	Tomoyo smiled. &#147;Of course. I&#146;d even say hai.&#148;
	Sakura smiled giddily. &#147;Oh, Tomoyo, you won&#146;t be sorry! 
I&#146;ll&#133;um&#133;be the very best wife it&#146;s possible to be! I love you Tomoyo.&#148;
	&#147;I love you too Sakura.&#148; Tomoyo took off a ring she had been 
wearing and slipped it on Sakura&#146;s ring finger. &#147;This can be your 
engagement ring. It was the ring my mother gave me. Your mother gave 
it to my mother when they were little, as a fake wedding ring. You 
know how little kids have pretend weddings. Okaa-san has had it ever 
since.&#148; Tomoyo explained.
	&#147;It&#146;s beautiful&#133;&#148; Sakura managed. The ring was a silver band 
inlayed with pearls in a swirling pattern.
	&#147;And an heirloom.&#148; Tomoyo said cheerfully.
	Sakura handed Tomoyo a ring and slipped it on Tomoyo&#146;s ring 
finger, which was a silver band with a small blue sapphire in the 
center, and Japanese writing around it, which read &#145;Aishiteru&#146;. 
&#147;Otou-san and Onii-chan helped me pick it out. Do you like it Tomoyo?&#148; 
Sakura asked anxiously.
	&#147;Of course!&#148; Tomoyo replied. &#147;Anything Sakura-chan gives me is 
precious beyond any treasure but Sakura-chan herself.&#148; Tomoyo handed 
Sakura the bouquet. &#147;Here. Since you asked me before I did you, you 
deserve this.&#148; She smiled brightly. &#147;Aishiteru, Sakura.&#148;
	&#147;Aishiteru Tomoyo. Gomen it took me so long to figure that out.&#148; 
Sakura replied.
	&#147;That&#146;s okay Sakura. I would have always loved you no matter 
what, and I do. I always will.&#148; Tomoyo leaned her head on Sakura&#146;s 
shoulder.
	&#147;And I you.&#148; Sakura said softly, leaning down to kiss her one 
True Love.
