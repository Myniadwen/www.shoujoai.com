<h1>Reflections of Love</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/id.html">ID of Fei</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Note! This takes place between episode 70 and the 2nd movie
&#39;The Sealed Card&#39;

-------------------

Sakura let out a huge sigh and laid her head on her arms.  Out of
desperation she&#39;d poured her heart out to her cards, she felt worse
now because she felt so stupid about doing so.  Clow, Kero and Yue
had all told her that the cards weren&#39;t the answer to every problem,
but Sakura didn&#39;t feel able to talk to anyone.  Why did this have to
happen?  It wasn&#39;t fair!

Sakura let out another sigh and pulled herself up from her chair and
moved to her bed and threw herself down.  She&#39;d stopped crying now at
least... now maybe she could manage a few hours of sleep.

Sakura looked back at her desk.  She wondered if any of her cards had
listened to her tears, or if they really were all asleep.

Sakura: &quot;Nobody was listening.&quot;

She told herself that.  It was 3am after all, everyone in the house
was asleep except herself.  Even Fujitaka had stopped making noise
about 2 hours ago.  Toya was staying at Yukito&#39;s tonight and Kero...
He was long since asleep.

Sakura closed her eyes and sank into the warm depths of sleep.

Sakura was mistaken... about 5 of the &#39;Sakura Cards&#39; were awake and
listening.  One had even shed tears of her own.

A giant mirror materialised in the middle of the bedroom floor.
The one who had shed tears stepped out of the mirror and stood next
to Sakura&#39;s bed, looking down upon her mistress.

Mirror: &quot;You are mistaken, I was listening.  We all love you and
want you to be happy.&quot;

She knelt down beside Sakura, raised her hand to Sakura&#39;s face and
smoothed Sakura&#39;s hair.  She couldn&#39;t do much, but as she had taken
the form of her Mistress several times and actually knew the spell to
summon the creatures sealed in the cards, this much she could do.

She picked up the Dream card.

Mirror: &quot;Give our Mistress pleasant dreams, Dream!&quot;

Sakura awakened after having a wonderful dream in which she was
flying high in the sky on a beautiful clear summer night and watching
fireworks.  She actually felt a bit better, a little comforted.
Some of her energy had returned to her.  Most likely because of the
odd dreams, that beautiful dream of watching fireworks in the sky and
the one before it of having her hair stroked.

Sakura sat up and rubbed her eyes.  Something pink on the bed caught
her attention.  She looked and found two cards lying there beside her.

Sakura: &quot;Hue?&quot;

Sakura picked up the two cards and looked at them.

Sakura: &quot;MIRROR... DREAM...&quot;

Kero emerged from his drawer giving a huge yawn.

Kero: &quot;Ohayo Sakura, how are you feeling today?&quot;

Sakura: &quot;Kero chan, did you take these cards from the desk and put
them beside me when I was sleeping?&quot;

Kero: &quot;No, why?&quot;

Kero flew to Sakura and looked at the cards in her hands.

Kero: &quot;Mirror and Dream...&quot;

Kero hovered there thinking for a while.

Kero: &quot;Maybe you took them out in your sleep.&quot;

Sakura thought for a long time.

Sakura: &quot;Kero chan, not only did these cards somehow get onto my bed,
but I had a dream last night... and it&#39;s not the kind of dreams I
usually have.&quot;

Kero: &quot;Was it a foretelling dream?&quot;

Sakura shook her head.

Sakura: &quot;It was a really nice dream.  I was flying in the sky and
watching fireworks.&quot;

Kero: &quot;Maybe the cards were worried about you because you&#39;ve been
depressed ever since that kid went back to Hong Kong.  Hmmm it&#39;s
interesting that Mirror was there too... well you&#39;ve asked her to
cover for you so many times I think it&#39;s natural that she feels
close enough to you to worry.&quot;

Sakura hugged the two cards.

Sakura: &quot;Thank you Mirror, thank you Dream.  I feel better now.&quot;

Sakura looked at her clock and saw that it was past 11am.

Sakura: &quot;HUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, I slept this long?!&quot;

Sakura got up, got dressed and fixed her hair.  Yes today was
Sunday, but sleeping until past 11 was...  Sakura put her hand on
her doorknob and looked back at Kero.

Sakura: &quot;I don&#39;t think Father is here today, and big brother has
his part time job, so wait here a minute while I check.&quot;

Kero nodded, grinning in anticipation of dessert, rubbing his front
paws together.

Sakura left the room and went downstairs.  She looked at the board.

Fujitaka: At a conference of archaeologists, home late.
Toya: Yuki&#39;s / Part Time Job, home late.

Sakura: &quot;Kero chan, it&#39;s all clear!&quot;

Sakura looked at the table.  Breakfast was laid out for her and
covered over.  On top of breakfast was a note written in Fujitaka&#39;s
neat handwriting which read.

&quot;Sakura san, I know you are having a bad time right now and I worry
about you a lot.  I&#39;m sorry I have to be away today, but please be
sure to eat and keep your spirits up.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;Arigato, father.&quot;

Sakura went to the fridge and took out a dessert.  She placed it and
a spoon on the table and set about making tea.

Kero: &quot;Waaaai Dessert!&quot;

Kero flew into the kitchen and sat down on the table next to his
dessert.

Kero:  &quot;So, Sakura, what are you going to do today?&quot;

Sakura: &quot;I don&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t decided...&quot;

Sakura looked thoughtful.  She was disturbed from her thoughts by
the sound of the doorbell.

Sakura: &quot;HAAAAIII!&quot;

Sakura hurried to the door.  Upon opening the door, she found
Tomoyo standing there with a worried look on her face.

Tomoyo: &quot;Sakura chan... how are you feeling?  I was so worried and I
wanted to see you today.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;Tomoyo chan... I&#39;m feeling a little bit better today, come
in, I was making tea.&quot;

Tomoyo: &quot;Arigatou gozaimasu.&quot;

Tomoyo entered the Kinomoto house, changed from her shoes into the
slippers that Sakura put out for her and then followed Sakura to the
kitchen.

Tomoyo took in the sight of a breakfast laid out on the table and
Kero sitting at the table in front of one of Fujitaka&#39;s delicious
desserts, obviously waiting for the tea that Sakura mentioned.

Sakura: &quot;I&#39;m sorry Tomoyo chan, I slept late today and I haven&#39;t had
breakfast yet.&quot;

Tomoyo: &quot;I do not mind, it&#39;s important to eat a good breakfast so
please go ahead.&quot;

Tomoyo sat down at the table and thanked Sakura when she put a
dessert and spoon, and later a cup of tea down for her.  Having
eaten, Sakura found herself feeling a little better again and spent a
pleasant afternoon with Tomoyo.  Sakura told Tomoyo about the dream
and waking up to find Dream and Mirror lying beside her on the bed.
Tomoyo shared the same opinion as Kero, that the cards were worried
because their Mistress was so depressed.

That night when Sakura was safely asleep, Mirror came out again.
Kero secretly watched from his drawer.

Kero: &quot;So... Mirror knows how to summon herself...&quot;

Kero pondered this.  Clow had made Mirror with the ability to take on
ALL attributes of the person she copied.  Kero understood this, it
also meant that Mirror was able to use some of the Card Captor&#39;s
power too, including the ability to summon herself, and other cards...
probably not the higher powered cards, like Time or the elemental
cards like Windy and Firey, but he didn&#39;t see how Dream could be out
of Mirror&#39;s reach.

A memory struck Kero all of a sudden.  Mirror... Clow had actually
used Mirror to act as a decoy once when fighting an enemy.  Mirror
had taken on Clow&#39;s form and had used lower and intermediate level
cards in the battle.  Kero resumed watching Mirror.  She knelt beside
Sakura and stroked Sakura&#39;s hair.

Mirror: &quot;I love you Mistress, I love you so much and I will do
anything to see you happy.&quot;

Kero: &quot;NANIIIII!&quot;

Kero lost his grip and banged his head.  His shock at hearing Mirror
say that had caused him to slip and bang his head.  Mirror gasped
in surprise and turned to the drawer.

Mirror: &quot;Who is there?&quot;

Kero flew out of the drawer and went to Mirror&#39;s side.

Kero. &quot;Yo.&quot;

Mirror.  &quot;Keroberos!&quot;

Kero. &quot;So, you&#39;re worried too.&quot;

Mirror nodded.

Mirror: &quot;Mistress has been so sad, I just... wanted to do something for
her to ease her pain a little.&quot;

Kero: &quot;Well I wanted to go to Hong Kong and teach that Li kid a
lesson or two for hurting Sakura... I understand how you feel.&quot;

Kero said this with a smile.

Kero: &quot;Do all of the cards feel the same way?&quot;

Mirror nodded.  Kero remembered the last time Mirror had acted as
representative of the cards, back during the time when Eriol had
taught Sakura to play that hymn.  Mirror was one of the very few
cards with a voice that the still inexperienced Card Captor could
understand.  Kero understood Mirror&#39;s feelings and he appreciated her
sentiment.  Anything which would get Sakura back in a good mood would
help, and the knowledge that her cards appreciated her and loved her
would definitely help.

Kero to himself: &quot;Hopefully you&#39;ll see that you don&#39;t need that Li
kid.&quot;

Kero moved back to his drawer.

Kero: &quot;I&#39;m going to sleep, good night Mirror.&quot;

Without waiting for a reply, Kero sank down into the drawer and
closed it.  He sank into the bed that Sakura had made for him and
went to sleep.

Mirror turned back to the sleeping Sakura... but the exchange of words
had disturbed Sakura and now Sakura wasn&#39;t asleep anymore.

Sakura: &quot;Mirror san?&quot;

Mirror: &quot;Mistress, please do not be alarmed.  I mean no harm, we
cards have been worried because you have been so depressed.&quot;

Sakura to herself: &quot;This touch on my head... it feels... the same as last
night.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;Mirror san... was it you... last night?&quot;

Mirror: &quot;Yes.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;I see...&quot;

Sakura, now wide awake sat up and took Mirror&#39;s hand in hers, somehow
feeling extremely touched.  Sakura found herself enjoying the feeling
of the soft warm hand that she held in her own, the clear eyes on the
pretty face were exquisite.  Those ribbons in Mirror&#39;s hair... Sakura
had always wondered where those had come from.

Sakura: &quot;Mirror san, can I ask you a question?&quot;

Mirror: &quot;Of course.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;In the beginning, you didn&#39;t have those ribbons... where did
you get them from? I&#39;ve always wondered.&quot;

Mirror was silent for a while, but in light of everything, Toya
giving his magical power to Yue, Sakura may as well know, it
wouldn&#39;t harm anything now.

Mirror: &quot;Mistress&#39;s older brother.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;Onii... Toya?&quot;

Sakura was still surprised to hear that.

Mirror: &quot;It seems that he knew that I was not you all along.  He gave
these ribbons to me the day you asked me to go in your place to buy
your father&#39;s present.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;Oh...&quot;

Mirror: &quot;It seems that he knows everything, about you being the Card
Captor and having magical powers.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;hue....&quot;

After Toya had given his own magical power to Yue, Sakura had
suspected he knew something, but she didn&#39;t realise...

Mirror: &quot;Are you angry?&quot;

Sakura: &quot;N...no I&#39;m not angry, I&#39;m just surprised.&quot;

A sudden yawn struck Sakura.

Mirror: &quot;You should go back to sleep.  I apologise for disturbing you.&quot;

Sakura laid back down.  Mirror was right, after all, it was late and
she had school tomorrow.

Sakura: &quot;Goodnight Mirror san.&quot;

Mirror: &quot;Goodnight.&quot;

Sakura closed her eyes.  Mirror couldn&#39;t resist and found herself
stroking Sakura&#39;s soft hair again.  Sakura didn&#39;t say anything
negative because she found it soothing and before long, her breathing
was even and regular as she slept soundly.

Mirror: &quot;Goodnight Mistress, I love you.&quot;

Mirror pressed a soft kiss to Sakura&#39;s cheek and watched her sleep
until dawn.


As Sakura walked to school the following morning, she thought about
Mirror.  As she thought about Mirror, she felt butterflies, but she
also felt confused, trying to work something out.  Then it suddenly
hit her!

Sakura: &quot;I didn&#39;t cast the spell to summon her! How did Mirror
san...?&quot;

Yukito: &quot;Ohayo Sakura chan.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;Hue? Oh, ohayo Yukito san.&quot;

Yukito: &quot;You look like you&#39;re thinking hard about something.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;Something strange has happened...&quot;

Sakura wanted a more expert opinion, Kero wasn&#39;t here and she was
early for school...

Sakura: &quot;I need to speak to Yue about it.&quot;

Yukito suddenly grew wings and began to float in the air.  The wings
closed around him and after the flash of light, Yue floated there,
gazing silently at his master.

Even though she was well used to him now, Sakura still found Yue&#39;s
gaze a little... intimidating, but she needed an answer, it was really
bothering her.

Sakura: &quot;Yue san... for the past two nights, Mirror has been
transforming from her card on her own, I haven&#39;t been casting the
spell to summon her...&quot;

Yue: &quot;...&quot;

Sakura: &quot;In fact, I&#39;ve been asleep.&quot;

Yue: &quot;Could it be that you called Mirror in your sleep?&quot;

Sakura shaking head: &quot;No, it&#39;s not like that time with the dream
card... my star wand was still sealed...&quot;

Yue: &quot;Could it be...?  No...?&quot;

Sakura: &quot;What...?  Do you know?&quot;

Yue: &quot;I need time to think about this.  I will give you an answer
this evening.&quot;

-------------------

That evening.

Both Kero and Yue were sitting in Sakura&#39;s bedroom in their proper
forms discussing Mirror&#39;s behaviour while Sakura was making tea.
Sakura felt a little better having her Guardians trying to work this
out.  Sakura herself had an idea of how Mirror was able to summon
herself, but Sakura didn&#39;t feel that it was right.  She thought about
this as she prepared the tea.

Sakura to herself: &quot;Maybe it&#39;s because Mirror san has taken my form
and knows how to use some of my magical powers.&quot;

Upstairs.

Kero: &quot;The only thing I can think of is that when Clow allowed Mirror
to use magic back when he had that duel...&quot;

Yue: &quot;And Mirror has become able to use the Card Captor&#39;s magic after
taking her form several times...&quot;

Kero: &quot;Yes exactly...&quot;

Yue: &quot;But to be able to do it without the star wand...&quot;

Kero: &quot;Clow would know.&quot;

Yue: &quot;Why would Mirror act like this?&quot;

Kero: &quot;Sakura was depressed after that kid went back to Hong Kong...
even the cards were worried.&quot;

Yue thought about this.  He nodded his acceptance of that after a
while, he had been worried too, because while Toya was his source
of power right now, he still received power from Sakura, and her
depression was clearly obvious in her power.

After all three coming to the same conclusion, Sakura and Kero
decided to stay awake to watch Mirror as she appeared.  Kero would be
watching from his drawer and Sakura would be pretending to be asleep.

That plan was put in to operation that night.

Sakura lay in bed struggling to keep herself awake and failing.
She eventually drifted off to sleep.  Kero was awake though.

After a short while, Kero watched as the book of cards opened and a
glowing card floated out, floating until it was over an open space on
the floor, and then the mirror appeared and Mirror stepped out into
Sakura&#39;s bedroom.

Kero to himself: &quot;What the hell?&quot;*

Mirror did her usual thing of kneeling at Sakura&#39;s bedside.

Sakura wasn&#39;t so depressed anymore, in fact she was returning to
normal, so why was Mirror doing this?

Mirror brushed some of Sakura&#39;s hair away from her face.

Mirror: &quot;I love you...&quot;

Those words were whispered, but Kero was still able to hear them.

He felt like he had his answer.  To his memory, nothing like this had
happened before.  He didn&#39;t think that Mirror would willingly do
anything to hurt Sakura... but he decided to keep watch, just in case.
He didn&#39;t know if this was a passing phase, or if Mirror really did
feel that way... was it platonic love or was it romantic love?

For the next few nights, Mirror just watched Sakura sleep until dawn
and then transformed back into the card.  Kero began to relax because
he didn&#39;t feel any danger to Sakura at all.

Sunday night.

Sakura finished her weekend homework and put everything away in her
bag ready for school tomorrow.  She stretched herself thinking that a
late night snack would be a good idea before having a bath and
getting ready for bed.  She&#39;d also swipe a dessert for Kero who&#39;d
complained earlier today because he hadn&#39;t had any of the cake that
Fujitaka had bought as a treat.  Sakura had learned how scary Kero&#39;s
food grudges could be.

Sakura to herself: &quot;Hueeee, I don&#39;t want THAT to happen again.&quot;

Sakura said that to herself thinking of the time at Tomoyo&#39;s house
with the Lock card.

She stood up.  Kero looked up from the manga he was reading.

Kero: &quot;Finished your homework already?&quot;

Sakura: &quot;Mmmm and I thought I&#39;d get a snack.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll bring
something for you too.&quot;

Kero: &quot;Yeah! Cake!&quot;

Kero looked back at the manga again.

Sakura: &quot;Hueeee.&quot;

Sakura arrived in the kitchen.  Nobody was around so this would be
easy.  She looked in the fridge where the cake was being stored...
and...

Sakura: &quot;Onii san!&quot;

The remainder of the cake was gone.

There were desserts there, and Kero liked them almost as much as
cake, so hopefully he&#39;d be appeased if she brought him one of
those.

Sakura then made herself a snack and returned to her bedroom,
closing the door behind her.

Sakura: &quot;Sorry Kero-chan, my horrible Onii-san ate the rest of the
cake.&quot;

Sakura put the dessert on the floor beside Kero.

Kero: &quot;Ah... can&#39;t be helped I suppose.&quot;

Kero picked up the spoon and scooped up a large spoonful of the
vanilla dessert.

Sakura shook her head.  Kero didn&#39;t need to eat, but he went crazy
over sweet things... he was unbelievable!

Sakura sighed and then began to eat her own snack.  She looked at
her school schedule which reminded her about...

Kero: &quot;Sakura, isn&#39;t your school having that trip to that new western
chocolate factory tomorrow?&quot;

Sakura gave a mental &#39;Hueeee&#39;.  Right on cue!

Sakura: &quot;That&#39;s right Kero chan.  I&#39;ll remember to bring something
back for you.&quot;

Kero: &quot;Hehe, chocolate!  You&#39;d better remember Sakura.&quot;

Sakura: &quot;Really! You don&#39;t need to eat!&quot;

Kero: &quot;But I like sweet things!  Are you going to just forget
everything I do for you? Don&#39;t you think I deserve rewards for being
your guardian?&quot;

Sakura sighed and gave up.  She did NOT want to trigger one of Kero&#39;s
food grudges.  Yue never EVER demanded anything, Kero should try to
be more like Yue.

Sakura to herself: &quot;I wonder if Mirror san likes chocolate.&quot;

Kero had reported that Mirror was still coming out to watch her
sleep, but he hadn&#39;t reported her saying &#39;I love you&#39; at least twice
every night.

Sakura finished her snack then she and Kero went for a bath.

After bathing, Sakura and Kero returned to Sakura&#39;s room.  As she
stood in the upstairs hallway, she could hear music playing faintly
in the background.

Sakura: &quot;Hue? Music?&quot;

Kero: &quot;You weren&#39;t listening to music.&quot;

Sakura followed the sound of the music, Kero right beside her and
found that it was coming from her own bedroom.  Listening closely,
Sakura also recognised the song as the recording she had made that
time when she&#39;d asked Eriol to teach her that hymn.

Sakura opened her door and went inside, ready to shout at Toya for
going through her things.

It wasn&#39;t Toya though.

Mirror was sitting at Sakura&#39;s desk, listening to the song and
sobbing quietly.

Sakura: &quot;Mirror san!&quot;

Mirror looked up and at Sakura in shock.  Sakura hurried over.

Sakura: &quot;Mirror san, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

There was no reply, Mirror just sat at the desk, looking at Sakura
with a shocked expression with tears streaming down her cheeks.

Not knowing what else to do, Sakura bent over and drew Mirror into a
hug.  Mirror froze for a long long moment and then held Sakura and
cried into her shoulder for a long long time.

To be continued....

-------------------

Well this is my first attempt at a Card Captor Sakura fic, please
don&#39;t hate it too much.  This is the first part of a 2 or 3 part fic,
if people actually like it, then i&#39;ll continue it.
