<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/samurai.html">Siobhan Petit</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s note:

Konnichiwa minna-san! This fanfic is some kind of a 
prolouge to I Could Not Ask for More although this story 
can also be independent. But I advise you to read this 
first.

Many thanks to Heather for urging me to write fanfics and 
draw fanarts. She really rocks you know. 

How I wish that I am one of the four ladies of Clamp that 
pioneered CCS, but sadly, I will just go on dreaming. The 
characters are owned by them, so please don&#39;t sue me. I got 
the title from Sara McLachlan&#39;s very beautiful song. I play 
this song everytime I write this fic.

If you have any comments or suggestions, I&#39;m very grateful 
to know them so please e-mail me. I dedicate this fic to my 
girl...more than ever.

Bon appetit!

Daidouji Sonomi was biting her lip as she willed her 
Carrera Targa forward, the Porsche&#39;s engine seemed thrilled 
as she went faster than a hundred kilometers. If she could 
force the car to fly then she could&#39;ve done it already. She 
was not an impatient woman, and they say patience is a 
virtue. Well now it isn&#39;t! Sonomi scoffed angrily. Hours of 
flight from the other side of the world and four hours of 
sleep had given her a whacking headache. She stole a glance 
to the overhead mirror and saw a wretched woman in a 
wrinkled Chanel suit and askew tie. Darn it, she hadn&#39;t 
even mustered to comb her short auburn hair. She had been 
in a hurry, left her three-year old daughter with her 
governess in their hotel suite, and dash immediately after 
a nerve-wracking phone call. She looked at her diamond-
studded watch. Half-past four in the morning. Another turn 
and her eyes automatically looked upward, past the tinted 
glass roof of the Porsche. Dawn would be in a long moment 
later on. The stars had not yet disappeared. But she would 
be driving in this road at any given time despite any given 
circumstances that heaven preordained.
	The road was now snaking its way up to the lush green 
hills, and she can already see the family&#39;s summer 
residence. Her grandfather&#39;s retreat.  The muscles of 
Sonomi&#39;s jaw began to tighten at the sight. Memories 
automatically poured by. Suddenly, she was sixteen again, 
transported to a time that had long since passed by but the 
memory was still fresh on her mind, still intact.
	She remembered the rest house clearly as if it had been 
one lucid summer morning seven years ago. It was a 
magnificent mansion in Gregorian architecture, perched on 
the granite sides of the lush hills. On a lovely, warm 
summer, the grandeur of the house was seen more vividly. It 
resembled a formidable giant ready to leap from the stone 
cliffs. It was a vision to behold. It stood aloof but 
magnificent with a crown of great fluffy clouds on its 
roofs amidst a clear blue sky.
	This sight always thrilled her and her cousin whenever 
they came to visit and spend their summer holidays here. 
From their car&#39;s window, they would both stare at the house 
with excited eyes and exhuberant hearts as their Grandpa&#39;s 
chauffer maneuvers the black vintage, whitewall-tired 
Rolls-Royce through the mountain road.
	&quot;Look, Sonomi-chan! There it is at last!&quot; Amamiya 
Nadeshiko shrieked with glee as the Rolls made the turn, 
the house peeking into view behind pine trees. Still 
uncontented, Nadeshiko opened the car&#39;s window and stick 
out her head. The wind immediately played havoc with her 
long, dark hair as she watch their ascent to the hills. She 
inhaled, savoring the fresh air. She can&#39;t wait to leave 
the congesting air of the city behind and spend her summer 
up here, with Sonomi, of course. &quot;Isn&#39;t it grand, Sonomi-
chan?&quot;	
	The girl with the short, slant hairstyle nodded. She&#39;s a 
pretty young woman with intelligent purple eyes and 
patrician features, so starkly contrasting Nadeshiko&#39;s 
chaste and angelic beauty. But she, unlike Nadeshiko, was 
not hanging her head from the car&#39;s window. She simply sat 
there in the backseat, contentedly admiring her energetic 
but fragile cousin. She loved the image Nadeshiko gives as 
her cousin knelt on the seat and let the wind toyed her 
hair in wild disarray, the sunlight intensifying even more 
Nadeshiko&#39;s olive-green eyes and ivory complexion. &quot;Hai, 
right you are, darling,&quot; she said after a moment. &quot;But 
please, don&#39;t hang your head and do sit properly before a 
truck pass as by. You will be lucky to spend your summer 
with your head torn off.&quot;
	Nadeshiko pouted. Sonomi was still overprotective of her 
as always, but something that was reassuring and not 
suffocating. It makes her feel certainly special to be 
treated and pampered by Sonomi like this. She sweatdropped 
and embarrassingly scratched her head. &quot;But Sonomi-chan...&quot; 
she smiled mischievously but followed nonetheless, and 
settled herself next to her cousin in the backseat.	
	&quot;There, there. Be a good girl now, will you?&quot; Sonomi 
sniggered and patted Nadeshiko like a kitty.
	Soon, all of the signposts of civilization vanished and 
the car was swallowed by the wilderness of spectacular 
beauty. This is Amamiya land, preserved untouched by the 
progress if the city. It is hundreds of hectares of 
woodlands and meadows, crisscrossed by hunting trails and 
bordered by two private brooks. The summer residence had 
always been dear to Sonomi because all of the memories of 
their childhood.
	Moments later, the black vintage car screeched to a stop 
in front of the mansion. The two heiresses already knew 
that their grandfather is here, probably in his study-
library and waiting for them. Nadeshiko eagerly bolted out 
and ran immediately towards the house. She literally leapt 
and made a dash inside, ignoring the courteous greetings of 
the house staff.
	&quot;Grandpa! I&#39;m so glad to see you again!&quot; she exclaimed 
gaily when she found him in his study sitting behind a 
massive pinewood desk and busily reading some doucuments. 
Her ouji-sama put them down and she kissed him tenderly on 
his forehead. She could smell the scent of tobacco and 
peppermint in him. Oh, its really nice to be back.
	&quot;Okaeri, Nadeshiko hime-sama,&quot; the old man chided gently. 
I&#39;m so glad to see you too.&quot; Her lovely granddaughter 
frowned.
	&quot;I&#39;m not a princess, Grandpa.&quot;	
	The old man tickled Nadeshiko&#39;s cheek. &quot;But you are to 
me.&quot;
	The young lady giggled again.
	&quot;Tadaima, Ouji-sama!&quot;
	The patriarch of the Amamiya family looked up and saw his 
other favorite granddaughter smiling at him from the door. 
Unlike Nadeshiko who was always carefree and intense, 
Sonomi is reserved and liked being in control. Yet he loved 
them both immensely. They were the greatest happiness of 
his life. &quot;Irrashai-mase, Sonomi. What are you doing there? 
Come and give your old man a hug,&quot; he said and opened his 
arms widely.
	Sonomi bounced happily towards her grandfather and 
embrace him around his neck, then gave him a peck on the 
cheek., his beard giving him the tickles. &quot;You look great,
Grandpa.
	&quot;And so are you, Sonomi.&quot;
	Nadeshiko suddenly poked her grandfather&#39;s side. &quot;Ne, 
Ouji-sama, do you know that Sonomi-chan championed our 
athletics again? She was so good that all of our classmates 
were cheering for her. You should&#39;ve seen her dash. She&#39;s 
like a bullet, Grandpa!&quot;
	Sonomi blushed ferociously. Why does it feel this mushy 
evertytime she hears her beloved cousin mouthed praises out 
of those lips? But somehow, she had already known the 
answer since they were only ten. And now that they are 
sixteen already, that feeling hadn&#39;t changed a bit. She 
noticed that it had even evolved into something far 
stronger, deeper, and more intense. What idiot could resist 
Nadeshiko&#39;s charm? She wiggled her toes, feeling the warmth 
travel from her face downward. She scratched the back of 
her head. &quot;Uhm... its not like that, Nadeshiko-chan. I just 
got a bit lucky, you know.&quot;
	&quot;Lucky?&quot; Nadeshiko scoffed. &quot;You call that lucky, making 
Kumi-chan and the others eat dust? She told me afterwards 
that her breath was up to her neck and she would never race 
you again lest she wanted to land in a hospital ward with 
some defibrillators. Uh-un, you aren&#39;t. You really are the 
best of them all! Isn&#39;t it, Grandpa?&quot;
	The old man nodded, clearly amused. Who wants to argue 
with Nadeshiko? &quot;I think so too, yes.&quot;
	The ivory-skinned girl grinned and her jade eyes roamed 
to Sonomi that read &#39;See? I told you so.&#39;
	Their grandfather stood up and brought them to the door. 
&quot;So now, both of you must rest and freshen yourselves, 
alright? And afterwards you could start whatever 
pleasurable activity you&#39;re planning to do. Did you have 
breakfast, by the way?&quot;
	Sonomi shook her head. &quot;Actually, we didn&#39;t. We&#39;re so 
eager to be here we had no time to eat. I&#39;m famished 
already.&quot;
	Nadeshiko suddenly clasped her hands. &quot;I know what we 
have to do, Sonomi-chan! Why don&#39;t we reign in our horses, 
pack a hamper and have breakfast in the meadows? Surely by 
now the flowers are in full bloom. Say it&#39;s a lovely idea, 
please, Sonomi-chan!&quot; she exclaimed with glee.	
	Nadeshiko&#39;s enthusiasm was so infectious, Sonomi thought. 
&quot;Alright, Nadeshiko-chan. Riding with you and having 
breakfasts in the meadow is very lovely indeed.&quot;
	&quot;Sugoi!&quot; Nadeshiko brightened up. I&#39;ll go to the kitchens 
now and make the chef rummage something. Then, I&#39;ll change 
to my riding suit. Wait for me by the threshold, ne, 
Sonomi-chan?&quot;
	Sonomi nodded.	
	Her cousin took off like a shot.	
	When Sonomi prepared to leave, she felt her grandfather&#39;s 
hand on her shoulder. She was surprise to see the old man&#39;s 
eyes in mist.
	&quot;She&#39;s an angel, isn&#39;t she?&quot; the old man asked softly.
	She nodded. &quot;Hai, Ouji-sama.&quot;	
	The old man sighed. Sonomi can sense the happiness in her 
grandfather just by watching him gaze at his favorite 
grandchild. Yet, she does not feel any jealousy towards her 
cousin. All the members of the family love Nadeshiko and 
its just a simple fact. The vivacious, dark-haired girl had 
been their pride, their jewel, the star of the Amamiya 
family. And she was thinking that somehow she had served an 
important role in Nadeshiko&#39;s life. For their family&#39;s own 
princess, she had been the knight. The proud samurai always 
ready to defend her ladyship. And she had promised to 
fulfill her role dutifully.	
	The present Sonomi gritted her teeth angrily as she turn 
the steering wheel. She hadn&#39;t stick to her promise. She 
had abandoned her duty, had been a coward herself. She had 
lost once, and today, she had been destined to lose again.

Sonomi was in every inch the fine noblewoman with her white 
silk riding shirt matched with a black cravat around her 
neck. As she stood patiently waiting under the sun in the 
front lawn, the wind played messily with the strands of her 
short auburn hair, the sun accentuating its golden 
highlights. Her black skin-tight riding breeches fully 
complimenting the shape of her hips and legs, paired with 
handcrafted English boots. She easily drew admiring stares 
from the house staff, but her charming smile quickly put 
them at ease. It was a ladylike, authoritative look that 
Sonomi can emit which was the product of regal upbringing 
and not of any forced effort at all.</pre>
