<h1>The One You Love Best</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/abraxis.html">Star Knight Abraxis</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      She&#39;d set up a camera, hidden away in one corner of the room, to 
tape all this.  She couldn&#39;t trust her hands not to start shaking at 
a moment like this... but she wanted this recorded.  For closure, if 
nothing else.
       &quot;Thanks for having me over, Tomoyo-chan!  I still wanted to 
talk to you about what to do for Shaoran-kun now that he&#39;s leaving. 
I&#39;m a little nervous...&quot;
       &#39;You&#39;re not the only one, Sakura-chan,&#39; she thought.  &quot;Can we 
talk about that a little later?  There&#39;s... there&#39;s something I 
wanted to tell you first.&quot;
      &quot;Oh?&quot;  Sakura plopped down on Tomoyo&#39;s bed, clutching a stuffed 
animal to her in a manner so cute as to set Tomoyo&#39;s pulse racing. 
&quot;What is it?&quot;
      Tomoyo took a deep breath, steadying herself.  She knew she 
shouldn&#39;t be doing this; it was so horribly selfish... but she had to 
tell Sakura.  Just once, before Sakura went off to Shaoran forever. 
&quot;Sakura-chan...  I love you.&quot;
      Sakura smiled brilliantly.  &quot;I know that, Tomoyo-chan!  I love
you too!&quot;
      &quot;No!&quot;  Tomoyo cut her off, a bit more sharply than she intended. 
&quot;I... don&#39;t mean just like that.  I&#39;m in love with you, Sakura-chan. 
Passionately.  Romantically.  With all my heart.&quot;
      Sakura nodded, looking a little confused.  &quot;I know.  Like I 
said, I love you too.&quot;
      Tomoyo blinked.  Her mouth went dry.  &quot;Y-you... know?&quot;
      &quot;Well, sure.  I mean, why else would we have been dating for so long?&quot;
      Tomoyo sat down heavily on the bed.  She couldn&#39;t quite feel her 
legs anymore.  &quot;D...dating?&quot;
      Now Sakura was looking a little worried.  &quot;All those things 
we&#39;ve done together, just the two of us, like going to movies or the 
shrine festivals, even catching Clow Cards sometimes.  Well, 
Kero-chan was there too, but he&#39;s sort of a chaperone, I guess.&quot;  She 
looked at Tomoyo with concern.  &quot;Didn&#39;t you think they were romantic 
enough?&quot;
      She had, oh how she had, but she had been sure that was all in 
her own mind.  But for Sakura to feel the same way?
      No.  It was impossible.   &quot;What about Shaoran-kun?&quot;
      Sakura blinked.  &quot;What about him?  I wanted some advice on 
whether I should get him a going-away present or something, but that 
can wait.  Whatever you&#39;re worried about is more important.&quot;
      &quot;No, it&#39;s just... I thought you, well... had a crush on him?&quot;
      &quot;Hoe?&quot;  Sakura shook her head.  &quot;The only person other than you 
I&#39;ve ever had a crush on was Yukito-san, and that turned out to be 
just because he was Yue and I was attracted to the magic.&quot;  She 
blushed a little.  &quot;I don&#39;t think I ever thanked you enough for 
putting up with me through all that.  I mean, some of the time, it 
must have seemed like I&#39;d dumped you for him.  But... it wasn&#39;t like 
that.  It was just... I think the magic dazzled me, and I couldn&#39;t 
think of anything else whenever I saw him.&quot;  She looked down, a 
little ashamed.  &quot;I don&#39;t know why you didn&#39;t just abandon me when I 
did that.  I must have seemed so heartless, and you could do so much 
better than me...&quot;
      Tomoyo jolted slightly at that.  &quot;But there&#39;s no one better than 
you, Sakura-chan!&quot;  The words almost came by reflex, so overwhelmed 
was she by the revelation after revelation, but they were of course 
truer than anything she knew.
      Sakura smiled, blushing.  &quot;Thank you, Tomoyo-chan.  That&#39;s one 
of the reasons I love you so much.  Because you can always see the 
best in me, even when I can&#39;t.&quot;
      Now Tomoyo could feel herself blushing, her cheeks warm with 
embarrassment.  &#39;Reasons she loves me.  She loves me.  Sakura-chan 
loves me.&#39;  The words were spinning dizzily around her brain, not 
actually completely sinking in yet.  But oh, how beautiful they 
were...
      &quot;I know I haven&#39;t always been the perfect girlfriend, but I hope 
I can always make you happy.  And I want to always be there for you. 
Because you&#39;ve always been the best part of my life.  You always make 
me feel special. 
      &quot;And because I love you.&quot;
      Sakura took Tomoyo&#39;s hands in her own, gently.  &quot;Is that what 
you were worried about?  You were thinking I might be falling for 
Shaoran-kun?&quot;
      &quot;Well... maybe a little,&quot; Tomoyo breathed dazedly.  &#39;Her skin is 
so soft...&#39;
      Sakura smiled.  &quot;Well, don&#39;t worry.  I don&#39;t love him.  He&#39;s a 
good friend, but he&#39;s a boy... and he&#39;s not you.  I want to grow up 
with you.  I want to give my first kiss to you, some special night. 
I even want to marry you, if we could, someday.  And someday, when 
we&#39;re both old ladies, I want to sit with you watching your tapes of 
us as little kids and laugh at how silly we used to be, and sigh at 
how in love we were even then.  Even now.
      &quot;I want to be with you forever.&quot;
      All Tomoyo could see was Sakura&#39;s beautiful green eyes, staring 
into hers, full of love.  How had she not seen it before?
      She heard, distantly, her mother&#39;s voice shouting from 
downstairs.  &quot;Sakura-chan, your brother&#39;s on the phone.  He wants to 
talk to you.&quot;
      &quot;Mou...&quot;  Sakura groaned exasperatedly.  &quot;He sure can pick the 
wrong moment.  I&#39;ll be right back, Tomoyo-chan.&quot;  Sakura drew her 
girlfriend into a quick but close hug, then stood to race out the 
door.
      Slowly, Tomoyo looked around the room.  Her eyes fell on the 
camera, still hidden in the corner, still recording the stunned look 
on her face.
      And to think she&#39;d wanted to see *Sakura&#39;s* expression!
      And with that thought, the disbelief left her all in a rush, 
leaving only giddy happiness.  Sakura-chan loved her.  The same way 
Tomoyo loved her back.  She&#39;d loved her for the longest time.  And 
Tomoyo had missed every single hint.
      She flopped back onto the bed, smiling dreamily.  &quot;Hanyaaaan,&quot; 
she sighed happily.
      And she&#39;d thought *Sakura* was the clueless one.

Author&#39;s Notes:
      I&#39;ve read a few Tomoyo/Sakura fanfics recently, and while many 
of them were quite good, I also noticed a bit of a sameness to a lot 
of them.  Either Tomoyo and Sakura were already a couple, with the 
briefest of explanations, or Sakura found out how Tomoyo felt (often 
through magic), and after a bit of soul-searching, came to 
reciprocate.  Being as perverse by nature as I am, I wondered if 
there wasn&#39;t a different way to approach it.  This is the result.
      I won&#39;t claim this fits perfectly, or even well, with CCS canon. 
I haven&#39;t even seen the whole series or read all the manga at this 
point.  But isn&#39;t it a fun idea? :)
