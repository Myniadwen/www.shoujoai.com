<h1>Tomoyo's Farewell Letter</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kamui.html">Kamui Ikari</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sakura-chan:

It&#39;s the first time that I&#39;ve written a letter to you...
and it will be the last time.

Yes, it&#39;s the first and last time.

I remember the day that I met you for the first time:
you were beautiful, you came to me, and you gave me an
eraser, it was in school.

From that day, things changed.

We became good friends, we did many things together
and I was happy at your side, but I knew that someday
these things won&#39;t happen.

Finally that day came.

It was a five years ago, when you find the Clow Book
and became The Card Captor, the one who must capture
the cards before a disaster would come. I was excited
to have a friend who controls magic and must save the
world. It was the reason that I started to made you
battle costumes and recorded you on video.

And he came too.

He was your rival first and later became your friend
and finally...your beloved.

I&#39;m happy for you, you&#39;d found your happiness and he
returned for you, you two will be forever.

Your brother found his happiness too with him, 
everyone is happy.

Do you remember when I told you something that I will 
explain when you&#39;re older?

I will explain to you.

I care for you, as you care for me, you said that you 
love me, but I don&#39;t love you...in that way.

At the beginning yes, but not now.

You care me as a friend but I don&#39;t care for you in 
that way now.

The truth is:

I&#39;m in love with you, I love you as I never
loved someone before, it&#39;s the true reason
of my demeanor towards you.

But, I&#39;m happy for you, for finding your
&quot;special person&quot;, for finding your true
happiness.

And me?

I don&#39;t know.

I will go to some place, I don&#39;t which
one, but I must do it. It&#39;s painful to
be with you and not having you as I wanted.

I plead you: After you read this, don&#39;t
look for me, don&#39;t try to find me, don&#39;t
waste your time in looking someone like
me, I don&#39;t deserve it.

I won&#39;t see you again....

I&#39;ll never see you again.

Farewell...my love....


Signed: Tomoyo Daidouji


P.S: I will love you until the end of my life
because you are my &quot;special person&quot;.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sakura returned to her home after her date with
Syaoran and found a letter in the floor, it has
no name, she took it and entered her home, and
read it and finally found the reason of why
she was so special to Tomoyo...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Author&#39;s Notes:

1. I&#39;m not good at writing a farewell letter, but at least
   I tried.

2. I could make a lot of stories about Tomoyo and her possible
   destiny. She is my favorite character of CCS. I tried to make
   her letter shorter but still contain her feelings about Sakura.

Okay, that&#39;s all for now.
