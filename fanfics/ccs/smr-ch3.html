<h1>Sailor Moon Remastered (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/smr-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Sometimes the vision was so real it seemed as if it was actually 
happening.

Dreams that tore into her soul as much as how a sharp blade would slice 
through flesh.

She remembers running madly, knowing exactly where she was going yet 
filled with uncertainty about what she would find there. Fear drove her 
right now and made her run that much faster.

When she reached the end, the final door, and threw it open everything 
when white.

She knew there was something past that door that filled her with fear 
-- but she couldn&#39;t bear to see what they&#39;ve done to her --

She was a gentle soul -- a beautiful young woman whose smile warmed her 
heart and made her day a little bit brighter. She was intelligent, abit 
na&iuml;ve at times, and so cute it seemed impossible that anyone would want 
to harm her. It seemed a waste, and a crime, yet somehow she felt that 
they did hurt her --

She burst through the door into the bright light, screaming for her.

Ami-chan -- without her -- without her --

Makoto wakes up with a start, rasping for breath silently, sweat 
rolling down her face.

In her arms, head rested against her breasts, was Ami-chan -- safe and 
sound. Her breath slow and measured and she slept comfortably on top of 
Makoto. Two fingers gently touched Ami&#39;s face, a smile etching across 
Mako&#39;s features as she felt her beloved&#39;s features slowly, being 
careful not to wake her.

She looked like a little angel even in sleep, so peaceful. A brief 
shiver ran down Mako&#39;s spine, her arm hugging Ami-chan a little 
tighter.

It was only a bad vision -- but still, it felt so real.

As sleep retook her all she could think about was Ami-chan -- even as 
she fell back into slumber.

Trinity Towers

Assassin Guilder HQ

As he stood at his office window, staring down towards the Trinity 
Plaza below, he felt a twinge of power nearby -- they were here.

With the recent appearances of Prime Drone units it was only natural 
that the Guild would end up being dragged into the situation (Seeing 
that the Prime Drones were their responsibility in the first place).

A slight movement behind him, and a sense of dread, warned him to his 
guest&#39;s arrival.

&quot;I heard about your recent -- &quot;activities&quot; -- in Tokyo.&quot; Greymalkin 
started, eyes not leaving from his vantage point overlooking the Plaza 
below. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have attacked those girls.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Holocaust grimly said, &quot;Which girls?&quot;

&quot;You know perfectly well what I mean.&quot; Greymalkin countered, spinning 
on his heels to come face to face with his &quot;guest&quot;, stalking towards 
the door with him following, &quot;And don&#39;t proclaim that you&#39;re sorry! 
You&#39;re not sorry, not in the slightest.&quot;

&quot;Maybe that does have a ring of undeniable truth to it --&quot; he 
countered, following Greymalkin out the door, &quot;But I am merely pursuing 
an active target and traitor. You know as well as I do the minute she 
violated Code 13 that her death was inevitable.&quot;

&quot;She was programmed to do so.&quot; the older assassin&#39; shot back, turning 
to face Holocaust as they walked the empty corridor. &quot;Or are you 
claiming that you&#39;re better than she is? Especially in light of --&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not going to start proclaiming that I&#39;m obsessed with her, are 
you?&quot;

&quot;The thought has crossed my mind.&quot; Greymalkin countered as the two 
entered the lift. &quot;Ground floor. It seems rather odd that you are so 
fixated on a girl whose &quot;reward&quot; bounty is in flux due to the 
circumstances of involvement in the liberation of --&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s still grounds to pursue it even if --&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that!&quot; Greymalkin groaned, &quot;I don&#39;t know why your 
obsessed with Trooper Mercury -- it isn&#39;t about Sailor Mercury, is it? 
Because if that&#39;s all I&#39;d be really disappointed in you --&quot;

&quot;No. It&#39;s not about Sailor Mercury.&quot; Holocaust countered. &quot;But enough 
of that. Stick to the plan. Retrieve the 101 &quot;credits&quot; and pay the fee 
for services to be rendered. Right now we need to prepare if what we 
know comes to pass, and you wasting time on a personal vendetta --&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll complete the task within the timeframe given. No problems on 
that.&quot; Holocaust retorts, moving towards the door as they swish open 
only to be stopped by Greymalkin. &quot;Find more truly guilty souls. Don&#39;t 
waste your time on a doubtful entity like Trooper Mercury. If we&#39;re 
going to make the deadline it has to be done soon.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t I always come through for you?&quot; he remarked glibly as he exited 
the lift, with Greymalkin behind. &quot;And what should I do if they inquire 
as to the architect behind these little attacks?&quot;

&quot;Sell me out, Greymalkin.&quot; Holocaust&#39;s retreating form called out, 
&quot;It&#39;s the least you could do.&quot;

Greymalkin&#145;s eyebrows furrowed and his face scrunched. &quot;I wish.&quot;

-----

ChibiUsa was nowhere to be found. She and the younger Hotaru wandered 
out of the park mere moments ago but it seemed like finding a needle in 
a giant field of hay as the two would be searchers surveyed the Trinity 
Towers complex that they wandered into.

&quot;We&#39;ll never find them like this.&quot; Keiko growled, her head snapping 
back and forth as she looked about, &quot;We better split up.&quot;

Older Hotaru (Eve) nodded her head, already heading off in one 
direction, only for Keiko&#39;s hand to stop her. &quot;What? Aren&#39;t we --&quot;

Keiko kisses her. Fully, deeply, with great passion -- then leaves.

Confused, Hotaru(Eve) stands there staring blankly until motivation 
gets her moving again to look for ChibiUsa -- but her thoughts were not 
on the two missing girls.

She could only think of Keiko, and the thing she just did, to the point 
of distraction.

----

&quot;At present the Guilds are looking into several possible sources in 
consideration of the question of whose behind the present attacks by 
Prime Units.&quot; Greymalkin responded, glancing about the Sailor Soldiers 
for reactions. They were in the huge lobby of the central tower. A 
giant makeshift table has been erected here to host the meeting between 
Guilders and Sailor Soldiers.

&quot;Quick.&quot; Greymalkin &quot;thought sent&quot; through his wetware to those 
monitoring, &quot;Tell me I got some reaction out of that.&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; the female &quot;voice&quot; in his head answered, &quot;The reaction was all 
negative. They&#39;d have an easier time believing your Arnold 
Schwarzenegger than what you just told them.&quot;

&quot;---thanks for the vote of confidence---&quot; Greymalkin groaned 
(inwardly), to which the reply was &quot;No prob.&quot;

As he sat down, and another Guilder named Shatterax took over the 
briefing, he glanced wearily at the Soliders. &quot;Break it down for me.&quot;

&quot;Ok--&quot; the voice called out, as he panned his head slowly about. &quot;The 
one known as Sailor Mars seems least taken with your assurances. Seems 
suspicious of you, too.&quot;

&quot;Do you blame her? What about Mercury?&quot;

&quot;Sailor Mercury is listening to what you and Shatterax are saying, and 
weighting it all carefully -- but yet some doubt exists in her from 
what I can see.&quot;

&quot;Sailor Moon is just listening -- looks abit famished. Sailor Jupiter 
is as skeptical as Mars, and keeps glancing at Mercury as if she&#39;s 
worried about her for some reason. Finally, Venus seems to be looking 
off towards the back -- and for good reason --&quot;

&quot;Makomi&#39;s here, watching, right?&quot; Greymalkin asked, to which the reply 
is simply &quot;It seems that way. We&#39;re not picking up her presence but 
she&#39;s good at hiding that as you remember from the data on her.&quot;

&quot;Just out of curiosity -- who supplied the info on her?&quot; Greymalkin 
knew he was going to regret asking -- and he was right. &quot;Holocaust. 
Why?&quot;

&quot;Nothing -- never mind -- I --&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re up, boss.&quot; the female voice pointed out, snapping Greymalkin 
back to reality. &quot;Right.&quot; (stands up) &quot;Where --&quot;

&quot;The spiel about assassins being killers.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; (speaks out loud) &quot;But as you know, despite the fact that we 
keep a tight and orderly ship here and abide to a strict Code of 
conduct, we are still killers. Assassins are, after all, murderers by 
nature. In our century (after the Great War of the 24th Century) there 
was a void to fill --&quot;

-----

What are the girls thinking right now?

Usagi - &quot;---when are they going to feed us?&quot;

Rei - &quot;Stupid Usagi&#39;s probably thinking of food again! I just fed her 
this morning and there she goes thinking about food again! It&#39;s not 
like I let her starve but NO she&#39;s always thinking about food and 
eating and going on and on about lunch or dinner and food food food -- 
ugh, I&#39;m hungry now. I wonder if Mako-chan is going to make us lunch or 
dinner after this --&quot;

Makoto - &quot;Is Ami really listening to all of this? She looks so focused 
-- I wish I was that smart -- (-_-)&quot; (thinks about seducing Ami-chan in 
bed while using big words, classical music and intelligent banter 
during lovemaking)

Ami - (complex thoughts as she focuses, occasionally riddled with 
images of her giving Mako-chan a champagne bubblebath with trays of 
food and lovemaking)

Minako - &quot;Why did I blindy yank the bowl out of the microwave and eat 
Artemis&#39; cat food -- again? It&#145;s not like my senses are deadened to the 
point I can&#145;t tell catfood apart from pate&#145; -- but it tastes so good 
and --&quot;

-----

&quot;-- a need if you will.&quot; Greymalkin went on, oblivious to the interlude 
we just had to look into the girl&#39;s heads, &quot;Someone&#39;s petty Colony 
Dictator has a taste for village girls? Solved with a plasma shot 
through the head. Somebody&#39;s flooding the streets of your hometown in 
&quot;black snow&quot;? Cut off the supply line of drugs by cutting the head off 
the serpent that is spewing the poison. Somebody&#39;s been a naughty boy? 
A &quot;gentleman&quot; perhaps? Bullet through the head is a sure-fire cure all. 
We don&#39;t fix the social problems of the galaxy -- we just lessen the 
burden on it by killing a few people here and there. And if it turns a 
profit then who are we to complain?&quot;

&quot;Gentlemen?&quot; Usagi asked, confused. Then again, quite a few of the 
girls were confused by this reference.

&quot;Gentlemen -- Gentlemen --&quot; (Greymalkin sighs) &quot;--haven&#39;t you ever 
watched &quot;Alpha Quadrant&#39;s Most Wanted&quot;?&quot; (Mako and Rei&#39;s hand goes up, 
Rei speaking) &quot;Gentlemen are the &quot;name&quot; of men who conduct crimes 
against children of a sexual nature.&quot;

&quot;Correct.&quot; (Greymalkin points at Rei in a vigorous manner), &quot;You get a 
cookie.&quot; (Rei doesn&#39;t look pleased with the older Assassin&#39;s banter, 
while Usagi mutters &quot;Cookie&quot; and goes glassy eyed -- so he cuts to the 
chase) &quot;The point is that we&#39;re as helpful as we can be, but we&#39;re 
killers -- and, last I checked, there was some doubt to whether or not 
Trooper Mercury had a mark on her head in lieu of circumstances from 
several years ago.&quot;

Before anyone could speak Shatterax cut them off with &quot;But it IS 
several years old, and probably not active anymore. In that case it&#39;s 
simple villainy. Remove the heroine that stands in the way of evil 
plots -- or perhaps simple yet misguided &quot;vengeance&quot; for her becoming 
good.&quot;

Suddenly, and for no reason, Usagi stands straight up and announces &quot;I 
can solve that easily!&quot;

Both assassins exchange worried glances, before looking back at her, 
&quot;And how will you do that?&quot;

From her pocket she products her old Transformation (disguise) Pen and 
morphs into --

&quot;Trooper Mercury?&quot; Shatterax mutters, confused by the change. Sailor 
Moon, embolden by her &quot;idea&quot; quickly rushes straight towards the 
outside. &quot;I&#39;ll see who shoots at me first!&quot;

&quot;W-w-wHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?&quot; Greymalkin yelled, mostly at Usagi&#39;s 
retreating back as she rushed outside to enact her &quot;Great Plan&quot;.

&quot;Is she going to be alright?&quot; Ami asked, blushing, to which Rei growled 
&quot;WHO GIVES A DAMN! USAGI YOU MORON!!&quot; (goes after Usagi).

Greymalkin falls back into his chair and sighs, &quot;I knew I should have 
went to law school -- well, I guess we can order in something while --&quot; 
(everyone else goes after the two) &quot;-- should have stood in bed today.&quot;

With great reluctance he stands up and follows.

-----

Rei, fuming so much it looked as if steam was about to come out of her 
head, chased after Usagi.

&quot;USAKO!! Stop runn--&quot;

As she wound the corner about a statue two hands grabbed her and yanked 
her into the statue, Usagi&#39;s eyes meeting her&#39;s, a mischievous smile on 
her lips.

Rei, blushing now, stared at her with wide eyes, &quot;W-wh-what?!? What is 
-- ww--&quot;

Usagi moved closer, eyes wide, and said quietly, &quot;There&#39;s a naked 
statue of you behind you.&quot;

Rei, face turning bright red, growled &quot;NO THERE ISN&#39;T!! I--&quot; (spins) 
&quot;--ACK!!&quot;

Sure enough there was a naked female statue behind her, touching 
herself in a rather provocative manner, with the dubious plaque of 
&quot;Priestess Rei Hino Nude in Moonlight&quot; printed out on the metal stand 
by -- it couldn&#39;t have been, but she looked so much like Rei that -- 
&quot;THAT BASTARD!!&quot; Rei growled, eyes burning bright red, fists clenched.

&quot;Guess your plan to switch him from singer to sculptor backfired! But I 
always knew he had dirty thoughts about you forever and ever!&quot; Usagi 
cried out cheerfully, prancing away leaving Rei shocked where she was. 
&quot;The -- the -- the bastard -- I --&quot; (looks at plaque again) &quot;--wait -- 
this is --&quot; (pulls paper off of plaque to reveal &quot;Winterian Goddess of 
Love and Pleasure&quot; wording beneath, causing Rei to explode after 
recovering from her initial anger)

That&#39;s right -- she remembers now that Usagi been there once -- their 
school had an Art Appreciation trip to this complex once and Usagi was 
there -- she had been planning this for probably ages and finally she 
got to do it -- she knew it was suspicious when Usagi insisted on 
taking her backpack with her to the meeting!

&quot;USAKO YOU BITCH!!&quot;

----

&quot;What are they doing?!&quot; Mako grumbles, fists clenched as she follows 
next to Ami, &quot;Are they nuts??&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s going to be alright, right? I mean -- Rei isn&#145;t going to --&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s going to get herself hurt that way -- Rei that is, Usagi&#39;s head 
is hard as stone sometimes. Honestly!&quot;

&quot;Maybe we should walk faster. &quot;Ami noted, watching Rei chase Usagi 
through the exhibits of artwork faster and faster. However, someone 
behind them had a different notion of what they should do.

Greymalkin, breathing heavily, races up behind them, &quot;Bio-tech or no 
bio-tech, I can&#39;t take it if you walk faster -- slow down!&quot;

Usagi seemed more interested in browsing the huge art exhibit in the 
hallway (as Trooper Mercury) than going outside, while Rei seemed 
intent on killing Usagi. The two just seemed to bounce from one huge 
exhibit to the next, Usagi ogling all the huge sculptures as Rei tried 
to catch her.

The other Soldiers and Shatterax followed close behind her, trying to 
calm her down. That&#39;s when they all came to a halt at the sound of the 
music. Even Rei, who managed to calm down once the music started.

Sad music floated through the hallways, catching the attention of all 
who heard it. Quickly heads shifted from the left, to the right, as 
everyone looked about for the source.

&quot;Makomi.&quot; Ami whispered, to which Greymalkin said &quot;No.&quot; (this catches 
all the Sailor Soldiers attentions -- those in earshot -- as all eyes 
falling on him as he speaks) &quot;Makomi plays a guitar, remember? That&#39;s 
not the sound of a guitar -- more like someone --&quot; (walks off in one 
direction) &quot;-- playing a violin.&quot;

The multiple footfalls behind meant that they were all following in 
unison behind, making a form of makeshift &quot;parade&quot; following the sound 
of the violin -- until it lead them to the ground level landing pad for 
shuttle craft (presently filled with one tech shuttle). There, standing 
near the shuttle quietly playing her instrument was -- &quot;And you must be 
Sailor Neptune.&quot; Greymalkin noted, watching her play.

As she turned her head, a glint of metal caught the old assassin&#39;s eye. 
&quot;And I see you &quot;bought&quot; company.&quot;

It took a few seconds but the girls finally noticed what caught his 
attention. There, clipped over one of Michiru&#39;s ears, was a cam-clip (a 
portable holo-camera for surveillance work).

&quot;I&#39;ll take it the warm &quot;soul&quot; on the opposite end of the link is one 
Trooper Mercury --&quot; (glances over at Usagi who was now blushing and 
fidgeting in her &quot;disguise&quot;) &quot;-- the REAL Trooper Mercury.&quot;

&quot;Correct.&quot; the landing pad&#39;s loudspeakers boomed. &quot;Just keeping an eye 
on you from a safe distance.&quot;

The other Sailor Soldiers stood just staring, except for Ami who asked 
&quot;Where are you?&quot;

&quot;Oh, she&#39;s nearby --&quot; Greymalkin answered, arm raised with finger 
pointing off towards one of the other towers in the backdrop, &quot;Just 
watching us for the past few minutes. Venus noticed her first.&quot;

Minako paled at the mention of her &quot;name&quot;.

A blur drops out from one side, falling in front of Michiru. Greymalkin 
doesn&#39;t react to it. &quot;And YOU, you must be Sailor Uranus.&quot;

The two exchange brief glances, sizing the other up, before the old 
assassin speaks again, &quot;Yamanaka didn&#39;t say anything about surprise 
guests. So, what&#39;s the deal?&quot;

&quot;Your not telling us everything, are you.&quot;

His face fell abit into a frown, though he held his temper in check, 
&quot;Now there&#39;s an unwarranted accusation if I ever heard one. You think 
I&#39;m not saying all there is to say? Prove it.&quot;

&quot;Maybe I will.&quot; Uranus whispers, slowly stepping back towards Michiru, 
watching the two assassins carefully. &quot;I see all --&quot; the loudspeakers 
said, &quot;-- and I know you were talking with him, weren&#39;t you.&quot;

Of course. Give the devil her due, after all. She was being quite the 
observant one today.

&quot;If you know so much then why don&#39;t you just come out and say it 
already.&quot; Greymalkin shot at his invisible critic, his gaze turning 
away from the Outer Planet duo and focused dead on Makomi&#39;s location, 
&quot;Or are you just fishing for information?&quot;

Silence. The loudspeakers sat quietly, as did the girls, as they waited 
for a reply.

A reply that never came.

A young man in assassin&#39; guild armor rushed up to Greymalkin, catching 
his attention. &quot;VENGEANCE HAS JUST ARRIVED IN THE MAIN COMPLEX! HE&#39;S 
HEADING THIS WAY!&quot;

&quot;What?! DAMMIT!&quot; Greymalkin hissed, spinning on his heels towards the 
girls, &quot;Get them out of here--&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on!!&quot; (Rei)

&quot;Who??&quot; (Mako)

&quot;Where are--&quot; (Minako)

&quot;What&#39;s going on??&quot; (Usagi)

&quot;We have guest.&quot; Greymalkin growled, angry as heck, &quot;Guest of the 
perverted type -- no doubt a Prime Drone sent to cause havok -- how 
many --&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s being engaged now.&quot;

Sounds of gunfire echoed through the huge outdoor landing pad from 
inside the building. &quot;Drone Units are engaged, but he isn&#39;t easy to 
take down as you know.&quot;

Greymalkin pushed his way past the girls, motioning for the two to 
follow him. &quot;To the Armory, quickly -- AND SOMEBODY GET THEM OUT OF 
HERE!!&quot;

But he might as well have not have said it, there was nobody around to 
hear his orders or carry them out, leaving the girls to their own 
devices concerning the situation at hand.

-----

Walking in circles for what seemed like forever, Older Hotaru (Eve) 
finally had to rest.

She collapsed against a wall, and sighed. It was as if those two were 
just filled with boundless energy because once they vanished they 
seemingly made it a point to stay vanished.

&quot;Maybe -- (gasp gasp) -- they really ARE doing it -- in public -- (gasp 
gasp) --&quot;

A shape of someone standing several feet in front of her catches her 
eye, bringing her attention up. &quot;Excuse me! Have you seen two young --&quot;

Her voice stopped. Her eyes froze wide open. Her body trembled.

There, dressed in a flowing white gown was ChibiUsa -- her ChibiUsa -- 
deathly pale, eyes gone -- her hands reaching out towards --

&quot;NO!!!&quot; Hotaru screamed, burying herself into a fetal position crying 
&quot;GOAWAYGOAWAYGOAWAY!!&quot;

She stood there for minutes, rocking, afraid to even look up -- lest 
she be there, staring through empty eye sockets at her -- her fear 
consuming her whole as she shivered and shook there all curled up.

&quot;Hey? You OK big sister? Are you hurt?&quot;

&quot;NOPLEASEDONTTOUCHHURTME!!&quot; she screamed, her words jumbling as she 
shrieked, her body quaking in fear. &quot;Please go away! I&#39;m sorry -- 
goddess I&#39;m sorry -- what they did -- goddess the pain -- make it stop 
-- please goddess make it stop --&quot;

ChibiUsa recoiled back from Older Hotaru, uncertain what to say. 
Besides her, younger Hotaru looked on confused. She didn&#39;t know what to 
say at the moment, not to Older Hotaru/Eve, and not to ChibiUsa who was 
confused as to what she did wrong now.

&quot;CHIBIUSA!!&quot; a voice called out, causing her to frown. &quot;Damn.&quot;

&quot;What are you doing here?!?&quot; Usagi growled, still dressed up as Trooper 
Mercury, waving a finger at her. &quot;I thought you were going to the park 
today dammit! I --&quot;

&quot;USAGI!!!&quot; Rei screamed behind her, bringing her back to reality. As 
Rei rushed up to her she noticed Older Hotaru, and her anger melted 
quickly -- apparently people finally did show up to shoo the girls out 
of the building -- but not before Usagi flipped up Rei&#39;s skirt (after 
she whacked Usagi in the head) which prompted this chase out of the 
building in the first place --

Meanwhile, back in the main plaza ---

Makoto frowned, &quot;Those two are like little kids.&quot;

Minako sighed. &quot;The least they could have done was feed us.&quot;

Makoto and Ami sighed.

Back to the group.

As Rei scooped Older Hotaru (Eve) into her arms, she cried out &quot;Please 
don&#39;t!! Don&#39;t!! Stop!!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright! It&#39;s me, Rei! Come on -- open your eyes -- Hotaru-chan 
-- open your eyes --&quot;

Slowly, reluctantly, she did, coming face to face with Rei&#39;s warm 
smiling face. &quot;You OK?&quot; she asked, receiving a slow but reassuring nod 
from the other Hotaru. Rei&#39;s arms encompassed the young woman, drawing 
her close to hug her as she shivered in her touch. &quot;It&#39;s alright, don&#39;t 
be afraid, it&#39;s alright.&quot;

Usagi, now miffed at Rei, spins on ChibiUsa and Hotaru, though all her 
anger focused on ChibiUsa. &quot;What are you doing here! I thought you were 
going to be at the amusement park you parasite and here you are!&quot;

&quot;For your information the hat Hotaru-chan bought me was lost and I had 
to retrieve it! And why aren&#39;t you sneaking into --&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s none of your business you pink fluff ball! Why are you such a 
retard anyway?!?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your fault I&#39;m like this, I have your defective DNA in me, so 
blame yourself!!&quot;

&quot;WHAT DID YOU --?!?&quot;

Younger Hotaru just stood there, uncertain what to do.

As for Older Hotaru? The argument seemed light years away in Rei&#39;s arms 
-- but as she looked into her eyes she felt as if Keiko was there -- 
lovingly rocking her -- whispering words of encouragement -- loving her 
--

&quot;REI!&quot;

Miffed, Rei turns her head only to notice -- &quot;You&#39;re crystals -- 
they&#39;re --&quot;

Both Silver Imperium Crystals were glowing -- something was nearby.

Something behind them creaked and groaned. Their eyes turning towards a 
strange sight -- a rather strange angel. A man dressed in a black 
uniform, metallic wings of red metal draped over his shoulders, stood 
on the far side of the huge space they were in -- that&#39;s when it hit 
them where they were.

So intent on their own concerns that they missed that they were 
standing in the place where, in their reality, the Tomoe Research Labs 
should have been -- but now, in this place, stood a huge reflecting 
pool with a giant monument to Ravens past with three dozen statues 
standing on a giant platform in the middle of the pool. There, standing 
between two statues, was the strange &quot;angel&quot; in question.

Older Hotaru was the last to see it, her gaze finally rising upwards 
from her crushed weakened position, her face faulting as she gazed upon 
him. Last to see him, first to recognize him.

&quot;---von hammer---&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Rei muttered, looking quickly at Older Hotaru before turning her 
gaze back to the strange winged male. Beside Rei, Older Hotaru(Eve) 
spoke again in a low hushed whisper, &quot;Von Hammer, the Rogue Judgment of 
Heaven -- tricky bastard -- be mindful of his wing knives and his 
lightning fast speed.&quot;

At this Von Hammer raised a hand and slowly clicked one finger back and 
forth in a chiding manner, &quot;Naughty naughty, mustn&#39;t squeal --&quot; 
(smiles) &quot;-- lest one might be compelled to retribute in turn. One 
secret for another -- my fatal Adam-like flaw for yours --&quot;

Older Hotaru clenched her teeth, and braced herself.

She didn&#39;t need to hear more to know what he was hinting at. The 
bastard saw right through her -- he always did -- and he was going to 
use it against her -- again.

----

Meanwhile --

It continued to walk forward, but it&#39;s paced slowed as it was 
continuously hammered from several sides by heavy gunfire. The drone 
unit&#39;s armor was cracking, holes breaking into the hard metal allowing 
shots to pierce the cloned flesh beneath. It staggered, but continued 
to stroll forward.

If anything could be said of this drone unit, it was hard to kill.

Suddenly, Greymalkin&#39;s commlink went off. &quot;FINISH IT QUICKLY! IT&#39;S A 
DECOY!&quot; the voice on the link screamed. &quot;What?!?&quot; Greymalkin rasped in 
reply, chucking another plasma grenade through the launcher on his 
rifle at the Drone, stunning it. &quot;What do you---&quot;

&quot;VON HAMMER&#39;S OUTSIDE! THAT THING&#39;S A DISTRACTION!!&quot;

&quot;FUCK!&quot; he growled, pulling a heavy duty pulse launcher from one 
guilder&#39;s back. &quot;We&#39;ve been had!!&quot; he screams, aiming it at the 
stumbling drone, &quot;Clear out and leave the clean up to the repair 
staff!&quot;

With that he clicked down the launch button, and in a brilliant flash 
of light that filled his vision for a second, the shiny metal 
projectile launched itself right into the drone. &quot;Everybody outside, 
now!&quot; he yelled, already running for the doors as it hit, turning the 
entire lobby into a fiery explosion, shattering the glass windows all 
the way across the lobby in one giant whoosh of air and fire.

Greymalkin was last out, shoved out the glass doors as they shattered 
behind him, knocked about by the force of the blast. As the guilders 
picked themselves up, one of them pointed towards one direction 
&quot;Sensors are picking up something that way!&quot;

-----

Whizz! Whizz! Whizz! Whizz!

Four arrows buried themselves dead center in Von Hammer&#39;s chest, 
knocking the dark creature backwards. From behind the soft thrum of a 
sad song could be heard.

&quot;About time.&quot; Rei grumbled, yanking her transformation pen out. &quot;Let&#39;s 
morph!&quot;

Usagi, ChibiUsa and Hotaru followed suit with Older Hotaru (Eve) 
refusing to move from her spot.

&quot;Mars Dreaming Power, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;Moon Dreaming Power, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;Chibi-Moon Dreaming Power, MAKE UP!&quot;

&quot;Saturn Dreaming Power, MAKE UP!&quot;

As they transform a bad thought goes through Usagi&#39;s head, one she 
can&#39;t wait to emphasis on once they finish changing. &quot;In the name of 
love and Justice! The Sailor suited -- HEY WAIT A MINUTE!!&quot; (turns on 
ChibiUsa) &quot;Since when did YOU get your tool upgraded?!?&quot;

&quot;Yesterday! (bida!) Selfish! You could have told me you were doing it 
but nooo! You&#39;re greedy!&quot;

&quot;You stupid pink--&quot; (Rei hits Usagi upside the head) &quot;Do you mind 
finishing already &quot;Sailor Moo&quot;!!&quot;

Usagi, grumbling, turns back towards the enemy and finishes. &quot;The 
Sailor Suited Pretty Soldier, Sailor Moon is here! (Sailor Moo! Hmph!)&quot;

&quot;And so is Sailor Saturn and Sailor Chibi-Moo--&quot; (SMACK!) &quot;OW!! 
USAGI!!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what you get for being a para--&quot; (SMACK) &quot;REI!!&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you two just yell out EVERYTHING about us already!!&quot; Rei 
growled, silencing the two.

Hotaru, uncertain of what to do next, simply pointed at herself and 
said &quot;I&#39;m Hot---&quot; (ChibiUsa quickly covers her mouth before she can say 
anymore).

From a corner of her line of sight, flashes of red, snapping Rei&#39;s 
attention into focus as she screams &quot;GET DOWN!!&quot;, her body quickly 
shoving the other three Soldiers down as a rain of crimson wing blades 
whistles overhead.

Keiko barely has enough time to get to Older Hotaru (Eve), shoving her 
down as the blades shoot over them. But Usagi was already in motion, 
grabbing her new staff and holding it forward chanting out --

Rei - &quot;What are you doing?!? Stop that thing before it kills us!!&quot;

Silence, then Usagi spins about and shrugs, &quot;I forgot to ask what the 
new words for this thing is!!&quot;

Rei collapses onto the pavement.

Behind her, Makomi and Keiko rush forward to meet Von Hammer head on, 
the two clashing together fists and bladed swords at him, swinging hard 
and fast. As they fight it out Usagi holds the staff up, looking at it, 
&quot;Maybe the words are inscribed on the handle.&quot;

&quot;WHAT kind of IDIOT does that -- oh, right, you.&quot; Rei growls, still 
face down.

Before Usagi can retort in turn, a small BEEP stops her in her tracks. 
The staff begins to speak.

&quot;--is this thing -- it&#39;s on? You sure? It&#39;s -- ok, it&#39;s blinking so -- 
oh -- Hiiiii! If you&#39;re listening to this then your trying to use the 
new Moon Dreams Staff (copyrighted 2003 by &quot;Dream Goddesses Unlimited&quot;, 
&quot;The right major babe for the right job!&quot;) and I just realized that I 
didn&#39;t even talk about this, let alone leave you instructions! Silly 
me. OK! All you have to do is hold it out, concentrate, and yell out 
--&quot; (clears throat) &quot;-- DREAMING MOON PLANET SHOCKWAVE!&quot; (giggles) &quot;I 
thought of it myself! Cute, huh?&quot;

Usagi blushes, Rei no doubt glaring at her from behind. &quot;That&#39;s that. 
Now go get &#145;em! -- heh, it&#39;s one of my better catchphrase lines if I do 
say so myself! After all, sometimes we got to use our brains now and 
again -- so Usagi&#39;s doomed, I guess, but -- DAMN!! Is this still 
recording!? Now I have to erase that last part an---&quot;

Usagi had to hurry. Rei was now near death!

&quot;I&#39;m--- I&#39;m going to -- PWHAAAHHH -- die laugh -- laugh -- BWAH -- 
laughing!!&quot; Rei choked out, a large fit of the giggles overtaking her. 
Usagi glares at Rei. &quot;YOU&#39;RE MEAN!&quot; (turns towards fight) &quot;Everybody 
get clear! It&#39;s Moon Action Time!&quot;

Dramatic pose, dramatic words -- it would have been even more dramatic 
if Sailor Mars wasn&#39;t rolling on the ground behind her laughing her 
head off. With a wide swing Sailor Moon spun about as she cried out the 
activation words, making sure to whack Rei on the head as she did. 
&quot;DREAMING MOON PLANET SHOCKWAVE!!&quot;

As she stopped and thrust the staff forward a bright light shot out, 
which became a thunderous shockwave of pure soul energy. Makomi jumps 
clear, but Keiko grapples Von Hammer from behind (pinning his wings 
down) &quot;OH NO YOU DON&#39;T!! NO FLYING AWAY!! YOU&#39;RE STAYING RIGHT HERE!!&quot;

Before he could argue the wave was upon them, and as the shockwave hit 
there was a scream, silence, and something fell.

&quot;KEI-CHAN!!&quot; Older Hotaru half screamed, stumbling upward onto her 
feet. It took a few seconds for the smoke to clear, but it was clear 
that Keiko survived the blast -- but was affected by it. She was knelt 
down on her knees shaken, her eyes abit dimmed as she tried to shake 
off the effects of the shockwave, her sword falling free of her shaken 
and weakened hand clattering onto the ground.

Older Hotaru (Eve) rushed up to her, crying, as she checked her out. 
&quot;WHY DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!?&quot; she screamed at Usagi, &quot;KEI-CHAN&#39;S HURT 
BECAUSE OF YOU!!&quot;

&quot;---but I---&quot; Usagi stammered, only to be stopped by Keiko (hand 
raised) &quot;It&#39;s alright -- just dazed --&quot;

&quot;Kei-chan?&quot; Older Hotaru rasped, eyes tearing up, &quot;I--&quot; her voice fades 
as Keiko presses a few fingers gently to her lips to shush her. &quot;It&#39;ll 
take more than that to put me down --&quot; (pitches forward into her arms) 
&quot;--ugh -- so tired though--&quot;

Her uniform felt wet, as if something was -- quickly she peeled Keiko&#39;s 
top off to reveal several slashes on her arms and upper body where 
feather blades cut into her. 

As for Von Hammer? He was gone, but --

&quot;He&#39;s not dead -- if you&#39;re wondering --&quot; Keiko rasped, turning towards 
the Sailor Soldiers as she spoke, &quot;He&#39;s just gone somewhere to lick his 
wounds and heal his damaged pride. We&#39;ll see him again -- in about 10 
or so years since he doesn&#39;t like to see me more than once a decade.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Usagi whispers -- the whole meaning of Keiko&#39;s words missing her 
head by a mile.

By the time reinforcements arrived the fight was over, but not the 
questions.

Suddenly there was movement and everyone turned and looked.

The sight that greeted them confused them, and unfortunately none of 
them were carrying cameras at the moment -- but, then again, they 
didn&#39;t need to.

As for Keiko? All she noticed was that Older Hotaru&#39;s touch was healing 
her. Her wounds closed, and a calming feeling overwhelmed her. It was 
as if all the stress and pain just washed away under her soft touch. 
Putting her top back on she felt the torn material, &quot;Looks like another 
uniform bites the dust. I --&quot;

Before she can say another word, Older Hotaru throws herself into 
Keiko&#39;s arms, smothering her. She quickly grasps the younger girl and 
holds her, smiling, &quot;Come on, come on already! I&#39;m OK -- you&#39;re such a 
bundle of nerves right now it&#39;s scary!&quot;

From behind they heard the sound of heavy thudding footsteps and a cry 
&quot;KEIKO! Are you--?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m fine.&quot; she smiled, waving Greymalkin off with a silly 
smile and a quick retort, &quot;I&#39;d ask you to join in but I&#39;m in no 
condition for a group hug, thanks ever so.&quot;

----

Keiko went to gather up Sakura and Tomoyo, the other Soliders separated 
to find their ways home for dinner, leaving Older Hotaru behind with 
Michiru and Haruka. She sat down on the smooth stonework near a large 
fountain, breath rasping abit.

&quot;You OK, Hotaru?&quot; Haruka asked with interest, leaning forward, &quot;You 
need to re--&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m just -- worn, that&#39;s all -- it&#39;s been a long day.&quot; she 
responded, her body shivering -- but not from the cold that was slowly 
setting in as the sun set.

Keiko kissed her. Touched her softly as she would when she was Eve.

Nothing sexual, or explicit, but she -- she was responding to her form 
as Hotaru now -- why?

&quot;Want to talk about it?&quot; Michiru offered, to which she scowled. &quot;Why 
can&#39;t you understand?&quot; she grumbled, standing up as she did, &quot;You can 
wish for me to be Hotaru forever and ever, but I&#39;m not Hotaru anymore. 
All of this --&quot; (holds up hands) &quot;-- isn&#39;t me. I don&#39;t want to be 
Hotaru, the only reason I became Hotaru is because --&quot;

&quot;You missed having a family.&quot; Michiru finished, drawing a scornful look 
from Eve/Hotaru. &quot;If you were my family you&#39;d accept me for who I am!!&quot;

And, with that, she turned and ran off towards where Keiko would be 
waiting for her.

-----

She checked the pots again, looked over the stove, checked everything 
over and over again.

She was meticulous, and quite detailed in her work -- but when it came 
to cooking she was overtly cautious. If Mako-chan checked it once, she 
would check it twice. If it required such and such a time she would 
monitor over it like a hawk and make sure she didn&#39;t give anything less 
than the time it needed to cook. Experimentation was a word she dreaded 
in the kitchen, because it meant another chance to botch a simple 
recipe and fail in cooking.

She was fair in her skills, but compared to Mako-chan&#39;s her skills were 
minor at best.

Still, Ami-chan tried hard to cook her best for Mako when it was her 
turn.

As she turned off the stove, and leaned back to take a deep breath, she 
felt two reassuring arms wrap about her and draw her close. Soft lips 
kissed her shoulder, and a reassuring presence comforted her and calmed 
her. &quot;I&#39;m done.&quot; she sighed, checking one more time.

&quot;It smells wonderful.&quot; Mako-chan whispered, kissing the back of Ami&#39;s 
neck as she nuzzled her head against her&#39;s, &quot;You&#39;re becoming quite the 
little whiz in the kitchen.&quot;

&quot;Thanks to you, with all your help and teaching -- being so patient 
with me.&quot; she admitted, pushing Mako-chan back enough to start making 
plate, &quot;I hope you approve of the taste as you do it&#39;s smell.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure I will. And it&#145;s very easy to be patient with such an apt 
pupil!&quot; she replied, waiting anxiously for her plate, &quot;If I knew years 
ago we were so compatible I&#39;d never have chased so many boys!&quot; (makes a 
vwhooshing sound and shoots one hand forward as visual aid) &quot;I would 
have went straight for you right at the start and saved myself a ton of 
grief!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t joke like that --&quot; Ami whispered, only to feel those same lips 
kiss her shoulder, &quot;I&#39;m not kidding.&quot;

As they sat down to eat, and after the flurry of compliments from 
Mako-chan, Ami asked the question that had been bugging her since they 
left the Assassin Guild&#39; HQ.

&quot;Will we ever find peace? True, lasting peace -- or just the peace that 
lasts for a brief time before the next enemy appears?&quot;

Makoto thought about it, then shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t know, Ami -- I 
wish I did.&quot;

As they ate, Ami asked another question. &quot;Did Hotaru seem -- stressed 
to you today? Older Hotaru, I mean.&quot;

&quot;She did seem rather attached today to that woman -- what&#39;s her name? 
Reiko?&quot;

&quot;Keiko Yamanaka, the 7th Judgment --&quot; (Ami&#39;s eyes narrowed in thought) 
&quot;-- speaking of which --&quot;

-----

She couldn&#39;t change back to Eve. Keiko was too diligent, watching her 
for her own safety.

She refused to let the weakened Eve/Hotaru leave in her condition. She 
laid next to her in the bed they shared as Keiko/Eve and watched over 
her. Her breathing was abit labored as she tried to rest, but couldn&#39;t 
from the stress of being so close to Keiko. So close and yet -- &quot;You 
sure you don&#39;t want me to call a doctor? I know a really good one --&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s OK.&quot; she whispered, uncomfortable with the idea of a doctor 
prodding her, &quot;I&#39;ll heal.&quot;

Suddenly Keiko moved forward, wrapping her arms about Eve/Hotaru, &quot;You 
have to relax or you&#39;ll never fall asleep. Eve called and said she 
can&#39;t make it home tonight so it&#39;s just us girls minding the store 
while she&#39;s gone, is that OK?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Eve/Hotaru sighed, knowing fully well she came up with that 
ruse once she realized Keiko wasn&#39;t going to give her the chance to 
slip away to change back to Eve. She turned, wanting to break free of 
Keiko&#39;s grip -- then stopped. Suddenly, for some reason, she felt as if 
she didn&#39;t want to break her hold. In fact -- it seemed so very right 
for Keiko to hold her regardless of what form she held.

So she simply sank deeper into Keiko&#39;s touch, and relented herself to 
her loving feelings that she may or may not have had for Hotaru. As she 
relented, her breathing slowed and she calmed down.

&quot;See?&quot; she whispered, &quot;If I hold you tight you&#39;ll just calm right down 
-- and fall asleep.&quot;

&quot;But -- Eve --&quot;

Two fingers press against her lips, and silence her. &quot;Go to sleep.&quot;

As she closed her eyes she felt so warm -- so comfortable --

&quot;I&#39;m scared --&quot; she thought, &quot;-- I can&#39;t fall in love with Keiko -- in 
this form -- it&#39;s wrong.&quot;

&quot;I never used to think Keiko could have feelings for me in this form -- 
but if she does -- then I&#39;ll have to tell her the truth -- and she&#39;ll 
hate me forever for lying to her.&quot;

As she drifted to restful slumber in Keiko&#39;s arms, she thought &quot;How 
long can I keep this charade going?&quot;

&quot;How long do I want to keep this feeling in my heart going?&quot;

----

Sailor Trooper HQ -- the next day.

The images from Makomi&#39;s wetware, from what she &quot;saw&quot; the minute she 
spun about and looked at that moment, was enough. It was clear despite 
her agitated spin and quick glancing towards the fleeing forms.

Two forms. Clear as day on the screen before them.

Two Assassin Guilders were watching them from afar. At first the girls 
thought it was the enemy.

The tech officer on duty in the Command Center shot down that idea in 
an instant.

&quot;Sorry folks, but as they say in my circles? &quot;You&#39;ve been played&quot;.&quot; 
(brings a close up and pulls two files) &quot;Quake (the tall blonde female) 
and Technocrat (the shorter dark haired male). Assassin Guild. 
Obviously there watching over the proceedings on the behest of a 
certain requestor.&quot;

As everyone&#39;s thoughts raced, Makomi was the first to realize where 
they were going with said thoughts. &quot;WAIT! Just because Keiko possibly 
asked for them to observe doesn&#39;t mean--&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; Usagi shot out, turning on Makomi, &quot;She&#39;s the one who 
set everything up! And that old guy really knew her rather well!&quot;

FLASHBACK - Both Greymalkin and Haruka sized each other up, glancing 
briefly at the other, before the old assassin speaks again, &quot;Yamanaka 
didn&#39;t say anything about surprise guests. So, what&#39;s the deal?&quot;

FLASHBACK - From behind they heard the sound of heavy thudding 
footsteps and a cry of a familiar &quot;KEIKO! Are you--?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m fine.&quot; she smiled, waving Greymalkin off with a silly 
smile and a quick retort, &quot;I&#39;d ask you to join in but I&#39;m in no 
condition for a group hug, thanks ever so.&quot;

&quot;Does this mean she may be our enemy?&quot; Makoto asked, bringing a furious 
&quot;PAPA!&quot; from Makomi.

&quot;Will we see these two again?&quot; Rei asked, taking a close look at the 
two&#39;s images.

Minako, however, wasn&#39;t content to let the subject drop at this point, 
in fact she was just warming up.

&quot;It&#39;s as if she&#39;s looming over everything that&#39;s going on. She has 
connections with everything, including the people we&#39;re supposed to be 
suspicious of! Ever since we started to investigate these &quot;Drone&quot; 
things she&#39;s been a part of it!&quot;

This only made Makomi angry, which quickly set Ami to her side to try 
and calm her. As for Minako? She finished by saying &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter 
if they&#39;re friend or foe, I know we&#39;ll see them again if Keiko has her 
way.&quot;

&quot;You should be very careful.&quot; the tech officer informed her, to which 
she nodded her head.

&quot;So we&#39;re going to start becoming suspicious of our own friends now?&quot; 
Makomi challenged. &quot;Who else are we going to start pointing suspicions 
towards?&quot;

The obvious.

Greymalkin. Despite his assurances to the contrary, he fell into the 
list of suspects.

And, of course, Keiko, who they suspected from the start of this 
meeting.

&quot;You don&#39;t know she&#39;s involved! It&#39;s only speculation that she&#39;s done 
anything wrong --&quot; Makomi challenges, a sneer growing on her face, &quot;Or 
is it no longer innocent until proven guilty?&quot;

To this Ami said &quot;You&#39;re right. It&#39;s too soon to throw blame around 
needlessly, and without cause -- but still, we should at least be 
careful about her.&quot;

Seconds pass, but finally Makomi relents and simply nods her head in 
reply, giving up trying to reason with them now that they had their 
minds set on this.

So they all left, agreeing that none of what they said in there would 
leave that room.

The tech officer simply nods her head, and leans back in her chair 
running a hand through her green hair.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you can count on me.&quot; Nina Kotobuki said as she watched 
them leave. As the doors swooshed closed she picked up her commlink and 
clicked it open. &quot;Hi, Keiko -- guess what.&quot;

-----

Assassin Guilder HQ (a minute earlier)

&quot;HOW the HELL did Von Hammer get into the complex!!&quot; Greymalkin 
screamed, his eyes narrowing as he paced the room. None of the other 
guilders present had an answer, but their guest did.

&quot;Surrogate.&quot; Keiko announced from her &quot;spot&quot; in the room, present via 
holoprojection done by Eve (who was being to being her tall blonde self 
again) as they sat in on this private meeting between Guild members. 
&quot;He has the same ability to make &quot;drones&quot; to do his dirty work, of 
course twisted in a more necromancy style since he&#39;s a fallen angelic.&quot;

&quot;If it wasn&#39;t bad enough we have to face the twisted rejects of Heaven 
itself --&quot; Greymalkin fumes, &quot;-- now we find ourselves facing a threat 
from someone else&#39;s &quot;reality&quot;.&quot;

&quot;But to proclaim this an attack from CLAMP is premature.&quot; Eve notes, 
motioning with her hands as she spoke, &quot;All we know is that this is 
some sort of &quot;CLAMP School&quot;, but we don&#39;t know who sent it or why.&quot;

Keiko nods her head, taking up the slack from Eve and continuing, &quot;And 
without that information we&#39;re no closer to solving that than we are to 
figuring out the appearance of these Prime Drone units who seemingly 
--&quot; (Keiko&#39;s commlink beeps) &quot;Yamanaka.&quot;

&quot;Hi, Keiko -- guess what.&quot;

-----

Outside of Trooper HQ (at that moment)

Everyone was going their own ways, but Makomi lingered abit, walking up 
to Ami/Mako as they exited the building. &quot;This is wrong. Keiko isn&#39;t 
the enemy.&quot; she pleaded, &quot;How could she be an enemy? She&#39;s my friend! 
That can&#39;t be right! It can&#39;t be!&quot;

Ami nods her head, &quot;I&#39;ll see if I can find anything that&#39;ll convince 
the others of this. But in the meantime you&#39;ll have to ask Keiko to 
give us some answers to what happened yesterday. Please.&quot;

With a quick nod Makomi was already walking away.

&quot;Mama -- she understands.&quot; Makomi whispered, a smile coming back to her 
face. &quot;I knew she&#39;d help--&quot;

&quot;Help --&quot;

Suddenly the street was gone and she was panting heavily. Her muscles 
tense, sweat rolling down her nude body as she held a battered Ami 
down. The bed squeaked nosily while she --

&quot;GASP!!&quot; Makomi rasped, stumbling as the world came back into focus. 
She fell against a mailbox, panting. The feelings, the energy -- each 
sweat drop and every motion -- felt so damn real.

Right down to the smells and sensations -- it was as if she was back 
there again -- reliving that nightmare.

But it was only for a few seconds -- but why --?

As she stumbled back onto her feet, her senses returning, she failed to 
notice someone.

A shadow of a woman dressed in Winterian blue armor, body hidden in the 
muted shades of crystal blue, the only thing showing were her eyes 
which burned red.

If one could see beneath her mask, they could see that she was smiling.
