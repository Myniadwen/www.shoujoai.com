    <p><em>&quot;And then...I came here. I'm sorry, oniichan, I just couldn't think of where
    else to go, what to do...&quot; Touya 'shushed' her quietly and drew her into his
    familiar, protective embrace. </em></p>
    <p><em>&quot;It's all right Sakura. I'm glad you came to me. You can always come to
    me.&quot; He broke away and looked down at her, meeting her eyes. &quot;No matter
    what.&quot; </em></p>
    <p><em>She buried her face in his shoulder. &quot;Thank you, oniichan,&quot; she said
    softly, and Touya felt his insides twist at how small and broken her voice sounded. </em></p>
    <p><em>Yukito, sitting on the other side of her, laid a gentle hand on her shoulder,
    silently offering his comfort and support. Touya looked up and their eyes met over her
    head. The silent question in Touya's face was clear: 'What can I do for her?' and the
    answer was equally, painfully clear, 'Nothing...nothing more than what we are doing.' The
    dark-haired man's expression was a study in helpless frustration while Yukito's mirrored
    only pained resignation. </em></p>
    <p><em>The phone rang, shattering the silence and making all three of them jump. After the
    first ring, Yukito said quietly, &quot;I'll get it.&quot; </em></p>
    <p><em>Sakura was very still as Yukito picked up the phone. &quot;Hello?...Oh, hello,
    Tomoyo-chan.&quot; Sakura stiffened. &quot;No, no, that's all right...Oh? Yes...yes, she's
    here. Well...let me ask, hold on please...&quot; </em></p>
    <p><em>He held his hand over the mouthpiece of the phone and said quietly, &quot;She wants
    to know if it's all right to come over.&quot; </em></p>
    <p><em>Touya could feel Sakura's body shaking violently. &quot;No!&quot; she cried out.
    &quot;I can't! I...I *can't*!&quot; Touya hadn't seen her so panicked in years, not since
    she'd been a child and he'd told her about the ghosts he could see. </em></p>
    <p><em>&quot;Sakura!&quot; he said compellingly, &quot;You don't have to do anything that
    you don't want to!&quot; </em></p>
    <p><em>Yukito lifted the phone to his ear again. &quot;I don't think...&quot; he began
    softly. </em></p>
    <p><em>Touya waited until she was a little calmer and then, hating himself, he said,
    &quot;But don't you think you should see her and get this worked out?&quot; </em></p>
    <p><em>&quot;No!&quot; Sakura exploded. &quot;Don't you understand, oniichan? She said she
    *loved* me!&quot; </em></p>
    <p><em>&quot;Sakura, she was *asleep*! She didn't know what she was saying!&quot; Touya
    almost shouted, desperate to break through Sakura's near-hysteria. </em></p>
    <p><em>&quot;She was *crying*!&quot; </em></p>
    <p><em>&quot;Um...I don't think,&quot; Yukito began again, then paused.
    &quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot; </em></p>
    <p><em>But Tomoyo-chan had already hung up. </em></p>
    <p><em>Yukito gently replaced the receiver in it's cradle and turned to the two people on
    the couch. &quot;Sakura,&quot; he said, interrupting them. They turned towards him.
    &quot;I'm sorry, Sakura, but I think she heard you.&quot;</em> </p>

    <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
    <p>Slowly, carefully, Tomoyo replaced the receiver, even as she heard Yukito's voice
    saying, &quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot; on the other end of the line. After a moment, she
    mechanically picked up the receiver and dialed another number. </p>
    <p>&quot;Hello?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Li-kun?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Tomoyo-chan! She wasn't at her father's...&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I know. She's at her brother's house.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;She is? Is she all right? Why did she leave so abruptly?&quot; </p>
    <p>Tomoyo felt a hundred years old. &quot;Li-kun...it's a long story. She's ok...&quot; <em>Or
    she will be...I hope...</em> &quot;I'm sorry, I don't have time to explain it all right
    now,&quot; <em>Oh, forgive me, Li Syaoran...</em> </p>
    <p>&quot;Did something happen, Tomoyo-chan?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;No...Yes...But...&quot; she swallowed, willing herself to believe it. &quot;But
    everything will be all right.&quot; </p>
    <p>There was silence from the other end, and she could feel Li-kun's worry and curiosity
    reaching across the phone lines to her. But then he said, &quot;Very well. Call me when
    you can tell me what's going on, won't you, Tomoyo-chan?&quot; </p>
    <p>Tomoyo squeezed her eyes shut. &quot;I'll try, Li-kun.&quot; <em>Dear Li-kun. What a
    disservice I have done you. What a wrong I have done both of you.</em> </p>
    <p>She hung up the phone again, and finally allowed herself to think about the words that
    were still ringing through her head: </p>
    <p><em>&quot;She said she *loved* me!&quot;</em> </p>
      <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
    <p>Li Syaoran lay back and stared at the ceiling. He was worried...she'd tried to hide it
    but he'd never heard Tomoyo-chan sound so upset. He trusted her...she'd said that
    everything would be all right...but he was still worried. </p>
    <p>With a sigh, he got up and reached for his sword; the repetitive exercises always
    helped clear his mind. An ironic smile quirked his lips for a moment...he'd figured on
    being nervous the day before his wedding, but somehow, this wasn't quite what he'd
    expected. </p>
    <p>He worked at the katas for a long time, but when he'd finished, his mind was in as much
    turmoil as it had been before. With a frown he made his decision. He'd take a shower, get
    dressed...and then he would go and see Sakura. </p>
      <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
    <p>Tomoyo looked around her room and knew with a precise and cold clarity that she had
    ruined the very friendship she had sought to preserve. A pain shot through her - a
    physical pang, as if she had been hit by a piano wire cut loose from its moorings. </p>
    <p><em>So, this is what a heart breaking feels like</em>, she thought, and stood up to
    bathe and dress. </p>
    <p>There was nothing after that, no pain, no recrimination, no desire&#133; nothing at
    all. Like the world outside, she was filled with a cold, dull light. There was enough
    warmth to keep her alive, but not enough for her to live. </p>
    <p>Tomoyo pulled on a dress, and began to pack a small bag. A few changes of clothes,
    toiletries, she wouldn't need much. At last she sat down as if exhausted, and began to
    reflexively comb her long hair, watching herself blankly in the mirror. </p>
    <p>The motions were soothing, she let her mind wander &#150; into the distant past, her
    early childhood, when her mother would brush her hair, and talk about the cousin she had
    loved. Her mother used to always talk about Nadesico when she brushed Tomoyo's hair,
    telling her how like her Tomoyo was. Tomoyo had come to love this gracious beauty as an
    aunt long before she met Sakura and had come to love her too&#133;. </p>
    <p>No. She would not think about that. </p>
    <p>Nadesico. The beautiful, sweet girl of 16, who had left her family to marry a man 9
    years her elder. Sonomi had never forgiven her, or so Tomoyo had thought for many years. </p>
      <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
    <p>Tomoyo politely thanked the bodyguard who stood at the car for waiting. The woman
    smiled and bowed slightly but said nothing. Sliding onto the car seat, Tomoyo barely
    noticed the door closing, the bodyguard walking around the car, getting behind the wheel
    and starting the car&#146;s engine. Her mind was miles away or, more accurately, years
    away... </p>
    <p
    style="margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:



auto;margin-left:.5in">That
    day she had been reading in her mother's library and had pulled a book from the shelf. A
    thin notebook had slipped from its perch next to the book she held, and fell onto the
    floor. Tomoyo had picked it up meaning to replace it, when she saw that it was written in
    her mother's hand. A diary? </p>
    <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">She couldn't help herself, she began to read
    the entry: </p>
    <p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt; font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">He&#146;s
    gone. I'm not surprised. I'm not even sad. I'll miss him I suppose, but we really never
    suited each other. I was no replacement for the love of his life &#150; too angry, too
    strong &#150; and he - he could never come close to the one I loved.</span></em></p>

  <p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in">Tomoyo looked out the window at the sun
  dappling the garden. So, her father had left them. She had always supposed that to be the
  case, but her mother had never said. Tomoyo flipped the pages forward and read an entry at
  random: </p>
    <p
    style="margin-right:1.0in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.0in"><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt; font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;"><em>&#133;don't
    even know how to express my joy! I told Grandfather and thought he might begin to cry! I
    hope Taro gets the news, he should know that he&#146;ll be a father.</em></span></p>
    <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">And then, in the next entry: </p>
    <p
    style="margin-right:1.0in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;



mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.0in"><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;"><em>How do I
    say this? How do I even begin to express my fears and hopes, and happiness, and sadness?
    Taro is dead. I can't say I loved him, but he was a good man and now he'll never even see
    his child. My Gods, what a sadness it is to be an unlovable woman, cursed, as I am. At
    least I will love this child, as I cannot be loved.</em></span></p>
    <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Barely remembering to breathe now, Tomoyo
    flipped a few pages again and read. Guilt and curiosity warred within her, but curiosity
    was the stronger: </p>
    <p
    style="margin-right:1.0in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;



mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">What a
    beautiful child! My Gods, look at her! She is beauty itself. When she smiles all my
    sadness falls from me and I know, I know in my heart that the world is a magnificent
    place. Taro, Nadesico, Grandmother, Mother and Father, look at this beautiful child and
    rejoice with me!</span></em> </p>
    <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Tomoyo stared at the page below her,
    watching as a single teardrop hit the paper, clinging precariously to the page. Quickly,
    she took her handkerchief and wiped it away, then dabbed at her eyes. She was so full of
    emotion she wasn't sure how to feel. Her father &#150; Taro, had died. Her mother hadn't
    lied, but what a thing it must have been, to marry a man you didn't love, then have him
    leave you, alone and pregnant. A small bird flew by the window and Tomoyo stared at it for
    a moment, listening to it call to its mate in a cheerful refrain...</p>
    <p>Traffic was slow, the car moved forward steadily. <em>Forward into what future?</em>
    she wondered. The bodyguards knew her moods well; they did not attempt to engage her in
    conversation, seeing that she wanted to be silent. Tomoyo was thankful to them for that.
    And thankful too, that they would be around to care for her mother after she had left. </p>
    <p><em>And where are you going to go?</em> Her inner voice asked softly. <em>Away</em>,
    she answered it. <em>Away from here. Away from her.</em> </p>
    <p><br>
    <br>
    Tomoyo stared out the window, her mind once again slipping back into the past. </p>
    <p
    style="margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:



auto;margin-left:.5in">She
    began to close the book, to replace it, when on impulse she turned to the beginning and
    read once more. The first few pages were commonplace teenage entries, then this: </p>
    <p
    style="margin-right:1.0in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;



mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.0in"><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;"><em>I told her
    today. I told her I love her. Gods what a fool I am. She smiled at me, that sweet smile
    that makes my heart turn over in my chest and said that she loves me too. But I knew that
    she didn&#146;t mean it the way I did. How can I let her know?</em></span></p>
    <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Tomoyo's heart began to chill. How well she
    knew that feeling! She read the next few pages, filled with similar misgivings, then: </p>
    <p
    style="margin-right:1.0in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;



mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">It was an
    amazing day. No, it was a miraculous day. After school today Nadesico and I were walking
    home, as always, and it began to rain. We ran to take shelter in a small hut &#150; that
    old outbuilding from the shrine that isn't there anymore &#150; and we were laughing at
    how wet we were, you know how it is. But the rain didn&#146;t stop and Nadesico got so
    cold she began to shiver, so I held her, trying to warm her up. She&#146;s so pale and
    beautiful, how often I've thought of her as a spirit, only upon this earth for a short
    while, then gone like a spring day. So I warmed her up and she laid her head on my chest,
    as we waited for the rain to lessen. </span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">I could hear
    my heart beating, I was so happy. I laid my head against hers, breathed in her scent and
    thought that if I died right then I would die happy. I don't know how long we sat like
    that, but I prayed the rain would never stop. </span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">Then it
    happened &#150; the rain stopped, and the most beautiful rainbow was visible from where we
    sat. We stood up to see it better and Nadesico took my hand and jumped in place &#150;
    she&#146;s always loved rainbows so much. And she threw her arms around my neck and hugged
    me. I was so happy I didn&#146;t move, just put my arms around her waist and looked at
    her. She turned to me smiling and leaned forward to kiss me&#133;and I kissed her back.
    Then the kiss changed, it wasn't a &quot;cousinly&quot; kiss anymore. Her lips were sweet
    and warm and I felt like I was flying. When she pulled away she smiled at me and took my
    hands in hers. </span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">&quot;I was
    thinking about what you said the other day, Sonomi-chan, and I do, I love you too.&quot;
    Her voice was so different I couldn't believe my ears! She did mean it this time &#150;
    the same way I did. How blessed I am!</span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Tomoyo looked up once again, taking a deep
    shuddering breath. How much she wanted to be that blessed, to have Sakura say those words
    to her. She stared once again at the garden, where the light now was fading, the birdsong
    changed, more muted, readying for the evening. One last time she turned pages and read: </p>
    <p
    style="margin-right:1.0in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;



mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.0in"><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;"><em>I would
    kill myself today but there would be no point. I am no one and nothing and it would make
    no difference. It would not save the family&#146;s honor &#150; in fact, I need to live to
    do that. Grandfather told me that now that&#133;she&#133;is gone, I have to carry on the
    family business. I don't mind, it is better than dying. But, I feel so cold, so lifeless. </em></span></p>
    <p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">For my future
    self I guess I should write down what happened, so I can never forget, but, it hurts so
    much I can barely write. I want to die.</span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The page was hard to read, Tomoyo noticed, tears had blurred the words badly. </p>
    <p
    style="margin-right:1.0in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;



mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">She is gone
    &#150;she left me for, for that man. Oh, this will never do, I need to write it out. </span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">Nadesico met
    Kinomoto-sensei (how I hate even writing his name!) a few weeks ago, when she fell on him.
    I wrote about that. It seemed so silly at the time, inconsequential. But she&#146;s been
    avoiding me recently and one day I spotted her talking to him at the edge of the woods. </span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">Yesterday I
    made up my mind to speak with her. I miss her, for one thing &#150; we were supposed to
    spend time together this year. And I'll admit, I was jealous. I love her so much I don't
    want to share her with anyone. </span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;"><br>
    We were walking home from school, as always when she told me that she was going to marry
    him. </span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;"><br>
    I can&#146;t&#133;I&#133;</span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    More tears. </p>
    <p
    style="margin-right:1.0in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;



mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;margin-left:1.0in"><em><span
    style="font-size:10.0pt;



font-family:&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;">I can do this.
    I have to. I asked her about our love and she smiled at me and said she'd always love me,
    but I could see that she didn&#146;t mean it, again, the way I do. She loves him&#133; I
    can tell&#133; and I want to kill him! How I hate the man who is taking my beloved away
    from me! How I hate her, how could she do this to me? Why can't I die right now?</span></em></p>
    <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Tomoyo shut the book, put her face in her
    hands and sobbed quietly. Her poor mother, so passionate, so in love with her cousin. How
    bizarre that the same relationship should repeat itself, Sonomi&#146;s daughter in love
    with Nadesico&#146;s. The irony was cruel and Tomoyo wasn't sure she would ever understand
    why it had to be that way. </p>
    <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Standing quickly, she returned the diary to
    its place, and put the book back on the shelf to hide it once again. She walked to the
    window, and put her hands upon the sill. The last rays of the sun cast a red-gold glow
    over the treetops and she sighed heavily.</p>
    <p>In the car, her head leaning on the window, Tomoyo echoed that sigh from her past. She
    made a decision that day, a promise to herself that she would never tell Sakura, never
    make Sakura choose between her and another person. And she had never had cause to regret
    that decision, until&#133;. </p>
    <p>Why couldn't Sakura have loved her? </p>
    <p>Tomoyo started as the bodyguard called her name. </p>
    <p>&quot;Ojou-sama,&quot; the woman repeated, &quot;We&#146;re here.&quot; </p>
    <p>Tomoyo looked around and quailed at the site of Touya's house. But, smoothing her dress
    across her legs, she thanked the driver politely, and got out as the door was opened for
    her. </p>
    <p>Today she would apologize, and try to mend what she had so carelessly broken. </p>
    <p>Tomorrow she would see Sakura married to the man she loved, and tomorrow she would say
    goodbye. </p>
    <p>And the day after... </p>
    <p>The day after...she would leave. </p>
