<h1>Remastered (part 4 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Here we go again, Round 2---&quot; Nina sighs, holding her pulse rifle up
abit as she scans the skyline.

&quot;What&#39;s with the honkin&#39; big flyswatter? Fly give you a complex after
last time?&quot; Kero goaded.

&quot;Shut up or I&#39;ll test this flyswatter on you!&quot;

&quot;Behave, you two, behave!&quot; Sakura motions, keeping the two apart.
&quot;Variant on the old costume?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s feather in honor of Fly, but more streamline to give you better
maneuverability---&quot; (gives a wings neck piece to Kero, and pins to Nina &amp;
Eliza.)

Eliza - &quot;Very beautiful.&quot;

Kero - &quot;Yeah! Alright!&quot;

Eliza - &quot;Cute.&quot; (thoughts) &#39;Looks like I just came in on a flight with
complimentary pilot&#39;s wings. Man is this childish or what!&#39; (But to her
credit, Nina keeps her comments to herself).

&quot;You know what your doing, Sakura?&quot; Nina asks as she looks about again
for Fly, &quot;The rings didn&#39;t stop Fly before, and even the tractor beam on
a Frigate couldn&#39;t stop Fly from breaking free.&quot;

&quot;I know what I&#39;m doing. It might not work, but I know how to reach Fly.&quot;

Suddenly the air grows silent, then the wind begins to pick up and grow
stronger.

&quot;It&#39;s here-- again.&quot; Nina sighs, spinning to come face to face with Fly
as it comes into view. The first thing it does is aim it&#39;s winds down,
creating a powerful whirlwind effect scooping Sakura off the ground and
into the air.

&quot;FLY&#39;S TRYING TO KEEP SAKURA OFF GUARD SO SHE CAN&#39;T CAPTURE IT!!&quot;

&quot;GAIA!!&quot; Tomoyo yells out, ring held forth, &quot;REVEAL YOUR LUSH FOREST AND
BE SAKURA&#39;S ATTENDANT!!&quot;

From the ground a beautiful mini forest blooms, complete with a net of
vines to catch Sakura as she falls back to terra firma.

&quot;All right! Good catch!&quot; Kero cheers.

From her pocket, she draws a card. &quot;JUMP!&quot;

With the jump wings on her boots, she leaps into the air straight at
Fly,grabbing onto it&#39;s neck.

&quot;--no PLEASE-- don&#39;t hurt me-- no more-- please DON&#39;T--&quot; the voice calls
out from within.

&quot;It&#39;s alright. I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot; Sakura whispers, allowing gravity to
slowly pull her down Fly&#39;s neck until she stops, arms gripped around
Fly&#39;s neck, body resting on Fly&#39;s chest. &quot;It&#39;s alright. I&#39;m here-- come
out-- don&#39;t be afraid-- come out--&quot;

For seconds nothing, then slowly two hands pass through Fly&#39;s body,
slowly reaching out. As they reach, Sakura remains motionless waiting,
continuing to whisper softly to Fly. Finally, with a little hesitation,
the two hand reach around Sakura,arms and all. As they do she leans back
and falls, pulling out a female figure with her. As they land onto the
net of vines, the female begins to cry hugging Sakura tight.

&quot;You&#39;re alright now. It&#39;s OK-- it&#39;s alright now-- it&#39;s alright.&quot;

The girl lies trembling in the stretcher as Sakura watches her, holding
her hand.

Fly already has returned to card form, leaving the riddle of the girl
behind.

She was Elfin in species, but she seemed frightened of something.

&quot;Why are you afraid?&quot; Sakura asks.

&quot;It won&#39;t stop-- making me do things-- violating things-- I don&#39;t want to
hurt people-- but it won&#39;t stop making me feel so bad-- it won&#39;t stop--&quot;

&quot;Hold your wand out and capture it.&quot; Nina suggests.

&quot;Capture?&quot;

&quot;Try it.&quot;

With great reluctance, Sakura takes her staff and holds it out over her.

&quot;Clow card, return to your power confined, Clow card!&quot;

Energy begins to gather, and course through her body, as it forms into
the shape of a card and flies free of her, only to be snatched out of the
air by Nina. &quot;I&#39;ll take that.&quot;

&quot;But-- the Clow card--&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s one of those fan created ones, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.&quot; (quickly
shoves it into a small lockbox one of the officers were holding) &quot;Think
she&#39;s feeling better now.&quot;

Sure enough Sakura finds herself being mauled by a very grateful girl,
who can&#39;t seem to thank her enough. With that Nina takes the box and
walks it to the shuttle. Briefly she stops, motions for Eliza to
approach, and quickly takes the card out to show her.

&quot;The Pervert Card?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a demented fan idea. Saw it mentioned once on a &quot;Captioned
Pictures&quot; section at www.shoujoai.com. When I heard her talk about
feeling like violating people I knew it had to be that card.&quot;

&quot;But what do we do with it? We can&#39;t give it to Sakura.&quot;

&quot;I know. It&#39;s going away--&quot; (puts it back into box) &quot;--far away. You know
what to do, right?&quot;

The officer nods his head and takes the box, walking back to the shuttle.

&quot;Where is it going?&quot; Eliza asks.

&quot;Ever see Raiders of the Lost Ark?&quot;

Storage Area IV (somewhere in the central rim)

The card is locked away in a huge vault.

Filled with a hundred thousand other boxes, both large and small.

Each filled with a hundred x a hundred thousand bad things.

The box, marked &quot;Bad Clow Cards&quot; is kept near the door though---

---since the Pervert Card won&#39;t be the last of the bad cards to be
caught.

Not by a long shot.

&quot;SNOOZER!! UP ALREADY!!&quot; Nina screams, her patience wearing thin. &quot;All
the magic in the Universe won&#39;t make her a better person if she can&#39;t
even wake up at a decent hour.&quot; (huffs breath) &quot;You&#39;re a disgrace to
Fictionals, you know that?!?&quot;

Sakura (upstairs) screams something as she barrels out the door on her
way down.

&quot;She&#39;s a walking disaster waiting to happen-- sigh.&quot;

&quot;I HEARD THAT!!&quot;

&quot;So what--&quot; (blinks as she goes back to waiting) &quot;--somethings NEVER
change-- sigh.&quot;

&quot;Two cards, one problem.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Nina Kotobuki (Lt.)

After the Clow Card incident (Fly) I decided I needed to keep an eye on
as much of the city as I could looking for other rogue cards. The
surveillance gear the Judgments used was good enough, but there were
still some blind spots. King Penguin Park was one of them, so I decided
to string it with campods.

I was just making my way back to the Daidouji residence (job completed)
when something caught my eye. It was in a lake in the park. When I neared
something strange came out, a ghostly figure that--

&quot;AAAHHHH!!!!&quot;

Northwest High (the next day)

&quot;STOP IT!! STOP IT!!&quot; Nina yells over the scream, &quot;Your making dogs deaf
for miles!!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry!!&quot;

That was the story Nina was telling them (minus the parts that implicate
her true reason for being there, or anything about the Clow Cards).

The gang was all there, the same girls Sakura knew when she was younger.

Nothing has changed, except the grade--- and a few other things.

------------------------------------------------------------

I&#39;m Sakura Kinomoto.

I&#39;m studying to advance to the next grade.

Right now I&#39;m at summer cheerleading practice.
We&#39;re getting ready for the National Cheerleading Competition coming
soon.

But while we do, it&#39;s summer so Naoko is telling everyone scary stories.

Nina jumped in with her own story, mostly because she figured out that
telling ghost stories pushed my buttons, so she does it to annoy me.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Lake?! The lake at New King Penguin Park? That lake!? Sounds familiar--&quot;

Nina - &quot;Know any other lake with a large penguin slide nearby?&quot;

&quot;N-n-no-- I mean the s-story--&quot;

New King Penguin Park. Named that because a frustrated Nekochanian with a
matter teleport device shifted the park with her secret (hidden in plain
sight) business complex to give it a better location. Thus the park,
which used to be between Sakura&#39;s old home and school, was now located
between Tomoyo&#39;s home &amp; school. The things crazy Nekos would do for a
higher profit margain.

&quot;Uh-- N-Naoko? You think something else was the monster? Tree, telephone
pole, another crazy Neko, something? I&#39;m sure we did this before--&quot;

Naoko shakes her head in the negative.

&quot;Didn&#39;t think so.&quot;

As practice resumes, Nina walks off smiling wickedly. She got what she
wanted after all, and got right back on Sakura&#39;s nerves again, and was
grinning like a Cheshire cat because of it.

&quot;Anything wrong, Sakura?&quot;

&quot;Nothing--&quot; (sobs) &quot;--nothing at all.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

NINA&#39;S MEAN!!

(sobs and cries) Why do people insist on telling scary stories in a Realm
of Dreams?!?

During the summer no less? I have to pass that park on my way back
home--- (sobs)

But the story does seem familiar---

------------------------------------------------------------

As Nina sighs she looks up into the sky. &quot;If she wasn&#39;t so easy to
fluster I&#39;d be ashamed of my--&quot;

A pom pom flies overhead. &quot;--the pom poms are migrating for the winter?&quot;

The pom pom lands in a tree in front of Nina.

&quot;Must be the pom pom&#39;s mating season--- or something.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;ll get it!!&quot; Sakura offers, dashing off in the direction it
went.

&quot;She&#39;s got energy again today!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s definitely getting stronger each and every day!&quot;

But for a stronger girl, Sakura can&#39;t help but start crying when she
thinks about the &#39;ghost&#39;.

------------------------------------------------------------

Nina&#39;s leg nearly slips out from her, bringing her slamming into the tree
bark as she looks down.

&quot;--oh now this&#39;ll look nifty on my resume. A day in Summer, somebody
found a Kotobuki stuck in a tree while she was retrieving a runaway pom
pom with acute dysfunctional disorder, so they brought in a one armed man
to wave her down---&quot; (moans as she looks at the height) &quot;--I should shut
up and stop jinxing myself--- lord knows a one armed man might show up
any minute and start waving.&quot;

As Nina looks back up and focuses on the pom pom, a &quot;Ah!&quot; catches her
ears.

She quickly grabs the tree and starts sweating, &quot;Don&#39;t wave! Don&#39;t wave!
Don&#39;t wave!&quot;

&quot;What are you doing up there?&quot;

Nina stops, blushes, and looks down. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you.&quot; (Sakura) &quot;What do
you want, Snoozer.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;M NOT SNOOZER!!&quot; (huffs breath) &quot;I came to get that pom pom!&quot;

&quot;Get in line! I was up here first!!&quot;

&quot;---&quot; (starts rifling through top)

Nina - &quot;?&quot; (blinks) &quot;Not interested in seeing you topless (though you
have developed rather nicely in that department!) Thanks anyway! You can
go away now---&quot;

&quot;There it is--&quot; (holds out key) &quot;Key of the star, with powers burning
bright, reveal the staff and shine your light! Release!&quot;

As the staff grows Sakura reaches into a pocket. &quot;Brought it. Heh heh
heh---&quot;

&quot;Brought what?! You better not be thinking what I think your---&quot;

&quot;JUMP!!&quot; (and with that Sakura takes a large leap into the air)

&quot;No! No! No! No!&quot; (grabs tree) &quot;Sakura you--&quot; (tree vibrates abit as
Sakura lands, but nothing too serious) &quot;---oh---&quot;

&quot;You were saying?&quot;

Nina joins Sakura at her level, scowling as she does. &quot;I hope somebody
waves YOU down--- it&#39;d be worth it just to watch you fall on your---&quot;
(suddenly Nina stops) &quot;--singing?&quot;

&quot;That song.&quot;

As the two of them looked, Sakura sighed. &quot;It&#39;s Tomo-chan.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Tomoyo is leading the school choir this year.

She sings like an angel. Just listening to her makes me feel all floaty--
sigh---

She&#39;s won a whole lot of singing contests, and all her awards and
trophies are located in our bedroom next a case Sonomi put up for all the
awards &amp; trophies I won. The two cases sorta make a match set, one next
to each other, sorta like Tomoyo &amp; myself. Side by side.

------------------------------------------------------------

As Tomoyo bows, and the teacher leaves, Nina climbs through the window
and sits on the piano bench much to Tomoyo&#39;s surprise. &quot;? How&#39;d you get
up here ?&quot;

&quot;I climbed up here.&quot; (whispers) &quot;Brought your favorite Ham-ham with me.&quot;

&quot;Tomo-chan.&quot; (Sakura from the window) &quot;Hey, Sakura! H-how&#39;d you--&quot; (looks
down at Sakura&#39;s feet) &quot;Oh, Jump. Right.&quot;

&quot;Choir practice again?&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh. Nationals are up in September. This year we&#39;re leading off with
Greensleeves. So when&#39;s your practice over? 3?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Guess you&#39;ll be home before me---&quot; (goes into shock)

&quot;Sakura-chan--- what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;WALK HOME WITH ME!!!&quot; (grabs Tomoyo, crying)

&quot;There, there now-- it&#39;s alright. It&#39;s OK--&quot;

Nina (disgusted) - &quot;Savior of the Realm of Dreams-- fhht.&quot; (walks out the
door) &quot;Not going to let myself be saved by that crybaby! Seeya Ham-girl.&quot;

&quot;--I&#39;m NOT a crybaby!! I&#39;M NOT!!&quot; Sakura sobs, holding Tomoyo tighter.

&quot;Don&#39;t listen to her. Don&#39;t listen--&quot; (kisses Sakura&#39;s forehead) &quot;--oh
Sakura-chan--&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

After 3PM (on the way home).

&quot;Illusion?&quot;

&quot;Remember? It did that the first time this happened year ago. It has to
be illusion.&quot; Tomoyo noted.

The two were roller-blading alone, Sakura convincing Nina to take the
girls out for ice cream while they went into New Penguin Park alone.
Suddenly Sakura stops. &quot;There it is.&quot; With shaky hands she draws forth
the key and holds it out. &quot;Key of the star, with powers burning bright,
reveal the staff and shine your light.. RELEASE!&quot;

As the last word leaves her lips the staff charges up, growing in her
hand to full length. Quickly she moves forward and thrust the water ring
out towards the lake. &quot;Umi! Reveal Illusion&#39;s presence by pushing aside
it&#39;s watery shield!&quot;

Slowly the water begins to back up from the center, the quicker, until a
huge hole is open in the lake revealing it&#39;s hidden occupant.

&quot;Clow card, return to your power confined! Illusion!!&quot;

With one snap of her staff, tendrils of energy shoot out and catch
Illusion. Within seconds the card is wrapped up, changed back, and in
Sakura&#39;s hand. As the water goes back into the lake Sakura holds the card
triumphantly. &quot;I did it! And this time it only took one minute!
Tomo-chan, I--&quot; (faints)

&quot;I know. I taped the whole thing! Mirra-chan&#39;s going to be so happy when
she sees this episode!&quot;

&quot;---but it&#39;s too short to be a real episode-- it only took five minutes
to capture--&quot; Sakura laments.

&quot;We&#39;ll call it a Cardcaptor intermission.&quot;

&quot;--if you say so--&quot;

Suddenly the water begins to shine and glow.

&quot;Wh-what? But--&quot; (looks at hand) &quot;I have Illusion right-- here--&quot;

A ghostly female figure in a kimono rises out of the water. She looks
like she was drowned in life, and reaches out to Sakura. &quot;To-to-Tomoyo?!?
Do you---&quot;

&quot;I see it--- I see it--- a woman in a kimono---&quot; she whispers, filming it
rising up, staring Sakura straight in the eyes. With a panicked yelp
Sakura grabs Tomoyo and drags her away.

She doesn&#39;t stop running until they come to the front door of the
Daidouji Estates, and give Tomoyo&#39;s bodyguards the shock of their lives
when Sakura comes barreling through the halls with Tomoyo in tow. &quot;I--I
thought we were picking up the two later?&quot;

&quot;They can&#39;t wait to feel the Earth move beneath them?&quot; the other one
remarks, blinking beneath her sunglasses as she looks down the corridor
Sakura ran down in a panic. &quot;Sakura seems in a hurry.&quot;

&quot;When you gotta go, you gotta go--- I guess.&quot;

&quot;THAT&#39;S NOT FAIR!!&quot; Sakura moaned as she washes her hair. &quot;NOT FAIR AT
ALL!&quot;

&quot;But you caught Illusion, right?&quot; Tomoyo (lying in the bathtub waiting
for Sakura) thinks out loud, &quot;So what was that that came out of the lake
after Illusion? Can&#39;t be the card&#39;s doing.&quot;

&quot;Something strange came out! And I don&#39;t like things that are strange!
They&#39;re freaky!!&quot;

&quot;Sakura-chan--&quot; Tomoyo sighs, &quot;--can ghosts live in a Realm of Dreams?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. In the waking world ghosts used to hang around the tree in
the park, and Illusion once hung out in the lake, but I never saw that
thing before-- it&#39;s something different--&quot; (blinks) &quot;--maybe it&#39;s one of
those fan Clow cards Nina mentioned. That could be it! It&#39;s a fan Clow
card!&quot;

Sakura finishes washing and joins Tomoyo in the bath, both women lounging
side by side soaking in the huge tub. &quot;Sakura-chan, you&#39;d like it to be a
Clow card wouldn&#39;t you? Your not comfortable with even the thought of
ghosts (which makes it convenient that you didn&#39;t fall in love with Naoko
since she loves ghost stories).&quot;

&quot;Clow cards are not as scary as ghosts, and at least Clow cards I can
deal with. Ghosts I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Kero didn&#39;t have an answer either--&quot; Tomoyo admits as she leans towards
Sakura, wrapping an arm around her and resting her head on Sakura&#39;s
shoulder. &quot;--I feel so safe just being with you.&quot;

&quot;Me too.&quot; (hugs Tomoyo back) &quot;I&#39;m so lucky to have you with me---&quot; (sighs
as she hears Kero&#39;s voice at the door) &quot;SAKURA!! DINNER&#39;S SOON!! DON&#39;T
FORGET TO SEND SOMEONE UP WITH MY DISH THIS TIME!! I&#39;M STARVING RIGHT
NOW!!&quot;

&quot;Alright, Kero, alright--&quot; (sighs) &quot;--I wish Nina was actually a better
bodyguard than she was a pain in the butt. At least we should tell a few
of your bodyguards about the Clow cards.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s best if we keep the secret to ourselves. We haven&#39;t told anyone yet
and even here it&#39;s best if we keep the secret. Though sometimes I suspect
mother may be catching on.&quot;

&quot;I noticed.&quot; Sakura smiles, &quot;That was the same way with Toya. He
eventually figured it out.&quot;

&quot;Hope that doesn&#39;t happen with mother.&quot;

With that the two kiss, eyes closed, bodies close. Their world only
existing of each other.

&quot;COME ON!! MAKE OUT LATER!! I&#39;M STARVING!!&quot; (Kero)

------------------------------------------------------------

Sakura sends Gaia to bring Kero his food.

&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Sakura asks, poking her food.

&quot;It&#39;s chicken fettucini. Eat it, it&#39;s good for you. Keep you awake more
often.&quot; Nina grumbles, serving Tomoyo as the others eat. &quot;Everyone else
is eating so pipe up, or I&#39;m going to give YOU hell when it&#39;s your turn
to cook again.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m eating, I&#39;m eating--&quot; (surprised expression) &quot;--it&#39;s actually
edible.&quot;

&quot;---if Eliza didn&#39;t ask me to behave I&#39;d so hit you right now--&quot; (Nina
down and calms herself as she begins eating) &quot;?&quot; (looks at picture)
&quot;Who&#39;s that? Noticed all these pictures but--&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Nadeshiko, Sakura&#39;s mother, at 16---&quot; Sonomi whispers, looking
over at the picture with a loving gaze. &quot;She was a model when she started
Junior High. That&#39;s why so many pictures of her exist to this day, even
here--&quot; (sighs) &quot;Since Sakura moved in I put up new pictures of her every
day so we can both remember her, and how much we-- I mean Sakura-- I--&quot;
(blushes, skips subject and doesn&#39;t mention it) &quot;Say, where&#39;s your
&#39;shadow&#39;? The tall blonde?&quot;

&quot;Eliza is NOT my &#39;shadow&#39;! And she&#39;s supervising something tonight so I&#39;m
keeping her food over in the fridge. I&#39;ll cook it the minute she comes
home so it&#39;s fresh when she eats it. No cold leftovers for her if I have
anything to say about it.&quot;

&quot;Lots of prep for someone who&#39;s NOT your shadow.&quot; Sonomi pries.

&quot;Back off. What&#39;s between me and Eliza is BETWEEN me &amp; Eliza. So bug
off.&quot;

&quot;And what makes you--&quot;

&quot;Your thoughts are clear, so to speak. I don&#39;t need to be a Jedi master
to see what your up to--&quot;

&quot;Your paranoid.&quot;

&quot;Oh sure! You just don&#39;t want to admit--&quot;

Sakura gives up on trying to understand what the two are implying and
goes back to eating.

------------------------------------------------------------

Back in Sakura&#39;s &quot;lab&quot;

&quot;Dessert! I took Nina&#39;s when she wasn&#39;t looking!&quot;

&quot;YAH!!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Downstairs

Umi - &quot;Dessert?&quot;

Nina - &quot;Made an extra one. Figured Snoozer would try to steal my--?
Where&#39;s my back-up dessert?&quot; (looks over at Umi) &quot;Well?&quot;

Umi - &quot;Uh-- that was yours?&quot;

Nina - &quot;---good thing I made one for Kero, I&#39;ll &quot;steal&quot; that one---&quot;
(looks over her shoulder as someone enters the room) &quot;Tomoyo?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Back in Sakura&#39;s &quot;lab&quot; (ten minutes later)

&quot;Hi Kero!&quot; (Tomoyo walks in) &quot;There&#39;s an e-mail for Nina, but I made a
copy for you to read.&quot; (looks at the two) &quot;Sharing seconds?&quot;

&quot;I figured we had all that pound cake and I didn&#39;t want it to go to
waste.&quot; (looks at fax in Tomoyo&#39;s hand as she hands it to her) &quot;Isn&#39;t
that illegal?&quot;

&quot;Only if she finds out. She just left to deliver dinner to Eliza--- think
I&#39;ll have a piece myself---&quot;

&quot;---&quot; (as Tomoyo makes herself a slice of the ice cream/pound cake treat,
Sakura reads the e-mail)

To Lt. Kotobuki, Nina

From Lt. Destiny, Eliza

Re - New Penguin Park Menace

The mainframe&#39;s online and the sensors are all engaged.

In the last few minutes it&#39;s been picking up strange readings from the
lake in New King Penguin Park. It&#39;s Clow energy but there&#39;s also a
secondary signature, type unknown.

It might be spirit energy but spirits in the Realm of Dreams is unusual
and very rare to say the least, so nobody bothered to keep a record of
the types of spirits that show up here from time to time.

There&#39;s also a complication that just came to light.

Misho NamoCatCat (NamoCatCat Corps) announced her &quot;Taste of Tokyo&quot; food
fair to happen in New King Penguin Park in a few days. I know, I know,
total theft of the &quot;Taste of Honolulu&quot; event but she insists it&#39;s her own
idea. With that spirit in the lake, and the attendance to this food event
expected to be high, a strong presence by us &amp; Sakura/Tomoyo would be
recommended.

And since it&#39;s a big event, Mirra-chan should come since there can be
lots of fun to be had while we seal up the ghost and call it a night. She
can bring her friend and enjoy the food and each other.

There won&#39;t be any chance of doing the sealing prior to the event
however. Misho has the park swarming with her people and it&#39;s filled 24/7
with shift upon shift of workers preparing for the event.

So it&#39;s event night or bust on the capture.

I&#39;m going to be late so please don&#39;t wait up. I&#39;ll warm up dinner when I
get home.

You know how much I love your cooking--- as much as I love you.

Take care, sweetness.

Eliza Destiny.

PS - Don&#39;t forget you promised to behave yourself if I treat you extra
special when I get home.

Sakura makes a nauseated expression as she reads. &quot;Eeewww--- they really
ARE that close!&quot;

&quot;Figured the way she could keep Nina on a tight leash that they were
lovers.&quot;

&quot;I know but--- eeww!! I can&#39;t even think of the things they do!&quot;

&quot;Sakura-chan!&quot; (smiles as she sits down to eat the treat) &quot;You shouldn&#39;t
judge them. They don&#39;t do anything worst than we do in bed--- and I know
how excited you can get when we make love.&quot;

&quot;Tomo-chan!!&quot; (looks at Kero nervously) &quot;You know I-- Well--&quot;

&quot;Sorry. I forget sometimes you&#39;re a little shy about talking about our
more-- intimate moments.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me--&quot; (Kero) &quot;--that&#39;s all fascinating about your love lifes and
all but let&#39;s talk about the card for a second?&quot; (serious) &quot;Like Eliza
said there&#39;ll be lots of people there. If it&#39;s a troublesome Clow card we
should nip it in the bud before anything happens! Take the cards, and the
rings, and go down and shut down it&#39;s ghost act once and for all and
teach it who the true mistress of the cards are!&quot;

&quot;Yeah--&quot; Sakura blushes, &quot;--you&#39;re right. As usual. I have a job to do.&quot;

&quot;Then afterwards you can bring me home the good stuff!&quot;

(both Tomoyo &amp; Sakura blinks)

&quot;Don&#39;t waste time on those little restaurant selections! Bring me home a
doggie bag from an Iron Chef restaurant! Maybe Iron Chef Kobe (Italian)!
Or French (Sakai)! Something good, and really really neat! Or maybe fancy
and elegant! At least from a 3 star restaurant if not an Iron Chef and--&quot;

&quot;Is that REALLY why you want me to go?!&quot;

&quot;Of course not. Capture the card. Now back to my treats. Meats if you
can, but I&#39;ll settle for sushi from a good place or maybe--&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Sakura woke up to sobbing.

Next to her Tomoyo was crying in her sleep, her arms out as if trying to
grab something.

&quot;---sakura-- no-- sakura-chan--- don&#39;t leave me--- no--- sakura--&quot;

Carefully she wraps her arms around Tomoyo, drawing her close, and gently
starts to rock her to sleep, whispering quietly &quot;I&#39;m here-- I&#39;m here
Tomo-chan-- always-- I&#39;m here-- don&#39;t cry-- I&#39;m here--&quot;

Tomoyo&#39;s arms wrap around Sakura, and her head buries itself into her
shoulder as she holds on as if for dear life, crying softly, begging
Sakura to stay with her. After awhile her sobs quiet down, and she falls
back asleep. Sakura rolls back onto her back, pulling Tomoyo on top of
her, and holds her throughout the night in her arms, cradling her beloved
as she slumbers peacefully.

Sometimes Tomo-chan cries in her sleep

I don&#39;t know why, but I think she still has nightmares about me leaving
her behind.

Once I asked and she told me a boy took me away. A boy in strange robes
armed with a sword.

I guess she means Li Syaoran, but he&#39;s been gone ever since I knew in my
heart Tomoyo was the right one for me. He eventually got together with
Meilin I think--- don&#39;t know how, but maybe they&#39;re happy where they are.
Sleeping under the same dream sky as I am, in each others arms as happy
as I am.

I keep telling Tomoyo that I&#39;ll never leave her, but sometimes her
nightmares return, making her cry and hurting her. I don&#39;t like seeing
Tomo-chan cry, it huts me seeing her in pain.

Sometimes people say when a nightmare is firmly lodged in someone&#39;s mind
and never leaves no matter how much a person knows it&#39;ll never happen,
it&#39;s probably a &quot;darkling&quot; (a minion of the Realm of Nightmares) that&#39;s
causing the nightmares.

If I ever found out something was hurting Tomo-chan, I would never
forgive it, and punish it severely for hurting my precious Tomoyo. If
anything is hurting her, they&#39;re going to regret the day they heard the
name Sakura Kinomoto!

------------------------------------------------------------

As Sakura wakes up, she&#39;s briefly blinded by the light of the morning
coming through a window. But as her senses focus, she feels Tomoyo&#39;s
slumbering body still on her&#39;s. As she looks, Tomoyo turns her head, and
looks her straight in the eyes and smiles. &quot;Thank you, Sakura-chan.&quot; With
that she kisses Sakura softly, a tear rolling down her cheek as she does,
then she rests her head on Sakura&#39;s strong shoulder and whispers softly
&quot;Thank you.&quot; one more time before closing her eyes.

For a long the time two lie there, exchanging touches and kisses,
eventually making love--

--but that&#39;s an Intermission story for the Lemon section.

We fast forward to a few days and the Taste of Tokyo event, already in
progress---
