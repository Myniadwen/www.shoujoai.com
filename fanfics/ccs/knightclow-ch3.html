<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 3 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>        Tomoyo smiled as the black haired young woman strode into the 
newspaper offices of the Times while Yukito followed right behind her. 
All around them reporters typed away on computers, people rushed about, 
and talk buzzed loudly.

        Almost as soon as they were making their way to Tomoyo&#39;s desk 
Kaho Mitsuki stuck her head out of her office to demand, &quot;Did you get 
it?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Tomoyo smiled.

        &quot;Get in here,&quot; Kaho disappeared inside.

        &quot;Into the lion&#39;s den,&quot; Yukito said with a smile as they headed 
to the office.

        &quot;First hand story on the Knight,&quot; Tomoyo put the disk on the 
editor&#39;s desk, &quot;and we even have photos of her in action.&quot;

        &quot;Why Knight?&quot; Kaho asked as she popped the disk in her 
computer&#39;s drive, scanning it as Yukito put a set of photo&#39;s of the 
cloaked figure down.

        &quot;We&#39;ve got to call her something,&quot; Tomoyo improvised quickly, 
&quot;and it&#39;s pretty catchy. Might make for good headlines.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Kaho finished reading, the brown haired older 
woman turning to look the photos over. &quot;None of her face, too bad. 
Still,&quot; she held up a sharp photo of the Knight calling on her magic, 
&quot;that&#39;s pretty impressive.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Yukito blushed a bit, the light brown haired man 
looking down shyly.

        &quot;No ones gotten this close to the Knight&#39;s activities before,&quot; 
Kaho sat back with a thoughtful look, &quot;I&#39;m very impressed. We&#39;re going 
to run with this story...&quot;

        &quot;Thank you ma&#39;am,&quot; Tomoyo smiled.

        Kaho nodded, &quot;... and I want you two to stay on this story, too. 
If you can find out who she is, why she does this, I&#39;d appreciate it.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll do our best,&quot; Tomoyo waved as she and Yukito headed out.

        They separated, Tomoyo heading to her desk while Yukito headed 
off to get more film and to go over his camera. Tomoyo sat down at her 
desk, finishing up another story while considering the situation that 
she and Yukito were now in..

        &#39;I wonder what Kaho would have said if we produced the photos 
that Yukito got that showed Sakura&#39;s face,&#39; Tomoyo smiled. She typed 
away, &#39;This agreement we&#39;ve struck with her could pay off big, but it 
could also blow up in our faces.&#39;

        Tomoyo picked up her telephone, connecting with the archives. 
&quot;Hey Rika,&quot; Tomoyo instantly recognized the woman&#39;s voice, &quot;I need you 
to do a search for me?&quot;

        &quot;How can I help?&quot; Rika asked in her pleasant way.

        &quot;I&#39;m working on a story on that mysterious guardian of the 
city,&quot; Tomoyo smiled wryly at how dramatic that sounded, &quot;I was 
wondering if you could do a search on similar events?&quot;

        &quot;What time range?&quot; Rika said seriously, the researcher focused 
on her work.

        &quot;A very good question,&quot; Tomoyo admitted. She thought about it a 
moment, &quot;Start with the last thirty years, then extend it back by the 
same amount.&quot; A bit apologetically she added, &quot;I&#39;m not sure how far back 
this all might go.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll get started immediately,&quot; Rika agreed.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Tomoyo smiled as she disconnected.

        &#39;From what Sakura told us this sort of thing has been going on 
for years,&#39; Tomoyo thought as she went back to her work, &#39;so it should 
crop up in our archives at times. That material will make a good backup 
piece on the Knight.&#39;

        The day rushed by, Tomoyo and Yukito often being sent out 
together to cover various small stories. It was kind of funny that there 
was all this speculation around the office that they were more than 
friends, especially when you considered the fact that poor Yukito was 
gay.

        &quot;So have you told Toya about all this?&quot; Tomoyo asked as they 
drove back from a story.

        &quot;Right after I got back home last night,&quot; Yukito agreed. Dressed 
in T- shirt and dress pants he looked crisply neat, as always.

        &#39;Well, I do too,&#39; Tomoyo admitted to herself. Despite the wear 
and tear of being a reporter she tried her best to look good, either in 
her long pants or dresses. It all depended on the situation, what sort 
of story she might be covering.

        &quot;So how did that go?&quot; Tomoyo asked curiously.

        &quot;He pretty much confirmed everything Sakura told us,&quot; Yukito 
admitted. He sighed softly, &quot;But not much more, he seems to be pretty 
much out of the loop now.&quot;

        &quot;Isn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Tomoyo noted. She looked thoughtful, 
&quot;Family spat?&quot;

        Yukito looked oddly uncomfortable, &quot;I&#39;m not sure. The feeling I 
got was that he really didn&#39;t want to know about that part of Sakura&#39;s 
life.&quot;

        &quot;Can&#39;t be fun, knowing your sister is going out to fight 
monsters,&quot; Tomoyo agreed. They pulled in front of the paper, both 
dropping off their stuff quickly. Tomoyo looked at Yukito thoughtfully, 
&quot;Do you want a ride home?&quot;

        &quot;Toya&#39;s picking me up,&quot; Yukito smiled.

        Tomoyo nodded thoughtfully. &quot;Then I&#39;ll see you later, partner,&quot; 
she waved.

        &quot;Stay out of trouble,&quot; Yukito called out as she left.

        The little car mad it&#39;s way across town, pulling to a stop in 
front of the museum It was quite a modern building, but the 
architectural design was all modeled after that of the ancient Greeks 
and Romans. Great white pillars rose up around the entrance, supporting 
the museum roof, and as Tomoyo entered the building the floors gleamed 
like polished glass.

        &quot;Ms. Daidouji,&quot; one of the museum employees recognized her as 
she walked in, &quot;is there anything I can do to help?&quot; He smiled, &quot;We saw 
your story in the papers this morning, it was great.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m off work,&quot; Tomoyo hastened to say, &quot;just looking around.&quot;

        &quot;Do you want me to let Dr. Kinomoto know you&#39;re here?&quot; he 
offered.

        Tomoyo hesitated, &quot;If it isn&#39;t any trouble, sure.&quot;

        &quot;No problem,&quot; and the young man was gone.

        Tomoyo made her way inside, looking around at the various 
sections of the grand museum. Still, her steps carried her to the China 
exhibit, and the artifacts that had been recovered recently. A set of 
robes hung in a display case, blue tripped in gold, while nearby an odd 
staff rested, a design incorporating a sun and moon on the top.

        &quot;The metalwork on that staff is remarkable,&quot; the soft voice came 
from behind her, &quot;centuries ahead of it&#39;s time.&quot;

        Tomoyo turned to see Sakura standing there, a soft smile on the 
assistant curator&#39;s face. Her short, slightly ruffled brown hair fell 
into her eyes, dressed in a simple lab coat over street clothes. She 
also was a bit dusty, a smudge on the tip of her nose.

        &quot;You&#39;re a mess,&quot; Tomoyo stepped forward, wiping the smudge off 
and bringing a faint blush to the other women&#39;s cheeks.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Sakura looked down shyly, &quot;I was helping out over in 
our restoration&#39;s department. I&#39;m not so good with the fine work, but 
I&#39;m a wizz at cleaning.&quot;

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Tomoyo nodded. She tilted her head to the side, looking 
the other woman over thoughtfully before asking, &quot;Do you have any plans 
for tonight?&quot;

        &quot;I wasn&#39;t planning to go out,&quot; Sakura said softly, reaching to 
touch the necklace she wore, the enchanted charm hanging from it.

        &quot;That&#39;s not quite what I meant,&quot; Tomoyo said. She shrugged, &quot;I 
was going to go out and grab some dinner, I was wondering if you&#39;d care 
to join me?&quot;

        &quot;Hoeee?&quot; Sakura blinked.

        &quot;Nothing improper,&quot; Tomoyo hastened to say, &quot;I was just hoping 
we could talk a bit.&quot;

        Sakura seemed to shake off her moment of surprise and said, 
&quot;I... I think I&#39;d like that.&quot;</pre>
