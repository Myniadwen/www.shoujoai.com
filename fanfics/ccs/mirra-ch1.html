<h1>Mirra's Trilogy (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>(Note - The events of this story take place between CCSakura 
Remastered II Episodes 6 &amp; 7).

It was just about 2 and a half weeks to Christmas, and the girls were 
taking the weekend to unwind at Hikaru&#146;s auntie Fuu&#146;s winter home up 
at a ski resort village in the mountains. Tonight, however, on the eve 
of their trip, Mirra wasn&#146;t sleeping well. She shivered in her spot on 
the bed, curled up abit feeling miserable. &#145;I&#146;m such a coward---&#146; she 
thought to herself.

She had enjoyed the time spent with Hikaru, and felt that nothing 
could tear them apart. But she was getting better, and she felt her 
time with her beloved was coming to it&#146;s end. She wanted to beg her to 
stay, to be by her side forever--- but she couldn&#146;t. She was too 
afraid to. She didn&#146;t know how to say it, or what to say to begin with 
and it was killing her on the inside.

Pretty soon she would go home, and they&#146;d be apart again. They&#146;d still 
be together whenever possible, but she was getting anxious. But 
they&#146;ve grown so close recently, so very close, that she wanted it to 
go on forever--- &#145;Selfish!&#146; Mirra hissed at herself, berating her own 
feelings, &#145;It&#146;s not fair to her! She has to go home--- be away from 
me--- even for awhile--- so nobody hurts her--- Mimic---&#146;

Briefly her thoughts go back on Mimic, and what she almost did to 
Hikaru, and involuntarily she sobbed, quickly covering her mouth to 
silence herself. She froze, breath nearly still, wondering---

&#147;I know your awake, Mirra-chan---&#148; she heard the comforting voice call 
out from behind. Slowly, almost awkwardly, Mirra turned around to face 
Hikaru, sad faced. &#147;I&#146;m sorry---&#148; she whispered.

&#147;My precious&#146; sorry?&#148; (Hikaru cuddles closer, smiling her infectiously 
happy smile which always made Mirra smile in turn) &#147;Tell me what&#146;s 
wrong.&#148;

Mirra couldn&#146;t say it. She didn&#146;t want to. She just laid there, 
looking at Hikaru uncertain what to say. Suddenly she kissed Mirra and 
smiled. &#147;I know what&#146;s on your mind.&#148;

&#147;N-n-no.&#148;

&#147;I know---&#148; (hugs Mirra) &#147;---you need a hug!&#148;

Mirra almost sighs audibly, feeling Hikaru&#146;s arms wrap around her, 
knowing her secret was safe for at least awhile longer. Still--- 
&#145;IDIOT!!&#146; Mirra spat at herself in her mind, &#145;Don&#146;t let her leave! 
Tell her how you feel! Let her know! Don&#146;t let her leave---&#146; suddenly 
her thoughts faded, as she felt Hikaru&#146;s strong arms caress and cuddle 
her, weakening her strength until Mirra fell asleep in Hikaru&#146;s arms, 
cradled close to her chest feeling the softness of Hikaru&#146;s slowly 
maturing breasts against her head.

Briefly, one last thought passed into Mirra&#146;s mind as she collapsed 
into slumber.

&#145;Tomoyo-mama must have cried herself to sleep each night Sakura-papa 
wasn&#146;t with her when she was Hikaru&#146;s age.&#148;

Hikaru was 12 now, for it was morning and today was her birthday.

And she wanted to celebrate with Mirra at her auntie&#146;s winter home, 
and play in the snow with her.

So that morning they packed up their things into the huge Tech Shuttle 
Nina arrived in so many months ago, and Nina herself piloted the huge 
craft up towards the village where Fuu lived. The trip itself was 
spectacular, especially when Nina equipped both girls with special 
visors which seemingly made most of the shuttle&#146;s cockpit vanish 
allowing a full unobstructed view of the outside. &#147;Wow!&#148; Mirra moaned 
in admiration, watching the world pass them by as the shuttle flew 
upwards into the mountains. Hikaru was as awestruck by the visuals as 
Mirra, both watching in awe as they held hands in their passenger 
seats.

&#147;Can you spare a hand for a drink?&#148; Eliza asked, passing two sodas 
back (one to each of them). She wore the visor too and seemed to glow 
abit as she watched the two open their drinks to take a sip. &#147;Thank 
you, Eliza-chan.&#148; Mirra spoke softly, sipping her drink as the trees 
below whizzed by them below their seats. &#147;Most people get motion sick 
the first time they try the visors.&#148; Eliza noted, &#147;You both must have 
a strong constitution to be able to withstand your first time wearing 
them.&#148;

&#147;Just don&#146;t move about.&#148; Nina warned from her seat. &#147;The appearance of 
motion and the lack of physical references in the cabin (most of the 
cabin is invisible while wearing the visors except for the control 
consoles and the chairs) quickly leads to brief bouts of vertigo.&#148;

&#147;Vertigo?&#148; (Hikaru)

&#147;Think that means a fear of falling or heights. I don&#146;t know, it&#146;s 
just what the computer said when I asked it about first time flyers.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148;

&#147;So---&#148; Eliza motioned to Hikaru as she pulled her own drink out to 
open, &#147;Have you been to Fuu&#146;s place before---? And that&#146;s Fuu as in, 
and not the one that works at the estates, right?&#148;

&#147;Yes. That Fuu. And I&#146;ve been there before only twice. Auntie Fuu 
usually visits us at the house, or I&#146;ve been to her family home, but 
this is my third time to her winter home. I wonder if uncle Ferio is 
there---? Mirra-chan? Have you---?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ve never been to a winter home before, or a summer one for that 
matter. It&#146;s my first time. And---&#148; (gulps) &#147;---it&#146;s my first time 
skiing so forgive me if I embarrass you.&#148;

&#147;You could never embarrass me, Mirra-chan.&#148; Hikaru whispered softly, 
her smile melting Mirra&#146;s cold feeling in her stomach by a little bit.

&#147;How did she get it anyway?&#148;

&#147;She never explained that to me, Nina-chan, she just mentioned she 
loved going up there to ski during the winter months. And for the last 
two years she invites me to come up and visit to go skiing.&#148;

&#147;Then am I going the right way?&#148; Nina remarks, motioning out towards 
the forward end of the shuttle and the direction they were heading.

&#147;Yes, your doing fine. Auntie said she&#145;ll meet us at the small landing 
port for shuttles in town.&#148;

Suddenly Eliza blushes a little, &#147;Sorry to intrude on your outing. 
Nina got us reservations at a nearby resort so we&#146;ll be on hand if you 
need anything. It&#146;s too bad Sakura and Tomoyo couldn&#146;t take the trip 
with us up to the mountains.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, too bad.&#148; Mirra sighed, wishing she had Tomoyo-mama&#146;s love 
wisdom to fall back on if her own attempts at courting Hikaru&#146;s 
affections towards staying with her forever failed. As they reached 
the village Nina took a few minutes to give the town a full pan over 
so the girls could see every part of the village, all the while Hikaru 
was giving a guided tour of the village pointing out places of 
interest.

Finally, she located the shuttle port, (&#147;I was NOT lost! I just wanted 
to give everyone the scenic view of town, that&#146;s all.&#148; Nina griped as 
they landed, though nobody questioned her skill to find the port) and 
they disembarked with luggage in tow into the greeting area where 
people waited to meet arriving shuttles. For a few seconds Hikaru 
wondered to herself if they arrived early, that is before she saw a 
familiar face in the crowd. &#147;Fuu-chan!&#148;

Nina shrugged, remembering Hikaru&#146;s words as they left the shuttle. 
&#147;Auntie Fuu would rather be called just Fuu, Umi-papa says she&#146;s too 
young to be Auntie anything.&#148;

&#147;Whatever floats their boats.&#148; Nina shot off, opening the hatch as she 
lead everyone out, the cargo hatches opening on the side of the 
shuttle allowing easy access to their baggage. &#147;Just as long as she 
doesn&#146;t start calling me Nina-chan or something. It comes to a point 
that I only accept that from people I&#146;m familiar with or just plain 
close to and draw the line on near strangers saying it to me.&#148;

The familiar visage of the glasses wearing third member of the Magic 
Knights came into view, which wasn&#146;t so hard because the greeting area 
was empty except for a couple of people waiting for a shuttle (she was 
behind them buying a book from the newsstand). She was smiling from 
ear to ear, yet it looked like a mature dignified smile over the one 
Nina once saw Umi sporting when she was invited along with &#147;Captain&#148; 
(the name of that woman Hikaru calls &#147;mama&#148; always seems to escape 
Nina&#146;s mind for some reason) for Thanksgiving dinner at the Daidouji 
Estates with Hikaru (Senior being abit off to say about the red haired 
young woman who was younger Hikaru&#146;s namesake), Presea, Fuu, Ferio and 
Mokona in tow. Mokona being of note because Umi nearly threw a fit 
seeing &#147;it&#148; and they had to be separated several times that day before 
property was damaged.

After Thanksgiving she saw very little of Hikaru, she always being 
near Mirra, but she noted a change in her. She became more and more 
energetic and alive near Mirra, and she even changed her hair to match 
her namesake&#146; auntie&#146;s hair which only added more energy to her 
boundless pot of mana in her body. It was as if caring and being with 
Mirra made her much more alive than before, and the two were 
undoubtedly growing closer and closer with each passing day. &#145;It&#146;s 
almost as if she&#146;s already a part of the family.&#146; Nina thought to 
herself, watching Fuu hug Hikaru, the two so happy being together 
again. She then looked up and noticed Mirra, smiling as she bowed and 
greeted her, Mirra returning the greeting sweating abit as she usually 
did when she met Hikaru&#146;s rather odd &#147;family&#148;.

&#145;For someone who isn&#146;t really related, she really does act like 
family---&#146; Nina briefly reflects, noticing everyone&#146;s attention 
turning towards them. She shakes off the dust of the arrival and gives 
her greetings as Eliza does likewise. Fuu greets them as shows them 
towards the outside and the waiting van. In a few minutes they&#146;re 
loaded and on the way.

&#147;Is Uncle Ferio at the house already?&#148;

&#147;He&#146;s there, and he&#145;s probably hurling himself down the slopes again. 
Once you got him that snowboard for Christmas two years ago he hasn&#146;t 
stopped trying to master it--- which I don&#146;t mind as long as I get to 
care for him when he injures himself.&#148; Fuu adds, smiling as she does. 
Hikaru leans back in her spot on the seats and sighs, sweating a 
little. &#147;Uncle Ferio used to hate the snow until I got him a snowboard 
and he started learning how to do it.&#148;

&#147;But he&#146;s still learning.&#148; Fuu adds, &#147;One broken bone at a time.&#148;

Nina smiles, cringing on the inside. &#145;Sheesh. I hope Eliza&#146;s not that 
nonchalant about me when we&#146;re married and I start to snowboard--- or 
anything else in general for that matter--- yeesh!&#146;

&#147;Does he have good health insurance?&#148;

&#147;We have good insurance. I got it after the money started coming in 
from the DVDs/manga sales.&#148;

Nina blinks, sweatdropping, &#147;DVD and manga sales of---&#148; (stops) 
&#147;---oh, right. Magic Knight RayEarth--- or is it Reiearth?&#148;

&#147;Tomoyo-mama mentioned that to me once.&#148; Mirra noted, &#147;I even have the 
entire series in my DVD collection next to my Sakura DVDs. Isn&#145;t the 
second movie out now?&#148;

&#147;Yes. The theatrical live action version of the mangas seemed well 
received after Lord of the Rings came out and the idea of making a 
trilogy of MKRE movies caught on with people (the actor who plays 
Aragorn even is in it--- though I&#145;m afraid of what he (being a Normal) 
must be thinking when he wakes up each morning--- poor thing is 
probably thinking he&#145;s overworked if he even dreams of shooting movies 
in his sleep).&#147; (Suddenly Fuu&#146;s mood shift from slightly embarrassed 
(with soft red blush to boot) as she becomes a bit introspective, 
quickly regards Mirra with a sidewards glance) &#147;But your mother is 
Sakura Kinomoto, right? It must be great to have such a famous mom 
like Sakura.&#148;

&#147;Papa.&#148; everyone (in the know at least) says all at once, bringing a 
curious &#147;?&#148; from Fuu. &#147;Sakura-papa.&#148; Nina remarks, &#147;Sometimes I just 
call her &#147;Snoo&#148;---&#148; (Eliza covers Nina&#146;s mouth before the next word 
comes out). &#147;---oh---&#148; Fuu nods her head, sweatdropping slightly.

------

The place was huge. A two story house that was cozied up against a 
hillside with lots of privacy given by trees surrounding it, and 
several fair sized hills nearby leading down to the village below 
making for a perfect spot to practice one&#146;s boarding or skiing before 
setting of to the slopes.

Fuu was right about one thing. When they arrived at the house nestled 
on a hilltop overlooking a nice set of slopes for skiing, it was clear 
Ferio was thrashing the slopes--- which Nina learned to her dismay as 
she ran out into the snow downhill of the house and was nearly run 
over by Ferio who came off a nearby hill (starting point to one side 
of the house so he didn&#146;t see the van return home), sending Nina 
stumbling into the snow as she watched him make a wild jump over her. 
He hit the snow fairly well, and it could almost have been called 
graceful if not for the slip at the end which landed him on his rear, 
skidding across the snow on his backside for a few feet before coming 
to a stop in a snowbank.

As he laid there, with what looked like a rather warm red blush on his 
face from the fall, Fuu trudged up to him smiling at him. Brushing off 
the snow, and quickly regaining his composure, he trudges up the hill 
with board in hand looking abit sheepish. &#147;I was doing great until you 
came home! You distracted me!&#148;

&#147;I didn&#145;t know I could distract you when I wasn&#145;t in front of you to 
be a distraction.&#148; Fuu smiled, stealing a quick kiss from him which 
caused him to blush. &#147;Hikaru&#146;s here with her friends.&#148; (noting Mirra 
and the others behind her).

Nina, blushing slightly as she shook the snow off from her tumble 
earlier, could only wave abit as she tried to push past Mirra/Hikaru 
(red faced) to get back to the van. Eliza, smiling sheepishly at the 
attention, followed Nina back to the van. They were going to take 
their bags and catch a bus to the resort but Fuu would have none of 
that. She drove them down while the two girls settled into their room.

The room was large, with a giant bed which the two girls planned to 
share. As Mirra hit the bed with one jump, she laughed abit, only to 
stop. &#147;Did you say something?&#148;

&#147;No--- what&#146;s wrong?&#148;

Mirra suddenly blanks out. &#147;Oh, no.&#148; She opens her bag quickly and 
pulls out a half dazed Kero from her backpack. &#147;----&#148; Kero&#146;s eyes were 
spinning, and he didn&#146;t look very healthy. Add to that the fact that 
he probably didn&#146;t fare well when Mirra landed on top of her bag (with 
him in it).

&#147;Kero-chan?&#148; Mirra cried out, placing him on the bed carefully, his 
little body shaking abit. &#147;Are you alright? Speak to me!&#148;

As Hikaru joined her, he slowly began to come to. &#147;W-w-wh-ouch--- make 
the &#145;oom stup&#146; &#145;pinnin&#148;

&#147;What are you doing in my bag?!&#148; Mirra growled, holding Kero up as 
Hikaru made a small &#147;bed&#148; for him to lay in on the cabinet, helping 
Mirra tuck him in gently. &#147;Long story! I--- whoa--- feel sick.&#148;

&#147;You can tell us while you catch your breath.&#148; Mirra frowned, sitting 
on the bed waiting.

Seconds pass, but soon Kero began speaking--- slowly--- mostly to keep 
from getting sick.

He didn&#146;t have a good ride. He was hiding in Mirra&#146;s bag and Nina 
kinda mistreated it while loading it into the shuttle. It didn&#146;t help 
that Kero managed to get out of the bag and slip through a vent into 
the common area, only to find a loose pair of goggles which made the 
room vanish when he looked through them to show the outside--- also 
didn&#146;t help that he flew with the visors in hand, lost his sense of 
coordination, and became suddenly afraid of everything and spent the 
rest of the flight cowering in Mirra&#146;s bag from the disorientation and 
panic attack he had.

Clearly if he didn&#146;t let Sakura talk him into this, none of this would 
have happened.

Or, at least that&#146;s what he told Mirra when she prodded him for 
answers.

-----

Flashback - Kero&#146;s &#147;room&#148;.

Sakura &amp; Tomoyo had a closet converted into a bedroom for Kero to 
sleep in.

At first he was indignant about the idea of sleeping in a 
closet---until he saw it. The &#147;closet&#148; was as big as Sakura&#146;s old 
bedroom at home, and they packed it with a TV, his favorite video game 
system (which he could access through the TV in Sakura/Tomoyo&#146;s 
bedroom or one of three other bedrooms when visiting including Mirra&#146;s 
bedroom), a small fridge for his snacks (which constantly needed 
refilling), a cute bed set into a high place, which he frowned at when 
people called his sleeping area &#147;cute&#148;, and other things to make his 
stay a very comfortable one.

Sakura didn&#146;t go into Kero&#146;s room very much, and only to beg Kero for 
a favor.

Obviously she wanted one now.

&#147;Kero-chan---&#148; Sakura cooed, looking as guilty of something as she 
could without meaning to.

&#147;How many batteries did you swipe out of Tomoyo&#146;s bag this time, 
Sakura?&#148;

&#147;N-no! I didn&#146;t--- I mean, not this time.&#148;

Kero sometimes had to fly to the local Fairy Store to buy batteries 
for Sakura when she occasionally flitched batteries from Tomoyo&#146;s 
camera bag for her Game Boy Advance and didn&#146;t remember to buy new 
ones to replace the ones she lifted. She wasn&#146;t as much as a game 
freak as Kero, but she had to admit that Kero got her hooked on 
certain games (like Animal Crossing) after watching him play on her 
game system (and the many different games she played but didn&#146;t get 
into like Kero) for years. She just didn&#146;t know how to go to the store 
herself at times to replace the batteries she took, and begged Kero 
time and time again to get more before Tomoyo noticed they were 
missing.

Tomoyo always knew, of course, and always made sure to not notice a 
thing when new batteries (sometimes not quite the same brand as the 
ones she had in there originally) made their way into her battery 
pouch in her bag.

&#147;I want you to go with Mirra and keep an eye on her.&#148;

Suddenly the screen shifted and a battle was underway. As Kero worked 
the controller, he gave Sakura a brief yet sharp glance as he punched 
the buttons and made the selections. &#147;On her vacation with Hikaru? To 
go skiing?&#148; Kero asked with a bit of suspicion in his voice, &#147;You 
aren&#146;t implying that I spy on her, are you? After all---&#148;

&#147;No! I just--- I mean---&#148;

&#147;Not worried about whether little Mirra-chan learned the same kind of 
&#147;love&#148; you and Tomo--&#148;

&#147;THAT&#146;S NOT IT!!&#148; Sakura yelled, face blushing bright red. &#147;I&#146;m not 
spying on Mirra&#146;s love life! I just want you to go--- and keep an eye 
on her.&#148;

&#147;Why does that sound like it means spying on her all the same?&#147; 
(Sakura lowers her gaze, still blushing) &#147;Does Tomoyo know about this? 
I&#145;m not going to take the rap if she&#145;s not happy with this.&#148;

&#147;We talked about it---&#148;

&#147;And?&#148;

&#147;And what?!&#148;

Kero sighed as he finished the fight he was in and started moving his 
character again towards the city he was traveling to in the game. &#147;And 
what did Tomoyo say?&#148;

&#147;She said I could ask you to sp--- I mean go with her.&#148;

&#147;AH-HAH!&#148; Kero pounced on her slip, and worked it hard. &#147;She wanted 
you to ask me whether I agreed on this or not! Isn&#146;t that the truth? 
Isn&#146;t it?&#148;

&#147;I--- I guess--- but this is important!&#148;

&#147;Everything&#146;s important when it comes to you peeping into her bedroom 
life.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not true!&#148;

&#147;Oh really----&#148;

End Flashback

-----

Kero suddenly stops, noticing Mirra&#146;s narrowed eyes. &#147;And?&#148;

&#147;And she sent me here.&#148;

&#147;What else?&#148;

It was Kero&#146;s turn to blush now. &#147;What else what?&#148;

&#147;What else? About peeping?&#148;

&#147;Nothing.&#148;

&#147;Kero-chan!&#148;

Kero rolled over in his bed, sweating abit. &#147;I didn&#146;t peep! Honest! 
Sakura&#146;s the one who---&#148; he felt Mirra&#146;s eyes on him, and a dreadful 
feeling that she wasn&#146;t in a good mood right now despite Hikaru&#146;s 
presence. &#147;---I guess I can tell you the one incident---&#148;

&#147;Just one?&#148; she asked, her frustration barely hidden.

&#147;Just one.&#148; Kero confirmed, waiting for Hikaru to get Mirra back onto 
the bed and settled before continuing with his story.

Flashback - Sakura&#146;s Bedroom

Tomoyo walked into the room, noticing the light next to the bed was 
on. Quiet as a mouse she slipped into the closet without Sakura 
noticing. As she slipped out of her school clothes (which she usually 
wore as she worked on editing video in her workshop downstairs) and 
into her jammies in the huge closet she listened and heard two voices 
in the room. 

&#147;Kero-chan&#146;s in the room.&#148; she noted, listening closely.

&#147;And then---?&#148; Sakura whispered, but loud enough for Tomoyo to hear.

&#147;Well--- it&#146;s all pretty hot from there--- the birds sang loudly, the 
bees buzzed, and if I stood long enough to watch it all I&#146;m sure much 
honey would have been made and shared between the two of them.&#148;

&#147;Honey?&#148; Sakura&#146;s voice raised in confusion, &#147;I thought you said they 
were making love?&#148;

&#147;SHEESH!&#148; Kero huffed, &#147;It&#146;s a polite way of saying--- you know!&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;----how old are you, Sakura?&#148;

&#147;Sixteen.&#148;

&#147;Didn&#146;t they teach you the birds and bees in school yet?&#148; Kero spit 
out, huffing his breath. &#147;By now even the girls of my day would know 
these sorts of things!&#148;

&#147;---I was too embarrassed---&#148;

&#147;Kyahh!&#148; Kero groaned, the soft sound of his little body falling into 
the bed making Tomoyo smile. He fainted on Sakura. Seconds later---

&#147;You wanted to know if they were intimate yet and I told you! Why are 
you so---&#148;

&#147;Oh is that what your saying?&#148; Tomoyo announced out loud, entering the 
room. Both of them gasped as they realized they were being listened in 
on. &#147;Tomoyo-chan!&#148;

&#147;Tomoyo--- what a--- pleasant surprise!&#148; Kero squeaked, his wings 
going into overdrive. &#147;I must be going now so I&#146;ll be---&#148;

&#147;What was that about the birds and the bees?&#148; Tomoyo asked, smiling 
sweetly as she motioned for Kero to stay put as she sat down, 
eliciting him to stop his wing flapping as she settled back down 
reluctantly. &#147;Who did the birds sing for, and the bees buzz?&#148;

&#147;Uh--- uhmmm---&#148; Kero looked around, &#147;She asked.&#148; pointing at Sakura 
which brought an angry huff from her, &#147;KERO-CHAN!!&#148; Sakura growled at 
Kero, only to stop as she froze under Tomoyo&#146;s gaze. &#147;Sakura-chan?&#148;

&#147;Uh--- Tomo-chan---?&#148;

&#147;Did you ask Kero to spy on Mirra-chan?&#148;

&#147;I--- well I---&#148; (Sakura quickly collapses into Tomoyo&#146;s arms, crying) 
&#147;I ONLY WANTED TO BE A GOOD PARENT TO OUR MIRRA-CHAN!!&#148;

&#147;There, there, Sakura-chan. You&#145;re a wonderful parent---&#148; (Tomoyo 
comforted her as her gaze locked again on Kero, stopping him from 
leaving) &#147;---Kero-chan?&#148;

&#147;Uhh--- yes?&#148;

&#147;What did you see? Because I saw you in the kitchen eating pudding a 
few minutes ago while I was cleaning the dishes from dinner.&#148;

&#147;KERO-CHAN!!&#148; Sakura growled, turning her gaze onto him as he 
sweatdropped, &#147;YOU SAID YOU SAW---!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s your fault!&#148; Kero growled, taking back to the air flying over 
the bed. &#147;I don&#146;t like spying on Mirra-chan but you&#146;re so 
overprotective! I know they haven&#146;t made love yet because Mirra-chan 
hasn&#146;t blossomed!&#148;

&#147;---phwee?&#148;

----

&#147;Phwee?&#148; Mirra blanked, looking at Kero oddly. &#147;What do you mean, 
blossom?&#148; (Hikaru)

&#147;---nothing--- I just meant Mirra will look older (14-16) when she has 
it for the first time.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148; Mirra asked, confused.

For a minute Kero stopped talking, and the two didn&#146;t know if it was 
because he was stumped, didn&#146;t want to say, or was still motion sick. 
Then--- &#147;When you and Hikaru consummate, your going to feel awkward 
making love in your present form--- you&#146;d want to be like 
Sakura/Tomoyo--- you&#146;ll change, either unconsciously or consciously, 
to a form you feel is mature enough to be a suitable lover for 
Hikaru-chan.&#148;

&#147;When we&#146;re ready?&#148; Hikaru asked.

&#147;When you&#146;re ready.&#148; And, with that, Kero falls into a deep sleep. 
With a slight nod, the two put the bed into a safe hiding place, and 
leave Kero a pudding and a bottle of soda for him to have when he 
wakes up. As Hikaru closes the door, her thoughts are racing. &#147;When 
we&#146;re ready.&#148;

&#147;But Hikaru-chan! When will we be--- ready?&#148;

At that Hikaru smiles, drawing Mirra close and giving her a reassuring 
hug. &#147;We&#146;ll know, precious, we&#146;ll know---&#148;

Mirra smiles, cuddling close as the two sit and bask in each other&#146;s 
warmth. &#147;I hope Sakura-papa stops worrying about me soon---&#148;

-----

Meanwhile

&#147;---choo!&#148; Sakura sneezes, rubbing her nose as she looks about the 
bedroom.

&#147;Do you have a cold?&#148; Naoko asks as she sips her tea. Tomoyo invited 
their friends over to the house for tea and snacks while they studied 
for mid term exams. Sakura shook her head as she felt her nose again, 
&#147;No. I hope nobody&#146;s talking about me.&#148;

&#147;Hopefully they&#146;re saying something good about you, Sakura-chan.&#148; 
Tomoyo added, taking a bite of her pudding as she gave Sakura a 
reassuring smile to calm her down.

At that moment Naoko went back into her ghost story, and Sakura&#146;s calm 
slipped again back into her shivering and crying mode. Tomoyo could 
only smile, and hold Sakura close, as she whimpered from fright as the 
story got scarier and scarier.

-----

The two stepped out of the room at the first sign of arguing.

Below, at the bottom of the stairs, she could hear a familiar voice, 
and she didn&#146;t sound happy.

&#147;Why did he have to collide into me? The nerve! And this is my 
favorite suit too!&#148;

As Hikaru &amp; Mirra reach the bottom of the stairs they run into Fuu, 
smiling calmly, as she whisked a snow suit top to be fixed. In the 
huge living room, Presea sat on the couch in her snow suit pants and a 
soft looking wool sweater (from her bag). She didn&#146;t look too happy. 
&#147;I wanted to snowboard and that thing you call a husband crashed into 
me! And that jacket is a gift from Hikaru-chan----&#148;

&#147;Auntie Pre---&#148; (Before Hikaru could utter another word, Presea 
grabbed her face and squished it a few times as her hands pressed 
against the girl&#146;s cheeks) &#147;I&#146;m too young to be auntie!&#148;

&#147;Pwes---pwes-sweha?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s better.&#148; (lets go) &#147;And this must be Mirra.&#148; (looks at her 
closely, flipping her hair up and checking her jacket) &#147;I don&#146;t see 
any reflective things. Are you sure she&#146;s a Mirror anything?&#148;

&#147;Aun--- I mean Presea!&#148; Hikaru sighed, pulling Mirra back (blushing as 
she is being manhandled by Presea) &#147;Where&#146;s---?&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re going to get dinner!&#148; (the older Hikaru called out, pulling 
Ferio (now dressed for town) behind her. &#147;You want to come along?&#148;

&#147;Not without my favorite jacket that the oaf over there ruined!&#148;

&#147;You shouldn&#146;t have gotten in my way!&#148; Ferio growled, as the two 
stared at each other, only for Hikaru (older) to press herself between 
them, smiling and sweating as she did. &#147;No need to get into a fight 
now, neh? Neh? Neh?&#148;

Presea sighs, leaning towards Hikaru as she does. &#147;Bring me home a 
surprise!&#148; (kisses her)

&#147;Ok. You want something, Hikaru-chan? Mirra-chan? Want to come along?&#148;

&#147;No thanks.&#148;

&#147;Come to think of it---&#148; (Fuu enters the room with the jacket in hand, 
fixed) &#147;---there&#146;s a beautiful little area hidden in the woods near 
the house. It&#146;s a shrine of some kind, and it&#146;s beautiful at this time 
of year. Do you two want to see it?&#148;

&#147;That sounds like fun!&#148; (Mirra is already all hands, her eager body 
pulling Hikaru out the door as the other girl follows her) &#147;We&#146;ll be 
out while everyone&#146;s getting dinner.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not getting dinner without my---&#148; (stops as Fuu hands her her 
jacket) &#147;---oh.&#148;

&#147;It was only a little rip, not destroyed as you said it was. So it was 
easy to fix and---&#148;

&#147;Alright already.&#148; Presea grumbled, standing up quickly and throwing 
her jacket on. &#147;So I got carried away. Whatever. You two coming or 
what? I&#146;m hungry!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m worried---&#148; Fuu suddenly mentioned, &#147;It&#146;s going to be a few hours 
before dinner, and I don&#146;t know if they ate lunch--- are they going to 
be OK?&#148;

&#147;They&#146;ll be fine.&#148; Presea assures her, patting her on the back. &#147;It&#146;ll 
build up their appetite!&#148;

------

&#147;Do you know where the shrine is?&#148; Mirra asked, almost immediately 
after Hikaru walked into the lead and walked right into the forest as 
if she&#146;s done this before. &#147;Yes. It&#146;s just above us.&#148;

As the two walked, the snow thinned, and signs of life not present 
before emerged. As they drew deeper into the small wooded area the 
trees actually seemed to bloom into life until, a few minutes later, 
they were standing in a small area of lush green trees and grass, with 
a small pond dominating the center of the area. The entire area was 
surrounded by a small rock wall, where the snow began again and etched 
outwards from this small area of beauty.

&#147;B-but--- where&#146;s the shrine?&#148;

&#147;This is the shrine, Mirra-chan. This pond.&#148; As Mirra looked on in 
awe, Hikaru strolled over to the lake and knelt down in front of it. 
&#147;This is a natural mana pool.&#148;

&#147;Mana?&#148;

&#147;The planet&#146;s life force. Even in the realm of dreams each world has 
it&#146;s own life and spark. This here is the life force of people&#145;s 
dreams and hopes--- their spiritual &#147;life force&#147; which prays for a 
better world and a bright future for everyone.&#148;

As she motions to the water, Hikaru reaches down and dips a hand into 
the clear crystal blue water. As her hand pulls back up, she draws up 
some water in it, allowing it to slip through her fingers like a 
sparkling blue diamond shower. Each and every drop glittering in the 
soft sunlight, making a soft and beautiful chiming noise as it hit the 
still blue surface causing ripples to form on the pond&#146;s face.

&#147;That&#145;s amazing!&#148; Mirra whispered, awestruck by the spectacle.

&#147;Once a year, on someone&#146;s birthday, the pond grants wishes 
Mirra-chan.&#148;

&#147;Any wish?&#148;

&#147;Only wishes made from a good heart, and with good intentions.&#148; Hikaru 
noted, standing up again. &#147;Isn&#146;t the road to Albuquerque paved in good 
intentions?&#148; Hikaru face faults, recovering quickly as she smiles at 
Mirra&#146;s remarks. &#147;I think you&#146;ve been listening to Kero-chan too much. 
(He&#146;s been a little sillier ever since he&#146;s gotten into Weird Al 
Yankovic).&#148;

Suddenly a new question dawns on Mirra&#146;s mind. &#147;Do you have a wish?&#148;

&#147;To be honest---&#148; (she sighs as she walks up to sit near Mirra, who 
just sat down under one of the huge trees to look at the pond) &#147;---I 
haven&#146;t felt like I had a wish worthy enough of the pond. I knew about 
this pond for two years, but never felt I had a wish worthy of asking 
such a thing of purity---until now.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s your wish?&#148; Mirra asked, only to be gently shushed by Hikaru. 
&#147;It&#146;s a secret for tonight.&#148;

&#147;Secret? What---&#148;

&#147;Is anyone in here?&#148;

The two quickly spin about, shocked, as someone enters the area from a 
different direction. She was a tall woman, with short black hair. She 
wore ski clothes and had a snowboard slung onto her back. Over one 
shoulder she carried a large pack, which she held onto as if it 
carried something precious. &#147;Oh, hi. I&#146;m on holiday and--- are you 
lost? Did you come here by accident?&#148;

&#147;No, I&#146;ve been here before.&#148; Hikaru responded, motioning to the new 
visitor. &#147;And you?&#148;

&#147;Oh I&#146;ve been here once or twice. It&#146;s a great place to take a break 
for lunch--- where did---&#148;

&#147;My auntie has a house over there---&#148; Hikaru motions back the way the 
two came, to which the older woman blinked curiously. &#147;But I never 
knew that couple had child--- oh, you must be--- oh I remember you!&#148; 
(motions to herself) &#147;Don&#146;t you remember me? Last year?&#148;

&#147;No I--- oooohhhh!!!&#148;

The memories fall into place.

Flashback

One Year Ago

Hikaru was putting her snowboard to good use, taking the small hills 
with ease for an early morning practice before going to the large 
slopes with Fuu &amp; Hikaru. It was as she was wrapping up her run that 
she heard a panicked yelp, and a crash. As she ran to see what 
happened, she found Ferio, out cold in the snow, prone on top of a 
female snowboarder in a rather awkward and embarrassing position that, 
if taken the wrong way, would have landed Ferio in the dog house with 
Fuu for at least a few months.

For the most part she seemed rather calm about it.

&#147;I know I should be angry yet--- I can&#146;t help feeling that all this 
blushing and embarrassment from being in this awkward and potentially 
humiliating position is making me feel all warm and toasty on the 
inside--- either that or I&#146;m going numb from shock---&#148;

------

&#147;Hoeee---&#148; Mirra muttered, sweat dropping from the explanation (which 
alone without the visual aids made her feel all embarrassed and red 
from head to toe). &#147;---Hikaru-chan---&#148;

&#147;Oh so THAT&#146;S your name!&#148; the woman suddenly spoke out, pointing at 
the two. &#147;I didn&#146;t catch it the last time. And you are---&#148;

&#147;Mirra. Mirra Daidouji Kinomoto.&#148; (bows) &#147;That&#146;s a cute name. Are you 
two in a hurry?&#148;

The two glance at each other, Mirra shaking her head no. &#147;Well then 
why don&#146;t you two join me for lunch? I got my favorite (&#147;Nikuman&#148;) and 
I don&#146;t mind sharing because I always bring too much up here anyway--- 
always eat more than my share of the stuff. Can&#146;t live without it it 
seems.&#148;

&#147;Okay!&#148;

(Booster Note - Nikuman - Bread baked with a meat filling. 
Offworld-wise it&#146;s a favorite food of Nekochanians and Winterians. 
Nekochanins because it closely resembles a traditional family meal 
eaten by Nekochanians called Myuchi (Me-yue-chee) litterly translated 
as &#147;Table Treat&#147;), Misho NamoCatCat for one is a Nikuman fanatic 
because of it&#146;s similarity to Myuchi. Winterians because it also 
resembles a Winterian food called Gammeri (Gah-mary), which is a 
common snackfood eaten by them (except that Gammeri is packed with 
Ghellmi (Gel-meh) meat which is a strange aquatic rabbit species found 
on Winteria and several colony worlds.))

-----

Back at the house---

It was 6PM when Hikaru &amp; Mirra returned.

&#147;Dinner&#146;s in a few minutes or so, nice to see you made it back.&#148; Fuu 
welcomed them, motioning to the table. &#147;Could you help set the table 
for dinner?&#148;

As they help set up, older Hikaru watched them as she cooked the meal. 
&#147;How was the walk?&#148;

&#147;The shrine was beautiful!&#148; Mirra remarked happily, suddenly 
remembering their new friend, &#147;We met a nice woman there. She was 
snowboarding and stopped there for lunch and she shared with us.&#148;

Fuu smiled, leaning over near Hikaru as she did. &#147;I&#146;m glad you two 
made such a nice friend--- Hikaru?&#148; (nudges her slightly) &#147;Don&#146;t 
forget.&#148;

&#147;I won&#146;t. I&#146;ll be there.&#148;

&#147;Ok. Are you---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure, Fuu-chan. I&#146;m sure.&#148; And, with that said, she went back to 
setting the table. Mirra was on cloud nine so she didn&#146;t notice, but 
during the meal she felt as if there was something she should ask, but 
didn&#146;t know what to say. All her thoughts could focus on was her 
inability to ask Hikaru to stay with her forever--- maybe Tomoyo-mama 
had some good advice?

------

&#147;Hello, Daidouji Residence.&#148;

&#147;Tomoyo-mama? It&#146;s me! Mirra!&#148;

&#147;Mirra-chan! I---&#148; (voice softens, as if blushing) &#147;I know I shouldn&#146;t 
ask, but is Kero-chan with you over there by any chance?&#148;

Mirra puts the phone against the closet door, where the sound of 
Kero&#146;s GBA raging away on a game could be heard. &#147;Oh. He&#146;s there.&#148; 
(silence, which Mirra took for Tomoyo blushing) &#147;I&#146;m sorry. Sakura 
meant well but I wish Kero didn&#146;t let her talk him into this.&#148;

&#147;I know she&#146;s worried about me. But I wish she&#146;d not worry so.&#148;

&#147;I know. I&#146;m sorry---&#148; (voice raises again in volume but is still 
soft) &#147;How&#146;s the mountains? Did you have a chance to do any boarding 
yet?&#148;

&#147;Tomorrow. But Tomoyo-mama--- Hikaru&#146;s acting kind of--- well--- 
weird.&#148;

&#147;How so?&#148;

Mirra fidgeted, trying to find the words. &#147;There&#146;s this mystical 
spring near where we live--- and it grants wishes to someone on their 
birthday.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s a nice spring. Does it work year &#145;round?&#148;

&#147;Yes---&#148; (Mirra sweatdrops) &#147;---but I&#146;m worried. She&#146;s going to make a 
wish tonight, I&#146;m sure of it--- but what is she going to wish? What if 
she&#146;s in love with--- someone else--- and she wishes to be with them 
forever? I--- I&#146;m scared!&#148;

&#147;I thought you two were close.&#148;

&#147;We are! But I&#146;m not even brave enough to tell her that I want her to 
stay with me forever! What if she&#146;s tired of waiting for me? What if 
she found someone better? Whose braver than I am? What if---?&#148;

&#147;Mirra-chan.&#148; Tomoyo stops, thinks, then her voice returns seconds 
later. Mirra shaking as she listens carefully and hangs on each word. 
&#147;Trust her. If you both love each other as deeply as I know you do, 
you won&#146;t lose her. I promise.&#148;

&#147;Tomoyo-mama---&#148;

&#147;I wish I could have been there to see this spring! It sounds 
marvelous--- what does the water taste like?&#148;

&#147;Water.&#148; Mirra blanked out, the question confusing her. &#147;It just 
tasted like water. Trisha gave us some to taste and it tasted normal.&#148;

&#147;Trisha?&#148;

&#147;A new friend I met today. She knows about the pond too, and likes to 
eat Nikuman while sitting under a tree near the pond.&#148;

&#147;Sounds like you made a new friend.&#148; (Tomoyo&#146;s voice seemed to cheer 
up as she heard that) &#147;That&#146;s great. It&#146;s too bad the Studio wants 
these new episodes ready sooner than expected or I&#146;d be there with you 
now--- I kinda feel like a Nikuman now actually.&#148;

&#147;Good luck with the deadline, Tomoyo-mama.&#148;

&#147;SAVE ME SOME NIKUMAN WHEN I GET HOME!&#148; (Kero)

&#147;Thanks. And tell Kero-chan there&#146;ll be plenty of Nikuman for him when 
he gets home. I&#146;ll call you tomorrow to see how your doing. Good 
night, precious.&#148;

&#147;Good night---&#148;

As Mirra turned to retrieve her nighties, she ran into Hikaru who 
gently tugs her by the hand and leads her to the door. &#147;Where are we 
going?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s time. I&#146;m going to make my wish--- and I want you there with 
me.&#148;

&#147;Phwee?&#148;

It&#146;d be a bit of a walk, with them taking it slow in the dark.

&#145;This is it! My big chance to tell her I want her to be with me 
forever---&#146; Mirra thought to herself, her fists clenched as she let 
Hikaru dress her for outdoors, her body warming as she walked to the 
door leading out to the hallway. &#145;If only the rest of my body would do 
what my mind is set on doing!&#146;
