------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several months passed after Syaoran and Sakura have been a couple. It&#39;s after school.
Tomoyo and Sakura are walking home together. 

Tomoyo casually asks, &quot;Sakura chan, you have something planned for this weekend with
Syaoran san?&quot; 

Sakura&#39;s head is down, contemplating. 

Tomoyo gently shakes her friend&#39;s arm:&quot;Sakura chan.&quot; 

Sakura&#39;s head picks up, &quot;Huh? Oh, he has soccer practice this Saturday so...&quot; A soft sigh
follows. 

Tomoyo, alarmed, comforts Sakura:&quot;Syaoran san is trying to socialize more with others in
his class. That&#39;s why he joined team sports. He&#39;s more out going now. Isn&#39;t he? He&#39;s been
changing a lot FOR YOU, ne.&quot; 

Sakura murmurs, &quot;yeah...but he shouldn&#39;t have to. I mean, aren&#39;t couples just &quot;meant to be
soul mates&quot;? Look at Onii san and Yukito san, they just, they just match. They don&#39;t have
to change their personalities, and so on. But we, I almost start every conversation. And the
places he takes me to, I like the things he plans, but when I tell him &#39;let&#39;s try this!&#39; he 
agrees, yes, he ALWAYS agree with me. He never upsets me. But sometimes I feel that he 
doesn&#39;t like my &#39;wild side&#39;. But he says he likes me because I&#39;m different.&quot; Sakura slows 
down her steps, turns to her best friend for advice. 

Tomoyo&#39;s eyes are full of concern but her voice is calm,&quot; Sakura chan, boys and girls are 
supposed to like different things. When you go out, you two have to compromise. That&#39;s 
how a relationship lasts. He may be a bit more reserved and cautious, but Syaoran san is 
right. You are different. You can learn from each other, ne. After all, what really matters 
is, that he cares about you; you can trust him; and you can count on him to protect you 
regardless of what danger lies ahead.&quot; Tomoyo finishes her speech with a reassuring smile, 
but WHO is she trying to convince? {I care about Sakura too; she can trust me too. Why
can&#39;t I---BUT I CAN&#39;T PROTECT HER. LOOK WHAT I WAS DOING WHEN THE 
CLOW CARDS ATTACKED HER. SYAORAN SAN BATTLED WITH HER. I JUST 
VIDEOTAPED! And, I can never provide Sakura a family...} 

Sakura is still absorbing the complex advice Tomoyo has given her when she suddenly 
catches sight of Tomoyo&#39;s sad expression: &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Tomoyo chan? You&#39;re worrying 
about me and Syaoran san? Oh, Tomoyo chan...&quot; Sakura is deeply touched. She naturally 
reaches out and holds her friend&#39;s hand gently, but firmly. Unfortunately, her act of 
gratitude and friendship only causes Tomoyo&#39;s heart to twitch. 

Tomoyo turns her eyes away, fearing any further revelation of her emotions. But her voice 
betrays her anyway when she says, &quot;Sakura chan, don&#39;t worry about me. It&#39;s YOU TWO 
I&#39;m worrying about. Syaoran san is a quiet person. If there&#39;s a problem, you got to call him 
up first. He may seem tough, but he&#39;s soft inside. Remember be tactful when you bring up 
any suggestions.&quot; 

Sakura:&quot;Tactful? Hoe? Such as...?&quot; Tomoyo has a sweat drop now ^_^ &quot;Sakura chan, if 
you don&#39;t mind, really, it&#39;s between the two of you, but I can be the messenger for you two 
if you can&#39;t figure out what to say to him...&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s heart races when she offers her 
help. All these months Sakura and Syaoran have been going out, Tomoyo has almost been 
like a &quot;movie extra&quot; who had no schedule as to when or where to meet with Sakura. If she 
can participate somehow in the relationship, doing something special for Sakura, she 
would DIE FOR IT. After all, she chose Syaoran for her. If it turns out to be a wrong 
match and Sakura&#39;s heart breaks, Tomoyo cannot possibly forgive herself. 

&quot;Ok, I guess...&quot; Sakura accepted her friend&#39;s help. {Well, relationships are private matters 
and telephone 3-way conference is DEFINITELY not the thing, but I guess Tomoyo is a 
better speaker than I. Maybe I&#39;ll just ask her what to say and then tell Syaoran san 
myself.} 

It&#39;s a sunny Saturday. The soccer field is empty now that the players have finished their 
practice. Sakura fiddles with her purse, waiting at the school gate for Syaoran to have 
their discussion, as per Tomoyo&#39;s cleverly drafted instructions. Syaoran quickly spotted 
the brown haired girl and walked towards her. 

The couple is facing each other. Sakura stumbles with words: &quot;Hi, Syaoran san, can we---
do you have time? How about we go to the park? I---&quot; 

Syaoran:&quot;Sure, I have something to talk to you too.&quot; Then the silent couple walks to the 
park. 

Today is different. Syaoran speaks first:&quot;Sakura san...if I...if I hadn&#39;t come back from 
Hong Kong, would you, would you have met someone else?...Maybe you would have met 
someone else wonderful?&quot; 

Sakura is totally thrown out of rhythm. Forget about the lines Tomoyo has given her. This 
is too much of a blow. Syaoran hardly ever asks things, especially personal things, so 
directly. The tone is not accusing, rather doubtful of himself. 

Sakura:&quot;What? Where does that come from?? Someone else? Who? Wonderful? You&#39;re 
not wonderful? Syaoran san, I only want to go out with you---is it Yamamura senpai? 
[senpai is an honorific suffix for schoolmates or colleagues senior to you] He&#39;s just been 
showing me how to skate board and his sports collections. Those weren&#39;t dates! You trust 
me don&#39;t you?&quot; 

Syaoran:&quot; Of course I trust you, Sakura san. It&#39;s not that. I&#39;m just saying, I&#39;m just 
proposing, if I was never there to meet you again, wouldn&#39;t you have found someone else 
who would make you happier? I&#39;ve changed a lot. And I&#39;m willing to do it for you. But it&#39;s 
still the same me. It always will. Maybe, maybe...&quot; 

Sakura, frustrated, not understanding where all these ideas have come from, finishes the 
sentence for Syaoran:&quot; we don&#39;t match? Is that what you&#39;re trying to say? Who matches 
then? Like onii san {brother} and Yukito san? Tomoyo chan says, doesn&#39;t really matter 
we&#39;re different, as long as we care about each other, and trust each other and, and---&quot; In 
the midst of panic, Sakura searches for exactly what Tomoyo&#39;s advice was. However, 
Syaoran has a mind of his own:&quot; What else did Tomoyo san say? You listen to everything 
Tomoyo san tell you?&quot; 

Sakura can&#39;t deal with so many questions shooting at her all at once, especially most of 
them are so pointed. Sakura loses her calm: &quot;Syaoran san, stop. I don&#39;t know. What&#39;re you 
trying to say?? I can&#39;t talk to Tomoyo chan when I have problems? Who else will I talk to? 
Sometimes when we&#39;re together, I feel like I&#39;m talking to a stone wall. You&#39;re so wrapped 
up. Our relationship is private, I know, but I have no one except her. Besides, she always 
understands.&quot; 

Syaoran flatly asks,&quot;and I don&#39;t?&quot; Silence fills the air afterwards. 

Syaoran knows he talks too much today. He&#39;s not good at speech in the first place, let 
alone deep thoughts and emotional topics, with the one he cares so much about. He 
probably has confused her, maybe even hurt her. He&#39;d better stop talking now. He intently 
looks at Sakura, and told her that he is sorry, he probably said too much, and he&#39;d need 
some time to think over this entire situation. He&#39;ll call her soon. Out of genuine concern, 
he reaches out his hand and offers to walk her home. However, Sakura was already deep 
into the pit of confused anger, and she flatly refuses his offer, saying that she will be fine,
and starts to skate away, in the direction of Tomoyo&#39;s mansion. 

Tomoyo is stunned when the servant leads the completely drenched Sakura into the 
guestroom. Sakura is not only shaking with coldness, but her left knee is bleeding. She 
must have slipped while she was skating to the mansion. Being overwhelmed by the pain 
Sakura must be suffering, Tomoyo embraces her dear friend for almost an eternity. Slowly 
she releases her arms, and reassures Sakura that no matter what happened, she will make it 
better for her. After being carefully (and lovingly) bandaged by Tomoyo, Sakura is led to 
the bathroom to take a shower. 

&quot;Kiya~&quot; Screams of pain from the bathroom send Tomoyo rushing to the door, knocking 
the door violently:&quot;Sakura chan! Are you alright?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Tomoyo chan, I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just that the warm water sprinkles on my bandage but the 
wound still hurts~&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Sakura chan, gomen ne [sorry], you do need to wash your wound. But try cover it 
with a cloth so the water won&#39;t come in direct contact with your knee.&quot; 

&quot;Ok, I&#39;ll try that. Hm...It&#39;s better now. Oh, Tomoyo chan, thanks. I don&#39;t know what to do 
without you. I&#39;m sorry I ran into your home like this. I, I...&quot; {words can&#39;t express how I 
feel...Tomoyo chan. Can&#39;t you read my thoughts? my pain? I hope you understand, &#39;cuz 
seems like no one else does} 

&quot;Sakura chan, I&#39;m glad you made it here. It&#39;s pouring outside. You should have called me 
and I could have picked you up wherever. You still have my cell phone right? Don&#39;t worry. 
When you come out, we&#39;ll talk things out, what ever it is.&quot; {You see, there&#39;re so many 
things I still have to help you with, like picking the wedding dress, choosing baby clothes, 
etc. When one day you finally grow up and don&#39;t need me anymore, you can forget me. 
You can lose touch with me. I&#39;ll let go. I promise. Our memories will be enough. I&#39;ll 
always be there...} Tomoyo collapses by the door, but quickly comes back to her senses 
and stands up again. 

After the shower, Sakura&#39;s cheeks return to their usual rosy color, but still lost their shine. 
Her eyes are drooping too. Tomoyo carefully analyses the conversation between Sakura 
and Syaoran at the park:&quot; I think he&#39;s critical of himself, not you. He expects a lot from 
himself, believing that you deserve more happiness than he&#39;s giving you right now. I guess 
he&#39;s a believer of &quot;soul mate&quot; theory too? I don&#39;t think he minds that you share your 
problems with me. After all, I&#39;m the matchmaker and I hold some responsibility for the 
outcome of your relationship. Maybe he wishes that you can turn to him for answers, 
instead of turning to me.&quot; 

Sakura&#39;s eyes are wide open:&quot; He&#39;s jealous? Of you, not Yamamura senpai? You&#39;re the best 
companion to talk to, that&#39;s what best friends are for. I can&#39;t turn to him for a lot of things, 
girl stuff for example. No, he got it wrong. I can and I should still talk to you. But he&#39;s 
gotta change---&quot; Sakura realizes her own hypocrisy. She&#39;s just told Syaoran moments ago 
that being different is actually good, that they can learn from each other. Then she wishes 
him to be more open like she. {WE DON&#39;T MATCH??} &quot;Maybe we don&#39;t match. Syaoran 
san says so too.&quot; 

Tomoyo&#39;s heart twitches. {No, that can&#39;t be. I didn&#39;t? Did I? With my own hands, I push 
my only love into failure? A first love that ends with a sour note?} Tomoyo holds up 
Sakura&#39;s head, and promises to call Syaoran and straighten things out. 

Ring---ring. Syaoran drags himself out of the bed for the phone. But the answering 
machine is activated when Syaoran hesitantly reaches out for the receiver. {What if it&#39;s 
Sakura san? what should I say or ask?} It&#39;s Tomoyo&#39;s voice, a bit shaken, which is 
unusual:&quot; Hello, this is Daidouji Tomoyo. Syaoran san, if you&#39;re in please pick it up. It&#39;s 
important. Sakura is at my house. She&#39;s hurt---&quot; Syaoran&#39;s voice interrupts the recording, 
just as Tomoyo expected:&quot; What? Tomoyo san? Sakura what? Is she alright?&quot; 

Tomoyo, still nervous about if she can fix the problem, keeps Syaoran in suspense:&quot; 
Syaoran san, it&#39;s good that I can get a hold of you. She&#39;s fine, but she&#39;s bleeding. She says 
you want her to try going out with some one else.&quot; She twists the story enough to make 
sure she can get a response from the reserved Syaoran, who, usually doesn&#39;t clear things 
right out. Surprisingly, this time the strategy backfires. 

The tactic goes smoothly at first. Syaoran does deny that he wants to break up with 
Sakura, and confirms that he loves her.
Tomoyo can&#39;t believe what she hears next though: &quot;I just feel that maybe I&#39;m not the one 
for her. I mean, just because, we, went through a lot of troubles and dangers together 
and...but on a normal day, would she pick me to hang out with? Like, I came back for her 
because my life is boring without her. I need her smile. I need her. But when we&#39;re 
together, it&#39;s like, we don&#39;t---&quot; 

&quot;Stop. Syaoran kun.&quot; Syaoran is shocked by Tomoyo&#39;s bluntness. She&#39;s never like that. 
Tomoyo goes on, without any apology:&quot; Sakura chan is still young. When she matures, the 
distance between you two---no, the distance between a man and a woman will lessen, I 
believe, because the older you get, the more experience you have with how to get along 
with others, and understanding WILL grow. You got to be patient. It&#39;s a long term 
relationship remember? When you weren&#39;t sure about how you felt at first, remember I 
encourage you on to &#39;try it&#39;? I don&#39;t mean by &#39;just try it once&#39;. Love takes a long time to 
nurture. It&#39;s the hardest plant to grow---&quot; 

This time it&#39;s Syaoran interrupting:&quot; Tomoyo san please. I know you were the matchmaker 
and you probably felt responsible for whatever happens between the two of us, but, this is 
between me and Sakura san. I&#39;m just thinking, if we need so much help from you and 
others, that Sakura san and I have to involve so much and so many people to keep it all 
together, is it worth it? Is it fair to her? And how come you&#39;ve chosen me to match with 
Sakura san? What makes you think that I&#39;m the one?&quot; 

&quot;Because you care about her. You protected her. I can see how much you&#39;ll cherish her if 
she belongs to you. I entrusted her, my dear friend, to you.&quot; {oh~what is this feeling? It&#39;s 
panic. No way, I never panic. But he&#39;s losing her. I&#39;m losing Sakura&#39;s happiness. I have to 
keep trying.} 

&quot;Urh~Tomoyo san, thanks for calling, and helping us out. I&#39;ll come to look after her 
wound, but is she in the mood to see me?&quot; 

&quot;OF COURSE SHE IS! That&#39;s great news! I&#39;ll send a car to pick you up then.&quot; Tomoyo 
hangs up before Syaoran has the chance to speak further, fearing that he may change his 
mind. Tomoyo&#39;s voice is a bit too excited, Syaoran thinks to himself. 

While Syaoran is getting himself ready, many thoughts run through his mind. {Thanks to 
Tomoyo, what a great mediator. What would we do without her? Come to think of it, she&#39;s 
a bit possessive of Sakura&#39;s problems. Oh well, they&#39;re best friends since childhood. But 
isn&#39;t it odd she&#39;s acting like it&#39;s her own relationship as if she&#39;s got so much free time---no, 
she has private tutor lessons for music and other subjects, plus choir practice, and going 
out---with Sakura and other friends. No boyfriend yet for her, hm...she does get a lot of 
chocolate on Valentine&#39;s Day from boys of different classes and grades, though it&#39;s not 
really the right day for boys to give out chocolate. Boys give out chocolate on March 14 
the &quot;white day&quot;. Hm, she does give out chocolate to---to Sakura?! Ah...and 
she...videotapes Sakura. Uh~this is, this is THAT?!} Syaoran&#39;s thoughts are interrupted
by the door bell. Tomoyo&#39;s guards have come to pick him up. 

On his way to Tomoyo&#39;s mansion, Syaoran has made a painful decision. {How could she 
have lived like that? How has she managed to restrain herself from embracing the one she 
loves so dearly? To hide her tears, her emptiness and all. How brave for a girl to endure 
such pain. If that&#39;s the case, I can&#39;t take advantage of Sakura san&#39;s ignorance of the 
situation and keep our relationship. I want to be a real winner, with Sakura san choosing 
me after she makes an informed decision. She deserves a choice and Tomoyo san deserves 
a chance. She cares about Sakura san just as much---or maybe even more than I do...} 

When Syaoran arrives, Tomoyo allows some privacy for the couple in the guest bedroom. 
Syaoran tenderly attends to Sakura&#39;s wounds so Sakura keeps quiet to enjoy the sweet 
moment. Then Syaoran&#39;s face darkens. He frankly tells Sakura that there&#39;s another person 
who is in love with Sakura. Therefore, they should be apart for a week as a test to see 
whom Sakura misses the most. Whoever that is would be the one she should love. Sakura 
is completely disturbed by the proposition and bombards Syaoran with one single 
question, &quot;why?&quot; Syaoran realizes that Sakura can be quite dense sometimes when it 
comes to delicate matters. Then again he does not want to expose Tomoyo&#39;s true feelings 
without consent. So he insists on protecting the identity of the secret admirer, only 
stressing that Sakura deserves a choice and that admirer, who &quot;has always been there for 
you in both rain and shine&quot; should have a chance. That said, Syaoran quickly leaves the 
distraught Sakura, lest himself will break down in tears and revert his proposal. 

That night, Syaoran goes home very late and even turns off his phone to avoid Sakura. 
Meanwhile, Sakura tosses and turns on her bed, wondering who can be as worthy as 
Syaoran to win her love. {If I can&#39;t find anyone else who&#39;s just as wonderful, I guess I have 
proved that Syaoran is the only one and we should be together. But I got to stay strong. I 
can&#39;t make everyone worry about me. But I can&#39;t do this myself. I need someone to talk 
to.} Out of reflex, Sakura dials up Tomoyo&#39;s phone number. Tomoyo can&#39;t sleep either. 
Her heart is filled with guilt. {Sakura is old enough now. She&#39;ll probably understands my 
feelings. She didn&#39;t react negatively to Touya san and Yukito san. Maybe it&#39;s ok to tell 
her.} 

Ring---ring &quot;Hello? Sakura chan?&quot; Tomoyo answers the call right away, since the cell 
phone is by her bed. [How obsessive.] 

&quot;Tomoyo chan~what should I do? What if I can&#39;t find that person? Syaoran kun is all I 
have~&quot; 

&quot;Sakura, I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s all my fault. I thought you&#39;d be happy with him but it turns out like 
this. You want to know who else admires you? I&#39;ll tell you. Wanna come over to my 
house?&quot; 

&quot;Tomoyo chan, You found out? OH~you&#39;re the best! I&#39;ll come right now!&quot; click. Sakura 
can&#39;t even wait for Tomoyo&#39;s ride. She just skates right over to the mansion. 

&quot;So, who is it?&quot; Sakura shoots out the question as soon as she arrives. Tomoyo&#39;s eyes are 
fixed upon Sakura, with a strange sense of determination. &quot;Sakura chan, come.&quot; She leads 
her clueless friend into the bedroom, and shows her the box once again. &quot;Remember this 
eraser you&#39;ve given me? Everything you gave me: notes, UFO catcher dolls, stickers, I keep 
them. I videotaped you, because I don&#39;t want to lose any memory of you. Sakura, you&#39;re the 
most important person to me. I never try to hide it from you. You&#39;re just too young to 
understand. I don&#39;t blame you. You&#39;re so innocent. That&#39;s what I like about you. I like 
everything about you.&quot; Sakura&#39;s eyes widen. 

Tomoyo takes a deep breath and continues, &quot;Sakura, there&#39;re not many girls like me. So I 
sort of assume that you&#39;ll need a boyfriend someday. I look around, and found Syaoran 
san. He&#39;s a wonderful boy. I know I find happiness when my love finds happiness. Sakura, 
are you angry at me? I cause so much confusion between you and Syaoran san. I&#39;ll be there 
for you, whenever and wherever, as long as you need me.&quot; Tomoyo finishes her 
confession, closes her eyes, and waits for the verdict from Sakura. Tomoyo has really spelt 
it out this time. She even dropped the &quot;chan&quot; suffix, which is used commonly among
childhood friends. To call someone with first name only means either rudeness or 
intimacy. 

Neither one speaks. There are no signs of disgust, anger, or even discomfort from Sakura&#39;s 
face. Instead she leans forward to Tomoyo, looking intently at her friend with awe, 
gratefulness and guilt. Someone has always been there for Sakura, through rain and shine. 
Someone is hopelessly in love with Sakura, yet joyfully accepts the destiny. She embraces 
loneliness, regardless of her complete devotion of time and energy. That someone, is 
Tomoyo. Sakura breaks into tears, and then a smile. She strokes Tomoyo&#39;s face gently: 
&quot;Tomoyo, you&#39;re the greatest gift I have. When I was little, I wanted a sister, and there you 
were. I needed a best friend. There you were. When I look back, the happiest days of my 
life is childhood, when there&#39;s nothing I have to worry. Otou san [dad] and onii san 
[brother] sheltered me. So did you. You always came up with a way to help me, cheer
me in one way or another. When we entered junior high, there&#39;re so many changes I had to 
face, but not alone, because of you. Tomoyo, you&#39;re perfect. Sometimes I think I should be 
more like you, smart, elegant, mature. But you always have a way of making me feel 
special, that I am just perfect being the way I am. Before I met Syaoran, my life was 
happy. Why do I keep thinking I have to have him? Because I&#39;m older? Because I need a 
boyfriend? I need romance?&quot; 

Tomoyo puts a finger on Sakura&#39;s lips: &quot;Sakura, you need a family. You need someone to 
protect you too. Syaoran san can provide that for you. I can&#39;t. I was all you need when you 
were young. But as time goes by, needs change. Sakura, I&#39;m grateful you accepts what I 
am, but please don&#39;t push yourself for me.&quot; 

&quot;When Syaoran told me he noticed another admirer deserves my love, I had no idea what 
he meant. And I was hoping that person would turn out to be someone not so dear to me, 
so that the choice would be easier. But it turned out to be you...&quot; Sakura&#39;s eyes looked 
around the room, which is walls of videotape collections and hanged group photos of her, 
Tomoyo, Naoko, Rika and Chiharu. Indeed, childhood is a beautiful place to stay. One 
must grow away from it though. 

Tomoyo squeezes out a smile, and pulls herself away, &quot;Sakura chan, gomen ne, I&#39;m making 
this difficult for you to choose. I&#39;ve always promised myself not to be a burden to you. 
Don&#39;t worry. We can stay as friends ^_^ You go ahead and let Syaoran know that he has 
nothing to worry about, ok? If you want, we can all meet together and straighten things 
out, whatever misunderstanding is going on between the two of you. Ii de shou [alright]?&quot; 

Sakura stares at her friend, unsure of how much pain her friend is hiding. The meeting is 
going nowhere to any solid resolution, so Tomoyo urges Sakura to go home by her car and 
leave the decision to tomorrow. 

The next evening, Sakura leaves a message on Syaoran&#39;s phone, letting him know the 
progress: she knows the admirer is Tomoyo but she needs some time before she makes the 
decision. 

{Who can I talk to? When I was rejected by Yukito, Syaoran lent me his shoulders. When 
I have fights with Syaoran, I turn to Tomoyo chan. Now both of them&#39;re competing. I need 
advice from, from Onii san! He can help. He teases me, but he always protects me.} The 
thought of Touya&#39;s often stern but concerned face gives Sakura a momentary relief. 

[In Sakura&#39;s room] Sakura: &quot;Onii san, either one of them would be heart broken. I know 
how it feels, being rejected...&quot; {flashbacks of Yukito confessing to Sakura that he&#39;s really 
in love with someone else} &quot;Even someone as gentle as Yukito san didn&#39;t make the 
rejection sound any softer. I can&#39;t forgive myself hurting the ones I care so much for. I 
wish I knew the right one from the start. That way, I wouldn&#39;t involve so many people, 
crying for me.&quot; Sakura holds her head tight, weeping. 

Touya frowns even deeper, pads her little beloved sister&#39;s head and soothes her, &quot;Sakura, 
I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve broken your heart. Neither of us meant to lead you on. I didn&#39;t notice I loved 
Yuki until later, and Yuki couldn&#39;t see it in your eyes. Strange isn&#39;t it? Love, so strong; it 
runs deep inside you like blood flowing in your body. You feel the pulse, but you don&#39;t 
always stop and think about it. It takes time to sit down and think hard to realize what 
others have been doing for you, especially when you&#39;re busy thinking about someone, first 
Yuki, then Syaoran. I&#39;m sure Tomoyo forgives you for missing her out.&quot; 

Sakura: &quot;Onii san, about the &#39;love is like blood running deep inside&#39;, that&#39;s deep thoughts, 
you came up with that?&quot; 

Touya, startled, coughs, &quot;Ah, Hm---you caught me ^_&lt; Kaho told me that when I was 
reconciling with her about who we really love. By the way, I don&#39;t regret the time I spent 
with her. She was loving, and I&#39;ve learned much about life from her. Through love one 
grows, no matter how painful it is. You learn to be self-less, different, open and trust 
others, and brave too. So whoever you choose, fear no pain or guilt, because the day you 
open your heart to someone, you should have the courage to face anything. It&#39;s not your 
fault that you didn&#39;t pick the right one, or you didn&#39;t notice who loves you. Most people 
make wrong choices before they find the right one, and it takes two to make a relationship 
go down. And don&#39;t think that you&#39;ll lose one of them forever, because I believe both of 
them will stay as your friends anyway.&quot; 

Sakura, amazed by her brother&#39;s sudden profound wisdom {guess I haven&#39;t ever had a 
heart-to-heart talk with Onii san---didn&#39;t know he&#39;s THAT smart; always thought Yukito 
san was smarter ^_&lt; } asks her brother further: &quot;So should I stay with Syaoran san, or 
leave and try a new life with Tomoyo chan? What makes you realize that you got to be 
with Yukito san?&quot; 

Touya thinks for a moment, then replies firmly, &quot;When you can&#39;t think of living another 
day not seeing that person---that is, everyday wherever you go, whatever you do and think, 
that person is PART OF YOU, like the blood flows in you. It&#39;s there, but you don&#39;t see it, 
but you feel the pulse. If it goes away, you REALLY feel empty and can&#39;t move on. It&#39;s 
scary at first, when I noticed that how much I have been depending on Yuki. But then I 
was glad, I found someone special. I&#39;m not living on the earth alone. Someone is with me. 
When Otou san [father] dies, and you get married off, I&#39;ll still have someone, Yuki, by my
side. Sakura, you&#39;ve got to have the guts to try. Doesn&#39;t matter if it turns out the wrong 
one, find you soul mate. It&#39;s worth all the journey.&quot; 

&quot;Arigatou, Onii san. I kinda understand what you mean by &#39;soul mate&#39; now.&quot; {I feel the 
inertia to change, but it has to be that way I guess.} 

&quot;Gomen ne, Syaoran san, made you waited these few days.&quot; 

It is a sunny afternoon, but Syaoran can feel the clouds around him. Before him stands 
Sakura, the soon-to-be ex-girlfriend. She chose her. He can tell. Sakura is a passionate 
person. If she has chosen him, she would have already moved closer, why the guilty 
distance? Syaoran, a gentleman from start to finish, breaks the silence. 

&quot;Sakura san, it&#39;s...okay. I am prepared for either way. Your happiness is the most 
important. That&#39;s why I insisted you look into the alternate admirer. You deserve the best. 
If anything goes wrong in the future, please tell me, I&#39;ll do my best being your confidante.&quot; 
Tears betray Syaoran&#39;s smile. He wipes them away, and gives the hesitant Sakura a strong, 
last hug. Sakura cries on Syaoran&#39;s shoulders, but this time, it&#39;s departure. 

&quot;Syaoran san~ gomen ne, Tomoyo chan---Tomoyo needs me. I need her too. Please don&#39;t 
wait for me. That would be too much to ask. Syaoran san, I&#39;ll take my chance. Please don&#39;t 
wait for me like Tomoyo did. It&#39;s too awful.&quot; Syaoran hesitates to promise this request. It&#39;s 
impossible to forget Sakura, at least for now. Syaoran whispers into her ear softly, &quot;Sakura, I 
can&#39;t forget you. But I promise that if someone wonderful loves me, I&#39;ll give her a chance, 
ok?&quot; Sakura closes her eyes with tears of relief and gratitude, &quot;Thank you, Syaoran san.&quot; 

Looking from a distance, Tomoyo can&#39;t make out what words have been exchanged 
between the couple. She only sees the tight embrace, then the parting of the two, with 
Syaoran&#39;s head down, a clear sign of defeat. Tomoyo&#39;s heart is now divided between guilt 
and excitement. {I&#39;m sorry Syaoran kun. I was the matchmaker and look what I&#39;ve done to 
you. But, what can make Sakura possibly choose me? I&#39;m a great friend, but can I be all 
that to her? Oh~ I just hope she didn&#39;t choose on impulse.} 

Sakura quickly spotted Tomoyo and skips over to her side. {Hoe, what should I say?} 
&quot;...Tomoyo chan---hn, To-mo-yo, gomen ne, I made you wait. I hurt Syaoran. I was dumb. 
This time, I hope...I won&#39;t hurt you!&quot; Sakura swiftly takes Tomoyo&#39;s hand by surprise, and 
blurts out, &quot;Ikimasu! [let&#39;s go]&quot; 

Tomoyo: &quot;Sakura! It&#39;s broad day light!&quot; 

Sakura: &quot;Hoe~oh well, sooner or later...Tomoyo, hanasa nai de [please don&#39;t leave me/ 
don&#39;t let go].&quot; 

Tomoyo laughs: &quot;I never have,&quot; then she draws closer to Sakura&#39;s side, whispers, &quot;and I 
never will.&quot;
