<h1>Love Reflected</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Tomoyo&#146;s soft hands reached out, holding Sakura&#146;s face firmly as she 
stared longingly into the young woman&#146;s eyes. Sakura, smiling warmly 
as she gazed back into Tomoyo&#146;s eyes, held the dark haired girl&#146;s gaze 
waiting for Tomoyo to make the next move.

The garden of the small temple was beautiful, with a small pond 
(complete with manmade waterfall which filled the little garden with 
the gentle chiming sound of falling water) in the background, and the 
two had the garden all to themselves.

&#147;Your so beautiful.&#148; Tomoyo whispered, their gazes locked as they 
gazed into the deep pools of each other&#146;s eyes. Finally, Tomoyo 
released her hold and slid forward, her hands reaching down to grasp 
Sakura&#146;s pajama top as she eased it slowly over Sakura&#146;s body. As her 
breasts were exposed, Tomoyo leaned forward and grasped them, suckling 
on one while she slowly pinched and played with the other. A soft gasp 
escapes from Sakura&#146;s lips as she holds Tomoyo&#146;s head to her chest 
with one hand, while her other hand works on freeing Tomoyo&#146;s bosom 
from her own pajama top. Tomoyo closes her eyes as she feels the top 
loosening, and Sakura&#146;s probing fingers find her breasts beneath the 
soft cloth. Tomoyo suddenly rises and presses her body close to 
Sakura&#146;s, rubbing their breasts together as she kisses Sakura again, 
filling the brown haired girl&#146;s mouth with her exploring tongue.

Their hands roam freely, tugging away at each other&#146;s bottoms until 
they were completely naked. Free of their last bit of clothes, both 
girls slide onto the ground, swinging their legs about until they were 
in a trib stance, each of their pussies close to the other&#146;s in a 
scissors position

Reaching out, they each grab the other&#146;s arms so they could stare into 
the other&#146;s face as they made love. As they watched, the two slowly 
but surely begins to grind her hips into the other, sending waves of 
pleasure into her partner. Slowly the pleasure grows, like waves 
lapping on a shore, but as they increase their tempo the waves grow 
and grow and they begin to cry out and moan in response. Sakura, arms 
shaking and hands trembling, hold tightly onto Tomoyo as they piston 
their hips together harder and harder, tears flowing down her face as 
she is smothered in their joint bliss. Tomoyo, her own pleasure 
slashing through her in waves, smiles between rasps and screams as she 
humps harder to reach her nirvana with Sakura.

Suddenly, around them, balls of glowing light like large snowflakes 
fall around them, each touching and caressing each girl&#146;s body sending 
shivers of new pleasure through them. Sakura&#146;s muscles tense up, and 
so does Tomoyo&#146;s, as their moment races towards them. Thrashing and 
bucking wildly, both girl look one last time into each other&#146;s eyes 
(their happiness showing admist their pleasures) until they can no 
longer hold their grips, and fall backwards (hands slipping free from 
each other&#146;s grip) as they scream in release, the impact of the fall 
backwards barely registering as their brains shudder in the grips of 
the ignition of release between them. Their love juices splash out all 
over their hips and legs, sending strange new sensations as they rub 
against each other, feeling the sloshy wetness of their juices 
exciting them as they did.

For long seconds both girls whimpered, working off the last of the 
pleasure from their joint coming, until they were spent and content, 
lying on the ground gasping for breath. Briefly, Sakura looked to one 
side, waiting for the energy to pull herself up to embrace Tomoyo--- 
that&#146;s when she saw it.

A little female, no bigger than a foot tall, laid on the ground in the 
same position as her, looking back. She was naked, and looked as 
content as Sakura. The girl looked familiar--- opposite her, in the 
same trib position as Tomoyo, was a fairy, it&#146;s wings flat against the 
ground, her breath slow as she laid there sweaty and as exhausted as 
Tomoyo. As Sakura felt Tomoyo raise herself towards Sakura to lie on 
top of her, the fairy followed suit and raised herself towards the 
other girl.

&#147;Tomo-chan--- she&#146;s beautiful---&#148;

She reached out, grabbed Tomoyo, and drew her close to hold her 
beloved in her arms---

------

&#147;Who&#146;s beautiful?&#148;

Sakura&#146;s eyes go wide as she wakes, quickly pushing back as she was 
about to draw &#147;Tomoyo&#148; into her arms. &#147;ACK!!&#148;

&#147;Hey!&#148; Nina growls, her body hitting the floor with a thump as she 
lands (on her side) on the ground. Unceremoniously she stands up, 
brushing off the &#147;dust&#148; (and indignity) as she glares at Sakura, &#147;Well 
that&#146;s a fine &#147;how-do-you-do&#148;! First I thought you were going to hug 
me, then you freak and toss me off the bed like I was some sort of 
monster!&#148;

Sakura blushed, hugging her large feather pillow close to her (wishing 
it was Tomoyo in her arms) &#147;But you surprised me!&#148;

&#147;I just came in here to tell you to come eat breakfast!&#148; (Nina huffs 
her breath in annoyance) &#147;Anyway, how can you say that to such a 
beautiful and lovely creature like myself anyway? (You should be so 
lucky to grow up to be as beautiful as I am!)&#147;

&#147;How old are you?&#147;

Nina frowns visibly as she spins for the door, &#147;It&#146;s no time for you 
to do the &#147;Snoozer&#148; on me! You&#146;ve slept in too late, even for a 
Saturday! (and the schools here aren&#145;t nearly as murderously scheduled 
like in the waking world)---&#148; (stops) &#147;What did you mean earlier 
though?&#148;

&#147;I was tired!&#148; (sighs) &#147;Tomoyo and I made love all night.&#148;

&#147;Not what I meant! And for your info I had a &#147;full&#148; night with Eliza 
too but you don&#146;t see me all wussy wussy do you?&#148;

&#147;You didn&#146;t say that thirty minutes ago when---&#148;

&#147;CAN IT FUZZBALL!!&#148; Nina yells, spinning around on a present Kerberos. 
&#147;I DON&#146;T REMEMBER GIVING YOU ACCESS TO MY BEDROOM, YOU FLYING 
RODENT!!&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t think I wasn&#146;t scarred for life? I saw Eliza naked you---&#148;

&#147;THAT&#146;S IT!!&#148; (Nina grabs Kerberos by the throat and starts throttling 
him, it takes Sakura a minute to get the two separated and sent to 
opposite sides of the house before she goes for breakfast).

-----

&#147;Those two are like little children!.&#148; Sakura grumbles as she looks 
down at her plate.

&#147;Maybe we should have made them our kids instead of Mirra-chan.&#148; 
Tomoyo jokes, sitting down to eat breakfast next to Sakura, &#147;But this 
dream--- we made love in a temple garden?&#148;

&#147;It was at night, and the mood was so romantic and beautiful, with the 
falling water and the soft moonlight setting the mood.&#148; (smiles) 
&#147;Maybe we will make love in a garden soon?&#148;

&#147;Maybe sooner than you think.&#148; Tomoyo remarked, smiling at the 
thought, &#147;But what did you say when Nina woke you up? She&#146;s beautiful? 
Who&#146;s beautiful?&#148;

Sakura seriously ponders the question for a minute, munching on her 
food occasionally as she did, all the while Tomoyo watching her from 
her chair waiting patiently for the answer.

Sakura shrugs, scratches her head and blanks out. &#147;I can&#146;t remember.&#148;

&#147;Oh Sakura-chan---&#148; Tomoyo sighs, going back to her food, &#147;You just 
dreamed it.&#148;

&#147;And those visions are mucho important so stop forgetting them.&#148; Nina 
walks in with Kerberos in tow (but at least not clenched in her fist 
in a death grip) &#147;Since your our so called &#147;savior&#148; it&#146;d be nice if 
you could remember these visions. They&#146;re probably precog in nature 
you know.&#148;

&#147;Precog?&#148;

&#147;Short for Precognitive. It means to see visions of events that have 
yet to happen. You&#146;ve had that happen before, remember?&#148;

Sakura ponders it for a second, &#147;I remember. Happened with Fly but---&#148;

&#147;But nothing! These visions might unlock important things about why 
the cards went back to being Clow cards (let alone how they escaped). 
So please keep this by your bed---&#148; (slides a recorder across the 
table towards Sakura) &#147;It&#146;ll help you remember.&#148;

&#147;Remember? A tape recorder?&#148;

&#147;When you have a vision and wake up? Quickly start dictating it into 
the recorder before you forget. It&#146;ll save us all a lot of time 
playing 501 questions to get the info you should be able to remember 
without all the gizmos and gadgets.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m trying!&#148;

&#147;Try harder.&#148; Nina sighs, walking back out the door quickly before 
Tomoyo has a chance to scold her. Tomoyo, frowning slightly at Nina&#146;s 
scolding of Sakura, gives her a warm smile in Sakura&#146;s direction to 
calm her frayed nerves. &#147;You&#146;ll remember those dreams. Don&#146;t worry. 
And besides I&#146;d love to hear any intimate dreams you have.&#148;

&#147;Ok.&#148; (Sakura swallows hard, palling slightly, before she stands up) 
&#147;It&#146;s my turn to cook tonight, right? Who&#146;s eating?&#148;

&#147;Mom&#146;s working late and Windy&#146;s bringing takeout to her. Everyone else 
is going to be out (and Mirra-chan&#146;s spending the weekend at Hikaru&#146;s) 
so it&#146;s us, Kero, Nina &amp; Eliza (and they eat together downstairs 
anyway) so it&#146;s a quiet dinner for two (plus three diners 
downstairs).&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m going to make Okonomiyaki tonight.&#148;

&#147;MAKE MINE MODERN---&#148;

&#147;Modern-yaki. I remember, Kero.&#148; Sakura smirks, hearing the voice 
coming from outside. &#147;It&#146;s the one put on top of soba, right?&#148;

&#147;YAH!! MODERN-YAKI!!&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; Nina (outside) suddenly said. &#147;What&#146;s that?&#148;

&#147;WHAT KIND OF JAPANESE GIRL ARE YOU?&#148;

&#147;ONE WHO LIVED IN HAWAII MOST OF HER LIFE!! DON&#146;T GET SASSY WITH---&#148;

&#147;YOU&#146;RE A LOSER!! LOSER!! CAN&#146;T EVEN FIGURE OUT WHAT---&#148;

&#147;DON&#146;T MAKE ME KILL YOU!!&#148; (sound of running feet fading in the 
distance)

&#147;I better get going---&#148; Sakura turns to leave, only to feel two 
familiar hands touch her face and turn her gaze, her eyes locking to 
Tomoyo&#146;s. &#147;Your so beautiful.&#148;

Sakura shuddered, suddenly remembering part of her dream. Eyes glazed 
she moved forward, kissing Tomoyo, her hands pushing Tomoyo&#146;s arms 
down. &#147;Sakura?&#148;

&#147;Take my nighty off. Make love to me--- in our garden.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; Tomoyo looks about, realizing Sakura was remembering her 
dream. &#147;Sakura? Snap out of it! Sakura?&#148; (Sakura&#146;s hands reach to undo 
Tomoyo&#146;s nighty buttons (but she wasn&#146;t wearing her nighty so no 
buttons to undo)) &#147;Sakura! Sakura!!&#148;

Sakura&#146;s eyes shoot open as she realizes what she was doing. With a 
muffled yelp she runs out the door. &#147;Sakura wait!&#148; (door slams shut 
behind her) &#147;---Sakura---&#148;

Quickly Sakura runs back into the bedroom, shutting the door hard 
behind her, jumping onto the bed and covering her head with her 
pillow, sobbing as she did. &#147;OH GOD!! OH GOD!! TOMO-CHAN!! OH GOD!!&#148; 
Sakura wailed, hiding her head beneath her pillow. She tried to take 
advantage of Tomoyo in the kitchen! She felt so badly---

&#147;Oh sweet Sakura.&#148; Tomoyo softly whispers, touching a hand to Sakura&#146;s 
shoulders.

&#147;NO!! I&#146;M SORRY!! I&#146;M SORRY!!&#148;

&#147;Please don&#146;t say that.&#148; Tomoyo whispers again, pulling Sakura up from 
under her pillow to gaze into her eyes, &#147;I think your dream is 
beautiful.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan---&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan.&#148;

Gently, softly, the two draw together and kiss again, Sakura slumping 
into Tomoyo&#146;s arms as the kiss breaks allowing the dark haired young 
woman to cradle Sakura gently in her arms. &#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be.&#148;

Eventually Sakura rises to her feet again, goes downstairs and heads 
out shopping with her blades on, hearing the roar and hum of the city 
about her as she went about her business. Eventually. But for now the 
only sound Sakura can hear is the soft beating of Tomoyo&#146;s heart as 
she cradles Sakura&#146;s head close to her heart. Briefly Tomoyo remembers 
back to the incident with Shadow/Fear. She remembers as Sakura laid 
shivering in her arms, locked in the grips of Fear and seeing her 
worst fears, Tomoyo dying before her eyes, before her. Tomoyo pulled 
her top open, revealing her body and pressing Sakura&#146;s head close to 
her heart soothing Sakura&#146;s fear with the sound of her beating living 
heart, to assure the young woman that she was still quite alive. 
Tomoyo sighs, running a hand across her chest as she thinks back. 
&#147;Sakura-chan---&#148;

Tomoyo briefly remembers her own fear.

Sakura in the arms of another, in love with him and separated from 
her.

If she was alone, she knew she would have been dragged under from the 
fear.

But as long as Sakura was in her arms, close to her heart, she feared 
nothing.

As long as Sakura was there, she could be strong, and nothing could 
stop her.

As long as---

Tomoyo shakes her negative thoughts. With a quick movement she makes 
the bed again, picks herself up from her short moment of self doubt, 
and goes downstairs to her Studio to do some work.

-----

Shopping was quicker than Sakura thought.

She got everything she needed, and then some. It was a short list but 
she still managed to do the entire list in record time (not many 
people were at the shopping center today). As she roller bladed back 
home she spotted a holo banner set up on several light poles (far 
cleaner than stapling messages onto the poles). The banner was an 
advertisement for a Cultural Festival at the Lunaris&#146; Shrine.

&#147;I love festivals---&#148; (blinks) &#147;---but I never heard of the Lunaris&#146; 
Shrine before.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a Fairy Shrine.&#148; Sakura turns towards the voice, confused. 
Keiko, the source of the voice, motions towards the banner as she 
steps up next to the younger woman. &#147;Every season the Fairy religious 
shrines has a cultural festival to meet and greet those who don&#146;t 
follow their faith. Sorta like a &#147;getting to know your neighbors&#148; 
festival, and it introduces people to the Fairy faith.&#148;

&#147;What is the Fairy&#146;s religious faith?&#148;

&#147;Lunaris&#146;. It&#146;s a worship of nature and the creator without naming 
names for the Creator, as well as none of the the heavy duty rules and 
regulations of most major religions. It&#146;s popular amongst certain 
species like halflings and Amazonians, also it&#146;s a religion of choice 
for alternate relationships because the Lunaris&#146; faith believes in 
love without boundaries.&#148;

&#147;Are you---&#148;

&#147;Actually no, and it&#146;s kind of confusing---&#148; Keiko admits, blushing 
abit, &#147;Eve&#146;s a devote Lunarian, but I&#146;m Shinto (a throwback from my 
days as a Ronin). She keeps trying to get me into her religion, but I 
sorta like my religion even if it&#146;s a little rusty at times.&#148; (smirks) 
&#147;Though I have no personal qualms about practicing some of the sexier 
parts of Eve&#146;s scrumptious religion. Yummm&#133;.&#148; (eyes glaze over as 
Keiko falls deep into her own thoughts).

&#147;Keiko? Keiko?&#148;

&#147;Huh? OH!&#148; (snaps out of it) &#147;It&#146;s fun and there&#146;s lots of booth for 
games and food and lots of discussions on both the Fairy &amp; other 
religions in town so you and Tomoyo should go check it out. It&#146;s 
tomorrow night so don&#146;t miss it. Here---&#148; (hands off a data pad from 
her pocket to Sakura) &#147;---tell it where your starting off and ask for 
directions to the nearest Lunaris&#146; Shrine and it&#146;ll give you 
directions straight from your front door to the shrine. Can&#146;t miss 
it.&#148;

&#147;Thanks---&#148; (Sakura pockets the device and looks about, heading home) 
&#147;---I&#146;ll go with Tomoyo, see the festival, sounds like fun---&#148; (stops) 
&#147;---I&#146;ll check on Mirra-chan and see if she wants to go too.&#148;

Sakura spins about and head in the opposite direction. 

-----

The house Umi lived in was enormous, as big as Tomoyo&#146;s home.

&#147;Pheeww!!&#148; Sakura faintly whispered in admiration, looking at the huge 
house. &#147;Are they here? Maybe they went to the mall or somewhere---&#148;

&#147;Excuse me?&#148;

A gentle yet strong voice catches Sakura&#146;s attention, &#147;Oh, hi. I&#146;m 
looking for Hikaru---&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s me.&#148; the young red haired girl announced, motioning towards 
herself. &#147;I&#146;m Hikaru.&#148;

&#147;I meant the Hikaru that lives at this house---&#148;

&#147;My niece? She went shopping with her friend Mirra. Want to come 
inside and wait for them?&#148;

&#147;No--- no---&#148; (Sakura blushes abit realizing she was meddling in 
Mirra-chan&#146;s personal affairs by following her to Umi&#146;s house). 
&#147;That&#146;s alright, I better---&#148;

&#147;Want to come with me to the mall? I&#146;ll buy us lunch.&#148;

&#147;I guess---&#148; Sakura lamented, allowing the bolder red haired girl to 
take her by the hand and roll her on her blades off towards the mall.

-----

At a rather nice diner in the mall the two sat and ate lunch while 
chatting.

After Hikaru asked a question about Sakura&#146;s family, she returned the 
&#147;favor&#148;.

&#147;Where&#146;s your family?&#148; Sakura asked.

&#147;I don&#146;t remember.&#148; (smiles fades slightly from Hikaru&#146;s face) &#147;---I 
remember everything up to the point I--- well, when I---&#148;

&#147;Died?&#148;

Hikaru&#146;s face blanked abit, then she smiled again. &#147;That&#146;s right. Umi 
told me about you. The news is always buzzing about a &#147;Card Captor&#148; 
saving the Realm from Clow disasters.&#148; (blushes) &#147;Is that you?&#148;

&#147;Yeah---&#148; (blushes back) &#147;---I guess.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s great!&#148; (Hikaru&#146;s enthusiasm level suddenly shoots up seven 
notches) &#147;I never met a real savior before! You must be real tough to 
beat!!&#148;

&#147;Yeah---&#148; Sakura shyly replies, suddenly remembering her previous 
question, &#147;Is it lonely? Without--- I mean---&#148; Hikaru smiles, reaching 
out to take Sakura&#146;s hand. Her grip was strong, and her eyes held a 
fierce burning fire that comforted Sakura as she stared into them, 
feeling less awkward than a moment ago. &#147;I have Umi, Fuu, little 
Sakura, and my beloved. They&#146;re my family now---&#148; (looks a little sad, 
the tips of her mouth drooping slightly) &#147;I miss my brothers, I miss 
Hikari, but &#147;life&#148;, as it is, goes on.&#148;

&#147;Who&#146;s Hikari?&#148;

&#147;My dog. Here---&#148; (pulls out a small memory book and flips through the 
pages) &#147;---here&#146;s a few pictures of him. He&#146;s the best dog ever!&#148;

&#147;He&#146;s beautiful.&#148; Sakura remarked, feeling a little sad for the red 
haired girl&#146;s loss, &#147;You have any plans tonight?&#148;

&#147;Not really. My special someone&#146;s out of town on a business trip, and 
I got the apartment to myself tonight so maybe I&#146;ll eat in and---&#148;

&#147;Do you--- I mean do you want to eat with us? I&#146;m making dinner 
tonight! It&#146;s okonomi-yaki!&#148; (gulps) &#147;I even have soba, too!&#148;

&#147;Are you sure? It&#146;s OK for me to---&#148; (Sakura nods her head up and down 
silently, blushing) &#147;Thanks! I&#146;d love to share dinner with you! Can I 
do something? Bring drinks, dessert, an appetizer or something 
stronger or---&#148;

Sakura smiles, feeling the weight lift from her shoulders abit, &#145;She&#146;s 
so energetic.&#148;

------

On the way home the two talk about house guests.

&#147;The first minute Mokona was through the door into Umi&#146;s house and she 
tried to beat him over the head with a vacuum cleaner the maid was 
using!&#148; (laughs) &#147;I swear! She was taking huge swings at him, running 
back and forth trying to throttle poor Mokona with this vacuum cleaner 
that was still on! It was so embarrassing to say the least! Finally 
she managed to catch Mokona on the end of the vacuum but by then I 
grabbed the vacuum and we&#145;re having this awkward tug of war over the 
vacuum with Mokona attached to one end like an oversized dust bunny 
freaking out as we struggled for the vacuum! I felt sorry for him!&#147;

&#147;I haven&#146;t done anything like that yet with our house guests, but I 
once took Nina&#146;s favorite dessert from the freezer and ate it!&#148;

&#147;So that&#146;s what happened to it.&#148;

Sakura freezes, her momentum already rolling her right smack into Nina 
as she stands near the front gate of the estate watching Sakura 
arrive. &#147;---Nina---&#148;

&#147;Uh-huh.&#148;

Sakura face faults as she stares at the green haired girl&#146;s leering 
face, sweat dropping as she does.

&#147;So is that dinner in your hand or are you just embarrassed to eat and 
run into me?&#148;

-----

While they were cooking dinner in the downstairs kitchen, they began 
talking (Sakura first).

&#147;You surprised me!&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s the second time you accused me of that today, it&#146;s becoming a 
bad habit for you.&#148; Nina remarked, chopping up one of the ingredients 
carefully, &#147;Like this?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, that&#146;s great. Keep going like that.&#148;

&#147;Alright.&#148; (looks at Sakura, then at Hikaru) &#147;So is that who I think 
it is?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know, who do you think I am?&#148; Hikaru remarks gleefully.

&#147;Never mind---&#148; (Nina sighs relenting her question as hopeless), 
&#147;---anything else?&#148;

&#147;Did you know there&#146;s a festival?&#148;

&#147;The Cultural Festival at the Lunaris&#146; temple in town? Yeah, I heard 
of it Sakura, it happens every season. The nearest Lunaris temple back 
where I used to hang on the Big Island was on the high road between 
Kona &amp; Waimea (Kamuela). Out of the way place, you had to know where 
to go to find it. The menehune frequent Lunaris&#146; temples often (being 
little folk like the fairies) so it&#145;s not uncommon to go to a Lunaris&#146; 
Cultural Festival in Hawaii and meet the legendary little people of 
the islands while at the shrine.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s a &#147;menehune&#148;?&#148;

Nina looks at Sakura with a slightly askewed expression, &#147;Ask Tomoyo.&#148;

Hikaru smiled at Nina&#145;s comment, &#147;Little Hikaru invited Mirra to go 
with her, so they&#146;re going.&#148;

&#147;And I&#146;m going to take Tomoyo with me.&#148;

&#147;You two are going?&#148; Nina asks.

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m taking Eliza with me then and going also.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;Eliza&#146;s Lunarian, that&#146;s why.&#148; (Nina huffs her breath in a short 
burst of annoyance) &#147;You&#146;re not the only one whose intrigued by their 
sexy rituals and stuff. I&#146;d like to see more of it too.&#148;

Sakura blanks out, not knowing what &#147;rituals&#148; Nina (or Keiko earlier) 
were talking about.

&#145;I guess I&#146;ll find out later.&#146; Sakura thought to herself.

&#147;Can I join you four too?&#148;

&#147;YES!!&#148; Sakura chirped up, feeling Hikaru&#146;s endless enthusiasm rubbing 
off on her again. Suddenly the phone rings, &#147;I&#146;ll get it.&#148;

&#147;So why are you going?&#148; Nina asks Hikaru, &#147;It sounds interesting. Why 
are you going?&#148;

Silence.

&#147;Your concerned for their safety and want to watch out for them.Your 
such a nice friend.&#148;

(If Nina&#146;s teeth grinded any harder, her eyes narrowed any further, 
and/or her muscles clenched any harder, her head would probably ignite 
from the pressure building within) &#147;Whatever.&#148;

&#147;That was Mirra-chan!&#148; (Sakura was returning, causing Nina to quickly 
chill her temper and go back to minding her chopping) &#147;She and Hikaru 
will meet us there.&#148;

&#147;Will wonders never cease.&#148; Nina remarks blandly, &#147;Where&#146;s the 
Lunaris&#146; Shrine we&#146;re going to anyway? It&#146;s usually hidden very well 
within a city and I admit to having skipped on going with Eliza when 
she went to worship on weekends.&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s see---&#148; (Sakura inputs the info and waits for instructions) 
&#147;---here it is. Located on top of the Cherry Hill site. Hmmm--- it&#146;s 
the site of the temple from Sailor Moon.&#148;

Nina stops chopping and freezes in place, eyes closed as she grits her 
teeth.

&#147;Isn&#146;t that near where Rena lives? She used to be your friend, right?&#148;

&#147;Used to---&#148; Nina sighs, her hand going back to chopping. 
&#147;---everything with me pretty much ends like that.&#148;

&#147;Like what?&#148;

&#147;Used to, Sakura. Everything about me eventually ends with &#147;used to&#148;.&#148;

&#147;Not if I can help it.&#148; Eliza whispers, entering the kitchen and 
kissing Nina softly on a cheek.

&#147;Well there you are. You going to help me or what, because this is a 
complicated recipe!&#148;

&#147;Sure. Where do I start?&#148;

As the two start working together, Sakura notes how each one 
occasionally exchanges smiles, or soft touches to each other&#146;s hands 
as they work, quietly exchanging secret emotions and feelings between 
each other as they did.

Kero of course was primarily focused on dinner so he didn&#146;t notice one 
bit.

------

&#147;Ready for bed yet, Tomo-chan?&#148; Sakura called out as she entered the 
bedroom, feeling the soft touch of her pajamas against her skin as she 
closed the door behind her. &#147;Sorry if I woke you.&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t go to sleep yet. Come to bed.&#148;

&#147;Alright, coming.&#148; Sakura whispered, slipping off her house slippers 
and walking up to the bed, &#147;I love the way the night light is shining 
through the bedroom windows. It&#146;s beautiful when it&#146;s this soft kind 
of bright---&#148; (Sakura&#146;s voice sticks as she pulls the sheets aside) 
&#147;---tomo-chan?&#148;

Tomoyo, naked and lying with legs spread and a welcoming smile, 
motions for Sakura. &#147;Maybe we could make a garden of our own here--- 
in our special place?&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan---&#148; Sakura whispers headily, feeling Tomoyo lean forward to 
help her undress, &#147;Goddess your too good to me.&#148;

&#147;Your very special to me, Sakura-chan. Very special.&#148;

As she pulls the last of Sakura&#146;s garments off she pushes Sakura back 
abit, swinging her legs about to position herself the way Sakura 
described them making love in the dream. &#147;Scissors position?&#148;

&#147;Yes. I remember--- gasp!&#148; Sakura shuddered as both woman&#146;s g-spots 
touched and rubbed together, sending sparks of sensual energy through 
each of them. &#147;Hold me---&#148;

&#147;Sakura---&#148; Tomoyo rasps, grabbing Sakura&#146;s arms and holding her 
tight, so each could stare into the other&#146;s arms as their hips slowly 
but surely began to stroke and mesh together. Sakura, holding tightly, 
sheds a tear as she works her hips towards their heavenly moment, 
feeling the tremendous waves of pleasure growing and growing with each 
stroke and bounce. &#147;Tomo-chan! Goddess--- tomo-chan!&#148;

&#147;Sakura--- feels so good--- Sak---&#148; a strong cry breaks Tomoyo&#146;s 
concentration, whipping her head back as she works harder, bouncing 
her hips faster causing their intimate spots to grind together harder, 
their pearls stroking together again and again igniting fiercer sparks 
of pleasure as they worked hard towards their peak. Sakura suddenly 
leans back, breath staggered as her moment peaked. &#147;TOMO-CHAN! PLEASE! 
I CAN&#146;T---&#148;

&#147;SAKURA-CH---EYYAAHH!!&#148;

&#147;----&#148; Sakura&#146;s head drops back as she&#146;s overwhelmed, both women 
orgasming at once together. As their moments ignite, both women&#146;s hips 
fiercely pound together hard, their love juices splashing over each 
other as they come hard. The last of their energy fading, their grips 
fail and both fall backwards onto the soft bed rasping, their hips 
continuing to jerk spasmodically draining the last sparks of pleasure 
as they slowly came back down from their orgasm high.

Briefly Tomoyo&#146;s eyes fluttered, as she felt Sakura shift beneath her, 
drawing a smile from Tomoyo as she closed her eyes and imagined the 
pure blissful expression on Sakura&#146;s face.

As she opened her eyes again, her heart stopped. She briefly flashed a 
memory of a man&#146;s face before her, and it chilled her heart. 
Immediately though Sakura&#146;s loving face appeared, and she smiled again 
quickly (to cover her shock) and hugged Sakura hard.

Hours later, while Sakura slumbered, Tomoyo would question why she 
would think of his face while in the arms of her beloved Sakura. 
Why---? But no answers availed themselves. With a discouraged grunt 
she pushed the question back into the far depths of her mind once 
again and rolled over to fall back asleep. At first she couldn&#146;t 
sleep, feeling abit depressed about what happened, only to have her 
moody face vanish when she felt a sleepy Sakura roll over towards her, 
unconsciously wrapping her free arm about Tomoyo and holding her 
close. With a contented sigh, Tomoyo gently pushed Sakura onto her 
back and laid down on her breasts, relishing the gentle &#147;pillows&#148; 
beneath her head as she fell into a contented sleep.

-----

The next night, the Cultural Festival at the Lunaris&#146; Shrine.

It was everything Keiko promised and more.

Food booths, games, and informative booths on the different religions 
based in the dream scape version of Tokyo including several Earther 
religions (Christianity, Judasim, Shinto, Creator-ism (born on various 
Earth Colonies during the 22nd Century as an alternative to &#147;Earther&#147; 
religions)), as well as the religions of Chi&#146;haito (Nekochanian) (the 
religion of power, knowledge &amp; wisdom gained through the guidance of 
one&#145;s ancestors and the creator), Leri&#146;biarti (Winterian) (a religion 
promoting self enlightenment through love without boundaries (similar 
to the Lunaris&#145; religion)), and the Nanotechnian religion which, 
though not having a &#147;name&#148; to call itself, is focused on praising and 
praying to &#147;Mother&#148; (the Nanotechnian home world&#146;s omni-sentient 
planetary computer &#147;spirit&#148;).

&#147;Mother&#148;, it is said, can reach out to her &#147;children&#148; even across 
great distances in space and dimension. Though, at times, &#147;Mother&#147; is 
not the right term to describe the benevolent spirit living within the 
Nanotech&#145;s homeworld. Sometimes, when she finds a lonely soul dying 
for love, she &#147;adopts&#147; them as her lovers (making her to some &#147;Wife&#147; &amp; 
&#147;Beloved&#147; more than &#147;Mother&#147;). (As for the religion, and the 
differences between the order of &#147;Mother&#148; and &#147;Wife/Beloved&#148;, it&#146;s a 
far too complex religion to talk about in this fiction, so we won&#146;t 
mention it anymore past this point.)

All Sakura knew at that point was that she was having fun trying to 
retrieve a red &#147;yo-yo ball&#148; (a new novelty gift from NamoCatCat 
Corporation), yet frustrated when her string/hook broke for the third 
time. &#147;Aaahh---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;d like to try for those.&#148; A female voice suddenly spoke out from 
Sakura&#146;s side. &#147;You want that red one, right?&#148; Sakura nods her head as 
she turns to look, coming upon a strange sight of Michi Asagiri (who 
she met when buying Tomoyo&#146;s birthday gift) kneeling next to her. 
&#147;It&#146;s this one, right?&#147; Michi remarks, poking the red ball under the 
water a few times to point it out. &#147;Yes.&#147;

&#147;And that&#146;s the one Rahne wants---&#147; Michi pointed out, poking a 
crystal blue one under the water a few times watching it bob back up 
to the surface. Slowly the older woman stood up, shaking off the 
&#147;dust&#148; as she stared at the set-up of floating yo-yo balls in the 
water, reaching two hands out over the water and focusing on the two 
balls. &#147;Don&#146;t you need---&#148; Sakura started, only to stop as the two 
balls began to shake. With a quick jerk, both balls jumped out of the 
water and into Michi&#146;s outstretched hands, bringing a torrent of 
&#147;wows&#148; and &#147;ooohh&#148; from a crowd that gathered around them. &#147;Here you 
go.&#148;

&#147;Thank you---&#148; (blinks in disbelief) &#147;---but how?&#148;

&#147;Easy---&#148; Michi motioned for Sakura to follow her to where Rahne was 
waiting off to one side, the blue haired young woman eating something 
from one of the booths as she watched them approach. &#147;I have natural 
born powers, which is common in 10% of Winterians. Mine is to draw in, 
absorb, and redirect water in attacks or defensive moves. I simply 
gave the two yo-yo balls a good dunking before I stood up, making sure 
to get a complete coating of water around the balls. Then I simply 
focused on drawing the water from around the balls to me, yanking the 
balls up with the water and voila!&#148; (hands ball off to Rahne) &#147;Instant 
intimate festival gift. Here you go, Rahne.&#148;

&#147;Thank you.&#148; (Rahne leans forward and kisses Michi on the lips)

&#147;Aren&#146;t they cute, Sakura?&#148; Tomoyo sighs, Sakura noticing she&#146;s been 
filming them the whole time. &#147;Please, no press.&#148; Michi sighs, nudging 
Rahne aside to avoid the camera&#146;s roving eye. &#147;I&#146;m not comfortable 
being on film even for my nice parlor tricks like that water gimmick.&#148;

Somebody taps Sakura on the back. &#147;Sakura.&#148;

&#147;Chiharu! Yamazaki!&#148; Sakura chirps out, her good mood shining as she 
sees her friends.

&#147;Yama the Liar, huh?&#148; Michi groused, falling silent as Rahne nudges 
her gently.

&#147;So you came too, huh?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, we heard about the festival from Naoko! (She said she phoned 
you and Tomoyo last night but you weren&#146;t there).&#148;

Sakura blushed. They were too busy making love to answer the phone. 
&#147;Oh dear.&#148;

&#147;Naoko likes shrines and temples, doesn&#146;t she?&#148; Tomoyo quickly jumped 
in, saving Sakura from explaining their actions last night. &#147;She loves 
scary stories too.&#148;

&#147;Have you seen Naoko and the others? Are they here?&#148;

&#147;Naoko &amp; Rika have piano lessons.&#148;

&#147;I see. Too bad.&#148;

&#147;I already promised them I&#146;d make it up for them next weekend.&#148; Nina 
remarked, walking up behind the gang as she did.

&#147;How?&#148;

-----

Flashforward to next week (Holochamber 00 beneath the Daidouji 
Estates)

Somebody taps Sakura on the back. &#147;Sakura.&#148;

&#147;Naoko! Rika!&#148; Sakura chirped out, her good mood shining as she saw 
her friends.

&#147;So this is a holochamber, huh?&#148; Rika remarked looking about, &#147;I heard 
of these but this is the first time I saw one.&#148;

&#147;Tomorrow let&#146;s do the Hamtaro Musical and Lord of the Rings viewing 
set-ups. Those are fun. (Especially LotR!)&#148; Nina remarks, walking up 
behind the gang as she did.

&#147;You really like shrines and temples, don&#146;t you? Tomoyo quickly jumps 
in, before Nina brings up the Snoozer thing again. &#147;I love scary 
stories and this shrines the best for them!&#148;

&#147;R-r-really?&#148;

&#147;Did you hear the one about the---&#148;

&#147;Oh no.&#148; Sakura whimpered.

------

Back to the present.

A new crowd has formed, this time around a shooting gallery.

Rena Daisuki, two Globlek pulse pistols (set and locked in practice 
mode) in each hand, was busily raking up points as she blasted away 
holo-target after holo-target. &#147;Hey RENA!!&#148; Sakura calls out, bringing 
the 13th Judgment&#146;s attention towards her. With a slight sigh, Rena 
puts the guns down and motions for Trinity. &#147;Alright, pack this up and 
send it home please.&#148;

&#147;Right.&#148; (with a tap to her earrings she sets music blasting hard as 
she begins to weave a spell, teleporting the entire stack of prizes 
away). &#147;Did you get all of those yourself?&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148; Rena sighed, feeling her muscles slowly relax again after her 
grueling effort. &#147;Trinny likes these festivals for the rituals 
reserved for Lunarians (and the games you can only play if your magic 
capable), but I like them for the shooting gallery and all the prizes. 
Anyway I have to restock the crane game I keep in the downstairs 
vending machine room of my apartments. (I got it from a vending 
machine maker who I saved from a pack of wolves, and the credits I get 
from the machine every day helps pay the rent on the apartment).&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; Sakura blinks, uncertain how she got such a complex answer to a 
simple question.

&#147;Did you know about shooting galleries?&#148;

&#147;Eh?&#148; Rena turns, looking Yamazaki dead in the eye, only to watch 
Chihiro push him towards the shooting gallery booth. &#147;How such a 
lovable kid like Chihiro fell in love with such a chronic liar like 
Yama the Liar is beyond me.&#148; (sighs) &#147;He&#146;ll make a great politician 
one day--- or a stockbroker--- or even Prime Minister or something 
with a lot of power in it. One of those things.&#148;

&#147;Yama the Liar as the head of Nippon. We&#146;ll have to say our prayers if 
THAT happens!&#148; Michi spits out, looking at him with a skeptical 
glance. &#147;Guy scares the heck out of me whenever I see him.&#148;

Tomoyo draws near to Sakura, nudging her as she motions towards the 
yo-yo ball. &#147;Wasn&#146;t it nice of Michi to get that yo-yo ball for you?&#148;

&#147;Yes it---&#148; (?) (Rena rushes up to Sakura, eyes glaring) &#147;You can&#146;t 
kiss up to Asagiri! What a scheming little jerk!&#148;

&#147;W-what?!&#148;

&#147;Everyone knows she has friends of her family in the Winterian 
Council! That&#146;s a lot of good PR for you if she jumps on your 
bandwagon and sings your praises!&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know what your---&#148; (face faults) &#147;---I didn&#146;t do anything!&#148;

&#147;You seem to have a genuine dislike of being at a disadvantage, don&#146;t 
you?&#148; Tomoyo points out.

&#147;So what? It&#146;s natural! But you---&#148; (glares at Sakura)

&#147;Wait! It&#146;s not like that---&#148; (Sakura begins to back up) &#147;---Michi 
just gave me this because---&#148;

&#147;Why don&#146;t you leave her be, cranky-pants.&#148; Michi suddenly comments, 
pushing herself between the two, &#147;You got a problem with who I&#146;m 
friends with?&#148;

&#147;You damn well know I have a problem with that, &#147;friend&#148;! Considering 
we have a past longer than you&#146;ve known her you got some nerve playing 
favorites at this late stage of the game!&#148;

&#147;Late stage?&#148; Michi remarks as if injured by the comment, &#147;Rei my 
dear, the &#147;game&#148; is not only not late, it&#146;s still &#147;afoot&#148; as it were.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t patronize me!&#148; Rena hisses, &#147;You know what I me---&#148;

&#147;What do you WANT with my little sister?!?&#148;

&#147;---dammit, kick over a rock and it has to crawl out.&#148; (Rena spins on 
Toya) &#147;What the hell do---&#148;

&#147;YOU DID IT!! YEAH!!&#148;

&#147;?Huh? That can&#146;t be---&#148; (everyone stops to look, but Rena is the only 
one who can bring herself to say the obvious) &#147;---well, I guess he can 
do something other than lie through his teeth.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s the solution!&#148; Nina cheerfully remarks, pointing up at a huge 
rabbit toy (with fairy wings) being given by the shooting gallery as 
top prize. &#147;You and Toya should win that. I bet Sakura&#146;d want that!&#148;

&#147;You love bunnies, right?&#148; Tomoyo asks.

&#147;Well--- umm--- not as much as I love you---&#148; (blinks at everyone&#146;s 
expectant faces) &#147;---but yes?&#148;

&#147;I want that!&#148; Trinity points, &#147;But they won&#146;t let me play! Guns 
only!&#148;

&#147;FINE! I&#146;M ON IT!!&#148;

&#147;HEY WAIT!! DAMN HER!!&#148; Toya chases after her, both grabbing two guns 
each and firing away like mad-people at the targets (putting an 
overall fear of god into the gallery owner as he watches).

&#147;Uh-boy.&#148; Keiko remarks, walking up behind the gang, &#147;Good going, 
Nina. Now this&#146;ll take this side of forever to resolve AND somebody&#145;s 
probably going to get killed over it.&#148;

&#147;Tomoyo---&#148; Sakura pulls at her arm, &#147;Follow me.&#148;

&#147;Wh---&#148; (stops to think) &#147;---oh. Ok. But what about---&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ll keep an eye on it. Make sure Toya or Rena doesn&#146;t kill anyone 
by accident. So go on.&#148;

&#147;B-but Nina---&#148;

Both Toya/Rena glare at each other as they slap fresh power clips into 
the guns, both seeing nothing but red. &#147;Trust me. They&#146;re not going 
anywhere for awhile.&#148;

With that, Sakura reaches out and grabs Tomoyo&#146;s hand, drawing her 
through the crowds towards the shrine&#146;s main building. &#147;Where are we 
going?&#148;

&#147;I noticed something when we were walking about---&#148; Sakura notes, 
pulling Tomoyo through a side path and into a beautiful garden hidden 
out of sight within a courtyard of the main building. Within the 
garden, to one side, a beautiful water set-up complete with a 
recycling waterfall (filling the air with the soft chiming sound of 
falling water) reminds Sakura of her dream. But something new that 
Sakura didn&#146;t notice before, was a path leading deeper into the 
shrine&#146;s garden (and a more secluded spot).

&#147;Too bad we didn&#146;t wear our pajamas.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s OK, Sakura. I think we can repeat the dream without our 
pjs---&#148; (looks up) &#147;---what the?&#148;

The sky is filled with glowing balls of light suddenly, snowing down 
softly around them. &#147;Just like in my dream---&#148; Sakura notes, feeling 
the small spheres of light pass her, brushing a hand through the 
energy as they fall about her. &#147;They&#146;re warm and fuzzy to the touch. 
It&#146;s good energy they&#146;re filled with.&#148;

&#147;I feel it too. They make me feel at peace. So soft and cozy just 
touching them.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s beautiful, Tomoyo---&#148; (Sakura snaps to) &#147;---there must be a Clow 
card here. But---&#148;

&#147;But what?&#148;

&#147;What if the card is with someone? What if it&#146;s--- I can&#146;t do it if--- 
it wouldn&#146;t be right.&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan.&#148; (Tomoyo looks up and gazes longingly at the balls of 
white light falling about them) &#147;They are beautiful, aren&#146;t they?&#148;

&#147;Yes---&#148; (stops, blushing slightly) &#147;---but not as beautiful as you, 
Tomo-chan.&#148;

&#147;I feel the same way. Sakura-chan.&#148;

Slowly Tomoyo reaches out with her hands, holding Sakura&#146;s head as 
they lock their gazes and stare long into each other&#146;s eyes. Suddenly 
a noise takes them off guard as someone bursts into the garden, waving 
something large and fluffy and pink in their hands. &#147;WE GOT IT!!&#148;

It takes a few awkward seconds before someone, Keiko mainly, speaks 
up.

&#147;The booth keeper couldn&#146;t take the stress of the plasma flying like 
crazy, and the two of them blasting through his booth with a 
vengeance, so he gave them both a prize just to get rid of them.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; Sakura whispers, looking at the two bunnies awkwardly. Rena 
quickly spins about and hands her bunny off to Trinity. &#147;This OK?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s beautiful! Thank you---&#148; (smooch) &#147;---you&#146;re the sweetest!&#148;

&#147;---well---&#148; (for the first time in Sakura&#146;s life, she sees Rena blush 
from ear to ear, shuffling her feet at the compliment) &#147;---thanks---&#148; 
(this of course confuses Sakura)

Seconds later the second bunny is shoved into view. &#147;Want it? I&#146;ll 
take it if you don&#146;t want it.&#148;

&#147;Thanks, Toya.&#148; Sakura meekly responds, taking the bunny and holding 
it tight.

&#145;I guess he&#146;s sweet once in a blue moon--- still, Mirra-chan&#146;s too 
good for the likes of him.&#146; Sakura&#146;s thoughts suddenly wander back to 
Tomoyo, who stands near her dutifully smiling and filming her with the 
bunny in her arms. &#145;Still, I wish we could have been alone for a 
little bit longer, just the two of us.&#146;

&#147;What are you going to call her, Sakura?&#148;

Sakura hugs the rabbit close, blushing abit as she gazes at Tomoyo, 
&#147;Tomo-chan.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a beautiful name, Sakura.&#148; (&#145;I&#146;m jealous!&#146; Tomoyo playfully 
whispers under her breath)

Sakura smiled, &#145;Don&#146;t be.&#146; she whispered back, remembering Tomoyo&#146;s 
assurance to her last night.

&#147;So who&#146;s up for more food?&#148; (Nina) &#147;I barely got through the booths 
and I&#146;m still hungry!&#148;

As the group follows Nina, Tomoyo stops (Sakura wasn&#146;t following 
them). &#147;Sakura?&#148;

&#147;Come with me please.&#148;

Tomoyo smiles, grabs Sakura&#146;s hand as they head deeper into the hidden 
garden 

Nina leads the others off to find food, leaving Rena/Keiko staring 
back where Sakura/Tomoyo went off to. &#147;Think we should follow them?&#148;

Keiko shook her head, &#147;I didn&#146;t bring my peeping visor with me, and 
voyeurism isn&#146;t my thing.&#148;

&#147;Mine neither.&#148; (sighs) &#147;Let&#146;s go, I feel abit hungry my---&#148;

&#147;Good evening.&#148;

Rena growled under her breath as she spun about, coming face to face 
with---

&#147;Oh. It&#146;s YOU.&#148; Rena scoffed, looking her up and down as she did, &#147;Had 
a going out of business sale at Sailor Moon.com? Nice, in a Sailor 
Mars-temple look by the way.&#148;

&#147;Kaho---&#148;

&#147;Keiko, Rena. How is she?&#148;

&#147;Why don&#146;t you ask her yourself and stop spying on her in school.&#148; 
Keiko spat out, &#147;At least this time out your being abit less obvious 
about it, filling the role of math teacher in a room other than 
Sakura&#146;s avoiding directly being in her face in her class.&#148;

&#147;Still it&#146;s a drag.&#148; Rena chipped in, &#147;Using the school&#146;s security 
system and a Krallis Eye to see what Sakura is up to in school. I 
never imagined you for the voyuer type myself. But then again there&#146;s 
a first time for everything isn&#146;t there.&#148;

&#147;Your still not over it, are you Rena?&#148; she asked in a matter of fact 
way.

&#147;How the fuck should I get over it? My life turned upside down? 
Changing my name? Falling for a girl not even my species? You tell me, 
how the fuck should I get over that?&#148; (Rena storms over to the water 
effect and shoves her hands into it, splashing water on her slightly 
sweaty face) &#147;To you knowing what&#146;s going to come in the future is no 
big thing. For me it&#146;s a very big thing---&#148; (Rena walks away) 
&#147;---forget it. You haven&#146;t a clue what the hell I&#146;m trying to tell you 
anyway.&#148;

&#147;Is that so.&#148;

&#147;Probably more so than you know.&#148; Keiko remarks, watching Rena&#146;s 
retreating form as she departs back the way they came (not following 
Sakura or Tomoyo). &#147;What&#146;s with you anyway?&#148;

&#147;?&#148; (confused expression)

&#147;Never mind---&#148; (walks off following Rena out) &#147;---you really are 
clueless aren&#146;t you.&#148;

Seconds later Keiko returns and grabs Kaho as she does, &#147;And where are 
you supposed to be?&#148;

&#147;Central gathering area to give a lecture on Shinto practices?&#148;

&#147;Boy are YOU lost!&#148; (Keiko drags Kaho behind her as she walks back the 
way she came) &#147;Central gathering is on the other side of the shrine! 
You really can&#146;t find your way to save your life!&#148;

&#147;I guess.&#148;

&#147;You guess, what a stupid answer---&#148; (Keiko sweat drops) &#147;---you make 
my sense of direction look flawless by comparison.&#148;

&#147;Is it that bad?&#148;

&#147;Of course your sense of direction is bad!&#148;

&#147;I meant yours.&#148;

&#147;---I hate you---&#148;

------

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; Tomoyo whispered, her heart pounding as she followed 
Sakura deeper into the small hidden garden of the shrine. Around them, 
as they entered a deeper area, filled almost completely by a natural 
miniture waterfall coming out of a rock pillar rising up above the 
shrine&#146;s roof, Sakura could sense a card nearby. &#147;What&#146;s that?&#148; Tomoyo 
asked, pointing at the pillar.

&#147;It&#146;s an area reserved for water sprites.&#148;

&#147;How do you---&#148; (Sakura points at a nearby sign) &#147;---oh.&#148;

The sign reads &#147;WATER SPRITE WORSHIP AREA. DO NOT ENTER!&#148;

There were no water sprites to be found though.

&#147;Too bad we can&#146;t just seal the card&#146;s power and let the card be.&#148; 
Tomoyo laments.

A sharp cry catches Sakura&#146;s attention. As she turns she notices a 
faint glow from a small hidden area behind the waterfall. Carefully 
kneeling down she looks into the small nitche and beholds a strange 
sight. Inside was Glow, the clow card creature, lying on her back 
exhausted (and quite naked). On top of her, cuddled in her arms, was a 
female fairy. &#147;---glow---&#148; Sakura silently whispered, but not silently 
enough. With a startled yelp the fairy looks up to see Sakura, quickly 
shielding Glow with her body trembling in fear. Glow slowly looks up, 
then nods her head once as if understanding what had to be. Gently she 
pushed the fairy aside, rising up towards Sakura holding her arms out 
to her. The fairy, however, didn&#146;t want to lose Glow so fast and jumps 
in front of the Clow girl shielding her from Sakura.

Slowly, with lowered head, Sakura draws out the key.

&#147;Key of the star--- with powers burning bright---&#148; (a glint shines in 
Sakura&#146;s eye as an idea hits her suddenly) &#147;---reveal the staff, and 
shine your light. Release.&#148;

With the fairy holding Glow tight Sakura brings the staff close to 
them, and smiles. &#147;Clow Card, give me your power--- and be free. 
Release.&#148;

With a slight nudge, tendrils of energy course out of the wand and 
around Glow, removing her powers (and the glow energy about her) 
leaving her intact, but powerless. With her powers sealed, the Glow 
card is made and sent into Sakura&#146;s hand by a brief gust of wind. 
Fairy, smiling, holds Glow&#146;s limp tired form in her arms, kissing Glow 
over and over again. Briefly the former card smiles, and whispers it&#146;s 
thanks to it&#146;s former mistress before allowing the fairy to whisk her 
away.

As Sakura holds the card up to the light she is surprised to see a 
different image.

On the card is Glow, and her fairy lover, holding each other tightly. 
Below is written this---

&#147;Fairy Glow&#148;.

&#147;It&#146;s better this way---&#148; Sakura sighs, &#147;If I took her away from her 
love it would have been wrong. Even if I am her mistress it&#146;s not fair 
for me to destroy her happiness for my own needs. Tomoyo? I---&#148;

&#147;THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!!!&#148; Tomoyo yelled, camera (hidden in her purse the 
whole time) rolling away at the newest capture. &#147;This&#146;ll make a great 
episode for DVD No. 2!!&#148;

&#147;---oh---&#148;

&#147;So it&#146;s a new Clow card now?&#148; Tomoyo asks, looking at the new image. 
&#147;Yes. Without that dream I wouldn&#146;t have realized how happy Glow was 
free. I would have ruined two lives if I sealed the card without 
considering Glow&#146;s feelings, or that of her beloved.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t think they&#146;ll ever forget this kindness you showed them, 
Sakura-chan.&#148;

&#147;Really?&#148; (blushes) &#147;---that&#146;s nice--- but---&#148; (holds card/rabbit 
close to her) &#147;---I wanted her to be as happy as I am. If somebody 
split us apart--- I would be unhappy. I thought she deserved the same 
right to happiness that I have.&#148; (smiles) &#147;I have a wonderful time 
today.&#148;

&#147;Me too.&#148; Tomoyo smiles, feeling a warm rush as she relished in 
Sakura&#146;s happiness.

&#147;Thank you, Glow--- I mean Fairy Glow. Thank you.&#148;

Somehow, maybe it was the lighting, but the image on the card (the 
fairy and Glow) seemed to be smiling as they held each other close.

Somebody walked out of the path they came into the garden. &#147;---it&#146;s 
really beautiful! You have---&#148; Umi stopped and looked at 
Sakura/Tomoyo, &#147;Uh--- hi.&#148; (right behind her was Gaia, looking rather 
giggly at whatever mischief Umi was up to before running into Sakura). 
&#147;We&#146;ll be going now.&#148; Sakura announced, taking Tomoyo by the hand and 
leading her back the way they came. &#147;Wait, here!&#148; Umi suddenly passed 
two crystal ingots to Sakura. &#147;One for each of you. They&#146;re Fairy 
Charms. I personally am a believer in Sprite Charms but we got them 
just because we&#146;re members of this Shrine and it&#146;s a freebie at the 
gate.&#148;

&#147;Fairy Charms can grant wishes---&#148; Gaia said with a smirk.

&#147;So can Sprite Charms! Really---&#148; (Umi turns to look at Sakura again) 
&#147;---well, I hope the charms grant your&#146;s and Mistress Tomoyo&#146;s fondest 
wish.

&#147;My wish already has come true.&#148; Sakura whispers, looking into 
Tomoyo&#146;s eyes and squeezing her hand tight. &#147;But maybe one more 
wish---&#148; Tomoyo whispers, &#147;---one with wedding bells, and a beautiful 
bride to walk down the asile with me.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan---&#148;

As the two leave Sakura suddenly sweat drops. &#147;Can I be the bride?&#148;

&#147;Oh Sakura-chan---&#148;</pre>
