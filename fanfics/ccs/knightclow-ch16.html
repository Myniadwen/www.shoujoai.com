<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 16 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Sakura Kinomoto gently took the fine brush to the
piece of stone carving, the red-brown haired woman
carefully shifting the dust of ages aside. It was a
difficult task trying to reveal the intricate carvings
beneath while not damaging any of the fragile material
itself. Then the slightly dusty young woman delicately
set it down on the white cloth, moving away before
taking a camera and snapping off a few shots for their
records while being careful not to step on her white
lab coat.

Deep beneath the Tokyo Museum the restoration rooms
were almost Sakura&#39;s private domain, well, hers and
the rest of the specialty staff. As an archeologist
and historian Sakura often helped research the correct
context in which to place the new artifacts in as well
as lending a delicate hand in cleaning them up,
despite her own modesty about her skills.

&quot;Miss Kinomoto,&quot; the new assistant Yue Susanoo asked
curiously, his blue hair falling into his eyes, &quot;where
did you want this?&quot; In his hands he held up a circular
clapper, a type of ceremonial bell that Li had sent to
Sakura as part of her Clow exhibit.

&quot;Let me,&quot; Sakura took it then nearly dropped the
golden artifact as the power pulsed through her. It
was clearly a artifact of power, one that her senses
told her was connected to Clow Reed, though what it&#39;s
power might be eluded her.

&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; Yue asked softly, seeing
her stiffen in surprise.

Taking a deep breath Sakura shook off her surprise,
smiling at him weakly. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she reassure
him, &quot;just gathering wool for a moment.&quot; With
reverence she set it down on a work bench, &quot;I&#39;ll be
taking a closer look at it later.&quot;

&quot;Of course ma&#39;am,&quot; Yue nodded.

Sakura noted the time as she stretched out, smiling
tiredly. &quot;I think we need to pack it up for the day,&quot;
she said, &quot;we can always get back to it after the
weekend&#39;s over.&quot; She pulled her labcoat off, dusting
off her pants and shirt as she continued, &quot;Thank you
very much for your help in sorting out this latest
shipment, Yue.&quot;

&quot;It was my pleasure, ma&#39;am,&quot; Yue answered as he
followed Sakura outside and they locked up behind
them.

&quot;If you keep calling me ma&#39;am I&#39;m going to have to get
violent,&quot; Sakura said impishly, &quot;just call me Sakura,
please.&quot;

Yue hesitated then he nodded, &quot;Sorry Sakura.&quot; Bidding
her farewell he strode off, soon disappearing into the
twilight.

Sakura blinked in surprise as she saw a familiar
sportscar waiting at the bottom of the steps up to the
Roman designed museum. &quot;Tomoyo?&quot; she asked, smiling at
the dark haired reporter who was casually waiting,
leaning up against the side of her car.

&quot;Hello Sakura,&quot; Tomoyo pushed off from the side of the
car then she hesitated, fidgeting a bit. &quot;I was going
to call, but since I have to ask a favor I thought I&#39;d
do so in person,&quot; she said with a self-conscious sort
of amusement.

&quot;What kind of favor?&quot; Sakura asked, feeling faintly
amused to see the usually bold Tomoyo looking so
nervous.

&quot;Let me give you a ride home,&quot; Tomoyo opened the door
gracefully as she said, &quot;and I&#39;ll tell you all about
it.&quot;

&quot;Curiouser and curiouser,&quot; Sakura said as she climbed
in, Tomoyo taking the driver&#39;s seat and starting up
the purring engine. &quot;So what&#39;s going on?&quot; she asked.

Tomoyo kept her eyes on the road as she said
uncomfortably, &quot;I&#39;ve mentioned before that my mother
Sonomi and I are a bit... distant.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sakura nodded.

&quot;It&#39;s Sonomi&#39;s birthday this weekend,&quot; Tomoyo smiled
wryly, &quot;and I&#39;ve kind of been guilt tripped into
going. I was sort of hoping you&#39;d be willing to come
along as my guest.&quot;

&quot;Would I regret asking why?&quot; Sakura asked gently.

&quot;My mother and I tend to snip at each other
automatically,&quot; Tomoyo sighed, &quot;I&#39;m sort of hoping a
new guest will induce us to be on our best behavior.&quot;
A slight smile, &quot;And considering how close your mom
was to mine, it might be a nice gift for her to meet
you.&quot;

Sakura reached out to put her hand over Tomoyo&#39;s,
squeezing it softly. &quot;You really care about your mom,
don&#39;t you?&quot; she asked.

Tomoyo shrugged uncomfortably, &quot;I guess so, though we
sure have an odd way of showing it.&quot; She smiled at
Sakura as charmingly as possible, &quot;You haven&#39;t said
yes or no?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll go,&quot; Sakura laughed softly.

&quot;Thank god,&quot; Tomoyo chuckled. She pulled up to the
road in front of Sakura&#39;s house as she said, &quot;The
party starts at seven on Saturday, so I&#39;ll be here to
pick you up at six?&quot;

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Sakura frowned slightly as a thought
occurred to her then asked, &quot;how should I dress, by
the way?&quot;

&quot;These parties aren&#39;t too formal,&quot; Tomoyo reassured
her, &quot;you could try wearing that outfit I got you for
dinner, maybe?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Sakura smiled as she got out of the
car, Tomoyo standing beside her under the soft glow of
a streetlight. She smiled with amusement as she
confessed, &quot;I haven&#39;t been out on a Saturday night in
ages.&quot;

Tomoyo looked surprised, &quot;Seriously?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve kind of been busy with my career and before
that, university,&quot; Sakura explained.

Tomoyo got back into her car, starting up the engine
as she said cheerfully, &quot;Then you can just consider
this a date.&quot;

Sakura chuckled to herself softly, smiling as she
walked up to her house. &quot;A date, huh?&quot; she murmured,
wondering if Tomoyo had meant that literally.

Across the city the young man who called himself Yue
Susanoo entered his apartment and locked the door
behind him, puffing out a sigh. The illusion of
humanity faded and his wings reappeared, his eyes now
hawklike as he ran a hand through his hair and called,
&quot;I&#39;m home.&quot;

&quot;About time you got here,&quot; the redheaded young woman
bitched as she strode in, the slightly taller woman
dressed in a simple gown, &quot;I&#39;m starving.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Yue blinked in shock.

The redhead gave him a look, &quot;It&#39;s me, Keroberos.&quot;

&quot;Kero?&quot; Yue squeaked, blinking. He cleared his throat,
vaguely surprised at his own reaction then managed,
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just a bit of a surprise.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Kero pointed out reasonably, &quot;I&#39;ve got to
leave the apartment sometimes, and it looks a little
odd having two men living together.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Yue admitted.

&quot;So, we&#39;re going out or getting delivery again?&quot; Kero
asked eagerly.

Yue gave her a frown as he reminded her, &quot;We shouldn&#39;t
be using magically created money so much, it&#39;s
dishonest.&quot;

Kero scowled, &quot;Do we have a choice? Or is your new job
going to pay well enough to fund this apartment and
feed us, too?&quot;

&quot;No, not yet,&quot; Yue sighed. They ordered the food and
ate hungrily as they talked, &quot;Sakura finally unpacked
the bell, and I&#39;m certain she recognized it.&quot;

&quot;So she now has most of the major artifacts of Clow,&quot;
Kero softly mused, &quot;but is she wise enough to use
them?&quot;

&quot;That would be the question,&quot; Yue nodded. He looked
off in the distance, his expression oddly remote as he
said, &quot;The cards are starting to emerge... once she
captures the minor houses, the other elements will
appear.&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s when things will get really crazy,&quot; Kero
munched glumly. &quot;I&#39;d really like to just reveal
ourselves to Sakura...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Yue shook his head, &quot;we need to be sure if she&#39;s
worthy first. If we awaken the full powers of Clow in
her, it could be disastrous if she&#39;s not ready.&quot;

&quot;So we watch and wait,&quot; Kero summarized grimly.</pre>
