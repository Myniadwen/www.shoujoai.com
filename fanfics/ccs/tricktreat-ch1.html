<h1>Trick or Treat (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>In this story, Sakura and Tomoyo are 12. 

Authors Note: This story just came to me one night in June after reading 
a friends. I love Halloween, and Cardcaptor Sakura so the two kind of 
flowed together in my mind. (Thanks to my friend and fellow Fan-fiction 
author, Raven Sama for the Spider hating idea.) ^_^ 
 
 

It was another typical Thursday afternoon at the Kinomoto house. Sakura 
and Tomoyo were sitting on her bed doing homework, while Kero was 
sitting on the floor, playing and yelling at his favorite video game. It 
was October 29th. Only two days before one of their favorite times of 
the year. Sakura looked outside, the cool fall wind rustling through the 
brightly colored leaves in the tree outside her bedroom window. Sakura 
always loved Autumn, the cool breeze, the bright colors, and the way the 
fallen leaves seemed to dance in the wind. What she loved the most 
though, was the way that Tomoyo&#39;s hair flowed around her in the wind. It 
was almost as if she were some beautiful Angel sent to Earth to be with 
her. To watch over and protect her. She closed her eyes and pictured her 
Tomoyo, dressed beautifully in a long white dress while staring out over 
a small pond. A slight crimson blush crept up on her cheeks as she 
continued daydreaming. Tomoyo noticed and blushed herself at how cute 
Sakura looked. She shook her head to clear her thoughts and poked her 
friend in the ribs. 

&quot;Sakura?&quot; 

&quot;Ah! Tomoyo, you scared me!&quot; 

&quot;Sorry. What were you thinking about?&quot; 

&quot;Oh...um... it&#39;s nothing, really. Let&#39;s get back to work ok?&quot; Said 
Sakura as she picked up her pencil and started scribbling. 

They finished about an hour later and tried to decide on what to do for 
Halloween. 

&quot;We could have a party.&quot; Said Sakura. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know... we&#39;re still a little young for that. Aren&#39;t we?&quot; 

&quot;We could always stay home.&quot; 

&quot;No. It&#39;s Halloween. I want to do something special... with you.&quot; Said 
Sakura while holding Tomoyo&#39;s hand. 

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go Trick or Treating?&quot; Asked Kero. 

&quot;We&#39;re not little anymore, kids our age don&#39;t really go Trick or 
Treating.&quot; 

&quot;Sure they do!&quot; Said Tomoyo. &quot;You should have seen all of the older kids 
we had at our house last year! We even had a few teenagers! This will 
probably be the last time we can do this.&quot; 

&quot;Well I don&#39;t see why not.&quot; Said Sakura. 

Touya knocked on the door and said that dinner was ready. 

&quot;Ok. We&#39;ll be down in a few minutes.&quot; 

Her and Tomoyo put their books away and tidied up a little as Kero 
turned off the T.V. and yawned. 

&quot;Goodnight you two.&quot; He said tiredly. 

&quot;Goodnight Kero.&quot; Said Sakura. 

&quot;Have a good sleep Kero-chan.&quot; Said Tomoyo. 

&quot;Girls! Come and eat now or go without!&quot; Touya yelled from downstairs. 

&quot;Hai!&quot;  

Tomoyo and Sakura took their seats at the table while Fujitaka put the 
food on their plates and Touya poured their milk. 

&quot;So how was your afternoon girls?&quot; Asked Sakura&#39;s father. 

&quot;Great! Tomoyo and I decided that we&#39;re going to go out Trick or 
Treating one last time before we get too old.&quot; 

&quot;Thats nice. Are you going together?&quot; 

&quot;Hai.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m going to make the best costume for Sakura! It&#39;s going to be so 
Kawaii!&quot; Said Tomoyo. 

&quot;Don&#39;t forget Tomoyo-chan, you need one too.&quot; 

Tomoyo closed her eyes and put her hand on her chin as she thought about 
a costume that she could make for herself. 

&quot;Ok.&quot; 

&quot;Kaiju dosen&#39;t need a costume... she&#39;s scary enough as it is.&quot; Said 
Touya. 

&quot;I am not a monster! Quit calling me that!&quot; 

&quot;Now now you two, quit fighting.&quot; 

Sakura huffed and sat back in her chair angrily as Fujitaka took his 
seat. 

&quot;Let&#39;s eat shall we?&quot; He said. 

&quot;ITADAKIMASU!&quot; 

After dinner was finished, Sakura walked Tomoyo home so they could tell 
her mother about their plans for Saturday night. 

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s so great!&quot; Said Sonomi. &quot;I&#39;ll agree to it... but only under 
one condition.&quot; 

&quot;What is it?&quot; Asked Sakura. 

&quot;You have to come over here and Trick or Treat so I can get a picture of 
you two in costume!&quot; 

Sakura sweatdropped. 

Tomoyo gave Sakura a goodnight hug and kiss and said she would see her 
tomorrow. 

&quot;Goodnight Tomoyo-chan!&quot; Sakura said as she waved and walked down the 
driveway. 

Sakura sighed as she walked up the stairs towards her room. She opened 
the door to see Touya and Kero whispering to each other with big smirks 
on their faces. 

&quot;Hey! What are you two whispering about!?&quot;  

&quot;Gotta go!&quot; Said Touya as he ran out of her room and down the stairs to 
the kitchen to get himself a snack. 

&quot;Kero-chan!?&quot; She said annoyed. 

&quot;Sorry... can&#39;t tell you.&quot; 

Sakura sighed again as she sat down and started to get ready for bed. 
Her mind kept drifting back to Tomoyo&#39;s excited face when she agreed to 
let her make a costume for her. 

&quot;She really does love dressing me up doesn&#39;t she?&quot; Sakura thought to 
herself while smiling. 

She changed into her Pajama&#39;s, and climbed into bed wondering what kind 
of outfit Tomoyo had in store for her on Halloween. Her mind scanned 
through thousands of possibilities. Knowing Tomoyo, it would be 
something very frilly with lots of ribbons. Her mind shifted to thinking 
of what costume Tomoyo was going to make for herself. 

&quot;Whatever it is, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll look lovely in it.&quot; Sakura said 
yawning. She hugged herself through the covers and couldn&#39;t wait for 
tommorrow to come as she drifted off to sleep.</pre>
