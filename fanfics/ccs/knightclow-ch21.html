<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 21 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Yukito looked across the cafe&#39;s corner table at Tomoyo
as he asked, &quot;My god, how did the boss take it?&quot;

&quot;Just about as well as you&#39;d expect,&quot; Tomoyo said
while she drank from her cup of coffee, her black hair
flowing back from her face. &quot;And Sonomi wasn&#39;t too
happy either,&quot; she added glumly.

&quot;Huh,&quot; Yukito nodded, drinking too.

&quot;So, any tips on how to smooth this over with the
boss?&quot; Tomoyo asked the older photographer quietly.

Yukito shrugged slightly, &quot;Bring Kaho a scoop, that
always cheers her up.&quot;

Tomoyo snickered softly at that, &quot;Yeah, true. Problem
is I don&#39;t have any scoops on hand right now.&quot;

&quot;How about that historical research you were having
Rika do on the Knight?&quot; Yukito asked her as he had yet
another cookie.

&#39;That&#39;s what, his tenth? Where do they go?&#39; Tomoyo
thought with amusement. &quot;It&#39;s interesting,&quot; she
admitted as she munched on her own cookie, &quot;but most
of what I&#39;ve found is useful for background, not a
full story.&quot;

Yukito paused a moment, &quot;You have that &#39;I know
something you don&#39;t know&#39; look on your face. What&#39;s
up?&quot;

&quot;The Clow card, Water,&quot; Tomoyo smiled slightly grimly,
&quot;it chose to go with Mei-lin.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Yukito nodded, &quot;the competition is getting more
serious.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not competing...&quot; Tomoyo started, then trailed
off under Yukito&#39;s amused gaze. &quot;I guess so,&quot; she
conceded after a moment, &quot;and I find myself wondering
if Sakura even realizes she was two girls fighting
over her.&quot;

&quot;Have you officially asked her out?&quot; Yukito took
another cookie.

&quot;Well, no,&quot; Tomoyo admitted with a sigh, &quot;we have had
a dinner earlier, but it was back when we first met.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Yukito shrugged casually as he said, &quot;why not
take her out on a real date? Flowers at the door, a
nice dinner, some dancing... I think the Locket has a
good atmosphere and it&#39;s also pretty non-threatening.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not as easy as you make it sound,&quot; Tomoyo
blushed.

&quot;Hey,&quot; a tall, dark brown haired man walked up to the
table, dressed in a waiter&#39;s outfit. &quot;You going to
order anything other than snacks?&quot; he asked wryly.

&quot;Sorry Toya,&quot; Yukito smiled. &quot;Oh,&quot; he gestured towards
Tomoyo, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Tomoyo Daidouji,
Sakura&#39;s friend. Tomoyo, this is Sakura&#39;s big
brother.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Tomoyo blushed slightly, looking up at the older
man.

&quot;So you&#39;re the one,&quot; Toya gave her a thoughtful
glance. &quot;Sakura talks about you a lot,&quot; he noted with
a little smile.

&quot;Really?&quot; Tomoyo brightened.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Toya nodded. His expression became serious as
he added sternly, &quot;She likes you a lot, so if you hurt
her I&#39;ll be... annoyed.&quot;

Tomoyo gulped at the unveiled threat in the man&#39;s
eyes. Toya seemed kind, but there was steel beneath
his gentle surface.

&quot;Toya,&quot; Yukito elbowed him gently, &quot;stop scaring the
lady, please.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Tomoyo smiled at Yukito before
looking up at Toya. &quot;I will do everything I can to
avoid hurting your sister,&quot; she vowed.

&quot;Good,&quot; Toya nodded firmly before taking their orders
and leaving.

&quot;Don&#39;t mind Mr. Grumpy,&quot; Yukito said with some
amusement, &quot;after what happened to

their mother he tends to be a bit over protective.&quot;

&quot;I can understand that,&quot; Tomoyo gently agreed.

&quot;Do you think we could have seconds?&quot; Yukito asked
after he finished off his second order of cookies.

&quot;Oy,&quot; Tomoyo sighed.

Meanwhile, Sakura Kinomoto smiled to herself as the
brown haired woman delicately ran a cloth over a
rounded piece of clay, carefully removing the dust
from the inscription. &quot;All right,&quot; she moved back,
&quot;can I get a photo, please?&quot;

Yue Susanoo stepped up with the digital camera,
steadied it carefully then the blue haired

young man took the photo. &quot;Dr. Kinomoto,&quot; he asked
curiously, &quot;why the photos?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Sakura, not Doctor,&quot; she reminded him wryly,
wiping the dust off of her hands with a damp cloth.

&quot;Sakura then,&quot; Yue smiled.

&quot;Well,&quot; Sakura tucked the cloth into a pocket of her
lab coat as she explained, &quot;these artifacts are highly
fragile, so handling them must be kept to a minimum. A
digital photo can be studied at our leisure, and I can
even use my Mac to manipulate the image in various
ways to try to determine meaning.&quot;

Yue nodded, feeling just a bit foolish at not
considering the uses modern technology might have.
&#39;Then again, I haven&#39;t been active in this era too
long,&#39; he smiled. &quot;So, what&#39;s next on the list to
examine?&quot; he asked.

&quot;I&#39;d like to study the Sumeragi tablet,&quot; Sakura
stretched tiredly, &quot;but I think we&#39;d better stop for
today.&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Yue agreed as they carefully set the
artifacts on the work table before covering them with
a protective sheet.

The two headed out of the museum and Sakura blinked in
surprise as she saw the redhead who was sitting on the
steps. &quot;About time, Yue,&quot; the woman got up, &quot;I thought
I was going to starve waiting for you.&quot;

&quot;Kero,&quot; Yue sighed, &quot;you didn&#39;t have to wait, you
know.

&quot;I got bored,&quot; Kero shrugged.

&quot;Friend of yours?&quot; Sakura smiled as she gently teased
her assistant.

&quot;Caroline,&quot; Yue improvised quickly, &quot;but people
usually just call her Kero.&quot;

&quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; Kero smiled sweetly. After a
moment she turned to Yue, &quot;Hello, food please!&quot;

Yue sighed. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; he turned to Sakura, &quot;I&#39;d
better feed her before we have a riot on our hands.&quot;

&quot;Have fun,&quot; Sakura smiled as the two walked away.

&quot;I really wish you hadn&#39;t done that,&quot; Yue murmured as
they walked away.

Kero frowned, &quot;What? I just wanted to get a close look
at her.&quot;

&quot;Not that,&quot; Yue sighed, &quot;she&#39;s a curious young lady. I
don&#39;t even want to think of the assumptions she&#39;s
going to make about us.&quot;

Kero laughed softly, &quot;You&#39;re going to be teased?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m certain of it,&quot; Yue sighed glumly.

&quot;Could we worse,&quot; Kero said as they walked on.

&quot;How so?&quot; Yue gave her a wary look.

Kero smirked, &quot;I was going to kiss you hello, to
maintain our couple act.&quot;

&quot;Ack,&quot; Yue winced, &quot;I&#39;d never hear the end of THAT.&quot;
