<h1>My Angel (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yurifan.html">Yuri Fan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/myangel-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The first indication I got that I was not floating was when I looked 
up. I could see an angel holding me.

&#147;An angel is taking me to heaven&#133;how sweet.&#148; But then I realized that 
I was no longer floating upwards. Now I was moving west.

&#147;Dear Angel, why have we stopped our ascent?&#148; As the angel laughed a 
familiar laugh, my heart soared

&#147;Sakura-chan! You&#146;re my angel! I&#146;m so glad I can see you again! But 
where are we going?&#148; Sakura-chan just laughed again.

&#147;You&#146;ll see.&#148; Eventually we started to go closer to the ground, and 
Sakura took me to my house.

&#147;Sakura-chan, is this what the afterlife is like? You have to haunt 
your home, like a ghost?&#148; Sakura did not answer my question, but I was 
so glad to see her. As we landed, I wrapped my arms around her and 
hugged her tight. Her angel wings wrapped around my back and pulled me 
close.

&#147;Tomoyo, promise me something. Never do that again. OK?&#148; I broke the 
hug.

&#147;Never hug you again, Sakura-chan?&#148; Sakura shook her head.

&#147;No, never try to kill yourself again.&#148; I gasped.

&#147;I&#146;m not dead? But how&#133;&#148; 

&#147;I used the fly card to catch you.&#148; How silly I felt then. Not being 
able to guess something so easily.

&#147;But how did you come back to life?&#148; Sakura laughed again.

&#147;I didn&#146;t. I faked my death to fool the alternate dimension card. I 
knew he would not leave us in peace unless he thought I was 
dead&#133;please promise me you won&#146;t try to kill yourself again&#133;no matter 
what happens to me&#133;&#148; I felt tears run down my face.

&#147;I promise, Sakura-chan. I promise, I promise&#133;&#148; I held the cardcaptor 
in my arms as I cried and repeated the phrase over and over.

&#147;Shhhh&#133;don&#146;t cry, Tomoyo-chan, don&#146;t cry. I&#146;m here for you now&#133;&#148; I 
slowly stopped crying and walked into the house with her.

&#147;Mom, mom, look! Sakura-chan is here! She&#146;s alive!&#148; Mom ran into the 
foyer and gasped.

&#147;Miss Kinomoto, how did you&#133;you&#146;re alive!&#148; After calling everyone and 
hearing all of the excitement, Sakura took me into my room.

&#147;Tomoyo-chan, I&#146;m sorry I wasn&#146;t there for you. You tried to kill 
yourself because you needed me, much more than I could have imagined. 
From now on, I want to spend more time with you. You&#146;re a wonderful 
friend, Tomoyo-chan. And&#133;&#148; I cut her off as I hugged her close.

&#147;You don&#146;t have to sacrifice anything for me, Sakura-chan.&#148; Sakura 
hugged me back.

&#147;But Tomoyo-chan, it isn&#146;t a sacrifice. Nothing would make me happier 
than to spend more time with my best friend.&#148; I felt sadness for the 
fist time in hours.

Friend. That&#146;s all I&#146;ll ever be to her. A friend. 

&#147;I want to spend the entire day with you tomorrow, Tomoyo-chan. Just 
us. Would you like that?&#148; Part of my sadness drifted away. Even though 
I could never have Sakura as my love, I could have the honey haired 
all to myself tomorrow.

&#147;Kiss me, Sakura-chan.&#148; I hadn&#146;t meant for it to slip out.

&#147;What was that Tomoyo-chan?&#148; 

&#147;Nothing.&#148; As I lied to my Sakura-chan, I closed my eyes and escaped. 
I was no longer there. I was older, sitting down, planning a wedding. 
My wedding. My wedding to Sakura-chan&#133;it was minutes later that I was 
jolted away from my fantasy

&#147;What are you thinking about, Tomoyo-chan?&#148; Why did she have to make 
it so hard for me? 

&#147;Just&#133;the future and stuff.&#148; But Sakura did not let up.

&#147;You&#146;re crying. The future can&#146;t be that bad.&#148; Tomoyo nodded.

&#147;You&#146;re right, Sakura-chan. As long as you&#146;re with me, I can live 
through anything.&#148; I felt the tears roll down my cheeks again.

&#147;Everything except not having your love. Yes, that&#146;s right, I love 
you. Will you marry me?&#148; Half of my brain was screaming to say it, to 
get it out in the open. But the other half knew Sakura could never 
love me back. Should never love me back. What had I done to deserve 
the love of such a wonderful person. And if we did get together, I 
could not give her children, I could not protect her. But most of all, 
I could not make her happy. That&#146;s why I though Sayoran was perfect 
for her.

As I thought about Sayoran, the first part of my brain started to gain 
control again. &#147;She said she wasn&#146;t happy with Sayoran in her diary. 
She said something was missing. That &#147;something&#148; could be the right 
gender&#133;&#148; I shook the voice out of my mind. If Sakura found out and she 
did not like me back, we could not be friends anymore. I could never 
go on like that. I only lasted a few months without her before. And I 
would know it was my fault she was gone&#133;
But that thought struck me funny. &#147;Wait a minute, it was my fault last 
time as well. She jumped in front of the magical attack for me&#133;I never 
told her not to do that in the future.&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan, please don&#146;t jump in front of any more bullets for me. 
I&#146;m not worth it.&#148; Sakura&#146;s reaction caught me completely off guard.

&#147;How could you say that, Tomoyo-chan? I can&#146;t think of anybody in the 
whole world who is more worth jumping in front of that attack for than 
you. You have been so loyal to me, so kind and devoted. Whenever 
something bad ever happened to me, you&#146;ve always been there for me. 
You&#146;re a wonderful person Tomoyo-chan.&#148;

The first half of my brain had a field day on that one. &#147;See? There&#146;s 
hope there&#146;s hope there&#146;s hope there&#146;s hope&#133;&#148; I knew that there wasn&#146;t 
any though. She had complimented me like that before.

&#147;Tomoyo-chan, I have to go home now. I&#146;ll be counting the minutes 
until our day begins tomorrow. Goodbye.&#148; Goodbye. Goodbye. 

&#147;Goodbye, Sakura-chan. I&#146;m so glad you&#146;re alive.&#148; Sakura-chan smiled.

&#147;So am I. And I&#146;m glad I caught you too.&#148;

One type of pain had replaced another. I had forgotten how hard it was 
to talk to Sakura. 

Mom walked in with a sad expression on her face.

&#147;I overhead you two talk. She still doesn&#146;t have a clue about your 
feelings for her. I&#146;m so sorry. Just promise me something. Promise me 
you won&#146;t make my mistake. You almost did already.&#148; 

I shook my head. &#147;I can&#146;t tell her. I&#146;ll lose her.&#148;

&#147;I was right about killing yourself! Look, what if you killed yourself 
today? You wouldn&#146;t have seen her! Promise me you won&#146;t make my 
mistake! If you and Sakura can be in love then my and Nadeshiko&#146;s 
souls can be at peace&#133;&#148;

Mom could never see anything besides her own life. &#147;I am happy when 
she is happy. That is enough for me.&#148; Was that the truth? It certainly 
wasn&#146;t now. Was it ever? Had I just convinced myself of it in the 
first place to make myself feel better?

&#147;That&#146;s not true and you know it. Please just promise me that you will 
tell her before she gets married. Please?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; And with that, Mom left, tears in her eyes.

I slowly let my head rest on my pillow as I tried to go to sleep. I 
would have watched videos of Sakura, but Mom had taken them away two 
weeks after Sakura &#147;died&#148; due to the fact that I watched them 
constantly. 

As I drifted into slumber, my dreams drifted into wedding dress 
stores. And wedding cake bakeries. And wedding kisses&#133;
