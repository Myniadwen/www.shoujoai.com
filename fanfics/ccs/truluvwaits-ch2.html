<h1>True Love Waits (in itsy bitsy pieces) (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kanzaki.html">Ms. Kanzaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/truluvwaits-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>What are you doing here?

This place, where you&#39;re standing, is called a stage. And crowds gather 
around a stage -though there aren&acute;t many people except those who work 
here- , in case you didn&#39;t know. And despite your experience, you&#39;ll 
always be a bit of an agoraphobic.

Sigh. I must pick up the guitar. Guess I haven&#39;t gotten over the 
haunting of failure.

But she has actually nothing to reproach herself, for everything she has 
ever embarked on has been a total success. She&#39;s nonetheless than 
Tomoeda&#39;s own child prodigy, she&#39;d heard people say from time to time. 
And the four guys that play in her band absolutely respect and adore 
her.

In fact, one of them, an auburn long haired 19 year-old guy, named Yuto, 
looks on to her in a forelorn fashion. He probably fell in love with her 
ever since he heard her play the piano in an audition. Her voice and her 
many other talents just deepened the spell.

Tuning chords. Chords. Chord. One by one. The most elegant fingers he 
has ever seen on a woman work with expertise ease each and every knob to 
get the instrument right. And then come in the strums. Beautiful, simple 
notes. But definetely not Japanese in any possible musical genre.

A voice that spills in words that are not Japanese either also soars 
quickly through the performing room in the night club. Amazing. It&#39;s 
just rehearsal and Daidouji-san always manages to make it look like the 
main event.

- Yuto-san, aren&acute;t you going to finish connecting the rest of the 
speakers?

-Hai, Tsuwabuki-san. I was on my way, in fact...

But that&#39;s a downright lie. If he moved towards the speakers it was only 
to be closer to her.

The way she holds the guitar. A child she is, like cuddling to it...

(Little does he know that this child thinks of her activity as more like 
caressing every bit of a lover so that the drunken chants of promises 
and desires come out for her delight).

- Yuto-san! You should really get a load of what she&#39;s singing!

He stops pretending to work the connections to the main audio equipment. 
He sighs in relief, for he can now watch his beloved without having to 
disguise he&#39;s doing it.

... And true love waits...

She can recall perfectly that a few days ago that her darling, 
ever-energetic Sakura-chan was right under the door of the school, 
before she arrived... Thus, the oddity of the day ensued.

- Ohayo gozaimasu, Sakura-chan!

I didn&#39;t mean to sound so cheery, yet this effect of silly yet 
enveloping giddiness is now second nature to me.

She didn&#39;t answer inmediately. I then examined her a bit, and found her 
wearing headphones. That explains it.

That also gives me the perfect excuse to approach her, and gently touch 
her shoulder. The tiny yet guilty pleasures I have.

- Huh? Ah, Tomoyo-chan! Ohayo!

Right on her heels she turns to me. This overwhelming physical and 
spiritual being that&#39;s Kinomoto Sakura. She also removes the headphones, 
and presses &quot;stop&quot; on an old cassette walkman.

- It&#39;s unusual for Sakura-chan to bring any kind of gadget for listening 
music to, having Li-kun&#39;s car stereo for that.

My sweet one blushes. Gosh! How I love when she does that!

- Well... Syaoran&acute;s car does not have a tape player. And besides, I want 
to listen this song by myself.

Asking the right questions, you get the right answers. Boy! Did I EVER 
get a response like that!

She grasped my arm and pulled me away. Of course I wasn&#39;t going to put 
up any resistance, since I didn&#39;t in a long time enjoy this kind of 
brusque needy behavior of hers towards me. Besides, with her height and 
strength, it would&#39;ve been useless. And there, under the lonely stairs 
of the back of the main building, I discovered just how powerful 
sometimes the tiny earphones of a cassette player could be, asking 
nothing of a CD or mp3 player.

- You... you say that you found it while helping your brother pack for 
his home moving?

I heard also how Sakura-chan, when she finds something like this, can 
speak so passionate. As if there was no other tune in the world worthy 
of mention than this one.

I smiled later on because of this incident while on that same evening I 
sorted through my own attic and visited the neatly kept tapes, suits and 
designs that on other times I made for Sakura-chan. I sighed a while, 
felt as giddy as in her presence, like a child. And out of nowhere I 
started sorting out the notes of the song.

She suddenly stopped playing the guitar. The stares she was getting from 
her bandmates made her feel uncomfortable.

- Errr... Anything wrong?

He couldn&#39;t believe it. It was rare to see deliciously mature 
Daidouji-san insecure. Why would she, with her perfect voice and playing 
genius, stop?

- I know we only play non-English songs from time to time... If it&#39;s 
alright with you guys, I&#39;ll include this song in our repertoire for the 
next show.

They were all surprised. Rarely did their divinely praised vocalist ever 
suggest a melody. She always seemed at ease with whatever song they&#39;d 
come up with.

Before even the usual control freak of Tsuwabuki answered, Yuto glanced 
quickly at the rest of his bandmates and said:

- You think we&#39;d hold you back on this one? The song&#39;s absolutely 
gorgeous! And.... - he involuntarily lowered his voice- since you&#39;re 
leaving in a few weeks, I don&#39;t see what harm can come from a Radiohead 
song.

She smiled her best smile. Of course, the only ones that knew her plans 
were they, her brothers in music. She didn&#39;t want to hold the news from 
them, mainly to give them time to search for her replacement. They all 
nodded, and she waited for Yuto to finish hooking up the audio 
equipment.

... in haunted attics...

Butterflies fly lazily in memories confined.

It&#39;s always this way. Waiting. 

Waiting, waiting. Emotions gathering dust. 

Waiting for someone to sweep the ages old crust of earth off them. 
Waiting for her.

Waiting for the one who suggested she&#39;d perform this song. 

- Now, lets run an audio check before rehearsing... - she sighed. And 
again an ages worn locket was taken out by her hand, and she trusted to 
it her success, like every time she embarked on an activity.

parenthesis : Sakura &amp; Kerberos

- Sakura? Sakura??

There was no response.

- SAAAKUUURAAAAAAAA???!!!!!

- Hoe!! What&#39;s with the screaming, Kero-chan?

The floating creature with the world&#39;s most obvious Osaka accent was 
looking sternly into her eyes, waving one of his arms in the direction 
of the studying desk.

- Didn&#39;t you notice it?!

She got up as fast as she could and her usually skeptic expression at 
whatever the Seal Beast hollered wildly about changed rapidly into one 
of disbelief.

- What?! What did I-

The image spoke clearly for itself- the top drawer, and the Sakura Book. 
Both open wide.

I have to rub my eyes two times or more. And still this is too weird to 
believe in. For it&#39;s been a long time since the cards, aside from their 
morning greet, have shown a tendency to get out by themselves.

- Kero... Is- are- any cards missing?

- Kero?- His silence is making me nervous, but I try to stay as calm as 
possible. - Kero? Am I right in supposing a card is missing?

The only thing he does is nod his head. Once and again. Nod his head and 
speak in the most skeptic of voices.

- Sakura, I must know... Did you open the book by any chance? For any 
purpose? Sakura?

I have now engaged myself in this mimical response. I shake my head in 
refusal to his questions.

- Kero, please tell me... Is there anything wrong? Who could&#39;ve opened 
the book? Which cards disappeared?

Stepping closer to the drawer, I suddenly stop her. To calm her 
confusion, I say:

- Don&#39;t bother in examining the book... I already did, and found only 
missing the Dream card.

With her evergreen eyes rolling she couldn&#39;t have expressed more concern 
than she did in that second.

- Yume? Yume&#39;s missing?

I knew which card was Kero-chan talking about- the one Syaoran-kun 
captured inside Tokyo Tower.

- Errr, Kero... do you think she&#39;s still mad at me by accidently 
stepping on her back when I sealed her?

The Seal Beast&#39;s mad wing fluttering couldn&#39;t have also expressed more 
disbelief.

- Nice joke, Sakura. But this is serious... Yet...

I drew closer to listen in on what Kero started mumbling about. 

- Hmmmm...... Hmmmm. Hmmmm!!!!

- What, Kero-chan?

- If the Dream card moved by itself... as all points out... what 
could&#39;ve motivated it? Kami-sama! I can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t feel its 
aura as it moved up and flew away!

I can&#39;t believe it either. All these years merely giving the cards their 
morning salutation and nothing else has probably made my magical sixth 
sense sluggish. 

The dying sunlight bathes my face for the last time. My eyes are drawn 
to the sun instantly. I can imagine the comments this would draw out 
from Syaoran...

- You know... you actually look cute like that....

Of course, that would&#39;ve been after I tortured him into saying it 
because he&#39;d stared at my face, too silently, too long.

... And of course, I think of what another sweet phraser would say. 
Tomoyo-chan.

-  It&#39;s quite natural that green should follow gold. Sakura-chan and 
Nature as one in my humble point of view.

I find myself next wondering on the flock of butterflies chasing after 
the sun. 

- Yume... what- what&#39;s going on?

The butterflies in my stomach stir yet downward. I&#39;m not sure of 
anything right now.

Except that I&#39;d like to chase after them. I lean into the windowsill and 
watch them go by.

.... Don&#39;t leave...

----------

parenthesis 2 : Yuto &amp; His Dream Girl

- You&#39;re chasing after a dream. Don&#39;t you know that?

- Huh?

- Yuto-san,- began Tsuwabuki in a calm voice - it was a long time ago 
that I was in your place... Hell! Who wouldn&#39;t?! She&#39;s...

Daidouji Tomoyo was now finished in writing down for everyone the 
musical sheet for the song. She set back a lock of her long dark hair 
that came across her face while she was bent over the box doing the 
transcription.

- ... beautiful...

- Fukuy-kun, can you please take this to the nearest copier and get at 
least six sets?-. The mere pale long hand of hers seemed to glide 
effortless through the heavy air of this for now empty nightclub.

-... sublime...

She seemed to be in control, her mind probably set in planning the 
further details of the performance.

-... so mature...

Yuto was sincerely amazed. Tsuwabuki was describing his thoughts on 
Tomoyo just as if he had his mind between his hands to read.

- Ah... I could just go on and on, and still not quite reach the half of 
her pros, ol&#39; chum! But...

- What, Tsuwabuki-san?

Tsuwabuki opened slightly his mouth as if to speak, but held his tongue 
back when he heard a pair of footsteps hurriedly march towards the stage 
area.

Daidouji-san turned around as well. A sheet of anticipation covered her 
eyes.

---------

... And True Love Lives....

She&#39;s staring at me. Again.

And I stop my humming. Sakura smiles. About enough to bring me to 
silence and feel nervous waiting for her voice to fill the space I left.

- I see I created a monster. You really liked that song, Tomoyo-chan?

It may have been the afternoon breeze, but I had the notion that it was 
the warmth of her breath I felt against my cheek. Then again, she wasn&#39;t 
that close enough.

Imagination plays the brightest yet cruelest of pranks on one.

But, in fact, her face was &#150;if just- a few inches away from mine.

- The song is lovely. I heard about the band and some of their material 
before, but I never imagined they could possibly write down something so 
simple and pure.

-In fact.- I added looking directly into her gorgeous emerald eyes with 
occasional specks of gold every now and then &#150; I convinced the band to 
rehearse it for our next performance.

She smiled a pleasant smile. One I knew of result from what I said.

It also made me smile, yet as always mine was as I, discreet and 
unwilling to hint at my own exploding happiness.

- It&#146;s good to know something like this... amid a crisis like the one 
I&#146;m having..

- What was that you said, Sakura-chan?

With half of herself trying to mantain the focus of her gaze into my 
face, and the other preventing if a bit sloppily that her hands trembled 
from the concern that invaded her, Sakura elaborated in carefully chosen 
words the present problem. 

- ... And, it may have nothing to do with the incident, but I&#146;ve been 
having strange dreams, and even daydreams lately. Tomoyo-chan, do you 
think these things might be related?

I pondered, assisting myself with an arm folded in a way to bring my 
hand to my chin and hold the rim of my thoughts through that of my face. 
Memory serves one well every once in a while, and to mind came the time 
I had one of the most strongest daydreams I&#146;d ever had with my dear 
energetic girl...

- Tomoyo?

- Tomoyo! Tomoyo!! Tomoyo!!! Tomoyo!!!! Tomoyo!!!!!

I was frozen stiff, the camera held dead at my lower side. As I like to 
think sometimes, there she was, taunting me, calling me on, plain 
teasing me. Images of her cladded in the many costumes I&#146;ve designed 
encircled me and danced the dance of envelopement. 

- Tomoyo! Tomoyo!! Tomoyo!!! Tomoyo!!!! Tomoyo!!!!!

I, finally giving in to the spell, set my camera ready and ran after 
her, no matter how many of her they were. I ran after her, along with 
her voice was mine with a soft if ecstasic laughter...

I&#146;ve never told her of that daydream back when we were children, and 
firmly nod to myself a &#147;never will tell her&#148; as she pours out the 
details of what has been going on her mind these days.

- Have you told Li-kun about what&#146;s going on?

Her eyes withdrew a bit brusque from me and fixed themselves on the 
passing cars by the busy avenue. I should&#39;ve known the answer.

- No.

The question that followed was obviously a dumb(?) one. 

- Why not?

For the longest time she paused as to consider her next words, all 
because she feared sounding like mad to the ears of the usually logical 
yet closeted romantic that was her best friend. 

- I&#39;m afraid... Afraid he&#39;ll say he&#39;s been having the same visions...

These last syllables acoustically died out from her lips, a failed 
sentence from a fugacious image that refused to go away.

(he&#39;s running off... yesterday, he was just walking away...)

Kinomoto Sakura didn&#39;t hear the slight flutter of her friend&#39;s sleeves, 
and snapped back to her senses when Daidouji Tomoyo had finished moving 
to put both of her hands on her sad crouched shoulders.

- Sakura, please, look at me.

I had no choice but to do as she told me... I&#39;ve never heard her say my 
name without the endearing &#147;chan&#148; she employs regularly.

There, before me, was a girl imprisoned by nightmares she should not be 
having. Not at all!! If anyone in the world deserved to be spared from 
such things was my friend, my love. 

My Sakura-chan.

- Listen... if anyone in the world deserves to be spared from such 
things is you... I must say as well that I&#39;ve never met a couple that so 
were meant for each other like Li-kun and you.

And for a still uneasy Kinomoto Sakura she repeated in a harmonious 
tone, so similar to her singing voice:

- Li-kun AND you.

I saw suddenly the skies clearer. I could even line a small smile.

Her voice has this effect on me, you see.

I looked up to HER face. There was absolutely no way I could deny that 
glueing my eyes to hers was better than the skies themselves.

(... so serene... yet firm...)

For now, no image-conjured boyfriend nor anyone else runs off into the 
distance.

- You&#39;re right. I musn&#39;t let myself be deceived by the nightmares. He 
loves me, he has shown it a million times before. Arigato, Tomoyo-chan.

The alleviated brunette, perhaps overpowered by gratitude, takes a 
rather huge step forward and hugs the all-knowing dark-haired beauty. 
The latter returns a bit hesitant the embrace. She does this like one 
handling a treasure.

- Really... it was nothing, little one.
