<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 11 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Sakura Kinomoto raised her battle staff even as she
fought back a smile at the situation. Behind her
Yukito snapped away with his camera while Mei-lin
tried her best not to laugh. &quot;I may nnot be able to
publish these pics,&quot; Yukito chuckled as the blonde man
got a very good shot, &quot;but it&#39;ll sure make great
blackmail material.&quot;

&quot;Stop laughing,&quot; Tomoyo growled, &quot;and stop this crazy
thing!&quot;

Flower beamed, the graceful woman in a full gown
firmly holding the struggling Tomoyo in her arms as
she smoothly twirled them around, dancing across the
rooftop. Dozens of different types of flowers flowed
from the woman to flutter down around the city hall,
decoratig the normally severe looking building in
lovely colors.

&#39;And to think, this started out so simply,&#39; Sakura
thought.

When the first witnesses told about the odd events
around city hall Sakura had raced to the scene, soon
met by Tomoyo, Yukito and Mei-lin. Using the Fly to
reach the roof while the others took the elevator they
had confronted the cheerfully dancing Flower. Emerging
from the stairs Tomoyo had come face to face with
Flower who had casually taken Tomoyo by the hand and
began to dance.

&quot;Can you capture Flower with Tomoyo so near?&quot; Mei-lin
asked, her black hair fallinng down her back in a
ponytail.

&quot;Not sure,&quot; Sakura answered, &quot;but I have an idea.&quot;

Not letting herself thing about it too much Sakura
stepped forward, extending a hand towards Flower in an
obvious invitation. Flower laughed softly as she
gently released Tomoyo, the dark haired girl stagering
a bit as Flower took Sakura in her arms. The heady
scent of Flower washed over her as they danced, the
taller woman looking down at her tenderly, and it was
almost with regret that Sakura brought it to an end.

Tapping Flower akwardly with the staff that she still
carried Sakura cried, &quot;Flower Card! Return to the form
you were created to be! Flower!&quot;

With a smile as welcoming as ever Flower seemed to
waver, her form swirling into flowers that congregated
at the point of Sakura&#39;s staff. A shinig card of light
formed, blazing in the twuilight before falling into
her hands as a beautifully illustrated paper card.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Sakura slid the card aay into the
latest costume that Tomoyo had designed for her, a
black and silver number that almost looked like
something a prince might wear/

&quot;Just a bit dizzy,&quot; Tomoyo admitted sheepishly,
smiling gratefully as Sakura gently took her by the
arm to steady her.

The sound of sirens off in the distance made Yukito
quickly out his camera away. &quot;We&#39;d better get going,&quot;
he reminded them, &quot;or we&#39;ll end up trying to answer a
lot of complicated questions.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Sakura used Fly, white wings unfolding from
her back as she took the surprised Tomoyo into her
arms. With a single sweep of her wings they were gone
even as Yukito and Mei-lin raced for the stairs.

&quot;I&#39;m glad the rooftop door was unlockewd,&quot; Yukito
sighed as they ran down the stairs.

&quot;Yukito,&quot; Mei-lin asked thoughtfully, &quot;what kind of
relationship do Sakura and Tomoyo have?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re friends,&quot; Yukito answered.

&quot;And?&quot; Mei-lin raised an eyebrow.

&quot;And that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say,&quot; Yukito answered
firmly, &quot;Tomoyo&#39;s a friend of mine.&quot;

&quot;That tells me a lot right there,&quot; Mei-lin stopped him
on the ground floor, both of them taking a moment to
catch their breaths. Looking much more composed they
walked out of the lobby, nodding to the remaining
evening staff before slipping outside.

The car was parked not far away in the safety of an
alley, Sakura and Tomoyo waiting for them. &quot;What took
you so long?&quot; Tomoyo asked, having recovered her usual
poise.

&quot;Next time Sakura flies one of us down,&quot; Yukito griped
good-naturedly, &quot;and you get to run down four flights
of stairs.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry,&quot; Sakura said earnestly, &quot;but I can
only carry one at a time.&quot;

Mei-lin gave Yukito a frown before smiling at Sakura,
&quot;It&#39;s all right, Sakura.&quot;

&quot;Sorry to drag you out for this one, Yukito,&quot; Tomoyo
made a face, &quot;it looks like we&#39;re not going to be able
to do a story on this.&quot;

Yukito chuckled softly, &quot;Yeah, but these pics of you
dancing with Flower are almost worth it. You looked
adorable.&quot;

Mei-lin found herself smiling at the disgusted look on
the reporter&#39;s face. The four of them climbed into
Tomoyo&#39;s car and headed off, avoiding any of the
police forces. &quot;I wonder who&#39;s going to have to clean
up all the flowers?&quot; Sakura fretted.

&quot;Probably city workers,&quot; Tomoyo answered, shaking her
head. They had nearly had to swim outside the
building, the flowers had been so deep around the city
hall. She smiled slightly as she addressed the group,
&quot;Do you want to grab something to eat?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Yukito instantly answered and both Sakura and
Tomoyo laughed.

Mei-lin chuckled, having heard some of the stories
about Yukito&#39;s legendary appetite. &quot;Thank you for
inviting me along,&quot; she added.

&quot;Glad to have you,&quot; Sakura turned to smile at the
woman in the back seat. Facing front Sakura asked,
&quot;Has your boss calmed down now that a week has passed
after your latest scoop?&quot;

Tomoyo smiled wryly as she admitted, &quot;Kaho Mitsuki is
still annoyed that I didn&#39;t at least run it by her
before we went to press.&quot;

&quot;How did you slip tha by her, anyway?&quot; Mei-lin asked
curiously. &quot;Normally the chief is pretty on the ball.&quot;

&quot;The version she saw wasn&#39;t the final one,&quot; Tomoyo
admitted, &quot;though that wasn&#39;t intentional. I got full
confirmation on certain bits of vital information
right before our deadline, so I had to put it in at
the last moment.&quot;

Sakura looked over at Tomoyo gently, &quot;I hope that it
didn&#39;t make things too difficult between you and your
mother.&quot;

&#39;Oh ho,&#39; Mei-lin leaned forward, listening intently.
&#39;I was wondering why the Chief was calling up Sonomi
Daidouji so often,&#39; she thought.

&quot;Considering my mother and I don&#39;t talk much anyway,&quot;
Tomoyo said quietly, &quot;it&#39;s not too much of a loss.&quot;

&quot;Are we there yet?&quot; Yukito asked impishly.

Relieved to have an excuse to leave the serious
conversation Tomoyo smiled, &quot;We&#39;ll be there soon,
trust me.&quot;

&quot;Where are we going anyway?&quot; Mei-lin asked as they
turned a corner.

Sakura recognized the route and smiled slightly, &quot;The
Rose, I think.&quot; As Tomoyo nodded her agreement Sakura
cotinnued, &quot;We had dinner there once, the food is
lovely.&quot;

&quot;Toya and I have, too,&quot; Yukito agreed cheerfully.

&#39;Well isn&#39;t that interesting,&#39; Mei-lin fought back a
flash of annoyance at the idea of Sakura and Tomoyo
going out together. She was a bit surprised at the
feeling, honestly, considering that she barely knew
Sakura but still...

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Tomoyo pulled up in front of the
resturant, the four getting out to walk towards the
front doors.

&quot;Miss Tomoyo,&quot; Jim smiled brightly as the four of them
walked inside, &quot;and Yukito-chan! Good to see you all.&quot;

&quot;I take it they&#39;re regulars here?&quot; Mei-lin asked
Sakura softly as the greeter talked to the two people
cheerfully.

&quot;Certainly looks like it,&quot; Sakura agreed.

&quot;We&#39;ll find out a table in a moment,&quot; Jim said
cheerfully, turning to hit a conceled call button on
the front counter. A few moments a waitress arrived
and they talked together softly. Jim turned back to
them, &quot;How about table six, a window seat?&quot;

&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Yukito said, the delicious smells from
the kitchen already wafting over them.

Mei-lin took in her surroundings the way she was
trained to, eyes sweeping the room. A casual style
dominated, mostly single sex couples sitting at the
tables. The seats themselves looked intended for
romantic moments, cozily placed near to each other.
&#39;And Tomoyo took Sakura here to dinner?&#39; she mused, &quot;I
wonder if it was a date?&#39;

Sakura stepped forward to pull out a chair for Tomoyo,
&quot;Would you care to sit?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Tomoyo smiled up at her happily.

Feeling a moment of whimsy Mei-lin quickly pulled out
Yukito&#39;s chair, &quot;Here you go.&quot;

Yukito blinked at her then began to laugh as he sat
down. &quot;You&#39;re a doll,&quot; he waved limply, camping it up
a moment before they all shared a laugh.</pre>
