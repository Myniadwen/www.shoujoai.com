<h1>A Weekend in the Sky (part 1 of 2)</h1>

<pre>	Friday night, and it was snowing in Sapporo.  There wasn&#39;t a lot
of wind, but the snow fell in thick flakes that quickly built up into
drifts.  Daidouji Tomoko didn&#39;t envy the pedestrians that she passed as
she drove home to her apartment.

	She could have a chauffer like her mother, but she liked driving
around and the few times she needed to work on something while travelling
the car&#39;s AI could handle the work.  But tonight she drove, hoping that
the work would distract her from what would be waiting at the apartment
when she got home.  Or rather, what wouldn&#39;t be.

	It wasn&#39;t working.

	She made the right-hand turn into the apartment building&#39;s private
garage area, the door&#39;s systems recognizing her car and letting her in.  
After that she let the car park itself and took the lift up to her
apartment on the top floor.  It was more of a penthouse, as Sumire had
said, but she liked to think of it as an apartment.  She had no desire to
grow old in a cavernous vault like her mother was, no matter how nice the
vault may be.

	Entering her apartment, she stopped and listened to the silence.  
There was a note on the wall, but a quick glance showed that it wouldn&#39;t
say any more than the other notes had:  Tomoyo was very nice, but never
fully committed to the relationship, always seemed apart when they should
have been closer.  She crumpled the note in her hand, and then just let it
drop to the floor.
	


	Tomoyo jumped when the intercom signalled, playing the notes to a
classical symphony that she had forgotten the name of.  Overcome with the
thought that Sumire may have returned, she had to steady her voice before
she could tell the apartment to show the visitor.

	Li Sakura&#39;s face filled the screen.  Tomoyo&#39;s heart took off as
she saw her friend&#39;s face, so long only seen in flat photographs.  But
then she noticed that Sakura&#39;s eyes were red and teary, and that her
friend was sniffling.

	&quot;Open voice and video.&quot;

	&quot;Tomoyo!  Uh, Daidouji-san.  Um...&quot;

	Tomoyo smiled.  &quot;You can still call me Tomoyo, if I can call you
Sakura.&quot;

	Sakura gave her a tear-stained smile.  &quot;I... can I come in?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, yes, certainly.&quot;  She walked over to the console and pressed
the entrance button, connecting herself with one of the lobby bioroid
guards, Bertrand.  &quot;Hello, Bertrand.  I have an unexpected guest.  Could
you escort her up to my room?  She hasn&#39;t been here before.&quot;

	The guard nodded, his face in &#39;helpful&#39; mode.  &quot;Certainly, ma&#39;am.  
And may I say, both Ernest and myself are again greatful for the Christmas
gift.&quot;

	Tomoyo grinned.  &quot;No problem,&quot; and cut the link.  Bioroids were
technically property of the building, but most of them were just as much
people as herself, and she saw no reason not to treat them like people.



	She hadn&#39;t seen Sakura since just before college.  They&#39;d just
taken their finals, and had both done well enough to get into the college
they wanted.  So that night had been a big party, going from bar to bar
and then ending up at Tomoyo&#39;s house.

	Sakura had been teasing Tomoyo about how she had never been
kissed, and Tomoyo had replied that she didn&#39;t know how.

	Sakura had blinked at her for a moment, letting that sink in, and
then smiled.  &quot;It&#39;s easy!  Like this!&quot;  And then she kissed her.

	And Tomoyo had kissed back with all her heart.

	Sakura was drunk enough for this not to bother her, and they had
gone on to several interesting activities that Tomoyo had fantisized about
before they passed out from the alcohol and the exertion.

	Unfortunately, Tomoyo awoke with Sakura gone.  In several confused
conversations between her, Syaoran and Sakura, it was quickly established
that Sakura was completely freaked over what had happened, and so Tomoyo
switched her college to a different one.  There were a few tries at
rekindling the old friendship at the old level, but Sakura was
uncomfortable, and Tomoyo found it harder than ever to keep her distance.

	She had gone to Sakura&#39;s wedding, but left the reception early.



	Tomoyo was interrupted in her musing by the elevator arriving at
her floor, and found to her surprise that she had stepped out of the
apartment to wait for her friend.

	As the doors opened she was shocked at what she heard.

	&quot;Get away from me you thing!&quot;  Sakura&#39;s voice was shrill and
fearful as she ran out of the elevator towards Tomoyo, who caught the
woman in her arms.  Sakura burst out crying again.

	Tomoyo sighed, and breathed a &#39;sorry&#39; to Bertrand, who gave her a
sad look back and told the elevator to take him back down.  Helping Sakura
into her apartment, she made a mental note to give him a thank you gift.  
&quot;Sakura, why?&quot;

	&quot;They&#39;re all, they&#39;re all thieves.&quot;  Sakura said with a heaving
voice.  &quot;She took, she took Syaoran away from me.  She&#39;s just supposed to
sit there and be a Secretary, not to be a real person!&quot;  Her voice raised
into a wail, and Tomoyo hugged her old friend, trying to give her some
comfort.

	&quot;Look, you&#39;re soaked.  Did you run here through the snow?&quot;

	Sakura nodded.

	&quot;Here, get out of these sopping wet clothes and take a shower.  
I&#39;ll set out a robe for you, and make some hot chocolate.  Then we can
talk some more.&quot;

	Sakura sniffled, and nodded.  &quot;Okay.&quot;  She looked left and right,
confused.

	Tomoyo gave a slight giggled.  &quot;Oh, right.  This way.&quot;  She led
her friend through her bedroom, and into the bath.  &quot;Here we go.  You can
just drop your clothes into the laundroid.&quot;

	Sakura had just walked through her large bedroom quietly, but now
spoke.  &quot;Are you married?&quot;

	Tomoyo shook her head as she set the shower to a warm temperature.  
&quot;No.&quot;

	Sakura nodded, and Tomoyo left her to her shower.



	There&#39;s something comforting about making hot chocolate, Tomoyo
always thought.  Heating the milk, but making sure it didn&#39;t boil, mixing
the chocolate, and making sure it doesn&#39;t clump.  It wasn&#39;t a tea
ceremony, but it was enough of something to do that it allowed her to get
her thoughts in order.

	So, when Sakura shuffled out in one of Tomoyo&#39;s robes, Tomoyo gave
her a sunny smile and a mug, and brought her to her couch.  A moment, and
the fireplace started up, a roaring fire warming the room.

	&quot;Now, who is this?&quot;

	Sakura took a sip of her chocolate milk, and sighed.  &quot;Syaoran&#39;s
office bought a bunch of bioroid secretaries two years ago.  They can&#39;t
strike, they don&#39;t take nine months off to have children, and they can
legally be told to wear makeup.&quot;

	Tomoyo nodded.  Several companies were doing this, which had been
leading to a number of people losing their jobs.  The government was
implementing educational programs to get the ex-secretaries into new jobs,
in fact.

	&quot;Well, I think... no, I know that Syaoran is having an affair with
his.  She&#39;s stealing him away from me!&quot;

	&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

	Sakura nodded emphatically.  &quot;I found lipstick stains.&quot;

	&quot;Well, that could be something innocent?&quot;  Tomoyo said hopefully.

	&quot;On his underwear?&quot;

	&quot;oh&quot;

	Sakura took a long pull of the chocolate.
 
	&quot;What&#39;s Syaoran doing at a corporation?&quot;

	Sakura sighed, and drank again.  &quot;The magic&#39;s gone away.&quot;

	&quot;What?&quot;

	&quot;It started ten years ago.  Magic stopped working so well.  It&#39;s
always been fairly weak in America and Europe, but suddenly China, Hong
Kong and Japan started to fade as well.  Kero said he thought this had
happened before - that that was the reason that he&#39;d been asleep in the
book so long.&quot;  She sighed.  &quot;That was before he had to sleep again.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

	&quot;Without magic, we had to get normal jobs.  He works at a
corporation, I do some photography.  I started out modeling, but I&#39;m no
longer able to compete with the looks of bioroid&#39;s grown to look
glamorous.&quot;

	Tomoyo nodded.  Another strike against bioroids, from Sakura&#39;s
point of view.

	&quot;So we settled down to be normal, and things were fine for a
while.  But lately he&#39;s been growing away, coming home very late.  Not
wanting, you know, sex.&quot;

	Tomoyo blushed slightly.

	&quot;I didn&#39;t want to think... but he is.  And she is!&quot;

	Tomoyo put down her mug and gave Sakura a hug while she cried, and
they sat before the fire and Sakura let out all of the pain and
frustration she was feeling.

	Later that night, Tomoyo realized that Sakura had fallen asleep.  
She stood without waking her, shifted her to lay out on the couch, and
then went to get a blanket for her friend.  As she tucked Sakura in, the
woman rolled over slightly.  &quot;Tomoyo, is it okay for me to stay here
tonight?&quot;

	&quot;Of course.&quot;



	Tomoyo expected to have a hard time sleeping that night, with the
focus of so much of her life sleeping in the next room, but found that
Sakura caused the opposite:  The fact that she was not alone in the
apartment helped her fall asleep quickly.

	A sleep that was interrupted by a gentle shake.  Her eyes opened,
and she made out Sakura&#39;s shadow against the dim lights from the window.  
&quot;Sakura?&quot;

	&quot;Can I sleep with you?&quot;

	Tomoyo nodded, not trusting her voice.  She tried not to watch
Sakura as she peeled off her robe and climbed into bed, but caught herself
watching the reflection in a mirror.

	There was a moment of absolute silence.  And then Sakura&#39;s hand
touched her shoulder.  &quot;Tomoyo, do you still love me?&quot;

	Tomoyo bit her lip.  &quot;yes&quot;  It was barely a whisper.

	&quot;I need some love.&quot;

	Tomoyo almost cried.  This wasn&#39;t right.  Sakura wasn&#39;t turning to
her out of love, but out of need, a reaction to what Syaoran had done to
her.

	But she wasn&#39;t made out of stone, and when Sakura&#39;s hand slid down
to cup her right breast, she turned towards her and gave her a kiss that
contained two decades of pent-up desires.

	It went on from there.
