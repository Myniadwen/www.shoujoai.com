-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&#147;Tomoyo, what are you doing? thought Tomoyo Daidouji as 
Her friend Sakura Kinomoto clad only in a light bathrobe nervously waited
for Tomoyo to instruct her to remove her robe. She had very reluctantly 
agreed to fill in as her figure model, Mizuki, the girl Tomoyo usually 
employed, had had to cancel because of having come down with the flu.

Tomoyo instructed Sakura to step up on the small platform in her room,
and to drop her robe. Sakura complied and let the robe fall giving Tomoyo
full view of her body. Tomoyo gave an almost audible gasp at the sight.
Sakura was not busty, by any means, her breasts being small but firm.
Her hips were a perfect heart shape and her entire body was toned 
and muscular, suggesting quietly restrained power.

Tomoyo had Sakura assume the first pose , a runner in a
sprinting position. This was followed by several other poses that
were all of an athletic nature ,leaping ,catching a ball, tennis
swings being some of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tomoyo spoke to Sakura while Sakura was resting after doing her most
recent pose. As she looked up from her pencil and pad, Tomoyo said,
&#147;Sakura chan, for the next pose, I&#146;d like for it to be a dancing one. I&#146;ll 
come up on the platform to show you how I want you to do it.&#148;

Tomoyo, stepped up onto the platform thinking to herself,&#148; Oh God,
This is crazy, I shouldn&#146;t do this&#147;. 

As children ,Tomoyo&#146;s love for Sakura
had been purely emotional. But now that they were both young women,
love had become mingled with desire. Tomoyo placed Sakura&#146;s right arm
around her waist and had her left hand resting on her shoulder. Tomoyo
realized that she&#146;d put herself into a emotionally charged situation, but she
was beyond the point of no return .The feel of Sakura&#146;s strong but gentle 
hands on her body shattered the last bit of willpower she possessed.

&#147;No I mustn&#146;t ,she&#146;ll hate me, I can&#146;t do it ,I mus&#146;nt ,
I DON&#146;T CARE ANYMORE!!&#148; Tomoyo threw her arms around Sakura 
and kissed her with all the passion in her heart, not caring for whatever 
consequences came because of her actions. Sakura&#146;s mind raced
as Tomoyo kissed her,&#148;OMYGODTOMOYOALLTHISTIMEINEVER
KNEW!!!! Tomoyo after what seemed a small eternity broke the kiss.
&#147;OH GOD SAKURA I&#146;M SORRY!! BUT I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!
PLEASE !! FORGIVE ME!! PLEASE!! she pleaded between sobs, certain
she&#146;d destroyed their friendship forever, Sakura must surely hate her now.

Condemnation never came. &#147;Its alright Tomoyo-chan.&#148; said Sakura
in a gentle voice. &#147;I&#146;ve been a fool all these years.&#148; The one for me 
was always by my side&#147;. &#147;I love you too Tomoyo -chan.&#148;

Sakura picked up Tomoyo and carried her to her bed and laid her gently on it.
She climbed onto the bed and crouched over Tomoyo ,whose tears had turned
into tears of joy and said:&#148; And now It&#146;s time for something long overdue.&#148;

As Sakura began to make love to her, between her joyful sobs, Tomoyo, 
quietly murmured a single word, that expressed her newfound bliss:
Haaayaaan&#133;.. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Authors note: Haaayaan is originally a word used by Sakura to describe the 
warm and fuzzy feeling she has when she sees someone she&#146;s in love with.
