<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 23 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>Kaho Mitsuki smiled slightly as her secretary brought
the documents in. &quot;Why does Tomoyo insist on giving me
a print out now?&quot; the tall, brown haired older woman
wondered out loud as she took the papers from Mei-Lin,
&quot;She could always email it to me.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Mei-lin answered diplomatically, the
Asian girl smiling sweetly as she waited a moment for
further orders.

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that,&quot; Kaho gave her a skeptical look.

Mei-lin shrugged as she admitted, &quot;I think handing you
a printout reduces the temptation to edit her copy.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Kaho smiled, &quot;she forgets I&#39;m a old fashioned
reporter. I can edit her work with a pen as easily as
on my computer.&quot;

&quot;You can edit by pen?&quot; Mei-lin teased, blinking her
eyes innocently as if the idea was completely new to
her.

&quot;Get back to work,&quot; Kaho mock growled at Mei-lin as
she bent over the papers, &quot;before I have to spank
you.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Mei-lin smiled as she turned and headed
back out to her desk just outside of Kaho&#39;s door.

Chuckling to herself Kaho read through the papers,
nodding at times in approval. Tomoyo had done a good
job tracing a scandal in city hall, following the
money right back to the public works manager. The only
annoying thing was that the trail stopped there.
Kaho&#39;s instinct told her it went higher still, but
proving it would be another matter.

Quickly, Kaho opened up a email on her computer.
&quot;Tomoyo,&quot; she wrote, &quot;am approving story, but keep
nosing around. I feel certain there&#39;s more too it than
just the manager.&quot;With a nod she sent it, then sat
back and drank her cold coffee.

&#39;I wonder if I should pull Tomoyo off the Clow case?&#39;
Kaho mused, &#39;She might be losing her edge for the city
related stories.&#39; With a sigh she shook her head, &#39;No,
Tomoyo is our best source on this. No way Sakura would
let anyone else get as close as we are.&#39;

&quot;Chief,&quot; Yukito stuck his head in the door, the
photographer smiling slightly, &quot;a group of us are
going to lunch. Want to come?&quot;

&quot;Am I paying again?&quot; Kaho asked, remembering the last
time she had been stuck with the bill. Yukito, not to
mention the other reporters, ate like starving wolves.

&quot;We&#39;re doing Dutch,&quot; Yukito smiled as he quickly added
the important detail, &quot;and my section gets figured
separately.&quot;

Kaho chuckled as she rose, &quot;Then yeah, I&#39;ll join you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll mind the store,&quot; Mei-lin said as Kaho walked by
then called to the leaving reporters, &quot;but someone
please order me some take out!&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Tomoyo nodded as she held the door for Kaho,
her look just a bit wary.

There had been a bit of tension between the two of
them since they had both been at Sonomi&#39;s birthday
party. Kaho had said she forgave the young lady for
holding back on the Knight of the Clow&#39;s identity, but
clearly Tomoyo wasn&#39;t sure she believed her.

&#39;And I suppose Tomoyo&#39;s right about that, in a way,&#39;
Kaho silently admitted. The truth was she did feel
angry towards Tomoyo, angry and disappointed. She had
believed Tomoyo to be a good, devoted reporter, and
discovering that Tomoyo could willingly withhold key
facts from a story was rather surprising.

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Rika smiled as the group reached a small
caf&eacute; nearby the paper&#39;s offices, a usual hang out for
the staff.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kaho smiled to her as they entered.
&quot;Someone grab the corner table,&quot; she ordered as a few
others headed to the counter.

Within a few minutes several orders of soup,
sandwiches and other items were ordered and on their
way as the reporters took over their usual corner
spot. They sat down and dug in, even as conversation
also began to flow.

&quot;Nice job of the corruption story,&quot; Chiharu Mihara
noted, the assistant editor munching on a roll as her
usual twin ponytails bounced on her shoulders.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Tomoyo smiled, &quot;though I have to confess to
getting lucky, too. If I hadn&#39;t been out chasing the
Knight story, I&#39;d never have seen the bribe exchange
with the city director of public works.&quot;

&quot;At least you were sharp enough to spot it,&quot; Rika
noted.

&quot;And to do the digging to find out what was going on,&quot;
Kaho agreed.

Tomoyo blushed charmingly. &quot;Anyway,&quot; she waved that
off, &quot;how deep do you think his honor the mayor is in
on this?&quot;

Chiharu sighed, &quot;Yamazaki is a habitual liar, was
since school.&quot; She paused, &quot;I still find it hard to
believe he got elected.&quot;

Rika cleared her throat and gave Tomoyo a pointed
look.

&#39;Oh, they were school friends,&#39; Kaho suddenly
remembered. All three of them, Rika, Chiharu and the
mayor Yamazaki had gone to school together, only
separating in high school. There were also rumors
around the office that Yamazaki and Chiharu had been
more than just friends, too.

&quot;So,&quot; Yukito changed the subject a bit, &quot;Have any of
you read Naoko Yanagisawa&#39;s new novel?&quot; He smiled even
as he filled his face with food, &quot;I really liked it.&quot;

&quot;Hard to believe out daydreaming friend could become
such a good novelist,&quot; Chiharu agreed brightly. &quot;I
don&#39;t usually like fantasy but I got pulled in.&quot;

&quot;I heard she got a good quote from Nenene Sumerigawa,&quot;
Tomoyo noted, &quot;and she&#39;s infamous in not giving out
quotes.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never tried it,&quot; Kaho admitted, &quot;what&#39;s it
about?&quot;

&quot;A girl finds a magic book that brings her dreams to
life,&quot; Rika explained, &quot;but things turn out much more
messy than she expects.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Kaho admitted.

&quot;I&#39;ll lend you my copy later,&quot; Tomoyo offered
cheerfully.

Kaho nodded, &quot;Thanks, I may take you up on that.&quot; As
she spooned up some soup she reflected, &#39;I wonder if
Tomoyo and Sonomi are talking more? They actually
seemed to be getting along a few days ago...&#39;

If anything good had come out of that disastrous
birthday party, it had been a thawing of the ongoing
cold war between Sonomi and Tomoyo. The attendance at
the birthday party and the attack of the Water had
been messy, but after the food fight in the back yard
Sonomi and Tomoyo had nearly seemed friendly.

&#39;Of course,&#39; Kaho thought as she polished off her
sandwich, &#39;I can&#39;t arrange a disaster at each event I
get the two of them to attend.&#39; She smirked, &#39;Though I
suppose I could ask Sakura to pull something...&#39;

&quot;You have the most evil smile on your face, boss,&quot;
Chiharu noted, &quot;you aren&#39;t planning something bad at
work, are you?&quot;

Kaho fought back a blush at how transparent her
expression must have been. &quot;Would I do that?&quot; she
asked with a smile.

&quot;In a minute,&quot; both Chiharu, Rika, Tomoyo and Yukito
chimed together.

Kaho scowled, &quot;Just wait till raise time, you&#39;ll
regret that.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Yukito said quietly, &quot;the day before
we&#39;ll convince Sonomi to do something nice for you, so
you&#39;ll be in a VERY good mood.&quot;

&quot;Sexist,&quot; Tomoyo slapped him on the arm, &quot;Just because
things work like that between you and Toya does not
mean it works that way for Kaho.&quot;

&quot;Are you implying that I&#39;m easy?&quot; Yukito tried to look
offended but his smile sort of countered that.

&quot;You said it,&quot; Rika snickered.

&#39;My staff is crazy,&#39; Kaho thought as they got the bill
from a amused waitress, &#39;but damn are they
entertaining.&#39;</pre>
