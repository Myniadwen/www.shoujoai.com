<h1>Remastered III (part 5 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster3-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Nina just didn&#146;t know what was worst. The fact that Misho invited 
Sakura&#146;s class to the Zoo--- or, to be more precise, HER Zoo (which 
she was a major stockholder in)--- on the last day of school before 
the Winter Break--- or that it smelled too much like a set-up that 
even Nina couldn&#146;t ignore it.

It just seemed too convenient. That on the last day of school Misho 
would somehow con the school to allow this field trip and they bought 
it hook, line, and sucker. Now, mind you, normally a field trip 
couldn&#146;t possibly have been run through the paces and scheduled on 
such short notice, let alone set for the last day of school before a 
major break from school. Still somehow she did it and that made Nina 
nervous.

The morning of the trip Nina woke up early, rolling over to stare 
listlessly at her portable computer she leaves on the nightstand every 
night before bed so she could do a run through of the camera monitors 
about town before breakfast. Eliza was still asleep, and the morning 
light was barely coming over the &#147;horizon&#148; so she figured now would be 
as good a time as any to do the morning runthrough rituals.

With a slight stifled yawn she slowly sits up, pulling the computer 
towards her as she pops it open with a push of her finger and begins 
to type the commands in (not using vocal commands because she was 
worried she would wake Eliza).

The computer responded, slowly going through the entire cycle of 
images from each &#147;Station&#148; set about from the school, to town, to New 
King Penguin Park, to--- that&#146;s when she jams a finger down on the 
stop button in a slight annoyance. Something wasn&#146;t right. With a 
slight yawn she flicks back through the images for a second until she 
finds one that didn&#146;t seem kosher.

It was the camera pod mounted in the head of King Penguin (the slide) 
in the park. But for some reason the image was inverted, as if the 
camera was filming upside down, and at a wrong angle at that 
considering how tall King Penguin was. Nina sighs as she sets the scan 
to go again, running a hand through her short green hair. &#147;Damn kids 
found the camera again.&#148;

Three times to date someone had found the camera hidden in King 
Penguin&#146;s head, and had somehow sabotaged it. Once the camera was 
hooked onto one of the small penguins surrounding the statue, once it 
was buried in the sand around King Penguin, and once somebody tried to 
use it to peek on women in the women&#146;s bathroom (Nina however never 
reported the &#147;peep&#148; video to anyone and still has it.)

Whoever found the camera this time had somehow rigged it to hang 
upside down (maybe it was just lying at the base of the slide). Either 
way? It only meant more work for Nina. She&#146;d have to spin by New King 
Penguin Park on the way to Sakura&#146;s &#147;field trip&#148; and take the camera 
back again. She&#146;d then have to sneak in at night and rehide the 
camera--- maybe this time in King Penguin&#146;s &#147;mouth&#148;.

Nina&#146;s day wasn&#146;t starting off right, and somehow she felt it&#146;d only 
get worst.

------

Breakfast was OK, and Tomoyo was on cloud nine with Sakura&#146;s cooking. 
She always was on cloud nine so that was nothing new to Nina. Still, 
it wasn&#146;t something Nina looked forward to seeing.

Occasionally in the morning, when the two ate breakfast, Tomoyo became 
a little playful and fed Sakura by hand. Literally by hand. She&#146;d take 
bits of the meal and gingerly press them between Sakura&#146;s lips 
bringing a soft sigh and giggle from her. And, in turn, she would do 
likewise for Tomoyo.

Sakura smiled as she felt Tomoyo&#146;s fingers press another bite of food 
into her mouth, which she chewed with deliberate ease savoring each 
morsel.

That was something Nina just didn&#146;t want to see at the breakfast 
table. That was bedroom stuff. She didn&#146;t force them to watch her feed 
Eliza and vice versa, so what&#146;s up with them doing it to her?

Eliza trudged downstairs and ate also. For once she wasn&#146;t down before 
Nina, and it was mostly because they had been on alert since the Fight 
card harmed Sakura and everyone was pitching in on the search for 
Fight. However, while Nina was used to late nights and long hours 
Eliza was not. So while Nina made it through last night with flying 
colors, Eliza was wiped out. Then again--- Nina smirks as she nudges 
Eliza into her chair, gaining a slight smile from her--- she might not 
have been so wiped if Nina wasn&#146;t so energetic last night in bed. At 
that thought Nina giggled a little, but fell back to her grumpy mood 
fast.

&#147;You OK? That doesn&#146;t look like a happy face.&#148; Nina sighs as she 
watches Eliza begin to eat, her eyes still weary as she slowly chewed 
her food. &#147;I don&#146;t know how you make it through each night.&#148;

&#147;Lots of caffeine helps, though I was definitely on the ball last 
night to have rolled you under in &#147;three&#147;.&#148; Nina offers, watching her 
eat. &#147;How about you two? How did you---&#148; (stops as she notices 
Sakura/Tomoyo were talking amongst themselves again) &#147;---never mind.&#148;

As she walked out of the kitchen area to grab her jacket she noticed 
the TV in kitchen area was on and tuned onto the news. Now since there 
was a TV in each room this one was used by Sonomi as she got ready for 
work (so she could watch while she ate breakfast). There, on the news, 
was an unfortunate sight that Nina knew she would probably see 
(considering where they were going today) but dreaded.

King Penguin, upside down. Figures why the transmission from the 
camera in King Penguin&#146;s head wasn&#146;t working properly, the slide 
itself was turned upside down.

As for who did it? It could only have been Power. But that&#146;s when she 
saw something else. Quickly Nina moved forward and looked closely at 
the TV. There, on King Penguin&#146;s upside down head was a mark--- a 
symbol of some kind etched into the hard body of the slide penguin. As 
she stared at it, Nina&#146;s teeth ground together and her eyes narrowed.

It was an Assassin Guilder insignia, but not one she recognized right 
away.

Which meant there was an assassin guilder involved in this---- but 
how, and why?

With a slight groan, Nina slipped her jacket on, realizing that a trip 
past King Penguin might be needed after all (just for different 
reasons than she planned for that morning.

------

The skate down to the park was almost uneventful.

And it would have stayed that way if only for one thing.

Nina was having a bad day since Eliza wanted to go Christmas shopping 
and left Nina the sole job of watching Sakura. And, which by the way 
irked her the most, they ran into Keiko on the way to the park. Both 
of these situations, combined, worsened Nina&#146;s already bad mood.

Tomoyo skillfully puts herself between Sakura and the two as they 
blade down to the park. Keiko, in her usual demeanor as she jogs next 
to them, looks at Nina with a bit of mischief in her expression.

&#147;Anyone see the Penguin slide on the news this morning?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, yeah.&#148; Nina shot off irritated, knowing what Keiko was prodding 
at.

&#147;Didn&#146;t flip itself over, you know that right?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, yeah.&#148; she again shot off, irritated.

&#147;Think someone did that for it, right?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, yeah.&#148;

&#147;And there&#146;s a letter for you from Marco Ramius in your pocket.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, yeah.&#148; (&#145;Jerk&#146; Nina said to herself as she skated on, trying to 
ignore Keiko.)

&#147;Gee.&#148; Keiko sighs as they reach the Penguin slide, surrounded by the 
media and police, &#147;Nothing really phases you once your in boredom 
mode.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, yeah.&#148;

&#147;-----&#148;

As they all looked on, the news crews were giving their thoughts on 
the thing as police, Alliance Officers, and two ACT officers (Advanced 
Counter Terrorism, ACT for short) poked around the penguin.

&#147;It&#146;s Power.&#148; Sakura suddenly whispers, her eyes looking over King 
Penguin very carefully. &#147;I can sense her. She was here last night.&#148;

&#147;And what about that?&#148; Nina asks, pointing at the penguin slide and 
the symbol etched on it.

&#147;I know---&#148; Sakura whispers as everyone edges closer to listen, 
attentions piqued. &#147;I know---&#148;

&#147;---absolutely nothing about that.&#148;

Nina faints. She quickly gets up as Sakura, blushing, turns to Tomoyo, 
&#147;Maybe it&#146;s graffiti?&#148;

&#147;Power might be picking up an artistic sense.&#148; Tomoyo added, to which 
Nina scoffed. &#147;Or it&#146;s an insignia from an Assassins&#146; Guild.&#148;

&#147;Assassins&#146; Guild?&#148; she and Sakura asked together.

As they bladed away, Nina took over the conversation. &#147;Assassins&#146; 
Guild. Remember Thunder&#145;s &#147;partner&#147; it merged with? One of those 
fellows.&#148;

&#147;Who is it this time?&#148; Keiko asked, to which Nina shook her head. 
&#147;Dunno. Can&#146;t imagine anyone putting a contract out on &#147;King Penguin&#148;, 
of all things, but there&#146;s got to be more to this than a simple case 
of &#147;penguin tipping&#148;.&#148;

&#147;Guess we&#146;ll find out soon enough, we&#146;re almost to the zoo.&#148;

&#147;I know---&#148; Nina sighed, the zoo fast approaching. As she and Keiko 
drifted off to talk, Sakura/Tomoyo exchanged worried glances and begin 
to talk as well. &#147;Is it power?&#148;

&#147;Hoe----&#148; Sakura moaned, her senses focusing back to what she saw at 
King Penguin. For a few seconds nothing then, &#147;I sensed something--- I 
guess it&#146;s Power but---&#148;

&#147;You couldn&#146;t tell?&#148;

&#147;There was something else there--- muddled her power somehow.&#148;

&#147;Muddled?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s hard to explain.&#148; Sakura tried to word, her hands motioning back 
and forth as if to signify something growing and shrinking. &#147;I felt 
her power, but something tried to mask it--- the feeling was weak.&#148;

&#147;Who? Could it be Mimic?&#148; Tomoyo asked, to which Sakura could only 
shake her head &#147;No, it doesn&#145;t feel like Clow energy at all--- 
something--- different.&#148; Undaunted, Tomoyo pecked Sakura on the cheek 
as they reached their classmates, &#147;You&#146;ll figure it out. Don&#146;t worry.&#148;

&#147;Thanks, Tomoyo-chan---&#148; Sakura answered, her voice trailing away 
until, &#147;I don&#146;t want to fight Clow Cards today. Can&#146;t we have a normal 
happy day today?&#148;

Tomoyo smiles and takes Sakura&#146;s hand, leading her brave Cardcaptor to 
their classmates.

-------

The zoo was kinda quiet, and it was no wonder as to why.

Christmas was only days away. People were far busier doing their last 
minute shopping than they were going to the zoo. Even the animals felt 
the decline in business and were taking the days off because there 
wasn&#146;t much people to show off to. That, more than anything, riled 
Misho&#146;s fur something fierce.

Perhaps planning the trip for today was abit of a whismical whim, she 
thought to herself as she watched the students gathering near the 
entrance, but she needed the break that a possible new card incident 
might bring and wasn&#146;t afraid to make things &#147;happen&#148; to get where she 
wanted to.

That&#146;s when she noticed Nina staring at her with an askew expression.

She didn&#146;t need to ask to know what was biting Nina in the rear, and 
she didn&#146;t care.

&#147;Just as long as the card shows up on time.&#148; she muttered to herself, 
&#147;It&#146;ll all be worth it.&#148;

-------

Sakura looked about the entrance to the zoo. Huge wrought iron gates 
stood ahead, leading into the gigantic Tokyo Zoo, major stockholder 
being one Misho NamoCatCat. The zoo wasn&#146;t doing very brisk business 
this later into Christmas so Sakura anticipated a quiet day at the 
zoo. And, should trouble come, she thought it would make it easier on 
her with less people to avoid using her magic in front of.

Tomoyo stood by her patiently, and with her calming smile relaxing 
Sakura&#146;s tense nerves. They had talked to length about what might 
possibly be the card that Misho wanted Sakura to know about through 
her unexpected &#147;field trip&#148; offer to the school. And, as the two 
thrashed out the ideas, one card kept coming up as the likely 
candidate. That being Power, the card that came to the zoo once before 
and was sealed by Sakura here during her first time as Card Captor 
Sakura.

But to think that Power was going to return to the &#147;scene of the 
crime&#148; that she visited the first time was abit of a stretch. Even 
Kero&#146;s &#147;crime show&#148; logic of this being right up Power&#146;s &#147;alley&#148; just 
didn&#146;t seem to synch for Sakura. There had to be more to Power&#146;s 
return than a trip down memory lane.

As the class began, Mr. Terada once again handed out cameras and broke 
the class into groups, and this time besides Naoko, Rika and Chiharu 
being part of the group they also got Nina, Eliza and Misho (Misho 
coming in as they walked in one direction). &#147;What?&#148; Misho growled, 
noticing Nina&#146;s inquisitive eyes staring directly at her as they 
started walking. &#147;Got any explanation? King Penguin for example?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know nothing about King Penguin. I just wanted to see where 
you were goi---&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t lie to me.&#148; Nina shot back, not even letting Misho finish her 
sentence, &#147;There&#146;s a card around here, isn&#146;t there.&#148;

&#147;I never said there was a ca---&#148;

&#147;And there you go, lying a---&#148;

&#147;DO YOU MIND?&#148; Misho hisses, her voice falling silent as she realizes 
the others were watching her. As they went back to animal watching she 
drew Nina closer, &#147;If one shows up I&#146;d thought you&#146;d be grateful that 
I&#146;d save you all the work of tracking it down yourself. But you with 
your ingrateful-ness!&#148;

&#147;Show gratitude for a publicity ploy from you? Heaven forbid.&#147; Nina 
countered, &#147;If only your motives was as pure and benevolent as you 
make them sound someone might actually believe them.&#148;

The two split apart and walk on opposite sides of the girls without 
saying another word.

-----

Sakura had two things on her mind.

Pictures of penguins and pictures of elephants.

No Clow Cards, no work, just herself, Tomoyo-chan, and the animals.

Sakura had a love of penguins, but she also liked elephants a lot.

Tomoyo, being the keeper of the camera, was game.

Tomoyo, though, had three things on her mind.

Pictures of the penguins, the elephants, and Sakura-chan--- oh, my.

The others? Well, they were as much game as Sakura &amp; Tomoyo so that 
fit their plans rather well. All they had to do was head for the 
elephant enclosure first and start the photo-ops.

That&#146;s when the topic came up.

&#147;Anyone hear about the penguin slide?&#148; Chiharu asked, to which Naoko 
nodded her head, &#147;Hmm. I heard a ghost did it.&#148;

&#147;OOOoooh! That&#146;d be so cool if that were true!&#148; Rika sighed, &#147;It&#146;d 
make for a great picture for the class assignment.&#148;

&#147;And not only that---&#148; Nina added, leaning forward towards Sakura as 
she did, &#147;---it&#146;d be such a kick, especially if we saw a ghost right 
NOW!&#148;

&#147;Elephants!&#148; Sakura suddenly blurted out, running away as fast as she 
could. As Nina giggled she caught a disapproving glance from Tomoyo, 
which caused her to grumble &#147;What?!&#148; as she passed by. &#147;It&#146;s not my 
fault she&#146;s such a baby about gh---&#148; (whack) &#147;---Eliza!&#148;

&#147;Behave.&#148; she sternly whispered, looking over to where Sakura was 
standing (shivering) waiting for Tomoyo to draw closer to comfort her. 
&#147;Do you really need to get on Sakura&#146;s case like that?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s my one and only joy in this job.&#148; Nina grumbles, &#147;And I thought 
you were ditching on me today to go Christmas shopping? So don&#146;t take 
my one legally in public joy in life away from me.&#148;

&#147;Nina---&#148; (Eliza leans over and kisses Nina softly on the lips) 
&#147;There&#146;s lots of joys that can be shared in public, and not just 
teasing Sakura.&#148;

&#147;I guess---&#147; Nina sighed, knowing that once she felt Eliza&#146;s soft lips 
against her own that she wouldn&#146;t be able to resist her anymore today. 
Sigh. &#147;By the way,&#148; Nina suddenly changed the subject, a thought 
occurring to her, &#147;---out of curiosity, where&#146;s Rena? I thought she 
was coming today for this trip?&#148;

&#147;She said she might have business today---&#148; Eliza responded, looking 
about wondering the same thing Nina was wondering a few seconds 
before.

-------

Sakura and Tomoyo, meanwhile, found a minute for a little private time 
between them as they waited for the next elephant exhibition to begin.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry----&#148; Sakura whispered, looking embarrassed, but Tomoyo only 
smiled and poked her on the cheeks with one finger each. &#147;You just 
don&#146;t like ghost very much, do you?&#148;

&#147;I should be brave for you--- I want to be brave for you.&#148;

&#147;You are brave for me. More than you could possibly imagine---&#148; she 
whispered, her voice trailing off abit as she grew misty eyed and 
reflective. As she thought, Sakura&#146;s eyes turned to her. Shocked, 
Tomoyo shook herself out of her own thoughts and went back to watching 
over Sakura. &#147;Never mind. I&#146;ll tell you about it someday. Come on, I 
want to take a picture of you with the elephants.&#148;

In the distance, unknown to them, someone was watching.

But, for the time being, the only thing that mattered to the two young 
women were each other as Sakura ran over to pose in front of the 
elephant enclosure while Tomoyo snapped a few shots with both the 
disposable camera from the school and her own camera she bought for 
the field trip.

But still, someone was watching them.

-------

If there was one thing that was abundantly clear at this point, it was 
simply this---

Power was bored.

Beyond all descriptions of the word. Beyond all meaning of the word. 
Power was bored.

She was bored of the stakeout, and of the watching, and nothing she 
could think of as she sat there watching what was transpiring below 
would relieve that boredom.

She kicked her feet aimlessly, waiting for some word of when they 
would act.

But, as she sat there, she only received a gentle &#147;Patience, Miss 
Power, patience.&#148; and a gesture for her to take a nap while they 
waited from her partner, an armored male dressed in the gear and 
protective armoring of the Assassin Guild for which he belongs, Raven 
Guild. In the dim sunlight his dark black armor glistened, the light 
reflecting slightly off his visor as he dropped his rifle abit to gaze 
down at her.

True, while she didn&#146;t want to be down for too long, she knew that 
there was no talking him out of the waiting as long as he called the 
shots. Once he set his mind towards something it pretty much stood set 
and it took a lot of effort to change that mindset. And, as she 
grudgingly relented, they didn&#146;t have the time to talk about it now. 
And since there really was nothing she could do about the boredom, she 
relented to the idea of sleeping until they moved.

Besides her, the man in the dark black Raven Guild Assassin&#146; Guilder 
armor took abit of time to adjust the sights on his sniper scope on 
the plasma rifle he carried and waited. It was only a matter of time 
before he had a clear shot, but it wasn&#146;t much longer.

With that, Technocrat flipped open the visor plating and drew another 
sip of his drink as he watched for the target to show up. There was 
still time, and nobody seemed to be moving too fast to go anywhere. 
Even so, time was running out to deliver on the target packet.

The target seemed to be there already, mind you, but there was no 
confirmation. All he knew was that the target was present, but not 
where the target was at this moment. One other thing, he knew the 
target would pass by the elephant enclosure, all he had to do was wait 
for the target and then---

Keep waiting, and the target would come to them, and as this moment 
that was his thoughts on the situation. And, as he himself relented 
earlier, that&#146;s all they could do now.

Still, he had his thoughts and opinions as to who wanted this hit 
carried out. And, being the well connected individual that he was, 
when Technocrat formed an opinion like that he was almost always dead 
right on when he made an opinion on something. He wondered however if 
this would be the first time that he was proven wrong on an opinion he 
formed. If nothing else, he knew one thing opinion or no, and that was 
that the target was coming. That alone, that was what was important at 
that time.

Still, he didn&#146;t like to wait, and wondered why the delay.

The answer would come sooner than he thought it would, but for now---

Something suddenly catches his eye, and brings the rifle back up. It 
was showtime.

Alliance Command - Citadel City

It was as if all the alarms were going off at once, and Admiral 
Nobringa just didn&#146;t want to deal with it today. As she walked down 
the corridor to the &#147;pit&#146;, all about her she was bathed in a bright 
red from the flashing red alert lights as everyone scurried about. 
Seconds later she was joined by Temsik (who was a little slower 
dressing than Nobringa) as they piled into the hover elevator which 
directly linked to the command chamber. As the elevator moved, 
Nobringa pulled slightly on Temsik&#146;s pants. &#147;You seemed so much more 
lively before you moved into my quarters and we started being an 
item.&#148;

&#147;Your very energetic in bed, Rai&#145;chal.&#148;

&#147;Flattery got you in there in the first place, so I guess it&#146;ll get 
you far---&#148; she remarks, only to feel Temsik draw near. &#147;I&#146;m glad 
you&#146;re here with me. You&#145;ve always been with me, I---&#148;

&#147;I know--- I&#145;m glad we could be like this--- I love you too.&#148; she 
sighs as she feels the lift slowing, the two stealing a quick kiss 
before entering the huge &#147;pit&#148; area.

The main command chamber, a.k.a. &#147;the pit&#148;, is a huge room that drops 
downward into a circular &#147;pit&#148; of rows upon rows of tech computer 
stations manned with teams of tech officers, data gatherers, and 
Alliance Command personnel. Each level, sinking down tier after tier, 
lowers towards a central platform where several workstations lie 
strung out along the outer &#147;circle&#148; of the platform, and a huge round 
table with seven chairs occupied the space in it&#145;s center. It&#146;s in 
this area that central area where Nobringa and Temsik went to, pouring 
over the pads of data left for them as it came in.

On the huge screen to one side of the room&#146;s upper walls, everyone 
watched the latest telemetry.

On another screen, a Captain of a Datalus class Winterian Frigate was 
in constant contact with the center, her voice cracking abit as the 
stress wore on her nerves. Her ship was several parsecs out of the 
&#147;ring&#148; of dreamspace and into Elsespace (the white infinite void 
beyond the dream layer).

&#147;The rifts slowly expanding by the hour, growing wider as time 
passes.&#148;

------

From her post on the bridge of her vessel, Captain Antilles had a 
clear view of the near invisible rift forming before them. The room&#146;s 
full on CombatHoloSystem was on, which made the rift visible.

The system, utilizing holovisors and a bridge encompassing 
holo-system, gathered data from outside the ship and projected a full 
out 360 degree &#147;outside view&#148; on the bridge. The effect was as if the 
entire bridge melts away (except for key posts like helm stations, the 
captain&#146;s chair, weapons stations and so forth) showing the space 
outside. That made it easier for gunnery officers to bring the ship&#146;s 
weaponry to bear on targets attacking from any angle, as well as made 
the helmsofficer&#146;s job of piloting in tight situations easier since it 
gave the officer a clear view of his/her surroundings without the 
limitations of a viewscreen or sensor readings.

The CHS (short for &#147;CombatHoloSystem&#148;) was set for tachyon particles 
and that&#146;s how the rift was first sighted in the empty &#147;noise&#148; that 
existed in ElseSpace. The rift, which started small, was slowly 
beginning to grow hour upon hour upon hour. It was only in the last 
hour or so that they detected a huge object within the rift itself--- 
something waiting to come out.

&#147;Has anything passed through the rift yet?&#148; Admiral Nobringa asked, to 
which she shook her head, &#147;That&#146;s a negative. Nothing has passed 
through yet, but from our readings here---&#148; she pauses to check her 
readings one more time before replying, &#147;---it looks like whatever it 
is that is stuck between realities is about the size of a small 
moon--- perhaps, if I were to hazard a guess, a Dyson Sphere.&#148;

------

Several gasps and worried groans spread throughout the &#147;pit&#148;.

A Dyson Sphere. In theory, an artificially created mobile &#145;world&#146; with 
it&#146;s own ecosystem and even a miniature artificial &#147;sun&#148; within the 
center of that &#147;world&#148;&#146;s &#147;space&#147;. Dyson Sphere were, theoretically, a 
conceived of possible last ditch attempt to flee a dying homeworld. To 
date, however, the existence of Dyson Spheres was only theoretical in 
nature. No world in the known galaxy in the last 5000 years had ever 
had the ability or resources to build a Dyson Sphere, even in the 
gravest of emergencies, so to see one now--- it boggled the mind, and 
excited while also terrified the people in the &#147;pit&#148; at the same time.

&#147;How long before the rift is wide enough to allow the sphere through?&#148; 
Nobringa asked.

&#147;Between seven to ten more days.&#148;

&#147;Then there&#146;s nothing more to be done. Best come back to the &#147;barn&#148; 
and release your crew for holiday on schedule.&#148;

Stunned silence.

&#147;B-b-but---&#148;

Nobringa cut her off before she could continue, &#147;We can&#146;t keep this 
under wraps if people note that a starship is hanging out in the 
middle of nowhere for no apparent reason. And, as you stated in your 
earlier report, the rift is hidden by the hard vacuum &#147;noise&#148; of 
Elsespace so nobody will notice it for the time being. And, according 
to estimates, we have until after Christmas to New Years&#146; before the 
rift sends out it&#146;s &#147;passenger&#148; so we have time.&#148;

&#147;Isn&#146;t there anything we can do now?&#148;

&#147;For now just drop some monitoring probes and we&#146;ll keep track of the 
growth from here. But that&#146;s that, return to base and release your 
crew for break. That&#146;s all you can do until we know more.&#148;

And, with that, the link was severed.

As Nobringa leaned back in her chair, she felt Temsik&#146;s fingers 
working on her shoulders. All her aide ever wanted out of life is 
peace of mind for her superior officer--- the two living together 
since September seemed to make that &#147;task&#148; easier for her. Nobringa 
sighed, &#146;I have to remember to return the favor tonight.&#146; she thought 
to herself.

From the walkway heading up towards the lifts, someone walked into 
their area and sat down. Nobringa didn&#146;t need to look up from her 
slouched position to know who it was. She simply waited as he sat, 
wrote out something on a piece of paper, and pushed it towards her to 
read.

&#147;IT IS EVERYTHING THE TRANSMISSIONS HINT IT TO BE--- TIMES 20.&#148;

&#147;Oh, sure---&#148; Nobringa sighs, not hiding her irritation for a second, 
as she pushes the paper back to the male, &#147;---kick us while we&#146;re down 
why dontcha. Any other words of cheer, Captain Lazarus?&#148;

&#147;Killing the messenger won&#146;t make the message sound any better than it 
is right now.&#147; Captain Lazaruas remarked in an even tone of voice, 
&#147;CLAMP School will soon be in &#147;Session&#148;, my friend--- whether we like 
it or not.&#148;

&#147;So it&#146;s true--- what the Goddess of the Paths said a few days ago---&#148; 
Nobringa mutters, feeling Temsik pick up her pace trying to rub out 
the pain slowly forming in Nobringa&#146;s body. &#147;---should we---&#148;

&#147;For the time being---&#148; Jack lays out, slowly choosing his words as he 
speaks, &#147;I think it&#146;s best that we don&#146;t involve Kotobuki or the 
others just yet--- at least, not until there&#146;s something to involve 
them in.&#148;

------

Meanwhile, back at the Tokyo Zoo.

The elephant show was improved slightly since last time.

This time, besides a tug of war against volunteers from the audience 
(students), it also did a tug of war against a small mobile crate 
moving mecha (and the mecha always lost to the elephant).

The pictures Tomoyo was taking promised to be stunning, and this time 
(mused Sakura) she didn&#146;t have any interference from a Clow card. As 
for King Penguin? It had to have been Power. Maybe she was just bored 
and wanted to entertain herself. Once she had enough of being human 
she&#146;d return to Sakura and become a card again. But, for now, Power 
was trying to find anyway to amuse herself. Though, and this thought 
made Sakura particularly happy, as long as she didn&#146;t find 
entertainment at the zoo while Sakura was there then she didn&#146;t mind 
what Power did to keep herself occupied (as long as nobody was hurt).

Suddenly she felt Tomoyo draw closer, her head coming to rest on 
Sakura&#146;s shoulder as they watched the elephants. Sakura sighed 
happily, enjoying Tomoyo&#146;s reassuring presence near her as she enjoyed 
Tomoyo herself. Sakura draws an arm around Tomoyo&#146;s waist, and draws 
her close.

Tomoyo was with her, her friends was with her, and everything was 
perfect.

&#147;Lunch!&#148;

Sakura suddenly facefaults as the other girls in their group suddenly 
turn and walk off.

&#147;---so much for the romantic moment---&#148; Sakura sighed, irritated that 
everyone just walked off for lunch on such short notice. They didn&#146;t 
even bother asking if they wanted to go along. Tomoyo, sensing 
Sakura&#146;s frustration, poked at the huge lunch she was carrying for 
them and smiled. &#147;Maybe we can refind our romantic moment after a 
little lunch?&#148;

&#147;Ok.&#148; Sakura relented, knowing that Tomoyo was only thinking of her 
when she made the suggestion. &#147;Let&#146;s eat then.&#148;

Suddenly, a thought crossed her mind, and she suddenly went dashing 
off towards the wooded area between off to one side (where visitors 
could rest during their walk through the zoo) in a panic.

------

&#147;He didn&#146;t sneak along this time.&#148; Tomoyo noted, pointing at the bag 
one more time. They had already set out lunch and this time no 
Kerberos. The bag only contained lunch, a pouch of Tomoyo&#146;s batteries 
for her cameras, and some spare film. No extra passengers.

Sakura, just for good measure, looks one more time before she goes 
back to eating. &#147;I was sure he was hiding in there again.&#148;

&#147;I think Kero is far too happy with staying at home and---&#148; Tomoyo 
stops, noticing Sakura&#146;s sour expression. &#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know--- I just want to be alone with you today---&#148; she 
laments, looking about her, the small wooded area was covered in a 
light snow cover, the three bare but yet there was enough cover around 
them so they had a measure of privacy. Still, as she knew, they were 
not really alone. But that didn&#146;t matter to Tomoyo in the slightest as 
she cuddled up next to Sakura and helped her dig into their lunches.

As they ate, Tomoyo would occasional give Sakura a squeeze or lean on 
her shoulder, a little something here and there so that, even with 
everyone around them, it seemed as if they were having an intimate 
lunch in a very private place just for the two of them to enjoy.

Finally, after they finished their meal and took to laying in the snow 
staring at the sky for a few minutes, Sakura&#146;s worry lines faded and 
she began to smile again.

&#147;Now that&#146;s the kind of expression I cherish from you, Sakura-chan.&#148; 
Tomoyo whispers, poking Sakura&#146;s cheek as she does, &#147;Your smile is 
very important to me.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan---&#148; Sakura whispered happily, rolling over to bring her 
head against Tomoyo&#146;s chest now as she laid in Tomoyo&#146;s arms, &#147;Do you 
think we&#146;ll ever--- I mean--- get married--- like Meilin---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure we will.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m happy--- I---&#148; Sakura stammers, blushing as she looks into 
Tomoyo&#146;s eyes, &#147;---I---&#148;

A loud explosion rocks the ground, as if something fell out of the 
sky.

Instinctively, Sakura grabs onto Tomoyo, crying out. As the seconds 
pass, Tomoyo looks about.

&#147;That must be Power. Sakura---&#148;

&#147;NO!! I don&#146;t want our happiness to end! Let someone else do it!&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan.&#148; Tomoyo gasped, looking down at her love, shivering as 
she held her.

&#147;I don&#146;t want our special moments to be always interrupted by Clow 
Cards! I want my life back!! I don&#146;t want to be the Mistress of the 
Cards anymore!! I want you!! I want you!!&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan---&#148; Tomoyo whispered, drawing Sakura up to eye level, 
&#147;That&#146;ll never change. We&#146;ll always be together---&#148; (another 
explosion)

&#147;I want to be a normal girl again--- a girl in love--- I don&#146;t want to 
do this anymore---&#148;

&#147;I know, I know---&#148; she sighs, holding Sakura tight, &#147;---but you made 
a vow that you would. As I vowed I&#146;d always be at your side, as long 
as you&#146;d have me.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t want to lose you! I love you!&#148;

&#147;Then there&#146;s nothing to be worried about.&#148; (explosion) &#147;Now I want 
you to dry those tears and let&#146;s get going. I know it&#146;s hard but as 
long as I&#146;m here I won&#146;t let you carry your burdens alone.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan---&#148; Sakura whimpered, before finally pulling herself 
together and standing up. &#147;You&#146;re right! I can&#146;t let this happen---&#148; 
she pulls Tomoyo to her feet and the two race out of the small wooded 
area towards the disturbance.

-------

As the two reached the elephant enclosure they saw something that 
brought them to a halt.

Power, quite visible, was using her power to bench press a 7 foot tall 
mecha suit. Somebody had apparently snuck a tessaract gem into the 
park with the suit, and was using it now for some reason.

Sakura gasped, watching as Power, eyes narrowed and focused, used 
simply motioned with her hands to lift the huge armor off the ground 
without touching it.

&#147;I don&#146;t believe it---&#148; Sakura gasped.

&#147;She&#146;s using telekinesis---&#148; Tomoyo whispered, her camcorder going 
since they left the trees recording everything they saw. Sakura 
couldn&#145;t understand what was happening, &#147;---but how--- gasp!&#148;

She then remembered something.

-------

Years ago--- King Penguin Park

Sakura wanted to flip King Penguin back rightside up, she just knew 
however that it wasn&#146;t going to be an easy task. She could pick up 
King Penguin easy enough, but she didn&#146;t know how to get it right side 
up now that she had it. Holding it was no problem with Power&#146;s power, 
but still---

&#147;Levitate and flip it.&#148;

Both Sakura &amp; Tomoyo turns over to Kero, Sakura blushing abit. 
&#147;Levitate?&#148;

&#147;How&#146;d you think a little girl like Power could lift that elephant so 
high? Let alone give it that toss when her small body size would have 
made that difficult even with her power levels?&#148;

Silence. Kero sighs and he elaborates for the two of them.

&#147;She&#146;s the embodiment of power, but not merely physical power. For 
instance, those craters she left while invisible? Wasn&#146;t merely her 
jumping. She used her mind to cushion her jumps in a dramatic manner 
with a &#147;shockwave&#148; that created those craters. She also can use her 
power to thrash things, or bench press large objects and hurtle them 
into the air with minimum effort. One of her better tricks I have to 
say.&#148;

&#147;Tricks?!?&#148; Sakura blushed, only to realize that Tomoyo had taken her 
picture.

------

&#147;Tomo-chan---&#148; Sakura sighs, remembering the awkward moment with Yuki 
when he saw that picture of her bench pressing King Penguin, blushing 
at Kero&#146;s idea of her levitating the huge slide. She eventually 
flipped it over and got it in place, but she remembered just now how 
Kero said Power had more &#147;power&#148; than she let on.

With a swipe of her arm she sends the armor flying into the air, just 
as she did the elephant a few years ago. Sakura, holding her wand out, 
takes a step forward. &#147;Pow---&#148;

&#147;PAPA! Your turn!&#148;

&#147;P-p-papa?&#148; Sakura stammers, looking about. Behind Power, she suddenly 
notices, a man in dark armor steps out. As he watches the armor stall 
in midair, beginning it&#146;s fall back down, he brings to bear a long 
rifle from his own tessaract jewel and motions to Power. &#147;Stop it just 
so above the ground please.&#148;

&#147;Ok.&#148; she nods, quickly bringing the mech to a halt in the air above 
just within reach of the two.

&#147;She could do that???&#148; Sakura gasped, realizing just now the extent of 
Power&#146;s power.

As they watched, the armored male puts the rifle&#146;s tip against the 
mech&#146;s faceplate and waves at the armor, &#147;Bye now.&#148;

BAM!

Sakura&#146;s jaw drops open. Tomoyo stands there stunned. As the two watch 
he motions for Power to toss the mech armor aside, leaving it and it&#146;s 
now dead pilot for someone else to clean up. As he motions for her to 
follow him, Sakura bolts forward towards her. &#147;WAIT! YOU MONSTER!! 
WHY---&#148;

Power, shocked by Sakura&#146;s appearance, lashes out knocking Sakura back 
with a jolt of psionics, sending her flying into Tomoyo knocking the 
two of them down.

&#147;Power!&#148; Technocrat calls out, coming to rest near her, &#147;Don&#146;t panic 
like that. You could have hurt someone.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry---&#148; she sighs, looking back at Sakura, &#147;She&#146;s dangerous, 
papa.&#148;

&#147;Power, wait! You shouldn&#146;t be with---&#148;

&#147;SHE&#146;S DANGEROUS!&#148; Power screams, clinging onto Technocrat&#146;s shoulder 
allowing him to hoist her up in the air. Just then, Nina &amp; Keiko (who 
were eating lunch with the other girls) show up. As the two sides 
stare at each other, Power nudges the armored male. &#147;Let&#146;s just go.&#148;

&#147;Right---&#148; he agrees, stepping backwards from everyone. Sakura, legs 
abit wobbly, stands up and tries to walk towards Power again. &#147;Power, 
wait! Come back with me! You don&#146;t want to stay with---&#148;

&#147;LEAVE PAPA ALONE!&#148; she cries out, &#147;IF YOU TRY TO TAKE ME AWAY FROM 
PAPA I&#146;LL KILL YOU!!&#148;

Sakura stops dead in her tracks, her face frozen. &#147;---kill---&#148;

&#147;LEAVE US ALONE!! LEAVE PAPA AND MAMA ALONE!! DON&#146;T YOU DARE HARM 
THEM!! NEVER!!&#148; she cries, as the two teleport away.

Sakura, dumbfounded and confused, collapses on the ground. &#147;---kill 
me---&#148;

Tomoyo holds onto Sakura, comforting her after her second big shock in 
one week.

In the background, Fight watches. &#147;I knew it was a mistake.&#148; she 
sighed, leaning against the tree. Suddenly a voice calls out and a 
hand tugs on her shirt. &#147;Miss?&#148;

Fight turns and smiles, tapping her young charge on her head as she 
motioned back to the class. &#147;Nothing. Let&#146;s go.&#148;

During vacation, Mirra&#146;s class was taking excursions to the sights of 
Tokyo from time to time, and their new P.E. teacher today was subbing 
on the field trip. As Fight drew near, she wondered if Mirra felt 
her--- only to smile. &#145;She&#146;s more interested in her love life than 
me.&#146; she thinks, watching Mirra &amp; Hikaru hold hands as they followed 
her through the zoo. &#145;Just as well. Even with my disguise I can&#146;t hide 
my presence from her forever--- still, it&#146;s a nice thought.&#146;

As they go on, Fight briefly thinks about Power, and lets it go.

&#145;Guess I&#146;m not the only one with a lifestyle that mistress disapproves 
of.&#146;

------

Nina called up for data on the assassin Technocrat and came up with 
the following.

TECHNOCRAT

Raven Guild

Technology enhanced and skilled with cybernetic and technological 
killing tools

Last updated 8-14-02

&#147;Version 2.0?&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s find out about that, Tomoyo.&#148; Nina responds as she pulls up the 
data. &#147;Now, before, Quake looked like this---&#148;

The image of a huge male in battle armor comes up.

QUAKE

Raven Guild

Special Ability - Ability to manipulate &#147;terra&#148; in general vicinity.

Presently partnered with Technocrat (original)

See Version 2.0 for update (8-14-02)

&#147;That means he can manipulate the earth beneath him.&#148; Nina points out, 
pointing at a line in the text. &#147;We know that!&#148; Keiko rebuffs, &#147;What&#146;s 
the new Quake look like? And this time how about a nude pic so we can 
become totally disgusted at his murdering loathsome male body.&#148;

&#147;Gee, aren&#146;t you just a well adjusted individual with males.&#148; Nina 
sighs.

Sakura, still shellshocked, just sat there, cradled in Tomoyo&#146;s arms 
as they watched.

&#147;OK. One completely embarrassing picture of Quake 2.0 in the buff 
coming---&#148; (she stops)

QUAKE 2.0

Sex change to Amazonian (8-14-02)

&#147;----&#148;

Everyone just stood there, staring. And staring. And--- Keiko grabs 
her face and screams, &#147;AGH!! THAT&#146;S HORRIBLE!! IT&#146;S EVIL!!&#148;

&#147;Eliza&#146;s is much bigger.&#148; Nina scoffs, turning the image off.

&#147;OH YOU WOULD SAY THAT!!!&#148; Keiko screams, making Sakura cringe and 
hold Tomoyo tighter, &#147;THAT&#146;S SICK!! YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?!?&#148;

&#147;That Quake is the girl in the relationship?&#148;

&#147;-----&#148; (silence) &#147;---you make me want to go back to my sake 
addiction--- you know that.&#148;

&#147;You had a sake addiction?&#148; Nina coyly responded, rolling her eyes.

&#147;You know I did! (After November how couldn&#146;t you!)&#148; Keiko huffed, 
storming out.

&#147;Well that was fun.&#148; Nina sighs, turning back at Sakura. &#147;I always 
thought Technocrat was that kind, but I guess he was more bi-sexual 
than I gave him credit for. Say, Sakura, what do---&#148;

Sakura was crying in Tomoyo&#146;s arms. Nina smiles, and moves forward to 
comfort Sakura.

&#147;I know, I know.&#148; Nina sighs, wrapping her arm around Sakura. &#147;It must 
be an enormous shock to find Power has fallen for those two. Wanting 
to be the daughter of two assassins must be painful, and how she 
threatened you. But I&#146;m here for you!&#148; (Nina leans forward) &#147;Anything 
you want to talk about! Anything at all! I&#146;m here for you!&#148;

Sakura, red faced and teary, looked up at Nina and she began to mouth 
a few words before going back to crying on Tomoyo&#146;s shoulder.

Nina walks out of the room in a huff.

&#147;Goddamn fascist bigot fixation on Eliza&#146;s Amazonian gender! She 
doesn&#146;t see me go all bitchy and crying everytime I think of Tomoyo 
wearing a strap on does she?!? Same thing after all!&#148;
