fanfiction by <a href="../authors/masoko.html">Masoko-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was a crisp and windy day. Our gang were trying to finish their 
class work. They needed to get it done before the big festival 
tonight. &quot;Sakura, is your costume finished yet?&quot; asked a worried 
Tomoyo. 

&quot;Yes, and its the best one I done so far.&quot; replied a cheerful Sakura. 
&quot;I would love to see you in it.&quot; Tomoyo stated thoughfully. 

&quot;You&#39;ll see it tonight.&quot; Sakura commented. &quot;By the way, how&#39;s your 
costume coming along?&quot; She asked trying stop Tomoyo&#39;s questions.

&quot;It&#39;s perfect for tonight.&quot; Tomoyo answered then asked, &quot;Have you seen 
Mei-lin and Li?&quot; &quot;No, haven&#39;t seen the lovely couple since lunch.&quot; 
&quot;You don&#39;t think they ran off and got married?&quot; asked Sakura jokingly. 

&quot;No, Li&#39;s not the type to do that even with Mei-lin.&quot; Then Tomoyo 
said, &quot;Then again, Mei-lin might have snatched him away last night.&quot; 
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t put it past her.&quot; Sakura agreed with a half smile.

&quot;We better stop this giggling or we&#39;re never getting through with our 
work.&quot; Tomoy suggested trying to reconcentrate on her work. &quot;Sure after 
I get that crazy thought of Li and Mei-lin out of my head.&quot; Sakura got 
out finally between gigles. 

Unknown to them however, Mei-lin was right behind Sakura when she said 
that. &quot;And what may I ask are you talking about Sakura? &quot;I&#39;ll have you 
know me and Li are destined to be together.&quot; Mei-lin practically 
screamed at first, but remembered where she was. 

&quot;Sorry Mei-lin, its just that you were gone all day and ...&quot; &quot;It was a 
bad joke in bad taste.&quot; Tomoyo said finishing Sakura&#39;s apology. &quot;I&#39;m 
in a good mood so I do forgive you for now.&quot; growled the chinese girl 
with fury in her eyes. 

&quot;Truth is, Li just asked me to the festival.&quot; Mei-lin said with a 
twinkle in her eye. &quot;I hope you two find dates in time, you know you 
still have 18 hours.&quot; The chinese woman smirked with that last 
sarcastic remark before leaving.

&quot;Huh, shows what she knows, you are my date Sakura.&quot; &quot;NOOO... You&#39;re 
my date remember, I asked you this time sweetie.&quot; &quot;So you did my 
angel&quot;

And with no hesitation at all she leaned in for a long and passionate 
kiss.
