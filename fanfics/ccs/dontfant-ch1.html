*_____* = thoughts
(______) = author&#146;s note

Note: I know, you&#146;re thinking &#145;What&#146;s with all the notes?!?!&#146; but I 
need to clear this up before anything happens. I know that across from 
Tomoyo&#146;s bed, there is not a TV or a VCR, there is a couch thingy (I 
checked it out on my DVD) but, let&#146;s just pretend that there&#146;s a big 
screen, shall we?

------------------------------------------------------------

 *Finished!* Tomoyo lifted her latest sketch of Sakura up to the lamp 
light on her desk and admired it, noticing a few curves she might want 
to edit later. She eyed it a bit and set it back down, tapping her 
pencil against her shoulder, it was one of her few drawings in which 
Sakura wasn&#146;t wearing one of her costumes. Sakura&#146;s stance was normal, 
just smiling, waving at the looker, she wore her usual fuku uniform 
too&#133;normal for high school that is. *Now&#133;I think I&#146;ll..*

 Carefully, Tomoyo added a few words next to the picture of Sakura: 

 I love you!

 Tomoyo squinted and erased the exclamation mark, then she put:

 I love you..

 Frustrated, Tomoyo sat her pencil down. *In one, she&#146;s cheerful and 
in the other, she just doesn&#146;t seem to be..* She glanced about her 
former-organized desktop to see the sketches of Sakura in costumes, 
each costume just a little more revealing than the last. *I never 
thought I&#146;d want her this bad, it&#146;s getting out of hand. Before I know 
it, I&#146;ll be drawing her in her birthday costume..* Before Tomoyo could 
get a mental picture, she shook her head and flipped the picture over. 
*This _has_ to stop before she figures it out..*

 Tomoyo glanced over at her clock, Sakura was supposed to be there in 
about ten minutes&#133;She sighed and gathered her papers together, placing 
them into a drawer. *Do I look okay?* She felt her hair and then took 
out a brush from another drawer of her desk, pulling it through her 
long black hair.

 Knock knock! Tomoyo turned to her door and heard a body guard say, 
&quot;Daidouji-san, Kinomoto-san is here.&quot; The door opened and Sakura 
practically bounced into the room, as cheerful as ever. &quot;Tomo-chan!&quot; 
The bodyguard closed the door as Sakura gave her best friend a huge 
bear hug. &quot;Eek!&quot; Tomoyo squeaked as her shoulders were pressed 
together and she dropped the brush but she smiled, happy to see the 
other girl. &quot;Hi.&quot; She rose an eyebrow, noticing Sakura was already in 
her Pj&#146;s. Tomoyo still wore her school uniform.

 Sakura pulled away from her friend and pulled a few videos out from 
her little backpack, Tomoyo grinned. &quot;What? More of your hentai?&quot; She 
was smacked and Sakura sat the tapes down on Tomoyo&#146;s bed, she said, 
&quot;They&#146;re some of my father&#146;s old romance movies, I found them in the 
basement.&quot; Tomoyo shrugged, &quot;Love movies..hentai..what&#146;s the 
difference?&quot; She was answered by another smack.

 Since they had grown older (five years) , it only made sense that 
they would have changed a little. Tomoyo had begun to tease Sakura 
once in a while and also got taller than the emerald-eyed girl, 
while..well, the only thing that changed about Sakura was the length 
of her hair, it was just a little longer. She had it in her loose 
ponytail but her bangs were still there. (If you&#146;ve seen Rikku, you 
know what I mean.) 

 &quot;The &#145;difference&#146; is--no..I won&#146;t say it, not to your virgin ears.&quot; 
Sakura stopped herself before she went a little too far. *That would 
probably insult her.* Tomoyo knew what it would&#146;ve been, she decided 
to give Sakura a break and she said, &quot;Well, since you&#146;re in _your_ 
pj&#146;s, I guess I&#146;ll do the same. Pop in a movie?&quot; She nodded and Tomoyo 
took a small bunch of clothing out of her closet and headed to the 
bathroom to change.

 While in there, Tomoyo changed into her navy blue pj&#146;s and brushed 
her teeth, trying not be a little nervous. Love movies? Now really..if 
she was lucky, they&#146;d just watch them and poke fun at the characters. 
If not..well, Tomoyo didn&#146;t know what else could really happen. *Oh 
well.* After a few minutes, Tomoyo popped out of the room and tossed 
her clothing in the hamper on the way to her bed. Sakura smiled from 
under the sheets, she already had a movie in and she had the remote 
too. *This is way-y-y weird, if she&#146;s trying to hint at something, she 
needs to learn the meaning of the word &#145;tact&#146;. If not, then she&#146;s 
askin&#146; for it..* With a light smile, Tomoyo lifted up the covers and 
slipped under them, she asked, &quot;Why don&#146;t you push &#145;play&#146; now?&quot;

 &quot;Okay!&quot; Sakura cheerfully replied, pressing the &#145;play&#146; button on the 
little remote. In a quick movement, she scooted a couple feet closer 
to the other girl and nuzzled against her. Tomoyo looked down as 
Sakura explained her actions, &quot;It&#146;s just been a while since we did 
anything like this. Well..you know, you&#146;re always busy with choir and 
your photography classes and me with..&quot; She was silenced by the 
understanding gaze Tomoyo gave her. The girl beside her was glad that 
they hadn&#146;t drifted too far, she knew they would eventually patch 
things up and they would get closer together like they usually did, 
but how much closer could they get? Where was the line Sakura would 
most likely draw between them? Was there a line?

 Tomoyo sighed and tried to get a little more comfortable, Sakura 
stopped her nuzzling and settled for resting her head on the taller 
girl&#146;s shoulder. The movie eventually started, it was some horrible 
dubbed version of an American movie, called &#145;When in Rome&#146;. The actual 
purpose for watching it was beyond Tomoyo, it wasn&#146;t even the right 
kind of love. *Leave it to the Americans to make something 
so..predictable and bland in the department of emotions, they know 
barely anything about the kind of feelings I have for my dearest 
Sakura..not that that could ever be written down or acted out. I can&#146;t 
even describe it..* She peeked at Sakura, who just so happened to be 
grinning from ear to ear, it looked like it was going to be the kind 
of movie to make fun of. Out of the blue, Sakura pointed out, &quot;Two 
people don&#146;t just fall in love like that!&quot; 

 Tomoyo agreed and then Sakura moved away from her, she asked, &quot;Ooh, 
let&#146;s change the movie. I also got a copy of &#145;Balto&#146;.&quot; *Balto? Oh 
well...I guess we&#146;re just going to be watching movies here in bed all 
night.* Tomoyo got a smug look, maybe Sakura would fall asleep on her? 
Sakura noticed and correctly guessed what Tomoyo was thinking about, 
she said, &quot;Hey Tomo-chan, I wanna ask you about something. Can you 
guess what it is?&quot; She tilted her head to the side in question and 
Tomoyo gulped, she barely squeaked out her answer. &quot;Love?&quot; Sakura 
bonked her on the head lightly with her fist and giggled, she replied, 
&quot;No, I was going to ask you if I snore or not!&quot; 

 Tomoyo almost fell over on the bed but she regained her stature and 
said, &quot;No, Sakura-chan, you do not snore at all..just a few light 
sounds here and there, but I think it&#146;s cute.&quot; As usual, one of 
Tomoyo&#146;s comments made Sakura blush. &quot;What made you think I wanted to 
talk about love? It was the movie, wasn&#146;t it? Yeah&#133;.kinda made me do 
the same, almost.&quot; Sakura paused and turned away, then pasted on her 
best smile, lightly smacking Tomoyo in the shoulder. &quot;This movie is 
the best! It&#146;s funny, a little romantic, and..there&#146;s tons of action. 
You&#146;ll love it.&quot; 

 The two girls wouldn&#146;t let the rest of the night be ruined by awkward 
silences, they carried on as if nothing had happened..well, nothing 
really did anyways so why even talk about it? *It was Tomoyo being all 
weird as usual, that&#145;s probably what she&#146;s thinking.* 

 Before she even realized it, Tomoyo was nodding off, Sakura gave her 
a sideways glance and smiled a bit. *She can&#146;t handle these hours&#133;not 
like me, being a card captor made it so I was awake past midnight 
sometimes. Oh well, I&#146;ll just turn the movie off and hop back into bed 
next to her.* Sakura slowly inched off the bed and turned the TV off, 
squeaking because then she found herself in near total darkness. *Eek! 
I gotta feel my way back to the bed!* In the dark, she waved her hands 
about to try and find the bed, hoping she wouldn&#146;t trip over anything. 

 No, she did not &#145;accidentally&#146; fall onto Tomoyo, instead, Sakura made 
it back to the bed safely and barely touched her cousin as she settled 
in under the sheets. She looked out the window to her right at the 
full moon and then shifted to see Tomoyo, completely out like a light. 
*So much for my plan...* Sakura sighed and turned over, grabbing a 
fistful of comforter to snuggle up with.

 Sakura laid there for a bit until she realized that she just plain 
wouldn&#146;t be able to fall asleep, something was keeping her awake and 
she couldn&#146;t figure out what. *Maybe it&#146;s a nagging feeling..let&#146;s 
see..I turned the stove off at home..I hid the strawberry cheesecake 
from Kero..nope, I haven&#146;t forgotten anything.* When she finally 
figured out just what was hindering her from sleep, she decided to 
tire herself out somehow. *I bet Tomoyo, all her maids and body 
guards, can&#146;t clean this entire house..mansion, there must be 
something I can do..*

 And so, Sakura started out on her ridiculous quest to do something to 
pass the time until she felt like going back to bed. *Oh come on, 
don&#146;t tell me _all_ of the trash has been taken out?!* She stood in 
the middle of a hallway and glanced from side to side, it was 
ludicrous. Sakura finally found her target in the kitchen downstairs. 
There, the trash can was full. Satisfied, the girl dropped to her 
knees on the tile. 

 Just then, the lights clicked on and Tomoyo&#146;s mother walked in. At 
first, she just stood watching in wonder, then she asked in a calm 
voice, &quot;Now, Sakura, I hope that my girl isn&#146;t keeping you awake, is 
she?&quot; Sakura shot up from her position and bowed several times. &quot;No, 
no! It&#146;s just me, Daidouji-san..I can&#146;t sleep right now..and..I didn&#146;t 
know you were here, I thought you were off in America on a business 
trip.&quot; Sonomi nodded, guessing just what was bothering Sakura..after 
all, she was almost the same age when she..((No! I&#145;m not talking about 
that!!)) Sonomi placed a hand on Sakura&#146;s shoulder and walked her to 
the staircase, she said, &quot;Off to bed with you. She&#146;s waiting.&quot;

 Before Sakura could say or ask anything, Sonomi walked away and 
disappeared further into the house. *Guess that was pretty stupid of 
me..oh well, at least I&#146;m not as hyper as before.* Up the stairs and 
into Tomoyo&#146;s bedroom she went, stopping herself before she collapsed 
on Tomoyo&#146;s bed as not to wake up the other girl. Instead, she slowly 
crawled under the sheets and settled down with a sigh. She jumped when 
Tomoyo asked, &quot;Did you go down to the kitchen for something?&quot; Sakura 
winced and whispered, &quot;Yeah..I did.&quot; 

 Silence reigned over the two of them for a bit, each thinking that 
the other was sleeping. Spontaneous as Sakura sometimes was, she 
rolled over and rested her head on Tomoyo&#146;s shoulder. *KAMI-SAMA?!* 
Tomoyo almost pushed her away but instead she froze in place, not able 
to move, barely remembering to breathe. *What do I..? Why did..? Is 
she..did she mean to...does she..?!*  Sakura looked up at her shocked 
friend and asked, almost hurt, &quot;Daijoubu ka, Tomo-chan?&quot; She was 
awake?! Tomoyo mouthed words but nothing came out, as if to squeeze 
out an answer, Sakura nuzzled her friend. &quot;I-I..was just shocked 
that&#146;s all.&quot; That was all she said, Sakura innocently replied, &quot;Oh 
come on, like we haven&#146;t hugged before? This is the kind of thing best 
friends do all the time!&quot;

 Ooh, arrow to the heart! Tomoyo painfully smiled and closed her eyes 
to hide the pain, Sakura just had to remind her of her title. The 
title that truly drew the line; best friend. Yes, there must have been 
a line, after all.. could best friends love each other? *That&#146;s silly, 
I know Sakura loves me. But she doesn&#146;t love love me..whatever that 
means.* No commitment, nothing to stop Sakura from falling in love 
with some guy..that was a part of the meaning Tomoyo derived from 
those words, the other part was on her side. &#145;Friend&#146; meant that the 
girl beside her would never be &#145;in&#146; love with her, never feel 
enthralled by her. There she was, right there...Tomoyo could lift a 
hand and touch Sakura but that was a forbidden gesture, she was just a 
&#145;best friend&#146;, what right did she have to alter that? *None.* 


(End of night)


 Morning slowly came to be, rays of sunlight shot above Tomoyo&#146;s 
curtains and into the room, missing the bed. Birds chirped in the 
background, chimes clanged against each other, it promised to be a 
perfectly normal morning. Sonomi was gone, she had left for the 
airport just hours before. Tomoyo was waking up from a perfect 
dream&#133;.one that she could never tell her best friend about, as she 
laid there, she realized that Sakura had turned over in her sleep and 
practically slept on the other side of the bed. *What? Did I push her 
away on accident or something?* Then it dawned on her, remembering the 
strangeness of the night before, Tomoyo silently recollected her 
emotional turmoil and sighed. 

 At that sound, Sakura&#146;s eyes snapped open and for a brief moment she 
didn&#146;t know where she was. *How did I end up on _this_ side of the 
bed? Oh well&#133;* She turned over and her eyes met those of Tomoyo&#146;s and 
Sakura smiled. &quot;Hey, love.&quot; Tomoyo painfully smiled, giving up 
questioning Sakura&#146;s behavior, she&#146;d just have to go along with it 
until the other girl reverted back to her normal self. &quot;Hi..&quot; She had 
to stop herself from laughing at Sakura when she saw her hair, it was 
all messed up but the girl still managed to be just as cute and 
adorable as ever. &quot;Wha&#133;?&quot; Sakura felt her head and smiled, then she 
asked, &quot;Do you have a brush I can use?&quot; 

 Tomoyo thought a bit and nodded, pointing to her desk, she still 
wasn&#146;t all there because of the early hours. How could she have known 
that she just pointed Sakura to her &#145;secret&#146; drawer with all of those 
sketches of her? Sakura didn&#146;t even notice that Tomoyo&#146;s brush was 
actually on the floor, right beside the bed&#133;..

 And so, fate had it that Sakura _would_ open the drawer with all of 
the papers in it. When Sakura gasped, Tomoyo realized just what she 
had done. *Oh, crap&#133;..* Sakura reached down and lifted the small pile 
of papers out of the drawer, still not saying a word. The top page was 
one with her wearing a rather skimpy costume. She looked at it 
sideways as Tomoyo continued to tense up. &quot;Sakura-chan&#133;.I&#133;um&#133;was 
just&#133;&quot; That was all she could say, she couldn&#146;t really give her a 
reason for drawing her&#133;except for love. *Now what? Instantaneous 
death?* Her mind was screaming at her, telling her to tear those 
papers away and run away to who-knows-where but she knew that Sakura 
was by far the better runner. *Damn&#133;*

 When Sakura took a look at the other pages, she began to frown, and 
then she got to the last page. The one with &#145;I love you..&#146; written on 
it, Sakura squinted and looked to Tomoyo for the first time in 
minutes. &quot;What is the meaning of this? Is this what you want from me 
or something?&quot; The other girl could only squeak but she tried to 
answer, &quot;I just..want..well&#133;if you don&#146;t&#133;eh&#133;&quot; Tomoyo noted just how 
cowardly she sounded and stopped trying to answer, Sakura was 
practically glaring at her. 

 Sakura huffed and calmly said, &quot;Don&#146;t fantasize about me.&quot; Then, she 
turned away from her and set the papers back into the drawer. Tomoyo 
was hurt, deep, Sakura hated how she felt, it was obvious now. Before 
Tomoyo could try and say anything more to justify her actions, Sakura 
headed towards the door. *I&#146;ve lost her now.* Her blood boiled, she 
felt like hitting herself like a hammer.

 But to her surprise, Sakura did not leave the room, it seemed as 
though she never meant to. Sakura turned around with a smile and said, 
&quot;I&#146;m right here, Tomo-chan.&quot; In an instant, Tomoyo&#146;s mood turned 
upside down. She had been forgiven? Tomoyo didn&#146;t fully understand 
just what Sakura meant, so the girl added, &quot;It&#146;s for real, I&#133;love you, 
Tomoyo. So, don&#146;t fantasize about me because I really do love you.&quot; 
Tomoyo&#146;s mouth fell open and she got out of the bed, but just then, 
Sakura charged her and they fell onto the bed together.</pre>
