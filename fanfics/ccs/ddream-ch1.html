<h1>Daydreaming</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chirino.html">Ricardo Chirino</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Every day is a new chance to reach happiness. When I&#39;m near
Sakura-chan, nothing can go wrong. She&#39;s my reason to live. Whenever I
see her lovely smile, my life is filled with joy. I&#39;m so lucky. I live
near an angel. I feel alive when we are together. Although this is not
really difficult. We were meant to be together. My dear Sakura-chan.

Every day, when I go to Tomoeda Gakuen I find Sakura there. She&#39;s
always smiling. She&#39;s always cheerful. God! I certainly can&#39;t even
think about my life without Sakura. I guess it&#39;s fate. My dear mother,
Sonomi, also had a crush on Nadeshiko. Definitely, our blood ties us
together. Today I&#39;m going to spend a long, long time with my sweet and
tender Sakura-chan. That&#39;s what I really want. That&#39;s what we both
want...

&quot;Tomoyo? Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

I felt the voice grow. It was getting me back to reality. Her lovely
voice was calling me from the void of my mind. Sakura-chan was calling
me.

&quot;Yes dear?&quot; I said as softly as possible to my beloved.

&quot;You were daydreaming, ne?&quot; Sakura asked me. She was stunning. So
beautiful and attractive. She was the captor of my heart and soul.
&quot;Class is over, you know...&quot;

&quot;Yes... I. I was thinking on you, Sakura-chan.&quot; I said, blushing.

&quot;Oh Tomoyo!&quot;

Sakura leaned against me. She was so close! I could feel her warm
breath, her soft skin, her angelic eyes staring at me. I was in
paradise. She used her hands and softly hugged me.

&quot;Tomoyo. You are so sweet.&quot;

I could feel her soft, baby-like smell. Her brown short hair was soft
and silky. I love how her cute head felt on my hands. I want to protect
Sakura. I want she to stay with me like that forever. Sakura-chan!

&quot;Sakura-chan. I love you with all my might.&quot;

&quot;I love you too, Tomoyo-chan. Just hug me, please.&quot;

We stayed like that for a long time. Chiharu entered the classroom to
pick the flower vase, and saw us together. She already knew about our
relation, and she smiled at the lovely sight.

&quot;See you tomorrow, Sakura, Tomoyo.&quot;

&quot;Bye, Chiharu-chan!&quot; we replied at the same time.

We were alone. It didn&#39;t matter. If the classroom was full it would be
the same. We were in love, and we could find happiness anywhere, as
long as we were together. I&#39;m in heaven whenever I&#39;m near my
Sakura-chan.

&quot;Tomoyo...&quot;

Sakura looked at me directly. Those beautiful green eyes of her
captivated me with each stare. God... She&#39;s so beautiful. I, without
noticing, following the desires of my body and my mind, leaned forward
to her. My lips only a few millimeters from hers. Now I could smell the
air coming out from her... I could feel the warmth of my beloved
Sakura-chan.

&quot;Please, kiss me... I want to love you.&quot; She said caringly to me.

I couldn&#39;t resist it anymore. My heart was galloping. I was so happy
and excited. I took the last step and placed my mouth on hers. We
kissed for a long, long time. We kissed and hugged like never before. I
can&#39;t describe how I felt at that moment. The feeling of joy and love
was overwhelming.

After a few minutes, we went outside. We leaned against a tree. The
sunset was beautiful. I don&#39;t know if it really was, but I guess that
being with that special person can make anything look gorgeous.

Sakura sat beside me. Her head rested on my shoulder.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan...&quot;

&quot;Yes, my love.&quot;

&quot;Can you sing for me?&quot;

&quot;Of course, my angel.&quot;

It was a pleasure for me to sing to her. I really enjoy singing to her.
God, I really love her! I&#39;ll do my best to make her happy, since her
happiness is mine too.

I sang for her a long time. Soon she fell asleep on my lap. I softly
caressed her hair. After a while she woke up, and we both went to my
house. There we spent the night together.

Tomorrow I&#39;ll be there for her! Tomorrow she&#39;ll be there for me...

&quot;Sakura-chan. I love you...&quot;
