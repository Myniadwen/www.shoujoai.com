me decide on a title for this. And for being the first person to post
one of my stories inspiring me to write more and start my own page. So
thanks Li Xiolang ^^

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Hoe!!! I&#39;m going to be late again.. Kero-chan why didn&#39;t you wake
me??&quot; Sakura shouted at Kero-chan frustrated as she grabbed her hat off
the back of the chair. She was out the door before Kero-chan even had a
chance to remind her that last time he tried to wake her up, he was
almost seriously injured by her.

&quot;Ohayou onii-san. Where&#39;s papa?&quot; Sakura asked as she shoveled her
breakfast into her mouth.

&quot;He left this morning for his business trip remember?&quot; Touya reminded
her trying not to piss her off this morning.

&quot;Oh..&quot; Sakura said sounding disappointed. &quot;Wah! I&#39;m going to be late.
I&#39;m supposed to be there early today.&quot; Sakura yelled towards Touya as
she rushed to put on her roller blades and took off towards school.
Sakura sighed as she skated towards school taking in the sight of the
flowers that are beginning to bloom now that spring has come again.

&quot;Yo! Sakura-chan. Chotto matte.&quot; Yukito yelled as he saw Sakura skating
in front of him. She turned around and slowed down waiting for him to
catch up. &quot;Ohayou, Sakura-chan.&quot; Yukito said smiling at Sakura. She
tried not to blush but failed and could only manage to mutter &quot;Ohayou,
Yukito-san&quot; back at him. Feeling shy around Yukito, Sakura couldn&#39;t
think of anything to talk about so she just decided to enjoy riding to
school with him.

As Sakura&#39;s school came into view she started saying goodbye to Yukito
and turned into her school where Tomoyo was waiting for her. She
stopped to watch as Yukito rode on towards his school and he turned
around throwing something at her. &quot;A present for you.&quot; He said as he
rode out of sight tossing a piece of candy to her. Sakura blushed again
and Tomoyo noticed.

&quot;He always has something for you doesn&#39;t he Sakura-chan.&quot; Tomoyo said as
she watched Sakura blush even more. &quot;Come on now, we can&#39;t be late to
class.&quot;

&quot;Hai!&quot; Sakura shouted for no reason. Taking Tomoyo&#39;s hand into her own
she took off towards class. Tomoyo just looked down at her hand that
was holding on to Sakura&#39;s reminding herself that Sakura is just to
young to understand. &quot;When your older. I&#39;ll tell you again so you can
understand...Just how much I love you Sakura-chan,&quot; she thought to
herself.

___________

During their break Tomoyo and Sakura sat outside watching as Meiling
chased Li-kun around trying to get him to be her boyfriend. The two
girls giggled as they discussed how persistent she is. &quot;Ne,
Tomoyo-chan. Would you like to come over after school? Papa-san is away
on a business trip and Touyo is going to Yukito&#39;s tonight to study so
I&#39;d be all alone and it&#39;d be nice to have your company for a while,&quot;
Sakura concluded looking at her best friend.

&quot;Of course!&quot; Tomoyo smiled at Sakura and sighed to herself. &quot;This
becomes more difficult every day. Now I know how okaa-san felt when she
was in love with Sakura&#39;s mom. It is depressing when the other is
completely oblivious to your feelings.&quot;

Sakura noticed the change of expression on Tomoyo&#39;s face and asked her
if something is wrong. Tomoyo just forced a smile trying to convince
Sakura. &quot;Why don&#39;t we go help Li-kun get away from Meiling for a little
bit? All she does is chase him around. It must get tiring.&quot; Tomoyo
suggested trying to get her thoughts of Sakura out of her mind. Sakura
nodded and the two took off after Li-kun.

___________

&quot;Tadaima Kero-chan!&quot; Sakura shouted as she entered her home tugging
Tomoyo behind her. &quot;Eh, where&#39;s Kero-chan? He usually comes to the door
to greet me.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you say you have a fight with him the other night?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but I thought he got over it. Maybe he&#39;s just up in my room
sleeping or playing that new game he got.&quot; Tomoyo nodded at her friend
and they headed upstairs to Sakura&#39;s bedroom. As Sakura opened the door
and stepped inside her room her jaw dropped to the floor. &quot;KERO-CHAN,&quot;
Sakura said trying to keep her temper in check. &quot;What have you done to
my stuff?&quot; She asked looking at priceless contents of one of her desk
drawers. She noticed all the notes that Tomoyo had given her were
laying on the floor along with other keepsakes.

Tomoyo placed a hand on Sakura&#39;s shoulder calming her down and went to
pick the stuff up off the floor. She noticed that Sakura had kept the
notes from her and blushed slightly. &quot;Maybe there is hope,&quot; she thought
to herself. She decided to take a chance, and asked Sakura why she kept
all of them.

&quot;Because they are from my best friend and they are very important to
me. Just like you Tomoyo-chan,&quot; Sakura said giving Tomoyo a warm smile.

Tomoyo blushed again and looked at the desk. &quot;So where&#39;d all this stuff
come from?&quot; Sakura pointed at the drawer Kero-chan removed them from
and Tomoyo tapped on the drawer. &quot;It&#39;s safe to come out Kero-chan,&quot;
Tomoyo whispered.

Kero-chan poked his head out of the drawer and looked at Sakura. &quot;Gomen
nasai Sakura-chan. I only wanted to have some space for myself.&quot;

&quot;Daijoubu Kero-chan.&quot; Sakura said finally after calming down. Just ask
next time you do something like that, ne?&quot; Kero-chan nodded his
agreement and the trio went downstairs to fix something to eat.

As Sakura was preparing some food Tomoyo was videotaping Kero-chan and
finally turned the camera on Sakura. &quot;Aww.. Sakura your so cute when
you cook,&quot; Tomoyo said drawing Sakura&#39;s attention. When Sakura noticed
she was being taped a rather large sweat drop appeared on her head. &quot;If
only she knew how much I meant it.&quot;

&quot;Arigatou Tomoyo-chan,&quot; Sakura smiled at her friend and went back to
cooking. After their food was done the girls along with Kero-chan sat
down to eat and talked about school and their friends. Tomoyo finally
brought up how she thought Li-kun was starting to get a crush on Sakura
even though Meiling was after him.

&quot;Hontou?&quot; Sakura asked blushing. &quot;Do you really think he likes me?&quot;

Tomoyo only nodded that he does like her. Then she felt like kicking
herself for bringing it up. She felt herself slipping into a depression
over it. &quot;Can something really hurt so much? But I have to keep
torturing myself. Why???&quot; she thought silently. Sakura noticed the
change in Tomoyo&#39;s facial expressions and asked her friend if she was
alright.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot; Tomoyo tried to convince Sakura. It seemed her best
friend knew her better than she thought. Sakura still wasn&#39;t satisfied
though.

&quot;That&#39;s why I asked you here Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

&quot;Huh? I don&#39;t get it.&quot;

&quot;You seem...distant lately. Like there&#39;s something on your mind all the
time. And I just want you to know, if there&#39;s anything wrong, or
anything you need to talk about I&#39;m here for you.&quot; Sakura said smiling
gently at Tomoyo. &quot;Actually, why don&#39;t you stay here tonight? Tomorrow we
don&#39;t have school and we could go on that picnic we were supposed to have
a while ago.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Tomoyo asked not wanting to be a bother to anyone.
Sakura nodded at her friend and took one of Tomoyo&#39;s hands into hers.

&quot;Let&#39;s go shopping ne?&quot; Sakura suggested. They both cleaned up after
eating and decided to go out for a while.

___________

Once the girls returned from their shopping trip is was already dark
outside and they were both exhausted from their busy trip shopping. &quot;I
can&#39;t believe you spent a whole months allowance already Sakura-chan.
But that shirt will look so good on you.&quot; Tomoyo said complimenting
Sakura for the millionth time that day.

&quot;Why don&#39;t we go to bed now Tomoyo-chan? I&#39;m so exhausted.&quot; Sakura said
leading the two upstairs. When they entered the room they found
Kero-chan still playing his new game and yelling at the TV screen. They
both laughed at him getting his attention.

&quot;Did you two get me anything?&quot; He asked with a hopeful look in his
eyes.

&quot;Gomen ne Kero-chan. Not this time.&quot;

&quot;Oh well. I guess I&#39;ll just go to sleep then he said saving his game.

&quot;Ano.. Sakura-chan. I came here right after school so I don&#39;t have
anything to sleep in.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay Tomoyo-chan. You can wear something of mine.&quot; Sakura looked
through her clothes and found something that would be good for Tomoyo
to sleep in. After the two girls changed Tomoyo began to head
downstairs when she felt Sakura take hold of her hand. &quot;Its always when
she touches my hand that makes me hurt the most.&quot; Tomoyo thought
quickly.

&quot;Where are you going Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura asked her friend.

&quot;I was going to sleep on the couch.&quot;

Sakura just smiled at her for a moment. &quot;Baka, your sleeping in my room
with me.&quot; Sakura told her not giving Tomoyo much choice. &quot;Great. Being
that close to her. Watching her sleep. I wont sleep at all tonight.&quot;
Tomoyo only smiled and followed Sakura to her bedroom.

The two crawled into Sakura&#39;s bed and Kero-chan turned off the lights
after they were situated. &quot;O-yasumi&quot; He said to the two girls as he
laid down in his new bed in Sakura&#39;s desk drawer. As the two girls lie
there in the dark they talked until almost midnight. Sakura moved so
that she was now laying on her back and as she resituated herself her
hand brushed up against Tomoyo&#39;s. &quot;What is that weird feeling I just
got?&quot; she asked herself. Tomoyo had stopped talking and Sakura just
laid there not bothering to move her hand away from Tomoyo&#39;s.

As Tomoyo tried to think of anything in the world other than the fact
that Sakura&#39;s hand was touching her (and trying to remember to breathe)
Sakura was deep in thought. She was thinking about her relationship
with Tomoyo and all the things they had done together. She thought
about all the comments Tomoyo had given her. And then one incident
stuck out in her mind. &quot;I love you Sakura.&quot; then later. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you
when your older.&quot; Sakura thought as much as she could trying to figure
out what that meant.

Finally she figured it out. But could Tomoyo really like her..like
that? No, that&#39;s not the problem. She knew Tomoyo liked her. She just
pretended not to.. But the problem was..Did she like Tomoyo back? Yes.
she did. She loved Tomoyo too. &quot;Hoe. What am I going to do?&quot; Sakura
thought to herself. &quot;What do I do now? Do I tell Tomoyo I love her? No,
I wont tell her. Then what?&quot; Sakura&#39;s mind was whirling as she lay next
to Tomoyo frozen in place. &quot;That&#39;s it. I&#39;ll show her.&quot; she concluded.

Sakura moved her hand ever so slightly so that it was resting on top of
Tomoyo&#39;s. She held on to Tomoyo&#39;s hand and intertwined their fingers.
&quot;Sakura-chan?&quot; Sakura didn&#39;t say anything to Tomoyo leaving her best
friend full of questions. Sakura then rolled over wrapping one of her
arms around Tomoyo&#39;s waist and fell to sleep. Tomoyo, not daring to
move a muscle, was wondering what was going on here. &quot;Is this a joke?
Could it be, that she likes me? No, she&#39;d never feel like that. She&#39;s
to young to understand.&quot;

___________

When morning came Tomoyo&#39;s mind was still at work wondering why Sakura
was holding on to her so tightly. She hadn&#39;t slept one bit. Sakura woke
up in Tomoyo&#39;s arms and smiled to herself. She held on to Tomoyo a
little tighter letting Tomoyo know she was awake. Sakura looked up at
her friend innocently and asked, &quot;Sleep well?&quot;

Tomoyo could only mumble a few words that didn&#39;t make sense. &quot;Your so
cute Tomoyo-chan,&quot; Sakura smiled at her and got out of bed. &quot;Evil. She
is evil,&quot; Tomoyo thought. &quot;Tomoyo-chan, after we shower lets go on our
picnic, ne?&quot; Tomoyo could only nod at her friend, as she still lay
paralyzed.

A few hours passed and the girls had gotten dressed and they were just
finishing with packing their lunch. &quot;Today&#39;s the day. I&#39;ll tell
Tomoyo-chan how I feel today at our picnic.&quot; Sakura told herself. &quot;Are
you ready Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura asked and the two girls headed out the
door.

Ano..Kero-chan isn&#39;t coming Sakura?&quot; Tomoyo asked.

Sakura thought back to when Tomoyo was in the shower earlier and how
she bribed Kero-chan not to come along today. &quot;Onegai Kero-chan? I&#39;ll
make you a whole cake just for you if you just stay behind today.
There&#39;s something I have to tell Tomoyo and there can&#39;t be anyone
around when I tell her.&quot; Sakura pleaded with the guardian beast.

&quot;What do you have to tell her?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll see soon enough. Just trust me.&quot;

&quot;Fine, but I get a whole cake tomorrow. All to myself.&quot; He demanded
crossing his arms.

&quot;Arigatou Kero-chan!&quot; Sakura exclaimed hugging him. Sakura laughed as
she was remembering the conversation and turned to Tomoyo. &quot;He said he
wanted to stay home and finish his new game today,&quot; Sakura informed her
friend. &quot;Well, you ready?&quot;

The girls headed to the park and Sakura&#39;s heart was racing. &quot;This isn&#39;t
going to be easy. I can&#39;t believe this. What if something goes wrong?
At least I know she wont reject me.&quot; Sakura&#39;s mind was going a mile a
minute and she couldn&#39;t wait to get to the park and get this off her
chest.

They found a nice spot under a tree to place their blanket and sat
down. Tomoyo began to unpack their lunch when she felt Sakura take hold
of her hand. Tomoyo stopped and looked at Sakura. &quot;What is it Sakura,
is something wrong? You look scared.&quot;

&quot;No nothings wrong,&quot; Sakura shook her head and continued. &quot;Its just,
there&#39;s something I have to tell you. You see, it&#39;s that, I...I..&quot;
Sakura paused, looking at Tomoyo&#39;s eager face. She was sure Tomoyo knew
what she was going to say but she was still scared to admit it out
loud.

&quot;Hey, Sakura have you seen Li-kun around here?&quot; Meiling shouted as she
saw two of her friends. &quot;Must kill,&quot; Sakura thought looking at Meiling
with an evil smile. &quot;What&#39;s with the evil look Sakura? Something
wrong?&quot; Meiling asked innocently.

&quot;I&#39;m trying to have a private conversation with Tomoyo at the moment.&quot;
Sakura retorted.

&quot;Oh? What about?&quot; Meiling was being persistent and was getting on
Sakura&#39;s nerves. &quot;Oh food, mind if I have some?&quot; she said already with
food in her hands almost to her mouth.

&quot;Meiling, could you please leave us. I need to talk to Tomoyo
privately.&quot; Sakura was on her last nerve and about to use one of her
clow cards to dispose of Meiling.

&quot;Tell me what&#39;s so important first.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Sakura crossed her arms over her chest.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Sakura now extremely pissed and losing her temper.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m trying to tell Tomoyo I love her okay? Now leave me alone and go
chase Li-kun. Do whatever you want. But let me tell Tomoyo I&#39;m in love
with her okay?&quot; Tomoyo and Meiling&#39;s jaws were dropped to the floor.
Meiling could practically see flames coming from Sakura&#39;s head and
decided to quickly make her exit.

&quot;Excuse me for a moment. I think I have to go umm.. Chase Syaoran for a
while or umm.. something.&quot; Meiling said as she ran from Sakura. Sakura
smiled proudly at herself for getting rid of Meiling and then frowned.
&quot;Great, it was supposed to be special when I told her I love her,&quot;
Sakura thought out loud.

Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo startled Sakura out of her thoughts. &quot;If you
really do mean that, it was very special just hearing you say it.&quot;

&quot;I did mean it Tomoyo-chan. I&#39;m in love with you, not Li-kun or
Yukito-san. Your the one who makes me feel special. Who&#39;s always trying
to make me happy. I&#39;m just sorry it took me so long to realize it. Last
night, when I was laying in bed...&quot; Sakura trailed off thinking how
nice it was to be laying with Tomoyo. &quot;Last night you held me in your
arms. I know you didn&#39;t sleep at all, and I&#39;m sorry for not telling you
sooner. I just needed to be sure. But when I was laying, listening to
your heart beat, feeling your arms around me. I felt happier than I had
ever been in all my life. I love you Tomoyo-chan.&quot; Sakura finished and
looked at her best friend. Tomoyo had tears in her eyes and Sakura
wiped them away.

Tomoyo tried to speak, but once again no words would come out. All she
could do was throw herself into Sakura&#39;s arms and hold on to her with
all her might. &quot;I love you Sakura. I always have&quot; Tomoyo said as she
released her hold on Sakura. She looked up at Sakura who was now crying
tears of joy. Tomoyo smiled at her and leaned in so she was only a few
inches from Sakura&#39;s face. &quot;I promise I&#39;ll make you happy Sakura-chan,&quot;
she said.

&quot;You already do silly.&quot; Sakura closed the distance between them and
kissed her friend on the lips. &quot;Now what do you say to eating all this
food you brought?&quot; Sakura suggested as they broke apart. Tomoyo smiled
and began to eat. After they finished the two spent the rest of the day
at the park. Sakura was leaning back against a tree holding Tomoyo in
her arms. Neither spoke much, but instead enjoyed the others warm
embrace and they both knew, nothing would ever be able to come between
them from now on.
