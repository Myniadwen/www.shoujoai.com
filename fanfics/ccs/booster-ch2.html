<h1>Clow Card Booster Pack (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/booster-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The phone rang once, then twice. Li gritted his teeth. He could *feel* 
the card &#150; where on earth was Sakura? Three times, then four. At last, 
he heard the sound of the phone being answered.

&quot;Sakura!&quot; he shouted, &quot;Where are you?&quot;

The answer sounded somewhat distracted. &quot;Li? Oh...eh...I&#39;m at 
Tomoyo&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;I can feel a presence, can&#39;t you?&quot; Li was frantic now &#150; he was sure 
there was a Clow Card to be caught. Why on earth wasn&#39;t Sakura 
reacting?

&quot;Uh...yeah, yeah, I can feel it,&quot; Li was sure he heard a little giggle 
from the Card Captor. &quot;But really, I&#39;ve got it under control.&quot;

&quot;Under control?&quot; Li yelped. &quot;Sakura &#150; are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Yes, really, Li, I&#39;ve...&quot; there was a pause as Sakura gasped 
slightly, a sound that sent shivers down Li&#39;s spine. &quot;I&#39;m okay &#150; 
really.&quot; There was another giggle and the sound of movement in the 
background.

&quot;Is Tomoyo there with you?&quot; 

&quot;Yeee...ah...&quot; her voice was distant again, she sounded almost 
drugged. &quot;Stop that!&quot;

Li stared at the phone. &quot;Stop what?&quot;

Another giggle. &quot;Not you, Syaoran. Really, I&#39;ve got it under...&quot; 
another gasp, almost a moan, &quot;control.&quot;

&quot;Sakura...&quot; Li began, but he was immediately cut off.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to go, but I&#39;ll call you later...&quot; There was another noise, 
the origin of which Li refused to contemplate, and Sakura came back on 
the line once again. &quot;Tomorrow morning. Late. I&#39;ll call you in the 
afternoon. Goodnight!&quot;

Li stared at the phone as a burst of new giggles spurted from the 
earpiece, followed by &quot;Oh, Tomoyo!&quot; and a click. He shook his head and 
tried hard not to think about anything.

 

&quot;Mmmm,&quot; Tomoyo moaned happily, as she rolled off Sakura&#39;s body. &quot;I 
think I like this card best so far.&quot; She smiled into her friend&#39;s 
eyes. 

Sakura looked up with a grin. &quot;It&#39;s not &#39;The Twin&#39;, that&#39;s for sure.&quot; 

They both laughed, and Sakura rolled over to pick the card up from the 
bedside table. The image was that of a stylized lily. She could feel 
Tomoyo&#39;s hand on her back as the dark-haired girl whispered its name 
into her ear, causing goosebumps to break out across her naked 
shoulders.

&quot;The Yuri Card,&quot; Tomoyo said.
