<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 5 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        Tomoyo walked beside Sakura, noticing the brown haired young 
woman&#39;s now slightly wide eyes. &#39;Wonder if I should have picked another 
restaurant?&#39; the black haired reporter mused worriedly. She had gotten 
used to the Rose, but Sakura was a newcomer....

        &quot;Here we are,&quot; the blonde haired waitress beamed. She set two 
leather bound menus on the table and added, &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a few 
minutes to get your orders.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks Becky,&quot; Tomoyo noted the girl&#39;s nametag with a smile.

        Sakura settled down into her seat, smiling slightly. &quot;An 
interesting restaurant,&quot; she noted. Sakura smiled slightly, &quot;I think 
it&#39;s the one Yukito and Toya go to, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

        &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Tomoyo agreed, &quot;but I was the one to tell them about 
it.&quot;

        Sakura nodded to herself thoughtfully. She looked over at 
Tomoyo, &quot;I guess you&#39;ve done a lot of research on me for your article, 
but I know almost nothing about you.&quot;

        Tomoyo flashed a smile, &quot;Not that much to tell.&quot;

        &quot;Oh really?&quot; Sakura asked.

        Tomoyo sighed to herself slightly, realizing that Sakura was 
serious. &quot;I was born here in Tokyo shortly before Sonomi Daidouji 
divorced her second husband,&quot; she said thoughtfully. &quot;Went to private 
schools for most of my life, probably why we never ran into each other 
in school. Against my mother&#39;s wishes I went into journalism,&quot; she 
smiled, &quot;my first real act of rebellion.&quot;

        Sakura smiled a little sadly, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have minded meeting 
you in school.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Tomoyo admitted. &quot;I had bodyguards all my life until 
I left school,&quot; she smiled wryly, &quot;I actually missed them for awhile.&quot;

        &quot;I read some of your articles after that interview,&quot; Sakura 
smiled, &quot;you&#39;ve done well. Several local journalism awards, in the 
running for some of the nationals.&quot;

        &quot;Still haven&#39;t won,&quot; Tomoyo grinned, &quot;but it&#39;ll happen.&quot;

        The waitress returned, a bounce to her step. &quot;Have you decided 
what you&#39;d like to order?&quot; Becky asked them cheerfully.

        &quot;What&#39;s the special tonight?&quot; Tomoyo asked smoothly.

        &quot;Burger platter,&quot; Becky said, &quot;with wedge fries, gravy, and 
drink.&quot;

        &quot;Totally unhealthy,&quot; Sakura noted with a smile, &quot;I&#39;d love it 
with as cola.&quot;

        Tomoyo chuckled softly, a little surprised by Sakura showing a 
decadent side. &quot;One for me, too, let&#39;s both be bad,&quot; she smiled, &quot;but 
make up two garden salads as a side dish, please.&quot;

        &quot;Got it,&quot; Becky waved as she scampered off.

        &quot;A bit of virtue to go along with all the vice,&quot; Sakura said 
with a impish little smile, &quot;it seems that we think alike.&quot;

        Tomoyo nodded, &quot;Guess so.&quot; She leaned back in her seat a bit, 
her long black hair flowing down her back in a neat braid as she studied 
Sakura.

        &#39;She seems so innocent at times,&#39; Tomoyo mused as she watched 
the elegantly dressed Sakura, &#39;but she adapted to all this easily.&#39; A 
young woman walked over, clearly having recognized the locally famous 
archeologist and Sakura handled her with gentleness and tact.

        &quot;What?&quot; Sakura asked curiously.

        &quot;How did you get into archeology?&quot; Tomoyo asked curiously.

        &quot;Wanting to understand the cards,&quot; Sakura admitted. &quot;From the 
stories my mother passed on they&#39;ve been around nearly forever....&quot;

        &quot;Here you go,&quot; Becky bounced up to their table, smoothly 
dropping off two heavily laden trays with the meals on them. She set 
those and the drinks in front of them before adding, &quot;I&#39;ll be by later 
to see if you want desert.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Sakura murmured, looking wide eyed at the massive 
amounts they had been served. Once Becky left she whispered, &quot;I can&#39;t 
eat all this!&quot;

        &quot;Join the club,&quot; Tomoyo laughed, &quot;but we&#39;ll make a valiant 
effort.&quot; As the two women dug in she asked, &quot;Have you had any luck 
looking into the cards?&quot;

        &quot;Not as much as I&#39;d like,&quot; Sakura admitted, taking a bite out of 
her burger then dabbing at her mouth with a napkin. &quot;Clow Reed was a 
magician who traveled across Asia, especially China and ancient Japan. 
He was also a fortune teller, and he originally fashioned the Clow cards 
to assist him in that,&quot; she explained.

        &quot;So how many cards are there?&quot; Tomoyo asked curiously, eating 
gravy covered fries with a great deal of enjoyment.

        &quot;A lot,&quot; Sakura sighed. &quot;I have the Windy and Fly cards and in 
my research I&#39;ve discovered that there are Mirror, Fight, Shadow and 
many others,&quot; she said.

        Tomoyo nodded slightly at that. &quot;So how would you go about 
finding all these cards?&quot; she asked her curiously.

        &quot;That&#39;s the problem,&quot; Sakura picked up a fry with her fingers, 
munching on it glumly. &quot;When I was searching in China I was able to... 
sense the presence of certain artifacts,&quot; she revealed, &quot;The book, pen 
and staff all drew me to them.&quot;

        &quot;So if you&#39;re near a Clow card,&quot; Tomoyo dug into her other half 
of a burger, &quot;you&#39;ll probably be able to sense it too.&quot;

        &quot;But only if I&#39;m pretty near,&quot; Sakura pointed out with a fry, &quot;I 
was only able to pick up the artifacts if I was within a few feet.&quot;

        &quot;So we&#39;ll need to find a lead on the cards locations first,&quot; 
Tomoyo mused. She smiled, &quot;My connections as a reporter might help.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Sakura flashed a smile, pushing her plate aside to 
get to her salad. She hesitated, &quot;I&#39;m not sure this sort of thing is 
going to be terribly newsworthy, though....&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;re family, sort of,&quot; Tomoyo finally said, referring to their 
mothers being cousins. She crunched on a tomato from her salad and 
chuckled softly, &quot;Besides, I don&#39;t think my curiosity would let me stay 
out of this, either.&quot;

        Sakura smiled, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

        &quot;I see you&#39;re pretty much done,&quot; Becky appeared with a smile. 
Tomoyo looked down at her plate in surprise, realizing that she&#39;d 
absentmindedly cleared her plate while talking to Sakura. &quot;What would 
you like for desert?&quot;

        Sakura looked appealingly at Tomoyo. &quot;I haven&#39;t been here 
before,&quot; she said, &quot;is there something you liked?&quot;

        &quot;There was a treat I got last time,&quot; Tomoyo smiled wickedly, 
&quot;Death by Chocolate.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not healthy, I take it,&quot; Sakura smiled back. She looked 
over up at where Becky stood, &quot;We&#39;ll take two, please.&quot;

        &quot;Two Death by Chocolate,&quot; Becky laughed, coming back in a few 
moments with two dishes filled with the seductive chocolate treat.

        &quot;You&#39;re a bad influence, you know that?&quot; Sakura said to Tomoyo 
with a laugh.

        &quot;Me?&quot; Tomoyo batted her eyes innocently. &quot;I wasn&#39;t the one who 
ordered it,&quot; she laughed, savoring a spoonful with a happy sigh.

        &quot;You know,&quot; Sakura said, a bit of chocolate stuck to the corner 
of her mouth, &quot;I had a really good time tonight.&quot;

        &quot;You sound surprised,&quot; Tomoyo noted.

        &quot;I guess I am,&quot; Sakura admitted. She blushed slightly, &quot;I don&#39;t 
have much of a social life.&quot;

        Tomoyo hesitated, reaching out to put her hand gently on top of 
Sakura&#39;s. &quot;Maybe I can help you change that,&quot; she offered.

        Sakura blushed, but she didn&#39;t pull her hand away. &quot;I&#39;d like 
that,&quot; she smiled.</pre>
