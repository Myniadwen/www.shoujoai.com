------------------------------------------------------------

Sakura and Tomoyo were sitting in their bedroom upstairs, planning 
Sakura&#146;s next battle costume. She had already tried on two costumes, 
and this was her third.

&quot;Tomo-chan----&#147; Sakura moaned softly, feeling the material in her 
hands as she did. &#147;Yes?&#147; Sakura sighs, tugging on the material abit, 
&#147;Are you sure this doesn&#39;t look silly Tomo-chan?&quot; Tomoyo smiled her 
usual gentle smile as she poked at the end of Sakura&#146;s lips to bring 
it up into a half-smile. &quot;I think you look just great Sakura-chan. You 
always look beautiful in those costumes.&quot;

&#147;If you say so.&#147; Sakura agrees reluctantly, blushing as she looks down 
at the shiny pink thing she was wearing. The material seemingly 
glistened in the room&#145;s lighting, and she looked rather--- well--- 
words failed Sakura at that moment. &quot;I can&#39;t sleep in this, though. 
And I don&#145;t think Nina will approve of me trying to capture a Clow 
card this late at night. She&#145;ll say I&#145;m stealing her &#147;beauty sleep&#147; 
from her.&quot;

Tomoyo giggled and began helping her out of her costume. &quot;And we can&#146;t 
have that, right? Alright. Go put your usual jammies&#146; on and crawl 
into bed for sleep--- that is, unless I get them off of you during the 
night for something other than sleep.&quot;

With that Sakura carefully removed the costume, allowing Tomoyo to 
fold it up while she went to put her usual comfy nightclothes on.

&quot;Are we still going to the New Years&#146; Dance on Saturday?&quot; she asked 
Sakura, who stuck her head into the shirt and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I 
thought Nina said it&#146;s evil to be conned into going to ANOTHER Misho 
NamoCatCat event?&quot; Tomoyo bit her lip when Sakura mentioned that name. 
She had to admit that Nina was probably right.

It&#146;s true. NamoCatCat had been leading Sakura-chan down a garden path 
for her own reasons lately. First time was when she staged that Field 
Day which turned into a good reason to get Sakura to seal &#147;Flower&#148; 
(and for Misho to reap the benefits and sell &#147;Flower&#148; Clow Card based 
merchandise after the event). The second time was with the Christmas 
talent show which seemingly didn&#146;t yield a Clow card appearance, but 
still made Misho a load of money. The third time was the trip to the 
zoo yesterday which yielded the Clow card Power, and the events that 
came from that--- (see Card Captor Sakura Remastered III Episode 5 for 
more details). This, hence, would be the fourth time Misho was doing 
something for Sakura&#146;s school (this time a dance to celebrate the end 
of 2002 that Friday) and Nina already was calling Misho the &#147;devil 
incarnate&#148; before NamoCatCat even thought of inviting her and Tomoyo 
to the dance.

Misho, of course, was appalled that Nina would blame her for Flower 
and Power&#146;s appearances and pointed at the Christmas talent show to 
prove her innocence, still Nina scoffed at the idea that there was 
anything remotely innocent about Misho&#146;s plots.

Still, there was a few Clow Card which would fit the theme of a dance, 
and maybe Misho was hoping one of them would show up and once again 
she&#146;d be on top of a major promotional booster with another Cardcaptor 
incident on her properties spiking up public interest in NamoCatCat 
Corp. holdings. And considering Sakura&#146;s experiences with both Fight 
and Power, she didn&#146;t want to have another card give Sakura the shock 
of her life.

With a slight sigh, Sakura stepped out of the closet and ran her hands 
up and down the soft material of her trusted jammies&#145;. &quot;Well... I was 
hoping this time it&#146;d be a legit event and not another reason for 
Misho to make me try to capture a Clow Card. Still, if it gets us 
closer to recapturing all the cards I guess I&#146;m all for it.&#147; Sakura 
sighed, looking up at Tomoyo. &quot;You don&#146;t think it&#146;s a trick, do you?&#147;

&#147;She&#146;s not like mother.&#148; Tomoyo said in a straightforward manner, 
&#147;Mother would never do that kind of thing to you---&#148; suddenly she 
grins at Sakura. &quot;And I much rather worry over what you&#146;ll wear to the 
dance rather than what Misho does at the dance. Think Mirra-chan is 
going to bring her lover to the dance? Maybe Toya will take her---&quot;

Sakura frowned at her. &quot;Stop teasing me.&quot; She remembers how she was 
supposed to, but never did, have a heart to heart with Toya about 
Mirra&#146;s &#147;infatuation&#148; with him. In the end it was the revelation that 
Mirra and her friend Hikaru were in love that ended any thoughts of 
Toya being her main crush. Still, Sakura almost had a heart attack on 
a few occasions thinking of what strange things her brother would have 
taught her!

The worst was the fear that one day she&#146;d walk in on Toya/Yuki, naked, 
teaching Mirra about sex! That thought alone gave Sakura fits and even 
made her cry once for no apparent reason. She was once with Mirra &amp; 
Tomoyo at the park (Hikaru was out of town for a day), Toya was 
working as a hot dog vendor (&#147;You work everywhere!&#148; Sakura groaned as 
she walked up to him to get some lunch for the three of them). Toya 
opened the cart and began the preps as Sakura shelled out her 
CreditChip, but quickly turned to tell her. &#147;Hey! Squirt! Cheer up! 
I&#145;ll make sure to give Hikaru my big one.&#148;

Sakura wouldn&#146;t stop crying for five whole minutes, she kept going on 
about how Toya was a beast and if he even touched Mirra that she&#146;d 
kill him.

Of course he meant this big hot dog brand that the cart carried, but 
she got carried away and imagined him in the woods screwing Mirra 
and--- she cried for 5 more minutes after that and swore that Toya was 
a horrible person to even say such a thing to her. Toya, of course, 
didn&#146;t understand what Sakura was going on about (and, in retrospect, 
most likely didn&#146;t want to know what Sakura was going on about 
either.)

&quot;What does Yuki see in him anyway---&#147; she muttered to herself, before 
noticing Tomoyo&#146;s watchful gaze on her. &#147;N-n-nothing!&#147;

&#147;Alright, Sakura-chan. But I&#39;m going to find out what you said 
eventually, so you might as well come clean! After all---&#148; (she jumps 
forward tackling Sakura into the bed and pins her down) &#147;You know you 
never could keep a secret from me.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; Sakura sighed, enjoying being pinned 
beneath Tomoyo-chan. Her lips quivering as she thought briefly of 
clamping her mouth down on one of Tomoyo&#145;s beautiful perfect--- &quot;Fine, 
don&#39;t tell me.&quot; Tomoyo giggled, rolling off of Sakura much to her 
disappointment. Sakura rolled her head sideways, and smiled at Tomoyo. 
&#147;I want to go to the dance with you. Even if it means jumping through 
Misho&#146;s hoops, I wouldn&#146;t miss it for the world.&#147;

Tomoyo quickly turned off the light and crawled into bed with her. 
&quot;Good night Sakura.&quot; She sighed, pulling the brown haired girl into 
her arms.

&quot;Good night Tomo-chan.&quot; Sakura yawned, sleep overtaking her.

-------

Looking at the clock beside the bed she saw it was 1:14 in the 
morning.

She glanced next to her at Tomoyo, but her beloved wasn&#39;t in bed.

A horrible feeling of dread came over Sakura as she quickly jumped out 
of bed, and rushed to the closet where she found--- nothing. &quot;She must 
be doing it again.&#147; Sakura sighed, relenting to Tomoyo&#146;s ways.

It seemed from time to time Tomoyo suffered from bad night visions, 
and she would crawl out of bed and leave the room as not to wake 
Sakura. Still, Sakura wished Tomoyo was there so she could comfort her 
and assure her that everything would be alright. Sakura stifled a 
yawn, looking about the room as her eyes adjusted to the dim light, 
before noticing how dry her mouth was. Slipping out of the room, she 
walked down the hall towards her private kitchen. On the way she heard 
an odd sound from one of the doors. It sounded like Tomoyo, but she 
wasn&#145;t certain. She blushed, thinking she might end up walking on an 
amorous Umi (Water) &amp; Gaia (Woods) making love by accident.

She stopped and looked around nervously, noticing a light on under the 
upstairs bathroom door and coming through the key hole.

Tomoyo&#39;s house was gigantic in comparison to Sakura&#146;s old home, and 
had more than one bathroom, this being one of them. Sakura heard 
another low moan from the door, and her worst fears finally overrode 
her desire to give Tomoyo her privacy as she quickly bolted into the 
room in a panic. Tomoyo nearly jumped off the seat as Sakura came 
barreling in, her hand frozen between her legs where she was---

&#147;Tomo-chan!!&#148; Sakura whined, looking at her lover severely, causing 
Tomoyo to blush a deep shade of red from embarrassment. Quickly Sakura 
dropped down to her knees without another word, and pushing Tomoyo&#146;s 
hand aside she leaned in and began to please her lovingly. Minutes 
passed as soon she began to notice that her own legs had gotten a bit 
wobbly and warm while working on Tomoyo, and she was glad she was 
knelt down or she would probably had fallen over by now. She held her 
breath as she brought Tomoyo to the pinnacle of climax, her teeth 
biting her lower lip as she let out a very loud and sharp cry dropping 
her body as she fell from her lofty climb towards release. Her body 
seemingly dropped onto Sakura, her arms automatically wrapping around 
her back as she moaned. Sakura, accommodating her, laid down as Tomoyo 
slowly floated down to terra firma again.

Sakura rolled her over, taking her in her strong grasp to hold her 
tight. Tomoyo, weak as a kitten, could only hold on as Sakura took 
her--- to the kitchen?

There, Sakura covered Tomoyo&#146;s nude bottom with the spare blanket 
hidden in the kitchen for &#147;cuddle&#148; times, and poured herself a soda. 
&#147;I feel a bit guilty for barging in on you like that, Tomoyo-chan--- 
in such an intimate moment.&#148; (her lips pull up in a smile as she takes 
a slow drawl on her drink, &#147;I&#146;m jealous!&#148;

Sakura leaned over, smiling as Tomoyo blushed at the attention. &#147;I 
was--- I was looking at this when I was--- I&#146;m sorry---&#147;

The picture was of Sakura, of course, dressed in the cat costume 
Tomoyo had made for her for Halloween a few days ago. She remembered 
how Nina teased her about the costume, calling Sakura something she 
probably would never repeat in public, yet it was still humorous 
anyway as the two laughed abit and talked about the halloween antics 
and all the trouble Nina got into trying to trick people into giving 
her candy twice. After a few minutes Tomoyo also drew a glass of soda, 
drank it with Sakura, and the two retired back to bed.

------

She was under the covers fast and had her eyes closed just as Tomoyo 
returned from washing up (and putting the blanket Sakura used for her 
back where it was). Tomoyo slid into bed, her arm curling around 
Sakura as she laid her head down to sleep.

Sakura felt a little nervous, still blushing from her forced entrance 
in on Tomoyo&#146;s private moment (fearing the worst), but Tomoyo didn&#146;t 
seem bothered by it in the least. Suddenly she felt Tomoyo&#146;s hand on 
her shoulder and felt warm breath on her cheek as Tomoyo leaned over 
her and whispered, &quot;No matter what happens, I love you Sakura-chan. 
One day I&#146;ll tell you my fears--- be patient, please, Sakura-chan--- 
please. I will always love you, nothing will ever stop that...&quot; 
something warm and wet dripped onto Sakura&#39;s cheek and Tomoyo rolled 
back over to go to sleep.

Sakura wasn&#39;t sure what she wanted to do. A part of her wanted to 
comfort her beloved, tell her that everything was going to be alright. 
But another, more immediate, part of her was frozen stiff in fear. She 
wanted to give Tomoyo her space, and patiently wait for her to confide 
in her as to what she was so fearful of that it&#146;d leave her shaking 
and crying in the night as she tried to sleep.

How could she miss something like that, a fear that gripped her 
beloved, and not yet be able to see it? How could she love Tomoyo yet 
not see the pain she was in? She quickly peered about the darkened 
room looking as if in vain for specters or Darklings that might be the 
root cause of Tomoyo&#146;s fears, only to find nothing beyond their bed 
which posed a threat to the young dark haired woman.

As Sakura peeked around at the dark room, she became more and more 
convinced that it was something similar to Shadow/Fear which was 
making Tomoyo scared. She remembered the incident with Shadow/Fear 
from a few months ago and how the two cards, working in unison, did 
terrible things to her (making her believe that Tomoyo was a rotting 
walking corpse right in front of her eyes).

Still, as her eyes roamed the room for any sign of an external agent 
that might have been causing Tomoyo&#146;s fears, she came up with nothing. 
Sakura couldn&#39;t see much in the dim lighting, but everything in it was 
all too familiar. The walls were covered with pictures of her and 
Tomoyo together (and some pictures, hidden in a drawer, were of each 
of them in intimate poses, taken by the other in their happiest 
moments). The desk itself was spilling over with drawings of either 
the costumes Tomoyo had designed for her, or Sakura&#145;s attempts to draw 
beautiful pictures of Tomoyo (she was still practicing her artistic 
skills even if Kerberos at times made fun of her pictures much to her 
dismay). And, sitting up on the shelves near the huge TV, were the 
DVDs which consisted of either their favorite movies slash animes, or 
the newly minted DVDs which starred herself (as Card Captor Sakura, 
and some of just her as herself) as well. It was as if Tomoyo 
dedicated her life to Sakura, and vice versa.

After a while Sakura rolled over and looked at Tomo-chan&#39;s face, 
sighing as she gazed upon her now sleeping visage. Even in the dark 
she could see Tomoyo&#39;s soft pale skin. She wanted to talk to her lover 
about her fears, maybe do something for her... but couldn&#39;t bring 
herself to do it. Now wasn&#39;t the right time. She promised Tomoyo she&#146;d 
be patient and wait. Patience, after all, was a virtue.

She only turns away for a half a minute, but that was more than enough 
time for Tomoyo to suddenly disappear from her side.

Before she could gasp she felt her bottoms sliding off and a soft 
whisper beneath her, &#147;I can&#146;t be selfish and leave your needs 
unchecked.&#148;

Sakura looked down, and almost immediately groaned as she felt her sex 
swallowed up by Tomoyo&#146;s eager mouth as she went down on Sakura&#146;s 
womanhood. Gripping the sheets tightly, Sakura swiveled and moaned 
softly, feeling Tomoyo love and lick every inch of her precious center 
until she was making Sakura&#146;s body seemingly rise in the air with each 
gasp and pant before she felt her moment crest.

As it happened she cried out, feeling her own body drop as Tomoyo&#146;s 
must have done earlier, falling--- falling--- right into Tomoyo&#146;s arms 
as she crawled up to face her, and hold her tight. The two fell asleep 
in each other&#146;s arms, holding each other tightly.

Thursday. December 26th, 2002

Tomoyo came back from the hospital a few days ago after an incident on 
Sunday.

She had been there overnight after taking a nasty fall while ice 
skating with Sakura the day before. While in a delirious state, she 
told Sakura her deepest pains--- and finally answered Sakura&#146;s long 
nagging question as to what scared Tomoyo in the night. The 
information helped, but it also affected Sakura. She wished she could 
do something--- maybe if she found the Time card she could go back in 
time, stop what happened to Tomoyo from happening. But Tomoyo 
dismissed the idea, thanking Sakura for being so concerned about her.

&#147;What&#146;s past is past. As long as you&#146;re here with me I&#146;ll overcome 
it--- someday.&#148;

Those words comforted her, yet now she didn&#146;t feel so comforted. She 
couldn&#146;t sleep. It was already 1AM in the morning but she couldn&#146;t 
sleep. Everything kept racing through her head over and over again, 
and the more she thought of it the more it hurt her to do so. Fight. 
Power. What happened to Tomoyo when she was 9.

Everything kept rolling about over and over again, and it only made 
Sakura more confused. She didn&#146;t know how to resolve her feelings. She 
didn&#146;t know how to overcome her fears. All she could do was shiver as 
she tried to make sense of it all.

That&#146;s when she felt two reassuring arms wrap around her, and hold her 
tight. Behind her, near her ear, a soft voice sang to her.

Figure Eight as Double Four.

Figure Four as Half of Eight.

If you skate, it would be great---- if you could make--- a Figure 
Eight.

That&#146;s a circle that turns round&#146; upon itself.

&#147;What&#146;s---&#148; (a finger gently shushes her)

1x8 is 2x4. 4x4 is 2x8.

If you skate upon thin ice, you&#146;d be wise if you thought twice--- 
before you make another single move---

Silence. Slowly her finger lifts from Sakura&#146;s lips.

&#147;What&#146;s that song called?&#148;

&#147;Figure Eight.&#148; Tomoyo whispers, leaning her head against Sakura&#146;s 
shoulder, &#147;It doesn&#146;t hurt as much to think about it anymore--- thank 
to you.&#148;

&#147;Did it hurt---- then?&#148; Sakura asked, her face filled with worry. 
Tomoyo only nodded and smiled, &#147;It&#146;s OK. I can speak about it--- as 
long as you&#146;re the one doing the listening.&#148; (a few seconds pass) &#147;It 
hurt when I used to think about how father played it--- to mask what 
he was--- doing to me. But I&#146;m over it. I have to be---&#148; (smiles) 
&#147;---I have you to protect me from the pain.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan---&#148;

Sakura swivels about, kissing Tomoyo softly on the lips, looking 
deeply into her eyes as she speaks again, &#147;As long as you&#146;re with me, 
Sakura-chan, I&#146;ll never suffer from doubt or fear again. My love.&#148;

Sakura smiles, hugging Tomoyo tight. &#147;Now why are you up, 
Sakura-chan?&#148;

Silence, a long worried silence. Finally, Tomoyo nods her head. &#147;I 
know what they did scared and hurt you--- but it&#146;s going to be 
alright, you&#146;ll see.&#148;

&#147;B-but--- Fight--- Power---why did they do it? Why won&#146;t they trust 
me?&#148;

&#147;They will. They just need time, like I needed time before I could 
tell you why I was afraid. Give them time and they&#146;ll come around, 
you&#146;ll see.&#148;

&#147;---am I---&#148; Sakura stammers, stopping briefly before Tomoyo motions 
for her to continue, &#147;---am I living someone else&#146;s dreams?&#148;

&#147;Someone else&#146;s?&#148;

&#147;I never wanted this before. The Clow Cards, I mean. I would have been 
happy if only to fall in love, and maybe grow up to become a famous 
archeologist--- or maybe a penguin trainer.&#148;

&#147;Definitely can&#146;t forget that!&#148; Tomoyo chides, bringing a smile to 
Sakura&#146;s lips for a few seconds before her frown returns, &#147;But--- 
after the end--- Eriol--- and everything he said--- if you hadn&#145;t 
&#147;caught&#147; me--- selfish me, couldn&#145;t see your pain---&#148;

&#147;You didn&#146;t fall. And I never thought of you as selfish--- except 
maybe when it comes to dessert!&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan!&#148; Sakura cries out, giggling abit as Tomoyo tackles her 
down into the bed, smothering her with hugs. &#147;I guess I&#146;m a little 
selfish in the dessert dept.&#148;

&#147;I know you are, my sugar craving little Card Captor!&#148;

The two laugh a little, before falling silent as they held each other, 
smiling as they relished the warmth their bodies gave off in this 
quiet span as they looked into the other&#146;s eyes. &#147;I&#146;m not as sugar 
craving as Kero, am I?&#148;

&#147;Well----&#148; Tomoyo smiles, &#147;Maybe not that bad.&#148;

The two kiss, holding each other tight as they allow sleep to overtake 
them again.

-------

Sakura yawned and stretched as the alarm clock went off.

She had not an easy time adjusting to sleep ever since Tomoyo&#146;s fall 
on the ice last Sunday. She had been a bundle of nerves worrying 
endlessly about Tomoyo, even when they got back home she only worried 
about Tomoyo. So much so, in fact, that thoughts of the dance seemed 
distant memories next to her fears.

She had not been able to find the words to comfort her beloved, though 
she knew Tomoyo was happier now that she told Sakura the truth. Still, 
Sakura wished she knew the right words to say to Tomoyo about what 
happened to her.

She decided to pay Kero a visit.

In her private &#147;room&#148;, a huge walk in closet room converted into a 
bedroom, Sakura watched as Kero rolled over in his tiny bed, clearly 
agitated that Sakura was visiting him so &#147;early&#147; in the morning. Cloud 
was slumbering peacefully in her futon tucked into a corner so the two 
kept their voices to a soft whisper as they spoke.

&quot;Would you mind not asking me silly things so early in the morning---&#147;

Kero grumbled as he rolled over, having had his fill of being Sakura&#146;s 
&#147;guidance counselor&#148; in all things related to love and &#147;family&#148; 
(Mirra-chan) for one year. He pressed his face into the little (but 
highly comfortable) pillow on his &#147;bed&#148; and sighed irritably. &#147;If it&#146;s 
as humanly possible for you, I don&#146;t suppose you would allow me to 
finish this dream I was having about chocolate cake.&quot;

Sakura sighs, &#147;But Kero! Chocolate cake?&#147;

&#147;It&#146;s a very good chocolate cake---&#147; Kero grumbles, rolling over once 
again in bed before finally giving up the ghost of a chance of gaining 
more sleep. With a stifled yawn he sits up and stares at Sakura with 
bleary eyes. &#147;I can&#146;t allow Tomoyo to torture herself like this! I 
love her too much to allow it to happen! What can I do to help her?&#147;

&#147;I don&#146;t know.&#147; Kero grumbled, before rolling back into bed again.

&#147;That&#146;s it?&#147;

&#147;That&#146;s it----&#147;

&#147;KERO-CH---!!&#148; Sakura almost yelled, quickly dimming her voice as to 
not wake Cloud up. Kero did likewise, but was still miffed. &#147;I don&#146;t 
know. Tomoyo&#146;s your lover, not mine! Go away!&#147; Kero cried out, before 
going back to sleep.

Kero was obviously in a bad mood about something, so Sakura decided to 
leave him be as she went and got dressed for her day out with Tomoyo 
today. As she changed into a nice outfit for an outing today, Sakura 
thought long and hard about how she could help Tomoyo. The obvious 
answer was to never let what happened to Tomoyo happen to Mirra. Could 
she do that? After all there really was no men in Mirra&#146;s life, and 
for all intents and purposes Sakura was the &#147;father&#148; so nothing of 
that sort could ever happen again... but then Tomoyo must have had a 
problem with it.

After breakfast Sakura put on her skates and headed outside. Tomoyo, 
already set in her blading gear and dressed quite nicely, was waiting 
by the huge ornate fence of the estate grounds. Sakura found herself 
smiling, even though she still wasn&#39;t sure about how she could protect 
Mirra from men. On the way to school she and Tomoyo talked about 
Christmas, made plans for another intimate day at Sakura&#146;s old home 
(now abandoned ever since her father vanished) and so forth. Sakura 
left out a few choice fragments, of course, like the problem with 
finding Fight again or them dealing with Power and her new &#147;parents&#147; 
the Assassin&#146; Guilders Technocrat &amp; Quake.

With all that hovering over her head, how could she even pretend to be 
able to help talk to Tomoyo about what happened to her when her own 
problems were mounting and she couldn&#146;t do a thing about them? What if 
Tomoyo-chan got mad at her interfering?

When they got to the huge mall Nina and Eliza were already there 
waiting for them. For an instance their faces stopped Sakura. They had 
such serious faces on you would have thought that somebody died--- but 
as the two came into sight their faces brightened and they were 
smiling again.

&quot;Yo, Sakura! Tomoyo! Ready to do some serious shopping?&quot; Nina called 
out, causing Sakura to blush at the attention. Thankfully Tomoyo 
answered so nobody noticed. Once they got into the mall, Sakura 
relaxed a bit as Nina&#145;s attention wandered from store to store so much 
that she stopped paying attention to either Sakura or Tomoyo.

&#147;So how&#146;s everyone?&#147;

Nina silently cursed her luck and motioned to one side, muttering 
something about &#147;The Walking 8-ball&#148; as Miss Mitsuki walked towards 
them. She and Sakura passed polite conversation, but Nina didn&#146;t want 
to be anywhere near her and for good reason (at least in her mind it 
was a good reason). Sakura spent the rest of the day just casually 
shopping while Nina did some serious shopping. At lunch in the mall&#146;s 
huge food court, Tomoyo asked the now obvious question of her, &quot;Are 
you alright Sakura? You&#39;ve been really distant lately.&quot; Sakura smiled 
at her. &quot;I just have something on my mind, Tomo-chan. Don&#39;t worry, 
don&#146;t worry! I&#39;m fine.&quot;

Still, it didn&#146;t seem at all as if she was anywhere near fine, but try 
as she might she still couldn&#146;t convince Tomoyo that she was doing 
&#147;OK&#148;. By the time it was the afternoon the only thing that held 
Sakura&#146;s attention the whole day was Tomoyo, lunch, and a movie the 
two went to to keep Sakura&#146;s mind off her troubled thoughts. She felt 
a shiver go down her spine that had nothing to do with cold or 
distaste.

She blamed herself for Tomoyo&#145;s rape at her father&#145;s hands. If she 
only hadn&#145;t agreed to visit Hong Kong for a short time with Syaoran. 
If only she didn&#145;t leave Tomoyo alone--- her father would never have 
had the chance to hurt her. If only she was there to protect Tomoyo. 
If only she&#145;d had seen right from the start the love Tomoyo had for 
her, then she wouldn&#145;t have woken to her own feelings too late to save 
Tomoyo from the incident that happened to her.

&quot;You look like you&#146;re about to cry, Sakura-chan.&quot; Tomoyo whispered, 
drawing close to Sakura to shield her from the others around them in 
the mall. Sakura looked up startled and blushed. &quot;Oh, sorry...&quot; She 
apologized, wiping her face as she gathered up her wits and focused 
again on not losing the stuff she bought today. Tomoyo smiled at her. 
&quot;It&#39;s alright. I&#39;m sure you have plenty of things on your mind. Just 
remember I&#146;m here if you need a shoulder to lean on, alright?&quot; Sakura 
nodded. &quot;Thanks Tomo-chan--- I could use that on the bus ride home--- 
if you don&#146;t mind that is!!&#147; She nodded. &quot;I don&#146;t mind.&#147;

The bus ride home was quiet, but it was also relaxing. As she 
promised, the minute they got on Tomoyo took the window seat at the 
back of the bus and drew Sakura&#146;s head onto her shoulder. She then 
took her arm around Sakura&#146;s waist while her other hand grasped 
Sakura&#146;s hand and held it tight as the bus rambled on home.

&quot;I&#146;m such a child. Everything makes me cry--- I&#146;m such a child.&#147;

Tomoyo giggled at that revelation and hugged her. &quot;Yeah, that sounds 
like you. But I love every part of you--- even the part that 
occasionally cries because she&#146;s in pain.&#147; Sakura blushed at the 
compliment but quickly composed herself. &quot;Um, I don&#146;t want to be a 
burden to you, Tomo-chan.&quot;

&#147;You&#146;re never a burden to me.&#148; she reassured her.

When they got to the Daidouji Estates, Tomoyo suddenly stopped and 
looked at Sakura. &quot;Sakura-chan. Listen to me---&#147; (she waved off any 
protest before Sakura could even form them in her mind) &#147;---your not 
to blame.&#147;

&#147;Blame?&#147; Sakura tried to sound confident, as if she didn&#146;t know what 
Tomoyo was talking about, but Tomoyo wasn&#146;t buying it. &#147;You can&#146;t lie 
to me, Sakura-chan, remember? I know you feel as if it&#146;s your fault I 
was---&#147;

&#147;IT IS!!&#147; Sakura blurt out, a tear rolling down her cheek. &#147;If only I 
stood by your side--- I could have stopped him! Made him go away! He 
wouldn&#146;t have---&#147; Tomoyo rushes up, her strong arms holding Sakura 
tight as she hugs her, &#147;Oh, Sakura-chan! Please don&#146;t do this to 
yourself! Please---&#147; (she sobs) &#147;---that was my fear.&#147;

&#147;Your--- fear?&#147;

Silence. A long awkward silence as Tomoyo gathered her feelings. 
Finally Sakura acted on her feelings. She leaned in and kissed Tomoyo 
on the lips. &#147; I never wanted you to be hurt--- I never knew until 
then just how special you were to me--- how much I---&#147;

Tomoyo sighs, holding Sakura tighter, more this time for her own needs 
than just to stop Sakura. When they got inside the two slowly walked 
up to their bedroom, shut the door, and laid down in bed holding each 
other tightly.

Meanwhile---

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I did that! What was I thinking? I am such an idiot.&quot;

Kero huffed and puffed, and flapped his wings madly. At that, Cloud 
laughed as she did her own version of a &#147;victory dance&#148;. The two, 
Kerberos and the now former Clow Card Cloud (before Mirra took her 
powers from her, sealing it back into card form) lived in the closet. 
Had been living in there since Christmas Eve. As he flew up from his 
spot on the floor to his bed, he wasn&#146;t in a mood to talk. He had been 
playing an addictive two player game with Cloud and he finally lost to 
her. It was only made that much more painful to take because it was 
one of his favorite games (Mario Party 4)!

He landed on the bed and sighed irritably as Cloud got herself a soda 
from Kero&#146;s fridge, opening it up and taking a sip. &quot;I&#146;m the master of 
that game! Me!&#147; Cloud shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t think so, Kero-chan!&#147; 
Kero sighed. &quot;Well don&#146;t let anyone else hear that!&#147; he groaned, to 
which she said &#147;Hear what? That I beat you? That you&#146;re my---&#147;

&#147;That you and I used to be--- I mean we--- DON&#146;T MENTION IT!!&#147;

&#147;Why not? Who am I going to tell?&#148; Cloud baited, poking Kero as she 
did. &#147;Everyone thinks I&#146;m a little kid anyway, so who do I tell that 
I&#146;m really quite an intelligent woman in a little girl&#146;s body, and I 
only play like a little girl because I like to tease people? And how 
you and I used to have the most intense sex behind everyone&#146;s back 
when you and I were---&#148;

&#147;Come on, Cyan! Don&#146;t torture me!&quot; Kero moaned. &quot;I can&#146;t love you like 
this--- in this little toy bear body--- it&#146;s embarrassing! I thought 
they&#146;d seal you again and I wouldn&#146;t have to think about how much 
I---&#148;

&#147;Love me? Cherish me? Call me your precious little Cyan-chan?&#148;

At that Kero groaned and covered his head with the bed&#145;s small 
blanket, &#147;Maybe I&#39;ll have the sleep card put me to sleep for a 
thousand years (if we ever catch it again)... or maybe I&#39;ll just jump 
off the roof without even bothering to try and fly (heard that brat 
survived doing that once in my body so maybe that&#145;s a no-go).&quot; Kero 
sighed irritably to himself. &#147;I don&#146;t feel very manly right now, if 
it&#145;s all the same to you, Cyan. And you acting like a total airhead in 
everyone&#146;s presence makes me look like a lolicon freak when Mirra 
talks about our loving relationship in the past!&#147;

Cloud, confused, grabbed her pillow and flopped down in a lying 
position to look up at Kero. &#147;What&#145;s a &#147;lolicon&#147;? Is that something to 
suck on?&#148;

&#147;Never mind.&#148; he grumbled, huffing his breath as he pouted.

&quot;Come on now, tell me what&#39;s the matter.&quot; Cloud asked, waiting for a 
reply.

Kero, slowly turning his head, could barely say the words. His eyes 
were dim and misty, and he looked like he was about to cry. Cloud 
looked at the guardian beast, and felt only sorrow for him. &quot;... I 
missed you.&#147; he finally said, &#147;For the longest time--- I finally 
learned to forget you and now this comes up and----&quot;

&#147;You want it to be the way it used to be, but it can&#146;t--- for now at 
least. Not until you can change back and I can be---&#148; (puts her hand 
high above her head, looking up at it as if straining to see how much 
taller she had to be, then she shrugs) &#147;---bigger me.&#147; She finished, 
to which Kero weakly nodded his head. &quot;I don&#39;t pretend to understand 
love, Cyan. Hell, I can&#146;t even help Sakura with her problems. But I do 
know that I love you, and I wish I was the man you deserve--- when 
your not acting like a complete brat!&#148;

&#147;BIDA!!&#147; Cloud huffed, sticking her tongue out at Kero and briefly 
going back to her childish mode. But just as quickly as her outburst 
came, it went away again. She laid down on the pillow and looked up at 
where Kero&#145;s bed was in the shelves. &quot;How can you lay up there and 
think that all I cared about was the sex? I love you. My sweet, kind, 
always hungry piggy of a chivalrous yet kinda pesky at times beautiful 
lover, I love you. Sure I act like an irresponsible brat when people 
are around us. And sure I even act like a brat when we&#146;re alone at 
times---&#147;

&#147;Just noticed? And who are you calling piggy? I have a healthy 
appetite!&#147;

&#147;Quiet, you.&#147; she warned, hating when he threw her train of thought 
off like that, &#147;Still, I know I love you---- just as much as Mistress 
loves Tomoyo.&#147;

&#147;I wish I was big again---&#148;

&#147;So we could love each other just like Mistress and Tomoyo?&#148;

&#147;So I can put you over my knee and paddle you hard for being such a 
blowhard about your gaming abilities! I---&#148;

That, in a nutshell, did it. &#147;B-b-blowhard?!?&#148; (Cloud huffed her 
breath, jumping up to grab Kero and bring him back to the game) &#147;Your 
JEALOUS and I&#146;ll prove it!&#148; (slipping back to childish mode) &#147;LET&#146;S 
PLAY AGAIN!! LET&#146;S PLAY AGAIN!!&#148;

&#147;---sigh---&#148; Kero sets a new board in motion, smiling abit though now 
that he was back next to Cloud&#146;s side.
