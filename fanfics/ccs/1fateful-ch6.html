<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/1fateful-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>ARE THEY HAPPY? ARE THEY ANGRY? WILL THEY APPROVE OF THEIR LOVE? 

As they approached Tomoyo&#39;s house, Sakura started to get nervous and had 
second thoughts about telling Tomoyo&#39;s mom. 

&quot;What if she doesn&#39;t like the idea of us being in love and she forbids 
you from seeing me again?&quot;  

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Sakura, she&#39;ll understand. Even if she does forbid me from 
seeing you, I&#39;ll find some way to be with you.&quot; 

&quot;Thank You.&quot; Said Sakura giving Tomoyo a big hug. 

&quot;I&#39;m home!!&quot; Yelled Tomoyo as she walked in the door. 

&quot;Hi sweetie.&quot; Said Tomoyo&#39;s mom while giving her a hug. 

&quot;Mom? Sakura and I need to talk to you about something.&quot; 

&quot;Ok. But why don&#39;t you go upstairs and change first. I&#39;ll make some tea 
and wait for you in the living room. Ok?&quot; 

&quot;Alright, come on Sakura.&quot; 

Sakura always liked coming over to Tomoyo&#39;s house. It was so big and 
beautiful, it made her feel like she was a princess in a fairytale.  

&quot;Sakura? Can you throw my clothes in the hamper for me?&quot; Asked Tomoyo as 
they entered her room. 

&quot;Sure.&quot;  

Tomoyo walked over to her closet while Sakura looked through her bag for 
Tomoyo&#39;s clothes. She plopped them in the hamper like she was asked. 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Said Tomoyo while taking off the pair of jeans and the 
halter-top that she borrowed from Sakura. 

Sakura picked them up and started folding them while Tomoyo took off her 
bra and Panties that she also borrowed from Sakura. 

&quot;That feels better!&quot; She says, as she slips on her own clothes. 

&quot;Ok, lets go downstairs and have some tea.&quot; 

Just like she said, Tomoyo&#39;s mom was sitting in the living room, waiting 
with the tea. 

&quot;So? What was it that you two wanted to talk to me about?&quot; 

Sakura tensed up, her fists clenched and her face turning red. 

&quot;Well, said Tomoyo. When I was at Sakura&#39;s house yesterday, I asked her 
if she had anything on her mind that she needed to tell me. She had been 
acting strange for a few days and I was worried. When I asked her, I 
knew in my heart what she was going to say.&quot; 

She took Sakura&#39;s hand in hers for reassurance.  

&quot;We talked for a long time and came to the same answer, We were in love 
with each other.&quot; 

&quot;Well...I&#39;m glad you two were finally able to tell each other how you 
felt.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re not angry with us?&quot; Said Sakura. 

&quot;No! I&#39;m happy for you two!&quot;  

Sakura and Tomoyo&#39;s eyes lit up with joy.  

&quot;Thank You mom!!&quot; Said Tomoyo giving her mom a big hug.  

&quot;Thank You.&quot; Said  Sakura, also giving her a hug.  

&quot;So how did your dad take it Sakura?&quot;  

&quot;Well...&quot; 

&quot;We haven&#39;t told him yet.&quot; Interrupted Tomoyo. 

&quot;I&#39;m scared to tell him.&quot; Said Sakura. &quot;I&#39;m scared that he&#39;ll take it 
badly and forbid us from seeing each other.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve known your dad for a long time Sakura. I think his reaction will 
be the same as mine. He just wants to see his daughter happy, no matter 
what.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, It&#39;ll be fine. Tell you what...I&#39;ll go over to your place 
with you when you tell him. Ok?&quot; 

&quot;Thank You, that would be nice.&quot; 

&quot;Now, lets drink this tea before it gets cold!&quot; 

After having their tea, Tomoyo&#39;s mom drove them back to Sakura&#39;s house. 
When they got there they found out from Touya that her dad went to the 
market and would be back soon. So while they waited, Sakura fixed 
everyone a Sandwich. 

&quot;Here you are.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks Monster.&quot; 

&quot;Just for that I&#39;m going to eat yours too Touya.&quot; 

&quot;Come on, I&#39;m only teasing. Can I still have it please?&quot;  

&quot;Ok, here.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks Monster.&quot; 

Sakura gave Touya a nasty look while Tomoyo and her mother laughed. 

&quot;I&#39;m Home!!&quot; Said Sakura&#39;s dad as he walked in the door. 

&quot;Hi dad! Here, let me help you with those.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks Sakura.&quot; 

&quot;Dad? We need to talk to you about something.&quot; 

&quot;We?&quot;  

&quot;Hello.&quot; Said Tomoyo and her mom. 

&quot;Hi.&quot; 

&quot;Come join us.&quot; 

&quot;Sure. What&#39;s this all about? Touya? Do you know?&quot; 

&quot;Nope, not yet.&quot; 

Sakura sat down on the couch next to Tomoyo and her mother. 

&quot;Dad... Touya...&quot; 

&quot;Last night... when Tomoyo came over, she asked me if there was anything 
that I wanted to tell her. She knew that I had something on my mind and 
she was pretty sure what it was, with her and I being best friends for 
so long now. Her and I sat in my room and talked for what seemed to be 
hours. When we were finished, both her and I realized how the other 
felt.&quot; 

&quot;Dad, Touya. Tomoyo and I...&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;re...&quot;  

&quot;It&#39;s ok Sakura dear.&quot; Reassured Tomoyo&#39;s mom. &quot;Just tell them how you 
feel.&quot;  

Sakura sighed. &quot;Tomoyo and I are in love.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s great!&quot; Said Sakura&#39;s dad. 

&quot;So... who are the unfortunate souls that you two suckered in?&quot; Remarked 
Touya. 

&quot;Touya... are you really that dense?&quot; Asked Sakura&#39;s dad. &quot;They&#39;re not 
in love with two boys... they&#39;re in love with each other.&quot; 

&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Touya yells as he looks back at Sakura and Tomoyo, who&#39;s faces 
are deep red with embarrassment. 

&quot;Well I can&#39;t speak for Touya, but I&#39;m happy for you two.&quot; Says Sakura&#39;s 
dad.  

&quot;Thanks dad... I wasn&#39;t sure how you would react to this, I was scared 
that you wouldn&#39;t like it. That&#39;s why Tomoyo&#39;s mom said that she would 
be with us when we told you.&quot; 

&quot;Well, I guess this means we don&#39;t have to worry about you falling in 
love with that brat huh?&quot;  

&quot;He&#39;s not a brat!!&quot; Sakura yelled to Touya. 

Touya was referring to when Sakura had a crush on Sayoran. 

The five of them talked for hours about love and relationships. Before 
they knew it, it was getting to be really late.  

&quot;Oh my goodness!! Look at the time!!&quot; Said Tomoyo. 

&quot;Oh! Well we better get going.&quot; Said Tomoyo&#39;s mom. &quot;Tomorrow&#39;s a school 
day, and you girls need your rest.&quot; 

&quot;Ok.&quot; Said Tomoyo. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow Sakura.&quot; 

&quot;See you tomorrow.&quot; 

The two of them gave each other a goodnight kiss, and Tomoyo and her 
mother left for home.  </pre>
