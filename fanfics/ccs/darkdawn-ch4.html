<h1>Darkest Before the Dawn (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/darkdawn-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The apartment was cozy and warm, even as gusts of snow blew outside 
the insulated windows. Sakura was curled up in her favorite chair, 
fast asleep, after eating a good meal and a long day at work. 
Thankfully, the term was over and the holiday beginning, so Sakura&#39;s 
duties as a teacher would be less pressing.

Tomoyo&#39;s latest documentary was completed, and she had decided it was 
time to take a little break between her almost continuous film 
projects. &#39;Be honest with yourself,&#39; Tomoyo thought a bit sadly, 
&#39;you&#39;re taking a break to keep an eye on Sakura.&#39; She leaned back in 
her own chair, looking across at Sakura.

Sakura&#39;s business wear looked more like a costume on the young woman, 
and Tomoyo almost expected her to cast it off to reveal one of her own 
designs beneath it. Her red/auburn hair fell into her eyes, 
occasionally shifted by a sleepy sigh. She was tall and thin, but she 
was regaining all the muscle and flesh she lost under Li&#39;s harsh 
treatment.

Sakura shifted, then stretched, returning to the land of the waking. 
She smiled across at Tomoyo, &quot;You should have woke me up.&quot;

Tomoyo smiled and shrugged, &quot;But you looked so cute asleep.&quot; Sakura 
blushed, and she laughed softly, &quot;You&#39;re cute when you blush, too.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tease me,&quot; Sakura protested weakly.

&quot;But it&#39;s so fun,&quot; Tomoyo added, getting up out of her chair and 
stretching. &quot;Besides,&quot; she said a bit more seriously, &quot;it&#39;s the 
truth.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sakura said softly. She quickly tried to change the 
subject, &quot;Did your mother say who she was bringing to Christmas, 
tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;Not yet, just that it&#39;d be a surprise,&quot; Tomoyo said with a little 
frown.

&quot;Good surprise or bad surprise?&quot; Sakura asked curiously. Tomoyo 
shrugged, eloquently showing her lack of knowledge on that topic.

Tomoyo suddenly yawned involuntarily, blushing a bit. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she 
apologized. &quot;I think we&#39;d better get to bed,&quot; she said, and began to 
slowly walk towards her bedroom, &quot;we&#39;ve got a long day ahead of us 
tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Tomoyo,&quot; Sakura started, then stopped. Tomoyo turned, the girl stood 
there uncomfortably, shifting back and forth.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Tomoyo finally asked her. She tried to meet Sakura&#39;s 
eyes, but the woman was looking down at the carpet nervously.

&quot;Could I sleep with you tonight?&quot; Sakura asked softly. She looked up, 
and Tomoyo saw the faint glimmer of tears on her cheeks, &quot;I just don&#39;t 
want to be alone.&quot;

Tomoyo nodded slightly, moving to Sakura&#39;s side and gently leading her 
down the hallway. They stripped almost silently, and Tomoyo let Sakura 
climb into bed first. She gave her a moment to get comfortable, then 
climbed in beside her.

Sakura&#39;s eyes were wide with fear, and she was shaking slightly. 
&quot;Shhh,&quot; Tomoyo soothed her, reaching out to gently stroke her hair, &quot;I 
won&#39;t hurt you, I&#39;d never hurt you.&quot; She gently slipped her arms 
around Sakura, just holding her lightly.

&quot;I know,&quot; Sakura answered in a whisper, &quot;I trust you, Tomoyo.&quot; She 
tried to slide her hands down Tomoyo&#39;s front, only to feel soft hands 
grasp her own.

&#39;Trust,&#39; Tomoyo thought sadly, &#39;not love.&#39; She simply held Sakura, 
gently, &quot;You don&#39;t have to do that, Sakura. I&#39;m here for you, if you 
need me.&quot; She closed her eyes, thinking, &#39;And I don&#39;t think I could 
bear it, having sex with you without your loving me.&#39;

Sakura remained silent, finally relaxing against her breast and 
falling asleep. Tomoyo lay there awake for a little while longer, 
silently cursing her more noble instincts.

&quot;That was nice,&quot; Kaho sighed softly, lying in a sweaty heap on the bed 
beside Sonomi.

&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Sonomi agreed wordlessly, sex with Kaho was very nice. No bad 
scenes, no jealously angry ex-girlfriends, just two grown women with 
mutual needs meeting to satisfy them. It was her fear of disturbing 
that overall niceness that held Sonomi back from popping the big 
question. And she was running out of time.

&quot;Would you like your Christmas present early?&quot; Kaho asked her with a 
contented smile. She wanted to laugh, Sonomi looked so much like a 
drowsy cat, sprawled out on top of the covers looking so obviously 
happy.

&quot;I was thinking about something tomorrow, actually,&quot; Sonomi said 
softly. Kaho looked at her questioningly, and Sonomi mustered her 
nerve to ask, &quot;Would you like to go to a Christmas party with me 
tomorrow?&quot;

Kaho threw her arms around Sonomi&#39;s neck, kissing her vigorously. &quot;I&#39;d 
love to,&quot; she said, her eyes sparkling. &quot;Where is it?&quot;

&quot;Family thing, actually,&quot; Sonomi said nervously. &quot;My daughter and 
Sakura are holding a Christmas party, and she invited me and a guest,&quot; 
she explained.

Kaho chuckled softly, &quot;Bringing me home to meet the family?&quot;

&quot;I guess I am,&quot; Sonomi answered with a shy smile. &quot;You don&#39;t mind 
missing the party at Arisugawa&#39;s Locket, do you?&quot;

&quot;Maybe we can all go there later,&quot; Kaho said thoughtfully. She frowned 
in memory, &quot;Wasn&#39;t Tomoyo always around Sakura?&quot;

&quot;Good memory,&quot; Sonomi said with a sad nod. &quot;But as far as I know 
they&#39;ve never been together romantically.&quot;

&quot;Poor Tomoyo,&quot; Kaho sighed, thinking of the glances Tomoyo had been 
always giving Sakura when she had been teaching the two of them. She 
looked thoughtfully at Sonomi, &quot;Do you think we should try and help 
fix them up?&quot;

Sonomi shook her head firmly, &quot;Tomoyo would not appreciate someone 
interfering with her love life, trust me on that.&quot;

Mei-Lin stood in the ankle-deep snow, looking quite miserable as she 
looked out over the busy intersection. Cars rushed back and forth, 
people bustled about, and Mei-Lin strode to ignore it all as she 
focused on the past. Her eyes closed, she softly chanted a carefully 
chosen spell, and the accident ran across her mind&#39;s eye, exactly as 
it actually happened.

Li&#39;s car was still, him sitting unconscious behind the wheel, as he 
was carefully placed in the intersection before the truck started up. 
It started from several streets over, building up speed, before 
striking with bone crushing force.

Mei-Lin&#39;s eyes snapped open, and the people nearby scrambled away as 
she glowed a sullen red. Noticing this, she calms herself, the glow 
fading. &#39;A professional team of hitmen,&#39; she thought grimly, &#39;but who 
hired them, and why?&#39;

Not long after, the police station bustled, as she carefully navigated 
to the desk she wanted. &quot;Were you the primary officer in the Li 
Sayoran investigation?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, who wants to know?&quot; he asked with a frown.

&quot;Friend of the family,&quot; Mei-Lin answered him calmly. &quot;I called you 
earlier, do you have the case files ready?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but they&#39;re confidential,&quot; he answered sullenly, &quot;I can&#39;t let 
you look at them.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Mei-Lin said quite insincerely, and walked a few steps 
away. She drew a metallic disk from her clothes, and her sword 
appeared in her hands.

&quot;Time!&quot; she cried, the sword stabbing at the coin. The letters on the 
coin blazed as the spell took effect, and time seemed to stop in the 
station. She snatched the files from the officer&#39;s desk, and with a 
single word copied them, exactly. She hid the copies in her coat, put 
the originals back, and then released the time spell.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to waste your time,&quot; Mei-Lin said with a little bow, 
before quickly exiting the police station. She didn&#39;t want to give 
anyone the chance to figure out something was going on.

Back at the hotel room, she went over the documents carefully, 
tracking the progress of the police investigation. Ruled an accident, 
they had only done a cursory investigation of the people in Li&#39;s life. 
She frowned, reading a footnote on the bottom of one file.

&quot;Allegations of physical abuse were made by Mrs. Kinomoto-Sayoran, 
they were investigated and dismissed,&quot; it simply read. She 
involuntarily crushed the papers in her hand as a sudden surge of 
anger ran through her.

&quot;That&#39;s a lie,&quot; Mei-Lin cursed under her breath. She looked at the 
papers a moment, calming herself, &quot;Sakura. Could it have been her?&quot;

She got up, pacing the small hotel room restlessly. She couldn&#39;t 
believe the sweet girl she had known could have ordered the killing of 
the man she loved. Still, it had been a long time since she had seen 
her, and people did change.

Mei-Lin looked out the window, at the snow gently falling down 
outside. Whatever was going on, she needed to see Sakura, to find out 
what had happened between her and Li before he died. And if Sakura was 
responsible, she&#39;d make her pay.

Tomoyo smiled happily, picking up the phone early the next morning. 
She was laying in her bed all alone, Sakura had gotten up before her, 
and she could smell Sakura puttering about in the apartment&#39;s small 
kitchen.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Tomoyo said into the phone.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Sonomi said, sounding quite cheerful, &quot;I&#39;m just making 
sure you know I&#39;m bringing a guest with me tonight.&quot;

&quot;Do you want me to get him or her a gift?&quot; Tomoyo asked curiously, 
wondering if she could run and get a generic gift or two on Christmas 
Eve.

&quot;I&#39;m bringing something for her with me,&quot; Sonomi answered cheerfully.

Tomoyo looked quite attentive as she asked her, &quot;Is this a date for 
you two? And are you ever going to tell me who it is?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll find out tonight,&quot; Sonomi chuckled, &quot;and yes, I do think it&#39;s 
a date.&quot;

&quot;Congratulations,&quot; Tomoyo said happily. She heard Sakura call her 
name, &quot;Sorry, got to go!&quot; She put the phone down only to see Sakura 
walk in carrying a tray loaded with two servings of pancakes, bacon 
and eggs.

They sat down on the bed together, and began to eat. Tomoyo was 
raising a forkful of pancake to her mouth when she stopped and asked, 
&quot;Where&#39;s Kero?&quot;

Sakura chuckled softly, &quot;I gave him his own plate in the kitchen.&quot; 
They shared a quiet laugh at the appetite of the little guardian 
beast.

They ate quietly, enjoying each other&#39;s company. Tomoyo felt Sakura&#39;s 
eyes resting on her, questioning, but instead she concentrated on 
eating. Finally, Sakura spoke up, &quot;Tomoyo, why did you stop me, last 
night?&quot;

Tomoyo blushed softly, &quot;You were so scared. I didn&#39;t think you wanted 
me to...&quot;

Sakura&#39;s eyes met Tomoyo&#39;s for a moment. &quot;I was scared,&quot; she admitted, 
&quot;and I&#39;m not sure about how I feel.&quot; She sighed softly, looking away, 
&quot;I made such a mistake with Li, I don&#39;t trust my own instincts 
anymore.&quot; Tomoyo winced at the sound of her former rival&#39;s name, even 
as she searched for the right thing to say.

Tomoyo gently put her hand on Sakura&#39;s, &quot;Give yourself time, please. I 
don&#39;t want you running to... someone just because you&#39;re scared of 
being alone, or rebounding.&quot;

&quot;But what if it&#39;s love?&quot; Sakura challenged her softly, and Tomoyo sat 
there, for once at a complete loss for words. </pre>
