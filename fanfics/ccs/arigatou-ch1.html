<h1>Arigatou</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rfenrir.html">Riesz Fenrir</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This is the first fanfic I&#39;ve ever written, about any series, so please 
don&#39;t flame me too hard for it. ^_^; Die-hard fans may well be able to 
find some inaccuracies, since I&#39;ve not seen that much of ::cough:: 
&quot;Cardcaptors&quot; and even less of CCS itself. In fact, this is largely 
based on the manga, which I have a lot more of (plus it&#39;s cuter ^_^). 

Oh, and a warning: this is angst, pure and simple. Don&#39;t expect happy 
endings.  

Stuff in *asterisks* = thoughts.  

-----------------------------------------------------------

       *&quot;You don&#39;t know just how much.... I love you, Sakura.&quot;*

       Tomoyo sat on the bed in the middle of her expansive, 
exquisitely-decorated quarters at the Daidouji mansion. Not that one 
would be able to tell from a glance around the room that intricately-
patterned magnolia wallpaper, or indeed anything at all, lay behind the 
countless photographs of Sakura that covered the walls ceiling to 
floor. One more rested in Tomoyo&#39;s hands as she gazed absently out of 
the window towards Tomoeda Elementary.

       *Morning classes will be nearly over by now....* Tomoyo knew she 
ought to be at school too, but over these past few weeks, it seemed, 
Sakura and Syaoran had been getting closer. A *lot* closer. Tomoyo 
sighed. What was her problem anyway? She had always said she&#39;d be happy 
if Sakura was happy. And Syaoran did make Sakura happy.... which was 
the one thing that tore Tomoyo&#39;s heart to shreds. Seeing them together 
like that.... holding hands, laughing...... *like we used to be.....*       
So here she was, alone in her room, pretending to be too sick to go. 
*It&#39;s the truth, anyway.... only the sickness is in my heart. I just 
didn&#39;t think I could face another day of living my life this way.... 
putting on that same smile, pretending everything&#39;s okay........*

       Tomoyo&#39;s gaze returned to the picture in her hand.

       *It&#39;s not okay......*

       Most of the pictures that lined Tomoyo&#39;s walls were of Sakura as 
only Tomoyo knew her; as the Card Captor, the defender of Tomoeda from 
the Clow Cards&#39; evil...... but this, this was just everyday, ordinary 
Sakura, smiling as she made her way to school. Only there had never 
been anything &quot;everyday&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot; about Sakura. She was perfection 
itself..... the touch of her smooth, soft, lightly-tanned skin..... the 
way the light danced in those intense, emerald-green eyes when she 
smiled..... the sweet scent of her short auburn hair..... the 
gentleness of her voice.... all things that could melt Tomoyo in a 
heartbeat.

       *It&#39;s not okay......*

       A single hot tear slid down Tomoyo&#39;s cheek and fell onto the 
photograph. Her hand, seemingly independent of her conscious mind, 
reached behind her and groped for something on the bedside table. 
Tomoyo&#39;s trembling hands unsheathed the small penknife as she brought 
it back into her tear-blurred view. Her eyes closed, squeezing out 
another tear.

       *It&#39;s not okay!*

       The sound of Tomoyo&#39;s own scream broke into her thoughts, 
jolting her back to reality. A place to which she had no desire to 
return any longer. She didn&#39;t need to open her eyes to feel the blood 
trickling down her arm. Concentrating on the warm sensation, allowing 
the darkness to encapsulate her senses, coccooning her within 
herself.... as the initial stinging sensation faded, it began to feel 
calming, almost.... comforting. Tomoyo wrapped her arms around herself 
and huddled blindly into her pillows.

       *Sakura-chan.....*

       As if answering her silent call, the phone rang. Reluctantly, 
almost tentatively, Tomoyo opened her eyes and released the pillow she 
was hugging, reaching for the pink cellphone with clammy, bloodstained 
fingers.

       &quot;M...moshi-moshi?&quot; she half-whispered, her voice weak and shaky.       
&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot; While she knew that only Sakura would ever call her on 
this phone, the sound of her voice still made her heart jump 
unexpectedly.

       &quot;...Hai......&quot;

       &quot;I was just calling to see how you were..... Terada-sensei said 
you weren&#39;t feeling too good......&quot;

       &quot;......I&#39;m okay.......&quot;

       &quot;You don&#39;t sound it, Tomoyo-chan.......... Do you want me to 
come over?&quot;

       Tomoyo took a deep breath. &quot;........Onegai............... if 
it&#39;s not too much trouble..............&quot;

       Sakura laughed a little on the other end of the phone. &quot;Of 
course not, baka! Nothing&#39;s too much trouble for my best friend!&quot;

       &quot;.......Arigatou...........&quot;

       &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll be there right away. Ja ne...&quot;

       &quot;......Ja ne.&quot; The line went dead as Sakura hung up.

       For the ten minutes it took for Sakura to arrive, Tomoyo sat 
cross-legged on the bed, motionless, her back to the door. She clutched 
her left arm tightly to her chest, deep crimson fluid soaking into her 
nightshirt, the pain now reduced to a dull throb. It was in this state 
that Sakura found her.

       &quot;Tomoyo-chan.....?&quot; Sakura&#39;s soft, inquiring voice floated into 
her thoughts, at first a distant echo, a lingering echo of a long-faded 
dream..... then gradually, the voice became clearer, sharper, as though 
the one she dreamed of stood right by her side.........

       &quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

       Tomoyo&#39;s eyes flickered open to see Sakura&#39;s questioning face, a 
mixture of concern and anxiety in those deep, all-encapsulating green 
eyes.

       &quot;Tomoyo-chan, are you....&quot; Sakura gasped a little as Tomoyo&#39;s 
hand shifted, uncovering the stains on her shirt. &quot;Tomoyo-chan! You&#39;re 
hurt....&quot;

       Tomoyo whimpered a little as Sakura sat down beside her and 
gently moved her arm away from her chest to examine the wound. &quot;How 
did......&quot; Sakura began, stopping in her tracks when her gaze was 
caught by the bloodied penknife that still lay on the bedclothes. Her 
eyes turned back to Tomoyo&#39;s, green orbs of disbelief meeting greyish-
blue pools of fear. A single word escaped her lips. &quot;Why.......?&quot;

       Tomoyo struggled to break the intensity of Sakura&#39;s gaze, but 
failed. Slowly, her right hand opened to reveal the crumpled, tear-
stained picture she had been clutching the entire time. Sakura glanced 
down at it, then back at Tomoyo, a blank look in her eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t 
understand, Tomoyo-chan....&quot; Another tear silently slid down Tomoyo&#39;s 
cheek, and Sakura absently wiped it away with her fingertips, causing 
the dark-haired girl to shudder slightly at her friend&#39;s tender touch.       
&quot;S...Sakura-chan....... I.......I.......&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s cheeks reddened 
suddenly as the realisation of just how close Sakura was dawned upon 
her. Suddenly dumbstruck, in a momentary lapse of rational thought she 
leaned in closer to Sakura and briefly allowed their lips to brush. 
*Surely... this will make her understand.....*

       It did.

       Sakura jumped back suddenly, her mind swirling with confusion 
that quickly turned to dizzying realisation. *I love you a lot too, 
Sakura....* She stared at Tomoyo, who returned the gaze, her eyes 
threatening tears once more, pleading for acceptance. Sakura felt tears 
sting her own eyes too as she realised that for the first time in their 
lives there was nothing she could do to help her friend. &quot;I...... I&#39;m 
sorry........... Tomoyo-chan..........&quot; Her words barely came out as a 
whisper, but they were clear enough to Tomoyo. Feeling powerless to do 
anything else, Sakura turned and fled from the room.  

-----------------------------------------------------------

       Too shaken by Tomoyo&#39;s unspoken revelation to return to school, 
Sakura made her way towards Penguin Park in a haze. *A place where 
Tomoyo and me spent so much time together....... will it ever be the 
same?* She sat down heavily inside the great King Penguin that was 
seemingly Tomoeda&#39;s primary landmark, leaning back against its inner 
walls with an anguished sigh. It wasn&#39;t that this kind of thing 
disgusted her.... it wasn&#39;t even that new to her, really. After all, 
her brother and Yukito..... But somehow, Tomoyo&#39;s actions today had 
changed things between them. The dark-haired girl was her best friend, 
she had been since third grade, and Sakura couldn&#39;t imagine what her 
life would be like without her, but... after today, she thought, a 
sickening feeling growing in her stomach at the fact that she could 
think of her best friend with such callousness, she wasn&#39;t sure if she 
could ever feel comfortable around Tomoyo again. Not in the same way.       
&quot;Hoeeee.......&quot;  

-----------------------------------------------------------

       Tomoyo&#39;s eyes were fixated on the screen as she sat alone in her 
video room, the almost stifling darkness illuminated only by the glow 
of the projected image. The penknife dangled limply from her fingers, 
crimson liquid flowing freely down the smooth blade from the deep 
gashes in her wrists, seeming almost black in the half-light.

       The on-screen Sakura smiled and waved, and Tomoyo couldn&#39;t help 
but manage a wavering attempt at a smile in return.

       *Arigatou, Sakura-chan...... for everything....................*

       Sakura&#39;s image blurred and flickered as a mixture of sadness, 
pain and resignation brought new tears to her reddened eyes once more. 
And as the last scenes of Tomoyo&#39;s home movie faded to black, so did 
Tomoyo&#39;s world.... forever.  *&quot;Thank you for all your tenderness.... 
Thank you for all your happiness.... Thank you for all your 
kindness.... Thank you for all your everything.............&quot;*

Author&#39;s notes: Crying yet? ;_; Probably with tears of frustration at 
how people such as me can be allowed to call themselves writers..... 
Still, I had a go, can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t. I love S&amp;T fluff as much as the 
next shoujo-ai fan, it&#39;s true, but I don&#39;t think there are enough fics 
out there that deal with the harsh reality - that, while we all know 
Tomoyo loves Sakura, Sakura almost certainly would not return her 
feelings... ;_; Also, this was inspired by real, personal feelings, so 
I&#39;d appreciate it if you didn&#39;t riff it no matter how much you think it 
sucks. Thanks.... and if you liked, or you didn&#39;t like, or you want to 
throw comments/criticism/whatevers my way, email me. I promise to reply 
to all non-flames.  Now go and read some fluff! ^_^
