<h1>Love Forever (part 8 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Tomoyo woke up and noticed that Sakura wasn&#39;t in bed. Concerned, she put 
on her robe and started looking for her. She walked into the living room 
and found Sakura asleep with her head on her book. Tomoyo giggled and 
quickly went back to their room to get her Camera. She returned and 
started filming her dear, sleeping Sakura-chan. 

&quot;She&#39;s so cute!&quot; Tomoyo said in a loud whisper.

&quot;Mmmm... Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Asked Sakura sleepily.

&quot;Sorry... I didn&#39;t mean to wake you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ok. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to move in the morning if I slept 
like that all night.&quot; Sakura replied while rubbing her neck. Tomoyo 
stopped filming and set her Camera on the table. She stood behind the 
couch and started massaging Sakura&#39;s neck and shoulders.

&quot;You should get some sleep Sakura-chan. Tomorrow&#39;s going to be a busy 
day and you need your rest.&quot;

&quot;Mmm-hmm.&quot;

Tomoyo noticed Sakura shiver and said that they should get back to bed 
before they catch cold. She helped Sakura off the couch. But, before 
they headed back to bed, Tomoyo looked outside and turned Sakura to see.

&quot;It&#39;s snowing!&quot; Yelped Sakura. &quot;It&#39;s so beautiful!&quot;

&quot;Not nearly as beautiful as my darling Sakura-chan.&quot;

Blushing, Sakura retorted: &quot;Tomoyo-chan! Quit embarassing me!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you like my little ways of showing you my love?&quot; Asked Tomoyo 
while fake pouting and sticking out her bottom lip. Sakura sweatdropped.

*SIGH* &quot;What am I going to do with you?&quot;

&quot;I can think of many things!&quot; Flashes of her groping her wife&#39;s naked 
body and tying her to the bed went through Sakura&#39;s mind as Tomoyo 
thought out loud.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan!&quot;

Tomoyo laughed maniacally and said that she would wait until tommorow 
night to take her sweet Sakura-chan to bed and... She was cut off by 
Sakura&#39;s lips on her own. Tomoyo&#39;s body tensed up, but relaxed as the 
kiss grew more deep and passionate. They broke apart and took each other 
in another loving embrace.

&quot;I love you Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

&quot;I love you too Sakura-chan.&quot;

They slipped their hands together and headed back to bed. The next 
morning, Tomoyo again awoke to find Sakura gone.

&quot;I wish she wouldn&#39;t do that.&quot; Tomoyo grumbled.

She walked into the Kitchen and noticed that Sakura had already brewed 
the coffee. She heard a noise in the living room and headed over to see 
what it was. She stopped in the doorway and watched as Sakura tried to 
do some exercises. She picked up her camera from the table and started 
filming. Tomoyo giggled as she watched Sakura strain to perform some of 
the moves. She zoomed in on her butt as she bent over and tried to touch 
her toes. She snuck up behind her and flipped her nightie up to get a 
better view.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan!&quot; Sakura pouted while standing up. She noticed the camera 
too late as she crossed her arms and scolded Tomoyo for being so 
naughty.

&quot;You were filming that?! Gimmie that camera!&quot;

She lunged, but Tomoyo quickly stepped aside and smacked Sakura&#39;s butt 
as she almost fell over. Sakura grabbed for the camera, but Tomoyo put a 
hand on her head at arms length to stop her. She flung her arms wildly 
and struggled to reach as Tomoyo put the camera high above her head. Out 
of breath, she gave up and sat angrily on the couch. Tomoyo put her 
camera down and stood behind her. She put her arms around her and rested 
her head on Sakura&#39;s.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Sakura-chan. I was only teasing.&quot;

Sakura sighed and pushed Tomoyo&#39;s hands away. She stood up and spun 
around, grinning happily.

&quot;That&#39;s ok. I&#39;ll punish you for that later. Right now we&#39;d better get 
dressed, didn&#39;t you say you wanted to get there early?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right. I want to make sure we&#39;re there before the crowds.&quot;

They headed back to the room and got dressed. Tomoyo was wearing a very 
nice grey business suit with black stockings and a little red bow-tie. 
Her hair was tied back in a ponytail with little ribbons every two 
inches or so. Tomoyo helped Sakura with her outfit. It consisted of a 
yellow button up shirt with large silver buttons and two pockets with 
red flaps. Her skirt was a light blue with lots of frills that was, in 
her mind, way too short and stopped mid thigh. She also had on white 
stockings that stopped just short of her skirt.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan... this skirt is so tiny! I&#39;ll have to keep every little 
gust of wind from flipping it up!&quot;

&quot;But you look so cute! Besides... I know I wouldn&#39;t mind that.&quot;

Sakura blushed and put her hand behind her head as she laughed 
nervously. They got in the car and headed for Tomoyo&#39;s mothers. When 
they arrived, the three of them had breakfast and went over the schedule 
for the day. After having some delcious pastries Sonomi baked the night 
before, they piled in the Limo and headed for Tomoyo&#39;s store. Today was 
the day that they were releasing the new line of clothes. Sonomi and 
Tomoyo spared no expense in advertising their new clothes. Everywhere 
you looked, you would see a picture of Sakura modelling something new. 
They even talked her into modelling some underwear. Sakura was really 
embarassed when she saw an ad of herself in a white lace bra and cheeky 
panties on a billboard only blocks from her fathers house.

&quot;Hoeeeeeeee.&quot;
