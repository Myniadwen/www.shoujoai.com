<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/renchan.html">Ren-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I wake to the light touch of her foot against my own. I smile to myself
and turn around in my bed to stare at the beautiful face of my best
friend.  Her hands lay folded together on top of my pillow, gently
touching my nose.  I feel myself blush slightly by her touch. I sit up in
bed and stretch. I head to the windows and pull away the curtains allowing
the bright sunshine to poor into my room, greeting the new day.

She still feels comfortable sleeping in the same bed with me at sleepovers
like when we were children. All these years we&#39;ve been together, we&#39;ve
grown closer. I know her as if she were me and she knows me as if I was
herself.  But still, as I kneel next to her side, gazing longingly at her
sleeping face, she still doesn&#39;t know. She still doesn&#39;t understand. But
it&#39;s alright.  As long as I&#39;m with her, as long as I can make her happy,
see her happy, let me be there for her, it&#39;s alright. Even if she never
understands how much-

&quot;I love you, Sakura-chan,&quot; I whisper to her as I stroke her short, soft
brown hair. She smiles and stirs a bit in her sleep. She didn&#39;t hear me.  
She&#39;s such a deep sleeper. I wonder what she&#39;s dreaming about...

&quot;Tomoyo-chan..&quot;

I look at her bewildered. Did she just say my name in her sleep? I shake
my head to shrug out any hope of her loving me the way I love her. She is
going out with Li-kun, afterall. I supported their relationship, and still
do. He makes her happy and that&#39;s all I&#39;m concerned about. As long as
Sakura is happy-

&quot;Tomoyo-chan..&quot;

I stiffen as she repeats my name. Slowly her eyes open to see mine looking
over her. She slightly blushes as her eyes shine brightly even with my
shadow looming over her. She gives me the sweetest smile I&#39;ve ever seen
her give me. I melt inside with complete joy. I move back, tilting my head
down feeling my pale skin blush from head to toe.

&quot;Good morning, Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

&quot;Good morning, Sakura-chan.&quot;

She looked out the window and smiled happily. She hasn&#39;t changed a bit
since then. Sakura-chan is the same as we first met and through the times
of our adventures in capturing the Clow Cards, now turned Sakura Cards.
She is the Card Mistress. Her cards leap out of her bag and surround her
lovingly, greet- ing her good morning.

Kero-chan pokes his head out from the covers of the bed sitting up
yawning. He blinks his little, dot eyes as he floats from the bed. He
floats around muttering about how he wished he didn&#39;t wake up from his
great dream about giant cakes made of chocolate. The Sakura Cards float
back into the Book and float towards Kero, glowing brightly.

&quot;Good morning, Sakura. Good morning, Tomoyo. Ne, can we have breakfast?
Daidouji- san makes great pancakes! Oh, can she make the blueberry ones or
the banana ones? How about some strawberry shortcake, too?&quot; He continues
to babble about sweets while Sakura-chan and I smile at each other.

&quot;Hai. I&#39;ll ask her to make some as soon as she comes,&quot; I reply.

&quot;Wai! Wai!&quot; exclaims Kero-chan as he dances in the air in joy.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan, can I use the bathroom first? I won&#39;t take long.&quot;

I nod to her and watch her leave the room. I walk to my desk and pull out
one of my numerous sketch books with drawings of dresses and costumes.
Most of them with a detailed Sakura-chan wearing them. I sigh as I stare
at the recent sketch of her in a halter top complimenting her figure under
an open button-down, denim double-pocket breasted, short sleaved shirt.
With that she wears a matching cargo denim short shorts and knee high
combat boots. This is less extravagant than the costumes I used to make
for her as a Card Captor. Nowadays, I design a lot of everyday clothes
with Sakura as my model. She doesn&#39;t mind at all. That makes me extremely
happy. Sometimes she gets Li-kun to pose and try on some of the men&#39;s
designs I make. I am planning to go to the fashion a school, after all.
Men&#39;s clothes designs should be in my portfolio. I sit back in my chair
and stare at the sketch of Sakura-chan in complete awe.

&quot;That&#39;s a nice design. You got Sakura&#39;s features down perfect from head to
toe.&quot; I gasp startled, noticing Kero-chan hovering over my shoulder. I nod
to him as he studies my drawing. His face turns slightly serious. He folds
his arms, taking a deep breath. I look at him curiously, wondering what
he&#39;s thinking about.

&quot;Tomoyo,&quot; the guardian beast begins, &quot;I&#39;ve noticed how you look at
Sakura.&quot; He pauses as if he&#39;s choosing his words. &quot;I know how you feel
about Sakura.&quot;

I stare at him, slightly shocked. I take a deep breath and smile sadly,
not quite meeting his gaze. I know when I was younger I was pretty
obvious. All I ever did was tape her, draw her in flashy costumes, and
talk how cute and perfect Sakura was. I try to be more subtle now that she
has Li-kun. I don&#39;t want to burden her with my feelings.

&quot;I realized it awhile back. It&#39;s pretty obvious when you two were
younger.&quot; He pauses again and continues. &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have no
problems with it. If I did, I would&#39;ve consulted Sakura about it.&quot; I tense
up and look at him in fear at the idea that he could&#39;ve told her his
suspicions. &quot;Relax, I haven&#39;t said any- thing about it.&quot;

I sigh in relief. &quot;Thank you, Kero-chan. It means alot that you don&#39;t mind
about my feelings for Sakura and that you haven&#39;t told her about it.&quot;

The little beast hovers down, sitting on the desk. &quot;No problem. I&#39;m just
worried about you that&#39;s all. Sakura can be... oblivious to things like
that.&quot; He pauses again. &quot;I don&#39;t think Sakura would mind. She speaks
highly of you and holds you dear and stuff.&quot; Another pause, as if stopping
himself short from saying some- thing further. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t hold your
feelings against you.&quot;

I smile happily at that. I notice that he is starting to tense up.

&quot;Sakura is really involved with that brat.&quot; Another pause. &quot;I think he
knows, too. Don&#39;t get upset. I don&#39;t think he wants to touch the subject
either. But he knows you won&#39;t do anything to jeopordize their
relationship. Afterall, you got them together and supported them until
this day. He might say something to you about it. Err... Just don&#39;t think
about it.&quot;

The door opens to reveal Sakura-chan all freshened up. She smiles to the
both of us. She looks at my drawing with a little sweatdrop on her head.
She studies it more carefully and smiles.

&quot;You&#39;re really talented, Tomoyo-chan. I&#39;m flattered that you know my
features so well and make great clothes for me. I hope you get into that
art school you want. You make the best designs.&quot;

I blush slightly at her compliments as I smile brightly. &quot;Thank you so
much, it means alot to me.&quot;

She nods and begins to change behind me. I blush even more as I look away,
even though we&#39;ve changed in front of each other numerous times. &quot;So what
are we going to do today?&quot;

&quot;A picnic in the park with Syaoran. It&#39;s been awhile since we&#39;ve all been
to- gether. He&#39;s making lunch. We gotta be there at two so we can kill
some time in the shopping area right after breakfast.&quot; She turns to me and
holds my hands in hers. &quot;Please help me pick out a present for him for our
two-year anniversary. I know you&#39;re good at these things.&quot;

I smile, holding in the slight pain in my heart. Two years... Two years
they&#39;ve been going out. I brought them together. And she&#39;s smiling more
brightly since then. There&#39;s no way I could tell her how I feel. Li-kun is
going to be with us. Will he confront me after what Kero-chan said? &quot;Of
course, Sakura-chan. I&#39;ll help you.&quot;

She smiles brightly. &quot;Thank so much! I love you, Tomoyo!&quot; She hugs me
tight, then holds my hands again, tighter yet so gentle. &quot;I&#39;m so glad
you&#39;re my best friend.  You&#39;re always there for me. I don&#39;t how to make it
up to you.&quot;

I was about to say something just as we heard the door knob turn.
Kero-chan quickly does his stuff animal impression as the door opened to
reveal my mother on the other side. She smiled brightly just as she always
did when Sakura-chan came over. She loves her just about as much as I do
because she looks soo much like Nadeshiko-san. I look at her as she
notices Sakura-chan holding my hands.

&quot;Good morning, Tomoyo.&quot; she says happily to me with a conspiring wink.
&quot;Good morning, Sakura-chan. What do you two want for breakfast?&quot;

Mother wants me to be honest with her and try to win Sakura-chan&#39;s
feelings. I know she doesn&#39;t want me to end up like her and Nadeshiko-san.
But I won&#39;t, she&#39;s happy and secure with him. Mother will never understand
how much seeing Sakura happy makes me happy. I wouldn&#39;t have set them up
if I didn&#39;t think I could stand her being with another. Besides I know
he&#39;ll protect her and will take great care of her. &quot;Blueberry or banana
pancakes would be nice. Maybe some croissants and strawberry jelly.&quot;

She nods to me and grabs Sakura by the arm. &quot;Ok! Sakura-chan, why don&#39;t
you help me while Tomoyo gets ready? Don&#39;t take too long, ok?&quot; Mother
drags her down the hall insanely happy while I smile, glad that Mother
gets to spend time with Sakura as well. I know she misses Nadeshiko-san
everyday and seeing Sakura reminds her of her.

Kero-chan flies happily around the room as I quietly walk out the room
towards the bathroom. I begin to remember all the times I would tape
Sakura in her adventures, the late nights I spent making her costumes, and
all the times I tried to get her to understand my feelings. She&#39;s still as
dense as I remember. I also remember how I would root for Li-kun as he
tried to confess his feelings for Sakura.  Back then all I could think
about was Sakura in all her glory in my costumes capturing them on film
and getting her and Li-kun together so I could emerse myself in joy seeing
Sakura even more happy. But lately all I can do is imagine us together..
happy..

No, I have no magic to protect her like Li-kun has. How could I ever bear
her a beautiful child? What about her having a &quot;normal&quot; wedding? But I
love her just as much, possibly even more than Li-kun. Why am I thinking
about this? All that matters is Sakura happy. Why should I ask Sakura for
so much? Her friendship is enough.  I shake out any further thoughts of
doubt about Li-kun and Sakura-chan. I open the bathroom door and think
about what Sakura should give to Li-kun.

 * * *

Back in Tomoyo&#39;s room, Kero-chan flies around the room impatiently waiting
for food. For one minute he thinks of Clow Reed and sighs as he remembers
the things he had go through, comparing them with Sakura&#39;s situations.

&quot;Sigh..&quot;

Unknown to him, outside on the roof, is a transperant image of a smiling
Clow Reed and another transperant image of a woman with wings.

&quot;This is the last test, if it should even be called a test. But is this
really necessary?&quot; whispers Clow. The woman nods and smiles warmly as they
gradually fade into the morning light.
