<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>&quot;Water!&quot; Mei-lin yelled, the black haired young woman
unleashing the water card to sweep across the flames.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Sakura grinned, the flaming figure looking
startled as the brown haired woman readied her battle
staff. &quot;Spark,&quot; she cried, &quot;return to your power
confined!&quot;

The shimmering figure fought a moment, then willingly
surrendered as it flowed into a simple looking card
that dropped into Sakura&#39;s hand. On the front was a
young woman holding a small flame cupped protectively
in her hands.

&quot;It&#39;s pretty,&quot; Mei-lin admitted as she looked it over.

&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Sakura agreed as she tucked the card
away, &quot;it&#39;s the minor incarnation of the fire
element.&quot;

&quot;Minor incarnation?&quot; Mei-Lin blinked.

&quot;We&#39;ll have to face the full power of Fire later,&quot;
Sakura confessed. Pushing back her hood she grabbed
Mei-lin&#39;s hand, &quot;We&#39;d better hurry before someone
comes.&quot;

&quot;Calm down,&quot; Mei-lin said, though she was clearly not
bothered by Sakura holding her hand. &quot;Just walk slowly
away from the scene,&quot; she advised, &quot;panicked fleeing
just draws more attention to you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Sakura admitted as they left the side
street, glad that this neighborhood was mostly quiet
over night.

Mei-lin kept a firm hold of Sakura&#39;s hand as she
carefully guided them to a spot she knew, feeling a
slight thrill at the contact. &quot;Do you need to get back
home?&quot; she wondered, her simple red dress swirling
around her legs.

Even with her cloak on Sakura looked more boyish,
having chosen pants and a basic shirt to wear for
their quest to bring in a Clow Card. Despite the fact
she chose clothes for practicality, Sakura still
managed to look cute. &quot;Well, I need to sleep for work
tomorrow,&quot; Sakura admitted, &quot;but other than that...&quot;

&#39;Good,&#39; Mei-lin thought, &#39;she didn&#39;t mention going
home or to see Tomoyo...&#39; Aloud she said, &quot;Do you want
to get something to eat?&quot;

Almost on cue Sakura&#39;s stomach growled softly.
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she blushed faintly, &quot;I&#39;d love something to
eat.&quot;

&quot;Come on then,&quot; Mei-lin tugged on Sakura&#39;s hand as she
said, &quot;we&#39;re near Shinjuku and I know just the place!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tug,&quot; Sakura laughed, following.

It wasn&#39;t too obvious that there was even a club there
as Mei-lin led them up both up a flight of stairs a
few blocks later, both of them a bit out of breath
from tonight&#39;s exertions. Tucked away in a high rise
with a kareoke box and a manga store was a sign for
Lily&#39;s, up on the third floor and at the corner of the
building.

&quot;This is...?&quot; Sakura looked at her questioningly.

Mei-lin smiled gently as she opened the door and
repeated, &quot;Come on.&quot;

Inside was a small room, but carefully arranged for
the maximum space. Along the inside wall was a bar,
lined with people looking at them curiously, while up
against the windows small tables looked out at the
glittering city.

&quot;Hoeee...&quot; Sakura murmured softly as they passed by
the eyes of the women who filled the little club.

The blue haired woman at the bar smiled, her gestures
smooth and elegant. &quot;Good to see you, Mei-lin,&quot; she
said then dropped her voice, &quot;who&#39;s your cute friend?&quot;

&quot;This is my friend Sakura,&quot; Mei-lin smiled, &quot;Sakura,
this is my friend Umi, who runs this place with her
girlfriends Hikaru and Fuu.&quot;

&quot;Do you have to tell about my girlfriends?&quot; Umi
complained cheerfully, &quot;It completely spoils my chance
to pick up unwary girls.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s joking,&quot; Mei-lin reassured the mildly stunned
Sakura.

&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Umi agreed, &quot;I&#39;m pretty much harmless.&quot;
She turned to the assortment of drinks, &quot;What can I
get you?&quot;

&quot;Beer for me,&quot; Mei-lin said, then looked questioningly
at Sakura.

Sakura frowned slightly, &quot;Rum and coke, easy on the
rum.&quot;

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; Umi used the fountain to pour a
drink for Mei-lin then poured a bit of rum in a glass
and added coke.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mei-lin said, &quot;put it on my tab.&quot; She
lead the way to a window seat, where they looked out
over a busy road. &quot;I hope I haven&#39;t surprised you,&quot;
she said quietly.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Sakura smiled slightly as she said, &quot;but
mostly because I was expecting some little caf&eacute;, not
this...&quot;

&quot;Oops,&quot; Mei-lin blushed. &#39;Damn it,&#39; she thought, &#39;I
pushed her it seems.&#39; She looked at Sakura, &quot;So you&#39;re
not shocked?&quot;

Sakura actually chuckled softly as she took a drink,
&quot;I work in a museum. I deal with gay and lesbian
artists all the time.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; and with that Mei-lin reached over to take her
hand.

Sakura met her eyes questioningly, &quot;Mei-lin?&quot;

Giving into the urge Mei-lin leaned forward a bit,
gently pressing her lips to Sakura&#39;s in answer to her
question. To her dismay she felt Sakura stiffen up
then pull back, and both sat there awkwardly a moment
in silence.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Mei-lin finally said.

Sakura was blushing furiously, &quot;Mei-lin, I didn&#39;t
realize...&quot;

&#39;God she&#39;s innocent,&#39; Mei-lin sighed, realizing that
Sakura had been entirely unaware of Mei-lin&#39;s feelings
towards her. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she made herself say,
even though she felt like she had been punched in the
gut.

Sakura sighed softly, &quot;This time I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She
looked up, &quot;How long...?&quot;

&quot;Have I had a crush on you?&quot; Mei-lin finished. She
shrugged, &quot;A few weeks.&quot;

&quot;I feel very stupid right now,&quot; Sakura admitted.

&quot;Not your fault,&quot; Mei-lin said as she smoothly
finished her beer. Noticing that Sakura was done her
rum and coke she rose, &quot;Wanna get out of here?&quot;

&quot;Can we get a sandwich to go?&quot; Sakura asked
plaintively.

Mei-lin had to smile, &quot;Sure.

&quot;Leaving so soon?&quot; Umi asked, her expression
sympathetic.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mei-lin shrugged uncomfortably as she put in a
order for two sandwiches to go.

Handing the bag over a few moments later Umi softly
said, &quot;Don&#39;t be a stranger, I&#39;m sure Hikaru and Fuu
would love to see you.&quot;

They went down the stairs in silence, then Mei-lin
unwrapped the sandwiches and passed one to Sakura.
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Sakura said as she took a bite, &quot;do you know
Umi well?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve been friends for a while,&quot; Mei-lin admitted as
she munched her own food. She looked at Sakura
hesitantly, &quot;This isn&#39;t going to stop you from working
with me, will it?&quot;

Saukra reached out and squeezed Mei-lin&#39;s shoulder as
she promised, &quot;Of course not.&quot;

Mei-lin was good at reading people, and she was glad
to see no nervousness or fear in Sakura&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;m
glad,&quot; she smiled.</pre>
