Tomoyo smiled gently at her friend. &quot;I thought you might want to see 
it.&quot;

&quot;But what is it?&quot;

The dark-haired girl shrugged. &quot;I thought you might be able to answer 
that.&quot;

Sakura cocked her head inquisitively. &quot;You think it&#39;s a Card?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s why I asked you to come over.&quot;

The two girls stood looking at the pond in Tomoyo&#39;s back yard. The koi 
swam calmly through the water; the light breeze creating relaxed 
ripples across the surface. But it wasn&#39;t the pool that drew their 
attention &#150; it was the phenomenon above it.

Sonomi stepped out into the yard. &quot;What are you girls...?&quot; she 
stopped, her mouth dropping open in surprise. &quot;What on earth is that?&quot;

Tomoyo turned with a smile for her mother. &quot;I don&#39;t know &#150; it was 
there when I came home from school. It&#39;s pretty, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Sonomi smiled. &quot;It is! I think this deserves cake to celebrate! Stay 
here and I&#39;ll be right back!&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t leave it there, can we?&quot; Sakura asked, her voice tinged with 
just a hint of sadness.

Tomoyo said nothing. With a quick look at Sakura, she reached over and 
took the other girl&#39;s hand.

&quot;Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo began, her voice serious. &quot;Can you capture this 
card before my mother gets back?&quot;

Sakura looked at the hand that held hers and Tomoyo&#39;s serious face. &quot;I 
think so, but why?&quot;

The dark-haired girl blushed slightly. &quot;Because this is such a 
beautiful moment &#150; and I want to share it with you. Just you and me.&quot; 
She looked into Sakura&#39;s green eyes and smiled, as she saw them 
soften.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan!&quot; Sakura said quietly. &quot;I&#39;ll do it for you.&quot;

Sakura reached around her neck and pulled out the little key that hung 
on a chain. Holding it in the palm of her free hand, she spoke quietly 
to it. In a shower of color that mingled with the lights shimmering 
above the pond, the key expanded to its full form.

Sakura took the staff in one hand, then wrapped Tomoyo&#39;s hand around 
the wand, covering it with her own. For a full minute, the two girls 
watched the spectacle glimmer and flash, a private fireworks display 
for their eyes only. 

&quot;Return to your original form, Clow Card!&quot; Sakura spoke reluctantly 
and the wand came down to touch the ethereal card that formed mid-air. 

To their surprise, the lights did not dissipate, but moved closer to 
them, settling over their heads. Tomoyo and Sakura, hands still 
clasped around the staff, laughed as they settled in their hair, on 
their ears and fluttered by their cheeks, like fireflies of fabulous 
colors.

Caressing their faces softly, the lights passed around the girls, 
becoming the magic card at the end of the wand.

When the card had fully formed, it swirled through the air over the 
pond and landed just above their clasped hands.

Tomoyo glanced at Sakura who nodded. Tentatively, she reached out and 
took the card in her hand, passing it over to the Card Captor with a 
bright smile.

With a final squeeze of Sakura&#39;s hand, Tomoyo moved away, just as 
Sonomi joined them. The older woman shot a brief, puzzled look at the 
pond, then the girls. &quot;What happened to the lights?&quot;

Tomoyo shrugged eloquently and took the tray of drinks from her 
mother&#39;s hands. &quot;They seem to have disappeared.&quot;

Sakura reached out and took Sonomi&#39;s hand in hers, leading the older 
woman after Tomoyo to the table that overlooked the garden. &quot;It must 
have been a trick of the light,&quot; she agreed pleasantly.

Later, when she and Tomoyo were again alone, the two friends looked at 
the card once more. They smiled as they thanked the festive lights and 
smiled again as they read the card name.

&quot;The Sparkle,&quot; they said, and laughed.
