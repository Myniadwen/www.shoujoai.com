<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 19 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>&quot;All right,&quot; Sonomi Daidouji demanded as they stood
in her beautifully decorated library room, &quot;how long
has this been going on?&quot; The books lining the shelves,
fireplace and all the soft chairs would have normally
given the room a cozy feel, but Sonomi&#39;s intense
manner rather killed that effect.

&quot;I think that&#39;s my line, love,&quot; Kaho Mitsuki pointed
out mildly, the newspaper editor standing beside her
simmering lover.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Sonomi actually smiled slightly as she said,
&quot;but she&#39;s my daughter first, your reporter second.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d agree with that,&quot; Tomoyo said
dryly from where she was sitting on a couch to one
side of the room, meeting her mother&#39;s eyes with a
flash of resentment.

Sonomi winced at that shot.

&quot;Tomoyo,&quot; Sakura Kinomoto put a hand on her arm,
squeezing it gently. &quot;This is all my fault,&quot; she
looked away from her friend to meet Kaho and Sonomi&#39;s
eyes as she lied boldly, &quot;I made her conceal my
identity.&quot;

&quot;She did not,&quot; Tomoyo frowned.

&quot;But...&quot; Sakura started.

&quot;Don&#39;t try taking all the fault on yourself,&quot; Mei-lin
Li added from where she was sitting in a chair nearby.

&quot;You&#39;re involved with this too?&quot; Sonomi frowned.

&quot;Hold it,&quot; Kaho raised a hand. Looking at both of
them she said, &quot;Could someone please start at the
begining?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Sakura sighed. With some help
from Tomoyo and Mei-Lin she sketched in the ongoing
fight to capture the Clow cards, as well as hunting
the monsters that seemed to haunt Tokyo.

&quot;You said you inherited this,&quot; Sonomi gave Sakura a
searching look, &quot;does that mean your mother Nadesico
did this, too?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she did,&quot; Sakura confirmed, deciding to mention
that she had died in action. She rather thought Sonomi
wouldn&#39;t want to know.

&quot;And exactly how long were you planning to sit on
this story?&quot; Kaho coldly asked after a few moments,
hands on her hips as she stared down at Tomoyo.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t sitting on it,&quot; Tomoyo answered her with
just a little smile, &quot;just... leaving out certain
facts.&quot;

&quot;Those are pretty big facts,&quot; Kaho bit out.

&quot;The problem is,&quot; Mei-Lin noted calmly before they
could say things they might regret later, &quot;would
people believe it anyway?&quot; As everyone looked at her
she continued, &quot;As it is there are a regular stream of
letters coming in claiming all our Knight stories are
just a hoax.&quot; She spread out her hands, &quot;What are they
going to do when we reveal that she&#39;s really a young
woman who is a hereditary monster slayer?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;d never believe it,&quot; Sonomi admitted after a
second.

Kaho looked like she had a headache coming on. &quot;That
doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t obligated to report it,&quot; she
said.

&quot;How about journalistic responsibility?&quot; Sakura
countered. &quot;The only thing revealing the full truth
will do is cause a panic as people discovers that
there are real monsters out there, ones that only
someone like me can stop.&quot;

&quot;And has anyone tried shooting at these things?&quot;
Sonomi asked curiously.

&quot;According to the stories my Grandmother did when she
was knight,&quot; Sakura paused, &quot;she was mauled so badly
her leg never recovered.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Mei-Lin winced.

&quot;Revealing the truth will do nobody any good,&quot; Tomoyo
met Kaho&#39;s eyes in a silent plea, &quot;all it will do is
make Sakura&#39;s job even harder.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Kaho finaly gave up with a sigh, &quot;we&#39;ll
sit on the information on Sakura being this Knight.&quot;
As everyone was looking relieved she added, &quot;But, if
the situation escalates I am not making any promises.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Sakura nodded.

&quot;Well, it looks like the party&#39;s finished,&quot; Sonomi
sighed, then smiled wryly. In the chaos of Water&#39;s
appearance the guests and staff had fled, leaving a
disaster outside with toppled tables, spilled food and
wrecked decorations.

&quot;Is there any sign of your catering staff?&quot; Tomoyo
asked, quite willingly accepting the change of topic.

Sonomi shrugged, &quot;I assume they headed for the hills
with everyone else.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Sakura got up, offering Tomoyo a hand as she
said practically, &quot;maybe we should try to clean up a
bit?&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Tomoyo agreed, willing to seize on any
opportunity to get away from her mother, not to
mention her annoyed boss.

&quot;I&#39;ll help too,&quot; Mei-Lin joined them, casting a wary
eye at her boss.

&quot;Thanks for not jumping in to the argument to protect
Sakura&#39;s identity.&quot; Kaho said as they watched the
three young ladies righting tables and carefully using
utensils to scoop up the ruined food.

&quot;I was tempted,&quot; Sonomi admitted. She gave Kaho a
ghost of a smile, &quot;But I figured that with three to
one odds, they&#39;d do pretty well.&quot;

Kaho laughed, &quot;True enough.&quot; Thoughtfully she added,
&quot;Sakura... she seems to inspire a fierce loyalty in
her friends.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Sonomi said, &quot;she has a innocent sort of
charisma.&quot;

Just then Sakura took a splat of potato salad to the
side of the head. Tomoyo tooked mortified, then
stunned as Sakura beaned her with a dinner roll. She
successfully ducked the sandwich Tomoyo tossed but
poor Mei-Lin didn&#39;t dodge in time. Within moments a
full on food fight was going on, the ladies ducking
behind tables as they rooted about for ammo.

&quot;And on the other hand they&#39;re ordinary women, too.&quot;
Kaho laughed softly, &quot;Do you want to go break them
up?&quot;

Laughing too Sonomi lead they way, &quot;Break it up, I
thought you were going to....&quot;

Splat!

&quot;Oops,&quot; Mei-Lin dropped the spoon, the bowl of rice
sitting beside her.

&quot;Why you,&quot; Sonomi snatched up a fish and joined the
fray.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll just sit over here and watch,&quot; Kaho
quietly backed away as the four way food fight
continued on.</pre>
