<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 2 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>        Sakura leapt up to dodge a strike, keeping a firm grip on her 
staff as she quickly assessed her latest opponent. The thing was big, 
nearly as tall as three men, it&#39;s body bulky and almost rocky in 
appearance. It&#39;s eyes glowed scarlet, piercing in the night.

        &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Yukito asked, clicking away with his 
camera.

        &quot;What in the..&quot; Sakura turned in surprise, not having heard 
their arrival. A backhand blow from the creature sent her flying away, 
hammering her into a brick wall nearby the two newspaper reporters, 
where she slid limply to the ground.

        &quot;No,&quot; Tomoyo murmured as she ran towards her. &quot;Sakura?&quot; she 
looked down at her in surprise, offering a hand to pull her to her feet.

        &quot;Hooee?&quot; Sakura blinked up at her dazedly.

        &quot;Sakura, are you all right?&quot; Yukito cried as he ran over.

        Sakura shook her head, trying to clear the cobwebs. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; 
she used Tomoyo&#39;s hand to pull herself up, swaying just a bit. The 
creature ran at them again and Sakura shoved the others backwards with a 
cry, &quot;Get behind me!&quot;

        A muscled arm came down only to be blocked by that odd, bird 
designed staff. They stood there frozen for a moment, the creature 
straining to crush Sakura, then the slim brown haired heaved with her 
shoulders to send the monster staggering away.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t want to use this,&quot; Sakura drew the ornately designed 
card from beneath her cloak, &quot;but you leave me with no choice.&quot; She held 
still for a second, the black clad figure oddly meditative, then she 
tossed it up into the air.

        &quot;What is she..?&quot; Tomoyo blinked.

        &quot;Windy card!&quot; Sakura brought her bird designed staff down onto 
the card, light flaring brightly as she continued, &quot;Become the chain of 
punishment and bind my enemy. Windy!&quot;

        The card almost seemed to explode as a figure made up of mist 
and air rose up, a gorgeous but dangerous female figure made of the very 
air itself. She paused, giving them a regal glance, a slight smile 
appearing on her face as she gazed at Sakura. Then she turned, swooping 
down on the creature and binding it with her substance, forming bonds of 
solid air.

        Even as Windy struck Sakura was on the move. She ran at the 
creature, grabbing the base of her staff and twisting slightly. With a 
steely hiss she drew forth a silvery blade, the bird&#39;s head on the 
handle becoming the sword&#39;s hilt, even as she leapt. A single downward 
stroke of the weapon, a burst of black blood, and it was over.

        The Windy swirled about Sakura and the much that had splattered 
the cloak and black clothing was simply gone. A gentle hand was pressed 
to the side of Sakura&#39;s face and it was gone, the card falling to settle 
into Sakura&#39;s hands once more.

        &quot;Incredible,&quot; Yukito managed, so stunned that he hadn&#39;t even 
been taking any photos.

        &quot;Are you two all right?&quot; Sakura asked, sliding the sword back 
into it&#39;s concealment then closing it with a soft click.

        &quot;What was that thing?&quot; Tomoyo asked, quickly recovering from her 
shock. &quot;Where did it come from? How did you do that to stop it?&quot;

        &quot;And what size underwear do you wear?&quot; Yukito quipped, receiving 
a glare from Tomoyo. The sound of police sirens rang through the alley 
and he looked over at his two companions to ask, &quot;Think we should get 
out of here?&quot;

        &quot;Would you mind giving me a ride home?&quot; Sakura said with a 
slight smile, &quot;When we get there I&#39;ll explain what I know.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Tomoyo lead the way to the car. Yukito got into the 
back seat, Sakura grabbing the passenger side as Tomoyo started up the 
vehicle. They roared off, not too long before they began to pass police 
vehicles hurrying the way they came.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Sakura sighed softly.

        The young woman reached up, unclipping the clasp of her cloak at 
her throat and then folding it up on her lap. Sakura held the staff 
awkwardly in her hands, then she concentrated visibly. The staff 
shimmered, glowing in the dim light of the car, then in began to shrink. 
In a few moments it was simply a key that hung from a necklace around 
her neck.

        &#39;She could use a nicer costume,&#39; Tomoyo noted, taking in the 
plain black clothes Sakura wore, &#39;though it is cute.&#39; Tomoyo froze, 
&#39;What am I thinking?&#39;

        &quot;Wow,&quot; Yukito spoke up from the back seat, &quot;that&#39;s pretty cool.&quot; 
He paused a moment, &quot;How long have you been doing this sort of thing?&quot;

        &quot;A couple of years now,&quot; Sakura said simply.

        Tomoyo narrowed her eyes thoughtfully. &quot;That makes sense,&quot; she 
murmured, &quot;there were stories about a midnight adventurer years back, 
then they just stopped. And now you.. huh.&quot; She looked at Sakura 
curiously, &quot;What happened to your predecessor, did she retire?&quot;

        Sakura swallowed visibly, her eyes closing tightly as if she 
felt a deep pain. &quot;No,&quot; she finally said softly, &quot;she died.&quot;

        Tomoyo&#39;s mouth went dry, she opened up her mouth but nothing 
came out. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Yukito spoke up from the back seat.

        Tomoyo pulled the car in front of the little house, the address 
she had memorized from the briefing papers she had read about Sakura 
this morning. Sakura opened up the passenger side, &quot;Come on inside, and 
we&#39;ll talk.&quot;

        &#39;She looks so sad,&#39; Tomoyo thought, &#39;and oddly familiar, 
somehow. And not just from this morning.&#39; She followed Sakura to the 
front door, Yukito following behind her. As Sakura was unlocking the 
door Yukito put a hand on her arm. &quot;Yes?&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re not planning to write a story on this, are you?&quot; Yukito 
asked softly.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Tomoyo admitted softly, &quot;who&#39;d believe any of 
this?&quot; The door was open and the two of them followed Sakura inside. She 
slipped her shoes off, then they went on into the little kitchen where 
Sakura waved them over to the seats.

        &quot;I know Yukito is probably hungry,&quot; Sakura walked over to the 
cupboards, &quot;do you want anything, Ms. Daidouji?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s Tomoyo,&quot; she said softly, thinking of something Sakura had 
said earlier, &quot;when someone says Ms. Daidouji I always look around for 
my Mother.&quot;

        &quot;Fair enough, Tomoyo,&quot; Sakura agreed, laying a plate of biscuits 
down in front of Yukito, then putting a bottle of iced tea down beside 
it. &quot;I&#39;m not quite sure where to start,&quot; she admitted, sitting down 
across from Tomoyo.

        &quot;How did you get involved with all this?&quot; Tomoyo asked 
curiously.

        From a pocket in her black shirt Sakura drew out two cards, 
laying them on the table. She unclipped her necklace, laying it atop the 
cards as she said, &quot;You could say that I inherited it. These belonged to 
my mother, until she died.&quot;

        Yukito&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Your mother died doing something like 
this?&quot; He frowned, &quot;But Yukito told me she died in a car crash.&quot;

        &quot;It was the best story we could come up with, my father and I,&quot; 
Sakura toyed with the little key absentmindedly. &quot;He felt so guilty 
about his decision to let her continue as the Knight after she had Toya 
and I that he asked me not to take up the job,&quot; she explained.

        &quot;You&#39;re obviously doing this now,&quot; Tomoyo pointed out gently.

        &quot;The duty has been passed from mother and daughter for 
generations,&quot; Sakura explained, &quot;I couldn&#39;t just turn my back on it. 
Instead, I waited until I moved out of my father&#39;s home before I took it 
the task of being the Knight of Clow.&quot;

        &quot;Clow,&quot; Yukito looked up in surprise from his plate of cookies, 
&quot;wasn&#39;t that the man you mentioned over at the museum?&quot;

        &quot;Clow Reed,&quot; Sakura agreed. She held up the two cards, &quot;He 
created these Clow Cards, and he also used them to made certain 
predictions about the future.&quot;

        Tomoyo looked over at her thoughtfully before quietly saying, 
&quot;Why do I get the feeling I&#39;m not going to like the sound of this?&quot;

        Sakura chuckled softly, &quot;I know I didn&#39;t.&quot; More seriously she 
continued, &quot;Clow claimed that if the Cards weren&#39;t restored to their 
sacred chamber, a great disaster would befall the world.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re mother&#39;s name, it wasn&#39;t Nadeshiko, was it?&quot; Tomoyo 
asked softly into the moment of silence that followed that statement. At 
Sakura&#39;s surprised nod Tomoyo smiled slightly, &quot;My mother, Sonomi, 
always talks about her cousin Nadeshiko, and has pictures all over of 
her.&quot;

        &quot;You two are related?&quot; Yukito blinked in surprise, looking 
between the dark haired girl and the brown haired one.

        &quot;I never knew,&quot; Sakura blinked in surprise.

        &quot;I won&#39;t write a story on this,&quot; Tomoyo admitted, &quot;at least, not 
yet.&quot; She fixed Sakura with an intense gaze, &quot;But I want two things in 
return.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Sakura frowned.

        &quot;One,&quot; Tomoyo held up a finger, &quot;I want to cover whatever you 
do. I just won&#39;t use your name.&quot; She held up another finger, &quot;And two, I 
want to design you a new costume.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Sakura looked at her in surprise.</pre>
