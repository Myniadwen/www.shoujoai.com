<h1>Sakura Lemon (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaitouace.html">KaitouAce</a><br> </h2>
<pre>     Sakura sat on the expansive bed in Tomoyo&#39;s room.  No matter
how many times she saw it, the Daidouji estate always impressed
her.  She looked around, dazed, until Tomoyo&#39;s sweet voice
brought her back to reality.
     &quot;Sakura-chan.  I&#39;ve brought tea.&quot;
     Sakura jumped at her sudden appearance.
     &quot;Oh!  Tomoyo-chan!  Thank you.&quot;
     Tomoyo just smiled at her as she set the tea tray she was
carrying on a nearby table.  She stared at Sakura for a few
seconds.  Puzzled, Sakura questioned her friend.
     &quot;What is it?&quot;
     &quot;Oh.  I was just wondering where Kero-chan is.&quot;
     &quot;Kero-chan?  He didn&#39;t want to wake up so I let him sleep.&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s too bad.  I brought extra cake for him.&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s OK.  I&#39;ll bring him some.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be grateful.&quot;
     They stared at each other, then laughed together as they
started tea.
     Somewhere across town, Kero-chan sneezed and mumbled in his
sleep, with only one word audible.
     &quot;Mmmmm . . . cake . . . &quot;

     Sakura stretched after tea, her T-shirt coming out of her
skirt and showing her belly button as she folded backwards.
Tomoyo eyed her with a slight smile on her face. Sakura glanced
at her sideways and noticed her gaze.  She immediately became
worried and defensive.
     &quot;What?!?  I&#39;m not gaining weight!  I&#39;m the same size I
always am!&quot;
     Tomoyo giggled as she stood up, smoothing the wrinkles out
of her dark blue party dress.
     &quot;I didn&#39;t mean that at all.  I was just . . . admiring you.&quot;
     &quot;Hoeh?&quot; (You know this sound.)
     Tomoyo closed her eyes and faced the floor.
     &quot;You&#39;re always so cheerful and full of energy.  Nothing ever
gets you down for long.  I, on the other hand . . . &quot;
     Sakura was surprised by the sudden subject and jumped to
Tomoyo&#39;s defense.
     &quot;You&#39;re great too!  Always calm, never afraid like me.  And
smart too . . . &quot;
     Tomoyo continued a little more anxiously.  &quot;But now you&#39;re a
Card Captor. You&#39;re . . . so important!  Sometimes I think . . .
I&#39;m just a liability.  I don&#39;t have magic and can&#39;t fight.  And
with Lee-kun to help you . . . making costumes just doesn&#39;t seem
like much help anymore.&quot;
     Sakura was shocked when Tomoyo put her face in her hands and
started crying.  All this time she&#39;d known her and had barely
ever seen her sad, much less crying.  She ran to her friend and
threw her arms around her, doing her best to comfort her.
     &quot;Don&#39;t cry Tomoyo-chan.  You&#39;re the best friend I could ever
have.  You&#39;re a great help and . . . I hope you want to keep
helping me.&quot;
     Sakura was surprised when she started tearing up as well,
but couldn&#39;t stand the thought of Tomoyo not being with her.
Tomoyo stopped crying when she heard Sakura sniffling.
     &quot;Oh, Sakura-chan!  I didn&#39;t mean to make you cry.&quot;
     Tomoyo released Sakura and wiped her eyes.  Sakura followed
suit.  After a short silence they smiled and started laughing
again, the depressing situation apparently forgotten.  Tomoyo,
feeling more at ease, put on her usual beaming smile.
     &quot;Sakura-chan . . . sorry for that.&quot;
     Sakura shook her head violently.  &quot;Nuh unh.  I&#39;m just glad
you&#39;re OK.&quot;
     Tomoyo smiled, then got a questionable look on her face.
She fumbled with her hand.
     &quot;Sakura-chan?&quot;
     &quot;Huh?&quot;
     &quot;You don&#39;t mind if I . . . &quot;
     Sakura looked down at Tomoyo&#39;s hands and wondered how she
didn&#39;t see that tape measure before.  She sighed in disbelief but
complied, figuring it would help cheer Tomoyo up.


     Sakura stood in the middle of the room with her arms out as
Tomoyo happily flew around her body, making mental notes about
what fabric she should use next.  But in her mind, she was still
thinking about what she had said to Sakura.  Her pace slowed as
she ended up behind Sakura.  As she stretched the measure across
Sakura&#39;s back, she spoke quietly.
     &quot;You really don&#39;t mind me doing this?&quot;
     Sakura once again shook her head while trying to stay still.
But Tomoyo wasn&#39;t so easily convinced.
     &quot;I know I annoy you all the time with this.  It . . . it&#39;s
just the only I know how to help.&quot;
     Sakura breathed deeply and spoke to her unseen friend.
     &quot;You know . . . I do all this for a reason.  Wearing your
costumes, trying out all your gifts . . . &quot;
     Tomoyo braced herself for the truth she knew was eventually
coming.
     Undaunted, Sakura continued.  &quot;I . . . I always wanted you
with me.&quot;
     Tomoyo froze, her measuring tape slowly falling to the
floor.
     &quot;I figured if I wasn&#39;t completely with all your ideas, you
wouldn&#39;t be interested in being my friend.  Don&#39;t get me wrong.
I like everything about you and your costumes are great.  I was
just worried that someone as smart and talented as you . . .
might not want to hang out with me.&quot;
     Tomoyo felt her tears returning and suddenly broke her
stillness, embracing her best friend.
     &quot;Oh Sakura-chan!&quot;
     Sakura relaxed and felt her friend from behind, holding her
hands which surrounded her.  Tomoyo held Sakura as close as she
could.  She felt so much love for her friend she could hardly
contain herself.  All she wanted was to let her know how happy
she felt.
     Tomoyo immediately thought of a way.  But she couldn&#39;t do
that.  She could jeopardize everything that just happened today.
But she loved Sakura so much.  This was her most intimate secret
and she desperately wanted to share it with her friend.  She
didn&#39;t want to take the chance but she just . . . just KNEW her
best friend would understand her.  But even as she was trying to
decide if it was right or not, her body was already in motion.
     Sakura was getting a little stiff from standing in the same
place for so long, so she was relieved when Tomoyo moved her
arms.  But before she could turn around, she felt Tomoyo&#39;s small
hand slide across her stomach.  Sakura stared down at it and
wondered what was going on.  Tomoyo once again increased her hold
on Sakura as her other hand moved past the edge of Sakura&#39;s
skirt.  Sakura whispered meekly as she slowly realized what
Tomoyo was doing to her.
     &quot;Tomoyo-chan . . . &quot;
     Tomoyo only answered by leaning her head behind Sakura&#39;s to
get more leverage as her left hand slipped Sakura&#39;s shirt higher,
allowing her contact with her skin, and her right moved to the
inside of Sakura&#39;s leg and started to travel upward.  Sakura
tried to move but was powerless under Tomoyo&#39;s loving hands.  Her
mind was full of many images.  What would her brother and father
think if they found out?  What about her friends at school,
Kero-chan, Yukito-san?  Why couldn&#39;t she stop this . . . or why
wouldn&#39;t she?  Suddenly all the images wiped away as Tomoyo&#39;s
hands finished their respective journeys.  Sakura could feel
Tomoyo&#39;s left hand brushing across her tiny nipples, slightly
tugging them every now and then, and her right hand caressing her
inner thigh, occasionally fingering the frill on the edge of her
panties.  Tomoyo slowly moved her head to Sakura&#39;s ear, her lips
perilously close to touching.  Her next sentence came out as a
whisper.  &quot;I love you Sakura-chan.  Please let me make you feel
good.&quot;
     Sakura visibly trembled when she heard those words.  She
wanted to run but part of her couldn&#39;t do that.  She didn&#39;t
understand why.  Tomoyo saw her uneasiness and whispered once
again.
     &quot;Don&#39;t worry.  I won&#39;t hurt you.  Please trust me.&quot;
     Sakura seemed to relax at those words.  She didn&#39;t know what
this would lead to, but she trusted Tomoyo completely.  With her
life if need be.  Sakura released some of her tension as Tomoyo
slowly led Sakura to the bed.  As Tomoyo felt the bed behind her,
she stopped and sweetly whispered again.  &quot;Sakura-chan, put up
your arms.&quot;
     Sakura did so without thinking, being so used to being
measured.  Suddenly, Tomoyo grabbed the bottom of her T-shirt and
pulled it over Sakura&#39;s head, dropping it to the floor.  Sakura
looked down to where the shirt she once wore now laid.  While she
was preoccupied, she felt her shirt leave her waist, falling down
her legs softly to the floor.  Sakura was suddenly very aware of
her nudity.  Only her panties clothed her.  She crossed her arms
over her small chest and looked ashamedly to the floor, blushing
profusely.  Tomoyo put her hands on Sakura&#39;s arms, realizing her
embarrassment even though she couldn&#39;t see her face.
     &quot;Don&#39;t be ashamed Sakura-chan.  I&#39;m with you.&quot;
     Hearing Tomoyo&#39;s words eased Sakura once again, her arms
unfolding and going to her sides.  Tomoyo enveloped her waist and
slowly pulled her onto the bed, where she nervously sat with
Tomoyo embracing her from behind.  Tomoyo stared at Sakura&#39;s
beautiful, smooth back as long as she could stand.  She slowly
moved back to Sakura&#39;s head and whispered her name.  Tomoyo&#39;s
warm breath on her neck made Sakura&#39;s hair stand on end.  She
wasn&#39;t ready for this, but did nothing except to close her eyes
and wait.  Tomoyo inched closer and slowly enveloped Sakura&#39;s
earlobe with her lips.  Sakura&#39;s body jolted in surprise as she
felt her ear being tugged, pulled, and even licked.  As Tomoyo
caressed Sakura&#39;s ear, her left hand once again sought out
Sakura&#39;s breast.  As she brushed her hand across Sakura&#39;s young
chest, she smiled as she noticed Sakura&#39;s nipple slightly
hardening.  She lightly pinched and tugged it for a bit, then ran
her finger around it closely, slowly making circles.  Sakura&#39;s
breathing became heavier as her body started to succumb to
Tomoyo&#39;s actions.  Tomoyo then began to run her finger ever so
lightly back and forth across Sakura&#39;s now erect nipple.  The
sensation was too much as Sakura finally broke her silence,
moaning softly.  Tomoyo smiled upon hearing that and moved her
lips from Sakura&#39;s ear to her neck as she began to lightly kiss
it, occasionally sucking or licking it.  By now, Sakura was
starting to feel much more comfortable with the situation.  She
settled herself deeply in Tomoyo&#39;s lap becoming totally
submissive as her best friend pleasured her in ways she hadn&#39;t
thought possible.  Sensing Sakura&#39;s newfound acceptance, Tomoyo
decided to get more serious.  Sakura&#39;s eyes, which were closed,
letting the sensations flow through her body, shot open as she
felt Tomoyo&#39;s hand once again slowly slide up her thigh.  Sakura
held her breath in anticipation.  Tomoyo once again stopped just
before the area where skin meets cloth.  There she stayed, toying
with Sakura who was becoming more anxious.  She began twitching
slightly and pushing into Tomoyo who only smiled at her friend&#39;s
frustration.  Seeing this was getting her nowhere, Sakura
actually pleaded with her friend, almost whining.
     &quot;Tomoyo-chan . . . please.&quot;
     Tomoyo smiled and replied.
     &quot;Eh?  Please what, Sakura-chan?&quot;
     &quot;Please . . . touch me.&quot;
     &quot;Touch you where?&quot;
     Sakura grew more desperate as she answered.
     &quot;THERE!  Please.&quot;
     Tomoyo smiled and whispered in Sakura&#39;s ear.
     &quot; . . . Help me.&quot;
     Sakura slowly reached for Tomoyo&#39;s arm and touched her
elbow.  She caressed it back and forth with her middle and index
fingers, causing Tomoyo to shudder slightly.  Sakura then
encircled Tomoyo&#39;s arm and slowly moved down toward her wrist.
Tomoyo&#39;s spine shivered at the lightness of Sakura&#39;s touch.  Her
wish was to pleasure Sakura but at this rate her own body may
need release as well.  And before she realized it, Sakura&#39;s hand
was gliding over her own, tenderly urging her to go the final
step.  As Sakura&#39;s and Tomoyo&#39;s hand crossed the threshold,
Sakura wondered if she was doing the right thing.  But her mind
went blank the second Tomoyo&#39;s hand touched that soft, white
fabric.  They both stood still, keeping silent as they thought
about what they had just done.  Tomoyo was a little reluctant
about continuing but Sakura had come too far to stop now.  She
suddenly closed her hand over Tomoyo&#39;s causing her to grasp her
crotch firmly.
     &quot;Tomoyo-chan!&quot;
     Hearing Sakura&#39;s cry of approval steeled Tomoyo&#39;s resolve.
She held Sakura close as she slowly rubbed her sweet softness.
Sakura leaned her head back and moaned as she felt her body get
hotter.  Tomoyo&#39;s pressure and speed increased, causing Sakura to
writhe and squirm in her friend&#39;s grasp.  Her hips began bucking
as she tried to grind herself on Tomoyo&#39;s hand.  Sakura was on
the edge.  She felt as if the world was about to stop.  She
prepared herself for the climax . . . and Tomoyo stopped.  Sakura
was left standing alone on the cliff.  She was speechless for a
moment, then pleaded to her friend.
     &quot;No . . . don&#39;t stop!  Don&#39;t . . . &quot;
     Sakura&#39;s eyes widened as she looked at her dampened panties
. . . and that Tomoyo was going underneath them.  Sakura was
frantic.
     &quot;No!  Tomoyo-chan, please!  I . . . &quot;
     Her voice trailed off as Tomoyo&#39;s finger slid lightly along
the slit of her nether region.  After a moment, Sakura purred
loudly, the sensations magnified with direct contact.
     &quot;I . . . uhh . . . unhhh . . . ooooohhhh!&quot;
     Tomoyo smiled and continued rubbing Sakura.  The feeling of
Tomoyo&#39;s hand on her bare skin quickly proved too much for
Sakura.  She began thrashing in Tomoyo&#39;s grasp, bucking
violently.  Just when she thought it could get no better,
Tomoyo&#39;s index finger pressed harder, determined to enter
Sakura&#39;s cherry blossom.
     &quot;Oh!  Ummm . . . TOMOYO-CHAN!&quot;
     Sakura&#39;s world turned pink as her hips arched high off
Tomoyo&#39;s lap and her panties began to soak.  She froze in
mid-air, then fell to earth exhausted.  As Sakura&#39;s vision
recovered, a hazy image loomed above her.  As it focused, she
recognized it to be the face of Tomoyo, her friend, partner, and
now lover.  It was the first time she had seen her face since the
measuring started.  Sakura tried to speak, but words didn&#39;t form.
She just stared with her mouth slightly agape, feeling thin
trails of perspiration run across her forehead.  Tomoyo looked
down at Sakura with a smile on her face and also, as Sakura
looked harder, a thin wetness on her lips.  As Sakura realized
what it must be, Tomoyo slowly licked her lips and brought her
hand into Sakura&#39;s line of sight, showing her what she had done.
Tomoyo then brought the hand down to Sakura&#39;s level where she
stared at it intently.  She watched as a thin droplet slowly ran
down Tomoyo&#39;s finger and fell, striking her lips and beading
between them.  Sakura slowly parted her lips, letting the fluid
reach her tongue.  She swallowed it and sighed.  She then licked
her lips of the remaining residue.  Relishing the subtle taste,
she looked up at Tomoyo.  Sakura blushed mildly, then opened her
mouth, her tongue slightly extended and her eyes slanted
lustfully.  Tomoyo smiled and conceded, lowering her finger into
Sakura&#39;s mouth where Sakura proceeded to suck her own juices from
Tomoyo&#39;s hand.  Her eyes closed as her tongue slowly slid around
Tomoyo&#39;s finger, the flavor completely intoxicating her.  The
feeling of Sakura&#39;s tongue caressing her finger excited Tomoyo
and she brought her head down to Sakura&#39;s level to help her clean
her hand.  She stuck out her own tongue and began licking the
back of her own hand, drinking Sakura&#39;s juices as well.
     After the task was done, Tomoyo pulled her finger from
Sakura&#39;s mouth and watched it shine faintly from Sakura&#39;s saliva.
With her eyes closed, Sakura was surprised when the finger left
her mouth.  She opened her eyes in time to see Tomoyo, much
closer, take the finger and insert it between her own lips.
Sakura watched as Tomoyo slurped all the remaining fluid on her
finger, moaning softly.  After she was done Tomoyo looked down at
Sakura, her hair falling about the two of them.  After a timeless
second, Sakura slowly parted her lips as before.  Tomoyo brought
her hands to the sides of Sakura&#39;s head and descended upon her,
pressing their bodies against each other, giving her a slow,
sensuous kiss.  Sakura managed to regain enough strength to put
her arms around Tomoyo and hold her from below as she pushed her
tongue into Tomoyo&#39;s mouth.  Tomoyo did the same,  both of them
moaning from the feel of the soft, wet muscles intertwining and
dancing in each other&#39;s mouth.  Tomoyo finally, breathlessly,
released Sakura, both panting as a thin trail of saliva remained
to represent when two were one.  Tomoyo&#39;s body finally gave out
and she fell upon Sakura, her head beside her friend&#39;s.  As
Tomoyo faded into unconsciousness,  she heard one sentence.
     &quot;I love you, Tomoyo-chan.&quot;
     Then Sakura succumbed as well and they slept, nestled in
each other&#39;s arms.  And somewhere, off in the distance, were the
silent hum and unblinking eye of Tomoyo&#39;s video camera.
