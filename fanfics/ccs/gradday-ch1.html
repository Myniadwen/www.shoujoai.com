<h1>Graduation Day</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grandmoff.html">GrandMoff</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The black-haired girl was getting bored.  She and Sakura were 
graduating today, but the highlights of the ceremony had come and 
gone.  The awards had been neat; her beloved Sakura had gotten the 
highest student/athlete award.  Tomoyo herself had received the best 
music award.  But once these things were over, it was time to start 
listening to speeches.  To make matters worse, Tomoyo&#146;s camcorder&#146;s 
battery had run down, so she couldn&#146;t tape Sakura anymore today.

And Sakura looked so pretty today, so elegant.  And she smelled 
wonderful, too; she wore a new perfume that reminded Tomoyo of late 
springtime.  Just by being this close, she was unwittingly driving 
Tomoyo to distraction.  Suddenly, Tomoyo formed a brilliant, 
thoroughly evil idea.

&#147;Sakura-chan,&#148; she whispered seductively into her best friend&#146;s ear, 
&#147;You&#146;re so beautiful.  I just want to lead you up to that main table, 
lay you down, rip off your clothes, spread chocolate frosting all over 
you-&#147;

&#147;-What?&#148; Sakura interjected, barely keeping her voice to a loud 
whisper.  A few students seated near her stared for a minute as a 
cherry-red blush blossomed on her face.  She waited until they&#146;d 
turned away.  Tomoyo was grinning.  &#147;Shame on you,&#148; Sakura hissed in 
horror.  &#147;I can&#146;t believe how naughty you are!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s your fault for getting me all hot.  If you didn&#146;t want me to 
have these &#145;naughty thoughts,&#146; you shouldn&#146;t have agreed to exchange 
underwear with me.  All I can think is, &#145;I&#146;m wearing Sakura-chan&#146;s 
cute satin panties!&#146;&#148;

The brown-haired girl groaned.  &#147;I knew that would come back to haunt 
me,&#148; she said with false regret.  &#147;Please, just control yourself.  
This ceremony is almost over.&#148;

Tomoyo stuck out her lower lip.  &#147;I don&#146;t think I can wait much 
longer.  After this, we&#146;ve got that banquet.  Then we&#146;re going over to 
your house to talk with your dad and brother and my mom.  Only when 
that&#146;s finally over will I be able to take my lovely Sakura-chan to 
bed and make her-&#147;

&#147;-Stop it, Tomoyo-chan!&#148; Sakura said in a shocked voice.  &#147;This&#146;ll be 
done soon enough, okay?  Or am I not worth the wait?&#148;

&#147;Well, when you put it that way&#133;&#148; Tomoyo sighed.  But she smiled 
inwardly.  She wasn&#146;t giving up, not by a long shot.

The graduation ceremony ended.  Sakura and Tomoyo got into the limo 
Tomoyo&#146;s mother had provided.  &#147;To the Ruby Restaurant, please,&#148; 
Tomoyo told the chauffeuse.

&#147;See, it&#146;s not so bad, is it?&#148; Sakura asked.  &#147;We won&#146;t have to stay 
at the banquet very l-mmphff!&#148;

Tomoyo had pounced, pulling her lover into a long, burning kiss.  
Sakura returned it with equal enthusiasm, tasting the blue-eyed girl&#146;s 
tongue, enjoying the pressure of her delicious lips.  The pair 
embraced tightly and kept kissing for most of the ride.  With plenty 
of resistance from Tomoyo and herself, Sakura pulled away at last.

&#147;We&#146;re nearly there, I think, and we need to ditch the ceremonial 
gowns,&#148; she explained.

&#147;You&#146;re right.  You take off mine and I&#146;ll take off yours, all right?  
The zippers are so tricky to reach.&#148;

Sakura nodded in agreement.  She took her time removing Tomoyo&#146;s gown 
and then turned her back to let Tomoyo help her with hers.  She felt 
Tomoyo&#146;s small, delicate fingers linger on her back for far longer 
than necessary and she smiled.  But then Tomoyo pushed the loose robe 
off her shoulders, sliding the straps of her dress along with it-

&#147;-Tomoyo-chan!&#148; she said reprovingly.

&#147;It was an accident,&#148; Tomoyo said, not fooling Sakura at all.

&#147;It was not!  Honestly!&#148;

&#147;Gomen ne,&#148; Tomoyo hastily apologized.  &#147;But you have to understand.  
The most beautiful woman in the world wanted me to help undress her; 
it would strain anyone&#146;s self-discipline.&#148;

&#147;How sweet,&#148; Sakura melted.  She gathered Tomoyo into another deep 
kiss.  Then the car stopped.

&#147;Should only be about an hour or so,&#148; Sakura told her friend as they 
entered the building.

They seated themselves across from each other at a long table.  Most 
of their old friends were situated around them.  Naoko and Rika sat on 
either side of Tomoyo; Meilin and Chiharu were to Sakura&#146;s right and 
left.  The food was served almost immediately and it was quite good.  
The conversation was engaging too.

&#147;Where are you going from here?&#148; Chiharu asked Tomoyo.

&#147;Ask Sakura-chan,&#148; Tomoyo replied.

Sakura&#146;s face lit up with a red glow, but she stayed calm.  &#147;How about 
it then?&#148; Chiharu pressed.  &#147;Where are you and Tomoyo-chan going after 
this?&#148;

&#147;Well, w-&#147;  Suddenly, Sakura felt a silk-clad foot gently rubbing her 
lower leg.  Tomoyo was smirking, but trying to suppress it.  Sakura 
swallowed hard and continued.  &#147;We are planning on attending the 
University of Tokyo.  We&#146;ve given it a lot of thought.  I&#146;m sure it 
will be-&#147;

Tomoyo&#146;s foot was on her knee now, sliding slowly higher.  Still, 
Sakura didn&#146;t panic.  Tomoyo would have to run out of space soon.  The 
table was fairly wide; the black-haired demoness couldn&#146;t extend her 
reach much further.  With a shudder of arousal, Sakura took up her 
thread again.  &#147;It will be difficult, of course, but I believe that 
Tomoyo-chan and I can make the grade.&#148;

&#147;If anyone can, it&#146;s you two,&#148; Naoko asserted.

Tomoyo&#146;s foot was slowly traveling higher and higher up Sakura&#146;s 
thigh.  How was that possible?  Only if Tomoyo was-oh no!  She was!  
She was slipping lower and lower in her seat.  Someone was sure to 
notice, Sakura realized.  What could she do?  Then she remembered that 
Naoko had just complimented them.  &#147;Arigatou,&#148; she said a tad 
breathlessly.  &#147;How about you, Naoko-chan?&#148;

Luckily, everyone but Tomoyo and Sakura turned their attention to 
Naoko.  &#147;I&#146;m going to Hokkaido&#133;&#148; she was saying.  Sakura didn&#146;t hear a 
word.  Tomoyo was wiggling her toes against Sakura&#146;s most sensitive 
spot and she was so far down in her chair that her head was barely 
above the table.  Sakura stifled a whimper and stood up, trying to 
save herself from the determined temptress across the table.

&#147;Got to get more sushi,&#148; she stammered to the surprised group seated 
with her.

&#147;So do I,&#148; Tomoyo said, nearly giggling.  She hurried after Sakura.  
As she got to the buffet, the green-eyed girl whirled on her.

&#147;What&#146;s gotten into you?&#148; she demanded.  &#147;Are you trying to make me 
pass out from lack of blood, since it&#146;s all in my face?  Some 
girlfriend you are!&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; Tomoyo said innocently.  &#147;Just stretching my legs was 
all.  You should have ignored me.&#148;

&#147;Ignore that?&#148; Sakura objected.  &#147;The woman I love is rubbing me in a 
crowded restaurant and I&#146;m supposed to ignore it?  Look, just behave 
yourself.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s what you do to me, darling.  But I promise to try my best.&#148;  
She winked and pinched Sakura&#146;s backside.

&#147;Wow, I feel reassured,&#148; the brown-haired girl said in her most 
sarcastic voice.

It was a struggle, but Tomoyo kept her word, mostly.  She brushed up 
against Sakura a couple times, but in general conducted herself very 
well.  Sakura was plenty grateful for this, because Tomoyo had been 
getting her very worked up.  She didn&#146;t want to admit that to Tomoyo, 
of course; the knowledge would only encourage her to keep the 
lascivious teasing going.  As soon as the two ladies got back into the 
limo, Sakura lunged.  She started sucking on Tomoyo&#146;s tongue and 
letting her hands roam all over Tomoyo&#146;s lithe body.  The girls made 
out for a few minutes when suddenly the driver&#146;s voice came over the 
intercom.  &#147;Destination, please?&#148;

Sakura wrenched her mouth away from Tomoyo&#146;s lips.  &#147;Kinomoto 
residence, please,&#148; she managed to say.  Then Tomoyo was kissing her 
again, keeping her extremely busy.  It was all Sakura could do to keep 
herself clothed until the limousine rolled to a stop in front of her 
house.  &#147;Okay, you little bottle of mischief, I need one more hour of 
civilized behavior from you.&#148;

&#147;Aw,&#148; Tomoyo whined, &#147;why did you have to get me all fired up then?  
How is that fair?&#148;

&#147;That wasn&#146;t to &#145;fire you up,&#146; as you put it; it was to tide you over 
until we&#146;re done here.  Now be a good girl.&#148;

&#147;Sure,&#148; Tomoyo chuckled, playing with Sakura&#146;s breasts.

&#147;I mean it!&#148; Sakura chided.

Soon they were all seated around the Kinomoto dinner table, playing a 
challenging but fun game that Sakura&#146;s father called &#147;Trivial 
Pursuit.&#148;  The parents surprisingly had real difficulties with Tomoyo, 
who had a memory like super glue.

&#147;It&#146;s the end of an era,&#148; Touya mourned as he took his move.

&#147;How&#146;s that?&#148; his father asked.

&#147;We&#146;re out of school, oto-san, even the kaiju,&#148; he joked.

Sakura was about to retaliate when she felt her friend&#146;s nimble 
fingers lightly stroking her inner thigh.  She turned almost lavender, 
her retort dying before it reached her lips.  She squirmed, but Tomoyo 
just wouldn&#146;t take the hint.

Touya, meanwhile, was staring at his younger sister.  &#147;You&#146;re going to 
let me get away with that, Sakura-chan?  Are you feeling okay?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, I feel pretty darn good,&#148; Sakura said, sweatdropping.  &#147;I&#146;m 
grown up now; it&#146;ll take more than just calling me a monster to get me 
riled.&#148;

&#147;Glad to hear it, kaiju,&#148; Touya chuckled.

&#147;You are going to study at the university with a specific goal in 
mind, right Sakura-chan?&#148; Sonomi asked.

My goal is to survive your daughter&#146;s attempts to screw me to death, 
Sakura thought without meaning to.  She blushed even harder.  &#147;I want 
to be an architect, Daidouji-san,&#148; she said as evenly as she could.  
She felt Tomoyo&#146;s hand almost reaching the panties she was 
wearing-Tomoyo&#146;s panties.  She couldn&#146;t take much more of this.

&#147;It&#146;s important to have goals,&#148; Sakura&#146;s father stated.  &#147;And today, 
you two achieved one of those goals.  This calls for celebration.  
I&#146;ve got a bottle of champagne-&#147;

&#147;-I&#146;ll get it!&#148; Sakura cried, leaping up from Tomoyo&#146;s incessant 
torture.

&#147;Let me come with you,&#148; Tomoyo said, rising as well.  A feeling of 
dread poured over Sakura, but she had no good reason to decline the 
request.  The two girls headed down to the basement.

As Sakura&#146;s foot hit the floor, before she even had a chance to turn 
around, Tomoyo&#146;s hands were under her dress, yanking her underwear 
down past her knees, dropping them to the carpet.  &#147;Hey!&#148; she yelped.

&#147;I want my panties back.  Now,&#148; Tomoyo growled playfully.  She forced 
her thigh between Sakura&#146;s legs.

&#147;Tomoyo-chan!&#148; the brown-haired girl squeaked.  She couldn&#146;t walk with 
the panties around her ankles, so she stepped out of them quickly.  
She began to dodge, but Tomoyo advanced even more swiftly.  She 
grinned maliciously, got a firm grip on Sakura&#146;s bottom, and lifted 
her onto the green billiard table.  Her hands went back under Sakura&#146;s 
dress, bunching it up around the slim young woman&#146;s waist.

&#147;Stop, Tomoyo-chan,&#148; Sakura begged.  &#147;We might-&#147;

&#147;-I&#146;m through waiting,&#148; Tomoyo declared in a flat voice.  &#147;It&#146;s time 
for Sakura-chan to come.&#148;  She thrust her head between Sakura&#146;s 
shaking knees and immediately began to assault her sopping, naked 
vagina with her mouth.  It was obvious that Sakura&#146;s body was more 
than ready for this.

Sakura&#146;s eyes rolled back.  &#147;Tomoyo!&#148; she gasped.  &#147;We could-ah!  Get 
caught!&#148;

&#147;I know,&#148; Tomoyo mumbled without lifting her head.  &#147;So you&#146;d better 
come fast.&#148;

&#147;Ah!  Oh!  Ah!&#148; Sakura shrieked.  Her toes curled.  Tomoyo had been 
building her anticipation steadily all day and now she was delivering 
in spades.  Her lips and tongue seemed to be everywhere.  The 
sensations were so strong that it was like Tomoyo licking her entire 
body in long, languid strokes.  Sakura&#146;s every molecule sang with 
unbelievable pleasure.  This was their gathering; they should be 
upstairs; Touya was bound to come looking for them an second-but damn, 
Tomoyo was loving her right!  Sakura didn&#146;t want her to stop, not at 
all, no matter what the consequences might be.

&#147;What&#146;s taking those girls so long?&#148; Sakura&#146;s father wondered.

Touya and Sonomi glanced at each other knowingly.  &#147;I&#146;m sure they&#146;ll 
be back in a minute,&#148; Sonomi laughed nervously.  I hope, she added 
silently.  This isn&#146;t the best way for Sakura&#146;s father to find out 
about them.  I can&#146;t believe he doesn&#146;t know already.

The curious man started to rise from the table.  &#147;I&#146;d better-&#147;

&#147;-No, no,&#148; Touya intervened.  &#147;I&#146;ll do it; I&#146;ll go get them.  You just 
relax, oto-san.&#148;

As slowly as he could, Touya strode to the basement door.  He listened 
before he opened it.  He could distinctly hear his little sister&#146;s 
muffled cries of ecstasy.  He stopped and waited embarrassedly, not 
wanting to walk in on Tomoyo and Sakura while they were so&#133;active.

&#147;Good job, Sakura-chan; I think that&#146;s about the fastest you&#146;ve ever 
climaxed.  I knew you could do it!&#148;

&#147;I love you, Tomoyo-chan,&#148; the green-eyed girl sighed.  &#147;Now let&#146;s 
hurry and get back upstairs.&#148;

&#147;Right,&#148; Tomoyo agreed, wiping her mouth with a handkerchief from her 
purse.  &#147;You taste so great.&#148;

&#147;Where are my panties?&#148;

&#147;You mean, my panties?&#148;

&#147;Yes.  Come on, I need them.&#148;

&#147;They somehow got looped around a blade of the ceiling fan,&#148; the 
blue-eyed beauty snickered.

&#147;What?  You did that on purpose&#133;but when did--I mean, how did you?&#148;

&#147;No time to explain.  We&#146;d better get back up there.&#148;

&#147;You are the most evil person I know,&#148; Sakura pouted.

Touya opened the door a crack.  &#147;Are you two done yet?&#148; he called as 
loudly as he dared.  &#147;Dad&#146;s getting suspicious.&#148;

&#147;Just a second!&#148; Tomoyo chirped while Sakura went redder than she had 
in years.  Tomoyo gripped her lover&#146;s arm and hauled her toward the 
staircase.

&#147;Underwear!&#148; Sakura reminded.

&#147;I&#146;m afraid you&#146;ll have to do without,&#148; Tomoyo answered sweetly, never 
pausing.

Sakura was terrified.  She knew that once they returned to the table, 
Tomoyo would be starting again in ten minutes, tops.  Her only hope 
was to end the gathering before Tomoyo renewed her attack.  But how?  
She pondered the possibilities desperately.

She gave her dad the champagne bottle and took her seat next to her 
gorgeous lover.  Given what she just did downstairs, she ought to be 
satisfied for a little while at least, Sakura hoped.  But today she&#146;s 
been a super-mega hornball, so I can&#146;t count on more than a brief 
respite.

Sakura&#146;s father pulled the cork out of the bottle with a loud pop.  He 
started pouring.  Sakura glanced at Touya.  He raised his eyebrows and 
smirked.  Feeling a rising blush, she quickly turned away, only to 
find herself staring directly into Sonomi&#146;s eyes.  Tomoyo&#146;s mother 
grinned at the embarrassed girl.  Sakura would have bet the she could 
fry an egg on her cheeks; they were as hot as a griddle.  Obviously, 
Sonomi knew what was going on between her and Tomoyo.  But how had she 
found out?  Sakura felt some relief though; Sonomi clearly approved of 
the relationship.

&#147;I would like to propose a toast,&#148; Sakura&#146;s father announced as he 
recorked the bottle.  &#147;Happiness and success to Tomoyo and Sakura!&#148;

Sonomi, Sakura, and Touya blushed at his choice of words, but everyone 
raised their glasses and toasted.

&#147;Mm, this is very good.  Arigatou, Kinomoto-san,&#148; Tomoyo said 
politely.

&#147;Hear, hear,&#148; Sonomi said.  &#147;And thank you for having us over.  My 
daughter is blessed to know such wonderful people as you.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t I know it?&#148; Tomoyo said, squeezing Sakura&#146;s leg under the 
table.

&#147;Please don&#146;t mention it,&#148; Sakura&#146;s father replied.  &#147;I&#146;m glad that 
Sakura-chan has such a terrific best friend and I&#146;m honored that you 
accepted the invitation to our house.&#148;

Tomoyo began caressing Sakura&#146;s upper thigh.

Miraculously, the little get-together broke up just a few minutes 
later, while Sakura was still able to disguise her moans.

Sakura ran to her room, with Tomoyo chasing right behind.  As soon as 
Tomoyo got past the door, Sakura shut it behind her and tackled her to 
the mattress.  &#147;I love you Tomoyo-chan, in spite of your being a 
wicked temptress who can&#146;t keep her hands to herself.  But-&#147; here she 
lowered her voice and gazed into Tomoyo&#146;s stunning blue eyes with her 
dazzling green eyes &#147;-you know you&#146;re about to be punished.&#148;

A chill of exhilaration raced up and down, up and down, along Tomoyo&#146;s 
spine.  In three seconds, Sakura had her naked.

I love it when a plan works, Tomoyo reflected blissfully.</pre>
