<h1>Remastered III (part 2 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster3-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>One of Sakura&#146;s happy moments inspired her.

She remembers waking up the morning after she and Tomoyo first made 
love, staring into the camera lens of one of Tomoyo&#146;s cameras (wielded 
by the scantily clad Tomoyo herself). &#147;?&#148;

&#147;Smile. I want to get this all for the camera.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan---&#148; Sakura sweat drops, looking into the lens, &#147;Why are 
you---&#148;

&#147;I wanted to film you while you were sleeping. You looked so beautiful 
lying there so contently.&#148;

Sakura smiles abit, reaching a hand up to touch Tomoyo&#146;s cheek, &#147;You 
made me so happy---I---&#148;

&#147;Hush.&#148; (Tomoyo touches Sakura&#146;s cheek) &#147;I know we promised to wait, 
but I love you--- I wanted to make your birthday special--- and 
maybe---&#148;

&#147;I already decided that we&#146;ll never part, nothing is going to change 
that. Nothing.&#148;

Tomoyo nods her head, slowly pulling the camera to one side only for 
Sakura to stop her, &#147;Wh--?&#148;

&#147;Keep filming please. I&#146;m getting used to the camera filming our 
special moments.&#148;

&#147;Really?&#148; (Sakura nods her head) &#147;Ok---&#148; (a warm smile creeps across 
Tomoyo&#146;s features) &#147;---I&#146;ll get the tripod and you take your undies 
off again!&#148;

&#147;---Tomo-chan---&#148;

The idea of the camera to break the ice made Sakura think---

-----

Nina felt something stirring at her feet, she rolls over discontently 
grumbling. &#147;Go &#145;way, Kwero, &#146;m n&#146;t &#145;ungry rig&#146; nu&#145;---&#148;

Though it was 6AM in the morning (a personal record for Sakura in 
terms of waking up), Nina was still half asleep. However that didn&#146;t 
dim her senses enough that she couldn&#146;t feel someone moving on the bed 
towards her. Silence. The movement seemed heavier than Kerberos, and 
it was moving up the bed.

&#147;&#146;etter nut bwe u&#146; gin&#146; Yuko!&#146; Go way&#146;!&#148;

Still nothing. Couldn&#146;t be Miyuko, she&#146;d be asking silly questions 
right about now--- silence.

&#147;&#146;liza, kut it owt&#145;---&#148;

&#147;Mmmm?&#148;

&#147;Liet e&#146; get hup &#145;irst b&#146;fore we &#145;o &#145;gain---&#148;

&#147;---wh---?&#148;

Nina opens her weary eyes, and stares right into Eliza&#146;s eyes as she 
stares from her side of the bed (in just as weary a state, sporting a 
full head of &#147;morning hair&#148; that needed to be put under control ASAP) 
&#147;I&#146;m right here--- what was that about me?&#148;

&#147;?&#148; Nina sighs, slowly looking up towards the ceiling, and into the 
lens of a camera filming her. Bleary eyed she rolls to her side again 
and begins to nudge Eliza, &#147;---ake&#146; up &#145;liza, de head hirit of Allen 
Fund h&#146;s com&#146; to hock us---&#148;

&#147;Morning!&#148;

&#147;---ah damn---&#148; (Nina rolls over onto her stomach and covers her head 
with her pillow) &#147;Hit&#146;s toot&#146; hoon to gwet ou mai lust goo&#146; herbe--- 
go &#145;way!&#148; (still sleepy so she&#146;s muttering)

&#147;I thought you&#146;d want to record your happy moments, maybe---&#148;

&#147;---Sakura---?&#148; (Eliza) &#147;---uh--- this isn&#146;t a good time----&#148;

&#147;---mmph---&#148;

&#147;Maybe tell someone how you really---&#148; (?) &#147;---feel and tell her how 
much you---&#148;

&#147;MMPPH!!!&#148; (Nina rolls onto her back, her eyes bleary and yet angry 
looking. &#147;---moh&#146; on a mumen---&#148; (Nina rolls onto her side, her hand 
reaching over towards the nightstand, fumbling open a drawer which she 
sticks her hand into, pulling out something as her finger jam down on 
the button hard, her hand waving it menacingly (sorta) before her) 
&#147;---muhve oven, I&#146;m gonnu whill her---&#148;

&#147;The saber blade&#146;s in the recharger, dear, you put it there last 
night.&#148; (Eliza)

&#147;---su&#146; that&#146;s whine it&#146;s buzzin&#146;--- thought it was mae---&#148; (turns off 
device and drops it back into the drawer, pulling a gun from the 
drawer.) &#147;---cwhip--- clwhip---&#148;

&#147;Wh---?&#148;

&#147;Better leave before she regains enough sense to kill you. She wants a 
recharged ammo clip.&#148;

Sakura didn&#146;t need anymore prodding, and was out the door without 
being asked twice.

-----

On the way out Sakura runs right into someone as she&#145;s closing the 
door, &#147;Mistress? I---?&#148; (Light looks into the camera lens as Sakura 
holds it up defensively) &#147;---?---does Mistress Tomoyo know your using 
her camera?&#148;

&#147;I only borrowed it--- she has several of them so I thought to borrow 
one.&#148; (sighs as she looks at Light, lowering the camera abit) &#147;I 
thought I could foster some warm feelings the way Tomoyo did when she 
filmed us in bed--- guess it only works if the one doing the filming 
is the one you love.&#148;

&#147;I guess. Got a minute, Mistress?&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

Light fidgits abit, pulling on her maid&#146;s uniform a little before 
speaking, &#147;I was thinking of getting a gift of affection for Fuu--- 
but what does she like? I mean--- we&#146;ve been her lovers (myself and 
Dark being the &#147;we&#147;) for months now yet--- I don&#146;t feel that I know 
her well enough yet. It&#146;s confusing, I want to make her happy--- but I 
don&#145;t know how to best go about this--- I love her dearly---&#148;

&#147;You both make her happy by loving her so.&#148;

&#147;But I want to get something nice. Like the gifts you and Mistress 
Tomoyo exchange. I want to give Fuu something from my heart to express 
my feelings--- but I don&#146;t know what--- I feel so--- awkward.&#148;

&#147;Maybe Dark knows?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s confused too. She wanted me to ask you---&#148;

Sakura holds up the camera again, filming Light as she talks. &#147;Maybe 
Tomo-chan? She knows far better gifts than I do.&#148;

&#147;Gifts for who?&#148;

Sakura&#146;s eyes widen, her breath catches abit--- &#147;Tomo-chan?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll take that.&#148; (her hands nimbly retrieve the camera) &#147;Got any good 
shots?&#148;

&#147;Well, I--- I mean I---&#148;

&#147;Sakura---&#148; (pokes her lightly on the cheek with two fingers from her 
free hand) &#147;---maybe it would have worked better if you gave Eliza the 
camera---&#148; (rewinds film, watching it through the vid screen 
attachment on the camera) &#147;---oh, they were both sleeping--- I---?&#148; 
(stops, looks up) &#147;You&#146;ve been around. Is this footage of Umi/Gaia in 
bed? Umi looks rather confused that you&#146;re in there.&#148;

Sakura looks rather flustered by her earlier &#147;filming&#147; incident, 
blushing as Tomoyo stops the tape. &#147;I made a mistake--- walked into 
the wrong door!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll say.&#147; (Umi walks past the two, motioning for the kitchen) 
&#147;Anyone else want breakfast since we&#146;re all up early? Mistress&#145; woke 
us up.&#147;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry!!&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be---&#148; (Umi smiles as she walks past) &#147;Gaia wants a camera now 
for Christmas. Think she wants to make our own happy videos---&#148; (smile 
turns abit mischievous) &#147;---oh the possibilities---&#148;

Inside the kitchen Umi sets out bowls and pours cereal (one of the few 
things she can make on her own without supervision) &#147;I heard you&#146;re 
playing match maker, Mistress, but maybe making Nina homo--homa--&#148; 
(&#147;Homicidal?&#148; (Tomoyo)) &#147;---that word--- maybe that isn&#146;t the way to 
go--- and why did you walk in on us in bed?&#148; Umi remarks as she shifts 
through the fridge (&#147;Sorry!&#148; (Sakura apologies again)), pulling a 
bottle out opening it, quickly swigging down a drink of the contents. 
&#147;Soda that has the appearance of ocean water (or at least the water at 
one of the nicer swimming pools). What will people think of next?&#148;

&#147;Soda that looks like water from the tap?&#148; (Sakura)

&#147;I think they did that already---&#148; (Tomoyo) &#147;---it is cute though.&#148; 
(Tomoyo leans over, showing the image to Sakura as they share the 
memory of what Sakura saw a few minutes ago. The image on the camera&#146;s 
vid screen shows Umi/Gaia, cuddled into each other&#146;s arms, lying on a 
soft looking &#147;bed&#148; of vines and soft moss which wrapped around the two 
like a blanket) &#147;I never knew Gaia could make such a cute bed! Is that 
real plants?&#148;

&#147;Yeah. She&#146;s the green thumb of the house---&#148; (smiles) &#147;---though I&#146;m 
always a little dehydrated in the morning. Her bed keeps wanting to 
tap a little of my moisture. I like it when we sleep on my bed every 
other day--- my water bed, heh-heh---&#148; (sighs) &#147;---though sex is a 
little hard on it though. All that swaying and rocking, first time we 
tried making love on it almost made Gaia motion sick! Poor thing---&#148;

&#147;Guess she&#146;s not used to it like you are.&#148;

&#147;Comes from formerly being made of water I suppose---&#148; (looks over at 
Sakura) &#147;---what&#146;s wrong, Mistress? You seem sad---&#148;

&#147;I really botched it this morning--- I&#145;m sorry everyone!&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t take it too hard. Your heart was in the right place.&#148; Tomoyo 
assures her.

&#147;I guess, but I just want everyone to be happy.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure they&#146;ll find their way.&#148; Tomoyo remarks, setting breakfast 
before Sakura, &#147;We just have to believe in them that&#146;s all. Like they 
believe in us.&#148;

&#147;Really?&#148; (Tomoyo nods as she pecks Sakura on the forehead) &#147;Really. 
Eat your breakfast, dear.&#148;

-----

Homeroom went smooth, it was afterwards during Keiko&#146;s first period 
&#147;study hall&#148; which wasn&#146;t going to well. &#147;Why aren&#146;t you teaching 
anything?&#148; (Meilin)

&#147;Don&#146;t want to.&#148;

&#147;Is this a tactic so people---&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t want to.&#148;

&#147;---are you holding back your deepest---&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t want to.&#148;

&#147;---are you feeling OK?&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t want to.&#148;

&#147;One too many &#147;Don&#146;t want to&#148;&#146;s dear.&#148; (Rena)

&#147;No, it&#146;s not. I DON&#146;T WANT TO FEEL OK! There! Happy?&#148; (to accentuate 
her point, Keiko rolls over in her chair to stare listlessly in the 
opposite direction of Meilin.)

&#147;Any progress on the &#147;getting Nina beat up so she and Eliza make 
wedding plans&#148; plot?&#148;

Keiko doesn&#146;t even bother giving the voicer of the question a look. 
&#147;---it&#146;s your stupid plan, you go get the crap kicked out of you by 
Fight to get Nina beat up so she can propose marriage. Dummy.&#148;

&#147;You were excited about it yesterday.&#148;

&#147;I was not. I was not. And, if I didn&#146;t say this enough---&#148; (turns to 
look back at Meilin &amp; Rena) &#147;I. Was. Not. It&#146;s your dumb idea, you 
don&#146;t need me to hold your hand.&#148; (turns around again)

&#147;What about---&#148; (stops, notices that Tomoyo/Sakura were nearly sitting 
on top of each other studying) &#147;---never mind.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll do it then! I got beat up by Fight once and I want a rematch!&#148;

Keiko turns, blinks a few times, then turns back. &#147;Xai&#146;s going to be 
pissed if I let her future bride get the stupid kicked out of her--- 
again. So I guess I&#146;m in.&#148; (stops) &#147;By the way, how is Xai anyway?&#148;

Meilin grows silent, turning back to her studies without giving an 
answer.

Her thoughts wander---

-----

That morning.

The hotel room was very nice.

Having an expense account that was bottomless helped a lot. She never 
worried about money anymore, she had other things to worry about. 
Mostly Xai&#146;s bruised feelings.

The room came with three meals a day (good ones though she ate lunch 
in school which the hotel supplied for her as well), a large bed, nice 
bathroom, a huge closet, and best of all--- a full room setting 
holosystem which allowed her to use the entire room as one huge 
holochamber. Usually reserved for couples or guests with wild sex 
fantasies, it&#146;s sometimes also used by business saavy people, 
Judgements and Guardians while out of their own country of origin to 
keep in touch with loved ones (it&#146;s like never leaving the loved one 
behind--- if you had a personal holochamber room in your house which 
was becoming a fad since the technology became easier to install and 
purchase in the late 90&#146;s).

Xai was gracious, and as good a lover as always, but she was 
distracted when Meilin woke up.

She sat on the edge of the bed, listlessly kicking her strange shaped 
feet, still naked her strong muscular form rippled abit as she sat 
there staring at her four fingered hands, and lamenting the same thing 
she laments on and off again.

Meilin didn&#146;t need to say anything, she&#146;s done a lot of growing up 
since she was younger. She simply curls up next to Xai and lets her 
speak on her own good time. Seconds later---

&#147;I guess it&#146;s an acquired taste---&#148; she whispers quietly. &#147;I heard 
humans sometimes have a passion for--- well--- people like me because 
they have some sort of inner desire for--- uh--- what is word--- 
beastie-ality? Something like that---&#148; (Meilin edges closer, drawing 
Xin&#146;s head onto her shoulder) &#147;---I heard stories about families 
ostracizing their children for marrying--- outside their species--- 
bad stories--- you don&#146;t want me do you? We could always just stay---&#148; 
(Meilin firmly places her fingers on Xai&#146;s lips to shush her) &#147;I&#146;m too 
stubborn to listen to what others want. Remember?&#148;

&#147;I do---&#148; (Xai goes back to leaning on Meilin for support) &#147;---you 
definitely are not the arrogant little girl I received as a pupil 
those years ago. The years have matured you, made you better--- 
stronger--- while it made me weaker--- uncertain--- old---&#148; (before 
Meilin could stop her she continued) &#147;---I&#146;m old, Meilin. I have the 
body of a 20-ish woman but I feel inside my age. You shouldn&#146;t marry 
an old mare like me--- it&#145;s not right---&#148;

&#147;Your only 214.&#148;

At that Xin laughs, rubbing her short snout against Meilin&#146;s shoulder. 
&#147;In Palominian terms it still means I&#146;m 42 human years old---&#148; (closes 
eyes for a second) &#147;---does that make me a dirty old---&#148; (once again 
Meilin gently shushes her with her fingers on Xai&#146;s lips) &#147;---I&#146;m old, 
Meilin, I can&#146;t help being what I am! A dirty spent up old mare 
jumping a girl&#146;s bones that&#146;s barely half her age just so she feels 
young again! I have stamina and energy, but that&#146;s nothing compared to 
a mare 100 years younger than me. I feel so---&#148; (shakes her head to 
avoid Meilin&#146;s fingers, pulling away) &#147;NO! Look at me! I&#146;m scarred 
emotionally from years of duty and--- other things, I&#146;m recovering 
from an addiction to pain killers and it&#146;s only thanks to you I 
crawled out of that pit, and hell I can&#146;t even reproduce anymore 
because I screwed that up when I was your age and a booze swilling 
whore! I&#146;M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU!!&#148; (Meilin only reaches out and 
pulls her back in, knowing Xai&#146;s resistance was about wasted away and 
she would go back to resting her head on Meilin&#146;s shoulder because 
they couldn&#146;t stop being with each other, still that didn&#145;t stop a few 
errant tears from rolling down Xai&#145;s face) &#147;---why didn&#146;t we meet when 
I was younger? It could have been so different---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m here now.&#148;

She always says that. And it always works. Xai smiles abit, and pulls 
Meilin back onto the bed kissing her passionately. Sometimes Xai can 
be the happiest woman on the planet.

Sometimes she can come apart as if she was worthless, if only to 
herself.

But she never let Meilin down once in all the years they&#146;ve been 
together.

And Meilin? She never regretted the day she bent down on one knee, and 
proposed marriage to her mentor. The happiest day of her life. She 
didn&#146;t think much of him anymore after that--- she had Xai, that was 
enough for her.

&#147;Xai&#146;s fine.&#148; Meilin finally whispered, her eyes focused on her work.

Keiko let the topic drop and didn&#146;t mention it again.

------

Math work was making Sakura&#146;s head spin, so Tomoyo was helping her 
crunch the numbers.

As they went through the equations and the statistics, they 
occasionally exchanged touches and brief smiles as they worked. &#147;Got 
it now, Sakura?&#148;

&#147;I think---&#148; (blushes) &#147;---guess I won&#146;t know until the test!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;ll be too late by then if your waiting for a mathematical 
miracle.&#148; Tomoyo chides her, running a finger along the back of 
Sakura&#146;s hand. &#147;How&#146;s the Christmas shopping going with you?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m almost done. Just need a few more things to buy for everyone. How 
is your shopping?&#148;

&#147;Done. I might pick up a few extra odds and ends before Christmas but 
I&#146;m done already.&#148;

Sakura sweatdrops, but Tomoyo picks up on it right away and smiles, 
&#147;It&#146;s alright. I&#146;m just a quicker shopper than you. You&#146;ll find the 
right gifts in time, I know you will.&#148;

&#147;Thanks.&#148; (sighs) &#147;I&#146;m still confused though---&#148;

&#147;About Christmas--- or about Nina?&#148;

&#147;Both. But Nina mostly---&#148; (rests head against Tomoyo&#146;s shoulder) 
&#147;---why are they having problems? I thought they loved each other like 
we love each other?&#148;

&#147;Just because Eliza&#146;s a little shy about marriage doesn&#146;t mean they 
don&#146;t love each other. Maybe Eliza&#146;s not ready for marriage yet. And 
you remember what Keiko said--- she might want Nina and her parents to 
become friends before the wedding so she has her parent&#146;s blessing of 
the event.&#148;

&#147;Maybe--- but I wish they&#146;d find a way---&#148;

&#147;We haven&#146;t found a way yet.&#148;

At that Sakura stops even pretending to work, turning to Tomoyo 
suddenly, &#147;Your not---&#148;

&#147;No. I just mean one day we&#146;d want our special day to come--- not yet, 
but one day.&#148;

At that Sakura smiles again, which only widens as Tomoyo gently cups 
one of her cheeks with her hand, &#147;One of these days, Sakura-chan, one 
of these days---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m glad.&#148;

Tomoyo smiles. &#147;What&#146;s that equation answer again?&#148;

Sakura nearly faints into her book. &#147;---Tomo-chan---&#148;

&#147;Test is tomorrow, Sakura-chan, have to be ready---&#148; (leans over and 
kisses her forehead) &#147;We&#146;ll have all Christmas vacation to plan our 
happily ever after--- and longer still to plan that special day.&#148;

Sakura nods once, and goes back to her studies, smiling a bit even 
when the answers eluded her. At least when it came to her and Tomoyo, 
the answers were clear and nothing eluded her--- if only this mathwork 
was as easy as their love for each other. Sigh.

-----

PE wasn&#146;t going very well either.

&#147;Come on!&#148; Meilin goaded, pounding her chest with an open hand, &#147;Let&#146;s 
go Sensei! I&#146;m ready!&#148;

&#147;----&#148; Keiko just stared, not even certain how this came up, &#147;But it&#146;s 
gymnastics---&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s fight! I need the practice and you need to stop moping about!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not moping!&#148;

&#147;Come on! Let&#146;s go! Come on! I&#146;m ready! I&#146;m ready!&#148;

Rena sighs as she leans against the wall, watching Meilin/Keiko, to 
her side she senses somebody. &#147;Hey, Jack.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s with those two?&#148;

&#147;What? You mean Keiko and &#147;Spongebob&#148; who won&#146;t stop yelling &#147;I&#146;m 
ready! I&#146;m ready!&#148;?&#148;

&#147;---uh--- yeah.&#148;

&#147;Meilin&#146;s got a bug up her panties and she&#146;s trying to goad Keiko into 
a fight.&#148;

&#147;Where&#146;s Sakura &amp; Tomoyo?&#148;

&#147;Oh, them? Well---&#148;

-----

The room didn&#146;t want to stop spinning.

&#147;You OK, Tomoyo?!? You over rotated on the cartwheel! You OK? Tomo---&#148; 
(Tomoyo raises two shaky fingers to Sakura&#146;s lips, smiling as the room 
spun) &#147;Hold me.&#148;

Sakura nods, lying down on the bed to take her dark haired love into 
her arms, holding her tight--- Tomoyo smiles, resting her head against 
Sakura&#146;s shoulders, her thoughts only on one thing.

&#147;So this is what the inside of a washing machine feels like.&#148;

&#147;She didn&#146;t think that.&#148;

-----

Rena huffs her breath.

&#147;She COULD be thinking it! I just know they&#146;re cuddling by now, that&#146;s 
for sure! (That was a kind of a nasty spill she took!) And Sakura? She 
practically threw a hissy fit because of it! Imean, I never seen 
someone explode like that--- well, except for Keiko.&#148;

&#147;Alright already!&#148; Keiko finally snapped, her arms coming up 
defensively as she takes a few steps back from Meilin. &#147;Alright, spunk 
girl, give it to me.&#148;

Without waiting for another word, Meilin lashes out, charging forward 
fists flying, only for her blows to be batted away by Keiko without 
her even putting much effort into it.

&#147;She&#146;s doing it again.&#148; Rena sighs as she (and the rest of the class) 
watches the fight unfold. &#147;She&#146;s doing what?&#148;

&#147;Lashing out too much. Keiko&#146;s going to do the same thing Fight did 
and wear her down.&#148;

&#147;Rope-a-dope?&#148;

&#147;Yeah. Watch---&#148;

Meilin moves forward, lashing out with fists and feet, rotating her 
moves to keep Keiko thinking, but all Keiko does is continue to batter 
away each strike without even noticing. But just as quickly as her 
defenses went up, Keiko lashes out. As Meilin moves in to take a 
strong swing, Keiko falls back, reaching out quickly to grab Meilin&#146;s 
exposed arm as she swings and misses, yanking the girl in and slamming 
her leg into Meilin&#146;s side bringing her down. Her other leg whips 
around quickly, slamming into Meilin&#146;s backside dropping her face 
first into the flooring, stunned and injured.

&#147;Yeah. That was fun.&#148; Keiko sighs, shaking off the dust and walking 
away.

As the others gather around her, she pulls herself to her feet and 
shakes off the other students, &#147;I&#146;m fine! I&#146;m FINE!! Get away from 
me!!&#148; (a thin trickle of blood seeps out of her nose, another from her 
mouth where she bit her own lip in shock) &#147;Damn it---&#148; (with a final 
huff of anger, Meilin storms out of PE wiping the blood from her face, 
eyes blazing.)

&#147;Guess the little girl isn&#146;t as good as she thinks.&#148; Rena remarks, 
motioning for the teacher to get the class back under control. As she 
does, Jack turns towards the exit where Keiko &amp; Meilin walked out, 
&#147;Guess not.&#148;

------

Meilin was still pouting that night, still dressed in her schoolgirl 
uniform as Xai set out their dinner. The food each was eating was real 
(prepared using a replicator), but the food the holo-version of the 
other was eating was fake. Only the food in front of the real 
Meilin/Xai where they were (Nippon or the Shining Star) was real, and 
vice versa (Xai&#146;s food was real but Meilin&#146;s was fake from her 
viewpoint).

Xai however was more concerned about Meilin than the details of 
dinner. She wanted to check Meilin over again, she felt so inadequate 
from the distance they were apart. Meilin, noticing Xai&#146;s worried 
expression, managed a meek smile, reaching over from her place near 
Xai to touch her hand.

The touch felt warm to her as if Meilin was there in that room and not 
a holograph of the real thing which was miles away. But, in a sense at 
least, it was Meilin touching her hand. Since the holo chamber was 
sending realtime info, it meant as she touched Xai&#146;s hand, her 
holographic counterpart reaching out touched the real Meilin&#146;s hand 
through the long distance away. It was as if they were still close 
despite the distance.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry---&#148; she whispers.

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;I wish I could have been there for you.&#148;

&#147;You&#145;ll be here once the paperwork is done. Then we can spend 
Christmas and a lot of time here catching Clow cards together--- 
darling.&#148; (reaches up to touch Xai&#146;s cheek, her fingers rubbing the 
woman&#146;s small snout and strong face) &#147;Did I ever tell you how 
beautiful you are in candle light?&#147;

&#147;---more times than I deserve to hear that--- thank you--- beloved--- 
I---&#148;

Suddenly there was a knock at the door, from Meilin&#146;s side of the 
room.

&#145;I told the front desk not to let anyone up to my room.&#146; Meilin 
thought to herself in a slight annoyance as she stood up, &#147;Be right 
back, darling.&#148; (&#145;Who could it be?&#146; Meilin groused to herself in her 
thoughts as she walked over to the door.)

As Meilin opens the door she finds herself face to face with the 
Judgement liaison of Nippon, the energetic and rather chipper fellow 
bursts into the room, his face just beaming with excitement. &#147;I got a 
bead on that item you requested! It took awhile but I should have one 
for you by tomorrow, here&#146;s the storage broach you wanted---&#148; (hands 
off a crystal broach in the shape of a dragon) &#147;---same storage 
capacity as a standard crystal tesseract, so you can store quite abit 
in here and it&#146;s easy to hide as well. Your first report is expected 
in a week so please make sure to drop off your paperwork as soon as 
you can.&#148; (regards Xai, blushes) &#147;Oh, I&#146;m sorry. I didn&#146;t know you had 
company. I&#146;ll speak---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s alright, you can speak freely. She&#145;s my mentor Xai Shar, the---&#148;

&#147;Sorry--- didn&#145;t mean to interrupt.&#148; (looks at Xai, bowing to her) &#147;I 
didn&#146;t know you had company.&#148; (turns to leave, again pointing at the 
broach) &#147;It&#146;s impervious to a great many things so it won&#145;t break 
easily, but keep a good hand on it nevertheless. Well, I&#146;ll have a 
file on what card captures have been reported by Lt. Kotobuki to date, 
and be sure to look it over before you start assisting with the 
captures. I also heard there&#146;s a card in the industrial park where 
King Penguin Park used to be? I&#146;ll have a file for that area ready for 
you also by tomorrow.&#148; (steps backwards towards the door) &#147;---I&#146;ll be 
on my way.&#148;

As he opens the door one of hotel&#146;s security is already there. &#147;I&#146;m 
sorry, 11th Judgement! He said you were waiting---&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s OK. He was just leaving.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s right. I&#146;ll be going. And don&#146;t worry, I didn&#146;t see a thing.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Your company I mean.&#148;

&#147;Yes---&#148; Meilin smiles, blushing, &#147;---well, it&#146;s because---&#148;

&#147;I know how you feel.&#148; (he whispers to her) &#147;I always wanted to bone a 
pony girl myself.&#148;

Meilin face faults, her teeth clenching together as she nearly shoves 
him out the door. &#147;Never--- say that--- to me--- again---&#147; she hisses, 
eyes narrowing, &#147;Or so help me I&#146;ll KILL you---&#147; (as the security 
guard hustles the shocked man the the elevator, Meilin takes a few 
seconds to calm down, her anger still raging after what he said to 
her) &#147;What did he say?&#148;

She quickly shuts the door, her face glowing abit red as she hastily 
heads back to the table, her voice shaking a little as she speaks, 
&#147;N--n-nothing. Nothing at all. Let&#146;s eat---&#148;

&#147;He said something bad didn&#146;t he?&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be silly.&#148; (smiles as she returns to the table) &#147;He just 
surprised me, that&#146;s all.&#148;

&#147;I&#145;m old but I&#145;m not that old yet, precious--- I know what he said---&#148;

&#147;Eat your dinner, darling, it&#146;s getting cold.&#148;

&#147;I guess I should be tickled pink that I&#146;m a pony girl. At least he 
can&#146;t tell an old---&#148; Meilin slams a hand down on the table shocking 
Xai suddenly, &#147;Stop it! Just--- stop it---&#148; (a few tears flow down her 
cheek) &#147;I don&#146;t care how fucking old you are--- I don&#146;t care if we&#146;re 
different! I just want to love you--- why can&#146;t anyone understand 
that? Why can&#146;t you understand that?! I don&#146;t care if your old, or 
worn out, or another species! I don&#146;t give a damn about any of that! 
I-Love-You. I---&#148; (Xai moves forward, taking the shivering girl into 
her arms, holding her tight as she cries, her body shaking with each 
pained sob) &#147;I&#146;m sorry--- I&#146;m sorry--- I didn&#146;t mean---&#148; Xai closes 
her eyes, her own teeth clenched. &#147;To hell with it.&#148; With great flair 
she pulls Meilin into her arms, holding the young woman in her strong 
grip, &#147;Tonight I&#146;m going to love you like a young philly and I&#146;m not 
going to give a damn anymore how old I am! I&#146;m going to be your wild 
young pony girl and love you forever and nothing&#146;s going to stop me! 
Nothing!&#148;

&#147;Maybe dinner?&#148; Meilin meekly asks, her stomach grumbling suddenly.

Xai turns red. &#147;Oh--- yeah---&#148; (she quickly tosses Meilin into the bed 
and grabs the trays) &#147;Dinner in bed and a movie on pay-per-view!! 
(Sometime tame for the meal and something naughty later!)&#148;

&#147;Now that&#146;s the frisky lover I know and care about---&#148; (suddenly her 
voice grows weak) &#147;---he never did this for me---&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Li. We never had this kind of love---&#148; (cuddles closer to Xai) 
&#147;---who cares! I have you and your all that matters to me! That and 
our love and---&#148; (stomach growls) &#147;---uh---&#148;

&#147;Dinner?&#148;

&#147;Dinner.&#148; (blushes) &#147;Let&#146;s eat.&#148;

------

Sakura sighs contently, her muscles relaxing as Tomoyo rubs into her 
shoulders and back hard, relaxing her muscles and nerves. She was just 
too tense from studying so Tomoyo wanted to do something to help her 
unwind from the stress. Of course she remembers the first time she 
tried this--- she was all sensitive and yelping, and Tomoyo had a hard 
time sitting on Sakura&#146;s bottom section because she kept wiggling 
under Tomoyo&#146;s hands and her massaging. In the end they opted for a 
warm bath instead of a massage to unwind that first time, but later 
she got into it. One massage at a time.

&#147;Are we going to catch Fight tomorrow?&#148;

&#147;Your math test is tomorrow, Sakura-chan, I just want you to be 
relaxed--- your well being means so much to me.&#148;

&#147;Thank you---&#148; (sighs) &#147;---I hope you like what I got you for 
Christmas.&#148;

&#147;I know I will.&#148; (stops her work, flipping Sakura over onto her back) 
&#147;I was hesitant to ask, but did you do any shopping for our guests?&#148;

&#147;Yeah. Eliza helped me with Nina&#146;s gift and vice versa.&#148;

&#147;I had the same help---&#148; (rolls over to lie down next to Sakura) 
&#147;---they seem ready to marry but they haven&#146;t yet--- think we&#146;ll have 
that problem when we---&#148; (stops, realizes her mistake) &#147;---uh, I 
didn&#146;t mean it like---&#148;

&#147;Aren&#146;t you---&#148;

&#147;Oh, Sakura-chan---&#148; (rolls to her side and stares into Sakura&#146;s eyes) 
&#147;---don&#146;t be so pouty! We&#146;ll have our day, one day. One day we&#146;ll 
marry and---&#148; (realization hits) &#147;---that&#146;s it!&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s what Nina&#146;s frustrated about! Eliza must be telling her &#147;one 
day&#148; and she&#146;s frustrated that their day doesn&#146;t seem to be coming 
fast enough!&#148;

&#147;I see.&#148;

The two roll back onto their backs, pondering. Then Tomoyo laughs, 
causing Sakura to sweat drop, &#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re so worried about their love! We should let them find their way 
themselves, remember? They&#146;ll find their happily ever after--- we 
did.&#148;

&#147;I see.&#148;

&#147;Besides which, right now the only love I should be thinking of us 
yours---&#148;

&#147;---Tomo-chan---&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s go get something to eat!&#148;

&#147;---&#148; (sweatdrops) &#147;---Tomo-chan!&#148;

Tomoyo pulls Sakura out of bed without another word, bumping heads 
with her gently to make her smile again, drawing her out. &#147;I&#146;ll make 
your favorite treat if you&#146;re a good girl.&#148;

Sakura nods her head and allows herself to be led out.

In the hallway they run into Umi, in her pajamas, holding a glass of 
water.

&#147;Thirsty?&#148; Tomoyo asks as she and Sakura stop to let Umi pass.

&#147;Had water in the kitchen. It&#146;s for the bed.&#148;

&#147;You mean Gaia?&#148;

&#147;The bed.&#148;

Seconds later---

Gaia - &#147;---?---&#148; (feels something wet splash the bed covering)

Umi - &#147;Don&#146;t you ever water the bed? It&#145;s always so thirsty!&#148;

&#147;Water the---?&#148; (looks down at the moss covering and blinks) &#147;---it&#146;s 
thirsty?&#148;

&#147;----sigh---- it draws enough moisture out of me so it must be 
thirsty.&#148; (draws the sheets down and crawls into bed) &#147;And maybe if 
you&#146;re a good little girl I&#146;ll give you a tall drink of me to sate 
your palette before bed--- want to draw a little moisture yourself?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m thirsty?&#148;

&#147;Just hurry and take off your clothes.&#148;

&#147;Oh. Ok.&#148;

------

The next day---

Keiko, stretching her muscles as she walks pass the school office, 
notices someone exiting. &quot;Rena?&quot; As she turns to face her she is 
surprised that Rena is holding something, grinning from ear to ear. 
&quot;Good day to get a reprimand from the principal for boring your 
students to death? Or do they reward your kind of evil?&quot;

Rena walks past Keiko, waving the paper in her hand. &quot;I enrolled my 
daughter to Sakura&#39;s class!&quot;

&quot;Oh, right, and I&#39;m enrolling Eve in a school for brothel workers. 
Yeah, as if you---&quot;

&quot;&#39;ello precious!&quot;

&quot;Hey, mom.&quot;

Keiko turns around, and face faults. &quot;---what the hell---?&quot;

Behind her Rena was hugging a tall young woman, short hair, and a 
strangely familiar appearance. It&#39;s as if she saw her before--- then 
it hit her!

To Be Continued 

&quot;Your from Bubblegum Crisis, right?&quot;
&quot;?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;Inu Yasha?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;Gundam? She must be from Gundam. Sailor Moon? Slayers? I know! She&#39;s 
from Gatekeepers!&quot;
&quot;---keep thinking, you have a whole intermission between episodes to 
get it right--- idiot.&quot;
&quot;---&quot;
Lina (Saint Tail) - &quot;---she&#39;s dumb---&quot;
&quot;Yeah and today&#39;s her smart day. Don&#39;t stand too close, precious, her 
stupidity might rub off.&quot;
&quot;---shut up, I&#39;ll get it soon enough.&quot;
&quot;Everybody ELSE got it already! Sheesh--- your stupid!&quot;
&quot;Am not!&quot;
&quot;Are so!&quot;
&quot;Am not!&quot;
&quot;Are so!&quot;
&quot;She&#39;s from Saber Marionette isn&#39;t she? One of those sex toys?&quot;
&quot;---your dumb---&quot;
