******************************

&lt;July of 1997 (Sakura&gt;
There was a lasting silence in the small room. The curtains were 
closed and only the soft glow of daylight shining through their veil 
illuminated the table in front of me. But I could see perfectly well. 
I wouldn&#39;t even need to see the eight cards spread in front of me. 
This was a much more complex method of card reading than the simple 
one Kero hat shown me all the years back. Yet, judged by the situation 
at hand, this was rather appropriate.
	I stared intently at the two middle rows and the top card. Once 
again the same. Just like every time I attempted to see what the cards 
could tell me. I had tried this countless times in the past but the 
big picture would just not change, nor would it completely make sense 
to me. There was just one thing that was for sure. The premonition, 
beyond doubt, was about Her.
	I squeezed my eyes shut. I thought I had conquered those 
memories but after telling Tomoyo three months ago, I couldn&#39;t help 
but recall some of the horrible scenes that had driven me straight 
from that future into this one. Kuso, I hated myself for making Tomoyo 
worry so much. The accusations had cut right through my heart. I knew 
on some level they were mostly frustration but...
	*Don&#39;t you trust me?*
	That one had hurt. Of course I did trust her. She was the cause 
of why I had come back here, she was why Time had even let me, she was 
the sole reason that I was able to settle back into a remotely normal 
life - as normal as life can be for one of the most powerful people on 
Earth. I had long since given up on the notion that I was the most 
powerful person. Maybe being the strongest mage was true. However, in 
my old time I had met enough other groups of magic users to which my 
power seemed to be a trifle... And none of them had stood a chance 
against Pandora.
	Amazingly enough, after the talk with Tomoyo the tension within 
us had pretty much been turned upside down and nowadays we were almost 
inseparable. I feared that closeness a little since that had been one 
of the things that had troubled me back then. It still did. I would 
feel embarrassed but my mind was too old to be ashamed of the 
thoughts. And I wouldn&#39;t think twice about letting Tomoyo know just 
how much I loved her if not for the simple fact that we were both only 
fourteen. I had never quite imagined this would become a major problem 
of the transition but it seemed I had miscalculated. Lately my 
feelings for the lavender-haired girl had blossomed more and more into 
something greater and more passionate. My adult mind and teenager body 
were having a hard time coming to terms how to react to this.
	&#39;Kami, I am a little pervert!&#39;
	Okay, maybe it wasn&#39;t this bad but I was wondering what the hell 
was wrong with me. This had begun about a year ago, slowly at first 
but then more steadily. At first I thought it was just my teenage body 
beginning to mature but at times the love, and the desire spreading 
from that love, became so strong I was barely able to keep my hands 
off of Tomoyo when we were snuggling or something. I had to put some 
distances between us, yet I had chosen the wrong method as it seemed. 
The resulting frustration from both sides nearly drove a wedge between 
us. That was dealt with and resolved now, the feelings between us 
though had only been intensified and I was silently already preparing 
a last will, because if I should really lose control and Sonomi-kaasan 
found out...
	I chuckled ruefully. I WAS overreacting, not to mention 
distracting myself from the reading and its expected and depressing 
outcome. Compared to that, my little physical problems were rather 
insignificant. Sighing audibly, I slowly turned around the last card.
	Woody was the association, the first card. Woody stood for many 
things, for which one was nature itself, or Life if you want. In 
short, I assumed, it meant Earth itself would face a crisis soon. At 
least that made the most sense from what I expected to come. So 
basically, it was a call from Earth for help.
	Then came Mirror, Time and Illusion. They were the cause of the 
current situation. From experience I knew that Mirror and Illusion 
often were substitutes for other unknown elements the cards couldn&#39;t 
represent, or at least couldn&#39;t represent with the cards available. 
Together with Time at the center it would normally not make much 
sense. However, I knew that Mirror and Illusion most likely pointed at 
the two other Forbidden Clow Cards, those that were responsible for 
Pandora&#39;s release in my time. I hadn&#39;t known that then but I knew now 
after talking to Time - as little as she did reveal -, Kerberos and 
Yue. And the more I learned about this, the more my belief grew that 
Clow was just as imperfect as any other human being and not nearly as 
foreseeing as Eriol said his prior incarnation had been.
	The Light, the Dark and Erase in the next row, presenting the 
&#39;solution&#39;. Alright, the solution was not so more like a pointer, a 
guide, a way of what had to be done to assure an outcome in the mage&#39;s 
favor. The solution could point at powers, people, a lot of things. It 
could also be a gamble, since the solution could also turn into an aid 
for the problem. The combination was a little weird for my taste. 
While I could see Light and Dark together, I couldn&#39;t really place 
Erase. Erase could be another substitute or it could mean something 
completely different. I had some vague theories but that is all they 
were. Vague.
	Which leaves the last card. The location, the Where.
	Shadow.
	As expected. Once again, the location was clouded into shadows, 
unrevealing darkness. I had desperately hoped that for once I would 
get a clue where to look for the Seal Cards but once again no hint was 
given to me. The thing was I could feel the distant presence of a card 
but by their sheer magnitude I suppose they were probably very far 
away.
	Picking up the cards, I returned them to the book and stretched. 
This was getting me nowhere and tomorrow we would all make a small 
trip. I had agreed to the idea readily, seeing this as a chance to 
make up it up to Tomoyo for our little fight and just relax for 
awhile. Summer break had just started and the weather was ideal. A 
part of me wished that we could go alone but I didn&#39;t really mind the 
rest of the family coming along. This was going to be fun and maybe I 
could forget about the cards, the uncertain future and dark memories 
for awhile.

******************************

(Tomoyo)
Whistling a happy tune, I made my way to the front of the Kinomoto 
residence. It had been a nice day and the evening sun was still warm 
and pleasant. Perfect weather for a vacation. Adjusting the bag over 
my shoulder I made a note to myself not to pack so many things the 
next time. Of course I had reminded myself the last time to do so and 
look where it had gotten me
	Not that the little problem was of any significance to the more 
important things in life at the moment. Sakura and I had finally come 
around and while I was pretty sure that she hadn&#39;t told me everything, 
I was simply too happy right now to care. I had overreacted after all 
and chided myself enough about it already. I knew deep down that 
questioning Sakura&#39;s trust had hurt my girlfriend and I wished 
desperately I could take it back somehow. Being confronted with how 
much Sakura depended on me when she revealed some of her secrets to me 
had made me feel so ashamed of myself. Sakura was quick to scatter 
those worries though. And since we both felt too guilty about the 
whole matter for different reasons we came to the agreement that this 
would simply just not happen again.
	And the make up was definitely exquisite. I never thought you 
could be so close to a person. I had also thought I was already much 
more attached to a person than normal, even back then in Elementary 
School, at an age there that was rather strange. Especially since the 
relationship part hadn&#39;t come for another two years. However, seeing 
us now, aside from school we barely spent a minute alone anymore. The 
strength of our feelings was rather overwhelming even by me. Not that 
Sakura wasn&#39;t worth every last ounce of attention but it was as if our 
guilt over the whole accident had undergone the drastic change from 
&quot;turning fire into water&quot;.
	My thoughts were interrupted as I looked up, coming to a stop a 
few feet from the front door. Touya stood there with a grin. &quot;I 
suppose saying &quot;Welcome&quot; as if you are a guest, just doesn&#39;t do it 
anymore, hmm?&quot; It was remarkable how much the two of them had in 
common. While physically not all that similar, Sakura and her older 
brother had a lot of hidden character traits that often made them more 
alike than they&#39;d ever admit being.
	He moved forward, taking the bag not even waiting or actually 
expecting a request. After all this time I was still a little 
surprised - pleasantly so - as how easy Touya had accepted me. 
Compared to Syaoran that is. Knowing me prior probably had helped 
things a little and even with most of his sight gone - Sakura said it 
was returning very slowly - he had always been rather perceptive. 
Something I admired about him in a way.
	&quot;Arigato,&quot; I said, following him into the house and slipping out 
of my shoes. Okaasan had made it pretty much clear to Sakura that she 
was to treat our home as hers and while it had never been said this 
way from the Kinomotos before, the offer was obvious in small things 
like this or the way the treatment had gradually changed from that of 
a normal guest to that of a permanent houseguest or resident even. 
Sakura&#39;s home had also become my home and it didn&#39;t really matter 
anymore where we were or who would stay with whom. Either way, IF we 
were together, we were at home.
	Touya shrugged, putting the bag down next to the staircase. 
&quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll bring it up later. The monster has been in her room 
for awhile again, maybe you can get her to come down and eat 
something.&quot;
	I wasn&#39;t sure whether to give into the humor or the sigh. On one 
hand it saddened me to hear that Sakura obviously was still troubled 
by her worries. I couldn&#39;t fault her, knowing what I did learn so far. 
Sakura had such a good heart and she wanted to protect everyone, 
especially the people she loved and feeling so helpless had to be 
hard. I never really realized how hard it had to be until I learned 
the truth of the events of her timeline. Still, I wished she wouldn&#39;t 
think that she had to take all the responsibility upon herself, almost 
as if she was desperately trying to do it all alone. That is why I 
insisted so much on the vacation when the idea was brought up one 
evening we had all sat together in this very house. The idea for a 
little boat trip was spontaneous but once everyone had gotten into it, 
the plans were quickly made. Hopefully this could get Sakura&#39;s mind 
set on something different at least for a little while.
	I finally managed a small giggle. I found it funny that Touya 
still called her &quot;monster&quot;, even more so than when my girlfriend was 
younger. I supposed that it had become more of an affective nickname 
than the gentle teasing it had once been.
	Already a few steps up the stairs I stopped and turned slightly 
to look back at Touya. &quot;Doesn&#39;t it bother you at all?&quot; I had meant to 
ask the question for awhile now. Sakura had come clean about her time 
travel by now. While both her brother and father had suspected 
something already, Sakura had felt obligated to talk to them about 
this after realizing how much concern it had caused me and how much it 
had to have an impact on her family. The whole thing was taken 
relatively well, she had let out a few things she told me exclusively, 
but other then that most of what I learned was revealed to the rest of 
the family.
	Touya looked at me thoughtful for a moment. &quot;Not really. It&#39;s a 
little weird sometimes. And I admit I feel helpless knowing all that 
has happened already or will happen or... well, you get the point.&quot; I 
smiled wryly, knowing full well the confusion talking about this 
caused me sometimes. &quot;I am just amazed that YOU are taking all this so 
well. Doesn&#39;t it bother you in the slightest, I mean... She&#39;s not 
exactly the girl you fell in love with anymore. I believe it is much 
harder for you, as her girlfriend, than it is for me, as a brother.&quot;
	I didn&#39;t really need to think about my answer. Staring directly 
into Touya&#39;s eyes - well, as much as you can from a higher vantage 
point -, I said softly but with a firm voice nonetheless, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t 
be that - her girlfriend - if Sakura-chan hadn&#39;t done what she did. 
She is still Sakura, all the little details are still there. You can 
see it too, I know that. When you truly love someone, you love 
everything about that person. The positive as much as the negative. 
Tell me, Touya-oniisan, would you turn down Yukito-san if the same 
would have happened to him.&quot;
	The dark-haired, young man stared back stunned for a moment, 
then his eyes softened and he shook his head slowly. &quot;No. Never.&quot;
	I smiled fondly. &quot;Good. Then we understand each other.&quot; I turned 
back to resume my ascent. &quot;We&#39;ll be down for dinner in a few minutes.&quot; 
I swear I heard him mumbling something along the lines of &quot;if you were 
able to separate long enough to walk down the stairs&quot;, smiled to 
myself and proceeded to Sakura&#39;s room.

******************************

(Sakura)
As I leaned back after putting the cards back into the book, I 
realized how stiff I had become. This happened a lot. Often I tried to 
figure out a reading for hours not even realizing the passage of time. 
It was a good thing I still did physical activities frequently to keep 
my body in shape. It would be a little early to suffer from back 
problems...
	My eyes had drifted close for a moment and now they only 
fluttered open for a short moment before the movements of skilled 
hands rubbing my shoulders made me sigh blissfully - though I hadn&#39;t 
made up my mind if it was involuntary or not yet. I had to be pretty 
absorbed to not even notice Tomoyo coming up or slipping into the 
room. Usually I could tell from far away already when she was present. 
Not to mention that I tried not to show her just how much I took the 
whole thing to heart... and often failing miserable at that task.
	&quot;Do you have to torture yourself. Even a day before vacation?&quot; 
Tomoyo asked softly, her voice barely a whisper and close to my ear. I 
suppressed the shudder wanting to run down my spine at her closeness 
and the feelings her warm breath tickling my skin invoked. I wished 
nothing more than to...
	What was wrong with me?
	Fighting down the primal urges of my - entirely too young - body 
I focused on her question, with some effort. &quot;You know I must. If I 
don&#39;t find a way to prevent the seal from breaking than...&quot; I trailed 
off, not wishing to speak further in fear of calling back the haunting 
images of a future long since past. A future that might become reality 
again if I didn&#39;t...
	&quot;I know you will find a way. You always do. But that you still 
have a few years, right? Don&#39;t push yourself so hard.&quot;
	I let go of another content smile as the hands moved from my 
shoulders to my neck and further down my back with patient precision. 
Tomoyo could really give one hell of a massage. &quot;How can you be so 
calm about this. I told you what happened. I stood no chance against 
that... thing. I...&quot; I turned around albeit my body&#39;s vehement 
protests, fixing a startled Tomoyo with an intense gaze. &quot;She killed 
you, right in front of my eyes. I... I won&#39;t...&quot; I could feel tears 
stinging in my eyes and was a little bit surprised at the emotional 
surge that had triggered such a strong response. I usually was much 
calmer nowadays but Tomoyo managed with her mere presence alone to 
create that overwhelming urge to love, to protect, to cherish and 
always hold onto this incredible gift. I couldn&#39;t maintain my shields 
around her for long. &quot;I will never let this happen again,&quot; I finished, 
trying to make my voice sound firm but it was more a croaked whisper. 
&quot;Never...&quot;
	Before I even knew what was happening we were kissing. And not 
just the chaste kiss of children or young teenagers but laced with a 
mixture of passion and need. My arms went around Tomoyo&#39;s waist on 
instinct drawing her closer, basking in the heat of the contact. Not 
just the physical but also the spiritual one. Our kisses had become 
that much bolder lately and they weren&#39;t always initiated by me. 
Tomoyo proved very quickly that this important aspect of life was as 
much one of the skills she was so good with, just like all the others. 
And so I found myself relenting briefly as the kiss began to involve 
tongues rather quickly, that sweet scent, so distinctive Tomoyo, 
filling my mouth, literally drinking up all the troubles, concerns and 
fears of only a few moments ago.
	Finally Tomoyo drew away but only a few inches. I am sure my 
face was flushed since hers definitely was. A part of me was 
disappointed at the lack of contact and wanted to reengage right away, 
taking this to places I steadfastly refused to even let myself think 
about. The beautiful lavender-haired girl had her fingers tangled in 
some strands of my hair falling in disarray over my face. &quot;I know, 
Sakura-chan. I know you will always be there to protect me. I told you 
that a long time ago and my belief has not changed. You have taken all 
those risks and changed your future already. Your beautiful heart will 
find a 
 when the time is right. Please, don&#39;t burn yourself 
out. That won&#39;t get us anywhere and brings you only more pain. I hate 
to see you suffer.&quot;
	I stared in amazement at this magnificent creature. What in all 
the world had I done to earn such trust, such loyalty, such love from 
this gentle and kind girl. When I was young and unknowing of her 
feelings I had often felt a little embarrassed. But never scared. I 
knew some people who experienced our interaction wondered why I wasn&#39;t 
scared of Tomoyo&#39;s devotion. Yet, I could never be scared of such a 
wondrous thing. Now, I was simply amazed and every time she looked at 
me like this, so completely without doubt, utter faith in her gaze 
that I would never let her come to harm, I knew that I wasn&#39;t worth 
it. But yet, it always created a confidence in me so strong that I 
felt like being able to strike down any foe ever trying to harm this 
otherworldly creature that I could dare call my girlfriend.
	&quot;I don&#39;t deserve you,&quot; I whispered, one hand softly stroking the 
pale skin of her cheek. I had never felt like this before. Not with 
Syaoran, never with him. That realization had come gradually but by 
now I was certain that while a part of me would always love him, my 
statement that the love for him and Tomoyo was an equal one had long 
since expired. The magnitude of love I felt for Tomoyo know had 
definitely exceeded what I ever had felt for the Chinese boy. &quot;But I 
love you more than anyone or anything else in this world,&quot; I said, 
making sure she understood completely what I was implying.
	Tomoyo&#39;s smile was radiant, her blue eyes sparkling as if the 
sun was reflecting on the clear surface of a lake. I leaned forward 
again, touching my lips to hers, leaving my gaze glued on those 
brilliant orbs. Sensual at first I felt that inner fire once again 
igniting with renewed intensity and for several seconds I completely 
lost myself in the feelings, tongues meeting in a slow dance, 
passionate but not forceful. So much unlike Syaoran&#39;s kisses. This 
was... softer, slower and at the same much more intense.
	&quot;Hey, monster! Get down here, dinner is ready!&quot;
	I blinked my eyes, realizing only now that somehow Tomoyo had 
found her way into my lap and my hands were resting on her buttocks, 
Tomoyo&#39;s arms were around my neck, clinging tightly as if afraid to 
fall apart if she should let go. I blinked again, slowly drawing away 
and tentatively altering my grip from my girlfriend&#39;s behind to hold 
her around the waist again. I didn&#39;t want to let go but there was that 
slight spark of embarrassment that I had let myself go so far. But I 
didn&#39;t really feel all that bad about it, after all Tomoyo seemed 
quite content where she was.
	&quot;Wow...&quot; I whispered, my breath a little shallow from the 
exchange. I could feel some sweat on my forehead and was rather aware 
that both of our body temperatures had definitely risen to a 
noticeable degree. &quot;That was...&quot; I wanted to say &quot;too close&quot; but 
honestly, I had to agree with Tomoyo&#39;s definition.
	&quot;Intense. Amazingly intense...&quot; Tomoyo responded, equally 
breathless and I was fascinated at how much that sparkle in her eyes 
had even more increased but now it was more like... I wasn&#39;t sure I 
actually wanted to know the answer to that because I wasn&#39;t sure right 
now if I could control the following consequences.
	&quot;We should... uh, get downstairs... Dinner, you know...?&quot; I 
tried lamely, my mind not yet fully restored from one of the most 
passionate moments between us yet. Tomoyo just nodded, also a little 
out of it.
	It was only with a lot of effort and after another few minutes 
of regaining some composure that we managed to follow my brothers 
request. Touya was giving me the most annoying smirk all evening.

******************************

&lt;About two days later (Tomoyo)&gt;
There was one thing that was for sure about life with Sakura. It never 
was boring. I had known this right away when I met her. I knew that I 
just had to put an effort into at least befriending the genki brunette 
or my life would be so much duller. This experience had only grown 
when Sakura came back for me and devoted her attention almost solely 
upon me. The things we did on a regular basis when going out, other 
couples probably never even encounter half the excitement and the 
wonders Sakura managed to produce.
	I had noticed that Sakura liked to use the cards rather often 
for those special occasion but also other everyday life stuff. For 
example creating a nice atmosphere with Glow or Flower, lightening 
candles with Firery or often just flying around with Fly. Sakura had 
developed a close bond with her cards, that much was for sure. &quot;Don&#39;t 
they mind doing all those things for you?&quot; I asked, turning my head 
towards Sakura. The question was more a rhetorical one with just a 
touch of curiosity I could guess the answer already.
	Sakura laughed lightly and I could feel just the tiny bits of a 
ripple around us that &#39;felt&#39; like... giggling. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about 
that. 
The cards actually want to get out and play whenever I let them. While 
they don&#39;t mind being in the book, they like to do things outside, 
interact with the world, you know.&quot; Sakura gazed at me adoringly and I 
felt my cheeks flush, a reaction the lovely girl had managed to bring 
forth more and more in the last days. The passionate scene from the 
evening two days ago was still present in my mind and this hasn&#39;t been 
the only occasion. &quot;And they like you, too, so they like to do things 
that make you happy.&quot; The blush deepened and I melted into the 
following kiss that was much to brief and chaste for my taste...
	Blinking I tried to clear my foggy mind, snuggling closer to 
Sakura who had one arm around my waist so that we wouldn&#39;t be 
separated, not that any of us minded the contact. The water around us 
was cool but not freezing. I believed this to be an added side effect 
of Watery other than providing an air bubble to breath and right now 
the movement as well. We already had been swimming quite some while 
but right now we were content to enjoy each other&#39;s presence and let 
Watery do the stirring, so to say.
	The ocean down here was a captivating sight. Especially this 
way, without diving gear or other such limitations. Only our bodies 
and normal senses experiencing what no ordinary human would usually be 
able to do. Not for that long and surely enough not as deep as we were 
already. This definitely had been one of Sakura&#39;s best ideas involving 
the cards up to now. We had left the world above the surface already 
far behind, exploring the wondrous depths of the ocean.
	I hadn&#39;t expected something like that - Sakura always managed to 
surprise me with those things - when we set out yesterday morning for 
the beach and then a trip with our family yacht. Okaasan had actually 
been glad to have a use for it after all that time. In all my life we 
had only gotten to make use of it once and I had been almost too 
little to remember it then. Now, the yacht served as the perfect tool 
for some nice, relaxing days. Okaasan had been excited to participate 
in the family vacation and readily provided the boat even though it 
visibly got to her to spend so much time in close company to Sakura&#39;s 
father. They managed to behave most of the trip but a few hours ago 
the tension had escalated and everyone had retreated hastily to other 
parts of the yacht to evade the coming war zone. Yukito and Touya had 
went below deck and Sakura came up that we should probably go even 
deeper with a twinkle in her eyes. I had had barely enough time to 
prepare myself - thankfully we already had been in our bathing suits 
for the purpose of sun bathing - before Sakura grabbed me and jumped 
into the calm ocean, activating Watery in the process.
	The feeling was extraordinary. The ocean was calm on this clear 
summer day and the flow was gentle, encompassing the two of us. 
Somehow Watery had managed to make it so that we could breathe 
underwater but still feel the water and move freely. Therefore we were 
treated by the embrace of the wet element, washing over our skin. It 
didn&#39;t even sting in the eyes!
	Right now we were resting from swimming so much, gently floating 
through the vast ocean, letting Watery push us forward. And once again 
we found ourselves in one of those moments. The place was a little 
odd, I admit, but as usual neither of us cared very much and while we 
weren&#39;t even kissing, just the contact was enough to hold us captured 
in the moment. I could feel Sakura&#39;s hand lightly stroking my bare 
skin and shivered. Not from the cold of the water but from the sudden 
heat coursing through my body, making my skin tingle.
	Oh, I wasn&#39;t stupid. I was pretty much aware of the sexual 
tension. There was just no other way to describe it. Both of us were 
rather mature for our physical age and that was even more true in 
Sakura&#39;s case. It had taken me some time to figure out that the whole 
Pandora issue hadn&#39;t been all that had my girlfriend bothered lately. 
I hadn&#39;t been totally sure at first but the level of passion in our 
kisses, the lingering touches, the closeness. The encounter the 
evening before our departure wasn&#39;t the only one and they had become 
even more heated. No, by now I was pretty sure that Sakura had 
definitely trouble suppressing urges she surely felt entirely to 
improper for our physical age.
	How did I feel about this? I honestly wasn&#39;t sure. I would lie 
if I said that the rising passion between us didn&#39;t scare me a little. 
Just a little. I hadn&#39;t thought in this direction at all until a few 
months ago but now I found myself wishing at times that Sakura would 
just go ahead and... See, that&#39;s what I meant. Where I could 
understand and tolerate that Sakura&#39;s older mind might harbor such 
thoughts, I know that for me they were rather... early. Not 
impossible, but early in their appearance. And entirely too strong to 
be natural.
	At the same time the feelings were exhilarating and I felt 
myself craving the attention, the sensations of drowning in Sakura&#39;s 
love and passion, wishing nothing more than to just let go and feel. 
This was frightening in itself but more like a thrill, a good, 
exciting thrill I had entirely no idea how to deal with. I just knew 
if Sakura as much as asked I would jump at the chance and that scared 
me again, just a little.
	Out of the corner of my eye I spotted something and was 
partially grateful for the interruption of the moment. Because as much 
as a big part of me wouldn&#39;t object I think the setting would be more 
than a little awkward. Not too mention, we&#39;d probably traumatize poor 
Watery!
	&quot;Hey, there&#39;s a cave down there!&quot;
	Sakura blinked, a look of disappoint crossing her features that 
almost made me giggle. I suppressed that reaction though and pointed 
down. We were rather close to the bottom I think. The water was 
getting murkier here. Less light was reaching us from the surface and 
it was a little hard to make out the cave&#39;s entrance. Sakura and I 
looked at each other, confirming our mutual curiosity and made our way 
into the cave.

******************************

(Sakura)
Emerging from the water we were both surprised and amazed to find a 
cave that huge. Sure, there probably were enough on the ocean floor 
but when did you ever get the chance to see them. Not that any of us 
was paying much attention to our surroundings. Watery went back into 
card form and then to subspace for the moment with nothing more than a 
thought. My eyes were pretty much glued to Tomoyo and there was a 
conflict inside of me whether to praise or curse myself for my 
impromptu idea. Kuso, Tomoyo was sexy in that dark blue bikini, 
drenched by the ocean water and therefore highlighting the young 
girl&#39;s curves pretty well.
	This was ridiculous. Something was definitely going on here. I 
mean something other than my dirty adult mind and developing teenage 
body. As much as I did love Tomoyo this was getting out of hand and I 
was pretty sure that my control was only a few percent from 
evaporating into thin air. I mean, I had actually kicked Touya for 
flirting with Tomoyo. He did that sometimes and I know very well that 
it was never more than teasing. And still I had actually hit him, he 
had been throwing wary glances my way the whole trip. And the poor boy 
from when we arrived at the beach who dared to... wanted to ask Tomoyo 
out or something. I swear he must have run straight to his mommy after 
the menacing look I had given him - thankfully that had been all. My 
emotions couldn&#39;t suddenly be so out of control. Not naturally...
	&quot;Sakura?&quot;
	&#39;Gah!&#39;
	Tomoyo was standing right in front of me, blue eyes focused on 
me in a wordless, yet demanding expression. I was being drawn into the 
liquid pools, drowned in a sea of happiness and love. I might have 
jumped at the touch, her hand on my cheek, caressing slightly in a 
circular pattern. &quot;What are you afraid of?&quot;
	Crap, she always knew me so well, that hadn&#39;t changed in the 
most aspects of my life even after traveling back in time. With the 
exception of the Pandora happenings and my growing desires she had 
always managed to read me like a book. It seemed the latter was about 
to experience the same fate.
	&quot;Tomo-chan... I...&quot; I breathed, my voice taking on a husky tone, 
feeling her other coming around me, one hand settling on my back. A 
surge of immediate desire rushed through me and my mouth couldn&#39;t 
decide whether to be dry or the complete opposite. I couldn&#39;t finish 
the sentence but looking into her eyes, I knew it wasn&#39;t necessary.
	&quot;You don&#39;t have to be afraid for my sake, Sakura-chan.&quot; I gasped 
when she dipped her head slightly to the side and moved forward to run 
her lips over the skin on my neck. My arms tightened around her, 
almost crushing her lithe form against mine even if that small voice 
that was calling me names was still there. It was fading fast.
	&quot;I... I don&#39;t want to hurt you... This is not how...&quot;
	Tomoyo looked up again and before I could even guess her 
intentions her lips were upon mine. The kiss was sending hot waves of 
tiny flames through my whole body. Her lips were crushed against mine 
and I leaned into the passionate, desperate contact without even 
thinking. The last bit of rational thought was more or less leaving me 
right now.
	Coming up for air after almost a full minute, I realized that 
our hands had become much bolder. Tomoyo&#39;s hands were just resting 
under the hem of my bikini top and mine were already all the way 
there. The desire created between us had reached the force of a 
tornado. I could see the desperation and need reflected in Tomoyo&#39;s 
eyes.
	&quot;Do you really want to fight this?&quot; Tomoyo asked in her usual 
soft, lightly musical voice but still somehow managing to let it sound 
seductive. &quot;We can&#39;t fight this any longer, you know that.&quot;
	Can&#39;t fight...? A jolting sensation of recognition passed 
through me and for just a single moment I managed to tear myself away 
from the powerful thrall both of us were under. No, not so much a 
thrall as the rise of emotions to its maximum. Right here, right now, 
around us...
	Love was here.
	Love, one of the Seal Cards. Time had told me that the reason I 
felt its presence nearing was because the original seal was more or 
less encompassing the whole planet, both elemental powers overlapping 
each other. It had been a steady stream, unyielding and without a 
flaw. Until Clow tempered with those ancient archtypes and bound 
powers where he should have not. After realizing his mistake and that 
he couldn&#39;t control the elemental powers, he had placed the cards 
inside the original seal, reestablishing the power but not the flow. 
The flow had been destroyed, its flawlessness lost. To make the flaw 
as tiny as possible the cards were moving around in the seal in a more 
or less stable orbit. It was no surprise to realize that this had 
given Pandora her opportunity. Clow&#39;s actions to fix his mistake had 
not been enough after all.
	The realization came at a rather bad moment though and most of 
my thoughts on the matter were just like a background image. I was 
aware of it, I was aware of the enormous presence so similar to Time 
back then, yet I couldn&#39;t do anything about it. I didn&#39;t have the 
willpower anymore to call upon some counter spell. I simply didn&#39;t 
want to stop!
	And with a groan of resignation I brought my hands up around 
Tomoyo&#39;s neck, drawing her in. My breath was creating tiny goose bumps 
against her skin, my voice long since having lost the battle to hold 
pack the passion and longing. &quot;I love you so much, Tomo-chan. Even if 
this is not entirely our doing, I want to make you happy. Do you trust 
me enough with this?&quot; I said the last bit with the utmost seriousness 
I could still muster in this situation, yet I was unsure if I could 
take a negative answer anymore.
	&quot;I told you already,&quot; Tomoyo whispered back, her voice mirroring 
my own open desire. &quot;I will always be safe with Sakura-chan. I have 
faith that Sakura-chan will always save me and keep me safe.&quot; 
Proceeding to kiss me again, I simply let go, my body almost sighing 
in relief, welcoming whatever shall come.

******************************

(Tomoyo)
Slowly, with the speed of a turtle climbing a hill my senses returned 
to awareness, my spirit floating back down from that place somewhere 
far above the heavens where it had climbed to... some time... ago. I 
really had NO idea how much time had passed, how long we had been in 
the cave or lying on the cold ground warmed by a small friction of 
magic - but I really didn&#39;t care where it came from right now.
	The tremors had finally subsided and my body lay in total peace, 
every muscle relaxed and surely not able to obey any command in the 
near future. And I felt GOOD. Kami, did I feel good. I had really been 
a little... unsure when I gave in to my desires. Yet, seeing Sakura 
suffer even more, trying to hold herself back, inhabitations had been 
thrown out of the window. Very, very far away. And it wasn&#39;t like I 
had not wanted. We loved each other after all, so it couldn&#39;t be a bad 
thing, just... a little early maybe. It wasn&#39;t like we were still ten 
or something. That would have been rather illogical.
	Feeling Sakura move slightly from her position spooned up behind 
me, I shifted slightly and craned my neck to look behind me. Her face 
was producing a stronger result than the Glow card could... even 
though I was sure the expression was mirrored on my own. I smiled 
widely, feeling giddy and in a state of utter bliss. I&#39;ve never felt 
so much in the right place like now. I was sure that was what I was 
meant to be, where I belonged to be. Right here, in Sakura&#39;s arms, 
enveloped in a warm blanket of love. Body, mind and soul.
	I could see the hint of regret and shame in Sakura&#39;s eyes though 
and was quick to dispel these feelings. With some effort I managed to 
command my body to turn around in the tight embrace. Brushing some of 
the brown hair that had fallen into Sakura&#39;s face out of the way, I 
leaned in to place a soft, lingering kiss on her lips, gazing 
adoringly into green eyes. Sakura smiled faintly. &quot;You keep giving the 
most special gifts in the most special ways. You are such an amazing 
person.&quot;
	Sakura&#39;s smiled turned into a more genuine one. &quot;That wasn&#39;t all 
my doing. Don&#39;t you feel different somehow?&quot;
	I was puzzled at her question. &quot;What do you mean? Of course I 
feel different!&quot; I said lightly teasing.
	Sakura laughed heartedly and the sound was such a lovely thing 
to my ears. &quot;No, no, I mean. About the desire between us. Just until a 
few minutes ago...&quot; She let the sentence linger and I suddenly 
realized what she meant. The whirlwind of feelings had ceased to be 
more gradual, more normal. I had first though this was only and effect 
of the afterglow but there was a little more to it. I didn&#39;t know how 
I could tell the difference, I just did. So when Sakura said this 
wasn&#39;t completely her doing then did that mean...
	I blinked almost audibly and was already in the process of 
sitting up despite the protests of my body before Sakura pulled me 
down again gently but persistent. &quot;Yes, I am sure its one of the Seal 
Cards. I told you about them, right?&quot; I nodded, wondering why we were 
still lying here. Not that I WANTED to move, mind you. &quot;It must be 
Love. But its moving very slowly. We can easily catch up, don&#39;t rush 
now. I, personally, feel like being defiant and not rush after it the 
way it played with us.&quot; Sakura chuckled and run one hand through my 
open hair, drawing out a sigh from me in the process. I had went to 
tie it into a ponytail in the last months but was seriously 
considering to leave it open again in order to experience the 
wonderful sensations my girlfriend&#39;s fingers in my hair produced more 
often. Hmm, girlfriend didn&#39;t seem right anymore. Lover? Mate? It had 
felt a lot like mating on a level and I couldn&#39;t quite believe that 
this all had been the card&#39;s doing.
	&quot;You mean Love made us do all this?&quot; I asked curiously, showing 
my disbelief at the possibility.
	Sakura shook her head slightly, drawing me closer until my head 
rested contently under her chin, almost nestled comfortingly in her 
small chest. I let go of another sigh and could practically feel 
Sakura&#39;s smile in response. &quot;No, the way I understand it is that Love 
cannot produce false feelings. It can only take what is there and 
amplify them. The stronger the feelings the more they are amplified. 
And Love doesn&#39;t do something on its own since the card is embedded in 
the seal. It is a natural side effect. Clow played with something you 
can&#39;t just simply control. The magic he bound into a card was so 
strong that, even ineffective, it puts out incredible power.&quot;
	I listened carefully and would have nodded, had I not been so 
comfortable right now. Instead I said in a lightly teasing voice, &quot;So 
you DID want me THIS way...&quot; I grinned to myself, feeling Sakura shift 
a little... not uncomfortably but surely enough embarrassed. Even if 
her mind was older she was still such an innocent creature at times. 
&quot;It&#39;s okay. You didn&#39;t hurt me and it was the most wonderful gift 
other than your heart that you could ever have given me.&quot;
	Sakura&#39;s arms tightened around me even more. &quot;I love you. I 
really do. More than anything. That wasn&#39;t just because of Love. I 
promise you, I will always love you, forever.&quot;
	I lifted my head slightly, meeting her downward gaze of 
unrestrained, unconditional love with one of my own. &quot;I love you, too. 
More than I could ever put into words.&quot;

******************************

(Sakura)
You&#39;d expect after the whole mess I&#39;d feel guilty. You&#39;d expect I 
would want to harm myself for ever letting my urges get the better of 
me. You know what? I really didn&#39;t care anymore. The experience was 
just so... glorious. And Tomoyo didn&#39;t regret it either. You could see 
it in her body language or every other part of her. She could probably 
be lightening a Christmas tree right now and I surely wasn&#39;t very far 
behind.
	I wasn&#39;t sure whether or not to give Love a piece of my mind 
when we caught up with it though. On the one hand I knew that 
logically seen the card had pretty much no control over its effect. 
Yet, the timing was rather... inappropriate. I still couldn&#39;t believe 
we did THAT down THERE. I mean, sure, I love to treat Tomoyo to 
special things in special places. The cards really like to be useful 
and they really like to make Tomoyo happy too, both of us actually. 
However, this was rather shooting over the top. As I said, now I 
didn&#39;t regret it anymore. It was done with and I was not about to 
destroy this eternal memory of a first time with thoughts of 
self-blame and guilt when my... lover looks like I couldn&#39;t have 
possibly made her happier today.
	Anyway, after resting a few minutes longer, we finally returned 
to the surface. The recovery was only one reason why I wanted to stay 
down there for awhile. No, and the other was NOT to enjoy the feel of 
Tomoyo&#39;s naked form against mine... Kami, I must be blushing madly at 
this thought, I could tell from Tomoyo&#39;s almost smug look - Tomoyo and 
smug! No, that had not been the reason... although it was an added 
bonus. Staying still for a short while would allow Love to pass on a 
little further and therefore lessening the chance of a fallback into 
emotional overload.
	I was very glad I decided on that because I REALLY didn&#39;t want 
to know what happened up here on - and mostly likely in - the yacht a 
few minutes ago while we had our own encounter below the surface. We 
might have just stood there for another minute or so before either of 
us could override the shock to our system at the scene playing in 
front of us. I glanced at Tomoyo with a totally bewildered look and 
saw my girlfriend - I would stick with that for now, the other term 
sounded TOO mature for our physical age - equally flabbergasted. 
&quot;Didn&#39;t you say Love only amplifies what is already there?&quot; she asked.
	I turned pack to the couple at the helm of the yacht, engaged in 
a - pretty intense - lip lock, blissfully unaware of having an 
audience... and probably just as unaware of what they were doing in 
the first place. I shrugged at Tomoyo&#39;s question, rather perplexed 
myself. &quot;I honestly have no idea. It&#39;s not like even Clow himself 
understood what exactly he created there.&quot; Grinning slightly I put my 
hands on my hips and cleared my throat loud enough for the two adults 
to hear.
	There was a very short silence and it seemed as if the world 
itself just stopped breathing for a timeliness moment, awaiting the 
inevitable apocalypse. Then, as if someone dropped a sledgehammer 
between them the two parental figures of our group literally jumped 
several feet apart. Otousan looked rather baffled... well, stupefied 
actually and I could see from the look on Sonomi-kaasan&#39;s face that 
was just about turning from speechless consternation into smoldering 
rage that he would probably not survive the following moments if I 
didn&#39;t intervene.
	&quot;Save it!&quot; I shouted, drawing their attention immediately and 
succeeding in flustering both of them speech- and motionless again. 
Right now I regretted not explaining to them about the Seal Cards as I 
had done for Tomoyo but I really didn&#39;t want to waste anymore time. I 
could sense Love was actually picking up speed... which was strange 
since the paths of the cards were supposed to be stable. &quot;We don&#39;t 
have time for this now. There is a card here I need to catch and its 
moving away right now. So if any of you would be kind enough to get us 
moving.&quot; Granted, I would normally never take such a... commanding 
tone with my father or Tomoyo&#39;s mother. But I knew where this was 
leading when I didn&#39;t intervene and I really had no time for this. I 
could feel in every fiber of my being that this was my chance, my only 
chance to change something about the future I had experienced.
	Just that moment Kero-chan choose to make his appearance, coming 
from below deck and looking rather agitated. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; He 
looked around at the scene, arching a tiny eyebrow at the still rather 
shell-shocked-looking adults and then turned to me. &quot;Sakura? I felt 
the presence of a card. Is that...?&quot;
	I nodded at his unfinished question, already trying to track 
Love. That was funny, I cold feel something else too. Was that the 
other one? If yes, that would be more coincidence when I believed in. 
Isolating Love for now I felt it rapidly moving westwards.
	&quot;Quick, Otousan, turn the boat around, its picking up speed for 
some reason!&quot; I yelled running to the back of the yacht, staring out 
over the ocean intently. I could see something moving in the distance. 
It was to tiny to really make out and for someone without magic 
probably impossible to see at all.
	Otousan meanwhile had snapped out of his shocked state long 
enough to take over the controls and pull the boat around, pushing the 
engine to top speed. &quot;Tomoyo, get Yukito, I&#39;d rather like everyone 
together and who knows if I might need Yue. Love isn&#39;t actually 
dangerous - I think - but I&#39;d rather be safe.&quot; Tomoyo nodded and took 
off. I was pretty sure Yue must have sensed what was going on too and 
was probably already on his way. Hopefully he was because I could more 
or less guess what Love did to him and Touya, considering what it did 
to the rest of us. I really hoped Tomoyo wouldn&#39;t catch them in an 
embarrassing situation.
	&quot;I better take care of this before we all go crazy trying to go 
near that thing,&quot; I said more to myself, only realizing Kero was next 
to me at his squeak when he obviously figured out what exactly I was 
implying. Well, that couldn&#39;t be helped now.
	Taking the key from its resting place I invoked its ancient 
powers and drew Time from subspace. Better to fight Fire with Fire, or 
something like that. &quot;Time!&quot; I called out. &quot;Encase us in a bubble of 
your power!&quot; There was a bright flash of crimson-purple energy and the 
sensitive eye could see the dim, almost completely transparent field 
of temporal energy enveloping the yacht. I heard Otousan gasp and 
realized suddenly that he actually could see all this. Of course he 
could, I told myself, since he has part of Clow&#39;s magic now.
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry, just stay on course.&quot; I reached out once again, 
confirming my earlier observation. &quot;See the small object in the 
distance?&quot; Otousan nodded. &quot;Follow it!&quot;
	If I could have it any other way I really wouldn&#39;t want to 
endanger everyone. But seeing as if I might never be able to come so 
close again, I had hardly a choice left. Besides, the Seal Cards were 
not really... active. Therefore I &#39;hoped&#39; it wouldn&#39;t be all that 
dangerous.

******************************

(Tomoyo)
I found them alright. And I found them just as expected in their cabin 
doing... err, the same that we did... Not that I would tell them that. 
Of course I had had the decency to knock or wanted to... until the 
cabin door was flung open and I was almost flattened by an agitated 
Yue. Thinking back on it I should really not be surprised but the 
sudden change from the powerful yet sweet experience below the surface 
and the serious situation above was rather sudden and I was a little 
nervous, I admit. I knew this was important for Sakura - heck, it was 
important for all of us in the long run. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen 
Sakura so... confident before. She usually was not the type to give 
commands like that. That was a fact that was easily reflected onto her 
cards who she treated more as friends than as tools.
	I hadn&#39;t even realized I complied with her order without a 
question before I was halfway below the deck. That was an amazing 
discovery in itself because I found out just then that there was 
something else to Sakura I was sure neither of us had seen so far. The 
attributes of a natural leader. Not some great military genius or 
whatever you want to call the equivalent for a mage. No, years of 
training had given her an air of confidence that often leaked through 
in many aspects of every day life but really developed in a serious 
situation like this one. Making new discoveries about Sakura has 
always been one of my favorite things, especially since I knew so much 
about her already, seeing new things was rare and often served to add 
another special flair to her magnificent personality.
	As I said, I literally bumped into Yue, Touya following looking 
a little as if he just woke up - which might be true. I shot him a 
knowing smirk - to which the older Kinomoto sibling just shrugged and 
grumbled something - before I turned back to Yue. &quot;You better go up. 
Sakura wanted you there just in case. I get it, you are quite aware 
what just passed us?&quot; The faint blush tingling on his cheeks was 
answer enough for me.
	Yue nodded and was already up the stairs before I could make any 
more comments. I glanced back at Tomoyo and raised an eyebrow at his 
questioning stare. &#39;Oops, he isn&#39;t suspecting anything, is he?&#39; The 
young man didn&#39;t elaborate on the look, just grinned and then shrugged 
his shoulders. &quot;Let&#39;s go up as well. I must admit I am curious. I have 
heard about all this from Sakura and you but I&#39;ve never really had the 
opportunity to see it.&quot;
	Emerging outside a short while later I spotted Sakura standing 
in the middle of the spacious deck, her star wand transformed into a 
size I had never seen before. It was reaching a bit over her head and 
was planted firmly into the ground below. Sakura had her eyes closed, 
seemingly in deep concentration. Kerberos - transformed into his real 
form - and Yue stood a couple of feet behind her and seemed a bit 
unsure about their actual purpose.
	&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Touya asked next to me and pointed ahead of the 
yacht speeding westwards towards the small group of little isles in 
the distance. Funny, I hadn&#39;t noticed them before. There were several 
things I took note of that I know I definitely shouldn&#39;t. First of all 
their was a very faint glimmer around the ship. Like a force field of 
some kind. I had felt the emotional increase fade when I went under 
deck and was pretty sure now that whatever Sakura did was responsible 
for it. But I didn&#39;t think I should be able to see the magic at all.
	Yet I did and I also saw the sparkling sphere in the distance, 
coming closer very quickly. The orange-golden orb seemed to radiate 
purest light to my eyes.
	&quot;Um... That&#39;s Love, I think. I hope the shield is going to hold 
its effects off.&quot; I said, not sure why I revealed my knowledge of 
actually seeing all this. I guess I was subtly seeking confirmation 
that I wasn&#39;t going crazy. Sakura had told me that Touya&#39;s second 
sight was gradually returning so he should be able to pick up those 
things.
	&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s heading straight for that isle. I have the feeling 
that is no... wait a second... You can &#39;see&#39; all this?&quot;
	I shrugged helplessly.
	There was no time for further research on the subject though. 
Sakura&#39;s father had finally managed to catch up with what was 
apparently the card. Suddenly the boat jerked, the engine almost 
coming to a complete spot. I flashed Touya a grateful smile for the 
steadying hand but my attention was quickly drawn back to the glowing 
sphere. Love was hanging in the air looking for all it was worth like 
a tiny star in the middle of the day. I was a little surprised at the 
sudden stop in movement but either the card realized that she couldn&#39;t 
escape - not that the term was accurate in the first place - or she 
sort of knew what was going to happen. Kero-chan told Sakura once and 
she told me in return that all the Clow Cards were automatically drawn 
to the new Master or Mistress. There was a connection between the one 
that was chosen to become their wielder and the cards themselves. I 
had no idea if this was the case with Love but I believed it to be 
very likely.
	I could see the sprite-form of the card - another thing I wasn&#39;t 
sure whether I was supposed to do this or no - and Love looked a 
little confused and uncertain. There was something else there though. 
I didn&#39;t know how I could tell. It wasn&#39;t my observations skills that 
much I was sure of. However, somehow I just KNEW that Love was 
tremendously lonely.
	Glancing at Sakura I waited to see what she would do or if she 
detected the same thing I just did. The Card Mistress had applied a 
lot of unorthodox methods capturing some of the Clow Cards, often 
rather trying to make the cards trust her and let themselves be 
captured rather than to engage into a heated battle. Therefore I 
wasn&#39;t really surprised seeing Sakura&#39;s tense and concentrated 
demeanor suddenly change. For a moment confusion crossed her features 
before she relaxed, her eyes softening and her grip around the staff 
not so firm anymore.
	Kerberos and Yue were about to move forward when without even a 
command Fly&#39;s wings materialized on Sakura&#39;s back. My girlfriend 
looked back with a reassuring smile that halted the two guardians even 
though one could tell they weren&#39;t really fond off the idea.
	The winged girl was about to ascend, then stopped and turned a 
look in my direction. Her eyes finding mine. Quite frankly I had no 
idea what exactly happened but when Sakura held out a hand towards me 
I stepped forward and took it in my own without a word. There was not 
even the thought of hesitation or surprise when I felt something wash 
over and through my body. Identical wings to the ones Sakura was 
sporting burst into existence but my movements were almost 
trance-like. Only one thing was for sure that I trusted Sakura, 
complete and unconditional trust. The level of communication at this 
moment was higher than anything before and somehow we just knew what 
we had to do.
	To the casual observers though - even the magical-apt ones - the 
moment we were on a level with the spectral figure of Love, we 
literally vanished from sight.

Author&#146;s Notes

Yes, I know I am evil.
I said it would be two parts and I actually planned this out a little 
differently. The second part was supposed to take place some time 
later. Love was supposed to be captured already&#133; I just realized that 
for what I wanted to do I had to do it in a shorter period of time and 
the particular scene was just such a nice point to end the first part. 
Don&#146;t worry though. I suppose I&#146;ll be out with the next part very 
soon. Maybe even before Christmas (don&#146;t hold me to that).
I hope I managed to describe the emotions in here in the way I wanted 
them to be represented. This installment started a little slow on the 
writing side but began to pick up pace and intensity fast.
I admit the moment I chose to reveal about what the Seal Cards are was 
rather&#133; odd. Forgive me please, Maia decided to let this story run 
wild halfway through, I actually planned on&#133; say, two more scenes from 
the start of the trip&#133; I really think it&#146;s awkward and maybe I 
actually add those later on. Please tell me if it seems too out of 
place and I change that.
Anyway, things are slowly picking up on the suspense end. The last 
part will probably actually have some action and wrap things up for 
that little pre-series.
I am not sure if I&#146;ll write the actual lemon scene or not. I planned 
to but am not so certain right now.

I hope you enjoyed yourselves again. If you did, then leave me a note 
(mail, review whatever).

Ja ne, yours
