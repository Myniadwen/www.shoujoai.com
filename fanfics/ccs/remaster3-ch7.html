Sakura/Tomoyo&#146;s Bedroom.

The words didn&#146;t seem to want to come out, but Tomoyo had to say them.

&quot;My night visions--- were of that day.&#147; Tomoyo whispers, looking 
Sakura in the eye. &#147;But the worst ones--- was when I dreamed you came 
to my rescue--- and father raped you in my place.&#147;

&#147;R-r-really?&#147; she asked, to which Tomoyo nodded her head. &#147;You would 
throw yourself at him, trying to attack him instead of use magic and 
he&#146;d bat you away. Then--- oh goddess--- as he&#146;d undress me you&#146;d 
tackle me and--- present yourself to him.&#147;

&#147;W-why?&#147;

&#147;Because it&#146;s my fear. I feared if you were there--- you&#146;d have done 
something noble to spare me--- even if it meant letting father---&#147;

Sakura nodded, her body feeling numb even in Tomoyo&#146;s grasp. She 
wanted to turn away, but kept staring straight ahead. &quot;I wish I could 
have--- to spare you---&#147; She was cut off when Tomoyo put her hand on 
Sakura&#39;s mouth. &quot;Don&#39;t say it. It hurts just to think of you, so noble 
and brave, holding my eyes tight even as he&#146;s--- savaging you--- and 
crying out &#147;Don&#146;t cry! Don&#146;t cry! I love you! I love you! Don&#146;t 
cry!&#147;... I&#39;m not sorry what happened to father. And, if he had hurt 
you--- I would have killed him myself.&quot;

Tomoyo whispered the last part, bringing a shocked look to Sakura&#145;s 
face. Suddenly, her face brightened a little. &quot;But I&#146;m also sad for 
losing him. I wanted with all my heart to save him--- from himself 
perhaps, but I didn&#145;t want him to die alone. I shouldn&#146;t have run. I 
was afraid he&#146;d take me again--- but if it meant he&#146;d be alive today, 
and maybe on a path to redemption, I would have let him have me as 
many times as I had to --- just if only so he wouldn&#146;t have died such 
a lonely death. I could have... I don&#39;t know why I had to tell you, 
especially because it hurts you so. But I should have done something 
to make you feel better.&quot;

Sakura shook her head. &quot;No--- I needed to hear it. I loved every 
minute we had. You have always been my best friend, and my beloved.&quot; 
Sakura looked at her with sad eyes. &quot;I won&#146;t let anyone hurt our 
daughter. I won&#146;t let it happen to her.&#147; Tomoyo, wide eyed, suddenly 
let out a laugh which utterly confused the heck out of Sakura. &quot;It&#39;s 
not like your going to harm our precious, Sakura!&#148;

&#147;Pwhee?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re her father, remember?&#148; Tomoyo chided her gently, tapping her 
on the forehead. &#147;Not directly at least, but you are her father. And 
I&#146;m her mother. I don&#39;t even know how we&#146;ll explain it all when the 
time comes.&quot;

Sakura looks at Tomoyo curiously. &#147;Explain?&#148;

&#147;The birds and the bees. Sex.&#147; (Sakura looked confused) &#147;I didn&#146;t tell 
her much. She knows about--- well, about the rubbing, and the licking 
part but--- real REAL sex is still not in her grasp. We still have to 
give her the &#147;talk&#148; about it---&#147; (pauses abit to think before she says 
her next words) &#147;How did your father explain about the birds and the 
bees?&#148; Sakura blushed and smiled. &quot;Well...&quot; Tomoyo smiled in turn, 
hugging Sakura. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t get mad. I just want to know.&quot; 
Sakura looked at her, her face turning entirely red before she finally 
whispers &quot;You taught me.&#147;

Tomoyo looked at her with her genuine shock before she recovers, then 
smiles. &quot;So I was your first and your teacher to boot in lovemaking? I 
hope I didn&#39;t gross you out or anything when we first made love. It 
was just you were there so close to me and...&quot; Sakura smiled. &quot;I 
didn&#146;t mind. You didn&#146;t gross me out, Tomoyo-chan.&quot; She blushed again 
and mumbled, &quot;In fact it was like you whisk me off to heaven everytime 
we make love.&#148; Sakura looked up at her and smiled. &quot;It was a bit of a 
turn on in fact.&quot;

With that it was like a weight was lifted from Tomoyo&#146;s shoulders. 
&quot;Well you make me feel the same when you make love to me, so we&#146;re 
even I suppose.&quot; She looked directly into Sakura&#39;s eyes and winked. 
Sakura blushed, then remembered that this was Tomoyo and at any second 
something could happen.

Sakura, however, beat Tomoyo to the punch this time as she leaned 
closer to her as she closed her eyes and puckered her lips slightly. 
She felt Tomoyo&#39;s warm breath on her lip and stopped, half an inch 
away from her. Then, as she let her anticipate for a few seconds, she 
leaned forward and pressed her lips against Tomoyo&#39;s. Tomoyo let out a 
small moan and pushed back. Sakura felt something move against her 
mouth and realized it was her tongue. Then she opened her mouth and 
felt it slide in. Sakura let out a slight moan, and her hands held 
Tomoyo tightly.

&#147;I love you Sakura.&quot; Sakura put her arms around Tomoyo, holding her 
tight.

&quot;I love you too, Tomo-chan&quot;

They talked until the sun began to set and it was time to make dinner. 
Tonight Sakura cooked for Tomoyo and did her best job, after which the 
two retired and watched TV for awhile before crawling back into bed 
and turning to each other.

They would fall asleep soon, in each other&#146;s arms--- but not now as 
they reached out and drew each other together for another kiss before 
they made love.

Later, she sang the song again, Figure Eight, with Sakura her 
attentive audience.

Figure Eight, as double four.

Figure Four, as half of eight.

If you skate, you would be great, if you could make--- a Figure Eight.

That&#146;s a circle that turns &#145;round upon itself.

1x8 is 2x4, 4x4 is 2x8.

If you skate upon thin ice, you&#146;d be wise if you thought twice--- 
before you make another single move.

As she sings the equations, Sakura takes note--- she was still not 
that great on her mathematics as she wanted to be. PE she was good at, 
math was a whole different story.

Tomoyo finished the equations part and rounded to the finish.

Figure Eight, as double four.

Figure Four, as half of eight.

If you skate, you would be great, if you could make--- a Figure Eight.

That&#146;s a circle that turns &#145;round upon itself---

Tomoyo reaches out and traces a sideways circle on Sakura&#146;s chest.

Place it on it&#146;s side and it&#146;s a symbol meaning--- infinity.

The two kiss again and hold each other tight.

Friday, December 27th, 2002

Sakura hefted her backpack as she and Tomoyo walked hand in hand away 
from the Daidouji Estates. Today, in their opinion, was a good day. 
The sun was up, it was abit cool but warm enough for a picnic, and the 
snow was just deep enough for a snowball fight after lunch. They 
stopped when they heard someone call their names. Turning around they 
saw Rena Daisuki and her companion Trinity walk up.

Sakura smiled and waved, &quot;Hi, what&#39;s up?&quot; The two stopped and looked 
at them for a second, then Rena asked, &quot;Are you two alright? I heard 
about the fall Tomoyo took last Sunday--- she&#146;s OK, right?&#147; Sakura 
smiled and looked at Tomoyo, the two exchanging nods and positive 
signs. &quot;She&#146;s fine. She&#146;s fine. We&#39;ve been working some things out, 
but it&#145;s nothing we can&#145;t handle together.&quot; At that Rena and Trinity 
smiled and made varying sounds of acknowledgement. Trinity smiled at 
them, &quot;So you two are going for a picky-nicky, huh?&quot; Sakura and Tomoyo 
looked at her slightly surprised. &quot;You... you mean you knew?&quot; Tomoyo 
asked.

Rena rolled her eyes and tapped the basket with a free hand, &#147;Either 
that or somebody&#146;s grandmother is about to be eaten by a large 
slobbering Galerian. Methinks&#146; it&#146;s just a &#147;picky-nicky&#148; like Trinity 
said though. Right?&#148; (Rena changes the subject) &#147;How is Nina, anyway? 
Did Amazon-dot-com girl actually say yes to her umpteenth marriage 
proposal or are they not speaking to each other anymore?&#148;

&quot;Well---&#148; Sakura blushes, face turning bright red at the thought, &#147;I 
think the only people who don&#39;t know that they&#146;re marrying is---&#147;

&#147;Me?&#147;

&#147;---and maybe Meilin and Xai but that&#145;s only because they don&#145;t seem 
to care.&#148; Tomoyo threw in just in case Rena wanted to know. &#147;We were 
all actually wondering when those two were going to get together, but 
nobody in the house wanted to say anything in case we were wrong.&quot; 
Tomoyo finished, giggling.

&#147;Don&#146;t blame you.&#147; Rena agreed, nodding her head at Tomoyo&#146;s remark, 
&#147;Nina can be awfully frightening when she&#146;s in a bad mood. Best not to 
irk her when it looks like her mood is going fast south. Keiko told me 
that she heard you two walked in on them making love once---&#147; Sakura 
and Madison were blushing bright red, the memory of the incident so 
emblazoned in memory that it made them turn cherry red everytime they 
even came near to thinking of it. &quot;Don&#39;t sweat it, you two have 
nothing to be embarrassed about. It&#146;s a little difficult to get used 
to Eliza being who she is, Amazonian and all. I mean, you know what I 
mean! Right?&quot; The other girls all nodded in agreement and made similar 
comforting remarks, mostly to not think of Eliza in bed. Sakura and 
Tomoyo both smile at them, &quot;Thanks guys&#133;&#148; Sakura says first, &#147;We were 
a little nervous about it. I mean--- it was an accident and all but--- 
how would you react?&quot;

&#147;Badly.&#147; Rena sighed. &#147;Walking in on the sight of Nina lying beneath 
Eliza and--- well, it&#146;s not something I foster in terms of an actual 
thought to have now, I assure you.&#147;

After a while the foursome broke apart and began heading in different 
directions. As they walked to New King Penguin Park, the two were 
quiet for a while. Then Sakura looked over at Tomoyo. &quot;That was... 
awkward. Thinking about Nina and Eliza.&quot; Tomoyo nods her head. 
&quot;Imagine how they feel talking about us---&#147; (stops as she realized she 
said something bad) &#147;I mean I&#146;m sure Nina doesn&#146;t talk about us as 
much as Adri says she does, and I&#146;m sure she had no idea that--- I&#39;m 
sorry---&quot; Sakura smiles and shakes her head, realizing she must have 
had an angry look on her face. &quot;Don&#39;t be sorry. Nina&#146;s had it out for 
me ever since she showed up. At least Rena, who used to hate me, is 
coming around to being rather nice&quot; Tomoyo thinks about that for a 
second before replying, &#147;Only when it&#146;s not work and she&#146;s not 
stressed out.&#148;

As they enter the park, Tomoyo leans against Sakura&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I 
guess it could have been worse.&quot; She smiled and looked at Sakura&#39;s 
face. &quot;We might have walked in and the two might have tried to lure us 
into bed.&quot; Sakura shudders and goes into complete shock in front of 
Tomoyo before blurting out &#147;Don&#146;t say that!!&#147;

Tomoyo smirks at her reaction, &quot;I don&#39;t know. They were both looking 
rather cozy together and you know how inspired I was with you for the 
weeks after we saw that.&#147;

&#147;Don&#39;t worry about it, Tomoyo-chan.&quot; Sakura points out, relenting to 
Tomoyo&#145;s thoughts on the subject. &#147;If we ever need &#147;inspiration&#148; again 
I guess we can peek in on them--- if it doesn&#146;t do more harm than good 
that is.&#148;

When they arrived at the huge King Penguin slide, where they were 
going to picnic, they spotted Misho NamoCatCat (in a huff) who was 
sitting on the highest point of the slide. Misho didn&#146;t even notice 
they were below, she simply sat there and pouted, her tail whipping 
about in a mad frenzy as she fumed silently.

Clearly she wasn&#146;t in a good mood, and neither of them wanted to 
disturb her. However, at that moment as they were about to retreat, 
she looked down at them and huffed her breath. &quot;What are you two up 
to?&quot;

Sakura smiled at her. &quot;We&#39;re just going to--- ahhh---&#147; (thinks of how 
Trinity put it for a second) &#147;We&#146;re going to &#147;picky-nicky&#148; here and 
then go build a snowfort. Want to hang out with us for abit?&quot; Misho 
nods her head miserably and slides off the top of King Penguin to join 
them. As she nimbly hit&#146;s the ground, her tail still swinging 
fiercely, she passes them and sits down on a nice bench near the slide 
and motions for them to join her. &quot;Alright, you were right and I was 
wrong, happy Tomoyo? They were going to make me move the dance to 
Sunday, just as you thought.&quot;

Tomoyo nodded her head as Misho passed her by, &quot;Well at least they 
didn&#146;t make you pay extra for it.&quot; To which Misho looked at her with a 
rather grim expression on her face. &quot;No, not yet anyway. I&#39;m actually 
wondering if they did it just to charge me extra for the space I&#146;m 
renting for the dance. Damn Convention Center is so full of jackals 
and hyenas!&#148; Misho began fuming, her fists balling up as she did, &#147;I 
wonder if it&#146;s even worth it to tell the Edenina Better Business 
Bureau about this!!&quot; Tomoyo passes some food to Misho (she brought 
enough for four people) as they begin to eat. &quot;I think if you just let 
things play out with the Convention Center people it&#146;ll all turn out 
for the best soon enough.&quot; She playfully kissed Sakura&#39;s cheek, then 
started to eat her lunch as Sakura began on the food Tomoyo set before 
her.

Misho suddenly whips out a calculator and starts on it. &quot;The logistics 
of it is right on mind you, but what they&#146;re charging me is like 
they&#146;re double billing me for stuff I already paid for. Here, want to 
look---&#147;

&#147;Oh I hate math!&quot; Sakura explodes, to which Tomoyo offers to take the 
calculator herself. &quot;Well in that case I&#146;ll get it over with fast 
alright?&quot; Sakura sighed and Tomoyo began crunching the numbers Misho 
had written down earlier. A few minutes later she gives the notes back 
with a few handwritten notes of her own. &quot;I&#146;ll be damned---&#147; Misho 
whistles in admiration as she looks at the papers. &#147;She balanced it 
AND pointed the errors out in less than five minutes! That&#146;s some math 
skill you have.&#147;

&quot;It&#146;s a little thing for someone who runs her own animation studio. Do 
you want anything else to eat?&quot; Misho shook her head no and picked up 
all the notes, putting them back into a pouch she had slung over her 
shoulder. After a minute, she reached into her pouch and took out the 
flier for the dance. It was modified to show the new date on it. &#147;I 
already e-mailed everyone whose going to tell them the change, and had 
this special delivered to the rest. You two were last on my list and I 
was going to drop it off---&#148; She jumps when she feels someone tap her 
on the shoulder. Misho spins about and finds Captain Lazarus smiling 
down at her. &quot;You OK, Misho? That was quite a jump--- sorry if I 
spooked you. My bad.&#148;

&quot;Yeah, no problem--- only shaved 2 years off my lifespan but I have 
700 or so years so I&#146;m good to go, so to speak. What can I do for you 
today, Mr. Captain-man.&#148;

Jack sits down next to her, giving Tomoyo &amp; Sakura a healthy greeting 
(which they return) before taking out a data pad and showing it to 
her. &quot;If I wanted this job done as soon as possible, can it be done?&quot; 
Misho looked it over, at first casually then with an increasing degree 
of seriousness. Finally she nods her head, and carefully pushes the 
pad back into Jack&#146;s hand. &quot;Consider it done.&quot; Jack taps Misho on the 
shoulder and thanks her, &#147;Hey, no problem Mr. Captain-man. See you 
around.&#147; Suddenly, a thought came to Misho. &#147;Do you two have your 
dresses?&#148;

&quot;No problem.&#148; Tomoyo answers, &#147;I just finished Sakura&#146;s dress last 
night.&quot; 

At that, a memory flashes into Sakura&#146;s head

-----

Sakura&#146;s Flashback

Wednesday (Christmas Night)

Christmas was over, and the celebrating winding down--- but for 
Tomoyo, work is never done--- especially when it involves Sakura. As 
Sakura&#146;s prodding, Tomoyo shakes her head, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I 
think I have the perfect idea for a dress for you. I&#145;ll have it done 
in two days.&quot; Sakura held up her hand. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about me! You need 
a dress for the dance!&quot; At that Tomoyo&#146;s smile broadens considerably 
as she nods her head. &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll remember Sakura. Don&#145;t worry!&quot; 
They both kissed and hugged. &quot;This is going to be perfect. My best 
design yet!&quot; Tomoyo whispers in Sakura&#39;s ear. Sakura smiled and 
whispers back. &quot;I can&#145;t wait.&quot;

Tomoyo presses closer, running her hand down Sakura&#39;s back. Sakura 
smiled and kissed the nape of Tomoyo&#39;s neck. She gasps slightly and 
closes her eyes. Sakura starts kissing Tomoyo&#146;s collar bone when she 
feels Tomoyo&#39;s hand squeeze her butt and---

-----

&#147;EEP!&#147;

Tomoyo quickly opens her eyes and looked at Sakura. &quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry. Are 
you alright Sakura?&quot; Sakura nods her head vigorously. &quot;I&#39;m fine, you 
just startled me is all. In fact I&#39;m feeling a little bit better than 
fine.&quot;

&#147;I&#146;m not.&#148; Misho remarks blandly, standing up. &#147;I have better things 
to do than watch you two making out.&#148; (she walks off) &#147;At least go 
inside of King Penguin and use the little control device Nina put in 
for a privacy shield! I heard she sometimes does it with Eliza in 
there---&#148; (Misho makes a sound like she was about to hack up a 
furball) &#147;Whatever.&#148;

------

Meanwhile

Alliance Command Center - Citadel City

It was about nearly a day behind of Tokyo, but time still marched on.

The huge screens of the &#147;pit&#148; area showed the ever widening rift in 
&#147;Elsespace&#148;, and the clock counted down the minutes and hours before 
the estimated &#147;emergence&#148; of the Dyson Sphere from &#147;Otherspace&#148; was to 
take place.

Everyone knew of &#147;Elsespace&#148; (the limitless void of &#147;nothing&#148; that 
was, in fact, the underlying &#147;layer&#148; of real space (in reality), but 
very few people knew of &#147;Otherspace&#148;.

Otherspace, for a lack of a better term, was the layers between 
dimensions. It acted like a buffer between each overlapping reality 
and it&#146;s subsequent &#147;Elsespace&#148; layer where it&#146;s &#147;dream&#148; and 
&#147;nightmare&#148; realities were layered.

While Elsespace was easy enough to explain, a white &#147;void&#148; which 
buffered reality from the subtle layer of &#147;non-reality&#148; beneath, 
Otherspace was something much harder to explain. Consider it the 
&#147;alley&#148; between the two outer walls surrounding properties. Each 
property within the wall would be, for the sake of the example, a 
&#147;dimension&#148;. The &#147;path&#148; between the &#147;dimensions&#148; (the buffer zone) 
would then represent &#147;Otherspace&#148;. Hence, it is conceivable, that 
something could travel &#147;through&#148; Otherspace (as someone would travel 
through that path between walled properties. And, if the example is 
carried one step further, something could &#147;sit&#148; in &#147;Otherspace&#148; while 
attempting to &#147;access&#148; one of these &#147;properties&#148; (dimensions) which is 
what was happening right now. The Dyson Sphere in question no doubt 
was sitting snugly between the two &#147;properties&#148; (in Otherspace) while 
the rift was opening into Elsespace.

That, in a nutshell, comprised up the many papers sitting in front of 
Admiral Nobringa at this moment. A lot of discussion and debate about 
WHERE the Dyson Sphere was, but not HOW it was there, or the more 
important question of WHY.

For all the importance the files were when given to her, they didn&#146;t 
seem to important now after much reflection on their contents. In 
fact, they seemed rather useless. Suddenly she felt someone&#146;s presence 
over her shoulder and she sighed. &#147;Doing the Dominion&#146;s work? Don&#146;t 
you have your own command center to sit in and people to bother with?&#148;

&#147;But that wouldn&#146;t be nearly as fun as dropping in on my little 
sister&#146;s new lover.&#148; Captain Kaichi Thrawles responded. He was a 
rather tall and dignified looking gentlemen, sporting the crimson red 
uniforms of the Dominion Republica, he was an imposing figure yet he 
also had this gentleness to him which made people feel at ease around 
him. As he sat down, Rei&#146;chal shoves the paperwork in front of herself 
to him. &#147;Here, knock yourself out why dontcha&#146;.&#148;

As he pours over the notes, and someone from above brings him a coffee 
(and her a soda), he remarks on the notations. &#147;It&#146;s pretty much the 
same stuff we&#146;re getting from our Mars base only with more details of 
the opening rate because of your closeness to it.&#148;

&#147;Gee, that makes me feel loads better for handing Alliance information 
over to you.&#148; Nobringa scoffed as she took a draw of her drink, &#147;Care 
to toss a bone my way?&#148;

&#147;Thought you&#146;d never ask.&#148; he smiled, pulling a data rod out and 
spinning it her way as he spoke, &#147;We tried sending a probe in while 
yours sat about monitoring from a distance. It was destroyed as it 
entered &#147;Otherspace&#148;.&#148;

&#147;So we noted when there was a bright flash and little bits of probe 
came back out the opening. Anything new to that?&#148;

&#147;Play the rod and find out.&#148; he remarked, pointing at the rod in her 
hand. As she did this he looked around the room, &#147;Where&#146;s Kismet?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s shopping for dinner tonight. There was no real need for her to 
hang around here all day, and I didn&#146;t feel like eating the Commissary 
food tonight so I&#146;m taking my chances with home cooking.&#148;

&#147;Whose? Yours or her&#146;s?&#148;

&#147;Does she have any home cooking you can tell me about?&#148;

&#147;Touche&#146;.&#148; he relented with a smirk, &#147;She was a born replicator addict 
it seems.&#148;

&#147;So I noticed--- here we go, I&#146;m putting it up on the main screen.&#148;

As the two turned, the biggest screen at the top of the &#147;pit&#148; lit up. 
It showed a grainy video of the rift growing wider and wider as the 
source of the images (a Dominion Probe) moved closer to it. As it 
passed through the rift&#146;s opening and began to enter Otherspace it 
began to pick up images.

The surface seemed a bright metallic silver, with what seemed to be 
large bulges in the surface. As the probe moved closer there was 
activity on the screen, streaks of light dancing across the image to 
which Nobringa said &#147;Lightning?&#148;

&#147;No. Watch---&#148;

As the image grew clearer, and the mounds began to show more clearly, 
there was a flash of light and then nothing. Silence reigned for a few 
seconds before Captain Thrawles spoke again. &#147;That, our techs 
theorize, was an energy build up for a defense cannon.&#148;

&#147;The mounds?&#148;

&#147;Perhaps. Or perhaps the mounds are cannon placements. We didn&#146;t get 
enough data to make sure, but there is one thing we did get, a partial 
reading of the surface&#146;s make-up--- here.&#148; (he pushes a few buttons 
and brings a new screen up, bringing everyone&#146;s attention to the new 
data)

&#147;The surface is made up of--- what the---&#148; (looks at notes) &#147;Looks 
like the computer said &#147;Modified Tritanium&#148; and somebody wrote below 
it--- &#147;Quadrinanium?&#148;&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s an experimental new metal.&#148; Thrawles pointed out, &#147;Both our 
sides have been tinkering with it. The theory is that a basic sheet of 
Tritanium can be made 500% stronger by &#147;crushing&#148; the atoms together 
of the sheets until they were solidly packed together tightly, forming 
a hard unbreakable surface.&#148;

&#147;But that never worked because the atoms wouldn&#146;t hold at such a 
tightened impacted state without coming apart. I&#146;ve seen test footage 
of this from during the Great War of whole ships shattering from the 
stress of trying to create &#147;Quadrinanium&#148;. It can&#146;t physically be 
done, it&#146;s a pipe dream.&#148;

&#147;So what is that?&#148;

Nobringa looks up at the screen, &#147;It only says &#147;Modified Tritanium&#148;. 
So?&#148;

&#147;So the sensors aren&#146;t made to look for something that the computers 
think is a &#147;pipe dream&#148;, remember?&#148; (a few seconds pass before 
realization hits) &#147;So it would mark it as something it knows, in this 
case &#147;Modified&#148;---&#148;

&#147;Tritanium. I see, I see.&#148; she concluded. &#147;So is this really 
&#147;Quadrinanium&#148;? The only way we&#146;ll really know is to grab a sample, 
and good luck doing that since the last &#147;emissary&#148; we sent was blown 
away before it got close enough for a souvenir.&#148;

&#147;And it wouldn&#146;t be easy to simply burn a piece off if it is 
Quadrinanium.&#148;

&#147;So---&#148; (Nobringa turns towards Thrawles with a serious expression, 
&#147;Got any ideas because I&#146;m all burned out of good ideas at the 
moment.&#148;

Meanwhile, back at the Daidouji Estates

Kero stuck his head out of the kitchen just then. &quot;Hey, can I have 
some more?&quot;

Sakura sighed and nodded. &quot;Alright, but this is it until dinner 
alright?&quot;

Kero, with Cloud in tow, marched into the kitchen and she grabbed some 
cookies and poured the two some chocolate milk. As they sat down to 
eat, Sakura watched them and smiled. The two were hitting it off 
rather nicely for a pair who did nothing but argue about who was 
beating who at video games. Maybe what Mirra said about them having 
&#147;feelings&#148; for each other really was true--- just maybe.

Or maybe they were just refueling for another grudge match of video 
games.

Either way, as long as they were at peace now that was all that 
mattered.

Cloud ate two fisted, a cookie in each hand as she bit from 
alternating hands, drank (from her straw) and chewed (repeat). Kero 
was more a nibble chew munch and then drink kind of being, he didn&#146;t 
take on both cookies at once.

It was then that Umi walked in and spied the two. &#147;So how is the 
hopeless lovebirds anyway?&#148;

Kero scowled, &#147;Is that anyway to speak of Sakura?&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t mean Mistress, I meant you and Cloud.&#148; Umi shot back, 
causing Kero to fume and glow bright red from the comment. &#147;---none of 
your business---&#148;

Sunday, December 28th, 2002

With now only hours left before the year end dance, Sakura was 
nervous.

Tomoyo had worked for two days straight on the dress, and Sakura 
worried that she was overworking herself so soon after the incident on 
the ice. But, as Sonomi pointed out, Tomoyo worked best under 
pressure. She worked diligently on their dresses until at last 
Saturday rolled about and they were done.

Sakura didn&#146;t have much to do on Saturday, or Sunday for that matter, 
but feed Kero and Cloud. They didn&#145;t mind the extra food while Sakura 
was in her nervous mode, and Kero did everything he could to avoid 
Sakura&#145;s pointed questions. She knew that Kero helped Tomoyo with the 
dress making this time out and he knew exactly what the dress way, but 
Tomoyo had strictly forbidden Sakura to look at it early. In fact, she 
took so much precautions that she &#147;borrowed&#148; (with Nina&#146;s help) two 
huge containment cylinders from the set of Pink Panties (the title 
Nina worked on normally as a fictional) to store the completed dresses 
until it was time for the dance. Still, the strongly locked and 
secured cylinders didn&#146;t keep Sakura from pondering all day as to 
their contents.

All day Sunday left Sakura imagining the contents of the cylinder with 
her name on it (printed in bright neon letters on the display screen 
of the cylinder&#146;s lock mechanism) which sat in their bedroom. As for 
the contents of the cylinders? She asked Tomoyo for even the slightest 
hint before bed on Saturday night, and even promises of extra cuddles 
did nothing to dissuade Tomoyo from keeping the dresses a secret. 
&quot;Believe me, it suits you.&quot;

Finally, on the last day, Sakura had just had to take her word for it. 
It was better than pushing her luck with Tomoyo&#146;s patience anyway. 
Before getting the datakey Nina left with her (half anyway, which 
Sakura had finally managed to &#147;talk&#148; the accompanying second half out 
of Nina by bothering her all day until she finally threw the key at 
Sakura in a fit and stormed off in a huff), and locking the two pieces 
together to open the cylinder. Before she did that, however, she 
checked on the Clow cards and told them what was going on. She had 
found that, if she didn&#39;t report her day to them, they would float out 
of the book and circle her head until she did. Finally the cards were 
totally informed (both Original cards and FanCreated cards) and they 
went back into the book. As Sakura went to her cylinder, she felt abit 
nervous about opening it up. Sakura clicked the keycard into the slot 
where Nina indicated it had to go, and pushed it in hard to trigger 
the lock to open. As she slowly peered through the cylinder door just 
a bit, she saw the dress and gasped. It was the most beautiful thing 
Tomoyo had even made for her.

Reaching into the cylinder she drew the dress out and laid it on the 
bed. The material was bright gold (a soft flowing material that Tomoyo 
had bought from the town in the Gold Isle near the Grimmlands (the 
dream continent created by the dreams of the Brothers&#146; Grimm) while on 
their school fieldtrip. Though, to be more precise, it is more 
accurate to say that several merchants in town snuck into the school&#146;s 
camp ground to see Tomoyo with their wares having heard she, a 
daughter of a major Japanese business woman, was visiting their 
island).

The dress wascut low in the front and back, but obviously not showing 
too much of Sakura&#146;s maturing breasts. Long sleeves ended in attached 
golden finger covers for her ring and middle fingers. The bottom half 
was in three layers, with a silver edge running along the hems of the 
entire dress. Running her fingers across it Sakura was amazed at how 
soft it felt, and remembered that the material was the same type used 
in Judgment and Alliance Officer uniforms (Keiko told her about the 
cloth once when Tomoyo first bought the gold and silver materials 
during that trip along with a few other things).

She also noticed that there were matching shoes in the box and some 
gold elfin silk stockings and a silver hair band. &quot;Tomoyo, you think 
of everything.&quot; She smiled and set everything out on the bed with the 
dress. Sakura couldn&#39;t wait to put it on, but realized that first 
she&#39;d need to shower.

Tossing her clothes on the floor she ran to the bath room. Starting 
the shower she waited a few seconds until it was warm then jumped in. 
As the water ran down her body Sakura scrubbed herself clean from head 
to toe, amazed how quickly the water warmed (faster than back at her 
old home). Then, as she started to rinse off, her eyes were drawn to 
the toilet. The memory of that night she had seen Tomoyo in the 
bathroom--- And then the thoughts of her father---- came back into her 
mind.

Unconsciously her hand slid between her legs and traced slow circles 
through the small tuft of pubic hair she had. She closed her eyes and 
bit her lip as her hand slid just a bit lower... then she shook her 
head and stopped. There&#146;d be time enough for that in Tomoyo&#146;s arms, 
she had to get ready. Just the thought of it made her shiver in a 
combination of anticipation and uncertainty. Turning off the shower 
Sakura stepped out and grabbed a towel, making sure to dry everything 
as well as she could. Then she put on the soft underclothes she got 
from Eliza (Alliance Officers got to wear the softest stuff!) and 
stood in front of the mirror.

She couldn&#39;t do much with her short hair, not like the styles 
Tomoyo-chan could pull off, but she promised to try something special 
anyway. Reaching for the hair drier and comb she got to work, 
utilizing a few tricks Adri (the medical officer friend of Nina&#146;s) 
taught her on the times they talked together. When she finished she 
had managed to make her hair look a little lighter than usual and had 
slipped on the silver hair band Madison had left for her. At last she 
felt like it was time to put on the dress.
