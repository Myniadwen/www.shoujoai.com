<h1>Revolutionary Girl Sakura (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/sakura-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;You know Arisugawa Juri, the fencing captain?&quot; Tomoyo asked, her eyes 
practically bugging out. The two of them were grabbing lunch at the 
cafeteria, and Juri had given them a respectful nod in passing.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sakura answered in an absent minded way, &quot;she fell under the 
control of the Desire Card. It got her into a situation involving a 
girl with a bad reputation, Takatsuki Shiori, that I helped get her 
out of.&quot;

Sakura looked off in the distance, remembering. It had been her first 
capture at Ohtori, and she had heard about it in such a strange 
way....

The girl sitting next to her scowled and grumbled under her breath, 
&quot;What is she doing with that girl?&quot;

Sakura looked over at her thoughtfully. &quot;What girl?&quot; she asked 
quietly.

Nanami gave Sakura a distainful look, but she couldn&#39;t resist passing 
on good gossip. &quot;The fencing captain has taken up with a junior named 
Shiori,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Everyone says Juri&#39;s taken leave of her 
senses.&quot;

Sakura&#39;s face went white, even as she said &quot;As if something&#39;s 
controlling her.&quot;

Nanami looked at her in surprise, then she nodded slowly. &quot;You could 
be right,&quot; she whispered.

After classes, Sakura made her way down the halls to the fencing hall. 
She could feel her skin prickle, and knew one of the cards was nearby. 
She opened the main doors and stepped inside, only to gasp in 
surprise.

Shiori was pressed up against the wall as Juri nibbled at her neck. 
Her hands were moving feverishly against the front of Shiori&#39;s shirt, 
even as Shiori babbled huskily in pleasure. Sakura took it all in, and 
instantly jumped to the wrong conclusion.

&quot;Juri, let her go!&quot; she cried. Juri ignored her, but Shiori glared at 
her. Sakura pulled out the sword and began to chant:

&quot;Oh Sword of Dios,

Power of magic, power of Right!

Surrender the Blade, the sword of Light!

Release!&quot;

Sakura ran forward and pulled Juri away from Shiori&#39;s fevered grasp. 
Rose in place, Sakura pointed her blade at Juri, &quot;Surrender the card! 
We don&#39;t have to do this.&quot; Sakura felt the evil presence behind her 
just in time, ducking and rolling underneath the wild swing. Shiori 
smiled at Sakura, sword in hand as she looked at Sakura with eyes 
glazed with an unholy passion.

&quot;Juri is mine,&quot; Shiori said in throaty tones. &quot;You can&#39;t have her.&quot; 
She raises and points her wicked looking sword at Sakura. &quot;And you&#39;re 
mine too.&quot;

Sakura cried out, even as she felt the power of the card slide over 
her. Shiori&#39;s form flickered, changing, and Sakura saw another girl, a 
stranger to her, with long dark hair, delicate features, and lively 
eyes. &acirc;&#128;&#152;Is she what I desire?&#39; Sakura wondered. She shook her head, 
struggling. The image flickered then wavered. &quot;You don&#39;t own me!&quot; 
Sakura gasped out, and Shiori cried out as the spell was broken.

Juri, her mind free as well, was also looking at Shiori with shock, 
and a bit of disgust. Shiori saw that look and cried out in pain and 
rage, &quot;How dare you!&quot; She charged the shaken Juri, sword point first, 
only to be stopped by Sakura&#39;s blade. She flicked her wrist, and 
Shiori&#39;s rose spun apart.

&quot;Desire Card!&quot; Sakura cried, as a glowing, female figure slid from 
Shiori&#39;s form. &quot;Return to your power confined! Desire!&quot; Sakura felt a 
hand sweep across her cheek, then the card dropped gracefully in her 
hand.

Shiori swayed, stumbled, and finally fell. Curling into a ball, she 
sobbed out, &quot;I love you, Juri. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Juri, shaken, walked over 
to her, knelt down beside her, and lightly patted her on the shoulder, 
a lost expression on her face.

------------------------------------------------------------

Sakura was jerked back to the present by the look on Tomoyo&#39;s face. 
Tomoyo blushed a bit, looking at her roommate with new eyes. &quot;So you 
don&#39;t have a problem with...&quot;

&quot;Nah.&quot; Sakura answered. She looked thoughtfully at the slightly 
shorter, good looking girl beside her. &quot;You know, you are the type she 
likes. Would you like me to introduce you?&quot;

Tomoyo blushed brightly. &quot;Ah, no, thanks, but she&#39;s not my type.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s O.K.,&quot; Sakura said cheerfully, &quot;she says that she&#39;s in love 
with somebody anyway. Won&#39;t tell me who, though.&quot; she finished with a 
frown.

Tomoyo looked over at Sakura worriedly. &quot;I wonder why?&quot; Tomoyo 
whispered. She changed the subject, &quot;Which are the cards left?&quot; she 
asked quietly.

&quot;The Dark and Light cards, the Mist, the Earth, and the Mirror cards 
are the only ones left. My research tells me the Dark and Light are 
always together, so I count them as one. The others are going to be 
trouble, though.&quot; Sakura said seriously.

&quot;Why is that?&quot; Tomoyo asked.

Sakura shrugged and laughed, &quot;This job&#39;s never that simple. So now I 
have to wait until I hear about another card.&quot;

Just then a quiet voice said &quot;Sakura?&quot; from behind. They turned to 
find Juri walking towards them with a slight smile on her aristocratic 
face.

&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve been introduced,&quot; Juri said, her eyes lighting up 
as she smiled at Tomoyo.

&quot;Down, girl.&quot; Sakura said dryly. &quot;This is my friend, Daidouji Tomoyo. 
Tomoyo, meet Arisugawa Juri.&quot;

Juri looked mildly startled by Tomoyo&#39;s name, but recovered quickly. 
&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; she said, smiling charmingly. She turned to 
Sakura, saying &quot;One of my fencers has a problem I think might be right 
up you&#39;re alley.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;d I tell you?&quot; Sakura said. Tomoyo sweatdropped, while Juri 
asked what was going on. </pre>
