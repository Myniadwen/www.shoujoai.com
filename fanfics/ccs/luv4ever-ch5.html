<h1>Love Forever (part 5 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Tomoyo got excited and said she was brimming with ideas about their new 
life together and the child they wanted to have. She told Sakura she was 
going to take a bath to relax and plan everything. Tomoyo did most of 
her thinking and planning that way. It almost as if everything became 
clearer and more detailed if she were in the tub. She grabbed a change 
of clothes and bounded for the bathroom. Sakura listened at the door as 
Tomoyo got in and thought this was her chance to repay her for all of 
her love and the pain she had caused her while she was in Hong Kong. She 
ran back to Tomoyo&#39;s room and rifled through her bags. She found what 
she was looking for and set it on the desk. It was the Clow book. Before 
she could open it, all of the cards sprang forth and started circling 
her head. As they often did when they wanted to know what was going on. 

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry I haven&#39;t been talking to you much lately. I can&#39;t 
remember the last time I told you what was happening, or even the last 
time I just said hello to all of you.&quot;

Sakura looked down ashamed and said that she wasn&#39;t worthy of their 
companionship. The cards responded by glowing and circling even closer. 
Sakura knew they were protesting her words with all their might.

&quot;As you probably guessed, we&#39;re not in Hong Kong anymore. Sayoran and I 
have broken up and right now I&#39;m staying with Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

The cards glowed even brighter and danced about as if to say they were 
happy for her.

&quot;Anyway, I&#39;ve asked Tomoyo to marry me... she&#39;s the one that I should 
have married in the first place. She&#39;s always loved me no matter what, 
and I caused her alot of pain when I ran off to Hong Kong. I want to do 
somthing very special for her, Tomoyo and I want to have a child, but I 
don&#39;t like the idea of planting someone else&#39;s sperm inside of her, it 
doesn&#39;t seem right to me. I have an idea of how to get around this, but 
I&#39;m going to need a little help.&quot;

She could feel the cards reaction in her heart. They loved Sakura and 
would do anything they could to help. Slowly, she stood up and asked the 
cards to form two circles around her. As they did, she reached inside 
her shirt and pulled out her key. She held it out at arms length and 
started to chant.

&quot;Key that hides the power of the stars! Show your true form before me! 
I, Sakura, command you under our contract! Release!&quot;

In a whirl of light, the key grew into her staff and she grasped it. She 
looked at the two circles surrounding her and without even moving, she 
made a card float into her hand. She turned it over and hugged it 
tightly.

&quot;Please, please help me. I want to give something very precious to my 
beloved. I want to make her happy. I want to give her a child. A 
daughter.&quot;

Sakura hugged the card even tighter as she started crying.

&quot;Please, give me a child to love and to nurture. Give Tomoyo something 
she thought she could never have... Hope.&quot;

Another flash of light and the magical seal under her feet was 
duplicated in front of her. With all her heart, she willed it to get 
smaller and smaller. Her knees grew weak at the stregnth it took to use 
this much magic all at once. She almost collapsed, but was given what 
seemed to be an endless amount of energy as the cards tried their 
hardest to give all of their power to the mistress of the cards. She got 
it as small as she could and pulled it towards her. She put her arms out 
to her sides and the seal moved to her stomach, stopping for only a 
moment as it dissapeared inside of her. As quickly as it came, the light 
and the seal were gone. Sakura took a deep breath, then collapsed as the 
remainder of her stregnth dissapeared. Before she hit the floor, the 
Float card appeared and stopped her. It smiled at her and gently laid 
her down on the bed. After giving her a kiss on the cheek, Float 
returned to it&#39;s card form and joined the others in the book.

&quot;Thank You.&quot; She whispered in her sleep.
