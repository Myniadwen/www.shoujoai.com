<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Sakura fell asleep in the car and awoke to Tomoyo&#39;s hand on her cheek.

&quot;Tom... Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;Morning sleepy head.&quot;

&quot;Where are we?&quot; Asked Sakura.

&quot;It&#39;s a surprise.&quot;

Tomoyo pulled into an underground lot and parked the car. She got out 
and ran around to open Sakura&#39;s door.

&quot;It&#39;s ok Tomoyo... I&#39;m fine now.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I was just tired, that&#39;s all.&quot;

They got into an elevator and Tomoyo pushed the button for the 4th 
floor. It started going up and when it reached the 1st floor, Sakura 
knew exactly where they were.

&quot;The mall?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I have something that I want to show you.&quot;

The elevator stopped on the 4th floor and they stepped out. Tomoyo took 
Sakura&#39;s hand and led her to a part of the mall that overlooked the food 
court.

&quot;Now, close your eyes.&quot;

Sakura did, wondering what her friend had in store for her now. She led 
Sakura around a corner and stopped in front of one of the shops.

&quot;Ok... open!&quot; 

She pulled her hands away from Sakura&#39;s eyes and put them on her 
shoulders.

&quot;Wow! This is beautiful! But, why are we here? You&#39;re not going to buy 
me a new wardrobe are you?&quot;

&quot;Look at the name silly.&quot;

DAIDOUJI CLOTHING INC.

It was Tomoyo&#39;s store! Sakura always knew Tomoyo would be a fashion 
designer someday, but this! This was too much!

&quot;Come on!&quot; Chirped Tomoyo as she grabbed Sakura&#39;s hand and dragged her 
into the store. Everywhere she looked, Sakura could see something new. 
There were shoes, Pants,   and Shirts. Handbags, Dresses, and 
Accessories, there was something for everyone! Clothes for Man, Woman, 
and Child!

&quot;This way!&quot; Said Tomoyo. She led them to a beautiful upstairs office 
overlooking the store.

&quot;Can I get you ladies something to drink?&quot; Asked one of the employees.

&quot;Yes. Can I please have a Diet soda?&quot; Asked Tomoyo.

&quot;And for you miss?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like one too please.&quot;

&quot;Right away.&quot;

&quot;Thank You!&quot; They both said.

Tomoyo sat down in her chair and watched as Sakura bounded to the window 
to look at all the busy people downstairs. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;What is it Sakura?&quot;

Her face flushed as she started talking.

&quot;Do...do you mind if I stay with you for a while until I can find my own 
place?&quot;

&quot;No! Not at all! Stay as long as you need! You know you&#39;re always 
welcome right?&quot;

&quot;Uh... uh-huh.&quot; She said while looking at the floor.

Tomoyo stood up and said that since they were there, they should get 
Sakura some cute new outfits. They headed downstairs to a private 
fitting area and got to work. Tomoyo sat on the couch while Sakura tried 
on outfit after outfit until she was too tired to continue. Sakura sat 
next to Tomoyo and looked at the massive pile of clothes that were now 
hers and asked why Tomoyo did this for her.

&quot;I don&#39;t know... but you&#39;re worth it I guess.&quot; Sakura looked at her 
friend and asked why she wasn&#39;t taping this like she normally would. 
&quot;But I am! I&#39;ll just make copies of the Security tapes later! So many 
different angles! I want to make sure I catch as much of Sakura-chan on 
tape as I can!&quot; Sakura blushed and sweatdropped.

Sakura scooted closer and gave Tomoyo a hug. Tomoyo looked at the pile 
of clothes and asked some of her employees if they could help carry them 
to her car.

&quot;Of course ma&#39;am. Right away.&quot;

They loaded the car and headed back to Tomoyo&#39;s, where they discussed 
whether or not Sakura should tell her family now that she was back, or 
wait until later.

&quot;I think that they&#39;ll figure it out sooner or later.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. You&#39;re always right Tomoyo.&quot;
