<h1>I Was Maid for Loving You</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/wjaegers.html">Wouter Jaegers</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The Daidouji household still was situated at the place where Tomoyo 
grew up, she guessed that aside from being her childhood home it was 
also the foundation of what kind of person she eventually would 
become. Mother always had female guards around who were with her 
regardless of what she did or where she went. Tomoyo wondered if they 
were the reason why she took a liking to the female gender. It was no 
choice she made it was just there and those sleek yet muscular bodies 
of her bodyguards made her look up to them, admire them and eventually 
she began fantasizing about them. 

But no matter how many of those babes were around, she knew that none 
of them would be able to give her what she craved, friendship. That 
changed when meeting Sakura. Tomoyo smiled warmly when thinking back 
at that day. She knew that she had a liking for girls but on that 
particullar day it became even more apparent. Sakura was the kind of 
girl who gets better looking as she matures and even at ten she was of 
an astonishing beauty. Tomoyo had found the soul mate she had been 
searching for, or at least that&#146;s what she innitially thought.

Sakura had it all, looks, brains, magical abilities and a lovable 
persona but one thing she didn&#146;t have was a liking towards girls. 
Tomoyo found out very early that she had no chance of making Sakura 
her lover, Sakura would love to tell stories about Yukito and how 
handsome he was. And then came Xiao-lan Li, the boy from China who 
never granted Sakura anything but there was something in his way of 
doing in which Tomoyo recognized herself. Although their methods were 
different, they were both out for Sakura&#146;s love. 

Xiao-lan turned out to be a nice person after all, who just never had 
the opportunity to express himself the way he wanted. Tomoyo knew 
exactly where he was coming from. She could express herself by 
tailoring Sakura&#146;s clothes and video taping all her actions. Xiao-lan 
never had such an outlet and thus came across blunt and unfriendly. 
Towards Sakura his normal way of doing would be degrading putting her 
value as a cradcaptor in doubt but even then, there was something in 
his eyes, something very lonely.

Tomoyo put in one of her many videotapes and watched. Here were Sakura 
and Xiao-lan, almost a year after he came over from Hong Kong, 
fighting side by side. As Xiao-lan&#146;s face came into view she stopped 
the tape. His eyes looked full of life, the emptiness of when he first 
came around was gone. Xiao-lan and Sakura eventually started dating.

As Tomoyo laid out a spread of pictures of Sakura from her tenth to 
her twenty-fith she flushed. Sakura became a very beautiful woman, her 
atlethic figure and childish face combinding both things that Tomoyo 
would like to have in a lover. At eighteen Tomoyo went to England to 
study, while there she began dating girls, trying to make herself 
familiar with having a lesbian relationship, it struck her that it 
didn&#146;t feel awkward.  It once again proved that being a lesbian was no 
deliberate choice it was something that had been there all along.

But none of the girls she dated during her time in England were out 
for a serious relationship, most of them were in it for the sex of it. 
It pained Tomoyo to see someone she had been with making out with a 
guy the very next day. Although she had learned a lot during her stay, 
she knew that she wouldn&#146;t find her true love in England.

At her return to Japan, many of her old friends were there to throw 
her a welcome party. It was at this party where she heard of the day 
she both feared and longed for to see. Sakura and Xiao-lan announced 
their wedding. Tomoyo was in tears both of happiness for Sakura and of 
sadness that this very last chance of having her as her lover, even if 
it were for just one night, was gone. Tomoyo smiled as she watched the 
tape of the announcement. Sakura was happy, that was important, even 
as a child Tomoyo vowed to make Sakura happy, mission accomplished.

Being Maid of honor was by far the hardest thing Tomoyo remembered 
doing. But as Sakura&#146;s best friend it simply was her duty to be there. 
Tomoyo&#146;s seemingly endless supply of money paid for the bills of a 
very beautiful and very big wedding. Sakura was overjoyed and gave her 
a very big smooch on her cheek, the only time she had the honor of 
feeling just how soft Sakura&#146;s lips were. Rather than taking this as a 
slap in the face of being pressed upon of what she never would have, 
Tomoyo saw it as a blessing, a blessing of being a granted a taste of 
the forbidden fruit and it was offered by Sakura herself no less.

As Tomoyo watched the tape of the wedding she almost laughed out loud 
when seeing Xiao-lan and his best man Takashi awaiting Sakura&#146;s 
arrival at the altar. She couldn&#146;t make out what Takashi was talking 
about but it was no doubt something about where the term &#147;Best man&#148; 
came from or how people in Hawaii would arrange a marriage by filling 
coconut shells with sand and throw them in the ocean seeing which one 
would stay afloat the longest. Takashi and Chiharu were an engaged 
couple but she hadn&#146;t found a way to make him stop making up all that 
non-sense.

Sakura still looked stunning in the wedding dress that Tomoyo had 
tailored for her. Rather than using white satin Tomoyo went for oker 
pink, a very warm color. She tried to make Sakura&#146;s personality to 
come forward and succeeded in doing so. Xiao-lan nearly fainted when 
Sakura and her father came walking up the isle.

The wedding was a bittersweet affair for Tomoyo, she was happy for her 
friend but sad of never being granted a chance but that was to change. 
At the wedding party she met up with a person who probably was the 
very last person she expected to attend the wedding.

Mei-lin Li had been there all along, blending in with the background, 
trying not to attract much attention and looking very out of place. 
Maybe it was just that why Tomoyo walked up to her and greeted her. 
When Mei-lin looked up she revealed an empty smile, her eyes were 
empty. 

Was it mutual kinship, was it the craving for a friend, or maybe a 
clow card? Tomoyo wasn&#146;t sure but there was no denying that something 
made the two of them start a conversation. Both of them walked out 
onto a balcony of the mansion where the wedding took place and Mei-lin 
cleaned out her closet, she had been Xiao-lan&#146;s designated wife, it 
had been arranged in their childhood and he never seemed to even like 
her. Although she made peace with the fact that she would never have 
Xiao-lan, this wedding just slapped it in her face.

Their conversation lasted longer than it should have and they both 
started spending time together after the wedding. Lunch meetings, 
tai-chi classes, shopping sprees all sorts of silly things, they even 
visited each other for no apparent reason. But this was no ordinairy 
friendship, Tomoyo began to notice the signs of something beautiful 
when Mei-lin began to walk closer to her at every time they met. And 
it was at an empty metro station after they missed the last train home 
that it happened.

A Kiss of true love. Tomoyo would never forget it, the kisses she had 
from the girls she dated before were just dust in the wind, this was 
different. Tomoyo and Mei-lin had been brought together by losing the 
ones they set their eyes on. Their mutual kinship had made the magic 
happen.

As Tomoyo closed the closet containing the videos and photographs of 
Sakura, she glanced at the wedding picture, she was the Miad of honor 
at her love interrest&#146; wedding but harbored no regrets about that 
matter. Sakura was happy with Xiao-lan, who was she to make her 
unhappy, she never would admit her crush to Sakura and she had no 
reason to do so either, what you don&#146;t know can&#146;t hurt you.

Mei-lin was peacefully asleep in the master bed, Tomoyo gently stroke 
her long black hair before joining her, tomorrow would be a busy day,  
it was time that she would get some rest too. Before turning off the 
lights Tomoyo took a glance at the wedding dress she would wear 
tomorrow, it was light green, the color of spring. She smiled at the 
thought that just maybe somebody would find their future spouse at her 
wedding in the same way that she found hers.

With that thought in mind Tomoyo turned off the light and drifted away 
in slumber with a smile on her face.</pre>
