fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jmccall.html">Jacklyn McCall</a><br> </h2>
<pre>         The alarm clock on Sakura Kinomoto&#39;s headstand clicked onto 
7:30, then it rang as loud as it possibly could.
         Keero blinked lazily and looked at the clock. He flew over to 
the sleeping Sakura groggily, grumbling to himself.
         &quot;SAKURA!! GET YOUR BUTT UP!&quot; yelled Sakura&#39;s older brother, 
Touya, from downstairs.
         Sakura sat up slowly, slamming her hand down on her alarm 
clock. She looked at the clock, then at her calender. She then freaked 
out.
         &quot;OH MY GOD!! It&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day and I have nothing to give 
Tomoyo!!!&quot; Sakura shrieked, fully waking up Keero.
         &quot;Why not just get her a box of chocolates? No..wait..get 
those for me and get Tomoyo some flowers or something&quot; Keero said, 
practically drooling at the thought of chocolate.
         Sakura growled gently, fustrated &quot;No Keero! It&#39;s got to be 
from girl-to-girl, not guy-to-girl!&quot; She ran over to her desk, tossing 
out everything, trying to look for something.
         &quot;What the heck ya lookin&#39; for, Sakura-san..?&quot; Keero blinked.
         &quot;Ah ha! Found it!&quot; the girl cried, grinning. She held a pink 
and blue box, which was tied with a very pterry white bow.
         Keero hovered above Sakura and blinked as she yanked up her 
backpack and sped downstairs, grabbing the cinnamin toast Touya held.
         &quot;See ya later..squirt..&quot; Touya said monotonely.
         &quot;Shut up, Touya!&quot; Sakura said muffled as she put on her 
roller blades, wrist guards, arm pad, knee pads and helmet. She then 
dashed off to school.
         Tomoyo smiled as Sakura finally sat down at her desk a few 
minutes before the bell rang.
         &quot;Moshi moshi, Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said brightly, smiling 
still.
         &quot;Moshi moshi Tomoy-chan!!&quot; Sakura replied, suddenly perking 
up, smiling, &quot;I&#39;ve got soemthing for you.&quot;
         Tomoyo tilted her head, blinking &quot;What is it?&quot;
         Sakura giggled, pulling out the pink and blue box, and she 
handed it to Tomoyo.
         &quot;Oooh! Arigatou, Sakura-chan!&quot; she gasped, taking the. She 
opened it up slowly and carefully.
         Inside the box was a beautiful pure silver heart locket with 
a sapphire chain.
         &quot;Open up the locket&quot; Sakura encouraged, smiling, her head 
resting on her loose fists under her chin.
         Tomoyo did so, then smiled brightly. It showed Sakura and 
herself at the carnival, both eating the same ice cream cone and 
Sakura had a pink spot on her nose from the strawberry ice cream.
         &quot;Thank you, Sakura-chan. Aishiteru.&quot;
         &quot;Aishiteru, Tomoyo-chan. Happy Valentine&#39;s Day.&quot;</pre>
