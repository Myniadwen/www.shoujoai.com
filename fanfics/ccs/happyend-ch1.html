<h1>Happy Ends are Possible</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shangrila.html">Shangri-La</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes:  I wrote this because I was reading a Sakura/Syaoran 
fic where they were getting married. And I just couldn&#39;t let that 
happen, at least not without my conscience seriously nagging me all 
time. ARGH what a nag it is. Ah well, hope you enjoy it.

------------------------------------------------------------

Today was the day before, the biggest day of Sakura&#39;s life, and Tomoyo 
had been busy preparing it all. Today was the day before Sakura&#39;s 
wedding to Shaolan.

&quot;Sakura-chan here&#39;s your dress.&quot; Tomoyo said as she handed Sakura the 
gorgeous  wedding dress. Sakura walked up to Tomoyo and took the dress 
and held it up to look at it. Sakura gasped when she saw it.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan this is too beautiful. You really shouldn&#39;t spend so much 
time on me,&quot; 

&quot;It was really no trouble, it was a pleasure to make a wedding dress 
for Sakura-chan. Go on and try it on.&quot; Tomoyo spoke as she pointed to 
Sakura&#39;s room. Sakura walked into the room and put the dress on and 
walked out, quite embarassed.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan this...this is really too much!&quot; Sakura blushed, this is 
probably true, of the dress...for the dress has ribbon and lace 
/everywhere/. It was of a very simple design. It was just a 
form-fitting gown that came down to just above the floor, the sleeves 
came to the centre of her fore arms with lace hanging loosely down to 
the tips of her hands. There was a slash across the front of the dress 
revealing silver cloth with stars spread across it.

At seeing her friend in the dress Tomoyo was struck speakless. 
&quot;Sa-Sakura i-it&#39;s.....&quot; Tomoyo trailed off lacking words to pronounce 
the beauty that is Sakura.

Sakura taking this as a bad thing, blushes, &quot;Is it really /that/ bad 
Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura stutters out. If anything Tomoyo looks so shocked 
she almost fell over.

&quot;No! Sakura I-I-I just c-couldn&#39;t think of anything to say. You&#39;re 
s-so beautiful that words would just be lacking.&quot; Tomoyo sighed. &#39;Wish 
I had told her. It&#39;s too late now, she&#39;s going to marry Shaolan-kun in 
a day.&#39; Sakura looks at her friend funny.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan are you okay? You look spaced out.&quot; As Sakura spoke 
Tomoyo snaps out of her reverie and realizes she just zoned out.

&quot;Oh my...I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t realize,&quot; Tomoyo glances at her watch, &quot;Oh 
dear, Sakura-chan I must be going, it&#39;s getting so late.&quot; Tomoyo grabs 
her jacket and heads out to the front door, Oyasumi nasai 
Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo called out as she left.

------------------------------------------------------------

&#39;Oh I can&#39;t believe I am going to do this. I am such a coward, and 
after everything that I have done.&#39; Tomoyo is stitting at her desk 
glazing out her window, when she comes to a realization, &#39;I&#39;ll just 
have to write a letter.&#39; With that Tomoyo pulls out some stationary 
and a pen. She quickly begins to compose her letter.

After a while, when Tomoyo finishes, she places her letter in an 
envelope and pulls out a candle and some sealing wax. Once the enough 
wax is melted Tomoyo drips it on the envelope and presses her seal to 
it. Returning her tools to her desk, Tomoyo walks over to her bed and 
looks a the sleeping figure there.

Reaching over and shaking the Seal Beast, who has been staying with 
Tomoyo because he can&#39;t stand &#39;the kid&#39;, has little affect. 
&quot;Kero-chan...Kero-chan wake up, please.&quot; Tomoyo whispers loud enough 
to wake him up.

Cracking open an eye to look at who&#39;s shaking him, Kero sees Tomoyo, 
&quot;whaddya want,&quot; he so bluntly puts it.

&quot;Kero-chan, I have a favor to ask of you.&quot; Kero nods his head. &quot;Could 
you please give this to Sakura-chan before the wedding? I can&#39;t go.&quot;

At this Kero becomes fully awake, &quot;Wha? Why not? You prepared 
everything and you&#39;re not even going to get to see it?&quot;

Tomoyo shakes her head a little sadly, &quot;It&#39;s okay, really. I just 
really need you to deliver this to Sakura-chan before the wedding. 
Will you please do it?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; Kero replies, getting a sly look in his eyes he says, 
&quot;But only if you give me some sweets!&quot;

Tomoyo laughs at this and pokes Kero in the stomach, &quot;Kero-chan if you 
keep getting me to make you sweets you&#39;re going to become fat, and 
then you won&#39;t be able to fly anymore,&quot; at this Kero pouts and makes 
gumbling noise. This just makes Tomoyo laugh some more, &quot;Alright 
Kero-chan, you win, I&#39;ll make you something. I&#39;ll have something ready 
for you after you deliver it, it&#39;ll be on my desk, ok?&quot; Kero nods and 
takes the letter from her, &quot;Now Kero-chan I&#39;m relying on you to give 
this to her. So please get it to her on time.&quot;

&quot;Ya ya sure whatever. I&#39;ll get it to her on time, just lemme get some 
sleep,k?&quot;

&quot;Oyasumi nasai, Kero-chan. Arigatou.&quot; Tomoyo said as she shut out the 
light and went to bed also.

------------------------------------------------------------

{Dressing room at the Church}

Sakura is pacing around the room waiting for Tomoyo to show up. Her 
bridemaids were all there. There&#39;s dresses were made by Tomoyo too, 
yet less extravegant so as not to out shine Sakura.(Although in 
Tomoyo&#39;s humble opinion that could never happen.) Sakura looked up at 
the window when she heard scratching noises. It was Kero. Looking at 
her friends to see if they are looking, which they convineantly 
weren&#39;t, Sakura gestures towards the bathroom.

Walking into the bathroom Sakura open the window to let Kero in. As 
soon as he is in she pounces on him (not literally) and asks him where 
Tomoyo is. To this, and to great affect, he pulls out the envelope. 
&quot;Tomoyo told me to give this to you. She also wanted me to tell you 
she couldn&#39;t come.&quot;

Sakura grabbed the letter from Kero. On the front was her name written 
beautifully, on the back was Tomoyo&#39;s seal. A creseant moon with stars 
all around. At this Sakura smiles knowing that it really is from her 
friend. She breaks the seal and pulls out the pages. The first is 
basically just wishing Sakura well for her wedding. The other was more 
important.

&#39;Dear Sakura-chan,

       Please forgive me, for I am not able to attend your wedding. I 
cannot for my own selfish reasons, which will be explained in this 
letter. 

Sakura-chan I am but a great coward, you see. I&#39;ve loved you for a 
/really/ long time. Although it hasn&#39;t been until recently that I&#39;ve 
really noticed exactly how long.

I remember telling you once when we were children, you said you loved 
me too. Yet I know you meant it differenetly then I did, and so I told 
you that I would tell you when we are older. I have been putting it 
off out of fear of what you might do. No, I do not fear you to attack 
me, but for you to shun me, or even worse to hate me.

I kept wanted to tell you, but you were so happy with Shaolan I didn&#39;t 
want to ruin your happiness. All I&#39;ve ever wanted was your happiness. 
So please be happy, no matter what your feelings are on what I&#39;m about 
to tell you.

Aishiteru, Sakura-chan. I love you, I am in love with you, and have 
been for the longest of times. I hope you can forgive me. I hope will 
can still be friends. I also hope you can forgive for being such a 
coward for not being able to tell you this in person.

Be happy, you&#39;re getting married to the one you love. 

Good bye, Sakura-chan

Love always,

Daidouji Tomoyo

P.S. Tell Kero-chan for me that his cake is on my desk. For I won&#39;t be 
home when he returns.&#39;

After reading the letter, Sakura just sat in silence staring at the 
letter. She stayed like that until she heard Naoko&#39;s voice telling her 
it was time for the ceremony.

Sakura blinked out of her daze and yells,&quot;HAI!&quot; before turning to Kero 
and saying, &quot;Kero-chan Tomoyo says that your cake is on her desk for 
when you get back. She also says she isn&#39;t going to be home when you 
get back.&quot; Kero tries to ask what was in the letter but Sakura had 
folded it out and put it in her dress and had already left the room.

&quot;Are you okay, Sakura-chan? You were in there for a long time,&quot; 
Chiharou asks Sakura. Sakura just turns her blank gaze at her and 
nods. Chiharou becomes confused at Sakura&#39;s look and says, &quot;Tomoyo 
hasn&#39;t shown up either.&quot;

That snapped Sakura out of state, she looks a her friends and 
says,&quot;Hai, I know she can&#39;t come, something important came up(ya I 
know that was a lame thing to say) and she told me she couldn&#39;t make 
it.&quot; The three girls look at Sakura in concern but she just starts to 
walk towards the door. At the door she turns to them and says,&quot;Let&#39;s 
get this started.&quot;

{At the Alter}

The priest is mumbling out the usual schpeel. Sakura is anxiously 
looking at the rows of people gathered there. Everyone is there, 
Yukito, Touya, her father, Meiling, all of the Li family, but the one 
person she needed there wasn&#39;t.

Sakura gets rather nervous when she suddenly notices that /everyone/ 
is looking at /her/. She turns back to the priest with a confused look 
on her face and utters, &quot;Hoe?&quot; The priest repeats the vows asking her 
to say yes or no. Sakura feels trapped as she looks at Shaolan, he 
looks so eager for her reply. Sakura then looks out into the people 
gathered.

Looking back to Shaolan she prepares herself mentally for what she is 
about to say. It must have shown on her face because the look on 
Shaolan&#39;s face changed. Glancing down at her feet, Sakura speaks, 
&quot;Li-san,&quot; that alone looked like it was a slap in the face to Shaolan, 
&quot;I-I ...please forgive me...but I cannot marry you. I&#39;m really sorry. 
There&#39;s no way for me to express my sorrow at causing you this grief. 
I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Sakura then places her mouth close to his ear and whispers 
very quietly, &quot;Li-kun, please don&#39;t think this was your fault. Please 
marry Meiling and love her as much a possible. Or if not her then 
someone else, but please be happy. This is good-bye Li-kun. Good-bye 
and please be happy.&quot;

With that Sakura ran from the chruch before any one could stop her. 
Pulling out her Key she called upon her Cards.

------------------------------------------------------------

{King Penguin Park}

Tomoyo is slowly swinging back and forth on a swing(where else is 
there to go?) idely thinking of Sakura. She wondered if Sakura had 
married Shaolan yet. Wondering if Sakura will still be her friend. 
Wondering if Kero liked his cake. Well not really wondering about the 
last one, as long as it has sugar in it Kero will love it. Wondering 
what life will be like without Sakura. But most of all Tomoyo just 
thought about how beautiful Sakura is.

Thinking on her beauty made Tomoyo think of more costumes and outfits 
she could make for Sakura, but they would never get to be worn and so 
she tried to erase them from her mind. She tried to get Sakura off her 
mind and think of something else, and she had almost succeeded. That 
is until she started to halucinate and see Sakura in her wedding dress 
flying through the sky towards her with angelic wings upon her back. 

That&#39;s about when Sakura noticed Tomoyo on the swing and landed. This 
caused Tomoyo to gape because she was also hearing things, she heard 
feet landing.

Sakura ran to Tomoyo&#39;s side and pulled the letter out from where she 
had put it after reading it in the bathroom. She waved it in front of 
Tomoyo&#39;s face frantically, &quot;Tomoyo is what you said in this true?&quot; 
Tomoyo just closed her mouth and continued to stare at Sakura like she 
was an angel from above.(Of course, Tomoyo already thought this.)

Touching her friend&#39;s shoulder repeats her question. This time Tomoyo 
looks down at  Sakura&#39;s hand on her shoulder, then she looks back up 
at Sakura and asks her, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you at your wedding?&quot;

Sakura looks at her friend as if she is daft,(which she is a this 
point in time but that is of no fault of her own) and says,&quot;I&#39;m not at 
my wedding because I told Li-kun that I cannot marry him. Is what you 
put in this letter true?&quot;

Tomoyo looks at Sakura once again and at a loss of words,because she 
finally realized this was real, nods her head. At this Sakura 
brightens visably, and throws herself at her friend, nearly knocked 
her from her seat on the swing. Sakura cries out, &quot;AISHITERU 
TOMOYO-CHAN! I love you too!&quot; At which point she pulls Tomoyo into a 
passionate, soul shattering kiss. Tomoyo was too stunned at first to 
do anything, but she quickly returned the kiss with all her tender 
burnin&#39; love. This continued on until the both were seriously lacking 
in oxygen.

Once she caught her breath, Tomoyo looks at Sakura and asks,&quot;But I 
thought you loved Shaolan-kun? Why are you here?&quot;

Relinquishing her hold on Tomoyo, Sakura moves onto the swing beside 
Tomoyo and explains, &quot;Oh Tomoyo, I&#39;ve only been going out with Li-kun 
because you kept pushing me together with him, and everyone else kept 
trying to do it to him and me, too. I thought I was destined to be 
with him from the way everyone was putting us together. I&#39;ve never 
been given the chance to think on my own feelings. When I read your 
letter I just thought about what it would be like, living without you 
for the rest of my life, or living with him for the rest of my life. 
After that the choice was simple. Please forgive me for being so 
ignorant?&quot;

Beaming at Sakura, Tomoyo replies, &quot;Sakura-chan how could I /not/ 
forgive you? I love you. Always and forever. I&#39;m sorry though for 
pushing you to be with Li-kun. I just wanted you to be happy, and I 
thought he could do it.&quot; Tomoyo looks at her shoes.

At this Sakura looks at her love, places her finger under Tomoyo&#39;s 
chin to raise for her to look at her. Sakura doesn&#39;t say anything, she 
just pulls Tomoyo into a kiss, hoping that it answers her questions. 
Pulling apart, Tomoyo takes Sakura&#39;s hand and pulls them up.

&quot;Saku-chan, let&#39;s go home.&quot;

Sakura looks at their clasped hands and smiles. She then looks back up 
to Tomoyo&#39;s face and smiles, &quot;With you, I&#39;d go anywhere, Tomo-chan.&quot; 
And they walked off into the horizon.

------------------------------------------------------------

Author&#39;s Notes: Eh heh....heh....heh....ya I know dumb ending. That 
ain&#39;t exactly my fault. Ah hell who and I kidding, it was my fault I 
couldn&#39;t think of anything thing better. Yeah I know this story is 
less then probable. How many people do you know who are going to just 
leave their wedding because they got a letter from their best friend 
saying that they are in love with them. Hn. Oh well. Hoped you liked 
it. Oh for anyone who cares, Shaolan ends up with Naoko, Meiling with 
Rika(she&#39;d dumped Terada), and *beams* Kero ends up with a belly ache 
because he ate the ENTIRE cake that Tomoyo had made.(It was 
hugh.)Sakura was last seen arguing with Kero over her making a 
companion for him, and Tomoyo was taping it all... ^.^;;
