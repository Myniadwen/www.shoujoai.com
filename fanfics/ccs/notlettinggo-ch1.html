<h1>Not Letting Go</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mwarrior1.html">Moon Warrior 1</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sakura looked around the park; there was the penguin slide. She spotted 
Tiffany and went over.

&quot;You...you sounded...different, are you alright?&quot;

&quot;Sakura... I...I&#39;m leaving.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re...&quot;: Sakura&#39;s  mouth hung open.

&quot;Yes, goodbye.&quot;: Tiffany turned and started walking.

For a minute Sakura stood there, then she ran and grabbed Tiffany&#39;s 
hand. Tiffany turned to face her.

&quot;Sakur-&quot;

&quot;What did I do?&quot; 

&quot;You didn&#39;t do anything.&quot;

&quot;You told me you were happy.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot;

&quot;I...I can&#39;t let you leave.&quot;

Tiffany&#39;s eyes darted back and forth:&quot; Sakura, I...you can&#39;t...I need 
to go.&quot;

&quot;Tiffany.&quot;: Sakura started to cry: &quot;Just tell me what you want.&quot;

&quot;You...it&#39;s not you.&quot;

Sakura hugged her: &quot;Don&#39;t you know...you&#39;re...you&#39;re the reason 
I...you&#39;re the reason I wake up every morning.&quot;: Sakura said this like 
she had just realized it.

&quot;Sakura.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t...I need you.&quot;

&quot;No...you don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Just tell me...what do you want?&quot;

&quot;I want to go.&quot;

&quot;Then...can I come with you?&quot;

&quot;You...no...what about Li?&quot;

&quot;Li? He&#39;d...is this about Li?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s...let me go.&quot;

Sakura let go. And stood there, staring without seeing

&quot;Sakura. I-&quot;

Sakura focused on Tiffany: &quot;I&#39;m going to do something now. I want you 
to tell me if I&#39;ve guessed right. If I haven&#39;t. I want you to promise 
me you&#39;ll forget what I did.&quot;

&quot;Sakura?&quot; 

&quot;Promise me.&quot;: Sakura was staring intently at her. Tiffany felt 
scared... and aroused.

&quot;Alright.&quot;

Sakura walked up to Tiffany quickly. There faces were an inch apart.

&quot;What-&quot;: Tiffany.

Sakura leaned in closer, mouth open.

&quot;...&quot;

Lips touched, at first Tiffany just stood there as Sakura kissed her. 
She felt Sakura&#39;s tongue opening her lips.

Sakura felt arms surround her and then Tiffany&#39;s tongue writhed around 
hers.

The kiss lasted minutes. Finally Sakura pushed Tiffany slightly away.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Was that what you wanted?&quot;

&quot;Sakura?&quot;

&quot;I...tell me.&quot;

Tiffany looked downward.

&quot;Do you want to forget this?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Tell me.&quot;

&quot;Will you hate me if I say yes?&quot;

&quot;I...I could never hate you.&quot;

&quot;Is this what you want?&quot;

&quot;I-&quot;: Sakura snorted amused.

&quot;Sakura!&quot;

&quot;I want what Tiffany wants.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;: Tiffany

&quot;I...oh hell...I love you.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;No, I LOVE YOU.&quot;

&quot;Oh Sakura.&quot;: Tiffany grabbed her in a hug.

&quot;Tiffany.&quot;

&quot;But you really mean-&quot;

&quot;Fine, I want to kiss you again and make you happy, for as long as you 
let me.&quot;

Tiffany answered her with a kiss.

End.

Yeeee. My first short fic. This is just to respond to all those stories 
where Tiffany leaves. I figure maybe Sakura might not be ready to let 
Tiffany go. Not at least without knowing why. May write sequel to this, 
might not</pre>
