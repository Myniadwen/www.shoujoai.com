<h1>Understanding</h1>

fanfiction by <a href="../authors/danachan.html">dana-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There&#39;s a knock at my door and I push my homework away. At last, a
break... &quot;Come in.&quot;

I&#39;m surprised when Sakura comes in. Surprised enough that I&#39;m rooted to
my chair. &quot;Sakura-chan? I didn&#39;t know you would be... I mean, no one
let me know you&#39;re here.&quot;

She doesn&#39;t meet my gaze as she closes the door. When she looks up,
she&#39;s practically biting her lip. &quot;To... Tomoyo...&quot;

I get up, shock gone, to move to her. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; I ask, even
though I&#39;m sure she&#39;s not. Something is wrong, very, very wrong...

She looks up at me, green eyes miserable and damp with unshed tears.
&quot;Sakura...&quot; I act without thought, pulling her into a hug. &quot;What&#39;s
wrong?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s... I...&quot; she clings to me, and whimpers, reminding me of a
kitten. &quot;Syaoran...&quot;

&quot;Li? Did he do...&quot;

She shakes her head, hair tickling my cheek. &quot;He didn&#39;t do anything...
oh... Tomoyo-chan... he&#39;s been so understanding...&quot;

I put her at arm&#39;s length, and wipe at the tears that have started to
trickle down her cheeks, reminding me of a leaky faucet. &quot;Sakura-chan,
then what is it?&quot;

She sniffles, and wipes weakly at her eyes. &quot;Can we sit down?&quot;

I nod, and she plops down onto my bed, wringing her hands nervously. I
sit down as well, near her but not too close. And I just want to hold
her... &quot;All right,&quot; she takes a deep breath, and then laughs. &quot;This has
to look pretty bad... I mean, I&#39;m crying... I...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; I reply with a smile, handing her a tissue from my
bedside table, &quot;just take your time and...&quot;

Sakura smiles, &quot;You&#39;re amazing, Tomoyo.&quot;

I can&#39;t help but blush. &quot;No, I&#39;m not, Sakura-chan. I&#39;m just doing what
any friend would do...&quot;

And she&#39;s silent after that, dabbing at her cheeks. &quot;I... it&#39;s just...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; I urge softly.

Sakura smiles again, and then closes her eyes. &quot;I know I wasn&#39;t in love
with him from the start. I mean, really, we were rivals -- on different
sides, I know... but things changed... slowly, but surely... He was
stable, at least... I mean, personality wise. And then I knew I loved
him and he loved me and... and... and he had to go...&quot;

I don&#39;t urge her this time, I just let her speak.

&quot;But he came back, Tomoyo. And... then... I... I thought he and I...
would... live happily ever after. You know... a little house with a
garden and children and... and... I liked my dream... but...&quot; She blows
her nose and I offer her another tissue. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

She sniffles more. &quot;But... I...&quot; And she takes a deep breath, here, and
blinks twice. &quot;I&#39;m not in love with him.&quot;

I couldn&#39;t have just heard that. &quot;What?&quot; I sounded rather weak in that,
I notice...

&quot;I&#39;m not... he... he&#39;s a great friend... and I don&#39;t ever want to lose
him... but... he&#39;s the one who pointed it out. When he kissed me...
it... just... wasn&#39;t right.&quot; She wrings her hands more.

&quot;Sakura-chan...&quot;

&quot;I... was terrified... he&#39;d hate me... but he... just thinks I
should... oh Tomoyo...&quot; she breaks down again, and I pull her into a
hug.

&quot;Sakura-chan, Sakura-chan, it&#39;s all right... just cry... you&#39;re allowed
to cry...&quot;

She clings onto me again, whispering things I can&#39;t make out over her
tears. I just want to take her pain away... and it seems so real... so
*there*... I just want you to be happy, Sakura... so cry on my
shoulder, if that&#39;s what you need...

&quot;You&#39;re always here for me... Tomoyo... oh... you...&quot; she sniffles and
I hold onto her.

&quot;I&#39;m just doing what any friend would do...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she replies, and I feel her bold lips on my cheeks. &quot;I&#39;ve ignored
you for so long, Tomoyo... what you really felt...&quot;

I&#39;m shocked, to say the least. &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t deny it... I know you love me...&quot;

I feel weak, and small. &quot;Of course I love you, Sakura-chan... I always
have...&quot;

She kisses my cheek, and I look up to her. Wet cheeks, but a smile on
her lips. &quot;I love you too, you know. You&#39;ve always been there... and I
never want to let go.&quot;

And she falls into my arms, and we fall back onto the bed... this is
what she meant, by his understanding... he sent her willingly to me...
knowing...

&quot;Sakura-chan...&quot;

She&#39;s warm resting atop me, and I wind my arms around her. &quot;I love
you.&quot;

&quot;You too, Tomoyo-chan...&quot;

And her lips on mine light the world on fire.
