<h1>I'll Have to Tell You I Love You in a Song</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Wow, who&#39;d have thought my first ever CCS fic would be a songfic? :P
But that&#39;s what it is. In honor of Valentine&#39;s Day, I decided to make
my writing debut with a short, sweet little songfic. It&#39;s a
Sakura/Tomoyo story *ducks flames from Sakura/Syaoran fans*, and it&#39;s
mostly from Tomoyo&#39;s point of view. Well, the song is at least, until
the last few lines. After that, it switches to Sakura&#39;s. Parts from
Tomoyo&#39;s point of view are encased in {}&#39;s.

I used the song &quot;I&#39;ll have to say I love you in a song&quot;, by Jim Croce.
Sorry if it&#39;s such an obscure one. ^^; I just thought it fit rather
well.

All lyrics are encased in *&#39;s.

I&#39;ve never really seen CCS before, and only know a little about the
manga. So I&#39;m not sure of the time period the storyline covers. In this
story, Sakura and Tomoyo are 13, but Syaoran and Sakura are
(supposedly) falling for one another. So if I got any timeline or story
elements wrong, please let me know.

Anyways, I think that&#39;s enough for the author&#39;s notes, ne? :P Now, on
with the story! ^_^

****

*Well, I know it&#39;s kind of late,
I hope I didn&#39;t wake you.*

{I hate to call this late. I know you&#39;re probably asleep and would hate
to disturb you or anyone else in the house. So if I did, gomen nasai.}

*But what I got to say can&#39;t wait,
I know you&#39;d understand.*

{I just really needed to tell you this. It&#39;s been driving me crazy for
the longest time and if I put it off any longer, it&#39;s sure to kill me.
But you&#39;ll probably understand. You&#39;ve always been so sweet...among
many other things.}

*Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong.*

{I&#39;ve tried to say this to you several times, but no matter how hard I
tried, the words always got caught in my throat. And when I did manage
to say something, it always came out wrong, like &quot;I love that color on
you&quot;, or &quot;You&#39;re very important to me&quot;. Even if those things are
true...they&#39;re not what I wanted to say.}

*So I&#39;ll have to say I love you in a song.*

{What I&#39;m trying to say, and what I&#39;ve been trying to say for all this
time is...I love you, Sakura-chan. I always have, and I always will.}

*Yeah, I know it&#39;s kind of strange,
But every time I&#39;m near you,
I just run out of things to say.*

{It&#39;s so strange. I&#39;m usually so cheerful and talkative around people,
and you&#39;ve always been the shy one. Yet every time we&#39;re together, this
shy, awkward feeling comes over me and I get so...tongue-tied. I don&#39;t
know what to say...}

*I know you&#39;d understand.*

{So you&#39;ll probably understand what I&#39;m saying...or at least I hope.}

*Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong.
So I&#39;ll have to say I love you in a song.*

{People always say that it&#39;s better to confess something like this in
person. But since I obviously can&#39;t do that, I&#39;ve got to tell you over
the phone. In this message. I just hope nobody else hears this before
you do, Sakura.}

*(Guitar solo)*

{I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s come down to this, though...having to tell you my
true feelings in an answering machine message. Were the little messages
I&#39;ve been sending for awhile not getting through? If that&#39;s the
case...I&#39;m not surprised. I love you more than life itself, and I hate
to say anything negative about you...but you can be so dense sometimes,
Sakura-chan. I know you&#39;ve got other important things to worry about,
but still...*sigh* Maybe it&#39;s my fault...maybe I&#39;m being too subtle.

And the sad thing is...even if you had been able to pick up on the
hints, I know you couldn&#39;t feel the same way towards me as I feel
towards you. I know you already have someone...I know you&#39;re slowly
falling in love with Syaoran. But that is okay. I want you to be happy
above all else, and if he makes you happy, then I hope you 2 get
together. I want only the best for you, Sakura-chan. You deserve it.}

*Every time the time was right,
All the words just came out wrong.*

{*sigh* Even when the moment was just perfect, I always managed to
freeze...or he came by...sometimes I feel so frustrated. Why does
something that should be as simple as this have to be so hard to say?
Why?}

*So I&#39;ll have to say I love you in a song.*

{As long as you get this message, I&#39;ll be satisfied. I just hope...you
don&#39;t feel any differently towards me...}

*Yeah, I know it&#39;s kind of late,
I hope I didn&#39;t wake you.*

{Again, if I woke you or your family, gomen nasai. I&#39;ll go
now...Goodnight, Sakura-chan. Sleep well. *voice breaks a little* I
love you. *hangs up*}

*But there&#39;s something that I just got to say.
I know you&#39;d understand.*

I sneak downstairs to the answering machine. I could&#39;ve sworn Tomoyo
just left me a message...but why? Could I just be imagining things? I
walk to the table where the machine rests, and the light is flashing.
Someone did leave a message. I press the &quot;Play&quot; button and listen.

*Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong.
So I&#39;ll have to say I love you in a song.*

By the time the message is over, I can&#39;t even blink. Did I actually
hear this? Tomoyo loves me? I must be dreaming...I pinch myself just to
be sure...this seems so unreal.

&quot;Ow!&quot; I wince. I&#39;m not dreaming. And now I feel guilty, rather stupid,
and relieved. She does love me...

I can&#39;t say that I was wishing the exact same thing the whole time.
Until recently, I only thought of her as my best friend. But lately,
I&#39;d been noticing her in a different light...for the first time, I&#39;m
seeing just how wonderful she really is...how beautiful she looks,
especially in the moonlight on a clear, starry night. And just how much
she means to me. But I&#39;ve also had feelings for Syaoran, so I was
confused.

&#39;Not anymore,&#39; I think. Quietly, I go back up to my room. I slip on my
shoes and jacket, then open the window and climb out. For a minute I
consider using the power of the Clow cards and flying to her house, but
decide not to. It&#39;d be too risky. Shivering, I quickly walk to Tomoyo&#39;s
house.

Standing outside, I gaze into her window. It&#39;s dark, and the blinds are
drawn almost all the way. She&#39;s probably asleep...I consider going back
and just leaving her a message. &#39;No,&#39; I tell myself. &#39;You owe it to
both her and yourself to tell her in person.&#39; I sigh, then pick up a
tiny pebble and throw it up at her window, hoping not to wake her
mother or her bodyguards. As I see her get out of bed and walk to the
window, I feel my heart pounding in my chest. &#39;Please understand,
Tomoyo-chan,&#39; I pray.

&quot;Sakura-chan?&quot; she yawns, rubbing her eyes and looking very surprised
to see me. &quot;Hi...can I talk to you?&quot; I ask shyly. She nods, tossing a
rope out the window. I climb up as fast as I can, then practically fall
into the room, shivering.

&quot;You must be freezing,&quot; she says sympathetically, and wraps a blanket
around my shoulders. &quot;Thanks,&quot; I whisper. She smiles. &quot;No problem,&quot; she
says, settling down next to me on the bed. The next few minutes are
silent.

&quot;What did you want to talk to me about?&quot; she asks. I take a deep
breath, then look at her. &quot;I got your message.&quot; She blushes, and almost
looks panicked.

&quot;You did?&quot; she nearly cries out. I nod. &quot;I see...&quot; She looks down.

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;And...now I understand. And I&#39;m very sorry for not seeing it
before...for not picking up on your hints, and for not realizing I felt
the same way.&quot; She blinks.

&quot;You mean...?&quot; I nod. My heart beats faster, and I can barely get the
words out. But somehow, I manage.

&quot;Aishiteru, Tomoyo-chan,&quot; I whispered. For a minute, she doesn&#39;t
answer. Then she turns to me, her eyes shiny and that beautiful smile
spreading across her face.

&quot;Sakura-chan...&quot; she whispers. Several tears of joy run down her
cheeks. I reach up and gently brush them away with my fingertips, then
take her in my arms. &quot;I-I just can&#39;t believe this...I never thought you
could feel the same way,&quot; she chokes. I look into her eyes, my own
sparkling with happiness.

&quot;I only wish I&#39;d known my own feelings sooner,&quot; I whisper. She smiles
and snuggles closer.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m just happy I finally told you,&quot; she sighs. &quot;I love you
so much...finding out you feel the same way is just...more than I ever
dreamed possible.&quot; Then she looked a little concerned. &quot;What about
Syaoran?&quot; she asked.

&quot;He&#39;s just a good friend. I thought I loved him, but it was only a
schoolgirl crush,&quot; I told her. We gaze into each other&#39;s eyes. She
wraps her arms around my chest, looking deliriously happy.

&quot;I love you, Sakura-chan,&quot; she whispers.

&quot;And I love you.&quot; I lean my head in slightly, as does she. Our eyes
close, and our lips slowly meet.
