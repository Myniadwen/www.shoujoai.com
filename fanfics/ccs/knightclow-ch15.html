<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 15 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Tomoyo raced through the men and women with the
computer disk, eventually dropping it off at the
features desk with a relieved sigh. &quot;Finished as
promised,&quot; the black haired woman sighed in relief,
watching as the young man loaded up her story on his
computer then nodding in approval as he quickly
skimmed the file.

&quot;Tomoyo!&quot; the voice growled from the chief&#39;s office,
causing everyone in the room to jerk to a sudden stop.
Once they all realized it was the young reporter that
the boss wanted, they resumed their frantic pace of
work.

&quot;Oh hell, what did I do this time?&quot; Tomoyo muttered
before the reporter headed back towards the editor in
chief&#39;s offices. Walking through the open door she
kept her voice as meek as possible and asked, &quot;Yes,
ma&#39;am?&quot;

Kaho Mitsuki looked up at Tomoyo from behind her large
desk, the older brown haired woman studying her
thoughtfully for a moment. &quot;Close the door and sit
down,&quot; she said, just a bit of coldness in her tone of
voice.

Tomoyo sat down in the leather cushioned seat as
requested, covertly studying the other woman as well
and trying her best to guess exactly what was going
on. &#39;Does she know about my working with Sakura?&#39; she
wondered. Part of her wanted to ask aloud, but she
held her tongue, determined to see what Kaho wanted.

A slight smile teased Kaho&#39;s lips, then the older
woman sighed. &quot;I have a problem,&quot; she softly
confessed, &quot;one I hope you can help me with.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Tomoyo made it a question.

Kaho looked at her searchingly for a long moment then
she surprisingly confessed, &quot;It involves your mother.&quot;

Tomoyo kept any trace of her reaction off of her face,
but it was hard. &quot;Is she all right?&quot; she asked,
leaning forward in her chair.

&quot;She&#39;s fine,&quot; Kaho was quick to reassure her. &quot;It&#39;s a
problem of a... more personal nature,&quot; she finally
added.

&quot;You and Sonomi are dating,&quot; Tomoyo suggested with a
faint smile.

&quot;How did you know?&quot; Kaho blurted out in surprise, eyes
flashing.

Tomoyo smiled back at her wryly, &quot;Well, I didn&#39;t know
for sure until just now, but there have been rumors,
ma&#39;am.&quot;

Kaho grumbled something uncharitable under her breath
about gossipy reporters, then she reached up to run a
had through her hair with a sigh. &quot;Sonomi&#39;s birthday
is coming up,&quot; she said, &quot;and she was hoping that
you&#39;d attend.&quot; As Tomoyo opened her mouth to say
something Kaho quickly moved to cut her off, &quot;And yes,
I&#39;m aware of the issues you two seem to have, I&#39;m just
asking you to put them aside for one night.&quot;

Tomoyo looked at her boss&#39; face, feeling a flash of
sympathy for how uncomfortable this whole situation
seemed to make her. &quot;You know it isn&#39;t as easy as
you&#39;re making it sound,&quot; she pointed out as gently as
possible. A frown, &quot;And why didn&#39;t she ask me
herself?&quot;

&quot;Did you check your messages? I suspect there&#39;s a few
requests from your mother to call her back,&quot; Kaho
noted dryly.

Tomoyo winced at that well scored hit. She usually got
a call back request from her mother at least once a
week, and most of them went right into the trash.
&quot;Point made,&quot; she sighed.

&quot;Her birthday only rolls around once a year,&quot; Kaho
reminded her. A faint smile, &quot;If I could I&#39;d order you
to go, but we&#39;ve already got a society reporter
covering the event.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;d make a terrible society reporter,&quot; Tomoyo
grumbled, silently wondering if there was any way she
could make this event bearable. A thought struck her
and she smiled slightly, &quot;Could I bring a date with
me?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see why not,&quot; Kaho said with a broader smile,
glad to see that Tomoyo seemed to be giving in. She
hesitated a moment, studying her then gave in to the
temptation to ask, &quot;What is it between you two?&quot;

&quot;Mother hasn&#39;t told you?&quot; Tomoyo raised an elegant
eyebrow.

&quot;No,&quot; Kaho studied the young woman thoughtfully, &quot;I
think she thought it was inappropriate to tell me her
side, considering we work together.&quot;

&quot;Mother always was honorable,&quot; Tomoyo conceded.

&quot;Well?&quot; Kaho raised an eyebrow, &quot;If I&#39;m going to be
stuck playing referee between you two, I&#39;d at least
like to know why.&quot;

&quot;This&#39;ll stay between us?&quot; Tomoyo asked. When Kaho
nodded she sighed, &quot;You know that my parents divorced
nearly ten years ago?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Kaho acknowledged, &quot;though Sonomi hasn&#39;t told
me much else.&quot;

&quot;Probably because it was embarrassing,&quot; Tomoyo sighed.
&quot;At the time I had noticed that my mother was tending
to slip away on nights that my father was out of
town....&quot;

&quot;I think I can see where this is going,&quot; Kaho winced.

&quot;Sonomi was having an affair with a young lady,&quot;
Tomoyo confirmed. She made a face, &quot;And to make
matters worse I took photos... ones that my father
eventually acquired.&quot;

&quot;Leading to a somewhat messy divorce,&quot; Kaho nodded.

&quot;No, my parents were already on their way there,&quot;
Tomoyo sighed, &quot;but the photos made an already
complicated situation even worse. You see, father was
having an affair, too, and it all came out during the
divorce proceedings.&quot;

&quot;They each probably expected to take the other to the
cleaners with the photos,&quot; Kaho sounded faintly
amused, &quot;it must have came as a shock to discover they
each had the other&#39;s sins documented.&quot;

&quot;Of course Mother found out about my role in Father
getting the information and she was...just a little
upset, shall we say,&quot; Tomoyo kept her face carefully
blank, trying not to remember the hurtful things they
had both said. &quot;We had a fight and before we could
clear the air, I left for university...&quot;

&quot;And you two never patched things up?&quot; Kaho blinked.

Tomoyo shrugged just a bit uncomfortably. &quot;I was
living in the university dorms,&quot; she said quietly,
&quot;and... from what she said she didn&#39;t want me home.&quot;
She shook herself, banishing thoughts of the past as
she asked, &quot;Is there anything else, boss?&quot;

Part of Kaho really wanted to pursue this, but she
also could tell that Tomoyo had quite deliberately cut
her off. &#39;And I got what I wanted, she&#39;s coming,&#39; she
reminded herself. &quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; she said, &quot;we&#39;ll see
you and you guest at seven?&quot;

&quot;See you on Saturday,&quot; Tomoyo agreed, walking out with
a sigh.

&#39;I&#39;m sensing great reluctance,&#39; Kaho thought, closing
her eyes, sitting back and rubbing at her temples.
&quot;And to think,&quot; she muttered, &quot;getting them back
together as family seemed like such a good idea a few
days ago when I talked to Sonomi.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; a familiar voice questioned.

Opening her eyes Kaho saw her secretary looking at her
with some concern.. &quot;Yes, Mei-Lin?&quot; she asked the
perky young woman.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to bother you ma&#39;am,&quot; Mei-Lin said to her
apologetically, &quot;but you were talking to yourself
again.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Kaho sat up, trying to focus her
concentration. &quot;Are the proof sheets ready on the
latest edition?&quot; she asked crisply.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Mei-Lin produced the newspaper sheets and
passed them over. &quot;The webmistress was also asking for
updated biographies of the staff,&quot; she added.

&quot;She can&#39;t just make something up?&quot; Kaho asked as she
scanned the pages for errors as well as noting the
empty spaces reserved for late arriving stories.

Mei-Lin looked amused, &quot;Considering this is Rika we&#39;re
talking about, she&#39;d do a web search and do bios
salted with all our deepest, darkest secrets.&quot;

&quot;She would, too,&quot; Kaho chuckled, thinking of their
enthusiastic head of files. &quot;Any other problems?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;Just the typical stuff,&quot; Mei-Lin shrugged casually,
&quot;fan letters, crank mail, a few threats and some roses
arrived for one of the staff.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Kaho asked curiously.

&quot;Yukito, actually,&quot; Mei-Lin smiled thinking of the
blushing blonde photographer, &quot;from someone called
Toya.&quot;

&quot;Cute,&quot; Kaho chuckled,
