Hikaru looked so peaceful while she slept.

Mirra couldn&#146;t help but smile as she gently brushed a few hairs away 
from her forehead, watching her slumber. How things have changed since 
that first night some months ago.

When Hikaru first fell asleep in Mirra&#146;s bed she wore her day clothes 
and was there to comfort the other girl&#146;s fears as she recovered from 
what Mimic did to her.

Two months ago she started wearing her jammies to bed, feeling more 
and more comfortable with Mirra. She had even started changing in 
front of Mirra for bed. 

A few nights ago they made their first step towards lovemaking (slow, 
baby steps learning as they went) and haven&#146;t looked back since.

------

The night before

Mirra was all smiles as she finished dressing in her jammies. The soft 
material and new clothes smell just excited her. These were brand new 
pajamas from Hikaru, one of the gifts she got from her for Christmas. 
They fit her like a glove, and felt so soft against her bare skin. She 
particularly enjoyed the blue color and little bunny images on the 
fabric. She poked one of the rabbits (situated over her left nipple) 
and gasped, giggling abit at her reaction from her prodding. Quickly 
she jumped into bed, rolling on the soft bedding in her pajamas, 
receiving a charge from the sensations that coursed through her.

&#147;It&#146;s like a slumber party in here everynight, isn&#146;t it?&#148;

Mirra bolted upright, blushing abit as she looked towards the door. 
&#147;Uh--- hi, Umi---&#148;

&#147;Just thought I&#146;d check in on you on the way to bed. You two---&#148;

&#147;----&#148; Mirra blushes.

&#147;Oh-kay, Ok. I won&#145;t ask. I wouldn&#146;t want to make you embarrassed.&#147;

&#147;I&#145;m not embarrassed.&#148;

Umi nods as she exit&#146;s the room, &#147;Sure you&#146;re not.&#147;

&#147;I&#145;m not!&#148; she cries out, feeling the blood drain from her face 
leaving her flushed. She was abit shy, but not because she and Hikaru 
were becoming sexually intimate (slowly, with meek steps). She just 
didn&#146;t want to talk about those things. They were their intimate acts 
that wasn&#146;t Umi&#146;s business.

&#147;----I&#146;m not embarrassed----&#148; Mirra sighs, lying down in her side of 
the bed to relish in the feel of her jammies. &#147;---hmph---&#148; Mirra 
grunts slightly as she rolls over on her stomach and buries her head 
in her pillow. &#147;Umi&#145;s so nosey!&#148; she rasps, her face blushing as she 
thinks about her answer.

She always seems to be prying for &#147;juicy&#148; details of what happens 
between the sheets at night, and it miffs Mirra to no end how Umi 
continues to harp for details of things she didn&#146;t want to talk about. 
Maybe, however, she was embarrassed that she was learning stuff from 
places that she felt ashamed to talk about openly, but she was so 
curious.

She had been &#147;juicing&#148; her age (mimicking an older person) to buy porn 
magazines, mostly of women/women love, and looking through them for 
&#147;ideas&#148; for the past few days. Admittedly she was still rather awkward 
when it came to her sexuality, and didn&#146;t know how Cloud could be so 
mature next to her since they were used about the same amount of times 
(and &#147;Aged&#148; the same way).

As far as everyone was concerned, Cloud seemed to be a mischievous 
little girl to everyone, but Mirra knew how mature she was when she 
wasn&#146;t &#147;playing&#148; around. Still, it gave her a little shock two days 
ago to wander in on &#147;little&#148; Cloud masturbating furiously in her room 
while Kero was out. She didn&#146;t seem at all like the little girl whose 
&#147;body&#148; she wore, but Mirra knew she wasn&#146;t little at all, at least not 
in real age, the body was only her non-powered form--- her true form 
was older in appearance--- and taller.

After Cloud was done, Mirra sat down next to the exhausted &#147;girl&#148; and 
spoke to her, but she didn&#146;t want to talk--- all she did was crawl 
under her blankets of her &#147;bed&#148; set in the corner and hide herself.

She was very prideful, and being caught by Mirra doing that to relieve 
herself only frustrated her and hurt her pride. She refused to come 
out again until Kero returned to play more video games, but by then 
Mirra had already left the pouting Clow &#147;girl&#148; behind to mope under 
her blankets.

For such a young little thing she was actually a mature woman, with 
needs that Mirra was only now beginning to grasp--- needs such as 
sexual fulfillment. However she didn&#146;t like to display this need in 
front others, especially Kero to spare him the pain of having to watch 
without being able to participate.

Make no mistake about it. She did love him, quite strongly, but as 
long as they were unable to achieve their true forms they could do 
little about that love other than keep it close to their hearts and 
mind their time. It might not have happened in the original &#147;world&#148;, 
but a lot of loves and happiness that were now possible didn&#146;t happen 
before so Mirra didn&#146;t gripe about their relationship in the 
slightest.

Absentmindedly she rolls over and reaches under the bed, retrieving 
one magazine to flip through as she waited for Hikaru to come to bed. 
As she flipped through each page she imagined it was her and Hikaru 
making love, and each thought in that direction made her smile. A free 
hand caressed her breast, plucking at her nipple causing it to harden 
as she looked at the pictures. The women in the magazine looked so 
staged, so fake, but Mirra only wanted inspiration so it didn&#146;t matter 
to her as long as they looked like they were in love (so it didn&#146;t 
matter if they were really in love or not).

&#147;Thinking dirty thoughts?&#148;

Mirra suddenly went pale, feeling a weight press onto her rear as 
someone loomed behind her.

&#147;Hik--hikaru---&#148;

Hikaru&#146;s fingers traced the page, rotating around one of the women&#146;s 
breasts, &#147;Do you like big breasts? I know I&#145;m not adequate---&#148;

&#147;NO! No--- I love you---&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s not right!&#148; Hikaru groans in a joking manner, her fingers 
digging into Mirra&#146;s shoulders to massage her. &#147;You have to say your 
lines correctly! You&#146;re supposed to tell me how big my breasts are and 
how you love them!&#148;

&#147;---sorry---&#148;

Hikaru smiles, helping Mirra put her magazine &#147;away&#148; back beneath the 
bed as she looks on. &#147;I&#146;m only joking, Mirra--- I think you&#146;re cute 
when you blush like that. It&#145;s so kawaii!!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not blushing!&#148; Mirra cried out, feeling herself grow even redder.

End of flashback

------

What happened next--- Mirra blushed lightly at the thought.

They were still at an awkward early stage, and content with their 
light and innocent bondings--- after awhile Hikaru helped Mirra slip 
her bottoms off and the two laid down in a 69 position and made love 
in this way (fingers and tongue helping along) until they were 
exhausted and content.

Mirra couldn&#146;t help herself. She couldn&#146;t help but to blush thinking 
how intense and beautiful their little acts of love were some hours 
ago. The thought of each and every lick, stroke, and touch warm in her 
mind and deep within her heart. Unconsciously she wiggled her bottom 
abit, still getting used to sleeping in the half buff (top only). Each 
wiggle sent a little jolt through her, the bedding&#146;s soft material 
exciting her in strange little ways. She had slept for so long in 
jammies that the last few nights of only wearing half her clothes 
(after lovemaking) still wasn&#146;t something she could get used to 
without the need to indulge in these little &#147;jolts&#147; she got from the 
bedding--- at least not yet.

How Tomoyo-mama &amp; Sakura-papa slept in the complete nude in these soft 
squishy blankets and beddings (which tickled her exposed bottom 
everytime she rolled over in bed and threatened to set her off during 
sex) was amazing (to her at least).

Mirra&#146;s eyes narrowed slightly as her stomach grumbled. She was 
feeling a tad hungry.

That was another thing she envied Tomoyo-mama/Sakura-papa, their 
stamina. It seemed as if they could make strong love (a few times 
over), sleep, and wake up at a normal hour to eat breakfast, but Mirra 
felt hungry two hours ago (only a short time after her light 
lovemaking) and that vexed her. She already felt inadequate and it 
would get worst she thought. How could she be hungry after such a low 
key session while mama and papa can love so intensely yet not seem 
hungry afterwards? Did she have that low a stamina?

Abit ashamed, she crawls out of bed (locating her pajama bottoms) and 
sneaks out of the room. She was just going to the kitchen for a snack, 
then back to bed. That&#145;s it. Inside the kitchen, however, she found 
that she wasn&#146;t alone. Inside she found Cloud sitting despondently on 
the floor, looking upwards at the tall cabinets and a treasured box of 
cookies she wanted (but was too short to reach since it was positioned 
so high out of her reach).

Using her power to easily access the box (by becoming an adult sized 
person), she passes the box to Cloud and walks to the refrigerator to 
scrounge up some stuff for breakfast. Admittedly she was still 
learning how to cook, and only mastered a few things like eggs and 
microwave-able meals, so she was only now scrounging for what she knew 
to make. As she sets to cook herself a meal, Cloud stares at her 
(cookie in mouth). &#147;Whatcha&#146; doing?&#148;

&#147;Making something to eat.&#148;

&#147;Munchie! Munchie!&#148; Cloud giggled, stuffing another cookie in her 
mouth ignoring the fact that she was also having a case of the 
&#147;munchies&#148;, though Mirra didn&#146;t miss that fact for a second. &#147;You&#146;re 
eating too.&#148; she pointed out, pointing at the box. &#147;So why are you 
REALLY up?&#148;

&#147;You first, munchie!&#148; Cloud shot back, munching as she talked.

&#147;---I was hungry.&#148; she repeated, but abit reluctantly this time, 
adding, &#147;I wonder if I&#146;m doing right by Hikaru--- being such an 
inadequate lover.&#148;

&#147;Your not that bad. At least you can love her in that way.&#147; Cloud 
muttered as she stood up, mood shifting to her serious self. &#147;I think 
I&#146;m hurting Kero the more I stay in there with him. It&#145;s not fair to 
him.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

No longer eating, Cloud walks over to the table and sits herself down. 
&#147;I woke up and heard him talking in his sleep--- he was remembering 
one of the times we made love when we were--- you know.&#148;

&#147;I know.&#148; Mirra replies, cracking the eggs and dropping it&#146;s contents 
in and seasoning it as it cooked. &#147;Have to cook it longer, hate runny 
yolks.&#148;

&#147;Am I pretty?&#148; Cloud suddenly asks, to which Mirra turns (while 
watching her eggs cook) &#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t feel pretty.&#148; she admits, looking down at herself, &#147;I feel--- 
ugly being this small. I don&#146;t see how people can find this age 
sexy--- it&#146;s disgusting to me. I wish my power was back.&#148;

&#147;Cloud---&#148;

&#147;I want to be the way I should be. Back in my grown up body--- and 
with Kero by my side, as he&#146;s always been--- but I ---&#148; (sighs) &#147;---I 
hate being this little--- it hurts---&#148;

Mirra nods her head, remembering how Hikaru wished to be bigger so she 
could love Mirra better. &#147;I can relate to that sentiment.&#148;

After a few seconds Cloud smiles, her eyes rolling mischievously as 
she bounds over to a cabinet and lifts a six pack of soda bottles from 
a cabinet stocked full of them. &#147;I&#146;m going to stack these in the 
fridge in my/Kero&#146;s room! Never can have too many of these for playing 
games!&#148; And with that she bounces out of the room, back in child mode 
again. &#147;Are you really so unhappy being a child again?&#148; Mirra 
whispers, watching Cloud&#146;s retreating form bound out of the room. As 
she turns her attention back to her food she sighs, was she really 
doing right by Hikaru?

The door opened again.

&#147;Another six pack, Cloud? Sugar rush---&#148; Mirra started, only to come 
to a dead halt vocal-wise.

It was Hikaru, and she looked troubled. &#147;Ah--- what&#146;s wrong, 
Hikaru-chan?&#148;

&#147;I was worried.&#148; she whispered, walking over to Mirra, &#147;You weren&#146;t in 
bed.&#148;

&#147;I got hungry. Here---&#148; (gives a drink to Hikaru) &#147;I&#146;ll make you 
something to eat.&#148;

&#147;Thanks.&#148; she whispered, walking to sit down, shivering abit. &#147;I 
didn&#146;t want to find you in the closet again crying--- it hurts me to 
see you in pain--- it&#145;s not fair--- why can&#145;t Mimic leave us alone?&#148;

Mirra shudders abit, almost losing the egg she was plating as she did. 
It was true, she had been found curled in the closet from time to time 
over the past few months--- but that was because of Mimic. She still 
couldn&#146;t shake the visions--- dreams if it was possible to dream in a 
Realm of Dreams--- and it only scared her what she saw--- but it was 
hurting Hikaru to see Mirra in pain. She knew that now.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry---&#148; she whispered, handing the plate over to Hikaru and 
taking another plate for herself, &#147;I don&#145;t mean to do it on purpose, 
but--- it scares me sometimes---&#148;

&#147;Wake me up.&#148;

&#147;What? I don&#145;t understand.&#148;

&#147;Wake me up.&#148; Hikaru repeats. &#147;I don&#146;t want you to hide yourself 
because you don&#146;t want me to see you cry. Let me at least try to take 
away your pain---&#148;

&#147;Even if I&#146;m crying because of my fears for you? That&#145;s not fair to 
you.&#148;

&#147;Mirra-chan, I&#146;d be a terrible wife to you if I couldn&#146;t comfort the 
one I love.&#148;

Mirra barely sets the plate down before her mind goes numb. 
&#147;---wife---&#148;

Hikaru stands up, walking over to take Mirra&#146;s hand. &#147;I want to spend 
the rest of my life with you if I could--- and if you&#146;d have me I want 
to be your---&#148; (her voice fails her as she kneels before Mirra, 
looking up into her eyes) &#147;Marry me. One day. When you and I are--- 
marry me. Please---&#148; she stops, voice wavering as she lays her head on 
Mirra&#146;s lap.

Mirra stands dumbfounded, uncertain what to say. She knew that she 
always wanted to marry Hikaru one day, like Tomoyo-mama &amp; Sakura-papa 
were planning to get married when they were old enough., and when 
Mirra asked Hikaru once she even said she wanted it. Mirra however 
thought Hikaru was being kind and agreed just to make Mirra happy--- 
until now.

&#147;Here. I have a ring for---&#148; she stammers, lowering her hand to her 
hip and brushing her fingers against her soft naked thigh--- &#147;?&#148;--- 
(she was naked from the waist down) &#147;---&#148; (a smile creeps across her 
face, suddenly she bursts out laughing) &#147;OH GOD I LEFT MY BOTTOMS IN 
THE ROOM!!&#148;

Mirra smiled, &#147;Happens to the best of us.&#148;

&#147;Aww--- and I---&#148;

Two fingers gently press against her lips. &#147;Later. Let&#146;s eat.&#148;

At first she tried to protest, but looking into Mirra&#146;s eyes she knew 
it was futile so she relented, sitting down and eating her snack with 
Mirra, looking anxious to give Mirra her ring.

Mirra smiled, and thought back as she ate, watching Hikaru shifting 
her weight abit from time to time as her shivered abit--- it was a 
little colder sitting on the chairs without her pajama bottoms on.

November 2002

Mirra&#146;s Flashback

&#147;A ring?&#148; Mirra asked, &#147;Uh-huh.&#148; Tomoyo replied as she held the small 
box out to Mirra.

They were in her studio, Tomoyo asked for Mirra to see her. &#147;You&#146;re 
growing up so fast I wanted to make sure I gave this to you before I 
forgot--- so that one day---&#148;

&#147;Not until you and papa marry first!&#148; Mirra screams out, hugging 
Tomoyo as she did, squeezing her tightly, &#147;You have to marry first! I 
want you and Sakura-papa to give me away as my parents! You have to 
get married! You have to! It&#145;s not going to be right unless you&#146;re my 
mommy for real!!&#148;

&#147;Alright! Alright!&#148; Tomoyo relented, smiling as she gave in to the 
&#147;younger&#148; girl&#146;s demands. &#147;I&#146;ll tie the knot first with Sakura-chan, I 
promise! I wouldn&#145;t want to disappoint you with unmarried parents on 
your wedding day!&#148;

&#147;Really?&#148;

&#147;Really.&#148; Tomoyo nods, hugging Mirra back in turn. &#147;If it means that 
much that we give you away on your wedding day as mate and wife then 
I&#145;m sure we can accommodate you, though what if Umi wants to give 
Hikaru away?&#148;

&#147;---uh--- then she&#145;ll have to marry as well?&#147; Mirra smiles sheepishly, 
blushing abit, &#147;Don&#146;t ask me to explain that--- I don&#146;t know what I 
just said.&#148;

&#147;In any case---&#148; Tomoyo motions to the box, &#147;When your ready.&#148;

&#147;When I&#146;m ready. Right.&#148; Mirra nods her head vigorously, &#147;But don&#146;t 
forget your promise!&#148;

&#147;I won&#146;t forget.&#148;

------

The ring was right where she left it. She ran up to the room excited, 
and hid it in her jewelry box.

Mirra retrieved her ring, and knelt on their bed as the two exchanged 
rings and vows.

Vows to marry one day, when the time was right and Tomoyo/Sakura were 
already married.

As Hikaru fell into Mirra&#146;s arms, kissing her, Mirra felt a surge of 
joy and happiness beyond what she felt to date. It felt as if the 
entire room melted away leaving her and Hikaru floating on clouds. Her 
body felt so light from her excitement that she hardly felt the bed as 
she fell backwards, Hikaru in arms, kissing madly and passionately.

She felt so numb it was pure heaven to be so carried away.

It was only when Hikaru switched positions and presented herself to 
Mirra that her senses returned, and she felt her needs rise as she 
placed her hands on her lover&#146;s hips and drew her close for her tongue 
to engulf her womanhood as her&#146;s was enveloped in turn.

The bliss of happiness was replaced by the bliss of their lovemaking, 
and the world just seemed to fall away as Hikaru became her world and 
vice versa.

------

January 31st, 2002 (Morning)

&#147;No fair.&#148; Nina remarked glumly, &#147;We didn&#146;t even get to see all this? 
Nuts!&#148;

Several hours have passed and it was now daylight. As everyone 
gathered in the kitchen for breakfast Mirra and Hikaru were relating 
their decision to become engaged to anyone who&#146;ll listen (which was a 
great deal of people in the house).

&#147;It sounded quite sweet and beautiful.&#148; Eliza noted, smiling at the 
two happy young women, &#147;I&#146;m sure you&#146;ll both be quite happy on your 
wedding day---&#148; (winks at Nina) &#147;---just as we&#146;ll be on our wedding 
day. Right?&#148;

&#147;Right---&#148; Nina nods, blushing at the sudden shift of attention by 
Eliza. &#147;---uh, so, what are we doing today? It being New Year&#146;s Eve 
and all that. We&#145;re going to party, right?&#148;

Fuu entered the room and bowed slightly, &#147;We have visitors this 
morning. A Mrs. &amp; Mrs. Shai&#146;zhan to see Sakura.&#148;

At this Nina scoffs, leaning back in her chair. &#147;Gee, wonder who THAT 
could be.&#148;

&#147;Phwee?&#148;

As Fuu leaves the kitchen Meilin and Xai Shar enter, all smiles. 
Meilin was wearing casual pants and a red dragon t-shirt with cute 
matching red shoes, Xai Shar was wearing her usual uniform (as Keiko &amp; 
Rena often did whether they were working or not). &#147;Meilin? Who---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s their future married last name isn&#146;t it.&#148; Nina noted, looking 
straight at Meilin. &#147;Shai&#146;zhan is a Palominian name--- your changing 
your last name?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a beautiful last name!&#148; Meilin huffed, bowing slightly to Tomoyo 
as she entered, &#147;Good morning, remember my promise?&#148;

&#147;I remember. We&#146;re going to celebrate your wedding engagement today.&#148;

&#147;Hoe??&#148; (Sakura)

&#147;Hoe.&#148; (Nina repeated, scoffingly)

Eliza shifts her weight in her chair to bring her attention to 
Mirra/Eliza, &#147;That&#146;s great! You two can celebrate your engagement 
today too!&#148; Both girls blushed at the sudden attention Meilin &amp; Xai 
Shar gave them as they turned to look at the two. Suddenly Meilin 
smiles and gives Mirra a slight smack on the back as she laughed abit. 
If this was meant to settle down the two&#146;s nerves? It didn&#146;t help one 
bit.

&#147;Let&#146;s go downstairs and set up then.&#148; Nina suddenly announced, taking 
the spotlight off of the two (to their relief). As they walked out of 
the kitchen, Mirra seemed confused. &#147;But we&#146;re already downstairs.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re going down to the holochamber. We can set the celebration up 
down there.&#148;

&#147;Phwee?&#148; Mirra whispered, in trademark Sakura fashion.

------

The holochamber was already on when they entered.

The setting was inside of Tokyo Tower, the observation deck now set up 
for a party with tables of food and a karaoke machine, and there was 
also a huge TV set to one side with ample seating and a few smaller 
sets to another side with video games hooked to them. &#147;I like to be 
prepared just in case.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s been planning this for weeks.&#148; Eliza whispers, cheeks blushing 
as she watches Nina hustle about making sure everything was in it&#146;s 
proper place.

Mirra felt someone grasp her hand, and realized it was Hikaru. She 
seemed a little nervous about the setting, but quickly smiled and 
waved off Mirra&#146;s concerns with a wave of her free hand. Mirra nodded 
her head and went back to looking around. Hikaru was worried, but she 
always tried to shield it when Mirra was around. And she accused her 
of hiding things. Mirra shook her head briefly as she pushed those 
thoughts away for the time being. When she was ready she would say 
what was troubling her, but for now she just wanted to spend the day 
with Hikaru and enjoy herself. That&#146;s it.

&#147;The food&#146;s real by the way, I just used the replicator to set the 
buffet. Help yourselves and I&#146;ll get some of the events started so 
people can relax. Remember it&#146;s a party today so everyone have fun!&#148;

As the groups began to break apart to try some of the food or one of 
the play areas, Hikaru pulled Mirra to one of the tables for a bite to 
eat. Feeling abit famished herself she followed, mouth watering abit 
as she did.

Command Center - Citadel City

The Command Center was bustling with activity, but not for the coming 
New Year&#146;s Eve events.

The screens all around the pit were counting down the hours before the 
portal would be opened wide enough to allow what was on the opposite 
side to enter. It was only a matter of time now.

Admiral Rei Nobringa munched on her food listlessly, occasionally 
glancing back at the huge clocks from time to time waiting for 
something to happen, yet nothing did. For the past several days they 
had been waiting for something to happen--- but as of yet they didn&#146;t 
know what they were waiting for, or how long they had to wait for it 
to happen.

Since the last attempt a few more probes were sent to try and get an 
early look at what waited on the other end, only for each probe to be 
destroyed as it crossed through the rift between dimensions into 
OtherSpace. Because of this they only had scant information on the 
object on the other end, and bits of images and data that they didn&#146;t 
know what to do with--- yet.

With a long sigh, Rei leans back in her chair and looks up at one of 
the huge screens overlooking them from the huge circular wall of the 
pit. &#147;The &#147;suspense&#148; is killing me--- maybe.&#148;

&#147;You won&#146;t feel that way once the shooting starts.&#148;

She doesn&#146;t even bother to turn her head, she only raises one hand and 
waves in the general direction of the voice to her side. &#147;Go be a 
killjoy somewhere else, Jack, I&#146;m not in the mood.&#148;

&#147;You say that as if you were bored with the concept of a gigantic 
alien object coming into far orbit of Terra. I&#146;d have thought you&#146;d be 
as wired as the rest of the staff here, though they did wait to the 
last second to become night owls.&#148;

&#147;Coffee, soda and poppers can keep anyone up for long periods of time, 
but I wouldn&#145;t recommend it as a healthy lifestyle choice if it&#145;s all 
the same to you.&#148; Rei scoffed, pulling the hypospray out of her 
jacket. &#147;This stuff they issued several days ago says your supposed to 
sleep eight hours for every four shots you take of it, so that&#146;s the 
only reason we all waited to the last second before pulling the zombie 
routine. That way we can crash and burn once they order continuos 
rotation shifts once it&#145;s over the threshold into our space.&#147;

&#147;And they won&#146;t issue that order until there&#146;s a viable sign of a real 
threat from this thing even if everything we&#146;ve seen so far indicate 
that it is a threat.&#148; Jack concludes as he sits down, &#147;That&#146;s politics 
for you. Can&#146;t live with it, can&#146;t get rid of it.&#148;

&#147;Figures.&#148; Rei agrees, stifling another yawn as she does. &#147;Yuck.&#148;

&#147;I thought you popped a pill earlier?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s wearing off. And I don&#146;t want to take another yet because I&#146;m 
going off duty in awhile and I&#146;m always back on my feet during sex--- 
technically at least.&#148;

&#147;Uh-huh---&#148; Jack stands up again, &#147;Well I better go before the details 
come out. See you.&#148;

&#147;Mmm---&#148;

The screens seemed to be just as boring now as they were before Jack 
arrived.

The clocks continuing to count down minute by minute, hour by hour.

------

Meanwhile, back in Tokyo---

&#147;So, whose tying the knot first?&#148;

&#147;Phwee?&#148;

&#147;Is there an echo in here? I keep hearing that same noise over and 
over again---&#147; Nina remarks, eventually asking the question on 
everyone&#146;s mind as they sat around the table eating lunch. The group 
consisted of the three marrying couples in question (Sakura/Tomoyo, 
Nina/Eliza and Meilin/Xai Shar).

Meilin was decked out on a couch lying contently in the taller 
Palominians&#146; gentle grip using her breasts as pillows, the two 
plucking crackers &amp; cheese from a tray on the table near to them.

Sakura and Tomoyo sat side by side, and so did Eliza/Nina. As Nina 
finished asking the question, all eyes roamed about as everyone looked 
at each other. Eliza was first to speak. &#147;Nina wanted our wedding to 
be a Christmas thing so we&#146;re having ours on Christmas Eve.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re marrying on May 15th (Xai&#146;s birthday).&#148;

&#147;---hoe---&#148; Sakura face faulted, looking nervous as everyone turned to 
look for her answer. Tomoyo quickly &#147;steps&#148; in and covers her, &#147;We 
haven&#146;t decided yet.&#148;

&#147;Is it going to be this year?&#148; Xai asked, only to receive a warming 
smile (but not answer) from Tomoyo. &#147;We&#146;ll let you know when we 
decided.&#148;

&#147;Whatever.&#148; Nina relented, dropping the subject for the time being. 
&#147;How many more cards does Sakura need to seal anyway?&#148;

Sakura suddenly blanked out, her face going as expressionless as it 
could possibly get.

&#147;What?! You mean you don&#146;t even know??&#148;

&#147;I wasn&#146;t keeping count!&#148; Sakura cried out, defending herself.

&#147;Sigh---&#148; (Nina began counting cards on her fingers) &#147;Let&#146;s see--- 
Jump, Fly, Illusion, Create---&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t forget to minus six cards for those who became human.&#148; Tomoyo 
added, to which Nina scowled, &#147;I know that! I know--- made me lose 
count. 1-2-3-4---&#148;

Silence.

&#147;Anytime today, Einstein.&#148; Keiko called out from another nearby table, 
listening in the whole time. &#147;SHUT IT!&#148; Nina screeches, counting again 
(lost her count again). Finally, which much fanfare she came up with 
the number--- &#147;You captured 13 regular Clow Cards (unlucky).&#148;

&#147;Is that it? Not counting fan cards--- I---&#148; (Sakura bows her head) 
&#147;---it&#146;s 13 cards.&#148;

Keiko, overhearing the conversation from her seat, huffs her breath. 
&#147;13 cards out of a possible 46? That&#146;s only a bit over 25%!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;M SORRY!!&#148; Sakura cries, her shoulders slumping as Tomoyo pulls her 
over to console her.

&#147;Can you do better?&#148; Nina asks, turning around to look at Keiko. &#147;You 
haven&#146;t caught card one.&#148;

&#147;Neither have you so don&#146;t go on about my catching skills! Why I---&#148;

Meanwhile, at one of the game stations (Mario Party 4), Mirra slumps 
her head. &#147;They&#146;re fighting again over there---&#148;

&#147;Ignore them. They&#146;re a bunch of children anyway.&#148; Kero remarks, &#147;They 
simply have no sense of decorum or--- YA-TAH!!&#148; (Kero flies up in the 
air and whoops it up over Cloud&#146;s head as she slumps her shoulders 
now, face scrunched up) &#147;Keep it up, &#147;Kero-chan&#148;--- keep it up!! 
(You&#145;re one to talk about acting like a kid!)&#148;

&#147;You OK?&#148; Hikaru asks, tapping Mirra on the shoulder to draw her 
attention. &#147;I just don&#146;t like it when they fight. I wish they got 
along better.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure they&#146;re getting along just fine, it&#146;s just that---&#148; Hikaru 
stops, sparing the others a quick glance before looking back at Mirra, 
&#147;They just have a funny way of showing it, that&#146;s all.&#148;

&#147;Could&#146;va fooled me.&#148; Kero responded, settling back down to take his 
controller.

Suddenly Mirra became very contemplative as she sat there, thinking--- 
&#147;I hope Fight and Power are in good spirits today---&#148;, a small flicker 
of concern crosses Hikaru&#146;s face, but she quickly suppresses it, 
choosing instead to shift herself so she could lean on Mirra as they 
played. &#145;I hope they&#146;re in good spirits as well.&#146;

------

Fight&#146;s eyes slowly flickered open, her head lolling to one side as 
she stared at the clock.

She&#146;d slept in. A slight frown came across her face as she realized 
that he let her sleep in again so he could make her breakfast. He was 
always doing that. Turning off the alarm clock and letting her sleep 
in when she had a day off. Then again he was a far better cook than 
she was so she enjoyed it when he cooked, and became a nervous wreck 
when she took to the kitchen.

Day off. She never thought being &#147;human&#148; had so much responsibilities. 
As a card she would just shift back to her card form and sleep for 
days (or weeks), but as a human she needed a job (she taught physical 
education at Mirra&#146;s school), and she needed to be constantly 
active--- but, as she fondly remembered, her beloved gave her plenty 
of activities that was &#147;fun&#148; including things that involved bed 
and/or--- as she laid there silently, her fingers gently traced a line 
around her breasts as she thought about what they did during the 
night, and sometimes during the day as well.

Her body seemed to come to life in strange and wonderful ways with 
each and every touch and caress from his hands and body, and she 
cherished every moment together. With the strength to shatter bone and 
metal her body was a weapon, but that weapon just seemed to melt like 
butter in his grip. She never would have thought that someone so 
unassuming could have so much power over her--- but she wanted him to 
be there, and be loved by him. She needed it as much as mistress 
needed love from her special someone, but why didn&#146;t mistress 
understand? &#147;Is this how it is, mistress?&#148; she whispered, her fingers 
lazily tracing circles along her nipples, &#147;Is every night with your 
beloved as beautiful? Does she make you as happy as I am with him? Why 
can&#145;t you understand?&#148;

As Fight rolls over to her side, she frowned at the thought of 
mistress trying to steal her power, and her rash act. She felt guilty 
about hitting mistress for days now, but she didn&#146;t know what else to 
do--- mistress didn&#146;t understand that if it was a better world she 
would have gladly given her powers up.

Each and every night she fears a little. When in the heat of 
lovemaking that she&#146;d lose control, she&#146;d harm him unintentionally--- 
she&#146;d never do it on purpose but--- and then there was her need for 
revenge. If mistress only thought about it, and the situation was 
reversed with her love being the one violated, she would not hesitate 
to do the same and strike back at her tormentors.

&#147;We&#146;re the same.&#148; she whispered to herself, &#147;The same.&#148;

She did not know if she said that because it was true, or just 
comforting words, but she said them all the same. &#147;Did you say 
something?&#148; Fight&#146;s frown vanished quickly, warming back into a smile 
as she rolled back to her lying position and beheld his worried face. 
&#147;Nothing. I was just wondering when breakfast was going to be served.&#148;

He set her place in bed, and patiently waited for her to settle in 
before serving himself. She smiled, and ate her breakfast with 
enthusiasm (his food tasted the best to her because it was made with 
love). 

Briefly her image in the mirror showed and she thought of something 
she hadn&#146;t before. Her hairstyle. When she was in Clow Costume, and in 
her &#147;element&#148; of violence, she wore her hair in such a constricting 
way--- but now her hair was loose and flowed down her back in long 
shimmering waves.

&#145;Maybe I&#146;m more relaxed like this---&#145; she thought to herself, 
&#145;---maybe I&#146;m happier being a lover and a gentle woman than---&#145;, her 
mind focusing back on her meal as she realized he was watching her 
with some concern. She sighed as she tapped her fork for a second 
before devouring another large bite, knowing what was coming next. 
&#147;I&#146;ll never leave you. There&#146;s no need to constantly lavish me.&#148;

&#147;I love doing things for you. It&#145;s not excessive to---&#148;

&#147;Please---&#148; Fight sighed again, looking up at him, &#147;I&#146;m not rejecting 
you. I just don&#146;t want you to feel as if everyday must be a struggle 
to keep my heart--- when you&#146;ve earned it the first moment we met.&#148;

&#147;I felt like such a loser--- couldn&#146;t save you.&#148; he whispered, 
lowering his head. Her strong fingers slide beneath his chin, and 
raise his face up to meet her gaze. &#147;You were there when I felt like 
dying, and protected me from something worst than those men--- myself. 
You&#146;re the strongest man I ever met.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not strong.&#148;

&#147;You came to my rescue even when you knew you were going to lose, and 
what they did to you---&#148; Fight chokes back a bad memory, focusing only 
on him, &#147;---nobody should have had to endure that, but you did--- for 
me.&#148; Without another word she slides closer and holds him tight. &#147;I 
won&#146;t leave you. Ever.&#148;

&#147;Promise?&#148;

&#147;I promise.&#148;

For a second she shuddered, feeling as if it might have been a promise 
she might not be able to keep--- &#145;No.&#146; she thought to herself, &#145;I 
won&#146;t leave his side--- I&#146;d rather die than be sealed again---&#146; And 
with that she leaned forward and kissed him, long and slowly, thinking 
idly if it was the same when mistress kissed her beloved on the lips. 
If two people, regardless of gender, could kiss with the same 
beautiful passion regardless of whether they were man and woman, or 
two women like mistress and--- Tomoyo? That was her name, she finally 
remembered it having heard it only one or twice. Tomoyo.

With that they went back to eating, her mind idly wondering what the 
day would bring.

------

&#147;Yah!!&#148; she cheered, digging into her food with relish. &#147;Thank you, 
mama!&#148;

The tall blonde woman smiled, &#147;I&#146;ve never been called mama before---&#148; 
Quake admitted, her cheeks glowing as she smiled at the word. &#147;I like 
it.&#148;

&#147;Mama!&#148; Power repeated, smiling even wider as Quake took her seat at 
the table. It was a serene moment, even peaceful. They were a happy 
family, even if their occupation wasn&#146;t normally something people 
would associate with happy families--- mainly the occupation of 
assassins. &#147;Papa? Are you---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m feeling better.&#148; Technocrat assured her, motioning towards his 
arm as he ate. &#147;It&#146;s healing up nicely, don&#146;t worry about it!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m going to a friend&#146;s house for New Year&#146;s! Can I---?&#148;

&#147;Sure.&#148; Quake agreed, nodding her head, &#147;There&#146;s no work this week so 
you can stay over tonight. Call us if you need anything, OK?&#148;

&#147;OK!&#148; Power cheerfully replied, going back to eating. From the front 
door of their huge apartment there was a knocking sound. &#147;I&#146;ll get 
it.&#148; Technocrat replied, standing up and heading through from the 
kitchen area into the living room where the knocking was coming from. 
As he opened the door he felt a slight chill go through his body. &#147;Oh, 
it&#146;s you.&#148; he mildly remarked, looking over the man standing outside 
his door. &#147;If this is work then---&#148;

&#147;No, no, not at all---&#148; BloodStorm remarked calmly, looking about a 
bit nervously, &#147;May I enter?&#148;

&#147;I suppose---&#148;

As Technocrat stood aside to let the other assassin enter, he asked 
the obvious. &#147;Work?&#148;

BloodStorm, a tall figure dressed in black (with short black hair and 
coal black eyes to match his clothing) stood for a second before 
responding, &#147;No. At least---&#148;

&#147;What now.&#148; he asked, motioning for BloodStorm to sit down as he 
maintained his position standing, watching over him. &#147;This isn&#146;t 
about---&#148;

&#147;No, no. People like that never cross over from the waking world into 
here. They dream in nightmares even if they believe what they&#146;re 
seeing is pleasant dreams. It&#146;s about the buzz on the rumor mill over 
the past several days.&#148;

&#147;You mean the disturbance out in ElseSpace? I heard about that, but 
what does that have to---&#148;

&#147;It might yield some big work if they start tagging assassination 
groups to take out whoever&#146;s the head of whatever is cooking out 
there. Nice solid work with a nice solid payout? Can&#146;t beat that.&#148;

&#147;Can beat that.&#148; Technocrat shot back flatly, &#147;It&#146;s suicide to take on 
that assignment. Then again you never were the type to concern himself 
with the minor details--- like self preservation.&#148;

&#147;Can&#146;t help it. It&#146;s my narcissistic side acting up. I&#146;m too vain and 
egotistical to know better.&#148;

Silence reigns for a few seconds until Power, backpack on, passes by 
&#147;Bye dad--- daddy?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s nothing.&#147; he assures her, kneeling down to look her in the eyes, 
&#147;Just an old friend. Go on now, your friends are waiting---&#147; (smiles) 
&#147;Go on. Bye sweety.&#148; she moves quickly, kissing him on the cheek and 
dashing out the door. She stops briefly though, one last time, to 
regard BloodStorm before hurrying on her way.

As she closes the door behind her, BloodStorm smiles, his thin lips 
pulling upwards in a way that made Technocrat shiver inwardly. 
&#147;Speaking of narcissistic tendencies, isn&#146;t it abit vain to have a 
Clow Card for a daughter?&#148;

&#147;None of your business.&#148; Technocrat hisses, locking gazes with 
BloodStorm as he stood up again, &#147;I&#146;ll do as I please.&#148; If this was 
meant to surprise BloodStorm, he showed no reaction to it. &#147;Of course. 
As you have always done before, so what&#146;s the surprise in that?&#148; 
BloodStorm remarks as he stands up, brushing himself off and saying 
his farewells, &#147;Not much different than me I suppose. Well, I had to 
ask anyway---&#148; (bows slightly) &#147;See ya&#146; around.&#148;

As the door closes, Technocrat sighs, feeling his partner&#145;s arms wrap 
around him.

&#147;Not if I can help it.&#148;

-----

The morning turned to afternoon, and the day rolled on.

As the celebration rolled on Hikaru felt a slight chill run down her 
spine, but dismissed it.

She felt as if something was going to happen--- but it wasn&#146;t time 
yet.

Not for that yet. Briefly she remembers part of it--- her dreams.

In Tokyo Tower, at night.

She feels Mimic yank her skirt up, forcing her down on all fours. 
Mimic was screaming horribly, her rage beyond anything she&#146;s 
experienced. Mimic was enraged about something, and she knew she was 
blaming Mirra for her pain. Then, on all fours she feels Mimic kick 
her legs open--- and---

&#147;Is something wrong?&#148;

Mirra was standing in front of her, with her usual worried expression 
on her face. Hikaru silently chided herself for letting Mirra see her 
pained expression. She quickly smiled and led Mirra to the table for a 
snack, &#147;I&#146;m OK. Really---&#148;

&#147;I dreamed the same dream you did. I know why you did what you did--- 
why you---&#148; Mirra whispers, to which Hikaru laughed silently. &#147;Did you 
now? Then we must be bonding closer than I---&#148;

&#147;If Mimic rapes you--- I&#146;ll kill her.&#148;

Hikaru falls into silence, stopping dead in her tracks mouth ajar.

&#147;If Mimic rapes you--- I&#146;ll kill her.&#148; she repeated, eyes narrowed and 
tear filled. Without another word Hikaru draws Mirra close and holds 
her tight, &#147;Oh, Mirra-chan.&#148;

The two stand silently embraced, Mirra&#146;s tears falling on the other 
girl&#146;s shoulders as she cried.
