<h1>Voices of Flowers</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjubilee.html">StrawberryJubilee</a><br> </h2>
<pre>She was on her way to meet Sakura at the school cafeteria when she saw 
Syaoran calling on the other girl a few feet away from her. She hid 
herself behind a tree to cover her from their sights. &#39;I know I 
shouldn&#39;t be peeping on other people&#39;s business, but I can&#39;t help 
myself. I have to know what is going on. Moreover, Sakura is my best 
friend, perhaps even more to me. I have to take care of her, right? 
Sure, that must be the reason for my curiosity.&#39;

&quot;Sakura...&quot; The boy blushed as he called her name.

&quot;Syaoran-kun!&quot; Sakura greeted him as cheery as always.

&quot;Do you have a moment? I have something that I need to talk about with 
you.&quot;

Tomoyo had an idea of where this conversation was heading, but she was 
sure Sakura had no clue about it. It was almost Valentine&#39;s Day and the 
perfect time to ask someone out. Sakura may be a great card captor, but 
she is always clueless when it comes to feelings.

&quot;I was on my way to the cafeteria to meet Tomoyo-chan, we can talk 
there,&quot; she said as she took a step towards the cafeteria.

&quot;Sa-Sakura, wait!&quot; He held her arm to stop her. Tomoyo felt a sudden 
twitch in her stomach watching the scene in front of her. &quot;I need to 
talk to you alone...&quot; The boy lowered his head trying to cover his 
blush. He handed her a bouquet of moss roses. The Daidouji family owned 
a flower shop so Tomoyo knows the meanings of flowers. The meaning of a 
moss rose was &#39;confession of love&#39;. The thought of it made Tomoyo feel 
uncomfortable.

&quot;Syaoran-kun?&quot; She looked at him clueless.

&quot;I.. You.. I mean... Would you like to go on a date with me, Sakura?&quot; He 
didn&#39;t dare to look at the girl.

Sakura only stared at him for a moment until she could register what he 
just said.

&quot;Sakura, I like you. Would you go out with me?&quot; He repeated, this time 
more firmly. He managed to hold her hand and look into her eyes as he 
confessed his feelings.

Behind the shade of the tree, Tomoyo unconsciously clenched her hand 
around the fabric of her skirt. &#39;Moss roses... confession of love...&#39; 
She felt like her heart was burning. It hurt her. She was aware that she 
didn&#39;t own Sakura in spite of how close they are. She was aware of the 
fact that one day Sakura will find a lover and leave her. Despite the 
fact that she always reminded herself about that knowing that the time 
has come made her feel awful. A tear slowly ran down her cheek. She bit 
her lower lip to hold the tears back, but it was no use, the tears kept 
trickling down. She saw Sakura answer faintly, but she couldn&#39;t hear 
what she said. She couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. She wiped her tears away 
and ran to the nearest toilet to wash off the traces of her tears. Then, 
slowly she walked towards the cafeteria with a broken heart.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

She was relieved when she reached her room. She could let go of the fake 
smile she was wearing all day. She didn&#39;t want to make Sakura worry, 
especially over her. Sakura is her most precious person, that&#39;s why she 
wants Sakura to be happy no matter what. Her biggest happiness is to see 
Sakura&#39;s happiness.

&quot;That&#39;s right... as long as Sakura is happy, I&#39;m happy too...&quot; She 
smiled faintly. Slowly, the pain in her heart began to fade away. &quot;I 
will do anything as long as she is happy. I want her to be happy, even 
if it isn&#39;t with me.&quot; A vision of Syaoran holding Sakura&#39;s hand appeared 
in her mind. &quot;Yes, I will be happy as long as Sakura is happy,&quot; she said 
firmly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Moshi moshi, this is the Daidouji&#39;s residence. May I help you?&quot;

&quot;Tomoyo-chan, this is Sakura,&quot; a cheerful voice could be heard from the 
other line of the phone.

Hearing the joy in her friend&#39;s tone made her smile. &#39;At least she&#39;s 
happy...&#39; she thought. &quot;Sakura-chan, I&#39;m glad to hear your voice. Is 
there anything I could do, Sakura-chan?&quot; Tomoyo already missed her 
friend even though it was only a few hours since they last met.

&quot;I need your help on something...&quot; Tomoyo could feel the hesitance in 
Sakura&#39;s voice. &quot;but I-I&#39;m not sure I should ask.. I-I...&quot; Sakura 
couldn&#39;t continue her sentence.

&quot;Sakura-chan, if there is anything I could do for you, I would be 
willing to do it.&quot; For a second no reply was heard. &quot;Sakura?&quot;

Tomoyo could hear that the other girl took a deep breath before 
replying. &quot;IamgoingonadateandIneedyourhelpfortheoutfit,&quot; she blurted 
very quickly.

&quot;Pardon me?&quot;

Another deep breath was heard before Sakura&#39;s reply, &quot;I&#39;m going on a 
date on Valentine&#39;s Day and I need you to help me with my outfit...&quot;

It was unusual for Sakura to ask her to design an outfit for her; 
usually it was Tomoyo forcing the other girl to try on her newest 
designs. &#39;Maybe Syaoran really means something to her.&#39; Tomoyo sighed. 
&quot;As long as Sakura is happy, I&#39;m happy too...&quot; Tomoyo remembered what 
she said to herself a few days ago. Then she too took a deep breath 
before answering, &quot;Sure, that would be my pleasure. I will definitely 
design an outfit that would look gorgeous on you.&quot; Tomoyo smiled 
sincerely, even though Sakura couldn&#39;t see it. She was happy that she 
could please Sakura.

&quot;Sankyuu, Tomoyo-chan!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m happy to help, Sakura.&quot;

&quot;Ano, Tomoyo-chan...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Would you accompany me to the cherry blossom park?&quot;

&quot;Well, if that&#39;s what you want I will accompany you until you meet 
Syaoran.&quot;

&quot;Syaoran? Bu-but I haven&#39;t told you with whom I&#39;m going out with.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s obvious, Sakura. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be okay. I better get started 
on making the design then. See you at school, Sakura.&quot;

&quot;Bu-but Tomoyo-&quot; Tomoyo quickly turned off the phone before Sakura 
continued, she couldn&#39;t hold back her tears any longer.

&quot;As long as Sakura is happy, I am happy too... I should be...&quot;she 
sobbed, &quot;but why do I feel this way?&quot; An odd emotion made her chest feel 
heavy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;How do I look?&quot; She was wearing a pink and white colored kimono with 
cherry blossom patterns on it.

&quot;You look beautiful, Sakura-chan...&quot; A faint blush appeared on the 
brunette girl&#39;s face. Tomoyo couldn&#39;t tear her gaze away from the girl 
in front of her. &#39;I wish I was the one in your heart, Sakura-chan...&quot; 
Tomoyo smiled at her friend. &quot;Wait a minute...&quot; Tomoyo tilted Sakura&#39;s 
chin, which made Sakura blush deeper.

&quot;To-tomoyo...&quot;

The dark haired girl smiled. She felt the urge to kiss the angelic girl 
in front of her, but she knew it was best not to act upon her feelings. 
She placed a pink cherry blossom behind Sakura&#39;s ear. &quot;There you look 
perfect now.&quot; Tomoyo smiled again, she was enjoying the closeness 
between them.

Sakura looked down studying her nails. Tomoyo loves to tease Sakura 
because she knows that the brunette girl easily blushes and she thinks 
that Sakura looks very cute that way.

&quot;I wish I could video tape you like I always do, but it&#39;s your first 
date, so I think that won&#39;t be appropriate.&quot; Tomoyo let out a light 
sigh. She was tugging on her camcorder bag.

&quot;You can bring it, Tomoyo-chan. It would be a waste not to film the 
cherry blossoms.&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s eyes widen, she was curious for Sakura&#39;s 
sudden change. Usually, Sakura is too shy to be video taped, Tomoyo was 
the one who influenced her to agree with it.

&quot;Shall we go then?&quot;

&quot;Sure...&quot; Sakura reached for her bag and was about to stand up when 
something caught her eyes. &quot;Tomoyo, whose kimono is that?&quot;

Tomoyo followed Sakura&#39;s gaze and she lowered her head. &quot;Th-that&#39;s 
mine.&quot; Wishing that she were the one dating Sakura instead of Syaoran, 
she made a kimono matching Sakura&#39;s for herself. She knew that her wish 
couldn&#39;t come true, but she hoped that looking at the kimono could 
enlighten her feelings. &quot;I-I...It&#39;s new...&quot; she stammered. &quot;I got the 
idea after making yours.&quot; Somehow, Sakura was amused looking at her 
friend blushing.

&quot;Then you should try it on, Tomoyo-chan! I&#39;m sure it will look great on 
you,&quot; Sakura urged her.

&quot;I don&#39;t think that would be necessary...&quot;

&quot;Come on, Tomoyo-chan... Please...&quot;

Tomoyo couldn&#39;t turn down Sakura&#39;s request. &quot;I&#39;ll try it on if you 
insist...&quot;

&quot;Aww... kawaaaiii... You&#39;re so cute, Tomoyo-chan!&quot; Sakura said loudly in 
a cheerful tone.

&quot;Thanks...&quot; She was very happy to hear it. Abruptly, she turned around 
hoping that Sakura didn&#39;t see the blush creeping on her cheeks. &quot;I guess 
we better get going or you will be late, Sakura-chan.&quot;

Sakura smiled and looked at Tomoyo with an unreadable expression. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry, I won&#39;t be late.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

They sat under the blooming cherry blossom tree, fascinated by its 
beauty. Tomoyo was already filming her beloved friend as they wait for 
Syaoran to come. &quot;What takes him so long? It&#39;s not nice to let a girl 
wait this long.&quot; Not that she minded Syaoran&#39;s lateness, because she 
could have more time with Sakura. Tomoyo was enjoying their time 
together; it was almost like a real date. The two of them together, 
under the beautiful cherry blossom tree, sitting very close to each 
other; Tomoyo was even hoping that Syaoran wouldn&#39;t come at all so she 
can spend the rest of the day with Sakura.

&quot;No, no... that would be so selfish of you, Tomoyo...&quot; She didn&#39;t 
realize that she said it out loud.

&quot;Tomoyo?&quot;

&quot;Ano... nothing...&quot; She continued videotaping Sakura and their 
surroundings.

Sakura began to open her bag and took out two heart shaped bentos and a 
set of tea.

Tomoyo was distracted from her previous activity and kept staring at 
Sakura. &#39;So sweet, she even prepared lunch for him. Such a lucky guy,&#39; 
she sighed deeply.

&quot;Tomoyo?&quot; Sakura realized that her friend was gazing at her. &quot;Is there 
anything wrong? You keep spacing out,&quot; she looked worried.

&quot;No, nothing. I&#39;m fine.&quot; She gave her best to make her smile look 
sincere. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you wait until Syaoran comes?&quot; She was confused why 
Sakura was opening the bentos.

&quot;Sit down, Tomoyo,&quot; Sakura gestured Tomoyo to sit net to her.

Tomoyo nodded and sat down, watching Sakura curiously.

Sakura placed one heart shaped bento in front of Tomoyo and one in front 
of herself. Inside the bento were various types of sushi, Tomoyo&#39;s 
favorite food, decorated in a Valentine &#39;s Day theme. The sushi were 
arranged to shape like a flower. Besides that, Tthe bento was decorated 
with small heart and flowery garnish. &quot;Tomoyo-chan, happy Valentine&#39;s 
Day!&quot; Sakura smiled cheerfully and gave her friend a hug. &quot;Now, let&#39;s 
eat. Ittadakimasu!&quot;

Tomoyo was dazed and it took her a few seconds to register what was 
going on. &quot;I-I don&#39;t understand, Sakura-chan. What about Syaoran-kun?&quot;

&quot;He isn&#39;t coming.&quot;

&quot;Bu-but? How come?&quot;

Sakura chuckled seeing her friend so clueless. Usually she was the 
clueless one, but this time Tomoyo seemed to be completely confused. 
&quot;There was no date with him in the first place.&quot;

&quot;Bu-but I saw him confessing his love to you...&quot;

Sakura&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;You were peeping on me, Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

Tomoyo bowed her head. &quot;Gomen ne... I couldn&#39;t help myself...&quot;

&quot;Did you hear my reply to him?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; She couldn&#39;t bring herself to face Sakura. &quot;I was afraid to hear 
it.&quot; She answered faintly, but Sakura heard it.

Sakura took a deep breath before continuing to talk. &quot;I-I told him I 
liked someone else.&quot; She halted. &quot;I-I just realized that my feelings for 
you are more than friendship. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to ask you out, so 
I planned this...&quot; she paused again, &quot;I-I love you, Tomoyo-chan...&quot; She 
looked Tomoyo in the eye and held her hand. She summoned The Flower card 
and suddenly flower petals were falling around them. &quot;Will you be my 
girlfriend, Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

Tomoyo nodded and smiled. She was so surprised and thrilled that she 
couldn&#39;t form any words.

Sakura held Tomoyo&#39;s chin and leaned forward to kiss her. &quot;I love you, 
Tomoyo-chan.&quot; She wasn&#39;t scared to tell her feelings now that she knows 
Tomoyo feels the same.

&quot;I love you too, Sakura.&quot; She picked up a cherry blossom and gave it to 
Sakura. &quot;Do you know what the meaning of Sakura is?&quot; Sakura shook her 
head. &quot;It means divine beauty. It really suits you.&quot;

Sakura summoned The Flower card again and suddenly petals of magnolias 
were swirling around them. She created a bouquet of magnolias with the 
magic of the card and gave them to Tomoyo. Magnolias were Tomoyo&#39;s 
favorite flowers; Sakura knew the fact since they were friends since the 
third grade. &quot;What is the flower language for magnolias?&quot;

&quot;Ano...&quot; She blushed. &quot;Glorious beauty.&quot;

Sakura caressed her girlfriend&#39;s cheek and smiled. &quot;You are beautiful, 
Tomoyo-chan...&quot; Then she leaned in to kiss Tomoyo again.

Tomoyo was so happy; she couldn&#39;t believe that this was happening. She 
was afraid that it was only a dream and when she wakes up Sakura will be 
gone. She held Sakura&#39;s hand tightly feeling the warmth of it. It isn&#39;t 
a dream, it&#39;s reality and Sakura is there next to her. Not only as her 
best friend anymore, but as her lover too.

&quot;As long as Sakura is happy, I am happy too...&quot; She remembered. &#39;Yes, 
this time I am happy too...&#39;</pre>
