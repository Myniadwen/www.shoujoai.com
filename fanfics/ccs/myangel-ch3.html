------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;There you are, Sakura-chan! I&#146;m glad you&#146;re here! What do you want to 
do first?&#148; I had already planned the entire day out.

&#147;First, I thought we could&#133;wait&#133;Tomoyo&#133;you seem different. Last night 
I didn&#146;t notice it but&#133;you look different.&#148; What was it? Her clothes, 
her face&#133;

&#147;I let my hair grow a little longer, and I don&#146;t wear makeup anymore. 
I don&#146;t know&#133;do I really look that different?&#148; 

&#147;Yes! I like it Tomoyo-chan! You look&#133;&#148; There was no word to describe 
it. Before she was Tomoyo-chan, the little girl, but now&#133;she just 
looked&#133;

&#147;You look more grown up, Tomoyo-chan. Well, the first thing I wanted 
to do today was talk to you about you.&#148; Tomoyo looked surprised.

&#147;About me?&#148; 

&#147;Yes. We always talk about me so much. I just want to find out more 
about you.&#148; For some reason, I could see pain in her eyes just then.

&#147;Well, ok. Let&#146;s go to my room.&#148; After we got there, we only managed 
to talk about her for a few minutes before the subject drifted back to 
me, as it always did. What I didn&#146;t like about Sayoran, what I had 
missed most about Earth&#133;

It was later that it happened. We were going to go out to the mall to 
shop, and I slipped and fell down. I cut my finger on a tiny piece of 
glass.

&#147;Oh, no! Sakura-chan, let me get bandaids!&#148; But when Tomoyo came back, 
she said that she was out of them.

&#147;Let me make it better.&#148; She put her finger in my mouth, and slowly 
sucked the blood off.

I knew it was kind of weird, but somehow, I really enjoyed that 
moment. That was what scared me. I wanted to run away, to go home, but 
at the same time I wanted to cut all of my other fingers so Tomoyo 
would have to do the same to them.

After she was done, she got up. &#147;She&#146;ll so beautiful&#133;&#148; Now my brain 
was scaring me. How could I be thinking of Tomoyo like this? My best 
friend? 
I forced all of my thoughts out of my head and tried to continue the 
day. After we went shopping, we went home and watched a movie. It was 
very late at night by that time.

The movie was&#133;well for one only Tomoyo and I watched it, alone in her 
room. That was all I remember. I was watching her throughout the whole 
thing. At the very end of the movie, the two characters who had been 
best friends finally got together romantically. 

I could see something in Tomoyo&#146;s eyes. &#147;She just feels touched from 
the romantic movie.&#148; But then Tomoyo held my hand. 

We had held hands on many movies before, but this was different. I 
felt&#133;nervous somehow. I had known Tomoyo since I was 8, but somehow&#133;I 
felt nervous inside.

&#147;Are you alright, Sakura-chan?&#148; I nodded my head, and squeezed her 
hand extra hard.

As she squeezed my hand back, I felt something inside me fall into 
place. &#147;This is what romance really is. Feeling the love deep inside. 
Not having to convince yourself it&#146;s there somewhere, like with 
Sayoran.&#148; 

How would Tomoyo feel about this? She never had a boyfriend before. 
And she spent all of her time with her&#133;but she might just be an over 
devoted friend. I knew I had to approach the subject with caution. 

&#147;Tomoyo-chan, have you&#133;have you&#133;&#148;I couldn&#146;t get the words to come out 
of my mouth.

&#147;I mean, you really obsess over me, I mean you tried to kill yourself 
over me, and have you ever thought about&#133;&#148;

Tomoyo was red in the face. &#147;Thought about what, Sakura-chan?&#148; 

&#147;Um, ever thought about what we would be like as&#133;as a couple?&#148; Tomoyo 
was visibly sweating now.

&#147;Sakura-chan, do you&#133;I mean, do you mean like couple&#133;couple?&#148; I 
nodded.

&#147;Well, yes, I have to admit, I have thought about it, but&#133;what are you 
saying, Sakura-chan.&#148;

She doesn&#146;t feel the way I feel. &#147;I&#146;ll go. I&#146;m sorry I brought it up. 
Please forget we ever had this conversation.&#148; As I started to run, 
Tomoyo stopped me.

&#147;Sakura-chan, you&#146;re my best friend. Tell me what you mean.&#148;

&#147;Tomoyo-chan&#133;what did you think when you thought about us as a 
couple?&#148; Tomoyo&#146;s face was beet red.

&#147;I&#133;I don&#146;t know&#133;&#148; Is she embarrassed because she feels the same way or 
is she disgusted? My brain could not figure it out. There was only one 
way to tell now. I leaned forwards and kissed Tomoyo on the lips.

Tomoyo blinked over and over. &#147;Sakura-chan&#133;do you mean it?&#148; I nodded.

Tomoyo leaned forwards and kissed me again. It was so soft and tender. 
&#147;I love you, Sakura-chan. I loved you since I was 8&#133;but I couldn&#146;t 
tell you because I didn&#146;t think you could feel the same way.&#148; I hugged 
her close to me.

&#147;Don&#146;t hide stuff like that from me again Tomoyo-chan.&#148; Then Tomoyo 
really surprised me. She looked me dead in the eyes and spoke four 
magical words.

&#147;Will you marry me?&#148; I was shocked. Happy, but so shocked&#133;

&#147;When we&#146;re older of course. I just had to say it now.&#148; I nodded in 
agreement.

&#147;I would love to marry you when we&#146;re older, Tomoyo-chan&#133;but since we 
have to wait for that&#133;in the meantime&#133;will you be my girlfriend, 
Tomoyo-chan?&#148; She nodded.

&#147;Yes&#133;I&#146;m so happy Sakura-chan. I&#146;m so happy I can love you and you can 
love me back.&#148; We kissed again. It was so soft, so sweet, so 
wonderful. 

&#147;You&#146;re perfect, Tomoyo-chan. I never really understood it, but I&#146;ve 
always known it. You&#146;re perfect.&#148; Tomoyo blushed at the compliment.

&#147;There is no higher praise&#133;than hearing the one you call perfect call 
you perfect.&#148; There was no need for pain anymore. No need for worry.

Everything in life was secondary now. Tomoyo and I had found love. And 
there was no greater feeling than that. Besides the feeling of 
Tomoyo&#146;s kisses&#133;
