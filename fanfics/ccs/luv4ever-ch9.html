<h1>Love Forever (part 9 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>When they arrived, Tomoyo&#39;s bodyguards opened the car door and formed 
two lines between the car and the elevator so the three girls would be 
protected. Everyone got in the elevator and headed for the 4th floor. 
The mall wasn&#39;t open yet, so the only people inside were owners and 
management of the nearly 400 stores. Sonomi and Tomoyo were on the sale 
floor helping their employees make sure everything was ready for when 
the store opened. Sakura meanwhile, was upstairs in Tomoyo&#39;s office 
watching and smiling from the window. Outside, a rather large crowd was 
starting to form at the North entrance of the mall, and Security had a 
tough time trying to keep everyone from rushing the doors. Sonomi asked 
two of the bodyguards to stay at the bottom of the stairs to Tomoyo&#39;s 
office, and two to stay next to the door at the top of the stairs. They 
didn&#39;t want any un-invited guests to barge in on them.

Two of the employees walked over to the door and stood there as they 
waited for Security to open the mall. As soon as the doors were 
unlocked, people rushed in and made a mad dash for Tomoyo&#39;s store. 
Almost half of the 4th floor became crowded with eager shoppers wanting 
to get their share. The two employees looked up to Tomoyo in her office 
and she nodded to tell them to open the doors. There were so many 
people, that not everyone was able to fit inside the store at once. More 
than half had to wait outside until others got what they wanted and 
left. Sakura walked over to the window and was amazed at how busy the 
store was.

&quot;Just think, they all came because they saw my darling Sakura-chan 
modelling!&quot;

Sakura blushed and looked back down to all the people scurrying around 
the floor. One of the women in line at the till looked up and noticed 
Sakura.

&quot;Look! It&#39;s her! It&#39;s Sakura-chan!&quot; She yelled, pointing to the office 
window. Everyone rushed to the bottom of the stairs where the bodyguards 
stopped their advance with some loud whistles and scary looks. The crowd 
grew more boisterious as they started chanting.

&quot;SA-KU-RA! SA-KU-RA! SA-KU-RA!&quot;

Tomoyo opened the door and stepped out to speak.

&quot;I want to thank you all for coming. Sakura, my mother and I are happy 
to know that you are all pleased with our clothes.&quot;

She stepped inside and practically dragged Sakura out to meet her 
adoring fans. She picked up her camera and started filming as Sakura 
struggled to find her words.

&quot;Th... thank you.&quot; She said while blushing. She put her hand behind her 
head and tried speaking again.

&quot;I... I wouldn&#39;t be able to do this without Tomoyo. She&#39;s always given 
me stregnth. I... I...&quot; She flushed and darted back into the office with 
a loud: &quot;Hoeeeeeeeee!&quot;

Everyone blushed at how cute she was and looked to Tomoyo for answers.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. Sakura-chan is very shy. She gets embarassed very easily.&quot; 
She thanked them all for coming and stepped inside to check on Sakura, 
who was sitting on the couch, hugging her knees to her chest.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan! You know I get embarassed easily, why would you do that?!&quot;

&quot;They all came because they saw you Sakura-chan. Without you, this 
wouldn&#39;t have been possible.&quot; She hugged Sakura and gave her a kiss on 
the cheek. 

When they closed up shop, almost everything was gone. Racks were empty, 
Clothes were on the floor, and there were price tags and flyers all over 
the place. Sakura fell asleep on the couch upstairs, so Sonomi carried 
her downstairs and out to the car. Sakura woke up in her bed and noticed 
Tomoyo wasn&#39;t with her. She got up and searched for her. Sakura heard 
the shower running and got a great idea. She snuck into the bathroom and 
stripped off her clothes. She tip-toed up to the shower and peaked 
inside. Tomoyo was turned away from her, so she reached around and 
wrapped her arms around her.

&quot;Sakura-chan!&quot;

Sakura placed her front on Tomoyo&#39;s back and hugged her tightly.

&quot;I love you Tomoyo-chan.&quot;
