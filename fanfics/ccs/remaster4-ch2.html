It was the beginning of school once again.

A few days after New Years&#146;. And even in the more relaxed and easier 
format of the schools of Edenina, the Realm of Dreams, tensions still 
ran high as school resumed. But not from academic pressures, but more 
from the strange moon that had come to rest near their world a few 
days ago.

Still holding it&#146;s position, the Dyson Sphere made no attempts to 
either move, dislodge any forces hostile or friendly, or make any 
outward sign that it even noticed the world it floated near. It simply 
stood it&#146;s ground, surrounded as it was, and waited. But what it was 
waiting for? Nobody knew.

Regardless of that, one thing was clear -- life went on. And it was in 
this mindset that Sakura found herself scrambling to get ready, hands 
flying everywhere and sweat forming on her brow. &#147;I&#146;m late! I&#146;m late! 
I&#146;m late! I&#146;m late!&#148;

&#147;You wouldn&#146;t be late if you practiced the skill of getting up when 
your alarm sounds.&#148; Kero grumbled as he watched Sakura rampage about 
the huge room trying to get ready. &#147;Tomoyo gets up before the alarm, 
why can&#146;t you--&#148;

&#147;THE BED FELT TOO GOOD TO GET UP FROM!!&#148; she screams, hustling to get 
dressed as she did. Sakura Kinomoto, not exactly a morning person by 
anyone standards, yet a good girl nevertheless.

&#147;Any dreams lately?&#148; Kero asked the blur that was Sakura.

&#147;No. Nothing important.&#148; Sakura muttered, dressing, &#147;Just the same 
dream of Tokyo Tower I told you about. Nothing new.&#148;

Kero nearly faints. &#147;That&#146;s not important? Sakura!&#148;

&#147;I got to go!&#148; she yelped, grabbing for her bag, &#147;I&#146;ll talk about it 
with you later!&#148;

The door slams shut leaving him behind. &#147;Sigh. She&#146;ll never learn.&#148;

From the hallway she could year a yelp and a crash, &#147;Uh-boy.&#148;

----

Sakura didn&#146;t get very far. The instant she flew out the door, bag in 
hand, she collided headlong into someone and knocked them down. The 
two of them hit the ground as she felt her breath whipped away from 
the impact. Dazed and confused, she muttered &#147;I&#146;m sorry---&#148; as she 
tried to look at who she hit. That&#146;s when she froze up. Tomoyo looked 
up from beneath her, half her face from her nose on up was peeking out 
from beneath Sakura&#146;s breasts, a slight blush on her cheeks. 
&#147;Breakfast.&#148; she cheerfully (yet slightly muffled) called out.

Sakura couldn&#146;t get off fast enough it seemed, feeling a full on body 
blush, though Tomoyo took it in good stride walking Sakura to the 
kitchen. As she did this she made sure to comment on how Sakura was 
becoming really strong these days, though it only served to make 
Sakura more insecure, &#147;----hoooeeee----&#148; she whined, looking red as a 
lobster from the embarrassment.

They ate a quick breakfast, and was off to school. However there was a 
little disagreement as they headed out the door. At first Sakura tried 
to stop Mirra from going, but she told Sakura simply that she had to 
go, with a reluctant Hikaru in hand. They had both healed from their 
injuries but Hikaru was still flustered by what happened, thus she was 
still endlessly apologizing for everything. She had a long way to go 
to recovery, but as long as Mirra was with her everything would be 
fine.

Sakura made their lunches last night, and Tomoyo packed them away, 
leaving the two girls the task of getting to school. As Tomoyo bladed 
next to Sakura, her pace slightly slower so she could watch Sakura as 
she rolled next to her, she began to worry about her.

Every noise seemed to get Sakura out of bed in a heartbeat. Every 
slight creak or pak or groan got Sakura up, and she want to admit why, 
but Tomoyo knew. Sakura was still recovering from what happened to 
Mirra, still trying to get over the fact that someone she loved could 
be hurt even from a distance (like what Mimic did to Mirra). This 
thought, coupled with the events of the last two days with the strange 
&#147;world&#148; in far orbit, made Sakura very nervous and jumpy. She seemed 
as if she was going to jump out of her skin at any moment. She tried 
to be calm, but her nerves kept getting the better of her.

Tomoyo wanted to do something, but for now all she could do was reach 
out and take Sakura&#146;s hand. She briefly tensed, but relaxed when she 
realized it was only Tomoyo. Hand in hand, a warming blush etched 
across Sakura&#146;s face, the two reached the school and quickly got to 
class. Sakura gently squeezed Tomoyo&#146;s hand with every turn they took, 
partially to insure her partner made the turn, partially to assure 
herself that she was still there. As they locked their gear away and 
put their slippers on she felt Tomoyo slide up behind her, and gently 
kiss the nape of her neck, relishing briefly this beautiful moment. 
Then it was upstairs and straight to class.

Once they got there they could see that half of the class had yet to 
arrive, but some of the more notables was already there. Rena was in a 
far more smarmy mood than she had ever been before, and no wonder, 
because today was her daughter&#146;s first day at school. She stood by her 
talking to her in low whispers as Sakura/Tomoyo came into the room. 
She was going to be sitting next to Rena, and obviously Rena was 
already giving her the &#147;lay of the land&#148; and the who&#146;s who of the 
class.

Keiko was sprawled at her own desk, and for the most part looked 
rather bored. She simply stared up at the ceiling and seemed rather 
out of it. Sakura and Tomoyo exchanged glances, yet Sakura seemed to 
be the only one who was concerned, Tomoyo smiled and gave her an 
assuring nod as if to silently tell her that everything was going to 
be just fine with Keiko. Nina, of course, was probably monitoring from 
the control room she kept on campus. Mr. Terada wasn&#146;t there yet, but 
then again neither was Rika.

&#147;Maybe she&#146;s going to be off today?&#148; Tomoyo suggested, motioning to 
the class. Sure enough, it seemed at least half the class was off 
today, probably still recovering from the shock of the last few days. 
&#147;I hope she&#146;s alright.&#148; Sakura whispered, looking concerned.

&#147;Lots of people took today off.&#148; Keiko noted, drawing the two&#146;s 
attention towards them. &#147;There&#146;s a lot of panic and uncertainty about 
the new &#147;moon&#148; in the sky, so people seem to be taking it rather 
badly. Lots of fears concerning the &#147;end of the world&#148; and so forth. 
It&#146;ll take awhile to calm everyone&#146;s fears but hopefully things will 
be back to normal soon.&#148;

&#147;Hello.&#148; a familiar voice called out, as Meilin walked through the 
door (sword slung to her back and smile on her face). &#147;Oh, why didn&#146;t 
YOU take a day off.&#148; Keiko grumbled. Ignoring the complaints, Meilin 
quickly hangs her sword up in the back of the class and sits down, bag 
hung up in a flash on the hook at the side of her desk, as she looks 
about. &#147;I thought I was late but I guess not.&#148; (looks about confused) 
&#147;Where is everyone?&#148;

&#147;Sick due to impending crisis in the sky.&#148; Keiko muttered, pointing up 
to the ceiling. Suddenly a noise caught her attention as the door 
opened, and in walked Rika &amp; Mr. Terada, hand in hand.

This confused the heck out of Sakura as she watched him sit Rika down, 
and talk to her. As he moved to the front of the class she shot her 
hand in the air and quickly asked &#147;Is Rika alright?&#148; At this question 
Mr. Terada stopped, and looked at her with confusion in his eyes. For 
a few seconds he said nothing, but then he smiled and said &#147;Rika?&#148; 
Rika smiled, and turned her gaze to Sakura in a reassuring manner, 
&#147;I&#146;m fine. Mr. Terada was just comforting me -- my fears about --&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; Sakura whispered, nodding her head. She must have been concerned 
about the &#147;presence&#148; in the sky like everyone else. That made sense to 
her.

However Keiko didn&#146;t seem so satisfied with just that, watched the 
teacher intensely as he walked to the front of the class. His pace 
seemed a little shaky, uncertain but as he finally reached the fron 
the stopped and looked out the door he came through seconds before 
before speaking -- &#147;Before we begin, I have a few announcements. In 
light of the recent events you&#146;ve no doubt noticed that some of your 
classmates aren&#146;t in school today. The fear of what is happening is 
keeping some people at home. It&#146;s small comfort but there&#146;s really 
nothing we can do about it. All we can do is continue with our daily 
lives and -- well -- try to make the best of it. But --&#148; (sighs) &#147;-- 
that&#146;s OK. Forget it.&#148;

An uneasy silence came across the room as he looked up. &#147;Anyway, we 
have a few new stu---&#148;

Something screeched outside and a woman screamed. Everyone quickly 
turned and looked out the window, panic and fear building quickly. 
Keiko tried to push her way through, teeth clenched. &#147;Fifth one 
today.&#148;

&#147;Fifth what?!&#148; Sakura asked, her own heart pounding. Strangely enough 
Mr. Terada didn&#146;t try to stop them, he merely stood in place dazed and 
stunned into silence. &#147;Everyone&#146;s becoming very distracted by the 
object in the sky. It&#146;s causing random accidents and near runovers by 
careless drivers swerving into sidewalks. Nobody&#146;s been killed yet but 
there&#146;s been some injuries.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s Ms. Tanashi!&#148;

Everyone tried to look over the windows, curiosity and fear and 
confusion on their faces as they pressed to look, &#147;She&#146;s on the 
ground! She---&#148;

One of the male students, a bright young man Sakura&#146;s age ran out of 
the classroom. As everyone watched they soon saw Ms. Tanashi slowly 
pull herself to a sitting position, dazed but obviously not hurt while 
a familiar figure laid over her (pushed her out of the way). Meilin 
jumped up and down, screaming &#147;XAI!!&#147; as she did. The Palominian 
woman, at first looking at the car that had missed them by inches, was 
now looking up at the school blushing abit from the attention. &#147;Hi.&#147; 
she mumbled, waving as she felt her normally white fur/skin turn a 
ruby red color. As for Ms. Tanashi? She was shook up from what 
happened, but alright. Seconds later the young man who was sitting 
only three rows ahead of Sakura in class ran out, and into her arms. 
He was quite shaken up but she only smiled, showing him that she was 
fine -- he then kissed her, boldly, holding her tight. As they broke 
free she sat there stunned, then smiled and said something that they 
couldn&#146;t hear, then they kissed again.

Stunned, the entire class went back to their seats. Mr. Terada, who 
managed to catch the end of it, looked at his class and blushed. &#147;It&#146;s 
OK to show that kind of affections.&#148; Keiko suddenly announced, all 
eyes turning towards her. &#147;Because they&#146;re afraid for the future?&#148; 
Tomoyo asked, to which she merely motioned to Mr. Terada (dropping the 
spotlight onto his shoulders). For the longest time he said nothing, 
then as Ms. Tanashi and the young man came into class he glanced at 
her, and received a nod of her head in reply.

&#147;Partially, but also because they&#146;re husband and wife.&#148;

The class was shocked, but the second bombshell silenced even the few 
gasps heard in the room.

&#147;I know, because they were married the same day Rika and I married.&#148;

Rika smiled, then stepped up to him and held him tight as everyone 
looked on.

-----

During the past few days there had been a change of &#147;Guard&#148;.

Two days after the object came into orbit the old principal quit, 
already amongst the first panicked crowds of people running away with 
families to the Central Hub. It was only a small &#147;migration&#148; at this 
point, but fears were that it would only get worst if the situation 
became more grim. But still, Sakura&#146;s school needed a new principal, 
and that day a new principal came in.

She was called in to look into the confusion caused by the confession. 
Now the school had already known of the two marriages, and only asked 
that the teachers show restraint and not express feelings of affection 
to their younger mates in school. But this new principal, who was a 
Winterian female, only frowned at the teachers who spoke to her about 
this and told them to mind their own business.

She then talked to the class and eased their fears before going back 
to work. Her vice principal took offense to her actions, to which she 
replied &#147;You can take as much offense to my ways as you want. But as 
long as I sit in that chair, and call the shots, we&#146;ll do things my 
way here.&#148;, and left it at that.

Her next announcement stunned the school as she lifted the ban on 
teachers showing affections to their younger mates (who might also be 
their students) and allowing free shows of affection. Only a few 
teachers (5), in the end, were in fact married to their students but 
it still sent some ripples throughout the school. Still, Mr. Terada&#146;s 
class was very supportive of both him and Ms. Tanashi (Social Studies) 
and their choices. For the first time the two suddenly found that they 
could sit with their mates in school to eat lunch, and didn&#146;t have to 
hide the fact that they were married anymore, which was a plus.

Once that was done it was time to meet the new students. One Keiko 
knew already --

&#147;Lina Daisuki.&#148;

The young woman who came up looked pretty much exactly the way someone 
would imagine a &#147;daughter&#148; of Rena Daisuki&#146;s to be. She was a tall 
figure of a woman, brash and in your face (like Rena), and yet also a 
truthful and honest person who wore her heart on her sleeve and 
dedicated to completing tasks to a fault.

&#147;Did you brand her your personal property yet?&#148; Keiko whispered, to 
which Rena promptly huffed her breath and ignored. The first person 
was easy enough, and no shocker. The second one---

&#147;We have a returning classmate, you all remember Syaoran Li, right?&#148;

That&#146;s when things stopped making sense.

Everyone (who was there) either looked on in amazement, or in a few 
cases mute anger, as he walked into the room and took his place 
besides the teacher next to Lina. Nothing had changed. He was still 
the same arrogant looking SOB that Keiko, Rena, and even Nina (who was 
no doubt fuming over her post in her Command post) remembered. The 
same eyes, the same look on his face, everything.

They knew one thing, and that was that they didn&#146;t want to see Syaoran 
Li longer than they had to.

A plot was hatched before the three even had a chance to compare 
notes.

Sakura? She was happy to see Li again, but as a friend. As she and 
Tomoyo exchanged glances they both smiled, and knew that there was a 
lot of catching up to do.

As for Meilin? She pouted in her chair and didn&#146;t speak. She knew this 
day was coming, she knew he was going to do this -- she just wished it 
never happened all the same.

-----

As lunchtime rolled around word of the revelations began to spread 
around the schoolyard like wildfire.

Still, for Sakura, the revelation only confused her. &#147;But -- I didn&#146;t 
-- I didn&#146;t see--&#148;

&#147;I thought they got married, I just wasn&#145;t sure.&#148; Tomoyo remarked, 
poking at Sakura&#146;s food as she nibbled on lunch, &#147;It&#146;s very good lunch 
today, Sakura-chan, are you sure---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m eating. I&#146;m just -- confused.&#148; At this Tomoyo smiled, &#147;It&#146;s so 
like my Sakura-chan to sometimes miss the obvious when it stares her 
in the face.&#148;

&#147;Hoe?&#148;

Tomoyo raised one hand and pointed at her ring finger (empty) 
&#147;Remember when Rika came back with that ring? She looked so happy when 
she wore that ring. And not to mention all the times she and Mr. 
Terada were studying together and we wondered why they were doing 
that, remember? There was signs of their feelings for each other for 
sometime, and we missed a lot of it.&#148;

&#147;But you caught some of it.&#148; Sakura pointed out glumly, to which 
Tomoyo shook her head. &#147;Not all of it. I didn&#146;t catch onto the fact 
that Taro &amp; Ms. Tanashi were a couple until we learned about it today. 
I have to admit that they hid their relationship quite well.&#148;

&#147;They&#146;re cute though. Taro &amp; Ms. Tanashi.&#148; Sakura notes as she motions 
towards one side, where under another tree the two in question were 
happily eating, Taro&#146;s head rested on Ms. Taneshi&#146;s shoulder as they 
sat and ate in quiet contentment. &#147;They look so happy -- is it bad, 
though? I mean -- mama married papa when she was-- and Sonomi--&#148;

Tomoyo nods her head, &#147;I remember. It&#146;s not for everyone though, and 
remember that mama was in love with Nadeshiko so it hurt her when she 
married -- but for some finding a love that special is good even if it 
is a little bit on the Spring/Summer love thing.&#148;

&#147;?&#148; Sakura blanked out, leaving Tomoyo the job of explaining. &#147;I mean 
a younger person falling in love with an older love interest.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; (takes a bigger bite of her food as she thinks) &#147;They look happy 
when they&#146;re together.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure they&#146;re as happy as we are, Sakura-chan. I&#145;m happy, for 
instance, that Nadeshiko married your father.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;Because you wouldn&#146;t be here with me if they didn&#146;t get married, 
silly!&#148; she remarked, her face glowing with warmth as she reached out 
a hand to touch Sakura&#146;s smiling face. &#147;Now there&#146;s the happy 
Sakura-chan I know and love!&#148; Tomoyo cheerfully said, quickly pulling 
her video camera out, &#147;Hold that face for a few seconds while I get it 
on film!&#148;

&#147;-_-&#148; &lt; (Sakura, still smiling though)

------

School passed slowly.

Lina was getting the hang of her school work, and for Syaoran it was a 
snap.

But everyone else seemed distracted.

Even Rena&#146;s class at the end seemed to occasionally dangle for a few 
seconds until she caught herself and brought her class back into 
focus. Clearly her mind was wandering, and she knew the cause. Syaoran 
Li.

They had already agreed at lunchtime that they were not going to have 
his &#147;presence&#148; near Sakura for longer than they had to, so a plot was 
hatched. A plot first thought up in unison, and then discussed and 
worked out together. That plot, which they all agreed to, unfolded 
after school.

Rena asked Syaoran to meet her outside, and it was there that the 
three of them confronted him.

He didn&#146;t seem at all surprised. He simply stared at them as they 
ganged up on him, facing off against him three to one.

&#147;What the hell are you doing here?&#148; Keiko started in, eyes narrowed as 
she glared at him. &#147;The last thing we need is a loser coming into our 
turf and messing up the delicate order of things.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not here to steal Sakura.&#148; Li announced, waiting patiently for a 
reply (which wasn&#145;t long in coming). &#147;BULLSHIT!!&#148; Nina screamed, her 
own eyes blazing, &#147;Like a good toy solider you&#146;re here to ruin 
Sakura&#146;s life and make her your toy arentcha!! Wind her up and make 
her--&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t see where you got that notion--&#148;

&#147;Nina&#146;s a little overdramatic, but you get the gist of it.&#148; Rena took 
over, holding Syaoran&#146;s gaze tightly with her eyes, &#147;You&#146;re here to 
ruin Sakura&#146;s life aren&#146;t you? To take her away from Tomoyo--&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m here to help Sakura, not make her cry. I don&#146;t want to break her 
and Tomoyo up.&#148;

&#147;I heard you already make Meilin cry when you dumped her. What about 
that?&#148; Keiko spat at him, to which he lowered his gaze and sighed, 
&#147;She&#146;s my cousin. It just wasn&#146;t right.&#148;

&#147;Your not even that!&#148; Rena yelled, &#147;Technically she&#146;s not your cousin 
here! In the Realm of Dreams she&#146;s her own individual and not even 
related to you (thank the godawful dub for that)!&#148;, suddenly 
everything stopped. &#147;And I can&#146;t believe I mentioned that.&#148;

&#147;No kidding.&#148; (Keiko)

&#147;What were you thinking?&#148; (Nina)

&#147;Sorry!!&#148;

Attentions quickly focused back to him as Rena pulled out her Seeker 
and held it out in front of her, &#147;Easy enough way to solve this. Let&#146;s 
see your real motives.&#148;

As she held her Seeker forth he pulled his headset from his bag and 
put it on, mildly clicking it on as they looked on, &#147;Y-y-you arrogant 
ASS!&#148; Rena sputtered, watching him put his headset on as if they 
didn&#146;t mean nothing to him, ignoring all three as if they weren&#146;t 
there. &#147;I&#146;ll show you! ALRIGHT!! Old friend! Show me what secrets lie 
hidden beneath!&#148;

As she said those words the Seeker sprang to life, energy coursing 
through the small sphere as it gathered, focused that energy, and sent 
it forth into Rena and Li. But, as the light sprang forth, he simply 
etched a few signs into the air and whispered &#147;Novashields.&#148;

Almost immediately a sphere of light sprung into life, blocking the 
Seeker&#146;s beam from making contact with him. Dumbstruck by this the 
three stared at him, until Nina screamed out &#147;HE&#146;S A SPELLTHRASHER?!?&#148;

&#147;What??&#148; Keiko growled, drawing her sword, &#147;Fine. I&#146;ll break his 
shield down, you keep that focused.&#148;

&#147;No problem.&#148; Rena called out, her focus locked as she watched Keiko 
move forward. With her blade glistening in the bright afternoon light, 
Keiko advanced towards Li, his hand reaching for his own blade as he 
etched another spell in the air ready to strike.

&#147;STOP THAT!!&#148; From behind them Eliza leaped over the fence into the 
school yard, nearly falling over as she stumbled across the yard 
towards the four. Nina looked on in disbelief, &#147;What are you doing?!?&#148;

&#147;Sorry!&#148; she gasped, straightening herself, &#147;I was listening to 
Mirra/Hikaru eating lunch. They were talking about the kind of 
boyfriend Power wanted and she wanted one like me with---&#148;

&#147;I DON&#146;T WANT TO HEAR THAT!!&#148; Keiko screamed, walking back towards 
Eliza and the others looking rather fussy, Rena simply lost her 
concentration and the beam that was on Li turned off, &#147;That&#146;s 
disturbing!&#148; she muttered.

&#147;Look, forget about that for now!&#148; she demanded, pointing at him, 
&#147;Word from Command is that he&#146;s going to be under my command so you 
three don&#146;t you dare slash him up!&#148;

Nina, furious, stormed towards Eliza only to come to a dead halt as 
Eliza turned her gaze onto her, &#147;Nina?&#148;

The green haired girl shuffled her feet, and looked down, &#147;He&#146;s evil.&#148;

&#147;He&#146;s a young man who had to make decisions that weren&#146;t popular after 
he lost Sakura to Tomoyo. Besides which isn&#146;t Meilin happier now with 
the lover she has?&#148; (Nina nods her head) &#147;Then trust me when I say 
that Syaoran is--&#148;

&#147;Syaoran?&#148;

&#147;Syaoran.&#148; Eliza repeated, &#147;It&#146;s his name? Everyone thinks it&#146;s Li but 
it isn&#146;t.&#148;

&#147;I just say that because I hate him. Li, Li, Li, Li.&#148; (Keiko)

&#147;Ditto.&#148; Rena agrees, leaving only Nina to answer. &#147;Uhh---&#148; she 
stammers, blushing, &#147;It&#146;s easier to remember?&#148;

Li, dumbstruck by Eliza&#146;s presence, barely responds as Eliza asks him 
if he&#146;s alright. As she turns towards him he merely nods his head, and 
with great effort manages to stroll away without saying another word. 
&#145;Well,&#146; he thought to himself &#146;at least I didn&#146;t run away.&#146;

-----

The notion of Syaoran Li being a SpellThrasher didn&#146;t sit well with 
the trio.

The thought of having to work with him to capture the Clow Cards was 
even less appealing to them.

Sakura? She was happy, and Tomoyo was also happy to see another old 
friend again.

Keiko looked at the two over dinner as if they just admitted to being 
Amazonian and were showing their &#147;wares&#148; over the dinner table. 
&#147;You&#146;ve got to be kidding me.&#148; she rasped. &#147;You can&#146;t be serious about 
being happy to work with HIM. You can&#145;t be serious.&#148;

&#147;Why not?&#148; Sakura asked, looking confused, &#147;He&#146;s a friend.&#148;

&#147;He&#146;s YOUR friend, and of that even I have doubts over because would a 
friend try to steal the Clow Cards from you, then try to steal you 
from Tomoyo!? What kind of &#147;Friend&#148; is that anyway? The guy is an 
opportunistic snake if you ask me, and I don&#146;t see any reason to trust 
him. Didn&#145;t the first time, don&#145;t now.&#148;

&#147;B-but he&#146;s a nice guy!!&#148; Sakura countered bravely, even if she knew 
in her heart that Keiko was a far better debater than she was. Still, 
she had help in the form of Tomoyo who came to her aid, &#147;And he 
promised he wouldn&#146;t do anything to hurt Sakura, or myself.&#148;

&#147;And you trust him? Well you certainly do are a poor judge of 
character every so often aren&#145;t you!&#148;

The argument, though civilized, raged for ten minutes. Keiko did not 
give an inch, and neither did Sakura. When the two finally broke up 
Sakura was even more deadset on remaining a true friend to Syaoran no 
matter what. Still, as she sat next to Tomoyo doing her homework, the 
thought did occur to her &#147;Is he capable of doing bad things?&#148; she 
asked. Tomoyo looked up from her studies and smiled, &#147;Are you worried 
about what Keiko said?&#148;

&#147;Kinda---&#148; she admitted, &#147;---but Li&#146;s so nice and he wouldn&#146;t do 
anything bad to us, right? He&#146;s good.&#148;

&#147;Keiko has a hard time believing that. Maybe she has a good reason, 
maybe not, but what does your heart tell you about Syaoran?&#148;

Sakura closes her eyes and thinks, letting her feelings speak, then -- 
&#147;He&#146;s my friend, you&#146;re my precious, he won&#146;t come between us because 
he knows what we had once is over. I love you, Tomo-chan!&#148;

&#147;I know, I know.&#148; Tomoyo smiled, &#147;I&#146;m not putting you on the spot here 
or anything. Anyway, I have a feeling he has someone else on his 
mind.&#148;

&#147;How so?&#148;

&#147;Just a hunch. I&#146;ll tell you about it later.&#148;

Sakura&#146;s face scrunched up, &#147;You&#146;re mean!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m just waiting until I&#146;m certain. Now come on,&#148; (points at 
homework) &#147;finish up and I&#146;ll give my precious a treat tonight for 
being such a good study buddy this afternoon.&#148;

At that Sakura&#146;s mood picked up again, and all thoughts of Syaoran Li 
vanished as she focused only on Tomoyo, her hand scooping her pencil 
back up to do her homework.

------

Meilin seemed quieter tonight than usual. This worried Xai greatly as 
she looked on silently.

&#147;Is dinner alright?&#148; Xai asked, looking for any sign of reaction from 
Meilin. She hadn&#146;t said very much at all tonight, and she ate slowly 
as if deep in thought. Obviously something was bothering her, though 
as Xai prodded she only smiled and shook her head, picking up her pace 
slightly yet still looked quite bothered. &#147;What happened at school 
today? Did something upset you?&#148;

The room suddenly became even more silent as she stared at her food. 
For long moments she only stared, the sound of breathing filling the 
space between them, until she finally spoke in a soft whisper, 
&#147;Nothing.&#148;

&#147;Meilin I know you, and this isn&#146;t nothing, please --&#148; (her hand 
gently touches Meilin&#146;s, bringing her face up as they stared into each 
others eyes), &#147;--please?&#148;

&#147;Li showed up at school today. He--- he---&#148;

&#147;He did it, didn&#146;t he?&#148; Xai finally finished, to which she nodded her 
head meekly. &#147;I thought you were mistaken. When I arrived and he 
wasn&#146;t here yet I thought maybe he would have changed his mind.&#148;

&#147;Guess not.&#148; she noted, smiling weakly. At this Xai scoots herself 
over, and came to sit next to Meilin as she urges her to eat, arm 
wrapped around her shoulder. &#147;Do you still have -- feelings for him?&#148;

&#147;No -- but --&#148; she mutters, her voice trailing off. It takes a few 
prods, but shortly she&#146;s speaking again in soft whispers, &#147;---but I 
can&#146;t forget how he left me alone. How he went off to discover himself 
without even thinking of my feelings -- how I felt being all alone --&#148; 
Suddenly she slams her fork down on the plate and screams &#147;WHY DIDN&#146;T 
HE LOVE ME THE WAY I WANTED HIM TO LOVE ME?!?&#148;

Xai gently grabs the now struggling Meilin, and drags her into a 
strong hug, holding her tight as she yelled again, &#147;WHY DID HE ABANDON 
ME WHEN I NEEDED HIM THE MOST?!? WHY??? WHY???&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know.&#148; was Xai&#146;s only answer, her head resting against 
Meilin&#146;s shoulder as she held her tightly, until finally she stopped 
struggling and collapsed into Xai&#146;s strong grip, &#147;I didn&#146;t ask for 
much. Why didn&#146;t he return my affections for me? Why didn&#146;t he love 
me?? Why???&#148;

All Xai could do was comfort her, holding on as she cried. Finally, 
with strength borne within her heart over the years she asked, &#147;Do you 
love him more than me?&#148;

Meilin&#146;s eyes flew wide, her mouth suddenly dropped as she realized, 
&#147;NO! NO! I -- I love you -- but --&#148;

&#147;But?&#148; Xai repeated, making Meilin blush as she realized what she had 
said. With great resolve she straightened up, wiped her tears away, 
and clenched her fists. &#147;BUT NOTHING! I&#146;m not going to let him get to 
me anymore! From now on--&#148; (looks into Xai&#146;s eyes) &#147;---it&#146;s you and 
me. Now and forever.&#148;

As they kiss the two feel the warmth in their breasts growing, their 
feelings growing even stronger as they held each other. Finally they 
released, slowly Xai allowed Meilin back into her seat as she smiled, 
&#147;Just you and me now. I want you to depend on me as much as I depend 
on you, Ok?&#148;

&#147;Does that mean you want to be on top tonight?&#148; Xai kidded, to which 
Meilin smiled, &#147;I haven&#146;t been there before. Would be nice to see you 
at my &#147;mercies&#148; tonight. And I&#145;ve never got to play with the &#147;toys&#147; 
before so maybe tonight&#145;s the night---&#148; The two kiss one more time 
before eating, words failing to express at times what they felt they 
depended on their bodies to do it for them with gentle kisses and soft 
carresses. Still, one thing to Meilin was abundantly clear and certain 
in her heart of hearts.

&#147;This is Hamburger Helper.&#148; she noted, poking her food. &#147;I can&#146;t 
believe this is an old Transylvanian pasta dish. Do you believe that? 
It&#145;s Hamburger Helper.&#148;

&#147;Definitely.&#148; Xai remarks, going back to eating her food, &#147;But it&#146;s 
good anyway. Eat your food, dear.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m eating, I&#146;m eating. Still, it&#146;s Hamburger Helper.&#148;

&#147;Yes, precious, I noticed.&#148;

------

Li laid on his back in his new apartment staring at the ceiling.

His music was playing and yet it didn&#146;t provide him with any solace 
whatsoever.

The first day at school today? It seemed as if nothing could go right 
for him at all.

Running into the woman from his visions was a good start, but she 
seemed rather attached to the green haired female who was so violent 
towards him. Still, he felt it in his heart that they were destined to 
be.

As he fell asleep he hoped that he&#146;d see her again, in both reality 
and in his &#147;visions&#148;. His &#147;visions&#148; he didn&#146;t have to wait, that came 
almost immediately. Reality, however, wasn&#146;t going to be so easy.

&#147;I thought you left town to get laid, not to lay about.&#148;

Li&#146;s eyes narrowed. That annoyingly bossy voice could only be coming 
from one person. &#147;Karen.&#148; he muttered as he turned his headset off, 
sitting upright to see her. She was as arrogant looking as she was 
when she lectured him at the mall in Hong Kong, only now she was 
floating to one side in holographic form (projecting her thoughts to 
him). &#147;Don&#146;t tell me your boyish good looks and witty charm have 
failed you when you needed it the most.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not that charming.&#148; he grumbled, falling back down into a lying 
position as she watched, her holographic eyes narrowing as she glared 
at him. &#147;You can be such a wet blanket at times.&#148;

&#147;You didn&#146;t come &#147;here&#148; just to find out about my sex life.&#148;

&#147;Or lack theroft.&#148; she pointed out, looking about the room. &#147;Nope. I&#146;m 
calling because we got a call from a very irrate 7th Judgment over 
here. She isn&#146;t the slightest bit happy about us assigning a 
SpellThrasher to her sector, let alone one who assigned himself 
without anyone asking him to take the job.&#148;

&#147;Somebody had to take responsibility and help Sakura capture the 
cards.&#148;

&#147;And it had to be you, didn&#146;t it?&#148; Karen scoffed, huffing her breath 
at him as she did, &#147;Arrogant little bastard. No wonder she hates you 
as much as she sounded like she hates you from her commlink message.&#148;

&#147;She hated me long before I showed up here, I can assure you of that.&#148;

&#147;Oh don&#146;t go assuring ME of anything!&#148; she growled, &#147;I figured you 
were unlikable from the get-go.&#148;

&#147;So then---&#148; he muttered, looking up at her from his lying position, 
&#147;Why do you hang around me if I&#146;m such an unlovable individual?&#148;

&#147;Somebody has to. Your life would be shitty if I didn&#146;t brighten it 
with my presence each and every day.&#148;

&#147;Of course.&#148; he sighed, lying back down again. &#147;

&#147;Don&#146;t get me wrong. We&#146;d like nothing better than to snub the 
Judgments, no questions about it. Still, this IS Yamanaka we&#146;re 
talking about here.&#148; (makes a wide motion with her hands to show the 
immensity of it all) &#147;THE Keiko Yamanaka. The freakin&#146; 7th Judgment 
for God&#146;s sake! And for some reason you really had to piss on her the 
first day out and get her to call us to tell us how truly evil you 
are.&#148; (silence) &#147;Not that I didn&#146;t already know you were evil, so she 
was pretty much saying things I already knew.&#148;

&#147;Anything else?&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148; she muttered, looking at something out of &#147;sight&#148; (rifling 
through her &#147;memory&#148; in her mind to see what she had yet to say) &#147;Got 
a comm from Destiny over there. She says she&#146;s pleased with your 
deployment and she&#146;ll have your first orders for you soon. So far it 
looks like she&#146;s hinting at you being support in helping Sakura 
capture those Clow cards and not much else for now. Also I have this 
red banner from Command, looks like Black Ops just went under the 
&#147;radar&#148; again and people are speculating that a &#147;First Strike&#148; unit is 
being put together to travel to our newest &#147;moon&#148; in the sky. All 
SpellThrashers are to keep their eyes open and report any suspicious 
activities or goings on in terms of known Black Ops agents or 
facilities. Of special importance is the Black Ops station located on 
Crystallyia.*&#148; (* - Crystallyia, also known as the Dream Continent of 
Antarctica)

&#147;What importance is that to my &#147;mission&#148;?&#148;

&#147;Your self appointed mission? Some if they try to &#147;recruit&#148; Clow 
humans. Whatever you do? Don&#146;t let that happen. If you run into any 
Black Ops trying to recruit from Sakura&#146;s house? Stop them. But 
whatever you do? Don&#146;t tell Sakura or the others. Eliza already knows 
and she&#146;ll warn the cards about this possible &#147;recruitment&#148; tactic. 
Remember, however, the cards probably don&#146;t like you since they see 
you as a rival in trying to steal Sakura away from Tomoyo so they 
won&#146;t speak to you. Let Eliza handle that aspect of it and just wait 
for instructions to aid her in case a Black Ops team shows up to try 
and &#147;muscle&#148; them into joining. Ok?&#148;

&#147;Anything else?&#148;

Karen thinks for a second, then nods her head, &#147;Whoever this girl is? 
She must be one helluva looker to drag you all the way back to 
Nippon.&#148;, and with that she vanishes leaving Li alone once again.

&#147;You don&#146;t know the half of it.&#148;

------

The touch was gentle, yet present.

It started at her forehead and came down to her cheeks, and then to 
her lips.

So soft it was barely noticeable, but Tomoyo felt it.

She smiled as she felt Sakura&#146;s fingers gently touch her face, 
obviously meaning that the girl was still wide awake. As she opened 
her eyes she saw that Sakura was still up and looking worried.

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; she asked, Sakura fidgeting as she realized she woke 
Tomoyo from her sleep. Tomoyo smiled, sensing Sakura&#146;s unease at 
waking her and whispered, &#147;It&#146;s alright. Please, tell me.&#148;

&#147;I had a strange dream -- I mean vision -- I--&#148;

&#147;Tell me.&#148;

For a few seconds she didn&#146;t seem to want to, but a little more 
prodding helped her along. As she spoke she seemed very nervous, but 
slowly the images of what she saw in her vision started to come 
together.

She saw the tower again, but this time it felt different. Tokyo Tower 
was the same, yet different somehow. It was then that she realized 
that there was a moon in the sky, and the stars seemed odd somehow. 
The oddest being this object which seemed to be the sun, only 
eclipsed. An eerie ethereal glow surrounded the strange object, but 
what it was Sakura did not know. She only knew that it was strange to 
see this in the sky.

On the tower she saw seven figures, male and female, standing. She 
could feel their eyes staring, and wanted to join them but then she 
felt the ground beneath her fall away dropping her into darkness.

It was then that she saw the city fall away, then darkness, then the 
&#147;sphere&#148; floating in space above fall away into darkness, then 
nothing.

That&#146;s when she woke up.

Tomoyo didn&#146;t know what to make of the vision, she only could hold 
onto Sakura and comfort her. For now whatever sense could be made of 
the vision would have to wait until they knew more of what the world 
above them meant, and what awaited within. But in Tomoyo&#146;s mind a 
strange idea came.

Was that world a mirror image of their own? Was there another Tokyo 
waiting within it&#146;s hull?

Another Sakura maybe?

She shook those thoughts away and smiled, hugging Sakura tightly. One 
Sakura was enough for her.

As they fell back asleep she dreamed a happy dream of the two of them 
together, something she had been doing for abit now ever since Sakura 
freed her of her bad memories.

She wished in her heart that Sakura was dreaming the same dream, and 
that even in their sleep they would always be together.

Sakura, dreaming the same dream, made the same wish.

-----

The next day came, and it was back to school again.

More students returned to class. While it was not the full class yet 
they were slowly coming back in as the shock of what happened on New 
Year&#146;s was slowly beginning to wear off.

As for Syaoran Li&#146;s &#147;critics&#148;? Keiko, Rena, Nina and Meilin kept their 
distance from Li, while Sakura/Tomoyo gravitated towards him. It 
didn&#146;t help those who wanted to keep Li as far from them as possible 
that Sakura (who they were assisting with the recapture of the Clow 
cards) was gravitating towards the very person they were trying to 
keep her away from, but there was nothing they could do about it.

As for Lina? She didn&#146;t seem particularly interested in him to begin 
with, and mostly seemed to be on the lookout for a significant other 
to attach herself too.

Catherine Picadello? &#147;Anyone seen her since that &#147;thing&#148; came into 
ElseSpace?&#148; Keiko asked, to which everyone either shrugged or shook 
their heads. It seemed Catherine Picadello was MIA, and she wasn&#146;t the 
only one. Ms. Mitsuki was also missing, a new math teacher taking her 
place. Stranger and stranger.

Still, life went on and they had school to go through. Studying for 
final exams at the end of the school year was already underway, this 
to make it to the next grade, and since November they had been 
gathering up for &#147;Study Buddies&#148; (a concept coined by the Sailor Moon 
Dub and picked up as a &#147;theme&#148; concept for group studies sometime 
ago). Despite the fact that a strange menace hovered in the sky, and 
uncertainty filled the air, there was the real threat of final exams 
to consider. Life simply had to go on, regardless of what was 
happening in the world or above it.

The first one was always the hardest to plan, but Tomoyo made it easy. 
&#147;Let&#146;s study today at our place.&#148; she remarked, which everyone agreed 
to. When they asked Li to join them there was some obvious dissent, 
but he agreed and they had to live with it. Still, that didn&#146;t mean 
they had to like it.

As the day dragged on it was slowly becoming clear that this was a 
situation that none of the &#147;critics&#148; could change, as Eliza was 
deadset on having this new &#147;assistant&#148; SpellThrasher, and Sakura was 
insistent on having her friend near her (even if not everyone was an 
enamored with her &#147;friend&#148; as she was).

The first day of Study Buddies for the new year that had to include Li 
only made things worst for them.

As they all walked home together one rampant thought kept racing 
through Nina&#146;s head.

&#145;If I push him into the pond as we go through New King Penguin Park he 
might drown -- maybe if I shove him in front of a bus on the way home 
-- or push him into a wood chipper in the park -- maybe down a man 
hole into the mouth of a large reptile in the sewers -- or perhaps --&#146;

However it was in the park that Sakura suddenly stopped, her senses 
keenly picking up on something,

&#147;There&#146;s a Clow card nearby.&#148;

Everyone&#146;s attention turned towards her, watching, as she looked 
about, until she finally pointed into a set of bushes and whispered, 
&#147;It&#146;s in there, but---&#148;, before she could say another word Li was off 
dashing into the bushes. &#147;WAIT!&#147; Sakura yelled, &#147;It could be 
dangerous!!&#147;

Everyone was shocked/appalled at this, Keiko growling &#147;THAT&#146;S NOT YOUR 
JOB!!&#148; Seconds later he came out, and gave everyone a shock. He was 
foaming from head to toe in bubbles with the most very embarrassed 
face (which could barely be seen beneath the bubbles). &#147;It&#146;s not 
dangerous. Just curious.&#148;

Nina suddenly burst into laughter looking at him, followed by Keiko, 
Rena and finally Meilin. But Sakura was very serious as she drew her 
staff and sealed the card, taking it in hand, she then tapped the card 
and whispered &#147;Bubble&#148;, putting the card away. She then turned and 
glared at everyone laughing which quickly silenced the mood. She them 
smiled, and started laughing herself. For no reason she was laughing 
and they didn&#146;t understand.

Tomoyo takes hold of Sakura&#146;s hand and leads her and some of the 
others away, leaving the four behind, who were only now realizing that 
they were slowly being covered in bubbles.

&#147;Really mature there, Sakura. Really.&#148; Rena noted as she began 
brushing away the ever growing bubbles, &#147;Somebody&#146;s got a stick up 
their butt being so touchy about Li&#146;s &#147;feelings&#148;.&#148;

------

The minute they got home and Sakura announced the capture was the 
minute Li became popular to the Clow girls. They all wanted to use 
Bubble, and they all suddenly had a big change of heart about Li. 
After all, he brought home Bubble (the card) by helping Sakura capture 
it, so he was their hero.

Keiko was miffed about this turn of &#147;events&#148;, as was the other 
&#147;Critics&#148; of Syaoran Li. Only Nina seemed to be partially accepting of 
Li, and that was only because Eliza insisted on it.

Still, he did &#147;help&#148; to capture a card, and was pretty OK with being 
embarrassed like that in front of everyone so maybe he could be given 
a chance.

Study buddies went off without a hitch, except for the occasionally 
mis directed Clow girl almost walking in on the group bare naked 
(except for strategically placed bubbles) giggling like crazy and 
looking for their own bedrooms.

Today was the first full day that Syaoran was part of the group, and 
it seemed to go off rather well.

He broke the ice, and made some friends. He still had someway to go, 
but for now it seemed he was settling in. For now.

That night Sakura decided to use the bubble card for herself and 
Tomoyo to celebrate the capture.

But that&#146;s a lemon story.
