<h1>True Love Waits (in itsy bitsy pieces) (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kanzaki.html">Ms. Kanzaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/truluvwaits-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>A man in his mid-forties opens the door. The first ready comment anyone 
could have is that this man indeed does not show his age. And if they 
knew the one tragedy that casts a shadow on his life, they&#146;d be more 
surprised; for this auburn haired father with round spectacles still 
cherises &#150;and misses- the woman that once shared his life.

Li Syaoran greets this man in his solemn yet kind manner.

- Ohayo gozaimasu, Kinomoto-sama.

- Ohayo, Li-kun. Please make yourself comfortable while I call Sakura.

- Arigato gozaimasu, Kinomoto-sama.

Kinomoto Fujitaka took a long stare at this well-dressed and mannered 
young man. There was something- different about him. 

Trouble in the air? No, he seems well in control&#133;

- Li-kun?

- Yes?

Fujitaka walked to his side, and layed a hand on one of the strong 
shoulders of Syaoran.

- Nothing. I&#146;m glad you arrived. With you here it&#146;s more than sure that 
my little girl shall smile again.

My eyes may have widened, I admit. But I was not so surprised. 
Kinomoto-sama, in my opinion, seems to have an otherwordly wisdom.

Steps being lightly pounded by his feet. Knock knock. Murmurs, since I 
can&#146;t hear what they&#146;re saying, but have a good idea what it is.

Heading downstairs, a rather hurried stomp. I turn from my seat at the 
large sofa and watch my Sakura jump the last step and land right next to 
the table with a white vase and a photo of her mother. 

Yeah, right&#133; I&#146;m not supposed to attach to her name a possessive noun. 
Old habits are hard to break&#133;

&#133; yet I dare say she has started with the process herself. By the look 
on her face, and her hand gesturing that we&#146;d talk outside. 

Funny, I expected you to come today.

I nod. Then I&#146;ll make this quick. And no sooner I spoke she stepped 
forward.

I hand her back the Dream card. She smiles, and turns to make her way 
upstairs when suddenly she adds, &#147;Syaoran-kun&#148;.

Yes?

Arigato for everything. I learned so much from you&#133; and I wonder if you 
could make it tonight to Rika-chan&#146;s house. Tomoyo-chan&#146;s leaving for 
New York some time next week and I&#146;m making her a farewell party&#133; one 
last get-together among the best of friends.

I could perfectly tell that as she said this her eyes lost a bit of 
their flickering quality. My hand reached out to one of hers, and held 
it softly.

- Hey, don&#146;t think about what still doesn&#146;t happen. Focus on giving 
Daidouji-san a good time- AND a nice surprise.

Now those emerald jewels were showing how dumbfounded she felt with my 
comment. She murmured my name and was ready to take her left hand to 
slip the ring I gave her off her finger. I shook my head back in refusal 
of her gesture.

I kissed her for the last time. Sakura, who for almost a lifetime was my 
love, the center of my universe.

Did you know I dreamed about you back at the same day we captured Yume? 
I loved you since then, I&#146;ll always love you. Just that my time with you 
has passed. This ring I gave you- give it to someone else&#133; a child, an 
old person, a man, or a woman. Who you truly love.

Then he walked in his slow, steady manner, out of the door.

My eyes were now stinging. Yet the smile did not leave me. 

And as I watched him leave, I murmured to the wind, to the butterflies, 
to the flowers&#133; Arigato, Syaoran!

-----------------
parenthesis &#150; Art Surpasses Life

I murmured to the wind, to the butterflies, to the flowers&#133; Sakura-chan&#133;

&#133; for I had no other words while leaning on the windowsill looking 
outside.

Too many things to do yet. And so little time. You could only limit to 
thinking that while glancing at the piles and piles of tapes, photo 
albums and canvases she ever embarked on filling since she met her.

&#147;And I can&#146;t believe I&#146;m actually devising a way to have them all 
delivered to me in New York in a month!&#148;.

It was anyone&#146;s guess the feelings going through her if they learned 
she&#146;s been the last few nights without much sleep watching &#145;til the 
first minutes of the dawn the many videos she recorded amid the haze of 
her existence alongside the spriteful brunette. She&#146;d like to fancy at 
times she injected all her passion for art with the drug distilling out 
of everything Kinomoto Sakura did and did not do. Singing, snapping 
photos, recording video, painting, sketching!! Goddess! No wonder people 
think I&#146;m a creepy character! Any psychiatrist will have to agree this 
is obsession! OBSESSION!!

She laughed, that petite laugh of hers. People could say whatever they 
wanted. She never cared enough for what they thought anyways. After all, 
theirs lives weren&#146;t in any form being touched by the Card Mistress, so 
they could never understand the discreet magic she worked on those she 
encountered. For instance, Grandfather never ceased to ask for her; 
mother, whenever Sakura visits, always manages to step into our activity 
or conversations, and spend a while in her company; Syaoran returned to 
Japan just for her&#133; Just for her.

And here I am leaving because of her!

She fights back the tears, though. When she planned this trip she 
promised she&#146;d only be away for as long as it took to leave aside her 
feelings and move on. But now that I&#146;m viewing the tapes, paging the 
albums, contemplating my oils and sketches- how long will that be?

The truth is that I love you, and sooner or later that truth shall kill 
me! Before I realize what I&#146;ve done, my fingers have pressed &#147;play&#148; on 
the DVD&#146;s remote control, and there you are, right in front me, smiling, 
smiling that big, warm smile of yours. 

And I&#146;m in tears. They&#146;ve gone out, violated my will. I&#146;m losing myself 
in a nightmare. The emptiness. Like the blackness that follows the 
recorded portions of a tape. Right after the dream.

The dream that means each event reproduced in every item here.

My muscles loosen a bit. My dreams. I&#146;ve forgotten about them amid the 
turmoil of these days. A buzz. A message has reached my cell phone. 
Okay. Rika&#146;s mailing to invite me over to a reunion she&#146;s holding for 
Yamazaki-kun&#146;s trip to Boston. He got that scholarship for Harvard. 
Must&#146;ve told them in that personal essay plenty of high tales&#133; but who 
wouldn&#146;t? It&#146;s for his future.

I&#146;ve told them as well for mine. To her especially. I&#146;ll go, if just to 
see her one last time along with our old group of friends. Then I&#146;ll 
just glance at her while at the concert. My eyes in the evening shall be 
those of a man lost in the desert.

Until later this day, I&#146;ll just keep watching my tapes. Perhaps finish 
the painting. Lose myself in sleep, in art. I&#146;m having an idea to even 
edit a tape&#133; After that, I&#146;ll begin the process of cutting myself off 
from these never-meant-to-be dreams.

A process, you all must agree, that will take her the rest of her life. 
A life that&#146;ll sometimes have that bite eased by the sight of the New 
York skyline.

----------------

parenthesis 2 : Truth On Video and Off It

I just hate sounding tragic about it. But this may well be my last 
chance to do something right in my life.

Not that I haven&#146;t done good things&#133; Then again playing as a Master in 
an RPG doesn&#146;t count at all.

Yep, you&#146;ve read right. That&#146;s how I&#146;d sum my role &#150;though Kero says and 
once even made me believe it was a duty- as a Card Mistress.

Just for now, I&#146;m not going any deeper on that matter. Despite some 
inconveniences, it&#146;s still one of the best things to ever happen to me.

- &#133; like my friends here tonight! I&#146;m so glad all of you could make it 
at a last minute call!-, sighed in relief Kinomoto Sakura.

- Are you implying that otherwise you wouldn&#146;t have called us, 
Kinomoto-san?

Yamazaki was piercing her with his skeptical glance. He grinned as he 
noticed the sweat appearing on the young brunette&#146;s forehead, and knew 
it was his signal to begin&#133;

Have you&#133; have you ever heard of the &#147;Last Minute Party&#148; curse??

Huh??

All the attention the skinny looking dark haired boy could ever wish for 
was set on him. Yep, after many years, we still listen to every little 
thing he comes up with!

- In ancient Egypt, many festivities existed so there would be 
celebrations going on every week. But Egyptians were fond as well of 
finding gods in whatever object or phenomenon they stumbled upon, so 
this would multiply at least five more times the festivities calendar&#133;

He turned to check behind his back. Just in case you-know-who ruins your 
fun by dragging you out.

- &#133; And so it happened that the entire year was full, and no one had 
work. One day, an apprentice to the high priest of Ra decided to play a 
prank on everyone by making up a festivity and denounced at the town 
square the unworthiness of all the people because they failed to please 
the deity by holding a party,- If there was a better moment to add 
Yamazaki&#146;s master acting skills, this was one!, since the girls swore he 
looked identical to that mischievious character. - The townspeople 
looked at each other in awe and fear, and marched off quickly to prepare 
the celebrations, all in accordance to the instructions of the young 
apprentice&#133;

- Gods! Strike me down now!

This time it was Rika who sweated a bit. Naoko, the girl with 
round-framed glasses, giggled; and Sakura snapped out of her amazement. 
Yamazaki was in for it!

The line previously heard was delivered in the most exasperated tone 
ever employed by any human being. The employer was an average height, 
slim built girl with an odd-colored brown hair with golden highlights, 
and though normally sweet yet now fiery dark eyes. 

Her friends say she&#146;s named Chiharu. I&#146;ve checked her student ID and it 
states the same. Heck! Even her personal papers say that! 

And that&#146;s the name engraved on the ring she gave me too.

Ah jeez! I forgot I engraved mine on the ring she has and that surely is 
now printed as well at the top of my head!

- You deserve that knuckle sandwich! Baka! What would happen if Harvard 
gets a hold on all the lies you&#146;ve told throughout the years?! 

I smile and say they&#146;ll just probably send me directly to the Central 
Intelligence Agency. She sighs in her kawaii defeated look and drags me 
off to the table.

- Well, enough story-telling! &#150; Chiharu grabs a glass and starts pouring 
a drink. &#150; I bet everyone&#146;s thirsty!

All those gathered here tonight scream a joyous hai. I only stay behind 
a bit to adjust the video camera &#150; I must make sure the settings are 
perfect&#133; and that I get the hang of this thing just in time! Whew! Never 
thought Tomoyo-chan surely had to dedicate plenty of time to master 
these machines! But with all the times she&#146;s chased me with a camera&#133;

&#133; She&#146;s running. Running after me&#133;

No, that was then&#133; Now, it&#146;s away&#133; away from me.

She shakes her head. The doorbell rings. The image must leave if she 
wants to be in the fullest self-control possible.

The door opens. 

Surprise!!!!

It&#146;s us greeting you. 

It&#146;s you who have walked right through the door, and into the many hugs 
of the gang. 

I&#146;m, however, standing a bit apart. Like you do usually when recording. 
Those eyes of yours are as intense as ever&#133; yet they&#146;re elusive, 
probably half in wonder why am I handling the camera in this occasion, 
and half&#133; half&#133; 

Escaping.

You&#146;re out to break me, aren&#146;t you?

The party, Yamazaki and the girls showering me with unexpected gifts for 
my trip, Sakura-chan recording. What is it? No, what I meant- how did 
they- why is she doing this?! It dawns on me after a while that it was 
she who engineered this reunion, this get-together before I leave, 
perhaps forever, to New York. But the awkwardness caused by all the 
above questions is not as much as strong as my sadness. 

A while has past. And not a word have we exchanged.

She&#146;s not and never will be aware of my suffering at this moment.

- Ano, Sakura-chan&#133;

- Huh?

- The girls and I are wondering why Li-kun isn&#146;t here too.

Her emerald eyes, a precious inheritance from her mother, left the image 
on the display screen of the camera for a few seconds. She looked right 
back at Naoko-chan, whose brown eyes were posing more than curiosity 
behind the lens of her lightweight glasses.

- Ah! I forgot to tell you guys that Li-kun can&#146;t be here tonight 
because-

- Because he had to look for a disc perfect for Daidouji-san!- shouted a 
gleeful Meiling as she sprung the door open.

The typical whisper of &#147;boy! does she know how to make an entrance!&#148; was 
well heard in the lips of her companion, who held up in the air the disc 
in question.- Didn&#146;t think we&#146;d make it for a moment- he added.

Their arrival seemed more normal to the others, but certainly not to 
Tomoyo nor Sakura, although the latter was extremely pleased. Pleased 
enough to leave the camera and run to greet in a hug both descendants of 
the mage Clow Reed, and to her the dearest of friends in these past 
days.

I&#146;m glad you&#146;re here, Syaoran&#133; I examine Meiling and am surprised with 
how little she&#146;s changed- let alone the physical part (still lean yet 
looking like a fine antique Chinese porcelain figure, with the raven 
hair still styled in odangos, and her soft reddish brow eyes enmarked by 
a pair of skeptically lined brows). It&#146;s easy to see that her features 
tell on the determined, practical girl I once knew.

I go over to where they are. Bowing my head, a grateful smile on my 
lips. Nice way to acknowledge guests. Li-kun gives me this look. He 
requests we have a talk in a few minutes. I nod in agreement. All 
without saying a word. 

Now it&#146;s Meiling and Sakura-chan glaring at the exchange. Syaoran 
returns the stare, but he accompanies the gesture with handing over to 
both of them the disc. Play it on the stereo. I&#146;m sure Daidouji-san will 
be pleased with the first of my gifts to her. 

He winks as well. We&#146;re now left alone while the rest gather in a 
curious crescent moon around the bearers of the disc, who are just about 
to press &#147;play&#148; on the Sony sound system Rika-san owns.

- You know, those stairs over there seem to be the most private and 
comfortable spot in such a wide-spaced home design.- he ventured.

- Yes. Lets sit over there and talk, Li-kun.

A piano sounding from the stereo. Tomoyo could tell perfectly it 
belonged to her own sliding fingers, when the band and her were 
starting.

- Like the gift?

- I&#133; I must confess I&#146;m a bit dumbfounded. I never expected you to&#133;

- &#133; to be a fan of yours, Daidouji-san? Well, truth is my admiration for 
you didn&#146;t start right away- I liked your performances at the school 
choir back when we were kids, but never went ga-ga like Sakura did. One 
might say that aging, physically, mentally and spiritually, has changed 
my perception. It has not only taught me to appreciate the emotion 
burning behind your music, but to perceive it as well in your painting 
and your filming. The day I began to understand all of this, and I must 
say not only did my appreciation change concerning you but of others 
too, even my magic made a grand progress&#133;

His pause here, not just to take a sip of the drink handed earlier by 
Chiharu, was a bit longer than usual.

- &#133; and you know perfectly that after Sakura made hers all of the Clow 
Cards I never expected my magical abilities to make a progress at all! I 
may have been a bit jealous over her all these years despite our love 
because of her victory at the final Judgment, and somewhat a bit 
distrustful of others. Yet, she,-and he took a bit of time to glance at 
the figure of Sakura, who was laughing at a cheap impersonation of a 
professor made by Yamazaki- she changed all that. Very slowly, almost 
snail-like, but she did it. Every time she dragged me to your concerts, 
every time she made me sit through a Hollywood film, every time she had 
me do the talking whenever we encountered friends or we were making new 
ones. I owe her much more than I could ever pay her with&#133; 

- &#133; which is why you&#146;re choosing to fly back to Hong Kong and end your 
relationship with her. Am I right on this, Li-kun?

He wasn&#146;t surprised on her response, nor questioned himself as usual on 
how could she tell many things without one trying to give too much away. 
He shook his head and had his hand take one of hers.

- Yes, but it&#146;s not the reason you&#146;re implying. It&#146;s not just I who has 
outgrown her. She has done it as well with me. But I must not say no 
more on this.- he paused once more, and took a long sip- Talk to her, 
Daidouji-san, talk to her. The truths that the Dream Card revealed to us 
back then and now are not just for haunting our hearts. They&#146;re for 
taking them into our hands and doing the right things in our lives.

Tomoyo was now blinking in confusion. Yet I&#146;m fully aware of what he&#146;s 
saying in these mist-shrouded words. I try to utter something, anything. 
He stands up and bows.

Arigato, Daidouji-san. Please reconsider your decision. Meiling and I 
wish you the best of luck.

Take care, Li-kun, Meiling-san.

I watch how they say to all a quick goodbye and promise out loud that 
they&#146;ll keep in contact. He hugs once again Sakura, and they stay like 
that for about a minute or two. 

They both look perfectly at ease. And after they let go, Sakura 
accompanies them to the door, and shuts it herself once she&#146;s done 
waving goodbye to the speeding car.
