<pre>Yet another day ends.

I am Kinomoto Sakura, 17. I am a happy, naive, carefree girl...
or at least that&#39;s what I should be. 

I collapse onto my bed, careful not to bend any of the Tomoyo 
pictures scattered on my bed. I have boyfriend... Syaoran. I 
love him, or loved him, really. our relationship used to be fun,
it used to be deep... it has become a chore, something I must 
endure.

I pick up a picture of Tomoyo. She is so beautiful. I love her
hair, I love her eyes...

I love her.

&quot;No...Syaoran is my &#39;special person&#39;&quot; I whisper to myself.

but my heart tells me otherwise.

The next morning I wake up, excited for the day to start. 
I will walk to school with Tomoyo.

As I walk next to her, holding her hand tightly, I hope 
that we never get to school.. it stays like this forever.
Laughing, not a care in the world... I look into her deep
eyes. They are like wells, endless, exposing herself to the 
world. I know she loves me... she confessed when we were
14. I really should of realized it earlier, she is obsessed 
with every detail about me... and I, the same with her. 

only if she knew...

&quot;Chan-chan...I...&quot; suddenly, we get to school, and the spell
that wraps us together is broken. I look up to see Syaoran, 
waiting for me. He greets me with nothing but a grunt, the 
closest thing I have received to an &quot;I love you&quot; in years. I 
look to Tomoyo, to save me, help me, but she either doesn&#39;t 
get what I mean or decides not to help. she walks away, saying,

&quot;I&#39;ll see you later, Sakura-chan&quot;

And she does that sweet smile. god, Tomoyo, don&#39;t do that to me.
that smile... it makes me shiver. 

&quot;ahem.&quot; Syaoran breaks me out of my utopia.

&quot;oh, um... what&#39;s up?&quot; I reply.

&quot;there is something I need to tell you...&quot; Syaoran says.

&quot;I am going back to Hong Kong. I don&#39;t fit here... Hong
Kong is where I belong. I think that we should break this 
off... I know the gap between us is only getting wider. I 
know about... Tomoyo.&quot; 

Her name sends shivers down my spine. I&#39;m sad to see Syaoran 
go, but now, the two words &quot;Tomoyo&quot; and &quot;Sakura&quot; can finally 
be together.

I throw my arms around Syaoran and say my final words to him.

&quot;thank you.&quot;
