The night of the &#147;Taste of Tokyo&#148; event.

&#147;So tell me again how many businesses you conned into setting up here 
for this---&#148;

&#147;Shut up, Nina.&#148;

&#147;Because it&#146;s a nice set-up and all, but considering there&#146;s a crazed 
Clow card in the lake over there your setting up a lawyer buffet line 
if someone gets hurt. And they usually come running at the first sign 
of an ambulance.&#148;

&#147;And who&#146;s fault is THAT for not catching the card? Think that was 
your job, wasn&#145;t it.&#148;

&#147;Who blocked the park off so we couldn&#146;t catch the second card without 
drawing attention to ourselves? It goes both ways, Misho.&#148;

&#147;Whatever.&#148; Misho NamoCatCat finally relented, her tail swinging in 
the air as the catgirl leaned against one of the booth counters and 
waited for their food. &#147;Since your such a know-it-all why don&#146;t you 
take a flying leap into the lake and capture the card with your bare 
hands? Wrassle&#146; it down like a croc on that movie with that guy in the 
khaki shorts.&#148;

&#147;Crocodile Hunter. Yeah, I heard you sunk money into that movie&#145;s 
production to get an environmental group off your back because they 
said you were nature indifferent.&#148; Nina remarks, smirking as she does, 
&#147;Don&#146;t you like crocodiles? I heard your not making a single yen off 
the movie.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s going to a preservation fund for wild animals. I like keeping 
the nutty animal rights groups off my front door if I even look like 
I&#146;m giving to some sort of animal thingee. Anyway if it keeps wild 
cats wild and feed &#145;em it&#146;s kudos for my personal tastes in animals.&#147; 
(sneers) &#147;Though if that movie beats Powerpuff Girls the movie in 
ticket sales it just goes to show how sick the movie going public is 
these days. I mean, really! I didn&#146;t even think that lame Like Mike 
would get anywhere and look at it.&#148;

&#147;You look at it, that movie scares me--- speaking of look, I noticed 
you still like Tomoyo watching after all this time.&#148;

Misho frowns and redirects her attention back to the booth. &#147;None of 
your business.&#148;

&#147;I remember the in-house version of the manga. Didn&#146;t you bankroll 
that yourself (holovids and all) just so you could shoot near her? You 
don&#146;t still have that hopeless infa--&#148; (Misho&#146;s hands suddenly grab 
Nina by the collar of her kimono and hoists her up) &#147;You have no idea 
what it&#146;s like to be me. So why don&#146;t you do me a favor and shut up.&#148; 
(shoves Nina back into Eliza). &#147;Get out of my face.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;There&#146;s Sakura and Tomoyo. Think that&#145;s Mirra also&#148; Eliza offers, 
pointing off in one direction.

&#147;Yeah. Let&#146;s go hook up--- if we can wade through this crowd.&#148;

Eliza changes the subject, &#147;Well, that ended rather well with Misho. 
Don&#146;t you think?&#148;

&#147;What I think is that she&#146;s still a sexually frustrated cat with a 
unattainable crush. Personally I&#146;d rather not think about the kind of 
unbearable grudge she has against Sakura.&#148;

&#147;Well that&#146;s a first--&#148; (Nina looks over at Eliza questionably) &#147;You 
defending &#147;Snoozer&#148; I mean.&#148;

&#147;Nobody harasses the Snoozer but me, Eliza. And definitely not a Neko 
in heat like Misho.&#148; (quickly changes the subject as they catch up to 
Sakura/Tomoyo) &#147;Hey, Tomo! Snoozer staying awake?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m NOT Snoozer!!&#148; (Sakura suddenly sighs) &#147;And why did you bring 
Toya with us?&#148; (motions at Mirra-chan who&#146;s fascinated with Toya) 
&#147;Well?&#148;

&#147;I wanted to get your goat?&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan---&#148; Tomoyo quickly jumps in, deflecting Sakura&#146;s anger. 
&#147;She&#146;s just worried about you, and wanted to make sure Mirra-chan is 
safe in case there&#146;s any incident at the lake.&#148;

&#147;I guess---&#148; (smiles as she peers over at Mirra-chan/Hikaru) &#147;--but 
since Mirra-chan brought Hikaru to be here with her I&#146;m happy.&#148;

Nina nudges Eliza aside, whispering as she does, &#147;Snoozer should stick 
to card captor-ing, because she makes a lousy Cupid. All that snoozing 
and eating---&#148;

&#147;I heard that!&#148; Sakura grumbles, bumping Nina aside as she does. 
&#147;Carmel apples! Quick, get some for us!&#148;

&#147;Yeah, Toya! Get some for---&#148; Nina stops as she notices Sakura 
pointing at her and not Toya. &#147;W-wh-what?!? Your rich enough, you do 
it! (Don&#146;t freeload off my expense account you loser!) And why are 
they selling that stuff here at a food---&#148; (looks at booth and sighs) 
&#147;---oh, it&#146;s another NamoCatCat Foods business. Of course. What Taste 
of Tokyo fair is complete without the self serving need to promote 
one&#146;s own food businesses no matter how unrelated to the topic of the 
fair the business is. Damn.&#148;

Sakura, however, isn&#145;t in the mood for explanations. &#147;Stop 
complaining! Your living under Tomoyo&#146;s roof AND you haven&#146;t helped 
once where it counts!&#148; (shoves Nina towards the stand) &#147;ALRIGHT! 
ALRIGHT! I&#146;LL DO IT!!&#148; (grumbles as Sakura starts cheering) &#147;Damn 
Misho! Investing in that chain of caramel apple stands at local parks, 
what was she thinking?!? (And stop doing that! Act your age already, 
Snoozer! Should have called her Howdy! Damn her)---&#148; (seconds later 
she returns) &#147;Eliza first. Then Mirra &amp; Hikaru, Tomoyo, Toya, Yuki---&#148;

&#147;What about me?!&#148;

&#147;Yeah, here. Me then you.&#148; (smirks as Sakura huffs her breath in 
anger). &#147;Whatever, Snoozer, whatever.&#148; (looks at Eliza) &#147;Tell me if 
you want seconds.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine for five or ten minutes.&#148;

Sakura pushes her way in front of Nina, &#147;Aren&#146;t you bring rude making 
it sound like Eliza&#146;s a pig!&#148;

&#147;Not like you, the genuine kawaii-pig, right?&#148; (Sakura fumes at that) 
&#147;BUT for your information Eliza is Amazonian, so her metabolism 
coverts food into energy.&#148;

&#147;So she can run fast, or lift more?&#148; Tomoyo asks. Briefly Nina looks 
about, noticing Mirra-chan &amp; Hikaru has moved on to explore on their 
own, before she motions for everyone to draw closer.

&#147;So she can cast magic. Haven&#146;t used that yet because, well, we put 
all our eggs into the Snoozer basket here---&#148; (brings another huff 
from Sakura) &#147;---so Eliza hasn&#146;t dusted off her mojo yet. But if 
Sakura here ever drops the ball, Eliza&#146;s here to pick up the pieces.&#148;

&#147;BUT I&#146;m just here to keep Nina company, rules state that only Sakura 
has the power to capture Clow cards. I&#146;m just companionship material.&#148; 
Eliza quickly throws in. (Which in turns makes Sakura all smiles from 
that announcement, which is something that can&#146;t be said of Nina).

&#147;---uh---&#148; (Yuki speaking now) &#147;---how much do you eat?&#148;

&#147;Well---&#148; Eliza looks over at Nina, then genuinely thinks about the 
answer. &#147;Well. Today I ate breakfast at the estate, then picked up a 
wrap in town to eat with a bag of chips, then ate two box lunches that 
Sakura made for me &amp; Nina (Nina usually gives me her lunch whenever 
Sakura makes it)---&#148; (looks at Sakura) &#147;---and I really shouldn&#146;t have 
mentioned that. Then there&#146;s the meal Nina makes for me after--- well, 
after. Then we ate dinner out at an all you can eat buffet before 
coming here and I already ate the full wares of six booths---&#148;

&#147;What happens if you don&#146;t cast magic tonight?&#148;

&#147;Then I expend my excess energy in bed with Nina while we--&#148;

&#147;I DON&#146;T WANNA HEAR ABOUT IT!!&#148; Sakura yells, grabbing Tomoyo and 
dragging her off.

&#147;Well I never--&#148; Nina drags Eliza after Sakura.

&#147;--is that normal--?&#148; Yuki asks, but gets no reply as they follow the 
four. That is, before the scream catches everyone&#146;s attention.

&#147;Now what?!&#148;

&#147;That came from the lake, Nina.&#148; Eliza notes, pointing back the way 
they came and off in one direction. &#147;Oh.&#148; Nina sighs as she watches 
the chain of girls spew out into the main &#147;street&#148; of booths. &#147;And 
here I thought we were actually taking the day off. Silly me.&#148;

Nina walks to the small crowd, claps her hands and draws everyone&#146;s 
attention.

&#147;HELLO!! PEOPLE!! WHAT DID YOU--&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re not deaf. We can hear you.&#148;

&#147;Oh. Well, what did you---&#148;

All the girls answer at once, &#147;A woman in a kimono who looked like she 
drowned.&#148;

Silence.

Nina - &#147;Any reason in the world you can&#146;t wait five friggin&#146; seconds 
for me to finish my sentence?&#148;

Silence.

Nina - &#147;---never mind---&#148; (walks off) &#147;---try the caramel apples if 
you haven&#146;t already.&#148; (sheesh)

------------------------------------------------------------

The lakeside (five minutes later)

Eliza looks over the water as she waits for Sakura. &#147;Is she ready 
yet?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll check-- hey, Snoo--&#148;

&#147;PERVERT!! I&#146;M NAKED!!&#148; (Nina is thrown out of the bushes and lands on 
her butt)

&#147;---I&#146;d give it another five minutes. Though I can see what stirs 
Tomoyo&#145;s loins when it&#145;s bed--&#148;

&#147;I HEARD THAT!!&#148;

&#147;Oh. Nina, come over here---&#148; Nina stands up, rubbing her rear (from 
the fall on her butt), as she walks over to where Eliza is, staring 
into the water. &#147;I thought I saw something down there, a brief flicker 
of light and movement.&#148;

&#147;Where?&#148; (looks down) &#147;Maybe it was reflected moonlight.&#148;

&#147;No. It must have been the card, but it&#146;s too shy now to come out.&#148;

&#147;Wasn&#146;t too shy for those girls. Maybe it likes &#145;em young. Of course 
Sakura is the height of a little girl so maybe it thought she was 
tasty little Lolita treat--&#148;

&#147;I HEARD THAT TOO!!!&#148; (Sakura stomps out of the brush wearing her 
costume, fuming mad) &#147;Now, now Sakura-chan---&#148; (Tomoyo follows right 
behind her trying to calm her down, but Sakura was on a roll) &#147;YOUR 
RUDE!!&#148;

&#147;And your bossy and loud, crank it down five and come over here. Eliza 
saw the card.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; (Sakura quickly rushes over and leans over, looking down into 
the water) &#147;Where?&#148;

Nina smirks, &#145;Bet Tomo&#146;d get a real kick seeing Sakura&#146;s breasts 
through that top once I--&#146; (Eliza grabs Nina&#146;s arm and pulls her to 
one side, stepping between the two) &#147;What are you doing?&#148;

&#147;You had that look in your eye.&#148; Eliza whispers, pulling Sakura back 
from the railing. &#147;It was only a glimpse of something that might have 
been something. Nothing concrete I&#146;m afraid.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; (shakes her head abit as she steps back, sweating bullets now) 
&#147;So it might not be a card.&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan, if you don&#146;t want to---&#148;

&#147;No, Tomo-chan, I must. People are scared and it&#146;s my duty to capture 
that card.&#148;

&#147;If it is a-- OUCH! Eliza!!&#148; (Eliza gives Nina a soft but stern look) 
&#147;--your no fun--&#148;

&#147;Anyway---&#148; (tears start flowing down Sakura&#146;s face) &#147;--we have to 
pass here to get home! I have to capture that card or--&#148;

&#147;Or it&#146;ll give Sakura paranoid complexes forever and--&#148; (sighs) &#147;--I 
know, I know, zip it. Sigh---&#148; (removes kimono to show her work 
uniform beneath it, passes kimono to Eliza as she takes out a few 
armbands from her pouch (one large and a few smaller ones)). &#147;First 
off, new commlinks (frees up your hands since they&#146;re sensitive to 
motion). Make a fist twice in rapid succession and the device 
triggers.&#148; (holds up arm as she slaps device on and demonstrates) 
&#147;Like this. Squeeze-squeeze and---&#148; (link comes on) &#147;It&#146;s sensitive to 
movement in the arm. Two quick squeezes makes the appropriate area 
flex and the device picks that up and activates. This also has a touch 
pad for data transmissions if vocal is impossible. It can work 
underwater, but only up to a certain depth--&#148; (looks at lake) &#147;--but 
since this lake is nowhere near that deep that shouldn&#146;t be a problem. 
Still it can&#146;t take a set amount of pressure. If the pressure starts 
to strain the device it&#146;ll start to emit a pinging noise that&#146;ll 
signal it&#146;s integrity is failing. If you have a message it&#146;ll vibrate. 
Oh, and here---&#148; (attaches larger gauntlet to left arm) &#147;This is my 
neural gauntlet. I already put five of my best cards in there. It&#146;s 
something I use for my Duel Monster stuff. If you run into trouble 
trigger &#147;Swords of Revealing Light&#148; and that&#146;ll paralyze the thing. I 
put a few good cards too like Castle Walls &amp; Reinforcements (boosts 
defense and attack respectively), and I put in Magical Boxes (just in 
case ). Now here&#146;s a re-breather mask, with a ten minute oxygen yield. 
Just in case.&#148; (hands it off, helping Sakura put it on her face). &#147;I 
know Water gives you an air bubble but once it runs out the mask will 
take over and supply 10 additional minutes of air. That&#146;s it 
otherwise.&#148; (snaps Sakura in the butt as she passes) &#147;Go Ham-ham on 
their butts, Snoozy.&#148;

&#147;----&#148; (Sakura still isn&#146;t happy being called Snoozer) &#147;---sigh, Umi! 
Form a bubble of air to protect me from the water!&#148;

Nina - &#147;Remember, even if the air runs out in the bubble you&#146;ll have 
10 minutes of air from the re-breather, but that&#146;s that. Don&#146;t stay 
longer than that. If you need to chat to me (and lord knows I&#145;m mocked 
you long enough so you wouldn&#145;t feel the need to do that) I&#145;ll have my 
link gear on---&#148; (slides half circle metal headband onto the back of 
her head connected to her wetware links) &#147;--and I&#146;ll monitor your 
transmissions on my visor just in case.&#148; (the visor links into the 
metal piece).

&#147;I got it.&#148;

&#147;Well, good luck.&#148;

And, with Tomoyo recording, Sakura jumps into the water and 
disappears.

&#147;Good thing I bought these little gizmos with me---&#148; Nina giggles as 
she pulls three small pods out of her pocket and tosses them into the 
water. &#147;What are those?&#148;

&#147;Campods, Tomoyo, they&#146;ll keep a record of her adventure down there--- 
something for your second volume DVD collection. Here--&#148; (pulls out 
screen) &#147;--let&#146;s watch.&#148;

As the campods follow Sakura down the water grows darker and darker. 
Briefly Sakura seems to stop but then continues to let the bubble 
carry her down. Soon it begins to grow bright again as she nears the 
source of the disturbances.

&#147;Better freeze it--&#148; (hold up gauntlet) &#147;--just in case. Now let&#146;s 
see--&#148; (the holo-imager comes up and displays the cards, but in the 
dim light Sakura can hardly make anything out). &#147;Here it is, Swords of 
Revealing Li----ght!&#148;

Suddenly it&#146;s very bright, dry, and Tomoyo/Eliza&#146;s looking at her 
oddly. But that only lasts for a second or so. &#147;WHAT HAPPENED TO 
NINA?!?&#148; Eliza screams.

Sakura looks down at the card she selected. &#147;I didn&#146;t see this card 
before.&#148; (shows card to Eliza).

&#147;Monster Replace?!? But that means Nina-- NINA!!&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

Everything happened so fast she hardly had a chance to gulp down any 
air before the world collapsed around her, and everything went watery 
and dark. Nina&#146;s senses shut off as the water slams into her (and the 
small amount of air that traveled with her during the switch) and she 
is sent reeling from the blow. Her mind nearly blanks out as she 
struggles to regain her senses, but dimly her thoughts focus on one 
thing.

------------------------------------------------------------

---Eliza---

That&#146;s all the link would say. Over and over again it flashed just 
that.

&#147;NINA! NINA!! Respond!! NINA!!&#148; Eliza yelled, growing more and more 
frantic. Then, something new came up.

---Sakura--- don&#146;t--- I can&#146;t--- I&#146;m dying--- let go---

&#147;What?!?&#148; Sakura gasped, looking over the readout on her own link.

Tomoyo was just as confused as Sakura about this, &#147;Sakura&#146;s up here! 
What is she thinking?!&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

Nina weakly struggled against the encompassing arms, looking straight 
into Sakura&#146;s face as she began to feel her air running out. Briefly 
Nina blacked out, but regain consciousness fast only to feel herself 
weakening, slipping in and out. As she opened her eyes again, she was 
Eliza holding her, and stopped caring whether she lived or died.

------------------------------------------------------------

---don&#146;t leave me--- &#145;liza--- hold me please--- don&#146;t let me go--- 
please---

&#147;NINA NO!!&#148; Eliza screams, leaping over into the water. But as she 
hit&#146;s the water she freezes up as if she jumped into a tub with a live 
electrical cable in her hands. She screams as she hits, electricity 
shocking her hard, before she is tossed into the railing hard. Quickly 
Tomoyo rushes forward and grabs Eliza&#146;s upper body, struggling to keep 
her above water as Sakura helps to try and pull her up.

&#147;--no--- no--- Nina--- noooo---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll get her!&#148; Sakura quickly moves to jump the railing, only for a 
dark shadowy thing to fly across her line of sight and into the water. 
&#147;Yuki! He&#146;s going to---&#148; (stops, turns) &#147;---Yuki?&#148;

He was standing behind her. As he and Toya helped pull Eliza from the 
water, Sakura turns to face the lake. &#147;What was that?!&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

Nina shuts her eyes, and with the last bit of will she moves left hand 
to her right neural gauntlet and triggers the holo imager.

&#145;---summoned---s-s-skull--- merger mode--- g-g-goo---&#148;

As she holds tight the gauntlet activates, and encases her in hard 
skeletal armor, covering her face in the skull helmet and reviving her 
lungs with fresh air (generated from the bodysuit by drawing the 
oxygen out of the water and turning it into breathable air for Nina). 
Briefly stunned, she grabs tightly onto &#147;Eliza&#148; and sneers, her eyes 
visible through the helmet&#146;s eye sockets as they narrow. &#147;Bang.&#148;

With a scream she launches an electrical assault, supercharging the 
water around her as she throttles the thing she was holding (and 
herself) with a full on electrical barrage. Under the attack it 
disappears, leaving Nina to float towards the bottom of the lake 
drained and wasted, her strength gone. Worst, as the armor drew oxygen 
out of the water like a shark does, which means it only works if Nina 
moves constantly. If she stops moving the air dries out again, and she 
starts to suffocate once again.

&#147;---damn---&#148; Nina gasps, watching the light fade above her, &#147;I&#146;m 
scared--- goddess-- &#145;liza--- I&#146;m scared--- please--&#148;

As she blacks out she feels two soft feminine arms wrap around her, 
and a loving gaze of a woman&#146;s smiling face gazing into her visor as 
she&#146;s embraced by someone.

&#147;---goddess---&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

When she comes to she finds herself lying in the Medico Bay of the 
Ryoko, her clothes gone and her body mending from the experience. To 
one side she spots a familiar face. As Dr. Adri Talbot approaches her, 
Nina takes a swipe at the doctor&#146;s shoulder length dark hair and 
smiles. &#147;Knew you were more than a pretty face, doc.&#148;

&#147;Thanks. I cleared your lungs of the liquid you swallowed, and I 
treated you for shock (self induced I see) and hypothermia (that lake 
you were in was cold). What compelled you to jump in a lake like that 
anyway?&#148;

&#147;Somebody else made my mind up. Where&#146;s---?&#148;

&#147;They&#146;re waiting in the Resting Area. Here---&#148; (hands off neural 
gauntlet) &#147;--Sakura wanted you to have it back. She was really 
apologetic the whole time, couldn&#146;t stop bowing.&#148;

&#147;Well---&#148; (looks at cards in gauntlet) &#147;---it&#146;s not her fault. Now 
where&#146;s-- there it is--&#148; (holds up card) &#147;Monster Replace. Never had 
this card before.&#148; (sighs as she shoves the cards into her waterproof 
card pouch) &#147;Somebody&#146;s going to pay for that one. But--&#148; (slumps back 
abit winded just from talking) &#147;--maybe later. Where&#146;s Eliza?&#148;

&#147;Bathroom break. She&#146;s been sitting here non-stop watching you. When 
she first brought you in here she was in the grip of a panic attack, I 
had to give her a relaxant just to calm her (and at double dose no 
less!) and she still was nervous. She didn&#146;t want to leave your side 
until you were feeling better.&#148;

&#147;Poor thing. It&#146;s not her fault either. Sigh. So, who saved me?&#148;

&#147;Glavius. He was there with his wife and jumped in when he heard the 
commotion.&#148;

&#147;Nice guy. When Eliza gets back I&#146;ll--&#148; Suddenly Nina stops and looks, 
spotting Eliza to one side standing near a doorway shaking like a 
leaf. &#147;Come here--- come here---&#148; With tentative steps, then dashing 
strides, Eliza jumps into Nina&#146;s arms and holds her tight. The two hug 
until Nina&#146;s strength gives out again. As she pulls Eliza into the 
bed, both fall asleep in a soft embrace, Eliza sobbing for a few 
minutes until she also falls asleep.

&#147;At least ask me if you can double up before doing it.&#148; (rubs her head 
wearily) &#147;Better tell the others the good news.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

It takes Adri two minutes to calm everyone down to the point of them 
listening.

Inside the room was Sakura, Toya &amp; Glavius (a tall dark haired male 
wearing a comfortable looking dress uniform (for the food fair)). 
Tomoyo took Mirra-chan &amp; Hikaru home, and Yuki went home to wait for 
Toya.

&#147;She&#146;ll be fine. Got the excess water out of her and she&#146;ll make a 
quick recovery---&#148; Adri stops, notices Sakura&#146;s morbid expression, and 
smiles. &#147;She&#146;s not angry at you. She probably won&#146;t stop calling your 
Sneezer for awhile but she&#146;s rather forgiving right now.&#148;

&#147;Snoozer.&#148; Sakura corrects, still nervous and depressed.

&#147;There&#146;s something I wanted to talk to you about though, Sakura.&#148; 
(leans over to talk to her) &#147;Nina muttered something about you holding 
her down, then Eliza, then something I couldn&#146;t make out. She was too 
delirious when she was brought in to make much sense, and now that 
she&#146;s well she&#146;s too tight lipped to answer questions. Being naturally 
stubborn and all.&#148;

&#147;She saw me in the lake?&#148;

&#147;I think the card took your form, Sakura, that&#146;s the only answer.&#148; 
Kero surmises.

&#147;But why my form, and then Eliza&#146;s? And her true form is a woman, 
right?&#148;

&#147;Not really---&#148; (Glavius) &#147;I noticed some of the reports and the 
descriptions, and they match the appearance of a model Misho was using 
to promote the festival who fell into the lake and got wet.&#148;

&#147;F-fell in?&#148; (Sakura)

&#147;She&#146;s alive, well, and posting a new batch of nude pics of herself on 
her website. But obviously this thing saw her, mimicked her form---&#148;

&#147;THAT&#146;S IT!!&#148; Everyone turns to look at Kero, who was now all excited. 
&#147;It&#146;s Mimic!&#148;

&#147;Clow Reed made a card called Mimic?&#148;

&#147;Actually it was one of his earlier mistakes. Clow Reed made the card, 
but it was too stubborn and arrogant. The card thought it was better 
than everyone including Clow Reed, so he finally had to seal it away 
and replaced that card with Mirror (who was gentler and had a child 
like innocence to her personality). Clow got rid of Mimic somewhere, 
and we haven&#146;t heard about it in ages--- but is this really Mimic? 
After all these years it&#146;s been here? In a place of dreams?&#148;

&#147;Seems that way.&#148; Adri concludes, &#147;That explains the ability to take 
on other people&#146;s forms. But how do you capture a card that can mimic 
anything it sees?&#148;

&#147;Good question.&#148; Sakura mutters as she slumps her shoulders, the 
events of the night finally weighting down on her and wearing her out.

Toya finally decides to take Sakura home, putting her in Tomoyo&#146;s care 
as he leaves the mansion.

As Tomoyo walks next to one of her bodyguards, watching Sakura&#146;s face 
as she sleeps, she smiles abit and thinks to herself &#145;She does sorta 
look like Snoozer when she&#146;s sleeping. How cute!&#146;

------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;Ever think about giving Sakura a break?&#148; Adri asks as she oversees 
Nina&#146;s transfer back planetside (for her to complete her resting at 
the Daidouji residence), walking aside her hover stretcher as they 
head down to the Teleporter-room. &#147;Why? Your not going to mother hen 
her too, are you?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not that, Nina, I just think you should ease off her back abit. 
That&#146;s all.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll forgive the near drowning thing, alright? Just don&#146;t take away 
my ability to call her &#145;Snoozer&#146;. It&#146;s one of the few joys I have in 
life that isn&#146;t sex related.&#148;

&#147;But she&#146;s so cute! Can&#146;t you stop teasing her like you do?&#148;

&#147;Look, Adri, I&#146;m the ONLY one who screws with her mind. Anyone teases 
her gets a fist in the face from me, anyone messes with her gets a 
spanking from me, anyone violates her gets the &#147;Full Monty&#148; (Winterian 
Style) from me. That might be hunky-dorry for sick fan porn, but in my 
world, on MY watch, it&#146;s not kosher. Got it?&#148;

&#147;Sure. She&#146;s not my type anyway---&#148; (blinks) &#147;---your not having wet 
dreams about her---&#148;

&#147;Want me to give you a rectal exam with your pocket light stick?&#148;

&#147;---I&#146;ll take that as a no---&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

Nina lays back, and flips the page. &#147;Finally found time to catch up on 
my reading.&#148; (sighs) &#147;Should take more time off whenever possible. 
Hmm---&#148; (smirks) &#147;---maybe I should put a request through Command to 
post a request for Ryoko (Real Bout High School) hentai pics. I got my 
rank, I&#146;m due it.&#148; (hears a knock at the door) &#147;Enter.&#148; (looks over to 
the door) &#147;Hey, Tomoyo.&#148;

Tomoyo, wearing a beautiful dress, enters with Eliza&#146;s pouch slung 
over her shoulder. &#147;How are you doing?&#148; (Nina shrugs) &#147;I&#146;m doing fine, 
but I&#146;m guessing that&#146;s a tribute to me since it&#146;s Eliza&#146;s pouch and 
she wouldn&#146;t give that up unless it&#146;s to bring me something. How&#146;s 
Sakura? She does know I&#146;m not going to blow up at her or anything--- 
she could grace me with a visit once she gets over the fear of me 
trying to kill her while she&#146;s at it.&#148;

&#147;I can come in?&#148; (the meek little voice outside the door asked)

&#147;Yeah, Sakura, come in.&#148;

&#147;Sorry.&#148; (Sakura, head bowed, walks in blushing) &#147;Cut that out, 
Sakura, I&#146;m fine. Come over here and sit down. If there&#146;s edible 
treats in there let&#146;s share. (I have my dust buster so I&#146;m good to 
clean the sheets of crumbs after we eat)---&#148; (blinks) &#147;---is the bag 
moving?&#148; (pokes open the pouch and pulls Kero out, smiling) &#147;Nice. 
You&#146;re here too.&#148; (rubs him on the head) &#147;Your not all sad too, are 
you?&#148; (puts Kero on the bed) &#147;When I&#146;m 100% again I&#146;ll be back to 
being the same ole&#146; bitchy me I can be, so don&#146;t get used to me being 
smirky all the time.&#148; (sighs) &#147;But that&#146;s later. So--- whatcha bring 
me?&#148;

&#147;Cookies. Sorry. Eliza got you a book too.&#148;

&#147;She knows what I read. And thanks, you know I just love your cookies. 
Though your REAL sweet spot is only for Sakura&#146;s tongue---&#148; (blinks) 
&#147;---and the mere fact that Sakura didn&#146;t even flinch, let alone try to 
hit me is a bad sign.&#148; (shakes Sakura with one hand, smling as she 
does) &#147;Come on! This isn&#146;t my wake! Stop pouting and get over it! What 
happened happened, and it&#146;s nobody&#146;s fault! Here---&#148; (pulls out card) 
&#147;You triggered this card. It&#146;s a card I don&#146;t even own, yet somehow it 
got into my gauntlet.&#148;

&#147;H-how?&#148; Sakura asks meekly.

&#147;I&#146;ll find out one day, but not today---&#148; (smiles) &#147;---today is COOKIE 
DAY! Let&#146;s eat.&#148; (opens bag and hands out cookies) &#147;Man I love a good 
cookie rush! Somebody go over to my replicator I put on the cabinet 
and make us some chocolate milk. Goes great with cookies.&#148;

As Tomoyo (who already knew how to make the device work) did that, 
Sakura talked to Nina.

&#147;Did you get in trouble?&#148;

&#147;Nah. It went right under the radar (like I went under sea level). 
Nobody at Command heard about it and that&#146;s OK in my book. Mina 00 
even covered my stay on the Ryoko and no report was ever filed about 
it by either Adri or Mina 00, and that&#146;s double OK in my book.&#148; (holds 
up cookie &amp; milk) &#147;And I get to wolf down cookies &amp; chocolate milk in 
bed! Triple OK in my book!&#148;

&#147;We figured out what card it was down there. Mimic.&#148;

&#147;So that explains why it changed form---&#148; (tags Sakura on the cheek) 
&#147;---should make your sex life far more interesting when you catch it 
you goddess, you!&#148;

&#147;---aren&#146;t you angry?&#148;

Nina leans back and thinks, &#147;Not really. It&#146;s not like it was done on 
purpose or anything so I have no reason to be pissy about it. Besides 
which, for the life of me all I can think about is how Eliza almost 
killed herself trying to save me and that was---&#148; (smiles) &#147;I don&#146;t 
want to be angry this time, because it just reminds me how I almost 
lost Eliza and that makes me somber when I think about it.&#148; (shakes 
off thoughts) &#147;So let&#146;s not think about it! Now how are you going to 
catch this ---?!?&#148; (Sakura grabs Nina and gives her a noogie) &#147;YOU&#146;RE 
THE GREATEST, NINA!!&#148;

&#147;NOW I&#146;M ANGRY!! STOP IT!! STOP IT!! TAKE YOU DYSFUNCTIONAL OUT ON 
SOMEONE ELSE, I&#146;M SICK AND BEDRIDDEN!! STOP THAT!!&#148; (Nina finally 
pushes Sakura away and huffs at her) &#145;Damn! Now, back to capturing the 
card---&#148;

&#147;Who saved you?&#148; Eliza asked, tossing a data pad onto the bed. On the 
bed was an image from Nina&#146;s wetware (from her mind) showing a gentle 
female face holding her. Nina blinks, then shudders at the image. &#147;So 
I wasn&#146;t hallucinating. Are you angry at me, Eliza?&#148;

&#147;No. I just want to know.&#148;

&#147;---I think it might be--&#148; (stops) &#147;--I can&#146;t say.&#148;

&#147;Why not?&#148;

&#147;--it hurts too much to say--&#148; (pulls Eliza close and leans her head 
on the blonde&#146;s shoulder) &#147;Please don&#146;t ask me about it. Not now. I&#146;ll 
explain later but--&#148; (sighs) &#147;--not now.&#148;

&#147;Alright.&#148;

The rest of the conversation is spent talking about less stressful 
things.

------------------------------------------------------------

That night.

&#147;I should be getting used to this--&#148; Nina sighs, feeling her strength 
returning as she takes another deep breath of the night air. &#147;But here 
we go again, Round 2.&#148; Nina clicks on her commlink headgear and 
motions to the others (wearing similar devices). &#147;These headset comms 
I had Mina send down should do the trick in keeping us linked.&#148;

As they all neared the lake the water began to churn, then whirl about 
until it explodes, as a figure rises out of it. At this everyone stops 
and stares in disbelief.

&#147;It&#146;s Nina?!?&#148; Sakura spits out.

Sure enough, floating over the lake (wearing one of Nina&#146;s neural 
gauntlets) is Mimic, in Nina&#146;s form. It stares at Sakura with a mix of 
contempt and hatred. From it&#146;s jacket it draws cards and slides them 
into the gauntlet (five in total). &#147;Duel me.&#148;

&#147;---pheeew?&#148;

&#147;Duel me.&#148; the card repeats.

&#147;The card wants Sakura to duel it?&#148; Tomoyo whispers, camera focused on 
the action.

&#147;It wants Sakura to duel it using mimics of Duel Monster cards as her 
weapons. She&#145;s probably using a water deck, but neither myself nor 
Eliza carries one.&#148; Nina whispers back, staring at Mimic.

Suddenly the ground shakes and from the water a platform rises out. &#147;I 
am not without resources, or allies who remember me when I was still 
amongst Clow Reed&#146;s favorite cards.&#148; Mimic announces as if listening 
in on the conversation.

&#147;What is that?&#148;

&#147;It looks like something from the Create card, but how---&#148; (Mimic 
holds the Create book up for everyone to see) &#147;Oh. It&#145;s writing it&#145;s 
own rules I see.&#148;

&#147;Flippant as always Kerberos. But your smug superior attitude won&#145;t 
save your pet Captor now.&#148;

Nina glances over at Sakura nervously, &#147;Sakura, you don&#146;t have enough 
cards to duel it! Let me!!&#148;

&#147;NO! I can do it! Mimic? I&#146;ll duel you!&#148; Sakura screams, drawing her 
cards and powering her rings. &#147;And if I win then your sealed!&#148;

&#147;Agreed. Let&#146;s start.&#148;

&#147;Sakura!&#148; Tomoyo calls out, pulling her rings off and tossing them to 
her, &#147;Here! Use these!&#148;

&#147;Thanks Tomo-chan!&#148; (grabs the rings out of the air and puts them on.

Sakura - 4000LP (n/a) Mimic (Nina) - 4000LP (Umi)

&#147;I&#146;ll start this off---&#148; Mimic whispers, drawing five cards and 
placing them in her gauntlet. &#147;I&#146;ll go eaay on you. I&#146;ll play Flame 
Manipulator in Attack Mode.&#148;

From the platform, a wild male with a fiery aura rises from the 
ground.

Flame Manipulator (Fire/Spellcaster)

Attack - 0900 Defense 1000

&#147;OH PLEASE!!&#148; Nina laughs, &#147;That&#146;s a pushover! Smoke it, Sakura!!&#148;

&#147;Right---&#148; (holds Umi&#146;s ring out at creature) &#147;--Umi! Water lance!!&#148;

As the ring launches it&#146;s attack, Mimic simply stares and watches with 
no interest, it&#146;s creature quickly falling before Sakura&#146;s attack 
without much effort on her part.

Sakura - 4000LP (n/a) Mimic (Nina) - 2700LP (Umi)

&#147;YEAH SAKURA! THAT&#146;S IT!!&#148; (Kero is cheering) &#147;WIPE IT OUT!!&#148;

&#147;Humph.&#148; (draws a new card) &#147;That&#146;s another bad trait of yours, 
Kerberos, you always jump to conclusions before you know what&#146;s going 
on.&#148; (thinks it over) &#147;First I&#146;ll play Dragon Zombie in Attack 
Mode---&#147; (disgusting foul dead beast rises from the platform, giving 
Sakura the shakes as she stares at it)

Dragon Zombie (Dark/Zombie)

Attack - 1600 Defense - 0000

&#147;Then I&#146;ll play Card Destruction and wipe out our hands--- but since 
you don&#146;t have a hand to wipe out I&#146;ll just discard this hand and draw 
new cards.&#148; (draws a fresh set of cards) &#147;Now I&#146;m ready.&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan! You can do it! Destroy that card!&#148;

&#147;R-r-right---&#148; (gulps) &#147;--Umi? ATTACK!!&#148;

Again another water lance destroys the monster on the field.

Sakura - 4000LP (n/a) Mimic - 2100LP (Umi)

&#147;Oh, well---&#148; (draws a new card)

&#147;Not so tough now, aintcha!&#148; Kero snickers.

&#147;My ability to win hasn&#146;t diminished because of the &#145;death&#146; of a few 
cards.&#148;

&#147;A few?!? Sakura&#146;s wiping the floor with you!&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ll see about that---&#148; (smiles) &#147;--I&#146;ll play Reborn the Monster and 
bring back a card I discarded with Card Destruction--- THE DARK 
MAGICIAN!!&#148;

&#147;NO!!&#148;

As Nina&#146;s breath stops she watches as the Dark Magician rises from the 
ground, and takes it&#146;s place. &#147;And I&#146;ll play two cards face down.&#148; 
(clicks them on gauntlet)

Dark Magician

Dark/Spellcaster

Attack - 2500 Defense - 2100

&#147;I&#146;ll still take it on!&#148;

&#147;Bad move, little Card Captor. Dark Magician--- DARK MAGIC ATTACK!!&#148;

&#147;Umi, WATER SHIELD!!&#148;

&#147;SAKURA NO!!&#148; Nina screams but too late, as the attack envelops the 
shield and knocks Sakura backwards onto her back.

&#147;SAKURA-CHAN!!&#148; (Before Sakura knows it Tomoyo is upon her, shaking 
like a leaf and scared, all thoughts of recording gone in the rush of 
fear and panic drawn all over her face).

Sakura - 3700LP (n/a) Mimic - 2100LP (Umi)

&#147;Think I&#146;m still a loser, Kerberos?&#148; Mimic taunts.
