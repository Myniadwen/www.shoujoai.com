<h1>Sakura Lemon (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaitouace.html">KaitouAce</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/saklem-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>     Sakura tossed in a restless sleep.  Her mind filled with the
images of her experience with Tomoyo.  Her body shivered as she
remembered Tomoyo&#39;s every movement.  The feelings pleased her but
there were other problems.  Sakura loved her friend more than
anything else.  She couldn&#39;t bear the thought of being separated
from her.  But Sakura was ashamed.  Ashamed of her feelings, both
physical and non-physical.  Not only did being touched in her
private spots frighten her but she knew that that type of
behavior wasn&#39;t accepted by most people.  She dreaded the idea of
anyone finding out.  She didn&#39;t want to be hated by anyone.  Her
family might shun her.  Lee, Mei Lin, and her classmates would
reject her.  Kero-chan might even consider her unfit to be a Card
Captor.  And then there was Yukito.  All her hopes and dreams of
being with him would be shattered.  The image of his disapproving
drove her to jerk harshly, shutting her eyes so tightly they
burned.  But besides all this, there was the other problem.  The
feelings that began as soon as she left Tomoyo&#39;s that evening.
The feelings that could be described by no other word than lust.
The experience that Tomoyo gave her was like no other.  As much
as she hated to admit it, she longed for Tomoyo&#39;s soft lips on
her neck, her gentle fingers caressing her.  But those thoughts
were wrong.  She knew that.  But her mind wouldn&#39;t let her forget
those feelings.  Everything else paled in comparison.  She
remembered how she relented after Tomoyo had made her orgasm.
How she licked Tomoyo&#39;s finger wanting more.  How she wrapped her
arms around Tomoyo, holding her into their kiss.  Sakura still
longed for more.  Could something that felt so good really be
that bad?  But all that mattered was that it was.  Sakura huddled
herself into a fetal position, trying to forget.  But the motion
of bunching herself up caused her body to involuntarily caress
itself in a number of places.  Sakura moaned inwardly as her
thoughts went back to Tomoyo.  She needed her so badly.  She had
to experience those feelings again.  But how could she?  Without
Tomoyo . . . Without realizing it, she slowly slid her own hand
into her pajamas.  She felt her underwear and slid her finger
across them noticing the already present dampness.  She rubbed
herself with increasing speed, starting to squirm at the touch.
But even as she was enjoying herself, a voice spoke to her in her
head.
     &quot;Don&#39;t do this.  It&#39;s wrong.&quot;
     But Sakura&#39;s lust answered back.
     &quot;But it feels good.  It can&#39;t be bad.&quot;
     &quot;But it is.  You need to stop.&quot;
     &quot;I CAN&#39;T!  I need it.&quot;
     &quot;No.  You just want it and not everything you want is good
for you.&quot;
     But Sakura wouldn&#39;t listen.  She remembered how Tomoyo had
made her orgasm.  It was that final explosion she craved.  She
maneuvered her hand inside her panties and started to put a
finger inside herself.
     &quot;Sakura, no!  What will your family think?  What if you get
caught?&quot;
     &quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot;
     Sakura plunged her finger into herself and froze . . . but
nothing happened.  It wasn&#39;t enough.  Not anymore.
     &quot;See.  You can&#39;t even do it.  Your body knows it&#39;s wrong.
Stop now.&quot;
     &quot;No.&quot;
     Sakura stuck a second finger inside herself.  She arched her
back as a wave of pleasure jolted through her . . . but it STILL
wasn&#39;t the same.  It still wasn&#39;t enough.  Sakura began thrusting
her fingers in and out of herself, determined to find what she
had lost.  After what seemed like an eternity, Sakura made a
discovery.  There was a point inside her she couldn&#39;t reach.
There was something blocking the way.  She pushed it slightly and
it bent a little.  She smiled to herself and began to push when
her mind screamed at her, realizing her intention.
     &quot;SAKURA!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!&quot;
     &quot;This HAS to be it.  It&#39;s in the way.&quot;
     &quot;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing!  It could be important!
Don&#39;t break it!&quot;
     &quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot;
     Sakura braced herself for the inevitable orgasm and pushed
as hard as she could.
     &quot;NO!!!&quot;
     &quot;YESSS!!!&quot;
     And then the barrier tore.  And for Sakura, there was
nothing but pain.  Her piercing scream shot through the house,
shaking it to its foundation.  Kero-chan immediately woke and saw
Sakura convulsing in pain.  He flew to her side in panic.
     &quot;Sakura!  What&#39;s wrong?!  What is it?!&quot;
     Sakura could only cry.  All she could see were tears and all
she could hear and feel was the pain.  Suddenly, Touya burst
through the door.  Kero-chan immediately fell into his stuffed
animal mode as Touya ran to Sakura&#39;s side.
     &quot;Sakura!  What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
     She didn&#39;t answer.  She just cringed as she pulled away from
him.
     &quot;SAKURA!  Answer me!&quot;
     &quot; . . . It hurts . . . &quot;
     &quot;What hurts?  Sakura!&quot;
     &quot;Oniichan . . . It hurts . . . &quot;
     &quot;Let me see.  Show me.&quot;
     Sakura began to roll over but then stopped as she realized
what would happen.  Touya would find out.  Then he&#39;d tell
everyone.  She&#39;d be cast out.  Hated.
     &quot; . . . No.&quot;
     Touya didn&#39;t understand what was going on but had to find
out the problem.  He turned Sakura over, facing him.  He couldn&#39;t
see her face but noticed her arms beneath the covers.
     &quot;No.  Oniichan, please.  Go away.&quot;
     Sakura tried to stop Touya but couldn&#39;t as as he lifted the
covers off her body.  Touya was caught completely off guard by
what he saw.  Sakura&#39;s hand was thrust into her pajamas.  There
was moisture all over the front.  Mixed with it were spots of red
which Touya concluded must be blood.  Touya immediately realized
what happened.  Sakura was terrified.  She desperately pleaded
with Touya.
     &quot;Please don&#39;t tell anyone!  I&#39;ll do anything you want!  I&#39;ll
do all your chores!  I&#39;ll . . . &quot;
     &quot;Sakura.&quot;
     &quot;NO!  Don&#39;t . . . &quot;
     She tried to move but the pain once again seared through
her.  She clutched Touya as he caught her rigid body.  He held
her softly as he spoke.
     &quot;Don&#39;t worry.  I won&#39;t tell anyone.  But you have to let me
see.  You need to move your hand.&quot;
     &quot;I can&#39;t.  It hurts.&quot;
     &quot;I know.  But you have to.  You can hold onto me if you need
to.&quot;
     Sakura nodded and held Touya&#39;s shoulder with her free hand.
They both stared at her other hand still deep inside her.  Touya
slowly grabbed Sakura&#39;s wrist and looked at her concerned.
     &quot;Are you ready?&quot;
     Sakura nodded again and braced herself.  Touya slowly pulled
at her hand.  Sakura shook in pain and told him to stop.
     &quot;Sakura.  We have to . . . &quot;
     &quot;I know.  Just....do it quick, OK?&quot;
     Touya wasn&#39;t sure if that was the best plan but agreed.  He
looked at her to make sure she was ok, then pulled quickly.
Sakura yelled in pain as her fingers were forcefully released
from her body.  She dug her fingers into Touya&#39;s shoulder,
causing him to wince.  But as her fingers came free, she was
caught off guard as out of nowhere, the feeling she was
originally looking for came to her.  She shivered in front of
Touya as the pressure built, then exploded.
     &quot;Oh . . . oh . . . ONIICHAN!!!!&quot;
     She dove into Touya&#39;s chest, grasping him with her now
blood-covered hand.  The strain was too much for poor Sakura.
Her body seemed to tear itself apart.  Pain and pleasure were now
on equal footing.  She became dizzy and blacked out.  As she lost
consciousness, her last thought frightened her.
     &quot;Tomoyo-chan . . . how could you do this to me?&quot;

     Tomoyo woke up that morning feeling better than she had her
entire life.  She was unsure about yesterday&#39;s events before but
had arisen with a new feeling of assurance and security.  She
gleefully prepared for school, ready to experience her new
friendship with Sakura.  Her mind raced with thoughts of the
evening before and how it would affect their daily relationship.
She was so oblivious to her surroundings that when she finally
calmed down, she was in the hallways of Tomoeda Elementary
heading for her homeroom.  As she walked the familiar steps, she
reminisced about the many months before and her growing feelings
for Sakura.  How after months of helping Sakura and studying her
videos, her eyes slowly focused from the costume to the girl
beneath the costume.  How she caught herself spending minutes
just staring at the girl&#39;s face and how those minutes became
hours.  Soon she noticed the thin arms and smooth legs.  Costumes
became a little more revealing now and then.  She&#39;d film her in
delight, then hurry home to watch.  She remembered the day she
felt the now familiar feelings through her body and the day she
realized the battle videos weren&#39;t enough.  She began inviting
her to her home to try new outfits.  She had hidden cameras to
capture the girl&#39;s beauty indefinitely.  And capture it it did.
Now the leaping and swinging of batons were replaced with the
sliding of cloth and the exposure of skin.  Even as much as the
girl&#39;s underwear at times.  Then one day it happened.  The
revealing of the girl&#39;s bare chest.  She had seen it before but
now it was different.  Her new feelings combined with the pure
voyeurism of the situation made her feel strange.  And she
remembered the moment she went to investigate the sensations,
bringing her to discover the greatest joy of her young life.
Just the thought of her first time made Tomoyo excited.  She felt
herself slightly through her school skirt and gasped.  Realizing
what she was doing, she stopped for a moment then giggled to
herself.  After composing herself, she bounded up to the door of
her homeroom.  She swung open the door but no one was there.  She
was a bit surprised as Sakura usually got to class a little
earlier than her.
     &quot;Hmmm....I guess she&#39;s a little late.&quot;
     Tomoyo sat around for a few minutes but Sakura failed to
appear.  After a little while, students began to slowly filter
in, including Rika, Naoko, and the others.  Tomoyo went up to
them.
     &quot;Have you seen Sakura-chan this morning?&quot;
     All she asked responded the same, not having seen her
anywhere.  Class started as normal and the teacher appeared and
took roll.  When Sakura&#39;s voice didn&#39;t follow her name, the class
was asked where she was.  Everyone assumed she was absent that
day.  Tomoyo answered that she had seen her yesterday and seemed
fine.  The teacher shrugged and continued with roll call.  Tomoyo
blushed a little as memories of yesterday once again came back.
She quickly shook the images out of her mind and focused on
class.  During lunch, Tomoyo sat in the usual place where she and
Sakura ate.  She was just finishing when she heard a voice from
afar.
     &quot;Hey....Tomoyo-chan.&quot;
     She was surprised to see Touya outside the fence with
Yukito.  She greeted them warmly but Touya became somewhat
serious.
     &quot;Would you mind checking up on Sakura after school?&quot;
     &quot;Huh?  What&#39;s wrong?  Is she sick?&quot;
     Touya needed to pick his words carefully.  He promised not
to tell anyone but knew Sakura should discuss this with her best
friend.  He could only do so much.  He couldn&#39;t let Yukito know,
either.
     &quot;Well, she hurt herself last night.  She&#39;s ok.  I was just
wondering if you could go see her.&quot;
     Tomoyo was just happy she knew where Sakura was.  She beamed
happily.  &quot;Of course I&#39;ll go.&quot;
     &quot;Ok.  I&#39;ll meet you here after school.  We can go on my
bike.  Is that ok?&quot;
     &quot;Ummm . . . sure.&quot;
     With that, Touya and Yukito left.  Tomoyo was relieved but
wondered why Touya would want her to get there so quickly.
Surely she couldn&#39;t have hurt herself that badly.  Maybe she
tripped and hurt herself on the way home from her house.  Once
again, Tomoyo&#39;s thoughts were a little dirty as she waited for
school to end.

     After school, Touya brought Tomoyo to the house as promised.
Tomoyo was met at the door by Sakura&#39;s father, who was on his way
to the university.
     &quot;Hello Tomoyo-chan.  Sorry I can&#39;t stay but I have to get
back to work.  I&#39;ve been real busy lately.  I wasn&#39;t even here
when Sakura hurt herself.&quot;
     &quot;Really?&quot;
     &quot;I rushed home that night to check on her.  Fortunately it
wasn&#39;t too serious.  But I have to go back and catch up on some
unfinished business.  Please help yourself to anything.  Touya
should be able to show you before he heads to work.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you.&quot;
     Tomoyo gracefully bowed and he headed off.  Touya brought
Tomoyo into the house and gave her some cake and juice before
heading upstairs to change.  As he was leaving, he peeked into
Sakura&#39;s room.  The lights were out as all he could see of Sakura
was a lump under the covers.  He whispered to her.
     &quot;Sakura, you have a visitor.&quot;
     Sakura slowly shook and uttered a noise which Touya took as
approval.
     &quot;Try to cheer up Sakura.  You&#39;re no good like this.&quot;
     Once again Sakura moaned, just enough to acknowledge Touya&#39;s
existence.  Touya tried something else.
     &quot;*SIGH*  What good is teasing a monster who won&#39;t fight
back?&quot;
     There was a sharp silence and Touya wondered if he said the
wrong thing.  Suddenly he was hit with a pillow.  Through the
fluffy cotton he heard Sakura muttering.  &quot; . . . I am NOT a
monster . . . &quot;
     Touya just smiled at the remnants of the old Sakura showing
herself.
     &quot;Well, I&#39;m outta here.  I&#39;ll send Tomoyo-chan up in a sec.&quot;
     Touya closed the door and headed downstairs. Upon hearing
that name, Sakura&#39;s blood ran cold.  That was the last person she
wanted to see right now.  She knew she&#39;d have to face her, but
she wasn&#39;t ready.  She fidgeted nervously as she thought of what
she would say.  Suddenly, a soft voice pierced Sakura&#39;s ears as
she tried to shut her out.
     &quot;Sakura-chan?&quot;
     [&quot;Oh no . . . &quot;]
     &quot;Sakura-chan?  Are you awake?&quot;
     Sakura meekly answered her.
     &quot;Tomoyo-chan.&quot;
     &quot;I heard you hurt yourself.  Are you ok?&quot;
     &quot; . . . Just sore.&quot;
     &quot;Where is it?&quot;
     Sakura quickly changed the subject, calling for Kero-chan,
but there was no answer.  Tomoyo spoke up.
     &quot;I haven&#39;t seen him.  He must have left.&quot;
     Sakura&#39;s heart sank once again, realizing there was no way
to avoid this conversation.  She suddenly jumped as Tomoyo sat
next to her on the bed.  They both sat quietly for a while until
Tomoyo uttered words that made Sakura freeze.
     &quot;You know, I&#39;ve been thinking about you all day.&quot;
     Sakura said nothing as Tomoyo continued.
     &quot;I . . . I just can&#39;t forget yesterday.  I haven&#39;t been able
to think about anything else.  The way you made me feel was
so . . . &quot;
     Tomoyo trailed off leaving Sakura puzzled until she felt
Tomoyo&#39;s warm breath on the back of her neck.  She whispered
Sakura&#39;s name and lightly kissed her.  Sakura did NOT want this
now.  Of that she was sure.  Just the thought of it made her
nauseated.  However, in her condition she could only offer weak
resistance.  She mumbled weakly.
     &quot;Tomoyo-chan . . . I can&#39;t . . . &quot;
     Tomoyo smiled at her friend.
     &quot;It&#39;s ok.  Everyone&#39;s gone.  I&#39;ll help you forget your
pain.&quot;
     Sakura squirmed in protest as Tomoyo&#39;s hand felt her through
the covers.  As much as she wanted her to stop, no words would
leave her mouth as Tomoyo&#39;s hand slid under the sheets and slowly
rubbed her thigh through her pajamas.  Sakura shut her eyes as
she felt something build inside her.  She wasn&#39;t sure what it
was, but the closer Tomoyo got to her private area, the more she
felt it.  Sakura struggled harder to free herself as Tomoyo&#39;s
hand slid up her inner thigh.  Then suddenly her hand was firmly
against Sakura&#39;s crotch . . . and Sakura exploded.
     &quot;LEAVE ME ALONE!!&quot;
     Tomoyo jumped hearing Sakura&#39;s tone of voice.  Her body
tensed in fear, causing her to tightly grasp Sakura&#39;s crotch.
Sakura&#39;s eyes shot open as the pain returned full force.  She
yelled as she retreated from Tomoyo sharply, protecting herself.
Tomoyo rose from the bed in shock.  She looked at Sakura
terrified.
     &quot;I&#39;m sorry!  I didn&#39;t mean to . . . &quot;
     Her voice trailed off as she noticed her right hand was a
little damp.  She looked at it and saw small, thin areas of light
red along with the usual fluid.  Tomoyo gasped as she slowly
realized what Sakura&#39;s problem was.
     &quot;Sakura-chan!  Is this it?  How did this happen?!  It wasn&#39;t
because of . . . &quot;
     &quot;Get out.&quot;
     Tomoyo couldn&#39;t believe what she had just heard.  She
approached Sakura slowly.
     &quot;Sakura-chan?&quot;
     &quot;Get . . . out.&quot;
     Tomoyo began pleading with Sakura.
     &quot;I didn&#39;t know this would happen!  I was only trying to...&quot;
     Sakura didn&#39;t want to hear anymore.
     &quot;Shut up!  This is all your fault!  I hurt so much I can&#39;t
even move!  And you STILL tried to touch me!  Even after I said
not to!&quot;
     Tomoyo started to break into tears.
     &quot;Sakura-chan . . . I . . . &quot;
     &quot;Get OUT!  I never want to talk to you AGAIN!!&quot;
     Those words shook Tomoyo to her core.  She felt her body
become hollow and her heart explode into a million pieces.  She
would do anything to stop this feeling but it was too late.  She
had gone too far.
     &quot; . . . I&#39;M SORRY!&quot;
     With that, Tomoyo ran out of Sakura&#39;s life forever.
