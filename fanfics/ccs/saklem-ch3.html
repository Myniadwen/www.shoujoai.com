<h1>Sakura Lemon (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaitouace.html">KaitouAce</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/saklem-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>     Tomoyo muttered pathetically as she lay in her bed.  She had
destroyed the most important thing she could ever have: her
friendship with Sakura.  Everything was a haze to Tomoyo, her
vision clouded by pain and tears.  Her head pounded, her heart
ached . . . it was as if Sakura&#39;s rejection had made her
physically ill.  All she could hear was Sakura&#39;s anger-filled
voice.  And the more she heard it, the sicker she became.  All
she wanted was for the anguish to end.  Sadly, she could only
come to one conclusion.  There was only one definite way to stop
the pain.  The very idea terrified her but Sakura&#39;s coldness was
worse.  She stood up, tears pouring down her face, and prepared
for the end.  But as she reached the door, something stopped her.
As much as she knew she didn&#39;t deserve it, she couldn&#39;t bear to
leave this world without seeing Sakura&#39;s smile once more.  And as
she thought about Sakura, she couldn&#39;t help but remember their
last, fabulous evening together.  She desperately shook the image
out of her mind.  She wouldn&#39;t do that.  She had no right.  Not
after what she did to Sakura.  But her body was in too much need.
She couldn&#39;t resist the urge of one final moment of ecstasy.
Tomoyo slowly turned toward her viewing room, disgusted with
herself for not being able to give Sakura the respect she
deserved.  As she headed inside she slowly began to disrobe.  She
took a final breath and began to descend the slope of the
theater-like room.  To her, it felt as if she was entering her
own Dante&#39;s Inferno with the trail of clothes the only symbol of
her existence and her only lifeline from eternal damnation.


     Sakura sat in her room silently.  She couldn&#39;t believe what
she had done.  Tomoyo was gone.  But it had to be.  Tomoyo had
hurt her in a way no one had ever hurt her before.  She deserved
it.  But that didn&#39;t make it any less painful.  She felt her eyes
well up again as she fell deeper into sadness.
     &quot;Sakura.&quot;
     Sakura jumped when she heard her name.  She turned, trying
to wipe the tears out of her eyes.
     &quot;Sakura, are you all right?&quot;
     She was surprised to see Kero-chan hovering in front of her
with a look of concern on his face.  Sakura quickly tried to come
up with a story to hide her shame.
     &quot;Oh!  Kero-chan!  I&#39;m fine!  Just . . . something in my
eyes.&quot;
     Kero-chan sighed and stared at her intently.
     &quot;No need to lie Sakura.  I know what happened.  I was there,
remember?&quot;
     Sakura gasped as she barely recalled when Kero-chan flew to
her that night before Touya came in.  It didn&#39;t occur to her that
he had overheard the whole thing.  Sakura started to cry again.
     &quot;Kero-chan, I&#39;m sorry!  I didn&#39;t mean to do it!  I . . . &quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s ok, Sakura.  Don&#39;t apologize.   But I did see Tomoyo
run out of here.  She looked really upset.  What happened?&quot;
     Sakura stuttered, unsure of what to say.  But her silence
confirmed Kero-chan&#39;s suspicions.  &quot; . . . It was her, wasn&#39;t
it?&quot;
     Sakura&#39;s mouth was agape as her shameful secret was
revealed.  She desperately tried to defend herself.
     &quot;It wasn&#39;t me!  It was Tomoyo-chan who did this to me!  I
can&#39;t help it anymore!  Please let me stay a Card Captor!&quot;
     Kero-chan became more than a little agitated at Sakura&#39;s
words.
     &quot;Be quiet, Sakura!&quot;
     Sakura was shocked at Kero-chan&#39;s tone and prepared herself
for the worst.
     &quot;You are and will always be a Card Captor.  Nothing can
change your destiny.  Your personal feelings and affiliations are
irrelevant.  If you weren&#39;t worthy, you wouldn&#39;t have been able
to open the book.  But what MIGHT change you is if you continue
to blame your friend for your mistake.&quot;
     Sakura sat quietly, absorbing Kero-chan&#39;s words.  Surely
that wasn&#39; t right.  All that pain she went through, all that
suffering . . . Tomoyo was the cause.  She was the one who made
her feel . . . Sakura froze.  As strange a situation as this was,
all Tomoyo did was make her feel good.  Really good.  The pain
came later . . . when Sakura tried to do things herself.  But
Sakura was still confused.
     &quot;It was Tomoyo-chan who made me feel like this.  I couldn&#39;t
stop myself . . . myself?&quot;
     The word shook her completely.  Myself.  She couldn&#39;t
control HERSELF.  Tomoyo wasn&#39;t to blame for that.  And she
didn&#39;t know Sakura had hurt herself so the later pain wasn&#39;t
really her fault either.  She should  have just told Tomoyo
outright.  Then she would have understood.  Tomoyo was just
trying to help.  She began to feel relieved when her harsh words
came to mind.  Sakura visibly jumped as she realized what she
had done.
     &quot;Oh no!  Kero-chan, I&#39;ve done a horrible thing!  What do I
do?!&quot;
     Sakura became frantic at the thought of not being friends
with Tomoyo anymore.  Once again, Kero-chan provided a simple
answer.
     &quot;Apologize.&quot;
     &quot;But . . . but how?  After what I said . . . &quot;
     Kero-chan thought a bit, then came up with a way.  The only
way really, given the situation.  He blushed slightly as he said
it.
     &quot; . . . Anyway you have to.&quot;
     Sakura realized what Kero-chan was suggesting and it
embarrassed her.  She questioned her friend.
     &quot;Is--is that ok?&quot;
     &quot;Only you know the answer to that.&quot;
     Sakura slowly smiled and jumped from the bed.  She quickly
dressed and raced out of the house, determined to save her
friendship in any way possible.


     &quot;Tomoyo-chan . . . please.&quot;
     &quot;Eh?  Please what, Sakura-chan?&quot;
     &quot;Please . . . touch me.&quot;
     Tomoyo sat back in a seat, completely nude rubbing herself
frantically while staring at the screen.
     One day.
     It had only been one day ago when they were
inseparable.  Now they were through and all Tomoyo had were
videos.  Tomoyo moaned as she orgasmed once again, the seat&#39;s
cushion now completely soaked.  Small drips occasionally fell
from the oversaturated fabric to the floor.  She had come more
times in the past hour than she had her entire young life.  Her
virgin lips were swollen and red.  Every time she touched herself,
she caused herself pain.  But she didn&#39;t care.  Her suffering
paled in comparison to what Sakura must have felt.  Any pain was
well deserved.  She cried desperately to the screen.
     &quot;Oh Sakura-chan!  What did I do?!  Please tell me!!!&quot;
     But all that replied was just more evidence of her guilt as
she sank back in her seat, gingerly touching herself once again.

     After being let in, Sakura rushed upstairs to Tomoyo&#39;s room.
Her mind was agonizing over what to say and do.  Should she just
apologize?  What if Tomoyo didn&#39;t accept?  And what about
Kero-chan&#39;s suggestion?  Should she actually go through with
that?  Fortunately for Sakura, she stopped thinking long enough
to avoid running into Tomoyo&#39;s door.  She knocked but found the
door already open.  She slowly stepped inside, ready to
apologize.  She quietly called for Tomoyo but she didn&#39;t appear
to be inside.  Sakura closed the door behind her.  After
searching for a minute, Sakura sat on Tomoyo&#39;s bed confused.  She
knew Tomoyo&#39;s room was large but it wasn&#39;t THAT large.  Sakura
began to whimper, wanting to clear things up as soon as possible.
     &quot;Tomoyo-chan, where ARE you?&quot;
     Just then, Sakura noticed Tomoyo&#39;s school shirt on the
floor.  She went to it and saw the skirt a little farther away.
They made a trail toward . . .
     &quot;Her movie room!  I almost forgot!  She must be in there.&quot;
     Sakura was relieved that she had found her friend.  But
nothing could have prepared her for the scene she saw when she
entered.

     Tomoyo was completely lost as she exhausted her mind and
body.  She was totally immersed in a fantasy world.  A world
where she and Sakura were best friends and even lovers.  She
didn&#39;t remember anything she was planning on doing or care if
anyone found her.  All that mattered was the smiles on the two
girls faces on the screen.  Just as she was forcing another
orgasm, a giant shadow loomed over the screen.  Tomoyo was
relieved.  Someone had finally found her.  Now her punishment
would be complete.  With luck, they&#39;d yell at her, maybe even
beat her.  And if that wasn&#39;t enough, she could always . . .
     &quot;Tomoyo-chan . . . &quot;
     Tomoyo&#39;s head whirled around at the sound of the timid
voice.  As ready as she was for any kind of punishment, Tomoyo
couldn&#39;t handle Sakura.  She sat motionless in her seat waiting
for Sakura to approach.  But Sakura was frozen in place.  She
couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing.  Her eyes were wide as
saucers as she watched the events of the previous evening play
out literally larger than life.  The clothing she had followed to
find Tomoyo had slowly filtered out of her arms and bundled up
near her feet.  She didn&#39;t even notice the door close behind her.
She just stared . . . and felt another powerful explosion
building.  Tomoyo tried to rush to Sakura and explain but her now
sore body protested such quick movements.  She slowly moved up to
Sakura with tears in her eyes and juices running down her leg.
     &quot;Sakura . . . I . . . please listen.&quot;
     But Sakura wasn&#39;t.  Tomoyo&#39;s words faded as she stared at
the screen.  But what Sakura was seeing wasn&#39;t sex but love, pure
and unconditional.  As wonderful as the feelings in her body were
then, they were overshadowed by the feelings in her heart.
Tomoyo had gone so far just to please her, and she repaid her
with anger and deceit.  Sakura felt terrible at what she had
driven her friend to.  Her best friend who was . . .
     Sakura&#39;s vision now focused on the beautiful young girl
before her.  Her large, now reddish eyes, her long black hair,
pout lips, and pert breasts.  Sakura stared at Tomoyo and came to
a final decision.  The choice she needed and wanted.
     &quot; . . . so please just . . . Sakura-chan?&quot;
     Tomoyo stopped talking when she noticed Sakura&#39;s eyes on
her.  She knew she was naked but Sakura&#39;s intense stare
embarrassed her.  She started to reach for the clothing Sakura
dropped on the floor but Sakura gingerly pushed her back.  Tomoyo
was surprised and a little angry.  She may have been at fault but
she didn&#39;t need her shame to be prolonged any longer.  She just
needed her final punishment.  She looked sternly at Sakura but
received no reaction.  It was almost as if she were in a trance.
Tomoyo started to question Sakura but was stopped short as Sakura
quickly closed the distance between them.
     &quot;Sakura-chan?&quot;
     But Sakura continued to invade Tomoyo&#39;s personal space until
her entire body was touching Tomoyo, her clothing brushing
lightly against Tomoyo&#39;s nude form.  Sakura slowly moved her head
to Tomoyo&#39;s ear and whispered, breaking her silence.
     &quot;You won&#39;t need those.&quot;
     Tomoyo was shocked by Sakura&#39;s remark as she staggered back
a bit, almost tumbling over.  She tried to compose herself but
Sakura was once again upon her, her eyes piercing Tomoyo&#39;s soul.
Sakura slowly took both her hands and held Tomoyo&#39;s head,
caressing her face and cheeks softly.  Tomoyo was terribly
confused and desperately in need of an answer to this situation.
But before she could ask, Sakura answered her without question as
she quickly darted forward and kissed Tomoyo strongly.
Unprepared, Tomoyo managed to break free and catch her breath.
She finally managed to ask her question.
     &quot;S-Sakura-chan?  What are you doing?  What--what do you
want?&quot;
     Sakura thought about all that had happened to the two of
them over the past 24 hours and about the apology she wanted to
give.  But at this moment, all that was secondary.  She answered
Tomoyo with the last word she would say until it was over.
     &quot;You.&quot;
     Tomoyo immediately understood and was overjoyed.  By some
miracle, she had been forgiven.  She was about to run into
Sakura&#39;s arms but before she knew it she was already there,
Sakura closing the gap herself.  She stared once again into
Sakura&#39;s eyes which were loudly speaking her intentions.  She
slowly moved her head forward as Sakura did the same.  The two
met in a beautiful display of passion.  After a moment, Tomoyo
once again reluctantly broke their kiss.  She tugged Sakura
slightly, urging her back to her room.  However, Sakura didn&#39;t
budge.  She just looked at Tomoyo with the same wild eyes as
before.
     &quot;Let&#39;s go back to my room, Sakura-chan.&quot;
     But Sakura answered Tomoyo by lightly caressing her small
breasts, pinching her right nipple.
     &quot;Ahh!  Sakura-chan?  I . . . ohh . . . !  We can&#39;t!  Not
in . . . mmmmm!&quot;
     Tomoyo ceased her objection as she was silenced by another
kiss from Sakura.  Whatever she had planned, it would take place
right then and there.  Tomoyo grudgingly agreed and began to lift
Sakura&#39;s shirt off her body.  But before she could, Sakura
grabbed Tomoyo&#39;s wrists and hauled her shirt back down.
     &quot;S . . . Sakura-chan?&quot;
     Sakura was determined to pay Tomoyo back for her friendship.
Prolonging Tomoyo&#39;s wait with her own wants would just be in the
way.  Sakura felt responsible for Tomoyo&#39;s sadness and was
planning on giving her something she&#39;d remember her entire life.
Sakura wasn&#39;t concerned about herself.  This was Tomoyo&#39;s time.
Sakura wrapped her left arm around Tomoyo and proceeded to kiss
her neck, smiling as she heard her friend coo softly.  She then
caressed the inside of Tomoyo&#39;s thigh, getting her hand sticky
with Tomoyo&#39;s juices.  Sakura brought her hand up to her mouth
and tasted it, much to Tomoyo&#39;s surprise.
     She stared as she watched Sakura&#39;s tongue slowly twist and
squirm around her fingers, tasting Tomoyo with a look of hunger.
Tomoyo started getting excited at this display as she felt a new
trail slowly trickle down her leg.  Noticing this, Sakura smiled
and started to rub Tomoyo&#39;s thin slit directly.  But Tomoyo&#39;s
previous self-abuse proved to be too harsh as she winced at the
slight pain.  Sakura saw her expression and knew what was wrong.
She recalled the pain well.  Sakura closed her eyes in
contemplation.  Tomoyo looked at her in confusion and a bit of
sadness as well, feeling that she was hindering Sakura from even
giving her pleasure.  But after a moment, Sakura opened her eyes
and smiled.  Tomoyo was confused but soon didn&#39;t care as Sakura
slowly licked her throat.  Her tongue traveled down to Tomoyo&#39;s
left breast where she began to lick and suck at Tomoyo&#39;s erect
nipple.  Tomoyo squealed in delight as she grasped Sakura&#39;s head,
holding it to her chest.  But much to her dismay, Sakura soon
stopped this action and stared into her eyes.  Sakura then
enveloped Tomoyo in her arms and slowly slinked her way around
her body.  Tomoyo closed her eyes and purred at the feeling of
the soft cloth rubbing against her body.  But she didn&#39;t notice
Sakura snake her way down her body until she was on her knees.
Sakura smiled at the sight before her and began to lightly trace
a fingernail along Tomoyo&#39;s inner thigh.  Tomoyo opened her eyes
and was surprised to not see Sakura.  Suddenly she felt something
warm and damp on her leg.  She looked down in shock as Sakura was
slowly slurping up the many trails of juice along her legs.  She
stared timidly as Sakura&#39;s increasingly messy face followed the
tiny rivers of passion, eventually reaching their source.
     Sakura stared at Tomoyo&#39;s flower, shining faintly in the
semi-dark room.  She approached it cautiously, inhaling the aroma
her friend was giving off.  Tomoyo was fairly frightened, knees
visibly shaking as she awaited the inevitable contact.  Sakura
pressed her face into Tomoyo&#39;s crotch, nuzzling her nether region
while making herself even more messy.  Tomoyo caught moans under
her breath as she slowly began to rock her hips, pushing herself
into her friend.  Sakura rubbed her face and cheeks into Tomoyo&#39;s
crotch, feeling her friend&#39;s warmth as it spread across her face.
She pulled away slowly, watching as a few sticky strands
stretched from her face to Tomoyo before lightly breaking in the
air.  Sakura looked lovingly at Tomoyo&#39;s pussy, lips slightly
swollen from before.  Sakura raised her hands to it, parting it
slightly with both thumbs.  She looked at the sensitive organ and
blew on it gently.  Tomoyo squealed at the cold intrusion.
Sakura then lightly kissed it, pecking it in various places.
Tomoyo was more than ready for Sakura to start but she continued
toying with her.  Tomoyo began whimpering awaiting release and
Sakura smiled inwardly, remembering how Tomoyo made her
practically beg for contact before.  She felt Tomoyo push the
back of her head with her hands and decided not to make her wait
any longer.  Sakura slowly extended her tongue and laid it at the
bottom of Tomoyo&#39;s pussy.  She wiggled it briefly making Tomoyo
squirm before making one broad stroke from the bottom of Tomoyo&#39;s
slit to the top.
     &quot; . . . OOOOOOHHHH!!!!!&quot;
     With that sound, Sakura began licking at Tomoyo in earnest.
Tomoyo shuddered with passion as she drove Sakura&#39;s head into her
crotch, trying to increase her pleasure as much as possible.  For
her, this was like a dream come true.  There was nothing but
them.  She ran her fingers through Sakura&#39;s hair as she bucked
her hips into Sakura&#39;s face.  Sakura&#39;s head was swimming with the
aroma of her friend.  She increased her licking at a frenzied
pace.  She was caught in a cycle.  The faster she went, the
stronger the aroma and the stronger the smell, the faster she
went.  Sakura thrust her tongue deep into Tomoyo, causing her
legs to buckle and body to shake.  Sakura had noticed a small nub
at the upper part of Tomoyo&#39;s slit that was barely visible.
Whenever she touched it, Tomoyo&#39;s pleasure seemed to increase.
She began focusing on that area and Tomoyo grabbed Sakura&#39;s head
with both hands, confirming her discovery.  Tomoyo began flowing
stronger than before and Sakura savored every drop.  Tomoyo began
panting and moaning at a increasing pace and Sakura knew she was
ready.  Sakura&#39;s hands slowly moved up Tomoyo&#39;s legs until they
reached her rear.  Sakura rubbed it softly with both hands
causing more squirming from Tomoyo.  Suddenly, without warning,
Sakura gripped Tomoyo firmly, forcing her hips into her face.
Using this leverage, Sakura thrust her tongue as far inside
Tomoyo as possible while sucking her lower lips as hard as she
could.
     Tomoyo froze, feeling the soft intruder penetrate farther
than she thought possible.  There was a moment of silence as
Sakura held Tomoyo in place.  Then Tomoyo exploded in a literal
flood of ecstasy, soaking Sakura&#39;s cute face as she yelled for
her friend at the top of her lungs.


     Tomoyo awoke in her room.  It took a second to remember what
happened.  She tried to move but her body refused, too exhausted
to comply.  She stared outward but didn&#39;t see Sakura.  She tried
to look around but was still too weak.  Wondering how she reached
her bed, she suddenly had a terrible thought.  Maybe it was all
just a hallucination.  A final grasp at redemption.  She called
for Sakura, her voice shaking and becoming frantic.
     &quot;Sakura-chan . . . Sakura-chan!  Where are you?!
Sakura . . . &quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot;
     Tomoyo forced herself to jerk around to see Sakura sitting
slightly behind her.
     &quot;Sakura-chan.&quot;
     Tomoyo was obviously relieved as she fell backwards, her
head resting in Sakura&#39;s lap.  Sakura proceeded to run her
fingers through Tomoyo&#39;s hair.
     &quot;Sakura-chan . . . that was wonderful.  But . . . are you
okay with all this?&quot;
     Sakura shook her head and smiled at her friend.
     &quot;Yeah.  I&#39;m really sorry about what I said.  You were just
trying to do what you thought was right.  I just took it too far
without understanding.  I should have talked to you first.&quot;
     Tomoyo flushed slightly at the remark.
     &quot;Well . . . it&#39;s not like I know everything about this.  I&#39;m
fairly new to this as well.  I don&#39;t know much more than you.  I
wanted to ask but was afraid of peoples reactions.&quot;
     &quot;I know what you mean.  So what do we do?&quot;
     Tomoyo closed her eyes in thought, then spoke.
     &quot;Keep living, I suppose.&quot;
     Sakura realized that was really all either of them could do.
Being discovered may be a problem but that shouldn&#39;t affect their
relationship.  The important thing was that she and Tomoyo were
together.  She held Tomoyo&#39;s hand as she stared down at her
newfound lover.  No matter what happened from now on, they would
face it as friends.

     END . . . . . . for now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, that&#39;s the end of my first fanfic.  Hope everyone
liked reading it as much I liked writing it.  Well, the first
time anyway.  Typing hunched over a keyboard for hours sucks.
     I&#39;d rather just have a pencil.

Upcoming stories:
Tenchi/Sasami----MY version
Chibiusa/Usagi

Later stuff:
Chibiusa/Hotaru
Sasami/Misao (Pretty Sammy TV)
Second Card Captor Sakura Trilogy (Li and Mei Lin mostly)
Utena/Anthy?
ChaCha story?
Chibiusa/Helios?

     If you&#39;re wondering why all these stories have young
characters, keep reading.
     If anyone&#39;s still here after the show, I&#39;d like to explain
the method to my madness.
     I&#39;m one of the guys everyone hates.  I&#39;m a constant lurker,
don&#39;t sign any guest books (usually), and only expect to find
totally free hentai on the net.  But besides all that, I think
there are certain people who get bad reps.  Everywhere I go, even
among hentai guys, people who look at fics like these are
considered scum or losers at best.  Pedophiles at worst . . . or
is that the same thing?  Anyhow, I don&#39;t particularly think
that&#39;s fair.  First of all, good writing is good writing.  I&#39;d
rather read a good Sasami story than a crappy Ryoko story.
That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do.  I&#39;m not much on lots of foul
language and dirty slang.  Not that I&#39;m putting that down, I just
can&#39;t write that way.  I&#39;ve been told I&#39;m a bit of a romantic and
that shows in most of my writing.  What I see a LOT of is bad
writing with young characters, which makes it just that much
harder for guys like me.  I&#39;m trying to write some decent stories
with young characters so maybe we can get a LITTLE more respect.
I won&#39;t name names but some of the stuff is ridiculous enough
without it happening to 10 year olds.
     Which brings me to my next point.  I&#39;m trying to be more
realistic as well.  First times involve pain.  Especially if it
were to happen then.  I want my stories to convey more physical
and mental realism.  Not EVERY girl in the world who has sex
enjoys it or if they do, may feel bad afterwards depending on the
situation.  I want more realism, plain and simple.  Not 8 year
olds with older guys up their butts with carrots AND animals in
their pussy . . . oops--said too much.
     Third, I LIKE little girls!  Let&#39;s face it.  The Japanese
culture isn&#39;t exactly against this type of thinking.  In most
shows out there, the &quot;little girl&quot; is usually the most likable of
the cast and there is always a little overshadowing to the
concept of them with the main character or some other guy.
Chibi-Usa and Mamoru, Sasami-chan and Tenchi, the list goes on.
Just look at the RIDICULOUS amount of Ruri Hoshino merchandise.
She&#39;s not the ONLY female on Nadesico, you know.
     Finally, anime age is NOT a fact, it&#39;s a suggestion.  To be
totally honest, ALL anime females look at least 2 years older
than their actual age.  Sailor Moon starts off at 14.  I can
BARELY see that.  I never bought Sasami being 8 as far as age
goes.  I have 8 year old cousins that don&#39;t look close to
whatever age she&#39;s supposed to be.  Plus the, younger characters
are almost ALWAYS the smartest or wisest characters.  Look at
Sasami and to a lesser extent, Washu.  It&#39;s like a trap, I tell
you!
     I also look at Sakura Lemon and see what&#39;s missing.  That
also is part of my reason for picking what I do.  Card Captor
Sakura is that popular and only ONE fic . . . not if I have
anything to say about it.
     But besides all this, just do your own thing.  I own TONS of
this stuff.  Little girls, big girls, mean girls, sweet girls,
whatever.  I don&#39;t put down ANYBODY&#39;S stuff.  I have preferences
like anyone else but I can read them all . . . well, most of
them.  The most important thing to remember is: IT&#39;S NOT REAL!
It&#39;s anime.  I dread the thought of anyone reading my fic and
molesting an elementary school girl.  Let&#39;s all just keep it in
our pants and agree to disagree.  I&#39;ll head to that cool Sasami
story and you can go to that Sailor Moon being raped by tentacles
and killed story.  Whatever floats your boat.
     I&#39;m ALWAYS up for conversation too.  Anyone agree, disagree,
want to ask me something, comment on my stories, or anything,
please do.  I&#39;ll ignore flames of course. I get that from my own
family.  But any actual criticism will be commented on.  I&#39;m still
worried about my writing.

     That&#39;s it.  Sorry for babbling so long.  If you&#39;re still
here, that is.
