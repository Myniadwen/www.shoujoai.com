<h1>The Enchantress</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>AUTHOR&#146;S NOTE: This takes place several years into the future, placing 
both Tomoyo and Meiling roughly around the age of twenty five. I&#39;ve 
always said that I wish at least one fanfic would place Tomoyo as a 
famous singer instead of being a director, fashion designer, or CEO of 
Daidouji Toys. This is a short little piece about Tomoyo&#39;s life as a 
singer told from Meiling&#39;s point of view.

 

Meiling always knew one day the entire world would know of Daidouji 
Tomoyo and the bewitching charm she possessed. She also knew that once 
they did they too would be enchanted by her. Pulled in by those 
glittering blue eyes, clear as the sky and pure with the emotion they 
held within, seduced by the rose dusted lips which opened to reveal a 
melodic voice that was a modern day siren&#39;s song.

There was no doubt about it, Tomoyo made the perfect shining star.

Sometimes when they were alone, away from the flash of the cameras and 
the shouts of the press, Tomoyo would lie in the crook of her arm and 
giggle quietly. A smile would spread on her gentle features and playing 
with some article of Meiling&#39;s clothing she would talk about how strange 
this all was. How she hadn&#39;t expected a simple concert at their former 
university to lead to all of this.

And she would wonder what they saw in her.

Perhaps that was part of her charm, Meiling realized. That despite the 
endless compliments she received from her agent, her recording company, 
and legions of fans she never quite understood it. She simply saw 
herself as Tomoyo and found it quite silly that she was getting so much 
attention for just singing songs.

&quot;I think you&#39;re much more impressive,&quot; Tomoyo would murmur, entwining 
their fingers and flexing them gently. Studying them for a long moment 
only to pull away and trace the tips lightly over Meiling&#39;s skin, 
learning every muscle there in a memorized touch. &quot;You&#39;re more amazing 
than anyone could ever know.&quot;

Although she heard time and time again how wonderful her lover found 
her, Meiling never quite got used to hearing the words and would blush 
a deep red as she averted her eyes in a lame attempt to hide her 
embarrassment. When she did Tomoyo would be there, cupping her face in 
a soft hold that turned into an easy caress, the back of her long 
fingers drifting across Meiling&#39;s cheek.

&quot;Do you know how lovely you are?&quot; Tomoyo would sometimes whisper.

It depended on the day, the mood of the particular moment, or perhaps 
even the very alignment of the stars on what she would say to Meiling in 
an embrace. No matter what, her words always filled Meiling with a sort 
of emotional ecstasy that heightened when coupled with Tomoyo&#39;s firm, 
knowing, and wet kisses.

Her kisses were like Tomoyo herself, a honeyed sweetness that was 
addictive in the exhilaration that it leant, leaving you begging for 
more. Only she never had to beg with Tomoyo, anything she could imagine 
wanting became hers before she realized she might want it. Somehow 
Tomoyo knew and maybe it was in that knowing lay the reason that Meiling 
worshipped her so.

Or maybe it was because of how Tomoyo kissed. She would kiss with her 
entire body and nearly as soon as the kisses would begin Meiling was 
completely lost to them. Intoxicated by the soft pressure of Tomoyo&#39;s 
tongue sweeping against hers to enter her mouth, tasting her with a 
tender demand. Wanting in her kiss to have everything Meiling was 
willing to give and god help her...

Meiling gave everything to Tomoyo.

In those long arms, pale and seemingly weak, Meiling surrendered herself 
on countless occasions. She was certain it had to do with the fact that 
in the back of her mind she knew that physically she was far more 
powerful than Tomoyo but it was more than that. Yes, it was so much 
more. It was the fact that Meiling trusted herself to be helpless in 
Tomoyo&#39;s presence.

What felt like many long years ago, her lover had proven that she could 
hold her own amongst some of the most intimidating people Meiling had 
ever known. More than that, she had proven herself to Meiling. Proven 
herself to be trusted, to be true, to be utterly deserving of her total 
loyalty and love.

To possess not only the loyalty but the love of member from the House of 
Li was no easy task to accomplish. Thanks to their strict upbringing 
they were all taught from an early age to have a higher level of 
standards. As such, they were required to hold up any potential romantic 
partners against these same standards.

Many people, worthy or no, have been chased away because of this. Even 
the powerful Master of the Clow felt herself waver under the scrupulous 
attention she was given in the days before her wedding to Shaoran. It 
was in these hours that Tomoyo leant her support and helped Sakura find 
the confidence within herself that told her quite clearly she had more 
than earned her place in Shaoran&#39;s life.

Perhaps because of this Tomoyo never felt much anxiety about her own 
judgment at the hands of Meiling&#39;s relatives when their relationship was 
revealed. Though there was disapproval, particularly at the hands of 
Meiling&#39;s own parents, the union came under the support of Ieran and as 
head of their House her word was final. Despite this, each trip to Hong 
Kong and the main house was always met by whispers and stares, cold in 
their judgment and prejudice.

Tomoyo replied to the whispers and met the stares and after this she 
would look fondly to Meiling, squeeze her hand, caress her face, and 
kiss her lips. Uncaring of whatever the reaction to this might be.

It had to be a funny type of irony that Tomoyo, who appeared as delicate 
and breakable as the finest crystal goblet, had an indestructible 
strength in character. Once she made up her mind, it would not and could 
not be changed. The faith she held in the people she loved was as 
immense and vast as space.

And just like space, her faith couldn&#39;t be charted. At least, not in 
this lifetime. It was simply too much... too overwhelming for anyone to 
take on. All they could do with it was to look and marvel at the 
impressive spectacle it made.

Perhaps envy it as well.

She was kindness and she was light but when Tomoyo would come to her, 
eyes darkened with desire and body warmed with want, she was wicked 
indeed. But in such a very good way that only served to make Meiling 
love her more.

Though she wasn&#39;t sure why, sometimes when they made love Meiling 
wondered what Tomoyo&#39;s fans would think of her. After all, they held her 
up to an impossible standard of perfection that very few could come 
close to meeting. Would they sigh at the beauty of blue eyes that burned 
powerfully into them? Would they arch at the soft hands that were 
perfect in the gentle strength which held them? Would they quiver at the 
feeling of silken gray hair that brushed against them?

Or would they simply faint from the entire experience?

Sometimes Meiling felt like fainting when they kissed. It was almost too 
much for her, the amount that Tomoyo loved her, was willing to give her. 
For all of Meiling&#39;s life she had been the outcast, the disappointment, 
the Li without any shred of magical power. She was raised to believe she 
was useless.

Unless she produced babies, that is. Then she was worth something 
because maybe, just maybe, those babies would have magic.

Following Shaoran to Japan saved her life, Meiling knew this now. 
Without that, she would still believe herself to be nothing more than a 
bride in waiting. Than a vessel for producing more heirs to the House of 
Li.

Now she was so much more. She was Li Meiling, protector, lover, friend, 
and confidant and she was a strong woman. One who finally knew her own 
worth but would still watch Tomoyo&#39;s face reflected in the moonlight and 
ask what the other woman saw in her. What she ever did that made Tomoyo 
choose her.

The question was never really answered because Meiling never dared find 
the courage to ask her lover and face the quiet anger she knew would 
surface. There was one thing anyone close to Tomoyo knew not to question 
and that was her feelings for Meiling. They were sacred to her and 
always would be.

All the doubts would wash away with a single kiss though. When Tomoyo&#39;s 
soft lips pressed against her own and her tongue sought entrance into 
her mouth to taste her sweetly. Her gentle hands burning a path across 
Meiling&#39;s skin, learning the curves of her body perfectly and painting 
her as if she was a picture.

In those moments all Meiling could think of was Tomoyo.

Tomoyo as her clothes were removed in a smooth and very well practiced 
movement, Tomoyo as her skin was ravished with kisses, Tomoyo as her 
lips were claimed and conquered opening her deep, and Tomoyo as she 
spread her legs and an expert tongue swept into her, crushing the last 
of her resistance. If there ever was any resistance to begin with.

The world claimed Tomoyo for their own because her voice spoke to them. 
What she sang about, the love and the pain, were universal concepts. 
They didn&#39;t really know Tomoyo though. No, only Meiling could claim 
that.

Only Meiling knew how Tomoyo cried long and hard with shuddering gasps 
when she finally allowed herself to realize Sakura could never be hers. 
Only Meilin knew Tomoyo felt uncomfortable with constant praise and 
empty compliments her singing leant her. Only Meiling knew she was 
frightened by the hungry eyes of her fans that raked across her body 
with a familiarity that made her cold inside. Only Meiling knew the 
night before a concert, hidden by the veil of darkness, Tomoyo would 
practice for hours on end just to make sure she sounded perfect.

Only Meiling knew that sometimes Tomoyo wanted to quit.

The desire never stayed with her though. Because as soon as it came it 
went with the words of a devoted fan telling her earnestly how her 
lyrics and her voice had saved them. Had delivered them from some 
horrible fate and Tomoyo once again found her reason for continuing to 
exist in the view of the public.

She put on a brave front but Meiling knew it bothered her lover. She 
knew because there were nights when Tomoyo would return from whatever 
event she&#39;d been asked to attend and she wouldn&#39;t speak to her. No, 
instead she would simply draw Meiling to her and bury her face in the 
curve of her neck, breathing in the flowery scent before kissing her 
with a frantic type of need.

During those nights Tomoyo would possess Meiling completely. Her sweet 
voice would turn husky and deep, growling low as she pressed their 
bodies tightly together, ripping and clawing until Meiling was naked 
before her. Then blue eyes darkened and glinted as they saw what they 
would be feasting upon.

And through all of this she was still the same Tomoyo that Meiling had 
fallen in love with. She was gentle and she was loving but now the need 
she felt for her lover was driven by an urgency that simply couldn&#39;t be 
denied.

Not that she wanted to even entertain the thought. Especially not when 
Tomoyo moved down her body, covering it with kisses but traveling with a 
clear purpose as a long tongue slid inside her to taste everything that 
she was. Meiling&#39;s hands would tangle in long gray hair and press her 
closer yet, wanting Tomoyo deeper inside, or perhaps just wanting 
Tomoyo. More than that, needing her.

When Meiling reached orgasm, her body shaking with pleasure, her fingers 
buried in Tomoyo&#39;s hair, clutching to her desperately, she knew it was 
all for her. This was for her and no one else. The world might think 
they knew her lover, they might even think they loved her, but only 
Meiling was rewarded this special gift.

The world was now enchanted by Daidouji Tomoyo and her charms just as 
Meiling had predicted. At first, Meiling was jealous at the attention 
they gave her lover, worried that perhaps it would cause Tomoyo to leave 
her as she was exposed to person after person who adored her completely.

Soon Meiling learned to think better than that because in those urgent 
nights of desire and need, wrapped up in Tomoyo&#39;s fervent love making 
she discovered a most astounding fact. That somehow, she had enchanted 
the enchantress.

Which was something to be proud of indeed.</pre>
