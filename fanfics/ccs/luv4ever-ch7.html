<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>AT THREE MONTHS:

Tomoyo and her mother spent many a sleepless night coming up with ideas 
for some new clothes and how they would look. Sakura, in the meantime 
was reading up on anything she thought would help her and Tomoyo be the 
best parents they could be. One night when Tomoyo came home, Sakura told 
her that they were invited over to her fathers house for dinner. He had 
already asked Sonomi and she reluctantly agreed. After dinner, everyone 
went into the living room to have desert. Sakura took her share and 
leaned back on the couch. She was just starting to show, and Touya 
noticed. She hadn&#39;t told them yet that she was pregnant, and she wasn&#39;t 
sure how to.

&quot;Kaiju looks like she doesn&#39;t need any more food.&quot; He said while gently 
poking her belly. Sakura sat up and glared at him while he went on about 
how desert was going to go straight to her thighs or something.

&quot;For your information, I&#39;m not getting fat! I&#39;m pregnant!&quot; She suddenly 
realized what she said and blushed as she looked away.

Everyone except Sonomi and Tomoyo dropped their forks and just looked at 
her in confusion.

&quot;What? Really? You mean... I&#39;m going to be a grandfather!?&quot;

Yukito just looked at her and smiled while Touya started ranting.

&quot;You mean... that Gaki, he put his... you and him...&quot;

&quot;No, no, no. Well... yeah, we did but...&quot;

&quot;Come on Touya, calm down.&quot; Yukito said. Putting his hands on Touya&#39;s 
shoulders to try to relax him. Sakura just looked at everyone and 
thought it would be best just to tell everyone the truth. Everyone knew 
about her and her magic. Well, everyone except her father. Touya had 
always suspected that she had some kind of special powers, but he never 
did figure out just how special they were. Sakura sighed and started 
explaining about everything. About the Clow book, the cards and the 
mysterious things that kept happening around town while she was trying 
to capture them. Touya was a little stunned, but not alot. He was 
perceptive and he would have probably figured it out sooner or later 
anyway. Her father however, thought she was telling a fantasy story and 
clapped when she finished. Everyone looked at him then back at each 
other.

&quot;He doesn&#39;t get it Sakura.&quot; Said Touya.

Sighing, she stood up and called for Kero-chan to come downstairs.

&quot;Who&#39;s Kero-chan?&quot; Asked her father.

&quot;YO!&quot;

&quot;Oh!, you mean your plushie? Neat, I didn&#39;t know he could fly. Is he 
remote controlled or something?&quot; He said while pulling and tugging on 
his arms and legs.

&quot;Ow, Ow, Ow! Knock it off will ya!?&quot;

Sakura looked to Yukito then to Kero and nodded. Yukito stood up and 
Kero floated up beside him while Touya and Sonomi picked up the coffee 
table and moved it out of the way. Yukito and Kero smiled at her father 
and were inveloped in their wings as they transformed into their true 
forms. Fujitaka just clapped and said that Sakura was becoming a good 
Magician. Sakura sighed and sat back down on the couch, wondering if 
there was any way to get through to her father. Tomoyo leaned over and 
whispered something in her ear.

&quot;Good idea Tomoyo-chan!&quot;

Sakura opened the clow book and pulled out a card. She handed it to her 
father and told him she put all of her hopes of having a child into this 
card and that the other  cards did too. Fujitaka turned the card over 
and smiled. He ran his fingers over what had to be the most beautiful 
thing he ever saw. He closed his eyes and held it close.

&quot;Nadeshiko...&quot;

Sakura walked over and sat next to her father. She leaned over and 
hugged him tightly as he continued to look at    the card.

&quot;When I sealed it away, I knew. I knew that it was mother when I saw the 
picture on the card. She came back to us. She came back in the way that 
she knew would help us the most. Our hope.&quot;

Fujitaka hugged his daughter closer and gave her a kiss on the forehead. 
&quot;Thank You Sakura. Thank You for returning to us. Thank You for bringing 
back all of your hopes and dreams, even though some may have been lost 
or broken. You are very special to us Sakura-chan. Don&#39;t you ever forget 
that.&quot;

Sonomi and Touya put the coffee table back and everyone finished eating 
their deserts. With a little help from Kero-chan of course.

Their little gathering started to wind down and everyone went their 
seperate ways. Making sure to give the mother to be and her wife a hug 
before they left.

&quot;Ohhhh... I can&#39;t belive I&#39;m a Grandfather!&quot; Fujitaka exclaimed.

&quot;Oh great. Another little Kaiju running amok in this town. That&#39;s all we 
need. I&#39;d rather have the clow cards wreaking havok.&quot;

&quot;Good night dad! Good night &#39;Uncle Touya&#39;!&quot;

Sakura and Tomoyo headed back to their apartment to get some sleep. As 
usual, after the got ready for bed, Sakura sat on the bed while Tomoyo 
laid her head in her lap and sang to the baby. Usually, Tomoyo&#39;s singing 
put Sakura to sleep as well, but not tonight. Sakura had trouble falling 
asleep.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan... You sing to me and the baby every night. But I feel like 
you need something special too.&quot;

&quot;No. I&#39;m fine Sakura. I love singing to you and the baby. It makes me 
happy to.&quot; 

Sakura sat Tomoyo up and pulled her close. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan, I want to sing to you for a change. Can I? I know it won&#39;t 
be nearly as beautiful as your singing, but I want to try.&quot;

Tomoyo&#39;s eyes got wide and she choked back the tears that threatened to 
come forth. Sitting on their knees while facing each other, Sakura 
pulled Tomoyo into another hug and started singing. Tomoyo couldn&#39;t hold 
back her tears as she recognized the lullaby Sakura was singing. It was 
the same lullaby that her mother sang when she was young. She nestled 
into her chest as she continued to listen. And to cry.

&quot;Sakura-chan...&quot;

Sakura got a brilliant idea and moved closer to Tomoyo until she had to 
stand up, pausing her singing only for a moment.

&quot;Please Sakura-chan... just a little longer?&quot; Tomoyo asked through her 
tears.

Sakura stood in front of her lovely wife and wrapped her arms around 
her. She slid one hand down her back and let it rest on Tomoyo&#39;s 
backside. Sakura bent down, and in one swift movement, she scooped up 
Tomoyo, hugging her tightly to her chest as she started singing again. 
Tomoyo was always a little surprised at her wife&#39;s stregnth. Being so 
athletic through most of her life, Sakura had grown into a beautifully 
toned, yet gentle woman. Tomoyo&#39;s shock quickly faded as she felt so 
relaxed, so safe in Sakura&#39;s loving arms. Sakura slowly made her way 
around the apartment while holding her beloved. She felt so warm. So 
soft and delicate. So...perfect. Tomoyo was so happy. A warm, fuzzy 
feeling washed over her as she felt Sakura&#39;s hand gently rubbing her 
back, soothing her. Half asleep, Tomoyo spoke:

&quot;Sakura-chan is going to make a wonderful mother. She&#39;s so loving.&quot;

Sakura blushed.

&quot;You too Tomoyo-chan. I wouldn&#39;t be able to do this... not without you.&quot; 

After Tomoyo fell asleep, Sakura took her back to their room and tucked 
her into bed. Sakura knew she wouldn&#39;t get much sleep tonight, so she 
picked up a book and headed into the living room to read. She turned on 
a lamp read late into the night.
