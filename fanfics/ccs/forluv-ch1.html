<h1>For the Love of a Friend</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/overstreet.html">Clayton Overstreet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sakura smiled as she saw Madison waiting by her mail box. Grabbing her
back pack and a pop tart she headed for the door. Tory peeked out from
the dinning room, &quot;Hey squirt, remember that I&#39;m going to Julian&#39;s
after school today.&quot;

Sakura nodded, &quot;Ok Tory, I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; She was out the door and
next to Madison in a heart beat. &quot;Hi Madison, how&#39;s it going?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m doing good Sakura. I didn&#39;t miss out on any card captures last
night did I?&quot; Madison asked.

Sakura shook her head, &quot;Nope. It was a pretty quiet night, except Kero
wouldn&#39;t stop playing that video game all night. I barely got any
sleep.&quot;

Madison giggled. &quot;Well you know how addicted Kero is to those games.&quot;

The walked on chatting about what had been going on in school lately.
Then from the corner of her eyes she saw Lee and Maylin walking up
behind them. Madison smiled and said, &quot;Hi Lee, what have you been up
to?&quot;

Lee shrugged and kept walking, obviously trying to ignore Maylin who
was trying to cling to his arm. He looked at Sakura suspiciously. &quot;What
have you been up to lately?&quot;

Sakura pretended she didn&#39;t hear him and continued talking with
Madison. When they got to school lee ran on ahead, trying to slip away
from Maylin who followed closely behind. &quot;I think Lee likes you
Sakura.&quot; Madison said.

Sakura wrinkled her nose. &quot;Mr. Personality? No thanks.&quot;

Madison smiled, &quot;Oh yeah? Then who do you like?&quot;

Sakura blushed and tried to think of a response. Just then the bell
rang and she smiled happily. Quickly they ran inside and to their class
room. Miss Makinzy smiled at them as they came through the door.
&quot;Cutting it a little close today girls?&quot; They both smiled at her and
sat down as the class started.

During lunch Sakura grabbed her lunch and sat with Madison and her
other friends at their usual table. &quot;So how did you do on the test
today Sakura?&quot; Madison asked.

Sakura moaned and rolled her eyes. &quot;Well like I told you I didn&#39;t get
much sleep last night. I just hope I didn&#39;t totally flunk.&quot;

Madison grinned at her and shook her head. &quot;You are way to smart to do
anything like that Sakura.&quot;

Sakura blushed and took a bite of her food. She always liked it when
Madison complimented her like that. Of course she would never be able
to tell Madison that the real reason she had done so poorly on the test
was that she kept glancing at Madison and spacing out, drawing hearts
on her paper.

Madison elbowed Sakura in her side and she snapped to attention. &quot;Are
you alright Sakura? You were just staring at the table. It was like you
didn&#39;t even hear the bell.&quot;

Sakura looked up and her blush deepened as she realized everyone else
was gone. &quot;Um... I was just thinking about... that costume you made me
last time. It was really good Madison.&quot;

Madison smiled at her. &quot;You really think so? I mean I know some of them
look a bit silly but did you really like it?&quot;

Sakura nodded. &quot;Yes, I did. I like all your costumes Madison.&quot;

Madison seemed to forget all about Sakura&#39;s momentary lapse into dream
land as they discussed some of the different costumes Sakura had worn
since she had become a card captor. However, despite what Sakura
thought, Madison noticed that her friend had seemed decidedly
embarrassed about something. Oh well, if it was important she was sure
Sakura would tell her.

During art class Sakura asked Madison to pose for a portrait. &quot;Why
me?&quot;

Sakura smiled, &quot;Because you have so many pictures of me that you use
for the costumes that I want one of you.&quot; Madison smiled and sat down
on the stool while Sakura sketched out her face.

After a while Miss Makinzy came around to check out their work. When
she got to Sakura&#39;s she stopped and smiled. &quot;Very good detailing
Sakura. You seem to know Madison&#39;s face very well.&quot; She moved on,
unknowingly leaving Sakura blushing. She glanced at Madison who was
grinning at her. Sakura felt a warm glow in her chest and got back to
work. By the end of class she had just finished when the bell rang.

Sakura put down the colored pencils and slipped her drawing into her
backpack. Madison got up and stretched her legs out. &quot;Those stools are
hard.&quot;

Sakura looked at her apologetically. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Madison. If I had known
that you were uncomfortable I could have finished it without you
sitting there.&quot;

Madison smiled and shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s alright Sakura. After all the
times I&#39;ve made you pose and stand still while I was cutting those
costumes for you this was only fair. Besides I wouldn&#39;t want you to be
unable to finish just because I wasn&#39;t posing.&quot;

Sakura shook her head. &quot;I enjoy posing for you Madison. And believe me
I know your face well enough that I could have probably done it after
the rough sketch.&quot;

Madison smiled at her and Sakura blushed realizing what she had just
said. Fortunately Madison didn&#39;t seem to notice. &quot;Well we have known
each other our whole lives, so I shouldn&#39;t be too surprised.&quot; Sakura
mentally sighed in relief as she turned to pick up her pack. &quot;When we
get back to your house can I see it?&quot;

Sakura kicked herself. She knew this was a bad idea, but she couldn&#39;t
think of anything else to draw. &quot;S-sure Madison.&quot;

As they walked away from the school Madison noticed that Sakura was
very quiet. Sakura meanwhile was deciding if she shouldn&#39;t have a small
&#39;accident&#39; with the picture. If Madison knew how she felt about her,
then didn&#39;t like her anymore, it would kill her. After a while though
she decided to just let her see it. Most likely Madison wouldn&#39;t
notice. But what if she did?

By the time they got to her house Sakura had had at least three
different fantasies. In the first one Madison saw how Sakura felt and
was totally disgusted. In the second she didn&#39;t notice anything at
all... and Sakura wasn&#39;t sure which would be worse. In the third
Madison saw it, accepted it, and still wanted to be friends. That one
made Sakura smile. &quot;What are you thinking about Sakura?&quot;

Sakura looked at Madison still smiling. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Madison smiled and shook her head. &quot;You&#39;ve been out of it all day. Half
the time you were drawing my picture you just stopped and stared at my
face.&quot;

Sakura blushed and tried to look like everything was normal. &quot;I&#39;m just
thinking about Clow cards. I think I&#39;ve almost gotten all of them.&quot;

Madison smiled. &quot;You&#39;re right. You only have a few more to go.&quot;

Sakura unlocked the door and they went inside. &quot;Kero, I&#39;m home!&quot;

The guardian beast flew down the stairs and looked at her. &quot;It&#39;s about
time. I&#39;m starving.&quot;

Sakura sighed and glanced at Madison apologetically. Madison winked
and Sakura went to the kitchen to fix Kero something to eat.

Madison sat back on the couch and looked around. Sakura&#39;s house was
a lot smaller than hers. Madison always thought it was kind of sweet.
She looked around and noticed her hand next to Sakura&#39;s back pack.
Without thinking she reached in and pulled out the drawing Sakura had
done of her.

At first she just smiled. Sakura had indeed been very detailed.
Incredibly detailed in fact. There was that tiny mole on the side of her
neck, that slight dimple at the edge of her eye, even the tiny hair
that had been tickling her the entire time she had been trying to stay
still... Madison stopped and stared, running her fingers over the
image. This was too good.

It wasn&#39;t that she thought Sakura had used magic to draw it. She just
was caught off guard by how detailed everything was. It was like that
drawing Miss Makinzy had pointed out at the museum that one time. By
the man who had been in love with the woman in his painting. Miss
Makinzy had pointed out how he had refused to miss or add any details
like so many of the other artists had done. He had claimed that there
was nothing that could make it better.

She heard Kero thank Sakura in the kitchen and quickly slipped the
picture back into Sakura&#39;s back pack. &quot;So Madison do you want to see
that picture now?&quot;

Madison shook her head, &quot;I just remembered Sakura. My mother wanted me
to do some chores after school.&quot;

Sakura smiled. &quot;Do you want me to help?&quot;

Madison shook her head. &quot;N-no thank you Sakura. It&#39;s some stuff I&#39;ll
have to do for myself. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow... unless there is another
card to capture. Then you call me and I&#39;ll come running with my video
camera.&quot;

Sakura nodded and smiled at her. &quot;I promise I&#39;ll call you Madison.&quot;

Madison grabbed her bag and ran out the door shouting a quick goodbye
to Sakura. As she left Sakura sighed. She had actually been kind of
hoping that Madison would see the picture and tell her what she
thought. &quot;Oh well, I can always show it to her later.&quot;

Madison ran for a long time. She wasn&#39;t entirely sure where she was
going, but she knew it wasn&#39;t home. &quot;I need to think. That&#39;s all. I
mean there&#39;s no way she could feel like what I was thinking. We&#39;re too
young. And it&#39;s just friendship.&quot; She repeated that to herself several
times on the way. Finally she found herself at the park. She sat down
on the bench and shook her head.

&quot;So what is the problem?&quot; A voice said inside her. Madison sighed. She
always hated that little voice in the back of her head. &quot;She&#39;s my best
friend that&#39;s what. And she&#39;s a girl. Besides I&#39;m sure I was just
imagining things.&quot;

&quot;If that&#39;s so then why did you imagine that?&quot; The voice asked.

Madison didn&#39;t have an answer for that one. She thought back over her
relationship with Sakura. They had been friends for a long time. Their
entire lives in fact. Madison had most of the last few years on film.
But even she couldn&#39;t picture Sakura in the exacting detail she had
seen in that drawing. Or could she?

Madison closed her eyes and tried to think about Sakura. She was
actually a bit nervous about the idea, but something told her to do
this. In fact the voice in the back of her head insisted.

Slowly she pictured Sakura. Her smile, the way her hair blew around her
face as she skated. Suddenly all the blurred edges of the image in her
mind sharpened to crystal clarity. She could see every detail of
Sakura&#39;s face... then that damn voice had to remind her about the times
they had showered together. Madison blushed and opened her eyes. &quot;Ok,
ok I love her too, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can do anything about it.
Suppose she doesn&#39;t really feel the same way about me?&quot;

The voice laughed. &quot;Only one way to find out isn&#39;t there?&quot; Madison
sighed and got up, walking towards her house for real this time. She
was going to have to give this some careful thought.

Kero had finished eating and had taken a nap on the kitchen table, but
was woken up when he heard the front door open and close. He flew to
the counter between the kitchen and the living room and took on his
stuffed animal pose. Just as he got into place Tory and Julian came
around the corner. Sakura was sitting on the couch staring at a paper
in her hand that Kero couldn&#39;t quite make out.

Tory stopped by the couch and snapped his fingers by Sakura&#39;s ear, &quot;Hey
squirt, what are you looking at?&quot;

Sakura jumped and looked up at him and Julian blushing. &quot;Um, just a
picture I drew today in art class...&quot;

Julian peeked around Tory&#39;s shoulder and looked at it. &quot;Wow Sakura,
that&#39;s a great drawing. Very life like, right Tory?&quot;

Tory made a noncommittal sound and turned to the kitchen to make himself
and Julian a snack. He stopped and stared at Kero for a second. The
guardian beast sat absolutely still, not even breathing. &quot;I swear
sometimes this thing seems alive.&quot; He grabbed some pudding containers
and motioned for Julian to follow him upstairs.

Julian smiled and rubbed Sakura&#39;s head, &quot;Great drawing Sakura.&quot; Then he
started up the stairs after Tory.

When they were gone Kero flew over to Sakura, who was once again
engrossed in whatever was on the picture. He landed on the couch behind
her shoulder and looked down at the picture. It was a portrait of
Madison. As he looked it over Kero had to agree Sakura had done a good
job on it. He looked at Sakura and saw a contented smiled and her face.

Then Sakura did something that shocked him. Slowly, without even really
thinking, Sakura leaned down and kissed the picture on the cheek. Then
she sat back and stared at it again. Kero was so surprised all he could
do for several seconds was sit and stare.

Finally he managed to get himself under control and cleared his throat
right in Sakura&#39;s ear. She jumped slightly and looked at him. &quot;Oh, Kero
you startled me... how long have you been there?&quot;

Kero grinned at her, &quot;Long enough. You have something you want to tell
me?&quot;

Sakura blushed and slipped the picture back into her pack. &quot;I don&#39;t
think so Kero. I don&#39;t think you could understand.&quot;

Kero frowned. &quot;Just because I&#39;m not human doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t know
what goes on Sakura. Besides it&#39;s not like I&#39;ll tell anyone.&quot;

Sakura sighed and looked at him. She needed to talk to someone. &quot;Fine,
I&#39;m in love with her.&quot;

Kero shrugged, &quot;And?&quot;

Sakura looked at him annoyed. &quot;What do you mean &#39;And?&#39;&quot;

Kero shook his head. &quot;I figured that much out a while ago Sakura.&quot;

Sakura blushed. Was it really that obvious. &quot;Well it&#39;s not exactly
something I can just tell her.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; He asked.

&quot;B-because... she&#39;s a girl. And she&#39;s my best friend. What if she
doesn&#39;t like me any more?&quot;

Kero shook his head. &quot;Sakura I&#39;m ashamed of you. Nothing you could do
would make Madison not like you. Even if she doesn&#39;t feel the same way
you should still tell her.&quot;

Sakura sighed and leaned back. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right. Maybe tomorrow.&quot;

Madison shook her head. It was the middle of the night and that voice
in her head still wouldn&#39;t shut up. And the worst part was it was
making sense. Every time she tried to convince herself that Sakura
wasn&#39;t in love with her it kept bringing up moments from the past that
showed that she did.

By bed time Madison was kicking herself for not seeing it sooner. How
much pain had Sakura been in while she hadn&#39;t even noticed. It wasn&#39;t
right. And why hadn&#39;t Sakura told her?

Then Madison picked up a picture of them together at the zoo. They were
smiling and hugging. &quot;I guess I can understand. I mean we had a great
friendship and I guess she didn&#39;t want to ruin that.&quot;

The voice in her head laughed. &quot;That and she didn&#39;t want to hurt you.&quot;

Madison sighed. &quot;Are you at least going to let me get some sleep
tonight?&quot; The voice remained quiet she took that as a yes. Setting
the picture down Madison covered up with the blanket and smiled
contentedly. Closing her eyes she once again saw Sakura&#39;s image in her
mind.

Sakura yawned as she woke up with the sun shining on her face. She had
been up half the night talking with Kero and was glad that today was
Saturday. Sakura had decided that when she saw Madison today she would
show her the picture she had drawn and tell her how she really felt
about her. Kero had convinced her that Madison would still want to be
friends, even if she didn&#39;t want to be anything else. They were still
pretty young after all.

At breakfast Tory told her that he was going to the park to play
baseball and her dad had to work all day. After that she had slipped
some pancakes out of the stack and carried them upstairs for Kero who
was still asleep.

She tried watching some cartoons to kill time, but all that was on was
some old Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball reruns. So she decided to get
dressed and head over to Madison&#39;s house, hoping it wasn&#39;t too early in
the morning.

When she got there she knocked on the door, which was answered by
Madison&#39;s mother. &quot;Oh hello Sakura. Madison is upstairs in her room.&quot;

Sakura smiled. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

Madison&#39;s mother shrugged, &quot;No problem. I have some business meetings
so I&#39;ll be gone all day. Have fun.&quot; Sakura smiled and turned towards
the stairs.

Upstairs Madison was trying on different outfits, trying to think what
would be best to wear when she talked to Sakura. The blue dress and
that blouse with the button missing? No, that was a bit much. Maybe one
of the costumes she had made during her, &#39;I want to be Sakura&#39;s
sidekick&#39; phase before she had found out that you had to have magical
powers from birth. No, those were way to flashy.

There was a soft knock on her door. It was probably her mother. &quot;Come
in!&quot;

Sakura stepped through the door, causing Madison to stop in her tracks.
The voice in the back of her head said, &quot;Uh oh.&quot; Madison shook her
head. Why had she thought that? She was happy to see Sakura, had been
thinking about it all night.

&quot;Hi Sakura. I didn&#39;t know you were here.&quot; Madison said smiling.

Sakura smiled. &quot;Your mom let me in. Sorry I am so early, but I wanted
to talk to you. Would you like me to step outside while you change?&quot;

Madison was suddenly acutely aware that she was standing in front of
the person she loved in only her night shirt. But it wasn&#39;t like Sakura
hadn&#39;t seen her in it before. &quot;It&#39;s alright Sakura, I wanted to talk to
you too.&quot;

Sakura looked surprised and sat down on the bed. &quot;You go first.&quot; She
said quickly.

Madison smiled and sat down next to her. She couldn&#39;t help but notice
how Sakura blushed and actually seemed to glance over her body. &quot;I saw
that picture you drew yesterday.&quot;

Sakura looked at her in shock, absently squeezing the strap on her
pack. &quot;But... but I didn&#39;t...&quot;

Madison smiled at her. &quot;I wanted to tell you that I... I think I know
how you feel Sakura. I thought it over and I think I feel the same way.
If I&#39;m reading anything into it where I shouldn&#39;t I&#39;m sorry but...&quot; She
stopped talking and smiled at Sakura.

Sakura bit her lip and closed her eyes, trying to hold back tears.
Finally without opening her eyes she said. &quot;You weren&#39;t reading
anything into it Madison. I love you. I have for a long time. In fact
that&#39;s what I wanted to tell you.&quot; She kept her eyes closed, still half
way expecting Madison to say that wasn&#39;t what she meant.

But when she felt Madison&#39;s lips press against hers she opened her
eyes. Madison looked back at her still kissing her. Sakura began
kissing back and slowly they put their arms around each other. For both
girls it was probably the best moment of their lives.

When they broke apart they looked into each others eyes and smiled. &quot;I
love you Sakura.&quot; Madison said.

&quot;I love you too Madison.&quot; Sakura responded.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Author&#39;s note
I almost had the voice card show up and turn out to be the voice
Madison kept hearing. But that would have ruined the mood. Plus I
figured that Sakura would need the create card to beat it and since it
was day time that was out. I hope you enjoyed this story as is though.
If not feel free to write your own.
