<h1>Remastered II (part 2 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster2-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Beneath Northwest High

Within the newly renamed Project-Sakura (formerly an old Judgment
monitoring station)

Within the heavily fortified holochamber training room within the
complex.

Eliza removes her uniform jacket, tossing it onto the chair to the side
of the room. The only things &quot;Active&quot; in the holo sim being a pop-up
target array set to the far wall, a chair, and a back-barrier (with
Crystal Tritanium windows) set across the doorway out just in case
somebody entered while she was training. Garbed in the durable cloth of
her Alliance uniform, she shakes off her tension and relaxes her muscles
as she prepares to move.

One hand carefully slides the headpiece into place, one finger pushing
one of the buttons as it clicks into her wetware jacks behind her ears.
As she waits for it to start, she slowly build starts up power. When she
talked about her powers earlier (at the Taste of Tokyo event)

she didn&#39;t say everything about it. She is a specific type of spell
caster. A SpellThrasher.

Unlike other magical disciplines, SpellThrashers use music in concert
with their spell casting for stronger and more potent effects. The music
ranges for each SpellThrasher, by taste and by the situation. For Eliza,
nothing else quite works for her when she&#39;s in attack mode (or training
mode) like hard and loud instrumental heavy/acid metal. No words, just
music,

because she doesn&#39;t like words. They throw her spell casting off.

For long seconds nothing, but it slowly begins to build and grow as the
music starts. For warm-ups she always uses a slow to start song,
something quiet and builds (as she builds power) to get her warmed up.

As she powers up she begins casting simple defense spells to prepare for
training.

Spellcasting for Spell Thrasher &amp; Guardian types come in two varieties.
Mental casting which require slight vocalization of spell names and
incantations requiring mental imagery of spell effects, and hasty spells
which require the quick short hand writing (with an air-writing

ring) combined with sharp verbal chants and vocalizations to trigger the
rune spell&#145;s effects.

Each had their own advantage and disadvantage in equal amounts. While
hasty spells are faster, they also tend to telegraph a caster&#39;s intent
from a mile away (and the caster needs to be highly literate as written
components of the spells often needed to be complex to trigger complex
spells). This meant the spell took several seconds to &quot;scratch&quot; out,
giving the intended target a chance to dodge or counter the spell (if
they were familiar with the runes that were being cast). The harder
mental casting takes a few more seconds, and more concentration, but
keeps spells hidden and &quot;under the table&quot; so they are less likely to be
countered by a rival SpellThrasher with a sharp attention span.

Eliza focuses the image of a small sphere inside of herself, and takes a
deep breath as she whispers &quot;Novashields.&quot; As she exhales, she imagines
the bubble expanding about her to form an unbreakable barrier between
herself and her targets, which goes up instantly and flawlessly.

As the music jacks into high gear, she slams her powers into overdrive
creating an &quot;aura burn&quot; (a powerful blast of energy with it&#39;s own
deflective properties) similar to what one might see in DBZ, for
instance. Quickly she scans the target &quot;range&quot; and waits for a target.

As one pops up she quickly snaps an arm out and fires off a quick spell
shot. Nothing fancy, just a quick shot of energy to snap the target in
half.

The second, third, fourth and fifth targets also fall just as easily,
with very little effort.

As the music fills her head and continues to jam and roar about her she
becomes more serious, flexing her right hand as she waits for several
targets to pop up at once. Quickly raising her hand into the air she
focuses her energy into it, forming a disc in the palm of her

hand, expanding it as she focuses.

&quot;Eviscerator Disc.&quot;

As she spins about she whirls the disc at one end of the targets, keeping
it&#39;s trajectory locked into her mind. As it spins to one side she quickly
yanks it across the room with her mind (and the guiding focus of her
right hand out, at all times aimed at the disc as it

moves) slashing the targets apart, shattering as the disc hit&#39;s the hard
spell-proof wall on the opposite end of the room.

As she waits for songs to change and a new song to begin she mildly
shoots off a few more shots, getting her timing right and the kinks out.

Nina was right. Taking some time every few days to come down here to give
her powers a workout was doing wonders for her. Ever since she started
doing it she&#39;s felt more energetic, and felt more active. She had been
sitting on her powers for too long since she got there, and let them
simmer as she watched Sakura do all the work, but this (now

that she was giving her powers a working) felt great! She didn&#39;t plan to
change her policy and try to outdo Sakura in Cardcaptoring, but she liked
the idea of giving her powers a bi-weekly workout. It felt liberating in
a sense.

As the music started again, loud and in her face, she thrust both arms
back abit (hands clenched) and began to power up, focusing all her energy
into her hands charging them. She clenched her teeth as she focused,
aiming dead center of the targets. &quot;GATTICA GUN!!&quot; With that she exhaled,
jamming her arms forward to unleash a bright roar of energy. The energy
shot forward, slashing through the middle target, obliterating the other
targets with the energy backlash as it hit the far wall. Suddenly the
energy bounced back, not dispersed like the Eviscerator disc as it hit
the anti-magic shell wall. Eliza smiled as

it came at her. &quot;REFLECT!&quot; She catches the energy on her shields, adding
energy to the shields to bounce the energy back. As it reflects, the
shields ripple where the blast hit (like water on a still pond when a
rock hit&#39;s the surface). The energy bounces off the

ceiling, into the far wall and back again. &quot;Better blast it before---&quot;

&quot;Eliza!!! Are you blaring that music through your skull ag---&quot; (Nina was
walking through the blast doors)

&quot;NINA?!?&quot;

The shot was powerful. Powerful enough to shatter the back barrier and
kill her. Quickly Eliza jumped forward bracing herself as she shot out
her energy in one shot to catch the &quot;gunshot&quot; in mid-flight. The two
colliding energies detonate and throw Eliza backwards, over the barrier,
and into Nina knocking both women out into the hallway.

Eliza, weary, sits up shaking her head as she shuts the music off
(removing the headset as she does). &quot;Nina? Sorry, I forgot to lock the
door again. I know you told me not to do that, and I could have gotten
you---&quot; (she stops, face faulting) &quot;---Nina?&quot;

&quot;---&quot; (Nina was in no condition to speak, her eyes were spinning and she
was sweat dropping while in a half conscious state, the world spinning as
she reeled from being bowled over by Eliza.) &quot;Uh boy. Nina? I&#39;m sorry!
I--- wanna go to the Medico Bay?&quot;

&quot;---&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take that as a yes.&quot; (Eliza quickly lugs Nina up on her shoulders,
crying as she rushes Nina to the Medico Bay) &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;ll
put that Do Not Disturb sign like you asked! I&#39;ll lock the door (I always
forget to do that) next time!&quot; (blushes) &quot;I&#39;ll even load that Lesbian
Cruise program you always wanted and we&#39;ll spend more time playing!
Alright?&quot;

&quot;Mphtpmaptham.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take that as you being happy--- I hope.&quot; (sweat drops). &quot;---hope
it&#145;s a friendly cruise---&quot;

* * * * * *

Meanwhile, back topside (in Sakura&#39;s class)

&quot;I heard Mr. Terada got married during Summer break.&quot;

&quot;Your kidding!&quot; Sakura couldn&#39;t believe her ears (obviously) &quot;To who,
Chiharu! Who?&quot;

Chiharu shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know. Everyone&#39;s hush-hush about it. But
he came back a few days ago so he could be here for the first day back so
I guess we&#39;ll find out soon.&quot;

Sakura walks over to Tomoyo as they talk about the latest gossip, &quot;Mr.
Terada did seem rather occupied during the past semester.&quot; Tomoyo noted,
&quot;I guess the pending wedding was distracting him. But I&#39;d like to know
who he got married to.&quot;

&quot;I know, Tomoyo, I know! It must be one of the teachers! Maybe the new
math teacher?&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;I don&#39;t think so. She&#39;s already married.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Oh. Then who?&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;Guess we&#39;ll find out--- oh, hi Rika.&quot;

&quot;Hi.&quot; (Rika, smiling from ear to ear, enters the class) &quot;How was summer
break for you two?&quot;

&quot;Nice. We saw movies and did shopping and stuff.&quot; Sakura beamed, looking
over at Rika&#39;s smiling face. &quot;You seem happy. Did you have fun during
break?&quot;

&quot;Is it that obvious? It was heaven. Very beautiful, and it&#39;ll only get
better each and every day. I know it will.&quot;

&quot;Phwee? What---&quot; (pointing at ring) &quot;You got a new ring? It&#39;s beautiful!
Where&#39;d you get it?&quot;

&quot;This?&quot; (Rika suddenly blushes as she fingers her new ring) &quot;It&#39;s a
commitment.&quot;

&quot;?&quot; (Sakura looks confused) &quot;Commitment?&quot; (blinks then facefaults) &quot;Oh by
the way, did you hear about Mr. Terada? He got...&quot;

&quot;Morning, everyone! Take your seats please!&quot; (Mr. Terada)

As everyone moves to their seats Sakura catches Mr. Terada &amp; Rika
exchanging glances, and smiles at each other. &#145;Rika must have been the
flower girl at Mr. Terada&#39;s wedding.&#39; Sakura thinks to herself, turning
her attention back to Mr. Terada. &#145;Have to ask her who Mr. Terada got
married to since she knows all the details.&#39;

&quot;Good morning everyone. Hope you had a good break. I have an announcement
to make. Today we have a new Student Teacher, she&#39;ll be teaching you
history while Mr. Tetsuo is on leave.&quot;

&quot;Strange timing for a leave of absence.&quot; Tomoyo remarks as everyone&#39;s
eyes turns towards the door, and Mr. Terada continues, &quot;So let&#39;s all give
her a warm welcome as she joins us for the first time today. You can come
in now---&quot;

As the door opens in walks a tall young woman. She has shoulder length
black hair, and a strong yet light build denoting both speed and
strength. Her eyes slowly pan the room examining everything, eventually
falling on Sakura and focusing on her exclusively, gaze locking in on
her.

&quot;This is Rebecca Summers. She&#39;s a local Tokyo-ite, she&#39;ll be teaching
history.&quot;

&quot;Sakura.&quot; (Tomoyo) &quot;Is it me or is the new history teacher staring at
you?&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Y-yeah--- I noticed.&quot;

Mr. Terada - &quot;Be nice to her, OK? We&#39;ll see you later then.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Rebecca remarks warmly, turning to leave, but not before
giving Sakura one last gaze. &quot;I&#39;ll treat them all like family.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;???&quot;

Tomoyo only smiled at the attention, &quot;I think the new teacher has a
fixation on you, Sakura.&quot;

If this was meant to comfort Sakura it didn&#145;t work. &quot;Oh, man.&quot;

* * * * * *

And, as it turns out, Rebecca&#39;s class is the last one of the day.

Sakura didn&#39;t know what was worst, the long lectures or the piercing
gazes she got from the teacher at times just because she was who she was
(Sakura).

&quot;In 1946 the Goddess of Judgments first assembled what we know today as
the Kamikaze Corps. The Corps, made entirely of redemption seeking
Japanese soldiers and officers when they were alive in the Waking World,
became a policing force against Darklings and rogue dreamers. Over time
they eventually found peace with themselves and their new world, and
began to make lives for themselves here. Mostly single men, they started
pairing off and eventually became fathers themselves.

This of course eventually lead to the 1975 Kamikaze Run incident in which
a former Corps. Lieutenant organized an strike team of old Corps members
after his daughter was kidnapped by darklings who sought to reestablish
the forbidden &quot;Comfort Women&quot; program. The &quot;program&quot; (as it were) which
ran during World War II in the waking world, was banned

in the Heavens&#39; Judgment Decrees of 1947 which forged the rules of
conduct that later became part of the basis of the Galactic Assassin
Guild&#145;s &quot;Code&quot; of conduct wherein---&quot; (bell) &quot;---and that&#39;s it for
today.&quot; (closes book) &quot;Tomorrow we&#39;ll touch on the Comfort Women
&quot;program&quot; and it&#145;s existence in several realities before, during and past
WWII, it&#39;s significance to the later Guardian Corps. We&#39;ll also talk
about it&#39;s eventual banning, and the subsequent &#145;75 Kamikaze Run incident
sparked by it&#39;s attempted revival for tomorrow&#39;s class. That&#39;s that so
everyone grab their gear and dismissed.&quot; (turns to Sakura) &quot;Can I see you
outside? I&#39;d like to chat with you.&quot;

Sakura face faults.

* * * * * *

&quot;Uuhh--- I was paying attention in class. Really--- ask me any---&quot;

Rebecca reaches into her top, pulling it open slightly to reveal a jet
black uniform top, &quot;If I didn&#39;t have to wear this annoying skirt I&#39;d have
my full uniform on...&quot; (as she brushes her hand across a jewel set into her
uniform a spark of energy leaps out, and forms into a

Glock in her hand. As she draws the gun forward she clicks the hammer
into place and points it right at Sakura, &quot;Alright let&#39;s make this short
and done with.&quot;

With that the gun flashed and cracked twice, the charges stopping midair
as Sakura&#39;s water ring sprung to life without warning, blocking the shots
with an impenetrable water globe that stopped the slugs short. Just as
quickly as it came, the shield dispersed... just leaving enough hints to
show that it could just as well reform again if need be.

Suddenly, with a slight hiss, she jumps back gun still at the ready. &quot;SO
IT&#39;S TRUE!

YOU ARE THE ONE! THAT RING... That&#39;d be the Water Ring I suppose, from the
reports.&quot;

Sakura, shellshocked, could only mutter &quot;W-what?!?&quot; as she stood there
shaking.

Rebecca snarled at her as she glared hatefully, &quot;What did you think!?
That you were above the law?? That you could run willy nilly and
everything would be forgiven because you&#39;re the savior who will protect
the world from the cards?!?&quot; (Rebecca&#39;s face darkened as she stares as
Sakura viciously, hand thrusted out) &quot;Fly card! Give it to me! NOW!!&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Buw h-how?&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;I know all about you already, you and your cards... including
the monster that imprisoned my lover! Tortured her! Molested her when she
was suffering the most, and nearly destroyed her!&quot; (Rebecca paced, but
not enough to waiver her gun&#39;s lock on Sakura) &quot;They all thought they
knew better than me! BETTER THAN ME! I just didn&#39;t have the last bits of
info I needed until now. They can&#39;t hide you from me anymore, the 5TH
JUDGMENT!! You and your perverted monsters are going to PAY for what you
did to her! PAY! Now, once again, give me Fly! Now!&quot;

Sakura shook her head as she tried to back away from Rebecca, &quot;No. I
can&#39;t. It&#39;s my responsibility to return them to Star cards.&quot;

PAKT! Rebecca shot again, to insure Sakura didn&#39;t try to run. The bullet
went wide, but made her point abundantly clear. &quot;And what makes you think
someone else can&#39;t do that?&quot; Rena

challenges, &quot;Your so full of yourself you can&#39;t possibly imagine someone
else is capable of doing your job, let alone doing it better! But it&#145;s
not like I care, I want that monster your hiding and I want it NOW!!&quot;

&quot;Fly is NOT a monster!&quot; Sakura protested, &quot;It was hurt! It didn&#39;t
understand! It didn&#39;t mean to hurt her! If you&#39;d only...&quot;

PAKT! (This shot was closer)

&quot;STOP TELLING ME WHAT I SHOULD OR SHOULDN&#39;T DO!!&quot; she shrieked in rage,
&quot;Such self importance! You really believe all that spiel that&#39;s been fed
into your head! What arrogance! That thing is a MONSTER and it should be
DESTROYED!!&quot; Rebecca quickly moves, grabbing Sakura&#39;s wrist hard. &quot;You
don&#39;t know what your DEALING WITH! I&#39;m the 5th DAMN JUDGEMENT and I want
THAT CARD RIGHT NOW!!!&quot;

&quot;NO!!&quot; Sakura cried, struggling as she knew Rebecca had just raised the
gun over her head, coming close to aiming it point blank at her, &quot;STOP!!
DON&#39;T!! PLEASE LET GO!!&quot;

Suddenly a blur rushes between them, grabbing by the uniform. &quot;STOP!! LET
HER GO!!&quot;

Rebecca lashes out, screaming as she knocks her attacker away with her
gunhand. As Sakura turns to look, her eyes go wide with shock as she
watches Tomoyo hit the ground near her, &quot;TOMO-CHAN!!&quot;

&quot;GIVE ME THAT--&quot;

Rebecca suddenly stops, her muscles seizing up as someone grabs her neck
from behind. With little effort, Keiko pulls Rebecca backwards, freeing
Sakura from her grasp. As she falls free, Sakura quickly rushes to
Tomoyo&#39;s side, crying. &quot;Tomo-chan! Are you hurt? Are

you OK? Tomo-chan!&quot;

Tomoyo, pulling herself to a sitting position, smiles as she gently
gathers Sakura into her strong arms hugging the distraught girl, &quot;I&#39;m
alright, Sakura-chan, don&#39;t cry...&quot; (pulls the teary-eyed Sakura into her
arms) &quot;Just as long as your safe... that&#39;s all that matters... please don&#39;t
cry...&quot;

Keiko, however, was angry beyond words as she spun Rebecca around and
stared at her only to get the gun shoved into her face in turn.

Keiko - &quot;Never EVER touch Sakura or Tomoyo again! NEVER!!&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;Bitch!&quot;

Rebecca suddenly grabs Keiko&#39;s arm, using Keiko&#39;s strong grip and steady
arm to give herself enough leverage to swing her knee up and into Keiko&#145;s
body, who barely manages to deflect the blow knocking both Judgments
apart. As they gather their wits Keiko draw her blade as Rebecca aims
again with her gun. &quot;Somebody should have told you not to take a butter
knife to a gunfight!&quot; she yelled.

Keiko wasn&#145;t backing down so easily, &quot;I don&#39;t know what the hell you
think your doing, whore, but I&#39;m going to make you regret crossing me!&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;I don&#39;t have time for you. Get out of my way, or do you now
coddle and support monsters and woman rapers now?!?&quot;

Keiko frowned, &quot;What the hell are you ramblin--&quot;

&quot;LUNCH!! HEY YOU TWO WE GOT LUNCH!!&quot; (Eve &amp; a strangely familiar elf girl
jumps over the fence to meet the two)

Keiko - &quot;---Eve?!?&quot;

Rebecca facefaults, &quot;Trinny?!?&quot;

As both girls step between them the two stare at them oddly.

Rebecca - &quot;Trinny I thought you were spending the day with your cousin!&quot;

She didn&#145;t stop for a second, quickly the elf advanced right on Rebecca
and slapped her hard, her hand then quickly yanks the gun from her hand
and pulls Rebecca in close. Shocked, Rebecca could only stare teary eyed
into her lover&#145;s face.

&quot;Don&#145;t do this.&quot;

Rebecca&#145;s body trembled, &quot;S-sh-she hurt you... that...&quot;

Trinity shook her head, &quot;I hurt myself. I broke our wedding vows of my
own free will.&quot; (Rebecca shook her head and cried &quot;no&quot; over and over
softly as Trinity spoke, &quot;I went out and slutted around with men like a
twobit whore because I was weak. I prostituted myself and shamed myself
and...&quot; (shakes Rebecca) &quot;Stop it! Stop making excuses for me! I did that
and I can&#39;t let you do this because of my weakness!&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;It&#39;s HER! IT&#39;S HER! SHE DID IT!!&quot; (struggles to break free of
Trinity but slowly weakens in her grip) &quot;Stop forgiving her! She did it...
she did it...&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; she said again, &quot;I did it. I did it...&quot; (Rebecca &amp; Trinity both hug
each other crying) &quot;Why won&#145;t you stop holding me on such high regards!!
I don&#145;t deserve it!&quot;

For all watching, nothing could be said as they watched silently.

* * * * * *

Back at the Daidouji estates Tomoyo made herself and Sakura dinner up in
Sakura&#39;s &quot;lab&quot;.

It took awhile for them to recover from the incident after school, now
they were really hungry after all the lying in bed and hugging and
comforting.

Sakura - &quot;Did you talk to Nina about the new teacher?&quot; (gulps) &quot;She isn&#39;t
going to threaten to kill me everyday is she?&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;Keiko promises she&#39;ll not do that again, she and her lover had
a long talk and they eventually came to an understanding. As for Nina?
She didn&#39;t pick up. She must be working late and fell asleep.&quot;

Sakura sighs, &quot;And she has the nerve to call me Snoozer all the time.&quot;
(picks up a pocky stick and chews on it) &quot;She&#39;ll probably remember to
call when we&#39;re all sleeping.&quot;

Suddenly Nina, stuffing her face with snacks, walks into the kitchen.
&quot;Hey.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Hello, sleepy head. Have a good nap?&quot;

Nina - &quot;I was working so get off my back Snoozer.&quot;

&quot;Your Snoozer, Snoozer. And some work too---&quot; Sakura snipped back,
relishing in this one chance she got to get on Nina&#39;s back and have a
good reason for doing so. But that quickly faded as she realized what she
wanted to talk about. &quot;DO YOU KNOW A WOMAN NAMED REBECCA SUMMERS?!?&quot;

That just about puts Nina on her butt and shaves a few months off her
life (from the shock). Nina frowns, dusts herself off, and sits down in a
chair (still eating) &quot;What she look like? Describe her.&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;According to the records she is the 5th Judgement, as stated.&quot; Nina
remarks as she chews on dinner, &quot;Elfgirl lover who you met, because she
was the one imprisoned in Fly when we caught it. Short fuse temper, has
been written up several times by the Judgement Corps for excessive force.
Instead of using a blade she employs a pair of custom spell-scribed
Glocks (the infamous &quot;plastic guns&quot;) which have the same invincibility
runes scrolled into the metal like Keiko&#39;s katana (which makes it
unbreakable) while the gun seems to fire an unlimited amount of either
normal ArmorBreakers or &quot;SpellAirius&quot; spellbreaker ammo that can harm
magical entities (like Fly).&quot; (Nina sighs) &quot;Having her on your enemies
list is not a good thing.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; (Tomoyo, speaking up for the first time this conversation as she &amp;
Sakura ate)

&quot;She&#39;s a horribly disfunctional personality according to records. Once
she is hellbent on something she doesn&#39;t let up. She...&quot; (sighs) &quot;...didn&#39;t
try anything crazy with you, did she?&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;She tried to put a bullet through Sakura&#39;s head. But Keiko said
she gotten over that and is going to leave Sakura alone.&quot;

Nina - &quot;Good luck. She might not be trying to kill Sakura anymore but
that won&#39;t mean she&#39;ll let the topic of Fly go, not by a long shot. She&#145;s
going to find a way to get Fly even if it kills her, you&#145;ll see.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;BUT DOES THAT MEAN SHE&#39;S GOING TO DESTROY FLY?!? WHAT DO I DO??
WHAT IF SHE TRIES TO HURT TOMOYO TO GET TO FLY??&quot;

Nina blinks, &quot;Your full of punch today, guess I can&#145;t blame you since
somebody tried to blow your non-existant brains out of your empty head.&quot;
(sighs at the lack of reaction from Sakura) &quot;Tomoyo is safe. Her elfgirl
lover will not forgive Rebecca if she murdered in her name so she&#39;s going
to keep her violence to Fly alone. Tomoyo won&#39;t be harmed.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;R-r-really?&quot;

Nina - &quot;Sure. She&#39;ll probably just pick your pocket and shove Fly into a
paper shredder, or burn it in an incinerator or...&quot; (sighs) &quot;...and from the
sad sad face on you I bet I shouldn&#39;t have said all that.&quot; Nina opens the
fridge (having stood up to pace while Tomoyo calmed Sakura down again) &quot;I
guess the only thing you can do is appeal to this elfgirl lover of her&#39;s,
and convince her that Fly is harmless. Once you do that she&#39;ll convince
Rebecca and problem solved. Rebecca has no desire to alienate her lover,
and if her lover is convinced Fly is harmless then Rebecca will be
convinced.&quot; (waves hand) &quot;Anyway I heard Keiko mention something about
Rebecca ranting that you weren&#39;t the one for the cardcaptoring thing.
Don&#39;t listen to her, it&#39;s your destiny to reseal those cards. Only you,
the one who originally did the deed in the past, can do this job. Nobody
else is up to it, and not even the most powerful amongst the Guardian
classes can do this job. This is specifically your task, and the cards
already have your name on them (twice) so they know you.&quot; (points at
Cr?me Brulle in her hands) &quot;Just like this piece of food product is a job
only I can undertake. Nobody else is up to the task of eating this...&quot;
(smiles) &quot;...under penalty of death.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;I put Tomoyo&#39;s name on them too.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Nina&#39;s face frowns, &quot;Not on my Cr?me Bru--&quot; (looks) &quot;...oh, wait,
you mean the cards don&#39;t you...&quot; (sighs) &quot;Do they listen to her too now?&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Yes.&quot;

Nina thinks for a second, &quot;That&#39;s not surprising. You two are deeply in
love. The cards pick up on that depth of affection and simply &quot;adopted&quot;
Tomoyo as their surrogate &quot;mistress&quot; along with yourself, and are willing
to obey her as well as you because you two are so close.&quot;

Tomoyo looks at Sakura in a bit of confusion, &quot;So your saying I can use
the Clow cards?&quot;

Nina - &quot;Once they&#39;re sealed? Yeah. You already helped Sakura use the
sealing staff once with Shadow / Fear so it makes sense that you can use
the cards. They love Sakura, and she loves you, so it&#39;s natural the cards
would transfer that chain into their expressing love to you as Sakura
(who they love) loves you in turn. You understand?&quot;

&quot;----&quot; (Sakura looks perplexed by the ramblings of Nina)

&quot;You&#39;re the one who said she could use the cards yet look so &quot;deer in
headlights&quot;-ish when I try to explain the specifics of it. Never mind.&quot;
(Nina sits down, Cr?me Brulle in hand) &quot;So how did Rebecca find you
anyway?&quot;

Sakura - &quot;?!?&quot; (blanks out) &quot;She never said.&quot;

&quot;Ogh. That&#39;s bad.&quot; (Nina leans back taking a sip) &quot;It&#39;s bad enough when
they brag and show their magical wears, but to completely keep her
methods silent like that is troublesome. It&#39;s not like we filed a ton of
reports with your physical address or anything making it easy to hunt you
down... she must have used her clout as the 5th Judgement to get into
Government records to find your whereabouts (and the fact you were
connected to the cards).&quot;

Sakura - &quot;But--- the first time the Clow cards were released there was
this whole thing about a great disaster. I didn&#39;t like how things almost
ended the first time because of the cards---&quot; (looks sad) &quot;---it won&#39;t
happen again, will it? Will--- I DON&#39;T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT!!&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;Sakura-chan---&quot;

Sakura - &quot;I DON&#39;T WANT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH TOMOYO ONLY TO LOSE HER!!&quot;

Tomoyo slides up next to Sakura, gently taking the distraught girl into
her arms as she rocks her beloved&#39;s fears away. &quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere.
I&#39;m right here--- I won&#39;t leave you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s probably nothing like that.&quot; Nina remarks, &quot;Events like that only
happen once. They&#39;re tied directly into situations that happened the
first time around, so there won&#39;t be a repeat of those things again.
Anyway you found your love with Tomoyo at your darkest hour, right? You
won&#39;t lose it no matter what happens.&quot;

&quot;Thank god!&quot; (Sakura hugs Tomoyo as both girls pat each other on the
backs)

&quot;Now---&quot; (intercom goes off) &quot;---what&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Doorbell. Somebody&#39;s here.&quot; (Tomoyo)

&quot;I&#39;ll go check it out.&quot; Nina stands up and heads out the door. As she
walks downstairs to the door Nina&#39;s features turn graven, &quot;On the other
hand--- if THEY get involved things could be more complicated than any of
us could even imagine---&quot; (sighs) &quot;Alright! Alright! I&#39;m here!!&quot; (clicks
on security monitor) &quot;Don&#39;t get your panties in a bunch! Now let&#39;s
see---&quot; (looks at image) &quot;Eliza? Sheesh.&quot; (opens door) &quot;Eliza! You have
the key, why didn&#39;t you let yourself in? Come here silly---&quot; Nina gives
Eliza a hug. &quot;You had me worried! I thought it was a door-to-door
salesman or something! I---&quot;

SHRRICCKK!

Nina&#39;s eyes go wide, her limbs stiffen abit. She leans against Eliza as
she looks down, and notices the blade sticking through her side. &quot;----&quot;

With a thrust of one hand Eliza throws Nina back, watching the girl slam
into the floor, breath escaping as she is knocked senseless.

&quot;Nina? Whose down there? Ni---&quot;

Sakura stops at the foot of the stairs as Eliza turns on her, sword in
hand, Nina lying before her holding onto her side as she slowly bleeds on
the floor.</pre>
