<h1>Love Forever (part 6 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Tomoyo returned to see Sakura sleeping peacefully. She crawled into bed 
beside her and held her close.

&quot;Good night Sakura-chan.&quot; She whispered into her ear.

&quot;Hanyaaaaann.&quot; Said Sakura while blushing and smiling.

Tomoyo giggled and drifted off to sleep.

Sakura awoke to the sound and smell of Tomoyo cooking breakfast. She 
quickly jumped out of bed and headed for the kitchen. She stopped dead 
in her tracks and stared as she got goosebumps at seeing Tomoyo clad 
only in light green panties and an apron.

&quot;She&#39;s pretty sexy isn&#39;t she Sakura-chan?&quot; Asked Sonomi. Startling 
Sakura out of her trance. Sakura blushed and looked away.

&quot;You&#39;re right Tomoyo! Sakura-chan is just so cute when she&#39;s 
embarassed!&quot;

&quot;I know! Said Tomoyo while putting her hand to her cheek.

Sonomi led Sakura over to an empty seat at the table and asked her to 
sit. Tomoyo came in a short time later and put breakfast on the table.

&quot;I told mother that you came back and she was delighted! She wanted to 
surprise you by coming over this morning. I told her about last night 
and she agreed that having Touya or Yukito as a donor was better than 
going to a clinic.&quot;

&quot;Umm.... about that. Last night, while you were in the tub, I talked to 
the Sakura cards about it. I&#39;ve been neglecting them lately by not 
giving them updates on how things are going with my life and loved ones. 
I appologized and told them about us and how we wanted to have a baby. 
They were thrilled at the idea and gave me their full support.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s great! So even the Sakura cards are happy for you two!&quot; Sonomi 
cried. 

She found out about the cards after Sakura left for Hong Kong. Sonomi 
found Tomoyo crying in her room one night while watching a video of 
Sakura capturing the Power card and asked how Tomoyo made such beautiful 
special effects. Tomoyo said that Sakura was a magical person and she 
didn&#39;t need special effects to do things like that. Sonomi watched the 
video with her daughter as she explained about the clow cards and 
Kero-chan.

&quot;I told them that I wanted to do something special and that I needed 
their help. I&#39;m sorry Tomoyo-chan, but having someone&#39;s sperm put into 
you just doesn&#39;t seem right. I asked them to give all of their energy 
into helping me and they did. Tomoyo-chan, I think it worked. I think... 
no. I hope I&#39;m pregnant.&quot;

&quot;What! But how!? You need a guy, or, at least his sperm to get 
pregnant... don&#39;t you?&quot; Asked Sonomi.

&quot;That&#39;s right! I thought we were going to get Yukito or your brother to 
help us!?&quot;

Sakura told them what she did and Tomoyo got upset.

&quot;I thought that we didn&#39;t decide who was going to carry the baby!? What 
if something went wrong? What if you got hurt!?&quot;

&quot;Exactly... what if something did go wrong Tomoyo? What if I used my 
magic on you and you got hurt? I would never forgive myself if I ended 
up hurting you! It&#39;s my magic after all. I don&#39;t know how it would have 
reacted with you. I thought, since it&#39;s my own magic, it would be better 
if I used it on myself rather than risk hurting you Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

Sakura looked down at the floor timidly as her eyes started to swell. 
Tears flowed down her cheeks and fell to the floor.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Sakura-chan. I didn&#39;t mean to upset you.&quot; Said Tomoyo while 
falling to her knees beside Sakura. She reached out and pulled Sakura 
into a warm hug. 

&quot;Sakura-chan... How exactly did you get yourself pregnant without 
sperm?&quot; Asked Sonomi.

Sakura reached into her pocket and pulled out a Sakura card. She handed 
it to Sonomi and told her to turn it over. Sonomi gasped when she saw 
the image on the other side.

&quot;Nadeshiko!?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I thought when I first saw her.&quot; Said Tomoyo. Sakura 
blushed as she looked at the card with them.

&quot;This is what I used to get myself pregnant. I poured all of my hope 
into it and so did the rest of the cards. Deep down inside, I feel as 
though my mother did too. Whether she&#39;s watching us from heaven, or 
whether she&#39;s really the hope that&#39;s in that card, it doesn&#39;t matter to 
me. All I know is I&#39;m glad I did it.&quot;

Sakura blushed and put a hand on her stomach. Tomoyo and Sonomi looked 
at each other and then glomped Sakura in a tight bear hug.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe it! I&#39;m going to be a mommy!&quot; Yelled Tomoyo.

&quot;And I&#39;m going to be a grandmother!&quot; Sonomi cried, kind of happy and 
kind of dreadfully.

&quot;You don&#39;t sound to thrilled mother.&quot;

&quot;I am! It&#39;s just... the thought of me being a grandmother kind of makes 
me... it makes me feel kind of...&quot;

&quot;Old?&quot; Sakura innocently says.

&quot;Ah...um...*cough*...&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Sonomi sighs, dropping her head.

Tomoyo and Sakura giggled as Sonomi blushed and tried to regain her 
composure.

&quot;Sakura... you don&#39;t have a job yet do you?&quot;

&quot;No... not yet.&quot;

&quot;Hmmmm.&quot; Sonomi says while rubbing her chin. &quot;I know!&quot; Sonomi leans over 
and whispers into Tomoyo&#39;s ear. Tomoyo looks back at Sakura and laughs.

&quot;Hoe?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve just had a wonderful idea!&quot; Said Sonomi while Tomoyo was trying 
not to giggle.

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I like where this is going. Knowing you two, it&#39;ll 
probably end up with me getting very embarassed and then some.&quot;

&quot;Well... kind of. Tomoyo and I have been trying to think of something 
new to put out this fall, and with you being pregnant, I think we&#39;ve 
found it.&quot;

Sakura got a concerned look and sweatdropped at the tone in Sonomi&#39;s 
voice.

&quot;I&#39;d like to offer you a job Sakura. If you want it that is.&quot;

&quot;Really? Wait... what kind of job?&quot;

Sonomi and Tomoyo got a miscievious look and answered at the same time.

&quot;Modeling of course!&quot;

&quot;Hoeeeeee!?&quot;

&quot;We want you to be a model for our new line of clothes. We want to 
release a line of clothes for plus sized people and even some Maternity 
wear.&quot;

&quot;Sakura-chan would look super cute in them!&quot; Yelled Tomoyo.

&quot;Thank You Sonomi-san.&quot; Sakura said while bowing as low as she could. 
&quot;I&#39;d love to work for you. I hope I can live up to your expectations.&quot;
