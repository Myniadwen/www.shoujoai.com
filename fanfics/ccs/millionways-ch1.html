<h1>A Million Ways</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/wdv.html">WdV</a><br> </h2>
<p>	Tomoyo stirred, blinked her eyes to clear them but that’s hard to do while lying 
down with tears running over her soft cheeks, down to her pillow already wet. She set up 
real quick to get her sleepy unbalance to go away. First thing she did was look left to 
Sakura lying there so peaceful and undisturbed by her sudden movement. She knew Sakura was 
tired from her hard Athletic program work outs for the last three weeks now.</p>
<p> 	</p>
<p>	Looking at Sakura, Tomoyo thought to herself, Sakura had become the top Gymnast 
around and probably most of Japan after Friday I’m sure and I‘m so proud of her. I have 
become a model, a dress designer and I still sing and play the piano for most of the Music 
festivals around by demand so we do keep ourselves busy most of the time. We are happy to be 
together, even she said that so why am I always crying anymore? She wiped her tears to dry. 
Her tears had almost stopped on their own by now. </p>

<p>	I guess it’s just me crying because she always seems so happy anymore. Why can’t I 
just tell her, we’ve always told each other everything that’s in our lives, well other than 
that? She even told me why she broke with Li way back then but it was nothing I hadn’t 
already guessed though. She came to my house after their date as mad as I’ve ever seen her. 
Sakura Said, “that stupid no good egotistical excuse for a male, he thinks he’s gods gift to 
woman. Tomoyo he had his hands all over me and I don’t like touched by anyone. I told him NO 
but he kept on so I used the Windy card and blew him clear across the park. Probably wake up 
in the hospital somewhere. I never want to see him again or anyone else with hands on my 
body, ever. I don’t need a guy if that’s the way all of them are.”  I tried to convince her 
that all boys weren’t that way but I didn’t try too hard though. </p>

<p>	Still in thought, Tomoyo remembers more of the past. That’s when I thought I might 
still have a chance with her but she said she didn’t want touched by anyone and from that 
time until now even after we started living together over three years ago we have not 
touched in that manner but It’s not because I don’t want too, I don’t want to lose her 
forever and I’m afraid that would happen. In the last three years we do bathe together, wash 
a little on the other if ask but we are adults now with nothing to hide by looking. We know 
each others body by heart, well to look at anyway. We do kiss a quick peck on each others 
lips and we go to our separate colleges and usually come home together like in grade and 
high school but that’s all we’ve done and that’s not even in the realm of love, Yes I love 
her so much but I can’t tell her and she’s not shown me any sign either. Are we just 
destined to live together forever and that’s all?</p>

<p>	I look at her there so peaceful to the world and I’m dying over here for her, just 
to touch her perfect body, an athletics dream but if she woke, I don’t want to think of 
that. All I can see is her beauty and right now how lucky for me, her body is twisted some 
and her silk night gown is pulled way tight back to one side. This makes her right breast 
and that cute little nub in the center stand out almost erect from the pull of her gown. 
That is one of the most beautiful sights that I’ve seen from her in a long while. It is so 
erect and begging to be tasted with my lips but I can’t, not ever unless she gives me a sign 
she would accept it or at least from me anyway, her best friend, God if she only knew?</p>

<p>	I have to look away, my heart is pounding in my throat and chest, and it’s getting 
hard to focus on anything but her beside me, why does she have to punish me this way? I told 
her many times when we were younger that I loved her and I’d tell her more when we were 
older but she never heard that or has forgotten about it. So here she is so beautiful beside 
me and I’m over here alone without her in my arms.</p>

<p>	I have to change my thoughts or I just might attack her here and now but I just 
can’t lose her.</p>
<p>I start thinking of other things, mainly the song that woke me a while ago. I’ve heard it 
a few times on the radio and know most of the words and to my surprise the song lyrics are 
close to my feelings for her, if I could only get her to listen to it then she’d know for 
sure but how do I get her to listen to it?</p>
<p> 	</p>
<p>	Tomoyo still thinking about something Sakura has said earlier, she doesn’t like 
music anymore as it makes her think of him, Li. Not love for him but she gets an evil 
expression ever time she hears his name and believe me when she gets mad at someone, she’s 
mad. I thought about getting the CD and when she’s asleep that night, play it on repeat all 
night long but very low and soft. Maybe she’ll remember some of it in the morning and 
finally realize what it means. She’s got three days before her big meet so if I can get it 
tonight or tomorrow night, that will give her time to at least think about it but will it 
upset her at the most important meet ever? That’s my only hope now though, I’ve got to try 
that no matter the outcome now, I‘m dying more each day without her closer to me and she 
doesn‘t know it.</p>

<p>	Finally Tomoyo lies back down to get some sleep but have one last look at her Sakura 
and all her beauty and turns quickly so she doesn’t do a little nibbling on that perfect 
chest anyway.</p>

<p>	The next morning they got out of bed as usual, bathed together and clothed for their 
day at school and practice. Tomoyo fixed them breakfast as Sakura read the sports page for 
competition at her meet. They finally got the meal out of the way and put on jackets for the 
cool weather. Before they went outside in the cool morning breeze, they did their usual peck 
on the lips kiss and exited their apartment. They walked together for a couple of blocks and 
went both directions at the corner. </p>

<p>	Tomoyo knew what she had to do before anything else this day, get that CD and she 
run into the closest music store to purchase it. The CD that she hopped would shake Sakura’s 
memory and think if she could with everything else going on in her life right now with 
gymnastic workouts and the upcoming meet. She went on to her class but thought most of the 
day about how exactly she could make the lyrics go with their situation but it almost did 
anyway. She wrote the first line down to examine, </p>

<i><p>	</p></i>( I woke up in the strangest dream to a world that I’ve seen for so long 
----------long )
<i><p>	</p>

<p>	</p></i>Tomoyo in deep thought this time, That’s easy, even this morning I woke to 
this verse but to me it means that I always dreamed of Sakura and I capturing cards 
together, her capturing the card and I capturing her and the card capture on video. We’ve 
always worked together so perfectly and sometimes that in it’s self was scary but I’ve seen 
it and dreamed it for so long now. Its part of our past lives together.
<p> </p>
<p>	Past lives because after Sakura did get all the cards, Kero sealed the book again 
for when ever the next one opens it again and the circle starts all over again with the next 
card captor. There has been only one with so much Mage power, Sakura, the most powerful Mage 
ever. Sakura is no longer a card captor but still has her mage power that overwhelms even 
the professionals. She’ll never lose that as that was born into her from birth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	( Fallen angel spoke with me   with her open wings, she said come on --------come on 
)</p>
<p>	 <i> </i>      </p>
<p>	Thinking again, A few times Sakura did get knocked down but right back up and 
hollering for me to come on. She wouldn’t leave me behind because of the danger of me being 
there alone and I didn’t want her to go alone either even though I certainly couldn’t 
protect her with any magic power like her. All I could do was video her action with my 
camera. Afterwards we would go over the tape to see how she could have improved on the 
capture but improvement wasn’t very often. </p>

<p>              ( An I can’t stop this fever---liberty comes over me and -------</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Tomoyo still in thought, I get overwhelmed with excitement every time I think I can 
just go home and tell her, open up my feelings and let it all out but when I get there I see 
her beauty setting there and if I tell her, will she leave me forever and I be alone the 
rest of my life? I couldn’t take that so I just set beside her, put my arm around her 
shoulder and ask her about her day. I’m such a chicken; I’ll never be able to tell her that 
way so maybe this song will do what I can’t.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>              ( There’s a million ways I’ve tried ---To say these words to you for so 
long -------long )</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Got to be close to a million, fifty plus thoughts an hour when I’m awake for ten 
years I’ve tried to figure a way to tell her. It’s not fair, I’m so stupid for not just 
telling her and it’ll be over, but I love her too much to hurt her if she can’t accept it 
the way I really mean it. So I set and watch her from a far never to touch her. Yes we’re 
together but that’s not complete and fulfilling love.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>             ( Hundred million stars that shine but you’re the only one that I want 
-------want )</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Sakura is my only love and always will be, Sakura can’t you see I want you so bad 
it’s hurting me more all the time anymore that you don’t see me as I really am.</p>

<p>             ( Every passing moment can’t you see that there’s a Million Ways Tonight ) 
</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	So many nights after a capture I could see her eyes sparkle, then she looked at me 
and I just know she wanted me to say something other than “Great Capture Sakura” Is she 
wanting me to make the first move, I know my move isn’t what she’s expecting or I don’t 
think anyway. She’d hate me for sure then.</p>

<p>             ( Angel take me by the hand --help me understand what I’ve learned 
-------learned )</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Even though Sakura was the most beautiful young girl in the world, after she got all 
the cards, even Li’s cards too, he was so mad that he stomped off and never returned to that 
life as a card captor. She also acquired the wings of a goddess which made her the angel of 
angels and I almost died every time her wings were open, no words to describe her beauty 
there. </p>

<p>	Thinking back to the one night after another captor her flight ended right next to 
me, her wings shined so brightly that she lit up the area like the noon sun. Then she took 
my hand in hers and her arms and wings wrapped around me, she just held me tight for a 
minute then ask if I understood just what she was trying to tell me also back all these 
years, just what have you learned from videoing me? I was so shocked that I don’t believe I 
answered her at all. Actually I didn’t know what she meant, couldn’t be what I’ve been 
trying to tell her or could it? She had surprised me a lot then but surely it wasn’t that 
reason.</p>

<p>             ( Every woman and every man has a precious seed that they burned  ---burned 
---burned )</p>

<p>	</p>
<p>	Still thinking about the past, maybe everyone has a want to do something out of the 
ordinary and it just happened that my mother, Sonomi and Sakura’s mother Nadeshiko had a 
love affair that not many knew about and they were happy I’ve been told but things happen. 
When Sakura’s mother died suddenly, my mother almost died too. After a month in the hospital 
and finally faced the real world again she was sad but did go on with her life, had to. For 
many people life don’t always turn out the way they’d like, ask me, I know full well now. 
Many start with the wrong partner, some with other things in mind than a good marriage but 
even if Sakura did love me the same way, could we get married? That’s almost a No-No here in 
Japan anyway.</p>

<p>            ( An I can’t stop this fever ----liberty comes over me and ----)</p>
<p>	</p>

<p>	Tomoyo thinks this a little different than before, Stop this fever, this desire for 
her, no way. I have to come out and tell her somehow but I’m so stupid, I should have done 
these years ago as it is.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>             ( There’s a million ways I’ve tried ---to say these words to you for so long 
------long )</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Tomoyo thinks hard this time, well if I could tell her in the song, so many ways 
I’ve wanted to say these words to you Sakura and for so long. I’m even starting to doubt 
myself that I can tell her now. But maybe I have a chance with the song now? I still may 
have a last chance. When I contacted the Athletics board about me entertaining at the events 
closing, all I got was please do so now I have 2 days to work up this piece without Sakura 
hearing me somehow. Maybe I’ll just make an excuse to go visit mom a little so I can 
practice some piano music to go with the lyrics. My school just let out early so I’ll go 
home and leave Sakura a note where I am if she beats me there but I don’t think she will, 
been practicing late for two weeks now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            ( Hundred million stars that shine ---but you’re the only one that I want 
-----want )</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	There may be a lot guys out there that may like me but there’s only one person that 
I want to want me, Sakura. I’ll just look at another verse or two while I’m walking to our 
apartment.</p>

<p>            ( I can’t wait forever --time is running out --an I can’t wait forever --your 
life is running down )</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Tomoyo begins to think again of these words now, my feelings here. I can’t wait 
forever, if I can’t tell her at her final meet here local and she does progress on up, 
she’ll probably go elsewhere to train and my time is running out to tell her. The part right 
behind that one, an I can’t wait forever, again I have to make my move and at her meet as 
well, the last part is a little different but I think, If I don’t tell her or her tell me 
even if she has these same feelings, we’ll drift apart and I’ll take over our business and 
Sakura will most certainly advance much further in all sports, athletics or anything she 
sets her mind to do but by that we’ll just drift further apart and our live we have now will 
be behind us and forgotten. Her closeness is running down. I have to do something to stop 
that and this song had better work. </p>

<p>	Well I just got home and I’ll leave her my note but I’ll be back here before she 
gets back anyway. I’m going to moms and practice myself now Sakura for the performance of my 
life, the performance of our future lives I pray. I’ll read the rest while I’m walking to 
moms.</p>

<p>             ( Come on now -- come on now-- come on now --come on now------------          
(13 times)  )</p>

<i>
<p>	</p></i>Tomoyo reads and thinks, the many come on now’s would qualify as me trying 
to get her to come on now, we got to get home and get our homework done but in reality I 
just wanted her alone and to myself mostly, I’m a little selfish when it comes to Sakura to 
the other girls but mostly guys before Li. After Li went a flying in the park from Sakura’s 
windy card his last night to date her, well she don’t much like guys and I had her more to 
myself but even that wasn’t enough to make her mine, I still couldn’t tell her.

<p>	The last two verses are a repeat twice of the second verse and not much different in 
meaning.</p>

<p>            ( There’s a million ways I’ve tried ----To say these words to you for so long 
------long )</p>
<p>            ( Hundred million stars that shine ----But you’re the only one that I want 
--------want )</p>
<p>             </p>
<i><p>	</p></i>Then these lyrics over again and that’s it, I should be able to work that up 
real quick, I will for the love of Sakura if she understands it that is. But she had better 
or my next move is drastic, very drastic.


<p>	 At my moms now in my old room at my piano and have run through it a few times 
already and I think I can get combine notes just enough to make it sound a lot like the 
original groups music. If I can keep the beat up, it should make a good comparison anyway. 
Well I’d better get home and fix a good meal for her. </p>

<p>	With Sakura going to bed early and sleeps like a log here lately, tonight and 
tomorrow night I’ll play the CD. I fear for her and her body’s over exhaustion but it’ll be 
over for a while this Friday, Locally anyway for a while. </p>

<p>	Well I’m back at home now but things are a little strange, looks like Sakura came 
home early and fixed herself something to eat and cleaned up after. Looks like she is in bed 
already, I’ll bet she’s tired tonight but I’ve got to check on her, pray that she’s Ok. I’ll 
go to the bed room and check, hope she’s just tired. I walk in and get on my knees beside, 
pat her on I hope is her head in this bundle of covers and over her head and softly asks, 
“Sakura are you alright little one?” now I think what a choice of words, she’s anything but 
little with her muscular body anymore, Gee. </p>

<p>	Sakura pulls the blanket back and smiles up to Tomoyo, said, “Yes and thanks for 
asking beautiful lady. We just had a very good but tiring day and she sent us home early to 
get more rest for Friday and I sure need it too.”</p>

<p>	Tomoyo smiled down at her and said, “Good, if you’re Ok, I’ll let you rest more by 
going back to mom’s and work on a little music I’ve been ask to perform at a place here soon 
and I better get to it for that person. You rest lady and I’ll work on my music then.” </p>

<p>	Tomoyo thinking again, Well before I leave for mom’s again tonight, I did get the CD 
set up for replay for about 5 hours starting at about 12 to 5 AM so that should go well. 
When I get back to bed I’ll listen too for words, music, and practice timings. </p>
<p>------------------------------<WBR>------------------------------<WBR>---------</p>
<p>	Tomoyo sets back to think how fast the last day and a half have gone by, or where it 
went more like it at Friday’s big meet and with Sakura almost finished with even better than 
we had hoped with almost all double marks on everything. She’s setting the individual’s 
total marks so high that no one else is even in her ball park. We did take a quick snack 
break or what she could intake for the last event coming up in about 2 hours. </p>

<p>	I smiled at her and ask, “You are just Sakura here with us all today aren’t you 
young lady? I mean no magic right? You’ve just set the highest scores in all of your events 
ever you know? Are you Ok love? Sorry I know you’re not but you’re so good at everything now 
and I’m so proude of you my sweety. I have to go now and get ready for my little play here 
shortly but I’ll be back in time for your last event so I better hurry,” Ok as I reached 
down and squeezed Sakura‘s soft but strong hand for good luck and left quickly.</p>

<p>	Back stage and out of sight from Sakura anyway I started on what I had to do to get 
ready with the piano and a small synthisizer that I finaly broke down and baught for beat 
and sound I tried but just couldn’t duplicate with time so short. Everything was set and 
ready to move onto the stage when ready. I had already given the announcer his paperwork 
earlier so things were set here.</p>

<p>	The final contestants were called for the last floor event and I showed my suport to 
her out in front so she would know I was there for her again and the exersize went on to the 
end with no surprises to us anyway, Sakura tenned everything so it just raised her overall 
total even higher. While all the crowds and reporters were around Sakura, that give me time 
to get back stage unseen and ready everything for the curtains to part after her awards just 
on the other side of the cloth wall here. My piano and my synthesizes were set up, and I 
will be rowled out on this short flat and wired for sound when ready. </p>

<p>	The announcer congratulated all the contestants and winners and awards were handed 
out to everyone and presented them all to the audance for all to see and cheer on.</p>

<p>	 When I do any live performances anywhere anymore I always have all four of my boby 
guards around me somewhere close so we were all ready to go out on the main stage when qued. 
</p>
<p>	My body guards are very young and beautiful ladies with the two (April and May) out 
front usually which are real partners in life and love and don’t mind everyone knowing it 
either. They’re in each others arms all the time. That and them alone should encourage me to 
tell Sakura but I’m still afraid she won’t understand what I’ve wanted to tell her for years 
but always said I’ll wait until we‘re older. My other two guards, first is (June) and 
usually back a ways behind me and has all the weapons if they should ever need any but not 
too often for these girls, the best we could find in all of Japan. Then I have (Linda) 
always by my side when we’re on live and most important of all, she is my mothers partner in 
life now. Mom finally had to forget (Nadeshiko); Sakura’s mother that passed away just after 
Sakura was three years old. Mom almost died too, Nadeshiko was the only one for her forever 
but things happen. She pulled herself back together and buried herself into out business and 
has built it into the largest sound Electronics manufacturer in Japan now.      </p>

<p>	Well the announcer just asks if everyone was ready for the last performance, one of 
their life times. He got a somewhat usual response with a lot of people not knowing just 
what this was or who this Tomoyo Daidouji is so he tells everyone just who and what I really 
am. He looks out and around to all and begins. Well this young lady is 20 years old, a dress 
fashion designer and maker and just finished what she’ll be wearing, her very newest design 
when she comes out on the stage here. She also sings a little and she even plays the Piano a 
little but most importantly though, Tomoyo is also the Billionarest of the Daidouji 
Electronics Empire here in Japan. But guys don’t get any hopes up for this young lady as she 
is even busier than her mother and has no time for anyone, period. Well except for the one 
and only person in her life now or has ever been. So don’t be alarmed when she comes out 
with all her body guards and they are for real people, I’ve watched them work out because I 
am really Tomoyo’s Program Director and Announcer for all her events she performs at which 
are always Classical music but she worked up something a little different for you the 
audience here and people at this sports event. You will enjoy her performance believe me. He 
pointed to the certain and that was our Que. </p>

<p>	The audience almost laughed when Tomoyo’s guards rolled this dacored almost floor 
level piano platform out from behind the certains with this beautiful young lady and her 
smaller than the normal piano to the center of the stage for plenty of side viewing room. 
Tomoyo stood from her bench and adjusted her ear and cheek mounted mic and spoke into it, 
“can everyone hear me Ok?” The audience all waved so they must hear she thought. Tomoyo 
looked at and then pointed at her announcer, said, “Thanks for the intro Ron.” Tomoyo looked 
around at everyone, said, “Ron has been my announcer for about 10 years now. He said I made 
my dress here, well yes, I threw it together in a couple of hours last night.”</p>

<p>	 The dress was almost floor length and concert formal in design with neck and back 
lines that were quiet a little lower for her normally but she was only here to impress her 
one and only and for others to just look at and admire, they did too.  The dress texture was 
a very shiny sheen like backed very light silk and the color a Safire blue diamond sparkle 
like the sky at dusk and with short heels to match. </p>

<p>	Tomoyo continued, “He said I sang a little, well I do try. He also said that I play 
a little piano, well I do, my baby grand here that is, I’ve been at it for a few years now 
and I can make it sound like a lot of different instruments but there is one or so that just 
don’t sound quite right so I am using one of our latest synthizers for that and a few other 
little sounds that I can’t duplicate quite the same as the drums and like sounds. I know you 
ask, with me Classical and I want like rock drums? Well you‘ll see.”  </p>

<p>	Tomoyo looked around then behind her a little ways to where Sakura and the rest of 
the sports event winners were setting still on the stage and smilled right at Sakura, said, 
“Well tonight and the rest of my life I have to make a change in order to get what I really 
want in this, my life. The music piece I’m doing is more up beat and kind of tells a story 
of half of my life so far and I just want that special someone in my life to understand 
finally. This music is from a group in the US and I have already talked with them about 
doing it here today and they even give me rights to all proceeds from this as it will be 
recorded with a few more for a CD and used for something I will explain to you a little 
later or after I finish anyway, I certainly don’t need the money myself.”</p>

<p>	Now the whole place laughed at that last statement. Tomoyo looked out to everyone 
and said, “I’m usually quite Quiet and to myself but like I said I have to change tonight 
and this song is where it all starts.”  The lights went low and a single spot on her as she 
set, got positioned, smiled out at everyone, said, “I’m warming up with Beethoven’s most 
famous symphony mid keyboard downward run so don’t get too discouraged yet.” About 2 minutes 
of this warm up run and everyone trying to get their jaws back from the floor, she stopped 
and said, “But I think I’ll really start with my own warmup fingers exercise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Tomoyo looked back at Sakura and smiled again and started. Her right hand fingers 
were at the right or top note end of the key board with her left hand fingers were at the 
bottom or left end of her piano key board. Her warmup with both hand fingers doing a 
simultaneous “E” cord run from both ends to well past center the other direction twice and 
with everyone out there wondering if Beethover or even Back would have even tried knowing 
the embarrassment of failing such a simple looking run when in fact was probably the hardest 
either of them would have even tried to start with.</p>

<p>	 The audience was still quiet with mouths still hanging wide open just starring up 
at Tomoyo.  She then smiled out and hit her foot peddle to turn on the synthizer for the 
drum intro with her own little finger board play that simulated almost every drum beat to a 
tee and sounded as good as well. After the three phase drum runs she started her song and by 
now the audience was really into it as they finally recognized the music as one of the most 
popular in all of Japan and many other places on earth also.</p>

<p>	The whole place had people out dancing in the isles and on the main gym floor 
everywhere with a lot of the crowd out holding each other after really listening to just 
what the song said and suggested or meant. Girls holding girls, guys holding guys and of 
course girls holding guys too, the excepted way here in Japan but that long time ruling was 
about to be overlooked here at least and everyone was enjoying it and each other for a 
change. Like Love is love and not always gender bound. Tomoyo played on to the end of the 
music that everyone was dancing to right to the end now, knowing that if she wanted and let 
it, it would be a many million seller and a new sparkling voice that had just made its mark 
in all of Japan for sure with just this one piece. </p>

<p>	Tomoyo stood and bowed out to everyone in thanks for their hands and the cheers that 
could have easily brought the whole house down. Then she looked back to Sakura who had 
finally understood what it was that her best friend Tomoyo tried to tell her all ten years 
back it seemed now. Sakura was half way to Tomoyo when Tomoyo started towards her with a 
smile and arms wide open for her new partner in life and love she hoped anyway. Tomoyo and 
Sakura stopped an arms length apart and tears in both girls eyes, </p>

<p>	Sakura said, “why didn’t you just come on out and tell me back then Tomoyo?” </p>

<p>	Tomoyo inched a little closer, said, “I didn’t want to lose you if you didn’t 
understand my true feelings then Sakura, I love you, I always have.” </p>

<p>	Sakura now moved in a lot closer, said, “I loved you then too Tomoyo, you were 
always there for me when no one else was, you were my guardian angel always helping me with 
my cards when you had no power. Why did you think I wouldn’t have understood? Well you would 
have had to explain a few things back then for sure.” </p>

<p>	Tomoyo took Sakura’s hand and brought it close to her lips but stopped short to say, 
“Sakura, Do you remember what you said when Lee had his hands all over you and you hatted it 
and him for it?” Well that just hit me then that when you said you didn’t want anyones hand 
on you and I have always felt that if I would have told you my feeling then and you 
understood a little, I’d have to touch you to show my feeling and I was so afraid to touch 
you after that. Only here lately have I been able to hold you close to comfort you in my 
arms. I was afraid that you’ed hate me like you did Lee so I tried to stay my distence as 
bad as I hatted too. Sakura I want to be by your side the rest of my life no matter where we 
are because I love you so much my lady.”          </p>

<p>	Sakura finally pulled Tomoyo into her arms with a gentle but assertive embrace that 
surprised Tomoyo but that surprise was not even over yet when the next one hit her. Sakura 
put her arm around Tomoyo’s waist and lay her back a little, looked into her eyes smiling 
and said, “Tomoyo I didn’t mean for you not to touch me, you’re the one person I wanted to 
touch me and I didn’t know just how to tell you without you thinking I’m just a pervert so 
we both set there all this time wanting and neither making the first move, what an absolute 
waste of time. There must be thousands of girl couples out there just like us that are 
afraid to lose their love to say anything so just like us, no one says anything and their 
true love for each other dies after a while.”  </p>

<p>	“But Tomoyo, I’m not losing you ever if you still want me that long, I want you 
young lady and I‘m so sorry that I haven‘t shown you more often but I will from this night 
on my love.”</p>

<p>	Sakura let Tomoyo stand back up in her arms only to place a gentler kiss to Tomoyo’s 
lips than thought possibly from this very strong athlete. When Sakura finally pulled away 
from those sweet moist lips she went to one knee on the floor, took Tomoyo’s left hand and 
with all the confidencs in the world now asks, “Tomoyo my angel, will you marry me?” With 
Tomoyo’s mic still on and working just fine, everyone heard the question ask and broke out 
with cheers and yes’s to bring the house down again. </p>

<p>	Tomoyo smiled down into Sakura’s eyes and with tears in hers she answered “Yes 
Sakura, I’ve been dreaming of that question from you half of my life so yes if you still 
want me the rest of your life, yes. I will gladly be your wife the rest of our lives love 
and I will enjoy loving you a million ways too but I don‘t think we‘ll get to that many 
tonight though.” Everyone out there laughed and gives them the thumbs up sign to these two 
girls that had just given themselves to each other for a lifetime now. </p>
<p>	</p>

<p>	Tomoyo ask Lynda to take care of things here for tonight and that she and Sakura 
were going home after accepting thanks and good luck from all out on the floor and she would 
call them if she needed anything other than Sakura. Lynda sure smiled and said “thanks for 
finally telling Sakura your feeling no matter how you did it, the song was beautiful too. I 
think I’m going home to your mother too and keep her company as well, the rest of the night 
and many more because we finally decided to get married like you two here tonight.” They all 
hugged and headed to their destinations for now, Sakura and Tomoyo to the floor to accept 
thanks and good luck from everyone now.</p>

<p>	They finally got finished there and started walking home hand in hand but it was a 
different feeling for them tonight, a refound love after ten years together and a new life 
to start as soon as they got home which was going to be quick with them both running right 
now and laughing at each other as well.</p>

<p>	They run in at home and right to the shower to get ready for an evening of loven for 
real this time. As they finished their shower and let the other dry each other and with 
hands and fingers on the other in a hug and kiss that didn’t stop until they fell to the 
bed. Only to start all over again all over the others body now. As the night ticked on, so 
did they and try a little different manuver with the other and repetted many times until 
morning came way too early for both as they hadn’t even got a good start yet. Sakura laughed 
at Tomoyo when she asks how do we do that now I wonder. Tomoyo smiled at Sakura to say, 
“Well if we’d have done this years ago, we’d know how to do it now, wouldn’t we?” Sakura 
pulled Tomoyo back to her arms and said, “I love you Tomoyo love, my cute little piano 
player. Tomoyo kissed Sakuras lips, said, I love you too my beautiful young gymnast and with 
us not knowing too much about this love making thing much at all, that just means we got a 
lot of time to figure it all out right? Our whole life time together anyway.”</p>
