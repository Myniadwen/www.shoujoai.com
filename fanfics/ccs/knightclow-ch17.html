<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 17 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>&quot;You&#39;re actually nervous,&quot; Kaho Mitsuki sounded
faintly surprised as the long brown haired woman
reached out to place a hand on her lover&#39;s shoulder
comfortingly.

Sonomi Daidouji ran a hand through her shorter and
dark hair and sighed. &quot;Tomoyo and I always fight,&quot; she
reminded her, &quot;it&#39;s almost a law of nature.&quot;

&quot;Maybe this year will be different,&quot; Kaho said to her
gently, &quot;she did say she was bringing a friend along.&quot;

&quot;Maybe a professional referee?&quot; Sonomi joked.

All around them people were finishing the final
preparations for the party at the mansion, laying out
the food and setting up drinks just before the first
arrivals were due to arrive. Then silently the
caterers and maids faded to the background, waiting to
be called on to serve as needed.

Sonomi was firmly in her hostess mode as she greeted
close friends and various business associates, her
smile coolly welcoming and manner kept entirely
professional. Kaho still couldn&#39;t get over seeing the
many sides of her lover, how she could be the perfect
business woman yet also such a passionate lover, too.

Kaho blinked in surprise as she saw a familiar figure
smoothly glide into the entrance way, her black hair
up in a fine style. &quot;On behalf of my grandmother I
thank you for inviting me,&quot; Mei-lin said as she bowed
formally to Sonomi, &quot;and I&#39;m certain that she looks
forward to working more closely with your company.&quot;

&quot;The honor is mine,&quot; Sonomi answered with her own
graceful bow, &quot;and I hope you have a good time
tonight.&quot;

&quot;I occasionally forget how well connected Mei-lin&#39;s
family is,&quot; Kaho murmured as she moved up to stand
beside Sonomi, exchanging a smile and nod with the
younger woman who moved off to circulate through the
crowd.

Sonomi squeezed her hand gently, smiling back as they
waited till Mei-lin had moved on. &quot;They have contacts
all over Hong Kong and China,&quot; she agreed, &quot;inviting
Mei-lin seemed a small enough thing to earn some good
favor.&quot;

&quot;How you holding up?&quot; Kaho asked, seeing a flicker of
nerves in her eyes.

&quot;Just wondering when she&#39;s going to get here,&quot; Sonomi
quietly admitted, &quot;or even if she&#39;s really coming.
Tomoyo isn&#39;t the type to be fashionably late.&quot;

Kaho paused as they saw a flicker of movement near the
entrance then said, &quot;I think your question just got
answered.&quot;

There are some people who need to wear finery, to
purchase glitter and bangles to highlight whatever
natural beauty they had, but obviously Tomoyo wasn&#39;t
one of them. Instead she had gone for subtle elegance,
wearing a simple black dress, a touch of makeup and
little silver earrings. Beside her a lovely reddish
brown haired woman walked beside her, holding on to
Tomoyo&#39;s arm as if it was the most natural thing in
the world.

&quot;Dr. Kinomoto?&quot; Kaho blinked.

Sonomi smiled slightly as she whispered, &quot;Remind me to
talk to my investigators... they clearly missed the
relationship between them.&quot;

&quot;Good evening mother,&quot; Tomoyo said quietly as she
neared them, &quot;happy birthday.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sonomi said as she took a small package
from Tomoyo. She smiled at Tomoyo&#39;s companion, &quot;May I
ask...?&quot;

&quot;Like you don&#39;t know,&quot; Tomoyo murmured back with a wry
smile. Louder she said, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Doctor
Sakura Kinomoto.&quot;

&quot;Just Sakura, please,&quot; she smiled as she tossed Tomoyo
a amused look, &quot;I think she gets far too much pleasure
tossing my doctorate around.&quot;

Tomoyo smiled slightly, &quot;You should be proud of it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, Sakura,&quot; Sonomi purred. She
studied her a moment, &quot;I think I may have known your
mother, Nadesico...?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sakura nodded with a faint bit of regret in her
expression as she asked, &quot;Tomoyo tells me you were
cousins?&quot;

&quot;We were very close,&quot; Sonomi agreed.

Tomoyo frowned slightly, giving her mother a warning
look. &quot;Why don&#39;t we get some refreshments,&quot; she said,
&quot;I&#39;m sure Sonomi has other guests she needs to see
to.&quot;

&quot;I look forward to seeing you later,.&quot; Sakura smiled
as Tomoyo led her off.

&quot;You have the oddest look on your face,&quot; Kaho said as
she gently pulled Sonomi to a private corner of the
grand reception hall.

&quot;I feel like I saw a ghost,&quot; Sonomi confessed softly.
She smiled wryly, &quot;Sakura is the very image of a
younger Nadesico...&quot;

&quot;And you were in love with her,&quot; Kaho guessed.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sonomi admitted, flagging down a waiter and
retrieving a glass of fine wine. Taking a sip she
said, &quot;I never told her, of course.&quot;

&quot;First love,&quot; Kaho sighed. She looked at Sonomi
thoughtfully and asked, &quot;So you&#39;ve never met Sakura
before?&quot;

&quot;I was an ass about her marriage to Kinomoto,&quot; Sonomi
admitted with a sigh, &quot;that&#39;s why we were out of touch
for a while... then she died, and we never had a
chance to make up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Kaho said, squeezing her hand gently.

Over by the buffet Sakura and Tomoyo were loading up
their plates while talking together softly. &quot;I don&#39;t
think I was quite expecting a mansion,&quot; Sakura
admitted, smiling faintly as she looked at Tomoyo a
bit worriedly.

&quot;Maybe I should have warned you,&quot; Tomoyo conceded the
point, sipping her drink. Softly she said, &quot;It&#39;s got
fifty rooms including an indoor sauna, a ball room and
a dining hall that can serve over one hundred people.&quot;

&quot;And you grew up here?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Tomoyo shrugged, &quot;in between boarding
schools.&quot; She looked off into the distance, &quot;I think I
have fonder memories of the bodyguards and maids,
honestly.&quot;

Softly Sakura said, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

Tomoyo looked at her in surprise, then reached up to
wipe at her eyes. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;coming here
always makes me feel odd...&quot;

Sakura took her hands, squeezing them gently. &quot;From
what you&#39;ve told me I can understand,&quot; she said
softly.

Tomoyo met those caring eyes and was surprised to feel
her heart skip a beat in a most pleasant way. She
opened her mouth to say something...

...when a familiar voice said, &quot;Fancy seeing you
here.&quot;

&quot;Mei-lin,&quot; Sakura exclaimed as the elegant looking
Asian woman walked up to them, her eyes sweeping over
the two of them.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to interrupt,&quot; Mei-lin said apologetically,
her lips twisted in a half smile.

&quot;That&#39;s quite all right,&quot; Tomoyo answered, sighing.
She had no idea what might have happened between her
and Sakura before they were interrupted, but it was
clearly too late to do anything about it now. &quot;I
wasn&#39;t expecting to see you here,&quot; she added.

Mei-lin smiled calmly, &quot;My grandmother is a business
associate of Ms. Daidouji, so naturally I was
invited.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Tomoyo nodded.

&quot;It&#39;s good to have another friend here, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
Sakura offered cheerfully.

Tomoyo smiled wryly, &quot;I suppose so.&quot;

Mei-lin&#39;s eyes twinkled with amusement as she asked,
&quot;So what do you think of Sonomi dating the boss?&quot;

&quot;Hoee?&quot; Sakura looked startled.

Tomoyo smiled at her gently, &quot;There&#39;s been a rumor
around the paper that Kaho and Sonomi are seeing each
other.&quot; She nodded towards where the two older woman
stood close together, &quot;Looks like it may be true.&quot;</pre>
