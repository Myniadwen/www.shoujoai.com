<h1>Blooming Rosebuds</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/glyde.html">Glyde Dranzer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sakura was deep in mathematical calculations. She&#39;s been doing her 
assignments since lunch and throughout the afternoon. She groaned in 
frustration, unable to concentrate on solving the problem.

&quot;Still hard at work I see. Good. Keep at it.&quot; Kero-chan said, busy 
playing video games. Sakura made a face at Kero-chan&#39;s comment.

&quot;This isn&#39;t work. This is torture. God, why did they have to make math 
so hard?&quot; Sakura swore.

Kero-chan sucked his cheeks in, his eyes still focused on the T.V.

&quot;If you&#39;ve studied hard, it would be so complicated as you think.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to slave away on a study desk to solve impossible 
calculations.&quot; Sakura snapped.

&quot;You&#39;re right, I don&#39;t have to, since I don&#39;t need to study,&quot; 
Kero-chan replied, &quot;but you have to. It&#39;s part of your education. So 
don&#39;t fret, it&#39;s for your own good. Sakura shook her fist as a vein 
snaked on her forehead.

&quot;Stop lecturing me! You don&#39;t know how hard this is.&quot; Came Sakura&#39;s 
irritated voice. 

&quot;Don&#39;t take out your anger at me, Sakura. It&#39;s your fault you didn&#39;t 
study well in the first place.&quot;

They were both silent for a minute. Sakura sighed, breaking the 
silence.

&quot;Look at us, fighting over something not worth fighting over.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Kero-chan simply said. 

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Kero-chan. You&#39;re right. It&#39;s my fault. It&#39;s just that 
it&#39;s so hard.&quot; Sakura said apologetically. Kero-chan turned off the 
game console. He flew toward Sakura, perching on her shoulder.

&quot;I don&#39;t blame you for yelling. You&#39;re stressed out and besides; math 
isn&#39;t one of your favorite subjects. You should do something else to 
relax your head.&quot;

&quot;You know, I might as well do that.&quot; Sakura replied cheerfully as she 
set her math book aside. She took another book and started flipping 
through the pages. 

&quot;May as well start with that book report.&quot; She said as she flipped to 
the title page. Kero-chan&#39;s eyes widened as he read the book&#39;s title.

&quot;Slaves of the stomach.&quot; He said in a bewildered tone. He faced 
Sakura, looking at her ominously.

&quot;Where did you get this book?&quot;

Sakura smiled in mild embarrassment.

&quot;Brother gave this to me.&quot;

A single drop of sweat formed on Kero-chan&#39;s head as he flew toward 
the open dresser drawer, which was also his bed.

&quot;It suits you well.&quot;

Sakura only chuckled uneasily.

&quot;Going to sleep already?&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh. I&#39;m beat.&quot;

&quot;But you spent the whole day doing nothing.&quot; Came Sakura&#39;s surprised 
voice.

&quot;Doing nothing can be very tiring.&quot; Kero-chan said as he pulled the 
covers over himself.

&quot;Lazy bum,&quot; Sakura smirked, &quot;this book suits you better.&quot; Sakura 
finished a few pages and was turning to the next when her cell phone 
rang. She grabbed the phone.

&quot;Hello. Who is this?&quot;

&quot;Um... Sakura-chan...?&quot;

It was Tomoyo.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan, you called. What&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;Um... It&#39;s... Am I bothering you?&quot; Tomoyo asked reluctantly.

&quot;Well, I was reading a book,&quot; Sakura eyed the book, &quot;but it can wait. 
So anyway, why did you call?&quot;

&quot;I... was wondering if...you&#39;d like to... have dinner with me?&quot; Tomoyo 
hesitated

&quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; Sakura replied.

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes but first I got to ask dad for permission.&quot; and with that said 
Sakura raced downstairs. Tomoyo couldn&#39;t contain her joy as she 
plopped on her bed. She felt a surge of triumph but at the same time 
hoped and prayed that Sakura be allowed to go.

&quot;Dad said I could go.&quot; came Sakura&#39;s voice.

&quot;That&#39;s great!&quot; Tomoyo exclaimed, &quot;The car will pick you up an hour 
later.&quot;

&quot;All right. See you.&quot;

Sakura hung up, excitement visible on her face.

&quot;Going to Tomoyo&#39;s?&quot; Kero-chan asked sleepily from beneath the covers. 

Sakura grunted happily in response.

&quot;Be sure to take home some cake for me.&quot; He said, not even bothering 
to look up.

&quot;I will.&quot; She replied as she went to the bathroom. As she turned on 
the tap for the hot water, she slowly disrobed, thinking of reasons 
why Tomoyo invited her over. Is she lonely and in need of her company? 
Is she going to ambush her with tape measure? Is she going to give her 
a new costume? The bathtub was already filled with water. She slowly 
got in the tub, disappearing in a cloud of steam.

Tomoyo sat in her room anxiously as she waited for Sakura to arrive. 
The scent of a thousand roses filled the air. Every minute seemed like 
an hour to her. She checked everything to the last minor detail to 
make sure nothing was left out and everything was perfect. Tomoyo got 
up and went to her full-length mirror to check on her looks. She 
brushed her hair some more and applied lip-gloss. Content with her 
looks she proceeded to sit on her seat and wait. The maid came in with 
the dinner, hot and fresh from the kitchen, then left. At the same 
time she heard the car honk.

&quot;Right on schedule.&quot; She mumbled to herself as she hastily activated 
her video camera, lit the candles and turned off the lights. All of 
that done she returned to her seat, counting every second that passes. 
Then came a knock on the door.

&quot;Come in.&quot; Tomoyo said nervously, watching intently as the door slowly 
opened. Her eyes widened at the spectacle before her. Sakura came in 
wearing a yellow party dress with a white ribbon up front. She looked 
more beautiful in the dim light than ever. Sakura&#39;s eyes widened as 
well as she looked around Tomoyo&#39;s bedroom. Many bouquets filled the 
room, the bed almost out of sight due to the dark, a table and two 
chairs. Then her gaze fell on Tomoyo. Tomoyo wore a red party dress 
that blended perfectly with the dark surroundings.

&quot;Wow! What happened to your room?&quot; Sakura asked in amazement.

&quot;I redecorated it for this special night,&quot; Tomoyo replied sweetly. 
Tomoyo approached Sakura.

&quot;Have a seat.&quot; She said as she offered a seat to Sakura. Sakura 
complied as she slowly took her seat. She looked around again, gasping 
in awe. She then stared at Tomoyo whose eyes glimmered with the 
candlelight. They started dinner. Tomoyo watched as Sakura nibbled her 
dinner, watching her lips enclose around the juicy piece of meat. 
Tomoyo pursed her lips, licking it intently. Sakura noticed the look 
and blushed profusely.

&quot;Um... Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Could you please not look at me like that? You&#39;re making me fell 
horribly ill-mannered.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot; Tomoyo regained herself as she took a bite. But she kept 
on staring at Sakura watching her chew and swallow. They were silent 
for a minute, both waiting for the other to start a conversation.

&quot;I&#39;ve never had honey-cured beef before.&quot; Tomoyo decided to say 
something awkward to put Sakura at ease.

&quot;Me either.&quot; Sakura replied, loosening up in spite of the richness 
spread before her.

&quot;So... why invite me to dinner?&quot; Sakura asked. Tomoyo thought for a 
while, checking herself what to say.

&quot;I...I needed an excuse to be with you.&quot;

&quot;An &#39;excuse&#39;?&quot;

Tomoyo regretted saying that word and decided to make up for it.

Sakura said nothing but rose from her seat. She slowly walked near the 
bed, where many bouquets lay. She smelled the roses and smiled. Tomoyo 
rose as well and approached Sakura, stopping behind her, awaiting her 
next words.

&quot;Is that all? You wanted to be with me?&quot;

Tomoyo&#39;s mouth felt dry. She didn&#39;t know what to do or what to say. 
She just bowed her head and closed her eyes.

&quot;I knew it. I spoiled everything by trying hard to make everything 
perfect.&quot;

&quot;No you didn&#39;t&quot; 

Tomoyo&#39;s eyes shot open as she heard those words.

&quot;It&#39;s sweet of you, going through all that trouble just to please me.&quot;

Tomoyo couldn&#39;t control herself any longer but ran to embrace Sakura, 
Sakura receiving her with open arms. Tomoyo could fell the warmth of 
her friend. She gathered the strength the courage she needed to say 
what she wanted to say a long time ago.

&quot;I... there is something I have to tell you.&quot;

&quot;Hmmmm?&quot;

Tomoyo released Sakura and stepped back. Her lips trembled as she 
clasped her hands together, summoning every bit of courage she had.

&quot;I... I love you, Sakura-chan. I always have.&quot;

Tomoyo felt a heavy burden being lifted from her shoulders. But that 
relief was short-lived as she looked up to see Sakura eyes wide and 
her mouth small. It was the greatest shock in her life. Her body 
shivered and she got teary-eyed.

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry if I offended you. I...&quot; Tomoyo turned to run away but 
Sakura reached out grabbing hold of her hand. Tomoyo felt Sakura&#39;s 
soft hands holding her own silky smooth hands. She stopped, a tear 
sliding down her cheek, faced Sakura and braced herself.

&quot;I love you too.&quot;

Before Tomoyo could react, Sakura made the first move, kissing Tomoyo 
softly on the lips. Tomoyo&#39;s head spun wildly upon feeling Sakura&#39;s 
rosy lips on hers. She finally heard the words she wanted to hear and 
painstakingly waited for. She moaned feeling Sakura insert her tongue 
into Tomoyo&#39;s mouth. She did the same, pushing her tongue in Sakura&#39;s 
mouth. Tomoyo groped at Sakura&#39;s back, undoing her zipper. Sakura knew 
what Tomoyo wanted to do so she broke the kiss, focusing on undressing 
one another. As their clothes started to fall to the floor one by one, 
Tomoyo was the happiest girl in the world. Making love to Sakura was 
not in the plan but now it was her top priority, to make Sakura happy. 
With their garments off Sakura resumed the kiss, feeling their bodies 
rub against each other. Their young erect nipples were in direct 
contact as they rubbed against each other. Tomoyo this time broke the 
kiss, pushed Sakura softly on the bed and got on top of her. Sakura 
flopped on the soft bed, eyes slanted seductively and her mouth 
slightly open waiting for Tomoyo to make the next move. Tomoyo smiled 
lustfully ass she moved closer, taking Sakura&#39;s erect nipple in her 
mouth. Sakura gasped as Tomoyo suckled on her young breast stopping 
from time to time to play with it with her wet tongue. Tomoyo&#39;s hand 
traveled down to Sakura&#39;s pussy and started to rub her lips. Sakura 
moaned as she felt her pussy get hot and wet from Tomoyo&#39;s rubbing. 
Tomoyo stopped her suckling and focused on masturbating Sakura. She 
rubbed harder then pushed her finger in gently.

&quot;Uuuuhhhh!&quot;

Sakura arched her back as she felt Tomoyo&#39;s finger slip inside her wet 
throbbing pussy. She moaned louder and started to move her hips along, 
slowly grinding herself on Tomoyo&#39;s finger. Tomoyo smiled at the girl 
whimpering at her every touch. She could feel Sakura&#39;s vagina muscles 
contracting on her finger, as it got increasingly hot and wet. She 
liked the feeling as she continued to push her finger in and out, 
faster and harder. Sakura&#39;s moaning heightened as intense feelings 
washed over her. Almost instinctively she massed her young tits. She 
rocked her hips harder to increase the pleasure. Tomoyo knew that 
Sakura was going to explode her juices, and that&#39;s what she wanted.

&quot;That&#39;s it Sakura-chan. Moan and scream my name.&quot; Tomoyo encouraged as 
she rammed her finger hard into Sakura.

&quot;Stop!!!&quot;

Tomoyo ceased her fingering and looked up to Sakura, puzzled.

&quot;Why Sakura-chan? You almost came.&quot;

Sakura shook her head violently.

&quot;Just take it out! Please!&quot;

Tomoyo complied and slowly pulled her juice-coated finger out of 
Sakura&#39;s wet hole. Sakura moaned as she felt Tomoyo&#39;s finger leave 
her. Both girls were a little disappointed but Sakura wanted to savor 
the moment. Sakura rolled Tomoyo on her back. She smiled wickedly as 
she took Tomoyo&#39;s wet ahnd and gingerly placed it on Tomoyo&#39;s sex and 
started to rub it. Tomoyo moaned. She liked the sloshy feeling of 
Sakura&#39;s juices on her bare lips. Sakura stopped rubbing and brought 
her face to Tomoyo&#39;s pussy, forcing her face to it, licking 
innocently, not knowing which parts to stimulate. Tomoyo gasped and 
whimpered as Sakura continued to lick her girlhood. Tomoyo opened her 
legs wider so Sakura could lick and experience more of her. Sakura 
noticed a nub and looked at it curiously. She decided to give it a 
lick.

&quot;Aaaahhhh!&quot;

Tomoyo cried out as Sakura focused on that spot. Each stroke of 
Sakura&#39;s tongue on clit caused her to shriek even more. Her wetness 
increased and her body got hotter. Sakura took the advantage and 
started to lap at Tomoyo&#39;s juices. Just then Tomoyo, knowing that she 
was about to orgasm, pushed Sakura&#39;s head away. Both girls were 
panting heavily.

&quot;I... I want to taste you too.&quot;

Sakura smiled, shifting to a 69 position. Their soaked pussies faced 
the others face. Tomoyo inhaled deeply, enjoying the musky sweet smell 
of Sakura&#39;s sex. She licked her lips intently before proceeding to 
stimulate her partner. Sakura cried out as she felt Tomoyo&#39;s tongue 
swirl around her clit. It seems Tomoyo also knows a girl&#39;s pleasure 
spots. Sakura retaliated by shoving her tongue into Tomoyo&#39;s juicy 
pussy. They moaned as they licked each other, the taste of their love 
juices exiting them even more. Their cries and moans grew louder and 
more frequent as their moment drew near. They slowly moved their hips, 
moving along with each other&#39;s tongue. Tomoyo, tears falling o her 
cheeks, moaned loudly as she licked Sakura. She was visibly happy, as 
well as Sakura, who continued to swirl her tongue in Tomoyo&#39;s sex. 
They didn&#39;t care if anyone heard them. The love they share for each 
other, the feel of their bude bodies against each other, the pleasure 
that&#39;s driving them wild, that&#39;s all that mattered. Suddenly they 
shrieked loudly as they came together. Their love juices spurting and 
flowing out of their pussies on each other&#39;s face, lips and in to 
their mouths. Sakura moved up thighs, legs and face sticky with juices 
as she kissed Tomoyo, tasting their love juices in their mouths, 
enjoying their orgasm. Exhausted but satisfied, they nestled in each 
other&#39;s arms, breathing deeply.

&quot;Sakura-chan, that was indescribable.&quot; Tomoyo whispered.

&quot;We should do this more often.&quot; Sakura suggested.

&quot;Yeah, everyday if possible.&quot;

They gave each other a slow sensuous kiss. Tomoyo licked her lips and 
smiled.

&quot;I guess that was dessert.&quot; she cracked.

Tomoyo&#39;s comments on having hot sticky girl cum for dessert made them 
laugh hard. Sakura wiped off the tears in Sakura&#39;s eyes and smiled.

&quot;I love you, Tomoyo-chan.&quot; Sakura said sleepily.

&quot;I love you too, Sakura-chan.&quot; Tomoyo replied.

They held each other as they drifted to a deep sleep.

Outside the room, Sonomi smiled and took out her cellphone.

&quot;Hello, Fujitaka.&quot;

&quot;Sonomi, you called,&quot; a voice came, &quot;is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Everything is okay,&quot; she replied, &quot;Sakura is going to spend the night 
here. Is that fine with you?&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t bring any pajamas. I&#39;ll drop by and-&quot;

&quot;No need, Fujitaka.&quot; Sonomi smiled slyly.

&quot;Well, okay if you say so. By the way, is Sakura having a great time?&quot;

&quot;Having a great time?&quot; Sonomi repeated, &quot;Of course she is.&quot;

She hung up and chuckled mischievously to herself.

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised, Fujitaka.&quot;</pre>
