*******************************************************************

Dear Diary,

It was love at first site&#133;for me at least&#133;her angelic smile, her tender 
voice, An angel.

The  sweet scented name.

&#147;Sakura.&#148;

How I love her&#133;

Yet  I must face facts, she dose not love me back.

So  timid and innocent.

I can not be mad, I must be happy for her.

For Sakura.

I can still remember the day we met&#133;

All thoose years ago.

&#147;Do you have an eraser?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;You can keep mines!&#148;

The good days, When I could be happy for her&#133;

Are gone.

We are 16 now.

And in our 10th year of school&#133;

She&#146;s become so wrapped in him.

I cannot smile any longer&#133;

She&#146;s changed so much.

I feel she&#146;s scared of me&#133;

I confronted her today&#133;

I told her how I felt.

Timid, Sakura-chan.

&#147;I love you too, Tomoyo-chan!&#148;

She dosen&#146;t understand&#133;

I couldn&#146;t help but cry a bit&#133;

I opened my hand&#133;

And clasped hers&#133;

I placed the tiny eraser&#133;

The ultimate symbol of my love&#133;

She blinked timidly at me&#133;

I smiled.

I kissed her check softly.

And on her check I cried.

She didn&#146;t understand&#133;

Just as I had expected.

&#147;T-Tomoyo-&#147;

I brought my finger to her small pink lips.

&#147;Sakura-chan, Koishiteru.&#148;

I let go of her as he had appeared.

She smiled at him.

My gaze never left her.

She walked away with him.

Randomly turning to see me&#133;

I ran home&#133;

And Am writing to you.

I am afraid I must end now&#133;

End forever.

Tomoyo.

****************************************************************

Dear Diary,

Tomoyo-chan is acting very strangely&#133;

Today after school she came up to me.

She told me she loved me again&#133;

What was I suppose to say, Diary?

This is not the first time she has said this&#133;

&#147;I love you too Tomoyo-chan.&#148;

She started to cry?

I really don&#146;t understand her&#133;

Dose she not understand my true feelings after all theese years?

I&#146;m in love with her.

I thought she&#146;d understand that by now&#133;

She makes me very sad&#133;

I talked to Li-kun about it.

He keeps telling me that I need to come right out and say it&#133;

But I do that!

She still doesn&#146;t understand&#133;

It&#146;s always been like this.

She&#146;d say something loving towards me&#133;

And I&#146;d blush or make a silly face.

Only because I was to shy to say that I loved her just as much.

And when I did, I must have not sounded like I meant it&#133;

Because she still did not realize my feelings!

I flirted with Yukitou-san&#133;

But only so Tomoyo wouldn&#146;t think I liked her&#133;

Is she still wrapped around that idea?

I love her with all my heart.

I have to tell her.

End,

Sakura.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

The dark haired girl made her way into her room, locking the door behind her.

She sat down at her desk, smiling at all the many costumes she had 
designed for Sakura.

When she could talk to Sakura without crying&#133;

She shed a small tear was shed from sad violet eyes.

She looked at the tiny wallet sized picture of her love&#133;

&#147;Sakura-chan&#133;&#148;

&#147;P-PP-lease forgive me&#133;&#148;

She reached into the pocket of her long beige dress and pulled out a 
tiny knife

She cried and begin to sing the words to her part of her friendship 
song to Sakura.

&#147;ORINJI no hana ga saiteru utsuriki na aozora mitai ni &#147;

She very slowly brought the knife into her wrist, screaming as a 
poweful wave of pain took over her.

She continued to sing.

 &#147;Toor--i ame nara ba kasa ha--- iranai ne niji no kaidan no boreba 
aoi---sora&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan!&#148;

She yelped as she begin to quickly saw through her wrist, turning paler 
than she had

Every been before, she collapsed onto the floor and fainted&#133;

Half-dead her heart skipping beats.

There was a loud knock on the door of her house.

&#147;TOMOYO-CHAN!&#148;

It was Sakura.

&#147;Tomoyo-chan, Tomoyo-chan!!&#148;

A mysterious force helped strengthen Sakura to break the lock and she 
rushed upstairs to Tomoyo&#146;s room.

She heard her voice singing very lowly.

She burst into the room to find her love lying half-dead on the floor&#133;

Sakura cried as she knelt down next to the dark haired girl.

She sang as she fondled Tomoyo&#146;s bloodied wrists.

&#147;kaze no naka kami o nabikase kakete yuku hane no arukutsu de&#148;

&#147;Saku-RAAA-chaaaan&#133;&#148;

&#147;kujike sou na toki ha watashi ga iru no yo subu ni tonde ikeru kara 
itsu datte&#39; &#147;

When it seems like you&#39;re going break, I&#39;ll be there for you Because 

I&#39;ll fly to you right away Always.

Tomoyo grew paler, Sakura pressed her small-framed body against her 
love.

&#147;An-ata-no-Ireba-&#147; Whispered the lips of the dark haired girl.

&#147;Koishiteru, Tomoyo-chan.&#148;

&#147;I love you with all my heart.&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan!&#148;

The dark haired girl&#146;s face brightened.

Sakura pressed her small strawberry lips against Tomoyo&#146;s own

And gave her a very passionate kiss.

She felt Tomoyo&#146;s pulse slow&#133;

&#147;Tomoyo-chan&#133;?&#148;

There came no reply.

&#147;To-mo-yo-cha-n&#133;?!&#148;

Still no answer.

&#147;TOMOYO-CHAAAAN!!&#148;

&#147;Ko-I-ss-hiteru, Sakura-chan.&#148;

Her pulse stopped.

&#147;IIE, TOMOYO-CHAAAN!!&#148;

****************************************************************

Dear Diary,

It has been 5 year since her death&#133;

I&#146;m 21 now&#133;and married to Li-kun.

I have kids now too.

A daughter and a son.

My daughter looks just like Tomoyo-chan did&#133;

At least her face.

I&#146;m going to let her hair grow out, to remind me of her.

I&#146;ve been to see her grave everday since I was 16.

I&#146;m also taking good care of all the costumes and videos she made of 
me.

She was so obsessed.

But I was too&#133;

Shiori (That&#146;s my daughter&#146;s name) ask me about theese tapes..I just 
smile and tell

Her about Tomoyo-chan.

She tried to try on the costumes, but they were much to big on her, she 
is small.

Li-kun sometimes worries that  I&#146;m taking in to much memories of her 
and will get sad.

But I&#146;m getting very happy.

In fact I&#146;m going to visit her grave now&#133;

And place her little bunny eraser right ontop of her flowers.

A bouqet of Cherry Blossoms.

Her favorite.

I must go now old friend.

Ja ne!!

Li Sakura.

****************************************************************

^-^ My first yuri fanfic&#133;eh&#133;maybe it was kinda simple but, who cares?!

Hmm&#133;I kinda wished I didn&#146;t make Tomoyo-chan die&#133;.;.; She&#146;s sooo cute!!

I love the idea of Sakura and Tomoyo being together&#133;hmmm&#133;perhaps I&#146;ll 
make another resulting that way&#133;But this week I&#146;m going to be basically 
focusing on Michiru/Haruka (So perfect together!) 

I&#146;m gonna get started on that right now,

Ja ne!!
