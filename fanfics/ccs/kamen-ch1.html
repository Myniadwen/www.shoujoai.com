<h1>Tomoyo Kamen...? (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>        &quot;All right,&quot; Sakura raised her star staff to a ready 
position, the girl dressed in a pink, ruffled costume looking up at 
the massive creature that was shuffling through the 
neighborhood, &quot;Li, can you distract this thing?&quot;

        Dressed in his traditional battle garb Li looked up at the 
creature and gulped a bit nervously before squeaking out, &quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;

        &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Sakura reassured him with a smile, &quot;we can 
handle this.&quot;

        &quot;Lets hope,&quot; Li sighed softly.

        The thing shambled forward, and Li raised his sword 
defensively. Sakura ran to the side, the Windy Card held in her 
hand, &quot;Now if he keeps it distracted...&quot;

        Thwack! A rose was flung down into the ground dramatically.

        Quite strangely, in the background Sakura could hear what 
sounded like a Spanish guitar playing. She looked around her wildly 
for the source of the music for a few moments, then looked up to see 
a figure who was standing up on a nearby wall. The black tuxedo 
hugged a slim female form, and the white mask concealed part of the 
face.

        Holding a rose in her hand the masked figure said in a very 
familiar but dramatic voice, &quot;Anyone who dares threaten my Sakura-
chan will answer to... Tuxedo Kamen!&quot;

        &quot;Tomoyo?&quot; Sakura blinked in surprise at her surprisingly 
cool looking friend, completely forgetting about Li just behind her.

        &quot;Ah, Sakura?&quot; Li slowly backed away from the creature, but 
it lunged at him and he gasped out, &quot;A little help here?&quot;

        Not noticing Li at all Sakura asked, &quot;What are you doing 
here, Tomoyo?&quot;

        Smiling with a remarkably charming style Tomoyo said, &quot;I 
would do anything to be of help to my Sakura-chan!&quot;

        Crouched behind the wall, hiding and playing Spanish guitars 
one of Tomoyo&#39;s many bodyguards asked the others, &quot;Why are we doing 
this again?&quot;

        &quot;Atmosphere,&quot; one of the others added a bit of a flamboyant 
strum before continuing, &quot;and because Tomoyo-sama needs us to do it!&quot;

        &quot;Good enough,&quot; the first bodyguard agreed, while yet another 
used a video camera to record Tomoyo and Sakura together.

        &quot;Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh god, just kill me now,&quot; Li whimpered like a 
little girl as the creature pounded him into the floor.

        &quot;You look really good in that costume,&quot; Sakura murmured as 
Tomoyo leapt down from the wall to stand right beside her.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Tomoyo reached out to gently caress Sakura&#39;s 
cheek and added with a cool smile, &quot;I wore it just for you.&quot;

        Large throbbing hearts appeared in Sakura&#39;s eyes as she 
threw her arms around her and gasped, &quot;Oh, Tomoyo-chan! I love you 
the best!&quot;

        &quot;I love you too, Sakura!&quot; Tomoyo hugged her back. As they 
hugged she noticed the increasingly faint noises Li was making in 
the background. &quot;But what about Li-kun?&quot;

        &quot;Oh, right,&quot; Sakura suddenly remembered him. &quot;Windy!&quot; she 
raised the Card and continued, &quot;Become the chain of punishment!&quot;

        In moments the Windy had bound the creature, leaving a very 
relieved Li laying there in a heap on the floor. &quot;Oh thank you,&quot; Li 
managed weakly.

        &quot;Do you want to go to my house?&quot; Tomoyo offered her tuxedo 
clad arm to Sakura quite gentlemanly, &quot;We could watch some of my 
more.. interesting videos.&quot;

        &quot;Really?&quot; Sakura smiled, &quot;What kind of videos?&quot;

        Tomoyo looked thoughtful, &quot;They&#39;ll be very... educational.&quot;

        The two of them moved off together, the guitar playing 
bodyguards soon falling in behind them. &quot;What about me?&quot; Li 
whimpered pitifully.

        &quot;LI-kun!&quot; he was suddenly glomped from behind, sending the 
young man crashing to the ground again. &quot;I&#39;ve missed you so much,&quot; 
she squealed.

        &quot;Mei-Lin?&quot; Li managed. With a soft groan the boy 
muttered, &quot;Is everyone in this stupid story out of character?&quot;

        &quot;Nah,&quot; Mei-Lin bounded to her feet to help pull him up as 
the girl explained cheerfully, &quot;I&#39;ve just been hanging out with 
Wakaba lately.&quot;

        Li groaned as Mei-Lin dragged him off bodily...

Author&#39;s Note: I&#39;m not planning on continuing this, I just wanted to 
do a silly little one-shot on Sakura and friends. I&#39;m not sure where 
the idea of having Tomoyo dress up at Tuxedo Kamen came from, but it 
was pretty fun to write.

        &quot;It&#39;s the suit,&quot; Tomoyo popped up to say with a 
grin, &quot;chicks dig the suit.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, Tomoyo-chan!&quot; Sakura threw her arms around her and 
dragged her to the ground. Happy noises and flying clothes are soon 
seen...

        ^_^; Anyway, I&#39;m hoping that you all enjoyed this. Positive 
reviews will be answered, and any negative reviews will be ignored. </pre>
