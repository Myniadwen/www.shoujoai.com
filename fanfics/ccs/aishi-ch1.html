<h1>Aishiteru</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kamui.html">Kamui Ikari</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hello everyone!!! Let me introduce myself. I am Kamui Ikari (my true
name is Claudio) I am from Argentina and I am a great fan of CCS and
other works of Clamp, and this is my first story of CCS. My english is
not very good so it can have grammatical errors. This story is focused
in Sakura and on what she thinks when she finds about the feelings of
Tomoyo. I hope you like it and I will see you at the end of the story.

companies. This history was only made by amusement, don&#39;t sue me.

*********

I didn&#39;t know. Really, I didn&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t know that Tomoyo
Daidouji, my best friend, was in love with me. She didn&#39;t tell it to
me. I found out while reminiscing on my past, remembering the points
that I couldn&#39;t understand. One was that Tomoyo had told me that she
loved me and that when we were older she would explain to me better.

Another point was when she requested me if she could cut my hair, I
told her that yes but I also asked her why. She said &quot;Because I like
you, Sakura&quot;. The only thing that I remember is that I blushed. While I
am recumbent looking toward the sky shattered in this cold night, I
remember the things that she had told me about her &quot;special person&quot;,
that she wanted her &quot;special person&quot; to be happy. I am so stupid, other
people understood it, why I am the only person that doesn&#39;t understand
anything? Why I had never found out about the other&#39;s feelings? Syaoran
admitted it to me before leaving toward Hong Kong, the feelings of my
brother toward Yukito and vice versa and the feelings of Tomoyo toward
me.

Tomoyo-chan... why am I your &quot;special person&quot;? Why me? Even knowing it,
why don&#39;t I get scared? Others had gotten scared but I am not afraid, I
am not. I get out of bed and I go towards my dresser, I open it and I
see the costumes that she made me for the capture of the cards. They
are so many and of varied designs. I always found strange that she
makes me those costumes and it record me in video. She always tried to
be present in the moment where I captured the cards to film me, I
didn&#39;t care but sometimes I feared that something might happen to her,
several times already, with the card &quot;The Erase&quot; and the fight with
Eriol. I believe that that was her way of showing her love for me. She
must think that her feelings never would be returned, that because my
stupidity I would never find about her feelings. I close the dresser
and I go to the bed, it is already late and I should go to the school,
tomorrow I will continue thinking of Tomoyo.

*************

I wake up when I hear a voice calling me. It was an unknown voice but I
make an effort and I wake up but I see that somebody&#39;s in my room.

&quot;Sakura-chan&quot;

I get out of bed and I see Tomoyo. She is in my room. She has a white
dress, and is smiling.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan, what are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I came to say goodbye to you, Sakura-chan&quot;

My heart stopped when I heard those words.

&quot;To say goodbye?&quot; I ask, shocked.

&quot;Yes, Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo calmly says.

&quot;But, where are you going?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know where I&#39;ll go, I only know that trip we all make it
arrived this moment.&quot;

&quot;All?&quot;

&quot;Yes, even you will make it.&quot;

&quot;I will see you again?&quot; I ask, while I feel tears begin to fall for my
cheeks.

&quot;No&quot; Tomoyo says with sadness.

When I hear this I get up and I run to hug her, crying. Having her in
my arms I feel something that I had never felt before. A warmth hugs my
heart in a special way and it beats quickly. I hug her strongly and I
don&#39;t want to let her go.

&quot;Don&#39;t go, please&quot; I say babbling.

&quot;Sakura-chan, can you promise me something?&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot;

&quot;Can you promise me that you will be happy?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t be happy without you&quot; I say with sadness.

&quot;I was happy to be by your side. You have given me a lot, and I will
never forget you.&quot;

&quot;Tomoyo-chan...&quot; I begin to cry.

Suddenly she looks at me smiling and puts a hand on my cheek.

&quot;You are cute, Sakura-chan...&quot;

I blush when I feel her hand, suddenly she comes closer and her lips
touch mine for a moment. I freeze but my heart emanates a very intense
warmth and I see that she&#39;s leaving me.

&quot;Tomoyo!&quot; I scream crying.

She looks at me with a smile and suddenly her body starts to disappear,
beginning with her feet.

&quot;Aishiteru, Sakura-chan&quot; she says before disappearing completely.

&quot;TOMOYO!&quot;

*************

I wake up, startled and with tears in my eyes. It was just a dream,
only a dream but I don&#39;t trust the dreams. They are usually sometimes
premonitory, and I have already had several before, the only thing that
I had left fixed in the mind was the kiss that Tomoyo gave me was and
her final words: &quot;Aishiteru, Sakura&quot;. Then I remembered what Eriol told
me before leaving for England. Then I found that he told me had two
meanings, not only referred to that someone who goes far like in the
case of Syaoran but rather it also referred to that a person that goes
far away because that person... dies.

I couldn&#39;t accept that Tomoyo would die, it must be a dream, I look at
my clock and I see that I have still time to go to the school, but I
don&#39;t want to sleep, I prefer to solve the topic of Tomoyo. I took a
picture of Tomoyo of the many that I have and I observe it: she is
smiling while her hair moves by the wind. I like her smile, the eyes
that she has, her voice, my life is not the same one since I met her at
the first time, she was always to my side, she gave me support in the
difficult moments and if she leaves... I don&#39;t know what to do.

I look inside of my interior the answer to my question. Who is my
special person? After a long effort I discover the answer, but I also
found that I am late for the school. I go to the dining room to have
breakfast. I greet my father and my brother and took my roller blades
and I go quickly so that I can make it to the school. I enter to the
classroom and I sit down. I feel that the time doesn&#39;t pass, and Tomoyo
doesn&#39;t appear. I become nervous, the dream returns with force. I tried
to forget it, when a voice makes me lift my head.

&quot;Hello, Sakura-chan.&quot;

I can&#39;t believe what I see, it was Tomoyo and she was smiling. My heart
begins to beat strongly.

&quot;Tomoyo...&quot;

I feel a tear fall for my cheek, but I dry it with my hand. But I don&#39;t
care about that. She&#39;s here, all is well, I only care about that.

&quot;Hello, Tomoyo-chan&quot; I say with a great relief and with a great smile.

I couldn&#39;t concentrate on the class, I looked indirectly at Tomoyo, the
only thing that I wanted was to be able to have one minute alone with
her to speak. In the recess I was not able to due to our friends. So, I
will have to wait until classes finish.

The class concludes, and all the kids retire, I looked that Tomoyo
preparing her things and I come closer to her.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan&quot; I ask.

&quot;Yes, Sakura-chan?&quot; Tomoyo responds with a smile.

&quot;Can we speak now in the park?&quot; I ask her.

&quot;Sure&quot; Tomoyo says.

When we&#39;re leaving the school I saw Tomoyo&#39;s bodyguards waiting for
her. I feel a little nervous. I know that they take care of her but I
don&#39;t want them here. Tomoyo comes closer to them and she tells them
something, later they leave and she comes closer to me.

&quot;Can we go?&quot; she asks me with a smile.

&quot;Yes&quot;

While we go walking toward the park, we speak about several things. I
feel fine knowing that she was fine. I take her hand and we continue
walking until we arrive at the park.

I sit down in one of the swings of the park and Tomoyo in another. I
feel nervous, I don&#39;t know how to start.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sakura-chan?&quot;

&quot;Well... I... I...&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s happened, Sakura-chan?&quot;

&quot;Will you go away to some distant place?&quot; I ask finally.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Tomoyo asks surprised.

&quot;Will you leave?&quot; I ask quietly.

&quot;No, Sakura-chan. I won&#39;t leave to any side.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; I ask hopeful.

&quot;Yes&quot; Tomoyo says smiling.

&quot;Do you mean that you will stay forever with me?&quot; I ask anxious.

&quot;Yes&quot; Tomoyo answers.

When I listening this I get up and hug her, with tears in my eyes.

&quot;Thank you, thank you&quot; I say happily.

Tomoyo looks at me smiling and when I see this I feel that I&#39;ll lose
the control, and I let my feelings dominate me, I look at her with
sweetness and I smile.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;What, Sakura-chan?&quot;

&quot;What I wanted to tell you is... I want to ask you for forgiveness, for
the many times I didn&#39;t understand what you really wanted to tell me&quot; I
say seriously.

&quot;About what?&quot; Tomoyo asks.

&quot;About your feelings.&quot;

Tomoyo becomes serious and she tried to get free of my hug, but I don&#39;t
leave her.

&quot;Please, I really want to ask you for forgiveness for not finding out
about it before&quot; I say with sincerity.

&quot;Sakura...&quot; Tomoyo says.

&quot;But... I...&quot;

Then I knew that it was the moment.

&quot;Aishiteru... Tomoyo-chan&quot; I say finally.

Tomoyo opens her eyes and froze.

&quot;It&#39;s true. You are the one I can love, you are my &quot;special person&quot;,
you are everything to me, not Syaoran . He&#39;s only a friend to me.
Please my beloved Tomoyo-chan, give me a chance to be happy with you...
and you with me&quot; I said with sincerity while I put my head on her
shoulder.

Tomoyo doesn&#39;t respond. She is still shocked, I wait for her reply,
while I run my hand through her hair, it&#39;s smooth and beautiful.
Suddenly Tomoyo returns my embrace strongly and she looked at me
smiling.

&quot;Aishiteru... Sakura-chan&quot; she says with a smile.

When I hear her words, the words that I wanted to hear, I come closer
and kiss her on the lips, my heart emits the same warmth that I felt in
the dream. I pulled away of her and Tomoyo kissed me again. After that
I hugged her tightly.

&quot;I&#39;m so happy, Tomoyo-chan&quot; I say happily.

&quot;My Sakura-chan, me too. You are my true love&quot; Tomoyo says with tears
in her eyes.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan, do you want to be my girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Yes!!!&quot; Tomoyo answers happily.

Then I take her hand and we go toward my house, I don&#39;t care anything
because she is with me, I am sure that we will be together forever.

That is what I most desire.
