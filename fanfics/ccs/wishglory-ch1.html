<h1>Wish for a Morning Glory</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/glyde.html">Glyde Dranzer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sakura&#39;s eyes fluttered as she awoke. To her surprise, she found herself 
in Tomoyo&#39;s room. She looked around bewildered, wondering why she was 
there in the first place. As she looked down at herself, she blushed 
profusely at the sight of her nudity. Then it suddenly hit her. She 
remembered drumming away at her study table when Tomoyo called inviting 
her to dinner. The fabulous night turned beautiful when Tomoyo confessed 
her love for Sakura, Sakura herself admitting her feeling for Tomoyo.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan...&quot;
Sakura blushed even more when she remembered more of last night&#39;s 
events. The first time they kissed, the softness of the other&#39;s touch, 
the heat of making love. She shuddered as she almost felt the dark 
haired girl suckling on her breast, and fingering her pussy. She shook 
her head violently as she felt herself getting warmed up, trying in vain 
to erase those erotic images in her head. She looked around some more 
and wondered where Tomoyo is.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan, Tomoyo-chan where are you?&quot;
&quot;Here, Sakura-chan, in the bathroom.&quot; a voice called back.
Sakura shivered as she heard Tomoyo&#39;s call, the sweetness of her voice 
filling and echoing in her head. She smiled and proceeded to where 
Tomoyo was. Sakura had no trouble covering her body with the blanket, 
finding that it clung to herself like a second skin. As she neared the 
bathroom, she wondered how their friends and family would take the news 
of their newfound love. Would they accept them for who they are and be 
happy for them or would disgust settle in and slowly choke them to 
death? Those thoughts loomed heavily on Sakura&#39;s head. Luckily and 
thankfully, Tomoyo left the bathroom door open. Were it closed, Sakura 
would have surely bumped and hurt herself. Sakura jumped back to reality 
as she felt the cold of the tiles underneath her feet. As she looked up, 
what she saw before her was a sight to behold. She gasped as she saw 
Tomoyo in a lovely blue bathrobe with white flower patterns on them. 
Tomoyo was bending over the bathtub, feeling the hot water with her 
hand. Tomoyo heard Sakura gasp, so she looked up and smiled sweetly at 
the sight of her.
&quot;Good morning Tomoyo-chan.&quot; Sakura greeted out of habit.
&quot;Good morning, lover.&quot; Tomoyo greeted back She grinned mischievously and 
started to chuckle.
&quot;Huh? What&#39;s so funny, Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura asked curiously. 
&quot;Take a look at the mirror, Sakura-chan.&quot; Tomoyo replied.
Sakura blinked and faced the mirror, discovering what Tomoyo was 
chuckling about.
&quot;Oh my! I&#39;m such a mess.&quot; Sakura exclaimed as she touched her cheeks, 
which were covered with dried juices. There were dried juices around and 
on her lips that made a trail down her chin. Some more were on her 
eyebrows and bangs, causing them to clump together. Sakura faced Tomoyo 
and smiled playfully.
&quot;You made this mess, Tomoyo-chan. This is your cum on my face.&quot;
Tomoyo smiled as well and approached Sakura.
&quot;I know, lover.&quot; she replied and gave Sakura a slow sensous kiss. Sakura 
kissed back feeling Tomoyo&#39;s tongue slip inside her mouth. She moaned as 
she inserted her own tongue as well in Tomoyo&#39;s mouth, wrapping around 
her tongue. They stayed like this for a few minutes, enjoying one 
another&#39;s taste. Just then Tomoyo broke the kiss.
&quot;I just remembered. Sakura-chan, we got to hide the sheets before mom or 
the maids see it.&quot;
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s do it.&quot; Sakura replied.
So out they went, while Sakura removed the stained sheets, Tomoyo took 
out some fresh ones and together placed the new sheets on the bed. The 
giggled as they rushed in the bathroom before anyone comes in and sees 
them. The bathroom was covered in white clouds of steam when they got 
inside. Sakura shut the door while Tomoyo laid the sheets on the floor 
next to the bathtub.
&quot;We&#39;ll take care of that later. Right now we better get ourselves 
cleaned up.&quot; Tomoyo said as she started to undo the knots that held her 
robe. Sakura, on the other hand, froze as she watched Tomoyo&#39;s every 
move. Tomoyo noticed the look and had an idea. Sakura-chan, could you 
help me with this knot? I can&#39;t seem to get it undone.&quot; Tomoyo asked.
Sakura nodded absentmindedly and untied Tomoyo&#39;s robe. At the same time 
Tomoyo pulled off the blanket off Sakura. When they were both naked, 
they stared at each other, smiled and giggled. Both girls had dried cum 
on their thighs, legs and nether region.
&quot;And I said I was a mess.&quot; Sakura snapped.
&quot;Well you are, since you practically have more cum on you than I do.&quot; 
Tomoyo replied naughtily.
&quot;No fair. You washed your face.&quot; Sakura pouted.
&quot;I woke up all covered in cum. What do you expect me to do? I totally 
forgot to wash my legs and pussy.&quot; Tomoyo said playfully. She took 
Sakura&#39;s hand and led her to the tub.
&quot;C&#39;mon. Get in.&quot;
They slowly got into the bathtub, letting their legs get used to the 
heat. The tub was big and can accommodate Tomoyo and Sakura with much 
space to spare. They slowly sat down as to not scald their bottoms. 
Sakura sat next to Tomoyo, enjoying the heat and contact of the water on 
her skin. She liked hot baths but never thought of having one with Tomoyo, 
her best friend and lover.
&quot;Doesn&#39;t this feel good?&quot; Tomoyo asked.
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; Sakura replied, who was visibly relaxed.
They became silent for a minute, enjoying the heat.
&quot;So, um... Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura hesitated.
&quot;Hmmm? What is it?&quot;
&quot;Well, I was thinking...&quot; Sakura didn&#39;t finish.
Tomoyo grew concerned.
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Sakura-chan? Is something bothering you?&quot;
Sakura swallowed before speaking up.
&quot;It&#39;s about our relationship.&quot;
Tomoyo released a shocked gasp.
&quot;What about it? Aren&#39;t you happy about us?&quot; Tomoyo asked frantically.
&quot;You got it all wrong, Tomoyo-chan,&quot; Sakura explained, &quot;I love you and 
this relationship was the best that ever happened to me.&quot;
Tomoyo sighed in relief but the look of concern didn&#39;t leave her.
&quot;So what&#39;s really bothering you?&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s um... how are we going to tell our family about us? I don&#39;t want my 
family to reject me.&quot;
Tomoyo sank in the water. That&#39;s really going to be a problem, she 
thought. Sakura kept on sighing as she thought about the consequences. 
She could see Chiharu, Rika, Naoko, Touya and her father pointing at her 
and telling her how disgusting she is. She groaned aloud as she held her 
head, shaking it violently.
&quot;What now, Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura asked.
&quot;Look Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo looked intently at Sakura, &quot;if they really love 
us, they&#39;ll accept us and be happy for us.&quot;
&quot;You think so?&quot;
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure.&quot;
Sakura found comfort in Tomoyo&#39;s reassurance.
&quot;Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right.&quot;
&quot;Of course I am. But for now...&quot; Tomoyo rested her head on Sakura&#39;s 
shoulder, &quot;For now let&#39;s keep this to ourselves.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot; Sakura replied lazily as she closed her eyes, feeling 
Tomoyo&#39;s soft hand hold hers.
&quot;You&#39;re really enjoying the heat, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Tomoyo asked once again.
&quot;Mmm-hmmm.&quot; Sakura replied.
&quot;Yeah? Well, this should feel better.&quot; Tomoyo said as she started to pinch 
Sakura&#39;s nipples.
&quot;Ahhh! To-Tomoyo-chan... What are you-?&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t you like this, Sakura-chan?&quot; Tomoyo asked seductively.
&quot;Of course I do. It&#39;s just that-&quot; Sakura&#39;s voice trailed off as Tomoyo 
sucked on her nipple, Tomoyo&#39;s teeth lightly scraping and nibbling it. 
Sakura became frantic. What if someone should check on them and see them 
in that situation?
&quot;Tomoyo-chan...p-please...what if-&quot; Sakura was unable to finish her 
sentence as she felt Tomoyo&#39;s silky fingers rub her delicate entrance.
&quot;Sakura-chan, what is it?&quot; Tomoyo asked
Sakura wasn&#39;t able to speak as she kept on moaning and gasping at Tomoyo&#39;s 
tender touch. The fire that fueled her that last evening has rekindled and 
taken over her, for in a fit of passion, she grabbed Tomoyo and hugged 
her, causing Tomoyo&#39;s finger to plunge in her pussy.
&quot;Aaaahhh!&quot;
Sakura screamed as she felt Tomoyo&#39;s finger intrude her private space. 
Tomoyo was very much surprised when Sakura wrestled her, feeling her 
finger go deep inside her bestfriend.
&quot;Oh! Sakura-chan!&quot; 
Tomoyo cried out as she felt Sakura rub her pussy and gently push in her. 
The hot water served as lubricant causing their fingers to easily slip 
inside. As Sakura rocked Tomoyo, the pleasure grew as Tomoyo&#39;s finger 
slip in and out of her pussy faster, harder and deeper. At the same time, 
Sakura&#39;s finger is going deeper inside Tomoyo. Their breasts rubbed 
against each other causing more pleasure. Tomoyo writhed in Sakura&#39;s arms, 
as did Sakura in Tomoyo&#39;s hold.
&quot;Uunnh! Uhhhh! Sakura-chan... ahhh!&quot; Tomoyo moaned as Sakura increased her 
tempo. Tomoyo twisted, curled and vibrated her finger inside Sakura. 
Sakura retaliated doing the same, twisting, and vibrating her finger. She 
kissed Tomoyo wrapping and flicking her tongue with Tomoyo&#39;s. Tomoyo was 
really enjoying this. As they kissed, their saliva trailed down their 
chins. Sakura moaned in Tomoyo&#39;s mouth as they kept masturbating each 
other. Tomoyo broke the kiss and spoke to Sakura in broken and ragged 
pants.
&quot;Uuuhhh...Sa-Sakura-chan, w-w-wait...&quot;
&quot;Huuhh? What-uh-is it?&quot; Sakura asked between rasps.
Tomoyo smiled as she kept on fingering Sakura.
&quot;Let&#39;s-uhhh-get out...of here.&quot; Tomoyo moaned.
Sakura didn&#39;t know why they wanted to leave the comfort of the hot water 
but still she complied. They rose, they&#39;re hands still stuffed between 
the other&#39;s legs. The absence of the water mattered little as their love 
juices kicked in, coating their fingers but nevertheless, their pussies 
still grasped and sucked on their fingers. As they lay on the sheets, they 
felt droplets of water trickle down their nude bodies. Their love juices 
trailed down their fingers, feeling all sticky and wet. The heat of their 
bodies pressed against each other, the feeling mof their love juices, it 
was very much like last night.
&quot;Uaaagh!&quot;
Sakura let out a cry as Tomoyo pumped harder, faster and deeper. Sakura 
pumped too, vibrating her finger inside Tomoyo&#39;s wet vagina. Tomoyo 
squirmed on top of Sakura as they both rocked their hips to increase the 
pleasure. Once again their nipples rubbed in direct contact. Their cries 
became louder and more frequent. They knew their moment was fast 
approaching and neither one wanted to disappoint the other by stopping 
now. Their breath came in ragged and forced pants as they continued to 
pump their fingers in and out. Sakura and Tomoyo felt like they were going 
to explode. They froze at the instance of their release.
&quot;I&#39;m cumming!&quot; Tomoyo screamed.
&quot;Ooohhh! Tomoyo-chan!&quot; Sakura screamed her lover&#39;s name.
Both girls got their orgasm at the same time. They felt their pussies 
clenching hard on each other&#39;s fingers as they shot out their stream of 
hot girl cum. They held each other for a few minutes, relishing the waves 
of their joint release. They were covered in sweat and cum but they didn&#39;t 
mind. Tomoyo slowly pulled her finger out Sakura&#39;s pussy and rolled off 
her. There they laid, breathing heavily.
&quot;That was very intense.&quot; Tomoyo said panting.
&quot;Yeah. Really.&quot; Sakura replied breathlessly.
They were silent for a moment, feeling spent and content.
Tomoyo laid her head on Sakura&#39;s chest.
&quot;You were going to tell me something?&quot; Tomoyo asked.
&quot;I was going to tell you to stop. What if someone should see us?&quot; Sakura 
said while running her fingers along Tomoyo&#39;s silky long hair.
&quot;But now I want to tell you how great you were.&quot;
&quot;Really? Thank you.&quot;
They both giggled.
&quot;I&#39;m the luckiest girl in the world.&quot; Tomoyo declared.
&quot;Hmmm? What makes you say that?&quot; Sakura asked.
&quot;Well, not all girls could have a beautiful card captor as a best 
friend... and lover.&quot; Tomoyo stated matter-of-factly.
&quot;Yeah. I guess you&#39;re right.&quot; Sakura agreed.
&quot;Of course I am.&quot; Tomoyo said as she started to run circles around her 
best friend&#39;s nipples. 
&quot;Hey! What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; Sakura asked in surprise.
&quot;What? I&#39;m not entitled for seconds?&quot; Tomoyo replied seductively.
Sakura&#39;s mouth fell open.
&quot;Again? But I&#39;m spent.&quot;
&quot;So what am I supposed to do about it?&quot; Tomoyo asked.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan, let&#39;s get cleaned up. They&#39;ll wonder what&#39;s keeping us.&quot;
&quot;No they won&#39;t. They&#39;ll think we overslept. So c&#39;mon, let&#39;s do it again.&quot;
&quot;How about later?&quot; Sakura negotiated.
&quot;No way, I can&#39;t wait that long.&quot; Tomoyo pouted.
Just then the bathroom door swung open. Sakura and Tomoyo gasped in 
surprise as they realized they forgot to lock the door. What they feared 
most has happened for before stood-
&quot;Mom!&quot; Tomoyo cried in shock.
They were both frantic as they used the stained sheets as cover. Sonomi 
looked at them in surprise, her mouth wide open.
&quot;So this is what&#39;s keeping you.&quot;
She turned around and started walking away.
&quot;Mom, wait!&quot; Tomoyo tried to explain.
&quot;Hurry and get cleaned up. Breakfast is almost ready.&quot; Sonomi said as she 
walked out the door. Tomoyo and Sakura were left alone, speechless. The 
stained bed sheets and the cum on their bodies in silent testimony of what 
they have done. Tomoyo got teary-eyed and was visibly shaking.
&quot;No! I don&#39;t want my mom to hate me.&quot; Tomoyo exclaimed as she burst in 
tears.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan, listen to me,&quot; Sakura said as she tried to comfort her 
friend, &quot;your mom loves you. Don&#39;t worry, she won&#39;t hate you.&quot;
&quot;What if she does hate me?&quot;
Sakura looked away so as not to let Tomoyo see the worry in her face.
&quot;Let&#39;s not think about it.&quot;
Sakura reached for Tomoyo and helped her up. They got in the tub and 
bathed in silence. The look of worry on their faces didn&#39;t fade even after 
bathing. Suitably dressed, they sat in the bed for a while.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan, are you ready?&quot; Sakura asked.
Tomoyo shook her head. Sakura just sighed.
&quot;I&#39;m scared, Sakura-chan.&quot; Tomoyo spoke finally.
&quot;I&#39;m scared too, but don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m with you.&quot;
&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;
Sakura smiled.
&quot;You taught me there&#39;s no good in being pessimistic. And besides I got a 
plan.&quot; Sakura explained.
&quot;Really? You got a plan? What is it?&quot; Tomoyo asked.
&quot;Simple. All I got to do is defend my love for you.&quot;
&quot;But promise me, if everything does go wrong, you&#39;ll still love me, okay?&quot;
&quot;I promise.&quot; Sakura replied.
So they rose to confront Tomoyo&#39;s mom, holding each other&#39;s hand and 
promising that whatever happens, they&#39;ll face it together.
