<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a>

<a href="../ccs/remaster2-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;Well aren&#39;t we just on time.&quot; Rebecca scoffs as Sakura comes barreling
into the classroom.

&quot;GOOD MORNING!!&quot;

&quot;---eck---&quot; (Keiko was too close to the door waiting for Sakura when she
burst in) &quot;---lower the volume ten notches why dontcha&#39;!&quot;

&quot;Morning, Sakura!&quot;

&quot;I made it---&quot; Sakura gasps, collapsing on the floor.

&quot;Well that&#39;ll teach you to wake up---&quot; (Sakura - &quot;EEP!!&quot; (surprised by
Mr. Terada she jumps, slamming into Keiko and knocking her backwards onto
her back)) &quot;---OW!!&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;Speaking of being wide awake---&quot;

&quot;---can it, Summers.&quot; Keiko growled as she stared at the ceiling. &quot;Needs
a new coat of paint.&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;Another study period?&quot; Rebecca scoffs.

Keiko - &quot;Oh don&#39;t blame me this time! I had nothing to do with first
period so don&#39;t go on me about it alright?!? Anyway this is so your
speed. Study period.&quot; (Keiko&#39;s eyes suddenly turn towards Sakura who
seems to be abit distracted). &quot;Hey, Sakura! Why were you late this
morning?&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Had to take a detour due to a movie shooting in New King
Penguin Park. Passed by a shrine I never saw before.&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;Your talking about the one on the hill? With the two statues of
fairies at the bottom of the stairs?&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Yes.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;I live near that shrine. It&#39;s actually kind of nice. Not as nice
as the small shrine in Vision Park, in New King Penguin Park (which used
to not be in that park if it wasn&#39;t for the real estates shuffle we&#39;ve
been seeing with buildings and such that&#39;s been happening the past few
years with Nekos buying fairly priced land and using magic to swap said
land with higher traffic land elsewhere).&quot; (blinks) &quot;Anyone else passed
by that particular shrine? Know the one we&#39;re---&quot; (Naoko raises her hand)
&quot;You?&quot;

&quot;Figures.&quot; Sakura laments, blushing as she remembers her friend&#39;s love of
such things.

Rebecca, however, didn&#39;t know about Naoko. &quot;What figures?&quot;

Naoko - &quot;It figures because I really like that sort of thing. Shrines,
temples, spirits and alien visitors from far away worlds.&quot;

&quot;You must be in quite a few fan clubs---&quot; (Rebecca asks as Naoko fishes
through her

bag and pulls out a fistful of cards) &quot;Lifetime member of the X-Files Fan
Club, member in good standing of the FarScape Fan Club, Whitestar Pilot
7--- oh, right, a Babylon 5 club--- a Screen Actor Guild (SAG) card... oh,
yeah, I have to call them back.&quot; (blinks) &quot;Oh. I appeared in the original
X-Files movie in a cameo I won in a contest and that card...&quot;

&quot;I get it, I get it--- sheesh.&quot; (Rebecca returns the cards to Naoko)
&quot;Your obsessed.&quot;

&quot;The charms form that shrine? They say it&#39;s really potent.&quot; (Naoko
changed the subject).

&quot;Charms again.&quot; Sakura whispers.

Keiko - &quot;What about charms (again)?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re supposed to grant wishes.&quot; (Naoko picks up the topic from Keiko
and runs with it).

At this Keiko scoffs, &quot;Don&#39;t believe everything you---&quot;

&quot;Do YOU mind? I&#39;m listening here!&quot; (Rebecca) &quot;Ignore her, go on.&quot;

Naoko - &quot;They&#39;re supposed to grant wishes. Like for tests, or love,all
diff---&quot;

&quot;LOVE?!?&quot;

Keiko nearly falls out of her chair, but quickly recovers, looking at
Sakura/Rebecca in dismay &quot;What&#39;s with you two? You&#39;d think both of your
love lives were in the toilet the way you jumped on that like a blood
wolf on a plate of New York steaks (rare)!&quot;

&quot;Those must be really convenient charms! Charms began---&quot; (Keiko muffles
Yamazaki before hec an utter another word, passing his &#39;book&#39; off to him)
&quot;Here. Re-read the entry you made on charms and then go stick your head
in a toilet or something (anything to shut you up).&quot;

(blinks, then grabs Yamazaki) &quot;But before you commit seppuku (if I got it
wrong, sue me, I haven&#39;t had the urge to commit suicide since the 50&#39;s),
why don&#39;t you tell everyone I WASN&#39;T responsible for study hall during
first period today.&quot;

Yama nodded his head, &quot;That&#39;s right. First period is study hall today
because Ms. Tsutsumi

is sick today.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Phwee?&quot;

&quot;So your not to blame for it this time, big whoop.&quot; Rebecca scoffs, &quot;Not
that we&#39;re going to be impressed by your character witness as you got a
born liar to vouch for you. Anyway we&#39;ll just have another study period
to look forward to when it&#39;s your turn to teach so what&#39;s the
difference.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;At least I&#39;m not boring the class to death with a dry, witless
lecture---&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;I HEARD THAT!!&quot;

Keiko - &quot;I know you did, I know---&quot;

Sakura looks rather confused by the whole thing.

* * * * * *

&quot;I really miss Tomo-chan when she&#39;s on these trips---&quot; Sakura laments.

Suddenly inspiration hits her. &quot;I&#39;ll buy two charms! One for me, one for
Tomo-chan, and I&#39;ll present it to her when she gets home!&quot;

As Sakura comes about down another street she slams into someone at the
corner.

&quot;Yow!&quot; (the woman, dressed in a body tight white/red uniform leaps back,
shocked by the collision) &quot;Sorry! I---&quot; she stops, and stares. The woman,
a full head taller than Sakura (topped with shoulder length dark hair),
looks on in confusion. She&#39;s wearing a white with red (and some black)
trim, with the emblem of a bird on the uniform&#39;s front. She regards
Sakura with confusion, then brief shock.

&quot;---oh no---&quot;

&quot;Phwee?&quot;

Quickly recovering, she gives Sakura a weak smile and whispers something
beneath her breath.

&quot;---too late now---&quot; (now she speaks up) &quot;Uhh--- you OK? I didn&#39;t mean to
ram into you---&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh---&quot; Sakura remarks, looking at the young woman in front of her,
abit taken back by her. &quot;Your blushing abit, are you OK? You just came
right out of nowhere and next thing I know bam and---&quot;

&quot;Gasp!&quot; (bows) &quot;I&#39;m really sorry for bumping into you like that!&quot;

&quot;?&quot; (shrugs) &quot;No problem. No harm done.&quot; (looks at Sakura) &quot;I bet there&#39;s
something you want, isn&#39;t there? I&#39;m right, aren&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;?Huh?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have any luck today. Maybe tomorrow.
Well---&quot; she waves as she turns, &quot;See you around.&quot;

She walks off without another word. As she walks away, her thoughts are
raging. &#39;Dammit! I knew I was going to have to see her but too soon! I&#39;m
not ready for this yet--- not after---&#39;

With a huff she shoves her worries into the back of her head, draws her
schedule out from her pocket, and once again starts going over her plans
for her first day of &quot;work&quot; tomorrow.

------

Even separated by great distance, one fact was still very clear to Tomoyo
Daidouji.

She still had to do her studywork. So, with Tomoyo (holographic) by her
side, the two studied, and talked about the day&#39;s events especially---

&quot;That sounds just like the way you first met Ms. Mitsuki, remember? And
she said you couldn&#39;t get what you were looking for? What was that?&quot;

Sakura blushes abit at the question, &quot;It&#39;s a secret.&quot; she whispers,
before turning the topic back to the strange woman. &quot;She said I wouldn&#39;t
get what I was looking for today, then she said &quot;See you around&quot; and
left.&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;You mean she might see you again?&quot;

Sakura - &quot;And with the math teacher gone it&#39;s likely she&#39;ll show up
tomorrow as the new teacher.&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;But Sakura, didn&#39;t that already happen once with Ms. Mitsuki?&quot;

Sakura - &quot;I guess, but I have a feeling she&#39;s going to repeat with Ms.
Mitsuki did and show up tomorrow.&quot;

Tomoyo sighs, &quot;I wish I was there. I&#39;d love to see Rebecca&#39;s reaction
when she shows up in class.&quot; (smiles) &quot;So what did she look like? Was she
as pretty as Ms. Mitsuki?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not as pretty as you, Tomo-chan.&quot;

&quot;Very diplomatic of you, Sakura-chan. Very---&quot; (the door knocks on both
sides) &quot;Come in.&quot;

On one side Light, the other side one of Tomoyo&#39;s bodyguards, both
bringing dessert. As the two thank them both leave the two to their
studies once again. &quot;I wish we could taste what the other&#39;s dessert is
like, just like when your home---&quot;

Tomoyo smiles, touching Sakura&#39;s cheek with her hand softly, &quot;I&#39;ll be
home soon, don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll be able to nip from each other&#39;s desserts
in no time.&quot; (smiles) &quot;Then you&#39;d have to worry about me stealing your
dessert.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d relish that as long as your with me---&quot;

&quot;Oh Sakura-chan.&quot; Tomoyo draws Sakura close and holds her tight, smiling
at how beautiful she was even in holographic form (from her POV). &quot;How
could I ever make it through these trips if I couldn&#39;t spend these nights
with you in this way my precious.&quot;

After a minute of cuddling they go back to eating dessert, making it a
game to describe to each other the flavors they were tasting as they ate.

* * * * * *

The next day.

&#39;Here it comes.&#39; Sakura thinks to herself as Mr. Terada makes his
announcement.

Sure enough it is exactly as Sakura thought it would be. They had a
substitute.

And sure enough, as she thought, the mysterious woman from yesterday
walked in.

That&#39;s when things went south.

Keiko, who usually lounged in her chair listening only half-heartily to
everything that happened in class, suddenly sat up at the sight of the
new teacher.

Rebecca, who also lounged (head lowered as if she was going to collapse
into a deep sleep at any second) suddenly sprang to life as she saw the
new teacher, her eyes wide with shock.

&quot;My name is Catherine Piccadello.&quot;

&quot;---it can&#39;t be---&quot; Rebecca hissed under her breath.

As soon as a free period came up to go outside the three gathered with
Nina &amp; Eliza (who saw everything since they couldn&#39;t monitor Mirra&#39;s love
life while she was out of school) to discuss things.

Sakura - &quot;What&#39;s wrong with Ms. Piccadello? Is she---&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know, do you?&quot; Rena grumbled, looking at Sakura as if she just
fell off a passing bus a few scant moments before (and right in front of
her at that). &quot;Catherine Piccadello. The Raven of the 21st Century.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s a---&quot;

&quot;Ravens are the heavy duty guardians of both the Realm of Dreams and the
waking world.&quot; Nina answers, already knowing the answer to Sakura&#39;s half
asked question. &quot;They&#39;re at the top of the &quot;food chain&quot; so to speak, with
only the Goddesses being more powerful. Their rank even outlevels Keiko &amp;
Rena here as Judgments. They&#39;re the highest level of power that can be
brought to bear.&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s my problem!&quot; Rebecca started again, &quot;Ravens weren&#39;t supposed
to be brought into this mission, and if one was coming I&#39;d have thought
it&#39;d been Lazarus, NOT Piccadello! What the hell is a maverick Raven like
her being assigned to this mission anyway?!?&quot;

&quot;Simply observing, nothing more.&quot;

Everyone spins about to find Catherine standing behind them, staring at
them with a smile on her face and all the answers already in her head.
&quot;You don&#39;t really feel that threatened by me, do you? I wish I had a 1000
credits every time someone felt unnecessarily threatened by my presence.&quot;

Silence reigns as everyone tries to regather their wits.

&#39;I wish Tomoyo was here. I don&#39;t know what to do!&quot;

* * * * * *

Catherine leans back, staring at the sky listlessly as she tries to work
it out in her head, &quot;Look, I&#39;m NOT trying to muscle in on anyone&#39;s
assignment. The Goddesses simply thought an observer who occasionally
pitched in---&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;Ah-hah!&quot;

Catherine - &quot;---when NEEDED, and not just because, was necessary.&quot;
(sighs) &quot;Look, I&#39;m not trying to get in either your face or Keiko&#39;s, so
why don&#39;t you cut me some slack Summers? After all, if you&#39;re on guard
then this won&#39;t work out very well for either of us.&quot; (stops and looks
around) &quot;I thought there was another---&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;How did you get so close to us without Sakura sensing you?&quot;

Catherine - &quot;Oh, that. I&#39;m wearing a suppressor bracelet now (blanks out
my power signature making it hard to detect), but this morning it was all
willpower.&quot;

&quot;Willpower?&quot; Sakura asks. &quot;Like in DragonBall Z.&quot; Catherine replies, &quot;I
simply pushed my power levels down so that they weren&#39;t detectable. I do
that a few times a day just to be in practice just in case I need to do
it for something important.&quot; (snaps fingers) &quot;There&#39;s supposed to be
another one here, Tomoyo, where is she?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s on a business trip.&quot; (Sakura) &quot;Oh.&quot; (shrugs) &quot;Guess I&#39;ll meet her
later then. Sakura---&quot; (points at Sakura) &quot;---Sakura Kinomoto, right?&quot;
(Sakura blushes and nods her head quickly) &quot;Your creating quite the buzz
in the hierarchy. Even the Goddesses are talking about you. It&#39;s simply
amazing the kind of focus your getting. Oh, did you find what you were
looking for yesterday?&quot;

Sakura - &quot;N-no-- no I didn&#39;t.&quot;

Catherine - &quot;Eh? She was right again. Dang that&#39;s accurate stuff.&quot;

Sakura looked confused, &quot;Who was right again?&quot; Sakura asks, suddenly
feeling a hand on her shoulder, and a familiar presence near her, &quot;That&#39;d
be me.&quot; Sakura didn&#39;t need to look to know that voice, she turns and
comes face to face with Ms. Mitsuki. &quot;It&#39;s been awhile, Sakura, you look
well. And today? You&#39;ll have better luck.&quot;

&quot;Eck. It&#39;s the walking magic eight ball of doom.&quot; Keiko spits out,
slumping her shoulders and looking rather pouty at the whole turn of
events. &quot;What brings you back anyway?&quot;

Kaho - &quot;I&#39;m just back--- (magic eight ball?)&quot; Kaho &amp; Sakura gaze at each
other, waiting for the other to say something--- Keiko takes this
opportunity to stretch, and yawn. &quot;We&#39;re not unduly keeping you awake,
are we?&quot; Catherine asks, shaking her head as she watches Keiko shuffle
her feet and stifle another yawn as she stands watching Kaho/Sakura stare
at each other for what seemed like the longest time. &quot;I could fall asleep
watching them stare at each other---&quot;

&quot;Keiko?&quot; It was Eve, her long hair wavering slightly as she ran up to
Keiko and the others, &quot;You promised you&#39;d sit in on my music discussion
in my class today, yet you forgot your flute back at home!&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; (Keiko blushes) &quot;Damn! I knew I forgot something---&quot; (kisses Eve on
the cheek) &quot;Thanks.&quot; Eve looks at the others, and notices--- &quot;Hello
Cathy.&quot; Eve remarks glumly, closing her eyes. &quot;You&#39;ve gotten bigger,
Evie. Let your hair grow out too.&quot; Before Keiko could ask, Eve was
already walking away with her in her grip. &quot;Where are we going? (are we
there yet?)&quot; &quot;?&quot; Sakura blanks out, confused as to the whole situation.

* * * * * *

Today, Eve was teaching a lesson on music appreciation and basic skills
with hands on demonstrations and lessons. Sakura &amp; Keiko however were
focused on other things.

&quot;So, uh--- Eve knew Ms. Piccadello once.&quot;

Keiko shrugged, &quot;I had no clue about that, Sakura.&quot; (sighs) &quot;Frankly?
I&#39;ve never seen Eve so upset and bent out of shape over seeing someone
before. That shocked me.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;She didn&#39;t seem very shaken up. A little bit grumpy maybe.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Trust me. She was really freaked over it. Usually Eve would be
smiles and warm handshakes and hugs, but today she was totally icebox
level cold. Somethings&#39; up between those two and I want to know---&quot;
(blinks) &quot;Hey, Rebecca, you know anything about---&quot;

&quot;STOP BOTHERING ME!!&quot; Rebecca silently hisses beneath her breath, &quot;I
can&#39;t even walk in the same direction as you without being dragged into
your conversations!! And no, I can&#39;t make heads or tail of this stupid
contraption! God I hated music class when I was younger and I still hate
it!!&quot;

Sakura - &quot;It&#39;s not that hard. Just take that end (the end I&#39;m pointing
to) and blow it. It&#39;s not---&quot; (both Sakura and Keiko go pale) &quot;---oh
god---&quot;

&quot;---it&#39;s not working---&quot; Rebecca whispers. &quot;---maybe because your not
blowing it right---&quot; (Keiko&#39;s eyes bulge as she quickly grabs the
instrument away from her) &quot;---forget it! I&#39;ve been traumatized enough for
one period! Just bow out graciously and we won&#39;t have to watch you freak
out the class.&quot; (Keiko slumps onto her desk) &quot;And I thought she wouldn&#39;t
even have the inkling to do THAT when I used the word blow.&quot;

Nothing more was said on the topic.

* * * * * *

Dining Room (secret observation base beneath Sakura&#39;s high school)

Eve sits at one of the tables staring listlessly at nothing as she waits
for--- something. &quot;Drink?&quot; Eve looks up, beholding Keiko&#39;s face as she
reaches out carefully to take the soda from her hand. &quot;Thanks. Anything
to---&quot; (Keiko puts a tray of food before her) &quot;---thanks.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;So what&#39;s with you and Cathy anyway?&quot;

Eve sighs and glances around the room, &quot;Is it really that obvious?&quot;

&quot;If it was anymore obvious I&#39;d have thought you were having a hot side
dish relationship wise with her.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t that hot, and it wasn&#39;t that special either.&quot; Eve admits,
munching on her food as she sulks, &quot;The day I met you, that&#39;s when things
got hot and special.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;How diplomatic as always, but if you and Cathy had a special
something you can let me know about it...&quot;

Eve - &quot;I promise you, it wasn&#39;t that special--- or permanent. Not like
us.&quot;

&quot;Ok. I&#39;ll drop it.&quot; Keiko sighs, going back to her food. Suddenly she
felt Eve touch her leg with one of her hands. &quot;I&#39;ll make it up to you---&quot;
Keiko smiles, knowing what she had on her mind.

* * * * * *

&quot;If I roll to my death trying to descend this staircase on the way down,
it&#39;s all your fault.&quot; Nina gripes, her body slumped as she finally
reaches the top of the stairs onto the main grounds of the temple. &quot;For
god&#39;s sake I can&#39;t barely feel my legs! I&#39;m tired! I&#39;m out of breath!
This bag is too heavy! I can&#39;t go on! Roll me over, I&#39;m done for! (Have
Eliza sell my eggs to the highest bidder. Everyone should be so blessed
to have a child that looks like me--- for the right price mind you.)&quot;

Sakura - &quot;You didn&#39;t have to come up here with me to get the charms.&quot;

Nina - &quot;And what makes you think that I didn&#39;t want a charm for me and
Eliza, Snoozer? I have just as much right to some of them charms as you
do so---&quot; (gasps for breath) &quot;---oh, boy! Don&#39;t do that---&quot;

&quot;Sigh---&quot; Suddenly, a sense of something nearby. &quot;---what---&quot; &quot;I feel
kida strange. Like there&#39;s a Clow card nearby.&quot; &quot;---ah man---&quot; Nina
quickly straightens out and starts power walking towards the buildings,
&quot;Time&#39;s of the essence! Don&#39;t dawdle! It&#39;s charms or bust! Move it!
Before things go crazy!&quot;

&quot;HEY WAIT UP!!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; (both turn around towards the sound of the voice behind them)
&quot;Rebecca?&quot;

Rebecca, as out of breath as Nina was, staggers towards the two as she
huffs and puffs, &quot;Aw man!&quot; (gasps for breath) &quot;It&#39;s days like this I wish
I actually use the treadmill in my living room for something other than
as a place to hang my clothes!&quot;

&quot;So you came up here to buy a charm to,eh?&quot; (Nina scoffs) &quot;What&#39;s with
you? Your relationship really in the toilet like Keiko said it was?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t sass me!&quot; Rebecca spat, &quot;Look at you! I&#39;d think YOUR relationship
was the one in the gutter the way you ran up here like a madwoman to get
a charm!&quot;

Nina - &quot;Up yours. It&#39;s cute and it&#39;s a sign of affection to---&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;--and that&#39;s my point exactly! Why can&#39;t I get one without my
relationship being in the so called damn---&quot;

The world warps and spins, as a huge miniature maze rises from the ground
behind them.

Rebecca - &quot;---in the gutter, and what the hell---&quot;

&quot;You know the Maze card, don&#39;t you? A little smaller than usual but then
again---&quot; A shadowy figure steps out into the light near the staircase,
Little sitting on her shoulder. To her side the Big card&#39;s humanoid form
stands next to her (Big, dressed in her usual bright clothes, makes for
an imposing figure, a full head/shoulders taller than the smaller dark
garbed female next to her). The female who spoke wore a dark uniform,
with short jet black hair, was stared at Sakura with dark piercing eyes
(her gaze held sharply as she regarded the Card Captor). &quot;---I had help.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Who the---&quot;

&quot;My name is Anarchist. Assassin Guild. I can&#39;t kill you, Mistress of the
Cards, just so you know...&quot; she announced as she held a hand up like a gun,
&quot;shooting&quot; it as she spoke, &quot;Your protected quite nicely by Code 8 and
all that. But still that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t stop you.&quot; (waves her hand
over the field ahead of them) &quot;One duel, if you win I&#39;ll give over the
two cards I managed to secure through hook and crook.&quot;

&quot;And if you win?&quot; Nina asks. &quot;I keep my three playmates. Nothing too
stressful, eh? Well, let&#39;s shelf that and start the duel.&quot;

&quot;Agreed.&quot; (Sakura steps up and stands ready, drawing out her key) &quot;Let&#39;s
duel.&quot;

&quot;Wait a sec!&quot; Anarchist cries out, motioning towards the board, &quot;I meant
with this holoboard and NOT Clow Cards.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Pheew?&quot;

Anarchist - &quot;Give your key to Nina for her gauntlets. Don&#39;t worry, Maze
will manipulate the environment so all we have to do is give our troops
their marching orders.&quot; (Anarchist watches with a slight glint in her eye
as Sakura exchanges her Clow cards and key to Nina for her gauntlets).
&quot;You sure about this?&quot;

Sakura - &quot;I have to. If I want to get those cards back I have to.&quot;

&quot;Alright then, you&#39;re ready to get to it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m ready, I&#39;m ready. How am I supposed to do this anyway with--&quot;

Suddenly the world shift and Sakura finds herself inside Maze staring up
at a giant Nina and Rebecca. &quot;Oh no.&quot;

Anarchist - &quot;I&#39;m ready too.&quot; the voice sounded, Sakura turning to notice
Anarchist was nowhere to be found on the other side of the board, she had
shrunk down too. &quot;First off, as you notice I&#39;ve taught maze a new trick.&quot;
her voice boomed in the maze, &quot;Instead of a usual labyrinth it&#39;s laid
itself out like a solvable maze. Doors will appear as you come into
visual range of them. Your friends up there can only peer into rooms
you&#39;ve entered but can see all the corridors clearly, so they&#39;ll be
helpful to you in navigating you but can&#39;t give you a leg up on things
I&#39;m doing in rooms. It&#39;s a relatively simple maze so we won&#39;t have to
fuss with too much details. Other than that kill the most creatures,
ready?&quot;

&quot;Must I kill?!?&quot; Sakura cried, to which her tormentor said &quot;...what? Are
you..&quot; (sighs) &quot;It&#39;s NOT real! It&#39;s fake! Fake! It&#39;s... oh for goddesses
sake it&#39;s FAKE! No kill, alright? Sheesh!&quot; (silence) &quot;Is that alright
with you or do I have to kiddify this any further?!?&quot;

Sakura shakes her head quickly, &quot;No! No! I&#39;m Ready.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s duel. Oh, and if you lose I&#39;ll take Big and Little, and you
can have the maze to have fun in to insure you don&#39;t try to do anything
while I escape. If you solve it it&#39;s all yours--- if you solve it.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;WHAT?!?&quot;

&quot;Too late to back out now, you said your good to go so we&#39;re going.&quot;

Sakura begins to regret acting so rashly.

Sakura - 4000LP

Anarchist - 4000LP

Sakura - &quot;What&#39;s this?!?&quot; (pointing at the points)

Anarchist - &quot;Oh. Nothing. Just for scoring, that&#39;s all... cough... I think.
Well let&#39;s go!&quot;

Sakura - &quot;PWHEEE!!&quot;
