Sakura couldn&#146;t sleep. She had just woken up from a particularly vivid
&#147;vision&#148;.

She knew she should be focusing on it, but it was so strong in her mind
that she could remember it without much effort, but still she had to
write it down (she missed on the warnings of a few visions in the past
because she didn&#146;t write it down and it&#146;s something she hasn&#146;t stopped
regretting since).

As she finishes putting her thoughts to paper she sighs, looking over at
Tomoyo, smiling. She looked so beautiful while she slept, as if not a
care in the world troubled her in her sleep. Once that wasn&#145;t the case,
but ever since that incident on the ice her visions had lessened and
lessened. They were still there in some respects, but they didn&#145;t affect
her as much anymore.

Sakura&#146;s hand gently brushes away a few hairs away from her forehead, 
her face so peaceful as she slept quietly next to her.

The notes in Sakura&#146;s hand drew her attention back, her vision laid out
in writing---

------

Tokyo Tower

It was night, and yet Lunaris glowed brightly in the sky above--- it was
then she realized that it had to be the past, because the moon was
sitting before a real sun--- in eclipse.

It was that day, the last day with Eriol and---

A dark shape flew past her, causing Sakura to tense. But instead of
Eriol&#146;s servant Spiner Sun, it turned out to be a man in black as he
slams into a tree out of breath.

&#147;JACK GET UP!!&#148; a woman yelled from behind, causing Sakura to snap about
to a sight she thought she&#146;d never see. Above, in the air, two figures
drifted about each other, striking at each other with staff and bare
hands looking for an opening in the other&#146;s defenses. One was obviously
Eriol, the other---

&#147;Catherine?&#148;

She tensed her muscles, waiting for him to take another swing with his
staff, powered to full, before she dodged and shot back at him with a
full charged energy blast knocking him out of the air and into the 
ground hard. &#147;---&#148; she sneered (but too far away for Sakura to hear her 
words, raising one hand into the air, flattening the palm upwards 
towards the sky. &#147;EVISCERATOR---&#148; (a energy disc formed in the air above 
her hand, charging to full) &#147;---DISC!!&#148; she screamed, whipping her arm 
about and launching the disc straight down at Eriol, nearly cutting him 
in two before he teleported away leaving the disc to cut into concrete 
where Eriol once laid.

Suddenly, another form flies past her, rolling onto the ground
unconscious as a new person comes into the open. It was Eliza, her face
slightly bloodied as she wipes the liquid from her lower face, teeth
clenched. &#147;No gender thing vs. multi gender girl? No contest.&#148;

Though she remarked in a flippant manner, she wasn&#146;t in a witty mood
right now, her body shaking abit and signs of blood on her uniform shows
she had a fierce fight with Eriol&#146;s other servant. From a distance she
could hear more fighting but turned to focus again on the fight between
Eriol &amp; Catherine. She was too far to hear their words, she could only
see them talking as they caught their breath. She wished she could move
closer to hear, but she didn&#146;t seem to want to move. Her limbs wouldn&#146;t
obey her at all.

Catherine charged Eriol all out, his hands barely able to catch her&#146;s as
she rushes him, their powers igniting the air about them as they 
struggle against each other in mid air, Catherine&#146;s face shrouded in a 
murderous expression as she screamed at him, but her words failed to 
reach Sakura&#146;s ears.

From behind her she heard a shriek and---

------

That was it. She stopped writing at that point because she woke up 
before she saw anymore.

The memories of the dream was beginning to fade, so Sakura felt 
reassured that she did the right thing by writing her thoughts down. Her
handwriting was a little sloppy, and she jotted things down in a bit of 
a rush, but still the general idea of what the vision showed her was 
here on paper. Proof positive that Nina wasn&#146;t always right about her 
when it came to things like this.

Then, suddenly, thoughts of her making love to Tomoyo popped into her
mind wiping out the last of the memories. She sighed, lying back down as
she remembered those tingly lovely feelings. Maybe Nina was right about
one thing, she was easily distracted these days. Unconsciously she let
out a low slow moan, her hands rubbing her breasts, pinching at her
nipples as she did. The memories were very addictive.

&#147;You look happy.&#148; she heard a voice whisper, making her freeze up, &#147;Am I
missing anything?&#148;

&#147;---hoe---&#148; Sakura whined, realizing that Tomoyo was awake, staring at
her from her side of the bed with a gentle smile on her lips and eyes
focused on Sakura&#145;s hands, &#147;I could have done that for you. You didn&#145;t
have to start without me---&#148;

&#147;I---I didn&#145;t want to--- wake you---&#148; she stammered, words failing her 
as she tried to talk but only gasped and choked on words slowly getting 
the meaning out as she spoke. &#147;I--- I was remembering earlier and--- 
well and---&#148; Tomoyo picks up the notepad and reads it (reading light on) 
while Sakura sits there staring, sweatdropping as she watched. As she 
finishes she nods her head, closes the book, and turns her gaze back to 
Sakura. &#147;Bad visions?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry---&#148; she whispered, head lowered, &#147;I---&#148;

Her words vanish as Tomoyo&#146;s lips press to her own, silencing her
explanation in a kiss.

&#147;You&#145;re so sweet, but I don&#145;t want you to hesitate in sharing your
problems with me.&#148;

&#147;---why---&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan---&#148; Tomoyo responds, holding the brown haired girl&#146;s hands
as she speaks to her, &#147;I want to be there for you, and if there&#146;s
anything troubling you all you have to do is ask and I&#146;ll help you 
anyway I can. You know I will.&#147;

&#147;I don&#146;t want to be a burden to you---&#148; Sakura moaned, head lowered only
for Tomoyo to raise it up (two fingers held firmly beneath her chin) so
the two locked eye contact. &#147;You&#145;ll never be a burden to me, 
Sakura-chan, never.&#148;

&#147;---Tomo-chan---&#148;

Tomoyo draws Sakura close, holding her tight as she speaks, &#147;No matter
what we&#146;ll always be there for each other, OK?&#148;

Silence reigns as the two hold each other, their feelings being 
expressed in ways that didn&#146;t need voice for conveyance. They each 
understood each other, and that&#146;s all that mattered.

&#147;One day we&#146;ll be married. One day. When you and I are--- and we&#145;ll live
happily ever after.&#148; Tomoyo whispers, her arms holding Sakura tightly. 
&#147;I wish we could marry today.&#148; she sighs, knowing that they agreed to a 
date already in their hearts. When the cards were all recaptured, and 
changed back into Star Cards, then they would marry (when peace was 
restored and everything was right with the world again).

Their hands strayed, lowering to their sides, and then their hips,
brushing of fingers against each girl&#146;s soft naked thighs. &#147;Then we&#145;ll
give Mirra away as she marries Hikaru, our beautiful daughter marrying
her beloved and then---&#148;

&#147;HOE???&#148;

Two fingers gently press against her lips. &#147;Later, Sakura-chan, I&#145;ll
explain later.&#148;

Sakura wanted to know more about this announcement, but one look at
Tomoyo said to her that this wasn&#146;t the time to ask, their bodies 
falling back into the bed as they kissed and rubbed their bodies 
together, their passions igniting again as they came closer and closer 
together---

------

December 31st, 2002 (Morning)

The announcement was not far in coming, and one person was disappointed
in it&#146;s delivery.

&#147;No fair.&#148; Nina remarked glumly, &#147;We didn&#146;t even get to see all this?
Nuts!&#148;

Several hours have passed and it was now daylight. As everyone gathered
in the kitchen for breakfast Mirra and Hikaru were relating their
decision to become engaged to anyone who&#146;ll listen (which was a great
deal of people in the house). Sakura was confused while Tomoyo sat by 
her side comforting her lovely (though befuddled) significant other.

&#147;It sounded quite sweet and beautiful.&#148; Eliza noted, smiling at the two
happy young women, &#147;I&#146;m sure you&#146;ll both be quite happy on your wedding
day---&#148; (winks at Nina) &#147;---just as we&#146;ll be on our wedding day. Right?&#148;

&#147;Right---&#148; Nina nods, blushing at the sudden shift of attention by 
Eliza. &#147;---uh, so, what are we doing today? It being New Year&#146;s Eve and 
all that. We&#145;re going to party, right?&#148;

Fuu entered the room and bowed slightly, drawing Sakura&#145;s attention away
from Mirra/Hikaru for a few seconds, &#147;We have visitors this morning. A
Mrs. &amp; Mrs. Shai&#146;zhan to see Sakura.&#148;

At this Nina scoffs, leaning back in her chair. &#147;Gee, wonder who THAT
could be.&#148;

&#147;Pwhee?&#148; Sakura muttered, confused even more than she was a minute ago.

As Fuu leaves the kitchen Meilin and Xai Shar enter, all smiles. Meilin
was wearing casual pants and a red dragon t-shirt with cute matching red
shoes, Xai Shar was wearing her usual uniform (as Keiko &amp; Rena often did
whether they were working or not). &#147;Meilin?&#148; Sakura gasps, confused,
&#147;Who---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s their future married last name isn&#146;t it.&#148; Nina noted, looking
straight at Meilin. &#147;Shai&#146;zhan is a Palominian name--- your changing 
your last name?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a beautiful last name!&#148; Meilin huffed, bowing slightly to Tomoyo 
as she entered, &#147;Good morning, remember my promise?&#148;

&#147;I remember.&#148; Tomoyo nods, &#147;We&#146;re going to celebrate your wedding
engagement today. Congratulations.&#148;

&#147;Hoe??&#148; (Sakura replied, barely remembering the event though Tomoyo
remembered)

&#147;Hoe.&#148; (Nina repeated, scoffingly)

Eliza shifts her weight in her chair to bring her attention to
Mirra/Eliza, &#147;That&#146;s great! You two can celebrate your engagement today
too!&#148; Both girls blushed at the sudden attention Meilin &amp; Xai Shar gave
them as they turned to look at the two. Suddenly Meilin smiles and gives
Mirra a slight smack on the back as she laughed abit. If this was meant
to settle down the two&#146;s nerves? It didn&#146;t help one bit.

&#147;Let&#146;s go downstairs and set up then.&#148; Nina suddenly announced, taking
the spotlight off of the two (to their relief). As they walked out of 
the kitchen, Mirra seemed confused. &#147;But we&#146;re already downstairs.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re going down to the holochamber. We can set the celebration up down
there.&#148;

&#147;Phwee?&#148; Mirra whispered, in trademark Sakura fashion.

------

The holochamber was already on when they entered.

The setting was inside of Tokyo Tower, the observation deck now set up
for a party with tables of food and a karaoke machine, and there was 
also a huge TV set to one side with ample seating and a few smaller sets 
to another side with video games hooked to them. &#147;I like to be prepared 
just in case.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s been planning this for weeks.&#148; Eliza whispers, cheeks blushing as
she watches Nina hustle about making sure everything was in it&#146;s proper
place.

Mirra felt someone grasp her hand, and realized it was Hikaru. She 
seemed a little nervous about the setting, but quickly smiled and waved 
off Mirra&#146;s concerns with a wave of her free hand. Mirra nodded her head 
and went back to looking around. Hikaru was worried, but she always 
tried to shield it when Mirra was around. And she accused her of hiding 
things. Mirra shook her head briefly as she pushed those thoughts away 
for the time being. When she was ready she would say what was troubling 
her, but for now she just wanted to spend the day with Hikaru and enjoy 
herself. That&#146;s it.

&#147;The food&#146;s real by the way, I just used the replicator to set the
buffet. Help yourselves and I&#146;ll get some of the events started so 
people can relax. Remember it&#146;s a party today so everyone have fun!&#148;

As the groups began to break apart to try some of the food or one of the
play areas, Hikaru pulled Mirra to one of the tables for a bite to eat.
Feeling abit famished herself she followed, mouth watering abit as she
did.

------

Eventually, someone had to ask the burning question of the day.

&#147;So, whose tying the knot first?&#148;

&#147;Phwee?&#148; Sakura blanked out, eyes growing wide.

&#147;Is there an echo in here? I keep hearing that same noise over and over
again---&#147; Nina remarks with a slightly nasty expression on her face,
which only vanished the minute Eliza tapped the green haired woman on 
the head. Eventually the question was going to come up, and it would 
have to be Nina that would ask the question on everyone&#146;s mind. As they 
sat around the table eating lunch, their eyes bounced from person to 
person waiting for the first one to answer that question. The group 
consisted of the three marrying couples in question (Sakura/Tomoyo, 
Nina/Eliza and Meilin/Xai Shar). Meilin was decked out on a couch lying 
contently in the taller Palominians&#146; gentle grip using her breasts as 
pillows, the two plucking crackers &amp; cheese from a tray on the table 
near to them. Sakura and Tomoyo sat side by side, and so did Eliza/Nina. 
As Nina finished asking the question, all eyes roamed about as everyone 
looked at each other. Eliza was first to speak. &#147;Nina wanted our wedding 
to be a Christmas thing so we&#146;re having ours on Christmas Eve.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re marrying on May 15th (Xai&#146;s birthday).&#148; Meilin offered.

&#147;---hoe---&#148; Sakura face faulted, looking nervous as everyone turned to
look for her answer, of which she presently had none to give. Tomoyo
quickly &#147;steps&#148; in and covers her, &#147;We haven&#146;t decided yet.&#148;

&#147;Is it going to be this year?&#148; Xai asked, only to receive a warming 
smile (but not answer) from Tomoyo. &#147;We&#146;ll let you know when we 
decided.&#148;

&#147;Whatever.&#148; Nina relented, dropping the subject for the time being. &#147;How
many more cards does Sakura need to seal anyway?&#148;

Sakura suddenly blanked out, her face going as expressionless as it 
could possibly get. Once again she had been asked a question that she 
wasn&#146;t ready for. &#147;What?! You mean you don&#146;t even know??&#148;

&#147;I wasn&#146;t keeping count!&#148; Sakura cried out, defending herself. It&#146;s 
true. She was more focused on Tomoyo than the amount of cards she had 
sealed since the beginning, though off hand she would have guessed 
about a  dozen or so cards to date.

&#147;Sigh---&#148; (Nina began counting cards on her fingers) &#147;Let&#146;s see--- Jump,
Fly, Illusion, Create---&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t forget to minus six cards for those who became human.&#148; Tomoyo
added, to which Nina scowled, &#147;I know that! I know--- made me lose 
count. 1-2-3-4---&#148;

Silence. Sakura and Tomoyo exchanged glances as they waited for a reply.

&#147;Anytime today, Einstein.&#148; Keiko called out from another nearby table,
listening in the whole time. &#147;SHUT IT!&#148; Nina screeches, counting again
(lost her count again). Finally, which much fanfare she came up with the
number--- &#147;You captured 13 regular Clow Cards (unlucky number 13!)&#148;

&#147;Is that it? Not counting fan cards--- I---&#148; (Sakura bows her head)
&#147;---it&#146;s 13 cards.&#148;

&#147;Unlucky number 13.&#147; Nina corrected, glancing about at the others
nervously. Keiko, on the other hand, overhearing the conversation from
her seat, huffs her breath. &#147;13 cards out of a possible 46? That&#146;s only 
a bit over 25%!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;M SORRY!!&#148; Sakura cries, her shoulders slumping as Tomoyo pulls her
over to console her.

&#147;Can you do better?&#148; Nina asks, turning around to look at Keiko. &#147;You
haven&#146;t caught card one.&#148;

&#147;Neither have you so don&#146;t go on about my catching skills! Why I---&#148;

&#147;Why you nothing.&#148;

&#147;Oh shut up. You and your &#147;unlucky number 13&#148;!&#148;

&#147;Waahh!!&#148; Sakura blurts out, eyes tearing up as Tomoyo redoubles her
efforts to calm her.

&#147;Your making Sakura upset. Cut it out.&#148;

&#147;Ignore them.&#148; Xai Shar tells Sakura, her strong hand gently patting the
distraught Clow Card Mistress on her back. &#147;They&#145;re just bickering like
little girls and have no sense of---&#148;

&#147;WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?&#148; (Keiko &amp; Nina)

&#147;Never mind.&#148;

&#147;You OK, Sakura-chan?&#148; Tomoyo whispers, wiping the few tears from
Sakura&#146;s cheeks as she nods her head briefly. &#147;I guess--- I&#146;m sorry---&#147;

&#147;There&#146;s nothing to be sorry about.&#148; Tomoyo assures her, quickly 
glancing over at the others as she speaks, &#147;Your doing the best you can 
under the circumstances.&#148;

&#147;I don&#145;t feel like I&#145;m doing my best.&#148; Sakura lamented, settling back
down to rest her head on Tomoyo&#146;s strong and supportive shoulders. &#147;I
wish I was as good a magician as everyone thinks I am.&#147; Suddenly Sakura
stops, and thinks for a second, &#147;Power &amp; Fight wouldn&#146;t have run away
from me if I was a better mistress to them.&#147;, Tomoyo sighs, giving 
Sakura a big hug as she chides Sakura gently, &#147;They did what they felt 
was right. Nobody ran away from you. You&#146;re the greatest.&#148;

&#147;Thank you, Tomoyo-chan.&#148;

------

Day turned to night, outside as well as in the holochamber.

The &#147;sky&#148; in the room was now glimmering with &#147;Stars&#148; (distant dream
moons) in the hours between dusk and the time when the planet&#146;s rotation
swung it into view of the Central Hub. Everyone was in party mood still
as they counted the hours slowly to midnight.

Each minute that drew the hour closer made the moment all the more
exciting.

The game systems were in hot use as the day&#146;s &#147;tournaments&#148; were rolling
along. By now enough was played to make a place for the winners and not
so lucky players (who were having a hard time winning) to face off
against each other.

Umi, Gaia, Light/Dark (who rotated turns each turn) &amp; Fuu were in the
undesirable section for those who were having a difficult time playing
the game, and they were all widdled down there after losing a few times
during the day. However, for being in the &#147;loser&#146;s&#148; bracket, they didn&#146;t
mind as long as they were together. That&#146;s all that mattered.

Sakura, however, had found an excuse to sneak out and was upstairs, in
her kitchen, gently working a skillet as she cooked. She felt a little
more at ease when she experimented with cooking, somehow trying to cook
something edible eased the stress off of her (even if she stressed later
when it came time to figure out whether what she made was (in fact)
edible or not). She was doing a simple thing, having taken the spaghetti
from the fridge and tossed it into the pan with the meat sauce to warm 
it up quick on the top of the stove before serving it (something Nina 
taught her). As she checked her progress she felt two arms wrap around 
her waist (without hindering her ability to cook) and that brought a 
smile to her lips.

&#147;Can I have some?&#148;

Sakura suddenly began to sweatdrop--- it WAS Tomoyo behind her (as she
knew), but she wanted to eat her cooking---- Sakura nodded her head
quickly, her hand fumbling abit to shut down the heat before she plated
the food and served it (with nervous hands) to Tomoyo (and herself of
course since she made extra without meaning to, she just threw 
everything in without thinking). &#147;It smells good.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s only reheated food you made.&#148; Sakura lamented, seating herself 
down next to Tomoyo.

&#147;It&#146;s still made with love so let&#146;s eat.&#148;

&#147;---I&#146;ll have some---&#148; Sakura musters, smiling as she digs in and
finds--- it is good. But then again, she thinks to herself, it is
Tomoyo&#146;s cooking after all. She had known abit more about cooking than
Sakura and Sakura thrived to learn as much as she could from her dark
haired lover in the kitchen but never felt confident enough in her 
skills to cook anything complex without her supervising. Still, Tomoyo 
had faith in Sakura&#146;s skills even if Sakura didn&#146;t at times.

As Tomoyo took another mouthful she looked at Sakura with curious eyes.
&#147;Is something wrong?&#148;

&#147;Nothing&#146;s wrong.&#148; she lied, face blushing. However Tomoyo wasn&#146;t going
to be put off so easily, she smiles as she pokes one of Sakura&#146;s cheeks
as she chews on her food. &#147;I know you better than that.&#148;

Sakura swallows hard, fumbling with her fork and words as she tried to
cover up badly. Finally she lowers her head and sighs, &#147;I&#146;m failing some
of my grades.&#148;

&#147;I know.&#148; Tomoyo nods her head, feeling the heat from Sakura&#146;s body as
the other girl blushed red from embarrassment. &#147;But your grades can&#146;t be
the only thing---&#148;

&#147;What kind of father am I going to be if I can&#146;t even be a good role
model in school for---&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; Silence reigns for a few seconds, &#147;I can help you with your
grades---&#148; (stops) &#147;---but Sakura-chan, are you really such a bad
father?&#148;

&#147;---I don&#146;t know---&#148; she admitted truthfully, &#147;I should have talked to
Mirra about Toya instead of brushing it off, I can&#146;t muster the courage
to speak about sex with her and---&#148;

&#147;Well you never been a father before. (Even your own father would never
have thought that one day his precious girl would be somebody&#146;s father).
But don&#145;t worry, I&#145;ll help you.&#148;

&#147;Thanks---&#147; (blushes) &#147;I wouldn&#146;t even know how to begin to explain it 
to papa that---&#147; Sakura sullenly recollects, moping as memories of her
father overwhelm her, &#147;---papa---&#148; Suddenly she fells Tomoyo&#146;s hand 
under her chin as the dark haired girl raises her head to look her 
straight in the eyes, &#147;I envy you. I wish I had a father as loving and 
understanding as yours.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-ch--!&#148; (Tomoyo shushes her) &#147;It&#146;s Ok. I don&#146;t mind talking about
it--- it&#146;s Ok.&#148;

&#147;----tomo-chan---&#148;

The two embrace before going back to eating, Sakura smiling a little if
only to be brave for Tomoyo, as the other watches her with a worried
expression (hidden under a sincere smile).

------

In their bedroom, away from the others (still downstairs partying to
midnight), Sakura clears her throat and looks ahead sternly. 
&#147;Mirra-chan. I want to talk to you today about--- about---&#148;

&#147;Go on, Sakura! You can do it!&#148; Tomoyo cheered her on from the 
sidelines, watching Sakura from a chair set near the bed where she was 
sitting. &#147;I want---&#148; Sakura stammers, blushing, &#147;I WANT TO TALK TO YOU 
ABOUT THE BIRDS AND THE BEES!!&#148;

The stuffed toy Sakura did not react, it simply sat there and stared at
the real Sakura without showing the slightest hint of emotion, 
however--- &#147;Mirra would be freaked by that.&#148;

&#147;You did kind of yell it all of a sudden.&#148; Tomoyo relented, her thoughts
trying to gather, &#147;Maybe you should try another approach?&#148;

Weakly Sakura nodded, and tried again. &#147;Mirra-chan? I want to ask you---
I mean tell you about--- I mean about when two women--- fall in love
and--- I---&#148; (blushes) &#147;---it keeps staring at me.&#148;

&#147;Mirra is going to be just as attentive when you speak to her.&#148;

&#147;But it&#146;s looking at me funny!&#148; Sakura cried, pointing at the toy. &#147;It&#146;s
like I&#146;m talking to little me!&#148;

&#147;I see---&#148; Tomoyo pondered, &#147;Let&#146;s try something else.&#148;

------

&#147;---and I wanted to talk to you today about when two women in love start
to--- feel urges--- I mean when two women fall in love they naturally
feel the urge--- I mean----&#148; Sakura sighs, reaches forward and squeezes
her &#147;audience&#148; (&#147;(laughter)&#148;) &#147;I feel stupid now.&#148;

&#147;Ok.&#148; Tomoyo sighs, &#147;Maybe &#147;Ticklish Hamtaro&#148; wasn&#146;t a good idea for
Mirra&#146;s stand in.&#148;

------

&#147;When two women fall in love one day they feel these urges--- and 
they--- they---&#148; (Sakura sighs again) &#147;---where did you get that 
pillow?&#148;

Tomoyo blinks, then looks at the huge pillow of a naked Anime girl with
an aroused expression. &#147;Umi. She said it looked like Gaia and she
sometimes likes to tease Gaia by---&#148;

&#147;HOEEE!!!&#148; Sakura whines, falling backwards into the bed.

&#147;---sorry----&#148; Tomoyo apologized, quickly removing the pillow from the
room.

------

&#147;When two women fall in love they feel the urge to--- express that love
by--- by making love--- and sometimes that means--- deep full
lovemaking--- and---&#148;

Umi kicks her feet mindlessly listening as she yawns. &#147;Want me to talk
with her? I could make it very easy so even she can understand it.&#147;
(Sakura leans forward interested) &#147;I can just start with telling them
about sex, and then get Mirra into a strap on and pounding into little
Hik---&#148;

Umi lands outside the bedroom door on her rear a few seconds later, with
a sharp &#147;AHH!!!&#148; from Sakura as she slams the door shut behind her. Umi
huffs her breath and goes back downstairs. &#147;She asked.&#148;

------

Sakura stares wide eyed, shocked out of her mind.

&#147;That&#146;s OK.&#148; Tomoyo assures Light/Dark, moving towards them, &#147;I&#146;m sure
Sakura can manage just fine without--- uh--- visual aids--- thank you.&#148;

The two leave before the scene becomes anymore hot, though Sakura ends 
up taking an hour off to &#147;catch her breath&#148; (of which Tomoyo is more 
than glad to &#147;help&#148; her cool down).

------

Sonomi blushes a bright red, and fidgets at the question posed to her.

&#147;---actually, I never really talked to Tomoyo about the birds and
bees---&#148;

&#147;Pwhee!?!&#148;

Tomoyou blushed, &#147;After father raped me and mama found out, she wanted 
to teach me loving proper sex so she showed me the birds and the bees 
first hand and---&#148;

&#147;HOEEE!!!!&#148;

Sakura covered herself with the blankets and refused to come out (no
matter how much Tomoyo prodded the shape beneath the blankets). Sonomi
blushed and excused herself, whispering to Tomoyo as she stood up, 
&#147;Maybe we shouldn&#146;t tell her about &#147;it&#148; either.&#148; Sonomi offers, to which 
Tomoyo nods her head whispering back, &#147;I&#146;m afraid Sakura-chan isn&#146;t 
ready for &#147;it&#147; just yet---&#148;

&#147;HOOOEEEEE!!!!&#148; Sakura screamed, covering her ears--- she apparently
could still hear them.

&#147;---sorry---&#148; Tomoyo offered the shape beneath the blankets that was
Sakura Kinomoto.

-------

&#147;When you two make love for the first time,&#148; Sakura softly whispers,
looking her straight in the eye, &#147;I want it to be as beautiful as when
Tomo-chan and I make love. But you have to be patient. One day, when 
it&#146;s right for both of you, you&#146;ll make love and it&#146;ll be the most 
beautiful thing you ever did---&#148; Sakura sighs, &#147;It didn&#146;t come out 
right!&#148;

Tomoyo nods her head, &#147;It came out fine!&#148;

&#147;I felt like an idiot having to rely on you---&#148;

&#147;You did perfect.&#148; Tomoyo smiles, nodding her head as she did, &#147;I&#146;m 
going to cherish those words when Hikaru and I are ready to make love!&#148;

&#147;Your playing the role to the hilt.&#148; Sakura sighs, &#147;But it&#146;s over now. I
have to---&#148; (stops) &#147;---Tomoyo-chan?&#148;

Tomoyo changes into Mirra. &#147;Thanks, Sakura-pa--- ???&#148;

Sakura, wide eyed and shocked, throws herself back beneath the blankets
crying. Tomoyo comes out, blushing from ear to ear, &#147;----&#148;

&#147;I think I made Sakura-papa cry.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s alright. She&#146;s just cranky because it&#146;s late. Why don&#146;t you
return to the party and we&#146;ll be back shortly---&#148; Tomoyo nudges Mirra
aside and sits down, &#147;Sak---&#148;

&#147;YOU TRICKED ME!!!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148; Tomoyo whispers, crawling on top of Sakura and leaning down
to whisper in her ear, &#147;I wanted you to talk to Mirra and and she 
thought being me would help your nerves---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;M SO EMBARRASSED!!!&#148;

Sakura cried and cried, face buried into her pillow--- until she felt
herself being flipped over onto her back, &#147;!&#148; Tomoyo quickly straddles
Sakura&#146;s belly and holds the other girl down, face stern, &#147;I won&#146;t let
you cry for doing a good deed for our daughter! You&#146;re the best partner 
a woman could want in a lover and the best parent! Please don&#145;t---&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan YOUR HURTING ME!!&#148;

Tomoyo gasps, eyes going wide as she leans back in shock, releasing
Sakura. &#147;Sakura-chan! I&#146;m SORRY! I---&#148; Sakura leaps up, tackling Tomoyo
down hugging her tight, &#147;I just want to be perfect--- like you are---&#148;
she cried, holding Tomoyo tight. &#147;You never fail any tests, you always
know the right things to say, you never wake up late or get embarrassed
about the slightest thing! Your so perfect!!&#148;

&#147;---I&#146;m not perfect---&#148; Tomoyo sighs, holding Sakura close. &#147;I can&#146;t be
perfect without you by my side, because I fall apart if I know your not
near. I can&#146;t be perfect when I depend on you so much that it hurts to
not be near you like this even for a short while. I wish I was perfect,
then I wouldn&#146;t smother you.&#148;

&#147;---you don&#146;t smother me---&#148;

&#147;I only want you to be happy. I don&#145;t want you to feel sad for anything
in the world.&#148;

&#147;---tomo-chan---&#148;

Tomoyo suddenly lightens up, smiling as she encourages Sakura to fondle
her breasts as she pulls her top off, &#147;Your smile is the thing that
brightens my day, even when I&#145;m in a naughty mood.&#148;

Without another word Tomoyo continues to undress Sakura, whose face is
burning red from blushing, &#147;Sorry---&#148; she mustered. &#147;That&#146;s Ok. Now your
going to be a happy gi---&#148; Sakura pulls Tomoyo close and hugs her tight.
Tomoyo&#146;s words fail her as she lies in Sakura&#146;s arms, and sighs in
contentment.

&#147;I&#146;m always happy as long as your with me.&#148;

The two kiss passionately, their clothes falling away as their passions
heat up.

-------

The &#147;skies&#148; above the Tower were clear. The party was now in it&#146;s final
stages.

Everyone was standing around watching the holo clock and preparing to
count down the seconds to midnight. Though it was a well established 
fact that they were, in fact, counting down the time to Midnight in 
Waking Tokyo (in the Waking World of reality) since Time didn&#146;t mean 
much other than something the people of the Realm of Dreams clung onto 
--- a safety blanket of either memories of live in reality or of the 
place which birthed the realm in the first place.

One minute remained.

In Citadel City, the clocks were also counting but for a different
reason---

------

&#147;One minute to Midnight (Tokyo Standard Time).&#148; the computer droned as
everyone watched the screens. The light of the portal was muted by the
harsh blank whiteness of ElseSpace, but the portal was now far larger
than it was days ago when it was first discovered, it was nearly ready.

Everyone watched in anticipation as the seconds ticked down, one after
another, and everyone took a deep breath and watched the monitors.

------

The party became silent as everyone counted down, partners pairing off 
to hold hands.

Sakura/Tomoyo held hands, staring up into the night sky as they waited
for the fireworks.

------

Inside the Pit, Rei reached out and took her partner&#146;s hand, holding it
tight as she leaned towards her to cuddle close. They were scared out of
their mind, not knowing what was going to happen next--- meanwhile, 
miles away, two other lovers held hands and looked forward to what the 
new year would bring. But then again Sakura Kinomoto &amp; Tomoyo Daidouji 
didn&#146;t know what the other two knew--- yet.

The seconds counted down.

Ten--- Umi/Gaia held hands and looked up.

Nine--- the Pit fell silent as everyone watched the monitors.

Eight--- Hikaru rolled herself onto her back, still in Mirra&#146;s grasp, as
they looked up from their resting place on a soft patch of grass under a
holotree (with a clear view of the sky through the branches).

Seven--- Above the planet, on a spacestation in Tokyo, silence reigned 
as the first flight of fighters which would be launched to respond to 
the incoming sphere waited for launch orders.

Six--- Light and Dark embraced Fuu, her smile growing warmer as she gave
herself to her two companions willingly allowing them to slow dance her
about the &#147;roof&#148; of the tower, giggling lightly as they danced into the
new year.

Five--- As he sat on the bridge of his ship he watched the distance 
light that was the dream moon Terra, and waited out near Jupiter orbit 
with a Dominion Republica fleet to respond to the &#147;threat&#148;.

Four--- Sonomi kissed Windy, whispering Nadeshiko&#146;s name---

Three--- Everyone who knew what was coming held their breaths.

Two--- Nadeshiko cried, her new &#147;body&#148; trembling beneath Sonomi&#146;s touch
as she wished she could rush to Sakura and hold her, tell her that she&#145;s
been by her side for months now--- but she promised Sonomi she wouldn&#146;t,
even though she often forgot and came close to telling her &#147;secret&#148;---
Sonomi held her tight as a tear fell down &#147;Windy&#146;s&#148; cheek.

One--- The light of the portal flared---

Then nothing.

Midnight had come and the portal did not let the sphere pass.

Yet.

Above the skies of Tokyo the fireworks began as everyone rang in 2003
with a bang.

However, in Citadel City&#146;s Command Center, the awaited bang turned into 
a soft whisper and nothing--- for now. As the officers scrambled to 
figure out what happened, and monitors checked the readings they 
recalculated the next optimal time for the portal to open wide for the 
sphere to enter through. It was calculated at--- &#147;Ten hours.&#148; Rei 
sighed, leaning back into her chair, &#147;Ten hours.&#148;

Everyone sighed for now, as the burden was temporarily lifted--- but
still, ten more hours.

They began to disperse to grab a bite to eat, call loved ones, etc, but
two people stood behind, and held each other trying to reassure the 
other as the time clicked down again.

Ten hours and counting.

------

Meanwhile, in the Shining Star.

He fell asleep early. He wasn&#146;t a social animal, and didn&#146;t want to 
party even if it was the new year. His dreams of late kept him occupied 
enough. His visions, which were intense and vivid, were his one focal 
point ever since that day when---

Everynight he&#146;d find himself in a strange apartment, in a building high
above Tokyo, feeling depressed angry and alone. Then she&#146;d enter the
room, and it was as if a weight was lifted from his shoulders. As long 
as she was there everything would be alright.

As long as she was there, he was whole again.

He was Syaoran Li, no longer would be Master of the Clow Cards, he wore
new clothes (as a SpellThrasher), and had a new life. He could no longer
bear to wear the clothes of old (the Li Family ceremonial clothes) after
he failed so miserably to become Master of the Clow Cards. He only 
wanted to disappear off the face of the Earth--- but then, one day, he 
woke up (like everyone else) in this place and it was as if they were 
always meant to be there, and lived their lives there.

For some, the change affected them in personal ways and everything
changed.

For Tomoyo it meant she knew her father longer than before, with dire
consequences.

For Syaoran, it meant he saw his mother in a different light.

He could never talk about it, but the first day he awoke in the Realm of
Dreams was truly the first day of his life. His sisters all moved away,
to relish this new world--- but he wanted to change his life, to be more
than he was--- and he found that in the Guardian Academy on the Central
Hub. It changed him, and made him a new man after that. With his new
powers he returned to the Shining Star, and found life had changed while
he was gone. His sisters had all taken husbands, the woman he jilted for
a better life (Meilin) had fallen in love with her mentor and planned to
marry her, and Sakura--- she left him a long time ago (after the passing
to this world) to be with Tomoyo. So, effectively, he had a new life but
was quite alone.

He still had his faithful servant and mentor, but he wanted something
more--- that&#146;s when the dreams started. They were always in the same
place, with the same woman--- someone he couldn&#146;t forget even now as she
held him in her arms. She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen,
and she had surprises which he never thought a woman could have. He 
loved her dearly, and couldn&#146;t wait to meet her in reality so he could
spend every waking moment with her.

After lovemaking they laid in bed together, cuddled close. He sighed,
feeling her soft flowing hair and wishing she was in his arms right now
and not in his dreams. She smiled, and chided him as if she read his
thoughts and whispered that his dreams would be real soon enough and
they&#146;d be together forever.

He nodded his head, feeling the pull of &#147;sleep&#148; drawing him away from 
her once again.

She held him tight, and whispered his name as she sang him to sleep.

She always knew how to make him happy, and nothing in the world would
keep them apart if he had anything to do about it. These dreams were his
guideposts to his own happiness.

The last thing he remembers as he drifts into sleep was her whispering 
his name.

Besides his bed was a picture he drew of her (one of the things he 
learned while at the Academy (for extra credit) was how to be a better 
artist (some spells required an excellent skill in drawing)), her long 
blonde hair rolling down her shoulders and back, and her intoxicating 
smile.

On the picture he wrote two words, which was burned into his mind as 
the name of the person he&#146;d do anything to be with, no matter what.

Two words.
