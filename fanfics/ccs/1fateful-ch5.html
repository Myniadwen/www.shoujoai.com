<a href="../ccs/1fateful-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>THE DECISION. 

The next morning, Sakura woke up in a daze, trying to remember what 
happened the night before. She looked beside her in the bed and saw 
Tomoyo sleeping peacefully. 

After giving her a peck on the cheek, Sakura carefully tried to get out 
of bed. 

&quot;Sakura?&quot; Tomoyo said, still half asleep. 

&quot;Sorry, did I wake you?&quot; 

&quot;Not really...I was starting to wake up anyway.&quot; Replied Tomoyo while 
yawning. 

&quot;I&#39;m going to take a shower... care to join me?&quot; Asked Sakura. 

&quot;Sure.&quot; She said, jumping out of bed. Still naked and sticky from the 
night before. 

Carefully Sakura opened her door and peered around for any sign of Touya 
or her father, whom she knew came home late from a business trip to 
America. 

&quot;Ok, the coast is clear.&quot; She said.  

&quot;Wait. We might need these.&quot; Said Tomoyo picking some clothes from the 
closet for them to wear afterwards. 

&quot;Shoot!&quot; 

&quot;What is it Tomoyo?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t bring a change of underwear with me.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s ok, you can use some of mine until you get home...after all, we 
didn&#39;t exactly plan what happened last night did we?&quot;  

Chuckling, Tomoyo agreed with her and grabbed two pairs of underwear 
from Sakura&#39;s dresser. 

&quot;Ready?&quot; 

&quot;Ready.&quot; 

&quot;Go, go, go!&quot; Said Sakura laughing as the two of them ran butt naked and 
giggling towards the bathroom. 

Tomoyo slammed the door and locked it. 

&quot;Girls? Girls?&quot; 

It was her dad. 

&quot;Yeah Dad?&quot; 

&quot;Ok, it was you.&quot; 

&quot;What was?&quot; 

&quot;I just wondered who slammed the door, that&#39;s all.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry about that!&quot; Yelled Tomoyo. &quot;It was my fault.&quot; 

&quot;Tomoyo? You&#39;re in there too?&quot; 

Giggling she replied: &quot;Yeah, we both needed a shower and we didn&#39;t want 
to waste water.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Ok. Don&#39;t be too long.&quot; 

&quot;No problem.&quot;  

Sakura walked over to the shower and turned it on while Tomoyo sat on 
the counter and waited patiently.  

&quot;You think we should tell our parents about us?&quot; Asked Sakura. 

&quot;Eventually I think we&#39;ll have to.&quot; Said Tomoyo. 

&quot;The waters warm enough now, come on!&quot; Said Sakura, playfully grabbing 
Tomoyo&#39;s hand and leading her into the shower. 

&quot;Wash my back for me would you?&quot; 

&quot;Ok.&quot; Said Sakura. 

After washing Tomoyo&#39;s back, they switched. They made sure to clean 
everything. When they were finished, they hopped out of the shower and 
started drying themselves off. 

&quot;Tomoyo?&quot; 

&quot;What is it Sakura?&quot;  

&quot;Is my butt still red?&quot; 

Laughing, Tomoyo looked closely and replied: &quot;Yes but it&#39;s not swollen 
anymore.&quot; 

&quot;Stupid Touya.&quot; Muttered Sakura. 

&quot;I guess this means you won&#39;t go into his room without his permission 
again huh?&quot; 

&quot;Hey!, you&#39;re supposed to be on my side!&quot; 

&quot;I know. But you&#39;re just so cute when you&#39;re angry!!&quot; 

&quot;I am not!!&quot;  

Jokingly, Tomoyo said that if he caught her in his room again, Sakura 
should ask Touya if Tomoyo could spank her instead. 

At that Sakura said: &quot;I&#39;ll show you!&quot; 

She grabbed the towel and snapped it on Tomoyo&#39;s backside with a nice 
SNAP!! 

&quot;OUCH!!&quot; Yelped Tomoyo. 

Just as she did, Touya walked by the bathroom door and asked if 
everything was alright. 

&quot;We&#39;re fine.&quot; Said Tomoyo. &quot;Sakura just snapped me in the butt with a 
towel. That&#39;s all.&quot; 

Laughing, Touya said for them to hurry and get downstairs or he would 
eat their breakfast. 

&quot;You&#39;d better not!!&quot; They both said. 

After they finished drying themselves off, they put on their underwear 
and started getting dressed. 

&quot;Sakura?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah?&quot; 

&quot;Can you help me with this thing? It&#39;s a bit big for me.&quot; 

She was referring to Sakura&#39;s bra. Sakura&#39;s breasts were growing a bit 
faster than Tomoyo&#39;s, so her bra needed to be adjusted to fit her 
properly. 

After getting dressed, they headed downstairs for breakfast. Just as 
they rounded the corner of the Kitchen, Sakura caught Touya trying to 
steal their food. 

&quot;Touya!!&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Asked Sakura&#39;s dad. 

&quot;Touya... eat your own breakfast.&quot; 

&quot;Hey Monster.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t call me that!!&quot; 

&quot;Morning Monster.&quot;  

&quot;DAD!!&quot; 

&quot;Touya, stop teasing them and eat your food.&quot; 

&quot;Well... how was your night girls?&quot; 

&quot;Ummm, pretty good.&quot; Said Tomoyo. 

&quot;Sakura?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, it was good.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear it.&quot; 

As they ate breakfast, Sakura and Tomoyo couldn&#39;t stop looking at each 
other. Touya picked up on this and said that it looked like they were in 
love with each other. 

After looking at each other, Tomoyo and Sakura both stuck their tongues 
out him. 

&quot;Stop it you three.&quot; Ordered Sakura&#39;s dad. 

&quot;Did you want me to give you a ride home Tomoyo?&quot; 

&quot;No, it&#39;s ok. I think I&#39;ll walk.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m going to walk Tomoyo home later. Is that ok dad?&quot; 

&quot;Sure.&quot; 

After breakfast, Sakura and Tomoyo headed back upstairs to collect 
Tomoyo&#39;s backpack and her clothes from the night before. 

&quot;Do you have everything?&quot; 

&quot;I think so.&quot; Said Tomoyo. 

&quot;Ok then. Let&#39;s get going.&quot; 

On their way to Tomoyo&#39;s house, they started talking. 

&quot;Listen... I think that we should tell my mother about us.&quot; Said Tomoyo. 

&quot;Me too.&quot; Replied Sakura. &quot;I think she&#39;ll understand it a lot more than 
my dad would right now.&quot; </pre>
