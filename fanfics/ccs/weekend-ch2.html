<h1>A Weekend in the Sky (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fiala.html">John Fiala</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/weekend-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>	Tomoyo was tempted awake by the smell of bacon frying.  Eyes open,
she tried to remember who could possibly be cooking for her, but it came
back in a rush when Sakura walked in, holding a bed tray piled with
breakfast.

	&quot;Good morning, sleepyhead!&quot;  Sakura was dressed in an old Tokyo
Giants T-Shirt that she must have found in Tomoyo&#39;s dresser, and a pair of
freyed jeans that Sumire must have left behind.  Tomoyo suppressed a brief
spike of pain at the thought, and then sat up in bed to eat.  Sakura
joined her on the bed, and they shared the plate of bacon, scrambled eggs,
and toast.

	&quot;Mmmm.  That was pretty good, Sakura.  When did you learn to cook
American food?&quot;

	Sakura laughed.  &quot;College.  After a few years I had to wake myself
up, feed myself, and get to morning classes on time.  And Dad wasn&#39;t able
to give me enough money to eat breakfast from restaurants every morning.&quot;

	&quot;Weren&#39;t you able to eat in the dorms?&quot;

	&quot;Well, yes, but I wasn&#39;t supposed to have guys in the dorm, and
after they caught me with Syaoran for the fourth time,&quot; Sakura&#39;s voice
trailed off.

	&quot;Sorry.&quot;

	Sakura shook her head.  &quot;No, it&#39;s okay.  It&#39;s not *your* fault.&quot;  
She busied herself with picking up the breakfast dishes, and took the mess
back to the kitchen, letting Tomoyo get out of bed and ready for the day.



	Tomoyo later stepped out of her bedroom, still busy brushing her
long black hair.  She caught Sakura looking at her photographs.

	Sakura looked up.  &quot;Hey, your mom&#39;s still looking pretty good!&quot;

	&quot;Oh, yes.  She&#39;s still living at the old place.&quot;

	&quot;Who&#39;s this with you?&quot;  Sakura held up a larger picture.

	Tomoyo didn&#39;t have to look long.  &quot;Oh,&quot; she sighed, &quot;that&#39;s
Sumire.  She used to live here with me.&quot;

	Sakura blushed slightly, and looked at the picture.  Sumire was
tall, with dirty brown hair, a cute but pugnacious face, and was wearing a
pair of muddy overalls over a violet shirt.  She was leaning against an
equally muddy motorbike, and had a friendly arm wrapped around Tomoyo, who
didn&#39;t look like she minded the mud on her clothes.  &quot;Where is she?&quot;

	Tomoyo sat on the couch, wishing briefly that it would swallow her
up.  &quot;She... she&#39;s been in the middle of moving out for a few weeks.  
Yesterday, she finished.&quot;

	Sakura saw Tomoyo&#39;s face, and put the picture back hastily.  &quot;Oh
god, Tomoyo, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  She ran over and gave Tomoyo a tight hug,
burying her face into the girl&#39;s neck.  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;

	Tomoyo drew in a ragged breath, and then let it out.  &quot;It&#39;s okay.  
She was with me for eight months, almost.&quot;

	&quot;What happened?&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Tomoyo lied.  Sumire had told her flat out that
she was tired of waiting for Tomoyo to stop dividing her love between her
and Sakura, but she didn&#39;t want to say that.  &quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot;

	She wasn&#39;t, but Sakura held her until she was better.



	&quot;All right,&quot; said Sakura, &quot;this is getting entirely too morose.  
We&#39;ve got to go and get our minds off of this.  What do you think?&quot;

	Tomoyo nodded, and thought about it.  &quot;How about we go out for a
walk?&quot;

	&quot;In this weather?&quot;  Sakura pointed out the window.  Although the
snow had stopped falling, the skies were still dark and snow coated the
sidewalks.

	&quot;I was thinking the National Conservitory.  I&#39;m a member in good
standing, and we&#39;ll have the place pretty much to ourselves this early in
the morning.&quot;

	Sakura grinned, and grabbed her coat.



	&quot;You weren&#39;t kidding about being in good standing!&quot; exclaimed
Sakura as the two of them walked through the Orchid Room.  The
Conservitory wouldn&#39;t actually open for a few more hours, and from time to
time they encountered people working on the plants.

	&quot;Well, my mother keeps giving them a healthy donation every year.  
She loves this place, both personally and for business meetings.&quot;  Tomoyo
took a moment to smell the flower she was passing, and then continued,
&quot;and I plan to follow her example.&quot;  They walked along for a few moments.  
&quot;So, what have you been up to?&quot;

	Sakura nodded.  &quot;Well, after college Syaoran and myself started
traveling through Hong Kong and China, with his skills and my magic.  We
had a number of adventures, until we started to notice the magic fading.  
After that we had to return to Japan and get real jobs.&quot;

	&quot;Must have reassured your father.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.  Sakura turned backwards to face Tomoyo, walking backwards.  
&quot;Syaoran got a good job at Sony, based on his ability with languages.  I
started to get into modeling, with a hand from my brother.&quot;

	Tomoyo had seen Touya&#39;s pictures in various advertisements for
years.  &quot;And then into the photography end of the business?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.  I was getting a bit old for modeling after a few years,
and the pay is a lot more dependable.&quot;  She smiled.  &quot;I just remembered
everything you did back in high school, and I was fine.  Even then, you
were helping me out.&quot;

	&quot;So, does it pay well?  I thought of running off and doing that
for a living a few times back when I was in school.&quot;

	&quot;Pretty good.  Quite often I bring home more than Syaoran.&quot;

	Silence grew after the absent member of the trio was spoken, as if
he had somehow stepped onto the path with them.  The two of them continued
along silently.

	Sakura grew embarassed, and tried to think of a new topic, any new
topic.  &quot;So, why did you leave us?&quot;  She winced, hearing the words escape
her mouth.  Smooth, she chided herself.

	&quot;Do you remember the graduation party?&quot;  Tomoyo&#39;s voice was even,
as if she was talking about the price of a trinket.

	Sakura nodded, blushing.  &quot;Uh, yeah.&quot;

	&quot;After that party, things went back to normal.  It was you and
Syaoran together, and me following behind.&quot;

	&quot;But, I didn&#39;t want to shut you out!&quot;  Sakura&#39;s eyes glimmered
with unshed tears.

	&quot;It&#39;s okay, Sakura.  I wanted the two of you together.  I&#39;d hoped
you would find someone.  But, I&#39;d been in love with you for years.&quot;

	&quot;I know.  I never knew what to do.&quot;

	Tomoyo nodded, trying to reassure her friend.  &quot;After having had
you, though, I wasn&#39;t able to just sit there and watch you two together.  
It was too much.  So, I switched schools, and tried to forget you.&quot;  
Unsuccessfully, she didn&#39;t add.  Sakura had had a presence in her life
even after Tomoyo had tried to leave her behind.

	Tomoyo stopped, and remembered Sumire from two weeks ago, the girl
pleading with her to drop this obsession with Sakura, although Sumire
hadn&#39;t known the girl&#39;s name.  Sumire had only known that there was
something that Tomoyo was keeping between them.  She had demanded that
Tomoyo choose between her and Sakura, and when Tomoyo had not been able
to, had left.

	She looked up, and saw Sakura looking at her.  Was Sakura really
willing to live with Tomoyo like this?  Or was it just a retreat that
would end with Tomoyo being left behind again?

	Or was the question this: Should Tomoyo try to take Sakura away
from a husband that at one time had dearly loved her, or should she mend
what she once helped build?

	&quot;Are you okay, Tomoyo?&quot;  Sakura looked a little worried.

	Tomoyo nodded, and flashed a smile.  &quot;Yeah.  Just my mind
wandering.&quot;  A pause.  &quot;Sakura?&quot;

	&quot;Mmmm?&quot;

	&quot;Do you have any kids?&quot;

	Sakura shook her head.  &quot;No.  We&#39;ve tried,&quot; and here a blush again
crept across her face, &quot;but Syaoran has a low sperm count.&quot;  The blush
intensified, and Tomoyo could feel her own cheeks reddening.  &quot;I guess
that&#39;s a good thing, now.&quot;

	Tomoyo bit her lip.  Was it?



	For lunch, they picked up some Chinese takeout, and took it back
to Tomoyo&#39;s apartment.  As she drove, Tomoyo kept one eye on the
sidewalks, looking for a particular face.

	A rush of warmth flooded her when she saw it.  &#39;Good boy,&#39; she
thought to herself as she saw Syaoran trudging along the sidewalk, huddled
in the warmth of his jacket as he searched the face of each person he
passed.  &#39;You&#39;ve come looking for her.&#39;

	They stepped into her apartment, and soon had the chicken lo mein
and pork dumplings spread out.  Tomoyo waited until the meal was over.

	&quot;Sakura, you and Syaoran belong together.  I saw that back when
you two first became close.  He used to make you happy, and vice versa.&quot;

	Sakura frowned.  &quot;If he wanted to make me happy, he wouldn&#39;t have
started an affair with that... artificial bitch!&quot;

	The slur echoed somewhat in the empty apartment.

	Tomoyo took a deep breath.  &quot;I know.  But, he was threatened, I
think.&quot;

	&quot;Threatened?&quot;  Sakura&#39;s voice was doubtful, almost scornful.

	&quot;First, he loses his magic, that his family has stressed the
importance of since he was two.  Then he&#39;s not even as good at supporting
a family as you are.  And on top of that, he&#39;s not even as.. potent as he
should be.  Every step of the way, his masculinity is eroded...&quot;

	Sakura&#39;s eyes widened for a moment.  &quot;But it&#39;s still his damn
fault!&quot; she responded, her voice thick with anger.

	Tomoyo nodded.  &quot;Yes, I know.  But you&#39;ve got to understand what
he&#39;s feeling.  He&#39;s not sleeping with his secretary because he doesn&#39;t
love you.  He&#39;s doing it because with her he is undisputedly in charge, in
control.&quot;  She took her friend&#39;s hand in hers.  &quot;I&#39;m sure he still loves
you deeply.&quot;

	Sakura sighed, torn.  &quot;If he does, then where is he?&quot;

	The silence after her question was broken by the buzzing of the
security system.  Tomoyo gave her friend&#39;s hand a squeeze, and ran off to
the door, flipping a switch to bring up the vistor&#39;s face, without
revealing her own.

	Syaoran stood there, nervously looking around and twisting one
foot back and forth.  Tomoyo let loose a breath that she hadn&#39;t known she
was holding in.  &quot;He&#39;s here.&quot;

	Sakura ran over, and looked.  &quot;He&#39;s...&quot;  Her voice trailed off.  
&quot;I don&#39;t know what to do.  I&#39;m still angry at him, but I...&quot;  She looked
at Tomoyo.  &quot;And I don&#39;t want to lose you again!&quot;

	Tomoyo smiled.  &quot;You won&#39;t be.  But we need to get you both
together again.&quot;  She reached for the comm switched, and pressed it.  
&quot;Hello, Syaoran.&quot;  She let her voice be faintly rebuking in tone.

	The man jumped, and spun to face the screen.  &quot;Ah, Tomoyo!  Is
Sakura here?&quot;

	&quot;She is.&quot;

	&quot;I, I need to see her.  I need to apologize.  I&#39;m an idiot...&quot;

	Tomoyo cut him off.  &quot;Come on up, then.  Top floor.&quot;  She pressed
the door release button.

	Syaoran jumped at the sound of the door&#39;s buzzer, and jerked it
open and ran through, quickly leaving the camera&#39;s field of vision.  
Tomoyo turned off the console, and turned to see Sakura looking
apprehensive.

	&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t know what to do!&quot;

	Tomoyo walked over and gave Sakura a quick hug.  &quot;What do you want
to do?&quot;

	&quot;Hit him!&quot;

	Tomoyo took a step back and looked at her seriously.  &quot;Really?&quot;

	&quot;Well, no.&quot;  Sakura sighed, and then went rigid when a knock came
on the door.  &quot;WhatDoIDo?&quot;

	Tomoyo shook her head.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you go wait in another room
until you&#39;re ready?&quot;

	Sakura disappeared into Tomoyo&#39;s bedroom, slamming the door behind
her.  But Tomoyo noticed the door swinging slightly open as she walked to
let Syaoran in.
	


	Tomoyo opened the door, and smiled at Syaoran.  &quot;Good evening.&quot;

	He looked about.  &quot;Is the entire floor yours?&quot;

	Tomoyo stepped back, holding the door open.  &quot;Come on in.  Yes,
it&#39;s all mine.&quot;

	Syaoran stepped in, and looked around.  &quot;Where&#39;s Sakura?&quot;

	&quot;She&#39;s waiting.  I want to talk to you first.  Would you like
something to drink?&quot;

	&quot;A beer?&quot;  Syaoran wilted somewhat, and went to sit on the couch.

	Tomoyo nodded, and went to the kitchen.  Returning with a beer and
a glass of water, she set them down on her glass coffee table and sat in a
chair facing Syaoran.

	For a moment, they just sat there: Tomoyo getting her thoughts in
order, and Syaoran dreading what would come next.

	&quot;Do you love her?&quot;

	Tomoyo&#39;s voice was so faint, that at first Syaoran wasn&#39;t sure he
hadn&#39;t imagined it.  &quot;Yes!&quot;

	&quot;Then why?&quot;

	Syaoran flinched at Tomoyo&#39;s raised voice.  &quot;I dunno.&quot;  He looked
up from the floor and saw Tomoyo glaring at him, sweet Tomoyo who never
hurt a fly, and felt fear creeping up his spine.

	&quot;Do not give me &#39;I dunno&#39;,&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s voice mocked his reply,
&quot;Syaoran.  I want answers.&quot;

	A few more seconds of Tomoyo&#39;s piercing glare, and his eyes slid
back to the floor.  &quot;I&#39;m not a man anymore.&quot;  A glance upwards showed that
Tomoyo was expecting slightly more.  &quot;I used to be one.  But now Sakura
earns more money than I could hope to bring in, I don&#39;t have any magic
anymore, I can&#39;t even give her a son... what good am I?  I wanted to feel
like I was important again.&quot;

	&quot;And your secretary does that?&quot;

	Syaoran felt his skin flush.  &quot;She has to do what I tell her.  I
didn&#39;t want to hurt anyone...&quot;

	Tomoyo sighed.  Syaoran would have to be shown that his secretary,
as artificial as she was, was actually a person - but that would have to
wait until later.  &quot;Why didn&#39;t you just tell Sakura?&quot;

	Syaoran&#39;s eyes widened.  &quot;Tell her I was having sex with my
secretary?&quot;

	Tomoyo felt a momentary urge to throw her glass at his head.  
&quot;No.  About how you felt.  About what you needed.&quot;

	Syaoran looked at the floor again.  &quot;I... I couldn&#39;t.&quot;

	&quot;Not manly enough?&quot;

	Syaoran&#39;s eyes met Tomoyo&#39;s in anger, and then in resignation.  
&quot;Yeah.&quot;  His voice was so soft that Tomoyo was afraid it hadn&#39;t reached
the bedroom, but when she saw the door slowly opening further she knew it
had.

	&quot;She still loves you, Syaoran.  But you&#39;re really going to have to
change some things if you want your marriage to work.&quot;  Tomoyo saw Sakura
step out, and nod to her.  &quot;Are you willing to do that?&quot;

	Syaoran nodded enthusiastically.  &quot;Yes, oh god yes!&quot;

	Tomoyo smiled, and pointed over his shoulder.  &quot;Sakura&#39;s here.&quot;

	Syaoran turned, freezing for just a second as he saw his wife
standing across the room from him.  He scrambled across the couch and ran
to her, at the last minute dropping to his knees and hugging her around
the legs.  &quot;Oh god, Darling, I&#39;m so sorry.  So sorry... please forgive me.  
I love you.&quot;  He felt Sakura&#39;s hand on his head, and looked up, tears
blurring his view.

	&quot;I love you too.  I&#39;m still pretty mad, Li Syaoran, but I love
you.&quot;  Sakura pulled her husband onto his feet, and hugged him close.

	Tomoyo walked up to them, and put a hand on their shoulders.  
&quot;You two have a lot to talk about.  Why don&#39;t you stay here?  There&#39;s food
in the fridge, and by the phone there&#39;s a number of take out places that
I&#39;ve got an account with.&quot;

	Sakura blinked.  &quot;But what about you?&quot;

	Tomoyo grinned.  &quot;I&#39;ve got someplace else I need to go.&quot;  She left
them there, and packed a small suitcase.  Coming back into the foyer, she
found them still embracing, and the three shared a blush as the couple
broke off a kiss.  &quot;Listen to me, both of you.  Anything worth having
requires work to get it, and relationships aren&#39;t any different from
anything else.  Work at this, for me if not for each other, okay?&quot;

	&quot;Tomoyo,&quot; Sakura whispered, her eyes tearing.

	&quot;Don&#39;t cry for me, Sakura.  I&#39;ll be fine, now.&quot;  Tomoyo kissed her
forehead, dropped the extra pair of keys into Syaoran&#39;s hand, and walked
out the door.



	Sumire walked down the hallway to her apartment, the sight of the
corridor still new enough to her to draw her attention.  Her back hurt,
her legs hurt, and her feet hurt: the Tokyo to Los Angeles flight was
always a lot of work, and she was glad to get back home.  She hoped
despirately that she&#39;d had the forethought to unpack the footmassager that
Tomoyo had given her already, because she needed it.

	Which is why she didn&#39;t notice it until she arrived at her door.  
There was a single red rose taped to her door, with no note attatched.  
She searched the floor briefly, but it didn&#39;t seem to have fallen off, so
she shrugged, took the rose, and then unlocked and opened her door.

	With a flick of the switch, lights sprung on in her apartment&#39;s
brief hallway, and she gasped softly.  Every horizontal surface above the
floor in her apartment seemed to be covered with vases of roses, dozens
upon dozens of them crowding the walls.  The fragrance of the flowers was
strong, and then she realized that there was a thick carpet of rosepetals
leading from her door to her bedroom.

	She slipped off her shoes and stepped on the rose petals, feeling
the softness caress her aching feet.  The door shut behind her, she
silently went to her bedroom door, pushing it open.

	She did not need to turn on any lights here.  Her bedroom shared
the rose bouquets with space cleared for nearly two dozen candles, each of
them burning and shining light on her small bed.  On the bed lay her
ex-girlfriend Tomoyo, nude except for a layer of rose petals providing a
scant cover.  &quot;Tomoyo?&quot;

	The woman&#39;s eyes opened, although Sumire was sure that she had
heard when the door had opened.

	&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I treated your horribly because I was still
infatuated with someone else, and I deserved you walking out on me like
that.  But I want to try again, if you&#39;ll have me.&quot;

	Sumire&#39;s eyes narrowed.  &quot;And how do I know that you won&#39;t be
mooning after that.. that...&quot;

	&quot;Sakura,&quot; Tomoyo volenteered.

	&quot;That Sakura?&quot;

	Tomoyo nodded.  &quot;While you were gone, she came to see me.  And
while she was there with me, all I could think of... was you.&quot;

	Sumire felt herself smile.

	&quot;And since I&#39;ve given her and her husband use of my house, I had
to come here, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

	Sumire sat down next to Tomoyo.  &quot;Thank you for the roses.&quot;

	&quot;Well?&quot;

	&quot;All right.  I&#39;ll give you another chance.&quot;

	Tomoyo gave a cry of joy, wrapped her arms around Sumire, and
kissed her.  And soon there were many cries of joy, and of love.

	Sakura and Syaoran did indeed heal their marriage, although she
did make sure that all of his future bioroid secretaries were male.  
Tomoyo and Sumire were wed a year later in a small private ceremony
attended by her aged mother, Sakura, Syaoran, and Sumire&#39;s older brother.  
And they all lived very happily, although Sumire kept making fun of
Tomoyo&#39;s habit of taping her all of the time, to which Tomoyo only said &quot;I
have a lot of tapes that now need to be filled with you.&quot;
