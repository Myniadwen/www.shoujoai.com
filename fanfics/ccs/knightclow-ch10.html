<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 10 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>The white haired young man returned to the museum,
dropping down to the roof of the building on wings of
silver-white. Robes that had once been tattered were
pristine, now, and his eyes had lost the wild look
they had once had.

&quot;Ho, Yue,&quot; the voice rumbled as the great cat stepped
from the shadows.

&quot;Keroberos,&quot; Yue nodded regally to the golden lion as
he reported, &quot;the Fight card has been defeated, just
as we expected.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t start celebrating yet,&quot; Keroberos cautioned him
gruffly, &quot;there are still many more cards for her to
catch, not to mention....&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Yue nodded, &quot;but at least we are finally
regaining our strength of old, with each card that she
captures and returns to the book.&quot;

&quot;I just wish that she could find them quicker,&quot;
Keroberos rumbled deep in his throat, &quot;I think she
relies on as much luck as skill.&quot;

&quot;What are you suggesting?&quot; Yue recognized that tone of
voice.

Keroberos shrugged, &quot;Just that she might need a guide
of some sort....&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t,&quot; Yue shook his head, &quot;our Master would not
be pleased in our interfering so blatantly in the
Knight&#39;s path.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Keroberos sounded amused as he
said, &quot;I remember the Master himself bending the rules
on occasion.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Yue nodded. He looked over at the lion
thoughtfully a moment, &quot;So what, exactly, were you
planning?&quot;

Keroberos just smiled a toothy grin.

The morning sun gave Tomoyo a headache as she rushed
into the newspaper offices, carrying the computer
disks containing her story and Yukito&#39;s photos. &quot;Hey
Tomoyo,&quot; Rika looked cheerful as the brown haired girl
walked by, &quot;the boss wants to see you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Tomoyo nodded as the black haired woman
detoured towards the office.

Yukito looked over at her, his blonde hair falling
into those gentle eyes. &quot;You want me along?&quot; he asked
her curiously.

&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Knight related,&quot; Tomoyo smiled
slightly as she admitted, &quot;I think another story I
wrote just went off.&quot;

&quot;Well, good luck,&quot; Yukito waved before taking the
photo disk and heading off to upload the latest set of
Knight images.

Tomoyo slowed as she neared the office, feeling a
flash of irritation as she met the secretary&#39;s
twinkling eyes. Mei-Lin smiled, her black hair in twin
ponytails as she efficiently dealt with a caller.
Putting the phone down she said, &quot;Looks like the Chief
is annoyed with you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; Tomoyo answered dryly,
&quot;considering I helped break a negative story about one
of our best advertisers.&quot; Privately she added, &#39;Not to
mention my mother&#39;s company.&#39;

&quot;Go on in,&quot; Mei-Lin said before adding with a
sympathetic smile, &quot;and you&#39;d better be wearing your
flack jacket.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Tomoyo had to smile back as she went inside.

Kaho Mitsuki looked up as Tomoyo came in, her eyes
flashing angrily as the brown haired woman tossed
yesterday&#39;s paper down on the desk. &quot;Care to explain?&quot;
she demanded.

The headline read, &quot;Fraud at highest levels of
Daidouji Manufacturing&#39; and just below it in large
text was, &#39;Top executives implicated!&#39; The paragraphs
below spelled out what Tomoyo and several other
investigative reporters had pieced together, along
with police statements and other information.

&quot;I thought it was pretty clear, actually,&quot; Tomoyo
answered mildly.

&quot;I have just spent the whole morning having my ear
chewed off,&quot; Kaho scowled, &quot;not to mention getting
complaints from several of our other advertisers.&quot;

&quot;If my mother has been one of the ones chewing,&quot;
Tomoyo said harshly, &quot;then maybe she should be
spending more time cleaning her own house.&quot;

Kaho smiled wryly, &quot;Actually, she was one of the few
that wasn&#39;t.&quot;

Tomoyo gave a little smile, &quot;I didn&#39;t think so.&quot;
Seriously she said, &quot;I am not going to edit my stories
to keep our advertisers happy, ma&#39;am. I&#39;d sooner
quit.&quot;

&quot;And I wouldn&#39;t ask you to,&quot; Kaho replied. She slapped
her hand down on the paper again loudly, startling the
younger woman as she growled out, &quot;But next time warn
me when you&#39;re doing something this big!&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Tomoyo said sheepishly.

Kaho sat back with a sigh, rubbing the bridge of her
nose as if she had a headache. &quot;Anything new on the
Knight story?&quot; she asked.

&quot;More footage of her in action,&quot; Tomoyo answered
promptly, &quot;but I&#39;m sorry to say we don&#39;t have anything
else on her.&quot;

With a thoughtful look Kaho commented, &quot;Why do I get
the feeling you know more about this than you&#39;re
telling?&quot;

&quot;Have to protect my sources, ma&#39;am,&quot; Tomoyo answered
crisply. &#39;I wonder what she&#39;d say if I told her my
source is the Knight herself?&#39; she thought.

&quot;All right,&quot; Kaho conceded. She looked at Tomoyo a few
moments longer, almost as if she wanted to say
something else, then simply said, &quot;You&#39;d better get
back to work.&quot;

Kaho waited a few moments then picked up her phone,
dialing a familiar number. &quot;Hello?&quot; Sonomi Daidouji
asked crisply.

&quot;It&#39;s Kaho,&quot; she answered, &quot;I just got done talking to
your wayward daughter.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I should be proud or furious over
what she&#39;s done,&quot; Sonomi sounded frustrated. &quot;Why
didn&#39;t she come to me with the information,&quot; she
growled, &quot;instead of going to the papers with it?&quot;

&quot;She is a reporter,&quot; Kaho answered mildly.

&quot;You know something?&quot; Sonomi asked, picking up
something in Kaho&#39;s tone of voice.

&quot;Just that she didn&#39;t seem terribly happy with you
when we were talking,&quot; Kaho related. She paused a
moment, &quot;Is there more to this estrangement between
you two than you&#39;ve told me?&quot;

Sonomi sounded pained, &quot;There is a great deal of bad
blood between us, more than I can go into in a few
minutes.&quot; She sighed, &quot;We can talk about it when you
come over tonight.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m coming over?&quot; Kaho asked with a slight smile.

&quot;I hope you will,&quot; Sonomi said warmly, &quot;I&#39;m planning
to have my cook make us something then I&#39;m going to
give her and the maid staff the night off.&quot;

&quot;Planning something interesting?&quot; Kaho felt herself
beginning to smile.

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Sonomi purred.

&quot;Then how can I say no?&quot; Kaho laughed. More seriously
she continued, &quot;And maybe we can talk about you and
Tomoyo a bit, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Sonomi agreed.

They talked a little while longer then disconnected,
each returning to their work. Kaho studied the paper a
moment, her thoughts turning to one of her best
reporters. &quot;Tomoyo knows more about the Knight than
she&#39;s telling,&#39; she mused, &#39;but what?&#39;

The first possibility that came to mind was that
Tomoyo was the Knight herself, and it wasn&#39;t one that
Kaho dismissed out of hand. Writing about your own
escapades wasn&#39;t that hard, and she knew Yukito was
good enough of a friend to help her pull it off....

&quot;Nah,&quot; Kaho chuckled to herself as she picked up
another call.</pre>
