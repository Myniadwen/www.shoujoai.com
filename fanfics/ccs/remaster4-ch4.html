<h1>Remastered IV (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster4-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>January was rolling along.

The threat of CLAMP School still loomed high in the sky over 
everybody.

It was slowly becoming a topic of discussion and debate as it lingered 
longer and longer, seemingly not moving an inch and yet not going 
anywhere either. People were becoming concerned.

It was that lingering &#147;threat&#148; which prompted the Council to request a 
speeding up of the process to capture Clow Cards, which only seemed to 
make Nina sneer at the thought.

It was hard enough to track down and locate each card, especially 
since there&#146;d been a recent slump in card appearances as of late, but 
to pick up the pace? It seemed an unreasonable request yet there it 
was.

&#147;How am I going to carry this out?&#148; she griped, looking over the 
letter again as she laid in bed. The &#147;letter&#148; was a copy of a 
communique she received yesterday, yet it troubled her even now.

There just didn&#146;t seem to be an answer to the problem of increasing 
the pace to search for Clow Cards. Sakura could do more &#147;patrols&#148;, but 
they seemed to have learned their lesson the second time around and 
were finding new and inventive ways to &#147;lie low&#148; and stay in hiding.

Clearly new tricks had to be used to flush them out, but what?

A few gentle fingers brushed through her green hair, bringing Nina&#146;s 
attention up towards Eliza who sat on the edge of the bed smiling at 
her. &#147;Trouble?&#148; Eliza asked, to which Nina replied &#147;Nothing you can&#146;t 
chase away.&#148; drawing her tall Amazonian love close to kiss her, 
letting the paper fall to one side as they cuddled.

-----

It was a weekend, so Sakura didn&#146;t wake up early for school.

Yet, if Nina was the one being asked, she would complain that Sakura 
didn&#146;t wake up early for anything (even her own funeral). Tomoyo, 
however, kept to her usual schedule. She woke up the same time every 
morning regardless of whether it was school or not, though 
occasionally she lingered in bed if only to relish and treasure the 
soft glow of sleeping in Sakura&#146;s loving embrace just for a little bit 
longer. As she woke this morning she brushed a few fingers across 
Sakura&#146;s sleeping face, feeling quite warm just looking at her.

Carefully her fingers loosened the sheet around one arm so she could 
look at it. The arm didn&#146;t bear any marks from when she gripped Sakura 
too hard a few weeks ago, but the thought still lingered.

She didn&#146;t know why but that moment she -- at that moment she stopped 
and chided herself. She was thinking to hard about it.

Slowly she dressed and snuck out to make breakfast, leaving Sakura 
behind.

Ten minutes later the door opened and someone else entered.

She was not tall, nor was she terribly short, but she did seem to 
stand out from her appearance.

She had short red hair, a mischievous look on her face, and wore a 
strange mis-mash of an Alliance uniform jacket, a t-shirt with a face 
sticking it&#146;s tongue out at the viewer, shorts, high top sneakers, arm 
and leg pads and three pairs of gloves which hung off a belt on her 
waist ranging from tough work gloves to soft petite gloves. She also 
wore a backpack slung on her back which made a soft beeping noise 
every so often.

If one had to decide the person she resembled in passing, it would be 
Radical Ed (Cowboy Bebop), but the appearance was altered making her 
her own individual and not a clone, though in a sense cloning was 
involved in her &#147;Creation&#148;.

She stopped, tilted her head slightly upon looking at Sakura, and 
blinked a few times.

Then she jumped onto the bed hard, bringing Sakura up from her sleep 
in a panicked shrieking yelp, screaming &#147;ME-ME!!&#148;

Sakura wouldn&#146;t stop screaming, or trying to get away from the now 
grabby and huggy girl until Tomoyo came to cuddle and comfort her now 
stressed out lover. Sakura&#146;s screams could be heard all the way from 
the upstairs kitchen so Tomoyo quickly abandoned the room and came 
running to her aid.

Leaving one rather frustrated Umi with breakfast to make.

Gaia couldn&#146;t believe her eyes when she saw the former Clow Card 
making breakfast, to which she was promptly scowled at by the stove 
burdened girl who growled, &#147;Well? Don&#146;t just stand there! Plates!!&#148;

-----

The first thing Nina did when she entered the upstairs kitchen was 
sigh miserably.

&#147;Where is she?&#148;

&#147;Where&#146;s who?&#148; Umi grumbled, looking over at their new &#147;guest&#148;.

The strange girl at the table looked over at Nina and smiled, pointing 
a finger at her and going &#147;Nena!&#148;

&#147;Nina, not &#147;Nena&#147; you social retard.&#148; she growled, looking at the girl 
severely. Sakura (still being comforted) was being watched over by 
Tomoyo as she fed the mistress of the cards her breakfast. &#147;It&#146;s Nina. 
Can&#146;t you get that through your---&#148;

&#147;Miyu-chan says HI!!&#148;

Nina falls into one of the chairs and grabs some food, &#147;So where is 
the furball anyway? Sleeping? Eating the plants? Making mad love to 
the first unconscious girl she could subdue on the street? What?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s putting in the Nasty Clow Card Tracking Gizmo Device thing you 
ordered!&#148; (makes a weird face) &#147;Track those nasty Card things and 
wham! Bam!&#148; (smiles) &#147;That&#146;ll be 59,350 credits please, no IOUs.&#148;

&#147;---whatever---&#148; Nina sighed.

Since Sakura was staring at her with anxious eyes, and Tomoyo seemed 
interested in hearing an explanation as well, Nina bit the bullet and 
started. &#147;Sakura---?&#148;

&#147;HAI!&#148; (the strange girl shot her arm up)

&#147;Wait a second--- Sakura---&#148;

&#147;HAI!&#148; (again, the strange girl shot her arm up)

&#147;---sigh--- this---&#148; (Nina points at girl) &#147;---is Sakura---&#148; (pauses) 
&#147;---don&#146;t you want to say something?&#148;

She thinks about it for awhile, before asking Tomoyo for the syrup.

Nina - &#147;---Sakura here---&#148;

&#147;HAI!&#148;

&#147;WOULD YOU STOP THAT ALREADY!!&#148; (snarls) &#147;SAKURA HERE IS A WHACKED OUT 
SEX DROID OUR CHIEF ENGINEER OWNS! SHE&#146;S A PAIN UP THE ASS AND ABOUT 
AS MUCH FUN AS A STRAP ON THAT&#146;S WAY TOO THICK, WHICH IS IRONIC 
BECAUSE SHE&#146;S WAY TOO &#147;THICK&#148; FOR HER OWN GOOD!!&#148; (Nina stops and 
pants to catch her breath) &#147;---there---&#148;

Sakura, the other Sakura, sits at her chair eating mindlessly not 
paying Nina one bit of attention. Finally giving up, Nina ignores her 
and eats as Eliza walks into the kitchen. The minute the taller 
woman&#146;s eyes falls on &#147;Sakura&#148; she gives out a bit of a sigh, &#147;Oh, so 
you know Miyuko&#146;s here already, don&#145;t you.&#148;

&#147;How&#146;d you guess?&#148; Nina grumbled in an unpleasant manner.

&#147;Because her Sex Droid is eating breakfast -- oh, thank you.&#148; (Eliza 
smiles as she takes a plate of food from Tomoyo) &#147;How&#146;s the work 
progressing?&#148;

&#147;Miyuko needs Nina to give her the data on---&#148;

&#147;WHY DIDN&#146;T YOU TELL ME SOONER?!?&#148; Nina screams, storming out of the 
room as she does. &#147;Sakura&#148; looks at her leave, frowns, then goes back 
to eating with the same strange smile on her face.

&#147;She&#146;s got Miyuko&#146;s strangeness down pat at least.&#148;

------

Once the system was up Nina couldn&#146;t wait to shove the catgirl and her 
Sex Droid into a shuttle and ship them back to the USS Ryoko ASAP. 
Problem was, however, they weren&#146;t going anywhere!

&#147;Captain wants us to give you technical backup and nerve center 
support.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ll get your back up and nerves out in no time!&#148; &#147;Sakura added.

&#147;Too late.&#148; Nina hissed, walking out of the room with the appearance 
of wanting to kill someone.

&#147;She&#146;s funny.&#148; (&#147;Sakura&#148;)

------

Nina didn&#146;t take too long to call Michi to complain about it.

Her one mistake.

Michi didn&#146;t look like she was in a very good mood since it looked 
like the call came during sex, but she took the call anyway. She 
explained (bluntly) that Miyuko was there to speed things up and there 
was nothing she could do about it.

As Rahne tended to Michi&#146;s feelings (the link severing) Nina set down 
the first ground rule of the house (despite the fact that she 
shouldn&#146;t have been making ground rules in the first place).

&#147;You&#146;re Ed.&#148;

&#147;Sakura is Sakura.&#148; Sakura pointed out, as the two (Miyuko and 
&#147;Sakura&#148;) looked at each other oddly.

&#147;No, YOU ARE ED! We can&#146;t have two Sakuras in this house! It&#146;d mess up 
communications and we&#146;d get a lot of mixed signals and awkward 
situations so from now on we&#146;re calling red here &#147;Ed&#148; until you two 
leave, got it?&#148;

&#147;Ed? Sakura is Ed?&#148;

&#147;Whatever.&#148; Nina spit out, turning to leave. &#147;You&#146;re Ed?&#148; Miyuko said, 
pointing at &#147;Ed&#148;.

&#147;Sakura is Ed, but Ed isn&#145;t Sakura -- ok?&#148;

&#147;Ok.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, Miyu-chan!&#148; &#147;Ed&#148; whispered (loudly) &#147;When Miyu-chan 
comes during sex and screams for Sakura-chan, Ed-chan won&#146;t feel 
jealous because Ed is Sakura and Sakura is---&#148;

Nina slams the door before she hears another word come out of her 
mouth.

-----

The name change seemed to help. A little.

Still the strange girl made Sakura abit nervous. It was only when the 
two promised to keep to the lower side of the house (and sleep out of 
the huge room which they converted into a &#147;nerve center&#148; did Sakura 
feel a little better about the situation).

Still, for everyone&#146;s sanity, Nina surrounded the room with sound 
nullers to block out the noises of lovemaking from the room. She also 
put alert sensors and door locks so that people couldn&#146;t walk in and 
catch an eyeful of them doing it by accident. Still, even then, she 
still felt it necessary to lay down ground rule #2 - no sex in public 
areas. Now, mind you, that might seem like common sense yet for the 
two of them it was as if Nina told them to stop breathing. Still, they 
would comply.

&#147;Ed can&#146;t have fun in---&#148;

&#147;No you can&#146;t get laid in the living room, the washroom, the bathroom, 
the main hallway and NO WAY are you getting it in the front yard!&#148; 
Nina huffed, spitting out the orders in chain fire manner. &#147;High fence 
or no I don&#146;t want you two to become a shameful public spectacle! Keep 
it in bed, got it?&#148;

&#147;Ed have fun in Sakura&#146;s---&#148;

&#147;YOUR BED!!&#148; Nina screeched, once again slamming the door and raging 
off towards the staircase. By now people have gotten used to the sound 
of slamming doors since Nina did it now daily ever since the duo of 
&#147;Sakura&#148; (who was now &#147;Ed&#148;) and Miyuko appeared.

That said, all they had to do now was wait for the first card to be 
tagged and detected by the new equipment and see if the stuff was 
working. It wouldn&#146;t take long before the first contact --

----

Or so they thought.

Nothing happened.

Days passed, and as each day grew longer Nina began to fear the worst.

The cards had become afraid of the appearance of CLAMP School and gone 
to ground to wait until the sky was clear of the menacing second 
&#147;moon&#148; in far orbit.

Still there didn&#146;t seem to be any reason to fear. No attacks came from 
the moon, and it continued to loom over everything in an errie yet 
silent manner. Still, it&#146;s presence made people concerned.

People were re-doing their wedding vows, re-drafting Dreamling Wills, 
and more and more people were holding each other in either signs of 
reassurance or love that was strengthened by the fear that came from 
staring at the new &#147;moon&#148; in the dreaming skies.

The moon was under constant surveillance. Ships from as far as Attica 
and Galmeryia were brought in to pull shifts on patrol duty over the 
moon, and constant vigilance was maintained. Yet still nothing 
happened.

No signs of demands or ultimatums, no invasion force (visible or 
secret), nothing.

It just seemed content on hanging there in orbit and waiting -- but 
for what?

The wait seemed to get on people&#146;s nerves, but as long as they were 
looking for runaway Clow Cards they had something to do -- which was 
more than other residents of the dream moon Terra who could only watch 
and wait -- for something to happen.

------

Meanwhile -- CLAMP School

Mimic sighed as she read over her journal notes again. Catherine 
insisted that the Clow girl kept a journal of her thoughts, if only 
for herself to read. Though she doubted the &#147;privacy&#148; of writing her 
thoughts down it did seem to help her, just a little.

She read her entry again.

Journal Entry 0100

&#147;A Man&#146;s worth can be determined by his ability to make his bride the 
happiest in the world.&#148;

Catherine told me this when she assigned me the task of hunting the 
young man known as 20 Faces.

She said to defeat him I would need to know him. And all I needed to 
know of him was in that line which she said was perplexing him as much 
as it would me.

Well, she got half of it right at least. I don&#146;t know what to make of 
the sentence.

I&#146;m not Fight. I don&#146;t need a male in my life to make me complete. 
Males are disappointing things after Clow Reed -- even if my 
&#147;memories&#148; of our love seem to be more and more fantasy and delusion 
with each passing day. I still feel that it happened, and even if it 
did not the &#147;experience&#148; left to me of the &#147;happenings&#148; I went through 
with &#147;him&#148; did not leave me with a good impression in terms of 
fostering future relationships between myself and those of the male 
gender as a whole.

Still, the quote that Catherine gave me made no sense, and I wasn&#146;t 
entirely sure that I wanted it to make sense. All I k now is that from 
that one line I came up with my own question.

Question - &#147;If a man&#146;s worth can be determined by his ability to make 
the woman he loves happy, what then is a woman&#146;s worth? Can she not 
too be determined by her ability to make the one she loves (either 
male or female) equally happy?&#148;

That was my question, and as I asked this question I felt my own worth 
to be next to nil. Why? Having been defeated by the red haired 
relation of the girl I was tormenting (my own other half from which I 
sprang from, Mirra) I was understandably &#147;down in the dumps&#148; in human 
terms. The wound, long healed, still &#147;stung&#148; in memory if not in 
physical reality. I still &#147;felt&#148; it&#146;s presence, and yet also felt that 
for some reason it was for the best that it happened. Creature 
comfort, but one of the few I could take from that bad ending.

My target has two mothers, or so I&#146;ve been told by Catherine. Two 
mothers. Then he&#146;s a far luckier young man than me, for I never had a 
&#147;mother&#148; to look up to. All I had, well, all we had (myself and Mirra) 
was a father figure (Clow Reed) and that&#146;s it. It would have been nice 
if I had a mother, but fate dealt me a not so favorable hand. So while 
this 20 Faces has two mothers? I have none. What a cruel little twist 
of the knife.

He thinks that at some point a male was involved. I see the two (and 
Catherine probably sees it too) as a bias on CLAMP&#146;s part against 
women in love with each other. Then again Catherine speaks from a long 
standing bias of her own against some aspects of CLAMP&#146;s &#147;universe&#148;. 
Me? I&#146;m just a realist, even if my version of &#147;reality&#148; doesn&#146;t 
necessary synch all the times with the actual reality as it stands.

When I asked Catherine what the term meant she simply shrugged and 
said &#147;Damned if I know. I just know it&#146;s important to the person your 
hunting, so if you can figure it out then maybe you can figure him 
out.&#148;

&#147;Why is it important?&#148; I asked, &#147;I don&#146;t know why it&#146;s so important to 
him.&#148;

It was then that Catherine suddenly smiled a strange smile and said, 
&#147;Funny thing, he doesn&#146;t know why it&#146;s so important to him either. Go 
figure.&#148;

One week later while on &#147;duty&#148; in my guise as a Police Officer on 
CLAMP School &#147;World&#148; I asked my &#147;partner&#148; assigned to me on the job. A 
straightforward honest man named Rhienhart. He looked me straight in 
the eye and simply said this----

&#147;The worth of a person, be it a man or a woman, is determined by that 
person alone. My own worth, or your worth, that is our&#146;s to judge and 
settle on our own the way we see our worth. While others can assure us 
of our worth in a positive or ridicule us in a negative way, it is our 
own judgement of what we are, as both individuals and as part of a 
whole in our community, and our perception of our own worth which what 
matters the most.&#148;

I didn&#146;t understand that. It was too complex -- so I just mimicked it 
for this entry without really knowing what it is he was trying to tell 
me. I then asked him this :

&#147;Is marriage important in one&#146;s worth?&#148;

&#147;Perhaps. But only if you think it&#146;s important. I think it&#146;s very 
important, but only from my point of view.&#148;

So is there merit, and thereby worth, in making someone you care about 
happy? At least, that&#146;s what I came away with from that sentence.

Card Mistress Sakura seems to think there is mert in making someone 
you care about happy, and vice versa (Card Mistress&#146; lover Tomoyo). 
Mirra also seems to think that, as does Hikaru.

But what about me? What do I think?

When I asked Catherine about this she simply shrugged and said &#147;There 
is a merit in making one you love happy. Even if, in the end, it&#146;s a 
one sided love that she will never return.&#148; then, for a moment, she 
became introspective and silent. Finally she completed her thought by 
whispering &#147;The true measure of a woman is the ability of that woman 
to love, even if her love seems hopeless and futile. To love 
unconditionally even when your certain the person your in love with 
will never feel the same way for you. That&#146;s the true measure of a 
woman to me.&#148;

I honestly think Catherine&#146;s even more messed up than I am, but that&#146;s 
her own &#147;cross&#148; she must bear.

As she flipped the book closed, locking it, the alarms went off.

&#147;Not again.&#148;

She was being summoned. So with a flick of her wrist she flung her 
journal onto her bed and walked out the door, fists clenched. &#147;20 
Faces.&#148; she muttered, eyes narrowing.

----

Tomoyo decided that the whole gang needed a break from the constant 
pressure of hunting Clow Cards.

The first thing Sakura realized when Tomoyo said they were going to 
have a little girl&#146;s night slumber party is that all the girls were 
going to be invited.

However when she saw the guests she realized she got the &#147;girls&#148; 
wrong. It was all the girls from inside the house, not from school. 
Tomoyo shrugged and whispered &#147;They were all busy tonight.&#148;

Umi, abit uncomfortable in her jammies, prodded at the material and 
sighed every few minutes, muttering &#147;Is this becoming wet? This isn&#146;t 
drawing moisture from my body, is it? I don&#146;t like dry skin. I don&#146;t 
like this material, it feels too squishy. Am I wetting it? I sleep in 
the nude. This won&#145;t make me sweaty, right?&#148;

&#147;Is there something wrong with your pajamas?&#148; Tomoyo asked, to which 
Gaia replied &#147;Umi prefers to sleep in the nude.&#148; to which Tomoyo 
nodded (having already heard Umi say that three times), causing Sakura 
to blush as she glanced at her. Tomoyo also slept in the nude from 
time to time, which usually was because she was too exhausted to dress 
after lovemaking.

Light &amp; Dark would have made a matching set if not for the fact that 
Light wore midnight black panties/bra while Dark wore soft white in 
the same design and fashion as Light. Fuu wore her usual nightie.

Cloud had skipped out of the party because Kero had gotten a batch of 
new games and she wanted to break them in with him. That, however, 
didn&#146;t stop Umi from occasionally (when not complaining about the 
state of her jammies) kidding that the two were experimenting with sex 
awkwardly in his closet/bedroom (Gaia kept reminding Umi to behave 
herself).

Keiko/Eve also were no shows despite the fact that they were invited. 
Miyuko/&#147;Ed&#148; slash &#147;Sakura&#148; didn&#146;t show up, they preferred to watch TV, 
eat and do whatever else they did in the privacy of their own room, 
which suited Nina just fine. As for Nina? She laid listlessly in a 
pile of one huge quilt and a bunch of pillows looking rather bored. 
&#147;When you said &#147;slumber party&#148; I thought you meant &#147;orgy&#148;, but this is 
dumb.&#148; she pouted, her feet kicking listlessly as she turned to look 
over at Eliza who seemed rather into the girl talk everyone was into. 
&#147;Somebody play Hentai Truth or Dare, or something which the loser ends 
up naked and at our mercies -- or something.&#148;

&#147;You might be the victim more than the rest of us if we play Hentai 
Trivial Pursuit, Nina.&#148; Eliza baited, drawing a frown from her lover. 
&#147;The questions are all stupid anyway, so what.&#148;

Silence reigned for a few seconds as Nina pouted, until, finally, she 
sat up and snapped her fingers. &#147;Let&#146;s tell raunchy stories!&#148;

A few of the girls&#146; attentions became piqued by it, but Sakura wasn&#146;t 
so sure.

&#147;I&#146;ll even start with a Sakura/Tomoyo tale if you&#146;re all interested!&#148;

Tomoyo was, Sakura was not. But as Sakura looked into her dark haired 
beloved&#146;s eyes she knew she couldn&#146;t say no -- mostly because Tomoyo 
was ordering pizza delivered in and was paying for it so Sakura wanted 
to get dibs on the first piece.

&#147;Here,&#148; Nina announced, holding up a sheet of paper, &#147;Got this from a 
website. It&#146;s kinda short but I bet if we cast Sakura/Tomoyo in it 
it&#146;d be interesting.&#148;

&#147;Your not stealing from honest fiction writers, are you?&#148; Eliza 
questioned, to which Nina frowed, &#147;I&#146;ll change it, alright? Sheesh!&#148; 
(grumbles under her breath) &#147;Why do you care if he/she is honest or 
not anyway?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m concerned about YOUR honesty.&#148;

Tomoyo, however, was more concerned with the story so quickly Nina 
started in.

Sakura Kinomoto was 16 years old. That much has to be known for this 
story to have any special significance.

&#147;Is this a naughty version of A Christmas Carol?&#147; Umi countered, to 
which Nina growled, &#147;Hush.&#147;

She goes to school with her precious beloved Tomoyo Daidouji--- 
(pausing for abit to make sure Tomoyo was blushing from ear to ear as 
she continued)--- today they were in PE, and Sakura was playing 
football when---

&#147;I don&#146;t play football.&#148; Sakura replied, to which Nina muttered &#147;You 
do now. Anyway, Sakura was---&#148;

&#147;Mistress is into cheerleading.&#148; Gaia pointed out.

(Umi) &#147;Yeah, at least get it right when you---&#148;

&#147;Alright! Alright!&#148; (Nina snapped) &#147;If the peanut gallery is through 
I&#146;ll change it!&#148; (snarls under her breath a few curses, mostly in the 
few words of Winterian she knew (all curse words) so nobody could 
understand them, before continuing) &#147;Sakura was doing her CHEERLEADING 
practice and scored the game winning touchdown when Tomoyo---&#148;

&#147;How can she score the game winning touchdown?&#148; Dawn (Light) asked.

&#147;---she caught the ball and ran it in, OK? Don&#146;t ask---&#148;

&#147;How can mistress catch the ball if they&#146;re not throwing it to her?&#148; 
(Evie/Dark).

Clearly they were pushing Nina&#145;s buttons as she turned and glared at 
Light/Dark, eyes narrowing as her blood pressure shot up tenfold. 
&#147;---it was a freak accident and it hit Sakura upside her head and she 
forgot she was a cheerleader and thought she was an all-star 
linebacker. WHO CARES?!? You want to hear the naughty part or analyze 
this to death?!? I&#146;m trying to---&#148;

&#147;Mistress would never play football.&#148;

&#147;Sakura hates football.&#148; Tomoyo added, which only seemed to make Nina 
that much more frustrated. &#147;WHATEVER!!&#148; (hisses) &#147;Sakura got hit 
upside the stupid head and fell down! Ok?!? Now as Tomoyo walked to 
her---&#148;

&#147;Isn&#146;t she worried about Mistress being out cold from the---&#148;

&#147;ARE WE GOING TO GET TO THE SEX OR WHAT?!?&#148; Nina screamed, silencing 
the room, &#147;AS I was saying---&#148; (Eliza calms Nina down enough for her 
to continue) &#147;---Tomoyo, AFTER taking care of Sakura&#146;s injuries, she 
asked Sakura---&#148;

----

&#147;Are you OK?&#148;

&#147;Hmmm---&#148; Sakura moaned, rubbing her head, &#147;I&#146;m fine. It&#146;ll take me a 
second.&#148;

At that Tomoyo knelt next to her, hugging her tightly which sent a 
warm red glow through Sakura&#146;s face, &#147;Let&#146;s walk to class, OK?&#148;

&#147;Sure.&#148;

----

&#147;But we always walk to class.&#148; (Sakura)

&#147;----&#148; (Nina) &#147;---do you mind---&#148;

&#147;Sorry.&#148;

-----

During computer class Sakura couldn&#146;t keep her eyes off of Tomoyo.

The dark haired girl did something to Sakura that made her private 
spot wet from being so close to her sweet beloved---

(This was what Nina said. What Nina was REALLY thinking was that 
Sakura was having a major panic attack while staring at the computer 
completely lost as what to do next, shaking in such a way you think 
she was about to collapse. No doubt, in Nina&#146;s mind at least, Sakura 
was probably two steps away from having a urination accident all over 
herself as she lost control of her body functions and collapsed in a 
confused messed up jumble of half screwed thoughts like the hopeless 
little waif Nina often thought she was.)

(However she kept that nice cheery &#147;thought&#148; to herself)

As they went home Tomoyo lured Sakura up to their bedroom quickly, 
kissing Sakura on her lips strongly as they held each other tightly. 
They kissed passionately, their hands massaging each other as they 
stopped holding and started fondling. She then pushed Sakura onto the 
bed, asking her in the sweetest voice if she wanted her to make Sakura 
happy. &#147;You always make me happy.&#148; she responded, smiling as Tomoyo 
went down on her, first licking Sakura&#146;s face, before moving down her 
body and paying attention to her firm nipples and---

-----

&#147;When did they undress?&#148;

Nina, head turning slowly like in the Exorcist, locked her gaze onto 
Umi. &#147;During the fondling part. Alright? Shut up.&#148;

&#147;Why didn&#146;t they do the long undressing thing and---&#148;

&#147;Do you want to be spade and neutered right here and now?&#148;

&#147;----&#148;

&#147;Shut up.&#148;

&#147;But I---&#148;

&#147;Shut. Up--- OH FORGET IT!!&#148; (Nina collapses into the quilt and 
refuses to speak again.)

&#147;Uhh---&#148; (Fuu was blushing) &#147;---anyone want some smores?&#148;

Eventually Nina was talking again (food helped).

Slowly, but surely, Tomoyo laid Sakura down on the soft bed, looking 
deeply into her eyes as she whispered to her--- (Nina blinks) --- &#147;Oh, 
wait, I&#146;m starting the scene over again.&#148; (rewind)

Tomoyo slowly but surely licked Sakura&#146;s face, ears, closed eyes, 
moving down to her throat and the top of her young breasts. With great 
skill she carefully licked each one (suckling on the nipples nibbling 
them lightly causing Sakura to shudder beneath her).

She then moved down, passing Sakura&#146;s most private spot causing her to 
whine abit as she licked her legs (holding them down as Sakura became 
frantic). Slowly she inched her way upwards, slowly, slowly she---

&#147;Go faster!&#148; Umi yelled, to which Nina snapped &#147;I&#146;M GOING AS FAST AS I 
CAN!!&#148;

Tomoyo began to kiss Sakura&#146;s sweet spot, slowly and gently at first, 
then she looked up and smiled. &#147;Ready?&#148; she whispered, to which Sakura 
nodded her head quickly, her need overwhelming her. Tomoyo rose up, 
smiling serenely as she brought her gaze downwards, one hand gently 
spreading Sakura&#146;s legs as she shoved her fist into her---

&#147;WAHHH!!&#148; Sakura screamed suddenly, giving everyone a shock.

&#147;What?!?&#148; Nina yelled in a panic, her heart no doubt pounding in her 
ears.

&#147;Tomo-chan WOULDN&#146;T DO THAT!!&#148;

Nina, now finally quite through with the interruptions, glared at 
Tomoyo, &#147;She&#146;s lying, right? You--&#148;

&#147;I&#146;d never do anything violent or rough with my Sakura-chan. I&#146;d 
prefer if &#147;Tomoyo&#148; used two fingers.&#148;

Nina looked at her as if she snapped. &#147;What sort of exciting scene 
could possibly happen with that? I mean--- augh, never mind. Forget 
it.&#148;

Nina changed the scene, and retold it again.

Sakura turned bright red, &#147;HOE!!&#148;

Nina sighed, her gaze never leaving Tomoyo&#146;s understanding and smiling 
face. &#147;Now WHAT!&#148; she demanded, to which Tomoyo replied, &#147;I&#146;d probably 
never shove my fingers into Sakura-chan&#145;s most precious spot. Gently, 
lovingly I&#146;d slowly push and stroke my fingers (two) into---&#148;

&#147;Gee that&#146;s such a bore! Why don&#146;t you two just strip and get it on 
NOW since you know so much better what would make a good sex scene!!&#148;

&#147;Well it is Sakura we&#146;re talking about here.&#148; Eliza notes, motioning 
to Sakura, &#147;She would know what makes Sakura happy in bed, right?&#148;

&#147;---not you too---&#148;

Once again, she started again, the fictional Sakura&#146;s cries rising as 
she pleaded with her beloved.

Suddenly Nina stopped again and glared at Sakura.

&#147;No, don&#146;t tell me. Sakura would NEVER scream those kind of dirty 
words --- right?&#148;

Tomoyo only smiled, &#147;She does.&#148; (Sakura blushes bright red as Tomoyo 
honestly tells Nina the answer to her question).

&#147;So is it OK if Sakura screams that?&#148;

Everyone nods their head in agreement, except for Sakura who was too 
embarrassed to say either way.

Fictional Sakura&#146;s cries of passion rise higher and higher as 
Fictional Tomoyo continues to ministrate to her. She then reaches 
beneath the bed and grabs -- Nina takes three tries before she gets it 
just right (and stops the side commentaries) -- &#147;You hate people 
telling you what to do, don&#146;t you.&#147; (Umi)

&#147;Gee. How&#146;d you guess?&#147;

Barely a minute passes before another complaint comes to light.

&#147;Since when did mistress Tomoyo indulge in that sort of sick thing?&#148; 
(Umi again)

Nina, not paying attention, went right on, making Sakura closer and 
closer to fainting from shock.

Eliza sighed, trying her best to calm Nina down. &#147;You&#146;re just being 
vindictive now, aren&#146;t you?&#148;

Nina stopped, head collapsing into her pillows, &#147;Well it&#146;s so easy to 
HATE someone in here.&#148;

Sakura blushed, lowering her gaze as she did, &#147;I can&#146;t help it! 
Tomo-chan isn&#146;t rough with me. She treats me gently. I don&#145;t want to 
make comments about your story, but Tomo-chan would never---&#148;

Nina finally gave up. Sighing as she rolled over onto her back (mostly 
to avoid everyone&#146;s gazes) she gave in. &#147;Why don&#146;t you finish it, 
Tomoyo? I&#146;m just worn out.&#148;

&#147;Nina---&#148; she whispered, but Nina wouldn&#146;t speak anymore. Finally 
Tomoyo decided to continue the story.

Nina, however, wasn&#146;t listening. Her view was blocked as Eliza rolled 
on top of her, smiling, &#147;What am I ever going to do with such a bossy 
little lover like you?&#148;

The two kissed passionately as Tomoyo kept the others&#146; attention on 
the story.

Tomoyo smiled, leaning over and whispering something only into 
Sakura&#146;s ear which caused the girl first to blush, then to turn red. 
Everyone looked and became rather confused.

&#147;What is she whispering about?&#148; Gaia asked, to which Umi remarked 
&#147;Don&#145;t ask.&#148;
