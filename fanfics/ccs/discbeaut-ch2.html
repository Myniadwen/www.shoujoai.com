<h1>Discovering Beauty (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jbrown.html">James Brown</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/discbeaut-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>There was no feeling of joy in the dark haired girl&#39;s senses afterwards.
Tomoyo spent the entire evening inside her room and refused human contact
from anyone else in the house. She laid down on top of her bed with her
head embedded in her pillow. She began to weep as her sobs were muffled by
the thick cushion. There was no way for her to understand why Sakura
rejected her without any clear motive. Tomoyo couldn&#39;t stop thinking about
why things went wrong for her. She lifted her head up and glanced across
the room at the camcorder. She had recorded many images with it and had
captured many memories, but the subject of a vast majority of those
memories was Sakura. Whether it was getting footage of the capture of a
Clow Card, or taking shots while walking through the park, Tomoyo would
always playback anything that had her best friend in it. The thought of
Sakura use to shine a beacon of joy within Tomoyo&#39;s heart, but tonight,
sadness was the only feeling that rested in her heart. Tomoyo didn&#39;t think
she would ever watch any of her videos again, or even use the camcorder
again. The dark haired girl placed her head on her pillow and cried as
heartache overtook her senses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The whole situation was still confusing for Sakura. After spending almost
an entire day&#39;s time thinking about it, Sakura decided to do some
rollerblading to clear her head. But gliding down the sidewalk in the
early afternoon didn&#39;t make any difference. &#39;What did she mean by it?&#39;
Sakura thought to herself. &#39;And why did she do it? I still don&#39;t
understand.&#39; Sakura fully understood Tomoyo&#39;s intention for writing the
letter, what she didn&#39;t understand was how it could be natural for Tomoyo
to feel that way. &#39;Was she just joking about it? Hmm...no, that&#39;s
probably not it. She wouldn&#39;t have done anything like that to me. But how
could she say all that and mean it?&#39; As Sakura continued skating, her
thoughts went to what was actually said in Tomoyo&#39;s letter. Sakura
recalled the feelings of emotion that the letter tried to convey. She
didn&#39;t think much of it at first, but the more she thought about it, the
more she related it to all of the moments she was with Tomoyo. She thought
about all of the times that Tomoyo looked up to her and gave her support
when she was a card captor. She thought about the times when the two of
them would just hand out together. The one thing that Sakura rememberd the
most about Tomoyo was the way she looked at her. Tomoyo&#39;s eyes were always
full of cheerfulness and affection, and now that Sakura had read the
letter, she understood why Tomoyo always had that look of affection. The
brown haired girl&#39;s thoughts began to effect how fast she was moving on her
rollerblades. Her speed decreased until she came to a stop at a street
corner. As Sakura stood motionless, she thought about how much Tomoyo
cared for her, about how much her heart went out to Sakura. Then her mind
went back to how she treated Tomoyo the other day, the way she abandoned
her best friend without telling her how she felt. She was beginning to get
mad at herself for reacting that way and she was starting to imagine how
Tomoyo was feeling about all of this. Sakura was afraid of committing the
crime she hoped never to commit, breaking the feelings of her best friend.
Tomoyo&#39;s bright smile was something that the brown haired girl loved to see
and it got to her that she might not see it again. But as guilt was making
its way into the girl, another feeling came in that was even stronger. The
feelings that Sakurta had for Tomoyo were tremendous. Sakura had always
felt that she wanted to help out her friend if she felt sad or worried.
Her desire to help was greater than it had ever been, even while she knew
that she was the cause of the problem. It was now she realized that she
cared about her friend so much, that she loved her. This new discovery
shocked Sakura as well as added to her confusion. It was hard for her to
think that she could feel that strongly toward another girl. There was
nothing that seemed logical in the situation that Sakura was in. The brown
haired girl was lost in the thoughts of her mind until she heard something
approach. As she looked forward to see what brought her back to reality,
she saw that a black car was coming down the street. It didn&#39;t take Sakura
long to recognize the vehicle. &quot;That&#39;s Tomoyo&#39;s car,&quot; she said. As the
car passed her, Sakura was able to get a good look inside. Sakura noticed
the driver and Tomoyo&#39;s bodyguards and, for a brief instant, saw that
Tomoyo was riding along with them. But it was the expression on Tomoyo&#39;s
face that got Sakura&#39;s attention. The dark haired girl had her head hung
low with a lok of utter depression. It was obvious to Sakura how her
friend felt as the car drove by. Sakura watched until the vehicle was out
of sight. The girl became concerned over what she had seen. But even as
she felt sorry for her best friend, she cringed after seeing the results of
her actions firsthand.
