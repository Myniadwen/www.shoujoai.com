<h1>Figure Eight</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Tomoyo could whistle it in her sleep. In fact now, while she laid in 
bed staring listlessly at the ceiling, she could remember the entire 
song word for word if she wanted to.

The song was not Japanese in origin, in fact it&#146;s American from a show 
from the Waking World during the 70&#146;s--- but the memories of the music 
still haunt Tomoyo.

She first heard it when she was eight herself. Her father played it 
along with other songs from that series, but he said he liked that 
song the best and so did she (at the time).

However, her memories of the song are not happy ones of when she was 
eight.

They&#146;re of when she was a little older--- nine--- and the memories 
associated with that song.

The song would play for 3 minutes. Most of the songs only played for 3 
minutes.

When she was nine, father began to compliment her on how she was 
becoming a mature young woman, growing up so fast. Tomoyo, who had a 
crush on her father (like some girls her age) relished the praise he 
heaped on her and sought to gain his approval.

One day while they were alone he became &#147;affectionate&#148; to her--- and 
the song played a role in that &#147;affection&#148;. He played it loud so it 
would inspire, but in reflection Tomoyo realized later he played it 
loud to mask her cries. There was much preparation before hand too, 
and Tomoyo knew what would make her father quite happy.

Before Fuu, who cared for and loved Tomoyo like a sister and would 
never hurt her, there was another maid who her father hired. Sonomi 
trusted him then, and she didn&#146;t think twice of his choice. She worked 
hard, she was kind to Tomoyo, she was a good person. However, behind 
closed doors, she was very affectionate to father, and Tomoyo would 
watch in youthful ignorance, fascinated as she placed his father-thing 
between her breasts and made father happy. She&#146;d use her mouth to 
&#147;kiss&#148;, and love her father&#146;s thing--- she couldn&#146;t put it to words 
then and doing so now only hurt Tomoyo each time she tried to think 
the words she wanted to say to describe what happened. She only knew 
then that she was making him happy, and she wanted to make him happy 
too.

But that was then. This is now. And her feelings when she thought of 
what happened is why she hasn&#146;t told anyone yet. She could never 
muster within herself the words to say what happened. It hurt her so 
to think of it even now, 7 years after the fact. The pain never really 
went away it seems. The pain always stood close to her heart 
threatening to smother it if she thought about it or lingered too long 
on a thought which would only bring that pain back if she reflected on 
it too long.

When he was ready he&#146;d pat the maid on the head, and she&#146;d move aside 
to start the music. The house was empty anyway, as of yet the 
Bodyguards had not been hired and she was the one maid who lived in 
the estate full time so they had the entire house to themselves while 
Sonomi was at work.

She had three minutes to begin during the first playing, and she was 
always excited when it came her turn to make father happy. She 
couldn&#146;t quite grasp in her young mind what she was doing then, it 
only seemed like father loved her attention and favored her over the 
maid when he wanted to be happy.

In the end, she figured, Tomoyo at nine equated his &#147;happiness&#148; with 
his love for her, and couldn&#146;t understand what was going on or what 
she was doing. She could now, years later, but then--- she wished she 
was as smart as Sakura-chan often said she was, or she would had known 
then what she knows now. Still, it seemed so harmless back then. Then 
again she what she didn&#146;t know would hurt her one day--- and stay with 
her for much longer past that. If only she was wiser beyond her years 
when she was nine.

The first time the song played she would grasp it with her young 
hands, and stroke--- the thought suddenly makes Tomoyo wretch 
involuntarily, her stomach gripping as she clenches her teeth and 
winces in bed slightly. But that made it--- well--- she&#146;d then lick it 
with her young tongue as it---

Forget it. Push it away, she thought to herself--- thinking back to a 
few hours ago.

Sakura, on her back, sighs as Tomoyo gently licks her womanhood. Each 
lick, suckle on her clit, and every little bit of attention to her nub 
makes Sakura shudder as she--- her father sighs, calling Tomoyo a good 
girl, begging her to--- Tomoyo eyes shut tighter, her teeth grind 
together, her arms tremble.

Think about Sakura. Only precious Sakura-chan. Just Sakura.

All she wants to do is hold the image of her beloved in her mind, but 
her thoughts keep wandering as she tries to hold those precious 
thoughts close to her heart. Sakura. Think only of Sakura. Sakura.

She thinks about how Sakura returned the favor in turn, making Tomoyo 
feel light as air as her body is wracked in pleasures, each dip and 
lick of her tongue setting new fires within her body. Her loving 
lips--- locked on her nipple as she laid on her back, father near to 
happiness. He pushes her legs apart as he traces a figure eight on her 
chest, whispering something he always whispered to her when they did 
this, suddenly he--- she cries out only to stifle her scream. Dear 
goddess, she almost woke Sakura-chan. That she didn&#146;t want to wake 
her, so she slips out of bed and goes into the upstairs kitchen 
nearby. Once there she reaches into the fridge, retrieves the bottle 
of cognac in it, and pours herself a drink. Sitting down, she turns 
her attention to the drink and stares at it. The dark liquid reflected 
her face shadowed in darkness--- almost fitting considering the way 
she felt right now. Suddenly, she hears the door open, but doesn&#146;t 
react to it. It&#146;s not Sakura-chan, that much she knows. The footfalls 
are too heavy. It must be---

&#147;Isn&#146;t the little lady too young for this?&#148; Aieka whispers, taking the 
glass of cognac away from her. The only reason there&#146;s cognac in the 
fridge in the first place was that Eliza made a dessert with cognac 
one night as Christmas drew near, and she left some in the fridge for 
another dessert on Christmas Eve.

It was Sunday, December 22nd, and Christmas was three days away.

Tomoyo didn&#146;t speak, she only stared at the table weary. Aieka took a 
sip of the drink and sat down next to her. &#147;Eliza is going to wonder 
whose been hitting her cooking cognac.&#148;

&#147;----&#148;

&#147;Nina will probably blame Umi for it since she was the one who 
polished off the last bottle in the fridge (amazing how she can drink 
so much and yet still be capable of being a sober designated driver--- 
that is if she ever learns how to drive.)&#148;

Again, nothing. Tomoyo only sat there and stared quietly at her hands 
where the drink once stood.

&#147;Little lady? Is there something---&#148;

&#147;No. I better go to bed---&#148; she quickly remarks, standing, only to be 
stopped by her. &#147;Your thinking about it again, aren&#146;t you. I can see 
it in your eyes.&#148;

&#147;No I&#146;m not---&#148;

&#147;I know you are. My precious little miss can&#146;t lie to me for an 
instant.&#148; she pried, motioning for her to sit back down which she did 
with great reluctance. &#147;Care to talk about it?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know--- what to say--- that I wouldn&#145;t want to say to 
Sakura-chan--- first.&#148; she sighed, the weight of her thoughts weighing 
down.

&#147;I know what you must be thinking of--- when we first got here, hired 
by your mother, I remember when she told us our instructions. Protect 
you, of course, but the one thing she wanted us to remember---&#148;

-----

Aieka&#146;s Flashback

&#147;Protect her from all males??&#148; Aieka asked, looking at the other 
female bodyguards on their first day there, looking abit uncertain 
about that order. &#147;What do---&#148;

&#147;I want her protected from men, ESPECIALLY her parasite of a father!&#148;

&#147;?&#148; Aieka looked about, only to nod 

&#147;Do you have a problem with that?&#148; Sonomi asked, a bit of irritation 
in her voice, to which Aieka only shakes her head in the negative. 
&#147;Good. One slip up and you&#146;re fired. Understand?&#148;

Before Aieka could nod her head again she found herself alone as 
everyone split up and left her. As she looked about she realized the 
other guards already heard this speech before she got there (being 
last hired) and was set on their new boss&#146; confusing orders. Still, if 
she wanted them to keep men away from her daughter who were they to 
say otherwise? Eventually she specified which men (the next day) but 
for now that order seemed odd--- until she nearly ran over Fuu, the 
new maid, as she was doing her duties, knocking over all the neatly 
folded towels in Fuu&#146;s hands. Quickly she set to help Fuu put the 
towels back in order, and while they were working she mentioned her 
predecessor and the father Aieka was to keep away from the young Miss 
Tomoyo.

------

Fuu&#146;s Flashback (within a flashback)

She was there the last night he lived in the house. The last night.

That was her third day there under the senior maid and her orders were 
to simply take the rest of the night off. That, in itself seemed odd, 
since she was certain Miss Sonomi wanted her to help the senior maid 
with Miss Tomoyo&#146;s needs. She felt that she was a disappointment to 
the house and she would be fired soon, especially since she couldn&#146;t 
care for Miss Tomoyo at night which was one of the duties she was 
supposed to undertake.

She wanted to prove to everyone that she was capable of doing her job 
before she lost that job, and she had the idea as to how to do that. 
That day Fuu noticed that Miss Tomoyo seemed a little down about going 
to her new school in a week (starting third grade) and Fuu wanted to 
cheer her up. She made dessert for her and was going to sneak it 
upstairs to settle Miss Tomoyo&#146;s nerves as a treat for her. She 
thought that&#146;d prove she could care for Miss Tomoyo and save her job. 
That&#146;s when she heard the noise---

It was music playing just out of earshot, but something else. As she 
came up to Miss Tomoyo&#146;s room she heard the noise clearer now, and it 
came from the room. It seemed--- like grunts and groans? She was 
uncertain, but as she carefully peeked through the door she was 
certain Miss Tomoyo was watching the huge widescreen TV (Miss Tomoyo 
had a fondness for police dramas)--- what she saw when she opened that 
door an inch stunned her into silence.

Mr. Daidouji, naked, grabbed Tomoyo&#146;s legs and yanked them apart 
and--- the rest she couldn&#146;t see very well from her spot at the 
door--- she saw the senior maid (naked on top of Tomoyo) reach for him 
and--- Tomoyo screamed as he jammed himself towards her. She screamed, 
and screamed until finally the senior maid leaned forward, at that 
moment Fuu was certain she was helping him orgasm--- with the tip of 
his--- inside of sweet precious Tomoyo-chan who he tried to force 
his--- she watched stunned and stupidfied, not even realizing time was 
passing until she felt a sharp pain in her arm. She had stood there 
petrified for a few minutes and didn&#146;t even notice he was until until 
the next thing she remembers is him grabbing her and trying to hurt 
her. She ran, and called the police. She later found out that he fled 
the house with his &#147;lover&#148;, and they disappeared.

Money (of course) quickly disappeared from the Daidouji Estates 
accounts, but Sonomi was no fool. The house, the main assets, the 
business, everything was in her name. What he took was pocket change 
in comparison to what she had, but it was enough to make him and the 
former senior maid disappear without a trace. Everyone searched for 
him, but in vain--- he was gone.

And, it seems, the damage was done. When she went back to see Tomoyo 
as he was fleeing the house (oblivious to Tomoyo&#146;s pain and suffering) 
she was still lying where they left her, legs spread and red fluids 
coming from her--- the maid ran to her and held her tight, comforting 
the crying girl promising never to leave her side. She hasn&#146;t since 
that day.

End of Fuu&#146;s Flashback (as told by Aieka)

----

Seven years has passed, which is odd since here in the Realm of Dreams 
time doesn&#146;t pass.

For the sake of sentient minds, who are slaves to the passage of time, 
they keep and track it as if it were gold even though it meant little 
in a place as eternal as Edenina. The passage of the seconds, minutes, 
hours, each tracked for the sake of memories and the convenience of 
those who remember living by the clock and find themselves unable to 
stop even now. And, for Tomoyo, it was as if time really was not 
moving because while she matured, grew into a fine young woman, it 
seemed that the moment her father destroyed her image of his 
affections to her, violating her against her will, would be with her 
forever.

End of Aieka&#146;s Flashback

------

Tomoyo nods her head, and looks up to stare into Aieka&#146;s eyes. &#147;I want 
to tell Sakura-chan---&#148;

&#147;Tell her? You mean---&#148;

&#147;Tell her everything. She deserves to know. She&#146;s been nothing but 
truthful and honest to me since the beginning. She&#146;s held nothing 
back, hid nothing from me, she&#146;s been honest to me from Day 1. I want 
to be as honest to her in turn--- but I&#146;m afraid.&#148;

&#147;Afraid of what?&#148;

&#147;---I&#146;m afraid---&#148; she whispers, only to run out of the room before 
Aieka could stop her. As she watches the kitchen door fall close 
behind Miss Tomoyo, she sighs and drinks from the glass again.

&#147;You can&#146;t run away from him forever, my little miss.&#148;

Figure Eight.

It&#146;s a simple enough song.

Tomoyo knows it by heart, but for all the wrong reasons.

The beginning is a few seconds of the haunting music--- low and 
soft---- as it works it&#146;s way to the lyrics. They&#146;re easy enough as 
well.

Sakura was awake when Tomoyo returned to the bedroom. She knew Tomoyo 
left, but was uncertain about what to do. Tomoyo smiled her gentle 
smile, and crawled into bed and Sakura&#146;s waiting arms, cuddling her as 
she felt Sakura whisper soft reassurances.

Sweet Sakura-chan. She only wanted Tomoyo to be happy. She never 
wanted to see her in pain, or crying, and she felt awful each time she 
made her precious Sakura worry about her.

As they laid back down, Sakura holding onto her tight, she tried to 
remember the good times---

---as the song played in her head in her sleep once again.

The music is slow, described in the subtitles as &#147;Pop Ballad&#148; music. 
As it moves ahead slowly the memories slowly begin to whirl and come 
forward again, both happy and bad memories together.

Figure Eight--- as double Four.

Figure Four--- as half of Eight.

(Father holding her shoulders as she grips with both hands, her tongue 
lapping and---)

If you skate it would be great--- if you could make--- a figure eight.

(Sakura calling out Tomoyo&#146;s name as she locks her lips to Sakura&#146;s 
womanhood, feeling it---)

That&#146;s a circle that turns &#145;round upon itself.

&#147;My little angel&#146;s curves are coming in.&#148; She remembers him saying 
once, his finger tracing a figure eight on her chest as she looked up 
at him. She was only nine. She didn&#146;t know better. She wished now, 
with all her heart, that she did know. For Sakura&#146;s sake--- so that 
she never had to worry about Tomoyo each time she found Tomoyo crying 
in her sleep. She didn&#146;t want to trouble Sakura with her troubles. But 
her memories wouldn&#146;t let her simply forget--- she had to tell Sakura.

But she was afraid to tell her.

Figure Eight.

It&#146;s a simple song, but it carries nothing but bad memories for 
Tomoyo.

The song in and of itself is beautiful, but the memories is not.

The song continues with a teacher helping out--- memories of father&#146;s 
maid comes to mind.

1x8 is 2x4.

(The maid&#146;s breasts were big, but Tomoyo was determined to make father 
proud as she---)

4x4 is 2x8.

(Sakura diligently massaged Tomoyo&#146;s breasts as she licked, nibbled 
and toyed with her nipples)

If you skate---

(Memory the darkest moment of her life--- it was snowing that day and 
she was near the huge artificial lake in King Penguin Park which was 
closed to ice skaters---)

---upon thin ice---

(A blurred image of someone pounding on the ice from beneath, face 
frozen in fear)

---you&#146;d be wise if you thought twice---

(Sakura falling over while learning how to ice skate for the first 
time)

---before you make another single move---

(Tomoyo curled up in the fetal position on the ice, her bottom nude 
and bleeding, her tears flowing hard as she cries in pain. Something 
beneath the ice was pounding, accentuated with muffled screams. That&#146;s 
when something black took her up and carried her to safety. Her eyes 
stun from her own tears of pain so she couldn&#145;t see well, all she knew 
was it was a woman, and she work this soft black clothing. She felt 
comforting as she held Tomoyo close, as comforting as death 
perhaps---)

She didn&#146;t want to remember anymore after that. Her mind finally gave 
up to her need for sleep.

She fell asleep in Sakura&#146;s arms, feeling safe as long as she was 
within her love&#146;s arms.

As long as she kept the memories at bay she would always be safe. 
Always.

As long as she kept the memories at bay----

-------

Figure Eight.

It&#146;s easy enough to remember.

Tomoyo remembers it, even in her deepest sleep as it drifts 
occasionally into the farthest edge of her conscious. Not close enough 
to note but playing there all the same to tingle her deepest thoughts 
and fears as the words play out like a faint buzz in the backdrop. The 
first lyrics echo in the back of her head as she falls into deep 
slumber.

Figure Eight, as double four.

Figure Four, as half of eight.

If your skate it would be great--- if you could make--- a figure 
eight.

That&#146;s a circle that goes &#145;round about itself.

1x8 is 2x4. 4x4 is 2x8.

If you skate upon thin ice, you&#146;d be wise if you thought twice---

Before you made another single move.

-------

Tomoyo&#146;s eyes flickered as she stirred from her sleep, awaking to the 
smell of--- breakfast?

As she slowly sat up she was surprised to see Sakura, dressed already 
and wearing her apron that Tomoyo got her, sitting at the foot of the 
bed watching her get up. With a slight flourish she spun towards the 
cart set to one side and slid off the cover of the cart to expose two 
trays of food (kept warm beneath the cart&#146;s domed area). Sakura sets 
down Tomoyo&#146;s food, takes her place with her food, and pours the two a 
glass of juice (set into it&#146;s holder on the tray which kept the glass 
locked into place to avoid spills). &#147;I was worried about you so I 
wanted to make you breakfast in bed.&#148; she remarked, noticing Tomoyo&#146;s 
inquisitive gaze as she looked down at her own food blushing abit. 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry if this isn&#146;t what you want---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s perfect.&#148; Tomoyo complimented, sliding over to kiss Sakura on 
the cheek, &#147;You always know how to cheer me up when I&#146;m being such a 
downer.&#148;

&#147;Your not a downer to me.&#148; Sakura rebutted, munching on her food only 
after watching Tomoyo set into eating the food on her plate. The 
breakfast was a very hearty one at that, with a huge mushroom and 
cheese omelet with little bits of bacon cooked into it, with rice and 
sausage and hash browns to boot.

This, of course, was taught to her by Nina since it was her favorite 
breakfast. But, after trying it, Tomoyo found out it was one of her 
favorite breakfasts as well and Sakura liked the challenge of cooking 
it. It gave her a chance to put her fledgling cooking skills to the 
test, and it made Tomoyo happy when she spent the time and effort when 
Sakura cooked one of these elaborate breakfasts for her.

Off to one side, sitting near the door, Tomoyo noticed that Sakura 
took her ice skates out of the closet again. &#147;Going down to the ice 
rink today?&#148; Tomoyo asked, &#147;Or are the road icy enough to skate on?&#148;

The pond in New King Penguin Park is frozen over and I thought we&#146;d go 
ice skating. We already did most of our shopping and it&#146;d be nice to 
take a break this morning. We can always do some more shopping in the 
afternoon after the morning crowds thinned abit if we need to--- 
Tomoyo?&#148;

Tomoyo realized she was staring at Sakura oddly, which she quickly 
shook off. &#147;Nothing. I was just thinking how cute you are in your 
winter clothes all bundled up with that adorable rabbit cap.&#148;

&#147;---Tomoyo-chan!&#148; Sakura blushed at Tomoyo&#146;s compliment, unaware that 
the dark haired girl was deflecting her inquiry with gentle but 
truthful praise. Tomoyo knew that once Sakura set her mind on 
something that she couldn&#146;t bring herself to say no, so she knew she 
was going.

&#145;As long as she&#146;s there---&#146; Tomoyo thinks to herself, &#145;I&#146;ll be 
alright.&#146;

-------

The pond was filled with skaters, yet there was enough room for more 
people to file onto the ice and start skating, which is exactly what 
Sakura did when she laced her skates up and went onto the ice with a 
bit of a shaky stance. It&#146;s been awhile since she last ice skated so 
she needed to get her ice legs back under her before she could be 
comfortable skating again.

When they first arrived Sakura wanted to suggest that they take the 
small picnic lunch they made and eat it in the wooded area near the 
lake--- that is, until Tomoyo said, &#147;Then we can invite the Lady in 
White who haunts there to eat with us! That&#146;d be so much fun!&#148; (Sakura 
promptly forgot all about the idea and went skating straight away.)

There was no &#147;lady in white&#148; haunting that area, and Tomoyo felt a 
little ashamed of herself for lying to Sakura. Still, she didn&#146;t want 
to go near those trees--- and she didn&#146;t want to remember why she 
hated those trees either. The thought was so close, but she pushed it 
back without a second&#146;s hesitation.

Tomoyo smiled for Sakura, reassuring her even if she didn&#146;t feel all 
that reassured herself. The memories were clawing at her, wanting to 
come out, as were another memory--- but it was stuck fast. All she 
wanted was for it to stay &#147;stuck&#148;, and for her other memories to leave 
her alone--- until she could tell Sakura everything and hopefully put 
it all to rest. As she put on her own skates she noticed with a slight 
smile how Sakura took the straps and buckles of one of her old pairs 
of rollerblades and had someone put them on her ice skates so they 
were easy to put on and take off. &#147;I have to do that one day.&#148; Tomoyo 
whispers to herself as she finishes lacing up her skates.

Unintentionally she remembers something Rena told her once---

------

Tomoyo&#146;s flashback.

Once Tomoyo was troubled with her bad visions while in school, and it 
left her with a sour face. She didn&#146;t even notice it until she passed 
a rather annoyed Rena and the older woman stopped. With a slightly 
confused expression she turned back, and called for Tomoyo. The two 
walked towards each other, Tomoyo curious as to why she was stopped 
until she felt Rena&#146;s fingers on the tips of her frown. &#147;If I live and 
breathe, is that a genuine frown on your face or are you just mocking 
me?&#148;

Tomoyo quickly goes blank, shaking off the touch trying to recover, 
&#147;N-no---&#148;

&#147;Didn&#146;t think so.&#148; Rena responded, motioning for Tomoyo to follow her 
into a nearby bathroom where they had a measure of privacy. As she set 
Tomoyo next to a sink she looked on with an expectant face. &#147;Well?&#148;

&#147;Well?&#148;

&#147;Why are you so gloomy?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not--- I didn&#145;t know---&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t even know your gloomy? Have a lot on your mind?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Tell someone about it. If not me then Sakura, or someone you can 
trust--- maybe not Nina because she&#146;s a total knob but tell someone.&#148;

&#147;W-why?&#148;

&#147;It always helps me feel better about something.&#148;

&#147;Even if it&#146;s--- something bad?&#148;

Rena&#146;s smile disappears as her own frown returns. &#147;Especially if it&#146;s 
bad. Makes the burden less to bear if you have someone who can help 
you carry it and make it lighter. Doesn&#146;t work all the time, but---&#148;

End of Flashback

------

As she goes onto the ice, taking a practice spin about the whole span 
of the pond, her thoughts wander abit. &#145;No.&#146; she firmly thinks to 
herself, &#145;Stay focused.&#146; As she focused she felt a presence near her 
only to turn and find Sakura skating next to her, &#147;Are you OK?&#148;

&#147;Hmm. I&#146;m fine. Why? What&#146;s---&#148;

&#147;You look like you&#146;re about to cry.&#148;

&#147;---?---&#148; Tomoyo stared on, realizing her emotions were reading on her 
face like an open book. She tries to excuse herself only to feel 
Sakura tug on her sleeve for her to stay where she was. With a sigh 
she stays at Sakura&#146;s side, skating the pond with her as they talked. 
&#147;Is it something---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m---&#148; Tomoyo whispers, trying to put her words into focus, &#147;I have 
to tell you something.&#148;

&#147;What? I&#146;m listening.&#148;

&#147;Not here.&#148; Tomoyo looked about, &#147;Can I tell you later? It&#146;s kinda 
private---&#148;

&#147;Ok. Should we head---&#148;

&#147;No! No. Let&#146;s skate--- and then afterwards have a nice lunch and go 
shopping. I promise I&#146;ll tell you tonight, Sakura-chan---&#148; (Tomoyo 
reaches over and briefly touches Sakura&#146;s pouty face) &#147;Let me do it on 
in my own time. Please?&#148; Sakura&#146;s smile returns a little, and she nods 
her head as she passes Tomoyo by nudging her. &#147;I understand.&#147; she 
whispers, leaning over to kiss Tomoyo once on the cheek before skating 
ahead. &#147;Catch up if you can!&#148;

&#147;Hey! No fair!&#148; Tomoyo calls out, picking up her speed, thinking 
faster, faster----

&#147;Faster, precious! Faster! Fast---!&#148;

Tomoyo&#146;s legs slip out from under her, sending her crashing into the 
ice.

In the distance she hears Sakura scream, and hears people racing 
towards her.

In the distance---

-------

For the longest time Tomoyo&#146;s conscious floated disconnected from her 
senses.

She couldn&#146;t tell how long had passed, but she felt spacey. The fall 
really knocked her for a loop. She knew she was OK, she could feel 
that, but she was just--- floating--- in her own mind.

In the back of her own mind, she heard someone speaking. &#147;I have to 
tell you something.&#148; she whispered. &#147;I have to tell you something.&#148;

The voice asked again, and she began to tell her story--- with her 
audience being the lofty clouds and blue &#147;skies&#148; of her mind&#146;s eye. 
She felt calm and comfortable talking to the voice--- it made her feel 
safe even now. As she talked it all started to come out.

Figure Eight.

The song was playing in the distance as she talked, if only to 
herself. She relayed everything she remembered to the voice in her 
head, knowing she would have to do it again for Sakura.

She remembered when she was nine, and how father taught her oral sex.

He would trace a Figure Eight on her chest and remark about how her 
breasts would &#147;grow in&#148; one day and how beautiful she would be.

She remembered when her father tried to rape her, and how he abandoned 
her in her pain.

She remembered how Fuu came to her, and held her until the medics 
arrived and her mother raced to be with her, crying as she first 
entered her hospital room and saw her daughter in pain.

Tomoyo was given the best room in the hospital, and first class 
private care. Sonomi spared no expense in healing her daughter, though 
the greatest amount of healing would come later as she mended mentally 
from what happened that night. In a sense, she now thinks, she had 
never fully healed.

A part of what he did, a scar that could not be seen or touched, 
remained.

And it haunted her to this day.

She remembered her mother&#146;s loving attention afterwards, and how she 
blamed herself for what happened. After that, even if she couldn&#146;t be 
there with Tomoyo, she wanted to be there in someway. If not through 
the loving care of their new maid Fuu, or the vigilant eyes of her new 
bodyguards, she wanted Tomoyo to always know she was there for her.

Sonomi was the one who told her straight out that the man she called 
father wasn&#146;t her father.

She told Tomoyo about how she loved another woman once, and one day 
lost her to their teacher (this much she knew), but then she said 
more. How from the first day she came to work with her father at the 
family business (a toy company) she was befriended by a young man who 
worked there (before she inherited it) and how he stood by her when 
she unexpectedly became President of Daidouji Co. upon her father&#146;s 
passing. They grew closer and closer together until--- at this Sonomi 
would say no more, but she did say that before he left they made 
love--- only once--- but she was the result of their love. In the end 
he let her go, that&#146;s all she could say of it, and whether he died, 
left, or what not Tomoyo did not know.

She did suspect a possible reason though. She thought that he realized 
that Sonomi would truly love only Nadeshiko, and no matter how much he 
cared for her he would never be able to win her heart like Nadeshiko 
did--- so he let her go because he loved her so.

She knew then that she was born of a great but sad love.

It would be a fear that would later make her reluctant to speak of her 
feelings for Sakura.

Fearing that she could lose Sakura forever, she could never bring 
herself to fully speak of her feelings, allowing only hints and bits 
of her heart&#146;s intentions out without meaning to. She only wanted 
Sakura-chan to be happy, even if it meant she would find happiness in 
the arms of another.

When Sakura was planning to leave with Li she thought her world would 
come crashing down around her. She did, in fact, take a trip with him 
to The Shining Star (Hong Kong&#146;s dream continent) and she thought she 
had lost Sakura forever. When winter came she tried to forget--- but 
couldn&#146;t. Sakura was gone for awhile now and she hadn&#146;t heard back 
from her--- that&#146;s when she ran into her father--- no, stepfather. 
When she saw him he looked as sad and depressed as she felt. She 
thought they could reconcile, come to terms. She was coming back from 
school so she put her bag down and sat next to him, trying to console 
him. He simply starred at her, and then he choked once and a tear ran 
down his cheek. As he stood up Tomoyo tried to stop him but he would 
only motion for her to follow him.

As she walked with him he started to cry, and mutter &#147;I&#146;m sorry--- I&#146;m 
sorry--- I&#146;m sorry---&#148;

That&#146;s when it happened. As they walked into a secluded spot he spun 
about and her world went dark. As she felt herself hit the ground he 
was on top of her, pulling her panties free.

What happened next even Tomoyo could not put to words--- she wanted 
to, even if only to assure herself that what happened next was---- but 
then, it happened. Her last barrier broke, and she put the last etches 
of her pains down and confronted them--- and at that moment she smiled 
as her senses returned.

She first wanted to panic, feeling Sakura was listening to her this 
whole time, but as she slowly woke from her hazy world she saw Sakura 
sitting near her looking comforting though pained. She would stop 
Tomoyo from running, that is if she had the sense left to run--- all 
Sakura had to do was take Tomoyo into her arms and comfort her as she 
spoke--- and finished telling Sakura what she had to. 

She sat in his lap, and he violated her. She had no control, his hands 
were locked onto her hips and he was the one who did all the motions 
despite the fact he screamed for her to go faster. That&#146;s why she fell 
earlier, that one thought triggered her memories--- and she was taken 
aback by it and she lost her concentration and came crashing down into 
the ice. Sakura assures her that she&#146;s OK, but Tomoyo didn&#146;t feel 
OK--- just yet. She had to finish what she started to tell her.

She wanted to scream at him, make him stop--- but she was still 
emotionally crushed from losing Sakura so she stopped caring at that 
moment. Her stepfather was raping her and she stopped caring about 
everything. The world seemed to melt away in her mind, and the song 
started again--- she knew it by heart.

Figure Eight as double four.

Figure Four as half of eight.

Tears flowed down Tomoyo&#146;s cheeks, the pain was unbearable.

If you skate it would be great if you could make--- a figure eight.

That&#146;s a circle that goes &#145;round about itself.

Tomoyo screams out as her forced moment hits, followed by his moment. 
This part she says no more on, but Sakura nods her head and climbs 
into bed with Tomoyo, pulling Tomoyo on top of her to hold her tight 
to keep the cold out as she spoke, each word chilling her to the bone.

1x8 is 2x4. 4x4 is 2x8.

He collapses backwards, falling off the stump he sat on, Tomoyo 
falling free of him and into the cold snow. She pulls herself up, her 
legs shaky as pain ripped through her body--- all she wanted to do was 
run away even if it hurt her by doing so. She wanted to get away. She 
didn&#146;t care where.

If you skate---

She runs onto the ice by accident, her legs slipping out as she slides 
half naked across the cold sheet, the cold ripping into her adding to 
the pain she felt already.

---upon thin ice---

As he stumbles onto the ice, his weight proves to be more than 
Tomoyo&#146;s and the ice breaks beneath him as he draws near plunging him 
into the water. Disoriented he swims towards Tomoyo who is lying on 
solid ice.

---you&#146;d be wise if you thought twice---

Her last memories of him was of him pounding against the ice, &#147;dying&#148; 
(drowning) beneath her.

He was not one of the three types that would live past death--- a 
dreamling he was--- this would be a permanent death. And a painful one 
at that as his lungs froze and his eyes rolled back as he died.

She was only focused on her pain, but later--- she cried for him.

Despite what he did to her she couldn&#146;t bring herself to hate him. She 
could only bring herself to hate the one person she had begun to hate 
since Sakura left her behind---- herself.

---before you make another single move.

That&#146;s when the woman in black came and took her away.

She doesn&#146;t remember anything else after that.

------

For the longest time the two held each other, Tomoyo crying as she was 
rocked in Sakura&#146;s arms.

It was then that Sakura had a confession to make herself.

She had returned home then to originally collect her things and move 
to Hong Kong. But that&#146;s when she heard that Tomoyo was in the 
hospital and rushed to her side.

Fuu told her about the rape, but not who did it. And, when Sakura saw 
Tomoyo hurt and vulnerable she wanted to cry--- that&#146;s when Tomoyo&#146;s 
last barrier broke and she told Sakura how she loved her.

Surprised, shocked, and uncertain she stood there, until at last she 
rushed into Tomoyo&#146;s arms and never left her side ever since. Tomoyo, 
confused, asked the question on her lips. &#147;Did you stay--- because 
you--- pitied me?&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t know why I wanted to stay--- until I realized that--- if 
given the chance--- maybe I could have fallen for you too. I was so 
preoccupied with Yuki and then Li I never saw you pining for me 
until--- goddess I almost lost you and then on I vowed I would never 
lose you again. Never.&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan---&#148; Tomoyo whispered, holding onto her as the two. She 
suddenly remembered something, and pulled herself away while exposing 
her breasts. &#147;Figure Eight.&#148;

&#147;Phwee?&#148;

&#147;Father--- I mean stepfather---&#148; Tomoyo began, her finger slowly 
etching out a figure eight on her chest, &#147;He told me one day he would 
be able to draw a figure eight on my mature breasts--- I guess you 
could now since I grew up and---&#148; (tears came to Tomoyo&#146;s cheeks) &#147;I&#146;m 
sorry! I don&#146;t even know why---&#148;

Sakura leans forward, traces an eight, and whispers into Tomoyo&#146;s ear. 
Her face faults as she listens, slowly however that shock slides into 
a comforting smile as she kisses Sakura on the lips.

The two hold that kiss for the longest time, slowly their strength 
fades as they fall into a deep restoring sleep. As sleep slowly 
overwhelms her, Tomoyo felt someone brush a hand through her hair and 
she looked up. The woman in black was standing near her.

Tomoyo smiled, reaching a hand up to touch the soft black of her 
clothing whispering the words &#147;Thank you.&#148; as she fell asleep in 
Sakura&#146;s loving arms.

For awhile the woman lingered, then stepped outside where she ran into 
Fuu and the others from the estates. &#147;Miss Tomoyo! Is she---?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s fine now.&#148; Keiko assured them, pushing past them to allow them 
a look into her room. &#147;She&#146;s sleeping now so don&#146;t disturb her.&#148;

Keiko touches the spot where Tomoyo touched her, and frowns.

------

Keiko&#146;s flashback

Pakt! Pakt! Pakt! Pakt!

Keiko&#146;s sword slams into the ice over and over again, until she could 
pull him out of the water.

He was gasping for breath, freezing, and half naked--- but alive.

As he laid on the ice, Keiko turns him onto all fours and shoved his 
face into the hard ice. &#147;WHY?!?&#148; she screamed. It had been only two 
minutes since she took Tomoyo to a nearby cop to be taken to the 
hospital (with instructions to call her the minute she arrived there 
safe and sound), but she knew the signs of rape. &#147;WHO ARE YOU?&#148;

&#147;My precious--- I can&#146;t--- I&#146;m sick--- my precious---&#148; he kept 
gasping, shuddering with each breath. For five minutes she yelled, and 
questioned him, relentlessly. Each time he only repeat the same things 
over and over again. &#147;I can&#146;t--- I&#146;m sick--- my precious---&#148;

Finally, she got a call from the hospital. He said that she was taken 
into the emergency room &#147;to be on the safe side&#148;, and she was 
muttering something about her father---

That&#146;s when realization hit Keiko square in the face. She turns 
quickly, her eyes settling in on the broken man beneath her, and her 
rage began to go out of control. Her breath became stronger and 
ragged, coming up in huffs of white smoke as she fumed. Her hands 
clenched and unclenched, barely able to put her own phone away as she 
stared at him with a vicious hatred. For one brief moment a thought 
occurred to her.

But he broke her thought by whispering, &#147;I made my precious--- a 
woman---&#148;

With a scream of white hot anger, Keiko slams her foot down into his 
head, the impact is so hard it breaks the surface of the ice sending 
cracks across the once unmarred mirror like sheet.

She then pulls her sword free of it&#146;s sheathe and begins hacking into 
him with a vengeance.

------

Keiko snaps out of her memories as she reaches a dead end. She stares 
out windows looking out over a small garden in the hospital and 
watched as two people (a man and a woman) cuddled beneath one of the 
trees. She was obviously a patient but they didn&#146;t mind the nippy 
weather as long as they were together.

With that Keiko takes a deep breath and blows against the window, 
fogging it abit. With one finger she traces a sideways figure eight, 
and walks away, leaving the two outside their privacy.

------

Tomoyo briefly wakes up. It was now night, and Sakura had not left her 
side.

The hospital had rules against someone staying overnight, but no one 
in the hospital wanted to contradict Keiko&#146;s orders to let Sakura 
stay--- they were afraid of her--- so Sakura stayed. They even brought 
up two meals for them.

Tomorrow she&#146;d go home with Sakura, but for now--- she smiles as she 
traces the same figure on her chest but remembering not his words--- 
but Sakura&#146;s.

As she laid down again she felt her fears slipping away, like shadows 
fading in the rising sunlight.

They would never completely go away. That much she knew.

But as long as Sakura was with her--- she need not fear them--- never 
again.

&#147;I&#146;ll be with you forever---&#148; Sakura whispered, tracing the sign one 
more time on Tomoyo&#146;s chest, and then on her own. &#147;You. Me. Together. 
Forever.&#148;

Tomoyo fell asleep, and had nothing but peaceful thoughts from that 
moment forward.

------

Figure Eight as half of four.

Figure Four as half of eight.

If you skate it would be great if you could make--- a figure eight.

That&#146;s a circle that turns &#145;round about itself---

Place it on it&#146;s side and it&#146;s a symbol meaning--- infinity---
