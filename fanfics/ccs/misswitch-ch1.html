<h1>Miss Witch (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/forever3330.html">Forever3330</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	The Narrator, who makes her rare appearance now, appears out of 
thin air. She seems to be just above five feet, but around the age of 
thirteen. She has short chestnut brown hair that is pulled back in a 
pony, and matching deep brown eyes. She adjusts her wire-rim-glasses, 
and dusts off her dress. &#147;Ahem. Ohayo!&#148; The Narrator smiles brightly. 
&#147;My name is Megumi! This is my part in the story, though I may have 
one more at the end. If the author let&#146;s me. Wah! I never show up!&#148; Is 
thwacked on the head with a sign that says &#145;get on with it!&#146;, which 
had fallen from above her head. &#147;Daijoubu, daijoubu!&#148; Megumi clears 
her throat, and the air around her turns black, the only light 
seemingly coming from her. &#147;There are many different paths that our 
world could have taken. This story is set in one of them. I have come 
to tell you of a world where magic is common; ordinary. It is what 
runs our world&#133;Those who are gifted with it are important. Very few 
are gifted with this strange power, and there are many different 
kinds. Keep in mind, that in this world, Clow Reed was not the first 
owner of the cards&#133;they have existed since the beginning of time. A 
century from his death, today, there is great commotion going on in a 
meeting of all the witches; Ieran-sama, head of the Witches&#146; Council, 
has called a meeting. A century after every death of a card owner, a 
new one will have been found. The new mistress was found late, her 
awakening beginning before the Witches&#146; Council could find her. There 
is chaos everywhere in the Council! There is always only one card 
owner; that person is the most powerful magic user known to the 
Witches&#146; Council. Unfortunately, only the Witches&#146; Council knows of 
this. Not ever the card owner knows it sometimes. Now the user&#146;s 
Guardian Witch must be selected (either male or female), using the 
powers of all the Council, which consists of twelve witches, the most 
powerful alive. There is one exception to that, but that comes later. 
Please, come and see the meeting yourself.&#148; Megumi smiles and waves 
two fingers, disappearing with a wink, as the nothingness behind where 
she used to be starts to take form&#133;

	A lavender haired young witch sits down carefully in the section 
where most of the Daidouji clan is sitting. Well, there are only two 
of them, but all of their servants and guards sit with them.
	&#147;Okaa-san, this is so exciting!&#148; Tomoyo smiles, speaking as she 
usually did, in a way that made Sonomi smile. Her daughter seemed to 
give each word thought before speaking, her melodious voice rarely 
heard at times. &#147;Miyaki-san told me that one of the Li clan is most 
likely to be chosen. It&#146;s too bad that others might not be, but she 
says the Li clan has the most powerful magic, descended from the last 
card user, Clow.&#148; Tomoyo tilts her head to the side, looking over at 
Miyaki, their cook. She turns back to Sonomi, and claps her hands 
together before setting them in her lap.
	 Sonomi frowns. &#147;I guess they always get the Guardian Witch 
position, don&#146;t they?&#148; She looks at her fourteen-year-old daughter. 
&#147;Agh! I want justice for once!&#148; A few members of different clans look 
over with sweatdrop, but everyone around Sonomi simply smiles or 
sighs, used to her outbursts.
	&#147;Okaa-san, you always could have your justice. You ARE one of 
the most powerful Witches, but you demanded to get off the council a 
few years after I was born. When I was around three?&#148; Tomoyo smiled 
gently.
	Sonomi frowned, thinking.
	&#147;Oh, look Miss, it&#146;s starting!&#148; The head maid exclaimed, 
pointing up at the woman who was standing at the floating white disk, 
a platform.
	&#147;Oh, goody!&#148; Tomoyo said, tugging Sonomi&#146;s sleeve to get her 
attention and point it out.
	&#147;Thank you to all who have gathered here today.&#148; Ieran-sama 
started. &#147;As you know, we have chosen a new Guardian Witch, with our 
powers. The one chosen was a surprise for us all.&#148;
	&#147;Yeah, right&#133;&#148; Sonomi muttered darkly.
	Tomoyo giggled, then looked thoughtfully at the Li clan.
	Ieran looked straight at Sonomi with a smile. &#147;Ah, Daidouji-san. 
It is good to see you again&#133;though we had to blackmail, bribe, and 
force you to be here with us.&#148; The woman smiled as Sonomi blushed, 
muttering, and others laughed. &#147;As you all know, we first chose the 
five best witches, be they male or female, and then one from that 
group, the best one. &#145;Best&#146; does not always mean the most powerful, 
the brainiest, the most popular. Here &#145;best&#146; means being the perfect 
Guardian Witch, able to help train and guide your card-user through 
all obstacles. Of course, this is the greatest honor anyone could ever 
imagine. Though the four not picked will not become the Guardian 
Witch, they will go out to seek their fortunes, and we will bless 
them. Daidouji-san, since you are well versed on the subject, please 
come and speak.&#148;
	Most people gasped as Sonomi was asked to speak. She seemed to 
hate attention, content with never using her powers, working as a 
simple toy designer. Gracefully, Sonomi floated up on a platform of 
her own, waving a hand to dim the lighting magically, and focus it on 
her. &#147;First, before I start, I&#146;d like to say one thing; Ieran-sama, 
watch your back. You may die soon&#133;&#148; A few people laugh nervously. 
Ieran simply smiles, as Sonomi smiles back. &#147;She is correct though. I 
spent most of my past life learning about Guardian Witches. This will 
be as short as possible. Live with it.&#148; Mutters in the crowd. 
&#147;Guardian Witch is a honored position, as there is only one for each 
of the five first witches. Each Council chooses one witch, and that 
witch will Guard whomever their predecessor had Guarded. For the 
Council of Five Moons, that person is the card-user. The other four 
magic-user spots are very powerful, but filled in different ways. When 
you become a Guardian Witch you will have a powerful influence on some 
decisions made, as you will be the ultimate authority on your 
magic-user, in our case, the card-user. Your magic will become 
stronger, as will the magic-user&#146;s. You must be prepared to do 
anything they need you to during battle. You must be everything they 
need. First, of course, you must find the magic-user. We only know the 
general area they are in, and when they begin their course as a 
magic-user. That&#146;s all I&#146;m going to say. Learn everything else by 
yourself. I hate talking at these things&#133;&#148; Sonomi continued muttering 
until she reached her seat.
	Ieran-sama smiled. &#147;Thank you Daidouji-san. Now, to name the 
four whom shall be blessed to leave and find their fortune.&#148; The woman 
sweatdropped. &#147;Uh&#133;Kaho-san, you have been chosen to go for the fifth 
time.&#148;
	Kaho was at least five thousand years old. She stood, smiled and 
bowed.
	&#147;Next is Harunoh Hoshi.&#148;
	Tomoyo turned her head, identifying the girl as one of her 
classmates from the private school she attended. Tomoyo smiled 
cheerfully, wishing Hoshi good luck in her thoughts, sending a spell 
for luck in her direction.
	&#147;Then we have Li Yurihito.&#148; Ieran-sama smiled as cheers were 
heard from her Clan&#146;s section, and mutters from a few others.
	&#147;Ah! A new clan has come very close to winning the position.&#148; 
Everyone sat up straighter in anticipation. &#147;Mihao Suzuka!&#148; Ieran-sama 
smiled slightly, but it was gone in an instant.
	There was chaos of noise for a few moments, but then Ieran-sama 
raised her hand, signaling for silence. &#147;The new Guardian Witch is 
Daidouji Tomoyo. Congratulations.&#148;
	Tomoyo sat there smiling, unable to take that in. She listened 
to the whispers of &#145;who?&#146; and &#145;not a Li?&#146; silently, barely noticing 
her Mother&#146;s own shocked expression.
	&#147;What&#133;but&#133;&#148; Sonomi tried.
	Tomoyo jumped up and clapped her hands together, then flung them 
around Sonomi&#146;s neck. &#147;Okaa-san! Did you hear that?!&#148;
	Ieran-sama sighed. &#147;Sonomi-san, dear, do try to let go of your 
daughter. She has to get ready to meet her new charge!&#148;
