<pre>Hi!!!! Christmas is approaching and I want to give a present to the
Tomoyo x Sakura fans. This story is my gift to all of you whom
like/love this beautiful couple. I hope that you will like it I will
see you at the end of the story.

*******

&quot;Wow!! It&#39;s snowing!!!&quot; Sakura said happily as she saw the snow falling
over Tomoeda.

&quot;Of course, Sakura-chan. Christmas is approaching,&quot; Tomoyo said smiling
to her.

&quot;What will you do for Christmas, Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura asked to her best
friend.

&quot;I don&#39;t know yet. Maybe I will stay in my house,&quot; Tomoyo said to her.

&quot;But your mother is on a business trip, you will be alone for
Christmas. Do you want this?&quot; Sakura asked sadly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Sakura-chan. Before meeting you, I had many Christmas&#39;
alone so I&#39;m accustomed to it,&quot; Tomoyo said smiling to her.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t want my best friend having a lonely Christmas. You will
stay with me on Christmas, okay?&quot; Sakura said taking Tomoyo&#39;s hand into
her own.

&quot;Are you sure? I don&#39;t want to be a bother to you&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;No, you aren&#39;t a bother. You&#39;re my friend, I want you with me on
Christmas. I will call you later, all right?&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Yes&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;I will see you later, Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Sakura-chan...&quot; Tomoyo said

&quot;What Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura asked smiling.

&quot;Thank you...&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to thank me, Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura said and left.

As Sakura was out of sight, Tomoyo laid a hand over her heart.

&quot;I love you, Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo whispered and headed to her home.

**********

Tomoyo was in her house looking for something that she could give to
Sakura.

&quot;I wish to give Sakura-chan a greatest Christmas present&quot; Tomoyo said
excited.

Suddenly the phone rang and Tomoyo picked it up.

&quot;Hello, Tomoyo speaking&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;Hi, Tomoyo.&quot;

&quot;Hi, mother!!&quot; Tomoyo said happily.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but the meeting is harder, so I don&#39;t know if I will be
with you for Christmas&quot; Sonomi said sadly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry mom, Sakura-chan invited me to her house for Christmas,&quot;
Tomoyo said happily.

&quot;Really!? I&#39;m so glad. I just hope that you will enjoy it&quot; Sonomi said
excited.

&quot;I&#39;m sure that I will enjoy it&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;Well, I will call you later. Ah, Tomoyo one thing...&quot; Sonomi said.

&quot;What, mom?&quot;

&quot;Maybe on Christmas your wish will come true&quot; Sonomi said.

&quot;Mother...&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;I must go now, I will call you later Tomoyo. Bye,&quot; Sonomi said.

&quot;Bye, mom&quot; Tomoyo said and hung up the phone.

Tomoyo looked to the box that was under the influence of the Shield
card, she opened it and looked to the eraser that Sakura gave her.

&quot;She gave me this eraser, it&#39;s the first thing she gave to me. She
changed my life, I never felt alone after met her. She is.... she is...
like an angel that filled my heart with joy. How many times I wished to
make her happy? Many times. I would like to hear her saying &#39;I love
you, Tomoyo-chan&#39; but can be possible? Could she love me as I love her?
In that way?&quot; Tomoyo said as she was looking to the eraser.

&quot;Can my wish be fulfilled?&quot; Tomoyo whispered.

*****

Sakura was busy looking to the Christmas tree.

&quot;Hoe. I think that needs a more decoration... and better&quot; Sakura said.

She looked for the Christmas decorations. After a while of looking she
accepted defeat.

&quot;Hoeeee!! There&#39;s nothing to make the tree a little better!&quot; Sakura
exclaimed.

&quot;Why are you so angry, kaijuu?&quot; Touya said.

&quot;I&#39;m not a kaijuu and I&#39;m angry because there is no good decorations
for the tree&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Maybe, why you don&#39;t go shopping?&quot; Touya asked.

&quot;Good idea, but I don&#39;t have much money and besides I must buy Tomoyo&#39;s
gift&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Why not ask dad?. I&#39;m sure he will lend you some money&quot; Touya said.

&quot;But dad is out of the town because of his work. Do you know when he
will come back?&quot; Sakura asked worried.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Today is December 23rd and he didn&#39;t call yet.&quot; Touya
said.

&quot;Great. And you don&#39;t have some money?. I will pay you later, I
promise.&quot; Sakura pleaded to her brother.

&quot;Why must I give money to a kaijuu?&quot; Touya said joking.

&quot;Onii-chan.....&quot; Sakura was losing her temper.

&quot;Okay, I will. But I don&#39;t promise nothing. I must buy a gift for
Yukito.&quot; Touya said.

&quot;Thanks!!!&quot; Sakura said happily.

Sakura went to her room and looked for her money box and checked.

&quot;I have some money but I would like to have a little more.&quot; Sakura
whispered.

Touya entered to her room.

&quot;Well, I checked my money box. Here, there&#39;s some money you can have,
but don&#39;t spend all,&quot; Touya said as he gave money to Sakura.

&quot;Thanks, onii-chan!!!&quot; Sakura said happily.

Sakura received the money.

&quot;Well, I must go to buy Yukito&#39;s gift. If you will go shopping do it
now, the snowfall will be getting worse according to the news&quot; Touya
said.

&quot;Sure, I will go after I get ready&quot; Sakura said.

Touya left the room and Sakura went to her dresser and looked for her
coat.

&quot;Why do you need more money? It&#39;s enough with what you have&quot; Kero-chan
said.

&quot;I know that, but I&#39;m sure that Tomoyo-chan will give me a greatest
gift because she is rich&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Maybe, but Tomoyo must think that your gift is that you invited her to
the house&quot; Kero-chan said.

&quot;Do you think that?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;Yes&quot; Kero-chan said.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll see you later, bye!&quot; Sakura said as she left her room.

******

Tomoyo was in one of the malls of Tomoeda. She was looking a gift for
Sakura, behind of her were her bodyguards.

She looked through the stores but she didn&#39;t find anything.

Suddenly a thought hit her.

&quot;I know what I can give to Sakura-chan&quot; she thought.

She entered to the store, she bought the gift and left the store.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m ready&quot; she said to the bodyguards and them left.

*******

Sakura entered to the mall and looked for a gift.

&quot;Will I find a gift for her?&quot; Sakura thought to herself.

After a while, she bought the decorations for the tree but she didn&#39;t
found a gift for Tomoyo.

&quot;Hoe, I didn&#39;t find anything for her. I would like to give her
something special, but what? I want to give her two gifts, I have one
already but I need the other&quot; Sakura whispered.

She looked the mall one more time and suddenly she looked to one store
and found something interesting.

&quot;I will buy it&quot; Sakura said.

She bought the gift and left the mall.

********

At the next day...

Tomoyo was wrapping the gift for Sakura.

&quot;It&#39;s done, I&#39;m sure that Sakura-chan will like it&quot; Tomoyo said
smiling.

She looked through the window.

&quot;It seems the snowfall will be worse&quot; Tomoyo thought.

She picked the telephone and dialed Sakura&#39;s number.

&quot;Hello, Sakura speaking&quot;

&quot;Sakura-chan?&quot;

&quot;Tomoyo-chan! How are you?&quot; Sakura said happily.

&quot;I&#39;m fine. Thank you&quot;

&quot;Can you come to my house right now?. The news said the snowfall will
get worse&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Sure! I&#39;ll be right there&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;I&#39;ll wait for you&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Bye, Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;Bye, Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura said and Tomoyo hung the phone.

Tomoyo picked up the gift and left the room.

******

Sakura was alone in the house, her brother went to Yukito&#39;s house to
give the gift. She looked at the clock, she was nervous.

&quot;Please, come Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura whispered.

The time seemed eternal for Sakura, she looked through the window, the
snowfall was getting worse.

Suddenly the phone rang. Sakura rushed to pick it.

&quot;Hello, Sakura speaking&quot;

&quot;Hi, Kaijuu&quot; Touya said.

&quot;Onii-chan...&quot; Sakura said losing her temper.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t go to home. The road is blocked by the snow and
Yukito asked me if I could stay with him because he is alone as well.
Do you mind?&quot; he said to Sakura.

&quot;No. I don&#39;t.&quot; Sakura said

&quot;Thanks, kaijuu&quot; Touya said.

&quot;I&#39;m not a kaijuu!!!&quot; Sakura screamed.

Suddenly she heard the bell of the door.

&quot;It&#39;s must be Tomoyo-chan!!&quot; Sakura said happily.

She went to the door and opened it.

Tomoyo stood there with a coat and a scarf. She was holding Sakura&#39;s
gift in her hands.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan! Please come in&quot; Sakura said and let Tomoyo in.

&quot;Thanks, Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

&quot;Let me take your coat and scarf. I will make something hot for you,
you&#39;re cold&quot; Sakura said as she grabbed the coat and scarf.

&quot;Okay&quot; Tomoyo said.

Tomoyo looked to the tree, it was incomplete.

Sakura went with a cup of hot tea.

&quot;You can drink this. It will make you better&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Thanks, Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said as she took the cup.

Tomoyo drank the tea and felt her body warming up.

&quot;Are you feeling better?&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;Yes, thanks Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

&quot;Can you help me to decorate the tree?&quot; Sakura asked

&quot;Yes&quot; Tomoyo said.

Both girls went to the tree and placed the decorations. After a time
they completed with the decoration.

&quot;Now, it&#39;s beautiful.&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;Yes, now the tree is beautiful.&quot; Tomoyo said smiling as well.

&quot;What can we do now? There&#39;s still time before Christmas&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I could make the food for the dinner.&quot; Tomoyo suggested

&quot;It&#39;s not necessary. I did the food but I don&#39;t know what to do now.
We&#39;re alone and my father will not come to house&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Really?&quot; Tomoyo asked.

&quot;Yes&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;We could sleep&quot; Tomoyo suggested.

&quot;Are you tired Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;Could be&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;Let&#39;s sleep then&quot; Sakura said and went to her room to pick a blanket,
a pillow and Tomoyo&#39;s gift.

When Sakura appeared in the main hall, she looked to Tomoyo. Tomoyo was
placing her gift under the tree.

Without saying a word Sakura placed her gift as well.

&quot;Let&#39;s go to sleep Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura said.

Sakura placed the pillow on the couch.

&quot;Come on, Tomoyo-chan. This blanket will cover us,&quot; Sakura said as both
girls went to the couch. Tomoyo was the first to sleep. Sakura smiled
and stroked Tomoyo&#39;s hair.

&quot;She is always smiling. Even sleeping&quot; Sakura thought to herself.

She took Tomoyo in her arms and fell to sleep.

*******

Tomoyo woke up in Sakura&#39;s arms and blushed furiously.

&quot;She is embracing me. I&#39;m feeling her arms around me. But she is
embracing me because I&#39;m her friend.&quot; Tomoyo thought sadly.

&quot;Did you sleep well?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;Yes, I did. I was tired because I was doing your gift&quot; Tomoyo said to
Sakura.

Sakura smiled.

&quot;I&#39;m hungry, let&#39;s go to eat Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura suggested.

Both girls went to eat the food that Sakura made. After that Tomoyo
started to clean up the dishes.

&quot;It&#39;s not necessary Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Sakura-chan. I wanted to help you&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll help you.&quot; Sakura said and both girls finished the cleaning
of the dishes.

After that both girls sat down looking to the tree.

&quot;Your brother isn&#39;t coming Sakura-chan?&quot; Tomoyo asked.

&quot;No, he&#39;s at Yukito&#39;s place&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;And your father?&quot; Tomoyo asked again.

&quot;He will not come, he will pass Christmas with a friend of his&quot; Sakura
said.

&quot;Then we&#39;re alone&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;Yes, but I don&#39;t mind. You&#39;re with me and I&#39;m sure this Christmas will
be special&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;Yes, it will be special&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;Your mother was with you for the past Christmas?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;Yes, the Christmas that I had before she was with me. I said that I
was alone because I wanted a friend with me. My father rarely came to
see me on Christmas, he is busy all the time&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for asking you. I didn&#39;t know it&quot; Sakura said sadly.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m so glad that you invited me for Christmas&quot; Tomoyo said.

Suddenly Kero-chan appeared out of nowhere and shouted.

&quot;IT&#39;S ALMOST MIDNIGHT!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Hoe!!!!! Kero-chan don&#39;t scare us this way!!!!&quot; Sakura screamed to
him.

&quot;I want the cake!!&quot; Kero-chan retorted.

&quot;You will have your cake, but let me give Tomoyo-chan my gift, first&quot;
Sakura said.

Tomoyo smiled at the two.

The phone rang and Sakura picked it.

&quot;Hello, Sakura speaking&quot;

&quot;Hi, Sakura-chan&quot;

&quot;Yukito-san! How are you? Merry Christmas!!&quot; Sakura said happily.

&quot;Merry Christmas to you and Tomoyo-chan&quot; Yukito said.

&quot;Did you know Tomoyo-chan is with me?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;Yes, Touya told me.&quot;

&quot;Onii-chan is with you? I want to tell him Merry Christmas&quot; Sakura
said.

&quot;Of course, I will pass the phone to him&quot; Yukito said and Touya picked
the phone.

&quot;Merry Christmas, Sakura&quot;

&quot;Merry Christmas, onii-chan&quot;

&quot;Say Merry Christmas to Tomoyo-san&quot; Touya said.

&quot;Yes, I will&quot; Sakura said happily.

&quot;I must go, Merry Christmas kaijuu&quot; Touya said and hung up the phone.

&quot;I&#39;m not a kaijuu!!!!&quot; Sakura screamed again.

Sakura hung up the phone and Kero-chan was almost crying.

&quot;What&#39;s happen Kero-chan?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;It&#39;s midnight and you haven&#39;t given me MY CAKE!!&quot; Kero-chan said
crying.

&quot;Okay, okay, I will do it&quot; Sakura said.

Sakura went to the kitchen and pulled the cake out of the refrigerator.

&quot;Here&#39;s your cake. Merry Christmas Kero-chan&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;Waiii. Thanks and Merry Christmas Sakura and Tomoyo&quot; Kero-chan said as
he grabbed the cake.

&quot;Thanks Kero-chan. Merry Christmas to you&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

Kero-chan left the main hall and went to Sakura&#39;s room to eat his cake.

&quot;Kero-chan don&#39;t mess up my room!!!&quot; Sakura shouted to him.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot; Kero-chan said to her.

After he left Sakura turned to Tomoyo.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Tomoyo-chan, but he wanted his cake&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

Sakura smiled to her.

&quot;Merry Christmas Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

&quot;Merry Christmas Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said while still smiling.

Both girls went to the tree and grabbed their gifts.

&quot;It&#39;s for you, Merry Christmas Sakura-chan.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura said as she received the gift.

&quot;I just hope that you like it&quot; Tomoyo said nervously.

Sakura unwrapped the gift and she was surprised. It was a bear holding
a picture of Tomoyo and Sakura smiling.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful&quot; Sakura said happily.

&quot;I know this gift isn&#39;t expensive. But I bought the materials and I did
by myself. You had given me a lot and I know that I will never be able
to pay what you did for me. This bear expresses what you mean to me.
You gave me a beautiful Christmas&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

Sakura smiled with tears.

She grabbed Tomoyo&#39;s gift.

&quot;It&#39;s for you, Merry Christmas Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura said as she wiped
her tears.

Tomoyo received the gift and unwrapped it. It was an doll. It was an
angel doll.

&quot;It&#39;s not expensive as well. And this doll is my gift to you, you mean
so much to me,&quot; Sakura said smiling.

Tomoyo&#39;s tears ran freely through her cheeks.

&quot;It&#39;s a beautiful gift. Thanks Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said crying.

Sakura embraced Tomoyo.

&quot;I have one more gift for you Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Another one Sakura-chan?&quot; Tomoyo said as she stopped crying.

&quot;Yes, this one is more special&quot; Sakura said as she led herself and
Tomoyo under a mistletoe.

Sakura take hold Tomoyo&#39;s hand.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan, I will tell you the real reason why I invited you to my
home. You were there when I needed something, anything. But I wanted to
tell you that finally I found out the real meaning of your words... of
what you were going to tell me when we would be older. I looked into my
heart and I found that I felt the same as you. I&#39;m in love with you,
you filled the void that existed in my heart. You&#39;re an angel like the
doll... the most beautiful angel that I had ever known. I love you
Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura finished her confession and looked to Tomoyo.

Tomoyo&#39;s eyes were open wide, she hardly believed what Sakura said. Her
deepest wish was fulfilled, Sakura was in love with her. Once again
tears ran freely through her cheeks.

&quot;I love you Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said crying.

Sakura came closer and kissed Tomoyo softly on the lips. Tomoyo closed
her eyes as she felt Sakura&#39;s kiss.

After a long time they broke the kiss.

&quot;I really love you Tomoyo-chan. I want you kiss me because we&#39;re under
the mistletoe&quot; Sakura said smiling.

Tomoyo blushed.

&quot;You gave me my first kiss. I will make you happy,&quot; Tomoyo said as she
kissed Sakura.

After that the two embraced tightly.

&quot;My confession is my second gift to you. You will never pass a lonely
Christmas anymore. You will never be alone nevermore. I will be with
you forever&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;You gave me the most beautiful gift that I never had&quot; Tomoyo said.

&quot;Do you want to be my girlfriend, Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;Yes, I want to.&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

Both girls kissed each other again. After that the phone rang and
Sakura and picked up.

&quot;Hello, Sakura speaking&quot;

&quot;Merry Christmas my daughter&quot; Fujitaka said.

&quot;Merry Christmas father!!!&quot; Sakura said happily.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for not be with you, I just hope that you&#39;re not alone&quot;
Fujitaka said to her.

&quot;No, I&#39;m not alone, Tomoyo-chan is with me&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;I&#39;m glad. Please say Merry Christmas to Tomoyo-san for me please?&quot;

&quot;Of course I will, dad&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;I must go now. I will be there when the road is not blocked. Bye and
Merry Christmas Sakura&quot; Fujitaka said.

&quot;Merry Christmas to you father&quot; Sakura said hanging the phone up.

&quot;My father and brother wish you a Merry Christmas Tomoyo-chan&quot; Sakura
said as she turned to Tomoyo.

&quot;Thanks&quot; Tomoyo said smiling.

&quot;I&#39;m tired Tomoyo-chan. Can we go to sleep?&quot; Sakura asked smiling.

&quot;Of course, Sakura-chan&quot; Tomoyo said and both went to the couch. Tomoyo
pulled the blanket covering both of them.

&quot;Merry Christmas, Tomoyo-chan and I love you&quot; Sakura said as she was
holding Tomoyo in her arms

&quot;Merry Christmas, Sakura-chan and I love you too&quot; Tomoyo said as she
kissed Sakura.

After a time both girls were sleeping with a smile in their faces and
holding each other.

******

Some notes:

1&ordm; Both girls are 10 years old.

Well, finally I did this story and I wanted to make a sweet Christmas
fic and of course love fic between Tomoyo and Sakura. I think that I
made it very mushy. I really love write about them.

I wish all of you a very special Christmas and a happy new year.

Merry Christmas to all of you!!!!
