<h1>Remastered IV (part 3 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster4-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>New King Penguin Park looked a tad errie at night. With the lights 
turned down dim, and the sky only illuminated by the presence of the 
Central Hub above, the park seemed quite errie.

It was in this setting that everyone was out searching for the Dash 
card.

True, it was spotted earlier by Sakura, but it managed to get onto the 
back of a truck and vanish into traffic earlier. It took awhile, but 
Sakura managed to locate it again. First thing she wanted to do was 
call Li, which was the last thing Nina wanted. She called, but he 
didn&#146;t reply.

&#147;Must be out.&#148; she replied, closing the new cell phone she got from 
Tomoyo.

That, however, was only half right.

While Li was indeed in his apartment, he was for all intents and 
purposes &#147;out&#148;. He had taken sleeping pills, seeking solace and 
comfort in the arms of the Eliza in his dreams if he couldn&#146;t be with 
her in reality.

So he was not present for this card hunt, and Nina, Keiko and Rena 
couldn&#146;t have been happier.

As they spread out along the woods, trying to flush Dash out, Keiko 
had a weird notion, &#147;Why don&#146;t we just lob stun grenades into the 
woods and pick up the &#147;pieces&#148; after it gets knocked around a few 
times?&#148;

&#147;No! Don&#146;t hurt Dash!&#148; Sakura cried out, Tomoyo nearby filming her 
(and also there to support her and back her up). At this Keiko sighed 
and went back to looking through the brush, &#147;Yeah, yeah, whatever. 
I--&#148; (stops) &#147;--anyone else hear that noise?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s Dash.&#148; Nina whispers, kneeling down as she draws her Globtek 
pulse pistol out and sets it to a low setting. &#147;Low stun. Not enough 
to put to sleep, but enough to slow and weaken it.&#148;

Sakura nods her head as she moves forward, staff in hand, &#147;Nobody hurt 
Dash, it&#146;s---&#148;

Suddenly the card comes flying out of the brush and right towards 
Keiko/Rena. Confused, the two try to tackle it only to collide with 
each other as it slides between them. Sakura quickly reaches her left 
hand out and brings her focus onto her Windy Ring.,&#147;Windy!&#148; she cries 
out, &#147;Form a sphere of restraint around Dash, but don&#146;t hurt it!&#148;

Windy&#146;s power whips forward trying to reach Dash, but it manages to 
keep ahead of the ring&#146;s effect jumping upwards into the tree branches 
flying over tree after tree taking the overland route to escape. 
&#147;We&#146;ve got ourselves a &#147;flyer&#148; here!&#148; Nina yells out, tapping her 
commlink, &#147;Dash is coming your way through the treetops! Can you nab 
it?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll try.&#148; the voice on the opposite end replies, Nina going into a 
full sprint to keep up with the others as they all followed Dash. Over 
her commlink she could hear Eliza speaking, &#147;Ribbon Trap&#148; she called 
out as she triggered a spell. Silence, then the sound of struggling 
and the bending of tree limbs. &#147;Stop! Don&#146;t fight the spell! Stop it! 
St---&#148; (something ahead snaps) &#147;NO!!&#148;

&#147;Dash!!&#148; Sakura cries, her legs pumping faster and faster as she 
rushes right up to Eliza, her face concerned. &#147;Dash broke loose.&#148; 
Sakura looks about, raising her staff as she does, &#147;Dash! Don&#146;t run! 
We only want to help you!&#148;

Silence. Then, suddenly, a noise off to one side. Sakura and Eliza 
turn to see Dash, floating in midair frozen in place, and guiding 
him-- &#147;Catherine?&#148;

Sakura came into the clearing looking at her rather confused, &#147;But 
how? How did? I mean -- uh -- thanks.&#148;

&#147;No problem.&#148; Catherine Picadello smiles, watching as Sakura takes the 
paralyzed Dash into her arms to comfort it. At first it doesn&#146;t want 
to be in her grasp, it&#146;s eyes wild as if looking to escape. However, 
once it calms down it begins to settle down, Catherine removes the 
paralysis to allow it to move on it&#146;s own. The first thing it does is 
nuzzle Sakura&#146;s face and lick her cheek. She giggles and fidgets under 
Dash&#146;s &#147;affections&#148; as Tomoyo tapes it on her camera for posterity. 
&#147;Think Dash missed you, Sakura-chan!&#147;

&#147;Ok. Ok. I missed you too! Come on!! Hey!!&#147; she squirmed, Dash&#146;s 
tongue tickling her face. Finally Catherine motions for Dash, holding 
an arm out for Dash to land on. &#147;If you will do the honors?&#148;

&#147;Oh! Right! Ahem --&#148; (holds staff out) &#147;-- Clow Card return to your 
powers confined, DASH CARD!!&#148; she yells, slamming the staff down and 
unleashing a dozen strands of energy that pick Dash up and convert it 
back into card form. The card jumps briefly into the air, and lands in 
Sakura&#146;s hand.

As everyone gathers around to look at the card, Catherine glances 
sideways at Tomoyo and sighs.

&#147;I&#146;m happy just being close to her. I&#146;m happy just being close to 
her.&#148; she sighed, her memory of the capture still fresh in her mind&#146;s 
eye after an hour.

Crystallia (the Dream Continent of Antarctica)

The Winterian City of Icskellius (Ick-shell-ius)

She sat in her office overlooking the cold steel buildings of the 
Winterian city just outside, her office being at the top of a long 
tower located near the center of the city of metal and steel. This 
tower, rising above the other buildings, gave her office a commanding 
view of both the city itself and the surrounding snow and ice. She had 
been &#147;commuting&#148; back and forth from Tokyo to here ever since she 
brought her first &#147;candidate&#148; for her excursion plans, but she&#146;s also 
been very careful to keep her activities low key and under the radar 
while she was doing her present &#147;tasks&#148;. However it seemed she wasn&#146;t 
far enough below the radar, seeing as how she was working only to have 
the commsystem beep. &#147;If it&#146;s not one thing -- yes?&#148;

&#147;Call for you from a Captain Lazarus.&#148;

She sighed, leaning back in her chair, &#147;Dammit.&#148; she growled. She knew 
why he was calling, and she wished he wasn&#146;t calling if it was all the 
same to her. &#147;When it rains--&#148;

-----

Speaking of rain-- (back in Tokyo)

As soon as they returned to the Daidouji Estates it started to rain.

Low key and quietly at first, but then it began to grow, and grow. 
Presently it was raining rather fiercely outside, but that made 
staying inside in a nice warm bed that much more appealing.

Tomoyo shivered beneath Sakura&#146;s loving touch, the young woman&#146;s 
fingers gently digging into her shoulders giving her a perfect 
massage. She was glad that they caught Dash when they did, and wasn&#146;t 
caught out in the rain while looking for the card. &#147;I barely did 
anything today.&#148; Tomoyo sighed, looking up at Sakura as she did, &#147;You 
did all the work.&#148;

&#147;But you were so helpful, and I couldn&#146;t have done it without you -- 
sometimes I wonder how I can get through each day if I didn&#146;t have you 
--&#148;

&#147;Thanks.&#148; Tomoyo smiled, sinking her head back into her pillow, 
&#147;You&#146;re sweet.&#148;

As Sakura continued to work her &#147;magic&#148;, Tomoyo&#146;s mind began to drift 
and she thought of all the times Sakura was there for her. &#147;I want to 
be there for you, Sakura-chan. Whenever you need me.&#148; she whispers, 
bringing a smile to Sakura&#146;s face. &#147;Tomo-chan.&#148;

In awhile Tomoyo would switch places with Sakura, and return the 
favor. But that was in awhile. For now she simply laid there, and 
relished the attention her Sakura-chan paid to her.

The GameBoy Advance seemed a little bit more useful now, Kero thought, 
as he continued to rearrange his deck for another duel. The rain and 
occasional lightning noises scared Cloud, even though their &#147;room&#148; had 
no windows (though was also well vented and the air was fresh and 
clean) and was nowhere near the rain outside. Cloud wanted to crawl 
beneath the sheets, but she didn&#146;t want to be bored while hiding, so 
she was playing GameBoy Advance games with Kero to pass the time away. 
Still, a majority of her body was safely hidden beneath her blankets 
with Kero also in her bed (on top of the sheets with his own little 
blankets covering him as he dueled with Cloud).

&#147;Are you ready yet?&#148; she growled, looking rather bored as she waited. 
&#147;In a second, in a second!&#148; he growled back, working to finish his 
deck. &#147;There. Now I&#146;m ready to beat you.&#148;

&#147;Doubt it!&#148; she cheered, loosening up as Kero got ready, &#147;I&#146;m going to 
beat you again!&#148;

&#147;Hmph.&#148; he huffed his breath, focused --- but then --- &#147;What do you 
think of that Syaoran brat?&#148;

&#147;Too immature for my tastes. I like my men big yet sensitive, tough 
yet caring, and has a taste for the finer things in life -- and when I 
find a man like that I&#146;ll let you know!&#148; (phht!)

Kero played his first card, glaring over at Cloud as he did. She 
merely smiled and played a card, &#147;Oh don&#146;t pout at me! You know you&#146;re 
the only one for me.&#148;

Kero&#146;s features softened, and he played another card.

She&#146;d change her mind, of course, the minute she started losing, but 
he knew that she cared for him.

From beneath the blankets Cloud looked about the room and sighed, &#147;I 
wish this house had room service. (too cold to even think of going to 
the kitchen!)&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not that cold.&#148;

&#147;Then YOU go!&#148; Cloud countered, to which Kero shook his head and 
muttered, &#147;Too cold.&#148;

Meanwhile--- (Icskellius)

Her finger punches down on the button as she leans back, the link 
establishing almost immediately. &#147;To what do I have this &#147;pleasure&#148; of 
your company?&#148;

Jack didn&#146;t look the slightest big pleased, in fact he looked 
downright angry. &#147;Tell me I don&#146;t have this paper in front of me right 
now hinting at a quote &#147;Black Ops&#148; operation that&#146;s about to get 
underway?&#148;

&#147;I can&#146;t tell you that.&#148; she replied honestly, &#147;You know that.&#148;

&#147;I know that you&#146;re doing something rash again. So how many---&#148;

&#147;One. One that would have died anyway if I hadn&#146;t intervened. In any 
case she&#146;s no longer a threat---&#148;

&#147;YOU HAVE MIMIC THERE?!?&#148; Jack yelled, to which she quietly raised her 
hands and motioned him to calm down, &#147;She&#146;s no longer a threat because 
the thing that pulled her strings is gone.&#148;

&#147;Thing? You don&#146;t mean---&#148;

Catherine sighed, leaning backwards into her chair to stare listlessly 
at the ceiling, her voice fading as she spoke and her mind opened up 
to what was.

What Happened Before---

You see, this whole particular situation began truly began years and 
years ago when Clow Reed forged the original Clow Cards in the &#147;waking 
world&#148; (the Earth that he hailed from).

When he passed on he sealed the cards in the Clow Book and left 
Kerberos to guard them.

Over the natural course of time they would remain this way until the 
one who he had pre-planned to take his place as the world&#146;s most 
powerful mage opened the book.

It took a lot of questionable, and quite unethical acts to make his 
dream come true, but one day Sakura Kinomoto, his chosen one, opened 
the book and set the stage what should have been the creation of the 
world&#146;s next greatest mage.

That was before she came into the picture, Catherine Piccadello, where 
this divergence in events took place which brings us to where we are 
now.

Feeling a disturbance in a nearby dimension she investigated, and came 
upon the whole situation as it unfolded, with Sakura coming close to 
becoming the world&#146;s greatest mage.

But the situation was something Catherine would not tolerate, and for 
her own reasons she &#147;intervened&#148;. (She omits certain things at this 
point, things that she didn&#146;t need to say since she knew that Jack 
probably already knew this information without her saying it)

It was on the day of Sakura&#146;s Final Test, under the shadow of Tokyo 
Tower, that Piccadello brought her allies into play and fought for the 
very survival of this world. Eriol&#146;s minions fell quickly enough, and 
it was simple enough for Jack to find one soul whose strength of 
character and purity was enough to move mountains, or one stubborn 
moon back into it&#146;s rightful orbit.

But the power of the one who used to be Clow Reed was still potent. 
His patience, however, had fled him.

Catherine, who had thought she had him pinned down, was quickly 
overcome by him.

Two others, SpellThrashers, tried to take him out but were tossed 
aside.

Keiko Yamanaka, the 7th Judgement, tried to stop him but was hurled 
into a tree where she was impaled on a sharp protruding branch. Sakura 
tried to stop him, but was struck so hard that she hit the ground and 
bounced like a ragdoll. &#147;Eriol&#148;, it seems, was angry at the 
interference and had lost all sense of reason.

But it was in this few moments, when his reason had fled, that a 
distraught Tomoyo rushed to Sakura&#146;s side crying. She saw Eriol 
approaching, anger in his eyes, as he screamed at her to get away from 
his property (Sakura), his reason gone with only a rage which seemed 
to consume him remaining.

It could be said that it was building up ever since Piccadello first 
interfered, or perhaps it was by the manipulation of an outside force 
that made him so irrational, but one thing was certain -- he was 
beyond reason at this point.

At this moment Tomoyo blindly grabbed for her bag, to desperately make 
him go away, and swung blindly.

She had instead grabbed Keiko&#146;s fallen sword, her cursed blade, whose 
metal was unbreakable. And with her one swing, as Eriol knelt to grab 
Sakura by her neck, she decapitated him.

It was an accident. She didn&#146;t mean to. But as the blade swung through 
Eriol&#146;s body fell backward, parted from his head, his staff falling to 
one side apparently useless. The reincarnation of Clow Reed was dead.

However unlike Lord of the Rings the consequences to Tomoyo (killing 
him) was quite dire. It took a lot of effort to &#147;wipe&#148; her mind of 
what she did, lest it would weight terribly in her mind and slowly 
destroy her from the inside out.

As for the staff? The staff, the last remnants of this &#147;Clow Reed&#148;&#146;s 
power, laid there waiting for someone to take it. To perhaps use it or 
destroy it. However in her grief, Eve, Keiko&#146;s companion, got to it 
first. In a rage she ripped a portal into the dark passages between 
worlds, OtherSpace, and hurled it in.

The staff disappeared from all mention after that, and hasn&#146;t been 
seen since.

At least, that&#146;s how Jack remembers it. However---

The Here and Now.

&#147;Five days ago I felt the same dread I felt when I was on that world, 
Sakura&#146;s Earth, and I knew it had to be that staff. When that sphere 
appeared a few days later? I felt as if my dread was being justified 
and my suspicions were being proved as a simple truth.&#148;

Jack neither spoke nor moved, he simply stared at her. &#147;It&#146;s gone. I 
haven&#146;t felt any such dread in the past week besides the coming of 
CLAMP School, which only means the last piece of that bastard&#146;s power 
is gone for good. There&#146;s no way---&#148;

&#147;OtherSpace is not endless, nor is it capable of hiding a tool of such 
power for long periods of time. It held it, hid it from prying eyes, 
but only for a &#147;season&#147;. That season has passed, Jack, you know that.&#148;

&#147;So your preparing a &#147;welcoming committee&#148; for our new &#147;neighbors&#148; I 
take it? For what purpose? To find a staff that you only suspect might 
be there?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t see why your not doing the same.&#148; she countered, to which he 
shrugged and replied &#147;Someone has to keep the homefront safe.&#148; (looks 
at her seriously) &#147;Look, far be it for me to tell you what to do, but 
you better be careful while recruiting. I&#146;m not the only one who 
caught wind of this. The SpellThrashers also have heard of this and 
they&#146;re stepping up security around likely &#147;chosen ones&#148; to keep them 
from being recruited. If you plan on going on any other &#147;trips&#148; be 
careful, eh?&#148; (stops) &#147;What did you mean earlier? About Mimic?&#148;

Catherine smiled, and laid out her evidence before him.

Return to Flashbacks.

The staff, lying on the ground, was mostly intact when Eve heaved it 
into her hands, anger burning.

But she missed one shard. One small metal shard that broke free from 
the staff. One piece.

The metal shined dully in the new light of day, glistening with power, 
but untouched. By sheer coincidence it was dragged through the portal 
opened to take Piccadello and the others home.

However it did not end up where they did, but was drawn to Tokyo Tower 
where, in it&#146;s shadow, it waited.

Time passed, and dozens upon dozens of people picked up the shiny 
object only to feel compelled to throw it aside. None of them were 
suitable, so they felt that they had no use for the apparently 
worthless chunk of metal and dropped it.

But then, by chance, a suitable person came along.

The shard was picked up by a female who was a &#147;shard&#148; herself, a 
fragment of another being.

Mimic. A being that was part Clow created, hence perfect by the 
shard&#146;s simplistic reasonings.

The shard merged with her, and then it began to fill her head with 
lies. It was not particularly sentient, but it compelled her most base 
fears and need for love and acceptance to fill her with self deluded 
fears and hatreds. Why? It needed her emotions to run high so it could 
&#147;grow&#148; and be &#147;fed&#148; by her strengths as it exploited her weaknesses.

All her hatred and malice towards Mirra? It came from this one thing 
that pushed all her buttons and made her hate without even truly 
knowing why.

But that night she was stabbed by Hikaru? That&#146;s when it ended.

By sheer luck the blade sliced through near her heart, and dislodged 
the shard (already maturing into the raw material to form a new 
&#147;sealing staff&#148;) from her body, but not enough so it came out then and 
there. It was when Hikaru hurled Mimic through the windows of the 
Tower&#146;s observation deck that the shard fell loose. It tumbled out of 
her and fell into darkness.

And Back Once Again to the Here and Now.

&#147;Where is it now?&#148;

&#147;Gone again.&#148; she concluded, spreading her arms out as she talked. &#147;No 
doubt waiting and biding it&#146;s time until it finds another suitable 
&#147;host&#148; from which to work it&#146;s evil through.&#148;

&#147;No doubt.&#148; Jack concluded, &#147;Well, keep an eye out for things and do 
be careful.&#148;

&#147;I will.&#148; she acknowledged, watching the link cut off. As the room 
fell silent again she picked up the shard from a hidden spot on her 
desk and looked at it. The shard was as big as her fist, and made the 
most insistent racket in her head, but still -- &#147;Tempt me all you 
want, you can never give me what I truly want.&#148;

Her memory quickly flashed back to before, back on Sakura&#146;s world.

Catherine&#146;s Flashback.

One night she visited Tomoyo as she slept.

She laid in bed, her face red and stained with tears as if she cried 
herself to sleep.

Still, despite how untidy she appeared, she still was very beautiful 
to Catherine.

She knew that she could keep Tomoyo &#147;asleep&#148; by simply keeping Tomoyo 
from sensing her presence, but she wanted to do more while she did 
this. She climbed onto the bed until she was face to face with her 
young &#147;host&#148;, staring into her closed eyes. At that moment she did 
something quite rash, and leaned forward to kiss her on the lips.

Her lips brushed softly against the sleeping Tomoyo&#146;s lips, her heart 
banging against her rib cage hard as she kissed her while she slept, 
and wished for something she knew she could never truly have.

To wake up each and every morning, Tomoyo&#146;s smiling face and bright 
eyes greeting her, as she lazily laid in Catherine&#146;s arms and rested 
her head upon the older woman&#146;s bare breasts.

Without meaning to her arm slipped out from under her, and she fell on 
top of Tomoyo. She quickly strengthened her efforts to keep Tomoyo 
asleep, but was shocked as Tomoyo unconsciously wrapped her arms about 
her and hugged her tight.

At that moment she began to sweat, her heart was racing (which was a 
good thing that she was already &#147;dead&#148; once because she felt that it 
was going to explode if it raced faster), and she felt like crying 
herself. She rested her head on Tomoyo&#146;s shoulder and succumbed to her 
desires if only for the moment. But she had to grit her teeth and 
steel her resolve as deeper feelings surfaced.

Her hand brushed against Tomoyo&#146;s thigh, and the burning insistent 
urge to touch her -- she pressed herself close to Tomoyo to suppress 
those thoughts, hands gripping the sheets to keep them from wandering.

&#145;I just want to be close.&#146; she thought to herself, her words blurring 
as she chanted them in her head over and over again, &#146;I just want to 
be close. I just want to be here. I just want to be loved. I just want 
--- I just want to love --- YOU!!&#146;

The Here and Now.

Catherine&#146;s thoughts focused again as she dropped the shard into a 
tesseract sphere and then locked it away for safe keeping. &#147;Silly 
dreams.&#148; she chided herself, straightening up to her full height 
trying to keep her head up as she did, &#147;I&#146;m not cut out for a happily 
ever after ending.&#148;

Suddenly the commlink buzzed again. &#147;Now what?&#148;

As she clicked it on she saw Jack&#146;s face again, &#147;Silly me. I forgot.&#148;

&#147;Forgot what?&#148;

&#147;I have three high profile young ladies for your little &#147;insertion&#148; 
team if your ready to meet them.&#148;

&#147;Eh?&#148;

-----

Back to Tokyo

It was raining when Sakura woke up. It was the weekend so she didn&#146;t 
need to wake up early, but still she wished it was sunny. &#147;I was going 
to go blading&#146; too.&#148; she thought out loud, a sad mopey face greeting 
Tomoyo as she stared at her from the bedside, &#147;Sorry.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan!&#148; she gasped, nearly leaping out of bed, realizing too late 
that Tomoyo had brought breakfast for her in bed. &#147;I could have done 
that! I---&#148;

&#147;Hush.&#148; she firmly commanded, putting a hand on Sakura&#146;s shoulder and 
gently pressing her back into the bed, &#147;I want you to sit and eat 
breakfast. After all sometimes I want to be the one to surprise my 
precious in bed with breakfast.&#148;

&#147;---Tomo-chan---&#148; she whispered, feeling her face blush from the 
attention. As they ate the topic of the rain came up, &#147;Yeah. We were 
going to study also. I heard everyone is still coming though so we 
should scrap plans to do it outside and study in here today.&#148;

&#147;Hoeeee----&#148; Sakura whimpered. She loved Tomoyo a lot, and wanted to 
be her best for her, but she just didn&#146;t take to the idea of studying 
very well. In fact she was rather down on it the minute Tomoyo 
mentioned it. &#147;Studying---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s good for your grades. Have to bring them up before final exams.&#148;

&#147;Hooe!&#148; Sakura cried again, becoming more worried and stressed than 
she already was. She wasn&#146;t a particularly bad student, yet she wasn&#146;t 
a particularly good student either. Still, her highest trait was that 
she tested well. When she tested, at least, she did exceptionally 
well. It was the classes in between tests that troubled her the most. 
Still, as Tomoyo said, she could stand to bring her grades up before 
final exams regardless of whether she tested well or not.

As they ate a slight glint went across Tomoyo&#146;s eyes and Sakura had 
the suspicion that she was up to something. &#147;Tomo-chan? What are you 
thinking about?&#148;

&#147;Me? Nothing.&#148;

&#147;-----&#148; Sakura sat there, munching, yet staring at Tomoyo intensely as 
if waiting for her to admit something. Finally she did, in a soft 
voice, &#147;Cloud came to ask me for advice on how to keep Kero&#146;s heart.&#148;

&#147;Kero&#146;s heart?&#148; she asked, confused, as Tomoyo elaborated. &#147;I think 
they&#146;re in love, and Umi told me they&#146;ve been a &#147;pair&#148; since the 
beginning. But she&#146;s feeling a little insecure about keeping his 
feelings towards her strong so -- maybe --&#148;

&#147;Did you tell her that Kero loves video games and food?&#148;

&#147;I did.&#148;

&#147;And?&#148; Sakura leans forward, interested all of a sudden. &#147;She pouted 
and said &#147;Well THAT&#146;s so obvious!&#148; and stormed off in a huff. I think 
she was hoping for bedroom tips from me.&#148;

&#147;Bedroom---&#148; (Sakura turns bright red) &#147;---h-h-h-&#148;

&#147;Hoe?&#148; Tomoyo helps, to which Sakura nods her head up and down fast, 
practically glowing red with embarrassment. &#147;W-w-w-why?!? S-s-s-she&#146;s 
TOO young!!&#148;

&#147;Actually she&#146;s older than mama, so she&#146;s the right age--- you look 
like your going to faint.&#148;

Sakura&#146;s eyes spun, her face was red like a lobster, and she was 
sweating full ammo clips of sweat. &#147;AUUGGHH!!&#148;

&#147;I guess maybe you weren&#146;t ready for that yet.&#148; Tomoyo admitted, 
smiling meekly at Sakura&#146;s reaction.

It didn&#146;t help when five minutes later Kero came into the room asking 
if Cloud was ready for sex in her present form. Sakura screamed, 
cried, and hid beneath her blankets (thankfully she already finished 
eating breakfast before Kero showed up). &#147;Oh come on!&#148; Kero yelled, 
prodding her beneath her blankets as Tomoyo looked on rather 
concerned, &#147;Do we freak everytime you and Tomoyo do the nasty? Come 
on!! Help me out here!!&#148;

&#147;WAAHHHH!!!&#148;

&#147;I think Sakura-chan&#146;s having a bad day.&#148; Tomoyo whispered, nudging 
for Kero to leave. &#147;Well that&#146;s no good! What about our needs? We&#146;re 
grown individuals! Sure we look underaged but it&#146;s all perfectly 
legit!&#148;

Sakura just didn&#146;t seem to want to stop crying. Tomoyo spent five 
minutes just to coax her out of her blankets, and another five to get 
her to come to her &#147;lab&#148; kitchen on the second floor and ask for some 
advice on Cloud&#146;s predicament from the other Clow girls.

Umi, Gaia, Eve (Dark), Dawn (Light) &amp; Fuu (the Daidouji Estates&#146; maid) 
were all eating breakfast as Tomoyo led the rather shaky and spooked 
Sakura into the kitchen to talk. Umi looked at her from head to toe, 
and seemed concerned. &#147;Have you been introducing mistress to some new 
sextoys? She looks rather worn out and stressed today.&#148;

&#147;Maybe it&#146;s her diet. She needs more greens.&#148; Gaia mentioned, taking 
another bite out of her spinach omelet. &#147;Greens are always good for 
growing young women.&#148;

&#147;Mistress needs more time in the sun.&#148; Dawn noted, while Eve simply 
replied, &#147;She needs a good night&#146;s sleep. After the sex of course, but 
still she needs a solid sleep after the fun.&#148;

Fuu simply asked for more eggs and didn&#146;t add her two cents in, even 
at Tomoyo&#146;s insistence.

&#147;So,&#148; Umi finally asked, &#147;How far do you think they went?&#148;

&#147;PHHTT!!&#148; (Sakura spit out her drink looking flustered)

&#147;Now or before? Because they went beyond &#147;all the way&#148; before if you 
remember. When he was a big tiger and she was a full grown woman? 
They&#145;d do it like animals and--- mistress? Are you OK? You look like 
you&#145;re about to cry---&#148; Gaia adds, slowly looking rather concerned.

&#147;-----&#148;

&#147;Now of course! Then doesn&#146;t count because that was then, this is 
now!&#147; Umi remarked, ignoring Gaia&#146;s frantic look and her &#147;subtle&#148; 
motioning towards Sakura who looked nearly ready to faint, &#147;I bet sex 
between the two of them must be awkward as heck considering he&#145;s tiny, 
she&#145;s &#147;lolicon&#147; material, and---&#148;

&#147;Ahhhhhhhh!!!&#148; Sakura wailed, arms waving frantically to catch Umi&#146;s 
attention, &#147;Yes?&#148;

&#147;Do we need to talk about this?!? Can&#145;t we talk about something 
else?!?&#148;&#148;

&#147;Uh---&#147; (catches Gaia&#146;s frantic expression) &#147;Sure, mistress. But isn&#146;t 
the topic of Kero and Cloud the reason why you asked us in here for in 
the first place?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure Kero isn&#146;t equipped now to handle Cloud&#146;s needs.&#148; Dawn 
(Light) noted, &#147;She&#146;s been rather upset and uptight about their 
&#147;situation&#148; for sometime now. I think she&#146;s just frustrated that she&#146;s 
not getting any and---&#148; (Eve (Dark) nudges her to silence her) &#147;---oh. 
Sorry. Almost got too graphic.&#148;

Sakura was red from face to toe, obviously not needing very much to 
stimulate her imagination as to what was going through Dawn&#146;s head at 
the moment. &#147;Pwhee!!&#148; she cried, &#147;Why do I have to listen to this?!!?&#148;

&#147;Because your our mistress?&#148; Umi replied, laying out her advice as 
everyone listened with focused attentions, except for Sakura whose 
attention strayed as she was frozen with shock from having to listen 
to all this talk in the first place.

At that moment? Sakura wished she was somewhere else.

Tomoyo smiled, and placed her hands around Sakura&#146;s ear to help her 
drown out the words.

-------

When it came to her schoolwork one thing was abundantly clear. Sakura 
Kinomoto had her strong points, and she had her weak points.

When it came to her strong points? PE was one of them.

When it came to her weak points? Math, Japanese and English was some 
of them.

But Tomoyo remained persistent, and sat by Sakura&#146;s side once again as 
&#147;Study Buddies&#148; started, fully determined to help Sakura with her 
grades.

Some were there to help, like Rena (History) and Eve (general 
knowledge) for instances.

Some were there to learn, like Lina &amp; Syaoran Li for starters.

Some were there because their significant others were present (Keiko).

Some were there for the promise of free food as well as because their 
significant other was present (Nina).

All in all one thing was clear though, they were there, and they were 
there to learn.

Kero was of course banned from the room since everyone knew he would 
sway people with his Dark Side powers and lure studiers off to play 
video games. So he kept to his room with Cloud and played video games. 
Hikaru &amp; Mirra were present, even though their tests would be easier 
to master than Sakura&#146;s.

Still, Sakura was struggling abit. Math being the hardest for her.

It was during math study that she brought up the question of Ms. 
Mitsuki.

Nobody seemed to have an answer to that one. Now, yes, truth be told 
not many of the newcomers like Keiko and Nina liked Ms. Mitsuki, each 
for their own reasons. Sakura? She adored her. She made her feel all 
floaty. But still it wasn&#146;t like Tomoyo. Tomoyo made her feel as if 
she was skipping along heavenly clouds, Ms. Mitsuki made her feel 
&#147;floaty&#148;. There was a difference.

Keiko shrugged her shoulders and looked baffled at the sudden mention 
of her, &#147;I don&#146;t even know why your bringing her up. It&#146;s not like 
she&#146;s family or a die hard close friend, she just comes and goes of 
her own free will mostly.&#148;

&#147;Sorta like an alley cat only she doesn&#146;t seem to go into heat every 
so often -- then again she could be in heat right now and we wouldn&#146;t 
even know it which explains why she ---&#148; (sighs) &#147;---and Sakura&#146;s 
falling apart again so forget I mentioned anything.&#148;

Sakura didn&#146;t look like she could handle the topic of Ms. Mitsuki as 
an alley cat, let alone one in &#147;heat&#148;, so Keiko redirected the topic. 
&#147;I&#146;m sure she&#146;s fine. I checked with the school when she &#147;disappeared&#148; 
and they have it on record that she&#146;s on &#147;leave&#148; for awhile. I don&#146;t 
know why she&#146;s on leave, or why she didn&#146;t leave Sakura a message, so 
I&#146;m guessing it&#146;s personal business.&#148;

&#147;But still---&#148; Sakura sighed, her head turning slightly as Tomoyo puts 
her arm around Sakura&#146;s shoulder, &#147;I&#146;m sure she&#146;s just fine. We&#146;ll see 
her again.&#148;

Sakura smiles, and leans against Tomoyo briefly, basking in the warmth 
of her feelings, before going back to the numbers before her. For some 
reason the numbers seemed less daunting as long as Tomoyo was giving 
her help with the equations.

She knew she&#146;d see Ms. Mitsuki again, it was only a matter of time.

-----

She wished she didn&#146;t have to see Ms. Mitsuki, but she was part of the 
&#147;package&#148;.

As she stood in the observation room of the Medico Bay and watched 
over Mimic, Catherine entered the room. &#147;She knows we&#146;re here.&#148; Kaho 
noted.

&#147;Oh, really.&#148; Catherine replied, noticing part of the &#147;mirror&#148; was 
fogged up and someone had written the words &#147;HOW MUCH LONGER?&#148; on the 
glass. Kaho leaned back in her chair as she motioned to the words, 
remarking &#147;I think she&#146;s getting rather antsy.&#148;

&#147;That makes two of us.&#148; Catherine shot back half-heartily, looking 
through the glass at Mimic as she sat down, &#147;Jack sends his love and 
three new &#147;associates&#148; for the job.&#148; (sighs again) &#147;And why am I 
telling you all this anyway?&#148;

&#147;Because we&#146;re &#147;partners&#148; in crime?&#148;

Catherine didn&#146;t like the sound of that one bit, but Kaho elaborated, 
&#147;Without me you wouldn&#146;t have known when Mimic was good and ready to 
be &#147;picked up&#148;. Also you wouldn&#146;t have known to stay out of Tokyo and 
keep from recruiting while the SpellThrashers were keeping an eye out 
for any Clow girl recruitment drives after Mimic&#146;s disappearance. 
Speaking of Mimic, did you think it was wise to deploy her so soon---&#148;

&#147;Give it a rest already.&#148; Catherine hissed, &#147;You don&#146;t need to be 
psychic to know that security would have been kicked up several 
notches after Mimic&#146;s disappearance. That&#146;s common sense.&#148;

&#147;Is it &#147;common sense&#148; that Captain Lazarus called when he did? As I 
said he would? Is it also &#147;common sense&#148; that you need me if your 
ambitions are to---&#148;

&#147;You have ambitions too. Don&#146;t forget that.&#148;

&#147;I won&#146;t if you won&#146;t.&#148;

A bit of an unbearable silence fills the air as the two regard each 
other, &#147;Keiko&#146;s right, you are creepy.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll take that as a compliment.&#148;

&#147;Whatever---&#148;

Catherine stands up and motions towards Mimic who was sitting quietly 
in her bed waiting, &#147;Tell her it&#146;s not going to be much longer. We 
should be leaving soon.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll tell her that.&#148; Kaho agreed, looking back at the Clow girl. 
&#147;Anything else I should tell her?&#148;

&#147;Over your dead body.&#148;

The doors shut behind her, leaving Kaho alone to ponder the thinly 
veiled &#147;threat&#148;.

------

As she re-entered her private office she re-calculated her &#147;assets&#148;.

She had Mimic on her team. That&#146;s one.

Three more females who were well placed already in the world of CLAMP 
School. That&#146;s four.

Kaho Mitsuki. Like it or not she made five.

That left two more to go. But who---

A thin wispy feeling drifted across her mind. Short, brief, but there 
nevertheless.

She felt as if someone was crying out in their mind in anguish and 
pain. It was so faint she could barely hear it, but hear it she did. 
Somebody was hurting badly.

Dammit. Dammit, dammit, dammit. With that feeling etching into her 
mind slowly but surely she knew she had to shelf everything for now.

The mission, the work, even thoughts of her. She put them all aside 
and focused on her job.

And as she teleported out she felt something else as well.

This was the break she needed to finish her team. She could feel it. 
But why would she feel that now---?

Why with this feeling of dread and pain? It made no sense.

Yet. But it would soon.

Speaking of which she still had to check in on Mimic--- once she 
returned.

------

Cheerleading practice went well enough.

If not for the mere fact that Sakura&#146;s mind wasn&#146;t focusing on her 
tasks.

Twice she nearly dropped her baton. One time she did--- on her head.

All in all she couldn&#146;t stop thinking about everything that had been 
happening of late.

The new world in the sky above.

The missing Clow Cards that she still had to capture.

The appearance of Meilin sometime ago, and now Syaoran Li.

And now Kaho Mitsuki&#146;s disappearance.

There was a lot of things going on, and Sakura was behind on most of 
them. She felt rather out of the loop for someone who was charged with 
protecting this world from Clow Card disasters. She wished she didn&#146;t 
feel that way, but she couldn&#146;t help it -- it overwhelmed her at 
times, her responsibilities.

Maybe Tomoyo could cheer her up. As she walked along the school 
grounds after practice she heard Tomoyo&#146;s voice. It was low, at first, 
but then it started to grow.

She was singing. The voice just seemed to calm Sakura and ease away 
her fears as she listened.

She let the voice lead her to where Tomoyo was practicing, if only to 
watch her secretly as she sang.

As she reached the window she leaned against the wall and listened 
silently, Tomoyo&#146;s words seemingly taking her away from all her 
worries and concerns and lifting her up to a place where she could 
feel her burdens slipping away. She smiled, her arms wrapping around 
herself as she listened. &#147;She has a pretty voice.&#148; she sighs.

&#147;It is pretty.&#148; the voice whispers from behind her, sending Sakura 
spinning around in shock only to come face to face with, &#147;Meilin?!&#148; 
she whispered in shock, Meilin motioning for her not to panic, &#147;Shh!&#148; 
she hissed, motioning toward the windows where Tomoyo was practicing. 
Sakura quickly clamped her hand to her mouth and nodded her head to 
show she understood. As the two turned to listen, Meilin looked rather 
distant, her eyes staring at Tomoyo yet not at her at the same time.

&#147;Funny.&#148; she muttered, though it seemed that she was only talking to 
herself and not to Sakura at all, &#147;I thought Tomoyo would get over 
you. If she realized you and Li would be forever then -- maybe -- she 
would have found room in her heart for --- for--&#148;

&#147;For you?&#148; Sakura finished, to which Meilin nodded her head, &#147;But in 
the end we both got what we wanted.&#148;

&#147;Pwhee?&#148; Sakura whispered, to which Meilin replied, &#147;You got the love 
of your life even if you didn&#146;t know it would be Tomoyo, and I got the 
love of my life -- strange how the ones we were meant to be with 
aren&#146;t the ones we at first fell in love with. It&#146;s only after a lot 
of trial, heartbreaks, and errors that we find our true loves.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s deep.&#148; Sakura sighed, looking a little confused from it all, 
&#147;Xai&#146;s been telling me that I&#146;ve become rather deep lately in my 
words. I hope that&#146;s not a bad thing.&#148;

&#147;No--- maybe.&#148;

By now Tomoyo was done with practice, noticing Sakura waiting for her 
outside. As the two exchanged pleasantries and kisses, Meilin 
retreated away from the quiet scene, a bit of a smile on her lips.

------

Meanwhile --- CLAMP School (Tokyo)

Mimic reached the rooftop of the building overlooking Tokyo, her prey 
already ten steps ahead of her making good his escape. He seemed 
overall to be rather quick on his feet, even if he was wearing an 
outfit that should have, for all intents and purposes, been slowing 
him down. If the situation wasn&#146;t so dreadfully serious Mimic would be 
laughing right now. She was pursuing a young man in a black tuxedo, 
wearing a cape and mask, who called himself &#147;20 Faces&#148; (aka the Man of 
Many Faces). It was like she was chasing the even more annoying evil 
twin of Tuxedo Kamen (if such a thing was in fact possible).

Well, according to Catherine? What better way to capture a man of many 
faces than with a woman of many bodies? That, in a nutshell, was 
Catherine&#146;s job for her. Why she wanted him caught was not something 
she went into details on, but somehow Mimic felt it was overall better 
not to ask than to find out why.

Mimic mentally threw herself into &#147;Dash&#148; mode, mixing in Power&#146;s 
energy and Shot&#146;s shooting ability to help her gain some long range 
attack ability as she ran across the rooftop to catch her quarry. 
Still, even with these upgrades he seemed as elusive as he was when 
this chase started and all for a strange little trinket that seemingly 
had no real value. Why did he steal it? She couldn&#146;t say. Still, it 
was annoying that this normal human was outfoxing her when she gave 
the best of the best back home a good run for their money and still 
managed to get out on top most of the time (with a few failures here 
and there).

As they raced along the rooftops, leaping from one to the other, Mimic 
became aware of something else.

Someone was watching her.

Not Catherine, no, it wasn&#146;t her. She could feel someone else was 
there.

As she hit the ground running on the next rooftop she found herself 
staring at someone off to one side.

She stood there quietly, in the shadows, watching. She was tall, that 
Mimic could tell on her own.

She seemed rather shy, but yet she was intent on watching Mimic.

So focused on this she was that Mimic let her prey escape.

It&#146;s just as well. As the cops surrounded the streets below she 
figured it was time to rejoin her &#147;comrades&#148; and slip away again. It 
was a simple thing to shapeshift into a cop and mingle with other cops 
searching the buildings, slipping out and away without anyone 
noticing.

As she walked along the streets it seemed the it was Tokyo.

Everything about this Tokyo was the same at home except for a few 
things.

The huge mega-complex called CLAMP School being one of them.

Another being the giant Frigate sized vessels and giant mechas that 
patrolled the sky over Tokyo.

They were Autozam warships and Eagle/Falcon Mechs. But what they were 
doing there, manned by humans no less, remained to be seen. But then 
again that was one of the strange riddles that made up the vast 
tapestry that was the strange &#147;world&#148; of CLAMP School.

Mimic sighed as she felt her hunger rising, relinquishing herself to 
her need to eat.

But as she turned and wandered off into the crowds that someone was 
still watching her.

And making up her mind as she watched.</pre>
