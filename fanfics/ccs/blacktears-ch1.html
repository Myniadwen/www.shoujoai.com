<h1>Black Tears (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a>

<pre>	Sakura, Tomoyo, Naoko, Rika and Chiharu were sitting together
in the final minutes of the last class before the holiday weekend.
Before them laid three days of vacation. Mrs. Tsutsumi noticed their
little group, but let it slide, for she had already assigned homework
due for the following Tuesday.
	&quot;I hate math,&quot; Chiharu moaned, &quot;and Mrs. Tsutsumi, for that
matter.&quot;
	&quot;It`ll be over soon.&quot; Consoled Sakura.
	No sooner than she had spoken, the bell rang, and an unusually
mad dash for the door commenced. The group of friends were quickly
deciding what was to become of the remainder of the afternoon.
	&quot;I&#39;m going with Sakura to finish this math before I forget it
in the bottom of my school bag.&quot; Chiharu continued moaning, with a
slight smile.
	&quot;Tomoyo is coming too,&quot; Sakura began, &quot;what about you two?&quot;
The brown haired girl motioned to Rika and Naoko.
	&quot;Sure!&quot; Exclaimed Naoko, &quot;I&#39;ll phone my parents once we get to
your house, Sakura, just to make sure it&#39;s okay.&quot; She turned to Rika.
	&quot;Sorry,&quot; Rika said with an odd blush, &quot;but I have to get home.&quot;
She turned and went to her locker.
	Each girl waved goodbye as they left the classroom. Soon, they
were out of the school completely, and they were gossiping about the
latest rumour, that Shaolan was coming for a visit. While Sakura stayed
quiet, Naoko stopped and gasped. &quot;I forgot my coat! I have to get it
before they lock the school up for the weekend!&quot; Without waiting, she
started back into the school. &quot;I&#39;ll catch up!&quot; She cried over her
shoulder.
	In reality, Naoko had forgotten her coat on purpose. She wanted
an excuse to leave the group in case Rika declined the invitation.
	Naoko had been thinking of Rika a lot lately. And they were
not just the gentle thoughts of friends. Naoko thought about Rika in
awe. She was so fashionable, so mature, so gentle, so perfect. She was
everything Naoko wasn&#39;t, not that Naoko hated herself. She was just so
attracted to the other girl. Naoko knew what these thoughts made her,
and it was why she was uncomfortable with her other friends, why she
purposely forgot her coat. Naoko was afraid that somehow, in one moment,
she would let it slip out, and she was not ready for that.
	There were only two people she now was completely comfortable
around. Rika, because of her perfection, and Tomoyo. She suspected
Tomoyo felt the same way about Sakura that Naoko felt about Rika.
	Naoko touched the door of her home classroom, but froze.
Inside, she heard the voice of Rika, and who she thought was
Mr. Terada. Sliding the door open a crack, she confirmed it was the
two. There was something about the way the two people looked at
eachother that made Naoko unable to move.
	&quot;I love you too.&quot; Naoko heard Terada whisper.
	&quot;It was then the teacher and the student kissed, deeply. Naoko
could almost see their tongues probing one another`s mouth. Naoko
slowly closed the door, and silently made her way back outside. Her
coat was now the furthest thing from her mind. What was on her mind,
was her fantasies, her fantasies of being with Rika, now crushed by
the secret scene she had just witnessed.

	Sakura, Tomoyo, and Chiharu had finally arrived at Sakura&#39;s
house. They thought nothing of Naoko&#39;s extended absence, but
concentrated on Tomoyo&#39;s words.
	&quot;It&#39;s true. He e-mailed me. Shaolan is coming to visit.&quot; She
threw yet another smile at Sakura, who still was silent, staring at
the ground.
	It was Tomoyo&#39;s turn to gasp. &quot;Oh, darn! I&#39;ve just as bad a
memory as Naoko! I can&#39;t stay, my mom is coming back from her business
trip today! Sorry, but I have to get home!&quot; She had already her
cellphone out to call her bodyguards to pick her up.
	&quot;That&#39;s too bad.&quot; Replied Chiharu.
	&quot;We&#39;ll wait outside with you.&quot; Said Sakura, recovering from
the news of Shaolan.
	&quot;No, it&#39;s okay,&quot; Insisted Tomoyo, &quot;they&#39;ll be around shortly,
so there&#39;s no need.&quot; Tomoyo smiled sweetly.
	Sakura and Chiharu smiled back and said goodbye, and entered
the house. Tomoyo waited on the porch, distressed.
	Shaolan was returning, and still Tomoyo had not the courage to
tell Sakura her feelings. How her fears could keep her love hidden from
Sakura perplexed Tomoyo.
	Her thoughts were interrupted by Naoko, who finally caught up.
Tomoyo immediately explained who she was waiting for, and that Sakura
and Chiharu were already inside, but Naoko sat down beside Tomoyo, who
had taken to the bench on the porch.
	&quot;Tomoyo,&quot; Naoko began, slowly, &quot;can I ask you a personal
question?&quot;
	Tomoyo was slightly curious what the question could be, and
then, her normal, happy voice, replied, &quot;Of course, Naoko.&quot;
	&quot;Tomoyo,&quot; Naoko continued, her voice lowering, &quot;do you love
Sakura?&quot;
	Tomoyo froze. Her thoughts raced. How had Naoko found her out?
Could have Sakura found out? Could Sakura know? Her already pale skin
became so colourless that Naoko almost believed Tomoyo would fade away.
	&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Naoko said quickly, seeing Tomoyo&#39;s reaction, &quot;I
won&#39;t tell.&quot; She began to speak slowly again. &quot;Can I come over
tonight? I have some things to ask you.....it&#39;s not really about you
and Sakura, but it&#39;s important.&quot;
	Tomoyo spoke, her voice cracking, &quot;Not tonight,.....I.....not
tonight. But tomorrow will be fine, you can stay the night if you
want.&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s mind was whirling. A limousine pulled up in front of
the house.
	&quot;Tomorrow, then.&quot; Naoko said quietly, and entered the house as
Tomoyo entered the vehicle.</pre>
