<h1>Sometimes Fear Wins Out</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mwarrior1.html">Moon Warrior 1</a><br> </h2>
<pre>     (My apologies to those waiting for sequels to &quot;Time and what the
hell?:  I pretty much consider that a stand alone story.  Maybe a
short, one day. As for &quot;Am I too late?&quot;, I tried, but two things,
One, I have been ill at times, don&#39;t ask: Two: my microsoft word
kept eating it. My home computer is old.  So, I found a way around
it.  I&#39;m working on a new fic beside this one.  As for &quot;Pinch me.&quot;,
that too.  Now on with the fic.  And next time I&#39;ll present more
excuses.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

     It was late one night at the Kinomoto house.  Everyone except
Sakura... And one other was asleep.

     &quot;Come to bed Tomoyo.&quot;

     The beautiful black haired almost woman looked at Sakura, eyes 
piercing.

     &quot;Please.&quot;

     An almost sigh, combined with perhaps a bit of fear came from
the standing Tomoyo.  She went toward the bed and got in.

     Sakura put her arms around the other girl.  She then kissed her
on the cheek.

     &quot;Sakura...-&quot;: Came Tomoyo&#39;s voice

     &quot;Please.....Tomoyo.... I.... Need this.&quot;

     &quot;Yes mistress.&quot;

     &quot;Please, Don&#39;t c...  &quot;, Sakura closed her eyes hard, while
clenching her fist, then she reacted and got on top of Tomoyo.

     &quot;Sa... Mmmph.&quot;, Sakura kissed the other girl hard.  Her tongue
moving, causing the other&#39;s to fight back.  Sakura held Tomoyo&#39;s
arms hard.  Tomoyo got a push in. Sakura stopped.  She arched up
slightly, looking cown into Tomoyo&#39;s eyes.

     &quot;What is it?!&quot;

     &quot;I..&quot;, she whispered, &quot;I&#39;m not sure that I can do this.&quot;

     &quot;Please.... Tomoyo.&quot;, tears streaked down Sakura&#39;S face.

     &quot;I... I will try.&quot;

Sakura smiled, &quot;Thank you m... Tomoyo.&quot;

Sakura slipped a hand under Tomoyo&#39;s shirt, caressing her breast.

     &quot;OH!&quot;

     Sakura&#39;s thumb slowly rubbed circles around her nipple.

     Sakura brought herself doen on top of Tomoyo, once more lips
meeting.  Sakura gently kissed and licked Tomoyo&#39;s lips.  &quot;Hnnnn.&quot;

     Sakura&#39;s other hand went downwards, her hand between them and
going between Tomoyo&#39;S legs.

     &quot;To**.&quot;, she whispered.

     Sakura stopped:  &quot;WHAT DID YOU SAY?!.&quot;, not quite yelling, but
Sakura said it loud enough.

     Now Tomoyo cried, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I.. I COULDN... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

     &quot;Sakurs, you alright?&quot;, her father called.

     &quot;Just... Just a bad dream.&quot;

     &quot;Okay.&quot;

     Sakura was already out of bed.

     She looked at Tomoyo, still in bed.

     &quot;Why couldn&#39;t you love me?  Why couldn&#39;t you just be with me?&quot;

     &quot;I.. I love him, you know that.&quot;

     &quot;Don&#39;t... Mirror.&quot;, at that word the card returned to it&#39;s original 
form.

     Mirror looked at Sakura, eyes filled with sadness, &quot;I&#39;m sorry
mistress, I love you, but not like the way I love him.&quot;

    &quot;Why?  Why couldn&#39;t you have just been her?  With me.&quot;

    &quot;Why not go to her?&quot;

    &quot;Why?!  WHY?!!  I&#39;m with Li, I don&#39;t want to hurt him and Tomoyo
would hate me if I even suggested this.  She&#39;s the one who wanted
me to be with Li.  I would be betraying them both.&quot;

    Her father&#39;s sigh went through the house, either of hearing, or
simply not getting to sleep, Sakura didn&#39;t know.  And after a
moment, didn&#39;t care.

    &quot;Why?... WHY?!&quot;

    &quot;I... I am sorry... But...&quot;

    &quot;YES?&quot;

    &quot;I... I think you&#39;re wrong about Tomoyo.&quot;

    &quot;Mirror return.&quot;

    Mirror went back into the card.

    Sakura&#39;s hand went over her face, then..&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mirror, I&#39;m
sorry if I hurt you tonight.&quot;, she picked up the card, it glowed.

    &quot;I knew.. You said you understood.... I guess you do... But I 
can&#39;t...&quot;,

   &quot;I can&#39;t risk losing her.&quot;, Sakura got into bed and started to cry.

   Two cards rose from the now open Sakura book.

   &quot;Light, Dark.&quot;

   They appeared, holding hands.

   &quot;Sakura, give Tomoyo a chance.  She may feel that way about you.&quot;, 
Light

   &quot;Do not give up on love.&quot;, Dark

  &quot;I will tell you what I told mirror, I would die if Tomoyo
rejected me, if not my body, then inside.  That is why she cannot
know... AND I couldn&#39;t stand it, if we stayed friends, but she
pulled away from my touch.  THat I could see loathing in her eyes.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?&quot;

  &quot;Yes mistress, sorry.&quot;,they both said.

 &quot;Re-&quot;

  &quot;Wait.&quot;, Light, &quot;Let us be with you tonight.  We can at least hold you.&quot;

  &quot;Please, do not lie alone tonight.&quot;, Dark

  &quot;O.. Okay.&quot;

  They were there in an instant, and though Sakura cried in her
sleep, at least she slept and her crying did subside that night...
Eventually.

                     End.

  (What else happened, that&#39;s for another time.)

  Thank you, no flames please.  As for this, I just decided to do
one where, well the title says it all, as for the little deception,
there were clues.  I guess I did blend manga and anime a little.
But I think some will enjoy. </pre>
