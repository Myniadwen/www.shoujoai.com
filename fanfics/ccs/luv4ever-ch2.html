<h1>Love Forever (part 2 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Sakura put her things in Tomoyo&#39;s room, picked out some clothes and 
jumped in the shower. When she finished, she came back into the living 
room and sat on the couch until Tomoyo anounced that dinner was ready. 
She walked into the kitchen and was amazed at what she saw. Fresh Snow 
crab covered in butter, mashed potatoes with sour cream and onions, 
grilled veggies with rice, and a nice Green salad. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan! This looks great! When did you learn to cook like this!?&quot;

Tomoyo pulled out the cork to a bottle of red wine with a loud pop and 
set it on the table.

&quot;After you and Sayoran left, I became very depressed. My mother tried to 
talk some sense into me and said that I should at least try to meet 
somebody. She said that guys always love a woman who can cook and taught 
me everything she knew. I did end up meeting a few guys... and even one 
girl who said that they fell in love with me. But every time, my heart 
was broken. I eventually gave up on trying to find someone special and 
poured my heart and soul into my business. And my cooking.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Tomoyo-chan. I didn&#39;t mean to upset you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ok, you didn&#39;t. Thinking about it doesn&#39;t bother me much anymore. 
I guess I&#39;ve spent so much time alone, that I&#39;ve forgotten.&quot; Tomoyo said 
while choking back her tears.

&quot;Now... let&#39;s eat before it gets cold!&quot;

They ate their dinner and shared more stories. When they were done, they 
washed the dishes and sat down to enjoy the movie Tomoyo had rented. 
Afterwards, they both yawned and decided to go to bed. 

&quot;I think there&#39;s a spare nightshirt in the dresser if you want to use 
it.&quot; Said Tomoyo.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

Sakura undressed and poked her head into the shirt as Tomoyo climbed 
into bed. Sakura got a very tired and sad  look on her face and yawned 
again.

&quot;Sakura? Are you ok?&quot;

&quot;Yeah... I&#39;m fine I think. I&#39;m just tired. My body feels like a lead 
weight from travelling.&quot;

&quot;Come to bed. Maybe after you get some rest you&#39;ll feel better.&quot;

Sakura climbed into bed and nuzzled next to Tomoyo.

&quot;Tomoyo?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Thank You. Thank You for always being here for me.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re very welcome Sakura-chan.&quot;

Tomoyo put her hand on Sakura&#39;s head and played with her hair until she 
fell asleep. Tomoyo was as happy as she had been in 5 years as she laid 
there next to Sakura. She was happy that Sakura could still come to her 
in her time of need and that she still trusted Tomoyo after all those 
years apart. 

In the morning, Tomoyo awoke to Sakura&#39;s tossing and moaning in the bed.

&quot;Sakura... Sakura!&quot; She said while trying to wake her.

&quot;To...Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

Sakura&#39;s face looked pale as Tomoyo explained why she woke her up.

&quot;Are you ok Sakura? Your face is so pale! You look like you&#39;re going to 
be sick!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m ok... Just a little queasy, that&#39;s all. Nothing to be...&quot;

Sakura put her hand to her mouth and bolted for the bathroom. She 
slammed the door and Tomoyo could hear the distinct sounds of her friend 
being sick. Tomoyo rushed to the door and opened it to find Sakura 
kneeling beside the toilet with her head on her arm, trying to keep from 
throwing up again. Tomoyo knelt beside Sakura and rubbed her back. 
Sakura heaved and got sick again while Tomoyo held her hair so that it 
wouldn&#39;t get in the way. Tomoyo put her head on Sakura&#39;s back and hugged 
her. Sakura turned around and looked at Tomoyo&#39;s concerned expression. 
Slowly, she leaned towards her best friend and closed her eyes. Her eyes 
opened as her lips met two of Tomoyo&#39;s fingers.

&quot;Hoe..?&quot;

&quot;Sakura-chan needs to brush her teeth before she kisses me.&quot; Tomoyo said 
playfully.

Sakura could only blush and look away at Tomoyo&#39;s comment. Oh how she 
missed moments like that. Even if they were embarassing. When she was 
finished, Tomoyo helped Sakura back to bed.

&quot;You stay right here young lady, while I make you a Doctors 
appointment.&quot;

Tomoyo returned and sat down next to Sakura. She sighed and said that 
the Doctor couldn&#39;t see her until tomorrow.

&quot;Maybe that&#39;s a good thing right now.&quot; She said.

&quot;I&#39;m fine Tomoyo... really. See?&quot; Sakura said while trying to get up.

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!&quot; Said Tomoyo while forcing Sakura to lay back down. 
&quot;You&#39;re not going anywhere! You&#39;re going to stay right here in bed until 
you see the Doctor. Don&#39;t worry about anything. You need your rest ok?&quot;

&quot;Alright I&#39;ll stay in bed.&quot;

&quot;You promise?&quot;

&quot;I promise Tomoyo.&quot;

&quot;Good... I&#39;ll go make breakfast while you lie there and try to relax.&quot;

As promised, Sakura stayed in bed while Tomoyo did everything. She even 
brought Sakura her meals so she didn&#39;t have to get up to eat. Tomoyo 
stayed by Sakura&#39;s side throughout the night to make sure she was ok. 
The next morning, she helped Sakura get dressed and they headed for the 
Doctor&#39;s Office. The Doctor said that they would run some tests and get 
back to them in a few days. In the meantime, he gave Sakura some 
medicine to help with her upset stomach. They were called back a few 
days later to discuss the test results. Tomoyo sat next to Sakura and 
held her hand for support.

&quot;Well, we have the results back from your tests. It seems that you&#39;ve 
only got a case of food poisoning. Nothing to be concerned about. Can 
you think of anything you might have eaten in the past few days that 
could do this?&quot;

Tomoyo got wide eyed and concerned look as she cried out:

&quot;I hope it wasn&#39;t my cooking! I&#39;d never forgive myself if I made poor 
Sakura-chan Ill!&quot;

Sakura sweatdropped and said that was impossible.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Tomoyo, it&#39;s probably that little bit of Airline food I 
ate.&quot;

The Doctor told them that it would go away in a few days and to keep 
taking the Medicine he gave her.
