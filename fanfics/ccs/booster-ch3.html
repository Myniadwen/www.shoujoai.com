<a href="../ccs/booster-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Touya?&quot; Fujitaka&#39;s voice was quiet as always. &quot;It was your turn to do 
the laundry today, right?&quot;

The dark head nodded. &quot;Yes, Everything&#39;s folded and put away.&quot;

&quot;Mmm.&quot; Fujitaka looked mildly put out. &quot;That&#39;s odd, I was sure I had 
an extra pair of socks in my drawer, and I have to pack for the 
weekend conference. I can&#39;t seem to find them....&quot;

&quot;You can borrow one of mine.&quot; Touya stood up from the kitchen table, 
but stopped as Sakura ran down the stairs into the room.

&quot;Has anyone seen my new socks?&quot; Sakura shot an annoyed look at Touya, 
as if she suspected him of stealing. &quot;I mean, I have one of them, but 
I can&#39;t find the other &#150; and it was your turn to do the laundry.&quot;

Touya shrugged. &quot;I didn&#39;t take your socks.&quot; Turning back to his 
father, Touya gestured. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;

Sakura and Fujitaka shared a confused glance, then watched Touya turn 
the corner on the stairs. They could hear his footsteps go down the 
hall, enter his room. There was a pause as, assumably, he opened his 
dresser drawer. A second or two passed, and all of a sudden, Touya&#39;s 
agitated tread was audible once again. 

Uncharacteristically, he came tearing down the stairs, taking the 
steps two at a time. Touya charged into the kitchen, each hand 
clutching a single object.

Holding the items up, he looked at his father and sister and said, 
&quot;Okay &#150; who took my socks?&quot;

Sakura started to laugh at her brother&#39;s indignation. 

Then she sensed it. 

No...it couldn&#39;t be...she looked up and saw Kero-chan waving one paw 
frantically behind her brother&#39;s head.

&quot;Um...maybe the washer&#39;s broken, I&#39;ll go check!&quot; And she was out of 
the room. 

Once in her bedroom, she stared at Kero-chan in disbelief. &quot;You&#39;re not 
telling me that Clow created a....&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; the Seal Beast confirmed with a grimace. &quot;It&#39;s responsible for 
all missing socks.&quot;

Sakura rubbed her face with both hands. &quot;One day, Kero-chan, you&#39;re 
going to have to tell me again just how brilliant Clow was. But first, 
let&#39;s go get the Sock Card.&quot;
