<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Fujitaka, Touya, and Yukito arrived and met Tomoyo in the waiting room. 
She asked that they wait for her mother before going to see Sakura, and 
that she would like to buy everyone a drink. Sonomi rushed in and 
demanded to be told where her daughter was.

&quot;Mother!&quot;

She rushed over and hugged her daughter tightly, almost lifting her off 
her feet. She felt the bandage on Tomoyo&#39;s head and turned her around to 
get a better look.

&quot;My goodness! Are you ok!?&quot; She said while gently running her fingers 
over it.

&quot;I&#39;m fine Okaa-sama. Please don&#39;t worry.&quot;

Sonomi gave Tomoyo a kiss and asked how Sakura was doing. 

&quot;She&#39;s ok. She&#39;s resting right now.&quot;

The nurse came over and said that it was ok for them to visit and wait 
in her room. Tomoyo sat next to the bed while Fujitaka gave his daughter 
a kiss on the cheek and ran his hand through her hair. She smiled and 
shifted slightly at his touch. Sakura&#39;s doctor came in and told everyone 
what was going on.

&quot;Sakura is going to be alright. She has a slight concussion, and a small 
cut on her lip, but other than that she&#39;s ok. But because she&#39;s 
pregnant, we&#39;re going to keep her overnight for observation.&quot;

Everyone shook his hand and thanked him for his help. While they waited 
for Sakura to wake up, Touya turned on the T.V. to help calm his nerves. 
He flipped through the chanells until he came across a news report about 
Sayoran.

&quot;Can you turn that up please Touya?&quot; Asked Tomoyo.

&quot;In local news, a man who escaped from a Maximum Security prison 
yesterday was re-captured this evening after assaulting his ex-wife and 
her lover at their upscale downtown apartment. Police credit a state of 
the art security system, and a quick thinking citizen who saw the male 
running from the building for their arrest. The man, identified as 
Sayoran Li, was serving 25 years to life for robbery and kidnapping when 
he managed to slip out of the prison undetected in a garbage truck. He 
is now facing 2 counts of attempted murder, and 1 count of break and 
enter. Police say they are glad he&#39;s back behind bars, and that they 
will have a full statement for us tomorrow. Residents of this community 
are thankful that he was captured so quickly, and now, people can rest a 
little easier knowing that another dangerous thug is where he belongs... 
behind bars.&quot;

Touya clicked off the T.V. and looked back at his baby sister sleeping 
peacefully on the bed.

&quot;I wish I was there. I feel like I let her down because she got hurt.&quot; 
He said while holding her hand.

He stood up and walked over to the window and sighed. Sakura stirred and 
started to wake.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the only one here Sakura-chan.&quot;

Everyone stood around her bed and smiled as she sat up. She looked a 
little wobbly, so Tomoyo put her hand on her back to support her.

&quot;Thank You everybody.&quot;

&quot;I have some good news Sakura-chan. The police found Li. He&#39;s been 
arrested and he&#39;s going back to jail for a long, long time.&quot;

Sakura sighed in relief and asked if they could go home.

&quot;The doctor said he wants to keep you overnight, just to be safe.&quot;

Sakura frowned and said that she was going to go crazy if she had to 
stay. Especially without her Tomoyo-chan there to keep her company. 
Tomoyo blushed and kissed Sakura on the cheek as if to say thank you. A 
nurse came in and said that because Li was a drug user, Sakura had to 
get a shot to make sure she wouldn&#39;t catch any disease that he might 
have had. Sakura hated needles. 

&quot;Do I have to?&quot; She pouted.

&quot;Yes Sakura, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

She tensed up and squeezed Tomoyo&#39;s hand for comfort. 

&quot;Kaiju. Are you still scared of needles?&quot;

She nodded as she tried to hide under the covers. 

&quot;Could everyone please give us some privacy?&quot; Asked the nurse.

&quot;Why?&quot; Asked Touya. &quot;It&#39;s only a needle.&quot;

Yukito whispered something in Touya&#39;s ear. His face flushed and he 
walked out. Tomoyo asked the nurse why everyone had to leave and if she 
could stay. Sonomi whispered to her why and Tomoyo giggled. Sakura 
didn&#39;t know what was happening. She just wanted this to be over, so she 
stuck out her arm, closed her eyes, and held her breath, waiting for the 
sharp prick that was sure to follow. She was surprised when she was 
leaned forward and pricked in the backside.

&quot;OW!&quot; She said while rubbing her butt.

&quot;There. All done.&quot;

With the chaos at the apartment earlier, she didn&#39;t have time to put on 
any clothes other than her pink boxers and an undershirt.

&quot;Now, get some rest young lady. If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll have to come back and 
give you another needle to put you to sleep.&quot; The nurse chided plafully.

Sakura put her hands on her backside and promised to get some rest. 
Tomoyo giggled at her and Sakura smacked her on the head with her 
pillow.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan! You&#39;re so mean! You&#39;re not supposed to laugh at me!&quot;

Sakura pouted and laid back on the bed as Tomoyo fixed her now messy 
hair.
