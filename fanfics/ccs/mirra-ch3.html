<h1>Mirra's Trilogy (part 3 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/mirra-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Christmas was almost here.

Days passed after their trip to go skiing on Hikaru&#146;s birthday, and 
her wish.

Mirra followed suit, changing her appearance to be what she would be 
if she was 14. Briefly she had a regret pang, thinking back to the 
pain Hikaru went through for her growth. But to that she only smiled 
and scolded Mirra gently for her concerns, telling her that the pain 
slide into the back of her mind once she felt Mirra holding her tight 
and comforting her.

Still, it didn&#146;t ease Mirra&#146;s visions. She began to have worst 
&#147;visions&#148; than before.

Now she was being punished by Mimic &amp; Hikaru, and she couldn&#146;t stop 
dreaming it no matter what Hikaru said. She wanted to listen to 
Hikaru&#146;s comforting words, and block out the thoughts that plagued her 
nights, but she couldn&#146;t--- and she didn&#146;t know why.

It was now the early morning hours of Christmas Eve, December the 
24th, 2002.

Hikaru was wide awake, thinking back to her phone call earlier that 
day---

-----

Flashback

&#147;Huh?&#148; Umi asked over the phone as they talked, &#147;You want to ask me 
something?&#148; (silence, almost as if Umi&#146;s mind was racking over the 
ideas she was having as she pondered the request) &#147;Anything special?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s important. I was hoping you&#146;d hear me out and---&#148;

&#147;Of course. Of course. Besides which it&#146;d be great because I&#146;d like to 
spend time with my little Hikaru-chan before Christmas. Come over 
tomorrow, I already did my shopping and mama is going to be out doing 
her last second shopping with aunties Hikaru, Fuu &amp; Presea so we&#146;ll 
have the house to ourselves. I&#146;ll see you tomorrow morning bright and 
early?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;d be great. Thank you, papa---&#148;

&#147;Anything for my little girl--- I mean my precious, all growing up 
and---&#148; (stops, breath hanging as if waiting for Hikaru&#146;s next words.) 
&#147;---uh--- there is something though--- you&#146;re bringing Mirra, right?&#148;

&#147;Umi-papa---? Of course I am--- why?&#148;

&#147;Something happened a few days ago---&#148;

&#147;Umi-papa---?&#148;

-----

She carefully peels back the blankets to reveal her chest, a few 
finger of her left hand gently poking her more mature breasts. She had 
been getting used to her bigger body for the past few weeks, but 
almost came to a lament after allowing a few seconds of prodding to 
pass. &#147;My breasts are bigger and nobody notices.&#148; A few seconds pass 
before a thin smile etches across her lips, the blankets pulled back 
up to her neck. &#147;Silly me. Worrying about people not staring at my 
chest. What a ridiculous thought to have.&#148;

Suddenly Mirra cries out softly, her hands clenching as she rolls onto 
her face, hands gripping the bedding tight. She was having another 
night vision, and it wasn&#146;t a good one. Slowly, gently, Hikaru pries 
Mirra&#146;s fingers open and pulls the shivering girl into her arms, 
holding her tight. She was sweating, and her mouth moved without a 
word coming forth but Hikaru knew what was happening all the same.

&#147;Oh Mirra--- little Mirra-chan---&#148;

She was having another tormenting vision, and there was nothing Hikaru 
could do to stop it.

All she could do was hold onto her and comfort her until the dream ran 
it&#146;s course, but she didn&#146;t like feeling so powerless all the same. 
She wanted to do something---- but didn&#146;t know what to do.

She fell back asleep a few minutes after Mirra, both clung together as 
they slumbered.

-----

Mirra knew that she was invited to go with Hikaru to her home to speak 
to Umi, but Hikaru didn&#146;t want to wake Mirra up so fast after her 
night vision. She left the girl lying in bed, sleeping contently.

The door to Sakura&#146;s &#147;lab&#148; swung open, and Hikaru almost felt as if 
she was still unwanted in this place even though Sakura made it a 
point to make Hikaru feel right at home there, free to use the kitchen 
whenever the urge to cook for herself and Mirra came over her.

But still, she couldn&#146;t quite shake the thought of a small indignant 
individual waving his fist at her and yelling &#147;You STYU-PID GHIRL!&#148; 
(thick accent) &#147;GET OUT OF MY SEHCRET LAHBHORATHORY!!&#148; (she stops as 
she looks down, feeling a tingle race up her spine at the sight of the 
not so happy Kerberos) &#147;Good morning, Kero.&#148;

Mirra introduced her to Kero once she knew about Mirra&#146;s powers, and 
moved into the house. They got along rather well, and for him to frown 
at her like that---

&#147;Feed me.&#148; Kero growled, sitting at the table in that worrisome 
&#147;indignant&#148; posture that Hikaru was so worried about a few seconds 
ago. &#145;Oh.&#146; Hikaru thought to herself, the weight from her shoulders 
lifting abit, &#145;He&#145;s hungry.&#146;. And with that she started to cook, 
sparring Kero a brief glance over her shoulder as she did. &#147;Didn&#145;t get 
breakfast yet?&#148;

&#147;Sakura won&#146;t wake up until 9AM, and Tomoyo is going shopping so she 
told me to wait for Sakura to wake up! Wait for Sakura! What a thing 
to say to me!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll make you a few pancakes as I make Mirra and myself breakfast. Is 
that OK?&#148;

&#147;Melted butter and syrup on mine!&#148;

&#147;Ok. Ok. I&#146;ll get to work---&#148; she agrees, head bobbing up and down 
with a smile on her face, as she puts her apron on and starts prepping 
for pancakes. The apron was a gift from Tomoyo, and was a rather 
fanciful yet risque apron, and it often made Hikaru blush to put on 
such a &#147;stimulating&#148; thing. It was a pink apron, with a mostly naked 
Makoto (except for an apron) kissing a naked Ami while holding a pan 
in her free hand (flipping pancakes) with the words &#147;Service Given 
Pipping Hot!&#148;. Nina thought the Sailor Mercury/Jupiter apron was cute, 
and also very accurate. After all, Nina once said---

-----

Flashback

&#147;Oh, yeah.&#148; Nina remarked once while noting the apron, her stomach 
growling while she waited for Hikaru to make something to eat. &#147;While 
they were compiling notes for Sailor Troopers (I played Trooper Venus 
by the way) we found out that the Mako/Ami in this Realm of Dreams do, 
in fact, love each other. Makes sense if you think about it, too.&#148;

&#147;How so?&#148; Hikaru asked as she leaned over to check her cooking.

&#147;Well, you see, Sailor Jupiter is the cook/cleaner of the coupling 
(teaches self defense to make credits while she&#145;s at it) while Ami 
makes a bundle as a medical specialist. However, and this is just 
between us and the pots and pans, I think Ami might starve to death if 
she wasn&#146;t married to Mako.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;Well, truth be told I know she can cook abit, and doctors are nice 
and all but do they really know how to cook? Doctors, I mean. After 
all, the doc on the ship I work on can&#146;t even boil water! I wonder if 
Ami can boil water (considering her powers is water based)---?&#148;

Hikaru shrugged and politely went back to her cooking. And, just like 
then, she was no closer to an answer to that oddly asked question than 
when Nina asked it that time back when that memory happened.

------

Suddenly she felt a presence near her. She turned to speak to Kero but 
found herself staring into Tomoyo&#146;s beautiful eyes instead. 
&#147;To-tomoyo-chan!&#148; Hikaru spat out, surprised. But as she watched, she 
noticed Tomoyo&#146;s smile only grow wider as she watched Hikaru cook. 
&#147;Good morning, Hikaru-chan. Your pan&#146;s ready for batter now.&#148;

&#147;Oh!&#148; she gasped, reaching over and pouring batter into the readied 
pan to let it cook. &#147;I thought Kero said you were going Christmas 
shopping today?&#148;

&#147;I only have a few things to get.&#148; Tomoyo responds as she takes a seat 
on the table, &#147;Sakura is going to meet me at New King Penguin Park and 
we&#146;re going to have lunch at the outdoor eatery that opened there. 
It&#146;ll help Sakura unwind from the events of the past few weeks.&#148;

&#147;Would you like some breakfast?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll make myself something after you, just keep the stove on.&#148; 
(sighs) &#147;Sakura&#146;s been rather stressed after losing Fight that time in 
the park, and then the zoo incident. I&#146;m glad she&#146;s taking today to 
relax--- maybe later we&#146;ll---&#148; (sighs) &#147;---What&#146;s your plans with 
Mirra going to be like?&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re seeing Umi-papa today.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148; (looks at Hikaru) &#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;Nothing&#146;s wrong, I just---&#148; (flips pancake onto plate, smiling) 
&#147;---breakfast is done, Kero. Hold on a second---&#148;

&#147;Wahoo! Pancakes! Pancakes!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s almost ready---- here you go.&#148; (plops plate down in front of 
him) &#147;Just the way you like it.&#148;

&#147;Yah!!&#148;

As she goes back to making pancakes she feels Tomoyo near her, 
prodding her. &#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m--- I&#146;m---&#148; (Hikaru leans her head back, taking a deep breath as 
she calms herself) &#147;---I&#146;m going to ask Umi-papa to let me stay with 
Mirra-chan--- forever.&#148;

&#147;Forever?&#148;

&#147;Uh-huh---&#148; Hikaru blushes at the thought of it, her face turning abit 
red. &#147;---are you angry?&#148;

&#147;No. Not at all---&#148; (smiles) &#147;---you make each other so happy. Like 
Sakura-chan makes me happy.&#148;

&#147;I know. Mirra often says how she wants to be just like Sakura-chan 
one day. Brave as her, beautiful as her--- I keep telling her she&#146;s 
already brave, and beautiful, and more--- but you know Mirra.&#147;

&#147;I hope you two have it easier than we did before I knew how Sakura 
truly felt about me.&#148;

&#147;Phwee?&#148;

&#147;Better be careful, your pancake is ready.&#148; Tomoyo deflected, 
motioning as Hikaru quickly flips it onto the plate. Through the 
corner of her eye she notices Tomoyo leaving the kitchen, &#147;I&#146;ll be 
back to cook my breakfast in a few minutes.&#148; and said nothing else as 
she walked out.

True to her word, she returned. But during that time she left Hikaru 
to ponder their talk by herself, and when she came back she said not a 
word about Hikaru and Mirra&#146;s plans but went right to work. &#147;Sakura&#146;s 
up so I invited her to breakfast with me in bed.&#148; she says with a 
smile, working on breakfast as Hikaru leaves the room, cart of 
food/drink ahead of her, pushing it along to their bedroom.

------

Mirra was just waking up when Hikaru presented breakfast. As they 
busied themselves to eating, she could feel Mirra&#146;s nervousness. 
&#147;Don&#146;t be so tense. Umi-papa is excited that we&#146;re visiting.&#148;

&#147;She doesn&#146;t know yet---&#148;

&#147;I know it might seem like a scary thing to ask,&#148; she started, taking 
another bite of her pancake as she did, &#147;but I won&#146;t relent on this. I 
want to be with you, and I want her blessings--- I just want to know 
that I have her blessings and she is happy for us--- but if I have to, 
I&#146;ll stay with you without her blessings.&#148;

&#147;Hikaru-chan!&#148;

&#147;Our happiness is important. But Umi-papa will understand--- you&#146;ll 
see---&#148;

For a second Mirra didn&#146;t know what to say, her stomach feeling the 
cold shivers from Hikaru&#146;s words, but a soothing hug and a gentle 
smile soothed her feelings--- if only for awhile.

They returned the minute the huge gates of the mansion where Umi lived 
opened, and they walked through. The house was as large as 
Tomoyo-mama&#146;s, but had it&#146;s own ambiance and style to it.

In the front of the house was a beautiful fountain upon which three 
statues (one of Umi surrounded by a water effect with nighttime 
illumination, one of Hikaru with a special fire display which came on 
at night, and one of Fuu standing on a base surrounded by green 
crystals which were illuminated at night) stood. The first thing 
Presea said about the display when she first saw it was &#147;Planning to 
turn your house into a Las Vegas Casino?&#148; (They haven&#146;t gotten along 
very well after that, and it&#146;s only the fact that Hikaru and Presea 
are a happy couple that makes Umi act sociable while the two are 
together near her.)

The maid shows the two up to her old room where they sit on the bed 
waiting for Umi to come out of her office--- where she was hiding with 
the case of butterflies in her stomach (or so the maid said). The room 
was rather beautiful, and resembled the rooms in the Daidouji 
Residence greatly. One thing did catch her eye that was different 
though, a costume.

&#147;This an old costume from Halloween?&#148; Mirra asked, picking up the 
costume and feeling a strange sense of recognition from it. &#147;That? No. 
Tomoyo-chan is teaching me to make costumes. That&#146;s something I was 
doing in school for extra credit before I moved in with you--- 
speaking of which I should move my designs into our room when I move.&#148;

&#147;---Tomoyo-mama---?&#148; Mirra gasped, looking at the costume in hand. 
&#147;---why---?&#148;

&#147;I figure my brave future Card Captor might want her first costume the 
day she starts being the Mistress of the Cards. Though I didn&#146;t think 
you&#146;d turn out to be a Clow Card too.&#148;

&#147;---costume---?&#148; Mirra choked, thinking about all the times 
Sakura-papa looked so nervous when presented with a new costume. &#147;But 
H-h-hikaru-chan---&#148;

&#147;I won&#146;t get carried away.&#148; she announced, bringing a sense of relief 
to Mirra, &#147;Still I want my precious to be prepared for anything. So 
I&#146;m making a few costumes and you better open your bag---&#148;

&#147;---Tomoyo-mama---&#148; Mirra rasped, head lowered, &#147;What are you teaching 
her?!&#148; but then a thought hits her. &#145;Open my bag?&#146; She quickly does, 
but before she can ask why there&#146;s a knock at the door, to which 
Hikaru responds. There, at the door as it opened, was Umi, her breath 
ragged as she looked about the room. &#147;Ran--- all the--- way up---&#148; 
(looks again) &#147;That thing--- isn&#146;t in--- here is---&#148;

&#147;Mokona&#146;s at Auntie&#146; Hikaru&#146;s.&#148;

&#147;Oh--- good---&#148; (her breath eases as she stands upright, straightening 
her clothes) &#147;Ahem--- ah--- well---&#148; her eyes falls on Mirra, and her 
mouth slides into a smile making Mirra shiver abit. &#147;Mirra-chan! It&#146;s 
been awhile---&#148; (face blanks) &#147;---well, it&#146;s been awhile. How are 
you?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine.&#148;

&#147;Well then--- nothing like some Christmas cake to make for 
conversation! I have some downstairs so we can get going and---&#148; 
(before Mirra could respond she was already being motioned out the 
door with Hikaru following, her bag left on the bed where---)

&#147;---?---&#148;

A few seconds later, a little head pokes out. And a not too enchanted 
Kero heaves himself out of the opening in the bag. &#147;Cake---? Cake??&#148; 
he mutters, his temper flaring as he begins to wail and throw his fist 
about in a tantrum. &#147;I WANT CAKE TOO!!&#148;

&#147;ME TOO!&#148;

&#147;YEAH! WE WANT CAKE!! WE WANT CAKE!! WE---?&#148;

He turns around, coming face to face with a little girl (about a head 
and shoulder shorter than Mirra) wearing a strange head gear, eyes 
shut as she waves her little fists up and down wailing &#147;WE WANT CAKE!! 
WE WANT CAKE!!&#148;

&#147;---?----&#148;

Suddenly she stops and opens her eyes, staring at Kero for a few 
seconds. Silence reigns as they both look at each other--- before---

&#147;CAKE!!&#148;

Kero leaps into the air, shocked, as he begins fluttering in circles, 
with her running in the opposite direction (shocked by Kero&#146;s sudden 
move) &#147;AGH! Monster!&#148;

&#147;Cake! Cake!&#148;

&#147;Monster! Monster!&#148;

&#147;Cake! Cake!&#148;

&#147;Mon---&#148; Kero suddenly stops, and looks down at the form running 
about. A few seconds later a deep, tired groan escapes his lips as he 
begins to lower himself down to face her at her eye level. &#147;Cloud--- 
Cloud--- stop that---- Cloud---&#148;

&#147;Cake! Cake!&#148;

&#147;CLOUD!!&#148; Kero finally snaps, bringing Cloud to a dead halt, her 
little fists clenched as she looks up at Kero. &#147;What?&#148;

&#147;What are you doing here?!&#148;

&#147;Cake!&#148; she spits out, and with that she quickly runs back to the huge 
bed and jumps on it, bouncing on it a few times before falling dead 
asleep on it.

&#147;---nothing changed with you I see---&#148; Kero moans, watching her 
slumbering on the bed, her form going back to misty as she &#147;vanishes&#148; 
(until woken again by the announcement of &#147;cake&#148;). &#147;---sigh---&#148;

-----

While the three sat outside, Umi showed the two a huge cake she bought 
(Christmas themed). With that, suddenly, Hikaru asked to bring two 
pieces of cake somewhere and left with them rather quickly.

&#145;Must want me to spend some time with her mom.&#146; Mirra thought out, 
smiling nervously as she and Umi waited for Hikaru to return. Tense 
minutes passed as the two sat quietly, rather uncertain what to say 
without their comfort barrier (Hikaru) between them. Behind them a 
voice called out, &#147;Tea party for two?&#148;

Umi groaned and turned to address the speaker. &#147;I thought you went 
shopping.&#148;

&#147;I did---&#148; Presea announced, stepping into view with arms burdened 
with bags. &#147;See? But I finished and they wrapped all the stuff there 
and now I&#146;m home again. Hikaru wanted some alone time, I think she&#146;s 
still not finished with my shopping yet.&#148;

&#147;Heaven forbid.&#148; Umi sighs, waving her off. &#147;Right now I have guests 
and don&#146;t have time---&#148;

&#147;May I have some?&#148; Presea asked, pointing at the cake. With a slight 
nudge she pushed her way into a free seat, without even waiting for 
Umi to answer, and moved to dig in. &#147;This looks great--- ouch!&#148; Presea 
yelps, pulling her arm back. &#147;What was that for?&#148;

&#147;Wait for Little Hikaru before you dig in! And where are your 
manners?&#148; (motions to Mirra)

&#147;Oh--- sorry.&#148; (shakes hands with Mirra, who smiles yet sweatdrops 
slightly) &#147;Hi.&#148;

&#147;Hi.&#148; she manages to say, abit uncertain about what to do next. Umi, 
however, was already moving once she noticed Hikaru returning. &#147;Let&#146;s 
have some!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll have some!&#148; Hikaru called out, bringing a smile to Mirra&#146;s lips 
as she sat back down and the two in unison took a bite. &#147;Mmmmm---- 
delicious!&#148; Hikaru sighed, the cake tasting so wonderful. Mirra was 
enjoying her piece as well, as was Umi &amp; Presea (despite the fact that 
she wasn&#146;t invited).

&#147;I love this cake. When I first treated Hikaru &amp; Fuu to it I thought 
they were going to explode from happiness. Their first bite brought 
such a happy expression to their faces.&#148;

&#147;Yeah. Hikaru loves this cake.&#148; Presea agreed, bringing a irked 
expression from Umi as Presea caught the girls&#146; attention. &#147;She can&#146;t 
get enough and sometimes I have to hide it so she makes me dinner 
because if she sees the cake first she wants to eat cake before 
dinner.&#148;

&#147;Haven&#146;t you learned to cook yet?&#148; Umi growled, eyes narrowed, her 
mood suddenly changing once she noticed the girls&#146; eyes on herself. 
&#147;Uh--- sorry. Just had a bad thought.&#148;

&#147;---oh----&#148; (Mirra) &#147;Uh--- this is beautiful. Where did you get it?&#148;

&#147;The little bakery near New King Penguin Park. It&#146;s been my favorite 
for years.&#148; Umi sighed, lovely memories floating up to her mind&#146;s 
eye---

She remembers all the happy times with Hikaru &amp; Fuu.

The day Fuu got married to Ferio, how beautiful they were and how Umi 
agreed to take Fuu&#146;s mother&#146;s place and give Fuu away. She felt so 
proud of her.

The day Hikaru found a stray puppy in the park, lost and hungry, and 
called the little thing &#147;Hikari&#148; after her own dog she once had.

The day Fuu invited Umi up to her winter home and taught her how to 
snowboard along with Little Hikaru and Ferio, who was only getting 
into the sport when she arrived at the slopes for the first time.

The day Hikaru came running in, happily proclaiming how she and Presea 
were getting marr---

Umi face faults. Quickly she shakes it off and turns her attention 
squarely on Mirra (much to her dismay) &#147;You&#146;re in the cheerleading 
squad right? And a great athlete. Hikaru told me often about how you 
follow in your moth--- I mean &#147;father&#148;&#146;s footsteps--- that&#146;s right, 
isn&#146;t it? &#147;Father&#148;?&#148;

&#147;Sakura-papa? Uh-huh. But I&#146;m not as good as she is.&#148;

&#147;So modest!&#148; Umi prods, &#147;Your growing up to be such a beautiful young 
woman.&#148;

&#147;----thanks---&#148;

&#147;I remember watching Hikaru and Fuu grow up, our friendship 
growing---&#148;

She once again remembers the good times.

Hikaru pouting because she hadn&#146;t grown very tall while she and Fuu 
were growing and growing.

All the crashes and accidents Ferio had while learning to snowboard.

The day Fuu tried to sub at Hikaru&#146;s school as PE teacher and was 
taken to the nurse&#146;s office after she crashed into the horse while 
trying to demonstrate a simple jump.

The day back in Cephiro when Presea gave them their new Escudo 
weapons--- and how she collapsed after giving all her energy and how 
Keiko gave back some of her spirit energy to Presea, using Hikaru as a 
conduit between the two she---

&#147;AGH!!&#148; Umi jumps up, fist banging the table. &#147;THAT&#146;S RIGHT!! KEIKO 
GOT YOU TWO TOGETHER!! THAT MEDDLESOME GOOD FOR NOTHING IS THE CAUSE 
OF THIS WITH HER &#147;OH HOLD HER&#148;, AND HER &#147;HUG HER&#148;, AND &#147;OH YOU TWO ARE 
SO CUTE&#148;!! GOD IT MAKES ME WANT TO VOMIT THINKING HOW SHE---&#148; (stops, 
blushes) &#147;---uh--- sorry--- too much sugar.&#148;

&#147;Obviously.&#148; Presea remarks blandly, drawing a harsh expression from 
Umi to which she replies &#147;Mind your blood sugar, dearie, it&#146;s peaking 
again.&#148;

&#147;-----&#148; Umi growls, only to drop her temper and return to her happy 
place. &#147;Uh--- how&#146;s the cake?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s great, thank you.&#148; Mirra smiles, recovering herself from the 
shock, taking another bite.

&#147;Ummm---- Umi-papa? Why--- why don&#146;t you like Presea?&#148;

Silence. Umi turns to look at Hikaru, and yet can&#146;t bring herself to 
speak. For a few seconds she just looks back and forth, a look of 
confusion, then irritation on her face. &#147;I&#146;m sorry. I didn&#146;t mean---&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s OK. I---&#148; (sighs as she sits back down) &#147;---I guess I always 
thought Hikaru was cut out for a boyfriend. Maybe find a cute guy and 
she&#146;d be his knight in shining armor instead of the other way around, 
and she&#146;s ride off into the sunset with him clinging onto her and 
they&#146;d live happily ever after.&#148;

&#147;Was it so horrible that she fell in love with me?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s more like it might not have happened!&#148; Umi spat out, turning her 
gaze onto Presea. &#147;If Keiko didn&#146;t interfere who knows who she might 
have ended up with! How things might have ended up for all of us! We 
might still have our families at this time of year to celebrate with! 
We might---&#148; (gasps)

&#147;---be happier if she never took us here, and gave us a chance that we 
might never have had if we stood dead--- is that it?&#148;

Umi collapses into her chair, the weight of an invisible burden 
pushing down on her as she leans forward onto the table. &#147;I didn&#146;t ask 
for this! I didn&#146;t want to never see mama or papa ever again! I didn&#146;t 
want it to happen like this!&#148;

&#147;But look at all the good that came from it!&#148; Presea argued, taking 
her turn to stand up over Umi, &#147;You two have a beautiful daughter, 
whose in love which a great woman. Fuu and Ferio are so happy 
together, and Hikaru is the happiest I ever seen her even back in 
Cephiro!&#148; she lets a few seconds pass, as Hikaru leans forward to 
comfort Umi, before speaking again. &#147;I wish each of you could have had 
everything you wanted, but isn&#146;t it enough that you&#146;re happy, and are 
like a family to each other? I know it would have been beautiful if 
each of you had family to spend Christmas with--- but your family to 
each other--- can&#146;t spending Christmas together make up for that? 
Can&#146;t we have a happy Christmas together and be family to each other?&#148;

For the longest time Umi does not say a word. She simply stares into 
the table head lowered. Finally, with a little help from Hikaru, she 
slowly stands up. She shakes aside the long strands of her hair from 
her face, and she stares Presea straight in the eye. Seconds pass---

&#147;You better not let that pest Mokona run rampant or so help me you&#146;re 
going to become the black sheep of the family faster than I can say 
&#147;fencing foil&#148;!&#148;

The two come together, their arms wrapping around tight as they 
embrace, Presea smiling abit as she hugs Umi. &#147;You&#146;re a pushover 
whenever Hikaru brings Mokona over, you know that.&#148;

&#147;Only because I don&#146;t have the heart to tell her what I&#146;d like to do 
with her &#147;friend&#148; if I had---&#148; the phone in her pocket rings, quickly 
she takes it out and answers it. &#147;Uh-huh. Yeah--- oh. Oh, great. Ok. 
Hold on a second---&#148; (she turns to Hikaru &amp; Mirra) &#147;I&#146;m sorry, but I 
got to take this.&#148;

Hikaru looked disappointed for a second, but quickly smiles. &#147;No 
problem. We&#146;ll be in my room where I&#146;ll be showing Mirra the--- 
you-know-what.&#148;

&#147;Ok.&#148; Umi replies, watching the two walk away hand in hand, 
realization setting in. &#147;YOU TWO GOTTA STAY FOR DINNER!! MY TREAT!! 
HIKARU &amp; FUU WILL BE THERE!!&#148;

&#147;OK! Thanks!&#148;

Presea, one eye arched upward in surprise, looks at Umi with a 
skeptical gaze. &#147;Guilty conscious?&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t get it, do you--- and you think your so smart.&#148; she remarks 
with a bit of pride, going back to talking on the phone leaving Presea 
to ponder what she meant.

------

The sight that greeted them when they got to the room stunned Mirra 
into silence.

She had wanted to know on the way up the stairs what Hikaru meant, but 
it wasn&#146;t until they got to the door, and she opened it with a &#147;See 
for yourself&#148; that she got a good idea what was going on.

In the bed, lying next to each other, was Kerberos and--- &#147;Cloud?&#148; 
Mirra whispered, leaning forward to look at the girl closely. It had 
to be Cloud. Last month Rain was captured (Note - see upcoming Card 
Captor Sakura Remastered II &frac12; series for details) so this had to be 
the Cloud. She was still the same old Cloud though. Nothing changed in 
that respect. Soon her inquiring mind turned to the other problem.

&#147;It&#146;s this.&#148; Hikaru motioned, leading Mirra to the closet where she 
found inside---

&#147;A &#147;Treasure&#148; Box?&#148; Mirra asked, picking up the ornate miniature 
treasure chest and looking at it, a strangely familiar sense coming 
over her. &#147;I know what&#146;s wrong.&#148; She announces, turning back only to 
come to a dead halt. &#147;W-wh-what are you---?&#148;

&#147;Tomoyo-chan said I should record all your brave moments so we&#146;d 
remember them forever.&#148; Hikaru cheerfully announced, holding a 
camcorder (obviously a gift from Tomoyo) in her hand.

&#145;Tomoyo-mama! What are you teaching her?!?&#146; Mirra thinks as she 
blushes. Quickly recovering from the shock, she moves the box over to 
a table, and takes a few steps back. &#147;There&#146;s a Clow Card in there. I 
know which one it is too.&#148;

&#147;Uh---&#148; (Hikaru) &#147;---did you bring Sakura&#146;s staff?&#148;

&#147;Actually---&#148; Mirra holds her hand out, releasing a swarm of glass 
shards which gather near her hand, then fall outwards upwards and down 
to form the rough shape of the staff. &#147;I&#146;ve been practicing with my 
powers for awhile now---&#148; Slowly, as she grips her hand tight, the 
shards close together, melting into each other, to form a crystal 
clear replica of the staff itself. As Hikaru watches in amazement, the 
replica solidifies until it&#146;s an exact copy of the original.

&#147;You never told me about it---&#148; Hikaru whispered, only to feel Mirra&#146;s 
free hand on her cheek, raising her face up to stare into her eyes. &#147;I 
did it once before, a long time ago--- remember? And I didn&#146;t want to 
worry you if you thought I might have some foolish notion in my 
head---&#148; she whispers.

The two stand there, allowing the brief moment to pass as Hikaru 
relished the touch of Mirra&#146;s hand, until she at last pulls away and 
walks over to the box. &#147;Watch.&#148;

She motions forward with the staff, and taps at the box, the bird&#146;s 
head coming into contact with a strong force field around the box as 
it does. &#147;See? It&#146;s obviously Shield---&#148;

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Mirra stops. &#147;---did you do that?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; she responded in surprise, turning to look at the box. &#147;Maybe it 
Shield?&#148;

Mirra turns back to the box, hesitant, &#147;Shield doesn&#146;t usually make 
noises---&#148; Carefully she reaches out the staff head again, tapping the 
force field causing the field to flare up around the box again. &#147;----&#148;

Tap. Tap. Tap.

&#147;Is there--- maybe another card in the box?&#148; Hikaru asked, to which 
Mirra could only reply &#147;I wish we could ask Kero but once he&#146;s 
sleeping it&#146;s hard to wake him. There&#146;s one way to find out---&#148;

She raises the staff high, the form becoming clear again as the glass 
form reshapes into the form of Sword, solidifying once again. Mirra 
briefly shudders as she takes hold of Sword. &#147;Are you alright?&#148;

&#147;Yes. It&#146;s just a little drain---&#148; Mirra takes a swing with Sword, 
breaking the shield over the box and reverting it back to it&#146;s 
original form. Once again another shift back to the first form, which 
staggers Mirra abit, almost sending her to her knees. Mirra quickly 
waves Hikaru off before she rushes forward. &#147;It&#146;s OK. It takes abit 
out of me--- to shift this part of my soul--- back and forth into 
different--- forms---&#148; she assures her, holding the staff out now. 
&#147;Clow Card, return to your powers confined! Shield card!&#148;

She jams the staff forward, as energy reaches out of the end and grabs 
Shield, converting it back into it&#146;s card form. As it returns to her 
hand, Mirra stumbles to her knees, Hikaru racing up to catch her. 
&#147;What&#146;s wrong? Mirra-chan? What&#145;s---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s exhausting---&#148; she gasped, allowing Hikaru to move her to the 
bed where Kero and Cloud were sleeping, laying her down on her side as 
she kneels next to her. &#147;For Sakura-papa, the staff taps into it&#146;s own 
power until it evolves again when sealing cards. Only when papa is 
converting cards into Star Cards will it draw upon her own power. But 
my mirror &#147;staff&#148; is an extension of my soul, so it automatically taps 
my spirit energy whenever I reshape it or mirror a power or ability. 
So, everytime I use a new power, or seal a card, it takes energy from 
me--- tires me out. I&#145;ll get it back soon, but--- I&#145;m just tired.&#148;

&#147;Mirra-chan---&#148; Hikaru whispers, her hand gently caressing Mirra&#146;s 
face as she lies on the bed, bringing a weak grin from her, &#147;You&#146;re 
just too good for me---&#148; she sighed. Behind them, the box pops open 
and something comes out with a slight jingling chiming noise. Hikaru 
turns around quickly, moving to defend Mirra, but finds herself face 
to face with an odd sight--- a small fairy, wings glowing , fluttering 
in front of her. The small little female smiles, easing Hikaru&#146;s 
tensions, as she lands on her shoulder.

She was beautiful. She had long limbs which moved gracefully as she 
came to land upon Hikaru&#146;s shoulder, the little fairy slowly walking 
up towards her face with graceful steps. Her hand was small, and 
delicate looking, it&#146;s touch soft as it reached up to touch Hikaru 
where Mirra touched her earlier.

Hikaru took in a deep breath and felt her energy as she smiled at her 
gently. For long seconds the hand caressed her cheek, calming her, 
until she finally moved and kissed her before moving to Mirra.

The kiss was a soft peck, but it carried a great deal of soothing 
energy which filled Hikaru&#146;s body and seemingly lifted a few weeks 
worth of burden and concern from her all at once.

Next, the little fairy moved towards Mirra. Mirra, feeling the 
presence, rolls over onto her back. Her eyes comes onto the little one 
as she touches down on her near her face. &#147;I don&#146;t--- remember you---&#148; 
she whispers, to which the fairy nods her head. She walks up to 
Mirra&#146;s face, touching Mirra&#146;s lips, then moving her hands along the 
face. After long seconds she smiles, and with an unspoken 
understanding between herself and Mirra she lays herself down on 
Mirra&#145;s chest. Her eyes flutter abit, and then close--- her body at 
first glows a little, then slowly sinks into Mirra&#146;s, her tiny form 
vanishing as Mirra feels her body recover it&#146;s strength bringing her 
back up to a sitting position. As she checks herself she feels a warm 
feeling course through her body.

&#147;Wh-what--- what was---&#148;

&#147;Hope--- I think.&#148; Mirra responds, smiling the same infectious smile 
that the little fairy smiled a minute before. &#147;I heard Kero mention a 
card called Hope but never remembered that card. It must have been 
something unique to Sakura-papa----&#148; (sighs) &#147;---she gave me new 
strength--- and hope--- something we&#146;ll be needing in the days to come 
I think.&#148;

Mirra didn&#146;t say another word after that. She simply pulled the now 
inquisitive Hikaru into her arms and kissed her before the questions 
began, the two falling into the bed and cuddling without saying 
another word, Hikaru&#146;s questions forgotten for now.

Seconds later Mirra suddenly remembered the two slumbering forms next 
to her, and came up with a thought. A thought which became an idea--- 
&#147;I have an idea.&#148;

&#147;Ok--- let me get the camera and check the footage.&#148;

&#147;?!?&#148; (Mirra nearly faints, which wouldn&#146;t have made for much of an 
impact because she was already on her back) &#147;Oh beautiful! The entire 
scene with Hope came out great! The auto zoom worked perfectly! 
Tomoyo-chan is going to be so happy to see this!&#148;

&#147;----Tomoyo-mama---&#148; Mirra sighed, realizing that she and Sakura-papa 
were soon going to have more in common than they ever realized was 
possible.

------

Back at the Daidouji estates---

The holochamber beneath the house.

&#147;That&#146;s so beautiful!&#148; Tomoyo cried, watching the scene between Hope 
and Mirra as the film slowly drew to a close. Mirra, sitting next to 
Sakura, was blushing bright red. &#147;Tomoyo-mama---&#148;

&#147;I know the feeling.&#148; Sakura whispers to her, the two sighing as the 
film progressed.

&#147;This is my favorite part.&#148; Hikaru points out as Mirra stands over 
Cloud and smiles. &#147;Cloud, return your powers to me--- and be free. 
Cloud card!&#148;

&#147;Why did you do that?!?&#148; Kero complained from his perch on top of 
Cloud&#146;s head, the young girl kicking her legs in the air as she 
watched. &#147;Rain was sealed, why not Cloud here?&#148;

&#147;Rain bad! I&#146;m good!&#148; Cloud complained, kicking her feet more.

&#147;Because I remember when you were Big Kero,&#148; Mirra began, edging 
towards the two, &#147;---and Cloud said when she was a big girl you and 
her would get married!&#148;

&#147;---Kero-chan---&#148; Sakura whispered, her lips raising up into a big 
smile, which Kero quickly caught onto, &#147;Oh NO! No you don&#146;t! Don&#146;t you 
dare start gloating at me! No! No! No!&#148;

&#147;You never told me Cloud was your girlfriend!&#148;

&#147;Cloud is NOT my girlfriend! She&#146;s a girl and she&#146;s a friend but she&#146;s 
not---&#148;

Nina - &#147;Did you know that denial is a river in Egypt?&#148;

Eliza - &#147;?&#148;

&#147;I heard that once! Bad pun!&#148; Kero spat out, &#147;Who told you that?&#148;

&#147;Makoto did. It&#146;s her weak ass one liner she used on Ami once when she 
wouldn&#146;t try out---mmp&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t want to hear that story.&#148; Eliza jumps in, hand covering 
Nina&#146;s mouth.

Tomoyo, in her chair, sighs as the scene changes. Her attention still 
focused on the film---

&#147;So why did she move into your room? Do you two have a secret naughty 
relat---&#148;

&#147;SHE&#146;S A LITTLE KID, KOTOBUKI!!&#148; Kero glared at the green haired girl 
(who managed to get Eliza&#146;s hand off her mouth), his wings flapping 
furiously as he stared at her angrily. &#147;GET YOUR SICK MIND OUT OF THE 
GUTTER!!!&#148;

-----

That night, as Christmas drew close, everyone had a party and 
celebrated Christmas Eve.

But that&#146;s a story for Card Captor Sakura Remastered.

It&#146;s now 1AM, and for the first time in awhile both Mirra and Hikaru 
are sleeping comfortably.

No more fears keeping them up, not while hope keeps their spirits 
strong within both of them.

&#147;I know what you came here for---&#148; Umi remarked, Hikaru&#146;s thoughts 
floating back to when they were invited to eat dinner. &#147;You want to 
stay with her, don&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry---&#148; Hikaru whispered, kicking her feet nervously, &#147;But I 
love her--- I want to stay with Mirra-chan--- forever. I---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll have your stuff sent over after Christmas.&#148; Umi replied, kissing 
Hikaru on the forehead. &#147;If your sure she&#146;s the one for you then I 
won&#146;t stand in your way--- just don&#146;t be too quick to grow up.&#148;

&#147;I won&#146;t.&#148;

Hikaru rolls over in her sleep, a small glass statue of an angel sits 
within a protective glass case on the nightstand. Her precious 
treasure amongst her trinkets and baubles which Shield was protecting.

She still remembers when she got it.

It was a day which seemed like forever. When she had only known Mirra 
for a few days.

That day they were on a field trip and she tripped and fell down a few 
stairs which caused some of the students to laugh at her. She was 
still nursing her bruised knee and hurt feelings while everyone ate 
lunch when Mirra walked up to her. &#147;Can I sit here, Hikaru? We can eat 
lunch together.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not hungry.&#148; she whispered, only to feel Mirra take one of her 
hands and place something cold in it. Inside her hand was a 
beautifully sculpted glass angel. &#147;---Mirra---?&#148;

&#147;They were being mean to you, and I wanted to cheer you up, so--- I 
hope it&#146;s OK with you. It&#146;s not much, but it&#146;s---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s beautiful--- are you---&#148;

Mirra nods her head quickly, opening her lunch and offering to share. 
The two spent the entire lunch swapping food, talking, and laughing--- 
and that&#146;s how it all began for the two of them.

Upon reflection? It seemed to her that the angel was far more precious 
than she ever thought possible--- after seeing what Mirra could do--- 
she realized then and there that this was more than a gift to soothe 
her hurt feelings. It was a piece of her soul she gave her that day.

Which she hoped one day to return in full to Mirra when their day 
finally came.

One day. When they were ready. But for now--- they had all the time in 
the world.
