<h1>Love Forever (part 4 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>They called Fujitaka and asked him if he wanted to come to dinner. When 
he heard that Sakura was back in town, he insisted that they come over 
there to eat. Touya and Yukito also accepted the Invitation and said 
they would meet them there. When they arrived, everyone helped cook 
dinner and sat down to eat. While they were eating, Touya asked where 
the Gaki was and why Sakura wasn&#39;t with him. She filled them in on what 
happened and everyone except Tomoyo got upset.

&quot;I&#39;ll kill him!&quot; Yelled Fujitaka.

&quot;Not before me!&quot; Touya retorted.

&quot;Now, now, calm down you two.&quot; Said Yukito in a calming tone. &quot;Besides, 
I&#39;m the one that he&#39;s going to have to worry about.&quot;

Everyone was standing and yelling about who was going to be the one to 
exact their wrath on Sayoran. Dinner finished and everyone told Sakura 
they were happy she was back as they left. When they got back to 
Tomoyo&#39;s, Sakura said that she was going to take a bath and wanted to 
ask Tomoyo something when she was done. Tomoyo said that was fine and 
that she would make some snacks and pop in a movie for when Sakura came 
out. When she was done, Sakura came out and sat next to Tomoyo on the 
couch.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Do you still love me?&quot;

&quot;Of course I do! You know that! I&#39;ll love you with all my heart for as 
long as I live. Even if that means you fall in love with someone else. 
As long as you&#39;re happy... I&#39;m happy.&quot;

Sakura leaned over and gave Tomoyo a quick kiss on the lips. Tomoyo 
paused for a minute and asked why Sakura kissed her.

&quot;Never mind. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just... when we were kids, you always said that you loved me. I 
thought you meant as a friend but... you&#39;re love for me has always been 
alot deeper than that hasn&#39;t it Tomoyo?&quot;

Tomoyo blushed as she thought about what Sakura said.

&quot;Uh... uh-huh.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all I needed to know.&quot;

Tomoyo looked up with tears in her eyes and pleaded with Sakura not to 
hate her. Sakura just sat there looking striaght ahead while Tomoyo put 
her face in her hands and started crying. Sakura pulled Tomoyo&#39;s hands 
away from her face and looked into her eyes.

&quot;I don&#39;t hate you! Why would you ever think that! I love you too 
Tomoyo-chan!&quot;

Tomoyo sniffled and thought that Sakura was just trying to comfort her. 
Sakura brought her chin up and said: &quot;I mean it Tomoyo-chan... I love 
you.&quot; She leaned in and gave Tomoyo another kiss on the lips. This one 
deeper and more passionate.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan... I feel like everyone has abandoned me. But, you&#39;ve stuck 
by me. Even while I was in love and in Hong Kong, you still loved me and 
wished for my happiness didn&#39;t you? You&#39;re the one I should have loved 
in the first place. Tomoyo-chan... will you marry me?&quot;

&quot;YES! Of course Sakura!&quot; She glomped Sakura and kissed her. Leaving 
lipstick all over her face.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get used to all of your love Tomoyo-chan. I 
don&#39;t deserve you.&quot;

&quot;Of course you do Sakura!&quot; She said while glomping her again.

Tomoyo stepped back, looked at Sakura and laughed. Sakura just got a 
puzzled look on her face. &quot;Hoe...?&quot; Tomoyo kept laughing and pointed to 
a mirror on the wall nearby.

Sakura looked at her reflection and blushed a crimson that almost 
matched the lipstick covering her face. She laughed and pulled out her 
handkerchief to wipe off the lipstick. She looked back at Tomoyo, who 
had her Camcorder in her left hand and a wide eyed starry look.

&quot;Sakura-chan is just too cute! I can&#39;t wait to see her in her new 
Wedding dress I&#39;m going to make! And I can&#39;t wait until I see her in 
nothing!&quot; Tomoyo says while slowly rubbing her Camcorder.

&quot;Hoeeeeee.&quot;

Tomoyo and Sakura stayed up late that night, talking about the hopes and 
dreams they had for their new life together. They talked about Love, 
Fear, Lonliness, and the sheer bliss they were feeling now that they 
were together. They even discussed the possibility of having children.

&quot;Ohhhhh. I would love to have a child with you Sakura! Even though we&#39;re 
both girls, I&#39;m sure that we could find someone to help us. Maybe we 
could get Yukito or your brother to donate their sperm.&quot;

&quot;Hoeeeeeee. No way! I&#39;m not going to carry a child who&#39;s life came from 
my brother!&quot;

&quot;Who says you would have to be the one to have the baby? Why can&#39;t I? It 
doesn&#39;t matter to me who the baby comes from. Besides, Yukito or your 
brother would be perfect. We wouldn&#39;t have to worry about screening or 
anything.&quot;
