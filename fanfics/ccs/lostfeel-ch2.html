Nani: what

*thought*
&quot;dialog&quot;
&lt;dream&gt;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tomoyo was doing the same thing she did for all those years of
loneliness: cleaning up the old and abandoned bedroom where Sakura
used to sleep when they were kids. She cleaned up Sakura&#39;s bed
thinking of how many times she tried to show the brown-haired girl how
much she cared about her. She did everything to make Sakura happy,
don&#39;t matter how! She helped Sakura and Syaoran to get together, she
was so happy to see her love smiling again, but that was also the most
painful moment of her life: when Sakura first kissed Syaoran. Tomoyo
would give her life to be in his place! But how could she be so
selfish now? She had never been like that before! *Sakura, I hope
you&#39;re ok..* But she knew she wasn&#39;t ok. Tomoyo could feel it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sakura: &quot;Kero-chan...I decided to quit it.&quot;

Sakura always thought she would feel sad if she said it, but she
wasn&#39;t. This feeling of tranquility caught her in surprise.

Kero: &quot;NANIIIIII? you MUST be kidding me, Sakura! Don&#39;t you love that
brat? Don&#39;t you wanna find him anymore?&quot;

Sakura looked at nothing..she found herself in deep thought, took a
long breath and smiled.

Sakura: &quot;I don&#39;t know how I feel about him anymore.&quot;

A tear came down her face.

Kero: &quot;How come you don&#39;t know something like that?! You loved him so
much! You&#39;ve been looking for him for such long years! You ignored
your family, you ignored your friends...You ignored Tomoyo...&quot;

Sakura: &quot;I know, Kero-chan..&quot;

Sakura and Kero fell asleep.

...&lt;..voice: &quot;Sakura-chan..You finally realized your true
feelings...I&#39;m sorry...I had to leave you...I&#39;m not your true love, I
wasn&#39;t the right one for you...Now you got to find the one who holds
your heart, who really cared about you for all this time...Thank you
for thinking of me, I&#39;ll never forget you...&quot; She saw a dark-haired
girl crying and a very familiar smell came...&quot;Tomoyo-chan..&quot; she said
&quot;I miss you so much..What did you really mean behind those words..?&quot;&gt;

Sakura wakes up with the phone ringing. The same phone Tomoyo gave her
when they were kids. *Ringing again...* she thought. She always felt
so good when this phone rang, it meant everything was ok with
Tomoyo. But Sakura never answered it, thinking of how many
explanations she&#39;d have to give to her friend. The phone rang almost
every day.

But this time was different. This time she wasn&#39;t feeling things were
fine. Was that dream a premonition? Is there something happening with
Tomoyo? Everything came to her mind in just one second. Sakura caught
the phone, easily, nervously...

Sakura: &quot;Mo..moshi moshi...Tomoyo-chan..&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The mirror couldn&#39;t describe Tomoyo&#39;s color. She was pale, looking
like a ghost. She couldn&#39;t say a word.

Sakura: &quot;Tomoyo-chan? Are you there..?&quot; 
Tomoyo: &quot;H..hai...&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s eyes blinked, she couldn&#39;t believe this! 
Sakura: &quot;I&#39;m going back to Tomoeda, Tomoyo-chan...&quot;
