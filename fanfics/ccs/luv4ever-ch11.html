<h1>Love Forever (part 11 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Tomoyo shot up in bed and looked around as she heard the Security alarm 
blaring in the halls. She woke her sleeping beauty and ran for the 
living room while Sakura looked for some clothes. She came out just as 
Tomoyo flipped to the Security Channel to see what was going on.

ATTENTION ATENTION: A BREACH OF BUILDING SECURITY IN THE NORTH LOBBY HAS 
BEEN DETECTED. ALL RESIDENTS ARE ASKED TO LOCK THEIR DOORS AND REMAIN 
INSIDE. A VIDEO CLIP OF THE SUSPECT WILL BE SENT TO YOUR SCREENS 
SHORTLY.

The screen switched and Tomoyo and Sakura were frozen with fear. It was 
Li. Somehow, he had escaped from prison and tracked them down. Tomoyo 
looked at the time the clip was recorded and started to panic.

&quot;Sakura! Quick, go hide in the bedroom! I&#39;ll call the Police!&quot;

Sakura did what she was asked and ran back to their room. Tomoyo ran to 
call the police as she heard him pounding on the door. She picked up the 
handset and tried to dial, but she was to scared to get the number 
right. Two more loud bangs, and the door gave way to Sayoran&#39;s strong 
legs. Tomoyo dropped the phone and tried to run to the bedroom, but was 
grabbed by the arm and spun around to see a furious Li staring at her 
with pure hatred in his eyes.

&quot;Where is she!?&quot;

Tomoyo was too afraid to answer.

&quot;Where the fuck is she!?&quot;

Tomoyo looked away as she said nothing. Li backhanded her, and she fell 
to the floor, hitting her head on the table leg. He pulled out his sword 
and started looking for Sakura. She cautiously made her way into the 
living room, clutching her staff tightly to her chest.

&quot;How dare you! Who do you think you are, leaving me!&quot;

He looked at her stomach and grew even more angry.

&quot;You bitch! You think you could keep being pregnant with my child a 
secret from me!?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not yours! This child belongs to Tomoyo-chan and me!&quot;

Sayoran was shaking with fury, and lost control.

&quot;GOD&#39;S OF THUNDER! ANSWER MY CALL!&quot; He threw his sword against a scroll 
to call forth a lightning bolt to kill Sakura. But before it struck, 
Shield came to Sakura&#39;s rescue and protected her from death. He used all 
his stregnth, and kept on attacking. Shield couldn&#39;t take much more and 
he knew this. He stopped the lightning attack and pulled out another 
scroll.

&quot;GOD&#39;S OF FIRE! ANSWER MY...&quot; He was cut off as he felt vines wrapping 
around his arms. He looked back and saw that Sakura wasn&#39;t commanding 
the Wood card to do anything. It was acting on it&#39;s own! Before he lost 
all of the movement in his legs, he kicked Sakura and knocked her to the 
ground. The rest of the cards flew into the room and were floating in 
front of him.

In the other room, Tomoyo stirred and started to regain conciousness.

&quot;You stupid clow cards! You&#39;re supposed to be mine! Not some dense, 
useless womans!&quot; Shouted Sayoran.

&quot;What makes her so great? Why do you protect her!?&quot;

Tomoyo overheard his comments and struggled to walk over to him.

&quot;Because they love her.&quot; She said.

&quot;That&#39;s stupid! They&#39;re cards! They don&#39;t love people!&quot;

Tomoyo looked around and saw Sakura laying on the ground in the doorway. 
She walked over to her and kissed her on the forehead as she whispered 
into her ear.

&quot;Sakura-chan... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

She stood up and walked over to the still struggling Li. She stood 
directly in front of him and picked up his sword. She grasped the heavy 
object in both hands and placed it on his chest.

&quot;I&#39;ll never, ever forgive you for hurting Sakura-chan. You have an evil 
heart. You don&#39;t deserve to live.&quot;

Sakura started to wake up and was listening to Tomoyo&#39;s words. She stood 
up, walked over, and hugged her tightly from behind.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan... don&#39;t. Please don&#39;t kill him. I&#39;ll be alright.&quot; She 
leaned in and kissed Tomoyo with all her love. Tomoyo started to cry as 
she turned back and looked straight into Sayoran&#39;s eyes. She pushed the 
tip of the sword into his flesh, causing him to wince and moan in pain. 
A trail of warm, red liquid trickling down his chest and seeping through 
his shirt. With cold, emotionless eyes, she said:

&quot;I want you to leave. If you ever, I mean ever come back, call us, or 
bother us or our families again, I&#39;ll spend every last bit of money and 
stregnth to hunt you down and kill you.&quot; 

Her words echoed over, and over in his head. Never had he heard such 
words from the usually calm, dark haired woman. For the first time in 
his life, he was scared. Really, truly scared. He managed to mutter a 
pathetic &#39;Yes&#39; and actually begged her to let him go. She looked to 
Sakura, and she nodded. Sakura asked Wood to release him. He looked at 
Sakura with a hateful look and Tomoyo yelled at him to get out. Police 
sirens could be heard in the backround as Li bolted out of the apartment 
and down the stairs. Tomoyo dropped the sword and threw herself into 
Sakura&#39;s arms.

&quot;Sakura-chan... I&#39;m so sorry. I couldn&#39;t do anything.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be sorry Tomoyo-chan. You did everything you could. You risked 
your life for me.&quot; 

Sakura looked at her glassy blue eyes and gave her a slow, tender kiss, 
running her fingers through Tomoyo&#39;s long, black hair. She broke the 
kiss and pulled her hand away when she felt something warm and wet on 
the back of her head.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan! Are you ok!? You&#39;re bleeding!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine Sakura-chan. Are you ok?&quot; She asked, as she wiped away some 
blood that came from Sakura&#39;s cut lip.

A police officer came in and asked if they were ok. Even though they 
said yes, he asked that they go to the Hospital just in case. With 
Sakura being pregnant, Tomoyo thought it was a good idea and helped her 
downstairs. A forensics team was called, and they combed through the 
apartment looking for evidence while the girls were at the Hospital 
being treated for their injuries. The doctor said that Sakura would need 
stitches, so Tomoyo was fixed up first. She asked if she could call 
their families before Sakura was treated. She wanted to be with her for 
support. Tomoyo called her mother and Sakura&#39;s family while the Nurse 
prepared everything. Tomoyo returned and held Sakura&#39;s hand for 
reassurance. The nurse was very gentle, and finished in no time.
