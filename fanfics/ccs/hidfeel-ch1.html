<h1>Hidden Feelings</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/overstreet.html">Clayton Overstreet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sakura dodged to the side as the wave of sand smashed into the spot
where she had been. She turned to face the sand card again, but it had
apparently changed its target. It was now headed towards Madison, who
had been video taping the capture. Madison had turned to run but the
card was quickly catching up.

Without thinking Sakura pulled out the fiery card and summoned it.
&quot;Fiery, protect Madison!&quot; The visible form of the fiery card flew ahead
quickly blocking the sand card&#39;s path. The sand card stopped and rose
up to bury the fiery card, but it let out a blast of fire directly into
the sand. Suddenly the sand fell to the ground leaving the sand card&#39;s
visible form frozen in place as a glass figurine. Sakura swung her
wand. &quot;Sand card, return to your power confined.&quot; The figurine
shattered into sand again and swirled back into its card form, then it
and the fiery card returned to her and she put it away.

Madison ran up to Sakura and hugged her. Sakura hugged her back just as
tightly. &quot;Are you alright Madison?&quot;

Madison smiled and hugged her again. &quot;Yeah, thank you. You saved my
life Sakura.&quot;

Sakura smiled, and then quickly let Madison go blushing red. &quot;Um... you
sure you are alright?&quot;

Madison smiled and nodded. &quot;And I got the whole thing on video. How did
the new costume work out?&quot;

Sakura blushed and looked down. She always thought she looked kind of
silly in some of the outfits that Madison made for her, but since
Madison always thought she looked good in them she would wear whatever
her friend came up with. &quot;It was great Madison, thanks. When we get
back to my house let&#39;s watch the video. Kero was asleep when I came so
he missed it.&quot; Madison nodded and Sakura summoned the fly card.

As they flew over the city Sakura smiled at the feeling of Madison
pressed against her back. Sakura closed her eyes enjoying the sensation
for a minute. She had been in love with Madison since they were eight
years old, but every time she tried to tell her she balked. The closest
she had ever come was when they were kids. Madison had told Sakura that
she loved her, but when Sakura said she loved her too Madison had said
something about telling her when she was older and then dragged her off
to the fair grounds. That was when Sakura had realized that Madison
would never see her as anything more than a friend.

&quot;Madison, are you sure you want to keep video taping the Clow cards?
You were almost killed today.&quot; Sakura said.

Madison smiled and hugged her from behind. &quot;Of course I do. Besides if
anything happened to you and I wasn&#39;t there to help I could never
forgive myself.&quot;

Sakura smiled and nodded. &quot;I just don&#39;t want you to get hurt. If you
did I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do.&quot;

Madison nodded and pressed closer to Sakura. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Sakura, with
you there to protect me what could happen?&quot; Sakura blushed at how tight
Madison was holding on. What she wanted to do was turn around and kiss
her friend. But if she did that it might scare Madison so that she
wouldn&#39;t like her any more. Heck it scared Sakura that she felt that
way at all some times.

As they flew Sakura spotted Lee and Maylin standing on a roof looking
around. She told the fly card to land near them. She and Madison
stepped off and smiled at them. &quot;Hey Lee, Maylin. What are you two
doing?&quot;

Lee frowned and looked at her. &quot;We were going after the sand card, but
you beat us to it.&quot;

Maylin stood next to Lee and nodded. &quot;Lee probably could have caught
the card a lot better than you did.&quot;

Sakura smiled at them, then looked at Lee. &quot;We were going back to my
place to watch Maylin&#39;s video tape of the capture. Do you two want to
come?&quot; Lee looked at Maylin who just shrugged. Then he turned back and
nodded.

Sakura smiled, but was inwardly cursing herself. She had hoped that Lee
would say no so she could have some time with Madison and had only
asked to be polite. Oh well, at least Madison would be there. She
summoned they fly card again and used the float card to pull Lee and
Maylin behind them as they flew off towards Sakura&#39;s house.

Madison sighed as she sat on Sakura&#39;s couch watching the tape. She had
been more than a little jealous when Sakura had invited Lee with them.
She wanted to spend time alone with Sakura. Lately she had been getting
up enough courage to tell her friend how she felt about her. Sakura
saving her life like that made it seem like it would have been the
perfect time and so romantic.

She glanced down the couch at the others. Lee was besides her watching
with interest. Maylin was sitting between her and Sakura. For some
reason Maylin seemed to think Sakura and Lee liked each other. Maybe
they did. Maybe Sakura and Lee would get married, move away and leave
Madison and Maylin to grow old and live with cats. If she did though
Madison had sworn she would try to be happy for her. She glanced at
Kero who had fallen asleep on the couch arm next to her. At least
someone was carefree.

Turning back to the movie she saw the wall of Sand being blocked by the
fiery card. Hearing Sakura send it to protect her had made her heart
swoon, despite her terror. For a brief moment on the tape she saw
Sakura watching her nervously not even glancing at the fighting Clow
cards. Maybe there was hope after all.

Sakura glanced at Madison and saw her sitting by Lee smiling
pleasantly. Did Madison like Lee? Sakura felt a slight pain at that.
Then she shook her head. If Madison liked Lee that was all right. It
wasn&#39;t like she was hers or anything. Just because she had always been
there for Sakura didn&#39;t mean she always would and that was all right.

&quot;Sakura, why are you crying?&quot; Maylin asked.

Sakura put her hand to her cheek and noticed that a tear had trickled
out. She quickly wiped it away and smiled. &quot;No reason, I was just
thinking of something else.

Sakura noticed Madison and Lee looking at her too. &quot;I said I&#39;m fine.&quot;
Lee shrugged and looked back at the screen just as Sakura sealed the
card. But Madison kept looking at her.

&quot;Sakura, do you think I could stay the night this weekend? Tomorrow is
Friday after all.&quot; Madison asked a tad nervously.

Sakura nodded and smiled. &quot;That would be great Madison. Bring some
videos for us to watch too ok?&quot; Madison nodded and they both felt a bit
better as the tape ended.

Maylin and Lee got up to leave. &quot;Great capture Sakura.&quot; Lee said as he
walked out. Maylin frowned and shot Sakura a dirty look. Once they were
gone Madison decided that she had better go to.

Sakura asked if she needed a ride. &quot;No, that&#39;s alright. I called my mom
and she&#39;ll be here in five minutes. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow on the way to
school alright Sakura?&quot;

Sakura smiled and said, &quot;Sure thing Madison. I can barely wait.&quot; Just
then there was a knock on the door. She opened it and Madison&#39;s mother
was there. As she closed the door behind them Sakura leaned against it
and sank to the floor. Maybe this weekend she could tell Madison how
she felt. She just had to figure out how.

Kero floated through the air next to her. &quot;So you haven&#39;t told her yet
huh? You humans make this stuff so complicated.&quot;

Sakura shot him a look. &quot;Oh you be quiet.&quot;

Madison lay back in her room looking around herself at the pictures and
drawings hung on her walls. All were of Sakura of course. Madison kept
every picture she had taken of her since they met. Everything Sakura
had given her she had in a special box in her closet. Even that dumb
pencil she had given her to do her math with.

Madison decided to design a new costume for Sakura to wear. Maybe
something a bit more form fitting than usual. Kind of like that cat
costume only different. As she drew out her idea she smiled and
carefully drew out Sakura&#39;s face. She never forgot a single detail no
matter how much time it too.

About an hour later her mother came in. &quot;It&#39;s time for you to go to bed
now Madison.&quot; Madison smiled and put her pencil down and got into bed.

As her mother turned to leave Madison asked her. &quot;Mom, what&#39;s something
you give someone so that they know you like them.&quot;

Her mother turned back and smiled. &quot;Do you have a crush on someone
Madison?&quot; Madison nodded.

Her mother smiled and said, &quot;Well then I suggest something with hearts
and straight forward. If you are too subtle they may not get it.&quot; She
sat down on the end of her daughter&#39;s bed. &quot;Can you keep a secret?&quot;
Madison nodded. &quot;A long time ago I had a crush on Sakura&#39;s mother. I
didn&#39;t act on it and she eventually married Sakura&#39;s father. I always
regretted I never told her. Do you understand?&quot;

Madison nodded and looked at the picture of her and Sakura she kept by
her bed. Then she looked back at her mother. &quot;Do you think I have a
chance?&quot;

Her mother grabbed the locket that she always wore around her neck.
Madison had never seen inside it, but she could now guess whose picture
it was. &quot;I know that if you don&#39;t try you&#39;ll never know.&quot; Madison
leaned forward and hugged her mom. Her mom hugged her back then turned
to leave. As she did Madison smiled and lay back, thinking about what
her mother had said. Whether or no she lost Sakura this weekend didn&#39;t
seem to matter any more. She had to tell her how she felt and take what
was coming.

Sakura smiled as the bell rang to signal the end of the school day.
Miss Mackenzie didn&#39;t have any homework for them this weekend but on
the way out she smiled at Sakura. Sakura smiled back and left the room.
Madison was right behind her. &quot;So does your mom know you are come over
to my house or should we call her?&quot; Sakura asked.

Madison smiled. &quot;Yeah she knows, but I want to pick something up from
my house first ok? I&#39;ll meet you at your place in about an hour
alright?&quot;

Sakura smiled and nodded. This would be the perfect chance to find a
gift for Madison. As her friend disappeared around the corner Sakura
took off running into town. Looking around she tried to think what
would be the perfect thing to get Madison. Then she saw the Hallmark
store. &quot;I&#39;ll get her a card.&quot; Sakura smiled and giggled. Maybe after
this Madison wouldn&#39;t like her anymore, but she&#39;d rather give it a
chance than never know. Sakura quickly went inside and looked around
for a while. When she felt she had the perfect card she left to head
back home, slipping the card into her backpack.

When she got home Madison was just arriving. &quot;What took you so long
Sakura?&quot; Madison asked.

Sakura smiled. &quot;I just thought I&#39;d take the long way home. Did you get
what you needed from your house?&quot;

Madison nodded and held up her backpack. &quot;Yeah, I needed to get some
video tapes.&quot; And a card, she mentally added.

Sakura smiled and went to open the door. As she did Tory stepped out.
&quot;Hey squirt, I&#39;m going out of town to got over to a friend&#39;s house
tonight. Dad called and said he&#39;d be home Sunday from that trip he had
to take. Think you&#39;ll be alright by yourself tonight?&quot;

Sakura nodded, &quot;Yeah, Madison is spending the night and we&#39;re going to
watch some movies.&quot; Tory nodded and walked past them.

Sakura smiled and opened the door so they could go inside. When she did
she called out to Kero. &quot;We&#39;re home!&quot;

Kero came flying down the stairs. &quot;It&#39;s about time, I&#39;m starving!&quot;
Sakura and Madison giggled. Madison went to the living room to set up
the videos while Sakura went to the kitchen with Kero. Once they were
there Sakura got a sandwich out of the fridge for him. &quot;So are you
going to tell her tonight?&quot;

Sakura blushed and shushed him. &quot;She might hear you. And yes I&#39;m going
to tell her. I don&#39;t suppose you would mind sleeping on the couch
tonight would you?&quot;

Kero rubbed his chin. &quot;Ok, if you will give me a piece of that cake
that&#39;s sitting in the refrigerator.&quot;

Sakura nodded. &quot;Deal.&quot;

Madison yawned as she changed into the nightshirt she had brought with
her. She and Sakura had spent hours watching some of Madison&#39;s video
collection then had traded stories of what had been happening in school
lately. Finally they had decided to go to bed. Sakura had already
changed and was in bed with her eyes closed. Madison slipped into the
covers with her card hidden in her hand. She turned and smiled at
Sakura. &quot;Goodnight.&quot;

Sakura turned to her. &quot;Goodnight Madison.&quot; She yawned and turned back
closing her eyes again. Madison smiled and looked over her face. Sakura
was even more beautiful asleep... no she corrected herself. Nothing
could make Sakura any more beautiful. She smiled and lay back waiting
for Sakura to fall asleep.

Sakura however was anything but sleepy. She was so nervous she could
barely keep her eyes closed. She had slipped her card to Madison under
her friend&#39;s pillow and was waiting for her to find it. . After a while
she turned and glanced at Madison who was still awake. Madison smiled
at her. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Can&#39;t sleep?&quot;

Sakura smiled, &quot;I think... I think I need a drink of water. Do you want
any?&quot; Madison shook her head. Once Sakura got up she quickly slipped
the card under Sakura&#39;s pillow and grinned.

After Sakura got back both of them were awake for quite some time, but
pretending to sleep has a tendency to turn into real sleep and
eventually they were both out.

The next morning Sakura yawned and stretched. Suddenly her hand came in
contact with something under her pillow. She picked it up and saw that
it was the card she had left for Madison. She bit her lip and choked
back a sob, then turned to look at her friend&#39;s sleeping face. So...
she had decided not to embarrass Sakura. Sakura hadn&#39;t thought she
could love her any more but now she did. It hurt that Madison had
basically said no to her, but it was apparent hat she still waned to be
friends.

Sakura got up, still carrying the card and went downstairs to the
kitchen. She would make Madison a breakfast to remember to make up to
her. On the way she saw Kero asleep on the couch and smiled. &quot;I should
have listened to him.&quot;

Madison woke up to the smell of sausages and pancakes. As she slid out
of bed her finger caught on something under her pillow. It was the card
she had left for Sakura. Madison smiled. So that was why she was making
breakfast, to show that they were still friends. Madison picked up her
card and turned to walk down stairs. Sakura was such a good person.

When she got to the bottom of the stairs she saw Kero still asleep on
the couch. She was actually quite surprised. Usually Kero was the fist
one at the table and the last to leave. Oh well, maybe Sakura had used
the sleep card on him.

Madison walked into the kitchen. &quot;Hmm, that smells wonderful Sakura.&quot;

Sakura smiled and looked at her. &quot;Thanks Madison. It should be done in
a little bit.&quot;

Madison smiled and put the card on the table beside her. Sakura
finished cooking and turned to put the food on the table. She saw the
card there and blushed, looking up at Madison. &quot;Look, about that... I
understand how you feel.&quot;

Madison smiled at her and nodded. &quot;I know Sakura. It&#39;s just...&quot; She
looked down.

Sakura smiled at her. &quot;It&#39;s ok, I just thought you should know.&quot; She
looked around the room, then her gaze stopped in surprise.

Madison looked up and saw her staring, then turned to see what she was
looking at. On the counter was a card identical to the one by her hand.
Sakura and Madison turned to look at each other, then at he card on the
table, then back at the one on the counter. Sakura quickly jumped out
of her seat, knocking the chair to the ground, and ran to grab the card
off the counter. At the same time Madison grabbed the one off of the
table.

Sakura opened the card. Inside was the same message she had seen at the
store: I love you more than anyone else in the world and I want you to
be mine. But at the bottom, instead of her name was Madison&#39;s. She
turned to Madison who was looking at the card in her hand in growing
shock. &quot;But... but I thought...&quot; Madison looked up at Sakura with her
jaw hanging down slightly.

Sakura walked slowly to her seat and picked the chair up and sat down
quietly, still staring at the card in her hand. After a few minutes she
looked up to Madison who was smiling at her and had tears in her eyes.
Sakura saw this and smiled back as a tear dripped down her own cheek.
Then suddenly Sakura started to laugh. Madison giggled and put her hand
over her mouth. Finally they stopped, but neither of them was quite
sure what to say.

Sakura looked down at the card again, going over the words in her mind.
Madison smiled and watched Sakura&#39;s face. Then Sakura looked up at her
and whispered a single word. &quot;Yes...&quot;

Madison&#39;s heart leapt into her throat. She took a deep breath and
nodded. &quot;Me too Sakura.&quot; Slowly she and Sakura got up from the table
and smiled at each other. Sakura took the first step, but before they
knew it they were in each other&#39;s arms, each holding onto the other one
as if they were afraid it was only a dream.

Sakura and Madison eventually loosened their grip and pulled back
slightly to look into each other&#39;s eyes. Both of them were smiling, and
both had tears in their eyes. Madison closed her eyes and leaned her
head closer to Sakura. Slightly surprised Sakura realized what was
happening and met Madison half way in a kiss that sent shivers through
her spine.

When they broke apart both of them started talking at the same time.
Phrases like &quot;I thought you didn&#39;t want to be more than friends.&quot; and
&quot;I love you so much.&quot; could be heard occasionally. They both told the
other that they had been in love since they were young, but had thought
the other one had only wanted to be friends. Sakura smiled and shook
her head. &quot;Let&#39;s promise never to keep something like this from each
other again alright Madison?&quot;

Madison smiled and nodded. &quot;I promise Sakura.&quot; She leaned forward and
kissed Sakura gain. &quot;I love you.&quot;

Sakura kissed her back. &quot;I love you too Madison.&quot;

Suddenly Kero flew into the room and saw them in each other&#39;s arms.
&quot;It&#39;s about time!&quot;

Both girls looked at him angrily then at each other. &quot;Are you thinking
the same thing I am?&quot; Sakura asked.

Madison looked at the table and the cards. &quot;I think that&#39;s a safe bet.&quot;
She and Sakura each reached for a bottle of syrup from the table then
turned to Kero.

Kero looked at them nervously. &quot;Now come on you guys... can&#39;t you take
a little good natured teasing?&quot; He flew back into the wall nervously.
Sakura and Madison grinned and shortly there after the guardian beast
was covered in maple syrup.

------------------------------

Author&#39;s note
Hope you like it. Near the end I kind of had trouble thinking of things
for them to say. The way I saw it though is if two people, let alone
two people who are in love, would probably think along the same lines.
I thought it would be a nice touch if not only did Sakura attach
special meaning to that childhood conversation, but had the same idea
as Madison on how to show her feelings.
