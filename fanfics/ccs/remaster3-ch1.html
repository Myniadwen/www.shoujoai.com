<h1>Remastered III (part 1 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Previously---

The vision. A figure in shadows, wearing a cape and sitting on the 
roof of the Daidouji estates. He was watching her. Sakura looks up, 
noticing for the first time Lunaris in the sky above. &#147;But it&#146;s 
night---&#148;

&#147;Lunaris sometimes appears in people&#146;s visions regardless of time.&#148;

Sakura looks around, but no one. The voice was coming from everywhere 
and yet nowhere.

&#147;Sakura--- it&#146;s not time yet---&#148; (the voice calls to her) &#147;---we&#146;ll 
talk again soon. Sakura--- Sakura--- Sak---&#148; (silence) &#147;Sakura?&#148;

&#147;Who are---&#148; Sakura&#146;s eyes lazily drift open, coming face to face with 
a wide eyed and curious Rena staring at her from in front of her desk. 
&#147;ACK!&#148;

&#147;I know the colonization period of the 21st Century is a tad dry and 
boring but still---&#148; (Rena smiles as she rests her head on Sakura&#146;s 
desk, looking at her sideways. &#147;Have a nice nap?&#148;

&#147;I-I&#146;M SORRY!!!&#148;

&#147;ACK!&#148; (Keiko jumps back with a start, waking out of her own stupor to 
come crashing to the floor in an awkward way) &#147;---ouch---&#148;

&#147;Well I&#146;m glad someone over there had worst falls than that in her 
life--- still---&#148; (a smile creeps across Rena&#146;s face) &#147;---that was 
worth it. Thanks, Sakura.&#148; (stops) &#147;You have practice today?&#148;

&#147;No---&#148;

&#147;Then cuddle and snooze at home please, thanks.&#148; (walks back to the 
board) &#147;And that goes double for you, Miss blades!&#148;

&#147;---oh shove it---&#148; Keiko hisses as she pulls herself back into her 
chair.

The day was nearly done, and they were going to the party for the cast 
members of the play next.

Misho was holding it at a room in the huge Convention Center she built 
in downtown Tokyo, and went through a lot of trouble to make it a hot 
ticket event. Still--- Suddenly Sakura noticed Rena was next to her 
again, &#147;I&#146;m awake!&#148;

Rena leans over and whispers to her, &#147;I noticed how beautiful you are 
when your sleeping. So very very cute--- Nina doesn&#145;t know anything. 
Snoozer indeed. Your so very---&#148; (Rena reaches a hand out, but stops) 
&#147;---I&#146;m jealous.&#148; (with that Rena retreats without another word said, 
leaving Sakura confused.)

-----

&#147;I&#146;m so embarrassed!!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry,&#148; Tomoyo said in a comforting manner, &#147;I tried to wake you 
up.&#148;

&#147;But I had that dream again, and then Rena said---&#148; (stops, blushing) 
&#147;--she said she I was beautiful and she was jealous of me---?&#148;

&#147;Rena said that to you?&#148; Tomoyo asked, her face filled with curiosity. 
&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know---&#148; (class had dismissed and the two were walking to the 
party) &#147;---but I have this strange feeling---&#148;

&#147;Uh oh.&#148; Tomoyo stops, looking a little concerned, &#147;When you feel like 
that something is going to happen. Is there a card nearby?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know--- I can&#146;t explain it but--- something is coming. I 
don&#145;t know what it is but---&#148;

&#147;Give it time then.&#148; (Tomoyo takes Sakura&#146;s hand as she steps past 
her) &#147;It&#146;ll come to you.&#148;

Suddenly Sakura stops, her head looking upwards, &#147;Rena?!&#148;

Sitting perched in a tree, Rena watches as the two draws near, 
dropping down in front of them as they draw close. She reaches into a 
pocket and withdraws two things, a Seeker, and a wristband with a 
jewel setting. &#147;Got something for you, Tomoyo. Merry Christmas.&#148;

&#147;Thanks.&#148; Tomoyo accepts gracefully, her expression turning curious as 
Rena pushes the Seeker sphere towards her. &#147;Your Seeker?&#148;

&#147;Yours. It took me awhile but I found another Seeker, it&#146;s yours. 
Figure it&#146;ll come in handy.&#148;

&#147;---why thank you---&#148; Tomoyo whispers, bowing as she accepts the 
mystical object. &#147;How do I take it home? In my bag?&#148;

&#147;Tap it to the crystal on the wristband. It&#146;s a storage device, it&#146;ll 
hold anything you want in it.&#148;

&#147;How practical!&#148; Tomoyo gleefully remarks, tapping the sphere onto the 
wristband where it&#146;s enveloped in a field of light and swallowed into 
the jewel setting. &#147;How do I---&#148;

&#147;Tap the jewel and think of what you want, and it&#146;ll come out. Easy as 
th---?&#148; (Sakura&#146;s hand grasps Rena&#146;s arm) &#147;---?--- oh but don&#145;t put 
loose candies in there because I did that once and I&#145;m still randomly 
pulling gummy bears out of my storage crystal clinging onto other 
stuff (they&#146;re still edible too) and--- what are you doing?!&#148;

&#147;Rena--- about earlier. What did you mean?&#148;

&#147;About what?&#148; Rena asked with genuine interest, and a tad bit of 
confusion.

&#147;When you said you thought I was beautiful, and was jealous.&#148;

&#147;But I didn&#146;t say---&#148; (stops, face flushes slightly) &#147;---I was down 
with Misho preparing for the party so I asked Catherine to sit in my 
class for me---&#148; (a slight irked expression passes over Rena&#146;s face) 
&#147;Did she take my form? That---&#148; (?) &#147;---what was she---&#148;

&#147;Phwee?&#148;

&#147;Uh--- nothing. Never mind.&#148; (Rena backs away, waving at the two) 
&#147;Better hurry before the party starts without us! Come on!&#148;

&#147;But Ren---&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s gone.&#148; Tomoyo notices, watching her speed off. &#147;What was that 
all about?&#148;

&#147;---I don&#146;t know---&#148;

-----

As the two walk away hand-in-hand, on top of one of the school 
buildings Catherine watches, her hands clenched together as if she was 
wringing them, watching as Sakura &amp; Tomoyo walked away.

&#147;---goddess I am jealous--- aw man---&#148;

Behind her, unknown to her, someone else watches.

&#147;What are you up to, Catherine?&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------


&#147;If I knew this was going to be a cake party I&#146;d have not skipped 
lunch.&#148; Keiko grumbles slightly, poking the table as she sat there 
staring at the others. &#147;We are going to get some cakes over here 
eventually, right? This is a cake party after all--- cake-u, cake-u, 
cake-u!&#148;

&#147;Make up your mind whether you want cake or not you hypocrite!&#148; Misho 
hisses under her breath, leaning back in her spot on the huge table. 
On this table there was Sakura, Tomoyo, Nina &amp; Eliza, Keiko, Rena &amp; 
Misho. (Both Eve &amp; Trinity were on another table with Naoko, Chiharu &amp; 
Rika).

&#147;All I&#146;m saying is that if we&#146;re going to have a cake party--- be nice 
if there was cake, that&#146;s all.&#148;

&#147;Patience oh psychotic one. Patience.&#148; Rena groaned, scanning the huge 
room for a traveling cake cart, &#147;It&#146;ll be here before you can say 
&#147;hypoglycemic coma&#148;.&#148;

Everyone - &#147;Hypoglycemic coma.&#148;

&#147;---not funny---&#148;

-----

Meanwhile--- The Shining Star International Spaceport

(The Dream Continent of Hong Kong)

&#147;I wish it would snow.&#148; Xai Shar muttered beneath her breath. It was 
cold, but not enough to keep the flights grounded--- she hated that.

Outside the viewing windows she could see several of the the huge 
aircraft lumbering into the sky, and coming down for landing right 
next to the stellar capable crafts as they did their take offs and 
landings in turn. She didn&#146;t feel at all comfortable with this, but 
she knew there was no point in arguing with her once she made up her 
mind. She was going, and that was that.

So, with that thought out, she turned to face her companion. &#147;I&#146;d have 
to say I&#146;m a little surprised your going so soon after your 
promotion.&#148; Xai Shar (the 5th Judgment of the Shining Star) remarked, 
her long hair cascading down her back as she shook her head back and 
forth, her Palominian features (animorphic horse/human female 
features) sweating slightly as she regarded her companion. &#147;You&#146;re the 
youngest girl I&#146;ve seen rise to the rank of 11th Judgment. It takes 
some ages to rise the ranks but you&#146;ve done it remarkably fast for one 
so young.&#148;

Silence, her companion seemed too intent on her ticket to notice. She 
only noded her head at Xai Shar&#146;s remarks. &#147;And what of your mentor? 
The one you told me about? Will she be there?&#148;

&#147;Yes. She&#145;s always been there--- in Nippon.&#148;

&#147;And this boy--- I mean man you told me about? Isn&#146;t he leaving also 
for---&#148;

&#147;He is.&#148; She quickly responded, cutting the conversation on him short. 
Xai nods her head, pushing the topic of &#147;him&#148; aside. &#147;Will you be gone 
long?&#148;

&#147;Not long. Not until I help Sempai recapture those annoying cards and 
returned home again.&#148;

&#147;Well, whatever possessed you to do this I wish you the best--- so 
long, Meilin.&#148;

Meilin smiles, her Judgment uniform feeling very comfortable as she 
gives her companion a hug goodbye. &#147;Think Sempai will be surprised I&#146;m 
visiting?&#148;

&#147;Before or after you tell her the good news?&#148;

&#147;She might be a little disagreeable---&#148; (smirks) &#147;---but this time I&#146;m 
not taking no for an answer! Before next year is out I&#145;m going to be a 
married woman and she---&#148; (smiles) &#147;---you know the rest.&#148;

Ten minutes later her flight leaves, destination - Tokyo.

------

Back in Nippon (Tokyo)---

&#147;Cake before I fall asleep or start craving real food already!&#148; Keiko 
sighed in boredom.

&#147;Shut up, you&#146;re only making it worst.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s your party, Misho--- make it come faster!&#148; Nina was grumbling 
now.

&#147;Shut up, you&#146;re only making it worst.&#148;

&#147;Sorry to keep you waiting.&#148;

&#147;Shut up, you&#146;re only making it--- oh. Never mind---&#148; (Misho looks 
over, and nearly falls over) &#147;WHAT?!? YOU???&#148;

&#147;Toya?!&#148;

&#147;H-H-&#148; (Misho was speechless, for once)

&#147;What are you doing here---?&#148;

&#147;Working.&#148;

&#147;A-A--- HOW?!?&#148;

&#147;How many times do you fire him only to rehire him again?&#148; Keiko 
remarks sharply.

&#147;I&#146;m not doing this!! What&#146;s going on?!?&#148; (takes the cake from Toya 
anyway despite her anger)

&#147;Sheesh. The guy really does work everywhere---&#148; Nina sarcastically 
remarks as she pokes her cake abit before eating it, &#147;Doesn&#146;t Yuki 
pull his weight in their relationship or is Toya doing all the work?&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s eat.&#148; Tomoyo quickly shifts the subject, noting Toya&#146;s peeved 
expression at Nina, &#147;It looks delicious!&#148;

&#147;It is.&#148; Misho (coming back to Terrra) remarks, sticking another bite 
into her mouth.

&#147;It&#146;s absolutely divine!&#148; Sakura pines, her face glowing radiantly as 
she and Tomoyo smile at each other, taking a bit of their cakes and 
feeding the other watching their faces as they chewed and relished the 
tastes of the other&#145;s food. Keiko takes another bite and swallows 
hard, &#147;Try not to jump each other while at the table please.&#148; 
Inspired, Nina suddenly jumps up from her spot and dashes over to 
Eliza&#146;s table, jumping into place to swap cakes with her and do the 
romantic thing Sakura/Tomoyo were doing.

Toya looked peeved x2, Rena couldn&#146;t care less, and Misho just wanted 
another cake (grabbing one from the huge tray Toya bought) when 
suddenly, &#147;That really does look good.&#148;

At the sound of the voice, both Rena &amp; Keiko sigh irritably. &#147;The 
walking 8-ball.&#148;

&#147;Ms. Mitsuki!&#148; Sakura suddenly freaks a little, noticing she was 
watching the two from behind them for a little while now. Seconds 
later another person came into view, Catherine, she borrows Sakura for 
a second and puts Ms. Mitsuki down on their table while she talks with 
her. Keiko grabs her seconds later and walks off with her to stop her 
from staring at Tomoyo.

Obviously Rena and Keiko aren&#146;t tickled pink by this, but Tomoyo 
watches with some interest as the two talk quietly over at another 
table. &#147;You know why Keiko &amp; Rena are here, and you know in a sense 
why I&#146;m here--- have you ever wondered why Nina&#146;s here though?&#148;

&#147;Orders?&#148;

&#147;Eventually however, with all this support your getting from the 
Judgments and a Raven you&#146;d think Command would give Nina the option 
to opt out of her mission and go back on leave again. She was on 
offtime when she was called in for the job after all, you&#146;d think 
she&#146;d want to return to that.&#148;

Sakura - &#147;Maybe they didn&#146;t call her back?&#148;

Catherine - &#147;Maybe they did and she wanted to stay here.&#148;

Sakura - &#147;Did Nina tell you that?&#148;

Catherine - &#147;No. Nina doesn&#146;t like talking to me. She keeps her 
distance from me.&#148; (suddenly Catherine grows a little distant, her 
thoughts wandering) &#147;Only five people to date have made cards linked 
to magical forces. One connected to mystical items called &#147;Millennium 
Items&#148;, Clow Reed of course and his Clow Cards, the person who forged 
the first mystical set of Tarot cards, a distant relative of Misho 
NamoCatCat whose ancestor created crystal cards capable of entrapping 
necromancy beings (Rubicon cards), and---&#148; (Catheirne stops) &#147;---well, 
the art is a very rare one in consideration of all the mystical 
artifacts forged over the ages.&#148;

Sakura - &#147;Are you---&#148; (at this Catherine returns to reality)

Catherine - &#147;I was involved somewhat with Misho&#146;s family legacy, the 
Rubicon cards. She still carries some to this very day as a matter of 
fact. Nina plays the game that is related to the Millennium Items, 
while you collect Clow Cards. So in a sense I&#146;m partially linked to 
the chain of magic that is related to cards. And so is Misho, Nina, 
Keiko, Rena--- all of us here who have joined you have some connection 
to card magic in one form or another it seems. And there&#146;s even a few 
you haven&#146;t met yet---&#148;

&#147;Who?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll know when the time is right---&#148; (Catherine goes distant again) 
&#147;What do you know about Ravens, Sakura? The guardian class known as 
Ravens, I mean (not the bird).&#148;

&#147;Not much. Only what Nina, or Keiko, or someone told me. They&#146;re 
powerful, right? Like you?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m only Neo level power. That&#146;s strong, but there&#146;s a few levels 
above mine to go. One other, who is with you but not obvious, is a 
Theta. There&#146;s even stronger levels than that as well---&#148; (Catherine 
smiles, reaching out to pass a hand through Sakura&#146;s hair) &#147;---I&#146;m 
sorry I confused you while I was in Rena&#146;s form. I didn&#146;t mean to, 
but--- you truly are very beautiful.&#148;

-----

&#147;What the hell are they talking about?&#148; Rena grumbles beneath her 
breath, the Seeker flashing bright but showing nothing to her. Ms. 
Mitsuki was with Keiko and Eve at another table, and Misho went to 
another table leaving them alone to talk. &#147;Even this can&#146;t tap into 
their conversation.&#148; (with a grunt she puts the Seeker back into 
place) &#147;Catherine&#146;s being super paranoid today.&#148;

&#147;Can it listen in to conversations?&#148; (Tomoyo)

&#147;Less of listening in, more like it taps the surface &#147;thoughts&#148; of the 
two talking. When people talk they tend to think out their words as 
well as speak them, the Seeker just grazes those top thoughts and 
relays them. It&#146;s a very light and non-evasive technique so it 
normally would be beneath Catherine to protect against such a weak and 
low level reading--- but today she is for some reason.&#148;

&#147;Maybe she just wants her privacy.&#148;

&#147;And if she wanted that she could go to the girl&#146;s bathroom to talk to 
Sakura--- and then we&#146;d be at the door listening with water glasses.&#148; 
(sighs irritably) &#147;I guess what I&#146;m really getting at is she&#146;s taking 
far too many precautions for a simple little chat--- eh? Oh, great, 
it&#146;s the walking 8-ball---&#148; Rena sighs under her breath, &#147;And they&#146;re 
breaking up the talk. Well, so much for that.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong? You seem rather down.&#148; (Tomoyo)

&#147;---?--- oh, yeah. Sakura&#146;s getting all dosey-dorky with Ms. Mitsuki 
again. It&#146;s a wonder nobody wrote a lemon with them doing---&#148; (sighs 
irritably) &#147;Sorry, it&#146;s just that Kaho gets on my nerves. I keep 
telling Sakura to not get suckered in like that but she never 
listens!&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s Sakura for you.&#148;

&#147;----and if I knew her like you did, Tomoyo, I&#146;d actually know what 
that meant.&#148;

&#147;Why are you giving Sakura advice?&#148;

For a few seconds silence reigns, but Rena eventually finds her voice. 
&#147;Eh? Oh--- I&#146;m one of the few with actual advice to give. Heaven 
forbid the person staying at your place can contribute something, but 
Nina&#146;s about as useful in the advice dept. as a &#147;Tickle-Me-Elmo&#148;. 
That&#146;s why.&#148;

&#147;I thought you&#146;d want the girl who snubbed you from being the hero to 
collect the Clow cards to fail at her task?&#148;

Rena sighs, leaning back in her spot. &#147;Don&#146;t read too much into it--- 
I&#145;m not that jealous of Sakura. Maybe--- I don&#145;t think so---&#148; (staring 
up at the ceiling, Rena begins to loll her head back and forth) &#147;---I 
just don&#146;t like half-ass jobs. If it&#146;s going to be done, even if I&#146;m 
not the one doing it, it&#146;s gotta be done right. Sure I could have done 
it better, but that&#145;s old news--- best not to go over it over and over 
again.&#148;

&#147;So why do you worry about Sakura?&#148; Tomoyo baits, to which Rena looks 
down at her irritated. &#147;Go fish somewhere else. I have somebody 
already. It&#146;s not like the first time around and it&#146;ll never be that 
again after I had a say about---&#148; (hisses) &#147;---and you didn&#146;t hear 
that from me.&#148;

&#147;Hear what?&#148;

&#147;----I honestly hate you at times----&#148;

-----

&#147;Pick something.&#148; (Misho)

&#147;Make up your mind.&#148; (Toya)

&#147;But they all look so good---&#148; (Sakura)

&#147;Recommend something.&#148; (Misho)

&#147;Why?&#148; (Toya)

&#147;Am I paying you to work for me or to sass me! Help her---&#148; (Misho)

&#147;She can pick something.&#148; (Toya)

&#147;I don&#146;t have eternity plus one to wait for THAT!!&#148; (Misho)

&#147;Then you pick something.&#148; (Toya)

&#147;---but they all look so good---&#148; (Misho, mouth drooling a little)

Toya sighs irritably.

Keiko walks up, makes a few selections, and sighs. &#147;The walking eight 
ball is coming over.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; (Misho/Sakura look back) &#147;She&#146;s with Catherine?&#148;

&#147;The two make a cute couple--- if Kaho didn&#146;t have a sick twisted idea 
of her ideal mate.&#148;

&#147;Still going on about that?&#148; Rena grumbles, joining the four, &#147;It&#146;s 
bad enough to listen to you gripe about it at mission briefings, must 
you bitch about it in public?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m just saying it&#146;s dead wrong and---&#148; (?) &#147;---Sakura&#146;s lost it.&#148;

&#147;?&#148; (looks down at Sakura&#146;s clueless expression) &#147;Whoops. Too much 
information.&#148;

&#147;No kidding.&#148; Keiko sighs as she tries to bring Sakura back to 
reality.

Seconds later--- &#147;There. Now that wasn&#146;t so hard--- only took several 
tries---&#148; Misho sighs irritably. &#147;Let&#146;s go---&#148;

&#147;Your Sakura, right?&#148; (she turns to the voice next to her) &#147;Tomoyo 
asked me to look for you. Come on, she&#146;s waiting.&#148; (Sakura reaches 
out, grabbing the male&#146;s hand and feeling a strange warmth from it) 
&#145;!&#146; (Sakura blushes abit) &#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;N-n-nothing---&#148;

Seconds later, she confides her feelings to Tomoyo.

&#147;The same?&#148;

&#147;It was the same feeling I had when I touched Catherine&#146;s hand. That 
strange warmth--- who is--?&#148;

&#147;We met him during the Fly incident, remember?&#148;

&#147;Oh, right. Captain Lazarus--- what&#146;s he---?&#148;

&#147;He helped with the stage settings for the play and did the background 
imagery.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; (smiles) &#147;I thought those were really cute!&#148;

-----

&#147;Getting a little too close are we, Jack?&#148; Keiko remarks as she slides 
up next to him.

&#147;Just doing a favor for Tomoyo.&#148; he remarks as he bites into a piece 
of cake. &#147;Not bad.&#148;

&#147;I think she copped a feel off of your power aura.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s suppressed. She can&#146;t do that.&#148;

&#147;Oh, really. So why did she suddenly blank out for a second? I think 
she felt your aura and she was covering it up. She felt something 
touching you and it wasn&#146;t a lolita crush on you either.&#148;

&#147;Heaven forbid we go through the whole Yuki thing again---&#148;

&#147;The point is---&#148; Keiko leans forward abit to accentuate the point, 
&#147;Just how much do we REALLY know about how sensitive her powers are? 
She might be able to detect a power level even if it&#146;s being buried by 
technique. She seems very sensitive to mystical energy, even if the 
user is trying to bury that energy in her presence--- though only by 
touch it seems. She can&#146;t read it by her sensory &#147;touch&#148;.&#148;

&#147;For which we&#146;re all grateful or she&#146;d be reading more than she needs 
to know now.&#148;

Keiko moves away, but stops--- &#147;What if she needs to know more than 
we&#146;re giving her?&#148;

She moves away before he can question her further. &#147;---sigh---&#148;

&#147;So--- what were you two talking about?&#148; (Catherine)

Jack turns his head and stares at her as she sits down. &#147;What were you 
talking about with Sakura?&#148;

&#147;Not THAT if that&#146;s what your wondering--- I can keep that under tight 
wraps.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re not having---&#148;

Catherine stops, and smiles at Jack. &#147;Don&#146;t do that, Cathy, that&#146;s the 
same look Mitsuki gives to weasel her way out of talking--- and I find 
it even more disturbing to see YOU do it!&#148;

&#147;Sorry. It&#146;s going to be awhile longer--- but she&#146;s getting there.&#148;

&#147;And where are you getting to?&#148;

&#147;---I don&#146;t know--- maybe I will soon.&#148;

Jack leans back, his thoughts racing---

&#145;She&#146;s right. It&#146;s only a matter of time before all the cards are 
retrieved once again. But then---&#146; (sighs as he takes another bite) 
&#145;---that&#146;s when things are going to get touchy.&#146;

&#145;As Sakura seals each card she&#146;s bringing about the triggering of 
Final Judgment--- but if she isn&#146;t the one to be judged, having 
already been judged--- who will she judge in turn? I feel as if she&#146;ll 
stand over someone in judgment--- but who? Nina? Keiko? Rena? 
Catherine? Maybe even myself?&#146; Jack&#146;s eyes rove the scene before him 
as he bites into the cake again, finishing it off as he reaches for a 
new one. &#145;Nervous as all heck, must explain my chewy-chewy mood today. 
Just can&#146;t stop chewing---&#146; (sighs as hew chews again) &#145;It didn&#146;t go 
the way we thought it would when we visited her world--- everything 
went so horribly wrong. Even this fix might not last if the 
ramifications of what we did then come back to haunt us.&#146;

&#145;For one of us, our own time of judgment is coming--- then what?&#146;

-----

&#147;For the last time stop staring at me!&#148; Rena grumbles, putting a few 
people between herself and Tomoyo, &#147;Your reading too much into it! 
Stop it!&#148;

&#147;Stop what?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll tell you later.&#148;

&#147;OH NO YOU DON&#146;T!!&#148;

Tomoyo laughs as she and Sakura walks off in one direction, leaving 
the others to stare at Rena. &#147;What?!? Nothing happened!! Stop glaring 
at me!! (Go on Nina! They&#146;re walking home so get going! Stop staring 
at me!!&#148;) (Rena storms off in a huff with Trinity close behind, in a 
giggly mood.)

As Nina and Eliza catches up to the two, the obvious question comes 
out. &#147;What were you and Rena talking about anyway? She&#146;s in a huff 
about it!&#148;

&#147;Nothing much.&#148; Tomoyo answers, and then she goes back to talking to 
Sakura.

&#147;Something much or she wouldn&#146;t be in a bad mood---&#148; Nina sighs. 
&#147;Then, Sakura, what did you talk about with Cathy?&#148;

Sakura&#146;s answer is about as vague as Tomoyo&#146;s prodding of Rena.

&#147;---sorry I asked---&#148;

----

Monday (December 16th)

Four more days before the Christmas break begins.

&#147;STOP SAYING IT!!&#148;

Nina looks about in a huff, her fist clenched and her teeth grinding 
together.

&#147;Say what?&#148; Sakura, in her school uniform (this happened on the way to 
school) asked, her face filled with genuine curiosity. Tomoyo was off 
to one side, silent, simply content to let Nina fume as she recorded 
the entire thing for posterity&#146;s sake.

&#147;You know what I mean! The minute it latched onto my card case you 
said it! It&#146;s been moving everytime you say it! Everytime the word 
comes out of your mouth it moves! Doesn&#146;t that give you the slightest 
hint---&#148; (Nina stops, a shiver coming down her spine as if something 
was close---) &#147;---don&#146;t---&#148;

&#147;The Move ca---&#148; (it vanishes again)

&#147;I SAID NOT TO SAY IT!!!&#148; (Nina stomps down hard and storms off in a 
huff) &#147;I GIVE UP! YOU CAPTURE THE DAMN THING AND GET ME MY CARDS 
BACK!!&#148;

&#147;But it&#146;s almost time for school!&#148;

&#147;And whose fault is it someone keeps yelling &#147;Move&#148;! &#147;Move!&#148; &#147;Mo---&#148;&#148; 
(pok) (Nina, in her haste, runs right into Move, stunning herself 
temporarily as she walks face first into her own card case and 
knocking Move off it&#146;s stride, sending it warbling through the air as 
Nina tries to recover. Sakura, with Tomoyo close behind, is on it 
before it can recover though. &#147;Clow Card, return to your power 
confined, MOVE CARD!!&#148; (it&#146;s quickly captured, Nina&#146;s card case 
falling into Eliza&#146;s open hand as the card is sealed) &#147;Here--- uh--- 
Nina? That looks painful---&#148; (pries Nina&#146;s hands from her face) 
&#147;---eeww---&#148;

&#147;Well we have to go! Bye, Nina!&#148;

&#147;---wait!! I---&#148; (Nina huffs and pouts) &#147;---I hate them.&#148;

------

&#147;Stop wiggling. Stop it, I can&#146;t fix it if you don&#146;t stop wiggling---&#148;

&#147;It hurts, alright? I--- ouch!! Eliza!!&#148;

&#147;Sorry!&#148; she apologies, trying to get Nina&#146;s head to stop bobbing 
about as she tries to fix the damage. The card case hit her at an odd 
angle and gave her a gash on her face, a small cut but it hurt all the 
same to Nina. &#147;There, it&#146;ll take a few seconds and it&#146;ll be good as 
new--- Nina!&#148;

&#147;I can&#146;t help it! Ouch!&#148;

The two were sitting in the dining area of the underground monitoring 
base beneath Sakura&#146;s school, and Nina wasn&#146;t in a good mood right 
now. &#147;I can&#146;t believe she ditched on us!&#148;

&#147;You were planning on ditching on her, remember? And she was late for 
school.&#148;

&#147;Late, schmate! She made it on time and class is only now just 
starting!&#148; (Nina wiggles her head abit as Eliza finishes the job) 
&#147;Still stings a little.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;ll take awhile for it to go away.&#148; (kisses the injury) &#147;Want me to 
kiss it some more and make it all better? Maybe---&#148; (fingers tracing 
across Nina&#146;s chest) &#147;---we&#146;ll play &#147;doctor&#148;---&#148;

&#147;Hmmm--- well, when you put it like that, I---&#148;

&#147;Nina?&#148; (the commsystem)

&#147;Argh--- what is it?&#148;

&#147;You better get in here. Something&#146;s up in Sakura&#146;s class.&#148;

The two exchange glances before heading out the door.

------

&#147;Maybe we should plan our Christmas shopping during Keiko&#146;s lame 
period.&#148; Rena sighs.

&#147;It&#146;s NOT a lame period! I just don&#146;t have anything to teach---&#148;

&#147;Hence why it&#146;s the lame period---&#148; (?) &#147;---what&#146;s Mr. Terada 
writing?&#148;

&#147;Class? May I have your attention---?&#148; (waits for a few seconds before 
speaking again) &#147;I have an announcement to make. A student some of you 
might remember from a few years ago is transferring back to our class 
and I want you all to make her feel welcome.&#148;

&#147;Student?&#148; Sakura whispers, confused. &#147;Who could be transferring here 
at this time of year?&#148;

&#147;Kind of late for a transfer student---&#148; Tomoyo whispers back.

&#147;Come on in, Meilin---&#148;

Keiko nearly falls out of her seat.

Meilin passes everyone and walks right to the back.

&#147;Meilin!&#148; (Sakura jumps out of her seat) &#147;It&#146;s good to see you again! 
I---&#148; (Meilin walks right past her and to Keiko) &#147;Sempai! I missed 
you!!&#148; (grabs Keiko and hugs her to her disbelief) &#147;---?---&#148;

&#147;Sempai? Your blushing! Are you embarrassed? Is she bothering you?&#148; 
(glaring at Rena)

Rena looks over at the two in surprise, &#147;Never thought she was the 
type---&#148;

-----

Keiko&#146;s free period

Keiko, obviously, wasn&#146;t in a good mood.

&#147;What are you DOING?!?&#148;

&#147;I came here to help you catch the Clow cards!&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t remember ASKING for assistance!&#148; (Keiko sighs heavily as she 
shifts about in her chair) &#147;And besides which you can&#146;t---&#148;

&#147;Can&#146;t what?&#148;

&#147;Help me catch something even I can&#146;t catch!&#148; Keiko hisses beneath her 
breath, her face scrunching up as she talks, &#147;Don&#146;t make me be so damn 
obvious to you!&#148;

&#147;You need the help, and I felt a visit wasn&#146;t out of the question 
especially---&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t you have duties back in the Shining Star?&#148; Keiko irritably told 
Meilin, &#147;Why aren&#146;t you tending to your duties? Get off my back and go 
home!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s time. Remember? You promised---&#148;

Keiko&#145;s eyes widen abit, &#147;Oh no! No, no, no! Not getting me hooked 
into that!&#148;

Meanwhile, over at another part of the class---

&#147;What are those two carrying on about? They&#146;ve been up there at the 
front rattling on in whispers for the past two minutes!&#148; Rena remarks, 
watching the two talk. &#147;You&#146;d think she&#146;d actually like one of her 
mistresses showing up.&#148;

&#147;Mistress?&#148; (Sakura)

&#147;She&#146;s making that up.&#148; (Nina, who showed up after Keiko&#146;s class 
started) &#147;Keiko&#146;s not the type to keep a mistress--- Eve would kill 
her if she did.&#148;

&#147;Well they&#146;re going on about something! Tomoyo! Don&#146;t you think---&#147; 
(looks at Tomoyo who only has eyes for Sakura and vice versa) 
&#147;---never mind. Look, Keiko nearly slashed one of the students for 
getting to close to them, remember? She&#146;s awfully wound up about 
something and it isn&#146;t just that her prize &#147;pupil&#148; (heaven forbid she 
actually has a prize anything, let alone a pupil) has shown up at the 
least appropriate moment to hassle her--- oh, wait, here they come.&#148;

Meilin, holding onto Keiko, walks her back ot the others. &#147;It&#146;s 
settled. I&#146;m staying to help, and we&#146;re going to have a party on New 
Years&#146; to celebrate!&#148;

&#147;Celebrate?&#148;

&#147;My spring time wedding of course!&#148;

&#147;----&#148;

&#147;---say what---&#148; (Rena)

&#147;That&#146;s great---&#148; (Sakura) &#147;---who are you marrying?&#148;

&#147;My sempai!&#148;

Everyone looks over at Keiko, who gives them all a dirty look and 
motions to her blade, &#147;HER OTHER SEMPAI!! (get your minds out of the 
gutters!!) Meilin stop being so vague!&#148;

&#147;Aw! Don&#146;t be modest! Polygamy suits yo---&#148; (stops as Keiko draws her 
blade) &#147;---never mind.&#148;

&#147;Who---&#148; (Meilin hands Tomoyo a photo, causing her to smile) &#147;---oh 
she&#146;s very beautiful! You must be a lucky girl to have won your 
heart.&#148;

&#147;I&#145;m even luckier to have won her heart!&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s cute! You&#145;ll be happy together!&#148; (Sakura)

&#147;I think she&#146;s great! Good for you!&#148; (Nina)

&#147;She&#146;s marrying a horse-girl?&#148; (Rena)

&#147;THAT&#146;S IT!!!&#148; (Meilin jumps on top of Rena beating her down with her 
fists)

&#147;WAIT! I---ouch! Ow! Ow! Stop it! Ow! Ow! Ow!! Cut it---ou! Ow! Ow!&#148;

Keiko nods her head. &#147;Anti climatic. She&#146;s marrying her mentor who 
she&#146;s been under for a few years now back at the Shining Star.&#148;

Rena looks up, her mouth as of yet unwilling to stay shut. &#147;Oh, that 
figures she&#146;s been under her for years. Does pony-girl yell &#147;giddyap&#148; 
and whip Meilin during sex--- Ow!! Ow!! Stop--- ow!!&#148;

&#147;----idiot, keep your mouth shut and you won&#145;t get hurt---&#148; (Keiko)

&#147;Is this legal? (the marriage, not Meilin kicking the heck out of 
Rena)&#148; (Nina)

&#147;I guess. Palominians don&#146;t have strange marriage rules like---&#148; 
(stops, sighs) &#147;---well, they&#146;re open about marriage. So I guess a 
human/Palominian marriage isn&#146;t out of the question.&#148;

Nina suddenly becomes rather morose and trudges off, leaving Sakura 
confused. &#147;What&#146;s wrong? Isn&#146;t she happy for---?&#148;

&#147;Damn I knew I shouldn&#146;t have brought it up. It&#146;s that time of year 
after all.&#148; (Keiko)

Sakura can only shake her head in confusion, &#147;What time of year?&#148; 
(Tomoyo asks, drawing closer to Sakura to draw her close)

&#147;Oh, yeah, that&#146;s right. You don&#146;t know---&#147; Keiko leans back in her 
chair, putting her thoughts together. &#147;Nina&#146;s been trying to get up 
the courage to propose to Eliza for a few years now, but Amazonians as 
a cultural usually think it&#146;s a dirty thing for Amazonians to marry 
outside of their species and--- well--- Nina&#146;s afraid. You see? 
Usually Amazonians only take non-Amazonians as--- well, as--- 
playmates, and they usually marry within their species. Only a few 
Amazonians ever married outside their species but they usually are--- 
well--- ostracized from their families after that.&#148;

&#147;So---&#148;

&#147;Eliza&#146;s family already doesn&#146;t like Nina. She&#146;s afraid Eliza will 
reject her if she tries to propose marriage. That she&#145;s just a--- you 
know--- and Eliza might not be as serious about this relationship---&#148;

&#147;---that&#146;s sad----&#148; Sakura whispers, looking sad for Nina.

&#147;Can&#146;t we do something to help her?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s best in situations like this to not interfere, Tomoyo.&#148; (smiles 
as she pokes Tomoyo&#146;s cheek, watching the two (Tomoyo/Sakura) cuddle a 
little closer as she speaks) &#147;I know you two want to do something nice 
for her, but it&#146;s best to let her resolve this on her own. She usually 
tries near Christmas so it&#146;ll come to a resolution within a few 
days----&#148; (stops) &#147;----and you can get off of Rena now.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s rude!&#148; Meilin spits out, sitting back in her chair in a huff as 
Keiko pulls Rena back into her chair, &#147;You dead yet, &#147;Rude-na?&#148;

&#147;Shut up!&#148; (Rena sits up wearily, collapsing into her desk) &#147;I&#146;m not 
in the mood.&#148;

&#147;If your not in the mood, you shouldn&#146;t have opened your yap like 
that.&#148;

&#147;Screw you, miss perfection!&#148;

Silence reigns for a few seconds, then---

&#147;What if we used the Fight card to force the issue?&#148;

Eyes turns to Rena, looking at her. &#147;If Nina takes a beating for 
Eliza, Nina might be able to slip in her marriage proposal while in 
Eliza&#146;s arms and she&#146;d be too distraught to say no.&#148;

&#147;Isn&#146;t that interfering?&#148; Tomoyo asks, &#147;Didn&#146;t you want to help her, 
or not?&#148;

The trio exchange glances, then look back at Rena. &#147;Nice in theory,&#148; 
(Keiko) &#147;though a tad clich&eacute; and fatalistically Florence 
Nightengale-esque for Eliza to be helpless against a battered Nina&#146;s 
wish to marry, but there&#146;s one problem. The Fight card is still on the 
loose. And it&#146;s not going to simply appear just because the plot 
demands it---&#148; (Tomoyo catches newspaper thrown by Rena) &#147;---what 
the--- girl in strange outfit beats up Darklings?&#148; (reads on) &#147;Girl in 
strange outfit appearing within the Mega Neko Industrial Park stopped 
two Darklings from assaulting a young secretary on her way home from 
work.&#148;

&#147;Isn&#146;t that industrial park---?&#148;

&#147;It used to be where King Penguin Park was? Yes.&#148;

&#147;Looks like she&#146;s going back to her old haunts.&#148; Rena smiles, pleased 
with herself.

&#147;No problem. She&#146;s still wearing the same outfit as before---&#148; (Keiko 
stops as she&#146;s handed the paper while Tomoyo/Sakura look on) 
&#147;---that&#146;s very appropriate.&#148;

&#147;What is she---?&#148;

It was Fight all right, dressed up like---- a female St. Nick? (minus 
the beard and tighter clothes)

&#147;Yeah. I thought it was a gag too but I matched it up and it fits.&#148; 
(smiles at Meilin) &#147;Looks like it&#146;s memory lane for you. Didn&#146;t she 
beat you on your first date? Bet she gave you weird tastes in sex 
af---!!&#148; (dodges attack) &#147;Cut it out! I&#146;m just kidd--- stop it!! Hey!! 
Stop!! Keiko!!&#148;

Keiko leans back into her chair and sighs, &#147;I&#146;m not involved. You two 
work it out yourselves.&#148;

&#147;KEI--ow!! Get off me!! (again!!)&#148;

Keiko - &#147;Grasshopper has big mouth, little brain.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll grasshop--- ouch!! Stop it!! Stop it!! I didn&#146;t know you were 
into S&amp;M--- ouch!! Stop!!&#148;

&#147;Hi!&#148; (Ms. Mitsuki) &#147;I&#146;ll be subbing for Cath---erine and--- I&#146;ll---?? 
I didn&#146;t see that coming.&#148;

Keiko - &#147;With Rena nobody ever sees the beatings coming. Not even 
Rena.&#148;

&#147;I HEARD TH--- ouch!! Ow!! Stop it!! Ow!!&#148;
