<a href="../ccs/1fateful-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>FEAR OF WHAT OTHERS WILL THINK. 

BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP!! Went Sakura&#39;s clock at 7:00a.m. waking her. 

&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Yawned Sakura as she hit the snooze button and fell back 
on the bed. 

&quot;Sakura? SAKURA!!&quot; Yelled her dad. 

&quot;Huh? What is it?&quot; 

&quot;Hurry up... you&#39;re going to be late for school!&quot; 

&quot;Ok, ok, I&#39;m coming.&quot; 

She throws back the covers and gets up out of bed. She looks into her 
desk drawer to see Kero sleeping peacefully. 

&quot;SAKURA!!&quot; 

&quot;Coming!&quot; She replies as she runs to the closet to get her uniform. 

She quickly slips out of her PJ&#39;s and puts on her uniform, still 
buttoning the shirt on her way down the stairs. Expecting Touya&#39;s usual, 
&quot;Good morning monster&quot;, she&#39;s surprised when she doesn&#39;t see him at the 
table. 

&quot;Where&#39;s Touya?&quot; She asks her dad. 

&quot;He had to go into work early today, so he won&#39;t be joining us for 
breakfast.&quot;  

The whole time she was eating, she couldn&#39;t take her mind off the 
previous day. 

She was so happy that her dad and Tomoyo&#39;s mom were ok with them being 
in love. After putting her dishes in the sink, she gave her dad a hug 
and a kiss and told him that she was heading off to school. 

&quot;Have a nice day Sakura!&quot; Her dad called out from the front door. 

&quot;Thanks dad! See you later!&quot; 

As usual her and Tomoyo met up on their way to school. 

&quot;Tomoyo!!&quot; Yells Sakura. 

&quot;Sakura!!&quot; Tomoyo yells back. 

The two of them give each other a hug and a kiss and start walking hand 
in hand towards their Jr. High School which was only about a 10 minute 
walk from their meeting point. 

When they arrived at school, they were greeted by their friends. 

&quot;Tomoyo!! Sakura!!&quot; They called out. 

&quot;Hey everyone!!&quot; 

&quot;So is it true?&quot; They all asked at the same time.  

&quot;What?&quot; Replied Sakura. 

&quot;That you two are in love and dating now?&quot; 

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Thought Sakura. &quot;How did they find out!? Already!&quot; 

&quot;Where did you hear that!?&quot; Yelled Sakura.  

&quot;From Touya. We saw him on our way to school and he told us all about 
it.&quot; 

&quot;That idiot!! I&#39;m going to kill him!!&quot; 

&quot;So it is true!&quot; 

Sakura and Tomoyo could do nothing more than turn bright red with 
embarrassment at this point. 

&quot;We... We were trying to figure out the best way to tell you guys.&quot; Said 
Sakura meekly. 

&quot;You thought we would think that you two were weird and stop being your 
friends, right?&quot; 

&quot;Uh huh.&quot; 

&quot;We would never do that! Right girls?&quot; 

&quot;RIGHT!!&quot; 

&quot;Thank You... Thank You all very much. You guys are true friends.&quot; 

&quot;Now that you got that off your chests, tell us, have you two...&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;You know...&quot; 

&quot;Uh... Uh huh.&quot; They both nodded. 

&quot;Really? What&#39;s it like... being with each other.&quot; 

&quot;Lovely.&quot; Replied Sakura. 

&quot;After telling each other your true feelings, did you two... have sex?&quot;  

&quot;No.&quot; Said Tomoyo while looking into Sakura&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;We made love.&quot; Said Sakura, trying to hold back her tears of happiness. 

As the day went on, the word spread that Sakura and Tomoyo were now an 
item and people all over school were telling them how happy they were 
that they found true love in each other. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad that&#39;s over with.&quot; Says Sakura. 

&quot;Me too.&quot; Replied Tomoyo. &quot;Now we don&#39;t have to worry about keeping it a 
secret anymore.&quot;  

Sakura and Tomoyo were beaming as they walked home hand in hand. Both of 
them happy that they finally found their true love... in each other. 

                

                                                                                                          
THE END.
