<h1>Tomoyo's Moving On?</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/meikosama.html">Azfixiation</a><br> </h2>
<pre>notes: well this is definitely weird for me to write. I always swore I
would never ever write anything that involved Sakura and Syaoran as a
couple but this was just a crazy idea I got while being bored in
school. As for Meiling&#39;s character, I&#39;d like some feedback about that.
I&#39;ve only seen her in the movie so I don&#39;t know much of her personality
to know if she&#39;s out of character or not. But I did the best I can. As
for ages, let&#39;s just say that they are in high school. ^^

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura asked her friends name to see if she was asleep
or not.. When she felt Tomoyo shifting in the bed she knew her friend
was still awake. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for coming here so suddenly tonight. It&#39;s
just I had no where else to go, and your the only one I can turn to.&quot;

&quot;Daijoubu, Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo said, her voice seeming loud to her as
she held her best friend in her arms. &quot;I&#39;m glad you feel like you can
still come to me like this.&quot;

&quot;I told you Tomoyo, I&#39;ll always love you as my best friend, and I&#39;ll
always need you. I just don&#39;t feel the same as you. Gomen ne.&quot;

&quot;I know, and I couldn&#39;t ever ask for more than your understanding of my
feelings. I&#39;m glad your still my best friend.&quot; Tomoyo said as she
enjoyed the feel of having Sakura in her arms. When she had told Sakura
of her true feelings she expected that they would grow apart. That
Sakura would hate her. Much to her surprise, and Sakura&#39;s, they two grew
even closer. Just not in the way Tomoyo had always dreamed of.

At first it was hard on Tomoyo knowing Sakura would never return her
feelings. But when she thought of nights like the one she was having
now, everything seemed okay. She still had Sakura, and was very
important to Sakura. After a few months the pain went away and she
learned how to enjoy what she and Sakura had.

&quot;So you want to tell me what happened with him?&quot; Tomoyo asked still
unsure of why Sakura showed up at her house crying and how she ended up
in her arms.

&quot;He got mad at me. I don&#39;t why or what happened even. He was just so
cold to me. He..he said he hated me,&quot; Sakura stopped as tears once
again claimed her eyes. Tomoyo held on to her tightly as she ran her
fingers through Sakura&#39;s hair trying to calm her.

&quot;I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t mean it. Syaoran isn&#39;t the type to do that. He&#39;s
probably just stressed about something and I&#39;m sure he regrets the
whole thing now,&quot; Tomoyo assured her friend. She saw Sakura look up at
her in the dim lit room and wiped the tears from her eyes. &quot;It&#39;ll be
okay. I promise you. I know how much he loves you. Almost as much as I
do,&quot; Tomoyo stopped to laugh for a second. Never had she imagined being
able to talk about her feelings so openly to Sakura.

&quot;Arigatou Tomoyo-chan. I don&#39;t see how I could ever live without your
support,&quot; Sakura said as she snuggled closer to Tomoyo. &quot;I know I don&#39;t
make it easier on you, but you really should get over me.&quot; Sakura told
her friend.

&quot;Maybe one day. But as for now I don&#39;t think there could ever be anyone
that can live up to you. I know you and Li-kun will be together forever
so I&#39;ll have to get over you eventually. But I don&#39;t see any need to
force myself to get over you.&quot; Tomoyo was content with being like this.
Sakura was still by her side. She learned to give up the false hope
that one day Sakura would change her mind, but she still enjoyed these
nights. Minus the fact that Sakura was usually hurt whenever she needed
Tomoyo so much.

After a few minutes of silence Tomoyo noticed that Sakura had finally
fallen asleep. &#39;Things could definitely be much worse for me,&#39; Tomoyo
thought before falling to sleep herself.

______________

The next morning Tomoyo woke up when she heard a soft knock on her
door. She realized Sakura was still in her arms, and not wanting to
wake her she silently told the maid to come in her room. &quot;You have a
visitor Tomoyo-san,&quot; she informed her. &quot;It&#39;s that boy Li-kun.&quot;

As Tomoyo knew he would, Syaoran was there to apologize to Sakura and
make up for the other night. He came into the room and Tomoyo still had
Sakura in her arms. She finally got out of bed and left Syaoran with
his girlfriend. &quot;She&#39;s all yours now. Just don&#39;t make her cry anymore,&quot;
Tomoyo told him as she left her room.

Sakura finally woke up when she felt cold fingertips on her cheeks. She
smiled when she saw him, then pulled away from him as she remembered
the previous night. Syaoran looked away from Sakura with shame in his
eyes.

&quot;Gomen nasai Sakura. I never meant to hurt you or make you cry. Forgive
me please?&quot; He sounded so desperate Sakura thought. She knew he truly
regretted it but she didn&#39;t want to just go running back to him. &quot;I
love you,&quot; he said breaking the silence. &quot;I won&#39;t hurt you anymore. I&#39;m
just not good at this sort of thing.&quot;

Sakura smiled knowing just how true that was. &quot;I love you too,&quot; she
said as he took her in his arms. After a few minutes of silence Syaoran
started laughing as he remembered who was downstairs waiting to talk to
Tomoyo.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Sakura questioned.

Through his laughter Syaoran managed to tell Sakura that he found
someone who wanted to date Tomoyo and that they were downstairs talking
now. Sakura&#39;s eyes lit up at the possibility of her best friend finding
a new love. One that could give her what Sakura couldn&#39;t.

&quot;Are you serious? Who?&quot; Sakura began to pound her boyfriend with
questions.

&quot;Heh, well lets just say it&#39;s someone you know. She..&quot;

&quot;She?&quot; Sakura interrupted him.

&quot;Yes, she. She&#39;s someone you know. She&#39;s not shy at all. She&#39;s pretty
smart and always goes after what she wants. I don&#39;t know how or why,
but now she claims to have fallen for Tomoyo.&quot; Syaoran finished glad
that Tomoyo might finally have a reason to stop pining away for his
girlfriend.

_____________

&quot;You know I&#39;m not shy like my cousin, and I&#39;m not blind like Sakura.&quot;
Meiling said moving towards Tomoyo. She wasn&#39;t sure of what she was
doing exactly but she had a plan. &quot;I know your in love with her. Heck,
I&#39;m still in love with him. But both of us know we have to move on.
Please, love me instead of her. Give me a chance. I really like you
Tomoyo,&quot; Meiling said as she stopped in front of Tomoyo.

Tomoyo stood in shock not believing what her friend was saying. &quot;You
like me?&quot; Tomoyo asked not knowing what else to say. She loved Sakura,
and only Sakura.

&quot;Hai, suki desu.&quot; Meiling said as she sat down on the couch.

&quot;I.. I don&#39;t know what to tell you. I love Sakura still. I&#39;ve never
thought of you like that. You are beautiful but why would you want to
be with me when I&#39;m in love with her? And your in love with him?&quot;
Tomoyo was down right confused. She couldn&#39;t believe this was
happening.

&quot;I just want a chance. I know if you gave me a chance, we could learn
to love each other.&quot; Meiling said seriously. Of course she wasn&#39;t just
going to stop being in love with Syaoran, but if all worked out right,
everyone would be happy in the end.

Tomoyo on the other hand remembered what Sakura told her the night
before. That Sakura said she should really get over her. &#39;Whatever
makes Sakura happy makes me happy,&#39; Tomoyo thought. &quot;I&#39;ll do it,&quot; she
said to Meiling. &quot;You know I&#39;m not in love with you. And I know your
not in love with me. But it would be good for us to get over them. And
it would be nice if I did end up falling for you.&quot;

&quot;And it would be great to have you love me, because I know I&#39;ll fall
for you easily.&quot; Meiling said moving closer to Tomoyo.

&quot;There is just one condition,&quot; Tomoyo told her.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Your have to promise me you won&#39;t hurt me like your cousin hurts
Sakura.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll never hurt you,&quot; Meiling said moving her face just so it was
inches from Tomoyo&#39;s. &quot;I do like you a lot. I know I&#39;ve been kind of
cold to you and Sakura, but I really do care about the two of you.
Especially you. Your so amazing. I just never realized it before.&quot;

Tomoyo blushed at the compliment. &#39;This may not be too bad after all,&#39;
she thought. Noticing that no one was around, and just how close they
were to each other Tomoyo leaned forward slightly so that their lips
just barely brushed against the others. Meiling didn&#39;t pull away and
Tomoyo deepened the kiss.

&#39;Eww, she kissed me,&quot; Meiling thought. &#39;I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d actually
have to kiss her.&#39; Meiling already convinced her cousin she was falling
for Tomoyo, and now she finally convinced Tomoyo. She knew if things
didn&#39;t work out as she had planned she&#39;d be in big trouble, but she had
to risk it.

&quot;I&#39;ve never actually dated anyone before.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for giving this a chance Tomoyo. I know you probably think
I&#39;m immature and selfish, but there&#39;s a lot you don&#39;t know about me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m willing to learn about it all. I&#39;m glad we&#39;re doing this too.&quot;

&quot;So what do you want to do on our first day as a couple?&quot; Meiling asked
wrapping her arm around Tomoyo. Tomoyo leaned into her warm embrace.
The first thing she thought was how it was so different from Sakura&#39;s
arms. Then she realized she couldn&#39;t go on comparing Meiling to Sakura
or she&#39;d never get over her.

&quot;Let&#39;s go see what Sakura and Syaoran are doing in my room. I&#39;ve think
they&#39;ve had plenty of time to make up with each other by now.&quot;

&quot;Make out you mean?&quot; Meiling teased. She stood up bringing Tomoyo with
her and took Tomoyo&#39;s hand into her hand. &quot;This is definitely going to
take some time to get used to. But I think your well worth the effort.&quot;
Meiling said to Tomoyo just before they started heading up the stairs.

_______________

When Tomoyo and Meiling entered the room where Syaoran and Sakura were
everyone&#39;s mouth dropped. Sakura and Syaoran&#39;s because Meiling was
clinging to Tomoyo&#39;s arm protectively, and Meiling and Tomoyo&#39;s because
of seeing Sakura and Syaoran kissing so passionately.

Sakura and Syaoran immediately broke apart blushing deeply. &quot;So you
actually told her?&quot; Syaoran asked his cousin.

&quot;Hai, I&#39;m just glad everything worked out well.&quot; Meiling said as she
looked lovingly at Tomoyo. &#39;I don&#39;t know how long I can keep this up,&#39;
she thought.

&quot;Ne Meiling, can I talk to you for a minute in the hall?&quot; Sakura asked
as she stepped off of Tomoyo&#39;s bed. The two girls stepped outside of
the room and Sakura shut the door behind them. &quot;Alright, I know you.
Your straight. What are you doing dating my best friend?&quot; Sakura wasted
no time. She knew this couldn&#39;t be happening.

&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t I?&quot; Meiling knew this would be the perfect opportunity
to put her plan in motion. She was going to get Sakura and Tomoyo
together if it killed her. Then the fact that Syaoran would be single
afterwards was a definite perk of the whole idea.

&quot;Do you even care about her?&quot;

&quot;Why do you care?&quot; Meiling said agitating Sakura. She didn&#39;t mean to
sound like a bitch but it was the only way this would work.

&quot;Answer me, onegai. Do you really care about her? I just don&#39;t want her
to get hurt.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t hurt her. I&#39;m just lucky you never realized how much you love
her.&quot; Meiling stopped there not wanting to push the subject. She turned
and walked back into Tomoyo&#39;s room. After a few minutes Sakura finally
recovered out in the hall and came back into the room as well. &#39;What
did she mean by that?&#39; was her last calm thought as she saw Meiling
look at her then kiss her friend.

&#39;She&#39;s kissing Tomoyo. Why does this bother me? Is it because I&#39;ve
never seen two girls kiss? No, that bitch is kissing my best friend. I
want to scream at her. To tell her to leave MY Tomoyo alone. Matte,
what am I thinking? She&#39;s not mine. I just don&#39;t want to lose her. I
need her to much. What&#39;s going on? Hoe.&#39; Sakura had no idea what was
going on in her mind. She had Syaoran to love. She was in love with
him, wasn&#39;t she?

&quot;Gomen ne minna. I have to go and uh.. go home and do some school work.
I&#39;ll talk to you later.&quot; Sakura said suddenly walking out of Tomoyo&#39;s
room. When she was out of eyesight she ran out of the house to make
sure she was alone. Tomoyo tried running after her friend but Meiling
took hold of her hand and stopped her.

&quot;Daijoubu Tomoyo. She&#39;s fine,&quot; Meiling hoped if Sakura had time alone
she would think of what just happened and hopefully come to terms with
her real feelings for Tomoyo. &#39;Onegai kami-sama. Let this work out.&#39;
Meiling said under her breath. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go out somewhere.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Tomoyo agreed trying to get her mind off of Sakura. She didn&#39;t
know what, but something was definitely wrong with Sakura.

_____________

Once Sakura was alone she just kept walking around trying to figure
some things out. She had no reason to be against Meiling dating Tomoyo
but it bothered her deeply. She knew if she asked Tomoyo to not see
Meiling she wouldn&#39;t see her anymore. Then Sakura knew she would feel
bad. Almost as if she was using Tomoyo.

She never realized how much she needed Tomoyo. Tomoyo was always there
whenever she needed her. Now what if Tomoyo wasn&#39;t around anymore? What
if Tomoyo didn&#39;t need her anymore?

&quot;I&#39;m being selfish. I just want Tomoyo to love me even though I don&#39;t
love her. But why?&quot; Sakura said to no one. &quot;Maybe I should just talk to
her. But then what if I blew this for her? She finally found someone to
make her happy when I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Sakura-chan?&quot; A familiar voice scared her out of her thoughts.
&quot;Daijoubu desu ka?&quot; the voice asked when Sakura didn&#39;t answer him.

&quot;Yukito-san,&quot; Sakura turned around to face her friend. &quot;Gomen ne, you
scared me.&quot;

&quot;Why are you talking to yourself Sakura? And why are you crying?&quot;
Yukito asked her, the concern evident in his voice.

&quot;I&#39;m crying?&quot; Sakura asked as she lifted her hand to her face and felt
the wet tears on her cheeks. &quot;I...I didn&#39;t know I was. I don&#39;t know
what&#39;s going on at all anymore.&quot;

&quot;Something you want to talk about?&quot; Yukito asked her as he sat down on
a nearby bench.

Sakura sat down next to him and began to tell him what happened
earlier. &quot;..And now I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot; she finished her story.
Yukito was definitely shocked. He knew Meiling was right, she was in
love with Tomoyo and just hasn&#39;t realized it yet.

&quot;So you realize how much you need her to be around for you?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s the only one I can turn to. She always makes me smile no matter
how bad things are. But if she&#39;s with Meiling all the time who will I
turn to?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;I understand where your coming from,&quot; Yukito said as he remembered a
situation similar to this he was once in. A situation that made him
realize his true feelings for this girls older brother. &quot;Why do you
feel selfish for needing her?&quot;

&quot;Because if I tell her how much I do, she&#39;ll never stop loving me. She
should move on since I love Syaoran but in a way I don&#39;t want her to I
just can&#39;t seem to make her happy.. Hoe, I&#39;m so confused.&quot;

&quot;You are confused, but not about what you think. You just have one
simple thing backwards. It&#39;ll be very easy for you to make her happy
once you figure that out.&quot; Yukito said as he stood up. &quot;Well I gotta go
meet your brother so I&#39;ll see you later Sakura-chan.&quot;

&quot;Backwards?&quot; Sakura said to him as he started to walk away.

Yukito just shook his head and smiled. Over his shoulder he just told
her it was something she had to figure out on her own. &#39;Backwards?&#39; she
thought to herself. &#39;What&#39;s backwards? He was of no help at all.&#39;

Sakura sat on the bench still and let her mind drift back to the
previous night. Her fight with Syaoran and how she came straight to
Tomoyo. How Tomoyo let her cry in her arms and held her all night so
she&#39;d feel better. Who was going to make her feel better if Tomoyo was
always with Meiling. Who was going to make her happy?

Now she thought of her talk with Meiling and how Meiling told her she
was lucky she didn&#39;t realize her true feelings for her friend. How much
it hurt to see someone kissing Tomoyo. As if someone were taking the
air out of the room so she couldn&#39;t breathe. &#39;My Tomoyo&#39; she thought to
herself.

&#39;Now if I only knew what Meiling and Yukito are thinking. My true
feelings for Tomoyo. And having something backwards?&#39; Sakura didn&#39;t
bother to stop thinking about the whole situation as she walked home.
Finally as she reached her house she figured out what the two of them
meant. &#39;Do they mean I have my true feelings backwards? But how are
they backwards?&#39;

Sakura took a break from her thoughts as she greeted her father and
walked up to her room. As soon as she laid down in her bed she let all
her thoughts come back to her. &#39;Now how are my feelings backwards? I
love Tomoyo and I&#39;m in love with Syaoran. Tomoyo&#39;s my best friend and
she&#39;s always been there for me. I&#39;ve come to depend on her so much. If
I didn&#39;t have her who would I go to when Syaoran gets mad at me? He
does that a lot lately.&#39; Sakura frowned as she looked at her nightstand
that had a picture of her and her boyfriend.

&#39;He gets mad at me and whenever I&#39;m upset I go to her. She&#39;s always
there for me because she loves me. More than anyone or anything else
she loves me. And all this time I&#39;ve never realized how amazing she
is.&#39;

___________

&quot;I can&#39;t do this Meiling. Gomen.&quot; Tomoyo said as she stood next to her
new girlfriend. &quot;I can&#39;t love anyone but Sakura or pretend to. I don&#39;t
even want to try to love anyone else. I like being your friend but I
can&#39;t be more with you.&quot;

&#39;Perfect,&#39; Meiling thought trying not to smile. &quot;Oh,&quot; is all she said
as she bowed her head so Tomoyo couldn&#39;t see her face. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I
asked you then.&quot;

&quot;Daijoubu Meiling. Besides, your a really good kisser.&quot; Tomoyo told her
friend getting a laugh from her. &quot;I hate to do this but I gotta go see
Sakura.&quot;

Tell her I say hi will ya?&quot; Meiling gave Tomoyo a farewell hug and
Tomoyo took off towards Sakura&#39;s house. So far Meiling thought things
were going perfect. She had her chance to make her impression on Sakura
and no one got hurt in the process. Tomoyo was still happy and now it
was in Sakura&#39;s hands. All she had to do was figure out who she loved.

As Tomoyo reached Sakura&#39;s house she noticed Syaoran was arriving there
at the same time. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he asked her as they
stopped in front of the house.

&quot;I was coming to make sure Sakura was okay.&quot; Tomoyo told him as she
walked up to the door and went to knock on it.

&quot;Well I&#39;m here so you don&#39;t have to worry. She doesn&#39;t need you so you
might as well go home.&quot;

&quot;But..&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine. Just go home, I&#39;ll take care of her.&quot; Syaoran told her.
Tomoyo was deeply hurt but didn&#39;t say anything. She turned around and
started walking towards her home. Syaoran knew he was being mean but he
couldn&#39;t risk losing his girlfriend to her. He knew, just like everyone
else, just how much Sakura loved Tomoyo. In fact that&#39;s why he got so
upset and fought with Sakura. Because his girlfriend would rather be
with Tomoyo than him. He didn&#39;t mean to show Sakura it upset him but
sometimes she could tell he was mad about something. And she always ran
to Tomoyo.

Once Sakura opened the door she didn&#39;t know if she should be relieved
to see her boyfriend or not. Syaoran could tell she had been crying and
immediately took her in his arms. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m here for you
Sakura.&quot;

Sakura wrapped her arms around him and let him hold onto her. It felt
so good to be in his arms. She always felt protected when he held her.
It was different from when Tomoyo did. Tomoyo&#39;s arms were loving, and
soft. When Tomoyo held her all her troubles seemed to go away. Sakura
closed her eyes and pictured Tomoyo holding her and just thinking of it
she felt better. She had almost forgotten her boyfriend was even there.

&quot;You feel better now?&quot; Syaoran asked as he felt Sakura relax in his
arms after a few moments.

&quot;Yes, I do thank you.&quot; she said as she came back to reality.

&quot;I saw Tomoyo on the way here too,&quot; Syaoran told her. &quot;She was worried
about you as well but I told her that you wouldn&#39;t need her since I&#39;m
here so she went home.&quot; He felt Sakura tense in his arms and knew he
just made a fatal mistake.

&quot;You told her I don&#39;t need her?&quot;

&quot;Un.&quot; was all that would come out of his mouth.

&quot;I always need her. I always will. I can&#39;t live without her. I have to
go see her. I&#39;m sorry Syaoran.&quot;

He bowed his head as she pulled away from him. He lost, he knew there
was no hope of holding on to her any longer. &quot;Tell her how much you
love her for me will you?&quot; Sakura hugged him tightly and smiled.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry. I just figured it all out. What everyone&#39;s been
trying to tell me. I&#39;m in love with her. I have to go.&quot; Sakura said as
she ran out her front door after her friend leaving Syaoran standing in
her living room.

After what seemed like hours of endless running she got to Tomoyo&#39;s
house and as soon as she was let in she ran straight to Tomoyo&#39;s room.
She didn&#39;t bother to knock as she ran into Tomoyo&#39;s room and stopped
dead in her tracks when she saw Tomoyo sitting on the floor crying.

Slowly she walked over to her friend who didn&#39;t seem to notice her
until Sakura sat down beside her. &quot;I never meant to hurt you Tomoyo.
I&#39;ll always need you, and now I need you more than ever.&quot;

Tomoyo stopped herself from crying. She always found it weird how
Sakura just popped into her room without her noticing. &quot;I don&#39;t
understand what your talking about Sakura.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m talking about what&#39;s been going on today. How in the course of one
day my entire life has completely changed. I realized when I saw you
with Meiling how much I need you. I thought I was just jealous because
you wouldn&#39;t be around as much if you were with her. Then I talked to
Yukito and after a lot of thought and I realized I was scared.&quot;

&quot;Why were you scared?&quot;

&quot;Well Meiling likes you and your her girlfriend now and I thought I was
going to lose you, and not have the chance to love you.&quot;

&quot;I told Meiling a while ago that this wouldn&#39;t work, because I could
never love anyone but you.&quot;

&quot;And I realized just how in love with you I am thanks to her and
Yukito.&quot; Sakura said as she placed a hand on top of Tomoyo&#39;s. &quot;I love
you Tomoyo, with all my heart. I realized that you love me more than
anyone ever has before, and I wasn&#39;t really in love with Syaoran. I was
meant to be with you, I just hope it&#39;s not to late.&quot;

Tomoyo&#39;s eyes filled with tears as she realized what Sakura was saying
to her. Her dream had finally come true, Sakura was in love with her.
&quot;I love you Sakura.&quot;

&quot;I love you Tomoyo,&quot; Sakura leaned forward and kissed Tomoyo softly.
&quot;I&#39;ll never hurt you again. I promise you that.&quot; Sakura kissed Tomoyo
again as she took Tomoyo into her arms and the two stayed in that
position for the rest of the night content knowing they finally found
their true love.

___________

When Syaoran told Meiling about Sakura finally realizing her true
feelings for Tomoyo and how she ran off Meiling felt proud. She wanted
to tell her cousin about her plan but knew he would never forgive her
if she did. &quot;It wasn&#39;t so bad you know.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Syaoran asked looking at his cousin.

&quot;Dating Tomoyo wasn&#39;t to bad. I&#39;m kinda upset it didn&#39;t work out.&quot;

&quot;You always told me they would end up together and not to go out with
Sakura.&quot;

&quot;I knew they loved each other yes, but I didn&#39;t know they&#39;d actually
get together. I just told you not to date her because I wanted you to
date me.&quot;

&quot;So what do I do now that she left me? I knew it would happen sooner or
later so I&#39;m not too upset, but it really sucks.&quot;

&quot;You can always date me.&quot; Meiling added clinging to his arm.

&quot;Aren&#39;t we a little old for that now? It was fine when we were kids but
I think we&#39;re a little to old for that.&quot;

&quot;Who says? We were supposed to get married when we were little. Then
you came here from Hong Kong and threw it all off. So if we can get
married why can&#39;t we date?&quot;

&quot;Yare yare. Whatever you want Meiling.&quot; Syaoran said falling onto the
couch. He was much to tired and confused to care. Meiling sat down next
to him and grabbed his arm again. Meiling was definitely proud of
herself for what she did. It was one hell of a day for all four of them
and she desperately wanted to tell someone of her great plan and how well
it worked out. &quot;Some things are best left unsaid.&quot; Meiling thought
aloud.

&quot;Nani?&quot; Syaoran looked at her confused.

&quot;Nan demo nai!&quot;Meiling said with a nervous laugh. She hadn&#39;t meant to
say that out loud. &quot;Well I&#39;m going to bed. See you tomorrow Syaoran.&quot;
Meiling stood up and kissed her cousin on the forehead and took off.

&quot;Some things never change no matter how much you want them to I guess.&quot;
Syaoran thought before going to his own bed for the night.
