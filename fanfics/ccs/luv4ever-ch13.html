<h1>Love Forever (part 13 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Sakura yawned and stretched as she started to wake from what had to be 
one of the worst nights sleep she had in recent memory. The last time 
she slept this bad was in Hong Kong the night before she returned to 
Japan. Before she returned to the people that truly care for and love 
her. She was going to get up when she noticed Tomoyo sleeping with her 
head on her legs.

&quot;She looks like an angel.&quot; Sakura whispered to herself.

She ran her fingers through Tomoyo&#39;s lovely lavender hair and gently 
rubbed her back. She slowly leaned Tomoyo back in her chair so she 
wouldn&#39;t wake her. Sakura took a blanket from the foot of her bed and 
draped it over her sleeping beauty. She leaned in and gave her a kiss on 
the cheek.

&quot;Sleep tight Tomoyo-chan. May you dream the most beautiful dreams.&quot;

Since she couldn&#39;t sleep, Sakura decided to walk around the floor a few 
times to see if that would tire her out. She came across a small waiting 
area at the end of the hall and walked up to the window. She sighed a 
tired sigh as she looked out at all of the twinkling lights of the city 
below. She stood there for hours, just staring at the night sky. Tomoyo 
woke up and noticed that Sakura was gone. After checking the Washroom, 
she headed out into the hall to check with the nurses station. She 
turned to the left, but something in her mind told her to look right. 
She did and noticed Sakura looking out the window. She sighed in relief 
and walked down the hall to see if she was ok. She wrapped her arms 
around Sakura&#39;s stomach and hugged her from behind.

&quot;Sakura-chan? Are you ok?&quot;

Sakura quickly wiped away her tears and told her she was fine.

&quot;You don&#39;t look like it.&quot;

&quot;I guess all the emotions from what happened tonight hit me all at once. 
I know I can be a bit dense with these things sometimes. I was so scared 
Tomoyo-chan. I almost lost you tonight.&quot;

Tomoyo burried her face in Sakura&#39;s hair and listened as the young card 
mistress poured her heart out.

&quot;But you didn&#39;t lose me Sakura-chan. That&#39;s all that matters.&quot;

&quot;Yeah but...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t focus on things that might have happened, the thing that matters 
most is that we&#39;re both ok. We still have each other...right?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right. I&#39;m sorry. I just don&#39;t know what I would do if I lost 
you.&quot;

&quot;Nor I you.&quot;

Sakura turned around and gave Tomoyo the biggest hug she could muster. 
Nearly squeezing the life out of her in the process. Tomoyo took her 
hand and started leading her back to her room.

&quot;Come on... Sakura-chan needs her beauty sleep.&quot;

Sakura just whined and pouted that she wanted to go home.

&quot;The sooner you get some sleep, the sooner tomorrow will come and we can 
go home.&quot;

After tucking her into bed and giving her a kiss goodnight, Tomoyo 
pulled out a sketchbook and started making designs of her and Sakura&#39;s 
wedding dresses. They wanted to have the wedding before the baby 
arrived, but with their lives being so busy as of late, it looked as 
though that might not happen. Tomoyo got a wide eyed starry look and 
steeled her resolve that she would make sure the wedding would take 
place before their little girl was born, and got to work. She stayed up 
long into the night until her body eventually gave in to it&#39;s need for 
sleep. She practically collapsed on the bed next to Sakura&#39;s and fell 
into a deep slumber. It was early afternoon when one of the Nurses came 
in and woke them. Tomoyo helped Sakura gather her things, and get ready 
to go home. On the wasy past the nurses station, Tomoyo gave them the 
flowers that were in Sakura&#39;s room, and thanked them for all their hard 
work in helping to take care of Sakura. She wheeled Sakura out to 
Touya&#39;s car, buckled her in and sat down beside her with her head on 
Sakura&#39;s shoulder. Fujitaka had suggested that they stay at his place 
until repairs were completed at their apartment.

&quot;Arigato Kinomoto-san.&quot; Said Tomoyo.

They were thrilled when they got to Sakura&#39;s room. Nothing had changed 
since she moved to Hong Kong. Her father had kept her room exactly as it 
had been when she was still living there. Sakura walked over to her bed 
and picked up the little Plushie of herself that Tomoyo had made for her 
when they were younger. She hugged it tightly and sneezed when some dust 
went up her nose. Tomoyo giggled and said that they should get cleaned 
up before Dinner. A little while later, Touya yelled that dinner was 
ready from downstairs.

&quot;Hai!&quot;

&quot;So? Have you figured out when you want to have the wedding Tomoyo?&quot; 
Asked Touya.

&quot;Well... we really want to be married before the baby arrives, so I was 
thinking that maybe we should have it pretty soon. Don&#39;t you think so 
Sakura-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hai. But we have so much to do, and such little time to do it. We&#39;ve 
got Flowers and Invitations, Catering and the Dresses... Hoeeee, keeping 
track of so many things makes my head dizzy.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Sakura. We&#39;ll all pitch in and help too. Won&#39;t we... 
Touya?&quot; Said Yukito.

&quot;Well, since she&#39;s not marrying that Gaki, I guess we can help out a 
little.&quot;</pre>
