<h1>Sakura and Tomoyo</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>In this story, Sakura and Tomoyo are about 13. 

 

RIIIINNNNNNNNNG! Went the final bell of the day. 

&quot;Sakura?... Sakura?&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot; 

&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear the bell?&quot; Asked Tomoyo. 

&quot;No... sorry Tomoyo-chan. I&#39;ve just got alot on my mind... that&#39;s all.&quot; 

Tomoyo had a worried look on her face. Sakura had been acting strange 
for a few days and she knew it wasn&#39;t something small. &quot;It&#39;s probably 
about Li-kun.&quot; She thought, a little bit of sadness, and yes, even a 
little bitterness towards Sayoran came over her. She shook her head. 
&quot;No! As long as she&#39;s happy with him, that&#39;s all that matters.&quot; 

&quot;You ready to go Tomoyo?&quot; Asked Sakura. 

&quot;Yes, let&#39;s get going shall we?&quot; 

The two of them walked towards Sakura&#39;s house, not saying much to each 
other as they did. Each girl had too much to think about to talk to the 
other. They ended up passing Sakura&#39;s house before Tomoyo noticed. 

&quot;See you later Sakura.&quot; 

&quot;Hoe? Oh...yeah, see you later Tomoyo.&quot; 

Sakura didn&#39;t even announce that she was home when she walked in. 
Instead, she went straight to her room. 

&quot;Hey Kaiju. How was your day?&quot; Asked Touya as she passed him on the 
stairs. She just ignored him and kept walking. She opened her door and 
threw herself on the bed, crying into her pillow. Kero heard her come in 
and flew to her side. 

&quot;What&#39;s the matter Sakura?&quot; 

&quot;Kero-chan... I&#39;m sorry but can I be alone for a while? I need to 
think.&quot; 

&quot;Sure... I think I&#39;ll go for a little fly down to the bakery and look at 
all the tasty treats in the window.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks Kero.&quot; 

Sakura laid there on her bed with her face in her pillow and berated 
herself for not having the courage to tell her how she felt. Touya had 
his ear to her door and could make out a few of her self insults between 
sobs. He felt a lump in his throat growing as she kept crying. He had 
enough. He stood up, took a deep breath and gently rapped on her door. 

&quot;Co... come in.&quot; She said while wiping away the tears on her face. 

&quot;Kaiju? Are you ok?&quot; He said while opening the door and peeking in. 

&quot;Onii-chan... I couldn&#39;t do it. I couldn&#39;t tell her.&quot; 

He sat down on her bed and hugged her. 

&quot;Tell who, what?&quot; 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan. I couldn&#39;t tell her my feelings.&quot; 

&quot;Your feelings for her?&quot; 

She clutched his shirt and started bawling. 

&quot;I...I&#39;m such a coward! I love... I love her so much! I&#39;m scared that... 
if I tell her, she&#39;ll hate me! I can&#39;t lose her!&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s ok Sakura. I&#39;m sure that Tomoyo feels the same way. She probably 
thinks the same thing when she looks at you.&quot; 

Her tears continue to fall and she keeps spilling her feelings for 
Tomoyo to her brother. He&#39;s always been there for her. To comfort and 
protect her. He was there when their mother died, he was there when she 
would be picked on at school, he was there when her and Sayoran broke 
up. No matter what happened, he was there to help. 

&quot;Sakura... I&#39;m not sure what I can say that will help. This is something 
that I don&#39;t think I can help you with. The only person that can help 
you is yourself.&quot; 

His words stuck with her as she kept crying into his chest. Even though 
he was mean sometimes, his words always comforted her. Slowly, she 
calmed down and stopped crying. She pulled away from him and sniffled as 
he wiped away her tears. She hugged him tightly and said that she loved 
him. 

&quot;I&#39;m going over to Yukito&#39;s place tonight, and Dad&#39;s still away on his 
dig, so why don&#39;t you ask if you can sleep over at Tomoyo-chan&#39;s 
tonight?&quot; 

Sakura blushed and thought about it for a moment as Touya got up and 
headed for the door. She told herself that this would be a good chance 
to tell her and she took it. She picked up her pink cell phone and 
punched in Tomoyo&#39;s number. 

&quot;Hello... Daidouji residence.&quot; One of the Maid&#39;s answered. 

&quot;Hello. This is Sakura Kinomoto. Is Tomoyo there?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that she&#39;s up in her room sleeping right now. Can I take a 
message?&quot; 

&quot;No, that&#39;s ok. Would it be alright if I came to see her?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, I think so. She asked me to wake her when her Mother came home, 
and she&#39;s due back any time now.&quot; 

&quot;Great, I&#39;ll be right over then.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll make some tea and have it ready for you and the little Miss when 
you arrive.&quot; 

&quot;Thank You.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re welcome Miss Kinomoto.&quot; 

CLICK. 

Sakura hadn&#39;t yet gotten permission to stay the night, so she didn&#39;t 
pack anything as she got ready to leave. She told Touya where she was 
going and headed downstairs. She strapped on her Rollerblades and bolted 
for Tomoyo&#39;s. When she arrived, she was greeted by one of the Bodyguards 
and asked to wait inside. She sat on the couch and waited. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Miss Kinomoto. I haven&#39;t woken her up yet.&quot; One of the Maids 
said while bowing. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Do you mind if I wake her?&quot; 

&quot;No, not at all. I think she&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.&quot; 

Sakura blushed and giggled nervously at the comment. She turned and 
headed up the stairs towards Tomoyo&#39;s room. She quietly opened the door 
and crept to her friends side. She leaned over and whispered into her 
ear. 

&quot;Wake up Tomoyo-chan, I have something I need to tell you.&quot; 

Tomoyo stirred but didn&#39;t wake. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan...&quot; 

Tears started to flow down Sakura&#39;s cheek as she tried to gather the 
courage to tell her. Two drops fell onto Tomoyo&#39;s cheek, which was just 
enough to startle her a bit and wake her from her slumber. She quickly 
sat up in her bed and looked at her friend. 

&quot;Sakura-chan? What&#39;s wrong? Why are you crying?&quot; 

She took Sakura&#39;s face in her hands and looked into her glassy Emerald 
eyes. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan...&quot; 

Sakura couldn&#39;t contain herself any more. She leaned forward and planted 
her lips onto Tomoyo&#39;s, startling her. She held her in a deep kiss until 
she had to take a breath. She released Tomoyo and started to sob. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan... I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; She cried as she looked away and blushed. 

Tomoyo put her fingers on her lips and her eyes swelled as she heard her 
friends words. Tomoyo wished that they could have stayed like that 
forever. She wanted the taste of Sakura&#39;s sweet lips on her own for all 
eternity. She looked toward her friend and started to speak. 

&quot;Sakura... I love you too.&quot; 

Shocked at those words, Sakura turned to face Tomoyo but was drawn into 
another deep kiss. This one even more passionate than the last. When 
they broke, they embraced each other and cried until there was a knock 
on the door. 

&quot;Come in.&quot; Said Tomoyo as they both wiped away their tears. 

&quot;Mother! I thoutht that you had to stay late at the office again!?&quot; 

&quot;I did, but I heard that Sakura was coming over and decided to come home 
early. Well that, and I wanted to spend time with you and do something 
special to make up for all the nights I&#39;ve been working late.&quot; 

Tomoyo got up and ran to hug her Mom. 

&quot;Thank You Mom! This day couldn&#39;t get any better!&quot; 

&quot;Huh? What do you mean?&quot; 

Tomoyo blushed and quickly told her it was nothing. 

&quot;Ok, well I have to make a few calls to make sure I&#39;m not disturbed 
while I&#39;m with you two, and I want to plan something special so I&#39;ll 
come back when I&#39;m done.&quot; 

&quot;Ok. We&#39;ll be here.&quot; 

Sonomi left and headed downstairs to her office to get started. 

&quot;I&#39;m exhausted!&quot; Exclaimed Sakura as she sat down and started rubbing 
her shoulders. Tomoyo sat down beside her and took over for Sakura. 

&quot;Oh! That feels good Tomoyo-chan.&quot;  

&quot;You were really stressing yourself about this weren&#39;t you Sakura-chan?&quot; 

&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; She said with her eyes closed. 

&quot;Hey! I know! Why don&#39;t we take a soak in the Hot-tub?&quot; Asked Tomoyo. 

Sakura blushed and said that she&#39;d love to as they headed for the Master 
Bath. Tomoyo&#39;s bathroom was huge! There was the standard Bathroom stuff: 
Toilet, Towel rack, Mirror, etc, etc. But what really caught Sakura&#39;s 
attention were the solid Marble Twin sinks, the Multi headed shower, and 
of course, the Hot-tub. Which looked like it could fit about 40 people!  

&quot;This is beautiful Tomoyo-chan!&quot; 

&quot;Oh that&#39;s right! You&#39;ve never seen the Master Bath before have you?&quot; 

&quot;No. And it&#39;s awesome!&quot; 

Tomoyo blushed and said that her Mother had it renovated after she was 
born. 

&quot;So... I guess this&#39;ll be the first time we see each other naked huh?&quot; 
Said Tomoyo while laughing. 

Sakura blushed at the thought of seeing Tomoyo&#39;s naked body. 

&quot;Ye...yeah.&quot; 

There was a long silence... 

&quot;Do you want me to go first?&quot; Asked Tomoyo. 

&quot;No no. I&#39;m sorry, I was just thinking. I&#39;ll go first.&quot; 

Sakura&#39;s mind was racing. 

&quot;Will Tomoyo like what she sees? Will she think I&#39;m ugly?&quot; She thought 
as she undid her shirt. 

Tomoyo just stood there as still as a tree. Watching. 

Sakura sighed as she took off her shirt and threw it on the floor. Her 
blush deepened as she undid her shorts and slid them down to her ankles. 

&quot;Why am I so shy?&quot; She thought to herself. She let Tomoyo take 
measurements of her before, but she always took them while Sakura was in 
her Gym clothes or some other type of clothing that was fairly tight. 
Tomoyo had never seen her in just her underwear before. She took a few 
more deep breaths before reaching around and unhooking her bra. She slid 
the straps down her arms and held the bra in place with her hand for a 
few seconds before she closed her eyes and dropped it. She opened her 
eyes to see Tomoyo smiling at her, which made her feel a little more 
comfortable. Even though she knew it was impossible, she felt her cheeks 
redden even more as she slipped her plain, white cotton Panties down and 
stepped out of them. She clasped her hands in front of her and waited 
for Tomoyo&#39;s reaction. 

Nothing. 

&quot;To...Tomoyo-chan?&quot; 

&quot;Sorry... I was just overwhelmed by your beauty Sakura-chan.&quot; 

Sakura was sure that she could fry an egg on her face from all the heat 
that had built up from her blushing. 

&quot;Your turn Tomoyo-chan.&quot; She said bashfully. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I want to do this.&quot; Said Tomoyo. 

&quot;Hey! Here I am standing here in my Birthday Suit and you want to 
chicken out!? That&#39;s not fair!&quot; 

&quot;Relax, I&#39;m only kidding. You&#39;re just so cute when you&#39;re angry!&quot; 

Sakura blushed again and said: &quot;I am not!&quot; 

Tomoyo laughed and traded places with Sakura. 

Sakura thought that she would pass out if any more blood went to her 
cheeks as she watched Tomoyo start to undress. Tomoyo reached behind her 
and unzipped her dress as she stood before her new found lover. She slid 
her arms out and let the dress rest on her hips, exposing her bright 
pink bra. She slid the dress to the floor, exposing her matching 
Panties. She stood up and looked at Sakura, who was still blushing and 
holding her Left hand to her chest, feeling her heart beat faster and 
faster. Tomoyo slowly lifted her bra above her head, causing her breasts 
to lift, then bounce a little as they fell back into place. She threw 
her bra on the floor and put her hands on her hips and sighed nervously. 

&quot;It&#39;s ok Tomoyo-chan.&quot; Sakura said reassuringly. 

Tomoyo took a deep breath as she put her thumbs in the waistband of her 
Panties and lowered them. She stepped out of them and threw them in the 
pile of clothes beside her. She raised her arms out to her sides and 
waited for Sakura to say something. 

Sakura just stared at her. She couldn&#39;t believe how lovely she was. Her 
deep red face gave her pale skin a contrast that couldn&#39;t be described. 

&quot;Lovely... absoulutley lovely.&quot; Said Sakura, causing Tomoyo&#39;s blush to 
deepen even further. 

&quot;Thank You.&quot;  

Sakura walked over and hugged her lover tightly. They got goosebumps 
when they realized how chilly it was and decided they should get in the 
nice hot water of the tub. 

&quot;Wait!&quot; Said Tomoyo. Sakura was puzzled. She stood back and watched as 
Tomoyo pulled something out of a cupboard and walked back over to the 
tub. Sakura felt tingly all over as she watched Tomoyo bend over and 
pour something into the water. She snuck up behind her, put her hands 
around her waist and placed her front against Tomoyo&#39;s backside which 
startled Tomoyo, causing her to quickly stand up and bonk her head on 
Sakura&#39;s. 

&quot;OW!&quot; They cried. They turned to each other and laughed while rubbing 
their heads. 

&quot;Come on!&quot; Said Tomoyo as she grabbed Sakura&#39;s hand and led her to the 
edge of the tub, which was now filled with bubbles. They swung their 
legs over and slid into the tub, careful as to not burn their bottoms. 
Tomoyo sat down and leaned against the wall. 

&quot;Ahhhhhh! This feel great!&quot; She said while closing her eyes. She opened 
them to find Sakura gone. 

&quot;Sakura? Where&#39;d you go?&quot; Her face changed from puzzled to one of a 
little concern as Sakura hadn&#39;t appeared in almost a minute. Tomoyo 
stood up and looked around again. 

&quot;BOO!&quot; Yelled Sakura as she jumped up from under the bubbles. 

&quot;EEEK!&quot; 

&quot;Sakura! Don&#39;t do that!&quot; Scolded Tomoyo. 

Sakura couldn&#39;t stop laughing and was met with a splash to the face. 

&quot;Oh. You wanna fight huh?&quot; She said as she splashed Tomoyo back. This 
went on for several minutes until they were out of breath. They sat down 
beside each other. Sakura&#39;s head on Tomoyo&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot; 

&quot;What is it?&quot; 

&quot;Thank You.&quot; 

&quot;For what Sakura-chan? 

&quot;For being my Girlfriend.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re very welcome my little Sakura-chan.&quot; 

Sakura smiled at those words and melted into a world that she never 
wanted to leave. Eventually, both girls fell asleep. Their arms around 
each others shoulders. 

Sonomi headed upstairs to let the girls know her plans for the evening 
but couldn&#39;t find them when she entered Tomoyo&#39;s room. She checked 
Tomoyo&#39;s bathroom but there was nothing there. She headed back into the 
hall when she heard the motor for the Hot-tub running. 

&quot;Oh. They&#39;re in the Master bath!&quot; 

She stepped in and saw what had to be the cutest thing that she had ever 
seen. Sakura and Tomoyo asleep in each other embrace. She walked over 
and stood behind them. She gave them each a kiss and tried waking them. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan... Sakura-chan?&quot; 

They slowly awoke and leaned their heads back to look straight up at 
Sonomi. 

&quot;Good afternoon sleepy heads!&quot; She said cheerfully. 

&quot;HOEEEEEEEEE!&quot; Sakura cried as she ducked underwater to hide her 
nakedness. 

Sonomi and Tomoyo looked at each other and laughed. Sakura blushed and 
said that she was sorry. 

&quot;For what?&quot; Sonomi asked. &quot;Loving my Tomoyo?&quot; 

Her face flushed again as she nodded sheepishly. 

&quot;Come on.&quot; She said, motioning Sakura to come closer. 

&quot;It&#39;s ok. You don&#39;t have to be embarassed.&quot; 

Sakura couldn&#39;t help it. Only her Dad and brother had seen her naked. 
And that was when she was little. Well, them and now Tomoyo. 

Sonomi took Sakura&#39;s chin in her hand and looked into her eyes. 

&quot;Thank You. You really do love Tomoyo. Don&#39;t you?&quot; 

She gave Sakura a kiss on the cheek and stood up. 

&quot;I told you girls I&#39;d be up when I figured out what we were going to do 
tonight, and I thought we might all go out for dinner.&quot; 

Tomoyo chirped at this and said: &quot;Can Sakura wear that special outfit I 
made for her?&quot; 

&quot;Of course! Now come on, it&#39;s time you two got out. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll 
end up looking like two dried up old Prunes!&quot; She said while picking up 
the girls clothes. 

&quot;Sakura... did you bring a change of clothes with you?&quot; 

&quot;N... no ma&#39;am&quot; Sakura said while blushing at the fact that Tomoyo&#39;s Mom 
was picking up her underwear. Sonomi noticed this and smiled. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Sakura-chan. I see Tomoyo&#39;s underwear all the time when I 
do Laundry.&quot; 

&quot;MOM! You&#39;re embarassing me!&quot; Said Tomoyo. Her face now a deep red 
color. 

&quot;We might be rich, but we&#39;re not snobs who need someone else to do 
everything for us. Doing the Laundry or a few chores makes us feel good. 
Like we&#39;re actually doing something useful, rather than just ordering 
others to do the same thing.&quot; 

&quot;Tomoyo... make sure that Sakura has everything that she needs. Ok?&quot; 

&quot;Sure!&quot; 

Sonomi handed them some towels as they got out of the tub and said that 
she would be downstairs when they were finished. Tomoyo and Sakura 
wrapped the towels around themselves and went back to Tomoyo&#39;s room. 

&quot;Wait here.&quot; Said Tomoyo. She ran to her closet and opened one side. 

Inside were rows and rows of dresses, skirts and other cute outfits. 

&quot;I made all of these especially for you Sakura-chan! But none of these 
will do for tonight.&quot; 

She walked into the closet to a shelf that had a large box on it. Tomoyo 
picked it up and walked back to Sakura. 

&quot;Here. Open it.&quot; 

Sakura carefully took off the bright yellow ribbon and opened the box. 
Inside was a beautiful Mint green dress with lots of frills and a bow in 
the middle. Sakura stared at it with awe. 

&quot;It&#39;s perfect.&quot;  

Tomoyo squealed at the fact Sakura loved it and said: &quot;Wait until you 
see mine.&quot;  

She brought out another box and opened it. It was the exact same dress. 
Only this one was a Canary yellow color. Tomoyo stared at Sakura looking 
at her dress and asked: &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to put it on?&quot; 

Sakura blushed and said: &quot;I can&#39;t... your Mom took our clothes 
remember?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah...so?&quot; 

&quot;So, I don&#39;t have any clean underwear.&quot; 

Tomoyo looked at her and laughed. 

&quot;You think that I would leave out such an important detail?&quot; 

Sakura&#39;s blush deepened. 

Tomoyo walked over and opened up the other side of her closet. Sakura 
was stunned at what she saw.  

&quot;You... did you make all of ths for me too!?&quot; 

Tomoyo just smiled and said that she was worth it. Sakura couldn&#39;t 
believe it! There seemed to be no end to it! Racks and racks of 
underwear in every color, fabric, and style ever known! Even some things 
that Sakura could never see herself wearing. 

Tomoyo walked in and picked out a bra and a pair of Panties that 
perfectly matched Sakura&#39;s dress. Sakura walked in behind her and looked 
through the assortment of unmentionables. 

&quot;Um... Tomoyo-chan?&quot; She said while holding up a black lace bra and 
thong panties. 

&quot;Ah-ah! That naughty thing is for later tonight Sakura-chan!&quot; She said 
while grabbing the hanger from Sakura and tossing it on the bed. 

&quot;Hoeeeee.&quot; Sakura said while sweatdropping. 

Tomoyo picked out the underwear that matched her outfit and closed the 
doors. She set their dresses on the bed and told Sakura to sit down so 
she could brush her hair and that when she was done they could switch. 
After brushing each others hair, they started getting dressed. 

When Tomoyo was pulling up her Panties, Sakura wrapped her arms around 
her waist and turned her around to kiss her. They fell to the bed and 
kissed until Tomoyo&#39;s Mom walked in. Sakura and Tomoyo looked at each 
other and giggled. 

&quot;Come on you two. If you don&#39;t hurry up we&#39;ll be late for dinner. There 
will be plenty of time to &#39;PLAY&#39; when we get home.&quot; 

Tomoyo and Sakura laughed at her choice of words and kissed once more. 
They sighed and got dressed for dinner. 

In the car, Tomoyo and Sakura couldn&#39;t keep their hands to themselves, 
so Sonomi had to seat herself between them to keep them fully clothed. 

&quot;I know you two are excited about your love, but please try to behave 
yourselves while we&#39;re here ok?&quot; 

Sakura and Tomoyo pouted: &quot;AWWWWW!&quot; 

As expected, the start of the night was indeed special. Sonomi told the 
girls stories about Sakura&#39;s Mom and Dad, and the girls told Sonomi 
about the things that they were going to do when they got home. 

&#39;SIGH&#39; &quot;This is going to be trouble.&quot; Said Sonomi. 

&quot;Heh, heh, I can&#39;t wait to see the look on your Dad and Touya&#39;s faces 
when you tell them this.&quot; She said with an evil smirk. &quot;I&#39;ve asked them 
to join us, so they should be here any minute.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll even capture it on film!&quot; Said Tomoyo while pointing her camera 
towards Sakura. 

&quot;Hoeeee.&quot; 

&quot;HEY! KAIJU!&quot; A voice bellowed from the crowd. 

Her face turned from one of joy, to one of anger, then embarassment as 
she saw her idiot brother come into view.

Sakura could do nothing more than smile. She was with the people she 
cared for more than anything in the world. Even her Dad and Yukito were 
able to make it. Dinner went off without a hitch. Well, except for Touya 
calling her a Kaiju again and Sakura kicking him under the table that 
is. Being the polite and curtious people they are, Yukito and Fujitaka 
ensisted that they pay for half of the meal, but Sonomi had beaten them 
to it by telling the waiter that she and nobody else would pick up the 
tab. 

&quot;Sonomi... didn&#39;t you say that Sakura and Tomoyo had something to tell 
us?&quot; Asked Fujitaka. 

Touya already knew what was going to be said. After all, he was the one 
that helped Sakura help herself in figuring out what to say to Tomoyo. 
He just sat back and drank his beer. He told Yukito when he got to his 
place, so Yukito sat next to Touya and shared his draft. 

Fujitaka was on the edge of his seat as his daughter built up the 
courage to tell him. As she said, Tomoyo pulled out her camera and 
started filming as Sakura spilled the beans. And Sonomi WAS enjoying 
watching his face as Sakura told him more and more. He nearly choked on 
his dinner as she told him about what they did earlier that afternoon. 

&#39;SIGH&#39; &quot;Well, I can&#39;t say that I approve of this. But if your love for 
each other is that strong... then I guess I have no choice.&quot; 

Sakura almost lept across the table and gave her Dad the biggest hug she 
could muster. 

&quot;I guess this means we won&#39;t be seeing that Gaki anymore huh Kaiju?&quot; 
Touya said. 

He could have sworn that he heard his legs snap as everyone, not just 
Sakura kicked him in the shins.

Dinner ended and everyone went their seperate ways. Fujitaka went home, 
Sakura back to Tomoyo&#39;s, and Yukito helped the now limping Touya back to 
his place for the night. 

Sonomi saw no reason to come between Tomoyo and Sakura on the ride home, 
so she sat and tried to distract herself with a newspaper while the 
girls did their thing. As soon as they got to Tomoyo&#39;s house, they ran 
for her room. Tomoyo running to her bathroom to freshen up and Sakura 
taking of her clothes to slip into the &#39;Naughty Outfit&#39; that Tomoyo had 
made for her. When Tomoyo emerged, she was thrown to the bed by the 
scantaly clad Sakura and had her clothes ripped off in 2 seconds flat. 
Sakura mounted her lover and gazed into her eyes as she planted her lips 
onto Tomoyo&#39;s petal soft ones.  

After making love to each other over and over throughout the night, 
Sakura and Tomoyo slept. Knowing that tomorrow their lives would truly 
begin.... as one.
