----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tomoyo walked into Sakura&#39;s bedroom. The old Sakura&#39;s bedroom. It was
time to make another visit and clean up that lonely place. It was
messy and dirty, but Tomoyo still could feel Sakura&#39;s smell. *She
smelled so good...* Her teddy bears were still in the same place, but
old and sad. The doll Tomoyo gave her was still on her bed, but dirty
and cold.  Happy memories...They used to be so cheerful, life was so
easy when they were ten! They could forget about feelings and their
only responsibility was school and the Clow Cards....*oh, the Clow
Cards..* Tomoyo smiled and her eyes sparkled.

Tomoyo remembered of all her fun video recording the most beautiful
girl on Earth using her innocent magic. She smiled sadly while a tear
came down on her face. *now she&#39;s gone...*.  Tomoyo couldn&#39;t help but
cry. Fujitaka-san has passed away a few years ago. Touya-san is now
living with his always beloved Yukito-san, but he won&#39;t find happiness
until he sees Sakura again. They&#39;re tired of looking for her and they
know she&#39;s doing the right thing, although Touya still hates &quot;that
brat&quot;!  *Sakura..* Tomoyo thought, still looking at the dark
depressive bedroom. Tomoyo is still the same gorgeous and lovely girl,
but her body is so beautiful and her hair is now short. She has now
the same haircut as Sakura when they were kids. All the boys look at
her and want her, but she can only think of one person...

~~~

It&#39;s been eight years. Eight years of a long research and no
results. *Syaoran-kun had promised he was coming back to Japan to stay
with me! He promised!* He&#39;d never lie to her, not like that! Never!
*Syaoran-kun, why did you leave me..?* she asked herself. The same
question, every day, every hour.

Sakura: &quot;Kero-chan, are you awake?&quot;

Kero: &quot;Ano...hmm...pudiiing...&quot; he groaned.

Sakura smiled gracefully. Kero was obviously dreaming about last
dinner&#39;s dessert. Sakura and Kero are in a little hotel room somewhere
in Japan, very far from Tomoeda. They&#39;ve been traveling around Japan
for long eight years, looking for Syaoran.

They had already told each other about their true feelings, he took
the plane to Hong Kong but never got there. The first thing Sakura did
was going look for him. Everywhere! She didn&#39;t care about her family,
about Li-kun&#39;s family, about school, nothing! She only wanted to find
her love. She hasn&#39;t called her family or friends for all these
years. It was unnecessary. They&#39;d only get more worried about her. She
was only worried about Tomoyo... Tomoyo had to say something to Sakura
before she left, but Sakura couldn&#39;t wait.

But now Sakura was tired. She can&#39;t stay looking for him forever. She
has to take care of Yue-san and Kero-chan, she misses Yukito-san so
much. She regrets of not saying goodbye to her father before he passed
away. She misses Touya, even knowing he&#39;s mad at her for running away
like this for such a long time. And she misses Tomoyo-chan so
much. The way she smiles, her smell, her secret...Tomoyo was going to
tell Sakura her deepest secret. *She said I was going to understand
everything when I&#39;d be older, but I&#39;ve always knew she really meant
something behind those kind words*.
