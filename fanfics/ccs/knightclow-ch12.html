<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 12 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Windy felt a fierce joy as she raced forward, arms
outstretched. The young woman&#39;s eyes met hers, long
reddish brown hair flowing along with the rough woolen
cloak she wore, then the ancient staff appeared and
Windy tried to flee, though she knew it was too late.
Those hateful words rang out as the girl struck, the
binding enchantment was triggered and she was sealed
away, trapped in a place that was far too limiting to
one such as her.

The mistresses changed as the years wet by but Windy
dealt with them coldly. They had her obedience, such
as it was, but never willingly. At the command of
women of so many types and styles she fought against
the beasts of the darkness, the creatures that hunted
humanity. Letting her rage free Windy ripped into
them, as she might have wished to do to her human
captors.

Windy wasn&#39;t quite sure when she became aware of the
little girl, the latest in her line. The child had
snuck the Clow Cards out from her mother&#39;s room,
playing with them out in the back yard of their house,
and she looked with wonder at the images on the cards.
Windy gazed up at that face and was oddly touched,
somehow, by the kindness that seemed to radiate from
her.

&#39;Who is she?&#39; Windy wondered.

&quot;Sakura!&quot; the child&#39;s smiling mother picked her and
the two cards up, gently scolding her little girl for
playing with the cards so openly.

&quot;The cards are lonely,&quot; Sakura explained cheerfully as
they went inside.

Windy felt a moment of pure shock, wondering at the
powerful sensitivity of the little girl. From within
her card Windy could almost feel the child&#39;s aura, the
sense of mystical power and empathy that almost seemed
to swirl around her. &#39;Could she be the next mistress?&#39;
Windy thought, feeling oddly pleased by the fleeting
idea.

Night after night they went out, she and the older
woman who was called Nadesico, battling against those
that would threaten the peace. Oddly Windy found
herself devoting more of her efforts to the fighting,
trying to protect the one whom Sakura seemed to value.
She didn&#39;t examine her motives, in truth she didn&#39;t
want to think about it. But in the end... her efforts
were in vain.

The ogre they faced was massive, towering over the two
of them, and despite her best efforts it broke free of
her grip to attack. Nadesico managed to slay the ogre
with the sword concealed in the staff, but her
injuries were too great. Windy carried her home,
carrying her on the breeze even as she faced the
horrified anger of her husband and eldest son. She
felt the depth of their grief, and even more so the
honest confusion of poor Sakura.

The next few years were quiet for Windy, remaining in
her Clow Card as Sakura went to school, graduated
university and traveled abroad. The only times she was
called forth was, surprisingly, when Sakura wanted
some company. Surrounded by strangers in a place
unfamiliar to her Sakura seemed to find comfort in
talking with Windy.

Even Windy herself was startled when one day the wind
elemental began to talk to Sakura, speaking the first
words that she had used in... many, many centuries.
Reaching out instinctively to Sakura&#39;s loneliness she
sought to give her comfort, even as her own loneliness
was soothed by the young woman&#39;s warmth and caring.

As the University faded to academic life Sakura began
to venture forth as the champion of the Clow cards and
Windy was filled with fear. The death of Nadesico
haunted her, but she gained confidence in working
beside Sakura, seeing the young woman&#39;s strength and
capability. Using just Windy and Fly they battled
against the monsters that haunted the night, even as
Windy felt her own emotions... beginning to change and
deepen.

&quot;Oh my lady,&quot; Windy murmured, her ghostly form flowing
around as she gazed down at Sakura, sleeping
peacefully in her bed. Slipping free of the Card
wasn&#39;t too difficult, at least for short periods of
time, and more and more she was drawn to do this.

Sakura had grown from child to woman before her very
eyes, and what had once been merely a protective
emotion in Windy had grown to something more powerful.
This beautiful woman was the purpose for whom Windy
existed, the one she valued and fought to protect,
even though she didn&#39;t even fully understand why.

Windy reached out with her hand, stroking Sakura&#39;s
bare cheek as she smiled fondly. &#39;Is this the feeling
Clow Reed told us of,&#39; she mused, &#39;is this love?&#39; She
didn&#39;t know, but Windy did know that whatever Sakura
asked of her she would grant, whatever Sakura needed
she would have.

Whatever the cost.

Windy dissolved, the tendrils of her form swirling to
pour into her waiting Clow Card. Softly she whispered,
&quot;Sleep well, Sakura, I will watch over you,&quot; then she
was gone.

Windy could almost feel Sakura leap up to dodge a
strike, nearly dancing in the air. From the currents
that were carried on the night air she could tell that
the thing that opposed them was big, nearly as tall as
three men, it&#39;s body bulky and almost rocky in
appearance.

Still safely sealed in her card Windy could sense
other mortals out there, observing. &#39;Sakura, be
careful,&#39; Windy thought grimly.

Distracted a moment by the new arrivals Sakura turned
in surprise, what could have been a fatal mistake. A
backhand blow from the creature sent her flying away,
hammering her right into a brick wall nearby the two
newspaper reporters, where she slid limply to the
ground.

Windy nearly exploded from the card, but she
restrained herself as she watched with fury as one of
the mortals cried out in alarm. She so wanted to join
the battle, but she also knew that the choice had to
be Sakura&#39;s. Instead she watched, simmering with
emotions.

&quot;No,&quot; the black haired woman murmured as she ran
towards where she lay. &quot;Sakura?&quot; the stranger quickly
recognized her.

&quot;Hooee?&quot; Sakura blinked up at her dazedly.

&quot;Sakura, are you all right?&quot; Yukito cried out as he
ran over.

&#39;I know him,&#39; Windy realized as she sensed the boy, a
familiar aura that had lingered in Sakura&#39;s life, &#39;he
is the one with Toya. How did he get here?&#39;

Sakura shook her head, the motion shaking Windy
lightly as the girl tried to clear away some of the
cobwebs. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she used Tomoyo&#39;s hand to pull
herself up, swaying just a bit. The creature ran at
them again and Sakura shoved the others backwards with
a cry, &quot;Get behind me!&quot;

A heavily muscled arm came down at them, cutting
through the air with a weight that nearly made Windy
wince only to be blocked by that odd, bird designed
staff. They stood there frozen for a moment, the
creature straining to crush Sakura and the others,
then the slim brown haired heaved with her shoulders
to send the monster staggering away.

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to use this,&quot; Sakura drew Windy from
beneath her cloak, &quot;but you leave me with no choice.&quot;
Windy&#39;s heart sang as she held still for a second, the
black clad figure oddly meditative, then she was
tossed up into the air.

&quot;Windy card!&quot; Sakura brought her bird designed staff
down onto the card, light flaring brightly as she
continued, &quot;Become the chain of punishment and bind my
enemy. Windy!&quot;

With an eagerness only matched by her anger Windy was
freed, soaring up in a cloud of mist and swirling air
currents. She took a moment to study the two mortals
that had dared interfere with her mistress, the black
haired woman and Yukito. She paused, giving them a
regal glance, a slight smile appearing on her face as
she gazed at Sakura. Then she turned, swooping down on
the creature and binding it with her substance,
forming bonds of solid air.

Even as Windy struck she knew Sakura was on the move.
Right behind Windy she ran at the creature, grabbing
the base of her staff and twisting it slightly. With a
steely hiss she drew forth a silvery blade, the bird&#39;s
head on the handle becoming the sword&#39;s hilt, even as
she leapt gracefully. A single downward stroke of the
weapon, a burst of black blood, and it was over.

The Windy released her ghostly bonds, flowing free of
the now dead creature. The previous guardians of Clow
had all been good warriors, but few could have won the
victory so very quickly. She frowned, seeing the blood
that splattered Sakura and swept towards her mistress.
Windy swirled about Sakura and the muck that had
splattered the cloak and black clothing was simply
gone, carried up and away by invisible hands.

Sakura smiled in gratitude and Windy felt her heart
soar once again. &#39;For you,&#39; Windy thought as she
reached out a gentle hand to stroke along the side of
Sakura&#39;s face, &#39;I would do anything.&#39; With that Windy
reluctantly returned to her card, the paper falling to
settle into Sakura&#39;s hands once more.

Resting by Sakura&#39;s heart Windy was lulled to sleep,
even as she felt the other mortals nearby. They
traveled on, going farther and farther from the
battle, as she listened to them talk. &#39;Do not harm my
lady,&#39; Windy directed her thoughts to them as she
rested, &#39;or you will answer to me.&#39;

To be continued...

Notes: More than one fan has suggested a chapter from
the point of view of a Clow Card, so I thought I&#39;d get
into the relationship between Windy and Sakura. Part
of this appeared in Chapter Two, but I hope I&#39;ve
revised the material enough to keep it interesting.</pre>
