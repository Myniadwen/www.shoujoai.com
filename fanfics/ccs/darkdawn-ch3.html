<h1>Darkest Before the Dawn (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/darkdawn-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The geomancer looked up at the young woman before calmly saying, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, but his death was not an accident.&quot;

Mei-Lin visibly stiffened. &quot;You&#39;re certain?&quot; she asked him with a 
great deal of intensity, her eyes blazing even in the shadows of the 
chamber.

The robed figure just nodded calmly before rising to slowly walk out 
of the chamber. Mei-Lin waited a few moments, then got up herself, 
leaving at a much faster pace. She strode by servants and other family 
members before she reached... her room.

Li&#39;s Mother looked at Mei-Lin sadly. &quot;You know, then?&quot; she asked her 
calmly.

Mei-Lin nodded firmly. &quot;I want permission to go to Japan, to find out 
the circumstances of his death,&quot; she said calmly.

&quot;I suspect you would go even if I refused you permission,&quot; the older 
woman said calmly. She tilted her head to the side, &quot;Are you sure you 
are ready?&quot;

Mei-Lin easily hefted a long sword that was a near perfect replica of 
the one that had once belonged to Li. Lightning crackled along it&#39;s 
blade as she answered in a cold tone of voice, &quot;I&#39;m far more than 
merely ready.&quot;



A light dusting of snow covered the ground as Sakura made her way to 
Tomoyo&#39;s apartment building. She smiled happily as a few flakes fell, 
only to melt against her cheeks. She looked up only to notice a figure 
standing by the building, and for just a moment felt afraid.

Sonomi looked up just in time to see Sakura slow, then continue onward 
to Sonomi&#39;s side. &quot;Good to see you, Sakura,&quot; Sonomi said with a smile.

&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t recognize you for a moment,&quot; Sakura said to Sonomi 
with a sad smile and a little shrug of her shoulders.

Sonomi saw how quiet Sakura still was, how hesitant, and she silently 
cursed Li Sayoran. The man had done the girl much more damage than the 
physical, he had hurt her spirit as well. &quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; Sonomi 
said to her gently.

Sakura hit the intercom keys to let Tomoyo know they were coming up, 
then she took one end of the large box that Sonomi was trying to 
carry. It was surprisingly heavy. &quot;What&#39;s in this thing?&quot; she gasped 
out breathlessly.

Sonomi laughed, &quot;All my old Christmas decorations.&quot; She said it a bit 
breathlessly, as they made their way over to the elevator, only to see 
the out of order sign posted there. She groaned loudly and shook her 
head, &quot;Tomoyo, you had better appreciate this.&quot; They huffed and puffed 
their way up the stairwell then down the hall to Tomoyo&#39;s door.

Standing in the doorway, Tomoyo said &quot;Sorry guys. Someone put an &#39;out 
of order&#39; sign on the elevator as a prank,&quot;, and then she waved around 
the official looking sign that they had seen hanging on the elevator 
doors earlier.

Sonomi and Sakura silently exchanged a long suffering look. &quot;I&#39;m gonna 
kill her,&quot; Sakura said with a sigh, adding as an aside to Sonomi 
&quot;you&#39;d better cover your eyes. It&#39;s not going to be very pretty.&quot;

Sonomi shook her head firmly. &quot;You don&#39;t get to kill her, I get first 
dibs,&quot; Sonomi said calmly, a merry twinkle in her eye.

Tomoyo looked at the two of them with a fond smile. &quot;While you two 
debate who gets to kill me,&quot; she said cheerfully, &quot;who wants eggnog?&quot;

The two women got the box inside the apartment while still cheerfully 
debating who got to kill Tomoyo first. &quot;Eggnog, please,&quot; Sakura said, 
collapsing into what had become over the last few months her favorite 
chair.

Sonomi folded her elegant frame down onto one of the couches. &quot;And one 
here, too,&quot; she cried, pretending a great deal of weariness. She 
grinned over at Sakura, &quot;Hey, I had to haul that box all the way 
here.&quot;

Tomoyo knelt down to open the top of the box and began to pull items 
out, occasionally exclaiming over an particularly sentimental item. 
&quot;Thank you for saving these,&quot; she said as her smile beamed over to 
Sonomi.

Sonomi smiled slightly, glad that she hadn&#39;t thrown they out after the 
last fight they had. &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she said softly. She tilted her 
head and asked &quot;So are you doing the artificial tree with all the 
trimmings this year?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Tomoyo said with a nod. She looked a bit nervous as she 
looked over at Sakura and Sonomi, &quot;I&#39;d like to have everybody over 
here this Christmas, if you wouldn&#39;t mind.&quot;

Sakura smiled happily, &quot;I&#39;d love to!&quot;

Sonomi looked at her daughter, wondering if she was included in the 
invitation. She was reassured by the warmth of Tomoyo&#39;s smile. &quot;Me, 
too. Would it be all right if I brought somebody?&quot; she asked 
tentatively.

Both Sakura and Tomoyo sat right up in their chairs at the last 
question, making Sonomi chuckle. &quot;Do you have a guest in mind?&quot; Tomoyo 
asked with an impish smile.

Sonomi shook her head with a sigh, &quot;Not really. But a lot can happen 
in three weeks.&quot; She said the last with a grin on her face.

Sakura smiled at Tomoyo, &quot;We got the artificial tree yesterday. Do you 
want to set it up and start decorating?&quot;

Tomoyo laughed, &quot;Why not. We&#39;ll start Christmas a bit early.&quot; She 
turned to her mother, &quot;Would you like to help?&quot;

Sonomi grinned, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; She watched Sakura and Tomoyo work 
together setting up the tree while she continued to unpack the box of 
decorations. &#39;They work well together, and they seem really happy. I 
wonder if Sakura&#39;s still living here? It might be a bit tactless to 
ask,&#39; she thought to herself, then gave a small sigh.

It wasn&#39;t until later on that evening that Sonomi finally had a chance 
to talk to Tomoyo alone. After a bit of internal debate, she had 
decided to be frank. &quot;Is Sakura still living here?&quot; she asked her a 
bit tentatively.

Tomoyo nodded, &quot;I set up the spare bedroom for her.&quot; Sonomi winced 
visibly at that, and Tomoyo smiled at her gently. &quot;It&#39;s what she&#39;s 
comfortable with,&quot; she said softly, &quot;and I&#39;m not going to press her 
into doing something she regrets.&quot;

Sonomi nodded in acceptance, before she asked Tomoyo softly, &quot;Just 
don&#39;t let her break your heart again, please?&quot;

Tomoyo smiled wryly as she said, &quot;I&#39;m a documentary filmmaker. I 
always try to keep some distance between me and my subjects.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve noticed you don&#39;t manage that too well with her,&quot; Sonomi said 
softly in reply.

Tomoyo just shrugged a bit uncomfortably. Before she could say 
anything more Sakura pushed the kitchen door open. &quot;If you could stop 
being serious for a moment,&quot; she said, noting the long faces they both 
had, &quot;I could use some help with the angel.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try to reach it,&quot; Sonomi volunteered quickly.

Tomoyo laughed softly, only sounding a little forced as she offered 
&quot;I&#39;ll go get the ladder.&quot;



Sonomi stretched out at her desk a few days later, trying to get the 
kinks of a long day&#39;s work out of her stiff, aching muscles. She was 
determined to maintain the hours of the other employees, despite her 
being company president. She found that they were more willing to work 
if they knew she was suffering, too.

&#39;Besides,&#39; she thought a bit sadly, &#39;it&#39;s not like there&#39;s anyone to 
come home to, anyway.&#39; It was the one thing she really missed. Before 
her divorce she had her no-good-husband, and even after she still had 
Tomoyo there. But after she left, the house lost much of it&#39;s life.

Sonomi looked up at the clock and decided that enough was enough. She 
packed up her desk, locked up the files, and left. She waved to the 
security guards as she left, then stood outside to ponder what to do 
for the rest of the evening.

&#39;Where was that,&#39; Sonomi pondered, remembering something she had seen 
on a on-line search. A club, not far from her office. She waved down a 
cab and with a smile gave the young man the directions. A few minutes 
later and she was sitting in a very comfortable seat in front of the 
bar at Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.

&quot;What would you like?&quot; the young woman said with a friendly smile. 
Twin crescent scars marked either side of her face, and long, 
blue-gray hair flowed down her back.

&quot;Rum and eggnog, I think. For the season.&quot; Sonomi said with a smile. 
The girl in front of her seemed to disappear, reappearing in front of 
a freezer not far down the bar. She mixed quickly and carefully, only 
to reappear in front of Sonomi with the full glass.

&quot;Sip first,&quot; she suggested with that same cheery smile. Sonomi took a 
sip, and sighed in contentment. &quot;Looks like I got it right,&quot; the 
bartender smiled.

Down the bar a woman cried, &quot;Hey, Minagi!&quot;

&quot;Sorry, gotta go,&quot; Minagi said to Sonomi, and promptly disappeared 
again.

Sonomi shook her head in wonder, turning to look across the bar. The 
dance floor was filled with young woman swaying closely together, 
enjoying the music. The dining tables weren&#39;t filled yet, but a fair 
number were taken. A red light was on above a door marked &#39;Karaoke&#39; 
and she felt some relief she couldn&#39;t hear what was going on in there. 
Her eyes widened as she saw something else, in her surprise speaking 
aloud &quot;Is that a library?&quot;

An slightly amused voice said, &quot;Yes, it is.&quot; Sonomi turned sideways to 
see a tall young woman standing beside her, her red gold hair falling 
down her back in waves. She wasn&#39;t classically beautiful, but instead 
had the feral beauty of a panther. She smiled at Sonomi, &quot;I&#39;m 
Arisugawa Juri, the owner of this loony bin.&quot;

&quot;Daidouji Sonomi,&quot; she answered reflexedly, offering her hand. The 
woman named Juri took it to shake gently.

&quot;I noticed it&#39;s your first time here,&quot; Juri said with a smile, &quot;and I 
just wanted to wish you a good time, tonight.&quot; With that she waved and 
disappeared into the crowd.

Sonomi got up, skirting the dancefloor to the dining tables. She took 
a seat, and picked up a menu off the tabletop. A few moments to read, 
and a server appeared at Sonomi&#39;s side. She looked up to order, and 
smiled at the girl&#39;s costume.

&quot;Can I take your order?&quot; the auburn hared girl in a maid&#39;s uniform 
asked her pleasantly.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Sonomi answered, looking at the girl curiously. She noticed a 
descrete nametag reading &#39;May&#39; on the front of her dress. &quot;Miss May,&quot; 
she started to say.

&quot;You don&#39;t need to say Miss,&quot; May answered her with a smile, &quot;just May 
is fine.&quot; She quickly jotted down Sonomi&#39;s order and then radioed it 
off to a kitchen before trotting off to answer another customer&#39;s 
waves.

In a surprisingly short time her meal was served, at it was delicious. 
&#39;I ought to take Sakura and Tomoyo here. It might give Sakura some 
ideas about Tomoyo, maybe,&#39; she thought to herself with a little 
smile.

A figure went by her table, only to stop and return. Sonomi looked up 
from her plate, and saw a beautiful younger woman standing by her 
table with an odd expression on her face. She thought she should 
recognize her, but she couldn&#39;t quite place her.

&quot;You&#39;re Tomoyo&#39;s mother, aren&#39;t you?&quot; she asked softly. Sonomi nodded 
to her cautiously, and the woman smiled charmingly, &quot;We met only the 
one time. I&#39;m Mitsuki Kaho, I taught your daughter and her friend 
Sakura for awhile.&quot;

Looking around them, Sonomi noticed that most of the tables were 
occupied, so she quickly took the opportunity to offer, &quot;Would you 
care to eat with me?&quot; She held her breath unconsciously, hoping that 
Kaho would accept.

Kaho smiled at her warmy, &quot;Thank you very much. I&#39;d be glad too.&quot; </pre>
