<h1>Discovering Beauty (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jbrown.html">James Brown</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/discbeaut-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>As soon as the final petal had reached the ground, the wind took up 
all of the petals and gathered them into a cluster.  The petals 
continued flowing with the breeze while remaining in the same area 
above ground.  Tomoyo stared at the pink mass with a curious look in 
her eyes, wondering what would happen next.  Suddenly, the petals 
began to inch their way toward a section of the park with trees 
surrounding the entire area.  Tomoyo quickly reacted by picking up the 
elephant and following the cheery blossom petals toward their 
destination.  The wind picked up speed and carried the petals faster, 
making the girl run in order to try and catch up.  Once the petals 
reached the trees, they escaped from Tomoyo&#39;s sight.  After Tomoyo 
reached the first row of trees, she began to walk past them wondering 
where she would find the assortment of petals.  The girl wandered 
around searching for her destination, but she had no idea where that 
was.  As she pasted more of the trees, she started to get lost in her 
search, noticing that each new tree looked exactly like the one she 
just past.  She was beginning to wonder if she would ever find the 
petals at all.  But suddenly, out of the corner of her eye, Tomoyo 
spotted them, almost missing them completely.

The petals had formed a circle around one of the trees as they began 
to orbit around it in a clockwise motion.  Tomoyo smiled again once 
she had finally found where she needed to be.  She was happy not only 
because she had found the petals, but also because she was in 
anticipation of what would happen next.  As she crept forward toward 
the tree, the circumference of the petals began to increase in size as 
they spread out away from the tree.  Tomoyo stopped in her advancement 
toward the tree as the petals broke its formation; brushing past the 
girls chest and connecting again behind her.  The girl glanced at the 
pink circle and watched its movement until it stopped a couple feet 
away from her.  When Tomoyo realized that the petals would refrain 
from moving, she turned her head towards the tree again as she awaited 
the next event to unfold.  With only a few seconds of waiting, the 
young girl&#39;s hopes would be fulfilled in a manner that she thought she 
could only imagine.  Revealing herself from behind the tree, with her 
right hand holding something behind her back and her left resting the 
Clow staff on her shoulder, Sakura gave Tomoyo a very pleasant smile. 
Tomoyo knew that Sakura would be waiting at the end of her search, but 
seeing the brown haired girl again put a vast amount of joy into her 
heart.

&quot;Sakura!&quot;  Tomoyo shouted in ecstatic jubilation as she ran toward the 
other girl and gently wrapped her arms around her neck.  Sakura placed 
her left hand on Tomoyo&#39;s back while still holding onto the staff.  
She then turned the staff back into its key form, letting the chain 
attached to it dangle in between the spaces in her fingers.  Her left 
hand was now free to give Tomoyo her soft, comforting touch.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d ever be able to see you again,&quot; Tomoyo said, her 
voice showing that she was close to breaking into tears.

&quot;I know, and I&#39;m very sorry that I did that to you,&quot; Sakura explained, 
having regret in her voice but still indicating that she was happy 
things had come around for the two.  &quot;I would never intend to hurt you 
like I did, but, well I wasn&#39;t sure if how the way you felt for 
me...and now the way I feel for you, was even possible.  But I&#39;ve 
thought about it and now I realize I was just being foolish.&quot;  Sakura 
removed her hand from Tomoyo&#39;s back and placed it on her shoulder, as 
she looked into her eyes.  &quot;It makes more sense to me than ever.  And 
now that I realize that what we share is beautiful, I want to make 
sure it lasts as long as possible.&quot;  The brown haired girl leaned in 
toward the other girl and whispered in her ear with a voice that made 
Tomoyo feel cool and with the words she had been hoping to hear.  &quot;I 
love you more than anything else in this world and I want to hold on 
to that feeling forever.&quot;  After hearing those words, Tomoyo&#39;s face 
lit up as she knew that everything would be alright, even better than 
she had hoped.  Once Sakura brought her attention back to the girl she 
loved, the two spent the time gazing at each other&#39;s beauty.  Then, 
without any warning from either of the two, as the situation presented 
them with the same idea, Sakura and Tomoyo leaned toward each other 
for a kiss.  As their lips meet, the kiss was light and tender, but 
the meaning within it was very passionate.  After the two broke off 
their physical sign of love, they smiled and continued to look into 
each others&#39; eyes, feeling content that they werte together.  Then a 
thought suddenly came to Tomoyo&#39;s mind.

&quot;Oh, I just realized.  I haven&#39;t given you your gift yet.&quot;  Tomoyo 
exclaimed, almost forgetting she was holding on to the elephant this 
whole time.  She then presented the elephant to Sakura with 
outstretched hands. &quot;I hope you still want it.&quot;

Sakura took the elephant in her left hand, examined it, and clutched 
it to her chest.  &quot;Thank you Tomoyo.  Your gift really means a lot to 
me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad that you still like it.&quot;

&quot;Do you know the reason why I really like it?&quot; the brown haired girl 
calmly asked.

&quot;It&#39;s because you said it was cute, isn&#39;t that right?&quot; Tomoyo said 
with a slight hint of confusion in her voice.

&quot;I did say that,&quot; Sakura responded as she loosened the grip on the 
plush figure and gently held it at her side, &quot;and I still think it&#39;s 
cute, but there is a different reason as to why I like it now.  I like 
it because it came from you.  The fact that you gave it to me really 
means something.  If anyone else had given it to me, it would just be 
another stuffed animal to add to my collection.  But I can tell that 
you gave this to me because you love me.  You put so much thought into 
giving this to me.  It holds all of your feelings and that&#39;s why I 
like it.  And besides, the elephant is cute, but it could never 
replace your natural beauty.&quot;

The final set of words that Sakura said connected with the dark haired 
girl effectively as she began to blush.  &quot;Th-thank you,&quot; she said.  
&quot;And thank you for understanding my intentions.  I had hoped that you 
would.&quot;

&quot;Oh, and there&#39;s something else I wanted to say,&quot; Sakura began as she 
moved her right hand from behind to reveal what she had been hiding.  
&quot;As far as putting thought and emotion into one&#39;s gift, that&#39;s what I 
had done, when I made these for you.&quot;  The gift Sakura held out to 
Tomoyo, in a slightly proud, but still cheerful manner, was a pair of 
fresh roses from the Flower Card. Tomoyuo smiled once she saw her 
gift.  She took the two pieces of floral beauty and smelled them to 
find they emitted a heavenly aroma.  &quot;They&#39;re very beautiful.  Thank 
you Sakkura.&quot;

&quot;And each of those roses both symbolize something.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;  Tomoyo asked as she looked up to Sakura.  &quot;What do they 
mean?&quot;

&quot;Hm, one represents all the feelings I have for the girl I love, and 
the other is for the hope that the two of us will always be together.&quot;

A warm feeling went through Tomoyo as she embraced the other girl 
again, and a gentle sigh escaped through her lips before she spoke.  
&quot;I would really like to see that hope realzed.&quot;  As the unnoticed 
minutes drifted by, the thoughts and desires of the two girls for each 
other went through their minds, while the comfort of the two close 
together physically acknowledged all of them.  A cool gust of wind 
went by as Sakura and Tomoyo found themselves looking into each 
other&#39;s eyes again.

&quot;Well,&quot; Sakura began as she flashed a joyful smile, &quot;I think now that 
we&#39;ve found our way into each others hearts, we should probably 
celebrate our union.  Is there anything that you want to do?&quot;

The dark haired girl gave the other girl a light kiss as well as her 
answer.  &quot;Just being here with you is fine with me.  It doesn&#39;t really 
matter what we do.&quot;

&quot;Alright then.&quot;  As Tomoyo took Sakura&#39;s arm, the two of them led each 
other toward one of the trees.  They sat next to one another at the 
base of the tree while a feeling of calmness and serenity found its 
way into both of them.  Tomoyo rest her head on her girlfriend&#39;s 
shoulder, and Sakura returned the gesture of affection by placing her 
hand on her girlfriend&#39;s head.  Nothing felt out of place as the 
cherry blossom petals were freed from their dormant position above 
ground and were carried by the wind as a sign to anyone who saw them 
that two people had fallen in love.

After another school day had come and gone, Tomoyo stood by the 
entrance waithing for Sakura to meet with her.  The two girls had 
decided to buy a snack after school and share it with each other.  To 
keep herself occupied, she took scenery shots of the school grounds 
with her camcorder.  She only got a few minutes worth of footage 
before Sakura came out and greeted her.

&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting,&quot; Sakura said a little bit embarrassed.

&quot;Oh it&#39;s no trouble at all.  I&#39;m just glad you came, and I knew you 
would be here,&quot; Tomoyo answered while recording Sakura on film.  Since 
the two were closer than ever, Sakura no longer felt shy or 
embarrassed about being in front of Tomoyo&#39;s camcorder, especially now 
that she knew why she was he dark haired girl&#39;s favorite thing to 
record.

&quot;So, do you still like the gift that I gave you?&quot; Sakura said as she 
struck a pose for the machine&#39;s lens.

Tomoyo responded with a smile as she took the camera away from her 
face to look at her girlfriend with her own eyes.  &quot;Being with you has 
always been a gift, and I will always enjoy that.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

So what did you think?  Did you like it?  Dislike it?  Or are you just 
indifferent?  Anyway, please tell me what you think.  I will take 
comments and criticism of any kind.  Just send it to me, I would 
really appreciate it.  Thanks a bunch.</pre>
