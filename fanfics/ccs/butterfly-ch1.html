<h1>Butterflies</h1>

fanfiction by <a href="../authors/erufu.html">Erufu-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>     &quot;Wait here,&quot; Sakura instructed, before turning and briskly leaving 
the room.  Meiling sighed and glanced down toward the floor from her 
current seat on her brown-haired host&#39;s bed.  She couldn&#39;t explain it, 
but she dreaded leaving tomorrow.
     It wasn&#39;t the trip that she dreaded.  Meiling had had a strange 
feeling ever since Sakura had invited her to spend the night since she 
would be leaving tomorrow.  She wanted so much to return to her home but 
at the same time, she felt torn about the situation, as she would miss 
Sakura and the others. 
     &#39;Probably Sakura more than anyone,&#39; she added in her mind, feeling 
oblivious to what made her think this way.  It felt almost like tiny 
butterflies flitting about in her stomach, and Meiling was nearly 
certain that Sakura was the cause of it.
     After all, the feelings seemed to intensify each time she saw - or 
thought about - her.
     But it wasn&#39;t the same as anything she had ever felt before.  It 
was a weird - yet somehow refreshing - feeling.  It wasn&#39;t a bad thing, 
definitely not.  Instead, it was a rather good feeling and she never, 
ever wanted to let go if she could help it.
     &quot;Meiling?&quot; Sakura&#39;s voice interrupted her thoughts as the girl 
waved her hand in front of her red-eyed guest&#39;s face.  Meiling blinked a 
few times and looked up as Sakura extended her right hand, which held a 
cup.  &quot;It&#39;s juice!  I hope you like the flavor,&quot; she said, smiling.
     Smiling back, Meiling accepted the cup from Sakura&#39;s hand as Sakura 
plopped down on the bed beside her, making the sheets rustle slightly.  
She took a sip of the orange-juice.  &quot;Why are you being so nice to me 
all of a sudden?&quot; Meiling asked after a few moments of silence causing 
Sakura to look at her.
     Sakura looked at Meiling in confusion for a couple moments but 
finally sighed.  &quot;Really, I guess I just wanted to get to know you,&quot; she 
said, rubbing the back of her neck sheepishly.  Meiling nodded, focusing 
her eyes on the drink.
     &quot;Thanks,&quot; she mumbled. Her remark caused Sakura to glance back at 
the floor for another moment or so.
     &quot;So,&quot; drawled Sakura, drawing Meiling&#39;s attention back to her.  
&quot;What do you want to talk about, Meiling-chan?&quot;
     Meiling blushed slightly and looked down at her juice again.  
&quot;Meiling-&#39;chan&#39;?&quot; she asked and Sakura&#39;s eyes widened.
     &quot;Oh!  Sorry, I won&#39;t call you that if you d--&quot;
     &quot;No.  I like it,&#148; Meiling said, smiling.  Sakura nodded, giggling a 
little.
     &quot;Um, Meiling-chan?&quot; Sakura asked, as Meiling took another sip of 
her drink.
     &quot;Yes?&quot; she responded; Sakura blushed as she glanced down. 
     &quot;Have you ever liked anyone&#133; you know, since Li?&quot; she asked.  
Meiling blinked at the unusual question.
     Fumbling to respond through her confusion, Meiling sighed and 
ignored the little voices that were screaming at her to shout &#39;YOU, 
SAKURA!&#39; since that wouldn&#39;t really have sounded anything but strange 
anyway.  And no matter how she tried to hide it, she knew she was lying 
and mentally berated herself for it.  Part of her really wanted to tell 
Sakura the truth, but the other part of her was somewhat afraid to.   
&quot;No one really that I can think of,&quot; she stated firmly and Sakura leaned 
forward, placing her elbows against her knees.
     &quot;But, I thought you still liked Li?&quot; Sakura questioned.  Meiling 
shook her head. 
     &quot;I&#39;ve thought about that a lot lately, and I&#39;ve decided to give up 
on him,&quot; she replied, causing another few seconds of silence.
     &quot;So, are you sure there isn&#39;t anyone else?&quot; Sakura continued to 
probe, causing Meiling to blush and look down at the floor.
     &quot;No,&quot; she replied.  Her answer made Sakura look at her 
suspiciously.
     &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re telling me the truth,&quot; Sakura said, noticing 
the hint of redness on Meiling&#39;s face.
     &quot;Who is it?&quot; Sakura asked again, causing the pig-tailed girl to 
bite down slightly on her bottom lip.  Seconds passed and finally 
Meiling cleared her throat.  It was now or never.
     Meiling leaned in quickly and kissed Sakura&#39;s left cheek, causing 
the girl to bolt up straight, blushing.  &quot;S-Sorry,&quot; she fumbled over her 
apology as Sakura rubbed her cheek.
     After several moments of stunned silence, Sakura relaxed back into 
a more normal sitting position.  &quot;Don&#39;t apologize,&quot; she said, smiling 
slightly.  &quot;I guess I kind of feel the same way you do.&quot;
     &quot;But, I thought...&quot; Meiling hesitated and Sakura pecked her on the 
cheek in return.
     &quot;Don&#39;t think,&quot; Sakura injected with a cheerful smile as Meiling 
smiled back.
     &quot;So...  Um, can I call you Sakura-chan?&quot; Meiling asked; Sakura 
smiled happily.
     &quot;I&#39;d like that, Meiling-chan.&quot; Sakura replied.
     Deciding not to think about the day to come, the two girls spent 
the night talking and laughing, sharing their thoughts and ideas, but 
most of all, getting to know each other.

     Sakura and the others stood around, giving their good-byes and 
wishing Meiling luck on her trip.  Sakura and Meiling smiled at each 
other and exchanged quick kisses on the cheeks, telling each other they 
would indeed meet again, and hopefully soon.
     As Meiling got on the airplane, she looked back out at Sakura who 
stared up at the plane, still smiling and waving and yelling at her, 
tears in her eyes.  Meiling smiled and waved back, mouthing a silent 
response to her, feeling those butterflies in her stomach once again.  
She and Sakura knew they would see each other again. Meiling was certain 
that as soon as she saw Sakura again, those butterflies would also 
return, as lively as ever...
