<h1>Remastered (part 2 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Within the Realm of Dreams (Edenina)

Nippon (the Japanese Dream Continent)

Tokyo (Tokyo Tower)

The sound of footfalls echoes through the darkness, with the vast
landscape of the main central &quot;hub&quot; of Edenina overhead as far as the
eyes can scan and the lights of Tokyo providing the backdrop, shadowy
figures dash across the building&#39;s rooftops in chase. One small, like a
rabbit, one a small bear with wings, and two human females.

Finally, after long minutes of pursuit, the first shadow is cornered.

Sakura, dressed in a variant of the same costume she wore when she
originally caught Jump (the card in pursuit) stands tall. &quot;At last, I&#39;ve
caught up.&quot;

BAM!! Nina reels into the metal fencing Sakura is standing on, shaking it
slightly as she falls into it but not enough to throw Sakura&#39;s balance
off. &quot;EASY FOR YOU TO SAY!!&quot; (gasp gasp) &quot;I need a time out.&quot; BASH!!
Ahead of them, Jump grows to large size and attacks, lashing out with
it&#39;s claws. Sakura easily dodges the claws, but Nina can barely scurry
out of the way before the claws rip the metal bars she was just leaning
on to shreds.

&quot;Sakura!!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m on it Kero!&quot; (draws new key out)---

------------------------------------------------------------

Flashback

Goddess Council Chamber

On the main central hub of the Edeninan landscape.

&quot;It does pose a problem--&quot; the Raven Goddess remarks, holding Sakura&#39;s
Star wand in her hand.

Sakura, with Tomoyo nearby recording the meeting, is very nervous. &quot;Can I
still use it-- Miss Goddess?&quot;

The Goddess chuckles, her voice light and cheery as she whips about (her
long hair twirling) as she walks back towards a tall cabinet near one
wall in her chambers. &quot;It might but let&#39;s give it an upgrade.&quot; As
Sakura/Tomoyo watches, the Goddess rifles through her cabinet until she
draws out a box of mystical tool. &quot;And people think the only good point
about me is my looks.&quot;

From the toolbox she draws out a hammer, a pair of pliers, and a few
pieces of crystal. As she begins to work, sparks fly and energy begins to
course through the staff, it&#39;s shape changing with each strike of the
mystical hammer, leaving both young women awestruck by the
transformation. When she is done she hands the new tool over to Sakura.
The sealing staff, now with a new bird head with a hollow point in it&#39;s
&quot;eye&quot; where Sakura&#39;s &quot;star&quot; rests, glows with power as Sakura holds it
tight.

&quot;Now it&#39;s ready for Clow card capturing---&quot; (draws etching tool out) &quot;Now
who want complimentary tattoos? I&#39;m not only a licensed magical tool
fixer, I&#39;m also an amateur tattoo artist!&quot;

Sakura sweat drops at the offer, but declines politely.

------------------------------------------------------------

Present

&quot;Key of the Star, with power burning bright, reveal the staff and shine
your light! Release!!&quot;

The key triggers, spinning and growing as it engages, it&#39;s new form and
power coming to life.

This makes Jump stop, frozen in it&#39;s tracks at the sight of the new
staff, and it&#39;s stronger power.

&quot;Sakura! The ring!&quot;

&quot;I know, Kero! I know---&quot; (holds left arm out)

------------------------------------------------------------

Flashback (Daidouji Estate)

&quot;Rings?&quot; Sakura asks, taking a ring each from Windy &amp; Umi (Water).

&quot;It&#39;s something one of the merchants in town gave us.&quot; Umi volunteers,
&quot;They&#39;re bonding rings, they store a specific power for use over and over
again. They&#39;re little trinkets that are selling pretty well over in the
malls. Sort of like magical tokens of affection.&quot; (smiles) &quot;I thought
you&#39;d like our powers at your disposal during your quest. Just like old
times.&quot;

Windy nods her head in agreeance, &quot;Gaia &amp; Light gave rings to Tomoyo, so
we&#39;re giving rings to you---&quot; (blinks) &quot;I know what Gaia&#39;s power is, but
I&#39;m not certain about Light&#39;s power.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll come in handy, thanks.&quot; (kisses each on the cheek) &quot;How
do I use them?&quot;

&quot;Just like the cards. Think about the attack and call it out, and don&#39;t
forget to point the ring where you want the attack to go.&quot;

&quot;Obviously.&quot; Umi adds, poking Sakura in the shoulder once with a smirk on
her face.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t forget that important point.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Present

&quot;WINDY!!&quot; (the wind ring charges up, kicking up gale winds as she holds
the ring out pointing it straight at Jump) &quot;SEAL JUMP WITH THE CHAIN OF
CAUTION!!&quot;

Quickly the ring spews forth long tendrils of energy, which whip and lash
about Jump, tangling it down before it can even think of escaping. Sealed
as it was, it could only wait the inevitable.

&quot;CLOW CARD, RETURN TO YOUR POWER CONFINED! JUMP CARD!!&quot;

With a hard slam of her arm, Sakura&#39;s staff releases a brilliant burst of
energy, ensnaring and ripping Jump&#39;s physical form apart, converting it
back to energy. That energy condenses, and forms it&#39;s card form again
which flies to Sakura&#39;s hand once again obedient to her touch and
command.

Nina, breath nearly gone, sits slumped near Sakura watching with drowsy
eyes.

&quot;One card--- down--- 47-- to go--&quot; (falls flat on her face) &quot;I hate my
life.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

The Next Day--- (back at the Daidouji Estate)

&quot;Sakura-chan! Wake up. Sakura-chan!&quot; Tomoyo gently shakes Sakura, until
finally Sakura rolls to one side and pokes at the alarm clock to shut it
off (which has been ringing for five minutes now).

&quot;Sigh. What&#39;s that sound.?&quot; (on the huge TV Kero is watching the vid from
last night.) &quot;You&#39;re late Sakura! Morning by the way.&quot;

&quot;G&#39;morning---&quot; (blinks) &quot;---are you watching that vid from last night?&quot;

&quot;Of course! It&#39;s been far too long since I&#39;ve been in a Tomoyo
Productions original! And I have to say I&#39;m just as good looking&#39; as I
was back in the good ole&#39; days! Yes I am!&quot; (sighs)

&quot;?&quot; (Sakura looks on the shelves of DVDs as she dresses for school, with
Tomoyo&#39;s help) &quot;I thought you finished transferring your tapes to DVD,
but some of the DVDs are missing.&quot;

&quot;Your early adventures. Mirra-chan wanted to borrow them to watch.&quot;
Tomoyo remarks, smiling as she helps Sakura get ready. &quot;Your becoming
quite a role model for her. She&#39;s becoming more and more fascinated with
your adventures, wanting to watch them over and over again, holding onto
that doll I made for you when you were 11 as she watches. She even wants
me to make copies of your adventures for her collection so she can thrill
to your exploits whenever she wants. I&#39;m going to do that today in my
studio.&quot;

&quot;---&quot; (blushing) &quot;That&#39;s--- well that&#39;s nice--&quot;

&quot;Your so modest too.&quot; Tomoyo chides, poking Sakura&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Our little
girl needs a good role model to look up to.&quot; (Suddenly Tomoyo stops what
she was doing and motions for Sakura to sit down) &quot;Which is something
else I want to talk to you about.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s about your brother, Toya.&quot;

&quot;Mirra-chan mentioned him.&quot; Sakura remembers, &quot;He helps her with her
school problems from time to time, giving her advice, being a big brother
to her and all that.&quot;

&quot;Sakura, it&#39;s more than that---&quot; (sighs) &quot;I think our little Mirra-chan
has a crush on him.&quot;

&quot;Mirra-chan?&quot; (blinks) &quot;She&#39;s too young--&quot; (sighs) &quot;--oh no--&quot;

&quot;You weren&#39;t too young to have that crush on Yuki, remember? And
remember, Mirra-chan is older than she looks though mentally she&#39;s still
a young girl.&quot;

&quot;I know! I know--&quot; (sighs as she leans her head against Tomoyo&#39;s
shoulder) &quot;I&#39;ll have a chat with Mirra-chan. But I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that
serious, she&#39;s friends with Toya and they get along well but love?&quot;

&quot;I know. It&#39;s hard to imagine our little Mirra-chan in love, but just to
make sure please talk to her about it. It&#39;s important. After all, the
first person she ever gotten close to who wasn&#39;t a Card Captor was Toya.&quot;
(smiles) &quot;Though for the life of me I don&#39;t ever remember you getting
along with Toya at that age.&quot;

&quot;Tomo-chan!&quot; (smiles) &quot;I&#39;ll remember to talk to Mirra-chan. Promise&quot;
(takes her bag and kisses Tomoyo on the lips) &quot;I won&#39;t let you down.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Sakura-chan. Now let&#39;s go. Mom made breakfast this morning.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

I&#39;m Sakura Kinomoto.

I&#39;m now getting ready to go to the next grade soon. Studying for the
tests.

I like music, PE and used to like math before it got so complex.

I&#39;m just an ordinary young woman, with a strange life and stranger love
life.

Hmm? My love life? Well it&#39;s not boring to say the least, but it&#39;s--

--it&#39;s the greatest thing that ever happened to me, and I wouldn&#39;t give
it up for anything.

I&#39;m in love with my best friend Tomoyo. She&#39;s the world to me.

And what&#39;s this hyperactive stuffed animal? That&#39;s Kerberos, Guardian of
the Seal.

He used to have this other form, but when all the Clow cards vanished so
did his power, and he&#39;s now stuck again in his tiny form. But he doesn&#39;t
seem to mind, he&#39;s grown rather fond of his form.

And I haven&#39;t told you yet about my new family---

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;G&#39;morning-- oh no--&quot;

&quot;Well THERE&#39;S our little night owl--&quot; Nina scoffs, sipping her drink as
she glances at Sakura. &quot;Not so energetic now are we. Welcome to the world
of the dreaming, Sleeping Beauty.&quot;

&quot;I DON&#39;T SLEEP THAT MUCH!&quot; Sakura grumbles, taking her seat as Tomoyo
sits down between Sakura &amp; Nina, mostly to keep the two apart. But Nina&#39;s
on a roll. &quot;Heard you coming downstairs all the way from here. Sounded
like the circus was in-house and the elephants were on parade.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;M NOT AN ELEPHANT!&quot;

&quot;Sakura---&quot; Tomoyo sweat drops, trying to settle her down.

&quot;Whoa.!&quot; (Nina puts a hand out and stops Sakura&#39;s charge, keeping her
back with one hand)

&quot;Nina, cut that out please.&quot; Eliza Destiny, Nina&#39;s partner in all things,
sighs as she watches.

------------------------------------------------------------

The taller woman with the green hair is Nina Kotobuki. She got assigned
to monitor the capture of the Clow Cards. She&#39;s a pest and a pain in the
butt, but she&#39;s also taller than me and--- arrggh!! FIVE YEARS AND I
BARELY GREW!! I&#39;M ONLY ABIT TALLER THAN I WAS AT 11!! IT&#39;S NOT FAIR!!

Why did Tomoyo and everyone else grow several inches and I only grew a
few?!? It&#39;s frustrating (I become very bitter thinking about it). I keep
wishing I was bigger, then I&#39;d show people like Nina!

The one holding Nina back is named Eliza, the girl with the long flowing
blonde hair. She seems very intelligent, and the only one Nina listens to
without question. They seem very close. Intimate even.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Leave Sakura-chan alone if you know what&#39;s good for you.&quot; Sonomi warns,
putting out breakfast with Windy&#39;s help, the two sometimes exchanging
glances and touches as they pass each other.

------------------------------------------------------------

That&#39;s Tomoyo&#39;s mom, Sonomi. She&#39;s the president of her own toy company.
She&#39;s very sweet, and has been sort of a surrogate mother to me ever
since I moved in after the disappearance of my father.

I miss him, but there&#39;s nothing I can do about it. He was exploring what
the locals call &quot;The Inner Realm&quot; (a place older than dreams itself) when
he vanished. I don&#39;t know what all that means, but it sounds mysterious
and scary. I only hope one day he returns so he can stand by me the day
I-- I mean when Tomoyo and me-- when we-- (blushes at thought) ----

She&#39;s great. I still miss my mom, but Sonomi misses her too though
recently Windy&#39;s been filling the void in her life,. Ever since Windy
became human she&#39;s been growing closer to Sonomi, and her to Windy, as if
they both experienced heartbreak in their past and can relate to each
other on a deeper level because of it. All I know is that both of them
have been very happy since pairing off together. I can&#39;t imagine a day
without the two of them laughing together, or just sitting in the parlor
enjoying each other&#39;s company. Content and happy to be with each other,
each one making the other complete. Sort of like me &amp; Tomoyo, and how we
each make the other complete in our own ways. But I&#39;m never lonely. I
have everyone here and we&#39;re all family. I have Tomoyo, Sonomi, Windy,
Water (Umi), Woods (Gaia), Light, Dark, Little Mirra-chan, Fuu and of
course little Kero.

&quot;Why am I last?!? Don&#39;t I rate over at least Dark or Light?!? Don&#39;t I get
some seniority?!? And why am I ALWAYS little Kero! You saw my original
form, you know what a stud I am! Right? Right?!? Somebody needs to
rewatch her &quot;early adventures&quot; because somebody forgot the importance of
me and--&quot;

Sigh.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Thanks. I better get to work. Come on, &#39;liza, let&#39;s roll.&quot;

&quot;YOU CAN&#39;T BE LEAVING ALREADY!&quot; (looks at Tomoyo who&#39;s already on her way
out) &quot;Come on slowpoke, we have to get to school.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re still setting up the portable command--&quot; Eliza starts, only to
quickly jump aside as Mirra-chan rushes past them and starts eating
quickly, joined in by Sakura who also wolfs down her food.

&quot;Like &#39;father&#39;, like daughter.&quot; Tomoyo remarks, sweat dropping as she
watches the two eat.

&quot;Shanks fer da food---&quot; Mirra-chan mutters, Sakura right behind her with
the same expression (eyes spinning, hand pounding chest, tears flowing,
dazed look) grabbing their gear and heading out.

&quot;Uh-- you OK, Sakura? Mirra-chan?&quot;

Both girls nod their heads, quickly jamming their roller-blading gear on
and rushing out the door.

&quot;Bye girls! Have a good day!&quot;

&quot;Goodbye! See you later!&quot; Mirra-chan calls out.

&quot;Sigh.&quot; (Kero watching the two leave from Sakura/Tomoyo&#39;s bedroom)

&quot;Somethings never change.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Wait for us! Wait!!&quot; Sakura calls out, finally catching up to Nina/Eliza
(on bikes) and Tomoyo (casually gliding along on a custom set of roller
blades that she brought herself after spending a year having Sakura teach
her how to roller blade). &quot;I&#39;m sorry but you know today&#39;s a test we have
to take.&quot;

&quot;I know! I know-- sigh-- I wish studying for the next grade was as easy
as capturing Clow cards!&quot;

Suddenly Mirra-chan becomes very cheery all of a sudden, waving her arm
as she sees someone. &quot;TOYA-CHAN!!&quot;

&quot;---Toya-chan?!?&quot; Sakura sighs, shoulders slumping.

&quot;Hey there, little sprite.&quot; (rubs Mirra-chan&#39;s head as she passes near
his bike) &quot;Been doing your studies and working out like you promised?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

&quot;Hey, Toya--&quot; Sakura mumbles as she passes him.

&quot;Hey, squirt! How&#39;s life? Still oversleeping?&quot;

&quot;---back off---&quot; she mutters as she paces ahead of him, grumbling.

Toya rides near Mirra-chan, smiling as he talks to her. &quot;Have to watch
out about the things you copy from her. Don&#39;t want to wake up late, and
have to wolf your breakfast down like she always---!!!&quot;

(Sakura drops back, just enough to pass him by and nail Toya in the leg
as she does.)

&quot;---somebody&#39;s temper hasn&#39;t improved either, I see--&quot; Toya mutters.

------------------------------------------------------------

Toya, my brother. (Why he couldn&#39;t have fallen off the face of reality is
still beyond me.)

I can&#39;t believe little Mirra-chan could possibly have a crush on him!
She&#39;s too good for him.

And he&#39;s already spoken for, which is another person I can&#39;t believe has
any interest in HIM!

What&#39;s with that anyway?!?

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;---and she oversleeps! Sure she&#39;s got more stamina than me, but she
sleeps like the dead!&quot;

Nina, once again, was making rude comments, this time as she talks to
Toya.

&quot;I DON&#39;T SLEEP LIKE THE DEAD!&quot;

Toya - &quot;She sleeps like a monster actually.&quot;

Nina - &quot;Noticed she stomps like one too.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;HEY!! I&#39;M RIGHT HERE!!&quot;

Mirra-chan looks on confused at their banter.

&quot;They really like each other, you know.&quot; Tomoyo assures her as she nears
Mirra-chan. &quot;They just have a really funny way of showing it sometimes.&quot;

&quot;Oh--&quot; (looks at the three arguing) &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever understand
everything about being human, Tomoyo-mama--- it&#39;s confusing at times.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s confusing for me too sometimes, Mirra-chan. You just have to take
it one day at a time.&quot;

Eliza - &quot;--I&#39;m sure she must be worried about what&#39;s happening lately.&quot;

Toya - &quot;An empty mind usually has no worries.&quot;

Nina - &quot;Amen to that!&quot;

Tomoyo (sweat drops) - &quot;I better break them up before Sakura-papa hurts
someone. I&#39;ll see you later, Mirra-chan!&quot; Tomoyo takes Sakura&#39;s arm as
the group heads for the high school dropping Mirra-chan off at Sakura&#39;s
old school. Toya suddenly turns back and tosses something to Mirra-chan.
&quot;Here! I got you a new pencil case! Great job on that test last week!&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Toya-chan!&quot; (Hugs case and smiles, only for a dark haired
girl to walk up and surprise her by remarking about the case. The two
talk and walk of together.)

&quot;Now isn&#39;t that a familiar scene---&quot; Tomoyo remarks as she watches the
girl walk to class with Mirra-chan. &quot;That must be her best friend,
Hikaru. She mentioned her to me a few times.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s pretty.&quot; Sakura sighs, turning back to focus on her blading.
&quot;She&#39;s Mirra-chan&#39;s best friend, right? We have to ask her to invite
Hikaru over to the house someday, maybe for a slumber party.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;d seem like we&#39;re spying on them. And she might think we&#39;re
meddling with her friendships if we look too nosy at the start. But the
slumber party idea might be a good idea. Maybe we should let her ask us
and then go along with it. Make it her idea instead of ours.&quot;

&quot;Sure that&#39;ll work?&quot;

&quot;Worked with you--&quot; (smiles as Sakura looks at her) &quot;--just kidding.&quot;

&quot;----&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Beneath Northwest High

Command Center 1 (originally an old automated Judgment Monitoring
station)

It took a few days work to rip out the automated antiques and put in new
model equipment (with the ability to go either auto or manual operation).
The delay was, of course, also lengthened by the need to sneak everything
in and out, and not to attract attention to the job or arouse suspicions
of students.

So one day would be spent removing old equipment, then the next day would
be spent putting the new equipment (swapped with the old during the
night) into place. By now the center was almost complete with only the
huge mainframe to put in and the rest of the stuff like the conference
room set, the coffee maker, and a few vending machines as well as a
working kitchenette which was only half completed.

&quot;I think I&#39;ve seen more wiring then I was ever meant to see in one week&#39;s
time---&quot; Nina sighs, making the last connections to bring another bank of
systems online. &quot;90% of the inner command center is now up and running,
but without the mainframe core it&#39;s 100 million yen worth of worthless
systems.&quot;

&quot;100.75 million yen to be exact.&quot; Eliza notes, putting her last
connections in as well. &quot;Now we can make that 92% of the command center
is now up and running.&quot;

&quot;But again, without the core it&#39;s worthless. Sure we can cruise the net,
play solitaire or something of a more &quot;adult&quot; nature, but we can&#39;t do
much real work down here--&quot; (blinks as she looks around) &quot;Though if I
ever go crazy and my brain melts I can always turn this into a porn den
and make millions preying on the overwrought male hormones above us.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s not go too far with the promise that your calling all the shots
that Command gave you.&quot;

&quot;Well your no fun--&quot; Nina flops back into the Command chair in the center
of the room and spins it around a few times, watching Eliza take a
position near her to one side. &quot;My first command and it&#39;s playing second
fiddle to Snoozer the Ham-Ham Card Captor.&quot; (huffs her breath) &quot;Man did
Command screw me over or what!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think Sakura&#39;s going to like being compared to a hamster in a
children&#39;s Anime---&quot; (blinks) &quot;Snoozer?&quot;

&quot;The weird one that sleeps all the time, uses a sock for a bed.&quot; (sighs)
&quot;Alright so she&#39;s not THAT bad, but still she could wake up earlier in
the morning. Hmph. Even with all her flaws Command sees her as perfect,
and I only have a few shortcomings and I&#39;m screw-up material. What a
discouraging thing that is.&quot;

&quot;So, Nina--- How did she become mistress of the cards anyway?&quot;

&quot;Total accident. She pries open the Clow book, sets the cards free, and
Snoozer Jr (Kero) has to con her into capturing them again because he
can&#39;t do it himself. Apparently his powers go bye-bye when the cards
scatter to the four winds. Case in point since he&#39;s lost his powers twice
already, and the second time wasn&#39;t even Sakura&#39;s fault!&quot;

&quot;Are they alive?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but obviously not in a way we term &quot;alive&quot; because the six cards
that did become human seem to be still settling into being &quot;living&quot; as it
were. Don&#39;t know how it was when they were cards, but I guess they had
some form of &quot;half-life&quot; as it were.&quot; (thinks for a second) &quot;Must be the
more the card is used the more mature it becomes.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;Must be. Look at Windy/Mirror. Windy is a card that gets used a great
deal, so when it became human it took on a mature and older stance. Even
looks at Umi/Gaia like they&#39;re her little sisters. Meanwhile we have
Mirror, who isn&#39;t used as much, and has the developmental skills of a
young girl the minute she becomes human with all the quirks and failings
of youthful emotional development. That, in a nutshell dear Eliza, is my
theory. The more the card is used, the more it&#39;s exposed to &quot;living&quot;, and
the more it matures. Cards used less don&#39;t mature as fast, and are thus
emotionally younger than cards used more and thus more experienced and
skilled. Sorta like AD&amp;D logic for the emotional part of the Clow Card
brain.&quot;

&quot;---if you say so---&quot; Eliza whispers, still absorbing information as she
speaks.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I still think Kero tricked me.&quot; Sakura laments.

&quot;Be nice. Most people couldn&#39;t do what you do--- the little sandwiches
are great, thanks.&quot; (kisses Sakura on the cheek as they eat lunch,
specially made by Sakura for Tomoyo). &quot;You&#39;re a Cardcaptor, who saves the
world from Clow Cards not once, but TWICE! Isn&#39;t that cool?&quot;

&quot;---Tomoyo-chan---&quot; (sweat drops)

------------------------------------------------------------

I&#39;ve been with Tomoyo-chan ever since third grade.

I could never imagine my world without her in it.

I suppose that lead to falling in love, when I thought she would leave me
forever--

--and I finally realized friendship sometimes can become love.

She&#39;s smart, and beautiful, and the light of my world.

Though sometimes she gets a little too excited about this Cardcaptor-ing
thing.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;And don&#39;t forget to let me tape you next time!&quot; (camera already rolling,
focused right on Sakura)

Sakura faints.

&quot;And I got a new costume ready for you too! I designed it already!&quot;

Sakura sighs as she takes another bite of her food, from a flattened
position, eyes narrowed and sweat dropping as she does. &quot;---sigh---&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Tomoyo makes my clothes for Cardcaptor-ing. She did it before, and
she&#39;s doing it again.

It was very embarrassing when she first did it---

---(Somethings never change, but don&#39;t tell Tomo-chan I said that!)---

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Sakura! When you do your duty, you have to wear special clothes that set
you apart! And you have to videotape it too! You know how much Mirra-chan
looks up to you, and she already put an order in for your new adventures
(DVD Series II Volume 1) so I want to get it to her ASAP!!&quot; (smiles as
she eats)

------------------------------------------------------------

Tomoyo-chan. She&#39;s my light, my star, my love---

---she&#39;s also a bit strange. But I didn&#39;t say that either--

But back to reality, as it were.

What do they teach here? Strangely it&#39;s the same stuff I learned in
Junior High, only harder---

---with more facts, and harder dates to learn, and harder math, and worst
homework--

---wish High School was just Junior High for older people. At least
somethings never change--

PE for example.

------------------------------------------------------------

Sakura makes the jump over the horse just fine, no stress for her.

&quot;Great job! Maybe next time we&#39;ll use a real horse!&quot; Mr. Terada chides
her.

It&#39;s been a few years since he taught them in Junior High, but now he
worked in the High School, and was engaged to marry. But for the life of
her Sakura couldn&#39;t figure out who despite the fact everyone else seemed
to know, and was keeping it from her. Every time she ask about it people
would clam up and not talk. Once she even thought he was going to marry
Tomoyo, but that was one day before her 16th birthday and the next day
her suspicions vanished with her last doubts about her love when the two
consummated on the night of her 16th birthday and swore their love
everlasting.

Still, nobody wanted to talk about Mr. Terada&#39;s fiancee, though somebody
knew who it was.

Toya was working the soccer team as their coach, which he did sometimes
as a favor to his old school. But just having him that close to her made
Sakura pouty.

&quot;Why the hell does he have to coach today? Is the soccer coach sick again
or something?&quot;

&quot;That Neko flu bug gets around it seems.&quot; Tomoyo off-handedly comments,
watching the soccer team practice as the rest of their class does the
vault. Suddenly something catches her eye, off to one side she can see
Mirra-chan and Hikaru watching the soccer team practice while waiting for
their class to do vaults over at the Junior High side. Mirra-chan was
shaking the fence fiercely, looking agitated.

&quot;Now doesn&#39;t that bring back a memory!&quot; Tomoyo slyly remarks.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t that bad--&quot; (sighs) &quot;--maybe I was. But she&#39;s too good for
him.&quot;

&quot;Then you&#39;ll talk to her?&quot;

Sakura smiles as she gives Tomoyo a cunning glance, &quot;Maybe you&#39;ll like
her to fall for Hikaru?&quot;

&quot;---Sakura---&quot; Tomoyo blushes, but her intent is clear. &quot;--maybe, but
that&#39;s her choice, not ours.&quot;

&quot;Oh Tomo-chan, I--&quot;

Suddenly Sakura freezes.

&quot;Sakura, what---&quot;

&quot;GET DOWN!!&quot;

As she quickly shoves Tomoyo down, a huge fighter comes barreling out of
nowhere, barely managing to get over the school fields and back into the
sky.

&quot;What was that?!&quot; Tomoyo gasps, looking quickly to make sure Mirra-chan
was safe.

Mirra-chan was clinging onto Hikaru, keeping her safe.

&quot;That was an Omegatech I think. Saw it in a movie once---&quot; (looks off to
one side) &quot;--what the--&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;&lt;MAIN SYSTEMS RE-ENGAGED. SECONDARY SYSTEMS INOPERABLE.&gt;&quot;

&quot;&lt;WARNING! MAIN DRIVE SYSTEM DAMAGED! MANEUVERABILITY DOWN 40%!&gt;&quot;

&quot;Your telling me---&quot; Captain Lazarus glumly remarks, checking the wing
struts as he turns his fighter about. The wings were scratched and dented
from flying debris, the main fuselage was solid but dented, and the
cockpit&#39;s hard plasti-steel glass was cracked in several places. &quot;One
good gust and that thing almost impaled me through Tokyo Tower.&quot; Jack
laments into his voice recorder, hoping it survived the fight to keep
what might be his last recorded thoughts. &quot;Almost crashed and burned into
that school too--&quot; (looks down) &quot;They&#39;re OK though. And wouldn&#39;t that be
a hard one to explain to people--&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the---&quot; The commlink buzzed and crackled, signal isn&#39;t holding
solid with all the energy being discharged into the air from Fly&#39;s
presence &quot;--is it dow-- repor-- tus of Fly-- is any-- there? Res--&quot;

&quot;Fly is still up. Repeat, Fly is still up and active. It took off again
but---&quot; (takes a look as his fighter flies over the town) &quot;---it&#39;s
getting more powerful.&quot;

From his viewpoint overlooking Tokyo proper, he could see the Frigate
Antares, listing in an awkward sideways angle, sticking out of Tokyo
Harbor. The ship forced down by Fly, it&#39;s strength growing in leaps and
bounds past even it&#39;s old power levels. A few days ago it was manageable.
Now it was becoming impossible to deal with.

It didn&#39;t damage the ship, only knocked it askew (and it&#39;s anti-grav
drives did the rest to twist the huge behemoth into the harbor).

&quot;What&#39;s going on up there?&quot;

This time the signal was coming through, mostly because it was coming
from a nearby source.

&quot;Nina? Is that you? Where are you?&quot;

&quot;Northwest High, the school you almost plowed into!&quot;

&quot;Sorry about that, Fly knocked me for a loop.&quot;

&quot;Fly&#39;s here?!?&quot;

&quot;Yes it is--- don&#39;t you have your systems up yet?&quot;

&quot;Not without a mainframe, the stuff down here is super sized paperweights
without it. What&#39;s the situation?&quot;

Jack looks around at the chaos Fly left in it&#39;s wake. &quot;Fly took off
again, so it looks like the worst is over for now---&quot;

&quot;Guess again---&quot;

&quot;Wh--?&quot;

Nina voice sounded nearly silent, a faint whisper as she spoke, &quot;Look
up---&quot;

As he looks upwards his breath sticks, and his eyes widen.

Fly was coming back, barreling down from the sky-- and right at the two
schools Jack barely managed to avoid colliding into a few minutes ago.

Jack - &quot;---aw damn---&quot;
