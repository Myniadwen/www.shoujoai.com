<h1>Side by Side</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rubymoon.html">Ruby Moon</a><br> </h2>
<pre>((A/N: *sigh* don&#39;t ask me why oh why I chose a corny title as such. Please no flames, 
this is my first serious yuri and I rushed through it a bit. Simply because I wanted to finish 
it before karate class! Hoeee! PLEASE REVIEW! arigato!))

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things just don&#146;t work out.

Not things &#145;like that&#146;.

I was different. You aren&#146;t &#145;that kind&#146; of girl.

Not at all. You are happy, perky, innocent, carefree.

Almost totally normal except for that one little factor: You are a card captor.

A card captor.

We were, are two sides of the same coin.

I&#146;m artistic, quiet, calm.

You&#146;re athletic, joyous, easily excited.

I&#146;m normal.

You&#146;re magical.

You were always WERE magical. Even before kero-chan and the clow cards, you always 
cast some sort of horribly sweet spell over me just by walking beside me.

And I know my eyes would reflect all the love I held for you...but you, you would never 
notice.

What do I expected you to do? It&#146;s not normal. Not normal at all. Simply put: I am 
abnormal. And, in other&#146;s eyes, possibly disgusting.

Is it disgusting to love and care for you so much that I would give my very life and soul for 
you? Is it THAT much of a sin!?

I don&#146;t know....I just don&#146;t KNOW!

But every time...every time I&#146;m around you, I just get that FEELING. That fluttering in my 
stomach...that hot feeling in my cheeks as a red color floods my face. Yup. That&#146;s how it 
was.

Sick and unusual punishment.

You wouldn&#146;t know how it would be, Sakura. You&#146;re innocent. You&#146;ve got magic, a 
whole life ahead of you. You&#146;re not on the outside looking in at something...someONE 
you can&#146;t have. Heck, you could have any guy you wished, because you&#146;re so pretty. So 
very beautiful, inside and out and anyone would be a fool to pass up a chance to be your 
&#145;one and only.&#146;

and me, of course I wouldn&#146;t have a chance. You care for me, yes...but not like THAT. 
You&#146;re too, too...oh, what&#146;s the word!? Innocent, I guess. Too innocent to care for me like 
I care for you. You wouldn&#146;t understand.

So I can&#146;t tell you, my love. I can&#146;t tell you and probably, will never tell you. I&#146;ll just keep 
growing closer to you as your camera-crazy best friend and we&#146;ll grow up and we&#146;ll go to 
the mall and I&#146;ll make you cute dresses and videotape you and we&#146;ll laugh at funny movies 
and cry at sad ones and gripe about boys and you&#146;ll become the card mistress and all that 
time, all that time...you&#146;ll never know.

You&#146;ll never know that I love you. You just won&#146;t ever, ever know. Because I&#146;m too 
chicken...and I know, if I tell you, that would mean losing you, forever.

So, you see...I sit here in the park, and the breeze plays with my hair. I have sobbed myself 
into a mess of silvery hair and puffy eyelids. And I still, even in the setting dark, can&#146;t 
forget about you.

Even in the middle of the park and the shadow of night is looming ahead, cold and 
unforgiving, I can&#146;t forget about you.

I can&#146;t forget about you and you&#146;re bright smile and copper-woven hair and your emerald 
green eyes that I adore so much. Those eyes that I know I will never be able to stare into 
with all the love in my heart reflecting in my eyes. Never.

And it hurts.

It hurts so much. I just want some form of refuge...I just want to hide, and for a day...oh, 
just for one short, short day I want to not feel anything. And maybe, just maybe I&#146;ll be 
able to survive this constant barrage of torture as day-after-day...I see you.

And I see those stupid boys gawking at your beauty as if you&#146;re some, some THING and 
I&#146;m outraged...but sad. I don&#146;t want to &#145;gawk&#146; at you, that&#146;s downright disrespectful and 
truly disgusting. But I can&#146;t help to stare, wide-eyed at your amazing soul and spirit and 
beauty that I know I will never have.

I guess that&#146;s some subtle form of gawking, but I can&#146;t help myself. I just can&#146;t.

I can&#146;t help but admire you.

I can&#146;t help but adore you.

I can&#146;t help but be in love with you.

I can&#146;t help but love you.

Simple as that. I love you, Sakura Kinamoto, but you, you don&#146;t love me back and never 
will.

And.

Never.

Will.

That&#146;s the truth. The very very truth.
Nothing compares to you: no one compares to you.

My &#145;wealth&#146;? My &#145;artistic skills&#146;? They mean nothing. I would gladly throw them away in 
a heartbeat if I could just hear that you love me back.

But I know that would never happen. NEVER....so I seek refuge in those things hoping 
that maybe I can forget about you.

How can one forget an angel of amazing beauty and even more amazing spirit?

No one. It&#146;s impossible: so my refuge always crumbles around me.

Recently it&#146;s getting harder and harder to accept the fact that I love you and you don&#146;t love 
me. I can barely keep myself from breaking down into sobs whenever I&#146;m around you.

And, being your ever-lovely and kind self, you notice.

And it breaks my heart even more.

&quot;Tomoyo?&quot;

I freeze. My tears turn to ice.

The voice of an angel. A sad, sad angel. I slowly look up...and the face of an angel hovers 
over me. You takes a seat beside me on the cold park bench.

You always have to be so damn caring and sweet. And, my heart shatters into a few more 
pieces amongst the hundreds it&#146;s already shattered into.

&quot;Tomoyo, what&#146;s wrong?&quot;

My tongue feels like lead. Dead weight, and I cannot speak.

And you wait, ever-vigilant, ever patient.

&quot;Nothing.&quot;

Again, my feelings are slammed behind a door: and I lock myself up once again.

You gently, lovingly wipe away my tears. I wonder what wonderful thing I have done to 
deserve your presence in my life.

&quot;No one cries for no reason, Tomoyo-chan. Tell me, what&#146;s wrong?&quot;

Again, I can&#146;t speak. TOMOYO-CHAN! You called me...wait, you call everyone with a 
&#145;chan&#146; at the end. It&#146;s part of your lovely, loving nature. I look down at the pavement.

I can&#146;t hide.

I can&#146;t. I can&#146;t anymore. I&#146;m slowly dwindling away and if I hide much longer...I&#146;m going 
to explode.

But I still hide.

damn it if I explode. I&#146;d rather explode then loose you. Stupid, isn&#146;t it? But, still...

You sit back and start fidgeting with your skirt hem. You sigh and look at me, and your 
eyes are worried.

&quot;Tomoyo, you&#146;ve been distant, and quiet. If something&#146;s bothering you I want to know.&quot; 
You choke back a sob. I look at you, startled. &quot;I miss my Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

Then you fling yourself at me, and hold me close. You cry, and I feel your tears on my 
own cheek, and they burn like fire. But I can&#146;t pull away, because I want to be here for 
you.

&quot;Sakura...Sakura-chan.&quot; I whisper, trying to find the words.

You sit back and wipes at your face. &quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;Please don&#146;t be mad at me.&quot; I plead. &quot;Gomen, I have a confession to make.&quot;

I can&#146;t sit back and see you like this. God, how could I have been so selfish? I was 
thinking about me all this time, without a second thought. You may not love me like I love 
you, but you care for me: I&#146;m your best friend, and I&#146;m proud to wear that title...and best 
friends tell each other everything.

&quot;Go on.&quot; You say, wiping your tears on your shirt. I slowly reach out my hand and put it 
over yours.

&quot;Sakura...for the longest time...&quot; I sigh and take a deep breath. I feel a knot in my 
throat...but force myself to speak through it. &quot;For the longest time...I...I love you.&quot;

There.

I said it.

Those life-changing words that will forever and always determine our fate.

I flinch involuntarily as you sit, stock-still, the cold wind sweeping your hair to the side, 
your eyes shining in the dull moonlight.

Suddenly you fling yourself at me and hold me tight. At first I&#39;m shocked and struggle 
away. &quot;iie! Sakura! You misunderstand!&quot; I yell. You must have misunderstood. You&#146;re not 
&#145;like that&#146;.

You sit up and wipe tears away from your eyes. This time, happy tears. &quot;Gomen! I don&#146;t, 
Tomoyo-chan! I don&#146;t!&quot; You say, grinning and crying at the same time.

Suddenly, the impossible has happened.

I was hiding all this time...and...and...you love me. You love me back!

I&#146;ve been denying what&#146;s in my heart.

And I&#146;ve been denying what&#146;s in your heart.

And I&#39;ve been denying everything when perfect happiness for both of us was right in front 
of me!

And destiny is here, and I know. I know we love each other, no matter what.

So, once again, you and I hug each other. Finally, united in a chain of love forever.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here we are, in a calm spell of mutual silence. You and I, forever. No matter what. 
We&#146;ll love each other: forever.

The hours have gone by and still, here we are. It grows colder, but we share a jacket. We 
share each other&#146;s warmth. 

We share the flame of love, and it will never go out.

Suddenly, you lean away from me. You look sadly into my eyes.

I immediately think you&#146;re going back.

But you aren&#146;t.

&quot;Tomoyo...I meant every word I said...but...&quot;

You trail off...then choke a bit, and continue. &quot;But...I&#146;m not ready...for this.&quot;

You plead with your eyes. You plead with me...to understand.

And yes, I do understand.

&quot;It&#146;s OK, Sakura-chan. I will always love you, and I will always be here for you, as your 
best friend.&quot; I say, smiling through my tears.

Tears of joy.

You have tears of joy in your eyes, too. Precious diamonds that I would never, ever trade 
for anything else.

&quot;Thank you, Tomoyo.&quot;

A gentle, feather-light kiss on my cheek. A moment I&#146;ll never forget.

And we walked home, side-by-side...

side-by-side in understanding.

in life.

in destiny.

in love.

We were home, side-by-side in love.
