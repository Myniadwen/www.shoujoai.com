<pre>More angsty Tomoyo-related musings for you.... yeah, it&#39;s not gonna get 
happy for our poor little video-girl anytime soon I&#39;m afraid... ;_; 
though I do have a seed of an idea for a fic that, while not a happily-
ever-after per se, isn&#39;t as severe as these first two have been. If 
you&#39;re wondering, &quot;Shoutan&quot; is a great little Japanese word that means 
both &quot;focus&quot; and &quot;crying in pain&quot;..... couldn&#39;t really find a more 
appropriate title for a Tomoyo story, could you? =(  

Stuff in *asterisks* = thoughts.  

------------------------------------------------------------

       &quot;Sakura-chan..... I..... I-I love you........&quot;

       Tomoyo felt a shuddering sigh of relief course through her body 
at finally speaking the words she had longed to say ever since she 
realised how she felt about Sakura.... *and when was that anyway?* It 
was so hard for her to remember a time when she had not felt this way. 
And now the truth was spoken at last - though the relief she felt at 
doing so did nothing to quell the erratic pounding of her heart at the 
anticipation of the Cardmistress&#39; response. Though she had never 
expected her feelings returned in equal amount, she could at least hope 
that Sakura would respect the courage it had taken to reveal her most 
secret longing, that she could in some way, shape or form 
understand.......

       In the split-second it had taken this emotional torrent to flood 
through Tomoyo, she had been entirely unaware that Sakura&#39;s eyes had 
widened by what appeared to be several whole inches, and as her world 
came back into focus she was completely unprepared for the expression 
of utter shock that her friend now wore.

       &quot;N-nani...?&quot; Even Sakura&#39;s softest voice was enough to slice 
cleanly through Tomoyo&#39;s thoughts in a heartbeat, and this was far from 
Sakura&#39;s softest voice. It was more of a tone that would make a 
rampaging Clow Card think twice about what it was taking on. 
&quot;Tomoyo.... you....&quot; The look in her eyes suddenly shifted from 
bewilderment to hardness. A look that Tomoyo had never seen Sakura wear 
before, not even in her fiercest of battles. &quot;How could you think like 
that about me?!&quot;

       Tomoyo&#39;s mind spun. She had lain awake so many nights playing 
out all of Sakura&#39;s possible reactions over and over until it hurt to 
think. She thought she had prepared herself for everything, even the 
worst. But when it came to the actuality of it, deep down she had hoped 
beyond hope that Sakura could understand, burying the worst-case 
scenario within the shadowed recesses of her mind.... because it hurt 
too much to face the fact that she couldn&#39;t exist without Sakura. No, 
that wasn&#39;t true...... she *didn&#39;t* exist without Sakura. The auburn-
haired girl was her life, her only friend.... her only love. She was 
the only one who had ever had time for the shy, eccentric little rich 
girl. Everyone else thought that Tomoyo had everything. It was so far 
from the truth. Tomoyo had nothing.... nothing that mattered, anyway. 
Sakura..... Sakura was all that mattered, and now she was slipping 
away, her worst nightmare made truth. She took a step closer towards 
her friend despite the Cardmistress&#39; anger, hoping to console her, to 
put things right....

       &quot;Sakura-cha--&quot;

       The word hadn&#39;t even left her mouth before it was punctuated by 
a stinging slap across her left cheek, sending her sprawling to the 
ground, her head ringing. Through the thick haze of emotion that 
clouded her mind she could hear a voice cry, sharp yet strangely 
distant.

       &quot;Don&#39;t ever call me that again!!&quot;

       She could sense emotion welling up behind Sakura&#39;s voice, but it 
compared little to the feeling of raw despair that had torn into her 
heart as surely as the auburn-haired girl&#39;s fingernails had torn into 
her pale flesh, her pallor now turned almost sickeningly white at the 
horrible wrenching feeling in her gut that far outstripped the pain of 
Sakura&#39;s physical rebuke. Hot sanguine trickled down her cheek, crimson 
tears in place of the ones that welled in her eyes but stubbornly 
refused to fall, denying her even the small comfort that release would 
bring. Something inside her wanted to scream, but the sound died long 
before it ever found her throat, choked to death by the numbness that 
was strangling her senses and consuming her rational thought. 
Everything that was vital to her, every tiny seed of happiness that had 
ever taken root in her heart, had been torn from deep within her, 
leaving a cold, dead emptiness in its place as she watched everything 
she had ever known shatter beneath the gaze of the one she loved. Not 
even the memories that she had so painstakingly captured and filed away 
could stand against the harsh reality she saw before her. Though her 
blurry vision was no longer capable of discerning Sakura&#39;s gaze, the 
mental image was burnt into her thoughts, its haunting trace searing 
into every recollection she could conjure of their past together. It 
didn&#39;t matter how Sakura had felt back then. She hated her now. *And I 
deserve it.... I deserve to be hated..... I deserve to be alone...... 
because I........ because I...........* She stopped, sifting through 
the broken, piercing shards of her thoughts for some kind of answer, 
some reason, some justification for her punishment, almost crying out 
with frustration as she found nothing. *Why? What did I do anyway? Why 
are these feelings so wrong that they deserve your hatred?* Cracking 
under her own emotional exhaustion, her small body convulsed 
uncontrollably as the tears she sought finally fell, her eyes 
struggling to fixate on the rippling green pools that were Sakura&#39;s. 
*Please tell me why...... Sakura-chan....... please tell me.........*

       &quot;..........please.........&quot;

       The final word escaped, half-choked, from lips stained with 
blood that Tomoyo had lost the capacity to taste. For the first time 
since the dark-haired girl had spoken her confession, Sakura looked at 
her, really looked at her. Though the scrape on her cheek had only been 
a flesh wound, it had cut so deeply into Tomoyo that she looked as 
though the blows to her psyche had been physical. The blood starkly red 
against her alabaster skin, the crumpled little thing in front of her 
that had once been Daidouji Tomoyo looked like nothing so much as a 
discarded doll, a child&#39;s plaything left face-down and dirtied on the 
cold concrete of Penguin Park, unwanted. Sakura remembered having once 
found a doll like this at the park; it so depressed her that she took 
the poor forgotten thing home and patched it up. But she couldn&#39;t piece 
together a broken heart with needle and thread. She couldn&#39;t be what 
Tomoyo needed, and some part of her still resented the girl she had 
once called her best friend for putting her in this position; but deep 
in her heart she knew that while it had hurt Tomoyo greatly to say what 
she did, those years of silence had been hurting her infinitely more. 
Looking back on it, she&#39;d noticed that the dark-haired girl had become 
strangely morose over these past few weeks, as if something was 
weighing on her mind. *She must have been thinking of this..... how 
she&#39;d tell me..... She must have been scared, scared that I wouldn&#39;t 
understand, that I&#39;d throw it all back in her face, that I&#39;d hate 
her..........* Sakura felt a tear slide down her own cheek. *.......and 
that&#39;s just what I&#39;ve done............* Her mind screamed out angrily 
at her in a torrent of confusion. *But I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t love her that 
way, I can&#39;t see her that way!! I can&#39;t be that for her...... But.... I 
can&#39;t hate her either................* Finally, shakily, she summoned 
the voice to speak.

       &quot;Tomoyo......... I&#39;m sorry........ I didn&#39;t mean to do 
this.......... I don&#39;t hate you, please don&#39;t ever think I hate you, 
but........... I can&#39;t............&quot; She paused, swallowing dryly and 
blinking hot tears from her eyes. &quot;Please forgive me........ 
Tomoyo...... I&#39;m so sorry.....................&quot;

       If Tomoyo had heard her, she wasn&#39;t responding. Sakura wanted so 
much to help her, wanted to take her back home and make things alright, 
but as hard as she tried to repress it for Tomoyo&#39;s sake, she couldn&#39;t 
help feeling that shudder of revulsion course down her spine at the 
thought that Tomoyo could look at her in..... that way. As much as it 
pained her, there was nothing she could do or say that could make this 
any better. She couldn&#39;t help Tomoyo any more.

       Slowly, sadly, she walked away from Penguin Park as the first 
drops of rain began to fall from a turbulent grey Sunday sky.

       Her words had not penetrated the numbness that gripped the 
pieces of Tomoyo&#39;s shattered soul. Unable to cope even with the 
confusion that raged within her, her mind had shut off the outside 
world, her body lifeless and unfeeling against the hard concrete; the 
faint sparkle of tears in soft, storm-coloured eyes the only sign that 
her broken heart still beat. Tomoyo was not dead. But the only part of 
her that mattered was.

       The sky seemed to mirror the atmosphere of despair that lingered 
over the now despondent-looking little park, grey masses gathering and 
blotting out the light, blanketing Tomoeda in a downpour within 
minutes. People passed through the park intermittently as evening drew 
close, hurrying to their warm, cosy little homes that seemed so far 
away from the primal torrent that lashed the streets, but no one 
noticed the tiny figure lying cold and broken on the ground.  After 
all, Tomoyo didn&#39;t exist without Sakura.

Author&#39;s notes: It&#39;s one minute past midnight, and I&#39;m not sure I can 
sleep now......... ouch......... ;_; I promise, the next one is NOT 
going to be this bad. Might actually be a little hopeful. ^-~;;; Since 
I got some feedback from the last fic with people saying it didn&#39;t fit 
their image of Tomoyo, I&#39;m sorry if this portrayal isn&#39;t in character 
with your concepts of Tomoyo or Sakura. But I am not writing this out 
of pure sadistic satisfaction, going &quot;let&#39;s screw with the characters&#39; 
heads!&quot;, I actually have some experience of what it&#39;s like to be in 
love, and equally what it&#39;s like to be loved by someone you just can&#39;t 
love back. So even if this is OOC for the series, it&#39;s at least based 
on some truth. Again, I&#39;m sorry if I upset any Tomoyo fans, or Sakura 
fans. They&#39;re two of my favourite characters in anything and I don&#39;t 
hate either of them - I love reading fluffy fics about how Sakura 
realises her feelings for Tomoyo, but despite what others say I don&#39;t 
feel it&#39;s realistic (though it would still be wonderful if CLAMP made 
it that way ^-^), and I won&#39;t write something I don&#39;t believe. Maybe if 
my one true love comes through for me, you might actually get something 
romantic out of me one day. ^-^ I hope that one day, I believe enough 
to write it.  

Oh, and props must go to the Amazoness Duo for writing &quot;All I Want For 
Christmas Is You&quot;, a story which inspired some of the imagery in this 
fic.

All comments, criticisms, etc. e-mail to me. I really read all these 
things, y&#39;know, and I *will* reply if you email me, I just sometimes 
get a little behind schedule. ^-^
