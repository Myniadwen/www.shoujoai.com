<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 4 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>        Sakura eased the artifact out of the crate, brushing aside 
packing materials as she looked at the section of wall. Engraved on the 
tile were to figures, a noble appearing young man with angel wings, and 
beside him a massive winged lion. &#39;Li sent it to me from China,&#39; Sakura 
frowned in thought, &#39;could it be linked to the other Clow artifacts?&#39;

        &quot;Miss Sakura?&quot; one of the young men on the Museum staff entered 
nervously to say, &quot;That reporter is here again.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Sakura gave him a smile as she gently put the tile 
down on a cotton sheet. She wrapped it carefully before stowing it away 
in a protective drawer. She turned to ask, &quot;Did she say what she wanted 
to see me about?&quot;

        &quot;She didn&#39;t really say,&quot; he said before heading back upstairs.

        Sakura frowned, picking up her labcoat from a nearby table and 
pulling it on. All around her on various surfaces artifacts of one type 
or another sat, being prepared for restoration or display. Gold, silver, 
iron and stone, Sakura cautiously made her way through them all towards 
the door, locking it behind her as she left. It was a short walk up the 
stairs into the public parts of the city museum, then she went looking 
for Tomoyo.

        Sakura walked around, looking in the various sections of the 
grand museum for Tomoyo. Eventually she made her way to the China 
exhibit and looked over the many artifacts that she had helped recover 
so recently. A set of silken robes hung in a display case, blue edged in 
gold, while nearby an odd staff rested, the design incorporating a sun 
and moon on the top. Tomoyo stood in front of the cases, studying them 
curiously.

        &quot;The metalwork on that staff is remarkable,&quot; Sakura said to her 
softly as she came up from behind Tomoyo, &quot;centuries ahead of it&#39;s 
time.&quot;

        As Tomoyo turned to see her standing there, the reporter smiling 
at her slightly. The woman&#39;s long black hair fell around her, dressed in 
a stylish business suit. &quot;You&#39;re a mess,&quot; Tomoyo surprised Sakura by 
stepping forward, wiping a smudge off of Sakura&#39;s nose.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Sakura blushed, looking down shyly as she said, &quot;I was 
helping out over in our restoration&#39;s department. I&#39;m not so good with 
the fine work, but I&#39;m a wizz at cleaning.&quot;

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Tomoyo nodded. The reporter tilted her head to the side 
and asked, &quot;Do you have any plans for tonight?&quot;

        &quot;I wasn&#39;t planning to go out,&quot; Sakura looked at her in surprise, 
reaching up to touch the necklace she wore, the enchanted charm hanging 
from it.

        &quot;That&#39;s not quite what I meant,&quot; Tomoyo said. She shrugged, &quot;I 
was going to go out and grab some dinner, I was wondering if you&#39;d care 
to join me?&quot;

        &quot;Hoeee?&quot; Sakura blinked in surprise.

        &quot;Nothing improper,&quot; Tomoyo hastened to say with a charming 
smile, &quot;I was just hoping we could talk a bit.&quot;

        Sakura studied her a moment before saying, &quot;I... I think I&#39;d 
like that.&quot; She looked down at her dusty clothes, &quot;But do you know a 
place where I won&#39;t get thrown out?&quot;

        Tomoyo looked her up and down, and Sakura felt her cheeks color 
at the admiration in her gaze. &quot;Even dusty,&quot; Tomoyo said, &quot;you look 
good.&quot; She took Sakura&#39;s hand, &quot;Come on!&quot;

        Tomoyo tugged her forward and Sakura laughed softly, the two 
walking out of the museum together. Sakura slowed once they reached the 
sports car waiting for them, &quot;I&#39;ll mess up the seats!&quot;

        Tomoyo just chuckled, opening up the passenger door, &quot;Trust me, 
it&#39;s not a problem.&quot;

        Sakura pulled her lab coat off, covering up the seat with her 
white lab coat. &quot;There,&quot; Sakura gave Tomoyo a smile, sitting down 
smoothly.

        &quot;Nice,&quot; Tomoyo acknowledged. She slid behind the wheel and 
started up the car. The engine purred like a cat, then with a throaty 
roar they smoothly pulled out into traffic.

        &quot;So where are we headed?&quot; Sakura asked, peering into the 
rearview mirror and trying to tidy herself up a bit. Finally she sat 
back with a sigh, &quot;It&#39;s hopeless.&quot;

        &quot;No it&#39;s not,&quot; Tomoyo smiled. She turned onto a side street, 
pulling in front of a high class boutique. &quot;First we&#39;ll get you 
changed,&quot; she got out then opened up Sakura&#39;s door.

        &quot;What?&quot; Sakura blinked.

        &quot;You were complaining that you were too messy to go out,&quot; Tomoyo 
laughed, &quot;so we&#39;re going to fix that now.&quot; She lead them back to the 
clothes racks, quickly judging Sakura&#39;s size by a glance, &quot;Do you prefer 
pants or dresses?&quot;

        &quot;Dresses,&quot; Sakura stammered, &quot;but I can&#39;t let you....&quot;

        Tomoyo took a rose evening gown out of the rack, tilting her 
head to the side to study Sakura thoughtfully. &quot;Trust me, I can afford 
it,&quot; she smiled. She paused, &quot;And I like doing this sort of thing. I 
probably would have been a close designer if I hadn&#39;t become a 
reporter.&quot;

        &quot;You always wanted a life-sized Barbie when you were growing up, 
didn&#39;t you?&quot; Sakura complained good-naturedly as Tomoyo handed the 
blushing woman a set of fancy underwear to go along with the dress.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t really need one,&quot; Tomoyo gave her an impish grin, &quot;I 
just made my bodyguards dress up how I wanted them too.&quot; She lead Sakura 
through the store, &quot;Skirt, underwear, stockings..&quot; she snagged a set of 
fine shoes then beamed, &quot;Go get changed, I&#39;ll pay for this.&quot;

        Sakura blinked as Tomoyo strode to the cashier, then with a 
shake of her head she headed to a change room. &#39;She just kind of bowled 
me over,&#39; Sakura mused as she stripped, then pulled on the new clothes. 
She looked at the changing room mirror and whispered, &quot;Wow.&quot;

        Sakura stepped out of the changing room in her new heels and 
Tomoyo looked up curiously. The black haired woman&#39;s eyes widened as her 
lips curled up in a smile. She walked over to where Sakura stood and 
simply said, &quot;You look lovely.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks to you,&quot; Sakura answered with a warm smile. While in the 
changing room she had used a comb in her pocket to tidy her hair and was 
a bit surprised to have Tomoyo reach up to ruffle it slightly. &quot;What was 
that for?&quot; she protested.

        &quot;It looks better that way,&quot; Tomoyo offered her arm to Sakura, 
and together they left the store, Sakura&#39;s old clothes in a store bag. 
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind my taking charge like that,&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s voice was 
gentle, &quot;it&#39;s a habit I picked up from my mother.&quot;

        &quot;The business-woman Sonomi Daidouji,&quot; Sakura nodded as the two 
of them climbed back into the car, pausing only to toss her labcoat in 
the back with her old clothes. She sighed softly, &quot;My mother talked 
about her occasionally, just not around my dad.&quot;

        &quot;Why was that?&quot; Tomoyo asked curiously as they moved out into 
traffic once again, keeping a careful eye on the other cars on the road.

        Sakura was a bit uncomfortable as she admitted, &quot;I got the 
feeling my father never really got along with your mom.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll have to ask Sonomi about it,&quot; Tomoyo said thoughtfully. 
The woman drove with the minimum amount of movement, guiding her car 
with gentle skill.

        &quot;How much did all of this cost?&quot; Sakura had to ask, gesturing 
down to her new outfit, &quot;I&#39;d like to pay you back later.&quot;

        &quot;Friends don&#39;t need to pay back things,&quot; Tomoyo looked over at 
Sakura with a engaging smile, &quot;and I&#39;m hoping we&#39;ll become friends.&quot;

        Sakura was a bit surprised to hear such... loneliness in 
Tomoyo&#39;s voice. She smiled back and said, &quot;I hope we will be, too.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Tomoyo grinned as they pulled up in front of a 
restaurant. She got out first, walking around to open Sakura&#39;s door for 
her. &quot;Shall we?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d be honored,&quot; Sakura rose to take Tomoyo&#39;s hand. She felt a 
bit of relief as they walked towards the door. The restaurant was nice, 
but not too high class. &quot;The Rose,&quot; Sakura murmured, &quot;I&#39;ve never been 
here before.&quot;

        &quot;It was recommended to me by a friend,&quot; Tomoyo walked her 
forward smoothly. The young man at the till smiled as they entered, 
recognizing Tomoyo. She smiled and said, &quot;Good evening Jim. I&#39;m sorry to 
say we don&#39;t have a reservation.&quot;

        Jim smiled, blonde hair falling into his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sure we can 
find a seat for you two,&quot; he beamed, pressing a switch on his desk. A 
young waitress arrived and he said, &quot;Take Miss Tomoyo and her guest to 
booth number nine, please.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; the blonde waitress beamed and led the two ladies in.

        Sakura looked around her, the comfortable but unpretentious 
decoration of the place pleasing to the eye. Her eyes widened as she 
noticed both same sex and mixed couples sitting intimately close. 
&#39;Interesting place for dinner,&#39; Sakura mused.</pre>
