<h1>Love Forever (part 1 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>WARNING: MAJOR CHARACTER DEATH! WELL... NOT REALLY, BUT HE MIGHT AS WELL 
BE DEAD AFTER WHAT I DID TO HIM IN THIS STORY.^_^; HEH HEH HEH.


Authors Note: Is it just me, or does anyone else think that the Hope 
card looks alot like Nadeshiko? (Anyone who&#39;s seen the second movie 
knows what I&#39;m talking about.) I know it&#39;s been done before, but I like 
the idea of Sakura using her Magic instead of Sayoran to get herself 
Pregnant. I don&#39;t think anyone has written it quite like me, but if they 
have, I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to steal your idea. Now, on with the 
story!

  

Tomoyo sighed heavily when she sat down on her couch with a bag of 
popcorn after putting in a movie. It was another typical Saturday for 
her. She would walk down to the store, buy some snacks, rent some movies 
and go home to her Penthouse to watch them... alone. She fell asleep 
soon after but was woken up by her doorbell ringing. She paused the 
movie and switched her T.V. to the Security channel to see who it was. 
It was Sakura. She was out of breath and her face was all red and puffy 
from crying. She pressed the door release button and told her to come 
up. Just as Sakura was about to knock, the door opened, startling her. 
She lunged at Tomoyo and hugged her with all her might. Tomoyo closed 
the door and led Sakura over to the couch.

&quot;Here...sit.&quot;

She sat her down and went to the kitchen to get her a glass of water and 
some tissues. She handed Sakura the water and set the box of tissues on 
the coffee table in front of them. She put her hand on Sakura&#39;s shoulder 
and sat down beside her.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Sakura? And where&#39;s Li-kun?&quot;

Sakura cringed at hearing his name and threw herself into Tomoyo&#39;s 
chest, sobbing heavily.

&quot;Tom...Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ok Sakura, I&#39;m here. Please tell me what&#39;s wrong. Sakura-chan 
isn&#39;t Sakura-chan when she&#39;s sad.&quot;

Sakura forced a smile and started telling her what happened.

&quot;It&#39;s Li. He&#39;s gone.&quot;

&quot;Gone!? What do you mean gone!?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s in jail.&quot;

&quot;What! Why!?&quot;

&quot;About a month ago, he made some new friends at work and he introduced 
them to me. They seemed like nice enough guys at first, but I knew there 
was something more. 2 weeks later, he started acting strange and I asked 
him why. All he said was that it was none of my business and to leave 
him alone. That hurt me, alot. He kept coming home at all hours of the 
night, sometimes the morning after. I was doing laundry one day when I 
felt something in his pocket and pulled it out. It was a used syringe. I 
had it tested by a friend of mine at the Hospital and found out that it 
had Methamphetamine in it. When I confronted him about it, he slapped me 
and said that he could do whatever he wanted.&quot;

Tomoyo was furious! She couldn&#39;t believe that Sayoran had started using 
Drugs! What was even harder to believe was that he actually hit Sakura! 
How could he! She handed Sakura a tissue and asked her to continue.

&quot;One night when he was out with his &#39;friends&#39; I decided to leave him. I 
had no idea where I could go, so I went to his mothers place and told 
her what happened. She said that she felt an evil presence start to 
overwhelm him and that things would only get worse. He came over the 
next day but was told by his mother that he was no longer welcome in her 
home and he left. She said that I could stay with her until I figured 
things out. About a week ago, I recieved a call from a civil defense 
lawyer and he told me that Li had been arrested after robbing a store 
and kidnapping the female clerk. He asked me to meet with him and I 
did.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s looking at some serious jail time. Armed Robbery and Kidnapping 
are very serious crimes, and given his current addiction to 
Methamphetamine... I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much I can do for him.&quot;

&quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot; I asked.

&quot;You&#39;re his wife aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Not anymore. I don&#39;t want anything to do with him. I hope he goes away 
for a long time.&quot;

&quot;I thanked him for filling me in and left. When I got back to Li&#39;s 
mothers, I told her that I decided to come back to Japan, back to the 
only people that cared and loved me. She said that she would help and 
bought me my plane ticket home. I accepted and told her that I was sorry 
for any trouble I caused. She told me I wasn&#39;t and said it was her that 
should be sorry for not noticing the problems with Li sooner. She told 
me that even though Li was no longer welcome, I was, and that she wanted 
me to return for a visit someday soon. I agreed. I packed up and took 
the first plane I could to get here.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you call Sakura!? You know I would have picked you up at the 
Airport right?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to be a bother. I caused so much trouble in Hong Kong, 
causing Li to turn to drugs and...&quot;

She was snapped out of her speech by Tomoyo&#39;s hand slapping her cheek. 
Not hard, but enough to sting and leave a small red mark on her face.

&quot;Don&#39;t you ever, ever say that! You didn&#39;t cause him to turn to drugs! 
You could never do anything to make someone do that! That was his own 
stupidity! And nobody else&#39;s!&quot;

With her hand on her cheek where Tomoyo had slapped her, Sakura looked 
at her friend. She hugged her and thanked her for always being there for 
her. Tomoyo sat with Sakura until she calmed down and stopped crying. 
She  stood up and headed for the kitchen.

&quot;Now... I bet you&#39;re hungry aren&#39;t you Sakura?&quot;

&quot;Uh... no, not really. I ate a little on the plane.&quot;

Her stomach betrayed her with a loud growl and she sweatdropped.

&quot;I thought so. It&#39;s a long flght from Hong Kong to Japan, and that 
Airline food is nasty! I didn&#39;t think you would eat much.&quot;

Sakura giggled and thanked her again.

&quot;There&#39;s some clothes you can wear in my closet. Dinner&#39;s going to be 
about an hour, so why don&#39;t you have a shower and freshen up?&quot; Tomoyo 
said from the kitchen.
