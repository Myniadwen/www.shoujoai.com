<P>Author's Prelude to a Fanfictional Quest: </B></I></FONT>Konnichiwa fanfic 
reader! Well, 'tis me again! This time it's a songfic that will implement the 
song "Eyes on Me" written by Nobuo Uematsu (I believe) and performed by Faye 
Wong. For the uneducated, this song appeared in Final Fantasy VIII (I know it's 
rather old...). BTW, this is my first songfic, so you might as well bare with me 
if it isn't up to par with the other ones out there. So, anyway, the fanfic will 
be a Tomoyo-Sakura 'fic. If you're offended by love between girls (or Shoujo-ai, 
if you prefer), I suggest you stay away and bother someone else and/or hug a 
tree. WORTHWHILE comments are welcome. So, enjoy the 
story!</P><I>
<P>Story Note:</I> The story will be told in Tomoyo's perspective throughout. 
The song lyrics will be in Italics. It will mostly consist of thought and 
recollection of Tomoyo thoughts about her unrequited love. Let's just see how it 
will go, shall we?</P>
<P>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>&nbsp;<I>~Whenever sang my songs</P>
<P>On the stage, on my own</P>
<P>Whenever said my words</P>
<P>Wishing they would be heard...~</P>
<P><BR>
<P></I>I keep replaying the scene over and over in my mind; the scene in which I 
told Sakura-chan how much I loved her. Yet, no matter how I said it, it always 
came out ways she couldn't comprehend. Yes, she has told me that she "loved me", 
but it was always in matters and friendship and companionship. </P>
<P>I wish she would have heard it. I wish she would've have heard the true 
messages within my actions and words. It would be so different now; My life 
wouldn't be as futile and as sullen as it is now...</P><I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>~I saw you smiling at me</P>
<P>Was it real or just my fantasy</P>
<P>You'd always be there in the corner</P>
<P>of this tiny little bar...~&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P></I>No matter how oblivious she is to my feelings for her are, I will always 
try my best to make her happy. Ever since our paths crossed, I've believed that 
I was fated by the gods to make her as glorious and happy as she can be. I felt 
like I was her guardian angel. And no matter my internal pain, I smiled at her, 
although feigned. I couldn't worry her about me. I was just there to give 
support, and endure years of her kindness, beauty, friendship, and flippant 
attitude. This is why I would try to be the first person in class; I couldn't 
wait to see her next to me after saying, "Ohayoo Gozaimasu Sakura-chan" and 
dream about her the rest of the day...</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P><I>
<P>~My last night here with you</P>
<P>Some old songs, just once more</P>
<P>My last night here with you?</P>
<P>Maybe yes, maybe no...~</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp; </I>I don't know what to do now. I'm so befuddled with my life right 
now. I'm even thinking about leaving Japan for good. My unrequited love for 
Sakura is just tearing me up inside. Maybe I should start a new life somewhere, 
but I don't think I can start a new life without Sakura-chan's presence before 
me. She is my "lifeblood". Without her, moving somewhere wouldn't make much of a 
difference. I would just miss her ever more, furthering the regression of my 
already-damaged soul. Gods, What should I do? Maybe I should see her-and talk to 
her...</P>
<P>I asked my mother if the bodyguards could drive me to Sakura-chan's house. 
She gladly accepted my plea, and then began to devulge more about her 
experiences with Nadeshiko on how she would visit her as much as she can. My 
mother must've really loved her, because I too I'm feeling the same towards 
Sakura-chan as my mother was with Nadeshiko. </P>
<P>I called Sakura-chan and heard her answer the phone. She has a such a 
wonderful and beautiful voice. I felt my heart pound intensely as I spoke to 
her. I told her I was going there because I needed to talk to her about 
something. She asked if I was okay because it seemed my voice wasn't the usually 
tone Sakura-chan was used to hearing. I just gave her my usual feigned emotional 
stability over the phone. I told her I would be going there later. I said I 
needed to talk to her. She accepted my wish. She said she would wait outside her 
house for me. I then bombarded her with more of my usual gratification to her 
before I hung up. </P>
<P>I arrived at the front her house. As I exited the car, I saw her; her 
beautiful emerald eyes gazing at me with such tenderness. I approached her, only 
to nearly stumble. Fortunately, Sakura-chan caught me before I hit the ground. I 
felt so embarrassed, but being held by her made me even redder as my heart 
continued to beat harder and harder...</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P><I>
<P>~Darling, so there you are </P>
<P>With that look on your face</P>
<P>As if you're never hurt</P>
<P>As if you're never down...~</P></I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sakura-chan led me through the door. The house was virtually empty, except 
for Kero-chan; he sitting on the kitchen table relishing a slice of strawberry 
cake on the kitchen table. I greeted him, while he answered with a muffled 
"hello". I giggled. It was nice to laugh a little, considering the tension I was 
feeling. As I turned away, Sakura-chan told a hold my hand and led me to her 
room. I gazed at our clasped hands. Oh how I wish I could experience this 
everyday of my life.</P>
<P>Sakura-chan and I both sat on her bed. We stayed rather silent for a while, 
until Sakura-chan seemed to notice something was bothering me. She looked 
straight at me with a look of great concern.</P>
<P>"Tomoyo-chan, are you okay? You seem really bothered by something," she said. 
</P>
<P>"Ano...it's nothing..." I said, blantly lying to myself-as I always did 
around Sakura-chan.</P>
<P>"...You can't lie to me Tomoyo-chan. I know there is something bothering you. 
I can see it...in your eyes. Please, let me help you Tomoyo-chan. What <I>is</I> 
wrong?"</P>
<P>I turned away from her gaze. "It's just that..." <I>Why is saying 'I love 
you' so hard? I'm acting like a complete baka right now...</P>
<P></I>Sakura-chan then placed her hand on my cheek and moved my head to face 
her. I felt a deluge of redness rush to my complexion as she touched me. 
"Please, whatever you have to say, say it while we gaze into each others eyes," 
Sakura-chan said. The way she said it, almost gave me this feeling; a feeling 
that tells me that I'm not the only one in love...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>~<I>Shall I be the one for you</P>
<P>Who pinches you softly but sure</P>
<P>If frown is shown then</P>
<P>I will know that you are no dreamer...~</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></I>
<P>I gazed at her pleaded eyes and finally conjured the courage to tell her how 
much I love her. I've never felt so nervous in my life. I took a hold of 
Sakura-chan's hand and challenged fate...</P>
<P>"Sakura-chan...what I want to tell you is that...you're very special to me 
and... What I really want to tell you is that I...love you. I-love-you 
Sakura-chan." Tears began to flow from my eyes. I couldn't hold back any longer. 
"I hope you understand...please understand Sakura-chan. I don't want this to end 
my friendship with you... I just had to tell you this...please forgive me." I 
buried my face on my hands, frightened to face rejection...</P>
<P>"Please don't cry Tomoyo-chan. I'm still here. You don't have to be afraid. I 
will always be by your side. It's okay..." Sakura-chan embraced me tightly and 
pressed her body against mine. I, too, wrapped my arms around her. She then 
rested her head on my shoulder. I heard her whisper-barely audible-but the 
message was so clear to me...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>~<I>So let me come to you</P>
<P>Close as I wanted to be</P>
<P>Close enough for me</P>
<P>To feel your heart beating fast...~</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></I>
<P>Sakura-chan continued to hold onto me, while she whispered to me words I've 
dreamed for so long to hear.</P>
<P>"I could feel your heart Tomoyo-chan. It's beating so fast. But, try and feel 
my heart Tomoyo-chan. It's beating as fast as yours. You know why? I, too, have 
a confession to make. I've been waiting so long for this oppurtunity. Now it's 
my chance to tell you... I love you too Tomoyo-chan..."</P>
<P>I broke the embrace, staring wide-eyed at Sakura-chan. I couldn't believe 
what I was hearing. Sakura-chan...was...in love with me? A plethora of emotions 
enveloped me. However, the only emotions I felt were only feelings of joy and 
finally happiness...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;~<I>And stay there as I whisper</P>
<P>How I loved you peaceful eyes on me</P>
<P>Did you ever know</P>
<P>That I had mine on you...~</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P></I>"Sakura-chan? Do you really...love me?" I asked to be completely sure I 
heard her correctly.</P>
<P>"Yes. Yes, I love you with all my heart Tomoyo-chan. It just took me so long 
to realize that you are the one for me. Only you..."</P>
<P>"Sakura-chan...I love you with all my heart too. Ever since I've met you, I 
couldn't keep my eyes off you in both keen friendship and passionate love. I 
just couldn't tell you...because I was afraid."</P>
<P>"I understand Tomoyo-chan. It's okay. I was afraid too. That's why I never 
told you sooner. But when you declared your love for me, I finally had a chance 
to tell you. I'm so glad you told me. If you hadn't, I don't know if I would've 
told you. Please forgive me Tomoyo-chan. I'm sorry I've caused you so much 
pain."</P>
<P>"I'm not angry at you Sakura-chan. I can never be angry with you. This whole 
ordeal has given a lot of grief and pain, even to the point of me planning to 
leave Japan. But, I knew in the end, my Sakura-chan would come through for me." 
</P>
<P>"Tomoyo-chan...I promise I will <I>never </I>cause you any pain. I swear this 
on my life. I vow to protect you forever-and love you forever..."</P>
<P>We leaned closer to each other and caressed each others cheeks. We leaned 
even closer, gazing each other with such intensity-such passion. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>~<I>Darling, so share with me</P>
<P>Your love if you have enough</P>
<P>Your tears if you're holding back</P>
<P>Or pain if that's what it is...~</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></I>
<P>Our lips brushed together, and finally connected. The dark cloud over my soul 
has lifted; My scars have healed; My life is worth living again; I feel whole 
again. All of this has been done with a simple, but passionate kiss from my 
beloved.</P>
<P>We broke the kiss then held each other snuggly. We both wept tears of joy 
declaring our love for each other repeatedly. We finally were happy, and it 
couldn't be any better than being in Sakura-chan's loving arms. We continued to 
hold each other throughout under the romance of the beautiful moonlit night.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>~<I>How can I let you know</P>
<P>I'm more than the dress and the voice</P>
<P>Just reach me out then</P>
<P>you will know that you're not dreaming.~</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P></I>We both awoke bathed in the sunlight. We found each other, and realized 
we both haven't been dreaming. The dreams we've had come to a conclusion. We 
finally start a new fate together basking in the realm of reality. We will 
cherish our love everyday forever, and always remember that fateful day in which 
we gazed into each other's passionate eyes and said "I love you".</P>

<P>Author's Epilogue to a Fanfictional Quest: </B></I></FONT>Gomen nasai, but in 
my previous story "Dreaming of Sakura", I promised a longer and better 'fic. Yet 
again, I failed. This story didn't pan out so well for me, but I wanted to 
finish it since I went far into it. I'm writing these stories half-asleep. But 
with Summer VA-CA, I should get a few more stories into my "to-do" list. I just 
hope you enjoy what I have on the table write now. Once I get my studies out of 
the way, I can finally focus on creative writing...and watching more and more 
anime /\_/\. Anyway, thanks for reading and see you again someday! Let me just 
catch up some sleep and I'll be fine... </P><B>
<P>UP NEXT: </B><I>More <B>CCS: Sakura/Tomoyo fics </B>and possibly a 
<B>Koutetsu Tenshi Kurumi </B>fic (<B>Steel Angel Kurumi</B>) coming up in the 
future. </P></I></BODY></HTML>
