<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 22 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>&quot;Tomoyo,&quot; Sakura said tentatively as the feathered
cape swirled around the reddish brown haired woman,
the bright pink costume glittering in the setting
sunlight, &quot;I really don&#39;t think this costume is suited
to monster hunting.&quot;

&quot;All right, the sequins might be a bit much,&quot; Tomoyo
conceded, the black haired woman studying Sakura
fondly.

Sakura smiled wryly as she asked her, &quot;Well, do you
have something else I could try on?&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; Tomoyo said cheerfully as she lead Sakura
over to the car where several uniforms were in garment
bags on the seat.

&quot;This is your hobby, I take it?&quot; Sakura teased as she
picked up a mostly black and sky blue colored costume.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Tomoyo agreed readily as she said, &quot;and I&#39;ve
always liked seeing a beautiful woman in lovely
clothes.&quot;

Sakura blushed charmingly as she unwrapped the pants,
top and other pieces of gear. &quot;Could you...?&quot; Sakura
made a turning gesture, thankful that the alley they
were in would provide enough cover for a quick change.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Tomoyo turned, her simple pant suit
blending into the slowly spreading shadows of the
evening. She was careful not to tell Sakura that a
dirty window just in front of Tomoyo made a pretty
good mirror on Sakura&#39;s changing.

Sakura took off the bright colored cape first, folding
it respectfully, then pulled up the top, her bra-less
breasts bouncing a bit as she moved. Gracefully she
hooked her fingers into the tight pants and tugged
down, revealing pink underwear in a frilly design.

&#145;Damn,&#39; a flushed Tomoyo squeezed her eyes shut for a
moment, feeling a little bit of guilt and the
beginnings of a nosebleed coming on.

Finally dressed Sakura walked over and tapped Tomoyo
on the shoulder, blinking when Tomoyo turned and she
saw the trickle of blood from the other woman&#39;s nose.
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; she asked Tomoyo worriedly.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Tomoyo promised as she took a hankie from
her breast pocket and wiped her nose. A smile, &quot;I
think that costume suits you.&quot;

Sakura smiled back, now wearing the black pants and
shirt, all designed with a light blue trim. The gloves
and boots matched, with flared cuffs for style, and a
high collar on the shirt to give it a almost pirate
air.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Sakura tried a few jumps, pleased to see
how easy it was to wear.

&#145;Not bad at all,&#39; Tomoyo thought, watching Sakura
move. Shaking herself she asked, &quot;Do we have any leads
tonight?&quot;

&quot;Some odd sightings,&quot; Sakura confirmed, &quot;not far from
here.&quot;

Tomoyo readied her digital camera, wishing that Yukito
was here. However, he had quite reasonably put his
foot down and insisted on a night out with Toya, so
what was she to do? &quot;Monster or Clow Card?&quot; she asked
curiously.

&quot;Not sure,&quot; Sakura admitted as she made sure her
necklace was easy to get at, in case they encountered
trouble.

&quot;Well,&quot; Tomoyo said after making sure the car was
locked up, &quot;let&#39;s go.&quot;

A few softly chanted words transformed the key she
wore around her neck into a staff, then Sakura drew
forth a card from a pouch on her belt. &quot;Fly!&quot; she
cried and struck the card with her staff, invoking
it&#39;s power and summoning white wings that soon
stretched from her back. &quot;Shall we?&quot; she offered
Tomoyo her hand.

&quot;Please,&quot; Tomoyo agreed as she stepped close to Sakura
and gently wrapped her arms around her. &#145;This feels so
nice,&#39; she mused.

&quot;Hup,&quot; and with a jump Sakura threw them into the air,
the soft beat of her wings drawing them up into the
darkening sky.

Tomoyo tightened her arms around Sakura, feeling her
firm breasts pressed against her own, then forced
herself to relax a bit as she swept the slightly run
down section of the city with her eyes. The dark
alley&#39;s and streets stretched around them, only a few
people lingering here and there in the shadows.

&quot;The city is kind of pretty, at least when seen from
way up here,&quot; Tomoyo noted a bit breathlessly.

Sakura nodded as they soared along, &quot;You&#39;re right,
I...&quot;

&quot;AIEEEEEE!&quot; the voice pierced the darkness.

&quot;Sakura, over there,&quot; Tomoyo pointed wet even as
Sakura changed direction in mid-air, her wings beating
faster.

&quot;I see it,&quot; Sakura answered grimly.

Sweeping back down to the dark streets Sakura and
Tomoyo raced to where a young woman lay sprawled on
the ground, her long black hair fanning around her.
Above her a mysterious light shimmered, swirling and
changing.

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Tomoyo murmured, her camera
filming the beautiful apparition, it&#39;s colors
strangely hypnotic.

&quot;I...&quot; Sakura trailed off, swaying slightly as her
eyes widened.

Almost instinctively Tomoyo pulled Sakura back, then
frowned as the other woman just looked at her blankly.
&quot;Sakura?&quot; Tomoyo shook her gently, but the other girl
seemed completely entranced. &#145;I hate this,&#39; she
thought then slapped her, hard.

&quot;Ahh,&quot; Sakura jerked in surprise, looking at Tomoyo in
shock.

&quot;You all right?&quot; Tomoyo asked her tenderly, glad to
see that Sakura&#39;s eyes were clear once more.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Sakura admitted, &quot;I saw my mother...&quot;

&quot;I thought she was dead?&quot; Tomoyo blinked.

&quot;She is,&quot; Sakura&#39;s eyes hardened with anger as she
clutched her staff.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t a... ghost, was it?&quot; Tomoyo looked just a
bit nervously at the shining light still dancing in
mid air.

Sakura saw the fear in Tomoyo&#39;s eye and smiled, for a
moment shedding her anger. &quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I think
it&#39;s a Clow card.&quot;

&quot;Oh good,&quot; Tomoyo whipped out her camera, &quot;ready!&quot;

Sakura sweatdropped. &quot;Right,&quot; she turned to the light,
raising her key-staff at the ready position. Over the
years she had done a lot of research, as well as
exchanged information with Li, and with that she had a
good guess what she was dealing with.

The light shimmered, shifting, but this time not into
her mother. Instead a image of Tomoyo appeared, but
not the usual version. Naked she extended a hand in
invitation, her breasts rising and falling as she gave
Sakura a seductive look...

&quot;No,&quot; Sakura shoot off the spell, summoning her will.
&quot;Illusion card, return to your power confined,&quot; she
yelled as she struck with her staff, &quot;Illusion!&quot; The
woman flickered a moment, her dress sparkling, then
with a wordless curse swirled into the form of a card
and dropped into Sakura&#39;s hands.

&quot;Oooh, very nice,&quot; Tomoyo said as she put the camera
away. She gave Sakura a curious look, &quot;It seemed like
she tried her illusions on you again, what did you
see?&quot;

Sakura blushed beet red. &quot;It was nothing,&quot; she lied.

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Tomoyo raised a eyebrow as they started
back to the car. &quot;Tell,&quot; she insisted.

&quot;No,&quot; Sakura shook her head.

&quot;Please?&quot; Tomoyo batted her eyes.

Sakura fought back a laugh, &quot;Still no.&quot;

&quot;Aww, come on!&quot;

&quot;No, no, no.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll give you a cookie?&quot;

&quot;Tomoyo!&quot;
