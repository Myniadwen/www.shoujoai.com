<h1>Trick or Treat (part 6 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/tricktreat-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>When Tomoyo arrived, she suggested that they do their homework before 
getting down to business. So, her and Sakura went upstairs and started. 

&quot;What should we do first?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I know how much you hate math, so why don&#39;t we get it out of the 
way.&quot; 

&quot;Great.&quot; 

Sakura&#39;s eyes kept straying to the two packages that Tomoyo had brought 
with her, but she kept at it until all their math homework was finished. 
They didn&#39;t have alot of other homework, so it didn&#39;t take long before 
they were finished. 

&quot;There! Finally!&quot; Exclaimed Sakura. &quot;Maybe I should use the Erase Card 
and wipe out all of the Math homework in the school.&quot; 

&quot;Heh, heh. I don&#39;t think Tereda Sensei would like that.&quot; Replied Tomoyo. 

&quot;Can I see the costumes now Tomoyo-chan?&quot; 

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we tidy up and get ready for bed first?&quot; 

&quot;Pretty please?&quot; 

&quot;Geez Sakura-chan, you&#39;re like a little kid on Christmas morning! I 
swear!&quot; 

&quot;I want to make you happy Tomoyo-chan. I know how much you love making 
outfits for me, and you love videotaping me in them... don&#39;t you?&quot; 

&quot;Of course! Everything Sakura-chan does should be forever recorded on 
tape!&quot; Tomoyo said while walking over to the boxes she brought in with 
her. 

She picked up the one with her costume inside and told Sakura to turn 
around while she put it on. Sakura sat on her bed and turned to face the 
window until Tomoyo was ready. It took a while, but Tomoyo was finished 
and told Sakura that she could turn around and look now. Sakura turned 
and faced her friend. A light crimson blush formed on her face as she 
saw Tomoyo dressed in a very elaborate, and beautiful Princess Costume 
that she was positive had no equal in the world. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan! You&#39;re so beautiful! But then again... you always have 
been.&quot; Said Sakura as she drew closer to her Princess. She pulled her 
close and looked at her with her blazing green orbs, her face only mere 
inches from Tomoyo&#39;s. 

&quot;Sakura-chan....&quot; Was all Tomoyo got out as Sakura forcefully pulled her 
into a deep, passionate kiss. Tomoyo&#39;s body tensing, then slowly 
relaxing as she kissed back with all the love she could give. Both girls 
sighed contently as they broke the kiss that neither wanted to end. 

&quot;Let me guess Tomoyo-chan... mine is a Prince&#39;s costume, right?&quot;   

&quot;No. Every time we go to a dance, or out to dinner or a special event 
together, we end up going as a matched set. Or opposites. So this time I 
decided on two completely different outfits for us.&quot; 

Tomoyo picked up the box that contained Sakura&#39;s outfit and gave it to 
her. 

&quot;You&#39;re going to look perfect in it Sakura-chan.&quot; 

Sakura was about to open the box when there was a knock on her bedroom 
door. 

&quot;Come in.&quot; 

&quot;Sakura.... is Tomoyo in here?&quot; 

&quot;Yes. I&#39;m here Touya. What is it?&quot; 

&quot;Can I talk to you downstairs for a minute?&quot; 

&quot;Sure. I&#39;ll be right there.&quot; 

Touya nodded and closed the door. As soon as it was closed, he ran to 
the bathroom and told Kero to get ready. He checked to make sure 
everything was in place and hurried downstairs to meet Tomoyo. 

&quot;Go ahead and change Sakura-chan. When you&#39;re done, come downstairs so 
you can show everybody ok?&quot; 

&quot;Hai.&quot; 

Tomoyo went downstairs as Sakura headed to the bathroom to change into 
her costume. 

&quot;What did you want to talk about Touya?&quot; 

&quot;Actually... I was wondering if I could borrow your Camcorder for a 
minute?&quot; 

&quot;Ok... may I ask what for?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;ll see in a minute.&quot; Said Touya as he set up the Camera so he could 
catch Sakura&#39;s reaction to his surprise. 

Upstairs, Sakura entered the bathroom and started to undress. She 
stripped down to her underwear and opened the box that Tomoyo gave her. 
Inside was a short, black Mini-skirt, black long sleeved shirt and 
fish-net stockings. There was also a pair of knee high leather boots and 
a small Witches hat.  

&quot;I guess she wants me to be a Witch this year huh?&quot; Sakura said 
laughing. &quot;At least I won&#39;t have to wear ugly green make-up, or put a 
huge fake wart on my nose! That&#39;s one of the great things about Tomoyo&#39;s 
outfits... if it doesn&#39;t suit me, she&#39;ll make it suit me.&quot; 

Sakura pulled out all of the peices to her costume. Or so she thought. 
After removing the boots, she saw two other items stuffed into the 
bottom of the box. She pulled one of them out and held it up to get a 
better look. She sweatdropped. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan....&quot; She said whining as she looked at the pair of black 
and orange panties she was holding. In the box was a matching bra. 

&quot;That&#39;s Tomoyo... she always has to co-ordinate everything.&quot; 

Sakura sighed and took off what remained of her clothes. She put on her 
new &#39;Halloween&#39; underwear, and laid out the rest of her clothes. Kero 
meanwhile, was hiding in the shower and starting to grow impatient at 
how long this was taking. He had enough and made a loud noise by 
knocking over a shampoo bottle into the tub, startling Sakura. 

&quot;What was that!?&quot; Sakura said out loud. She walked over to the shower 
curtain and pulled it back, expecting to find what had made the noise. 
As soon as she pulled the curtain back, Kero pulled a string, causing a 
massive spider to jump out at her. 

&quot;HOEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!&quot; She screamed as she bolted from the bathroom. She 
ran downstairs as fast as she could and hid behind Tomoyo. 

&quot;What!? What is it Sakura-chan!?&quot; 

&quot;Sp...sp...&quot; 

&quot;Spider?&quot; 

Tomoyo could feel Sakura shake her head yes and looked over at Touya, 
who was litterally rolling on the floor laughing. Kero flew down seconds 
later asking how it worked. 

&quot;Gr...gre..ha,ha,ha,ha....&quot; He couldn&#39;t even speak he was laughing so 
hard. 

Sakura was shaking with anger as she stood up. Touya and Kero took one 
look at her and started howling again. 

&quot;Ha,ha,ha,ha,ha... look...look at her! This makes it even more perfect!&quot; 

Sakura looked down and realized that she was only wearing the bra and 
panties that Tomoyo had made for her. She hugged herself and tried to 
cover up as Tomoyo tried to surpress a laugh. Just then, the front door 
opened and Fujitaka stepped inside. 

&quot;Hello everyone! I&#39;m back!&quot; He said as he pulled in the last of his 
luggage from outside. He turned around and saw Sakura trying to cover up 
the fact that she was almost nude. 

&quot;Gah! Sakura! What are you doing!? Why are you in your underwear!?&quot; 

&quot;Onii-chan.... I&#39;m going to kill you!&quot; She screamed as she lunged at 
him. Tomoyo thought fast and grabbed hold of Sakura&#39;s waist as she 
struggled to get free so she could give Touya the slow, agonizing death 
that he no doubtly deserved. Kero lughed and denied in having any part 
of this little stunt. 

&quot;Yeah right Kero-chan! You&#39;re probably the one that came up with this 
little prank, aren&#39;t you!?&quot; 

&quot;Calm down Sakura-chan!&quot; Tomoyo said. 

She picked up a blanket off the back of the couch and wrapped it around 
Sakura as she led her back upstairs. She was going to lead her into her 
bedroom but Sakura broke free and stomped angrily into the bathroom. She 
threw back the shower curtain and tore the large, menacing spider to 
shreds.
