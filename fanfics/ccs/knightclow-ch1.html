<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 1 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>        Yukito ate hungrily, a slight smile on his face as the light 
brown haired man demolished his massive lunch. Tomoyo had seen it 
happen a few times since she had begun to work with the good natured 
cameraman, but it still was just a bit unnerving to watch. &#39;Where does 
all of that food go?&#39; she mused, noting his rake thin form.

        &quot;Ms. Daidouji,&quot; Yukito smiled, pausing for a moment in his 
eating to say, &quot;I was wondering who this person is we&#39;ll be chasing?&quot;

        The black haired woman sighed, leaning back so that the light 
caught on her press badge. &quot;No one&#39;s entirely sure,&quot; Tomoyo said. &quot;For 
the past several months there&#39;s been sightings of a mysterious woman, 
one who seems to use real magic while fighting monsters.&quot;

        &quot;And since no one has learned anything about her you want to 
be the one to break the story,&quot; Yukito nodded thoughtfully. He hefted 
the zoom lens camera that he usually carried and vowed, &quot;I&#39;ll do my 
best to photograph her.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll go out tonight, see if we can find anything,&quot; Tomoyo 
agreed. She picked up a bag from her side and passed it over to him, 
&quot;Here.&quot;

        Yukito pulled the black clothing out of the bag and blinked, 
&quot;Why..&quot;

        &quot;If we&#39;re going to be skulking about at night,&quot; Tomoyo held up 
her own matching black shirt and pants proudly, &quot;you&#39;ve got to be 
dressed properly!&quot;

        Yukito blinked at his partner, &quot;You are a very interesting 
person, ma&#39;am.&quot;

        A smiling Tomoyo stuck her tongue out at him impishly, &quot;You&#39;re 
no fun.&quot; She picked up her notebook and stowed it away beside her 
tape- recorder as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll pick you up at your boyfriend Toya&#39;s 
place at nine, all right?&quot;

        For such a pale young man Yukito blushed quite charmingly. &quot;He 
is not my boyfriend,&quot; Yukito said with as much dignity as he could 
muster.

        &quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Tomoyo waved that off as she strode away.

        The sun shone down, the breeze ruffling her long black hair. 
She walked by a few cherry trees, the scent filling her with a kind of 
familiar peace. She loved this city, and she loved looking for all the 
secrets beneath the surface. It was part of why she had begun to play 
with a videocamera as a girl, and why she had grown up to become a 
newspaper reporter as an adult.

        &#39;And now there&#39;s a new mystery,&#39; Tomoyo thought, finishing the 
short walk from the cafe over to the newspaper offices. The Times was 
the town&#39;s main newspaper, other than a few gossip rags, and she knew 
she was lucky to be working there. &#39;Well, luck and a wee bit of 
parental influence,&#39; she mused, walking in the front door.

        &quot;Hey Daidouji,&quot; the chief&#39;s voice cut across the bullpen as 
she stuck her head out of her office to yell, &quot;get in here!&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Tomoyo sighed, walking over there. Ms. Kaho Mitsuki was 
an old fashioned reporter, someone who had worked her way up from the 
bottom, and she expected all her reporters to do the same. &quot;You wanted 
to see me?&quot; she asked brightly.

        &quot;I&#39;ve got an assignment for you,&quot; Kaho passed a folder of 
papers over, &quot;there&#39;s a new exhibit opening at the museum, I want you 
to cover it.&quot;

        Tomoyo flipped through the papers thoughtfully. An entirely 
new wing was being opened, based around a series of artifacts 
discovered by an archeologist who was based out of Tokyo itself. A 
photograph slipped from the papers, and Tomoyo scrambled to get it.

        &quot;Who is that?&quot; Tomoyo blinked at the brown haired young woman 
who smiled out of the photo. Wide green eyes, short, slightly ruffled 
brown hair, she looked.. lovely.

        &quot;Sakura Kinomoto,&quot; Kaho said crisply, &quot;she&#39;s the archeologist 
in question. I also understand that she has a position at the museum, 
possibly a assistant-curator.&quot;

        &quot;The opening is this afternoon,&quot; Tomoyo rose smoothly, 
studying the papers intently, &quot;I&#39;d better get going, then. What 
photographer is available?&quot;

        &quot;Call up Yukito,&quot; Kaho smiled slightly, &quot;I know you work well 
together.&quot;

        &quot;Got it,&quot; Tomoyo grinned suddenly, &quot;In exchange, could I look 
into the oddness that&#39;s been around the city, lately?&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re not going to let that go, are you?&quot; Kaho asked Tomoyo, 
an amused smile on her face. &quot;All right,&quot; she nodded, &quot;but don&#39;t do 
anything too stupid chasing that lady.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Tomoyo headed out with a wave. She flipped her 
cellphone open and dialed a number from memory. &quot;Yukito? It&#39;s me. 
We&#39;ve got another job, over at the museum. Meet me there by three.&quot;

        &quot;Hai,&quot; Yukito&#39;s sigh came through loud and clear.

        The two of them met in front of the museum, both of them being 
sure to be just a little bit early. Yukito checked over his precious 
camera before he gave her a curious look and asked, &quot;So when does this 
event actually start?&quot;

        &quot;At four,&quot; Tomoyo made sure that her dress was straight, the 
matching coat snug over her shoulders. &quot;And yeah, we&#39;re early so that 
we can talk to these people and try to make this a bit more than a 
puff piece,&quot; she explained fiercely.

        Yukito just nodded, being well aware of his partner&#39;s 
enthusiasm.

        The museum was quite modern, but the architecture was all 
modeled after that of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Great pillars 
rose up around them, supporting the museum roof, and the floors 
gleamed like polished glass. They were met at the door by a young man 
who checked their ID, then he lead them inside to where the exhibit 
itself was going to be.

        People rushed about, trays of food being set up and a mini-bar 
assembled in the corner. Standing out of the chaos a woman waited 
protectively by a set of displays, watching the goings-on warily. Her 
short brown hair fell messily down into those blue eyes, and her 
tasteful clothes were just a bit rumpled looking, somehow.

        &quot;Good afternoon,&quot; Tomoyo took the initiative once they were 
close enough to her, offering the woman from the photo her hand, 
&quot;you&#39;re Dr. Kinomoto, correct?&quot;

        &quot;Ah, yes,&quot; the woman blinked, &quot;Sakura, actually. Whenever 
someone says Dr. Kinomoto, I just look around for my father.&quot;

        &quot;Sakura, then,&quot; Tomoyo was just a bit surprised at how nice 
the lady&#39;s smile was, &quot;my name is Tomoyo Daidouji, I&#39;m with the 
Times.&quot;

        Sakura looked past Tomoyo&#39;s shoulder, her eyes widening 
slightly as she saw the man with the camera, &quot;Yukito? Is that you?&quot;

        &quot;Hi, Sakura,&quot; Yukito smiled back at her engagingly. At 
Tomoyo&#39;s clearly confused look the elegant photographer added, &quot;Toya 
is Sakura&#39;s big brother. I just didn&#39;t realize that it was her we were 
coming here to interview.&quot;

        &quot;Well, isn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Tomoyo smiled slightly.

        &quot;Come on,&quot; Sakura beamed as she pointed towards the display 
cases nearby, &quot;I&#39;ll give you a private tour.&quot; With a cheerful manner 
she and Tomoyo talked, Sakura explaining about her trip to China, and 
talking about the unusual artifacts she had found there. All belonging 
to a mysterious figure named Clow Reed, they were said to hold great 
mystical power.

        &quot;You don&#39;t really believe in that sort of thing, do you?&quot; 
Tomoyo asked at one point as they passed a old book, the inside 
hollow, designed to contain.. something.

        Sakura hesitated, then she smiled just slightly. &quot;I&#39;ve seen a 
few things that made me wonder,&quot; she finally admitted.

        It was only a few minutes before opening before Tomoyo finally 
put her little tape-recorder away. &quot;You do a good interview,&quot; she said 
to Sakura, &quot;thank you.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Sakura met Tomoyo&#39;s eyes, and the dark 
haired woman felt a moment of vertigo as Sakura continued warmly, &quot;it 
was my pleasure.&quot; She gave Yukito a scolding look, &quot;I hope you got 
enough photos, too.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, I guess,&quot; Yukito smiled back impishly.

        &quot;Are you going out on another expedition soon?&quot; Tomoyo asked 
Sakura curiously as she walked them towards the entrance.

        &quot;No, I plan to stick around Tokyo for awhile,&quot; Sakura said 
firmly. She gave Tomoyo a curious look, &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;

        &quot;I..&quot; Tomoyo felt a blush coming on, though she couldn&#39;t 
imagine why. &quot;I was wondering if we could do lunch or something,&quot; she 
said, &quot;your work sounds fascinating.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Sakura smiled.

        Walking down the Museum&#39;s front steps towards Tomoyo&#39;s sports 
car Yukito gave her a thoughtful look, &quot;Well, wasn&#39;t that 
interesting.&quot;

        &quot;There might be another story in it,&quot; Tomoyo said to him 
firmly, just wishing that she wasn&#39;t blushing once again.

        &quot;See you tonight,&quot; Yukito gave her a wave as they split up.

        The sun set over the city, and sitting together in the front 
seat of Tomoyo&#39;s car they patiently waited. Well, mostly patiently. 
&quot;If you don&#39;t stop clicking your camera,&quot; Tomoyo gave him a look, &quot;I&#39;m 
going to take it away from you.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Yukito put it down. He sat there for a few moment, 
fidgeting until he asked, &quot;So how are we supposed to find this mystery 
woman?&quot;

        Tomoyo reached up to tap a device on the dashboard, &quot;Police 
band radio. If one of the monsters appears, or the lady herself, we&#39;ll 
hear about it.&quot;

        &quot;Nice,&quot; Yukito put his hand on it only to jerk back in 
surprise as it squealed loudly.

        &quot;That was fast,&quot; Tomoyo nodded, listening intently. &quot;Looks 
like we&#39;ve got a hit!&quot; Tomoyo squealed out of the parking lot, the 
sleek little sports car racing across the city.

        They came around a corner, and Yukito gasped in alarm. The 
thing was big, nearly as tall as three men, and a figure wearing a 
long hooded cloak faced up against it. &quot;Where are the police?&quot; Yukito 
asked weakly.

        &quot;They usually pull back when she&#39;s around,&quot; Tomoyo said, 
climbing out of the car to take a better look at the battle.

        The cloak was red, trimmed in gold as it fluttered around the 
body beneath it. It was hard to tell gender, but a few glimpses of 
curves convinced Tomoyo it probably was a woman. Dark pants stuck out 
the bottom, and her arms were bare except for black gloves. In her 
hands the hooded figure carried a bird designed staff, almost 
reminding one of a large key.

        &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Yukito asked, clicking away with his 
camera.

        &quot;What in the..&quot; the hooded figure was distracted, seemingly by 
their presence. A backhand from the muscular, rocky skinned creature 
sent her flying away, hammering her into a wall nearby the two 
newspaper reporters.

        &quot;No,&quot; Tomoyo murmured, running over towards where the figure 
had fallen, wondering why that voice had seemed familiar. She grabbed 
an arm, pulling her up, then Tomoyo just froze. &quot;Sakura?&quot; she said 
softly.

        &quot;Hooee?&quot; Sakura blinked up at her dazedly.
