<h1>Remastered III (part 3 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster3-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&#147;Since when did you ever adopt?&#148;

Keiko was still on about what she witnessed a half an hour ago.

&#147;Don&#146;t you ever give up?&#148; Rena hisses, trying to focus on her 
reading---

&#147;No. It&#146;s my free study period class---&#148;

&#147;Only because your too lazy to teach something of any real value. 
You&#146;re an embarrassment to the Japanese educational system.&#148;

&#147;---like your actually a sterling star of education yourself, so get 
off my back---&#148; Keiko kicks back in her chair as she looks over at 
Rena, scowling abit, &#147;But since when did you become the charitable 
type? This isn&#146;t some plot to---&#148;

&#147;No. It&#146;s not. Sicko.&#148;

&#147;So what---&#148;

&#147;Damn---&#148; (Rena motions for Keiko to move closer, which she 
reluctantly does) &#147;Remember the incident with the &#147;Gentlemen&#148; a year 
ago?&#148;

&#147;Hard to forget that one, isn&#146;t it?&#148;

The Gentlemen. A group of so called &#147;noble men&#148; who had entirely 
un-noble pursuits. Formed in the 23rd Century (in the waking world), 
the group consisted of older men of power who indulged in sexual 
activities with young girls. In the waking world they are constantly 
battled against by law enforcement and the Winterian government, in 
the realm of dreams they are rivaled by the Judgements. One year ago a 
Gentleman&#146;s &#147;club&#148; was found in Tokyo and eradicated.

&#147;And her father, uncle, and two cousins happened to be members of that 
&#147;gentlemen club&#147; so I felt I had to take her in. She needed a proper 
role model.&#147;

&#147;And it helped your conscious since you butchered them without even 
putting them through the trials to see if they could have been 
rehabilitated.&#147;

At that Rena scoffs, &#147;The trials are mostly to coddle people who don&#146;t 
have the stomach for all out retribution. I don&#146;t believe they 
actually work.&#148; (leans back in her chair like Keiko as she talks) &#147;The 
only people it lets off anyway are the ones we already know are 
innocent. It never absolves the loliconers, just the small fish who 
were either forced to be a member or didn&#146;t know better. Any tripe to 
the contrary is a lot of rubbish if you ask me.&#147;

&#147;So are you teaching your &#147;precious&#148; the finer arts of &#147;love&#148;?&#148;

&#147;Go screw yourself. She has her own mind and she&#146;s perfectly happy the 
way she is.&#148;

&#147;Well? Did you teach her anything? Come on, don&#145;t tell me a self 
respecting woman like yourself can&#145;t even impress any form of her own 
morals onto this girl!&#148;

&#147;She does it for herself. What part of that is getting over that flat 
head of yours anyway?! I got her to consider both genders equally 
before picking a lover for life. There. Happy?&#148; (frowns) &#147;Your just a 
dirty old girl when your bored arentcha! Eve must have a strong 
stomach to listen to you when YOUR bored!&#148;

&#147;Well that&#146;s what you get for shocking me this early in the morning.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s past 8, sleeping beauty, what&#146;s so damn early?&#148;

&#147;Screw you.&#148;

------

Meanwhile, while the two talk---

The numbers seemed as if they were mocking her even as she tried to 
study.

It just didn&#146;t seem to want to work out the way she wanted it to.

Maybe if she--- Sakura suddenly felt a hand slip beneath her arm and 
firmly place itself between her hand and her Clow cards. &#147;No 
cheating.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan.&#148;

&#147;Your going to do fine. Just remember what you learned, and the little 
lessons I taught you about making the equations work and it&#146;ll come 
out OK in the end.&#148;

&#147;Too bad there&#146;s no time for a refresher.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t think it&#146;s an appropriate place to &#147;refresh&#148; your memory 
now--- no privacy.&#148;

&#147;I know---&#148; Sakura smiles, remembering how Tomoyo played a rather 
naughty learning game with her to help her with her math. As she 
thought about Tomoyo&#146;s antics she started to remember bits and pieces 
of the equations--- along with face flushing, red cheeked moments. 
Sakura sighs deeply, face glowing red, as she starts to work on her 
practice equations again, getting them right.

&#147;There you go. I told you you could do it if you remembered my 
lessons.&#148; (and to bring the point home, Tomoyo runs a finger up and 
down Sakura&#146;s back, treading up and down her spine sending shivers as 
she gently pushes enough so her touch could be felt through the cloth 
of the school uniform.

&#147;Tomo-chan.&#148;

&#147;Why is Sakura&#146;s face all red?&#148; (Chiharu)

------

For the first time, Meilin had brought her blade to school.

She didn&#146;t think she could, but after seeing Keiko &amp; Rena with their 
weapons (safely held in their tesseract jewels, occasionally out 
during study period for them to polish the blades) she decided to 
bring her&#146;s to class. The blade was long, yet strong and sturdy. It 
was straight as an iron bar, and fashioned after the long swords of 
European knights. The area of grip was long so she could have a firm 
grip on the blade, with her name etched into the blade in Chinese on 
one side, and a runespell that made the blade indestructible etched on 
the opposite blade side. On the blade&#146;s sheathe (propped against her 
desk) was two runes joined as one. One symbolized Meilin, the other 
Xai.

Originally, the blade&#146;s twin runes were to symbolize Meilin/Li, but 
after she finally came to the conclusion that they would never be one, 
she threw away the rune she had made for him and started a long 
standing bitter hatred of him.

She never speaks about him much, and though she knows that it was 
meant to be--- that didn&#146;t make her want to think about him anymore 
now than she wanted to when she knew that they were going to split 
into their own directions and there was nothing she could do about it.

She had done her studying with Xai so she didn&#146;t need to do it now, 
and all she could think of was Xai so she mindlessly polished the 
blade as she let her thoughts wander. The cool reflected surface 
showed her worried face, and it concerned her that she was so 
focused--- quickly she sheathed her blade again rather than stare are 
her own worried expression for another minute.

&#147;You OK?&#148;

Meilin didn&#146;t answer, she merely set the blade/sheathe against her 
broach and stored it away. Her thoughts were spinning---

----

The Shining Star

Judgement Command HQ

Xai held her paperwork firmly as she presented it, and waited for it 
to be filed.

She was happy when she realized that she could finish her paperwork a 
few days earlier than planned and join Meilin ahead of schedule. She 
couldn&#146;t contain her joy when she made the announcement to her, face 
beaming with joy as she told her the good news. She was now abit more 
somber but mostly from deep thoughts, still she&#146;d be happy again once 
she was with Meilin.

The disk she dictated all her reports on for the last few months was 
finished. Four months of solid work and information on several 
different missions, all completed. They weren&#146;t incredibly hard, or 
very difficult to complete, but they were important nevertheless.

One involved a Darkling plot to overthrown the Government of the 
Shining Star (since in about 65% of the Earths in the omniverse, Hong 
Kong (Shining Star) was a free and independent nation.)

Another involved a strange form of child porn which involved tapping 
into the memories of young Normal girls when they wandered the scape 
while they slept, using what they retrieved (the girls&#146; memories of 
bathing, or undressing, or their first sexual experimentation), and 
selling these underaged &#147;memories&#148; on a memory black market.

Yet another was a frustrated writer&#146;s strange plan to take existing 
works of fiction and &#147;patent&#148; them in dimensions where the original 
authors never did these works and take all the credit for them. For 
example, the guilty would travel to a dimension where J.K. Rowlings 
never wrote Harry Potter and release the series under the guilty&#146;s own 
name for profit purposes.

But as she left the Command Center, her reports filed and her request 
for temporary transfer granted, her thoughts were only on one thing. 
Meilin.

&#147;Got your leave?&#148;

Xai didn&#146;t need to turn to know who was speaking to her from behind. 
&#147;Of course I did. I finished my workload for the year and things are 
quiet for the time being---&#148; (turns) &#147;---figured I&#146;d take advantage of 
the slow period and take some time off out of country. Anyway, 
someone&#146;s waiting for me so we can spend Christmas together and I 
already sent our presents to each other ahead of me to Nippon.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure she&#146;ll be happy with what you got her--- you OK?&#148; he asked, 
running a hand over her head flattening out his hair, a thing he 
usually only does when he&#146;s nervous about something. &#147;Sure I&#146;m up for 
a talk---&#148; Xai announced, picking up on her male counterpart&#146;s 
nervousness. &#147;Let&#146;s grab a bite while I wait for the transport I asked 
for to pick me up for the trip to catch my flight.&#148;

-----

The older male stared at her, his black Judgement uniform seeming a 
little tight as he wiggled in his chair abit. His hair was pressed 
firm against his head, his nervous habit getting the better of him.

&#147;Usually I&#146;m the one who can&#146;t think of a word to say, but today your 
downright silent. I&#146;ll take it that isn&#146;t a good sign of things to 
come, is it?&#148;

Xai only shrugs in her own defense, a slight smirk on her face as she 
absentmindedly sips on her drink while she nibbles at her food. &#147;Your 
not yourself lately. What&#146;s up?&#148;

&#147;What makes you think something&#146;s up?&#148;

He reels back abit, as if bitten, then leans forward again motioning 
her with a come hither look to come forward abit. &#147;Other than the fact 
that Meilin is usually scolding you about wolfing down your food, only 
today you don&#146;t seem all that hungry? And the fact that your usually 
doing most of the talking but today your about as lively as an oil 
painting? Is that qualifying as a sign that something&#146;s up?&#148;

&#147;I guess---&#148; (Xai sighs as she picks up the pace a little eating wise) 
&#147;I&#146;m not being like this on purpose--- I just don&#146;t know what to say 
today. Usually you&#146;re the one with the problems, but today you seem to 
want to help me with my--- well, with me. It&#145;s like I&#145;m the one who 
needs the help today.&#148;

&#147;Maybe you do. Any problems I can pointlessly muddle through like a 
half-ass amateur?&#148;

&#147;No, not at all---&#148; (picks up pace) &#147;---and I&#145;m not just saying that 
to hide anything.&#148;

&#147;Your trying to dunk a pickle into your soda. Is that normal?&#148;

Xai stops herself, looking at her hand, her face turning into a 
sheepish smiley grin. &#147;---uh boy---&#148;

&#147;Is the wedding off?&#148;

&#147;No. No it&#146;s not off---&#148; (Xai wolfs down the pickle and sighs) 
&#147;---it&#146;s still set for April. That&#146;s not the problem--- the 
bachelorette party is on--- I even got a &#147;Filly&#148; film that&#146;ll make for 
one helluva interesting tale--- I just can&#146;t stop--- remembering.&#148;

For a second he didn&#146;t understand, but as he remembers he begins to 
frown. &#147;You know she doesn&#146;t like it when you do that. It&#146;s painful--- 
and don&#145;t you mean &#147;Stag&#147; film?&#148;

&#147;It was more painful for her than for me. And I should have---&#148;

&#147;You can&#146;t blame yourself for something that was uncon---&#148;

&#147;I should have known!&#148; (Xai slams her fist down, bringing the chatter 
to the room to a dead halt) &#147;You saw the signs, she saw the signs, the 
only one who didn&#146;t see the signs was ME! And for my ignorance in that 
everyone has the potential for good over evil? Meilin paid the price 
for my Pollyanna ways!&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s fine. Your fine. Everyone---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;M NOT FUCKING FINE!!&#148; Xai lowers her head suddenly as she realizes 
she&#146;s shouting, she goes back to drinking her drink and eating 
quietly. &#147;I don&#146;t feel fine. I feel like shit when---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not you---&#148;

&#147;It might as well have been my fault.&#148; (stops) &#147;---it&#146;s the first 
anniversary. The day we get married. She wanted it to be defiant. Say 
to the world that nothing was going to tear us apart. She&#146;s so 
strong---&#148;

&#147;Your strong too.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t feel strong.&#148; Xai laments, finishing her meal. &#147;Thanks for 
lunch. I feel better now. I have to go, my transport will be here 
soon---&#148; as she stands up to leave, he watches her walk towards the 
door, suddenly he yells out one word, &#147;Liar!&#148;, and the room falls 
silent. All eyes turn towards her as she stops, and looks back at him. 
Seconds later, with a defeated sigh, she turns back to the doorway 
out. &#147;Yeah.&#148;

It takes a whole minute for the room to go back to it&#146;s own concerns, 
leaving him sitting at the table chewing quietly and pondering---

&#147;And I mean filly.&#148; (Xai was back in the room, standing next to him)

&#147;Uh--- what&#146;s a filly film?&#148; he asked, to which she leaned down and, 
&#147;It&#146;s when a young Palominian girl goes through her coming of age 
ceremony at 20 year cycles old. She&#146;s paired up with her first love 
and they take a camera (so her family can vicariously live through her 
moment) and go into the woods to have their first sexual encounter. 
The film is saved for the bachelor and/or bachelorette party--- 
probably mostly to embarrass the hell out of the one getting married I 
suppose. You see--- I sorta had a crush on my female best friend and 
she did the ceremony with me because it was her time and we borrowed 
my auntie&#145;s toys and we wanted to emulate the Goddess Night rituals 
and it got kinda kinky and---&#148;

&#147;Alright! Alright! I get the point! Did I need that much exposition 
for a simple question?&#148; (looks at Xai with a severe expression) &#147;And 
aren&#146;t you late for your transport? Why are you here making me---&#148;

&#147;Oh, sorry. I&#145;ll--- uh---- go now---&#148; (already out the door as she 
yells her apologies).

It takes him a full minute to recover, requiring another long drink 
(and a second soda) to calm him down. &#147;Glad I&#146;m on the guest list for 
the party.&#148;

-----

Meanwhile, back in Nippon---

Sakura, head spinning from the test earlier, stops upon a strange 
sight.

Meilin was sitting beneath a tree, in her hand a glowing disc 
projecting a holographic image.

That image was of herself and the woman Sakura saw in the photo Meilin 
showed a few days earlier hugging while in a lying position in bed. 
The taller woman was leaning into Meilin, the bottom of her short--- 
?--- the word escaped Sakura&#146;s mind but it was on the tip of her 
tongue--- well, that part of her face was resting on Meilin&#146;s head and 
they both looked content in each other&#146;s arms.

Meilin, suddenly noticing Sakura, quickly snaps off the image and 
stashes the device into her bag. &#147;She&#146;s beautiful.&#148; Sakura remarks as 
she draws near. &#147;She&#146;s Palominian--- right?&#148;

&#147;Yeah--- she&#146;s the greatest.&#148; Meilin whispers, feeling a bit of angst 
for hiding what was one of their happy moments, almost as if she was 
ashamed--- she quickly retrieves the small disc and turns it on again, 
showing it to Sakura. &#147;We took this while on vacation several months 
ago. Xai bought this new hover camera and we wanted to try it out so 
we took some intimate photos--- this is---&#148; (closes imager again, 
putting it back into her bag) &#147;---the only one I can look at in 
public. The rest are--- well--- adult in nature.&#148;

&#147;I understand.&#148; Sakura smiles, sweatdropping abit as she thinks of all 
the images Tomoyo took of them that she couldn&#146;t show to anyone 
either. Quickly recovering, she motioned towards the bag. &#147;Xai&#146;s her 
name, right?&#148;

&#147;Xai Shar. Her basic family name.&#148;

&#147;Basic?&#148; Sakura asks, siting down next to Meilin (on her invitation as 
she motions for the brown haired girl to sit next to her) &#147;Palominians 
have basic and personal names. Xai already confided in me her personal 
name--- but I&#146;m not supposed to tell anyone. It&#146;s her secret family 
name.&#148;

&#147;I see---&#148; Sakura nods, fidgeting abit as she notices Meilin was 
feeling rather awkward about her talking about Xai. &#147;Are you OK? We 
could change the---&#148;

&#147;No. No. I&#146;m fine.&#148; (sighs) &#147;She finished her work early so she&#146;s 
getting transferred today so we can spend time together. I can&#146;t wait 
to see her. I know it&#146;s only been a few days since we were last--- 
well, together--- and the holosuite projector is great but--- I miss 
being with her in a truly physical sense.&#148;

Sakura nods her head, having experienced the same feelings when Tomoyo 
was on a business trip for her slowly growing Anime company. &#147;It&#146;s 
hard when the one you love is so far away, even for a little while--- 
isn&#146;t it?&#148;

&#147;Yeah. Yeah--- that&#146;s it exactly---&#148; Meilin leans back, watching the 
clouds roll by--- only to notice Sakura staring at her intently. 
&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;You seem so mature. I mean, well I mean that I&#146;m not implying you 
weren&#146;t mature before! I mean---&#148; (Sakura looked nervous as if she 
said something wrong) &#147;It&#146;s alright. I guess the first time we met I 
was abit of a child, becoming so jealous and then taking that jealousy 
out on you all the time.&#148; (sighs) &#147;But I guess after I met Xai and 
then--- well, I grew up a lot since then. I&#146;m a changed woman now.&#148;

&#147;I miss the old Meilin.&#148;

&#147;Eh? Why?&#148;

&#147;You were always on my back--- but you were also so very energetic. 
When you came back I thought it was the old Meilin but--- it&#146;s as if 
you&#146;ve grown and some of that energy is gone.&#148;

&#147;It happens when---&#148; (stops herself) &#147;When what?&#148; Sakura prodded. For 
the longest time she didn&#146;t speak, until finally she frowned and 
tagged Sakura on the shoulder with a slight punch, &#147;Nothing! Don&#146;t get 
all mushy with me! It&#146;s disgusting!&#148;

Sakura smiles, nodding her head. &#147;There&#146;s the spunk I remember.&#148;

&#147;Well don&#146;t get used to it. I like being mature. Just because I don&#146;t 
ride on your back like SOME people I know, it doesn&#146;t mean I&#146;m not 
going to be hard on you tonight when we go after Fight! You better be 
ready Kinomoto, because I don&#146;t want you slacking when we capture 
Fight!&#148;

&#147;I promise I&#146;ll be ready.&#148;

&#147;Good!&#148; (picks up her stuff) &#147;I have to get ready, Xai&#146;s flight is 
coming soon. I&#146;ll see you tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;Right---&#148; (watches Meilin walk off) &#147;---bye.&#148; (leans against the tree 
that Meilin was leaning against earlier, watching the fluffy white 
clouds lazily roll by in the sky) &#147;What did she mean---&#148;

&#147;Mean by what?&#148;

&#147;ACk!&#148; Sakura nearly jumps out of her skin, jumping forward in shock. 
&#147;You scared me!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry!&#148; Tomoyo apologies, sitting next to Sakura, &#147;I didn&#146;t mean 
to scare you. What&#146;s wrong though? You seemed so deep in thought I 
almost didn&#146;t want to disturb you. (But I know your hungry so I bought 
lunch).&#148;

&#147;Thank you!&#148; (starts eating as Tomoyo sits patiently nearby, waiting 
for an answer as she starts to eat her own lunch) &#147;So? What were you 
so deep in thought about?&#148;

&#147;Meilin. Does she seem more mature these days?&#148;

&#147;Growing up tends to do that to you. Even you&#146;ve matured and become 
more adult-like in the past few years!&#148;

&#147;Me? An adult?&#148; Sakura smirks at the thought, &#147;I don&#146;t feel very 
mature. Sometimes I feel like I&#146;m not growing very much while your 
blossoming into womanhood---&#148;

&#147;Your blossoming too.&#148; (leans on Sakura&#146;s shoulder) &#147;You don&#146;t know 
how lucky I am to be able to watch my precious Sakura blossom into 
womanhood, and be there with her so we can both reach that point of 
our lives together. It&#146;s something I thought could never happen to a 
girl like me.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m glad we could be together--- forever---&#148;

&#147;Forever---&#148; The two stop, and watch the clouds, letting the moment 
sink in. As they watch, Tomoyo reaches out and takes one of Sakura&#146;s 
hands, holding it tight as she wraps her other arm around Sakura&#146;s 
waist, drawing her close. &#147;I&#146;m the luckiest girl in the world to be in 
love with you.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m lucky that we could be so close--- and that you love me as well.&#148;

Moments pass, and Sakura&#146;s stomach growls. &#147;---&#148;

&#147;Back to eating?&#148; Tomoyo chides gently, passing Sakura her food and 
playfully feeding her a bite by hand, pushing the morsel into her 
mouth and savoring her lip&#146;s touch on her fingers. &#147;Have to keep my 
brave Card Captor&#146;s strength up. Tonight?&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s get Fight tonight then.&#148;

The two go back to eating, occasionally bringing a bite of their food 
to the other&#146;s mouth to playfully feed each other.

Neko Industrial Park

Formerly the location of King Penguin Park

Nighttime

Nina was fussy and not in a talkative mood with Sakura--- until she 
saw Sakura&#146;s new costume.

&#147;---santa&#146;s naughty elf came early this year---&#148; Nina whispered, 
suppressing the urge to laugh.

Sakura was decked in fur from head to foot--- mostly. She wore a red 
outfit with white trim, a short red skirt with white fur frills, 
sleeveless top (again with the same white fur frills on her collar and 
so forth, long red gloves and hip hugging boots, and to top it off she 
wore a little red santa cap.

&#147;Santa&#146;s naughty elves&#146; going to have it out? Sounds like a que&#145; kinky 
Spice Channel pay-per-view event if you ask me.&#148; Keiko remarking, 
looking Sakura up and down as she did. Sakura was blushing quite 
visibly, but Tomoyo was pleased with her new design. &#147;I decided since 
Fight was going with a Christmas theme this year I&#146;d match it with a 
Christmas theme for Sakura-chan.&#148;

&#147;---Tomo-chan---&#148; Sakura sweatdropped, feeling a little awkward in her 
costume.

&#147;Well I for one am pleased with how it turned out.&#148;

&#147;Me too, Tomoyo!&#148; Nina chipped in. &#147;She&#146;s just the CWUTIEIEST WITTLE 
WHELF!!&#148;

(Nina was now thoroughly enjoying herself at Sakura&#146;s expense!)

&#147;I didn&#146;t know Fight could change her appearance.&#148; Eliza thought out 
loud. &#147;Why the sudden change of clothes, and why a Christmas motif?&#148;

&#147;I dunno.&#148; (Kero) &#147;Fight never changed her clothes for anything--- and 
thank god her clothes was magically maintained and cleaned between 
changes from card to human or she&#146;d had been impossible to be around! 
She&#146;s kinda stuck on her old clothes--- so I can&#146;t figure out why she 
changed--- clothes that is.&#148;

&#147;Maybe she&#146;s finally getting into the holiday spirit?&#148; Sakura put out, 
tugging abit on her skirt.

&#147;Nah. Fight&#146;s the kind of girl who&#146;d give Scrooge nightmares. She&#146;s 
not into any holidays, just fighting and beating up people to test 
herself often, and that kinda makes her a bit of a killjoy during 
holidays like Christmas. Still, why the change---&#148;

Suddenly Sakura snaps her head about, her attention focused. &#147;I sense 
something nearby--- something close---&#148;

&#147;Is it Fight?&#148; Tomoyo asked, her camera trained on Sakura as she 
raised her staff and closed her eyes to focus--- &#147;Feels like it. But I 
have to get closer--- this way!&#148; Before anyone can react she&#146;s already 
in motion, moving fast with Tomoyo behind her followed by the others.

&#147;Wait up!&#148; Nina gasped, lagging behind as everyone chased after 
Sakura, &#147;It&#146;s too close to Christmas for me to run like this! Shopping 
takes it out of me every year and my stamina&#146;s screwed!&#148;

As they all round the corner they run right into Sakura--- staring 
awkwardly as a young couple walking in the park. The female, who had a 
passing resemblance to Fight, wore a long overcoat to keep warm as she 
cuddled next to her young man. She looked at Sakura strangely, and 
said &#147;W-wh-what&#146;s wrong? Why are you staring at m-me?&#148;

After a quick apology, Sakura ran on with the others following. &#147;False 
alarm!&#148; Sakura gasped, as she suddenly comes to a dead halt--- &#147;I 
don&#146;t get it. I feel Fight now--- but the feeling is behind us now---&#148;

&#147;Where that young couple is?&#148; Tomoyo asked, pulling Sakura up so she 
could lean on Tomoyo to catch her breath. &#147;It wasn&#146;t them though, was 
it?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know---&#148;

&#147;Can&#146;t be. Fight is never the talkative type, and she&#146;s about as warm 
and cuddly as a sharp object, while that young woman seemed very warm 
to that guy. Can&#146;t imagine Fight being that cuddly to anyone.&#148;

&#147;Why not?&#148; Eve asks with a questioning glance towards Kero, &#147;She could 
fall in love.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s too obsessed with fighting to do anything. She can&#146;t enjoy the 
holidays, she&#146;s a dreadful cloud over everyone else&#146;s enjoyment, and 
she&#146;s not the most sociable card I ever spent time with. She&#146;s just a 
total killjoy, I don&#146;t see how that loving young woman could be our 
Fight.&#148;

&#147;Anyway, is someone going to magically appear behind us or---&#148;

&#147;Nope.&#148;

Everyone turns, coming face to face with Rena. &#147;I don&#146;t think Meilin&#146;s 
coming.&#148;

&#147;She came last time when Fight was around--- maybe she went to New 
King Penguin Park?&#148; Sakura pondered, to which Rena only shook her 
head. &#147;I think she&#146;d rather be with her pony-girl than here.&#148;

&#147;Or we could have just stopped at the hotel and hurried over.&#148;

The new voice was deeper, stronger. As they all turned to the new 
voice they saw Meilin, walking side by side with a tall Palominian 
woman (dressed in the black uniform of the Judgements) come towards 
them. Meilin wore black also, but it was adorned with little things 
that reminded Sakura so much of Meilin&#146;s old costume. Nina sighed, 
&#145;Thank god she changed clothes! If her costume was as kinky as the 
Anime made it look she&#146;d be an embarrassment to work with--- walking 
panty shot all the way.&#146;

Xai turns her attention squarely on Sakura, &#147;Sakura, isn&#146;t it?&#147; (she 
nods her head) &#147;Is she here?&#148;

&#147;I sensed something before, but it wasn&#146;t her.&#148;

&#147;Let me be the judge of that.&#148; Xai turns, raises her head, and sniffs 
the air abit. As she paces in a tight circle she continues to sniff 
the air as if looking for a scent.

&#147;I thought you were marrying a pony, not a dog, Meilin---&#148; (Xai turns 
and glares at Rena, silencing her) &#147;It&#146;s a simple Palominian trait. I 
have a very good sense of smell, even to an extent into the mystical 
range of smells.&#148;

&#147;Can you smell Fight&#146;s scent?&#148; (Kerberos) &#147;She doesn&#146;t bathe too often 
so I figure she must have some scent!&#148;

&#147;I mean her power. It gives off an electrical scent. The kind you 
smell when the air&#145;s filled with static electricity.&#148; Xai shakes her 
head. &#147;More like there&#146;s two scents. One human covering over the 
electrical energy--- did you see any coup---?&#148; (they were already 
running, leaving the two behind) &#147;Hey!&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t run away without us! Hey!!&#148; (Meilin frowns, stomping her foot) 
&#147;I hate it when she does that!&#148; Quickly she goes into a dead sprint, 
with Xai close behind. &#147;She&#146;s always running off and not thinking 
things through! Hard headed! I thought she grew out of it!&#148;

&#147;Maybe she needs more time!&#148; Xai remarked, her pace steady and neck to 
neck with Meilin&#146;s.

-----

Sakura reached Fight first, grabbing her arm and spinning her around. 
The male she was with was shocked, but tried to get between the two. 
Sakura, however, still charged from the run, swung her arm out 
expecting an attack from Fight. Big mistake. Her staff strikes the 
male in the head knocking him over.

For long seconds nothing, both stand there in shock. Everything 
happened so fast that neither had a chance to recover from the 
quickness of the confrontation. Fight shakes suddenly, and from her 
twisting lips her voice brings forth a horrified shriek. Quickly 
Sakura braces herself, steadying herself for an attack--- that doesn&#146;t 
happen. Fight drops to her knees, scooping him into her arms crying. 
As Nina &amp; Eliza check on him, Fight kneels there with him in her arms 
shivering and crying.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry---&#148; Sakura whispers, kneeling down, &#147;I&#146;m sorry! I 
didn&#146;t---&#148;

Fight wouldn&#146;t stop shaking, she didn&#146;t want to look at Sakura 
though--- she only wanted her to go away. &#147;Fight, I&#146;m sorry! I didn&#146;t 
mean to---&#148;

Fight gently puts him into Eliza&#146;s care, looking at Sakura, her eyes 
teary as she stands.

Her fists clench and unclench, her breath ragged, her stance strong 
but waivering.

She closes her eyes and raises her head as if looking into the night 
sky--- then she speaks.

-----

All she ever knew was how to fight.

Violence was an artform to her. She could speak, but never wanted to. 
She only wanted to fight.

One night she ran into someone she couldn&#146;t beat--- and he wasn&#146;t 
going to let her off with only a warning. He and a couple of his 
friends were her targets. They played dirty and brought her down hard, 
using devices that shot out wire that clipped into her, and sent 
thousands of volts of electricity through her body. She was too numb 
to feel anything, but not numb enough in her senses to know when they 
dragged her into the brush and raped her.

That&#146;s when he came. He was jogging and came to her rescue. She 
watched, while one of her captors held her nude body, as he took a 
harsh beating and was dropped next to her to watch.

She couldn&#146;t bear to look, but she had to--- and he was still only 
concerned for her. He fought for her. Not for the love of fighting, or 
the desire to find worthy opponents to beat--- but he wanted to come 
to her aid. Be her--- what was it? Knight in shining armor? She 
thought the notion of such a thing was an absurd thing. Whenever Kero 
and the others would watch a story about brave male knights saving 
hapless females thanks to the Toon card&#146;s shows, she would storm off 
in a huff. The idea of women needing me to save them was absurd. She 
didn&#146;t need anyone--- until then. When she saw how much he suffered 
for her, and still only cared about her safety--- she knew she found 
something better than fighting---

-----

&#147;I can help!&#148; Sakura brings Fight&#146;s attention back to the real world, 
holding out her staff. &#147;I&#146;m glad you found someone to be happy with. I 
don&#146;t want you to lose that. Here. Let me help you.&#148;

Sakura raises the staff upwards, holding it tight. &#147;Clow Card give 
your power unto me--- and be---&#148;

A flash of light obscures Sakura&#146;s vision and then nothing. The impact 
slams into her hard, sending her flying across the grass to land under 
a tree, blood flowing from her nose.

&#147;SAKURA!!!&#148; Tomoyo screams, quickly rushing over to where she laid, 
picking her up gingerly in her arms. As she turns to stare as Fight, 
the two notice she was the one who landed the blow.

Fight, teeth clenched, lowered her hand, slightly bloodied by the 
impact, and frowns.

She wasn&#146;t done with her story yet.

------

As they turned her over on her back, holding her down, they turned her 
head towards her savior.

So she could watch as one of her assailants flipped him over, and 
violated him.

He was the first one to rape her, so she couldn&#146;t believe what he was 
doing--- let alone how much sadistic pleasure he took in hitting him 
and--- goddess, it shook Fight to the core of her being. She&#146;s done a 
great many things to her opponents, but she&#146;s never been so--- evil to 
them when they were down. This, this affront was unforgivable. What 
they did to her she could understand. They were only males, that she 
could grasp (them doing it to her) but to him? The thought disgusted 
her.

In front of her shocked, disbelieving eyes she watched this--- and it 
sank into her mind. They were nothing more than animals. Horrid, 
vicious animals that walked upright like men. And that sickened her 
and made her very very angry. She wanted to do horrible things to 
them. Things only she could do.

It took her time to heal from her wounds, but she could crawl to 
him--- take him home--- and they would heal together--- but when she 
healed she came back for them--- the first one she found assaulting a 
young girl the same age as Mistress Sakura when she was first sealed 
by her.

Her rage boiled over, and Fight did more than &#147;fight&#148; him--- she 
obliterated him.

How different, she once mused, than how she treated her savior.

Her hands, which could break bone and flesh, were gentle as the 
caressing touch of a light breeze against her lover&#146;s body--- her 
limbs which could deliver steel hard blows, now soothed and comforted.

Her body which could withstand the most concentrated attacks, melted 
like butter to his touch as she made love to him--- and each 
confirming to the other that they were still whole entities, if not 
both human than at least whole enough to survive the worst man can do 
and come out intact, or close to that.

But the man beneath her was not her lover. She saved her gentlest 
smiles, comforting touch, and her love for him. This thing beneath 
her, this animal--- he meant nothing to her.

Her rage and anger made her murderous in her rage, and she utterly 
destroyed him to the point of it being near barbarous what she did to 
him. But she wasn&#146;t done. She wanted them all--- and she nearly had 
them--- except for the man who first raped her--- then violated the 
man she calls her darling beloved. She wanted to kill him. Beat him. 
For her lover. For herself. For everyone who suffered because of him.

And for that she needed her power--- and wasn&#146;t going to give it up 
easily.

-----

Fight steps back slowly watching for any movements, until she reached 
him, and picked him up. Before anyone could move she was off, running 
like crazy to get away. But right now everyone was more focused on 
Sakura than Fight--- but still--- as Tomoyo tended to Sakura, tears 
flowing down her face as she fussed and cared for her beloved? Well, 
when they left that night to capture Fight they all knew that it 
wasn&#146;t going to be easy--- the situation had only gotten a lot more 
complicated.

And they didn&#146;t like that one bit.
