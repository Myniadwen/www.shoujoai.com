<h1>Discovering Beauty (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jbrown.html">James Brown</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/discbeaut-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>As the birds chirped and flew through the sky, a calm breeze from the 
late morning air passed through the trees.  The sun projected its rays 
of light upon Sakura&#39;s face as she gazed up at it.  The two girls had 
agreed the previous night to meet by the penguin slide at the park.  
The brown haired girl felt so joyful as she was about to meet the one 
she had fallen in love with.  She took her time as she walked to her 
destination, causing her heart to swell with anticipation.  Her choice 
of speed felt natural in this situation for the fact that if she went 
too fast to see Tomoyo, she would be unable to savor the time it would 
take to get there.  Sakura envisioned her meeting with her best 
friend, telling her how much she loved her and especially seeing her 
smile again.  Sakura had missed Tomoyo&#39;s smile so much that seeing it 
would grant her an unexplainable amount of happiness. Each step 
brought her closer to that feeling of happiness.  As the penguin slide 
came into full view, Sakura stopped walking and quickly noticed that 
Tomoyo was not in her vantage point.  Once she began to walk around 
the slide counterclockwise, she found the dark haired girl waiting for 
her.  At first, Sakura began to advance toward her, but halted once 
she saw her face.  With her head hung low, Tomoyo had a somewhat 
dismal look on her face which indicated that she still had sadness 
within her heart.  &#39;I wonder, could she still be thinking of how I 
left her all alone the other day?&#39; Sakura thought to herself.  &#39;I 
suppose that could be it.  She did sound a little uncomfortable about 
coming when I spoke to her last night. I&#39;m starting to feel like I 
forced her to come.  I can&#39;t see her like this.  It wouldn&#39;t work.  
Even if I did tell her, she might feel nervous if she thinks I&#39;m going 
to hurt her again.  I need to lighten the mood and make her feel at 
ease.  But how can I do that?&#39;  Sakura began to think as to what she 
could do.  For a while she was stumped for an idea and wasn&#39;t sure if 
she could come up with anything.  But she kept cool and didn&#39;t rush in 
her thinking process.  After a few minutes, she finally came up with 
an idea.  Once it came to her, she was positive that it would help in 
her situation.  She smiled as she dashed in the direction opposite the 
slide, putting her plan into motion.

------------------------------------------------------------

Nervousness was what Tomoyo was feeling.  Nervousness mixed in with 
fear. She was fearful because she didn&#39;t know what would happen to 
her.  This feeling of fear was with her since the phone call last 
night.  Hearing Sakura&#39;s voice through the earpiece came as a surprise 
to her and she could hardly believe that the girl would even contact 
her.  The phone conversation had hardly begun when Sakura asked to 
meet with her.  Tomoyo wasn&#39;t pressured in any way to see Sakura, but 
the moments when the two last saw each other came back into the dark 
haired girl&#39;s mind.  She didn&#39;t know what Sakura would do if she went, 
she couldn&#39;t even find any logic in going back to the person who hurt 
her so much.  All she knew was that she needed to see the person she 
fell in love with.  That, beyond anything else, was all that mattered 
in Tomoyo&#39;s mind.  Afrter agreeing to meet with Sakura, the 
nervousness quickly rushed in and overtook her senses.  What Sakura 
would say to her was beyond her grasp.  Would she apologize, or would 
she make Tomoyo feel bad about herself?  This thought put the greatest 
amount of fear into her.  If Sakura rejected her, she would have her 
feelings and opinions rejected.  Tomoyo&#39;s opinions made up who she 
was, they were what made her human.  If her opinions were rejected, 
then her right to be human was rejected.  Tomoyo would not be able to 
handle hearing it.  As Tomoyo patiently sat by the slide awaiting her 
confrontation with Sakura, she held on to the stuffed elephant that 
was meant to be Sakura&#39;s gift.  Tomoyo had brought it along hoping 
that the brown haired girl would be more understanding and would want 
to accept it.  Tomoyo clutched the elephant to her chest recalling the 
moment when she had presented it to her friend.  In that brief instant 
of time, the two girls both shared a moment of happiness toghther.  
The elephant was used by Tomoyo in order to bring out no only Sakura&#39;s 
happiness, it brought out her warmth and youthful charm as well.  
Tomoyo would have given anything if she could see Sakura in a joyful 
mood once again.  But something within Tomoyo, a feeling deep within 
her heart, was telling her that things would not be as she had hoped.  
Everything she planned, everyhing she dreamed about could be gone in 
an instant.  She wanted everything to turn out right for her.  She 
just needed something to tell her that she could end the day feeling 
happy, that there was no reason to be afraid, that the love she hoped 
for would be there.

------------------------------------------------------------

Tomoyo continued to clutch onto the elephant when a gentle gust of 
wind blew past her.  The cool air brushed onto her face and gave her a 
slight chill.  This feeling distracted Tomoyo for a brief moment 
before she went back to her previous train of thought.  She was 
distracted once again when she noticed something descend from the sky 
and land beside her right leg. It was a leaf from a cheery blossom.  
Tomoyo was very surprised to see one because it wasn&#39;t the right time 
for them to come out and none of the trees close to Tomoyo had any 
cheery blossoms on them.  She raised her head and noticed that more 
chery blossom petals were falling to the ground, almost like a pink 
snow shower.  The question of how this occurrence could be possible 
entered the girl&#39;s mind as she raised her head higher.  The sight she 
witnessed overwhelmed her system as amazement caused her to smile. 
Hundreds of cheery blossom petals were drifting high up above Tomoyo, 
flowing like a river, and fell around where she sat.  The sight of 
beauty caused Tomoyo to stand up and greet it with her smile.  As more 
of the petals fell to the Earth, Tomoyo held out her hand and caught a 
few in her palm.  She picked up one of the petals with her left thumb 
and finger and began to examine it up close.  Tomoyo knew that the 
occurrence above her could not be considered possible by any normal 
means of reasoning.  The petals that Tomoyo collected felt as real as 
any other cheery blossom petal she ever held, but these petals felt 
very different.  Within them she felt a bright source of energy that 
resonated through her body, making her feel like she was floating on 
air.  Tomoyo closed her eyes and let the sensations run around and 
take over.  Her realization as to how his phenomenon could happen came 
to her as the feelings of pleasure continued to flow.  Once she knew 
the casue of this event, she became even happier.
