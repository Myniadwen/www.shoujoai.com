<h1>The Dream</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/overstreet.html">Clayton Overstreet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sakura looked around suspiciously. The fact that she couldn&#39;t see three
feet in front of her nose was irrelevant. The mist was everywhere.
Suddenly she called out a card and tossed it in front of her. &quot;Windy!
Blow away the mist so I can see it&#39;s visible form.&quot; The card glowed and
suddenly Windy sped out, taking the mist with her. Sakura smiled as
she saw a small cloud. &quot;Mist, return to your power confined. &quot;Mist!&quot;
She swung the wand and the Mist card and Windy returned to card form,
then floated to her hand. Sakura smiled and put them away with the
others.

Madison and Kero came running up behind her. &quot;Way to go Sakura!&quot; Kero
yelled.

Madison focused her camera on Sakura&#39;s face and smiled. &quot;I agree. And
you look great.&quot;

Sakura blushed and looked down at her costume. Madison was always
making them for her. &quot;Well I wouldn&#39;t look so great if it weren&#39;t for
you Madison.&quot;

Madison blushed slightly. &quot;Thanks Sakura.&quot;

Suddenly Lee and Maylin were there too. Maylin looked down at Sakura
and snorted. &quot;Lee could have done it better.&quot; Sakura looked at Madison
and they both rolled their eyes.

Lee stepped forward. &quot;Good capture Sakura.&quot; Sakura blushed and Maylin
made a nasty comment under her breath. Sakura also noticed Madison
blanch slightly.

&quot;Are you alright Madison?&quot; Sakura asked looking at her nervously.

Madison smiled same as always, &quot;I&#39;m fine Sakura.&quot; The words sounded
like they always did, but something seemed wrong. Oh well, if something
were bothering Madison she would tell Sakura. She was her best friend
after all.

Meanwhile Kero had perched on Sakura&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Well I have to say
Sakura is getting way better at capturing cards.&quot;

Maylin walked up and looked into Kero&#39;s eyes. &quot;What do you know? You&#39;re
just a stuffed animal!&quot; They continued fighting like that for several
minutes, until Sakura got fed up.

&quot;Stop fighting right now you two or I&#39;ll have the change card switch
your bodies like it did with Lee!&quot; Sakura said. The two of them
immediately quieted down, though they both stuck their tongues out at
each other again. Sakura sighed and glanced at Madison who giggled
back. &quot;Some times this seems like more trouble than it&#39;s worth.&quot;

Madison smiled at her and shook her head. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t do that Sakura.
You are too good a person to leave the card running around like that.&quot;

Maylin shook her head, &quot;You could always just let Lee do it.&quot; She
stopped and looked at Madison. &quot;And why are you always complimenting
Sakura like that anyway?&quot;

Madison blushed and stammered, &quot;Because she&#39;s my friend...&quot; Sakura
smiled and put her arm around Madison&#39;s shoulders. &quot;That&#39;s right, best
friends.&quot;

Maylin shrugged and looked at Lee. &quot;You could probably do it better
than she could right Lee? You are so good at everything.&quot; Lee frowned
and turned to walk away without saying a word. Maylin ran after him
leaving Kero, Madison and Sakura alone.

Madison turned and smiled at Sakura. Sakura smiled back. &quot;Hey, want to
have a sleep over at my house?&quot;

Madison&#39;s eyes sparkled slightly. &quot;Yeah, that would be great Sakura.
And we could watch my video of your last card capture.&quot;

Kero meanwhile tugged on Sakura&#39;s ear. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t forget we still need
to eat dinner. I&#39;m starving.&quot; The two girls laughed as Kero&#39;s stomach
growled. Sakura summoned the fly card and Madison got on the wand
behind her.

&quot;Hold on tight Madison.&quot; Madison wrapped her arms around Sakura&#39;s waist
and held on.

Once they were high into the air she looked down and smiled. &quot;You know
Sakura, I can&#39;t picture a better moment than this.&quot; She hugged Sakura a
bit.

Sakura nodded in return. &quot;I know what you mean. It&#39;s a great view from
up here.&quot;

Madison nodded and bit her lip. &quot;Especially here with you Sakura.&quot;
Sakura smiled and turned back to her. Madison smiled at her and Sakura
giggled. &quot;Well as long as we&#39;re friends we can always do this any time.
Especially after I catch all the cards.&quot;

Madison smiled, then leaned in to get a better grip. &quot;I&#39;d like that
Sakura... I really would.&quot;

When they arrived home Sakura turned the wand back into the key and
opened the door. Tory was sitting in the living room. &quot;Hello squirt.
What&#39;s with the get up?&quot;

Sakura looked down at the silvery costume she was wearing. &quot;Oh, Madison
made it for me.&quot; Madison came in the door behind her and blushed a bit.

Tory just shook his head. &quot;Well anyway, dad is working late tonight and
I&#39;m going to a movie. You two will be on your own tonight.&quot;

Madison looked at Sakura, &quot;Can I use your phone to tell my mother where
I am? She gets worried if I don&#39;t check in every now and then.&quot; Sakura
nodded and Madison ran to make her call. Tory walked out and Sakura
headed upstairs to change her clothes and let Kero in. When she came
down Madison was in the kitchen making some soup.

&quot;You took off the costume?&quot; Madison asked.

Sakura blushed, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to get any food on it.&quot; Madison smiled
and nodded.

While they were eating Kero came flying downstairs to get some soup of
his own. While they were eating Sakura looked over at Madison. &quot;So why
do you keep video taping me and making all those great costumes? It
must be a lot of work Madison.&quot;

Madison smiled and shrugged. &quot;I like to do it Sakura. It makes me feel
good when you wear one of the costumes I make. You look terrific in
them.&quot; Sakura blushed and took another sip of her soup.

&quot;Well then thank you Madison. I really appreciate it.&quot; Sakura said.

Madison blushed and looked down. &quot;You have no idea how good it is to
hear you say that Sakura. Your opinion means a lot to me.&quot;

Sakura smiled and put her hand on Madison&#39;s. &quot;You are my best friend
Madison. Are you sure you are alright? You look worried about
something.&quot;

Madison took her hand back and smiled. &quot;No, I&#39;m fine.&quot; She smiled and
looked up at Sakura. Sakura looked back and noticed something in
Madison&#39;s face. She seemed like she was having trouble keeping the
smile there.

Sakura had seen that look before. &quot;Madison could you please at least
promise that if anything is bothering you, you&#39;ll tell me?&quot;

Madison bit her lip and looked away. &quot;Um... hey, we haven&#39;t watched the
video yet.&quot; She grabbed her camera and ran into the living room before
Sakura could say anything. Sakura looked at Kero who looked back and
shrugged. They both got up and walked after Madison. When they got to
the living room Madison had already slipped the tape into the VCR.
Sakura and Kero at on the couch while Madison grabbed the remote
control and plopped down next to them.

Once the video go going Sakura got so caught up in it that she tuned
everything else out. Madison had a night vision attachment so it could
see through the fog and darkness. Sakura watched amazed at herself.
Meanwhile next to her on the couch Madison was watching Sakura&#39;s face.
&quot;Wow Madison, that costume looks really good.&quot;

Madison nodded and smiled. &quot;You look beautiful Sakura.&quot; Sakura didn&#39;t
actually seem to hear her, since she was still watching the movie. Kero
on the other hand had noticed that when she said that Madison&#39;s eyes
had been nowhere near the television. He shook his head and turned back
to the screen.

After the movie was over Sakura turned to Madison. &quot;You always get the
best shots. Even before I found out about the Clow Cards. How do you do
that?&quot;

Madison blushed and got up to put the video away before somebody else
saw it. &quot;Oh you know, it just depends on what I&#39;m shooting.&quot;

Sakura giggled, &quot;Well I&#39;m like the only thing you ever take pictures
of.&quot;

Madison smiled again and looked confused. &quot;Are you? I guess I really
didn&#39;t notice.&quot; She picked up the camera and yawned. &quot;I think I&#39;d like
to go to bed.&quot; Sakura looked at her strangely.

&quot;Well, alright. Maybe tomorrow we can go to the park and hang out. For
now though I&#39;ll put our dinner dishes away alright?&quot;

Madison looked at her, &quot;Do you need any help?&quot;

Sakura shook her head. &quot;Nah. Besides it will give you a chance to get
ready for bed without me being in the way.&quot;

Madison smiled and shook her head. &quot;Thank you Sakura, but you have
never been in my way.&quot; Sakura smiled and Madison ran up the stairs.

Once she was gone Sakura headed for the kitchen. &quot;So Kero, is it just
me or do you think something is bothering Madison?&quot;

Kero flew behind her as she loaded the dishes. &quot;I don&#39;t know for sure
Sakura. But yeah I think so.&quot; He twitched his tail slightly.

Sakura looked at him. &quot;What do you think it could be?&quot; Kero bit his lip
and shrugged. This was one of those things Sakura would have to figure
out on her own.

&quot;Maybe you could use a Clow Card to find out?&quot; Kero said.

Sakura looked at him shocked. &quot;Kero! I am surprised at you. She&#39;s my
best friend. If she doesn&#39;t want to tell me it&#39;s her business.&quot; Sakura
stopped and sighed. &quot;I just wish she&#39;d trust me more is all.&quot;

From her spot at the top of the stairs Madison let out a tiny sob. She
wished she could tell Sakura. Wished that Sakura would understand. But
it would never happen. Madison considered herself lucky to be Sakura&#39;s
friend, even if it hurt to be so near her sometimes. But if Sakura
found out how Madison really felt about her... well then she might not
even have that any more.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll sleep down here tonight Sakura. I read in the TV Guide
that there was a anime marathon on tonight.&quot; Kero said.

Sakura nodded and turned to walk up the stairs. &quot;Good night Kero.&quot;

Wiping the tears off her face Madison turned and ran into Sakura&#39;s
room. It wouldn&#39;t do for Sakura to see her crying. If Sakura got sad it
always hurt Madison. Once she was in the room she quietly closed the
door and sat back on the bed. Next to her on the night stand was a
picture of her and Sakura together. She had an identical one at home
next to her bed. While she was looking at it Madison frowned again.
Maybe she should tell Sakura. If she felt like Madison didn&#39;t trust her
maybe it wasn&#39;t worth it to keep it from her. And if Sakura never
wanted to see her again or was afraid of her... well that was something
she would just have to live with. &quot;That&#39;s right, the second she comes
through that door I&#39;ll tell her.&quot;

Sakura came through the door at that moment and smiled at her. &quot;Tell me
what Madison?&quot;

Madison blushed and her words caught in her throat. Ok, so much for
that idea. &quot;Um... I was just going to tell you... that I designed a new
costume for you.&quot;

Sakura smiled. &quot;Really? You&#39;ll have to tell me about it.&quot; She ducked
into the closet to change and so Madison didn&#39;t see the look on her
face. It was obvious that Madison had not meant a costume when she had
said that. And it hurt Sakura a lot that her friend wouldn&#39;t tell her
what she had really meant.

Meanwhile Madison was doing her best to sound cheerful and describe one
of the new costumes she had been working on. After Sakura came out
Madison smiled at her. &quot;So... what do you think about Lee? Think you
and he might get together?&quot;

Sakura smiled. So that was it. Madison had a thing for Lee and was
afraid that Sakura liked him. &quot;No, he&#39;s not really my type. If you want
him go right ahead.&quot; For some reason though she couldn&#39;t quite picture
Madison and Lee together though. And when she tried it actually seemed
to hurt a bit. Quickly she looked around at Madison who looked back at
her in shock.

&quot;Me like Lee? You must be kidding Sakura.&quot; Madison laughed.

Sakura looked at her angrily. &quot;Well then what is it? You&#39;ve been hiding
something from me all night. It&#39;s like you don&#39;t trust me or
something.&quot; Sakura turned and sat down in the chair at her desk, facing
away from Madison. Suddenly from behind her she heard a slight intake
of breath. When she turned around Madison was crying heavily and looking
right at her.

&quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry Madison.&quot; Sakura quickly ran over and hugged her friend.
Madison hugged her back, but still kept crying. &quot;It&#39;s alright if you
don&#39;t want to tell me.&quot;

Madison sobbed again and said, &quot;But... but I want to tell you. I&#39;m just
kind of scared that if I do you wont like me any more.&quot;

Sakura turned and smiled at her. &quot;Madison, there is nothing you could
possibly say that would make me not like you. You&#39;re my best friend.&quot;
Madison looked at her still uncertain. Sakura smiled and sat down.
&quot;Suppose I guess, do you think that would be alright?&quot; Madison bit her
lip, but couldn&#39;t hide the smile that crept onto her face. Sakura
smiled back. &quot;This&#39;ll be fun we can see how good of friends we really
are.&quot;

Madison snickered a bit at that. &quot;If you guess this then I think we&#39;ll
be a lot closer...&quot; She shook her head and looked down. &quot;... or you&#39;ll
not like me any more.&quot;

Sakura frowned again. &quot;Now stop saying that! I told you that nothing
will ever make me stop liking you. Now let&#39;s see, you&#39;ve been acting
this way since Lee showed up earlier right?&quot; Madison shook her head.
&quot;Before that?&quot; A nod. &quot;Well then let&#39;s see... are you afraid one of us
could get hurt capturing Clow Cards?&quot; Madison shook her head again.
&quot;Then are you afraid I don&#39;t like your costumes? Cause if that&#39;s it you
are all wrong, because I love them.&quot; Madison&#39;s breath caught in her
throat at the mention of love, but she still shook her head.

Sakura bit her lip thinking. &quot;Well can you give me a hint? I mean some
clue?&quot; Madison looked up at her and shook her head. &quot;I... I can&#39;t. I&#39;m
sorry Sakura.&quot; Sakura looked at her sadly, but then her attention was
taken to the window. Madison looked too. &quot;What is it Sakura? Is it a
Clow Card?&quot; Sakura nodded and they walked over to the window to look
out. Suddenly a huge bat flew past the window causing both girls to
scream.

Kero came flying into the room. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Sakura pointed outside.
Kero flew to the window. Outside he saw that the neighbor&#39;s swimming
pool was filled with ice cream. &quot;Ah, it&#39;s the dream card.&quot;

Sakura looked at him. &quot;The dream card?&quot; Kero nodded. &quot;The dream card
makes whatever your fondest wish is a reality. Unfortunately if someone
is having a nightmare around it...&quot; Sakura nodded thinking of the bat.

Madison grabbed her camera and turned to Sakura. &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;

Sakura and Madison landed next to a large house. Sakura picked the wand
up and looked around them while Madison video taped everything.
Suddenly there was a movement from behind them and the dream card
appeared. It looks at Madison and smiled pleasantly. Suddenly it&#39;s form
began to change.

Sakura looked at Kero. &quot;How can I catch this one?&quot; Kero rubbed his chin
and nodded. &quot;I&#39;d say the create card has the best chance.&quot;

Sakura nodded and turned back to the dream card. It had formed into
Sakura herself and was still looking at Madison. Madison however was
staring in horror having figured out what the card was doing. She
looked at the fake Sakura, her eyes begging her not to say what she
knew was coming. Meanwhile Sakura had grabbed the create card. &quot;Create,
make a dream catcher.&quot; She tossed the card and swung her wand. The
create card turned into a board with a quill and began writing in
itself. Around the dream card a north American dream catcher appeared
binding the fake Sakura.

Sakura walked towards the other her and held up the wand. Unfortunately
the card was still focused on Madison. It looked at her with what
looked like totally understanding and just as Sakura swung the wand it
said, &quot;I love you too Madison.&quot;

Sakura was so shocked by this that she was totally speechless. Her arms
continued forward however and sealed the dream card, which floated
along with the create card into her hand. Automatically putting the
cards away Sakura turned to look at Madison.

Madison looked back at Sakura with tears in her eyes. She brought her
hand up to me mouth and bit her knuckle. Sakura and Kero both looked at
her. Then Sakura noticed the blood dripping from where her friend was
biting her hand. &quot;Madison...&quot; Before she could finish Madison turned
and ran away into the darkness. Sakura wasn&#39;t sure what to do so she
just stood there, watching her friend run away.

Madison ran for a long time. She wasn&#39;t even sure where she was going
until she saw the penguin slide at the park. She quickly climbed up the
ladder and hid inside. &quot;Why did it have to do that? Why couldn&#39;t it
have picked Sakura or Kero? Why me?&quot; She cried for a long time. Blood
dripped from her hand the entire time, but eventually stopped. Madison
also fell asleep and leaned against the wall. Before long she was
asleep.

Sakura sat down on the curb and stared off into space. Madison was in
love with her... it was almost too much to believe. Kero flew in front
of her and frowned. &quot;What&#39;s your problem?&quot;

Sakura looked up at him. &quot;She... she&#39;s in love with me...&quot;

Kero snorted. &quot;So? What&#39;s the big deal? You humans always complicate
this sort of thing so much. Look, I&#39;m heading back to the house.&quot; He
turned and flew away leaving Sakura alone.

Sakura watched him go and shook her head. Sometimes she didn&#39;t
understand Kero at all. Didn&#39;t he see how totally crazy this was?
Probably not since he wasn&#39;t human. But for some reason that didn&#39;t
make Sakura feel any better. She sighed and leaned back.

&quot;Hello Sakura. You are out late tonight.&quot; A voice said from behind her.

Sakura jumped up and looked around. Finally she saw Miss Makinzy
standing behind her. She smiled weakly at her and nodded. &quot;Yeah, I had
to catch the dream card. Is that why you are out here?&quot;

Miss Makinzy laughed pleasantly. &quot;My my you must be focused on
something. Usually you at least pretend not to know about the Clow
Cards.&quot; She carefully sat down next to Sakura. &quot;So do you want to tell
me what happened?&quot;

Sakura bit her lip. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I should. It&#39;s kind of personal.&quot;
She sighed and looked up at Miss Makinzy. &quot;Have you ever had it turn
out that some one was in love with you and you didn&#39;t even know it?&quot;

Miss Makinzy thought about it and shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m afraid not. But
I think I can sympathize. Do you think you should talk with this
person?&quot;

Sakura raised an eyebrow and looked at her. &quot;You always have a way of
making it sound like you already know everything that&#39;s going on.&quot;

Miss Makinzy tried to look innocent. &quot;Why whatever do you mean Sakura?&quot;

Sakura smiled at her, but it quickly faded. &quot;You said &#39;this person&#39; and
&#39;they&#39; an awful lot.&quot;

Miss Makinzy blushed and smiled. &quot;Well so much for the wise and
mysterious teacher. You are right of course. I&#39;ve been here for a half
hour and saw the whole thing. But what are you going to do about it?&quot;

Sakura shrugged and looked up at the sky. A full moon and a lot of
stars shown down. &quot;If I knew I&#39;d probably be doing it.&quot; She sighed and
stood up. &quot;But for now I think I just need to talk to Madison.&quot; She
started walking towards Madison&#39;s house, then stopped and looked back
at Miss Makinzy. &quot;See you in school on Monday.&quot; Miss Makinzy nodded and
turned to go in the other direction.

When she got to Madison&#39;s house Sakura checked to make sure there were
no lights on. Then she walked to Madison&#39;s window. It was open, so
Sakura climbed in and looked around. Madison was no where to be seen.
Sakura sat down on the bed and looked around the room. She had been
here before. Madison was her best friend after all. But she had never
realized just how prominently she figured in it before.

The walls were covered with pictures of her and Madison together, all
in expensive frames. Madison&#39;s desk was covered with drawings of her in
costumes Madison had made. The shelves were full of video tapes with
Sakura&#39;s name on them. Sakura got up and walked over to the desk. A
note book was open on it. Feeling a bit guilty to be reading her
friend&#39;s private thoughts Sakura casually flipped through it. Several of
the mages were just Sakura and Madison&#39;s names mixed around: Sakura
Avalon, Madison Taylor, Sakura Taylor, Madison Avalon. Sakura could
barely believe it. She turned another page and read what was written
there.

I never expected Sakura to feel the same way as I do. I am just happy
that we are so close. Maybe I should tell her how I feel. After all she
deserves to know. But what if it scares her. What if she never talks to
me again or smiled at me? That would hurt more than her not knowing. I
can&#39;t do that to her. I can&#39;t rob her of that care free feeling that
she shows around me.

But what if she feels the same? No. No that isn&#39;t going to happen. If
she did I would know by now. I will just have to try to cherish what I
have with her. At least I still have my videos and pictures of her. She
looks so beautiful in those costumes. It always made me feel so good to
see her wearing something I made for her.

I think Lee likes her too though. I don&#39;t know if she likes him or not.
If she does what will I do? That&#39;s an easy one. I&#39;ll smile and be happy
for her. No matter how much it hurts I will be happy. I just wish it
could be me. I love her so much. I just wish she could love me too.

Sakura stopped reading and ran her fingers over a crinkly part of the
paper. It looked like something had dripped on it. &quot;She must have been
crying.&quot; Sakura bit her lip and sat down in Madison&#39;s chair. It was all
rather obvious now why Madison had been keeping this from her. Sakura
knew that no matter what happened now things were going to be different
between them.

She looked up at the mirror that sat on the stand next to her. She saw
herself looking back. There was nothing special she could see. Not
anything that could make Madison feel like she did. Sakura wondered if
she could feel the same way towards Madison. They had been friends for
their entire lives. Whenever she felt bad Sakura had always known to
talk to Madison about it.

Sakura wondered how long Madison had been in love with her. Was there
any indication of it before now? Her mind wandered back over the years.
Every valentines day Madison always gave her chocolates and cards. She
never seemed to give any to anyone else. Sakura smiled remembering how
she had told Madison that she should be giving them to the person she
loved. &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving them to you Sakura.&quot; It was so obvious.

Then Sakura remembered a day a long time ago. She and Madison had been
going some where... a carnival or something. On the way Madison had
suddenly stopped and looked at her. &quot;I love you Sakura.&quot; Sakura had
thought she meant as a friend. They were only eight years old at the
time. Sakura had smiled and told her she loved her too. Madison had
looked at her and shook her head. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you when you are older.&quot;

But she hadn&#39;t. Instead Madison had grown scared and lonely, despite
being with the one she loved. Sakura shook her head and closed her
eyes. &quot;How could I be so stupid!&quot; A tear fell down her cheek. She
turned and looked at the pictures of her and Madison again. In many of
them Madison was hugging her, smiling at her, or holding her hand. But
as Sakura looked closer she could see a sadness in her friend&#39;s eyes.
No matter how big the smile was something was stopping her from looking
truly happy. And now she knew what.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe how much I hurt her.&quot; Sakura looked at the mirror
again. She did love Madison of course. They had been together their
entire lives. But could she love her for the rest of her life? Her eyes
were drawn back to the papers on the desk. Madison obviously thought
that she and Lee might end up together, or had until tonight. She
remembered how Madison had brought it up earlier. Sakura shook her head
remembering her words. So if Lee wasn&#39;t Sakura&#39;s type what was? She
looked at Madison&#39;s picture again and tried to imagine life without
her... and couldn&#39;t.

Suddenly her eyes snapped open. &quot;What if she&#39;s hurt? If she isn&#39;t here
then where is she?&quot; Sakura began to panic. When Madison had run away
her hand had been bleeding. Her eyes had looked so hurt. Sakura would
do anything to stop Madison from hurting like that again. &quot;I guess... I
guess I do love her. But if she&#39;s hurt or lost that wont do me any
good. I need to find her.&quot; Sakura looked around the room for some clue.
Her eyes passed over the mirror again. &quot;Of course!&quot; She pulled the
mirror card out and summoned it, ordering it to show her where Madison
was.

Madison&#39;s eyes opened slowly and she pulled her arms around herself. It
may not have been winter but it was still cold. Looking out at the
nights sky she sighed, causing her breath to show up in the air. She
started making a fist, but flinched and looked down at her hand. It had
blood all over it and she could see tooth marks. Quietly she cursed the
dream card. Her life was ruined now. Sakura would never want to be near
her again after this.

She could just imagine what Sakura&#39;s face would look like. Disgust,
fear, and maybe even hatred. Sakura would never want to wear her
costumes again. Would never let her video tape her any more.

New tears replaced the dried ones on her cheeks. If she had only stayed
back this one time. Suddenly she stopped and shook her head. No, Sakura
wouldn&#39;t hate her. But she would never be as free around Madison any
more. Madison would never get to hug her again and her dreams of ever
kissing Sakura were gone. She had thought that maybe one day she could
slip in a tiny kiss right on Sakura&#39;s lips. But now her friend would
know what she was doing.

Still crying Madison lay back inside the slide. She was cold and tired.
She needed to get some sleep. Her last thoughts before she went to
sleep were of Sakura.

Sakura saw Madison&#39;s eyes close as she went to sleep inside the penguin
slide. A breeze blew into he room from the open window. Sakura
shivered, &quot;It&#39;s cold out tonight.&quot; She looked back at the image of
Madison. &quot;I can&#39;t let her stay out like this. She could get sick or
something.&quot;

She put the mirror card away and grabbed the fly card. As she jumped
onto her wand and out the window Madison&#39;s mother came into the room.
&quot;Is someone here?&quot; She shivered and walked to the window. As she closed
it a single white feather fell onto the window sill. She picked it up
and looked at it for a minute. She set it down on Madison&#39;s desk and
closed the window.

Sakura, meanwhile, was flying over the city looking down. Less than an
hour ago she and Madison had been doing this exact thing. Sakura now
realized what Madison had been telling her then. Sakura would give
anything for Madison to be there with her now. Sakura almost smiled
remembering the feel of Madison&#39;s arms around her and her face buried
between Sakura&#39;s shoulder blades. But a sudden breeze across her back
washed the feeling away.

She looked down and saw the dark shapes below her. The zoo wasn&#39;t too
far from here and in the distance Sakura could just barely make out the
penguin slide. She remembered when she had been cleaning up after the
power card. That picture of her with the slide on her shoulders had
almost gotten her into a lot of trouble. If Madison hadn&#39;t claimed that
she had done it on her computer things could have gotten difficult. She
always did things like that for her.

When Sakura landed by the penguin slide she wasn&#39;t sure what she was
going to say. Quietly she walked over to the slide and slowly climbed
up the ladder leading to the top. When she got there Madison was sound
asleep inside. Sakura reached for her, then balked. Did she really love
Madison like this? If she didn&#39;t... if it was just a spur of the moment
thing she could hurt her friend a lot more. Looking over Madison&#39;s face
however she knew the answer.

She reached out again and rubbed Madison&#39;s cheek softly. It was soft,
but ice cold. Worriedly Sakura shook Madison&#39;s shoulder. When she
didn&#39;t wake up Sakura got very worried. &quot;Madison? Madison are you
alright?&quot; Madison&#39;s eyes remained closed. Sakura put her ear to
Madison&#39;s chest and listened closely. She was still breathing, but her
heart beat was slow. Sakura had to get her someplace warm and fast. She
tried to pick her up, but Madison&#39;s limp form was too heavy. No way
could she fly them like this.

Reaching into her clothes she brought out the power and dash cards. She
summoned them and felt a tingling sensation go through her body. Sakura
turned back to Madison and gently picked her up. Then she turned and
jumped out of the slide. Once she hit the ground she began running. The
landscape flew past like a blur. Sakura was using her arms to block off
as much of the wind as possible while she ran.

Once she got to her house Sakura leaped up and practically flew through
her open bedroom window. She lay Madison on her bed and put the Clow
Cards away, then closed the window. Looking around she saw that Kero
was nowhere to be seen. He had probably fallen asleep on the couch
watching television. Sakura immediately turned back to Madison who was
still asleep on her bed. Reaching behind her she dragged the chair from
in front of her desk and sat in it next to the bed, holding onto
Madison&#39;s hand. &quot;Please be alright Madison. I can&#39;t loose you.&quot; She
noticed that Madison&#39;s hand was bleeding again and got a band aid from
the bathroom. After that she simply sat next to her friend.

Hours slipped past. Sakura eventually fell asleep, laying across
Madison&#39;s stomach. The warm blankets seemed to bring the color back to
Madison&#39;s cheeks. At about 5:34 a.m. Madison yawned and opened her
eyes. The first thing she noticed was that her nose felt stuffed up.
The second thing she noticed was that she was in a soft bed instead of
the penguin slide. For a moment she had the hope that the entire night
had been a dream and things would be back to normal. But when she saw
Sakura laying across her she knew for a fact that it had all happened.

Sakura felt Madison move underneath her and her eyes snapped open.
Sitting up Sakura saw Madison looking at her and immediately wrapped
her arms around Madison&#39;s neck holding her tight. &quot;You&#39;re awake! I was
so worried about you. Promise you&#39;ll never run off like that again.&quot;
Madison was too stunned to say anything and just lay there stiff as a
board. This wasn&#39;t working out anything like what she had thought. Not
only was Sakura happy to see her but she was actually hugging her.

&quot;I... I promise...&quot; She managed.

Sakura pulled back and smiled into her eyes. &quot;And you also have to
promise not to keep stuff like that from me any more. That&#39;s not what
people who love each other do.&quot;

Madison stared at her in shock, not actually believing what she had
just heard. &quot;But you can&#39;t... you don&#39;t... I mean...&quot;

Sakura smiled at her. &quot;I want to apologize to you Madison.&quot;

Madison shook her head, &quot;Why would you need to apologize. I&#39;m the one
who embarrassed you.&quot;

Sakura frowned and looked right at her. &quot;Now Madison that isn&#39;t true.
I&#39;ve never been less embarrassed in my life. And I want to apologize to
you for not seeing how you felt. If I had I think things would have
been a lot better for you and you wouldn&#39;t have hurt so much.&quot; Sakura
reached out and put her hand on Madison&#39;s cheek and smiled at her.

Madison stared straight ahead in shock. Sakura noticed her look and
pinched her cheek pulling it to the side. &quot;Ow! What did you do that
for?&quot;

Sakura grinned and looked at her. &quot;To snap you too your senses. You
know you almost got yourself killed running off like that last night?&quot;
Madison looked down at herself and Sakura smiled at her calmly. &quot;I
don&#39;t blame you Madison. I might have done the same thing in your
position.&quot;

Madison breathed in slowly. &quot;You weren&#39;t supposed to know.&quot;

Sakura smiled and moved onto the bed next to her. &quot;I know Madison, but
did you really think I could be happy with you so sad? Or live without
you?&quot; Madison looked up at her and smiled, tears brimming at the edge
of her eyes. Sakura smiled back at her, her hand still on Madison&#39;s
cheek.

Slowly, Madison reached up and put her hand over Sakura&#39;s. &quot;I love you
Sakura. I have ever since I&#39;ve known you.&quot;

Sakura smiled and nodded. &quot;I love you too Madison.&quot;

Madison let out a quiet sob and leaned forward to hug Sakura, burying
her head into Sakura&#39;s shoulder. Sakura put her arms around Madison and
held her close, running her fingers through Madison&#39;s long dark hair.
Madison&#39;s fingers closed onto Sakura&#39;s clothes. &quot;I have wanted to hear
you say that for so long.&quot; Sakura smiled down at her and nodded.

&quot;I also have to apologize about something else. Before I found you in
the slide I went to your house and checked your room. I saw your
notebook.&quot; Sakura blushed and looked guilty.

Madison smiled at her. &quot;That&#39;s alright now. You don&#39;t have to worry
Sakura.&quot;

Sakura smiled and looked at Madison&#39;s eyes. &quot;You know, for once you
really look happy.&quot;

Madison giggled and nodded. &quot;I am.&quot; She looked over Sakura&#39;s face. &quot;I
don&#39;t suppose... I mean would you mind if I kissed you?&quot;

Sakura blushed and smiled at her. &quot;I would love to Madison. But don&#39;t
get your hopes up. I&#39;ve never done this before.&quot; She and Madison leaned
closer and looked into each other&#39;s eyes. Their noses bumped and they
turned their heads in the same direction for a minute. Then they finally
got into position and closed their eyes. As their lips met an electric
shock went down their spines. Sakura felt something move against her
lips and realized with a start that it was Madison&#39;s tongue. Her eyes
snapped open and she saw Madison kissing her. Suddenly it didn&#39;t seem
like that big of a deal. Sakura opened her mouth and let the tongue
slide in.

Madison was in heaven. She had dreamed of doing this on so many nights
she had lost count, but she had never thought it would actually happen.
Now that it had she never wanted it to end. She slid her tongue into
Sakura&#39;s mouth and opened her own eyes in surprise as Sakura&#39;s moved
against hers too. When she did she saw Sakura looking back at her.
Finally after they realized that eventually they would need to breathe
they broke apart, both breathing heavily. Sakura smiled at her and
said, &quot;That was great Madison.&quot;

Madison smiled at her. &quot;Same to you Sakura.&quot; Madison reached up with a
pale hand to rub Sakura&#39;s cheek. Her skin felt so soft and warm. Sakura
smiled at her and pulled her in for another hug and kissed Madison
behind the ear. Madison shivered slightly and buried her face into
Sakura&#39;s neck kissing her too.

Suddenly Madison pulled back and looked Sakura in the eyes. &quot;Are you
sure you want to do this? I mean you feel alright with me like this?&quot;

Sakura smiled at her and nodded. &quot;Madison there is not a doubt in my
mind. Why? Are you..?&quot;

Madison shook her head. &quot;I would love to Sakura. I just wanted you to
be sure.&quot; They held each other again as the sun came up. When they
looked at each other&#39;s faces they looked like they were glowing in the
golden dawn&#39;s light.
