<h1>Remastered III (part 4 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster3-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>It was one or two AM in the morning when Sakura felt something was 
amiss.

The doctor Nina called in fixed her up, but none of the kindly female 
doctor&#146;s assurances made Tomoyo relax. Sakura assured her she was 
alright, and that seemed to settle Tomoyo&#146;s nerves, but still. They 
made love as always, and Tomoyo seemed to be that much more comforting 
and gentle that night. Still, she didn&#146;t seem to be quite over what 
happened. And as if to accentuate that point, as Sakura woke up, she 
noticed Tomoyo was gone. Her heart was pounding but she didn&#146;t move, 
she quickly settled herself down and tried to focus. She closed her 
eyes, and opened her ears to listen around the darkened room. Opening 
her senses other than her sight as she listened. Normally, if this was 
a few years ago, she would have gone into a panic. And now, she felt 
like she wanted to panic--- but she&#146;d only wake the entire house up 
and she didn&#146;t want to do that. So, focusing on her powers and her own 
senses, she reached out and listened very carefully.

The wind whistled slightly outside, making the branches creak.

There was nobody outside in the hallway, and if Tomoyo went out she&#146;d 
have caught the attention of one of her bodyguards who would be 
fidgeting outside of their room nervous about bothering Sakura, but 
wanting to tell her something. Nobody was walking about the hallway 
either, so everything was quiet.

Then, she heard a soft whimper from the closet.

&#147;Dim lights, please.&#147; Sakura meekly whispered, waiting for the lights 
to come up slightly to a soft low dim. Slowly, carefully, she got out 
of bed and quietly slipped into her undergarments, her thoughts 
racing. As she tiptoed towards the closet she felt rather nervous, her 
body shaking slightly as she drew near. Reaching out with one 
trembling hand, Sakura gently touched the closet door and slowly 
opened it. The closet was dimly lit by the dim glow of the lights 
outside and within the closet, revealing what Sakura was looking for. 
Tomoyo. She was still naked, lying on the floor curled up in the fetal 
position, in her arms was a Sakura doll she kept for herself--- she 
was crying in her sleep, holding the doll tightly to herself.

Sakura slowly mustered her strength, and lifted Tomoyo up from the 
floor, carrying her to the bed and slowly laying her down. As Tomoyo&#146;s 
body touched the bed her eyes fluttered slightly, as she began to 
wake. Sakura laid her down and stepped back, waiting for Tomoyo to 
wake up. As she did, her eyes met Sakura&#146;s, and she quickly covered 
her face with the doll. &#147;I&#146;m sorry!&#148; she rasped.

&#147;For what?&#148; Sakura asked innocently, sitting down near Tomoyo, 
reaching out to her. &#147;I&#146;m jealous you wouldn&#146;t hug me.&#148; Sakura kidded, 
dropping onto her knees so she was eye level with Tomoyo, a hand 
reaching out to touch her pained face. &#147;Why were you in the closet?&#148;

Tomoyo, tries to smile a little, but wouldn&#146;t uncurl from her 
position. &#147;I didn&#146;t want to wake you. You looked so peaceful I---&#148; 
(stops, shivers as Sakura reaches another hand out to touch her 
shoulder) &#147;I can&#146;t forget what happened--- seeing you in pain--- the 
blood--- it scared me--- I never saw Fight so violent before--- what 
she did---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry. It&#145;s my fault. I got too close---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s NOT your fault! I--- I&#146;m scared for you---&#148; (Tomoyo looks up 
from her hiding place behind the doll, eyes teary) &#147;---I don&#146;t want to 
lose you---&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan.&#148; (Sakura slowly pries Tomoyo&#146;s arms open, reaching out and 
pulling the shivering dark haired girl into her arms where she clung 
to Sakura&#146;s body tightly. &#147;I don&#146;t want to make you cry.&#148; (stops for a 
second) &#147;Maybe I should stop being Card Captor---&#148;

&#147;NO!!&#148; Tomoyo wailed, holding Sakura tight, &#147;No! You&#146;re meant to be 
their--- it&#146;s important---&#147; Tomoyo cried, to which Sakura responded 
&#147;Your happiness is important too.&#147; For the longest time Tomoyo cried, 
and all Sakura could do was gently rock Tomoyo in her arms--- and 
comfort her the best she could. Finally, Sakura crawled up onto the 
bed with Tomoyo, as her tears and wailing dimmed and stop, and they 
laid there in bed together. Tomoyo, in a weak whisper, said &#147;I don&#145;t 
want Fight to hurt you anymore.&#148;

&#147;I&#145;ll try to reason with her.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s too dangerous! She---&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s in pain. Just like you--- she only wants to protect the one she 
loves.&#148;

Tomoyo nods her head, sinking into Sakura&#146;s loving grip. But she 
didn&#146;t tell Sakura everything.

She had a night vision, a scary one--- and she saw what she thought 
Fight must have seen, only instead of the young man it was Sakura--- 
face down in the grass, a large male behind her--- tears flowing down 
her face as she cried out in pain--- Tomoyo stopped suddenly, and 
chided herself for focusing on that, and lost herself in Sakura&#146;s 
loving touch.

-----

&#147;No school?&#148; Sakura asked, looking down at her school uniform on 
herself (she had gotten dressed on time for once) &#147;I called the school 
and explained everything. Doctor said to take the day off, remember?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine! And we should go to school because today&#146;s a---&#148; Tomoyo 
pushes Sakura back into bed, her skirt coming up abit as she hits, her 
body bouncing into the bed as Tomoyo smiles. &#147;Everyone said they&#146;re 
coming over to help today.&#148; (&#147;Help?&#148; Sakura asked confused, lying 
prone on the bed in a rather awkward and a tad risque position) &#147;We&#146;re 
having school in here today.&#148;

&#147;?&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan---&#148; Tomoyo sighs, moving onto the bed, &#147;You&#146;re just too 
tempting to pass up!&#148;

Sakura knew what was on her mind, or what came close to her knowing as 
she blushed and smiled &#147;I guess I&#146;m in the right position for that 
then.&#148;

Homeroom (an hour later)

Everyone was there, and then some. They all took a space on the floor 
roughly in the set-up of a classroom with the back of the class going 
to the huge bed where Tomoyo/Sakura sat (still in their school 
clothes). 

Rena was there, and she bought Trinity to fill classroom space (she 
had a substitute at school today for the test, and was planning on 
doing that anyway since she somehow made everyone nervous when she 
gave out tests). Keiko was there, and so was her significant other Eve 
(who looked a little nervous with the impromptu set-up).

Meilin bought Xai to class (who was uncertain about what she could do 
for the &#147;class&#148;), while Nina and Eliza were there to fill spaces in 
class. Kero was also there, and completed the class of 11.

At first, Keiko suggested that Eliza take the role of Mr. Terada for 
some classes--- but that only made Nina huffy and she accused Keiko of 
being a racist against Amazonians, and that lasted for the length of 
homeroom (Sakura wished she didn&#145;t know what set Nina off, as did 
everyone else who knew exactly what Keiko was hinting at--- except 
Meilin who was rather clueless, leaving Xai a rather sticky wicket 
later in explaining to her confused love what was going on (later)). 
The next class hopefully would be less loud.

------

First Period (Keiko&#146;s free study period)

&#147;School?&#148; Mirra asked in confusion, looking about the room at the 
ensemble cast of characters as she sat on Sakura/Tomoyo&#146;s bed in her 
school uniform. &#147;I didn&#146;t know you liked to play school in your room, 
Tomoyo-mama---&#148;

&#147;Wow.&#148; Rena sighed, looking about the class at everyone faces (filled 
with either anticipation, boredom, or confusion) &#147;True to form, eh? 
Nothing like a boring study period even on a day like this.&#148;

&#147;Still not teaching nothing so get off my back.&#148; Keiko hissed, 
stretching out and lying back onto the floor lazily. &#147;Tell me when 
it&#146;s 2nd Period.&#148;

&#147;You lazy bum!&#148; Rena hissed, shaking Keiko by the rump. &#147;Get up! Just 
because we&#146;re all on the floor doesn&#146;t mean you get to slouch off--- 
TRINITY!! Don&#145;t copy her!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sleepy! (And this is boring!)&#148; she muttered, flopping down on 
Rena&#146;s lap and closing her eyes, &#147;Wake me when the number munching 
starts!&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s number crunching and---&#148; (sighs) &#147;---come on! Not you too! Get 
up!&#148;

&#147;---Tomo-mama needs better playmates.&#148; Mirra concludes with a confused 
expression on her face. Her features suddenly brighten as Hikaru, 
dressed in her school fineries carrying their school bags came in. 
&#147;Though school for us ended yesterday for break I guess we could play 
&#147;school&#148; with---&#148; (Tomoyo and Sakura both nod their heads in a 
reassuring manner as Hikaru looks on slightly nervous at them) 
&#147;---Tomoyo-mama and Sakura-papa--- is it alright if I---?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s alright! Your like family, Hikaru! Come on, sit down!&#148; Sakura 
gleefully motions, pointing for Hikaru to sit next to Mirra which she 
does. The two smile as Hikaru cozies up next to Mirra, passing her bag 
as the two exchange kisses and cuddle close for &#147;class&#148;.

From the floor, Kero gets up from his spot and flies over to the TV. 
&#147;I&#146;m going to teach the merry ole&#146; class of Mario Party 4. Anyone else 
want to learn with me? Four players can play, you know!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m in!&#148; (Rena) (rolling Trinny over as she got up)

&#147;ME!&#148; (Trinity) &#147;I wanna play!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m going to watch.&#148; (Meilin announces, pulling Xai along)

&#147;I&#146;ll stay here.&#148; (Eve)

&#147;We&#146;re fine here.&#148; Hikaru announces, reaching a hand out to hold 
Mirra&#146;s hand as Sakura/Tomoyo both lean back on the pile of pillows 
set up against the headboard of their bed, reaching out to take each 
other&#146;s hand in turn.

&#147;-----&#148; (Keiko nods in agreement, moving closer to Eve)

&#147;I&#146;m in.&#148; (Nina, to which Eliza nods her head and follows to watch)

As everyone goes to play, Keiko &amp; Eve climb up on the bed and lie down 
at the foot, looking up at the four on the bed. &#147;Nice. The kids are 
going to goof off first period. As if I cared---&#148; Keiko sighed, 
stretching out on the bed. &#147;Is my class really this boring?&#148;

&#147;It does give us a chance to study for tests.&#148; Tomoyo remarks, trying 
to put a positive spin on the question asked. &#147;We don&#145;t go to your 
class but I&#145;m sure it&#145;s a great class.&#148; Hikaru offered in addition.

&#147;I figured at least someone&#146;s getting some use out of it.&#148; Keiko feels 
Eve&#146;s hands grab her side, rolling the older woman over onto Eve&#146;s 
lap. As Keiko gets comfortable, she begins talking to no one in 
general. &#147;I&#146;m too old to teach anyone. I&#146;m not up on current things, I 
barely get by on my own, heaven forbid teaching what I know to all 
those kids. And I wasn&#146;t enamored with the thought of reliving my 
&#147;past&#148; to do a history class, even though Rena seems to love it even 
though she&#146;s not even 50 yet.&#148;

&#147;Whine, whine, whine.&#148; Rena mumbles from her place in front of the TV. 
&#147;No wonder the forces of heaven and hell cut a wide swath away from 
your location. You whine and kill too much, but it&#145;s mostly the 
whining that drives them away!&#148;

&#147;I just don&#146;t feel like I have much to contribute to my &#147;role&#148; in that 
school but a free period.&#148; Keiko continues, ignoring Rena on purpose, 
&#147;It was the Goddesses who had the idea of making us teachers in the 
first place, and I didn&#146;t approve of that tired old scenario from the 
start.&#148;

At that Rena snickers, &#147;Which is why I&#146;m in the role you were supposed 
to fill as history teacher.&#148;

&#147;Whatever.&#148; Keiko sighs, &#147;Go torment Mario, you jerk--- still, I wish 
I could contribute.&#148;

&#147;You contribute a lot!&#148; Sakura pitches in Keiko&#146;s defense. &#147;You&#146;re a 
great help and we can&#146;t get through some of these hard captures 
without your guidance and help!&#148;

&#147;What about us?!&#148; Nina calls out from her spot at the TV, &#147;What are 
we, chopped liver?&#148;

&#147;I contribute too!&#148;

&#147;Everyone contributes.&#148; Tomoyo diplomatically answers, bringing 
silence in the room. Almost.

&#147;How about every other round we rotate and pass the controller off? 
That way everyone plays! I&#146;ll pass off my controller to Meilin this 
round and she passes off to Xai next round while I share with Trinny.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m going to go watch---&#148; Keiko mutters, pulling Eve along with her 
leaving the four alone. Tomoyo reaches out and touches Mirra on the 
shoulder, &#147;I haven&#146;t seen you around much.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ve been hanging together ever since she moved on--- I---&#148; Mirra 
blushes, leaning on Hikaru&#146;s shoulder for support as Hikaru grips 
Mirra&#146;s hand tighter and smiles at her. &#147;We understand. It was the 
same when Sakura &amp; I were first living together. Remember?&#147; (Sakura 
nods her head, blushing abit at those early days and how that 
affection just grew and grew from those days which was like a dream 
everyday. &#147;I&#146;m glad you two are hitting it off so well. Your such a 
cute couple!&#148;

&#147;You two must make each other very happy!&#148; Sakura added, her face 
glowing with happiness for the two of them. At this attention they 
both blushed deeply, fidgeting abit as they looked back and forth at 
each other and at the two watching them. &#147;Hikaru-chan&#146;s the best thing 
that ever happened to me, Sakura-papa--- I mean besides you two 
becoming my mommy and daddy of course!&#148;

&#147;Well said.&#148; Hikaru chided gently, nudging Mirra a little bit with her 
arm. &#147;Then why does my little Mirra-chan still cry sometimes at 
night?&#148;

Mirra blushes, trying to turn away but Hikaru turns her head so they 
stare into each other&#146;s eyes. &#147;Your still worried about Mimic, aren&#146;t 
you?&#148;

&#147;I---&#148; (Mirra stammers, but slowly finds her words with a little 
prodding from Hikaru and Tomoyo) &#147;---I don&#146;t want her to hurt you--- I 
love you--- if anything happened to you--- it&#145;d be my fault---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;d never be your fault my brave heroic loveable princess you. Your 
only crime is loving me.&#147;

&#147;That was a lot of words for one breath.&#147; Mirra whispered, eyes abit 
wide, to which Hikaru places two fingers firmly on Mirra&#146;s lips and 
whispers &#147;Hush.&#147; before continuing, stopping when Mirra whispered &#147;Mu 
muv moo.&#148;

&#147;?&#148; (removes fingers)

&#147;I love you--- sorry, your fingers were---&#148; (Mirra puts her fingers on 
Hikaru&#146;s lips and pinches, causing the other girl to lean back briefly 
in surprise) &#147;---sorry.&#148;

&#147;I know, I know, I love you too my rambunctious, wild little precious 
thing you. (sorry about the fingers)&#148; (Hikaru&#146;s fingers grip onto 
Mirra&#146;s cheeks and pinches them) &#147;I love everything about you. Rosey 
cheeks, big appetite, lovely innocence, and attachment to your 
favorite stuffed toys. I love the whole package and nothing Mimic can 
do will change my heart&#146;s feelings. I love you my little Mirra-chan.&#148;

&#147;Stwop th&#146;!&#147; (Hikaru releases her grip) &#147;I&#146;m not THAT little!&#148; Mirra 
growls in little, blushing at the attention, hand rubbing her face. 
&#147;Not in front of mama and papa! I feel like a kid when you do that!&#148;

&#147;But you started it, you little minx you!&#148;

The two laugh, falling onto the bed giggling as they start to try and 
tickle each other.

In the backdrop, Sakura/Tomoyo watch on, their smiles and expression 
almost as if they&#146;re two loving parents watching the same feelings of 
love and caring between themselves blossom in their daughter and the 
one she loves. They couldn&#146;t stop feeling protective of the two--- 
briefly Tomoyo flashed back to what happened--- and her teeth clenched 
unseen. If Mimic ever hurt her precious daughter or her daughter&#146;s 
sweet lover ever again--- Tomoyo pushed those thoughts away, she 
didn&#146;t want to hurt anyone.

&#147;She must be so alone to be so full of hate.&#148; she whispered, barely 
catching Sakura&#146;s attention. &#147;What did you say?&#148;

&#147;I said she must be on her second wind to be so feisty.&#148;

&#147;I guess.&#148; Sakura nodded, watching the two at play, not noticing 
Tomoyo&#146;s change of mood from introspective to being happy again.

Period 2 - Math

It was a good thing Mirra and Hikaru came to &#147;class&#148; today, it seemed 
that the school sent one of Nina&#146;s assistants to the Daidouji 
Residence to have someome give Sakura a re-test on math. Nina pushed 
through the corrections and the results faster than the other tests 
because she was dying to see if all that cramming Sakura did for the 
test really paid off or not--- it didn&#146;t, she still had to re-test.

The others had saved their game and came back for the second period, 
planning to go back to the game during fourth period PE class.

Both Mirra and Hikaru helped Sakura cram for the test for one hour, as 
Tomoyo sat with Nina and the two went over with Ms. Mitsuki (over the 
phone) how to administer the test. Keiko was to monitor the whole test 
to insure it was legit, and since she was the fabled and dreaded 7th 
Judgement, nobody at Sakura&#146;s school would dare question her OK of the 
test once she signed her &#147;John Hancock&#148; on the finished test and 
certified it was given fairly and without any cheating involved.

As everyone sat back, they watched Sakura work over her test (or just 
sat near her but staring in the opposite direction, leaning against 
the bed) while she worked under the loving gaze of Tomoyo who, while 
not helping, gave Sakura confidence to continue. She finished on time, 
and turned in her test. It was signed, put into a tamper proof 
envelope and sealed for grading at school. Sakura seemed rather 
embarrassed that she ended up having to do the make-over test, but 
Tomoyo only chided her gently and they left the room for awhile for a 
discussion.

&#147;They&#146;re doing it.&#148; Rena sighs, leaning against the bed. &#147;I tell you 
they&#146;re---&#148; (a foot kicks Rena in the side, that foot belonging to one 
scowling Keiko Yamanaka) &#147;The girls are in here, dummy! Why don&#146;t you 
give them a blow by blow account while your at it!&#148;

Rena shrugs it off, turning over to the two. &#147;They&#146;re 14, they can 
handle it.&#148;

&#147;No they&#146;re not 14! They&#146;re---&#148; (stops, looks, blinks a few times) 
&#147;Are--- you can&#146;t be.&#148;

The two nod their heads. &#147;I wanted to be a little older so I could be 
with my Mirra-chan forever, so I made a wish at a forest shrine near 
auntie Fuu&#146;s summer house and I grew up a little.&#148;

&#147;I made a wish too---&#148;

Everyone&#146;s eyes turn and focus on Mirra. &#147;AND?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s---- it&#146;s----&#148; (everyone leans forward to listen)

&#147;IT&#146;S A SECRET!!&#148;

Everyone faints.

Hikaru smiles as she bumps her head against Mirra&#146;s forehead slightly, 
&#147;What am I ever going to do with you my silly lover?&#148;

Mirra smiles at the compliment.

(Editor&#146;s Note - &#147;A Wish For Lovers&#148; coming soon)

Period 3 - Arts &amp; Science

&#147;Another free period?&#148; Rena sighed irritably.

&#147;We just came off break so shove off. Anyway it would be free period 
in class today too because the test was Monday and Sakura aced it--- 
wait---&#148; Keiko looks over at Meilin, &#147;Why aren&#146;t you taking midterm 
exams?&#148;

&#147;I already did back in the Shining Star before transfer, so I&#146;m ahead 
of my classmates in that respect. They&#146;ll catch up to me when we enter 
the new semester after break next year. I don&#145;t mind though, it gives 
me a chance to focus on Xai while I wait for them to get up to my 
level.&#148;

Nina huffs her breath as she looks over at Meilin, &#147;Well your just so 
very humble aintcha!&#148; (sighs) &#147;It&#146;s free period so back to Professor 
Kero&#146;s Mario Party 4 class!&#148;

As everyone goes back to the game, both Mirra and Hikaru go to watch, 
leaving Sakura &amp; Tomoyo alone to talk. &#147;They&#146;ve grown so much since 
that trip.&#148; Sakura noted.

&#147;Magic does that to two girls in love.&#148; Tomoyo kids, nudging Sakura in 
the arm, &#147;Remember? It made you into such a mature woman in the time I 
knew you. And it made me the happiest girl in the whole wide world the 
day you and I swore to be together forever.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan!&#147; (Sakura blushes at the compliment) &#147;I remember! But it 
was sweet of them--- I mean--- I&#146;m glad they found each other.&#148; 
(Sakura shies away a little, blushing from cheek to cheek at Tomoyo&#146;s 
smiles and playful proddings)

&#147;I glad for them too. Everyone should find such happiness, regardless 
of whether it&#145;s boy/girl, girl/girl or boy/boy--- I know they&#145;re 
happy, just like your brother Toya &amp; Yuki are happy together.&#148; (Tomoyo 
turns and looks at the two as they sit together, hand in hand, 
watching the game as they enjoy each other&#146;s presence) &#147;They deserve 
to be happy.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan---&#148; Sakura suddenly blushes abit, &#147;Do you think they&#146;re--- 
I mean---&#148;

&#147;Do you mean sexually active? Do you want the truth or---&#148;

Sakura swallows hard, and nods her head weakly. &#147;Yeah. I&#146;m ready.&#148;

&#147;You sure?&#148; Tomoyo smirks, looking up and down at her love, &#147;You look 
kinda motion sick.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m OK!&#148; (Sakura whispers in a strong but soft tone, sits up 
straight, mustering her courage for the question) &#147;I want to know. I 
want to be a good parent to Mirra-chan.&#148;

&#147;Even though you never talked to your brother about Mirra&#146;s &#147;crush&#148;?&#148;

&#147;---&#148; (Sakura&#146;s face falls into a frown) &#147;---I&#146;m sorry!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m just kidding.&#148; (two of Tomoyo&#146;s fingers each touch Sakura&#146;s face, 
pushing her frown into a smile) &#147;Don&#146;t stop smiling. It&#146;s your best 
trait. And you&#146;re a great parent to our Mirra-chan.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan.&#148; (smiling) &#147;So--- is she---?&#148;

Tomoyo nods and shakes her head, causing Sakura to face fault. &#147;Eh? I 
don&#145;t---&#148;

&#147;They&#146;re---&#148; (draws close, and speaks in a hushed whisper) &#147;---they&#146;re 
not having major sex, but Mirra asked me about oral sex. I think she 
wants to &#147;present&#148; Hikaru with oral lovemaking on Christmas Eve night 
as a present. She wanted to do it for Hikaru just right, she was so 
cute in how nervous she was.&#148;

Sakura, blushing from ear to ear, looks at Tomoyo, &#147;Is that OK?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s OK. I had a long talk with Mirra and taught her the ropes. She&#146;s 
going to be gentle, and they&#146;ll keep their lovemaking to oral and 
finger probing for awhile--- Sakura?&#148; (looks at brown haired girl) 
&#147;Your burning red---? Oh---&#148; (smiles sheepishly) &#147;I forgot you don&#146;t 
like talking about this kind of stuff.&#148;

&#147;I-I-it&#146;s OK! Really--- but what did--- I mean what kind of--- is 
it--- I mean Tomo-chan--- I---&#148;

Tomoyo brings her fingers to her face making a sign and smirks, &#147;Lick, 
lick, and---&#148; (brings her fingers of one hand down to touch her other 
hand) &#147;---stroke stroke, nothing too severe.&#148; (smiles) &#147;They&#146;re taking 
their time learning love in all forms. I&#146;m glad they want to 
experiment yet slowly and with great care. It shows how much they want 
to savor each and every moment of their growing love. I&#146;m happy for 
them.&#148;

&#147;----I am too--- I&#145;m just a little--- I mean---&#148;

&#147;Maybe we should watch the game--- or I could make you blush for a 
whole different reason---&#148;

Sakura smiles, sinking into the bed allowing the sheets to cover her 
up to her neck, knowing what was coming next and relishing the moments 
to come.

Meanwhile, Keiko, at the controls now, nudge Eve. &#147;Do it.&#148;

Eve smiles, and conceals one hand as she chants a silent spell, 
weaving the runes with her hand in the air, drawing each symbol in 
light energy writing briefly marking the air as she spells reach rune.

For the rest of the period? Well, everyone was too engrossed with the 
game to even think of looking behind them (and nothing too severe 
happened anyway, but still--- it was if by magic that their attentions 
were so focused on the game--- wonder why---)

-----

Period 4 - English

&#147;Nina. Do it.&#148; Keiko prodded, looking at the green haired girl who 
didn&#146;t know what she was talking about. &#147;Do what?&#148;

&#147;Do it! You know, that English thing. The one Mina is good at.&#148;

&#147;---oh--- you mean Mina&#146;s word of English she spouted in that episode? 
Any reason why?&#148;

&#147;Didn&#146;t you play Mina&#146;s daughter in that failed Sailor Solider thing? 
I remember that---&#148;

&#147;Yes, oh &#147;boss&#148; who was going to be Trooper Moon. I remember that 
too--- of COURSE you remember that!&#148; (Nina scoffs) &#147;You were in that 
too so give me a break!&#148;

&#147;Well?&#148;

Nina sighs, leans back and in perfect tone goes &#147;Why?&#148; bringing a 
torrent of claps from Keiko. &#147;Poke yourself with a fork, dork-knight, 
I think you&#146;re DONE!&#148; Nina hisses, rolling over to pout.

&#147;Anyone here knows English---&#148; (everyone raises their hands) 
&#147;---WITHOUT the use of a translator chip or device?&#148; (most of the 
hands go down except for Tomoyo, Hikaru, Nina, Eliza, Rena, Trinity, 
Keiko (of course), Eve and Kero) &#147;AND without the use of a translator 
spell.&#148; (Trinity &amp; Kero put their hands down---- followed by Eve a few 
seconds later) &#147;I&#146;m better at German than English.&#148; she admits.

&#147;That means half the class knows English, and the other half---&#148; 
(looks at others) &#147;---need to learn it. Well, you know what that 
means---&#148;

Everyone leans forward, looking at her intently.

&#147;Free period! I don&#146;t like teaching.&#148;

Everyone faints.

&#147;NOT ANOTHER FREE PERIOD! I THOUGHT WE WE&#146;RE HERE TO TEACH SAKURA 
SOMETHING YOU MORON!!&#148;

&#147;Well then you teach English class! After all, your quite happy being 
the object of attention up in the front of the class ranting at 
everyone like your such a know-it-all!!&#148;

&#147;----&#148;

&#147;That sounds like a good idea!&#148; Tomoyo agrees (before Rena/Keiko comes 
to blows) &#147;Anyone wants to start off the class?&#148;

Silence, as they all look around waiting for someone to start off. 
Silence reigned for a long period of time, until finally she said--- 
&#147;I can&#146;t think of a thing.&#148;

Everyone faints.

Rena, pulling herself off from the floor, collapses face first into 
the bed as she speaks, &#147;Did you all hear about tomorrow&#146;s unscheduled 
field trip?&#148;

&#147;Field trip?&#148; everyone asked.

&#147;Seems---&#148; (Rena pulls herself up, sitting herself back down on the 
floor leaned against the bed as everyone watches intently) &#147;---Miss 
NamoCatCat invited Sakura&#146;s class to Tokyo Zoo (which she&#146;s a major 
stockholder in) because she&#146;s taking a bath on visits during the 
Christmas holidays (too many people movie watching and shopping) and 
she&#146;s probably banking on a good promo boost if the Card Captor showed 
up at her zoo tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;And it would probably also help abit if Sakura were to &#147;capture&#148; a 
card there.&#148; Keiko added, knowing where this was all headed. &#147;I figure 
she&#146;ll do it again.&#148;

Sakura sighs, dropping like a rock into the bed as Tomoyo sweat drops, 
&#147;Not another Flower incident.&#148; Sakura sighs, &#147;Sakura&#146;s right.&#148; 
(Tomoyo) &#147;The previous incident was bad enough, but she&#146;s going to do 
it again?&#148;

Keiko nods her head, looking abit peeved at the thought. &#147;It IS 
NamoCatCat we&#146;re talking about here. While she does have her 
occasional good points (the Christmas thing for example--- which she 
benefited from anyway so it&#146;s not like she didn&#146;t make a bundle off of 
that program) she does seem to go for the lowest common denominator--- 
m-o-n-e-y.&#148;

&#147;I can&#146;t believe our ship&#146;s chief engineer is actually related to THAT 
thing!&#148; Nina grumbles, to which Eliza nods her head in affirmation. 
&#147;She does seem rather unlike her older sisters.&#148;

&#147;Sisters?&#148;

&#147;Miyuko NamoCatCat. She works with Nina on the Ryoko, younger sister. 
Mi&#146;Shari NamoCatCat. She&#146;s going to Guardian Academy up on the Central 
Hub. Older sister to Miyuko, twin sister to Misho.&#148;

Everyone nods their heads or sighs as they all lean back. Rena looks 
around the room bored, &#147;Anyone think of inviting an English teacher 
today? Because on this topic I know nadda.&#148;

Nina collapses on the floor out of boredom. &#147;We could banter around 
dirty English limericks.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll take the break instead.&#148; Rena grumbles, also collapsing. &#147;Make 
the day go faster!&#148;

&#147;---maybe we should just skip forward to the next period---&#148; Tomoyo 
offers.

Period 5 - PE

&#147;How can we possibly have PE indoors?&#148; Sakura asked, looking about the 
room, &#147;The bedroom isn&#146;t big enough for any sort of physical 
exertion.&#148;

&#147;And your taking the day off---&#148; Keiko concludes. &#147;Who wants to skip 
PE?&#148;

&#147;I want to play a sports video game!&#148; (Kero)

&#147;Me too!&#148; (Trinity)

Nina scowls at the others, &#147;Is there something four people can--- 
oh---&#148; (looks at game) &#147;Soccer? Fine. You all go play while we sit 
here with Sakura.&#148;

As everyone goes to set up, Nina lies down on the bed and stares into 
the ceiling above, &#147;I wonder how they&#146;re doing---&#148;

&#147;Who?&#148; Tomoyo asks, &#147;Fight and her boy of course. From what Kero said 
I never would have pictured Fight as the affectionate type.&#148;

&#147;Sometimes it happens,&#148; Eliza remarks, nudging Nina in the arm as she 
stares down at the green haired girl from her place on the bed. &#147;It 
just happens when someone falls in love with someone else.&#148;

At first Nina cracks a smile, but it melts into a pouty frown. &#147;I 
guess---&#148;

&#147;Nina.&#148; Eliza whispers, leaning down, &#147;I&#146;m not making you wait to 
torment you. I know how badly you wish I&#146;d say &#147;yes&#148;--- but---&#148; Eliza 
stops as she looks at Nina&#146;s pouty expression. &#147;---ask me again 
Christmas Eve please---&#148;

&#147;---&#148;

&#147;Ask me again. You never know what I might say this year---&#148;

&#147;I guess.&#148;

&#147;Nina---&#148; (Eliza pulls Nina off the bed and they wander off out of the 
room to talk)

&#147;I wish they could make it happen this year.&#148; Sakura whispers, causing 
Tomoyo to giggle slightly, &#147;What&#146;s so funny?&#148;

&#147;They&#146;ll make it happen. Don&#146;t you worry your sweet, silly little 
heart. It&#146;ll happen. I know it.&#148;

&#147;Your sure?&#148; Sakura&#146;s eyes glisten abit as she asks, to which Tomoyo 
nods her head vigorously. &#147;Certainly! Just like one day it&#146;ll happen 
for us.&#148;

The two smile, and kiss, unwatched by everyone playing the game (this 
time through no magical intervention or spellwork).

Rena smirks as she nails in another goal. &#147;Are they going to strip 
topless at the end of the game and shamelessly show close up boobies? 
I&#145;d love to see that.&#148;

&#147;I knew we shouldn&#146;t have played the women&#146;s soccer tournament game.&#148; 
Keiko sighed.

------

Period 6 - Social Studies

Tomoyo called for Light/Dark to bring a large set of cooking ware from 
the kitchen into the room, and with someone already making an earlier 
run to the store (Keiko) the class was set for a baking lesson.

&#147;No you can&#146;t eat the batter from the bowl! Think of the bacteria!&#148;

Everyone boos Rena, tossing balls of paper napkins at her.

&#147;I don&#146;t know about all of you,&#148; Nina remarked holding up the box of 
cake mix, &#147;But I grew up on feasting on the gooey chocolate remains 
after making the cupcakes! Anyone else?&#148;

Lots of hands go up.

&#147;But this is cake mix, not cupcake mix.&#148;

Nina nudges Eliza playfully, waving their box in front of her as she 
did. &#147;Cake mix is fine for cupcakes. Just need the proper baking gear 
and cake mix can easily be used for just about anything except 
brownies which need something more to make it work (cake mix won&#146;t cut 
it alone).&#148;

&#147;Something more?&#148;

&#147;Brownies are completely different beasts than cupcakes. They require 
more goodness in them.&#148;

At this Keiko snickers, &#147;Good thing Nina&#146;s so proficient at desserts, 
or we&#146;d be lost without her.&#148;

&#147;I happen to know a lot about a lot of cooking, thank you very much!&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s not what Michi says.&#148;

&#147;---shove you and Michi, Keiko, now are we going to bake or are we 
going to bake?&#148;

&#147;Bake.&#148; (everyone nodded as the class began).

As Sakura read the instructions on the floor, Tomoyo smiled and looked 
at the apron she wore, &#147;Your cute in that apron, Sakura-chan.&#148; Sakura 
blushed, looking down at the apron Tomoyo got her once to cheer her up 
after a bad cooking incident, &#147;I feel a little silly being called the 
&#147;greatest&#148; anything.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re the greatest to me, Sakura-chan--- and I love you for being 
who you are.&#148;

&#147;---Tomo-chan---&#148;

&#147;Maybe after baking while we wait for the cupcakes to cook we&#146;ll put 
some use towards our leftover batter and have a sweet &#147;treat&#148; later.&#148; 
Tomoyo smiles, a little twinkle shining in her eye.

Sakura gulps down hard, and begins stirring in the batter, knowing 
what Tomoyo was playfully hinting at. &#147;You&#146;re sweet, Tomo-chan.&#148;

&#147;Not as sweet as my sweetness once I dab a little special something in 
the right place.&#148;

Sakura starts to beat faster, feeling herself sweat abit at the 
thought of things to come.

Five minutes into the class---

&#147;Rena! Get your girlfriend out of my face!&#148; Nina growls, pushing 
Trinity away, &#147;No sticking your face into my bowl!&#148;

&#147;Come here and lick out our bowl.&#148; Rena motions, handing the bowl off 
as she finishes her cupcakes. &#147;I&#146;m done.&#148;

Everyone else motions that they&#146;re done, passing them all over to be 
taken into the kitchen which Sakura/Tomoyo does. As they leave, Nina 
takes out the ingredients for the topping. &#147;Alright, you choco-holics, 
try not to EAT the topping until it&#146;s ON the cupcakes. I know the urge 
to eat concentrated chocolate is abit too much on some of you---&#148;

&#147;This coming from the person who nearly shoved her face into her bowl 
to clean up the remains.&#148; Keiko scoffed, &#147;Oh, wait, you DID shove your 
face into the bowl at the end.&#148;

&#147;Only to keep Trinny from getting the rest!&#148; Nina defended herself, 
leaning against the bed. &#147;Anyone notice how Sakura/Tomoyo didn&#146;t touch 
their stuff?&#148;

&#147;Maybe they&#146;re not chocolate guzzling freaks like some of us?&#148; Rena 
remarked.

&#147;I bet they&#146;re doing naughty things with their---&#148;

&#147;NOT IN FRONT OF THE GIRLS!!&#148; Everyone growls.

&#147;---they&#146;re 14, it&#146;s not like it&#146;s something evil I&#146;m---&#148;

&#147;NINA!!&#148;

&#147;---sigh, sorry!&#148;

Everyone looks over at the two, each gleefully spooning out drippings 
with their fingers and feeding each other chocolate by finger. &#147;I wish 
we thought of that!&#148; Nina sighs, causing everyone to groan. &#147;Well now 
you mention it!&#148;

&#147;Eat the chocolate!&#148; Trinity motions at the icing.

&#147;I&#146;m going to pick up the stuff for home. Whip it up, and then cover 
Eve in it like a chocolate treat and eat her from head to toe.&#148;

&#147;I thought you said not in front of the girls?&#148; Nina remarked, to 
which Keiko shrugs, &#147;They&#146;re old enough to listen to that! They&#146;re not 
babies.&#148;

&#147;Oh, right, so it&#146;s alright for YOU to talk trash but not---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m just saying what I&#146;ll do, I didn&#146;t bring sex into---&#148;

&#147;Yes, you did.&#148;

&#147;No I didn&#146;t!&#148;

&#147;Yes you did.&#148;

&#147;No I didn&#146;t!&#148;

Everyone sighs once again. &#147;Anyone bring gummy bears?&#148;

------

Period 7 - History

Once again, the presence of Mirra &amp; Hikaru paid off as they helped 
Sakura cram for her big History exam. Meanwhile, Tomoyo, Rena &amp; Keiko 
talked about it.

&#147;How hard is the test?&#148;

&#147;Hard enough. I&#146;m not giving out pushover tests, you know!&#148;

&#147;Look, Ms. Psycho-perfection, the question Tomoyo wanted answered is 
whether or not Sakura can pass this test, not how meticulously fascist 
your testing etiquette is!&#148;

&#147;Just because you&#146;re a high school dropout doesn&#146;t mean Sakura can&#146;t 
take something---&#148;

&#147;They didn&#146;t have High School when I was alive you nitwit! Did you---&#148;

&#147;Yes I graduated from HS, but what does---&#148;

Nina steps in, &#147;Did you know if you take the initials for High School 
and drop a L in between you know what you&#146;d have?&#148;

&#147;You going away.&#148; Keiko growls, pushing Nina away, &#147;So did you get 
anywhere with that?&#148;

&#147;Kinda hard to get anywhere if your run over by a truck after 
graduation and die you dummy!&#148;

&#147;Well that was fast! Should have saved the nation a few yen and got 
run over as a Freshman!&#148;

&#147;What a bunch of---&#148;

&#147;Excuse me---?&#148;

&#147;WHAT!?!&#148;

&#147;Sakura&#146;s test?&#148;

&#147;Here.&#148; (Rena sighs, handing over the test) &#147;You have to take it too 
so don&#146;t look too long.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, she might have to kill you if you learn the deceptively easy 
methods by which she copied other people&#146;s history tests and stamped 
her name on the photocop---&#148;

&#147;HMPH!&#148; (Rena storms off to watch the video game playing)

&#147;Must be that time of year.&#148; (Keiko walks off, leaving Tomoyo with the 
test in her hands and a confused expression on her face.)

The test was easier that they though, though Sakura still sweated 
through it. As the papers were collected, Sakura collapsed into 
Tomoyo&#146;s arms for a cuddle as she came down from her testing high. 
&#147;There&#146;s a good girl. You did great! That was good work.&#148;

As Rena seals the tests and dates them, she looks over at Keiko 
briefly, &#147;From what I can see they aced it rather well. She did her 
studies alright.&#148;

&#147;Did you have any doubt?&#148;

&#147;Maybe, but it&#146;s nice to see that I was wrong. She&#146;s getting a little 
better each day at studying.&#148;

&#147;Growing up?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s the point of it all, isn&#146;t it? One day everyone grows up.&#148;

&#147;Then what happens?&#148; Keiko ponders, walking off before Rena could 
question her further, &#147;Must be that time of year.&#148; Rena mutters, 
putting the test with the math test to be sent back for grading.

-------

After school

Everyone was gone, the day&#146;s events still fresh in their mind as the 
two cuddled up on the couch and watched TV. Sakura&#146;s head cuddled 
against Tomoyo&#146;s breasts as they watched, laughed, and talked.

Nina and Eliza went back to their room to eat cupcakes and play with 
another box of batter.

Everyone else went home, though there seemed to be less cupcake tins 
than there were at the beginning of the cooking class--- as if a few 
walked out of the door with some of the &#147;students&#148; after class.

But for the two lovers, all their fears, worries, and concerns for now 
were gone.

All that mattered was each other, and the fun they had that day. 
Tomorrow was the trip to the zoo, and most likely a confrontation with 
Power, not to mention the rematch with Fight--- but that was later, 
for now, all that mattered was each other.

And for now wasn&#146;t that enough?

Or so it goes at least.
