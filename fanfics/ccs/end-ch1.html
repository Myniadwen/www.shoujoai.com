<h1>The End</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hello everyone! ^-^ This is a weird poem-like thing from Tomoyo&#39;s point
of view. It&#39;s kind of depressing, but I was crying when I wrote it, so
that&#39;s part of the reason. Anyway, I hope you like it. ^-^ Please tell
me what you think!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again, its time for things to come to a close.
This chapter is over, life moves on to the next.
I will never forget you, no matter the pages till the end.
We will always have this dream, no matter the roads ahead.

If that&#39;s the case, why I can&#39;t I bring myself to close this?
Why can&#39;t I agree that this time and place can now rest?
Through tear stained eyes, I shake my head,
Unwilling to say goodbye.
This may be the finale, our last duet,
But please let me pretend a last time that this is when we first
met once more.

There&#39;s so much I would tell you, so much I wish to show you in an
outpouring of my heart.
But I&#39;m too choked up with tears to utter a word.
No goodbye greets your sad eyes as you turn to leave.
I will forever regret that, I know now.
If only...

I&#39;m being torn in two, ripped in half.
This can&#39;t be the way things are meant to be.
How can I lose my other half now?
The missing piece of my soul, you complete me.
You&#39;re my better self.
But why must I be left alone weeping? Broken and half complete?

The cold courses through my body now,
As I watch your receding form.
Now I am truly alone once again.
I wonder if perhaps I was the dream, destined to be forgotten as such.
Or am I the dreamer?
Blessed with you as a beautiful dream.
Cursed to have that pulled from my grasp.

I stand paralyzed with fear.
Both for the new future and for the death of our cherished time
together.
Why can&#39;t we stay this way forever?
You don&#39;t have to go.
You and me, together we&#39;ll pretend that our melodies have first crossed
paths all over again.

Through my tears, I see your face.
Why do you tease me?
My lonely heart screams out silently, wishing you were near.
I&#39;d strangle you for leaving, kiss you for being there by my side
again.
Sparkles of my tears, no, my shattered dream trickle to the floor,
A crystalline pool of blood as my dream lay dying.
Why must the dreamer awake?
Just one more minute is all I ask.
One more minute with you...
