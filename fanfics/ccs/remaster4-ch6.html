<h1>Remastered IV (part 6 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster4-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Up until a few months ago Fight&#146;s life had been an endless war.

War against the world, war against her limitations (even if she was 
the personification of combat), war against her failings, and 
ultimately war against herself.

She trained endlessly, making herself perfect in her skills. Even at 
&#147;Rest&#148; in card form she went over her tactics and trainings in &#147;dream 
state&#148;.

Cards that &#147;dream&#148;. Separately they dream in their own private space, 
but in the book all together they dream in a mutual &#147;place&#148;. A place 
where relationships and friendships are forged.

It was in this space, this &#147;dreaming&#148; that Umi (Water) and Gaia 
(Woods) fostered a relationship. It was also in this space that Cloud 
and Kero kept their relationship going while he &#147;slept&#148; within the 
book.

Here, however, Fight was as much a loner as she was in the waking 
world. She would often keep to herself, though sometimes other cards 
would draw her out of her quiet training to interact with her. Still, 
to her the thought of needing a companion seemed a distant thing that 
only others indulged in.

That is, until she met him on that night which changed everything.

That night in the park changed her. She became more and more aware of 
her surroundings. At first she was intrigued by relationships, then 
desperate for companionship, the person who tried to save her being 
the one she wanted to be with the most.

Why? Maybe because he came to her rescue at great personal cost to 
himself. Maybe because he only thought of her even when he was being 
violated. Or -- maybe because for the first time in her life she 
needed someone to lean on, when even her great skill couldn&#146;t protect 
her from what happened to her that night -- or the pain that wracked 
her heart that no amount of fighting could defeat.

From that day he meant more and more to her, until she couldn&#146;t 
imagine living without him by her side.

The day she hurt him by accident was horrific for her. She stood by 
his side or nearby as they treated him at the hospital. She couldn&#146;t 
leave his side, the fear that he might slip away from her wound into 
her chest too deeply. She knew that she didn&#146;t want to lose him, and 
fought hard against the darkening depression and despair which loomed 
over her as she waited for word. Finally good news came, and he would 
recover -- but the incident had given her reason to change, hopefully 
for the better.

She didn&#146;t want her powers anymore. Fighting, it seemed, has lost it&#146;s 
meaning next to the new feelings that overwhelmed her. Once, as the 
previous year drew to conclusion, she even struck out against her 
former &#147;mistress&#148; to keep her powers -- but now all she wanted to do 
was be rid of them.

To that end she visited mistress Sakura, and asked her to remove her 
powers, but Sakura asked her to be patient and think things through.

To that end they decided to visit the hospital where her beloved was 
so she could ask him for advice.

And that is where we are -- now.

Pacifica Rim Hospital

The only thing Sakura could think of saying was that Fight should 
think about it.

Truth be told? She didn&#146;t know what to do. She was, after all, very 
concerned. And, yes, while it was very true that Sakura needed to seal 
Fight&#146;s power, she didn&#146;t want to do it for the wrong reasons. She 
felt that she wanted -- no, she needed Fight&#146;s blessings for it to be 
OK, even if it meant waiting a little while longer.

So, it was in this state of mind that Sakura, Tomoyo and Eve went with 
Fight so she could speak to her significant other and come to a 
decision on this. It was what she wanted to do the most.

The hospital grounds were beautiful. The huge sprawling complex that 
was the Pacifica Rim Hospital had three huge buildings which were the 
medical complexes and patient recovery center, with all three 
buildings in turn flanking a giant park in the center of the complex 
which was dubbed the Starlight Gardens. Here, patients and visitors 
alike took time to recover both physically and spiritually from what 
ailed them.

The patient recovery center was to one side of the huge park, and 
that&#146;s where Fight had to go. As the four crossed through the park, 
admiring the beautiful shade trees and lovely pond, Fight felt 
something was amiss. &#147;Something&#146;s wrong.&#148; she said, eyes glancing 
about nervously, &#147;Something&#146;s not right.&#148;

Suddenly something sped past the edge of her eyesight, barely catching 
her attention. Before she could spin about she felt a sharp pain as 
something impacted into her back sending her crashing to her knees. A 
second blow knocks her side over side into the ground, stunned. As 
Sakura and Tomoyo rush to her aid, a man in dark black armor steps out 
into the light and regards the group. &#147;So that&#146;s a Clow Card human.&#148; 
he said, glancing at her casually, &#147;Not impressed.&#148;

Fight suppressed her anger, and gritted her teeth painfully. He was 
not a threat to her yet and she didn&#146;t want to lash out without need. 
Her time she took to reflect dimmed her rash behavior and simmered her 
snapfire anger which would have had her at this thing&#146;s throat in an 
instant after he hit her.

Before Sakura could utter a single word the four of them found 
themselves surrounded by a half a dozen armored beings, each a perfect 
match for the first one that confronted them. &#147;Assassin Guilder&#146; 
Drones.&#148; Eve rasped, eyes glancing back and forth at the Drones as she 
knelt next to Sakura/Tomoyo to protect them. &#147;You must be Raptor 
Guild.&#148;

&#147;I guess so--&#148; the leader remarked idly, tapping the insignia of a 
leaping velociraptor on the left breastplate of his armor, &#147;I am 
Decauter. With Ravage &#147;dysfunctionally deactivated&#148; that makes me the 
new head of the Guild doesn&#146;t it. But, to the point, assassination is 
not the goal here today--&#148; (holds up hypo) &#147;-- simply DNA extraction.&#148; 
(two of the Drone units hauls Fight up onto her feet, holding her 
tight) &#147;I&#146;d be very interested in seeing the kind of tightly wound DNA 
you have in your body. And then I&#146;d like to see if any of that DNA 
rubbed off on your boytoy in the hospital--&#148;

&#147;Fight! Don&#146;t--&#148; Sakura&#146;s words fail her as two of the drones turn on 
her, Sakura instinctively moving between herself and Tomoyo to shield 
her. Fight glances over at Sakura, &#147;Don&#146;t, mistress, just stay there.&#148; 
she warned. Her eyes then moved back towards her captor, narrowing, 
&#147;Leave him be.&#148; she growled, struggling against her captors. Still, 
she was too dazed and stunned from the first attack, so she could 
offer only token resistance to her captors.

&#147;Just take what you want and leave us alone.&#148;

&#147;I wish it were that simple,&#148; Decauter said slowly, pacing back and 
forth slowly as he watched over her, &#147;but I&#146;m supposed to bring you 
back and not let you go until we figured out what makes you tick--&#148; 
(taps hypo) &#147;--even if it leaves you in a rather-- unreturnable 
condition. But then--&#148;

Fight cringed. She wanted to fight but -- she felt remorse and pain 
just from thinking of it. She couldn&#146;t stop thinking of him. She 
wanted to fight, but images of him crumpling to the ground holding his 
chest came to mind. She felt paralyzed by her own indecision. But if 
she died --

Just as they were about to take her away a soft sad music filled the 
air. The music was low, strummed on a guitar, and slowly grew as the 
player strummed the instrument with a almost methodical precision. At 
this a thin smile forms across Decauter&#146;s face, though no one can see 
it as he&#146;s wearing his armor&#146;s helmet. &#147;Hmph. It&#146;s about time.&#148; he 
muttered, quickly stepping back to survey the landscape about him. 
&#147;Everybody heads up! We have a &#147;Sailor Trooper&#148; in our midst.&#148;

&#147;What--?&#148; Fight groans, eyes narrowed as her rage built, yet simmered 
in her confused state. What were they talking about? As the others 
glanced about, someone cried out &#147;THERE!&#148;

With that, all gazes turned and fell on a young woman in blue/green. 
Her hair short and blue, her clothes a mix of blue and green colors 
from the long coat, to the shirt and pants, with only black boots and 
gloves to add accentuation to her wardrobe. In her hands she held a 
shiny steel guitar which she slowly strummed. Fight couldn&#146;t help but 
chuckle. If only her lover was here right now, because this so 
reminded her of her significant other&#146;s favorite old TV show.

Makomi, aka the Trooper Mercury, looked on with digust as she observed 
the situation.

&#147;So what does the Guild want with Clow Card DNA? It serves no 
practical use to the guild of killers.&#148; she slowly challenged, eyes 
locked firmly on Decauter. &#147;Well, traitor, that just so happens to be 
for me to know and you never to find out. Maybe we&#145;ll just take her 
boytoy and leave her behind.&#148; he goaded, which stoked the already 
raging fire in Fight&#146;s heart. But this time her rage built without 
stopping, and her strength shot up full force at the thought of them 
&#147;experimenting&#148; on him. She didn&#146;t mind. No matter what they did to 
her she would struggle to survive, and find her way back to him -- but 
if they worked on him, cut him up and -- it would kill her soul just 
as it would kill him body and soul.

Her eyes narrowed, fists clenched tightly, as she lowered her head and 
braced for her opening.

Meanwhile, as Tomoyo and Sakura looked on, the two combatants that 
were Makomi and Decauter braced themselves for battle. Sakura, 
uncertain what to do, stood her ground protecting Tomoyo as they 
watched. Eve also stood her ground, keeping an eye on Sakura/Tomoyo.

The drone troopers around them tensed, watching the blue haired woman 
to make the first move as she paced them. A few Drone units stood at 
stand-by mode with their &#147;hostage&#148; (Fight) held tightly, without 
realizing that she was about to turn the table on them.

When it happened, it was quick and it was rapid on both sides.

As Decauter drew his guns to fire at Makomi, she leaped into the air 
over the gunfire slamming down into the nearest Drone unit knocking it 
over. She then spun about whipping her leg upwards to catch the second 
charging unit, snapping it about and into the ground hard.

Watching her move, Decauter tried to pace her step for step, guns at 
the ready. Everytime he fired, she would get out of the way, rolling 
into a Drone while she was at it and taking it down. &#147;Idiots!&#148; 
Decauter screamed, &#147;Damn drone units are never as good as the original 
once they&#146;re cloned too far down the tech-line!&#148; Tomoyo looks over at 
Eve curiously, who smirks slightly, &#147;Drone units are only good when 
their wetware is copied from the original. Clones made from Prime 
Drones aren&#146;t as &#147;well-bred&#148; as the Prime Drones culled from the 
original Assassin.&#148;

As Decauter begins to fall back it turns, and is met with a sight that 
causes it to pause.

Fight yanks her arms loose from her &#147;captors&#148;, pulling her arm back, 
eyes burning with rage, before she lashes out shattering the arm of 
the nearest opponent and snapping it loose from the Drone unit to her 
left. She then spins about and proceeds to decapitate another Drone 
unit with one kick. Her fists shatter steel and armor, cloned flesh 
and metal bone. Her kicks rip and shatter. Her body moving swiftly yet 
in a terrible rage. Each move is light and fluidic, but filled with 
power which matches the anger boiling in the Clow girl. As the last of 
the drones fall to the wayside, Decauter examines it&#146;s options and 
decides retreat is better than cybernetic oblivion. It falls back, and 
escapes admists the chaos.

Her rage boiling over she drops onto her knees, pummeling her fists 
into another dead Drone unit, screaming until at last Sakura and 
Makomi drag the distraught Clow girl off, restraining her.

It takes her five minutes to recover, and suppress her anger -- but 
what was done was done.

These things awoke her old self again, but it was changed.

She wanted to fight. But not to better herself, or to lash out at the 
world.

She wanted to fight for the person she loved. For her once and 
(hopefully) present &#147;friends&#148; (the other Clow Cards). For her former 
mistress -- maybe even for herself in a way. She wanted to fight.

Though -- for now -- she&#146;d be content just to be with him again. For 
now.

----

&#147;I felt so useless---&#148; Sakura sighed, watching Fight talk to her 
significant other from a distance. &#147;I just froze -- just watching like 
that -- why did I --?&#148;

&#147;Fight needed to do that on her own.&#148; Tomoyo reassured her, drawing 
Sakura close. &#147;It was for the best.&#148;

&#147;I suppose. But--&#148;

Tomoyo&#146;s lips touched Sakura&#146;s, pressing firmly in a soft kiss 
silencing any further argument or self doubt from Sakura.

As for the young man in Fight&#146;s life? He was doing better. It took 
awhile but the doctors put him back together good as new and healed 
him up. As they prepared to release him for home treatment that she 
told him her decision. As always he supported her decisions, though he 
seemed worried. She smiled, and kissed him softly on the lips. For now 
it seems she was going to be with him -- but soon she would fight.

But without her Clow magic.

Sakura, stepping forward with hands shaking abit, held the sealing 
wand before Fight and asked again &#147;Is it OK? Can I---?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s fine, mistress. Please, it&#146;s what I --&#148; (smiles as she turns 
back towards her beloved) &#147;-- I mean what we want.&#148; (her gaze returns 
to Sakura) &#147;It&#146;s OK. Do it.&#148;

With that she raised her staff high and focused. &#147;Clow Card return 
your power to me -- and be free. Fight!&#148;

She snaps her arms forward, staff head coming down right in front of 
Fight as it&#146;s energy tendrils shoot out and enwrap her. In seconds her 
power is collected into card form, and returned to Sakura&#146;s hand.

One more down.

As the three leave the room, Fight curls up in her beloved&#146;s arms and 
allows him to rock the weary and worn girl in his arms before they 
left the hospital to go home together.

----

Meanwhile--- Trinity Towers.

The tech crew motioned for their guests to clear the platform, the 
lift elevator ready to lower the newly arrived shuttle down into the 
hangar bay below. But, just as they were walking to the entrance, one 
of them stopped. At that moment Power turned about and stared off into 
the distance. Seemingly there was no reason to do this, but something 
was wrong -- she felt it. Then it dawned on her.

&#147;Fight.&#148; she whispered. &#147;She gave up her power.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; the voice behind her called out, tapping her on the 
shoulder while trying to scream over the Tech Shuttle&#146;s engines. &#147;Are 
you alright? What did you say?&#148;

She turned, and nodded her head. &#147;No prob!&#148; she cried out, racing to 
stand next to TechoCrat and Quake as they waited for her near the 
entrance to the Tower.

The Guilds were meeting to discuss the recent appearance of Prime 
Drones on Terra.

Assassin Guild Meeting Chambers (Level 90)

The huge circular room sat several dozen. In the center of the room a 
huge circular table sat, surrounded by observers from all the guilds 
this is where the twelve Guild leaders sat. The trio of new arrivals 
sat in their designated section, after a little disagreement about the 
&#147;status&#148; of the young girl Power as a Guild Member. A few words from 
TechnoCrat to their Guild leader squelched that argument though. As 
they sat down, the lights dimmed and the chamber was bathed in blue 
light. As the light fell from the ceiling several dozen Guilders 
appeared (via holodeck system solid projections), as well as the 
twelve in the center. Those who merely wanted to observe, but not 
reveal their identities, appeared in the room as black &#147;shadowmen&#148; 
with no discernible features. About a dozen or so of the guests there 
were actually in the room, along with three guild leaders, as opposed 
to the rest who were there by &#147;proxy&#148; (holoimage).

As always, the first to start the meeting off was the rather vocal 
BloodStorm, who while having no leadership status was not one to mince 
words in either work or meetings.

&#147;I vote we kill the things and write their corpses off on our Galactic 
Taxes as work related expenses -- maybe salvage the remains and see if 
anything useful can be made out of them. Anyone else?&#148; (he asks, 
motioning for the room to speak as he glances about) &#147;We&#146;re here to 
figure that part out, BloodStorm,&#148; one of the Guild Leaders 
(Greymalkin) noted, &#147;If you would kindly be patient and wait---&#148;

&#147;If it&#146;s all the same to you I&#146;m just here for the free meal and the 
extra pay.&#148; he shot, looking already bored with the meeting. &#147;We&#146;re 
wasting time. If they are the menace your reports claim them to be, 
and thus sufficient reason for us to be here, then let&#146;s just kill 
them and get it over with. What is so hard in that?&#148;

&#147;Oh, so we should just kill them then. So---&#148; Greymalkin slowly 
baited, staring at BloodStorm as he spoke, &#147;where do you plan to start 
&#147;killing&#148; them anyway?&#148;

Silence reigned for abit, BloodStorm not moving, until finally 
Greymalkin felt comfortable enough to speak again. &#147;If there is no 
other arguments to continuing this meeting then let&#146;s get down to it. 
The first (and only) agenda is the Prime Drones and their appearance 
on Terra---&#148;

Suddenly his pager beeped, and he looked at it. Reading the message 
thrice before speaking.

&#147;The situation has suddenly taken a rather interesting turn.&#148;

&#147;How so?&#148; BloodStorm baited in turn, watching Greymalkin closely, &#147;It 
seems, if this is accurate, we&#146;re about to receive new players in this 
drama that is slowly unfolding --&#148;

----

Daidouji Estates -- later that day.

It was Tomoyo&#146;s turn to cook dinner. And, after the events of the day, 
she had worked up an appetite as she cooked with Fuu&#145;s help. Sakura, 
sitting nearby, watched the two women finish the meal. &#147;That looks 
good.&#148; she noted, looking abit anxious to eat.

&#147;It&#146;ll be dinner time soon, so why don&#146;t you ask Eve and Dawn to help 
you gather everyone for dinner? I--&#148;

Sakura, moving forward to peek, accidentally slips and falls into 
Tomoyo&#146;s back, her hand grasping about her waist and on her belly to 
steady herself. Quickly Sakura jumps back and gasps, &#147;SORRY! I---&#148;

Tomoyo stops what she&#146;s doing and looks down where Sakura touched her, 
and runs a hand across her stomach. Sakura, shaking a bit, watched 
Tomoyo as she ran two fingers across her stomach. She looks up at 
Sakura, and smiles, holding a hand out to draw her close. &#147;Come here.&#148;

As Sakura steps forward Tomoyo turns and grasps Sakura&#146;s hands from 
behind, drawing them about to touch her stomach as she leans back into 
Sakura&#146;s strong body. &#147;---it doesn&#146;t hurt to think of it anymore -- 
with all my heart I wish it was different --&#148;

&#147;But how can two girls have a baby? It&#146;s impossible even if --&#148; 
(Sakura shuts her mouth, eyes wide) &#147;--I&#146;M SORRY! I--&#148;

Tomoyo nodded her head, her hands gently folding over Sakura&#145;s holding 
them tight, &#147;Even if I wasn&#146;t sterile we could have found a way -- 
somehow. But now --&#148;

Sakura holds Tomoyo tight, &#147;I don&#146;t care.&#148; she cried, tears slowly 
trickling down her cheeks, &#147;I DON&#146;T CARE! Magic or no I&#146;m going to get 
pregnant with your BABY! I want you to be happy Tomo-chan! I--&#148;

Sakura&#146;s voice turns to a soft squeak as Tomoyo turns in her grasp. 
For a dark and scary moment Sakura almost expects an angry expression. 
However, as she turns to gaze at Sakura, her expression is one of 
bemusement and confusion, &#147;That&#146;s sweet, but maybe we should get 
married before we cross the deep ocean of the mechanics of making you 
pregnant -- even I&#146;m not sure how we can do that.&#148;

The two bump heads, sighing as they relish this closeness just for a 
few more seconds, Tomoyo&#146;s lips gently brushing away Sakura&#146;s tears. 
&#147;Don&#146;t cry. We&#146;ll make it all work out somehow -- I know we will.&#147;

At that Sakura nods her head, taking a few final seconds to soak in 
Tomoyo&#146;s love before leaving to get everyone for dinner. Tomoyo, 
returning to her cooking, picks up the wooden spoon and sighs. &#147;If 
only becoming pregnant was as simple as making a wish, Sakura-chan.&#148;

Keiko/Eve&#146;s room (guest room)

Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.

Keiko&#146;s fingers danced across the keyboard of her portable laptop, 
eyes looking cautiously left and right as she did so. It appears she 
was no longer alone in the room.

From behind her she heard a soft shuffling as the door slid quietly 
open, then closed without a sound.

The first thing she knew was that it couldn&#146;t have been Eve. She 
usually made it a point to announce her presence. It couldn&#146;t have 
been Nina either. Nina always tried to sneak up behind Keiko to spy on 
her, mostly to see if she was looking through porn sites. This person? 
This person seemed content to hide in the background without even 
trying to come closer to spy on her. The identity of the &#147;intruder&#148; 
seemed simple enough, Keiko rationalized in her mind, she just needed 
to speak her mind and see if it was true.

As she finished she hit the Enter icon on the screen with the clicker 
and waited. As she did, she sighed and motioned towards the far end of 
the room, &#147;It&#146;s bad manners to stand over there hiding from me. Come 
over here, Sakura.&#148; For a minute nothing happened, but at last she 
moved over where Keiko was. &#147;Don&#146;t tell me, let me guess -- dinner 
time?&#148;

Sakura nodded as she watched the screen, the information coming up.

ALLIANCE MEDICAL DATABASE

PROCEDURE (DEEPDIVE enabled)

Before Sakura could see more, Keiko quickly shut the screen off and 
turned towards her, &#147;It&#146;s also not police to spy on other people.&#148;

Sakura nodded her head dimly, and turned to walk away but stopped -- 
&#147;Is that about Tomoyo?&#148;

&#147;What if it is?&#148; Keiko answered, to which Sakura retorted &#147;---but---&#148;

Keiko sighs bitterly. &#147;Go stand over there and wait a second.&#148; 
(pointing to the far end of the room). As Sakura stood there, Keiko 
turned back and read the file. As she did she occasionally glanced at 
Sakura to make sure she kept her distance. As she finished she shut 
off the screen and turned around. &#147;There&#146;s no record of a malpractice 
in concerns of Tomoyo&#146;s abortion. All records indicate it was clean 
and orderly, but then again that could have falsified the records. 
That&#146;s why I did a DEEPDIVE search.&#148;

Sakura, leaning now against the wall (for fear of falling over) looked 
on with a dazed, confused look, &#147;?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a customized search engine I got from someone some years ago. 
DEEPDIVE does a thorough and detailed search on related files 
concerning whatever topic I bring up -- in this case the abortion.&#148;

Sakura, silently, watched and nodded her head.

&#147;Nothing. It didn&#146;t find anything out of the ordinary. It was as the 
file said, a fluke. A one in a million thing that nobody could have 
prepared for. It shocked the doctors and they didn&#146;t have enough time 
to compensate. They suppressed it because of a fear back then that the 
circa 2295 abortion procedure was going to get a bad rep while 
opponents fought against in Alliance Medical Council chambers. I&#146;m 
sorry---&#148;

Sakura seemed to rise abit, and then she nodded her head and stood 
straight as if abit of a burden was lifted. &#147;So it wasn&#146;t anyone&#146;s 
fault -- except --&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t think about it. What he did -- he had to answer for that -- 
wherever he went after he &#147;passed&#148; -- it&#146;s not your burden to bear. 
Now go on, I&#146;ll turn this off and meet you for dinner.&#148;

&#147;Ok.&#148; she whispered, smiling. As she exited the room, Keiko turned the 
computer back on and stared at the screen. On it was a Doctor&#146;s 
personal notation about procedure.

&#147;Abortion procedure done according to parent&#146;s wishes. Additionally, I 
performed the T7 sterilization procedure as well, understanding that 
it was Mrs. Daidouji&#146;s strict instructions that nobody be told of this 
and it was to go down as a &#147;fluke&#148;.&#148;

&#147;I am curious as to why a mother would sterilize her own daughter, but 
she didn&#146;t give any answers and, from what I understand, the large 
donation given to the hospital has dropped a veil of secrecy around 
her case. In such I am deleting all notations of the sterilization, 
replacing the few pieces used for procedure secretly, and using a 
Class-9 &#147;tapeworm&#148; virus to insure these notes are destroyed as per 
your instructions.&#148;

&#147;I hope she can sleep at night -- when I think of her wish she shared 
before going under the anesthesia I find it abit harder than usual to 
detach after what I did.&#148;

Keiko leans back in her chair, clasps her hands together, and ponders 
her next move.

Or, to be more precise, if there was a next move to be had.

She pulls her cellphone out and makes a call.

&#147;Yamanaka.&#148;

&#147;Keiko? It&#146;s me -- yeah --&#148; &#147;Keiko&#148; sighed, leaning back in her chair, 
&#147;Either my improv of you is flawless or people just don&#146;t know you as 
well as they think.&#148;

&#147;People just don&#146;t know me as well as they think. But keep your antics 
to yourself during dinner or Nina&#146;ll figure it out. So tell me 
something, Eve, you haven&#146;t done anything naughty in my body have 
you?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll tell you about it in bed tonight.&#148; she chided, her demeanor 
growing serious, &#147;I got the information you were looking for---&#148;

&#147;And?&#148;

&#147;Not over an open line. I&#146;ll tell you tonight.&#148;

As the phone disconnected, Keiko looked at it oddly, &#147;What did she 
find out?&#148;

The call to dinner got Keiko to put the cellphone, as well as any 
questions, aside for the time being.

-----

The next day Keiko rushed out the door, but not before making a snap 
decision.

She grabbed Sakura, and Tomoyo, and rushed them out the door with her.

It was Sunday, and Keiko made a commitment to a friend to help on 
something. But, while she was out, she was determined to make sure 
Sakura/Tomoyo could unwind after the events of the past few days.

It was a simple enough thing. Soon after dinner she spoke to Eve as 
she returned from &#147;The Tower&#148;.

As Keiko walked through the door back into her room that night, she 
noticed Eve by the phone looking rather tired. &#147;Hard day?&#148; she asked, 
to which Eve shook her head, &#147;Tell me your day and I&#146;ll tell you 
mine.&#148;

&#147;I had to sit in on a meeting for the Sailor girls at their HQ.&#148; Keiko 
noted, &#147;But you knew that because you sat in for me at home after the 
Hospital incident while I went to the meeting, remember?&#148;

&#147;How was dinner?&#148; Eve asked, looking at the package in Keiko&#146;s hand, 
&#147;Is that for me?&#148;

&#147;Dinner, as you no doubt suspected, was good. Of course anything 
Mako-chan makes is good. I even brought you some (even re-heated 
nothing beats Mako-chan&#146;s cooking -- except maybe Fuu who makes a mean 
set of dishes when she&#146;s making waves in the kitchen).&#148;

&#147;My hero.&#148; she smiles, kissing Keiko on the cheek as she accepts 
dinner. &#147;I wish I could say my day was better, but I&#146;m afraid I just 
got talked into something that --&#148;

&#147;What&#145;s wrong with Tomoyo?&#148;

&#147;Not out here in the open.&#148; As the two walk upstairs to the kitchen, 
Eve elaborates on a different problem. &#147;ChibiUsa just called me, by 
the way.&#148;

&#147;Your &#147;goddaughter-in-law&#148; right? So how is Hotaru, anyway? You saw 
her today, right?&#148;

&#147;Right.&#148; Eve sighed, feeling abit down. (* - For more on Eve&#146;s present 
perdictiment, read &#147;Sailor Moon Remastered&#148;)

&#147;So, what did Pinky want this time?&#148; Keiko asked, looking a little 
wary of what Eve was going to say next. &#147;She&#146;s going to an amusement 
park tomorrow with Hotaru and they wanted -- they wanted to take big 
Hotaru along. You know, my goddaughter.&#148;

&#147;Uh-huh.&#148;

&#147;Well,&#148; Eve fidgeted, &#147;Well I don&#146;t want the girls to go alone, but I 
have a SpellThrashers meeting I have to be at (work related to the 
CLAMP School incident) and I can&#146;t get away from it so I was wondering 
if--&#148;

&#147;I&#146;d be glad to chaperone for the two Hotarus and Pinky.&#148; Keiko 
smiled, kissing Eve on the forehead. &#147;All you had to do was ask.&#148;

Eve blushed, head lowered, &#147;Thank you.&#148; she whispered meekly. &#147;No 
problem. What are loved ones for? Now, what&#145;s with Tomoyo?&#148;

As the two entered the kitchen, she checked for anyone coming, closed 
the door, and gave Keiko the full scoop. As she stood there listening 
(Eve reheating dinner) she just couldn&#146;t believe it.

&#147;You&#146;re telling me that Sonomi STERILIZED her own child??&#147;

&#147;It seems that way from the nearly destroyed paper trail I tracked.&#147;

Keiko slides into a nearby chair as Eve sits down, shaking her head in 
dismay, &#147;Why! Why did she do that? It makes no sense at all. She&#146;s not 
that kind of parent!&#147;

&#147;Maybe it&#146;s for a different reason.&#148;

&#147;What reason?&#148; Keiko asked, looking up at Eve as she began to eat. 
&#147;Maybe she did it to protect her. Or to make sure this didn&#145;t happen 
again.&#148;

&#147;From what? Why did she -- oh no.&#148;

&#147;After all --&#148; Eve whispered, looking up from her food, &#147;How do two 
women make a baby if your of the old school of thought?&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t.&#148; Keiko concluded. &#147;The stupid bitch. Why did she -- oh 
goddess.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m afraid however that this is all just speculation.&#148; Eve remarked 
sadly, the food still tasting good despite the slight bitter taste in 
her mouth from the conversation. &#147;Only Sonomi knows for sure why she 
did it.&#148;

Keiko nods her head, &#147;Heaven help us all if Tomoyo ever finds out -- 
but now what?&#148;

&#147;There&#146;s nothing we can do. And even if we could get her to confess, 
then what good would it be?&#148;

Back to the present. The park was beautiful, everything looked fun and 
she only wanted Sakura and Tomoyo to forget. ChibiUsa and the other 
Hotaru didn&#146;t know a thing, and it was all for the best.

Still, as she sat by the older Hotaru she couldn&#146;t help but reflect on 
Eve&#146;s words from the night before.

&#147;Nothing can reverse what Sonomi has done. Even confession will not 
ease the pain of the rash decision she has made -- that&#146;s why maybe 
it&#146;s for the best that this secret remains a secret -- for now.&#148;

Still, Keiko did one good thing at least. After learning that the 
Sailor Soldiers were going to be fiddling around Assassin Guilder&#146; HQ 
today she made a few calls, spoke to a few inside contacts in the 
Guilds, and before she knew it the Sailor Soldiers had a meeting set 
up with an important Guild rep.

All in all she was making little progresses, here and there.

Sunday morning. A few hours ago. Sakura would probably not forget how 
it all began for some days to come -- even if she wanted to forget.

It was about five AM when she first woke. As she rolled over, her 
weary eyes glanced at Tomoyo&#146;s sleeping form, her face quiet and 
peaceful. As her fingers reached out to gently caress her soft 
features, she couldn&#146;t help but think back to her vow.

&#147;I&#146;ll find a way to keep my promise to you.&#148; she whispered softly, 
&#147;Somehow.&#148;

She fell back asleep abit, and had a strange dream. She dreamed she 
was with Li again, the day she made her decision that nearly cost her 
her best friend. Only this time -- &#147;Li, I can&#146;t go with you.&#148;

He did not say anything, he merely looked at her.

&#147;If I knew then -- what I know -- I mean if I knew NOW what I knew 
later -- I --&#148;

&#147;You wouldn&#146;t have gone to Hong Kong with me, even for a short time.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148; she cried, head lowered, &#147;B-but--- Tomoyo needs me -- I 
can&#146;t -- I can&#146;t leave her --&#148;

&#147;Sakura.&#148; Li softly whispers, placing two fingers on her lips as he 
sits her down. &#147;What&#146;s done is done. You can&#146;t change the events that 
have already transpired. What happened to Tomoyo isn&#146;t your fault -- 
and you were there, when she needed you the most, and haven&#146;t left her 
side since. You&#145;ve been a true friend, and an even truer lover to her. 
She couldn&#145;t have asked for a better soulmate than you.&#148; (smiles) &#147;And 
if that isn&#146;t the true measure of undying love then I don&#146;t know what 
is!&#148;

&#147;You seem diff--&#148;

Again she&#146;s shushed, but now it&#146;s Eliza and not Li.

&#147;Someday she&#146;ll understand -- I hope -- as to why things will happen 
the way they do. I hope she&#146;ll find it in her heart to forgive me -- 
someday.&#148;

&#147;B-but-- hooee!!! What&#146;s going on!!&#148;

She turns, and walks into Li&#146;s arms. &#147;I can&#146;t tell you.&#148;

&#147;BUT-- WAIT!!&#148;

She wakes up with a start, sweating abit. She looks up to find Keiko 
staring straight at her, straddled over her body. &#147;She&#146;s awake! Good. 
Sakura? I---&#148;

&#147;HOOEEEEE!!!&#148; she screams, rolling over knocking Keiko off of her. 
Keiko rolls backwards and falls off the bed. &#147;---ok, I was asking for 
that, wasn&#146;t I.&#148;

As Sakura rolled she realized Tomoyo was gone. She quickly looked 
about in a shock, only for her eyes to fall upon Tomoyo, dressed in 
her Sunday finest carrying her vidcamera filming Sakura.

&#147;You&#146;re sure full of energy today, Sakura-chan!&#148;

Sakura, looking up, then down, blushes. Her hands grabbing for sheets 
to cover her nude form. &#147;TOMO-CHAN!! (I&#146;m naked!!)&#148;

Tomoyo smiles, holding the video camera abit to one side (but still 
filming Sakura) &#147;It&#146;s only for our private collection, and you allowed 
me to film us making love so many times, I---&#148;

Sakura sighs, her face turning a deeper shade of red, &#147;Tomo-chan -- 
Keiko --?&#148; (motioning towards the 7th Judgment as she pulls herself 
out of her awkward position on the floor)

&#147;Oh, Keiko wants to take us to an amusement park today.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; Sakura sighs. &#147;Can I have breakfast?&#148;

&#147;Sure. Come on! Just get dressed and --&#148; (Sakura covers herself up 
more, looking like she was on the verge of tears) &#147;---sorry.&#148; (turns 
off camera) &#147;Can you wait outside, Keiko? Sakura-chan is abit shy this 
morning.&#148;

-----

Breakfast went by rather well, if not for the fact that Umi was 
passing by Sakura/Tomoyo&#146;s room when she woke up and heard the whole 
commotion from outside (spying as she was) so she couldn&#146;t help but 
kid with Sakura about being shy, which only made it worst for Sakura.

Getting out of the door (and away from Umi) made things better, and 
things just continued to look up as they reached the huge amusement 
park. Sakura, who started the morning flustered and embarrassed, was 
now having the time of her life. It&#146;s been awhile since she&#146;s been to 
an amusement park, so she was having the time of her life now, which 
was only made sweeter with Tomoyo being there with her. Getting Tomoyo 
to ride the coasters&#146; was no problem, mostly because she would cling 
onto Sakura and that thrilled her. She did, of course, have her 
headset vidcamera with her (given to her some adventures ago) which 
helped her record the rides without losing a single opportunity to 
cuddle close to Sakura for her own &#147;safety&#148;.

As for the others on this &#147;date&#148; though? The older Hotaru seemed as 
reluctant to ride the coasters as little Hotaru, but with two 
energetic and hard to say no personalities as ChibiUsa/Keiko staring 
them in the face they had no option but to go.

ChibiUsa was having the time of her life, since she was seemingly born 
for this kind of fun. Little Hotaru seemed to scream a lot, but only 
because she was getting into the fun of coasters after a few rides.

Keiko smiled, but seemed to grip the restraints a little too hard 
during drops. She didn&#146;t like coasters that much despite her earlier 
bravado. As for older Hotaru? She was having the time of her life, 
though only one thing could have made it better.

As for Sakura/Tomoyo? Sakura was having a blast, and so was Tomoyo in 
more ways than one. Rollercoasters were seemingly something of 
Sakura&#145;s boundless energetic nature to enjoy, but Tomoyo took off like 
a rocket to the biggest coaster in the park and wanted to ride it with 
Sakura. Of course there were the cuddles she got in, but it seemed 
that Tomoyo was, besides a fanatic with vidcameras, abit of a closet 
coaster&#145; junkie. Rollercoasters fascinated her, mostly because of the 
speed and blood pumping excitement of riding them. Of course, given 
the chance to say what her favorite things about rollercoasters was, 
it would be the chance to snuggle close to the one you love as your 
hearts race and hammer in each of your chests with each twist, spin 
and dive. The energy was fun, but the exciting closeness sold her on 
the theory that coaster-riding was a fun way to spend a day at an 
amusement park.

As they took a break, Sakura looked over at Tomoyo, face blushing abit 
as she asked the obvious question, &#147;I didn&#146;t know you liked 
rollercoasters so much! (If I knew that I would have invited you to 
more amusement parks when we were younger!)&#148;

Tomoyo, smiling abit, shook her head as she sipped her drink. &#147;I would 
have been too shy to have held you like I did today, and that&#146;s the 
true fun of coasters (I think).&#147;

&#147;Pwhee?&#147;

&#147;The closeness. Snuggled close to someone you love, hearts racing as 
you experience the thundering speed and thrills, yet safe in the 
knowledge that you&#146;ll be OK as long as the one you love the most holds 
you close. That&#146;s what I love about rollercoasters the most.&#147; (sighs) 
&#147;We should come here more often -- just the two of us --&#148;

&#147;But then we&#146;d be hogging all the fun up for ourselves!&#148; Sakura said 
in her honest way, causing Tomoyo to giggle abit, &#147;Sometimes a little 
selfishness is OK -- as long as it&#146;s for all the right reasons.&#147;

&#148;Pwhee?&#148; Sakura paled, uncertain what to say. So Tomoyo said it for 
her. &#147;It&#146;s OK to occasionally want to be alone, just the two of us -- 
don&#146;t you think? Even if I was in a room with a hundred thousand 
people in it, I would be so very alone if you weren&#146;t with me.&#147;

&#147;But I&#145;m not leaving you---!&#148; Sakura suddenly yelled, blushing, &#147;I 
don&#146;t want to---&#147; (fingers touch Sakura&#146;s lips) &#147;It&#146;s a silly thought 
from a worried girl who can&#146;t believe her dreams of happily ever after 
came true. Don&#146;t worry about it too much.&#147; Tomoyo chided softly, 
drawing Sakura close to kiss her with soft passion as their lips 
pressed close. For a few seconds they held this embrace, before Tomoyo 
leans back, &#147;I could spend eternity with you, Sakura-chan.&#148;

&#147;Won&#145;t we? I mean -- we won&#145;t die -- will we?&#148; she gasped, looking 
abit fidgety.

&#147;Well -- actually, you&#146;re right -- we WILL spend eternity together.&#147; 
(Tomoyo smiles) &#147;Silly me.&#147;

Tomoyo slowly puts her fingers under Sakura&#146;s chin, raising her gaze 
to meet her own. &#147;Sakura-chan --&#148; (silence) &#147;-- I can&#146;t wait to see 
how this came out on video!&#148;

Sakura nearly faints as Tomoyo turns and takes her camera (set up whle 
Sakura was eating a few minutes earlier) and checks the footage. &#147;OH 
IT&#146;S SO CUTE!!&#148; (Tomoyo holds the camera up admiring the footage) &#147;You 
look so handsome and beautiful! It&#146;s like watching a sweeping epic 
love story the way you hold me close and kiss me! You&#146;re so CUTE!!&#148;

Sakura, blushing like mad, looks down at her feet as they kick 
mindlessly, &#147;Tomo-chan---&#148;

-----

Meanwhile, at the Apartment of Li Syaoran

The knock at the door got Li&#146;s attention. He tore himself away from 
his studies and went to answer. There, on the other side much to his 
shock, was Eliza. Before he could stammer a reply she invited herself 
in. She was wearing casual clothes, with the only sign of her status 
as a SpellThrasher being her work belt which she wore as a belt to 
keep her skirt up.

&#147;Nice apartment. You really are quite the neat and tidy sort.&#148;

&#147;N-n-no --&#148; Li choked, looking about for a place to sit Eliza. She 
walked about, pulling a datapad from her belt pouch. &#147;Here&#146;s the 
latest reports from SpellThrasher HQ. I just got them and it&#146;ll be a 
day before it becomes general knowledge to all the Thrashers so I 
wanted to get it to you before you found out via your regular 
communiqu&eacute;s.&#148;

He takes the pad, and breezes over it as Eliza walks out of sight.

The notes were focused on possible sightings of &#147;Mimic&#148; on CLAMP 
School, and her activities there chasing after a mysterious thief 
called &#147;20 Faces&#148;.

The second part of the notes covered the recent appearance of Assassin 
Guilder&#146; Prime Drones and their possible link in the plot to recruit 
&#147;Clow Cards&#148; to fight on CLAMP School.

As he walked into his bedroom to pick up his mem-deck to record all 
this data down for future reference he spotted Eliza, sitting on his 
bed, holding the portrait her herself that he drew. Shocked he stood 
there dumbfounded staring at her. She smiled, put it back where she 
found it, and motioned for him to come closer. &#147;I guess we need to 
talk.&#148;

Gulping down hard, he sat down next to her, but words refused to come 
forth. He sat there, and mumbled and gasped abit.

That&#146;s when it happened.

The next thing he knew was that she was kissing him, and holding him 
tight. As she released him from his kiss she whispered &#147;I know what 
you&#146;ve been dreaming --&#148;

He blushed even more, and tried to apologize for something, but even 
he didn&#146;t know what. She kissed his ear and whispered &#147;-- and you&#146;re 
not alone.&#148;

His heart nearly stopped. She then backed away, smiled playfully, and 
offered to make him lunch.

He could only grunt a reply -- what happened then shocked him.

What may yet happen -- could only answer his deepest and most hidden 
dreams.

And become another girl&#146;s nightmares.
