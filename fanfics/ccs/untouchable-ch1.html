<h1>Untouchable Face</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/annalijse.html">Annalijse</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I think I&#146;m going for a walk now,
A little unsteady,
Don&#146;t want anybody to follow me . . .
. . . Except maybe you . . .

	Opening the note which Li Meiling had left me, I stifled a giggle.  
&quot;I&#146;m sorry for wetting your lap,&quot; it read.  Poor Meiling did love Li 
Syaoran, and had cried to no end when she had learned that he loved 
another.  She, like me, now only clung to the hope that his relationship 
with the girl he had chosen over her would work out.

	Kinomoto Sakura.  My Sakura-chan.

	I sat with Sakura in the park and waited for her to read her own 
letter from the friend who usually lived so far away, but had come for a 
visit only to hear the devastating news from Syaoran.  &quot;She said that I 
am as spacey as ever and perhaps I haven&#146;t noticed a lot of things 
around me!&quot; the girl exclaimed cheerily.

	There was nothing I would permit myself to say, only smile and 
allow the truth to sink deeply within me, hopefully never to be found.  
Sakura immediately went off into a very excited babble.

	Catching sight of Syaoran blushing furiously, I decided I might 
leave the still-gushing Sakura to him, in hopes that he might confess 
his love for her.  &quot;Gomen, Sakura-chan, but I believe I should go for a 
walk now,&quot; I said hurriedly, hoping my leave would alert the bright-red 
Syaoran, &quot;I will see you later today?&quot;

	Sakura sighed, &quot;Oh, but Tomoyo-chan, I&#146;m not sure I want to be 
alone now.  Syaoran-san is acting very strange!&quot;

	My smile widened, a way of dealing with the gentle pain of irony, 
&quot;Perhaps you will soon know why.&quot;  She gave me a confused stare as I 
left, allowing my features to fall as soon as I left her line of vision.

I could make you happy, you know,
If you weren&#146;t already . . .
I could do a lot of things,
And I do . . .

	The aforementioned walk broke into a run, a desperate need to 
separate myself from the situation.  The weather showed signs of 
changing soon.  There was a good thing on which to focus my energy.  I 
could look forward to the first snow, and seeing Sakura-chan, and 
getting the opportunity to make her a kawaii costume, and--

	It was no use.  My world revolved around Sakura.  Not a single 
seemingly unrelated thought could thrive without her.  And now Syaoran 
would confess to her and she would have someone to love her and she 
would no longer need me and perhaps I could finally see fit to end such 
a miserable existence.  The half-life which was unrequited love.

~~~

	&quot;Moshi-moshi?&quot; who else could it really be?

	&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

	&#145;What a slow learner I am!&#146; I thought disapprovingly as excitement 
built of its own accord within me.  &quot;Hello, Sakura-chan! Ogenki desu 
ka?&quot;

	&quot;Tomoyo-chan . . . Syaoran . . .&quot;  My breath caught.  &quot;He told me 
he loved me!&quot;

Tell you the truth, I prefer the worst of you,
Too bad you had to have a better half.
He&#146;s not really my type,
But I think you two are forever,
And I hate to say it, but you&#146;re perfect together.

	Detaching myself string by string from the situation at hand, I 
replied gaily and without hesitation, &quot;Oh?  How do you feel about him?&quot;

	Silence filled the phone for a brief time which seemed a great 
deal longer.  &quot;I don&#146;t know, Tomoyo-chan.  We&#146;ve always been enemies 
until lately . . . and frankly, I still don&#146;t know if I like him, much 
less love him!  Hoe, this is so confusing!  May I come over?&quot;

	More excitement, brimming within me despite everything, absolutely 
everything in reality.  &quot;Yes, Sakura-chan, I would love that!&quot;

	&quot;Arigatou, Tomoyo-chan!  Ja ne!&quot;

	&quot;Ja ne, Sakura-chan!&quot;

Fuck you,
And your untouchable face,
Fuck you,
For existing in the first place!
And who am I,
that I should be vying for your touch?
Who am I?
I bet you can&#146;t even tell me that much..

	&quot;Konichiwa, Sakura-chan!&quot; I ushered a very vexed Sakura inside and 
to my room.  It was upsetting to me as well, though I chose not to show 
it, that things were not working out for her.  If I were to let go, I 
wanted it to be to someone who made her happy.

	&quot;Oh, Tomoyo-chan, it&#146;s so confusing!&quot;  And think how she&#146;d be if I 
told her . . . &quot;I don&#146;t want to hurt Syaoran&#146;s feelings, but I&#146;m just 
not sure what else I can do!  What do you think, Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

	I smiled helplessly, &quot;It doesn&#146;t matter what I think, Sakura-chan.  
What matters to me is that you are happy.&quot;

	&quot;Oh, but it does matter, Tomoyo-chan, it does!&quot; Sakura gushed and 
I wished my heart would stop its relentless ascent to my throat, &quot;You 
always know what to do!&quot;  She clasped my hands and I could no longer 
breathe.

	&quot;In this case, Sakura-chan, you will have to find your own 
answer,&quot; I managed.  &quot;I know better than anyone that nobody can tell you 
whom your heart loves.&quot;

You know, I don&#146;t look forward to seeing you again,
You look like a photograph of yourself,
Taken from far, far away,
And I won&#146;t know what to do,
And I won&#146;t know what to say.

	My heart was all I had left to give her.  And what would she want 
with that?  Already, she was giving me one of those confused stares that 
said she thought I was strange for saying such things.

	When it had passed, however, the bewildered girl grasped my 
shoulders frantically and begged, &quot;Please, Tomoyo-chan!  Onegai shimasu, 
help me!&quot;

	My smile faded for the fist time in what seemed years.  It had 
probably faded for the first time in Sakura&#146;s line of vision.  What was 
left for me to do?  I couldn&#146;t give her much, after all.

	&quot;All I can give you,&quot; I sighed deeply, preparing myself with one 
last, fulfilling look at the one dearest to my heart, &quot;is another 
option.  It is not a good one, nor is it one which will help you, but--&quot;

	Sakura cut me off, a look of desperation gleaming in her eyes, 
&quot;Anything will help, Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

	&quot;Aishiteru, Sakura-chan,&quot; I said it with every ounce of my being, 
poured into it my lifelong devotion and all the love left within my 
heart until I was drained, as I had said similar things so many times 
before to unhearing ears.  Meling was correct in saying that Sakura 
missed a great deal of things around her.

What was I thinking?
What will I think of next?!
Where can I hide . . . ?

	Her eyes widened.

Fuck you,
And your untouchable face!

	No confusion, no anger, no misunderstanding lay within them.

Fuck you,
For existing in the first place!

	&quot;Oh, Tomoyo-chan!&quot; she cried, falling into very surprised arms in 
a state of relief I had never before seen in her.

And who am I,
That I should be vying for your touch?

	She seemed so unreal just then.  I expected the dream to end over 
and over again . . . but it never did.  Kinomoto Sakura, my Sakura-chan, 
my one true love was here with me, she was not questioning me.  She 
wasn&#146;t speaking at all, only laying in silent acceptance tinged briefly 
by muffled cries.

Who am I?
I bet you can&#146;t even tell me that much.

	The neverending smile sewn into my face over years and years of 
tense friendship with Sakura broke through with flourish and lustre 
grown alien to my soul of late.

Who am I?

	Did Sakura return my feelings?  She hadn&#146;t said anything, and I 
had no concrete evidence.  Not that it really mattered in such a fragile 
moment at this, but I couldn&#146;t restrain myself any longer.  With 
gentleness matched only by a summer breeze, I kissed her forehead   Her 
grasp tightened and green eyes sparkling with tears rose only slightly 
to meet mine.  &quot;Aishiteru, Tomoyo-chan!&quot;

Who am I?

	Who cares?
