<h1>As I Run</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/forever3330.html">Forever3330</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Breathing hard, feet hitting the ground in a steady rhythm, I run. 
Each step pushes me farther away-not just from the starting point of 
the race, but away from my reality, my confusion, my naivete-away from 
everything.

I shut my eyes for a split second, everything I know flashing through 
my mind and falling behind me into the wind.

Then, guiltily, I remember it all, pulling it back. I notice another 
runner pull ahead of me, and I stop, pulling in one breath, and sigh.

I&#146;m tired of running. Not just physically-emotionally. I can&#146;t run 
from myself anymore.

Now everyone is ahead of me&#133;But I can&#146;t run anymore. It only serves me 
as an escape.

I turn, and walk off the track into the forest of Sakura. My namesake&#133;

Soon enough I hear the cheers as the race finishes. And as I&#146;d 
expected, she comes.

&#147;Sakura-chan&#133;&#148; She says, concerned. I turn to face her, to look deep 
into those stormy blue eyes.

&#147;Tomoyo-chan&#133;&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; That beautiful voice flows out, directed at me once 
more.

&#147;I&#133;&#148; A sigh escapes my lips as a knot forms in myself. I cute through 
it, determined to say the words, to stop this endless race I play in, 
trying to outrun myself. &#147;I&#146;m tired of running Tomoyo.&#148;

She looks confused. &#147;What do you mean, Sakura-chan?&#148;

A sad smile is mine to share, so much like hers, I&#146;m sure. &#147;I love 
you.&#148;

&#147;I know.&#148; Her voice is barely above a whisper.

My eyes lock on hers. &#147;Then why&#133;?&#148;

Another sad smile, now hers. &#147;You had to accept whatever choice would 
make you happy.&#148;

&#147;Then what about you?&#148; My face, I know, is like a book to her, wide 
open to read.

&#147;Your happiness is the most important thing to me. Even if it killed 
me I would show you a smile. But you&#133;you chose me. Why?&#148;

&#147;I love you.&#148; I repeat. &#147;You are my &#145;special person&#146;. And I&#146;m tired of 
running from it. Aishiteru.&#148;

&#147;Aishiteru.&#148; We&#146;re both crying now.

And now I won&#146;t run.
