<a href="../ccs/kinkyworld-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>TOMOYO&#39;S SHOCKING CONFESSION. 

She helped Sakura up and embraced her tightly, her legs sticky with her 
nectar. The two of them fell over the back and onto the cushions of the 
couch, holding each other. 

&quot;I have something to confess to you too Sakura.&quot; Tomoyo said, looking 
deep into the Cardcaptors eyes. 

&quot;Before we told each other how we truly felt, do you remember the Tutor 
I had for a while?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I thought it was strange at the time, you were always so smart. I 
didn&#39;t think that you needed a Tutor.&quot; 

&quot;She wasn&#39;t really my Tutor.&quot; 

&quot;Huh? Then what was she?&quot; 

&quot;The week before she showed up, I was sick. Remember?&quot; 

&quot;Uh huh. You had the Chicken Pox. Right?&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; 

&quot;That week I had said some really terrible things to my mother and I was 
becoming very defiant towards her. She thought she could solve that by 
simply grounding me, even from school...and you. As the week went on I 
got even more defiant and rude to her. So she said that she was going to 
hire me a &quot;Special&quot; Tutor.&quot; 

&quot;So?&quot; Said Sakura. 

&quot;The next week when she arrived, my mother told me the truth. She wasn&#39;t 
a Tutor.&quot; 

&quot;What was she then?&quot; Sakura asked curiously. 

&quot;She was a Disciplinarian.&quot; 

&quot;A what?&quot;  

&quot;A Disciplinarian, A person who is hired by parents to Discipline their 
children.&quot; 

&quot;Woah! How come you never told me this before Tomoyo?&quot; 

&quot;I was scared to. I wasn&#39;t sure how you&#39;d react.&quot; 

&quot;So... What happened?&quot; 

&quot;As soon as she came over she was directed towards my room. My mother 
had told her to use any means at her disposal. She was very strict and 
kept a watchful eye over me. If I even made the slightest mistake in 
anything I did, I was punished. Severely.&quot; 

Sakura choked back her tears, &quot;How?&quot; She asked. 

Tomoyo replied: &quot;Spankings, and lots of them. At first, it started out 
with me being put over her knees and her spanking me fully clothed, 
then, after each infraction, each mistake, one layer of clothing was 
removed. Until one day I swore at her and made her angry.&quot; 

&quot;I will not tolerate swearing young lady!!&quot; 

&quot;That was the first time I ever thought of you while being punished.&quot; 

&quot;What did she do?&quot; Asked Sakura.  

&quot;She went and talked to my mother, then came back and sat down in the 
chair in my room.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve talked it over with your mother... We have decided that from now 
on, you will be spanked for everything bad you say or do no matter how 
big or how small, and you will be spanked on the bare bottom from now on 
too.&quot; 

&quot;At that moment, I knew. I knew that I would never again think only of 
the pain, I would think of you. Not spanking me like she did, but 
tenderly, lovingly.&quot; </pre>
