<h1>Dreams (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>She smiled gently as she ran a hand through the other girl&#39;s long blonde
hair. Bright aquamarine eyes looked deeply into beautiful violet ones as
if they were in a world all their own. She felt the other girl push a lock
of her dark brown hair away from her eyes.  She felt as if the other girl
could see right through her, as if she could see into the depths of her
soul. That feeling sent shivers through her, the feeling that the other
girl truly knew her better than she knew herself. They didn&#39;t need to say
anything. They both knew the other far too well to need any words right
now. She let out a contented sigh as those soft, sweet lips brushed
gently, almost cautiously against her own. How she longed to kiss her
lover deeply, passionately. But she could wait, and that was part of the
joy in this moment. The leisure of spending this time with her one true
love. It felt boundless, as if they weren&#39;t confined to this world or to
any other, a feeling that they could just bask in the glow of the others
warmth.

Bringing a hand up gingerly to the other girl&#39;s warm cheek, she tilted her
head to the side as if to ask &#39;You or I?&#39; Who was it to be this time? Who
would be the one to begin their endless dance again. Before she knew who
had begun this time, she felt the other girl&#39;s lush lips push against her
own. This time the kiss was longer, more drawn out, evoking a gasp from
her lover. She brought her hands to the sides of the other girl&#39;s head,
watching the other girl smile sweetly back at her. Her fingers slowly
moving across her lover&#39;s silky skin, she gently caressed her soft lips
with her own.

If her entire life had been leading up to one specific place, one specific
time, this would be it. But that was not the case. &#39;We&#39;ll be together, you
and I, no matter where fate leads.  No matter what path we take, we take
it together.&#39; Pouring her entire being into one kiss, she tried to convey
every feeling she was having to the blonde girl. The other girl matched
her point for point as they stood together, both needing the other to be
whole.

Kumiko stretched luxuriously, basking in the warm sunlight that filtered
through her bedroom window. She opened her blinds wide to let in the
coming day. She smiled at the sounds of the birds chirping outside her
window. She froze when she heard a groan coming from her bed. Turning
quickly, she caught sight of long blonde hair peeking out from beneath one
of Kumiko&#39;s pillows.

&quot;Turn off the light, okay?&quot; Megumi&#39;s tired voice sounded muffled from
underneath the pillow.

&quot;Megumi-chan? What are you doing here?&quot; Kumiko asked surprised.

&quot;You don&#39;t remember last night? I came over here late last night because I
wanted to see you and you told me not to go after that. I didn&#39;t.&quot;

Kumiko laughed. &quot;I thought it was a dream.&quot;

&quot;I never have dreams that nice.&quot; Megumi smiled sweetly over at the brown
haired girl, watching her try to adjust her pony tail.

&quot;Megumi-chan...&quot; Kumiko said quietly, crossing the few feet between them
with a couple steps.  Leaning down, she kissed the blonde girl for a few
blissful moments. &quot;You really better go before my parents catch you.&quot;

&quot;Kumi, what would be wrong with that? I like your parents. They&#39;re very
nice. I&#39;m sure they would be happy for you,&quot; Megumi said.

&quot;Yeah, maybe, but I still don&#39;t want them catching you in here,&quot; Kumiko
gestured to the bedroom around them.

A knock at the door startled both girls. &quot;Kumiko-chan, breakfast is ready,
dear. Hurry up before it gets cold,&quot; Kumiko&#39;s mother yelled.

&quot;Hai, mom. I&#39;ll be right there.&quot; Turning to Megumi, Kumiko pointed to her
closet. &quot;You can borrow one of my uniforms and I&#39;ll pack a lunch for you.&quot;

Megumi nodded. &quot;Thanks. Today&#39;s cheerleading practice, though.&quot;

Kumiko thought for a moment. &quot;You should have thought of that before you
came over,&quot;  she said, sticking out her tongue at the other girl. More
seriously, she began to think again. &quot;Could we stop off at your house on
the way to school to pick up your cheerleading uniform? You live close
enough that if we get going soon we should be able to make it in time.&quot;
Walking to her closet, Kumiko put her own cheerleading uniform in her
backpack.


Megumi smiled happily. &quot;Thanks, Kumi. I&#39;ll try to get ready quickly then.&quot;

&quot;Okay. See you in a minute.&quot; Giving the blonde girl a soft kiss on the
lips, Kumiko picked up her backpack and hurried out of the room.

&quot;There you are, Kumiko-chan,&quot; her father said as she walked into the
kitchen. &quot;We thought you&#39;d slept in.&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m up. I just had to finish some things before I was ready,&quot; Kumiko
explained, taking a bite of the fresh pancakes. They tasted marvelous, but
she didn&#39;t have the time to savor them. She made her way to the
refrigerator. Taking a brief look inside, she started grabbing food for
two lunches.

Her mother laughed when she looked over at her rushed daughter. &quot;You must
be hungry today.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m making lunch for Megumi-chan, too. Sometimes she forgets,&quot; Kumiko
said, wrapping some leftovers.

&quot;That girl&#39;s sweet. You&#39;re lucky to have a friend like that,&quot; her father
said.

&quot;Yeah. She&#39;s the best.&quot; Kumiko smiled. She almost dropped the lunch she
was making when she saw Megumi standing next to her mother in the kitchen.
&quot;Megumi-chan?&quot;

&quot;She was right outside. It looks like some people can wake up early,&quot; her
mother laughed while she ushered Megumi inside. Megumi just smiled and
waved to Kumiko. &quot;Would you like to stay for breakfast, Megumi?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;d love to, mom, but we&#39;ve got to get going. Thanks anyway!&quot; Taking a
hold of Megumi&#39;s arm, Kumiko headed for the door. Her parents sweatdropped
as they watched their daughter hurrying off.

&quot;Goodbye!! Arigato!&quot; Megumi said to Kumiko&#39;s parents before heading out
the door.

&quot;How&#39;d you get there?&quot; Kumiko asked as they started off towards Megumi&#39;s
house.

&quot;I climbed out your window and knocked on the front door. Your mother let
me in after that,&quot; Megumi smiled.

&quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking.&quot;

&quot;I like your parents. They&#39;re really nice,&quot; Megumi said.

&quot;So are yours.&quot; Kumiko smiled.

&quot;When they&#39;re home.&quot; Letting out a sigh, Megumi looked over at Kumiko.
&quot;Besides, I thought you said your parents liked me, too.&quot;

Kumiko laughed, brushing some hair out of her eyes. &quot;As another daughter,
yeah. You are over at our house enough to be.&quot;

&quot;See? Your parents should have started guessing with that.  And I&#39;m always
going places with you. When you and I are going places Friday nights, you
dress up for it. Last time there was a dance, your parents asked you for
over a week who you were going to go with but you kept saying you didn&#39;t
know until you wound up going with me as &#39;friends&#39;.&quot;  Turning to Kumiko,
she grinned. &quot;So maybe they already know. Or they have to have guessed a
few times.&quot;

&quot;Oh, stop it. That&#39;s not funny,&quot; Kumiko said. &quot;Anyway, we better hurry if
we want to get to your house and school on time.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

Starting to walk faster, Kumiko blinked as her eyes adjusted to the bright
day. &quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;For lunch. That was sweet of you,&quot; Megumi said happily.

&quot;That? Oh, that&#39;s alright.&quot; Kumiko winked at the blonde girl. &quot;Just make
sure you eat all of it.&quot;

Megumi giggled. &quot;Of course I will. You made it.&quot; Stopping in front of her
house, Megumi pulled out a house key and unlocked the door. &quot;Would you
like to come in, Kumi?&quot;

Kumiko looked at her watch nervously. &quot;No, that&#39;s okay. Just be quick.&quot;

Megumi nodded and headed swiftly into her house. A few moments later, she
came out the door, putting her cheerleader uniform in her backpack.

&quot;Is that everything?&quot; Kumiko asked worriedly as she took another glance at
her watch.

&quot;That should be.&quot; Grabbing Kumiko&#39;s arm just above the shoulder, Megumi
looked into her eyes.

&quot;Kumi, don&#39;t worry about it. If anything happens, we&#39;ll tell your parents
that it was my fault because I forgot something at home.&quot;

Kumiko shook her head. &quot;No, I wouldn&#39;t say anything like that. Let&#39;s just
try to get there on time.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot; Megumi made sure the door was locked before she and Kumiko started
running to school.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;So why did you both show up so late?&quot; Asahi asked, pulling on her shoes.
She was eager to get to cheerleading practice so she had dressed
hurriedly.

&quot;Oh... We...&quot; Kumiko started. She turned to Megumi and shrugged
helplessly. She busied herself with fixing her pony tail.

&quot;I was waiting to walk to school with Kumi, but by the time we were on our
way, I remembered I left my uniform at home.&quot; Megumi gestured to the
cheerleading uniform she was now wearing.

&quot;No wonder. Well, at least you got here. Chisa was betting you wouldn&#39;t
and Akari thought one of you was sick.&quot; Picking up her baton, Asahi
checked to make sure everything was perfect. &quot;But I thought Kumiko-chan
just wound up sleeping in again.&quot;

Megumi nodded. &quot;Kumi must have been tired after last night. I did want to
get up myself.&quot;  She smiled mischievously at the brown haired girl.

Kumiko blushed and nudged the blonde none too gently. &quot;Megumi-chan...&quot;

Megumi merely giggled and stepped to the side. &quot;Your cranky, Kumi. You
didn&#39;t sleep much last night, did you?&quot; She winked at Kumiko while their
friend looked on in confusion.

Before anyone could say another word, a woman in her early twenties
entered the room, her dark, shoulder length hair offsetting calm blue
eyes. &quot;You girls almost ready?&quot; She asked.

A faint blush spread over Asahi&#39;s cheeks. She clutched her baton tightly
and nodded.  &quot;Yes, Coachie.&quot;

The older woman smiled gently at Asahi. &quot;Good. I&#39;ll be waiting for you.&quot;
She paused for a moment before she turned to leave the room.

Asahi slowly let out a sigh. &quot;Coachie...&quot; she said dreamily. Without
looking back, she hurried after the other woman.

Kumiko turned to Megumi. &quot;That still frightens me.&quot;

Megumi shrugged, looking after their friend. &quot;Coach is really nice, and
Asahi&#39;s seemed to like her since the first day she showed up for gym
class. I&#39;m just wondering if they&#39;re going out or if Asahi-chan&#39;s still
pining away,&quot; the blonde girl said thoughtfully.

Kumiko eyes widened. &quot;Going out? But the coach is so much older than
Asahi-chan. Do you think they might be?&quot;

&quot;Maybe, I&#39;m not sure yet. And age doesn&#39;t matter, anyway, so that&#39;s not
important.&quot;

&quot;Well, if they&#39;re not together, I wish Asahi-chan luck,&quot; Kumiko said,
taking Megumi&#39;s hand in her own.

Megumi smiled. &quot;Me too. For now, we better get out there before they start
worrying about us.&quot;

Kumiko nodded agreement and the two girls headed outside.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;How did you do on the test, Kumi?&quot; Megumi asked as they walked vaguely
towards Kumiko&#39;s house. It was a beautiful cloudless day and they had the
whole weekend in front of them.

Kumiko slung her backpack on one shoulder. &quot;I did okay, I guess. It helps
that we studied for it. I wouldn&#39;t have been ready at all otherwise.&quot; She
rolled her aquamarine eyes. &quot;They could have at least tested us on
something we already knew.&quot;

&quot;We could try to study more next time,&quot; Megumi suggested.

Kumiko thought for a moment. &quot;No, that&#39;s alright. I did pretty well and
we&#39;d probably just get off track next time we study anyway, like we
usually do.&quot;

Megumi smiled at the other girl. &quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;

The two girls walked along for a few minutes, talking about this and that.
Megumi came to a halt when she spotted something. &quot;Hey, looks like they&#39;re
selling some antiques over there.&quot;

Kumiko turned to where Megumi&#39;s gaze led. &quot;See anything you want?&quot;

&quot;Maybe...&quot; The blonde said before walking over to the items spread before
them. The items were all set up in front of a large metal gate. Behind the
gate lay a rather impressive mansion. The sight of the mansion sent a
chill through both girls.

Kumiko rubbed her arms, the feeling she got from the house almost
physical. &quot;Can we go, Megumi-chan?&quot; She felt odd seeing that place.

&quot;In just a minute,&quot; Megumi said quietly. Many of these items, these
personal belongings of someone long gone, seemed familiar to her. Some she
could nearly remember. Try as she might, she couldn&#39;t stop the familiarity
she felt.

&quot;Cool! Megumi, look at this,&quot; Kumiko said, her gaze settling on a small
video camera.

&quot;Wow! It looks pretty old.&quot; Megumi walked over to the desk on which it
lay, side by side with Kumiko.

&quot;It would be great to have it, wouldn&#39;t it? I&#39;d love to record you with
it.&quot; Kumiko laughed as she picked it up, pretending to video tape Megumi.
The other girl giggled and posed for the video camera.

&quot;You girls find something you want?&quot; A girl around their age walked up to
them, seeming to come from nowhere. They had been so caught up in the
house and the items that they were both startled by her arrival.

Regaining her composure first, Kumiko turned. &quot;Yeah, we&#39;re interested in
this video camera. How much is it?&quot;

&quot;You are? No one else has even looked its way yet.&quot; The girl stood in
thought for a moment. &quot;If you want it, you can have it.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Megumi asked excitedly.

&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; the other girl smiled. &quot;My mom and I just moved in. We need
to get rid of some of the stuff that was already here.&quot;

&quot;Thanks!&quot; Kumiko said happily.

&quot;Don&#39;t mention it.&quot; The girl nodded to them before returning to watch over
the sale.

Kumiko grinned as she held up the video camera again. &quot;This should be
fun.&quot;

&quot;We have to see if it works first, though,&quot; Megumi pointed out.

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. I hope it does.&quot; Kumiko gave the video camera a quick
glance to make sure it looked like it was in working order. &quot;It looks like
whoever owned it took really good care of it.&quot;

&quot;We can check it out at my house.&quot; Megumi smiled at Kumiko and brushed
some of the other girl&#39;s dark brown hair away from her eyes.

&quot;Looks like there&#39;s still a video in it, too,&quot; Kumiko said, still toying
with the video camera.

&quot;Good. Now, let&#39;s go back to my house. This place is giving me the
creeps.&quot; Megumi took Kumiko&#39;s free hand with her own.

Kumiko waved to the girl who had given them the camera before they left.
Neither Kumiko nor Megumi understood the significance of the video camera
they held or the history it possessed. Both tried to push off the strange
feelings they&#39;d had while near the house as they got further and further
away from it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As they approached Megumi&#39;s house, Kumiko broke the silence that had been
following them ever since they left that scary mansion that had given them
such odd feelings of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.

&quot;This really is a cool camera, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Kumiko smiled excitedly, trying
to be patient and wait till they could see what was on the video tape.

&quot;I guess so, Kumi, but I don&#39;t see why you&#39;re so amazed with it. It&#39;s so
old. They probably don&#39;t even make tapes that are compatible with such an
old model video camera.&quot; Megumi sighed, trying to brush that scary feeling
she got from the mansion away.

&quot;Aww..&quot; Kumiko frowned. &quot;I&#39;m sure that they&#39;re sold somewhere.&quot;

Megumi giggled and leaned forward, lightly kissing Kumiko&#39;s lower lip.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m just a little shaken by the old building.&quot;

When they stepped inside, Kumiko noticed that Megumi&#39;s parents weren&#39;t
there. &quot;Where are your parents, Megumi?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re gone. Like usual. I don&#39;t see why you&#39;re surprised. They&#39;re
hardly ever here.&quot;  Megumi sighed, angrily.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, Megumi-chan. At least we have the place to
ourselves. And we can check out this video in peace,&quot; Kumiko smiled,
trying to cheer up her best friend, schoolmate, and girlfriend.

&quot;You know that the video&#39;s probably just an old empty tape left in by the
owner a long time ago and they never used it, right?&quot; Megumi tried to let
her down gently, noticing that Kumiko had such high hopes for the camera
and didn&#39;t want to crush them.

&quot;For some odd reason, I just know that there&#39;s something on that tape.
Like destiny&#39;s calling for me to watch it. Like there&#39;s something or
someone very important on it.&quot;  Kumiko shook her head trying to clear away
all of the overwhelming thoughts that rushed through her as she connected
the video camera to the television so they could view the contents of the
tape.

Megumi laughed, hugging Kumiko from behind. &quot;Kumi, its just an old tape.
Probably of someone&#39;s birthday or family.&quot;

&quot;What if its for us?&quot; Kumiko asked half seriously. She blushed when she
thought about how foolish that sounded. &quot;Well, I still want to see what
its about.&quot;

&quot;Want me to get some popcorn?&quot; Megumi asked, still smiling.

Kumiko sat down beside Megumi, pulling her legs up to her chest. She felt
the warmth of the other girl sitting next to her. She could smell the
sweet scent of Megumi&#39;s long, soft blonde hair as it brushed her cheek.
Smiling to Megumi, she received a brief kiss from the blonde before
returning her attention to the television. Her heartbeat quickened as the
video started.

Megumi sighed. She had an odd feeling about this. She wasn&#39;t sure she
wanted to see what was on the video. She felt that maybe, just maybe,
Kumiko had been right about the video being for them. That thought scared
her. What if it changed things? Maybe there were certain things they
weren&#39;t meant to know about.

The faint outline of a girl could be seen amidst the static as someone
tried to fix the camera so many years ago. After a short time, the
silhouette started to come into view. She was a girl about their age with
long dark hair and dark stormy blue eyes. Her skin was very pale, as if
made of alabaster. She seemed to have a perpetual smile that followed her
as she continued to check the camcorder. Both Megumi and Kumiko caught
their breath as they watched the dark haired girl on the video. A strange
sense of nostalgia filled the room. The dark haired girl winked at the
camcorder after she seemed fairly certain that it was working.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan,&quot; another girl called from off screen. &quot;You don&#39;t have to
worry about that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Sakura-chan. Its working now,&quot; Tomoyo said happily. The
camcorder turned suddenly, now being held by the dark haired girl. A girl
with short brown hair and large green eyes stood in view of the camcorder.
She was wearing the same school fuku Tomoyo was wearing.

Sakura sweatdropped and put a hand behind her head nervously. &quot;I just
meant that you don&#39;t have to videotape me right now, Tomoyo-chan. I&#39;m not
even doing anything interesting like card captoring right now.&quot;

Tomoyo&#39;s quiet voice spoke up warmly. &quot;Sakura-chan&#39;s always interesting.
You know there&#39;s nothing else I&#39;d rather videotape.&quot;

Sakura sighed in defeat. &quot;Okay. I just thought that we were going to go
for a walk.&quot;

&quot;We are,&quot; Tomoyo replied. &quot;I wanted a video to remember it by.&quot; Megumi&#39;s
hand absentmindedly went to her left cheek as she watched the events
unfold. This whole things seemed so familiar. She knew these girls. She
was sure she knew them.

Kumiko felt her breath catch in her chest. She felt like she was actually
there, watching everything as if it were through her own eyes rather than
the camcorder. As the two girls onscreen talked, Kumiko tried desperately
to remember what happened next. Remember?  How could she remember
something she&#39;d never seen?

The dark haired girl behind the camcorder giggled as she ran to catch up
with Sakura.  Sakura smiled brightly at her as she caught up. &quot;I don&#39;t
think I&#39;ll ever understand why you do that, Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

&quot;Because you are the most beautiful thing for me to record. Because you
are the most interesting thing for me to record. Because I love you,&quot;
Tomoyo explained.

Sakura smiled brighter and looked over at Tomoyo. &quot;I love you, too,
Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

&quot;Watch out...&quot; Megumi whispered. Tomoyo was too busy following Sakura with
the video camera to notice the tangled root in front of her. Her foot got
caught, throwing her off balance. The camcorder tumbled from her grasp,
but by now the images weren&#39;t needed. They both knew what happened. Sakura
looked on in alarm when she heard Tomoyo&#39;s gasp. She quickly lunged
forward, catching the dark haired girl around the waist and under an arm.
They both stumbled the rest of the way to the grass. The camcorder was on
its side, pointing at the two girls holding each other. Both were
breathing heavily from the shock. They looked at each other for a long
moment, passing a silent thank you between them. Ever so slowly they
leaned towards each other, their lips meeting passionately.

Kumiko gasped as the television turned off. For a moment she thought the
video was over, but looking up she could see Megumi had pressed the power
button on the television.  Megumi stood there silently, looking off into
the distance. She seemed to be thinking. Or maybe she didn&#39;t want to
think.

&quot;Tomoyo...&quot; Kumiko pleaded.

Megumi turned to the other girl, her eyes wide. &quot;Why did you call me
that?&quot;

&quot;Call you what?&quot; Kumiko asked nervously.

&quot;Tomoyo.&quot;

&quot;I meant... I didn&#39;t mean you, Megumi-chan. I was caught up in the video.&quot;
Kumiko tried to explain it away.

Megumi shook her head. &quot;You can&#39;t lie to me, Kumi. I know you too well.
Why did you call me that?&quot; She swallowed nervously. &#39;Please just say I
reminded you of her, or that you were daydreaming that was us. Anything.
I&#39;ll believe you, Kumi,&#39; Megumi thought to herself.

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know, Megumi-chan,&quot; Kumiko said softly.
