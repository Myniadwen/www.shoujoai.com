<i>Italic= Translated Lyrics</i></a><br><br>


Tomoyo was on her back from an important deal.  It has been successful and profitable, but even though she had become a 

shrewd businesswoman like her mother, there was something missing in her life.  It washer.  She felt regret like she did many 

times before and many times she told her herself, <i>Sakura-chan is happy with Li-kun.  There was no chance that you meant 

anything to her besides your friendship.</i></a> and they hadn't see each other in years, it was possible she had forgotten 

about her...<br><br>

She felt something wet hit her head and she looked up.  The clouds were dark and she heard rumbling.  Meaning yet another 

storm would come to Japan.  A raindrop fell next to her, and another and another until many fell from the sky.  Tomoyo dashed 

toward the nearest shelter, a building with a marquee, just before the rain began it came down hard. Harder then anything 

Tomoyo had seen before.<br><br>

<center><b>AH! tenki ame no machi de...</b></a>

</center><center><i>AH!  In the city where the rain falls...</i></a></center><br><br>

Tomoyo went up to the buildings door and tried to open it, but it was locked.  She swore and resumed looking at the rain.  It 

was coming down very hard now.  She could see her breath.  The streets were flooded in record time.  It would be suicide just 

being in this weather.  The marquee was huge and for some reason she was quite protected from the weather, minus the cold, 

which surrounded her.  She knew there was no way she could make it, so she sat and waited for the rain to stop.<br><br>

<center><b>Fuini guuzenn sure chigau...</b></a></center>


<center><i>Suddenly, we pass by chance...</i></a></center><br><br>

About an hour later, the rain still continued, showing no chance of stopping.  Tomoyo drew her coat closer to keep warm.  Her 

feet hurt from standing for so long.  Her heels were killing her.  No one else was seen.  It was like the world washed 

everyone away except for her.<br><br>Suddenly a figure crashed through the rain.  Her face was covered, so Tomoyo couldn't 

see it, but she was wearing a trench coat and had an umbrella, which tipped a revealing reddish hair.<br><br>

"Konnichiwa.” she greeted the stranger.<br><br>

"Konnichiwa", she replied back.<br><br>

<center><b>AH!  Mioboe no are shatsu...</b></a></center>

<center><i>AH!  I remember that shirt...</i></a></center><br><br>

The hair looked familiar, it was the same color as...  No, why did she have the same colored hair?  The painful memories 

suddenly flooded through her head.<br><br>

<i>Sakura is happy with Li.  There was no chance that you meant anything to her besides your friendship.</i></a><br><br>

It hurt, so much.  She'd be willing to risk the freezing rain, just to avoid these memories.  She was a coward, but she had 

always been a coward, because she couldn't tell Sakura how she felt.<br><br>

"Gomen.  I have to leave suddenly.” It was clumsy, but polite.  She didn't mean to be rude, but she couldn’t deal with this 

right now.  She hoped the women next to her would understand, but she wouldn't.  She had to face her.” The reason why I have 

to leave is because I made a mistake a long time ago.  I was just reminded of it.  Your hair, no, my cowardice, is the reason 

why I was going to run away."  “Oh?", said the voice behind the umbrella.” But I think I'll stay here and wait it out.  I was 

being rude." "I understand.", said the voice, "I suppose I was being rude to you by not showing my face."  She moved the 

umbrella down and Tomoyo's eyes widened.<br><br>

<center><b>masaka anatadanante...</b></a></center>

<center><i>Who could have believed it was you...</i></a></center><br><br>

"Sa...Sakura-chan..."<br><br>

"Konnichiwa."  Her voice was low.<br><br>

For the next few minutes, neither of them spoke.  The rain was pouring down heavy, making the only noise.  They just stood 

watching each other, then the rain.  It was a quiet moment, the rain, know matter how heavy it came down, made a gently 

noise, a comforting noise, like when you lie in a room and nothing disturbs you.  You just listen to the rain, and you’re at 

peace. <br><br>

Then Sakura spoke.<br><br>

<center><b>Sou...  Okubyou na watashi wa...</b></a></center>

<center><i>That cowardly person I am...</i></a></center><br><br>

"Was your cowardice was not being able to tell me how you felt?"<br><br>

Tomoyo's eyes widened.<br><br>

"I finally figured out what you meant, that you were in love with me. I understand how hard it is to tell people how you feel 

about them. It took me a while before I could confess my feelings to the one I love.<br><br>

"Sakura."<br><br>

"But you made sacrifices, didn't you?"<br><br>

<center><b>Jibuunn no kotoshika miyenakile...</b></a></center>
<center><i>I was only able to think of myself...</i></a></center><br><br>

"I was being selfish Tomoyo.  The costumes you made, your support for when I needed it the most, your love... All that and I 

didn't release your feelings.  I should of."<br><br>

"That's OK Sakura-chan, if I told you was in love with you...."  She released that she had added the chan prefix to Sakura's 

name again, but the other girl didn't notice.<br><br>

"Then you would think yourself as selfish?", she said cutting off Tomoyo. You were <i>far</i></a> from selfish.  You are the 

most kindest, most caring person I know.  You weren't being selfish Tomoyo. You were being yourself, but I didn't understand 

that at the time.  I was too naive to realize that".<br><br>

<center><b>itsuka anata no yashisa ni molare...</b></a></center>

<center><i>Someday, I was leaning against your kindness</i></a></center><br><br>

"I took your friendship for granted.  I leaned on you but I don't know if I was every there for you.” When I needed to talk, 

you were there for me.  When I was scared, you held my hand or comforted me when I was frightened."  <i>And you were so 

warm.</i></a><br><br>

<center><b>amaele ta yone...</b></a></center>

<center><i>I was being spoiled...</i></a></center><br><br>

"You did stuff for me, that no other person besides you would think of doing.  And you did it without
without asking anything of yourself.  I often wondered why, even thought often of doing something for
you, but you'd refuse.  I know you'd refuse, because doing it would be betraying who you were, but it
doesn't mean I was ungrateful."<br><br>

"I know.", Tomoyo replied.<br><br>

<center><b>kazoe kirenai yoru wo koete</b></a></center>

<center><i>Passing many nights that can't be counted...</i></a></center><br><br>

Both were quiet for the moment, letting only the rain surrounding them speak, maybe about the surrounding conversation 

between the two women, chatting excitedly about what would be said next.  After a few minutes, Sakura spoke again.<br><br>

"I hadn't forgotten about you Tomoyo, even while I was dating Syaoran.  I thought about you every night, every night I looked 

up at the stars and wondered what you were doing.  But then one night something happened, I found myself thinking about when 

you said "I love you."  I didn't understand what it meant then, but that night I released what it meant, and then I looked at 

myself, and who I was.  I didn't sleep that night."<br><br>

Tomoyo saw that there where rings around Sakura's eyes, and that she looked tired even though she tried to remain 

dignified.<br><br>

"But don't you have a good relationship with Li?", she hope that she wouldn't answer.<br><br>

She smiled.<br><br>

"It took me a long time to confess to Syaoran, but what if I confessed it to the wrong person?  What if the person I really 

loved was right in front of me.<br><br>

And suddenly it became quiet again, the rain chattered even more.  Tomoyo felt Sakura's lips touch hers and it was silent 

once again.  She closed her eyes and let it sink in.  <i>Sakura was kissing her!</i></a>  It was what she wanted to do, 

ever since they first met.<br><br>  The kiss was long, gentle, beautiful, just like here.<br><br>

<center><b>taisetsu na mono ni kizuita</b></a></center>
<center><i>I was able to figure out my most precious thing...</i></a></center><br><br>

She broke the kiss and then smiled.<br><br>

"Remember when shield was protecting your precious treasure.  It's you Tomoyo, my precious treasure is you.<br><br>

<center><b>Kiito kitto mou mayowanai</b></a></center>

<center><i>I'm sure I won't wonder about it anymore...</i></a></center><br><br>

"I love you Tomoyo.  I couldn't figure my feelings, but now I released them.  I love you.  Please don't deny your feelings 

any longer.<br><br>

Tomoyo smiled.<br><br>

"Sakura, I love you, I love you as much as when I met you.  I couldn't without you, to do so..."  Tears ran down her cheek.

Sakura wiped the tears from Tomoyo's eyes, and then they went into a long kiss, showing their true feelings for each 

other.<br><br>

<center><b>hitomi wa ima anata dake wo miteru!</b></a></center>

<center><i>My eyes are only looking at you!</i></a></center><br><br>

The rain had stopped, and the sun had resumed releasing warm rays of light up the city.  Sakura and Tomoyo had already parted 

ways.<br><br>

<i>"I have to get back to the office, but I'll see you tonight?"<br><br>

"I'm going to tell him."<br><br>

"It'll be hard."<br><br>

"I'll make him understand, I suspect that his feelings cooled a long while ago, and he's forcing himself so I'll be 

happy."<br><br>

"Li was always understanding, he just won't admit it."<br><br>

"Hey."<br><br>

"Yes."<br><br>

"I love you."<br><br>

"I love you too."<br><br></i></a>
