*thought*
&quot;dialog&quot;
&lt;...dream...&gt;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sakura hung up the phone. Those were the longest 2 minutes of her
life, she called Tomoyo and she couldn&#39;t believe what she was going to
do! It was a weird decision, even for her, but she was right about
that in certain way. So confusing...*That dream last night..could that
be another premonition? Did that dream help me to be so sure of my
decision?*

Kero-chan was very occupied playing his gameboy and making funny
noises while losing one more game. Trying to forget the defeat, he
looked to Sakura and smiled.

Kero-chan: &quot;Soooooo, didja talk to Tomoyo-chan? How&#39;s she doin?
Sakura: &quot;Fine, I guess..&quot;
Kero-chan: &quot;you GUESS?!&quot;
Sakura: &quot;Yeah, I haven&#39;t talked to her much.. I felt so weird..But
hey, we&#39;re gonna see her soon!&quot;
Kero-chan &quot;Yoookattttaaaaaa!! Sakura..Are you sure of what you&#39;re doing?&quot;
Sakura: &quot;Perhaps..I had this odd dream last night. There was a green
aura and it made me feel so well..This aura said weird stuff about me
and my feelings..&quot;
Kero-chan: &quot;You know how important your dreams are, Sakura..Has anyone
one this world made you feel so well as the aura?&quot;

Sakura closed her eyes in concentration for a few seconds.

..silence...

Sakura: &quot;SYAORAN-KUN??&quot; 
Kero-chan: &quot;Nanda?! That gaki?? Sakura, think more more MORE!!!&quot;
Sakura: &quot;Syaoran-kun!! That was him, I&#39;m sure of it!! I gotta dream
the same thing, I gotta talk to him one more time!!&quot;

Sakura got her key and it made it become a wand. 

Sakura: &quot;Sakura Card, obey my commands and make my thoughts
real...DREAM!&quot;


&lt;...................................&gt;

Sakura opened her eyes, it was all dark in that cold and negative
room. The floor was quite wet, but it didn&#39;t get her pink dress
dirty. As she tried to get the lonely thought out of her mind, she saw
a green aura and she felt the same warm feeling the last dream gave
her. It was coming closer, making Sakura feel safe.

Sakura: &quot;Syaoran-kun...&quot;

The aura became a person. The face, the green clothes, the hands, she
could see every little detail of the person so clear.

Syaoran: &quot;Hai..you finally found me, Sakura..&quot; with a smile on his face
Sakura: &quot;Why are you in my dreams? Why can&#39;t I find you anywhere??&quot;

Sakura looked at him with a desperate look

Syaoran: &quot;&#39;Cos I&#39;m not anywhere, Sakura..&quot;
Sakura: &quot;What do you mean by th..&quot; Syaoran places his finger on
Sakura&#39;s lips
Syaoran: &quot;It had to be this way. You can never change destiny,
Sakura. Did you realized why you stopped looking for me? I&#39;m not the
one for you, cherry blossom. Sooner or later you&#39;d find out. I&#39;m sad
it had to be this way, but now you can analyze everything that happens
in your heart. Think of the one who&#39;s always looking for your
happiness, the one you couldn&#39;t ever forget even looking for me your
whole life..That&#39;s all I have to say, Sakura. Goodbye, I&#39;ll always
love you.&quot;

Suddenly, the person disappeared and so did the aura. Sakura was in
shock, but wasn&#39;t sad at all. She closed her eyes *the one for me..my
true love..*

&lt;...................................&gt;

...She opened her eyes and there was Kero-chan, worried face.

Sakura was blushing, smiling, that was something Kero-chan hadn&#39;t seen
for years!

Sakura: &quot;Kero-chan, we&#39;re going back to Tomoeda NOW! HURRY UP!!&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

As the plane arrived in Tomoeda, Sakura looked around for the way out
of the airport. She looked around and smiled in discretion when she
realized that could remember all the ways in that huge place, the same
place she went to say goodbye to Eriol-kun and *..Syaoran..*. Sakura
stopped walking. She didn&#39;t feel sad. For the first time in eight
years, she wasn&#39;t a bit sad thinking of Syaoran-kun. Sakura smiled and
looked up, sighing in relief *arigatou, Syaoran-kun..Well, it&#39;s
time...&quot;* Sakura looked up and walked down the old Tomoeda streets.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

note: I know I&#39;m evil and I love being like this (=^-^=). The next
chapter will be the final one. Sakura will find out what happened to
Syaoran-kun and who&#39;s her true love. Oh and sorry for the bad
English..*shame*
