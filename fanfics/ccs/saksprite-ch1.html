<h1>Sakura and the Romatic Sprites</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/billk.html">Bill K.</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Special thanks to the Shoujo-Ai Forum for the inspiration for this 
story. 

------------------------------------------------------------ 

For those only familiar with the English dub:  

Sakura Kinomoto=Sakura Avalon 
TomoyMadison 
Shaoran=Lee 
Touya=Tory 
Yukito=Julian 
Rika=Rita 
Naoko=Nikki 
Chihara=Chelsea 
Yamazaki=Zachary 
Onii-chan = brother 
Oto-san = father 

------------------------------------------------------------ 	

&quot;I&#39;m home! Sakura called out.

No one responded.

Slightly disappointed, Sakura doffed her shoes, donned her house  
slippers and walked to the kitchen.  What she found shocked her.  	

&quot;Kero-chan!&quot; she roared indignantly.

Kero lay on the kitchen counter, his eyes glazed and his stomach  
painfully distended.  A spoon lay next to him and off to the left was 
an empty canister of pre-packaged cake frosting that had been full 
this  morning.  The beast didn&#39;t respond so much as groan.

&quot;Kero-chan, how could you?!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s easy,&quot; he groaned, holding his stomach.  &quot;You just stick the  
spoon in and . . .&quot;

&quot;You know what I mean!&quot;

&quot;Have mercy on me, Sakura,&quot; Kero wheezed.  &quot;I&#39;m already dying.&quot;

&quot;That frosting was for the cake I was going to bake for  Shaoran-kun!&quot;

&quot;So why does that brat deserve it over me?&quot;

&quot;And what if Oto-san came home and found you?&quot;

Unable to muster a response, Kero pointed to the blackboard.   Sakura 
looked.  Her father was still away at a seminar and Touya was  listed 
as having to work that evening.  Sakura was assigned to vacuum  the 
house and study.  Underneath, Touya had added &quot;monster practice&quot; to  
the list.

&quot;Ooh, that Touya,&quot; fumed Sakura.  &quot;Some day . . .&quot;

&quot;Carry me upstairs?&quot; Kero whimpered.

&quot;Lay there and suffer!&quot; Sakura scolded him.  &quot;Maybe it&#39;ll teach  you a 
lesson.&quot;

&quot;Sakuraaaaa!&quot; wailed Kero, but Sakura ignored him.

The vacuuming drowned out Kero&#39;s whining.  When she finished, he&#39;d  
stopped.  Grabbing her backpack, Sakura went upstairs to get some  
studying in before she fixed herself some supper.  Lost in thought, 
she  didn&#39;t notice the noises coming from her room until she was at 
the door.  Wide-eyed, Sakura pressed to the door and listened.

&quot;It sounds like something is moaning in there,&quot; Sakura thought.   &quot;It 
can&#39;t be Kero-chan.  He&#39;s still downstairs.&quot;  Feeling her chest  
tighten, Sakura summoned her star staff.  Swallowing, she reached for  
the door and silently eased it open a crack.  Taking a breath, she 
flung it open.

Her staff raised, Sakura leaped in - - and stared.  Her cheeks  
rapidly began to color.  Lying on her bed were the sprites from The  
Light and The Dark cards from her Sakura deck.  Their clothes were 
gone.  Their bodies were intertwined.  Light looked up from between 
Dark&#39;s  legs, her lips wet and shiny, and grew very embarrassed.

&quot;Light, dearest, why have you stopped . . .&quot; Dark began, pulling  her 
head up between Light&#39;s legs.  &quot;Oh!  M-Mistress!&quot;

&quot;Please forgive me!&quot; gasped Sakura, quickly averting her gaze.  &quot;I  
didn&#39;t mean to . . .!&quot;  Then she stopped.  &quot;Wait a minute!  How did 
you  two even get out of your cards?&quot;

&quot;Forgive us, Mistress,&quot; Light said, wafting off of Dark like a  
windblown milkweed and alighting on the floor before Sakura on her 
knees.   &quot;We should have demonstrated more restraint.&quot;

&quot;It was solely my idea,&quot; Dark confessed, kneeling next to Light.   &quot;I 
apologize, Mistress, for over-stepping my station.&quot;  She grimaced.   
&quot;It is just that my desire overtook my judgment.  It has been so long  
since I was able to be with my dearest Light.  And for so long I 
endured being so close in the deck to her, so close and yet only able 
to touch  back to front.&quot;  Dark squared her shoulders.  &quot;It does not 
excuse what  we did, Mistress.  But please blame only me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s OK,&quot; Sakura said timidly.  &quot;You just kind of startled me.   Are 
you two in love or something?&quot;

&quot;Very much so, Mistress,&quot; smiled Light.

&quot;She is the light of my life,&quot; added Dark wryly.

&quot;And our desire allowed us to manifest without your command.&quot;   Light 
smiled.  &quot;There is a magic other than yours that allows us to  
manifest ever so briefly,&quot; and she coyly glanced at Dark.

&quot;Well it&#39;s all right,&quot; Sakura smiled.  &quot;The last thing I want to  do 
is come between two, um, people - - who love each other.  Um, just be 
careful, huh?  Don&#39;t do it if Onii-chan or Oto-san are here, OK?&quot;

&quot;As you command, Mistress,&quot; bowed Dark.

&quot;We are very grateful for your understanding, Mistress,&quot; bowed  Light.

&quot;May we show our gratitude, Mistress?&quot; Dark requested.  There was  a 
twinkle in her eye that was lost on Sakura, but not on Light.

&quot;I guess,&quot; Sakura replied, puzzled.

The sprites floated up to her as one.  Dark leaned in from the  left, 
while Light leaned in from the right, and puckered.  Their lips  
pressed to Sakura&#39;s cheeks and the girl colored.  It was not a 
friendly  peck, either.  The kisses lingered.

&quot;Mistress, your skin is so soft,&quot; Dark whispered, her downy hands  
caressing the burning skin of Sakura&#39;s cheeks.  Dark&#39;s touch was like  
the cool breeze of night against her skin and Sakura couldn&#39;t help but  
respond to it.  This in itself alarmed her.

&quot;Oh, Mistress, you are so tense,&quot; Light purred and her velvety  hands 
began to massage Sakura&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;Please do not be so tense.  We 
are both your devoted servants, Mistress, and would never dream of  
harming you.&quot;  Light&#39;s touch was like the sun hitting her bare skin on 
a warm, sunny day.  Her hands worked magic on Sakura&#39;s shoulders and 
back.  The girl didn&#39;t understand what was happening, but she had to 
confess  that she did like it.

&quot;Mmm, you are very beautiful, Mistress,&quot; Dark breathed as she  began 
lightly kissing Sakura&#39;s throat.

&quot;I am?&quot; exhaled Sakura dreamily.

&quot;Release your tensions, Mistress,&quot; Light quietly exhorted.   &quot;Release 
your inhibitions.  Let yourself flow with the sensations you  feel.&quot;

&quot;But . . .&quot;

&quot;Allow us to carry you to new heights of satisfaction,&quot; Dark  
murmured, her lips pressing lightly to Sakura&#39;s breastbone.

&quot;Stop!&quot; Sakura said sharply, shaking herself from her lusty haze.   
Light and Dark both jumped back.  They knelt before her and bowed 
their  heads.  Instantly Sakura felt guilty.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry for snapping, 
but I  had to make you understand.  I appreciate that you&#39;re trying to 
make me  feel good, but I&#39;m not like that.&quot;

Dark smiled at Sakura with the wisdom of an elder.  	&quot;Mistress,&quot; 
she said gently, &quot;every girl is &#39;like that&#39;, if only  in the silence 
and anonymity of her own room.&quot;

&quot;The cards see you, Mistress,&quot; Light added softly.  &quot;They see the  
things you do, the places you touch at night when the lights are low 
and the sheets are high on your body, and Master Keroberos is asleep.&quot;   
Sakura blushed beet red.

&quot;It is no sin, Mistress,&quot; Dark continued.  &quot;It is nothing to be  
feared.  If none are harmed, pleasure is to be celebrated.&quot;  Dark took  
Sakura&#39;s hands in hers and pressed them earnestly together.  &quot;Please,  
Mistress, let us be your hands tonight.  Let us touch what your 
fingers  touch, caress what they caress.  Let us love you as you love 
yourself.&quot;

&quot;You will be most pleased, Mistress,&quot; Light added.  &quot;Upon our  lives.&quot;

Sakura grinned sheepishly.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to go that far.  It&#39;s  
just that it&#39;s so - - different.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes different can be better,&quot; Dark smirked.

&quot;And sometimes different can give one an appreciation of that  which 
pleased one initially, an appreciation that will be all the more  
intense,&quot; Light tacked on.

Sakura looked at them doubtfully.  &quot;What do I have to do?&quot;

&quot;Trust us,&quot; smiled Light.

&quot;Removing your clothes might help,&quot; Dark winked.

Clearly unsure, Sakura began to pull up her blouse.  Light glided  in 
behind her.

&quot;If it please you, Mistress,&quot; Light said, kissing her lightly on  the 
ear as she reached around from behind, &quot;allow me.&quot;

Sakura went limp as Light&#39;s hands slid the blouse up her torso and  
Light&#39;s lips slid down her neck.  She struggled to suppress a shiver 
as  the material eased over her head and the air tickled her budding 
breasts.   She swallowed as she felt Light&#39;s lips press to her spine 
at the base of her neck.  She sucked in air as she felt Dark&#39;s hands 
slide down her  waist to the waistband of her skirt, then ease the 
garment down her hips and legs.

&quot;Mistress,&quot; Dark cooed with devilish glee, &quot;your panties are so  
cute.&quot;  Sakura blushed again, drawing a smirk of delight from Dark and 
a mild look of reproach from Light.

Suddenly Sakura felt herself levitating up into the air.   Startled, 
she began to thrash until Light&#39;s caresses calmed her.  The  trio 
floated over to her bed and landed delicately on the mattress.   
Sakura&#39;s head and shoulders were nestled in Light&#39;s lap while Dark  
crouched between her legs.

Dark leaned in and took the waistband of Sakura&#39;s panties between  
each thumb and forefinger, while Light massaged the girl&#39;s temples.   
With deliberate care, Dark eased the panties down Sakura&#39;s hips.  As 
she revealed more and more of the soft abdomen, Dark would lean in and  
lovingly kiss it.  

&quot;Lose yourself, Mistress,&quot; Light cooed to her.  &quot;Let yourself  float 
freely on the waves we will inspire within you.&quot;

It was becoming harder to catch her breath.  Sakura sucked in air,  
only to expel it all the more quickly in order to suck in more.  She  
felt her insides tightening, particularly between her legs, and Dark  
hadn&#39;t even reached the important areas yet.  Was she actually going 
to  kiss it?  What would she feel when Dark&#39;s mouth got there?  And 
what  more would Dark do once she got down there?

But it was Light who drew the next response from her.  Unnoticed,  her 
hands had slipped down the girl&#39;s shoulders, then kept moving on  
down.  Her fingers cupped around Sakura&#39;s small, soft breasts.

&quot;Oh, the first bloom of womanhood,&quot; whispered Light as she softly  
caressed the small mounds topped with little rosebud nipples.  &quot;So 
soft  and fresh,&quot; she continued, then smiled as a memory returned, &quot;so  
suddenly sensitive.&quot;

Sakura&#39;s two front teeth pressed into her lower lip.  Her eyelids  
slammed closed.  Light&#39;s touch was so - - light.  It was like the time  
that she accidentally passed a sheer nylon scarf over her then topless  
form.  It was there, it was substantive, yet it was so gossamer sheer  
that it almost wasn&#39;t.

Then Dark began on her secret place, her newly discovered favorite  
spot on her body.  Using the same whisper-light touch her sister 
sprite  used, Dark caressed the lips of her sexuality and the regions 
around.   Her caresses were slow, leisurely, and ever so torturous.  
Every muscle  from Sakura&#39;s knees to her chest clenched.  A low moan 
escaped from her  throat.

&quot;It&#39;s maddening, isn&#39;t it Mistress?&quot; cooed Light.  &quot;You wish it to  
stop and yet you wish it to last for eternity.&quot;

&quot;It is torture,&quot; Dark added.  &quot;It is the exquisite torture.&quot;  Dark  
leaned in and kissed her on her lips.

Sakura&#39;s groan hiked up an octave when she felt that.  Encouraged,  
Dark leaned in again and began lapping.  Sakura&#39;s eyes popped open, 
then rapidly clamped shut again.  She&#39;d only felt what it was like to 
be  caressed with fingers before.  Now a cool wet tongue caressed her,  
alternating short strokes with long, fast with slow.  It was so  
different - - so intense - - so better.

Suddenly Sakura needed to do something with her hands.  She jabbed  
them up above her head, latching onto the sides of Light&#39;s hips.  
Light  continued to stroke her Mistress&#39;s nipples.  Sakura thrashed 
her head  back and forth in Light&#39;s lap.  It was too much.  It was too 
far too  soon.  She was afraid, afraid she couldn&#39;t take anymore, 
afraid it would be too much for her, afraid she would lose herself in 
the swirling  whirlpool her passions were at that point.  She wanted 
to scream, but  she forgot how.

&quot;Do not fight the sensations, Mistress,&quot; whispered Light.  &quot;Do not  
resist.  Feel the sensations.  Ride them.  Let them carry you away.  
Do  not be afraid.&quot;

Dark only smiled.  Then she penetrated with her fingers.

Her eyes ripping open, Sakura let out a strangled grunt.  She  tried 
to breathe again, but her diaphragm was paralyzed.  She gasped for air 
for several seconds before her ribs released and took some in.  Oh  
what she&#39;d missed, just because she&#39;d been too timid to go that final  
step.  She&#39;d thought about probing inside on those nights she&#39;d gotten  
the urge to investigate her secret place, but had never done it.  Oh,  
what you&#39;ve missed, timid little . . . ummmm . . .  	

Right - - Sakura.

&quot;Dark, you are so mischievous,&quot; Light said reproachfully.

&quot;I do not hear the Mistress complaining,&quot; Dark replied.

Light left the breasts and began running her fingertips up and  down 
Sakura&#39;s sternum.  Sakura&#39;s brain jumped from her groin to that.   It 
was different than when her breasts were massaged.  It was so  
delicate.  The sensation seemed to taunt her.  With her eyes still  
closed, Sakura didn&#39;t see Light lean in.  She pressed her mouth to  
Sakura&#39;s and the girl arched up to meet her, taking the opportunity to  
moan into Light&#39;s mouth.  It was a sweet release and she did it again  
and again, only quieting when Light&#39;s tongue began caressing hers.  
Her  hands came up and caught Light around the back of the neck, 
holding the  sprite in place as they kissed passionately.

With devilish glee, Dark moved her tongue up to her Mistress&#39;s  
clitoris.  She touched it, quickly jabbing it with the tip of her  
tongue, and Sakura squealed into Light&#39;s mouth.  Their lips parted at  
last and the girl continued to moan.  She was unconscious of doing it.   
She was unconscious of anything except the pleasurable sensations that  
had taken possession of her body.

Sakura&#39;s hips began to twitch.  Dark steadied them with her hands  and 
continued to worry the girl, intentionally grazing the clitoris from 
time to time, then moving back to other areas.  Sakura felt like she 
had a temperature of a thousand degrees.  She moaned.  She groaned.  
She  tried to thrash and failed.  She tried to escape and was 
thwarted.  She  begged.  She cried.  And through it all, Light 
continued to caress her  upper torso while Dark continued to lap at 
her lower regions.  Finally  it was all too much for her.  A warm 
gusher, like a friendly ocean wave, washed over her and Sakura emitted 
a sound that was a strange cross  between a strangled gasp and a deep 
moan from the depths of her chest.

Her lovers sat up on the bed.  Light continued to cradle Sakura in  
her lap as the girl curled up into a fetal ball, gasping hard and 
trying to smother the throb between her legs so it couldn&#39;t escape.  
Light  gently stroked the girl&#39;s hair, content to allow Sakura to 
float back to earth from her crest.

&quot;Did we please you, Mistress?&quot; Dark asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; gasped Sakura, her face still sweaty and her eyes still  
closed.  &quot;Thank you.  You can go now.&quot;

&quot;We are happy to serve, Mistress,&quot; Light said and softly kissed  
Sakura on the cheek.  They could see the smile on her face.

&quot;Thank you for allowing us to please you, Mistress,&quot; said Dark,  
kissing her in the same place.    

The two sprites joined hands, kissed each other warmly, and flew  back 
into the book.  Sakura remained curled up on the bed, feeling her  
heart pounding in her chest, wondering if she dared attempt such a  
summit again.

She didn&#39;t know for sure, but she was eager to try - - later.

------------------------------------------------------------

As she skated to school, Sakura made herself promise that she  
wouldn&#39;t tell anyone what had happened, especially Tomoyo.  There was  
really no way she could tell anyone else but Yue, Kero, Li or Tomoyo  
anyway and the prospect of any of them knowing what had happened 
struck  the young girl as the pinnacle of embarrassment.

&quot;Good morning, Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo said, smiling that warm,  sincere, 
genuine smile that made her so cute and so endearing a friend.

And before Sakura realized it, everything that happened came  tumbling 
out of her mouth.  It was like her tongue had suddenly declared 
independence from her.  Tomoyo listened intently, her expression  
mirroring growing shock.  But Sakura couldn&#39;t seem to stop until the  
story was finished.

&quot;Oh my goodness, Sakura-chan!&quot; Tomoyo gasped in horror, her hands  
covering her mouth.  &quot;That&#39;s - - that&#39;s terrible!  Oh my goodness, how  
could something like this happen!  It&#39;s so unfair!&quot;

&quot;T-Tomoyo-chan,&quot; Sakura said, trying to minimize things, &quot;it  wasn&#39;t 
that bad.  I-I kind of liked a lot of it.&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s a disaster!&quot; moaned Tomoyo, heartbroken.  &quot;Sakura-chan&#39;s  
first orgasm - - and I DIDN&#39;T GET TO FILM IT!&quot;

&quot;HOOO-EEEEEEE!&quot; groaned Sakura, losing her balance and crashing  from 
her skates.</pre>
