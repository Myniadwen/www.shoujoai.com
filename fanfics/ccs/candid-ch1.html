<h1>Candid Camera</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Ohayo, Sakura-chan!&quot; Tomoyo said happily, smiling at the other girl as
Sakura entered her room.

&quot;Hi, Tomoyo-chan,&quot; Sakura said as she set her backpack and her
rollerblades by Tomoyo&#39;s bed. Sakura looked curiously at Tomoyo. The dark
haired girl was setting up her video camera on a tripod. Sakura was a
little nervous. She didn&#39;t know what Tomoyo was doing, but earlier she
had agreed to go along with whatever it was the dark-haired girl was
planning.

Tomoyo was watching something while she was setting up. Sakura followed
Tomoyo&#39;s gaze. She was watching one of the tapes she&#39;d recorded of
Sakura. But this wasn&#39;t one of the videos of her as Card Captor Sakura.
It was normal Sakura on the screen, talking about her day and slowly
rollerblading along. She could hear Tomoyo&#39;s voice as well from behind
the camera.

Sakura sweatdropped and sat on the bed. She&#39;d always found it strange
that Tomoyo videotaped her, but Tomoyo just said that she was the most
beautiful thing to watch. It was flattering, but Sakura thought it was a
little weird nonetheless. Tomoyo had been videotaping her for years now,
but Sakura thought she&#39;d never get entirely used to it.

A young woman of fifteen, Tomoyo was no longer a little girl. Her long
dark hair reached down past the small of her back. The elegance and grace
she always had were still there in everything she did. Sakura shook
herself from her thoughts when Tomoyo turned around, her long hair
sweeping behind her. Her stormy green eyes lit up at the sight of her
love.

Sakura had grown as well. She had filled out rather nicely over the
years, turning many eyes her way. Her soft curves and her lean form
granted the young woman an almost hypnotic beauty, in which Tomoyo often
found herself getting lost.

Tomoyo sat down beside Sakura. She laid her hand atop Sakura&#39;s and smiled
gently at her brown-haired lover. &quot;I&#39;m really glad you could stay over
tonight.&quot;

&quot;Me too. I&#39;m glad your mom let me, even though she knows we&#39;re going out
and all,&quot; Sakura said, blushing a little as she looked at Tomoyo. Tomoyo
had been her best friend for the longest time, but now she was so much
more to Sakura.

&quot;Yes. She was really understanding about it when I asked her,&quot; Tomoyo
said, nodding.

&quot;That&#39;s good that she trusts us, then.&quot; Sakura smiled. Shortly after they
had started going out years ago, Sonomi had given them her blessing,
apparently very happy about her daughter&#39;s love life.

&quot;Especially since she isn&#39;t going to be here,&quot; Tomoyo said nervously. Her
mother had seemed to understand all too well. Tomoyo could still remember
the conspiratorial wink her mother had given her when she&#39;d talked about
being gone when Sakura was over. Sometimes Tomoyo thought that her mother
saw them as what could have been with herself and Nadeshiko.

&quot;Oh.....&quot; Sakura&#39;s blush deepened. She and Tomoyo had made love for the
first time about a month ago.
The idea of spending the night with the other girl brought up some vivid
memories. &quot;Umm... What about your bodyguards?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re still here,&quot; Tomoyo said, smiling reassuringly. She realized
Sakura was probably nervous.

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s good,&quot; Sakura said unconvincingly.

She&#39;d gotten to know Tomoyo&#39;s bodyguards pretty well after she started
going out with Tomoyo. It was embarrassing, but they often accompanied
the two girls on some of their dates to keep an eye on Tomoyo. They were
all really nice, if a little intimidating at times.

Sakura was snapped out of her thoughts by the feel of Tomoyo&#39;s hand on
her cheek. She turned to see the other girl gazing lovingly at her.
&quot;Aishiteru, Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo said happily.

Sakura smiled back at her. &quot;I love you too, Tomoyo-chan.&quot; The two girls
leaned closer. Sakura lost herself in Tomoyo&#39;s deep, dark blue eyes.
Their lips touched gently at first. Tomoyo&#39;s usually pale cheeks were
flushed as they kissed deeper. After what seemed an eternity, the two
girls pulled away. Tomoyo smiled happily as she sat next to Sakura. She
held the brown-haired girl&#39;s hand on her lap.

&quot;Tomoyo?&quot;

&quot;What, Sakura-chan?&quot; Tomoyo shook her head. She was a little dazed. She&#39;d
been thinking of many other quiet times spent with Sakura.

&quot;What exactly did you want to do? You were so excited about it when we
were on the phone.&quot; Sakura&#39;s curiosity had been gnawing at her since
she&#39;d gotten off the phone with Tomoyo earlier. The feeling had increased
when she had gotten to Tomoyo&#39;s house.

Tomoyo sat nervously. &quot;Well, I wanted to...&quot; The dark-haired girl sighed,
not knowing how to continue. &quot;I wanted to videotape us.&quot;

Sakura blinked. &quot;Sure. You do that all the time anyway.&quot; She smiled,
relieved that it hadn&#39;t been anything big.

&quot;No, I mean I want to videotape us making love,&quot; Tomoyo finally said.

Sakura blushed deeply as she stared at the other girl. It was already
strange for her when Tomoyo videotaped her, but this? &quot;But.. but its such
a private thing.&quot;

&quot;So is you&#39;re being Card Captor Sakura and I videotape that,&quot; Tomoyo
pointed out. &quot;And I&#39;m the only one who watches the videos, so no one else
sees them.&quot;

&quot;But why?&quot; Sakura asked

This time it was Tomoyo&#39;s turn to blush. &quot;I just think it would be
interesting.&quot;

Sakura looked at her more intently. &quot;Is that it?&quot; she prodded.

Tomoyo sighed. &quot;I really love videotaping you and when I got to thinking
about it, I had videos of you doing just about everything. I really
wanted one of us, though. I really wanted to capture this on video. I
love being able to record what you do and being able to catch a moment
with you on video has been stuck in my mind for a while now.&quot;

&quot;Like me wearing the costumes you make in bed?&quot; Sakura asked. Tomoyo just
nodded. &quot;I don&#39;t know, Tomoyo,&quot; she said uneasily. Their love life
certainly wasn&#39;t boring, but Sakura was still a little shy about these
things.

&quot;Please, Sakura-chan?&quot; Tomoyo pleaded.

After a moment of silence Sakura answered. &quot;Okay, Tomoyo-chan. I&#39;m still
not so sure about this.&quot;

Tomoyo smiled happily. &quot;Thank you, Sakura-chan.&quot; She kissed the lighter
haired girl briefly before getting up to check the video camera on its
tripod.

&quot;I don&#39;t have to wear a costume do I?&quot; Sakura asked wearily.

Tomoyo&#39;s eyes lit up for a second as she thought about it. &quot;That would be
great, but I don&#39;t think I have a costume ready yet.&quot;

Sakura sweatdropped. As she watched her girlfriend try to get the camera
positioned correctly, she thought about all the times when they were
younger when Tomoyo used to videotape her. How Tomoyo had always tried to
record her adventures as Card Captor Sakura. And even when she wasn&#39;t,
the dark-haired girl would often follow her around with her video camera.
`By now,&#39; she thought to herself, `I should be used to her recording me.
But then again, I never imagined I&#39;d fall in love with her either, so
maybe her filming us isn&#39;t quite the same thing after all.&#39;

Tomoyo took one last look through the camera lens before standing up.
&quot;There. That should be it.&quot; She hugged the other girl warmly. &quot;Thanks
again, Sakura-chan.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t mention it,&quot; Sakura said. `How did I let her talk me into this?&#39;
She asked herself.

Tomoyo sat down next to Sakura on the bed. Sakura stared at her for a
minute nervously. She tried not to look at the camera. That only made her
feel more nervous. She knew only Tomoyo would see the video so she didn&#39;t
know why she was so worried. She tried to concentrate on Tomoyo, but the
butterflies in her stomach only seemed to get worse. She waited for the
dark haired girl to say something, but Tomoyo seemed content to just
watch her. &quot;What now?&quot; Sakura finally asked.

Tomoyo thought about it for a second. She got up to change the camera&#39;s
position a last time. &quot;You could take off your clothes while I finish
this,&quot; she suggested.

Sakura turned around before starting to shyly unbutton her shirt. When
she finished she turned around to see Tomoyo standing behind her wearing
nothing but a smile. Sakura blushed as she looked at Tomoyo&#39;s creamy
white skin.

&quot;You&#39;re so cute, Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo smiled warmly as she crawled up
next to Sakura. She started pulling Sakura&#39;s shirt off, leaving the other
girl&#39;s bare shoulders exposed at first. She finally had Sakura&#39;s shirt
off while Sakura unzipped her skirt before sliding it off. Sakura&#39;s blush
deepened as she sat clad only in her undergarments. She felt Tomoyo&#39;s
hand on her own and turned to the other girl. Tomoyo kissed Sakura softly
at first. Sakura felt her heart beating quickly as she kissed back. The
kiss hit Sakura like a tidal wave. Emotions flooded her as the soft kiss
grew between them. It felt as if her whole life had led up to this point.
The nervousness started fading in her mind. This was right. The camera
didn&#39;t matter. Being in Tomoyo&#39;s arms, here with her, that mattered.

Sakura heard the girl she loved moan gently as she placed a hand on her
bare breast. Tomoyo started unclasping Sakura&#39;s bra as they kissed. The
two finally separated, gasping for air.

&quot;Sakura-chan...&quot; Tomoyo sighed happily. Her hand stroked Sakura&#39;s warm,
flushed cheek before drawing her closer for another kiss. The two girls
embraced tightly. Sakura was surprised to feel Tomoyo&#39;s breasts press
against hers. The sensation of the other girl&#39;s flesh against her own was
invigorating. She kissed Tomoyo back passionately as she pushed her back
on the bed. The camera was by now long forgotten in her mind. The room
was filled with soft moans as both girls&#39; hands started roaming the
other&#39;s body. Sakura delighted at the sounds coming from Tomoyo as her
hands passed over Tomoyo&#39;s sensitive womanhood before heading back up
along her stomach. Sakura&#39;s coos counterpointed them as Tomoyo&#39;s gently
caressed Sakura&#39;s firm breasts. Their hands continued moving, exploring
the soft curves of the other. Their lips met again and again as they
continued their passionate dance.

Tomoyo was in heaven. She never felt more alive than when she was with
Sakura, wherever that may be. She was happy just being around the other
girl. Feeling Sakura&#39;s body against her own played havoc on her senses.
The sweet smell of her short hair, the wonderful taste of her lips, the
sounds she could hear from Sakura&#39;s beautiful voice, her soft touch, and
the perfect sight of the other girl looking back at her with those big
green eyes.

Sakura ran her hand through Tomoyo&#39;s long, dark hair and then down along
Tomoyo&#39;s smooth back. She felt Tomoyo&#39;s hand slide into her panties, past
her light brown curls. She moaned the other girl&#39;s name as Tomoyo started
rubbing Sakura&#39;s entrance. Sakura whimpered when Tomoyo started slowing
down before heading up again. &quot;Tomoyo....&quot; She said breathlessly, craving
the dark haired girl&#39;s soft touch. Tomoyo&#39;s fingers hooked Sakura&#39;s
panties and slid them down past her legs. Sakura&#39;s now bare legs spread
out in front of her. The sight of Tomoyo sitting there long hair flowing
across her shoulders left Sakura breathless.

Tomoyo shifted on top of Sakura and moved so her legs were on either side
of the other girl&#39;s face. She gently pushed Sakura&#39;s legs apart and
leaned down, enjoying the musky sent. Sakura shuddered as she felt
Tomoyo&#39;s warm breath against her sensitive skin. Tomoyo moved closer,
gasping when she felt Sakura&#39;s tongue flick across her nether lips.
Sakura waited in anticipation for Tomoyo, still feeling the other girl&#39;s
breath against her. She moved her legs farther apart as she waited.
Finally she felt Tomoyo&#39;s finger gently tracing her entrance. She moaned
at the feeling. She went back to what she&#39;d been doing, her tongue gently
moving over Tomoyo&#39;s womanhood.

Tomoyo used her free hand to spread Sakura&#39;s petals, supporting herself
with the other hand. Sakura squirmed under her. She smiled as she leaned
forward, tasting Sakura. It was intoxicating to her. Every little
movement Sakura made reverberated through Tomoyo&#39;s being. Every sound
brought a smile to her lips.

&quot;Tomoyo...&quot; Sakura vaguely heard herself say, lost in the moment. Her
tongue pushed into Tomoyo, her passion filled mind spurring her on. The
moans of the two lovers mingled in the quiet room. Sakura felt the
feelings within her build as Tomoyo&#39;s tongue stroked against her pearl.
Tomoyo brushed against it again and again with her tongue before her lips
closed around the tiny nub. &quot;Tomoyo-chan... Yes, Tomoyo-chan,&quot; Sakura
moaned as Tomoyo suckled on her pearl. Sakura&#39;s head moved back between
Tomoyo&#39;s legs, a voice in the back of her mind telling her to keep it up,
that it was almost done. She tried to concentrate as the waves of heat
passed through her body.

Tomoyo shifted her legs as she felt Sakura&#39;s tongue inside her again.
This feeling of utter bliss encompassed her. She wouldn&#39;t last much
longer. She felt Sakura squirming under her again, moaning softly. Both
girls were close to climax. Tomoyo placed a hand on Sakura&#39;s thigh, the
soft skin enticing her to continue. Sakura moaned one last time before
her muscles contracted. She took a shuddering breath as she reached
orgasm. Her world was set on fire for one brief moment. She closed her
eyes tightly, her world dissolving around her as she floated on a hazy
cloud of pleasure. She barely remembered to keep up her pace with Tomoyo,
wanting the other girl to reach the little piece of heaven as well.

Tomoyo arched her back as the sensations spread through her whole body.
She panted, her heart racing as she neared her own climax. Her breathing
quickened as every muscle in her body seemed to tense up. It was all too
much for her. Sakura&#39;s body moving beneath her, the warmth growing
between her legs that the other girl tended to, the small sounds they
both made, mixing together. The feelings of love and passion rushing
between the two girls. It quickly built up for Tomoyo. &quot;Sakura-chan!&quot; She
got out before she was rocked by her own orgasm. As the sudden crashing
wave slowly wore off, she rolled off of Sakura and curled up beside her.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan,&quot; Sakura whispered breathlessly. Her fingers lovingly traced
the dark haired girl&#39;s lips. She rolled on top of Tomoyo. She moved so
she could see Tomoyo&#39;s face, and look into those beautiful eyes. She
kissed the other girl as she lay on top of her. What had she been so
worried about to begin with? She tried to think, but nothing came to
mind. She yawned as Tomoyo&#39;s arms wrapped around her. Right now, she just
wanted to lie there. She didn&#39;t want to think or to move. Just lie there
with Tomoyo.

Tomoyo smiled softly and kissed Sakura&#39;s forehead as they lay on the bed.
Her long dark hair draped across her upper body. Her head gently nuzzled
Sakura&#39;s neck as they started to slip off to sleep. A soft warm glow
filled the two of them.

Sakura woke up to the sound of moaning. She blushed and sat up, looking
around nervously. She saw Tomoyo and herself in the midst of their love
making. Tomoyo was playing it back again from the video.

&quot;Tomoyo!&quot; Sakura hit the other girl with a pillow. The dark haired girl
laughed and leaned against Sakura.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Do you have to watch that now?&quot; Sakura asked, blushing. It was strange
seeing everything happen all over again on the screen. Her blush reddened
as she watched the events unfold. She turned to Tomoyo and noticed the
other girl was entranced by the video. Sakura sweatdropped.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; The dark haired girl asked after a moment.

&quot;Are you happy now?&quot; Sakura looked down at the bed when she heard herself
call Tomoyo&#39;s name in the middle of it all.

Tomoyo nodded and smiled brightly. &quot;Thank you, Sakura-chan.&quot;

Sakura smiled a bit herself. She did love the intimate moments she spent
with her love, and she did make Tomoyo happy. So maybe it wasn&#39;t so bad
after all. All&#39;s well that ends well. Her smile grew as she looked over
at Tomoyo. She saw Tomoyo looking at something behind her. She slowly
craned her neck around to see what it was. One of the battle costumes
Tomoyo made for her lay unused on the dark haired girl&#39;s desk. Sakura
turned quickly to see Tomoyo still looking at the costume and thinking
about something. &quot;Tomoyo-chan...&quot; Sakura said wearily.

Tomoyo smiled again and tilted her head to the side. &quot;But Sakura-chan,
I&#39;d be the only one to see it. You would be so cute in it. And I would
love to videotape that.&quot;

Sakura sighed. She knew where this was going.
