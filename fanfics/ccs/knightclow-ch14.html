<h1>Sakura: Knight of the Clow (part 14 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/knightclow-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The white haired young man strode confidently down the
street, wings of silver-white stretching from his
back. Robes that had once been tattered were pristine,
now, and his eyes had lost the wild look they had once
had. Still, there was a unusual aura about him, a
sense of dangerous potential.

Beside him a golden lion padded along, it&#39;s own golden
wings shimmering as he easily kept pace. &quot;Well,&quot;
Keroberos rumbled, &quot;at least we can walk about
unnoticed, today.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Yue found himself smiling slightly, taking in
the crowds of costumed revelers. People were dressed
in the oddest costumes, such as knights, witches,
monsters and many other variations. Yue and Keroberos
still stood out, but at least people seemed to thing
they just had good costumes, rather than being
supernatural themselves.

&quot;Do you think he&#39;s Balmung from .Hack?&quot; a adoring
young woman asked.

&quot;Or maybe from Angel Sanctuary,&quot; another murmured,
looking at Yue intently.

&quot;Whoever he is,&quot; both girls said nearly together,
&quot;he&#39;s GORGEOUS!&quot;

&quot;You seem to have acquired fans,&quot; Keroberos teased as
they walked by.

&quot;Yes, well....&quot; Yue trailed off uncomfortably.

&quot;Can you sense our quarry?&quot; taking pity on him
Keroberos changed the subject, raising his golden
lion&#39;s head to sniff slightly at the evening breeze.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Yue nodded, &quot;and even better I can sense Sakura
and her allies close by. It could be they&#39;ll find the
card without out help.&quot;

&quot;Possibly,&quot; Keroberos agreed. They passed a cake shop,
the sweet scents wafting out then the lion&#39;s stomach
rumbled softly. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he actually blushed.

Yue laughed, remembering his companion&#39;s legendary
appetite from when they had first served Clow Reed.
&quot;I&#39;ll get you some later,&quot; he promised, &quot;after we
finish tonight&#39;s task.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,.&quot; Keroberos rumbled with as much dignity
as possible.

Yue chuckled, glad to see the shoe was on the other
foot.

Before Keroberos could say anything more a scream
echoed off in the distance, ringing against the
buildings. &quot;Lets go,&quot; he was off, four legs eating up
the ground with remarkable speed.

Yue was tempted to stretch out his wings and fly but
restrained himself. They were trying to be discrete,
if possible, especially with this rare opportunity to
travel out in the open. Still he was puffing a bit as
they raced around the corner... only to skid to a stop
in disgust.

&quot;Haunted house!&quot; the sign declared, &quot;Thrills and
chills for all ages!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you screamed like that, Usagi,&quot; the
black haired girl complained as she and her blonde
companion left the building.

&quot;It was scary, Rei,&quot; she said, golden hair falling in
twin streams from her head. She kept a firm grin on
Rei&#39;s arm as she softly added, &quot;I&#39;m glad you were
there to protect me.&quot;

Rei put her hand on Usagi&#39;s, squeezing slightly as
they walked by Yue and Keroberos, &quot;I&#39;ll always be here
for you.&quot;

&quot;Well that was a waste of time,&quot; Yue growled out.

Keroberos didn&#39;t answer, instead he looked at the
building with a frown. &quot;There&#39;s something....&quot; he
paused, searing for the best word then just had to
settle for, &quot;wrong here.&quot;

Yue opened his mouth to say something sarcastic about
the hokey decorations around the house, then closed it
again. For he, too, could feel the presence of some
unknown something within the house, a power that made
his skin prickle oddly. &quot;Should we direct Sakura here
somehow?&quot; he asked after a moment&#39;s thought.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t feel like any of Clow Reed&#39;s work,&quot;
Keroberos murmured softly. He smiled just slightly,
&quot;Besides, I&#39;m curious.&quot;

&quot;You know the old saying about cats and curiosity?&quot;
Yue asked.

&quot;I haven&#39;t died yet,&quot; was Keroberos dry answer.

The young lady at the door took the money, looking at
Yue and Keroberos in awe. &quot;Those are incredible
costumes,&quot; she gushed.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Yue flashed a smile, instantly charming
her. &quot;Could you hold on a few moments before you let
anyone else in?&quot; he dropped his voice, &quot;I want to have
a chance to give my friend a good scare in there.&quot;

She laughed, slapping his arm, &quot;You bad boy.&quot; She
looked up at him with a almost predatory look, &quot;If you
want to go in there with me so that we can be all
alone, I&#39;m here till midnight.&quot;

&quot;Looks like you&#39;ve made another conquest,&quot; Keroberos
laughed once they went into the gloomy interior of the
building.

&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; Yue growled, blushing.

Various skeletons, ghosts and other special effects
popped out at them, but both ignored them as they
moved deeper into the building. There was an
increasing chill in the air, along with an odd
electricity that seemed to jump from nerve to nerve.

&quot;....help me....&quot;

Yue frowned, looking about trying to find the voice.
Unlike the sound effects that echoed through the halls
this sounded genuine, from someone who was really in
distress. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot; he asked Keroberos.

&quot;Yes,&quot; he agreed grimly. The great cat tilted his head
to the side, listening, then Keroberos nodded, &quot;Up
ahead, I think.&quot;

&quot;I could have told you that,&quot; Yue said dryly as they
walked on.

While the stage lights were still on, the area ahead
seemed dimmer, almost as if something was eating the
light cast into the darkness. The two walked on into
the chill and dark, finally finding a closed door that
was locked. Yue grabbed the handle, muscles beneath
his shirt bulging slightly as he twisted and the lock
broke easily.

&quot;I could have magicked it open,&quot; Keroberos complained
mildly.

&quot;My way was faster,&quot; Yue said as he pushed open the
door, a burst of stale air whooshing by them before
they headed inside.

The room was stuffed with boxes and knickknacks, odd
items draped over every available surface. Much of it
was props, likely sorted through before this Halloween
show had begun, then stowed away here until they
needed to pack it all up again. The air was charged
with electricity, the oppressive sense of the
supernatural weighing down on both beings as they
looked around warily.

&quot;Where...?&quot; Keroberos started to ask when she
appeared.

The dust and air swirled together, mist swiftly
pulling together to reveal the spirit&#39;s form. Her eyes
flashed red, her almost skeletal form handing there in
midair as she wailed, &quot;Why won&#39;t someone HELP ME?!&quot;

With that painful cry the wave of power washed over
them, buffeting both with supernatural force but
surprisingly they held fast, the energies splitting
around them. &quot;How do you want us to help?&quot; Keroberos
asked.

She looked startled, gazing at both of them in
surprise, her form shifting to a much more normal
woman. &quot;You can hear me?&quot; she asked, &quot;No one seemed to
before!&quot;

&quot;We aren&#39;t exactly normal,&quot; Yue said dryly.

&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; Keroberos muttered.

The ghost giggled softly, then she grew serious. &quot;I
want to move on,&quot; she said softly, &quot;but something
holds me here....&quot;

Keroberos nodded seriously, looking at her
thoughtfully, his eyes glowing faintly for a few
seconds. &quot;I think I can help,&quot; he offered, then began
to chant softly. The words grew louder as he
continued, filling the room with a odd sort of music,
then with a relieved sigh the spirit was gone.

Yue smiled as he and Keroberos walked back out of the
building, &quot;Disappointed there wasn&#39;t as monster or
something?&quot;

Keroberos shrugged slightly, &quot;It&#39;s nice to simply help
someone for a change, you know.&quot; A pause, &quot;I think
it&#39;s what Clow Reed would have wanted.&quot;

&quot;A point,&quot; he conceded as Yue led the way out into the
deepening twilight. Thankfully the amorous young woman
seemed to be gone, &quot;Let&#39;s go before...&quot;

&quot;There you are!&quot; the girl&#39;s happy voice squealed.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Yue whimpered as she rushed up to them.

Keroberos just chuckled at the pained look on his
face.</pre>
