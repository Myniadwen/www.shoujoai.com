<h1>The Jealousy Card</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sakura took a deep breath of fresh air as she started rollerblading
down the street. It was a beautiful day, and the sun was shining
brightly. A soft breeze gently blew over her as she went on her way to
school. She blushed lightly at the thought of Yukito waiting where he
usually did before school. Sighing, she felt a pang of sadness at the
thought of who he was waiting for. She slowed down, finally coming to a
stop, as her brother rode by on his bike. As long as he was happy,
right?

Waiting a few moments to make sure her brother and Yukito were well on
their way, Sakura started rollerblading again, a little slower this
time. She was glad Yukito had found love, but would she ever find it
herself? She had thought she loved the older boy, but after her talk
with him, she wasn&#39;t so sure anymore. He had told her that her feelings
for him were like the ones she had for her father. Oddly enough,
besides short bouts of sadness over him, she seemed to be doing pretty
well. Maybe she was just being mature about it. But could there be
something else to it? Could it be that maybe she was falling for
someone else? Thinking for a moment, Sakura tried to figure who such a
person could possibly be, but ended up dismissing the idea. She was
happy for Yukito, Sakura decided, and that was all.

Her spirits noticeably higher, Sakura flashed a smile at the
dark-haired girl waiting for her at the front gate of their school.
&quot;Hi, Tomoyo-chan!&quot; she said, skidding to a stop in front of her best
friend.

&quot;Ohayo gozaimasu, Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo said happily. &quot;How did you sleep
last night?&quot;

&quot;Pretty well. I had a strange dream, but I can&#39;t remember it now. You
were in it. And Syaoran-kun. And I was worried about you for some
reason,&quot; Sakura trailed off, trying to remember more of her dream.

&quot;I&#39;m very glad I was in your dreams, Sakura-chan, but don&#39;t be worried
about me,&quot; Tomoyo said thoughtfully. &quot;It was just a dream. And, in any
case, worrying about it won&#39;t do any good. You should try to relax.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Sakura agreed. &quot;I wish I could remember the rest of it,
though. I feel like I have forgotten an important warning about
something.&quot; She pulled off her rollerblades along with the rest of her
protective gear. Standing back up, she walked side by side with Tomoyo
towards their classroom.

&quot;If your dream was a warning about something, I&#39;m certain that you will
eventually figure it out,&quot; Tomoyo said with a reassuring smile.

Sakura found herself smiling back. &#39;I always do feel better after
talking to Tomoyo,&#39; she thought to herself. &quot;Thank you, Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

&quot;Whenever you want to talk, Sakura-chan, please do. I love talking to
you, and if it helps you, I&#39;m happy.&quot; Tomoyo took her seat next to
Sakura&#39;s and started pulling out what she would need for class from her
backpack.

Sitting down in her desk, Sakura grinned to herself. She felt a lot
better about things now. She wasn&#39;t worrying about her dream or her
sadness over Yukito for the moment. Looking through the window, she
watched the late students getting to school. She basked in the warm
sunlight as she waited for class to begin. This day could be a good one
after all.

&quot;How does this look?&quot; Tomoyo asked tentatively as she handed Sakura a
sheet of paper from her binder. Sakura carefully took the paper,
finishing up another bite of her lunch at the same time. She
sweatdropped when she saw the sketch of herself in a costume. There
were several different views to show the whole costume, including the
large bow in back. &quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s... nice,&quot; Sakura said, not quite knowing what else to say.

&quot;I think it would look really cute on you, Sakura-chan.&quot; Hearts
appeared in Tomoyo&#39;s eyes and she blushed as she thought of Sakura in
the finished costume. &quot;Do you think it could use more lace?&quot;

&quot;No, no, I think it&#39;s fine the way it is,&quot; Sakura said hastily. Her
troubles with wild Clow Cards had ended when she became the Card
Mistress, and now with things settling down after Eriol, there really
wasn&#39;t much of a need for her to go out as a Card Captor anymore. But
Tomoyo still made plenty of costumes for her, getting Sakura to come
over to her house and try them on so the dark-haired girl could at
least videotape her in them.

&quot;Every time I finish a new costume, when I look at it, I get the
feeling that something isn&#39;t right. It doesn&#39;t seem really finished.
But when I finally see you wearing it, Sakura-chan, it&#39;s like the last
piece of a puzzle has fallen into place. You complete them.&quot; You
complete me, Tomoyo wanted to add.

Sakura blushed as Tomoyo smiled gently at her. For a second, it felt
like she and Tomoyo were the only ones there. The feeling slowly faded
and Sakura noticed all her classmates busily chatting through lunch.
She wasn&#39;t sure if she was relieved or saddened that the moment had
ended so quickly.

&quot;I&#39;ll start working on this one when I get home,&quot; Tomoyo finished. Her
head tilted to the side and a worried look spread over her face.
&quot;Sakura-chan, are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Hai. I&#39;m fine,&quot; Sakura said, laughing nervously. For some reason, she
felt awkward all of a sudden. Glancing around a bit while she ate some
more of her lunch, she noticed Syaoran walking by on his own.
&quot;Syaoran-kun! Why don&#39;t you have lunch with us?&quot; she asked happily.
Syaoran paused for a moment before accepting, sitting beside the two
girls.

&quot;I really hope we don&#39;t have much homework tonight,&quot; Sakura said
conversationally. &quot;It&#39;s my night to make dinner.&quot;

&quot;I hope so, too. If you need to pick up ingredients or anything, I
could come with you before you go home,&quot; Tomoyo offered.

Sakura smiled at her. &quot;Thanks, Tomoyo-chan. I don&#39;t think I need
anything, though.&quot;

&quot;Sakura...&quot; Syaoran interrupted.

&quot;Hoe?&quot; Sakura turned to Syaoran who was now staring straight ahead.
Tomoyo turned to look at him as well, putting aside the sketches.

&quot;There&#39;s something I want to tell you,&quot; Syaoran said slowly. He was
really nervous, even though he&#39;d probably never admit it to himself.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Sakura asked curiously. Tomoyo smiled at him, knowing
what it was that he wanted to say. She nodded slightly, as if urging
him to go on.

&quot;I... I...&quot;

&quot;Syaoran-kun, are you feeling okay?&quot; Sakura asked worriedly.

&quot;It&#39;s about Sakura-chan, right, Li-kun?&quot; Tomoyo suggested gently,
trying to help him along.

Syaoran nodded emphatically. Sakura looked more and more interested as
she waited to hear what he had to say.

Syaoran rounded on Tomoyo and asked her pointedly, &quot;Can you go?&quot; He
wanted to be alone with Sakura if he was going to tell her.

The dark haired girl smiled and nodded, picking up her notebook she
walked over to a nearby tree.

Syaoran watched her go before turning back, to meet the green eyes that
were watching him in confusion. He gathered his breath and in one long
exhale managed to force out, &quot;I... I... I like you!&quot;

Sakura blinked in confusion several times. &quot;You what?&quot;

Syaoran stood up and made a hasty retreat back towards the classroom.
He nearly bumped into Naoko in his hurry.

&quot;What did he mean?&quot; Sakura asked aloud. She just couldn&#39;t figure what
on earth Syaoran was trying to do, telling her that he liked her and
then running away. Tomoyo leaned towards her.

&quot;I think Li-kun was trying to say that he loves you,&quot; Tomoyo explained
in a soft whisper.

Sakura&#39;s face turned a deep shade of crimson as realization hit. She
opened her mouth and tried to speak, but nothing came out. After a few
false starts she finally got out, &quot;But... but... how?&quot;

Tomoyo smiled brightly at her friend. &quot;That&#39;s not hard, Sakura-chan.
It&#39;s easy to fall in love with you. It&#39;s telling you that is the hard
part.&quot; Standing up as the bell rang for the end of lunch, Tomoyo
offered Sakura her hand. Sakura, still in shock, let the other girl
help her stand. She tried to walk, but stumbled a bit. Tomoyo helped
her catch her balance and, smiling gently, helped her back towards the
classroom.

was a bit colder after school, but the weather was still pleasant. A
gentle breeze meandered past the two girls on their way home. Sakura
was still having trouble coming to grips with what had happened earlier
with Syaoran. She was so worried, she wasn&#39;t really aware of where they
were going. Tomoyo was silently leading her home, trying to give her
best friend time to think. Though it was still early in the evening,
Sakura felt tired, exhausted. She just wanted to lie down so that she
wouldn&#39;t have to think about anything. Questions kept racing through
her mind. How could he? Was he serious? And what should she do now?

Sakura, walking slowly, noticed all of a sudden that Tomoyo wasn&#39;t at
her side anymore. She turned around and saw the other girl standing
there, her long, dark hair fluttering behind her. Sakura looked at her
with surprise. Her friend seemed deep in thought.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

Tomoyo looked at her, but didn&#39;t answer right away. Sakura felt a pang
of nervousness. It was such an unusual attitude in her friend...

&quot;Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo said at last, startling Sakura a little, &quot;do you
remember when I said that I loved you?&quot;

That was an easy one, Sakura thought. Tomoyo had told her that many,
many times. &quot;Un!&quot; she nodded.

&quot;You looked happy, Sakura-chan, and you said that you loved me too. And
I said: &#39;But Sakura-chan doesn&#39;t mean the same thing as me.&#39; Do you
remember?&quot;

Again, Sakura nodded.

&quot;After that, I told you that I&#39;d explain everything later. Isn&#39;t that
right?&quot;

Sakura&#39;s eyes lit up with remembrance. &quot;Oh yes, I remember! I wondered
so much about that, I couldn&#39;t figure what in the world you were
talking about.&quot;

Tomoyo smiled gently. &quot;Well, I think I will tell you now, Sakura-chan,&quot;
she said. &quot;Truth is, I&#39;m a little nervous about this. I don&#39;t know if
the time is right, I&#39;m not sure you will understand.&quot; She paused for a
moment, and then added softly, &quot;But I&#39;m going to give it a try anyway.&quot;

Sakura looked at Tomoyo intently. She felt very excited all of a
sudden. The dark-haired girl sounded so serious it was a bit scary, but
an overwhelming curiosity gnawed at her. After all, she thought, this
was Tomoyo. Whatever she had to say, it couldn&#39;t be anything bad, could
it?

&quot;What is it? Please, Tomoyo-chan, tell me!&quot; Sakura begged, her face
bright with eagerness.

Tomoyo took a deep breath and slowly released it. She gazed deeply into
Sakura&#39;s beautiful green eyes. &quot;Sakura-chan, we&#39;ve been very close for
a long time now, and I want you to know that you&#39;ve always been the
most important thing in the world to me.&quot;

Sakura smiled at her. &quot;You are a very important friend to me too,
Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

Tomoyo sweatdropped and decided to try a different approach.

&quot;Whatever I do, wherever I go, I&#39;m always thinking about you,
Sakura-chan. It&#39;s like...&quot; she was having trouble finding the right
words. &quot;You make me think of an angel, Sakura-chan. You are like a
heavenly angel sent down to this earthly realm to fill the lives of
humans with light. I feel like I would never be able to repay you for
the joy you&#39;ve brought into mine. That&#39;s the way I feel, in my heart,
when I think about you.&quot;

Sakura felt a rosy blush spread all over her cheeks. She lowered her
gaze, forced out a shaky little laugh and rubbed the back of her head.
&quot;I... I... Oh, Tomoyo-chan, it&#39;s nothing like that! I mean, I&#39;m not an
angel. I&#39;m not heavenly or anything. I&#39;m just...&quot; Sakura paused
briefly, as if gathering her thoughts, then looked back up and smiled
at her friend, a genuine smile this time. &quot;You say the nicest things,
Tomoyo-chan. I feel all warm and mushy inside when you say that kind of
thing, even though I&#39;m not the way you say. Thank you so much! You&#39;re
my best friend in the whole wide world, and I&#39;m really, really glad
that you&#39;re happy when I&#39;m around.&quot;

Tomoyo sighed softly. This was sooo much harder than she thought it
would be. Part of her just wanted to stop, put on her trademark happy
smile and tell Sakura that they were late and that they should be
hurrying. She knew Sakura would then dismiss everything Tomoyo had just
said as &quot;some more of Tomoyo&#39;s weird stuff&quot;, and things between them
would return to normal. It would be so easy, she thought, backing off
and leaving love confessions for another day. But she couldn&#39;t do that,
not this time. Not when she had already come this far.

&quot;Sakura-chan,&quot; she started again, trying to find stronger words to
express the feelings in her heart, &quot;I&#39;m always happiest when we are
spending time together. And whenever I&#39;m unhappy, all I have to do is
think about you to feel better. When I see you wearing one of the
dresses I make for you, my heart feels like it&#39;s going to pound out of
my chest in joy. Being with you, doing things with you is my idea of
heaven. You mean so much to me. I can&#39;t bear the thought of not being
able to see you. I want to be with you, always, forever.&quot;

Sakura blushed again, redder this time. Tomoyo was always saying
strange things around her, and she knew she should be used to it by
now, but this... this was like all of them rolled into one. She wasn&#39;t
sure what to say, or if she should just wait for her friend to
continue.

Tomoyo was blushing a little, too. She had said so much, and yet, she
could tell, just by looking at Sakura, that she still hadn&#39;t gotten her
point across. &quot;I know you were surprised, today, when you found out
about Syaoran&#39;s love for you, but I understand his feelings only too
well. Since the day I met you, you have been like the sun in my life,
outshining everything else. Sakura-chan, cards aren&#39;t the only magic
you have at your command. I&#39;ve been under your spell for a long time.&quot;

Sakura didn&#39;t realize she&#39;d been holding her breath until her lungs
started to ache for air. She was blushing as red as a peony now, and
she was starting to find it difficult to stand still. She felt weak in
the knees from the nervousness building up inside her.

&quot;Sakura-chan, daisuki desu wa,&quot; Tomoyo declared with earnest feeling,
and then, before her innocent cousin could once again misunderstand
those three simple words, she continued, &quot;And I don&#39;t mean just as a
friend. I love you so much more than that. Sakura-chan, I&#39;m in love.
I&#39;m in love with you, I love you. Do you understand what I&#39;m trying to
say?&quot; Tomoyo took Sakura&#39;s hands in her own and gazed again into those
dazzling green eyes. &quot;I love you,&quot; she repeated softly.

&quot;To... To... Tomoyo-chan...&quot; Sakura barely managed to get out. Her
heart was thudding a mad tempo in her chest, and she was sure her eyes
looked like saucers. The shock of Syaoran&#39;s confession felt like
nothing compared to what she was feeling at this moment. She had
thought that, after Syaoran, nothing in the world could surprise her
anymore. Oh god, had she been wrong! She knew that she had to say
something, she could tell the other girl was waiting for her to say
something, but her mind had gone completely blank. First Syaoran and
now Tomoyo? It was too much for her. She felt like her whole world had
been turned upside down.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan,&quot; she stammered, &quot;I... I... I&#39;ll talk to you later,&quot;
Sakura finished, a little lamely. Turning around too quickly, she
almost stumbled. Tomoyo&#39;s hand on her shoulder barely helped her regain
her balance in time.

Waving to Sakura while the brown-haired girl hurried off, Tomoyo
called, &quot;Bye, Sakura-chan! Sleep well!&quot;

Glancing over her shoulder, Sakura caught a glimpse of Tomoyo&#39;s smiling
face. She managed a faint smile of her own and waved back weakly before
turning back around. Her mind felt sluggish as she tried to sort things
out.

What was she supposed to do? Nothing in her life seemed to make sense
anymore. Breaking into a fast sprint after turning a corner, Sakura ran
all the way back home.

&quot;Oh, so the monster&#39;s home,&quot; Touya said conversationally as her heard
Sakura come in through the front door. He put down the job ads he&#39;d
been reading, ready to see his sister&#39;s angry face. He was shocked to
see her disappearing up the stairs. &quot;Sakura?&quot; The small glimpse of her
hadn&#39;t offered much of an explanation as to why she hadn&#39;t argued with
him, but she had looked rather distraught. Worse than he&#39;d seen her in
a long, long time. The house was silent again, except for the rustling
of the newspaper on his lap. &quot;Well, she is in high school now. She&#39;s
probably just getting overemotional about something,&quot; he told himself,
not quite believing it. Telling himself not to worry, he went back to
looking for another job, but he kept glancing up towards her room,
wondering what was really wrong.

&quot;Kero-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

Sakura shifted her arms on the open window ledge trying to get
comfortable. She could see the moon behind the leaves and the Jade
Plate swam for a moment in the wetness that suddenly appeared in her
eyes.

&quot;Kero-chan....&quot;

Kero-chan clicked his tongue and glided to her side.

&quot;Sakura&quot; he chided, &quot;You haven&#39;t finished a sentence yet tonight.
What&#39;s happened?&quot;

She sighed and pressed her eyes against her pajama sleeve. &quot;Kero-chan,
I had a dream last night.&quot;

&quot;Ah&quot;, the Seal Beast breathed in pleasure. Sakura&#39;s dreams always
carried a great deal of portent. He drifted to where he could look at
her. &quot;What did you dream?&quot;

&quot;I dreamt that Tomoyo-chan and Li-kun were in danger, and it was
because of me.&quot; She paused, breathing hard, and then the dam broke. &quot;I
was so upset, and all through the dream I kept talking and nothing was
coming out of my mouth. I wanted to tell them today at school, but I
didn&#39;t know how, and I thought that maybe I would find a way, but every
time I tried the time was wrong, and then Li-kun wanted to talk to me
alone, and then Tomoyo-chan said...&quot;

&quot;Clow Card!&quot; Kero-chan yelled spinning towards the open window.
&quot;Hurry!&quot;

Sakura could almost believe that this was the same dream. She was
talking and no one was hearing her. Moving quickly she gathered a few
things and climbed out onto the tree. It occurred to her as she
descended that she should call Li and Tomoyo, but she also felt that
being alone would be nice too. At least with a Card to capture she
wasn&#39;t just sitting and thinking.

Once out of sight of her house Sakura drew out the Key and joined
Kero-chan in the air. He flew purposefully, as if he knew where he was
going. Sakura saw, in her mind&#39;s eye, the many videos Tomoyo had taken
of the Seal Beast. Smiling at the thought she was suddenly very sorry
she didn&#39;t call the dark hair girl. Tomoyo would forgive her, there was
no question, but at the same time Sakura also knew that no matter what
her mood Tomoyo would never exclude Sakura from something that would
give her pleasure. Before she realized what was happening the phone was
in her hand, and the redial pressed. But what to tell her? Sakura had
no idea where they were going.

&quot;Look!&quot; Kero-chan cried, stabbing a paw downwards. Sakura, phone to her
head, looked down, and saw Li running in the same direction they were
flying in, his glowing Lasin Board held before him.

&quot;Sakura-chan?&quot;

Momentarily disoriented Sakura realized the voice was Tomoyo&#39;s and the
source was the phone. &quot;Tomoyo-chan!&quot; she yelled over the wind, &quot;We&#39;re
near the clock tower, after a Card....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m on my way,&quot; and she was gone.

Sakura tucked the phone back into her pocket and drew closer to
Kero-chan. &quot;What should we do?&quot; she mused aloud.

Kero-chan turned towards her, smiling broadly, &quot;Card Capture Sakura...&quot;

And he was gone.

Sakura suddenly found herself standing in a room. The Key was in her
hand. The room, a sort of box, had no door, no windows and the walls
were a sickly green. Across from her Li stood, looking equally as
surprised and Kero-chan was nowhere to be seen.

&quot;Li-kun?&quot; she began, but no sound reached her ears. He too opened his
mouth, but she heard nothing. Stepping back she pulled out the Sword
Card, exchanged the Key for the Sword and swiped at the nearest wall.
It had no effect. Li also began trying attacks on the room, with the
same effect. She moved closer to him, her hand reaching for him, and
just as she touched his arm her hand went threw his as if he were a
ghost. Alarmed she drew back...he didn&#39;t seem to be aware of her. He
suddenly turned and appeared to be smiling at someone behind her.
Sakura looked back and saw Tomoyo, video camera in hand, looking at Li
with a look that sent a chill through Sakura. Rushing to her side
Sakura was almost weak with relief. She called Tomoyo&#39;s name, heard
nothing, and stopped short. Slowly she extended a hand... it passed
threw Tomoyo without any resistance. Tomoyo and Li crossed the small
room, intent it seemed, only on each other. Sakura drew back in
confusion as the two came together in a passionate kiss.

Nothing more than shock made Sakura sit down heavily. Sword slipped
silently from her fingers. What did this mean? What was happening? Her
mind reeled at the sight. Closing her eyes for a moment, hoping it was
a dream, she opened them again. In the center of the room stood Tomoyo
and Yukito, kissing.

&quot;This is a dream,&quot; she screamed soundlessly, desperately, &quot;Tomoyo-chan
loves me and only me, she told me so! Only me! None of this is real!&quot;

Raising her head once more she found herself confronted by Li, sword in
hand, and Tomoyo clinging to his side. Li was looking at her with
unhidden hatred. He raised the sword, and Sakura had just enough time
to exchange the Sword for Shield as he swung at her. The sword
rebounded, sending a shock through his arm. He staggered back,
disbelief evident on his face.

&quot;Why?!&quot; Sakura screamed mentally, her mouth forming the word. Drawing
herself up to her knees she studied Li. He was panting, and still
looked angry, but he didn&#39;t continue to fight. Could it be that he knew
he was fighting a Card? That had to be the answer. They were trapped
within an uncaptured Card, and she had to figure out what the Card was.

Suddenly the pieces were fitting. She was seeing something that would
make her... what? Angry? Jealous? They must be experiencing something
similar. Li would see...

Sakura sucked in her breath. Li would see Sakura and Tomoyo! No wonder
he turned on her! But no, why fight Sakura, unless Sakura looked like
Tomoyo to him. That would explain his surprised look at being rebuffed
by Shield. Sakura acted quickly, bringing out Mirror, &quot;Show me what
Li-kun is seeing&quot; she commanded. In the disc Mirror held Sakura saw
exactly what she expected. In the place where she knelt on the floor
cowered Tomoyo; a Sakura, presumably Tomoyo, was being crushed to Li&#39;s
side by his arm around her waist, and she looking horrified, weakly
fighting to reach the figure on the floor.

She locked eyes with Mirror and felt the color drain from her face,
&quot;Show me what Tomoyo-chan sees,&quot; she mouthed. A chill went through her
at the thought of what she was about to see.

The first thing she saw was herself. She was smiling happily, seemingly
without a care in the world. Two arms were around her waist, holding
her tight. They belonged to Syaoran, who was uncharacteristically
grinning. Lying on the floor in shreds was one of Tomoyo&#39;s costumes for
Sakura. Sakura instantly remembered it as the design Tomoyo had shown
her earlier that day. Syaoran pulled up an ofudu, chanting briefly
before throwing it on the tattered costume. Sakura&#39;s counterpart in the
Mirror just laughed as the costume burned, snuggling closer to Syaoran.
She stopped watching when the images kissed.

Tears ran down Tomoyo&#39;s pale cheeks as she looked on helplessly. A
steel band crushed Sakura heart at the sight and she lashed out at
Mirror, blinded by tears of rage and sorrow. &quot;No!&quot; she screamed over
and over, &quot;It&#39;s not like that.&quot; She rose to her feet, picked up Sword
and continued to rampage about the little green room. Li and Tomoyo
ignored her and again embraced as if nothing had happened. Sakura
stopped at the sight, and a sob escaped her.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan...&quot;

As if she had heard her name the ghost Tomoyo turned her head and
smiled at Sakura, Li too smiled at her, but then the couple locked eyes
again and kissed. Sakura decided that this had gone on long enough. She
pulled out Darkness. If they couldn&#39;t see each other the spell just
might be broken.

&quot;Surround Li-kun, Tomoyo-chan and myself in a darkness that we cannot
see through.&quot; Instantly the room was gone and she stood alone in a vast
night. Hesitantly she tested to see if the Card was still working.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot; she said, and heard nothing. It was still working.
Obviously she had to name this Card to overpower it, like she had had
to do with Mirror. Drawing herself upright she closed her eyes and
yelled with all her might, &quot;Jealousy!&quot; and the sound broke on her
deafened ears like a storm. Suddenly the green room broke like glass
into a million tiny pieces. Before she could do anything they gathered
to her right, and were gone. She quickly recalled Darkness and found
herself on the street below the clock tower facing both Li and Tomoyo,
who were looking around dazed. Li seemed to come back to himself first
and turned to Sakura with a look of raw hatred. Sakura, shocked, took a
step back in alarm. Li looked from her to Tomoyo, and Sakura instantly
knew she had to act, and quickly.

Sakura was fast, but Li was faster.

Li drew out an ofuda and threw it at Sakura even as she invoked Shield.
The glowing paper landed on her arm and she couldn&#39;t move. Li grabbed
Tomoyo roughly by the arm and began dragging her away.

Tomoyo looked back at Sakura, who was struggling again the spell.
&quot;Sakura-chan!&quot; she yelled helplessly. &quot;Sakura-chan!&quot;

&quot;Tomoyo-chan!&quot; Sakura screamed back in anger and frustration.
&quot;TOMOYO-CHAN!&quot; ____

Syaoran landed on a rooftop far away from the immobilized Sakura. He
shoved Tomoyo from him when they landed. She tried to keep her balance
but fell to her hands and knees. &quot;You...&quot; he growled. &quot;You&#39;re what&#39;s
keeping me from her. You&#39;re what&#39;s standing in my way. She and I are
supposed to be together, but you keep getting in the way.&quot;

&quot;No... That&#39;s not it. I just want Sakura-chan to be happy.&quot; Tomoyo
looked up at the angry gaze he directed at her and shrank back. &quot;I love
her. I just hope she would be happy with me.&quot; She knew it was the wrong
thing to say to the enraged boy even before she uttered it, but it was
the truth.

&quot;How could she ever be happy with you?&quot; Syaoran sneered. &quot;You just get
in her way. She&#39;s only your friend because she pities you.&quot;

Tomoyo shook her head. &quot;No, she&#39;s my best friend. We care about each
other. We&#39;ll always be friends...&quot; Her mind raced. Nothing seemed
certain to her anymore. The horrible images of Sakura and Syaoran came
flooding back to her mind, threatening to overwhelm her. Syaoran&#39;s hand
grabbed her arm, hauling her back to her feet. The dark haired girl
winced at the sudden explosion of pain the cruel movement brought. She
flinched as he clutched her arm tightly.

&quot;I want you to leave her alone. To leave us alone. Do you understand?&quot;
Syaoran hissed angrily. He dragged the limp girl against his chest,
shaking her hard.

Tomoyo, her dark hair flying wildly about her, closed her eyes tightly.
This only brought back earlier images. &quot;No,&quot; she said, trying to make
him understand, &quot;I won&#39;t leave unless Sakura tells me too. She means
everything to me. I love her!&quot; Looking at him defiantly, she tried
desperately to bring up happier images of Sakura, ones she treasured
and kept dear to her heart.

Angrily, Syaoran shoved the dark haired girl backwards. Tomoyo gasped
as she fell, landing hard on her side. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare stand in my way.
She will be mine!&quot; he howled.

Keeping her eyes clamped shut, Tomoyo desperately ran memories over and
over in her mind. When she first met Sakura, when Sakura had come to
her house for the first time, when Sakura had first worn one of the
costumes she made, the first time she&#39;d videotaped Sakura with her
camcorder. She waited quietly for what Syaoran would say next, but
nothing came. Cautiously, she opened her eyes and looked around.
&quot;Sakura-chan!&quot; she yelled, catching a glimpse of the brown haired girl.
Forcing herself to her feet, she couldn&#39;t help but smile as she ran to
her friend. She stopped dead in her tracks, her eyes growing wide, when
she saw Syaoran standing behind her.

Tomoyo&#39;s spirits sank as the two kissed. Somewhere, in her mind,
someone screamed, &quot;NO!&quot; She shut her eyes, wishing the vision would
disappear, but it remained when she looked again. She took a few slow
steps towards them, her heart aching with each step. &quot;Sakura-chan....
I&#39;m... I&#39;m happy for you,&quot; she said quietly. Sakura looked directly at
her, giving her an icy stare that chilled Tomoyo to the bone.
&quot;Sakura-chan?&quot; she asked weakly, &quot;Why?&quot;

Sakura didn&#39;t find her worthy of her notice as she bestowed all her
attention on Syaoran. The two shared a deep kiss, ignoring the forlorn
Tomoyo, as if she ceased to exist.

Dropping to her already scratched knees, Tomoyo&#39;s small body was
wracked with sobs. &quot;Sakura-chan....&quot;, she whimpered, clutching her
stomach. She couldn&#39;t bear it. Why was this happening? Glancing back
up, Tomoyo saw things had changed. Sakura was wearing a wedding dress
and Syaoran a tux. A stab of pain shot through Tomoyo&#39;s heart. Sakura
had promised her that she could make her wedding dress when they day
finally came, but that wasn&#39;t anything she&#39;d make for Sakura. Looking
through her tear blurred vision, she could see her camcorder smashed on
the floor near them, the film pulled out. Blinking back her tears,
Tomoyo could see things had shifted once again. Sakura now held a baby.
Sakura and Syaoran&#39;s baby.

Unable to stand watching anymore, Tomoyo struggled to her feet. She
stumbled away from the scene. &quot;You don&#39;t need me anymore, do you,
Sakura-chan?&quot; she asked the thin air. Again, from somewhere, came the
same scream of &quot;No!&quot; Had she dreamed it? Tomoyo felt numb all over.
Nothing seemed to matter anymore. The person that mattered most didn&#39;t
care about her at all. And she&#39;d lost to Syaoran. She felt... jealous
of him. She wished she could be the one to make Sakura that happy. She
just prayed Sakura would always be happy as she stepped up on the ledge
of the rooftop. &quot;You don&#39;t need me anymore, Sakura-chan. You don&#39;t even
want me as a friend. But you&#39;re happy.&quot; She smiled sadly, blinded by
her tears. &quot;I&#39;m glad. I&#39;m glad that Sakura-chan is happy. Please stay
that way, Sakura-chan. I love you. Forever. Maybe I can be your
guardian angel,&quot; she added hopefully. With that, Tomoyo stepped off the
ledge into nothingness. She kept her eyes shut tight as the ground
raced to meet her.

Syaoran watched, shocked by the sudden turn of events. He&#39;d intended to
make his point clear with Tomoyo that she never get in his way with
Sakura, but she had turned suddenly and started looking off at
something only she could see. After talking to herself, the dark haired
girl had thrown herself off the rooftop. The screams of the Seal Beast
had surprised him, but Syaoran couldn&#39;t locate the magical animal no
matter where he looked. He blinked several times, still confused, and
unsure about what had just happened. &quot;At least she won&#39;t get in my way
anymore,&quot; he said to no one in particular.

The world seemed to slow as a small dark haired girl plummeted through
the air. Further and further she went, the brief amount of time slowing
to a near stop for the girl as everything seemed to move in slow
motion. &quot;Sakura-chan...&quot; she whispered, one last time, her eyes shut
tight. Her heart felt torn from her as if it had been ripped out. Her
whole world, her whole reason to live, had been crushed in the matter
of minutes. She was looking forward to an end to her pain, to the end
of her torment, to oblivion. And Sakura, her dear Sakura, would be
happy.

Her fall was suddenly interrupted as two arms wrapped around her
tightly, fumbling desperately to hold on to her, gripping her like a
pair of steel bars. &quot;Tomoyo-chan!&quot; a voice cried in terror, over and
over in a frantic pitch. Her mind wondered what was happening, but she
couldn&#39;t bring herself to open her eyes. Her decent slowed, stopped,
and then began again at a snails pace. The voice, close to her ear, was
Sakura&#39;s. Tomoyo could feel her breathing, her breath coming in a
labored pant as they gently reached to ground.

As they touched down Sakura slid from the wand, all of her energy spent
from the scare Tomoyo had just given her. She lay panting for several
minutes, fighting to collect herself.

Opening her eyes slowly, Tomoyo blinked several times in confusion.
Wasn&#39;t she supposed to be dead by now? She took a second to glance
around, and found herself on the street below the building Syaoran had
carried her too. The street she had sought to end her life on. Sakura,
with a worried yet determined expression, was on her hands and knees
beside her. Maybe she was dead, she thought. Maybe this was heaven.
&quot;Sakura-chan? Why? Why did you save me, Sakura-chan?&quot; Tomoyo asked, her
mind reeling. &quot;I did this for you. You&#39;re happy. That&#39;s all I wanted.
You didn&#39;t need me anymore.&quot;

&quot;No, Tomoyo-chan.&quot; Sakura heaved herself into a kneeling position, her
hand clutching for the small girl. She embraced her friend, crushing
her to her chest, &quot;I always need you,&quot; she sobbed, &quot;You&#39;re my best
friend. You mean so much to me. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do if you were
gone.&quot; She blinked back the stinging tears in her eyes as she looked up
at the dark haired girl. Her body felt cold all over from the recent
shock.

&quot;But, Sakura-chan, you... I would only get in the way. You aren&#39;t even
happy as friends anymore. You have what you want. I hope you and Li-kun
are very happy.&quot; Tomoyo mustered a pained smile before turning away.

Sakura bolted to her feet and seized her friend. &quot;No! Tomoyo-chan,
listen to me, it&#39;s the Clow Card. The Jealousy Card it&#39;s still
affecting you! We&#39;re best friends, nothing will ever change that. I
know you want me to be happy, but losing you would definitely not make
me happy. And I want you to be happy, too.&quot; The Card Captor sighed,
looking deeply into Tomoyo&#39;s stormy blue eyes. &quot;Tomoyo-chan, you have
to fight this. Please? For me?&quot;

Tomoyo held her head, confusion flooding her mind. Glancing at the
street, to Sakura and back, she shuddered, unsure of herself. Finally
giving out a small cry, Tomoyo threw herself into Sakura&#39;s arms. &quot;Oh,
Sakura-chan, I&#39;m so sorry....&quot; The dark haired girl sobbed. &quot;I just...
I thought you hated me... and that you were happy with, with... him...&quot;
Her sobs overwhelmed her and she feel silent.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan, it&#39;s going to be okay,&quot; Sakura said soothingly, hugging
the limp girl close to her. Tomoyo&#39;s hot tears rolled onto her
shoulder, soaking into the cloth of her pajamas. &quot;It&#39;s just the Card. I
could never hate you, Tomoyo-chan. You know that. You&#39;re my very
important person.&quot; For a second, Sakura wondered where she had heard
that before, but she quickly shrugged it off, not having time to worry
about it. &quot;Please, Tomoyo-chan, don&#39;t cry. It&#39;s alright now.&quot;

The dark haired girl took another shuddering breath before standing up
on her own. &quot;Thank you, Sakura-chan.&quot; A small, genuine smile formed on
her soft lips. &quot;I always knew you would come save me if anything
happened.&quot;

Sakura smiled back, relief filling her soul. &quot;Of course I would,
Tomoyo-chan. I&#39;m not about to let you get hurt by something like this.
Or anything, for that matter. I don&#39;t want to see you hurt,
Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

Before the Card Captor could think to ask Tomoyo if she was ready to go
home, a sword slashed the air between both girls. Tomoyo gasped and
Sakura jumped back, her staff in hand. She got ready to get a Card out
just in case. Between them stood Syaoran, hatred and jealousy flaring
in his eyes. &quot;Li-kun!? Fight it, Li-kun! It&#39;s just the Jealousy Card
affecting you.&quot;

&quot;Fight what?&quot; Syaoran spat angrily. &quot;I saw the two of you. She&#39;s trying
to steal you from me. She&#39;s trying to get in the way. To come between
us!&quot; Raising the sword, he swiped at a stunned Tomoyo.

Sakura lunged forward, her eyes wide with fear of what he might do. Her
staff barely blocked his sword inches from the dark haired girl.
&quot;Li-kun, don&#39;t do this!&quot; she pleaded as Tomoyo sank to her knees.

He leapt backwards, landing in a fighting stance. He held the sword
straight up in front of him, his eyes falling closed as he began to
chant. Energy surrounded the blade.

Sakura barely had time to throw herself in the way of Tomoyo when she
realized what he was doing. &quot;Shield!&quot; she yelled desperately as his
attack came flying towards them. The burst of lightening dissipated
against Shield, leaving the two girls unhurt. Sakura glanced at Tomoyo,
assuring herself that her frightened friend was unharmed when another
attack hit...and another and another. &quot;Li-kun! Leave her alone!&quot; she
screamed, &quot;Don&#39;t hurt her!!&quot; Sakura wondered how his rage could be so
focused on the dark haired girl behind her. &quot;She&#39;s never been anything
but kind to you!&quot;

Syaoran narrowed his eyes as he began chanting again. Sweeping the
sword down, a burst of wind struck against Shield. &quot;How could you
know?&quot; he demanded. &quot;She blinds you with her hero worship, but she
keeps coming between us. She&#39;s why you don&#39;t returned my feelings.&quot;

&#39;That&#39;s what this is all about isn&#39;t it?&#39; Sakura asked herself as she
braced herself for his next attack. &#39;They both... They&#39;re both in love
with me. That&#39;s how Jealousy got to them both so easily, and so
strongly! This is all my fault.&#39;

&quot;Stop this!&quot; the Card Captor yelled.

Turning to face him as she rose, Sakura pulled out Windy and sent it
spilling before her. &quot;Bind Li-kun!&quot; she yelled, bringing the Key down
on the Card. The resulting rush of air quickly surrounded the startled
boy, pinning his limps tight against his body. Sakura didn&#39;t hesitate
as she twirled the Key over head again, Windy almost drowning out her
command &quot;...Clow Card!&quot; The Card Captor brought the Key down on the
softly glowing green dot within the rushing wind. The Jealously Card
lifted out of Windy and floated to her waiting hand.

For a moment, the only sound that could be heard was the wind rustling
past them. Sakura recalled Windy and turned to face Syaoran, hoping the
danger was now over. Utter silence claimed the street for a moment.
Then the clatter of Syaoran&#39;s sword against the asphalt broke the
silence. His mind started to clear from the haze of jealousy the Card
had managed to place over him. &quot;Sakura&quot; he stammered, his faced
blossoming to a brilliant crimson, &quot;... I... I don&#39;t know how I... I
don&#39;t know what to say... I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; He lowered his head.

Sakura let Shield fade away, but remained standing protectively in
front of Tomoyo. &quot;I&#39;m not the one you intended to kill,&quot; she said
quietly. A second silence descended, this one fraught with
embarrassment. Sakura looked at her friends and came to a decision.

&quot;Fine,&quot; she said, almost to herself. She was tired of fighting. Tomoyo
and Syaoran looked back at her quizzically, wondering what she meant.
&quot;Fine. You both want to know who I love, don&#39;t you? Stop this, then. I
care too much about both of you to watch either of you get hurt. The
Jealousy Card was using both of you. And it&#39;s because of me, because of
your feelings for me! It&#39;s still getting to you both because of me. So
I want to put an end to this.&quot; Sakura took a deep breath before
continuing. &quot;I will make my decision tonight. I&#39;ll tell you both
tomorrow the one who I love.&quot;

Syaoran looked up at her, his face still scarlet, &quot;Tomorrow you&#39;ll....&quot;

Sakura nodded, cutting him off. &quot;Hai. Tomorrow I&#39;ll tell you both which
one I&#39;m in love with.&quot;

Bending down, Syaoran retrieved his sword from the ground. Without a
word he turned and leapt into the darkness.

As soon as he left, Sakura collapsed to her hands and knees. The
battle, the Card, and her own nervousness about what had happened
earlier that day had finally taken their toll. She glanced over when
she felt a gentle hand on her shoulder. She saw Tomoyo&#39;s concerned face
looking back down at her. Before the dark haired girl could say
anything, Sakura threw her arms around her friend with a tearful howl.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan! Oh God, I almost lost you so many times tonight. You had
me so worried. I&#39;m so sorry you got dragged into all this. If I hadn&#39;t
called you, none of this would have happened.&quot; She gently rocked back
and forth, cradling the dark haired girl against her.

Tomoyo sighed softly. She liked having the other girl so protective of
her, but she hated seeing Sakura so worried about things. &quot;Sakura-chan,
I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s all over now.&quot;

Sakura scrubbed her face with a free hand, trying to dry the tears that
continued to threaten. She untangled her arms from her friend&#39;s neck.
Using her staff to help her weary body stand upright, Sakura looked out
at the dark night sky. &quot;No. Not yet. I still have to find out who I...&quot;
She blushed slightly at the thought. In her mind she could see the boy
who had been her rival, but had turned out to be her greatest help with
the Clow Cards. She could also see her best friend, the girl that had
always been there for her. She let her head drop sadly. She had no idea
how she&#39;d make a decision by the next morning.

&quot;Sakura-chan,&quot; Tomoyo said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.
Sakura looked so fragile standing there. &quot;Sakura-chan, please don&#39;t
worry too much about tomorrow. Just make the decision that will make
you happy.&quot;

Sakura turned back to her skeptically. &quot;And I won&#39;t have to go rescuing
you from jumping off buildings if its Li-kun?&quot;

Tomoyo shook her head. &quot;You said we&#39;ll always be friends, remember?
That&#39;s all I need. It&#39;s what makes me happy.&quot;

Smiling a little, Sakura felt her spirits lifting. &quot;Thanks,
Tomoyo-chan. We will always be friends,&quot; she reconfirmed, &quot;It makes me
happy too.&quot;

&quot;No matter who you choose tomorrow, I&#39;ll always be there for you,
Sakura-chan. And I&#39;ll always love you.&quot;

Sakura felt her cheeks burn as she blushed. She was still nervous about
the idea that her best friend could be in love with her. Pulling up the
staff, she invoked the Fly Card. &quot;Ready to go home, Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hai, Sakura-chan.&quot; Tomoyo smiled to her, sitting with her legs over
one side of the staff.

&quot;I&#39;m so tired, but I doubt I&#39;ll be getting any sleep tonight.&quot; Sakura
sighed and lifted off into the sky.

Once Sakura had left Tomoyo-chan on the terrace outside her bedroom the
Card Captor rose and allowed Fly to go wherever it wanted. Kero-chan
was still missing, but she had more on her mind than the Seal Beast,
who was more than capable of taking care of himself. With a soulful
sigh she glanced down at the town, with its the clock tower silhouetted
against the moon. The clock proclaimed the hour to be 1 AM. Morning
already, Sakura realized with a sigh.

With a thought the Clow Cards in her pocket floated into the air,
forming a circle around her. She felt their presence, their love for
her, and she drew comfort from it. It was a warm feeling. Like when she
had her arms around Tomoyo-chan.

She paused mentally.

No, not like it. It was different. It lacked a sort of excitement.
There was more to the feeling of comfort she had when she had hugged
her friend. Sakura&#39;s mind raced away, trying to put into words the
feeling that was suddenly so very important. But try as she might she
could not find an expression for that feeling.

Pulling Fly to a stop she drew the wand from between her legs, and
began to fall.

&quot;Float!&quot; she cried over the wind, and didn&#39;t wait for the Card to
answer her command before she turned in the circle of Cards, looking
for the one she wanted.

&quot;Illusion!&quot; she yelled, as the wand came down on the Card named. &quot;Show
me my heart&#39;s desire.&quot;

Even as she said it she knew she was cheating, but her mind, exhausted
from the earlier battle, and everything else, was becoming desperate.
She could fly around all night waiting for the lightening bolt that was
Tomoyo-chan to strike her...

Sakura sat down hard, in midair, as the air left her body. She drew a
deep breath, her eyes fighting to focus. She sat stunned for a long
moment, trying to mentally collect herself. Before her Illusion was
beginning to take form, but she no longer cared to wait for the
outcome. Recalling the Cards she returned the wand to Fly and flew as
quickly as possible back the way she came.

Tomoyo stood right where Sakura had left her. Her hands were pressed to
her chest, and her eyes, watching the sky. At first Sakura was unsure
that her friend had seen her return, but as she alighted Tomoyo turned
her face towards the Card Captor. She bore a look of serene peace that
lifted some massive, unknown, weight off of Sakura&#39;s shoulders. Neither
one spoke. Sakura opened her hand and the wand instantly became a charm
around her neck. Her hands now free she silently walked to her friend,
who didn&#39;t move, but watched. When they where within inches of each
other Sakura stopped, and stood swaying for a moment. Slowly she sank
to her knees and slipped her arms around Tomoyo&#39;s small waist. Tomoyo&#39;s
head fell back as she awaited the words that would transform her life.
Sakura, her head pressed against her friend&#39;s hip, allowed her mind to
express the feelings it couldn&#39;t before.

&quot;It&#39;s you,&quot; she whispered.

Tomoyo&#39;s eyes rolled closed, tears spilling onto her cheeks.

&quot;It&#39;s you,&quot; Sakura repeated, no longer surprised. &quot;It will always be
you, it has always s been you.&quot;

Tomoyo&#39;s fingers unlaced themselves and found a new home in Sakura&#39;s
hair. At the contact Sakura looked up at her newly discovered lover.
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot; she wondered aloud.

Tomoyo lowered her head to face her friend. She smiled through her
tears, &quot;You needed to learn for yourself,&quot; was the whispered reply.

&quot;Are you sorry it took me so long to realize?&quot;

A sad smile played on the dark haired girl&#39;s lips, her voice was a mere
sigh, &quot;I was willing to wait a lifetime for you... Sakura.&quot;

Kero-chan stood in the air before Li. They had both seen everything
that happened, and now Kero-chan was ready to defend the lovers if the
need arose. Li watched them for several long minutes before he tore his
eyes away to look at the Seal Beast.

&quot;I&#39;ve lost,&quot; he whispered, &quot;... everything. The Cards, the girl I
love... everything.&quot;

Kero-chan&#39;s tail whipped menacingly, &quot;And what are you going to do?&quot;

Li frowned. &quot;Do you think I would attack them?&quot; he asked, in a sort of
shocked anger.

Kero-chan allowed his silence to speak for him. Li turned his back on
the scene and disappeared into the night.

The day dawned crystal clear and Sakura was out early. It was her
morning to clean the classroom, and she knew Tomoyo-chan would be
waiting for her.

It had been a week since they had come together as a couple. &#39;One week,
six hours and 15 minutes,&#39; Sakura thought as she pushed herself harder,
racing the clock for extra seconds in the company of her friend. More
than friend, she corrected herself with a smile. As she rollerbladed
she relived, for the thousandth time, the feeling of Tomoyo&#39;s hands on
her as the dark haired girl helped her to rise from her position of
worship at her friend&#39;s waist. Felt, again, as Tomoyo&#39;s hands gather
her own, and then drew her into the dark bedroom. Sakura had wanted, so
much, and had slept, so long! She blushed, even now, thinking of it.
Not a good opening for a lifetime together, she mused, but Tomoyo
didn&#39;t seem to mind.

As she came within sight of the school Sakura could make out the form
of Tomoyo-chan waiting for her near the gate. She raised her hand and
waved wildly, the joy in her heart becoming one thought, one word...

&quot;Tomoyo-chan!&quot;
