<h1>Clow Card Booster Pack (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Did you get it?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; Sakura smiled brightly, holding the card high.. 

&quot;As usual, Sakura-chan was wonderful!&quot; Tomoyo spoke from behind the 
video camera.

&quot;So, Kero-chan, what does this card *do?*&quot; Sakura asked, glancing up 
at her little familiar. To her surprise, instead of floating above her 
as usual, he was waving his tawny limbs in alarm as a silent black 
helicopter slowly lifted him away from his friends.

&quot;What on earth?&quot; Sakura reached out to rescue Kero-chan, even as he 
dwindled into the distance.

&quot;Sakura, save yourself!&quot; Kero-chan shouted, his Osakan accent 
extremely pronounced in his haste.

&quot;Kero-chan!&quot; Sakura held her wand out. &quot;Fly!&quot; She leapt up into the 
sky, wings springing from her back as the words left her lips. She 
sped through the air, her attention focused on the magical creature. 
He struggled gamely with the men that were wrestling him into the 
helicopter. Kero-chan shouted something, but Sakura could not hear his 
words over the roar of the wind. 

As she approached the craft, Sakura fought against the downdraft of 
the helicopter. She could just make out Kero-chan, his wings gripped 
by the strange men. 

Dark spots covered his body...bruises, Sakura realized. They had hurt 
him.

Sakura saw red. 

She struggled to come up with a plan, something that would free her 
friend. She flipped through the cards in her mind, passing over the 
benign, the tame...then smiled. It was not a nice smile. As she pulled 
the card from her pocket, Sakura thought with an inner shrug that, 
knowing Tomoyo, she&#39;d probably have found this smile charming, too. 
Then the card was in her hand and she was shouting, even as she came 
within earshot of the helicopter.

&quot;Shot!&quot; she screamed with an anger that was alien to her. She swerved 
to avoid the guns of the men in the &#39;copter. They released Kero-chan 
to focus on their attacker, but they were too late. The little magical 
beast, freed, used the moment to alter his form. In an instant, they 
no longer shared space with a toy-sized being. 

Bullets whizzed by Sakura, but she knew that they would not hurt her. 
&quot;Shield&quot; she cried, laughing horribly, then &quot;Shoot!&quot; once again. 

It was too much for the men in black. Firepower came from nowhere to 
cut their craft into pieces, while inside they were forced to deal 
with a lion-sized and ferocious creature. They shouted in fear and 
defeat &#150; Sakura could hear Kerberos&#39; roar above the noise of battle.

In a matter of seconds, they were gone. The sky was clear, the battle 
over. Kerberos and Sakura returned to earth silently, with only a 
shared look between them to acknowledge the experience.

Tomoyo came running up, camera still rolling. &quot;Sakura-chan, 
Sakura-chan, are you alright?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine, but Kero-chan is wounded.&quot; Sakura&#39;s voice sounded tired and 
old &#150; the voice of a war veteran. 

The camera lowered at that. Tomoyo&#39;s eyes were huge with concern. 
&quot;Wounded? Oh no.&quot; She reached into her purse and made a quick phone 
call. &quot;My bodyguards will be here in a few minutes with some first aid 
supplies. I told them they were for you.&quot; She took a deep breath. 
&quot;What happened?&quot; her voice was edged with more than a little incipient 
hysteria, so Sakura moved forward quickly to comfort her.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but I think it was...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the Conspiracy Card,&quot; Kero-chan said, now once again in his 
miniature form. He looked at the two women with a grimace, then 
slowly, almost comically, passed out on the ground.
