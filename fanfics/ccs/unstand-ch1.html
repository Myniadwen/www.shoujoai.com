<h1>Understanding</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/overstreet.html">Clayton Overstreet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sakura and Madison walked hand in hand to school. The weekend before
they had finally admitted to each other that they were in love. They
had told their friends, who had said they understood, and had thought
that was the end of it. They were wrong.

Sakura first began to notice something was wrong in first period. She
kept getting odd feelings and when she looked up a lot of people were
quickly looking away from either her or Madison. Blushing, she focused
on her work and listening to Miss Makinzy explain the lesson. It wasn&#39;t
easy.

When the class was done Miss Makinzy announced that it was time to go
out for break. Madison and Sakura walked out to the play ground and sat
down by the sand pit where the volley ball net was set up.

Madison looked over at Sakura and smiled nervously. &quot;Is it just me or
were we the focus of a lot of attention.&quot;

Sakura shook her head. &quot;It wasn&#39;t just you. I think we would probably
get less attention if we told them about the card captor thing.&quot;

Madison smiled sadly. &quot;You know Sakura if you want to stop now I would
understand.&quot;

Sakura smiled and shook her head. &quot;You know better than that Madison. I
love you and what anybody else thinks doesn&#39;t matter one bit.&quot;

Madison smiled and hugged her. &quot;Thank you Sakura. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d
do without you.&quot;

Sakura giggled. &quot;You&#39;d die of loneliness, just like I would. Now come
on, let&#39;s get back to class alright?&quot;

Madison nodded and they both got up. As they walked back to the
classroom they were both acutely aware of the stares of most of the
other kids on the play ground. Despite this they both kept smiling and
holding hands. Sakura and Madison had both faced down everything from
the fly card to the thunder card. Neither of them were afraid of a few
odd looks.

The rest of the day went pretty much the same. Hushed whispers, strange
looks, and some laughter behind their backs. They were both intensely
relieved when the lunch bell rang. Madison and Sakura sat down at their
usual table and began to eat. When Nikki and the others started to walk
past them Sakura called out, &quot;Hey, are you going to sit with us or
what?&quot;

The other girls looked at her nervously and Nikki stepped forward.
&quot;Well Sakura, like we said we understand about you two and all that.
But well, we still like guys. And if we sit with you they might
think...&quot;

Sakura frowned and was about to tell them just how stupid that was when
Madison put her hand on Sakura&#39;s arm. &quot;That&#39;s alright Nikki. We
understand. See you later alright?&quot;

They other girls nodded and walked away. Nikki stopped and glanced
back, then continued after the others.

Sakura frowned. &quot;That is so dumb! I can&#39;t believe that they think that
just hanging out with us...&quot;

Madison smiled pleasantly. &quot;Well they&#39;re right Sakura. You&#39;ve seen how
people have been acting around us. For the next few weeks at least this
is going to be a big deal. We just have to give them time to get used
to it.&quot;

Sakura sighed and took a bite of her food. &quot;I know you&#39;re right
Madison. It wasn&#39;t like it was easy for us either. But still...&quot;

Madison nodded and began eating too. Suddenly Lee and Maylin sat down
in front of them. Maylin smiled and Lee looked at them with his usual
grim face. &quot;Hey Avalon, what&#39;s up?&quot;

Sakura smiled. &quot;Aren&#39;t you afraid that sitting with us will damage your
popularity?&quot;

Lee shook his head. &quot;We didn&#39;t move down here to be popular. Anyway you
two are our only real friends around here, so who cares what anybody
else thinks.&quot;

Madison looked at him surprised. &quot;That&#39;s awfully nice of you Lee.&quot;

Maylin nodded. &quot;Well he&#39;s right. And anyway it&#39;s not like he has anyone
to impress.&quot; She leaned her head on Lee&#39;s shoulder. Lee rolled his eyes
but Maylin ignored it.

Sakura smiled at them. &quot;Well thanks you guys. I was beginning to wonder
if we had any real friends left.&quot;

They ate the rest of their meals and talked about the cards they had
been capturing lately. &quot;So how many are left?&quot; Madison asked.

&quot;About fifteen I think.&quot; Sakura said. She looked over at Lee. &quot;There
were fifty two to start with right?&quot;

Lee nodded. &quot;Yes. You know Avalon you really need to study magic if you
want to be a good card captor.&quot;

Sakura blushed and looked down. &quot;Well Kero has been teaching me, but it
takes a while. You two have been studying it all your lives.&quot;

Maylin frowned. &quot;You&#39;ve still got an edge on me. I can&#39;t even capture
the cards.&quot;

Madison looked at her. &quot;Well neither can I, but Sakura is always
telling me that she couldn&#39;t do it without my help.&quot;

Sakura smiled. &quot;Yeah, both of you help out a lot Maylin. Even if you
can&#39;t use magic, right Lee?&quot;

Lee grunted and took a bite of his food. Maylin, however, seemed to be
in a better mood and the conversation turned to more pleasant topics.
The good mood lasted almost until the end of lunch.

As they were heading back to class, one of the boys that they didn&#39;t
know very well made a comment. Sakura didn&#39;t hear much of it, but what
she did hear was her and Madison&#39;s names and the phrase &#39;carpet
muncher&#39;.

Lee immediately punched the guy in the face before Sakura or Madison
could stop him. &quot;When you insult my friends you insult me.&quot; He tried to
go after the guy again but Sakura and Madison were holding him back.

&quot;Lee stop it right now!&quot; Sakura, Madison, and Maylin said at the same
time.

Lee looked at them confused. &quot;But he...&quot;

Sakura shook her head. &quot;Lee I appreciate you trying to defend us, but
you can&#39;t do things like that.&quot;

Madison nodded. &quot;She&#39;s right Lee. You can&#39;t be there every time
something like this happens. Just let us handle it alright? You&#39;ll just
end up getting into trouble.&quot;

Lee stopped struggling, especially since the guy had run away. He
looked at both of then, then bowed. &quot;You&#39;re right, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Maylin smiled and held his arm. &quot;Still Lee, it was very gallant of you
to do that. Would you do the same for me Lee?&quot;

Lee blushed and the three girls laughed at him. Just then the bell rang
and they turned to go back to class. On the way in Miss Makinzy looked
at them. &quot;I want to talk to the four of you after class.&quot; They all
looked down and nodded. &quot;Yes Miss Makinzy.&quot;

After the other students had been excused Sakura, Madison, Maylin, and
Lee stood in front of Miss Makinzy&#39;s desk. &quot;I saw what happened today
during lunch. That wasn&#39;t a very smart thing to do Lee.&quot;

Lee looked down embarrassed and frowned. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Miss Makinzy laughed. &quot;You don&#39;t have anything to be sorry for Lee.&quot;
They all looked up at her surprised. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time since I saw
chivalry like that. But like Sakura said, you can&#39;t fight someone&#39;s
battle for them.&quot;

She looked at Madison and Sakura. &quot;And it is going to be a battle you
know. It hasn&#39;t been easy for either of you two has it?&quot;

They shook their heads and Sakura said, &quot;No, but I&#39;m not ready to give
up just because of what somebody else thinks.&quot;

Madison nodded. &quot;Me either.&quot;

Miss Makinzy smiled. &quot;You know I envy all of you. And not just for the
cards either. Very few people find someone who loves them enough to go
through this sort of thing. And even fewer have friends that will stand
with them.&quot;

Sakura and Madison smiled at Lee and Maylin who stood looking stunned.
Miss Makinzy smiled and pointed towards the door. &quot;You may be excused
now. I will see you all tomorrow.&quot;

They all nodded and headed towards the door. Madison and Sakura smiled
at each other and said goodbye to Maylin and Lee, then began walking
towards Sakura&#39;s house.

When they arrived at Sakura&#39;s home Kero was waiting to be fed. &quot;I&#39;m
starving. Why were you two so late getting back from school?&quot; Sakura
and Madison told him what happened. Kero was actually quite impressed
with Lee&#39;s actions. &quot;I didn&#39;t think he had it in him. Back in Clow
Reed&#39;s time that was the standard of course. He must have been taught
very well.&quot;

Sakura shook her head and handed him a sandwich. &quot;Well this isn&#39;t then.
If we don&#39;t handle our own problems then they will just get bigger.&quot;

Kero nodded. &quot;You&#39;re right of course. But so was your teacher. This
isn&#39;t going to be easy for either of you.&quot;

Madison smiled and scratched Kero behind the ears. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Kero,
I&#39;m sure we can handle it. Right Sakura?&quot;

&quot;Right Madison.&quot; Sakura hugged both of them. &quot;Thanks for helping out
though Kero.&quot;

Kero smiled and ate his sandwich. &quot;No problem kid.&quot;

They went to the living room and watched television until Sakura&#39;s
brother and father came home. After that Madison called her mother for
a ride home.

When Madison&#39;s mother arrived and she was leaving Madison turned back
to Sakura and the two kissed goodbye. &quot;See you tomorrow Sakura.&quot;

Sakura smiled. &quot;Bye Madison. See you on the way to school.&quot;

Once Madison was gone Sakura turned back to see her father and Tory
standing behind her. &quot;Something you want to tell us Sakura?&quot; Mr. Avalon
asked.

Sakura blushed. &quot;Well Madison and I have kind of... become a couple.&quot;

Both of them looked at her surprised. Tory frowned and asked her, &quot;Why
didn&#39;t you tell us?&quot;

Sakura looked at them. &quot;Well it only happened this weekend. And I&#39;ve
been having a few problems at school so I just really didn&#39;t think
about it.&quot;

Tory smiled and nodded. &quot;I see. Well that&#39;s understandable I suppose,
right dad?&quot;

Her father frowned and looked at her. &quot;What kind of problems at
school?&quot;

Sakura told him about how her friends had decided not to sit with them
any more and about what happened during lunch. &quot;It&#39;s no big deal
really.&quot;

Her dad seemed unconvinced. &quot;Sakura I&#39;m not sure if this is a good
idea. I mean you&#39;re a little young to know what love is and you might
be deluding yourself. Maybe you should think about not seeing her for a
while.&quot;

Sakura looked at him in shock. &quot;Dad, I know what I&#39;m doing. Madison
makes me happier than anyone else in the world and I am not going to
stop seeing her.&quot;

Tory started to say something in Sakura&#39;s defense, but her dad cut him
off. &quot;Sakura I think that maybe you should go to your room to think
about this. I&#39;ll send Tory up with your dinner later.&quot;

Sakura looked at her father, feeling like he was betraying her. A tear
trickled down her cheek and without another word she ran up the stairs
to her room.

Tory looked at his dad and said, &quot;Weren&#39;t you a bit hard on her?&quot;

He shook his head. &quot;No, I don&#39;t think so. She&#39;s just a kid. This way
will spare her a lot of pain.&quot;

Tory frowned and walked to the kitchen. &quot;I&#39;m going to make dinner.&quot;

When they got home Madison&#39;s mother asked her to wait a second before
going upstairs. &quot;Madison... I think we need to talk about you and
Sakura.&quot;

Madison sat down on the couch and looked at her. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Well, when I was younger I had a crush on Sakura&#39;s mother, so I know
what you&#39;re going through. I don&#39;t think you should keep seeing
Sakura.&quot;

Madison looked at her. &quot;Why? I mean I&#39;ve been in love with her for
years and now we&#39;re finally together. I&#39;m not going to give her up for
no reason.&quot;

Her mother bit her lip. &quot;Madison, I&#39;m just trying to spare you some of
the pain I went through. I mean eventually she might decide that she
wants to have a baby Madison.&quot;

Madison looked down sadly, then shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t care. We&#39;ll
deal with that ever comes up.&quot;

Her mother frowned. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Madison, but I can&#39;t let you do that.
I&#39;m going to arrange for home schooling now and I want you to not see
Sakura for a while.&quot;

Madison looked up at her in shock. &quot;You can&#39;t do that!&quot;

Her mother shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s for your own good Madison.&quot;

&quot;But mom I...&quot; Madison began.

&quot;I&#39;ve already decided Madison.&quot; She said.

Madison gritted her teeth and ran up the stairs to her room. Her mother
watched her go.

The cell phone in Sakura&#39;s room rang. Smiling she picked it up.
&quot;Madison?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s me Sakura. You aren&#39;t going to believe this, but my mom
wants me to stop seeing you.&quot; Madison said.

Sakura sighed. &quot;My dad is the same way. I can&#39;t believe them. It&#39;s none
of their business anyway.&quot;

Madison laughed. &quot;You&#39;re right. But my mom is saying that she is going
to make me take home schooling so I won&#39;t see you.&quot;

Sakura gasped. &quot;She can&#39;t do that, I mean it&#39;s totally unfair. I don&#39;t
believe... hold on a second, my brother is at the door.&quot; She stuffed
the phone under her pillow. &quot;Come in Tory.&quot;

Tory came in carrying a tray of food. &quot;Hey squirt. Here&#39;s your dinner.&quot;

She smiled. &quot;Mmm, smells good.&quot;

He turned to leave and then stopped and looked back at her. &quot;You know I
think dad was totally wrong.&quot;

Sakura smiled. &quot;Thanks Tory.&quot;

He smiled. &quot;No problem. I&#39;ll talk to him tomorrow after he&#39;s had some
time to think alright?&quot; He turned and left, closing the door behind
him.

Once he was gone Sakura picked the phone up again. &quot;Wow, you&#39;re brother
is being really good about this.&quot; Madison said.

Sakura nodded. &quot;I know. I mean he teases me a lot, but he&#39;s a really
cool guy some times.&quot;

Sakura nodded and took a bite of her food. &quot;So what are we going to
do?&quot;

Madison sounded uncertain. &quot;I don&#39;t know Sakura. I mean what can we
do?&quot;

Sakura was thinking about it when she heard a door open on the other
end of the line. In the background she could hear Madison&#39;s mother.
&quot;Madison I thought I had made myself clear. Give me that phone right
now.&quot;

Sakura listened while the phone exchanged hands. After a second
Madison&#39;s mother said, &quot;Sakura? I would really appreciate it if you
would leave Madison alone for a while.&quot;

Sakura frowned. &quot;Why? We&#39;ve been best friends since we were kids.&quot;

&quot;You are still kids. You&#39;re too young for this kind of relationship.
Now please just leave her alone.&quot; She hung the phone up, leaving Sakura
just sitting there.

Sakura tried to call back, but it was turned off. When she called the
house number the operator told her that the call was blocked. She
looked at Kero who had been sitting on the dresser. &quot;This is so unfair.
How can she do something like this?&quot;

Kero shrugged. &quot;She wants what she thinks is best. for the two of you.
The question is, what are you going to do about it?&quot;

Sakura frowned and bit her lip. Suddenly the Clow book opened and the
cards flew out to surround her. &quot;Kero, what&#39;s going on?&quot;

Kero nodded. &quot;The cards want to help you Sakura.&quot;

Sakura frowned and looked at them, then nodded. &quot;Alright, then I know
what I have to do.&quot;

Madison sat in her room crying into her pillow. All the videos,
drawings, and pictures she had of Sakura had been confiscated by her
mother. She had taken away her cell phone and even went so far as to
delete all of the pictures of Sakura that Madison had on her computer.

Her door creaked as it opened slightly. &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk to you
right now.&quot;

The door opened a bit more, but nobody answered. When she looked up
instead of her mother she saw the visible form of the sleep card
peeking around her door. Madison gasped and her face broke into a huge
grin. &quot;Is Sakura here?&quot;

The sleep card nodded and flew into the room, avoiding her so that she
didn&#39;t fall asleep too. It pointed to the window. Madison got up and
walked over to the window and opened it. The sleep card flew out and
up. Looking outside Madison saw Sakura flying just above her roof.

&quot;Hi Madison, care to go on a little trip?&quot; Sakura whispered.

Madison looked at her worriedly. &quot;You mean like run away.&quot;

Sakura nodded. &quot;Not forever, but maybe long enough to let our parents
know we&#39;re serious. If you don&#39;t want to we won&#39;t.&quot;

Madison smiled. &quot;Just wait a second while I get my coat and camera.&quot;

Madison ducked back inside while Sakura put the sleep card away. She
peeked out her door and saw some of the house staff asleep on the
floor. Quickly she went back into her room and walked to the window.
&quot;How do I get to you? If you land in the yard the security system will
go off.&quot;

Sakura smiled and pulled out the float card. She landed on the roof and
used it to levitate Madison up to her. When she got there Madison
hugged her tightly. &quot;You&#39;re my hero Sakura.&quot;

Sakura hugged her back. &quot;And you&#39;re my princess Madison. Come on, let&#39;s
go.&quot;

They both got onto the wand and flew off into the night. A cold wind
brushed over them and Madison scooted closer to her. &quot;It&#39;s cold
tonight.&quot;

Sakura nodded. &quot;Yeah. We need to find some place to go.&quot;

Madison thought for a minute. &quot;Maybe Lee and Maylin would let us stay
at their place.&quot;

Sakura shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t think so. Their guardian might not want
to get involved.&quot;

Madison sighed and buried her face in Sakura&#39;s hair. &quot;Maybe Miss
Makinzy would help.&quot;

Sakura smiled. &quot;That&#39;s a great idea Madison.&quot; The wand banked to the
left and they headed towards Miss Makinzy&#39;s house. When they got there
they landed and walked over to the door.

Sakura reached up and knocked on the door softly. After a minute Miss
Makinzy opened it and smiled at them. &quot;Sakura. Madison. What are you
doing here so late? Come on in before you get sick.&quot;

They followed her inside and into the living room. Once there Miss
Makinzy motioned for them to sit on the couch. &quot;Now to what do I owe
this visit?&quot;

Sakura and Madison looked at her nervously. &quot;We were wondering if maybe
we could stay with you for a couple of days.&quot;

Miss Makinzy looked at them in surprise. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with your own
homes?&quot;

They told her what had happened and how their parents were acting. She
listened quietly until they were finished. &quot;So we were hoping you&#39;d help
us. If you want we could do chores for you around here.&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;And we&#39;ll do whatever school work you want to give us.&quot; Madison added.

Miss Makinzy smiled. &quot;Well that is a very tempting offer, but you know
I can&#39;t do that.&quot; Sakura and Madison looked down sadly. &quot;But what I can
do it talk to your parents. I may be able to convince them to listen.&quot;

Sakura looked up at her gratefully. &quot;Would you? That would be so
great.&quot;

Madison nodded her agreement. &quot;Yeah.&quot;

Miss Makinzy smiled. &quot;Look, why don&#39;t you two have some cookies while I
call your parents?&quot; The girls smiled and Miss Makinzy brought in a
plate of cookies for them.

While they were eating Madison looked down at the coffee table. &quot;Hey
Sakura, doesn&#39;t that pattern look familiar?&quot;

Sakura looked down and stared in amazement. &quot;It&#39;s a laser board! Does
everyone have one of these except me?&quot;

Madison giggled, then they both stopped as they heard miss Makinzy on
the phone. &quot;Yes, they are both here. Yes they are safe. No I will not
make them go to separate rooms. Please, will you please come here and
talk to me in person? I don&#39;t think that will work. They would just run
away again. No, I got them to agree to not do it if you are willing to
come talk about it. Alright. I&#39;ll see you in a little bit. Good bye.&quot;

She walked back into the room and smiled at them, taking a cookie for
herself. &quot;It seems Madison&#39;s mother was already at your house Sakura.
They are both on their way here now.&quot;

Sakura bit her lip and looked up at her. &quot;Do you think we should be
here when you talk to them? It might help.&quot;

She shook her head. &quot;No. I know it doesn&#39;t seem fair to keep you two
out of the conversation, but I think it will be easier to get them to
listen to me if the two of you remain out of sight until we are done.&quot;

Madison took Sakura&#39;s hand and squeezed it slightly. &quot;I see what you
mean Miss Makinzy, but still it is about us...&quot; Sakura nodded and
squeezed Madison&#39;s hand back.

Miss Makinzy looked at then, then nodded. &quot;Alright, but not at first.
I&#39;ll call you down when it&#39;s time. Is that good enough?&quot;

They looked at each other, then back at her and nodded. &quot;Thank you Miss
Makinzy.&quot;

She smiled. &quot;It&#39;s no problem. It actually makes me feel pretty good
that you came to me with this. Your friends Lee and Maylin still don&#39;t
quite trust me.&quot;

Sakura smiled. &quot;Well maybe if you weren&#39;t so mysterious all the time.
By the way, this is a laser board right?&quot; She pointed to the table.
&quot;Where do I get one of these?&quot;

Miss Makinzy smiled. &quot;I may be able to get you one later. I take it you
feel you could use one?&quot;

Sakura nodded and nervously rubbed the spot in her jacket where the
Clow book was hidden. She was glad Kero had decided to stay at home.

They spent some time talking, killing time until their parents showed
up.

Sakura&#39;s father and Madison&#39;s mother drove to Miss Makinzy&#39;s house in
the same car. She had woken up after the other people in her house and
since they didn&#39;t want to get into trouble, they hadn&#39;t told her. When
she had gone to check on Madison and found her missing nobody could
figure out where she had gone since the security system had not been
set off. She had gone to Sakura&#39;s house immediately, only to find that
Sakura had been missing too. Sakura&#39;s father told her what had happened
with him and Sakura. She admitted that a similar conversation had
happened between her and her daughter. Just them Miss Makinzy had
called to tell them that the girls had gone to see her. Both parents
had immediately asked that the two be separated, but the teacher had
refused. As they left Tory had looked at them and said, &quot;You are both
wrong. You should let them make their own decisions.&quot; Both parents left
without saying anything to him.

As they drove to her house Sakura&#39;s father said, &quot;I think this is all
your fault.&quot;

She looked at him. &quot;My fault?&quot;

He nodded. &quot;I know about that thing you had about my wife.&quot;

She frowned. &quot;But I didn&#39;t even tell Madison about that. And anyway I
told Madison that it would be best for all concerned if they stopped
seeing each other.&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s what I told Sakura.&quot; He said.

The rest of the drive was very quiet and when they arrived at Miss
Makinzy&#39;s house. They got out of the car and knocked on the door.
Inside they heard what sounded like two people running up the stairs.
Then Miss Makinzy opened the door. She smiled at them and asked them to
come in.

&quot;Actually I was wondering if I might just get my daughter and go.&quot; Mrs.
Taylor said.

Miss Makinzy shook her head. &quot;As I told Mr. Avalon the girls only
agreed to wait here for you to show up if I would talk with you.
Otherwise they will just run away again.&quot;

They both followed her inside. &quot;Look, we didn&#39;t want to hurt them. We
just feel that it would be best if they just... waited a few years.&quot;
Sakura&#39;s dad said.

Miss Makinzy looked at him seriously. &quot;And I suppose what they want
means nothing?&quot;

Madison&#39;s mom shook her head. &quot;I know what they are going through. I
don&#39;t want my daughter to go through what I did.&quot;

From upstairs Sakura and Madison listened while the adults talked.

Miss Makinzy nodded. &quot;I see, but I don&#39;t think this is the same
situation. I have seen them at school and while they have been having
their problems, both Sakura and Madison have been handling it well.
Their friends have been helping them out.&quot;

Mr. Avalon rubbed his chin. &quot;Still this is rather unusual. I mean...
well you know.&quot;

Miss Makinzy smiled. &quot;Yes, I do know. But still that is a choice they
had to make and it probably wasn&#39;t easy for either of them. Don&#39;t you
think you should let them decide how to do this?&quot;

Mrs. Taylor looked at her. &quot;Well neither of them seem to be here do
they?&quot;

Miss Makinzy shook her head. &quot;Actually they want to talk to both of you
about it. Girls, you can come down now.&quot;

Sakura and Madison held each other&#39;s hands as they walked down the
stairs. When they reached the living room their parents looked at them.
&quot;You two are in a lot of trouble.&quot; Mr. Avalon said.

Sakura looked down. &quot;I know.&quot;

Mrs. Taylor looked at Madison. &quot;How did you get passed the security
system?&quot;

&quot;Magic.&quot; Madison answered honestly.

Her mother looked mad, but Miss Makinzy interrupted. &quot;Let&#39;s leave that
for another time. Girls, I think you wanted to tell them something.&quot;

Both parents waited, watching their daughters. Sakura bit her lip and
looked at them. &quot;Well we think what you are doing is totally unfair. I
mean we tell you that we love each other and instead of being happy for
us you are pulling a Romeo and Juliet routine.&quot;

Madison nodded. &quot;Yeah. We have enough problems as it is without you two
trying to keep us apart. I mean mom, I know it didn&#39;t work out with
you. But Sakura isn&#39;t her mother and I&#39;m not you.&quot;

Sakura spoke up, &quot;Yeah. You can&#39;t judge how we&#39;re going to end up just
because of what happened to you.&quot; She looked at her father. &quot;And dad, I
know you think we&#39;re too young, but I love Madison. Just as much as I
love you and Tory.&quot;

They stood there in silence for a minute. Then Miss Makinzy said,
&quot;Girls, why don&#39;t you go back upstairs for a minute while your parents
talk?&quot;

They both nodded and turned to go upstairs. As they did Sakura and
Madison held each other close and stopped at the edge of the living
room to look back at their parents. Then they left the room and went
back to the top of the stairs.

Mr. Avalon sighed. &quot;They&#39;re right of course.&quot;

Mrs. Taylor nodded. &quot;Yeah, but that won&#39;t make it any easier on them. I
mean people will talk and then there is the physical aspect...&quot;

He shook his head. &quot;I know. And here I always thought Tory and I would
have to keep boys away from her.&quot; He looked at Miss Makinzy. &quot;You&#39;re
sure they handled the school stuff alright?&quot;

She nodded. &quot;Yes sir. In fact when one of their friends tried to defend
them from a rude comment, they stopped him and insisted that they could
handle it themselves. Your daughters are very grown up.&quot;

He smiled. &quot;I know. But still...&quot; He looked at Madison&#39;s mom.

&quot;I don&#39;t see what we can do. After all if we try to keep them apart
they might run away again. And next time they might not come to someone
who will tell us where they are.&quot; She said.

Miss Makinzy looked at them seriously. &quot;I will promise you that there
is nothing you can do to keep them apart. After all, didn&#39;t you say
that some how Madison got out of your house with the security system,
your bodyguards, and all that?&quot;

Mrs. Taylor nodded. &quot;Yes. And anyway if they are really happy together
I don&#39;t suppose it would be right to force them.&quot;

He agreed and glanced the way the girls had gone. &quot;So we just let them
work it out for themselves then.&quot;

When she got home Sakura looked at her dad. &quot;Am I grounded?&quot;

He looked at her and shook his head. &quot;No, just go to bed alright? You
have school tomorrow.&quot;

She smiled and walked up the stairs. Tory was there and he smiled at
her. &quot;You seem to be in a better mood.&quot;

Sakura nodded. &quot;Yeah. Dad and I talked on the way home. Everything
worked out fine.&quot;

Tory nodded and they both went to their rooms. Once she got there
Sakura changed into her night gown and settled down into bed. Suddenly
her cell phone rang. She reached over and picked it up. &quot;Hello?&quot;

Madison&#39;s voice answered. &quot;Hi Sakura. My mom gave me back my phone and
pictures. I just wanted to say good night.&quot;

Sakura smiled. &quot;Good night Madison. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow. Love you
lot&#39;s&quot;

&quot;I love you too Sakura.&quot; The phone hung up and Sakura pulled the
blankets over herself and smiled. At least things were getting better.
Tomorrow was going to be another rough day, but she knew that after all
this she could handle it. Taking one last look at Madison&#39;s picture on
her nightstand, Sakura closed her eyes and went to sleep.

Author&#39;s note
I realized that there would be some problems if they actually fell in
love. So I wrote this and worked everything out. I mean even if they
really did love each other that didn&#39;t mean everyone would be
supportive. So I wrote this.
