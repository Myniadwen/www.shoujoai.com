Notes

Just a few short things concerning the nature of this short story. So, 
for those who live behind the Moon and cannot guess already this will 
be a place in the future (and right now) for scenes that take place 
during the epic crossover/fusion known as Soul Lights that are of a 
more adult nature or to be more precise those to which a NC-17 would 
certainly apply. These installments can be read individually but make 
the most sense in combination with the main story. They usually are 
set in-between scenes of a certain part of the Soul Lights. While I 
will indicate there, I will not cross-reference in the story directly, 
for now at least.

Now, enjoy.

	A Soul Lights Side Story
	Based on the works of Takeuchi Naoko and all assorted authors

******************************
	
	Kinomoto Sakura was on the first appearance a rather normal 
teenage girl, only three months short of being eighteen, she had an 
athletic build that hinted at regular workouts, a curious mixture of 
reddish-brown hair that was currently unbound and fell over her 
shoulders in considerable length. As first experiences often went, 
they said nothing about young Sakura. To adequately describe her would 
take an expert and probably a couple of hours of your time. In short 
terms Sakura was a overly-gifted mage, time traveler, merged with a 
past life she had just over recent years became aware of and learned 
to accept, notorious Mistress of what were formerly known as the Clow 
Cards and overall an energetic girl that had escaped a timeline which 
had given her deep personal grief that often overlapped her natural 
cheerful and genki character. Of course, that probably only scratches 
the surfaces of what Sakura was.
	The expert on the subject would be the only one suitable for the 
job. Daidouji Tomoyo, junior partner of the recently refunded Neo 
Infinity. She was highly intelligent for her age and had known Sakura 
for nearly a decade now. Ever since childhood she had been the best 
albeit often eccentric friend of Sakura and about two years after 
their meeting had become the girlfriend of Sakura after her time 
travel experiment. Tomoyo had her own gift with magic that was just 
recently discovered during a mission of great risks and sacrifices. A 
mission that had in the end only lead to further deepen their 
relationship.
	So, you could ask Tomoyo if you wanted an absolute expert on 
Kinomoto Sakura... But right now you would probably not get an answer 
since she was currently occupied with vigorously undressing her 
desirable friend and lover with a precision and carefulness as if the 
redhead was a saint. Those who knew Daidouji Tomoyo though would 
attest you that this was most likely the exact thing that came close 
to the girl&#39;s regard of Sakura.
	Not that Sakura would protest against the delicate touch, far 
from it. As both hands briefly slipped under the mage robe that she 
had worn for her work just minutes ago, a low moan rumbled forth from 
deep within her throat. Tomoyo&#39;s touch was exquisite, she was 
delicately running her fingers around Sakura&#39;s small yet supple 
breasts, just teasing the tiniest bit before retreating. Tomoyo moved 
her hands down, now over the silken material again, finally reaching 
the belt.
	&quot;Naughty,&quot; the slightly - albeit relatively - older girl with 
the exotic blend of black and purple hair - the colors having settled 
somewhere in between after her own traits of her past life had been 
acquired - stated, &quot;You plan on wearing that outdoors?&quot; In truth 
Tomoyo&#39;s leer all but showed how much she would mind that particular 
idea. With the same slow precision as before she proceeded to slide 
the deep blue robe completely off of Sakura&#39;s body, revealing to her 
delighted eyes that the bra hadn&#39;t been the only undergarment that had 
been missing.
	The redheaded Card Mistress smirked at the clear lust reflected 
in her mate&#39;s eyes. Once again appearance was vastly overrated. On the 
outside still teenagers that clearly shouldn&#39;t show such deep 
understanding and displays of mature sexuality, Sakura and Tomoyo 
neither cared about the prudent Japanese traditions that much - 
especially not in their own home - and in fact both of them were much 
older already in mind than their age reflected. Especially so in 
Sakura&#39;s case...
	Briefly Sakura&#39;s mind wandered back to the beginning of their 
sexual experiences, to an event that dated back almost four years now 
and that, while not entirely by their own conscious control, had been 
the first of many major steps in their still young relationship.

******************************

Surely something of this had to be Love&#39;s influence that was 
influencing the area with its powerful magic. Either that or Sakura 
would have had no explanation how a young girl barely of age to be 
called a teenager had the experience and skill necessary to bring 
sighs, moans and groans to her lips, her breath coming in panting 
intakes of air from just the simple sensation of Tomoyo&#39;s hands on her 
bare, young breasts. While Sakura was certainly not really versed in 
the art of same sex interaction, she had done this with Syaoran in her 
old timeline and thus remembered well enough the general mechanism and 
what would elicit the most pleasure from herself. Therefore the Card 
Mistress had had no doubt that she would have to guide her girlfriend 
and soon-to-be lover through the process...
	Kinomoto Sakura always underestimated the resourcefulness of 
Daidouji Tomoyo when it came to knowing just exactly what was the best 
for her.
	Her dedication and insight had left the young mage often 
wondering if they hadn&#39;t swapped bodies somehow before they even met 
and that was why Tomoyo knew her so well. Right now though, Tomoyo was 
acting on a pure instinctual level, not having any pre-knowledge of 
how to really please a woman. Oh, she had hacked... ahem, found her 
way onto some adult websites a little before their trip, having 
already harbored the suspicion of Sakura&#39;s growing desire. Tomoyo was 
many things but surely not one to go into a situation unprepared, 
especially not when it happened to concern her favorite subject.
	Right now the purple-haired heiress left a trail of butterfly 
kisses in the valley between Sakura&#39;s breasts before coming around 
from the underside and slowly running her tongue in circles over the 
tender flesh. Quite frankly, regardless of the preparation most of 
what Tomoyo did was on an unconscious level. She just somehow knew 
exactly what to do. Not about the sex part but what was necessary to 
give her girlfriend the utmost pleasure. The knowledge was just there 
and Tomoyo draw from it without thinking.
	The effect on Sakura was evident as the brown-haired girl threw 
her head back in a deep guttural moan of sheer happiness. Tomoyo had 
found the tiny areola, circling it first before applying light 
suction. &quot;To-Tomo-chan...!&quot; Sakura gasped, her hands in Tomoyo&#39;s hair, 
openly encouraging her to continue the action which the other girl was 
only to happy to oblige with.
	Sakura though was a very competitive girl and while she was 
reluctant to do anything to end the exquisite treatment at the rate 
Tomoyo was ravishing her she might have her tired out before she could 
give her love equal pleasure. And that would simply not do. Hissing in 
a cat-like manner, Sakura used the opening provided when Tomoyo was 
about to switch breasts and pulled the other girl up to her level. The 
startled look quickly was washed away under the passionate and hungry 
kiss, the Card Mistress wasting no time in plunging her tongue deep 
inside the younger - relatively seen - girl&#39;s mouth. Tomoyo moaned and 
relented control immediately.
	Sakura knew that they probably would not be able to remain 
standing much longer with the rate their passionate encounter was 
affecting them. Her own top long discarded, the brunette mage slipped 
her hands under the straps of Tomoyo&#39;s bikini, slipping of the one 
piece bathing suit with the intent of being slow and careful but 
ending up with being rather hasty. Not that Tomoyo had anything to 
complain about as Sakura almost immediately began her assault.
	While the purple-haired girl had mostly acted on instinct and 
just a tiny bit of technical knowledge, Sakura&#39;s advanced experience 
was quite evident as the latter mixed with instinct and improvisation. 
Tomoyo who never had experienced such sensations before was helplessly 
writhing under the onslaught. Sakura was practically everywhere, her 
hands from lightly stroking to pinching her extremely sensitive 
nipples while she practically devoured Tomoyo&#39;s face with hungry 
kisses on either side before moving down her throat and upper body.
	The normally gentle girl who always seemed to be unaffected by 
even the most dangerous situations felt herself grow weak in the knees 
and thus did not resist when Sakura gently lowered her to the floor. 
She didn&#39;t even notice how cold the cave floor was against her naked 
body and the initial chill was quickly replaced by a moderate warmth 
which she didn&#39;t pay much more attention. Her half-lidded gaze was 
fixed on Sakura though who was now setting a slower, almost torturous 
pace upon her breasts, drawing all sorts of interesting sounds that 
you usually would not hear from Tomoyo.
	The girl&#39;s soft cries were music to Sakura&#39;s ears. Having 
completed the task of getting her girlfriend to lie down - ensuring 
with a quick use of Firery that the cave floor wouldn&#39;t cause them a 
cold -, the Card Mistress now set to work her magic on her long time 

best friend, girlfriend and now lover, stimulating the surprisingly 
well-developed globes underneath her lips very, very slowly.
	Finally Sakura switched tactics to a little more aggressive 
kind, taking one nipple in her mouth and applying just a little 
pressure with a wee bit of teeth involved. The result was predictable 
as Tomoyo fully let go of her reservation and the scream echoed all 
around them, reflected by the cave&#39;s walls.
	As distracted as Tomoyo was by the surprising pleasure given 
from the treatment that had elicited a small jolt of momentary pain - 
totally insignificant in comparison - she failed to notice her lover&#39;s 
actual intent and therefore gasped out loud when she felt gentle but 
insistent pressure against her exposed nether regions. Sakura&#39;s hand 
had reached its destination, using the provided distraction to hide 
its path successfully. Sakura briefly glanced up from her position 
into stormy blue eyes, vibrating with passion and unconditional trust 
that told her all that she needed to know. Dipping her head back down, 
at the other breast this time, she mirrored her action from before 
with a similar reaction. Down below one finger slowly pressed forward 
through purple pubic hair, careful in not to hurt the sensitive and 
tight passage. The motion was a little awkward at first but eventually 
Sakura managed to apply just the right combination of carefulness and 
a pace that would guarantee Tomoyo&#39;s first orgasm of her life in no 
time at all.

******************************

	Years had passed since then and the young lovers had altered 
their bedroom play - well, it was not always restricted to the bedroom 
- to more advanced methods that were as much experimental as they were 
more conscious. Their first time had been curious and slightly awkward 
driven by an instinct and a healthy bit of magical influence.
	Sakura caught Tomoyo&#39;s hands in her own and redirected them in a 
way that now Tomoyo was virtually stripping herself through gentle 
persuasion of her lover. The redhead was careful to not even touch an 
inch of skin herself - the temptation was hard to resist though - as 
she proceeded to have Tomoyo discard her own dark green nightgown. 
Here and there she led the slightly taller girl&#39;s hands to glide over 
exposed skin, producing small whimpers at the delicate but much to 
slow treatment from Tomoyo.
	Finally both girls were joined in mutual states of undress and 
Sakura stepped closer to press her body up against Tomoyo&#39;s, breasts 
rubbing against each other and their nether regions briefly touching 
as both girl&#39;s lost themselves in the delightful battle of tongues.
	Okay, time for the surprise, thought Sakura as she had her arms 
currently wrapped around her mate&#39;s body and thus was able to hide 
what she was doing with her hands. Tomoyo was in a state of blissful 
unawareness, having surrendered to the pleasure her Sakura was giving 
her body. She had no problem with letting the older girl set the pace. 
While a few months older herself in age, Sakura was the far more 
experienced of the two of them. Not that there was that much 
difference given that Sakura and Syaoran had just began to explore 
that part of their relationship when Pandora emerged. However, Tomoyo 
had found out that her friend by nature was a very competitive one not 
only in terms of athletics but also during sexual interaction which 
lead to a more aggressive, dominating attitude. She wasn&#39;t sure if 
that was a resident trait of Sakura&#39;s past life but was only to happy 
to surrender to the Card Mistress&#39; ministrations.
	Sakura pulled back slightly, breaking their frantic French kiss. 
Her golden eyes were blazing with passion but for a moment were 
overshadowed by a deep seriousness. In a soft voice she asked her 
partner, &quot;Do you trust me?&quot; The question was a rhetoric one and they 
both knew it. There was no one else in this world that Tomoyo trusted 
more than the genki girl who had captured her heart from day one. 
Sakura smiled radiantly at the absolute, unconditional love reflected 
in those blue eyes. Before Tomoyo had time to react her redheaded 
angel disappeared from view and just a moment later a cry sprang forth 
from her lips when her nether lips were suddenly attacked by furious, 
unrelenting tongue, lips and just a tiny bit of teeth. Another gasp 
escaped the dark-haired girl as waves of pleasure crashed through her 
body, rising in intensity with every new one.
	Tomoyo had barely time to wonder about the young mage&#39;s course 
of action - after all Sakura was usually one to stimulate every inch 
of her body before even thinking about getting serious down there - 
before another set of arms slipped around her from behind and the 
appropriate hands began to fondle her breasts with a precision and 
quality that was coming so close to Sakura&#39;s that she wasn&#39;t able to 
tell the difference. Her passion-induced mind only managed to relate 
the comment for a startled sound resembling more a moan than a gasp of 
surprise.
	Craning her neck slightly, her eyes came to rest on the features 
of another girl with reddish-brown hair and the unique set of golden 
eyes that belonged to her Sakura... who was still busy eating her out 
and had her on the brink of her first orgasm this night. 
&quot;Mirror-chan...?&quot; was the only thing she managed to get out before the 
combination of Sakura&#39;s merciless mouth and a preciously-timed, gentle 
twisting of her nipples with the added sensation of another female 
body pressed against her set of Tomoyo&#39;s release in form of a 
thunderous crescendo that momentarily whitened her vision.

******************************

	A couple of minutes later Tomoyo had decided for herself that 
she was in heaven and didn&#39;t mind at all the surprise that might have 
at least invoked doubts at any other given times. Truthfully though, 
this hadn&#39;t been the first more kinky variation to their lovemaking. 
She had discovered not too long ago that Sakura enjoyed a good dose of 
_variation_ and while she was at first a little skeptical, the young 
heiress had found out to her own surprise that she more than liked to 
indulge in similar sex play. Physical interaction with Sakura was 
certainly not boring.
	This wasn&#39;t the first incident involving the cards either. The 
Card Mistress had told Tomoyo many times that the cards loved her just 
as much as their new owner and were only too happy to &quot;help out&quot;. 
Somehow she doubted Clow had had this in mind when creating the cards 
but Sakura turned out to be rather innovative with her use of the 
element but also the other cards in aiding the experience of 
stimulating Tomoyo&#39;s body. Until now, none of them had taken a really 
active role such as this one.
	Daidouji Tomoyo decided silently that this was a damned shame!
	Currently she was totally besides herself, her mind having flown 
off to some ethereal plane under the twin assault of Sakura and her 
double imitated by Mirror. At any other time she might have been able 
to actually determine who was who, since as good as Mirror was in 
imitating, Tomoyo could always tell the difference by feeling alone. 
Unfortunately - or fortunately depending on your point of view - the 
trembling of her whole nervous system was preventing any form of even 
remote concentration and so she could only marvel at the astonish 
display of attention the two Sakura&#39;s were bestowing upon her. Mirror 
was not only copying her mate to near perfection, her movements were 
the very nature of her namesake. It was as if a mirror was positioned 
in the center above Tomoyo, only that the image on the other side was 
all too real for her senses.
	For the outside observer the way the two Sakura&#39;s carved a path 
over and around their helpless victim&#39;s body appeared as if the 
dark-haired girl was a beautiful picture and they were framing it. 
Starting from Tomoyo&#39;s lips, to her cheeks, neck and then over her 
throat, around her shoulder blades and along her arms, stopping 
briefly to suck on each finger with the same synchronization before 
coming around the other side and moving down over hips and towards her 
thighs. Here the twin redheads stopped to take an experimental lick 
that jolted Tomoyo off of the bed in sheer rapture from that small 
contact alone, having been exposed to the sensation of tiny mini 
orgasm from the double treatment already.
	After resuming their motion down the legs the two identical 
girls stopped just short of Tomoyo&#39;s center - to her clear 
disappointment. Exchanging looks in the same mirroring fashion the two 
slid up their lover&#39;s body, skin rubbing against skin until they 
reached the well-developed globes of sensitive flesh mounting Tomoyo&#39;s 
chest. And as one they proceeded to do the same to them as to the rest 
of the body.
	Tomoyo at this point really had no idea why they had never done 
that before.

******************************

	Tomoyo would be screaming her lungs out if not for the other 
task her mouth was only too eager to perform. It was hard to even 
think one coherent thought and she had really no idea if it was Sakura 
or Mirror she currently was lapping up love juices from. Had she been 
in any state of mind to appreciate the fact that Mirror - given that 
it was really Mirror - could actually copy everything down to the 
exclusive cinnamon smell of Sakura&#39;s cum, she would have been 
suspicious as to just how exactly Clow had been able to do that... As 
it was Tomoyo was far too preoccupied in driving her own tongue in and 
out of the girl currently sitting on her face and clearly writhing in 
delightful ecstasy at her quite skillful motions. The task was also 
serving to distract her from the otherwise barely bearable feeling of 
by now four fingers playing in her own vulva with just the right 
amount of force to set a pace and momentum to rival an actual male 
member - not that Tomoyo had any experience in that direction.
	For Sakura&#39;s part it was an... interesting experience to say the 
least. Seeing herself with her thighs pressed tightly around the head 
of the girl she loved more than life itself. She wasn&#39;t jealous or 
anything, after all it had been her idea. No the sight was arousing 
her to no end and she was nearly on the brink of an orgasm herself 
just from watching. The young mage increased the tempo of her strokes 
and slowly inched her thumb over the hypersensitive nub of Tomoyo&#39;s 
clitoris. Mirror was clearly enjoying herself, articulating sounds 
that did not hint at all that she wasn&#39;t exactly human but just a 
magical sprite. Sakura reached out with one hand to touch her twin 
reflection&#39;s breasts, running her palm over swollen flesh. She had had 
her doubts if that was really going to work the way she had planned it 
but now Clow&#39;s successor was positive to have made the right decision. 
And if the slurping sounds and whimpers were any indication, Tomoyo 
was enjoying herself immensely.
	The air was by now charged with magical electricity, creating a 
very potent field of stimulation that was further heightening the 
experience for them. And when Sakura with one final thrust of her 
fingers and a careful timed flipping motion of her thumb sent her 
lover into the outer space, the feedback generated from the mystical 
energies exploded right upon her own center and served to not only 
bring Mirror off from Tomoyo&#39;s oral reaction to the mind-blowing 
release but Sakura as well.

******************************

	Several minutes later Tomoyo was still trying to re-anchor what 
was left of her rational mind, her body feeling all over limp and 
spent from a treatment she had believed impossible before. However, 
Sakura was not only the Mistress of the Cards but also a Mistress of 
kinky sex as she sometimes teased her partner in the manner of a sort 
of nickname. Especially when it came to inventing new methods 
previously unheard of, applying both Card&#39;s magic and her own gifts 
and knowledge that was at her past life&#39;s disposal.
	&quot;Hmm,&quot; the dark-haired girl rasped out in a near-purr, currently 
sandwiched between two Sakura&#39;s. &quot;This definitely is a new favorite 
place to be.&quot; Tomoyo had her eyes closed, savoring the moment while 
blocking out the sensation of a spinning room until the aftershocks 
had completely passed. &quot;You are too good to me, Sakura-chan. I wanted 
to help you relax and now I didn&#39;t even get you off myself one time.&quot;
	Sakura exchanged a knowing look with Mirror and the smile they 
traded was not just a result of the card mirroring its Mistress&#39; 
movements. They were both rather pleased at the obvious success. &quot;Oh, 
I don&#39;t know. Normally it&#39;s you who is entirely too good to me, 
Tomo-chan. I think this is just a fair compensation.&quot;
	Blinking a couple of times Tomoyo briefly fought the reflex of 
closing them again at the sight of twin pairs of golden orbs looking 
down on her with love and fondness. There was a bit of a difference 
though that Tomoyo - now that she was readjusting her wits - was quick 
to pick up. Sakura&#39;s eyes shown with an unconditional love that sprang 
all boundaries, a distinct quality that was impossible to copy. Mirror 
was in almost all aspects perfect in mimicking her Mistress but the 
saying that the eyes were the mirror of the soul was not just some 
poetic nonsense.
	And Sakura was aware of that of course. That is why she was 
momentarily confused when Tomoyo tilted her head to whisper something 
in her double&#39;s ear that she couldn&#39;t pick up. Touching her lover&#39;s 
shoulder she gently turned Tomoyo towards her. &quot;I am here,&quot; she stated 
with a lopsided smile, thinking that she must have really blown Tomoyo 
somewhere far away.
	The grin of success quickly melted into surprise though. &quot;I 
know,&quot; Tomoyo smiled back and before Sakura had time to even react she 
found her limbs bound, hands stretched above her head and her feet in 
a similar predicament further below, ropes of white light holding them 
in place as Tomoyo had applied a new variation of the Laphas Seed 
spell that she had practiced recently.
	Crawling over from her lying position so that she was 
effectively straddling Sakura who could just stare in helpless wonder, 
Tomoyo made a show of licking her lips in eager anticipation. But it 
was not the heiress who made the first move. Sakura felt lips pressed 
against her neck and out of the corner of her mind could see just 
enough that Mirror had obviously shifted into a mirror image of her 
lover.
	Tomoyo grinned like the proverbial Cheshire cat. &quot;Now, it&#39;s time 
for some payback.&quot;
	Sakura was in no position to protest.
