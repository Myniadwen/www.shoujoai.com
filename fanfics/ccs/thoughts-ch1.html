<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/forever3330.html">Forever3330</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	Sometimes I wonder if it&#146;s worth it. Sitting on the sidelines, 
holding everything swirling around in me back, building wall upon wall 
around my true heart, trying to lock it away, all so that I can give 
her, to the best of my ability, what she deserves. Someone who loves 
her, who can protect her and her precious heart, who can help her to 
shine more brightly then she already does, who can give her a life. A 
marriage, a family, a reason to live.
	My treacherous heart is torn in two; I love her! I can protect 
her! I can help her shine more brightly! But when it comes to the 
last, I stop. Everything simply grows cold and I force a smile, just 
from habit, as I feel the familiar despair and reason wash over me. I 
can&#146;t give her a life. Not a marriage, not a family. And how, how 
could I possibly give her a reason to live, when I couldn&#146;t do those 
simple things?
	And so I cry tears that aren&#146;t tears. They don&#146;t exist, they 
don&#146;t cause me to cry out in grief; because they don&#146;t exist in the 
world where you can see and feel them. They only exist within me, as I 
cry my way through eternity. But why do I do such a thing?
	A simple answer, I suppose. I do it for her. For her happiness. 
For her heart. It&#146;s the only path I can see. It&#146;s the only path there 
is. I would do anything for her; but that leaves me trapped, in a 
prison I helped to make.
	I can&#146;t leave. That would only hurt her. I can&#146;t. I can&#146;t stay; 
that only causes me to die further inside of myself, pulling back, 
only barely remembering to wear my smiling mask. But I have to stay. I 
can&#146;t hurt her. If I would truly do anything for her, then surely I 
can do so simple a thing as be there through all the pain. No matter 
what. Even if I eventually kill my own heart in the effort of trying 
to stay, to not hurt the heart I treasure above all others.
	But I&#146;m starting to wonder if that isn&#146;t true. I&#146;m beginning to 
be unable to feel anything but the emotions I have for her, and the 
emotions that I stand for her. Despair, loneliness, hope, love, and 
endless longing, those too many to name, and worst of all reason. Is 
reason even an emotion? Whatever it is, it is by far the worst thing 
to have.
	Or the best.
	Without reason, wouldn&#146;t I have ruined the life I&#146;m so carefully 
trying to build for her? Wouldn&#146;t I have lost any chance of her 
happiness? Wouldn&#146;t she hate me?
	Most people would hate me, I&#146;m sure. For something I can&#146;t help, 
something I never asked for, never meant to fall into&#133;and I could do 
nothing about it. As long as I wear my masks at least I can be near 
her.
	I wish it would stop. The confusion, all of it. Every emotion 
that swirls through me, the life I don&#146;t want to live that I do want 
to live. It would be easy to stop it all. But I can&#146;t. My prison seems 
to grow into something I can&#146;t escape more and more as my desire to 
escape it grows. I can&#146;t, I can&#146;t, I can&#146;t, I wish&#133;
	The last word I hear echoing through my mind, as everything 
quiets, letting me rest, is &#145;why&#146;. Why? Why? Why&#133;
	Why does anything happen? I don&#146;t really know. I don&#146;t know 
anything at all, in a way. Does anyone know everything? If someone 
does, could they come and explain to me once more why? Can they 
explain that stupid, silly word that always ends my battles within 
this prison?
	Can they explain why?
	I don&#146;t want this. I don&#146;t want to be forever wandering though 
this dark place. I don&#146;t want any of it. I don&#146;t&#133;
	But I do.
	I want the small, treasured moments where I have the light she 
gives me. The light that eases the pain away, that forces the darkness 
and the prison back. Sometimes the light makes me want to break my 
masks. Sometimes it helps me to fix them, and reminds me why I do any 
of this at all. But mostly the light leaves me with the smallest, 
weakest hope. The most hope I can manage. The hope that 
someday&#133;someday&#133;
	I don&#146;t really know.
	The hope that she&#146;ll save me, I guess. That&#146;s silly, I know&#133;you 
have to save yourself. No one saves you. No one can, when you&#146;re so 
close to invisible as I am. But how am I to save myself when it takes 
all my strength to keep alive? It takes all of me to show that smile I 
have to give, to make them all think I&#146;m okay. I&#146;m always okay. I have 
to be. If I show that I&#146;m not, I could break it all&#133;she can&#146;t worry 
about me. I can&#146;t have that.
	I can&#146;t really think anymore. I&#146;m broken, I think. Broken. I 
don&#146;t think I can be fixed by anything but the one thing I can&#146;t have. 
Absurd, isn&#146;t it? That I can&#146;t find the strength to save myself, but I 
can find it in me to save others from all that I feel? That I can only 
mask everything that goes through my mind? That I can&#146;t ever really 
show all of myself, let the masks drop, let anyone, least of all her, 
stare straight into my eyes and see in one glimpse everything that I 
have to hide?
	All I can think right now it nothing, really. It&#146;s simply an 
empty void. I&#146;m running out of emotions and thoughts. All but those 
that I seem to be cursed with for the rest of my life. I must have an 
endless supply of those; that or she hands them all to me, without 
noticing. You&#146;d think she&#146;d notice. How can she simply pull something 
out without realizing it?
	But that&#146;s one of the things I like about her. She&#146;s too 
innocent to understand the workings of the heart, or of emotions 
themselves. She just needs a few pushes in the right direction 
sometimes.
	But how can I know the right direction?
	I think she&#146;s fallen for him, though. It&#146;s not that hard to see. 
If only they would move far, far away, so that it could all end. So 
that I could make my disappearing act with her none the wiser. But no; 
she can&#146;t leave her home. Her friends, her family. Me. And I haven&#146;t 
the slightest idea why.
	No matter what I say I still can&#146;t convince her that it&#146;s for 
the best.
	And so I sit here on a swing in the park, arguing with myself, 
unconsciously smiling out of habit. Smiling when I feel like crying. 
For once it would be nice to cry. But I wonder if I can cry. I used to 
cry myself to sleep, a long time ago. I don&#146;t think I have any of the 
tears that people would refer to as real left. I think I&#146;m too far 
gone for that. To let it all go and simply cry. To sob. To wail. To 
bemoan your fate.
	Perhaps I&#146;m slightly insane to think that wonderful, but surely 
it is better then this battle I hold within myself. I want them out. 
All the painful emotions. But not the love or the hope. The love is 
something that wouldn&#146;t go away if I wanted it to. And the hope at 
least gives me something to grasp. A rope thrown down into the hole 
I&#146;ve dug myself, beckoning for me to try to climb it, a little. A rope 
that taunts with the thought that someone might descend to help me up, 
or pull the rope back up with me attached.
	I know that the thought I keep trying to obliterate has to do 
with that hope. The hope that it will be her who saves me; the hope 
that I will be saved at all. Why would she save me?
	She doesn&#146;t even know that I need to be saved.
