<h1>Clow Card Booster Pack (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/booster-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Three humans and one magical creature were running. Running as fast as 
they could. Well, the three humans ran and the one magical creature 
flew. But they moved quickly, with a definite urgency &#150; there was a 
Clow Card loose and it had to be caught.

Three pairs of feet ran into the house, through the front room and up 
the stairs.

&quot;This way!&quot; Li&#39;s Lasin board threw out a strong beam of light. It led 
down the hall.

&quot;Your big brother&#39;s room!&quot; Tomoyo gasped. &quot;I hope he&#39;s alright!&quot;

The three humans and one magical creature paused for a mere moment 
outside the closed door then, with more courage than tact, they threw 
the door open and ran in. No more than five seconds had elapsed when 
they reappeared in the hallway, each looking startled. Perhaps Li 
looked a little paler than the others, and certainly Sakura&#39;s cheeks 
were flaming, but they all looked as if they had had a shock.

Slowly, the three humans and one magical creature crossed the hall and 
threw themselves into the safety of Sakura&#39;s bedroom.

They sat in silence for a while, not wanting to meet each other&#39;s 
eyes.

It was, in the end, Tomoyo who broke the silence. &quot;So,&quot; she began 
hesitantly. &quot;I guess we just wait here until...until they&#39;re done?&quot;

&quot;The morning,&quot; Sakura said firmly. &quot;I think this card can wait until 
the morning.&quot;

&quot;Um, yeah...or maybe after Yukito-san has gone home or something,&quot; Li 
suggested, his face scarlet.

The others agreed that might be the best thing, then silence fell once 
again over the room. Kero-chan was curled up into a tight ball and 
saying something over and over that the others couldn&#39;t hear.

&quot;Um,&quot; Li began hesitantly, his face a bright scarlet. &quot;Did anyone else 
notice that that was Yue in there?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t...&quot; Sakura began, but Tomoyo cut in quickly.

&quot;Yes. It was,&quot; she confirmed.

Silence fell for a third time.

Again, it was Tomoyo who broke the tension. &quot;Well, who&#39;d have thought 
that Clow would create a,&quot; she snickered a little, &quot;Yaoi card.&quot; She 
hefted her video camera, as a gleam came into her eye. 

Sakura looked up sharply and pointed at the floor. &quot;Tomoyo-chan, you 
will stay *right* there.&quot;

Li groaned as Tomoyo laughed.
