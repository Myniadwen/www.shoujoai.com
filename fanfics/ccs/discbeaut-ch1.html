<h1>Discovering Beauty (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jbrown.html">James Brown</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Welcome fellow Sakura/Tomoyo fans, or non fans if you&#39;re reading this for
the hell of it. Thanks for coming to read my story, but first, yep, I&#39;ve
got notes. Here we go. There are two terms at the beginning that you 
probably never heard of. Both refer to carnival games that you may have 
seen in certain anime. The first is kingyo-sukui, which is basically the 
goldfish catching game. The second is shateki. In this game, people use a 
pop gun filled with little corks and fire it at a couple of shelves with 
different prizes on them. If the person firing knocks down a prize, it&#39;s 
theirs. Alright, enough of the notes, it&#39;s time for the story. I hope you 
enjoy it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The sun had just begun to set over Tomoeda&#39;s horizon as music filled the
air and the ears of the festival crowd. One of the city&#39;s shrine festivals
was fully underway as the people began enjoying the activities of the late
afternoon: talking in a friendly conversation, playig a game at one of the
festival booths, or, as Sakura Kinomoto was doing, taking a casual stroll.

Sakura was walking by herself as she observed the sights around her. She
decided to stop at a kingyo-sukui booth to see if anyone had caught any
gold fish. The brown haired girl was at the booth earlier, but she had
come up empty handed in her attempts to catch anything. Right now, she was
more content with seeing if anyone else had better luck. Once she finished
watching, Sakura decided to walk a little more, but it wasn&#39;t long until
she noticed her best friend Tomoyo coming towards her.

&quot;Hey Tomoyo!&quot; Sakura called out.

&quot;Oh, hello Sakura,&quot; Tomoyo said once Sakura ran up to her. &quot;I didn&#39;t know
you were here as well. Are you here by yourself?&quot;

&quot;No. Actually, I was with my brother and my dad earlier, but we decided
to separate for now.&quot; It wasn&#39;t until this moment that Sakura noticed
Tomoyo holding an orange stuffed elephant in front of her. As soon as she
saw it, the topic of conversation quickly changed. &quot;Hey Tomoyo, where did
you get that cute little elephant?&quot;

&quot;Do-o you like it?&quot; Tomoyo asked as she began to blush.

&quot;I think it&#39;s adorable.&quot;

&quot;I won it a couple of minutes ago at the shateki booth.&quot;

&quot;Wow, really? Isn&#39;t that kind of hard?&quot;

&quot;Not really. All a person really needs is some patience and a little
concentration. To tell you the truth, I&#39;m going to give this to someone as
a gift.&quot;

&quot;Are you giving it to someone I know?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes. I think you&#39;ve meet this person.&quot;

&quot;Say, I hope whoever you give it to likes it,&quot; Sakura commented with a
bright smile.

&quot;I&#39;m sure of it. Hey, you want to go get something to eat?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; As the two girls went in search for food, Sakura couldn&#39;t help
but think about Tomoyo and who she would give the gift to. &quot;Tomoyo sure is
happy about all this, but, I wonder who is making her smile so much?&quot;

-------------------------------------------------------------------

That evening, after Tomoyo returned home from the festival, the girl
entered her room while she held the stuffed elephant close to her. The
dark haired girl laid down on her bed, holding the elephant up in front of
her as a small laugh emitted from her closed mouth. &quot;Hmm. Once Sakura
realizes that this elephant is really for her, she&#39;s going to be so
thrilled. I just know it, I just know it.&quot; The elephant was more that
just a simple gift between best friends, to Tomoyo, it represented a
confession, a confession of love. Tomoyo held the stuffed animal close to
her chest as she began to think about presenting it to Sakura. Her smile
began to enlarge as the thoughts flooded her mind. But suddenly, a thought
of a different kind came into her mind. &quot;Wait a minute, what if she
doesn&#39;t understand? What if she doesn&#39;t get it right away?&quot; Tomoyo began
to think about what she could include with the elephant in order to get her
message across. Once the idea came to her, Tomoyo went through the house
to get paper, a pencil and an envelope. When the neecded supplies were
gathered, the young girl returned to her room. She sat down on her bed and
began to write a letter. In it, she began to inscribe her true feelings.
All of the emotions in her heart were being put on to paper. Tomoyo&#39;s
hopes and dreams counted on what she wrote in the letter. Her true hope
was that Sakura understood how much she meant to her, and her greatest
dream was that somehow, Sakura felt the exact same way about her. As soon
as the letter was finished, Tomoyo placed it inside the envelope and took
it along with the elephant to her book bag. After she packed the items
inside, she went back to her room with a cheerful smile on her face.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The following Friday morning, school began at Tomoeda Elementary and
Tomoyo had all the necessary items to make her gift to Sakura complete.
Tomoyo decided to wait until all the day&#39;s classes were done until she
presented the gift. After school had ended and the afternoon finally
arrived, Sakura and Tomoyo walked home together. The entire time they
walked, Tomoyo kept thinking about when would be the perfect moment to
unveil her surprise. Once the two were a block away from Sakura&#39;s home,
Tomoyo decided to speak up.

&quot;Hey Sakura. Can we stop for a moment?&quot;

&quot;Why? Is something the matter?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m okay. I just have something that I want to show you.&quot; As Tomoyo
took her book bag off, Sakura became extremely curious as to what she was
going to see. As Tomoyo opened her bag, Sakura&#39;s eyes began to widen once
she saw a familiar orange color. As soon as she recognized the elephant&#39;s
shape, her entire face lit up.

&quot;Hey, isn&#39;t...isn&#39;t that the elephant from last night?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;But you still have it with you. I thought...wait. Do you mean that the
friend you&#39;re giving it to is me?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right Sakura. This gift belongs to you.&quot;

&quot;Oh thank you Tomoyo! Thank you so much!&quot;

&quot;I decided to wait until today to give it to you so I could surprise you.&quot;

&quot;I understand, and thanks again.&quot; As Sakura accepted the gift and held it
close to her, Tomoyo smiled as she watched her friend spin in a delightful
mood. The moment was uplifting to her, and she knew now, as Sakura began
to ask her a question, it was time for her to present the letter. &quot;But,
why are you giving this to me? Is it because I did something recently?&quot;

&quot;Well, I think this well help to answer your question.&quot; Sakura was
puzzled as Tomoyo reached into her bag a second time and pulled out the
letter. When the letter was handed to her, she put down the elephant and
examined the envelope. After finding nothing to read on the envelope
itself, Sakura opened it and began to read the letter out loud.

&quot;Sakura, we have been good friends for a long time now, and as friends, we
have been through a lot of incredible situations together. And through the
time we&#39;ve known each other, I consider you to be my greatest friend.
Whenever I see your smile, it makes me feel happy even if I am already in a
good mood. When I am with you, I know I can tell you any of my secrets
without the fear of hving anyone else knowing. But the secret I want to
tell you now is much different than any I&#39;ve told and it concerns you as
well.&quot; At this point, Sakura&#39;s interest in what she was reading grew in a
vast amount. &quot;My secret is one that I have carried with me for a while
now. I hope that you understand how I feel and that perhaps, you feel the
same way as well. What I want to tell you is that I...&quot; Sakura continued
reading the letter, but found the news to be a total shock for her. So
much so that she was unable to find a voice to read the letter out loud.

When Sakura had finished reading the letter, she looked up to Tomoyo with
an expression on her face, to which Tomoyo acted surprised and concerned.
Sakura&#39;s expression was almost one of fear and confusion. She then
realized she didn&#39;t finish reading the letter out loud. As she continued
reading where she left off, her tone of voice changed. From anticipation,
to a tone that was more dreary. &quot;I love you. In all honesty and with all
of my heart, I love you. My feelings are more than just what common
friends share. They are very much in the romantic sense. You mean
everything to me and I hope you will stay wth me for a long time.&quot; Sakura
didn&#39;t feel any different after reading Tomoyo&#39;s confession. She didn&#39;t
know what to say. She didn&#39;t know what to think. She didn&#39;t know what to
do. Tomoyo finally decided to break the silence with her voice.

&quot;Sakura, w-what&#39;s the matter?&quot;

Sakura tried to say something right away, but found it difficult with all
the thoughts in her head. &quot;I...I...I...&quot; Everything about this situation
was just making her nervous. &quot;I...have to go.&quot; Sakura ran toward her
house and didn&#39;t look back. The letter slowly drifted out of her hands and
landed in front of Tomoyo. Tomoyo was shaken by what had happened. She
never considered this as the result of her actions.

&quot;Sakura? Wait! Why are you running?&quot; She reached out to the distant
girl but found it to be of little help. Alone and heartbrokne, the girl
stood there as bitter sadness flooded her senses. Everything she hoped for
collapsed in front of her. Tomoyo looked at the items that represented her
gift as her eyes began to tear up. &quot;But...but why?&quot;
