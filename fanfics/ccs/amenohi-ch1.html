fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jchua.html">Johann Chua</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Rain poured down as if the very clouds were mourning along with Sakura.

He was gone.

Not even the Mistress of the Clow could raise the dead.

It would&#39;ve been easy to shield herself from the elements, but she
preferred not to. A simple umbrella was all that prevented her from
being completely drenched.

&quot;Sakura-chan.&quot; Tomoyo stood by her side, unattended by her cadre of
bodyguards.

&quot;Please, leave me alone, Tomoyo-chan. I need to do this by myself.&quot;

&quot;I know that the two of you were happy together--but you shouldn&#39;t
throw away your life just because you lost him.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not--&quot;

&quot;Touya said you haven&#39;t eaten in a week.&quot;

Sakura froze as she finally heard her body screaming for sustenance.

&quot;Please...come home.&quot;

She turned and looked at Tomoyo nearly in tears herself. Her friend&#39;s
eyes were crying out, I don&#39;t want to lose you.

&quot;To...Tomoyo-chan.... I didn&#39;t mean--&quot; Sakura choked on her own tears
&quot;--all this time, I didn&#39;t know. Please believe me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d always hoped that you would see how I loved you someday, but I
didn&#39;t want it to be like this.&quot;

The raven-haired heiress paused as the downpour began to ebb then said:

&quot;Sometimes it seems like there&#39;s no hope in sight, but then something
wonderfully unexpected happens.&quot;

&quot;I was happy while you were--&quot;

&quot;I was happy, too--happy for you. At least I tried to be. I knew I
could make you happy, but I was afraid you wouldn&#39;t...understand.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Tomoyo-chan....&quot;

Tomoyo gazed upon her dearest friend and love as Sakura opened her
heart to the one who had always been right beside her.

It was the longest and most treasured moment of their lives.

The rain had stopped half an hour ago.

Golden rays of light caressed their rain-soaked and weary bodies.

Tomoyo&#39;s warmth far exceeded the Sun&#39;s as Sakura lay with her head upon
her best friend and new-found lover&#39;s bosom.

Rainy days never last for long.
