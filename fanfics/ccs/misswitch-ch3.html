<h1>Miss Witch (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/forever3330.html">Forever3330</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/misswitch-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Disclaimer: Hi! This is me, Forever3330, as always! This is the third 
chapter of Miss Witch (I finally got home to work on it!)! I have been 
itching to work on this story for a while, so I shall finally do so! 
Megumi-chan shows up in this fanfiction again. ^^; I&#146;ve taken a 
peculiar liking to her. Anyways, before I get around to doing the 
usual disclaimer stuff I have to report two mistakes I made in chapter 
two: one time I used &#145;here&#146; instead of &#145;hear, and when Sakura was 
explaining about the necklaces she called the bracelets. Plus Tomoyo&#146;s 
&#145;turning, she turned&#146; turned was supposed to be looked. Sorry! 

------------------------------------------------------------

	Megumi smiles cheerfully. &#147;Since I have no wish to get hit on 
the head today I&#146;m being very good! See?&#148; She gets hit on the head 
with a sign reading &#145;Get on with it!&#146;. Megumi sighs. &#147;I swear, by the 
time this is over I will have one huge headache&#133;&#148; She smiles lightly, 
ignoring the bump on her head. &#147;Last time I was here a few interesting 
things happened! Most important of all the two girls met. 
Unfortunately for Tomoyo, even a Guardian Witch can&#146;t sense the Card 
User. She has to actually FIND Sakura. Sakura doesn&#146;t exactly act very 
suspicious. Maybe that&#146;ll change&#133;And Sakura made friendship necklaces 
able to channel magic? I&#146;m not sure what trouble that&#146;ll cause. And at 
the very end we find out that Tomoyo was being eavesdropped on! How 
rude! Anyways, I gotta go! It&#146;s lunch time!&#148; Megumi disappears with a 
wave.
~
	Tomoyo smiled to herself, standing outside Yuri-Bijou 
Highschool&#146;s gates. Watching all the people dash out of the gates, 
glad to be free of school. A few walked, a few skipped. Looking at all 
of them Tomoyo wished that she could stay here forever. But if the 
Card User wasn&#146;t in this city she would simply have to go to a 
different one. The idea didn&#146;t appeal to her much, but she had to find 
the User&#133;
	A hand waved in front of Tomoyo&#146;s stormy blue eyes, and she once 
again focused on the present, forgetting for the time being the 
future. &#147;Hmm?&#148; She looked to the owner of the hand and saw Sakura, who 
smiled once Tomoyo noticed her.
	&#147;You were staring off into space there.&#148; Sakura remarked 
cheerfully. &#147;I kept calling your name&#133;&#148;
	Tomoyo blushed in embarrassment. &#147;Gomen, Sakura-chan. I was just 
thinking about something. It&#146;s not important anyways. Just something I 
promised I&#146;d do.&#148; Tomoyo smiled. &#147;So, where&#146;s your house Sakura-chan?&#148;
	Sakura frowned, then shrugged it off and smiled. &#147;It&#146;s a bit 
far, but we could walk if you like. I usually roller blade, but I 
don&#146;t have an extra pair&#133;&#148; Sakura sweatdropped. Transportation hadn&#146;t 
really been on her mind.
	Tomoyo giggled. &#147;We could always ask Rika-chan to give us a 
ride&#133;&#148;
	&#147;A ride!&#148; Sakura exclaimed. &#147;That&#146;s it! Touya-oniichan was 
driving today! His school is nearby. He&#146;s in college.&#148; The brunette 
explained.
	&#147;I didn&#146;t know you had a brother, Sakura-chan.&#148; Tomoyo smiled. 
&#147;But I&#146;m willing to try and catch a ride.&#148;
	&#147;Good!&#148; Sakura sighed in relief. She smiled. &#147;I&#146;ll catch him, 
daijoubu? You can stay here if you like.&#148;
	&#147;Iie, I think I&#146;ll come with you.&#148; Tomoyo said. &#147;I can run 
slightly well.&#148;
	&#147;If you say so.&#148; Sakura agreed.
~
	Sakura, running her fastest to catch Touya before he left, 
wasn&#146;t sure if Tomoyo was keeping up. Somewhere in her mind she knew 
she was running a little too fast, but if she didn&#146;t catch him they&#146;d 
have to walk home, and that didn&#146;t sound all that nice at the time, as 
it looked like rain.
	A hand gripped hers as she ran, and she noticed Tomoyo running 
along beside her, though a little behind so Sakura could tug her in 
the right direction. The pale girl looked a little hard pushed, but 
other then that she was fine. Sakura slowed down just a bit, and 
turned the corner with her friend, then slid to a halt.
	Tomoyo stopped a bit in front of Sakura, then looked across the 
street from where they stood. &#147;Is that your brother&#146;s school?&#148; She 
asked curiously.
	&#147;Hai.&#148; Sakura nodded cheerfully. &#147;I can see his car in the 
school lot, so why don&#146;t we get over by it before we get trampled?&#148;
	Tomoyo looked over at the brunette uncertainly. &#147;Um&#133;&#148;
	Sakura didn&#146;t notice Tomoyo&#146;s nervousness at her last statement, 
but tugged Tomoyo&#146;s arm, half-pulling her friend across the street. 
&#147;Touya-oniichan&#146;s car is that one.&#148; She pointed with the hand holding 
her school bag.
	&#147;It&#146;s very nice.&#148; Tomoyo said politely, as if Touya were 
actually there.
	Sakura giggled. As they were almost off the sidewalk a bell 
rang. &#147;Uh-oh&#133;&#148;
	&#147;What is&#133;&#148; Tomoyo&#146;s question was cut off as a crowd of students 
suddenly burst out the front doors, trampling anything in there way. 
Sakura jerked her friend out of the way and stood by the car, 
sweatdropping.
	&#147;So you weren&#146;t joking.&#148; Tomoyo said faintly, watching the older 
students run by.
	&#147;Iie.&#148; Sakura said, spotting her brother. &#147;There&#146;s 
Touya-oniichan! Oh! Yuki-san is with him.&#148;
	Touya looked down at his sister in a mixture of confusion and 
surprise when he reached his car.
	&#147;Hello Sakura-chan. Whom is your friend?&#148; Yuki asked, offering 
the two girls candy from a bag he had been holding.
	Tomoyo accepted her piece with a smile, bowing to the two boys. 
&#147;I&#146;m Daidouji Tomoyo. You must be Yuki-san.&#148; Looking over at Touya she 
smiled. &#147;You must be Touya-san, correct?&#148;
	Touya stared. &#147;Um&#133;&#148;
	&#147;This is my friend, Tomoyo-chan.&#148; Sakura said cheerfully. Tomoyo 
bowed again. &#147;I sorta forgot to arrange a way for us to get home, so 
we came here to ask if we could ride home with you.&#148;
	Touya sighed. &#147;You&#146;ll never learn, will you monster?&#148;
	Sakura stomped on Touya&#146;s foot in response. &#147;C&#146;mon, it&#146;s 
starting to rain!&#148;
	&#147;Fine&#133;&#148; Touya grumbled, half confused about his sister&#146;s actions 
as of late.
	&#147;Thank you Kinomoto-san.&#148; Tomoyo bowed for the third time to 
Touya and Yuki.
~
	Touya sighed, looking at the rear-view mirror for the umpteenth 
time since they had left. Somehow, that girl looked familiar. But how?
	The girl in question and his sister were giggling as they 
chattered away.
	Yuki looked over at his friend in concern. &#147;Are you okay, To-ya? 
You&#146;ve been twitchy ever since we left.&#148;
	The two girls looked up, and Touya sweatdropped. Leave it to 
Yuki to pick up on things. &#147;It&#146;s nothing. Really.&#148;
	&#147;If you say so&#133;&#148; Yuki turned back to his sandwich, which was 
some of Touya&#146;s leftover lunch.
~
	Sakura giggled again as Tomoyo told her another story of an 
outing she&#146;d had with her mother. Tomoyo was a joy to watch; she was 
telling the story with all of herself, smiling warmly, eyes bright, 
hands dancing. The girl hardly seemed able to be compared to ghosts, 
as Naoko had commented earlier.
	Tomoyo giggled. &#147;Okaa-san is very kind-hearted though, even if 
she wouldn&#146;t ever admit it.&#148;
	Sakura smiled. &#147;I wish I could meet your Mother sometime.&#148;
	An odd look came into Tomoyo&#146;s eyes, then disappeared. Sakura 
instantly wondered if it had even been there&#133;&#147;Mother isn&#146;t here with 
me. She&#146;s somewhere else, on important business. But when she comes 
here, I&#146;m sure she&#146;d be delighted to meet you.&#148;
	Sakura smiled, unsure. &#147;That sounds great Tomoyo-chan.&#148;
	&#147;Hey, kaijou, we&#146;re here.&#148; Sakura and Tomoyo realized they had 
come to a full stop, and Sakura immediately jumped out, stomping on 
her brother&#146;s foot as he did the same, at a slower pace.
	&#147;I am NOT a monster!&#148; Tomoyo giggled as she slid out through the 
door Sakura had left open.
	&#147;It must be nice, to have a sibling.&#148; She commented, though the 
two couldn&#146;t hear her over their argument.
	&#147;Hai&#133;it must be.&#148; Tomoyo turned her head to smile at Yuki.
~
	&#147;Daddy! We&#146;re home!&#148; Sakura held open the door for Tomoyo and 
Yuki, letting it shut as her brother came up the steps&#133;
	&#147;Arigatou.&#148; Tomoyo said, barely heard over Touya&#146;s yelp.
	Yuki opened the door, looking worried. &#147;To-ya? Are you okay?&#148;
	Tomoyo looked up as she noticed a man sitting in the small study 
to the side of the door. He had silvery hair, and warm eyes and a 
smile. Tomoyo smiled to herself. Sakura&#146;s father.
	She took off her shoes, keeping her socks on , and walked 
silently into the room. The man was looking over at the other three, 
and didn&#146;t notice her.
	Looking around as she entered a small room, the living room, she 
smiled. It was all so cozy. Blinking, she saw a vase full of Nadesico. 
Beside the blue vase was a picture of a strangely familiar woman. An 
enchantingly beautiful woman&#133;Long black curls, pale skin, gentle 
smile&#133;emerald eyes&#133;how&#133;?
	She heard the others enter the room and twirled around, 
startled.
~
	Fujitaka stared for a long while, as Sakura ran up to her friend 
and then turned back to her father, confused. Fujitaka felt Touya 
pause and tense beside him, and Yuki stayed slightly behind Touya, 
oblivious as Sakura, maybe more so, to what was going on.
	The girl next to Sakura was almost a perfect image of the woman 
in the photo. With Sakura beside her, it looked as if you could mix 
the two girls to get a younger Nadesico.
	&#147;Nani?&#148; Sakura sweatdropped, still confused.
	Fujitaka smiled. &#147;Nothing. It&#146;s nothing.&#148;
	Touya sweatdropped, thinking. At least now he knew whom Tomoyo 
had reminded him of.
	Sakura shrugged it off and smiled brightly. &#147;Daddy, this is 
Daidouji Tomoyo, my best friend. Tomoyo-chan, this is my father.&#148;
	Both Tomoyo and Fujitaka bowed, saying something about how it 
was such &#145;a pleasure to meet you&#146;.
	&#147;Thank you for your hospitality Kinomoto-kun.&#148; Tomoyo said 
graciously.
	&#147;You can call me Fujitaka-sensei, if it helps.&#148; Fujitaka smiled. 
&#147;I&#146;m a professor, and I feel better being called by my name.&#148;
	&#147;If you say so.&#148; Tomoyo smiled.
	Sakura turned to her friend cheerfully. &#147;C&#146;mon! I&#146;ll show you my 
room!&#148;
	After the two girls had run upstairs the three men stood in 
thought, but for Yuki who just looked slightly confused. &#147;What&#146;s wrong 
To-ya?&#148;
	&#147;She looked&#133;&#148; Touya started.
	&#147;That girl looks so much like Nadesico. My wife.&#148; Fujitaka 
smiled, leaving the two to think.
~
	Tomoyo yawned slightly, glancing over at the yellow stuffed 
animal again, and getting the feeling that something wasn&#146;t quite 
right. But what? The stuffed animal in question seemed to tense up. 
She must be getting tired.
	&#147;Oh, Gomenasai&#133;are you tired?&#148; Sakura looked up from the 
collection of stuffed animals she had been showing Tomoyo, looking 
apologetic.
	&#147;Just a little.&#148; Tomoyo admitted reluctantly, smiling sweetly.
	&#147;We can go to bed now.&#148; Sakura glanced at the clock and 
sweatdropped. &#147;Eeks! It&#146;s late! I was having so much fun I didn&#146;t 
notice&#133;&#148; She rubbed the back of her head, laughing nervously.
	&#147;Should I go ask for a sleeping bag?&#148; The heiress smiled 
sleepily.
	&#147;We can share my bed if you want. I think Daddy is asleep, and I 
don&#146;t want to bother Touya&#133;&#148; Sakura sighed.
	&#147;That sounds fine.&#148; Tomoyo had already slipped into the bed. &#147;I 
think I&#146;ll just&#133;&#148; She trailed off, mumbling slightly, as her eyes 
closed.
	&#147;Is she asleep?&#148; The stuffed animal seemed to whisper.
	Sakura glanced at Tomoyo. &#147;Hai. But if she hadn&#146;t been, you 
would have been in trouble.&#148;
	&#147;I think she&#146;s on to me&#133;like your brother&#133;&#148; Kero floated around 
Sakura&#146;s head, fretting.
	&#147;Don&#146;t be silly.&#148; Sakura yawned. &#147;I think I need sleep&#133;&#148;
	&#147;But what about my dinner?!&#148; Kero sighed. Sakura was already in 
bed and asleep. &#147;Fine. I&#146;ll just starve.&#148;
~
	She was in the park&#133;night was already there, and she seemed to 
be wearing her school uniform, Sakura wand ready. Of course, she 
always wore her school uniform. What else would she wear?
	&#147;Sakura. I think it&#146;s near&#133;&#148; Syaoran stood beside her, scowling, 
arms crossed. Kero floated between them, and Yue stood back.
	&#147;But I&#146;ve caught all the cards&#133;&#148; She heard herself say sleepily.
	&#147;It may not be a card. There will always be something to fight, 
Sakura.&#148; Kero answered thoughtfully.
	Then to the front of her, a bright light suddenly shown, and a 
figure became visible. Tomoyo turned, a surprised look on her face. 
That wand Sakura held&#133;the Guardians beside her&#133;and that boy from 
school, standing with a sword pointed in her direction.
	Sakura stared at the strange purple-black dress Tomoyo wore, her 
hair a darker mix of violet and black, a strange hat that she would 
call a Witches hat upon her head. In her hands was a ball of light.
	&#147;Are you it?! Are you the source of this evil?!&#148; Syaoran lunged 
forward, as Tomoyo gave a half-smile and fell back in a dead faint, 
black light clouding her.
	&#147;Tomoyo!&#148; And then the shadowy figure behind the girl became 
visible.
~
	Both girls woke in the morning, at the same time. Sakura stared 
at Tomoyo, wondering about the strange dream, but shoved it away as 
Tomoyo smiled rather dizzily. After all, she could ask Kero later.</pre>
