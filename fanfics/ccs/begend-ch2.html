<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kamui.html">Kamui Ikari</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/begend-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>When the night came over Tomoeda, the old woman was going to her house.
The mysterious person was beside her. After a time she reached her
house, it was a big house. The woman looked for her keys, when she got
them she opened the door.

She turned to the mysterious person, the person had something in her
hands. The old woman looked at the thing.

&quot;I want to take care of this,&quot; the old woman said.

&quot;What?&quot; the other voice said.

&quot;That I want to keep this. It&#39;ll be safe with me. This thing is the
entire reason of what we&#39;re planning&quot; the old woman said.

&quot;Us. We&#39;d planned this, but we needed your help. You&#39;re not pushed in
our plan,&quot; the other voice said.

&quot;I&#39;m involved because I agreed with both of you on this, I&#39;m part of
this plan. Besides if this thing is with both of you Sakura will find
it and the plan will be crushed before she finds her true feelings.
It&#39;s important that Sakura must realize her feelings, no matter what,&quot;
the old woman said.

&quot;Are you sure that you can keep this?&quot; the mysterious voice said.

&quot;Sure. I want to keep this&quot; the old woman said smiling.

&quot;Take care of it please&quot; the other voice said as the old woman received
the thing.

&quot;It&#39;s better that both of you must go, before she... &quot; the old woman
said as she entered in the house.

&quot;We know, please take care&quot; the mysterious voice said.

&quot;Of this thing and yourself&quot; the other voice said.

&quot;I know&quot; the old woman said as she closed the door. &quot;Now, we must
return before Sakura finds that...&quot; the other voice said.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, she is so busy that she won&#39;t feel our presence,&quot; the
mysterious voice said.

&quot;I wonder what will happen from now on&quot; the other voice said.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. But I have faith in Sakura, no matter which path she
will take. Even if she takes the same path&quot; the mysterious voice said.

&quot;You mean, the same path of Clow Reed?&quot; the other voice said.

&quot;His path was different. Her path is not the same as his&quot; the
mysterious voice.

&quot;Sakura...&quot; the other voice said.

&quot;She will become Clow Reed in a some way but she&#39;s Sakura Kinomoto&quot; the
mysterious voice said.

&quot;My faith in her is high, like Tomoyo&#39;s. She didn&#39;t disappoint me, and
passed the trial of the Clow Cards Judge&quot; the other voice said.

&quot;Yue...&quot; the mysterious voice said.

&quot;She must deal with hard things from now, but she is Sakura&quot; the other
voice said.

&quot;The New Clow Mistress and the Most Powerful Mage in the World&quot; the
mysterious voice said.

******

Sakura stopped her memory again and coughed up some blood. She cleaned
the bloodstains from her mouth and leaned her head on the ground, she
felt her entire body weak, the pain she was feeling was the worst but
she smiled to herself. The cards were floating in the air as the
moonlight covered Sakura, the Light came to her mistress.

&quot;If you keep going like this you...&quot; the Light card said.

&quot;I know, but I want to continue, if my body will rip into pieces, my
bones breaking like glass, my heart being shattered from pain, I won&#39;t
stop myself, because this is I want.&quot; Sakura said smiling weakly.

&quot;I understand but them?&quot; the Light card said.

&quot;I just hope that the two of them can understand. It&#39;s my decision&quot;
Sakura said as she laughed.

&quot;Why are you laughing?&quot; the Dark card said.

&quot;Because I&#39;m feeling like Clow Reed in this moment, maybe I&#39;m Clow
Reed&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;No, you&#39;re Sakura Kinomoto&quot; the Light said.

&quot;A person never can become another, even twins will have the same or
similar bodies but are different, you&#39;re unique as every person of this
world&quot; the Dark said as she sat beside Sakura.

&quot;Yes. I&#39;m Sakura Kinomoto&quot; Sakura said as she caressed the Light&#39;s
cheek.

&quot;You&#39;re Clow Reed in a some way, but you never will become him&quot; the
Dark said.

&quot;I finally realized what I am now, in what I&#39;ve became. If everything
goes right then...&quot; Sakura said as she coughed up blood again.

&quot;Sakura...&quot; said the Light.

Sakura smiled at the Light.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about me&quot; Sakura said as she started to remember again...

*******

Sakura was walking to her house, her head was down and tears falling
down her cheeks. The wind was blowing against her body. She didn&#39;t care
about that. She was deep in thought, she could only think of Tomoyo.
Sakura heard Tomoyo&#39;s voice inside her head, she smiled sadly and
started to remember when she met Tomoyo for the first time, the things
done together, everything.

&quot;Why did you leave me, Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;Why did you have to go?&quot; she asked again.

&quot;I thought we were the best friends, forever. Why did you have to die
that way?. I never told you how important you are to me. I need to see
you again. Please let me see your face again... please... I have the
ability to see spirits. I promise that I won&#39;t be scared of you but
please... I need to see you again Tomoyo-chan... you don&#39;t know how
much I need you...&quot; Sakura said with tears in her face.

Silence covered her.

&quot;Tomoyo...&quot;

She walked to her home again, when she entered she sat on the table.
Yui was making some food. Sakura started to cry again. Yui embraced
her.

&quot;Oh Sakura...&quot; Yui whispered.

&quot;Why...&quot; Sakura said crying.

&quot;I know it&#39;s hard, but sooner or later you must accept that she&#39;s gone
and never coming back. You must think that she only wanted you to be
happy, it&#39;s sad when we lost things that are dear for us, but we must
go on in this world. I&#39;m sure that Tomoyo-san is looking for you from
where she is now&quot; Yui said calmly.

Sakura stopped her cry and smiled briefly at her.

&quot;Thank you, mother,&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;Sakura, I told you many times before Yui is right for me. You don&#39;t
have to call me mother if you want.&quot; Yui said smiling.

&quot;No, I want to call you mother because you&#39;re my mother now. You&#39;re my
father&#39;s wife&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;But I will never become your real mother, the one who gave you life&quot;
Yui said.

&quot;I like to call you mother, because I&#39;m happy to have a mother. My
father was so lonely before meeting you, I&#39;m glad that he&#39;s happy with
you now.&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;If you want to call me mother, do it&quot; Yui said.

&quot;Thank you, mother&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;Ah, Li-san called asking for you&quot; Yui said.

&quot;Oh, I understand&quot; Sakura said, then she left the kitchen and went to
her room, she picked up her phone and dialed Li&#39;s number.

&quot;Hello, Syaoran speaking&quot;

&quot;Li-kun...&quot;

&quot;Sakura? How are you? Are you okay?&quot; he asked with worry in his voice.

&quot;I suppose I&#39;m fine, but I don&#39;t know. It was so sudden. I don&#39;t
know...&quot; Sakura said sadly.

&quot;I know. It&#39;s hard,&quot; Syaoran said with concern in his voice.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;For asking you to leave me alone&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to. I understand that happened so sudden, and maybe you
needed some time to resolve some things&quot; Syaoran said.

&quot;Yes, but I didn&#39;t come in terms about this. I think that I&#39;ll need
more time, sooner or later, I will overcome it but for now I need to be
alone. I hope you can understand&quot; Sakura said sadly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I understand. Please take the time you want. I will wait
for you&quot; Syaoran said.

&quot;Thanks, Li-kun&quot;

&quot;I love you, Sakura&quot;

&quot;Me too, Syaoran&quot;

Sakura hung up the phone and picked up a blanket. She sat on the floor
and covered herself with the blanket and let her thoughts come in her
mind...

Meanwhile the old woman was in her bed and looking to the shattered
sky.

&quot;I hope everything will end well, it&#39;s a pity that I won&#39;t see it when
that happens&quot; said the old woman.

She looked to her nightstand, there was a picture of her and a girl
embracing with a smile in their faces. She smiled sadly as she touched
the picture and remembered her painful moments after the death of her
beloved. After a long time the old woman stopped her memory and
prepared herself for sleep. She looked to the thing that was also in
her nightstand.

&quot;Good night, my love&quot; she said to the picture.

&quot;Good night to you too&quot; she said to the thing.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re still dreaming nicely&quot; she said to the thing and fell to
sleep.

Meanwhile, Sakura was deep in thought, trying to find the answers to
her questions. In her mind three sentences were there.

&quot;I love you, Sakura. I&#39;ll tell you when you&#39;re older&quot; Tomoyo said to
Sakura when they were ten years old.

&quot;I&#39;m happy, because Sakura-chan is happy.&quot;

&quot;The true happiness is seeing the one you love happy.&quot;

These three sentences were fixed on Sakura&#39;s mind. She did her best
efforts to find it&#39;s connection.

&quot;Why did Tomoyo-chan always say those words? Why?&quot; she asked.

&quot;What must I realize about her?&quot; she asked to herself.

She felt tired and fell to sleep.

******

Sakura stopped her memory again and rose, still bleeding and needing
the staff to maintain herself. Suddenly the cards started to float in
the thin air, she coughed blood again but she clutched herself to the
staff. Slowly she lifted her head to see the Light card.

&quot;You will keep going on this, won&#39;t you?&quot; the Light asked.

&quot;Yes, but it&#39;s time to start what I&#39;ve planned&quot; Sakura said smiling.

&quot;I see&quot; the Dark said.

&quot;I have faith that everything will go right, it&#39;s the only opportunity
that I have with this plan. I can&#39;t lost this chance&quot; Sakura said.

&quot;No one will stop you from now on. Will you keep going on your plan no
matter what or who are in your front?&quot; the Light asked.

&quot;Yes, no matter what or who,&quot; Sakura said with determination in her
face.

&quot;Then follow your plan, we&#39;ll obey you in anything you will need,&quot; the
Dark said.

&quot;Thanks, all of you, my friends&quot; Sakura said smiling.

The Dark card gave Sakura an object, Sakura clutched it tightly against
her bleeding chest.

&quot;I blamed myself for being the person that I was before, but I will not
make the same errors from now. Everything will go right, I promise to
all of you&quot; Sakura said.

The Dark and the Light nodded and the rest of the cards still floating
in the air surrounded Sakura, slowly a circle of magic was forming on
the floor. Sakura was on the center of the circle, and clutching her
baton, she started to whisper something. But she felt a presence, and
turned to see, then her face turned into a sad one.

Syaoran was there, dressed with Chinese clothes, the clothes were
different from the ones he used when he was young, in his right hand
was his sword, in his left hand a spell. Sakura turned her head and
clutched tightly the object in her chest.

&quot;So, you finally became the head of Li family, didn&#39;t you?&quot; Sakura
asked not seeing Li.

&quot;How do you know?&quot; Li asked.

&quot;From your clothing, I suppose. That&#39;s the clothes of the family head&quot;
Sakura said.

&quot;Yes, Sakura. I&#39;m now the head of my family,&quot; Syaoran said to her.

Sakura turned to see Syaoran, she smiled sadly.

&quot;You came trying to stop me?&quot; Sakura asked.

&quot;You&#39;re making a mistake, I can&#39;t let you continue with this. In other
words. Yes, I came to stop you&quot; Syaoran said.

With that Syaoran held his sword in front of him. The spell in his left
hand started to burn covering his hand with fire. He closed his eyes,
he inhaled and began to chanting, energy was coming from his body and
mixed with the flame of his hand, the new energy surrounded the blade.
Sakura whispered for The Mirror card to protect her. The Mirror Card
was in front of Sakura protecting her.

Then Syaoran buried his sword in the floor, his attack broke the
circle. All the cards were in front of Sakura, ready to protect her.

&quot;You can&#39;t stop me, Li-kun&quot; Sakura said sadly.

&quot;Why not?&quot; he asked to her.

&quot;Do you know what I&#39;m planning?&quot; Sakura asked him.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t know what are you planning, but I must stop you because I
believe you&#39;re making a mistake&quot; he said.

&quot;I&#39;m not making a mistake, but I promised myself that no one will stop
me, even if that one is you...&quot; Sakura said smiling sadly as she
coughed blood again.

&quot;Yes, I can. I&#39;m the head of Li family, Clow Reed&#39;s descendants&quot;
Syaoran said to her.

&quot;And I&#39;m also descendent of Clow Reed in some way, but I&#39;m Sakura
Kinomoto...&quot;

&quot;The Most Powerful Mage in the World and the Mistress of Clow Cards,
but they&#39;re now the Sakura Cards&quot; Sakura said as the Sakura Cards
turned into their spirits form.
