DISCLAIMER:

I do not own Card Captor Sakura. CLAMP does! Other companies do! However, I used
their characters and ideas without permission. Still, this is just for fun, and
I&#39;m not capitalizing on this, so please, don&#39;t sue me! X_x
Be forewarned: This tale doesn&#39;t contain explicit yuri scenes, but it&#39;s a
sh&ocirc;jo-ai story nonetheless (love between girls). Enjoy!

***

READ THIS PLEASE:

Before reading this you should&#39;ve read Chapter I ^^ Please, read it before to
get a better understanding of this part. Domo arigato!
In this part I&#39;ll switch from Tomoyo&#39;s. Don&#39;t ask why. Just read. However, I&#39;m
almost sure that from now on I&#39;m only going to use a witness POV, and switch
from POVs from time to time... The story needs it ^^ It&#39;s really annoying (and
shows my lack of good writing skills XD)... but I can&#39;t figure any other way of
developing the story. Gomen! :P)

Japanese terms new to this part:

1) Nani: This little midget translates to &quot;What?&quot;
2) Masaka: Translates to &quot;It can&#39;t be!&quot; (if you&#39;ve seen a lot of anime in
   japanese you shold ve VERY familiar with this word ^^)
3) Rokush&ocirc; Tama: &quot;Verdigris sphere&quot; is one of the attacks of ________ (read ^^).
4) Tonikaku: &quot;At any rate, anyways&quot;
5) Hai: Means &quot;Yes&quot;

Sakura stood alert in the middle of the park. It looked like the card would stay
hidden. She stood there for a long time, until that happened. I threw my video
camera to the hard cobblestones of the park. My head started to feel weird and I
heard this weird voice on my sub-conciousness. A cold feeling started to wrap my
body. I was very dizzy and couldn&#39;t even move. I panicked!

&quot;Oh no! This can&#39;t be!&quot; I thought. &quot;If this card controls me... No! I can&#39;t bear
the idea of hurting Sakura-chan!

I was still concious of my actions. However, some unknown force thwarted my free
will. I was possesed. I couldn&#39;t decide what to do. My body started to obey the
commands of this evil Clow Card and move on it&#39;s own. I started to get very
worried about Sakura. I didn&#39;t care about me... I just wanted to protect
Sakura-chan!&quot;

&quot;Look Sakura!&quot; Kero yelled. Sakura inmediately noticed something was wrong with
me.
&quot;Sa.. Sakura!&quot; I don&#39;t know how I managed to say that. My whole body felt like
a eight ton rock. Perhaps my love for her made me stronger. &quot;R... RUN AND BE
SAFE!!!&quot;

Sakura shocked at the sight! Oh, God... Poor Sakura! I felt horrible. Only a few
hours ago the incident with Naoko-chan... and now I was the root of her
uneasyness.

&quot;I can&#39;t!&quot; She cried. &quot;I CAN&#39;T LEAVE YOU, TOMOYO-CHAN!&quot;

I noticed some tears started to run down her rosy cheeks. I wanted to cry too,
but my eyes were dry and hard... I could barely feel them. I started to feel a
great pain in my whole body. My mind was trying to resist to the attempts of the
wretched Clow Card, but it was all in vain. After a while of futile resistence,
The Control finally took charge of me.

I started to run towards Sakura-chan. Now my real self couldn&#39;t do a thing. I
still felt the inmense pain... My soul was crying. I was very worried for
Sakura. Sakura stood still, waiting for me. I tackled her very hardly and she
flew away. My strenght was also boosted due to the magic effects of this Clow
Card. I couldn&#39;t believe I was the one harming Sakura. I noticed how she rolled
on the cold cobblestone floor of the park plaza, and the skin of her knees
scratched. It was unbearable for me. I was fighting with Sakura-chan. The
feeling of pain grew even bigger than before.

&quot;SAKURA!!!&quot; I cried louder than ever. The tears began falling. &quot;PLEASE! RUN
AWAY!&quot;
&quot;NO!&quot; She said gasping. I could feel the pain she was feeling. &quot;I WON&#39;T LEAVE
YOU TOMOYO-CHAN! I&#39;m responsible for what happened to Naoko-chan, AND I&#39;M NOT
GOING TO LEAVE YOU!&quot;

Sakura got up once again. She started to tremble. Little droplets of blood were
dripping from the tears of her skin. I won&#39;t be able to forgive myself! I know
it&#39;s not my fault! I&#39;m being controlled by the card, but... Now it was really
overwhelming. The pain grew even more... And I lost it... The pain was gone, and
I saw only black. Cold and lonely black...


&quot;Sakura! You need to seal the force first!&quot; Kero said to Sakura.
&quot;How on earth can I do that?&quot; Sakura yelled. &quot;I don&#39;t have the slightest idea on
how can I free Tomoyo from the influence of the magic energy.
&quot;You DON&#39;T need to free her at all...&quot; Kero mumbled. &quot;You must think of a way to
get The Control out of her. That&#39;s the only way.
&quot;Hoe!&quot; Sakura started to cry once again.
&quot;Don&#39;t be such a crybaby!&quot; Kero said. &quot;Remember what Tomoyo said!&quot;

Sakura&#39;s eyes were wide open. She started to remeber what Tomoyo-chan said
earlier. She remembered that she promised to be a courageous Card Captor. She
needed to regain that confidence, and she needed it back fast.

&quot;I know. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find a way to free Tomoyo from the card! I MUST SAVE MY
DEAR TOMOYO!&quot;


Tomoyo let a scream. Maybe it was from the unbearable pain she felt. The fact
was that her face changed. Her gaze was different... She looked evil. Sakura
noticed this. She got ready for an inminent attack. But to her surprise it
wasn&#39;t a physical attack. Tomoyo started to levitate. She rose from the soil
until she reached about two meters. Then she stopped.

&quot;Hoe! What&#39;s happening!?&quot; Sakura was puzzled.
&quot;This is not right! This card isn&#39;t wild!&quot; Kero was very worried.
&quot;NANI?&quot; Sakura cried out.
&quot;This is planned... The Control couldn&#39;t manage to prepare something like this
on her own...&quot; Kero said, thinking about it...
&quot;I don&#39;t get it!&quot; Sakura said in a deep confusion.
&quot;I mean that this card is already working for someone... There is another Card
Captor near here. I can feel a great mana presence.&quot;


In fact Kerberos was right. Mana, the magical force that maintains the delicate
equilibrium of the world, was showing it&#39;s presence there. Suddenly, Tomoyo-chan
started to glow, and a magic emblem appeared on the cold floor, directly under
her feet. I was very complex and featured a lot of details and inscriptions in
the ancient language of the magi.

&quot;Masaka!!&quot; Kero was shocked.
Sakura was too worried and perplexed to even try to say something. Her mouth was
opened. She was too confused.
&quot;What do I need to do?&quot; She cried.
&quot;I don&#39;t know Sakura!&quot; chuckled Kero, not believing the great amount of magical
energy he felt. &quot;The Control must be somewhere. Maybe if you try hitting her...&quot;
&quot;But where is she!!! WHERE IS SHE!!!&quot; Sakura cried harder.


The strange Tomoyo was still floating at a couple of meters from the soil. She
opened her eyes and looked directly at Sakura-chan. Her gaze was evil and
lifeless. She looked like she was dead. This new vision of horror was all that
Sakura needed to lose it. She fainted.

&quot;SAKURA-CHAN!!!&quot; Kero screamed when she saw Sakura falling to the ground.

Kerberos got near Sakura. She didn&#39;t move. Her eyes were completely closed. She
was only breathing, but if she didn&#39;t wake up soon, Tomoyo would kill her. The
possesed Tomoyo closed her eyes once again. She extended her right arm, and
opened her hand. The palm of her hand started to emit a light green glow, and a
little version of the powerful magical emblem appeared on the pale skin of her
palm. A bigger one appeared around her wrist and this one started to spin
slowly. It was a morbid spectacle of deadly magic. The light began to
concentrate on a little sphere on Tomoyo&#39;s hand, and this little orb of mana
began to grow. It&#39;s green light was very bright. Tomoyo was ready to strike
Sakura with the spell anytime soon...

&quot;SAKURA!!&quot; Kero cried out loud. &quot;YOU MUST WAKE UP!&quot;
Sakura didn&#39;t move, and Tomoyo was ready to throw the ball of magic at them.
&quot;So this is it...&quot; Kero said softly, waiting for the strike.

Tomoyo opened her eyes. She had a smirk painted on her devil-like child face.
She laughed and said with an out-of-this-world voice:

&quot;Rokush&ocirc; Tama!&quot;

The sphere of green light popped up a bit and the started to fly down at Sakura
at an unbelievable speed. Kero thought this was their end, but..

&quot;God of thunder!!&quot; said a familiar voice from behind.

A thunder came darting from behind. The sparks impacted the sphere of green
energy. The orb was deflected and it impacted right behind Tomoyo-chan. It
exploded on a big cloud of green mist and energy. It almost looked like hot,
burning plasma.


Li Syaoran made it right in time. If he were a minute later, sakura would&#39;ve...
At any rate, all was over, or at least for now. The Control lied there on the
floor. A few meters from her lied Tomoyo&#39;s body. Kero noticed Li was there.

&quot;You&#39;ve come at the perfect time, brat.&quot; he said at Li.
&quot;Watch you tongue, asshole...&quot; Li said.
Kero was really angry. &quot;Tonikaku, help me with Sakura.&quot;

Li leaned to see Sakura. She was all right, and she slowly opened her eyes.

&quot;What happened?..&quot; she asked Li, slowly getting on her knees.
&quot;It&#39;s over... The card is defeated. Now you must seal it...&quot; Li said, blushing
a little. He was starting to feel uneasy whenever he was near Sakura-chan. &quot;You
must do it quickly Sakura...&quot;
&quot;What about Tomoyo?&quot; Sakura&#39;s eyes openened more. &quot;IS SHE OKAY?&quot;
Li nodded and pointed to where Tomoyo was lying. Sakura was overjoyed and a few
tears of happiness escaped from her eyes. &quot;Oh, thank you god...&quot;
Sakura began to run to Tomoyo, but Li moved his arm and grabbed hers. &quot;Daij&ocirc;bu,
Sakura-chan?&quot;
&quot;Hai!&quot;

Sakura ran as fast as her wounded legs allowed her. She reached Tomoyo quickly.
Inmediatly she leaned her head, getting near to Tomoyo&#39;s. She was still
breathing. And Sakura could finally breathe peacefully again. Sakura embraced
Tomoyo and started to cry.

&quot;Oh, thank you god.&quot;

Li stood up and looked at Sakura. He felt happy for her, but at the same time
felt a deep sadness withing him. He was starting to fall in love with her, but
she knew that even if Sakura tried to love him, her real feelings were for
Tomoyo-chan.


Tomoyo slowly opened her eyes and noticed that Sakura was embracing her. She
started to weep and returned the embrace.

&quot;Sakura-chan...&quot; Tomoyo said between gasps. &quot;Please, forgive me!&quot;
&quot;No...&quot; Sakura said, placing her soft hands on Tomoyo&#39;s white cheeks. &quot;Its okay.
It wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot; A few tears of joy rolled down her cheeks.
&quot;Sakura is worried about me... Sakura... I love you so much.&quot; Tomoyo thought,
closing her eyes.

Li was dissapointed. He wanted to be with Sakura like that... But he knew that
wouldn&#39;t happen. He went close to the sweet couple.

&quot;Sakura, you must seal the card fast...&quot;
&quot;Hai!&quot; she answered.

Sakura stood up, and Tomoyo did too. Tomoyo had one arm clasped around
Sakura-chan&#39;s waist. She was still shocked and wanted to hold Sakura. To feel
she was really all right. After a while, Sakura went near the body of The
Control. The card was lying on the cold soil, trembling. She slowly opened her
eyes and looked at Sakura.

&quot;I&#39;m going to seal you.&quot;
&quot;Do it if you want...&quot; the card said, sadly. &quot;I&#39;ve already failed my master,
Emeraldo.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; Sakura asked.
&quot;Seal me already!&quot; the card cried out. &quot;My master won&#39;t receive me! I FAILED
HIM!&quot;
&quot;Hoe!&quot;

Sakura didn&#39;t understand what was happening at all. She only knew that this
Emeraldo was the previous owner of The Control, whoever he was. Sakura proceeded
to seal the card, and she finally did it. The Clow Card flew from the air until
she reached Sakura&#39;s hand.

&quot;So this is The Control...&quot;


Meanwhile, in the rooftop of a nearby building, a mysterious silhoutte was
looking at the events in the park. The hair of the figure was flowing with the
cold breeze of the night.

&quot;She&#39;s stronger than I thought.&quot; The subject smirked. &quot;It won&#39;t be too long,
though... So wait for it, Sakura...&quot;

***

stuff, trying to destroy Sakura&#39;s life. Tomoyo, as usual is going to be very
