<h1>Whispered Words of Comfort</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ritsutai.html">Ritsuko Taisen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was another lazy afternoon in the Tokyo suburb where the privileged 
Kinomoto family lived; a short drive away from the even more privileged 
Daidouji family.  The two were joined in a truly inseparable way, not 
only by the elder generation, but also by the younger.  The old 
relationship between Sakura&#39;s mother and Tomoyo&#39;s mother was a quiet
family secret, but a secret that allowed few people to be surprised once
Sakura and Tomoyo themselves became quietly romantically involved.  

On the outermost shell, they were best friends, and students at 
Tomoeda Elementary.  Beneath that veneer was Card Captor Sakura, the
champion of the legendary Clow cards and her intrepid scribe and
&quot;sidekick,&quot; always ready with a new costume and better camera angle.
But farther still were two young girls just beginning to explore the
emotions of love and the physical feelings of intimacy with the only
ones they trusted enough... each other.  Pathos love had turned into
eros love... and perhaps into something more?  

Alas, things were far too complicated for that.

This lazy summer afternoon, the two girls were lying together in 
Sakura&#39;s bed, Kero having decided to tactfully fly about the city on the
down-low on patrol.  Tomoyo lay on her back, her long black hair
scattered behind her, her arm around her darling Sakura-chan, who lay
with her head on Tomoyo&#39;s chest.  Both of them were naked, the covers
only as far up as their waists, the warmth of their bodies and the
summer heat penitrating the air conditioned home daring them to expose
their nudity for the sake of remaining cool.  

Sakura shifted lightly, one of her arms draped across Tomoyo&#39;s 
waist... she could feel the remnants of their lovemaking on her inner
thighs, an unusual feeling at best.  She felt dirty on the one hand, and
yet, also strangely happy because it was something that she and her
lover had produced.  She was still so new to all of this... all of this
&quot;sex&quot; stuff.  It still felt odd to say the word, or even talk about
it... and yet, laying here with her lover--the both of them only the
tender age of ten--it felt so natural.  So right.  How could it possibly
be a &quot;bad thing?&quot;

&quot;... Tomoyo-chan...&quot; she whispered softly, a silent query to see if she
was awake.

&quot;Yes, Sakura-chan?&quot; her lover responded, smiling softly... of course 
she was awake.  If she had slept, she would have not been able to enjoy 
such a marvelous moment with her Sakura!

&quot;... You... you know we can&#39;t do this forever...&quot;  

Tomoyo shifted a bit, wondering silently at the sudden sad shift of 
Sakura&#39;s mood and conversation.  &quot;... What do you mean, Sakura-chan?&quot;

The young cardcaptor moved her head to bring her bright green eyes to 
look into the blue-grey of her lovers&#39;, &quot;... We can&#39;t ever get married 
or have children.  And... I&#39;ve heard that being a l-... l-...&quot;

Tomoyo smiled softly.  &quot;&#39;Lesbian&#39;?&quot;

Sakura winced slightly, &quot;Yes... a... lesbian... is a very hard life.&quot;  
Her young eyes then looked a bit pleading, &quot;... But... I love you, 
Tomoyo-chan.  I really don&#39;t want this to end....&quot;

Tomoyo leaned her head down briefly to kiss Sakura&#39;s forehead, then 
leaned back again, hugging her tighter with one arm.  &quot;I know, 
Sakura-chan.  I... I also know that you have your eyes on Yukito-san...
and sometimes, on Li-kun?&quot;

The passive partner blushed furiously, half-hiding her face in Tomyo&#39;s 
chest.  &quot;Y-yes...&quot;

The other girl let a gentle laugh escape her lips as she brought a 
hand up to gently run through the locks of brown hair on Sakura&#39;s head,
a bit tousled and tangled in places from their romp, but she avoided 
those as best she could.  &quot;... Sakura-chan, my mother says that to be
good in business, you must sometimes be aggresive, others submissive,
and other times pragmatic.  That&#39;s a fancy word that means that you
have to know when to give and when to take, and to do whatever you can
to be practical in getting what you want...&quot;

Sakura nodded a bit, her eyes locked on her lover, listening to her 
strangely sage wisdom.  

&quot;... I know that I can&#39;t fade into time with you, Sakura-chan.&quot; Tomoyo 
continued, &quot;But I also know that these times with you will be memories 
I will cherish for the rest of my life.  The love we share is a love 
that no one else will share.  It&#39;s yours and mine only.&quot;

Sakura nodded gently, muttering an affirmative &quot;Mmmm.&quot; 

&quot;... If being with Yukito-san or Li-kun will make you happiest in the 
end, then that is what I will bless and even work to protect.  
Because... I want to see you happy, Sakura-chan.  I love you that
much...&quot;

Another deep blush from the cardcaptor as she moved up a bit to be 
eye-level with her lover.  The two shifted a bit to lie side-by-side,
arms wrapped around each-other, torsos gently touching in the tender 
embrace.  &quot;... Tomoyo-chan... why do you love me?&quot;

The dark-haired girl smiled softly, brushing her lips against Sakura&#39;s 
cheek.  &quot;Your eyes.  Your smile.  Your cheerfulness.  Your ability to 
do what it takes to defeat any obstacle... I could never be the 
cardcaptor.  I&#39;m not strong enough.  But YOU are, Sakura-chan... I am
in awe of your beauty and strength.&quot;

Another long series of blushes from Sakura, but she endured it only to 
press her lips to Tomoyo&#39;s suddenly as she finished, giving her a long, 
loving kiss... slowly they parted, Sakura&#39;s eyes drifting open.  &quot;... I 
love you, Tomoyo-chan.  You give me that strength... you always help me 
in times of need... and... sometimes, when I&#39;m not smart enough to 
solve a problem, you give me inspiration.  And... with all of those 
clothes... you make me feel beautiful.  I never felt that before you, 
Tomoyo-chan...&quot;

Tomoyo merely smiled, then nuzzled her face against Sakura&#39;s.  &quot;... I 
know this has to end someday.  But someday is a long time away from 
now... and now, I am in love, and my lover is in my arms.  Let the 
grown-ups call us stupid or sick... if this is sickness...&quot;

&quot;... Then I NEVER want to be well...&quot; 

The two giggled softly, exchanging another soft kiss.  Changing the 
subject, Sakura blushed a bit.  &quot;Tomoyo-chan... I always wondered how
you learned about making a girl feel good... &#39;down there&#39;...&quot;

Tomoyo winked.  &quot;Family secret.&quot;

Her lover blinked, sweatdropping faintly.  &quot;Eh?&quot;

&quot;Never you mind, dear... just lie with me...&quot;

And so she did... the two young girls pressed their bodies together, 
the warm light of the summer sun filtering through the blinds of 
Sakura&#39;s room and onto their nude bodies... to the outside, a pair of
girls engaged in an illicit act of perversion... but on the inside, two
people very much in love engaging in an experiment that, while
temporary, will give them fuel to love for the rest of their lives.</pre>
