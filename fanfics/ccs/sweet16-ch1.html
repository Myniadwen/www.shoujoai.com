------------------------------------------------------------

It was the first day after summer break.

In the Realm of Dreams that meant it was August 26th.

For Sakura it meant something else, only one week to go before 
Tomoyo&#146;s birthday.

So, for the first time ever, Sakura was up before Tomoyo. Up at 3AM in 
the morning.

But she wasn&#146;t up by choice. With a muffled yelp she jumps into a 
sitting position, drenched in a cold sweat. As her fingers rub her 
upper body, brushing away the sweat from her nude form, she grasps 
onto bits and pieces of her vision with abit of bitter regret.

In the vision they were in New King Penguin Park walking home, her and 
Tomoyo, when somebody grabbed her from behind. She felt a male hand 
clamped against her mouth as they were dragged into the area where 
King Penguin resided. While Tomoyo was dragged into the cavity beneath 
the huge slide, Sakura&#146;s attacker forced her to sit on his lap while 
he fondled her, forcing her to watch as Tomoyo&#146;s clothes was ripped 
away. Sakura tried to break free, to struggle, to scream, but more and 
more arms came out of nowhere to hold her tight. As Tomoyo&#146;s clothes 
vanished so did the clothes of her attackers. Sakura could hear her 
tormentor whispering into her ear, and it only made her want to cry. 
Tears blurred her vision as she watched the most precious thing in her 
life, legs spread, violated by--- it&#146;s then Sakura looks at her own 
captors to realize in shock it was Toya &amp; Yuki, both grinning 
sadistically as they undressed her and---

---at this point she wakes up screaming silently as if still gagged. 
She shivers on the bed, shaking as she holds herself. Pointless 
vision. She hated them. She wanted beautiful dreams and instead she 
saw things that could have happened, but it never happened. It was a 
mistake. She didn&#145;t mean to end up on that site, but the images were 
so compelling while disturbing at the same time. Girls, girls of only 
10-12 years old. Even images of herself and Tomoyo--- She had to think 
of something else, forget about her fears. Sakura couldn&#146;t decide on a 
special gift, so she decided to think about that.

. She already picked up a new prototype hybrid camcorder (first one 
using a combination DVD &amp; PC tech to record on) and some of Tomoyo&#146;s 
favorite collectibles. But she wanted something intimate for Tomoyo&#146;s 
birthday. Like the gift Tomoyo gave her. But she was so focused on her 
it brought out her worst fears while she only wanted to think about 
making Tomo-chan happy.

Sakura rolls over and looks at Tomoyo&#146;s sleeping form, remembering her 
gift on the day she turned 16. She had already given Sakura her 
favorite animes/mangas, and clothes she liked, a new set of roller 
blade and more yet there was still one more gift to give. As the two 
retired to her (soon to be their) bedroom Sakura was curious as to 
what the gift was. Tomoyo wouldn&#146;t say, and even went through an 
elaborate blindfold ritual to keep the gift a secret. Sakura had to 
wait a minute for the gift to be wrapped, which prompted her to ask if 
she could have her gift without wrapping paper. &#147;It&#146;s no fun unless 
you get to unwrap your gift!&#148; Tomoyo scolded her.

As long seconds passed Sakura grew restless, until finally Tomoyo 
called for her to come to the bed and unwrap her last gift. There, on 
the bed, Sakura&#146;s wandering hands (still blindfolded) found the 
ribbon, and the paper as she carefully (as carefully as her other 
gifts) unwrapped her present. As she reached in to feel it she felt a 
soft supple feel beneath her hands. The gift had gentle curves, 
roundness yet soft as well, and Tomoyo giggled every time she touched 
it in certain ways. Finally unable to contain her excitement Sakura 
ripped off her blindfold and came face to face with Tomoyo, naked, her 
maturing young woman&#146;s body before her. &#147;B-but-- Tomo-chan!&#148;

&#147;I know we promised we would wait until we&#146;re both sixteen. But I 
can&#146;t wait anymore.&#148; (she sits up and smiles) &#147;And I know you&#146;ll be 
gentle with me--- my love.&#148;

As the two kissed Sakura felt like crying. Tomoyo&#146;s beautiful finale 
gift started a whole new phase of their lives, as they moved from 
loving friends to intimate lovers overnight. But it wasn&#146;t a short 
thing that just happened. They had been friends for a long time, and 
in love for years. Reaching this point took a long road of twists, 
turns, and near disasters. However, in the end, they finally reached 
this point and it was beautiful. Still, Sakura occasionally lamented 
that she couldn&#146;t return the favor for Tomoyo. Sakura peels away the 
blankets to relish the view of Tomoyo&#146;s nude form, remembering how 
they made love a few hours ago before falling to sleep together, 
embraced. &#147;I wish I could awaken you like you did me on my birthday. 
Do something as beautiful and loving as the day we first made love.&#148; 
(a tear runs down Sakura&#146;s cheek) &#147;Your always the more mature of the 
two of us. I wish I had some of your maturity and wisdom. Then I could 
think of something special just for you on your sweet sixteen.&#148;

Suddenly Tomoyo&#146;s eyes fluttered, prompting Sakura to quickly cover 
her up and roll over pretending to be asleep. She took little breathes 
as she faked slumbering in a deep sleep.

&#147;Sakura-chan, I know your awake, you sleep in awkward positions when 
your in a deep sleep.&#148;

&#147;---is it that obvious?&#148; Sakura rolls over, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, Tomoyo. I---&#148; 
Tomoyo smiles, blankets pulled down abit to reveal her soft breasts. 
&#147;I felt you looking, maybe you&#146;d like your favorite &#147;pillows&#148; to fall 
asleep on.&#148; Tomoyo pulls Sakura towards her, lying her beloved&#146;s head 
on her maturing breasts as she did. &#147;Is something wrong, Sakura-chan?&#148;

Sakura thinks to herself, &#145;I can&#146;t tell her I&#146;m blanking on an 
intimate gift for her! I&#146;d feel stupid!&#146; Sakura thinks, then she 
thinks of her vision and admits to her darkest fears. &#147;Did you feel--- 
awkward if you surf the wrong site by accident? Did you ever see--- I 
mean link to--- I mean--- I meant I didn&#146;t want to stare and I&#146;m sorry 
but--- have you--- or have you thought of--- I mean---&#148;

&#147;Your talking about that site aren&#145;t you. The one with the adult fan 
mangas and pics of us and other girls? Is that it?&#148;

&#147;Yeah. I&#146;m sorry! I must have typed it wrong and I ended up there. I 
didn&#146;t mean to---&#147; (Sakura felt abit ashamed that she couldn&#146;t tell 
Tomoyo the truth, but that topic had been tormenting her too so it&#146;s 
not a complete lie--- just a half truth to hide a deeper truth). &#147;I 
couldn&#146;t help myself. Some of the pics were--- beautiful--- but 
th-they were horrible too. What they were--- the things they showed--- 
I mean, some were innocent, but others--- pain &amp; blood--- 
disturbing--- but I couldn&#146;t look away! I had to see more. I was 
curious and I couldn&#146;t stop myself for some reason! I don&#146;t know 
why--- Tomo-chan?&#147;

&#147;Yes?&#147;

&#147;Wh-when we first made love you were 15 &frac12; right? I thought you were 
the most beautiful woman in the world, and you keep growing more 
beautiful with age.&#148; (Tomoyo smiles as she picks up the conversation 
from there) &#147;You do realize we stop aging at 21, being fictionals and 
all.&#148;

&#147;I never understood that---&#148; (Sakura blushes, realizing she never 
thought of that before) &#147;---but what&#146;s the appeal. I mean, what&#146;s 
so--- I mean about us--- I--- why do they---&#148;

&#147;Why is there so much about us making love at 11? Why do they--- see 
us in that light?&#148;

Sakura nods her head sadly.

Tomoyo thinks back briefly to the incident Sakura is referring to.

Tomoyo runs her own Animation studio from the mansion. While the 
animation is done elsewhere, she does the editing there as well as 
make decisions and musical scores, box art, promotional, and so forth. 
Her favorite anime she releases is one based on Sakura herself, and 
her youthful adventures. But those adventures (in both the waking 
world and in the Realm of Dreams) inspire less than youthful (and more 
adult) images. One day she walked into her office to find Sakura 
there, breath staggered as she stares wide eyed at her computer screen 
(she gave Sakura a spot in her office to study and do homework). As 
Tomoyo nears she realizes Sakura was shaking visibly, her hand numbly 
paging clicking through rather disturbing images of herself (fan art) 
in many sexual poses, some more violent than others. What was worst, 
for Tomoyo at least, was the fact that they all were of Sakura at the 
tender innocent age of 10-11. Occasionally a picture of Tomoyo in a 
demeaning or sexually explicit scene would come up and Sakura would 
whimper as if hurt by each image, clicking quickly away to another 
picture. Sakura&#146;s mouth moved without words coming out, but Tomoyo 
could sense Sakura was silently crying for Tomo-chan, pleading for 
Tomoyo to stop her because she couldn&#146;t stop herself. With a sense of 
urgency, Tomoyo quickly covered Sakura&#146;s eyes feeling the girl sob as 
she did. &#147;Stop it, Sakura-chan. Stop. Please---&#148;

Her finger kept clicking, even without seeing she couldn&#145;t stop 
paging. &#147;---wh---wh---wh----&#148;

Tomoyo spins Sakura around, looking her straight in the eye. For a 
second Sakura&#146;s eyes go wide, her finger jabbing at an invisible 
button as if she&#146;s seeing something disturbing and she wanted it to 
change. Finally, as she realizes it was Tomoyo she was staring at, she 
drops into Tomoyo&#146;s arms crying.

She couldn&#146;t even manage to bring the words burning in her mind to 
light, she didn&#146;t know how to say what she felt, and that seemingly 
(then) was fine because Tomoyo didn&#146;t have answers for her. As Tomoyo 
looked up she saw an image that stuck in her mind. Herself &amp; Sakura, 
bound, gagged, lying humiliated on the ground after a rape scene. Legs 
spread provocatively and--- Tomoyo shuts her eyes and quickly turns 
the internet link off by instinct. She couldn&#146;t stare at the image 
anymore without shuddering.

But that was then, this is now.

&#147;It&#146;s a matter of taste, I suppose. Some might find an innocent beauty 
in our love so young.&#148;

&#147;But those files were awful! Those images and mangas were awful! We 
didn&#146;t do what those things accused us of doing!! Toya &amp; Yuki NEVER 
raped me! We never made love that young!! It&#145;s WRONG!!&#148;

&#147;I know, Sakura-chan, I know. We had an innocent kind of love that I 
see blossoming in Mirra-chan &amp; Hikaru. A special kind of love which 
doesn&#146;t need consummation to make it beautiful, and which makes 
consummation that much more special when the time is right.&#148;

&#147;B-but---&#148; Sakura stammered, looking for the right words, &#147;Kero said 
there&#146;s so little actual stories of us consummating willingly, so 
little innocent love--- there&#146;s so much rape, so much pain--- blood, 
violence, rape, humiliation--- why doesn&#146;t anyone see that as wrong?! 
Why do they see us like that? Toya, Yuki, our friends, so much pain. 
Doesn&#146;t anyone care about OUR feelings? Don&#146;t they care how we&#145;d feel? 
Don&#146;t they think we&#146;d be hurt by these images?? Why rape? Why not true 
love? What kind of love is rape? It&#145;s not love at all! I don&#145;t 
understand why!!&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan---&#147; (places her head on Sakura&#146;s and sighs, wondering how 
her precious love could always be so full of awkward yet insightful 
questions) &#147;You can&#146;t let drawings like that taint your perspectives. 
There&#146;s lots of good men out there like your brother Toya, Yuki, and 
more who would do right by us than let monsters like that harm women. 
And those mangas? Those stories extolling rape aren&#146;t suppose to 
cherish the loving union of two souls. They&#146;re adult entertainment, so 
they tend to--- go for the lowest common denominator and not care as 
much about the &#147;subjects&#148; of the story as they care about the bottom 
line. It&#146;s hard to build sympathy for fictionals I suppose when your 
catering to an audience that eats this kind of--- &#147;love&#147; up in globs. 
But there&#145;s far more beautiful stories of both the regular and sexual 
nature of us to hold onto and cherish in this world than worrying 
about those few sick stories that doesn&#145;t reflect the truth about our 
love.&#148; Tomoyo admits sadly, holding Sakura abit tighter. &#147;But I know 
I&#146;d never forgive myself if you were hurt in anyway, Sakura-chan. 
Sometimes I have night visions too--- bad ones--- about men--- 
violating you, and I was powerless to stop them.&#148;

&#147;Were you being--- violated too?&#148;

&#147;I don&#145;t know. I&#145;m too focused on you to notice. But that didn&#146;t 
matter to me. All I could think of was your pain. It hurt me watching 
them cause you pain. All I can think about is wanting desperately to 
rush to you, hold you tight, and take their--- abuse--- and protect 
you from them. If you were ever--- raped--- I could never forgive 
them. Never forgive myself---&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan--- but what about image of you? I don&#145;t want you---&#148;

&#147;Hush.&#148; Tomoyo kisses Sakura deeply, relishing their kiss before 
releasing her. &#147;I don&#146;t want you to worry about those nasty things 
anymore. And your dodging the real reason your up.&#148;

&#147;Phwee?&#148;

&#147;I saw the Victoria&#146;s Secrets catalog in your desk, and the intimate 
store flyers. Your thinking of making your own intimate gift 
presentation, right? For my birthday?&#148;

&#147;----so embarrassing--- I don&#146;t know what to get. I want it to be as 
special as your gift to me, but I don&#145;t know what to do--- money&#145;s no 
problem, but I want it to be special.&#148;

&#147;Let your heart pick it. It&#146;ll be beautiful when it&#146;s picked by a 
loving heart.&#148;

&#147;I want it to be special AND beautiful.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll do fine.&#148; Tomoyo pulls Sakura close and covers the two of them 
up again, &#147;Let&#146;s try to get a little more sleep. Good night, 
Sakura-chan.&#148;

&#147;Good night, Tomo-chan---&#148; (sighs) &#145;What do I get for Tomoyo?&#146;

As Sakura fell asleep it was now Tomoyo&#146;s turn to be up. She held 
Sakura tight, thinking briefly to the moment she woke up. Her night 
vision. They were as she told them to Sakura, except for one thing. In 
her dreams she does get to Sakura first, and holding Sakura tightly 
she blocks their attackers access to her and presents herself to them 
for violating. While she takes them all, Sakura cries beneath her, 
begging to shield Tomoyo, to take turns, to do something to spare her.

&#147;I can&#146;t tell you my fears. You&#146;d want to be my knight in shining 
armor, protect me from my fears, from my--- but I can&#146;t let you do 
that.&#148; Tomoyo softly whispers, &#147;Not like that. I won&#145;t let it happen. 
Not to you. I can&#145;t stand it when your in so much pain, beloved, so 
much pain--- I can&#145;t take it. I can&#145;t.&#148;

Tomoyo kisses the top of Sakura&#146;s head, feeling herself falling back 
to sleep.

------------------------------------------------------------

The next day, the first day of school came and went with a surprise at 
the end.

But reading Remastered II Episode 1 will clear that up for you (as to 
what happened).

Here however, Sakura is still lamenting over her perfect gift to 
Tomoyo. She managed to get into town on a pretense that she had 
business (though Tomoyo smiled as she parted from Sakura, as if she 
already knew what was on Sakura&#146;s mind). Sakura takes out the cell 
phone Tomoyo gave her once and makes a call. &#147;Maybe Nina has an idea.&#148; 
As the phone picks up she hears muffled moans and sharp cries.

&#147;Uh--- Nina?&#148;

The voice on the other end, however, wasn&#146;t Nina&#146;s. It was Eliza. 
&#147;Gasp--- gasp--- pant--- Nina&#146;s--- urgg--- busy! Her 
mouth----ooohhh--- and her hands are---- Nggh---&#148; Silence as Sakura 
face faults. &#147;Oh goddess, sweetness, moooooreee! Let me taste! Let me 
taste!&#148; (something muffled) &#147;The phone? I--- oh!&#148; (several beeps, 
moans, hisses and a &#147;Goddess your SO wet!&#148; later the phone disconnects 
leaving Sakura standing shell shocked on the sidewalk).

&#147;Need some help?&#148;

As Sakura turned about she came face to face with Michi Asagiri, 
Nina&#146;s friend (they met during something Nina&#146;s called &#147;Fictional 
Reviews&#148; down in the holochamber beneath the house). &#147;What&#146;s up?&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;I was in town briefly because Rahne&#146;s &#147;birthday&#148; (creation day) is 
coming up and I wanted to get her something special that I can&#146;t get 
for her in lockdown in Kona-Sector, so I took a brief trip out of 
State to do some shopping. Wanna come along with me and maybe pick up 
something for your Tomoyo?&#148;

&#147;Sure. Is it an intimate shop your going to? I was thinking of 
something along those lines---&#148;

Michi smirked, &#147;Intimate? We Winterians live for intimacy, and all the 
fun stuff before, during AND after that. Come on.&#148;

&#147;Oh. Uh--- Michi?&#148;

&#147;Yes?&#148;

&#147;Is it--- intimate--- to find young girls--- I mean to find a girl of 
a younger age sexually--- I---&#148;

&#147;Oh. That. The underaged thing, right?&#148;

&#147;Uh-huh.&#148;

Michi stops for a second, leans against a building and gives it 
serious thought. &#147;Personally I&#146;m not into the underaged thing myself. 
I like my women a nice settled age. Where they&#146;ve had a chance to 
grow, get some height (problem with underaged is they&#146;re all so damned 
short) and pretty much fill out in all the right places.&#148; (sighs) &#147;I 
don&#146;t see the appeal in it. It&#146;s nothing I would get turned on by.&#148; 
(smiles) &#147;Though TECHNICALLY Rahne is only a year and a half. Being an 
artificially created Sexaroid (human/cyberroid hybrid born in a 
cloning facility that mass produces sex girls), so I guess I do have a 
sweet spot for one &#147;little girl&#148;.&#148; (giggles abit)

&#147;Huh?&#148; (confused)

&#147;----&#148; (waves Sakura off) &#147;Never mind. Let&#146;s go help you with that 
gift now.&#148;

The shop Michi takes Sakura to was hidden in a bustling alley Sakura 
never saw before.

Below, on street level was people passing by and shops. One level 
above was a crystal clear path for small transports and other 
conveyances (of both the mechanical and animal type) which lead to 
parking areas strung along the second floors of the buildings.

&#147;It&#146;s like that scene out of Harry Potter &amp; The Philosopher&#146;s Stone, 
only with more stuff.&#148; Sakura whispered in admiration as she looked 
about at the stores in the alley. &#147;What?&#148; (Michi) &#147;You mean the Dragon 
Alley scene? Yeah. I remember that movie. We inaugurated it last 
February. But this is the very rare culturally sensitive shops that 
cater to specific off planet species. There&#146;s several restaurants 
alone here that cater to alien tastes, not to mention shops that 
specifically sell products only available on other worlds. And if 
that&#146;s not enough there&#146;s even a dealership/stable here that deals in 
rare off world transportation alternatives--- like that!&#148; Sakura 
nearly falls over as she watches a huge thing that looked like a 
kitten walk by on the clear upper traffic level. &#147;That&#146;s a Cantripa. A 
Nekochanian version of a VW. Those are artificially created and have 
the intelligence of a horse. They&#146;re very loyal and quite protective 
of owners who treat them kindly and with love, even to the point of 
sacrificing their own lives for their loving owners. I wouldn&#146;t 
recommend them for Tokyo though (heavy traffic scares them), but the 
people who use them here have shuttles at the end of the market areas 
which they use to transport their Cantripas in and out so they don&#146;t 
expose them to too much stress.&#148;

&#147;Why bring them here if they can&#146;t go outside this shopping area?&#148;

&#147;Some owners dreadfully love their cantripas to death, have to take 
them everywhere. And it&#146;s also recommended to take them out and ride 
them every so often so they get their exercise. It&#146;s for their health 
as well as for the convenience that they should be ridden every so 
often.&#148;

Michi pulls Sakura aside and into a quaint shop with tinted window 
calls &#147;Blue Dust Intimacies&#148;.

&#147;Hey there! Me and my friend here are looking for something.&#148;

The shopkeeper looks at Sakura with a stern expression, &#147;Michi, you 
can&#146;t keep bringing your hard up human friends in here. It makes me 
wonder if your blood isn&#145;t turning red.&#148;

&#147;The stuff in here is good for humans and Winterians, don&#146;t give me 
that spiel that it isn&#146;t.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s SPECIAL stuff from homeworld! You honestly don&#146;t give two damns 
about your heritage, don&#146;t you. Honestly. Still, can she handle it?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s for my---&#148;

&#147;You sleeping with her?&#148;

&#147;Y-yes---&#148;

&#147;Then your using it too. She can handle it? I need to see her in 
action before I give her the goods.&#148;

Michi looks at the shopkeeper if she just grew a new head, &#147;How do you 
want her to verify that? Why don&#146;t she just masturbate her parts right 
now and let you see if she&#146;s working properly. HELL, I&#146;ll even Trib 
her right here in the shop just so you see her working parts in 
operation. How about it?&#148;

&#147;Well if you think she can take it, I---ghhk!!&#148; (Michi grabs the 
shopkeeper&#146;s throat and squeezes) &#147;You ever hint for me to fuck my 
friends again and I&#146;ll break your neck! You got it?&#148;

&#147;Y-y-yes!!&#148; (Michi lets go) &#147;Fuck! You&#146;re a tightly wound bitch.&#148;

&#147;And you&#146;re a fucked up racist. Hate it when the real owner&#146;s on 
vacation. Now are---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll help, I&#146;ll help. Guess you want your usual gift of affection. 
First time for her, right?&#148;

&#147;Rahne&#146;s a big girl, she can handle it.&#148;

&#147;I mean the little girl over there. She&#146;s, what, all of 12 or 14?&#148;

&#147;16. I&#146;m 16 actually.&#148; (looks depressed) &#147;Do I really look that young? 
Is that how everyone---&#148;

The shopkeeper frowns at her, &#147;Sorry. Didn&#146;t mean--- sigh. Hate those 
sites. Damn pervs.&#147; (looks Michi dead in the eyes) &#147;You do know she&#146;s 
really going to be blasted by the stuff you use, right? So I&#146;m going 
to give her the lighter dose oils, send her to heaven without it being 
a one-way trip. Her lover too.&#148;

&#147;No prob. Think she&#146;ll like it.&#148;

Sakura was puzzled, &#147;Shouldn&#146;t I browse the dildoes and strap ons? 
Maybe a vibrator or a---&#148;

The shopkeeper (from behind) laughed, &#147;What an obvious choice! Go for 
the &#147;road&#148; less traveled if you want to make her experience a special 
one--- and here we go.&#148; (brings two large hi-tech clear crystal steel 
bottles with a pump extractor (for exact measurements of the oil so 
that none is wasted), inside holding a deep blue liquid). &#147;This is 
Blue Dragon Essence. NOT made from real blue dragon or anything but 
it&#146;s a Winterian legend thing. Here, this potent one&#146;s yours and this 
lighter one is for the girl.&#148;

&#147;Blue Dragon? And why not the potent one?&#148;

Michi smiles as she taps Sakura on the shoulder, &#147;Trust me, it&#146;s 
REALLY potent. You two will be far happier with that one. It&#146;ll stim 
you without frying your brain. I&#146;m more jaded and Rahne&#146;s--- well, 
she&#146;s special, so a more potent dose is needed for us.&#148;

&#147;Do we drink it?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a body oil. Follow the instructions on the bottle and mix it 
with bath water. For best results run the bath through it&#146;s 
drain/recycle phase and do it while it&#146;s recycling. As for the legend? 
Well---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a Winterian legend.&#148; The shopkeeper notes, &#147;A few hundred years 
ago a village girl fell in love with a blue wing blade&#145;s humanoid 
form--- Wing Blades are Winterian versions of Dragons by the way--- 
and they (the wing blade in human form + herself) would be together 
every day. They went to the stores together, picnicked at the park, 
saw movies together, did friend things together. There were even 
rumors of the two having sex together but the story states that they 
were traditionalist and didn&#146;t want to do it unless they were joined 
in matrimony. Well, one day the human girl proposed to the wing blade 
and it made her the happiest wing blade in the valley--- until a 
greedy rich bastard tried to steal her future bride from her. She 
raided the flying fortress he lived in with the help of another blue 
wing blade (her mentor) and the two freed the younger wing blade&#146;s 
mate. They learned then that she had been whipped by guards for 
refusing to have sex with the bastard because she was true to her love 
and wouldn&#146;t allow another to soil her virginity. The younger dragon 
stood with her love, healing her broken body and soul, while the older 
one inflicted vengeance on the bastard.&#148;

Michi takes over, &#147;When they escaped the doomed fortress the three 
went to a secret valley of wing blades and human lovers and married. 
There, on their wedding night, the older dragon presented them with a 
special gift, the first dose of Essence given to a wing blade / 
Winterian coupling. After that the two decided to bottle the stuff and 
make sure every young couple in love can share in the pure bliss and 
passion that comes from two souls in love. Very beautiful story, it 
was one my favorites when I was a little girl.&#148;

&#147;Yeah. Saw that hentai site though? The one---&#148;

&#147;I know. I know. Fucking blasphemy if you ask me.&#148;

&#147;Wh-what?&#148;

Both women look at Sakura. &#147;Oh, right.&#148; (shopkeeper) &#147;It&#146;s a site 
filled with underaged images of characters from these stories. Mostly 
in sex or bondage or rape scenes. Blasphemy. All our records show the 
girls of these stories were at least 14-17 cycles old when these 
stories took place, but that didn&#146;t stop these sites from going for 
the throat and making them little 10-12 cycles old! What a bunch of 
knobs!&#148;

&#147;So you don&#146;t--- approve of that---&#148;

The shopkeeper looks at Michi questionably. &#147;What?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s curious about how you feel about underaged eroticism.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; (looks at Sakura) &#147;Don&#146;t believe in it. Girls that age should be 
having fun (fun fun, and not sex fun) and enjoying childhood 
innocence, and childhood love. Not worrying about being older too fast 
and consummating before it&#146;s time. They&#146;ll have plenty of time for sex 
later, but when they&#146;re that age they should concern themselves with 
gentle hugs and friendships that slowly blossom to love but not rush 
it. It&#146;s far more beautiful to let your youthful love blossom slowly 
into mature romance then sexual passion, and not rush the noise and 
make it fast. I wish I could experience my youthful innocent love days 
again--- sigh--- brings nothing but fond memories from me whenever I 
think about it.&#148; (sighs)

&#147;Do you--- I mean, and is it dragon&#146;s blood? What kind of essence? 
What&#145;s essence?&#148;

(the shopkeeper however is still in her flashback memory mode and not 
listening) &#147;I&#146;m not into the young stuff. I have a little sister. I 
couldn&#146;t stare at her and get hot like that, let alone pictures like 
that. It&#146;s awkward. Give me a 15-20 year old girl anyday! (16&#146;s better 
though).&#148;

&#147;What is essence?&#148;

Both women suddenly blush as they realize they&#145;re being talked to, and 
what the topic of that talk is. Michi quickly picks up the dropped 
&#147;ball&#147; and runs with it. &#147;It&#146;s--- well it&#146;s essence! The older dragon 
was a skilled bath oil maker and she made the first batches of the 
stuff that sold. She was very proficient in her work. That&#145;s how the 
legend goes.&#148;

&#147;Probably a very horny dragon too---ouch!&#148;

&#147;Do you mind?!&#148;

&#147;What did she say?&#148; Sakura asked.

&#147;Nothing. Nothing.&#148; (Michi takes the lighter blue liquid and shoves it 
back into the shopkeeper&#146;s hands). &#147;Here, less talk more action. Wrap 
this so she can go, and help her pick out something &#147;clich&eacute;&#148; while 
she&#146;s at it. You know---&#148; (pushes Sakura towards the shopkeeper) 
&#147;Strap on, dildoes, etc.&#148;

&#147;Fine. Fine.&#148; (looks at Sakura) &#147;Does she want to browse the little 
women or the big women&#146;s toy section?&#148; (looks her over) &#147;Maybe the 
little women&#146;s section.&#148;

&#147;Hmph.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;I&#146;m home!&#148; Sakura yelled as she quickly ran into the bedroom, gift 
under her arm. After a few frantic seconds of searching, she stashes 
it into a spot in the huge walk in closet. She had left the bedroom 
door open as she ran in so she could hear the people outside the room. 
&#147;Sakura? Where are you?&#148;

&#147;In the bedroom, Tomoyo! I&#146;ll meet you in the upstairs kitchen!&#148;

&#147;Alright. I&#146;m already making dinner! Come on, it&#146;s almost time to eat!

Once she was certain the gift was properly hidden out of sight she 
went back out and into her private &#147;lab&#148; a few doors down from the 
bedroom. There, waiting for her, was Tomoyo who was already cooking 
dinner for them. &#147;Mother&#146;s going to eat out because she&#146;s working late 
so everyone else went into town for dinner. It&#146;s just us tonight, is 
that OK?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s fine. You want any help with that?&#148;

&#147;No, thanks, I have everything under control.&#148; (smiles) &#147;So, how was 
your shopping trip?&#148;

&#147;Bida!&#148; (sticks tongue out at Tomoyo) &#147;I won&#146;t tell! You have to see 
it yourself!&#148;

&#147;Ok! Ok! I relent to your secrecy. I guess we&#146;ll have to see it when I 
open the gift on my birthday.&#148;

&#147;Ummm---&#148; (Sakura fidgets in her chair) &#147;Can we have the party at my 
old home? It&#146;s private and we can have a party just for the two of us, 
and--- well and---&#148;

&#147;And we can party naked and I can scream my head off while breaking in 
my new &#147;toys&#148; and nobody&#146;ll notice? I like your thinking.&#148; (smiles as 
she motions for Sakura to lay out the plates for them which she busies 
herself with as Tomoyo checks the food again) &#147;Is it going to be that 
strong a trip? You were desperately trying to keep from screaming the 
first time we made love. It looked so cute how you kept trying to 
muffle your approvals of my lovemaking until finally you spent most of 
our first time giving me pleasure just to silence yourself.&#148; (smiles) 
&#147;It was better when you thought of that getaway once a week to your 
house where you can be you and not worry about what other people 
think--- or hear. The first time we did it there was heaven. I never 
realized how beautiful your voice is until you were making all that 
noise!&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan!&#147; (Sakura blushes slightly) &#147;That&#146;s why I want to do it 
there. So you don&#146;t have to feel--- inhibited--- and was I that good? 
I didn&#145;t notice.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re the best, Sakura-chan! Well, you&#146;ll definitely beat me on the 
originality of the presentation for one thing! I wish I thought of it 
when I presented my loving gift to you---&#148; (kisses Sakura&#146;s cheek as 
the lays out dinner for them) &#147;The rest will be just as beautiful when 
I open my special gift!&#148;

&#147;I hope---&#148; (blushes) &#147;Uh--- Tomoyo?&#148;

&#147;Yes?&#148;

&#147;Does it feel awkward when you--- I mean have you ever felt like---&#148;

&#147;Seeing pictures of myself on those sites?&#148;

Sakura nods her head.

For the longest time Tomoyo ponders how to answer, &#147;To be honest I&#146;ve 
looked occasionally. But more to see how they represent you than me. 
Occasionally I&#146;d see a picture of us together, but rarely am I ever 
pleased with what I see. Once in a while there&#146;s a picture that is 
loving without violence or rape, I have them on file (I&#146;ll show them 
to you.)&#148;

&#147;Nice pictures?&#148;

&#147;Not all pictures of us (or other girls) are bad. Some are truly 
beautiful, and intimate without being exploitive, or mean spirited. 
Some are in fact quite beautiful, and brings a tear to my eye. 
Here---&#148; (hands a picture she copied off to Sakura as she smiles) 
&#147;See? Not every picture is horrible. Some of them are beautiful and 
intimate drawings of us. No rape, violence or blood, just something 
special and it&#146;s quite beautiful don&#145;t you think?&#148;

&#147;It is.&#148; Sakura smiles, admiring the picture &#147;But it&#146;s rare though, 
isn&#146;t it?&#147;

&#147;But they&#146;re there all the same.&#148; Tomoyo assures her, &#147;You just have 
to ignore the bad stuff to find the good things out there. Look hard 
enough and you&#146;ll find the beauty even in a patch of bad pictures.&#147;

Tomoyo leans over, kissing Sakura on the forehead as she finishes 
dinner. &#147;The good pics inspire me sometimes when we make love. They&#145;re 
little diamonds of knowledge that give me inspiration in bed.&#148;

&#147;----&#148; (blushes)

&#147;Now come on. Let&#146;s eat then I&#146;ll show you my favorites. Maybe they&#146;ll 
inspire you too.&#148; (winks)

&#147;----&#148; (blushes a deeper shade of red)

------------------------------------------------------------

As the week passed things kept at a maniac pace in the Clow capturing 
dept. But that was then, this is now. The two were going to celebrate 
at Sakura&#146;s old home, sharing this special moment just between the two 
of them. The previous weekend they had the large party for Tomoyo with 
family &amp; friends, this party was just for her and Sakura. The presents 
she got for this day were already inside, all she had to do was get 
them inside. Sakura&#146;s heart is pounding fiercely. Her hands sweaty as 
she tried to find the key for the door.

Tomoyo&#146;s arms looped around her waist, her head rested on her shoulder 
as they drew close to keep warm from the shivering rain that pelted 
them. Sakura didn&#146;t need to glance at Tomoyo to know her present 
state. Her eyes are filled with want and desire, her breath short as 
she tries to smother her feelings. But she wanted this as badly as 
Sakura, and she couldn&#146;t hide her excitement.

Sakura tried another key and failed, looking for the right key as her 
hands trembled. The outfit beneath her coat was turning her on, and 
making her horny. Sakura wanted to scream in frustration for not 
marking the key somehow but Tomoyo would only urge her to look for the 
key. She knew it was one of these keys because she opened the door 
last week for them to stay the night, but Tomoyo was a real trooper 
and took the wait in stride. Click. Finally it unlocked!

Barely managing to get through the door, they stumbled into what used 
to be Sakura&#146;s home before her father disappeared, and she moved in 
with Tomoyo. Nobody lived there in awhile, and it seemed a safe place 
to have a day alone which is what the two did every week (on the day 
Mirra-chan spent an overnighter at her friend Hikaru&#145;s house). 
Everything seemed the same, as if kept in state until her father came 
home to bring life back into it&#146;s halls. And in a sense that&#146;s exactly 
how the house was kept.

With shaky hands Sakura manages to lock the door and seal the two 
inside, wobbling into the living area before she collapses onto the 
couch. Tomoyo was right behind her, her hands were everywhere, 
removing the overcoat, prodding her lover&#146;s breasts, stroking her 
legs, feeling her private spot. The mere thought of making love in the 
living room was driving her wild and she didn&#146;t know what to sample 
first. Sakura flips herself upwards and tugs away at Tomoyo&#146;s clothes, 
revealing her body as Tomoyo reveals Sakura&#146;s sexy bunny outfit in 
turn. Tears flowed down her face as she felt herself being 
masturbated, and couldn&#146;t do a thing to stop it. She remembered the 
first time Tomoyo gave her the costume in that very house. How she 
filmed Sakura on her old bed masturbating for Tomoyo&#146;s eyes only, 
gripped in her own pleasure as she watched Tomoyo watching with 
fluttering heart and shaky hands. Tomoyo enjoyed filming Sakura, and 
sometimes Sakura enjoyed making Tomoyo&#146;s private films that much more 
enjoyable when she starred in her own private performance for Tomoyo&#146;s 
eyes only. Weakly Sakura&#146;s voice asks for Tomoyo and something only 
Tomoyo could give her, and she provides by turning herself about to 
give Sakura access to her own sex while she makes love to Sakura&#146;s 
sweet spot.

Making love in what would have been the most public room of the house 
heightened their act. Making it stronger and more exciting as they did 
it on what could have been open view of anyone in the house. After 
several long tantalizing minutes both girls cried out as she came in 
turn, splattering her juices over the hands and mouths of her lover. 
Both women collapsing into the couch gasping for breath.

Tomoyo cooed quietly as she laid her head against Sakura&#145;s spot. She 
loved her private moments away from home with Sakura. As much as they 
made love at home, making love in the privacy of Sakura&#145;s old house 
was her favorite because they could do it anywhere and nobody would 
know.

Sakura gripped Tomoyo&#146;s rear, relishing in the touch of her lover&#146;s 
spot on her face as she gasped. Seconds later they&#146;d switch position 
and lie face to face, kissing as they caught their breath.

&#147;Tomoyo---&#148; Sakura gasped as she breathed heavily, her strength slowly 
returning, &#147;---I wish we could marry--- and make this our home--- 
that&#145;d be the best birthday gift ever---&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan?&#148;

&#147;Live here as mates. Make a life here as two hearts joined in 
matrimony. Be more than just lovers.&#148;

Tomoyo rises to Sakura&#146;s level and holds her tight, &#147;I&#146;m happy 
regardless of that. Just being with you, loving you, that&#146;s all that 
matters to me---&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan.&#148; Sakura sighs happily.

&#147;We can always go Winterian anyway if we wanted!&#148;

&#147;---&#148; (feels the urge to fall off the couch)

&#147;We&#146;ll need Last Night attendants. I figure I&#146;ll ask my bodyguards to 
attend me while Windy, Umi, Gaia, Light &amp; Dark attend you. Then we&#146;ll 
have the ceremony and ask the Priestess to bless our first lovemaking 
as a married couple and---&#148;

&#147;There&#146;s a lot of group sex in Winterian marriage ceremonies! I&#146;m not 
comfortable with that!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not as bad as it sounds. It&#145;s only one group sex thing (Last 
Night which is the Winterian version of a bachelor party)---&#148; (hugs 
Sakura) &#147;But regardless of whether we marry or not, we&#146;re married in 
my heart and that what truly counts to me. Nobody can take that away 
from us. Nobody.&#148;

&#147;---Tomo-chan---&#148; (Sakura smiles again)

&#147;Wanna see how the camera set-ups are because I could change them 
and---&#148; (Sakura sweat drops) &#147;We talked about it last week and you 
were all for it so I borrowed your key and set up cameras so we can 
film my birthday lovemaking and---&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan!&#148; (Sakura blushes at the thought of all her orgasms being 
saved on DVD for posterity. It made Tomoyo happy to film their 
intimacy, but Sakura wasn&#145;t so sure about it.)

------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing Tomoyo wanted to do that day was their weekly 
tradition to do everything without clothes, or as little clothes as 
possible. So while she stocked the fridge with their supplies for the 
night, Sakura put on her one piece of clothes Tomoyo let her wear (an 
apron for cooking with). The apron covered her from shoulder blades to 
barely bottom with her legs exposed. Her whole backside of course was 
exposed, and Tomoyo sometimes got a kick out of sneaking up on Sakura 
and sticking her hands under the garment to massage Sakura&#146;s breasts.

On the apron were the words &#147;The World&#146;s Greatest Cook&#148;. &#147;Not likely.&#148; 
Sakura sighed, still not confident with her cooking skills after all 
the time she worked at making her cooking better and better. Still she 
felt she wasn&#146;t as good as she could have been, and she felt if wanted 
to live alone with Tomoyo and Mirra-chan she had to learn how to cook 
better. Still, with Kero being such a critic sometimes she became a 
little gunshy in the kitchen when it came to cooking new things.

Once she tried to make one of Tomoyo&#146;s favorite (yet simple) dishes, 
spaghetti, and Kero tasted it first without her permission. &#147;Eck! Your 
not going to serve that to her are you? It&#146;s horrid---&#148; (Sakura threw 
the food away and spent the next hour crying in their bedroom. 
Eventually Tomoyo found her, scooped her up into her gentle arms and 
rocked Sakura&#146;s tears away. Tomoyo cooked dinner that night, but 
Sakura still felt bad that she couldn&#145;t master a simple thing like 
spaghetti. Tomoyo presented her with the apron the next day and told 
her to not give up on her cooking experiments, and even spent time 
teaching Sakura how to make spaghetti just right.)

&#147;Tomo-chan---&#148; Sakura sighed, feeling the cloth of the apron. Tomoyo 
bought it for her to remind Sakura that she was her number one fan 
when it came to her cooking. &#147;---sometimes I think you tolerate my 
food just because you love me. I want to be better, but---&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll be better, trust me.&#148; Tomoyo&#146;s voice rings out from behind, 
her arms wrapping around Sakura&#146;s waist and holding her tight. &#147;Don&#146;t 
listen to Kero-chan. He&#146;s just picky at times. I love your cooking 
because it&#146;s filled with your love for me every time you cook 
something just for me to enjoy.&#148;

&#147;Tomo-chan.&#148; Sakura sighs, feeling Tomoyo&#146;s body against her back. She 
was obviously wearing nothing. Sakura looked down to notice the one 
thing Tomoyo wears on days like this, her socks. &#147;Aren&#146;t you a little 
cold in just that?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s my one piece of clothes, and I like socks.&#148; Tomoyo jokes, 
kissing Sakura&#146;s cheek as she backs away allowing Sakura a good look 
at her beautiful body. &#147;Want to have a snack before we go at it 
again?&#148;

&#147;Sure. Let&#146;s go, I bought crackers and cheese for snacking.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s my girl.&#148; Tomoyo smiles, luring Sakura towards the kitchen 
with a come hither look.

------------------------------------------------------------

After assembling their snack the two retire back to the couch where 
they just made love a few minutes ago. &#145;Just eating crackers with her 
is getting me aroused again---&#146; Sakura thinks to herself as she 
munches of her cheese/crackers to replenish her strength. Tomoyo, 
picking up on Sakura&#146;s aroused state, sometimes takes the slices of 
cheese and gives them long slow licks, as if showing Sakura what she 
had in store for her when they did it again.

Suddenly Sakura felt a slight twinge of regret, &#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;For what?&#148;

&#147;About those pictures.&#148; Sakura lamented, &#147;I&#146;m glad there&#146;s some 
pictures of us that&#146;s beautiful. But the others--- they&#145;re not fair. 
It&#145;s not fair to us. To you. It&#145;s just not--- I don&#145;t know why but---&#148;

&#147;No, it&#145;s not fair. Things like that gave birth to cards like the Fear 
&amp; Pervert Cards. But there&#146;s also beauty out there. Maybe it&#146;s best 
just to focus on the beauty and ignore the ugly things that make us 
shiver. It&#146;s the beautiful things that make life most worth living 
after all. Right?

&#147;Right.&#147; Sakura sighs, looking down at her feet as she munches another 
cracker, &#147;But you caught the Pervert card. I had to shiver in your 
arms while you helped me catch the Shadow &amp; Fear cards. I felt so--- 
helpless--- useless--- and so scared. It&#146;s not fair! Why can&#146;t I be 
your knight in shining armor?! I wanted to be brave for you--- your so 
much more mature than I am.&#148;

&#147;You saved me more times than I can count!&#148; Tomoyo rebutted, &#147;You&#146;ve 
always been my knight in shining armor. A few times I get to be the 
heroine doesn&#146;t make you a bad Card Captor, it just makes you human. 
And that&#146;s what we all are, fictional, dreamlings or normal when it 
comes down to it. We&#146;re just human, and sometimes humans fall on their 
rears and it&#146;s OK. You picked yourself up right after that and 
continued on, remember? You&#146;re the bravest girl I ever met, and I 
can&#146;t imagine wanting to be saved by anyone else but you. My precious 
Sakura-chan.&#148;

&#147;Oh Tomo-chan---&#148; Sakura blushes, &#147;Your too sweet.&#148;

&#147;Nice of you to notice. Now---&#148; (leans forward) &#147;I&#146;m done. And when 
your done we&#146;ll go find a new room to play in. How about your old 
bedroom?&#148;

&#147;No--- the bathroom.&#148; Sakura gulped, feeling her energy rise and her 
body respond to Tomoyo&#146;s thoughts. &#147;I have my special intimate gift to 
give you.&#148;

&#147;In the bathroom?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll see--- when we take a bath.&#148;

&#147;Ohhhh----&#148; (smiles) &#147;I see. Well in that case I don&#146;t mind getting 
wet if you don&#146;t.&#148;

Sakura swallows hard and feels Tomoyo&#146;s warmth as she draws near, 
pulling Sakura along as they get up (plates into the sink) and head to 
the upstairs bathroom.

------------------------------------------------------------

The water was ready. She had already ran it through the drain/recycle 
mode while Tomoyo busied herself with preparing their snack. The water 
seemed a light tinge of purple as the two approached the tub. &#147;You 
used a bath oil, right? It looks funky the water. Is that my gift?&#148;

&#147;Partially. Get in and we&#146;ll take a bath.&#148;

&#147;Alright.&#148; Tomoyo agreed, slipping her socks off as she watched Sakura 
disrobe.

Slowly Tomoyo slid into the water, feeling it embrace her warmly 
soaking into her skin as she laid down. &#147;Ooohhh---- it&#146;s so pleasant! 
It&#146;s like the water&#146;s warming me from the inside out! Sigh.&#148;

Sakura slowly slides in, sitting opposite of Tomoyo letting the water 
soak in. &#147;It is good.&#148;

After a few blissful minutes of soaking the bath water in, Tomoyo 
smiles as she looks at Sakura, &#147;Tell me honestly. Did you ever--- I 
mean, when we were living together for that year before we 
consummated--- did you ever want to make love?&#148;

&#147;Occasionally. I felt bad though. I thought you would be angry at me, 
or throw me out if you thought I was a pervert. I felt ashamed.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be. I had long thoughts about it when we were together before 
consummating.&#148;

&#147;R-really?&#148;

&#147;But I thought I&#146;d scare you away if I did it before you were ready.&#148; 
(laughs) &#147;Shows what those guys who made those pictures and mangas of 
us knew! You would have ran away if I even tried to do half the stuff 
they say I did to you! You weren&#146;t ready for that kind of love when 
you were that age!&#148;

&#147;I am now.&#148;

&#147;You are now.&#148; Tomoyo agrees, leaning forward smiling. &#147;Ready for some 
now?&#148;

Sakura gulps nervously as she fidgets abit, moving forward slowly 
towards Tomoyo reaching out towards her, shivering slightly despite 
the body warming effect of the water in the tub. As they touched 
however, both felt a strong surge and separated quickly. &#147;Gasp!&#148; 
Tomoyo leaned back, feeling it go through her like wildfire. &#147;What was 
that??&#148;

&#147;This stuff is supposed to enhance lovemaking--- woog--- glad I didn&#146;t 
take the stronger stuff.&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s try again.&#148; Tomoyo urged, motioning for Sakura to grab her as 
she pulled out a bath pillow (a huge floating air pillow that attaches 
to one side of the tub, a gift from Nina) and hooks it up. Gingerly 
Sakura reaches out, hands shaking as she does, only to be pulled 
quickly in by Tomoyo. As their bodies meet both girls scream out, 
&#147;GODDESS THIS IS INTENSE!!&#148;

&#147;Wh-WHAT&#146;S HAPPENING?!?&#148; Sakura yelped, feeling overwhelmed by just 
being in contact with Tomoyo&#146;s body. The liquid in the bath soaked 
each of their bodies with it&#146;s effect, and just touching now had a 
strong overwhelming power on them. Sakura lashes her arms out to grab 
the tub siding behind Tomoyo&#145;s head, slowly rubbing herself against 
Tomoyo&#146;s body making the sensations spark and burn brighter. &#147;Ugh--- 
goddess--- it&#146;s getting stronger!! Oh goddess---&#148;

Tomoyo grabs the sides of the tub and rubs herself upwards to meet 
Sakura&#146;s strokes strongly melding her body to Sakura&#146;s. &#147;Goddess! 
Sakura-chan! Oh sweet Sakura--- it&#146;s----&#148; (Tomoyo&#146;s voice gives as she 
begins to moan, her mind losing all thought of speech and giving into 
her body&#146;s cries for release). Frantically they make love, strongly 
and fiercely, rubbing together their bodies and their souls, reaching 
for that moment just past their reach. Suddenly it felt as if 
everything was going numb as their bodies arched tightly together. 
With one final cry they release together, whimpering and crying as 
their bodies lets go of their pent up needs and releases in one 
satisfying wave of pleasure that smothers them both in it&#146;s grasp.

For long seconds both are unable to stop rocking and shaking, frantic 
movements rubbing together making the moment ripple longer and longer 
until--- Sakura&#146;s head snaps back as she whimpers loudly, coming again 
as Tomoyo also achieves a second orgasm so close to her first.

Long seconds pass as they ride the dual orgasm out, until it feels as 
if the world has dropped away from them leaving them senseless. 
Sakura&#146;s head slowly slips into the water until she feels Tomoyo&#146;s 
arms grab her tight, pulling her towards the dark haired young woman, 
keeping her head above water.

&#147;---sakura-chan---&#148;

&#147;---goddess--- tomo-chan---&#148;

Words failing them they laid there motionless, held tightly in each 
others arms afloat in the water. Their energy spent they simply allow 
the water to soak in, heating their bodies again until they were ready 
to do it again. &#147;Next time---&#148; Tomoyo rasps, &#147;Let&#146;s do it in bed.&#148;

&#147;---uh-huh---&#148;

&#147;I love you, my precious---&#148;

&#147;I love you--- Tomo-chan--- my wife---&#148;

Tomoyo smiles, holding Sakura close as she lets the words sink in. Her 
wife.

With that the two fall into a brief slumber, floating on water and 
feeling at peace.

One day they might marry. But for now they were married in their 
hearts if not in reality.

Nobody could tell them otherwise, and that in the end was what really 
counted.

Or so it goes.
