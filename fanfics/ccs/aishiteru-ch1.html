<pre>Sakura slowly walked into her classroom, quietly searching for her 
desk next to Tomoyo. 

&quot;Kinimoto!&quot; Mr. Terada said surprising Sakura as she sank in her chair 
blushing majorly. 

&quot;Hai, Terada~sensei&quot; she said shyly. 

&quot;Late again, hm?&quot; he said teasing her a bit as he looked back at his 
book. &quot;Well, back to our lesson&quot; he said smiling asuming Sakura knew 
what they were working on. 

&quot;I thought you`d be used to it by now&quot; she heard a voice behind her as 
she looked back at the corner of her eye. *Tomoyo~chan!* she thought 
as she smiled at her frend. 

&quot;Not just yet&quot; she said, still blushing as she saw Mr. Terada`s gaze 
lingering along the class finally being set on her. 

&quot;Kinimoto, how many times do I have to ask you? Please stop talking 
during my lesson!&quot; Sakura quickly got out her history book and looked 
up at the board not really interested in what he had to say, glancing 
back at Tomoyo occasionally. 

They heard the bell ring, 40 minutes were up, class was finally over. 
She looked back at Tomoyo and smiled reliefed it was done. Tomoyo 
returned the smile as she packed her History books in her bag and got 
up. 

Sakura did the same, and streched her arms out, and gave a little yawn 
&quot;I`m glad History is the last subject of the day.&quot; Sakura said smiling 
at Tomoyo as her other friends Chiharu, Noako, Rika, and Yamazaki came 
up behind her. 

&quot;Hey!&quot; the all said, also excited that they could go home and do 
nothing for the weekend. 

&quot;Hey&quot; Sakura said as Tomoyo just nodded. 

They started walking as usual, there first stop was at Chiharu`s, 
Yamazaki usually stayed with her until her mom got home. Then it was 
Noako, who wanted Rika to stay for a while. It was just Tomoyo and 
Sakura left walking alone. 

Sakura looked over at Tomoyo, blushing everytime she saw Tomoyo look 
back at her and smiled her little &#39;Tomoyo smile&#39; with her perfect red 
lips forming a smile, and her beautiful blue eyes close slightly, 
which makes her head tilt. *She`s so....* Sakura thought to herself 
not sure why she was thinking this way, but she didn`t really care as 
Tomoyo took her hand gently and gave her another &#39;Tomoyo smile&#39;. 

&quot;Is there something wrong, Sakura~chan? You can tell me anything, you 
know that, right?&quot; Tomoyo said concered about Sakura`s distant look. 

&quot;I`m fine, Tomoyo~chan!&quot; Sakura said cheerfully smiling back smiling 
back as they finally reached Sakura`s house. 

&quot;Can I come in?&quot; Tomoyo asked not so sure about what kind of answer 
she would get. 

&quot;Of course!&quot; Sakura said as she grabbed Tomoyo`s arm and pulled her 
into the house. 

They looked in the rooms of the house. &quot;Well.... Seems like no ones 
home&quot; Sakura said blushing at her coment. 

&quot;Not even Kero?&quot; Tomoyo asked surprised as Sakura nodded her head. 

Sakura looked at Tomoyo not sure if she should or not. *This feeling 
is killing me!* she sceamed in her head *I feel like I`m going to 
explode if I don`t-* she stopped as she felt Tomoyo`s perfect, soft, 
red lips ontop of hers. She pulled back, regeating it, but she had to 
know. &quot;Tomoyo.... Why...?&quot; 

Tomoyo blushed going in for another kiss giving Sakura a simple, but 
breath taking answer. &quot;Because I love you&quot; 

Sakura stopped breathing, thinking, and felt as if she had lost 
consiousness. She exploded into tears and hugged Tomoyo tight. Quite 
taken back Tomoyo smiled sweetly and hugged Sakura back, knowing that 
this meant she felt the same. &quot;Sakura~chan...&quot; Tomoyo said not sure if 
she should comment on Sakura`s not saying it back. 

Sakura looked up at Tomoyo, her face was stained with tears, but 
Tomoyo knew they were tears of joy. &quot;I love you too.... I love you so 
much, Tomoyo~chan.....&quot; she said wiping away her tears as she gently 
leaned forward to kiss Tomoyo, pushing her lightly onto a wall as 
Sakura slowly and gently parted Tomoyos lips softly running her tougue 
along Tomoyos top lip before slowly entering Tomoyos mouth. Tomoyo 
slid her tougue along Sakuras as it entered her mouth, tilting her 
head, letting Sakura take control. 

&quot;Hey Sakura~chan! I`m home!&quot; Touya yelled from behind them as they 
tried to push away fast enough for him not to notice. &#39;What was that 
just now... Looked pretty damn good to me...&#39; he thought as he tried 
hard to push those thoughts aside. &quot;Were you two just...?&quot; Touya 
started still trying hard to push his perverted thoughts aside 
focusing on his little sister. His innocent little sister kissing 
another girl. &quot;Get out....&quot; he slowly said to Tomoyo. 

&quot;Touya~chan!&quot; Sakura yelled at her brother running to him. 

Touya gently pushed Sakura aside, and again, more roughly said &quot;Get 
out, Tomoyo~chan!&quot; Tomoyo tried not to cry and think of the worst as 
she picked her bag up and ran out the door. 

&quot;I hate you!&quot; Sakura yelled pushing Touya and running up to her room. 
&#39;Stupid onni~chan! I wish I could just...&#39; 

&quot;Sakura~chan..?&quot; she heard Touya`s soft kind voice from the door, but 
she didn`t answer. &quot;Sakura~chan...?&quot; he said nicely again, but a bit 
more agressive. 

Sakura gave in, rudely answering, &quot;What?&quot; Touya took that as an 
invitation and slowly opened the door and walked in cautiously. 
&quot;Touya~chan....&quot; she said with tears in her eyes trying to refrain 
from hitting her bother. 

&quot;I`m sorry Sakura.. I KNOW your not ready for that kind of 
relationship yet... Even that damn kid Li would be better than her at 
your age&quot; Touya said smiling, Sakura wasn`t smiling though, she WAS in 
love with Tomoyo and nothing her brother said could make her change 
her mind. 

&quot;You baka, Touya~chan!!&quot; Sakura yelled at him. &quot;You don`t know how I 
feel so stop pretending! I saw that look on your face when you first 
walked in!&quot; 

That coment made Touya blush, majorly. &quot;What look?&quot; 

Sakura rolled her eyes and coldly said, &quot;You know the look, don`t be 
stupid Touya~chan&quot; 

Touya knew he deserved that, and really didn`t know why he was so mean 
to Tomoyo, but he also knew, that the only thing he could do would 
seem kind of weird, but he had to do it. &quot;I`m sorry Sakura~chan...&quot; he 
said, meaning it. He quietly walked out of the room and closed the 
door. 

As he was walking down the stairs, he heard the door bell ring, hoping 
it was Yuki he ran to the door openning it with a bright smile, only 
to see it was the person he didn`t want to face right now. 
&quot;Tomoyo~chan....&quot; was all he could get out. &quot; I....&quot; 

Tomoyo looked at Touya with her dark blue eyes peircing through him. &quot; 
I will not let you part us!&quot; she yelled. Touya backed up, he`d never 
heard her use such force in her voice, hell, she`d never heard herself 
use such force in her voice. &quot; I cannot let you keep me away from 
Sakura.. Wether you like it or not, I love her, and we WILL be 
together!&quot; 

Touya smiled and almost laughed because he was of his foolishness. 
&quot;I`m sorry Tomoyo, I don`t mind it that you and Sakura~chan are.....&quot; 
he thought for the right word. &quot; &#39;Lovers&#39; &quot; he continued, &quot;Just as 
long as you don`tt hurt her, its ok.&quot; he said with another cute&#39; Touya 
smile&#39;. 

Tomoyo smiled and ran up the stairs to comfort her lover. She felt 
relieved, like Touya`s words had let her live again. She bursted into 
the room seing Sakura curled up in a little ball. 

&quot;Are you ok, Sakura~chan?&quot; Tomoyo said sweetly as she aproached the 
bed quietly laying down next to Sakura. 

Sakura was surprised to hear Tomoyo`s voice as she quickly realized 
that her brother really had accepted it. &quot;I`m great, Tomoyo~chan!&quot; 
Sakura said searching for Tomoyos soft pale hand, saying again, but 
this time with more passion as she found Tomoyos hand and brought it 
to her lips kissing it lightly, &quot;I love you, Tomoyo~chan&quot; 

All Tomoyo could do was smile and give Sakura a soft kiss on lips, 
continuing where they left off, but Sakura pushed away, and rolled 
into Tomoyos arms. &quot; I just want to stay like his for a while 
Tomoyo~chan...&quot; Sakura said closing her eyes and letting her head rest 
on Tomoyos chest. Tomoyo pulled Sakuras body closer as she gently gave 
her a kis on her head. 

&quot;So we shall&quot; Tomoyo said closing her eyes also falling asleep soon 
after. 

Touya quietly came in, pulling the covers over them, gently giving 
Sakura a kiss on the cheek, looked at Tomoyo and patted her on the 
head, not wanted her to get the wrong idea if she woke up. &quot;Good night 
you two&quot; he whispered, quietly leaving the room again, smiling at the 
thought of his little sister and her first love. </pre>
