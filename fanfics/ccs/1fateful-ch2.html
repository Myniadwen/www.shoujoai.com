<a href="../ccs/1fateful-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>THE CONFESSION THAT WAS LONG OVERDUE. 

&quot;Hey Sakura!&quot; 

&quot;Hey Tomoyo.&quot; 

&quot;Well, I brought your new Battle Costume.&quot; 

&quot;Great.&quot; Said Sakura. &quot;Can you just put it over there for now? I&#39;ll try 
it on later.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s ok, there&#39;s something I want to ask you anyway.&quot; Said Tomoyo. 

&quot;Can it wait a bit?&quot; Says Sakura. &quot;I thought that we could have some tea 
and sweets before we got down to business.&quot; 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Says Tomoyo. 

&quot;Great, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; 

When Sakura returned with the Tea and Sweets Kero had made his way into 
her room. He had gone outside for a nap, so he didn&#39;t know about what 
happened earlier. 

After they were finished, Sakura took the dishes downstairs to the 
Kitchen, then promptly returned, eager to try on her new Costume. But 
before she could say anything, Tomoyo had asked Kero if he could give 
them some privacy. 

&quot;No problem.&quot; He said. &quot;I think I&#39;ll go back outside to finish taking my 
nap anyways.&quot;  

After Kero left the room Tomoyo sat Sakura down on the bed and asked her 
if anything was wrong. 

&quot;Not really.&quot; Said Sakura, trying her hardest not to blush. 

&quot;I know you, you&#39;ve got something on your mind and I&#39;m not going to stop 
pestering you until you open up to me and let me know what&#39;s going on.&quot; 

&quot;What should I say?&quot; Thought Sakura. &quot;If I just come out and say it, 
She&#39;ll probably end up thinking I&#39;m weird and hate me for it. But I 
can&#39;t go on like this forever. Every time I see her or confide in her 
about something, my heart aches at the thought of me not being able to 
tell her.&quot; 

&quot;No!&quot; She thought. &quot;Tomoyo has always been there for me, no matter what 
it is, she deserves to know how I feel about her. But... I have no idea 
how to tell her.&quot; 

&quot;Sakura? Sakura?&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot; 

&quot;Are you ok?&quot; 

Sakura grabs Tomoyo&#39;s hand in hers and looks straight into her eyes. 

&quot;Tomoyo.&quot; says Sakura, her eyes filling up with tears. 

&quot;You&#39;ve always been here for me no matter what the problem is, you&#39;ve 
helped me through countless thing in my life.&quot;  

By this time Sakura can&#39;t hold back the tears from streaming down her 
cheeks. &quot;You&#39;ve stuck by me, no matter what the cost, You&#39;re a true 
friend Tomoyo, and I need to tell you.&quot; 

Now Tomoyo is starting to cry herself upon hearing this. 

&quot;I need to tell you that...that.&quot; 

&quot;Yes?&quot; Says Tomoyo.  

Sakura bites down on her lip. &quot;I... I.. love you Tomoyo!&quot; 

&quot;I know.&quot; she says, trying in vain to hold back her own tears. 

&quot;Huh? You do!?&quot; 

&quot;Yes Sakura, I&#39;ve known for a long time that you have a very special 
place in your heart for me. I could feel it. You and I have been dear 
friends for a very long time now. After a long time a person can tell 
when their friend has feelings for them. The only reason I know this is 
because I share the same feeling towards you Sakura.&quot;  

&quot;Huh?&quot; Said  the still sobbing Sakura. &quot;You do? Really?&quot; 

She looks up at Tomoyo, her eyes now filled with tears of joy and her 
heart no longer aching to tell her friend how she feels. 

Sakura then pulls Tomoyo against her and they both start crying once 
more. It seemed like that embrace lasted for hours. They were just 
sitting on the bed holding and confessing their love for each other over 
and over. 

Sakura suddenly pulls away and says: &quot;Oh! Oh my gosh, I&#39;m sorry! I 
totally forgot about the Battle Costume you made for me!&quot;  

&quot;It&#39;s ok... I think that what you had to tell me was a little more 
important than a silly Battle Costume.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not silly.&quot; Says Sakura. &quot;I love the Costumes you make for me. 
They make me feel even more special to you.&quot; 

Tomoyo blushed at the comment. &quot;Thank you.&quot; She said bashfully. 

&quot;Now, lets get down to business shall we?&quot; 

&quot;Right!&quot; Says Sakura as she heads over to the package that Tomoyo 
brought with her. She picks it up and brings it back over to the bed. 

At this point Tomoyo is sitting in a chair beside Sakura&#39;s desk, 
watching her. Sakura stands beside her bed and takes off the top to her 
school uniform. 

&quot;I&#39;ll hold that for you.&quot; Says Tomoyo. 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Said Sakura.  

She then proceeds to take off her skirt, again giving it to Tomoyo to 
hold onto. 

As Tomoyo folds up Sakura&#39;s clothes she glances back toward Sakura to 
see what progress she has made on getting ready. When Sakura bends down 
to pick up the Costume Tomoyo notices that Sakura&#39;s bottom is really 
red, and still a bit swollen. 

&quot;Sakura!! What happened? Why is your backside all red?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s nothing. Touya caught me snooping in his room after he told me 
not to. So he put me over his knees and gave me a Spanking.&quot; 

&quot;It was really embarrassing, I mean I&#39;m not a kid anymore. I&#39;m 
practically a woman now!!&quot;  

&quot;Are you ok? It looks like it hurts.&quot; 

&quot;No it doesn&#39;t hurt much anymore. It was more embarrassing than 
anything.&quot; Says Sakura. 

Tomoyo was upset. She new that Sakura was lying that it still hurt, and 
was only trying to keep her from worrying too much about her, but the 
girl that she loved was in pain and she knew that there wasn&#39;t much she 
could do for her, which only made her even more upset. </pre>
