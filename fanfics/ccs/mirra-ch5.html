It started as Mirra walked upstairs to go to the bathroom on the first 
floor.

But, in a sense, it started way back in November.

A sharp sensation.

-----

Flashback --- November 2003

It happened in New King Penguin Park.

For months a question loomed over the women who were once cards.

They were human, and had a part of their powers -- but why were they 
human -- and where was the rest of their powers? The answer came the 
day Sakura&#146;s class went to the aquarium, and she saw what she thought 
was Water&#146;s power.

That same day Water (Umi) ran into someone who should have angered her 
to the point of violence, yet she didn&#146;t have it in her anymore. Her 
once intense emotions were dulled, her sharp rage rounded and blunt. 
She had lost her edge -- or to be more precise, her edge had taken a 
life of it&#146;s own.

She deduced that part of her persona, her &#147;animus&#148; if you will, had 
been separated from her when she became human. The part of her which 
craved being a &#147;card&#148;, which enjoyed the quiet solitude of being 
&#147;sealed&#148; in the subtle twilight of the &#147;world&#148; that existed for cards 
at rest. That part of her didn&#146;t want to live in the waking world, it 
wanted to be what it was meant to be, a card.

She wasn&#146;t alone. After sealing Animus Watery, it became clear that 
other cards like it existed.

Animus Woods, Animus Windy, Animus Light, Animus Dark -- but was there 
an Animus Mirror?

It seemed unlikely. Mirror was still at full power, unlike the rest, 
so they assumed she had no Animus. But in the park that day, as Sakura 
fought Animus Windy, she learned she did have an Animus.

And it&#146;s name was Mimic.

Confused and disoriented, it didn&#146;t follow suit with others (wanting 
to be a card), instead it wanted to be what Mirra didn&#146;t want to be 
--- it wanted to be powerful. Mimic used her power to slowly gain an 
illusion of strength, but more and more lost her way and ceased caring 
about being a card, or even being a powerful card, she now just wanted 
to be. To exist. To survive. To that end, with her now fragmented 
memories (which she never truly possessed in full being only a part of 
Mirror) she saw Mirror (Mirra) as a threat to her existence. Whipped 
into action by &#147;memories&#148; of a lost love, she filled in the gaps with 
her own growing prejudices and hates, and (being a flawed being) 
formed a flawed hatred of an innocent girl.

Mirror, aka Mirra.

While the other &#147;cards&#148; fell easily, with no real motivation to being 
free, Mimic wasn&#146;t so easy to capture. She may had been, in the end, a 
flawed &#147;creation&#148; but she was still a cunning and dangerous creation 
nevertheless. However, it was on that day that she learned of her 
&#147;birthing&#148;, that she was only a piece of Mirror and not a unique being 
all her own. Records of her &#147;past&#148; she forged herself, creating her 
own alternate timeline by accident by the force of her desire to 
simply &#147;be&#148; someone unique.

She rejected that straight away. In her fractured mind she couldn&#146;t 
accept the truth that Mirra was proposing to her. It was too much to 
bear. She tried to attack an unsuspecting girl and use her as a 
bargaining chip against Mirra, but Mirra beat her to it. She simply 
thought hard on Mimic, and stabbed her own arm with a sharp object. As 
Mimic grabbed her potential &#147;hostage&#148; she felt a sharp searing pain in 
the place Mirra stabbed herself and stumbled (allowing the girl to 
escape).

But that was then, this is now.

End Flashback.

------


Back in the here and the now.

In that instance Mimic knew that Mirra was telling the truth. And it 
broke her.

She fled, crying hysterically, unable to come to terms with this 
knowledge.

It took her over a month to come to grips with it, and then to use it 
to her advantage. Which she was doing at this very moment. Mirra 
almost fell down the stairs from the shock if Hikaru wasn&#146;t there to 
catch her. It ripped through her from crotch to head and surged. But 
it was nothing she felt before.

In her mind&#146;s eye, Mimic held tight to her image of Mirra, and held it 
tight as her hatred shielded her from the pain that ripped through 
Mirra full force.

Hikaru took her quickly upstairs, each moment sending a new shock 
through Mirra&#146;s body. As she fell onto her bed she felt as if someone 
was groping her. &#147;Mirra? What&#146;s wrong??&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know! I---&#148; Then it happened. She gripped the bed and 
screamed. Her eyes were wide open, body shivering with arms and lead 
spread out to brace herself as if she was afraid the room would flip 
end over end and flip her out to fall into nothing. At first it was 
piercing, then--- it began to hit her over and over again. &#147;Agh!! 
NONONONO!!&#148; she cried, her breath panting as it gripped her.

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?!? MIRRA!!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s--- it&#146;s--- goddess--- AHH!!&#148;

Her body screamed and yet responded to her &#147;attackers&#148;, but that 
didn&#146;t matter at all to Mimic. The pleasures coming from it came from 
the dark thoughts of how much Mirra was hurting now. To complete the 
cycle she used a celphone she stole to call her. Information easily 
gained from a few reliable sources. Hackers. They were easy enough to 
get to do the acquisition of all she needed to know to reach out and 
torment Mirra even in the safety of Daidouji Estates. Sex tends to pay 
the bills easily enough, and she didn&#146;t care since they were all tools 
to her anyway. Humans, in general that is, she didn&#146;t care. They were 
made to serve those more powerful than they were, which she most 
certainly was in her opinion.

The phone rang. Hikaru, too intent on Mirra, didn&#146;t notice at first, 
but it kept ringing and ringing.

&#147;I&#146;M!!---goddess I CAN&#146;T!! I CAN&#146;T!!&#148;

&#147;What? Wh--?&#148; (she answers the phone) &#147;NOT NOW!!&#148;

&#147;---why--- not?&#148; she heard the coy oily voice on the opposite end of 
the phone whisper. It took abit of effort to speak while she was being 
assaulted, but she didn&#145;t want to miss a single second of torturing 
the little human girl. Oh, no, she most definitely didn&#145;t want to miss 
that.

&#147;I told you--- pant pant--- I&#146;d find--- pant--- a way---&#148;

Hikaru face faulted. &#147;Mimic.&#148;

Suddenly Mirra jumped to a sitting position, grabbing tightly to 
Hikaru holding her, &#147;MAKE IT STOP!! MAKE IT STOP!! I&#146;M GOING TO---&#148;

Mimic screamed as she finally succumbed to the violence overwhelming 
her senses and Hikaru knew what was happening. She held Mirra tight as 
she screamed as well, shuddering violently as she came down from her 
forced moment.

She laid shivering in Hikaru&#146;s arms, crying, &#147;---why?!? Why?!?&#148;

On the opposite end of the phone, Hikaru could hear Mimic panting. 
&#147;You bitch.&#148; she hissed.

They knew their roles well. She knew they would act true to form. Men 
drunk out of their skulls, they didn&#145;t even give a damn she was having 
a conversation while they raped her. They were too far gone and too 
wasted to care. As long as she didn&#145;t hinder their &#147;fun&#147; they didn&#145;t 
give a damn what she did. She watched the last one to assault her take 
the knife, and she braced herself muttering &#147;I can&#146;t die--- I can&#146;t 
die--- I can&#146;t die---&#148; over and over again.

&#147;What? What are you---&#148;

Mimic looked up at her &#147;attackers&#148;, and smiled.

One of them held her naked form down, knife raised.

She held her teeth tightly shut, and closed her hands into fists.

She wanted to hear it. She had to hear it.

The knife fell, and Mirra screamed.

The pain was intense, but through it all as she listened, Mimic did 
something that chilled even the blood of her &#147;attackers&#148;.

She smiled.

Several hits later she finally allowed herself to breath, her hard 
breaths ragged and pained. She then turned off the celphone, looked 
up, and whispered two words. &#147;My turn.&#148;

The next screams to fill the air was theirs.

As she finished she knew she couldn&#146;t do that again for awhile. It 
took abit of effort and energy to do it all, and she needed to rest, 
but --- still --- it was fun. Knowing how much it hurt Mirra it was 
fun.

She idly kicked aside one of the corpses and walked away, blood 
dripping from her nude form.

&#147;I&#146;ll have to be sure to send Mirra my condolences and schedule 
another &#147;funtime&#148; soon for us.&#148;

------

Mirra was in shock. Her eyes wide open. She could barely speak. All 
she could do way cry.

Hikaru did not leave her side, she merely held onto her and cried her 
own tears.

It took awhile, but she finally got help for Mirra when Tomoyo came in 
to check on them.

Sakura took the news the hardest. She collapsed onto the floor of 
Mirra&#146;s bedroom and cried bitterly as her daughter was taken out of 
the room to be treated by a doctor friend of Nina&#146;s. All Tomoyo could 
do was comfort Sakura as she cried, knowing that rage would soon 
follow, then blame and self hatred.

Hikaru was the bravest, which is what everyone said as she stood by 
Mirra and watched over her (giving her comforting presence to her 
friend as she was examined and treated). &#145;They don&#146;t know.&#146; she 
thought to herself, &#145;They didn&#146;t see me crying like a baby earlier. 
They didn&#146;t see---&#146;

She felt Mirra squeeze her hand, and looked down. She was still abit 
scared, but a thin smile was forming on her lips. She was trying to be 
brave, even now, and it gave Hikaru abit of encouragement.

It was now 6:59PM, 11:59PM in Citadel City.

It was almost time.

------

Where was everyone when it happened?

Tomoyo was leading Sakura into the holochamber which was now set 
partially as a medico center to treat Mirra (Chief Medical Officer 
Adri Talbot being the doctor present). Sakura had gone through her 
cycle of rage/self-hate and grief, now all she wanted to do was help 
Mirra heal.

Everyone else was there, watching Mirra (no longer watching the events 
in Citadel City).

Mimic was wandering to her &#147;lair&#148;, stopping briefly to &#147;dress&#148; herself 
(using her power to &#145;create&#146; a layer of clothes around her body using 
abit of her soul energy to make the material from nothing) as she 
watched the coverage of midnight fast approaching Citadel City being 
shown on a TV from an electronics store (located next to a clothing 
store).

Fight sat cuddled up on the couch with her beloved, watching the 
events as she ate happily.

Power, who felt a slight dread when Mirra was &#147;attacked&#148;, sat with her 
friends watching the events unfold across the Pacifica.

In Citadel City itself eyes were turned upwards, but for some their 
attention wasn&#146;t to the coming fireworks but to the coming of 
something more sinister.

&#147;Readings are going off the scale!&#148; one of the monitors yelled out.

&#147;It&#146;s time.&#148; Admiral Nobringa whispered, as Midnight struck---

---and everything seemed to stop.

Midway through the report of the celebrations news stations kicked 
over back to the news desks as reports started to flood in. Something 
was happening in ElseSpace.

Something big.

All eyes either turned to the sky, or to vid screens, as the news 
unfolded.

The portal, with one final push, opened wide and let the Dyson Sphere 
through.

At first it didn&#146;t seem big, but as more and more of the huge 
moon-like sphere appeared it soon became apparent that it was as big 
as a large planetary moon. Across it&#146;s metallic surface was huge dome 
shaped crystals of various colors, the rest of the &#147;moon&#148; being 
comprised of a flawless metal with oval shaped &#147;apertures&#148; dotting 
it&#146;s otherwise smooth surface denoting entry portals.

No escort ships appeared, at least as of yet, as it completely entered 
into ElseSpace, it&#146;s portal back shutting behind it. CLAMP School had 
come to the Realm of Dreams.

The Command Center was abuzz with activity. Everyone was directing 
whatever sensor capabilities and satellites at their disposal towards 
the new &#147;star&#148; in the sky, and waited to see what the first batch of 
readings would reveal. Whatever it was, besides what Jack Lazarus 
revealed earlier? It was daunting to say the least. A real puzzle, and 
a real threat all in one.

Several flights of fighters launched from one of the orbital stations 
to pace it at a far distance while assisting with the information 
gathering. It seemed peaceful enough though, from a distance.

Like a slumbering giant. Though one best left sleeping it seemed if 
earlier attempts to &#147;gauge&#148; it&#146;s potential in the form of unmanned 
probes were any indication of the threat it posed if &#147;awaken&#148;.

Mirra felt abit of relief, all the attention shifting away from her so 
she could quietly converse with Hikaru. She seemed strong, but felt as 
if she was going to start crying again at any second. Mirra whispered 
soft words of encouragement as they held hands, smiling the whole time 
wanting only to be brave.

In light of the threat above? She must have been the bravest person on 
the planet or so it seemed to those around them who stole brief peeks 
at this &#147;private&#148; moment between the two. She pulled Hikaru towards 
her, and cradled the now crying girl in her arms whispering softly. A 
few minutes ago her world was a hazy mist of pain, but now all she 
could think of was soothing away the pain her precious felt.

&#147;I&#146;m useless--- so useless---&#148; she whimpered softly, as Mirra held her 
tightly.

At that moment she felt awful. She wanted to be strong for Mirra but 
she couldn&#146;t. She felt so weak, unable to protect Mirra from danger 
that loomed so near yet out of reach, she felt useless. She thought 
&#146;If only I was more like Auntie Hikaru,&#146; (her namesake that Umi-mama 
named her for) &#145;then i&#146;d be strong for Mirra-chan. If only---&#146;

It was just as well that everyone&#146;s attention was focused away, Mirra 
thought to herself, she wanted to spare Hikaru from the prying eyes of 
the curious while she was at her lowest ebbs. The news coming in 
seemed to demand their attention, and for good reason. Something the 
size of a moon had just came into ElseSpace, and it loomed large over 
Terra and Lunaris as it did, purpose : unknown.

Numbly Hikaru watched as Mirra fell into a sleep of sorts, the 
medication finally taking effect. As her hand slipped from Hikaru&#146;s, 
she felt as if she had to do something. Then she remembered--

Flash of memory. Face down in Tokyo Tower as Mimic assaulted her.

The significance of her dream was hard to grasp before. She didn&#146;t 
know what to make of it.

Did Mimic kidnap her to torment Mirra? Was she unlucky and ran into 
Mimic? What was happening? She didn&#146;t know and the more she pondered 
her dream in secret the more confusing it got.

The significance of dreams. To be more precise her dream. She didn&#146;t 
understand it at first. But now she did. It all made sense now. She 
was there, at this time, not because Mimic wanted her, because she 
would force Mimic out into the open. She knew what she had to do. It 
was so simple. She went over to one of the tables where someone left 
their celphone, picked it up -- and closed her eyes.

Once, when she was taking care of Mirra after Mimic first assaulted 
her, she became deathly afraid when she walked in on Mirra and she was 
having a convulsive fit in her sleep. It looked so painful that she 
couldn&#146;t bear to watch, yet was held in place by her fear. Her hand 
quickly grabbed the nearby phone and dialed blindly. She heard a voice 
on the opposite end, &#147;Ashitara Mini Mart.&#148;

She frantically asked if a Umi Ryuzaaki was there. The clerk, at 
first, was abit taken back, thinking it a prank, but Hikaru was 
frantic. She checked, and sure enough Umi was there. She calmed Hikaru 
and told her that Mirra was only having a nightmare, and that she had 
to comfort her. It took Hikaru awhile to realize, later, what she had 
done.

Without knowing where her mother was she managed to reach her. On her 
first try. At a place she never been to before, let alone knew the 
number for. On her first try she reached her mother and yet she 
shouldn&#146;t have. Why? Then it dawned on her. She was thinking of her at 
the time. In her panic her thoughts locked on her and her mind 
scrambled to ask &#147;What would Umi-mama do if she was here?&#148;

She learned, after some &#147;tests&#148; of her own, that she had a small bit 
of precognitive sense. If she focused hard enough on somebody? She 
could find them without fail. In fact she could even call them without 
missing a beat. Once she tried this (calling Fuu) and failed several 
times, only to realize that she was hitting payphones along a stretch 
of road that Fuu was walking on at the time (Fuu said the phones kept 
ringing as she passed them, and she didn&#145;t know why).

It worked best when she thought of Mirra. All she had to do was close 
her eyes, and think of her, and she could &#147;sense&#148; where she was. It 
took a little practice, but she later became able to track close 
family and friends (to a degree) simply by desiring their presence, 
wanting to be close to them, and letting her ability feel them out for 
her.

Mimic was basically Mirra&#146;s Animus, her primal side and yet a part of 
her which Mirra rejected. Something about her that she didn&#146;t want to 
hold onto anymore, something negative. All that negativity flowed out 
of Mirra when she became human, and went into Mimic (including a part 
of Mirra&#146;s powers). Why didn&#146;t she know this happened? Because each 
regained power from a simple yet opposing feeling. For Mirra it was 
happiness, first from Tomoyo/Sakura, then from herself towards Mirra. 
For Mimic it was hatred, first of Sakura then to Mirra. But still, 
they were one in the same.

She held an image of Mimic, and through her pain she quickly snapped 
open the phone and dialed blindly. Seconds passed as she waited, 
then---

&#147;---&#148; (nothing, but she knew Mimic was listening)

&#147;Tokyo Tower. One hour. Meet me.&#148; (she then hung up).

That&#146;s it. Now all she had to do was go there, and finish it.

The significance of her dream became clear.

She was the same as Mirra. The exact same.

-----

Hikaru&#146;s Flashback

She held onto Mirra tight, smiling down at her. &#147;Your exhausted.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m--- gasp gasp--- sorry! So little---&#148;

&#147;You made me happy.&#148; she admitted honestly, feeling her face glowing 
red from their dual shared moments of release. &#147;Your perfect 
everytime.&#148;

&#147;But it wiped--- me out--- gasp---&#148;

&#147;Catch your breath and we&#146;ll do it again.&#148; Hikaru whispered.

&#147;Fingers and oral only? And I--- gasp--- I&#146;m so weak.&#148;

&#147;Your perfect.&#148; she corrected, kissing her.

-----

She blushed a little at the thought as she snuck out of the house, 
headed towards Nina&#146;s shuttle parked in the back, holding up the 
shuttle&#146;s keychip she &#147;borrowed&#148; from Nina&#146;s jacket slung on a chair 
back in the holochamber.

Mirra wore out after sex, and from the sound of Mimic over the phone? 
She wore out too. Plus she had suffered a great amount of &#147;damage&#148; 
being attacked, and probably expended energy to heal herself, and kill 
her attackers. That means her strength was at a low ebb right now. All 
she had to do was let Mimic win, rape her, and then when she was 
weak---

Punish her.

She slips quietly into the shuttle, and uses it&#146;s teleporter to take 
her to Tokyo Tower.

All eyes were skywards, so nobody noticed the flash of lights from the 
darkened tower, or the fact that somebody turned on the lights in the 
Tower (shut down in observance of the New Year Holiday).

-----

The situation had turned into a stalemate of sorts.

With fighters and ships taking position between Terra and the Dyson 
Sphere, everything went silent as people waited for it to make the 
next move. Hours seem to pass, but as everyone in the room stared at 
the vid screen, it was Adri who first noted that Hikaru was gone. 
Everyone&#146;s attention suddenly went from the vid screen to the room, 
noticing that she was indeed gone.

&#147;What the---&#148; Keiko muttered, holding her phone up. &#147;Somebody used 
this-- this isn&#146;t a number I recognize at all.&#148; (dials it, silence) 
&#147;Hikaru?&#148;

Phone hangs up.

&#147;Mimic.&#148; she rasps, looking at the phone in her hand. &#147;Can&#146;t be-- but 
still--&#148;

&#147;Who else would Hikaru call out, after what she did.&#148; Nina concluded, 
grabbing her jacket. &#147;But how did she find Mimic&#146;s number? She must 
have stole that celphone so it&#146;s not like it has her name all--- 
over--- it??&#148;

&#147;Nina, what&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;My keychip&#146;s gone!&#148; Nina yelled, hands ruffling up her jacket in a 
frantic search. &#147;IT&#146;S GONE! GONE! My keychip&#146;s GONE!&#148;

Keiko&#146;s eyes widen. &#147;Not the one for---&#148;

&#147;YES THE ONE FOR THE SHUTTLE!! IT&#146;S--- oh no.&#148; (grabs commlink) 
&#147;COMPUTER!! HAS ANYONE USED THE TELEPORTER?&#148;

&#147;Affirmative.&#148;

&#147;WHAT? WHERE??&#148;

&#147;The Ryuuzaki Residence, Tokyo. Then she accessed the teleporter via 
commlink and set destination to Tokyo Tower.&#148;

Silence as everyone looks about, confused.

-----

Hikaru sat crosslegged on the floor, eyes staring dimly out the huge 
windows overlooking Tokyo. Her heavy overcoat wrapped around her body 
to keep the cold out, and to hide her &#147;secret&#148;. She didn&#146;t want to tip 
her hand to Mimic just yet. She had an ace up her sleeve.

When she arrived at home she knew she didn&#146;t have much time. She 
quickly, yet quietly, snuck into the huge museum like collection room 
and walked up to the three glass cases holding the armors and swords. 
Each a remembrance of what came before, one for Umi, Fuu, and Hikaru. 
Their armors, and swords, on display (with reverent hopes that they 
never have to be used again for any circumstances).

Hikaru could open the cases easy enough. She liked to touch the smooth 
armors and feel the cool metal of the swords beneath her fingertips. 
She could touch, but never take the swords. She knew what could happen 
with each sword but right now she had to take one, she just hoped her 
blood would give her the &#147;means&#148; by which to take one of the three 
swords on display. She first went to Umi-mama&#146;s. If there was one 
sword she felt in her heart she could take it was this one. 

Each sword levitated in a circular anti-grav &#147;well&#148; generated from the 
case itself. That way the sword hung freely for people to look at it, 
and also could be easily accessed by it&#146;s owners in an emergency.

Carefully, with slightly jittery hands, Hikaru reached into Umi&#146;s case 
and grasped onto the sword&#146;s handle. It felt smooth to the touch, and 
yet solid. &#147;I can do it---&#148; she whispered, pulling the sword towards 
her, only for it to fall apart and turn into a freefloating mass of 
water suspended in the anti-grav field. Confused by this Hikaru 
quickly yanked her hand free allowing the sword to reform again. &#147;Why? 
I&#146;m her daughter. Why can&#146;t I--&#148;

Undaunted by her failure, she tried Auntie Fuu&#146;s sword. She touched 
it, tugged it slightly to one side but quickly stopped, feeling the 
weight of the sword slowly increase as she edged it towards her. That 
sword wasn&#146;t going with her either it seemed. Dejected she closed the 
case and turned her attention to the last sword remaining - Hikaru&#146;s 
sword.

She, of course, was named after it&#146;s owner, and even resembled her. 
But resemblance in name and appearance didn&#146;t make her the rightful 
wielder of said sword. And she knew that it would &#147;burn&#148; a person (to 
their soul) whoever tried to take it who wasn&#146;t Hikaru. Still, as she 
opened the case and reached in, it was nothing compared to the pain 
she felt when she thought of what Mimic did to her precious.

She grabbed the sword handle hard, yanked it free, and held it tight 
waiting for the searing pain.

Pain which did not come. As she slowly opened her eyes she realized 
she was holding Hikaru&#146;s sword as if she was always meant to wield 
said sword. She gave it a few test swings, and held it out to look at 
her reflection in the glass of the case. It was her, all right, 
holding the sword -- but how? She didn&#146;t have time to ponder it. She 
took Umi-mama&#146;s armor (if she couldn&#146;t use her sword, she&#146;d at least 
wear her armor) and slid Hikaru&#146;s sword into Umi&#146;s jewel glove to 
store it. She then make her connection to Tokyo Tower.

But that was sometime ago. She was still waiting for her &#147;nemesis&#148; to 
arrive.

As she waited it gave her time to reflect on what happened, and what 
was going to happen. In retrospect she didn&#146;t like at all the path she 
was about to go down, but she knew in her heart it was the only way. 
As far as Mimic was concerned? Mirra was a &#147;target&#148; that she would 
never stop pursuing, never stop tormenting, insuring her precious 
would suffer endlessly in doubt and now pain from her tormentor unless 
someone put a stop to it. She knew that she had to be that someone, 
for Mirra and their friends &amp; family who suffered whenever they 
suffered. She had to stop Mimic once and for all.

Even if it meant killing her. She had to be stopped. That&#146;s when she 
heard the footsteps.

&#147;Your early.&#148; she whispered, getting up in a way to keep herself 
shielded from Mimic&#146;s prying eyes with her coat. She didn&#146;t want Mimic 
seeing her armor just yet. Mimic, entering the room slowly, looked at 
her with great disdain, &#147;Your bossy.&#148; she whispered, pacing slowly 
around her watching her closely, &#147;Anyway I&#146;m only 5 minutes early. So, 
now what?&#148;

&#147;I want you to leave Mirra alone.&#148; she responded, watching Mimic 
closely. It was as if she knew something was up, and was nervous about 
it with her pacing -- or maybe she just knew that her strength was low 
and she didn&#146;t have enough energy to keep going before collapsing.

&#147;Leave her --&#148; (a thin smile forms on her lips) &#147;-- your kidding me! 
That&#146;s it?&#148;

&#147;Isn&#146;t that enough?&#148;

&#147;For you it&#146;s more than enough.&#148; Mimic tossed back, pacing about 
Hikaru like an enraged animal looking for an opening, yet keeping her 
distance. &#147;But not for me. Why should I leave her be after what she 
did to me all those---&#148;

&#147;Delusions. You know Mirra never--&#148;

&#147;Delusions?!?&#148; Mimic hissed, her rage building as she paced. &#147;I know 
what she did!&#148;

As she paced about in circles, Hikaru kept a close eye on her, keeping 
her coat closed at all time to hide her armor, and since it was a long 
overcoat that covered from head to near foot she could keep her armor 
hidden. &#147;Mirra would never have slept with Clow Reed. And if she did? 
It was YOUR doing that--&#148;

&#147;ARE YOU STILL GOING ON ABOUT WE&#146;RE THE SAME?&#148; she screamed, edging 
closer and closer as she ranted, &#147;I can feel her in my mind, and vice 
versa, and perhaps we ARE connected, but I am NOT the spawn of her 
body. I am NOT her! I am my own individual person! She didn&#146;t make 
me.&#148;

&#147;Your delusions made you.&#148; Hikaru answered, eyes narrowing, &#147;Your just 
bad memories that refuse to die.&#148;

&#147;SHUT UP SLUT!!&#148; Mimic screamed, eyes tearing up as she did, &#147;YOU 
DON&#146;T KNOW HER WELL ENOUGH TO SAY DIFFERENTLY!!&#148;

&#147;I know her, and you, more than you want to admit.&#148;

At that Mimic froze, teeth grinding together. She was going to move. 
Hikaru knew this because she&#146;s seen this look in Mirra&#146;s eyes when she 
gets angry. Not at big things, or people, but at times she gets 
flustered over little things. Once, on the way home from school, she 
and Hikaru were harassed by a wild dog. It blocked their path and 
threatened to bite them. Mirra&#146;s eyes narrowed, her teeth clenched, 
and her face turned red. They were going home to watch a favorite TV 
show, and she did NOT want to miss it.

The next thing the dog knew, it was being charged at by an enraged 
young woman, her eyes glaring as she attacked it. It suddenly yelped 
and ran, not even bothering to take a bite. In truth? People shouldn&#146;t 
do that, wild dogs aren&#146;t normally scared that easily -- except when 
the girl&#146;s eyes are glowing and shards of glass are flying everywhere 
around her as she charges. She felt bad about it later, but it showed 
Hikaru what Mirra -- and in a sense Mimic -- looked like before they 
went into attack mode.

Mimic screamed one more time, an animalistic yell, before she charged 
straight out at Hikaru.

Now was the time to act. Quickly she threw her robe at Mimic and drew 
her blade, slashing through Mimic as she passed, cloak over her head 
confusing her. As she stumbled past she grabbed her now bleeding side, 
breath ragged. &#147;Animal.&#148;

Mimic&#146;s eyes blazed as she pulled herself together. Her hands relaxing 
to her sides as she stood up shakingly, blood ceasing as her wound 
closed. &#147;You -- bitch --&#148;

Hikaru jumped forward to slash her down again, only to meet with air 
as Mimic jumped aside, back pedaling quickly as she unleashed a 
torrent of glass shards at Hikaru. She quickly swept the air as she 
ran, deflecting &#147;shots&#148; as she ran, a few however hitting their marks. 
One scarred her face (cheek), three slashed her arm in an exposed 
spot, two went into her shoulder but vanished as immediately as they 
embedded, their &#147;illusion&#148; breaking when they snapped within her 
flesh. The pain was unbearable but she ran forward anyway, taking huge 
swings at the retreating Mimic. &#147;BITCH!!&#148;

&#147;Mistress -- never could -- master the cards!&#148; Mimic taunted, staying 
out of range as she fired a fresh volley of shards. &#147;Never figured out 
that she could combine cards for better results!&#148;

As the shards whacked the metal flooring like bullets Hikaru grabbed 
for her overcoat to use as a shield against the falling &#147;rain&#148; of 
bullet-shards. &#147;I&#146;m using THREE powers now. Shot, combined with my 
illusion shards makes for a deadly rain of &#147;bullet glass&#148;! Dash --&#148; 
(before Hikaru knew it, Mimic was upon her lashing out with a kick 
that she could barely dodge) &#147;-- for speed!! And --&#148; (as Hikaru spun 
to attack she moved quickly out of the way again) &#147;-- Power to keep 
Dash&#146;s power at peak efficiently without losing the speed ability!&#148;

&#147;Dammit---&#148; Hikaru rasped, feeling her odds dimming as she watched 
Mimic stay clearly out of range of her sword with her superior speed. 
&#147;Mistress never figured out that some cards could augment other cards! 
Like for instance how Power could be used to lift heavy objects -- or 
power cards maxing out their abilities past their normal limits!&#148;

Once again she got behind Hikaru, barely clipping her left arm as she 
kicked, knocking her sword aside and sending the girl flying into the 
observation windows from her one clip at her body. She screamed as she 
hit the glass, her impact breaking the window causing huge cracks to 
form in it, her left arm hurting like hell but still intact and in 
it&#146;s socket. Mimic, however, was on a roll.

&#147;Dash alone can only go for short distances with super speed, but 
augmented with Power&#146;s boundless energy and Dash&#146;s power becomes an 
endless source of super speed!&#148; she remarked casually, once again 
coming up behind Hikaru, this time to take her down with one hard 
slap. The speed enhanced blow didn&#146;t connect, but the wind it 
generated knocked her off her feet and sent her crashing into the 
ground, screaming again in pain. Every nerve in her body was 
screaming, her pain was intense, yet Mimic was barely harmed. The 
significance of her dream became clear -- she tried to fight Mimic, 
and lost.

Mimic, however, was still in a good mood. She reached over and rolled 
Hikaru on her stomach, pulling her up on all fours. &#147;Still, if I 
really am like Mirra then I deserve to test the &#147;merchandise&#148;.&#148;

She numbly felt Mimic grasp her skirt, knowing fully well from her 
dream what was coming next.

&#147;Mirra-chan---&#148; she rasped, tears flowing as she realized she was 
about to be raped, and it was all her fault. She failed Mirra, and 
herself.

Suddenly silence. She heard nothing, then felt a cold wet splash of 
something on her exposed rear. She turned and saw an amazing sight. 
Mimic, frozen in place (apparently about to &#147;augment&#148; herself 
sexually) was impaled on Hikaru&#146;s sword (through her heart), behind 
her was Hikaru in full armor and quite angry as she twisted the sword 
still shoved through Mimic&#146;s body.

In a cold, angry voice she spoke, her words a soft hush yet filled 
with rage.

&#147;Leave her alone you BITCH!!&#148;

At that Hikaru spun about, using her momentum to hurtle Mimic through 
the broken window that Hikaru shattered earlier, the glass breaking 
with a loud crash as Mimic&#146;s body fell into the darkness of the night 
outside. She hurtled out into the air and fell -- but as she strained 
to listen, she didn&#146;t hear a sound.

Nothing. Not even an impact.

She turned towards Hikaru, and for an instance she thought that her 
auntie was angry with her -- but instead she was crying, her face now 
filled with joy and concern at the same time. &#147;I said a bad word.&#148;

&#147;Auntie--- arggh!&#148; Hikaru froze up, pain shooting through her body. 
She tried to jump up to her, but her body was wracked with too much 
pain to move. She crumpled into the ground sobbing as she felt the 
others surround her, hands prodding and trying to take care of her.

She felt so awful at that moment. Such a disgrace. She stole her 
mother&#146;s armor, her auntie&#146;s sword, and nearly got herself killed. She 
must have looked like such a loser, her mind dimly reasoned in it&#146;s 
pain, half dressed and bloodied. She felt two strong arms wrap around 
her lifting her into the air. She turned, look and saw the warmest 
eyes and most gentle features. She wasn&#146;t in full control of her wits 
so as she slipped into unconsciousness she rested her head against her 
chest and whispered &#147;---daddy---&#148;

Then she saw no more.

Captain Jack Lazarus gulped nervously as everyone looked at him. 
&#147;Uh--- not me -- I think.&#148;

-----

Nothing had happened of importance since Hikaru left.

Starships from the Alliance and Dominion came to blockade the sphere, 
but as of yet it had not made a move or stirred in terms of comm 
chatter or ship movements from the sphere. For the time being it sat 
there and waited.

It was now January 2nd, 2003.

Hikaru found herself bedmate to Mirra as they healed from what 
happened.

Hikaru tried to apologize for being so rash but Mirra only smiled and 
said &#147;Just never do it again.&#148;

Jack was easily let off the hook when Umi explained that she knew who 
Hikaru&#146;s father was. He decided to explain it to them in the 
holochamber, set to Tokyo Tower (rooftop) which now provided a good 
view of the small &#147;sphere&#148; in the sky which was the Dyson Sphere.

&#147;Ascot?&#148;

The entire room fell into silence as she talked. Jack joined in and 
helped, &#147;One of Keiko&#146;s unintentional accidents. It seems when she 
left with this Umi from one of the variant Cephiros she accidentally 
left a void that needed filling. Something had to be done to restore 
order so---&#148; (shrugs) &#147;---I took advantage of the situation and made a 
new Umi.&#148;

&#147;You what?&#148; Keiko sighed, looking at him. &#147;And don&#146;t tell me, let me 
guess -- it fell in love with Ascot and they got married?&#148;

&#147;Not exactly.&#148;

&#147;Not exactly? Not exactly?&#148; Keiko stood up, eyes locked on Jack who 
was now backing away nervously, &#147;What do you mean by &#147;not exactly&#148;? 
Come on, boss, spill!&#148;

Jack stops, hand raised in the air pointing at Keiko, &#147;You know that 
you only call me boss when your really, really angry? And---&#148;

&#147;JACK!!&#148;

&#147;Sigh.&#148; (Jack waves Keiko off) &#147;Ask him yourself! Ask him yourself! He 
lives on the Central Hub teaching with his wife at the Academy. Care 
of Magical Creatures (if you can believe it)!&#148;

&#147;His wife?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll see.&#148;

Keiko didn&#146;t know if she wanted to &#147;see&#148; or not. Just then Tomoyo came 
into the room holding an envelope, &#147;It&#146;s for you Sakura.&#148;

She carefully opened it, and inside was -- &#147;Animus Mirror?&#148;

Everyone turned their attention towards it, away from Jack (much to 
his overall relief), and looked. Sure enough it was the Animus Mirror 
card, the last of the six Animus cards.

&#147;But how---?&#148;

&#147;Maybe Mimic is dead?&#148; Umi, who had been sitting in the back listening 
Jack explain (glad she didn&#146;t have to) said, &#147;She&#146;s dead, right? 
Hikaru impaled her on her sword and flung her through a window. She&#146;s 
dead.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t think so.&#148;

It was Jack. Everyone turned to look at him, causing him to blush. 
&#147;You all make me nervous when you do that!&#148;

&#147;Jack.&#148;

Suddenly he became deathly serious, &#147;I don&#146;t think she&#146;s dead. In 
fact, I think she might be on her way to reform.&#148;

&#147;Reform?&#148; Sakura whispered, holding the card up.

&#147;Maybe she can tell us that -- when we see her again. And I have a 
feeling that we will see her again. Sooner than we think.&#148;

------

In a dimly lit Medico chamber she laid.

The watery tank of healing liquids doing it&#146;s work on her, putting her 
back together.

Her heart had been rended in two, and her power was too weak to heal 
that and her broken body. Somebody else did that for her. But right 
now, in her tank, she didn&#146;t think of that or healing.

Her mind was occupied.

In the harsh pain of her defeat she felt the last barrier in her mind 
open, and she knew why she was.

Her deepest memories was of being called by Clow Reed.

His hand touching her face softly, praising her.

Taking her to bed.

And then --

She gritted her teeth, and looked at her own reflection in the medico 
tank and snarled.

She did have a purpose. One clear and solid purpose after all. After 
all she went through.

She was where Mirra took all her bad memories of Clow Reed, what he 
did to her, and shoved it into a form to dispose of. As she came into 
being in the world as a human being a dark part of her didn&#146;t want to 
take this pain with her, so it was all bundled up and discarded, like 
trash.

Just like she was, in the end, trash.

As she looked at herself she could feel Clow Reed&#146;s touch in her mind.

She was nothing more to him than a little girl that he created, and 
abused, and---

Her fist pounded silently into the glass, her eyes narrowed. She hated 
him.

Hated Mirra for bringing her into this world. Hated Hikaru for showing 
her weakness. Hated that red haired woman who showed her pain. And, 
most of all, she hated herself.

That&#146;s when she heard a singing in her head, and turned to face her 
savior. She smiled and touched the glass, whispering to Mimic one 
thing. &#147;What do you want more than anything in the world?&#148;

Mimic&#146;s mind was a jumble, but her hatred focused her thoughts, &#147;I 
want to die.&#148;

She smiled, and then she reached into Mimic&#146;s mind and began to clear 
her thoughts, impressing a sense of calm. Still, Mimic held tight to 
her hatred of the one thing she loathed the most, and refused to 
forgive more than any of the others, she held fast to her hatred of 
herself.

&#147;No redemption?&#148;

&#147;What if I just want to die.&#148;

&#147;Follow me and I can give you redemption.&#148;

Mimic sighed inwardly, her resistance fading as she fell back asleep 
under her &#147;touch&#148; in her mind.

&#147;I just want to die.&#148;

&#147;Follow me and I can give you that too.&#148;

Then, nothing.
