Somewhere over the Pacifica Dream Ocean

In the dimly lit room he paced about his associate, watching the 
sitting man as he did. With every step his armored boots clanked 
against the metal flooring, making an odd click-clack-click-clack 
noise as he walked. Holocaust, his black and gold armor glistening in 
the dim light, regarded his &#147;associate&#148; as he spoke.

&#147;The world stands at a crossroad. With this &#147;CLAMP School&#148; occupying 
the sky above, and the threat of Clow Cards about the land, this would 
have been an ideal time to launch a subversive assault.&#148; he smiles as 
he continues to pace, eyes never leaving his still silent companion. 
&#147;Bringing us Assassin Guilders&#146; together and offering us just about 
anything imaginable just to retrieve your little Sailor Soldier girls 
so you and your remaining associates could once again enjoy their 
&#147;company&#148; was quite an proposal. We take them down, you have the fun 
of making babies with them and putting them in little tubes to freeze 
until you wanted to make more babies in them -- or was it just the sex 
and torture that was the fun? I could never tell. I know you would 
emphasis all the joys of whipping, beating, slicing and raping young 
women --&#148; he said, walking forward to stand next to the man as he 
plucked his head from his limp shoulders, &#147;If you weren&#146;t already 
dead. But that&#146;s what you get for being sick retarded bastards who 
thought more with their penises than their heads.&#148;

He held the head aloft, staring into the shocked expression on the 
face at the moment of death. &#147;I wonder how it must have hurt you so to 
realize that we only went along with your lovely schemes if only to 
gather you all together. But, then again, you did believe that nothing 
is more valuable than a den full of 12-14 year old girls stripped 
naked and willing to please.&#148;

He spins on his heels, chucking the head back into it&#146;s body which 
knocks the whole ensemble into the flooring with a loud thump. 
&#147;Strictly speaking I&#146;m not a loliconer, even if Code 8 forbade rape 
(which it does mind you). But just between you and me? I think it was 
the 1 million credit a crotch reward by the Winterian forces that 
purged your world of your filth that made all the difference to me.&#148; 
(smiles as he looks at the body) &#147;Fun is fun, but money makes the 
galaxy rotate.&#148;

With a slight salute he taps a button on the wall, and makes his exit. 
As he does the floor slowly yawns open and drops the body into the 
darkness below. &#147;Well I have work to do. Our advance units have been 
on the ground for a week now and have been receiving resistance from a 
very interesting source. That I should check on, but you be a good boy 
and feed the sharks, will you?&#148; (as the body falls away, plummeting 
towards the ocean below, Holocaust waves slightly as the lift doors 
closes behind him). &#147;Now there&#146;s a good lad.&#148;

Inside the lift, Holocaust pulls something out of his armor&#146;s belt 
pouch and holds it up to the light. &#147;At least I got credit for your 
sick spoiled soul. One credit down--&#148; (flips blood red coin into the 
air, catching it inside a tesseract sphere freshly drawn from a 
tesseract pouch at his side) &#147;--one hundred more souls of the damned 
to go.&#148;

Tokyo (the Dream Continent of Nippon)

Over the kitchen countertop in Sakura&#146;s &#147;lab&#148; hung a simple looking

New King Penguin Park

Tomoyo jumped back, hand still grasping her camcorder as she filmed 
Sakura&#146;s bravery against the Sand card. Eve, however, was having a 
time of it barely holding Sand&#146;s relentless attacks back with her 
NovaShields. If she was hoping for a lax day today then she was sorely 
disappointed.

Keiko jumped back, backpedaling as she slashed at the shots of sand 
coming straight at her, taking as much sand in the hair and face as 
she reflected away with gusts of wind. Even with her protective 
gasmask from one of her tesseract pouches she was still being 
overwhelmed by Sand&#146;s attacks.

The huge King Penguin slide shook as the sandy ground beneath it 
liquefied and began to suck it in. Sakura barely had time to leap onto 
the back of the huge slide and climb up to the two trapped kids on the 
top. Eve, hands full protecting three young girls with her NovaShield 
spell, turned her attention towards Nina. &#147;Give Sakura some cover 
fire!&#148; she yelled, continuously fortifying her NovaShields spell with 
her willpower.

Nina, lugging her pulse rifle upwards, carefully took shot after shot, 
clipping each sand tentacle as it tried to latch onto Sakura to drag 
her down, all the while slowly dragging the huge penguin slide 
downward into the now liquid sand beneath it. &#147;Nina! Behind you!&#148; 
Eliza suddenly yells out, just as two sand tentacles attack Nina from 
behind. She barely manages to dodge them as the whoosh over her, her 
rifle firing blindly upwards as she tries to nail them.

Tomoyo, filming Sakura&#146;s heroic acts, cringes inwardly as she watches. 
&#145;All the trees are too far away.&#146; she thinks to herself, &#145;I can&#146;t use 
Gaia&#146;s ring to help Sakura-chan -- but maybe --&#148;

Tomoyo&#146;s free hand raises upwards, Gaia&#146;s ring pulsating with energy, 
&#147;Trees! Use your roots to cut down Sand&#146;s tentacles!&#148;

Almost instantly long strings of roots shoot out from the ground near 
the trees, whipping through the air hacking into each sand tentacle 
that rises from the ground. As the tree roots keep Sand occupied, 
Sakura reaches the two children and grabs onto them, using Windy&#146;s 
ring to give her a boost over Sand and onto the grass in one long jump 
from slide to safety.

As she sends the children to Eve for protection, she turns and regards 
Sand, her hand bearing the Water ring rising into the air. &#147;Umi! Give 
me your strength in the form of a waterfall to restrict Sand!&#148;

From above a shimmering disc of blue begins to form, the air growing 
dry as moisture is drawn into the circle and condensed. From that 
circle a powerful blast of water shoots into the sandy ground, soaking 
it through and through making the entire sandy pit into a dense clump 
of sand. From the quagmire, Sand&#146;s true form appears, covered in the 
sandy gunk and bogged down by it&#146;s weight. Quickly Sakura rushes up 
and slams her staff down, &#147;CLOW CARD RETURN TO YOUR POWER CONFINED! 
SAND CARD!!&#148;

Tendrils of energy shoot out, encapsulating the card&#146;s physical form, 
transforming it, and turning it back into a card. It shoots into the 
air, and lands in Sakura&#146;s hand.

Nina, dazed and dirty, turns and claps from her resting position on 
the ground, &#147;You did it!&#148;

As everyone gathers around Sakura, whose blushing, Tomoyo taps her on 
the shoulder, &#147;Now all we need to do is retrieve King Penguin.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; Sakura asks, confused, &#147;What do you---&#148; (stops and looks) 
&#147;---hooooeeee!!!&#148;

King Penguin rested half trapped in the sand, tilted at an awkward 
angle. Nina, putting her rifle down, moves in a mock stumble towards 
the slide and screams &#147;Damn you!!&#148;

&#147;Yeah, yeah, Planet of the Apes. Figures.&#148; Keiko grumbles, annoyed by 
Nina&#146;s antics. &#147;Get a life.&#148;

It takes a little effort, and the tech shuttle of Nina&#146;s which she 
summons to the park via remote, but eventually the penguin is dug out 
and set upright again. By the time the news crews arrive everyone had 
already left and the situation was resolved.

The Daidouji Residence

Keiko sat quietly on the second story balcony outside of 
Mirra/Hikaru&#146;s room, watching the clouds roll by.

She had been rather quiet since Eve went to see her parents, and yet 
she didn&#146;t seem angry or frustrated, she just seemed deep in thought. 
Suddenly she turns and smiles, motioning for Tomoyo to join her 
outside. &#147;You alright?&#148; she asked, &#147;You seem rather worn down today. 
Sand?&#148;

Tomoyo shakes her head, &#147;No. Not Sand, but---&#148;

Silence reigns for a bit, until finally ---

----

The night before

Shh. Tomoyo&#146;s sleeping.

While dreams, true dreams that those of the waking world take for 
granted, are not to be had here, dream they still can (in a sense). 
Instead of dreams they see visions.

Sometimes to occupy a mind craving something to fill the void between 
&#147;darkness&#148; and the light of &#147;dawn&#148;.

Sometimes to help the person remember something, or someone.

Sometimes it&#146;s a hint or a clue to something yet to come -- or a 
painful reminder of what came before.

For Tomoyo it&#146;s the last of these which has her dreaming.

Tears flowed hotly down her face, stinging her eyes and making her 
face red.

Sakura was back, and she was her&#146;s -- but at a price.

When Sakura came back she was on cloud nine, then it happened. She 
became sick for no reason, and her mother began to dread. She was 
taken to the hospital and --

Tomoyo wakes up, eyes glancing about the darkened bedroom. Suddenly 
she could feel movement to her side, and knew she wasn&#146;t the only one 
up. &#147;What&#146;s wrong, Sakura-chan.&#148;

For what seemed like forever there was only silence, then in a thin 
whisper she said &#147;Why can&#146;t we have children? Children of our own I 
mean. Mirra-chan is a beautiful daughter but-- I mean--&#148;

Tomoyo lowers her head, knowing that it had finally come to past. The 
day she had dreaded was here. She had to tell Sakura the truth now. 
She laid back, and at first tried to be relaxed about it. &#147;Girls can&#146;t 
make girls pregnant, remember?&#148;

&#147;But -- with the stuff they have today? Can&#146;t we -- can&#146;t we make a 
baby? I mean, I&#146;ll work hard to get a job as a mage after school and 
become the best mistress of the cards in the world so I can support 
you and our baby! Can&#146;t we --&#148;

&#147;Money isn&#146;t the problem, Sakura-chan. You can&#146;t bear our child 
because I&#146;m not -- suitable -- to bear offspring with you. No magical 
lineage.&#148;

&#147;But --&#148;

&#147;And I can&#146;t bear our child because -- papa made me sterile.&#148;

&#147;---Tomo-chan---&#148; Sakura rasped, Tomoyo already picturing Sakura 
shoving her fists into her mouth in the darkness to stifle her 
whimpers. With that she grasped Sakura tightly, drawing her shivering 
body close to comfort her at tears rolled down her face. &#147;It&#146;s 
alright. It&#146;s alright.&#148;

&#147;But why--- how---&#148; she cried, no doubt confused by what Tomoyo said. 
With a deep breath she rolled herself onto her back, drawing Sakura 
with her, so she could slowly tell her what happened.

&#147;When you returned, do you remember a few weeks later when I became 
sick? And I had to go to the hospital after awhile?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148; Sakura answered meekly.

&#147;Well -- that day --&#148;

----

Tomoyo&#146;s flashback

Tomoyo sat on the bed of the doctor&#146;s exam room stunned. She reached 
down and slowly ran a circle about her belly beneath the cloth of the 
examination robes she wore, then she drew a figure eight.

Sonomi wouldn&#146;t stop crying. She didn&#146;t want Tomoyo to see her cry, 
but she knew that mother was crying in another room. Tomoyo was 
pregnant. Her &#147;father&#148; had made her pregnant.

With that she clenched her eyes shut and damned her &#147;father&#148; for the 
first time in her life.

She lost her virginity to him. Her first time. And now, she could lose 
Sakura&#146;s love if she knew -- she saw only pain and regret in this yet, 
as she touched her belly with one finger, she wondered what it would 
be like to have a daughter of her own. But her mother wasn&#146;t ready for 
it, and neither was she.

Her mother&#146;s money made a lot of things appear in Tokyo, but that day 
she used her fortune to make something disappear --

----

The night before

&#147;Abortion?&#148; Sakura whispered, feeling Tomoyo nod her head. &#147;Mother 
said I was too young to have a baby of my own while I was still a 
&#147;baby&#148; myself. I couldn&#146;t raise my child properly, and I feared -- I 
was going to lose you if you knew I was -- burdened with child.&#148;

&#147;Noooo -- noooo -- I wouldn&#146;t have left you -- I love you!!&#148;

&#147;I know! I know!&#148; Tomoyo cried, holding Sakura tighter, &#147;But I was so 
afraid, and I didn&#146;t know what to do! I leaned on mother for support 
and she told me that I had to have an abortion! I couldn&#146;t say no, but 
I didn&#146;t want the baby to die so I -- asked them to -- remove the baby 
so it could be born by another.&#148;

&#147;Is that -- possible?&#148; Sakura asked, &#147;Yes.&#148; Tomoyo said, &#147;But in the 
end -- there was a mistake.&#148;

----

Tomoyo&#146;s flashback

Sonomi was furious.

She looked ready to kill. Her screams echoed throughout the hospital. 
She was ready to kill someone.

Tomoyo laid in her hospital bed stunned. She couldn&#146;t move.

When Sakura came to see her she put up a brave front, hiding the 
truth.

They did it in one day. With the technology of the 23rd Century, and a 
fortune fueling the job&#146;s costs, Sonomi had her former husband&#146;s 
&#147;mark&#148; removed from Tomoyo -- but it was too fast. In her rush she 
pushed too hard, and because it was done that day they couldn&#146;t 
prepare for all the possible repercussions of saving the slowly 
growing fetus instead of killing it outright.

When she came out of the operating room Tomoyo was sterile. The 
operation damaged her reproductive systems beyond hope of repair, even 
with 23rd Century tech. It was a fluke, a one in a million mishap 
often practiced for in Medical School, but that didn&#146;t comfort Sonomi 
who blamed herself and the doctors for the damage caused to her 
precious baby.

Sonomi was on the edge of a breakdown, but she hid it from Tomoyo to 
keep her spirits high. She agreed to take anti-depressants, 
medications, anything to keep herself together if only for Tomoyo&#146;s 
sake.

But Tomoyo felt cheated by this.

She couldn&#146;t lose her virginity to Sakura.

Sakura couldn&#146;t be her first.

And now she couldn&#146;t even bear Sakura&#146;s child.

Everything pure and wholesome she ever dreamed about was taken away 
from her by her father.

Her first time, her first child, but not her first love.

When Tomoyo turned 14 Sakura gave her a beautiful ring and vowed one 
day to be her one and only. That day Tomoyo cried, and Sakura thought 
she angered her friend. She smiled, tears flowing down her cheeks, and 
whispered &#147;But I&#146;m happy! I&#146;m so happy---&#148;

When Sakura turned 16 Tomoyo gave her a ring of her own, and gave 
herself body and soul. The minute she opened her robes, allowing them 
to drop to her feet baring her nude form to Sakura she knew that she 
would be Sakura&#146;s forever. But what she never told Sakura was the 
first time they made love she wanted to cry -- she felt like she was 
giving Sakura a ruined &#147;gift&#148;, a spoiled unwanted shell of a young 
woman that she had no right presenting to her beautiful Sakura-chan. 
Sakura, not realizing then about Tomoyo&#146;s misgivings, asked her why 
she was crying.

&#147;You deserve better than me.&#148; she whispered, to which Sakura replied 
&#147;But all I ever wanted is you. Ever since the day I realized how truly 
special you were to me, all I ever wanted was you.&#148;

From that day forward Sakura had never faltered, never failed Tomoyo 
once, never left her side. At times poor Sakura-chan beats herself 
down because she fells at times she isn&#146;t worthy of Tomoyo&#146;s love, to 
that she smiles. She herself felt so often that she could never be 
worthy of Sakura&#146;s love that hearing Sakura say that made her realize 
how petty and baseless her fears were. She would gently reprimand 
Sakura for her silly thoughts -- only because she had felt the same 
way time and time again, but realized that they were as untrue as 
Sakura&#145;s fears that Tomoyo did not love her. Finally, after a long 
time of soul searching and thought, Tomoyo came to the conclusion 
eventually that she was indeed worthy of Sakura&#146;s love, because she 
knew Sakura was always worthy of her love.

-----

The night before

Sakura reached down, and touched Tomoyo&#146;s belly, &#147;If I had the power 
to take back what happened to you, and give you a child of our love I 
would---&#148; tears rolled down Sakura&#146;s cheeks and she tried to hold them 
back, gritting her teeth to be brave. &#147;I would do anything for you -- 
anything.&#148;

&#147;Sakura-chan---&#148; she whispered, holding Sakura tightly. &#147;Let it go. 
Don&#146;t hold your tears back for me -- let it go--&#147;

As Sakura collapsed into her grasp, they held each other tight until 
all their tears were wept, and all their fears shed away in their warm 
embrace. Slowly their eyes fluttered close and they fell asleep held 
tightly together, the sound of their heartbeats lulling them to sleep.

-----

The present

Keiko nods her head, looking abit worn from the telling. &#147;I didn&#146;t 
know.&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t tell anyone.&#148; Tomoyo admitted, &#147;Only mother, Fuu, Sakura and 
you know -- and I trust --&#148;

&#147;That I won&#146;t tell a soul. Ok, leave it to me.&#148; Keiko whispers, 
winking at Tomoyo as she takes her leave.

Tomoyo sits down in the chair, and looks out over the yard.

-----

During lunch Nina gathered everyone together for a Clow Card update in 
the upper kitchen.

By this time Eve had returned and they were looking over the numbers.

&#147;---and with one more card---&#148; Nina erases the numbers, and jots down 
the new total, and new captured card count &#147;---we only have 25 more 
Clow Cards to find before we have the entire set.&#148;

&#147;Hurry! BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT! (Offer void in your area).&#148; &#147;Ed&#148; blurts 
out, smiling mischievously.

&#147;Whatever.&#148; Nina rasps, putting the marker down. &#147;Everyone see that?&#148;

All heads nod. Sakura/Tomoyo exchange glances as everyone stares at 
the board, eating away. &#147;I think your missing the big point though.&#148; 
Keiko mumbles through her food, &#147;What&#146;s next?&#148;

&#147;Well --&#148; Nina turns, regarding the board again as she sits and begins 
to eat, &#147;We know where Fight and Power are for starters---&#148;

&#147;Fat lot of good that&#146;ll do since Power is protected by the Assassin&#146;s 
Guild, and Fight would rather beat our heads in that give her power 
up.&#148; Keiko retorts, still munching away as she slowly taps her finger 
on the table, &#147;Though she&#146;s only holding on to her power to get the 
last man who attacked her and her boyfriend. Once he&#146;s out of the 
picture she might be more willing--&#148;

&#147;Keiko!&#148; Eve protested, to which Keiko quickly blurts out &#147;Not us! Not 
us! I&#146;m not saying we go hunt this guy down or anything, but once she 
gets it out of her system she might be more willing to give her 
power.&#148;

&#147;Fat chance.&#148; Kero remarks glumly, chewing his own food slowly, &#147;Fight 
isn&#146;t the type to give up anything so easily, least of all her powers. 
She&#146;s going to hang onto it forever and never give it up.&#148;

&#147;Pessimist.&#148; Cloud shoots out, her own focus on Kero and her food. 
&#147;Fight is always a big bully anyway, but once you kick it out of her 
you can get her powers no questions asked.&#148;

&#147;But that only worked the last time because Sakura had the Power card! 
And this time she doesn&#146;t have it!&#148;

&#147;Kero&#146;s right. We have to do it differently.&#148; Keiko said, motioning 
with her fork hand at the board. &#147;Is there any other outstanding loose 
card we can catch that&#146;ll make taking Fight&#146;s powers easier?&#148;

&#147;Power was our best chance. Though I suppose we could use the Shot 
card and attack from a distance--&#148;

&#147;NO!&#148; Sakura shouts, hands slamming down against the table. &#147;I know I 
can reason with her. I don&#146;t want to force her to give up her powers, 
I want to try and show her it&#146;s necessary for her to give it up of her 
own free will!&#148;

Keiko, however, wasn&#145;t buying this line of thought. &#147;As romantic as 
that may sound it&#146;s also highly impractical. Fight isn&#146;t the type of 
card that would --&#148; (Fuu enters) &#147;--yes?&#148;

&#147;There&#146;s someone to see Miss Sakura. She says her name is &#147;Fight&#148;.&#148;

Everyone exchanges glances, before all eyes fall upon Sakura/Tomoyo.

----

Downstairs they found Fight sitting on the couch in the reception 
area, fidgeting abit as she waited.

Sakura, abit nervous, slowly walks up to her with Tomoyo by her side. 
&#147;Uh-- hi.&#148;

Fight looks up, a desperate look on her face, &#147;---mistress---&#148; she 
rasps before lunging into Sakura holding her tight. &#147;Please -- take my 
power now -- just take it --&#148;

Everyone looks at her confused, but Sakura is the only one who manages 
to muster the question &#147;Why?&#148;

Her story was quick and to the point.

Two nights ago she caught up to the last man. Her last tormentor.

She chased him through King Penguin Park, stopping his assault on an 
innocent young woman. When she finally ran him to ground she didn&#146;t 
stop to talk, to question, to scream -- she let her fists to her 
talking. Each shot of her fists filled the air with a sickening crunch 
crunch crunch as her vision blurred red with anger and her fists sent 
up spurts of blood that splattered across her body.

At last, after a whole minute she realized he was dead from the first 
hit. Her first blow snapped his neck and killed him outright, and 
since he was a Dreamling he wasn&#146;t going to be reborn like Fictionals 
or Half-lifes, nor was he going to &#147;wake up&#148; like Normals. He was 
dead. But she couldn&#146;t stop hitting him, she was angry and took it out 
on him.

She felt someone touch her shoulder, spun about and---

Fight chokes, eyes wide and she covers her mouth looking ill. She 
rolls over to one side sobbing hysterically.

Her lover had followed her. He wanted only to stop her, to comfort 
her. Her first blow shattered three ribs and dropped him to the ground 
in pain. When realization hit she wanted to panic, but she had to get 
him to a hospital. He was a dreamling, just like her attacker, if she 
didn&#146;t act fast he could die.

Now, after two days of dread, bedside vigils, and praying, once the 
worst was past -- the pain and panic hit her hard. She had been on 
adrenaline and fear for the past two days, but now that she was coming 
down from it she was gripped with pain, guilt, self hatred, and now 
realization. &#147;My -- it&#146;s bad -- it&#146;s all BAD -- if I didn&#146;t have my 
power -- if I wasn&#146;t so arrogant -- none of this -- none of this --&#148;

&#147;But without your power you wouldn&#146;t have met him, right?&#148; Kero asks, 
fluttering near her looking at her, &#147;You met him because of your 
power--&#148;

&#147;I could have met him without it! I didn&#146;t need to enter his life in 
that horrific manner -- he told me once that he never thought a man 
could be raped before -- he never felt -- goddess -- how could you 
understand what rape feels like, Kerberos?!? To be so utterly helpless 
-- feeling like you just want to die over and over again and then to 
hate the world and everyone in it because it hurts so much to be 
alive!&#148;

Tomoyo nods her head, &#147;I know how you feel--&#148; she whispers, kneeling 
next to her. &#147;I know what it&#146;s like.&#148;

Fight, confused, looks into Tomoyo&#146;s eyes. &#147;You --&#148; (stops, takes a 
deep breath) &#147;--it&#146;s true, isn&#146;t it.&#148;

Tomoyo nods her head. &#147;I wouldn&#146;t lie to you.&#148;

Keiko suddenly hustles everyone out of the room, and for once nobody 
protested.

&#147;Your -- father?&#148; Fight whispers, looking at Tomoyo curiously. &#147;I 
didn&#146;t think -- I thought --&#148; Fight takes a deep breath, swallowing 
hard, before continuing. &#147;Did Mirror tell you why she was &#147;born&#148;?&#148;

Tomoyo and Sakura shook their heads in the negative.

&#147;Clow Reed used to have a neighbor, she lived on a small farm near his 
complex with her young daughter. She was a beautiful woman in her 
30&#146;s, but it was her daughter that caught Clow Reed&#146;s eye. She was 
only 10 but she was quite a beautiful young girl. At first he tried to 
make her his apprentice in the magical arts so he could pass his 
mantle of world&#146;s strongest mage to her, but she had dreams of being 
an artist so she refused. He then created the Mirror card, and for a 
long time she walked around the complex in that girl&#146;s form. Whenever 
Clow used us and allowed us time out to &#147;mature&#148; we noticed her, but 
thought nothing of it. After all Clow Reed was quite set on a 
&#147;prodigy&#148; for his life&#146;s work so we thought he was prepping this card, 
Mirror, to mimic him when he died and carry on his work for him.&#148;

&#147;One night, after training, I went back to return to the deck in my 
card form -- that&#146;s when I heard it. I went to Clow Reed&#146;s bedroom to 
see what was wrong and I saw him -- taking Mirror in that girl&#146;s 
form.&#148;

Both Sakura and Tomoyo turned on Kero, who was still there, and he 
nodded his head. &#147;It&#146;s true. That&#146;s the dark feelings that bled from 
Mirra into what became Mimic. Her feelings of betrayal and heartbreak. 
Then again how would you feel if you were &#147;made&#148; by your own &#147;father&#148; 
for the singular purpose of being his sex toy? It screwed Mirror up 
big time. To wear another girl&#146;s body, and to be her in bed for sex? 
Who wouldn&#146;t be messed up? In the end, when he died and the book was 
sealed, she was a split personality. Her soft spoken gentle side, 
which became Mirra, and her nasty hateful side which became Mimic.&#148;

&#147;Then--&#148; Sakura realized, &#147;--the first time I met Mirror I was 
confronting Mimic?&#148;

&#147;Both, actually. I didn&#146;t realize it at the time, maybe I was hoping 
she mended in the long years in the book, but I was wrong. The Mirror 
you first met was two &#147;personalities&#148; in one. The nasty girl who 
framed you for her mischief, and the gentle girl who felt guilt for 
harming Toya, and reached out to him for compassion and found 
understanding and acceptance from him.&#148;

Fight nodded her head. &#147;But Mirror -- I mean Mirra is at peace now, 
right? Her past is put behind her-- if only Mimic could have had the 
same chance before--&#148;

Fight holds Sakura tight, eyes staring at if into a great distance, 
mind blanking out no longer wanting to think of anything.

As for Mimic?

CLAMP School

&#147;OH NO YOU DON&#146;T!&#148; Mimic screamed, jumping onto the next floor, using 
her power to change her boots into rollerbladed boots. &#147;You can&#146;t beat 
me like this!&#148;

She leaned forward, mimicking mistress Sakura&#146;s perfect blading style, 
and went full throttle after 20 Faces. He was on primitive old 
rollerskates, she was using the custom-made high end rollerblades used 
by Sakura herself, that gave her the advantage.

Still, he managed to reach the rooftop before her but she was right on 
his tail. As she hit the rooftop, blades retracting, she caught sight 
of him taking an aerial retreat via the use of a helicopter. &#147;OH NO 
YOU DON&#146;T!!&#148; she screams, switching her mimicking ability to 
Jump/Windy to take to the air, latching onto the helicopter as it 
lifted into the air with 20 Faces onboard.

&#147;LAND THIS THING OR SO HELP ME GOD I&#146;LL SHOOT THE ENGINE OUT AND SEND 
THIS THING CRASHING TO THE GROUND!!&#148;

Meanwhile, a few miles away --

&#147;Telling you that it&#146;s a crime for your teacher to have a relationship 
with you is probably a waste of my time, isn&#146;t it.&#148; Ryuuki thought out 
loud, her short auburn hair providing a limited distraction as she 
played with it with her fingers. &#147;You just expect far too much from 
people sometimes.&#148;

&#147;NO I DO NOT!!&#148; the 10 year old black haired raging engine of 
destruction screamed, wielding a dangerous stuffed alligator in one 
hand, and a lethal stuffed tiger in another. &#147;HE&#146;S TOO OLD FOR ME!! 
WE&#146;RE TOO FAR APART!! BUT I&#146;M HIS FAVORITE!!&#148;

Ryuuki scoffed, &#147;That&#146;s an atypical reply teachers give to all their 
students. Unless he or she is sleeping with them then they&#146;re most 
definitely their favorites, but that doesn&#146;t count with you since---&#148;

&#147;SHUT IT!!&#148; she screamed, animals flaying about like deadly scythes in 
her rage, &#147;THE CREEP!! THE JERK!! HE ABUSED MY HEART AND TRAMPLED MY 
FEELINGS!! I HATE HIM!! I&#145;LL NEVER STOP HATING HIM!! NEVER!!&#148;

The rage lasted a whole minute before she finally collapsed on the 
floor, out of breath.

&#147;The Dark Lord of the Plushies needs a breather I see.&#148;

&#147;---can it--- gasp --- gasp--- wheeze--- gasp---&#148;

Suddenly something crashes into the balcony outside. Something female, 
wearing a strange set of clothes.

Mimic - &#147;Well -- that could have went better.&#148;

-----

Meanwhile, back on Terra---

The only thing Sakura could think of saying was that Fight should 
think about it.

While it was true that Sakura needed to seal Fight&#146;s power, she didn&#146;t 
want to do it for the wrong reasons. She wanted Fight&#146;s blessings, and 
if it meant waiting a little while longer she was prepared to do so. 
So it was in this state of mind that Sakura, Tomoyo and Eve went with 
Fight so she could speak to her significant other and come to a 
decision on this.

The hospital was beautiful. The huge sprawling complex that was the 
Pacifica Rim Hospital had three huge buildings which were the medical 
complexes and patient recovery center. In the center of the three 
building complex was a giant park dubbed the Starlight Gardens, where 
patients and visitors alike took time to recover both physically and 
spiritually from what ailed them.

The patient recovery center was to one side of the huge park, and 
that&#146;s where Fight had to go. As the four crossed through the park, 
admiring the beautiful shade trees and lovely pond, Fight felt 
something was amiss. &#147;Something&#146;s wrong.&#148; she said, eyes glancing 
about nervously, &#147;Something&#146;s not right.&#148;

Suddenly something sped past the edge of her eyesight, barely catching 
her attention. Before she could spin about she felt a sharp pain as 
something impacted into her back sending her crashing to her knees. A 
second blow knocks her side over side into the ground, stunned. As 
Sakura and Tomoyo rush to her aid, a man in dark black armor steps out 
into the light and regards the group. &#147;So that&#146;s a Clow Card human.&#148; 
he said, glancing at her casually, &#147;Not impressed.&#148;

Before Sakura could utter a single word the four of them found 
themselves surrounded by a half a dozen armored beings, each a perfect 
match for the first one that confronted them. &#147;Assassin Guilder&#146; 
Drones.&#148; Eve rasped, eyes glancing back and forth at the Drones as she 
knelt next to Sakura/Tomoyo to protect them. &#147;You must be Raptor 
Guild.&#148;

&#147;I guess so--&#148; the leader remarked idly, tapping the insignia of a 
leaping velociraptor on the left breastplate of his armor, &#147;I am 
Decauter. Assassination is not the goal here today, simply --&#148; (holds 
up hypo) &#147;-- DNA extraction.&#148; (two of the Drone units hauls Fight up 
onto her feet, holding her tight) &#147;I&#146;d be very interested in seeing 
the kind of tightly wound DNA you have in your body. And then I&#146;d like 
to see if any of that DNA rubbed off on your boytoy in the hospital--&#148;

&#147;Leave him be.&#148; Fight growled, struggling against her captors, but 
still dazed and stunned from the first attack, &#147;Just take what you 
want and leave us alone.&#148;

&#147;I wish it were that simple, but I&#146;m supposed to bring you back and 
not let you go until we figured out what makes you tick--&#148; (taps hypo) 
&#147;--even if it leaves you in a rather-- unreturnable condition. But 
then--&#148;

A soft, sand music fills the air. At this a thin smile forms across 
Decauter&#146;s face, though no one can see it as he&#146;s wearing his armor&#146;s 
helmet. &#147;About time. Everybody heads up, we have a &#147;Sailor Trooper&#148; in 
our midst.&#148;

&#147;What--?&#148; Fight groans, glancing about, her eyes falling on a young 
woman in blue/green. Her hair short and blue, her clothes a mix of 
blue and green colors from the long coat, to the shirt and pants, with 
only black boots and gloves to add accentuation to her wardrobe. In 
her hands she held a shiny steel guitar which she slowly strummed. 
Fight couldn&#146;t help but chuckle. If only her lover was here right now, 
because this so reminded her of her significant other&#146;s favorite old 
TV show.

&#147;So what does the Guild want with Clow Card DNA.&#148; she slowly 
challenged, eyes locked firmly on Decauter. &#147;That&#146;s for me to know and 
you never to find out.&#148;

As Tomoyo and Sakura looked on, the two combatants braced themselves 
for battle. The drone troopers around them tensing for the blue haired 
woman to make the first move.
