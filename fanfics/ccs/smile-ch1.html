&lt;I still remember the night we met
You said you loved my smile&gt;

I&#39;ve known Sakura for so long. I can&#39;t imagine what my world would be
like without her. Somehow I always imagined we&#39;d be together forever. I
love her very much and I hope she understands that. I&#39;ve told her a
thousand times in the way I look at her, the things I say to her, the
things I do for her and the way I smile. She&#39;s always loved my smile.

&lt;But your love for me was like a summer breeze
Oh it lasted for a while&gt;

We went through so much together as she fought to save the world from
disaster. I was always there by her side &#150; cheering her on. I cherish
every moment I&#39;ve spent in her presence. It&#39;s a shame that videotape
can&#39;t always capture it all, but I remember. I could never forget &#150; the
thrill of being near Sakura just for a few moments is enough to last a
lifetime. It is enough for me just to have those memories. At least I
can keep telling myself that. I know a part of her will always love me
even if she never says it. We are best friends and we can never lose
that special bond. It&#39;s hard for me to admit that it will never grow
into more than that.

&lt;I could hold on a little tighter I know
But when you love someone
You gotta let em go&gt;

I know she loves Shaolan and I don&#39;t want to stand in her way. I want
her to be happy more than anything else and I know they belong
together. Sakura promises me that we will never lose touch and I
believe her. I would follow her to the ends of the earth to make sure
of it. I will always be the one she can come to when she needs a
friend. Her friendship means so much to me that I can push aside my
broken heart so she won&#39;t see the tears.

&lt;So I&#39;m gonna smile
Cause I wanna make you happy
Laugh so you can&#39;t see me cry
I&#39;m gonna let you go in style
And even if it kills me
I&#39;m gonna smile&gt;

I smile when I see them together. I can&#39;t help it. Making Sakura happy
matters more to me than any ache in my own soul. I can shed my tears
alone in the darkness, but I can never let Sakura see. Mine are tears
of emptiness and loneliness, but not sadness. I am happy for Sakura and
I smile so that she will know this. I want nothing more than to make
Sakura happy and I don&#39;t think could live with myself if I was ever
responsible for a single tear on her beautiful cheek. I know that if I
told her how much I loved her she would have to make a horrible choice
and I&#39;m not sure I could live with her decision. It&#39;s better this way.
I can hold it inside and she can go on with her life.

&lt;Kiss me once for the good times baby
Kiss me twice for goodbye&gt;

I stand before her now not sure what to do. I must say goodbye and let
go of all my hopes and dreams. It&#39;s just another day to her. We will
see each other tomorrow at school she reminds me as I struggle with the
word goodbye. My voice cracks and shakes a little. Yes. I know I say,
but my thoughts echo with the words it will never be the same. I blink
back tears and hope she doesn&#39;t notice. This is the hardest thing I&#39;ve
ever had to do, but I know I have to do it for her. Everything I do is
for her. As she turns away a sudden impulse hits me and I shout
&quot;SAKURA!&quot; She turns around and looks at me puzzled. I run to her and
throw my arms around her hugging her tightly. She returns the hug as I
whisper in her ear &quot;thanks for everything&quot; Sakura pauses for a moment
as our eyes meet. I try to hide my sadness, but I see my reflection in
her sparkling eyes. For a moment I wonder if she understands as she
kisses me softly on the cheek. &quot;Goodbye Tomoyo... I&#39;ll see you in
school.&quot; Two hands part and mine remains outstretched reaching for
something I can never have.

&lt;You can&#39;t help how you don&#39;t feel
And it doesn&#39;t matter why
Give me a chance to bow out gracefully
Cause that&#39;s how I want you to remember me&gt;

I watch her walk away and let out a deep breath I didn&#39;t realize I was
holding in. This is for the best, I remind myself. We will always be
friends and I will always be hers even if she can&#39;t be mine.

&lt;I&#39;m gonna smile
Cause I wanna make you happy
Laugh so you can&#39;t see me cry
I&#39;m gonna let you go in style
And Even if it kills me
I&#39;m gonna smile&gt;

At the end of the street she turns around. At first I am embarrassed
that I am still standing there, but my patience earns me a precious
gift as Sakura smiles brightly and waves at me before turning around
and rushing home. I smile and return the wave. The image will stay with
me always as an unspoken acceptance of my hidden promise to her. I will
always love you, but you must find your own love. Go and be happy
Sakura. You deserve it more than anyone else in this world. More than
me.

&lt;I&#39;m gonna smile
So you can find the courage
Laugh so you won&#39;t see me hurting
I&#39;m gonna let you go in style
And even if it kills me
I&#39;m gonna smile&gt;

Please ignore the tears on my cheeks because I am smiling.
