<h1>Remastered II (part 5 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster2-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>It took all of Mirra&#39;s strength to shut her eyes tight and resist the
urges within her.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?&quot; Mimic screamed.

Mirra shook her head, &quot;I won&#39;t do it. I love her... you can&#39;t... won&#39;t... make
me hurt

Her. Never.&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP!!&quot; (kicks Mirra again) &quot;YOU DON&#39;T KNOW LOVE!! DO IT!!&quot;

&quot;Hikaru-chan--- don&#39;t look.&quot;

&quot;STOP IT!! PLEASE STOP IT!!&quot; Hikaru screams, &quot;Please! Take me if you must
but stop hurting Mirra-chan!&quot; (Mimic looks at her) &quot;I don&#39;t care! I can&#39;t
stand watching her be hurt! Please!!&quot; (with that Hikaru takes her legs,
presses them beneath Mirra, and kicks her away gently but firmly), &quot;Just
get it done with already!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t understand!&quot; Mimic rants, walking back to Mirra, &quot;It&#39;s because
of her I lost the sense of myself! I lost myself trying to chase a dream
which she ruined by sleeping with the man I loved!&quot;

Mirra - &quot;I didn&#39;t---&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP!!&quot; Mimic kicks Mirra again, knocking her into a tree, &quot;I hate
you! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU!!!&quot;

&quot;N-no!&quot; Hikaru rasps.

Suddenly Mimic spins around to face her, eyes burning. &quot;You... if Mirra
can&#39;t live without you then I want to be your first then--- make her
watch your deflowerment. Break you...&quot;

SHAK! SHAK! SHAK! SHAK! SHAK!

Mimic shudders, looking down as blood dampens her clothes, her attention
spinning back to Mirra, who (bloodied and bruised) is slowly pulling
herself to her feet. &quot;Don&#39;t... touch... her you BITCH!!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have the guts to kill me.&quot; Mimic scowled, pushing the glass
shards out of her form with sheer willpower. &quot;While I have total control
over my form. I&#39;ll just push the shards out of myself...&quot; (smiles) &quot;But the
thought is tempting. Even you can&#39;t watch her forever. One night she&#39;ll
wake up with me over her, her dainty legs spread as I take her virgin...&quot;

A new sharper pain slams through Mimic as razor sharp glass slashes
through her arms causing her to stumble backwards. &quot;NEVER!! I&#39;ll... kill
you... first!!&quot; Mirra hissed.

Mirra - &quot;Slut. You... don&#39;t have the...&quot;

More shards rain at her but Mimic already is ready, mimicking Shield&#39;s
defensive ability to protect herself while she changes her form to water,
extracting the shards in her. &quot;You don&#39;t have the guts to kill me.&quot; she
repeats.

&quot;I won&#39;t let you hurt her!&quot; Mirra repeated, her rage building, &quot;I&#39;LL KILL
YOU!!&quot;

Mimic - &quot;Your still a bitch, Mirror.&quot;

&quot;Mirra!&quot;

Mimic - &quot;Whatever--- I&#39;m still going to make your little girl my whore
even if I have to come straight through you, you little freak!&quot; (snarls
at her) &quot;She&#39;s going to be my...&quot;

&quot;MIRRA-CHAN!! HIKARU!!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Mimic spins about, &quot;I&#39;m not ready for---&quot; suddenly Mirra comes
barreling out of nowhere, slamming into Mimic (her shield down from the
distraction) and knocking her into the ground. Mirra, raging beyond
anything she felt before, pummels her fists into Mimic

screaming again and again &quot;I&#39;LL KILL YOU!!&quot; as she lashes out. Finallytwo
strong arms wrap around Mirra and pull her off, Mirra&#39;s arms and legs
swinging like mad as she tries to get at Mimic.

&quot;Mimic! You&#39;ve gone too far this time!&quot; Sakura threatens, wand at the
ready.

Mimic laughs, &quot;Not far enough by far. Not far enough.&quot;

Suddenly the wind picks up to hurricane gust, stunning everyone but Mimic
as they stumble beneath the onslaught. Seconds later Mimic is gone.

&quot;NO!!!&quot; Mirra screams, &quot;She can&#39;t get away! Mimic you bitch COME BACK
HERE!! MIMIC!!&quot;

* * * * * *

Mimic, a good distance away, listens to the wind as she hears Mirra&#39;s
screams.

&quot;Now we&#39;re even.&quot; Mimic whispers, her clothes mending as she turns her
powers from her now healed body towards mending her Clow created dress.

* * * * * *

Nina &amp; Eliza hold Mirra down, her rage burning hotly. &quot;Mirra-chan, calm
down!&quot;

Hikaru - &quot;Let her go.&quot;

The two turn, as Hikaru walks up to Mirra and holds her arms out. &quot;I
won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;

At first Mirra is still in a rage, and comes at Hikaru hard with fists
swinging. Hikaru ignores the blows and grabs onto Mirra fiercely, wincing
at each blow but holding her tight. &quot;Please stop it, Mirra-chan! I won&#39;t
hurt you. Please stop it--- please---&quot;

Long seconds pass until Mirra&#39;s blows become weaker and weaker, until she
at last collapses into Hikaru&#39;s hold crying. For the longest time the two
hold each other, nothing else mattering but the two of them, as the
others watch. Sakura turns and storms off into the woods.

* * * * * *

Tomoyo finds Sakura pounding her fists into the ground, tears rolling
down her cheeks.

&quot;Sakura-chan?&quot;

For long seconds silence, but finally (as she stops hitting the ground
with her fists)---

&quot;She hurt our daughter, Tomoyo!! I hate her! I HATE WHAT SHE DID TO
HER!!&quot;

&quot;Sakura-chan...&quot; Tomoyo whispers, drawing Sakura to her knees and hugging
her tightly.

&quot;She... she hurt our... our precious... goddess, Tomo-chan she hurt
Mirra-chan...&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;I know. I know.&quot;

Tomoyo gently rocks Sakura in her arms, feeling her shoulder grow moist
from Sakura&#39;s tears. &quot;She means a great deal to you, doesn&#39;t she. Our
daughter.&quot;

&quot;We can never have children of our own... she was like a gift from heaven
to us. Our precious daughter... the one we could never have...&quot;

&quot;Sakura---&quot; Tomoyo raises Sakura&#39;s head so they could stare into each
other&#39;s eyes. &quot;I need to tell you something. The reason I can&#39;t give
birth---&quot;

&quot;Shh---&quot; Sakura puts her fingers to Tomoyo&#39;s lips, &quot;It&#39;s alright. I don&#39;t
need---&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;But Sakura---&quot;

&quot;Shhh---&quot; (Sakura smiles) &quot;---I can&#39;t give birth either, remember? I can
only conceive with another powerful mage ever since we came here--- but I
don&#39;t want another man or woman&#39;s child--- I want your child. I want to
feel the labors of OUR love growing inside of me! I want to--- I want to
give you a child born of our love.&quot;

&quot;Sakura-chan.&quot;

The two talk for awhile, until all the words are spent and all they have
left is their love holding them together.

* * * * * *

Back at the Daidouji Estates

&quot;Breakfast!&quot; Hikaru cheerfully called out, entering the room pushing the
cart as she did.

Mirra frowned, &quot;I could have came downstairs.&quot;

&quot;No you don&#39;t! Nina&#39;s doctor friend said you have to rest for the next
few days. Teachers gave me your work anyway so I&#39;ll help you with your
studies so you don&#39;t fall behind.&quot;

&quot;---I&#39;m sorry, Hikaru-chan---&quot;

&quot;For what, Mirra-chan?&quot;

Mirra lowers her head, &quot;I lost control. I hurt you--- I swore I&#39;d
never---&quot;

Hikaru - &quot;You were angry. It happens.&quot;

Mirra - &quot;But---&quot;

&quot;No buts, Mirra! Here--- but first---&quot;

Mirra - &quot;First?&quot;

Hikaru smiles. &#39;Would you--- be yourself again--- for me? The real you?&quot;

For long seconds Mirra says nothing, but finally she reluctantly changes
her form back to the original Mirror form. As she laid there, looking so
sad, Hikaru couldn&#39;t help but reach out to touch Mirra&#39; face and whisper
&quot;Your beautiful, Mirra-chan.&quot;

Mirra - &quot;---I am?&quot;

&quot;You are.&quot; (Hikaru sticks a bit of pancake into Mirra&#39;s mouth) &quot;Now eat
your fill and let&#39;s get started with your studies! Oh, I asked and
Umi-papa said I could stay over until you were back on your feet.&quot;

Mirra - &quot;Like a sleepover?&quot;

&quot;More like a loving nurse taking care of her favorite patient!&quot; Hikaru
chided, feeding Mirra another piece of pancake. &quot;And if you behave we&#39;ll
share a bath!&quot;

&quot;HIKARU!!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll wear a bathing suit! Don&#39;t worry!&quot; (smiles) &quot;Your serious about
saving our virginity until we&#39;re ready, aren&#39;t you little Mirra!&quot;

Mirra-chan nods her head meekly. &quot;Like Tomoyo-mama &amp; Sakura-papa. When we
make love for the first time I want it to be every bit as special as
their first time.&quot;

Hikaru nods her head, &quot;That&#39;s OK with me. Though we&#39;re dreams right?
We&#39;re not completely flesh and blood--- maybe we can speed the process up
and be 16 tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

The two talk about it over breakfast, letting the subject sit for the
time being as they start on Mirra&#39;s studies. Still, it&#39;ll be a topic
that&#39;ll return one day---

* * * * * *

&quot;Chocolate cheesecake? Now there&#39;s a new recipe I never saw Sakura help
make before!&quot;

&quot;Is ie edible?&quot; Nina asks suspiciously as Eliza belts her one in the arm
softly, &quot;I&#39;m complimenting the two on their creation. Don&#39;t be a
killjoy.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, sorry.&quot; (Nina mutters, looking at cake again) &quot;Can we have some?&quot;

&quot;Yes, there&#39;s plenty.&quot; Tomoyo assures the green haired girl, slicing
pieces as she does.

&quot;I WANT SOME TOO!!&quot;

&quot;You too, Kero. You too.&quot;

Nina suddenly becomes serious, &quot;I did some checking. There&#39;s some notes
in the multi dimensional archives about Mirror training under Mimic when
Clow Reed created the Mirror card. May go a long way to explaining her
hatred for Mirror now.&quot;

&quot;So they&#39;re teacher &amp; pupil?&quot;

Nina - &quot;Not so much that, Sakura, as they&#39;re different versions of each
other. Mimic being the first and teaching Mirror to be her replacement.
Mirra also told me what Mimic accused her of, reluctantly at that mind
you.&quot;

&quot;You mean about her stealing Clow Reed from Mimic?&quot; Tomoyo asked.

&quot;Yeah (nice to see she tells you just about everything), that. I can&#39;t
believe innocent little Mirra could even be accused of such a thing.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s from the dementia?&quot; Kero remarks offhandedly, &quot;Mimic isn&#39;t
exactly playing with a full deck of cards, you know.&quot;

&quot;Sure, Kero, but there must be some reason she accused Mirra of stealing
Clow Reed from her. Hell, there must be a reason Mimic&#39;s dead set on
thinking she and Clow Reed were an item to begin with!&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter why Mimic did it.&quot; Sakura began, her resolve set and
locked, &quot;I&#39;m going to stop her once and for all, and do my best to
capture all the cards and change them once again back into Star cards.
Stop the madness before it gets worst. So that there&#39;s no more

suffering like Mirra-chan.&quot; (frowns) &quot;Rebecca is right, we can&#39;t let
anyone suffer because of the cards. Not anyone.&quot;

&quot;Your going to do it!&quot; Kero chips in, &quot;You did it before, and you&#39;ll do
it again. Don&#39;t let pouty faced grumblers like Rebecca get you down!&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a war jingle.&quot; Nina notes.

Kero - &quot;Hey! This is a war! And Sakura&#39;s going to roll over that witch
Mimic like a Sherman tank, believe you me! Mimic&#39;s going to wish she
never crossed Sakura Kinomoto, Mistress of the Cards!!&quot; (drools) &quot;Is the
dessert ready? I&#39;m starved!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ready.&quot; (Tomoyo finishes the settings and motions to the door)
&quot;Let&#39;s take these to Mirra&#39;s room, then we&#39;ll eat ours in Sakura&#39;s room.&quot;

Nina sighs as she moves to open the door, her thoughts echoing in her
head as she does.

&#39;Looks like Keiko was right on the money. She can do it! Save us all and
capture the cards again.&#39;

&quot;Nina! We&#39;re going to my room!&quot;

Nina suddenly realizes she&#39;s been left holding the door.

&quot;I know! I know! Sheesh! Don&#39;t start with---&quot; (door closes behind her)

&quot;Now we&#39;re even.&quot; (Mimic)

* * * * * *

Mirra shivered as she rolled over in bed, feeling abit awkward for some
reason.

Something felt wrong and she didn&#39;t know why.

Suddenly the door to the huge walk in closet opens and out steps Mimic.

&quot;There. That makes us even now.&quot;

With a slight gasp Mirra jumps out of bed, running to the closet. As she
reaches the door she nearly trips over Hikaru&#39;s pajama top, her foot
feeling a slight puddle of wetness as she beholds---

Mirra wakes up screaming.

&quot;It&#39;s alright! It&#39;s OK! Mirra-chan! Mirra-chan!!&quot;

It takes a few seconds for Mirra to register Hikaru&#39;s presence, her
strong arms wrapped around her holding her tight. &quot;I&#39;m here--- I&#39;m
here--- please Mirra-chan--- I&#39;m here---&quot;

Mirra collapses into Hikaru, her head against the other girl&#39;s strong
shoulders as she cries.

Three nights. For three nights Mirra has been plagued by dark tormenting
visions.

Unshakable images of Hikaru being brutally raped by Mimic.

As Hikaru rocked Mirra in her arms, she comes to a conclusion.

* * * * * *

Three days has passed since the incident with Mimic.

Tomoyo left one day ago on a business trip concerning her anime company,
but she kept in touch with Sakura using a long distance holo-system Nina
helped her install in her hotel room to link to the holochamber beneath
the house so she could spend time with Sakura even

over a long distance.

Sakura, for her part, moved into the holochamber downstairs and slept
there so she could be with Tomoyo during the time they were in contact,
which was nearly a day apart by waking terminology.

As for Mirra &amp; Hikaru?

&quot;Your moving in?&quot; Mirra asked puzzled, &quot;But I&#39;ll be better in a day or
two.&quot;

&quot;I want to.&quot; (Hikaru reaches out and touches Mirra&#39;s face) &quot;I can&#39;t stand
it, knowing your suffering because of me. I want to be here to chase your
nightmares away--- my love.&quot;

&quot;---I don&#39;t deserve you sometimes---&quot; Mirra sighs painfully, looking as
if she felt ashamed.

&quot;Don&#39;t do that. I don&#39;t like it when you pout. Now smile---&quot; (Hikaru
pokes at Mirra&#39;s cheeks bringing out a smile) &quot;That&#39;s one of your best
traits----&quot; (pauses) &quot;----and thank you.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; Mirra asked.

&quot;For spending time with me in your true form. For letting me get to know
you better as yourself.&quot; (passes a hand through Mirra&#39;s long hair)
&quot;You&#39;re a very beautiful young woman, Mirra-chan, like a pretty china
doll.&quot;

&quot;Hikaru-chan.&quot;

&quot;Well---&quot; (Hikaru kisses Mirra softly on the lips) &quot;---I have to go to
school. I&#39;ll be home later with your studywork so get your rest.&quot;

Mirra - &quot;I will. And thank you.&quot;

Hikaru - &quot;For what?&quot;

Mirra - &quot;For putting up with my childish-ness. You shouldn&#39;t have to---&quot;

&quot;Shh---&quot; (Hikaru places two fingers on Mirra&#39;s lips) &quot;---that&#39;s what
lovers are for.&quot; (steals one more kiss) &quot;See you later.&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot;

As the door closes Mirra leans back on her pillow, touching her lips. &quot;My
precious---&quot;

Kero - &quot;Is she gone?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s gone, Kerberos.&quot;

&quot;YA-HOO!&quot; (flies out from hiding spot) &quot;I asked Light to help me put you
on the couch so we can play video games! Yeah! Another day of movie
theater screen sized video game fun! Al---&quot;

Door opens, Kero quickly freezing up to do his stuffed animal act as
Hikaru pokes her head back into the room. &quot;Oh, and Mirra-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

Hikaru - &quot;Tell Kero he can&#39;t monopolize your time all day because you
have studies to do when I get back home, alright? And my parents are
dropping off some luggage for me so please let me unpack them. OK?&quot;

Mirra - &quot;OK.&quot;

Hikaru leaves the room again.

Mirra - &quot;Hikaru said not to monopolize my---&quot;

Kero - &quot;I heard! I heard! Sheesh---&quot; (slumps) &quot;---you told her about me,
right?&quot;

Mirra - &quot;Lovers don&#39;t keep secrets from each other.&quot;

Kero - &quot;---oh, right---&quot; (sighs) &quot;---I&#39;ll get the game warmed up while we
wait for Light---&quot;

* * * * * *

Meanwhile, in Holochamber 00 (beneath the house)

&quot;I&#39;M LATE!!&quot; Sakura tumbles through and over Eliza, dressing and prepping
so frantically that it knocks the older woman onto her back as Sakura
blows past her. Around them was a sim of Sakura &amp; Tomoyo&#39;s bedroom where
Sakura slept only a few hours ago in the arms of

&quot;Tomoyo&quot; (or her holographic counterpart as the real Tomoyo held &quot;Sakura&quot;
in realtime across the ocean in her own holo-suite, both &quot;holding&quot; the
other though a long distance separated the two lovers.)

&quot;Now that&#39;ll leave a mark---&quot; Eliza sighs as she stares up at the
ceiling, &quot;---I did try to wake you up, Sakura, several times as a matter
of fact.&quot;

&quot;STOP REMINDING ME!!! (Even the holographic bed felt too good to want to
wake up from!!)&quot;

Eliza - &quot;Maybe we should put a pea under it or something. Anyway, you
better hurry or you&#39;ll miss going to school with Mirra&#39;s girlfriend
Haruka, and---&quot;

Sakura - &quot;THAT&#39;S HIKARU!!!&quot;

&quot;----&quot; Eliza, frozen in place, stared on shellshocked as Sakura runs
straight into the holochamber doors (not remembering that the doors take
a few seconds to hiss open) before she scurries out and up the stairs to
ground floor. &quot;She scares me---&quot; she finally manages to whisper.

In the kitchen, Nina finishes plating Sakura&#39;s breakfast as she comes
barreling into the room.

&quot;WAHHH!! I&#39;M LATE!! I&#39;M LATE!! WHERE&#39;S---&quot; (sees Hikaru aleady eating
breakfast) &quot;--oh.&quot;

&quot;Your ALWAYS late, Snoozer.&quot; Nina remarks glumly as she sets Sakura&#39;s
food down, &quot;Tell me of a time when your NOT oversleeping.&quot;

&quot;Morning, Sakura-chan.&quot; (Sonomi smiles as she regards Sakura)

&quot;Morning!&quot; (her grumpy &quot;I hate Nina&quot; face dissolving back into her
usually cheery demeanor).

Sonomi - &quot;Better hurry or you&#39;ll be late. Tomoyo might not be here but
she wanted me to make sure you got to school ontime each day she was
away.&quot;

Sakura nods her head quickly as she shoves her food down.

&quot;I&#39;m off. Come on, Eliza! We&#39;re going!&quot; (looks at Hikaru) &quot;Ready?&quot;

&quot;Ready. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Shanks for sha fud!&quot;

Sonomi - &quot;But Nina made it, not---&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Sya u liter!&quot;

&quot;---me---&quot; (Sonomi shakes her head) &quot;---goodbye?&quot;

Sonomi looks around the silent kitchen and sighs. &quot;How did she ever
manage to get to school on time while she lived with HIM--- sigh.&quot;
(Sonomi eats another bite of her food) &quot;Tomoyo&#39;s a certified miracle
worker to get Sakura out of bed every morning.&quot;
