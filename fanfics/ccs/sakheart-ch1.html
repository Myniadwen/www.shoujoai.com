<pre>Sometimes I sit on a bench in our garden&#133;

Syaoran&#146;s and mine, I mean.

I have a hard time thinking it&#146;s not yours, Tomoyo-chan.

All the flowers I chose are just like those you had&#133;

I wonder where you went?

You faded away after I came here, so far away from you.

Syaoran says not to worry, and that you&#146;re fine.

But&#133;What would my Tomoyo-chan do if I&#146;m so far away?

It seemed that I was your whole life when we were little.

Are you okay Tomoyo-chan?

Are you okay?

So often now my heart feels like it will break.

Onii-chan said that I needed to look back and understand your secret.

What secret, Tomoyo-chan?

What did you keep from me?

What could mean so much to you that you&#146;d fade away because of it?

I had a dream last night, and the night before it, and the night 
before 

that.

Remember the race where I caught the Flower?

We were there&#133;the words you said to me then played over again and 

again.

&#145;You don&#146;t know just how much I love you, Sakura-chan.&#146;

Tomoyo-chan&#133;

I feel as if all my light is gone&#133;my world is dark.

You always made me smile, and blush, and feel loved.

You say you have no magic&#133;

Then why do you make me feel like you know a magic I don&#146;t?

I miss you Tomoyo-chan.

Were you my light?

Syaoran says not.

But then why was I happy until you were gone?

Until Syaoran insisted on moving here?

Tomoyo-chan, even though my mind is still wishing you would explain 
all 

of this to me, my heart says I already know what you would say.

&#145;I love you Sakura-chan.&#146;

&#145;There is nothing more interesting or pretty as Sakura-chan!&#146;

&#145;You&#146;re so sweet Sakura-chan.&#146;

&#145;Because I like you Sakura.&#146;

Everything you&#146;ve every said to me goes through my mind everyday, and 

through my heart.

I miss you Tomoyo-chan.

I love you Tomoyo-chan.
