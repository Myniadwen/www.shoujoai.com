<h1>I Win!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chibidragon.html">Chibidragon</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This story, like so many other stories begins from Hong Kong, a 
thriving port in the south china sea, a meeting place of east and 
west, place where they make action movies with high flying people and 
low comedy. A city where university tuition fee is almost 6000 US$ per 
year (damn!). 

A young girl of twelve or so was packing her suitcase. She was fairly 
pretty in a cute sort of way, long black hair tied with red ribbons to 
two balls on side of her head. She was singing by her self in a low 
voice &quot;Up in blue sky silly blimp go by... Where it come from? Where 
it going? Ziggy-zaggy it fly high.&quot; 

Her singing was cut by arrival of a nervous looking boy, he was about 
the same age as she was with short brown hair and brown eyes. &quot;Hi, 
Meiling-chan, umm, we are going to japan for a few days and I was 
wondering if...&quot; His nervous stutter was interrupted by the girl. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Li-kun, Kinomoto-san really likes you, although she is an 
oyayan so she probably can&#39;t say it straight to you, but...&quot; She spun 
around to face the boy &quot;in that manner she is much like you, I think 
you two deserve each other&quot; 

Li-kun wasn&#39;t sure about Meiling&#39;s smile, it made him kind of a 
nervous. Closest analogy would be some psycopathic killer on rampage.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Next morning Tomoyo was waiting in Narinata airport for a flight from 
Hong Kong. The plane was little late and she was afraid that her 
little surprise for Sakura wouldn&#39;t work. She was relieved when she 
saw the JAL jumbo jet to touch down and lumber towards the boarding 
corridor, and before long two familiar figures came through the 
customs. 

&quot;Hello Tomoyo&quot; Meiling said and hugged her friend. 

&quot;Hello Daidouji-san&quot; Said Shaoran, who seemed to have something else 
on his mind. Meiling took Tomoyo&#39;s hand and they started to walk down 
the corridor. A few bodyguards appeared seemingly out of nowhere as 
Tomoyo made a small wave with her free hand and took Shaoran&#39;s and 
Meiling&#39;s luggage with them. 

&quot;I will be going to this new amusement park with Sakura today&quot; Tomoyo 
said to Meiling &quot;We will drop you off there, take your luggage to my 
place and then I will go get Sakura. Then we can stage an surprise 
meeting down at the park&quot;. 

&quot;That sounds like a good plan&quot; Meiling said. 

&quot;Yes, a chance encounter in a amusement park, young and shy girl meets 
the boy she was destined to be with&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s eyes had turned to stars 
as she fantasized about the coming meeting and some part of her mind 
was analyzing probable camera angles for the shoujo story that could 
be made about it. Meiling sweatdropped, looked at Tomoyo, then turned 
her head towards Shaoran who was still probably thinking about 
Kinomoto-san, she turned her face back towards Tomoyo who was still 
rambling about undying love and destiny. 

She took Tomoyo&#39;s chin in her hand and turned her face towards hers 
&quot;Remember, Kinomoto-san and Shaoran-kun will get to together, and you 
are...&quot; Her sentence was cut half because Shaoran hadn&#39;t noticed that 
they had stopped and he bumped straight in to them 

&quot;Ouch, oh sorry, I didn&#39;t notice that you stopped... I was thinking&quot; 
He apologized. But it was too late, the spell had been broken and the 
princes ran away 

&quot;Oh my, now we must hurry so we can get to the park in time&quot; Tomoyo 
said and rushed off. Meiling entertained the idea of doing something 
extremely violent to Shaoran but decided against it because this is a 
children&#39;s story.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Tomoyo left them in the amusement park and continued to the 
Kinomoto-residence to get her friend, Sakura. They took off to the 
amusement park and met with Shaoran and Meiling, as the plan went. A 
bit later they were walking towards home when they walked past 
Sakura&#39;s home 

&quot;Well, we&#39;ll be off now&quot; Meiling said and started to walk off with 
Tomoyo, &quot;Have fun you two&quot; she added to the general direction of 
Sakura and Shaoran. 

&quot;Do you think they will be okay?&quot; Tomoyo asked with small concern. 

&quot;No, they won&#39;t, they are both too slow to realize their feelings 
unless we give them little push towards the right direction. And if 
that doesn&#39;t help well have to give them a bigger push!&quot; Meiling 
answered with a burning determination. 

&quot;Oh Meiling-chan, your concern for your friends is so wonderful&quot; 
Tomoyo said and took Meiling&#39;s hand between hers. 

Meiling turned her face towards the other girl and said &quot;As is yours.&quot;

Tomoyo grabbed Meiling&#39;s necktie &quot;I would rather be something more to 
you than a friend&quot; Tomoyo whispered as she leaned closer to the 
chinese girl. 

&quot;I wish that too&quot; Meiling said and closed he eyes. At that precise 
moment a large group of elder people on their way to the local 
pachinko parlor turned around the corner and saw the two girls. 

&quot;Look, what are they doing&quot; 

&quot;Oh no&quot;

&quot;They are both girls&quot; 

&quot;kids these days&quot; 

&quot;Not in my youth&quot; 

Shouts ringed in four red ears that were retreating at fast pace from 
the scene.

------------------------------------------------------------------

After Tomoyo and Meiling managed to escape from Pensioner&#39;s Pachinko 
Club (PPC for short) Tomoyo called her bodyguards to come and pick the 
two girls up. After a short ride they were back in Daidouji mansion 
where Tomoyo lived with her mother, their maid and six bodyguards. It 
had been a hot day so a bath seemed like a good choice for that 
moment. As they sat in the furo they talked about their plan to get 
Sakura and Shaoran together 

&quot;Our class will be making a play for the Nadeshiko festivals, Naoko 
has written it and most of the casting is done. But I have talked to 
Naoko and I think we can arrange it so that Shaoran-san will play the 
role of the prince&quot; Tomoyo explained to her friend. 

&quot;And Kinomoto-san is playing the Princess?&quot; Meiling asked, before 
Tomoyo had time to answer Meiling continued &quot;Shame, I think 
Kinomoto-san made a very good prince last time we did a play&quot; 

&quot;And Shaoran-san made a very cute princess&quot; Tomoyo said and giggled. 

&quot;Oh, yes. Shaoran did make a good princess, but now I have much 
prettier princess&quot; Meiling said and put her arms around Tomoyo&#39;s neck. 
The hot bath had made their head&#39;s light and Tomoyo was ready to melt 
in Meiling&#39;s strong but yet soft arms. Just as Meiling was about to 
kiss Tomoyo the door crashed open and Sonomi, Tomoyo&#39;s mother stood 
there clad in a towel. 

&quot;Hi Tomoyo-chan. I heard that we have guests&quot; Sonomi looked at very 
red Meiling who was at the other end of the bathtub. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
interrupt anything did I?&quot; Sonomi asked with false innocence in her 
voice. She walked to the edge of the tub and kneeled in front of her 
daughter &quot;So, are you just cheating on Sakura or are you really going 
to change over to her&quot; she said, and looked at Meiling. &quot;Oh well, she 
is cute and all&quot; Sonomi started to smile and before Meiling could 
react she jumped in to the bath and gave Meiling a big bear hug. 
&quot;Welcome to the family, be good to my little girl&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------

Next day they went to the amusement park, Tomoyo and Meiling continued 
their mission to get Sakura and Shaoran together. 

&quot;Have they even kissed yet&quot; Meiling as she watched the couple. &quot;I know 
that they both are little slow but this is too much!&quot; 

&quot;Just give them some time together, it will turn good sooner or later. 
If not here at park, maybe in the play&quot; Tomoyo replied

&quot;Are you sure you can get Shaoran-kun to play the part of the prince&quot; 
Meiling asked with her hands on her hips. 

&quot;Yes, I have spoken with Naoko-chan and Yamazaki-kun and they have 
both agreed upon it.&quot; Meiling seemed to be content with the answer, 
she looked around and seemed to come with an idea 

&quot;I know, let&#39;s take them to the ferris wheel, that would be a perfect 
stage for the first kiss!&quot; 

Before long all four were on the wheel, Sakura and Shaoran had their 
own box while Tomoyo and Meiling were in the next. As the ride started 
Tomoyo readied her camera and began filming. They couldn&#39;t see in yet 
because they were higher but as soon as they reached the top they got 
a good view to the next car. 

&quot;How does it go?&quot; Meiling inquired. 

&quot;They are still on the opposite sides looking at the floor, but Sakura 
seems to be pretty red&quot; Tomoyo gave the answer 

&quot;Sakura expressed her feeling&quot; Meiling noted as she watched the scene 
in the other car. Tomoyo on the other hand was so focused on her 
filming that she didn&#39;t notice how Meiling dove under her arms and 
came up in front of her.  &quot;Let&#39;s not care about them for a moment.&quot; 
She said as she placed her index finger on Tomoyo&#39;s lips. &quot;Let&#39;s just 
concentrate on us&quot; She put her hands around the other girl and 
prepared to kiss when Tomoyo interrupted her

&quot;Umm... Meiling, I think the ride is about to end&quot;. The wheel stopped 
and the door opened, it could be seen that Meiling was angry as she 
walked out.

&quot;Oh well, I&#39;ll get a chance yet&quot; she said to her self &quot;She will be 
mine, oh yes, she will be mine&quot; (insert a high pitched laughter -tm 
here)

------------------------------------------------------------------

Festivals began a few days later, and as was noted before Sakura and 
her class were preparing for a play. 

&quot;Did you plan Yamazaki-kun&#39;s accident beforehand?&quot; Meiling asked 
Tomoyo as she was readying for her own number. 

&quot;No, it was a fortunate accident, but the fact that he choose Shaoran 
was planned at least&quot; Tomoyo replied as she applied makeup for the 
stage. 

&quot;They even had a small part for me&quot; Meiling said as Tomoyo walked 
towards the stage. Meiling took Tomoyo&#39;s hand and moved closer. Just 
as she was about to kiss announcer announced Tomoyo and she had to 
hurry to stage.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The play started and everything was going fine until things got 
romantic, witch was precisely the moment when the card struck. It was 
a new card, sealed by Clow Reeds for it was too dangerous. It managed 
to erase most of the people in the park, and only Sakura, Shaoran, 
Tomoyo and Meiling were left.

They had managed to evacuate themselves at the top of a nearby 
building and were discussing about their strategy. Tomoyo had just 
given an uniform for Sakura and Shaoran when the card stuck again. it 
happened too fast to allow Tomoyo or Meiling to react...

------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun was rising when they regained consciousness, they were on the top 
of the building where they were when the card had got them. Meiling 
watched as Tomoyo was getting up and when she saw that the two of them 
were alone she grabbed Tomoyo and kissed her fully on the mouth. 
Slowly she broke the kiss and smiled. 

&quot;I love you Tomoyo&quot; she said. 

&quot;I love you too Meiling, I wish we could be together forever...&quot; 

Tomoyo was cut off by loud screams of surprise and pain. 

&quot;It came from amusement park, let&#39;s go&quot; She said and started to run 
towards the sounds with Meiling. 

As they arrived at the base of a clock tower that was at the center of 
the park they found Sakura and Shaoran in a one big heap at the bottom 
of the stairs. 

&quot;What happened, are you all right?&quot; Tomoyo asked. 

&quot;Uuuuh... I was going to jump in Shaoran&#39;s arms but he slipped 
backwards and we rolled all the way down the stairs&quot; said Sakura while 
Shaoran just concentrated to moaning in pain and trying not to writhe 
because writhing hurt so much. 

Meiling looked at the scene, smiled at the two heroes and said &quot;I 
think that you two really deserve each other. Oh well, have fun.&quot; then 
she looked at Tomoyo and then back at Sakura, flashed a V sign and 
said &quot;I win&quot;
