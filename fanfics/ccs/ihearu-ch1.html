<pre>&#147;Sakura!&#148; That voice, the same one that haunts my dreams calls my 
name. It&#146;s owner runs towards me, her dark hair blowing behind her.

&#147;Wait up!&#148; I have an angel running towards me, and god do I wait for 
her. In fact, I even met her halfway.

She smiles, of course. She always does that. &#147;Did you expect me to let 
you walk to school alone?&#148;

&#147;I guess not, sorry Tomoyo-chan, I was lost in thought&#148; I said.

&#147;Oh, it&#146;s okay. I know you must be really upset about Syaoran&#148; I had 
received a letter from him months ago, telling me he was marrying 
Meiling. Actually, I hadn&#146;t been slightly upset at the news.

We walked to school alone now. Touya and Yuki had finished school and 
lived together. That had upset me a little. But most of all it was my 
feelings for Tomoyo and the dreams I had of her that made me so 
absent-minded. We had known each other for four years, almost five, so 
at first I thought it was just platonic love, but it wasn&#146;t. I don&#146;t 
think she could love me back. She still thought I loved Syaoran. If 
only she knew it was she I wanted so badly. The one I wanted to hold 
in my arms until I died. I was dying, and she didn&#146;t know the real 
reason why.

&#145;She deserves to know&#146; that&#146;s what Kero said, and I knew he was right. 
But the chance of losing her friendship was unbearable and I couldn&#146;t 
take a chance with Tomoyo-chan.

                                                                   ***

&#147;Did you tell Tomoyo?&#148; Kero asked me. I shook my head and continued to 
write in my journal. Or scribble at least, and pretend I was writing. 
My vision blurred as tears fell down my face and stained the paper. 
Kero watched me, he saw me do this every night and never knew really 
what to do.

&#147;Maybe you should ask Tomoyo to stay over at your house tonight?&#148; Kero 
suggested &#147;I think her company would ease some of the pain&#148;

I nodded and pulled a pink cell phone from the dresser drawer and 
dialed the number I had punched in about a billion times. 

Ring&#133;

&#147;Hello?&#148;

&#147;Tomoyo!!&#148;
&#147;Oh, hi Sakura!&#148;

&#147;Hi! Would you stay over at my house tonight?&#148;

&#147;Sure! Let me get my stuff and I&#146;ll be right over,&#148; I could tell she 
was smiling.

About an hour later I was dragging Tomoyo upstairs.  I was so glad to 
see her, knowing she was going to stay.

                                                            ***

Later that night, we changed into our pajamas and lied down in the 
bed. I watched Tomoyo looking out the window, a pained expression on 
her face. I knew that look. It was the same way I looked when I 
thought about how small the chances were of me and Tomoyo as a couple. 
I took her into my arms, trying to comfort her.

&#147;Who is it?&#148; I whispered, I rested my chin on the top of her head.

She made no reply. It was okay I could wait. I could hear her heart 
beating, and her soul calling out to me. Her eyes were like pieces of 
the sea. She was so damn gorgeous.

&#147;Tomoyo&#133;&#148; I whispered involuntarily. She looked up at me. I was a bit 
taller than her, but she was a pretty good height herself. I ran my 
hand down her side and felt the curves of her body. Before I could 
realize what I was doing I kissed her. I had never kissed anyone, but 
somehow, I just knew how to kiss her. I let out all the pent-up 
feelings and passion I had tried to keep hidden for too long, only to 
fail like this. What would she do when we parted? Would she be mad or 
grossed out?

All these worries were washed away when she put her arms around my 
neck and started to kiss me back. I had to do something. I wanted to 
prove to her I loved her. How much I loved her. My hands slid down a 
little lower and I started to pull her pajama bottoms down. I pulled 
them as low as I could without breaking the kiss, and she kicked them 
off the rest of the way. I lowered myself and she whimpered when I 
broke the kiss. I ran my hands through her hair until I reached the 
ends and continued to move under the covers until I was at level with 
her middle. I slid down her panties and put her legs over my 
shoulders. She gasped as I slid my tongue inside of her, and sighed 
when I slid it in and out of her.  She wriggled and squirmed, not 
being able to stay still because of the pleasure, at least that&#146;s what 
I hoped. I pulled my tongue out and began to suckle on her clit. She 
squirmed even more, and even cried out. I wanted to make her scream, 
the house was empty, so there would be nobody to question what was 
going on. She began breathing harder and harder until finally she 
screamed my name, filling the empty halls. I lapped up every drop 
before sliding her clothes back up and joining her up at the pillow. I 
stopped to look at her then kissed her passionately. 

&#147;I love you, Tomoyo&#148;

&#147;I love you, too Sakura&#148;

Those were the magic words I had dreamt about. I watched her doze off 
and then felt my own need. The tingling from in between my legs. I 
wish she would have me, or I would have myself. Suddenly, I felt her 
hand slip into my pajama bottoms and her finger slid into me, she 
pumped it in and out while rubbing my clit and it wasn&#146;t long before I 
came. I kissed her once more before we both feel asleep, with her in 
my arms. I could hear her breathing, her heartbeat, her soul, and her 
mind, all screaming my name. I love you, Tomoyo.

&#147;I love you, too Sakura-sama&#148; 

I jerked awake and smiled at the half-sleeping angel in my arms. Until 
we fell asleep for real this time.

The End!

There we go! All done! I don&#146;t own these characters, I don&#146;t own this, 
I don&#146;t own that. There ya go.
