<h1>Miss Witch (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/forever3330.html">Forever3330</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/misswitch-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>	Megumi appears, reading a manga. A sign immediately falls on her 
head, reading &#145;HELLO! I LET YOU DO THIS, SO DO IT!&#146;
	&#147;Owww! I&#146;m going, I&#146;m going!&#148; The book disappears. Megumi bows 
towards the reader. &#147;Uh, sorry, didn&#146;t see you there. Last time, in 
&#145;Chapter One: Chosen&#146;, the youngest member of the Daidouji clan was 
chosen for the position of Guardian Witch at the Council of Five 
Moons. Wonder what she&#146;s doing this time? And what about the other 
four who get to leave their homes&#133;?&#148; Megumi shrugs, then snaps her 
fingers, a scene appearing behind her as she is erased from it&#133;
~
	There are many types of silence. Take the kind of silence that 
usually envelops a classroom; that silence is a mixture. Some students 
listening respectfully, but most half-lost in their own world. Miss 
Young&#146;s class, now in the eighth grade, seems to be within that type 
of silence now.
	A brunette in a seat by the window is bent over her notebook, 
erasing something furiously. Sitting up straight she looks down at the 
page with a frown. &#147;Come on&#133;&#148; She whispers. Sighing, she closes the 
notebook, giving up on drawing her teacher. Miss Young was just too 
hard to draw&#133;The girl turns to look out the window beside her, sighing 
again.
	&#147;Hey, Sakura-chan!&#148; Rika pokes the girl in front of her with a 
pencil, trying to get Sakura to pay attention to her.
	&#147;Huh? Nani, Rika-chan?&#148; Sakura half-turns and raises an eyebrow, 
noting that Miss Young is lost in reading the current English book to 
the class. She was, after all, the English teacher. Sakura found the 
language easy enough, but didn&#146;t speak in it. She loved Japanese more 
then the other language, and never really saw the point in using 
English when most of the other students couldn&#146;t get the hang of it as 
well as she had.
	&#147;Pay attention to Miss Young! It&#146;s getting really good.&#148; The 
other girl replied, nodding her head in the teacher&#146;s direction.
	Sakura sighed and looked to the front of the classroom again. 
From what she had actually listened to, she gathered that the book was 
another romance. Why wouldn&#146;t they get a good, realistic book once? 
It&#146;d be nice.
	Though she had a boyfriend of her own, Kinomoto Sakura didn&#146;t 
get why books and people and songs always went on about love. She 
really didn&#146;t understand what was so wonderful about it. Love was 
love. Right?
	Deciding to ignore the story again, Sakura sighed, and changed 
her thoughts to more interesting subjects, ones that she could find 
answers to. Lately Kero had been worried about something or the other. 
He said someone was supposed to have shown up a long time ago, when 
she first opened the book. Now that she had had all the cards for a 
few years she didn&#146;t think they would show up, though Kero had said 
they had to. Yue had added something about Witch magic being 
unreliable when he had made one of his rare appearances at a meeting. 
He usually stayed in Yuki&#146;s form, letting the human part of him live 
out his life blissfully unaware of the magical creature within him.
	Sakura lay her head on her desk. &#147;But those dreams&#133;&#148; She 
whispered to herself. For the past five days she had been having the 
strangest dreams&#133;they took place in a forest, with her walking around. 
She had only noted that it seemed to be a forest of Sakura trees in 
full bloom. It was almost like a festival&#133;She was in a kimono, all 
ready and excited. But about what?
	Then the figure in the dark blue kimono could be seen, someone 
grabbing her arm&#133;someone evil&#133;then, just as the girl was turning her 
head, the dream stopped, only allowing her to hear her name be called 
out, and then wake.
	Sakura wanted to see the girl&#146;s face. She knew it was a girl 
only because of all that hair&#133;but still&#133;Sakura wiped it from her 
memory, silently shoving it in the farthest corner of her mind, before 
she again began sketching Miss Young.
~
	Tomoyo smiled at her two guards as she reached the doors of the 
Principal&#146;s Office. &#147;Suzuhara-san, Mako-san, arigatou for taking me 
this far. But I had better do the rest, daijoubu?&#148;
	The two women bowed. &#147;As you wish Chibi-Daidouji-san.&#148; They said 
together. 
	&#147;And be sure to call us if you need a ride or something! You 
know Daidouji-san would kill us if you got hurt.&#148; Suzuhara added. She 
smiled, one of the only guards who ever did.
	&#147;Chibi-Daidouji-san?&#148; Tomoyo lifted an eyebrow, smiling.
	&#147;Consider it a nickname!&#148; Suzuhara explained. &#147;We have to have 
one for you, since you are our charge now. When we&#146;re not with you we 
go back to the house or have off time.&#148; She always was the talkative 
one&#133;
	&#147;Suzie-chan, be quiet! Let Chibi-Daidouji-san go inside. We 
mustn&#146;t let her be any later!&#148; Mako dragged the blonde guard away, 
sweatdropping.
	Tomoyo giggled, gently opening the door to the office, before 
being knocked over  by a woman who was racing out of the office. The 
older woman pulled Tomoyo to her feet and started running with Tomoyo 
in tow.
	&#147;Ah! Ournewstudentoftheday, DaidoujiTomoyo, correct? Good! 
I&#146;mMissMisaki! I&#146;massistantprincipal, 
andMr.Yuri-Bijouhappenstobebusyrightnow, soI&#146;mdroppingyou 
offatMissYoung&#146;sclass! Oh, here&#146;syourschedule!&#148; While still racing 
down the hallway with Tomoyo flying off the ground and being pulled 
along by sheer force, Miss Misaki stuffed a paper into one of Tomoyo&#146;s 
books.
	Suddenly they came to a screeching halt, and Miss Misaki opened 
a door and shoved Tomoyo in, only taking the time to shout, 
&#147;MissYoungIgotyouanewstudent ByeIgottarun!&#148; Miss Misaki ran off, 
slamming the door behind her, and leaving a sweatdropping Tomoyo 
behind.
~
	A few students giggled as Miss Young sweatdropped and looked at 
the way Miss Misaki had come, frozen, right after Miss Misaki had sped 
by. As always, the assistant principal was having her usual fast-paced 
day. Very fast-paced.
	Sakura looked up at the new student, and almost smiled, before 
stopping herself. She didn&#146;t even know this girl!
	The girl was standing just in front of the door, a little to the 
side of Miss Young. She looked a bit confused, surprised, and 
disheveled. After being brought to class by Miss Misaki that was 
understandable.
	The girl&#146;s stormy blue eyes were wide, and she brought her free 
hand up to her mouth, looking a little dizzy. Sakura blinked, noticing 
the new girl had very pale skin. Lavender hair seemed to tumble down 
to just below her waist, held back only by a white headband. She wore 
the same uniform as every other girl did, a sailor one much like what 
Sakura had worn in the fifth grade, but without a hat. Sakura stared 
at the girl&#146;s hands for a few moments, noting every detail. She wished 
she could draw them, but she could barely draw Kero-chan. She just 
wasn&#146;t an artist. But it kept her busy during class&#133;
	&#147;Ohayo.&#148; A musical voice finally broke the silence, sounding 
calm and clear, but soft. &#147;I&#146;m Daidouji Tomoyo. I&#146;m afraid Miss Misaki 
forgot to mention what class you teach Miss Young. Could you please 
tell me what I am in?&#148;
	Sakura looked up from the slender hands in surprise, looking for 
the source of the voice. Her eyes rested on the new girl. Blinking, 
Sakura blushed, finally noticing that she was staring.
	Miss Young seemed petrified still, from Miss Misaki, and 
blinked, shaking her head. &#147;Oh! I&#146;m sorry dear. You&#146;re in English 
class, Tomoyo. Why don&#146;t you find a seat?&#148;
	A few people waved to Tomoyo, hoping the new girl would sit by 
them. Quite a few boys made up most of those who did this. Sakura 
suddenly noticed that she was raising her hand as well, and quickly 
withdrew it.
	Sakura heard someone stop beside her desk, and looked up to see 
Tomoyo. She felt her face warm, but smiled brightly, feeling 
unreasonably happy.
	Tomoyo began to go through her belongings, searching for 
something, then sighing. As Miss Young continued the story Sakura 
reached her hand out across the narrow aisle. Then she whispered, 
&#147;Ohayo. I&#146;m Kinomoto Sakura. Would you like a pencil?&#148; 
	Tomoyo&#146;s face brightened, and she flashed a smile that made 
Sakura&#146;s stomach flop. &#147;Ohayo! I&#146;m Daidouji Tomoyo, and that would be 
wonderful! I think I dropped mine when Miss Misaki showed me here.&#148; 
Tomoyo whispered back, strands of lavender falling across her face as 
she leaned over. Gently, she placed her hand in Sakura&#146;s and slightly 
shook it before taking the pencil from her.
	Sakura giggled, barely noticing that she had given Tomoyo her 
favorite pencil, a mechanical one that was pink, with a heart with 
wings on the end. &#147;You mean the Misaki Express?&#148;
	Tomoyo smiled. &#147;Hai!&#148; When Sakura looked away Tomoyo stared at 
the pencil in her hand, then held it close.
~
	&#147;Sakura-chan!&#148; Rika scolded at lunch. &#147;What&#146;s with you? You&#146;ve 
been jumping all over the place today. You&#146;re so anxious, it&#146;s like 
you&#146;re looking for something.&#148;
	&#147;Rika-chan&#146;s right, are you feeling okay?&#148; Naoko asked 
curiously.
	&#147;Hey, Sakura.&#148; Syaoran said in his normal stiff voice, sitting 
at the other table their friends inhabited, the one where most of the 
boys sat. Sakura glanced at her boyfriend, wondering fleetingly if the 
bond they shared was love. At times it seemed simply like coldness to 
her. Hate?
	&#147;Hey, there&#146;s the new girl!&#148; Chiharu said with a smile. 
&#147;Daidouji-san was her name, wasn&#146;t it?&#148;
	Sakura&#146;s head jerked to where Chiharu was looking, and Sakura 
sprang up. &#147;Tomoyo-san!&#148; Sakura waved cheerfully, suddenly feeling 
happier, like she had been all day since English. It seemed that 
Tomoyo took all of her classes, but she had been pulled out in the 
middle of the day to be fitted for a gym uniform, so Sakura hadn&#146;t 
seen the girl for a while.
	Tomoyo smiled and started walking over to Sakura&#146;s table.
	Chiharu yanked Sakura down. &#147;Stop it Sakura-chan! You&#146;re 
embarrassing us! And we don&#146;t even know the new girl&#133;&#148;
	Sakura blushed, too happy to say anything mean. &#147;How will we 
ever get to know her if we don&#146;t make the effort?&#148;
	Chiharu just continued staring at Sakura as Tomoyo took a seat 
on the other side of Sakura. &#147;Ohayo, Sakura-chan! Do you mind if I 
call you Sakura-chan?&#148; Tomoyo asked worriedly.
	&#147;Iie!&#148; Sakura assured the other girl. &#147;But I&#146;ll have to call you 
Tomoyo-chan.&#148;
	Tomoyo smiled. &#147;That would be nice.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m Rika.&#148; Rika said cheerfully, not seeming to mind Sakura&#146;s 
energetic welcome. &#147;I&#146;m guessing we&#146;re all fourteen, so that we know 
about you. This is Naoko-chan, and this is Chiharu-chan.&#148; Rika 
motioned to both of the other girls in turn.
	&#147;It&#146;s nice to meet you.&#148; Naoko said. &#147;You look so pale, like a 
ghost! That&#146;s so cool!&#148;
	&#147;Hoe!&#148; Sakura exclaimed, causing her friends to look at her. She 
hadn&#146;t said that since the third grade or so, even before Syaoran and 
his cousin came into town. But then, she hadn&#146;t listened to them much, 
or given them or anyone else attention. She barely ever smiled&#133;
	&#147;You don&#146;t like ghosts?&#148; Tomoyo asked.
	&#147;N-no&#133;n-not r-really&#133;&#148; Sakura shivered. &#147;Onii-chan used to tell 
me about all the ghosts he saw&#133;and it was almost like I could feel 
them&#133;&#148;
	&#147;I never knew that.&#148; Naoko said, tilting her head to the side. 
&#147;Gomen, Sakura-chan.&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s okay&#133;&#148; Sakura said, smiling. &#147;I know you like them, so 
I&#146;ll just try not to think about it.
	Tomoyo smiled. &#147;That&#146;s brave, Sakura-chan.&#148;
	&#147;Ah&#133;arigatou.&#148; Sakura managed.
	 &#147;So, Tomoyo-chan&#133;what did you think about the English novel?&#148; 
Chiharu started.
~
	Touya heard the front door open and looked up at the clock. It 
was the time his sister got home. Touya sighed, wishing that she could 
be&#133;less hollow. It was like she was empty. And she was&#133;she loved both 
her father and brother, but she wasn&#146;t one for emotions anymore&#133;not 
like she had been since the third grade or so. 
	&#147;I&#146;m home!&#148; Touya thought for a moment a stranger was in the 
house, but recognized his sister&#146;s voice, though it was full of joy. 
Joy?
	&#147;Sakura?&#148; Touya asked, more than mildly confused as his younger 
sister bounded into the kitchen, sitting on a stool as she watched him 
stir something or other while cooking dinner.
	&#147;Onii-chan?&#148; Sakura asked cautiously, a smile still on her face.
	&#147;Who are you and what have you done with my sister?&#148; Touya 
demanded.
	&#147;Onii-chan! Um&#133;if you meet someone you really like, a friend, a 
best friend maybe, what would you give them?&#148; Sakura looked at Touya 
hopefully.
	Touya didn&#146;t know whom Sakura was referring to, but they had 
made her less hollow in just a few hours. Shrugging, he answered, &#147;I 
don&#146;t really know. Maybe a stuffed animal? You could always go out and 
buy one.&#148;
	Sakura sat in thought for a few moments, then smiled. &#147;That 
sounds good, but I&#146;d still like to get a few more opinions. Arigatou 
Onii-chan. Can you ask Otou-san when I could have a sleepover the next 
time you see him? Bye!&#148; Sakura ran out of the room and Touya soon 
heard her footsteps going upstairs.
	&#147;Uh&#133;bye&#133;&#148; Touya shrugged and went back to cooking.
~
	&#147;Kero-chan?&#148; Sakura threw her backpack down beside her bed. &#147;You 
here?&#148;
	&#147;AGH! I LOST AGAIN!&#148; Kero flew up from his game controller. 
&#147;Hey, Sakura. What&#146;s up?&#148;
	&#147;What would you get a friend you just made? As a present, I 
mean.&#148; Sakura sat down on the bed, twirling the key that hung around 
her neck out of a habit she had developed.
	Kero thought for about three seconds. &#147;Chocolate cake!&#148;
	Sakura sweatdropped. &#147;Uh, Kero-chan? I mean a human friend. Not 
everyone likes cake.&#148;
	&#147;What?! How can they not like cake?!&#148;
	&#147;Um&#133;hey! Could I use the Create Card to make a gift?&#148; Sakura 
asked.
	&#147;I guess&#133;&#148; Kero frowned. &#147;It would take something out of you, 
but if you do it now, just before dinner and bed, you should gain back 
the energy in no time.&#148;
	&#147;Huh? But it usually doesn&#146;t take much energy to use the cards.&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s different when you use the cards from the heart, spending 
quite a bit of thought on the object you want to make or the goal you 
wish to attain.&#148; Kero explained. &#147;But I&#146;ll supervise, so you have 
nothing to worry about kid!&#148; Kero flew over to Sakura&#146;s desk and sat 
down. &#147;Let&#146;s get started!&#148;
	&#147;Right!&#148;
~
	Although I&#146;ve invoked all of my cards&#146; power I have no clue what 
to do&#133;Sakura closed her eyes, searching her mind for the perfect gift 
to give a new friend. Wait a second! How about a locket? No, it has to 
be special&#133;A friendship locket. That would mean I have to make 
two&#133;hmm. I know!
	Sakura&#146;s eyes opened slowly. &#147;Create! Make me two lockets that 
can be shaped by magic of other cards for when I get started! Make 
them so they can hold great magic, and channel it.&#148; Sakura smiled at 
two small lockets floated into her hand. A sun locket and a crescent 
moon locket.
	&#147;Light! Give the sun locket the power to light all places when 
invoked! Give this locket the power of your card.&#148; Sakura threw the 
locket over to the bright woman, who smiled and laughed.
	&#147;Oh! Magic! It&#146;s been so long since we made something useful!&#148; 
Light sang as she went about her task, smiling.
	&#147;Dark! Imbue the crescent moon locket with the powers of your 
card!&#148; Sakura tossed the other pendant to the woman in the shadows 
next to Light.
	&#147;Of course&#133;&#148; Dark replied softly, her voice washing over the 
room.
	&#147;Flower! Would you please be so kind as to bless these lockets?&#148; 
Sakura asked, laughing as her friends, her cards, swirled about, all 
eager to help.
	Flower giggled, and danced over to the other two.
	&#147;Everyone else, bless each locket with the gift you see fit.&#148; 
Sakura said, smiling. &#147;But each only bless ONE locket. And Create? Can 
you be so kind as to make an invocation spell that goes along with 
them?&#148;
~
	A few hours later Sakura looks down at her work, the cards 
around her all smiling and chattering, except for the Silent and a few 
other cards. &#147;Oh&#133;I got so carried away in the magic I forgot that this 
was a gift for a normal person&#133;&#148;
	&#147;You can still give it to that person Mistress. In fact, you may 
have to. When you started you had this person in mind, therefore only 
that person may work whichever locket was the one you intended for 
her. Otherwise the locket may seek her out on it&#146;s own.&#148; Mirror said 
thoughtfully.
	&#147;I guess you&#146;re right Mirror. Oh well. I have to get to dinner, 
so I&#146;ll give the crescent moon locket to her tomorrow.&#148; Sakura said 
cheerfully.
	&#147;If you say so&#133;&#148; The Voice said.
	&#147;I do.&#148;
~
	Tomoyo smiled as she walked down the street. She hadn&#146;t been 
having luck finding the Card-User, but perhaps she would find him or 
her soon. She had met a sweet girl named Sakura though. Tomoyo sighed, 
smiling at the same time. &#147;I just got here and already I have friends! 
Humans are easier to get along with then witches.&#148;
	&#147;Tomoyo-chan!&#148; Turning, the lavender-haired heiress looked to 
see who had called to her.
	A smile lit Tomoyo&#146;s face. &#147;Sakura-chan!&#148;
	The brunette reached Tomoyo easily, barely breaking a sweat. 
&#147;Konnichiwa! Mind if I walk to school with you?&#148;
	&#147;Konnichiwa! Not at all, Sakura-chan. You know, you should join 
cheerleading. Maybe track as well.&#148; Tomoyo smiled.
	&#147;You think so?&#148; Sakura asked in a surprised voice.
	&#147;Hai! And I could tape your meets and practices! It would be so 
much fun! Okaa-san gave me a camcorder last month that I never got to 
use.&#148; Tomoyo explained, sparkles in her eyes. &#147;I&#146;d love to tape you!&#148;
	Sakura blushed, putting a hand behind her head. &#147;Hoe&#133;Oh!&#148; She 
reached into her pocket, and dug out the crescent moon necklace. &#147;I 
made&#133;got this for you! I have a sun one. They&#146;re friendship 
necklaces.&#148;
	Tomoyo blushed as Sakura fastened the silver chain around the 
heiress&#146;s neck. &#147;It&#146;s&#133;beautiful. But why&#146;d you give it to me?&#148;
	Sakura blushed again. &#147;Because we&#146;re friends now. That&#146;s what 
friends do.&#148;
	&#147;Oh!&#148; Tomoyo exclaimed. &#147;The locket won&#146;t open&#133;&#148;
	Sakura sweatdropped. &#147;Uh&#133;it will someday. I promise. It&#146;s set to 
open later.&#148; Like when you say the incantation&#133;
	&#147;How smart!&#148; Tomoyo smiled sweetly.
	&#147;C&#146;mon, we&#146;ll be late for school. And if I join cheerleading and 
track you join choir. You have a pretty voice!&#148; Sakura said, taking 
her friend&#146;s hand and starting to walk again.
~
	&#147;What?&#148; Syaoran asked, slightly confused. The boys had decided 
to sit with the girls today, a common occurrence.
	&#147;I&#146;m joining cheerleading.&#148; Sakura said with a smile. &#147;A friend 
told me I was very athletic, and should use my abilities more often.&#148;
	&#147;Sakura-chan&#133;I&#146;m getting worried about you&#133;&#148; Chiharu said with a 
frown.
	&#147;Oh, come on. You&#146;re on the cheerleading squad Chiharu-chan! So 
is Naoko-chan! Rika-chan joined then quit last year.&#148; Sakura rolled 
her eyes.
	&#147;But you&#146;ve never done anything like this before!&#148; Rika 
protested. She was cut off when Sakura started waving.
	&#147;Ohayo! How is everyone today?&#148; Tomoyo asked as she sat across 
from Sakura, as Syaoran and Chiharu were sitting next to Sakura.
	Sakura smiled brightly. &#147;Ohayo Tomoyo-chan! This is 
Yamazaki-chan, Chiharu&#146;s boyfriend, and this is my boyfriend, 
Syaoran.&#148;
	Tomoyo&#146;s eyes darkened, then brightened, as if nothing had ever 
happened. &#147;A pleasure to meet you both.&#148; Tomoyo bowed in their 
direction.
	&#147;So, about tonight Sakura&#133;&#148; Syaoran started, only to be cut off 
by his own girlfriend.
	&#147;That&#146;s right! Tomoyo-chan, my father said it would be all right 
if I asked you to sleepover tonight! Would you like to?&#148; Sakura asked 
cheerfully, her eyes brighter then any of her friends sitting around 
her had seen them for years.
	&#147;Hai!&#148; Tomoyo agreed quickly, almost jumping out of her seat.
	Syaoran looked at his usually calm, quiet, hardly there 
girlfriend. She usually blended in with the air so well she was almost 
invisible. She was a girl he thought Ieran-sama would approve of. And 
now she&#146;d gone crazy after meeting the new girl. They were acting like 
little kids.
	&#147;By the way&#133;&#148; Tomoyo pushed her food around with her fork for a 
bit. &#147;I&#146;ve heard that strange things happen around here. Like&#133;lots of 
weird people in costumes show up? And some paranormal things?&#148; She had 
to get around to tracking down the Card-User someday.
	Sakura almost choked up her food, as did Syaoran.
	&#147;Hai! It happens all the time! I can tell you all about it&#133;&#148; 
Naoko started.
~
	Tomoyo sighed, leaning against the wall between classes. &#147;I&#146;ll 
find you sometime&#133;I&#146;ve been looking for two days&#133;oh, Okaa-san would be 
so determined to help me find you if she were here. Too bad she isn&#146;t. 
Okaa-san&#133;I&#146;ll find the one I was chosen to protect. I promise. But for 
now&#133;I have to finish the day so I can go to a sleepover!&#148; Tomoyo 
blushed, and walked off, humming.
	&#147;Hmm?&#148; A strange boy steps from around the corner, his eyes
