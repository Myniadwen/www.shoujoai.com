<h1>Just Love Me</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chirino.html">Ricardo Chirino</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I&#39;m not sure if she&#39;ll notice. I think that sooner or later she has
to... I&#39;m always by her side, and it hurts me deep inside to hide my
feelings towards her. I&#39;m not going to feel happiness ever again if I
lose her -perhaps it&#39;s fate- but I... I must confess my love for her.
She has to know. She has the right to know! And I want to tell her...
Sakura, my love.

The sun rose and some of its golden rays entered Tomoyo&acute;s big room
through the windows. The soft satin curtains couldn&#39;t hold the wave of
light produced by the morning sun, but the illumination of the room
certainly was beautiful. Tomoyo slowly opened her eyes. She still
thought about the dream she had.

&quot;Sakura-chan&quot; she whispered. A tear started to run, washing her cheek.
&quot;God. Who am I kidding? All these years. I want to hold her... Today
I&#39;ll tell her my true feelings.&quot;

Tomoyo&#39;s look was melancholic and full of sadness. She thought only of
Sakura.

Sakura got up early too. Kero, on the other hand, was snoring and
mumbling some nonsense about the videogame he was playing yesterday.
Sakura saw this and decided to leave him resting. After all, she didn&#39;t
need Kero for anything at the moment. She quickly changed her pajamas
for some comfortable day clothing, consisting on an orange cotton shirt
(with the trademark wings on it) and a light brown short.

Hastily, she got down to the dining room. T&ocirc;ya was there, and her
father was cooking something.

&quot;Ohayo brother! Good morning daddy!&quot; she said cheerfully.

&quot;Ohayo my sweet princess...&quot; replied her father, while keeping focused
on what he was cooking.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Sakura? You certainly look happy, and it&#39;s just a
normal Sunday...&quot; T&ocirc;ya said to his sister.

&quot;I&#39;m very happy, because Tomoyo invited me to the park today. She said
she&#39;ll bring lunch for both of us.&quot;

&quot;Is that so...&quot; T&ocirc;ya muttered.

The rest of the morning was pretty normal. Sakura helped her father
with the cleaning and T&ocirc;ya went to Yuki&#39;s place, as usual. Sakura was
very happy, and her father, seeing how happy she was, felt an
incredible joy.

&quot;She&#39;s my sweet angel.&quot; he thought. &quot;She reminds me of my dear
Nadeshiko.&quot;

Sakura noticed that her father was looking at her, smiling. She felt
even happier than before and ran to him, hugging him strongly.

&quot;Dad. I love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too, Sakura-chan&quot; he said caringly. She giggled, and felt
in heaven for a short period of time.

&quot;Sakura, may I ask you something?&quot;

&quot;Sure, daddy&quot;

&quot;I noticed you are glowing today. You are happy because Tomoyo-chan
asked you to go with her to the park, right?&quot;

Sakura blushed. &quot;Y. Yes. I really enjoy being near Tomoyo-chan. I feel
a nice warmth when I&#39;m near her.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; he smiled. &quot;Well, then go, you don&#39;t want to be late.&quot;

Sakura noticed the hour. It was noon, and by that time she should&#39;ve
left the house already.

&quot;Oh! I&#39;m going now!&quot; she kissed her father, and quickly grabbed her
roller skates.

&quot;Sakura really likes Tomoyo... I&#39;m glad she has such a trustworthy
friend. She deserves no less...&quot; said her father to himself. &quot;Well,
back to work!&quot;

When Sakura reached the park she saw Tomoyo was already there. She
looked splendid. Sakura didn&#39;t notice, but she blushed when she saw
Tomoyo-chan there. She was wearing a gorgeous golden dress. Her long
and smooth black hair was flowing quietly with the soft wind. Sakura
ran to her and sat by her side. Sakura also noticed the two boxes with
the lunch. The smell of the food was really nice.

&quot;Hello Tomoyo!&quot; she smiled.

Tomoyo smiled sadly. &quot;Hi, Sakura.&quot;

Sakura noticed the expression Tomoyo had on her face. It was not one of
happiness. She was confused. &quot;Is there something wrong, Tomoyo-chan?&quot;

&quot;Sakura... I have to tell you something.&quot;

&quot;Sure. I&#39;m all ears.&quot; Sakura held one of Tomoyo&#39;s hands. She was warm
and soft. She really loved how Tomoyo&#39;s creamy skin felt.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how to say this, but...&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Sakura blushed. She had an idea of what she wanted to say. &quot;So
it was real... It was not my imagination.&quot;

&quot;I. I&#39;m in love with you, Sakura-chan. All these...&quot; Tomoyo was
suddenly stopped by one of Sakura&#39;s soft fingers.

&quot;Shhh... don&#39;t say it. I already know, Tomoyo-chan.&quot; Sakura rested her
head on Tomoyo&#39;s lap. She was really happy. Maybe because she saw in
Tomoyo a motherly figure... The mother she knew so little about, but
loved like no one could ever love a mother. She also felt something new
to her when she was with Tomoyo. Could it be desire? At any rate, all
that mattered to Sakura was to be with Tomoyo-chan.

&quot;Please forgive me, Tomoyo.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; she asked. She was enjoying herself a lot. She was so
happy: Not only she knew that Sakura-chan also felt love for her, but
they were near, feeling each other.

&#147;For not noticing it earlier... I&#39;ve been so careless about us. You must
have suffered a lot, thanks to my stupidity.&quot;

Tomoyo felt a great happiness. She was so happy that some tears began
to flow down her soft and sweet face. Sakura wiped the tears of her
friend&#39;s face.

&quot;Please, don&#39;t cry. Just... Just hold me.&quot;

For a long time they held each other. They were so happy like that.
They didn&#39;t care for anything else. For Sakura only Tomoyo existed. For
Tomoyo, Sakura was the only thing that was really important.

&quot;Sakura-chan. I love you with all my heart.&quot;

&quot;I love you too, Tomoyo-chan. Promise me that you&#39;ll never leave me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll never leave you, Sakura. I love you with all my strength... I
have loved you ever since I first saw you. I live for you Sakura...&quot;

&quot;Oh, Tomoyo...&quot; now Sakura was the one bursting in tears. Tomoyo held
her strongly against herself. She kissed her softly on the lips. &quot;I&#39;m
so happy, Tomoyo. Please, just... Just love me.&quot;
