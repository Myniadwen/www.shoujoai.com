<h1>Darkest Before the Dawn (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/darkdawn-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The lightning exploded outward, throwing them all backward a few 
steps. Roof tiles flew through the air by them, until Kaho managed to 
raise some kind of mystic barrier to shield herself, Tomoyo and 
Sonomi. The black smoke was too thick to see through for a moment, but 
it gradually cleared enough to reveal the battlefield.

Sakura hovered there in the air, the wings of the Fly card stretched 
out behind her, the Sword ready in her hand. Mei-Lin looked up at her, 
coldly furious, as lightning raced up and down her own sword, the 
strange metal coins she used for her magic clasped in her hand.

&#39;And the Christmas party was going so well, too,&#39; Tomoyo thought to 
herself wearily, remembering how this evening had started for them, 
not too long ago.



The doorbell rang, and Tomoyo jumped up to her feet to answer it. She 
and Sakura had been dancing cautiously around each other all day after 
what had happened between them last night. &#39;And our little talk this 
morning,&#39; Tomoyo thought to herself. She wasn&#39;t quite sure what to 
make of what Sakura had said to her, scared to get her hopes up.

She opened the door to be greeted by Sonomi&#39;s wide smile. She saw who 
was standing just behind her and felt her mouth dropping open in 
shock. Kaho Mitsuki smiled over at Tomoyo gently, a small pile of 
gifts cradled in her arms.

Kaho said softly, &quot;Merry Christmas, Tomoyo.&quot;

Tomoyo recovered from her surprise enough to invite them both inside, 
shooting a fierce glare at her mother for keeping it a surprise. 
&quot;Welcome,&quot; she said with a smile, and noticing the pile of gifts 
added, &quot;here, just put them down by the tree.&quot;

Sonomi said softly, &quot;Sorry, I just couldn&#39;t resist keeping her a 
secret.&quot; She smiled a bit as she said teasingly, &quot;Forgive me?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; Tomoyo sassed back at her. She saw Sakura 
step up to greet Kaho and suddenly found herself wondering if Sakura 
understood what was going on between Kaho and Sonomi, that they were 
girlfriends.

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you again, Ms Mitsuki,&quot; Sakura said with a smile, 
helping her with her packages. &quot;So how long have you and Sonomi been 
dating?&quot; she asked her cheerfully.

&#39;Yes, she knows,&#39; Tomoyo thought, hiding a smile.

&quot;Call me Kaho,&quot; Kaho said with a smile. &quot;We&#39;ve been seeing each other 
for a month or so,&quot; she explained, &quot;after meeting at a little bar not 
far from here.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Kaho,&quot; Sakura smiled back at her. They spent a few moments 
arranging the pile of gifts, while Tomoyo and Sonomi busied themselves 
making everyone drinks.

Sakura and Kaho got up to be met by Tomoyo and Sonomi, each bearing a 
pair of drinks. Sonomi sat one down for her and one for Tomoyo while 
Tomoyo herself delivered the drinks to the other two women.

&quot;There&#39;s some rum in your eggnog,&quot; Tomoyo said to Kaho, then she 
passed one over to Sakura, &quot;and here&#39;s a plain one for you, OK?&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Tomoyo,&quot; Sakura said, and then she surprised her with a 
single gentle kiss on her cheek. Both Kaho and Sonomi looked on with 
some amusement as Tomoyo went beet red, her mouth partially open in 
surprise.

They settled down on the two living room couches, Tomoyo and Sakura on 
one and Kaho and Sonomi cuddling together on the other. The fire 
burned cheerfully, the lights dimmed to highlight the tree and the 
gentle flames.

&quot;Sonomi tells me you&#39;re a documentary filmmaker,&quot; Kaho said to Tomoyo 
softly. A little smile teased her lips as she added teasingly &quot;No one, 
of course, was very surprised, I trust?&quot;

&quot;No surprise at all,&quot; Tomoyo agreed with a soft laugh.

&quot;Are you still teaching?&quot; Sakura asked Kaho curiously. &quot;I&#39;ve become a 
school teacher, myself,&quot; she said with a smile, &quot;so I was wondering.&quot;

&quot;I got out of teaching,&quot; Kaho admitted, &quot;a couple of years ago.&quot;

&quot;But you were so good at it,&quot; Tomoyo said a bit regretfully.

&quot;After everything that happened to us with the Clow cards,&quot; Kaho said 
softly, &quot;I began to reevaluate certain things in my life. It seemed to 
me that there might be some better uses to my talents than teaching.&quot;

&quot;So she became a ghostbuster,&quot; Sonomi said with a quirky little smile.

Kaho shot her a dark look while Sakura and Tomoyo chuckled softly. 
&quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple,&quot; she scolded her gently, &quot;I consider 
myself a paranormal investigator, helping people who have problems 
that are outside the normal world.&quot;

&quot;Ghostbuster,&quot; Sonomi repeated with a little shrug. She smiled over at 
Sakura, &quot;Do you enjoy teaching, then?&quot;

&quot;Very much,&quot; Sakura agreed, then she laughed softly. &quot;Except around 
exam time,&quot; she added with a rueful smile.

Kaho laughed softly, nodding her agreement. &quot;I remember exams,&quot; she 
said feelingly. She smiled over at Tomoyo, &quot;I saw your last 
documentary, the one on Angelic Layer. Is it really that popular here 
in Tokyo?&quot;

Before she could answer her, there was a soft knock on the door. &quot;I&#39;ll 
get it,&quot; Tomoyo said, getting up to go over to the front door. &#39;No one 
else was invited tonight,&#39; she thought with a little frown on her 
pretty face.

She opened the door and gaped in surprise. Mei-Lin looked at her 
calmly, her long black hair tied back; wearing a costume like the one 
she once wore chasing the Clow cards. &quot;I need to see Sakura,&quot; she said 
simply to Tomoyo.

&quot;Sakura?&#39; Tomoyo echoed, surprised. She shook herself, &quot;Come in, 
please. What do you need to see Sakura for?&quot; Her eyes widened slightly 
when she saw the sheathed sword over the young woman&#39;s shoulder.

She barged right by Tomoyo, making a path to Sakura. Sakura got up and 
walked towards her as she asked, &quot;What can I do for you?&quot;

Before anyone could do anything, the sword appeared in Mei-Lin&#39;s 
hands, and she swung it at Sakura, demanding, &quot;Why did you do it?&quot;

Sakura ducked, barely below the blow, crying out &quot;Did what?!&quot;

&quot;You know!&quot; Mei-Lin cried out, swinging again. Seeing she wasn&#39;t going 
to hit her normally she pulled an odd, metallic coin from her belt. 
&quot;Element,&quot; she cried, &quot;wind!&quot; The sword struck the coin, and Sakura 
was hit by a massive gust of wind.

Sakura struggled against it for a moment, then she lost her balance 
and flew right out the apartment window. There was a crash of breaking 
glass and then Sakura was gone.

&quot;Sakura!&quot; Tomoyo cried, running towards the hole in the wall. Sonomi 
grabbed at her, holding her back from the edge.

A stunned Sakura fell, the air swirling around her. Her head was 
ringing, she couldn&#39;t seem to concentrate. Strangely, her life didn&#39;t 
run before her eyes, instead her life with Tomoyo did. A moment of 
clarity came over her, and she understood at last what she had to 
fight for.

&quot;Fly!&quot; she cried out, her star staff appearing in her hands. Wings 
appeared from her back, slowing her fall then carrying her back up to 
the apartment.

A sobbing Tomoyo ran at Mei-Lin, hammering at her with her closed 
fists, &quot;How could you! She never did anything to you!&quot;

&quot;She killed Li,&quot; Mei-Lin answered her coldly, and Tomoyo suddenly felt 
her blood run cold. A small smile teased her lips as she leveled her 
sword outside, &quot;And she hasn&#39;t paid for it yet.&quot;

Tomoyo whirled around, to see Sakura floating out there, her wings 
beating around her. &#39;She looks like an angel,&#39; a wondering Tomoyo 
found herself thinking. She was astonished at how calm Sakura looked, 
almost like she was at peace.

&quot;If we fight here,&quot; Sakura said, holding up a hand to stop Mei-Lin&#39;s 
move to attack, &quot;innocents will be hurt. Let&#39;s take this somewhere 
else.&quot;

Mei-Lin paused, then she nodded slightly, admitting, &quot;Li wouldn&#39;t have 
wanted his friends hurt.&quot; She quietly suggested, &quot;Shall we go 
upstairs?&quot;

&quot;Lets,&quot; Sakura answered her simply. Mei-Lin ran out the door to the 
stairs even as Sakura took a moment to fly into the apartment to stand 
at Tomoyo&#39;s side. Sweeping Tomoyo up into her arms she said softly, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know why she&#39;s after me, but it doesn&#39;t matter now.&quot;

Tomoyo opened her mouth to try and say something, and Sakura shushed 
her.

&quot;When I was falling out there, thinking that I might die, I realized 
something,&quot; Sakura said softly, &quot;I love you, Tomoyo, and I wish I had 
known sooner.&quot;

Tomoyo grabbed at her, but Sakura slipped from her grasp, flying out 
the window. She stood there, shocked, until Kaho grabbed her by the 
shoulder and shook her, fiercely asking &quot;What do you want us to do?&quot;

Sonomi looked as shocked as she did, stunned at how their deeds had 
come back to haunt them. &#39;I should have thought of this,&#39; she shook 
her head. &quot;We&#39;ve got to help, somehow,&quot; Tomoyo said softly, aloud. 
Kaho nodded firmly, and the three of them ran for the stairs.

The stairwell itself shook, the sound of distant explosions ringing 
through the building. The reached the roof door, discovering it was 
jammed from the other side. &quot;Let&#39;s push together,&quot; Sonomi said 
intensely, leading them, &quot;One! Two! Three!&quot; With a combined shove, the 
door flopped open, spilling them on the snow-covered roof.



&#39;Which brings us back to the present,&#39; Tomoyo thought, keeping her 
head down as she watched the battle continue. Sakura dived and weaved, 
sword swinging to parry all of Mei-Lin&#39;s many attacks on her. 
Lightning, wind, fire, Mei-Lin kept throwing elemental attacks at 
Sakura, but she agilely dodged them all.

&quot;Why isn&#39;t she using the Sword to end this?&#39; Kaho said to herself 
softly. Getting an inquiring look from Sonomi, she added &quot;Sword should 
be able to cut anything, even Mei-Lin&#39;s sword.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s holding back,&quot; Tomoyo realized, looking at Sakura, &quot;she doesn&#39;t 
want to hurt her.&quot;

&quot;But Mei-Lin&#39;s trying to kill her!&quot; Sonomi exclaimed.

The sword clanged together, and for a moment they were face to face. 
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you would pay someone to kill Li,&quot; Mei-Lin said to 
her fiercely. Sakura stopped a moment, her eyes widening for a moment, 
then they narrowed.

&#39;Tomoyo,&#39; Sakura was suddenly struck by the thought, &#39;or maybe Sonomi. 
It had to be.&#39; She remembered coming to Tomoyo for help, her body 
wracked with pain from Li&#39;s last beating, and suddenly was struck by 
how much it had hurt Tomoyo as well, to see her like that. Before she 
could consider any more, Mei-Lin attacked!

&#39;I have my own magic now,&#39; Mei-Lin thought to herself fiercely, &#39;so 
why can&#39;t I hurt her?&#39; She swung again and again, her magics flaring 
up against Sakura. But each attack she tried, every strike, was 
stopped cold by the mistress of the Clow cards.

&quot;Stop this, now!&quot; Tomoyo yelled, breaking free of the others to run 
between Mei-Lin and Sakura, arms spread to stop the battle.

&quot;Tomoyo! No!&quot; Sakura cried out worriedly.

&quot;Out of the way, Tomoyo,&quot; Mei-Lin hissed at her harshly.

&quot;No,&quot; Tomoyo said calmly. She took a deep breath, to steady her before 
she said, &quot;Sakura didn&#39;t kill Li, Mei-Lin.&quot;

&quot;I did,&quot; Sonomi softly said, stepping up to stand by Tomoyo. &quot;Or at 
least, I arranged for it to be done,&quot; she clarified.

&quot;You&#39;re lying,&quot; Mei-Lin said tentatively, sounding quite unsure of the 
statement. &quot;How could you have done that to him,&quot; she said softly, as 
the possibilities slowly dawned on her. They had the money, the power 
to do it, but why?.

Tomoyo took a deep breath, knowing that Mei-Lin wouldn&#39;t want to hear 
what she was about to say to her. &quot;Sakura came to me for help,&quot; she 
said softly, calmly meeting Mei-Lin&#39;s eyes, &quot;even though she could 
barely stand up. She was bruised down the side of her body, so much so 
that her skin was almost black.&quot;

&quot;When she finally got to sleep,&quot; Sonomi said softly, &quot;she&#39;d turn over 
in her sleep, and almost every time we&#39;d hear a soft whimper of pain, 
when she pressed down on a bruise.&quot; She looked at Mei-Lin, a fire in 
her eyes, &quot;After what I saw what he&#39;d done to her,&quot; she said in a 
whisper, &quot;I knew we had to do whatever it took to protect her.&quot;

Mei-Lin stood there, reluctant tears trickling down her cheeks, &quot;He 
couldn&#39;t have... wouldn&#39;t have.&quot; She shook her head, trying to deny 
their words. &quot;Why...&quot;

A soft but strong voice, familiar to them, all spoke out. &quot;Jealousy,&quot; 
Yue said, his blue wings holding him aloft, &quot;for Sakura&#39;s achievement. 
She claimed the cards, and won in the final judgment, a test Li 
himself failed at.&quot;

&quot;He never got over that anger,&quot; Keroberos said sadly, the giant golden 
lion standing on the snow-covered ledge. &quot;He couldn&#39;t seem to let it 
go,&quot; he continued softly.

Sonomi, Tomoyo and Kaho looked at the two of them, wondering where 
they had come from. Toya stepped out of the snow to Tomoyo&#39;s side, a 
wry smile on his face. &quot;I felt something was happening,&quot; he whispered 
to her, &quot;I hope we were in time.&quot;

&quot;Better late than never,&quot; Kaho said with a smile. &quot;Nice timing, Toya.&quot;

&quot;You could be lying too,&quot; Mei-Lin said, tears streaking her face as 
the words sank in.

Yue smiled at her sadly, &quot;You know me, I think, and you should know 
that it isn&#39;t in my nature to lie.&quot; He tilted his head sideways, &quot;So 
what will you do now?&quot;

Mei-Lin stood there, her shoulders bent. She only loosely held her 
sword, fingers loose around the hilt. She tensed, looking up to where 
Tomoyo and Sonomi stood, and pointed her sword towards them. Toya 
pushed them behind him even as she began to speak.

&quot;The vendetta is over,&quot; Mei-Lin said softly, tears streaking her face, 
&quot;at least it is for me.&quot; The sword was quite ceremoniously sheathed 
over her shoulder, and she slowly began to walk away. Over her 
shoulder she quietly added, &quot;I would recommend staying away from Hong 
Kong. Li&#39;s family will not be so forgiving.&quot;

Before anyone could say anything, Mei-Lin was gone, running down the 
stairs at breakneck speed. Sakura softly said to Kero, &quot;Could you 
change form and follow her, please? After what she&#39;s just heard, she 
shouldn&#39;t be alone right now.&quot;

Kero looked at her a moment, then he smiled. &quot;She just tried to kill 
you,&quot; he said, shaking his head, &quot;and you&#39;re worried about her. 
Classic Sakura.&quot; In his small form, he flew off after her.

&quot;Is everyone all right?&quot; Yukito asked them, pushing his glasses up 
self-consciously. He shivered a bit, and Toya stepped up to wrap his 
coat around the frail shoulders, receiving a grateful smile in return.

&quot;Everyone&#39;s fine,&quot; Sakura assured them both, &quot;and thank you, both, for 
your help.&quot;

Toya smiled wryly, looking between Sakura, Sonomi, and Tomoyo. &quot;I 
suspect you&#39;ve got some things to talk about,&quot; he said softly, &quot;so 
we&#39;ll be going.&quot; After delivering Christmas wishes, the two young men 
walked down the stairs together.

They stood there silently a moment, each waiting for the other to 
speak. Growing tired of the silence Kaho spoke up, &quot;We probably should 
go see how damaged the apartment is.&quot;

They walked down stairs together, warming up as they went deeper into 
the building. &quot;You should have told me,&quot; Sakura said softly.

&quot;I wanted to,&quot; Tomoyo admitted, &quot;every day. I wanted to tell you that 
I could protect you, watch over you, but that isn&#39;t what you needed to 
hear.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Sakura said, looking over at Tomoyo, her expression 
unreadable.

&quot;After that fight, I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t need protecting,&quot; Tomoyo 
continued softly. &quot;You&#39;re strong, capable, and well able to take care 
of yourself,&quot; she smiled sadly.

&quot;So why did I get hurt by Li?&quot; Sakura asked softly.

&quot;We make mistakes, occasionally. And maybe if I spoke up a bit 
stronger, then, it might not have happened,&quot; Tomoyo answered. &quot;I guess 
we all need someone to watch our backs occasionally, even you,&quot; she 
said with a shrug.

Sakura was silent, seemingly weighing those words in light of what she 
had learned. She reached out to take Tomoyo&#39;s hand, &quot;I love you, 
Tomoyo.&quot; She smiled a bit, adding, &quot;Just don&#39;t hold things back from 
me again, please?&quot;

&quot;Deal. And I love you, too,&quot; Tomoyo answered her tearfully.

They went through the apartment doors to see a state of complete ruin. 
The tree was down, fire out, and the pile of presents were soaked by 
where the rain and snow had blown inside.

&quot;I guess you&#39;re moving back home for tonight,&quot; Sonomi said, looking 
around a bit sadly at the ruins of their Christmas party.

&quot;I suppose,&quot; Tomoyo said, giving Sakura a sly glance, &quot;we&#39;ll have to 
share a room.&quot; Sakura blushed redly, and Sonomi and Kaho laughed 
softly.

&quot;This party&#39;s a bust,&quot; Kaho said with a soft sigh. She looked 
thoughtful, &quot;There is that all night party at the Locket tonight.&quot;

Sonomi looked surprised as she said, &quot;We really shouldn&#39;t throw the 
two of them into the deep end so quickly.&quot;

&quot;The Locket?&quot; Sakura echoed curiously.

&quot;It&#39;s a ladies club,&quot; Tomoyo said with a little smile, &quot;not too far 
from here. I&#39;ve been once or twice.&quot; Both Kaho and Sonomi gave her 
thoughtful looks, and she blushed.

Sakura surprised them by laughing softly, &quot;I have magic powers, a book 
full of Clow cards, and all three of you to watch over me. I&#39;m sure 
it&#39;ll be all right.&quot;

&quot;You asked for it,&quot; Sonomi said dangerously, and they were off. </pre>
