<pre>    &quot;Tomoyo-chan...&quot;

    Sakura held her friend&#39;s limp body in her arms.  Next to her was 
Tomoyo&#39;s camera, which was completely shattered.  Tears ran down 
Sakura&#39;s face.

    &quot;Sakura...&quot;  A small figure flew next to her.

    &quot;It&#39;s my fault Kero.  I knew it was dangerous, but I didn&#39;t think 
it would go after her.  I didn&#39;t even get a chance to warn her.  
I...I... The next thing I remember was a scream.  I followed it 
and...&quot;

    Sakura collapsed on the floor.  Her tears fell on Tomoyo&#39;s dress.  
Her body was shaking as she held Tomoyo close to her.

    &quot;Why?&quot;  She could feel the salty tears fill her mouth and burn her 
cheeks.

    Kero closed his eyes.  The pain dug into him.  This hurt him as 
much as Sakura.  He heard a noise and turned around and saw Li with a 
card in his hand.

    &quot;Brat.&quot;

    He looked at the two figures on the ground and nodded his head.  
Kero nodded back, he usually wouldn&#39;t agree with HIM, but in this case 
they were both thinking the same thing, and both of them left Sakura 
alone with Tomoyo.

                    *********

    She smiled at her.  Her eyes were red.

    &quot;I know what you meant Tomoyo-chan, when you said I really love 
you.  I didn&#39;t release  it then, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  More tears, it was 
hurting her to say this.

    &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?  Were you afraid what I would say?  Were 
you afraid I wouldn&#39;t understand?  I understand, you see...

    She forced a smile.

    &quot;It was the same with me too.  I fell in love with you, but I 
couldn&#39;t tell you.  I was a coward.

    &quot;I...I love you Tomoyo-chan, I wanted to tell you tonight, I 
thought this card would be easy to catch, but...&quot;

    Tears ran down her face again.

    &quot;I underestimated it and...&quot;

    &quot;I lost the most important thing to me tonight...&quot;

    Her eyes, her cheeks, her face burned painfully.

    &quot;Please forgive me, for everything, for not realizing what you 
meant, when I did, for not telling you.&quot;

    &quot;I love you...&quot;

    She reached over and her lips touched Tomoyo&#39;s.  Her lips were 
cold, only a painful reminder.

    &quot;I wish...I could of given this to you.  But now...&quot;

    Now the one she loved was gone.
