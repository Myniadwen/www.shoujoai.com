<h1>Lost in the Garden of Tulips</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/glyde.html">Glyde Dranzer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Tomoyo and Sakura, hand in hand, marched to the dining room, armed with 
the love they share for each other, ready to face what seems to be a 
long and bitter war, determined to overcome all obstacles and emerge 
victorious. But this war is very much different, and they felt they may 
not win this one. Tomoyo retreated a step upon seeing her mother 
already seated. She looked at Sakura who was very much afraid, but the 
firmness of her grip urge her to go forward, holding in her heart the 
promise that no matter what happens they&#39;ll face it together. Sakura 
felt that she would rather face a million clow cards than the wrath of 
Tomoyo&#39;s mom, but they have gone so far to fall back and retreat.
&quot;Have a seat.&quot; Sonomi dictated upon seeing the couple. They complied 
and sat down. They visibly trembled as Sonomi prepared to speak.
&quot;Congratulations, you two.&quot;
Tomoyo&#39;s and Sakura&#39;s mouths fell open upon hearing those words. Sonomi 
had a sudden change. Her eyes were merry and a big smile was on her 
face. The couple was very confused. They expected a severe tongue 
lashing but this-
&quot;Huh? What-what do you mean?&quot; Sakura mouthed in surprise.
&quot;Does that mean-&quot; 
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; Sonomi interrupted her daughter, as if she read her mind.
Her acceptance was too much for the couple to bear.
&quot;Oh mom!&quot; Tomoyo exclaimed as she and Sakura went to hug Sonomi. Sonomi 
could say nothing as she cuddled the two.
&quot;thank you, thank you. Oh I&#39;m so happy.&quot; Tomoyo repeated over and over.
&quot;I&#39;m so happy for both of you, Tomoyo-chan.&quot; Sonomi began &quot; I knew you 
two would eventually have each other. I expected it right from the 
start but...&quot;
&quot;Huh? But what mom?&quot; Tomoyo asked.
Sonomi blushed deep red.
&quot;You really caught me by surprise back there.&quot;
Tomoyo and Sakura blushed as well as they remembered Sonomi entering 
the bathroom and seeing them lying on the sheets all covered in cum.
&quot;Oh that. Heheheh.&quot; Sakura chuckled in embarassment.
&quot;It&#39;s Sakura-chan&#39;s fault. She forgot to lock the door.&#39; and Tomoyo 
naughtily stuck her tongue out at Sakura.
&quot;What? You&#39;re the one who made the first move, sucking on my nipples 
and all that.&quot;
&quot;Well you liked it and begged me for more.&quot;
&quot;I begged? Yeah right. Coming from the girl who wanted seconds.&quot;
They all laughed hard about it.
&quot;C&#39;mon girls, enough chatter. Breakfast is getting cold.&quot; Sonomi said 
as the laughter subsided. She wiped the tears off her eyes, realizing 
it had been long since she experienced a true side splitting chuckle.
They began breakfast. Tomoyo and Sakura were very hungry. they finished 
their plates in no time and had second helpings.
&quot;Thank you. Breakfast was very delicious.&quot; Sakura said after the meal.
&quot;You&#39;re welcome. I expected you girls to be hungry like this so I said 
to the maids to prepare more than usual.&quot;
&quot;Wow mom. You expected everything.&quot; Tomoyo said.
&quot;Except that incident, though.&quot;
The couple blushed deep red again.
&quot;So, about that incident,&quot; Sonomi began, &quot;was that the first time you 
did it?&quot;
Sakura was a little reluctant to reply but Tomoyo wasn&#39;t.
&quot;No mom,&quot; Tomoyo smiled mischievously, &quot;we made love last night.&quot;
Sonomi was flushed with surprise.
&quot;Last night? How come I wasn&#39;t aware of that?&quot; Sonomi exclaimed.
Tomoyo and Sakura were speechless. 
&quot;Mind telling me every juicy detail?&quot; Sonomi asked, very much 
interested in their love life.
&quot;Every JUICY detail?&quot; Sakura bit on the word. She finished her sentence 
with a sigh. She didn&#39;t know what to tell her.
&quot;I want to know everything, if you don&#39;t mind me asking.&quot;
&quot;Of course not mom.&quot; Tomoyo smiled which made Sakura groan with 
embarrassment. &quot;It all started-&quot;
&quot;Oh shoot. Maybe next time.&quot; Sonomi huffed in disappointment as she 
caught a glance on her wristwatch.
&quot;Oh, too bad,&quot; Tomoyo sighed in mild disappointment, &quot;We&#39;re so eager to 
tell you, isn&#39;t that, Sakura-chan?&quot;
Sakura grunted in agreement but in her heart she was relieved. Who 
knows what Tomoyo may add to the story?
But Sakura&#39;s relief, however, was short and brief as Tomoyo whispered 
something in her mother&#39;s ear. She watched as Sonomi&#39;s eyebrows went up 
and a big smile formed on her face.
&quot; I wonder what Tomoyo-chan said to her?&quot; she asked herself.
&quot;Well done, sweetie,&quot; Sonomi said after Tomoyo was done. &quot; I&#39;m looking 
forward to it.&quot;
&quot;Looking forward to what?&quot; Sakura thought to herself.
&quot;Well, I&#39;m off to work.&quot; Sonomi said as she rose, taking her purse, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t spend more time with you girls.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s okay, mom.&quot; Tomoyo replied then kissed her.
They escorted her to the door.
&quot; I&#39;ll finish all my appointments today so I can take you shopping 
tomorrow.&quot;
&quot;Tomorrow? But-&quot; Sakura wasn&#39;t able to finish as Sonomi went toward the 
car. Tomoyo waved as the car drove off.

As the couple went upstairs;
&quot;Tomoyo-chan, about tomorrow-&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s mom&#39;s treat.&quot;
&quot;But dad&#39;s gonna pick me up later.&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t worry your pretty little head, Sakura-chan, I&#39;m sure mom can 
persuade your dad to let you stay a little longer.&quot;
When they got to Tomoyo&#39;s room, they heard her cell phone ring. Tomoy 
went to the phone and answered it.
&quot; Hello, who is this?&quot;
&quot;Tomoyo, can I speak to Sakura?&quot; came a man&#39;s voice.
&quot;Kinomoto-san, just a minute.&quot; she gave the phone to Sakura.
&quot;Hello dad, you called,&quot; Sakura answered, &quot;What is it?&quot;
&quot;Sonomoi called and asked if I can let you stay there for a while. 
Would you like to?&quot;
&quot;Of course dad. But what about my responsibilities back home?&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s all covered, honey. Touya didn&#39;t take it to well though.&quot;
She heard her father chuckle. Sakura groaned inwardly thinking what her 
big brother would make her do when she gets back home.
&quot;Okay, got to hang up now. You behave all right?&quot;
&quot;Sure dad thanks. Bye.&quot; she hung up.
&quot;Told you so.&quot; Tomoyo smiled.
&quot;Well, that was fast.&quot; Sakura observed.
&quot;Mom&#39;s a very good persuader.&quot; 
Sakura chuckled lightly.
&quot;I guess she is.&quot;
Sakura flopped softly on the bed.
&quot;So what are we going to do now?&quot;
Tomoyo smiled mischievously. They&#39;re all alone and she has Sakura to 
herself. They can make love all day, making Sakura cum all over her a 
dozen times or more. She wanted that to happen very much but she had 
other plans.
&quot;Why not invite Chiharu and the others over? It&#39;s lonely with the two 
of us.&quot;
&quot;Sure. Why not?&quot;
&quot;Great.&quot;
Sakura smiled as Tomoyo dialed the numbers. Tomoyo called Chiharu, Rika 
and Naoko and invited them over. They said they&#39;d love to and be there 
shortly. Tomoyo grinned as she set the phone aside.
&quot;While we wait, let&#39;s take care of tea and cake.&quot;
&quot;Sure. I help.&quot; Sakura agreed.
Everything was done by the time their guests arrived.
&quot;Good morning Tomoyo-chan, Sakura-chan.&quot; the guests greeted.
&quot;Good morning girls.&quot; Tomoyo returned.
They all took their seats and started tea.
&quot;So why invite us all of a sudden? Something on your mind?&quot; naoko 
asked.
&quot;We&#39;re you girls lonely?&quot; Rika asked.
&quot;Well, you could say that.&quot; Sakura replied.
&quot;Actually we have something to tell you.&quot; Tomoyo said.
&quot;Hmm? What is it?&quot; Chiharu asked.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan?&quot;
&quot; It&#39;s all right Sakura-chan. If they&#39;re our true friends they&#39;d 
understand.&quot;
&quot;Huh? Understand what?&quot; the three asked in unison.
&quot;Well, it&#39;s um...&quot; Sakura stammered.
&quot;We&#39;re in love with each other.&quot; Tomoyo finished.
Gasps filled the room.
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t think ill of us.&quot; Sakura said solemnly.
The others giggled.
&quot;It&#39;s the exact opposite Sakura-chan,&quot; Naoko said, &quot;I&#39;m so happy for 
you.&quot;
&quot;Eh? Really?&quot; came Sakura&#39;s happy voice.
&#39;We&#39;re just a surprised.&quot; Chiharu said.
&quot;Yeah, you were so in to boys we didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be a lesbian.&quot; Rika 
added.
&quot;I&#39;m so glad to hear that. You&#39;re really the best.&quot; Tomoyo said.
&quot;We&#39;re so lucky to have really good friends.&quot; Sakura said cheerfully.
The others giggled some more.
&quot; So, when did you girls hitch up? Did you have a date?&quot; the others 
asked relentlessly.
&quot;Girls, girls, one at a time.&quot; Tomoyo laughed.
&quot;C&#39;mon we want to know everything, right?&quot; Chiharu asked the others.
they grunted in agreement.
&quot;Well, we confessed our feelings for each other over dinner.&quot; Sakura 
related.
The girls gasped in awe.
&quot;Oh, how romantic!&quot; Chiharu exclaimed.
&quot;We&#39;re you able to tape it, Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Naoko asked.
Tomoyo smiled mischievously.
&#39;I&#39;m glad you asked that. Follow me.&quot; she said and went to the video 
room.
&quot;What? I didn&#39;t know that!&quot; Sakura exclaimed in surprise.
The others laughed. 
&quot;Tomoyo and Sakura sitting on a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G.&quot; they chanted 
which made Sakura blush with embarrassment.
While Tomoyo was busy setting things up, Sakura approached her from 
behind.
&quot;Tell me you only taped the dinner, please.&quot;
Tomoyo smiled and said nothing. The others kept on giggling and 
laughing until the monitor flickered.
&quot;Yey! It&#39;s about to start.&quot; Chiharu cheered.
Sakura and the others watched as last night&#39;s events replayed before 
them.
&quot;Wow! Candle light.&quot; Rika said.
&quot;The dim light is making the room more romantic.&quot; Naoko observed.
Tomoyo grinned.
&quot;Everything is going according to plan.&quot; she thought to herself. Then 
she made her next move.
&quot;My! Is it stuffy in here or is it just me?&quot; she said and started to 
take off her clothes.
&quot;Yeah. It is rather hot in here.&quot; the others said as they stripped down 
to their underwear.
&quot;What is Tomoyo-chan thinking?&quot; Sakura asked herself keeping her 
clothes on.
As the others watched, they laughed seeing how uncomfortable Sakura is.
&quot;Hey, hey! Look, they&#39;re going to confess to each other.&quot; Rika said in 
glee, her eyes glued to the monitor.
&quot;I... there&#39;s something I have to tell you.&quot; Tomoyo said in the video.
The others became quiet.
&quot;You love me? I love you too.&quot; Sakura said in the video.
&quot;How sweet!&#39; the others cheered.
Sakura was frantic. She knew exactly what was going to happen next.
&quot;Um, Sakura-chan... I think that&#39;s enough.&quot; she said nervously.
&quot;Nonsense, Sakura-chan. This is the best part.&quot; Tomoyo replied.
&quot;But Tomoyo-chan?&quot;
&quot;C&#39;mon girl, don&#39;t spoil our fun now.&quot; Chiharu said, her eyes still 
glued on the monitor.
Sakura sighed and resigned herself.
Gasps filled the movie room.
&quot;Oh my! They&#39;re kissing... and fondling each other!&quot; Rika exclaimed in 
surprise.
Everyone went quiet as they watched the lovemaking scene.
Tomoyo watched their expressions and reactions. They were dumbfounded 
at what they&#39;re watching but made no sighs of repugnance. Sakura was at 
a loss. What will her friends say after watching that scene? Looks like 
she&#39;ll find out as the movie ended.
Everyone was still speechless when they got out the movie room. They 
sat down at the table not saying a word.
&quot;So... what do you think?&quot; Tomoyo asked after a few minutes.
&quot;You really have to videotape everything huh, Tomoyo-chan?&quot; Sakura 
asked.
&quot;Wow! I should be careful what I wish for.&quot; Naoko finally said.
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Chiharu agreed.
&quot;That scene was really intense.&quot; Rika said.
&quot; It really was huh?&quot; Tomoyo asked naughtily.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan how could you show them something so private?&quot; Sakura 
demanded.
&quot;Now you know our most intimate secret. Keep it to yourselves okay?&quot; 
Tomoyo asked.
The others&#39; expressions brightened up.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry girl. It&#39;s safe with us.&quot; Chiharu reassured.
&quot;How were you able to pull off a stunt like that?&quot; Rika asked.
Sakura and Tomoyo blushed brightly.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t part of last night&#39;s plans.&quot; Tomoyo explained.
&quot;You mean it just happened?&quot; Naoko asked in amazement.
They blushed again.
&quot;Yeah.&quot;
The other girls giggled again.
&quot;What?&quot; Sakura asked.
&quot;You girls really were enjoying yourselves there.&quot; Rika grinned.
&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m half wishing I could feel what you girls felt.&quot; Chiharu 
said.
&quot;Jackpot!&quot; Tomoyo thought to herself. She approached Chiharu and moved 
her head closer.
&quot;Would you like to?&quot; she asked her softly.
Chiharu&#39;s face grew red. 
&quot;W-w-what?&quot; she exclaimed.
The others were dumbfounded at Tomoyo&#39;s words.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan? What are you saying?&quot; Sakura exclaimed.
&quot;I&#39;m just giving her a chance to experience it. Anyway, it&#39;s her 
decision.&quot; Tomoyo replied.
Chiharu was at a crossroad. What would she say? She wants to experience 
her first orgasm with Yamazaki but doing it with another girl seemed 
fun. They&#39;d keep it to their selves and no one would know.
&quot;I... sure I&#39;d like to but...&quot; 
&quot;But what?&quot; Tomoyo asked.
&quot;Rika-chan, Naoko-chan... what would you say?&quot; Chiharu asked them.
Rika and Naoko thought for a minute.
&quot;I&#39;d definitely would. It would be a totally new experience.&quot; Rika 
replied.
&quot;It seems like a very good experiment.&quot; Naoko replied.
Tomoyo smiled. 
&quot;Then it&#39;s settled.&quot;
She started to take off her bra and panties. Her breasts and pussy were 
in full view before them. The other girls were very excited and 
aroused. They stripped off their under wear showing off all they have.
Sakura was speechless and very aroused at the sight of four girls nude 
in front of her. Tomoyo reached out, shaking her shoulder.
&quot;Sakura-chan.&quot;
&quot;Eh?&quot;
Tomoyo smiled mischievously as she caressed her Sakura&#39;s hair.
&quot;You should undress too. No fair being clothe while the rest of us are 
naked and bear.&quot; she said to her seductively.
Sakura nodded absentmindedly and started to undress. She unzipped her 
dress, letting it fall to the floor. Tomoyo and the others watched her 
like a flock of vultures waiting for their prey. Sakura removed her bra 
showing her breasts, nipples very hard like pebbles. She removed her 
panties showing her bald and aroused pussy. Tomoyo made the first move, 
laying Chiharu and Naoko on their backs.
&quot;Sakura-chan, take care of Rika for me, would you?&quot; she asked.
&quot;Hmm? Okay.&quot; Sakura replied. She pushed Rika making her fall softly on 
the bed. She looked down at Rika with eyes slanted lustfully. Tomoyo 
smiled and started to pleasure the two. She first rubbed Chiharu&#39;s 
outer lips first. Chiharu moaned softly at Tomoyo&#39;s touch. Rika watched 
intently as Chiharu squirmed on the bed. Just then she felt something 
caress her sex. She looked down at herself and saw Tomoyo&#39;s finger 
gently stroking her outer lips. Sakura started to pleasure Rika. She 
took Rika&#39;s nipple and sucked on it. Her hand traveled to Rika&#39;s sex 
and started to rub it. Rika moaned feeling sensations she never felt 
before. She opened her legs, letting Sakura have her way with her. 
Sakura smiled at Rika&#39;s acceptance. She would not disappoint her. She 
rubbed a few more times then inserted her finger gently in Rika&#39;s 
girlhood. Rika moaned loudly feeling Sakura&#39;s finger inside her private 
spot. She moaned some more then bucked her hips, trying to increase the 
pleasure. Tomoyo also inserted her fingers inside Naoko and Chiharu. 
Chiharu gasped as she felt the silky finger penetrate her. Naoko 
whimpered at Tomoyo&#39;s touch. They bucked their hips too, begging Tomoyo 
for more. Tomoyo and Sakura started to pump deeper and faster into 
their friends waiting for their joyous reactions. Sakura smiled at 
Tomoyo remembering how much pleasure she felt at her hands. Tomoyo 
smiled back at her almost taking herself back to that night. She could 
almost feel Sakura&#39;s hands traveling all over her body, making her feel 
such pleasure. Chiharu, Rika and Naoko started to moan harder and 
louder, their cries becoming more frequent. Sakura and Tomoyo could 
feel their fingers get increasingly wet. As they pumped, their friends 
moved their hips along to increase the pleasure. Sakura was very much 
aroused as she felt Rika&#39;s love juices covering and layering her 
finger. Tomoyo was aroused as well at the sight of two girls whimpering 
at her touch. She wanted very much to feel the pleasure surging through 
their friends. Pressure was building inside of the girls and they felt 
it had to give. Sakura and Tomoyo felt their fingers being clenched 
hard. They smiled and knew their moment is nearing. They pumped harder 
and deeper determined to make their friends orgasm.
&quot;Oh! Oh! Takashi!!!!&quot; Chiharu screamed. She felt her body spasming. She 
grit her teeth and literally exploded her juices on Sakura&#39;s hand. 
Sakura slowly pulled her finger from Chiharu&#39;s pussy. Chiharu lay in 
Tomoyo&#39;s bed relishing her orgasm. Rika and Naoko saw Chiharu&#39;s 
release. They wanted very much to do that. Tomoyo didn&#39;t disappoint 
them as she pumped her finger even deeper. 
&quot;Ah! Ugh! Tanada-sensei!!!&quot; Rika cried out as she splashed out a stream 
of her hot girl cum all over Tomoyo&#39;s hand. Naoko wasn&#39;t far behind.
&quot;Ooooohhhh!&quot; Naoko moaned as she orgasm. She rose up from her high, 
squeezed herself for all she had and fell back exhausted. Tomoyo smiled 
mischievously as she pulled her fingers out of their sex. 
&quot;That was great, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; she asked her panting friends.
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; they tiredly replied.
&quot;I&#39;m glad I was a part of this.&quot; Sakura said as she stroked Rika&#39;s 
hair.
&quot;I told you they&#39;d enjoy our little game.&quot; Tomoyo replied.
&quot;That was really something...&quot; Chiharu panted.
&quot;You screamed Yamazaki&#39;s name. How touching.&quot; Rika snapped.
&quot;You screamed Tanada-sensei&#39;s name. We&#39;re no different.&quot; Chiharu 
retaliated. 
Naoko grinned at the two.
&quot;It&#39;s only natural to scream your loved one&#39;s name during an orgasm.&quot;
&quot;Really? I see.&quot; the others said.
They lay there for a few minutes, resting.
&quot;So, what do you girls want to do next?&quot; Sakura asked after a while.
Tomoyo grinned.
&quot;She&#39;s really asking what position you&#39;d like to be in.&quot;
&quot;Eh? Am not. How dare you turn the question around.&quot; 
&quot;So, what position would you like to be in?&quot; Tomoyo repeated the 
question bluntly.
&quot;What? Again?&quot; Rika exclaimed in surprise.
&quot;You girls know more about sex than we do. You call the shots.&quot; Chiharu 
said.
&quot;Well, we&#39;re open for suggestions.&quot; Sakura said.
&quot;How about a trib stance?&quot; Naoko spoke up.
&quot;Huh? A what?&quot; the others asked.
&quot;To demonstrate it, I&#39;ll need two of you.&quot; she said tiredly.
Sakura and Tomoyo volunteered. 
&quot;So, what&#39;ll we do?&quot; they asked.
&quot;You girls open your legs in a scissors position. Then move your 
pussies close to each other.&quot; Naoko directed.
They complied and got in to position.
&quot;Now what?&quot; Sakura asked.
&quot;Rub your pussies together.&quot;
Sakura and Tomoyo started to rub their pussies together. At first the 
pleasure was mild but when they grinded their pussies even harder, the 
pleasure increased. They stopped and looked at Naoko.
&quot;This is a great position but...&quot; Sakura started.
&quot;It takes two people to accomplish this and there are five of us.&quot;
Tomoyo observed.
&quot;You&#39;re right. One of us has to sit this one out.&quot; Rika agreed.
&quot;That one is I.&quot; Naoko said tiredly as she flopped on the bed. &quot;I&#39;m 
still spent so you girls go ahead.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;ll make it up to you later, Naoko-chan.&quot; Sakura said cheerfully.
Sakura and Tomoyo resumed the position while Chiharu and Rika 
positioned themselves. They slowly but surely grind their hips 
together. They cried out as they felt their clits rubbing against each 
other. The sensations they felt were really something else. They could 
really feel the heat of their partners&#39; pussy. The pleasure was 
unbearable but still they piston their pussies harder and harder, 
faster and faster. Naoko watched as her friends started to cry in sheer 
pleasure. Sakura was crying, tears slowly falling down her cheeks as 
she rubbed her pussy to Tomoyo&#39;s. Tomoyo grabbed and kissed her. She 
moaned inside Sakura&#39;s mouth and felt her firm nipples rub against 
Sakura&#39;s. Rika and Chiharu were enjoying their selves as well. Between 
rasps and screams were testimonials to rhythm and technique. The 
sensation was too much for Chiharu.
&quot;Ooooh! Rika-chan!!!&quot; Chiharu cried out as she exploded her pussy, 
gushing out her love juices. She came all over Rika&#39;s hips. Rika smiled 
as her friend sank after the orgasm. She looked tenderly at Naoko and 
beckoned to her.
&quot;Naoko-chan, your turn.&quot; she said sweetly.
Naoko smiled and complied. She opened her legs as Rika moved herself 
closer to Naoko, positioning herself.
&quot;Oh! Rika-chan!&quot; Naoko moaned as they humped their hips together. 
Chiharu smiled as she saw Naoko in pleasure. Rika held Naoko and sucked 
on her nipples as they kept rubbing against each other. Naoko squealed 
in delight as Rika stimulated her. She ran her hands all over Rika&#39;s 
body then held her hips forcing Rika even closer to her body. Sakura 
and Tomoyo in the midst of their pleasure, looked on happily as Naoko 
moaned and screamed for more of the pleasure. Then they humped even 
faster, increasing the pleasure. Rika moaned, Naoko whimpered, Sakura 
gasped and Tomoyo groaned as their moment races on. Then came the last 
straw. As they continued to rub against each other&#39;s pussies, they 
rubbed their tits. Tomoyo gave Sakura a sensuous kiss before screwing 
her eyes shut.
&quot;I&#39;m gonna cummm!&quot; Tomoyo moaned.
&quot;Yeahhh! Me tooo!&quot; Sakura whimpered.
Rika and Naoko felt their selves getting hot. 
&quot;Ooohhh! Rika-chan!&quot; Naoko was screaming in intense pleasure.
Chiharu smiled as she watched her friends near the edge, feeling what 
she felt a few minutes ago.
The four girls orgasm splashing their cum all over each other and on 
the bed sheets. The continued to hump each other, working off the last 
drops of their joint orgasm. The all sank on the bed as they lay there 
gasping and panting for breath.
&quot;Wow! That was indescribable.&quot; Naoko said, chasing her breath.
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Rika replied tiredly.
Tomoyo smiled as she cuddled Sakura feeling her lover&#39;s love juices on 
her thighs and sex. Sakura breathed heavily in Tomoyo&#39;s hold, relishing 
their release.
&quot;Let&#39;s do that again.&quot; Sakura said lazily.
&quot;Now you&#39;re the one asking for seconds.&quot; Tomoyo chuckled.
They giggled as they lay in each other&#39;s arms. Tomoyo looked down on 
the bed sheets and sighed. 
&quot;Oh no. I&#39;ll have to replace them again.&quot;
The others laughed as they also looked down on the bed sheets and 
seeing their cum all over it. They helped Tomoyo replace the bed 
sheets.
&quot;C&#39;mon girls, let&#39;s get cleaned up.&quot; Tomoyo said afterwards. They all 
kept giggling as they went in the bathroom. 
&quot;We should do this more often.&quot; Rika said as she splashed some water on 
Chiharu&#39;s body.
&quot;Yeah. How about my place, lets say, tomorrow?&quot; Chiharu said playfully.
&quot;Eh? Can&#39;t I have a day off?&quot; Sakura said in surprise.
Naoko laughed.
 &quot;No one&#39;s gonna know about this, right?&quot; Chiharu asked Tomoyo.
&quot;Secret&#39;s safe with me,&quot; Tomoyo replied, &quot;So, who wants to watch it?&quot; 
&quot;What?! Don&#39;t tell me you got it on tape.&quot; Sakura exclaimed.
Tomoyo just laughed.

That night, after taking their friends home,
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you taped that.&quot; Sakura said.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. Everything&#39;s fine.&quot; Tomoyo replied.
As they went inside Tomoyo&#39;s room, Sakura felt someone else was inside.
&quot;Tomoyo-chan, I think someone is in the movie room.&quot;
Tomoyo giggled.
&quot;I know. I bet mom&#39;s in there right now.&quot;
&quot;Eh?!&quot; Sakura exclaimed and rushed in the movie room. Sonomi sat in one 
of the cushions watching the &quot;candle light dinner&quot; tape. And she wasn&#39;t 
alone.
&quot;Dad!&quot; Sakura exclaimed in surprise upon seeing her father watching the 
video too.
&quot;Uh, dad let me explain.&quot;
&quot;No need, pumpkin. I know about everything.&quot;
&quot;You do? Are you mad?&quot; Sakura asked.
&quot;No I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just surprised though. Never thought I&#39;d have a 
lesbian for a daughter.&quot;
&quot;Is it okay with you, Kinomoto-san?&quot; Tomoyo asked.
Fujitaka chuckled uneasily and nodded.
&quot;Dad you&#39;re the greatest.&quot; Sakura said as she went to hug her father.
&quot;I should have been on my guard. Sonomi said not to be surprised but 
look at me.&quot; Fuji said.
&quot;Hmmm. What&#39;s this?&quot; Sonomi said curiously as she ejected the tape and 
popped in the other one. 
&quot;Oh no! Not that!&quot; Sakura exclaimed.
&quot;Aaaahhhh!&quot; Fujitaka and Sakura screamed as the video played.
&quot;Excellent.&quot; Sonomi said as she intently watched. 
Tomoyo laughed as she saw Fujitaka&#39;s expression. His eyes were as wide 
as saucers; his mouthed open and cocked to one side.
&quot;So this is why you want to stay so badly.&quot; Fujitaka regained himself.
Sakura was crimson red as she chuckled in sheer embarrassment.
