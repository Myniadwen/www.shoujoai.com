<h1>Tomoyo Daidouji's Unfathomable Heart</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dbenedict.html">Dennis Benedict</a><br> </h2>
<pre>FRIDAY:

     As I open the special &#39;memory&#39; chest and take out the eraser I am 
reminded ever so much more how I love her.  I can hardly believe it&#39;s 
been two years now.  We are both twelve and I am still unable to tell 
her I love her, I mean really love her.  I told her many times that I 
love her but she would always take it as a love between two best 
friends and return the love as such.  I wish I could find the courage 
to tell her that the love I have for her is that of a lover but the 
fear of ruining our friendship over it is to powerful.  I hug the 
eraser tightly to my chest for a few moments and then return it to the 
chest.  It was time to go to school.

     &quot;Hello Tomoyo-Chan&quot; Sakura said as she caught up with her.  
&quot;Hello Sakura-Chan&quot; Tomoyo responded with her usual radiant smile.  
&quot;Would you like to sleep over my house tonight Sakura?&quot;  Tomoyo asked 
with a hint of hope in her voice.  &quot;I would love to Tomoyo.  I really 
enjoy our sleep-overs.&quot;  Sakura responded with a smile that seems to 
glow brighter than the sun itself.  Tomoyo thanked her for accepting 
the invitation and by this time the two had arrived at school.  They 
both sat down in their desks and got ready for class to start.

     Tomoyo would catch herself staring at Sakura from time to time as 
she always did in the past.  Doing this would always give her a warm 
fuzzy feeling inside her that would always remind her of just how deep 
her love for Sakura really is.  &quot;I&#39;ve got to tell her that I love 
her.&quot; she thought to herself.  The day wore on and eventually school 
was closed for the weekend.

     &quot;Let&#39;s go get some ice cream Tomoyo-Chan.  My treat.&quot;  Sakura 
said as she gently took hold of Tomoyo&#39;s hand.  Tomoyo felt herself 
blush as Sakura took her hand saying, &quot;That sounds like fun 
Sakura-Chan.  But, you don&#39;t have to treat me.&quot;  Sakura placed a 
finger on Tomoyo&#39;s lips politely hushing her and said, &quot;I want to 
Tomoyo-Chan.  Please let me treat you to ice cream.&quot;  Tomoyo just 
smiled and told her alright.  This made Sakura very happy.

     When they finally arrived at the ice cream parlor Sakura bought 
two ice cream cones and proceeded to sit across from Tomoyo.  The two 
would eat some of their ice cream and then start talking about 
different things.  Sakura would notice that Tomoyo would blush a 
little from time to time.  She then said, &quot;Tomoyo-Chan, are you 
alright.  I notice your cheeks getting red every once in awhile.&quot;  
&quot;I&#39;m fine Sakura-Chan.  Sometimes my mind wonders off into personal 
feelings that tend to be a little embarrassing.  Thanks for worrying 
though.&quot;  Sakura giggled and responded with, &quot;Your welcome 
Tomoyo-Chan.  Besides, I know how you feel.  My mind does the same 
thing to me sometimes.&quot;  Both girls smiled at each other and giggled.  
They then finished up their ice cream and left the parlor.

     As they walked down the streets the two best friends eventually 
got to Tomoyo&#39;s house.  &quot;Is your mom home Tomoyo-Chan?&quot; Sakura asked.  
&quot;No she&#39;s not.  She won&#39;t be home till tomorrow.&quot; Tomoyo said in a 
somewhat sad voice.  &quot;Okay then.&quot; Sakura said. &quot;I need to go home and 
get my overnight supplies.  Then I&#39;ll come right back, Okay.&quot;  Tomoyo 
nodded with a smile and said, &quot;I&#39;ll be waiting.&quot;  With that Sakura 
rushed home and told her dad that she would be staying over at 
Tomoyo&#39;s house tonight.  Her dad nodded his agreement and said, &quot;Will 
you be eating there then?&quot;  &quot;Yes.  Her mom won&#39;t be home until 
tomorrow and I can&#39;t let my best friend eat by herself.&quot;  Sakura 
responded.  &quot;Tomoyo is so lucky to have a friend like you.&quot; her dad 
said.  Sakura thanked him for the compliment and went upstairs to pack 
her an overnight bag.

     She arrived at Tomoyo&#39;s house and rang the doorbell.  Seconds 
later Tomoyo opened the door and said, &quot;Hello Sakura-Chan.  I&#39;m so 
glad you decided to stay the night with me.  I get so lonely when my 
mom isn&#39;t here.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m happy to be here Tomoyo-Chan.&quot;Sakura said with 
her trademark smile that seems to warm up the entire mansion.  &quot;Have 
you eaten yet?&quot; Tomoyo asked Sakura.  &quot;Not yet.  I thought it would be 
fun to eat here with you.  Is that all right Tomoyo-Chan?&quot;  Sakura 
said with a cheery voice.  Tomoyo summoned all her might to keep from 
crying and managed to do so saying, &quot;It&#39;s perfectly alright 
Sakura-Chan.  I shall cook your favorite dish tonight.&quot;  Sakura smiled 
and blushed a little thanking Tomoyo for her kindness.  Of course 
Sakura couldn&#39;t see Tomoyo&#39;s bright red cheeks.

     As Tomoyo finished cooking their supper, Sakura helped her set 
the table.  The two then sat down at the table across from one another 
and at the same time said, &quot;Let&#39;s eat.&quot;  The two would converse a 
little while they ate.  Causing each other to blush a little at some 
of the things they talked about.  They continued eating when Sakura 
accidently rubbed against Tomoyo&#39;s feet with her own.  This paralyzed 
Tomoyo for a few seconds as her cheeks felt warm.  Sakura&#39;s cheeks 
also felt warm as she said, &quot;Um..I&#39;m...um...oh....um...sorry 
...um...Tomoyo-Chan.&quot;  &quot;That&#39;s...al..rig...ht Sakura-Chan.  
No...ne..ed to apologize.&quot;  Tomoyo shyly said.  Tomoyo had never felt 
so wonderful in her life.  Sakura&#39;s brief touch with her feet sent 
Tomoyo on a roller coaster ride of wonderful thoughts and feelings.  
If she had any doubts about her love for Sakura before, she knew she 
didn&#39;t now.  She wanted so much to reach across the table and give 
Sakura a kiss so intense that Sakura would have no choice but to love 
her back.  But she summoned all her might and suppressed that urge 
successfully.  The two remained pretty quiet after that and proceeded 
to finish their dinner.  Once done, they washed and dried their plates 
and proceeded to the den to watch some television.

     Time seemed to slowly chug along as if to allow those two to be 
together for as long as possible.  Eventually it became eight-thirty 
and Sakura suddenly said, &quot;I&#39;m getting sleepy.  What say we take a 
shower and go to bed.&quot;  Tomoyo blushed at the idea as she&#39;s done many 
times before when they would take a shower together.  She then 
responded with, &quot;Okay Sakura-Chan.  That sounds like a wonderful idea.  
I&#39;m getting a little sleepy myself.&quot;  With that said the two girls 
went upstairs to Tomoyo&#39;s room.  They removed their clothes and caught 
each other looking at one another.  They both blushed heavily and 
Tomoyo spoke up first with a shy voice saying, &quot;You are very pretty 
Sakura-Chan.&quot;  &quot;You are very pretty also Tomoyo-Chan.&quot; Sakura 
responded in an equally shy voice.  Well, once that was done the two 
proceeded to the bathroom and took a shower.  Ten minutes later they 
finished showering and while still naked went to the mirror and 
proceeded to fix their hair and brush their teeth.  Five more minutes 
went by and they went back to Tomoyo&#39;s room.

     &quot;Would it be alright if I slept in the nude Tomoyo-Chan?&quot;  Tomoyo 
blushed and told Sakura that it would be fine with her.  The two then 
got into Tomoyo&#39;s bed, laid down, told each other good night and went 
to bed.  Well, Sakura managed to go to sleep anyway.  Tomoyo was too 
nervous to get to sleep.  Her heart was pounding a mile a minute.  
Sakura was sleeping in the same bed as her and they were both naked.  
She wound up on her wonderful roller coaster again as she lay there 
facing her best friend.  &quot;She is just so cute when she sleeps.&quot; Tomoyo 
thought to herself.  She then, as quietly as possible, turned around 
so she was facing the opposite direction.  &quot;I WILL tell her my true 
feelings toward her.  I Will tell her tomorrow.&quot; She said to herself 
in a determined whisper.  Eventually, Tomoyo was finally able to drift 
off into a sound sleep.

------------------------------------------------------------

SATURDAY:

     Well, today is to be the day I tell Sakura just how much I love 
her.  I packed us a nice lunch and then headed for her house.  When I 
got there I noticed she was sitting on her front step waiting for me.  
&quot;Good morning Tomoyo-Chan.  Let&#39;s get going.&quot; Sakura said with a 
cheerful smile on her face.  &quot;Good morning Sakura-Chan.  Onward to 
Penguin Park.&quot; Tomoyo replied with an equally cheerful smile.  &quot;What 
am I afraid of?&quot; Tomoyo thought to herself.  This is Sakura.  Her best 
friend who is caring and always putting others before herself.  The 
two walked to the park enjoying each others company.

     When they finally reached the park Tomoyo sat the lunch basket on 
a picnic table and the two headed for the swings.  Tomoyo&#39;s heart 
started to race as she tried to figure out just how she was going to 
tell Sakura that she was passionately in love with her.  &quot;Umm, 
Sakura-Chan&quot; Tomoyo said in a low, shy voice.  &quot;What is it 
Tomoyo-Chan?&quot; Sakura responded with a little smile on her face.  
&quot;I....I mean....I...I love...you Sakura-Chan.  I love you as a lover.  
I&#39;m sorry if...&quot;  Tomoyo stopped talking when she looked at Sakura and 
noticed her smile had disappeared.  &quot;Sakura-Chan?&quot; Tomoyo said with a 
scared look on her face.  Sakura did not respond but only got up out 
of her swing.

     She walked in front of Tomoyo, grabbed her arms and forced her 
out of the swing.  &quot;You what?!&quot; Sakura said with a stern, hardened 
look on her face.  &quot;I&#39;m in love with you Sakura-Chan.  I&#39;ve been in 
love with you ever since we became best friends.&quot;  Tomoyo said 
nervously, not really looking directly at Sakura.  &quot;I thought that&#39;s 
what you said.&quot;  Sakura said with a fearful voice.  At this point, her 
anger had taken over and she punched Tomoyo right in the stomach.  
This sent Tomoyo into the ground gasping for air.  &quot;You 
disgusting....How could you even....I mean were both....What is wrong 
with you?&quot;  Sakura couldn&#39;t get full sentences out.  She was totally 
grossed out by her best friends confession.  
&quot;Sa..ku..ra..-Ch..an...Why di...OWW!&quot;  Before she could finish Sakura 
forcefully grabbed Tomoyo&#39;s hair and forced her to look up.  Tomoyo 
was crying heavily.  She knew that she had ruined her friendship with 
Sakura.  Still holding onto Tomoyo&#39;s hair painfully tight she said 
&quot;Don&#39;t you EVER call me Sakura-Chan again!  In fact don&#39;t even talk to 
me anymore, you disgusting, sick pervert!  We are no longer friends!&quot;   
Sakura then pushed Tomoyo&#39;s head back into the ground releasing her 
hair.  Hearing those words come from Sakura was equivalent to someone 
taking a really dull jagged knife and continuously stabbing her in the 
heart with it. Tomoyo was so heartbroken and full of tears she could 
not say or do anything.

     Sakura was about to walk away when she decided to do something 
that would shock everyone she knew.  She called for her Star wand and 
one of her Sakura cards.  Tomoyo managed to look at Sakura with her 
wand and card and couldn&#39;t help but wonder what card it was.  As 
Tomoyo struggled to stand up she heard Sakura as she released the 
card.  &quot;SWORD!&quot; Sakura had called the Sword and within mere seconds 
her Star wand became a deadly sword.  Tomoyo became extremely scared 
at this and slowly said, &quot;Sakura-Chan?!  Why?  What did I do to 
deserve such hate from you.  Plea...&quot;  Before she could finish Sakura 
ran up to her and punched her in the stomach again.  &quot;I told you not 
to call me that again!  It&#39;s time to end your pathetic life once and 
for all!  We don&#39;t need your kind around here!&quot;  All Tomoyo could do 
was curl up in a fragile little ball and cry.  Cry for the lose of 
their friendship, cry for making Sakura angry, and cry for being a 
&#39;screwed-up&#39; little girl.  &quot;GET UP!!&quot;Sakura demanded.  Tomoyo just lay 
their, still crying.  &quot;I SAID GET UP!!!&quot; Sakura yelled again as she 
kicked her.  Tomoyo was going through all the fear related emotions.  
Sadness, fear, nervousness, confusion.  She tried with all her might 
and courage to get up for Sakura, but she just couldn&#39;t do it.  She 
wound up laying face down in the ground.  &quot;Sakura-Ch..Sakura, please 
tell me why?&quot;  Tomoyo pleaded between tears.

	It hurt her so much that she couldn&#39;t say Sakura-Chan.  But she 
didn&#39;t dare make Sakura any more angry with her then she already was.

     Sakura just ignored her and said in a voice so frightening that 
the Fiery card would turn cold, &quot;I TOLD YOU TO GET UP AND I MEAN 
IT!!!!&quot;  &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; Tomoyo said in a weak, scared voice.  &quot;You hurt me 
to much.&quot;  She concluded and started crying really hard.  &quot;So be it 
then!&quot;  Sakura grabbed Tomoyo&#39;s hair and pulled her up by pure force.  
She then pushed her against the swing and called for her rope card to 
tie her to one of the poles.  Tomoyo was all but gone now.  She was 
crying so hard that she couldn&#39;t even feel her face.  Sakura again 
punched her in the stomach and said, &quot;Enjoy your eternal torment in 
hell you disgusting piece of garbage!&quot;  Tomoyo gathered all the 
courage she could to look up at Sakura and said, &quot;I still love you 
Sakura- Chan. I will always love you.  My only regret is that I hurt 
you so much.&quot;  With that Sakura thrust her sword all the way through 
Tomoyo&#39;s chest, making sure to penetrate her &#39;corrupt&#39; heart.......

     Tomoyo woke up totally soaked from sweat and fear.  She was so 
terrified at the nightmare that when she realized Sakura was sleeping 
in bed with her, she dashed out of bed with no clothes on, went to a 
corner, curled up into a little naked ball, and started crying.  
&quot;Tomoyo-Chan?!&quot; Sakura said as she woke up to her best friends crying.  
Tomoyo wasn&#39;t in bed and she couldn&#39;t see her best friend anywhere 
though she could hear her crying.  So she quickly got out of the bed 
and turned the light on.  She then spotted her best friend curled up 
in a corner and felt a few tears form in her own eyes.  Sakura walked 
over to Tomoyo and placed her hand on Tomoyo&#39;s head.  Before she could 
say anything Tomoyo got really scared, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Sakura-Ch....Sakura, 
Please don&#39;t hurt me.  Please forgive me.&quot;  She never looked up at 
Sakura as she said this.  Sakura&#39;s heart felt like it shattered into a 
million tiny pieces as she heard her friend say that.  &quot;Ever since we 
became friends she would always call me Sakura-Chan.  Now it&#39;s like 
she&#39;s afraid to and for some reason she is terrified of me.&quot;  Sakura 
felt more tears run down her cheek as she thought that to herself.  
She shook her head fighting back the tears.  Sitting down next to 
Tomoyo she began caressing her hair.  Tomoyo was obviously terrified 
remembering Sakura pulling her hair painfully in her nightmare.  
&quot;Tomoyo-Chan, I need you to calm down okay.  I am your best friend and 
I would never do anything to hurt you.  Nothing you could ever do can 
make me hurt and/or hate you.&quot;  Sakura continued stroking her friends 
hair.  After awhile it seems Sakura&#39;s kind words helped soothe 
Tomoyo&#39;s fears a little.  For the first time since the nightmare she 
was able to look up at Sakura.  Still unable to say anything she 
slowly uncurled herself from her ball state and slowly sat up against 
the wall.  She was still crying.  Sakura decided to give her a hug as 
best as she could.  She then kissed her on the cheek and said, &quot;I love 
you Tomoyo-Chan.&quot;  Tomoyo hugged Sakura back while still crying and 
shaking every so often saying, &quot;I love you too Sakura-Chan.  You are 
my best friend.&quot;  Tomoyo knew Sakura meant the friends type of love 
but oddly enough she didn&#39;t mind.  She was just happy that Sakura was 
there consoling her after her horrific nightmare.  Sakura&#39;s face lit 
up as she heard that.  &quot;You called me Sakura-Chan again.  That makes 
me so happy Tomoyo-Chan.&quot;  Sakura then took Tomoyo&#39;s hand into hers 
and said in a calm, almost motherly style voice, &quot;Now, would you like 
to tell me what on earth made you so scared of me.&quot;  Tomoyo thought 
about it for a minute and then decided to tell Sakura everything.  
Including her undying love for her.  Sakura could not hold back ay 
longer.  She grabbed Tomoyo and gave her the biggest compassionate hug 
that she possibly could.  She then busted out in tears.  &quot;Tomoyo-Chan.  
How....How could you ever think I could do that to you.  No wonder you 
were terrified of me.&quot;  Tomoyo then wrapped her arms around Sakura and 
the two began hugging each other for what seemed like forever.

     As Tomoyo felt tears form in her eyes again she said in a 
saddened voice, &quot;Sakura-Chan, is there something wrong with me?  I 
know were both girls but the love I feel for you is unmatched by 
anyone.  When I&#39;m with you I feel there is nothing that can harm me.  
Is it wrong to love you in this way?  Please tell me, Sakura-Chan.&quot;  
She then broke out into full fledged tears.  Sakura just continued to 
hug Tomoyo for a few more minutes and then broke the hug.  She then 
took Tomoyo&#39;s hands into hers and lifted her up as she lifted herself 
up.  She led Tomoyo to her bed and asked her to sit down.  Tomoyo 
complied wiping the tears from her eyes as she did so.  Sakura then 
went to her bag and pulled out a little fuzzy box.  She then returned 
to Tomoyo and while taking hold of her hands again got on one knee.  
&quot;Tomoyo-Chan, I hope that what I&#39;m about to say will answer all your 
questions.&quot;  Sakura nervously said.  &quot;Sakura-Chan?!&quot; Tomoyo said in a 
low, shy, nervous voice.  Sakura opened the little fuzzy box revealing 
a diamond ring, &quot;Tomoyo-Chan, I know this may seem that I&#39;m rushing 
things, but.....Will you marry me?&quot;  Tomoyo couldn&#39;t even remember her 
own name for a second let alone how to talk after hearing that from 
Sakura.  She was back on that wonderful roller coaster of hers.  When 
she was finally able to control herself again she responded in the 
happiest of voices, &quot;Sakura-Chan. Yes, Yes, a million times yes.  
Nothing in this entire universe would make me happier than to marry 
you.&quot;  Sakura was beaming with unsurpassed joy as she removed the 
diamond ring from the box and placed it on Tomoyo&#39;s finger.  Sakura 
then got up and kissed Tomoyo passionately on the lips.  Tomoyo kissed 
her back and Sakura couldn&#39;t help but notice a hint of puzzlement on 
Tomoyo&#39;s face.  Sakura easily fixed that by smiling while saying, &quot;So, 
even you can get puzzled.&quot; she giggled and continued, &quot;I realized I 
was in love with you about a year and a half ago Tomoyo-Chan.  Like 
you, fear kept me from saying anything.  So what if were both girls.  
We were finally able to tell each other that we loved one another 
thanks to that horrific nightmare of yours.  I am so looking forward 
to spending the rest of my life with you.  My dear, sweet, caring 
fianc&#130;.&quot;  &quot;Oh Sakura-Chan.&quot; Tomoyo said.  &quot;I love you so much.  I to 
am looking forward to our life together.  You have made me so happy.  
I shall cherish this ring forever.&quot;

     Tomoyo then crawled up into bed and lay face up in her pillow.  
Sakura quickly got the message and slowly crawled into bed on top of 
Tomoyo.  They gave each other a wonderful, passionate, warm kiss and 
proceeded to make love.  Neither one was nervous or shy about it.  
Neither one blushed.  They were truly in love and they were engaged to 
be married.  They were in their own little world, just the two of 
them.  After about an hour of sex they decided it was time to go to 
bed.  They maintained their loving embrace on one another knowing that 
they were not sleeping together as friends, nor were they sleeping 
together as just lovers.  No, they were extremely happy because they 
were sleeping together as an engaged couple and nobody was going to 
take that away from them.  &quot;I love you Sakura-Chan and good night.&quot;  
&quot;I love you to Tomoyo-Chan and good night.&quot;  They gave each other a 
kiss good-night and slowly drifted off into a place full of wonderful 
dreams, never releasing each other from their warm embrace.

Some notes on the story:

I was initially just going to make this one of Tomoyo&#39;s worst case 
scenarios but decided to make it a full blown complete mini story :)

I am a big fan of Cardcaptor Sakura and like many feel that Sakura and 
Tomoyo belong together :)

I would like to give a very special thank you to Clamp industries for 
bringing this wonderful anime series over here uncut on DVD :)

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the wonderful 
people that created Cardcaptor Sakura :)</pre>
