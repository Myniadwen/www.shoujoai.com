&quot;WHAT!? I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t hear you, hang on a moment!&quot; Tomoyo yelled 
into the phone over the distinct sounds of major construction.

&quot;There... that&#39;s better. Now, what were you saying?&quot;

Tomoyo and Sakura&#39;s lives were becoming quite hectic as of late, with 
renovations to their home to make room for the baby, and the almost 
impossible to keep up with demand for Daidouji clothes as of late. 
Sakura walked in the room and looked around at all the busy people 
working. Tomoyo noticed her and got concerned.

&quot;Hang on a moment please.&quot;

&quot;Sakura-chan! You shouldn&#39;t be in here! You don&#39;t have any safety gear!&quot;

&quot;But... but I...&quot;

&quot;No excuses, Out, Out.&quot; She says while guiding Sakura out of the room 
and gently patting her backside. Tomoyo sighed and turned her attention 
back towards her important phone conversation.

Sakura pouted and sat down on the couch to rest her feet. She wanted to 
help so much, but Tomoyo wouldn&#39;t have it. Well... that and the fact 
that she felt as big as a house didn&#39;t help either. 5 o&#39;clock rolled 
around and the workers left for the day while Tomoyo showered and got 
all the dirt and sawdust out of her hair. She came back out and sat next 
to Sakura on the couch.

&quot;Tomoyo-chan, why won&#39;t you let me help with anything?&quot;

&quot;Because I don&#39;t want you to get hurt. Construction can be dangerous and 
the last thing I want is for you to get injured.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that dangerous... is it?&quot;

&quot;See for yourself.&quot; Tomoyo said while showing Sakura a small cut on her 
arm.

&quot;I got this from just standing around and talking to the Contractor.&quot;

&quot;Are you ok? What happened?&quot;

&quot;A piece of metal from a pot-light fell down and hit me. I&#39;m fine, but 
you see what I mean?&quot;

Sakura kissed Tomoyo&#39;s wound and thanked her for always looking out for 
her safety. She looked deep into Tomoyo&#39;s stormy blue eyes and leaned in 
to kiss her lovely wife, Tomoyo&#39;s petal soft lips gently pressing 
against hers. Tomoyo felt Sakura&#39;s tongue pressing against her lips, 
politely asking to be let in. She obliged and parted her lips ever so 
slightly, feeling Sakura&#39;s tongue entwine with her own. They gently 
broke the kiss and Sakura started crying.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Sakura-chan? Why are you crying?&quot;

&quot;I... I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s stupid, I know.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not stupid. You are a very emotional girl. You don&#39;t like to keep 
your feelings to yourself, that&#39;s one of the things I love best about my 
little Sakura-chan.&quot; Tomoyo said while placing one hand on Sakura&#39;s 
cheek and wiping away her tears with her thumb.

Sakura blushed and tried her best to smile for Tomoyo.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m crying. Maybe it&#39;s because I feel so loved with 
you. Maybe it&#39;s because you make me happier than I have ever been in my 
life.&quot; Sakura said as more tears flowed down her cheeks and onto 
Tomoyo&#39;s hand.

&quot;Please don&#39;t cry Sakura-chan. It makes me sad to see you like this.&quot;

She gave her a hug and comforted her until she stopped crying.

&quot;Are you ok now?&quot;

&quot;Yeah... I&#39;m fine Tomoyo-chan. Thank you.&quot;

Neither girl was very hungry, so they decided to go to bed and skip 
dinner. Tomoyo helped Sakura get ready and climbed into bed, holding the 
Pregnant girl tightly to her chest. It didn&#39;t take long before both of 
them were out cold.
