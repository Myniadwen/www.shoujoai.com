<h1>Remastered II (part 10 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/remaster2-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&quot;Well kids it&#39;s December and you know what that means. Now as you all
know the Second Annual NamoCatCat Corp. Holiday Spectacular (raising
money for Tokyo&#39;s first Toys for Tots branch office) is coming up and the
mega fundraiser is featuring this school again as it&#39;s main
entertainment!&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Because your CHEAP!!&quot;

Misho&#39;s fur riles abit as she turns her cat like Neko eyes onto Keiko and
scowls at her.

Keiko - &quot;And giving me the &quot;evil eye&quot; won&#39;t cut it either, el cheapo!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;M NOT CHEAP!! I&#39;M TRADITIONAL!!&quot; (Misho huffs her breath) &quot;Lots of
businesses feature local schools in their events! IT&#39;S NOT BEING CHEAP!!
Last year Sakura&#39;s class partnered up with the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra
dammit! Is that cheap?&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Didn&#39;t they donate their time for the event and the whole thing
was a big tax write off for you---&quot;

&quot;Your just freaking evil, you know that?&quot; (Misho snarls as she turns back
to the board) &quot;This year we&#39;re doing a play---&quot; (&quot;Big surprise&quot;) &quot;---and
it&#39;s going to be---&quot; (&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;) &quot;---DO YOU MIND?!?&quot; (Misho
stomps her feet in anger) &quot;You want to prattle off then be my guest!&quot;

Keiko - &quot;No, no, not at all. Go on. Feel free. It&#39;s a free country and
all. Excessively free.&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;Speaking of cheap, have you done your shopping yet?&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Yeah, yeah. You know I did so shove off. I happen to like
shopping online for bargains! Do you mind you freak of nature you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah I mind---&quot; (Misho turns and regards Mr. Terada) &quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;N-nothing---&quot;

&quot;Then don&#39;t stare! It&#39;s rude!&quot; (clears throat) &quot;Alright. It IS Sleeping
Beauty BUT---&quot; (pauses for dramatic effect) &quot;---it&#39;s the Musical
version!&quot;

Misho - &quot;Not the Disney we&#39;re going to sing all the songs from the movie
version.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;And some new ones. As for the dream counterpart of the House of
Mouse? Disney just so happened to had needed a little financial bailout
(they always need financial bailout it seems) and I provided the bailout.
IN EXCHANGE they gave me the right to produce this musical (and get it
airtime on TV Tokyo) to the standards of the original animation! (amongst
other things they&#39;ve given me the rights back to...)&quot;

At that Keiko leans back in her chair, grinning from ear to ear like the
cat that ate the proverbial goldfish &quot;Well boys and girls, culture is
dying today -- weep for it.&quot;

&quot;OH F---&quot; (Misho stops herself short) &quot;---dry up.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;If only this was a lemon then you could cuss to your heart&#39;s
content.&quot;

&quot;If this was a lemon I&#39;d make you my bi---&quot; (Misho sighs) &quot;---let&#39;s just
pick the damn roles (I see everyone gawking at me so let&#39;s get this over
with). (And I loved the concert last year so up yours!)--- Kaho Mitsuki
recommended we play a drop and roll game---&quot;

&quot;Ladder game.&quot; Ms. Mitsuki corrected, only to be glared at by Misho. &quot;I
know that!&quot; (Misho growled) &quot;It&#39;s the same as the Neko Drop &amp; Roll game
so big deal it&#39;s a Ladder! Hmph. Just come up already and sign the paper
so we get this over with. And you two losers sign up too! We&#39;re short a
few roles so we need some filler ins for the roles, and I&#39;ll sign too.&quot;

As everyone signs their names Keiko watches Sakura sign, then signs the
board herself.

Rebecca follows Tomoyo, then turns to Keiko. &quot;Did you do it?&quot; Keiko
asked.

&quot;Forge Nina&#39;s name in Winterian? Yeah. You?&quot;

Nina - &quot;Eliza. In Winterian.&quot;

Both take their seats as Sakura walks up to Tomoyo after signing.

&quot;What roles you think we&#39;re going to get---&quot; (stops as Tomoyo hugs her)
&quot;I hope you&#39;re the princess this year! I want to make your outfit!! It&#39;d
be so beautiful!!&quot;

&quot;Tomo-chan---&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;Then we&#39;ll &quot;break it in&quot;! Oh goddess have I got a beautiful
Revolutionary Girl Utena sex fantasy to try out! You&#39;d be Utena, I&#39;d be
Anthy and GODDESS WHAT JOY!!&quot;

&quot;? ? ?&quot; (Keiko looks on confused as Tomoyo, in her mind&#39;s eye, slowly
drifts off and out of her range to communicate with her)
&quot;T-t-tomoyo--chan? Tomoyo? Hello?&quot;

Rebecca, watching the two, leans back in her chair. Casually she glances
over at Keiko. &quot;Think she knows that Tomoyo wants to make love to her in
her prince outfit like that?&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Uh... no, not a chance. She won&#39;t figure it out until they&#39;re in
bed doing it... goddess is this Utena hentai really that fun?&quot; (sighs) &quot;I
wanna be Utena too!&quot;

&quot;You two shouldn&#39;t be so wary.&quot; (Kaho)

Rebecca sighs miserably, turning her gaze over at the source of her
discontentment. &quot;Oh. It&#39;s YOU. The walking 8-ball. Somebody shake you
much today?&quot; (sighs again) &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll bite. Be wary about what? It&#39;ll
all be over soon?&quot;

Kaho - &quot;You&#39;ll see him again soon enough.&quot;

Both Keiko/Rena look at her oddly, then at each other. &quot;Back to your
seats.&quot;

Both turn away briefly--- sweatdropping, teeth clenched as one thinks
of---

Tomoyo - &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Nothing---&quot; Keiko responds quickly. &quot;Just nothing.&quot;

As the roles are read everyone watches.

Then---

* * * * * *

&quot;Again? Sakura&#39;s the prince AGAIN?!?&quot; Kero sighs, picking up his food
again and going back at it with vigor. &quot;You think they got over that one
last time, Sakura doing the whole dressing up as a prince thing that
probably inspired the creation of Utena and all but---&quot; (voiced in a
muffled eating way) &quot;Any difference this time out?&quot;

Tomoyo looked positively radiant about the decision, &quot;I&#39;ve made
improvements to the design! I was inspired by Lord of the Rings and
Revolutionary Girl Utena combined!! THIS WILL BE SO MUCH FUN!!&quot;

&quot;Well at least one of you is overjoyed.&quot; Nina remarks, poking at her own
food. &quot;Is this edible--- ouch! Eliza!&quot;

&quot;Behave. It tastes great, thank you Sakura.&quot; (Eliza eats a bite) &quot;So
whose the princess? There&#39;s no Syaoran Li this time so it must be
Tomoyo.&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;No. I&#39;m narrator again.&quot; (sighs) &quot;But I&#39;m going to be the
understudy so I&#39;ll have the chance to make my own princess outfit...&quot;
(smiles) &quot;...it&#39;ll be so Anthy-like!&quot;

Eliza - &quot;Then who---&quot;

Sakura fiddles with her fingers, looking rather distressed, then
finally---

&quot;Eliza.&quot;

Silence.

&quot;Hah hah... for a second there I thought you said MY Eliza is your
princess...&quot;

&quot;...yes...&quot;

Nina shakes her head. &quot;Can&#39;t be! We didn&#39;t even sign up for the thing, so
how can...&quot;

&quot;Keiko &amp; Rebecca forged your names, and Mr. Terada really needs the roles
filled so he didn&#39;t complain about it.&quot;

Nina faints, tumbling out of her chair with a loud thud.

&quot;Pity Keiko &amp; Rebecca didn&#39;t sign their own names.&quot; Eliza laments.

&quot;Well actually...&quot; Nina muttered from the floor.

* * * * * *

Meanwhile...

&quot;I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE SHE FORGED BOTH OUR NAMES IN NEKOCHANIAN!!!&quot;

Keiko spewed, her face scrunched up, as Eve gave her a backrub. &quot;Didn&#39;t
you two forge Nina &amp; Eliza&#39;s names in Winterian on the board?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s different! At least we didn&#39;t forge it in one sentence! I can&#39;t
believe she did it! And she even had the perfect solution for why our
names were in one spot, let alone in Neko! The evil thing!!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure.&quot;

&quot;She is evil!&quot; Keiko countered, &quot;She is! She--- your just saying that to
make me feel better.&quot;

&quot;----&quot;

&quot;---aw man---&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;It was decided by a ladder game!&quot; Sakura cried, looking rather
distressed.

&quot;IT SHOULDN&#39;T COUNT IF WE DIDN&#39;T SIGN IT!! (IT&#39;S EVIL!!) (And since when
do they allow participation signing through absentee representation?!?)&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;---never mind---&quot; Nina waved off Sakura&#39;s confused glances, &quot;But why
Eliza though? Why not Tomoyo? I mean that is such a given it should have
been her!&quot;

&quot;It was decided by---&quot;

&quot;A ladder game, yeah, yeah, I got that part---&quot; (Nina collapses onto the
table) &quot;---the part I&#39;m NOT getting is how we got shanghaied into this in
the first place!&quot;

Tomoyo was not put off by the turn of events, &quot;I&#39;m sure Eliza will be a
cute princess! I&#39;m going to make her outfit too! She is Sakura&#39;s partner
after all--- what&#39;s that noise?&quot;

Eliza motions at Nina, &quot;That&#39;s Nina&#39;s teeth grinding together, best not
mention the &quot;p&quot; word.&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;Sakura&#39;s partner?&quot;

(the grinding becomes louder)

Eliza - &quot;Yes, that. Please stop it.&quot;

Nina pounded her fists into the floor, &quot;Why couldn&#39;t she have gotten kids
from another class to fill vacancies!?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re all in the program in some capacity, Nina! There was no kids
left to pick! And Ms. Mitsuki chose the---&quot;

&quot;Chose the game to hand out the roles. Yeah, yeah, Sakura, I got that
part just fine thank you very much... I hate &quot;drop &amp; roll&quot;.&quot;

Sakura sweatdrops, &quot;What&#39;s Drop &amp; Roll, Nina?&quot;

&quot;Drop and Roll. Drop and Roll. The Nekochanian version of--- oh why the
hell do I bother having any form of intelligent conversation with YOU
anyway!!&quot; (Nina sighs as she glares at Sakura) &quot;I hate you.&quot; (silence)
&quot;But still, fair being fair and all it&#39;s inappropriate for a young woman
to be the romantic love partner of an older woman, even in a play, they
should have picked someone Sakura&#39;s age. She shouldn&#39;t be here.&quot;

Eliza turns towards Nina confused. &quot;Who shouldn&#39;t be here?&quot;

&quot;Ms. Mitsuki.&quot; Nina replied, &quot;The last time Ms. Mitsuki came into play
when the Cards were

originally loose she ended up being a catalyst for dreadful things to
come. I&#39;m just wary that she may be the bearer of similar bad tidings if
we&#39;re not careful. I don&#39;t want the same bad ending to come about as
before--- we have to be careful--- besides which I can&#39;t leave Sakura
alone with a mature woman, her hormones will spin out of control!&quot;

Sakura - &quot;WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!?&quot;

&quot;Eliza is a enchanting woman and a beautiful goddess to behold--- and
your weak minded.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;It&#39;s JUST A PLAY!! AND I&#39;M NOT WEAK MINDED!&quot;

&quot;Sakura can&#39;t keep her hands off of Eliza&#39;s curves.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;NO I&#39;M NOT GOING TO DO THAT--- YOU JUST WANT TO FIND NEW WAYS
TO TORMENT ME DON&#39;T YOU!!&quot;

&quot;You betcha!&quot; (laughs uncomfortably)

Tomoyo comforts Sakura as Eliza raps Nina across the head again (to get
her to behave).

* * * * * *

So, as the days passed everyone rehearsed, and rehearsed, and rehearsed.

Incidents broke out, some people deadpanned their performance (saving
their real potential for the stage) and others didn&#39;t show up at all
(Keiko had to be dragged to rehearsal by Eve each and every day)).

Finally, the night of the performance came and everyone was ready...
almost.

&quot;I wish they did the concert thing again.&quot; Keiko sighed irritably. &quot;I&#39;d
even play an instrument if it meant ditching this play idea.&quot;

&quot;Well it&#39;s too late now so you&#39;ll have to bear through it.&quot; Eve whispers,
leaning against Keiko&#39;s body as she does. &quot;They&#39;ll be great.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;It&#39;s not them I&#39;m worried about.&quot;

&quot;Sigh.&quot;

* * * * * *

Meanwhile, in the audience.

Gaia - &quot;It&#39;s too cold. Where&#39;s the main central heating?&quot;

Umi - &quot;Probably shut off. You know how cheap Misho is---&quot; (&quot;I&#39;M NOT
CHEAP!!&quot;) &quot;---anyway it&#39;s almost time for Mistress Sakura&#39;s performance.
Hope it&#39;s heartwarming... mostly since the liquids in my body are freezing
into the consistency of jello in here. It&#39;s like the time she

captured me all over again, I didn&#39;t like that one bit... don&#39;t like it
now.&quot;

Gaia - &quot;Too bad about Mistress Sonomi. I wish she could have been here.&quot;

Umi - &quot;She gave me one of Mistress Tomoyo&#39;s cameras to film with so I&#39;m
ready to go. (she wanted to come too, too bad) Anyway, Mistress Sakura&#39;s
class is next.&quot;

Gaia - &quot;What is Mistress doing?&quot;

Umi - &quot;Something about a beauty that sleeps a lot. Sleeping Beauty---
think it&#39;s a case of sleeping sickness but who can say with these
misrepresented tales of the good old days.&quot;

Gaia - &quot;They were actually good?&quot;

Umi - &quot;Please don&#39;t push me out of my happy space... goddess, it&#39;s freezing
in here!&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;It&#39;s almost curtain time!&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Big deal, I ouch! Eve!&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;Whatever.&quot;

&quot;Geez!&quot; Misho growls, walking amongst the group, &quot;You&#39;d think some of you
were going to your own funerals the way your moping about!&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Can I go to my own funeral? It&#39;d be better than this. At least
it&#39;d be catered.&quot;

Rebecca - &quot;Bury me now (catering or not), my acting debut is done.&quot;

&quot;CUT IT OUT!!&quot; (sighs) &quot;Just go out there, break a leg (it&#39;d be an
improvement for some of you) because we have a VERY LARGE audience to
please--- not to put too much stress on you because you know it&#39;s being
televised, right?&quot;

&quot;Oh, sure, heaven forbid the pressure get cranked up NOW.&quot; Keiko scoffs.
(Not amusing Misho in the slightest as she gives Keiko a brief dirty
stare before going back to her speech, &quot;Just as long as we don&#39;t talk
about you know... that. Don&#39;t talk about it and we&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;About what?&quot; Everyone shrugs, confused to what she was talking about.

&quot;Hamlet! Your not supposed to talk about Hamlet before a performance
because it&#39;s bad luck! (Don&#39;t any of you know anything about the arts?!?)
That&#39;s why nobody before a play talks about Hamlet because talking about
Hamlet is bad luck and---&quot; (silence) &quot;---that didn&#39;t

count. That rant about Hamlet didn&#39;t count (or that reminder). Just don&#39;t
talk about it after now. OK? OK--- now if nobody needs me for anything
I&#39;m going to go drown a puppy or something equally constructive.&quot; (walks
off in a huff)

As Sakura enters backstage a lot of wows and oohs follow her.

&quot;Sakura! You look majorly hot!&quot; someone calls out.

&quot;Hmmm--- a cross between a musketeer and Aragorn from LotR--- not bad.
Cute actually---&quot; Keiko remarks. &quot;I guess that means the princess is
going to look like what&#39;s her name?&quot;

&quot;Where&#39;s the princess?&quot; Rebecca asks, drawing everyone&#39;s attention to
look about. As they look, Keiko takes a brief peek behind her and quickly
turns around. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Keiko?&quot;

&quot;I just saw Terada and Rika kissing, Eve.&quot;

&quot;---?---&quot;

&quot;Not just kiss-kiss. I mean romantic, full out tongue action lover&#39;s
kiss-kiss. If this wasn&#39;t already pre-guaranteed that I never have to
find out about that kind of action in the merry land of Sakura I&#39;d swear
he was craving a little Rika for after the show! (Sorta like Innocence
from Icarus Publishing but hopefully not in the bad way).&quot;

Eve - &quot;They&#39;re married so it&#39;s OK. They&#39;re allowed to be as lemony as
they want.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Well sure if you put it that way and they&#39;re---say what---&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Rika? You&#39;re all red---&quot;

Sakura, an actress in need of a clue to purchase. Keiko, in need of a
sponge to clear the last thought Eve put into her head (and an
explanation about what Eve just told her).

&quot;Where&#39;s Princess Eliza?&quot; (Chiharu)

&quot;I&#39;ve been wondering that myself---&quot; (Rebecca)

Keiko - &quot;Tomoyo must have finished her costume by now.&quot;

Eve - &quot;She did. It took her a few days to finish it. She&#39;s putting it on
Eliza now.&quot;

&quot;---nNO!! No! No! NO!!&quot;

Silence as everyone turns towards the dressing area. With slight
trepidation in her steps, Sakura goes to investigate., peeking behind the
curtains. &quot;WOW!!&quot;

Both Tomoyo &amp; Eliza were dressed in identical costumes. &quot;I&#39;m not so sure.
I mean, I feel like I&#39;m betraying Nina--- and sure you&#39;ll be my
understudy if I collapse or something, and that&#39;s OK and all, but what&#39;s
with this wig? It&#39;s uncomfortable and I already have blonde hair. And
this costume feels all awkward (snug like a glove but still)--- I don&#39;t
know!! Can&#39;t you take my place now? This is making me sick to my
stomach!!&quot;

(Tomoyo&#39;s not listening because she&#39;s entirely satisfied with her work)

&quot;That&#39;s so cute!!&quot;

Eliza scowls at Sakura, &quot;Only Nina can say that about me, Sakura!!&quot;
(storms for backstage) &quot;I quit. Tomoyo&#39;s all dressed up so she can be me!
(Knew getting her to make that costume was a good idea!)&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;But it looks good on you.&quot;

Eliza snarled at the thought, &quot;So does a certain brand of gum according
to commercials I&#39;ve seen but THAT&#39;S NOT THE POINT! The point is I feel
awkward being romantic to Sakura! She&#39;s your lover, you be the princess!
The only &quot;prince&quot; I want to kiss won&#39;t even be near me! Take my place!&quot;

Tomoyo shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m the narrator.&quot;

Eliza - &quot;---&quot; (?) &quot;So I&#39;ll narrate! Let&#39;s swap places! You&#39;re my
understudy anyway, and I don&#39;t like wearing this! It&#39;s all fluffy and I&#39;m
going to fall on my face walking in this, and it&#39;s not like talking is
such a big deal! Why do I have to wear this?&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;Because you&#39;re the princess.&quot;

Eliza didn&#39;t like that answer one bit, &quot;I didn&#39;t ask to be anything in
this play! I just quit. Nobody can make me be the princess because I
didn&#39;t sign up for this in the first place so being signed in against my
will doesn&#39;t count.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Pwhee?&quot;

Eliza pointed at the door in a rage, &quot;I quit. There. Is that simple
enough for you to grasp? Me Quitee Now. Phht.&quot; (with that Eliza turns to
walk off (again)), but not before Tomoyo stops her with her one
weakness). &quot;Really? That&#39;s too bad. I know Nina is in costume and she
wouldn&#39;t do it unless you were in the play. She&#39;d feel rather betrayed if
you were to suddenly ditch and leave her in the play all alone and---&quot;

&quot;---your evil---&quot; (with that Eliza turns and walks right back into the
play with the others cheering her on) &quot;I hate it when she uses Nina
against me.&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;Is it starting?&quot; Gaia cried out numbly, &quot;(My hands are beginning to go
numb from the cold!)&quot;

&quot;Clap often, it&#39;ll keep the blood circulating.&quot; (Umi holds the camera up)
&quot;Good thing this unit has a heating device and compensates for vibrations
and jitters.&quot;

Gaia - &quot;Heating unit? Really? Let me shove that camera down my top during
intermissions, maybe my panties too if it&#39;ll fit--- I&#39;m freezing my
pedals off!&quot; (sighs miserably) &quot;How can they do this in such a cold
climate!&quot;

* * * * * *

Tomoyo&#39;s voice boomed loud as the lights dimmed and the narrative began.

&quot;Once upon a time, a King and his Queen lived in a castle...&quot; (musical
sting, followed by projected images from the animated movie) &quot;For a long
time they had wished for a child...&quot; (another musical sting and more
images)

&quot;That&#39;s Mistress Tomoyo.&quot; (Gaia whispers) &quot;I&#39;m going to ask her for a
thermal insulation heated formal dress for Christmas, somebody should
have put &quot;winter wear&quot; instead of &quot;formal wear&#39; on the invitation! Damn
them.&quot;

The curtain opens on royal court (same cast as last time this play was
done in same roles with the exception of a bodyguard (played by Rena and
one male who used to be a fairy which was now played by Eve, who stood a
head/shoulders taller over the other two fairies as they

walked in))

&quot;Finally a princess was born. They named her Princess Aurora. The King
and Queen rejoiced her birth and held a great banquet---&quot; (&quot;If this is a
banquet where&#39;s the food---&quot; Rena sighed under her breath, stomach
rumbling slightly) &quot;---All of the people in the country celebrated the
birth of the princess.&quot;

&quot;Look at me! I&#39;m festive!&quot; Keiko whispers, looking rather odd.

Misho sighed irritably, &quot;That&#39;s cute, &quot;Ed&quot;. Will you ever disappoint me?&quot;

&quot;Yes I will...&quot; (?) &quot;...is it me or do the props look ultra real?&quot;

Misho sighed as she lightly motioned about the stage with her free hand,
&quot;Holosystem onstage for ultra real effects. It&#39;ll really pay off with the
grand finale.&quot;

&quot;What do you---&quot; (Misho walks off before she can question her further).
&quot;---whatever.&quot;

Narrator (Tomoyo) - &quot;Not only the people, but the fairies as well, came
to with the princess well to celebrate her birth.&quot;

&quot;One obviously playing part time for the WNBA.&quot; Nina remarks from her
spot off stage.

Fairy #1 (Chiharu) - &quot;We celebrate the birth of Princess Aurora from the
bottom of our hearts.&quot;

Fairy #3 (Naoko) - &quot;We would like to give the princess our gifts.&quot;

Musical Number - The Birth of the Princess.

Nina - &quot;?&quot; (looking at script) &quot;Where did this come from?&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Already? We&#39;re barely out the gate and a musical number kicks
in?&quot; (sighs) &quot;I&#39;m going online to play World of Warcraft for awhile, let
me know when the singing stops and my ears stop bleeding.&quot;

* * * * * *

A few minutes later---

Fairy #1 (Chiharu) - &quot;I give you beauty worthy of the shimmering northern
aurora that gives you your name.&quot;

Fairy #2 (Eve) - (smooth as silk voice) &quot;I give you a beautiful voice to
rival the songbirds...&quot;

Fairy #3 (Naoko) - &quot;I give you---&quot;

Laughter, as all eyes turn to the back of the auditorium.

There, in costume and in role, was Yamazaki. Next to him, dressed as a
cross between---

&quot;Sailor Saturn &amp; the grim reaper?&quot; (Misho)

&quot;Somebody&#39;s been working Tomoyo overtime it seems.&quot; (Keiko)

---was Nina, holding a menacing weapon similar to Sailor Saturn---

&quot;That&#39;s DeathScyther.&quot; (Keiko)

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s DeathScyther, Misho, remember? The prop weapon used by Trooper
Saturn during the recently revivied Sailor Troopers storyline. It never
saw the light of day until recently, but that&#39;s it alright.&quot;

Witch (Yamazaki) - &quot;Such a grand party, but it seems I did not receive an
invitation---&quot;

Henchbeing (Nina) - &quot;Most unfortunate... for them.&quot;

Fairy #1 (Chiharu) - &quot;Who would invite an evil witch like yo---?!&quot;

(Nina shoves out DeathScyther menacingly, glaring at Chiharu as she did),
&quot;Shut your yap, loud mouthed little pixie!&quot; (Yamazaki reaches out and
pulls down the weapon abit as he speak) &quot;An evil witch?&quot; (catches Nina&#39;s
attention) &quot;Now who could that be?&quot;

Silence, then the two start walking to the stage, the rhythmic clik-clak
of DeathScythe

striking the cold floor as Nina walked forward the only sound to be
heard.

Guard 1 (male) (whisper) - &quot;Yamazaki&#39;s really getting into it, isn&#39;t he?&quot;

Guard 2 (Rebecca) (whisper) - &quot;He&#39;s freaking me out... Nina&#39;s freaking me,
too.&quot;

Witch (Yamazaki) (the two have now entered the stage, DeathScyther still
clacking against the flooring as Nina walks forward one step behind
Yamazaki) &quot;I thought my invitation might have been misplaced.&quot;

Queen (Rika) - &quot;We are so sorry. But we had heard that you didn&#39;t like
parties---&quot;

Witch (Yamazaki) - &quot;True, oh so very true. I do so hate parties, but...
then again... I hate being ignored that much more than I hate parties.
Agreed?&quot;

Henchbeing (Nina) - &quot;Of course. It&#39;s as if they don&#39;t respect your power,
Mistress.&quot;

Guard 2 (Rebecca) (whisper) - &quot;Nina calling someone &quot;Mistress&quot;, now
there&#39;s a twist.&quot;

Guard 1 (male) (whisper) - &quot;Yamazaki&#39;s good at acting like a girl.&quot;

Guard 2 (Rebecca) (whisper) - &quot;Mind your manners.&quot;

Witch (Yamazaki) - &quot;The precious princess finally born to this country.
Let me give you a gift too.&quot; (silence as a lone spotlight falls on
Yamazaki and the baby&#39;s resting place, the audience hushes and listens
aptly to every word) &quot;You will be beautiful, noble and kind. Loved by the
people of the country, you will know happiness--- until you turn 16! ON
YOUR SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY, PRINCESS AURORA WILL PRICK HER FINGER ON A
SPINDLE--- AND DIE!!!&quot; (loud thunder, loud strains of music)

Rebecca chuckles softly, nudging the male guard next to her, &quot;Heh, heh,
he said &quot;prick&quot;.&quot;

&quot;STAY YOUR PLACE!!&quot; (Nina swings DeathScyther about, inches from
Rebecca&#39;s throat, her face filled with a frightening darkness. As the two
backed off stage, only Yamazaki&#39;s laughter could be heard). &quot;Sheesh...
somebody&#39;s overwound.&quot;

Meanwhile, back in the audience.

&quot;Why was the evil witch a guy? (Nina being his henchbeing was scary too,
and Eve is just too big to be a believable fairy).&quot; Umi remarked.

&quot;It was rather interesting though, huh? (the witch was my favorite!)&quot;

Both Eliza (off stage) and Chiharu are in shock, as for Eliza it&#39;s
because for all the time she&#39;s been with Nina she&#39;s never seen her like
that before. Rebecca takes a deep shaky breath, whispering silently &quot;Good
thing I&#39;m wearing protection--- man that was disturbing.&quot;

&quot;HOW COULD SHE?!&quot; (Chiharu, giving Rebecca a second shock nearly sending
her backwards into a row of party guests) &quot;Don&#39;t do that!!&quot; Rebecca
hisses, &quot;I&#39;m not a well woman right now!&quot;

&quot;Princess Aurora will die---&quot; (Rika)

&quot;Is there no way to remove the witch&#39;s curse?&quot;

Fairy #3 (Naoko) - &quot;I still haven&#39;t given the princess my gift.&quot; (silence
at all eyes focus on her) &quot;On her 16th birthday, Princess Aurora may
prick her finger on a spindle, but she will not die. She will only sleep.
The kiss of true love will break the evil spell, and awaken her from her
sleep.&quot;

Curtain closes, act ends.

&quot;That was great... it warmed my nearly frozen heart (and vital organs)&quot;
Gaia mumbled half cold, &quot;...but I didn&#39;t see Mistress anywhere. Where was
she?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll be along soon, Gaia, she said she would be.&quot; Umi assured her,
trying to keep her warm.

* * * * * *

&quot;Is there any sanctuary from the musical numbers here?&quot; Keiko said as she
stepped into the narrator&#39;s booth, &quot;Not all of them are being sung by
someone as good as Tomoyo you know, and my therapist warned me against
further trauma this week. She said something about it being bad for my
mental health and all that.&quot;

&quot;Come in, come in.&quot; Jack said, motioning for her to sit as they prepared
for the next scene, the musical number in the forest was already underway
below them. &quot;Eliza didn&#39;t want to do the singing parts so Tomoyo ran down
to do the forest musical scene.&quot; (looks on) &quot;She sings beautifully,
doesn&#39;t she.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Keiko agrees, &quot;I can see why Sakura is so in love with her. A
great deal of the things she does she does beautifully.&quot; (sighs as she
leans back in her chair) &quot;So how long before we see Eliza step out?&quot;

&quot;Shortly.&quot;

&quot;Tomoyo does a bang up job as announcer, right---&quot; (thoughts) &#39;And Kero&#39;s
hanging with Tomoyo because Nina said her singing was one of the reasons
he came.&#39; (pauses before she notices Jack watching her) &quot;Keiko---
anything else?&quot;

A long awkward silence follows, until finally he motions for Keiko to say
what&#39;s on her mind.

&quot;Why did Catherine show up? I thought you were---&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not supposed to be involved, remember? No Raven intervention.&quot;

Keiko shook her head, looking at him sternly. &quot;She&#39;s a Raven, and she&#39;s
intervening. Is that supposed to be so right while your so wrong?&quot;

&quot;Not the way you think.&quot; (Jack turns away for a second to regard Keiko)
&quot;I keep out of everyone&#39;s way and watch from the background. Catherine
keeps an eye on things while in the glaring light of scrutiny, and in
turn is watched while she keeps the spotlight off me.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;So she&#39;s supposed to be in everyone&#39;s face so you can act with
impunity while she gets the attention drawn to her. That your idea?&quot;

Jack - &quot;You know it wasn&#39;t my idea. It was her&#39;s and I&#39;m beginning to
suspect the same as you about her involvement in this situation.&quot;

Silence. Then Keiko asks the obvious.

&quot;She&#39;s not over it--- is she?&quot;

Jack shakes his head, &quot;Remember the end battle against him?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not over it.&quot;

Keiko leaves after Tomoyo&#39;s stirring performance, Jack leaves two minutes
later.

* * * * * *

Downstairs Sakura grabs a brief second to hug Tomoyo, &quot;That was
beautiful!&quot;

&quot;Thanks. I worked hard on getting the song just right---&quot; (hugs Sakura
back) &quot;I have to go soon, it&#39;s almost time for the next act and I&#39;m
needed upstairs.&quot;

Sakura, however, wouldn&#39;t let go. &quot;Why couldn&#39;t you be my princess?&quot;

&quot;Oh Sakura-chan.&quot; (the two kiss) &quot;I&#39;ll always be your princess. You know
that.&quot;

&quot;Tomo-chan---&quot; (her hands touch Tomoyo&#39;s face) &quot;It won&#39;t be the same.&quot;

&quot;Just think of me and I&#39;ll be there in your heart when you give that
special kiss. But just to hold you over until my prince is in my arms
again...&quot; (one more kiss, softly and slowly savoring each and every second
they&#39;re together) &quot;I have to go. Good luck.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

The two reluctantly part, each going their separate ways.

* * * * * *

Tomoyo&#39;s narrative continued.

&quot;Returning to the kingdom on her sixteenth birthday, and safe in the
knowledge that all the spinning wheels in the kingdom was destroyed, the
King &amp; Queen were reunited happily with their daughter who was held in
hiding as a simple but happy village girl. Their daughter, as

predicted, grew to be both wise and beautiful, noble and kind.&quot;
(whispering to Kero) &quot;She&#39;s on.&quot;

King - &quot;Princess Aurora.&quot;

Eliza, being shoved out by her &quot;co-stars&quot;, stumbles onto stage. She spins
around to come face to face with Nina (holding DeathScyther) as she
smiles at Eliza. &quot;Go on! Your beautiful! Go get them!&quot;

&quot;Then don&#39;t threaten me with that thing if you&#39;re so confident in me.&quot;
Eliza sighs, gritting her teeth she spins on her heels and goes into
action, slowly her enthusiasm shoots right through her like rapid fire
uppers as she begins to get her momentum as she approached the King and
Queen. Quickly she stops, curtsies, and delivers her line perfectly.
&quot;What is it father, mother?&quot;

That would have been excellent, perfect pitch, tone and delivery.
Everything perfect.

Except she delivered the line in Amazonian, not common, which baffled
everyone.

&quot;What is she saying?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s saying everything in Amazonian.&quot; Nina sighs, &quot;Oh, did I forget to
mention she tends to start rattling on in Amazonian if she&#39;s highly
strung out on nerves and adrenaline or having a panic attack? She does
that, you know, yes she does...&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;She looks great. Really, she looks great.&quot; Kero noted, eye cocked in a
rather vulcan like manner, &quot;I have no idea what she&#39;s saying though, but
she does look great.&quot;

Tomoyo nods her head, &quot;I worked hard to make it look right. Nina&#39;s
costume was easier, and Sakura&#39;s was a labour of love. My costume was
easiest because I just copied Eliza&#39;s. Eliza&#39;s was the hardest. She is
Sakura&#39;s...&quot; (blinks) &quot;...somebody&#39;s going to tell her she&#39;s talking in a non
common language soon, won&#39;t they?&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;Why are your teeth grinding, Nina?&quot;

&quot;I dunno... maybe someone&#39;s saying something about me. or Eliza, or the
both of us.&quot;

* * * * * *

King - &quot;Uh... Princess Aurora...? Today is your 16th birthday. Is there
anything you want?&quot;

Keiko (off stage/whisper) - &quot;A universal translator, perhaps?&quot;

Nina (off stage/whisper) - &quot;Shh!&quot;

Princess Aurora (Eliza) - (translated from the Amazonian since somebody
got the theater&#39;s translator programming in the speaker systems up and
running)

&quot;No! Elder! I want nothing more than for you and Mistress to be healthy
and for our land to be at peace!&quot;

Nina (off stage/whisper) - &quot;Oops. Forgot. Amazonians (being one
multi-gender) don&#39;t have words for Mother or Father -- ouch.&quot;

Queen (Rika) - &quot;Darling Princess Aurora...? Tonight we will have a birthday
party for you. Please change for it.&quot;

Princess Aurora (Eliza) - (Amazonian) - &quot;Yes mistress!!&quot; (realizing she&#39;s
talking in Amazonian she quickly storms off the set to try and calm down)

* * * * * *

&quot;That was rather awkward and odd at the same time. Made me see parenting
in a whole new light, oh yeah--- definitely.&quot; Kero mutters, watching
Eliza escape to the safety of off stage. &quot;She panicked in the middle of
ther performance! What an &quot;ace&quot; she is--- not.&quot;

Narrator (Tomoyo) - &quot;Princess Aurora returned to her room--- where she
saw what was thought to be eliminated from the land---&quot;

Princess Aurora (Eliza) - (Amazonian) - (Nina didn&#39;t have enough time to
calm her down) - &quot;My! What is that!?&quot; (she charges forward hand held out)

Narrator (Tomoyo) - &quot;Princess Aurora had never seen a spinning wheel
before. Think--&quot;

&quot;OUCH!&quot;

Nina - &quot;ELIZA WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?&quot;

(Eliza looks at her hand, the gush of blood, and faints dead away, hand
bleeding)

Nina - &quot;AW DAMN! MEDICO!! DAMN SHE CUT A BLOOD VEIN? GOD THERE&#39;S SO MUCH
BLOOD!! WILL SOMEBODY GET A MEDICO KIT--?&quot;

&quot;Never mind---&quot; (Tomoyo blushes)

* * * * * *

Meanwhile, back in the audience.

Umi - &quot;Uh... is that supposed to happen?&quot;

Gaia - &quot;Did she kill herself? That&#39;d be a sad ending if she killed
herself.&quot;

After the obligatory villain appearance (Nina too distraught to play her
role as she mended Eliza&#39;s hand) the curtain fell close (for mending of
the actress) and she&#39;s set up for the sleeping scene. Another musical
number takes place, everyone is put into a deep sleep,

and the play moves on--- however---

&quot;They&#39;re engaged you know.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Rebecca looks over at Keiko as if she just announced that there
was actually going to be a real physical sun in the sky and it&#39;d come up
tomorrow. &quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;The two handmaidens who slumped on each other at the sleeping scene.
They&#39;re engaged.&quot; Keiko points out as the two went off stage hand in
hand.

&quot;How&#39;d you know that (other than the whole hand holding thing)? Spill,
Keiko,it&#39;s not just because of---&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Remember the Lunarian festival? I saw those two paired off
during an &quot;engagement&quot; ceremony at the temple where they swore their love
and exchanged their blessings.&quot;

Rebecca frowns. &quot;That isn&#39;t the mucho kinky Lunarian festival ritual
where they strip naked and then do a mass orgy thing, right?&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s it. I was renewing my vows with Eve when I saw
them.&quot;

Rebecca slaps her head on her forehead. &quot;Sheesh. Some of us actually were
too busy doing the ceremony to notice who was around us--- (I saw you
there though, and it wasn&#39;t hard since you required a clothing mistress
AND a weapons master to take your stuff--- at least I left my weapons at
home!)&quot;

&quot;First time, eh? Not that it matters since guns aren&#39;t allowed on the
temple grounds on normal days let alone festival days, anyway I noticed
you were given the first timer speech and---&quot; (beep beep beep be--) &quot;Is
it time? It&#39;s time?&quot; (Keiko stands up) &quot;Duty calls. See ya&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Whatever---&quot; (the two walk by, holding hands and looking cuddly
together) &quot;---sheesh, she was right, they do look rather close---&quot; (sighs
again) &quot;Now I&#39;m becoming noisy like her. Sheesh. Evil thing.&quot;

* * * * * *

The Drama Continues---

Narrator (Tomoyo) - &quot;The days passed...&quot; (a light shines down on a
&quot;countryside&quot; scene with Sakura (Prince) and Keiko (guard) wandering the
hills). &quot;...until one day a prince came to this country searching for his
destiny.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Mistress!&quot; (Gaia) &quot;God now I know what frozen vegetables feel
like!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s beautiful. Heartwarming just to look at her beauty...&quot; (Umi) &quot;Which
is good and all, because my blood was freezing up and I needed the
warm-up.&quot;

Servant (Keiko) - &quot;My liege, there&#39;s something you should see.&quot; (waits
for Sakura, nothing) &quot;There over that hill I noticed a strange sight. A
noble castle, covered in thorns, it might be the place you seek...&quot;
(nothing) &quot;...and it&#39;s guarded by the touch of evil...&quot; (silence) &quot;And some
strange blonde named Nina Sakura stole your look and is prancing around
in another series with a red knockoff CardCaptor Sakura outfit doing the
whole Harry Potter magical witch thing and... are you home? Hello!!&quot; (taps
on head) &quot;Earth to Prince! Am I talking to myself here!? Hello!!&quot;

(Sakura is mesmerized by the real scenery made by the holoprojectors).

Keiko - &quot;I know it&#39;s super realistic and all but snap out of it please...
it&#39;s embarrassing.&quot;

* * * * * *

Kero - &quot;Whoa! She looks good! But she needs to snap out of it though.&quot;

Tomoyo nodded her head, &quot;It took me two whole days to make that, but it
was a labor of love so I didn&#39;t mind in the slightest. I remember how
long it took to get the measurements because everytime I tried I couldn&#39;t
because she was so naked and every touch lead to something else and we
ended up having sex for every two measurements and it took the entire day
and---&quot; (blushes red) &quot;---uh, never mind.&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;Is this the strange castle I heard of?&quot;

Keiko spun on Sakura with a blank expression on her face. &quot;No it&#39;s the
local Blockbusters and we better hurry or we won&#39;t get a copy of Superman
Returns and OF COURSE IT IS!!&quot; (sighs) &quot;Nice to see your back to the
world of the living.&quot; (repeats her lines flawlessly and gets the proper
responses this time)

Narrator (Tomoyo) - &quot;The brave and noble prince of a faraway country had
heard the rumors of a castle covered in thorns.&quot;

Keiko (under her breath) - &quot;The gardener must have the millennium off.&quot;

&quot;We have been waiting for you.&quot;

Sakura - &quot;Who&#39;s there?!&quot; (spins in shock, blade drawn, Keiko also whirls
around and almost runs into Eve (fairy) falling backwards onto her rear
as she jumps back in shock). &quot;We are the fairies. We have been waiting
for you.&quot;

&quot;Sorry about that.&quot; Eve whispers as she pulls Keiko up, &quot;Figured you
wouldn&#39;t look very shocked unless I gave you a real fright to help your
performance along.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really. Broadway suits you, badly.&quot; Keiko sighs in a slight whisper
as she turns her attention back to Sakura, &quot;A beautiful princess sleeps
in this castle.&quot;

&quot;A princess?&quot; (Sakura is talking to Chihiru (Fairy #1)) &quot;In this castle
covered with thorns?&quot;

&quot;You do know, my liege, we could just move on---&quot; Keiko remarked,
shuffling her feet as she did, &quot;I do like being employed very much, sir,
and you being dead won&#39;t look good on the old resume in terms of future
employment and all.&quot;

Naoko (Fairy #3) - &quot;She sleeps, cursed by an evil witch.&quot;

Sakura (Prince) - &quot;That&#39;s terrible!&quot;

Keiko - &quot;We could find a village with a cute farmer&#39;s daughter and I&#39;ll
teach you the proper way to plow her sweet... ouch!&quot;

Eve (Fairy #2) - (whisper) &quot;Behave.&quot; (normal voice) &quot;If you truly wish to
save the princess...&quot; (looks at Keiko who shakes her head (&#39;I didn&#39;t say
anything.&#39;)) &quot;...then proceed.&quot;

The vines withdraw clearing a path to the castle.

* * * * * *

Back in the audience.

&quot;Nice effects,&quot; Umi whistles in admiration, &quot;but some of the casting
needed a little work. (Keiko can&#39;t seem to blend in even if her life
depended on it).&quot;

* * * * * *

Back to the play.

Fairy #2 (Eve) - &quot;The princess is in the tower room. But be careful, the
witch who cast the spell will not stand quietly by.&quot;

(Keiko looks over at Sakura with expectant eyes)

Sakura - &quot;I have this sword and my courage. I promise to break the
princess&#39;s curse.&quot;

(with a tired sigh, Keiko trudges up the stairs after her &quot;liege&quot;)
&quot;Unemployment, here I come, right back where I started from... Happy,
happy, joy, joy.&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;YAH!!&quot; (Kero) &quot;SHE ROCKS!! YEAH!! (Keiko&#39;s a total killjoy but Sakura
rocks!!)&quot;

Tomoyo nods her head, &quot;Sakura&#39;s just perfect at everything she does!&quot;

Suddenly the door slowly opens, as Kero takes cover. &quot;I&#39;m not
interrupting, am I?&quot;

&quot;---?---&quot;

&quot;Your singing earlier was quite beautiful. Your narration is excellent
too. (the costumes even look excellent). I commend your great work&quot;

&quot;Thank you---Captain Lazarus?&quot;

&quot;Jack. We first met during the Fly incident, remember? Well, sorta
met---&quot; (sighs) &quot;---anyway I&#39;m not here to bother you as I am to ask if I
can borrow Kerberos for awhile. I want to talk to him.&quot;

Tomoyo - &quot;There&#39;s no one here by---&quot;

&quot;Oops.&quot; (Jack smirks, smacking himself in the head) &quot;My bad. I have
gotten so used to it that I do it as a reflex.&quot; (stops for a second)
&quot;There, my suppression of my powers is down, and the levels are coming up
so even he can feel my power readings now--- as I feel his in turn.&quot;

&quot;Kero?&quot; (Tomoyo whispers in shock as he comes out into plain view, a
crossed expression on his face) &quot;Hmph. Can this wait? I&#39;m a little busy
at the moment.&quot;

&quot;I guess, after all I&#39;m in no hurry---&quot; (points forward) &quot;---oh, the good
part&#39;s on.&quot;

* * * * * *

Sakura confronts Yamazaki (good vs. evil)

Sakura - &quot;You&#39;re the witch who cursed the princess!&quot;

&quot;Get him, my lackeys!&quot;

Nina is first out of the starting gate, shocking all the &quot;lackeys&quot; by
springing ahead full charge, only to be met by Keiko&#39;s katana blade, the
two weapons sounding off as they collide head on (sparks flying).

As Sakura has at it (playwise) against the other students, Keiko &amp; Nina
all out go at each other with real gusto and vigor that their weapons
send off sparks with each strike as they pace each other and swing for a
kill shot. Almost.

&quot;Keep it tight!&quot; Keiko hisses slightly, &quot;I don&#39;t want my head removed by
accident!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m working on it, I&#39;m working on it--- should have gotten Hotaru to do
this role! She&#39;s better at this weapon than I am!&quot; (swings again to once
again be met by Keiko&#39;s blade) &quot;And isn&#39;t that completely heartwarming
for me to know that you might slip and gut me open completely by accident
due to your lack of skill with that---&quot; (Keiko stops for a second) &quot;How
indestructible is that blade again?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s find out.&quot;

With that Keiko jumps back to gain some space as Nina goes on the
offensive, only to come charging forward again swinging left and right
driving Nina back with each blow)

* * * * * *

Audience

Gaia - &quot;Look at Mistress Sakura and Miss Keiko go! Their blood must be
boiling with rage over the witch&#39;s evil deeds!&quot;

Umi - &quot;Please, Gaia, don&#39;t say &quot;boil&quot;--- I&#39;m cold!&quot;

Gaia - &quot;Think warm thoughts--- shouldn&#39;t we not be---&quot;

Umi - &quot;I&#39;m getting the feed from the TV broadcast for audio. Too much
chit-chat around us for a clear audio broadcast.&quot;

Gaia - &quot;Mostly from us, right? Maybe later we can warm up by taking our
clothes off and you can &#39;water&#39; my---&quot;

Umi - &quot;Be nice, we&#39;re in public.&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;Curse you--- prince---&quot;

Yamazaki stumbles back, all his henchbeings dead, clutching his chest as
he falls into the background (and onto a mattress)

Sakura, all smiles, raises her blade into the air, &quot;I did it! I defeated
the---&quot;

RRRUUUMMMBBBLLLEEE!!

The stage shakes as the &quot;ground&quot; shudders beneath them.

&quot;Wh-wh-what the-?!? Earthquake???&quot;

&quot;Holographic projector plus live audience plus TV audience plus greedy
Neko...&quot; (&quot;I&#39;M NOT GREEDY!!&quot;) &quot;...equals trouble.&quot;

The background shatters as fire rises from the ground, and something
beneath the &quot;stage&quot; screams.

&quot;What the!?&quot;

Keiko was besides herself.

&quot;I&#39;m guessing we&#39;re going to do the dragon battle scene from the movie...
right about...&quot;

A huge creature spewing flames and darkness leaps from the pit in front
of them.

&quot;...or we could be fighting a Balrog and Misho&#39;s gone over the deep end of
sanity...&quot;

&quot;THIS DIDN&#39;T HAPPEN LAST TIME!!&quot; (Sakura)

&quot;They didn&#39;t have Misho&#39;s budget (or her sick twisted idea of
&quot;entertainment&quot;) last time.&quot;

The two find themselves staring into the huge burning creature&#39;s blazing
eyes as it tenses, preparing to attack, Keiko begins to back up only to
stop. &quot;Maybe we should leave the stage.&quot; (Sakura)

&quot;Not with that novashield behind us.&quot;

&quot;What shield?!&quot;

Keiko quickly kicks back abit of holographic prop backwards, watching it
shatter as it hit a novashield between them and the audience, causing the
trademark rippling effect along the shield surface like a stone hitting a
calm lake. &quot;That shield.&quot; (Keiko motions for Sakura&#39;s sword) &quot;Switch
weapons! I&#39;ll take Nina&#39;s weapon, you take mine...&quot; (throws sword handle
first to her which Sakura snatches out of the air with one grab) &quot;...and
we&#39;ll go at it full bully.&quot;

&quot;What?!?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll... oh, just slash it already!&quot;

The dramatic music kicks in as they go at it with the &quot;witch&quot; in her
&quot;final&quot; form.

* * * * * *

&quot;Sakura...&quot; Tomoyo gasps, watching the action below. &quot;...she&#39;s so heroic!&quot;

&quot;Is she going to be OK?&quot; (Kero)

&quot;Oh, sure, it&#39;s only a hologram but what&#39;s with the...&quot; (the Balrog lets
loose a torrent of flame as the two dodge, the flames spewing harmlessly
against the forcefield) &quot;Oh.&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;DAMMIT!!&quot; Umi yelled.

&quot;Get it, Mistress! Get it!&quot;

&quot;FIRE!! FIRE!! (I&#39;m freezing! Heat needed over here!! More fire!)&quot;

&quot;----&quot; (Gaia)

* * * * * *

The creature rears back as it&#39;s weapons of flame disintegrate against the
weapons wielded by the heroes. Then, with a quick swipe, Sakura hurls
Keiko&#39;s sword through the &quot;Balrog&quot;&#39;s head, snapping it back dramatically,
sending the foul beast stumbling backwards and into the same &quot;pit&quot; that
Yamazaki fell into (only now it&#39;ll fall into a &quot;bottomless&quot; holographic
chasm).

&quot;I was aiming for it&#39;s arm.&quot; Sakura whispered.

&quot;That&#39;s OK, that&#39;s OK, really that&#39;s just fine.&quot; (Keiko remarks as she
watches it fall away) &quot;Anyway it&#39;s just as well. At least it didn&#39;t...&quot;
(Keiko stumbles as she falls towards the pit) &quot;AGH!! IT GOT ME!! IT GOT
ME!!&quot;

Sakura panics, leaping forward arm stretched out, &quot;KEIKO! HOLD ON! I---&quot;

&quot;Just kidding! Hold on.&quot; (jumps down into the pit and comes back up with
her blade) &quot;It got caught on a rock so it&#39;s fine. Had you going there a
second though, didn&#39;t--- ouch!&quot; (turns to Eve) &quot;Eve!&quot;

&quot;(behave).&quot; (motions to the top) &quot;The princess awaits.&quot;

Sakura nods, her stomach twisting in knots and her brow covered in sweat.
Slowly, and surely, she mounts the stairs and begins her long climb up.
Briefly she thinks back...

* * * * * *

Sakura&#39;s Flashback

Tomoyo, covered in the bedsheets, laughs again, motioning for Sakura.
&quot;Come on, I promise I won&#39;t bite! You got to get this right! Mr. Terada
wanted you to practice at home since... well...&quot; (After five fumbled attempts
at Sakura sheepishly trying to kiss Eliza, Mr. Terada finally gave up and
asked Tomoyo to help Sakura with her kissing scene.) &quot;...you&#39;ll do fine.&quot;
(Tomoyo was in a playful mood, but Sakura wasn&#39;t)

&quot;It&#39;s not like before, I felt better then.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t have a significant other like you do now. Come on, your fair
princess won&#39;t bite if you kiss nicely.&quot; (Tomoyo pulls the sheets up a
little to playfully show Sakura a little skin) &quot;Maybe your fair princess
might even warm up abit to your charms.&quot;

&quot;Tomo-chan.&quot; Sakura stammered, leaning forward only to be grabbed by
Tomoyo and rolled under the sheets, until Tomoyo came up on top, grinning
as she held Sakura down. &quot;Come on. I promise it&#39;ll be alright. Just think
of me in your heart and you can do it. Just hold this image, of us
kissing, and you&#39;ll be able to do it. No butterflies, no nervousness. As
long as you remember our love you&#39;ll be able to pull this off.&quot;

Sakura nods, nudging Tomoyo back down beneath her, and with a slight gasp
she (with much anticipation) delivers her kiss, holding Tomoyo in her
arms gently as she presses her lips to Tomoyo&#39;s to give the kiss of life.
Tomoyo sinks into Sakura&#39;s grasp and sighing pleasantly. &quot;That&#39;s my
prince.&quot;

* * * * * *

The image of Tomoyo, smiling, waiting for Sakura&#39;s kiss in her mind&#39;s
eye, she walked up the stage to where Eliza was &quot;sleeping&quot; and slowly
slipped onto the bed. &quot;Ahh! What a beautiful princess!&quot; (at this Eliza
shudders and turns red) As Sakura beholds the older woman, she shudders
briefly, wishing in her heart that it was her Tomoyo instead of Eliza.

Fairy #1 (Chiharu) - &quot;Only the kiss of true love can awaken the
princess.&quot;

Fairy #3 (Naoko) - &quot;If you truly love the princess, then please---&quot;

With that, Sakura shut her eyes, makes one final wish, then reaches out,
the stage lighting glaring into her vision even with her eyes shut,
making her &quot;world&quot; bright as she felt Eliza in her arms. There&#39;s a
tingle, and an electric shock as she draws close--- and touches her lips
to Eliza&#39;s, a tear running down Sakura&#39;s cheek. &#39;Forgive me.&#39; she thinks
to herself as she kissed another woman. For brief seconds she holds it,
but fells the energy to continue seep in as a warming embrace fills her.
Another tear rolls down Sakura&#39;s cheek as she fells ashamed of herself,
reacting to Eliza&#39;s kiss.As she pulled back she sobs silently, teeth
clenched. &quot;Tomo-chan...I...?&quot;

&quot;...Sakura-chan?&quot;

Quickly Sakura&#39;s eyes shoot open, the lights dazzling her for a second,
but her gaze (once recovered from the glare) comes down to stare firmly
at &quot;Tomo-chan?&quot;

&quot;I... wait a second... I was in the control room and now... but how?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; An infectious smile suddenly warms Sakura&#39;s features as
she smothers Tomoyo in another kiss, tears of joy rolling down her face.
Tomoyo, at first shocked, embraces Sakura and accepts the kiss and
returns it fully back to Sakura. The two fall onto the bed, wrapped in
each other&#39;s arms, kissing with great passion and vigor, the audience and
play all but forgotten.

* * * * * *

&quot;Knew having a &quot;understudy&quot; was the way to go.&quot; Eliza sighs, standing up
from Tomoyo&#39;s &quot;place&quot; in the control booth. &quot;Nice teleport. Liked the
fine detailed control you had over it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. Figured I had to have a good reason to be up here---&quot; Jack
winks, watching Eliza leave the room, turning his attention back to Kero.
&quot;Two things, actually.&quot;

&quot;So it was their plan all the time to...&quot;

&quot;Swap places with Tomoyo so Sakura could get to kiss her one and true
princess? Yes. Well--- that was Eliza &amp; Nina&#39;s plan. Keiko &amp; Rebecca were
kept out of the loop, ditto with Misho.&quot;

&quot;Think the network is having a hissy fit over this?&quot;

&quot;Do we care?&quot; Jack remarks offhandedly. &quot;Now---&quot; (drawing closer)
&quot;---about that talk---&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;I don&#39;t care what the censors do! Pull that plug and kiss a lot of
revenues GOODBYE!&quot; Misho yells, slamming her cellphone shut hard. &quot;Damn
them, they better keep this going...&quot; (up on stage, Sakura &amp; Tomoyo have
already started to sing the &quot;love song&quot; for the prince/princess at the
end, comfortably laid out on the bed the two sing as they gaze into each
other&#39;s eyes and hold each other close).

&quot;I love remarkably happy (yet kinda expected) happy endings, I even had
Tomoyo write the love song because I figured they might do something like
this, those hopeless romantics always sabotaging the best laid plans of
Nekos. It&#39;s good--- good for ratings that&#39;ll make me a mint from happy
people wanting to buy Sakura Prince &amp; Tomoyo Princess merchandise! I&#39;m---
so choked up--- my rating (and revenue) numbers for this event are going
to be the best Christmas present ever! I&#39;m so happy!&quot;

Keiko sighs, putting her katana back in it&#39;s sheathe, &quot;Gee, your all
heart aintcha.&quot;

* * * * * *

Meanwhile, back in the control room.

Jack sits down, leaning back in his chair as he stares at Kerberos.

&quot;I know you don&#39;t remember how it ended before... but maybe that should
change... just in case.&quot;

&quot;Just in case of what?!&quot; (Kero was a little miffed now) &quot;You have very
strong magic, I can see that, but this has something to do with HER
doesn&#39;t it? This pickle... pika...&quot;

&quot;Piccadello. Catherine Piccadello,&quot; Jack reminded him, &quot;and yes it has a
lot to do with her, which is to say not exclusively does this have
anything to do with her, but it has a good deal to do with her.&quot;

Kero - &quot;What does that mean?&quot;

Jack - &quot;There&#39;s more to Piccadello&#39;s role in the events that lead to now
than you think, Kerberos.&quot; (silence as Jack thinks for a second) &quot;She&#39;s
the one that help make this love possible--- between Sakura &amp; Tomoyo I
mean. And though their love is now unbreakable, she still has a role to
play, and therein lies a bit of a quandary and possibly even a threat
that even myself nor Ms. Mitsuki can yet forsee or even think of
countering at this point. Catherine Piccadello--- or what Piccadello
did--- may yet have dire consequences.&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;s still allowed to be near Sakura &amp; Tomoyo? That doesn&#39;t make
any sense!&quot; Kero challenges, to which Jack shakes a finger at him in an
accusing manner. &quot;Temper, temper. So judgmental are you? You should know
better about judging someone guilty before they can even prove their
innocence. Mind you, though, Piccadello didn&#39;t do it out of spite or any
truly evil intent. She did it out of a desire to do something for the two
out of good intentions.&quot; (Jack stops for a second, turning his gaze onto
Kerberos) &quot;Then again--- the road to hell is often paved with &quot;good
intentions&quot;.&quot;

Kero didn&#39;t know what that meant, wings fluttering as he regarded Jack
with a severe expression, &quot;What is she doing here? Now!?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Jack admits, watching the end of the musical as he talks,
&quot;I think it&#39;s because she was assigned here, but even then after her
experience the first time she could have easily bowed out and she
wouldn&#39;t have been thought the worst of for doing so. Something other
than mere duty is keeping her here--- but that is something only
Piccadello knows for sure. All I know is she&#39;s here, and her involvement
the last time sets up a bit of a sticky wicket to figure out.&quot;

Kero - &quot;Will there be a final judgment after the Clow cards are
gathered?&quot;

Jack - &quot;No. And if there is it won&#39;t be aimed at Sakura. She proved
herself to be mistress of the cards once, she won&#39;t have to do so twice.
But still, maybe there might be a judgment of sorts but what form that
judgment will take is something even I can&#39;t predict as this time.&quot;

&quot;Have you told Sakura any of this?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Jack shook his head, &quot;I&#39;ve been staying out of her way all this
time. It&#39;s best if she doesn&#39;t know more than she needs to at this time.
It&#39;s better for her that way.&quot; (smiles) &quot;Anyway you know as well as I do
that she&#39;ll figure it out eventually on her own, right Kerberos?&quot;

Silence, then--- &quot;I know. But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not still worried
about her.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t be much of a friend to her if you weren&#39;t worried---&quot;
(motions for Kero to draw closer) &quot;---and confidentially speaking? I&#39;m a
little worried to, but only because as a distant friend I feel obliged to
show concern for her safety even if I already convinced myself that
she&#39;ll be OK.&quot;

&quot;---then we&#39;re even---&quot;

&quot;I guess so.&quot; Jack leans back again, watching the final encore song
begin. &quot;Is there anything to eat after the show? I&#39;m starved.&quot;

&quot;Amen to that. I could go for food right about now (hungry!)&quot;

* * * * * *

The next day a cast party was going to be held to celebrate the success
of the event, but tonight since everything ran late they were just going
to head home. Umi &amp; Gaia cuddled and caressed each other in the back of
the huge car all the way home. Though---

Nina - &quot;Are you two cuddling or trying to start a fire?&quot;

Umi - &quot;C-c-cold! Must warm up!&quot;

Gaia - &quot;I can&#39;t feel my rear! More heat!&quot;

Nina - &quot;Anymore heat and we&#39;ll start to choke on the hot air---&quot;

As for Sakura &amp; Tomoyo? They cuddled together but more from the warmth of
their kissing and cuddling in the play that carried them to the car than
any feeling of actually being cold. The two didn&#39;t say a word, and it
seemed they didn&#39;t need to as their hugs and kisses did all the talking
for them.

Umi &amp; Gaia emulated the two mostly because it looked rather warm.

The ride back to the Daidouji mansion was rather quiet except for the
occasional complaint and Kero&#39;s stomach grumbling. They picked up take
out on the way home and everyone ate when they got back. Tomoyo &amp; Sakura
ate upstairs in Sakura&#39;s private kitchen and they retired early to bed.

* * * * * *

Sakura sighed, she couldn&#39;t sleep.

Over on the chairs, hung neatly, was her and Tomoyo&#39;s costumes from the
play.

&quot;Like a dream.&quot;

&quot;What is?&quot; (a sleepy Tomoyo rolls over, nudging Sakura slightly as she
asks the question)

&quot;---us--- it&#39;s like a dream. I mean, I never even realized how much such
a simple thing like a kiss could mean to me until--- I mean--- well---
you know what I mean--- but I want to say---&quot; (Tomoyo presses two fingers
to Sakura&#39;s lips, hushing her) &quot;You&#39;ll find the words when the time is
right. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;

&quot;I want to find the words now---&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s late, we better get to sleep for class tomorrow---&quot; Tomoyo kisses
Sakura on the forehead in an effort to chase away the brown haired girl&#39;s
pouty expression, &quot;You&#39;ll find the words when the time&#39;s right. Trust
me--- now is my precious going to sleep or do I have to get rough?&quot;

&quot;Ok--- Ok---&quot; (smiles) &quot;---good night---&quot;

&quot;Good night.&quot; (Kisses Sakura again, this time deeper and more
passionately, rolling her over into her waiting arm to hold Sakura tight
as they drifted back to sleep.

* * * * * *

The vision.

A figure in shadows, wearing a cape and sitting on the roof of the
Daidouji estates.

He was watching her.

Sakura looks up, noticing for the first time Lunaris in the sky above.
&quot;But it&#39;s night---&quot;

&quot;Lunaris sometimes appears in people&#39;s visions regardless of time.&quot;

Sakura looks around, but no one. The voice was coming from everywhere and
yet nowhere.

&quot;Sakura--- it&#39;s not time yet---&quot; (the voice calls to her) &quot;---we&#39;ll talk
again soon. Sakura--- Sakura--- Sak---&quot; (silence) &quot;Sakura?&quot;

&quot;Who are---&quot;

Sakura&#39;s eyes lazily drift open, coming face to face with a wide eyed and
curious Rebecca staring at her from in front of her desk. &quot;ACK!&quot;

&quot;I know the colonization period of the 21st Century is a tad dry and
boring but still---&quot; (Rena smiles as she rests her head on Sakura&#39;s desk,
looking at her sideways. &quot;Have a nice nap?&quot;

&quot;I-I&#39;M SORRY!!!&quot;

&quot;ACK!&quot; (Keiko jumps back with a start, waking out of her own stupor to
come crashing to the floor in an awkward way) &quot;---ouch---&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;m glad someone over there had worst falls than that in her
life--- still---&quot; (a smile creeps across Rena&#39;s face) &quot;---that was worth
it. Thanks, Sakura.&quot; (stops) &quot;You have practice today?&quot;

&quot;No---&quot;

&quot;Then cuddle and snooze at home please, thanks.&quot; (walks back to the
board) &quot;And that goes double for you, Miss blades!&quot;

&quot;---oh shove it---&quot; Keiko hisses as she pulls herself back into her
chair.

The day was nearly done, and they were going to the party for the cast
members of the play next.

Misho was holding it at a room in the huge Convention Center she built in
downtown Tokyo, and went through a lot of trouble to make it a hot ticket
event. Still--- Suddenly Sakura noticed Rebecca was next to her again,
&quot;I&#39;m awake!&quot;

Rebecca leans over and whispers to her, &quot;I noticed how beautiful you are
when your sleeping. So very very cute--- Nina doesn&#39;t know anything.
Snoozer indeed. Your so very---&quot; (Rebecca reaches a hand out, but stops)
&quot;---I&#39;m jealous.&quot; (with that Rebecca retreats without another word said,
leaving Sakura confused.)

* * * * * *

&quot;Rebecca said that to you?&quot; Tomoyo asked, her face filled with curiosity.
&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know---&quot; (class had dismissed and the two were walking to the
party) &quot;---but I have this strange feeling---&quot;

&quot;Uh oh.&quot; Tomoyo stops, looking a little concerned, &quot;When you feel like
that something is going to happen. Is there a card nearby?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know--- I can&#39;t explain it but---&quot;

&quot;Give it time then.&quot; (Tomoyo takes Sakura&#39;s hand as she steps past her)
&quot;It&#39;ll come to you.&quot;

Suddenly Sakura stops, her head looking upwards, &quot;Rebecca?!&quot;

Sitting perched in a tree, Rebecca watches as the two draws near,
dropping down in front of them as they draw close. She reaches into a
pocket and withdraws two things, a Seeker, and a wristband with a jewel
setting. &quot;Got something for you, Tomoyo. Merry Christmas.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Tomoyo accepts gracefully, her expression turning curious as
Rebecca pushes the Seeker sphere towards her. &quot;Your Seeker?&quot;

&quot;Yours. It took me awhile but I found another Seeker, it&#39;s yours. Figure
it&#39;ll come in handy.&quot;

&quot;---why thank you---&quot; Tomoyo whispers, bowing as she accepts the mystical
object. &quot;How do I take it home? In my bag?&quot;

&quot;Tap it to the crystal on the wristband. It&#39;s a storage device, it&#39;ll
hold anything you want in it.&quot;

&quot;How practical!&quot; Tomoyo gleefully remarks, tapping the sphere onto the
wristband where it&#39;s enveloped in a field of light and swallowed into the
jewel setting. &quot;How do I---&quot;

&quot;Tap the jewel and think of what you want, and it&#39;ll come out. Easy as
that. And oh, I didn&#39;t forget you Sakura.&quot; (draws a Clow Card out and
shows it to her) &quot;The Sh---&quot; (Rebecca quickly clamps Sakura&#39;s mouth shut)
&quot;Shhh!! It&#39;s sleeping--- don&#39;t say it&#39;s name or it&#39;s bang-bang-I think
I&#39;m dead, Ma&#39;am.&quot; (Sakura sheepishly nods as she puts the card away)
&quot;See? Even a doofus like me can catch a Clow Card when it&#39;s fast asleep.&quot;
(smirks at her own witty remark) &quot;Well, nuff of that. Let&#39;s go, I heard
the party is going to feature a hundred kinds of frosted sugary hells to
tempt and lord knows I don&#39;t want to miss THAT. Let&#39;s---&quot; (Sakura&#39;s hand
grasps Rebecca&#39;s arm) &quot;---?--- what is it?&quot;

&quot;Rebecca--- about earlier. What did you mean?&quot;

&quot;About what?&quot; Rebecca asked with genuine interest. &quot;What are you---?&quot;

&quot;When you said you thought I was beautiful, and was jealous.&quot;

&quot;But I didn&#39;t say---&quot; (stops, face flushes slightly) &quot;---I was down with
Misho preparing for the party so I asked Catherine to sit in my class for
me because I knew I wouldn&#39;t make it back in time and---&quot; (a slight irked
expression passes over Rebecca&#39;s face) &quot;Did she take my

form? That---&quot; (?) &quot;---what was she---&quot;

&quot;Phwee?&quot;

&quot;Uh--- nothing. Never mind. Forget about it.&quot; (Rebecca backs away, waving
at the two) &quot;Better hurry before the party starts without us! Come on!
Cakes won&#39;t wait forever!&quot;

&quot;But Rebe---&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s gone.&quot; Tomoyo notices, watching her speed off. &quot;What was that all
about?&quot;

&quot;---I don&#39;t know---&quot;

As the two walk away hand-in-hand, on top of one of the school buildings
Catherine watches, her hands clenched together as if she was wringing
them, watching as Sakura &amp; Tomoyo walked away.

&quot;---goddess I am jealous--- aw man---&quot; Catherine sighs, wrapping her arms
around herself trying to keep the chill out. However, unknown to her,
someone else watches her from behind just out of her sensory range---

* * * * * *

Meanwhile--- The Shining Star International Spaceport

(The Dream Continent of Hong Kong)

&quot;I&#39;d have to say I&#39;m a little surprised your going so soon after your
promotion.&quot; Xai Shar (the 5th Judgment of the Shining Star) remarked, her
long hair cascading down her back as she shook her head back and forth,
her Palominian features (animorphic horse/human female

features) sweating slightly as she regarded her companion. &quot;You&#39;re the
youngest girl I&#39;ve seen rise to the rank of 11th Judgment. It takes some
ages to rise the ranks but you&#39;ve done it remarkably fast for one so
young.&quot;

Silence, her companion seemed too intent on her ticket to notice. She
only noded her head at Xai Shar&#39;s remarks. &quot;And what of your mentor? The
one you told me about? Will she be there?&quot;

&quot;Yes. She&#39;s always been there--- in Nippon.&quot;

&quot;And this boy--- I mean man you told me about? Isn&#39;t he leaving also
for---&quot;

&quot;He is.&quot; She quickly responded, cutting the conversation on him short.
Xai nods her head, pushing the topic of &quot;him&quot; aside. &quot;Will you be gone
long?&quot;

&quot;Not long. Not until I help Sempai recapture those annoying cards and
returned home again.&quot;

&quot;Well, whatever possessed you to do this I wish you the best--- so long,
Meilin.&quot;

Meilin smiles, her Judgment uniform feeling very comfortable as she gives
her companion a hug goodbye. &quot;Think Sempai will be surprised I&#39;m
visiting?&quot;

&quot;Before or after you tell her the good news?&quot;

&quot;She might be a little disagreeable---&quot; (smirks) &quot;---but this time I&#39;m
not taking no for an answer! Before next year is out I&#39;m going to be a
married woman and she---&quot; (smiles) &quot;---you know the rest.&quot;

Ten minutes later her flight leaves, destination - Tokyo.
