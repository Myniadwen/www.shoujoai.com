<a href="../ccs/luv4ever-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>THE DAY BEFORE THE WEDDING:

&quot;No! That goes over there! You! Make sure that there are flowers on 
every table, and you, be sure that we have plenty of ice on hand ok?&quot;

&quot;Hai!&quot;

&quot;Touya? Can you please make sure that the Vallets know that they can&#39;t 
park the cars on the street after 9:00? If we have to, we can use the 
garage.&quot;

&quot;No problem.&quot;

&quot;Yukito? Can you go and see if Sakura needs anything? Tell her that I&#39;ll 
come and see her once I finish up here, and that I&#39;ll bring her 
something to eat.&quot;

&quot;Of course. You know Tomoyo...you really are an amazing person. Not many 
people could do what you&#39;re doing.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Everything.&quot; Said Yukito, smiling warmly.

Tomoyo walked over and pulled him into a warm hug and thanked him for 
all of his and Touya&#39;s hard work.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome. I&#39;ll go tell Sakura to expect you soon.&quot;

Yukito headed upstairs to Sakura and Tomoyo&#39;s room to give her the 
message. He gently rapped on the door.

&quot;Sakura-chan? Can I come in?&quot;

&quot;Just a sec!...ok!&quot;

Yukito opened the door to see Sakura standing infront of a full length 
mirror in the exquisite wedding dress that Tomoyo had made for her. She 
was turning from side to side to get a better look at how the beautiful 
white garment fit her now rather large figure. Yukito&#39;s face showed a 
slight blush at how mezmerizing she looked.

&quot;You look so beautiful Sakura-chan! I&#39;ll bet this is exactly how your 
mother looked on her wedding day.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;s everything going out there Yuki? Is Tomoyo doing alright? She 
must be exhausted.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s ok. She wants to finish up out there, then she&#39;s going to come be 
with you and bring you something to eat.&quot;

&quot;Great. I&#39;m starving! I think I might be eating even more than you right 
now!&quot;

&quot;Ha ha. Well don&#39;t forget, you&#39;re eating for two now.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Did you need anything Sakura? You want something to drink?&quot;

&quot;No. Thank You. I&#39;ll just wait for Tomoyo.&quot;

&quot;Ok. I&#39;m going to help your brother with the Vallets. I&#39;ll be back later 
ok?&quot;

&quot;Thanks Yuki.&quot;

A few hours later, Tomoyo headed upstairs after personally finishing up 
most of the important details for tomorrows ceremony. She opened the 
door to their room and saw Sakura sitting in her favorite chair reading 
a book.

&quot;Hello Sakura-chan. How are you feeling?&quot;

&quot;Nervous. Even more so than when I married Sayoran.&quot;

Tomoyo sat beside her on the bed and took Sakura&#39;s hand in her own. She 
leaned in and placed a light kiss on her cherry pink lips.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m nervous as well. You ARE my first bride after all.&quot;

&quot;Still.&quot;

Tomoyo groaned and rubbed her shoulders to try and relieve some of the 
days stress. She didn&#39;t want to be all sore and stiff on the most 
important day of her life. Sakura moved behind her and took over.

&quot;Geez Tomoyo-chan, you really shouldn&#39;t work yourself like this. You&#39;ve 
got so many knots back here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine, just a little stiff is all.&quot;

&quot;Hey. How about we have a bath? It&#39;ll help you relax, we&#39;re going to be 
busy all day tomorrow so we won&#39;t see much of each other until the 
ceremony, and then the reception.&quot;

&quot;Sure! I&#39;ll get our clothes while you fill the tub ok?&quot;

Sakura walked into the bathroom to get things ready while Tomoyo grabbed 
them some clean clothes and set the bed so they could climb right in 
afterwards. Tomoyo helped her lovely wife undress and they slowly sank 
into the tub. Sakura inched closer to Tomoyo and rested her head on her 
shoulder, letting the heat of the bath melt away her nervousness and 
anxiety of the wedding. She closed her eyes and sighed contently as 
Tomoyo ran her fingers through her short, auburn hair. Tomoyo jumped 
when she heard Sakura gasp.

&quot;What? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Here. Feel.&quot; Said Sakura as she placed Tomoyo&#39;s hand on her swollen 
stomach.

&quot;She&#39;s kicking again.&quot;

Tomoyo blushed and placed her hand on her cheek as she felt another kick 
from their unborn child.

&quot;She certainly has alot of energy! She must be excited about tomorrow as 
well.&quot;

Tomoyo leaned down and placed a kiss on Sakura&#39;s belly, getting a giggle 
from her in response. This time it was Tomoyo&#39;s turn to rest her head on 
Sakura, and she soon found herself being lulled to sleep from the 
rythmic sound of her wife&#39;s and their daughters heartbeat.

&quot;Come on Tomoyo. Let&#39;s go to bed. We have to get up early, and there&#39;s 
still alot to do tomorrow before the ceremony.&quot;

Tomoyo helped Sakura out of the tub, and after they got dressed, Tomoyo 
sat on the edge of the bed while Sakura braided her hair like when they 
were kids. It was these simple gestures that made Tomoyo&#39;s love for her 
wife all the more special. Sakura finished and they laid down to try and 
get some sleep.

&quot;Good night Tomoyo-chan.&quot;

&quot;Good night Sakura-chan. Sleep well.&quot;</pre>
