<h1>Trick or Treat (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ccs/tricktreat-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>She woke up the next morning to the smell of her father cooking 
breakfast like he usually did. But this time, it had smelled even more 
delicious than usual. Her stomach growled as she stretched and got out 
of bed. She sat at her desk and brushed her hair as Kero woke up and 
begged her for some food. 

&quot;I&#39;ll bring some up to you after ok?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;d better! The wrath of a hungry guardian beast isn&#39;t something you 
want to deal with.&quot; 

She put on her uniform and ran downstairs to get her share of the food 
before her greedy brother ate it all. Her face lit up as she noticed 
Tomoyo standing in the kitchen next to her father, helping him cook 
breakfast. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan!&quot; She squealed as she hugged her friend from behind. She 
turned her around and gave her a sweet, good morning kiss on the lips. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get used to this.&quot; Said Touya. 

Tomoyo and Sakura had been going out for some time now, and everyone was 
happy for them. But Touya still had a hard time grasping the concept 
that his baby sister was in love with another girl and teased them about 
it often. 

&quot;Mother had to go into work early this morning, so she said that she 
would drop me off here on her way. When I got here, your father was just 
starting to cook breakfast and I asked him if I could help.&quot; 

&quot;I accepted, and Tomoyo had a great idea about adding some spices to the 
meat so... I asked her if she could show me.&quot; 

&quot;At least it&#39;ll taste better than when Kaiju cooks.&quot; 

Sakura quickly closed the distance between herself and her brother and 
gave him a smack upside the head for his trouble. 

&quot;Stupid Onii-chan!&quot; She said while sticking out her tongue. 

Fujitaka asked Tomoyo to sit and started dishing out the wonderfully 
smelling meal. After breakfast, Sakura took some up to Kero, got her 
Schoolbag, and headed back downstairs to see Tomoyo waiting by the front 
door. 

&quot;Sorry about that. Thanks for waiting Tomoyo-chan.&quot; 

She slipped on her shoes and took Tomoyo&#39;s hand as they headed of to 
School. 

&quot;So? Have you decided on what you want your costume to be Tomoyo-chan?&quot; 

&quot;Of course!&quot; 

&quot;Well.... what is it?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s a surprise. You&#39;ll see it tomorrow when I give you yours.&quot; 

Back at the house, it was Touya&#39;s day off, so him and Kero continued 
their conversation that Sakura had cut short last night. 

&quot;Ha Ha. This is going to be great!&quot; Said Kero. 

&quot;I&#39;ve already got the materials so, all I need to do now is make it.&quot; 
Said Touya. 

&quot;Will it take long?&quot; Asked Kero. 

&quot;No. Not really. The hardest part is going to be getting Sakura to find 
it.&quot; 

&quot;Why not put it in the shower? Then, when she changes into Tomoyo&#39;s 
costume, I&#39;ll make a noise so she&#39;ll look inside. When she does, I&#39;ll 
make it jump out at her.&quot; 

&quot;Ha Ha! Great!&quot; 

&quot;Hey, just out of curiosity, why didn&#39;t you get Yue to help you instead 
of me?&quot; 

&quot;Because he would never do something like this to Sakura.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s true.&quot; Said Kero. 

&quot;When it&#39;s done I&#39;ll let you know so we can do a test run ok?&quot; 

&quot;Ok.&quot; 

At school, Tomoyo and Sakura had made it into the classroom just in 
time. They walked to their desks and Sakura let out a blood curtling 
scream. 

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEK!!&quot; 

She turned around and ran to the front of the room, jumping up on Tereda 
Sensei&#39;s desk. 

&quot;What!? What is it!?&quot; Asked Chiharu. 

Her and Tomoyo ran to Sakura&#39;s desk to see what all the fuss was about 
as some of the boys starting laughing. When they got there, they saw a 
little fake spider sitting near the edge of her desk. Chiharu put her 
hand to her mouth to try and cover her laugh as Tomoyo looked back at a 
still frightened Sakura. 

&quot;Is it gone!? Did you kill it!?&quot; 

Tomoyo chuckled a bit as she picked up the little beast and brought it 
to show Sakura. 

&quot;No! Keep it away!&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not real Sakura-chan.&quot; Said Tomoyo while laughing. 

&quot;Hoe?&quot; 

She quickly poked it and saw that it didn&#39;t move an inch. The boys were 
still laughing, and even some of the girls joined in. The rest of the 
boys congratulated Yamazaki on his little prank as Chiharu and Sakura 
looked at each other and nodded. Sakura jumped off the desk and drop 
kicked him in the head as Chiharu started choking him. Everyone in the 
room burst out laughing as Tereda Sensei entered the class. 

&quot;All right everyone, settle down and take your seats please.&quot; 

The rest of the day went on as usual, although Yamazaki had a splitting 
headache. 

Sakura had invited Tomoyo to her place after school, and that with it 
being Friday, maybe have a sleep over. Tomoyo accepted but said that she 
wanted to put some finishing touches on their costumes before she came 
over. Sakura agreed and the two shared a hug and a kiss before going 
their seperate ways. Tomoyo rushed home and got right to work on 
finishing their costumes for tomorrow night. She decided to have dinner 
with her mother, as she would be gone most of the day tommorrow. But 
Sonomi promised her daughter to return before her and Sakura arrived to 
go Trick or Treating. After dinner, Tomoyo wrapped up the costumes, 
packed an overnight bag, and headed for Sakura&#39;s. At dinner, Sakura told 
her dad and brother that she wanted Tomoyo to spend the night and that 
she was bringing their costumes with her. After hearing this, Touya 
wolfed down his dinner and ran upstairs to tell Kero that their chance 
would come   later that night. He picked up his &#39;Project&#39; and put it in 
the shower. Kero&#39;s part would come later, when Tomoyo would ask Sakura 
to try on her costume.
