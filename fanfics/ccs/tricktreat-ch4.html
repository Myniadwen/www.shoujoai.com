<h1>Trick or Treat (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a>

<a href="../ccs/tricktreat-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Grrr! I&#39;m going to kill them!&quot; 

Tomoyo walked in the room and closed the door behind her. 

&quot;It&#39;s ok Sakura-chan. You can kill them later. Right now you&#39;d better 
put some clothes on before you catch cold!&quot; 

Tomoyo took the blanket from around her and folded it neatly while 
Sakura looked around for her clothes. Tomoyo looked back at Sakura and 
blushed. 

&quot;What?&quot; Asked Sakura. 

&quot;Nothing. It&#39;s ok.&quot; 

&quot;What is it Tomoyo-chan?&quot; 

&quot;Well... It&#39;s just... You look so cute right now!&quot; 

Sakura sweatdropped. 

&quot;Th... Thanks. I think?&quot; 

Tomoyo helped Sakura with the rest of her costume and picked up her 
Camcorder. 

&quot;You look so Kawaii!&quot; She squealed while placing one hand on her cheek. 

Sakura blushed as she looked at herself in the mirror and noticed that 
something was missing. 

&quot;Tomoyo-chan? Aren&#39;t I supposed to have a broom or something?&quot; 

&quot;Oh! You&#39;re right! Oh no!&quot;  

&quot;Hey! I know! I can use my staff!&quot; Exclaimed Sakura. 

&quot;I guess. But it won&#39;t be the same.&quot; Tomoyo said with dissapointment in 
her voice. 

&quot;It&#39;s ok Tomoyo-chan. This way I can get my revenge on Onii-chan at the 
same time.&quot; 

&quot;Huh? What do you mean? How?&quot; 

&quot;You let me worry about that. I would like it if you could film it for 
me though.&quot; 

Sakura leaned over and whispered into Tomoyo&#39;s ear. Tomoyo&#39;s smile grew 
slowly and her eyebrows raised as Sakura told her about her idea. The 
two girls shook hands in agreement and went to work. Tomoyo went down 
the hall and stood outside Touya&#39;s room with her video camera rolling as 
Sakura pulled out one of her Sakura cards. She flung open his door and 
stared at him angrily while he told her how silly she looked in that 
outfit. Tomoyo got an angry look and turned toward Sakura. 

&quot;Do it Sakura-chan!&quot; 

Sakura twirled her staff and yelled: &quot;Little Card! Turn Onii-chan into 
the size of a three year old!&quot;  

She brought her staff down on the card and Touya was enveloped in a 
flash of light. He was frozen stiff as the cards power took effect, 
slowly shrinking him down to the size he was when he was three years 
old. The light faded, and Touya realized what had happened as he look up 
at Sakura, who seemed to tower over him like a telephone pole. He 
sweatdropped as Sakura glared down at him and cracked her knuckles. He 
screamed as he tried to run away. 

&quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!&quot; 

&quot;Get back here Onii-chan!&quot; Yelled Sakura as she chased after him. Tomoyo 
followed them with her Camcorder and laughed as Sakura kicked him in the 
butt over and over. He tried to leave the room, but Tomoyo stepped in 
front of him and blocked his path. He turned around and saw Sakura raise 
her staff high above her. She brought it down square on top of his head. 
He collapsed and moaned as he saw dozens of little witch Sakura&#39;s 
dancing around his head. 

&quot;That&#39;ll teach you!&quot; Said Sakura. 

&quot;Hmmph!&quot; Tomoyo said while turning curtly on her heel and walking after 
Sakura. 

Sakura sighed as she stopped at the top of the stairs. A broad smile 
appeared on her face and she started laughing at what had just happened. 
Tomoyo joined in and they laughed until they had tears in their eyes. 

&quot;Ok, ok. We should get going before it gets too late.&quot; Said Sakura. 

They headed downstairs to tell her dad that they were ready, and that 
they were going to Tomoyo&#39;s before going Trick or Treating. 

&quot;Did you girls want me to give you a ride?&quot; 

&quot;No. That&#39;s ok dad. We already have one.&quot; 

Tomoyo looked at her in confusion as Sakura put on her shoes. 

&quot;Sakura-chan? We don&#39;t have a ride.&quot; She stated matter of factly. 

Sakura took Tomoyo&#39;s hand and led her outside. She took her around the 
back of the house and looked around.  

&quot;Sakura-chan?&quot; 

Sakura leaned in and kissed Tomoyo passionately as she pulled out the 
Fly Card. They broke the kiss and Sakura showed Tomoyo the card. 

&quot;You ready?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;Yes! Of course!&quot; She replied enthusiastically. 

&quot;FLY!&quot; 

A pair of wings appeared on Sakura&#39;s back and she stood behind Tomoyo 
and hugged her tightly. Tomoyo nodded to Sakura that she was ready and 
they took flight. Tomoyo sighed in awe as she saw the twinkling lights 
of the city below. A few bright bursts of color from fireworks lighting 
up the night sky ahead of them.  

&quot;It&#39;s so beautiful!&quot; She said as she focused her Camera in on them. 

&#39;Not as beautiful as you.&#39; Thought Sakura as she blushed and looked down 
at Tomoyo. They landed a few minutes later at Tomoyo&#39;s and made sure 
everything was perfect before knocking.  

&quot;That was amazing Sakura-chan! Thank You!&quot;  

&quot;You&#39;re very welcome my little Princess!&quot; 

Tomoyo giggled and pulled Sakura closer. She was about to kiss her when 
the door flew open and they saw Sonomi standing there with stars in her 
eyes and a video camera in her hand. 

&quot;Ohhhh! You two are so cute together!&quot;  

Sakura and Tomoyo sweatdropped. 

&quot;Trick or Treat!&quot; They said together. 

They returned a few hours later and went upstairs to Tomoyo&#39;s room to 
get a better look at their loot. 

&quot;Don&#39;t eat too much tonight girls or you&#39;ll be sick!&quot; Yelled Sonomi from 
downstairs. 

&quot;Hai!&quot; 

&quot;So? What do you want to do for the rest of the night?&quot; Asked Tomoyo. 

Sakura got a bright smile on her face and stood up. 

&quot;I know!&quot; She said as she helped Tomoyo to her feet. 

She went into Tomoyo&#39;s bathroom and closed the door. Tomoyo was going to 
go in and see what she was doing when Sakura asked her to knock on the 
door and say Trick or Treat. Tomoyo did and gasped when Sakura opened 
the door. She was standing there completely naked and blushing. 

&quot;Treat.&quot; She said as she kissed Tomoyo and led her over to the bed.  

Sonomi had her ear to the door and smiled as she heard Sakura&#39;s words. 

She giggled and thought to herself: &quot;Treat indeed.&quot; </pre>
