<a href="../ccs/darkdawn-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;Hey, Sonomi, it&#39;s nice to see you,&quot; the red headed woman said as she 
watched them approach, leaning up against the wall nearest to the 
front door.

Kaho smiled at her, &quot;Good evening, Ranma.&quot; She looked a bit concerned 
as she asked her, &quot;Are you still on bouncer duty?&quot;

Ranma smiled and gave a little shrug. &quot;Until we&#39;re sure that Vegeta 
isn&#39;t going to be coming back here, we&#39;re rotating the duty,&quot; she 
explained.

Ranma&#39;s eyes seemed to light up when she noticed Sakura and Tomoyo 
standing there just behind Sonomi. Kaho hid a smile, while Sonomi just 
grinned at her.

&quot;Down, girl,&quot; Sonomi chuckled softly, adding, &quot;they&#39;re both taken, 
anyway.&quot; Ranma sighed out her disappointment, and Kaho chuckled 
softly. &quot;Sakura, Tomoyo,&quot; Sonomi said, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Saotome 
Ranma.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; Sakura said with a smile and little bow, 
while Tomoyo murmured her greetings as well.

&quot;Just head on inside,&quot; Ranma commented, as the winter wind whistled 
all around them, &quot;we can talk later.&quot; She pulled open the door and 
waved them all inside.

The four went down the short hallway, and then emerged into a much 
larger room inside. &#39;Probably was a converted factory,&#39; Tomoyo 
thought, looking around the massive open space. There was a fancy bar 
on one side, a group of dining tables, a good sized dance floor, and 
even a cozy library with comfy couches and endtables!

&quot;Good evening,&quot; a pretty brown hared girl in her school uniform said 
to them with a cheery smile. From a large pile right beside her she 
passed over a brightly wrapped gift to each of the surprised members 
of the party.

&quot;Hi, Hitomi,&quot; Sonomi smiled. She shook her gift cautiously, &quot;I see 
Juri&#39;s doing Christmas in style this year. Who went out to buy the 
presents?&quot;

&quot;We split the duty up between everybody,&quot; Hitomi explained. A little 
blush appeared on her cheeks, &quot;I suspect at least some of the gifts 
are a bit... naughty.&quot; A smile, &quot;Would you like a table, or are you 
visiting the bar first?&quot;

&quot;I think our friends need some relaxation medicine, first,&#39; Kaho said, 
smiling at Tomoyo and Sakura. &quot;We&#39;ll see you later, all right?&quot; Hitomi 
gave them a wave as they made their way through the crowd to the bar.

&quot;This place is incredible,&quot; Sakura said, looking around her in awe. It 
was packed, women filling all the tables, lined up along the long bar, 
and covering the dance floor. She carefully shielded Tomoyo from the 
crush, receiving a grateful smile.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Tomoyo said with a smile. A bit more quietly she added, &quot;I 
came here alone once before, but it was quite a while back.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Sonomi said, more than a bit surprised. &#39;Hope Sakura 
isn&#39;t too bothered by that,&#39; she fretted silently.

&quot;It was long before Sakura moved in with me,&quot; Tomoyo said softly, a 
little bit worried herself at Sakura&#39;s silence.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Sakura said, gently taking Tomoyo&#39;s hand in her own. 
&quot;I should know that a beautiful girl like you would have her share of 
suitors,&quot; and she smiled at her widely, &quot;I&#39;m just glad that I&#39;ve got 
you now.&quot;

&quot;That was so sweet,&quot; a red headed girl said, just beside them. All 
four of them startled slightly at her sudden appearance.

&quot;Asuka,&quot; her blue hared companion gently chided her, &quot;I think that was 
meant to be a private romantic moment.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, Rei,&quot; Asuka said, blushing a bit. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said 
with a little bow as Rei pulled her aside.

Sonomi and Kaho were fighting a case of giggles. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Sonomi said, 
finally breaking up laughing as Tomoyo glared at both of them.

They finally reached the bar, and in only a few seconds a woman 
appeared before them. She literally appeared from seeming nowhere, 
smiling at them all in a friendly sort of way. Her long blue hair 
reached all the way down her back, her cat-like eyes were striking, 
and the twin scars on her face looked almost charming.

&quot;What can I get you folks?&quot; Minagi asked them all.

&quot;We&#39;ll start with some rum and eggnog, I think,&quot; Sonomi said, looking 
over at the others. She received a chorus of agreeing nods, and Minagi 
disappeared, reappearing in front of a freezer to pour them their 
drinks.

&quot;Good evening,&quot; a friendly voice said. Sakura turned around to see a 
striking looking woman standing there. She was tall and lean, athletic 
looking, and long, orange gold hair cascaded down her back. &quot;I hope 
you&#39;re having a good time?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Sakura said shyly, wondering who this woman was.

&quot;Turn off the charm, Juri,&quot; Sonomi said with a smile, &quot;she&#39;s taken.&quot; 
She offered her hand, which Juri took wishing her, &quot;Merry Christmas.&quot;

&quot;All the good ones are,&quot; Juri said sadly. Tomoyo reflexedly took 
Sakura&#39;s hand, and a little smile teased at Juri&#39;s lips as she said, 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m harmless.&quot;

There was a soft snort of laughter from Minagi as she delivered the 
four drinks. Juri gave her a wounded look, and Kaho fought to hold 
back a laugh.

&quot;I think I&#39;m not going to get very much respect here tonight,&quot; Juri 
chuckled softly. &quot;I&#39;ll see you all later on tonight, maybe,&quot; she said 
with a wave over her shoulder as she went off to mingle with all the 
other guests.

Sakura smiled, shaking her head admiringly. &quot;Can I be her when I grow 
up?&quot; she asked no one in particular.

Tomoyo laughed softly, &quot;I&#39;m happy with you just the way you are.&quot;

&quot;Do you think they&#39;re going to be like this all night?&quot; Kaho asked 
Sonomi in a stage whisper, smiling at her jokingly.

Sonomi pretended to think about it. &quot;Very probably,&quot; she said with a 
smile. She looked towards the tables, &quot;Hey, there&#39;s an opening.&quot;

They forged towards the table, when Sakura saw something odd about a 
couple that was dancing in the corner. Excusing herself for a moment, 
she crept up behind the two of them and gently tapped one of them on 
the shoulder.

The Dark turned, looking over at Sakura in honest surprise. The Light 
peered over the Dark&#39;s shoulder, looking kind of startled as well. 
&quot;Mistress Sakura,&quot; the Dark said, and then she asked, &quot;what are you 
doing here?&quot;

&quot;I was about to ask you the same question,&quot; Sakura said dryly, 
continuing, &quot;How did you get out of the Book of Clow, anyway?&quot;

&quot;You are our Mistress,&quot; Light explained, &quot;but that does not prevent us 
from leaving for short periods of time.&quot;

&quot;Let us finish our dance,&quot; Dark said, gently stroking at the Light&#39;s 
cheek, &quot;and we will happily return to our place in the Book.&quot;

Sakura smiled at them both, &quot;Promise me you won&#39;t cause any trouble, 
and you can keep dancing all night, OK?&quot;

&quot;No trouble,&quot; the Light said with a nod, still swaying gently to the 
music in the Dark&#39;s arms. The Dark nodded as well, and Sakura decided 
that it would have to do.

Sakura turned to go to the table, when she saw Tomoyo standing there 
with her video camera. &quot;Just like old times,&quot; Tomoyo said with a grin.

Sakura sweatdropped, took Tomoyo&#39;s hand, and headed to the table.

A odd looking, blonde hared girl was taking Sonomi and Kaho&#39;s orders. 
&quot;So, four dinner specials, and you&#39;d like to book an upstairs room 
later tonight? No problem!&quot; she said, sounding very hyperactive, but 
kind of cute.

&quot;Thanks, Excel,&quot; Kaho said. She noticed Sakura and Tomoyo standing by 
the table, Sakura looking confused while Tomoyo was giving them a 
knowing smirk.

Sonomi blushed faintly. &quot;We ordered dinner for you two,&quot; she said 
quickly.

&quot;Why does a club like this rent out rooms for the night?&quot; Sakura asked 
them curiously. The other three blushed, while searching for the words 
to explain. A faint blush began to appear on Sakura&#39;s face, as she 
finally got the idea. &quot;Never mind,&quot; she muttered, blushing brighter.

&quot;Sit down for dinner,&quot; Kaho invited, blushing a bit herself.

The young woman appeared, rising from the floor like someone coming 
back from the dead! &quot;Your dinners,&quot; Hyatt said, dropping off the 
plates with a smile. She went green, and fell right over.

A wide eyed Sakura watched her slither away through the bustling 
crowd. &quot;Is she all right?&quot; she asked them worriedly.

&quot;She&#39;s like that all the time,&quot; Sonomi said calmly, digging into her 
dinner.

The food was wonderful, and Sakura enjoyed it. But even more she 
enjoyed sitting beside Tomoyo, sharing smiles and quiet conversation 
as they ate their food. Finally, she pushed the plate away, sighing to 
herself happily.

Tomoyo raised her glass, her eyes twinkling as she looked at Sakura. 
&quot;To life,&quot; she toasted softly, wondering if she would remember the 
cue.

Sakura smiled, tapping her glass gently against Tomoyo&#39;s &quot;To love.&quot; 
They smiled at each other, lost in each other&#39;s eyes.

They both drank, then Sakura smiled softly, rising to give Tomoyo her 
hand. &quot;Would you like to dance?&quot; she invited her.

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Tomoyo answered with a smile.

Kaho and Sonomi watched the two leave hand in hand. &quot;Isn&#39;t love 
grand?&quot; Kaho said with a little sigh. Sonomi surprised her, getting 
out of her seat to kneel by her side.

&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Sonomi said, taking Kaho&#39;s hand. She took a deep breath, 
and smiled at her wryly, &quot;I was planning to do this after the party.&quot; 
She puled a little box out of her pocket, &quot;I love you, Kaho, and I 
want you to stay a part of my life.&quot; The box opened, and a diamond 
ring gleams inside, &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;

The bar is nearly silent as everyone hangs on Kaho&#39;s answer. Tears 
streak her face as she wraps her arms around Sonomi, &quot;Yes!&quot;

&quot;Way to go, mom,&quot; Tomoyo whispered, a few tears in her eyes. She felt 
gentle fingers turn her head, and Sakura smiled at her, her eyes 
serious.

&quot;I don&#39;t have a ring to give you,&quot; Sakura said softly, &quot;and I don&#39;t 
think I could say it as well as she did.&quot; They swayed together slowly, 
and Tomoyo found herself holding her breath as she waited for what she 
hoped was coming next. &quot;But I love you, Tomoyo, and I would be honored 
if you&#39;d consider marrying me.&quot;

&quot;I love you, too,&quot; Tomoyo said softly, the tears free flowing now, 
&quot;and the answer is yes.&quot; She leaned forward to kiss a slightly 
surprised Sakura, before pointing above their heads, &quot;Mistletoe,&quot; she 
explained. </pre>
