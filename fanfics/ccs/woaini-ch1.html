<h1>Wo Ai Ni</h1>

<pre>She was hurting. Meiling could see that and she wanted to comfort her.
She reached out to touch her shoulder but was brushed away. &quot;Gomen
nasai,&quot; she said softly.

She sniffed. &quot;I guess I know how you felt now, Meiling-chan...&quot;

Meiling bit her lip. How could Shaoran leave Sakura? How? They had
seemed to perfect for each other, but even while she was thinking this,
she was secretly glad. And it angered her that she was happy about it.
Now she could have a chance at her one true love... but Sakura was in
pain...

Kinomoto Sakura wiped the tears from her eyes. She turned to Shaoran&#39;s
cousin and smiled weakly. &quot;Arigotou for trying to cheer me up, Meiling.
You must have hated me... when...&quot;

&lt;&#39;I don&#39;t hate you.&#39;&gt; Meiling wanted to say it, but the words caught in
her throat so she merely nodded.

Sakura sighed and looked up. &quot;I trusted him...&quot; Her voice broke. &quot;He
can&#39;t seem to make up his mind...&quot;

That was the problem with Shaoran, they both knew. He never seemed to
know what he really wanted. First Yukito, then Sakura, now someone
else.

&quot;It&#39;ll be all right, though,&quot; Meiling said soothingly, reaching out to
rub Sakura&#39;s back.

Sakura brushed her hand away. &quot;Iie, it won&#39;t. It won&#39;t ever be okay
again.&quot;

Meiling shifted uneasily. &quot;Demo there are a lot of people out there.
There must be &lt;someone&gt; out there that can love you better than Shaoran.&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but I can&#39;t love anyone else more,&quot; Sakura said softly.

Meiling flinched. &quot;Kinomoto-san...&quot;

&quot;Gomen, Meiling-chan...&quot; Sakura stood. &quot;I have to go.&quot; She began to run
away.

&quot;Matte!&quot; Meiling called desperately, but the girl was already too far
away to hear. She bit her lip and hung her head. &lt;&#39;Shaoran... how could
you? She won&#39;t love anyone else... no one.&#39;&gt; Silent tears slid down her
cheeks. &lt;&#39;Kinomoto-san... iie, Sakura... I... wo ai ni...&#39;&gt;
