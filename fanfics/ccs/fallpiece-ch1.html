<h1>Falling to Pieces</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lectricity.html">The Ghost of 'lectricity</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I adore the works of CLAMP. I even have the Miyuki-chan DVD 
and the first two volumes of the manga. Errr... I know it 
doesn&#39;t sound impressive, but if you knew where I live you&#39;d 
understand... ^__^;;

So anyway, I only watched some 10 episodes of the Sakura anime 
and the first movie but I&#39;ve read the complete manga. (The 
last scene really is kinda depressing for Tomoyo/Sakura fans 
isn&#39;t it. In fact, the whole last volume...) And so I went 
looking for some fanfics and I haven&#39;t found much. Much good 
ones that is. There is a lot sugary friendship-love stories 
with a plot that ... sucks. Anyway, here&#39;s my take. It&#39;s not a 
darkfic, despite the title! Please  tell me how you like it.

------------------------------------------------------------

 Tomoyo blinked in surprise. Even now, after more than 15 
years of friendship Sakura still managed to surprise her. As 
much as Sakura always said Tomoyo was &quot;a bit weird&quot; - the 
feeling was mutual.

 &quot;H- hi, Tomoyo. I need a place to stay for a few days...&quot; 
Sakura said as she put her bags down in front of Tomoyo&#39;s 
apartment. Tomoyo just did what she knew best when hearing one 
of Sakura&#39;s crazy ideas. She smiled.

 &quot;Sakura-chan, come in. Of course you can stay here.&quot;

 Twenty-four years of age, Tomoyo still couldn&#39;t deny Sakura 
any of her wishes. The young filmmaker who was just making her 
debut was glad her friendship with the greatest magician there 
had ever been was still as fresh as ten years ago. Even though 
she never was able to tell her just how much Sakura means to 
her. Her mother told her that it was starting to show. Maybe 
that&#39;s why her mentor said the short movie that she had 
graduated from Tokyo Film Academie with was &#39;dark&#39;; and when 
that woman said something was &#39;dark&#39;, it meant that it was 
&#39;terribly dark&#39;.

 Always it was Tomoyo to whom Sakura first went when something 
happened. Tomoyo was the first to know that Sakura was in love 
with Lee-kun, every detail of what happened on their dates, 
that she was moving in with him. And she always came to her 
best friend when she needed someone to listen to her, when she 
needed advice or comfort. Tomoyo knew about their fights. 
About how he hit her. He didn&#39;t mean to do it, it just 
happened. And not just once. He was someone who kept to 
himself, he didn&#39;t open up to no one. He kept everything 
inside until it just exploded. And Tomoyo was the first - and 
only one - to know about the pregnancy and the abortion.

 Now Sakura was at her door again. Her smile was as bright as 
when they were children and her eyes were shining.

 &quot;I left him,&quot; was all she said. Tomoyo couldn&#39;t believe it. 
It was ten years ago that Syaoran came to Tokyo and no less 
than seven years that he returned to claim his love. Tomoyo 
didn&#39;t think Sakura would be able to do it even though she did 
everything she could to make Sakura realize that this wasn&#39;t 
how it was supposed to be.

   ***

 With a simple twist of fate, everything was like it had been 
when they were children. Before they both knew that the world 
wasn&#39;t always the wonderful little piece of heaven it was 
supposed to be. They were going to the park together, to the 
aquarium, eating in fast food parlors and fancy restaurants. 
But the more wonderful it was the more painful it was becoming 
again. The sweet pain of having her so near but still just out 
of reach. They even slept in the same bed! It was a double bed 
but that&#39;s beside the point. She just couldn&#39;t say no when 
Sakura had asked.

 Sleepily she swayed slowly to the bathroom. Looking in the 
mirror she took a short brown hair out of her dark ocean of 
locks. Holding it between her fingers she was looking at it. 
Her look was completely empty, her mind rendered blank by the 
silken brown strand that bound her existence to the magician. 
She put it slowly and carefully down into the sink as if it 
was something of great value that needed special attention. 
After this was done she put her hair in a big bun at the back 
of her head and took off her night robe. 

 Slowly the warm water warmed her and woke her up on that cold 
winter morning. Today she didn&#39;t have any appointments, she 
didn&#39;t have to go talk to the producers, she didn&#39;t have to go 
over the script with the actors. There was a lot of fuss 
around a simple TV production and nobody wanted to take any 
chances with the young director who was allowed to contribute 
to the show and &#39;present&#39; her talent. It was a free day, 
surely to be spent with Sakura. Maybe just a quiet day at 
home.

 She was deep in thought and didn&#39;t hear the bathroom door 
open and close. She didn&#39;t think anything of it as she heard 
the movement inside the bathroom and she didn&#39;t react as she 
sensed another body entering the cabin. She automatically 
stepped a bit forward to give the other one enough room. Then 
a pair of hands undid her hair and let it fall down.

 &quot;I always thought your hair was beautiful hanging down your 
naked back.&quot; To this and to the hands that came to rest above 
her hips she did react. Her brain was kick-started and she 
tried to turn around but the stronger pair of hands held her 
firmly at the shoulders now and refused to budge. 

 &quot;It&#39;s very sexy, you know,&quot; a seductive voice close to her 
ear whispered. The hands released their grip, probably to 
stroke her hair that started to plaster to her back, and she 
used the chance to face the intruder.

 &quot;Sakura, what are you doing,&quot; Tomoyo said in a stern tone. 
Well, she tried to at least. She was afraid her voice was 
giving in to her desire as she was glancing at Sakura&#39;s naked 
body in front of her. After all, it was a rare chance.

 &quot;Tomoyo-chan, you were just so beautiful and I-&quot; here a 
elusive smile formed on Sakura&#39;s face, &quot;wanted to join you in 
the shower...&quot; Sakura started saying, but Tomoyo wasn&#39;t buying 
it and Sakura knew that. Curling her lips into a smile she 
tried again.

 &quot;To-mo-yo,&quot; she spoke slowly, slurring the syllables in a 
sexy voice. &quot;Isn&#39;t this what you always wanted?&quot; Tomoyo 
suddenly paled a few shades. She froze for a moment but 
quickly enough recovered to ask, stammering:

 &quot;H- how can you know that?&quot;

 &quot;I don&#39;t think that matters now, does it?&quot; Sakura said again 
in a tone that made Tomoyo shiver for various reasons. Then 
slowly the brunette leaned in closer. She stopped just before 
reaching the other and all Tomoyo was able to do was to close 
her eyes and wait to see if her eyes and ears were playing 
tricks on her.

 No, apparently not, since she felt a pair of soft but 
determined lips press against hers. And that was not the only 
thing that pressed against her. Her mind was racing, racing to 
find a solution, a solution that won&#39;t hurt. That won&#39;t hurt 
the one she loved most.

 &quot;Sakura,&quot; she began, as the kiss was broken. She tried to 
block it completely, physically giving in but not letting 
herself be aware that she was being kissed by the most 
beautiful, most perfect person in existence.

 &quot;Sakura, you&#39;ll regret this. Please, just go back to bed and 
forget about this.&quot; &#39;You&#39;re not like me!&#39; she wanted to 
scream.

 &quot;Damnit, Tomoyo, just be selfish for once in your life!&quot; 
Sakura&#39;s green eyes flashed with anger as she shouted at the 
stunned black-haired beauty. &quot;Don&#39;t you see, I need you as 
much as you need me! Just let go of everything that was always 
holding you back!&quot;

 Tomoyo froze up as she stood in the shower like a lifelike 
statue. A tear escaped her eyelids but Sakura didn&#39;t see it, 
she couldn&#39;t have since Tomoyo&#39;s face was wet already. She 
didn&#39;t want Sakura see her cry, she didn&#39;t want to be 
comforted by her, she never wanted Sakura&#39;s pity... But that 
didn&#39;t matter now did it? Sakura knew it all. As expected she 
couldn&#39;t hide it from her.

 &quot;I will be a broken woman when you leave,&quot; Tomoyo tried a 
last appeal to their friendship. All she always tried to do 
was not to hurt Sakura - not caring how much she herself 
suffered. Now she was begging Sakura to respect her feelings, 
to not use her and leave her by the side of the road.

 &quot;Don&#39;t you trust me?&quot; Sakura asked simply, once again 
rendering Tomoyo speechless. It was such an unfair question. 
Both knew the answer. Just like that Tomoyo&#39;s defenses were 
disarmed, swept away and obliterated. Just like that Sakura 
walked in and claimed Tomoyo&#39;s heart, nothing dared to stand 
in her way. More tears flowed down Tomoyo&#39;s cheeks, tears of 
resignation and defeat.

 Again she the pair of hands on her naked body and she let 
herself be taken onto the sharp razorblade edge that span 
across her feelings for Sakura.

 &quot;Everything will surely be alright, won&#39;t it, Sakura?&quot; Tomoyo 
said, placing her hopes in Sakura&#39;s tag line.

 &quot;No,&quot; Sakura answered in a determined voice. &quot;If it&#39;s about 
you I&#39;ll make sure everything is all right.&quot;
