&lt;From the diary of Daidouji Tomoyo, aptly named &quot;Sakura Musings&quot;&gt;

April 13, 1994
	Dear Diary.

	It has been awhile that I wrote in here and I&#39;m sorry for 
leaving you at such a crucial point where my dear Sakura seemed to be 
just inches away from confessing her love to Syaoran. The reason why I 
didn&#39;t get to write in here lately is that something really incredible 
happened. Something so incredible that it will also effect this diary.
	For as long as I kept this, I have dedicated these entries 
solely to my one true love. The walking miracle that is Sakura-chan, 
trying to capture my thoughts on the beautiful girl that had captured 
my heart from the first day we met. But now, I can&#39;t write about 
Sakura alone anymore because the most joyous, unexpected thing 
happened...
	But let me begin from the beginning, yes? It was on the day 
Li-kun was going to return home. I had already suspected of course 
that Sakura as was typical of her would only realize her feelings at 
the last moment. Not that I want to say that she is... indecisive. 
Sakura just has a hard time realizing her own feelings but you really 
cannot fault her for that. It is just as I told her a short while ago. 
Peoples hearts are hard to predict - even Eriol-kun said so. And 
usually it is hardest to understand your own heart.
	But back to what happened. Since Sakura was expected to come to 
her realization a little late, I went and called her early. That was 
when the first odd thing happened. I was actually going to tell her 
about where she could find Li-kun but instead I only reached her 
brother and Touya told me that she was already out...
	Going back to practice, I had pretty much shrugged it off and 
told myself that it didn&#39;t matter. If she managed on her own, all the 
better, even though I would have liked to help. All I ever wanted to 
be was a part of Sakura&#39;s life. Before Li-kun came along I used to 
entertain the hope that maybe in the future, when her crush on Yukito 
passed and we were both older, I might actually seize my chance and 
tell her. But it became apparent that Sakura and Syaoran were meant 
for each other and developed feelings that both were reluctant to 
realize and admit to. But that day, when I thought for sure that it 
would be Syaoran she would ultimately choose as her special person, I 
had to realize that with all that I deemed to know about Sakura, a 
person can neither predict someone&#39;s else hearts accordingly. I 
learned that sometimes if you think you know someone else&#39;s heart, you 
might end up surprised.
	Back to events. It was near the end of our next practice session 
that I noticed someone watching me. You know that prickling feeling at 
the base of your neck? It got stronger and stronger and it filled me 
with almost giddy anticipation although I couldn&#39;t fathom why. I had 
ignored it for awhile, concentrating on the practice. However, it 
became too much and I finally glanced towards the entrance and there 
was Sakura.
	I was so totally baffled I almost missed the next several notes. 
I would have bet all my insurance - and that is after all plenty - 
that she would have been with Li-kun at that moment. It was about the 
time when his bus left for the airport after all... I don&#39;t think 
Sakura ever managed to confuse like this before. I thought I knew my 
best friend and secret love so well but her appearance had totally 
thrown my belief for a loop.
	But that was not the only surprise I should get. Approaching her 
in the pause, I immediately realized that something was different 
about her. Outwardly she seemed to be the same person but inside there 
was something so completely different that it startled me for a 
moment. I briefly entertained the notion that it might be Mirror or 
Illusion but was pretty sure that I would notice that. It was still 
Sakura, just... different... somehow.
	Then Sakura told me she saw Syaoran off - as expected - and 
confessed that she does love him. I couldn&#39;t help but feel a little 
disappointed for a brief moment. When I saw her standing there, I 
hadn&#39;t been able to help the thought, the hope that maybe... But that 
was crazy, illogical, Sakura and Syaoran were meant for each other and 
Sakura would be happy with him... Or so I immediately told myself 
again.
	That was when Sakura really shocked me. While she loves Syaoran, 
there is a person that she loves equally but who needs her more. 
Syaoran isn&#39;t necessary to give her life meaning and neither is she 
for Syaoran&#39;s life. That is how she put it. Then she told me she 
couldn&#39;t live without me, though, and asked me if I could live without 
her.
	Of course the question was silly, needed no answer and I believe 
Sakura had not expected one. But when her words finally sank in... I 
can&#39;t describe how I feel because I&#39;m not sure if there are words 
existing in any written or spoken language that properly can describe 
my feelings in that moment and the ones that followed. I barely 
managed to find my voice in order to respond, asking what exactly she 
meant by that. Of course, the question was rhetorical. That spark of 
hope at seeing Sakura standing there, watching me sing, had exploded 
from a tiny star into a full-fledged super nova. The meaning of her 
words had been all too clear, yet the emotions suddenly welling up 
from deep inside me were overwhelming and hindered my thought process 
a lot.
	Sakura told me she wants me - ME - to be her special person and 
gave me a teddy bear.
	God, I was sure my heart would stop beating right there, frozen 
in this moment of perfect bliss.
	But it didn&#39;t, thankfully, because I would surely have regretted 
if it did. Hearing these three words from Sakura, spoken honestly and 
with clear conviction behind them was a gift I would cherish forever. 
Oh, how I had longed for this moment. It hadn&#39;t mattered right then 
that Sakura might be a little different and it still doesn&#39;t matter. 
Nothing really mattered then and right now. Okaasan says I am 
&quot;deliriously happy&quot; nowadays. But who can forbid me that? Sakura loves 
me as much as I love her. Her beautiful, kind heart has chosen me to 
claim that special place only reserved for one person. How can I not 
be &quot;deliriously happy&quot; then?
	It had been only later in the day that I found out exactly what 
had made Sakura change her mind and what is so different about her. 
The experience was quite shocking itself. Apparently Sakura had been 
traveling back in time by capturing a hidden Clow Card. She hasn&#39;t 
told me any details about the future she left yet and I won&#39;t pry. It 
is painfully obvious that whatever dire reason she had for this 
action, whatever had happened in the future, saddened her. It is in 
her eyes. When she thinks I&#39;m not watching her - what I do most of the 
time anyway. There is something...haunted there. It pains me to know 
that my dearest Sakura had to go through such hardships in her time 
and would give everything to know how to take that pain away. But I 
will let her decide when she wants to tell me everything. For now what 
she told me that day at choir practice turns out to be the truth. She 
is beginning to be happy, more her old self again. I can tell it will 
be a long path though and by now everyone close to Sakura has noticed 
some changes but only a few seem concerned. Sakura told me that she 
could be happy now that she is with me. And she is happy. Genuinely 
happy. And I am the one that makes her happy!
	So, what does that mean for this diary? Well, it is not going to 
be solely dedicated to my beloved anymore. Now that she has proposed 
to share her life with me, I will make this diary a dedication to OUR 
relationship. OUR. I still can hardly believe all this and if you ask 
me now about my exact thoughts, I think I am still not ready to form 
any remotely coherent ones.
	It is becoming late, I will write in here some more at a later 
point.

******************************

May 6, 1994

	Yes, I&#39;ve said I write earlier but a lot of things happened. 
Well, not that much but more like what happened has kept us very busy. 
While I never was opposed to the idea of coming out I am surprised at 
how fast it is happening. Interestingly neither Sakura&#39;s family nor my 
mother were really surprised at finding out Sakura had chosen me 
instead of Li-kun. I suspected at much but it still manages to make me 
happy. The least I wished was to cause Sakura any more trouble. It is 
apparently hard enough for her to deal with her time travel... aside 
from complaining about having to go back to school and learn all that 
boring stuff again! (she&#39;s so cute when she pouts!). No, the 
transition seems not to be an easy one, especially on an emotional 
level. Sakura is almost clingy ever since confessing to me. Not that I 
mind, definitely not. But it worries me. It&#39;s almost like she expects 
me to disappear any moment. By now, even without her telling me, I 
become firmed in my belief that whatever happened in her time must 
have included my and probably the others&#39; deaths as well. My heart 
aches at how much pain I sometimes seem in her eyes and since we are 
sleeping over a lot I have woken more than once finding Sakura shaking 
with a nightmare. I wish I could take them all away but that&#39;s one 
thing I can&#39;t do. All there is left for me is to be there for the one 
girl I love and help her forget about the trauma that has driven her 
here and into my waiting arms.
	Mind you, that sounds like she&#39;s a frightened wreck but that 
isn&#39;t the impression I want to give you. Those moments are rare and 
mostly private. Sakura is most comfortably opening up to me and that 
display of trust makes me love her even more... if that is even 
possible. Yet, the change is becoming obvious to anyone close to 
Sakura. As much as she tries to &quot;act her age&quot;, this Sakura IS far more 
mature and the weight of her heavy past (or future, whatever way you 
want to look at it) doesn&#39;t allow her to completely fall back into her 
innocent self.
	Do I love her less because of that? If you know me, you 
shouldn&#39;t even be asking that question. Even if she&#39;s older mentally 
and far from the innocent cheerleader that managed to capture my heart 
within a second of meeting her, she is still Sakura. There is 
something unique about her. Actually, there are many things unique 
about her. Like her big heart that seems to be big enough to include 
anyone who wants to have a part of it... and even those who don&#39;t. Or 
her fierce determination when she gets an idea in her head. Right now 
I am experiencing a whole new dimension of that determination all 
focused on me. It often leaves me overwhelmed thinking alone that 
Sakura&#39;s genki spirit will now always be focused on me and my needs. 
She&#39;s constantly getting me things, asking me what I want to do when 
all I really need is her. But Sakura is persistent about making me as 
happy as possible. And I am as happy as possible. Really, I am.
	It appears I have come a little off topic. I was talking about 
her families reaction. Quite frankly if there had been any surprise, 
it would have been on my part if they actually had been surprised. 
Touya-san is always so observant and looks out for his sister. He 
never liked Syaoran much for some reason. I always thought it might be 
that on some level he wanted to keep Sakura close to him. Sometimes I 
wish I had such a protective brother. However, he seemed rather 
pleased after admitting to our relationship.
	Sakura&#39;s father, Fujitaka, didn&#39;t seem overly surprised either. 
He just smiled and said he is happy for us and that we will surely 
take good care of each other. I suppose since he experienced the 
affection between his wife and my mother, it must have been rather 
hard even for me to hide my feelings - not that I tried very hard. 
Both he and Sakura&#39;s brother seemed just a little surprised at the 
suddenness though. Especially since it had been apparent lately that 
Sakura would choose Li-kun... Neither of them asked about this though 
or about Sakura&#39;s weird mood (she is a lot quieter these days).
	Anyway, that leaves my mother. Well, Sakura is almost scared of 
her now, I think. About the way she&#39;s going on about how happy she is 
that we are in love and that we make such an adorable couple. Of 
course, her older mind must have figured out what happened between her 
and Nadeshiko by now but I must admit even I find my mother a little 
intimidating at times when she speaks about her late love (especially 
in association with Sakura&#39;s father)... and Okaasan is practically as 
fond of Sakura as she is/was of her own mother.
	Our families aren&#39;t the only ones that know though. Sakura&#39;s 
public confession at choir was clear enough. Even if not everyone 
heard what was said, within the days talk around school had managed to 
make it pretty much clear to anyone. Rika, Chiharu and Naoko seemed a 
little surprised but otherwise were more or less alright with it. I 
think they are more baffled that Sakura&#39;s scores have become as high 
as mine and Rika&#39;s...
	Apart from that everything is fine. We cannot complain, despite 
all those little things. I am sure, given time, Sakura will get over 
her experiences and settle into her new life. It still warms my heart 
to think that she felt obligated enough to choose me for that purpose 
and not Syaoran. I don&#39;t doubt her one minute when she says she really 
loves me. It&#39;s obvious in every action lately, there is no way someone 
can play that. Besides, Sakura has always been a very honest person, I 
am sure she wouldn&#39;t lie to me - or anyone - about such an important 
matter. No, Sakura and I are happy and I intend to keep it that way, 
forever if Sakura wants me to.

******************************

May 20, 1994

	We had our first real date today and it was a glorious event! We 
hadn&#39;t had found time to actually do something like this until now. 
Okay, if you read this you might say that we are just eleven... Normal 
kids don&#39;t have &#39;dates&#39; at this age. True, I suppose. The thing is I 
am 
quite aware of some of the other kids at school saying how mature I 
often act and I won&#39;t argue with them there if they&#39;d ever directly 
ask me. That has nothing to do with arrogance. It is more a 
good-natured confidence in my abilities. I have always had an 
excellent learning ability. Okaasan says that sometimes she thinks I 
have some sort of eidetic memory. I wouldn&#39;t go so far since then I 
doubt I would have to study at all for some subjects. No, I have 
always liked learning new things and ever since meeting Sakura I 
wanted to learn even more to help this magnificent creature through 
life. I realized quickly back then that for all her enigmatic 
abilities she was often a tad bit... na&iuml;ve (I really don&#39;t like that 
word) and would need guidance in some areas and in others would need 
to be sheltered. Like a beautiful but fragile flower that will die 
quickly if not constantly kept in the right environment.
	To shorten all that. I guess I have always been a little 
precocious.
	As for Sakura. Well, she isn&#39;t the innocent girl anymore anyone 
knew. The other children have more or less gotten used to it but they 
seem a little... &quot;weird out&quot; to quote Sakura herself. That was to be 
expected too, though. No, given that in her mind Sakura was already 
seven years older than me, I believe you can grant her the right to go 
out on dates, right? I think she&#39;s having a harder time with some 
things about being little again than she lets on. I mean, I can hardly 
begin to comprehend what it has to feel like, suddenly being younger 
again, with a full recollection of being almost an adult. Must be 
really weird. I am helping her as much as I can and am amazed again 
and again every day at Sakura&#39;s ability to let her self be loved but 
also at giving back this love. I have never felt so... important 
before in my life. Why it is true that I am probably one of the 
smartest girls in my age class - Sakura not withstanding (but she has 
seven years in advance of me, technically) -, I can hardly say that I 
had much friends or other such social contact outside of occasional 
choir practice before coming to Tomoeda and meeting Sakura.
	Meeting Sakura has been a blessing and that is why I will be 
eternally grateful and why I would never dream of rejecting her just 
because she&#39;s... different now. My love is hers forever and always. 
After all Rika-san is seeing someone older too (I have a suspicion 
Sakura knows from the looks she gives her sometimes but she won&#39;t 
tell), so why should it be different for me? Sakura is still Sakura. 
Seven years of life experience and maturity have not really destroyed 
what I love about her. Certainly not. There is a lot of sadness and 
pain but it is dulling, I can tell, and that is bound to have some 
effects on her personality. Like she&#39;s quieter, calmer, more serious. 
However, I have witnessed enough moments already that show that Sakura 
is still able to let go and simply enjoy the moment.
	No, I won&#39;t... I can&#39;t love her any less. This is all a part of 
Sakura now. Besides, the new level of maturity doesn&#39;t only have 
negative effects. At times I actually find myself liking the older 
Sakura a little more since we are now able to communicate on a higher 
level. Not that she&#39;s suddenly become a genius but she certainly does 
know a lot more about life in general as the Sakura before the fateful 
day at choir practice. I will forever cherish her innocent self, yet I 
know it is not completely lost. In time I am sure she will be a lot 
like the old Sakura again. I&#39;ll take her any way she wants to be, that 
is for sure.
	But I&#39;ve been getting away from the point. I actually wanted to 
talk about the date! You see how much she is affecting me already, 
normally I would not digress from the point that much. Not that I am 
complaining, mind you.
	Anyway, it was very beautiful. We had found ourselves a nice, 
sheltered spot at our all time favorite King Penguin park. It had been 
a warm, sunny day, perfect for a picnic for two (Sakura had to 
literally threaten Kero not sneak in and disturb us). I think I must 
have giggled like a little child with joy when Sakura proceeded to use 
Flower and create a bed of Sakura blossoms for us. It was so 
beautiful, so absolutely perfect!
	We sat there for hours, talking or simply enjoying each others 
company. Sakura seemed to have made it her special duty to make this 
the perfect day for me. I am a little disappointed for not getting 
much to do in return but seeing how happy Sakura was just relaxing, 
being with me, it makes my heart flutter even now. For the first time 
since her time travel I think I finally saw her completely at peace. 
This is a very precious memory to me.
	And then, as evening drew closer, Sakura somehow managed to find 
the perfect ending. I still can&#39;t believe she did that! It was all so 
amazing. I hadn&#39;t suspected anything when Sakura told me I had to hold 
tight onto her so that she could show me a special gift. Needing no 
reason to not comply with such a thrilling request, I was caught a 
little off guard than Sakura called for Fly. I had never thought she 
could carry me! (at least not that long) It was a little bit of a 
strain for her, I could tell, but she managed. And if the sheer 
excitement of being carried through the late evening sky hadn&#39;t been 
enough, just guess where she set us down!
	At the top of Tokyo Tower!
	We sat there for almost an hour, watching the sunset. It was a 
moment straight out of a picture... or maybe more like a famous 
painting. Oh yes, it was a little cold up there but I hardly minded. 
Not to mention that Sakura seemed to have the presence of mind to keep 
up a little fire magic all the time (she really has gotten A LOT 
better).
	Once again I am not sure I can describe what exactly went 
through me when, close to the end, Sakura whispered to me an 
&quot;Aishiteru&quot; in a voice thick with emotion and followed that up with a 
short but sensual kiss. There is too much that is still waging inside 
of me like a hurricane and it is all too jumbled to put into words, 
nor would words do any of it justice. However, I can tell you for sure 
that if Sakura hadn&#39;t held me tightly the whole time, I am sure I 
would have fallen off the support beam we had settled on.
	I am still so... thrilled! I have been trying to get to sleep 
for almost an hour now to no avail, so I decided to sit down and write 
all this down now rather than tomorrow. However, I am still much too 
excited. I wonder if I get any sleep tonight at all! Sakura is really 
an unique experience and it gets even more special than you are the 
single-most focus of her attention!
	Dear Diary, I really AM the happiest girl in the world!

******************************

April 5, 1997

	It&#39;s been a long time since I wrote in here. Almost three years.
	Oops.
	I guess life has simply been too good for me to write down 
anything. I have my tapes after all and all those wonderful memories 
of three wonderful years with Sakura so far which are far more worth 
than any recorded pictures could ever be. I can hardly believe it&#39;s 
been that long. We are both in our second year of Junior High now. I 
could tell you so many things now but I think I&#39;d be sitting here all 
night. Well, it&#39;s Friday but still...
	Oh, who am I kidding? There is a reason after all I actually 
remembered having that diary, I thought writing in here again would 
actually help me calm my mind and get things into the right 
perspective. You see, Sakura and I have reached a phase of our 
relationship that probably has to come for any couple one time or 
another. We had our first big fight just five days ago. God, I feel so 
horrible. It was so dumb and unnecessary and... I just... don&#39;t know 
what&#39;s gotten into me.
	Maybe I should start from the beginning. I&#39;m not sure where the 
tension really began to build up but I believe it might have been 
since we entered Junior High. There were just slight nuisances, 
beginnings of something that seemed to bother Sakura greatly. Tomoeda 
Junior High is a little different than the Elementary School... or it 
is VERY different may be a better way to describe it. The teachers are 
very strict as is the headmaster, the school prides itself with its 
good image and tradition. That posed to be a problem for us. Back in 
Elementary School everyone more or less took us for granted. We were 
THE couple, really. Everyone found it cute and romantic that we were 
together... well, mostly everyone. Now, now we have to be extremely 
careful around whom we can trust to show feelings for the other that 
are more than friendship. Within the first weeks at Tomoeda Junior 
High we learned the hard way that Japanese society might tolerate a 
cute crush between two young girls but if they turn out to be two 
maturing young teenagers who openly show their love for each other, 
then the alarm bells are ringing in some people&#39;s heads. It is a good 
thing our families stand behind us and support our relationship 
despite some of the harsh treatment we had to endure at the beginning. 
I swear Okaasan was ready to sue the school, Touya-oniisan right 
behind her.
	Things settled down eventually and the initial uproar has blown 
over. Most people know about us but choose to ignore it. There are 
some rare people who actually try to support us - if not officially 
than at least in small actions (for example: giving leeway in the way 
of discipline or maybe giving a higher grade when one of us was 
in-between). So, not all people there are traditional man in business 
suits who&#39;d rather improve their self-image than care for their 
students, but a lot of them are. And not only once had we played with 
the tempting thought of transfer. There were enough - more modern and 
open-minded - schools in the area and both of us were smart enough; 
money wasn&#39;t an issue either.
	I think it&#39;s a bit of defiance probably. Not too mention all of 
our friends are there, even Rika who really could have gotten into a 
better school. But I can understand her well enough after finally 
figuring out that she is seeing Terada-sensei (who had - not so 
surprisingly - also transferred to Junior High, leaving me wondering 
if Rika followed him or he followed her!). That was a bit of a shock 
at first but at the moment I guess we are sitting in the same boat, 
sort of, and neither of us is keen on budging. Society can be cruel 
sometimes, especially the traditional-bound Japanese one. While 
Western influences had lessened that, there still were a lot of old 
families with a lot of influence.
	But enough about that. It has little do with the current dilemma 
since most of the drama had been in the beginning. I just mentioned it 
because some of it might have affected Sakura more than I initially 
thought. Why I still can&#39;t fathom but... Well, I hoped it would make 
more sense writing it down, however, it seems I am back to where I 
started from.
	The confrontation had been coming a long way, I guess, and yet I 
felt so terrible about it. I had noticed that Sakura is spending more 
and more time by herself, only with Kerberos (and I think Yue too but 
I can&#39;t be sure). I tried to talk to her about it but she&#39;s always 
saying the same thing. &quot;I&#39;m fine, Tomo-chan, don&#39;t worry about me.&quot; 
Somehow this feels a little like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. I used to say things like 
that often when we were just innocent children. It irked me a little 
but nevertheless I respected Sakura&#39;s privacy. She is after all a lot 
older than me (in her mind at least) and sometimes she just gets 
frustrated with being young again. You would think it&#39;d be a blessing 
for anyone, yet living it is probably a lot different, I guess. She 
won&#39;t tell me much about it... or everything concerning the time 
travel that brought her ultimately into my arms. Which brings us back 
to the root of the problem.
	At first I could ignore all of this, believing it must be too 
painful to remember or to talk about and Sakura doesn&#39;t want to worry 
me. Then, about half a year ago, a little after my fourteenth 
birthday, she started to spend all those hours alone in her room at 
her house (where she barely ever is anymore, at least not alone). I am 
pretty sure it has something to do with the cards and in this regard 
probably with Time. I remember that Kero lectured Sakura again and 
again about consequences for capturing and using Time but my 
girlfriend never seemed to be overly concerned. And, as I said 
already, she won&#39;t tell me any details whenever I ask.
	Everything came to a climax at the beginning of the week. It was 
April 1, start of the new grade and Sakura&#39;s birthday. I had spent 
practically the whole weekend preparing a special treatment just for 
my special girlfriend. I had hoped that would help relax her a little 
and maybe she&#39;d open up to me. Not that I would have pressed.
	I had everything set, Okaasan was on a business trip and I had 
sent most of the serving stuff home. I told Sakura to come over after 
her club practice (she&#39;s still doing cheerleading but most of it 
half-heartedly, she actually has joined the Choir club so that we 
could spent even more time together). And so I sat there, alone in the 
big house and waited for Sakura.
	Sakura didn&#39;t come.
	At first I became worried that something might have happened so 
I called her on our private phones, only to discover that Sakura had 
turned off hers, something I discovered she was almost always doing 
when working with the cards. I considered going over and looking for 
myself but something in me was rebelling and refused to just chase 
after my errand girlfriend. A feeling rather new and unusual for me. I 
usually tended to defend Sakura&#39;s actions even if I should by all 
standards be angry with some. For me Sakura&#39;s happiness had always 
been valued higher than anyone else&#39;s - including my own. Ironically 
enough, thinking about it now, the anger might be a result of Sakura&#39;s 
own doing. The brunette was so adamant about our relationship that she 
had practically made me speak my mind more often, whenever something 
is bothering me or I just need to talk to her, she made it very clear, 
that she will always be there for me, insisting for me to confide in 
her always.
	I was still worried but I knew that if something happened to 
Sakura I would know it. I had known in my heart if she was in danger. 
Besides, she&#39;d never turn off that phone other than for her magical 
studies that she was so secretive about. So I waited, and Sakura 
didn&#39;t come.
	Next morning I confronted her before school. Turns out she 
&quot;forgot&quot;! She forgot about her own private birthday party with her 
girlfriend?! I might have bought that from the innocent ten-year old 
before the whole time travel incident but not from her, not now. And 
then she had the audacity to brush me off with a feeble apology that 
she &quot;is not feeling well&quot;.
	To quote Sakura: Hoe?
	Sakura doesn&#39;t just simply feel &quot;not well&quot;. My girlfriend is the 
healthiest girl I know, really. She&#39;s so full of energy that she&#39;s 
almost bursting most of the time. While it has been much more reserved 
since her change it is still there. It&#39;s something so typical Sakura 
that you can&#39;t miss it after having seen it once.
	And what shocked me more and is still puzzling me is that look 
she gave me. Sakura almost seemed scared, not off me, but maybe 
something having to do with me. And that scared me in return. Having 
Sakura look so... lost... and as if the devil was chasing her (I 
really can&#39;t describe it any better) was disconcerting to say the 
least.
	All throughout the day and the next morning almost no word had 
been spoken between us. I think that was the longest ever since we&#39;ve 
been together and not separated by vacation or other things. And I 
swear the whole school seemed to have picked up on it. Even some of 
the teachers who usually loved to focus their attention on us made a 
point not to.
	Tuesday afternoon I finally had enough. I was confused about all 
of this but I was also feeling uncharacteristically angry. I wanted to 
know what was going on. I didn&#39;t see what I could have done wrong and 
Sakura would neither speak up on her own or come over as she usually 
did. And that devastating silence was straining my nerves. So then, 
finally, I went over to the Kinomoto house and practically marched 
into her room (the look on Touya&#39;s face would have been priceless if I 
hadn&#39;t been in such a foul mood).
	I had secretly hoped to find Sakura sitting on her desk, working 
with her cards or something like that. That way I would have at least 
had somewhere to start but that didn&#39;t stop or slow me down any. I 
think, analyzing it now, most of my feelings weren&#39;t so much anger as 
they were frustration, frustration fueled by worry and the uncertainty 
of what was going on with my girlfriend. She is the most important 
thing in my life and I think I deserve to know what is going on in her 
life. She told me pretty much the same after all. Doesn&#39;t she trust me 
with this? I was... still am a little hurt about that. Maybe it&#39;s 
unfair to feel like that but I really can&#39;t help it at the moment.
	When I told her all that, told her that I wanted to know what 
was going on, why she was shutting me out from her magical studies and 
why she never told me about the future. I wanted to know, even if it 
might not be pleasant. I am sure she was trying to protect me in some 
way and I am grateful for that, but I am also still her girlfriend and 
couldn&#39;t just stand by letting Sakura worry herself all on her own.
	I am still mulling over her response. Sakura actually apologized 
for being so absent lately and that she was doing very important 
things that had to be taken care off. And that there were some things 
she couldn&#39;t tell me yet... I swear I could hear the &quot;I tell you if 
you are older&quot; behind the words (again d&eacute;j&agrave; vu) and that really leaves 
me puzzled. Sakura rarely makes comments likes that or treats anyone 
as if she is really those seven years older. And it&#39;s not just an act 
but rather genuine from what I can tell.
	Before I could come up with any sort of response she had gently 
but persistently made me leave, saying she had some things to do, 
alone, and that right now she couldn&#39;t be distracted. And THAT really 
hurt. It felt like Sakura was purposefully trying to put distance 
between us. As if she was afraid that something might happen if we 
were too close right now.
	I have the very distinct feeling that I am missing something 
obvious here but I just can&#39;t put my finger on it.
	This had been about three days ago and apart from sporadic talk 
in school, there had been a deep wedge between us and I simply felt 
terrible about it. Logically seen there was no reason for me to feel 
at fault but this state was becoming unbearable. Being so close to my 
one and true love and yet so far away... I feel like I am going to 
explode any moment now!
	No, I didn&#39;t really feel at fault. However, I felt extremely 
worried and a little ashamed at my reaction. After all everyone had 
their secrets, so why should Sakura be an exception. How could I know 
that with my intense reaction I might have even made it worse than it 
actually was? Also she had sacrificed so much by traveling back in 
time, she gave up Syaoran to be with me. I should by all means be 
thankful.
	Yet, the fact remained that I was worried. For Sakura and for 
us. I feel very lucky to have such a fierce protector, nevertheless 
this had reached a point where I felt utterly excluded from things. 
Doesn&#39;t she understand that seeing her worried and in pain, pains me 
equally? How can she expect by shutting me out not to make me worry? I 
have to know what is going on and I will...
	Yes, my decision is made. Tomorrow I will go over and find out 
what all this is about. I might not like it but that should be for me 
to decide. I wanted my girlfriend back, all the pros and cons about 
her, nothing less. I will apologize for being so angry but I will also 
make sure that she knows that I am worried about her and that all I 
want to do is help her. We have always been together through so many 
things. The school problems at the beginning of last year hadn&#39;t 
managed to drive a wedge between us, so I won&#39;t let this thing 
(whatever it is) either. Sakura has to realize that and I will make 
her realize it!
	Reading back over that last paragraph, I think I sound rather 
scary... Hah, I feel a lot better now. Tomorrow I will make sure to 
fix whatever is burdening our relationship or at least to share that 
burden with Sakura. Thanks, Diary, sometimes it&#39;s nice to have 
somewhere to write all this down and analyze your thoughts. That 
really helped me today.

******************************

April 7, 1997

	Some time ago, someone - I am not sure who - said to me that too 
much wisdom, too much knowledge poisons the mind. It sounded like the 
words of a wise man then and even more so now. I wonder if I would 
have been better off listening to them...
	Okay, that sounds very gloomy. There is enough motivation for 
that though. Thinking my dearest Sakura had to go through all... 
this... terrible... &#39;things&#39;. I had wanted to know. Now I knew and I 
feel a certain numbness and a deep sadness coming from that knowledge.
	But I am not making much sense to you, do I? So I better start 
from the beginning.
	My decision made I had wanted to go over early to Sakura and 
make her tell me about all that bothered her lately. That is where I 
got my first surprise, finding the demure and rather meek-looking 
brunette at my doorstep, appearing for all it was worth like a 
chastened child. I immediately felt sick in my heart, knowing that I 
was probably one of the main reasons for her state. After writing my 
thoughts down, I had lain awake for some time, regret beginning to 
plague me. Regret for some of the harsh words traded and the 
accusation I had so blindly uttered. I knew that something was 
troubling Sakura and that she just wanted to shield me from it. 
Certainly I hadn&#39;t done her a favor with my explosion of temper, as 
rare as it was.
	Therefore I was quick to assure her that I wasn&#39;t at all angry 
with her anymore when she practically begged for forgiveness. I felt 
so terrible that moment, seeing her so lost and obviously torn inside. 
How could I have ever even thought that she doesn&#39;t trust me? The 
appearance she gave yesterday morning spoke more than the revelation 
of any secret how devoted she is to me, how much she depends on my 
presence and love.
	After we had calmed down a little, Sakura asked me if I still 
wanted to know. She revealed that it might not make a difference 
anymore soon and she probably couldn&#39;t shield me from what was to 
come. As gentle as possible I made her see that I wanted to know 
EVERYTHING that was going on in her life. We were a couple, and 
couples share such things, they share everything. We were so close 
already and despite feeling like dirt at the moment, I hated to not 
being able to care for my Sakura properly, not knowing what it was 
that bothered her.
	Sakura just smiled at me a little sadly but with more fondness 
and love I had seen her do in a long while. And then she told me. 
Kami, yes, she told me... everything! I sat there just listening, numb 
with shock over some of the things that were revealed to me that very 
moment.
	I am not sure I should write all this down, I am not sure I even 
can. However, I feel that if someone ever reads this, they deserve to 
know about what that innocent, gentle creature had to go through, what 
kind of future she left behind by risking so much to come here and set 
things right. Set things right mostly for me. I don&#39;t think I really 
deserve that, I feel insignificant compared to Sakura&#39;s big heart. She 
had made clear to me that what she did wasn&#39;t done primarily in order 
to save the world from the terrible future she had witnessed but in 
the first place it was because of me. Her wish while confronting Time 
wasn&#39;t about setting things right for the world, that had only been in 
the back of her mind. Her sole motivation was for me and the love she 
felt she owed me. It&#39;s all so amazing and hard to believe, how can I 
even hope to compare to that with my meager devotion?
	Still, I wanted to tell you of what happened in that future 
Sakura left and might as well do so. Everything started out as 
normally as you may expect. Sakura and Syaoran were happy. All three 
of us had stuck together all the way up to and through High School. It 
was after graduation that IT happened. No one on Earth at that time 
truly knew what exactly caused it, where the malevolent creature came 
from. However, when She began to emerge and reign terror on the cities 
of the planet it was like the very definition of hell, many brave 
warriors and magicians fell to Her infinite seeming power. In the 
matter of a few month the world became a place darker than night, 
filled with death and despair.
	In Greek mythology there is a tale about a box that the first 
woman on Earth opened because she was curious. This box harbored all 
of the humanity&#39;s darker emotion. Fear, jealousy, hate, greed, bigotry 
(you can continue that list endlessly). The woman was named Pandora 
and the box had become known as Pandora&#39;s Box. I am not sure whether 
it is a coincidence, a connection or just the perverted humor of fate 
but the creature that had wrecked havoc in Sakura&#39;s future had been 
aptly named Pandora as well.
	The little Sakura described about her still sent shivers down my 
spine, thinking about the emotions alone I saw in her normally vivid 
and cheerful eyes and heard in her soft, whispered tones. Fear. There 
was fear. Not anger or loathing or rage at the unbelievable things 
that evil creature had done to her and Earth. Those emotions were 
there too, but they were insignificant compared to the fear and the 
terror emitting from Sakura speaking of her experience. Eriol said 
that Sakura was the strongest mage on Earth now and to just think 
about something or someone evoking such strong reactions from my 
beloved is... unsettling doesn&#39;t even begin to describe it.
	Pandora had turned Earth into a world of terror and fear and 
there was no one able to stop her path of destruction. Sakura 
described her as something very old, totally incapable of having 
positive emotion. Her whole being was a reflection, the epitome of any 
dark emotion you could come up with. Her whole purpose was to turn 
everything into oblivion in the most painful, torturous way possible. 
Her powers were so massive that compared to her Sakura&#39;s own seemed 
like comparing an ant with an elephant.
	And the worst part is, Sakura steadfastly believes that the same 
thing might happen again very soon if she doesn&#39;t do something about 
it in advance.
	That is what she has been doing the last months, using the cards 
to predict the future and possible chances to prevent the fate that 
had befallen her own time from happening here. I cried for Sakura&#39;s 
grief at her description at how Pandora had come for her as well and 
how she had to watch first Syaoran&#39;s death and then my own. She 
visibly relieved that moment and it was a torturing experience. I 
realized then that it must have been that moment that Sakura finally 
realized my feelings and that still makes me choke back an angry sob. 
That is not how I would have wanted Sakura to find out. I know she was 
caring so much for all those close to her and that she could never 
live with my death. That is why I had sworn to myself that even if 
Sakura ended up with Syaoran and we drifted apart, I wouldn&#39;t do 
anything rash and stupid. I know I would just make Sakura sad and hate 
herself and that is a thought I cannot stand.
	I had to hold and reassure her for almost half an hour before 
she managed to calm down. I smoothed the embarrassment Sakura felt at 
having broken down like that immediately, making sure that she knows I 
would and will never do anything like this on purpose. Not that I have 
a reason now but it was very important at that moment to soothe those 
fears.
	I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to do or say to soothe her fears about 
Pandora though. Sakura hadn&#39;t even done more when describing 
superficially what happened and I can tell where is a lot still left 
untold (which right now really isn&#39;t much of a bad thing). Just from 
watching how terrified the usually brave and determined girl was of 
that evil creature put me at a loss for words. What could little, 
unimportant me do after all? All I managed was that weak reminder of 
her magic phrase again. Everything would surely be alright. Yeah sure, 
I am quite sure I had said the same thing in her future and I know now 
that it hadn&#39;t helped a tiny bit.
	Thinking along these lines I was rather surprised to find Sakura 
looking at me with a serious expression, a flicker of that 
breathtaking determination in her eyes. Then she said the absolutely 
sweetest thing. That this phrase held little meaning without me there. 
I breathed life into the phrase, gave it a purpose, a direction. That 
as long as I was there that everything WILL always be alright. And 
that because of me and us being together, my love fueling her, pushing 
me onward, she might be able to change the future and make it better 
for us. That is why she had pushed herself so hardly lately, to 
prevent all this from happening. For me.
	ME.
	Wow.
	My expression must have been priceless that moment. But Sakura 
didn&#39;t express her obviously humor, just a fond, loving smile, 
followed by a kiss so sensual and utterly devouring I felt like I was 
being sucked right into her. My body is still shaking from the 
feelings coursing through me. I could feel all the pent up 
frustrations of the last months but also all the love she felt for me. 
I realized then that until that moment that as much as I thought I 
knew how lucky I was, how much Sakura loved me and was willing to give 
for me, I never had completely understood.
	I am not sure if we can weather that storm. I really am not as 
much as I wish to fuel myself but... I will have faith in Sakura and 
if she wishes me to be by her side, supporting her as much as I can, 
then I will. I will believe in my angel, my savior. If anyone can do 
it, she can.

THE END (for now)

Author&#146;s Notes

Okay, this might seem a little cut off and doesn&#146;t explain everything, 
probably only serves to open up more questions. But that was wholly 
intended that way. I think I revealed already more than I wanted at 
that point anyway.
This is after all part of a bigger project, a background story so to 
say but you can read it as a stand alone as well (I hope). There will 
be one more part (split into two) that will tie things up for the 
background story and Sakura and Tomoyo&#146;s involvement. Seeing that Maia 
seems to have a good inspiration streak right now, you may see it 
sooner than you think.
Don&#146;t worry Sailormoon fans as I said this will tie into a bigger 
project and you will soon get to see something of it (always assuming 
Maia complies).

Some things to clear up.
First off, I changed a tiny amount of things in &#147;The Different Path&#148;. 
No real revision but more little details that are necessary. I am a 
perfectionist than writing, especially concerning facts like a working 
timeline that makes sense. I realized that the birth year given for 
Tomoyo on her tombstone has actually to be one year earlier or she&#146;ll 
end up younger than Sakura. Why this might be possible, it doesn&#146;t 
work out for the timeline of the greater project. That&#146;s really all 
you need to know about the changes that really matter.
I hope I haven&#146;t made too much tense errors in this one. Writing diary 
entries is always a little difficult because you really have to watch 
what is reflection and what has to be present or future tense. I am 
not native (not that after all the time writing English I want to 
stick to that excuse) and don&#146;t get those stories betaed at the 
moment, so hopefully you can overlook some grammatical mistakes.
Anyway, there is really not much to say about the story itself. It was 
fun writing it this way, in diary format. That&#146;s the first time I did 
a story completely that way and I enjoyed it. I think I had less 
trouble writing Tomoyo than I had writing Sakura, hopefully you like 
the result. The next story will probably be a mixture of both.

So, see you at the next installment, hopefully some time soon. 
Comments are always appreciated and I wanted to seize the opportunity 
and thank all the kind reviewers for &#147;The Different Path&#148;.

Ja ne, yours
