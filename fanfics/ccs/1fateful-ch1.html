<h1>One Fateful Day (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nanaimo.html">nanaimoanimefan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hello everyone. My name is Marc, and this is a story that just popped 
into my head one night. Originally, I was going to make this a smutty 
story that just ended up with Sakura and Tomoyo in bed together. But, 
after I started writing, things just kept coming to me that made me want 
to change it. I tried my best to show how difficult it was for them to 
confess their love to each other and to their family and friends. This 
is my first attempt at writing a Fan-Fic, and I&#39;d like to hear what 
other people think of it. So please, after you read this, E-mail me and 
tell me what you thought of it... Whether or not you liked it, what you 
would change, etc, etc. My E-mail address will be at the end of this 
story. Once again, Thank You.  

My story takes place when Sakura and her friends are about 14 and have 
started their 2nd year of Jr High school. Shaoran and Meilin have left 
Japan to travel and study abroad.  

A TRUE FRIEND. 

&quot;Sakura!!&quot; Called out Tomoyo. 

&quot;Hey Tomoyo! Something wrong?&quot; 

&quot;No, I just wanted to ask you if you were doing anything later.&quot; 

&quot;Not that I know of.&quot; Said Sakura. 

&quot;Good, I made you a new Battle Costume yesterday and I was wondering if 
I could come over to your place after school and get you to try it on.&quot; 

&quot;Sure Tomoyo, no problem, Touya is going to work after school so he 
won&#39;t be around to bother and make fun of us.&quot; 

&quot;Great.&quot; Said Tomoyo. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later then...bye!&quot; 

&quot;Bye Tomoyo!!&quot;  Sakura was in a very cheery mood as she Rollerbladed 
home on this beautiful day, as she rounded a corner she ended up 
crashing into a man she didn&#39;t notice walking down the street towards 
her. 

&quot;OW!!! I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; Sakura said bowing to the man repeatedly. &quot;Please 
forgive me!&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s ok.&quot; Said the man, &quot;I forgive you. But, are you ok Sakura?&quot; 

Sakura looks up surprised, &quot;how did you...? Oh!! Yukito! I&#39;m sorry, I 
didn&#39;t realize it was you.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s ok.&quot; Said Yukito. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. So what the rush Sakura?&quot; 

Embarrassed, she looks up at him and says that she&#39;s on her way home to 
get ready for when Tomoyo shows up with a new Battle Costume for her. 

&quot;Oh that&#39;s nice.&quot; Says Yukito, &quot;I&#39;ll have to come over someday so you 
can show me.&quot; 

&quot;Sure!!&quot; Sakura yells, I&#39;d like that. 

&quot;Well, I have to get going now or I&#39;ll be late for work.&quot; 

&quot;Ok.&quot; Says Sakura &quot;I&#39;ll see you later then...bye!&quot; 

&quot;Bye Sakura!! Say Hi to your dad for me, and tell Touya I&#39;ll see him at 
work.&quot; 

&quot;OK!! Bye Yukito!!&quot;  

If she were still in Elementary School Sakura wouldn&#39;t be able to stop 
thinking about Yukito, but being older now, her love has faded for him 
and has turned toward another. 

As she walks in the door she yells out to Kero that she&#39;s home. 

&quot;I&#39;m in the Kitchen.&quot; He replies, his mouth stuffed with sweets. 

&quot;I should have known.&quot; Says Sakura. &quot;Don&#39;t eat all the sweets Kero, 
Tomoyo is coming over with a new Battle Costume for me and I want to 
save some of those for when she gets here.&quot; 

As they head up to her room Sakura tells Kero about her literally 
bumping into Yukito on her way home and how she remembered that she had 
a crush on him when she was younger. 

&quot;Do you still love him?&quot; Asked Kero. 

&quot;No, not anymore.&quot; Said Sakura, &quot;My love has changed towards someone who 
has always been there for me, even through troubled and uncertain 
times.&quot; 

As usual Kero can&#39;t keep his mind off food and asks when Tomoyo will be 
coming over. 

&quot;I wish I could tell this person how I feel about them.&quot; Says Sakura. 
&quot;But I have no idea how, or even if this person will love me in return.&quot; 
Her eyes started to fill with tears and her heart started to ache as she 
thought about this person and how she could come to tell them how she 
feels. 

As she entered her room she thought: &quot;Well, I guess I&#39;ll do some of my 
homework while I&#39;m waiting&quot;. She sits down at her desk and pulls out her 
homework. 

&quot;Shoot!! I forgot my Calculator at school! I know!! Maybe Touya has one 
in his room. I think I&#39;ll go take a quick look.&quot; She says. 

&quot;WAIT!!&quot; yells Kero. &quot;Don&#39;t you remember what Touya said he would do if 
he caught you snooping around his room again?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; Says Sakura. &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;ll have to be careful not to get 
caught.&quot; 

&quot;Well count me out of it.&quot; Says Kero. &quot;I&#39;m going outside to take a nap.&quot; 

&quot;Ok.&quot; Says Sakura as she heads for Touya&#39;s room. 

As she looks around the room trying to figure out where the calculator 
might be, she doesn&#39;t realize that Touya is walking up the porch stairs 
and coming in the front door. 

Touya closes the door and sits down to take off his shoes. &quot;Oh man what 
a day!&quot; He says. &quot;Crap, and I&#39;ve got to go to work soon too.&quot; 

As Touya walks up the stairs he hears a noise coming from his room, It&#39;s 
Sakura still searching for the Calculator. 

As he gets to the top of the stairs he sees that his bedroom door is 
open a little bit. When he opens it all the way he finds a big mess and 
Sakura going through his desk. 

Caught off guard Sakura sees him and drops a book on the floor with 
papers scattering everywhere. Furious at seeing this Touya shoots Sakura 
a very angry look and walks over to her.  

Scared Sakura puts up her hands to protect herself. But to her surprise 
he just grabs her arm and says:  

&quot;What are you doing in my room Sakura!? I told you what would happen if 
I caught you snooping around in here again!&quot; 

&quot;No, please Touya don&#39;t!!&quot;  

It was no use, he grabbed the chair from his desk and sat down in it. 

&quot;No Touya!! Please!! I promise I&#39;ll never do it again!!&quot; 

Before she knew it she was over his knees. Skirt lifted, Panties pulled 
down and she was being Spanked!! 

SMACK!! SMACK!! SMACK!! &quot;OW!! OW!! STOP PLEASE!! TOUYA! OW!! IT HURTS!!&quot;  

&quot;Good...maybe this will teach you to listen to me and take me seriously 
for a change!!&quot; 

&quot;OW!! OW!!&quot;  

Sakura&#39;s bottom was now blistering with pain and started getting pink. 

&quot;OW!! OW!! OW!! she cried I&#39;M SORRY!! I&#39;LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN I PROMISE!! 
OW!!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll bet you won&#39;t.&quot; SMACK!! SMACK!! &quot;If I catch you in here without my 
permission again you&#39;ll get a lot worse understand?&quot; 

SMACK!! SMACK!!  &quot;YES! OW!! I UNDERSTAND!  OW!! OW!!  PLEASE STOP!! 
OW!!&quot; 

After a few more good smacks he decides that she&#39;s had enough. He tries 
to pull up her underpants and lets her get up. 

She stands in front of him after he lets her up, drying her eyes. She 
then fixes her twisted and half pulled up Panties while Touya is talking 
to her. 

&quot;Tomoyo is coming over later isn&#39;t she?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; Says Sakura timidly. 

&quot;Ok, well I have to go to work soon so I won&#39;t be here to watch you 
girls. I want you two to behave yourselves while I&#39;m gone understand?&quot; 

&quot;I understand.&quot; Said Sakura. 

&quot;I&#39;m getting hungry so I&#39;m going downstairs to get something to eat then 
I&#39;m heading off to work Ok? Why don&#39;t you go and wait in your room for 
Tomoyo, I&#39;ll send her up when she gets here.&quot; 

&quot;Ok.&quot; 

Sakura heads off to her room rubbing her now blistering backside on the 
way. 

As Touya is in the kitchen making his snack there&#39;s a knock at the door, 
it&#39;s Tomoyo. 

&quot;Hi Touya.&quot; She says. 

&quot;Hey Tomoyo, Sakura&#39;s up in her room.&quot; 

&quot;Ok, Thank you.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m heading off to work so I want you two to behave yourselves 
understand?&quot; 

Tomoyo stood there for a minute in a daze. 

&quot;Sakura and me...all alone?&quot; She thought. 

Tomoyo knew for a while that Sakura has had something on her mind for 
quite a while now, and this was her chance to find out what it was 
without having to worry about anyone else overhearing them. 

&quot;Tomoyo? Tomoyo!!&quot; Said Touya loudly. 

&quot;Oh, sorry about that, I was just day dreaming.&quot; 

&quot;Do you understand what I told you?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s ok, I&#39;ll see you girls later.&quot; 

&quot;Bye Touya! Say hi to Yukito for me.&quot;  

&quot;Bye Tomoyo...see you later.&quot; 

Tomoyo cheerfully picks up her things and heads for Sakura&#39;s room. </pre>
