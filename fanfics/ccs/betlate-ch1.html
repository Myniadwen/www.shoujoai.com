<h1>Better Late then Never</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ccs/index.html">Card Captor Sakura</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/purgatorywizard.html">The Purgatory Wizard</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Tomoyo looked down at her watch. &quot;She&#39;s late!&quot; Tomoyo whispered to 
herself with worry in her voice. She looked around the mall, but saw 
no Sakura. &quot;Where could she be?&quot; she whispered again. This was to be 
their first real &quot;date&quot; since Tomoyo confessed her love to Sakura. 
Tomoyo was shocked that Sakura felt the same way and was eager to 
return her feelings to Tomoyo. They had been spending a lot of time 
together since then, but had never really gone on a date. That is what 
made this day so special to Tomoyo.

Tomoyo started to squirm nervously in her seat. &quot;Maybe she isn&#39;t going 
to show up after all&quot; Tomoyo thought looking down at her watch again.

&quot;Maybe she doesn&#39;t love me after all.&quot; Tomoyo felt a tear stream down 
her face. Tomoyo wiped her face and tried to hide her sadness from the 
passersby. She tried to straighten up and look happy, but it was no 
use, she was to devastated. Sakura was already close to two hours 
late. Tomoyo wanted to run home and lock herself in her room and stay 
in there until she died, but something inside of her told her to stay. 
She remembered an old saying she had once heard, &quot;With patience comes 
great rewards.&quot;

After many conflicts with herself she decided to wait a little longer. 
Why am I doing this?&quot; She thought to herself. &quot;I know she isn&#39;t going 
to show up!&quot;

Tomoyo stood up and was preparing to leave when she heard it.

&quot;Tomoyo!&quot;

Tomoyo quickly turned around and skimmed the crowd. Sakura was 
standing directly across from her waving her hands in the air. Tomoyo 
immediately dropped what she was holding. &quot;She showed up after all!&quot; 
Tomoyo said in complete shock, &quot;I can&#39;t believe it!&quot;

Sakura started to run acrros the room towards Tomoyo. Tomoyo took in 
every one of Sakura&#39;s graceful steps.

&quot;You are late Ms. Sakura&quot; Tomoyo said playfully, putting her hands on 
her hips,&quot;Do you know how long I have been waiting here?&quot;

&quot;I am SO sorry!&quot; Sakura said apologetically&quot; I can explain!&quot;

&quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry about it. I am just glad you showed up. Tomoyo said 
with her voice full of happiness.

The couple embraced. They didn&#39;t care who was looking or what anyone 
thought. All they cared about was each other.</pre>
