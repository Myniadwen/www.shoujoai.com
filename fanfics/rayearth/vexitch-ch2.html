<h1>Vexatious Itch (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rayearth/index.html">Magic Knight Rayearth</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lilybunny.html">Lilybunny</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../rayearth/vexitch-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Hikaru, come on! Let go!&quot; Umi growled loudly. She didn&#146;t want to be 
too loud for fear of waking up Fuu. Because they all knew what 
happened when Fuu is woken up. God. Umi shuddered. 

Hikaru giggled dreamily and started to drool onto Umi&#146;s shoulder, 
causing the blue-haired girl to groan in disgust. Then a loud snore 
erupted from the small girl making Fuu stir. Umi gasped. &#145;Go back to 
sleep, go back to sleep, go back to sleep&#133;&#146; she mentally urged the 
blonde knight. Fuu turned over a bit, sighed heavily and resumed her 
slumber.

With a mental sigh, Umi turned her attention back to Hikaru. &quot;Dammit 
Hikaru!&quot; she whispered. Umi was getting annoyed with this. She HATED 
when Hikaru snuggled in her sleep! She did this all the time back in 
Cephiro! She&#146;d either nearly strangle Umi or roll on top of her. Umi 
rolled her eyes.

When she tried to push Hikaru off, Hikaru let out a loud, disturbed 
snort. &#145;No! No noise!&#146; Umi cringed. &#145;Don&#146;t wake up Fuu you idiot!&#146; she 
cursed in her head. Finally she was able to pry Hikaru&#146;s arms from 
around her neck and shove her over. Umi then made a weird face when 
her small friend made an odd &quot;gaaaahh&#133;&quot; sound and slept. 

&#145;God&#133;&#146; Umi thought, sighing inwardly. &#145;Who knows what would have 
happened if Fuu has woken up&#133;&#146; but Umi didn&#146;t even want to think about 
that. She settled back onto her pillow as she felt sleep tug at her 
eyelids. Just when she felt herself begin to fall asleep, a 
horrendously loud snort filled her ears. Her eyelids snapped open and 
she whipped her head to the side. Hikaru&#146;s mouth was wide open, and 
she was on her back, snoring. &#145;Shit!&#146; Umi thought. &#145;Hikaru always 
snores when she&#146;s on her back.!&#146; More thunderous snores fled Hikaru&#146;s 
wide open mouth, sounding like a truck-blast in a vacuum. &#145;God dammit, 
Fuu&#146;s gonna for sure wake up now!&#146; she thought, filled with terror. 

So before Hikaru could let out another snorting, wheezing honk, Umi 
reached out with her leg and kicked the red-knight viciously, turning 
her over onto her side. The snores abruptly stopped, and some muffled 
mumbling could be heard. When Hikaru turned onto her other side to 
face Umi, she had stopped making noise all together and slept 
peacefully.

Umi sighed and looked at Fuu cautiously. Her friend had stirred a bit 
and now had one leg hanging over the edge of the bed, but remained 
asleep.

Once again, Umi collapsed onto her pillow in deep fatigue. Next time 
she had the girls over she&#146;d put a jar on Hikaru&#146;s head. 

But for some reason now, Umi couldn&#146;t fall back asleep. She was 
extremely tired; she could feel it in her bones but&#133;now it was like 
there was tape on her eyelids, keeping them open. &#145;Damn.&#146; Umi thought. 
&#145;If I don&#146;t fall back asleep tonight then in the morning I&#146;m going to 
kick Hikaru out of a window when she&#146;s brushing her teeth.&#146; She 
smiled. Such sweet revenge.

WHAP! Umi yelped loudly and covered her mouth quickly when she felt 
another blast of pain shot from her nose to her brain and back several 
times. Pink, blue, red, yellow, green, and orange colors danced in her 
eyes, blurring her vision and causing tears to stream down her cheeks. 
And this time she was hit in her eyes! &#145;God&#133;that&#146;s gonna hurt later.&#146;

After the colors faded to black once again (&#133;fade to black&#133;) Umi 
turned her head to see Hikaru&#146;s stupid hand almost touching her nose. 
She felt a surge of anger rise in her, and then a wave of fear. &#145;Oh 
no&#133;she only does that when&#133;she&#133;no!&#146; Umi couldn&#146;t finish her thoughts, 
for it was done. Hikaru had indeed done what Umi knew she would do. 
Hikaru clung to Umi like a ladder and this time refused to let go.

&#145;You idiot dumb stupid airhead jerk bum bitch stupid head!&#146; A long 
discourse of curses and names filled Umi&#146;s head as the red-haired girl 
snuggled against her. 

Umi was about to hit Hikaru, and good, when she felt a finger touch 
her cheek. She looked over in puzzlement to see Hikaru&#146;s arm, hand, 
and then finger stroking her face. She raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Hikaru?&quot; she said softly. Then she rolled her eyes. &#145;Yeah, like she 
heard me, she sleeps like a damn rock&#146;

So she reached over and grabbed Hikaru&#146;s hand, squeezing it. But 
before she could properly throw Hikaru across the room and off of her, 
a small leg crossed her stomach and she felt a light weight on her. 
&quot;Hikaru!&quot; she yelled. Hikaru had nearly straddled Umi&#146;s waist. &quot;Get 
off!&quot;

&quot;Mmmm&#133;&quot; Hikaru moaned. Umi looked up. 

&quot;Hikaru wake up and get off dammit!&quot; she cursed, not caring if Fuu 
woke up at all. Because as far as she was concerned, Fuu could just 
kiss her ass and damn well like it.

&quot;Mmmmtissssmmmmm&quot; Hikaru mumbled in Umi&#146;s ear. Umi gagged. But a 
shiver ran down her spine when she felt Hikaru&#146;s hot breath on her 
neck. &quot;Oh Lantis&#133;..&quot; Hikaru managed to mumble. 

Then Umi&#146;s eyes opened the widest they had ever opened when she felt 
Hikaru turn her face towards hers and felt their lips press together. 
Hikaru completely straddled her now and was pressing her small chest 
against her own madly. 

Umi was unable to move, perhaps out of pure shock. 
&#145;Hikaru&#133;hikaru&#133;.is&#133;.she&#146;s&#133;.and&#133;&#146; was all Umi managed to think. But 
then she realized that that irritating deep down itch had disappeared 
momentarily. &#145;What is this?&#146; she thought. 

As Hikaru continued to kiss her friend, Umi slowly rose shaky hands 
and gently placed them on Hikaru&#146;s tiny hips. Umi closed her eyes and 
reached her arms all the way around Hikaru, pulling her into a tight 
embrace. Hikaru&#146;s lips were unnaturally soft and warm, like silky 
soft&#133;frilly&#133;.

Umi snorted at herself, And when she pulled Hikaru away she opened her 
eyes just in time to see Hikaru&#146;s fly open.
