<h1>Farewell, Hikaru</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rayearth/index.html">Magic Knight Rayearth</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kamui.html">Kamui Ikari</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hi!! As I promised, this is my first Hikaru/Umi yuri fic, also the 
first yuri fic that I made I hope that you like it. It can have 
possible gramtical errors. Is settled after the end of manga.

Please: I want Feedback, with your opinion I can make more stories and 
I will know if you like it or don&#39;t.

------------------------------------------------------------

Hikaru is still asleep, her red hair is unbraided and is hugging a 
bear that Umi gave her when she won it in a fair where Hikaru, Umi and 
Fuu went. Finally Hikaru wakes up thanks to the sunbeams that settle 
on her face; she rises and while she&#39;s changing is looking a picture, 
in that picture is she, Umi and Fuu all smiling. &quot;I would like this 
picture forever, the three of us together.&quot; Finally Hikaru finishes 
changing when the telephone rings.

&quot;Yes? It&#39;s Hikaru.&quot;

&quot;Hikaru? It&#39;s me, Umi.&quot;

&quot;Ah Umi, you have something to tell?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I have something to tell, but I wanted to know if you have 
something to do today,&quot; Umi asks.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t have anything,&quot; Hikaru answers.

&quot;Then we can see each other in the mall near your house in one hour?&quot; 
Umi asks.

&quot;Sure, I&#39;ll call Fuu and we&#39;ll go there.&quot;

&quot;Hikaru, don&#39;t call Fuu, what I want to speak with you about should be 
between us, all right?&quot; Umi says in a sad tone.

&quot;Yes, sure,&quot; Hikaru says surprised.

&quot;Then we&#39;ll see each other in one hour,&quot; Umi says and hangs up.

Hikaru hangs the telephone confused. &quot;It&#39;s strange, I never heard Umi 
that way.&quot; Hikaru goes to her dresser and see what clothes she will 
wear to meet with Umi.

------------------------------------------------------------

Hikaru is in the mall waiting for Umi, she looks at her watch.

&quot;It&#39;s almost going to be one hour and Umi still isn&#39;t here,&quot; Hikaru 
thinks, waiting in the door. While she&#39;s observing people she checks 
her watch again and sees that it&#39;s 1 minute to an hour.

&quot;One minute left,&quot; Hikaru thinks.

Suddenly Hikaru sees Umi coming down the street. Umi is walking 
distracted but she sees Hikaru and goes towards her.

&quot;Hi, Hikaru, thank you for coming,&quot; Umi says.

&quot;No problem, Umi, aren&#39;t we friends?&quot; Hikaru replies.

&quot;By the way, what&#39;s that you want to tell me?&quot; Hikaru asks more 
seriously.

&quot;Hikaru, why we don&#39;t go for a walk somewhere around, watch some movie 
and go eat somewhere? After that I will explain to you everything,&quot; 
Umi tells her.

&quot;Well...&quot; Hikaru answers.

After this the two girls began to walk down the streets, seeing malls, 
watching a movie and eating somewhere, after that they got photos of 
them, Umi asks Hikaru to get photos of her, Hikaru agrees and she gets 
a series of photos that Umi pays and keeps them.

Among so many things, the night is coming and Umi decides to take 
Hikaru to a place.

------------------------------------------------------------

Umi leads Hikaru to one of the many parks there are in Tokyo. This one 
is full of cherry blossom trees and there is a big lake. Umi stays 
behind Hikaru, while Hikaru observes astonishedly how beautiful the 
park is.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful, isn&#39;t it, Hikaru?&quot; Umi asks.

&quot;I love it; it is beautiful,&quot; Hikaru says happily.

But when Hikaru turns she is surprised that Umi is smiling but at the 
same time tears are falling down her cheeks. Hikaru is still while Umi 
continues smiling but her crying continues; she&#39;s crying.

&quot;Umi, what&#39;s happenning?&quot; Hikaru asks.

Umi wipes away her tears and lowers her head. Hikaru knows that 
something is wrong, very wrong, that something will happen and she is 
not ready for that. Finally Umi begins to speak.

&quot;Something happened, things appeared and they make that I...&quot; Umi says 
with a sad tone.

&quot;Do they make what?&quot; Hikaru asks Umi.

&quot;That I cannot fulfill the promise,&quot; Umi says.

Then Hikaru is paralyzed, she was not ready for what she heard, not 
ready for Umi&#39;s words. Hikaru begins to remember that when they 
returned to Tokyo, after the tragic battle that ended with the death 
of the Princess Esmeralda, she with Umi and Fuu made the promise that 
the three would be together no matter what happens, in good times or 
in bad, they made that promise under a cherry tree. Then they kept 
that promise, completing it many times, especially when Hikaru became 
the Cefiro&#39;s Pillar, always together, but now no longer.

Hikaru finally gets out of her astonishment and she observes that Umi 
sits down and leans against a tree; she keeps her head low.

&quot;Sit down, Hikaru, please. I will explain everything to you,&quot; Umi 
says.

Hikaru sits nearby, in fact beside her and she observes Umi maintains 
the low head and she doesn&#39;t dare to face her. Finally Umi inhales and 
begins to speak.

&quot;As I told you before, things happened and for that I can&#39;t fulfill 
the promise. You want to know what things, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;One week ago, I received an envelope that contained an invitation.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; Hikaru asks.

&quot;To go to the USA for six years.&quot; Umi says and becomes silent. Hikaru 
is shocked.

&quot;No, she belongs here, this is her place, here are her friends, me, 
Fuu, also she belongs to Cefiro where they are the others too,&quot; Hikaru 
thinks sadly.

Finally Umi lifts the head and she observes that Hikaru has tears, Umi 
wipes them away and begins to speak again.

&quot;The institute I go to has a contract with an institute of USA. 
Annually the best students receive this invitation. I was not the 
exception although sometimes I wanted not to be.&quot;

&quot;Umi...&quot; Hikaru says.

&quot;The previous week I felt so bad, my friends congratulating me and at 
the same time becoming sad because I must separate from them, my 
parents in the same situation and me because I didn&#39;t know what to 
do.&quot;

&quot;But, why you didn&#39;t say anything before?&quot; Hikaru asks.

&quot;Because if I told you before, you would begin to suffer,&quot; Umi says.

&quot;I didn&#39;t say anything, because I didn&#39;t want to worry you.&quot;

&quot;But Umi, you will leave, that&#39;s the point; that your friend leaves is 
to worry and the concern is bigger because you&#39;re not leaving for 
another part of Japan, you&#39;re going to the USA; it is not for a short 
time, it is for six years, and perhaps, I fear in that period you will 
forget all of us...even me,&quot; Hikaru says in a depressed tone.

Umi takes her hand triyng to make her feel better but she doesn&#39;t 
achieve it.

&quot;If you are sad, Cefiro will become a sad place, don&#39;t forget that you 
are the Cefiro&#39;s Pillar, if you are sad then disasters can occur,&quot; Umi 
says.

&quot;Besides, I won&#39;t forget anybody, my parents, the moments that we 
spent together there, Cefiro&#39;s people, the others; but I won&#39;t forget 
you, I never will forget you,&quot; Umi says with sincerity.

&quot;By the way, do you remember that a month and half ago when we went to 
Cefiro, when we returned you felt very bad and I had to comfort you 
because you began to cry disconsolately?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Hikaru answers.

&quot;Could you tell me what happened?&quot; Umi asks.

&quot;I went to Eagle&#39;s room to see him because finally he was recovered 
and I saw him and Lantis...naked and embracing each other in bed,&quot; 
Hikaru says.

Umi froze at the sound of that.

&quot;Hikaru...&quot;

&quot;I left the room without making noise. I was surprised and confused 
during the time that we were there, I faked being happy, but I was 
hurt, when we returned to Tokyo and when Fuu left for her house and we 
were alone, I couldn&#39;t face it, I couldn&#39;t,&quot; Hikaru says.

&quot;Hikaru...I...&quot;

&quot;I knew that Eagle was interested in Lantis, but I never thought that 
Lantis...that he...&quot; Hikaru tries to finish but Umi embraces her.

&quot;Don&#39;t speak if that makes you sad,&quot; Umi says trying to comfort her.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Umi, you wanted to know what happened, for that reason I 
wanted to talk.&quot;

&quot;What do you feel for Lantis?&quot; asks Umi

&quot;I felt admiration, respect, compassion for his suffering and love, 
but after that I felt the best was to leave them at both, to let them 
to be happy together,&quot; Hikaru says.

&quot;You really have a noble and generous heart; you are special,&quot; says 
Umi.

&quot;Can I ask you a question, ne?&quot; Hikaru says.

&quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;Do you know Ascot likes you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, finally I realized that he&#39;s in love with me.&quot;

&quot;And do you love him?&quot; asks Hikaru.

&quot;He is a good boy, but I see him as friend, nothing else,&quot; Umi says.

&quot;Are you in love, Umi?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I am.&quot;

&quot;I believed that you would never fall in love,&quot; Hikaru tells her.

&quot;I also thought that, but it simply passed,&quot; Umi says.

&quot;And when it happens, your vision of things changes,&quot; Umi says.

&quot;Who is that person?&quot; Hikaru says.

Umi doesn&#39;t answer, she&#39;s looking at Hikaru, Hikaru also observes her 
and for an instant their gazes locked onto each other when suddenly 
some drops begin to fall.

&quot;Hikaru, it&#39;s going to rain, let&#39;s go to Tokyo Tower!&quot; Umi says.

&quot;Yes!&quot;

The two girls leave running out of the park, finally it begins to rain 
but they arrive at Tokyo Tower and they ascend up.

&quot;Hikaru, did you get yourself wet?&quot; Umi asks her.

&quot;No, and you?&quot;

&quot;More or less,&quot; says Umi checking her hair.

&quot;Here is where I met you, where everything began: our adventures, our 
sufferings; here is where we went to Cephiro, here is where our lives 
changed, we always come here the three together but no more,&quot; says 
Hikaru in an out tone.

&quot;Hikaru....&quot; Umi says.

Suddenly, Hikaru hugs Umi and begins to cry.

&quot;I don&#39;t want you go away, if you leave, nothing will be the same, you 
always give me support, you helped me in the difficult moments, you 
were always there, but no more now, you will leave and I will be 
alone, but I cannot stop you, I&#39;m not nobody for that, I&#39;m not a 
worthy person for that, I&#39;m not,&quot; Hikaru says.

&quot;It&#39;s not true,&quot; Umi says and hugs Hikaru.

&quot;Yes it is, I&#39;m not nobody,&quot; Hikaru says.

&quot;No, you are Hikaru Shidou, you taught me many things, I owe you a 
lot, but the more important for me, you taught me what the true love 
is.&quot;

Hikaru is surprised.

&quot;Umi...you...&quot;

Umi looks at her with a smile.

&quot;Yes, the person that I&#39;m in love, the one that made me discover this 
beautiful and at the same time sad feeling, it&#39;s you Hikaru.&quot;

Umi rests Hikaru&#39;s head over her heart.

&quot;When I met you, I thought that you were a small girl due to your 
stature, when we fight against Alcione I said that you were as my 
little sister, with the time I began to respect you and admire you but 
I didn&#39;t know that would be transformed into something deeper. I 
didn&#39;t know what was happening to me really, when I was with you there 
was something inside myself that requested loudly being liberated, I 
felt the need to hug you, to have you among my arms, they were 
sensations that I never felt before butt that I sealed although they 
were for a while short. One day I finally discovered that what I feel 
for you is love, from there things changed.

&quot;You&#39;re the only person that surpassed my defenses, the only one that 
was able to make a road to the depths of my heart, you&#39;re the owner of 
my heart, my beloved Hikaru,&quot; Umi says.

&quot;Umi...I...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say anything, I gave myself to the fact that my feelings won&#39;t 
be returned, but I didn&#39;t care, the only thing that I want is to see 
you happy, that was enough. I saw you happy with Lantis, you were 
always cheerful and full of vitality and that was enough.&quot;

Umi releases Hikaru from her embrace and takes some steps back.

&quot;It&#39;s not easy to say a to person you love that person, especially 
when that person has the same sex as you. I never showed you my 
feelings because I was afraid of your reaction and losing your 
friendship; the trip forced me to take a determination, I discovered 
and I learned that should take risks, for that reason I decided that I 
will admit my feelings, for that reason I asked you not to call Fuu, 
because you are the only person that I want to say goodbye, the one 
that I will say &#39;Farewell&#39;.&quot;

Hikaru sees that Umi closes her eyes and tears are coming from them.

&quot;Hikaru, I want you to be honest, if you think that our friendship has 
been a simple illusion, a lie, from my confession, just say it. If you 
want to hate me and slap me just do it. This always happens here in 
Tokyo, I have seen boys and girls that admitted their love and they 
ended being hated by the ones they loved or their feelings won&#39;t be 
returned, mine will be one of them.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t hate you!!&quot; Hikaru screams at her.

Umi opens the eyes and sees Hikaru crying.

&quot;I can&acute;t hate you because it is not part of my nature to hate, I 
enjoyed and I enjoy the things that we have made together.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re making the same error that the Princess Esmeralda, you worry 
about my happiness but you&#39;re not happy, like her with Zagato, I don&#39;t 
want you to suffer.

&quot;For me, happiness is to be with all the people that I care about, but 
it is also to be with the person I love, after what happened with 
Lantis, I believed that I wouldn&#39;t fall in love again, but...you gave 
me that hope, the possibility of feel love again, the happiness for me 
is...be with you Umi.&quot;

Finally Hikaru finishes her crying and observes that Umi is surprised. 
She looks around the place and there is nobody in the rain, she comes 
closer to Umi, she is a few inches from Umi, both lock their gazes, 
gazing into each other for a few instants. Hikaru places her hands 
over Umi, one on Umi&#39;s waist and the other on Umi&#39;s shoulder. She 
lifts her head towards Umi, closing her eyes. Umi caresses Hikaru&#39;s 
right cheek smoothly and the red hair of her friend, smoothly inclines 
her head towards Hikaru who looks at her with a dreamy gaze and then 
their lips join. They close their eyes and they give themselves to the 
sensation, strange for both, a sensation that they can&#39;t describe, 
only feel. They kiss each other for a long time. Hikaru places a hand 
on the Umi&#39;s nape, her fingers traveling the down her soft hair, while 
Umi puts both hands on Hikaru&#39;s shoulders and finally they pull apart.

&quot;Aishiteru, Hikaru-koiishi,&quot; says Umi to Hikaru while she embraces 
her.

&quot;Aishiteru,&quot; says Hikaru, as they are embrace looking at each other.

&quot;Umi, when do you leave?&quot; Hikaru asks her.

&quot;Four days, I suppose,&quot; Umi answers.

&quot;Tomorrow we will go with Fuu to Cefiro, and we will make you a 
farewell party, but I want the other two days only for us,&quot; Hikaru 
says.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Umi says.

------------------------------------------------------------

The next day, the three girls go to Cefiro, where Umi tells the others 
the news, with the enthusiasm of Hikaru a farewell party is made. 
Although all were sad, the festival climate prevails.

After that, Hikaru and Umi go to many places, trying to make their 
date a fun one.

------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, on the third day, Hikaru and Umi go to the park that they 
went to before; both are under the sakura tree from last time.

&quot;Tomorrow is the day,&quot; Hikaru says sadly.

&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Umi says.

&quot;I will miss you...&quot; Hikaru says trying not to crying.

&quot;If you put that face, you&#39;re going to make me cry too,&quot; Umi says 
comforting her.

&quot;I can&#39;t avoid it, you will leave and will be gone for six long 
years.&quot;

&quot;But I will come to visit you some day, Hikaru.&quot;

&quot;I know you will come, but from tomorrow I will be alone, without the 
person I love,&quot; Hikaru says.

&quot;I feel that too,&quot; Umi says

Umi observes a sakura petal fall on the palm of her hand, then she 
grabs Hikaru&#39;s hand and joins her hand against Hikaru&#39;s.

&quot;Let&#39;s make a promise. I promise you that I will come to visit you 
every time that I can, but you have to promise me that you won&#39;t be 
sad, that you&#39;ll be happy and will make Cefiro a beautiful place 
during my absence,&quot; Umi says

&quot;I promise,&quot; Hikaru says.

Umi takes out her hair band and gives it to Hikaru.

&quot;This is for you; don&#39;t forget me and you know that I will be thinking 
of you,&quot; Umi says.

&quot;I don&#39;t have anything to give to remind you of me,&quot; Hikaru says 
sadly.

&quot;No problem, I have the photos of two days ago, that is enough,&quot; Umi 
says.

Hikaru looks at the hair band, and finally discovers what she can 
offer to Umi, she grabs her braid and removes her bun, making her hair 
unbraid and puts it on Umi&#39;s hand.

&quot;It&#39;s to remind you of me,&quot; Hikaru says happily.

&quot;Okay, you are so beautiful now,&quot; Umi says and Hikaru blushes.

The two girls embrace each other, under the tree; they embrace each 
other strongly, they know that after this day those embraces will be 
there from time to time, finally Hikaru looks at Umi with a smile.

&quot;Umi, don&#39;t tell me &#39;Farewell&#39;, because inside my heart I know that 
this separation won&#39;t be forever.&quot;

&quot;No, I won&#39;t tell you,&quot; Umi says.

&quot;I love you, Umi,&quot; Hikaru says with tears in her eyes.

&quot;I love you too, Hikaru,&quot; Umi also says with tears.

The two girls kiss each other for the last time; they know that 
tomorrow will be the beginning of a new life, where they&#39;ll face new 
challenges, happiness, sadness, victories, defeats, but they know that 
it will be a test for the love that they feel, it will be six years 
where their feelings will be judged but they want to face that new 
life with the hope of that those six years pass and finally they can 
be together...forever.

------------------------------------------------------------

Japanese Terms:

Aishiteru: I love you
Koishii: Beloved

Well, it&#39;s a little sad but hopeful.

Matta ne!!!!

&quot;A girl that loves a girl, a boy that loves a boy, that is not more 
than the proof that we are humans, and for that reason, we can make 
the unthinkable&quot;
