<pre>(Hikaru)
&quot;It&#39;s...&quot; I stood there long, very long, trying to find the perfect 
word to describe the setting but I think there was nothing in human 
vocabulary to describe the scene. Before us lay a wide beach which 
seemed to have just jumped right out of a picture. The sand was 
almost snow-white and tickled slightly under my now bare feet. The 
beach stretched out in an U-shape like a typical secluded bay and the 
water of the ocean spilled against the shore with sometimes gentle, 
sometimes harsher movements. Above us the sun was shining brightly, 
presenting just the right conditions of clarity and warmth for the 
whole surroundings. All around us palms - yes, palms in Cephiro! - 
were surrounding the bay and concealing it from ground view. Nobody 
was here, except Umi and me.
	&quot;... beautiful,&quot; I finished my statement lamely, feeling, as 
if I had just spoken a dire insult to the area in particular. 
Beautiful did not even begin to describe it. Not by a long shot. 
There were seagulls circling over us and something akin to Earth&#39;s 
dolphins could be seen playing in the distance, their jumps and the 
rays of sun illuminating the water in a sparkling display that could 
clearly take your breath away. And I was sure, I hadn&#39;t even taken in 
everything the beach had to offer so far.
	&quot;You like?&quot; Umi grinned at me and I shook my head to snap out 
of my transfixed state. &quot;Un! This is truly amazing! How come nobody 
knows about this?&quot; I could not help doubting that nobody had found 
this spot so far. It had been four years since the recreation and as 
big as Cephiro was, a spot like this would stand out to any person 
capable flying or taming flying creatures like a candle in a room 
full of darkness. So it was a bit unbelievable that we really were 
the only people on this whole, long beach.
	Umi laughed lightly. &quot;You are spending too much studying. A 
ruler should know his land, especially her best friends&#39; private 
place.&quot; I blinked at that. THIS belonged to Umi? No way! &quot;I have 
created this bay through the force of my will, took a lot of effort 
but it was easy with the vision I had in mind as a template.&quot; I 
didn&#39;t really doubted that she was strong enough to achieve this, our 
hearts were the strongest in the whole of Cephiro and the land albeit 
the Pillar system was technically abolished was still a land where 
the will determined everything. What really was on my mind was the 
question what exactly she did have in mind as a &quot;template&quot;. The wish 
had to be pretty strong for such an outcome and whatever Umi had 
focused on had to be something she treasured deep in her heart.
	Before I could elaborate this thoughts though, a shadow 
passed over us and a winged, blue dragon shot up into the sky. 
Selece, Umi&#39;s Mashin. My friend had surprised me, when she had called 
her Mashin for transport, in his true form. As it seemed, since we 
had proven ourselves several times now and our ties to the Mashin had 
become so deep, it wasn&#39;t necessary anymore to simply don them. 
Distracted by the departure of the ancient creature, I did not notice 
Umi&#39;s movement before it was too late.
	&quot;Hikaru-chan,&quot; she breathed and my head snapped up when I 
noticed how close we were to each other. Not to mention that Umi had 
already discarded her top and was leaning over me now in her tight 
blue-black swimsuit that outlined her form very nicely - to say it 
nicely. My friend had truly matured into a beautiful young woman that 
betrayed her still young years. Everyone who would see her and know 
that she was still no older than eighteen, would guess her in her 
early, middle twenties. I had not come around to notice that with the 
daily close proximity between us. But only now, when she didn&#39;t fair 
fancy, long robes or official armor, the radiating and natural beauty 
came to the surface. Few people saw her like this and if they would, 
I&#39;m sure Umi would have thousands of suitors already. Not that there 
weren&#39;t enough already besides Ascot and maybe or should I say better 
Clef? Umi had never given any indication to be with any of them.
	&quot;Do you know, who I had in mind? Who helped me creating this. 
Do you want to know how I call this place?&quot; Now I was truly curious. 
Had she found someone I didn&#39;t know about? But, I would, wouldn&#39;t I? 
Umi never held any secrets back from me. If there was someone, or if 
she had began to finally bond with Ascot or Clef, she would have told 
me, I would have known. Still, I could feel the strong magic at work 
here, supporting the setting. That was no illusion but a solid place, 
formed and secured by the image of a very strong wish. If it was a 
person Umi did have in mind, when this had to be someone she held 
very dear and had very deep feelings for. I could feel the 
unconditional love floating this place as a prime emotion in its 
foundation.
	&quot;I have named it... Hikaru Bay.&quot; I stood there frozen to the 
spot once again, literally paralyzed this time. This breathtaking 
place, shaped by Umi&#39;s willpower alone, was meant to be... mine? No, 
not mine, shaped from Umi&#39;s feelings for... me... I could feel tears 
glittering in my eyes but didn&#39;t bother to wipe them away. I couldn&#39;t 
really as unable to move as I was. My heart jumped at the thought 
that my friend had devoted this beautiful beach solely to me. Could 
that mean...? Was it possible that...? Thoughts raced through my 
mind, scenes from the last years, Umi&#39;s devotion to me, turning down 
any suitor who wanted to come closer to her. That had always 
disturbed me somewhat and left me feeling that I was the cause for my 
friend&#39;s endured loneliness... Maybe it really was. Do you love me, 
Umi? I asked myself with a quiet, musing smile, surprised at the 
thought. No, not the thought more a surprise at how much it didn&#39;t 
surprise me...
	Umi unbeknownst to me had turned away with a wicked grin on 
her face. &quot;Well, since we are all alone here, we can even bath 
naked!&quot; I stared incredulously at my friend as she began to loosen 
her bikini... &quot;Nani...? Umi-chan!&quot; was the only thing I managed to 
sound somewhat shocked while spluttering. Umi paused halfway and shot 
me a mischievous look. &quot;Hai?&quot; I was not quick enough to avert my eyes 
to the ground, still to wrapped up in the concept of the previous 
discoveries, and caught a good glimpse at very delicious... 
ack! &quot;I... I... don&#39;t think this is such a good idea.&quot; There was a 
silence in which I didn&#39;t dare to look up. &quot;Oh, okay,&quot; my friend 
finally said a bit disappointed though I could not tell, if it was 
mocking or real. She pulled her bikini top back up and smiled 
brightly. &quot;Come on, Hikaru-chan, let&#39;s hit the waves!&quot; With which she 
turned around lightly laughing and took of towards the inviting 
ocean. Damn you, Umi, I thought, reverting to a less used method of 
cursing, I probably have dreams about this for some time.
	Still, despite the open, daring action, I felt my mood was 
even better than before and I realized that most of this had been 
teasing to bring me out of my tight, usual day rhythm. We were on 
vacation and Umi had quite effectively brought me in the right mood. 
Shrugging of the confusing feelings making a mess of my mind, I began 
to race after my friend with a playfully outraged shout of: &quot;Come 
back, you!&quot; Umi just laughed and I soon joined in.

(Umi)
The water splashed against my bare legs, cooling the skin from the 
warm sun above. It was not really hot today, just right for a day on 
the beach. Don&#39;t get me wrong. Since the Pillar was officially 
abolished Cephiro didn&#39;t have so much weather control than before but 
all in all the weather was stable... compared to our world. The waves 
were mostly gentle and as I lowered down to cool the rest of my body, 
I felt the tension from long, exhausting days of work leave me and my 
muscles relaxing.
	I looked back and saw Hikaru from a distance entering the 
water. Her skin was still a little flushed and I felt bad for taking 
her by surprise and teasing her like that. But... The talk with Clef 
in the morning had left me thinking and when I came back and saw 
Hikaru standing there on the balcony, I could not help but jump at 
the chance. I didn&#39;t know, why I was doing that, honestly, I had kept 
quiet all these years. However, seeing - feeling her doubts, maybe, 
just maybe, there was still a possibilities. Thin probably, very, 
very thin. Yet, I could at least say afterwards that I had tried.
	I turned back to the open sea and swam for awhile, 
occasionally diving under the waves. The embrace of the ocean was 
comforting and soothing. I felt in my element here. Water was my 
magic and therefore swimming came as something as second nature to 
me, although I had never done anything even semi-professional. I had 
discovered that a long time ago and whenever I wanted to relax and 
needed some peace, I would go swimming somewhere. That was even 
better than fencing. The cool water against bare skin, the enveloping 
sensation... I was only half-kidding when I suggested we could bath 
naked, because when I was alone, I often did. I felt much more free 
that way.
	A squeak escaped my lips as I was suddenly swim-tackled from 
behind and momentarily pressed under the water&#39;s surface. I emerged 
with a gasp and spitting some choked water to find Hikaru smiling at 
me with a sly smile. &quot;Got you, you little vixen you.&quot; Her tone was 
totally playfully and I knew that I had achieved what was planned 
with my earlier actions. My friend had lighten up considerably and 
was up for a nice day of fun. A prospect I found entirely delighting, 
even if it was just two good friends sharing the fun. I could live 
with that, for now. And during all this, I could show Hikaru what she 
had and would miss. A slow grin crept into my face and settled down 
there.
	&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; I answered and lunged forward. Hikaru squealed and 
jumped away, taking off quickly. I jumped after her and chased her 
swimming through the low sea. We were both laughing, all the weight 
of responsibility being washed away. I think both of us didn&#39;t have 
fun like this in a near eternity. In my opinion Hikaru worked really 
too hard to my liking. She wasn&#39;t the Pillar anymore - even then the 
people still saw her like it. And that my redheaded goddess could 
support the land with her heart alone, we had tested this already. 
But after two days I had to virtually drag her out of the prayer room 
because she was straining herself too much. If I had to voice my 
opinion about this, I&#39;d say that the people&#39;s worshipping and belief 
in her was getting to Hikaru&#39;s little, pretty head. It was time for 
her to let go a bit. That&#39;s why we were here.
	After a few minutes where I let her escape two or three 
times, I finally caught up with my friend. Hikaru didn&#39;t resist when 
I pulled her back on the back of her own bikini. I shivered a little 
bit at the sensation that surged through my body, as hers pressed 
into mine. Tiny sparks began to make their presence known but I 
ignored it, knowing that I had already done enough back then. If I 
acted on my impulses now, I would just end up terribly confusing and 
hurting Hikaru.
	&quot;Gotcha, you can&#39;t escape now,&quot; I said, playfully tweaking 
her. Hikaru giggled and her eyes twinkled with humor and something I 
couldn&#39;t immediately place. &quot;Why would I want to?&quot; That took me by 
surprise and I would have jumped, if it weren&#39;t for our position, 
when she leaned in closer, pressing our bodies even more together. 
The redhead smiled amused at my reaction and her smile deepened to 
one of affection. I was not prepared, as she suddenly turned her head 
a bit more and leaned in to kiss me on the cheek. &quot;Arigato, Umi-chan.&quot;
	And with that she wiggled out of my arms and swam away 
giggling. Leaving me wondering what the heck just happened. I was not 
sure what she was thanking me for, the bay, the relaxing day so far 
or... other things. Frankly I didn&#39;t care because for that smile I 
would jump down in a pit of lava, if it made her happy - without any 
hesitation. I touched my cheek with one hand while my gaze followed 
my friend as she swam a few rounds before she encountered some of the 
dolphin-like creatures and began antiquating. Had she just flirted 
with me?!? It surely looked like it. It was too playful for simple 
gratitude and too mischievous for payback. I told myself that I was 
seeing things, that my friend was just overwhelmed and grateful for 
my gift, however, why was my heart so warm all of a sudden?
	&Agrave; cry of delight brought me back to my senses and I noticed 
Hikaru happily playing with the dolphin creatures and I smiled deeply 
myself. She was truly amazing. Everyone seemed to love her because 
she was so full of love herself. Even the animals couldn&#39;t resist her 
charm, heck, I had seen beasts crumble before her sweet, innocent and 
pleading eyes. You could not help but love her, that&#39;s why I could 
not help but falling in love with her... As much as it hurt sometimes.
	Seeing her like this, the free, untamed spirit, the joyous 
and big heart, brought back affections memories about the past. It 
made me happy to see that she hadn&#39;t completely lost this innocence 
and purity. No, I knew she had never lost it, only buried it much too 
often deep under the responsibilities she weighed upon her shoulders. 
Seeing her laughing, playing with the creatures without a care in the 
world and the creatures openly playing with her, it made my resolve 
even firmer that I would do anything to make her happy. Even if it 
was destroying any chance of personal happiness for me. The only 
thing that made me truly happy, was seeing Hikaru happy.
	&quot;Umi-chan! Are you coming?&quot; the fiery goddess called out to 
me with a wave. She was riding one of the creatures now and obviously 
enjoying herself. I giggled at her attempts to hold on against the 
higher waves out here and decided to join the fun once again. Maybe I 
was selfish, but I had to at least try. Emeraude didn&#39;t have the 
courage to openly declare her love for Soru Zagato and changing the 
system although she had fully understood how necessary it was, how 
cruel it would be to the next Pillar - Hikaru. However, there was no 
true Pillar anymore, the situation was different and there was 
still... Lantis. Yet, I could not deny what was in my heart any 
longer. Clef&#39;s words had stirred more in me when I was ready to admit 
to myself. But a dream was a dream and a true wish could not be 
denied, not in Cephiro. One principle that Hikaru had declared 
herself so often.
	&quot;Hai, I&#39;m coming!&quot; I called out and chased after my friend, 
my one and only, true love...

(Lantis)
The day sure was quiet without Hikaru around. Not that there wasn&#39;t 
enough to do but without Hikaru everything settled down in a somewhat 
dull routine. Further arrangements were made, invitations written for 
the ceremony. A ceremony that might never take place, or at least 
with an unexpected - to the outside world - to it. It was not 
unexpected for me. I had realized the truth long ago actually. Hikaru 
might be able to fool herself but she could not fool me. The reason I 
was so upset in the morning was because I knew, if I let her go on 
this vacation, nothing would ever be the same again when she came 
back. There would be the most dreaded &quot;talk&quot; and I was surely not 
looking forward to it.
	But I wasn&#39;t like Zagato - not that he had had any 
competition. If that truly was, what she wanted, I would let her go, 
I wouldn&#39;t push her into an unsatisfied future because in one thing I 
was similar to my mutual rival. Both of us - and probably a lot of 
people more - would do anything to make Shidou Hikaru happy. Even if 
it meant, to give her up.
	&quot;Lantis?&quot; I flinched inwardly at the light voice resembling 
the sound of tiny bells. I did not have to turn around to know that 
it was Primera who had quietly slipped into my personal 
chamber. &quot;What is it?&quot; I asked, performing the long practiced ability 
to conceal my emotions tightly. It would not be good for the pixie to 
hear what was going on. I think it would pain her too much. She had 
reluctantly let go when I had made my proposal to Hikaru and despite 
her own feelings she did get along rather nicely with the Fire Knight 
these days. I think she was like Umi in this regard, Quietly stepping 
back and accepting the circumstances.
	&quot;Um... Guru Clef wanted to see you about something. There are 
some issues concerning the Autozam treaty he needs to discuss with 
you.&quot; I had expected as much. Cephiro&#39;s Master Mage was troubled this 
days but for other reasons than Hikaru had been the previous days. 
Something was amiss and it concerned Cephiro&#39;s welfare. That&#39;s why we 
were speeding up the arrangements with Eagle&#39;s home country. The 
treaty would offer us a highly supply of FTOs and other mechas, 
together with a handful of battleships. Even if Cephiro was a 
peaceful country, a non-magical defense was good for balance and 
would prepare us for any troubles probably endangering the new 
alliance. Especially in light of the growing connections to Earth. 
You could never know with their torn political unity.
	I nodded simply, realizing that Primera would need a 
confirmation. There was a lasting silence in which I never felt the 
pixie&#39;s presence slip away, hovering uncertainly in the 
air. &quot;Lantis... are you alright?&quot; I nodded again but I began to see 
how futile that was. If anything elfs were good at detecting even the 
best hidden emotions. Primera had never given any indications that 
she pried but that would not mean that she didn&#39;t.
	I heard a buzz of tiny wings and a moment later she had 
zipped past me and faced me now sternly, hands on her tiny hips. &quot;I 
don&#39;t believe you. What&#39;s on your mind? Is it because Hikaru left?&quot; I 
sighed wearily and defeated. As I said you can&#39;t hide anything from a 
pixie, if they didn&#39;t want you to. And this particular one was a 
special kind. &quot;I guess...&quot; Primera watched me closely. &quot;Its not 
particular Hikaru? Its more Umi going with her.&quot; Another sigh, she 
was drawing the truth out again, slowly. &quot;Maybe.&quot; The pixie 
huffed. &quot;Maybe? Yeah, sure. Are you really just going to sit there 
and brood or are you going to fight for her? I didn&#39;t let you off the 
hook for you to give up now, you know?&quot; she snapped irritated.
	I let our another breath and meet her tiny, inquiring eyes. 
Damn, why did she have to be such a smart-ass just now. I really 
wished she would just leave me alone but the chances of that were 
probably microscopic slim. &quot;What&#39;s the use fighting for something you 
already lost,&quot; I answered tired of holding up a front just for 
reputation&#39;s sake. I knew Primera even longer than I did Hikaru and 
there was not really any use in faking emotions.
	Primera looked at me crossly but thoughtful, for once. &quot;You 
really think so? Why did you propose when in the first place?&quot; I 
didn&#39;t have to answer her. She knew all too well why. Because I loved 
her anyway and just searched my chance. Umi had stepped back in the 
belief that Hikaru only had eyes for me and for the longest time I 
thought she did and that she never could or would respond to her 
friend&#39;s feelings. And whenever we saw each other, Umi and I, there 
were this tiny flash in her eyes that told me that I would terrible 
regret hurting Hikaru.
	As if I ever could. Everyone loved Hikaru. I mean, who 
possible couldn&#39;t? The pixie in front of my face was a good example 
that she could bring everyone around in the end. I could only fall in 
love with her, for her purity, her love for everything and everyone, 
just like the last Pillar, Emeraude. Just like my brother had fallen 
for her, for the same reasons. What this it about us and Pillars 
anyway. We loved them but ended up making them both miserable. There 
was no question that Hikaru was still the Pillar to me and mostly 
anyone else. She proved it several times and I think even though 
Mokona accepted Hikaru&#39;s wish and abolished the system, she still 
held the power and the traits of the Pillar. And if she denied 
herself the truth any longer, if we really followed through with this 
charade, where was no telling, if Cephiro wouldn&#39;t be affected by her 
misery. That&#39;s why I knew it would be the best thing, the honorable 
thing to do. For the land, for Umi, for Hikaru... But it did hurt oh 
so much.
	&quot;Fine, if you think you have to brood around here, suit 
yourself,&quot; Primera exclaimed frustrated. &quot;I&#39;ll go in the meantime and 
make sure those girls don&#39;t do anything funny.&quot; With that she raced 
past me towards the door. &quot;Prime-chan,&quot; I called out softly and as 
expected the pixie stopped hovering and waiting. &quot;Let them be.&quot; 
Silence again. I could sense her was struggling, for any response to 
bring me out of this &quot;stupid behavior&quot;. But I&#39;d made my decision. 
Hikaru had to decide for her heart. If she really wanted to be with 
me, well, when I would surely not complain, but if... Well, I would 
regret it, I would &quot;brood around&quot;, in the end I would accept it...
	&quot;I... I&#39;ll tell Clef you&#39;re on your way.&quot; With that the pixie 
slipped out of the door, her voice cracking. I hated to do this, to 
upset her. Primera was kind and very devoted. Maybe if things were 
different, if things would become different... No, it was still too 
early to think along such lines.

(Hikaru)
Alone I sat on a stone staring ahead. The sunset made the ocean a 
beautiful crimson shade. It was the second day of our vacation. Umi 
had gone out for a late swim and relaxing shower afterwards, which 
left me alone for the moment. That was good since I really needed to 
think. I had told myself time and time again that it was ridiculous 
but I had given up the thought somewhere during the day. Umi and I 
were flirting, openly. I was flirting too, with my best friend... who 
had been in love with me for the Kami knows how long. Oh, silly 
thought, from my position, after all I could consider myself a minor 
Megami-sama...
	I mean Umi. Sweet, kind, devoted Umi. In love with ME? Before 
my very eyes and I had never seen it. I had never given a fleeting 
thought in that direction, considering the possibility behind her 
single devotion, a devotion just to me. To my happiness. I felt so 
bad... and amazingly thrilled at the same time. Why was that?
	&quot;Megami-chan?&quot; Oh, what a wondrous freefall. Speak of the 
devil. She hadn&#39;t used this nickname in years since I nearly snapped 
at her the last time. I didn&#39;t like to be entitled Goddess. From her 
lips though, it sound just affectionate, worshipping too but in deep 
endearing kind of way. Too endearing too my liking. I had not seen 
the reason behind it, had not WANTED to see it. Now, with the 
striking realization, I didn&#39;t mind Umi calling me that. From her, it 
made me feel all warm inside.
	I knew she was behind me, standing there uncertainly, sensing 
that something was off. That were would be a change, an irreversible 
change in both of our lives. And quite frankly that didn&#39;t even began 
to describe it. A change could be good or bad. For the better or 
worse. And whatever I chose I would end up with both. I just wanted 
the wind to blow strong and take me somewhere far away. Sure, I could 
sidestep, stall this conversation a little longer, think harder. 
But... &quot;We need to talk.&quot; There, I said it!
	Umi behind me stiffened, it was amazing how I could predict 
AND sense it without seeing her. The beautiful face, framed by long, 
in the light of the setting sun sparkling blue hair. This eyes so 
full of kindness and a deep spirit. The tall, athletic body... I 
always cleared impossible hurdles before but this... This was going 
to be hard, very hard. The problem couldn&#39;t be solved just by 
concentrating on it, like a school test or a political problem. This 
was a matter of the heart. Usually one of my stronger traits but... 
This was not usual. It wasn&#39;t even expected.
	&quot;Hikaru-chan...&quot; Her voice softly, pleading. I held up a hand 
and she ceased her attempt of speech. God, how should I begin this? 
How should I END this? My mind kept traveling back to the quick 
exchange with Lantis shortly before our departure. He had been 
unusually quiet and a bit distant. As if he had known exactly what 
would happen, what discoveries would be made. And he had let me go, 
in spite of maybe losing me. I didn&#39;t want to lose Lantis just yet. 
However, I had to make a decision now. I started this and couldn&#39;t 
chicken out. That wouldn&#39;t be fair to Umi. And it would certainly 
mess up our vacation, a vacation she had planned so nicely.
	&quot;I feel like a complete idiot and I&#39;m sorry for it.&quot; I spoke 
quickly before Umi could voice a protest that had sure been to 
come. &quot;But I guess, no one can really be held responsible for that. I 
did a lot of thinking over these last days, Umi, and I think you have 
a good idea about what.&quot; A pause. Silence. A nod probably. &quot;I was 
innocent back then, na&iuml;ve even, I never saw it and that&#39;s what I&#39;m 
sorry for. I lived on, made friends, best friends in you and Fuu, I 
fell in love with Lantis, eventually. And I never realized the 
obvious thing in front of my eyes. The hurting you endured or the 
cause of it...&quot; In a soft whisper, I added: &quot;Me...&quot;
	&quot;Demo, Hikaru-chan...&quot; Umi tried but I wouldn&#39;t let her. &quot;NO 
BUTS!&quot; I interrupted forcefully and I guess she flinched at my 
unusual tone of voice. &quot;I had always tried to make anyone happy, to 
make you happy, those I held dear. I never wanted to cause anyone 
pain, not even unintentionally. But who&#39;s to blame, if it is not the 
best that I can achieve? Maybe me for not being observant enough, 
maybe even you for keeping quiet all this time, knowing fully well I 
would want you to tell me. Maybe nobody or maybe both of us,&quot; I mused 
with a rather sarcastic layer to it. I didn&#39;t dare to turn and look 
at her, I knew I wouldn&#39;t be able to hold my resolve or making any 
reasonable decision. Reasonable decision... could we even have any of 
those or was it already too late for them? I truly didn&#39;t know.
	I closed my eyes for a moment, thinking, thinking quick. Was 
where even a choice. I had Lantis, I was going to marry Lantis! How 
could I throw that away only because I didn&#39;t want to hurt my best 
friend? We loved each other, truly, deeply. Lantis loved me and I did 
love Lantis... or did I? If you had asked me the question a month 
ago, when the Kairu had made his proposal, I would have laughed at 
the ridiculous question. Sure I did. I still did. But did I love him 
more than... Umi?
	I let the concept pass through my very being, listening 
closely what my heart was telling me. We had met four years ago, 
thrown into a strange world, a friendship shaped and strengthened by 
hardships. As long as I knew her since then, Ryuuzaki Umi had been by 
my side, making sure I&#39;d smile, cheering me up when I was down. Heck, 
she even encouraged me when I had doubts about Lantis before or 
played counselor when I was still deciding between him and Eagle, she 
listened when I needed an understanding ear... Umi had always been 
there, no matter what. When I was sad I could turn around and be 
sure, she was there, welcoming me with a warm embrace. When I was 
happy and enjoying life, I could be sure she would be right by my 
side, sharing the joy with me. And when I thought about all my close 
friends and let my love sort out an order, as hard as it was for a 
person like me, Umi was high up, looming like a supreme goddess over 
them all. No, question there. So... Was there really a choice?

(Clef)
The lasting silence of my chamber usually was a comforting one. There 
was nothing that could interrupt my meditations, no unprepared 
interruptions. In times like this though, then my spirit was troubled 
and I&#39;ve looked forward to an uncertain future, the silence became 
rather unsettling. Up to a point there you rather welcomed a 
distraction.
	&quot;Guru Clef?&quot; It was a testament to my nerves that I slightly 
jumped. There was only a handful of persons in Cephiro who could 
manage to pass my barriers undetected - Hikaru and Lantis among them. 
The latter now stepped quietly beside me and stared out of the top 
window, showing the beautiful evening sky. I could sense the heavy 
burden pressing down on his heart but I could not do much to lessen 
them. It was for the best that I did not address the matter.
	&quot;You called me?&quot; I nodded quietly. Waving with the staff in 
my hand and the window changed, showing a picture of a dark void with 
a brilliant, sparkling pool of light in the middle. Thin lines and 
cords stretched from the light out in all directions, like the net of 
a spider. In the nothingness around the light where normally existed 
nothing else, but if you looked closely you could see the void move, 
edging closer to the light while simultaneously expanding outward, 
eating away on the reality around it.
	Lantis next to me drew in a sharp breath. &quot;It developed that 
far already?&quot; The Kairu did not seem to be pleased and neither was 
I. &quot;Apparently. I was surprised myself. This is a threat we can&#39;t 
ignore. I have sent Primera to get Hikaru and Umi back...&quot; I held up 
a hand to still his protest. &quot;I know, I know, bad timing. But that 
can&#39;t be helped. We must have a full council to discuss this matter 
and we absolutely need all the Magic Knights. If we do not act 
quickly, all the hard work they did for the gateway might be in 
vain.&quot; There were a lot of things that could that I didn&#39;t even want 
to think about but quite frankly we could simply lose our independent 
status when what I feared came to transpire.
	Lantis heaved a weary sigh. &quot;Of course you are right. 
Still... Wouldn&#39;t it be better to know what exactly we are dealing 
with? Sending the girls into a battle, where they don&#39;t even have a 
clue about their enemy... We all know what happened last time.&quot; I 
waved the question away. &quot;Already taken care of. I send the NSX II in 
company of Ascot to test the strength of... it. Unofficially and 
private of course.&quot; Lantis smiled. &quot;Of course. It was all a bit 
easier in the old days, right?&quot;
	That was a theoretical question and he knew it, but I still 
nodded. &quot;Maybe so. But we all decided that this was the best solution 
and after all our say in everything is still strong enough to justify 
such actions. They are for &#39;national security&#39; after all.&quot; The other 
raised an eyebrow at my unusual sense of humor but staid silent.
	After a while he spoke up again. &quot;You said all the Magic 
Knights?&quot; I held up my staff in response and let the image vanish 
before I sharply turned around. &quot;Yes. Unfortunately we still don&#39;t 
have any clue about the Earth elemental. That might not even be 
necessary though. After all we have... her.&quot; I did not see him but 
knew instinctively that Lantis was frowning. &quot;Is this wise?&quot; I sighed 
in response. &quot;No. But I&#39;m sure, I don&#39;t have to explain my reasons. 
We have no other choice in this matter.&quot; Lantis was silent for a 
moment, then I stepped forward towards the door. &quot;I&#39;ll go wake her 
now. Inform the rest of the High Council, as soon as Primera brings 
back the other two, we will have to share this matter at last.&quot;
	Without another word or waiting for a confirmation, I stepped 
out of the chamber. Walking silently through the hallways, I finally 
reached a seemingly dead end on the lowest section. I tapped with my 
staff against one of the sections and the tip began to glow softly. 
The wall slid open, revealing a doorway. Leading into a darkened room.
	Cautiously I stepped into the room and the wall resealed 
behind me. The only thing in the chamber, secured with the strongest 
wards in the whole palace, was a stasis sphere. Inside hovered the 
still form of a young teenage girl, with long pinkish hair and long-
pointed ears...

(Umi)
I could not speak, I could not think, I could not do anything. It was 
just all too much. Hours before we had still enjoyed the nice weather 
and another day on the beach and now... I had know that this 
conversation would come, that she would find out sooner or later. I 
had made it as obvious as possible, without being too forward. But 
the way she talked, the way she would not turn around and face me, 
although I knew exactly why, it pained me. Something glittered in my 
eyes and I didn&#39;t need to reach up to tell they were tears. I felt 
like the very first day I had discovered that I was truly and totally 
in love with the redhead and wondered how long I had to cry that time 
for tomorrow&#39;s light to reach me, to end the night of sorrow. I had 
been miserable all night, couldn&#39;t sleep. I felt like I was betraying 
my best friend by loving her, burdening her with it. I was at my 
limits this day but at the end of the night, my resolve had hardened 
and even though I could and would not want to deny what was in my 
heart. I swore myself that she should never know.
	&quot;Well, you see. I think it&#39;s time to make a decision... No, 
wait a declaration is more like it since the choice had been made a 
long time ago. Only that I was too blind to see that there was a 
choice.&quot; God, that was going to be tough. I braced myself for the 
following lines. Of buts and howevers and I knew what would stand at 
the end.
	&quot;I cannot deny what was there between us especially the last 
two days. I know, I was openly flirting but still denied myself the 
truth that it was more than friendly teasing. I have been with Lantis 
for the smaller part of four years now. During school breaks and now 
for the last few months. And I just realized how stupid I was. I did 
exactly what I never wanted, what I... we wanted to stop from 
repeating. I let the people shove their beliefs upon me. Even though 
I despised it at first, I began to let the worshipping get to me. And 
with it the pressure. The Pillar is allowed to love, so why don&#39;t set 
an example? Her and Count Lantis love each other, perfect! Now they 
just need to marry to signal the start of the new future.&quot;
	I gaped at that, rarely had Hikaru ever talked like that. In 
private a few times, yes, but outside her private chambers... No, 
always sweet, little Hikaru, who everyone loves. I knew how she felt 
over the whole worshipping act but hearing her like that, it was just 
like hearing my own thoughts. The redhead laughed bitterly and shook 
her head. &quot;But that doesn&#39;t matter anyway. I love Lantis you know, I 
truly do, still I wished I wouldn&#39;t have let myself be pushed into 
this marriage. Then he made his proposal, I was overjoyed, yes, but 
that wasn&#39;t really the problem. I never let him know that there was 
something bothering me, I didn&#39;t even know something was bothering 
me! Or better, I didn&#39;t admit it.&quot;
	Hikaru stopped and took a few deep breaths, probably trying 
to calm her nerves since she was beginning to babble. The period 
silence only made me hurt more. I could guess already how this was 
going to end and I was strongly tempted to just plead with her to 
stop, to say, no more, to forget about these two days and that 
everything could be like it had been. Nothing would ever be like it 
had been. Never again. I had known the risks, knew how small and thin 
the chances of success had been. But on a whim, acting on some 
mysterious words from our all wise local sage I had thrown everything 
away. And should I tell you something? I was glad about it. Even with 
all the grief it cost me now and would cost me in the future, I 
didn&#39;t regret finally letting go of the secret that I had kept for 
years. Maybe I should run now... No, I could never run from Hikaru. 
How bitter through may be, I could never run from my love.
	&quot;Demo... I accepted and I will probably stand there in under 
two weeks, in front of the whole representation of status and power 
of both of our worlds. There really is no choices anymore because it 
had been made long ago without me even knowing that I was truly 
making one.&quot; I closed my eyes in defeat. There it was. The moment 
there she would say that she loved me, as a friend, for always and 
ever but that it was Lantis she was going to marry and no one else, 
that she felt terrible sorry and guilty... I don&#39;t know, if I could 
stand it. &quot;Onegai... don&#39;t...&quot; I whispered but was ignored as 
expected. &quot;And you know, I need someone up there with me, someone 
standing beside me, holding that ring and... slipping it onto my 
finger. Do you know who I want that to be?&quot;
	Oh goddess, no! Not that. Not that please! I shook my head 
furiously. She was going to ask me to be her Maid of Honor, Hikaru 
was asking me to stand up there with her and act as a witness then 
she and Lantis pledged their pact for live. I didn&#39;t think I could 
stand it. Not that. Anything but never that. Didn&#39;t she realize what 
she was doing to me...
	Soft fingers under my chin, gently lifting my face and I felt 
myself becoming lost in this fierce sparks of ruby flames. We were so 
close, only inches apart. It would be so easy, was so beckoning... 
Her eyes so full of life, so full of love... love for... &quot;You.&quot; And 
before I knew it, her lips were caressing mine in a soft and gentle 
kiss throwing me headfirst into the ocean. And that is then Hikaru&#39;s 
last words finally registered and the realization hit me with the 
force of a hammer blow. It would have surely knocked me down, if I 
hadn&#39;t felt Hikaru&#39;s arms around my neck, steadying me, drawing me 
deeper into the kiss. Firmly, passionate, almost desperate. I was 
always sure that when you are falling in love its just like blinking 
your eyes and the passion flies by you like the wind. Just now, I 
felt like I was falling in love all over again. With the same person. 
But this time it was the spark of a new beginning. And I looked 
forward to it, to learn how strong I could be, on this new path 
leading to love. My true love, my only love, my no longer unrequited 
love.
	&quot;Shh,&quot; the sweet goddess in front of me whispered and wiped a 
few tears from my face. &quot;Aishiteru, &#39;Mi-chan.&quot; I think she would have 
to clean a lot of tears tonight... Not tears of pain and regret 
anymore but tears of joy. Joy from the happiest girl in the whole two 
worlds.

(Primera)
I could not believe him! Well, okay, maybe I could... a little. But I 
had not wasted four years of my life quietly stepping back for him to 
surrender at the first possibility that maybe something had happened 
between the two girls. I suppose it was no secret to any of the 
Cephirians that there was something, at least from Umi&#39;s side and I 
had found myself openly admiring her strength with which she played 
her role. I did not know, if I was capable to endure such a strain.
	Still, although the atmosphere between us had always been 
admittedly high-charged with emotion, I was a little angry at Lantis. 
Surrendering that quickly was not his style. I was not so blind to 
believe that I had anything to do with it and though I normally would 
have jumped at the chance four years ago, this wasn&#39;t four years ago 
anymore. I still did love Lantis with all my heart, there would never 
be a doubt about that. However, considering the choices and 
sacrifices we made coupled with the still existing race barrier, how 
could I believe that things would change, even if Hikaru threw the 
wedding in favor of her best friend and protector?
	All this things should have made me rather outraged at the 
scene I witnessed, concealed by a a few reeds nearby. Yet, as a 
pixie, we were so tuned to emotions, that they can swing from one 
side to another in a heartbeat. And the scene was so... so... 
romantic! Gee, I had no idea what really happened or lead to this, 
arriving late at the scene as I had, but seeing them embracing and 
kissing with such passion... As hard as it sounds, Lantis would have 
had no chance, not even if Cephiro crumbled around them... I felt a 
warmth engulf me just from being close to them without even extending 
my senses. I didn&#39;t dare to do this for once out of fear of being 
discovered right away and also because the sure intensity would 
surely have sent me in a trauma.
	I inched a little closer to see and hear better when the two 
girls finally parted and sat down next to each other. Hikaru was 
looking down into her lap a bit sheepish and definitely flushed. So 
my guess was right, it was her initiating! Which I found a bit odd, 
thinking that Umi would have searched for her last chance in a 
desperate course of action. Still, this only meant that the matter 
was more than likely settled without question. Again I felt sorry for 
Lantis and a tad bit angry, but I bit down on it and watched 
curiously.
	&quot;You mean it?&quot; I was not sure, if Umi really meant it as a 
question. The tall Water Knight should have guessed the answer from 
the question already. Yet, what I&#39;ve seen from the first seconds she 
seemed to be rather taken by surprise. Hikaru looked up with a faint 
smile which spoke of all the confirmation Umi would need. The blue-
haired girl shook her head a mockingly amused look on her face. &quot;You 
know, you nearly gave me a heart attack with your little speech. I 
was sure, you wanted me to be your Maid of Honr or something!&quot; Made 
of Honor? Oh, so Hikaru had taken the approach over the wedding... 
Weeding! But that would mean...!
	The entitled Pillar laughed softly. &quot;Gomen, &#39;Mi-chan. I 
didn&#39;t know how to say it and I think I only made up my mind during 
the whole talk...&quot; Her friend raised a curious eyebrow and a little 
uncertainty creped into her features. However, the Fire Knight was 
quick to dispose her worries. &quot;Iie, I meant what I said, Umi. I think 
a great part of me still and will always love Lantis. But... If it 
comes down between him and you, I...&quot; She hesitated and looked down, 
her right hand trembling as she removed... The engagement ring! And 
held it out to Umi! What the heck was she...? &quot;I would be more than 
happy, if you marry me.&quot;
	I held my breath and watched as Umi froze for a moment, 
staring at the offered treasure, as if it was about to transform into 
a snake and bite her. Then her eyes softened as she noticed Hikaru 
shaking with nervousness. I think, I began to understand now, what 
she was doing. It was one of the few traditional customs surviving 
Authozam&#39;s technological development. According to Eagle, if 
someone&#39;s love for their love weakened or changed in favor of 
another, it was custom that the person in between made his or her new 
love a present they had received as a gift from their previous lover. 
That way it should ensure that all concerned parties found happiness 
and the one left behind would not be doomed to his love for the rest 
of his life.
	&quot;Of course.&quot; Umi reached out and Hikaru slipped the ring on 
her new fianc&eacute;e&#39;s ring finger. A ripple of magic swept over the 
ring&#39;s surface and the red Escudo gem flashed, turning blue. Umi 
smiled up at Hikaru with a warm smile. &quot;I guess that seals it, hm?&quot; 
The other girl blushed a little but nodded, taking Umi&#39;s hand firmly 
in hers, before she turned her head slightly to the side... in my 
direction!
	&quot;You can come out now, Primera.&quot; I squeaked surprised, not 
expecting to be caught that easily. Sure Hikaru still possessed the 
strongest heart in Cephiro but I thought she would be so wrapped up 
with Umi that she didn&#39;t notice me.

(?)
Nothingness, my one and only constant companion. All around me only 
non-reality of void existed. I was but I didn&#39;t know really who, I 
existed, I even had a name, a purpose maybe... But it was all blurry, 
as if my being was separated and the parts acted on their own, 
gathering information, without the links to put them together into a 
whole. As long as I remembered I was here. Or was it only a few 
months, years maybe...? My mind would not provide the information. 
And so I stayed where I was - no much chance there - waiting, waiting 
for the day where I would be released from... here.
	Suddenly there was a change. The void seemed to give way to 
light and shadows. The parts slowly drifted together and I began to 
understand, began to be really aware. I was pleased somewhat since my 
conscious had gathered information from my surroundings even though 
in stasis and through the barriers surrounding my resting place. It 
seemed a lot had happened and the bits and pieces I had received from 
my mutual counterpart... Oh, how sweet! I looked forward to finally 
meet her. It would surely be fun.
	&quot;Awaken!&quot; The voice bore command and was the only familiar 
one, I had heard before except for my counterpart&#39;s. A shifting of 
ley lines indicated that the stasis field had been gone and I slowly 
opened my eyes, blinking several times to readjust my vision. The 
chamber was dimly-lit and even with my enhanced vision qualities in 
the dark it was hard to make out the small form standing on the 
ground before me. I noticed that I was floating and lowered myself 
slowly down to more or less eye level with the figure. White hair 
with a hint of bluish, long ceremonial robes and a wooden staff twice 
his size.
	&quot;Welcome back.&quot; I smiled slyly at him. &quot;So you finally 
decided to set me free. What has it been four years? Five? I had 
thought you&#39;d let me sleep longer.&quot; Guru Clef did not show any 
emotions but his stance had become slightly stiff. &quot;I had no choice 
in that matter. That does not mean though that you are of the hook.&quot; 
I studied him for awhile, searching for any signs of hidden 
intentions. Maybe that he decided that I was too great of a danger 
after all to simply freeze me away... There were none, which did not 
meant, that there couldn&#39;t be any I was not able to detect. He was 
not called a Master Mage for nothing.
	Walking closer to him, each step like a predator closing in 
on its prey. &quot;So,&quot; I mused seriously. &quot;Why the change of mind? For 
all you know, I could blast you right on the spot and make my way out 
of here.&quot; His expression became grim. He knew that I could pull this 
off. Even still weakened from the stasis sleep I possessed the 
strength of a Magic Knight. Guru Clef might be able to match it but 
could he really hold me?
	The boyish man made a gesture with his staff and a picture 
blinked into existence in the air between us. &quot;This is why.&quot; My eyes 
narrowed as I studied the picture. I recognized it immediately. The 
void of fundament. The center of Cephiro&#39;s magical power and the base 
for the concept of strength of will and heart. &quot;I see you recognize 
what this is. Now see.&quot; The scene changed slightly and I gasped, my 
mood darkening immediately. &quot;What is THAT?&quot; I exclaimed pointing at 
the expanding void and the slowly overshadowing light center. Clef 
was silent for a few moments before answering. &quot;We don&#39;t know. As of 
now, we have no idea what causes it or if the void is really 
expanding or only something that looks like it.&quot;
	With a wave the scene vanished and Guru Clef looked at me 
sternly. &quot;What is important right now though, is that when the nexus 
disappears not only Cephiro&#39;s fundament would crumble but also you 
with it. That is why I believe, you would not want to undergo the 
actions you mentioned.&quot; I shivered at that. He was right of course. I 
was a shadow, a mirror image of someone else&#39;s heart, a creation born 
out of the terror of a moment. For as long as I existed, I had known 
only darkness in my own heart. I had not known what exactly I was or 
why I felt so utterly lost but... I knew I was not really real, not 
like I might wish to be. It was at that time Guru Clef found me and 
locked me away for my own safety, giving me some advice on the way... 
I was not truly sure yet, where exactly I stood towards this world 
but it seemed I had no choice in this matter.
	&quot;I see.&quot; Clef nodded and raised his hand, magic building and 
swirling. &quot;MAHOU DEN SHOU!&quot; Tendrils of shadow and a spiritual light 
wrapped around my form, stirring ancient powers in me. Powers that I 
was born with, that were there from the beginning and longer. A black 
armor with white fittings formed around me. Nothing extraordinary or 
really strong... Escudo armor I supposed. I looked down at myself 
critically. &quot;Nice.&quot;
	Clef turned around. &quot;Follow me. We are going to introduce you 
now.&quot; I perked up at this excited. &quot;Does that mean I&#39;m going to meet 
Hikaru?&quot; The Master Mage shot me a look over the shoulder that was 
between amused and warning. &quot;Yes. But remember what I told you. So 
behave yourself. She has enough emotional trouble as it is.&quot; I was 
puzzled at this for a moment. I had not been able to sort out the 
gathered information from the last days. Emotional distress? Yes, now 
that he mentioned it, I had felt an unease lately... Did that 
mean? &quot;Oh, so my Hikaru has finally given up on this Lantis guy? How 
lovely!&quot; I received a glare at that and a lifted eyebrow. &quot;How did 
you know about...&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;ve been aware of a lot of things around here, twerp boy. 
Or what do you think I had to do while resting? There wasn&#39;t much to 
do,&quot; I interrupted him and gave him a clear look that implied that 
he&#39;d better drop the matter. For his own mind&#39;s sanity.
	The small man grumbled something but unsealed the chamber 
quietly, for the first time fully opening the outside world to me 
again. &quot;I guess so. Come now, we really have to go now... Nova.&quot;

Author&#39;s Notes

Cliffhanger, cliffhanger... Hey, as if you couldn&#39;t have guessed who 
that was, hm?
Well, it&#39;s done. The first chapter complete with sort of prologue. I 
wanted to write a pure MKR fic for some time now and the utter lack 
of any serious to mention fics with Hikaru/Umi. That prompted me even 
more to begin this. Since I&#39;m done for the moment with the V-prelude 
and SiL might take awhile to get back on the way, I have &quot;time&quot; for 
this fic. I will try not to make it too long, for my own sake that is 
but I fear I will - as usual - not succeed.
Well, what is to clear up here? As I said the plot follows the Manga 
storyline (which is only really different in Season 2/Vol.4-6). There 
are several reasons for that. I did see/read both but the Manga 
first. What I did not like in Season 2 was that they changed the 
normal MKR plot that there wasn&#39;t a real enemy, just different people 
with different goals. Debonair was a dumb idea in my opinion because 
it took away the whole idea behind Season 1. Also the end of the 
Manga was more open for interpretation regarding Hikaru/Lantis, the 
Pillar System etc.
Nova. I have to stall until the next chapter. Won&#39;t say anything. :)
Primera is a pixie, not a fairy (as much as my translation of the 
Manga goes).
Did you caught the worked in lyrics of &quot;Yuruzenai Negai&quot; in Hikaru 
and Umi&#39;s scenes during the declaration. I did this a bit on a whim, 
just a spontaneous idea of mine. Did it work well with the emotions 
or not? I&#39;m not really sure.

That&#39;s everything for now. All necessary information how to contact 
me above. I really do appreciate constructive criticism (positive or 
negative), you don&#39;t get a lot of this very often.

Ja ne, yours
