<h1>A Wish TOO Strong?</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rayearth/index.html">Magic Knight Rayearth</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mysticmew.html">MysticMew</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	Nova had lost.
	She knew the moment the master smith - or whatever she was 
because she really didn&#39;t feel like the one from Hikaru&#39;s memories - 
had entered the shared mind. The meddling little human had the 
audacity to interfere with her time with Hikaru. Hikaru was hers and 
hers alone, only with her could she ever defeat the loneliness she 
had always felt within her heart ever since her heart.
	And yet, all that Nova tried had failed. Hikaru had stood 
firm in her belief for her friends, she had, at least somewhat, 
overcome her heart and despite her love for Lantis had managed to 
remember and stand up for her own heart, reviving the Fire Sword.
	And now as she prepared to strike, Nova knew that she had 
lost. However, it would not be in vain. Hikaru&#39;s love for the 
swordsman would be her weakness in the end. She would strike when 
Hikaru least expected it, at a weakness she could not defend herself 
against. It would be perfect and oh so much fitting for all the 
loneliness she had to endure. After Nova was through with Lantis, 
Hikaru would hate her, as it should be. Only then, Debonair-okaasama 
had said, would the pain stop.
	However, suddenly, Nova felt something odd. Something new she 
hadn&#39;t sensed before. Albeit being Hikaru&#39;s shadow she had never seen 
that one feeling before that suddenly began to pulse at the edge of 
their shared mind. And Nova understood. She understood that she 
couldn&#39;t sense it because Hikaru herself was totally oblivious to it. 
And the realization of what exactly it was left Hikaru&#39;s shadow 
stunned for a precious moment until it was almost too late to act on 
it.
	Meanwhile Hikaru was about to end the motion that would 
ultimately cast Nova out of her mind. Sword raised she prepared a 
swift strike of power and magic... and stopped.
	There, instead of the impish girl with the elfin face so 
similar to Hikaru&#39;s and yet so unlike herself, was now a taller, blue-
haired girl staring at her pleadingly and with a look of longing in 
her eyes that startled her. Something deep in her heart 
stirred... &quot;Umi-chan...&quot; she whispered, knowing that it was just 
another illusion, yet unable to perceive it for some reason she was 
at a loss to explain.
	Nova giggled. Perfect. She had thought Lantis was already 
perfect but this... this... This was even better! The plan formed in 
a matter of moments; she allowed Hikaru conscious control and no 
recollection of those last moments. For her it would be as if she 
succeeded in pushing Nova out. But in truth, her shadow would lie 
dormant for awhile and when the time came...

*************************

	Why did she have to say THAT of all things?
	Her emotions were in utter turmoil as Umi exited Ascot&#39;s 
quarter. The joking comment had hit too close to home for her own 
liking. It was true that she had begun to develop feelings for Clef. 
And yes, she was aware of Ascot&#39;s affections. However, try as she 
might the Water Knight could not give what wasn&#39;t there to begin 
with. While she could pretend, Ascot deserved someone who loved him 
back with all their heart. Not just someone who couldn&#39;t even face 
her own feelings for the one person that ranked higher than everyone 
else in her heart. Clef had begun to claim a special place there but 
this one person...
	Umi shook her head angrily. All this talk about relationships 
had stirred the carefully tucked away feelings again that she had 
started to develop for some time now. This had to be taken care of. 
She couldn&#39;t allow herself this confusion now in the midst of this 
crisis. There were so many other things to concentrate on. Finding 
the next Pillar - as disgusting as the idea sounded to her -, 
defending Cephiro against the other countries and then there was that 
mysterious woman and Nova...
	Reaching her quarter, Umi sat down on the bed and closed her 
eyes for a moment, trying to fight down the wave of emotions set free 
by recent events. Caldina&#39;s careless comment had just been the last 
of it and it all came rushing back, try as she might, she could not 
hold it in. All that time spent trying to deny it and it had all been 
proofed futile the moment she escaped from Chizeta&#39;s ship, the moment 
she had heard Hikaru&#39;s mental scream...
	But Hikaru was safe now. She had pulled through, all on her 
own. The sword was revived and with that the ability to don Rayearth 
again. And yet, the fear the usually strong-willed Umi had felt that 
moment, the fear for her friend and the helplessness at being stuck 
fighting those two disgusting creatures of the Chizeta Princesses had 
not vanished from her heart. &quot;Hikaru...&quot; she whispered, a few tears 
escaping through her closed eyelids before she angrily wiped them 
away, clamping down hard on the bubbling pool of emotions, the 
feeling of love for...
	&quot;Hai?&quot; Umi&#39;s head snapped up and she felt her body trembling, 
barely managed to catch herself before falling flat on her back. 
Kami, not now! Why did she have to come now of all times?! Hikaru 
stood in the doorway, staring at Umi in concern but there was 
something that made her stop in her frantic tries to regain 
composure. Something was not right. There was an odd expression in 
her face, a deep, penetrating stare so unlike Hikaru. No, the Hikaru 
she knew was not capable of this. This was a far cry from the 
innocent girl that she cherished so much. A far cry from the sweet, 
genki teenager that would always think of others first, disregarding 
her own health and happiness in the process. Those red eyes were not 
gentle and full of compassion, there was something almost... 
malevolent to them.
	The sound of the door sliding shut startled Umi and made her 
lose the intense stare directed at her fellow Knight. But only for a 
moment it remained on the shut door and the crimson hue enveloping 
its edges when Hikaru put a hand on it. The Water Knight could feel 
the magic and knew instinctively whatever this spell was, it was 
meant to keep her... keep them inside.
	Her eyes swiveled back to the form of her friend, watching 
her transfixed as the Fire Knight slowly walked towards her. &quot;Hikaru? 
What are you doing?&quot; I asked, my voice shaking slightly. There were 
no real obvious signs that something was wrong beside that glimmer in 
her eyes. Still Umi could not help but gulp.
	Hikaru smiled sweetly, however, there was not that much 
sweetness in it. It was more... seductive? Umi&#39;s mind frantically 
tried to sort out what was wrong with her friend. She had not yet 
spoken a word since entering the room, had not answered to her 
question and this intense gaze was always directed at her, never 
leaving her. The Water Knight felt as if she was striped naked by her 
friend&#39;s gaze and the very thought caused a shudder of more than just 
fear.
	Hikaru stopped her... stroll in front of Umi, looking down at 
her with eyes boring right into her her. Umi tried to look away, 
flustered, but could not. The other girls&#39; eyes softened seemingly 
but still something that wasn&#39;t right remained. That smile was 
definitely not Hikaru&#39;s - or so Umi had thought. But now, she wasn&#39;t 
too sure anymore because there was also something hauntingly 
familiar, something that was every bit as much Hikaru as the girl 
standing in front of her. And deep inside of her own heart she felt a 
strong anticipation of what might be coming. And it wasn&#39;t 
necessarily one of fear... That thought made her shiver, feeling 
ashamed of herself.
	&quot;Hikaru, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Umi tried again and jumped slightly 
when Hikaru reached out with one hand to softly caress her cheek. 
Involuntary she closed her eyes, her emotions already so confused and 
close to the surface she could not resist the temptation. Most likely 
she would have sighed in content had the contact not abruptly 
changed, making her eyes snap open again. Hikaru&#39;s hand had cupped 
the flesh of Umi&#39;s face and did so a little roughly, igniting a small 
wince from her.
	&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Umi-chan?&quot; Hikaru spoke in what seemed like an 
almost sultry tone - would it not have been so unbelievable. Her 
words seemed to be mocking Umi&#39;s earlier worried question. &quot;Isn&#39;t 
that what you wanted? Your precious Hikaru all to yourself? Such a 
selfish and yet so strong wish!&quot; Umi unconsciously slid higher on the 
bed, forcing her body to back away from her surely possessed friend. 
A sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu had overcome her and now she was almost
certain 
she knew who was in her friend&#39;s body. Yet, at the same time, the 
words leaving Hikaru&#39;s mouth struck deeper than even the other girl 
might realize right now.
	&quot;Who... Who are you?&quot;
	Hikaru giggled in a way that left almost no room for 
speculation. &quot;I am... Hikaru.&quot; And for some reason, for some 
sickening reason Umi could hear the truth in the statement. Why or 
how she wasn&#39;t quite sure but there was some truth in the claim, as 
strongly as she tried to deny it.
	The Water Knight&#39;s eyes widened when Hikaru reached around to 
slowly, with a seductive wink, pull her skirt down, over her knees, 
letting it fall to the ground, and she could not help but gape, 
seeing as her friend did not wear any undergarment. &quot;Your precious... 
beloved... Hikaru...&quot; Gulping audibly Umi forced her eyes away from 
her friend&#39;s exposed, most private part. Her heart was hammering in 
her chest and she backed further away when the bed shifted, signaling 
extra weight had just entered it.
	&quot;Come on, Umi-chan, you know you want it, don&#39;t you,&quot; Hikaru 
drawled in a voice that definitely was so alien to the one Umi knew 
from her friend. Had this all been her fault? Had her selfish wish 
been so strong that even keeping it buried deep in her heart it had 
done this to Hikaru? The thought made her squeeze her eyes shut with 
unbidden tears of regret and shame. But also there was excitement at 
the thought and some kind of hope. This only made the Water Knight 
even more ashamed of herself though. What kind of freak was she? How 
could she corrupt the feelings between her and her best friend like 
that?
	Umi&#39;s eyes opened almost lazily, trapped and helpless, when 
she felt something leaning over her. She had hit the far headboard 
already, unable to back away any further. Hikaru - or whoever it was -
 had caught up with her, a disturbingly happy expression on her face.
	&quot;Is that not what you want?&quot; Hikaru asked in a hypnotic-like 
tone, the flat of her hand caressing Umi&#39;s cheek. Umi felt herself 
unable to pull away - even if she could have been able to -  when the 
hands that slipped under her armor and uniform. Shuddering under the 
flood of sensation the not so subtle touches ignited, Umi could only 
plead, but her voice would not cooperate.
	&quot;You crave my touch, don&#39;t you? You long for my touch at 
night, don&#39;t you?&quot; And Umi could not deny. Not because she was unable 
to speak, but because it was all true. An unbidden, almost inaudible 
moan escaped her when she felt Hikaru&#39;s hands on the swell of her 
breasts, caressing, massaging, tweaking, pinching lightly... 
squeezing roughly. The Water Knight let go of a small cry and 
followed it up with another when Hikaru in a move of surprising 
strength ripped the layers of clothing clean off her body, exposing 
her body to lustful crimson eyes, gazing down at it.
	&quot;Hikaru-chan...&quot; Umi managed to croak out, tears of guilt and 
shameful arousal mixing. &quot;Please... don&#39;t do this...&quot; Not like that. 
That&#39;s not what she wanted, not what she wished for. Hikaru wasn&#39;t 
herself, she wasn&#39;t even sure who it was that violated her body in 
ways she could not help but surrender to. This wasn&#39;t a conscious 
thing. Despite knowing that the girl was not really her Hikaru, Umi 
could not fight that which was now pulsating so strongly in her 
heart. She felt shame, guilt, even disgust at feeling this way, but a 
part of her still wanted this Hikaru to continue her ministrations.
	A stinging pain shot through Umi&#39;s nerves when Hikaru slapped 
her not all to gently, her remaining hand pinching her erect nipple 
roughly, twisting and pulling. She cried out with a little, pitiful 
wail. Hikaru caught her chin and twisted her head to make her look at 
the Fire Knight&#39;s face. &quot;You desire it so strongly and yet you still 
deny it. How pitiful can you become? I know you want it!&quot; Hikaru 
snapped. Her hands momentarily pulled away from Umi and in one swift 
move she lifted her uniform over her, exposing once again totally 
nude skin. The helpless Water Knight could not avert her eyes despite 
how strongly she tried to. The perfection in front of her too 
tempting. The beautiful curves, the small but shapely breasts. And 
Umi could not protest when Hikaru caught her hand and lifted it 
upwards until it came to rest on the soft, exposed skin on one of her 
breast. A surge of lust shot through her and she squeezed her eyes 
shut again, trying with all her might to suppress the urge spreading 
throughout her whole body. It was no use. Her hand began to move on 
her own accord, slowly but steadily beginning to sinuously massage 
the skin beneath her fingers...
	Opening her eyes, she saw Hikaru smile down at her 
victoriously. &quot;You do love me with all your heart and you cannot deny 
it.&quot; The redhead leaned closer until Umi could feel hot breath 
against her face, eyes were locked on each other, and she felt her 
own breath stopping. The Water Knight knew the other girl was right. 
She could not deny, neither her body, nor her heart, not even her 
mind anymore.
	When Hikaru&#39;s lips met hers, lacking all the sweetness and 
softness she had expected, always dreamed of for so long, she did 
surrender anyway, surrender to the hot, fierce kisses, absent of all 
the innocence that was so adorable about Hikaru. The kisses were like 
flames on her lips, demanding, devouring. Her lips parted on her own 
and she moaned as Hikaru&#39;s tongue forced her way inside, the smaller 
body pressing into her own. Shame was still present but useless 
against the passion and the feelings that she had kept hidden too 
long. The dam had broken and now it was too strong. That wish, that 
dream, that hope that one day Hikaru could be hers, it was too strong 
to overcome...
	Umi was trapped, caught inside the confines of her own wish 
that had developed a mind of its own. For the first time she knew 
what it meant to have a wish that cannot be changed, she realized how 
Zagato must have felt and why he did all this even though he knew 
deep down that many would suffer. Her heart ached for that one person 
and craved for her touch. It screamed at the same time, rebelling 
against the violation she was allowing being done to their strong 
friendship, at the pain inflicted as soon as the real Hikaru would 
realize what had happened and that her friend had caved, had lost to 
her own heart, and ultimately betrayed their trust.
	And still this part of her was not strong enough to make her 
stop, to struggle against it. Hikaru had her mouth buried in her neck 
now, teeth raping at the skin there. Umi jerked when she felt skin 
being torn but a moment afterwards let loose with a sound that 
expressed the powerful surge of passion and surrender at the same 
time as the searing pain, her vision turned white, lights beginning 
to dance in front of her eyes at the incredible, numbing sensation of 
Hikaru&#39;s hand - her whole, tiny HAND - buried in her tight, 
previously untouched cunt. Virgin blood splashed on the bed and the 
piercing sensation of pain was almost too much to bear, only slowly 
overcome by the enormous wave of pleasure, emitting from the first 
orgasm in her young life.
	Eyes wide open with lust but also shock at the forceful 
intrusion and loss of her body&#39;s innocence, Umi forced them upwards 
as Hikaru pulled away from her neck, looking down at her with a tiny, 
triumphant smile.
	And Umi understood.
	Nova for her part was giddy with excitement. This had been 
perfect. That Magic Knight was such easy prey, she didn&#39;t even put up 
much of a fight. Hikaru had tried to push free, obviously feeling 
that something really bad had happened but it was of no use. Nova had 
ensured that she would have control for the time she needed and after 
this was over, she wouldn&#39;t need it anymore. Hikaru would be crushed 
and she would hate her, freeing her of the grief and pain inside her 
own heart. Just like Okaasama always said.
	It was time now. What better moment to pull back when this 
very moment? The Magic Knight Hikaru so cherished as a friend 
writhing beneath her in spasm of violated pleasure and pain - at her 
own very hands! This was really perfect! Nova could have easily 
killed the Knight in her state and probably achieved a similar, 
satisfying response. But leaving her alive and Hikaru aware of what 
happened was much better.
	Umi had not turned her gaze away from her and that look she 
send up at her tormenter was a rather odd one. The blue-haired girl 
reached up with her hands weakly, resting one against her cheek, 
softly caressing it. Tears were dripping from her eyes but Nova could 
not tell whether they were of pain and guilt as should be expected, 
or of something disturbingly different.
	&quot;Gomen nasei... demo...&quot; Nova had begun to loosen her control 
over Hikaru&#39;s mind, letting her catch glimpses. She thought to know 
what the other Knight would say now and it was the perfect 
opportunity. Already she could hear the scream of denial struggling 
to get out from Hikaru and it made her smile in anticipation. 
However, Nova was not prepared for the last words of her victim, 
spoken so softly, one could have doubted they ever left the blue-
haired girl&#39;s lips. &quot;Aishiteru... All of you...&quot;
	Nani? Naniyue? Nova&#39;s shock at the emotion she finally 
realized as understanding, comprehension of who and what exactly Nova 
was, was cut off at the blinding wave of light, burning away at her 
dark nature, washing away her control and leaving her suddenly naked -
 in more than the physical sense - and defenseless. Too late she 
realized that, by attempting to use someone as strongly devoted to 
her other half against Hikaru was a grave mistake...

*************************

	The scenery was surreal. A black void at first it quickly 
began to take shape. There was a ring of flames surrounding a patch 
of ground. One half was completely bathed in white and the other 
completely in pitch blackness. On one side Hikaru stood and on the 
other one could see a translucent form of Nova. But Hikaru stood with 
her back turned, not looking, not seeing that other side. She was 
focused on something totally different and even if she hadn&#39;t been, 
it would have been impossible to acknowledge the darkness&#39; presence.
	Hikaru was in turmoil, her heart and mind unable to cope with 
what was just revealed to her. The image was stuck in her mind. Of 
Umi, her beautiful best friend writhing underneath... herself. No, 
not herself, she tried to deny the fact but strangely enough could 
not. And that was making it ever so much harder, so much more painful.
	And then Umi&#39;s words hit her. Those blue eyes, apologetic, 
begging, longing, full of... desire. Hikaru thought her heart would 
stop, unable to process the feelings the words evoked. Tiny cracks 
began to form on her careful guarded innocence as those feelings she 
had never fully been able to explain, never fully WANTED to explain 
began to push forward, hard and unyielding.
	Umi loved her.
	She had just... raped - the word had trouble forming in her 
mind - her best friend.
	But Umi still said she loved her.
	All of her?
	The thoughts were mingling and confusing. Shame, guilt, 
anger, betrayal, self-loathing and... longing? The darkness of the 
other side began to reach out towards the light but the light 
recoiled, resisting the tempting siren&#39;s call full of dark promises...
	&quot;Don&#39;t you understand... Hikaru.&quot; Hikaru stared, unblinking, 
one arm reaching out towards the figure that had appeared before her 
but drawing back as a wave of shame and worthlessness hit her. Umi 
caught her hand, shushing her protest by placing a finger over her 
lips. The taller girl stepped closer, pulling Hikaru close and 
hugging her. Both of them were naked but neither cared.
	Hikaru didn&#39;t understand. Umi should be hating her, she 
should be disgusted and a part of her whispered to her that Hikaru 
herself should feel betrayed at her friend&#39;s easy surrender to the 
evil being that had made her nest in her heart...
	&quot;Iie,&quot; Umi spoke, as if reading her thoughts. &quot;Can&#39;t you see, 
Hikaru.&quot; Gently she moved in a way that would force the redhead to 
turn around, towards the darkness. &quot;Look,&quot; the Water Knight urged. 
Hikaru screamed inside, thrashing mentally, trying to resist, trying 
to go back to ignoring that which was behind her. She couldn&#39;t face 
her. Why was irrelevant to her, she only knew with absolute certainty 
that she did not WANT to do so.
	And yet Hikaru turned and her eyes locked with... her own? 
Nova stood, shrouded in darkness, not translucent anymore. Her lips 
moved but no sound came out and she looked... helpless? Trapped? 
There was more to it but Hikaru did not want to look deeper, shying 
away from the truth trying to push through.
	&quot;She IS you,&quot; Umi said softly.
	&quot;IIE!&quot; Hikaru screamed and Nova flinched, a look of hurt 
crossing her face. Hikaru was shaking her head violently, trying to 
back away, to turn around and forget, but Umi wouldn&#39;t let her and 
her body didn&#39;t cooperate anyway. &quot;Iie,&quot; she said again, her voice 
dropping to a whisper. &quot;It can&#39;t be true...&quot;
	&quot;Don&#39;t deny yourself,&quot; Umi said gently but insistent and 
Hikaru felt herself, against all of her will, looking at Nova again, 
startled by the hurt and betrayal in those eyes so much like her 
own. &quot;You know it is true. I know how it felt, Hikaru, I know what it 
was like. That one moment.&quot; Images flashed in the center where the 
light and darkness touched, Rayearth, Selece and Windam merged into 
one, rushing forward to meet Emeraude&#39;s own Mashin and impale it with 
their blade. Tears sprang from Hikaru&#39;s eyes but she was unable to 
move or look away, neither could Nova.
	&quot;Disbelief, pain, anger, loathing. You could not believe it 
was true and that nobody ever told us, that Clef never told us. You 
felt betrayed and hated the cruel fate you were pulled into. Just for 
a moment, you hated all those that were responsible for your grief.&quot; 
Hikaru tried to deny but could not speak or find the will in the 
first place. &quot;It is completely normal.&quot;
	Both Hikaru and Nova started at that and the images blinked 
out. &quot;Every human being has light and darkness. We are not perfect, 
nor are we evil. We are only human and that means we are weak at 
times as much as we are strong at others. But you kept all the 
darkness away for so long. There is a time in everyone&#39;s life there 
they must acknowledge and accept that darkness inside of them. I had 
to do so myself and it hurt a lot to control it. But I managed. You, 
however, you had always held yourself so pure that it was impossible 
for you at this point. You were not prepared for it and therefore you 
rejected that part of yourself so strongly that Cephiro created...&quot;
	&quot;A shadow,&quot; Hikaru and Nova whispered at the same time.
	Umi nodded, tightening her grip around Hikaru&#39;s form but her 
eyes were focused on Nova. &quot;I don&#39;t know how you feel about me but I 
know that I love you. ALL of you, do you understand? Love is not 
about cherishing certain aspects, it is about loving the whole 
person, the good and the bad. That is why I could not fight, that is 
why I need... both of you...&quot;
	And Hikaru knew she was right. And somewhere along Umi&#39;s 
revelations the defenses of her heart had began to waver and the 
emotion she had been trying to understand for so long had received a 
name. Being so close to that other part that she had left on Cephiro 
that day, the veil was lifted.
	Love. Hikaru did love Umi. And now she understood why she 
never could realize it. Umi was right. She had been trying so hard to 
be the sweet, selfless, innocent girl that she was unable to realize 
the feeling for what it was that she really felt for her friend 
whenever the blue-haired girl hugged her, was close to her. Her 
innocent mind was unable to process what in her worldview was 
something impure. It was a social prejudices but Hikaru upbringing 
was full of tradition and she would never rebel against what her 
family expected of her. It was silly, really, but for her it was 
unbelievable to have such feelings for another girl. They were wrong, 
they were dark and they soiling their friendship. And so here 
innocent heart blocked them out, making itself completely unaware of 
them. Yet, it had been there, until that moment in the final battle 
with Emeraude. After that the understanding about her feelings had 
been lost to her, gone with the rest that she left behind in Cephiro, 
creating... Nova.
	Slowly, against every impulse, Hikaru reached out towards the 
darkness that began to mingle with her light in the center, wisps of 
red blinking in and out existence as her heart reacted to the failing 
of Hikaru&#39;s barriers. Against her expectations the darkness didn&#39;t 
repel her or tried to swallow her. Instead it parted even though she 
never truly reached it from her position.
	A deep calm began to overcome Hikaru with the realization 
that Umi&#39;s words were the truth. The truth she had been searching for 
so long. And she wasn&#39;t afraid of it anymore. She wasn&#39;t afraid of 
the darkness anymore. Yes, Nova had hurt Umi, hurt her badly and 
Hikaru wanted to hate her for it, truly hate her. But at the same 
time she could not because it would be like hating herself. And if 
her feelings were truly so separated as Umi implied, could she even 
feel hate for herself? And to truly cherish the love she did held in 
her heart for Umi, she needed Nova, because her innocent self alone 
was not capable of it.
	&quot;Come,&quot; Hikaru whispered softly, but her voice was echoing 
throughout the surreal plane.
	And Nova moved forward. She had lost conscious control, long 
ago, ever since being pulled into this surreal reflection of 
Hikaru&#39;s... of THEIR heart. She had not been able to speak or move, 
confined to listen and see all that which was happening. Her mind 
rebelled against it but her heart had long since surrendered. Weak 
and craving for affection, the one person&#39;s affection Debonair told 
her she could never have because the moment Hikaru loved her, Nova 
would only be able to hate her. And that moment had come. But she did 
not hate her other self. She didn&#39;t feel hatred. All she felt was... 
no, not love. Not really, not yet. It was a compassion, a willingness 
to embrace her after all this time, time spent in loneliness and 
rejection. And Nova could not fight back.
	She reached out towards the offered hand, light beginning to 
pierce the darkness, mingling, turning a fiery red where it met, and 
enveloped her, secured her. &quot;Let us try and mend the pain. Let us try 
and let our heart be one again. I need you, as much as you need me. I 
am not good and you are not evil. We choose what we do with our live, 
we choose to what we use the light AND the darkness inside of us.&quot;
	And their hands touched, palm to palm. Crimson light - or 
better twilight - flared and flooded the space inside the ring of 
fire. Nova let herself fall, melting into the embrace of the two 
girls like a little child in its parents&#39; arms. And for a brief 
moment she felt completed. This was where she belonged, ultimately. 
It would be a long way until their heart was ready to be one again. 
However, now Nova knew, that it would eventually be that way.
	&quot;Why?&quot; Nova asked in a tiny voice, her mind still not 
completely coping. &quot;Why don&#39;t you hate me?&quot; After all that she did, 
after twisting the love of the two girls and using it to her 
advantage, blindly following the promises of who she realized now as 
a manipulative woman calling herself her mother. The only mother - if 
the term even applied - she ever had was Hikaru and she hurt her 
harder when any opponent ever managed.
	Hikaru smiled gently, making brief eye contact before 
caressing her smaller reflection&#39;s cheek. &quot;Because I cannot hate 
myself. Because you are a part of me and I don&#39;t want to suppress 
this part any longer. I want to love you because you are me and 
because without you I cannot love the one person I truly do.&quot;
	Umi stifled a gasp at the words but Hikaru had already 
claimed her lips in a kiss that was, in a way, not quite real. It 
felt surreal, just like the whole setting but... it still was the 
sweetest thing she ever felt.
	Hikaru looked at Nova again with an expecting look and her 
shadow understood but hesitated, the images of what she had done just 
a few moments ago - in a relative sense - still too strong in her 
mind. But Hikaru&#39;s gaze never left her and finally she relented.
	Umi had had her eyes closed but now they flew open as she 
felt another pair of lips, different yet familiar, forcing her into a 
hungry kiss the total opposite of Hikaru&#39;s caress. Without actually 
needing to look, she knew it was Nova. Despite her earlier words, it 
surprised - not disturbed but surprised - her that she found herself 
not pulling back. Instead her grip on the smaller girl tightened.
	After finally separating, Nova slowly turned towards Hikaru 
who was smiling approvingly and before she could even react felt 
herself pulled forward by both girls and met her light half&#39;s lips. 
Gentleness and softness met demanding and craving lips as the two 
opposites came together with crushing force. Innocence and passion 
mingled, the pure and the tainted became one. For a single moment, 
they were complete.
	Umi sighed, embracing the two girls fondly.
	The surreal landscape blurred and vanished.

*************************

	The world came rushing back for the three - or two, depending 
on the way you looked at it. Nothing but a single heartbeat had 
passed and Hikaru and Umi were still locked in their passionate 
moment. Umi looked upwards to see Hikaru&#39;s face and the conflicting 
emotions warring in her eyes. She could see the wildness and fright 
as realization of what had just transpired washed over her once 
again, she could see the hesitation despite the unconscious 
understanding that had been there between them a moment ago. Umi 
wasn&#39;t sure if all that really happened or if it was just an illusion 
her mind and heart created to rationalize the feelings that had 
passed between her and Hikaru... and Nova. But Umi wasn&#39;t one to 
question such things in a moment like this, especially ever since 
coming to Cephiro.
	Just as the Water Knight felt her friend stiffen, ceasing the 
movement against her aching center, she reached up to pull Hikaru 
down into a kiss that was both gentle and searing. Both a promise of 
love and a longing of desire.
	And Hikaru surrendered. The whirlpool of emotion settling 
down once again, pushing away thoughts of shame, guilt and anger at 
the violated act Nova had committed. She had committed it. Hikaru had 
accepted that. And Umi still, despite that, loved her, loved all of 
her. The Fire Knight could have sworn she heard her heart weeping, 
silent, soft sobs, and realized that indeed she had heard it. 
Reaching out, she was no longer afraid to embrace the part of her 
that was Nova anymore. They were not yet truly one, this would take 
time, but she would not, could not deny herself now.
	Relenting freely, Hikaru gave way to Nova, leaving control to 
the part of her that knew how to deal with the situation. The wonder 
and awe at this act of trust was warming her heart even further and 
while Nova guided their movements, they still acted as one. And it 
wasn&#39;t an act of cruelty and manipulation anymore for Nova. Now it 
was truly an act of love. And she realized that moment, that it had 
always been that way. From the very moment she made that decision, 
she knew deep down that she could never truly hurt Umi because just 
like Hikaru, just like herself, she loved the other girl too much. 
However, while Hikaru had not known how to react to the call of Umi&#39;s 
heart, the strong wish shining into their split heart, Nova had 
known. The reasons she gave were wrong but the intension had 
subconsciously been the only one possible for her.
	Umi arched her back, moaning into the passionate kiss when 
Hikaru began to move her hand inside of her again. The awful pain at 
the forceful intrusion slowly began to subside as her release drowned 
out the feelings of violation. While technically that had been the 
case, for Umi it was clear, that the part of Hikaru that was Nova did 
not know how to express herself otherwise. It was a dark, twisted 
reaction that an outsider would never quite understand the way Umi 
did.
	Slowly Umi felt herself coming down from the powerful waves 
of her release and opened her eyes, seeing Hikaru impishly smiling at 
her. Before she could even master the ability to speak again, the 
redhead had begun sliding down the length of her body, leaving a 
trail of kisses varying from butterfly quality to hot, burning 
touches all over her skin. Hikaru had pulled out of Umi and was 
caressing the sore flesh of her outer lips, which were still 
throbbing painfully from the earlier intrusion that her virgin cunt 
clearly wasn&#39;t meant to endure.
	Umi was lost in her afterglow and barely managed to grab the 
headboard when Hikaru reached her destination. Placing a single, 
fluttery kiss on the blue curls veiling her center, the subsiding 
flame burst into full glory once again when the redhead&#39;s tongue 
slipped past her nether lips, washing... no, burning away all the 
pain and soreness that still remained there with her touch. Writhing, 
lost in ecstasy Umi had to bite into her cushion before drawing blood 
from her lip. The sensations were too strong, too powerful to contain 
forever though and the blue-haired girl buried her head deep into her 
mattress letting out a piercing shriek. &quot;Hikaru!&quot;
	Hikaru had her mouth firmly locked around Umi&#39;s center. The 
innocent part of her was in wonder at what kind of reactions she was 
able to draw from her friend - or whatever they were now - but that 
innocence, at least for this situation, was more or less just a dim 
echo. Not even Hikaru could deny how good this felt, how much 
pleasure this produced. How much loved she felt, knowing that she was 
making Umi feel like this.
	It was a little startling at first when a flood of juices 
flowed into her waiting mouth but Nova kept assuring her that it was 
pretty normal. For a moment Hikaru wondered how the hell her darker 
half could even KNOW that since as dark as Nova might be, Hikaru knew 
they had no conscious knowledge about sex.
	*Oh. Details.* Nova chuckled in her mind and Hikaru quickly 
choose to not care and rather enjoy. And enjoying she did. Lapping 
all of the cum up, savoring the incredible taste that was her 
gorgeous friend, the redhead pushed herself upwards, surprising Umi 
with the swiftness of her appearance. It was like a moth drawn to the 
flame. Their lips crashed together in fierce need, suppressed 
feelings finally released. The circumstances of all that transpired 
in those few minutes ever since Hikaru/Nova entered Umi&#39;s quarter 
were irrelevant. Their bodies inexperienced as they were, somehow 
knew how to move perfectly against each other. Maybe it was the magic 
of Cephiro, maybe the sheer intensity born out of desperation from 
the ordeal just overcome, maybe it was simply that their love was so 
strong their inexperience did not matter.
	However, as breasts moved against each other, Hikaru&#39;s body 
pressing into Umi&#39;s and Umi&#39;s body meeting the thrust of hips, sex 
against sex, Umi knew one thing with absolute certainty. She dug her 
nails into the soft flesh of Hikaru&#39;s back when her third release 
burst forth in perfect synchrony with the redhead above her. Umi knew 
now that her wish had been granted. And it hadn&#39;t been too strong, in 
a way it had made them only stronger. Hikaru and Nova would need time 
to mend those wounds in their heart but she would be there for them, 
always.

*************************

	Outside in the hallways Fuu and Ferio stood side by side, 
looking out into the darkened sky above Cephiro. Suddenly Fuu started 
and turned her head down the hallway, in the general direction of 
their quarters.
	&quot;Fuu?&quot; Ferio asked curiously, not quite sure what had 
overcome her.
	Fuu glanced back at Ferio, unable to explain what she had 
just felt. &quot;Nothing. I just had the most weird feeling.&quot;

Author&#39;s Notes

Now, that was... strange. I actually had this planned as a bit of a 
harsher lemon story, not really the way, say, Mistletoes turned out 
but... Well, in the end it became more emotional than sexual, the 
actual lemon scenes reduced to just a tiny bit. *shrugs and grins* 
Guess, I can&#39;t complain because I liked how this turned out. :) Who 
am I to complain?
And I did an actual short story in third person and am really pleased 
with it, that&#39;s even more unusual... I wanted to do this from Umi&#39;s 
perspective completely at first but then realized that just wouldn&#39;t 
do it.
I might have written more, at least one more scene, but the cut was 
okay at this point and there is the high possibility for a short 
sequel maybe. Yeah, yeah, me and short. I am continuing Troubled 
Hearts, don&#39;t worry... eventually anyway (gah, too much to do!), 
please be patient.

So, did you like that little piece of fiction? This was produced in 
roughly one day (including sleep, pauses etc.), not too shabby, 
seeing as those short stories (short for me) are a rare thing for me. 
I don&#39;t know exactly where I got the idea. Could be that I was just 
re-watching my MKR DVDs but I hadn&#39;t even been at this point (still 
am not while I wrap this up). I simply looked for a good opportunity 
that could produce a shorter story that I wouldn&#39;t be working on for 
too long since I was in a bit hanging in thin air after finishing the 
fourth episode of TFG. It&#39;s the problem with so many fics running, 
after finishing a part, you have to decide what to do next. And the 
game that I order will at best come in a few days... So, I picked 
this up and it worked out, I guess.
I really hope you liked my approach on the Hikaru/Nova situation and 
turning it into a romance of my fav MKR all at the same time. It 
turned out more R than NC-17 probably but I rather play it save with 
the rating.
Normally I really prefer manga plot, especially of the second season. 
I do not quite dislike Season 2 of the anime, it has its own charm, 
but in my opinion, it lost a little bit of the &quot;no true main enemy&quot; 
rule with the introduction of Debonair who WAS evil. For this setting 
it worked out quite well with the anime.

Feedback, you know me, is always appreciated, welcome and very much 
needed. Thank you in advance.

Ja ne, yours

Matthias
