(Voiceover Hikaru)
About four years have passed since I was elected to be the next 
Pillar by none other than Mokona who turned out to be the creator of 
Cephiro AND our world. *sigh* Anyway. We had returned to our world to 
finish High School and establish some sort of bridge between Cephiro 
and our world. The interaction was coming along nicely so far - much 
against our first assumptions of what the world governments would say 
about the discovery of a world inside our own.
	In Cephiro we have formed a new system more suitable for the 
people and their wishes. They had to lend their own efforts now and 
together we formed a double ruled republic. That&#39;s the best I can 
describe it. The two main instances of power were me and Fuu for that 
matter. Me... Well because I AM the Pillar, even if not really 
technically anymore, by trial I did have the strongest heart in 
Cephiro and the people were a bit reluctant to let go. And Fuu 
because she is the newly crowned Queen since marrying Ferio last 
year, not that any of us would have expected otherwise. Under us was 
the Council of Representation, hosted by elected representatives from 
each region of Cephiro, as well as ambassadors from Autozam, Fahren 
and Chizeta, our neighbors and allies. To make it simple, the new 
world was a much more peaceful and harmonizing world than our own. A 
stability caused by the hard trials Cephiro went through in the past.
	After we finished High School Umi, Fuu, me fully moved to 
Cephiro, while our families stayed at home. An agreement we had made 
for each other and our families a long time ago. Our ties were so 
deeply rooted in that land that it became more a home to us when the 
world we had been living in constantly for fourteen years but it was 
hard for our parents or siblings to live a world where they were 
already established in the society. The new Cephiro was our creation, 
a creation of our united hearts and we wanted to make sure it stayed 
this way. Even if it meant taking huge responsibilities.
	One of this responsibilities was the official crowning of 
the &quot;new Pillar&quot;, me, four years after her election. Technically I 
was already established by the system and Mokona but as most humans, 
even Cephirans craved for a ceremony. And to mark the beginning of a 
new area and the change of the system, I was going to marry Count 
Lantis. A proof that the tragedy that had befallen Emeraude and 
Zagoto would not be repeated.
	So, we thought anyway, but everything came different than we 
could have ever thought.

&lt;Pillar Year 5008, Year 4 since the founding of the new Cephiro&gt;
&quot;Come in, Umi.&quot;
	The huge double doors swung open and a blue-haired girl on 
the verge to adulthood stepped into the dimly-lit chamber. The girl 
stood there for a while adjusting to the strong magical atmosphere 
that was radiated in the chambers of Guru Clef, Master Mage of 
Cephiro. Ryuuzaki Umi, Water Knight and entrusted Counselor and 
Captain of the Pillar&#39;s guard stepped forward. She did not really 
know why she had come here. Her face was troubled betraying the 
girl&#39;s status in her long blue robe. No, that was not really true, 
Umi knew what had brought her here but she didn&#39;t know why, not 
really anyway.
	Cephiro&#39;s oldest living inhabitant - and frankly the youngest-
looking - turned around from his studies and greeted the young Magic 
Knight with a warm smile but his features remained serious. &quot;Does 
something trouble you?&quot; Umi laughed and it was a bit bitter. &quot;Then 
does something not trouble me?&quot; There was no use in trying to hide 
the troubles of her heart from the wise man, even if the implications 
pained him. Clef nonetheless was taken a bit aback by the sharp and 
bitter tone Umi&#39;s voice had taken. Ever since the wedding of Hikaru 
and Lantis had been announced she had been this way and Clef knew all 
too well why.
	Umi sighed and relaxed her posture. &quot;Gomen nasei, Clef. I 
didn&#39;t mean to snap at you.&quot; Clef shook his hand and waved his staff 
in a nonchalant gesture. &quot;Nonsense. I do not blame you. After all 
I&#39;m... already familiar with such situations.&quot; Both were silent for a 
moment, when they thought back to the first time the Magic Knights 
were summoned and for what purpose. &quot;All the more reason for me to be 
sorry bringing such a situation again. At least it will be over in 
two weeks and nobody will ever know.&quot;
	&quot;And yet you will remain in love,&quot; Clef stated humorless and 
a solemn expression on his face. Umi shrugged. &quot;Unrequited and... not 
with you, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Cephiro&#39;s Master Mage whacked her on the head 
with his staff. &quot;Stop that. What is in your heart, you cannot 
abandon. That you are willing to stay with your beloved no matter 
what is a strength for itself. Love, even if unrequited, means to do 
everything to ensure the other&#39;s happiness.&quot;
	&quot;As with you and Presea?&quot; Umi asked with an arched eyebrow 
and slow smile on her face. Clef fidgeted with his robe. &quot;Well... 
maybe...&quot; The Water Knight kneeled down and embraced the smaller 
elder softly, much to his surprise and a bit annoyance. &quot;Arigato for 
cheering me up.&quot; Clef smiled at her. &quot;No problem.&quot; As Umi moved to 
leave the room, the Guru called out to her again. &quot;Oh, and Umi...&quot; 
She turned her head slightly. &quot;Hai?&quot; His expression was once again 
serious and his tone of voice had something lecturing to it. &quot;Do what 
makes her happy.&quot; The girl&#39;s body tensed for a moment as she closed 
her eyes, fighting against the familiar sensation of 
temptations. &quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;
	With that she left the chamber and the door closed behind 
her. Guru Clef heaved a sigh. &quot;I&#39;m getting to old for this.&quot; A 
soft &quot;Puu&quot; came from one corner of the room, from which a white-
pinkish, rabbit-like creature bounced forward, a somewhat sad 
expression on its cute face. &quot;Puu? Puu, puu, puu. Puu?&quot; Clef nodded 
at Mokona. &quot;Yeah, hopefully they&#39;ll come through in the end. If 
not...&quot; He looked thoughtfully out of the window, his face 
darkening. &quot;... we&#39;ll just have a repeat of last time.&quot;

Dawn approached quickly and the new morning came over Neo Cephiro. 
High up in the royal castle, a lone figure stood on a wide balcony. 
Red hair descended freely down her back, the familiar pigtail undid, 
her long and glamorous robe blowing slightly in the morning wind. 
Before her the land that she had so strongly helped to create. The 
long green areas, the serene or wild lakes and rivers, the ocean in 
the distance, the mountain and volcano stretching to touch the sky, 
the islands up in this beautiful blue sky, even the Forest of Silence 
which hadn&#39;t been completely cleared of its natural monster source 
and the no-magic rule. All this the regal appearing but yet so young 
girl at age and experience held dear. She, who was many things. Fire 
Knight, Knight Commander of the Magic Knights of Cephiro, her friends 
called her Hikaru, Shidou Hikaru. The people, the people called her 
simply the Pillar. The system was by her own wish repealed, yet the 
people looked up to her, practically worshipped her, because she 
loved them. For them, she still was THE Pillar. In their hearts they 
would always believe in her, because she had saved them and created a 
new, a better world. Still yet, Shidou Hikaru, the Magic Knight of 
Fire, the acknowledged Pillar of Cephiro was troubled.
	Hikaru looked down at her hand and the ring glittering there 
in the rising sunlight. Lantis&#39; engagement ring. She smiled softly 
for a moment before she sighed and leaned forward to position her 
elbows on the parapet. Two weeks, she mused. Two weeks and I&#39;m 
getting married. The wind pulled softly on her hair. Married. A 
concept she should in all regards cherish and happily looking forward 
to. She was marrying the man she loved, Zagato&#39;s brother, the Kairu 
that she had fallen for during their second stay in Cephiro, the stay 
that had changed everything. A tear escaped Hikaru&#39;s eye before she 
could notice and blink it away. When why does my heart ache at the 
thought?
	Hikaru had not slept well in a long time and her thoughts 
were more troubled the closer the appointed date came. Did she have 
second thoughts about loving Lantis? No, certainly not, Hikaru had 
made up her heart a long time ago. The tall handsome man had captured 
her heart and made it all the more worth to fight for the further 
existence of Cephiro. There was no doubt about her feelings for 
Lantis and she would more than love to take him as her husband - as 
much as it did agitate poor Primera. When why? Why did she feel, as 
if she was making the wrong decision, as if she would make someone 
terrible sad? Someone she cared for deeply... maybe more than Lantis? 
There was Eagle, yes, but as much as she cared for the Autozam 
Commander, Hikaru had long since decided that in the end Lantis had 
won the race for her heart. If it was Eagle, the young Pillar would 
have never accepted Lantis&#39; proposal in the first place. &quot;I&#39;m 
confused. I cannot think clearly so near to him.&quot;
	A pair of slender arms encircled Hikaru from behind and drew 
her into a soft and comforting embrace. The smaller girl closed her 
eyes and sighed, cherishing the feeling of warmth caressing her 
heart. &quot;Hikaru-chan...&quot; Hikaru was probably the only the one in both 
worlds earning the suffix, Umi never called anyone with -san or -kun 
or -chan for that matter. Okay, they had called Emeraude, Emeraude-
hime but that was only proper, even for Umi. The Pillar&#39;s friend was 
always so kind around her, even more in the last years and since she 
became the official guardian of the most important person in Cephiro. 
Hikaru had always wondered why Umi had gone to such great lengths to 
get this position, always staying at her side, in good and ill times -
 not that there were many of the latter. Umi had supported all the 
way of establishing the new system and all of her decisions. The Fire 
Knight truly wondered with what she had earned such deep kindness and 
devotion from the taller girl.
	&quot;Then leave.&quot; Hikaru blinked, brought out of her thoughts and 
a little surprised at the boldness and strength of her friend&#39;s 
voice. &quot;You still have two weeks and you are long overdue for a 
vacation.&quot; Hikaru turned around, her back now against the parapet, 
staring up into her sapphire blue eyes, every protest she had formed 
dying from her lips. Umi rarely looked stern in these days with her, 
now though there was a deep concern for her friend&#39;s welfare. It was 
true too, it was a long, long time since she had truly relaxed. 
School had taken a lot out of her, focusing on politics and other 
qualities necessary for fitting the role of the mutual Pillar, beside 
this she upheld and deepened her Kendo studies to keep in shape. 
Along all this, during the longer school breaks she, Umi and Fuu 
always went to Cephiro to work actively on the long and slow built of 
the new system, as well as the connections to their own world. In all 
this time she did have only a few days of relaxing at best.
	&quot;Well...&quot; she began at last, not yet ready to give in. There 
was so much still left to do, to organize and plan for. There were 
delegations from all the major countries in their world coming, 
speeches had to be prepared, arrangement to be made... &quot;How do you 
expect to make the right decision like this, Hikaru-chan? If there is 
even the slightest doubt in your heart, then make sure it is gone 
before the wedding or... that you have at least figured out its 
meaning. That you can&#39;t do when you load yourself full of work.&quot; 
Again she was right and Hikaru knew, so reluctantly she nodded. &quot;Un, 
you&#39;re right, Umi-chan. I&#39;m taking too much responsible. Just like 
Emeraude-hime.&quot;
	Both girls were silent for a moment before Hikaru reached out 
with one hand to grasp one of her friend&#39;s. &quot;Will you come with me. 
Just us two? I&#39;m sure Fuu-chan and Ferio can manage for awhile.&quot; Umi 
looked down at their joined hands for a long time and there, that was 
then Hikaru saw a flash of... something in her eyes. Something that 
deeply troubled the Fire Knight. It was over quickly and Umi smiled 
at her, nodding. &quot;Of course. Can&#39;t leave you alone, right? It has 
been a long time since we had fun together.&quot; As if suddenly bitten 
Umi hastily turned around and made her way back inside, her cloak 
flapping violently. &quot;Well, see you in a bit then. We&#39;ll let the 
others know.&quot; With that she vanished inside, her eyes for a moment 
visible although Umi did her level best to hide them.
	A sudden feeling of sadness washed through Hikaru at the loss 
of contact and the comforting warmth of Umi&#39;s embrace. All at once a 
few things became clearer. Hikaru&#39;s worries always intensified then 
she thought about her fellow knights happiness. With Fuu she didn&#39;t 
have to worry but Umi never allowed herself personal happiness, no 
cherished moments, neither with Ascot or Clef. She seemed to be 
solely devoted to her and being in her presence seemed to make her 
happy. But... Was that longing in her eyes? Longing for whom? And why 
now? In such a situation? And why, why did her troubled heart matched 
the feeling when she saw the expression in her eyes just now. Hikaru 
didn&#39;t know but she intended to find out. At least a week of vacation 
with Umi should be enough. She would find out, the Pillar would find 
the answers to the troubles in her heart.

The palace was a busy place usually but today started somewhat slow. 
The inhabitants slept in longer than usual and the usual day routine 
just began as Queen Fuu and King Ferio emerged from their bedchamber, 
both of them also having &quot;slept&quot; in. They were not surprised to meet 
Guru Clef already up with Mokona in tow, the spiritual father of the 
land was always up with the rise of the sun. The royal pair were 
surprised though, when Hikaru and Umi came around a corner, clad in 
simple clothes and not the usual robes of business or their armor.
	&quot;Ohayoo, Hikaru-san, Umi-san. You are up early,&quot; Fuu greeted 
and mustered the two girls for a long moment. Ferio, not as reserved 
as his wife, quipped at them: &quot;You know, I really want to see the 
faces of some of the representatives when they see you like this.&quot; 
Fuu gave him a light shove with her elbow and the green-haired 
swordsman winced slightly. Hikaru giggled but got serious again 
quickly. &quot;Actually, we will be absent today and the next days.&quot; Fuu 
wrinkled her brow in confusion. &quot;Why?&quot; Umi coughed at the unusual 
shortcoming of understanding from their friends. &quot;She needs a little 
time off, Fuu. You know that and I insist on it.&quot;
	There was silence for a few moments while Fuu looked 
thoughtfully, then her face brightened. &quot;I guess, that is alright. 
After all you have a wedding in two weeks and you need to be in good 
shape for it...&quot; Before Fuu could continue or ask the obvious 
questions, Hikaru cut in again. &quot;That&#39;s the other thing, I&#39;m feeling 
a bit troubled over... the wedding lately and I really need time to 
think and sort things out. I already talked to Lantis and he agreed.&quot; 
Reluctantly, Hikaru added in her mind. To be true he was rather 
unresponsive this morning, when the Fire Knight had informed her 
fianc&eacute; about her decision. Hikaru felt a little bad about leaving
him 
but her decision was made, she had to find out what was going on with 
her. With a side glance at Umi she corrected, what was going on with 
them. Lantis less them thrilled behavior was not really troubling 
since he seemed to actually favor the idea for her to get a little 
vacation from her duties. Still, Hikaru could have sworn, as if there 
was something like silent surrender in his voice when he agreed. Did 
he know something, she didn&#39;t?
	&quot;Okay, if Lantis is okay with that, I guess we can&#39;t say 
anything about it, right anata?&quot; Ferio asked Fuu who nodded slowly. 
Hikaru frowned at her friend. Fuu was not exactly a morning person, 
but this solemn mood was a little odd. &quot;Arigato,&quot; said Umi for her 
and pulled on her. &quot;We don&#39;t really know where we will be going but 
we call you.&quot; With that she pulled the Fire Knight after her and down 
the corridor.
	Ferio looked at Fuu worried. &quot;You okay?&quot; Fuu nodded slowly 
but her features betrayed the gesture somewhat. &quot;Is it right to push 
them?&quot; The previous days the royal pair had some talks with Clef. 
Cephiro&#39;s Guru had told them about some foreboding dreams he had and 
his thoughts on the subject of Hikaru and Lantis, as well as Umi in 
this picture. Fuu had not been particular pleased but saw the reason 
behind his observations. &quot;We are not pushing, just nudging a little,&quot; 
Ferio grinned at her but even he seemed to be a little unsure. &quot;You 
know that there always was something, didn&#39;t you?&quot;
	Of course, she did. Fuu knew the other two knights ever since 
they had been summoned to Cephiro the first time. They had been 
together almost constantly since then. If anyone could state, they 
knew Hikaru and Umi and the relationship between them, Fuu would be 
on the very top of the list. Out loud, she said: &quot;I guess so...&quot;
	Ferio frowned but didn&#39;t say anything. 

(Voiceover Hikaru)
That&#39;s there our story actually begins...

Opening Scene (theme Yuzurenai Negai)

Tomaranai mirai wo mezashite
Yuzurenai negai wo dakishimete

(We see Hikaru standing beside a river and Lantis on the other side, 
a bridge is forming between them Umi and Primera are approaching. 
Instead of walking towards each other they wait for the other two to 
come, Umi embracing Hikaru lovingly from behind while Primera was 
perched on Lantis&#39;s shoulders. Between them a shot of Fuu and Ferio 
in matching royal gowns with crystal crowns appear. The 
three &quot;couples&quot; turn around to face the screen and behind them the 
MKR logo appears.)

Umi no iro akaku somatte-yuku

(We see Hikaru casting a fire spell illuminated by a white-red aura, 
we see Umi casting a water spell mingling with Hikaru&#39;s. Fuu joins 
the pair and casts a strong wind spell around their combined magic.)

Mujuuryokujoutai

(Mokona floats into the scene above the three, Hikaru and Umi&#39;s hands 
joined in front of them and Fuu with an arm around both of their 
shoulders, Ferio behind them with a hand on Fuu&#39;s right shoulder.)

Kono mama kaze ni sarawaretai

(We see Lantis with a taller version of Primera in his arms, Eagle 
behind them, to their right Clef appears with Presea who has her hand 
atop his staff. Smiling softly. Between them Lafarga and Caldina 
become visible, Mokona floats into the scene once again.)

Itsumo tobenai HAADORU wo
Makenai kimochi de
KURIA shitekita kedo

(Mokona dashes out of the picture, filling up the screen momentarily. 
The scene shifts to a beautiful view over Cephiro&#39;s surface from up 
in the sky. A blue dragon shoots through the picture, two people on 
its back. A four-winged bird rises beside the dragon with a lone 
figure on its back. The camera zooms closer on the figures, revealing 
Umi on the back of the dragon, a happily laughing Hikaru behind her, 
after them Fuu can be seen riding the bird.)

Dashikirenai jitsuryoku wa...dare no sei?

(The dragon and bird glide down towards the ground where a beautiful 
fire lion with a horn can be seen running beneath and between them. 
Hikaru jumps down and the three Knights retrieve their Mashin armor. 
There&#39;s a flash of light...)

Tomaranai mirai wo mezashite
Yuzurenai negai wo dakishimete

(Rapidly scene change. The Mashin in their Mecha form rise to the sky 
once again, straight towards a thick wall of blackness... A dark 
shadow, the outlines of a woman, can be seen looming over the three 
Mashin and the whole of Cephiro. Switch to the knights on a ground 
facing of a horde of monsters, purple flames erupt from which a 
smiling Nova ascends, a golden light overlays here image in which the 
outlines of another girl with long hair can be seen. Switch to a 
picture of the palace, a phoenix racing past it, closely followed by 
the lion, dragon and bird, close up on the Magic Knights in front of 
the entrance, they have their three swords raised, Umi to Hikaru&#39;s 
left touching her rapier diagonal to Hikaru&#39;s sword, the same with 
Fuu on Hikaru&#39;s left. Hikaru swings hers forward and draws a 
pentagram in the air.)

Iro asenai kokoro no chizu...hikaru ni kazaso!
(In the pentagram shots of the NSX (top right corner), the Fahren 
Dragon (top left corner), the Chizeta Fortress (right bottom), and a 
yet unknown ship (left bottom) can be seen. In the middle bottom the 
Neo Cephiro group can be seen, including Lantis, Eagle, Primera, 
Clef, Presea, Caldina, Lafarga, Ascot, Aska, Sanyun, Tarta and 
Tatra), the inner outline of the star is filled with the outlines of 
Cephiro as well as shots of the other countries in the background of 
the &quot;corners&quot;. On the end of the star tips the outlines of the Magic 
Knights can be seen, as well as two other figures on the bottom two. 
One can be clearly recognized as Nova the other is unknown yet. The 
pentagram zooms in quickly and shows the Magic Knights standing side 
by side, their Mashin behind them. Their armor is a little different 
and Umi&#39;s sword resembles more an actual rapier now, while Fuu holds 
up an Escudo longbow, Hikaru&#39;s sword has a second, slightly bend 
blade coming out of the first one. Below them are Nova in a black and 
white Magic Knight armor with two pulsating blades in black and 
white, and the other girl in a golden-brown armor with a long staff 
which ends in an impressive battleaxe. She has long brown-black hair 
and purple eyes. A beautiful phoenix rises over the group and the 
picture is frozen.)</pre>
