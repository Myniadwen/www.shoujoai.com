Four years after the official election of the new Pillar, myself, 
everything had been more or less set for the crowning ceremony and my 
wedding to Lantis, which would mark the beginning of a new era. Yet, 
everything came different as we expected. During a time of hesitation 
and doubt, my best friend Umi took me on a small vacation and 
revealed her own feelings for me. I was shocked, that&#39;s for sure, but 
I was also forced to make a decision. And a decision I made. As it 
stands the wedding will have a slight change to it, now we just have 
to tell our friends and the rest of Cephiro...
	Meanwhile Clef and Lantis are confronted with a threat to our 
very existence which could make our romantic troubles insignificant. 
Guru Clef risked a lot when he decided to release the unpredictable 
renegade known as Nova.

Opening Scene (theme Yuzurenai Negai)

Tomaranai mirai wo mezashite
Yuzurenai negai wo dakishimete

(We see Hikaru standing beside a river and Lantis on the other side, 
a bridge is forming between them Umi and Primera are approaching. 
Instead of walking towards each other they wait for the other two to 
come, Umi embracing Hikaru lovingly from behind while Primera was 
perched on Lantis&#39;s shoulders. Between them a shot of Fuu and Ferio 
in matching royal gowns with crystal crowns appear. The 
three &quot;couples&quot; turn around to face the screen and behind them the 
MKR logo appears.)

Umi no iro akaku somatte-yuku

(We see Hikaru casting a fire spell illuminated by a white-red aura, 
we see Umi casting a water spell mingling with Hikaru&#39;s. Fuu joins 
the pair and casts a strong wind spell around their combined magic.)

Mujuuryokujoutai

(Mokona floats into the scene above the three, Hikaru and Umi&#39;s hands 
joined in front of them and Fuu with an arm around both of their 
shoulders, Ferio behind them with a hand on Fuu&#39;s right shoulder.)

Kono mama kaze ni sarawaretai

(We see Lantis with a taller version of Primera in his arms, Eagle 
behind them, to their right Clef appears with Presea who has her hand 
atop his staff. Smiling softly. Between them Lafarga and Caldina 
become visible, Mokona floats into the scene once again.)

Itsumo tobenai HAADORU wo
Makenai kimochi de
KURIA shitekita kedo

(Mokona dashes out of the picture, filling up the screen momentarily. 
The scene shifts to a beautiful view over Cephiro&#39;s surface from up 
in the sky. A blue dragon shoots through the picture, two people on 
its back. A four-winged bird rises beside the dragon with a lone 
figure on its back. The camera zooms closer on the figures, revealing 
Umi on the back of the dragon, a happily laughing Hikaru behind her, 
after them Fuu can be seen riding the bird.)

Dashikirenai jitsuryoku wa...dare no sei?

(The dragon and bird glide down towards the ground where a beautiful 
fire lion with a horn can be seen running beneath and between them. 
Hikaru jumps down and the three Knights retrieve their Mashin armor. 
There&#39;s a flash of light...)

Tomaranai mirai wo mezashite
Yuzurenai negai wo dakishimete

(Rapidly scene change. The Mashin in their Mecha form rise to the sky 
once again, straight towards a thick wall of blackness... A dark 
shadow, the outlines of a woman, can be seen looming over the three 
Mashin and the whole of Cephiro. Switch to the knights on a ground 
facing of a horde of monsters, purple flames erupt from which a 
smiling Nova ascends, a golden light overlays here image in which the 
outlines of another girl with long hair can be seen. Switch to a 
picture of the palace, a phoenix racing past it, closely followed by 
the lion, dragon and bird, close up on the Magic Knights in front of 
the entrance, they have their three swords raised, Umi to Hikaru&#39;s 
left touching her rapier diagonal to Hikaru&#39;s sword, the same with 
Fuu on Hikaru&#39;s left. Hikaru swings hers forward and draws a 
pentagram in the air.)

Iro asenai kokoro no chizu...hikaru ni kazaso!
(In the pentagram shots of the NSX (top right corner), the Fahren 
Dragon (top left corner), the Chizeta Fortress (right bottom), and a 
yet unknown ship (left bottom) can be seen. In the middle bottom the 
Neo Cephiro group can be seen, including Lantis, Eagle, Primera, 
Clef, Presea, Caldina, Lafarga, Ascot, Aska, Sanyun, Tarta and 
Tatra), the inner outline of the star is filled with the outlines of 
Cephiro as well as shots of the other countries in the background of 
the &quot;corners&quot;. On the end of the star tips the outlines of the Magic 
Knights can be seen, as well as two other figures on the bottom two. 
One can be clearly recognized as Nova the other is unknown yet. The 
pentagram zooms in quickly and shows the Magic Knights standing side 
by side, their Mashin behind them. Their armor is a little different 
and Umi&#39;s sword resembles more an actual rapier now, while Fuu holds 
up an Escudo longbow, Hikaru&#39;s sword has a second, slightly bend 
blade coming out of the first one. Below them are Nova in a black and 
white Magic Knight armor with two pulsating blades in black and 
white, and the other girl in a golden-brown armor with a long staff 
which ends in an impressive battleaxe. She has long brown-black hair 
and purple eyes. A beautiful phoenix rises over the group and the 
picture is frozen.)

Troubled Hearts

Story concept based on the works of CLAMP

Chapter 2: Heartbreaks

&lt;Pillar Year 5008, Year 4 since the founding of the new Cephiro 
(Eagle)&gt;
Blackness as deep as infinity was the only comparable description of 
the void filling the front screens of the NSX II. A deep, pulsating 
see of all-consuming nothingness that was the mantle of Cephiro&#39;s 
very mana nexus. In the center of the void was the nexus itself. The 
pool of brilliant white radiance, the center of all the little minor 
nexi that made Cephiro what it was. Tiny lines could be seen in the 
void, extending from the pool and connecting this world with its 
power. Without the magical center that was also known as the Spring 
of Fundament, magic would be a concept as foreign to us as it was to 
the other worlds and Cephiro&#39;s outer mantle. Earth.
	&quot;Status.&quot; I ordered, observing the scene with a frown. The 
void was steadily expanding. Not very fast but apparently without 
indication of stopping anytime soon. The web of ley lines was still 
existing but a lot of its parts were already darkening, not to 
mention that the center itself was slowly being overshadowed. As it 
stood there still would be months until the last bit was consumed, 
yet that alone was frightening enough.
	&quot;Substance analysis brought no results. Growth of the void at 
unstable 0,467 percent per hour. I cannot say for sure how long the 
center will hold at this rate, because the expansion rate is varying 
every few minutes,&quot; Zazu reported, staring intently at his console, 
as if it would jump him any seconds. The rest of the bridge was no 
better and even I had to say I felt a certain uneasiness at this 
scouting mission. We were facing totally unknown territory here. 
Journeying to the fundamental center of Cephiro alone was something 
you were privileged to survive, especially with a maybe hypermodern 
but yet simple battleship. But this... thing was something nobody, 
not even Guru Clef, knew how to fight. If it was even possible to 
fight it. I glanced over at my Second-in-command. Geo stood stoically 
but his eyes betrayed his outer calm. They were scared and that was 
something you saw very rarely within my old and trusted friend.
	&quot;I cannot say I am surprised. Resume the overall scan and 
gather as much information as possible. Give me Ascot.&quot; A screen 
flickered and showed the Summoner, riding a winged monster outside of 
the NSX II. &quot;Yes, Eagle, I hear you.&quot; The young man shivered and I 
was sure it was not from the general arctic cold that reigned this 
area. I could feel it too. The outside area was a mixture of a total 
overload or zero negative zone of magical energy, meaning either a 
spark could initialize a bonfire or even a Spiral Flash of the 
combined Mashin would matter as much as breathing. The feeling was 
straining and I was only a minor mana-adept, channeling mostly 
willpower with technical means. I could not even begin to imagine 
what it had to be like for Ascot who grew up with using magic on a 
high scale.
	&quot;Can you test the void for reaction. We know that the outer 
area should not be there and therefore is unnatural. I&#39;d like to see, 
if there is any different reaction as Clef said we should expect.&quot; 
Ascot nodded quietly not bothering to answer. The scene shifted when 
Geo switched the view to show both the Summonner and the void. Magic 
gathered in Ascot&#39;s hands and he threw a minor blast of white-blue 
flame at the unnatural blackness. The column grazed the void briefly 
and then simply vanished. Nothing else happened.
	&quot;Well, that was...&quot; Geo never finished his statement, then 
the void suddenly flashed once in an eerie gray. Acting out of the 
instinct, I reacted with the speed necessary in this 
moments. &quot;Shields on full power! Prepare for impact!&quot; The command had 
just left my mouth when a sphere of black jumped from the edge of the 
void, a sphere nearly as big as the NSX II herself. A white field of 
fluctuating energy blinked into existence just a moment before the 
projectile impacted with speed that betrayed its size and power that 
was a hundredfold more than expected. I could briefly see Ascot 
creating a shield of his own but wisely hiding behind the battleship. 
But I couldn&#39;t keep track of him. The impact almost sent me to the 
ground. Gripping tightly at my seat, I gritted my teeth and watched 
as the shields of the huge battleship tried to survive under the 
onslaught of colossal energy.
	The NSX II was the first of a new generation. Bigger and 
faster as the first model, was it of a much leaner design and 
equipped with a combination of highly effective mana and old-
fashioned techno-magic weapons. Yet, all that was almost in vain and 
the first semi-official duty of Cephiro&#39;s flagship had also been her 
last. Almost. I breathed a heavy sigh as the energy sphere finally 
despised, barely losing the struggle with the ship&#39;s defense. &quot;Return 
fire! Charge the Phoenix Cannon!&quot; Geo looked at me skeptical for a 
moment but then his face darkened and he went to comply.
	The Phoenix Cannon was a weapon using the ship&#39;s combination 
of Autozam&#39;s and Cephiro&#39;s specialty. A highly dangerous weapon of 
immense power, even greater than the original design of the Laguna 
Cannon. After the thing that was threatening our existence tasted 
this, we would know how strong it really was. Nobody would come away 
with nearly destroying a ship under my command. Nobody.

(Fuu)
For several moments a devouring silence lay over the throne room of 
Cephiro Palace and its four occupants. Master Mage Clef stood 
patiently but years of dealing with the elder of this world were 
enough to know that even he was uncomfortable with the change of 
events. Next to me Ferio had sucked in a sharp breath and had yet to 
release it. My friends always said that I was the most patient one of 
the knights, the most calm, logical and levelheaded one. However, 
logic was defying me right now and calm was a very stretching 
concept. I was not sure, if I really believed what I saw nor if I was 
meant to believe it.
	&quot;Is she for real?&quot; I finally managed, my voice barely above a 
whisper. The small, elf-like warrior in black and white Magic Knight 
armor was not really what could be declared a complete mirror image 
of Hikaru but the eyes, the face, the whole aura. If I would just 
depend on supernatural senses, simply reading the girl&#39;s aura, I 
could have sworn it was Shidou Hikaru, one of my two best friends, 
companion and Fire Knight.
	&quot;It depends on your definition of real,&quot; Clef answered. The 
Guru didn&#39;t show any outward sign of nervousness but seemed to 
periodically stealing glances at the other girl. &quot;As I said. Nova is 
a shadow image, created during your battle with Emeraude. It was pure 
luck that I and Lantis discovered her while the land was crumbling. 
If not, I don&#39;t want to know what the darkness that filled Cephiro at 
this time would have done to her.&quot; Ferio cleared his throat and gave 
the old Guru an uncharacteristic glare. &quot;And you were going to inform 
us about her when?&quot; To his credit Clef didn&#39;t flinch and met my 
husband&#39;s eyes with an even look. &quot;I have done so now, didn&#39;t I?&quot;
	My eyes narrowed and Ferio fumed. Mentally preparing myself, 
I yet again learned that being a Queen often had more down- than 
upsides. &quot;It does seem that you had some valid secrets. This threat 
you were talking about, her... Is there anything more, you want to 
share with us, Guru?&quot; Unlike with Ferio, Ckef averted his eyes to the 
ground, at my dangerous low voice. &quot;I only acted in Cephiro&#39;s best 
interest. With the impending ceremony and meeting, Lantis and I 
didn&#39;t want to worry anyone more than necessary,&quot; he mumbled, still 
not looking up to meet my gaze.
	For a moment my features softened and I was tempted to let 
the matter drop for now, but then my eyes fell on Nova again, who 
seemed to find the whole exchange amusing. It did not bode well with 
me to know, that such a dangerous creature was inside the palace all 
those years, right under our noses. And it was certainly not fair to 
Hikaru who had a right to know of her shadow&#39;s existence. &quot;Did not 
want to worry us?&quot; I repeated, my voice rising but I kept it barely 
under actual shouting. &quot;Damn it, Clef! You don&#39;t have to take 
responsible for everything. For that you have Hikaru, me and the 
council. You cannot hold secrets like this from us. What if something 
would have happened to you and Lantis. Nobody would have known of her 
existence and then she could have easily surprised us all!&quot; Finally 
looking up, the Master Mage answered my challenging stare with a sad 
one of his own. &quot;I had to. It was my duty at this time and it still 
is. The stasis would have held even without Lantis or my existence. 
Nova was simply not ready to be released into the world and the last 
four years had be straining enough for all of you without dealing 
with Nova and the emotional trauma she surely would have caused.&quot;
	We held the contest of wills for several more moments before 
I finally sighed and dropped my eyes to the ground in a gesture of 
defeat. &quot;Alright, it is not my place anyway. You can discuss that 
with Hikaru when she comes back.&quot; Clef blanched but gathered his 
resolve quickly, while Ferio chuckled lightly. The mood effectively 
lightened, I turned towards Nova who had followed the whole scene 
with a light grin. However, apparently my little display of royal 
anger seemed to have impressed her. I could not be fully sure, if her 
actions were out of respect or a light mocking, but she seemed 
genuine when bowing her head. Before I could speak, Nova looked up 
and humbly introduced herself. &quot;My Queen, I am glad to be of service 
to you. I am Nova, Magic Knight of Spirit.&quot;
	That did made me wonder. From Clef&#39;s reluctance about this 
whole matter, I would have gathered that Nova&#39;s personality was a 
bit... different. I stopped in front of her and reached out to lay 
one hand on her shoulder. Nova apparently tried hard not to look 
away. If I compared it to how she dealt with Clef, Nova almost seemed 
meek now. &quot;I greet you Nova and welcome you to the palace. Can I ask 
you something.&quot; The fairy-like girl nodded silently. &quot;I watched you 
and it seems you have more respect for me than everyone else in this 
room. Why?&quot; Nova looked down at her foot again. After a while she 
quietly replied: &quot;Because you are one of Hikaru&#39;s best friends. 
Hikaru loves you, so I love you. When I was first born, I thought 
that everyone Hikaru loves, I hate, because her despair created me. 
However, I learned that you would not ever hurt Hikaru as would Umi. 
That is why.&quot;
	Alright, that made more sense. From what Clef told me, the 
antagonizing response in Nova&#39;s feelings towards anyone close to 
Hikaru was more than understandable. And although it was true that 
Hikaru was a very trusting person, a lot of people tended to take 
advantage of that. Umi and I would never do this, a testament to this 
was Umi&#39;s silence on her feelings in order to spare Hikaru the pain 
of indecision until now. I wondered briefly, what reactions it would 
cause in Nova, when the trip ended as I fear... expected.
	Smiling softly, I stepped closer and embraced the smaller 
girl briefly. Nova stiffened for a moment but then relaxed with a 
relieved sigh. I released her and took her right hand in mine. &quot;Then 
call me Fuu.&quot; 

(Umi)
It was early morning and the sun was just beginning to rise on the 
horizon. There was, as almost always no cloud in the sky and beneath 
us lay the lovely picture that spoke of Cephiro&#39;s beauty. A creation 
we had achieved, all of us together. Call it possessiveness but I 
felt a bit reluctant to open the gateway and allow humanity to share 
this dream of a world. The wide green woods, the high mountains on 
the ground and in the sky, the clear, blue skies... It was like a 
picture book or - as we had often joked - directly out of a video 
game. But Cephiro was real. A peaceful land that had cost us a lot of 
effort to shape and protect. I considered it our world and humanity 
had the bad tendency to stain such beauty. That was why the first 
contact was so delicate and I might have made it even more delicate 
with the events of last night.
	It is worth any complication, I thought to myself. I planted 
a soft kiss on the forehead of the petite redhead leaning totally 
content against me while the winged, blue dragon soared high over the 
land in the direction of the palace. I would trade the world for her. 
I really wanted to enjoy this vacation longer. It was just like Clef 
to first push me into admitting my feelings before it was too late 
and then calling us back after three days on a vacation. Hell, he 
couldn&#39;t have even been sure that I opened up by now. It was pure 
coincidence that the talk had been yesterday. If not, everything 
would have been in vain and I surely would have never had the courage 
again to express my feelings, Hikaru would have married Lantis as 
planned, I would have been back to my old role and everything would 
just have been as before... God, I was rambling in my head and acting 
like a lovesick fool but I couldn&#39;t help it. Hikaru had just laughed 
when I brought my displeasure at Clef up and said that was just one 
thing she loved about me. Okay, maybe I had a temper problem but was 
I really that bad?
	Hikaru turned around in my embrace that was as much practical 
as completely emotional, she didn&#39;t gave me time to further babble in 
my head, when her lips caught mine in a brief, reassuring 
contact. &quot;It&#39;s alright. I tell Lantis as soon as we are back and we 
know what&#39;s going on,&quot; Hikaru told me and traced my cheek with a 
finger. I laughed gently. That was my Hikaru always concerned about 
those she loved. Even if it was not exactly what had been on my mind, 
she knew exactly how to divert my concern. &quot;I&#39;m sure you do. And 
remember, what ever happens, I always love you.&quot; The redhead&#39;s cheeks 
immediately matched her hair color and I was once again surprised 
that sometimes she still acted as innocent as the fourteen year-old 
tomboy I had met this day on Tokyo Tower and shortly after fell in 
love with.
	An indignant cough reminded me of the other passenger on 
Selece&#39;s back. While I could understand the idea, I thought it a bit 
funny to actually sent Primera as a messenger. Her relationship with 
Hikaru was mostly benefited by Primera&#39;s own role as similar to mine 
before. She had stopped her pursuit of Lantis because the Kairu had 
been happy with Hikaru and she was able to see that, eventually. Now, 
with the new development, I could not be sure where she stood with my 
new fianc&eacute;e or if the old rivalry would flare again fueled by 
different motives. I had been embarrassed to say the least, to be 
caught in the middle of Hikaru&#39;s proposal and tried to ignore the 
looks the pixie sent our way.
	Concentrating on the scenery rather than dealing with 
Primera, I noticed that we had reached the palace grounds even more 
quickly than expected. After Primera&#39;s message that we were to return 
to the palace immediately, it had already been late night and we were 
tired from the day. So we decided to rest first and then make an 
early start at the first signs of daybreak. A good thing Selece was 
fairly quick in his natural form. Maybe not so much as Windam but 
that was enough for now.
	Selece made a graceful descend and Hikaru and I jumped down 
in front of one of the side entrances - a giant blue dragon flying 
over the palace was probably enough cause for attraction already. 
Primera flew down also and perched on Hikaru&#39;s shoulder... I blinked 
at that but simply shrugged my shoulders. There was no time for that 
now. Several figures were already coming down the hallway. Amongst 
them Fuu and Ferio and probably Clef from what I could see. There was 
a fourth small shadow that I could not identify but something about 
the form seemed awfully familiar.
	&quot;Hikaru-san, Umi-san, I am glad you made it back quickly,&quot; 
Fuu greeted us. I could tell that there must have been something very 
emotional, because Fuu looked somewhat nervous. &quot;What happened? Why 
did you call us back, Fuu?&quot; Hikaru asked, squeezing my hand softly. 
The action thrilled me, especially in front of our friends. Fuu 
seemed to notice but didn&#39;t comment on it. Stepping out of the 
shadows Clef confronted us with a sad gaze that made me reconsider 
about strangling the twerp elder for his bad timing. &quot;I apologize. 
You are here because I wished so. Cephiro may be in terrible danger. 
I will tell you as soon as the rest is here. But first...&quot; He 
motioned for the figure that had remained in the shadow. &quot;I want you 
to meet someone important, Hikaru. Come out... Nova.&quot;
	When the elfish girl stepped into the light, I immediately 
tightened my grip on Hikaru&#39;s hand. A chill ran down my spine and I 
felt Hikaru shudder at the sight that looked so much like her. Not 
really the outwards appearance but the eyes. The eyes were often said 
to be the mirror of the soul and then I looked into those, I only saw 
Hikaru. Yet... Where Hikaru was in the truest sense light and a 
joyful soul, in Nova&#39;s eyes there was only sorrow, despair and 
darkness.

(Hikaru)
I felt like looking into a mirror. Red eyes were locked firmly on 
mine in curiosity and a bit of playful joy. Yet I could clearly see 
the despair and sorrow deep within. Emotions that were as strange as 
they were frighteningly familiar to me. I knew her. With absolute 
clarity I had the undeniable feeling that I should... No, that I DID 
know her. &quot;Nova...&quot; I repeated the name softly to myself, my heart 
lurched at the sound and my soul wept. Why did I feel like this? What 
was this strange girl that looked so much like me doing to me that I 
was literally frozen in place. &quot;Who... are you?&quot; I finally asked, my 
voice whispered so much that I didn&#39;t think anyone heard. But I think 
Nova did and Clef apparently did as well. &quot;Your shadow.&quot;
	&quot;My... shadow?&quot; The elfish girl stepped closer hesitantly. A 
wave of protectiveness rushed through me and I answered the worried 
squeeze from Umi&#39;s hand with one of my own. It was strange, somehow I 
felt, as if I should be terrified of the girl in front of me but at 
the same time I didn&#39;t want to be. Why was I having this conflicting 
feelings and what did Clef mean with the girl being my shadow? Nova 
softly reached out to trace my face with one gloved finger, earning a 
barely-suppressed growl from Umi in the process, and giggled 
lightly. &quot;Hikaru. I finally met you, Hikaru. I&#39;ve been waiting so 
long...&quot;
	&quot;I... I don&#39;t understand...&quot; She leaned forward catching me 
off-guard when she brushed her lips over my cheeks. Suddenly 
something deep in my heart stirred and memories I had buried deep 
inside came rushing to the surface with an intensity like never 
before. &quot;Iie...&quot; I squeezed my eyes shut, shaking my 
head. &quot;Onegai...&quot; Memories of the final battle which revealed the 
horrible truth about the fate of the Magic Knights. &quot;Yameru... 
Don&#39;t... I don&#39;t want to remember...&quot;
	&quot;GET AWAY FROM HER!&quot; Umi&#39;s outburst snapped me out of my 
trance and I saw Nova stumbling back from a shove and Umi preparing 
to launch a water spell at her. Quickly I caught my new fianc&eacute;e&#39;s 
wrist. &quot;Umi-chan, it&#39;s alright. I&#39;m fine.&quot; The blue-haired girl 
looked at me skeptically but finally dropped her arm. I looked back 
at Nova who seemed to look somewhat guilty about the whole thing. &quot;Do 
you understand now?&quot; she asked softly, slowly closing the distance 
again and taking my hands in hers. &quot;Yes,&quot; I whispered, not able to 
say more.
	&quot;I am called Nova. I am a mirror image of your heart. The 
despair and utter helplessness you felt in the moment where you 
learned about Emeraude&#39;s true wish has created me. I am a reflection 
of your darkest emotions, the side that every human being has, be it 
even as small as in your pure heart.&quot; Yes, she was right. I had felt 
so terrible the moment I learned the truth. That Emeraude had loved 
Zagato, that we had killed him for naught and that we now were forced 
to accept our actual purpose. To kill the Pillar herself. At this 
moment the world had become the harshest and darkest place for me and 
for a moment, for a single, long moment I had felt utter hatred at 
the unfairness of it all. And that feeling, now I recognized it 
clearly, was exactly what I had seen in Nova&#39;s eyes.
	&quot;Is that true, Hikaru?&quot; Umi asked gasping, staring at Nova 
with wide eyes. I simply nodded and pulled the startled girl into a 
tight hug, feeling the need to express my own sadness over the 
situation. However, it was short-lived. Clef turned sharply and began 
to walk into the palace. &quot;Follow me. I must brief you in the 
situation as quickly as possible.&quot; Nova wiggled out of my arms, 
glared at the Guru for some time and then joined me at my left. The 
smile she sent Umi&#39;s way was both dazzling and grateful which caught 
my friend to blush slightly. &quot;Thank you, for taking care of her. You 
are good for, Hikaru.&quot; Before anyone could ask her about the 
statement she started after Clef and we quickly followed. Fuu was 
giving us a long, somewhat strange look before Ferio placed a hand on 
her shoulder and she sighed deeply. After that only silence reigned 
in the hallways where we walked towards the conference room.
	That at least left me some time to think about the rapidly 
occurring events. I was not really sure how Nova fit into all this. 
The armor she wore was similar to ours, it had just a darker touch. 
While it was true that Clef had been searching for the last Magic 
Knight that he told us should be there, the one that manipulate the 
element of Earth, I was sure Nova wasn&#39;t that last one.
	Since she was me in more than just one sense, her general 
powers probably also lay in the fire area. The response I got when I 
tried to read her emotions was confusing and a little scaring. 
Reading her was as easy as understanding myself but what I actually 
saw there troubled me. Her heart was so heavy with depression it 
hurt, yet outwardly she seemed to be the complete opposite, with this 
cheery, cute, little girl attitude. I wonder, if it wasn&#39;t an act. I 
certainly wouldn&#39;t be surprised. Nova seemed to be awfully hostile 
against almost everyone except me. However, the same held true for 
Umi and Fuu which surprised me a bit. Maybe it was because in that 
moment that she was created from my heavy heart, my friends felt the 
same as me.
	I turned my head to the side and saw Umi looking down on me 
with a concerned and thoughtful look. I grasped her hand more tightly 
and she pulled me a little closer. Nova watched this with open 
amusement and a content smile while Fuu tried her best to ignore the 
obvious. I know she must have guessed about us already and knowing 
her, she probably tried to figure out what exactly she was feeling at 
the moment. I decided to gave her some time.
	We finally reached the chamber that was the conference room 
of the High Council. We were expected because when we stepped into 
the corridor, there was Lantis already waiting for us. I only had to 
take one look at his face and knew I wouldn&#39;t need to bother to hold 
up a fa&ccedil;ade in front of him. He knew. He had known all along.

(Ascot)
The onslaught of dark energy was so strong I was barely able to hold 
the barrier, even though I was already partially hiding behind the 
NSX II - who had equal problems with the biggest part of the attack 
dancing over their shield. That wasn&#39;t good at all. I had expected 
trouble but such power was indeed scaring. From my position I watched 
the energy ripping right through reality, simply swallowing 
everything in its path like a giant black hole or one of these things 
Umi told me about. Vacuum cleaner they were called, I think.
	Finally the hurricane of darkness subsided and there was an 
eerie silence except for the natural sound of the howling and wiping 
wind. Zainor was being flung around a lot, despite his enormous size 
and strong wings. The air was high-charged with magical energy and at 
the same time there were unpredictable pockets where no spell would 
work. It was hard to navigate and I did have to anchor my beast to 
not suddenly losing it while flying through a pocket.
	Watching intently, I saw that Cephiro&#39;s flagship obviously 
prepared for a counterstrike. Weapons were readied and large currents 
of magical and mental energy danced over the smooth bluish-white 
shell. They were going all out as it seemed. I had helped a bit in 
devising the Phoenix Cannon and was more than aware of exactly how 
powerful it was. However, personally I would have to reconsider 
before using it here, right in the center of everything that was 
Cephiro. It could cause irreversible damage and might even play in 
the unknown substance&#39;s &quot;hands&quot; by destroying the Mana Nexus. Not 
that I really thought that was possible, even by the Pillar. Nobody 
would listen to me anyway. When it came to combat I wisely stood back 
and shut up, leaving strategy to the more capable ones. The reason I 
was here was getting a feel of what we were up against and a feel I 
got, alright...
	&quot;Oh shit!&quot; I gasped seeing as the nothingness began to 
wobble. Portions of it were spat out and formed into huge creatures 
that had nothing to do with any beast or monster I had ever 
encountered. They were of the same void-like substance - although non-
substantial would probably be the best term to use. At first only a 
few but then dozens began to come out, dozens turned to a 
hundred... &quot;INAZUMA SHOURAI!&quot; Cutting loose with a vast blast of 
lightning I didn&#39;t wait for any indication, if the creatures were to 
attack. Frankly there probably wouldn&#39;t be one needed. The NSX II 
immediately opened fire as well. Blasts of magic and mental energy 
ripping through the air, while more and more energy gathered in the 
center of the wing-shaped weapon on the top back of the NSX II.
	I quickly gathered that magic over large distance was simply 
wasted. You were lucky than a spell avoided the pockets and didn&#39;t 
fizzle out or was severally weakened. The blast fueled with mental 
energy weren&#39;t as effected by this and took out several of the 
creature. I was at a loss of what to do. I was reluctant to let the 
things get any closer and summoning other beast was no option either, 
since the anchoring would take its time, for which I simply didn&#39;t 
have the concentration. Zainor was at least a fire breather and could 
provide natural element power but that wasn&#39;t enough in an 
outnumbered battle like this one.
	I was seriously considering boarding the NSX II when the 
charge period for the battleship&#39;s main weapon had ended. &quot;KAKUEN 
BOUJO!&quot; Fueling every bit of power possible into the spell, I chose 
to be prepared this time for any backlash. The Phoenix Cannon was 
glowing in a bright gold with the concentrated magical and mental 
energy and without further ado was fired. A beam of pure and gigantic 
golden power ripped apart everything in its part and the whole area 
was lit in its light for a while when it impacted with the void. The 
following explosion was so strong that for a brief moment every sound 
and every matter was cast away by it, before the huge energy beam was 
simply sucked into the dark mass. &quot;Uh oh,&quot; I mumbled. The substance 
wavered a bit, trying to absorb the energy and all the creatures were 
suddenly blinking out of existence, as if...
	&quot;Ascot, retreat at once! I don&#39;t think we saw the last of 
them and we can&#39;t fight properly while in here,&quot; Eagle&#39;s voice echoed 
out of my communication earring. He didn&#39;t have to tell me twice. 
Acknowledging the command, I turned my beast around and fled in the 
opposite direction. The NSX II despite its enormous size was rather 
agile and quickly managed a full hundred-eighty degree turn, catching 
up with us quickly. I mumbled a quick chant, reopening the gateway 
that led us to the otherwise completely shielded mana nexus area and 
entered, Cephiro&#39;s flagship close behind.
	Catching my breath, I finally had sometime to think back on 
the events. &quot;What the heck was that?&quot; I asked aloud. As I said, the 
Phoenix Cannon was probably the strongest mechanical device ever 
created in all worlds and this, this... thing simply absorbed the 
whole power. Not without effects alright, effects we probably thanked 
our escape route, but... I had never imagined the capabilities of 
what we were facing here. Clef and Lantis had not exaggerated than 
advising us to the utmost caution.
	&quot;If you are referring to the Phoenix Cannon, we are baffled 
here as well. That creatures though seemed to be made of the main 
mass, that would explain why they disappeared when it dealt with our 
counterstrike.&quot; That was what I suspected as well. &quot;It&#39;s kind of like 
those high-level illusions from Fahren, just more bound to... 
What...?&quot; I turned around as we exited the gateway and therefore was 
the first to see the totally unexpected. The creatures from earlier 
had followed us through. All of them. &quot;That is so not good,&quot; I heard 
Geo comment and could only agree.

(Lantis)
The anticipation I had felt all morning, ever since I woke from the 
barely three hours of sleep, was unbearable. I had been prepared for 
that moment. I really had been. The words laid out, the reactions and 
shown emotions, the understanding yet forced smile. All this was sure 
to come. Albeit Primera&#39;s encouragement that I might have 
misinterpreted what I would find when my fianc&eacute;e returned, I had 
known for sure, any hope was in vain. Last night, after sunset, was 
the final proof when I had felt the bond that linked me to Hikaru 
crumble and finally break. That exact moment the decision had been 
made, there was no doubt about that. Hikaru had finally settled her 
heart for the one person that she wanted at her side, this time for 
sure. And it had not been me. I had been prepared for this. However, 
actually seeing Hikaru with her... I started to realize that someone 
simply could never be prepared for... heartbreak.
	Hikaru had been the first person to touch my heart in this 
special way. A long time I had not really understood how Zagato could 
have fallen for the one person he could never have, even though he 
was loved back. I understood the principle and why it happened 
between my elder brother and Emeraude but I had never experienced it 
for myself. After the tragedy had started I had already known how it 
would end. The legend was to precise and way to real for my brother 
to simply overcome it. I had left Cephiro, choosing to not witness 
the drama enfold in front of my own eyes.
	At this time, I had thought that if that was the price for 
love, I could never bring myself to feel that overpowering yet 
traumatic emotion. My thoughts had solely been focused on crushing 
the cruel Pillar System with my own hands, had become reclusive in 
order to not make Zagato&#39;s mistakes... But... when I had met Hikaru 
and before I knew it, had fallen in love with the next Pillar. Such 
an irony.
	The redhead girl so full of kindness and determination had 
somehow penetrated my shell and made me more aware of how people 
around me felt, she had taught me, if your heart was strong enough, 
you could overcome even the most difficult of hardships. Even being 
the Pillar and being in love. We had managed it, without Cephiro 
falling apart. Actually what we symbolized had been the sign for a 
lot of people to realize that the times had changed. We had become 
the symbol for a new beginning and everyone believed us to be the 
pair that led them into a new age... How ironic again. Just like 
Zagato, it had not worked out. This time though, only for me.
	&quot;Lantis...&quot; The group had stopped. I spotted Nova beside Fuu 
glowering at me darkly yet keeping quiet but my eyes were locked on 
Hikaru. Her hand was in Umi&#39;s and their closeness was speaking more 
than any words. There was a mixture of emotions in Hikaru&#39;s eyes. I 
had become quite good in reading her. Sadness, a tiny bit of doubt, 
the dire need to somehow explain herself, but also a spark of 
determination that proofed that her decision had been made and would 
stand. She took a step towards me and Umi reluctantly let her hand go 
but before she could make another step I turned around and opened the 
door to the chamber. &quot;Come in, we have no time to lose.&quot; If we had 
this discussion now, there was no telling when Clef and I could 
update them on the situation. And for that the situation was to dire. 
I felt that we needed to inform everyone right away.
	I caught Hikaru looking hurt and unsure for a moment and that 
brief expression really pained me but it could not be helped. There 
were more important issues at the moment. Everyone filled into the 
room including Lafarga and Caldina, only Ascot and Eagle were absent 
for reasons only known to me and Clef. While everyone settled down, 
Hikaru never made eye contact which hurt even more, and Umi seemed to 
switched from sad to resigned glances towards Clef. I was much more 
unnerved though by the dark looks Nova kept sending my way. Hopefully 
Clef knew what he was doing. Primera had seated herself quietly upon 
my shoulder, her expression in more than one way unreadable.
	The tension was still evident when Cephiro&#39;s Guru started the 
meeting. &quot;I am truly sorry for the promptness of this meeting and 
apologize, if I stepped over some people&#39;s position dealing with the 
situation but until yesterday evening I had not been sure, if we were 
truly facing a crisis or not.&quot; He looked pleadingly at Fuu who at 
long last nodded but her neutral expression didn&#39;t change. Holding up 
his staff the head glowed blue and an scrying orb appeared in the 
middle of the table, showing the area of importance Clef and I had 
been observing those past days.
	&quot;Is this?&quot; asked Presea who had been silent until now. Being 
Cephiro&#39;s Master Smith and not to mention earning a high rank in the 
new world&#39;s military provided her with a lot of knowledge others 
didn&#39;t have access to. Such as Lafarga, Caldina or Ascot who simply 
stared blankly at the image. Fuu and Umi also seemed clueless, while 
Hikaru blinked a few times before realization crept into her 
eyes. &quot;The Spring of Fundament, Cephiro&#39;s mana nexus,&quot; she simply 
stated, as if it was an obvious thing. Only when she received 
questioning stares from mostly the rest of the council, did she 
elaborate.
	&quot;Cephiro is a land of will, where a believing soul becomes a 
recognizable force. THAT is the force of every magic and the 
concept.&quot; If I wasn&#39;t used to it, I would have been as surprised as 
the rest of them - well except Umi who had spent even more time than 
me with Hikaru. The petite redhead sometimes was a fountain of 
knowledge that was simply just... there, as she put it. Being the 
last Pillar probably had a lot to do with it and who knew, what she 
and Mokona had been talking about since he... it came back a year ago 
for no apparent reason than to be his/its usual annoying pseudo-self. 
Umi hadn&#39;t been very pleased and the fact that she knew about 
Mokona&#39;s real identity didn&#39;t change anything.
	&quot;So, what is the problem here?&quot; my mutual rival asked. Clef 
waved his staff and the image zoomed in. Hikaru&#39;s eye&#39;s 
narrowed. &quot;The void is bigger than it should be. The mantle has a 
simple shielding purpose. It shouldn&#39;t be THAT big.&quot; I nodded, 
deciding to relieve Clef of some of the explaining. &quot;Exactly. Over 
the last days the void has steadily expanded. Outwardly and inwardly. 
At first we thought it had been a natural response to the changes 
Cephiro had gone through lately but... it keeps growing and at this 
rate, whatever is responsible for this growth rate, will either 
swallow the mana nexus and crumble Cephiro&#39;s entire magical power or 
simply eating away reality around it until...&quot; At that point, I was 
rudely interrupted but didn&#39;t think that I really had to finish the 
sentence for anyone in the room present.

(Nova)
I had hung back, drawing as little attention to myself as possible. 
Being a shadow in the widest sense of the word helped immensely. 
While the little twerp informed the rest of the chamber&#39;s occupants 
about the nexus, I let my gaze wander over the gathered people, 
people I had actually never seen and should barely know but still 
did. Hikaru&#39;s memories of them were present in me and they weren&#39;t 
all that pleasant. Which left me confused and my feelings jumbled.
	They had hurt Hikaru and her friends, trying to kill them 
even at one point. Yet, they were friends now. Hikaru&#39;s heart had 
taken irreparable damage during this battle which had ultimately led 
to my birth. I could not quite describe, nor grasp what my feeling 
about this people were. No one had been there to tell me why I was 
born or how I was to deal with the pain and loneliness in my heart. I 
wanted to make Hikaru happy but didn&#39;t have any idea how. On this 
matter I had to agree with Clef that it had been a good thing he and 
Lantis had found me. In my mental state I probably would have fallen 
easy prey to any dark force in the crumbling remains of Cephiro.
	I guess, I had no real problem with Lafarga and Caldina, they 
were all more or less misguided and didn&#39;t know the real reason 
behind Zagato&#39;s actions. The same went for Presea, who did gain a 
higher opinion from me since she and Hikaru were so fond of each 
other from the beginning. The other&#39;s though - I was mainly referring 
to Clef and Lantis - were of an entirely different category.
	Lantis was in my eyes responsible for a lot of pain within 
Hikaru. Though, I had only experienced the events after my capture 
through mental observation that I hadn&#39;t been able to put together 
until now, the Kairu had kept my Hikaru away from her true happiness, 
her true love. He couldn&#39;t make her happy, not completely, not like 
she deserved to be. And he had known it, yet refused to let go. On 
top of it, he had almost succeeded. Zagato&#39;s blind quest for 
Emeraude&#39;s heart had been hard enough on Hikaru but Lantis, although 
everyone claimed he wasn&#39;t like his brother, was as much trouble for 
Hikaru as his brother had been for the previous Pillar. It was more 
subtle but still present. At least for me who I knew Hikaru as much 
as she knew herself.
	Clef... It was a bit more simple than with Lantis. As I 
already mentioned, I didn&#39;t blame him for imprisoning me, that might 
have really been for my own good. However, what made me literally 
hate the small, old Guru was that he had known. He had known right 
from the beginning and even if he simply had followed Emeraude&#39;s 
orders and wish, that was no excuse. Not knowing about the true cause 
was one thing, but knowing and still hiding this truth. I don&#39;t think 
I could ever forgive him for that. He had set Hikaru up for this 
heartbreak, without warning, without the slightest indication that 
their quest was anything less than a honorable, life-saving one. 
Cruel.
	The other knights I had no problems with. Really. It had 
taken me a long time to understand it but I had time to think in the 
last four years of inactivity. Both of them had never done anything 
to hurt Hikaru. Quite the opposite, everyone of the three had at any 
point be ready to give her life for the other two, without regret. 
No, I could not blame them. They loved Hikaru with all their heart 
and Hikaru loved them back. She wanted to be with them, live with 
them and make them happy like they made her happy. That is why I was 
positively delighted to learn that Hikaru had dropped Lantis in favor 
of Umi who was simply right for her. Nobody could know that better 
than me.
	I looked up when the image Clef had formed suddenly went 
black for a moment and then showed another man&#39;s quite frantic face, 
effectively stopping Lantis in mid-sentence. Eagle. Autozam&#39;s 
commander and now General of the new world&#39;s air military. The guy 
was somewhat of a puzzle to me. I knew that he wasn&#39;t much better 
than Lantis in some regards but like Hikaru I couldn&#39;t quite bring 
myself to hate him.
	Pushing these thoughts to the back of my mind for the moment, 
I concentrated on the man&#39;s excited gestures. &quot;Guru Clef! This is the 
NSX II. We require immediate reinforcements for air combat! I repeat: 
Immediate reinforcements for air combat!&quot; Hikaru stood up, concern 
plainly visible in her face. &quot;What happened, Eagle?&quot; For a moment the 
man seemed relieved to see her, when his features hardened and he 
reached for something out of view. The picture switched again, this 
time showing an area not far from the Forest of Silence in which the 
giant battleship and a horde of beasts commanded by Ascot were 
engaged in a fierce battle that left not much doubt who was the 
superior force. &quot;We tried to test the things reaction to hostility. 
Apparently, it didn&#39;t like being shot at. Not that it did anything. 
Clef, the void even absorbed the Phoenix Cannon.&quot;
	There was an uncomfortable silence that fell over the room as 
everyone digested that. I had no real idea what the Phoenix Cannon 
was but judging by the shocked looks it was not something that was 
meant to be simply absorbed. The moment was brief and before anyone 
could take in more than a few breaths, Hikaru straightened up and 
determinedly looked at Umi and then over to Fuu. Both nodded in an 
unspoken agreement. &quot;Hold on there, Eagle. We are on our way.&quot;
	Turning my counterpart was already halfway out of the door, 
before she suddenly stopped and looked back at me. &quot;Do you have a 
Mashin too, Nova? Is there a shadow of Rayearth.&quot; I thought about 
that, hard, then finally shook my head. &quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; There was 
regret that I couldn&#39;t keep out of my voice. I wanted to help Hikaru, 
that is why I had been freed so early anyway but if I couldn&#39;t even 
do that... Closing my eyes briefly, I made a quick decision. &quot;But I&#39;m 
still coming with you. I can call a creature or something else and 
that would be a good time to test my abilities.&quot; Hikaru hesitated for 
a moment but nodded finally, obviously aware of the gravity of the 
situation. Arguing would bring us nowhere.
	&quot;Alright,&quot; Fuu took over. &quot;Everyone else stays in the castle. 
If there are any of these things slipping by us, they should be met 
properly.&quot; With Hikaru&#39;s nod things were authority settled and the 
three Knights hurried out of the room, I floated along silently.

(Fuu)
I had always been complimented for staying calm, even in the most 
peculiar of situations, however, I guess I was still a bit mad at 
Clef for keeping secrets like that. It was not like I wanted to 
intrude in his position as the Guru. As talented as we were, none of 
matched his wisdom concerning everything magical, probably not even 
Hikaru who was more an intuitive source of wisdom. Still, while I 
might be able to overlook the Nova issue and would gladly leave that 
to Hikaru, the departure of the NSX II and Ascot without my knowledge 
was something that would have to be discussed. Later.
	Arriving on of the outside platform, the three of us quickly 
looked at each other. Nova stood a few feet back and obviously waited 
with a summoning spell until we departed. For the first time I was 
really glad that both Mokona and the Mashin had returned a few years 
after the crowning of the Pillar. Nobody really knew why or was going 
to answer that question. And if Hikaru knew, she wasn&#39;t telling 
either. But that didn&#39;t matter know. You simply don&#39;t question the 
wisdom of a creator, after all he probably knew that we would need 
our Mashin again.
	Willing my armor into existence and summoning the Escudo 
sword that marked me as a true Magic Knight, I took the lead, quickly 
followed by Umi and Hikaru.
	&quot;Windam!&quot;
	&quot;Selece!&quot;
	&quot;Rayearth!&quot;
	The next thing I knew was simply switching places from 
outside the castle to the inside of my Mashin. I never really 
experienced any transportation other than the brief sensation of 
green light rushing towards me. &quot;Magic Knights, it is good to see you 
again,&quot; boomed the combined voices of all three mecha. &quot;It is good to 
see you too, Windam.&quot; Unlike Umi who had been out more often, neither 
I or Hikaru had much time for more than brief contact these last year 
and therefore this was quite literally the first we would don the 
Mashin again. Part of me had hoped it would never be necessary again 
in this way. Life just wasn&#39;t fair. That was a fact.
	I looked to my right side. Hikaru had taken her usual 
position in the middle with Umi and myself flanking her. &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; 
our ever-fearless leader shouted. I had to refrain from giggling at 
the thought, apparently my husband&#39;s sense of humor was rubbing off 
on me. Oh well... Mentally willing Windam to move, all three of us 
broke through the dimensional barrier and were positioned right above 
the Forest of Silence, the battlefield only one or two miles in front 
of us. The air was filled with electrical and magical discharged 
energy. Surprisingly Nova was right beside me, on a flying, fiery 
bird of some kind I didn&#39;t recognize.
	&quot;All right,&quot; Umi said, observing the situation. &quot;We go in in 
pairs. Nova you go with Fuu, I&#39;ll go with Hikaru.&quot; Usually I didn&#39;t 
questions Umi&#39;s tactical sense, something she had developed quite 
nicely over the years but there was more than a tiny doubt if that 
set-up was tactical or simply based on feelings. I kept quiet though. 
That was another problem that should be dealt with later. And I mean 
later.
	Apparently Nova had other ideas. &quot;I hate to correct you and 
know very well why you do this. But I think we should split powers 
equally. Hikaru can cause the most damage of all of us, while I don&#39;t 
have a Mashin at the moment. Also Fuu would be left without a serious 
attack addition to her defense magic while you and Hikaru are both 
more offensive than defensive.&quot; Umi started to protest although I 
thought she knew exactly that Hikaru&#39;s... shadow was right. &quot;I can 
watch her, trust me. After all I AM her.&quot; Umi finally gave in but her 
jaw was tightened and she was definitely uncomfortable. Thankfully 
Hikaru took the initiative again, sending an encouraging smile Umi&#39;s 
way. &quot;We need to go, now!&quot;
	With that we raced straight into the battlefield. Shots from 
the NSX II were ripping through the air and into countless enemies, 
Ascot was busy casting lightning spells as well as barriers for 
himself and his beasts. I think we just came in at the right moment...
	&quot;AKAI HA DOU!&quot; A wave of intense heat suddenly sprang forward 
from Hikaru&#39;s outstretched palms and burned its way through over a 
dozen adversaries, consuming them totally. &quot;KAIRYUU NO NAMI!&quot; Umi&#39;s 
spell had much the same effect as a massive tidal wave jumped up and 
crushed several of the indefinable things under the fast and brute 
force. I DID sweatdrop. Apparently I had really been too focused on 
my duties as the Queen, my magic studies had become less and less 
frequent while I knew Umi and Hikaru were steadily training. The 
result was noticeable.
	Wiping these thoughts aside but saving the information for 
later use, I saw a pair of enemies sneaking up on Umi. &quot;MAMORI NO 
KAZE!&quot; Their attacks were deflected by the wind barrier and forced 
them to hastily evade their own shadow attacks. I was quick to follow 
up with an attack. &quot;MIDORI NO SHIPPU!&quot; Umi flashed me a grateful 
smile as the two things disappeared and drew her sword to meet the 
next wave, I did equally, wondering what this battle would bring and 
how long it would take to take down such many foes. Not even to 
mention, if it was even possible... No, that was a silly thought. We 
would succeed, together we always did. And Hikaru was still the 
Pillar after all. No reason to be sloppy though.
	Dispatching another enemy with a quick sweep, I noticed some 
of Ascot&#39;s beasts being pummeled quite brutally by the nameless 
creatures. That sight triggered something in me that was not usually 
a part of my character. I was already a bit mad from the discussion 
with Clef and the discoveries made but seeing these peaceful beasts 
being trashed like this. A bright aura of emerald sprung up around 
me, as I focused my will and anger alike.
	&quot;KAZE NO IKARI!&quot; As the enormous wall of green wind ripped 
apart the torturers, I allowed a brief smile. Who said I couldn&#39;t 
learn new spells, if I wanted to do, hm?

(Umi)
Phew, that was one heck of a spell. I was sure that Fuu had made it 
up just that moment and that said a lot. Stealing a glance over to 
where Hikaru and Nova were I quickly realized that they indeed 
harmonized quite nicely. Except that this made me kind of envious I 
had to admit that Nova had every bit of Hikaru&#39;s fierce battle style. 
Wielding a pair of golden crescent blades she slashed like a raging 
wildfire through the creatures. The energy weapons were going through 
them like a knife through butter. Quite impressive. A Red Lightning 
spell just fried another group - even her magic was the same. Hikaru 
wouldn&#39;t need me for this.
	I whirled around to meet a new attacker and a spear-like 
weapon collided with my sword. Quickly reversing the grip on the 
handle, I slipped it under the weapon and sent it flying. The 
creature was momentarily surprised and that was enough for the 
killing slash. A good thing Hikaru and I had spent so much time 
perfecting and mixing our individual styles of kendo and fencing with 
the other and Cephiro&#39;s primary style. It became handy now.
	A sudden feeling leaded me to look to the side, just in time 
to witness one of Ascot&#39;s beast getting pulverized, the one he was 
currently riding on... &quot;Fuu! Cover me!&quot; Without waiting for an 
answer, I rushed downwards, right into the maze of incoming 
creatures. &quot;MIDORI NO SHIPPU!&quot; The green gale swirled around me and 
cut through the incoming mass. I made a few quick slashes to clear 
the rest and then finally reached Ascot&#39;s falling form. Catching him 
I turned just in time to see two of the creatures rushing in for a 
severe blow... &quot;MAMORI NO KAZE!&quot; Only to be blocked by a wall of 
wind. Raising my other arm, I quickly finished them off with a Water 
Dragon that cut through one and threw the other out of reach and 
right into Fuu&#39;s waiting blade.
	Concerned I looked down at the Summoner. &quot;You okay?&quot; Ascot 
nodded numbly, sadly looking up at the spot where his beast used to 
be. Glancing back, he seemed to think for awhile then asked: &quot;So, how 
did your vacation go?&quot; A genuine smile lit up my face although he 
could not see it through Selece. &quot;Well,&quot; I answered truthfully the 
happiness in my voice evident. &quot;Very well.&quot; Ascot gave a serious nod 
and a tiny smile. &quot;Good. I&#39;m glad.&quot; And there really wasn&#39;t much more 
to say.
	The not-quite-so-little-anymore guy did know and had accepted 
a long time ago that I could never feel for him as he did for me. I 
cared for him alright but if I had ever considered anyone else it 
would have been Clef. I had spent a lot of time with him during my 
and Hikaru&#39;s lessons. But Clef was too much a teacher for me, not to 
mention the awkwardness of dating a guy who was over seven-hundred 
years old and looked like ten... Besides, there was Hikaru and my 
decision on the matter was like stone. Either her or nobody. Both 
Clef and Ascot knew this and never had questioned me about my obvious 
ill-fated devotion. I had won now and that was what counted. Ascot 
wanted to see me happy and that was exactly what I was right now.
	&quot;You better get out of here. Your friends only get hurt or 
worse. We can handle it.&quot; Reluctantly the Summoner nodded, even if 
disappointed to not be of further help, and held up his hand. The 
glow that began surrounding it worked like a magnet, drawing all the 
beasts out of their battles and back from they came from. Ascot 
looked back up at me. &quot;Take care and... Good luck.&quot; With that he 
mumbled something and blinked out of existence. He, the kid - I could 
not help but still compare him to the little imp sometimes - had 
really gotten better.
	Turning back to the battlefield I glared at some of the 
creatures who had previously been engaged with Ascot&#39;s beasts and 
were now focusing their attention on me. &quot;Well, how about taking on 
something your size?&quot; Fuu joined me at my side again and went into a 
defensive stance. I thought for a moment and then came up with an 
idea. Spells of different elements than our own were hard to cast but 
could work. I learned this little trick to counter my own magic, if 
necessary. Now, if I combined it with that, balanced it out right...
	Raising my sword, I took on the standard stance to call 
lightning. &quot;RAIDEN NO...&quot; A loud rumbling could be heard and a 
vicious thunderclap accompanied the lightning that struck down on my 
blade. &quot;NAMI!&quot; True to the name the blast of blinding white lightning 
burst through the air like a tidal wave, similar to my previous 
spell. What was not obvious was that there was actually water magic 
mixed into it, making the electricity highly-effective. When the 
attack hit, it generated a giant detonation taking not only the 
intended group but quite a number of other enemies with it. Oh well, 
even better.
	I looked back to Fuu grinning, catching her staring at me 
blankly for a moment before regaining her senses. &quot;I really ought to 
train my magic more,&quot; I heard her mumble before readying her sword 
and without a further comment rushing back into battle. Shrugging I 
did the same. Fuu was just a bit too hard on herself these days, I 
thought. Lately she shouldered a lot, as well as Hikaru did, and that 
simply didn&#39;t leave her time for intensive studies outside her usual 
schedule. And she really shouldn&#39;t compare herself in this area to me 
and Hikaru. Her skills lay in other areas than ours and magically-
wise our positions required high-level spells. Hikaru was the Pillar 
and even though the title was even more hollow than Hikaru&#39;s I was 
more or less her Soru. A better one in combat than Zagato had ever 
been for Emeraude. Without Fuu&#39;s defensive and healing spells though, 
we probably wouldn&#39;t even live today.

(Hikaru)
This was getting rather annoying, really. They were many, alright, 
but that was about every quality they had to bear against three 
battle-hardened Magic Knights and the best battleship of the NUW (New 
United Worlds, which includes Cephiro, Autozam, Chizeta and Fahren). 
Not even to mention a vicious energy sword-wielding shadow image of 
myself. It was even that annoying that I was going to fall back on 
sarcasm. Only worry for my inexperienced... other self and seeing 
some of Ascot&#39;s beasts getting merciless killed kept my inner fire 
raging and my senses alert. Not that it helped in any way. Those 
creatures were simply no match for us.
	Not bothering to even look, I twisted my body to the right 
which caused Rayearth to mirror my motions and the next not quite 
definable shape of... nothing... sailed past me. I reversed my grip 
on the sword and rammed in backwards knowing that I caused a direct 
hit without looking. That dealt with, I resumed watching Nova dealing 
with a group of four creatures single-handily... Okay, maybe with 
both hands and both blades, but dispatching them quite easily.
	Casually I raised my hand to a pack of two attackers trying 
to sneak up on her. &quot;HOONO NO YA!&quot; The arrow-shaped flame ripped the 
first one apart and was enough to warn Nova of the second. Hurling 
her blades to both sides and this way momentarily forcing her 
opponents backwards, she jumped off her bird right over the heads of 
now five very surprised attackers. &quot;AKAI INAZUMA!&quot; All five bolts 
struck perfectly and left nothing but clouds of smoke.
	I whirled around to plunge my sword in another attacker and 
was surprised to not find it there anymore. My senses flaring I 
reacted with the speed years of training with Umi, Lafarga and Ferio 
had taught me. The attacker I had sensed came down with a blade of 
quite the same substances - if you could even call it that. However, 
although I was sure these creatures looked just like the void around 
the Spring of Fundament, they were indeed quite solid. The blades met 
in a shower of spark and I gritted my teeth. Was it just me, or were 
they getting stronger? A series of quick strokes were met with 
startling speed from my opponent. Even if most of the time had been 
frustrating and the fighter in me longed for a challenge, I knew 
enough that wasting my time with one opponent out of still nearly a 
hundred was dangerous.
	&quot;Shid da me,&quot; I whispered under my breath in a tongue that 
only Emeraude would have recognized... and Mokona. A white light 
flared around my hand and sprung up the fire sword bathing in the 
otherworldly radiance of pure Pillar magic. The creature recoiled as 
if burnt. Smiling smugly, I sent the sword home, the creature 
exploding upon contact. &quot;I don&#39;t always play fair anymore,&quot; I said to 
no one in particular. True, I hated to use my skills as the last 
living Pillar because they reminded me of how powerful I really was 
and if I wanted to I could change the system right back. Mokona had 
told me that much. But sometimes they came in hand.
	My senses already alert flared again and I turned to see Umi 
combine some lightning magic with her own in a tremendous result. 
Recalling my previous thoughts about the improving of our enemies I 
momentarily flew up higher to pull out of the battlefield. My gaze 
went from Fuu to Umi and then to Nova, casting a sidelong glance at 
the NSX II which still had problems with the fast-moving creatures. 
They were getting better... No, wait. Not really better. Smarter. As 
if they picked up our fighting techniques even those who weren&#39;t 
involved with one of my friends before. I knew I was close, the 
solution was nagging on my senses like a swarm of bees that...
	&quot;Ah!&quot; I snapped my fingers. A collective awareness. That was 
what made them harder to kill as time went by. They learned from each 
other. That was why Umi&#39;s combination spell had caught a huge number 
off guard. Quickly I went through a few possibilities to solve the 
situation. Clearly that would not be the last of them, if they came 
directly from the source. And if the collective awareness was 
connected to the source as well they wouldn&#39;t simply take their 
information to the afterlife - granted these things had one. 
Something had to be done now. Right now.
	*Umi, Fuu, Nova, get out of there, NOW!* That was all the 
warning I sent. Actually the Magic Knights couldn&#39;t be harmed, 
actually nobody than the creatures should be but I didn&#39;t want to 
take any chances. Especially with Nova. Mumbling a quick prayer, I 
began reciting a chant in the old tongue and then raised my arms as 
bright white light began to engulf me and Rayearth. &quot;JOUZAI HITOAME!&quot; 
The only thing that prepared the creatures and the crew of the NSX II 
who wasn&#39;t really in danger either for the following action was the 
sudden flash the sun overhead was giving. Then, just like tiny 
meteors, beams of intense white sunlight rained down upon the 
creatures, reducing one after the other into smoke, leaving not a 
single one alive.
	It was over as quick as it had begun and I was glad about it. 
My heart raced a little and my breathing was shallow for the moment. 
I wasn&#39;t used to this high-level spells at all and a lot of the ease 
a Pillar should be able to pull them off went out of the window when 
I had decided to lay part of the responsibility in the hands of 
Cephiro&#39;s inhabitants. To put it into easy words, I was left a little 
drained.
	&quot;Hikaru! Daijobu? Why did you do that?&quot; I smiled weakly at my 
fianc&eacute;e&#39;s usual concern. Biting down on the urge to simply say
that I 
was alright - very well knowing what the answer would be - I 
struggled to first catch my breath before replying. &quot;Gomen nasei, I 
was not very thrilled to do this either as you can see but they kept 
analyzing and learning from each other. If we had fought this out to 
the end, we would have let too much information go.&quot; Fuu looked 
thoughtful, as if she had came to the same conclusion as me. &quot;You 
mean they acted like a collective awareness?&quot; Umi gasped slightly at 
the implication and I nodded. Tumbling a bit, I regained my balance 
under Umi/Selece&#39;s helping hands. &quot;Exactly...&quot; I looked around 
curiously. &quot;Where is Nova?&quot;
	A weak groan sounded from below and I looked down to see Nova 
holding her head in obvious pain. &quot;Hey, could you warn me the next 
time a bit more clarified? I am still connected to you in someway and 
I am not really keen on light magic either, being a shadow and all.&quot; 
I didn&#39;t really know why, but I had to giggle at that, Umi and Fuu 
soon chiming in, while my counterpart just groaned.

(Ferio)
The long hallways were silent as I walked down them to a certain 
direction. The Knights had returned from their battle a while back 
and certain issues had to be... taken care of. There was a lot going 
on at the moment. Hikaru and Umi&#39;s more or less open declaration and 
the changes this would cause, especially in light of the wedding, 
dealing with Lantis in the process of this... Then there was Clef&#39;s 
little solo in dealing with the earlier stage of this new crisis that 
had gotten Fuu so wrapped up. Nova was probably causing much more 
problems than that since I had no idea how to take the &quot;Shadow 
Hikaru&quot;. After the four girls had returned she had disappeared rather 
quickly and I didn&#39;t really know, if I even wanted to know what she 
was doing right now.
	Knocking softly onto the door, I had been standing in front 
of for a minute or so, I finally snapped out of my reverie and walked 
into the room, knowing that I was expected. Presea looked up from her 
studies with a soft smile. &quot;Your Highness.&quot; I grimaced, the Faru just 
loved to tease me with titles in private, although she knew very well 
that I didn&#39;t like that any more than Fuu or Hikaru did. That was 
actually kind of a funny thing. None of the present rulers of 
Cephiro&#39;s new system was quite cut out for the role. We were kids, 
thrown into cold water and mostly lived from reputation and respect 
from the local population, not to mention the backing of the full 
High Council. We wouldn&#39;t have survived in an old-fashioned country 
like, say Fahren or its Earth equivalent China.
	&quot;Would you cut that out?&quot; I replied out of reflex and then 
turned serious. &quot;You wanted to talk to me?&quot; Presea barely suppressed 
a giggle and then nodded, motioning for me to sit. &quot;Actually Clef 
wanted to but he&#39;s presently... occupied, as we both know.&quot; Namely by 
Fuu. I think my wife was overreacting to the whole thing when the 
Guru simply wanted to relieve her of some more worries in her already 
tight schedule but I knew better than to tell her this. Fuu might be 
a gentle and well-mannered soul but she could be pretty stern about 
her beliefs. So it was better to let her and Clef discuss matters. 
Poor guy...
	&quot;What can I do for him? I believe it has something to do with 
our recent problems?&quot; Presea sighed. &quot;Clef didn&#39;t even tell me and I 
often am the first to hear about it when something troubles him. He 
must have been pretty shaken up to be this reclusive. My guess is 
that he really wished it would all turn out to be nothing bigger. 
Still, he should have said something.&quot; Shaking her head, she briefly 
looked down at the table at the table where a large map of Cephiro 
was spread out. &quot;But that is not what I wanted to talk about with 
you. Ferio, you came around a lot of places during your travels, 
didn&#39;t you?&quot;
	&quot;Pretty much the whole of Cephiro, yes. Why?&quot; I replied, not 
really knowing where this discussion was leading. The Faru looked 
thoughtful for a moment. &quot;Did you ever come across anything similar 
significant than the volcano, the floating mountain and the ocean...&quot; 
In other words the three areas where the Mashin temples were 
located. &quot;If you are getting at the fourth...&quot; I started but Presea 
shook her head slightly. &quot;We had this figured out already. No, I&#39;m 
not asking about the possible location of the Earth Mashin. I&#39;m 
rather asking, if where could be any other location we haven&#39;t found 
out about yet. Something related to probably both fire and... spirit.&quot;
	Something clicked in my mind just then and the puzzle pieces 
fell into place. &quot;You mean for Nova?&quot; I didn&#39;t really need an answer 
on that one. Clef had explained about her special abilities besides 
the one she inherited from her creator. &quot;Yes, Nova... Quite a strange 
girl but otherwise... Wasn&#39;t Hikaru-tachi equally strange to our 
land?&quot; I nodded at that, allowing a wistful smile to grow on my lips 
before replying. The old days had been harsh but also good. A lot of 
things had also been easier than they were now with the upcoming 
wedding and first contact with the politics of the other world.
	&quot;Yes, they were indeed. I don&#39;t know what to make out of this 
new addition since she&#39;s even more different than they had been; even 
to them. And to answer your question. I don&#39;t think, I remember 
anything that could pass as another hideout for a Mashin. Then 
again,&quot; I continued with a hint of sadness, &quot;there are a lot of new 
places in the new Cephiro and I never came to travel as much as I did 
in the old days.&quot; And I did regret this somewhat. We all had our 
regrets about the position we had tied ourselves down with but none 
of us ever lamented. Hikaru&#39;s wish had been a Cephiro where everyone 
put their efforts and hearts in and that was exactly like it should 
be. No doubt about that.
	Presea didn&#39;t look that disappointed at my answer. &quot;I had to 
ask. But I guess nowadays I should ask other people about those 
things than our king.&quot; I did register the remark but this time didn&#39;t 
falter. &quot;After all. For all we know Nova is Hikaru&#39;s shadow and was 
created in this world. If there is a Mashin, it could be about 
anywhere.&quot;
	&quot;You could try asking Mokona. Or better ask Hikaru to ask 
Mokona, what she&#39;ll be doing anyway, I guess.&quot; The Faru stood there 
for a moment, as if the simplicity of that possibility just hit her. 
Apparently it had since she was punching herself in the head. &quot;Darn, 
you are right... I guess, I still treat Mokona like... well Mokona.&quot; 
Which was what the thing was acting like anyway ever since it bounced 
back into the castle, as if nothing of the revelations had ever 
happened. More than one of us had uttered the thought that Mokona was 
actually kind of a vessel for the Creator, an avatar to keep an eye 
on his world, that he maybe couldn&#39;t directly intertwine with anymore 
except the choosing of a Pillar. &quot;I can&#39;t blame you,&quot; I said at last.

(Nova)
Cephiro&#39;s palace was a combination of long hallways that tended to 
confuse the hell out of someone who didn&#39;t know their way around. In 
point of fact the structure was not overly complex as you might have 
thought from the central capital of the NUW. Still, you could easily 
get lost without the right directions. Luckily that was one thing my 
mind had been able to pick up over the years of containment. I might 
as well knew the palace like Hikaru did, maybe even more, and so I 
had no trouble to locate my first target of business. The battle had 
been straining but I was still more than healthy to get this done 
with... whatever that was anyway. I was still unsure of the exact 
nature of my planned action, so I simply chose to go with the flow.
	That decided, I wasted no time, standing in front of the room 
thinking. Instead I simply let the - locked - door slight open, much 
to the surprise of the room&#39;s occupant. The dark-haired man looked up 
startled at the intrusion obviously having expected someone else. 
That made sense since my and Hikaru&#39;s aura were exactly the same 
unless you looked closely for the finer points which clearly marked 
me as her shadow.
	Without a word, I stepped into the room and let the door 
close behind me. Lantis stood up casually, his expression unchanging 
while he tried to gauge my intentions. The sight caused a wave of 
pilled-up feeling that came a long way from deep inside to well up 
inside of me. &quot;So? Is there anything I can do for you... Nova?&quot; I 
didn&#39;t answer right away, just stood there for a moment. How to 
handle this? It would be easy to simply give into the impulses and 
strangle the man for the trouble he had given Hikaru but I knew she 
wouldn&#39;t like it. And that was about the only thing holding me back.
	&quot;I take it, you and Hikaru haven&#39;t talked just yet?&quot; Before 
he could answer, however, I already continued. &quot;Anyway, I trust that 
you will respect her decision and finally give her what she deserves. 
Mainly her freedom to choose.&quot; There was a flash in the Kairu&#39;s eyes 
though his face never changed from the cool, calculating stare. &quot;I 
don&#39;t see how it is your business, I never did anything to corner her 
into...&quot;
	He never really knew what hit him, as I exploded forward like 
a wild animal. The next thing he probably realized was being held up 
at one arm against the wall, several items thrown aside, which was 
quite an astonishing achievement for someone my size and built 
compared to his. &quot;Listen and listen carefully,&quot; I intoned, my voice a 
literally feral hiss, &quot;YOU hurt Hikaru, regardless of what you think. 
Your selfishness has cornered her in missing her true love for so 
long and you KNEW it. So, if you ever. EVER hurt her again, I 
swear...&quot;
	&quot;Nova!&quot; The obvious relief replacing the growing fear in the 
man&#39;s eyes was only enraging me further but the sharp but not loud 
command from my other half cut through my anger like a sharp knife 
and was probably about the only thing that held me back from 
fulfilling my yet to be spoken swear. Reluctantly I let the poor fool 
down but not before finishing my prior sentence. &quot;I swear that I WILL 
kill you.&quot; And I think he got it. Kairu he might be, a mighty 
warrior, loyal and prideful but I think he got it.
	Stepping away I turned around to face the disapproving gaze 
of Hikaru and I immediately had to resist the urge to look down. 
Hikaru was so good and innocent, she wouldn&#39;t understand. I was only 
doing what was good for her, what had to be done. Yet, not pleasing 
her made me feel worse than dirt and so it needed all my self-control 
to walk steadily past her and out of the room. I knew she was 
following me, so I simply went ahead through the hall and into an 
unused chamber. Apparently &quot;the talk&quot; would be coming now and I had a 
feeling it would not be pretty.
	There was nothing more that meant more to me than the 
approval and acceptance of my other half. The first meeting had gone 
so well and all three Knights had accepted me with open arms despite 
my origins. Hikaru had accepted me right away, without questions, 
without accusations, a simple embrace for a long-lost... Yes, what 
exactly was I anyway in her eyes? I wanted to know, I wanted to find 
out. Because nothing mattered more to me than for Hikaru to 
understand me as much as I did her. Empty hours in the void and in 
the stasis capsule had only further ignited the craving for someone 
to understand me, to show me what my place in this strange world was. 
And who better could it be than my other half. I had waited so long 
for Hikaru, four, long years. Just waiting.
	&quot;Nova...&quot; This time the voice was softer, more gentle and I 
dared to turn and respond to her questioning gaze. No longer really 
disapproving, more confused. I mentally prepared myself. This talk 
would most likely determine the path of our relationship in the 
future and I suspected that it would not be as easy as the first 
meeting.

(Clef)
Imagine, being over seven hundred years old - looking like ten or so 
I&#39;ve been told - and being scared of an audience with your country&#39;s 
eighteen years-old queen. What an ironic concept. What an ironic 
concept that I found myself in right now. Then again, age never 
mattered that much in Cephiro. Wisdom and skill are valuable 
achievements but what truly mattered was the strength of one&#39;s heart. 
And there was nobody in Cephiro who could match the heart of those 
three girls.
	Those three who were not from our world but had not only 
saved us countless times, they also were the foundation of what 
Cephiro was becoming now. A world where EVERYONE could find his or 
hers happiness. I allowed myself a rueful smile. It had taken us a 
tragedy and the strong will of outsiders to finally let go of the old 
ways and try the brave step in a new future. How truly ironic. I 
suppose being scared of the wrath of one those was not that bad after 
all.
	The doors opened at my gentle knock. There were no guards 
outside the private chambers but the magical field was more than 
enough to fend off any intruders. &quot;Please, come in, Clef-san.&quot; And I 
did, knowing fully well that meeting Fuu in her private quarters 
could be both a good or bad thing. Here she could be both the Queen 
or the polite, reasonable girl - which often could be even harder to 
deal with.
	&quot;Pleasant as always,&quot; I commented, standing in the middle of 
the room. Fuu sat at the table, a tea kettle and two cups present. 
The Wind Knight looked up at me and motioned for the other side of 
the table. &quot;Please have a seat. I am sure the mood will be a lot more 
relaxed over a cup of tea.&quot; I did as I was told and accepted the cup 
of tea Fuu poured me. After taking a few leisure sips in which only 
silence reigned over the room, I collected my resolve once again. It 
was true that I had kept a lot of secrets and that one of those had 
truly hurt the girl in front of me and her friends. I knew that, 
Nova - being a consequence of this - knew it and I think they did as 
well. They never blamed me and I was glad about it. But still... 
Having Nova&#39;s existence revealed to them earlier would have caused 
chaos and a trauma that would have greatly effected the still 
unstable new system. With a growing age and a high position you were 
often forced to make painful decisions. That was the price, I guess.
	&quot;So, you do not regret your actions.&quot; It was a statement, 
spoken softly and even but it managed to shatter the silence 
nonetheless. The side of Houji Fuu that had become a Queen was never 
one of much words or pleasantries. Often one sharp comment could be 
more dangerous than any sword&#39;s edge. She surely had developed a 
bluntness as well. I met her eyes, forcing myself not to wither under 
the intense expression there that seemed to see right through me. &quot;I 
do not, Your Highness. What I did was in the best interest of 
Cephiro. Nova was too unstable to release and too painful of a topic 
to reveal. I have betrayed your trust once, I will not again.&quot;
	Fuu regarded me for a moment before answering. &quot;And yet you 
have.&quot; She continued quickly before I could protest. &quot;It is not easy, 
I noticed. To have so much responsibility. You often have to decide 
what is the lesser evil, what will hurt less in the end.&quot; She cocked 
her head to the side and a small smile was suddenly on her face. Back 
was the politeness that could throw someone completely off guard. And 
she did that change so quick, even my preparation was rendered 
useless. &quot;Demo, as I said. Nova is Hikaru&#39;s responsibility and if she 
wishes to hold a grudge against you for lying to her, she will 
discuss this with you.&quot; Fuu winked at me. &quot;But we both know that 
Hikaru-san is too kind to do that.&quot;
	A very true statement. It was not Hikaru I feared though I 
dreaded the day if I ever earned her wrath. Thankfully that chance 
was very slim. Umi was another story. The Water Knight could be angry 
with me, we had our clashes in the past and though I knew that there 
was a genuine affection building between us, I also knew that her 
heart belonged to Hikaru alone. And therefore I probably had to be 
more wary of her now.
	&quot;The reason I wished to see you,&quot; Fuu continued, her tone of 
voice suddenly being dead-serious again, &quot;is because of the 
unauthorized dispatch of the NSX II in company of Summoner Ascot.&quot; Oh 
man, this could become ugly. I should have been prepared for this. 
After all I knew Cephiro&#39;s Queen for four years now and should have 
expected this. She and Hikaru took their positions very serious. Even 
though they never truly wanted to be rulers it was their wish for a 
safer, happier Cephiro that had helped them to accept those position. 
The new system was for the most part their creation. And though the 
Council and myself had enough influence to counteract them if 
necessary it was true that they were the pillars of the new 
stability. Pillars. Heh, that is an interesting choice of words.
	The point was, both did not like it when their position were 
overridden like this, especially when it concerned the safety of 
their friends. And I had done just that. I had sent both the NSX and 
Ascot into unfamiliar terrain, knowing fully well that avoiding a 
conflict was wishful thinking. And then I looked into Fuu&#39;s... No, my 
Queen&#39;s eyes I realized that this was exactly what was on her mind 
right now.
	No, this truly would be ugly. As she said. It is not easy to 
be a Guru...

(Primera)
Pixies - including both fairies and elves - have a very long life-
span but despite common belief, we weren&#39;t many. The reason for this 
is that pixies rarely enter into relationships. Love is a known but 
not often practiced art that is in the same way rare as it is 
special. In the most cases the life of my kin is spent in harmony 
with nature, we devoted ourselves to a specific task and mastered it. 
Healing and nature pixies were the most common ones. Some even stayed 
hidden within human society and aided them without their knowledge. 
In a few cases some even devoted themselves to protect and care for 
the welfare of one family or person.
	Love was an exclusive thing, saved for only a few selected 
ones. I had not actually searched for it. The painful truth was that 
I hadn&#39;t had anything else to hold onto at this time. My life was a 
dull existence until meeting Lantis and therefore the infatuation I 
had felt upon being rescued by this strong, tall dark-hared human 
quickly grew past simple devotion and liking. Lantis provided an 
anchor to my until then purposeless life and I had grabbed onto this 
anchor so tightly I was sure it would crumble.
	And maybe that was the problem. Inexperienced and desperately 
searching for a meaning to my existence I had not seen the 
complications and difficulties of falling in love, especially falling 
in love with a human. I had been bossy and overprotective, which in 
the end brought nothing else than snapping that thin band of kindred 
spirits that HAD been there before he and Hikaru met. Until then we 
were both searching for a meaning in life, something to hold dear. 
Lantis had found it in Hikaru and I had been scared to lose the one 
thing I thought I had found.
	Looking back on the whole thing, I would have done a lot of 
things differently if I ever had the chance. But I could not change 
time - though there were a few of my kin who could. But could I ever 
have earned his trust and affection before Hikaru dropped into his 
life? No, most likely not. And it really didn&#39;t matter anymore. I had 
learned a lot in these past four years and ironically this learning 
had not so much come from Lantis but from my rival. It had taken me a 
long time to understand it, to understand that you could not force 
someone to love you. And just like that I could not force Lantis to 
simply love me now. What did I expect? That he simply switched his 
feelings and transferred them to me? I did not want that. I didn&#39;t 
want to be loved as the shadow of someone he couldn&#39;t have or just 
for the sake of someone to be loved. I wanted to be loved for what I 
was and what I had become. I could wait, even if it took years or 
never happened at all. I could wait.
	Or that was what I was telling myself, worriedly observing 
the man I still was in love with, or maybe really was in love with. 
Not an infatuation, an obsession but something much deeper. It hurt 
seeing him like this which was probably the best point to prove my 
matured feelings. I could not help but wanting to reach out to him 
and comfort him, giving him some reassurance that at least I would 
never leave him. Lantis was a man of few words but even he needed a 
touch and a gentle word once in awhile.
	&quot;You cannot stop from loving her, can you?&quot; I asked finally, 
disrupting the void that Nova&#39;s departure had left. &quot;You cannot stop 
despite what she said.&quot; I dreaded the answer and had to concentrate 
to not let my fear show. It probably would not do any good. Lantis 
knew me too well to be fooled like this. The Kairu had not left his 
place, leaning against the wall staring at the space where Hikaru&#39;s 
shadow had been and yet staring into nothing.
	&quot;I cannot.&quot; It was a typical answer for him and I really had 
expected it. The feelings were just so strong my heart lurched at the 
sight. Anyone who did not know Lantis would not have known how much 
the whole thing tore his heart apart. Yet, you just had to look into 
his eyes. The struggle was evident there. On a basic level which 
dominated his actions there was the knowledge that Hikaru had to 
choose on her own and had to be free to do so. It was the honorable 
thing to do, the right thing to let her go. But on a more primal 
level his heart could not let go, not yet and most likely not ever. A 
part of his heart would always belong to the cheerful redhead. 
Always...
	&quot;Lantis...&quot; It was not fair. It was simply not fair. The only 
thing I wanted to do right now was reach out to him and comfort him. 
I did not care about me or my feelings. I did not want anything in 
return. If he always would go back to her, if there was someone else 
in the future, someone other than me, that was alright. As long as I 
could be with him, love him and give him someone to talk to, someone 
he could confided in. Was it so much to ask for? Being able to show 
the person you love how much you truly do? I could not do that. As 
small as I was I could not even do anything then sitting on his 
shoulder!
	This... this frustration was eating away at me. I wished for 
nothing more right now than being able to hold him. Providing warmth 
and reassurance in a mere gesture of comfort. Not this, not just 
standing there, my arms tightly slung around me there it became an 
effort not to crush me, my slender body against his... Wait a 
minute... Can we repeat that?
	No, no, no... For a moment I managed to just push the 
realization that came with the thought to the furthest corner of my 
awareness, just relishing in the feeling of being held and being able 
to do so. I did not care for the &quot;whys&quot; and &quot;hows&quot; for the space of a 
few moments which was truly a grand achievement.
	Finally reality won over the dream though and I... stepped... 
I STEPPED back. Lantis was staring at me as if I had grown a second 
head which probably wouldn&#39;t have been as surprising as... I looked 
down at myself. About one meter seventy in height, a slender yet not 
thin figure, the wings still there. Everything was there, just... 
bigger. &quot;Huh...?&quot; was the only intelligible sound I managed before my 
mind short-circuited. How was that possible? I felt so warm inside, 
my heart was literally singing. There was something... something 
inside my heart...
	My eyes that had briefly closed when my consciousness had 
seriously considered fainting fluttered open and I exclaimed with a 
shrill shriek that surely could have been heard on the other side of 
the castle: &quot;HIKARU! WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU DONE?&quot;

(Hikaru)
There we stood in one of the small guestrooms that would come to use 
in a few days time. There were so many things to say, secrets to 
share, emotions to understand about... myself - in more ways than 
one. And yet, yet only silence overshadowed the silent exchange that 
went on between us. Our eyes, so much alike... no, the exact same, 
they spoke of what we could not express aloud.
	I did not know how to approach this strange girl who was me. 
Whoever heard of meeting him- or herself anyway? And what exactly was 
she? Yes, I said I understood and basically I did but there was so 
many things about her I didn&#39;t know yet. That pain, this deep sadness 
and hatred, anger and loathing at herself... myself... It made my 
heart weep, cry out in anguish at her fate although I knew it to be 
mine all along. But she was living it, that part of me. And I just 
could not imagine how it felt like, not totally, not like I should...
	&quot;Nova,&quot; I finally dared to break the silence and took one of 
her hands. I knew she wanted to look away but I made her look without 
touching, just with my eyes. &quot;Why do you hate everyone so much?&quot; Ok, 
not such a grand opening but seeing her with Lantis had scared me. I 
could have sworn if I hadn&#39;t intercepted her that she would have 
carried through that threat right there. It was so different from how 
she treaded me, Umi and Fuu. And to know that a part of myself had 
done that to the man I had loved for four years... still loved and 
would most likely always do even after choosing someone else, that 
was another thing I did not understand about this shadow of my heart. 
And I wanted to understand.
	&quot;He hurt you.&quot; I started to protest but she cut in 
sharply. &quot;Yes, he did. Don&#39;t lie to me, Hikaru! Don&#39;t... just 
don&#39;t...&quot; I was perplexed by the forcefulness of the request. She 
seemed so desperate, so... helpless? Nova held her gaze for a moment 
before turning away, silently pacing through the room. &quot;You&#39;re just 
so good and kind, I know how it is... was... whatever. But I know how 
it is in there.&quot; She turned and tapped a finger to where her heart 
was. &quot;Lantis knew all along that you and Umi were meant for each 
other but he kept you...&quot; A sniff rose from her throat but she shoved 
it down. &quot;But he still kept you away from her, from seeing it.&quot;
	I wanted to scream at her that it wasn&#39;t true, that Lantis 
would never do such a thing, that he was different, not like Zagato, 
that he would have let me go, if he felt that there was someone 
else... And I loved him, still did and ever would. We had this 
already. And I knew that Nova knew this too. Still I could not find 
the strength in me to protest and defend my beliefs from her. She 
wasn&#39;t doing it to hurt me... She just knew it was true. That 
sometimes I was simply too good and...
	I shook my head in an effort to cast away the rebellious 
voice. Maybe it was better to not speak about Lantis anymore. That 
appeared to be a too controversial topic right now. &quot;And what about 
Clef, I noticed that...&quot; Her eyes flashed literally and I think as 
much as she despised Lantis there was something more about Cephiro&#39;s 
Guru, something that stirred a volcano of feelings deep inside of me. 
Safely buried and sealed away... &quot;Clef,&quot; she hissed. &quot;You know very 
well what he did.&quot; I shook my head trying to deny the truth. I knew 
this discussion had quickly reached the root of the problem, the 
reason for Nova&#39;s existence. &quot;He knew. All along, he knew. And right 
there you had no choice anymore he told you!&quot; My heart was bleeding, 
I suppose, just a little but it was enough to once again remember 
that horrible moment. That scream that echoed in my heart and that I 
just wasn&#39;t able to reason or I had surely burst. And even though I 
felt like running, every cell inside of me screamed out to me to get 
away from that hurt, that pain, I still reached out to the trembling 
girl and drew her in close.
	&quot;It hurt...&quot; Nova shook with tremors and I could only hold 
her as I felt tears slide down my own face. &quot;I was alone, no one was 
there... I didn&#39;t... didn&#39;t know what to do...&quot; I could feel my 
clothes drenching but didn&#39;t care right now. With one hand I stroke 
softly through long pinkish hair. It held the same softness than 
mine, the same feel, I realized. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; I whispered and 
meant it. All this problems could wait. That I had to tell her, that 
I didn&#39;t want my friends to hurt even though they might... might... I 
didn&#39;t want that, but it could wait. I think she understood anyway.
	After a long while we separated and Nova looked up to me, 
suddenly serious again, a little sadness was there though. &quot;And that 
is why we can&#39;t just go back to what we were. Maybe once we could 
have... be one again. But you moved on. Four years, Hikaru. You moved 
on and I didn&#39;t. I never could have and most likely never will do...&quot; 
I reached out to caress her cheek but she swatted my hand away 
angrily. I stared at her in surprise. &quot;Don&#39;t pity me. Please, you can 
love me, hate me whatever, but don&#39;t pity me.&quot;
	I thought that over for a moment and realized that pity 
really wasn&#39;t what this other me needed. She needed salvation, to be 
complete again. &quot;I wish I could take you back.&quot; Nova sighed and fixed 
with a gaze that made me shudder. &quot;Can you do that? Can you face all 
that what is me? As I said, you moved on. You know what I said about 
the people who hurt you is true but can you face that? Are you ready 
to accept this truth? You thing you forgave them but did you really? 
Didn&#39;t you just... hid it away, forgot about it. Can you love 
yourself, even the feelings that you felt hurt and betrayed by 
someone you trusted? Can you truly take this part of yourself that 
knows the truth back?&quot;
	I shuddered at her words but could not deny how right she 
was. I could not argue back at her about those things because I 
understood, really understood now that she was all this things. I 
bowed my head and mumbled a soft &quot;No&quot;, before quietly turning and 
fleeing the room. My emotions in utter turmoil.

(Umi)
Night began to enfold Cephiro in a blanket of darkness as I finally 
was able to retreat to my room, sitting down on the bed with a sigh. 
What a chaotic day that had been. Nova, this new threat that nobody 
knew how to deal with, Clef and Lantis having secrets, the battle, 
the consequences... and Hikaru and I had been in the middle of all of 
it. No one really spoke about it but I could feel the awkwardness, 
the looks sent our way. Not really of disapproval. Acceptance, 
sadness, uncertainty how deal with it... Even Fuu was a bit wary, so 
she had busied herself with Clef and the Guru looked royally 
chastised when I saw him later in the evening.
	However, I did not regret my decision. For all the 
complications that surely would come, I did not regret it. For once 
in four years I felt free from that tightly-kept secret that had 
threatened to burst me from the inside. The truth was out and... 
and... she loved me back. Nobody could imagine how good that made me 
feel. They all had practically jumped into their relationships. None 
of them had to patiently sit back, wait and watch the person they 
love go chasing after another for four, long and antagonizing years. 
I had thought it to be the best for her and maybe it had been. 
Innocent, fourteen years-old Hikaru would have not known what to do 
with a declaration of love from one of her two closest friends, not 
to mention another girl. Maybe it really had been better that way. 
But... nonetheless the pain had been hard to bear. Only for her sake, 
I had managed.
	Was I selfish? Probably. But as I said, could they ever 
really understand? One person could only continue giving and giving 
before it became too much. I had reached this point, perhaps just in 
time for me to receive my reward. The only one who might understand 
me was Primera, as funny as this sounds. She was in much the same 
position and even now for her it was harder to express her feelings 
because of the species barrier. Though Hikaru had helped there a 
little.
	I chuckled quietly. After her talk with Nova - which I had 
accidentally listened into - I had caught up with Hikaru a bit later 
after she had to patiently explain a frantic Primera what exactly had 
happened to her body and that she could reverse it whenever she 
wished. As it turned out Hikaru had granted the pixie a wish so to 
say. I hadn&#39;t paid much attention last night when they had talked for 
a moment but I could have sworn there was a small spark of Pillar 
magic for a brief moment. Hikaru had explained that the pixie&#39;s new 
ability to change size was not her doing. She had just provided her 
willpower to grow and fulfill what her heart wished for more than 
anything else at that moment. It hadn&#39;t really surprised me that she 
hadn&#39;t wished for Lantis to return her feelings. As I said, I 
understood very well what Primera was going through.
	A knock on my door rose me from my thoughts and it took only 
a moment for me to identify the aura on the other side. Hikaru&#39;s 
presence could be picked out in the whole castle but with that new 
bond that was growing between us, it became even easier. I stood up 
and opened the door. The sight that awaited me was one that made my 
heart whimper. Hikaru stood there, clad only in a pair of light blue 
pajamas, her head hung low and the whole posture spoke of misery. I 
knew she was faking her calm when she had spoken with Primera but the 
talk with Nova had roused uncomfortable... oh, who was I kidding? It 
had brought out feelings in her that were buried for a long time, 
feelings she didn&#39;t want to face and that tore on her soul. I knew 
exactly what it felt and though I never allowed myself to think about 
it for the same reasons as Hikaru, I could not deny the fact that a 
part of myself always wanted to loathe at Clef for knowing Emeraude&#39;s 
true wish and the sad promise of the old Cephiro behind the legend of 
the Magic Knights. I understood all too well.
	Without a word, I pulled my redheaded fianc&eacute;e inside and let 
the door slide shut. Gathering her in my arms, I held her for a few 
moments, somewhat surprised to actually feel the girl sobbing for 
awhile. Hikaru rarely showed her emotions. I made my point about that 
clear to her a long time ago but she still acted reclusive a 
lot. &quot;It&#39;s okay, I understand,&quot; I mumbled in the soft patch of red 
hair I had buried my face into.
	After a long time just standing there, she pulled away and 
proceeded to wipe some tears from her face. I caught her wrist and 
gently took over the task, showing her how greatly I appreciated her 
trust, that she let me know how she felt. The half-smile somehow 
failed to justify the effort. &quot;I don&#39;t seem to be able to get some 
sleep...&quot; She hesitated for a moment, then almost meekly asked: &quot;Can 
I sleep with you?&quot; For a moment I froze a billion thoughts rushing 
through my mind. Hikaru was someone who did not face her own feelings 
very well. She cared so much for others that there was simply almost 
no time left for herself. If I accepted that request now, I would be 
taking advantage of her and that would be the last thing I...
	I pouted at her sudden giggle, though I can imagine my 
expression must have been quite priceless. Hikaru drew a fingertip 
over my cheek and I shuddered under her touch, before I suddenly 
found myself drawn into a kiss fueled by passion and suppressed 
feelings that left me breathless. &quot;Baka, I meant that I just need 
someone to hold me tonight.&quot; I did not ask why, I knew why and I 
suppose she knew that I had been there as well. That topic could wait 
until tomorrow. Suddenly I realized how short our time to further 
deepen that new stage of relationship had been. The day&#39;s events had 
kept us away from each other and then we were together almost always 
someone else had been there.
	So I simply nodded and lead her back to the bed for some much 
deserved rest... and some pleasantly welcomed snuggles.

------------------------------------------------------------

Nova stirs some more trouble and turmoil. Lantis must make a decision 
of what to do. The Kairu and Umi clash, Hikaru&#39;s decision is tested 
and the first battles with the new menace. Not to mention that the 
wedding and conference with Earth is drawing closer.

Author&#39;s notes

Phew, and another hanging chapter done. I had a lot of those lately 
and with my Christmas fic taking up the whole last month I had no 
time for any of them. Now I finally wrote this last few scenes. And I 
think all in all the chapter was a good one, more deeper plot-wise 
than the last.

What to say about this? Well, I mentioned already that this is Manga-
based but I&#39;m taking a few Anime things into account here. Especially 
some character traits that just weren&#39;t explored as deeply in the 
Manga.
I have been asked if it is not kind of unfair from Hikaru to drop 
Lantis like this and just &quot;jump over&quot; to Umi. It might has seemed to 
be that in the last chapter but I do not intend to leave it like 
that. This IS a Hikaru/Umi-fic after all and if you are a 
Hikaru/Lantis-fan and can&#39;t stand this, you should go somewhere else. 
Also, I think this chapter has brought some more light on the 
feelings of at least three of the four involved parties. I will give 
some more light on Hikaru and also Lantis dealing with the decision 
being made in the next chapter which will be another in-between to 
set the stage. After that the story will most likely be moving faster.
If some of you now think that Nova is rather OOC, I want you to 
consider the last episodes of the Anime. She had been misguided by 
Debonair. Alone and not knowing what to do, without her missing half 
nearby, she had been vulnerable to Debonair&#39;s manipulations. You 
could see her confusion after she abducted Lantis and when Debonair 
wanted to kill her with the other knights. This Nova is just my guess 
at how she could have turned out if she had been found and given time 
to figure out her answers without an evil influence. For now, I know 
that she is rather undefined in character but that is intended that 
way. Her character will form more clearly later. Since she spent a 
lot of time in stasis she&#39;s practically as fresh to the world as a 
newborn, just with an imprint of Hikaru&#39;s memories and darkest 
feeling in her soul.
And now I probably have given away a lot of possible dialogue 
patterns for future use. Oh well... I am sure half of you skip the 
author notes anyway.

Enough of that, more in chapter three. Give me feedback/reviews 
please how you like this story, what you think could be made better 
and so on. We author&#39;s depend on feedback. Addy is in the header.

I hope you all have great holidays/vacation.

Ja ne, yours
