<pre>&#145;&#133;&#146; Thoughts


It has been a few months since they came back from their second trip 
from Cephiro. Hikaru and Lantis did become lovers for a while but it 
didn&#146;t seem to work out between them. It seems the Kairu fell in love 
with the young Autozam commander. Hikaru was kind of surprised but she 
supported it all the way. Besides, Hikaru had gotten over it by a 
certain blue-haired girl. Umi never chose Clef or Ascot. Clef was 
interested into her a little bit until he found out about Persea 
loving him secretly these past years. Ascot was just a friend. He 
could never be anything more than that to Umi. Umi did have this 
strange feeling for Hikaru though. Fuu had been in a relationship with 
the young Cephirian prince. He was really in love with her but she 
knew she had lost the love she had felt for him these past months. Fuu 
seemed to have found love in an unexpected place like Lantis. She was 
in love with Hikaru&#146;s little 13 year-old sisters, Rei. Ferio had 
accepted that and became good friends with Fuu ever since. Rei came 
into the Magic Knights&#146; lives right after they came back from Cephiro. 
It seems she is Hikaru&#146;s half-sister; she came from their father&#146;s 
side. She has red hair and red eyes like Hikaru and her brothers, she 
also learned kendo like the rest of her family, she is about Fuu&#146;s 
height except a few inches shorter, and she&#146;s very genki and energetic 
like her sister, but she is sometimes clumsy.

And this is where our story begins&#133;


Rei and Hikaru were running late for school again. They over slept it 
seems. If it weren&#146;t for their older brother, Satoru, they would have 
never waked up.

&#147;Ne, nee-chan (pant) that&#146;s the last time I&#146;m ever going to watch 
movie marathons with you&#148; Rei said running.

&#147;Well, (puff) you should ignored me asking you&#148; Hikaru said wiping 
sweat from her brow.

&#147;I did, but you kept on bugging me&#148; Rei said running faster.

&#147;Well, (puff) we&#146;re almost there&#148; Hikaru said catching up to Rei.

But when they got to their school, it was closed. Hikaru put her face 
up to the bars and switched into cat-mode like the time when Persea 
caught them in her study room. Rei kept on banging her head on the 
gate and whined. &#147;Now what are we going to do&#148; Rei said looking at 
Hikaru. Hikaru thought for a minute and came with an idea.

&#147;I know! Let&#146;s climb over the walls since the gates are sharp and 
pointy&#148; she said examining the walls.

Rei sighed knowing how many times she had to do this in her old 
school. &#147;And today was my first day at school&#148; Rei said jumping onto 
the top of the wall.

&#147;Ne, Rei Rei-chan, don&#146;t worry. We&#146;re only a few minutes late&#148; Hikaru 
said getting up next to Rei. &#147;More like 30 minutes&#148; Rei said checking 
her watch. When they both got into the building they had to watch out 
for any teachers or hall monitors. When they found the office they 
both made an excuse and gave them both a pass. When they got to their 
classroom, the teacher was in the middle of a lesson.

&#147;Shidou-san&#148; the teacher started.

&#147;Where have you been? You have been 35 minutes late&#148; he said glaring 
at them.

&#147;Uh&#133; I was showing my sister here the school. She&#146;s a new student,&#148; 
Hikaru said pointing at Rei.

&#147;Uh here&#148; Rei said handing the piece of paper to the teacher. He read 
it and was shocked.

&#147;Oh, so you&#146;re the genius student they&#146;ve been talking about&#148; the 
teacher said putting the paper in his pocket.

&#147;Genius?&#148; Hikaru whispered to her sister. Rei blushed and whispered 
back &#145;I&#146;ll tell you later&#146;.

&#147;Class I would like to introduce a new student&#148; the teacher began. The 
class stood up and looked at Hikaru and Rei. Rei smiled and bowed 
down. &#147;Shidou Rei, I transferred from Kyoto. I am also Shidou Hikaru&#146;s 
little sister&#148; Rei said finishing with a smile. &#145;Konnichiwa&#146; the class 
responded. All the girls were looking at her dreamily, which kind of 
scared Rei a bit, and smiled and blushed when she looked at them.

&#147;Okay then. You two may want to sit down. Rei-san you can sit right 
next to Hikaru-san&#148; the teacher said going back to the board.

&#147;Ne, Hikaru&#148; one of Hikaru&#146;s friend started. &#147;That girl is your 
sister?&#148; she sighed dreamily. &#147;Hai, Kiyone-chan&#148; Hikaru said happily. 
&#147;Ohayou&#148; Rei said shaking Kiyone&#146;s hand. &#147;Ohayou&#133;&#148; she sighed 
blushing. &#147;Nee-chan&#133; this is going to be one heck of a day&#148; Rei 
whispered to Hikaru. &#147;Hai&#148; she whispered back as all the girls looked 
at Rei dreamily.

Umi was drawing in her notebook instead of listening to the math 
lesson the teacher was explaining. &#145;Blah, blah, blah&#133; I miss Hikaru, 
Fuu, and Rei&#146; Umi thought looking around the classroom. Nothing really 
changed except the amount of boys falling in &#145;love&#146; with her. &#145;(Sigh), 
I hate it when these boys look at me like that. Especially Ryu&#146; she 
shudders thinking of that blonde playboy. &#145;Ugh&#133; he thinks I&#146;m so into 
him. That baka. I only like, no love or I think its love, one person. 
But I&#146;m afraid to confess it. I know she and Lantis aren&#146;t together 
anymore&#133; but&#133; what if she doesn&#146;t really understand it&#146; Umi sighed 
miserably.

&#147;Ryuuzaki-san! Pay attention!&#148; the teacher said slapping her stick on 
Umi&#146;s desk.

&#147;Hai, Kabitou-sensei&#148; Umi said embarrassed.

&#147;Now back to the lesson&#148; the teacher said turning back to the bored.

&#145;Damn teachers&#146; Umi cursed.

Umi and her friends walked down the hallways and chatted about boys, 
who they like, what they&#146;ll be when they grow up. But then they all 
stopped when they saw Ryu standing right in front of them with his 
friends.

&#147;Hey, Umi&#148; he said coolly.

Umi just turned away signaling her friends to follow her.

&#147;What&#146;s a matter baby&#148; Ryu said running his hand through his spiky 
blonde hair.

&#147;Don&#146;t call me &#145;baby&#146; you baka&#148; she said glaring at him.

&#147;Whoa, whoa. Gomen ne, &#145;Mi-chan&#148; he said leaning on the wall.

&#147;Don&#146;t call me that either you pig! Only one-person can call me that&#148; 
Umi said turning away from him.

&#147;OK, ok, ok. Gooo-men&#148; Ryu said waving his hands up to defend himself.

&#147;C&#146;mon girls, we&#146;re going to miss lunch,&#148; Umi said walking away.

&#147;A little feisty, ne Ryu&#148; one of his friends said.

&#147;Yeah, but that&#146;s how I like them&#148; Ryu said rubbing his chin.


Fuu was taking a test right now and couldn&#146;t concentrate for once. 
&#145;Hm&#133; why do I have her in my mind! Why am I having this strange 
feeling whenever I think of her or when I see her&#146; Fuu questioned 
while looking at her test. &#145;Agh! I can&#146;t think of anything but her! I 
asked Umi-san what this feeling is and she said it maybe love&#133; but how 
can I love her&#133;? How can I love another girl&#133;? Especially when she&#146;s 
your best friends little sister!&#146; Fuu said digging her hands into her 
blonde hair.


Rei and Hikaru were talking about what they should do on Saturday. Rei 
suggested to go to that place Hikaru talked about, but Hikaru was 
worried Rei might get scared again. &#147;I swear nee-chan! I won&#146;t get 
scared&#148; Rei begged.

&#147;You sure&#133;?&#148; Hikaru said raising her brow. &#147;Hai!&#148; Rei said kawaiily. 
And to think she got that kawaii trait from Hikaru. &#147;In fact&#133; let&#146;s go 
now!&#148; Rei said jumping up and down. &#147;But we&#146;re going to need Umi-chan 
and Fuu-chan&#148; Hikaru said trying to calm Rei down.

&#147;Umi-chan? Your girlfriend&#148; Rei said trying to remember her. &#147;Nani yo! 
She is not&#148; Hikaru blushed. Rei smiled at her, as she kept turning 
red. &#147;She isn&#146;t!&#148; Hikaru shouted, &#147;and besides&#133; what about you and 
Fuu-chan&#148; Hikaru said doing the same thing as Rei earlier. Rei smiled 
and blushed faintly thinking of the nice girl. &#147;What about her&#148; she 
asked innocently. &#147;Oh come on now Rei Rei-chan. I can tell by the way 
you look at her,&#148; Hikaru said nudging her with her shoulder.

&#147;Well, you look like me when you look at Umi-chan&#148; Rei said making a 
comeback. &#147;Heh, well&#133; you&#146;re right. I do have these feelings for 
&#145;Mi-chan&#148; Hikaru said looking at the ground. &#147;And so do I for 
Fuu-chan&#148; Rei said doing the same as Hikaru. &#147;Hee&#133; well let&#146;s go get 
them before lunch ends&#148; Hikaru said looking up. &#147;Hai!&#148;

And with that said, they split up to get them and meet at Tokyo Tower&#133;



Hikaru knew where Umi&#146;s school was and it was far. But the faster she 
ran, the sooner she would see the sight of that beautiful blue haired 
angel. After about 10 minutes she finally got there but couldn&#146;t 
really see anything due to her height.

&#145;Agh&#133; now how am I going to find &#145;Mi-chan!&#146; Hikaru thought angrily. 
Then Hikaru heard a familiar laugh. &#147;(Gasp), There she is! Wow&#133; she 
looks so beautiful&#133; not that she&#146;s never beautiful&#133;&#146; Hikaru thought 
walking towards her and her friends. But then someone pushed her and 
accidentally hit Hikaru in the face.

&#147;Oww! (Whimpers)&#148; Hikaru cried.

&#147;Huh?&#148; Umi said recognizing that voice. &#147;Ah, Gomen ne kid&#148; Ryu said 
kneeling down. &#147;I&#146;m not a kid! I&#146;m fourteen&#148; Hikaru yelled. &#147;Oh, 
gomen. Daidouji?&#148; Ryu asked one more time. &#147;Yeah. Hey, did you see 
where Ryuuzaki Umi is&#148; Hikaru said getting up.

&#147;Hikaru&#133;?&#148; Umi said walking towards them.

&#147;&#146;Mi-chan!&#148; Hikaru said happily hugging her. Umi blushed and returned 
the hug. Ryu stared at them and started to feel jealous. &#145;How come Umi 
hugs her and not me?&#146; Ryu thought jealously.

&#147;Hikaru-chan&#133; why are you here&#148; Umi said letting her go. &#147;Well, me and 
Rei Rei-chan were going to Cephiro and we thought you and Fuu-chan 
might want to go&#148; Hikaru said looking in Umi&#146;s eyes. &#147;Sure&#133;&#148; Umi said 
leaning in a bit until&#133; &#147;(Ahem)&#148; &#145;Eh&#146; Hikaru and Umi said face 
faulting. &#147;I already got Fuu-chan, nee-chan&#148; Rei said leaning unto 
them. &#147;And I just wanted to make sure you wouldn&#146;t take to long&#148; Rei 
said kawaiily. &#147;He, he, he&#133; I got Umi-chan&#133;&#148; Hikaru said 
sweatdropping. When they were about to leave, Ryu popped up and 
blocked them.

&#147;Where you going Umi&#148; Ryu said coolly. &#147;None of your business you 
baka&#148; Umi said grabbing Hikaru&#146;s hand and dragging her away. &#147;Ok, ok, 
ok&#133; but shouldn&#146;t a boyfriend know where his girlfriend is going?&#148; 
Hikaru, Fuu, and Rei stiffened at the sound of that. &#145;Boyfriend&#133;&#146; 
Hikaru thought sadly. &#147;Nani!! I am not your girlfriend and you are not 
my boyfriend!&#148; Umi yelled. &#147;Come on, you guys&#148; Umi said still dragging 
Hikaru by the hands.

&#145;Boyfriend&#133;&#146; Hikaru thought again. &#145;&#146;Mi-chan has a boyfriend&#133;?&#146;


When they got there, Rei and Fuu were talking about what they were 
going to do this weekend. Rei even had the courage to ask Fuu out on a 
date.

&#147;Sure&#148; Fuu said happily. &#147;F-F-For real? I mean (ahem) ok. What time 
can I pick you up?&#148; Rei said blushing. &#147;How about 7 o&#146;clock&#148; Fuu said 
taking Rei&#146;s hand. Umi smiled and looked at Hikaru. &#147;Hee&#133; looks like 
Rei and Fuu might be a couple,&#148; Umi said doing the same gesture as Fuu 
to Hikaru. Hikaru smiled and nodded. Umi frowned thinking that Hikaru 
thinks Ryu was a secret boyfriend and is mad at her for not telling 
her about him. &#147;Listen Hikaru&#133; Ryu is not my boyfriend&#133;&#148; Umi said 
lifting Hikaru&#146;s head. &#147;&#133; He sure did act like he was&#133;&#148; she said 
sadly. &#145;(Sigh), well&#133; the only way to convince her is to tell her&#133;&#146; 
Umi thought.

&#147;Well, he isn&#146;t&#133; because I&#146;m in love with someone already&#148; Umi said 
blushing faintly and not removing her eyes from Hikaru.

&#147;Eh? Who?&#148; &#145;I bet its Clef or Ascot&#146; Hikaru thought surprised to see 
Umi looking at her intently. &#147;The person I&#146;m in love with is&#133; well&#133;&#148; 
Umi said nervously. &#147;Who?&#148; Hikaru asked again. &#147;&#133; Why don&#146;t I show 
you&#148; Umi said leaning in. &#147;How--&#148; Umi cut Hikaru off with a kiss. 
Hikaru was knocked off her socks. &#145;This kiss&#133; was so&#133; soft&#133; so&#133; 
tender. When I kissed Lantis or Eagle, it wasn&#146;t like this. Umi&#146;s lips 
were soft and tasted like blueberry, must be chapstick.&#146; &#147;I&#146;m in love 
with you&#133;&#148; Umi said quietly avoiding Hikaru&#146;s gaze. Hikaru stayed in 
silence, not believing what just happened. She was so happy that Umi 
loved her back.

Hikaru hugged Umi knowing that Umi must think that she hates her. Umi 
was surprised to feel her hug her but thought it was a pity hug&#133; but 
Hikaru washed those doubts away with another kiss but this time fueled 
by such passion. When they both pulled apart, they both blushed 
furiously and tried to catch their breath.

&#147;Well, it looks like everybody got what they wanted&#148; Rei said with Fuu 
resting on her head on her shoulders.

&#147;It looks like it&#148; Hikaru said happily looking at Umi.

&#147;Yeah&#133;&#148; Umi said looking back at Hikaru.

&#147;Hm&#133; I wonder what mother, father, and onee-san are going to say&#148; Fuu 
thought.

&#147;Well, I wonder what onii-chan is going to say, ne Rei Rei-chan&#148; 
Hikaru said looking at her.

&#147;Hai.&#148;

&#147;I wonder what mama and papa will think,&#148; Umi thought.

&#147;Well&#133; let&#146;s not waste anymore time&#148; Hikaru said cheerfully. &#147;Hai! 
Let&#146;s go to Cephiro!!!!&#148; Rei yelled with the same enthusiasm but 
tripped. They all laughed while Rei pouted. Fuu tried not to laugh but 
couldn&#146;t help. Fuu helped her up and kissed her on the cheek to make 
her feel better, and she did.


Now in Cephiro, Clef has discovered the old legend about the fifth 
Magic Knight but hasn&#146;t told the girls&#133; yet.

&#147;Sugoi&#133;&#148; Rei gaped at the floating mountains, the volcano, and the 
vast ocean that lied beneath her. &#147;So this is Cephiro, nee-chan&#148; Rei 
asked excitedly. &#147;Hai, it&#146;s beautiful isn&#146;t it?&#148; all Rei could do was 
nodded. They were all riding on Windum&#146;s, his true form, back. They 
were snuggling with their loved ones and talking about going out 
sometime.

Rei started to get really excited and stood up.

&#147;Sugoi&#133; it&#146;s even prettier standing up&#148; she said walking towards the 
head.

&#147;Uh oh&#133; Rei Rei-chan! Don&#146;t stand so close up front!&#148; Hikaru yelled 
worriedly.

&#147;Eh? Why?&#148; Rei said doing her genuine Rei smiles that always looked so 
cocky.

&#147;Because you&#146;ll fall,&#148; Umi said getting worried also.

&#147;Hai, please sit down Rei-chan&#148; Fuu pleaded in a worried tone.

Rei always did what Fuu told her to do. &#147;Ok&#133; AHHHH!!!&#148; Rei yelled as 
she tripped off Windum.

&#147;(Gasp), Rei-chan!&#148; Fuu yelled. &#147;Windum-san, please save Rei-chan,&#148; 
Fuu asked. Windum nodded and squawked.

&#147;AHHHHH!!!!!!! NEXT TIME I&#146;M LISTENING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER THAN 
MEEEEE!!!!&#148; Rei yelled as she felt herself falling faster.

&#147;AHHHHHHH!!!!! HEY&#133;. THIS IS KIND OF FUN!&#148; Rei yelled.

Hikaru, Fuu, and Umi sweatdropped hearing Rei say that was fun. &#147;Ne, 
Hikaru-chan. your sister is very wild&#148; Umi said. All Hikaru did was 
nod.



After saving Rei from falling down to her death, they entered the 
gigantic palace and were greeted by familiar faces. When they went to 
see the prince and the governors and commanders and the important 
people, Ferio greeted them joyously. He noticed Fuu and Rei holding 
hands and stayed silent until, &#147;Ah! So now little Rei here is in love 
with Fuu, huh&#148; Ferio winked.

Rei blushed as Ferio laughed. &#147;Didn&#146;t mean to tease you Rei-chan&#148; 
Ferio said patting her on the back.

&#147;Oh yeah. Clef wanted to see you guys. Well, actually he wanted to see 
Rei-chan&#148; Lantis said.

&#147;Me?&#148;

&#147;Yup.&#148;

&#147;Ok&#133;&#148; Rei said uncertainly.

Clef was Rei&#146;s teacher and trainer so it wouldn&#146;t be hard to talk to 
him.

*Knock, knock*

&#147;Clef-sensei&#148; Rei said cautiously.

&#147;Come in, Rei,&#148; Clef said putting away his book down.

&#147;What is it you wanted to see me for&#148; Rei asked curiously.

&#147;Well&#133; I think you are the fifth Magic Knight&#133;&#148; Clef said slowly.

&#147;No way! That&#146;s so cool&#148; Rei said excitedly.

&#147;(Sigh), Not really Rei&#133; not really&#133;&#148; Clef said sadly.

&#147;Nani? What do you mean&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Have you ever heard of the legend of the Earth Knight&#133;?&#148;
