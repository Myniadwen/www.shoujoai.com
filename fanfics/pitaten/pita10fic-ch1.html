<pre>The Confession

       It was as though I was talking to her for the first time.

       I finally told him. I told Kotaro I liked him. Like all the girls 
who confessed to Ten-chan, I was so nervous. Unfortunately...
      &quot;Kotaro-kun, can we talk?&quot; I asked him, my face red but serious as 
I could be.
       ...Just like all the girls who confessed to Ten-chan...
      &quot;Of course.&quot; He smiled and waited. I gave Ten-chan a look and he 
took the hint to go on ahead. &quot;What is it, Koboshi-chan?&quot;
      I took a deep breath and spoke. &quot;I love you, Kotaro-kun. A lot. 
Would you go out with me?&quot; Not once did I stutter; not once did I divert 
my face to any direction but his. He stared at me for what seemed to be 
the longest two minutes of my life. Finally he cautiously looked away, 
sighed, and turned back to face me.
      &quot;Sorry, Koboshi-chan but...I just want to be friends.&quot; He gave me 
a sympathetic look. I however was too heartbroken to respond. I stood 
there for about five minutes before he decided to leave me in my sorrow.
       ...Just as Ayonokoji refused the advances of his admirers, Kotaro 
had rejected me.
      Somehow, I ended up at my desk. I don&#39;t know if I was late. I 
didn&#39;t care. I didn&#39;t know what to do with myself. I didn&#39;t want to be 
there. I didn&#39;t want to see anyone. I didn&#39;t want to hear what the 
teacher was saying. I didn&#39;t want to hear Ten-chan and Dai-chan fighting 
childishly. I wanted...
      &quot;Little girl!&quot; A voice broke my train of thoughts. &quot;It&#39;s time for 
P.E.! Are you ready to show your overwhelming but un-girl-like physical 
prowess?&quot;
       Who is it, talking to me right now in that annoyingly haughty 
voice? Can&#39;t he see I don&#39;t care about P.E., his stupid competitive 
attitude, and...myself.
      &quot;Go away, Dai-chan.&quot;
      &quot;Eh? What&#39;s that, little girl?&quot;
      &quot;GO AWAY!&quot; I screamed as I stood up, my face red, contorted in 
anger, and I could feel the tears starting to well up. It was enough to 
scare him off.
      I was alone. Alone. Is this what I want? No. I want...I want to 
die. Horrified with the thought that had just occurred to me, I started 
to cry. I put my head down on my desk, hoping I could just pass out.
      &quot;Kotaro-kun!&quot; A loud, impossibly upbeat voice interjected my 
sorrow. I knew to whom it belonged. It must have been Misha at the 2nd 
story window, looking for...him. I heard footsteps next and then felt 
there was a presense next to me.
       Go away. Go away. Make her go away.  Make it go away. Make me go 
away.
      &quot;Koboshi-chan, why are you crying &#39;su?&quot; the older female asked.
      &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot; I didn&#39;t want to talk to her most 
of all.
      &quot;But Koboshi-chan, you don&#39;t look happy &#39;su.&quot;
      &quot;...I&#39;m not.&quot; Not that she should care, her job was to make...him 
happy, and no one else.
      &quot;What happened &#39;su?&quot;
      &quot;It&#39;s not important.&quot; I couldn&#39;t understand why she still 
persisted. Given her short attention span to all things other than... 
him, I was in disbelief as to if she was actually there.
      &quot;Of course it&#39;s important &#39;su.&quot;
      &quot;Why?&quot;
      With the most sincere voice she has spoken to me, she answered, 
&quot;Because, Koboshi-chan, you are my friend.&quot;
      &quot;...W, What?&quot;
      &quot;You&#39;re my friend, Koboshi-chan. Friends care about each other &#39;su 
and listen to each other &#39;su and cheer each other up when they&#39;re sad 
&#39;su.&quot;
      &quot;F, Fine. But can we go somewhere else?&quot; I didn&#39;t want anyone else 
to see me crying, especially...him.
      &quot;Alright &#39;su!&quot; On impulse she grabbed my hands and led me to the 
window.
      &quot;Misha-san, what are you doing?&quot;
      &quot;We&#39;re going to the roof &#39;su!&quot;
      &quot;But the stairs...&quot; Before I could finish she had dragged me out 
of the window.
      I was so scared. I tried not to look down because I knew how high 
up we were. I didn&#39;t want to think about how the pain of falling to the 
ground would feel. When Misha pulled me close to her into a hug, I 
looked up to see her face and saw her wings.
       I had forgotten she was angel. I had forgotten she could fly.
      I was no longer lost in my previous thoughts; I had only one thing 
on my mind &#150; I was flying! It was so amazing; the rush of the wind 
against my face and the speed at which we were traveling was so 
exhilarating that I was a little disappointed when we landed on the 
roof.
      &quot;Are you okay &#39;su?&quot; She asked calmly.
      &quot;A little better now.&quot; We were alone. I was a little better, but I 
was still a little hesitant to tell her anything. Still she waited for 
me to speak. &quot;I told...Kotaro I loved him...,&quot; my voice began to break, 
&quot;but he rejected me.&quot; I couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore and I cried again. I 
felt like a baby. I turned away from her, ashamed. Misha then surprised 
me once again, pulling me into another hug. I laid my head against her, 
getting her blouse soaked in the process.
      &quot;It&#39;s alright, Koboshi-chan. Kotaro-kun may not love you back the 
same way you do, but he still likes you. He still cares about you. He 
would be sad if you weren&#39;t friends anymore.&quot;
      I looked up at her, questioning the truth behind her words. &quot;I 
don&#39;t care.&quot;
      &quot;That&#39;s not true, Koboshi-chan.&quot;
      &quot;How do you know?!&quot; I yelled as I pushed her away. I walked to the 
railing and leaned on it. Looking down, I could see Ten-chan and 
Dai-chan arguing on the track field. As I scanned the P.E. classes, I 
couldn&#39;t see Kotaro.
       Why am I looking for him anyway? I said I don&#39;t care.
      &quot;Koboshi-chan?&quot; I turned to see Misha leaning on the railing. &quot;We 
can still be friends, even if you don&#39;t like Kotaro?&quot; She then proceeded 
to give me one of her famous and sincere smiles. I couldn&#39;t help but 
smile back.
      &quot;Of course, Misha-san.&quot;
      &quot;Yahoo &#39;su!&quot; She tackled me in another hug that almost sent us 
over the railing.
       I have to admit, I like her hugs. I hugged her back.
      &quot;Thank you, Misha-san,&quot; I whispered.


      &quot;Koboshi-chan, wait up!&quot; Ten-chan called out. I sighed deeply, and 
took a glance over my shoulder. Kotaro wasn&#39;t with him. &quot;Kotaro told me 
what happened.&quot;
      &quot;He did, huh?!&quot; I said a little too angrily, making Ten-chan taken 
aback. &quot;Sorry.&quot;
      &quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;m just worried about the two of you.&quot;
      &quot;There is no us.&quot; The silence followed was interspersed by the 
sounds of the other students getting out of school.
      &quot;I&#39;m not going to pretend like I believe you.&quot;
      &quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;
      &quot;...Could you at least talk to him? He feels really bad.&quot;
      &quot;...Maybe...tomorrow.&quot; I needed to cool down. &quot;You can walk with 
him by yourself right?&quot;
      &quot;Yeah, but-&quot;
      &quot;Then I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&quot; My feet proceeded to lead me home. I 
felt like crying again.
      &quot;Koboshi-chan &#39;su!&quot; I turned to see Misha running after me.
      &quot;Misha-san, what are you doing?&quot; I was surprised to see her, but a 
little glad nonetheless.
      &quot;I&#39;m walking home with my friend Koboshi-chan.&quot;
      &quot;But your apartment is the other way.&quot;
      &quot;It&#39;s alright &#39;su. This is what friends do.&quot; She smiled. I smiled 
back.


       It was as though I was talking to her for the first time. I 
didn&#39;t believe I would have actually like her as a friend. But she&#39;s 
more caring than I thought to give her credit for. I can&#39;t wait to talk 
to her again.
