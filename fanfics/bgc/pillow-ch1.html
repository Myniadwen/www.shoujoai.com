<pre>What is the world coming to 
with a devil kissing an angel? 
A kiss that rips open the heart 
manipulates gentleness. 

Priss wiped the bead of sweat from her nose before it could gather and 
fall upon her naked breast.  Only the sound of breathing echoed in the 
dark roomed.  The dull glow of city lights seeping through the blinds 
gave the only illumination.  It was enough to see the peaceful 
expression on her lover&#39;s face. 

Carefully, she rolled to the side and propped her head up on one hand. 
She almost couldn&#39;t believe the look of pure innocence on Sylia&#39;s face. 
It seemed so alien to the expressions she wore during the day.  For the 
hundredth time of the night, she wondered if she only slept like that 
the nights they shared their passions.  Maybe, just maybe, if she knew 
the answer it would soothe the feelings coursing through her. 

Sharing passions, that was the only way she could describe it.  It was 
never tender lovemaking; it wasn&#39;t just lust and desire.  It was a 
different beast altogether.    

Slowly, she pulled herself into a sitting position and rested her 
arms on her knees.    

&#39;How did I let this happen?&#39; 

There was so much confusion and turmoil in her mind in the period 
after Sylvie&#39;s death.  The following days were a jumble of images and 
flashes of emotions.  So much grief and pain...the present had its 
roots in Sylia&#39;s visit to her trailer.  At the time she wasn&#39;t sure why
Sylia had opted to come herself.  Up to that point, she was much closer
to Linna and Nene.  They had no real bond outside of the Knight Sabers 
despite everything they had in common, their hate of Genom, the fact 
that they were the only ones who had ever killed in battle.  She 
couldn&#39;t even remember the last time they had a real conversation. 

Priss found herself rubbing her stomach were Anri&#39;s knife had pierced 
her.  &#39;Dark times...&#39; 

Sylia&#39;s visit was like a seed planted at the back of her mind.    

Her right arm ached in remembrance of the night the crab-like GD-42 
grabbed her.  She could still hear the sharp crack emanating from her
arm.  Sylia had come to her aid once more.  The other shrugged the 
whole thing off as their leader simply showing concern.  They never 
questioned the fact that she had spent the day half naked in Sylia&#39;s 
bed.  The cast was on her arm; nothing could have occurred.    

Priss felt her heart beat faster at the memory.  That night was...
intense. 

By the time Sylia had stripped her of the armor and of the interface 
&#39;soft&#39; suit, the pain killers subsided enough for her to regain control 
of her thoughts.  Sylia had to notice the heat that radiated from her 
body as she re clothed her naked form.  There was no way she could have 
missed the shortness of breath as she carried her limp form from the 
wheelchair to the plush bed and its satin sheets.    

&quot;Sylia...I...sorry, I screwed up again,&quot; She had uttered breathlessly 
as her leader gently took her arm into her hands and began to stroke 
up its length.  Ice and fire licked at her nerves. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think its broken.  More likely a bad stress fracture along the 
length.&quot;  Sylia&#39;s voice remained calm and quiet.  &quot;I&#39;m going to apply 
a cast just in case.&quot;  The process was oddly calming.  The cool 
plaster was being applied by hand.  Watching Sylia was like watching an 
artist at work.  Each movement was expertly measured and applied 
precisely.  She remembered being hypnotized by the motions and the 
soothing feeling along her arm.    

Priss smiled; she knew enough about hospitals and injuries to know 
there were less sensual ways to apply a cast.  Calm-and-collected Sylia 
must have allowed herself a guilty pleasure. That night she waited for 
more.  She expected Sylia to return once more giving into whatever 
urges drove her.  She most definitely did not expect to wake up alone. 

Nothing happened until weeks later.  The others had left the penthouse 
for some reason or another.  She found herself lingering for a moment. 
An explosion.  There was no other way to explain it.  Their eyes met 
briefly only to be followed by one kiss, then another, and some how 
between the stroking hands and lips raining pleasure upon each other 
they made it to the bed. 

No words were ever exchanged.  Nothing progressed further between them. 
Nothing changed in their lives as civilians or as Knight Sabers.  It 
happened three more times before the month had ended.  Their encounters 
might have been the stuff of dreams or figments of their imagination. 

Things had to change when it began to seep into real life.  It started 
as little things at first, a stolen glance, a closing of personal 
space.  But, little things get people killed in battle.    

Priss clenched her fist.  She had almost let Nene die. Miriams toy 
combat boomers were no match for them, but she still left her side to 
assist Sylia.  It was luck the redhead only got her visor smashed open. 

She was lying to herself if she believed that was the only reason her
heart was growing heavy with the entire situation.  

&quot;How could I let this happen?&quot; She murmured to herself once more.  
The mattress shifted beneath her as Sylia rolled to her side.

&quot;Priss, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; The singer closed her eyes.  The voice was like
an angel.  To give it up was....

&quot;I can&#39;t do this anymore Sylia,&quot; She whispered moving to face her 
lover.  Sylia seemed to wilt before her eyes.

&quot;I understand,&quot; The women replied as she rose from the bed and began to
retrieve her discarded clothing.  &quot;You can stay as long as you&#39;d like.
I&#39;ll take the guest bedroom.  Priss, I...&quot;  The women said calmly
suppressing whatever emotion that had begun to well in her heart.

Sylia paused in her steps when she felt the body pressed against her 
back.  The weight of both hands on her shoulders was all that kept her
from fleeing into the night.

&quot;No you don&#39;t.&quot; The voice tickled her ear.  Silent tears ran down her
face.  &quot;I need more than passion.  When we&#39;re one, its indescribable.
But, I can&#39;t keep giving myself when every time I wake up, its all 
gone.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Sylia&#39;s voice choked.  &quot;Please, let me go, Priss.&quot;

&quot;No, I won&#39;t just let you run away.  You know how I feel, Sylia.  I
know how you feel for me.  Why won&#39;t you fight for me?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s nothing else I have to keep you.&quot;

&quot;You fought for me once,&quot; Priss heard her voice grow deep with 
fondness.  &quot;That night on the side of the highway.  Even with the road
rash, it took you what, six moves to put me down.  I know that style 
you use pretty much guarantees three.  I doubt it was the knife, you
had that out of my hands by the first.&quot;

&quot;Priss...&quot; -Just let me go.  End it.  Leave already.  You&#39;ve already
decided to cut loose before your heart breaks once more.-  She felt
the strong hands callused by constant bike riding spin her around.  As
much as she wanted to look away, she couldn&#39;t.  Those brown, almost red
eyes burned into her own.  

&quot;Let me in, Sylia.&quot; 

&quot;I...I&#39;ve never...everything has been about Genom and the Knight
Sabers.  I don&#39;t know how.&quot;  Their foreheads met.

&quot;Say anything.  Give me something, anything but a kiss or caress.&quot;

A moment in eternity passed.  

&quot;Daria.&quot;  A look of confusion passed over Priss&#39;s face.

&quot;It&#39;s an anime, American.  My favorite.  I used to copy it off the 
retro feeds.&quot;  Sylia looked back up and gave a weak smile.

&quot;Its a start.&quot;  Their lips brushed against one another ever so lightly.
&quot;We can work on it.&quot;  The bundle of clothes in her arms fell to the
lush carpted floor.  &quot;Sleep with me, Sylia, just sleep.&quot;  Sylia
nodded as Priss led her back to the bed.  

------------------------------------------------------------

Sylia stared at the ceiling as Priss craddled her neck.  The sunlight
had already begun to warm the bedroom.  No matter what happened in
the future, it was worth it to be waking up in her love&#39;s arms.

------------------------------------------------------------

Author&#39;s Note:

The stress fracture is my take on off Priss being in a cast yet still
have a functional arm in OVA 7: Double Vision.

The fight Priss refers to is my interpretation of Sylia&#39;s running Priss
off the road as depicted in the music video of Asu e Touchdown.

Why Daria? Well besides it being one of my favorite animated series, I
thought it&#39;d be more powerful if Sylia opens up with something most 
people would consider trivial.  It represents just how much she keeps
hidden from others.

And here&#39;s the rest of the lyrics for Akuma To Tenshi No Kiss.

Akuma To Tenshi No Kiss 
(Devil and Angel&#39;s Kiss) 
Lyrics by SHOW * Music &amp; Arrangement by Makaino Kouji 


A Devil and Angel&#39;s Kiss 
cannot be stopped by anyone. 
The lightning that splits the night sky; 
The earth trembles. 

If you feel something too, open 
the windows and close your eyes. 

Scream &quot;Love!&quot; with all your heart 
until you can see light. 
Swear &quot;Peace&quot; in your heart, 
with hope. 

What is the world coming to 
with a devil kissing an angel? 
A kiss that rips open the heart 
manipulates gentleness. 

But if you hold on to something 
go on outside. It&#39;ll be OK. 

Scream &quot;Love!&quot; to someone, 
in your own way. 
Swear &quot;Peace&quot; to someone. 
This is bravery. 

Scream &quot;Love!&quot; with all your heart 
until you can see light 
Swear &quot;Peace&quot; in your heart, 
with hope. 

Scream &quot;Love!&quot; with all your heart 
until you can see light. 
Swear &quot;Peace&quot; in your heart. 
Something will change! </pre>
