<h1>One Step at a Time (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/1step-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Sylia woke up slowly, opening her eyes a crack as she allowed a yawn to 
escape. Linna was still asleep; the younger woman&#39;s nude body snuggled 
close to hers as her head rested near her leader&#39;s chest. As Sylia 
watched her sleep, she thought back on last night.

--

Linna had grown up in the country, under the strict and watchful eyes of 
her parents. Her dates with the men her folks had tried to set her up 
with never went very far due to her curfew and her lack of interest in 
the opposite sex, and she knew of no lesbians in the small town she came 
from. As a result, she was still something of a virgin.

And now, here she was in her bedroom with another woman. No, not just 
another woman; she was with the elegant and beautiful Sylia Stingray. 
She was nervous, afraid of not doing the right thing or somehow not 
living up to Sylia&#39;s expectations.

Sylia meanwhile had removed her skirt and was in the process of taking 
off her top when she noticed the other woman was looking away, &quot;Linna?&quot; 
she asked, &quot;Is everything alright?&quot;

Linna took a deep breath and looked at her, &quot;Sylia,&quot; she began, her face 
blushing a bit from embarrassment, &quot;I... I&#39;ve never...&quot;

Sylia smiled as she gently took Linna&#39;s hand, leading the timid woman 
over to the bed where they both sat down. She then put her arm around 
her, holding her tenderly as she looked once again into her beautiful 
blue eyes.

&quot;Linna,&quot; she said softly, &quot;If you&#39;re scared, or want to hold off...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she answered as she shook her head, &quot;I want to Sylia. I... I 
just... You&#39;re so beautiful, and I...&quot;

Sylia tilted her head, &quot;You&#39;re afraid of disappointing me, right?&quot;

Linna lowered her eyes as she nodded. Sylia reached over and began to 
run her fingers through the other woman&#39;s hair, &quot;Linna, you could never 
disappoint me. You&#39;ve been there for me when I needed a friend the most 
these past weeks, and I&#39;ve had a wonderful time with you tonight. And 
now, rather than worrying about pleasing me, let me worry about 
returning the favor to you,&quot; she said as she leaned forward and kissed 
her. They fell back on the bed, Linna allowing a small gasp to escape as 
Sylia lowered her hand and cupped her right breast.

--

Sylia smiled fondly at the memories. Linna had allowed her to take the 
lead, surrendering herself totally to her hands, mouth and tongue. She 
remembered the younger woman panting under her, thrusting her hips as 
her muscles tensed up, and calling out her name at the moment of 
release. As she looked as her now sleeping form, she once again recalled 
holding her weary form in her arms last night. She&#39;d been right too; 
Linna had been a quick learner, and when she&#39;d recovered and began to 
make love to Sylia, she most certainly did not disappoint her.

She leaned forward and kissed her gently on the forehead. Linna stirred 
a bit and opened her eyes.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Sylia whispered.

Linna looked at her sleepily for a few seconds before the corners of her 
lips twisted up into a smile. &quot;&#39;Morning,&quot; she said as she gave Sylia a 
light peck on the lips. She then snuggled closer as the older woman 
wrapped her arms around her. They lay together silently for several 
minutes, enjoying the sweet intimacy of the moment.

Finally, Linna spoke up again, &quot;Sylia, it&#39;s Saturday,&quot; she said, her 
voice sounding a bit down, &quot;You&#39;re going to have to go back to open the 
Silky Doll soon.&quot;

Sylia sighed heavily as she hugged her closer, &quot;You&#39;ll come to visit for 
lunch?&quot; she asked.

Linna leaned in, &quot;Just try to keep me away,&quot; she said as she kissed her 
tenderly. They pulled back, and Sylia sat up. As Linna gazed at the 
older woman&#39;s topless form admiringly, the leader of the Knight Sabers 
looked over to a wall clock hanging in the bedroom.

&quot;Seven fifteen,&quot; she read. A smile slowly spread upon her face, &quot;And the 
Doll opens at nine-thirty on Saturdays...&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Linna asked as she narrowed her eyes. &quot;Gee, what would you 
suggest we do in the meantime?&quot; she asked with a smirk as she stroked 
Sylia&#39;s upper arm.

Sylia moved back over to Linna, &quot;I think I can come up with something,&quot; 
she purred as she lowered herself on top of her fellow Knight Saber.

------

Mackie walked into the living room as the sun slowly rose upon a new day 
and found Henderson already up and dusting the coffee table.

&quot;Good morning Henderson.&quot;

The butler turned around, smiling cordially as he bowed, &quot;Good morning 
master Mackie.&quot;

As Mackie walked further into the room he looked around, &quot;Is sis up 
yet?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; he answered, adding, &quot;She isn&#39;t here.&quot;

Mackie looked at Henderson with concern in his face, &quot;She&#39;s not here? 
Where is she?&quot;

&quot;She called last night,&quot; he explained, &quot;She stayed over at Miss 
Yamazaki&#39;s.&quot;

Mackie tilted his head a bit at that, &quot;I wonder why she stayed there,&quot; 
he asked as he turned and headed towards the elevator. Henderson watched 
him go with a bemused smirk; after Sylia&#39;s mother died, it was Henderson 
who dried her tears while her father was doing his research. And when 
her father was later killed by Galatia, again it was he whom the young 
child went to for comfort.

He knew her better than most, and he&#39;d seen how much Linna had been 
around during her recovery. Unlike Mackie, he wasn&#39;t blind to what was 
happening. And knowing how much Linna obviously seemed to care for her, 
he was happy to know Sylia had not only found happiness with another 
person since Nigel&#39;s death, but that she&#39;d found it with someone as 
sweet and down to earth as the country girl seemed to be.

&quot;Good for her,&quot; he muttered to himself as he returned to his dusting.

-That Afternoon-

Priss sat in the hospital waiting room, watching the clock slowly tick 
away the minutes. Next to her sat Nene, the blonde eating chips as she 
absentmindedly skimmed through a tabloid from the magazine rack. The 
little computer whiz had volunteered to come along to keep her company 
while waiting. The bland muzak playing over the intercom, as well as the 
smell of disinfectant, was slowly getting on the singer&#39;s nerves.

&quot;Look at this,&quot; Nene muttered as she read one of the articles about an 
actor who left his wife for another woman, &quot;Can you believe that guy?&quot;

&quot;Of course I can,&quot; Priss said irritably as she pointed at the picture in 
the magazine, &quot;The other woman has bigger tits.&quot;

&quot;Priss!&quot; Nene shrieked. The brunette was no longer listening though as 
she got up and strode over to the reception desk.

&quot;Hello,&quot; the boomer behind the desk said, &quot;Can I help you?&quot;

Priss narrowed her eyes, &quot;Yeah, you can help me. I&#39;ve been sitting next 
to Pollyanna over there for the last hour waiting to get this god damned 
cast off my arm. Now what the fuck is the holdup?&quot;

&quot;Priss,&quot; Nene said as she came over, &quot;There&#39;s no need to make a scene, 
we...&quot;

&quot;The doctor will see you shortly,&quot; the boomer receptionist reassured, 
&quot;Meantime, why not take a look at some of the magazines in the waiting 
room or...&quot;

&quot;You know what you can do with your magazines,&quot; Priss growled just 
before Nene grabbed her good arm and yanked her away.

&quot;Priss,&quot; Nene said when they were back in their seats, &quot;You didn&#39;t have 
to do that.&quot;

&quot;Nene, I&#39;ve had this stupid thing on my arm for over a month now. I want 
it off.&quot;

&quot;Sheesh, you don&#39;t have to be a grouch though. And I heard that 
&#145;Pollyanna&#39; comment. If you want me to leave...&quot;

&quot;(sigh) No, you don&#39;t have to leave,&quot; Priss muttered as she rolled her 
eyes. As annoying as the little computer geek was, she at least was 
serving to keep the singer occupied while she waited. &quot;So, how did last 
night go with you and Mackie?&quot; she asked, deciding to change the 
subject.

&quot;It was okay,&quot; she answered, &quot;We invited Sylia to come over, but she 
declined.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t doubt it,&quot; Priss smirked, &quot;I could just imagine her in one of 
her business suits trying to maneuver through that junkyard you call a 
living room.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not a junkyard!&quot; Nene said defensively, &quot;It&#39;s my collection of 
antique computers. And according to Mackie she couldn&#39;t come over 
because she already had plans with Linna or something.&quot;

Priss raised an eyebrow at that. She thought back to her conversation 
with Leon the previous night. Sylia and Linna had been spending a lot of 
time together since the leader of the Knight Sabers had gone sober. 
Could the big lummox have actually been onto something...

&quot;Miss Asagiri,&quot; the receptionist called out as a door to the side 
opened, &quot;The doctor will see you now.&quot;

&quot;About time,&quot; the singer grumbled, setting thoughts of Linna and Sylia 
aside as she headed in to get her cast off.

------

Sylia cashed out the customer, glancing at her wristwatch as she did so. 
As the woman who&#39;d purchased the lacy underwear with the three bras and 
a pair of stockings opened the door to leave, the familiar sound of 
Linna&#39;s moped was heard as it pulled up to the curb. The leader of the 
Knight Sabers felt her heart flutter as the younger woman came in 
carrying a small bag.

&quot;Sorry I&#39;m a bit late,&quot; she said as she reached into her bag, pulling 
out a bento box and chop sticks. She passed them to Sylia as she 
explained, &quot;I would&#39;ve been here sooner, but I didn&#39;t finish making 
these until just before I left.&quot;

Sylia opened the small boxed lunch, &quot;You fixed this?&quot; she asked as Linna 
pulled her own box out.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she said as she opened the lid of her own lunch, &quot;So eat it now, 
while there are no customers around and it&#39;s still warm.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Sylia answered as she reached over and cupped Linna&#39;s 
cheek, &quot;Just as long as you&#39;re there to help again if I need it like 
last night.&quot;

Linna blushed sweetly at the compliment, as well as Sylia&#39;s touch. 
&quot;Sylia,&quot; she said as she looked around, &quot;We&#39;re in public.&quot;

Sylia sighed, &quot;Of course,&quot; she said, grabbing some of the lunch with her 
chopsticks. She was about to eat when she saw Linna lower her head.

&quot;Itadakimasu,&quot; Linna said. She then looked back up and started to eat.

Sylia smiled, &quot;Itadakimasu,&quot; she said, repeating the meal blessing. The 
rest of the meal was spent in quiet conversation about customers, boomer 
managers, and other casual small talk.

At last, the meal was over. As Linna was packing the bento boxes back 
away, a young woman came in and began looking around at some of the 
dresses.

&quot;Miss,&quot; she asked Sylia, &quot;can you help me pick something out for a 
dinner date?&quot;

&quot;Of course ma&#39;am. I just need to take care of something first in the 
back. Linna,&quot; she said as she turned to her fellow Knight Saber, &quot;Could 
you come in the back with me to give me a hand?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Linna asked, &quot;Oh, sure,&quot; she said as she followed her into the 
back room behind the cash register. Once the door was closed behind 
them, Sylia pulled her over, pressing her lips hard into hers as she 
cradled the back of Linna&#39;s head in her hand. Linna closed her eyes as 
her tongue met Sylia&#39;s, her arms wrapping around her as she pressed her 
leader into the wall behind her.

Their lips separated as Sylia pulled back, &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting to do that 
since you came in,&quot; she whispered as she kissed the side of Linna&#39;s 
throat.

Linna&#39;s jaw went slack as Sylia continued to plant warm kissed along her 
jaw line, &quot;Mmmm... Sylia,&quot; she whispered, &quot;Your customer...&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; she answered, &quot;Tonight then?&quot;

&quot;Tonight,&quot; Linna answered, bringing her lips back to Sylia&#39;s.

A few minutes later, the customer looking at the evening gowns watched 
as Sylia and Linna walked out of the back room, both women&#39;s clothing 
looking a bit ruffled. As Sylia went to take care of her customer Linna 
left the store, straightening her hair out a bit as she left.

-Evening-

She stood back stage in her black leather rock-goddess outfit, stalking 
back and forth as she heard the sounds of the audience gathered at Hot 
Legs waiting for tonight.

For her.

&quot;And now,&quot; the owner of Hot Legs Tony Ishimura finally announced from 
the stage, &quot;Back by popular demand, Sekiria with Priss!&quot;

Priss strode out onto the stage like a panther stalking her prey. As the 
audience cheered and the band went to their instruments, she grabbed the 
mike stand and held it high over her head, causing the concert goers to 
go into a frenzy. She smiled self-satisfactorily; she could read 
audiences well. Tonight was going to be a good night.

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; she screamed into the mike as the opening bars of the 
new song they were doing began. The roar of approval that came back to 
her left little doubt to the answer to her question.

------

The construction boomer was an old type 2-F model, a virtual dinosaur of 
a machine that was being used on the site by the contractors to cut 
construction costs. The older boomer was missing most of the newer 
updates intended to safeguard more recent boomer models from potentially 
going rogue.

Late in the evening, it lumbered to the main charger station, plugging 
itself in along with several other boomers as they powered up to 
continue the work on the new office center into the night. If the AD 
Police ever found the 2-F model, the construction company would face 
heavy fines and no doubt loose their contract. The potential for higher 
profit using the cost-cutting procedure though was enough to make them 
risk it.

Unfortunately, something wasn&#39;t right with this particular 2-F. As it 
stood there plugged into the charger, its core went bad. The boomer&#39;s 
form started to slowly deform as it went rogue. Equally unfortunate was 
the fact that it began to infect the other boomers plugged into the 
charger with its defect.

Looking up into the darkening sky, the older boomer gave out a metallic 
yell as tentacles shot out of its back.

Two blocks away from the construction site, Nene sat in a restaurant 
across from Mackie, the blonde eating a large sundae as her boyfriend 
nursed a milkshake.

&quot;So how was Priss today?&quot; Mackie asked.

Nene rolled her eyes, &quot;You know Priss. Geez, she can be such an old poo, 
I swear. I...&quot; the blonde was cut off as an explosion shook the 
building. Both she and Mackie ran outside to see people running in fear 
down the street.

&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Mackie asked a frightened man in a construction hat 
who was running by.

&quot;Rogue boomers!&quot; he yelled, adding &quot;Run for your life!&quot; as he ran away 
from him. Mackie turned around to see Nene running for her scooter. The 
blonde waved him over, and he sat behind her.

&quot;We have to get back to the Silky Doll quick,&quot; Nene said as she weaved 
the scooter through traffic and frightened pedestrians, &quot;Quick, call 
Linna,&quot; she ordered as she took a sharp turn.

Mackie reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out his cell phone, 
hitting Linna&#39;s number on speed dial. After two rings, he heard the 
phone being picked up.

&quot;Hey sexy,&quot; a sultry voice purred.

Mackie pulled the phone away with a stunned look on his face. He stared 
at it for a second or two, and then put it back to his ear. &quot;Linna?&quot;

&quot;Eep... Mackie?&quot; Linna gasped, realizing the &quot;Stingray&quot; on the caller I. 
D. wasn&#39;t the one she&#39;d been hoping for. She could actually feel her 
face turn red. &quot;Uh, er... What&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;Rogue boomers. Meet me and Nene over at Sylia&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Roger,&quot; she said. She then quickly took off the green dress she was 
wearing, put a blouse and pants on, and raced out the door of her 
apartment to her moped.

------

Sylia rubbed her temples as her headache continued to nag her. Her hand 
had been trembling a bit for the last half-hour, but nowhere near as 
badly as it was at dinner last night. She decided when she went to pick 
Linna up later that she would ask if they could just stay there tonight 
and maybe order out. She wasn&#39;t feeling her best right now, and all she 
wanted was to just rest her head on Linna&#39;s shoulder while the other 
woman held her close.

For now though, she had to first close the Silky Doll before she left. 
As her headache continued to plague her, she reflected how easy it would 
be to just wash down two or three aspirin or other painkillers with a 
shot of brandy. But of course she&#39;d sworn off alcohol, as well as her 
little junior pharmacy she had in her medicine cabinet. As she was about 
to lock the door, she heard it; Linna&#39;s moped. Her fellow Knight Saber 
must&#39;ve decided to come and visit her at her place instead. She smiled 
as she saw her girlfriend park the small vehicle and get off.

Her smile quickly faded as she saw the look on Linna&#39;s face, as well as 
Nene and Mackie racing around the curb to park next to the office lady&#39;s 
moped. Linna reached the building first, bursting through the door.

&quot;Linna,&quot; Sylia asked as she ran to keep up with her, &quot;What...&quot;

&quot;Rogue boomers,&quot; she called over her shoulder. She and Sylia entered the 
secret elevator, and were soon joined by Nene and Mackie. As the 
elevator quickly descended, Sylia hid her shaking hand behind her as her 
head continued to throb.

------

As Linna and Nene leaped from one roof to the other, Sylia began to 
think about how ridiculous the situation was. What the hell were people 
thinking keeping the boomers around, especially after the whole Galatia 
incident? She remembered volunteering to give a speech to the Japanese 
Parliament, as the daughter of the man who invented boomers, on why 
boomer technology should be abandoned.

The letter she got back politely told her to stick to selling women&#39;s 
lingerie and keep her nose out of politics.

&quot;Um, sis?&quot;

Sylia turned to Mackie as she continued to massage her temples, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Are... Are you sure you should be here?&quot; he asked, &quot;I mean...&quot;

Sylia put a hand on his shoulder, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; she reassured, 
&quot;Besides, I am the leader of the Knight Sabers. I have to get back into 
the swing of things some time.&quot; She then turned her attention to the 
command center in front of her as she spoke into a speaker, &quot;Linna, 
Nene, are you there yet?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Linna answered, &quot;We... Good god...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Sylia asked in alarm, &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Sylia,&quot; Nene broke in, &quot;This thing looks like it&#39;s made up of a bunch 
of boomers fused together somehow.&quot;

&quot;What? Mackie, get over to the control panel and get me visual,&quot; she 
ordered crisply, adding, &quot;Any word yet from Priss?&quot;

&quot;No, nothing. She must still be performing. I&#39;ve left nine messages 
already.&quot;

&quot;How many encores does that woman need?&quot; she asked exasperatedly as the 
shake in her hand seemed to increase.

Mackie meanwhile got his sister the visuals on the monitors around her 
so she could see what the two Knight Sabers out on the field were 
seeing. The thing lurching towards them was made up of six or seven 
construction boomers fused together, arms and legs of two of them 
becoming twisted into claw like fingers. Long, grotesque tentacles 
stretched into the night sky from it. It towered a good twelve to 
thirteen feet above the young women looking up at it.

&quot;Nene, you try to attract its attention,&quot; Linna commanded, &quot;I&#39;ll start 
work on the tentacles. Let me know when your sensors pick up the core.&quot;

&quot;Will do.&quot; Nene said, as she fired her needles at the monster&#39;s face. 
Linna leaped up to begin cutting away at the tentacles with her ribbon 
cutters.

Then everything went to hell.

One of the thing&#39;s hands reached out and grabbed the ribbon cutters, 
leaving Linna suddenly dangling helplessly off the ground. It then swung 
her, hard, towards a brick wall.

&quot;Fuck...&quot; was all Linna was able to get out before impact.

&quot;Linna!&quot; Nene and Sylia both screamed in unison.

Nene&#39;s scream got the boomer&#39;s attention. Using the ribbon cutters as a 
sling shot, it swung Linna into her, knocking them both into a steel 
girder. Linna&#39;s visual feed abruptly cut out.

&quot;Linna!&quot; Sylia screamed, &quot;Nene! Answer me, damn it!&quot;

------

&quot;Hello? Anyone? Hello?&quot; Linna finally gasped out. The wind had been 
knocked out of her when she had landed, and she was still seeing spots 
before her eyes. All around her she could hear noises; crashes, 
scrapping, the roar of the boomer; but she couldn&#39;t see anything. She 
tried to get up, but couldn&#39;t move.

&#145;Am I paralyzed?&#39; she thought. She tried to wiggle her toes, sighing 
with relief when she succeeded. But she still had no audio feed, no 
monitor to show her what was happening around her, and her suit was 
frozen in place.

&quot;The son-of-a-bitch smashed my internal battery,&quot; she muttered to 
herself. In the old suits, even when the battery went dead, you could 
still force some movement out of it. Such was not the case with the 
second generation suits. Her mind raced back to Priss telling her about 
when her suit went dead in the last battle against Galatia, how she 
couldn&#39;t move anything at all. In Priss&#39; case, she had the Motoslave to 
come save the day.

Nigel had said it was a simple design flaw with the liquid metal. Not to 
worry he told her and the others, he&#39;d have it worked out eventually. 
Unfortunately, he was killed before he could work out the problem. And 
since Linna didn&#39;t have a motoslave of her own to come rescue her, the 
only thing standing between her and that hulking monstrosity out there 
was Nene.

Being cut off and unable to move, she also realized there was no way to 
let anyone know she was still alive. And with her hardsuit&#39;s power gone, 
there was no way to recycle air and no way to open her visor. If someone 
didn&#39;t help her, and fast, it was only a question of whether or not the 
boomer or carbon dioxide poisoning did her in, and she knew it.

------

&quot;Linna! Linna!&quot; Nene was screaming at the figure on the ground.

Nothing. No movement. Not a word.

Nothing.

Sylia, for her part, was watching the visuals coming in from Nene&#39;s 
visor with a horrified look in her eyes. &quot;No,&quot; she whimpered, clutching 
the sides of her head as tears began to form at the corners of her eyes, 
&quot;Not again. Please...&quot;

&quot;Sylia, Mackie, what do I do?&quot; Nene cried out, &quot;Where&#39;s Priss? Sylia!&quot;

Sylia stood up and ran at top speed to the room with the suit chambers, 
stripping her clothes off along the way as fast as she could with her 
shaky hands.

&quot;Sis,&quot; Mackie asked, panic evident in his voice, &quot;what are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Initiate the liquid metal immersion!&quot; she commanded as she ran into the 
room.

&quot;What?&quot; he asked incredulously, &quot;Sis, you can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;The fuck I can&#39;t!&quot; she yelled as the door shut behind her, &quot;I&#39;m going 
in!&quot;

End Notes: A bento box is a type of traditional Japanese lunch box. 
Also, &quot;Itadakimasu&quot; is the traditional meal blessing said before meals 
in Japan and roughly translates to &quot;I humbly receive.&quot; Coming from the 
country, it occurred to me that Linna would probably say the traditional 
Shinto prayer before eating her lunch.</pre>
