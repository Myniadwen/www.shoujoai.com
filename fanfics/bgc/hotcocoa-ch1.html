<h1>Hot Cocoa</h1>

<pre>&quot;I should call...&quot;  Priss sighed and shook her head.  Linna and her 
boyfriends.  It could be sickening.  &quot;Oh, but I don&#39;t want to give in 
to him!  What do you think about Yachi, Priss?&quot;  The singer rolled her 
eyes.  &quot;C&#39;mon now, be honest!&quot;

&quot;I think he&#39;s a jerk, Linna.  You can do better.&quot;  The girl blinked.  

&quot;What?  It&#39;s true.  He said you wore too much lipstick, so you don&#39;t 
put it on until you get to work.  Even then, you clean it off before 
leaving.&quot;  Linna sighed and sat down.  How long had Priss been hinting 
that this guy was an asshole?  Since she showed up, to help Linna 
resist the urge to call him and let him know that their date for 
tonight was on.  &quot;If he wants a lipstickless girl, he should date one.&quot;
Linna grinned; the singer was right.  Beneath that cold fa&ccedil;ade was a 
really caring, smart person.  

&#39;Sure, she rushes into certain situations without thinking, but it&#39;s 
not like she doesn&#39;t have common sense.  I,&#39; Linna suddenly stopped her
line of thought.  &#39;What...was I about...to think?&#39;

&quot;Hey, ya al&#39;right?&quot;  Linna nodded, grinning.  &quot;Good.  Now, just 
remember not to call that bastard.&quot;  Linna sighed, realizing she&#39;d 
strayed in the general direction of the phone, and went back to sit 
next to Priss.  This time, something was weird - no - different.  Not 
weird.  Good, but different.

Priss smiled.  &#39;Good.  That guy treats her like such dirt.&#39;  Linna 
stretched and yawned, closing her eyes.  &quot;Damn, been working out, have 
we?&quot;  Priss said teasingly.  Linna blushed, suddenly becoming self 
concious and put her arms down.  However, with her eyes (still) closed, 
one rested on Priss&#39; leg...

&quot;Oh!  I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

&#39;But I don&#39;t want her hand to move...&#39;  Without really thinking about 
it, Priss put her hand on top of Linna&#39;s, stopping the older girl from 
moving it.  &#39;Shit, what the fuck am I doing?&#39;  Priss moved her hand and 
got up, walking toward the window.  Tokyo was so pretty this time of 
year, with the snow falling.  &#39;Perfect time to get some cocoa, curl up 
on the couch and...&#39;  Priss blinked.  &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;  Priss, realizing she&#39;d said something aloud shrugged.

&quot;Just thinking aloud.  Tokyo&#39;s quite nice this time of year, not much 
traffic.&quot;  Linna chuckled and pushed herself up off the couch, moving 
toward the kitchen.

&quot;I suppose.  It&#39;s too cold though.  So, cocoa?&quot;  Priss blushed.

&#39;Ah, fuck.  Damn you body, DAMN YOU!  It must be because I&#39;m here that 
I keep thinking about her.&#39;  Priss agreed, and continued staring out 
the window.  &#39;Snow.  So beautiful...just like Linna.&#39;  Priss sighed, 
defeated.

&quot;Somethin&#39; wrong, Priss?&quot;

&quot;Nawh...I have a question though.  Have you ever...liked...a...girl?&quot;  
Linna&#39;s blush was almost as deep as Priss&#39;.

&quot;Um...why do you ask?  Crush on a girl?&quot;  The older girl chuckled, 
trying to hid her nervousness.  &quot;Very funny.  Actually... yes, I have.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;I wrote her a short note, telling her how I felt.  Later - in the 
worst way, might I add - I found out she was very homophobic.&quot;  Linna 
realized that Priss was sitting next to her - with her arm around her.  
Even if it was in pity, Linna felt good.  &quot;She read the note out loud 
to the class.  I knew most of the people in there were homophobes, and 
I became the laughing stock of the school.  I was almost removed from 
the track team, but the coach was a good friend of mine.&quot;

&quot;Awh, shit Linna, I&#39;m sorry.  I&#39;d have never done that to you.&quot;  Linna 
smiled and hugged Priss.

&#39;Fuck, I basically told her I love her...&#39;  Finally, the cocoa was 
ready.  Linna handed Priss her cup, and the two moved to the window.

&quot;That&#39;s why I hate the snow.  It was snowing the day I gave her the 
note.  You know, Priss, there aren&#39;t many people I can trust in this 
damn world.  I&#39;m glad you&#39;re one of them.  I&#39;ve not told Sylia or 
Nene.&quot;  Priss chuckled.

&quot;Not like I will.  Besides, Linna,&quot; she looked around shyly, very 
uncharacteristic of Priss, &quot;I&#39;m bisexual myself.&quot;  The green Knight 
Saber chuckled and have Priss another playful hug.

&quot;I thought you might be.&quot;

&#39;God damn it, you&#39;re SO coming on to her!&#39;  Priss smiled; Linna melted.

&quot;Priss, it&#39;s my turn.  Have you ever liked...another Knight Saber?&quot;  
Priss - who could normally control these kinds of things - turned even 
redder, if possible.

&#39;It&#39;s obvious now, no point in lying.  Besides, if I were to lie to 
her, it might drive her further away, after that story...  I don&#39;t want 
that.&#39;

&quot;Yeah, acutally.&quot;  Their eyes met; they saw exactly the same thing 
refelcted in one another&#39;s eyes.  The same feelings, the same person, 
the same secret longing.  &quot;What about you...?&quot;  Priss said quietly, 
knowing the answer.

&quot;It&#39;s you...&quot;  Linna blinked, once, twice, and turned away, moving 
quickly toward the kitchen.  Priss grabbed her shoulder and stopped 
her.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry Priss!  It&#39;s not like I-&quot; but Priss placed her finger 
gently over her lips.  &quot;Just say what you want to say now, Priss.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind Linna.&quot;  Leaning toward the slightly shorter woman, Priss 
placed a gentle kiss on her lips.  &quot;I love you too, infact.&quot;  Half a 
dozen emotions flashed across Priss&#39; face in half a second.  Relief, 
surprise, gentleness, calm, realization, and most importantly, love.  
Linna moved toward her and hugged the rock star tight.

&quot;I love you too...y&#39;know.&quot;</pre>
