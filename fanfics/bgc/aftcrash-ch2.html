<h1>After the Crash (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/aftcrash-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The next evening and much later at night, rock music
pounded through the club Hot Legs, nearly shaking down
the walls. Up on stage Priss sang like a woman
possessed, her performance leathers clinging to her
body as she egged the audience on. Familiar faces and
newbies filled the audience, their happy cries giving
her even more energy.

Her blonde wig fell into Priss eyes as she grinned,
raising the microphone to her lips, &quot;Here&#39;s another
favorite, and I&#39;m dedicating it to Genom!&quot; With a
laugh she sang &#39;Piece of Crap&#39; by Neil Young, enjoying
hearing the laughter and cheers of her audience.

Genom wasn&#39;t too popular these days, with the recent
boomer uprising still fresh in people&#39;s minds, but
Priss had no illusions that it was going to last. The
company was still the biggest employer in Megatokyo as
well as one of the most powerful corporations, and
they would be able to buy or bribe the populace into
loving them once again.

&#39;Still,&#39; Priss thought with a impish grin, &#39;it&#39;s nice
to be able to tell &#39;em off without being shouted down
by some jerk.&#39;

&quot;You were on fire tonight, Priss,&quot; her lead guitarist
smiled wryly later as they group headed off stage and
back to the dressing rooms. .

&quot;Hell yeah,&quot; the drummer agreed, his shaggy mop
falling into his eyes.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Priss said softly, feeling a profound sense
of relief. Since the Replicants had gotten a contract
and split she had been without a back-up band, and
this new group had only just started out. But
thankfully they all seemed to be jelling, and it
looked like the beginning of something more.

&quot;Catch you later,&quot; the guys took over one dressing
room, leaving Priss to use the other.

With a tired sigh Priss went in the dressing room,
briskly toweling off the sweat from what she thought
was one of her better performances. Her leather top
and skirt clung to her body, the quickly discarded
blonde wig left hanging on the back of her chair.

Despite trying to focus on the concert Priss still
found herself silently cursing herself for what had
happened yesterday, for what she said and how she
reacted. &#39;Sylia was opening up,&#39; Priss thought to
herself angrily as she dried sweat from her short
brown hair, &#39;telling us her deep dark secrets! And I
freaked, damn it!&#39;

One of the band&#39;s roadies thumped on the door then he
stuck his head in, his messy brown hair giving him a
sheep-dog look. &#147;Hey Priss, there&#39;s a good looking
chick here to see you,&quot; he grinned. &quot;Pretty cool if
you like the office lady type.&#148;

&#147;Don&#39;t call them chicks,&#148; Priss said to him sourly,
keeping her back to him. &#147;Who is she?&#148; she asked, a
sudden sinking feeling in her gut.

&#147;She says her name&#39;s Cecilia or som&#39;thin&#39;,&#148; he
grumbled sullenly.

&#147;It&#39;s Sylia. And bring her in,&#148; Priss said to him in
her &#39;don&#39;t mess with me, or I&#39;ll tear you a new bodily
orifice&#39; tone.

He gulped loudly in terror and then scurried away to
obey the order with haste. Ever since she had kneed
one of the roadies in the groin for trying to feel her
up, they sure jumped when Priss wanted something done.
It may not have been textbook employee/employer
relations, but it worked. A soft knock, and Priss
turned to open the door.

Sylia smiled at Priss as she walked in, carrying a
purse and looking utterly in control. Back in her
ice-queen business suits again she looked like her old
self, but Priss thought that she could see a new
softness in Sylia&#39;s eyes. &quot;Sylia,&quot; Priss nodded.

&#147;Hello Priss,&#148; Sylia said mildly as she took in the
messy room, &#147;I was a little worried about you, so I
thought I&#39;d drop in.&#148;

Priss smiled back at her shyly, &#147;I was hoping to see
you tonight.&quot; Running a hand through her hair she
sighed, &quot;I wanted to apologize for making such an ass
of myself yesterday.&#148;

&#147;It&#39;s all right,&#148; Sylia started to say, only to have
Priss stop her speech with a sad smile and a raised
hand.

&#147;No, it&#39;s not.&quot; Priss looked said, &quot;I was a real jerk,
and I&#39;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;Apology accepted,&#148; Sylia said gently, a impish smile
on her face.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Priss blushed, quickly realizing that she
was standing in front of Sylia dressed in nothing but
what amounted to a leather sports bra and a
mini-skirt. Not that Sylia ever seemed to notice
things like that, but still!

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Sylia asked, eyes searching
Priss&#39;.

Instead of answering Priss softly asked, &#147;Would you
please sit down?&#148; She smiled a bit as she explained,
&#147;You always intimidate me standing up.&#148;

&#147;I intimidate you?&#148; Sylia said in a surprised tone of
voice, sitting down in the offered chair. &#147;I was just
thinking I wished I could be more like you.&#148; Priss
gave Sylia such a surprised look that Sylia had to
laugh. &#147;I mean, I&#39;m such a boring person in a lot of
ways,&#148; Sylia confessed, &#147;I wanted to be more exciting,
like you.&#148;

&#147;Trust me, you&#39;re not boring,&#148; Priss said, feeling
suddenly shy. She turned from Sylia&#39;s level gaze to
grab a top and roughly pulled it over her head. Still
facing away from her, Priss said softly, so that Sylia
could barely hear &#147;You have always interested me.&#148;

&#147;Really?&#148; Sylia asked her. She stepped up behind Priss
and softly put her hand on Priss&#39;s shoulder. With a
gentle pressure, she turned Priss around so they were
facing each other, looking eye to eye. &#147;I never really
thought you noticed me.&#148;

&#147;You&#39;re so hard to read,&#148; Priss said, her voice
deepening a bit. &#147;I would see something in your eye,
then it would just go away.&#148;

Sylia tapped her temple with a rueful expression,
&#147;Faster thoughts, remember? Whenever I though about
you, I would just shove it away and bury it as quickly
as possible. You do work for me, it wouldn&#39;t be
right.&#148; She blushed a bit, &#147;I&#39;ve been having those
thoughts more and more, though.&#148; She smiled and
shrugged helplessly.

&#147;Good,&#148; Priss said, gently cupping Sylia&#39;s face in her
hands. Sylia smiled encouragingly to her, and Priss
leaned forward to place a soft kiss on Sylia&#39;s lips.

&quot;Priss,&quot; Sylia looked searchingly into her eyes as she
asked, &quot;are you all right with what you&#39;ve learned
about me?&quot;

Priss kissed her again, gently. &quot;I overreacted,&quot; she
said, &quot;no matter what, you&#39;re still the stubborn,
occasionally bad tempered and cool woman that....&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Sylia asked with a dangerous look I her eyes.

&quot;That I fell in love with,&quot; Priss finished.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Sylia confessed before pulling her into
another kiss.

Author&#39;s Note: This is a little piece of fluff written
after I saw the Bubblegum Crash collection, and I
wanted to see a resolution to the Sylia/ Priss
situation. Crash really disappointed me in some ways,
in that it was much lower in quality and in complexity
compared to the earlier Crisis series. I did like the
new hardsuits, though.

Sylia&#39;s enhancements come from pieces of dialog in
Crisis and Crash, as well as Adam Warren&#39;s Bubblegum
Crisis Comic book, Grand Mal. I began to consider that
she might have physical enhancements when I realized
that Sylia, in the episodes I&#39;ve seen, was never
seriously injured on panel. Also, Sylia&#39;s cold,
emotionless facade was something I could also explain
that way, as well as why the romantic tension between
her and Priss never went anywhere.

Priss is very hard character for me to try and write,
because of the personality changes that she goes
through. In &#39;Crisis&#39;, she hated boomers at first, then
&#39;bonded&#39; with Sylvie and Anri, and is horribly
effected by their deaths. But in the &#39;Crash&#39;
storyline, she&#39;s reverted to her earlier &#39;I hate all
boomers&#39; stance again. So I took a middle of the road
approach to her.</pre>
