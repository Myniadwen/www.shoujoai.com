He sat in the room before the window, and waited.

He was the head of one of the most powerful criminal organizations in 
China, perhaps even the world; the White Tiger. Both feared and 
respected by those around him, he and his family controlled the hashish 
and opium trade in most of Asia, and their power in mainland China was 
rivaled only by the Imperialists. The clan had been controlled by his 
family for generations, and no one within the family had ever questioned 
the ethics or tactics they used.

That was, until this latest generation.

Until his two granddaughters turned their backs on the family business.

The one was trained in the martial arts under several masters, and 
geared to join the family business. But then, something unexpected 
happened; she discovered she had a natural gift with song. Her voice, 
melodic and hypnotizing, could bring listeners to tears through its 
beauty. With her grandfather&#39;s permission, she&#39;d trained under the top 
vocal teachers in Asia and Europe, eventually becoming the first Chinese 
woman ever to be invited to join the Paris Opera House, immediately 
becoming famous in not just Paris, but all of Asia as well.

The other granddaughter, sickened by the actions of her family, joined a 
Buddhist Monastery as a nun in an attempt to make atonement for her 
family&#39;s actions. In a cruel twist of fate, she was murdered in the 
Monastery. The details were sketchy, but yakuza were involved, and a 
group of women who wore samurai armor.

It was a sad day when he had the wire sent out to his granddaughter 
Reika that her sister, Irene, had been murdered. He was in for a shock, 
though, when he got the wire back. She was leaving Paris by steamship. 
She had asked that she be allowed to avenge her sister&#39;s death. As 
sister, she had argued it her right and prerogative to kill those who 
had murdered Irene.

A knock on the door pulled the aged man out of his thoughts. A much 
younger man entered the room, bowing to the White Tiger Clan&#39;s elder as 
a sign of respect.

&quot;It&#39;s been quite some time, Mr. Chang.&quot; the man noted. &quot;You wished to 
see me?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Reika&#146;s coming back to us, to go to Japan and kill her sister&#39;s 
murderers.&quot;

The man quietly contemplated the news as the elder continued.

&quot;You were with her the most prior to her leaving us, Kou. From what you 
can remember, how was her fighting performance? Speak frankly.&quot;

&quot;Miss Reika was, and probably still is, too soft. She could never bring 
herself to go full-out in training sessions against sparring partners, 
for fear of hurting them. I therefore have serious doubts she would be 
able to bring herself to kill people. Right now Irene&#39;s death is fueling 
her desire for revenge, but...&quot;

&quot;It was my beloved granddaughter&#39;s wish.&#148; the old man interrupted, &#147;Even 
I could not refuse her. I didn&#39;t want to drag her into the shadow world, 
but...&quot;

&quot;I understand how you feel, sir.&quot;

The elder looked upon the other in the room sadly. &quot;I am old. You are 
the only one upon whom I can rely now.&quot;

&quot;When she arrives, I and my men will protect Miss Reika, even if it 
costs our lives.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m counting on you, Kou.&quot; the old man said, just before the young man 
left.

---Early Morning, Four days from Tokyo---

Daley slowly eased his back against the wagon wheel as he tried to find 
a comfortable position to sit in. His leg was heavily bandaged after 
being taken care of by Nigel the day before, and his back and side were 
covered with bruises from falling off his horse. Reaching into his 
pocket, he pulled out what was left of his spectacles. The frame was 
bent, and one of the lenses was missing. He could hear the others in the 
camp around him snoring, and without his glasses he could just make out 
the charred remains of Nigel&#146;s log cabin about fifty feet from the 
wagon.

As he put the damaged glasses on, Leon exited the tent he was sleeping 
in and walked into the woods. Daley watched his friend disappear into 
the foliage, and pulled out a novel he was reading. Ignoring the 
throbbing in his leg, and squinting so that he could see out of the good 
right lens, he opened to where his bookmark was and began to read.

Just as he was finishing a paragraph, a shadow fell across the page he 
was on.

&quot;McNichol, do you mind? I&#39;m trying to read this, you&#146;re in my light.&quot; he 
said. He then felt a hand land on his head, and tilt him back. He found 
himself staring into a pair of blue-gray eyes.

&quot;Stingray-san? Sorry, I thought you were...&quot;

&quot;Where is he, Wong-san?&quot;

Daley was taken aback a bit by the tone of Sylia&#39;s voice and look in her 
eyes. &quot;I take it you and Nene had a talk after the fighting. Leon&#39;s over 
there in the woods.&quot; he said, motioning with his thumb over his left 
shoulder. Sylia looked in the direction indicated, and proceeded to do 
something she hadn&#39;t done in close to a week; she straightened up to her 
full height. As Daley watched her straighten her back and walk away, he 
noted how much more imposing it made her look.

Meanwhile, Leon watched as his breath appeared before him in the cold of 
the early morning. A final shake, and he was done relieving himself. He 
buttoned up his fly, slid his suspenders up over his shoulders, and 
turned around. There, silently watching him, was Sylia. She was wearing 
her now dirty and stained poncho over what remained of her armor, her 
helmet blown to bits along with the horse and saddle it was tied to the 
day before. She appeared to be studying the British Army Captain 
intently. Leon smiled nervously.

&quot;I didn&#39;t realize I had an audience.&quot; he said rakishly. Sylia narrowed 
her eyes, causing Leon to turn self-consciously away from her stare.

&quot;You challenged Yamazaki to a duel, didn&#39;t you?&quot; she asked. Leon tried 
to look Sylia in the face as he defended himself, but found he couldn&#39;t 
take the way she was glaring at him.

&quot;I...&quot; he began, looking down at the ground, &quot;I was... tricked into 
it...&quot; he said, realizing even as the words came out just how ridiculous 
they sounded. &quot;It&#39;s for the love of a woman. Originally, all I wanted 
was her in the sack, but now&#133; Anyways, what&#146;s done is done, and I can&#146;t 
back out now. Not to a woman. You wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot;

Sylia&#39;s harsh features softened, and she felt a bittersweet melancholy 
enter her.

&quot;Captain McNichol, I understand fully why you chose to do what you did.&quot;

Leon looked at her in surprise. It was the last thing he expected to 
come out of her.

&quot;Priss is an extraordinary woman.&quot; she continued, &quot;Fierce and 
independent, she&#39;s capable of rage and savagery as well as love and 
tenderness. I can remember...&quot;she trailed off a bit, closing her eyes as 
she remembered the past. Taking a deep breath, she opened them again. 
&quot;But that was all long ago... Captain, I understand you spoke from the 
heart, but your actions have placed one of my girls in danger, to say 
nothing of the possibilities of retribution should Emperor Meiji learn 
of this. At the moment it&#146;s a private squabble, but if you&#146;re not 
careful it&#146;ll become an international incident.&#148;

&#147;I know, damn it! Don&#146;t you think I know this? I thought all I&#146;d have to 
do is threaten, and she&#146;d back down. I never expected her to actually 
accept a challenge to the death. Bloody hell, why did she have to enter 
the picture anyways? I was wearing Priss down, another week or two and 
I&#133;&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Sylia said, interrupting him, &#147;I realize your pride is hurt, and 
you wish to have Priss for yourself, but try to understand; even if 
there were no Linna, even if you were the richest man in all Japan, in 
all the world, she still wouldn&#39;t be with you.&quot;

Leon became angry at that. &quot;Let me guess,&quot; he said belligerently, &quot;She 
wouldn&#39;t want me because I&#39;m European and not Japanese, right?&quot;

Sylia suddenly looked sad, almost as if she were feeling pity for the 
Captain. &quot;No.&quot; she said, &quot;She wouldn&#39;t want you because you&#39;re a man, 
and not a woman.&quot;

Leon turned away from her. He felt a hand resting on his shoulder.

&quot;Try to understand; she only has feelings for other women. She&#39;ll never 
be able to feel for you what you feel for her.&quot;

&quot;And how do you know all this?&quot; Leon asked irritated. He heard Sylia let 
out a sigh.

&quot;Trust me, Captain McNichol. I know.&quot; she said in a low voice.

Leon turned back around to look at her. Something in the way she said it 
caught his attention. Sylia turned slowly, resting her hand on the trunk 
of a nearby oak, and started to walk away.

&quot;Wait!&quot; Leon called out. Sylia looked back over her shoulder at Captain 
McNichol.

&quot;Maybe... Well, I was told a little bit about her past when I first 
arrived in Tokyo. About her father, I mean. Apparently the bloke 
abandoned her. Maybe... Maybe that&#39;s why she has this sickness.&quot;

&quot;Sickness?&quot; Sylia asked, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;&quot;Yes, sickness. There&#39;s a term for it, you know; sapphoism. But if I 
could show her we aren&#39;t all like that old man of hers, that some of us 
are fairly decent...&quot;

&quot;And you plan to do this how? By killing the woman she loves?&quot;

Leon had no response to that. Indeed, what could he say? Sylia turned 
around again and headed back to camp, leaving Leon to brood. If he went 
through with this duel, and won, he&#146;d be killing someone that Priss was 
in love with. If he did so, she&#146;d hate him to his dying day. If he 
backed out, it would mean he&#146;d loose face, and look like a coward in 
front of others for backing down to a mere woman. Grudgingly, angrily, 
he had to admit the obvious; he was in a no-win situation, and it was 
all because he couldn&#146;t keep his fool mouth shut.

&#147;Wake up time!&#148; he heard Colonel Roland yell out from the camp, &#147;Time to 
break camp and move out.&#148;

---Afternoon---

Colonel Roland was sitting next to Daley in the wagon. As neither could 
walk very well unaided, it was decided that they would travel thus with 
the Emperor and Henderson. Henderson had currently fallen asleep, and 
both the Emperor and Daley were intently reading their respective 
novels. The Colonel, who was uncomfortable and bored out of his gourd, 
leaned over to Daley.

&#147;Hey, Wong. What you reading there?&#148; he asked. The young police officer 
looked up through his demolished lenses and smiled.

&#147;It&#146;s a gothic romance novel by a young up-and-comer, a Sumiregawa 
Nenene. For a young writer, she develops her characters remarkably well. 
When I&#146;m done, if you want&#133;&#148;

&#147;Thanks, but no. Gothic romances aren&#146;t my cup of tea.&#148;

&#147;I say, Colonel.&#148; the Emperor chimed in, &#147;You want to read something 
downright odd, you should have a look at this book I&#146;m reading.&#148;

&#147;What is it? Adventure, humor&#133;&#148;

&#147;Political theory.&#148; The Emperor answered. Roland rolled his eyes. 
&#147;Listen to this, &#145;Workers of the world unite! You have nothing to loose 
but your chains.&#146;&#148;

Both Roland and Daley gave him a blank stare. &#147;Who wrote that drivel?&#148; 
Daley asked.

&#147;Some German chap by the name of Karl&#133;&#148;

&#147;Dah.&#148;

The three men turned to the front of the wagon, where Mackie was driving 
the horses as Nene, her arm in a sling, leaned her head against her 
shoulder.

&#147;Doh?&#148; Mackie asked, attempting to repeat the word his girlfriend was 
trying to teach him.

&#147;No, &#145;dah.&#146; That&#146;s how you say &#145;yes.&#146;&#148;

&#147;&#146;Dah..&#146; Great, I&#146;ve got it.&#148; Mackie said, pleased with himself. &#147;Now, 
suppose I wanted to say &#145;no?&#146;&#148;

&#147;That would be &#145;nyehtt.&#146;&#148;

&#147;N&#133; Nye&#133;&#148;

&#147;Nene.&#148; Roland called as he made his way over to the front of the wagon, 
&#147;What in the hell do you think you&#146;re doing?&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; Nene asked, surprised by Colonel Roland&#146;s angry tone. &#147;Mackie 
was curious to learn a bit about my native land, so I was teaching him 
some Russian.&#148;

&#147;Oh, for the love of&#133; If you&#146;re going to teach him anything, teach him 
Japanese. How the hell do you expect him to function in this country 
knowing English and a handful of Russian?&#148; Roland asked exasperatedly.

Mackie looked back at the Colonel and clenched his fists as his face 
turned red.

&#147;Colonel Roland, I&#133; I don&#146;t care who you are, or how much older than me 
or Nene you are. If you&#133; If you ever talk to my girl that way again, 
I&#146;ll&#133;&#148;

&#147;Look kid, I&#133;&#148;

&#147;My name&#146;s not kid! It&#146;s Mackie.&#148;

By now everyone in the little caravan was looking at the wagon. Those 
who didn&#146;t understand English knew enough by the angry tones and body 
language to tell that a heated discussion was taking place. Sylia and 
Nigel, riding alongside one another, threw worried glances towards 
Mackie and Nene, as well as the colonel whose head was sticking out of 
the front flap.

The Colonel looked at Mackie for a few seconds, then grinned. &#147;I&#146;m 
sorry; Mackie.&#148; he said, correcting himself. &#147;I can be a bit gruff at 
times, lad. It comes from spending most of my life in the military, I 
suppose. But I&#146;m not that bad a bloke once you get to know me. My 
secretary there can vouch for that.&#148;

Nene looked down, &#147;Well, I was your secretary, but&#133;&#148;

The Colonel&#146;s smile grew wider. &#147;You still are my secretary. I&#146;ve been 
talking with the Emperor, and we both agreed that if you&#146;re going to 
continue going out nights as a mystery woman, you&#146;re going to need some 
sort of a cover. Besides, you&#146;re the best damn secretary we&#146;ve ever 
had.&#148;

Nene beamed. &#147;Thank you, Colonel.&#148; She looked over to Mackie, who put 
his hand behind his head as he nervously looked away.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, Colonel. I guess I put my foot in it that time, huh?&#148;

&#147;Nah, think nothing of it kid&#133; er, Mackie. She&#146;s your girl; you&#146;re 
supposed to stand up for her.&#148;

As everyone around the wagon saw tensions eased, they all once again 
began to focus their attentions elsewhere. Sylia noticed then that Linna 
didn&#146;t look right. She made a mental note of it, and resolved to look 
into it later.

---Evening---

Priss warily finished setting up her tent, and began to roll out her 
mat, when she heard someone at the entrance pull the flap open.

&#147;Priss-chan, where were you last night?&#148; Linna asked, concern evident in 
her voice. Normally, Priss came over to her tent at night to keep her 
company. Sometimes they talked, sometimes they made love, and sometimes 
they just lay next to one another and fell asleep in their arms. For 
Priss to have left Linna alone all night was totally out of character, 
especially given the events of the previous day.

&#147;Sleeping.&#148; she said, her back still to her partner. As she began to 
undress, Linna could see the bruises and scrapes suffered from her 
partner&#146;s fall from the horse, as well as the blood-stained bandage over 
her left shoulder. She stopped undressing and knelt down on her mat, 
putting her hand up to her forehead as she did so.

&#147;Mmm&#133; My head feels like it&#146;s in a vice.&#148; she said, fatigue and pain 
evidenced in her voice. Linna immediately knelt down behind her and 
began rubbing her love&#146;s temples.

&#147;Here, let me.&#148; she said, &#147;Here&#146;s something I learned back in the okiya 
in Kyoto, to help ease stress and&#133;&#148; she was cut off by Priss&#146; hands 
reaching up and pulling hers away.

&#147;Priss-chan?&#148; Linna asked, both confused and hurt by her lover&#146;s 
actions. Priss stood up and turned to her.

&#147;Why won&#146;t you tell me what you and Leon discussed?&#148;

Linna began to look away from her lover&#146;s gaze. &#147;I&#133; I can&#146;t. I can only 
tell you that nothing happened in the tent. I don&#146;t want there to be any 
dark clouds between us love, but&#133;&#148;

Priss closed her eyes and, taking a deep breath, asked her next 
question. &#147;Are&#133; Are you seeing Leon?&#148;

Linna was visibly shaken by the question. &#147;Priss-chan, how can you even 
ask such a thing?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not a child, Linna-chan. If there&#146;s something going on between the 
two of you&#133;&#148;

Linna&#146;s eyes began to tear up. &#147;No, Priss, no! I swear, I love you and 
only you. There is no other, certainly not McNichol!&#148;

Priss looked into her geisha&#146;s eyes, and saw the hurt she had caused. 
She wanted to believe her, to tell her she was sorry for accusing her, 
but she held back. She&#146;d been lied to before, been hurt before, by 
someone she had once loved. And now, history seemed to be repeating 
itself.

&#147;Priss, Linna, are either of you in there?&#148; a voice called out.

&#147;Speak of the devil.&#148; Priss mumbled as the front flap opened, and Sylia 
entered, looking better than she had all week. She immediately noted 
both the annoyed look in Priss eyes, as well as the tears running down 
Linna&#146;s cheeks.

&#147;&#148;Priss, would you mind leaving the tent for a moment? I need to speak 
with Linna.&#148;

Priss looked from Sylia to her lover and back, finally shaking her head. 
&#147;Heh, keeps getting better.&#148; She said acerbically.

&#147;Priss, wait.&#148; Linna said as she grabbed Priss&#146; arm. Priss slowly turned 
to her. &#147;I&#133; I can&#146;t tell you what&#146;s going on, not now. There&#146;s something 
I have to do, something you can&#146;t be any part of. When it&#146;s over though, 
I promise I&#146;ll tell you everything. In the meantime, please believe me 
when I say I love you and no one but you.&#148;

Priss looked away as Linna&#146;s voice choked out the final words. &#147;Please, 
Priss-chan. Please have faith in me.&#148;

Priss closed her eyes as the final words burned themselves into her 
psyche. She silently turned around again and left her tent. Linna wiped 
her tears away as she turned to Sylia.

&#147;You haven&#146;t told her?&#148; Sylia asked.

&#147;How could I? Sensei, we both know what her reaction would be. Besides, 
if I back down from this, I lose her.&#148;

Sylia smiled a bit. &#147;Leon won&#146;t back down because of his pride, and you 
won&#146;t back down because of your love.&#148; Linna looked away from Sylia, who 
was studying her actions. &#147;So when exactly is all this going to take 
place?&#148;

&#147;Well, provided we make it back to alive, as soon as the Emperor is 
safely back on his throne. As the one who issued the challenge, Leon has 
the choice of weapons, and&#133;&#148;

&#147;Stop right there; you gave McNichol the right to pick the weapons?&#148;

&#147;Of course. It&#146;s only right according to protocol, so&#133;&#148;

&#147;Protocol be damned! Do you have any working knowledge of European 
weapons? Have you ever handled a gun or a European sword such as a 
cutlass?&#148;

&#147;No, never. But as far as a gun goes, you just point in the direction 
you want to fire and pull a trigger. And as for a cutlass, it&#146;s just a 
long, thin sword, like a small katana or dotanuki, right?&#148;

Sylia rolled her eyes. &#147;Wrong. It&#146;s nothing like a dotanuki or katana, 
and European fencing is nothing like Japanese fencing. Good God, woman&#133;&#148;

&#147;Sensei, I know you&#146;re concerned, and for that I&#146;m grateful. But I have 
to go through with this. Don&#146;t you see?&#148;

Sylia brushed her hair back with her hand. &#147;Linna, all I&#146;m saying is&#133;&#148;

&#147;Hey you two!&#148; Both Linna and Sylia turned to the tent entrance. &#147;If 
you&#146;re both done keeping secrets from me, can I go to bed now?&#148;

Sylia turned back to Linna, &#147;We&#146;ll continue this tomorrow.&#148; she said. 
She headed out, followed by Linna. As she was passing her, Linna glanced 
over at Priss, noting sadly that her love didn&#146;t return her look as she 
went into her tent.

---Three Days from Tokyo---

Bryan J. Mason was not in a good mood.

He had yet to hear from any of his spies sent out to find the Royal 
Family, and his man Kiyoshi had been missing for the last twenty-four 
hours. While Mason was willing to be lenient with the drunk up to a 
point, he wished the former daimyo had picked a better time to 
disappear. He was planning on presenting him to the people of Tokyo as 
their new Emperor as soon as the gunship finally arrived, and that could 
happen any day now. While he had hoped to have the Royal Family 
exterminated by now, he now had to go with plan B; lure them out by 
presenting Kiyoshi, then once they come out of hiding murder them. Crude 
yes, but hopefully quite effective.

His other main concern, aside from disposing of the refugees currently 
holed up at the British Compound, was the lack of news from the men he&#146;d 
sent out to dispose of the four nuisance women and the yellow king. He&#146;d 
sent out twenty-four, and there were more coming from the opposite 
direction to head off any possibility of an escape. Still, those four 
women had somehow defeated an Iga clan hunting pack. Until he heard word 
back from them, he &#133;

Mason was pulled from his thoughts by gunfire outside. The sound of such 
gunfire was now quite common in Tokyo due to the sudden rise in rioting 
and violence the disappearance of the Emperor had precipitated. That was 
not what had Mason worried.

What worried Mason was that the gunfire was coming from the front of the 
building. Genom Munitions and Trading Company International was under 
attack.

Mason had never thought to plan for this possibility. They were Genom. 
They were the suppliers of the guns to those dirty Orientals down there. 
Had he somehow miscalculated, perhaps pushing them too far? Were those 
yellow savages now so worked up they were willing to bite the hand that 
fed them?

As he heard gunfire coming from the floor below, and became aware of 
shouting and screaming taking place within the building, he pulled a 
handgun out of a drawer in his desk and began to load it. Turning to the 
window, he nervously ventured a look outside.

There was a crowd outside, but they weren&#146;t attacking. Instead, they 
were standing a good ways away from the building across the street, 
pointing at the front of the structure and exchanging horrified glances.

&#147;What the bloody hell is happening?&#148; he murmured, only to just then be 
scared out of his wits by a knock at the door.

&#147;Mason-sama! Mason-sama, are you in there?&#148;

Mason cautiously opened the door. The hallway looked like a war zone, as 
yakuza and European security forces ran all around carrying guns and 
swords. From the stairs leading to the first floor, smoke was bellowing 
up, and the sounds of yelling and gunfire were continuing. &#147;What&#146;s 
happening? Who&#146;s attacking us?&#148;

&#147;Sir, it appears to be a single man who&#146;s&#133;&#148;

&#147;What? One man is doing all this?&#148;

&#147;Sir, we&#146;ll get the situation under control. For now, we need you to 
stay here in this room and not come out for anyone. I&#146;ll let you know 
when it&#146;s safe. Do you understand?&#148;

&#147;Yes, of course.&#148; He said as he immediately reentered his room and 
locked the door. As he did so, he felt the entire building shake from an 
explosion, and heard screaming coming from his floor. Gunfire soon 
erupted, followed by more yelling and screaming. Within a short period 
of time, the gunfire stopped. Mason was hiding behind his desk when he 
heard a knocking at his door. He didn&#146;t dare answer it, didn&#146;t dare to 
even move from his spot. He clutched the gun, and waited.

-KA-BOOM!-

Mason screamed out in fear as the door to his office exploded inward, 
crashing against the wall to his right. He stood up, gun in hand, to see 
who his attacker was.

Slowly, through the smoke, a young man dressed all in black with a scarf 
covering his face came into view. Blood was dripping from the multiple 
stab and gunshot wounds inflicted upon his body, and in his right hand 
he held a bloody sword.

&#147;Brian J. Mason.&#148; he gasped, as he limped into the room. Behind him, 
Mason could see the dead bodies of his security personnel.

&#147;H&#133; How in the hell are you still standing?&#148; Mason whimpered. The youth 
just glared at him.

&#147;We went out to do your dirty work. I and my brethren in the Iga clan. 
You didn&#146;t give us the necessary information. Because of you, my 
brethren are dead. I&#133; I will die soon too,&#148; he said, noting his many 
wounds, &#147;But not before you!&#148;

Mason brought the gun up, but a shuriken thrown by his would-be assassin 
into his shoulder caused him to drop it. The ninja rushed into the room, 
sword held overhead.

-Blam! Blam!-

Mason watched as the ninja, now missing half his face, sank to the 
ground dead. Behind him, one of his security men was holding a smoking 
revolver. As Mason removed the small dagger-like shuriken from his 
shoulder, a middle-aged man pushed past the man holding the gun and 
entered the room.

&#147;Mason, Sir! The rest of us just arrived to&#133;&#148;

&#147;Who are you?&#148; Mason asked, as he bent down to pick up his gun.

&#147;Sir, I&#146;m your chief of security here for the&#133;&#148;

Mason glared angrily at the man, brought his gun up, and fired. The man 
fell backwards, blood streaming from the gunshot wound to his forehead.

&#147;You&#146;re fired!&#148; Mason growled. Turning to the man who shot the young 
ninja, &#147;You, you&#146;re the new chief of security. What&#146;s your name?&#148;

&#147;Sir, Liam Fletcher sir.&#148;

&#147;Well Mr. Fletcher, after you and your men clean this mess up, go out 
and find me that tub of lard Kiyoshi.&#148;

&#147;S&#133; Sir, yes sir.&#148;

&#147;But first, get me a doctor.&#148;

---British Military Headquarters, Tokyo---

Major Jose Collins scratched at his chin as he left his office and 
entered the crowded corridor. After days cramped together, everyone was 
becoming edgy. The stricter rationing of food had been an unpopular 
order, but a necessary one. Private Sweager had found one or two food 
hoarders, and they&#146;d been dealt with accordingly; any breakdown of 
discipline at this point could prove deadly. A lack of both sanitation 
and proper cleaning facilities was threatening to make a bad situation 
worse through disease.

One of his men had managed to get back with news about the earlier 
incident at Genom&#146;s Tokyo headquarters. The Major didn&#146;t even bother to 
try to hide his smile. As he warily made his way to his barracks, he 
thought about the impending arrival of the gun ship, and the battle that 
was to ensue. There was no way they could win, of course. They were out 
gunned and out manned. They had no help coming, nor was there any way to 
get help. He was the captain of a sinking ship, and he knew it.

As he blew his candle out and lay back in bed, he said a silent prayer 
for those under his command, and laid his head back.

---Two Days from Tokyo---

Captain McNichol was riding his charger next to the wagon. From his 
vantage point, he watched all the members of the little band. Sylia, now 
almost fully recovered, rode tall in her saddle with Nigel Kirkland 
constantly by her side. He didn&#146;t talk much; he didn&#146;t have to. His eyes 
and facial expressions spoke volumes. He didn&#146;t have to tell Sylia how 
he felt; one could just feel it from the way he acted when near her.

Chief Toodou was constantly shifting his weight in the saddle. The out 
of shape officer looked like he&#146;d lost ten pounds since leaving Tokyo, 
and he no longer complained as much about saddle soreness. Nene and 
Mackie were looking into each other&#146;s eyes as he drove the wagon. But 
what really caught his eye was what was going on with Priss and Linna.

Of course he&#146;d noticed Linna&#146;s sad face and the fact she seemed to be 
moping around during this last stretch of the journey. He had suspected 
at first that it was due to cold feet from the upcoming duel. But now he 
figured out it was something more; Linna wasn&#146;t riding alongside Priss. 
In fact, they were riding on opposite sides of the group. He noticed, 
much to his glee, that while Linna cast several furtive glances Priss&#146; 
way, Priss never returned the longing looks. &#145;Trouble in paradise&#146; he 
thought with a grin. He guided his horse over to Priss, who was wearing 
her hakama pants and kimono top.

&#147;Konichi wa.&#148; he said, offering a smile.

Priss turned to the speaker and glared at him. &#147;What do you want?&#148;

&#147;I just thought I&#146;d say &#145;hi&#146; I guess.&#148;

&#147;Well now you have.&#148; she said, turning away from him.

&#147;Sheesh, why is it you&#146;re nice to everyone but me?&#148;

&#147;If you don&#146;t like my company, go talk with Linna.&#148;

Leon gave her a look. &#147;What the hell are you talking about? What do I 
have to say to that hairless troll?&#148;

Priss turned back to him, and narrowed her eyes. &#147;Go away.&#148; she said 
angrily.

&#147;Come on, what does she have that I don&#146;t? Has she drugged you or 
something? How can you love that?&#148; he asked, motioning toward the former 
geisha.

Priss just stared at him. If he and Linna were having some sort of a 
liaison, he was certainly doing a good job covering it up. She wasn&#146;t 
sure though if he genuinely hated her, or was simply overplaying it. One 
thing was for certain; if he was having an affair with her girl, then 
for him to now be trying to pick her up made him an even bigger bastard 
than she&#146;d already given him credit for.

&#147;Captain McNichol.&#148; Chief Toodou called over, &#147;Come over here a second, 
I need to go over some things.&#148;

Leon left Priss&#146; side to go back to the police officer, leaving the 
young woman alone with her conflicting thoughts.

---Evening---

Linna rolled her bed mat out on the ground, and tried to suppress the 
urge to cry once again. For the last three nights she&#146;d slept alone, and 
tonight would make four. Her stomach began to growl as she reached for 
her lantern; she&#146;d eaten nothing all day. As she blew out the light, she 
lay back and tried to sleep, but couldn&#146;t.

Outside the tent, Priss watched the light from the lantern go out, and 
sighed deeply. Linna had asked Priss to have faith in her, and she was 
trying. But it was hurtful that Linna apparently didn&#146;t trust her enough 
to just tell her what was going on. She could remember her own struggle 
to open herself and her heart to her beloved, and to now be closed out 
herself was upsetting to say the least. At least after this afternoon, 
she could feel fairly certain that Leon and her weren&#146;t involved. But 
until she knew exactly what was happening, and why there was the need 
for all this secrecy, she wasn&#146;t going to feel comfortable being 
intimate with her geisha.

Priss slowly turned around and walked silently away. A few seconds 
later, another figure came out holding a candle. After having had to 
relieve herself, she now wanted nothing more than to go to her sleeping 
bag and warm blankets, when she happened to hear weeping coming from the 
tent next to her. Steeling herself up, she went over to the entrance of 
the tent.

&#147;Hello?&#148; she whispered tentatively, &#147;Is everything alright?&#148;

&#147;(Sniff) N&#133; Nene-san?&#148;

Nene entered the tent, and saw Linna&#146;s sorrowful visage in the 
candlelight. Instinctually, she put the candle down and sat next to her 
fellow Knight Saber, hugging her with her good arm. She didn&#146;t know what 
was happening, or where Priss was; she didn&#146;t care. Her friend was in 
pain, that was all that mattered to her at that moment. Linna began to 
cry on her shoulder as she wrapped her own arms around the young blond. 
A half hour later, Nene lay the now sleeping woman down, left the tent 
as quietly as she could, and went to her own tent.

---One Day from Tokyo---

Sylia woke up and dressed uncharacteristically in a Japanese kimono. As 
she finished tying her obi (kimono sash), she turned around to see 
Mackie staring at her. He came closer, and sat on a nearby tree stump.

&#147;Sis, when this is all over and we&#146;re back in Tokyo, what are you 
planning to do?&#148;

Sylia tilted her head a bit as she looked at her brother. &#147;That depends; 
do you mean before or after I kill Brian J. Mason?&#148;

Her brother put his hand to his forehead. &#147;Then&#133; Then you intend on 
seeing this thing through to the end?&#148; he asked, a bit taken aback, 
&#147;Very well, then what?&#148;

&#147;Then, I will reopen the Silky Doll and wait until I and my fellow 
Knight Sabers are needed again.&#148;

Mackie met her gaze. &#147;You intend to continue this double life then? Sis, 
what has become of you? Is it the thrill of it? Are you attracted to the 
danger, or&#133;&#148;

Sylia looked annoyed, &#147;Give me some credit, Mackie. The fact is, there 
are some situations, some people and organizations, that are too much 
for either the army or the police. We do what we can to protect the 
innocent and punish the guilty.&#148;

&#147;But&#133; But Nene&#133;&#148; Mackie began. His sister quickly cut him off.

&#147;Nene is an eighteen year old woman, Mackie. No one&#146;s forcing her to 
join me and the others; she&#146;s with us of her free will.&#148;

&#147;Then&#133; I want in too.&#148; he said. His sister grinned a bit as she raised 
an eyebrow.

&#147;What? I don&#146;t think you&#146;d fit into our armor&#133;&#148; she said jokingly. Her 
brother looked at her annoyed.

&#147;No, I&#146;m serious. I can&#146;t fight, but I can be useful in other ways. 
Maybe I can be trained to help Nigel with the armor upkeep and taking 
care of the swords and other weapons you and the others use. If your 
life and Nene&#146;s are on the line, then I want to feel like I&#146;m helping to 
protect you both somehow.&#148;

Sylia took a deep breath and closed her eyes. As much as she loved her 
brother, his arrival had been quite the unexpected complication. She had 
hoped to keep him out of all this, to shelter him from her other life. 
Time and events changed all that.

&#147;Very well, once we get you into a school we&#146;ll see.&#148; she finally said 
non-committaly. She then turned around and headed back to camp.

---Tokyo---

Police officer Kenji Sasaki slowly rode down the path to the Tokyo 
checkpoint. He resented being given the assignment on the outskirts of 
the city. True, there was less chance of him being killed by any angry 
mobs out here. But his fellow officers were out there in danger. He 
belonged out there with them, not out here.

He realized the Tokyo checkpoint was an important area in need of 
guarding. And he knew the civil servants who normally guarded it had 
either been killed or run from their post, but Kenji knew that wasn&#146;t 
why he&#146;d been sent here. It was as punishment for supposed reckless 
behavior and disrespecting a superior officer. Angrily, he got off his 
horse and took his position at the post. Once at the gate, he sat down 
and leaned his head back for a nap. No one was going to be crazy enough 
to want to enter a war zone like Tokyo right now. Tipping his police cap 
down he slipped off to sleep.

&#147;So, pissed off Nozawa again?&#148; a husky male voice asked.

&#147;Snkt&#133; Yeah, you know how it is Chief. Yawn&#133; Stupid desk jockey tried 
to&#133; Chief?&#148; Officer Kenji pushed his hat up and looked at Police Chief 
Toodou. Behind him was a scruffy, dirty, smelly group of vagabonds who 
looked like they&#146;d been to hell and back. Behind them were&#133;

&#147;What the&#133; The Knight Sabers?&#148; Kenji asked, not quite believing his 
eyes. Chief Toodou smiled down at the shocked officer.

&#147;We&#146;re returning the Imperial Emperor of Japan to his throne.&#148; Toodou 
said nonchalantly, motioning with his thumb back to a wagon with another 
rather scruffy looking young man sitting next to a Knight Saber in pink 
armor with her arm in a sling. &#147;Care to join us?&#148;

---To Be Continued---

End notes- Hope it was worth the wait. Hopefully will have chapter 24 up 
between now and Sunday, and the whole blasted thing finished by next 
Friday.

For those playing at home- both officer Kenji Sasaki and Liam Fletcher 
are from the AD Police TV series.</pre>
