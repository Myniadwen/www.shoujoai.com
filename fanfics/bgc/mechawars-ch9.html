<a href="../bgc/mechawars-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;What do you mean, you told her?!&quot; Priss looked over at the calmly 
smiling Sylia in shock. The other three standing around the small 
office at the Silky Doll had similar surprised expressions on their 
faces as well.

Sylia shook her head, &quot;I didn&#39;t tell her anything she didn&#39;t already 
know.&quot;

&quot;So how badly compromised are we?&quot; Mackie asked softly.

Sylia pushed her hair back from her face wit a hand. &quot;She knows about 
me as financier, tech person, and member of the Knight Sabers. What 
she doesn&#39;t know,&quot; Sylia looked up to meet the other&#39;s eyes, &quot;is 
anything about all of you.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell her about us?&quot; Linna asked her quietly.

Sylia smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;m willing to trust my own safety to my gut, and 
to an old friendship. It doesn&#39;t seem fair to ask you to put 
yourselves at risk, too.&quot;

&quot;So what does she think?&quot; Nene asked eagerly.

&quot;She wants to help,&quot; Sylia smiled. &#39;She and her alter-ego, Iron Man,&quot; 
she thought. Somehow, Sylia hadn&#39;t been too surprised when Tony had 
told her that she was Iron Man. It made sense. She met her fellow 
Knight Sabers eyes, &quot;Now, what do you want to do?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; Mackie nodded. &quot;I remember Tony from when we were kids, she 
was a good lady. No way she&#39;d be involved with Genom,&quot; he concluded.

&quot;Pass,&quot; Priss shook her head, &quot;I want to get to know this lady, 
first.&quot;

&quot;You trust her?&quot; Nene looked at Mackie and Sylia. Both nodded, &quot;OK, I 
don&#39;t mind her knowing about me.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, I&#39;m with Priss,&quot; Linna admitted, &quot;I&#39;d like to get a feel for 
the lady, first.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Sylia smiled.

Priss looked at her and got a sinking feeling. &#39;Why do I get the 
feeling I walked right into something she planned?&#39; she thought.

&quot;What?&quot; Linna asked suspiciously.

&quot;I&#39;ve set up a party for tonight,&quot; Sylia smiled, &quot;and Tony, a few 
guests, and all of you are invited. There will be enough people that 
she won&#39;t automatically know you&#39;re Knight Sabers, and this will give 
you a chance to get to know her better.&quot;

Priss shook her head, &quot;You know us too well, Sylia.&quot; She frowned 
slightly, &quot;I may not be able to come though. Something personal has 
come up.&quot;

Sylia instantly went into her command mode. &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked, 
then somewhat more gently, &quot;Is there anything I can do to be of help?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, maybe,&quot; Priss admitted, &quot;you and Nene. Last night I met a woman 
named Natsumi Tsujimoto, and she thinks she might be my aunt.&quot;

&quot;I thought your family died in the quake,&quot; Linna looked at her in 
surprise.

&quot;So did I,&quot; Priss sighed. Softly, &quot;Nobody came to the orphanage to 
claim me, and I lost my memory of anything that happened previously.&quot;

&quot;Do you want me to check into her?&quot; Sylia asked.

&quot;Please,&quot; Priss smiled. She looked over at Nene, &quot;She said she was 
with the police, before she went private. Could you look into that for 
me?&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Nene nodded.

&quot;So what was it like, meeting her?&quot; Linna asked curiously.

Priss sighed softly, &quot;Awkward.&quot;

The meeting broke up pretty soon afterward, and they each went their 
separate ways. Priss climbed up on to her bike, and after smoothly 
sliding into traffic she went on autopilot, considering what had 
happened last night.

The two had stood there by the stage doors a moment, gazing at each 
other, then Natsumi Tsujimoto had quietly suggested that they go to a 
nearby cafe to talk. They walked over to a rear table, ordered 
coffee&#39;s, and sat there silently.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Natsumi looked up to meet Priss&#39; eyes, &quot;for not trying to 
contact you sooner.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you?&quot; Priss asked, curious to hear this stranger&#39;s answer.

Natsumi sighed softly. &quot;I&#39;ve been out of touch from my family for a 
very long time,&quot; she admitted quietly. &quot;I was the black sheep because 
of my involvement with bike gangs when I was younger, and in my 
family&#39;s eyes joining the police force wasn&#39;t enough to make up for 
it,&quot; she finished quietly.

&#39;She&#39;s a biker, too,&#39; Priss thought, looking across the table, meeting 
those very same red eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t remember anything that happened 
before the quake,&quot; Priss said to her quietly. She sipped at her 
coffee, &quot;The only reason I even knew what my name was because of my 
school id. So I&#39;m not sure...&quot;

Natsumi smiled gently, &quot;You don&#39;t know what to make of this stranger 
who says she&#39;s a relative.&quot; She finished off her coffee, standing up 
and drawing a business card from her wallet, &quot;I&#39;m living and working 
in town.&quot; She put the card on the table, hesitantly adding, &quot;I&#39;d like 
to get to know you, maybe become a real Aunt to you.&quot;

With that, she turned and was gone. A few moments later, and Priss 
heard the distinctive sound of a motorbike start up, and Natsumi drove 
by the window with a farewell wave.

Priss pulled up to her trailer and glided to a stop before going 
inside. She opened up her fridge, pulling out a can of beer, popping 
the top and taking a long pull. Her answering machine light was 
blinking, and she hit the switch to check the messages.

Sylia&#39;s cool voice came over the speaker, &quot;I did a preliminary check 
on Natsumi Tsujimoto, and her story does seem to check out so far.&quot; A 
pause, &quot;I&#39;d like to see you at the party tonight.&quot; She sounded a bit 
amused, &quot;If you like, you could even invite Natsumi.&quot;

Priss made a face, taking another drink. &quot;Sure Sylia, use guilt on 
me,&quot; she sighed. &#39;No way I&#39;d invite the mysterious Natsumi to this,&#39; 
she thought, &#39;but...&#39; Without letting herself think to hard about it, 
she pulled the business card out of her pocket and dialed.

&quot;Hello?&quot; Natsumi&#39;s voice answered quietly.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Priss said quietly, feeling nervous.

&quot;Priss, it&#39;s good to hear from you,&quot; and there was honest pleasure in 
Natsumi&#39;s voice.


Tony adjusted her dress nervously, &quot;Are you sure this looks good?&quot;

&quot;You look fine,&quot; Sylia smiled, looking decidedly butch in her ladies 
suit. There was a familiar knock on the door, and Sylia called out, 
&quot;Come in.&quot;

Mackie looked nervous, his white shirt and black pants starched and 
crisp. He smiled at Tony, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if you remember me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you, Mackie,&quot; Tony smiled, shaking her hand.

Mackie grinned, &quot;I&#39;m also one of the primary repairmen for the 
Hardsuits.&quot; The surprised look on Tony&#39;s face was priceless, and both 
Sylia and Mackie smiled.

&quot;We talked about telling you this morning,&quot; Sylia explained 
cheerfully.

&quot;Thank you for trusting me,&quot; Tony smiled back at Mackie and Sylia.

There was a soft chime, and Sylia checked her watch. &quot;The first guests 
should be arriving soon,&quot; she noted.

&quot;Right,&quot; Tony nodded nervously, &quot;I can do this.&quot;

Sylia gently took her hand as they walked, &quot;Don&#39;t be so nervous. It&#39;s 
just a few of my business associates, friends, and a Knight Saber or 
two.&quot; Softly, she added, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve faced much worse as Iron 
Man.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Tony admitted, &quot;but I&#39;m still nervous.&quot;

The door chimed, and Sylia walked over to answer it. &quot;Biko,&quot; Sylia 
smiled at the tall blue haired woman.

&quot;Hello Sylia,&quot; Biko smiled. A red head stepped up beside her, and Biko 
introduced her, &quot;This is my lover, Eiko.&quot;

&quot;Congratulations,&quot; Sylia shook both their hands. She led them both 
inside, and noticed a look of recognition pass between Biko and Tony.

&quot;Hello, cousin,&quot; Biko nodded to Tony.

&quot;Good to see you,&quot; Tony shook her hand with a smile. She tilted her 
head to the side, &quot;You two are lovers?&quot;

Eiko blushed a bit, &quot;She&#39;s a little blunt about it, but yes.&quot;

The door chimed, and Mackie got it this time. &quot;Hi, Nene,&quot; he smiled.

&quot;Excuse us,&quot; Sylia smiled, taking Tony&#39;s arm and leading her over to 
Nene.

&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Nene,&quot; she smiled, shaking Tony&#39;s hand, and quietly so they 
wouldn&#39;t be overheard she added, &quot;and I&#39;m also the pink Knight Saber.&quot;

Tony grinned, &quot;Maybe Sylia and I can upgrade your suit.&quot;

Nene got big hearts in her eyes, &quot;Could you?!&quot;

Sylia laughed softly at Tony&#39;s surprised expression. &quot;Nene really 
loves high technology,&quot; she explained.

Nene walked over to introduce herself to Eiko and Biko, being careful 
not to let on that she had met them before. &#39;Of course, I was in my 
hardsuit at the time,&#39; Nene grinned.

Another new arrival, and Tony got the door next. &quot;Hi,&quot; Linna smiled at 
her, &quot;I&#39;m Linna. And you&#39;re Sylia&#39;s friend Tony, right?&quot; Linna hoped 
she looked good, dressed in one of her better stockbroker business 
suits.

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Tony smiled, &quot;Nene, Sylia and Mackie are over 
there, and a few of the other guests have arrived.&quot;

They talked quietly for a few moments, and Linna quickly came to see 
why Sylia liked her. She was calm, cool, and kind, Tony&#39;s eyes showing 
honest interest in Linna, but especially focusing on whatever Sylia 
said to her.

Sylia went to get the door next, and was pleasantly surprised to see 
the distinguished older woman standing there. She had sent her an 
invitation, but hadn&#39;t really expected an answer. &quot;Good evening, 
Akiko, it&#39;s good to see you,&quot; Sylia smiled.

&quot;Thank you for the invitation,&quot; Akiko pushed her short brown hair out 
of her eyes. It had a bit of gray, but other than that the business 
woman looked fit and attractive. She looked into the room, and her 
eyes widened in surprise, &quot;Nene?&quot;

Sylia raised her eyebrow, &quot;You know her?&quot;

&quot;Long story,&quot; Akiko smiled, &quot;involving my sort of adopted daughter 
Nuku Nuku.&quot;

Nene looked up, seeing Sylia talking to someone. &#39;What&#39;s Akiko doing 
here?&#39; Nene blinked. Akiko moved her way through the groups smiling 
and nodding, eventually reaching Nene&#39;s side. &quot;Hi,&quot; Nene said with a 
smile.

&quot;Fancy meeting you here,&quot; Akiko chuckled softly.

Linna heard the door ring and moved to open it, bumping into Tony. 
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she smiled, then reached over to pull the door open. &quot;Hey, 
Priss,&quot; Linna grinned.

Priss wore a black leather jacket and black pants, a snow white shirt 
on underneath. It looked sort of formal, but still fit Priss&#39; style. 
&quot;Hey, Linna,&quot; Priss imitated her tone perfectly. She looked over at 
the woman beside Linna and smiled slightly, &quot;You&#39;re Tony, right?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Tony nodded.

Priss shook her hand in a firm grip before leaning forward to say, 
&quot;Sylia is a good friend of mine. You hurt her, you answer to me.&quot;

&quot;Priss!&quot; Linna looked at her in surprise.

Tony&#39;s glance was respectful as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll try my best not to, I 
give you my word.&quot;
