<pre>In dedication to David, without you how would I manage to smile 
everyday? You gave me strength when I had none, and you never gave up on 
me. Thank you so much sweetie, I can&#39;t wait for a hug. 

Note: Takes place after the series, just so you know. A bit on the dark 
side, but seems reasonable in retrospect. 

 

Linna Yamazaki sat with her back to the wall, the smooth yet cold tile 
made her body ache just enough to register to her senses, she had been 
like this for days and the alcohol in her system wasn&#39;t helping her get 
over the odd feels in anyway. Reaching out with a trembling hand the 
shorthaired brunette drew a half empty bottle of vodka up to her pale 
pink lips and took a deep swig from the glass container, somehow the 
warmth of the buzz seemed to draw what little heat that was left in her 
body out; Linna gave a small shiver and chuckled darkly into the dim 
bathroom. 

&quot;Now I know what it feels like to be Sylia,&quot; she muttered despondently 
to no one, the sound of her own voice reverberated in the tiny room 
making her words pound into her own ears cruelly. There was no reason to 
feel like she did, everything was wonderful, everyone was happy and 
safe, everyone had someone to share that well earned joy with; everyone 
except her. Her pale face was already sore and raw from the hours of 
nonstop crying she had managed to do in the last few days, it happened 
at random intervals without reason or any form of a catalyst to get it 
started, she just found herself sobbing uncontrollably throughout the 
day and at night it only got worst and happened more often. &quot;I hate you, 
I hate you,&quot; furiously hissed the dark haired woman as she raised her 
eye level to meet that of the mirror, her gaze narrowed at the sight of 
her body slumped firmly against the wall with a large bottle of booze 
gripped tightly in her right hand, Linna gritted her teeth together and 
threw the glass container towards the reflective surface; missing her 
mark horribly. The shards skidded violently against the floor, embedding 
themselves deeply into her bare legs, the glass burned as it dug itself 
under her skin; somehow it eased her inner pain for just a few seconds. 

The metallic roar of the motorcycle&#39;s pipes died as Priss came to a stop 
and cut the engine, her face was slick with sweat as she pulled off her 
thick padded helmet, her clear brown eyes slowly surveyed the 
surrounding area apprehensively. Priss hadn&#39;t heard from Linna in almost 
two weeks, she knew it was stupid but somehow she couldn&#39;t help having a 
tight feeling of dread in her chest, everything was safe now there were 
no more rogue boomers or fights, there was nothing that could possible 
put Linna in any harm but still she had to go and check up on her 
friend, just to ease her own mind. Stiffening against the crisp night 
air the lithe framed, singer slowly headed towards Linna&#39;s apartment, 
she hadn&#39;t even taken a good step onto the first rung before she felt a 
stab at her gut; something was wrong. 

Priss slowly climbed the each flight of steps hesitantly, she was trying 
to push the though of impending doom out of her head, it was ridiculous 
to think something happened to her capable friend, Linna could handle 
herself but still there was that looming intuition that told her 
something was up. Quickening her pace the tall brunette leaped up steps 
two at a time, cutting the time in half as she finally reached the front 
door to Linna&#39;s apartment.

&quot;Just knock you moron,&quot; Priss chided herself in a low voice, shaking her 
head the tough looking singer tapped on the door with the back of her 
hand, letting her knuckles clack on the wood loudly, there was no answer 
just the howl of the wind ripping through the buildings&#39; alleyways; 
Priss growled angrily feeling stupid for even being there at such a late 
hour, Linna was probably asleep or something. 

She hadn&#39;t heard the knock at the front door; even if she did she could 
have cared less, Linna dragged a long sharp piece of glass across her 
legs again and again, her hands quivered weakly as she gripped the 
makeshift blade tightly causing blood to drip down hand and lightly 
splatter against the once clean floor. 

&quot;I fucking hate you! I hate you, I hate you,&quot; Linna screamed viciously 
as she locked eyes on the mirror again, the sight that greeted her 
bloodshot hues was one that made her sneer venomously and scramble to 
her feet, her fist slammed against the reflective glass shattering it 
devastatingly, splinters of glimmering particles crashing to the floor 
loudly. &quot;Don&#39;t look at me, don&#39;t you fucking look at me,&quot; her voice 
cracked piercingly into the darkness as she slumped to her knees 
cradling her head between her bloodied hands. 

Priss&#39; heart sunk into the bottoms of her feet, her fist struck the door 
harder in effort to get the woman on the other side to open up, stepping 
back the tall brunette kicked forward her boot connecting with the 
wooden barrier; the door swung open violently with the kick, knocking 
into the wall behind it hard enough to dent and chip paint. Priss rushed 
into the apartment blindly, the residence wasn&#39;t very large; there were 
only four rooms: the living room, the kitchen, the bedroom and the 
bathroom. Priss flew to each area, all where clear expect the bathroom, 
Linna had to be in there. Snapping her hand out the lithe framed singer 
grabbed at the handle, the knob refused to open no matter how hard she 
jangled it. 

&quot;Linna, open up! It&#39;s me Priss, open the damn door,&quot; Priss yelled with 
panic clutching onto every word she spoke, she couldn&#39;t hear any sign of 
movement behind the door, bracing herself for the blow the leather clad 
brunette rammed her shoulder against the entrance, no go, Priss smashed 
into it again, she could hear the wood splintering around the joints. 
Holding her breath she jammed against it once more splitting the wood at 
the edge, pulling the broken door away Priss stepped into the bathroom 
her face contorting in disbelief and horror. 

Blood and glass littered the floor and the pungent smell of alcohol 
filled the air, against the far wall Linna Yamazaki shivered violently 
and held her knees firmly against her chest crying uncontrollably. Priss 
didn&#39;t want to believe what she was seeing, her best friend covered in 
crimson liquid looking like a ghost of her former self, pulling herself 
together the dark haired brunette rushed over to the wounded woman. 
Wrapping her arms around Linna tightly Priss pulled the girl into a firm 
embrace, she didn&#39;t know what to do, she was too confused to think 
straight. 

&quot;Go away, I don&#39;t need you,&quot; Linna&#39;s voice was a broken whisper as she 
weakly muttered; her tone was flat and void of all emotions, Priss 
pulled back from the shorthaired woman not fully grasping what she had 
just said.

&quot;What? Linna you don&#39;t know what you are saying, we have to get you some 
help,&quot; her voice wavered with tension, normally Priss could handle 
anything but this wasn&#39;t right, it wasn&#39;t right at all.

&quot;Don&#39;t fucking touch me, you aren&#39;t supposed to be here, get out of my 
house! Get the hell out of my house, I don&#39;t need you,&quot; Linna was in 
hysterics, her words jutted incoherently as she screamed even though she 
couldn&#39;t even lift her head from Priss&#39; chest. 

Priss stiffened as she lifted Linna from the floor, she didn&#39;t feel 
nearly as heavy as she normally did, tears were starting to sting the 
corners of her eyes as she carried her friend out of the small bathroom 
and towards her bed, she needed to call for an ambulance but first she 
needed to lay Linna down somewhere safe. Her fingers fumbled for the 
right buttons as she mashed at the phone, everything was blurring 
together as a plethora of emotions claimed hold of her body, she was 
mostly confused but she also was angry, angry that Linna would do 
something like this to herself.

The people on the phone said the ambulance would be there in a few 
minutes but Priss hadn&#39;t heard anything they said she was too busy 
watching Linna sob on the bed, she knew they would come and that was 
good enough she just wanted to get back to Linna and make sure she 
didn&#39;t hurt herself anymore. 

&quot;Why the &#151;Linna why, tell me why the hell you did this,&quot; snapped the 
tall brunette, her voice sounded too harsh and she winced as soon as it 
left her mouth, Linna just rolled over and garbled something 
unintelligibly as she looked at Priss with pained eyes. &quot;Why did you do 
it?&quot;

&quot;Happiness made me do it,&quot; hissed Linna furiously her tone dark and low 
as she managed to make her self understandable, Priss just looked at the 
shorthaired brunette with confusion making her brow furrow. &quot;Everyone is 
happy, everyone is happy, they don&#39;t need me, alone, I&#39;m alone, unhappy. 
Only one that isn&#39;t happy, no longer needed, useless,&quot; she rambled as 
her eyes fluttered closed, Priss&#39; heart sank and a knot formed at the 
pit of her stomach. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you fucking die on me, we have fought boomers and avoided an 
apocalypse. You are not gonna die on me now, not over this stupid shit, 
not over something that isn&#39;t true!&quot;

&quot;Not true!? You&#39;re a liar, a fucking liar! You don&#39;t care about me, you 
don&#39;t have to care about me you have him,&quot; Linna spat the word &#39;him&#39; out 
like it was poison, Priss felt a stab at her heart, she had been 
ignoring Linna ever since they all made it back to Tokyo safely, 
ignoring her to spend time with Leon, a guy she didn&#39;t even like all 
that much. It was her fault that the shorter woman had done this to 
herself. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Linna. God, just don&#39;t die, I promise to make it up to you. 
I didn&#39;t mean to make you feel like this, you should have told me, I&#39;m 
sorry,&quot; Priss&#39; words made Linna flinch visibly and cower away from the 
woman as she crawled onto the bed moving towards the smaller female.

&quot;Don&#39;t touch me, please don&#39;t touch me.&quot;

&quot;Why not,&quot; anger was rising in Priss&#39; tone, as she demanded to know why 
she couldn&#39;t hold her friend, Linna jerked her hand away as the 
lithe-framed singer reached for it in effort to pull her close. 

&quot;Because you make me hurt all over, you make me want to cut the pain 
out, goddamn you,&quot; Linna curled into a tight ball on her side and 
whimpered pitifully, Priss felt cold all over, the words had chilled her 
to the very marrow of her bones. Reaching out Priss grabbed Linna&#39;s arms 
and pulled her close, she wasn&#39;t crying but the urge to wasn&#39;t leaving 
either. 

&quot;Linna&#151;&quot; the leather clad brunette spoke in a low tone but was 
interrupted as the pale woman in her arms silenced her by whispering out 
inaudibly with pain in her shallow voice. 

&quot;I love you, Priss.&quot;

Those were the last words the tough looking singer had expected to hear, 
Priss just blinked trying to ease the shock, but found herself getting 
more and more confused. Priss didn&#39;t remember exactly when the 
paramedics arrived but she knew that they had taken Linna with them, all 
she could do was close her eyes and cry.

 

The End

 

Author&#39;s Note: Well, this really wasn&#39;t the end but I just haven&#39;t had 
the go to power to do anything. If I get good reviews then maybe I will 
keep going, I hope you all liked the story it was really a chapter from 
my life, more or less. Bubblegum Crisis has always been one of my 
favourite animes, and it is the first anime in which I have bought the 
entire series, so for some reason I will always have a certain 
affixation towards it. In any case I hope you all enjoyed the story. 
Thank you all.
