<h1>A Goddess Comes to Call (part 9 of 21)</h1>

<a href="../bgc/godcall-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;Banpei was activated last night.&quot; Skuld said frowning, looking down 
at a small remote control she held in her hand. Mackie and Nene 
watched in surprise as the young Goddess suddenly jumped up from where 
she was sitting on the couch and raced down the hall towards Linna and 
Belldandy&#39;s room.

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Nene cautioned, getting up from her own chair to race 
after her. She had a good idea what Skuld might burst in on, and 
didn&#39;t want to see what might happen!

&quot;Hey, they might not want to be disturbed!&quot; Mackie added, and Nene 
winced.

&quot;Could you be a little less tactful, Mackie?&quot; Nene asked him with 
great sarcasm. Skuld hurried faster, if that was possible.

&quot;What in the..&quot; Priss said surprised as Skuld raced by her, Nene and 
Mackie in hot persuit. With a shrug, she joined the chase.

Skuld came to a screeching halt at Linna and Belldandy&#39;s room, then 
pressed her ear to the door. When she didn&#39;t hear anything, she 
whipped out a small device, put a set of headphones on and pointed it 
at the bedroom! &quot;Hmm, no movement!&quot; she said thoughtfully.

&quot;Maybe we should just leave them alone,&quot; Nene said nervously, taking 
Skuld&#39;s arm and trying to gently pull the young goddess down the hall. 
Sadly, she couldn&#39;t manage to get Skuld to budge an inch.

Instead, Skuld stepped forward and whipped the door open! Looking 
inside, they saw Linna and Belldandy, fast asleep and nude on top of 
the rumpled covers, spooned together. Linna had her arms wrapped 
around Belldandy posessively, as is she never intended to let her go.

&quot;Way to go, Linna!&quot; Priss said quietly, a slightly sad smile on her 
face. &#39;It wasn&#39;t that she was jealous, it was just that, well, 
alright, she was jealous,&#39; Priss admitted to herself. She snuck 
another look at the two sleeping women while she still had the chance.

Nene looked over at the plainly furious Skuld and began to softly 
count down under her breath, &quot;Five... four... three... two... one...,&quot; 
then she put her hands over her ears.

&quot;Big sister, how could you!&quot; Skuld shouted loudly, instantly awakening 
the two young women sleeping there! Linna saw the group staring in the 
open doorway and quickly scrambled around the room for her clothes as 
Belldandy looked on serenely. Priss just stood there and grinned, 
while Nene reached over to cover poor Mackie&#39;s eyes with her hand.

&quot;You really should knock first,&quot; Belldandy gently chided Skuld, as 
Linna sat down on the side of the bed and struggled to pull on her 
pants, a half on/ half off T-shirt covering her top.

Urd stuck her head out of her own room just down the hall and sourly 
asked the group &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; She then sauntered out of her room 
in a very revealing nightgown, which Priss definitely noticed. It was 
a scanty two piece that fought a valiant battle just to try to contain 
Urd&#39;s many charms. She grinned at the slightly stunned look on Priss&#39; 
face, and struck a glamour-girl pose, &quot;You like?&quot;

Priss blushed, suddenly discomforted, and stuttered out &quot;I.. uhm... it 
looks good.&quot;

Urd smiled at her, then moved forward to look into the other bedroom. 
&quot;Did you two have a good time last night?&quot; she asked Linna and 
Belldandy pleasantly.

Linna blushed brighter, while Belldandy just smiled a very self- 
satisfied smile. &quot;You knew,&quot; Skuld exclaimed, &quot;and you didn&#39;t stop 
them?!&quot;

&quot;Why should I?&quot; Urd said with a casual shrug. &quot;It certainly sounded 
like they were both having fun last night,&quot; she said with a impish 
smile on her face. Both Linna and Belldandy blushed a bit more at 
that. Before any more teasing could occur, Lina took the door in her 
hand and firmly closed it in their faces.

A fiercely blushing Nene led a slightly nose-bleeding Mackie and the 
still fuming Skuld away, while Urd and Priss walked over to Urd&#39;s room 
together. &quot;Well, that was fun,&quot; Urd said with a little smile, standing 
in her open doorway. The light came from behind her, tracing her 
figure for Priss&#39; admiring gaze.

Priss grinned back at her, &quot;Did you notice the ink on her forehead?&quot; 
Urd smirked and nodded, and they both shared a cheerful laugh. &quot;Looks 
like the robot tried it&#39;s best, anyway.&quot;

&quot;No mere robot could stand in the way of true love,&quot; Urd said with a 
smile. She suddenly looked a bit nervous as she said much more softly, 
&quot;Speaking of love, I&#39;m sorry for bolting on you, last night.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve always had terrible luck and bad timing,&quot; Priss said with a 
smile and shrug. &quot;Would you like to talk about it, maybe over dinner?&quot; 
she suggested to Urd a bit nervously.

Urd looked over at Priss thoughtfully, a little smile on her face. 
&quot;Why, Priss, are you asking me out?&quot; she asked teasingly.

&quot;Yeah, I guess I am,&quot; Priss answered more firmly. &quot;I&#39;ll pick you up at 
seven o&#39;clock tonight, alright?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be ready,&quot; Urd said with a heart-stopping smile on her beautiful 
face.

Priss stopped in the hall and asked, &quot;Could you wear that dress you 
had on when I first met you?&quot; Urd gave her an enquiring glance, and a 
blushing Priss said quietly, &quot;I couldn&#39;t get how you looked in it out 
of my head for days.&quot;

Urd laughed happily, &quot;That was the general idea.&quot; She closed the door 
behind her without answering Priss&#39; question, though.

In her office, Sylia sat behind her desk and shuffled the paperwork 
spread out across it. She hated, absolutely hated, doing filing. &#39;I 
wonder if I could hire a secretary?&#39; she mused, then shook her head. 
She looked over at the clock and smiled a small, mysterious smile. 
Picking up a small folder, she said aloud, &quot;I was wondering when you&#39;d 
get here.&quot;

&quot;You really should have Belldandy and the others set up supernatural 
defences for this place,&quot; Mara said to Sylia in conversational tones, 
walking out of the shadows.

&quot;They already have,&quot; Sylia answered, &quot;but I didn&#39;t want to activate 
them until we had the chance to talk.&quot;

&quot;Oh really,&quot; Mara said, &quot;talk about what?&quot;

Sylia smiled over at Mara as she said, &quot;I&quot;d like to make a deal...&quot;



Mara looked at the pile of pages of legalese she had just spent over 
an hour to plow through, a large sweatdrop on the side of her head. 
&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; she admitted, casually fanning herself with the 
sheets of paper.

&quot;So, do we have a agreement?&quot; Sylia asked her cautiously. She had 
carefully thought out and written the request, and hopefully filled in 
any loopholes, but she wouldn&#39;t know until Mara sent the wish in.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Mara said, shaking her head with an admiring smile. &quot;The way 
you wrote this,&quot; she continued, holding up the contract, &quot;my side 
would gain absolutely nothing from such a wish, other than your soul.&quot;

&quot;That was the intent,&quot; Sylia admitted. &quot;I think my soul would have 
been a small price to pay if you could have done it, though.&quot;

&quot;A completely unselfish wish,&quot; Mara said with a smile, &quot;not something 
we see every day.&quot; Mara waved the massive contract around and asked, 
&quot;Could I take this with me?&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Sylia asked her suspiciously.

&quot;I want to fax it to our contracts department, with a note attatched 
reading, &#39;Learn, guys.&#39;,&quot; Mara said with a grin.

Both she and Sylia shared a short laugh at that. &quot;Speaking as one 
professional to another,&quot; Sylia said calmly, a little smile teasing 
her lips &quot;I hope I didn&#39;t injure you, up on the construction site.&quot;

&quot;Nothing permanent,&quot; Mara said with a smile. &quot;And, as one professional 
to another,&quot; Mara said more seriously, &quot;I won&#39;t be holding back in our 
next engagement.&quot;

They both looked at each other dead seriously, then suddenly the whole 
conversation struck them both as funny. Sylia smiled, Mara chuckled, 
then they both began laughing until they needed to lean on each other 
for support. They would calm down momentarily, then look at each other 
and start laughing again.

Sylia dug around her desk until she found a box off tissues and pulled 
out some for her and Mara. &quot;You certainly dress well for a devil,&quot; 
Sylia tried to change the subject, looking over Mara thoughtfully.

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Mara answered with a smile. She looked Sylia over 
thoughtfully, adding &quot;There were a few outfit&#39;s downstairs I was 
tempted by. I&#39;ll stop in when I&#39;m off duty.&quot; With that, she was gone.

Sylia looked thoughtfully to where Mara was standing, wondering a bit 
at the look Mara had given her before she left. As if she was 
considering something else...
