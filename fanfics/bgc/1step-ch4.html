<h1>One Step at a Time (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/1step-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Priss was finally pulling into the driveway she&#39;d cleared away in front 
of her trailer. Leon had been giving her grief about riding home on her 
bike one handed from the Silky Doll, but luckily that would all be over 
in two days when her arm would finally be removed from its cast.

The day after tomorrow also marked the much-hyped return of Sekiria to 
Hot Legs. Priss&#39; arm couldn&#39;t heal fast enough for owner Tony Ishimura. 
After such replacement acts as The Bloody Blood, Darwin and the 
Degenerates, and an alternative garage band simply called Spinach failed 
to generate any interest, Tony had begged Priss and Sekiria to come back 
early. He was quick to point out that she was a singer, not a guitarist. 
She could just stand there and sing.

Priss had thought about it, but in the end flatly rejected the idea. She 
had an image to keep up, and she didn&#39;t want that image to be tarnished 
in the minds of her fans. Besides, with all the leaping about on stage 
she did during her performances, she knew she wouldn&#39;t be able to do the 
show she wanted to until her cast was off.

As she opened the door to her trailer and walked to her couch, her mind 
wandered back to earlier that night, and she began to laugh softly to 
herself. She still wasn&#39;t sure what was funnier; seeing Sylia say hello 
to that stupid stuffed weasel of Nene&#39;s, or hearing about Leon sticking 
his foot in a bucket of dirty mop water (and at the beginning of his 
shift no less).

As she got up to get herself a beer out of the fridge, she remembered 
Sylia calling for Linna to stay behind when everyone else was leaving. 
&#145;I wonder what she wanted Linna for?&#39; she thought as she popped the can 
open, taking a swig as she sat down in front of her television set.

------

Sylia held Linna close as the younger woman breathed softly against her 
neck. She closed her eyes, almost as if she were afraid this was all a 
dream and would disappear if she opened them. She&#39;d kissed her without 
thinking about it, without even stopping to consider whether or not 
Linna was into girls. It could have, should have blown up in her face. 
Linna should have pushed her away; she should have looked at her with a 
horrified gaze just before she ran away from her.

Instead, the younger woman kissed her back. Opening her eyes, she looked 
down at her, still resting her head on her shoulder. &quot;Linna,&quot; she 
whispered.

The office lady looked up into Sylia&#39;s face, &quot;Yes,&quot; she answered 
breathlessly.

Sylia smiled, &quot;You know,&quot; she said as she lightly traced Linna&#39;s lips 
with her index finger, &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do that for a while now.&quot; The 
younger woman pursed her lips and kissed the other&#39;s finger.

&quot;So have I,&quot; she admitted. She then thought of what this might mean to 
their relationship, as well as their relationship with the others, 
&quot;Sylia, where do we go from here?&quot;

Sylia thought about the question. They&#39;d progressed from a working 
relationship in the beginning to friends over time, but what they were 
entering into now was entirely new. Obviously, any romance among two of 
the Knight Sabers would change the group dynamic, but for her as the 
leader of the group to begin dating someone under her opened up a whole 
Pandora&#39;s Box of complications. Could she send Linna into danger if they 
went any further? And how would Priss and Nene take such a development? 
Would they be accepting, complain that she gave Linna preferential 
treatment, or even be intolerant of their entering into a lesbian 
relationship?

She was pulled out of her thoughts as she looked into the younger 
woman&#39;s eyes. Funny, she&#39;d never noticed what a deep shade of blue they 
were before, or how they glittered in the artificial lighting of the 
room they were in. As she continued to look into Linna&#39;s eyes, she knew 
what her answer was.

&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; she said finally as she tilted Linna&#39;s chin up, &quot;Just as 
long as we arrive there together,&quot; she added as she once again brought 
her lips to the other Knight Saber&#39;s. There was more passion in the kiss 
this time, less fear or nervousness. Linna&#39;s heart fluttered as she felt 
Sylia&#39;s tongue against her own, and she put her hand behind her leader&#39;s 
head as Sylia allowed a low moan to escape her throat.

As their lips separated, Sylia brought her mouth up to Linna&#39;s ear. 
&quot;Stay,&quot; she whispered, tenderly kissing her earlobe, &quot;Stay with me 
tonight. Please.&quot;

Linna opened her mouth to say something, but stopped. She looked away 
from the other woman as she sighed, &quot;I... I can&#39;t,&quot; she answered back 
sadly, &quot;I hate to say this, but I have to go home tonight. I have a ton 
of paperwork to do before I go to work tomorrow.&quot;

Sylia frowned, &quot;Couldn&#39;t you maybe call in?&quot; she asked hopefully.

Linna shook her head, &quot;I want to Sylia. More than you&#39;ll ever know. But 
I&#39;ve used up an entire year&#39;s worth of sick leave and personal days over 
the past few weeks.&quot;

Sylia&#39;s mind again raced back to all the times Linna had been there for 
her during her recovery. It had never occurred to her that it might&#39;ve 
caused Linna trouble at her job to do so. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. You&#39;re right,&quot; she 
sighed disappointedly. She then smiled seductively as she said in a 
lower voice, &quot;But tomorrow&#39;s a Friday. You have the weekends off...&quot;

&quot;Then it&#39;s a date,&quot; Linna said. She reluctantly stepped back, releasing 
Sylia from her embrace. Sylia took her hand as she walked her towards 
the front doors of the Silky Doll. As they reached the exit, she began 
to chuckle.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Linna asked.

&quot;Nene was actually right about something.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Remember about a year ago, when I teased her by leaning so close to her 
she freaked out?&quot; Sylia asked with a mischievous gleam in her eyes, &quot;She 
said she wasn&#39;t into girls like that, but thought you were.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; Linna answered as she thought back to the scene. She then 
began to giggle, asking, &quot;So how are you and your new addiction 
councilor Uprio-Chan getting along?&quot;

That sent them both into a laughing fit.

&quot;How in the hell...,&quot; Sylia asked, gasping for air as she wiped the 
tears of laughter from her eyes, &quot;...did you survive being stuck on an 
island with her for two weeks?&quot;

&quot;He, he... it wasn&#39;t easy,&quot; Linna answered, &quot;If that Norwegian fishing 
boat hadn&#39;t showed up when it did, I was going to go &#145;Lord of the Flies&#39; 
on her! Did I ever tell you how she tried to make a pet out of one of 
the clams we found off shore?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re kidding! Ha, ha, what happened?&quot;

&quot;She changed her mind when the stupid thing clamped down on her finger. 
You should&#39;ve seen it... Ha, ha... &#145;Ow! Bad clam! Bad clam!&#39;&quot;

They both laughed hard at that. Finally, they both calmed down as they 
realized Linna had to leave. Sylia pulled the younger woman&#39;s hand up to 
her lips, kissing the back of it tenderly before leaning forward to 
lightly kiss her goodbye on the lips. Linna gave her leader&#39;s hand a 
gentle squeeze, turned around and left the building. Sylia watched as 
she got on her moped and rode away. She then locked the door, turned off 
the lights, and headed for bed.

------

Nene and Mackie were coming back from their walk around the block. They 
were holding hands, looking up at the night sky and talking about 
nothing in particular. Finding a bench they sat down together, the moon 
shining down on the pair as Mackie turned to his girlfriend.

&quot;Thank you for coming over tonight,&quot; he said, &quot;It meant a lot to sis.&quot;

Nene looked downward, &quot;Yeah, well, I&#39;m sorry I stayed away so long,&quot; she 
said. Looking up, her eyes met his, &quot;How&#39;s she doing anyways?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; he answered, &quot;She has her good days and her bad. She can still 
be cranky at times, but that&#39;s sis.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that the truth,&quot; Nene quipped. Mackie chuckled a bit at that. 
Looking at his watch, he frowned.

&quot;It&#39;s getting late,&quot; he said, &quot;We should probably head back.&quot;

Getting up from the bench, the two slowly walking back to the Silky 
Doll. Coming around the curb on the sidewalk, they saw the door open, 
and watched as Linna left the building. They then watched Sylia lock the 
door and turned off the lights.

&quot;Uh, Mackie?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve got a spare key to get in.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not really what I was going to ask. Do you know what Sylia 
needed Linna for?&quot;

&quot;Beats me,&quot; he answered with a shrug, &quot;Anyways, I&#39;d better turn in 
before my sister notices I&#39;m gone and starts looking,&quot; with that he went 
up and unlocked the door, gently kissed the blonde goodbye, and went 
inside. Nene smiled to herself as she touched her lips where he&#39;d kissed 
her. She then turned around, got on her scooter, and rode off.

---The Next Day---

Priss was using a drumstick to try to reach an itch underneath the cast 
on her right arm as she stood on the stage with Sekiria. The band had 
been practicing a new opening song Priss had picked out for tomorrow. 
Thrilled to be finally getting her damn cast off tomorrow, she wanted a 
song of triumph to announce Sekiria&#39;s return to the stage, and had 
decided on a song she&#39;d been a fan of since her teen years. While Priss 
didn&#39;t normally like doing cover songs, she couldn&#39;t resist this one; 
she even had Nene find a site on the internet that had a Japanese 
translation of the lyrics.

Unfortunately, she and the rest of the band were running into problems 
due to the fact that the song was originally in English. In order for 
Priss to get the Japanese version of the lyrics to fit the beat, she 
found herself having to sing some of the lyrics faster than she was 
normally comfortable with, and after an hour and a half of tripping over 
lyrics and messing up on the tempo both she and her band mates were 
getting frustrated.

&quot;Okay guys,&quot; she said as she swept some of her hair back away from her 
eyes and passed the stick back to her drummer, &quot;We&#39;re finally getting 
there. Let&#39;s just try it one more time.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; the drummer sighed as the guitarist began playing the beginning 
power cords. Priss grabbed the mike with her good hand, tapping her foot 
on the stage floor and silently counting the beats in time with the bass 
to make sure she had the rhythm right. Finally she jumped in, singing 
out the lyrics like a woman possessed.

&quot;Back in black,

I hit the sack,

I bet you know I&#39;m glad to be back,

Yes, I&#39;m let loose,

From the noose,

That&#39;s kept me hanging about...&quot;

------

&quot;Uh, miss... are you sure this isn&#39;t too revealing?&quot; the woman asked, at 
first trying to pull the dress down in order to cover more of her legs, 
but very quickly stopping when she realized she was pulling the top down 
with it.

&quot;Oh my!&quot; Sylia said, smiling as she brought her hands together, &quot;It 
looks wonderful on you! The red really brings out and contrasts nicely 
with the color of your hair. You simply must buy it! You owe it to 
yourself, as well as that special someone in your life,&quot; she added with 
a wink.

&quot;Really, well... mind if I try on one of the others I was looking at?&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; she answered, &quot;You know where the changing room is. But 
I&#39;m telling you; you&#39;re going to want that red dress.&quot;

Sylia&#39;s cell phone suddenly rang. She waited until her customer was in 
the changing room, and answered, &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Hello Sylia,&quot; the familiar voice said on the other line. Sylia smiled 
fondly as a warm feeling welled up within her. Her face then took on a 
mischievous look.

&quot;Hey lover,&quot; she teased playfully, hearing Linna giggle like a giddy 
school girl on the other end of the line.

&quot;Sylia,&quot; Linna said exasperatedly, &quot;I&#39;m at work, remember?&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she answered, &quot;Old habits die hard. Are we still on for 
tonight?&quot;

&quot;Of course we are,&quot; the younger woman answered reassuringly. After a few 
seconds, she said in a lower voice, &quot;I miss you.&quot;

&quot;I miss you too,&quot; Sylia answered affectionately. She frowned when she 
heard a sound coming from the dressing room, &quot;Linna, I can&#39;t talk long. 
I&#39;ve got a customer right now, but how does nine o&#39;clock tonight sound?&quot;

&quot;Sounds great,&quot; Linna answered.

&quot;Wonderful. I&#39;ve already made reservations at a restaurant downtown. 
I&#39;ll be there to pick you up tonight then.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; she said happily, adding, &quot;Take care.&quot;

&quot;You too,&quot; Sylia answered regretfully as she hung up. Just then she 
heard the dressing room door open, put on her best fake smile, and went 
back to work.

---Later That Evening---

Nene stood impatiently in front of the microwave in her small apartment, 
waiting for the bag of popcorn to finish popping. Finally, she smiled as 
the last of the kernels popped. She opened the microwave door, grabbed 
the hot bag with one hand as she picked up two cold drinks with the 
other, and hurried through the obstacle course of computer terminals and 
wires in her living room to the couch where Mackie was already sitting. 
Passing one of the drinks and the bag of popcorn to him, she grabbed the 
TV remote, taking a sip of her drink as she turned the set on.

Ten minutes into the feature, Mackie raised an eyebrow, &quot;So, is that 
giant turtle thing the villain?&quot; he asked.

Nene laughed, &quot;No silly! That&#39;s Gamera, defender of the Earth,&quot; she 
said, striking a pose with her arm up in the air. &quot;The aliens coming in 
the next scene are the bad guys.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you&#39;ve seen this before?&quot;

&quot;Once,&quot; she answered, adding, &quot;So did you invite Sylia over like I 
suggested?&quot;

Mackie nodded, adding, &quot;She actually seemed a bit touched you invited 
her, but she said she already had plans.&quot;

&quot;Meh, her loss,&quot; Nene said as she popped a few kernels into her mouth, 
&quot;I mean, what in the world could possibly be more fun than watching 
giant monster movies?&quot;

------

Linna looked one more time nervously in the mirror. She wasn&#39;t sure 
where she and Sylia were going tonight, but knowing Sylia it would be 
fancy. She&#39;s bought the form-fitting black dress she was wearing after 
work, as well as the black pumps and green earrings.

She still couldn&#39;t quite believe this was happening. She was going out 
on a date with Sylia Stingray. As she was debating whether or not to 
wear a necklace, she heard her doorbell ring. Quickly grabbing her coat, 
she put it on as she rushed from her bedroom through her apartment to 
the door.

&quot;Hello Sylia,&quot; she said as she opened the door, &quot;I...&quot; she forgot the 
rest of what she was going to say as she caught sight of the Knight 
Saber&#39;s leader. Sylia was dressed in a white skirt with a slit going up 
her right leg that ended just below her thigh, silver high heeled pumps, 
and a tight fitting black low-cut top with a white jacket on over it. 
Her hair, as usual, was stylishly pulled back with a blue bow. Sylia, 
seeing Linna dressed in her little black number, was likewise struck 
dumb as she admired the office lady&#39;s beauty.

&quot;So,&quot; Sylia said, finding her voice first, &quot;Are you ready to go?&quot;

&quot;Hmm? Oh, oh right,&quot; Linna answered embarrassedly as she grabbed her 
purse and left her apartment arm and arm with her date for the evening.

------

Priss took a sip of beer as Leon grabbed another slice of pizza. This 
was one of their favorite hangouts, a sports bar on the outskirts of the 
city near her trailer. As the singer set her drink down, she raised an 
eyebrow.

&quot;How many slices have you had so far?&quot; she asked. Leon looked at her 
questioningly.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;I mean we got a medium pan pizza with eight slices, and someone around 
here ate more than his share.&quot;

&quot;Oh for the love of... You want me to get us another pizza?&quot; he asked 
irritably.

Priss smirked, &quot;Nah, that&#39;s fine,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;I love getting you 
going, you know that?&quot;

&quot;Heh, so I&#39;ve noticed,&quot; he answered.

Priss took another sip of her beer before saying more seriously, &quot;Thanks 
again.&quot;

&quot;For?&quot;

&quot;For talking to Nene you big goof.&quot;

&quot;Oh, right,&quot; he said as he took another bite of his pizza, &quot;So how&#39;s 
Sylia doing?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen her today,&quot; she admitted, &quot;I&#39;ve been rehearsing with the 
band all day, remember?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Leon muttered.

&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;s fine though. Linna&#39;s been able to stay with her more 
often than I have.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I noticed,&quot; he said with a smirk, &quot;You don&#39;t suppose those two 
are...&quot; he was cut off as Priss kicked him in the shin.

&quot;Pervert,&quot; she said, smiling with amusement as Leon clutched his leg 
painfully.

------

Linna and Sylia were laughing warmheartedly in the small private dining 
booth as a waitress came over with their food, setting their meals 
before them. The restaurant, one of the most opulent in Mega Tokyo, had 
a four-star rating. As the waitress left, Sylia picked up the 
conversation from where they&#39;d left off.

&quot;So let me get this straight,&quot; she asked, &quot;On various occasions, your 
dad tried setting you up with a cousin who was a plumber, a neighbor who 
was a school gym coach, and a traffic warden?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t forget the bus driver,&quot; Linna said, at which point the two 
started laughing once again. More seriously, she added &quot;I suppose in a 
way he may have suspected my sexuality. I mean, other girls played with 
dolls, and I ran track and field.&quot;

&quot;I suppose,&quot; Sylia answered, picking up her chopsticks and separating 
them. As Linna watched her, she ventured to ask a question that had been 
nagging at her all night.

&quot;Sylia,&quot; she began, &quot;Just out of curiosity, how were you able to get a 
private booth in this restaurant on such short notice? They must have 
some sort of waiting list, don&#39;t they?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; her date answered with a mischievous grin, &quot;The Silky Doll is 
not the only business venture my family fortune has made available to 
me, you know.&quot;

Linna&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;You mean...&quot;

Sylia nodded as she went for a piece of fish on her plate, &quot;This 
restaurant and two others, as well as an art gallery. I...&quot; she stopped 
when the bit of fish fell from her chopsticks. Looking down, she saw 
that her hand was shaking again. &#145;Damn,&#39; she thought bitterly to 
herself, looking at her hand helplessly as feelings of anger and 
embarrassment rose up within her. &#145;Why does this have to happen now of 
all times?&#39; she thought as she bit her lower lip like a small child who 
had done something wrong.

Just then, a second pair of chopsticks reached over to her plate, 
picking up the fish she&#39;d dropped. She looked up, her grey eyes meeting 
the tender, understanding blue eyes of Linna as the younger woman 
reached over with her chopsticks. Sylia looked at her silently a few 
seconds before smiling warmly at her, her eyes never leaving her date&#39;s 
as she opened her mouth and allowed Linna to help her with her meal.

After a dinner in which the younger Knight Saber took turns feeding 
herself and her date, the two left, Sylia opting to let her date drive 
them. When they arrived back at the apartment, Linna opened her front 
door and turned to her.

&quot;I... I&#39;m not in the habit of inviting strangers back to my apartment,&quot; 
she began, &quot;But... If you have no plans...&quot;

Sylia smiled as she reached up, gently stroking Linna&#39;s cheek, &quot;I can&#39;t 
think of anywhere I&#39;d rather be tonight than here with you,&quot; she said, 
leaning forward and kissing the younger woman passionately as she shut 
the apartment door behind her.
