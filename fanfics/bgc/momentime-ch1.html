<pre>2042

Priss Asagiri was like a tigress when she sang, the dark brown haired 
woman&#39;s cat like eyes sparkling with a dangerous intensity. The crowd 
roared happily as she performed, her band barely keeping up as she lead 
them onward and upwards. But every show had to end sometime, and 
eventually Priss found herself standing backstage.

&quot;Yo, Priss,&quot; her drummer called as they packed up, &quot;that big guy is here 
to see you again. You want us to send him away?&quot;

Grabbing her leather jacket Priss hesitated a second then sighed. &quot;No,&quot; 
she said grimly, &quot;I guess I have to see him sometime.&quot;

In Priss&#39; eyes Leon looked wounded, more than anything else as they met 
there, the shadows stretching out around them. The revival of the AD 
Police after the recent return of Boomer related incidents had restored 
some of the life to him, given him a focus, but he still looked like 
someone had ripped him apart emotionally.

&quot;I guess we&#39;re done, then?&quot; Leon asked, light brown hair falling into 
his eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Priss said it like she meant it, pulling her battered 
leather jacket on over her stage clothes. They walked out of the 
building together silently, the back alley smelling faintly of urine and 
spilled booze. Looking up at the moon she confessed, &quot;I was fucking 
stupid getting involved with anyone in the middle of a crisis, not to 
mention being on the rebound from Nigel.&quot;

&quot;So we meant nothing to you?&quot; Leon asked harshly.

&quot;We did mean something,&quot; Priss turned around, her eyes flashing as she 
snarled, &quot;you&#39;re one of the few men who&#39;s ever gotten under my skin.&quot; 
She paused, looking away as she softly confessed, &quot;I just don&#39;t love 
you... in the way you want.&quot;

They stood there in uncomfortable silence, the tension sparking between 
them like invisible lightning. &quot;Sorry, I was out of line,&quot; Leon admitted 
after a moment.

&quot;Hell yes,&quot; Priss said grimly.

They stood there for a time, the silence enfolding them both, then Leon 
asked her, &quot;Is Sylia still running the Knight Sabers? I understand that 
there&#39;s been sightings lately but people say you look... different.&quot;

&quot;Are you asking as an AD Police officer,&quot; Priss smiled faintly as she 
looked up at the taller man thoughtfully, &quot;or a friend?&quot;

&quot;A friend,&quot; Leon smiled, shrugging, &quot;the chief isn&#39;t willing to admit he 
knows anything about the Knight Sabers, officially.&quot;

&quot;Even with everything he&#39;s seen?&quot; Priss asked with a faint smile, 
thinking back to the battle for AD Police headquarters and everything 
that he must have seen. Undead boomers had infested the whole tower and 
Nene, along with the leaders of the police had been trapped inside until 
Leon and Priss had saved them.

&quot;He figures we owe you.&quot; Leon admitted.

&quot;Damn right,&quot; Priss gave a short laugh.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Leon frowned slightly, &quot;we know the orders for us to go after 
the Knight Sabers came out of Genom, and considering they were behind 
all the shit that came afterward, you can see why he&#39;s ignoring them.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Priss nodded, &quot;good.&quot;

&quot;So, what about the Knight Sabers?&quot; Leon tried repeating the question, 
lookinng down at her impatiently.

&quot;Still operating,&quot; Priss said shortly, &quot;though there&#39;s been some... 
changes.&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot; Leon asked her, feeling exasperated, but Priss just calmly 
walked away, just leaving him standing there in the now silent alley. &quot;I 
hate when she does that,&quot; Leon muttered to himself, heading for his 
waiting motorcycle.

Meanwhile in the Silky Doll Sylia Stingray smiled as the sleekly dressed 
woman held up a very scanty looking nightie for her customer&#39;s 
examination. The way she held it drapped it over her curves, making it 
look even more sinful than normal. &quot;I think this&#39;ll look lovely on you,&quot; 
the while haired woman purred to the little blonde, &quot;why don&#39;t you try 
it on?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the young woman stammered.

Sylia moved around behind her and drapped the nightie over her, then she 
leaned forward so that her breath stirred the girl&#39;s ear as she said in 
her sexiest voice, &quot;And they would look even nicer on you with the 
matching panties.&quot;

The woman&#39;s cheeks were bright red as she looked into a mirror with the 
nightie held close to her slim body, &quot;I&#39;ll take them.&quot;

Watching the young lady go clutching her purchases Nene Romanova shook 
her head wryly. &quot;You are such a flirt, Sylia,&quot; Nene commented, the 
little blonde grinning, &quot;I&#39;m surprised that Nigel doesn&#39;t complain.&quot;

&quot;How do you know he doesn&#39;t like it?&quot; Sylia asked her wickedly as she 
scanned the shop, looking for a certain figure to arrive. Her eyes raked 
over Nene&#39;s smaller body as she asked innocently, &quot;And how&#39;s Mackey?&quot;

Nene blushed tellingly at that, looking away shyly. Mackey Stingray was 
Sylia&#39;s little brother, a boomer prototype with what could almost be 
called a soul, and not long after Nene had met him they had been drawn 
together. Thee had been difficulties, of course, but they had resolved 
them. &quot;So,&quot; she asked her in a rush, &quot;are the others coming in for the 
new suit fittings?&quot;

&quot;I think Linna and her wife are a bit too busy honeymooning,&quot; Sylia 
chuckled softly as she reached out to run a finger along Nene&#39;s cheek, 
her voice dropping to a silky whisper, &quot;so I get you and Priss all to 
myself.&quot;

Nene blushed again, fighting the urge to jerk back knowing it would just 
amuse Sylia more. She hesitated a moment, then decided to ask a question 
that had been bothering her for months. &quot;Sylia, why did Priss move in 
here with you?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Because we&#39;re dating,&quot; Sylia said it quite casually, a smile tugging at 
her lips as she waited for Nene&#39;s reaction.

&quot;You mean Priss and Nigel?&quot; Nene squeaked out.

&quot;No,&quot; Sylia shook her head firmly as she looked at Nene and gently 
explained, &quot;I mean Nigel, Priss and I are all together.&quot;

Nene&#39;s eyes got as big as saucers as a whole series of naughty thoughts 
raced through her head. &quot;But I thought..&quot; Nene stammered out softly, &quot;I 
mean, Linna and I always wondered about Priss but still... I mean...&quot;

&quot;Take a deep breath,&quot; Sylia advised her with a certain degree of 
amusement, &quot;we can&#39;t have you fainting in the middle of the store.&quot;

The doors to the shop swished open a few moments later, Priss striding 
in still dressed in her performance gear, a jacket now slung over her 
shoulder. Stalking across the room she seemed unaware of the eyes of 
cusomers resting on her, the attractive power of her almost feral 
beauty.

Priss saw Nene and Sylia standing there and noted the fierce blush on 
Nene&#39;s cheeks and asked, &quot;Teasing people again, Sylia?&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s so fun,&quot; Sylia said as Priss strode over. She smoothly kissed 
Priss, a gentle brushing of lips that Priss willingly joined, then they 
parted.

&quot;What was that for?&quot; Priss asked, noting that Nene was now beet red.

&quot;Just a promise for later,&quot; Sylia answered with a sexy smile, moving off 
to shoo the last few customers out of the shop.

&quot;You all right?&quot; Priss asked Nene with a slightly sheepish smile as they 
waited for Sylia to finish ejecting the ladies.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Nene said with a blush still coloring her cheeks, &quot;just 
surprised, I guess.&quot;

&quot;Sylia told you, I suppose?&quot; Priss asked. When Nene nodded Priss smiled 
to herself slightly as she softly mused, &quot;I think I finally see why 
people write love songs...&quot;

Sylia returned to their side just in time to hear that. &quot;Why Priss,&quot; she 
took her hand in hers and squeezed gently, &quot;you&#39;re a romantic.&quot;

Priss scowled but a faint blush colored her cheeks, too, and she didn&#39;t 
try to break Sylia&#39;s grip. &quot;Let&#39;s get these damn tests over with,&quot; she 
grumbled, leading the way to the conealed elevator and pointedly 
ignoring Sylia&#39;s grin.

&quot;This is for fitting the fifth generation hardsuits, right?&quot; Nene asked 
eagerly as they entered the concealed elevator.

&quot;Nigel, Mackey and I have a new variation almost ready,&quot; Sylia agreed, 
&quot;we just need scan data to verify fit.&quot;

&quot;Better add a bit to Nene&#39;s,&quot; Priss casually patted Nene&#39;s tummy, &quot;I 
think she&#39;s been snacking too much lately.&quot;

&quot;Priss!&quot; Nene bleated.

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t know,&quot; Sylia surprised Nene by wrapping her arms around the 
other girl from behind, &quot;I think she&#39;s just adorable the way she is.&quot;

&quot;Sylia,&quot; Nene blushed again.

Sylia met Priss&#39;s gaze, &quot;Besides, Mackey isn&#39;t complaining.&quot;

&quot;You two talk about that?&quot; Nene squeaked as she spun around to look into 
Sylia&#39;s amused eyes. Quickly realizing that the taller woman was teasing 
her yet again Nene pouted and groaned, &quot;You&#39;re so mean!&quot;

&quot;Feeling better?&quot; Sylia asked Priss softly.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Priss shrugged, &quot;the nausea comes and goes.&quot;

&quot;Well if it doesn&#39;t go soon I&#39;m taking you into the lab,&quot; Sylia said. 
Cutting off Priss&#39; protest she added, &quot;I&#39;d worry about you, otherwise.&quot;

In another part of the bustling city of Tokyo the restaurant was busy, 
men and women rushing about to fill orders and serve drinks amid soft 
music. Over in a corner booth candles flickered for a romantic diner, 
somehow isolated from the noise in the rest of the building, the two 
women talking together quietly.

Reika Chang smiled across the table at Linna, the taller black haired 
woman gracefully raising her glass in a toast, &quot;To us.&quot;

&quot;To us,&quot; Linna Yamazaki echoed, her brown hair falling into her eyes. 
She smiled faintly as she confessed, &quot;You know when you were introduced 
as my new supervisor, I never expected something like this to happen.&quot;

Reika chuckled softly, taking a drink. &quot;Neither was I,&quot; she conceded, 
&quot;though I have to confess I was attracted to you almost as soon as we 
met.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Linna asked, a bit suirprised.

&quot;You were so adorable dressed in that suit,&quot; Reika remembered fondly, 
&quot;and when you gave me that smile... wow.&quot;

Linna blushed charmingly at the compliment. &quot;I was so nervous when you 
were being introduced to us,&quot; she softly confessed, &quot;my last couple of 
supervisors there were just jerks, then there was all that craziness 
with the Boomers..&quot;

&quot;I remember,&quot; Reika nodded grimly.

The Boomers in the city to Tokyo and around the world went mad, though 
few people really knew why. All they did know was that people were 
injured or killed by supposedly hasrmless Boomers, and their 
conventional police seemed powerless to stop them. Only the Knight 
Sabers had been able to stop it, something only a select few people 
could know.

&#39;I woder when I can tell her?&#39; Linna thought. She smiled at Reika as she 
resumed, &quot;And when I came back, I expected more of the same.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Reika laughed.

Linna grinned, &quot;Instead I got a dynamic, gorgeously attractive woman who 
inspires me every day.&quot; A wink, &quot;Even at work, too.&quot;

Reika reached over to squeeze Linna&#39;s hands gently. &quot;When I went back to 
work I was still in mourning for my sister,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I was 
surprised out of my grief by meeting you. I really think you restored 
light and joy to my life, Linna.&quot;

Linna hesitated then bent over the table to gently press her lips to 
Reika&#39;s. &quot;I love you,&quot; she said as they finally parted.

&quot;I love you, too,&quot; Reika&#39;s voice was faintly husky. A faint blush 
colored her cheeks as she said, &quot;Do you want to go back to my place 
after dinner?&quot;

Linna blushed too but her voice was eager, &quot;Please!&quot;

End

Notes and comments: I&#39;ve always been firmly in the camp that believes 
that Priss is at least bisexual, if not a lesbian, and I really didn&#39;t 
buy into the whole Leon/Priss thing. The idea of her moving in with 
Sylia and sharing Nigel is an unconventional resolution to the situation 
between them, but it seemed the best way to handle it. As long time BGC 
fans know Reika Chang is from the original series, and is a character 
whom I have a fondness for. The idea of her being a senior business 
woman was a bit of a stretch, but eh...</pre>
