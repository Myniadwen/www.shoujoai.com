Brian J. Mason looked out the window of Genom&#39;s tower, feeling a deep 
surge of satisfaction at how far he had gone. The black haired man had 
his hands in his pockets as he soaked up the silence of the building, 
glad that most of the staff were gone for the day. His corner office was 
spacious and well appointed, a massive desk facing the door, leather 
chair, mini-bar and a cutting edge computer set up.

A soft chime pulled him away from the view and Mason frowned, walking 
over to the desk. &quot;Situation?&quot; he asked as he took his suit coat off, 
tossing it aside and sitting down as the holographic interface 
activated.

The male voice of the computer answered as a image appeared of the Genom 
mainframe&#39;s virtual interior, &quot;Unauthorized access detected.&quot;

Mason smiled as he saw the intruder&#39;s icon become entangled with the 
second stage defenses, &quot;Location and identity?&quot;

&quot;Unknown,&quot; the computer responded, &quot;the intruder is bouncing a signal 
off several satellites as well as routing through several commercial 
servers.&quot;

&quot;A pro, then,&quot; Mason frowned. As they spoke the icon slipped through the 
second line, moving tentatively forward. &quot;Assessment?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Cybernetically augmented hacker,&quot; the computer concluded, &quot;response is 
too fast for a human operative but not fast enough to be pure artificial 
intelligence.&quot;

Mason nodded his agreement, &quot;Makes sense. Deploy the neural feedback 
mines, please.&quot;

&quot;Activated,&quot; the computer answered and in moments the intruder 
disengaged, flitting away from the system and probably hurting.

&quot;Nicely done,&quot; Mason smiled. &quot;Any chance of chasing them?&quot;

The computer actually sounded a bit frustrated as it replied, &quot;I tracked 
it from here to China, then a Canadian routing and over to Singapore, 
but I lost them there.&quot;

&quot;They were hitching on a number or corporate data streams,&quot; Mason noted 
admiringly, &quot;they&#39;re very good.&quot; He drummed his fingers on the desk top 
a moment, &quot;Increase system security to level two.&quot;

&quot;Lethal force authorized?&quot; the computer asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Mason said after considering the issue a moment, &quot;but you&#39;re 
welcome to scare them as much as you want.&quot;

&quot;Acknowledged,&quot; it answered, sounding a bit disappointed.

Mason logged on to the building directory, checking to see if Jeena 
Malso was still in. According to the directory she was in her office, 
though Mason had to concede that wasn&#39;t too useful if Jeena had just 
forgotten to log off.

&quot;Jeena Malso&#39;s office,&quot; Mason ordered as he touched the phone patch on 
the surface of his desk.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Malso asked irritably as her face appeared on a holographic 
screen above the desk. Her black hair had a bit of grey showing through, 
her face lined from a interesting life and choice of work. Unlike most 
staff she didn&#39;t have a boomer answering her phones, apparently 
preferring a human secretary or herself.

&quot;We had a attempted security breach,&quot; Mason reported.

Jeena&#39;s eyes narrowed, &quot;On the computers, I think, since I&#39;d have gotten 
a report from our guards otherwise.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mason nodded seriously, &quot;a hacker got by the outer firewall and 
slipped through two tiers of security.&quot;

She sat up in surprise as Jeena said, &quot;That&#39;s bad.&quot; While in no way a 
system expert she knew enough to understand both how hard it was to 
penetrate their system. &quot;Any idea who did it?&quot; she asked hopefully.

&quot;They covered their tracks too well,&quot; Mason admitted, &quot;though if they 
try again I&#39;m hopeful we&#39;ll get more.&quot;

Jeena nodded, her expression thoughtful as she turned over the facts she 
had in her head. &quot;Do you think it&#39;s related to Miss Stingray arriving?&quot; 
she asked.

Mason frowned, &quot;It&#39;s only been a week since she arrived....&quot;

&quot;The timing is interesting,&quot; Jeena mused. &quot;Should we increase security 
on her?&quot;

&quot;Not without asking,&quot; Mason said after a moment, &quot;she is the boss, after 
all.&quot;

Jeena chuckled softly, &quot;Yeah, well we&#39;ll see.&quot;

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Mason smiled slightly as he sat back, &quot;I&#39;m just trying to keep 
you in the loop as head of security.&quot;

&quot;I appreciate it,&quot; Jeena agreed as she logged off.

Jeena Malso&#39;s office was cluttered and untidy, much like it&#39;s mistress. 
There were takeout cartons on the desk, files scattered about and at 
least one change of clothes discarded in the corner. Despite all that 
Jeena easily navigated the mess, finding the documents she needed before 
grabbing her jacket to go.

&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; Jeena muttered to herself as her office locked 
automatically behind her. She flipped through Sylia Stingray&#39;s file, 
committing the data to memory. Sylia was a genius, rated in the top ten 
percent of the population, and had graduated valedictorian from her 
overseas university. Bo criminal record, no school comments, tho Jeena 
took that with a grain of salt. If Jeena had learned anything over the 
years, it was money could buy a lot of silence.

&quot;Miss Malso,&quot; a female boomer nodded a greeting as she strode into the 
elevator. Her long silver hair glinted in the artificial light, her 
simple body suit hugging her slim body.

&quot;Sub-basement parking,&quot; Jeena ordered absent mindedly as she read.

&quot;Of course,&quot; the boomer smiled warmly.

&#39;Wonder if I should check into my contacts out there?&#39; Jeena mused as 
she flipped through a university transcript. While Jeena didn&#39;t know if 
any of her classmates had been hired out there, she did think she 
remembered a contact from a police conference. &#39;Maybe they&#39;d spill sone 
dirt?&#39; she thought.

Cheerfully the boomer reported, &quot;Sub-basement.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jeena nodded as she headed out into the dimmer light, passing 
by a limo as she headed for her car. &#39;Quincy is working late again,&#39; she 
noted.

&quot;Welcome, Miss Malso,&quot; her car said as it recognized her, the driver&#39;s 
side door swinging open invitingly.

Tossing the file on the seat Jeena slid in with a sigh. &quot;Take me home,&quot; 
she ordered, &quot;shortest route.&quot;

&quot;Programming route,&quot; the car intoned as the doors closed, &quot;route one 
activated.&quot;

&#39;Thank god I installed that artificial intelligence upgrade,&#39; Jeena 
admitted as she went over the documents again, the car starting up then 
driving out onto the quiet evening streets.

From his place up in the tower Quincy R Rosencroitz watched the car 
disappear into the night, the old man standing straight with the 
assistance of metallic braces added to his legs. The eighty some years 
old man frowned as he reluctantly turned away, striding over to his 
desk. Reaching up he pushed his white hair out of the way, revealing 
what looked like plug ins set into the back of his head.

&quot;Activating interface,&quot; the computer said flatly as cables dropped down 
from the ceiling.

There was a wet sound as Quincy plugged himself in, easing himself down 
as he sat back at his desk and closed his eyes. His eyes jerked about as 
information poured right into his brain, processing the data faster than 
any normal human could. He finally relaxed as the data slowed, his eyes 
opening and looking rather vague.

&quot;I&#39;ll never get used to that,&quot; Quincy sighed.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the shadowy figure said from the hologram on Quincy&#39;s desk. 
Quincy still didn&#39;t know who he was, but this individual had provided 
him with important data several times. To be blunt Quincy owed him, and 
had not yet payed back the debt.

&quot;Not your fault,&quot; Quincy mused as he thought about what he had learned. 
&quot;The hacker....&quot; he frowned, &quot;what was the target?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the shadow sounded frustrated, &quot;security stopped them 
before I could see what they were after.&quot;

&quot;Not good,&quot; Quincy scowled. &quot;I could order Jeena and Mason to let them 
in a bit farther....&quot; he suggested.

&quot;No, both Jeena and Mason would see it as an unusual request,&quot; the 
shadowy man shook his head, &quot;Best just to keep your eyes open.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Quincy nodded. &quot;Should I call you using the number you 
left me earlier?&quot;

&quot;Yes, leave a message and I&#39;ll get back to you,&quot; the shadowy figure 
promised as he added, &quot;good luck.&quot;

&quot;You too,&quot; Quincy agreed as his mysterious contact disappeared.
