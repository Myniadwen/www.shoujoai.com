fanfiction by <a href="../authors/vermilion.html">Vermilion</a><br> </h2>
<pre>


Hi there.  I&#39;m Vermilion.

This is my first attempt at a Bubblegum Crisis lemon fanfic.  I
have written a Sailor Moon lemon, but I felt that it didn&#39;t have 
much of a plot(you can mail me if you want a copy).  This time around,
I have learned my lesson and will make an attempt at having some kind 
of plot.  

Bubblegum Crisis is the property of Kenichi Sonoda, Artmic, Youmex,
AnimEigo, and maybe others.

This fic takes place between Crisis and Crash and is written in a first
person perspective.  Enjoy and let me know what you thought of it.

BUBBLEGUM CRISIS: CONFESSIONS
by Vermilion

My alarm had gone off without warning, as it usually had.  I reached
over to turn it off.  I looked out at the morning sky.  It was a 
beautiful day.

As I was about to get up, I felt weird, like the wind was penetrating 
my entire body.  I looked below my blanket to find out I was naked.
How could this have been?  I never sleep naked.  This question was
immediately answered when I felt a strange warmth on my back.  That
was when I saw the hands wrapped around my waist.  I can&#39;t remember
right now, but I could swear that I&#39;ve seen these small hands before.
I strategically turn over to find out who I had supposedly slept with.  

My god!  It can&#39;t be!

In the flesh was someone I would have never imagined I&#39;d see in my 
bed, Nene!!  She too was naked and in a deep sleep.  

How did she get here?  I remember now.

She had come over after something terrible had happened to her.  I

comforted her the best I could and that was when she made her 
confession to me.  I don&#39;t know right now what had happened after
that, but I do know that we somehow ended up making love to each
other.  

I was able to get up being careful not to wake Nene.  I noticed, on 
my way to the closet, that there were a few pieces of lingerie on the
floor.  That sight brought back a few memories.  But right now, I had 
to get dressed.  I threw on some clothes and went to the kitchen.  I 
had set a pot of coffee on the burner and waiting for it to perk when 
all the memories of yesterday surfaced in my mind.  It was a strange
day indeed.... 

Like today, my alarm went off at its usual time.  I reached over

and shut it off.  I looked outside and saw the morning sun lighting
up the city.  It was a sight that became more beautiful after I stopped
doing work as a Knight Saber.  I mean, I did like the money, who 
doesn&#39;t?  I just didn&#39;t like the way I had to earn that money.  Risking
my life at every turn, it just wasn&#39;t me.  I had to find a job where
I could get a lot of money without risking my life.  But where?

In order to find that perfect job, I had to get up first.  I walked over
to the closet and threw on some old exercise clothes.  I usually went
on a run at this time of day, but, for some reason, this one time I 
didn&#39;t feel like it.  I guess I put these clothes on out of habit.  
Hopefully I wouldn&#39;t be doing this much longer.

Anyway, I had just sat down on the couch about ready to read the paper
when there a knock on my door.  &quot;It&#39;s 8 AM,&quot; I thought.  &quot;Who could be 

here at this time of day?&quot;  I opened the door and saw Nene on the 
other side.  She was visiting me often, but never this early.  

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;  I asked her.
&quot;Just stopped by on my way to work.  May I come in for a bit?&quot;  I 
let Nene inside.  She was wearing her AD Police uniform, obviously. 
&quot;I&#39;m actually a bit early, so I decided to say hi.  It&#39;s a good thing I 
stopped you before your run.&quot;  Good thing?  Try a lucky shot.  Nene
continued talking, &quot;I wanted to give you this.&quot;  She handed me a
flyer.  &quot;Omni Corporations is hiring stock brokers right now.  Give
it a shot, Linna.  I know how much you like money.&quot;  She let out 
a giggle.  


&quot;That&#39;s not funny,&quot; I replied to her last statement with seriousness.
I read the flyer over and figured that the job I&#39;ve wanted came right 
to me.  I didn&#39;t have to look for it, like so many of my other jobs, 
outside of the Knight Sabers, of course.

Since Nene was here, I decided to see what was up with everyone else.
&quot;So, anyway,&quot; I had said in order to change to subject at hand, &quot;have
you heard anything from the others?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.  I found out that Priss is going to a big time record studio
to record her songs.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yup.  It&#39;s neat really.  Now, I won&#39;t be arresting her as often as I 
did.  &lt;giggle&gt;  Oh, by the way, later today, Mackie will be going to
Germany to study.&quot;

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s great news.  Anything from Sylia at all?&quot;

&quot;No, nothing.  But hey, that&#39;s Sylia.  We&#39;ll hear from her soon.&quot;
She looked at her watch.  &quot;I gotta go.  I&#39;ll be leaving early to see 
Mackie board his plane.  Why don&#39;t you come too, Linna?  Please.&quot;

&quot;Well, I guess.  I don&#39;t have anything better to do.&quot;

&quot;Great.  His plane leaves at 2.  I&#39;ll see you there.&quot;  She gave me a
wink and happily walked out the door.  That last act had struck me as
odd.  Why would Nene wink at me?  She&#39;d never done that before.  
Then again, during the conversation, she had sat awfully close to me.
It had struck me as strange although during recent visits, she would
sit just as close.  I wondered why.  Maybe it was because she 
was a......what am I thinking?  There is no way on this Earth.  I had 
better things to do than worry about her.  I had a job interview to 
attend.

I went back to my closet and busted out a blue business dress.  I had
bought this for just such a job.  I bought it so long ago and now I 
finally have a chance to use it.  I quickly put it on and headed off 
toward the Omni Corporation.  During the way there, I had begun
to think about Nene and her actions.  The way she sat next to me.
It felt good, like she was a guy and we were in love.  I quickly got
my mind off that subject.  I refused to think about that, at least for
a while.  After what seemed to me like a few minutes, I was at the 
Omni Corporation.

I don&#39;t exactly remember how the interview went, all that I know
is I got the job and start next week.  Oh well...

I was back in my car when I looked at the time.  &quot;10 AM,&quot; I thought.
&quot;I&#39;ve got plenty of time before Mackie&#39;s plane leaves.  I&#39;ll go back
home and rest for a bit.&quot;  During the drive, the thoughts returned.  
I began to feel....no, I couldn&#39;t let myself think of it.  I stepped 
on the accelerator and drove as fast as I could.  I was lucky enough
not to get a ticket, which was a first for me.  I had gotten a weird 
feeling by this time, a feeling that this was going to be a strange 
day.   

I returned home and darted for my bedroom.  I fell down on the bed
and stared at the ceiling.  That was when the thoughts returned once 
again.  This time, though, I couldn&#39;t block them out.  They were 
attacking me with full force.  My resistance to them was useless now
as they controlled my actions.  I unbuttoned my blouse, pushed up my
bra, and started to play with my nipples.  I pinched and flicked them
with all of my might.  I was moaning out in sheer pleasure as I imagined 
the person doing this to me was....no, not that, anyone but....  

My private area was feeling warm at this point.  I could feel that my 
panties were wet and my pussy was wanting to be touched.  I quickly 
reached up under my dress, pulled my underwear down to my knees,
and inserted two fingers into my love hole.  As I was thrusting my 
fingers in and out, my other hand was busy flicking a nipple.  
The feeling was incredible.  I had masturbated before and had 
thought of many guys, but this time, it was a sensation beyond 
belief.  I was thinking of...

The feeling was so great that I had unknowingly moved my hips up
and down to the movement of my fingers.  When I noticed my hip
movement, I knew that orgasm wasn&#39;t too far away.  I had wanted
to reach orgasm quickly so I inserted a third finger into my slit 
and pumped as fast as I could.  My orgasm hit me like a bullet
train.  I let out a very loud yelp of pleasure.  So loud, in fact,
that I thought the neighbors heard it.  But I didn&#39;t care at this 
point.  I was far too tired from the orgasm that I had experienced.
The weird thing about it was when I orgasmed, I was thinking of....
her???  Forgetting about it, I pulled my fingers out and fell asleep
almost instantly.

When I finally woke up, my clock was saying 1:07 PM.  &quot;Oh, man,&quot;
I said to myself, &quot;I better get to the airport.&quot;  As I about to get
up, I felt something stretching against my knees.  I had forgotten
about my moment of self-pleasure.  I pulled my panties back up
and as I did, I felt that three of my fingers were sticky.  &quot;Oh, yeah,
right,&quot; I thought.  I walked to the bathroom and washed my hands.
Afterwards, I pushed my bra down, buttoned up my blouse, and walked 
to my car.  From here, it was off to the airport.

I arrived at the airport at about 1:30.  I looked around and that&#39;s
when it hit me.  &quot;Damn, I forgot to ask Nene where Mackie&#39;s plane
is.&quot;  Just then, I heard a voice.

&quot;Linna!  Over here.&quot;

It was Nene&#39;s; I recognized that high pitch anywhere.  

&quot;Mackie&#39;s plane is at gate 20.  C&#39;mon let&#39;s go.&quot;  I followed her to 
the gate and there was Mackie, packed for the long trip.  I couldn&#39;t
help but notice that the people around us were looking in our 
direction.  I wondered why they were looking at us the way they 
were.  Also, no one else , besides Nene and me, were at the gate.  
Not even Sylia was around.  I wondered where she could be.  It isn&#39;t
like her to miss out on something like this.

&quot;Where is everyone?&quot; I asked.

Mackie spoke up, &quot;Priss starts her recording gig today.  As for Sylia,
I haven&#39;t heard anything from her for a while.  Oh well...&quot;  He let out
a grunt to hide his true feeling of loneliness.  At least, that&#39;s what I
thought he was feeling.

We continued to talk about anything that came to mind until it was
time for Mackie to board his plane.  &quot;Well, I gotta go.  I&#39;ll see you 
soon.&quot;

&quot;Good-bye,&quot;  Nene and I said in unison as we saw Mackie walk the 
boarding chute.  When he was gone, Nene and I walked off.  I don&#39;t
know how Nene was feeling, but I felt a bit empty inside when Mackie
left.  I felt that I just lost a good friend.  Almost like I felt when
Irene died.  Anyhow, those thoughts disappeared when I noticed
Nene looking at me funny.

&quot;Err..why are you looking at me like that?&quot; I asked her.

&quot;What happened to your hair?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;  That&#39;s when it hit me why everyone was staring at us.
They were actually staring at me.

&quot;Here, use this.&quot; Nene handed me a brush which I gladly accepted.
I quickly combed my hair into its natural style and returned the brush

back.  &quot;Thanks,&quot; I replied.

&quot;No problem.  Hey Linna, there&#39;s a place not too far from here that
serves the best food in town.  Wanna go there?&quot;

I was glad to know some things never change.  But I was feeling a 
bit hungry.  I hadn&#39;t eaten all day and it was starting to get to me.
&quot;Sure,&quot; I said, &quot;let&#39;s check this place out.  We&#39;ll take my car.  
Is that okay with you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.  Besides, Leon dropped me off here.  My scooter is back
in the AD Police lot.  You think you could...&quot;

&quot;Sure, why not?&quot; I answered.  We went back to my car, way in 
the back of a far lot(that&#39;s what I get for sleeping in) and headed
for this place Nene was talking about.  

When we arrived, I noticed that this place was a buffet house.
Typical of Nene to pick a place like this to eat.  But at this point,

I was hungry and anything would do for now.  We went inside
and were served right away.  I almost busted out laughing when
the hostess&#39;  first comment was, &quot;Hello Miss Romanova, your usual
table?&quot;  The fact we were in a public place, in addition to Nene 
flashing me a dirty look, kept me from goofing on her, just like
Priss and I used to do in our Knight Saber days.

We had sat down at a window table, Nene&#39;s usual spot I guess.
I had made for myself just a salad with fruit punch while Nene
seemed to get one of every item available.  &quot;I&#39;m surprised she can
still fit in her clothes,&quot; I thought.  But then again, it wasn&#39;t like 
me to eat only a salad.  Oh, well, there&#39;s a first time for everything,
I guess.  

Nene started the conversing, &quot;Hey, Linna, what&#39;s with just that?&quot;
She was pointing to my &quot;meal&quot;.

&quot;I feel like having this, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine.  So anyway, what are you doing tonight?&quot;

&quot;Glad you asked.  I finally have a date.  I&#39;m going out with this
really nice guy.  Maybe we&#39;ll come over to your place so I can
introduce you two.&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah, sure.  I don&#39;t have a whole lot planned.  I&#39;ll probably 
just sit around and relax.&quot;

&quot;By the way, did you take my Omni idea?&quot;

&quot;Yes and I got the job.  I start next week.&quot;

&quot;Great.&quot;  I don&#39;t remember what else was said after that.  All I 
know is that we finished our meals(Nene paid for us, I must remember

to thank her sometime), I dropped Nene off at AD Police headquarters,
and we went our own ways.  She went on her date, and I did some 
errands I had planned to do today, but had forgotten.  

That night, I was returning from a friend&#39;s house when I saw a figure 
running from a motor scooter.  I knew it was Nene from the scooter&#39;s
design.  I wondered what she was doing here.  Why would she be here
when she had her date?  I quickly got out of my car and rushed up 
to my door.  There I saw Nene on her knees.  She was crying and it
looked like part of her dress was torn.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;  I asked her.

&quot;&lt;sob&gt; Help...me...&lt;sob&gt;  Linna.&quot; 

&quot;Hold on, let&#39;s go inside first.&quot;  I opened the door and helped Nene
in.  I grabbed her shoulders and said in the kind voice I rarely used
with her, &quot;Now tell me, what happened?  And why is your dress torn?&quot;

&quot;We went out &lt;sob&gt; to dinner and then we&lt;sob&gt; went to his car 
and that&#39;s where he.... &lt;sob&gt; ....he....&quot;

&quot;He what?&quot;

&quot;He....................tried.......to rape me.&quot;

My eyes nearly popped out of the sockets when I heard this.  How
could anyone try to do something like that to her?  Obviously, this guy
had no heart whatsoever.  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; was the best reply I could 
think of.  I reached over and hugged her in order to calm her down.
She was still crying, but I didn&#39;t blame her.  I&#39;d be crying my eyes
out too if this happened to me.  I continued to hug her until she 
stopped crying.  This was when things started to get really weird.

&quot;Linna,&quot; she said, &quot;I have something to say.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I...really didn&#39;t love this guy I went out with tonight.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; I chuckled out, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t either.&quot;

&quot;I have to tell you something very personal.  Do you promise
you won&#39;t tell anybody?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot;  I wasn&#39;t really quite sure what to say, so I said that; it
was the first thing that came into my head.

&quot;I&#39;m already in love with someone, someone who doesn&#39;t know
about it.&quot;


&quot;Great.  Who?&quot; I asked her.  What Nene said next took me completely
by surprise.  It was the last thing I had expected her to say.


&quot;Linna, I&#39;m in love with you.&quot;

I let Nene go and stepped back in horror.  &quot;Did I hear that right?&quot;
I thought furiously.  &quot;She loves me?  No, that can&#39;t be right.&quot;

Nene gave me the biggest eyes I had ever seen on anyone.  &quot;Yes,&quot;
she said, &quot;it&#39;s true.  I&#39;m a lesbian.  I knew you wouldn&#39;t understand.
Now you&#39;re afraid of me, aren&#39;t you?&quot;  She lowered her head in shame.
&quot;I&#39;ll be going now.&quot;  She headed towards the door but I stopped her

before she could leave.

&quot;Don&#39;t go.  I&#39;m not scared of you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re...not?&quot;

&quot;No.  In fact, it&#39;s feels good that someone has a crush on me, although
it is you.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  I&#39;ll keep your little secret if you can keep this a secret.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;  I don&#39;t know what came over me, but I had wrapped 
my arms around her and planted my lips over hers and kissed her with
an unmatched passion.  I was so into the kiss that I put my tongue in
her mouth with Nene exchanging the favor.  She then put one of her
hands on my butt and squeezed it.  I let out a moan in response.  We 
broke the kiss off for air still holding each other.

&quot;Nene,&quot; I said, &quot;you&#39;re a great kisser.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not bad yourself,&quot; she replied.  She then placed her mouth
next to my ear and replied very softly, &quot;Linna..&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; I whispered back.

&quot;Make love to me.&quot;  She started to suck on my earlobe.  I wanted
to stop her, but I felt as if something was preventing me from doing 
so.  I guess it was because when Nene was sucking my lobe, I suddenly
got extremely horny.  That was probably it.  

Anyway, I pulled away softly to say, &quot;Get in my room and make
yourself comfortable while I go change.  I&#39;ll be there shortly.&quot;  
With excitement in her eyes, Nene went into my room, swaying

her hips back and forth in doing so.  That never turned me on before,
but this time, it sure did.  I wondered why, even now.

Well, anyway, I walked into the bathroom where I had put a bag
containing something I usually didn&#39;t buy, but this time, I felt
like owning it.  I reached into the bag and pulled out the red lace
bra and panty.  &quot;I actually get to use these,&quot; I thought.  I quickly 
took off my clothes and put the lingerie on.  It fit me like second 
skin.  I did a 360 to see how it looked on me.  &quot;Oh boy,&quot; I mumbled,
&quot;will Nene like this!&quot;  I puckered my lips and blew a kiss into the 
mirror, wondering how Nene would react to that.  I took a final look
at myself and noticed that the lace had caused my nipples to harden.
Add to the fact that my panties were now wet in the middle and I
was ready to give Nene a show she wouldn&#39;t forget.  I walked to my 
bedroom not wanting Nene to wait for too long. 

I was in my room, the moonlight lightening it up just enough for 
us to see each other.  Nene was standing by the edge of the bed
with a surprise for me.  She was wearing a jet black lacy teddy(at
least I thought it was jet black).  I looked into her eyes and stopped
for a moment.  I didn&#39;t think I could go through with this.  For some
reason, it didn&#39;t feel right.  Nene ended those thoughts when she 
grabbed my waist and pulled me up so close that our breasts were
pressing against one another.

&quot;You look beautiful,&quot; she seductively whispered.

&quot;You&#39;re very pretty,&quot; I whispered back.  We stared at each
other for a few seconds before we once again locked lips.  We

were completely absorbed by this kiss, even more so than the previous
one.  This is where things got real exciting.

While we were kissing, Nene took her hands and unstrapped my bra.
I took a short step back and let it fall to the floor. At the same 
time, I was busy pulling her shoulder straps down, but was having
trouble in doing so.  Nene realized this and broke the kiss.  She gave 
me a sultry smile and pulled her arms out of the straps.  Then she
took off her teddy, much like a swimsuit.  Seeing her naked body
turned me on even more.  It was strange, though.  I&#39;d see her naked
whenever we suited up, and I wouldn&#39;t feel anything sexually toward
her.  This time around, I felt like jumping her.  


Nene took my left breast in her hand and sucked on the nipple.  The 
feeling of her tongue circling my hardened nipple sent chills down my
spine.  It was a sensational feeling, one that I never felt when a guy 
did what she was doing.  I arched my head back and let out a moan
of ecstasy.  The only thing I could do at the moment was run my hands
through her soft red hair.  &quot;That&#39;s feels good,&quot; I replied to her. 

She looked up at me and said, &quot;If you thought that was great, wait
until you see this.&quot;  She dropped to her knees and pulled my panties
down to my ankles.  I lifted my feet up so the panty could come off.
She then put one hand on my waist and used the fingers of the other
hand to part my swollen pussy lips.  I could next feel her tongue 
darting into my wet love box.  This feeling was much more incredible
than when she was licking my nipple.  As she continued to lick my
slit, I kept myself busy by flicking and pinching my nipples letting out
louder moans, which were almost shrills, of pleasure.  &quot;Nene..&quot; 
I grunted out.

&quot;What?&quot; Nene got up off her knees to look at me eye to eye.  I
pulled open the blanket on my bed.

&quot;Crawl in,&quot; I suggested.  Nene wasted no time in doing so, with me
following suit.  When we were in the bed, it was my turn to do the
pleasuring.  I encompassed my mouth on one of her breasts while
I groped the other one.  I couldn&#39;t help but notice how good they
felt in my hand and mouth.  Meanwhile, Nene was busy grunting
things like, &quot;Oh yes...Linna....oh...&quot;  Suddenly I felt her lightly
grabbing my head and lifting it to where I could see her lovely face.
She the asked me, &quot;Wanna do a 59?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s 69,&quot; I replied with a grin.  &quot;Okay, let&#39;s do it.  But first,
I have to get something.&quot;  I rolled back to reach for the vibrator
I had in my drawer.  I opened the drawer, drew it out, and showed 
it to my now lover. She let out a short squeal of excitement and in
anticipation, she began to ready her pussy for it.

I positioned myself on top of Nene facing the opposite direction.
This was the first time I actually got to look at her red haired(I 
assumed that it was red) bush.  I also got to see how wet and swollen
her pink lips were.  It looked good, so I decided to give it a taste test
first.  I started by circling my tongue around the lips to get a first 
impression of what was to come.  &quot;The hell with it,&quot; I thought and
put my tongue as far as it would go into her.  Her response was to
do the same thing to my love hole.  As far as I know, we both indulged
in the taste of each other for quite some time, lapping up every
drop of juice we released.  I was so into it that I had forgotten
about the vibrator for a while.  That is until I went to use that
hand to part Nene&#39;s lips.  &quot;Oh, yeah, I forgot.&quot;  I said to myself
as I turned the vibrator on.  It was emitting a low buzzing noise,
which was almost hypnotizing.  With my free hand, I opened
Nene up and slid it in.  I was amazed how easily it went in.

&quot;Oh god....Linna!&quot;  That was the only sentence I could hear
through all the moaning and shrieks Nene was emitting.  I knew
that she was enjoying every moment that the vibrator was inside her.
As her way of saying thanks, she inserted what I felt was three of
her fingers into my hole.  It almost felt exactly like when I use 
the vibrator on myself.  Within moments, I was emitting the same
shrieks and moans she was.  I pushed the vibrator in deeper in reply.
To my surprise, when I pushed it in, some of Nene&#39;s juices squirted
out.  I knew then that she was going to orgasm at any moment.  But
I didn&#39;t want her to cum now, I wasn&#39;t at that point yet.  I wanted 
us to cum together.  I turned the vibrator off and pulled it out a bit.
Nene felt this and in retaliation, withdrew her fingers from my pussy.

&quot;What&#39;s the big deal?&quot;, she said tired from the pleasure I was 

giving her.

&quot;I want to cum with you,&quot; I replied turning my head to see her.
I turned around in her direction, pulled out the vibrator, and threw
it on the ground.  I then placed my hand on her pussy while I
placed her hand on mine.

&quot;Let&#39;s cum together,&quot; I whispered.  At that moment, we began to
finger each other&#39;s love holes.  I felt the pleasure go through me like
waves in a pond and I was pretty sure Nene felt the same.  The 
passionate screams from her was my clue to this.  As we were 
fingering one another, Nene was kissing and sucking on my neck.
My response to this was to use my free hand to massage her breast.
This had continued for what seemed to be an eternity until I could 
feel my cunt tightening around my partner&#39;s fingers.  Hers was also
tightening around mine.  Suddenly, as if we had the same mind, we 
forcefully forced our fingers out of the other&#39;s love box.  

Nene was now yelling at the top of her lungs, &quot;LINNAAAAAAAAA!!!&quot;
and her orgasm hit her.  I assumed it was quite violent judging from
the wild spasms she was doing.  At the same time, my orgasm hit 
me, but not like hers.  I felt a rush of cum building up inside me
and suddenly, it shot out like a cannon all over Nene&#39;s stomach.  I
rolled off her and onto my side, unable to move.  That orgasm, the
greatest one in my life, had drained me of all my energy.  I fell
asleep almost instantaneously.  Nene had said something in my
ear before I slept, but I couldn&#39;t recognize it.

(Note:  Linna&#39;s done flashbacking.  This is what&#39;s happening now.)
Now there&#39;s ringing in my ears.  Oh yeah, I forgot about the coffee.
It&#39;s done now.  I walk over to get out a mug and fill it up.  The 
paper is at my door when I open it.  I pick up the paper and read
it, but I just can&#39;t.  I&#39;m still thinking about last night.  How could
I have done what I did?  

The door to my room opens.  Nene walks out still naked and carrying
her clothes in one arm.  She asks me, &quot;May I take a shower here?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; I reply not bothering to look at her.  I&#39;m too ashamed of
myself to do that.  I had taken advantage of her.  I only thought 
about myself.  But I couldn&#39;t help it, she was so beautiful.  The
way she looked after all that exercising she had finally done, she
looked a lot better, much like me.  I just couldn&#39;t control myself.
I...I...&lt;sniff&gt; had to please myself.  But I took away Nene&#39;s 
innocence in the process.  Oh, God &lt;sob&gt; what have I done????

(Note:  Linna&#39;s now crying uncontrollably when Nene appears.)
&quot;Linna,&quot; I hear through my cries, &quot;what&#39;s wrong?&quot;  I can feel her
warm hand wiping my tears away.

I try to answer through the sorrow, &quot;I...I made you....&quot;

It seems as if Nene knows what I&#39;m about to say, &quot;You what?  No
you didn&#39;t.  You didn&#39;t do anything wrong.  It was I who seduced YOU.&quot;

Of course!  She&#39;s right, SHE made ME make love to her, not the other
way around.  &quot;Why you,&quot; I try to sound angry at her, but it doesn&#39;t 
work.  

Nene is speaking again, &quot;I have another confession to make.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I never had a date to begin with.  I made up the rape story so I
could be with you.  I&#39;m sorry I lied to you.&quot;

I&#39;m a little more angry now.  Why did she have to make a story up?
All she had to do was tell me up front.  &quot;Why did you do that?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; Nene is trying her best to explain now, &quot;...whenever I 
tried to tell you about my feelings, we were either in public, suiting
up, or you&#39;d change the subject.  I didn&#39;t quite know what to do.  
That&#39;s why I made that story up.  I needed to tell you I love you
somehow.&quot;

For some reason, I&#39;m not angry anymore.  In fact, I&#39;m kind of happy
that she said this.  It&#39;ll make it easier on me to confess to her.  
&quot;Nene, I also have a confession.&quot;

&quot;You do?  What is it, you&#39;re not superficial?&quot;  She&#39;s joking now,
I know that tone of voice. 

&quot;Very funny,&quot; I reply with sarcasm.  &quot;No, I too am not who you think
I am.&quot;


&quot;Oh?  How so?&quot;

My true feelings have surfaced.  I feel that I must tell her.  
&quot;Well......to be honest, I did find you attractive, even when you
put on those few pounds.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  Even though I made jokes about it, deep down inside, I did
feel attraction towards you.  I just buried those feelings.  I didn&#39;t 
want to think I was a...a...&quot;

&quot;Lesbian?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it.  I dated guys so I could forget about those feelings. 
It didn&#39;t work, though.  My thoughts about you still surfaced.
The only time I&#39;d ever forget about them is whenever we fought
boomers.&quot;

&quot;So you love me?&quot;

&quot;I guess so.  It took the events yesterday to finally convince me.
Did you know that I thought of you the last time I masturbated?&quot;

&quot;I do now.  I feel much better knowing this.&quot;

&quot;I do too for telling you.  I feel that the whole world is off my
shoulders.&quot;  We embrace in a tight hug.

Something else comes to mind.  &quot;You know, we&#39;re gonna have to
keep this a secret.&quot;


&quot;Why?  I don&#39;t care if people know.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you don&#39;t, but I do.  You know that society doesn&#39;t think
too highly about people like us.  It&#39;s been like this for years.
I don&#39;t know if this will ever change.&quot;

&quot;Okay, but sooner or later, the others will have to know.&quot;

She&#39;s right, they will know eventually.  I don&#39;t think Sylia would
have a problem with it, but Priss will.  I know, I&#39;ve seen her
goof on other lesbians.  If she found out about us....ugh, I
don&#39;t even want to think about it.  &quot;Well,&quot; I say,  &quot;everyone
except for Priss, of course.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t want her to know at all.  You know,&quot; she chuckles,
&quot;I wonder what would happen if Mackie finds out.&quot;

I think about it and laugh, &quot;Yeah, he&#39;ll probably ask if he could
watch us or something.&quot;  We both laugh about that thought.

Anyway, back to reality.  &quot;So remember, this relationship
is to stay a secret until such time as we see fit, got it?&quot;

&quot;All right, I guess so.&quot;  She bends down to kiss me.  I give her
a quick peck on the lips.  I know what she wants, but I don&#39;t
think this is the time.  &quot;Not now,&quot; I say to her, &quot;perhaps later,
okay?  Besides, don&#39;t you have to work today?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m off today,&quot; Nene replies happily.  &quot;I&#39;m just gonna relax
today.  It should be a bit easier now.&quot;

I believe her.  Boomer crimes have gone down quite a bit recently.
People can sleep much easier now.  But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what
Nene was thinking about.  

&quot;I&#39;ll see you later, Linna.&quot;  Nene blows me a kiss before she 
exits.  I sit back and finish reading the paper.  This time, I can
read what&#39;s going on in the world without those regrets.  In fact,
I feel much better knowing of my relationship with Nene, although
we have to be secret lovers for now.  But I don&#39;t care, I just don&#39;t 
care.  I have finally found my true calling, not only in my line of 
work, but in my love life as well.  I know people will disapprove
of it, but let them.  I&#39;m in love with Nene Romanova, dammit, and
I&#39;m proud of it! 

Well, I better get ready for the day.  I wonder what else will
happen to me today.  Hmm, I know of this great place that sells
bondage clothing.  I wonder how Nene and I would look in it....
**********************************************************
Well, that&#39;s it for my fanifc.  I hope you enjoyed it.  
I have an idea, how about emailing me telling me what you 
think?  My address is:

dupontr@river.it.gvsu.edu

Please put &quot;Confessions&quot; in the subject line.

I will accept all criticism except for those that flame me using
profanity.  I will not read them, so don&#39;t waste your time or mine
writing things like that.

Finally, I fell that although this is good, this fic can be better.  
If you have any suggestions on how it could be better, mail me.
I&#39;ll take all into consideration and I may write a revised copy if
I get enough good ones.  Until next time, this is Vermilion.  
So long, everybody!
