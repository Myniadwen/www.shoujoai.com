&quot;Can I just say this is really eerie?&quot; Linna Yamazaki-Chang said, the 
dark brown haired woman gazing at the photos and then looking up at the 
video of the little girl playing in another room of the complex.

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Priss Asagiri agreed, her darker hair still in it&#39;s 
usual ragged style. She had dressed a little more conservative today, 
almost but not quite office lady style in her blue business suit and 
subtle makeup.

&quot;I still can&#39;t get over the idea of Priss having a baby,&quot; Mackey said, 
the young man shaking his head in awe and dismay.

&quot;And the fact that you kept it from us,&quot; Nene added, resentment in her 
voice.

Sylia Stingray smiled wryly, turning to face the group of their friends. 
&quot;We didn&#39;t have much choice,&quot; she explained, &quot;considering it was a 
virgin birth, more or less.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s true then,&quot; Linna&#39;s voice hardened somewhat as she said, &quot;what 
Henderson told me. The child is Galatea?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Nigel said calmly. Everyone waited for him to continue, but the 
scruffy looking engineer kept quiet.

&quot;As our eloquent associate says,&quot; Sylia said to the group wryly, 
&quot;whatever she may be, Sara is not Galatea.&quot;

&quot;How can you be sure?&quot; Nene protested.

&quot;Her physiology is human,&quot; Sylia explained patiently, &quot;not boomeroid, 
and genetically she appears to be a combination of myself and Priss.&quot;

Sounding faintly amused Priss muttered, &quot;For a while there I was sure 
Sylia had managed to knock me up somehow.&quot;

Nene broke into a fit of giggles and poor Mackey nearly choked on a soda 
he was drinking. &quot;So if she isn&#39;t Galatea, then where did Sara come 
from?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Shortly after we recovered Nene, Priss and Linna in the aftermath of 
the battle with Galatea I had all of you given a thorough medical 
examination,&quot; Sylia said crisply, &quot;at that time we found traces of 
boomer cells in your systems.&quot;

&quot;Boomers?&quot; Linna paled.

Before anyone could get more upset Nigel calmly said, &quot;We figured it was 
a side effect of the close bond you all formed with your hardsuits, and 
since your immune systems were killing them off there was no need to 
tell you.&quot;

Before Linna or Nene could think to start yelling at Nigel or Sylia 
Priss cut them both off. &quot;Later,&quot; she told both furious women, &quot;you can 
yell at them to your heart&#39;s content. For now, let&#39;s just finish the 
damn story.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sylia sighed. She rubbed between her eyes, &quot;Somehow the 
cells survived in Priss&#39; biosystem, and sometime after we became 
sexually active together my blood, hers and the boomer cells combined to 
create Sara.&quot;

&quot;So she&#39;s a boomer human hybrid,&quot; Mackey asked for clarification. He 
looked at his sister in confusion, &quot;But you&#39;re certain she&#39;s not 
Galatea?&quot;

&quot;She shows no sign of Galatea&#39;s disruption field or her unique effects 
on boomers,&quot; Sylia explained, &quot;the only unusual thing has been her 
accelerated aging.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s less than a year old but Sara looks five,&quot; Priss rubbed at her 
eyes tiredly, &quot;and her mental development seems about equal.&quot;

&quot;But what if she really is Galatea?&quot; Linna looked around at the others, 
&quot;She could put the entire country in danger.&quot;

&quot;You ready to kill a kid for what she might become?&quot; Nigel asked 
quietly, leaving an long, uncomfortable silence behind.

&quot;Yeah, me too,&quot; Priss sighed. She leaned forward from where she was 
sitting on the couch, &quot;But we&#39;re being as careful as we can.&quot;

&quot;I see you&#39;re monitoring her,&quot; Nene waved to a view screen where a child 
who looked like a silver haired Priss played with a ball.

&quot;I also consider her a second chance,&quot; Sylia added. At everyone&#39;s looks 
she explained, &quot;I&#39;ve often wondered if Galatea might have been a 
different woman if she had a reasonably normal life, rather than being 
imprisoned by my father.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re trying to raise Sara as a normal girl, so that if she really 
is a transformed Galatea...?&quot; Mackey trailed off thoughtfully.

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Priss nodded. &quot;At least Sara will be less vulnerable to 
manipulative bastards,&quot; she said dryly, referring the what Mason had 
done to Galatea.

Once Brian J. Mason had been a rising star in Genom, but he had realized 
that Quincy would always stand in his way. Discovering the existence of 
Galatea he had used her as a clumsy weapon against Quincy, eventually 
leading to a full scale boomer rebellion. In the end Mason won, in a 
way, but his actions ultimately destroyed him.

Linna got up from her seat with a sigh, stretching. &quot;Well, I still can&#39;t 
say I approve,&quot; she said honestly, &quot;but I won&#39;t fight you on this, 
either.&quot; She smiled slightly, &quot;Now if you don&#39;t mind, I think my wife is 
waiting for me.&quot;

Sylia walked her to the door, &quot;Thank you for inviting us to the wedding, 
by the way.&quot; A impish twinkle glowed in her eyes, &quot;I seem to recall you 
were a little startled by the bachelor party I helped your co-workers 
throw you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to know where you found a stripper willing to take off her 
clothes for a woman,&quot; Linna blushed.

&quot;Actually I had a few volunteers after I showed your picture around,&quot; 
Sylia purred.

After a still blushing Linna had left Henderson arrived with the 
portable phone, the older man looking like the model for a perfect 
English butler. &quot;Miss Nene,&quot; he held out the phone, &quot;there&#39;s a urgent 
call for you from AD Police.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on...&quot; Nene moaned out, taking the phone and talking with a 
faintly pained expression on her face.

&quot;What&#39;s that all about?&quot; Priss asked Mackey.

&quot;During the boomer attack on AD Police headquarters Nene was forced to 
use her hacking skills in front of her superiors,&quot; Mackey explained, &quot;it 
impressed them so much that they put her in charge of the new computer 
crimes unit.&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Sylia murmured, already calculating how she could use 
this to their advantage. &quot;Henderson,&quot; she smiled, &quot;could you get us some 
refreshments?&quot;

&quot;Of course, madam,&quot; Henderson nodded and was gone.

&quot;So,&quot; Priss gave Mackey a impish look and asked, &quot;when are you planning 
to make Nene a honest woman?&quot;

&quot;Priss,&quot; Nene squealed angrily, hanging up the phone as her boyfriend 
went beet red.

&quot;I&#39;d like to,&quot; Mackey stammered, &quot;but until we get the body problem 
solved...&quot;

&quot;I asked him to wait,&quot; Sylia agreed as Henderson arrived with drinks. He 
poured, waited to see if there was anything else, then quietly left. 
&quot;There&#39;s a new prototype that looks promising,&quot; she added, &quot;I want to 
test it out before applying the tech to Mackey.&quot;

&quot;Guess I can understand that,&quot; Priss said, studying Mackey with 
sympathy. The man looked like he was in his teens but in reality he was 
as old as Sylia, his boomer-like body unaging from when he had first 
been completed.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Mackey grinned suddenly and asked, &quot;when are Sylia and Nigel 
making you an honest woman?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re thinking about it,&quot; Nigel admitted, taking a pull from the beer 
Henderson had left him.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Nene blinked.

&quot;We haven&#39;t decided if Priss and I do dresses and Nigel in a suit or 
Priss and Nigel wear suits or all three,&quot; Sylia said with a smile.

&quot;Once we get that worked out,&quot; Priss drank from her own beer, &quot;we&#39;ll set 
a date.&quot;
