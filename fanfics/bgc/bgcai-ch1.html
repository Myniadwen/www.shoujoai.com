<pre>&quot;Okay, Linna, you ready?&quot;

&quot;I was born ready, Nene.&quot;

&quot;Popcorn?&quot;

&quot;Check.&quot;

&quot;Soda?&quot;

&quot;Check.&quot;

&quot;Cheesy movies?&quot;

&quot;Double check.&quot;

It was Tuesday evening at Linna&#39;s. Once a week, Linna and Nene got 
together for a game of bad movie night. The rules were simple: you 
picked a bad movie, and tried to get your opponent to give up and admit 
she couldn&#39;t take any more. Last week, Nene had defeated Linna with the 
Japanese dubbed version of the Hulk Hogan comedy &quot;Santa with Muscles&quot;. 
After about forty minutes, Linna was begging Nene to turn it off.

Which was why this week they were at Linna&#39;s, and why she had to spring 
for the refreshments. As challenger, it was also her job to come up with 
the movies.

They made no secret about their little weekly contest. The only friend 
who&#39;d ever agreed to join them was Mackie. After thirty minutes of the 
Japanese subtitled version of &quot;Blacula&quot;, he had jokingly threatened to 
turn himself off and erase his own memory if they didn&#39;t end the movie.

&quot;So, which do you want to see first; &#39;King Kong Escapes&#39; or &#39;Shaft&#39;s Big 
Score?&#39;&quot; Linna asked, teasingly dangling the films in front of Nene.

&quot;Well, I...&quot; Nene was cut off by a knock at the door. Linna got up to 
answer it.

&quot;Who is it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s me. Priss. Can I... can I come in?&quot;

Linna noticed something in Priss&#39; voice. She looked over at Nene, whose 
look of concern showed she too was aware of something wrong. She opened 
the door, and saw Priss in the hallway shaking, her eyes red and puffy 
from crying.

&quot;Priss...&quot; Linna gasped.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I um... man this is hard, I know this is your gals&#39; night 
out and all but, um... but see me and Leon, we... I told him I wasn&#39;t 
interested in him... in him as more than a friend, and... and he, um, 
didn&#39;t take it too good.&quot;

Linna was worried by her friend&#39;s demeanor. She&#39;d never seen Priss this 
shaken before. It wasn&#39;t like her at all. Whatever had gone down must&#39;ve 
been pretty bad.

&quot;He didn&#39;t do anything to you, did he?&quot;

&quot;What? No, of course not. But... but he said, he called me... oh, damn.&quot; 
she angrily said as the tears started to flow again. Linna pulled her 
over into a hug. To her surprise, Priss didn&#39;t try to resist. Nene, 
overhearing the conversation, came out in the hallway and hugged her 
too.

&quot;I just... I know I should be stronger than this, but I could really use 
some company right now. Heh, can you believe it? *I* need company.&quot; she 
said bitterly. &quot;I tried Nene&#39;s, but you two weren&#39;t there.&quot;

&quot;Come on in.&quot; Nene said, gently leading Priss into Linna&#39;s apartment by 
the arm. &quot;That mean old Leon Peon! I don&#39;t know what he said to you, but 
when I see him again I&#39;m going to give him a piece of my mind!&quot;

Linna followed them in, shutting the door behind her.

&quot;Oh man, look at me. I&#39;m a mess. Is there someplace I can freshen up a 
bit?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, use Linna&#39;s bathroom. It&#39;s in there. Just go into her bedroom, 
and it&#39;ll be the first door on your left.&quot;

Linna suddenly got a sinking feeling. The bedroom? What if Priss saw it? 
Hell, how could she not? It was right on top of the dresser next to the 
bathroom door. She normally hid it when she had guests, but she now 
realized she&#39;d forgotten to tonight. She wished at that moment she could 
crawl under a rock.

&quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Priss said.

She turned the bedroom light on and found her way to the bathroom. She 
splashed her face with cold water, trying to forget the night. Leon 
wouldn&#39;t buy the &quot;Lets just be friends&quot; line Priss had used on him. He&#39;d 
attacked her music, her clothes, her lifestyle, and had called her just 
about every four letter word in the book. He&#39;d felt betrayed after 
waiting for her, he&#39;d felt like he&#39;d been played for a fool, and he let 
her know it.

Priss came out of the bathroom and accidentally knocked over a picture 
on the dresser to her left. She picked it up to straighten it, when she 
noticed what it was a picture of.

She remembered the bet with Sylia. She also remembered the humiliation 
at the time of having to wear the dress. As she was looking at the 
photo, she noticed something was written on it.

Priss-chan,

Ai shite&#39;ru yo (I love you).

Linna

Priss froze. There were several words to express love in Japanese. There 
was &quot;koi&quot;, or sexual love. There was &quot;suki&quot;, to like. There was 
&quot;daisuki&quot;, to really like.

Then there was &quot;ai.&quot;

&quot;Ai&quot; was the Japanese equivalent of the Greek word &quot;agape&quot;, or spiritual 
love. It was not a word to be taken lightly. It was the deepest, most 
heartfelt form of romantic love one human being could feel for another, 
and Linna felt it toward her.

&quot;Linna,&quot; she whispered, &quot;why didn&#39;t you ever tell me?&quot;

&quot;Hey, you done in there yet?&quot; Nene yelled.

Priss quickly pulled herself together. &quot;Yeah, coming.&quot;

She came in and sat on the couch to Nene&#39;s right, with Linna nervously 
sitting on Nene&#39;s left side. Linna&#39;s knees were shaking. She just knew 
Priss was going to pick on her, or worse.

What she didn&#39;t expect was that Priss would make no mention of the photo 
whatsoever.

&quot;So, what kinds of atrocities do you to have lined up for tonight?&quot; 
Priss asked her fellow Knight Sabers. Nene showed her Linna&#39;s picks, and 
she made a face.

&quot;Yikes, no wonder Mackie dropped out of your little group.&quot;

---Forty Minutes Later---

Linna was finally beginning to relax. Priss obviously hadn&#39;t seen the 
photo, or she would&#39;ve said something long before now. &quot;Good grief, I&#39;ve 
seen better acting in car commercials!&quot; she joked, getting a laugh out 
of her two companions.

&quot;Yeah, and why is it the villain&#39;s upper teeth are perfect, but his 
bottom ones are all crooked and nasty looking?&quot; Nene asked.

&quot;I&#39;m still trying to figure out why they&#39;d give Japanese facial features 
to a giant gorilla.&quot; Priss said, joining in on the fun.

Linna looked over past Nene, and smiled. &quot;Feeling a bit better, Priss?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, actually. In fact, I think I&#39;m feeling better than I have in a 
long time.&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; Nene said cheerfully, then more seriously, &quot;Ooh, that mean old 
grouch Leon! He has no right to make one of my friends cry.&quot;

&quot;Nene, it&#39;s all right. Really.&quot;

&quot;Priss,&quot; Linna asked a bit hesitantly, &quot;I realize it&#39;s none of my 
business, but why did you dump Leon?&quot;

Priss shrugged her shoulders, &quot;I guess I realized I had feelings for 
someone else.&quot;

&quot;Wow, really?&quot; Nene asked, &quot;Who is he?&quot;

Priss looked down at the bowl of popcorn in Nene&#39;s lap. &quot;It&#39;s not a he.&quot; 
she said, grabbing some popped kernels and popping them into her mouth.

Both Linna and Nene&#39;s jaws dropped. Priss stared straight ahead at the 
TV screen, trying to avoid eye contact with either of them.

&quot;Wait, you... for a... that would make you a...&quot; Nene stuttered. Priss 
nodded her head, and Nene sweat dropped. She already suspected Linna 
might be a Lesbian, and had said as much to Sylia at a meeting not long 
ago. But now, to be sitting between a suspected lesbian and someone 
who&#39;d just come out of the closet...

&quot;I see,&quot; Linna said, &quot;so you told Leon this?&quot;

&quot;No. Just that I didn&#39;t feel anything for him. I&#39;ll be honest; I&#39;m 
confused here. I&#39;ve never felt this way for another girl before. And 
feeling this way, I knew I&#39;d be leading Leon on if I continued seeing 
him when I had feelings for another, especially for someone of my own 
sex.&quot;

&quot;So, have you asked this other girl out yet?&quot; Nene asked as the gossip 
in her temporarily overpowered her discomfort at the seating 
arrangement.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;No? You mean you dumped Leon poo for someone you haven&#39;t asked out 
yet?&quot;

&quot;I was afraid of what might happen if she found out how I felt and 
didn&#39;t feel the same way. I didn&#39;t want to loose her as a friend. But 
now...&quot;

&quot;Now, what?&quot; Linna asked, a spark of jealousy kindling in her as she 
wondered who Priss could possibly have a crush on. &#39;Why,&#39; she asked 
herself, &#39;Do I have to be such a country girl and so average looking?&#39;

&quot;Now I&#39;ve found out she has feelings for me too.&quot;

Linna quickly turned her head again in Priss&#39; direction. She was trying 
desperately not to get her hopes up. Priss was completely out of her 
league, and she knew it.

&quot;Priss,&quot; Nene said, &quot;I don&#39;t know anything about, you know, but if you 
have feelings for her, and she has feelings for you, you&#39;d better say 
something quick, or you may loose her.&quot;

&quot;You think so?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah. I had a friend back in school who was interested in this guy 
but didn&#39;t say anything because she was shy and didn&#39;t think he was 
interested in her. Well anyway she later found out he was but by that 
point he&#39;d given up and was dating someone else who was on the 
cheerleader squad I think and...&quot;

&quot;How do you do that?&quot;

&quot;Do what?&quot;

&quot;Talk that fast for that long without taking a breath.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well I don&#39;t know I guess it&#39;s just a skill I picked up over the 
years. Kind of like hacking but not quite the same since...&quot;

&quot;*Nene!*&quot; Linna yelled, causing the youngest Knight Saber to almost jump 
out of her skin. Priss was looking at her funny now, which caused her to 
blush furiously.

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry. Nene&#39;s right, though.&quot; She said, intentionally avoiding 
Priss&#39; eyes, &quot;If you like this person, you should...&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s a little more than like.&quot;

Finally, Nene couldn&#39;t take it any longer. &quot;Priss, who is it you have a 
crush on?&quot; she asked just before taking a swig of her soda.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Linna said, unable to take the suspense either, &quot;is it someone 
we know?&quot;

Priss leaned behind Nene to look at Linna.

&quot;It&#39;s you.&quot; she said. Nene proceeded to choke on her drink.

Linna looked over, dumbfounded. She couldn&#39;t believe this was really 
happening. A wave of warmth surged through her. It was just like she&#39;d 
always imagined.

Except that Nene was there with soda running out her nose.

And they were watching &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;.

&quot;Ummm, guys...&quot; Nene said, finally able to speak again and once again 
feeling very uncomfortable about being seated between Priss and Linna.

&quot;Priss, I...&quot;

&quot;Ai shite&#39;ru yo.&quot; Priss said, staring straight into her friend&#39;s eyes.

The room suddenly became very quiet.

&quot;Guys...&quot; Nene nervously said again.

&quot;Priss...&quot;

&quot;Linna...&quot;

&quot;*Whoa look at the time!*&quot; Nene practically shrieked as she bolted up 
off the couch. &quot;Gee, I&#39;ve got to go, big day and all tomorrow. Besides, 
I have to get home and call the cat to see if they got my mom out of the 
tree yet, I mean... uh... bye!&quot; she said as she ran to the closet, 
grabbed her coat, and ran out the apartment door, stopping just long 
enough to collect her shoes on the way out.

&quot;So...&quot;

&quot;So...&quot;

&quot;You really dumped him because you had feelings for me?&quot; Linna said, 
still not believing this was really happening.

Priss nodded. &quot;Have for a while now. I never said anything though 
because, well, like I said, I&#39;ve never felt this way for another girl 
before, and...&quot;

&quot;And?&quot; Linna prodded. She had never seen this more vulnerable side of 
Priss before. It was obviously a part of herself she&#39;d shared with very 
few people.

&quot;And you came from a good family out in the country while I grew up on 
the streets trying to survive day to day. I guess I...&quot; she looked down 
at her hands, &quot;I guess I didn&#39;t think I was good enough for someone like 
you.&quot; she said sadly.

Linna moved over to where Priss was sitting. She put her hand to Priss&#39; 
cheek and turned her head so she was facing her. She then moved in and 
kissed her on the lips, tentatively pressing her tongue against Priss&#39; 
lips. Priss could feel her heart beat faster as she opened her mouth and 
returned the kiss; hesitantly at first, then more assertively as she put 
her arms around her and pulled her in closer. They each tasted the 
buttered popcorn in each others mouths and on each other&#39;s tongues. 
Priss finally broke away from the kiss.

&quot;Did you really mean what you wrote on that picture?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Did you really mean what you said before Nene left?&quot;

&quot;With all my heart.&quot; she said as she moved in again. Priss suddenly 
became aware of Linna&#39;s right hand on her left breast. She decided to 
return the favor by slowly maneuvering her hands up Linna&#39;s shirt. Now 
it was Linna&#39;s turn to break off the kiss.

&quot;Priss-chan,&quot; she gasped, &quot;Before we go any further, would you... would 
you be comfortable with going into the bedroom? This couch isn&#39;t the 
most comfortable thing to make out on, you know.&quot;

Priss became nervous. This was the first time she&#39;d ever made out with a 
girl before, and to suddenly be invited into the bedroom was a bit 
daunting. She looked into Linna&#39;s eyes, though, and suddenly felt 
herself more at ease. From the look on her face, Linna was just as 
nervous as she was.

&quot;Okay. But just keep in mind; this is still kind of new to me.&quot;

&quot;Of course. It&#39;s kind of new to me too, you know. It&#39;s not like I had 
access to any lesbian bars out in the country, you know.&quot;

They both laughed at that. As they got up, Priss looked over at Linna a 
bit mischievously.

&quot;You know,&quot; she began, &quot;Nene left before the end of the film.&quot;

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s right.&quot; Linna said, shutting the bedroom door behind her. 
&quot;He he, I won! Cool. Thanks Priss.&quot;

&quot;Anytime.&quot; She said, reaching over to turn off the light.
