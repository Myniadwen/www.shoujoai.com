<a href="../bgc/sensabers-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>&quot;Miss Mizuno, it&#39;s good to see you again,&quot; Kaori
Knight nodded in greeting, the redhead calmly waiting
to escort Ami to her boss. She stood there in the
reception area of Infinity Tower, the massive
structure bustling twenty four hours a day with
scientists, researchers, manufacturing and of course
security staff to keep the occupants safe.

&quot;Ms. Knight,&quot; Ami nodded back, the blue haired young
woman having changed her clothes to a severe looking
business suit. Combined with subtle traces of makeup
and her serious expression she made a surprisingly
intimidating figure there in the Infinity Tower.

Kaori lead her through the lobby then over to the lift
and they soon were rising smoothly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for how
quickly we called you here,&quot; she said to Ami
respectfully, &quot;but I believe it&#39;s a matter of some
urgency.&quot;

&quot;Can you explain?&quot; Ami asked as they rode.

&quot;I&#39;d rather wait for Miss Tomoe,&quot; Kaori sounded gently
apologetic, &quot;she has a personal stake in this
discussion.&quot;

That surprised Ami a bit, &quot;Ah.&quot;

They reached the penthouse level a few moments later,
Kaori leading Ami right into the main office on that
floor. Hotaru Tomoe looked up from a data-screen on
her desk, black hair framing her delicate face as she
nodded, &quot;Welcome.&quot;

&quot;Miss Tomoe,&quot; Ami answered, taking a seat before the
desk. She narrowed her eyes slightly, &quot;May I ask what
was so urgent as to require a personal meeting?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s complicated,&quot; Hotaru admitted quietly.

Ami felt like she was flying as her mind made the
sudden leap. &quot;Mistress Nine?&quot; she asked softly,
studying Hotaru thoughtfully.

Hotaru smiled slightly, but it was an almost humorless
expression. &quot;Your information network is as good as
reported,&quot; she noted quietly, &quot;how did you know?&quot;

Ami decided to stick with half truths, since complete
honesty wasn&#39;t wise just yet. &quot;A rogue Bio-boomer
mentioned the name while in combat with the Senshi
Sabers,&quot; Ami said calmly, &quot;and a source of mine
mentioned it as well.&quot;

&#39;And you&#39;re not going to admit you heard the name
first hand, will you?&#39; Hotaru thought with grim
amusement. &quot;Yes, the problem is Mistress Nine,&quot; Hotaru
confirmed, &quot;she&#39;s a prototype Bio-boomer who
apparently escaped containment some time ago.&quot;

&quot;Containment?&quot; Ami leaned forward.

&quot;Mistress Nine has unusual abilities in addition to
her greatly advanced strength,&quot; Hotaru got up from her
chair and looked out at the city below, &quot;she can
disrupt both human and Bio-boomer flesh, as well as
driving nearby Bio-boomers insane.&quot;

&quot;Is she the cause of rogue Bio-boomers?&quot; Ami asked
intently.

&quot;Not the only cause,&quot; Hotaru sighed, &quot;most of it is a
flaw in my fathers design. But I think Nine has
triggered the rapid rise in failures recently.&quot;

&quot;What can I do to help?&quot; Ami asked mildly.

Hotaru smiled, feeling amused by this whole odd dance
they were doing. Ami seemed unwilling to concede her
connection to the Senshi Sabers outright, and she felt
bound by tact not to force the issue. &#39;At least not
yet,&#39; she added mentally. &quot;I understand you can
contact the Senshi Sabers,&quot; she said aloud.

&quot;I have been in touch with them at times,&quot; Ami nodded
mildly.

Hotaru produced a data disk from the top of her desk
and carried it over to Ami. &quot;This is whatever archival
data we have on Nine&#39;s creation and activities,&quot; she
handed it over, &quot;please pass it on to them, please.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that.&quot; Ami took it.

Hotaru looked at her thoughtfully a moment, &quot;You may
not be aware, but there were three prototypes created
before Nine.&quot; Silently she added, &#39;And myself, of
course.&#39;

&quot;Really,&quot; Ami said brightly, eyes nearly perfectly
innocent.

&#39;No one looks that innocent unless they&#39;re hiding
something,&#39; Hotaru hid a chuckle. &quot;They were
designated Pluto, Uranus and Neptune in the files
belonging to your mother,&quot; she revealed, &quot;finding them
could be vital to stopping Nine.&quot;

Ami nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll pass them on, too.&quot; She got up,
tucking the disk away as she said crisply, &quot;Thank you,
Hotaru.&quot;

A few minutes later Ami was gone and Kaori rejoined
Hotaru in the office, looking on with concern as her
employer slumped tiredly. &quot;Are you all right, ma&#39;am?&quot;
Kaori asked softly.

&quot;Just vaguely frustrated,&quot; Hotaru admitted, running a
hand through her black hair. The pale young woman
smiled wryly, &quot;I can understand Ami&#39;s reluctance to
open up, in her shoes I&#39;d feel the same way, but it
makes the situation even more difficult.&quot;

&quot;There are other options,&quot; Kaori offered softly, &quot;we
could mobilize corporate security or the AD Police
against Nine when the time comes.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Hotaru sighed, &quot;they&#39;d be slaughtered. I have
enough blood on my hands without adding innocents to
the list.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Kaori protested, laying her hand gently on
Hotaru&#39;s arm.

Hotaru gave her a gentle smile, patting that hand
absentmindedly. &quot;I just wish I knew what Nine was
doing...&quot; she sighed.

Ami Mizuno was thinking much the same as she strode
into her store, nodding to the departing staff. Thank
you for closing up Catsy,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I didn&#39;t
expect to be gone so long.&quot;

The purple haired girl smiled back warmly as Catsy
said, &quot;It&#39;s all right, ma&#39;am. Did you have a good
evening?&quot;

&quot;Business meeting,&quot; Ami shrugged, &quot;it went fine.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Catsy excused herself, &quot;I hope you have a good
night.&quot;

Without thinking about it Ami strode through the store
checking things over before entering the concealed
lift, descending smoothly bellow the Silky Doll. She
made her way to the office and command center she had
created years ago and sat down behind her desk with a
relieved sigh.

After a moment&#39;s rest Ami went to work, setting up her
computer for it&#39;s upcoming task. Quite deliberately
she severed it from her internal system and shut down
all it&#39;s outgoing connections as a security precaution
before putting Tomoe&#39;s disk inside.

&quot;Always better to be safe than sorry,&quot; Ami muttered to
herself as she accessed the directories within by a
click of her mouse.

After a second a video file came up, labeled
Mizuno-25. A click opened it and a face very like
Ami&#39;s own appeared, her expression tired but oddly
satisfied. &quot;The planet series of prototypes are
finally done,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;the bridge between
Tomoe&#39;s crude Bio-boomers and humanity. I hope with
their aide humanity and Bio-boomers can coexist
safely.&quot;

Ami paused the image to study her mother&#39;s face,
feeling an ace of regret. &quot;Mother,&quot; she sighed, &quot;you
were so naive.&quot;

Another file was labeled Tomoe-25, and curious Ami
opened it. &quot;Mizuno has done it,&quot; Tomoe said, his round
glasses gleaming as he gestured wildly in his long
white lab coat, &quot;she&#39;s made me the perfect husks. Now
I just have to replicate the basic design and download
Hotaru&#39;s memory-data onto the blank creation...&quot;

Another file, Tomoe-27. &quot;Mizuno is fighting me over
the Planet series,&quot; Tomoe said coldly, &quot;it&#39;s a
difficult situation. I clearly own the original
Bio-boomer, but Mizuno&#39;s advances could be argued to
be her original intellectual property. Mizuno could
slow or even stop the resurrection unless I&#39;m prepared
to take the needed steps.&quot;

&quot;Bastard,&quot; Ami growled in uncharacteristic anger. From
the date and time stamps it was shortly after that he
had arranged for Mizuno&#39;s murder, the false accident
to steal the research he needed. She still couldn&#39;t
understand how he could do that, kill for an ambition
no matter how noble he thought it was.</pre>
