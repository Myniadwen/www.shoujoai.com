Priss woke up and reached over next to her to where Linna had been 
sleeping, but she wasn&#39;t there. She looked around the room at the 
recently cleaned walls and found where Linna had left the mat she&#39;d 
slept on. It was rolled up and placed in the corner. She closed her eyes 
again to... 

Recently cleaned walls? 

She opened her eyes and looked around. All the dirty clothes she&#39;d left 
lying around were gone, and the floors and walls had been cleaned 
immaculate. She got up and walked outside. Linna had swept the stone 
path leading from the house Priss&#39; mother had left her to the road, and 
her dirty clothes were hanging by a line as they drip-dried after having 
been cleaned in a nearby stream. She&#39;d also cleaned the outside of the 
house, and left a small cone of salt outside the entrance. 

&quot;Damn it, what&#39;s that crazy geisha up to now?&quot; She mumbled sleepily. As 
she went back inside, she could hear someone whistling a happy little 
tune. 

In the kitchen, Linna was lovingly preparing breakfast for herself and 
Priss. A typical Japanese breakfast of rice and miso soup was out of the 
question, as she didn&#39;t have access to the ingredients for the soup. She 
was able to make the rice, however. Having woken at the crack of dawn, 
she thought about the previous night she&#39;d shared with Priss. She didn&#39;t 
think she&#39;d ever been happier in her life. Last night, for the first 
time, she had shared her body with another person. Priss had been so 
tender, so passionate. It was a side of her the former geisha never 
would&#39;ve guessed existed. As a result, the affection Linna had felt for 
her had bloomed into something much more profound 

&quot;Linna?&quot; Priss asked, &quot;Linna, what is all this?&quot; 

&quot;All of what, Priss-chan?&quot; she asked, a bit surprised at Priss&#39; tone.

&quot;The path, the salt, the cleaning, the... chan?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I got up at sunrise, and since you were still asleep and I had 
nothing else to do, I thought I might as well help out a little around 
the house.&quot; 

&quot;I see.&quot; she said, a bit taken aback. She had told Linna not to push 
her, and here she was practically moved in. 

&quot;Oh, and the pillar of salt is for purification.&quot; 

&quot;Purification?&quot; 

&quot;Hai. Back at the okiya where I grew up, we used to leave a small cone 
of salt like that outside the building every morning.&quot; she then looked 
at Priss &quot;Are you hungry?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I guess I am a bit. But I can get myself something. You don&#39;t 
have to...&quot; 

&quot;Are you sure, Priss-chan? It&#39;d be no trouble to...&quot; 

&quot;And stop calling me chan.&quot; 

&quot;What? Why?&quot; Linna asked. For Priss to act so coldly to her and to 
withdraw to the point where she refused to allow her to call her by the 
affectionate term chan, both confused and hurt her deeply. Why would she 
be acting like this? 

&quot;Sylia used to call me chan. I&#39;m not comfortable with another calling me 
that.&quot; 

Linna looked at her silently as she thought about that. &quot;Did your 
relationship with her mean that much to you?&quot; 

Priss regarded the geisha in front of her, particularly the hurt tone in 
her voice. Damn it, why was Linna insisting on making everything so 
complicated? 

&quot;What I had with Sylia is between me and her, so drop it!&quot; she said, 
immediately wishing she hadn&#39;t raised her voice as Linna turned away. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I...&quot; 

Linna was no longer listening. She now knew what was wrong. Inside, she 
felt a little piece of herself die. 

&quot;You still love her, don&#39;t you?&quot; she asked in a low tone of voice. 

&quot;Whoa, now hold on a second. That&#39;s not true, I...&quot; 

&quot;She hurt you terribly,&quot; she said, her tone of voice betraying nothing 
of the emotional turmoil she was going through, &quot;So you&#39;ve tried to hurt 
her back in various ways, but you still love her. You wouldn&#39;t be so 
upset now, or so insistent I not call you chan otherwise.&quot; 

Priss wasn&#39;t sure what to say to that. As she was searching for a 
response, Linna placed the rice she&#39;d made into a bowl, and turned back 
to her. 

&quot;I&#39;m not Sylia, Priss, and I never will be. I... I love you, but I won&#39;t 
share you with a ghost from the past.&quot; she said, trying to keep the 
bitterness out of her voice. 

&quot;Linna, you don&#39;t understand...&quot; 

&quot;Here, you take this, I&#39;m not very hungry anymore.&quot; she said, as she 
passed the bowl of rice to Priss. &quot;I&#39;ll see you this evening at four 
over at sensei&#39;s store.&quot; she said, just before rushing out. 

&quot;Linna, wait.&quot; 

But it was too late. She had already left. 

---3:00 PM---

Brian J. Mason watched impatiently as the scenery went by. He&#39;d been 
traveling for close to forty minutes, going over and over again in his 
head the offer he was about to make. 

&quot;Kirkland Stables, Mr. Mason.&quot; the coachman yelled to him. As the coach 
stopped, he grabbed his stove pipe hat and exited with two members of 
the yakuza.  

Inside the house adjacent to the stables, Nigel was watching the new 
arrivals. Mackie, who Sylia had sent over on the pretext of checking up 
on her horses (in reality to get him away from the Silky Doll so the 
Knight Sabers could ride out that evening), was reading when he 
overheard Nigel take in a large gasp of air. 

&quot;Nigel? Nigel, is anything...&quot; 

&quot;Mackie, stay inside the house.&quot; 

&quot;What? Nigel, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; 

&quot;Look, kid, just stay inside and don&#39;t ask so many questions. And no 
matter what you see, don&#39;t come out.&quot; 

&quot;Ummm... O... Okay.&quot; 

Mason had his two men stay by the coach as he strode up to the house, 
holding his hat down with one hand while he carried his cane in the 
other. As he got closer, he stopped when the front door opened and a 
tall Japanese man, dressed in traditional dark hakama pants with a plain 
white kimono tucked into them slowly started coming toward him. He 
noticed the man had his long hair pulled back into a ponytail and was 
smoking a cigarette. As he got closer, Mason realized he wasn&#39;t Japanese 
at all. He began to chuckle. 

&quot;Nigel? Nigel, it&#39;s good to see you again, but this?&quot; he said, smiling 
as he pointed at Kirkland&#39;s choice of attire, &quot;I never would&#39;ve thought 
you&#39;d go native.&quot; 

&quot;What do you want, Mason?&quot; Nigel asked coldly. 

&quot;Mason? My, we are being formal. Time was when we were on first name 
basis. You, me, and Steven were...&quot; 

&quot;Dr. Steven Stingray is dead, you black-balling bastard. Now tell me 
what you want, or get out.&quot; 

&quot;I see... Very well, Kirkland, I think we both know why I&#39;m here.&quot; 

&quot;I won&#39;t talk. You can kill me if you want, but...&quot; 

&quot;Oh please. Drop the martyr act and stop being so naively old 
fashioned.&quot;

&quot;Come again?&quot; 

&quot;You know what your problem is, Kirkland? You want to be a hero.&quot; 

&quot;Heh, really? That&#39;s my problem? I want to be a hero? You traveled all 
the way to Japan to tell me that? Thanks. Now that you&#39;ve explained that 
to me, I guess we can go another thirteen years without seeing each 
other again, huh?&quot; 

Mason frowned. Nigel was apparently determined to be obnoxious. Still, 
he&#39;d come to give his sales pitch, and he&#39;d be damned if he was going to 
let Nigel&#39;s boorish behavior get in the way. 

&quot;Yes, Kirkland. You want to be a hero. The problem, of course, is that 
heroism is now an anachronism. We live in the age of telephones, 
telegraphs, steamships and railroads. Time is leaving you behind. You, 
the naturalists, the underdeveloped lands, and those night warriors or 
whatever the hell you call them. The age of heroes is over. There is no 
Sir Galahad, no dragons left to slay, and no fair damsels left to save. 
This is the industrial age; the age of man, the age of the machine. The 
future belongs to... now what is it the newspapers in the States call us 
again? Oh yes, the robber barons.&quot;  

&quot;So you say.&quot; he answered coldly. 

&quot;Damn it, Kirkland, think! What is personal heroism in the face of 
cannons, repeater riffles, or the gatling? Or... In the face of Dr. 
Stingray&#39;s...&quot; 

&quot;Hmmm... I was wondering when we&#39;d get around to Stingray&#39;s invention.&quot; 

&quot;Listen to me, will you? Very soon, certain events are going to take 
place, events which will make it rather dangerous to be a European here 
in Japan.&quot; 

&quot;Really? Tell me more, you fascinate me.&quot; Nigel said sarcastically. 

&quot;You know where Stingray&#39;s gun is, don&#39;t deny it. We want it. I want it. 
Genom International, in return for the gun and Stingray&#39;s papers, will 
see to your personal safety, and see you back safely to Europe if that 
is what you so desire.&quot; 

&quot;If it becomes dangerous for me, I&#39;ll deal with it when the time comes. 
And if I die, at least I&#39;ll have died taking Dr. Stingray&#39;s secrets with 
me.&quot; 

&quot;So we&#39;re back to Saint Nigel Kirkland, Martyr? Be reasonable. There are 
no Saint Stephens anymore, no saint Ignatius. Martyrdom doesn&#39;t pay 
well. Genom does. Very well, in fact. And when the time comes, you&#39;ll 
come to me, to us.&quot; 

&quot;Get off my property, Mason. And take your goons with you.&quot; 

Nigel waited until he saw the coach go over the hill, then turned around 
and went back inside. 

Back in the coach, Mason was quietly seething at his treatment by Nigel. 
Finally bringing his temper under control, he turned to the yakuza in 
the coach with him.

&quot;Well that didn&#39;t bode too well. Any word yet from our spies?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mason-sama. She is here just as you guessed. She runs a women&#39;s 
clothing store called the Silky Doll.&quot;

&quot;Good work. We got nowhere with the good doctor&#39;s former partner, 
perhaps we&#39;ll have better luck with his daughter.&quot;

---7:30 PM---

The crowded streets of the Kiyosumi-Shirakawa district were slowly 
emptying, as vendors began closing up shop in the evening&#39;s sunset. As 
the beginnings of a chant from the nearby Buddhist temple began, they 
first heard it; the sounds of marching and of drums. As those still in 
the street turned south to where the noise was coming from, they saw a 
large group of armed British soldiers slowly marching toward them. 
Thinking a parade was occurring, men and women began coming out of their 
homes to see.

That&#39;s when the soldiers in the front opened fire on the crowd.

&quot;Death to the Orientals!&quot;  the men disguised as British troops began to 
yell. Those closest to the troops fell like dominoes as those behind 
them started running for cover.

&quot;Kill them all!&quot; their leader shouted. &quot;Kill...&quot; he was cut off by an 
arrow going through his throat. 

&quot;It&#39;s those damn Knight Sabers!&quot; one of the men yelled, as the troops 
quickly let off another volley into the terror stricken crowd. 
Pandemonium began to set in, as people began to trample each other to 
get away. 

Arrows now began to rain down on the fake soldiers, as Priss charged in 
swinging madly at anything her blade could come into contact with. Sylia 
began throwing smoke bombs and lit sticks of dynamite at them. The 
troops now found themselves the scared and confused ones, as explosions 
broke up their ranks.

&quot;Come on, damn it! There&#39;s only three of them, you stupid... Holy shit!&quot; 
he shouted as he saw a new figure in green armor charging towards him.

Linna, now entering her first battle as a Knight Saber, pushed her steed 
to a full gallop. Once her horse was up to speed, she realized 
something; Sylia had never taken the time to teach her how to ride a 
horse. She could get it to charge easily enough, but had no idea how to 
stop it.

There was no time to worry, however, as the chaos around her grew. She 
gripped as hard as she could with her legs as she took the reigns and, 
raising her faceplate, bit down on them with her teeth. Her hands now 
free, she reached behind her to the two swords in the sheaths strapped 
to her back. As bullets and arrows whizzed around her, she drove her 
horse forward with her heels, her hands each now wielding the deadly 
blades.&quot;

&quot;Shit! There&#39;s a fourth one!&quot;

&quot;What the...&quot;

Slicing and stabbing at all around her, she looked over to her left at 
some people crowded into an alley.

&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; she yelled, the reigns falling from her 
mouth, &quot;Run!&quot;

In another part of the battle, Nene looked about ten meters to her 
right, to see a young three year old girl, separated from her parents 
and crying out of fear. She quickly got off her horse and ran to the 
child. Grabbing her, she began to run back to her steed, only to see the 
horse gunned down by a group of the soldiers.

&quot;Oh shit.&quot; She gasped, finding herself stranded. 

------

Emperor Meiji walked down the long corridor, feeling greatly disturbed. 

At first he thought he&#39;d just been imagining things, but not any more. 
Day by day, his personnel and staff were slowly changing. New and 
unfamiliar faces were meeting him in every corner of the palace. As he 
was brooding on the changes, his eyes met a familiar face.

When Emperor Meiji had ascended to the throne and the shogun had stepped 
down from power, only about one-sixth of Japan reverted to imperial 
control. The rest was held onto by the feudal lords known as the daimyo. 
There had been two hundred and seventy-six daimyo, each exercising his 
own rights of legislature over his domains, each commanding his own 
samurai, and some even having their own navies. In the slow, painful 
transition from feudal agricultural society to industrialized 
constitutional monarchy, some daimyo, seeing the writing on the wall, 
stepped down gracefully. Some, reluctantly. Some only giving up their 
titles by forced coercion.

Then there was this man who was now bowing before the emperor in the 
hall leading to his conference chamber.

Kiyoshi was quite possibly the wickedest individual the Emperor had ever 
met. He taxed his peasants into poverty, and had his way with the young 
girls unlucky enough to be born in his lands. When the time came to give 
up his property rights to the young Emperor, the daimyo actually had the 
nerve to join in a plot to assassinate him. Begging mercy of the Emperor 
once the plot was uncovered, Meiji had banished him, not just from his 
sight, but from all of Japan.

So what was Kiyoshi now doing here in the Imperial Palace? Among all 
the... unfamiliar faces?

&quot;Raidon, Masazaku,&quot; the Emperor called to his two advisors, &quot;follow me.&quot;

The two men whose advice Emperor Meiji trusted most followed him quickly 
into the conference room.

&quot;My Emperor, what&#39;s wrong.&quot; Raidon asked.

&quot;Gentleman,&quot; the Emperor began, &quot;I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re all in great danger.&quot;

------

Nene ran as fast as she could, the small girl screaming in fear as she 
clung onto the pink Knight Saber. Behind and around her, bullets flew. 
Reaching into a compartment in her armor with her right hand as she held 
the child with her left, she withdrew a shuriken, throwing it at the 
nearest trooper.

&quot;Aaaa! My fuckin&#39; shoulder!&quot; he yelled, as he dropped his riffle. Nene, 
not stopping to admire her handiwork, began to think back to her 
childhood growing up a member of the Russian Orthodox Church.

&quot;Theotokos (Orthodox title given to Mary), help me!&quot; she screamed in 
Russian. As she looked up, she saw Linna, her armor covered in the blood 
of the fallen, quickly reaching back to sheath one of her swords. 
Reaching out, she grabbed hold of Nene, and swung her and the girl onto 
the horse behind her. She then somehow managed to turn the horse around 
and galloped away from the soldiers.

In another part of the square, Sylia placed herself between a group of 
civilians and four of the heavily armed soldiers. Seeing the woman in 
her samurai armor, they began to laugh. There were four of them, and one 
of her. As she sheathed her sword, they thought she was going to 
surrender.

Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t notice her armor had gun holsters at each 
hip. She beat them to the draw, dropping the four of them before they 
could even aim. She then turned back to the scared people behind her.

&quot;Find cover, now!&quot; she ordered.

Elsewhere, Priss was in the heat of the battle, but her mind was 
elsewhere. Why couldn&#39;t Linna understand? That term of affection, chan, 
held nothing but pain for her. That and love. You tell someone you love 
them, or they tell you they love you, and it&#39;s all downhill from there. 
Why in the hell would that damn stupid geisha think she still loved 
Sylia? The whole idea was stupid.

Wasn&#39;t it?

She shook herself out of it as she saw Linna riding at full speed with 
Nene and a small child clutching onto her from behind ride past her. As 
she watched her racing her steed, she realized two things; she had to do 
something quickly, or she was going to loose her, and she couldn&#39;t bring 
herself to imagine not having Linna with her. 

The sound of a trumpet announced that the real British troops had 
arrived. Linna was able by some means to get her horse to stop, as Nene 
passed the girl down to a group of locals hiding behind a statue.

&quot;Good grief, Linna. The way you rode this thing, a person would think 
you&#39;d never been on a horse before.&quot;

&quot;Well, now that you mention it...&quot;

&quot;Fall out!&quot; Sylia called, as both she and Priss now rode by them. The 
British troops now engaged the fake soldiers in battle, much to the 
confusion of the native population. As they rode off into the darkness, 
Linna tried to tally in her mind the number of men she&#39;d just killed, 
and felt sick to her stomach. True, if they hadn&#39;t shown up, an even 
greater slaughter would&#39;ve taken place, with the British garrison taking 
the blame. It didn&#39;t make the taking of life any easier for her. She 
then remembered the young blond clutching her from behind.

&quot;Nene-san, you okay?&quot; 

&quot;I will be once I get off this horse. You&#39;re crazy, you know that? 
Riding into battle when you&#39;ve never been trained to ride...&quot; 

Linna smiled as Nene continued to berate her the whole way back to 
headquarters.

------

&quot;Kiyoshi? Are you sure my Liege?&quot; Masazaku asked.

&quot;You don&#39;t forget the face of a scoundrel like that.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I too remember Kiyoshi.&quot; Raidon said. &quot;Funny, I never noticed the 
similarity before.&quot;

&quot;Gentleman, it&#39;s worse than just Kiyoshi. Slowly, over the past few 
days, old and familiar faces in the halls and corridors of the palace 
have given way to strangers. I can&#39;t put my finger on it, but 
something&#39;s going on. Something most serious.&quot;

&quot;Sire,&quot; Masazaku began, &quot;Shall we get the Imperial Guard to escort you 
to a place of refuge such as...&quot; he was cut off as the door to the 
chamber burst open, and the staff outside the room, including Kiyoshi, 
began slowly making their way in.

&quot;What is this impertinence?&quot; the Emperor demanded. &quot;I demand an 
explanation.&quot;

&quot;Emperor Meiji,&quot; a European said as he walked into the room and stood in 
front of the gathered mass of men before the Emperor, &quot;I&#39;m afraid I have 
to ask you to come with us. You are now our prisoner.&quot;

&quot;How... How dare you?&quot; Masazaku asked, shaking with rage. Turning to the 
men in the room, he began to verbally assault them. &quot;Traitors! Murderous 
scum! You betray the Son of Heaven, the descendent of the Divine 
Amaterasu to a gaijin! You...&quot; Masazaku stopped suddenly, before 
coughing up blood and falling to the floor, a dagger in his back. 
Emperor Meiji looked to see who had killed him, and was shocked to find 
Raidon standing there, Masazaku&#39;s blood still on his hands.

Turning back to his captors, and the gaijin in particular, he stood 
straight as he tried his best to assume the air of dignified authority 
becoming an Emperor.

&quot;As long as I am your prisoner,&quot; he began, trying to keep his voice from 
trembling as he looked back down at his once trusted advisor, &quot;Might I 
have your name, at least, so I might know what to call you?&quot;

&quot;Mason. Brian J. Mason.&quot;

&quot;Brian J. Mason? Mason, do you fully understand the ramifications of 
what you have done, or what you&#39;re about to do? Do you realize what will 
happen should word get out that my abduction was masterminded by a 
European?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Emperor.&quot; Mason said, smiling. &quot;In fact, I&#39;m counting on it.&quot;

---To Be Continued---

End Notes: Okay, so it wasn&#39;t quite as violent as I thought it was going 
to be. It will be more so as the series progresses, though. Thanks again 
to everyone who&#39;s reviewed this little story of mine. I hope you all 
stick around &#39;till the end.
