<pre>A mother&#39;s smile.
So sweet and calm.
Like the gentle slumber of a newborn infant.
I cling to her breast, 
A child wanting her mother.
She comforts me.
She always does.

I remember when we first met.
I was so ashamed and angry.
She was so spiteful and cruel.
The bond we share is that of two women
Who are both so lonely;
Yet so cold.
She is the one who will never abandon me.

When my first love died, she offered me something more.
When my second love died, she understood my pain.
When my third love saved her, I knew he was the one.
My mother, 
My sister,
And my friend.

Sylia Stingray.
