<h1>Moments in Time (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/momentime-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Hi Silvie,&quot; Sara smiled up at the female boomer, the
thirteen year old girl sitting on the floor by Mackey
and Nigel as they reassembled the motorbike. The light
brown haired girl was covered in grease but quite
happy, sitting by the troolbox ready to hand any
needed tools over.

&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; Silvie smiled back, the boomer
bowing to her slightly as well. Like many boomers she
looked human, but in this case she had silvery eyes
and hair, giving her an almost unearthly look. She was
clad in shades of blue, a simple yet comfortable
jumpsuit.

Sara cheerfully handed over a requested wrench as she
seriously said, &quot;I think Priss-poppa is hiding from
you again.&quot;

Silvie actually sighed softly, the human gesture oddly
cute from the boomer. &quot;I know,&quot; she conceded, &quot;though
I still don&#39;t understand why.&quot;

&quot;Priss-poppa has issues,&quot; Sara said wisely.

Sylia Stingray fought back laughter as she turned away
from the monitor, looking at the faintly pained look
on Priss&#39; face. &quot;I think our daughter is a bit too
precocious,&quot; Priss grumbled, her dark brown hair
falling into her eyes.

&quot;Yes, she certainly has you pegged,&quot; Sylia agreed,
eyes filled with amusement as the silver haired woman
sat by her on the sofa.

&quot;Don&#39;t you start,&quot; Priss grumbled, slouching in her
seat dressed in jeans and T-shirt.

Sylia looked at her with some sympathy as the
stylishly dressed woman said, &quot;You&#39;re still
uncomfortable around Silvie?&quot;

&quot;I think the whole idea is bizarre,&quot; Priss shook her
head grimly, &quot;where the hell did you even get the idea
for this?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a logical extension of my previous designs,&quot;
Sylia said with a shrug. She fixed Priss with a
serious look, &quot;Would you at least try?&quot;

Priss sighed, holding up her hands in surrender. &quot;All
right,&quot; she said, &quot;you know I can&#39;t resist when you
get that look on your face.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Sylia bent forward so that her breath caressed
Priss&#39; ear, &quot;and as a reward Nigel and I will take
very good care of you tonight.&quot;

&quot;Sylia!&quot; Priss blushed.

Just then the sound of a chime rang out, a familiar
tone to them all. &quot;Miss Sylia,&quot; the black haired
boomer rushed in, her appearance eerily similar to
Silvie&#39;s near perfect form except she was dressed in a
silver jumpsuit, &quot;we&#39;ve received a request for
assistance from the AD Police.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Athena,&quot; Sylia said as she and Priss got
up, &quot;has the customary sum been deposit in our
account?&quot;

Athena nodded, &quot;Already confirmed.&quot;

&quot;Linna and Nene?&quot; Sylia asked as she pulled her top
off, unclipping her dress once she shrugged her bra
off.

&quot;Nene is on scene with Minerva,&quot; Athena said as she
moved to stand intimately close to Sylia, &quot;she&#39;ll be
ready to deploy when needed. Miss Yamazaki-Chang
hasn&#39;t responded to the alert yet.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t she and Reika out of town,&quot; Priss remembered,
her eyes almost unwillingly drawn to the stripping
Sylia

&quot;I remember,&quot; Sylia slid her shoes and stockings off,
then casually stripped her underwear off, feeling
Priss admiring gaze. She held out her hand to Athena,
&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

Athena took Sylia&#39;s hand then the boomer seemed to
dissolve, it&#39;s artificial flesh and bones flowing over
the nude woman like water. It coated her in seconds in
a off gray shell then hardened, colors shifting and
changing until Sylia was dressed in a replica of her
original hardsuit.

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever get used to that,&quot; Priss
muttered as she began to strip, her own clothes
hitting the floor quickly as she waited for Silvie to
arrive.

The visor of Sylia&#39;s hardsuit drew back on her mental
command as she smiled. &quot;You&#39;ll adapt,&quot; she promised.

&quot;Don&#39;t bet on it,&quot; Priss bitched as Silvie rushed
inside and over to her side. She offered her hand to
the boomer as she flatly said, &quot;Ready.&quot;

&quot;Go,&quot; Silvie nodded as they shook hands and initiated
the conversion from normal boomer servant to hardsuit.
In only a moment Priss was garbed in a light and dark
blue armor, resembling her original suit with some
variations.

Reaching up Priss tapped her visor, withdrawing it to
reveal her catlike eyes. &quot;Are we using the launcher?&quot;
she asked Sylia as she followed her through the halls.

&quot;We&#39;ll have to, the mobile pit isn&#39;t going to get us
there in time,&quot; Sylia said, stopping by a control
panel and accessing news reports along with police
band data. &quot;Two of the older generation boomers are
rampaging,&quot; she sounded annoyed, &quot;the AD Police are
containing as planned.&quot;

Stepping into the magnetic rail gun that could launch
them anywhere in the city Priss noted, &quot;I still find
it hard to believe that you&#39;ve got a formal agreement
with the AD Police.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Sylia looked amused as she took her own
position. &quot;The AD Police knows we&#39;re the most cost
effective way to deal with boomers.&quot;

&quot;I doubt Leon agrees,&quot; Priss chuckled right before the
launcher fired, sending them soaring across the city.

&quot;Where the hell are those Knight Sabers?&quot; Leon McNicol
growled, the tall brown haired man hammering his fist
on the roof of the patrol car. Under his breath he
grumbled, &quot;I need a coffee.&quot;

Daley smiled up at him impishly, &quot;Now, now, I&#39;m sure
they&#39;re on their way.&quot; Something whizzed by and both
men ducked reflexedly.

The boomer made a incoherent howl, it&#39;s deformed head
looking around wildly as the mutated creature dragged
itself along the ground, leaving the wreckage of the
burning building to look around on the sidewalk.

Nene Romanova hurried over, the little blonde followed
by a sleek, pink clad boomer. &quot;Is the other one still
in the building?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;As far as I know,&quot; Leon grumped. Both stayed crouched
by the cruiser, seeing the boomer tearing at the
sidewalk for more rubble to throw.

&quot;Thank you Leon-poo,&quot; Nene teased, her impish manner
oddly out of place with her sergeant insignia. A bit
more seriously she said, &quot;Excuse me.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t call me that,&quot; Leon barked as Nene hurried off.

&quot;Why do you call him that?&quot; the boomer asked curiously
as she hurried by Nene&#39;s side.

&quot;Because it&#39;s fun, Minerva,&quot; Nene answered impishly.
They ducked into an out of the way alley and Nene
quickly stripped her uniform off before she clasped
Minerva&#39;s hand and ordered, &quot;Initiate transformation.&quot;

&quot;Transformation begins,&quot; Minerva flowed apart
gracefully, swirling around Nene to reform into a suit
of familiar looking armor.

As the armored Nene hurried out of the alley she heard
the distinctive sound of the Knight Sabers landing on
a nearby roof and used her boot thrusters to carry
herself up to their side. &quot;What took you?&quot; Nene
teased.

Sylia turned, her wicked smile evident even through
the armor as she purred, &quot;Sorry, Priss and I were a
bit busy when you called.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Nene squeaked, feeling her cheeks redden.

&quot;She&#39;s exaggerating,&quot; Priss said dryly, her body
nearly humming with anticipation beneath her hardsuit.
&quot;It&#39;s on a standard rampage? No unexpected variation?&quot;
she asked crisply, her voice entirely professional.

Nene nodded, &quot;Two boomers, one in the structure, one
on the street, both are following the usual
progression in transformation.&quot;

&quot;And the AD Police is still maintaining perimeter
guard?&quot; Sylia asked her, confirming the earlier
report.

&quot;The Boomers stay in, civilians stay out,&quot; Nene
nodded.

&quot;Then let&#39;s go take out some boomers,&quot; Priss grinned
as she lead the charge off the roof.

To be continued!

Chapter Notes: The original idea for a android/human
armor merger comes from Figure 17, but I should also
offer a tip of the hat to Dan Wisner, who co-wrote a
fic on the topic with me over in our Tennokiken
crossover.</pre>
