<h1>Stage 3 (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This can be considered a reboot, much like 2040 was a reboot of the 
first series.


Sylia Stingray sat in the back of the black limo, her short black hair 
falling around her face as the young woman watched traffic race on by on 
the streets of Tokyo. Thoughtfully she counted all the cars that had 
been made by Genom owned companies but stopped after a minute and 
already reaching a hundred. Instead she turned her brown eyes to the 
paperwork on her padd, a ultra slim computer evolved from the primitive 
Blackberry.

Today was the day... after reaching legal adulthood Sylia was finally 
gaining ownership of her father&#39;s company, Genom International. Over 
forty years ago Dr. Katsuhito Stingray had created the company&#39;s 
greatest product, the artificial humanoid called Boomer, as well as 
guided it into becoming one of the most powerful companies in the globe. 
Why, Genom&#39;s Tokyo tower itself employed nearly half the sprawling 
metropolis, and it was only one of dozens of such facilities all around 
the world.

The limo pulled up to the base of the tower and onto the main access 
ramp, stopping in front of the gate. A male-type guard boomer scanned 
their paperwork and the gate opened, the security force field snapping 
back on once they drove through. The car followed the curving road past 
the lower industrial levels of the facility and stopped about half way 
up, where the administrative levels began.

&quot;Here you go, Miss Stingray,&quot; the male boomer driver in the impeccable 
black suit said as he opened up her door.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sylia said to it with reflexive politeness, standing in the 
cool shade provided by the tower as she watched the regional manager 
hurry out along with the soon to be retiring vice president. &#39;The gate 
guard must have been programmed to phone ahead when I arrived,&#39; she 
thought, amused.

Brian J. Mason pushed back his black hair as he smiled at her 
charmingly, the taller man looking just a little nervous. &quot;Miss 
Stingray, we weren&#39;t expecting you to arrive so soon,&quot; the manager said, 
&quot;you just got back from overseas.&quot;

&#39;From my years in a foreign boarding school,&#39; Sylia smiled back calmly, 
but inside she felt a flash of annoyance. &quot;I thought it would be good 
for company confidence if I showed due diligence,&quot; she answered calmly.

&quot;Of course, of course,&quot; Quincy Rosencroitz said quickly, the old man 
standing straight with the assistance of metallic braces added to his 
legs. His voice was strong for a man in his eighties, too, not reedy 
like some might be as he said, &quot;It&#39;s good to have you here, Sylia.&quot;

&#39;Is this what my father&#39;s voice might sound like now?&#39; Sylia wondered 
sadly, knowing he had been in his fifties when he fathered her, having 
died only six years after. &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; she answered him 
respectfully as she continued, &quot;and thank you for all your efforts 
watching over the company for me.&quot;

Quincy smiled back a little sadly as he explained simply, &quot;Why, it was 
the least I could do for your father.&quot;

Brian looked between the two of them then smiled nervously as he asked, 
&quot;Maybe we should go inside?&quot;

Sylia saw the tiredness that Quincy tried to hide and nodded politely as 
she answered, &quot;Of course, let&#39;s go in.&quot;

Inside the main entrance hall the whole upper staff of the primary tower 
had been assembled, mostly made up of the heads of each division within 
Genom. Along with Mason there were reps for Boomers, Autos, Music and 
entertainment, computers and other products Genom created. Along with 
them was the head of Genom&#39;s security force the AD Police, Jeena Malso, 
who met her gaze with cool intensity.

Unlike most machines Boomers had a very low failure rate, only one in a 
hundred, and most of those failures were minor. But with the booming 
business in them the failures did crop up, and Occasionally proved 
dangerous. Serving their primary purpose the AD Police were called in, 
capturing or destroying the Boomer as needed.

&quot;Commander Malso,&quot; Sylia shook her hand, &quot;you do good work.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jeena shook it, the older woman smiling tightly.

As expected for the arrival of a new president Sylia gave a short 
speech, a mix of &#39;thank you for all your hard work,&#39; and &#39;let&#39;s do our 
best together&#39; along with a bit of &#39;the future shines brightly on the 
company as a new era begins.&#39; It was all cliche but Sylia knew the way 
the game was played and played it very well.

&quot;Nicely done, Miss Stingray,&quot; Mason murmured as he lead her into the 
elevator and off on a tour of the facilities.

&quot;I did some reading on this kind of thing,&quot; Sylia admitted as they 
stopped on the music and entertainment floor. Headed up by Reika Chang 
they handled everything from themes for Genom&#39;s commercials to managing 
a music label that Genom owned.

The secretary in front of Reika&#39;s office was a attractive brown haired 
woman with a athletic look about her, despite the sleek suit she wore. 
&quot;Miss Stingray, Mr Mason,&quot; she smiled, her green suit hugging her form 
as she rose respectfully, &quot;should I check if Ms Chang is available to 
see you?&quot;

&quot;No need, Miss Yamazaki,&quot; Mason nodded. Turning to Sylia he said, &quot;Linna 
Yamazaki is one of our top executive assistants... in fact I&#39;ve tried to 
steal her for myself many times but she&#39;s distressingly loyal.&quot;

Linna blushed as she pushed her short hair back, &quot;You exaggerate, Mr 
Mason.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you, Linna,&quot; Sylia nodded, almost unwillingly noting how 
attractive the slim woman really was. &#39;This is not the place or time,&#39; 
Sylia reminded herself firmly, &#39;she works for you.&#39;

The tour took most of the day and Sylia felt rather annoyed that she 
couldn&#39;t get right down to work. Still, it was only her first day, and 
there was plenty of time to begin on the changes she ultimately planned.

The next few days were spent learning the lay of the land, primarily 
studying the computer system. Of course before now Sylia had access to 
the Genom mainframes from home, but only as a standard user. With her 
ascending to the presidency she gained unfettered access to the global 
system and the ability to go anywhere.

&quot;Isn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Sylia muttered as her hands flew over the 
keyboard generated in the smooth surface of her desk. The office on the 
top floor of the tower was beautifully decorated and offered a terrific 
view of the city, but Sylia&#39;s attention was focused on the holographic 
screen. Again and again the messages popped up: insufficient access, 
fatal error and more.

&#39;This doesn&#39;t make sense,&#39; Sylia mused as she sat back, &#39;I have root 
access. There&#39;s no way I can&#39;t get into this memory block.&#39;

Archives for Genom were saved every year, dating back to the year that 
Genom had been founded. But mysteriously the memory stored during the 
year Sulia&#39;s father had died was inaccessible... according to the 
computer, there was literally nothing there.

Going through the system directory Sylia checked with maintenance first, 
making sure the hard drives were all still intact. The data had been 
extracted in the past and transferred to modern storage, but those high 
density drives checked out fine. Once she confirmed that she moved on to 
step two, contacting the head of computer services and asking what the 
status of the box was.

Lisa Valante was a young woman, very nearly as young as Sylia, but that 
wasn&#39;t an impediment in the world of computers. Young people were nearly 
raised with data access, and the more talented kids were quickly 
recognized and shunted into the correct programs. Lisa was sharper than 
most prodigies, having skipped over much of high school and university 
to pursue a self constructed program of computer research.

The dusky skinned blonde smiled wryly as Lisa addressed Sylia, &quot;There&#39;s 
nothing wrong with that unit.&quot;

&quot;Easy for you to say,&quot; Sylia answered dryly, &quot;so why can&#39;t I get into 
that unit?&quot;

&quot;It was sealed by a authority higher than yours, I&#39;d guess,&quot; Lisa 
answered.

Sylia frowned as she sat up, &quot;But there is no authority higher than mine 
in Genom!&quot;

&quot;There is one, in theory,&quot; Lisa answered, meeting Sylia&#39;s irritated gaze 
coolly, &quot;your father. If he ordered it sealed before he died...&quot;

Sylia visibly made herself relax, sitting back in her chair. &quot;Is there 
any way to confirm that?&quot; she asked as she watched the image on the 
screen.

Lisa gave Sylia a apologetic look as she answered, &quot;I&#39;ll do what I can, 
but you might need a better hacker than I am.&quot;

&quot;Do you have anyone on staff?&quot; Sylia asked while also considering her 
various school mates and friends.

&quot;Actually, there&#39;s someone I know...,&quot; Lisa conceded.

Nene Romanova was not whom Sylia had been expecting. She was small, 
redheaded, and oddly irreverent as she looked around Sylia&#39;s office, 
always wearing her white gloves. She was a loaner from the AD Police, a 
officer in their cyber-crime department. Part of her job involved 
reconstructing data hacks, developing quite a talent herself.

&quot;You understand I require confidentiality on this?&quot; Sylia stressed. 
&quot;While it&#39;s not forbidden for the president of Genom to pursue this sort 
of puzzle, a adversary could use it to imply I&#39;m unstable or unsuitable 
to lead.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Nene sniffed. She hesitated as she began to pull off her 
gloves, &quot;Besides, I can understand keeping secrets.&quot;

Sylia didn&#39;t gasp because she was used to seeing prosthetics on her 
classmates, especially the self-styled cyberpunks, but she felt a twinge 
of surprise at the clearly visible artificial hands. &quot;Those are Boomer 
tech,&quot; she noted, &quot;why not get the skin color changed to match yours?&quot;

Nene set herself up using a portable terminal as she answered, &quot;I had 
some grey-market interface tech installed. Using a added layer of false 
skin might interfere with the system access filaments.&quot; With that she 
sat by her terminal, tiny almost invisible strings of material extending 
from her fingertips to plug directly to the terminal, data streaming by 
on the holographic screen without her pressing a single key.

&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Sylia murmured as she tried to track Nene&#39;s process on 
her own computer, &quot;maybe I should get that done.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t,&quot; Nene said, eyes closed as she concentrated, &quot;you can get 
fired for having this kind of enhancement.&quot; She frowned, &quot;I started out 
in the regular Police before they fired me over my hands.&quot;

&quot;Their loss was our gain,&quot; Sylia noted.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Nene said as the data streaming by slowed slightly. &quot;Here we 
go... whoever put this lock in was a paranoid, it&#39;s asking me for 
multiple word and number codes. I&#39;m processing now... oh damn!&quot;

Sylia sat up, &quot;What!&quot;

&quot;I triggered a flag of some kind,&quot; Nene scowled, &quot;I don&#39;t know what...&quot;

With a loud crash they heard something break out in the hallway, then 
continue towards the suite. Sylia got up from behind her desk as she 
ordered, &quot;Disengage, now.&quot;

Strands of material smoothly retracted into her hands as Nene asked, &quot;Do 
you think the flag I tripped...?&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Sylia answered as something tore into the door.
