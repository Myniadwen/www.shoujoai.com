<h1>Senshi Sabers (part 10 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/sensabers-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>      &quot;I still think this is a really bad idea,&quot; Makoto Kino said,
the brown haired woman sitting beside Ami in the sports car. Ahead
of them Infinity Tower rose far above the sprawling city, a gleaming
structure of glass and metal.

      Ami shrugged slightly, keeping her eyes firmly on the road.
Only yesterday she had been invited by Hotaru Tomoe to visit here,
sparking a lively debate among the Senshi Sabers. In all honestly
she had been pleasantly surprised at the concern the women showed
towards her.

      &#39;Especially Rei,&#39; Ami had to admit. She looked over at
Makoto and smiled slightly, &quot;It&#39;s not like I could really refuse the
invitation, you know.&quot;

      &quot;I know,&quot; Makoto conceded. She smiled grimly, &quot;That&#39;s why we
decided that I&#39;d come along as a kind of bodyguard.&quot;

      &quot;You mean you three decided,&quot; Ami corrected with
amusement, &quot;I don&#39;t seem to recall being given much choice in the
matter.&quot;

      &quot;You think we&#39;re going to let you go into the lion&#39;s den
itself all alone?&quot; Makoto questioned. The car began to follow the
curving ramp that went up the outside of the tower as she
continued, &quot;We can&#39;t afford to loose you, Ami.&quot;

      &quot;The Senshi Sabers could continue,&quot; Ami said, glad that the
car&#39;s scramblers were working, &quot;the data is backed up in Mercury and
with a third party.&quot;

      &quot;I mean,&quot; Makoto gave her a scolding look as they coasted to
a stop on a parking level near the top of the tower, &quot;Minako and I
would miss you as a friend.&quot;

      They got out of the car, pausing a moment before walking
towards the entrance. &quot;And Rei?&quot; Ami found herself asking.

      &quot;She&#39;d miss you for the annoyance value,&quot; Makoto said
impishly.

      Ami just had to chuckle at that comment.

      Waiting for them there by the entrance was a red headed
woman, dressed in a stiff business suit. Kaori Knight had a coolly
professional smile and a searching gaze as she offered her hand and
said, &quot;Miss Mizuno, it&#39;s good to see you.&quot;

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; Ami shook the woman&#39;s hand, noting that she had
seen an announcement in the papers that this woman had just been
promoted to executive director. &#39;So what is such a high ranking
company officer doing greeting me?&#39;

      &quot;And you are?&quot; Kaori looked to Makoto a bit more coldly.

      &quot;Makoto Kino,&quot; she sounded more amused than anything else by
Kaori&#39;s tone, standing much taller than her, &quot;I&#39;m an friend of Miss
Mizuno&#39;s.&quot;

      &quot;She was a bit worried, but I like having a friend,&quot; Ami put
a subtle emphasis on the last word, &quot;around who&#39;s so concerned about
me.&quot;

      Kaori blushed faintly, misinterpreting the relationship
exactly as Ami intended. &quot;Of course,&quot; she lead them inside as she
continued, &quot;I&#39;ll take you to where Miss Tomoe is waiting.&quot;

      &quot;So what&#39;s Tomoe like?&quot; Makoto asked as they walked down the
hall.

      &quot;She shared a great deal in common with her father, the
former Chairman,&quot; Kaori answered firmly, &quot;I&#39;m sure she will lead
Infinity well.&quot;

      &#39;A very diplomatic answer,&#39; Ami noted mentally.

      The halls of the tower around them were oddly comfortable,
decorated with fine art and paintings, but still it was all cold
steel and glass. The plush carpet barely made a sound as they
walked, a faint scent of oil and machinery in the air beneath the
perfume.

      They reached a set of doors and Kaori raised her hand to
knock when a voice came over the speakers. &quot;Welcome Miss Mizuno,
Miss Kino,&quot; the woman said, &quot;come in.&quot;

      The doors opened automatically, revealing a modestly sized
office. To one side a couch, table and chair were waiting, while on
the other a desk was set nearby the window, a young woman sitting
there. Hotaru Tomoe got up and went around the desk to greet them,
her shoulder length black hair being gently blow by the breeze. The
black dress the slim woman wore was business wear but still looked
good on her, even with her pale color.

      &quot;Miss Mizuno, I&#39;ve been looking forward to meeting you,&quot;
Hotaru took Ami&#39;s hand and shook it gently, her smile warm.

      Ami smiled back coolly, &quot;Charmed.&quot;

      &quot;Miss Kino,&quot; Hotaru turned, &quot;I understand that the Megatokyo
martial arts community lost a great competitor when you retired.&quot;

      Makoto didn&#39;t let much of her surprise show at being
recognized as she commented, &quot;I still run my school, so it&#39;s not so
much of a problem.&quot;

      &quot;It still annoys me to see our Bio-Boomers being misused in
that way,&quot; Hotaru said to her conversationally, &quot;and I hope to find
out who did it so that they can be punished.&quot;

      After a moment Kaori smiled slightly and asked, &quot;Miss Tomoe,
would you like me to remain here for the discussions?&quot;

      &quot;Please,&quot; Hotaru gave Kaori a smile, &quot;at least some of what
we&#39;ll be talking about will involve your duties, too.&quot; She gestured
the women over to the couch and chairs, &quot;Please take a seat, I&#39;ve
ordered tea to be sent up to us.&quot;

      Ami and Makoto sat down together on the couch, Hotaru and
Kaori taking the individual seats. Almost on cue a Bio-boomer
arrived with the pot of tea, the young woman pouring them cups,
setting out snacks and then leaving silently.

      &quot;I suppose you&#39;re wondering why I asked you here,&quot; Hotaru
said, taking a delicate bite of her cookie then washing it down with
tea.

      &quot;I was,&quot; Ami cautiously agreed, &quot;my family hasn&#39;t been
associated with Infinity since my mother stopped working here.&quot;

      Hotaru put her cup down on the table as she quietly
said, &quot;After my father&#39;s death I came into possession of his private
files, information that has never come into the public eye.&quot;

      Ami drank some tea, feeling a flash of excitement. &quot;And?&quot;
she asked calmly.

      &quot;Your mother was killed I an car accident shortly after she
began to take steps to protect her rights over the Bio-boomer
designs,&quot; Hotaru sighed softly, &quot;information in my father&#39;s files
indicate that she was murdered.&quot;

      &quot;Miss Tomoe, I still think that discussing this is a bad
idea,&quot; Kaori cautioned her employer.

      Hotaru tossed Kaori a gentle smile, &quot;We have to stop the rot
somewhere, Kaori. I choose to do it here and now.&quot;

      &quot;What do you intend to do with this information?&quot; Makoto
asked intently, a bit surprised by Ami&#39;s shocked silence.

      &quot;Release it to the press,&quot; Hotaru said promptly, &quot;along with
the AD Police, in hopes that they can re-open the case.&quot;

      Kaori was looking with concern at the still silent Ami. &quot;Are
you all right, Miss Mizuno?&quot; she asked her quietly.

      &quot;Sorry,&quot; Ami shook herself a little. Playing the relative
innocent she said, &quot;I always wondered if something unsavory had
happened, but I was never sure.&quot;

      &quot;Of course,&quot; Hotaru answered. &quot;I know that this is a lot to
take in,&quot; she said softly, &quot;so I intend to give you time to digest
it, but I do have a proposition for you.&quot;

      &quot;Yes?&quot; Ami did her best not to sound too wary.

      &quot;Looking through some of your mother&#39;s files I got the sense
that she had a vision for Bio-boomers and their peaceful association
with humanity,&quot; Hotaru said gravely, &quot;one I&#39;d like to bring about
with your help.  I&#39;d like to offer you a position with the company,
rank and title to be determined, to help us accomplish that dream.&quot;

      Ami drank a bit of tea, setting it down with a soft
clink. &quot;I&#39;ll need time to consider it,&quot; she said, &quot;but I thank you
for the offer.&quot;

      A Bio-boomer arrived as Hotaru smiled. &quot;Take as much time as
you need,&quot; she said as she handed Ami a car with her private phone
lines on it, &quot;though I hope you accept.&quot; She gestured to the Bio-
boomer, &quot;This one will escort you to your car.&quot;

      Kaori waited a few moments before softly saying, &quot;She wasn&#39;t
quite what I was expecting.&quot;

      Hotaru smiled slightly as she gazed out the window, watching
the car driving away. &quot;She was exactly as I expected,&quot; she
answered, &quot;Ami Mizuno is clearly the woman behind the Senshi Sabers.&quot;

      &quot;So what do we do about it now?&quot; Kaori asked.

      &quot;Do our best to bring her and her associates in,&quot; Hotaru
answered, &quot;we&#39;ll need all of their help when Mistress Nine finally
awakens.&quot;</pre>
