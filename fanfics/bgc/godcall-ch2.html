<h1>A Goddess Comes to Call (part 2 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/godcall-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Beneath Genom&#39;s Tokyo branch, several levels underground. Down a 
darkened hallway to a closed door, then through it. Several people sit 
on a elevated level, and stare down at a young man standing there 
before them.

&#39;A bit over the top,&#39; he thought, trying to hide a smile, &#39;but I 
suppose it&#39;s effective.&#39; He stood under their gaze, and tried his best 
not to fidget. It wasn&#39;t easy.

He struggled silently with his nervousness as he waited to hear their 
verdict on his project. Finally, after consulting the piles of 
paperwork and a softly whispered consultation, the head of the 
committee decided to speak.

&quot;I simply fail to see any grounds for forming this division, Mr. 
Jacobson,&quot; she said to him with a fierce frown of displeasure. She 
waved the folder around, saying scornfully, &quot;A Paranormal Research 
Department?&quot;

Another board member shook his head mournfully, adding &quot;I just don&#39;t 
see how chasing ghosts and youma will be of any help to achieving 
Genom&#39;s objectives.&quot;

&quot;We wont just be chasing ghosts,&quot; Jacobson answered him, keeping his 
voice as calm as he could, &quot;instead we&#39;ll be investigating things like 
this.&quot; He took out a small remote control and then activated a view 
screen on the far wall.

There was a bit of static at first, then the recording came on. On the 
screen, a section of Tokyo itself lay in ruins, fires burning through 
several of the buildings. Two figures stand there, looking at each 
other. Both young men are dark haired, and look almost eerily alike. 
Oddly, both of them are carrying longswords, and are dressed in boy&#39;s 
school uniforms.

One of the two turns towards the camera, his eyes narrow slightly as 
he sees the person filming them, and he makes a short, throwing 
gesture towards them. The visual record then abruptly comes to an end.

Jacobson used his remote to shut the video recording off. He turns, 
meeting the eyes of each of the members of the committee. In each of 
them he saw the horror of what they had seen, even as he let the 
silence linger for a few moments longer.

&quot;The Kamui incident is a well documented event involving multiple 
beings of great psionic power, who did massive damage across the city 
of Tokyo,&quot; he said calmly. He looked up at the circle of faces, &quot;Now 
imagine what Genom could do if we could find a being of such power.&quot;

Some of the committee members looked rather thoughtful at that, but 
the head still looked rather dubious. &quot;Where would you find such 
beings?&quot; she asked with a frown.

&quot;There are a number of existing leads we&#39;ll be actively 
investigating,&quot; he explained, &quot;the stories of the Sailor Senshi, the 
boy who was as strong as a wild horse, Boogiepop, the Phantom Quest 
Corporation, and that&#39;s just to name a few.&quot;

&quot;But if those particular leads don&#39;t pan out? What if you can&#39;t find 
any of these beings of power?&quot; another member challenged him.

Jacobson smiled back at them calmly, glad that he&#39;d been prepared for 
that question. &quot;We have also contacted with an expert in the field,&quot; 
he explained, &quot;and I&#39;m quite confident that she will be of great use 
to our search.&quot;

She walked from the shadows, long tawny hair flowing down her back. 
She dressed oddly, but even more strange was the odd looking &#39;v&#39; mark 
on her forehead. There was a soft intake of breath from most of the 
committee, as they felt her power.

&quot;I hope I can help,&quot; Mara said to them all with a dangerous little 
smile on her face, taking a moment to throw her hair back over her 
shoulder.

The vote was nearly assured at that point. A few more questions, and 
his budget was approved for the next few months. The head of the 
committee came over to him, smiling in a friendly sort of way. But the 
anger in her eyes wasn&#39;t so easily hidden.

&quot;I wish you the best of luck,&quot; she said, shaking his hand. A cool 
smile, &quot;We&#39;ll be watching your progress eagerly.&quot;

&#39;In other words,&#39; Jacobson thought wryly, &quot;screw up and we&#39;ll know 
about it.&#39; He smiled at her naturally, &quot;Thank you very much.&quot;



The meeting was adjourned, and Mara walked him down the hall towards 
his newly set up office space. &quot;I have a tip for you,&quot; Mara said 
calmly, &quot;to start you off,&quot; and gave him the co-ordinate data for a 
location in downtown Tokyo.

&quot;What should I expect?&quot; Jacobson asked her, just a bit nervous.

Mara smiled to herself, thinking of who was likely to be there very 
soon. &quot;Fireworks,&quot; she said to him dryly, &quot;expect to see lots of 
fireworks.&quot; She looked at him sideways, before adding quite firmly, 
&quot;Just do the data collection, to start off with. I wouldn&#39;t recommend 
you interfere with any of them, at least not just yet.&quot;

He nodded slightly, and took off to prepare his field team.

Author&#39;s Note: The &#39;Kaumi&#39; incident refers to Clamp&#39;s X manga and 
anime. The other series he mentions are Sailor Moon, Ranma 1/2, 
Boogiepop Phantom, and Phantom Quest Corp.
