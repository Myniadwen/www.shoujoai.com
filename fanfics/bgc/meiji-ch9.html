<h1>Bubblegum Crisis: Meiji (part 9 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/meiji-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Madam Shizue stood outside the entrance of the brothel she ran, a fan in 
her hand covering her face. Located in the red light district of Tokyo 
where prostitution was still legal, she had fifteen women in the 
establishment, not counting her... boarder, of course. The thought of 
that one who paid rent for the room at the end of the hall gave her 
chills. She could still remember the agreement; she needed a place to 
stay where others wouldn&#39;t think to find her, and she offered in return 
to pay rent and take care of any customers who got out of hand.

After what she did to the second rowdy customer however, Madam Shizue 
told her to just pay the rent and leave it at that.

Looking down the street to her left, she saw the Johns and the joro 
(prostitutes) walking up and down the street. She turned to her right, 
and saw a man in black standing not less than three feet away from her.

&quot;Ayii! O... O-niwaban!&quot; she cried out as she quickly fell to her knees 
and placed her forehead on the ground in fear for her life.

&quot;Get up, woman. The Iga Clan has no vendetta with you, or anyone else in 
this house.&quot;

The woman slowly got up, tears of joy in her eyes, &quot;Thank you, oh thank 
you o-niwaban.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m here for a woman.&quot;

Pulling herself together, she smiled as she wiped her tears away. &quot;A 
woman? Why, why yes, of course. Please, come in. You shall have two 
women, ninja, two of my best for the price of one! Anri, Sylvie...&quot;

&quot;No, you don&#39;t understand.&quot; he said. Shizue held her hand up and 
signaled the two to return to where they came from. &quot;I&#39;m not looking for 
a joro. I&#39;m... I&#39;m here for, for the betsushikime (woman warrior).&quot;

Madam Shizue&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;The... the betsushikime? Oh... But...&quot;

&quot;Where is she, woman?&quot;

Terror gripped her heart. The woman had warned her under no 
circumstances to ever disturb her. She left her money outside the 
madam&#39;s room in a bag, always unseen, and ordered her food be left 
outside her door. It had been months since she or any of the joro had 
laid eyes on her.

&quot;O-niwaban, I...&quot;

&quot;Now!&quot; he shouted, grabbing her roughly by the wrist. &quot;Show me to her 
room now, or I&#39;ll show you the edge of my do (traditional sword of a 
ninja)!&quot;

&quot;Alright, I... I&#39;ll show you. This way.&quot; she said, as she grabbed a 
candle and led him down the darkened hallway. As they got closer, the 
apprentice could almost swear the hallway felt like it was getting 
colder. Reaching the end of the hallway, the madam fearfully raised her 
hand and knocked at the door.

&quot;Hai.&quot; a voice cold as death said from inside the room.

Forgive me, but... but you have a visitor.&quot;

A moment of silence followed, then, &quot;Man or woman?&quot;

&quot;M... Man.&quot;

&quot;Show him in.&quot;

Madam Shizue turned the knob, opened the door a crack for the ninja, and 
then ran as fast as she was able back down the hall. The apprentice 
swallowed hard, and went in.

The room was dark, lit by a hole in the ceiling and two candles on 
stands behind the nude woman sitting cross-legged in the floor. In front 
of her was a burning stick of incense. As the ninja apprentice&#39;s eyes 
adjusted to the light, he saw that the woman&#39;s arms were cut up and 
bleeding slightly as she seemed to scratch continually at them with her 
sharp nails. Her dark, wild and unkempt hair covered her face and 
breasts, and reached down to her rear in the back. Her skin was an 
almost chalk-white color. Everything about the betsushikime&#39;s appearance 
was unnerving. She was looking down, rocking a bit back and forth as she 
continued scratching at her arms.

As the ninja closed the door behind him, she looked up and swept the 
hair back away from her face with one hand. Her face was white as the 
rest of her, except for the black eyeshadow and black lipstick she was 
wearing. She tilted her head as she noted the distinctive clothing of 
the ninja. As she got up and began to walk forward, the ninja quickly 
pulled out the scroll with trembling hands, falling to his knees as he 
lowered his head and held the parchment out to her. A shudder went 
through him as he felt her icy hands take the scroll from him. After 
reading what it said, she knelt down in front of him, sitting back on 
her heels.

&quot;Relax, o-niwaban of the Iga Clan.&quot; she said in a barely audible voice 
which was devoid of all emotion, &quot;You shall not die today.&quot;

The young apprentice breathed a sigh of relief.

&quot;It must be bad if the Iga Clan is seeking my help. Who do they need 
assassinated?&quot; she asked.

&quot;The Knight Sabers.&quot;

&quot;I see. Do we know any of the names of their members?&quot;

&quot;Just one; Sylia Stingray.&quot;

&quot;Sylia? Hmm... Now there&#39;s a name I haven&#39;t heard in a long time. Not 
since her and I trained at the dojo together.&quot;

The ninja&#39;s heart fell at that news. Just as the members of the Iga Clan 
looked upon themselves as brothers, any and all members of a dojo, 
trained in a ryu (school or fighting style) looked upon each other as 
family. 

&quot;Does... does this mean you will no longer take up your sword, now that 
you know one of them is a sister from the dojo?&quot;

The betsushikime smiled at him.

&quot;She was a sister once, but no longer. Tell your sempai I accept.&quot;

---Two nights later---

Sylia tended the fire as Nene came back with more firewood. The wagon 
was resting next to a spruce tree, the three tents set up underneath the 
forest canopy. Nene held the stack of wood with one arm as she carried 
her naginata in her other hand. The sounds of a forest at night were 
unnerving her.

&quot;Sylia, do you want first watch tonight or you want me to take it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take it, Nene. You volunteered last night.&quot;

Nene nodded, then looked anxiously over her shoulder as an owl hooted. 
&quot;Do you think they&#39;re still after us?&quot;

&quot;What a silly question. Of course they&#39;re still after us. They&#39;re an 
o-niwaban Iga Clan hunting party. They will come after us until they&#39;re 
all dead.&quot;

&quot;But... But why don&#39;t they just attack? They must have caught up to us 
by now.&quot;

&quot;Because after the attack at the bar, they know we could take whatever&#39;s 
left of their party in a fight. Try to understand; a ninja is ninety 
percent reputation. They rely on fear and surprise. Most of their 
attacks come from the side or from behind. Coming straight at an 
opponent face to face who isn&#39;t scared of the o-niwaban usually evens up 
the odds. They must be either planning to try to separate us and take us 
out one by one, or...&quot;

&quot;Or?&quot;

&quot;Or they&#39;re planning on getting some sort of help, perhaps a ronin or 
group of ronin, better trained for straight-on fighting.&quot;

Just then, some giggling came out of the tent nearest the wagon, 
followed by a deep moan.

&quot;Humph, they don&#39;t seem too worried. How am I supposed to get any sleep 
tonight with that racket going on in the next tent over?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Sylia said smiling, &quot;You could always go over and tell them to 
quiet down.&quot;

The image of what Priss would do to her should she be stupid enough to 
interrupt her lovemaking suddenly presented itself in her mind, causing 
Nene to shudder.

&quot;Ummm... That&#39;s okay. They&#39;re not being too loud, I guess.&quot;

Sylia chuckled a bit at that, as Nene crept into her tent. They were 
already in Kyoto, and at the rate they were traveling, she estimated 
they&#39;d reach the temple sometime tomorrow. She was still working out in 
her head what they&#39;d do when they arrived, when another sound coming 
from the tent Linna and Priss were sharing interrupted her. &#39;Hmm, I see 
what Nene means&#39; she mused. &#39;Still, at least it will help me to stay 
awake until my shift is over.&#39;

---Meanwhile---

Taking off from Tokyo, and following the shoreline, the Dutch fishing 
vessel was making its way to the docks of Tsu, from there by river to 
Lake Biwa, and the markets of Kyoto. Captain Drewes was getting antsy to 
be done with this trip. There was something going on, something bad. 
Four of his crew, including his first mate, were missing from the boat 
and presumed dead. He didn&#39;t know what was going on, but he didn&#39;t like 
it.

Unseen by him, two of his men snuck into the hold beneath the ship&#39;s 
poop deck.

&quot;Do you have it, Sven?&quot; one of the sailors asked.

&quot;Of course, Egan.&quot; Sven said, as he pulled the whisky bottle out of his 
heavy jacket. Egan produced a tin cup, and they both commenced to 
drinking. As they were laughing at nothing in particular, a wave caused 
the ship to tip just enough to move the lantern on the crate they set it 
on. In its light, they now saw a hand emerging from the shadows. Sven 
picked up the lantern and walked over, to see the body of the first 
mate, his body cut in half at the torso.

&quot;Oh... Oh my... My God.&quot; Sven managed to get out before throwing up.

&quot;Sven, what is it? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Egan, we have to get out of here now!&quot;

Snnkt.

&quot;Hurrkkk....&quot;

&quot;Egan? Egan, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

A woman dressed in a tight, low cut black corset that showed off her 
bosom came out into view, her white skin, black lipstick and eyeshadow 
making her look like a ghost. Her hair was tied back in a tight bun, and 
in her hand she clenched a katana sword, blood dripping from the blade. 
She smiled as she saw the fear and horror in Sven&#39;s face.

&quot;Wh... Who are you?&quot; he asked, reaching into his pocket for a knife. The 
young woman&#39;s smile broadened.

&quot;Call me Galatia.&quot; she hissed, before charging him. A few seconds later 
she pulled the lantern out of Sven&#39;s hand, tossed the hand over to the 
lifeless body it came from, and blew the light out.

---The Next Morning---

Linna woke early, and looked at Priss&#39; sleeping form. She looked so 
peaceful, so serene. It was hard to imagine it was the same warrior 
she&#39;d seen in battle a few days ago. As silently as possible, she 
slipped out of her lover&#39;s arms and put her kimono on. She then quietly 
made her way to the small river Priss and her found yesterday. She 
disrobed under the cover of an ash tree, and slipped in the cold water 
for a morning washing. As she was coming up out of the water, she 
suddenly heard footsteps coming up the path not thirty-five feet away on 
the opposite side of the stream, and a voice saying something. She 
quickly scrambled out of the water and behind the ash, keeping her eyes 
on the opposite shore as she quickly dressed. 

&quot;Namu amida butsu (Buddhist chant, asking for mercy in the afterlife).&quot; 
An elderly Buddhist nun chanted as she walked to the water&#39;s edge 
carrying a basket of laundry. She began cleaning the clothes when she 
saw Linna tentatively walking out from behind the ash.

&quot;Ohayo, child.&quot; the nun said, her recently shaved head shining a bit as 
the early morning sun shone down on her. &quot;Buddha bless you.&quot;

Linna joined her hands together and bowed as she returned the blessing. 
Rising once again, she smiled as she met the nun&#39;s kindly, gentle eyes.

&quot;Nun-sama, do you have a moment to speak?&quot;

&quot;Hai, child. There&#39;s a small foot bridge over a bit to your right.&quot;

Five minutes later, Linna was bowing before the nun once again.

&quot;Please child, that&#39;s enough. Now what did you want?&quot;

&quot;Please, me and my friends, we seek the Nishi Honganji Temple. Have you 
heard of it?&quot;

The nun&#39;s countenance darkened.

&quot;Hai, child. That is where I am from. The temple is on the other side of 
the hill over there.&quot; She said, pointing in the direction she&#39;d just 
come from. Linna&#39;s heart skipped a beat at the news. &quot;But you must not 
go there child. Evil men have brought wickedness and corruption into the 
once sacred structure.&quot;

&quot;Wickedness and corruption... and the Emperor?&quot;

&quot;How... How do you...&quot;

&quot;That is why my friends and I are here, nun-sama. We&#39;ve come to rescue 
him.&quot;

&quot;Rescue? Oh child, it is impossible. They let no one in or out of the 
temple but the monks and nuns who tend it.&quot;

&quot;Really... hmmm... Nun-sama, do you have your razor on you?&quot;

&quot;Hai, child. That I do.&quot;

&quot;And do you have any nun&#39;s robes that would fit me in that basket?&quot;

&quot;Hai, child, I have that too.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;

The old nun suddenly realized what Linna was getting at. &quot;But, child, 
surely you&#39;re not thinking of...&quot;

Linna quickly walked into the small river, dunked her head in the water, 
and came back up. &quot;Start cutting.&quot; she said.

------

Priss turned over in the tent she and Linna shared. She reached over to 
put her arm around her love, when she realized Linna wasn&#39;t there. She 
bolted up, dressed, grabbed her dotanuki and ran out into the morning 
chill. Looking around, all she saw was Nene at the sentry post, fast 
asleep. She walked over and shook the blond girl awake.

&quot;Uh... Huh, wha... Who goes there?&quot;

&quot;Nene, you idiot, you fell asleep.&quot;

&quot;Hey, stop picking. I only rested for a second.&quot;

&quot;Good. Then did you see where Linna went off to?&quot;

&quot;Linna&#39;s gone?&quot;

&quot;Terrific.&quot; Priss growled, trying to keep her fear in check. She ran 
over to Sylia&#39;s tent, and shook the shoulder of the Knight Saber&#39;s 
leader.&quot;

&quot;We have a problem.&quot; Priss said, Sylia immediately picking up on the 
concern in her voice, &quot;Linna&#39;s missing.&quot;

Sylia grabbed a katana and ran out to join Priss. Nene was putting on 
her Knight Saber armor, when she spotted two bald-headed women in robes 
walking toward the camp.

&quot;Hey Sylia, we&#39;ve got company.&quot; she announced.

Sylia and Priss whirled around, swords at the ready. They both 
immediately relaxed when they saw what it was.

&quot;Nuns.&quot; Sylia said.

&quot;Wait here, I&#39;ll ask them if they&#39;ve seen her.&quot; Priss said, as she ran 
up to the two women. The older one saw Priss coming toward them and 
smiled.

&quot;Buddha bless...&quot;

&quot;Yeah yeah, whatever. Listen, a friend of ours is missing, someone very 
important. Have you seen a young woman who...&quot; her voice trailed off as 
she now saw the face of the other nun. 

In the several stages of promotion in the okiya from novice to maiko to 
geisha, the hairstyle each woman wore was used to denote what stage she 
was at. Linna was so proud the day she was allowed finally to wear her 
hair in the style of a mature geisha, she had told Priss the story maybe 
five or six times by now. Priss thought of this as she looked at her 
lover&#39;s shaved head.

&quot;Linna... Why?&quot; she asked, a tear starting to run down her cheek. Sylia 
and Nene were now equally shocked as they too recognized their fellow 
Knight Saber.

&quot;The temple is located on the other side of the hill across from the 
river. They let no one but monks and priests in or out. Try to 
understand, koibito (beloved), I had no choice. Not if we wish to get to 
the Emperor and the gun.&quot;

Priss tearfully cupped Linna&#39;s cheek in her hand, &quot;You should&#39;ve let me 
do this. You...&quot; Linna pulled Priss over and allowed her to cry on her 
shoulder. As she held her, she looked over at Sylia and motioned her to 
come over. She then turned her attention back to Priss.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t let you, Priss-chan. Don&#39;t you see; you&#39;re only half 
Japanese. In a Buddhist temple this far inland, you would&#39;ve stuck out 
like a sore thumb.&quot; Looking back over to Sylia, she took on a grave 
expression. &quot;Alright, sensei. What&#39;s the plan?&quot;

------

&quot;Why do we not attack them, sensei? Why do we continue to wait?&quot;

&quot;Because we&#39;re still waiting for her.&quot;

&quot;This was a bad idea,&quot; a third ninja complained, &quot;All this fuss about a 
single woman we&#39;re sending out...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t send her out.&quot; The leader of the hunting party declared, &quot;You 
aim her, and then you get the fuck out of the way.&quot;

&quot;We still don&#39;t know that she&#39;s even coming. We have yet to hear back 
from the apprentice.&quot;

&quot;You mean I beat him to you?&quot; a woman&#39;s voice asked from the woods. The 
other o-niwaban noticed their leader take a step back, a look of fear 
actually showing itself in his eyes. A woman of European descent wearing 
a tight-fitting corset now emerged from the forest into the clearing, 
carrying two large travel cases. 

&quot;Right, which one of you is the leader here?&quot; she asked in a low voice.

&quot;How... How did you manage to track us down? We were covering our tracks 
as we went along.&quot; A younger member of the o-niwaban Iga Clan asked.

Galatia smiled. &quot;If you knew me, you wouldn&#39;t have to ask. Now, who&#39;s in 
charge?&quot; she asked again, this time a bit more volume to her voice.

&quot;I am.&quot; The leader said, stepping forward.

&quot;Good.&quot; She said, &quot;Well, shall we get started?&quot;

------

&quot;Halt, who goes there?&quot;

&quot;Just two nuns, good sir, bringing back laundry.&quot;

&quot;Namu amida butsu.&quot; The younger one chanted, a string of prayer beads 
clutched in her hand.

&quot;Hmm... Right, go in, but don&#39;t try anything funny. Understand?&quot;

&quot;Yes, good sir. Of course, good sir.&quot;

&quot;...amida butsu. Namu amida...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good. They&#39;re nuns.&quot; He called to the guard, who allowed the two 
to enter the temple grounds. The younger one continued chanting, her 
robes hiding the dotanuki she had on her.

---To Be Continued---

End Notes: Alright, first off; I forgot to acknowledge Rezonating Out of 
Phase for telling me what Sempai meant. Also, yes, I got the idea for 
Linna disguising herself as a nun from a scene in The Seven Samurai.
