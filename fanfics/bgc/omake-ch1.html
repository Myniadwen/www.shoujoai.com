<pre>Sylia stingray paused as she saw Priss sleeping on the bed, then quietly 
closed the door. Walking back to her living room she saw Nene Romanova 
jump up from where the little hacker had been sitting and asked, &quot;Is she 
going to be all right?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got a lot of bumps and bruises and a partial fracture in her 
forearm. A few days rest and a cast and she&#39;ll be good as new,&quot; Sylia 
said briskly.

&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; Nene sighed. She groaned, &quot;Our target&#39;s gone, Priss is 
hurt and Linna&#39;s gone missing! Everything&#39;s going wrong.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Sylia said thoughtfully, &quot;but Linna&#39;s last transmission was 
near Irene Cheng&#39;s grave, and I think there must be a connection.&quot;

&quot;Do you want me to look into it?&quot; Nene asked.

&quot;Please,&quot; Sylia nodded.

Mackie Stingray returned from putting the medical supplies away, then 
the young man settled into a chair with a sigh, &quot;What a night.&quot;

&quot;Sylia...,&quot; Nene hesitated.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Sylia gave her a polite look.

&quot;If it&#39;s too much trouble, I can look after Priss at my place,&quot; Nene 
offered good naturedly.

&quot;No trouble,&quot; Sylia shook her head, &quot;besides, it might not be safe 
having her there or at a private hospital.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m sure we can sneak her into my place...,&quot; Nene started.

Sylia gave her a dangerous look, &quot;Priss stays here.&quot;

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Nene sat back, instantly recognizing Sylia&#39;s patented &#39;death 
gaze.&#39; Clearing her throat she said, &quot;Well, I&#39;d better get going.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; Sylia smiled, back in her regular cool mode. 
&quot;You can take Mackie along too, please.&quot;

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Nene whispered to Mackie as they took the 
elevator back to the Silky Doll lingerie shop.

&quot;You haven&#39;t noticed the way Sylia reacts around Priss?&quot; Mackie 
whispered back.

&quot;What?!&quot; Nene blurted.

Mackie positively smirked, &quot;I bet big sis is practically creaming her 
jeans having Priss weak and helpless in her care.&quot;

As Nene tried to wrap her brain around the idea she muttered, &quot;You&#39;re 
kidding.&quot;

&quot;Did you notice how quickly she volunteered to give Priss a sponge bath 
earlier?&quot; Mackie nodded wisely.

&quot;I almost feel sorry for leaving Priss in her hands,&quot; Nene said with a 
sigh as they left the building together.

&quot;Maybe so,&quot; Mackie shrugged, &quot;but I&#39;m not putting my life on the line to 
save her from my sister&#39;s clutches.&quot;

Nene nodded, &quot;Me too.&quot;

Later that week...

Sylia looked terribly apologetic, &quot;Priss, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;

The rangy brown haired woman turned in Sylia&#39;s loft, her one arm encased 
in a cast and dressed only in her bra and panties. &quot;Where the hell are 
my clothes?&quot; she asked.

&quot;You see, there seems to have been a problem at the cleaners,&quot; Sylia 
said apologetically, &quot;they&#39;ll have you items ready in a few days.&quot;

&quot;So I have to keep wearing these?&quot; Priss winced., gesturing to her 
mostly bare body.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Sylia said with a half smile, &quot;but I&#39;m sure I can find 
something downstairs that will fit.&quot;

&quot;What, from your lingerie shop?&quot; Priss blinked as Sylia hurried off.

Returning with several items on racks Sylia smiled as she held one up, 
&quot;I think these would look darling on you.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;s cover about the same amount of skin as a postage stamp,&quot; Priss 
noted dubiously.

Sylia&#39;s grin got wider, &quot;I know.&quot;</pre>
