the tone&#39;s a lot lighter than normal. Enjoy.
 
---December 25, 1880---
 
Sylia glared at the object in front of her, looking for anything she 
could&#39;ve missed. As she stalked around it, she suddenly saw what she was 
looking for.
 
&quot;Over here.&quot; she ordered Nene, &quot;Bring it over here.&quot;
 
Nene came over carrying the string of popcorn and berries, and Sylia 
placed it on the tree with a smile. The Christmas tree, a long standing 
tradition in Germany since the seventeenth century, first came to 
England in 1841 when Prince Albert and Queen Victoria decorated one in 
Windsor Castle. While a long way from England, Sylia found these 
reminders of her early childhood to be comforting. It was the first 
Christmas she and the others would be celebrating in the newly rebuilt 
Silky Doll, and Sylia wanted it to be one everyone would remember. She&#39;d 
placed the closed sign in the window, and rolled down the shades.
 
&quot;Nene?&quot; Sylia asked, &quot;What time is it?&quot;
 
Nene looked over to the grandfather clock as Mackie hung up garland and 
holly. &quot;Nine o&#39;clock.&quot; she said.
 
Sylia made a face. Her other two helpers were late, and she had a pretty 
good idea where they were.
 
------
 
Linna yawned as she opened her eyes, her nude body spooned up against 
that of Priss&#39;. Her head rested on her love&#39;s right arm as she felt her 
left arm draped around her waist. She sighed contentedly as she felt her 
partner&#39;s chest rise and fall with her breath. She reached down under 
the covers, stroking the back of Priss&#39; hand with her finger. From where 
she was laying, she could see the snow fall outside the window.
 
A kiss to the back of her neck told her Priss was up. She closed her 
eyes and smiled as she was hugged tighter from behind by the younger 
woman.
 
&quot;Koibito (beloved).&quot; her partner whispered as she nuzzled her face into 
Linna&#39;s neck. Linna took a deep breath, not wanting the moment to end. 
&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; she asked, tickling Linna&#39;s ear with her lips.
 
&quot;We have to go help Sensei decorate this morning.&quot; Linna said, &quot;And I&#39;m 
thinking of how cold it looks outside, and how warm I am with you here 
by me under the covers. I wish we could just stay like this.&quot;
 
Priss smiled as she kissed Linna on her earlobe. She then shifted her 
weight slightly, reaching her right hand around to gently cup Linna&#39;s 
left breast as she moved her other hand down her geisha&#39;s abdomen. Linna 
allowed a low throaty moan to escape her as Priss&#39; hand passed her navel 
and brushed against the first few hairs above her sex.
 
&quot;P... Priss, I... Aaaaa.... we&#39;re supposed to go to Sensei&#39;s this 
morning to...&quot; she stopped and gasped as her love began to stroke her 
inner thigh, massaging her breast as she did so.
 
&quot;It&#39;s still early, hon.&quot; Priss said, eliciting a tiny squeal from Linna 
as she lightly twisted on her hardened nipple, &quot;And besides, you want 
this as much as I do.&quot; she added before sliding the hand up her inner 
thigh, where her beloved&#39;s already excited sex awaited her. She began to 
rub back and forth across Linna&#39;s now wet folds, kissing her along the 
back of her jawline. Linna began to moan as Priss continued to massage 
her sex with her hand, making sure to rub her swollen bud as she did so. 
Linna arched her back against Priss and draped her leg back across her 
love&#39;s as her partner slid two fingers into her, going back and forth in 
a rhythm she&#39;d learned from months of physical contact.
 
Linna reached behind to grab Priss&#39; thigh as she thrust her pelvis in 
rhythm with her love&#39;s fingers. She tilted her head back and met Priss&#39; 
lips. As their tongues intertwined, Priss could feel her geisha&#39;s 
muscles begin to contract around her fingers, and her body begin to go 
rigid.
 
Linna pulled her mouth away to cry out as her body stiffened up against 
her lover&#39;s. As she closed her eyes and rode out the waves of her 
orgasm, her love&#39;s fingers continuing their rhythm, she could feel 
Priss&#39; breath against her neck. The last shudders over, Priss turned her 
geisha around so they were facing, and hugged her tightly to herself. 
Linna, her arms brought up against her chest, smiled wearily. After all 
the heartbreaks, all the tears, she was here, in the strong comforting 
arms of the woman she loved.
 
They stayed like that for several minutes, neither wanting to break 
contact. Finally Priss kissed her lightly on the forehead, and looked at 
her sadly. &quot;Linna, I hate to say this, but we should get dressed now 
hon. You know how Sylia can get.&quot;
 
Linna, now recovered a bit, flashed a grin as she suddenly tilted the 
woman she loved onto her back.
 
&quot;It&#39;s still early, remember? And besides,&quot; she said, lowering her voice 
as she did a bad impersonation of Priss&#39; voice, &quot;You want this as much 
as I do...&quot;
 
---One Hour Later---
 
Priss held the door open for Linna, whose eyes widened at the scene in 
front of her. She&#39;d never seen European Christmas decorations growing up 
in the okiya in Kyoto. On the tree near the back of the Silky Doll were 
bows, origami swans and stars, candles, sticks of cinnamon, and popcorn 
strings. Garlands and holly hung from the walls, and there was some sort 
of a plant with red berries hanging by a string in the center of the 
store.
 
Priss took the gifts from Linna&#39;s hands as she continued to look around, 
and placed them under the tree with her own. Mackie and Nene were 
sipping eggnog from a punchbowl on the counter as Sylia came out of the 
back room carrying a decorated wreath.
 
&quot;You two are late.&quot; she gently scolded before cracking a smile. &quot;But 
I&#39;ll let it go this time. Here, I saved this for you.&quot; she said as she 
passed the wreath to Linna. The former geisha, having only a very 
rudimentary understanding of the holiday season, suddenly looked like 
she was about to cry.
 
&quot;For... for me?&quot; she asked, her voice choked with emotion. &quot;Oh, Sensei, 
I don&#39;t know what to say, I...&quot; she was going to say more, but Nene&#39;s 
laughter cut her off.
 
&quot;It&#39;s not a gift, silly.&quot; she managed to get out. &quot;It&#39;s a decoration. 
You put it on the outside of the door.&quot;
 
Linna looked down as she blushed in embarrassment. Sylia put a 
comforting hand on her shoulder.
 
&quot;That&#39;s okay.&quot; she said, &quot;If you like it that much, you can have it 
after the holiday season.&quot;
 
Linna smiled gratefully at her, &quot;Thank you Sensei.&quot; she said as Mackie 
passed her and Priss some eggnog. As they walked back across the room, 
Linna started to follow, only to be stopped by her partner when she 
stepped underneath the plant hanging from the ceiling. Turning around to 
question, she found Priss&#39; lips pressed to hers. Pulling back, Priss met 
her inquisitive gaze and smiled.
 
&quot;Mistletoe.&quot; she said, pointing up toward the leaves. &quot;It&#39;s a tradition 
the gaijin came up with to act like chikan (perverts) once a year.&quot;
 
&quot;Don&#39;t listen to her.&quot; Sylia said. &quot;The tradition is that, if someone is 
standing under the mistletoe, you kiss them. Of course,&quot; she added, 
looking pointedly at Priss, &quot;Normally it&#39;s only on the cheek.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey everyone.&quot; Nene interrupted, coming over with Mackie. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve 
been working hard with Mackie, and he&#39;s been improving on his Japanese.&quot; 
Switching to English, she said something to him as she nudged him 
forward. Mackie looked nervous as he tried to remember what he&#39;d 
learned.
 
&quot;Onesan (big sister).&quot; he said, pointing to Sylia. &quot;Tomodachi (friend).&quot; 
he said as he then looked at Linna. When he looked at Priss, he suddenly 
drew a blank. Searching his brain, he finally remembered a phrase he&#39;d 
heard his girlfriend use a few times in reference to the young woman.
 
&quot;Otoko-onna (man-woman, i.e. a butch).&quot; he said with a smile as he 
pointed at her.
 
Nene&#39;s face went beet red as she quickly covered Mackie&#39;s mouth, looking 
apologetically around the room. Saying something quickly to him in 
English, all the color drained from his face as he realized what he&#39;d 
just said. Priss raised an eyebrow as she looked from Mackie to Nene.
 
&quot;You may want to work with him a bit longer before you present him to 
the general public.&quot; she suggested as both Linna and Sylia snickered 
behind her.
 
---Later---
 
&quot;Sylia, what&#39;s this stuff again?&quot; Priss asked, eyeing her plate 
suspiciously.
 
&quot;It&#39;s a traditional Christmas treat. It&#39;s called plum pudding.&quot; she said 
as Linna began to sample her dish. On the other side of the room, Mackie 
and Nene were talking.
 
&quot;Sorry, hon.&quot; Mackie said, &quot;I guess I really fouled up, huh?&quot;
 
Nene smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. You really are coming along fine, 
though. Between me and your sister, we&#39;ll get you speaking Japanese like 
an Oriental in no time.&quot; she said, giving him a quick peck on the cheek. 
Linna looked over from her vantage point and smiled; they really were a 
kawaii couple.
 
Looking up at the clock, Sylia stepped to the center of the room
 
&quot;Sorry to spoil everyone&#39;s fun,&quot; she began, &quot;But we&#39;re going to have to 
wrap this up soon; I have plans to be with Nigel later, and Mackie and 
Nene are going to the theater to see a kabuki play.&quot;
 
Nene looked questioningly over to Mackie. &quot;What&#39;s this about kabuki?&quot; 
she asked. Mackie grinned as he produced two tickets from his vest.
 
&quot;Merry Christmas, hon.&quot; he said. Nene hugged him gratefully before 
kissing him softly on the lips.
 
Linna got up and grabbed two packages from under the tree. She passed 
one to Priss and the other to Nene.
 
&quot;Your gift is from me.&quot; Linna said to Nene. She opened it to reveal a 
hand knit scarf and hat, both pink.
 
&quot;Oh, Linna... they&#39;re beautiful.&quot; she gushed. Priss took the other 
package and passed it to Sylia.
 
&quot;This is yours.&quot; Priss said. From the corner of her eye, Sylia could see 
Linna bury her face in her hand out of embarrassment. Shaking her head, 
she opened her gift to reveal...
 
&quot;Brass knuckles?&quot; she asked, looking at the object. Priss smiled.
 
&quot;I knew you&#39;d like them. I got them from a sailor. I figured that, in a 
close fighting situation...&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, thank you... Thank you very much Priss.&quot; she said, trying them on 
to make Priss happy. It was the thought that counted, after all. And 
given their personal history, the very fact that Priss was able to bring 
herself to give Sylia any gift meant a great deal to her.
 
Besides; Priss was right. She really could do some serious damage with 
the weapon in a close fighting situation.
 
Sylia next gave her gifts to Priss and Linna. They each received a gold 
necklace with half a Japanese character hanging from it. When put 
together, it spelled ai (love). She gave Nene a warm fur stole, and 
Mackie an English to Japanese dictionary. And Nene gave everyone 
handkerchiefs she&#39;d embroidered with their names on them.
 
The hour getting late, Priss and Linna took their leave. As Nene and 
Mackie were walking out, the young Russian felt a hand on her shoulder. 
Turning around, she saw Sylia looking at her. &quot;Go on ahead, Mackie.&quot; The 
leader of the Knight Sabers said, &quot;Nene will be with you in a second.&quot;
 
Mackie looked at her sister inquisitively; there was something about the 
way she said it. Sylia looked over to her brother and smiled.
 
&quot;It&#39;s okay; she&#39;s not in any trouble. She&#39;ll be right out.&quot; she said 
with a smile. He nodded and followed the other two out into the December 
snow. Nene looked up nervously.
 
&quot;Sylia, if it&#39;s about what Mackie said earlier about Priss...&quot; she 
stopped when she found Sylia&#39;s finger against her lips.
 
&quot;Nene,&quot; Sylia said, suddenly looking very serious as she looked into the 
younger woman&#39;s blue-green eyes, &quot;Remember when we were in the forest, 
and I said something about if I weren&#39;t with Nigel and you weren&#39;t with 
Mackie?&quot;
 
Nene nodded, looking at her curiously. Sylia took her finger away from 
the Russian&#39;s lips and pointed up to the ceiling.
 
There, directly above the young blond, was the mistletoe.
 
Before Nene had time to react, she found Sylia&#39;s lips pressed against 
hers, her shoulders held in her leader&#39;s grip. She tensed up, nervous 
and fearful at first. She then closed her eyes, taking in a deep breath 
as she relaxed her body a bit. Sylia took the opportunity to wrap her 
arms around her, cradling the back of her head as she did so. When Nene 
opened her mouth to say something, Sylia took it as an invitation and 
slid her tongue into her mouth. Nene tensed up again for a second, 
before once more relaxing into the kiss. She found herself meeting 
Sylia&#39;s tongue with her own, even as she wrapped her own arms around the 
taller woman.
 
Finally separating, Sylia looked down at the blond with the full lips 
and the cute little button nose, and smiled.
 
&quot;You should probably get going now, or Mackie might get worried. And 
I&#39;ve got to go to Nigel&#39;s or I&#39;ll never hear the end of it.&quot;
 
Nene took a step or two back, trying to catch her breath as she nodded. 
As she turned around, Sylia called after her.
 
&quot;So, same time next year?&quot; she joked. Nene looked back at her, a dazed 
look in her eyes. Sylia smirked.
 
&quot;Relax, I&#39;m only kidding. Incidentally,&quot; she asked, &quot;just out of 
curiosity, how would you rate my kissing compared to Mackie&#39;s?&quot;
 
Nene tilted her head a bit as she regarded the woman in front of her. 
&quot;Not sure; Mackie usually doesn&#39;t stick his tongue quite that far into 
my mouth.&quot;
 
The tension in the room left as they both began laughing. Nene then left 
to join Mackie, followed closely by Sylia, who stopped long enough to 
lock up before she left for the Kirkland Stables.</pre>
