<h1>A Few Steps More (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/fewstepsmore-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Note: Okay, I went back to an older story of mine and updated it for 
inclusion here in this series. It was originally inspired by the story 
Dear Mom by JHedge all about a foreigner who moves into an office across 
from the Silky Doll, and how she begins to notice unusual goings-on 
across the street. The idea of an outsider looking in somehow triggered 
something in me, and this was the result. It&#39;s a bit different, so bear 
with me.

-Prologue-

He rubbed his hands together as he tried to keep them warm. While 
everyone else was back at the den slowly getting stoned, he was out here 
hiding in an alley across the street from a women&#39;s clothing store. The 
street gang he was a member of had been putting pressure on local 
businesses to give them protection money. Most of the mom and pop places 
around this district, as well as some of the swankier stores, had 
immediately given in to the thugs.

Most, but not her.

She didn&#39;t look like so much on the outside; just some stuck-up bitch 
that ran a place called the Silky Doll. He could still remember going 
into the place with three other gang members when there were no 
customers around and she was alone. It should have been simple; put a 
little scare into her, then collect the dough.

Instead, she listened to their threats with what could only be described 
as amusement. His friend Takoshi finally had enough of her attitude and 
decided to teach the rich bitch a lesson. He stepped forward and went to 
backhand her. Before Takoshi even knew what was happening though, she&#39;d 
grabbed a hold of his wrist and twisted, breaking his arm with a 
sickening crack. She then moved swiftly, kicking another square in his 
manhood with those damned high-heels of hers before knocking his third 
friend out cold with a roundhouse kick to the face.

As he took a bite of his chocolate bar, he winced as a peanut lodged 
itself in the gap where his molar used to be before that damned whore 
knocked it out with her fist. To add insult to injury, she called the 
cops on them after she&#39;d incapacitated him and his friends. He was the 
only one able to somehow stagger away before the Tokyo PD got there.

Which brought him back to the present, shivering in an alleyway across 
from the Silky Doll. He&#39;d make her pay. He didn&#39;t know how, but he 
would.

Suddenly he saw movement. The door opened and the bitch came out with 
two other women. One looked like a cute brunette who hadn&#39;t been in the 
city for long, while the other looked like a badass in motorcycle 
leather. The tough-looking one got on a red motorcycle, put her bike 
helmet on, and did a small wheelie as she rode out. The stuck-up broad 
and the brunette then went back inside. The owner locked the door, 
turned to the other woman with a smile and...

His eyes widened as he watched the two women kiss. It was a brief kiss, 
just a simple peck on the lips, but the way they held hands afterwards 
as they walked away told him it was far from a friendship kiss. As the 
lights in the Silky Doll went out, he smiled broadly.

He now knew how to make her pay.

-Story II-

-Outing-

Airman First Class Rachel Brown was not having a good week.

The young woman arrived at the American Air Force base just outside Mega 
Tokyo five days ago and found that, while her bags with her military 
uniforms arrived safe and sound, her luggage with her civilian clothes 
and lingerie was lost. She&#39;d been wearing the same bra and panties for 
close to a week now, forced to wash them each night in order to put them 
on again the next morning.

Worse, she was having a harder time with the language than she had at 
first anticipated, causing her to self-consciously carry around a 
Japanese phrase book and dictionary with her every time she left the 
base. To top everything off, her social skills hadn&#39;t improved any since 
before joining the Air Force. She was still shy around others, and it 
still took her a while to open up to new people. As a result, she had 
yet to make any new friends in Mega Tokyo.

Today, the first leave she&#39;d been given since arriving at Japan, she was 
planning on taking care of at least one of her problems. She needed 
bras, panties, and civilian clothes. After getting up the nerve to ask 
some of the other women at the base, she was directed to a store a short 
ways away from the base called the Silky Doll. Putting on her best 
dress-uniform and tying her sandy blonde hair back in a simple ponytail, 
she headed out in the chill of the January morning.

On the Tokyo metro she could feel the stares of everyone looking at her 
in her military uniform. Self-consciously exiting the subway, she looked 
once again at the directions she&#39;d been given and began to walk due 
east. After about ten minutes she came around a corner and finally saw 
the building. As she started to come up to it however, she frowned when 
she realized something was wrong.

She passed a police car parked in front of the building next to the 
sidewalk. Coming up to the building, she saw some sort of graphitti 
spray painted in large Japanese characters on the front store window. As 
she stared at it, wishing she could read Japanese, a short-haired young 
Japanese woman exited the building with a bucket of soapy water. She was 
soon joined by an elderly gentleman with a ponytail. As the two began 
work scrubbing the graphitti from the glass front of the building, a cop 
came out of the entrance followed by an elegantly-dressed woman who was 
clearly not happy.

The silver-haired woman&#39;s face switched from looking sad to angry as she 
was talking to the officer, her voice intense. As the cop took down 
information in his small book, Rachel began to feel uncomfortable and 
out of place. She was about to leave when the woman turned away from the 
police officer and noticed her standing there. For a few seconds both 
she and Rachel just stood there looking at one another silently. Then, 
the woman smiled as pleasantly as possible under the circumstances.

&quot;Ohayo gozaimasu,&quot; she said, wishing the American a good morning as 
behind her the officer walked back to the squad car. Rachel quickly 
pulled out her phrasebook as she tried to remember the proper response. 
The silver-haired woman noticed the book and raised an eyebrow.

&quot;You speak English?&quot; she asked in a thick Japanese accent that made it 
sound more like &quot;Engrish.&quot;

&quot;Oh, um, yes. Do you understand English?&quot;

&quot;A little,&quot; she answered, &quot;But my speaking is not very good.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I think you sound fine,&quot; Rachel said, noticing the happy look she 
received for the complement. &quot;Are you open yet?&quot;

The woman looked over to the two scrubbing away at the graphitti, then 
back at Rachel.

&quot;Hai. We&#39;re open, Miss...&quot;

&quot;Rachel Brown,&quot; she answered, &quot;And your name is?&quot;

&quot;Stingray Sylia-desu. You may call me Sylia.&quot;

As they went in, Rachel noticed out of the corner of her eye a 
motorcycle pulling up to the front of the store. Inside, she noticed a 
young blond who was wearing shorts, leggings, and a jacket over her 
belly shirt. As the blond noticed Rachel, she looked surprised. She 
asked Sylia something with an incredulous tone to her voice. Sylia said 
something back to her that caused her to look down, nod, and go into the 
back stock room.

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;No, my friend is thinking I should not be opening today.&quot; Sylia said, 
pointing with her finger at the graphitti in the front window.

&quot;Oh. Miss Stingray, if today&#39;s a bad day...&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; she answered forcefully. As she noticed the look on Rachel&#39;s face, 
she took a deep breath and calmed down. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said softly, 
&quot;But if I closed today, it would mean that they won. Now, what are you 
looking for?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the young woman answered hesitantly, &quot;I need some bras, panties, 
and...&quot;

Before Rachel could go any further, the door of the Silky Doll was flung 
open by an incredibly angry looking woman in a biker outfit. As she 
waved her arms, pointing at the graphitti and punching her fist into her 
palm, she looked like she was ready to kill somebody. In the midst of 
her yelling, she noticed the American. She looked as surprised at seeing 
Rachel there as the blonde had earlier, and turned to Sylia as she 
seemed to ask something. Sylia, for her part getting calmer the angrier 
the other woman got, answered her in a quiet tone. The biker then looked 
back at the American.

&quot;Sumi masen,&quot; she muttered before turning away and heading for the back 
stock room, passing the blond Rachel saw earlier as she was coming out. 
The blond had a soda in her hand now, and was leaning up with her back 
against the counter. The main door opened once more, and the short 
haired woman came in carrying a bucket full of now dirty water. Rachel, 
who was already feeling very nervous and out of place in the 
tension-filled atmosphere, watched as the woman started talking with 
Sylia. The silver-haired store owner said something back as Rachel 
caught the glint of an engagement ring on the brunette&#39;s finger. She 
then turned back to Rachel.

&quot;I am sorry for these... how do you say it... &#39;Interruptions?&#39;&quot; Sylia 
explained rather apologetically, &quot;Things are usually not like this. Why 
don&#39;t you just look around and see what you like.&quot;

Rachel noticed the biker woman coming back into the room with a coffee 
in her hand, shortly thereafter followed by a teenage boy wearing a 
headband. &quot;Miss Stingray?&quot; Rachel finally asked, &quot;I hope you don&#39;t take 
offense, but exactly what is written out front? It must be awful if 
everyone is this upset over it.&quot;

Sylia&#39;s expression was hard to read as she studied the American. 
Finally, she let out a sigh, &quot;Why not,&quot; she finally said defeatedly, 
&quot;You&#39;ll find out one way or another anyways, I&#39;m sure. I don&#39;t know the 
English, but in Japanese the one says, &#39;rezu&#39; and the other, &#39;gomora.&#39;&quot;

Rachel noticed the pained, angry reactions in the hearers, especially 
upon hearing the second sign read aloud. The brunette with the short 
hair started to cry. Sylia pulled her to her shoulder, gently rubbing 
her hair as Rachel opened her Japanese dictionary. She found the 
definitions of &quot;rezu&quot; and &quot;gomora,&quot; and gasped as the color drain from 
her face.

&quot;Rezu, a derogatory term for a lesbian. Roughly equivalent to the 
English word dyke.&quot;

&quot;Gomora, extremely offensive term for a lesbian, comes from &quot;Gomorrah&quot; 
as in &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah.&quot;

She now understood everything. &quot;Somebody outed you,&quot; she whispered as 
she looked up from the book back over to Sylia and the woman silently 
weeping on her shoulder. The biker narrowed her eyes as she glared at 
Rachel, almost as if she was daring her to try and hurt her friends in 
front of her. The others likewise seemed prepared to either watch the 
American leave upon finding out Sylia was a lesbian, or to come to her 
defense should Rachel say something insulting to her.

Instead, the American Airman said the last thing anyone would&#39;ve 
expected.

&quot;Miss Stingray,&quot; Rachel began, looking down at the floor, &quot;do you have 
an extra bucket and washcloth?&quot;

Sylia&#39;s look of shock at first alarmed the others. She quickly reassured 
them, before turning back to her customer, &quot;Why?&quot; she asked.

Rachel took a deep breath as she gathered up her courage and looked back 
at Sylia.

&quot;Well, I have the day off anyways. Besides,&quot; she added softly as she 
pointed at herself, &quot;I&#39;m a rezu too.&quot;

---Evening---

A group of thugs laughed as they gathered around a garbage can filled 
with burning wood and paper in an alleyway, their bodies illuminated by 
the fire and a nearby streetlamp. As the members of the street gang 
warmed their hands by the fire, one of the members who was missing a 
molar spoke up.

&quot;Ha, ha... did you... did you see the look on her face?&quot;

&quot;Yeah... Ha, ha, ha... it was priceless...&quot;

&quot;Serves the dirty cunt right!&quot; their leader sneered, &quot;Now maybe she&#39;ll 
pay up!&quot;

&quot;So what do we do now, Ken?&quot; a fourth member asked.

&quot;Stupid, what do you think?&quot; the leader responded, &quot;Now, we hit her up 
for money again of course! I&#39;ll bet the dirty dyke won&#39;t be so high and 
mighty this time either.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; the one with the missing molar agreed, adding, &quot;And if she still 
won&#39;t play ball, I got a good look at her girlfriend. Maybe if her slut 
had an accident...&quot; his voice died off as he and the others heard a thud 
up on one of the roofs above them, followed by several more, &quot;What the 
hell was that?&quot;

Before anyone had time to answer, something green and moving incredibly 
fast shot down at them from above, ribbon cutters trailing behind the 
figure cutting through the top of the nearby street lamp. The green 
figure landed only seconds before the severed lamp did. As it turned 
around to look at the street gang, panic ensued.

&quot;Shit!&quot;

&quot;What the fuck?&quot;

&quot;Knight Sabers? I thought they were only interested in boomers!&quot;

The green Knight Saber stood between the members of the gang and the end 
of the alley, effectively cutting off the route as an exit. The group 
quickly turned, any thought of sticking up to the armored figure as a 
group quickly set aside as an every man for himself mentality set in. 
They began running away from her, hoping to somehow make it out the 
other end of the alley before she could stop them.

Those hopes were crushed however when a group of long, razor sharp 
needles were fired into the ground in front of them. A second Knight 
Saber, in pink armor, soon landed between them and the other escape 
route.

&quot;Oh God, oh shit...&quot; the youngest gang member started whimpering as the 
leader of the group, Ken, reached into his coat pocket. It was then that 
the blue and silver Knight Sabers landed, joining the other two. The 
four of them began to slowly close in around the group.

&quot;Which one of you ass holes is the leader here?&quot; The blue Knight Saber 
asked.

Ken pulled his hand out of his pocket, revealing a hand gun. He aimed it 
at the Knight Saber, only to have the silver one extend a sword and, 
with one quick movement, slice the end of the gun off. She then grabbed 
him by the shirt collar and lifted him off the ground one handed.

&quot;Word on the streets is you and your friends are trying to shake down a 
woman in the other end of the city,&quot; she growled, not even trying to 
mask her rage.

&quot;You know the one we&#39;re talking about,&quot; the green Knight Saber broke in, 
&quot;runs a women&#39;s clothing store, likes to wear large bows in the back of 
her hair.&quot;

&quot;Hey, it wasn&#39;t our idea, man!&quot; One of the gang members cried, shaking 
all over from fear, &quot;It was Ken there,&quot; he shouted as he pointed as the 
frightened man still dangling above the ground by his shirt collar, &quot;He 
made us do it! We never wanted to spray paint anything...&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; The blue Knight Saber yelled, punching a hole in the wall 
behind the terror stricken goon.

&quot;You see,&quot; the silver Knight Saber hissed as she pulled Ken&#39;s face up to 
her armored faceplate, &quot;the owner of that store has some powerful 
friends. Friends like us.&quot;

&quot;And we have better things to do with our time than waste it pummeling 
you bone heads,&quot; the pink one chimed in. &quot;So, if I were you, and if I 
wanted to see tomorrow, I&#39;d back off and leave her and her friends 
alone. In fact,&quot; she added as she held up a finger like a teacher giving 
a naughty pupil a lecture, &quot;While you&#39;re at it, you might want to give 
up crime altogether. Understand?&quot;

&quot;Uh... Uh... Understood.&quot; Ken finally managed to get out. The silver 
Knight Saber dropped him to the ground, and the four of them then 
launched themselves into the night sky, leaving the badly shaken street 
gang alone in the darkened alley.

---The Next Day---

Rachel had given up a few hours ago on getting the paint out from under 
her fingernails. She still couldn&#39;t believe someone would be mean enough 
to do that to the nice lady and her partner she met yesterday. With a 
blush she also realized she couldn&#39;t believe how much she&#39;d revealed 
about herself yesterday as she talked to the Sylia while they both 
worked side-by-side scrubbing away with the others at the filthy words 
left on the storefront. She was normally so shy and introverted, yet 
somehow Sylia&#39;s manner put her at ease. She&#39;d talked about her 
childhood, leaving home at seventeen, her first date with a girl, and 
how she joined the Air Force last year.

She kept worrying about boring the store owner. After all, she had quite 
a refined air about her, an aura of prim elegance and sophistication. 
Instead of being put off by her however, Sylia showed a genuine interest 
in her ramblings. The way she looked at her when she talked, it was like 
Rachel was the only one there; she never got the feeling that she was 
being humored or patronized. With her permission, Sylia turned every so 
often to her lover and translated what she was saying into Japanese.

Looking back, Rachel found the whole experience very cathartic. It was 
true, she guessed; it really was sometimes easier to open up to 
strangers.

It took nearly three hours of scrubbing, but they finally managed to get 
the disgusting graphitti off the windows. Sylia had tried to give Rachel 
something for helping her and her friends. She declined of course, 
saying something cornball about the sisterhood sticking together. It 
wasn&#39;t until she got back to her apartment at the base that she realized 
with annoyance that she forgot to get the clothes and lingerie she 
needed.

As she was about to fix herself a can of chicken soup, her phone rang.

&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Miss Brown,&quot; a male voice said, &quot;You have some visitors, a Miss 
Stingray and Miss Yamazaki. Will you vouch for them so I can allow them 
onto the base?&quot;

&quot;Miss Stingray?&quot; Rachel asked in surprise, &quot;Yes, yes of course. I&#39;ll 
vouch for them,&quot; she said happily. A few minutes later, she heard a 
knock at her door. She quickly opened it and saw Sylia and her partner 
both smiling back at her. As they bowed in greeting to her, she noticed 
that the store owner was carrying a large shopping bag, while the 
brunette with her held onto a large covered bowl.

&quot;Komban wa,&quot; Sylia said warmly, &quot;After you left yesterday, I remembered 
you needed some clothes. You wouldn&#39;t take any money, so I thought I&#39;d 
just repay you another way.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you.&quot; Rachel gasped, a bit overwhelmed at the gesture, &quot;But 
you didn&#39;t have to do this...&quot;

&quot;Yes, but how do you say, &#39;the sisterhood sticks together.&#39;&quot;

They both laughed at that. Sylia&#39;s partner reminded her of something, 
and Sylia then turned back to Rachel.

&quot;We also brought dinner for you. Unless you had other plans...&quot; she said 
as she noticed the can of &quot;Chicken and Stars&quot; the American was about to 
open sitting on the counter.

&quot;No, no other plans,&quot; Rachel quickly answered, adding, &quot;Thank you very 
much. Here, the table&#39;s right there. Let me get you some seats and 
plates. By the way,&quot; she said hesitantly, &quot;I&#39;m terrible with names. 
What&#39;s your partner&#39;s name again? Lydia-san?&quot;

&quot;Linna,&quot; the young lady in question corrected, &quot;Yamasaki Linna-desu.&quot;

&quot;Linna-san? Okay, I can remember that. What did you want to drink with 
dinner? I&#39;ve got some local beer...&quot;

&quot;No, no beer.&quot; Sylia answered a bit forcefully, adding, &quot;I&#39;m an 
alcoholic.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Do you like diet soda?&quot;

&quot;Diet soda sounds good.&quot; Sylia said, once again relaxing.

Over dinner, they talked about recent events in the news, annoying 
customers, lecherous managers, and sadistic Air Force officers. Linna 
and Rachel argued good naturedly over who was worse, Linna&#39;s boomer 
supervisor or Rachel&#39;s drill sergeant in boot camp, with Sylia acting as 
translator.

After dinner (and an after-dinner coffee), Sylia and Linna took their 
leave, promising to stay in touch with the young Airman First Class. As 
Rachel closed the door behind them, she smiled. Maybe Japan wasn&#39;t going 
to be so bad after all.

---The End---

End Notes: Hopefully I was able to keep this from becoming too much of a 
Mary Sue story :P Derogatory terminology came from the book Japanese 
Street Slang by Peter Constantine.

Ohayo gozaimasu- Good morning

Sumi masen- Sorry
