<h1>After the Crash (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sylia Stingray gestured towards the couches with a
bandaged arm as she said tiredly, &quot;Grab a seat,
everyone.&quot;

&quot;Sylia, are you sure you don&#39;t want us to take you to
the hospital?&quot; Nene Romanova asked, looking at her
with gentle concern.

&quot;Linna did a good job bandaging me up,&quot; Sylia said
mildly as she saw Linna Yamazaki blush faintly, &quot;I
think it should be fine.&quot;

&quot;You want something to drink?&quot; Linna asked, deciding
to change the subject a moment. When the others agreed
on tea she bustled into the kitchen quickly preparing
a pot and bringing it in with cream, sugar and lemon.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sylia smiled from where she was sitting
on one of the couches, the black haired woman letting
her bandaged up left forearm rest gently on her lap.
She was dressed very out of her typical style that
afternoon, instead of her regular business wear she
was dressed in a slightly battered T-shirt and a pair
of sweatpants. With her right hand she slowly sipped
at her cup of tea even as she looked up at the three
other women in the room.

The spacious, comfortably designed living room had
plenty of places for guests to sit down, but as usual
Priss Asagiri leaned up against the wall in a simple
T-shirt and jeans and a sullen expression on her
handsome face. Both a still business-suited Linna and
the much more casually dressed Nene sat there
fidgeting nervously across from Sylia on the room&#39;s
other large couch, even as the oppressive tension
built in the room.

Sylia drank a bit more of her cup of tea as she sat
there silently and patiently waited for one of the
three to speak up, waited to see if they would be able
to get up the nerve to ask her about what they had all
seen back in the hardsuit&#39;s repair bay.

On reflection it had been a stupid mistake, the kind
of error that someone like Sylia Stingray didn&#39;t
normally let herself make. The Knight Sabers had been
less active lately, with Genom laying low due to the
fallout of the Largo affair, but that was no excuse
for what happened. Sylia was performing a
demonstration on a hardsuit mock-up that she had
built, patiently explaining to them how to get the
pilot out of one of them if there was a total and
absolute failure of every major system. As well as all
of the emergency back-ups, of course. Above all else
Sylia wanted them to be prepared, well aware of the
dangers I their chosen occupation.

Sylia was showing them how to use a powered
micro-blade to cut through the chest unit&#39;s main
connections and then pop the suit&#39;s seals to get the
pilot out, when the blade slipped on the smooth
surface of the outer armor shell. Everything seemed to
go into slow motion then as they all heard the loud
scrape along the shell, an eerily familiar soft sound
of flesh tearing, then the shocking sound of metal on
metal.

Unable to stand the silence any longer, Nene suddenly
blurted out the question, &#147;What are you?&#148; The
redheaded girl blushed furiously, realizing what it
sounded like, but she looked up defiantly to meet
Sylia&#39;s eyes.

&#147;Nene!&#148; a shocked Linna quickly scolded her friend,
the dark brown haired woman going so far as to clap
her hand over the shorter redhead&#39;s mouth. &#147;That was
so rude!&#148; she said, looking up at Sylia in apology.

&#147;It&#39;s all right,&#148; a serious Sylia said softly to
Linna, holding up her uninjured hand to stop a
possible fight. &#147;I guess I should have told all of you
about this a long time ago,&#148; she admitted, a finger
nervously stroking the bandage. She held up her
injured arm and stated, &#147;You saw metal there, when I
accidentally cut my arm.&#148;

Linna and Nene nodded and Priss just grunted loudly.
The brown haired woman was keeping her distance still,
an unreadable look in her dark eyes. There was a
tension in her lean body too, almost as if she was
fighting the urge to flee.

&#147;Did you have the bones in your arm replaced?&#148; Linna
asked Sylia gently. &#147;Maybe because of some injury you
had?&#148;

&#147;No, not... exactly,&#148; Sylia answered her, smiling a
bit sadly as she considered what to say. And more
importantly, how to say it.

&quot;Sylia?&quot; Nene prompted gently.

Taking a deep breath, she launched into what was by
the sound of it almost certainly a long prepared
speech, one that she had begun to consider making a
very long time ago. &#147;You all know about my father and
his development of the early boomer prototypes,&quot; Sylia
said gravely. &quot;What you may not know, is that he was
also interested in developing a method of using
boomer-like technologies on the human body. Not
necessarily in replacing specific organs, but instead
helping to improve the body&#39;s overall function.&#148;

Priss&#39; eyes narrowed slightly, almost as if the singer
knew, or could guess what was coming. Sylia looked up
a moment to see how they were taking it, and was
encouraged by the interest in their eyes. &quot;I heard
about Boomeroid biotech,&quot; Linna murmured, &quot;but nothing
like this.&quot;

Sylia shook her head ruefully as she said &#147;In my
teens, I was willing to do almost anything to destroy
Genom and strike back at Quincy, even taking the
substantial risk of using my own father&#39;s experimental
technology on myself.&#148;

&#147;What exactly did you do?&#148; Nene asked her rather
breathlessly, already beginning to wonder what that
technology could do for a cyperpunk like herself!

Sylia spoke softly, in a very detached, almost
scientific tone as she explained, &#147;The majority of my
bones, including the leg, arm, spine and skull, are
reinforced by a extremely durable but lightweight
titanium alloy. I&#39;m stronger, and my reflexes are much
faster than any normal human&#39;s are. A slight change in
my brain&#39;s chemistry helped triple my processing speed
and increased my mental capacity as well,&#148; Sylia said
softly.

Sylia stopped speaking and cautiously looked up from
her tea to see their reactions. Linna and Nene looked
all right, a bit shocked, but still all right. But
Priss wasn&#39;t handling it so well, going by the shocked
expression on her handsome face.

Priss looked across the room at Sylia, obviously
appalled by what she had heard. &#147;So to fight Genom you
turned yourself into some kind of boomer?!&#148; she
yelled, gesturing wildly.

&#147;No I didn&#39;t, Priss,&#148; Sylia said in her normally calm
tones, even though she was cringing inside at the look
of disgust on Priss&#39;s face.

&#147;It&#39;s close enough,&#148; Priss bit out angrily to her,
then she picked up her leather jacket and left the
room, loudly slamming the door behind her.

&#147;Priss, wait!&#148; Nene shouted as the door slammed shut,
half getting up from the couch to go after her and try
to bring her back.

&#147;No, Nene,&#148; Sylia said softly, &#147;let her go.&#148; She
sighed softly, and as she shook her head said &#147;I was
almost expecting her to react like that.&#148;

Linna was shaking her head too as she murmured, &#147;Even
after everything that happened with Sylvie, she just
can&#39;t seem to get over it.&#148;

Sylia almost winced but she tried to not let it show.
The knowledge that Priss and Sylvie had probably been
more than friends haunted Sylia, especially when she
considered her own relationship or lack thereof with
Priss.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nene nodded glumly, agreeing with Linna.

Looking over at Sylia, Linna smiled at her bravely as
she said, &#147;It&#39;ll take some time to get used to the
idea, but I think I&#39;ll manage.&#148;

Nene nodded her agreement, &#147;Yeah, it&#39;s actually kind
of cool!&#148;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Sylia rolled her eyes at that, getting
soft laughter from Linna and Nene. &#39;It feels good,&#39;
Sylia thought, &#39;not keeping that secret anymore.&#39; She
smiled at the two young women, and after a bit more
talk gently ushered them out.

Linna hesitated, &quot;If you need something, anything,
don&#39;t forget to call.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that,&quot; Sylia smiled as she went to shut the
door.

&quot;Give Priss some time,&quot; Nene said quietly before she
was off, &quot;she likes you too much to leave over
something like this.&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Sylia whispered, pressing her cheek to
the door once they were gone. &#39;Oh Priss,&#39; she thought
to herself sadly, feeling the first prickling of tears
at the corner of her eyes, &#39;I never wanted to tell you
this. I knew you couldn&#39;t handle it.&#39;

Wiping her eyes Sylia strode into her bedroom and
undressed, slipping into a silk robe before she headed
off to bed. She stopped for a moment by a tall mirror
and took a moment to look herself over. Her fingers
gently traced the network of nearly invisible scars,
as she let herself remember the weeks she had been
under the knife, trying to shape herself into a
warrior. She smiled wryly, thinking about Priss,
&#39;Instead, I found one.&#39; She tightened her robe, and
climbed into bed.</pre>
