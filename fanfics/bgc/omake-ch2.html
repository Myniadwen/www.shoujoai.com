<h1>Bubblegum Omake (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/omake-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;You do realize,&quot; Kuo said after a moment, &quot;that you&#39;re engaged?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; the green Knight Saber blinked as she dropped the Hou Bang 
leadership ring to the ground after she had slipped the engagement ring 
onto Reika Chang&#39;s finger.

&quot;That is an engagement ring,&quot; Kou said in his usual unflappable way, 
&quot;and Miss Chang doesn&#39;t seem to mind.&quot;

Reika nearly squealed as she threw her arms around the armored woman as 
she whispered, &quot;Oh Linna, I never realized you felt this way!&quot;

&quot;How did you guess I&#39;m Linna?&quot; the green Knight Saber murmured back, 
shocked.

&quot;I spent a while studying you as my captive,&quot; Reika whispered, &quot;you move 
with the same sexy grace.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Linna blushed. Awkwardly she continued, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean...&quot;

Kuo loomed suddenly, looking down at Linna dangerously. &quot;Are you saying 
you are dishonoring Reika?&quot; he demanded coldly.

&quot;No, no...&quot; Linna quickly backpedaled.

&quot;Linna,&quot; Reika looked up at her with suddenly tear filled eyes as she 
asked, &quot;does this mean you don&#39;t like me?&quot;

&quot;Of course I like you,&quot; Linna protested.

&quot;Oh that makes me so happy!&#39; Reika cried as she hugged Linna again.

&quot;Think she&#39;s in trouble?&quot; the blue Knight Saber mused, Priss sounding 
amused even through the suit&#39;s speakers.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Nene agreed, her hair blowing in the breeze, out of armor 
because she had arrived with the AD Police. She looked up at Priss 
thoughtfully, opened her mouth then closed it without saying anything.

&quot;What?&quot; Priss asked.

&quot;Why,&quot; Nene looked a little uncomfortable, &quot;haven&#39;t we been able to 
contact either you or Sylia the last few days?&quot;

Priss fidgeted, and Nene was pretty sure she was blushing even under her 
armor. &quot;We were,&quot; she hesitated, &quot;busy.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Nene smirked.

&quot;We were celebrating my getting the cast off,&quot; Priss snarled.

Nene looked amused, &quot;Yeah, I bet having two hands came in very handy.&quot;

&quot;Nene!&quot; Priss blurted.

&quot;Or is she not letting you use you hands?&quot; Nene wondered, &quot;Kinky.&quot;

Priss gave Nene a dangerous look, &quot;Get those perverted thoughts out of 
your head now, little lady.&quot;

&quot;Incoming,&quot; Nene warned.

&quot;Ah, Saber Blue,&quot; Sylia said as she blue and grey armor slinked up 
behind her, &quot;just wanted to remind you we&#39;re meeting later to... ah... 
debrief you on the situation.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Priss blushed.

Sylia let her hand linger on Priss&#39; very accurately sculpted back side 
as she cooed, &quot;See you there, lover.&quot;

Nene smirked as Sylia moved off to make an attempt to rescue Linna from 
the amorous Reika along with Kuo&#39;s planned shotgun wedding for the two 
of them. &quot;Not one word,&quot; Priss warned her flatly.

&quot;Aww,&quot; Nene pouted.

Leon McNichol sighed as he watched them interact, the brown haired 
officer lingering in hopes of free tickets to the Vision concert. &quot;I 
guess I don&#39;t have a chance with any of them anymore,&quot; the dark brown 
haired man said glumly.

His partner Dailey Wong looked up with a charming smile as the redhead 
let his hand rest on Leon&#39;s arm, &quot;You&#39;ll always have me.&quot;

&quot;Somehow, that doesn&#39;t help,&quot; Leon smiled wryly.

End

Notes: I always found it rather amusing that when Priss was hurt, Sylia 
took care of her at her home, rather than sending Priss to a hospital. 
One wonders what she did while poor Priss was weak and defenseless. lol 
It also struck me as amusing that Linna putting the ring on Reika could, 
maybe, be looked at as a proposal...</pre>
