------

Linna headed for the Silky Doll after work. She&#39;d moved into her 
fianc&eacute;&#39;s home roughly three weeks ago, and had yet to tell her parents 
about it. In fact, she had yet to tell her parents anything about her 
relationship with the owner of the Silky Doll and leader of the Knight 
Sabers. She wondered if it was best to continue to hide her 
relationship, or try to come out to her parents. After all, she was 
going to be marrying her in another two months; it wasn&#39;t like she could 
hide her relationship forever.

She entered the elevator and went down a few levels. Exiting, she headed 
for Sylia&#39;s bedroom. Across from the bed and against the far wall was an 
oak writing desk. It was a family heirloom, her love had explained. She 
sat down before it and pulled out some paper and a pen.

An hour later, the once empty small trash receptacle next to her was 
overflowing with crumpled sheets of paper as she sighed in frustration. 
Placing a fresh sheet in front of her, she began again...

---

Dear Mom and Dad,

You both may want to sit down for this. You see, I&#39;ve met someone here 
in Tokyo, and I&#39;ve fallen in love. We&#39;re engaged, in fact.

There&#39;s just one small thing. You see, she&#39;s a girl and...

---

She quickly crumpled the sheet as she allowed a groan to escape, unaware 
of the figure silently entering the room. As she was about to toss the 
letter into the trash with the others, she suddenly felt a familiar set 
of hands on her shoulders. She closed her eyes and smiled as Sylia began 
massaging the tension out of her neck and shoulders.

&quot;Mmm...&quot; she purred happily, &quot;Feels good...&quot;

&quot;Well, you looked like you could use it. Besides,&quot; Sylia added impishly, 
&quot;You look so adorable in your little office lady outfit.&quot;

Linna chuckled a bit at that as she relaxed under Sylia&#39;s hands. As the 
older woman continued to massage her, she noticed all the paper in the 
garbage, &quot;Having trouble with something, hon?&quot;

Linna nodded her head, &quot;I was trying to figure out how to tell my 
parents about you and us,&quot; she admitted, &quot;After that whole stupid 
incident with that gang last month, I don&#39;t want mom and dad finding out 
about us that way. I&#39;d rather it came from me, and...&quot;

&quot;And you can&#39;t figure out how to come out to them?&quot; Sylia asked as she 
once again eyed the crumpled balls of paper.

&quot;Basically, yeah,&quot; she sighed, &quot;I mean, they&#39;re kind of old-fashioned.&quot;

&quot;How old-fashioned?&quot;

&quot;My mom wears a kimono around the house pretty much all the time.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s pretty old-fashioned,&quot; Sylia agreed.

Linna laughed a bit at the remark before getting serious again, &quot;Sylia, 
I love you,&quot; she said tenderly as she placed her hand on Sylia&#39;s, &quot;I... 
I feel complete when I&#39;m with you, like there was a piece of me missing 
all these years that I was never even aware of until I met you. I&#39;m 
going to be sharing the rest of my life with you Sylia, and I just feel 
weird about not telling my folks. But every time I try to write them...&quot; 
her voice died out as the leader of the Knight Sabers bent over and 
lovingly wrapped her arms around her neck from behind.

&quot;Linna,&quot; Sylia said tenderly as she kissed her on the cheek, &quot;I love you 
too. And knowing how much I mean to you means more to me than you could 
possibly imagine. But maybe you need a bit of distance from this for a 
bit. Come on, you need to take a break.&quot;

&quot;But Sylia...&quot;

&quot;No buts young lady,&quot; Sylia quipped as she took Linna by the wrist and 
pulled her out of the seat. She then sat down in the still warm chair 
and pulled the younger woman back down onto her lap, wrapping her arms 
around her in a loving embrace. &quot;You need to get away from this for a 
while, and find something to take your mind off it,&quot; she added as she 
began to trace Linna&#39;s jaw line with her index finger.

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Linna asked seductively as she leaned towards Sylia, &quot;And 
exactly what kind of distraction would you have in mind?&quot;

Sylia answered her by bringing her lips to Linna&#39;s. The two women 
explored each other&#39;s mouths as their tongues danced around one another. 
Sylia reached up and unbuttoned Linna&#39;s collar. As she continued to 
unbutton her lover&#39;s blouse, both women could feel their body heat 
rising.

Linna pulled her lips away from Sylia&#39;s, &quot;Need a break my eye,&quot; she 
moaned with a smile, &quot;You just want my body,&quot; she joked as she reached 
down and undid the rest of her buttons, removing her blouse as she did 
so. She closed her eyes and inhaled a quick breath of air as Sylia 
reached over and ran her fingers lightly across her breasts, stopping to 
feel her now erect nipples through the fabric of her bra.

&quot;But of course, my dear,&quot; Sylia whispered as her lips brushed against 
the younger woman&#39;s. As they kissed again, Linna shifted herself so that 
she was now straddling the older woman&#39;s lap. She moaned as she felt 
Sylia reach behind and unhook her bra, pulling it aside as she began to 
fondle the younger Knight Saber&#39;s breasts.

Sylia separated her lips from Linna&#39;s as she took one of her love&#39;s 
almost painfully erect nipples into her mouth, Linna gasping as she felt 
her lover&#39;s tongue circle her areola. She put her hands behind her 
lover&#39;s head and arched her back, her fingers clutching onto silvery 
hair as she felt her turn her attention from one breast to the other.

Sylia brought her lips back to Linna&#39;s, the two holding one another as 
they kissed each other sensually. After several minutes, the older woman 
brought her lips away as she looked into Linna&#39;s beautiful blue eyes, 
cradling her cheeks in her hands.

&quot;The bed,&quot; she whispered huskily with desire in her eyes, &quot;Let&#39;s finish 
this in bed.&quot;

Linna raised an eyebrow, &quot;And here I thought you were the adventurous 
type,&quot; she said, kissing her quickly before getting up off her lap. She 
walked over to the large bed in the room and pulled off her skirt and 
panties as behind her she could hear Sylia&#39;s clothes fall to the floor. 
She turned around, her arousal rising even more than it already was upon 
seeing her lover&#39;s creamy-white skin, beautiful breasts and shaved sex. 
Her eyes rose from her body to the look of longing present in Sylia&#39;s 
face.

Sylia walked up to Linna, her grey eyes taking in the younger woman&#39;s 
form. She could remember the younger woman once confiding to her that 
she didn&#39;t know how a plain country girl such as herself could ever have 
won the heart of someone as beautiful as she was. As she looked at Linna 
and her earthy beauty, she smiled. &#39;If she could only see herself the 
way I see her,&#39; she mused, &#39;She would never have made such a ridiculous 
statement.&#39;

Sylia brought her lips back to Linna&#39;s, sucking on her lower lip as the 
younger woman sat back on the edge of the bed. Linna&#39;s jaw went slack as 
the older woman left a trail of kisses from her neck down her chest to 
her abdomen. She watched as Sylia knelt before her. She spread her legs 
for her as she put her hands behind her to support herself, her heart 
racing in anticipation.

Sylia brought two fingers up to Linna&#39;s cleft, her fingers gliding 
across the wet folds as Linna moaned softly. She moved her hand out of 
the way as she brought her mouth up, her tongue entering into and 
exploring her love&#39;s sex. Linna threw her head back and started 
breathing heavier as her lover held her hips. For her part, Sylia paid 
close attention to the younger woman&#39;s body language. She knew of no 
greater way to show her love to the brunette than to give her pleasure 
such as this, and she loved to watch her come as she made love to her.

Linna&#39;s back arched and her muscles began to tighten as she grunted out 
incoherent sounds, all the while Sylia continued to probe into her with 
her tongue, stroking, licking and sucking at her most sensitive areas. 
Finally, as her entire body spasmed in ecstasy she cried out Sylia&#39;s 
name, her strength giving way as she fell back onto the bed gasping for 
air.

Sylia lapped away at the last of the fluids before pulling back from her 
love&#39;s sex. She lay down on the bed next to Linna as she began to run 
her fingers through her brown hair.

&quot;So,&quot; she asked tenderly, &quot;Aren&#39;t you glad now that you took a break 
from writing that letter.&quot;

Linna opened her eyes and looked over at Sylia. She brought a hand up 
and stroked the older woman&#39;s cheek, &quot;I love you so much,&quot; she said 
sweetly before kissing her, tasting herself on Sylia&#39;s lips and tongue. 
She then lowered her hand and began to fondle the silver-haired woman&#39;s 
breast.

Sylia lay on her back as Linna now positioned herself on top of her, 
their lips still together. She began to slowly run her hand down her 
lover&#39;s side, feeling her squirm underneath her as she began running her 
hand up and down her bare thigh. She pulled her lips away, laying sweet 
kisses along her jaw line and down to the soft fleshy base of her neck.

Sylia moaned throatily as Linna brought her lips to the older woman&#39;s 
breast, gently raking her teeth across her erect nipples as she 
continued to stroke her thigh. She was so perfect; her skin almost 
reminded Linna of a china doll&#39;s, but unlike a doll&#39;s it wasn&#39;t cold and 
unfeeling. Her skin was warm and inviting, soft and tender to her touch. 
She began to suckle from her other nipple as she moved her hand, the 
woman underneath her allowing a gasp to escape as she cupped her mound 
with her fingers.

&quot;Linna...&quot; she whispered as the younger woman began to stroke her now 
wet labia. Linna brought her lips to Sylia&#39;s once again as she inserted 
first one, then two fingers into her, moving them in and out at a steady 
rhythm. The silver-haired beauty&#39;s hips began to thrust as a third 
finger was inserted, the two women&#39;s tongues rolling around each other 
faster as the older woman wrapped her leg around the brunette above her.

Linna felt a hand on the back of her head, pressing her mouth harder 
into Sylia&#39;s as she continued the steady rhythm, her lover rocking her 
hips as she impaled herself over and over again onto her slender 
fingers. Their tongues continued to swirl around one another as the 
younger woman could feel muscles slowly begin to tighten around her 
fingers.

Then, Sylia&#39;s tongue slowed down as she held desperately onto the back 
of Linna&#39;s head, her entire body stiffening as she came. After a few 
seconds, her hold relaxed as she sank back beneath the younger woman. 
Linna pulled her lips away as her lover continued to breathe heavily. 
She wrapped her arms around her as Sylia rested her head on her 
shoulder.

They lay together cuddling in the afterglow of their lovemaking for 
several minutes, neither wanting to disturb the sweet silence between 
them. Finally, Linna kissed Sylia softly on her forehead.

&quot;You&#39;re a wonderful distraction,&quot; she said affectionately.

Sylia smiled as she stroked her cheek with her hand, &quot;I try,&quot; she 
answered.

After a few more seconds of silence, Linna sighed, &quot;I still don&#39;t know 
what to tell my folks.&quot;

Sylia looked thoughtfully at her fianc&eacute;e, &quot;I know,&quot; she said 
sympathetically, &quot;But however you tell them, it&#39;s going to probably come 
as a bit of a shock. Hold on,&quot; she said as her eyes brightened a bit, &quot;I 
think I have an idea. For now, why not just tell them that you&#39;ve found 
happiness in Mega Tokyo, and leave it at that?&quot;

Linna thought about the suggestion, and smiled, &quot;I like that,&quot; she said.

Sylia smiled back, &quot;Good. And someday, when the time is right or you 
feel up to it, you can tell them more about me. Until then, don&#39;t try to 
force yourself to come out to them.&quot;

Linna closed her eyes as Sylia began running her hand up and down her 
arm, &quot;I suppose you&#39;re right,&quot; she said, &quot;I just don&#39;t want you to think 
I&#39;m embarrassed or ashamed of you.&quot;

Sylia lifted her head from Linna&#39;s shoulder as she gazed into her deep 
blue eyes, &quot;I could never think that,&quot; she said affectionately, giving 
the brunette a quick peck on the lips before laying her head back down. 
They lay in each other&#39;s arms silently for several more minutes before 
the sound of a stomach growling interrupted the warm scene. The older 
woman looked at Linna, a bemused expression on her face, &quot;Let me guess,&quot; 
she said, &quot;You forgot to grab dinner, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

Linna looked back at Sylia, and both women began to laugh.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Sylia said, &quot;You can finish writing your parents later. Right 
now let&#39;s get dressed and see what we can come up with in the kitchen.&quot;

&quot;Sounds fine by me,&quot; Linna answered, still laughing softly as she and 
Sylia got out of bed. A few minutes later, both women headed for the 
kitchen.

-End-

Notes: After last chapter, I wanted to do something a bit lighter and 
more romantic. Hope you all enjoyed it.</pre>
