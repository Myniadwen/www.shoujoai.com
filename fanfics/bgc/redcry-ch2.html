<h1>Red Eyes, Crying Eyes (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/redcry-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Linna snuggled down into the comfort of the bed, feeling the lovely 
sensation of the silk sheets rubbing her body as she turned over in 
her sleepy state. &#39;Since when do I have silk sheets?&#39; Linna soon found 
herself wondering. She opened her eyes a bit and peered around a large 
bedroom that, of course, she didn&#39;t recognize at all.

&#39;Oh, hell,&#39; Linna thought to herself wearily. She looked over and saw 
that the other side of the queen sized bed had a indentation showing 
it also had been slept in. With a frown she began to rack her brain, 
wondering which bar she had been drinking at the night before and who 
might have been there buying her drinks.

Linna sat up in the bed, and noticed she was mostly naked, except for 
wearing a very sheer, light green nightie that she didn&#39;t recognize as 
being one of her own. As she prepared to get out of bed she was struck 
by the memory of the battle the night before, then, the whole 
evening&#39;s events came rushing back to her, including her very 
embarrassing collapse, later.

She blushed, but relaxed a bit, thinking &#39;Guess I must be somewhere in 
the Silky Doll, then.&#39; She looked around the bare room and wondered 
who&#39;s bedroom she was laying in. There wasn&#39;t anything to indicate the 
gender of the room&#39;s resident, and her eyes widened as she came to the 
obvious conclusion.

&quot;Mackie, you little pervert,&quot; Linna suddenly angrily growled under her 
breath as she sat straight up in bed. She quickly looked around the 
room to see where her clothes might be laying around. The thought of 
him gleefully stripping her naked and then putting her to bed, death 
would be far, far too good for him!

&quot;I heard that,&quot; a very amused female voice said. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, your 
virtue&#39;s safe from him, at least,&quot; she continued, and Linna turned to 
see a broadly smiling Sylia walk in, carrying a food laden tray. She 
walked gracefully over to the bedside, the gossamer thin gown flowing 
around her, not really concealing the fact she was just wearing 
panties and bra underneath it.

&quot;This is your room?&quot; Linna asked, sounding a little surprised. Of 
course, she had never actually seen the inside of Sylia&#39;s bedroom, but 
it wasn&#39;t what she had been expecting at all. She had thought Sylia 
would have gone for something a little more decadent, honestly, not 
this very spartan design. A unadorned desk, the bed, a small chair, a 
few bookcases and a closet were all that occupied the small room.

&quot;I though about putting you out on the couch, but with Mackie 
here....&quot; Sylia just shrugged expressively, and grinned impishly down 
at Linna. Linna smiled back at her knowingly, and they both broke out 
laughing.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Linna said, and suddenly felt a bit uncomfortable. &quot;Uhm, 
were are my clothes?&quot; Linna asked a smirking Sylia a bit desperately.

Sylia sat on the bed beside Linna, offering the food tray. &quot;I&#39;ll give 
them back after you eat,&quot; Sylia said firmly. &quot;Can&#39;t have guests 
fainting from hunger.&quot;

Linna sighed softly, as she remembered asgain her fainting spell last 
night. &#39;I wonder how long it&#39;ll take for me to live that one down?&#39; 
she mused. She looked down at the eggs, bacon, toast and orange juice, 
all nicely arranged on the plate and, after she tried a bite, fairly 
well prepared. Sylia stretched out beside her and began to eat her own 
food neatly as Linna asked her between mouthfuls, &quot;I didn&#39;t know you 
could cook.&quot;

Sylia chuckles and points a finger at the plates, &quot;This isn&#39;t all that 
terribly difficult.&quot; She had a little sip of her juice, &quot;I hope you 
don&#39;t mind that I stayed here with you last night. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re 
perceptive enough to know my sexuality, but I can assure you nothing 
untoward happened here last night...&quot; she said it all totally deadpan, 
but as she finished the last part, a bit of red colored her cheeks. 
She looked down at her plate, unable to look at Linna.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you were a perfect gentleman,&quot; Linna reassured her, and 
smiled shyly over at the faintly blushing Sylia. She grinned suddenly 
and chuckled as she added, &quot;Nene still hasn&#39;t figured it out, by the 
way.&quot;

Sylia looked over at her in surprise, a nearly eaten piece of toast 
hanging halfway in, and halfway out of her mouth. She chewed it up and 
swallowed, then she said crossly &quot;What do I have to do, wear a pink 
triangle on my forehead?&quot;

The bedroom door opened a bit and Mackie stuck his head in the room to 
ask, &quot;Sylia, the load of wash is dry. Where do you want me to put it?&quot;

His eyes grew wide as he saw Linna and Sylia lying on the bed in their 
nightgowns, eating their breakfast together so decadently and he 
instantly jumped to the totally wrong conclusion. His face turned beet 
red, a bit of blood tricked from his nose, and he fled, slamming the 
door shut behind him with undue haste.

Linna and Sylia just sat there a moment in surprise, then they both 
shared a good long laugh over that. They finished up breakfast talking 
comfortably, and Linna realized Sylia had spoken more to her in the 
last few days than she had in all the years she had known her.

&quot;I&#39;ll go get your clothes from Mackie,&quot; Sylia said smiling.

&quot;You let him wash my stuff?&quot; Linna said to her a bit dubiously.

Sylia grinned and laughed, &quot;Let the poor boy have a thrill.&quot; She 
looked Linna up and down and added, &quot;You can keep the nightie if you 
want.&quot; She blushed a bit, &quot;It looks good on you.&quot; With that, Sylia, 
too, all but fled.

Linna watched her go, thoughtfully. Once she was dressed, she folded 
the green nightgown and carried it under her arm when she was met by 
Sylia at the door. &quot;Thanks for taking such good care of me,&quot; Linna 
said, and felt strangely shy.

&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; Sylia answered. &quot;Would you like to have dinner 
with me tonight?&quot; she suddenly blurted out.

Linna smiled, glad that Sylia had asked. &quot;Yes, please,&quot; she said 
happily. &quot;Is seven o&#39;clock all right with you?&quot; Linna asked her.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Sylia said with a smile. &quot;I&#39;ll see you at the Rose, at seven. 
It&#39;s a date, then,&quot; she said, and blushed as she realized what she had 
just said.

Linna didn&#39;t correct her, just smiled and said &quot;I&#39;ll see you then.&quot;



Sylia stood in the shadows of the club, watching the woman in the 
blond wig loudly sing to the cheering crowd. She really didn&#39;t want to 
be here right now, but in some way she felt she had to. She owed Priss 
some explaination, and maybe this way Sylia could get some closure.

Priss had taken the blond wig off and was toweling the sweat from her 
neck as Sylia walked into the disaster area of Priss&#39; dressing room. 
She looked sourly over at Sylia, and Sylia found herself wondering how 
she ever could have felt any attraction to such a total mess. &quot;What do 
you want?&quot; Priss asked her sullenly.

&quot;To apologize,&quot; Sylia said to her calmly, crossing her arms in front 
of her in a reflexive move to self protection.

Priss looked a little surprised as she answered, &quot;For what? I know 
you&#39;ve been a grouch lately, but that&#39;s no reason to apologize.&quot;

Sylia looked over at Priss, and suddenly understood that the self 
centered rocker had simply not seen Sylia&#39;s state of distress over the 
past few weeks. Hadn&#39;t seen,. or she just hadn&#39;t cared. &quot;I wanted to 
apologize, because I hired a private investigator to check on Sylvie,&quot; 
she said softly. &quot;He inadvertantly took some photos of the two of you 
together.&quot;

Priss just shrugged a bit at the mention of Sylvie. Then again, she 
hadn&#39;t talked about poor Anri&#39;s death with anyone, either. &quot;What did 
you do with them?&quot; Priss asked. She saw the blank look and elaborated, 
&quot;The photos?&quot;

&quot;I immediately destroyed both the photos and the negatives,&quot; Sylia 
said to her calmly. &quot;I don&#39;t intend to hire that investigator again.&quot;

She looked at this cool, detached woman, trying to see any sign of 
actual feeling and realized that except for her famous battle fury, 
Priss was almost dead inside. She just didn&#39;t seem to care. Sylia 
shivered a bit as Priss answered her, &quot;That&#39;s all right, then.&quot; Her 
tone of voice was so cold! &quot;Thanks for telling me,&quot; Priss finally said 
to Sylia as she picked up her duffel bag from the messy floor and 
prepared to go.

Sylia watched her close the door behind her and felt as if a cloud had 
suddenly shifted, releasing the warmth of the sun&#39;s rays. She knew, 
now, that whatever she might have once felt for Priss Asagiri, it was 
in no way love.



They were meeting for dinner again that evening, it was going to be 
their first &#39;planned&#39; meal together, unlike their first few chance 
meetings. Linna had spent more than a few minutes looking through her 
closet searching for just the right thing to wear. There had been 
something in Sylia&#39;s eyes when she extended the invitation that made 
Linna wonder if this might be a real date, not just a dinner between 
friends.

&#39;But do I want it to be a real date?&#39; she mused, holding a dress up to 
her body as she gazed into the bedroom mirror. &#39;I&#39;ve never been 
particularly interested in girls before,&#39; she thought, &#39;so why this 
sudden attraction to Sylia?&#39;

And it was an real attraction, Linna realized. Even during that teary 
eyed dinner last week, Linna had felt drawn to Sylia, to the 
shockingly rare vulnerability shown by the normally iron willed leader 
of the Knight Sabers. And this morning, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen 
the joking, blushing Sylia before. &#39;I even think she was flirting with 
me a little bit!&#39; Linna thought with a grin. &#39;Does she really trust me 
so much,&#39; Linna wondered, &#39;to show me these other sides to her, or is 
it just because of whatever hurt her?&#39;

&quot;Or whom ever,&quot; Linna suddenly said aloud. She frowned, Sylia&#39;s bad 
temper really dated back to when Priss... &quot;Met Sylvie,&quot; she finished 
quietly. Had Sylia been in love with Priss all this time? It would 
certainly explain a lot.

Linna shook her head, trying to dispell those thoughts. She looked up 
at the clock, and froze, thinking &#39;If I don&#39;t hurry, I&#39;ll be late!&#39; 
She finally settled for a nice party dress, not too revealing, and 
some strange impulse made her pick her green one. Obviously, Sylia 
must like seeing her in that color, considering it was also the color 
of Linna&#39;s hardsuit. &#39;And,&#39; she thought with a little blush, &#39;it was 
the color of that nightie she put me in.&#39; </pre>
