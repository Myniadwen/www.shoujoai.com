<h1>Moments in Time (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/momentime-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Sara Asagiri-Stingray looked around her carefully and
then the silver haired young woman crept along the
hall of the complex that was hidden by the facade of
the Silky Doll lingerie shop. She paused at the
intersection then hurried along, counting down under
her breath before bolting to a door down the hall.
Slapping her hand on the switch it opened with a soft
hiss and she raced inside.

&quot;Hopefully I dodged Sylia-momma&#39;s security scans,&quot;
Sara murmured to herself as she walked over to the
computer console, &quot;or I&#39;m going to be in real trouble
later.&quot; A wry smile, &quot;Though if I&#39;m right, I&#39;m in
trouble already.&quot;

As her fingers flew over the keyboard Sara thought
about the series of events that had brought her here
to this place and her plan to raid her parent&#39;s data
base. It had begun with her increasing awareness of
her own seclusion here, the lack of contact with
anyone other than her parents or their friends. She
had asked why, of course, but was only given vague
answers that inflamed her curiosity more.

Watching various entertainment vids ended up being her
next clue. Sara hadn&#39;t realized that her accelerated
aging was abnormal until she saw several science
programs, then used the educational software her
mother Sylia had provided to learn more. Aging to a
physical age of 18 within four years was impossible
for a human, she discovered, and that her appearance
was outside the normal range of human variation.

Sara was determined to learn even more, but several
lock-outs installed on her personal computer blocked
her despite her best efforts. Asking Priss-poppa about
it seemed pointless too, it was likely her parents and
their friends were all involved in keeping something
from her. She had also become more aware of the level
of surveillance in their home, and suspected her
parents of spying on her. So, studying the security
and what she could observe of her extended family&#39;s
activities, she devised a plan.

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Sara murmured as the files began to come
up.

Clicking on Sara Asagiri-Stingray brought up a series
of sub-files, including medical data, a journal by
Sylia and other things. Opening the medical file Sara
skimmed the facts, swiftly digesting that she was a
hybrid of two humans and a boomer. She hesitated over
the journal, then clicked on a random entry.

&quot;Journal 12,&quot; Sylia Stingray was sitting at her desk,
her clothes a bit messy and looking visibly tired.
&quot;Sara took her very first steps today. Priss was ready
to jump in to help out but our little girl managed it
just fine, going from me to her with barely a
stumble.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;It&#39;s only been a few
weeks from her birth and Sara is already
developmentally a year old... but I worry that her
accelerated aging could be harmful.&quot; There was a sound
of a child crying and she winced, &quot;More later.&quot;

&quot;Well, that was interesting,&quot; Sara blinked. She had
been worried that her mother really was some kind of
mad scientist, but instead she sounded like a doting
parent. It was all kind of comforting, really.

&quot;Journal 22,&quot; Sylia Stingray looked pleasantly tired,
&quot;we let the other Knight Sabers know about Sara...&quot;

&quot;Knight Sabers?!&quot; Sara stopped the recording a moment,
her eyes widening as she swiftly put the pieces
together. Her mother, Priss, their friends... they
were the Knight Sabers. It all fit, and she felt a
thrill of excitement knowing she was related to two of
them.

&quot;...the reactions were understandably mixed,&quot; Sylia
finished as Sara continued playing the recording.
&quot;Linna and Nene were both rather annoyed that I kept
Sara&#39;s existence a secret, not to mention being
worried that she might be a revival of Galatea, but I
think we calmed their fears,&quot; Sylia explained.

Sara left the file, then looked up Galatea in her
mother&#39;s files. &quot;Her sister?&quot; she murmured as she
read, &quot;The first boomer...&quot;

&quot;Journal 33,&quot; Priss Asagiri looked extremely pained,
her spiky brown hair falling in her eyes, &quot;I swear I&#39;m
going to kill that kid.&quot;

&quot;Priss!&quot; Sylia scolded as she appeared on the screen,
&quot;it&#39;s not her fault that she walked in on us and
Nigel.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never been so embarrassed in my life,&quot; Priss
groaned, running a hand through her short, spikey
hair.

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Nigel grunted.

Sara giggled, sitting in the computer chair. It HAD
been pretty funny, her stumbling in through the
unlocked door, Priss, Sylia and Nigel in a tangled
mass on the bed all looking at her with eyes large as
plates. Then they had madly scrambled for blankets and
clothes while Sylia tried to hustle Sara out of there.

&quot;Journal 40,&quot; Sylia smiled, &quot;I&#39;ve brought the new
boomer-hardsuits online, and as an unexpected side
effect Sara&#39;s gotten some new playmates. Minerva,
Silvie, Athena and Nike have developed a strong bond
with the child, and she seems to enjoy having them
around. I find myself with mixed feelings, however.
I&#39;m wondering, has Sara bonded with them because of
her basically friendly nature, or does this have to do
with some latent boomer trait?&quot;

&quot;You and me both,&quot; Sara admitted.

&quot;Journal 44,&quot; Nigel had a unlit cigarette dangling
from his mouth. &quot;I think Sara makes a better assistant
than Mackie did,&quot; he shrugged then signed off.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Sara murmured, noting that the last
Journal link was just a few days ago.

&quot;Journal 50,&quot; Sylia said, looking at the camera,
&quot;Sara&#39;s reached the physical age of seventeen. Her
rate of aging has slowed to near normal, and I think
her mental development is equal to that...&quot;

Sara smirked, &quot;If not better.&quot;

&quot;...if not better,&quot; Sylia finished. &quot;She&#39;s remarkably
perceptive and precocious, with a intuitive grasp of
people and their inner workings. Sara also seems to be
more and more self-aware, of both her situation and
her unusual nature. I&#39;ve resolved to reveal some of
her origins, as soon as I can determine the best way
broach the subject.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be...&quot; Sara murmured, tilting her silvery haired
head to the side.

&quot;Continuing with the theme of difficult discussions,&quot;
Sylia looked amused, &quot;Nigel, Priss and I are debating
on who gets to give the birds and the bees talk to
Sara, as well as how much detail we should go into.&quot;
She looked pained, &quot;For such seemingly tough people
Nigel and Priss are being remarkably chicken.&quot;

Grinning, Sara had to fight back a laugh at that. In
fact Priss HAD tried to explain sex to her a few days
ago, in a extremely embarrassed way. &quot;You see, when a
man and a woman love each other,&quot; Priss said
uncomfortably, &quot;they sometimes want to...&quot;

&quot;Have sex,&quot; Sara had nodded politely. &quot;Oral,
missionary or something more exotic?&quot; she asked
curiously.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Priss had looked at her in shock.

Sara shrugged as she explained, &quot;Nigel doesn&#39;t change
the access code often enough for the adult filter on
the entertainment system.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;ve been watching...?&quot; Priss asked weakly.

&quot;There was one called Susie&#39;s Sex Show that I found
pretty informative,&quot; Sara admitted, &quot;and the late
night movies were entertaining.&quot; She looked up at
Priss curiously and asked, &quot;Did I do something wrong?&quot;

&quot;No, not really,&quot; Priss sighed. &quot;Any questions?&quot; she
asked wryly.

&quot;I think I have a pretty good grasp of the basics,&quot;
Sara said agreeably, &quot;but if I have a problem, I&#39;ll
ask.&quot;

&quot;Remember,&quot; Priss said to her with a unusual degree of
gentleness, &quot;if you need anything, ask me, Sylia or
Nigel.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Sara promised.

&quot;Now,&quot; Priss said, &quot;there&#39;s something else I have to
take care of.&quot; Striding out of her daughter&#39;s bedroom
Priss roared out, &quot;Nigel! Do you have any idea what
you&#39;ve been exposing our little girl to?!&quot;

&quot;Poor Nigel,&quot; Sara murmured, sitting there in the
computer room and remembering the lecture he had
gotten.

Quickly making a decision Sara logged out of the
computer, closing up the files as well as erasing all
traces she had been there. Checking her watch and
carefully timing her movements she retraced her steps
out of Sylia&#39;s secured wing of the Knight Saber&#39;s
headquarters, reaching her bedroom in time to grab a
few hours of sleep.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Sara said sleepily as she entered the
kitchen, the sound of breakfast cooking and the usual
morning scents greeting her.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Henderson nodded, the old English
butler settling the small table.

At the stove Athena efficiently cooked the eggs while
keeping a eye on the bacon, the boomer giving Sara a
pleasant smile. Both Priss and Sylia were at the table
in their usual robes, sleepily drinking from cups of
coffee.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Sara said, giving both of her parents a
kiss on the cheek.

&quot;Yo,&quot; Priss flashed a sleepy smile.

Sylia covered her mouth to hide a yawn as she said,
&quot;Morning.&quot;

&quot;Is Nigel still in exile?&quot; Sara asked curiously as she
sat down.

Priss laughed, &quot;No, he&#39;s good. He&#39;s just working on
rebuilding some bikes for his shop.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Sara said, feeling some relief as she
quietly added, &quot;I&#39;d hate to think I got him into real
trouble.&quot;

&quot;Here you go,&quot; Henderson said as he and Athena
delivered steaming plates of food.

Sylia hesitated, then pushed her plate aside. &quot;Sara,
there&#39;s some things I&#39;ve been meaning to tell you...&quot;
she said seriously.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Sara smiled inside, feeling fairly certain she
knew what was coming.</pre>
