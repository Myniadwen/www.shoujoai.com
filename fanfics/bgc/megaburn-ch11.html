<h1>Megatokyo Burning (part 11 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/megaburn-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Officer Nene Romanova put the phone down, the blonde
haired officer&#39;s face grave. &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Lisa Valente
asked, the dusky skinned younger woman looking at the
lieutenant worriedly.

&quot;Keiko never woke up,&quot; Nene said softly, &quot;the case is
being upgraded to murder.&quot;

Leon McNicol entered the office, the tall brown haired
chief of AD Police looking at her with concern. &quot;So
what&#39;s going on?&quot; he asked, &quot;I recalled all our
officers like you asked, but there had better be a
good reason.&quot;

&quot;How does armed insurrection sound?&quot; Nene asked
tiredly. She looked over at Lisa, &quot;Have the crackers
determined if the disk is legit?&quot;

Lisa nodded grimly, &quot;It looks like Bioware, Re-genex
and Nergal, along with several other corps, have been
planning some kind of move to take over the city by
force.&quot;

&quot;But why did Re-genex get hit by the others?&quot; Leon
asked crossly.

&quot;Maybe they were getting greedy,&quot; Nene mused, &quot;or
maybe some of the others wanted a bigger share of the
pie.&quot;

Leon drummed his fingers on the desk, his look
thoughtful. &quot;Daley&#39;s still up north, trying to
negotiate with China over the extradition of that
group of corporate hackers,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll try to get
him back here, too.&quot;

&quot;Maybe not,&quot; Nene offered quietly. At Leon&#39;s
questioning look she continued, &quot;We don&#39;t know how bad
and crazy this is all going to get, it might be better
to keep him out of the city.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t think...?&quot; Lisa looked at her in shock.

&quot;Figuring for a worst case scenario,&quot; Leon nodded, &quot;it
makes sense.&quot; He looked over at Nene, &quot;I guess we
didn&#39;t get that disk legally?&quot;

&quot;No, but I&#39;d try to arrest them anyway,&quot; Nene answered
him grimly, &quot;but before we send anyone out we need to
have them ready with K-suits and chopper backup. The
companies in question have been hiring mercenaries and
smuggling in armored suits and I have no idea if
they&#39;d risk using them against us.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s do it.&quot; Leon strode towards the door
before stopping to ask, &quot;You want to lead one of the
teams in, too?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to but I&#39;d better,&quot; Nene responded. Once
he and Lisa both left Nene sat at her desk and
activated her communicator, dialing out on a secure
line, &quot;Sylia?&quot;

The silver haired woman looked grim, and behind her
there were enough details visible to indicate that
Sylia was at Arisugawa&#39;s Locket. &quot;We&#39;re getting
organized here,&quot; she said crisply, &quot;what can we do to
assist the AD Police?&quot;

Nene smiled, thinking of how odd their positions were,
now. Once it would have been Sylia giving out orders,
Nene and the other Knight Sabers racing to obey, but
now she was giving the commands. &quot;Mostly I&#39;d just like
the Knight Sabers and others out on the streets,&quot; she
said, &quot;we&#39;re trying to snip this in the bud by moving
on the companies now.&quot;

&quot;Mackie and Skuld are bringing out the Mobile Pit Van
now,&quot; Sylia revealed, &quot;we&#39;ll be ready to go when
needed.&quot;

&quot;And Arisugawa and her friends?&quot; Nene asked curiously.

&quot;Juri and her staff are determined to get involved,&quot;
Sylia conceded, &quot;they&#39;ll be moving out along with the
Sailor Senshi and the Duelists.&quot;

&quot;Going to be one hell of a group.&quot; Nene murmured
before smiling wryly, &quot;let&#39;s just hope we don&#39;t need
them.&quot; All business she continued, &quot;Got to go, but
I&#39;ll contact you later.&quot;

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Sylia said before signing off.

A few minutes later Nene had changed to tactical gear
and was running into the vehicle bays, meeting her
team at two of the transport carriers. Each could haul
two of the K-suit armors as well as five troops,
hopefully enough to deal with whatever was coming.

&quot;Lisa?&quot; Nene blinked, recognizing her assistant
sitting in the drivers seat.

&quot;Someone&#39;s got to be along to keep you out of
trouble,&quot; Lisa answered, the young woman dressed in
the same kind of light armor that Nene was wearing.

Nene opened her mouth, then closed it on seeing the
determined looks on the other woman&#39;s face. Instead
she turned to the troopers, &quot;We&#39;re headed out to
Bioware, officially to execute a warrant to search the
place, but in reality we&#39;re going out there to secure
the premises and try to put their bosses in protective
custody.&quot;

&quot;So why K-suits?&quot; one officer piped up.

&quot;You all got the briefing on the smuggling of Armored
Suits a few days ago?&quot; Nene smiled grimly. She took a
breath, &quot;Some of the companies we&#39;re going after today
may be involved.&quot;

&quot;Oh this is going to be fun,&quot; a younger officer
murmured, a slight smile teasing at his lips.

Nene decided not to comment on that.

A few moments later all of the transport carriers
peeled out from the garage beneath the AD Police
headquarters, even as choppers took off from the roof
to spread out in all directions over the city. Lisa
used the radios to call Nene in the lead truck as they
hurried out to Bioware, &quot;So why call it protective
custody?&quot;

&quot;Keiko had friends,&quot; Nene answered semi-seriously as
the city lights streamed by her window, &quot;some of whom
are very annoyed with the company. If they get their
hands on the heads of Bioware before we do, they&#39;re in
deep shit.&quot;

&quot;Not to mention the Sailor Senshi are involved,&quot; Lisa
said, a bit of awe in her voice.

Nene felt herself smile as she said teasingly, &quot;Aren&#39;t
they just urban legends?&quot;

&quot;I did say that once, didn&#39;t I?&quot; Lisa admitted as they
reached a familiar looking business district. The
Bioware tower wasn&#39;t that far from Re-genex, a modern
skyscraper surrounded by similar buildings, various
corporate vans and transports around it.

&quot;Get the K-suits ready,&quot; Nene said once they pulled up
in front of the building, &quot;everyone, have your weapons
ready. We don&#39;t know what we&#39;re going to be dealing
with.&quot;

Her troopers quickly readied themselves, guns armed
and ready even as the K-suits in the back of the
trucks were activated. The sides of the truck folded
down and a ramp extended, allowing the bulky suits of
personal armor to move out.

&#39;Not anywhere near the capabilities of the Knight
Sabers hardsuits,&quot; Nene thought as the heavy armors
moved, &#39;but at least they&#39;re now about the same level
as military suits.&#39;

&quot;Deployed and ready to go,&quot; Lisa reported with a
salute.

&quot;Then let&#39;s get moving...,&quot; Nene started to say before
something caught her eye. The Delivery trucks around
the buildings were suddenly moving, and there were
people climbing in the back of some of the ones that
were parked.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Lisa asked even as the back doors of a
nearby truck popped open, revealing a massive shape
resting inside.

&quot;GET DOWN!&quot;

Exploding from the backs of several transport trucks
military armored suits raced forward, mini-missiles
launching from the shoulder mounts even as they
brought their weapons to bear. Nene found herself
grabbing Lisa as they dove for cover, other officers
following even as the K-suits moved to intercept the
attackers.

&quot;How the hell?&quot; Lisa squeaked out.

&quot;They knew we were coming,&quot; Nene snarled out even as
her troopers began to return fire, crouching behind
exploded vehicles to fire at mercenary soldiers
advancing behind the armored suits. The only good news
was that they were holding their own, the AD Police
Hardsuits dodging long range attacks to get into hand
to hand with their mercenary counterparts.

Within the building a young woman gazed out at the
conflict with expressionless red eyes, her blue hair
falling gently around her face. &quot;The penny&#39;s dropped,&quot;
the harried looking executive behind her barked into
his phone, &quot;the AD Police are on to us!&quot;

&quot;Are you certain?&quot;

&quot;The AD Police attacked us,&quot; he answered, &quot;the
mercenaries are engaging them now.&quot;

&quot;Get Ayanami-prime to safety,&quot; the voice ordered, &quot;it
isn&#39;t time to mobilize her just yet. Besides, we have
something better to occupy the AD Police...&quot;</pre>
