<h1>Love</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saberprime.html">Saber Prime</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	I had long been entrusting my life to Sylia. It was only 
natural; she was the leader, after all. All my hopes and dreams rested 
in her achieving victory. If she did not, and we failed, I could not 
continue as I was. It was just that way between all of us. We had a 
silent agreement all around: If Sylia failed, we all failed. The team was 
set on this rule. It was the one understanding we all shared. She was 
the bond that held us together, the essence of the team, and the center 
of our worlds.
	I never truly realized any of this until I saw her lying there in 
a pool of her own blood. Her eyes were not glassy or sullen as anyone 
else&#39;s would have been. She was not afraid. Hardly moving at all, 
without raspy breaths or desperate pleas. I knelt down beside her, 
cradling her in my arms and begging her not to die. She did not give 
me a reassuring smile or utter any condolences on her own death. She 
simply stared at me, watching me as I tearfully demanded that she 
restore herself.
	I told her I loved her.
	She died.
	A part of me died with her.
