<pre>	&quot;Shit!&quot;
	Priss felt the impact before it had even come. The arms of the Boomer 
slammed into her stomach, knocking her backward into a pile of rubble. Her 
vision was instantly blurred as her head collided with the cinder blocks behind 
her. She let out a sharp yelp, hardly able to stay conscious. The growling 
laughter of the Boomer told her that she was in danger, yet she had not been 
able to get over the shock of the flight and its excruciating landing. Priss 
watched as the Boomer readied itself to charge her. It began its run like a bull 
as a matador. Priss shut her eyes, horrified.
	The sound of metal clashing with metal startled her. Her eyes flew 
open in time to see Linna had rammed the Boomer with her body, adjusting its 
path enough that the Boomer stumbled and fell to the ground. In an instant 
Sylia was atop the monstrosity, her Knuckle Bomber crushing its head 
immediately. She delivered a shot from her beam cannon into the open cavity 
and darted away as the machine exploded. Sylia landed quietly several meters 
back, examining the damage she had done. 
	&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Priss asked the now fallen Linna. Linna nodded, 
though her movements were weak. Priss could sense a reassuring smile on 
Linna&#39;s face despite the Hardsuit helmets blocking her view. Sylia approached 
them both.
	&quot;It isn&#39;t like you to fail like this, Priss,&quot; she stated matter-of-factly. 
&quot;I&#39;m disappointed.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s not her fault,&quot; Linna quickly intervened. &quot;I was supposed to be 
backing her up but I got sidetracked. It won&#39;t happen again, Sylia. I promise.&quot;
	&quot;I see...&quot; Sylia looked at the two of them as Linna limped toward Priss. 
Her armor, the lightest of the four Hardsuit, had been cracked on the breast 
plates and up and down the sides. Her pain was evident, but when she opened 
her visor Priss could see that she really *was* smiling.
	&quot;Quite a fight, huh?&quot; she said as she bent over to help Priss from the 
ground. Priss slung her arm over Linna&#39;s shoulder, leaning against her 
comrade. 
	&quot;Yeah.&quot; She looked at Sylia, whose back was turned to them. &quot;Thanks 
for covering for me, Linna. You didn&#39;t need to do that. Sylia may be angry at 
both of us now.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s nothing. Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Linna helped her toward the 
group&#39;s big rig as they departed from the site.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Linna flinched as Sylia pulled the wraps tight around her ribs. She had 
never broken her ribs before, although Priss had more than a few times. The 
strength behind Sylia&#39;s grip was also not helping her pain. She noticed that no 
matter how often she squawked her complained, Sylia paid her voice no heed. 
She was a skilled doctor, Linna decided. That was enough. Asking Sylia to be 
compassionate was going too far.
	&quot;Thanks,&quot; Linna said as Sylia finished the job. Sylia grabbed the rest 
of the bandages. 
	&quot;If you had agreed with Priss to cover her, I would have liked to know 
about it.&quot; Sylia eyed her, waiting for Linna&#39;s response. 
	Linna could think of nothing to say. Sylia obviously knew that she had 
lied. She and Priss had not communicated at all once they had been called for 
the job. There had been a little tension between them since Priss had battled 
Largo a month before. Linna had commented that Priss would not have had all 
those wounds had she not been so upset over Sylvie&#39;s death. The reaction had 
been violence at first, forcing Sylia and Mackie to physically restrain her until 
she calmed down. From that point on it had been not unlike the &quot;silent 
treatment&quot; that children gave to one another. Linna felt awkward around Priss 
from that point on. Sylia recognized this, as she did any change that took place. 
Linna rushing to Priss&#39; defense and then lying about it was another thing Linna 
knew Sylia would note.
	&quot;Tell me about your plans next time,&quot; Sylia stated. &quot;I could have done 
a cleaner job of disarming the Boomer and have had fewer repairs to do now 
had you not broken in like that. It was risky. Your neck could have been 
snapped at that angle.&quot;
	&quot;I know.&quot; Linna made herself smile. &quot;But we won, didn&#39;t we?&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s not worth the loss of a Hardsuit.&quot;
	Linna was taken aback. &#39;...the loss of a *Hardsuit*&#39; rather than the loss 
of a human life? She started to respond but cut herself off. Sylia had never 
really understood human life, she realized with less surprise than she had 
anticipated for such ideas. Sylia just was not interested in people. She hadn&#39;t 
been when Priss had had to kill Sylvie. There had been no confrontations 
between the two about it, but Linna knew that they were both harboring anger 
or irritation with one another. Priss was angry that Sylia was so heartless. Sylia 
was angry that Priss was not.
	Without another word, Linna stood from the bed where Sylia usually 
kept her &#39;patients,&#39; as she called them. Priss had frequented that bed during her 
time as a Knight Saber. At least once a month she had to spend a night there 
overcoming one wound or another. Occasionally she was hooked up to 
equipment or shot full of morphine, something which never ceased to bother 
Linna. She didn&#39;t want to think that Sylia would insert any kind of needle into 
her body, let alone one with an addictive substance like that.
	Another realization came to Linna: She did not trust Sylia. It was 
something she had never considered before. Sylia was her leader and to that 
end she entrusted her life to her regularly. Yet beyond their field work, she 
found Sylia a little disturbing, as did Priss. Nene idolized Sylia in every way. 
Most things Linna felt were mutual feelings with Priss, she thought as she 
grabbed her coat.
	&quot;I&#39;m leaving,&quot; she called to Sylia. Sylia called out a brief farewell 
before returning to her work. Linna shrugged, exiting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	It was several hours later when Linna returned. She had forgotten her 
wallet. Her haste it must have fallen out of the coat, she decided. She wandered 
into the building, typing in Sylia&#39;s newest codes for entrance. Sylia changed the 
codes so often that Linna often found herself writing in the wrong one. This 
was one of those times.
	&quot;Damn!&quot; She narrowed her eyes, trying another one. It still did not 
work.
	&quot;Need help?&quot;
	Linna spun around. Priss was standing behind her, smiling slightly. 
	&quot;Sylia changed it again after you left,&quot; Priss told her as she typed the 
new one. &quot;She called Nene and asked her to inform you. I guess Nene forgot.&quot;
	&quot;I guess.&quot; Linna glowered as the door opened. &quot;She&#39;s got to stop 
behind so paranoid.&quot;
	&quot;She has her reasons.&quot; Priss followed her in, closing the door behind 
her. &quot;Why are you here?&quot;
	&quot;To get my wallet,&quot; Linna replied, holding it up. &quot;It must have fallen 
out of my coat.&quot;
	&quot;That right?&quot; Priss removed her red leather jacket. &quot;Linna, can I talk 
to you?&quot;
	&quot;Of course.&quot; She had seen this coming. Priss could not let go of Linna 
saving her earlier. She just had to talk about it. She was like that. Linna took a 
seat on the couch next to her. 
	&quot;About earlier...&quot;
	&quot;You don&#39;t need to thank me again,&quot; Linna broke in. &quot;It&#39;s part of being 
the Knight Sabers.&quot;
	&quot;That&#39;s not it.&quot; Priss shook her head. &quot;There&#39;s more to it.&quot;
	&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Linna cocked her head to the side. &quot;What more 
is there?&quot;
	&quot;I...&quot; Priss put a hand on Linna&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Linna, do you remember 
when I got angry because you talked about Sylvie?&quot;
	&quot;Yes.&quot;
	&quot;I was in love with Sylvie.&quot; Priss&#39; eyes shone with tears. &quot;I needed her. 
I made love to her once and once was more than enough to tell me that I loved 
her. It was the purest, sweetest thing that has ever happened to me. All my life 
I&#39;ve been searching for others and all my life I&#39;ve been disappointed. Suddenly 
Sylvie appeared and was so perfect. But... but she was designed to be that way.&quot;
	Linna nodded thought she did not understand. Priss had loved another 
woman? Sylvie? A Sexaroid?
	&quot;When I had to kill her, I was killing a part of me,&quot; Priss continued. &quot;I 
lost so much in her. My hopes lay in Anri. She was like an extension of Sylvie. 
I wanted to see her be happy. I didn&#39;t love her, and she wasn&#39;t even a friend. 
But I cared about her. Then she died and I was so obsessed with revenge. Sylia 
said that I did well, but I hardly scratched Largo. All my rage was that pathetic 
to him. It was your intervention that caused him to be destroyed. Altering the 
satellite was what truly killed him. Leon just finished what you started.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re saying, Priss...&quot; Linna swallowed, nervous as 
Priss leaned closer.
	&quot;Linna, you&#39;re so much like her. Like Sylvie, I mean. So giving, so 
caring. You think of others. You think of *me*.&quot;
	&quot;I do... But I don&#39;t think like *that*, Priss. You&#39;re my friend and my 
teammate, but...&quot; She was cut off when Priss kissed her roughly, suddenly. 
Linna struggled for a moment before she realized that she did not mind. It 
seemed so right. She fell into Priss&#39; embrace, returning it. She did not try to 
stop Priss when she felt her hands roaming around her body and fingering her 
nipples. She moaned with delight when Priss&#39; hands slipped into her panties 
and began to work on her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Linna&#39;s pants fell around her ankles and were removed in a moment as 
the two climbed onto the white bed in the patient&#39;s quarters. Priss was naked 
above her, undressing her as though she were a small child incapable of 
performing the task. Linna continued to run her finger in Priss&#39; clit as Priss 
finished her work and then lay beside Linna. The two acted mutually, each one 
touching as did the other. Linna moved her head down toward Priss thighs and 
licked at her sticky legs. She pushed her face against Priss&#39; vulva, causing Priss 
to groan with satisfaction. Linna&#39;s tongue pushed its way into Priss&#39; 
womanhood, entering and lapping up all of Priss&#39; cum. She licked harder until 
Priss reached her first orgasm. The rush of fluids hit Linna, who giggled a little 
with the sensations it gave to her.
	It was then Priss&#39; turn. Priss burrowed her own face at Linna&#39;s crotch. 
Linna heaved and sweated, thinking to herself all along that she could not 
possibly be doing this. Her nipples were hard, almost irritably so. Her body 
undulated as Priss worked her over, kissing all of her body. Their mouths met 
in a deep, passionate kiss as they slid their fingers into one another&#39;s twats. 
Their backs arched at once as they both hit their orgasms again, sending cum 
out over their bodies and the sheets. Priss&#39; legs were wrapped around Linna&#39;s as 
they went on with their motions, stroking one another as they hit their climax 
again and again. Inside her mind Linna was vaguely horrified. Her body, 
however, spoke of different feelings. 
	When they were finished, the two fell to the side in exhaustion. Linna 
shut her eyes, and within a moment sleep had overcome her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	When she awoke, Linna was in Priss&#39; arms. She was content as she lay 
her head against Priss&#39; breasts, watching Priss breathe. So this was what Priss 
had felt with Sylvie, she thought. It was incredible, like nothing else in the 
world. It was love.
