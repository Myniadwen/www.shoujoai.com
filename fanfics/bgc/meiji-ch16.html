<h1>Bubblegum Crisis: Meiji (part 16 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/meiji-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>She looked up at the sky as the first few drops began to fall, and 
smiled. Dark storm clouds were visible as far as the eye could see. The 
bad weather she&#39;d been waiting on for days now was finally here. As the 
rain began to pick up a little, she went into the forest to her left. 
She found a swampy area about fifty meters into the woods, filled with 
bogs and other hazards. She then saw a cave in a hill nearby, and began 
to head toward it in order to explore the interior. She stopped when she 
felt her right foot begin to sink in something. Stepping back, she 
looked down at the little trap she&#39;d almost fallen into, and began to 
laugh. This was going to be more fun than she ever could&#39;ve wished for.

The light drizzle had by now turned into a torrential downpour. The rain 
would be her ally, helping to obscure any evidence she might&#39;ve 
accidentally left on her way here. She was at least an hour ahead of the 
little group. If they&#39;d gone by train or boat, or if they&#39;d traveled 
straight through at top speed along the most frequented roads, they 
would&#39;ve been to Tokyo by now. But from what the Iga Clan hunting 
party&#39;s leader had told her, they were being trailed by the yakuza as 
well as by the o-niwaban. They couldn&#39;t afford to be seen in a public 
place such as the docks or the train depots, not with their traveling 
companion. And since the yakuza&#39;s influence extended to the checkpoints 
along the main routes, that forced her &quot;sister&quot; into traveling along 
this narrow, winding trail at a slow enough pace to escape attention.

Sylia wanted to be a hero, fine. Congratulations, sis; now here&#39;s your 
honorary Imperial albatross to hang around your neck.

Sylia was such an idiot. What the hell difference did it make what 
happened to Meiji Mutsuhito? As it was, the man they&#39;d come to save was 
now their biggest liability, slowing their progress down to a crawl.

As her hair hung in wet clumps next to her soaked white skin, she came 
out of the cave. It was perfect for what she needed. Once again making 
mental note of all the landmarks, and being careful not to step again 
into the hazard she&#39;d avoided only a few moments earlier, she made her 
way back to the main trail, leaving markings with her katana behind her 
on the trees and vines as she did so. Locating the bag she&#39;d left behind 
in its hiding spot, she opened it and quickly pulled out the necessary 
props.

It ended today.

The Emperor and the couple would go first. Sylia she would save for 
last. She wanted to savor the moment, make it last. She thought again 
about how much fun she&#39;d had cutting and humiliating her in front of the 
Emperor and her friends. She was just beginning to become turned on by 
Sylia&#39;s pain and fear when that baldheaded bitch went poking her nose in 
where it didn&#39;t belong. Galatia had used her scabbard to poke back, and 
she&#39;d fallen in a heap.

Galatia once again began to chuckle to herself. Not only was Sylia 
useless, but obviously so were her Knight Sabers as well.

Of course, seeing Sylia on all fours, cut up and gasping for air, wasn&#39;t 
nearly as arousing as what she had planed for her little one. Once the 
others were gone, and she had her to herself, and...

No. Mustn&#39;t loose focus.

Galatia ran the tip of her index finger along the blade of her katana. 
The sharp stinging pain helped to bring her back to reality. She found a 
tall tree which would give her a good vantage point and climbed it, 
being careful not to slip as the wind and rain picked up.

Soon, little one.

Soon.

------

The last three days had gone by fairly smoothly for the four member 
rescue party. Traveling incognito, and following the trail Nene had 
indicated in her letter, the men were making good time.

Well, all except for Police Chief Toodou, who hadn&#39;t been out on a horse 
for this long in years. Just as Leon had suspected, the man was a desk 
jockey, who had to struggle to keep up with the others and who&#39;d been 
dealing with chafing and saddle sores since day two. The fact that he 
and Leon very quickly learned they didn&#39;t like each other very much 
didn&#39;t help the time pass any quicker. But Toodou was the chief of the 
civilian police force. His men were in danger. Innocent people&#39;s lives 
were at stake. And there was no guarantee he would still receive a 
pension if Meiji was usurped from the throne.

The only thing more worrisome for Toodou than his pension was the fact 
that his niece, who went to a missionary school in Tanzania, was finally 
going to be coming up to visit in a month&#39;s time. He&#39;d never met Lisa 
before, and so was eagerly awaiting the event. He&#39;d helped her raise the 
money for the trip, and he&#39;d be damned if he was going to let her come 
into a war zone.

Colonel Roland smoked his pipe as he rode his steed with the others. He 
was worried about whether or not he&#39;d ever see his daughter Maria again, 
as well as whether they&#39;d be able to get back in time to prevent all-out 
war from occurring.

A short distance in front of Toodou and Roland, Leon and Daley rode 
silently. Leon turned to his friend with a worried look on his face.

&quot;How are you holding up, Wong?&quot; he asked. Daley took a deep breath.

&quot;It still hurts.&quot; he admitted, &quot;But at least going out on this crazy 
mission is helping me to take my mind off it. By the way,&quot; he said, 
deliberately changing the subject, &quot;supposing that the fair young tavern 
singer is there with the group, how are you going to handle it?&quot;

&quot;How am I going to... Daley, please. You&#39;re talking to an old pro when it 
comes to handling the ladies.&quot;

Daley smiled. Listening to Leon try to sound like he knew something 
about women was always good for a laugh.

&quot;You see Wong, the reason Priss hasn&#39;t given me the time of day up until 
now is...&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re a jerk?&quot;

&quot;Very funny. No, because she&#39;s already seeing someone. It all makes 
sense; that&#39;s why she won&#39;t see me and that&#39;s why she&#39;s always leaving 
so soon after performing at that little dive of hers. All I have to do 
is convince her to dump whoever he is and come with me instead.&quot;

Daley looked at him funny. &quot;You really think if she&#39;s with someone else, 
you could get her to leave him that easily?&quot;

Leon chuckled a bit, and then leaned over to Daley, a big grin on his 
face. &quot;Of course. It&#39;s all a matter of understanding how women work. You 
see,&quot; he said, lowering his voice like he was some sage passing along a 
great pearl of wisdom to a pupil, &quot;Women are incapable of rational 
thought.&quot;

Daly looked at him funny. &quot;Come again?&quot;

&quot;They can&#39;t think straight. Once their emotions get involved, all logic 
flies out the window. Now that poor young woman has become emotionally 
attached to some looser out there. All I have to do is get her to 
re-direct those emotions to me instead.&quot;

Daley looked at Leon and struggled not break down laughing. The man had 
yet to get any woman to &quot;re-direct&quot; anything his way since arriving in 
Tokyo other than a slap. Still, at least he was taking Daley&#39;s mind off 
his loss.

&quot;And naturally, the fact that you&#39;re on this little rescue mission will 
help with that, right?&quot;

&quot;Of course. Hell, the guy she&#39;s with now is obviously a looser, or else 
he&#39;d be helping her instead of us. I mean...&quot; Leon suddenly stopped when 
two men came out of the woods in front of him and Daley. Three more 
followed, then two more came out behind Roland and Toodou.

&quot;Oh shit.&quot; Leon whispered.

------

Nene was wet, cold and miserable.

Having drawn the shortest straw that morning, she was given the task of 
driving the wagon. Sure enough, she had to steer it in the middle of a 
rain storm. Even with the poncho on over her pink armor, the rain was 
seeping through, causing her teeth to chatter. In the wagon, Linna 
called out that the coffee she was cooking on the mini stove would be 
done soon, and that she&#39;d pass her a cup of it to keep her warm.

Ahead of her, she thought she saw some movement in the trees, but 
quickly dismissed the idea. They were all on edge, and were slowly 
becoming paranoid of every little sound or every unexplained motion 
among the trees and bushes they passed. And Nene was grudgingly willing 
to admit that she was more nervous than anyone else. Then again, she had 
a right to be. There was an assassin out there who had some sort of a 
weird crush on her, and from the way the others tried to avoid eye 
contact whenever she asked questions about Galatia, they obviously knew 
something about the woman she didn&#39;t. And it was just as obviously 
something bad.

Coming around a curve in the now muddy path, Nene struggled with the 
reigns trying to keep the horse and the wagon steady, when she saw an 
old woman in a woven kasa hat walking along the side of the road leaning 
on a cane. The hat covered her features, but the way she was bent over 
and the shabby clothing covering her suggested a poor woman well 
advanced in years. The horse was almost next to the woman before Nene 
noticed it.

The nails. The long, sharp nails.

Moving fast as lightning, the betsushikime drew her katana from her 
&quot;walking stick&quot; and sliced the horse&#39;s throat open, almost decapitating 
it. Nene started to scream, but the figure in black was already upon 
her.

Inside the wagon, all felt the wagon violently jolt to a halt and heard 
some sort of a commotion outside.

&quot;Nene?&quot; Sylia called out.

Nothing.

&quot;Nene, is everything all right?&quot; Linna now called out.

Nothing. No sound or movement. Something was definitely wrong.

Priss was the first to get to the front of the wagon and look out. She 
saw the horse hanging from its harness that attached it to the wagon, a 
large pool of blood forming underneath its still gushing neck. Ahead of 
her, she saw Galatia holding a bloody sword in her right hand and an 
unconscious Nene draped over her left shoulder, the blonde&#39;s hands bound 
behind her back. Their eyes met for a brief second, before Galatia 
flicked the blood from her sword and raced off into the thick foliage.

&quot;Shit!&quot; Priss yelled as she raced back into the wagon to grab her 
dotanuki.

&quot;Priss, what&#39;s going on? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Sylia asked, alarmed by the look 
on Priss&#39; face.

&quot;The bitch has Nene.&quot; She said as she put her helmet on and headed out 
after her.

&quot;Priss, wait!&quot; Linna yelled, as she quickly grabbed her own helmet and 
followed.

Sylia likewise stood up and started to move toward the front of the 
wagon, when she remembered the Emperor. She couldn&#39;t leave him behind, 
and she couldn&#39;t take him along into danger. She was stuck here.

------

Colonel Roland, Captain McNichol and the others reined their horses in 
as a group of the most hardened-looking thugs any of them could remember 
seeing began to encircle them. Besides the cutthroats, there were also 
three or four men who looked like former samurai, and a few who didn&#39;t 
seem to fit in either of the other two groups. Chief Toodou looked back 
nervously toward the path they&#39;d just come from where several yakuza had 
maneuvered themselves in order to cut off their escape route.

&quot;Chikusho (damn)!&quot; he muttered under his breath, &quot;Yakuza.&quot;

Daley turned to the other three with him. &quot;Follow my lead and do exactly 
as I say.&quot; He whispered. He got off his horse and stood straight.

&quot;Who is in charge here?&quot; he asked. An older man stepped forward.

&quot;I am, stranger. And you are?&quot;

As Leon and the others watched, Daley altered his stance so that he was 
standing with one foot in front of the other, his right hand extended in 
front of him and his left behind his back.

&quot;I am Wong of the Left Fist.&quot; he said, as he proceeded to follow through 
with the elaborate yakuza introduction ritual. Being a police officer, 
he&#39;d seen enough of the criminal element to know the proper way to act.

The leader of the group glared at him suspiciously. &quot;You, I could 
possibly see as a yakuza.&quot; he said, &quot;But those three?&quot; he indicated the 
others in the little rescue party, &quot;They&#39;re not even Japanese.&quot;

Wong shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Hey, what can I say; Tokyo is becoming a 
much more cosmopolitan town nowadays. And besides, it&#39;s not as if the 
Left Hand had all that many members to begin with. When you&#39;re located 
by the seaport, you take what you can get.&quot;

&quot;Maybe so, but...&quot;

&quot;(sigh) Look, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m enjoying traveling here with gaijin, you 
know. It wasn&#39;t my idea to let foreigners join the yakuza, it was our 
boss&#39;. I&#39;m just here with them because the big man told me to bring them 
along.&quot;

The leader looked at him with a bit less skepticism now. &quot;So Mason 
really sent you to help us deal with the Knight Sabers?&quot;

Daley smiled. &quot;Exactly, we&#39;re here because of the Knight Sabers.&quot;

&quot;Well then, welcome aboard.&quot; he said, passing Daley a bottle of sake. 
Toodou looked at Leon and Roland, all exchanging worried glances over 
what Daley had now gotten them into.

&quot;Hey,&quot; one of the others called out, &quot;Why aren&#39;t your men drinking sake 
too?&quot;

&quot;More sake for the Left Fist gang!&quot; another called out. Daley&#39;s cheeks 
were beginning to turn red from what he&#39;d already drunk when he felt 
chief Toodou&#39;s hand on his shoulder.

&quot;Wong-san, are you nuts?&quot; he whispered, &quot;How the hell are we supposed to 
pass ourselves off as yakuza?&quot;

&quot;I was wondering that myself.&quot; Colonel Roland whispered over.

&quot;I told you, just follow my lead.&quot; Daley mumbled, as another bottle was 
passed to him, along with one for the other three. &quot;Death to the Knight 
Sabers!&quot; he cried.

&quot;Death to the Knight Sabers!&quot; the others joined in on the toast, 
drinking from their sake. Leon looked over at his partner and then at 
the crooks and murderers surrounding him.

&quot;Well, when in Rome...&quot; he sighed, &quot;Death to the Knight Sabers!&quot;

------

Nene and the others looked on excitedly as the cabin came into view. 
After all the dangers, all the fears and heartbreaks, they were finally 
back with their loved ones. The sun shone brightly down on the wary 
group traveling across the field. It all seemed like some sort of 
wondrous dream.

Sylia&#39;s usually cool demeanor melted as she saw Nigel exit the cabin. 
She leapt out of the wagon and sprinted, bad leg and all, into his arms. 
As they embraced, the blonde saw Henderson now come out of the cabin, 
smiling as he waved to them. Then, finally, her beloved came out, 
smiling as he saw her. She was so happy, tears began to stream down her 
face as she rushed into Mackie&#39;s arms. He looked lovingly into her eyes 
as he stroked her face.

His hand was cold as death.

With a start, Nene opened her eyes; the back of her head was throbbing. 
She could hear thunder out in the distance, but couldn&#39;t see where she 
was or who was stroking her cheek. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning nearby 
lighted up the scene for her. She was in a cave, about fifteen feet from 
the entrance. And Galatia was the one softly stroking the Russian&#39;s 
face. The rain had caused her black eyeshadow to run down her face in 
sickening patterns, and her hair to hang in wet clumps along her neck 
and shoulders.

&quot;Oh, little one.&quot; Galatia cooed, &quot;Dear little one; why couldn&#39;t you have 
come on your own?&quot;

Nene tried to swat the assassin&#39;s hand away, but found she couldn&#39;t 
because her hands were tied behind her back. Panic gripped her as she 
looked around the dark interior of the cave the assassin had brought her 
to, her eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness. Ignoring the pain in the 
back of her head where Galatia had no doubt knocked her out, she 
attempted to scream out for help. Only muffled sounds came out. Galatia, 
it would seem, had taken the time to gag her as well.

&quot;Galatia!&quot; a voice called from outside the cave. &quot;Get out here, you 
bitch!&quot;

Nene realized it was Priss. Galatia picked up her katana and stood up.

&quot;Don&#39;t go away. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; She said as she ran out the cave 
entrance. Now alone, Nene began looking around for something she might 
be able to use to cut her cords, as thunder once again ripped through 
the sky.

Outside, Priss was looking around the swampy area she now found herself 
in. A movement to her left caught her attention, as she got her dotanuki 
up just in time to block Galatia&#39;s katana. Priss assumed a defensive 
stance as Galatia held her sword in her right hand, her left twirling 
the scabbard like a baton.

&quot;Where is she?&quot; Priss demanded.

&quot;Where&#39;s who?&quot;

&quot;You know who! Nene! Where&#39;s Nene!&quot;

Galatia didn&#39;t answer. Instead she suddenly came at Priss with her 
scabbard, hitting her hard in the ribs. She then swung her katana 
around, just missing Priss neck as the Knight Saber once again got her 
dotanuki up in time. Now it was Priss&#39; turn; she pressed the attack 
against Galatia, coming at her with thrusts and jabs. Galatia was 
continuing to use her sword and scabbard together to block and re-direct 
her blows, all the while subtly re-positioning her and Priss nearer to 
the naturally-occurring deathtrap she herself had almost slipped into 
earlier.

Linna now came out of the woods and into the swamp, pulling out her two 
swords as she did so. Priss saw her love out of the corner of her, and 
in the split second of distraction, Galatia gave her a roundhouse kick 
to her abdomen, sending her backward. She dropped her sword as she fell.

&quot;Priss!&quot; Linna screamed. Priss tried to get up, but somehow couldn&#39;t. It 
felt as if something was holding her down, pulling on her. Looking 
around, she finally realized what was happening; she was in quicksand up 
to her naval, and she was sinking fast.

Galatia looked down at the blue Knight Saber and smiled. She then placed 
herself between Linna and Priss. The scenario was perfect. Each would 
watch the other die; one by her sword, the other by slow asphyxiation in 
quicksand.

&quot;Your friend over there isn&#39;t very bright, is she?&quot; Galatia quipped to 
Linna. She then tilted her head slightly back to address Priss, all the 
while keeping her eyes on the green-clad figure in front of her. &quot;Priss, 
is it? Priss, I wouldn&#39;t try struggling to free yourself, dear. It&#39;ll 
only make you sink faster.&quot;

&quot;You fucking...&quot;

&quot;Priss-chan, hold on!&quot; Linna yelled, as fear for her love&#39;s safety began 
to grip her.

&quot;Heh, hold on? Hold on to what?&quot; Galatia hissed. &quot;You want to save her, 
you come through me. And this time, it&#39;ll be more than just your nose 
I&#39;ll break.&quot;

------

Sylia looked anxiously out the wagon front. The puddle of blood under 
the horse was already almost completely washed away, and the thunder 
storm was showing no signs of letting up. As she turned around, she saw 
the Emperor pull a pistol out of a trunk in the wagon.

&quot;Meiji-domo, what are you doing?&quot;

&quot;What does it look like I&#39;m doing? I&#39;m going out there to fight.&quot;

&quot;But you can&#39;t do that. She&#39;s a trained assassin, and...&quot;

&quot;Linna-san saved me from an extremely dangerous situation once. I am 
honor bound to her for that, and to the rest of you. I will not sit here 
and do nothing while that monster kills her and the others. Now are you 
coming or not?&quot;

Sylia could see that the Emperor was adamant about going out, and was 
loath to use the same technique on the Imperial Ruler of Japan that she 
had on the telegraph operator a few days ago.

&quot;Very well, Your Majesty. But you will stay out of the fighting. I&#39;ll 
help Priss and Linna, you must find Nene. No matter what happens to us, 
find her and get her out of here.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sylia-san understood.&quot;

&quot;Good, then follow me.&quot; she said, as both her and the Emperor exited the 
wagon and ran out into the woods, a bolt of lightning once again 
lighting up the sky above them.

---To Be Continued---

End Notes: Once again, for those playing at home (and those poor souls 
unfamiliar with the original Bubblegum Crisis OVA)-

Chapter Twelve: Raven appeared in episode four of the series. He was the 
owner of Raven&#39;s Garage, and basically took care of the Knight Sabers&#39; 
bikes and other mechanical needs. Sort of like Nigel in 2040, except 
there was no romantic ties between him and Sylia. I&#39;m not sure why I 
made him the sensei of the dojo Sylia trained at, except that it gave me 
a good excuse to throw him into the mix.

Chapter Sixteen: Lisa, Chief Toodou&#39;s niece, appeared in episode eight 
of the original series.</pre>
