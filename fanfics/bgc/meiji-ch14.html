<h1>Bubblegum Crisis: Meiji (part 14 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/meiji-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Warning: The scene with Galatia in it contains a brief description of 
self-mutilation. Nothing real bad, but if you find that too disturbing 
then please consider yourself forewarned.

------

Sylia held the sobbing young woman in her arms as she silently cursed 
herself for letting her go out alone, and for using up her ammunition in 
the temple so that she couldn&#39;t use her pistols to blow Galatia away 
yesterday. In between the sobs and near incoherent babblings she and the 
others had managed to put together a fairly accurate picture of what had 
happened. Galatia, it seemed, had developed some sort of a fixation on 
the Russian born Knight Saber.

Meiji was patting the blond on the back, trying with Sylia to comfort 
her, when both Linna and Priss came out of the woods. His right eyebrow 
arched a bit when he realized Priss was wearing a pair of men&#39;s hakama 
pants. Priss met his look, looked down, and shrugged her shoulders.

&quot;They&#39;re comfortable.&quot; she explained, answering his unasked question.

&quot;Sensei,&quot; Linna said, &quot;Me and Priss-chan searched the woods. There&#39;s no 
sign of her.&quot;

Sylia wasn&#39;t surprised. If Galatia didn&#39;t want to be found, she wouldn&#39;t 
be.

&quot;Alright, listen up.&quot; she began, &quot;From this point on, the armor will be 
worn at all times, except for sleeping, unless I say otherwise. Also, no 
one leaves the camp for any reason under any circumstances unless 
accompanied by another. Does everyone understand?&quot;

All nodded. Nene, pulling herself together a bit, slowly pushed herself 
off Sylia.

&quot;Understood.&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I lost it there, I...&quot;

Sylia put her hand up to Nene&#39;s cheek, a look of sadness on her own 
face.

&quot;I think you can be forgiven for loosing it there, Nene.&quot; she said, 
adding, &quot;Are you going to be able to continue now?&quot;

Nene looked at Sylia, and, mistaking her tone of concern for 
patronizing, surprised the leader of the Knight Sabers by her angry 
response.

&quot;I&#39;m not dead weight.&quot;

&quot;Wh... What?&quot;

&quot;Nor am I some damsel in distress, Sylia. I&#39;m a Knight Saber. I got 
caught off guard, and I got scared. It won&#39;t happen again.&quot;

&quot;Nene, I didn&#39;t mean...&quot;

Nene didn&#39;t stick around to listen. She walked off in a huff to the 
wagon to get her armor. Linna looked over to Sylia.

&quot;I&#39;ll go talk to her, Sensei.&quot; She said, just before following the 
younger woman. Priss stood by silently, watching the proceedings. The 
emperor now went up to Sylia, putting a hand on her shoulder.

&quot;It&#39;s not as easy as it looks, is it?&quot; he asked.

&quot;What isn&#39;t?&quot; Sylia asked back.

&quot;Leading. I&#39;ve been Emperor since &#39;67, and I can honestly tell you, 
there are times I wouldn&#39;t mind being just another subject, with no 
responsibilities or cares other than providing for his family. My 
family...&quot; Meiji suddenly took on a melancholy air that Sylia 
immediately picked up on.

&quot;You miss the Empress and your children, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Meiji smiled a bit, &quot;Yes, but I&#39;ll be seeing them again soon. You see, I 
trust your leadership Sylia-san. You&#39;ll get me back.&quot; He said, walking 
over to the wagon where Linna and Nene were talking. Priss and Sylia 
were now alone again.

&quot;Let me guess; you&#39;re going to bring up that damn gun again, aren&#39;t 
you?&quot; Sylia asked acerbically.

&quot;No. That can wait. We have the more pressing matter of that 
sword-wielding lunatic out there to contend with. How much about Galatia 
have you not told us about? And just what kind of danger is Nene is?&quot;

Sylia stared at Priss silently before walking off toward the dying 
embers of the campfire. Priss watched her walk off alone before turning 
around herself and joining the others near the wagon.

Mason looked critically at the group of men in front of him. 
Representatives of the yakuza, various wandering ronin for hire, and a 
good number of the dispossessed daimyo filled the conference room. Mason 
looked around and frowned when he noticed one particular former daimyo 
was missing. As he raised his hand, the chatter in the room ended and 
all eyes in the room focused on him.

&quot;Gentleman...&quot; he began in a loud voice so all could hear him, &quot;I need 
men. I need men to rid me of four very grievous annoyances.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve given you men.&quot; one of the yakuza bosses pointed out, &quot;We&#39;ve 
given you many men, in fact. And now, many men are dead. No one wants to 
work for you anymore. Not if it means dealing with those demons.&quot;

Mason&#39;s frown deepened.

&quot;They&#39;re not demons, you superstitious fool. They&#39;re human, same as you 
or me. The problem is they&#39;re better fighters than you.&quot; Mason ignored 
the outraged look on the yakuza&#39;s face as he continued, &quot;We&#39;ve been 
attacking them in insufficient numbers up until now. This isn&#39;t a job 
for ten or even fifteen men. This is a job for an army.&quot;

One of the ronin looked at Mason incredulously. &quot;An army? Against four 
women?&quot;

&quot;How large an army are we talking about?&quot; one of the former daimyo 
asked.

&quot;Thirty armed men, maybe forty.&quot; Mason stopped when he saw the man 
coming into the room. One look told him where the lecherous daimyo had 
been. He could even smell the brothel from here as its scents wafted off 
Kiyoshi&#39;s clothes and towards him. Dismissing the others, he now looked 
at the degenerate pig in front of him in disgust. He was a drunk. He was 
known to have victimized young girls and to have cheated his peasants 
almost to the point of starvation. And, finally, around the fall of the 
Tokugawa government, he was part of a failed attempted coup.

In short, he was perfect for what Mason had in mind.

&quot;You wanted to see me, Mason-san?&quot; Kiyoshi asked, his breath reeking of 
strong drink.

Mason smiled. &quot;Kiyoshi-sama, how would you like to become Imperial Ruler 
of all Japan?&quot;

---That Evening---

Sylia watched over the camp under the starlit canopy of night. Sitting 
by the campfire on an overturned log she watched as Nene stirred 
uneasily in her sleep near the Emperor, no doubt haunted by the 
nightmares of what had happened earlier today. She looked on sadly as 
the youngest Knight Saber struggled with her night terrors. Out of the 
corner of her eye she saw Priss and Linna, holding hands, walk up to 
her.

&quot;Yes, ladies?&quot; Sylia asked, judging by their looks that they wished to 
talk.

&quot;Sylia,&quot; Priss began, &quot;We need to know about Galatia.&quot;

Sylia grimaced, partly from the pain in her still tender wounds of 
yesterday afternoon, partly from reluctance to re-open old wounds.

&quot;I already told you all you need to know. She&#39;s a betsushikime, an 
assassin. Her style involves a two handed attack much like Linna&#39;s, and 
...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what we mean and you know it.&quot; Priss said, narrowing her 
eyes.

&quot;Sensei, please.&quot; Linna interrupted, &quot;We need to know everything. We 
need to know all of it. Does not Sun Tzu teach to know the enemy better 
than they know themselves?&quot;

Sylia looked away from both of them. &quot;Please... Please don&#39;t make me do 
this. You don&#39;t know what it is you&#39;re asking. Some pains are best left 
in the past, some wounds...&quot;

&quot;Everything.&quot; Priss said demandingly.

Sylia turned back to them, the look on her face speaking of pain and 
heartbreak as her mind raced back to seven years ago.

&quot;I... was sixteen,&quot; she began hesitantly, &quot;A student at Sensei Raven&#39;s 
dojo when I first met her. She... she was only a few months older than 
me, but acted so much more mature that I always thought of her as my 
&#145;big sister.&#39; Her father was a Missionary Priest, and her mother a woman 
who met him in the confessional. Obviously not the best of scenarios, 
the mother was sent off to a nunnery, where she had the child. Galatia 
was immediately given up for adoption to an abusive family, running away 
from the household in her early teens. How she learned martial arts, and 
how she became so proficient at it I never found out. Sensei teamed us 
up as sparring partners and I... I fell in love at first sight.&quot;

The sad look in Sylia&#39;s eyes only intensified as she took a deep breath 
and continued her story.

&quot;I can still remember the first time we kissed. It was my first time 
kissing anybody. She guided me in the encounter that followed.&quot; Sylia 
closed her eyes, as the long buried memories came flooding back, 
memories both good and bad. Galatia had been both intense and relentless 
that first session of love making following the kiss, leaving her 
breathless afterward, almost physically drained.

&quot;Things began to sour in short order.&quot; Sylia said as she picked up her 
story, &quot;I&#39;d fallen in love with the older girl, but soon realized she 
didn&#39;t love me as much as she loved my body. She... lusted for me, but 
she didn&#39;t love. I don&#39;t know if she can love, to be honest. As time 
began to go by, Galatia began to, well, introduce things into our time 
together.&quot;

&quot;Things?&quot; Linna asked in concern, &quot;Sensei, what kind of things?&quot;

Sylia took another deep breath, &quot;Bizarre things.&quot; she almost whispered. 
&quot;I can remember one morning waking up early, before anyone else at the 
dojo, or so I thought. I went out into the garden, and saw Galatia 
standing there with her back to me, about four or five dead birds 
surrounding her. She must&#39;ve heard me, because she then turned around, 
another bird in her hands. As I watched, she broke the thing&#39;s neck. She 
then looked at me, and smiled. Looking back, the incident was a 
foretelling of things to come.&quot;

&quot;Galatia seemed to get some perverse pleasure from inflicting pain on 
others. I&#39;m... I&#39;m not sure why I put up with it for so long, other than 
at first I still had feelings for her and...&quot; as Linna and Priss 
watched, a tear began to run down their leader&#39;s right cheek, followed 
by another down her left. Sylia fought to keep her voice steady as she 
continued, &quot;...and she was tutoring me on the side in exchange for our 
sessions together.&quot; Sylia paused for a moment before continuing. &quot;Near 
the end, all romantic pretenses were set aside as Galatia used me as her 
gunny pig, trying to see just how far she could push me. Our sensei 
first began to suspect something was wrong when he saw the teeth marks 
on my upper arm...&quot;

Linna allowed a gasp to escape. Priss (suddenly feeling ashamed over 
making her former lover relive such painful memories) went over and sat 
next to Sylia, putting her arm around her as she did so.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Sylia. I had no idea. If you don&#39;t want to go on, we&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;Do you remember the scar just above my tailbone? The one about six 
inches long?&quot;

Priss looked over nervously to Linna, then nodded back to Sylia. &quot;Yeah, 
the battlefield injury.&quot;

Sylia wiped a tear from her face as she looked away from Priss and 
Linna. &quot;I lied. It wasn&#39;t a battlefield injury. It... it was the final 
straw. The one that prompted me to ended my relationship with the older 
girl.&quot;

Priss was stunned. &quot;Sylia, you&#39;re the most confident, strongest, in 
control person I know. How could you have allowed...&quot;

&quot;I was young, Priss. I was inexperienced, and I was blinded in my desire 
for revenge against those who killed my parents into believing that it 
was worth it if I could become a better warrior afterward. Later, I 
caught her trying to steal scrolls from Sensei Raven containing secret 
fighting techniques. I turned her in. I heard stories of what happened 
to her after the expulsion. Stories of murder, cruelty, assassinations 
and sadism. I came to realize that the girl I fell in love with in the 
dojo long ago was nothing more than a sociopath who killed and maimed 
only secondarily for the money. It was the thrill of inflicting pain 
that moved her, that still does move her. Those who hire Galatia don&#39;t 
hire her to simply kill a target; they hire her to mutilate.&quot;

Linna now came over, a feeling of dread falling upon her.

&quot;Sensei,&quot; she began, &quot;If what you&#39;ve told us is true, then if this 
monster, if she got her hands on Nene...&quot;

Sylia stood up and looked Linna in the eyes, forgetting her painful 
memories for the moment. &quot;Linna, don&#39;t loose focus. As much as we care 
for Nene, we&#39;re all in danger. Our top priority is still the Emperor. Do 
you understand?&quot;

Linna looked Sylia in the eyes as she nodded. She then quite 
unexpectedly went up and hugged the older woman.

&quot;Sensei, I&#39;m sorry you went through that. I... I wish I knew what to 
say.&quot;

Sylia smiled as she hugged the former geisha back, being careful to 
avoid touching her still injured nose. She let Linna go, and turned to 
Priss.

&quot;Priss,&quot; she said, as she wiped her eyes again with her hand, &quot;The 
Emperor was right; you&#39;d better be good to her.&quot; She said, pointing to 
Linna. Linna was glad the dark sky would be able to hide her blushing.

---Four Days Later---

She watched the blood slowly run down her arm, her face an emotionless 
mask as she focused on the pain. Using her katana, she cut into her arm 
again. She was in control now. She was the one giving the pain, and she 
was the one who could stop the pain. Not like her childhood. Not like 
her adoptive parents. Not like her adoptive father who snuck into her 
bedroom and...

Galatia closed her eyes, smiling with satisfaction as she remembered 
what she did to &quot;dear daddy&quot; after her expulsion from the dojo. Opening 
them again, she looked through half-closed lids to see the patterns the 
blood made on its trip from her upper arms to her fingertips, where it 
clotted and dripped down onto the grass under her feet. Besides giving 
her a sense of control, the pain helped her to bring herself into focus. 
She then knelt by the nearby stream, watching the blood drip from her 
arm into the water as she began to consider things.

Drip. Drip.

The blood diffused in the water, loosing its color.

Drip.

Sylia. Her dear sister from the dojo. Galatia frowned when she thought 
back to the fun that she was having playing with Sylia being interrupted 
by that damn nuisance in the nun outfit. She then chuckled a bit 
remembering her trying to get up, looking like a fish thrown onto dry 
land every time she&#39;d kicked her back down. She was looking forward to 
the fun her and her &#145;dear sister&#39; would be having together again in the 
near future.

Drip.

The emperor. Galatia killed for the thrill, sure. But nothing was more 
thrilling than to kill a man. First off, she had a natural hatred for 
the hairy beasts. And secondly, whenever she killed one, she could see 
herself killing her adoptive father all over again, savoring the fear 
and pain involved. She&#39;d never killed Royalty before, though. That would 
no doubt add a whole new thrill to the proceedings.

Drip.

The other two. The couple. She didn&#39;t know who they were, and she didn&#39;t 
care. One was the annoying bitch whose nose she&#39;d broken in order to 
teach the wench a lesson in manners. The other one, judging from what 
she&#39;d been able to make out through the telescope, and the fact the 
young woman seemed to take responsibility for the most strenuous tasks 
whenever they set up or took down camp each day, was the muscle of the 
group. Not knowing them, it was hard to bring herself to care much about 
them. Maybe she could have fun killing one of them in front of the 
other.

Drip.

Nene.

Drip.

The little one.

Drip.

Her little one.

Drip.

She was so soft, so warm. Her eyes were blue like the sky, hair the same 
color yellow as the sunflower. Galatia felt a shiver run through her as 
she remembered her encounter with the blond. She had rather hoped the 
girl would&#39;ve come with her willingly.

Drip.

But if not, Galatia supposed she would just have to take her.

Drip.

She began to wrap a bandage around her arm where the cut marks were, 
thinking as she did so of all the fun she was going to have in the near 
future with her little one, after she got rid of Sylia and the others of 
course. She left the stream she&#39;d been kneeling by and moved forward 
into the woods.

------

The telegraph operator in Osaka was an older man with a small gray 
mustache and a wife at home preparing a meal of pickled vegetables and 
fish for when he got off work. At the sound of the bell hanging over the 
door, he looked up to see a rather unusual sight. A Japanese man in his 
late twenties traveling with two European women. While both his escorts 
wore bonnets over their heads, he was able to see that one of them had 
light colored hair, almost of a golden color.

&quot;Hello, may I help you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, good sir.&quot; the man spoke up, &quot;We wish to use your telegraph 
machine for a few minutes.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Wish to use...&#39; If you give me the message I&#39;d be more than happy to 
sent it for you sir.&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, we can&#39;t do that. The message is of a highly sensitive 
nature and...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry sir, but as the operator I&#39;m not allowed to let anyone else 
use the machine but either myself or another authorized operator.&quot;

As he began at length to explain the rules and regulations involved with 
the high office of telegraph operator, the taller of the two women with 
the stranger began to slink forward. As he turned his attention over to 
the attractive woman, she smiled at him and reached out a hand to cup 
his left cheek. She then began slowly lowering her hand against his face 
and down his neck, sending goose bumps down the operator&#39;s body as she 
did so. Once her hand reached his collar, her expression changed as she 
gritted her teeth and pinched hard on the pressure point, applying an 
almost vice-like grip to the baroreceptors of the carotid sinus located 
there. The telegraph operator&#39;s eyes rolled back as he fell unconscious 
onto the desk.

&quot;My word.&quot; Meiji gasped.

&quot;Nene, get over here and send out the messages to the British Military 
outpost and the Imperial Guard station.&quot; Sylia ordered.

&quot;I&#39;m on it.&quot; Nene said as she ran around the counter, began rewiring the 
switch board frantically, and started telegraphing out the two messages.

&quot;And hurry.&quot; Sylia said, looking nervously over toward the door. &quot;We 
don&#39;t know how long he&#39;ll be out or how soon before someone else may 
come in here.&quot;

&quot;Sylia-san,&quot; Meiji broke in, &quot;Are you sure it&#39;s such a good idea to 
contact the Imperial Guard? After what has happened, how do we know we 
can trust them?&quot;

&quot;Before we left, an informant on the inside assured me that while your 
cabinet ministers have all betrayed you, your guard has not.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but that was then. I&#39;ve been gone a while now and... You have 
informants inside the palace? My palace?&quot;

Sylia fought the urge to roll her eyes at Emperor Meiji&#39;s reaction to 
her unfortunate slip of the tongue. As she looked back over to the 
telegraph, Nene was finishing up rewiring the board the way it was when 
they first entered, both requests for help now having been sent. Sylia 
wasn&#39;t happy about having to contact others for backup. If it were up to 
her, she&#39;d rather have the Knight Sabers complete this mission on their 
own. Unfortunately, Galatia was a joker in the deck she hadn&#39;t counted 
on.

Nene crossed over around the desk to join her and Meiji just as an 
attractive lady came in. Looking over at the group and the operator 
slouched out across the desk, she was about to scream bloody murder when 
the Emperor suddenly spoke up.

&quot;Thank goodness you came!&quot; he said excitedly. &quot;Something&#39;s wrong with 
this poor man, he fell over as we were talking to him. Could you stay 
here with him while we go and get some help?&quot;

&quot;What? Oh, of course.&quot; the woman said, obviously relieved her earlier 
fears were unfounded; &quot;I&#39;m a doctor myself, out here visiting a sick 
friend anyways. Hurry on; I&#39;ll tend to him until you send some help.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Miss...&quot;

&quot;Megumi. Now go, get help.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Megumi-san.&quot; Turning to his two traveling companions, &quot;Well, 
shall we go?&quot;

&quot;Yes, lets.&quot; Sylia said, as she and Nene followed the Emperor in a hasty 
exit.
