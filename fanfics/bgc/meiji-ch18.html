<h1>Bubblegum Crisis: Meiji (part 18 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../bgc/meiji-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Brian J. Mason looked impatiently at the grandfather clock, noting the 
time. Where was he? He was supposed to be here half an hour ago with the 
necessary documentation.

A knock at the door pulled him out of his sullen thoughts.

&quot;Mr. Mason,&quot; his secretary called, &quot;Masamune-san is here to see you.&quot;

&quot;Good. Send him in.&quot;

A small middle aged Japanese man with thinning hair and glasses slowly 
walked in carrying a pile of papers. Mason studied the man 
disinterestedly from his desk before getting up from his chair to come 
over to him.

&quot;Well?&quot; he asked. The older man began nervously fidgeting with the 
papers in his hands.

&quot;Um, let&#39;s see. It wasn&#39;t easy to find, mind you. And it took much 
longer to dig up than I...&quot;

&quot;Get to the point, Masamune. Did you or did you not find anything?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mason-san. Nine generations back, under Emperor Go-Mizunoo 
(Emperor from 1615-1680). One of Kiyoshi&#39;s ancestors on his father&#39;s 
side seems to have been a lady in the court who was cast off, supposedly 
due to being with child outside of marriage.&quot;

&quot;Was there any record of the father ever having been discovered.&quot;

&quot;None, Mason-san.&quot;

Mason smiled malevolently at Masamune, &quot;So it could&#39;ve been Emperor 
Go-Mizunoo&#39;s, correct.&quot;

&quot;Well, I suppose anything&#39;s possible. But then one could just as easily 
argue it was the stable boy&#39;s or the cook&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Nevertheless, the possibility is at least raised.&quot; Mason said more to 
himself than to the man in front of him. If he could raise the 
possibility that Kiyoshi was a blood descendant of an Emperor, even if 
illegitimately, it would make his plans much easier to carry out.

&quot;Any word yet on the location of the rest of the royal family?&quot;

&quot;None yet, sir. We only know they are most likely under British 
protection.&quot;

&quot;Keep up the search. We need them eliminated, especially the young 
prince.&quot;

As his lackey left, his secretary came back in.

&quot;Mr. Mason, sir?&quot;

&quot;Yes, what is it?&quot;

&quot;Well sir, we&#39;ve found Kiyoshi, but...&quot;

&quot;Let me guess; he&#39;s at Madam Shizue&#39;s brothel, right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir. Shall I send for him?&quot;

&quot;No, not yet. Let the drunken slob have his fun.&quot;

&quot;Very good, sir. Will there be anything else?&quot;

&quot;No, not for now. Good day.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir. Oh, I almost forgot; a cable came from across the Sea of 
Japan. The ship with the weapons shipment should be here within two 
weeks.&quot;

Mason&#39;s eyes lit up at that. He&#39;d been waiting to hear those magical 
words now for weeks. Once the shipment came in, the profits from their 
sale to those yellow savages out there would put him over with the Genom 
board. And now that he&#39;d seen to it that Rosenkreutz would never return 
he, Brian J. Mason, was a shoe in for Chairman of the Board.

As his secretary left, Mason poured himself some more wine, sat back 
behind his desk, and relaxed. Things were going his way, and no one was 
around to stop him.

------

Priss was stuck in the quicksand up to her chin now. She was frozen 
solid, her body shaking uncontrollably. Suddenly, a dark figure started 
to rise out of the slimy substance in front of her. Her eyes opened wide 
in dismay as the shadowy kappa (water demon) began to move toward her. 
As she sunk to the point were her mouth was now submerged, the blurry, 
vapory figure slowly started to take on a human form. Now reaching a 
hand out to her, Priss could make out what it was. It wasn&#39;t a kappa at 
all.

It was a geisha.

As Priss reached out, the stunningly beautiful woman with the painted 
face took her hand, smiling at her as she pulled her with ease out of 
the deadly morass. Bringing her safely to dry land, the geisha cupped 
her cheeks in her hands as she came closer. She tilted her head to 
Priss&#39; as she opened her mouth and closed her eyes...

Priss opened her eyes to find herself sweltering under a pile of 
blankets. Linna was curled up next to her, her right arm under her head 
and her left arm around her midsection. Priss could feel their legs were 
intertwined as well. Looking beneath the blankets, she saw that her body 
was covered in a grayish-brown layer of dirt. As she looked back to the 
young woman still sleeping in front of her, the memories of the previous 
day came flooding back.

Her Linna, her beloved geisha, had saved her life. She looked at her 
sleeping form, at her chest rising and lowering with each breath. As she 
watched, Linna&#39;s face suddenly took on a sad expression.

&quot;No...&quot; she murmured in her sleep, &quot;No...&quot;

Priss began to gently stroke her cheek, waking her up. Linna opened her 
eyes to find Priss looking at her with concern.

&quot;Linna-chan.&quot; Priss said, &quot;Hon, you were having a nightmare.&quot;

Linna&#39;s eyes teared up as she pulled Priss over to her, burying her face 
in her shoulder.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t get too close to me right now,&quot; Priss tried to joke, &quot;I 
smell pretty nasty after my dirt bath yesterday.&quot;

Linna either didn&#39;t hear her or didn&#39;t care. &quot;I... I dreamed that I... lost 
you, and...&quot; she couldn&#39;t get anymore out. Priss began to brush her 
fingers through the thick stubble growing on her head where she&#39;d shaved 
her hair off. If Linna were to wear men&#39;s clothes, Priss mused, one 
might easily mistake her for an effeminate looking boy. As she tilted 
Linna&#39;s head back, she smiled one of her rare smiles at her, the kind 
that made the former geisha feel warm inside.

Priss brought her lips to Linna&#39;s, her beloved melting in her embrace. 
At last pulling back, she looked into Linna&#39;s eyes.

&quot;You saved my life.&quot; she whispered, &quot;I&#39;d be dead right now if it wasn&#39;t 
for you.&quot;

Linna blushed. &quot;You&#39;d have done the same for me, my love.&quot;

Priss continued to look into her beloved&#39;s eyes as she stroked her 
cheek, leaning forward so their foreheads touched. As they continued to 
cuddle, Priss remembered something.

&quot;Linna-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm?&quot;

&quot;Where are the others?&quot;

------

She slowly opened her eyes and looked outside the tunnel entrance to see 
that the rain had stopped overnight and the clouds were dissipating in 
the morning sky. Near her, she could hear the other two snoring. Looking 
under the nightgown she had Nene grab for her last night, she winced at 
the sight of her blood-soaked bandages. She then looked over to her two 
traveling companions, both still sound asleep. The Emperor had insisted 
on Nene and her taking the only two mats, and as a result had paid for 
being a gentleman by sleeping on the floor of the cave.

As she watched the youngest member of her team sleep, she understood a 
bit of why Galatia had been so infatuated. She was cute, after all, what 
with that little button nose and those big eyes...

&#39;What in the hell am I thinking?&#39; Sylia thought to herself as she 
quickly shook her head clear of the mental images threatening to present 
themselves. Taking a deep breath, she slowly began the painful process 
of getting up off the mat and getting to her feet.

Nene was annoyed to be woken to the sound of a puppy dog whimpering. 
Looking around sleepily through half-closed lids, her eyes came upon 
Sylia, and realized it wasn&#39;t a puppy, but her leader, whose stifled 
sounds of pain woke her. She watched as tears formed at the corners of 
Sylia&#39;s eyes from the pain she was undergoing as she tried to stand up. 
Alarmed, the young woman rushed over, giving her a helping hand. Once 
the leader of the Knight Sabers was on her feet, she allowed Nene to 
take her arm and drape it around her shoulder so she could use the young 
blond for support.

&quot;Nene?&quot; Sylia said, trying to ignore her lightheadedness and pain.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Are you sure you telegraphed those two messages to British Military 
headquarters and the Palace Guards?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sylia, I did just as you told me.&quot; Nene answered a bit 
defensively. Sylia made a face as she looked again out the cave 
entrance.

&quot;Where in the hell could they be?&quot; she asked.

------

&quot;Where the hell are we?&quot; Captain Leon McNichol asked.

The four men had been traveling since eleven o&#39;clock the previous night. 
They were working on two hours sleep in the last thirty-six hours 
(except for Leon, who&#39;d slept an extra four after he&#39;d passed out from 
too much sake). After being caught in the rain last night, they were 
cold, wet, and tired. As each was nursing his own hangover, Colonel 
Roland looked back toward his fellow officer.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter where we are. As long as we stay on this road, we&#39;re 
sure to reach them eventually.&quot;

&quot;If they&#39;re still alive.&quot; Police Chief Toodou added.

&quot;What do you mean &#39;if&#39;?&quot; Leon asked angrily, &quot;We&#39;d already be to them if 
you weren&#39;t slowing us down.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the one who had to stop every twenty minutes back there to 
throw up.&quot; Toodou angrily countered.

&quot;Gentleman, please.&quot; Daley interrupted. &quot;Our mission is hard enough 
without our bickering amongst ourselves. We&#39;re only a few hours ahead of 
those fugitives back there, and now we have to save a group of strangers 
in a cabin along with the Emperor and Nene.&quot;

&quot;And the Knight Sabers.&quot; Leon added. Roland glared at him.

&quot;Captain McNichol, are you forgetting that these women are dangerous 
vigilantes who have openly broken the sword control laws on numerous 
occasions and placed innocent civilians in danger by their reckless 
acts?&quot;

Chief Toodou nodded. &quot;Agreed. Once we meet up with them, the first thing 
to do (after assuring the Emperor&#39;s safety, of course) is to place those 
women in custody.&quot;

Both Daley and Leon were shocked.

&quot;Are you suggesting we arrest them? After they themselves have put their 
lives on the line to save the Emperor?&quot; Daley asked incredulously.

&quot;Yes, officer Wong. That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m suggesting.&quot; Toodou 
answered.

&quot;Look,&quot; Roland said. &quot;You remember that fire at the Silky Doll, right? 
Most of those bodies were burned beyond recognition, but those that 
weren&#39;t were identified as ninjas by their clothing and weapons. 
Obviously a fight took place, and I&#39;m willing to bet that those Knight 
Sabers were in on it. And what happened? The place burned to the ground. 
We couldn&#39;t even identify the remains of the poor owner Miss Stingray or 
her butler.&quot; Colonel Roland paused, sadly remembering the pretty young 
lass with the bow in her hair who always went out with her umbrella and 
always had a smile for him when they passed on the street. &quot;The fact 
that the fire didn&#39;t spread to other buildings in the vicinity was a 
miracle. They&#39;re a menace, just as much as those they fight.&quot;

Daley and Leon looked at each other, both thinking the same thing, &#39;If 
they find out about the note left in the basement, and about what we 
know about Sylia, we&#39;re both dead meat.&#39;

------

The five horsemen rode along the winding path, passing the bottle of 
sake between themselves in the morning chill.

&quot;So what are we supposed to be doing again?&quot; one of them asked.

&quot;Baka, how many times do I have to tell you?&quot; a second member of the 
little group answered. &quot;There&#39;s twenty-four coming here from Tokyo to 
kill Meiji and those four sluts from the temple. We&#39;re coming from this 
direction to cut off any escape route.&quot;

&quot;What happens if we run into them first?&quot; a third asked.

&quot;Leave it to me.&quot; The second one said. &quot;I can kill them all by myself.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; the fourth one asked. &quot;Look, just because you were able to 
kill an unarmed nun running out of a temple doesn&#39;t mean...&quot;

&quot;Shhh, quiet.&quot; the fifth member of the group whispered, &quot;Look at this.&quot;

They all looked ahead to see what he was pointing at. There, ahead of 
them, was a wagon with a horse carcass still attached to it.

&quot;What do you make of that?&quot; the fourth asked.

&quot;Must&#39;ve encountered robbers along the road. Look at the way the horse&#39;s 
neck was cut.&quot;

&quot;Do you suppose they left anything behind?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s tie our horses off at that log over there and check it out.&quot;

------

Linna was tying her scarf around her head as Priss reluctantly dressed, 
still covered in filth from yesterday. Making a silent vow to bathe as 
soon as humanly possible, she finished putting on her men&#39;s hakama 
pants, tucking her dotanuki into her sash as Linna was putting both her 
katana in her obi (kimono sash). They both started for the front of the 
wagon to go check up on Sylia and the others, when they heard movement 
outside.

Linna and Priss both exchanged worried glances.

&quot;Wait here.&quot; Priss said as she cautiously turned around and made her way 
to the back of the wagon, opening the curtain and sticking her head out.

There, outside the wagon, were five drunk men, the distinctive clothing 
they wore showing themselves to be yakuza.

&quot;Hey, lads, what have we here?&quot; one of them asked.

&quot;Looks like a little tart.&quot; another answered.

&quot;I want first crack at her.&quot;

&quot;No way! Last time you had first crack, you strangled the bitch to death 
before any of us could have a crack at her!&quot;

&quot;Well she was struggling.&quot;

&quot;Struggling? She couldn&#39;t have been more than twelve. How hard could she 
have been struggling against you?&quot; he asked, referring to the one man&#39;s 
muscle mass.&quot;

Priss&#39; eyes narrowed as she firmly placed her left hand on the hilt of 
her sword, her thumb pushing the blade an inch out of the scabbard. 
Linna, hearing the conversation, silently opened the flap in the front, 
withdrawing her two swords as she crouched down in the seat behind the 
dead horse.

The men, still unaware of Linna&#39;s presence, turned their attention away 
from bickering with each other and back toward Priss.

&quot;Hey bitch.&quot; one of them called over to her, &quot;Why you so quiet? Usually 
most other bitches would be crying by now or begging for mercy.&quot;

Priss surprised the five men in front of her by smiling a bit at the 
corner of her mouth.

&quot;Tell you what, boys.&quot; she began, &quot;It&#39;s early, and I&#39;m still tired, so 
I&#39;m going to make you a deal. You leave the horses over there, turn 
around and run for your lives, and I won&#39;t have to kill any of you.&quot;

The men looked at one another, then back to Priss, before they all 
started laughing.

&quot;Look out, I&#39;ll take her first.&quot; One of them said, lunging forward with 
his hand to grab her.

In an instant, the wagon flap was open as Priss flew out, unsheathing 
her sword in a flash of movement. She landed on the ground just before 
her would-be assailant&#39;s arm did.

&quot;Aaargh! My... my... Aaaa!&quot; The man screamed as his fellow yakuza unsheathed 
their swords and came at the woman holding the bloody sword. As Priss 
sliced through one man&#39;s torso, the one-armed man came up behind her, 
his sword withdrawn prepared to strike. A quick flash of steel later, 
however, and he fell dead behind her.

&quot;Shit! There&#39;s two of them!&quot; The more muscular one yelled out. Linna 
swung both katana toward the nearest fighter, her left blade blocking 
his hand as her right decapitated him. The muscular one now looked to 
his only companion left standing.

&quot;Well, go ahead.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You said you could kill all the Knight Sabers yourself if you had to, 
right? Well, there&#39;s only two of them, so this should be easy.&quot;

Priss held her dotanuki at the ready, waiting for the next attack from 
the two men left standing. As she looked over to Linna, however, she saw 
a strange look in her beloved&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Linna-chan?&quot; Priss asked worriedly, thinking she might&#39;ve been injured. 
&quot;Linna, what...&quot;

&quot;You.&quot; Linna growled, pointing at one of the men with the bloody tip of 
her right katana, &quot;You were the one that killed Irene.&quot;

The man she was pointing to suddenly became very scared. &quot;What? Irene? I 
don&#39;t know any...&quot;

Priss turned away from Linna and her opponent to focus on the muscular 
brute coming at her. As he raised his sword, she delivered a swift, 
well-placed kick between his legs, sending him to the ground.

&quot;That was for the twelve-year old.&quot; she said as she buried her sword in 
his chest, pulling it out just before he fell dead before her feet.

&quot;The nun!&quot; Priss heard Linna shout as she started to stalk toward the 
man in front of her. &quot;You killed her as she was coming out of the 
temple!&quot;

Before he had time to react, she was upon him. As she forced him to 
block her right side, her left blade came around, gutting him.

&quot;Linna-chan?&quot;

Linna stood there, looking down at the dead body of the man who&#39;d 
murdered her friend back at the temple, tears starting to silently run 
down her cheeks.

&quot;Linna-chan, it&#39;s over.&quot;

Linna looked over to Priss, who was re-sheathing her sword. She quietly 
flicked the blood off both her weapons before putting them back away in 
her scabbards. Priss put an arm around her shoulder, and began to lead 
her away from the carnage and into the woods.

&quot;Come on, anata (dear), let&#39;s go tell Sylia and the others the good 
news.&quot;

Linna looked at her love in surprise. &quot;Good news?&quot; she asked, now 
looking back at the corpses they were leaving behind, &quot;What good news.&quot;

Priss smiled at her, &quot;The acquisition of five horses, of course.&quot;

---That Evening---

&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; Nigel asked.

&quot;Indeed I did, sir.&quot; Henderson said, alarmed. &quot;Someone&#39;s knocking at the 
door.&quot;

&quot;Take this.&quot; Nigel said, passing the butler a gun, &quot;Go into Mackey&#39;s 
room. Don&#39;t come out unless I tell you it&#39;s safe.&quot;

&quot;Very good, sir.&quot; Henderson answered, making his way to the young man&#39;s 
room. Nigel waited until he was out of sight before opening the door. He 
and the two men on the other side stared silently at each other for a 
second or two before Nigel finally broke the silence.

&quot;May I help you?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Yes, well no. Er, that is, you see...&quot;

&quot;Forgive Captain McNichol, sir. My name&#39;s Colonel Roland, and we&#39;re both 
from the British military outpost in Tokyo. You and everyone else in 
this cabin are in grave danger.&quot;</pre>
