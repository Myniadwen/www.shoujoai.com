<a href="../bgc/redcry-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Sylia stopped in front of her hallway mirror a moment, and adjusted 
her tie. She stepped out of her room only to be met by a frowning 
Mackie. He walked a small circle around her only to stop and nod, 
firmly. &quot;You look good,&quot; he said with a smile. As an afterthought, he 
reached up to loosen her tie, giving it a bit more of a rakish look.

&quot;Hey,&quot; she protested loudly, only to have him give her a look.

&quot;Trust me, it looks better that way,&quot; Mackie reassured her. He smiled 
a bit, &quot;Good luck, sis. I hope things turn out the way you want them 
to tonight.&quot;

Sylia blushed a bit. &quot;What do you think you know, young man?&quot; she 
asked him cautiously, then waited for his answer.

Mackie smiled up at her. &quot;I know Linna&#39;s good for you, big sister. And 
I hope she feels the same way about you,&quot; he said with a shrug. He 
walked up the hall, adding over his shoulder, &quot;I won&#39;t wait up for 
you!&quot;

She was about to respond to his comment when she noticed the time. She 
snatched up her keys and took the lift down to the parking garage. 
Picking out her favorite roadster, she started it up, noting the 
smooth hum of the engine and the full fuel gage.

&quot;Thanks, Mackie,&quot; Sylia said softly, and sped off.

Was she making the right decision? It might be too soon for Sylia to 
tell Linna how she felt about her. They had known each other a long 
time, but not in any romantic way. They hadn&#39;t even been friends, 
really, just business associates who worked well together.

It wasn&#39;t until the past few weeks that she had really seen how good a 
friend Linna could be. A kind, supportive presence who was there when 
she needed her, ready to share laughter and tears as needed. And this 
morning...

Sylia hadn&#39;t considered how intimate it would be, sleeping in her bed 
with Linna. She had awakened fuzzily, felt the soft warmth of a body 
spooned against her own, and opened her eyes to gaze at Linna&#39;s 
sleeping face. Her head was resting on Sylia&#39;s arm, trapping her 
there.

For the next half hour she had watched Linna, smiling a bit in her 
sleep. Finally, Linna had rolled over, freeing Sylia, but she stayed 
there a little while longer by Linna&#39;s side. Sylia had never fully 
realized how beautiful Linna really was.

Sylia smiled. She would tell Linna tonight, and then she would just 
see what happens. She would never again love silently, and risk 
loosing that love to someone else.



Standing outside the Rose restaurant, Linna turned at the sound of a 
delicate clearing of the throat, and then nearly gasped aloud at what 
she saw there. Sylia wore a pearl gray suit, tailored to show off her 
curves, while still being comfortable and chic. She really did look 
like the owner of a fashionable store, not the severe businesswoman 
look she usually maintained.

&quot;It seems we both picked out our armor colors,&quot; Sylia said to Linna 
quietly, a small smile on her face. &quot;You look lovely,&quot; Sylia 
continued.

&quot;You look great,&quot; a tongue-tied Linna managed to get out. &#39;Why hadn&#39;t 
she noticed how handsome Sylia could be?&#39; she wondered. Sylia stepped 
closer to Linna and offered her arm, she reflexedly look it, and they 
made their way into the restaurant together. &quot;Have you ever eaten at 
this place before?&quot; Linna asked, then cursed herself at asking such a 
dumb question.

&quot;A business colleague, Arisugawa Juri, recommended it. I tried it once 
and really enjoyed the variety of dishes,&quot; Sylia calmly explained. She 
wasn&#39;t wearing perfume, thankfully, as Linna didn&#39;t think she could 
stand any more stimulus. But she did have a distinctive scent, a faint 
mix of oil, grease and her shampoo that Linna found comfortingly 
familiar.

The waitress smiled at the two of them, and instead of taking them to 
their regular seat, she brought them to a cozy, corner table. &quot;Your 
reserved table, Ms. Stingray,&quot; the young woman said cheerfully. &quot;I 
hope you and your date both enjoy your dinner.&quot;

Sylia blushed a bit at Linna&#39;s smile and raised eyebrow. &quot;I reserved 
under Sylia Stingray and companion,&quot; she explained to her hurriedly, 
&quot;I guess they must have jumped to that conclusion.&quot; Sylia looked 
nervously across at Linna, &quot;That doesn&#39;t bother you, does it?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Linna answered, blushing faintly. She smiled a bit, &quot;As long as 
you don&#39;t mind being paired with someone as average as me.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re in no way average,&quot; Sylia protested softly, &quot;and I&#39;d be 
honored to be paired with someone as extraordinary as you.&quot; They 
looked silently at each other, Linna mildly surprised, and Sylia a bit 
stunned by her own frankness. &quot;I&#39;m making a mess of this,&quot; Sylia 
admitted softly, blushing a bit under Linna&#39;s gaze.

&quot;No, I&#39;m loving it,&quot; Linna said, and gently lay her own hand over 
Sylia&#39;s. &quot;I&#39;m just a bit surprised, that&#39;s all. You&#39;re normally so 
reserved...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been trying not to be,&quot; Sylia confessed. She took a deep breath, 
&quot;I asked you here to explain why I was so hard on you, for a while 
there.&quot;

&quot;You lost someone you loved,&quot; Linna said to her softly, making it more 
of a question. She held her breath, waiting for an answer.

&quot;Someone I never had, really.&quot; Sylia continued softly, &quot;I never showed 
it, or told her how I felt, and eventually I lost my chance.&quot;

Linna really, really didn&#39;t want to ask Sylia the next question, but 
some part of her must have felt it had to, &quot;Was it Priss, Sylia?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sylia admitted, and took a sip of her drink. &quot;I think it was 
more of a crush,. looking back on it, but it sure hurt when I 
discovered she had someone else.&quot;

&quot;So am I some kind of consolation prize, then, a second best instead 
of her?&quot; Linna asked with a bit of bitterness in her voice.

&quot;No!&quot; Sylia exclaimed, and wrapped her hands around Linna&#39;s. Linna was 
more than a bit surprised to see the glimmer of tears in Sylia&#39;s eyes 
as she said &quot;I didn&#39;t want to tell you about Priss, Linna. I was 
scared you would feel this way, but I won&#39;t lie to you, either.&quot;

Linna let out a little puff of breath. &quot;I think I believe you,&quot; she 
admitted to her softly. Before she could say anymore, a waitress 
arrived with their plates of food.

She smiled at them cheerfully as she served up their plates, and then 
said &quot;I hope you enjoy your meal. We also have rooms available for the 
night if you wish to extend your romantic evening.&quot; With that, she 
winked saucily at them, and left.

Sylia couldn&#39;t have looked more embarrassed if she tried. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
I didn&#39;t know,&quot; she started to say, only to have Linna break out into 
a fit of giggles. Sylia looked at her blankly a moment, then began to 
laugh softly as well.

&quot;If we keep this up,&quot; Linna managed to get out, &quot;we&#39;ll be in trouble 
for public drunkenness, or something.&quot; They both managed to regain a 
straight face, though the odd looks the waitresses were giving them 
really didn&#39;t help.

&quot;Linna,&quot; Sylia said to her softly after a few minutes of eating, &quot;I 
think I&#39;ve managed to fall for you.&quot; She smiled wryly at Linna&#39;s 
obvious expression of surprise, &quot;I&#39;m not holding things back as much, 
anymore.&quot;

&quot;I have to admit I&#39;ve been thinking of you in...&quot; Linna blushed as she 
added shyly, &quot;that way.&quot; She looked obviously torn as she continued, 
&quot;But I&#39;ve never been attracted to a woman before, Sylia. What if this 
is just a crush? I don&#39;t want to hurt you, too.&quot;

&quot;Lets find out, then&quot; Sylia suggested to her gently. &quot;It could be I 
may be rushing you a bit,&quot; she admitted, &quot;so why don&#39;t we try and date 
first?&quot; She smiled over at Linna, &quot;I don&#39;t want to loose this 
connection we&#39;ve discovered.&quot;

&quot;Go out together, you mean,&quot; Linna said softly, gazing into Sylia&#39;s 
dark eyes. She had never noticed before how much they were like dark 
pools, deep pools that one could almost drown in if you weren&#39;t 
careful.

&quot;Yeah, go out together, have fun, and get to know each other better,&quot; 
Sylia agreed, trying not to look down Linna&#39;s dress as she bent toward 
her. It had taken a lot of will power for Sylia not to take advantage 
of Linna last night, a noble act she was sort of regretting now.

&quot;Do things like mini-golf, walk together&quot; Linna said weakly. The 
memory of Sylia in her nightie this morning was seared into her mind, 
and was rampaging across her memory, triggering all kinds of responses 
in her body.

&quot;I have a better idea,&quot; Linna said to her firmly, and pulled Sylia 
over the table into a fiercely demanding kiss. &quot;Why don&#39;t we rent one 
of those rooms for the night?&quot; Linna asked Sylia in a husky voice, her 
eyes sultry.

Sylia visibly gulped, looking a little bit afraid of what she may have 
unleashed here. &quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot; she heard herself 
ask, almost against her will. &#39;What am I saying,&#39; she thought to 
herself.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Linna said softly. She grinned, &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to since I saw 
you in that sheer nightie this morning,&quot; she said with a smile. They 
finished their dinner in undue haste, and quickly tracked down the 
impishly smiling waitress.

A quick credit transaction later, and Sylia and Linna found themselves 
in front of their suite, keys in hand. &quot;Last chance to turn around,&quot; 
Sylia said to Linna gently. She wanted her, Sylia had to admit it to 
herself, but she didn&#39;t want Linna to regret what she was doing 
tonight.

&quot;Since when have Knight Sabers ever turned from danger?&quot; Linna asked 
her with an sexy smile, and quickly unlocked the door. They stepped 
inside together, the door swinging closed right behind them.

A amused voice can just barely be heard behind the closed door, 
&quot;Sylia, I wore the lingerie you gave me this morning, just in case.&quot;

&quot;So did I,&quot; and chuckles...
