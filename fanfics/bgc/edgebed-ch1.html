<h1>On the Edge of the Bed</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ginko.html">Ginko</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Linna awoke with a terrible, throbbing headache - only dimly
aware that she wasn&#39;t lying in her own bed.  She sat up slowly, but it
still sent a stabbing pain through her head.  The sunlight filtering
in from the room&#39;s one window wasn&#39;t helping matters either.

Linna couldn&#39;t repress a quiet sigh as she realized she wasn&#39;t
wearing anything.  She already had an idea of what had happened so she 
turned to her right to see who it had happened with.  Linna&#39;s heart
leapt into her throat.  Sleeping serenely beside her was her team-mate,
Priss.
 
Through the fog of her hangover, Linna started to piece together
the events that had brought her here.

There had been a party the night before - she remembered that
much at least.  It had been a celebration that Galatea had been defeated
and that all of the Knight Sabers had returned safely from their suicide
mission.  It was a good reason to live things up a little, but Linna had
over done it a bit with the drinking.  She could tear the core out of a
one ton boomer but any more than two or three drinks put her on her ass.
Still, she wished she could at least remember if she had come onto Priss
or if it had been the other way around.  It was probably the prior,
Linna decided.

She had always had strong feelings for Priss but Linna hadn&#39;t
really thought they were &quot;those&quot; kinds of feelings.  Was she in love
with Priss?  Linna had certainly looked up to her and had come to depend
on her.  They had saved each other&#39;s lives so many times it would have
been strange if they hadn&#39;t been close to each other.

No, thinking back on things Linna had to admit it was more than
that.  When she had returned home to Kumamoto for her parent&#39;s little
arranged date she had been thinking of Priss the whole time and later,
when Nene had hinted that Priss might have been interested in Leon, 
Linna had been jealous, though she hadn&#39;t really admitted it to herself.

Looking at the woman sleeping beside her, Linna felt an ache in
her heart as she realized she wanted to do nothing more than curl up
next to her and stay there forever.  Things are never that easy, though,
Linna thought.  Priss had probably been just as drunk as she had been.
There was no telling what Priss would think when she woke up and found
herself in bed with Linna.  There was a very real chance that this could
ruin the best friendship Linna had ever known.

&quot;What have I done?&quot; she whispered softly to herself.

Actually, Linna thought the better question might be, what was
she going to do now.

At the risk of further aggravating her throbbing head, Linna
moved to sit on the edge of the bed with her back towards Priss.
Looking at her lying there naked was too much right now.  As Linna
picked her shirt up from beside the bed and slipped it on she thought
about sneaking out of Priss&#39;s trailer and hoping that Priss had enough
to drink that she wouldn&#39;t remember their night together.  There was
always the chance that Priss would remember at least some of what had
happened, but if Linna never mentioned anything about it she doubted
that Priss would bring it up either.  For just a moment Linna was
hopeful that the friendship she had shared with Priss could continue
the way it had before.  If she could just be a Knight Saber and fight
beside Priss, that would be enough.  She would cherish that.

At that moment, Linna felt a single finger tracing her spine
and gave a startled cry.

&quot;You startled me!&quot; Linna said as she turned to the woman lying
next to her.

&quot;You surprised me too, last night,&quot; Priss replied with a smirk.

Linna could feel the heat as blood rushed into her cheeks and
she chastised herself for blushing.  She had to keep her cool.

&quot;So, you remember last night, I take it,&quot; Linna inquired, trying
to keep her voice from shaking.

Priss simply nodded. She was unreadable.

Linna could feel the tears starting to well up in her eyes, &quot;Do
you want to talk about it?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s nothing to talk about,&quot; Priss stated simply, &quot;I know
everything I need to know.&quot;

She was looking at Linna the same way she had when they first
met.  Then, to Linna&#39;s surprise, Priss leaned into her and kissed her.
Linna forgot about her headache and all of her worries at that moment
and all that mattered was just being there with the woman she loved.</pre>
