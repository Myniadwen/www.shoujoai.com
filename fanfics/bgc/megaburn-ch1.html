<h1>Megatokyo Burning (part 1 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Prelude

        Most people have heard alot about it, of course, the battle for 
the city of Megatokyo and in a very real way for the heart of Japan. But 
most people only know the outline, not any of the details. I guess 
that&#39;s why you&#39;re here now, right?

        With a story that&#39;s as big as this one is, they say you should 
start at the beginning. But where, exactly, is that supposed to be? 
Especially when you take into account some of the people that we&#39;re 
dealing with here?

        Should I start off with the fall of a ancient civilization on 
the Moon, the survivors flung through space and time into another era? 
In modern times they took up arms against the forces of darkness, 
protecting all of humanity as the legendary sailor soldiers of love and 
justice along with the people who would come to love them.

        But still, it&#39;s not just their story, and those details don&#39;t 
really help us tell the tale.

        Once upon a time, long, long ago a noble Prince fell from grace, 
pulling his Princess sister down with him. Seeking to regain his lost 
power he manipulated a group of heroic young people to become Duelists, 
and one of them proved to be a greater prince than he ever was, saving 
the Princess and freeing them all.

        They all became involved, too.

        As old as humanity itself, or maybe even much older, the beings 
called Goddesses and Demons watched over humanity, answering our calls 
and then granting us wishes both noble and dark as they competed 
fiercely for our very hearts and souls. They even came to Tokyo itself, 
changing things in ways we&#39;re all still dealing with.

        Their actions were part of our tale too, but still...

        Then there&#39;s the AD Police, at that time the only police force 
that really mattered much in the city. Having evolved beyond simply 
dealing with Boomer crimes, the Advanced Police worked all forms of 
cutting edge crimes, and were the first to begin to see that something 
was going on.

        But they weren&#39;t enough to stop it, not on their own.

        The staff of a private bar, some of the oddest women that you 
would ever think to meet, played a role, too. They took up arms to 
defend their home, to protect people they considered to be their 
friends... And to avenge the death of one of their own.

        Warriors all.

        But what it really came down to, in the end, was the members of 
the Knight Sabers, the four armored defenders of the city. They were the 
ones who finally ended the battle, ultimately, and one of whom paid the 
greatest price.

        Who am I?

        Oh, I didn&#39;t say, did I?

        My name is Nene Romanova.

        And I was there to see it all.

Introduction Notes: Bubblegum Crisis 2055: Megatokyo Burning

This is a continuation of the BGC fanfiction A Goddess Comes to Call, 
and set in the same continuity as the Arisugawa&#39;s Locket/ Eternal City 
Crystal Tokyo series. While knowledge of these fics will be useful, it 
won&#39;t be required, hopefully. Chapter one of this series will go up soon 
after the end of my BGC: Mecha Wars crossover.

----------

Part One

        The AD Police headquarters was bustling with people as the older 
woman walked along the hallway. Her blonde hair fell into her eyes, 
nearly covering up her round glasses. The uniform was crisp, the 
insignia of a lieutenant on her collar, but she still stopped to check 
her overcoat. The thirty something year old woman hit the buzzer, 
waiting until she heard a reply.

        &quot;Come in,&quot; the voice yelled, and she went inside. The brown 
haired man sat behind the desk, studying the paperwork intently. Leon 
McNicol looked up as she came in and offered a smile, &quot;Hey, Nene. You 
got the electronic crimes reports?&quot;

        Nene Romanova nodded slightly, adding with a sweet little smile, 
&quot;I had the boys over at the division dumb it down, boss, just for you.&quot;

        &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Leon sighed, the light catching traces of gray in 
his shaggy mop of hair. He looked over the file she handed him while 
muttering, &quot;I knew I should have turned down the Chief position, Daley 
could be sitting here right now..&quot;

        &quot;You know Daley makes a better second in command, it suits him,&quot; 
Nene shrugged. &quot;There&#39;s one thing that concerns me,&quot; she said seriously, 
the head of electronic crimes leaning on the side of the desk, &quot;the 
increase of corporate espionage.&quot;

        &quot;Huh,&quot; Leon flipped ahead, &quot;no, not good.&quot; He looked up at Nene 
thoughtfully, &quot;I don&#39;t recall many being reported to us, though. Your 
crackers being busy again?&quot;

        &quot;Something like that,&quot; Nene agreed good naturedly. She raised an 
eyebrow, &quot;You want me to tell them to stop?&quot;

        &quot;Hell no!&quot; Leon sat up, &quot;They&#39;re probably the only early warning 
system we&#39;ve got.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll pass that on,&quot; Nene gave him a smile, &quot;my boys and girls 
will like hearing that.&quot;

        &quot;They&#39;ve earned it,&quot; Leon said firmly, &quot;we wouldn&#39;t have heard 
about those death cult nuts in time to stop them without them.&quot;

        A bit more seriously Nene asked, &quot;Where did things go wrong? I 
always thought taking out Genom would help Megatokyo.&quot;

        &quot;Cause Genom wasn&#39;t the only bad apple,&quot; Leon sighed, &quot;just the 
biggest and toughest of them. Once they got out of the dirt, a dozen 
more companies stepped in.&quot; He made a face, &quot;There are days that I wish 
we could put a Knight Sabers signal on the roof.&quot;

        Nene smirked at that mental image. &quot;You know that the Knight 
Sabers are all just an urban myth,&quot; she said mock seriously.

        &quot;City hall might want to sell crap like that,&quot; Leon said with a 
slight smile, &quot;but most of the city knows better, including you and me.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll have my people keeping an eye on the companies involved 
with the espionage,&quot; Nene said thoughtfully, &quot;try to see if their is any 
escalation.&quot;

        &quot;Not that we&#39;ll be able to do much,&quot; Leon made a face. &quot;Too many 
of the companies have way too much pull with the powers that be.&quot;

        &quot;Then we pass on the data to those who can do something,&quot; Nene 
said firmly. She gave him a grim little smile, &quot;I&#39;d better get back to 
work.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; and Leon went back to his paperwork.

        Nene strode down the hall to her own executive level office, 
taking a seat behind the large desk. She activated the phone, selecting 
a specially secured line before making the connection. In seconds a 
beautiful, silver haired face appeared in the screen and Nene said 
crisply, &quot;I&#39;d like to get the others together for a meeting.&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Sylia Stingray narrowed her eyes, assessing the 
woman&#39;s mood. &quot;What time?&quot; she asked her crisply.

        &quot;As soon as we can manage, ideally,&quot; Nene ran a hand through her 
hair, &quot;I don&#39;t like the looks of some of the information we&#39;ve got.&quot;

        Sylia quickly consulted a terminal set beside her seat before 
reporting, &quot;Tomorrow night is the best I can do, I think.&quot;

        &quot;See you then,&quot; Nene gave her a smile as they disconnected.

        With a soft sigh Nene sat back in her chair, fighting back a 
little stab of jealousy. Sylia had looked like she was barely in her 
twenties... &#39;Why were the others so lucky?&#39; she wondered, &#39;Why are they 
all still so young?&#39;

        Nene rubbed her face with her hands. She knew why, more or less. 
Nearly fifteen years ago the Knight Sabers had encountered the three 
Goddesses, when Linna had accidentally called down Belldandy. Urd, Skuld 
and the demon Mara had soon followed her into their lives, and they 
became caught up in a plot by Genom to control the supernatural. When 
the dust settled Quincy was dead, and several Goddesses were living with 
members of the team.

        In the aftermath a hostile takeover of Genom occurred by a 
powerful if little known company called Whirlwind engineering. Under the 
new management Genom became a much more ethical, even principled 
organization, with many of the crooked employees being removed. But in 
that power vacuum other, less scrupulous organizations moved in, all 
competing for the same thing. And creating a whole new series of 
problems for the AD Police.

        Nene sighed softly, abandoning her reflection on the past. &quot;I 
always knew that I should have hooked up with Skuld,&quot; she muttered 
mockingly as she went back to her own work.

        &quot;Hey, boss,&quot; Lisa stuck her head in with a smile.

        &quot;Lisa,&quot; Nene nodded to the officer who was theoretically her 
secretary. In reality Lisa Valente was as good a hacker as any of her 
people, and could have been a real terror if she wanted to be. &quot;So 
what&#39;s up?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;I was going for lunch, thought I&#39;d check if you wanted any,&quot; 
Lisa smiled. The African descended woman hesitated, &quot;What did Chief 
McNicol think of the report?&quot;

        &quot;Leon asked me to pass on his thanks,&quot; Nene smiled, &quot;he&#39;s 
impressed.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll tell the others,&quot; Lisa said with a smile at the 
compliment. A bit more seriously, &quot;What are we going to do about it?&quot;

        &quot;Keep an eye on it for now,&quot; Nene sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t like the 
looks of this, but nobody&#39;s reported any crimes yet. Until they do, we 
can&#39;t do anything about it.&quot;

        &quot;Got it,&quot; Lisa headed out without the usual spring to her step.

        Not that Nene could blame her for that, really. It could be so 
frustrating, knowing that crimes were being committed but not being able 
to do anything about it. Even in her role as a member of the Knight 
Sabers Nene was faced with those sort of situations, and it was even 
more frustrating as an officer with the AD Police.

        Her phone chimed, and Nene reached over to answer it. Her gave 
expression relaxed into a smile as she looked at her husband, &quot;Hey, 
Mackie.&quot;

        &quot;Nene,&quot; the black haired man beamed. He looked about twenty, 
this humanoid boomer, though in reality he was closer to forty. &quot;What do 
you want for dinner?&quot; he asked.

        &quot;Surprise me,&quot; Nene sighed.

        &quot;Rough day at work?&quot; Mackie said sympathetically. He grinned 
suddenly, &quot;There&#39;s going to be chocolate on the menu tonight, love.&quot;

        &quot;You can&#39;t solve all my problems with chocolate, honey,&quot; Nene 
shook her head with a smile.

        Mackie shrugged, &quot;Maybe not, but it doesn&#39;t hurt. You think 
you&#39;ll be home on time?&quot;

        Nene checked her watch, then looked at the paperwork on her 
desk. &#39;What the hell,&#39; she thought before saying aloud, &quot;I&#39;m heading 
home now, be there in half an hour.&quot;

        &quot;See you soon,&quot; Mackie waved before his image disappeared.</pre>
