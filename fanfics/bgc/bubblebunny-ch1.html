<h1>Bubblegum Bunny</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bgc/index.html">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Priss Asagiri looked at the other women, her brown
hair falling into her eyes a bit. &quot;You have GOT to be
joking,&quot; she said flatly, the biker leaning up against
the wall in her tight set of black riding leathers.

&quot;Why would I joke?&quot; Sylia Stingray asked, the black
haired business woman meeting their eyes calmly.

&quot;But...&quot; Nene Romanova blinked, &quot;bunny suits?&quot;

&quot;I need models for the next Silky Doll fashion show,&quot;
Sylia&#39;s eyes twinkled a bit, &quot;and since I thought you
could use some extra cash...&quot;

&quot;No was in hell,&quot; Priss said flatly.

&quot;How much cash?&quot; Linna Yamazaki asked, the brown
haired fitness instructor looking at Sylia
thoughtfully.

Sylia smiled wickedly as she saw Priss going for the
door, &quot;As much as one of our Knight Saber missions.&quot;

&quot;Seriously?&quot; Priss stopped in the doorway.

&quot;I&#39;ve had some disturbing hints of possible trouble,&quot;
Sylia said calmly, &quot;it&#39;s part of why I&#39;m asking you to
do this.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Nene hesitated, &quot;if it&#39;s Knight Saber
business, I guess we could do it.&quot;

&quot;For that kind of money, I&#39;m in,&quot; Linna agreed with a
nod.

&quot;Priss?&quot; Sylia asked after a moment.

Priss seemed to be gritting her teeth as she
calculated exactly how short she might be this month.
&quot;All right,&quot; she growled, &quot;I&#39;ll go it.&quot;

&quot;Oh good,&quot; Sylia clapped her hands briskly as she
said, &quot;I&#39;ll see you bright and early tomorrow
morning.&quot;

&quot;Early,&quot; Priss grumbled as she stalked out, Linna and
Nene soon following.

Mackey Stingray entered quietly, the brown haired boy
looking at his older sister. &quot;There isn&#39;t any threats,
are there?&quot; he blinked.

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Sylia smirked.

&quot;So why are you...?&quot; Mackey asked as she lead the way
out of the room.

Sylia walked them into a room, the table there covered
with samples. Picking up a lacy number she said, &quot;I
just want to see them in these.&quot;

&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Mackey whimpered, quickly cupping his hands
beneath his nose to try and catch the nosebleed.

The next day certain people began to arrive at the
Silky doll, each summoned by exclusive invitations.
Reika Chang nodded respectfully to Sylia as the
reddish brown haired singer said, &quot;Thank you for the
invitation.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Sylia purred, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll see
something you&#39;ll like.&quot;

Reika smiled slightly, &quot;I hope so.&quot;

As Reika entered the Silky Doll a cloaked figure
walked up to Sylia, the oddly old fashioned garment
concealing her face. &quot;Are you sure we should...?&quot; the
woman asked.

&quot;I wanted to tell Priss earlier,&quot; Sylia held the door
open for her, &quot;but there never seemed to be a right
time.&quot;

&quot;I hope it&#39;s not too much of a shock,&quot; the woman
fretted as Sylia waved her in.

&quot;I think Priss should be too distracted by her
outfit,&quot; Sylia sounded amused, watching a scooter
drive up.

&quot;I&#39;m not late am I?&quot; the blonde haired, dusky skinned
girl asked as she hurried up.

&quot;Just in time, Lisa,&quot; Sylia nodded hello. &quot;It&#39;ll still
be a few minutes till the show begins.&quot;

Lisa Valente smiled, the younger women looking like a
grade schooler, not a university grad. &quot;I can&#39;t wait,&quot;
she said as she rushed in.

A car came to a stop then the elegant business woman
emerged. &quot;Miss Stingray,&quot; Madigan nodded, her Irish
accent providing a charming lilt to her voice.

&quot;Madigan,&quot; Sylia kissed her cheek, &quot;just in time. You
ready for the show?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m more looking forward to spending time with you
afterwards,&quot; Madigan purred, her hand resting on
Sylia&#39;s hip.

&quot;Mackey,&quot; Sylia turned as her little brother arrived,
&quot;can you greet the rest of the ladies? I need to check
on the girls.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Mackey nodded, his black suit making him look
a bit like a waiter.

Sylia strode through the building past the displays
then into the back room where the clothes awaited.
&quot;How&#39;s everything going?&quot; she asked with a false sort
of brightness.

&quot;Sylia,&quot; Priss turned, the black bunny ears she was
wearing matching the skimpy blue lingerie she was
wearing, &quot;what IS this?&quot;

&quot;Did I forget to mention it&#39;s a lingerie show?&quot; Sylia
blinked innocently.

&quot;I can&#39;t wear this,&quot; Nene squeaked, the smaller woman
nervously adjusting the straps of her nearly
transparent pink teddy as her bunny ears flopped
cutely.

Sylia handed over the matching bra and panties from
the clothing rack as she said, &quot;These should help.&quot;

&quot;Not by much,&quot; a blushing Nene pulled them on.

&quot;You&#39;re taking this awfully calmly,&quot; Sylia looked at
Linna.

Linna shrugged, her pert breasts snugly held by the
bustier she had on, her matching green bunny ears
standing up cutely. &quot;It&#39;s about as revealing as some
of the outfits I wear at the gym,&quot; she noted, tugging
at the green cloth.

&quot;If it helps any,&quot; Sylia noted, &quot;I&#39;m going out in
costume too.&quot;

Priss growled deeply in the back of her throat. &quot;I
really wonder if the pay is worth this,&quot; she loudly
grumbled as she pulled a matching set of blue
stockings on then clipped them in place with the
garter belt.

&quot;So, the bunny ears are for Easter?&quot; Nene asked as she
pulled on the pink gloves that went with her costume.

&quot;Got it,&quot; Sylia said as she stripped gracefully,
folding up and setting aside her woman&#39;s suit to
reveal creamy pale flesh. With a unhurried grace she
picked out her lingerie, &quot;And I have a Easter bonus
for each of you too.&quot;

&quot;Nice,&quot; Linna grinned as she finished off her outfit
with a antique green choker.

&quot;Better be a big bonus,&quot; Priss bitched as she tied
back her hair, revealing her shoulders and the base of
her neck.

&quot;I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised,&quot; Sylia
murmured as she dressed in the white lace.

Out in the store Mackey took center stage, adjusting
his tie nervously. &quot;Welcome all to the Silky Doll
exclusive Easter show,&quot; he said, &quot;I hope you&#39;ll enjoy
it all.&quot;

&quot;Ready?&quot; Linna asked as they moved towards the waiting
door.

&quot;No, but do we have a choice?&quot; Priss grumped.

&quot;Just keep reminding yourself how much we&#39;re being
paid,&quot; Nene noted.

&quot;And your bonus,&quot; Sylia smirked, knowing just what was
waiting for them.

Linna strode out first, her steps confident. &quot;First up
is Linna,&quot; Mackey narrated as she strode up to the
guests, &quot;dressed in a elegant french bustier, gloves
and stockings.&quot;

&#145;Oh my god,&#39; Linna&#39;s eyes widened as she saw a certain
face amid a very familiar crowd, &#145;that&#39;s Vision!&#39;

Reika Chang&#39;s eyes were warm with appreciation, her
gaze not leaving Linna as she strode by them, then
back to the change room. &quot;God she&#39;s gorgeous,&quot; Reika
sighed.

&quot;Sylia,&quot; Linna&#39;s voice came out oddly strangled:&quot;what
are you up too?&quot;

&quot;Next up,&quot; Sylia gave Priss a not so delicate shove.

Priss strode out, the frown on her face warring with
the look of her blue bra and panties. &quot;Priss is
wearing out midnight bra and panties.&quot; Mackey said
calmly, his face reddened from the blood rushing to
his cheeks, &quot;along with matching garters in
stockings.&quot;

&#145;Damn that Sylia, what&#39;s she pulling now?&#39; Priss
wondered as she walked up to the watching crowd. The
woman with the cloak met her eye then flipped the
cloak&#39;s hood back, revealing silvery hair and kind
eyes.

This time Priss did stumble, but the woman reached out
to steady her. &quot;Head on back,&quot; Sylvie smiled warmly,
&quot;we&#39;ll talk later.&quot;

&quot;Priss is white as a sheet,&quot; Nene blinked as Priss
returned to the changing room, &quot;Sylia, what are
you...?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re next,&quot; Sylia shooed her out, &quot;knock &#145;em dead!&quot;

&quot;And now Nene is modeling...&quot; Mackey started.

&quot;Whoot!&quot; a woman cheered, &quot;Go Nene!&quot;

&quot;Lisa?!&quot; Nene blurted, suddenly wishing she could
cover herself as she saw the younger woman sitting in
the front row.

Lisa was grinning as she watched Nene, &quot;You look a lot
sexier in that than your uniform.&quot;

Looking out at Nene Sylia smiled, then turned back to
Linna and Priss, &quot;I hope you like your bonuses?&quot; she
waved to the crowd.

&quot;How did you save her?&quot; Priss demanded, looking torn
between hugging Sylia and pounding her one.

&quot;Sylvie was a boomer, no matter how advanced,&quot; Sylia
reminded her, &quot;and I have my father&#39;s data files.
Repairing and reactivating her took some effort on Dr.
Raven and my part, but nothing more than that.&quot;

&quot;And why is Reika here?&quot; Linna demanded.

&quot;I thought you had some unfinished business,&quot; Sylia
smiled.

&quot;True,&quot; Linna conceded.

&quot;You...&quot; a redly blushing Nene staggered back into the
room with them.

Sylia smirked, &quot;You&#39;ve got lipstick on your cheek.&quot;

&quot;Ack,&quot; Nene quickly rubbed it off. &quot;How did you know
Lisa even liked me that way? I didn&#39;t even know!&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t notice?&quot; Linna blinked.

Priss nodded, &quot;I thought it was obvious.&quot;

&quot;Meanies,&quot; Nene pouted.

&quot;Would you all like to earn a bit more money?&quot; Sylia
asked calmly.

&quot;How?&quot; Priss sounded even more wary then normal.

Linna raised a eyebrow, &quot;And is it going to cost us
more dignity?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to give our guests the chance to try on
samples,&quot; Sylia said with a sly smile, &quot;would you like
to help them?&quot;

Priss, Nene and Linna exchanged a single glance,
&quot;We&#39;ll do it!&quot;

End

Notes: A more than slightly OOC original BGC fic for
Easter. :) I continue to believe most of the cast is
bi if not actually gay, so a fic like this kinda makes
sense.
