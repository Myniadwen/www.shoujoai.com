<a href="../vampire/greylove-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>look at the sunrise

The night was ending. The black sky turned purple with dashes of pink, 
blue and orange. Miyu sat on the beach with her arm wrapped around 
Chisato. Chisato&#39;s head rested gently on Miyu&#39;s chest. She said she 
wanted to go to Ibiza so that&#39;s where Miyu took her. The new necklace 
Miyu bought for Chisato was shining heavily against Miyu&#39;s cheek. 

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu whispered tapping her gently on the shoulder. Miyu heard 
a sweet grunt. Chisato&#39;s eyes slowly opened 

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato whispered faintly but was loud enough for Miyu to hear. 
Chisato yawned rubbing her eyes like any body would do as soon as they 
wake up. Chisato moved away from Miyu to look at the sunrise. Then she 
examined the white sand with her fingers. &quot;Miyu where are we?&quot; Chisato 
asked Miyu

&quot;Ibiza&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;You really took me here&quot; Chisato asked in surprise, Chisato never 
thought Miyu would actually take her there at all.

&quot;You wanted to come here didn&#39;t you&quot; Miyu asked. Chisato nodded &quot;So 
that&#39;s what I did.&quot;

&quot;OH MIYU THANK YOU!&quot; Chisato jumped on Miyu giving her a huge hug and a 
kiss on the cheek. Miyu smiled then pushed Chisato into a deep kiss on 
the mouth causing Chisato to open her eyes wider, when Miyu broke the 
kiss she place her hands gracefully on Chisato&#39;s cheeks and turned her 
face gently to the sky.

&quot;Look at the sunrise Chisato&quot; Miyu softly demanded her. Chisato stared 
at the sky it was beautiful. &quot;

It&#39;s beautiful&quot; Chisato replied, &quot;I wish I could wake up to this every 
day&quot; she wished resting her head onto Miyu again. &quot;Miyu, what do you 
wish for?&quot;

That indeed was a good question. Miyu had no answer she had nearly 
everything she actually needed. Miyu slid her fingers through her 
reddish-brown hair &quot;I wish for your cute face to be there when I open my 
eyes&quot;

&quot;Are you serious&quot; Chisato asked sitting on Miyu&#39;s white kimono clads. 
Miyu&#39;s golden eyes roamed into Chisato&#39;s chocolate eyes. &quot;Would I lie to 
you,&quot; Miyu whispered. Chisato said &quot;no&quot; then flicked the dress with her 
hands then Chisato sighed

&quot;You still wear white panties,&quot; Chisato complained 

&quot;Is that question even relevant or appropriate?&quot; Miyu asked her auburn 
lover. &quot;Does it really matter what colour my panties are? They&#39;re only 
going to come off tonight&quot; Miyu crept up behind Chisato kissing her hand 
then resting on Chisato&#39;s shoulder

&quot;What do you plan on doing tonight?&quot; Chisato asked a lustful tone in her 
voice.

&quot;You&#39;ll have to wait and find out,&quot; Miyu announced nibbling Chisato&#39;s 
ear the sounds. Chisato felt shivers down her spine the sensations 
nearly made her giggle. 

&quot;So any shinma to hunt yet?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Miyu, asked, &quot;I better have to plan our time carefully 
so I can have more time with you&quot;

That Evening Miyu returned from dealing with a shinma she looked hot 
bothered and stressed.

Chisato was walking around the room in her corset and fish net tights. 
Chisato rested on the silky bed. Miyu dropped onto Chisato. &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong Miyu&quot;?

&quot;Holy shit!&quot; Miyu hissed, &quot;this shinma was like taking the piss outta 
me&quot; she stood up removing her ribbon from her hair then shaking her hair 
outta her face &quot; Mocking Larva god it really pisses me when people do 
that to him&quot;

&quot;How were they taking the piss outta you two&quot; Chisato asked. Miyu fell 
next to Chisato on the bed. 

&quot;Fucking hell, they called me a whore, lesbian vampire a love rat I was 
so angry I killed them off with my flames&quot;

&quot;Ya think Larva noticed your anger?&quot; Chisato asked 

&quot;I think so&quot; Miyu replied, &quot;He&#39;s like the only one who understands me. I 
can&#39;t trick him&quot;    

&quot;Well cheer up&quot; Chisato demanded &quot;You&#39;re with me now&quot; Chisato stroked 
her cheek &quot;you have me now and still waiting for what you wanted to do 
tonight&quot;

&quot;Let me just take my clothes off&quot; Miyu panted

&quot;No let me&quot;

Miyu said no more. Chisato untied the ribbon with difficulty but 
eventually the purple ribbons slid through her fingers. Letting all her 
clothes slip off her. Chisato reached for Miyu&#39;s white panties. &quot;Finally 
I can take this off&quot; Chisato slowly removed the panties that annoyed her 
so much. 

Miyu looked at the departed clothes, she felt her body being controlled 
by Chisato. Miyu in return reached for Chisato&#39;s back then slid the zip 
of the corset fell apart then the corset fell on Miyu&#39;s back. They both 
quickly shrugged it off. 

Miyu reached for the purple ribbon. Miyu wrapped Chisato&#39;s naked body 
with her purple ribbon. Chisato stood there giggling the laughs became 
the centre of Miyu&#39;s attention.  

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Miyu asked as she wrapped the final part of the 
ribbon on to Chisato&#39;s neck.

&quot;It tickles&quot; Chisato giggled. 

&quot;Honestly Chisato,&quot; Miyu moaned, &quot;You&#39;re worse than Shiina&quot; Miyu then 
held a grip tight on her ribbon which was now wrapped around Chisato&#39;s 
hand 

&quot;What do you want me to do?&quot; Chisato asked with a blush covering her 
entire cheek

&quot;Spin around&quot; Miyu told her.

&quot;Like that scene in &#39;Shakespeare in love&#39;&quot; Chisato asked but she still 
spun around the force was too quick for Chisato and she spun her way to 
the ground. Miyu smirked.

&quot;Is that all you can do&quot; Chisato said as she got off the ground and 
faced Miyu  &quot;I fall over and all you can do is stand there and smile&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; Miyu replied, &quot;What did you expect me to do?&quot;

&quot;Kiss me&quot; Chisato replied

Miyu first went into the drawers and got out a whip the designs of the 
whip handle where off a serpent painted with emeralds. Miyu had it in 
her hand then crawled over to Chisato and pulled her into a deep intense 
kiss. Their bodies felt the heat wave as they shared sweat and saliva 
they gracefully fell on the bed stroking eachother&#39;s bodies the volume 
of the breathing increased and the comedy had transformed into an 
intense momement. Their tongues dancing one momement fighting the next 
at one point, Miyu accidentally bit Chisato&#39;s tongue 

The kiss slowly and reluctantly ended. Their bodies must be above the 
average human temperature, which was 37 degrees they felt like they were 
at boiling point already.  

Chisato saw Miyu&#39;s hand reach for the whip Chisato intercepted Miyu then 
squeezed it tightly then rolled on top of her.

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing&quot; Chisato asked in a cold voice but in a 
lusting face

&quot;What wrong Chis?&quot; Miyu ogled back &quot;I can&#39;t touch it&quot;

&quot;Not yet&quot; Chisato asked returning her cute face &quot;It&#39;s pay back time. 
I&#39;ve always wanted to whip you Mi-Mi&quot; Chisato rubbing her nose on Miyu, 
for some reason rubbing eachother on the nose wasn&#39;t enough she dragged 
Chisato&#39;s face to hr lips and kissed her. 

After the kiss Chisato rolled Miyu over then Chisato sat near Miyu&#39;s 
feet. Chisato raised her whip up slightly hurting her own back. She 
dropped it on Miyu hearing the sharp movements and feeling the sharp 
pain. It felt like an electrical shock. Chisato continued whipping Miyu. 
The sharp sudden shocks to Miyu&#39;s system of sheer pain slowly became a 
wave of sheer pleasure. 

Miyu slid of the bed this distracted Chisato and ruined her 
concentration then she accidentally whipped herself on the back causing 
her to collapse of the bed. 

Chisato got up like an old lady then reached to the bed rubbing her self 
&quot;That hurts&quot; she complained. 

&quot;Well you shouldn&#39;t be whipping your self then&quot; Miyu replied as she got 
back on the bed with Chisato.

&quot;Oh well if some vampire hadn&#39;t off slipped off the bed&quot;

&quot;I was in pain&quot;

&quot;Excuses, excuses, excuses, excuses, excuses&quot; Chisato giggled placing 
her palm in between Miyu&#39;s breasts, spreading her fingers out then 
reached over and kissed Miyu. Miyu felt the warm blush on Chisato&#39;s 
cheek it encouraged her cheeks to glow red also.

Miyu&#39;s finger trembled down to Chisato&#39;s body looking for the private 
area when she found it she examined the wetness and softness. She then 
placed more fingers in the private area. Chisato felt it in her she 
closed her eyes tight as she fell on Miyu&#39;s neck.   

Miyu twisted Chisato&#39;s auburn hair with her finger. The pitch of the 
breathing increased. The energy followed the shivers down their spines 
and just as you thought the heat couldn&#39;t get any hotter a heat wave 
swirls them both together. Only one colour could be used to describe the 
situation. Red.

Red for anger
Red for passion
Red for desperation
Red for love
Red for heat
Red for sex
Red for emotion
Red for their blushing cheeks

Their bodies imploded together rolling on top of eachother on the bed 
about five times. The pitch of the breathing lowered slightly. Chisato&#39;s 
mouth was wide open tilting her head whilst Miyu rested her head on 
Chisato&#39;s breasts. Eventually placed her mouth on one of them whilst 
rubbing the other. Chisato gazed at her whilst she played with Miyu&#39;s 
hair feeling the dark but soft brunette&#39;s hair.   

They both gasped in unison with equal pitches. Miyu stopped to face her 
in one quick motion was a tight hug with foreheads close together like 
magnets. The breathing volume increased again. Miyu&#39;s pitch was very low 
whilst Chisato&#39;s was very high. The sensations started again while they 
kissed again their tongues behaving in a hyper manner. As soon as the 
kiss broke Miyu got up. Chisato slid down to Miyu&#39;s entrance and licked 
her clit. Miyu tilted her head backwards feeling the tongue move up then 
down. Breathing heavily Miyu&#39;s breathing pitch slowly became higher. 
Miyu found losing control of her actions feeling almost human. 

Chisato enjoyed Miyu&#39;s taste she felt Miyu&#39;s timid legs shiver although 
they were baking hot. Miyu pulled Chisato into another intense kiss 
getting the mix of saliva and her own cum. Chisato reached for her left 
breast and sucked on it. Miyu silently whispered her name as she wrapped 
her right leg around Chisato&#39;s waist. Miyu felt fingers in her passage 
Miyu now used both her arms to examine Chisato&#39;s beige back. Miyu 
gasping rapidly feeling that she was going to receive an orgasm. Miyu 
still in absolute pleasure her face grew red from blushing. Miyu felt 
Chisato remove her hand from her clit and moved to the other bosom. This 
gave Miyu a chance to get up and Miyu&#39;s hands departed Chisato&#39;s back 
and melted in Chisato&#39;s reddish brown hair, then the fingers slided down 
her cheeks Miyu called out Chisato&#39;s name. The forgotten pain was 
clouded in forbidden pleasure. Chisato felt she could explode from all 
this love she was so tired she fell onto Miyu. 

Miyu heard her heavy breathing the breathing was so hard Miyu even felt 
it on her it was slightly waving her hair. Miyu calmed Chisato down with 
a light kiss. Chisato&#39;s breathing returned to neutral Chisato closed her 
eyes and rested her head on Miyu&#39;s chest and wrapped her arms around 
Miyu&#39;s neck.

&quot;I love you Miyu&quot; Chisato whispered Miyu stroked Chisato in a motherly 
manner and replied

&quot;I love you too&quot;

Miyu looked at Chisato who was sleeping peacefully she reflected on how 
cute Chisato was in that kind of pose Chisato looked so dazed and 
confused. Miyu was checking weather Chisato was asleep or just resting 
her eyes.  When Chisato fell asleep in Miyu&#39;s arms, Miyu kissed Chisato 
on the cheek then wrapped her naked body in the silky covers. Miyu 
watched Chisato sleep and joined her in the sheets holding her hand 
gracefully wishing to travel with her in her dreams.  Before Miyu 
herself falling to sleep she kissed her hand and closed her eyes. Miyu 
never felt so happy or fearless now she had resurrected Chisato. Miyu 
had herself thinking why she never confessed her feelings. After years 
of solitude and heartbreak she finally found someone to live for. She no 
longer felt a burden to Larva and would be pleased to have Chisato as a 
burden.
