<h1>You Are So Weird</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../vampire/index.html">Vampire Princess Miyu</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Miyu turned her head both ways to make sure Larva wasn&#39;t there whilst 
she was holding Chisato in her arms. Miyu laid Chisato on the bed 
peacefully stroking her reddish brown hair. 

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu said peacefully &quot;wake up, wake up&quot;

The girl woke up slowly then as soon as she opened her eyes closed them 
again.

&quot;Miyu?&quot; Chisato asked faintly &quot;Is that you?&quot; 

&quot;Yes it is&quot; Miyu replied running her fingers through her auburn hair 
Miyu felt a sudden awkward feeling about things. Things were going in 
her mind was be how Larva would react to it. All she knew that he would 
react very negatively and feel that all the long years of his service 
had been thrown back at him in the face. But Larva was no longer the 
most important person to her anymore Chisato was.

&quot;You know I wouldn&#39;t do those things in freewill don&#39;t you Miyu&quot; Chisato 
replied

&quot;I am aware of that,&quot; Miyu said with a smile she didn&#39;t care if Chisato 
had her eyes shut &quot;but&quot; she added, &quot;I thought the true Chisato died when 
the egg hatched in you&quot; 

&quot;When my brother died&quot; Chisato told Miyu &quot;I was deeply devastated&quot; 
Chisato began stroking Miyu&#39;s breasts wrapped up in the kimono clads. 
&quot;It was then I got possessed and turned into an ultimate killing machine 
and tried to kill you&quot;  

&quot;Would you actually have married your brother?&quot; Miyu asked, as her hand 
grew warm from stroking Chisato&#39;s cheek

&quot;It was my dream when I was little and ended when I was eight&quot; Chisato 
confessed &quot;I used that because I was so upset about my brother being 
dead. I love you Miyu&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re so cute Chisato-chan&quot; Miyu whispered to her slowly the words 
caused Chisato to open her eyes faintly and for her to hold a firm grip 
of Miyu&#39;s white clothes 

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato whispered, &quot;You are so weird&quot; Miyu then stroked her body 

&quot;You think so?&quot; Miyu asked Chisato only nodded slightly then reached 
over for a lips union. Miyu had her arms crossed around Chisato with 
hyper fingers dancing around the back of Chisato&#39;s neck. Miyu felt 
sudden movements on her purple obi, fingers tickling up and down on 
Miyu&#39;s waist. Chisato&#39;s arms reached out for Miyu&#39;s purple ribbon and 
untied it hastily whereas Miyu was loosening up Chisato&#39;s buttons on her 
school dress.

The lips nibbling at eachother slowly turned into a sexual kiss the 
lonely and curious tongues wiggled into eachother&#39;s mouths bumping into 
eachother the tongues greeted by twisting, turning, dancing and fighting 
getting to know eachother. Both girls tasted eachother&#39;s saliva. The 
unexpected sweet taste was different to the taste of human blood that 
Miyu was emotionally used to.

&quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to do this&quot; Chisato admitted

&quot;I&#39;ve thought about it&quot; Miyu thought out aloud &quot;about lesbianism&quot;

&quot;Were you a lesbian Miyu?&quot; Chisato asked.

&quot; Until you came along&quot; Miyu confessed.

Chisato happily kissed Miyu again hastily with her tongue it eventually 
became slower then the arms started to join in the romantic moment 
fingers through eachother&#39;s hair. Lips still close to eachother like 
magnets. Chisato gazed into her golden eyes as she hastily removed 
Miyu&#39;s clothing. This action was a sudden shock to her system as Miyu 
accidentally removed Chisato&#39;s clothing. 

Chisato gasped at Miyu&#39;s figure it was far better than hers. There was 
not a single thing wrong with her. She had the perfect body basically. 
Miyu removed the rest of the clothing and stroked Chisato&#39;s naked body 
then she noticed Chisato&#39;s amazement Chisato inspected Miyu&#39;s golden 
eyes again. She looked exactly like a princess. Chisato could never 
match the beauty of her. Never. Chisato broke the kiss.

&quot;Like what you see?&quot; Miyu whispers. 

&quot;It&#39;s wonderful&quot; Chisato replied ogling &quot;compared to my body&quot;

&quot;I like it&quot; Miyu replied &quot;cute&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve said that since the day you met me&quot; Chisato complained, &quot;if I 
didn&#39;t know better I say you always loved me&quot; 

&quot;I might have, Chisato!&quot; 

Chisato grins. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time, beloved. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re mine.&quot; 

&quot;And you&#39;re mine.&quot; 

&quot;I just wish time would move a little faster.&quot; 

&quot;Be careful what you wish for, Chisato-chan.&quot;

Miyu&#39;s cheek grew even redder in blush as her finger accidentally 
slipped onto Chisato&#39;s clitoris.

&quot;Ahhhh&quot; Chisato moaned causing tremors in her body. Miyu examined 
Chisato&#39;s back undid her bra then removed her panties then left them 
with Miyu&#39;s clothes. Miyu smiled as she slid Chisato down to the bed 
again. They both faced each other again. Breaking every rule in their 
destiny. All four brown eyes glazing at eachother as Miyu reached for 
Chisato&#39;s back then Miyu thrusted Chisato over to herself.

Falling into temptation Miyu carefully slid down with her tongue. Miyu&#39;s 
tongue even fell into Chisato&#39;s naval. Chisato giggled because she was 
very ticklish. Miyu&#39;s breath upon the discreet parts of Chisato&#39;s body 
caused Chisato&#39;s spine to shiver. A whole new world was right in front 
of her. It was a shame it couldn&#39;t last that long. Then they Miyu was 
shoved her tongue through the entrance. Chisato was gasping heavily as 
if she had finished a two hundred and fifty mile marathon. Chisato 
wrapped her legs softly against Miyu&#39;s neck encouraging her actions. 
Miyu was sucking on Chisato&#39;s clit. Sexual pleasures had clouded the 
pain and sanity of them both.

Miyu then crawled up to Chisato again  stopping at Chisato&#39;s heart Miyu 
was surprised of all the fun she was receiving first of all she rapidly 
moved mouth around her chest, tickled Chisato&#39;s back harshly. &quot;God Miyu&quot; 
Chisato exclaimed. Miyu then placed her arms around Chisato like some 
kind of seatbelt. Once again she wrapped her legs against Chisato&#39;s 
waist. Miyu pinned herself to the bed backwards so Chisato was on top of 
her.

Miyu in a desperate manner sucked on Chisato&#39;s breast hard. Chisato was 
screaming out her name. The neighbours could have easily heard. In a 
jealous rage of pleasure Chisato ended up bashing into Miyu&#39;s tits and 
began biting them. Miyu&#39;s breasts looked in lethal danger. Chisato 
concerned that Miyu&#39;s fragile breasts will explode removed them from her 
mouth. Miyu reached one tender finger through Chisato&#39;s passage, 
stroking it gently and then removed the finger.

Miyu twisted Chisato&#39;s auburn hair with her finger. The pitch of the 
breathing increased. The energy followed the shivers down their spines 
and just as you thought the heat couldn&#39;t get any hotter a heat wave 
swirls them both together. Only one colour could be used to describe the 
situation. Red. Red for anger Red for passion Red for desperation Red 
for love Red for heat Red for sex Red for emotion Red for their blushing 
cheeks

Their bodies imploded together rolling on top of eachother on the bed 
about five times. The pitch of the breathing lowered slightly. Chisato&#39;s 
mouth was wide open tilting her head whilst Miyu rested her head on 
Chisato&#39;s breasts. Eventually placed her mouth on one of them whilst 
rubbing the other. Chisato gazed at her whilst she played with Miyu&#39;s 
hair feeling the dark but soft brunette&#39;s hair.

They both gasped in unison with equal pitches. Miyu stopped to face her 
in one quick motion was a tight hug with foreheads close together like 
magnets. The breathing volume increased again. Miyu&#39;s pitch was very low 
whilst Chisato&#39;s was very high. The sensations started again while they 
kissed again their tongues behaving in a hyper manner. As soon as the 
kiss broke Miyu got up. Chisato slid down to Miyu&#39;s entrance and licked 
her clit. Miyu tilted her head backwards feeling the tongue move up then 
down. Breathing heavily Miyu&#39;s breathing pitch slowly became higher. 
Miyu found losing control of her actions feeling almost human.

Chisato enjoyed Miyu&#39;s taste she felt Miyu&#39;s timid legs shiver although 
they were baking hot. Miyu pulled Chisato into another intense kiss 
getting the mix of saliva and her own cum. Chisato reached for her left 
breast and sucked on it. Miyu silently whispered her name as she wrapped 
her right leg around Chisato&#39;s waist. Miyu felt fingers in her passage 
Miyu now used both her arms to examine Chisato&#39;s beige back. Miyu 
gasping rapidly feeling that she was going to receive an orgasm. Miyu 
still in absolute pleasure her face grew red from blushing. Miyu felt 
Chisato remove her hand from her clit and moved to the other bosom. This 
gave Miyu a chance to get up and Miyu&#39;s hands departed Chisato&#39;s back 
and melted in Chisato&#39;s reddish brown hair, then the fingers slided down 
her cheeks Miyu called out Chisato&#39;s name. The forgotten pain was 
clouded in forbidden pleasure. Chisato felt she could explode from all 
this love she was so tired she fell onto Miyu.

Miyu got on top of Chisato and covered herself and Chisato with the 
covers then began to stroke her cheek. &quot;Chisato, from this momement on I 
will only live for you.&quot; Chisato eyes widened as tears were about to 
settle in her eyes. &quot;I know you&#39;ll probably be the only happiness I&#39;ll 
ever get so I&#39;m going to make the most of it. I&#39;ll spend as much time 
with you as I can&quot; Miyu said it calmly whilst wiping the tears away from 
Chisato. Miyu dragged herself into a feathery kiss onto Chisato&#39;s lips. 
As the kiss broke Chisato smiled wanted to return the kiss herself but 
unfortunately fell asleep. Miyu cradled Chisato up to her breasts then 
thought &#39;sometimes the line between friends and lovers are unclear&#39; 
kissed her auburn hair then peacefully put her on the pillows before she 
Miyu herself fell asleep with her best friend Chisato
