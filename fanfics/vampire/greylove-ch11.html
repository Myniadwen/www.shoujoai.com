&quot;I thought she harmed you&quot;

&quot;Her&quot; Miyu remarked &quot;Chisato harm me&quot; Miyu thought it was ridiculous 
&quot;She would never do that&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s betrayed you once&quot; Larva reminded her mistress, &quot;Who knows when 
she&#39;ll do it again&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why I bought her that necklace&quot; Miyu replied to her servant and 
close friend

&quot;I just want you to be careful&quot; Larva stated &quot; I think she is 
distracting you from your destiny&quot;

&quot;I know Chisato has been the only happiness I will ever receive&quot; Miyu 
admitted &quot;I want to make the most of it&quot; Miyu faced Larva and hugged the 
wiry black cloaks &quot;Larva&quot; Miyu frowned &quot;You&#39;ve been like a brother to 
me.&quot; Larva simply placed his hands around Miyu&#39;s hair. &quot;Sometimes you&#39;ve 
been like a father to me. You&#39;re far much more than a servant&quot;

&quot;You in your own private world again&quot; came the voice of Shiina. &quot;Are you 
cheating on Chisato or something? &quot; Shiina asked

&quot;Don&#39;t ask such silly questions&quot; Miyu stated as she and Larva broke the 
hug giving them slight distance between them.

&quot;Chisato&#39;s gonna cover you in chocolate and cream&quot; Shiina laughed

&quot;Shiina&quot; Miyu moaned

&quot;I&#39;m only joking&quot; Shiina complained &quot;Can&#39;t you take a joke?&quot;

&quot;Well you&#39;re not amusing&quot; Miyu smirked patting Shiina on the head.

&quot;I&#39;ve just had a disgusting flash&quot; Shiina admitted

&quot;What a shinma?&quot; Miyu

&quot;No&quot; Shiina replied &quot;Chisato masturbating herself&quot;

&quot;Well guess I&#39;ve left her too long&quot; Miyu suggested, &quot;she&#39;ll be wanting 
me. I think I should go&quot;

&quot;You can stay if you want to&quot; Larva suggested instead. Shiina&#39;s flash 
giving Larva a bad impression of Chisato

&quot;I&#39;m going to see her&quot; Miyu decided, &quot;You two keep me up to date with 
the Shinma. They were tougher than I thought they would be&quot;

-

Miyu returned to the now relaxed Chisato. Chisato was in a dress with 
pink sequels as if she was a celebrity. Miyu saw the increased length of 
Chisato&#39;s eyelashes, Miyu wrapped her arm around Chisato to get her 
attention

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato smiled &quot;It&#39;s you&quot;

&quot;You look cute&quot; Miyu started to say to her &quot;As usual&quot; Miyu began kissing 
the side of Chisato&#39;s neck. Chisato replied by untying Miyu&#39;s hair.

&quot;You always say that&quot; Chisato whispered, &quot;I want you to have your hair 
down tonight&quot; she requested as she twirled over to her &quot;It looks sexy&quot; 
she explained

&quot;Sexy?&quot; Miyu revised making sure that Chisato knew and meant what she 
said.

&quot;Totally&quot; Chisato replied as she placed her back on Miyu then slid down 
till her head was on her chest reaching her white cheek &quot;Still weird 
though&quot; Miyu wrapped her arms around Chisato&#39;s neck as Miyu rested her 
head on Chisato&#39;s shoulder making Chisato feel comfortable and loved.

&quot;What are you going to wear&quot; Chisato asked facing Miyu

&quot;I&#39;m not sure&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;I loved that red dress you wore&quot; Chisato suggested, &quot;That one really 
suits you&quot;

&quot;You know there&#39;s a lot of disco clubs in Ibiza&quot; Miyu added

&quot;Every one knows that.&quot; Chisato giggled &quot;And anyway I&#39;ve realised that 
my pink panties have gone missing.&quot;

Miyu smiled as she pulled up her kimono clads and flashed something pink 
to her quickly. Chisato paid attention as the clads fell back down 
again. As Miyu ran hastily to the bedroom grabbing her red dress and 
placing it on the drawer.

&quot;Hey Miyu&quot; Chisato announced, &quot;I saw that.&quot; Chisato chased Miyu to the 
bedroom. &quot;Give me them panties back&quot;

Miyu jumped on the bed gracefully surrendering to Chisato. She felt the 
light weight of Chisato reaching through the kimono clads trying to get 
her panties back. Miyu tried to calm her down with touch alone. Then 
decided to talk

&quot;Cute-Chisato-Chan&quot; Miyu groaned

&quot;Don&#39;t cute-Chisato-chan me Chisato replied &quot; It..&quot; but before she could 
finish her words Miyu grabbed over to kiss her as she took Chisato down 
to her own level. Chisato broke the kiss and stuck Miyu on he bed. 
&quot;We&#39;ve got about three hours before we go&quot; Chisato stated &quot;so how about 
some fun before we go&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you mean sex&quot; Miyu replied

&quot; Yeah&quot; Chisato replied

Miyu and Chisato kissed in agreement. Chisato reclaimed her panties as 
Miyu slid them off. Miyu slid Chisato&#39;s pink dress off up to her waist, 
whilst kissing heron the lips, moving to her cheek then to her ear. Miyu 
began nibbling it

&quot;Do that again Miyu&quot; Chisato begged as she removed the clads from Miyu. 
Miyu repeated her actions then reversed them. Reuniting in a kiss while 
practising few dance movements. Chisato licked Miyu&#39;s nipple playfully. 
Miyu kept Chisato in the tight hug. Miyu began the to feel shivers from 
her back by Chisato&#39;s curious fingers. Chisato tilted her head up 
leaving Miyu to place her hand on her cheek. Miyu felt a sweet tingling 
by Chisato&#39;s tongue. Then Miyu dodged Chisato whilst their fingers tied 
with eachother.

Miyu reached over to grab the red fabric whilst holding Chisato&#39;s hand 
gracefully. Chisato realised the tender hand touched the red silk, 
examined it with a stroke then helped Miyu place it on. As Miyu stood up 
Chisato placed the shiny pink straps back to her shoulders. &quot;Are you 
ready Miyu?&quot; Chisato asked as she linked Miyu with her arm. Miyu smiled 
&quot;I&#39;m ready when you are&quot;



The afternoon went pretty fast for the girls. They enjoyed a fresh salad 
in the resturant whilst trying to act appropriate and realising they 
spoke Spanish fluently. They walked onto the same beach again with peace 
holding hands. Compared to the last time they were on the beech it was 
quite peaceful, people minding their own business and there was no 
Shinma to disturb. Chisato rested on Miyu&#39;s shoulder with a sense of 
comfort. 

&quot;Do you like it here Miyu?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;I like it here&quot; Miyu replied kissing Chisato on the cheek

&quot;So did you think I spoke well to the waiters?&quot; Chisato asked &quot;I think 
I&#39;ve done terrible&quot;

&quot;You did pretty well&quot; Miyu replied &quot;Better than I could have done&quot;

&quot;No way&quot; Chisato replied &quot;You did better&quot; Chisato looked at Miyu

&quot;When does the disco start?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot; About nine&quot; Chisato replied then looking at her watch &quot;We better we 
making our way there&quot;

&quot;Okay&quot; Miyu obliged grabbing her hand leaving the kind beach and to the 
hyper party



Colours flashing throughout the darkness, music filling the silence as 
dancing crowds lifted up the atmosphere. They could see the dancers 
enjoying what the music looking at the distance they saw binge drinkers. 
Miyu and Chisato were back-to-back heads tilting back on their shoulders 
as they heard the song Clint Eastwood by Gorillaz. Their hands were 
still close to eachother as they twirled around to face eachother. 
Chisato pulled Miyu down with her until Chisato felt her auburn hair 
reach the floor then wrapped her leg around Chisato&#39;s waist. They keep 
firm eye contact 

Miyu sharply placed her back up and she kissed Chisato as Chisato 
gracefully dropped her on the dance floor as Miyu wrapped her arm around 
her waist. They were trying to behave raunchy, sexy and sweet. Miyu 
glided up Chisato as her face felt the fabric and soft skin. Chisato 
placed her left leg between Miyu&#39;s lengthen wrapped her other leg around 
Miyu as she spun around with the red lights reflecting on them. The 
other partiers watched their competion and decided to dance harder.

The DJ decided to wash the sweat of the dancers. After a change of song 
he pressed a button and dashes of rain formed. The water droplets were 
fresh and cold. The water did not change the heat for Chisato and Miyu 
as they still danced sexily as if they were dancing the rumba, samba and 
poso doble.

Chisato&#39;s body attempted squashed Miyu. Both girls closed their eyes as 
they danced around to blend in the dancing crowd. Miyu felt tired 
already. She had no idea how the humans could dance for three long 
hours. Miyu was already getting exhausted and eventually fell away from 
Miyu. Chisato eventually catched her.

&quot;Are you alright Miyu?&quot; Chisato shouted, as the music was too loud to 
talk normally. Miyu got up with Chisato&#39;s help &quot;Maybe we should go to 
the bathroom&quot; she suggested and Miyu on her shoulder she took herself 
and her vampire lover to the door with a stickwoman on it. It was very 
quiet outside the cubicle there was a drunk person who was rolling 
around on the floor. Miyu caught this to her attention the exhaustment 
made the temptation grow she crawled over to the pissed woman and 
reached for her neck. Miyu finally felt some hydration. Chisato took no 
action but looked at her vampire princess in action.

Chisato stared at her beautiful girlfriend as Miyu dropped her on the 
floor Chisato wrapped her arm around her &quot;Do you feel better Miyu&quot; 
Chisato asked as she wope clean the blood on Miyu&#39;s face. Miyu took a 
huge breath and hugged Chisato &quot;I&#39;m fine now&quot; Miyu kissed Chisato&#39;s warm 
cheek feeling the shine of her make-up. Then hands connected left the 
bathroom and returned to the dance floor. &quot;I&#39;m gonna get some drinks&quot; 
Chisato suggested, &quot;You stay here&quot; Miyu nodded as Chisato walked quickly 
to the bar, Miyu watched the adults dancing around. She wondered why was 
is acceptable in places like this but inappropriate elsewhere. Miyu felt 
a prick on her back then a sudden pull from her dress then a swift to 
the other way. Miyu felt the dark wiry cloaks bang on her head. Miyu got 
up and saw her servant before as he removed his mask.

&quot;Larva&quot; Miyu thought, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Looking for you&quot; Larva replied

&quot;Any Shinma up to no good lately?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;No&quot; Larva replied &quot;Have you been taking blood lately&quot; he then asked 
with concern to the vampire princess

&quot;&quot;I just had drained a drunk woman of her blood&quot; Miyu admitted

&quot;That&#39;s okay&quot; Larva replied sensing she was telling the truth. &quot;Why has 
she dumped you here&quot; Larva asked not bringing himself to mention 
Chisato&#39;s name

&quot;Chisato&#39;s gone to get some drinks&quot; Miyu replied reaching over to kiss 
Larva on the cheek. Larva wrapped his arm around Miyu running his red 
nails through Miyu&#39;s brown hair.

&quot;Miyu&quot; came the voice of Miyu. The embracement immedietly stopped and 
Larva vanished. Chisato had four bottles of blue bottles. Chisato sat 
herself on a sofa with the glass table Miyu decided to sit next to her.

Miyu saw Larva in a distance in his mask Chisato gave Miyu two bottle.

&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;Vodka&quot; Chisato replied

&quot;Are we allowed?&quot; Miyu asked in confusion

&quot;It&#39;s just for one night&quot; Chisato replied &quot;Come on try it&quot;

Miyu looked at Larva to find some wisdom Miyu touched the bottle and 
reached it to her mouth then saw Larva shake his head in disapproval. 
With this Miyu placed the bottle down looked over to Chisato who guzzled 
the vodka down then reached for the other bottle. Then a pink-rabbit 
like beast jumped on the table. Reached for the straw and treated 
herself for some vodka. Miyu reached over to kiss Chisato. Shiina knew 
that Miyu wasn&#39;t going to drink her bottles anyway. Whilst the kiss was 
deep Shiina found it the opportunity to drink the drinks.

&quot;Don&#39;t forget about Miyu getting covered in chocolate and cream&quot; Shiina 
shouted out

Miyu broke the kiss and exhibited a flame from her hand. Shiina 
drunkenly fell off the table.

&quot;Let&#39;s go home Chisato&quot; Miyu whispered

&quot;Okay&quot; Chisato replied



&quot;What a night&quot; Chisato exclaimed &quot;I liked the dancing what was your 
favourite bit?&quot; 

&quot;Dancing with you&quot; Miyu admitted &quot;And watching Shiina fall off from the 
table&quot;

&quot;Well you do have a sense of humour then Miyu&quot; Chisato declared as she 
reached over for chocolate sauce and cream then placed both the 
containers on a basket of strawberries. Chisato decided they could have 
more fun with ice cubes is well. Placing the two containers on a side. 
The strawberries joined the ice cubes in a blender leaving one in her 
mouth. The lid was firmly placed on the blender by the grip of Chisato 
as she pushed the button. The red fruits turned into pink mixture, the 
ice cubes shattered in the blender. Chisato felt the coldness from the 
ice. The machine stopped Chisato carried three containers over to the 
feminine bedroom. Closing the door behind her then danced over to place 
the containers near the bedside table. The auburn haired girl reached 
over to close the curtains that did not feel soft but trusted.

Chisato skipped to Miyu who was half ready to sleep. Chisato aware of 
this pulled Miyu up to her level. Her strawberry still in her mouth 
without any bite marks but protected in saliva. Chisato closed her eyes 
as her lips touched Miyu&#39;s firmly waiting to let Miyu invite the berry 
in. Miyu placed her arms into Chisato&#39;s dress as the kiss turned 
intense. Miyu invited Chisato&#39;s tongue in. Miyu felt the strawberry&#39;s 
taste that occupied the teeth whilst the tongues tried to touch 
eachother.

The strawberry felt fresh and sweet as the kiss broke the strawberry 
split into two. Drops of the juice dripped. Both of the girls swallowed 
the berry then kissed in strawberry flavour. As their dresses slid off 
in unison on either side of the bed. Chisato turned the lights off. Now 
the room was all blue naked bodies to eachother&#39;s eye. Chisato reached 
for the chocolate sauce and cream

&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting all night to do this&quot; Chisato confessed as Miyu 
rested on the silky quilts. Chisato kissed Miyu&#39;s breast one after 
another. After repeating the action twice Chisato poured the chocolate 
sauce all over Miyu&#39;s chest leaving giggles in between. Chisato poured 
it around Miyu&#39;s legs. Miyu felt the cold sticky sauce all over her as 
it cooled her hot sweaty body. Chisato complained in her body language 
as the sauce ran out but was short-lived when Chisato took the cream. 
Miyu felt even colder drops on her body especially on her breasts.

Chisato emptied the cream on to Miyu hastily; she just wanted to get 
everything over and done with. Chisato placed her mouth onto Miyu&#39;s 
breasts straight away. Miyu instantly felt the heat change from the cold 
cream to Chisato&#39;s mouth Miyu tilted her head to gaze at Chisato-chan. 
Miyu saw the rapture in her eyes with Chisato&#39;s flamboyant lips. Miyu 
felt the rapture herself. She felt like an electrical current. These 
familiar tremors that were lurking in her body. Miyu felt unfamiliar 
warm drops around her legs not from her but Chisato.

As Chisato decided to lick around her body. Miyu felt the warm saliva 
replace the cold cream and sticky sauce. Chisato was moving very fast 
whilst licking every inch of Miyu&#39;s body. Miyu gasped as he felt the 
tongue around her private area sneaking into her clit. Miyu fiddled with 
Chisato&#39;s hair to encourage the actions. Whereas Chisato felt intense 
and delighted she complained in her mind as nearly everything was licked 
off in a matter of minutes. She stood up looking upon her own body as 
Chocolate sauce and cream was messed on her body. Chisato licked her 
fingers and hands clean to touched Miyu&#39;s cheek. Miyu felt the warm damp 
hand on her cheek. She was wondering why she stopped, opened her eyes 
and saw the auburn haired girl&#39;s body in a mess Miyu licked Chisato 
clean in kindness.

After licking eachother, they both shared the strawberry slush with 
shattered ice cubes. Chisato rested on Miyu&#39;s chest. Miyu felt Chisato 
breathing on her breasts. Miyu dropped her head onto Miyu&#39;s shoulder. 
The surprisingly clean hair made full contact. Despite no chocolate, 
strawberry or cream the sweet smell still lurked on their bodies and 
stained on the sheets. &quot;Wasn&#39;t that fun Miyu&quot; Chisato asked tilting her 
head to face Miyu.

&quot;That was fun, sweet and cute&quot; Miyu admitted

&quot;I knew you would say cute&quot; Chisato whispered &quot;how cute.. I mean weird 
is that?&quot;

&quot;Not very&quot; replied Miyu but before Miyu could explain she fell asleep in 
her arms

&quot;I&#39;m glad I found you&quot; Miyu whispered to herself as she watched Chisato 
sleep in her arms
