Chisato woke up in a glorious day. Chisato couldn&#39;t be bothered to get 
up instead she gracefully stared at Miyu, Chisato then removed the 
quilts to reveal Miyu&#39;s breasts Chisato placed her mouth on one breast 
with her eyes gently shut Chisato&#39;s right index finger trembled down 
into Miyu&#39;s private area touching her clit.

Miyu woke up then received a shock as she was getting more pleasure Miyu 
had nearly forgotten that she was a vampire and the guardian at one 
point. Chisato realised Miyu was awake then sucked on her breast harder. 
Forbidden sensations crawled all over Miyu clouding her physically and 
mentally.

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu breathed, &quot;Don&#39;t you ever get bored doing that?&quot; Chisato 
got off her breast to face Miyu &quot;No&quot; Chisato replied &quot; I get pleasure&quot; 
Chisato placed a firm intense kiss onto Miyu&#39;s lips forbidden, maybe 
disgusting yet, inviting. Miyu&#39;s legs had split apart wrapping them 
around Chisato. Then they both fell off the bed gracefully to the floor 
then Miyu broke the kiss.

&quot;I think we should both have a shower?&quot; Miyu gasped

&quot;Shower?&quot; Chisato announced &quot;I&#39;d love to have a shower with you&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t exactly mean together&quot;

&quot;We can if you want to&quot; Chisato smiled &quot;please come with me,&quot; Chisato 
begged

&quot;OK&quot; Miyu replied

--------------------------------------------------------

The water felt fresh upon them both. They rubbed eachother&#39;s body; 
tongues dancing in eachother&#39;s mouths, silent moans of pleasure were the 
music.

&quot;What should we do today?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;Haven&#39;t we got school today?&quot; Miyu reminded her lover

&quot;One day off won&#39;t hurt&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s exams today&quot; Miyu stated aren&#39;t they important &quot;we revised all 
night it would have been ashamed of that time to go to waste.&quot;

&quot;You are so weird&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re too cute for you&#39;re own good&quot; Miyu sealed a kiss on 
Chisato&#39;s lips &quot;and besides, you can fuck me after school or finger me 
at recess&quot;

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right&quot; Chisato announced, &quot;I guess I am being a bit too 
horny&quot;

&quot;And some time you&#39;ll have to meet Larva&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure about that?&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s your ex-boyfriend&quot;

&quot;No he&#39;s just my friend nothing more&quot; Miyu announced &quot;my only friend&quot;

&quot;What about me?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re my lover&quot; Miyu stated

&quot;But what about Larva, didn&#39;t he love you?&quot;

&quot;In a way yes and in a way no&quot; Miyu stated &quot;we are very close friends 
are we gonna get out or are we staying&quot;

&quot;School&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------- 
After school

&quot;You remember this route Chisato&quot; Miyu asked her girlfriend on the 
train.

&quot;Yarashirazaka&quot; Chisato replied, &quot;I always liked that place&quot;

&quot;The first place you took me&quot; Miyu stated

&quot;You have such a good memory&quot; her hands clasped in begging action onto 
Miyu&#39;s hand

&quot;What should we do?&quot; Chisato hissed under her ear

&quot;Shopping, lunch, dancing...&quot; Miyu confirmed

&quot;Dancing&quot; Chisato, exclaimed

&quot;I thought you liked dancing&quot; Miyu reminded her girl friend

&quot;Not in front of every body&quot; Chisato hissed

&quot;At your place&quot; Miyu assured her &quot;but we could go out&quot;

&quot;Where should we go?&quot;

&quot;You tell me&quot;

&quot;So this is your lover,&quot; a cold voice sneered, &quot;The guardian is a 
lesbian&quot; It was Reiha with her doll Matsukaze

&quot;Who&#39;ve thought it the first ever homosexual guardian&quot; Reiha sneered

&quot;You disgust me Miyu&quot; Matsukaze barked.

&quot;You have gone low in the past&quot; Reiha stated &quot;but never this low, making 
love to a shinma&quot;

&quot;Traitor!&quot; Matsukaze barked

&quot;What&#39;s it to do with you?&quot; Miyu asked, &quot;About who I love. It&#39;s none of 
your business. Besides we will be leaving soon so you can have Japan all 
to yourself&quot;

&quot;Coward&quot; Matsukaze laughed

&quot;If any one&#39;s a coward it&#39;s you&quot; Chisato spat at Matsukaze

&quot;You just won&#39;t listen to me will you Miyu&quot; Reiha sneered &quot;I will be 
keeping my eye on you&quot; Then Reiha and Matsukaze disappeared.

&quot;GOD I HATE HER!&quot; Chisato snapped &quot;Miyu how do you cope with that bitch&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; Miyu replied. The words had hit her. Reiha&#39;s words had 
only caused her pressure. Chisato could see the sadness in her golden 
eyes

&quot;Don&#39;t think about her&quot; Chisato reacted &quot;Just ignore her&quot; Miyu felt a 
warm hand touch her shoulder leading to the tip of her ear. Chisato&#39;s 
head fell closer to Miyu till it rested on her shoulder.

Miyu gazed at her She looked so cute in that pose Miyu felt like she was 
looking at an angel. Miyu had seen the best and worst of her and Miyu 
gave Chisato eternal sleep. Chisato gave that up just to tell Miyu she 
loved her.

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu whispered pulling her face towards Chisato. &quot;When we 
leave Japan which place do you want to go&quot;

&quot;Place&quot; Chisato repeated placing her hand&#39;s on Miyu&#39;s breast fiddling 
with her collar

&quot;You&#39;re letting me choose&quot; Chisato exclaimed. Miyu nodded &quot;In the 
bathroom&quot; Chisato called out in a joke.

&quot;I&#39;m being serious&quot; Miyu stated

&quot;Ibiza&quot; Chisato called out

&quot;Well I&#39;ll have a talk with Shiina and Larva see if there&#39;s any Shinma 
to demolish&quot;

&quot;Disco clubbing, and all the beaches&quot; Chisato smiled

&quot;That sounds good&quot; Miyu stated &quot;you cut out the small talk and skip 
straight to asking me out for dinner&quot;

Next stop Yarashirazaka the exit will be on your left

Chisato and Miyu ran out of the train holding hands. Ignoring the 
reaction off the public. Miyu smiled strongly only for Chisato&#39;s sake.

-------------------

Miyu sat close next between her servant Larva and girlfriend Chisato. 
Larva looked upon the giggling girls it was the first time he noticed 
Miyu laugh in a hyper manner. He never saw her so happy yet, he sensed 
that something was troubling Miyu. Larva had no trust in Chisato after 
what she done to Miyu. Larva found Chisato a threat to his destiny and a 
threat to Miyu.

&quot;Oh Chisato&quot; Miyu pointed &quot; I wanted to give this to you&quot; Miyu gave 
Chisato a necklaces. Dazzling words couldn&#39;t describe it short. Half the 
heart was encrusted with rubies and the other half encrusted with 
sapphires

&quot;M-Miyu&quot; Chisato said stoned &quot;it&#39;s beautiful&quot; she started to cry then 
hugged Miyu tightly

&quot;Deceitful Shinma&quot; Larva muttered to himself

Miyu sat down next to her, on Chisato &#39;s right side. Now Chisato was in 
the middle. Larva felt like he was going to faint. Miyu ran fingers 
through Chisato &#39;s soft hair. She was a sight to look at even when she 
was crying. Leaning forward she planted kisses on her lover&#39;s neck. 
Chisato&#39;s chocolate, brown eyes fluttered open and an &quot;Mmm&quot; sound 
escaped her lips.

&quot;I&#39;m really tired&quot; Chisato yawned &quot;is this how late you stay up at?&quot; 
Miyu stroked her cheek and made her face her golden eyes. Miyu placed 
the ruby/sapphire necklace around Chisato&#39;s neck. Chisato reached out 
for Miyu&#39;s hand realised she had a ring representing her necklace. 
Chisato kissed her hand then her eyes fell onto Miyu&#39;s legs. Miyu turned 
Chisato around so that she could gaze at her beautiful face.

&quot;Miyu&quot; Larva said, &quot;Are you hiding something?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;I feel you are hiding something is it about that shinma girl&quot;

&quot;In a way it&#39;s about Chisato and in a way it&#39;s about ...you&quot; Miyu 
replied &quot;But I&#39;m uncomfortable talking about it&quot;

&quot;Will it make such a difference?&quot; Larva asked

&quot;I&#39;m not really quite sure&quot; Miyu answered, &quot;I&#39;m just worried&quot;

&quot;About what&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m worried that Chisato will deceive me again&quot; Miyu announced &quot;I&#39;m 
scared that you&#39;ll have enough of me and walk away and I will be alone, 
like I have been all my life&quot;

&quot;You were never alone&quot; Larva interrupted

&quot;What was that&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;You were never alone&quot; Larva reminded her &quot;I have been there&quot; Larva 
removed his mask &quot;Even if she does hurt you again I will still love you&quot; 
Larva reached over to kiss Miyu&#39;s lips

&quot;Have you always loved me?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;I have and I still will&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been having problems understanding what love was&quot; Miyu confessed

&quot;It&#39;s a hard question&quot; He replied, &quot;some people search for it all their 
lives&quot;

&quot;So you are jealous of Chisato then?&quot; Miyu concluded

&quot;No I&#39;m happy that you&#39;re happy but I don&#39;t want to see you hurt again&quot; 
Larva assured Miyu &quot;I care for you and it hurts me to see you upset&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad I have you&quot; Miyu replied returning the kiss to Larva

&quot;Boy, that chemistry has gotta stop&quot; Shiina complained
