<a href="../vampire/greylove-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Chisato&#39;s POV

I walk feverishly in the night. I blown it I knew I had. I might as well 
go back I failed. I should &#39;ve explained more slowly or get her by her 
own.

Wait a minute I&#39;m a shinma I&#39;m not supposed to understand emotion.

Hey so is Larva and Shiina they&#39;re the only ones that really understand 
her or even know her. As for me I took advantage of her purely.

Then I spot Miyu on the rooftop of a church

&quot;Miyu, we need to talk,&quot; I begged

Miyu didn&#39;t look at me she just stared to the floor

&quot;Larva&quot; Miyu said to her protector &quot; I&#39;d like to talk to Chisato alone&quot;

&quot;Very well&quot; Larva hissed. &quot;Just call out my name if it gets into 
trouble&quot;

Larva walks away he stares at me horribly. He has every right to be 
angry with me.

Miyu steps of the rooftop gracefully and we both walked down the 
graveyard.

Then we stopped at Yukari&#39;s grave. Hisae&#39;s grave wasn&#39;t very far either.

&quot;What did you want to talk to me about?&quot; Miyu hissed at me

&quot;I can&#39;t explain carefully,&quot; I started &quot;and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going 
to like me, you have every right to be angry with me.&quot; I was gasping I 
just wanted to say it

&quot;Slow down Chisato&quot; Miyu asked, &quot;We have plenty of time&quot;

&quot;Well, I wanted to tell you that I love you&quot; Chisato announced. &quot;I 
always loved you&quot;

&quot; Then why did you want to kill me?&quot; Miyu asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; I replied &quot;since my family and I were stray shinma it was 
our duty to kill the guardian. I had to accept the facts. I could never 
love you; let alone be your friend.&quot; Then I started to get a bit 
confident as Miyu looked at me she was paying full attention &quot;But since 
the day you sent me to the darkness I regretted following the family 
duties. No one ever understood my secret torment.&quot; I paused I&#39;m 
surprised I done this I had to make it simple &quot;Miyu... what I&#39;m trying 
to say is that I love you and I want to be with you for the rest of my 
life.&quot;

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu asked me &quot;did you really think of me all this time?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot; I reply with all my might holding her purple obi &quot;even now, I 
should&#39;ve abandoned the duties as a shinma maybe if I did Hisae and 
Yukari would still be alive&quot;

I ignored the tears flowing down her face as Miyu wrapped her arms 
softly around me she swift the tears away from my face. As much to my 
delight she turned my face to her.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how to do this&quot; Miyu openly admitted

&quot;Like the movies&quot; I whisper to her. &quot;Fairy tale. As if you were in a 
fairy tale&quot;

As much to my delight her lips gently touched mine. It felt sweet 
refreshing to my taste.

Miyu&#39;s POV

How I am feeling you can ask?

Well bittersweet

She really loved me?

It&#39;s all just confusing.

Chisato loved me.

She tried but couldn&#39;t escape it.

My head is saying shout out Larva, he&#39;ll sort it out. Chisato will be 
sealed up it will be all over and ok

But my heart is saying love her. She was your closest friend. She&#39;s 
changed forever

I had to follow my heart; I don&#39;t want to get hurt by obeying the rules.

As I kiss her as much to Chisato&#39;s delight I wonder how will Larva 
react?

Normal POV

Chisato and Miyu broke the kiss. Then without even thinking Miyu said

&quot;Chisato, I...&quot; Miyu looked down, she was also afraid, &quot;I love you too. 
I know this whole thing is screwed up and it&#39;s not your fault or mine. 
It&#39;s jus screwed up, that&#39;s all I know, but I know I truly love you. And 
I&#39;ll protect you,&quot; Miyu said this whole thing in one breath which 
surprised Chisato because she was still trying to catch her breath after 
running so fast.

&quot;M-Miyu&quot; Chisato sobbed

&quot;Miyu&quot; Larva called out &quot;everything ok?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot; Miyu replied creating the distance from her and Chisato so Larva 
would suspect nothing &quot;everything&#39;s fine, Chisato has decided to join 
us&quot;

&quot;Join us?&quot; Shiina asked

&quot;She&#39;s made her promise&quot; Miyu announced &quot;that she&#39;ll be by my side for 
eternity&quot;

Larva remained silent. His worse fears had been realised. He foreseen 
the future Miyu is replacing him with Chisato.

Let&#39;s not wait any longer
