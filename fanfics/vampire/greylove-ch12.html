A/N: Well I&#39;m bringing Himeko from the Ova&#39;s I might bring some from the 
manga or whatever

&quot;This is nice Miyu&quot; Chisato whispered lying on top of Miyu, resting on 
her chest feeling her heart beat so neutral.

&quot;Yes it is&quot; Miyu replied softly feeling Chisato&#39;s dependant body rest so 
gently on her. Miyu rubbed Chisato&#39;s back slowly.

&quot;Miyu, what do you think would of happened if I hadn&#39;t had come to you?&quot; 
Chisato asked

&quot;I don&#39;t know I&#39;d probably would still be pretending to hate you.&quot; Miyu 
suggested

&quot;Things have turned out for the better haven&#39;t they?&quot;

&quot;I hope so&quot;

&quot;One day I would want fight with you&quot; Chisato wished &quot;Remember when I 
said we would be friends forever?&quot;

&quot;I remember,&quot; answered Miyu as she had her arms around Chisato harder &quot;I 
remember you saying that we could be friends forever&quot;

&quot;We didn&#39;t really need that chain&quot; Chisato admitted &quot;Cause we&#39;re still 
here now. Do you think we can still call each other friends?&quot;

&quot; Best friends stay together don&#39;t they?&quot; Miyu asked her girlfriend, 
Chisato nodded whilst reaching out for Miyu&#39;s cheek &quot;I think we can 
still call ourselves best friends&quot;

&quot;This is paradise isn&#39;t it?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;If the shinma weren&#39;t rebels&quot; Miyu admitted, &quot;other than that it is 
kinda like paradise&quot;

Then the pink rabbit jumped on the bed disturbing the two curiously.

&quot;Hey why did you leave me on the table last night?&quot; Shiina moaned at 
Miyu. It caused Miyu and Chisato to sit up whilst clinging on to each 
other at the same time.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you come home?&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;I did come home&quot; Shiina replied &quot;So Chisato did Miyu taste good last 
night?&quot;

Chisato had no idea what to say, she really enjoyed last night but did 
not want to embarrass Miyu she nodded faintly.

&quot;We enjoyed last night Shiina&quot; Miyu stated

&quot; I know for a fact you enjoyed last night Miyu&quot; Shiina stated &quot; being 
covered in chocolate sauce and cream sharing crushed ice and strawberry 
licking each...&quot;

&quot; Were you watching us or something?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;This eye here&quot; The cute pink rabbit like beast stated showing her 
yellow blood shot eye &quot;Never tricks me&quot; Shiina then jumped onto Miyu&#39;s 
head &quot;So what&#39;s next then blood and ice?&quot;

&quot;A bit graphic Shiina?&quot; Miyu told the pink beast whilst patting her head

&quot;That was your idea Miyu&quot; Shiina snapped at her &quot;Miyu&#39;s very sick and 
twisted isn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s hardly sick and twisted&quot; Chisato confirmed &quot;She is a bit weird 
though&quot; Chisato reached over and kissed Miyu. The lips nibbling at 
eachother slowly turned into a sexual kiss the lonely and curious 
tongues wiggled into eachother&#39;s mouths bumping into eachother the 
tongues greeted by twisting, turning, dancing and fighting getting to 
know eachother. Both girls tasted eachother&#39;s saliva.

&quot;Whoa!&quot; Shiina gasped &quot;You two better keep it down, Himeko Se moving in 
next door&quot;

&quot;Himeko?&quot; Miyu asked, &quot;You better not be tricking me Shiina&quot;

&quot;I am not lying&quot; Shiina announced &quot;You&#39;re not gonna listen to me are 
you, I best be off&quot; Shiina jumped away

&quot;You wanna go out today?&quot; Chisato asked Miyu

&quot;Sure&quot; Miyu replied



The beach was less crowded than usual but the peaceful breeze was 
present. The white sand that Miyu was used to walking on with her bare 
feet and the warm feeling of Chisato&#39;s hand she was now used too. 

Miyu noticed the broad spiritualist in the yellow shirt and the brown 
trousers. She just hoped that Himeko Se had forgotten her. Miyu tried to 
give her attention over to Chisato, attempting to forget about Himeko 
for the momement.

Himeko thought her eyes were deceiving her. Miyu, the Guardian who was 
suppose to be sealing Shinma away was instead walking around the beach 
with a girl. Himeko looked confused. Why was Miyu with this girl? Himiko 
remembered the girl very well. She could not forget Miyu whom she met

&quot;Hey Miyu that woman&#39;s looking at you weirdly&quot; Chisato pointed out. Miyu 
turned around

&quot;Is that Himeko?&quot; Chisato asked wrapping her arms around her waist &quot;Who 
Shiina was talking about?&quot;

Miyu saw the eyes of shock from Himeko &quot; That&#39;s her&quot; Miyu replied 
&quot;Himeko&quot;

&quot;I guess Shiina wasn&#39;t lying&quot; Chisato stated

&quot;Let&#39;s go near the sea&quot; Miyu complained So they wouldn&#39;t have to 
communicate with Himeko

&quot;Great idea&quot; Chisato exclaimed whilst she was running to the ocean 
dragging Miyu with her hand

Himeko watched over them carefully no way. Could she be a lesbian? She 
stared at them carefully at the girls. Feeling that Miyu was a complete 
liar to say that she was destend for solitude. Himeko was curious of why 
she had Chisato around her. Her eyes widened causing her to blink at 
least three times. She saw the girls lips jointed. Himeko shook her head 
assuming she was imaging things. She shut her eyes tightly then opened 
them again only to prove the eyes were not tricking her. This made 
Himeko even more curious about Chisato and regained her curiosity about 
Miyu. Not only about her being a vampire nor the gaurdian but her 
sexuality.

Meanwhile Miyu took no notice of what Himeko was doing, she was just 
trying to have some quality time with Chisato before either she detected 
a shinma herself or Larva or/and Shiina to call her. The greenish blue 
water was up to their waist both were surprised that a wave hadn&#39;t gone 
over their heads.

&quot;We haven&#39;t gone this far out on sea&quot; Chisato stated wrapping her self 
around Miyu.

&quot;No we haven&#39;t &quot; Miyu agreed

&quot;I&#39;m surprised the waves haven&#39;t gone over our heads yet&quot; Chisato smiled

&quot;I don&#39;t think the waves will go over our heads&quot; Miyu replied &quot;I don&#39;t 
it&#39;s windy enough&quot;

To prove Miyu wrong the feeling of wind came towards their cheek cooling 
the minor blushes along with it a fresh salty wave overcame them 
splashing both their faces causing Miyu to fall on the wet sand banging 
in the water taking Chisato down with her.

&quot;You spoke a bit soon didn&#39;t you?&quot; Chisato told her with a smile on her 
face for Miyu being wrong

&quot;I guess I have&quot; Miyu stated running her hands through Chisato&#39;s wet red 
hair. The laughter stopped and instead gazed into each other, Miyu eyes 
turned golden. Chisato closed her eyes and brought her lips onto Miyu&#39;s 
mouth. Miyu opened her mouth whilst her hand softly grabbed Chisato&#39;s 
cheek whilst wrapping her arm around Chisato&#39;s back, heads tilting 
forwards and backwards.

Himeko was still watching the girls trying to pretend that she was 
reading a romance novel with an aqua blue cover.

&quot;You&#39;re like the sea Chisato&quot; Miyu told her girlfriend. Chisato looked 
at her with confusion wanting to know the reason why she said it. &quot;The 
sea is beautiful because it&#39;s always moving. Beautiful because it 
changes from moment to moment sorta like you&quot;

&quot;I have no idea why I betrayed you&quot; Chisato smiled just wanted to kiss 
her and other stuff.



After a fun day Chisato and Miyu returned to the doorstep of their 
house. Seeing Himeko walk in at the same time. 

&quot;Miyu&quot; Himeko gasped. Chisato tapped Miyu on the shoulder turning her 
around.

&quot;You must be the new neighbour&quot; Chisato exclaimed

&quot;Himeko&quot; Miyu smiled

&quot;So this was who you were talking about Miyu&quot; Chisato announced, &quot;That 
spiritualist you met&quot;

&quot;Yeah&quot; Himeko stuttered &quot;I am that person&quot;

Chisato leaned her head over Miyu wrapping her arms over Miyu showing 
Himeko signs that they were definitely a couple.

&quot;I see you have made a very close...&quot; Himeko didn&#39;t know how to 
translate it &quot;friend, Miyu&quot;

&quot;Girlfriend&quot; Miyu stated wrapping her arm around Chisato leaning her 
face on Chisato&#39;s face

&quot;Yes&quot; Himeko stated &quot;I saw you two on the beach&quot;

&quot;We better go Chisato&quot; Miyu stated opening the door

&quot;Well it was nice meeting you miss Himeko&quot; Chisato said as she bowed. 
After bowing and being polite to Himeko Miyu dragged her into the house. 
Miyu shut the door then locked it with the keys. Miyu chucked the keys 
on the table near the door. &quot;Miyu don&#39;t you think that was a bit rude to 
Himeko...&quot; Chisato was silenced by a kiss from Miyu a very intense one 
for Miyu. Miyu dragged Chisato onto the wall. This was a very intense 
kiss for Miyu, as Miyu didn&#39;t usually rush straight into deep kisses.

-----

Himeko sat in her new house. She kept every thing silent trying to 
discover what else that Chisato and Miyu does. She stayed close to the 
walls that were attached to the other house it was the first time in 
years that she had ever dealt with sexual matters. Himeko finished the 
glass of water. Himeko heard sudden high-pitched breathing through the 
walls in her bedroom she tried to hear what was going on through the 
walls. She heard a conversation going on. She couldn&#39;t comprehend what 
they were saying. She tried to capture the sound with a glass of water. 
She placed the glass onto the wall. The glass Himeko placed her ear on 
the glass trying to hear what they were saying captured the sound. She 
heard Miyu breathing heavily. Then she heard a conversation

&quot; Chisato&quot; Himeko captured Miyu&#39;s voice in the glass &quot;could you do it a 
bit faster&quot;

&quot;Sure&quot;

&quot;Oh Chisato chan&quot;

Himeko heard the bang on the wall direct from the glass causing a sudden 
vibration to the glass

&quot;Sorry Miyu did that hurt?&quot; Chisato asked Miyu. Himeko laid further 
force on the glass trying to hear every word of what they were saying.

&quot;Only a little&quot; Himeko heard silence from that momement &quot; I hope we 
didn&#39;t wake Himeko up&quot; Miyu said.

&quot;She would probably have the telly on or something&quot; Chisato told Miyu. 
Himeko was relieved not to be in any other suspicion yet so it gave her 
time to be more curious. Then Himeko heard more silence. Himeko decided 
that the silences represented kissing. Then she heard deep breaths a few 
minutes later.

&quot;They haven&#39;t informed you about a shinma yet Miyu&quot;

&quot;Because they&#39;re not being active yet. They like playing hide and seek 
with me&quot; Himeko&#39;s tough grip caused her to break the glass and 
accidentally knock some stuff over.

&quot;Was that a Shinma or something?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;No, Himeko&#39;s been listening&quot; Miyu finally found out that Himeko was 
listening. Himeko gasped and ran away.
