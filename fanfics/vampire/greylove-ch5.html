Chisato all covered in make-up picked up a thin box of powder. She 
opened the box. It was pink blusher she scattered it all over her friend 
Miyu&#39;s face. Taking are of Miyu&#39;s beautiful face. She looked pretty 
without makeup but amazing with it. She then placed a red stick on her 
lips making her look like goddess.

&quot;How come you&#39;re being kind to me?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;You&#39;re letting me&quot; Chisato replied as she holded out eyeliner aiming at 
her eye

&quot;Why are you poking that in my eye for?&quot; Miyu asked turning away from 
the eyeliner

&quot;It&#39;s eyeliner&quot; Chisato assured her &quot;now just hold still Chisato 
carefully placed the eye-liner where it needed to be. &quot;now for the 
mascara&quot; Chisato cheered she hastily  tried to increase the volume of 
her lashes then she done the bottom.

&quot;What&#39;s this then?&quot; Miyu asked holding a tin of black powder about to 
put a finger on and place it on her cheeks

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato hastily replied kneeling towards her. Miyu&#39;s sudden shock 
reaction made her drop the tin causing some of it to go all over 
Chisato&#39;s cheek and a bit on her hair.

&quot;Black eye-shadow&quot; Chisato replied

&quot;oh&quot; Miyu said &quot;sorry about ruining your make-up&quot;

&quot;it&#39;s ok&quot; Chisato giggled as she smiled &quot;Do you ever think about love 
Miyu?&quot; Chisato asks her out of the blue while she was doing her make-up, 
a touch of nervousness in her voice as she looked at her. 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Miyu answers back, unsure of what exactly to say, &quot;Like, I 
wonder when I&#39;ll ever meet that Prince Charming, you know?&quot; 

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;

Chisato then paused &quot;never mind, so how about silver mascara?&quot;

&quot;you already put some on!&quot;

&quot;just some more for the mystic effect&quot;

the silver mascara added what Chisato intended her to be. She looked 
mysterious, beautiful and exotic, like the princess inside of her.

&quot;now I know what that Lazar guy, no, what&#39;s his name?&quot; Chisato asked 
struggling to remember Miyu&#39;s servant&#39;s name

&quot;Larva&quot;

&quot;I now what Larva sees in you now&quot;

&quot;What do think he sees in me?&quot; Miyu asked blinking her eyes.

Chisato took a long breath than Miyu shivered at the pleasure she felt 
as Chisato tightened her hand&#39;s grip on Miyu&#39;s face &quot;what do you think 
he sees in you?&quot;

&quot;A friend, a servant, a vampire, my only companion&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re far more than a vampire to me&quot; Chisato replied moving closer to 
her. &quot;I think you&#39;re pretty face, graceful and you have me&quot; . Miyu 
especially felt nervous, but soon she relaxed as Chisato grabbed her 
hand.

 Chisato felt suddenly empty when she realised Miyu&#39;s hand.

&quot;did you feel the emptiness when I letted go of your hand?&quot;

&quot;your hands so warm&quot; Miyu replied.

Chisato smiled as she went under the sheets of the bed wrapping her and 
Miyu around it.

&quot;I love you Miyu&quot; Chisato announced, locking Miyu&#39;s lips with hers. 
Under the sheets their legs where wrapping eachother 

Miyu took no attempt to back away instead she joined inhaling fun. It 
takes two too tango and this phrase was certainly in action.

&quot; You really want to stay with me, Miyu? &quot;Chisato asked, &quot; Even though 
I&#39; tried to kill you and confused on you about the word friend? &quot; 

Miyu smiled, &quot; Sure. This is where I belong, &quot; Miyu began kissing the 
side of Chisato&#39;s neck. Enjoying the new experiences of a homosexual, it 
was possible that she was bisexual; she threw all her problems away and 
continued the embracement 

Chisato slowly exhaled as Miyu&#39;s attentions continued, moving lower onto 
her shoulder. &quot;Mmmmm, that feels good,&quot; she breathed, eyes closed as a 
single tear fell on her cheek it was black due to the mascara as Miyu&#39;s 
soft light skin lightly tickling her beige skin along with hyper arms 
into the movement over their heads.

Chisato slid of the bed to the floor beside Miyu, their mouths and 
tongues meeting again the dark sheets dragging along with them. 

&quot;Now,&quot; Chisato said, slightly breathless holding Miyu&#39;s chin, &quot;aren&#39;t 
you glad we made up?&quot; 

&quot;Definitely,&quot; Miyu breathed, giving Chisato one more passionate kiss. 
Soon Chisato fell asleep on top of Miyu. Miyu noticed that Chisato 
rested on her breast very comftably. Miyu slid Chisato back on the bed 
covered her in her sheet then her gentle hand stroked Chisato&#39;s cheek. 
Then she kissed it

Miyu drifted in a state fog. She was not happy, she was not sad; she 
simply existed with all her emotions whirling around her. She felt so 
many things at once but she found herself unable to lock onto any 
emotion for longer than a few seconds.

Miyu gazed at her lover. Chisato had made her sad, happy, upset, angry, 
hurt and touched. Miyu then closed her eyes her two fingers on her lips

a cool breeze blowing into the room. Miyu took it as an invitation, 
stepping towards the doors and out onto a balcony. There was nothing to 
be seen but fog, yet the aura was calm, peaceful. She sucked in a deep 
breath, trying to quiet the loud banging of her heart against her 
ribcage.

Miyu twirled over only to be bashed into sudden lump of darkness, she 
gasped as she got up and returned to her senses she noticed it was 
Larva. Realising that her servant might have caught her kissing a girl 
and that she was in nothing but her underwear created embarrassment to 
Miyu.

&quot;Good evening Larva&quot; Miyu reacted speechless of the incident

&quot;I seemed to have come at the wrong time&quot; he replied

&quot;no&quot; Miyu told him feeling the heaviness of the mascara &quot;I actually had 
a nice night&quot;

Miyu and Larva then looked outside the balcony,

&quot;Larva, can I ask you a question and I want your honest opinion?&quot;

&quot;anything, Miyu&quot; Larva hissed 

&quot;How do I look in all this make-up?&quot;

&quot;I prefer you without the make-up&quot; Larva replied, &quot;you look 
uncomfortable in it?&quot;

&quot;You can read my mind&quot;

&quot;so, how was she too you?&quot;

&quot;she was nicer to me than usual, covered me in make-up saying I was 
pretty,&quot; Miyu started &quot;she asked me about love then after that she 
kissed me and I kissed her back&quot; Miyu then went back to the bedroom to 
remove her make-up . She picked up a white cloth and started removing 
the makeup &quot;but Larva,&quot; Miyu continued &quot;I love her dearly, but as a 
sister, a friend. I don&#39;t want to be her whore&quot;

&quot;What did she tell you?&quot; Larva asked

&quot;all she kept on saying was how pretty I was and how much she wants to 
kiss me&quot; Miyu sighed, turning to look into the mirror once more taking 
away the entire make up. &quot;It&#39;s just so shallow.&quot; Miyu complained looking 
at the sleeping Chisato &quot;she talks to me as like being &#39;pretty&#39; it&#39;s the 
only thing that really matters.&quot; Then she faced Larva through the mirror 
reflection &quot;Like I&#39;m nothing more than a pretty face.&quot; 

Larva came up behind Miyu, wrapping his arms around the girl&#39;s 
shoulders. &quot;She doesn&#39;t know you like I do,&quot; he said into Miyu&#39;s ear. 
&quot;You&#39;re so much more than just pretty. You&#39;re kind and gentle. She sees 
only your looks because that&#39;s all others see her for.&quot; 

Miyu smiled fondly. &quot;You&#39;re amazing, you know that, Larva? You always 
see right to the heart of everything.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s a gift.&quot; Larva said, &quot;are you feeling better now?&quot; he then asked. 
Miyu nodded

&quot;Yes I am&quot; Miyu replied.

Yes, Miyu loved Chisato but she could never forget Larva, her sworn and 
devout servant and friend, they were bound by blood and destiny. Larva 
was far more than a servant to Miyu, he and the cheeky-pink- rabbit like 
beast Shiina were like the family Miyu lost. Larva was her protective 
elder brother and Shiina would be the annoying little sister

However Miyu had to earn this friendship. Larva was originally sent to 
kill her. Chisato however was her friend that betrayed her. The friend 
she forgave. It looked like she never had to choose between them after 
all.
