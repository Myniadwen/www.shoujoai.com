<h2>a <a href="../vampire/index.html">Vampire Princess Miyu</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Come on Miyu Chisato thought masturbating herself lightly with the 
circular blade ignoring Yukari who was laying unconscious on the floor. 
I hope you&#39;re coming Miyu I want you now! Then her wish was granted she 
stood up in the classroom where she met Miyu straightened herself out as 
their face-to-face to the girl that had stolen her heart.

&quot;I&#39;ve been expecting you Miyu&quot; Chisato lustfully reacted lying the 
teachers desk smiling at Miyu trying to reveal her legs to a whole new 
level &quot;I am a shinma and I have destined to kill you&quot; Chisato announced

&quot;Chisato?&quot; Miyu asked &quot;what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m lovesick&quot; Chisato playfully whispered &quot;that&#39;s why I&#39;m not gonna 
kill you&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t make me do this&quot; Miyu said maintaining her anger

&quot;Do what?&quot; Chisato whispered. Miyu remained silent &quot;come closer to me &quot; 
Chisato begged succeeding being Miyu&#39;s centre of attention. Miyu obliged 
as she walked closer she noticed the top two buttons of Chisato&#39;s school 
dress was undone revealing her chest.

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu snapped getting angry at Chisato&#39;s strange behavior. 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; Miyu asked as tears begging to flow show in her 
eyes. Then she slapped her. &quot;get a grip of yourself&quot; Miyu demanded no 
it&#39;s me I should get a grip of myself 

Chisato had her blade at the ready to kill Miyu. &quot;I have to kill you 
now&quot; Chisato replied, &quot;It&#39;s my destiny........... But I&#39;m not gonna do 
that!&quot; Chisato dropped the blade. Miyu smiled mildly.

&quot;Why did you do all those horrible things&quot; Miyu asked killing off the 
distance creating an embracement as they stroked eachother&#39;s cheek.

&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; Chisato replied starting to cry, &quot;I-it j-just never 
mattered to me as long as I got your attention&quot;

&quot;My attention?&quot; Miyu asked Chisato&#39;s tears were staining Miyu&#39;s white 
dress.

&quot;You were always with Larva, I wanted to admit my feelings to you but I 
couldn&#39;t you already have someone else&quot;

Miyu hesitantly placed her lips on Chisato&#39;s cheek leading to a kiss on 
the mouth. As the kiss the broke Miyu said &quot;he means nothing to me 
compared to you.&quot; Miyu smiled &quot;he&#39;s just my servant nothing more but a 
dear friend&quot;

&quot;Just friends?&quot; Chisato gasped

&quot;Just friends&quot; she replied

Chisato happily kissed Miyu again hastily with her tongue it eventually 
became slower then the arms started to join in the romantic moment 
fingers through eachother&#39;s hair. Chisato dragged Miyu under the table 
lips still close to eachother like magnets. Chisato gazed into her 
golden eyes as she hastily removed Miyu&#39;s clothing. This action was a 
sudden shock to her system as Miyu accidentally ripped of the buttons 
and removed Chisato&#39;s clothing. Chisato gasped at Miyu&#39;s figure it was 
far better than hers. There was not a single thing wrong with her. She 
had the perfect body basically.  Miyu removed the rest of the clothing 
and stroked Chisato&#39;s naked body then she noticed Chisato&#39;s amazement

&quot;Like what you see?&quot; Miyu whispers. 
 
&quot;It&#39;s wonderful&quot; Chisato replied ogling &quot;compared to my body&quot;

&quot;I like it&quot; Miyu replied &quot;very cute&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve said that since the day you met me&quot; Chisato complained, &quot;if I 
didn&#39;t know better I say you always loved me&quot; 
 
&quot;It was your idea, Chisato!&quot; 
 
Chisato grins. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time, beloved. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re mine.&quot; 
 
&quot;And you&#39;re mine.&quot; 
 
&quot;I just wish time would move a little faster.&quot; 
 
&quot;Be careful what you wish for, Chisato-chan.&quot; 
 
Chisato laughs, a delightful pure laugh. Both girls blush. Chisato was 
on top of Miyu. Miyu moaned in rapture as she stoked Chisato&#39;s cheek 
caressing it gently and lovingly. Chisato did nothing more than that but 
stare into the golden eyes that were roaming hers. In return Chisato 
gave her another intense kiss. The kiss broke slowly ending with the tip 
of her tongue. Chisato decided to lick the down to Miyu&#39;s body. 
Chisato&#39;s tongue then suddenly banged into Miyu&#39;s breast because of this 
Chisato placed her mouth onto Miyu&#39;s breast while her left arm reached 
down to Miyu&#39;s passage to caress her clit. Miyu&#39;s other breast was not 
forgotten Chisato&#39;s right arm was caressing this flesh.

 

Miyu silently whispered her name as she wrapped her right leg around 
Chisato&#39;s waist. Miyu now used both her arms to examine Chisato&#39;s beige 
back. Miyu gasping rapidly feeling that she was going to receive an 
orgasm. Miyu still in absolute pleasure her face grew red from blushing. 
Miyu felt Chisato remove her hand from her clit and moved to the other 
bosom. This gave Miyu a chance to get up and Miyu&#39;s hands departed 
Chisato&#39;s back and melted in Chisato&#39;s reddish brown hair, then the 
fingers slided down her cheeks Chisato then moved down to the lower body 
over to Miyu&#39;s vagina. Chisato sucked on the clit feverishly. Miyu 
called out Chisato&#39;s name. The forgotten pain was clouded in forbidden 
pleasure. Satisfied that she had received an orgasm Miyu flipped over so 
that she was on top of Chisato.

Miyu tried not to plagiarise Chisato&#39;s actions upon her. Instead she 
wanted to give Chisato a far better orgasm. Miyu laid her chest onto 
Chisato&#39;s face Chisato kissed it enjoying every momement of it. Miyu 
used Chisato&#39;s breasts for support. They both faced each other again. 
Breaking every rule in their destiny. All four brown eyes glazing at 
eachother as Miyu stroked the fine thigh of Chisato. Chisato assumed she 
could relax. Miyu was planning to give Chisato something she never 
expected. Miyu reached for Chisato&#39;s back then Miyu thrusted Chisato 
over to herself. Miyu decided to tease Chisato until she begged for 
intercourse

 

Miyu was surprised of all the fun she was receiving first of all she 
rapidly moved mouth around her chest, tickled Chisato&#39;s back harshly. 
&quot;God Miyu&quot; Chisato exclaimed. Miyu then placed her arms around Chisato 
like some kind of seatbelt. Once again she wrapped her legs against 
Chisato&#39;s waist. Miyu pinned herself to the wall backwards so Chisato 
was on top of her.

 

Miyu in a desperate manner sucked on Chisato&#39;s breast hard. Chisato was 
screaming out her name. The neighbours could have easily heard. In a 
jealous rage of pleasure Chisato ended up bashing into Miyu&#39;s tits and 
began biting them. Miyu&#39;s breasts looked in lethal danger. Chisato 
concerned that Miyu&#39;s fragile breasts will explode removed them from her 
mouth. Miyu reached one tender finger through Chisato&#39;s passage, 
stroking it gently and then removed the finger.

 

Chisato was getting more desperate, she felt like she could die just 
from pure rapture. &quot;JUST FUCK ME! JUST FUCK ME!&quot; Chisato begged, as her 
shoulders were harshly moving. Miyu jumped on Chisato making them both 
to breathe hard Miyu ended up doing the same movements that Chisato done 
to her and Chisato was doing the same movements back to her. Eventually 
they were both whispering out eachother&#39;s name. Their movements were 
getting faster and faster. Chisato happily screeched as she found her 
orgasm. Then they faced eachother again. The past few days had made Miyu 
lose her hunger for blood but instead increased her hunger for Chisato. 

They came at the same time, tasting each other&#39;s essence. After licking 
each other clean, they engaged in another passionate kiss, their tongues 
intertwined, savouring the moment.

&quot;I love you, Chisato. ...&quot; Miyu said, tears settling in the corner of 
her eyes.

&quot;I love you too... I&#39;ll never commit the same mistakes again. I&#39;ll 
always be with you forever...&quot; Chisato said as she licked her tears away 
and gave her a soft kiss...

&quot;Miyu&quot; a man&#39;s voice shouted. Miyu recognised the voice straight away it 
was Larva&#39;s.

&quot;Larva&quot; Miyu called back &quot;is that you?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot; he replied, &quot;where are you?&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter&quot; Miyu replied trying to maintain her normal voice as 
Chisato was sucking on her nipple

&quot;It does to me&quot; Larva replied

&quot;Everything&#39;s fine&quot; Miyu replied &quot;you get some sleep and I&#39;ll explain to 
you later&quot;

&quot;Are you absolutely sure?&quot; Larva asked walking around trying to find 
Miyu.

&quot;Yes I am&quot;

&quot;Well goodnight Miyu&quot; Larva reluctantly replied  

Miyu saw Larva exit. Chisato laughed in rapture.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;What you said&quot; Chisato replied. &quot;I really thought we were gonna get 
caught for sure&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t Larva to see me in this kinda situation&quot; Miyu replied stroking 
on Chisato&#39;s naval. &quot;I think we should put our clothes on and get to 
him&quot;

&quot;Ok&quot; Chisato replied &quot;could we do that again one day&quot;

&quot;Course we can&quot; Miyu replied &quot;but in secret I&#39;m not quite sure Larva 
will take this well at all&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you just tell him&quot; Chisato advised &quot;nothing to be ashamed 
off&quot;

&quot;Thanks Chisato&quot; Miyu smiled &quot;I&#39;m glad I saved you in time and I 
appreciate your support&quot;

once the two girls replaced their clothes on their bodies they left the 
school building holding hands. As they left the school building they 
placed a passionate kiss their tongues gracefully danced   in each 
other&#39;s mouths. Conveniently when they broke the kiss they noticed Larva 
and Shiina both waiting for them.

Miyu had no idea what Larva&#39;s reaction would be about her being a 
lesbian. Chisato shyly went behind Miyu holding a fierce grip in her 
hand.

&quot;why is she so afraid&quot; Shiina asked jumping on Miyu&#39;s free shoulder 
&quot;come on Chisato there&#39;s nothing to be afraid of I&#39;m not gonna take the 
piss or anything&quot;

Miyu took a sigh of relief. Shiina had accepted Chisato, Miyu did notice 
that Shiina swore but in the end she decided not to say anything. But 
that doesn&#39;t mean Larva would approve of it.  

Larva remained silent unknown what to say or how to react. It&#39;s not that 
he felt betrayed or replaced or anything he just felt that if he said 
anything for the momement it could offend Chisato and upset Miyu. He did 
not want to upset Miyu. He was glad that Miyu was happy but he had his 
doubts.  

Miyu watched Chisato sleep Shiina walking around Chisato curiously. Miyu 
found this the perfect to talk to Larva. He did not seem happy. 

Miyu went outside to talk to Larva.

&quot;Larva&quot; Miyu asked, &quot;are you ok?&quot;

&quot;Fine&quot; Larva said coldly

&quot;You didn&#39;t seem to happy when I walked out with Chisato&quot; Miyu 
confronted

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found happiness&quot; Larva replied &quot;but I did warn you not 
to get too close&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;Where were you when I was looking for you?&quot;

&quot;You want the truth?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot;

&quot;I was under the table with Chisato......&quot; Miyu couldn&#39;t bring herself 
to tell the truth come on it&#39;s not as if you&#39;re having an affair tell 
him

&quot;Making love to her&quot; Shiina continued for Miyu. Miyu was glad the truth 
was in the air.

&quot;Why did you hide from me?&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t quite sure how you would react&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;you know I&#39;ll always respect your decision whatever it is&quot; Larva 
replied

Miyu was glad. Miyu will no longer be alone and most of all she was 
accepted for who she was

the lemon was ripped of by my fan fic grey love  chapter six 6 &#145;I will
