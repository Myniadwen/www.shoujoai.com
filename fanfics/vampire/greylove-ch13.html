A/N: May I just warn you that there might be some bits you may find 
disturbing as it includes cutting toes off and if you do not like the 
pairing Chisato/Miyu then you should have left a long time ago

One more thing

Mr and Mrs Aoki are Hisae&#39;s parents

Miss Kashima is Yukari&#39;s mother

Summary: Chisato and Miyu return to Japan so that Chisato can apologise 
to Hisae and Yukari&#39;s parents.

&quot;Chisato-chan&quot; Mrs Aoki smiled at her &quot;Please come in&quot; Chisato knew that 
she was in a terrible state it would have been a whole year since Hisae 
died. Even more stress to Miss kashima as having to deal with stormy 
relationships now having to reflect on her daughter&#39;s life. Chisato had 
no idea weather she even deserved to be here.

A whole hour of talking about Hisae and Yukari how good they were and 
how much of a loyal friend Chisato was to them right until the end.

&quot;I have something to tell you&quot; Chisato announced, &quot;I don&#39;t think that 
you are going to like it&quot; Chisato sat down &quot;I killed them&quot; Chisato sadly 
confessed the sudden three gasps along with instant hidden hatred and 
betrayal &quot;with this sword&quot;

&quot;No&quot; Mrs Aoki Chisato nodded faintly

&quot;I TRUSTED YOU&quot;&quot; Miss Kashima squealed &quot;YOU TRAITOR!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m calling the police,&quot; Mr Aoki announced in a rage

Chisato removed her footwear until she was barefoot she had took out the 
sword she used to kill Hisae, Yukari, her parents and nearly Miyu.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Mr Aoki asked looking at the sword that killed his 
daughter

&quot; If you don&#39;t forgive me&quot; Chisato warned her &quot;I&#39;ll cut all my toes off&quot;

Chisato heard the hard metal hit the floor with mild splashes of blood, 
as Mrs Aoki and Miss Kashima scream along with the sharp pain running 
down her spine as the sword parted three smaller toes from the feet 
whilst scratching her right angle feeling the fresh blood departing her 
as the second larger toe was over bent by the power of the sword

&quot;Don&#39;t do it Chisato&quot; Miss Kashima squealed as she covered her head with 
her face finding the blood around the floor far too disturbing

&quot;Anyone forgive me yet?&quot; Chisato asked feeling like she wanted to scream 
but knew that she didn&#39;t want to be arrested and be separated from Miyu. 
Chisato felt her own tears rolling down her cheeks. Trying to gain 
sympathy from the shocked parents from her elementary school friends.

&quot;I&#39;ll never forgive you&quot; Miss Kashima squealed breaking down

&quot;No more blood&quot; Mrs Aoki requested &quot;NO MORE BLOOD PLEASE&quot; Chisato saw 
the tears rolling down from her face

&quot;You all have to forgive me,&quot; Chisato whispered feeling too weak to 
speak. Chisato stared the sword that was stained with blood &quot;But since 
none of you don&#39;t&quot; Chisato sharply banged the floor with the sword 
separating one toe from the left foot whilst the sword digged in to the 
large toe. Chisato pushed desperately on the handle trying to push it on 
the floor to remove the bone strength from the toe. Chisato felt a drop 
of blood hit her face. She had no idea that this much blood could be 
caused by just simply cutting off your toes. Chisato breathed heavily as 
if she was having an asthma attack as she glared at all the blood that 
was going to waste .All Chisato could hear was screaming, wailing and 
tears she was tempted to call out Miyu&#39;s name yet, at the same time she 
didn&#39;t want Miyu to her in a situation like this. Chisato once again, 
looked at all the blood that stained the Aoki residence and to look at 
all the toes from her left foot scattered around covered in blood. She 
was now ready for right foot as she had no idea weather or not they 
forgave her. Chisato held a tight fist at the sword and tried to repeats 
her actions to the other foot.

&quot;Chisato-chan&quot;

Chisato heard the voice she loved and felt the grip of a hand pulling 
her arm backwards. Chisato felt like someone heard her in a desperate 
time of need. She turned around and saw the golden eyed brunette firmly 
on her arm as she looked over to the upset and scared adults in the room 
&quot;Humans will find it difficult to understand Chisato&#39;s situation&quot; Miyu 
announced

&quot;How did you get here?&quot; gasped Mr Aoki knocking over the table where the 
telephone sat whilst his foot was misplaced as he tripped up and 
separated the phone wire from the socket. Miyu waited until was calm 
down.

&quot;Hisae was a very intelligent girl&quot; Miyu stated &quot;Who took her work very 
seriously, Yukari was strong and brave&quot; Miyu looked at Chisato&#39;s face 
with all the pain of her tragic memories &quot;Both girls were kind, strong 
and intelligent and were always determined to what they wanted to do&quot;

&quot;What do you have to say about that beast?&quot; Miss Kashima wept

Miyu had no idea where to begin there was negative things to say about 
her but so many positive things to say about her. &quot;I don&#39;t know where to 
begin. She has done bad things yet she is so innocent&quot;

&quot;How is she innocent?&quot; Mrs Aoki snapped at Miyu &quot;She killed our 
daughter&quot;

&quot;Calm down darling&quot; Mr Aoki whispered comforting his wife understanding 
her emotions and feelings.

&quot;I love Chisato-chan. I don&#39;t care what she has done or even the fact 
that she is A Shinma. She&#39;s the most friendly, careless and loving 
person I&#39;ve ever met. Please don&#39;t call the police. I need her. She 
means every thing to me. I know that I can&#39;t face all those years ahead 
of me without this girl in my arms besides me&quot;.

&quot;What is a shinma?&quot; Miss Kashima asked as the tears dropped on her 
cheek. The very emotion in the room had left even the most mature of 
adults crying like a three year old. Miyu hoped that they felt Chisato&#39;s 
sorrow and regret

&quot;A shinma is an evil god demon&quot; Miyu stated &quot;They lead humans into utter 
ruin. I am the guardian who&#39;s suppose to seal them up and return them 
into the darkness.&quot; Miyu gazed at the toeless foot then to the auburn 
girl&#39;s face whose smile roamed into Miyu &quot;Chisato&#39;s different she&#39;s 
cute, innocent and sensitive &quot; Miyu didn&#39;t care if she was even 
repeating any thing that she was saying.

&quot;Why are you saying positive things about this monster?&quot; Miss Kashima 
snapped at Miyu referring to Chisato &quot;She killed my daughter&quot; she was 
obviously to upset to have listened to Miyu say that she loved her.

&quot;I love her,&quot; Miyu repeated shamelessly

&quot;How can you be in love with a killer like her?&quot; wailed Mrs Aoki at Miyu

&quot;Because...&quot; Miyu told the upset parents whilst Miyu still had a tight 
grip on Chisato&#39;s arm &quot;I&#39;m a killer too.&quot; Miyu looked

&quot;Don&#39;t blame it all on Chisato,&quot; Miyu implored to the adults &quot;I beg you 
not to call the police. I am to blame for part of this is well&quot; she 
stared at

&quot;How are you to blame?&quot; Miss Kashima snapped at Miyu &quot;You didn&#39;t help 
her did you?&quot;

&quot;I provoked her&quot; Miyu replied feeling the sorrow that Chisato had tried 
to hide from Miyu &quot;I killed her brother, her brother left this sword to 
her&quot; she was referring to the sword she used that made Chisato&#39;s left 
foot toeless. &quot;Chisato reawakened as a Shinma, the sword had made her 
into a killing machine. Even when she was evil I still loved her. The 
first time I saw her face was at school. She offered me friendship. Then 
something strange happened to me. I discovered that when she invited me 
to lunch that I was in love with her in a matter of hours.&quot; Miyu rested 
all her attention on Chisato &quot;Chisato will never forgive herself for 
killing your daughters&quot; Miyu announced sharply moving her head to face 
the parents. &quot; I can&#39;t change what she&#39;s done but I wish if I had 
admitted my feelings to her earlier&quot; Miyu roamed into Chisato again 
&quot;Possibly your daughters could still be here today&quot;

Miyu heard the huge sound of metal hit the ground with Chisato&#39;s sweet 
grunt and felt Chisato&#39;s weight become heavy in Miyu&#39;s arms. Miyu had 
almost forgotten about the blood and toes on the floor. &quot;&quot;Call the 
ambulance&quot; Miyu demanded at them.

&quot;Hello&quot; Mr Aoki cried through the telephone &quot;We have cut off toes here&quot;. 
He announced his address and the flat number, and then he placed the 
phone down. &quot;The ambulance is on its way&quot;

Miyu kept Chisato tightly in her arms making sure she was all right. 
&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu whispered into her girlfriend&#39;s ear &quot;Promise me one 
thing&quot; Chisato smiled at her indicating &#39;anything&#39; &quot;Never do anything 
like that again and if you are feeling down at least tell me&quot;

&quot;I think I can do that,&quot; Chisato whispered feeling weak to speak. She 
shut her eyes and rested on Miyu&#39;s lap. By the time this happened the 
ambulance arrived in a very hasty manner. Pushing Miyu to the side and 
leave Chisato to be sorted by the paramedics.

Miyu watched the paramedics circle around her asking questions to the 
adults. Miyu tried to touch Chisato&#39;s hand as indication that she wasn&#39;t 
alone any more and that she would always be with her. One of the 
paramedics got hold of the necklace that Miyu bought for Chisato.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid the necklace has to come off&quot; The paramedic told Chisato, 
Miyu removed the ruby and sapphire pendant for her and kept it with her 
in the other hand whilst Miyu&#39;s left hand remained on Chisato&#39;s hand 
gently. This caused both girls to smile.

&quot;You two are most calmest girls I&#39;ve ever met&quot; One of the paramedics 
stated

&quot;What do you mean by calm?&quot; Miyu asked looking at the paramedics

&quot;Usually girls are screaming or crying&quot; The other paramedic added whilst 
bandaging Chisato&#39;s left toe. This was in Miyu&#39;s mind all the way to the 
hospital still holding on Chisato&#39;s hand she was relieved that it was an 
ambulance car and they were together, instead of a police car with only 
Chisato in it.



&quot;I was looking at your toes Chisato&quot; Miyu told her when she finally woke 
up after exhaustion and pain. 

&quot;What did they say?&quot; Chisato asked.

&quot;The doctors said they were going to keep you overnight for observation&quot; 
Miyu told her. &quot;I just saw Reiha is well&quot;

&quot;Oh that bitch?&quot; Chisato called out &quot;What did she say&quot;

&quot;She said that my nights would be less pleasurable now&quot;

&quot;That is none of her business Miyu&quot; Chisato called out to her &quot;What we 
do between the sheets it&#39;s none of her fucking business&quot;

&quot;Dos your foot bother you at all?&quot; Miyu asked whilst stroking Chisato&#39;s 
cheek

&quot;Kind of&quot; Chisato told her &quot;Anyway about what Reiha said, she&#39;s totally 
wrong&quot;

&quot;You want it here&quot; Miyu asked her

&quot;We can still do it with our clothes on&quot; Chisato told her &quot;And if you&#39;re 
too embarrassed, you don&#39;t have to it. I&#39;ll wait&quot;

&quot;No if you want to do it&quot; Miyu told her &quot;I will do it&quot; Miyu felt awkward 
doing it as she was used to doing it without any clothes on. However if 
Chisato wanted it she would do it.

Chisato felt two warm hands rest on her bare legs, soft hair, brush up 
and down on her stomach and a tongue caressing her clit. She felt like 
she was in heaven as the pain in her feet started to melt away from her 
mind as she stroked Miyu&#39;s head through her hospital robe. Chisato then 
felt her tongue was dry, some dry feeling the rough dryness as she 
moaned in pleasure her mouth was moving around begging more something 
but had no idea what for.

Miyu removed her face form Chisato&#39;s clit and went to roam in her 
shuteyes. Her moving lips to Miyu were representing some kinda thirst 
that she understood as being a vampire. Miyu placed her lips firmly onto 
Chisato and her lips ceased to move. Which lead to a very passionate 
kiss involving their tongue.

&quot;Miyu&quot; Larva called her, he sounded desperate and quick &quot;We must go to 
France immedietly&quot; He dragged Miyu away from the kiss &quot;A shimna outburst 
has happened in the south of France&quot;

&quot;How many&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;About twenty of them&quot; Larva told her.

&quot; Can I just say bye to Chisato&quot; Miyu requested being realised from 
Larva&#39;s grip

&quot;I gotta fight the Shinma in France&quot; Miyu told Chisato and kissed her on 
the kiss &quot;Don&#39;t worry Chisato I&#39;ll be back as soon as I seal them up&quot;

&quot;Can I come with you?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;I wish you could come with me,&quot; Miyu stated &quot;But you need to recover&quot; 
Miyu rested &quot;Goodnight Chisato&quot; Miyu laid another kiss on Chisato&#39;s 
face, then Miyu reluctantly left Chisato and disappeared with Larva to 
seal off the rouge shinma in France.

of action. I have a lot of good idea&#39;s for the next chapter anyway I
