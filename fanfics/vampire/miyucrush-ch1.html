<h1>Miyu's Crush (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../vampire/index.html">Vampire Princess Miyu</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The room had adorable teddy bears lined up on the pink sheeted bed. The 
wooden desk near the corner had plenty of accessories resting on it. 
This was the bedroom of Chisato Inoue, who had kindly invited her friend 
over for a friendly sleepover. The honey haired girl led her brunette 
friend into the middle of the room where a purple rug laid.

Miyu Yamano sat down peacefully as she listened to her best friend, 
Chisato&#39;s bragging about life. She looked into her huge bright brown 
eyes, and she thought how cute. This had been the first time that the 
private vampire had ever developed a crush before, she was trying to 
keep it easy by staying friends with Chisato. The only problem was, that 
she had concerns, she was the guardian who was suppose to protect 
innocent humans from the demons named Shimna, whose fuel is human 
emotion. She was never able to save the victims, she simply just drained 
them from their blood. She gave them the illusion of the eternal sleep. 
That was the best she could do for the victims.

After Chisato was attacked by a shimna, Miyu felt that she needed to 
protect Chisato and felt the urge to care for her, like the way a mother 
would want to care for their new born. The way she felt for Chisato, was 
much more special, she was like a breath of fresh air and a sudden 
relief from her stress. Chisato made the brunette feel more elegant, 
part of a team and more at home. She was currently enjoying the sound of 
her voice and felt quite pleased that Chisato had invited her over for a 
sleep over; she&#39;ll get to see her sleep and will hear her voice even 
more.

&quot;Miyu, one question I&#39;ve always wanted to ask you,&quot; Chisato pointed as 
she reached for the Miyu&#39;s ponytail. Miyu nodded as she waited for what 
the honey haired girl would say. &quot;Who does your hair and why do you have 
it like that?&quot;

&quot;Because it&#39;s how my mother used to do it,&quot; Miyu replied as she felt her 
heart beat faster. &quot;Before she passed away.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; Chisato&#39;s face started to get sad as she patted Miyu&#39;s side bun 
and moved her loose fringe from her face. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Miyu, what about 
your dad?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s dead too!&quot;

&quot;That means you&#39;re an orphan!&quot; Chisato stated in a panic. &quot;Why didn&#39;t 
you tell me this?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to worry you.&quot; Miyu replied.

&quot;You poor thing,&quot; Chisato said as she wrapped her arms around her as 
rested her jaw on her shoulder. So what who are you living with now?&quot; 
Miyu had no family left in this world, only her servant, Larva. Perhaps 
it was best that she mentioned Larva at this point and tell her the some 
of the truth.

&quot;I&#39;ve been with my protector, Larva,&quot; Replied Miyu. &quot;The closest I have 
to a home, is the rooftop cemetery.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ve been homeless.&quot; Chisato gasped in horror as she hugged onto 
the girl tighter. &quot;You should have told this Miyu!&quot; Chisato told her as 
she continued to hold her in a caring and motherly grip. The way Chisato 
was holding her, gave her long lost precious memories. The way that her 
mother used to hold her was similar to the way Chisato was holding her 
at this present time. Miyu felt even more of that sense of security as 
she gently rested her head on the honey haired girl&#39;s shoulder. Chisato 
felt so soft, so warm, so sweet and so caring.

&quot;I should ask Mom if you can stay here,&quot; Chisato pointed out very 
quickly. &quot;You need a home and a cemetery is no place for someone like 
you to live in.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine Chisato,&quot; Miyu answered as she knew that it was going to be 
difficult, her duties were too tragic and too complicated for Chisato to 
understand. She wondered, if Chisato would think she was crazy if she 
told her the truth and if would damage their friendship all together. 
Her feelings for Chisato, could easily go to waste.

&quot;It&#39;s so dark and gloomy over the cemetery area!&quot; Chisato pointed out. 
&quot;You need a better place to stay and besides, we can look out for each 
other.&quot; Chisato quickly stood up and hurried out the bedroom door. &quot;I&#39;m 
gonna let my Mom know ok. &quot;

When Chisato left, Miyu noticed a loud tapping coming from the window as 
she spotted a pink ear banging near the bottom of the glass. Miyu sighed 
lightly. &#39;Shiina,&#39; she thought as she recognised the pink ears and claws 
struggling to get in. Miyu quietly walked across the window and opened 
it. The pink rabbit shaped beast quickly jumped onto the bed as Miyu 
quickly closed the door. Miyu faced Shiina as the pink beast shook her 
head. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Miyu asked Shiina, curious to know why 
she was trying to get into Chisato&#39;s house.

&quot;I was just curious,&quot; Shiina replied whilst she scratched herself with 
her foot, walking around the bed staring at the soft teddies lined up. 
&quot;And why did you tell her about Larva?&quot; She asked. &quot;He&#39;s not going to be 
happy, let me guess it&#39;s because you got a crush on that girl, isn&#39;t 
it?&quot;

&quot;My secrets are never safe with you,&quot; Miyu stated as she held on to the 
pink rabbit like monster and placed her on her shoulder.

&quot;You didn&#39;t answer my question!&quot; Shiina sighed, &quot;You always dodge my 
questions. You tell Larva and Chisato everything, you&#39;re so unfair on 
me!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry you feel that way Shiina,&quot; Miyu stated as she patted on 
Shiina&#39;s back. &quot;You&#39;re just too nosey for your own good, and don&#39;t 
mention any of this to Larva ok? I&#39;ll tell him in my own time.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Shiina asked. &quot;if I were you, I&#39;d tell him.&quot;

&quot;I know what he&#39;ll say,&quot; Miyu replied coldly. &quot;So telling him now would 
be pointless. Like I said, I&#39;ll tell him in my own time.&quot;

&quot;OK,&quot; Sighed Shiina as she leaned on Miyu&#39;s ear. &quot;Encase you wanna know, 
Chisato&#39;s wearing a thong.&quot; She told Miyu, &quot;A very nice red one.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to tolerate such perverted words from you Shiina,&quot; Miyu 
stated as she pushed the rabbit of her shoulder. &quot;Especially about 
Chisato!&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; The rabbit replied as she jumped onto Miyu&#39;s hair. &quot;I&#39;m telling 
the truth, this eye never fails me.&quot;

&quot;Well Shiina,&quot; Miyu smirked as started to blush quietly. &quot;I never knew 
you liked looking inside other girl&#39;s skirts.&quot; Miyu teased as she was 
well aware that Shiina&#39;s yellow eye that was hidden by her ear could see 
through a lot of things and can even detect things from far away.

&quot;Hey Miyu,&quot; Chisato cried as she bursted through the door. &quot;Mom said it 
was fine, huh what&#39;s that...&quot; Chisato noticed Shiina that was hopping on 
Miyu&#39;s hair. Shiina hastily jumped onto Chisato&#39;s shoulder and leaned on 
her neck gently, so that she could quickly gain respect from Chisato. 
&quot;It&#39;s really cute!&quot; Chisato stated. &quot;What&#39;s her name Miyu?&quot;

&quot;Her name&#39;s Shiina,&quot; Miyu replied. &quot;She can talk as well, why don&#39;t you 
say hello Shiina?&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re Chisato then?&quot; Shiina asked as she stared at Chisato in a 
curious way. &quot;Miyu thinks about you all the time.&quot;

&quot;Hi Shannon,&quot; Chisato giggled as she hugged the pink rabbit tightly in 
her arms. &quot;You&#39;re really cute, and you have a pretty name too!&quot; Miyu 
giggled as she watched Shiina literally get squashed by her crush. As 
Chisato sat on her bedside, Miyu joined her as well. &quot;Oh Miyu, Mom said 
it was fine for you to stay over.&quot;

&quot;Cool!&quot; Croaked Shiina, trying hard to breath through Chisato&#39;s tight 
arms as her ears waved about vividly. &quot;I&#39;m getting choked here!&quot;

&quot;Shannon can stay here too!&quot; Chisato announced as she realised Shiina 
from her grip and stroked her gently.

&quot;It&#39;s Shiina! Not Shannon!&quot; The cute beast stated as she fell asleep on 
Chisato&#39;s lap as she was extremely tired from exhaustion.

&quot;Sorry!&quot; Chisato replied as she patted on Shiina gently as she wrapped 
her arm around Miyu. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Miyu,&quot; Chisato said in a very kind 
voice. &quot;Everything is going to be fine, we&#39;ll be living together, so 
we&#39;ll always be there for each other.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re very kind, Chisato,&quot; Miyu announced. &quot;And you&#39;re so cute too.&quot;

&quot;You are so weird Miyu,&quot; Chisato said holding back some giggles, whilst 
she blushed heavily at the same time. &quot;But thanks, you too.&quot; Miyu smiled 
at Chisato gently as she rested her head on Chisato&#39;s shoulder and 
closed her eyes. &quot;You must be really tired, Miyu.&quot; Chisato yawned as she 
covered her mouth. &quot;Me too!&quot; The honey haired girl placed her head on 
top of Miyu as she held onto her hand. The two girls fell peacefully in 
a slumber.

--

Meanwhile, Reiha, a girl with a heart of ice carrying a doll named 
Matsukaze in her arms surrounded by green grass and a collection of old 
strong trees. &quot;I couldn&#39;t help but over Miyu&#39;s conversation with 
Shiina,&quot; Reiha told the doll. &quot;She&#39;s in love with a female human.&quot; Reiha 
concealed her pure hatred for Miyu inside this possessed doll. Matsukaze 
and Reiha were also both Shimnas themselves who believed that Miyu was 
unfit for her role as the Guardian. &quot;She should not be the Guardian, 
she&#39;s too distracted by her attachment to humans!&quot;

&quot;Exactly Reiha,&quot; Matsukaze stated coldly in agreement. &quot;If anyone is to 
be the guardian it should be you!&quot;

&quot;At least, I would have done the job.&quot; Reiha announced. &quot;Unlike Miyu, I 
wonder if her servant is aware of her feelings for this girl? I assume 
he does know, since Shiina already knows. I always thought they were an 
item.&quot;

&quot;She could be a player,&quot; Matsukaze thought out deviously. &quot;Miyu is a 
disgrace and should be not guardian at all! She&#39;d be better off dead.&quot;
