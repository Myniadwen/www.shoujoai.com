<h1>Grey Love (part 3 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../vampire/index.html">Vampire Princess Miyu</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../vampire/greylove-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Chisato and Miyu ran happily in the woods. They were holding hands as 
they happily behaved like little children. 

&quot;Come on Miyu&quot; Chisato smiled &quot;follow me&quot; 

Chisato dragged Miyu&#39;s arm into the bush. Chisato dived into the bush 
taking Chisato&#39;s arm with her. 

&quot;You seem very hyper Chisato&quot; Miyu replied with a blunt smile on her 
face. 

&quot;Because I am,&quot; Chisato grinned pulling on her white kimono &quot;let&#39;s not 
wait any longer Miyu&quot; 

&quot;Wait for what?&quot; Miyu asked 

&quot;You know what im talking about&quot; Chisato groaned she started taking her 
school dress off. Miyu just simply watched not ogling Chisato whereas 
Chisato was she. 

&quot;What do think of my body? Chisato asked lastingly spinning around in 
only her bra and panties 

&quot;Very beautiful&quot; Miyu shyly announced then she turned her head around 
aware that this was forbidden. 

&quot;Don&#39;t be shy&quot; Chisato smiled &quot;is it your first time?&quot; 

&quot;Yes it is&quot; Miyu replied 

&quot;COME ON!&quot; Chisato wailed as she was taking her bra off &quot; it&#39;s no good 
just me naked come on strip off.&quot; 

Miyu slowly fumbled on her own obi that made Chisato smile even more. 

&quot;Slow, slow, slow&quot; Chisato whispered as she stroked her fine long thin 
brown ponytail 

Finally the obi fell to the ground. Chisato then dragged Miyu into the 
bush then Chisato threw the white garment off Miyu and reveal her naked 
body. 

&quot;FINALLY&quot; Chisato moaned squeezing her breasts hard. Miyu imploded and 
accidentally landed on Chisato&#39;s breasts. Chisato helped Miyu get up 
then claimed her lips on her own. Five seconds she broke the kiss. 

Chisato smiled. She was some sort of beautiful exotic creature that was 
too fragile to touch. 

&quot;How is it so far?&quot; Chisato asked 

&quot;Ok&quot; Miyu lied 

&quot;Let&#39;s continue&quot; Chisato ordered. 

&quot;Should we find somewhere else?&quot; Miyu advised 

&quot;Why not stay here?&quot; Chisato asked 

&quot;The leaves are prickling my legs and I can hardly move&quot; 

Chisato smiled in agreement &quot;let&#39;s go in that pool&quot; Chisato advised her 
arm around her shoulder pointing at the water. 

&quot;Sure&quot; Miyu smiled 

The two naked girls ran into the pool as Miyu slowly sat upon the bank 
and went in whilst Chisato dashed and dived in. 

Both girls were in the water. In an intense hug head to head crouch to 
crouch. Chisato placed her leg in Miyu&#39;s hands. Miyu then placed 
Chisato&#39;s leg around her back. 

&quot;think of all the happy times&quot; Miyu answered to Chisato &quot;think off all 
the good times that we had&quot; 

&quot;and roll it all into one as we make love&quot; Chisato continued for Miyu. 

They kissed. Their tongues rambling in eachother&#39;s mouth examining the 
other girl&#39;s mouth and no teethe could interrupt. The kiss broke as Miyu 
nibbled Chisato&#39;s ear. 

&quot;You are one good kisser,&quot; Chisato whispered as she pulled Miyu down 
with her under the water. Miyu obliged wrapping her arm around Chisato. 

Meanwhile Chisato caressed Miyu&#39;s neck as they both underwater and free. 

Meanwhile Larva stood by himself. Feeling suddenly replaced by Chisato. 
As long as Miyu was happy he didn&#39;t mind. 

It was very windy that night and Larva felt Miyu&#39;s clothes blow in his 
face along with Chisato&#39;s. 

Larva held them tight. Larva was now very, very concerned for Miyu now 

Has Chisato hurt her? Has she been killed? He had failed. He had failed 
to protect her. 

Larva instantly dashed into the forest noticing a bush. He hid silently 
hearing the moans and groans in the water. This caused Larva&#39;s blood to 
boil but maintained it in the cold mask he wore. Placed the clothes in 
the bush were they could see them then hid under the tree. 

He was waiting for Chisato to come out the pool he had his porcelain 
white arm at the ready his sharp red nails prepared. Larva had a sign of 
relief Chisato went out with Miyu. Miyu was alive and safe that was all 
that mattered to him. 

Miyu collapsed from the whole ordeal. Larva tried to make his move but 
then he became paralysed. 

Blood was oozing from Miyu&#39;s back. Infact Miyu was bleeding everywhere 
tears running down her face mixing with the blood. Chisato and stabbed 
Miyu. 

Larva took another step forward. Then Miyu wasn&#39;t covered in blood and 
Chisato didn&#39;t stab her. She wasn&#39;t even crying. It was all a 
hallucination. 

Larva walked away and gave the girls time to themselves. As he did he 
reflected on the future. He had a very good idea what it was. 

The only problem was how to face and accept it. A sudden replace? 

Or maybe he was developing feelings for Miyu.
