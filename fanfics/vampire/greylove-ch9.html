<a href="../vampire/greylove-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The bright Spanish morning peep through the blue curtains

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu whispered, &quot;Wake up&quot;

Chisato slowly opened her eyes and looked at her watch

&quot;It&#39;s three o&#39;clock in the morning,&quot; Chisato complained

&quot;Your watch is wrong&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with my watch&quot; Chisato answered back diving in 
the bed.

&quot;It&#39;s still on Japanese time,&quot; Miyu whispered

Chisato removed herself from the sheets and noticed the light reflecting 
on the curtains &quot;You&#39;re right Miyu, I better get my watch sorted out.&quot; 
Then she slightly wailed when she saw Miyu walking away from her.

&quot;Where are going?&quot; Chisato asked her

&quot;Taking a bath&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;Can I join you?&quot; Chisato asked with a cute face so cute that Miyu would 
find it hard to say no to her.

&quot;Since you so politely asked,&quot; Miyu replied, &quot;come on&quot;

Chisato ran over to Miyu, literally jumping on her nearly.



Chisato and Miyu were facing each other in the bath Miyu&#39;s left leg was 
under Chisato&#39;s right leg. They watched as the hot and cold taps slowly 
filled them. Miyu had a bottle of soap foam then poured it over Chisato. 

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato squealed &quot;Not on me&quot;

&quot;Sorry&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;So silly&quot; Chisato moaned &quot;Ahh&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Chisato?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;The water is hot run some more cold in,&quot; Chisato demanded

Miyu turned over and twisted the cold-water tap then began splashing 
Chisato as mild as possible. The water was filling up more quickly with 
bubbles forming up very big infact the bubbles were so big Chisato and 
Miyu could no longer face eachother they both looked up and see bubbles 
popping on the ceiling. Chisato giggled loudly and noticed a large empty 
bottle of soap foam floating peacefully on the bath water through the 
bubbles.

&quot;I think you put too much soap foam in the bath Miyu&quot; Chisato giggled 
pushing the bubbles away to see Miyu

&quot;You said not to spill on you&quot; Miyu replied as she turned the taps off 
realising a watery churning sound.

&quot;Neither did I mean empty the whole bottle out.&quot; Chisato complained

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you say so cute-Chisato-chan?&quot; Miyu asked with alliteration

&quot;Miyu you are to wired for your own good&quot; Chisato exclaimed then 
appeared on the happy girl laid a sad face which was unfamiliar to Miyu.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Chisato?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;Miyu, have you ever thought something negative about me?&quot; Chisato asked 
Miyu

&quot;I always thought you were cute and kind,&quot; admitted Miyu &quot;until it fell 
apart&quot;

&quot;When my brother died followed by Hisae and Yukari&quot; Chisato informed &quot; 
any way&quot; Chisato added changing the subject &quot;I told my family I had 
feelings for you&quot;

&quot;What did they say?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;My parents were furious&quot; Chisato said sadly &quot;That was the main why I 
killed them. My brother was there to support me and didn&#39;t care I was a 
lesbian but he said I can&#39;t love you because you were the guardian&quot; 
Chisato placed her head down not looking at Miyu

&quot;I always thought that I betrayed you when I killed your brother&quot; Miyu 
declared &quot;When I found out you were a shinma I couldn&#39;t bear myself to 
send you to the darkness so I placed you into an eternal sleep instead. 
But after dealing with the Chinese Shinma Larva told me that it was time 
to seal you up. That I should treat you like every other Shinma.&quot; Miyu 
took a long pause and flicked the water Chisato aced Miyu but Miyu was 
also looking down. &quot; I was angry with myself.&quot; she added, &quot;it was the 
last thing I wanted to do with you. Then after that Larva tried to cheer 
me up and say that you used me, and it was not my fault. I&#39;ve had an 
even colder heart ever since.&quot;

&quot;Is that the reason why you rejected me at first?&quot; Chisato asked leaning 
over to her. Miyu looked on to her and nodded.

&quot;Yes it was&quot; Miyu announced &quot;I understand your previous actions more 
clearly now &quot;

&quot;I thought I was a normal girl,&quot; Chisato confessed

&quot;Another reason why I rejected you&quot; Miyu continued &quot; because I didn&#39;t 
want to choose between you or Larva&quot; Miyu removed a strand of hair from 
her face &quot;Did you remember the time you were in the pool and I was 
crying.&quot;

&quot;Yeah&quot;

&quot;Well i wasn&#39;t crying because I was happy&quot; Miyu honestly mouthed &quot;but 
crying because I feared if i was to be with you I would lose Larva and 
Shiina and if i stayed with them I would lose you&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Miyu&quot; Chisato replied &quot;But you should know I would never let 
you choose between him and me. I forgive you for killing my brother 
Hiyoku but I never seemed to forgive myself I made love to you and I 
always thought that I would be a normal girl but i done stupid things. 
FUCKING STUPID THINGS!&quot;

&quot;No matter what anybody says or thinks,&quot; Miyu said removing wet locks of 
hair from Chisato&#39;s face and eventually began to hug her &quot;You&#39;ll always 
be a normal girl to me&quot;. Chisato smiled then heard the sound of the 
splash then felt a gang of water droplets on her face she closed her 
eyes tightly then opened them.

&quot;Hey Miyu that was not funny&quot; Chisato confirmed splashing Miyu about as 
twice as hard the large bubbles decreasing in size. Both girls were 
having fun behaving like three year olds. They both hugged eachother 
after the childish play. &quot;Hey Miyu&quot; Chisato then said, &quot;I&#39;ve noticed 
Larva hasn&#39;t been around&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll be back&quot; Miyu replied &quot;He is still...&quot; But before she could 
explain she felt the presence of an evil shinma but ignored it she found 
Chisato more important. Strangely she never worried about Larva anymore 
the time when she kissed Larva would be nothing but a dear sweet memory 
to her.



An hour later 

Chisato and Miyu were fully clothed Chisato was in pink bikini whereas 
Miyu was in a red dress; they walked on the white sand beach holding 
hands. The peace made them grateful all they could hear was waves of the 
sea and the birds singing. The people around them were not glaring or 
staring at them they had no time to glare and mock lesbians they all 
simply got on with their lives.

Chisato grabbed Miyu&#39;s hand and dragged her towards the seaside. &quot;We can 
see the water better this way!&quot; Chisato said persuading.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Miyu said calmly.

Chisato suddenly realized what she was doing before she suddenly 
released Miyu&#39;s hand.

They walked along the secluded area of the beach for fifteen minutes, 
and Miyu was silent the whole way. Miyu&#39;s usual silence frustrated 
Chisato.

&quot;Why aren&#39;t you saying anything?!&quot; Chisato yelled. She didn&#39;t want her 
romantic moment to go by without Miyu saying a word.

&quot;I was just looking at the sun...&quot; Miyu blurted out, without thinking 
about how weird she sounded like to Chisato.

Chisato gasped at this statement. If she didn&#39;t know any better, Miyu 
sounded almost insightful.

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;It reminded me of something...&quot; Miyu stopped, feeling sick at the pit 
of his stomach. She had no idea what the sun reminded him of she only 
felt a positive feelings swirling around her.

&quot;What did it remind you of?&quot; Chisato asked, confused at Miyu&#39;s look of 
seriousness.

&quot;You.&quot; Miyu said quietly in a tone that left Chisato feeling flattered 
and no room for further words for a conversation.

Chisato sighed as she started walking again.

The waves became louder and louder, and the air started to grow colder 
and colder.

&quot;Let&#39;s turn back...&quot; Chisato suggested. Her hand shook. She wanted to 
feel the warmth of Miyu&#39;s hand in the coldness.

Miyu&#39;s golden eyes were lost in thought, but she barely nodded and 
turned around.

Chisato slowly caught up with her and grabbed the hand of Miyu

&quot;Miyu&quot; cried the voice of Shiina &quot;There&#39;s a shinma on the loose&quot;

&quot;I gotta go&quot; Miyu said hastily to Chisato letting go off one of her 
hands.

&quot;Go where?&quot; Chisato asked, &quot;Let me come with you&quot;

&quot;No&quot; Miyu barked then changed her tone &quot;I mean I don&#39;t you to get hurt&quot; 
Miyu then grabbed Chisato&#39;s hand again &quot;and I know one thing that I need 
to boost my confidence&quot;

&quot;What would that be Miyu?&quot; Chisato questioned

&quot;A kiss&quot; Miyu replied dropping her head on Chisato&#39;s shoulder

&quot;I&#39;ll only kiss you&quot; Chisato replied &quot;If you let me come with you&quot;

&quot;Okay, you can come with me&quot; Miyu said as she felt Chisato&#39;s lips 
claiming hers.

&quot;Come on Miyu&quot; Shiina squealed

The kiss broke and Miyu ran holding Chisato&#39;s hand to find the shinma 
but they needn&#39;t bother as they felt a sudden fierce sandstorm that 
nearly swifted the couple apart.

&quot;Here it is&quot; Shiina squealed &quot;The shinma Agatha &quot;

Miyu first checked the shivered Chisato if she was okay in their hug 
Chisato nodded and remained close to Miyu as they came across the 
shinma. The shinma appeared as a tall old woman with dark black hair and 
a black dress to match with it and red sequins to represent the devil 
ship she works for.

&quot;So it&#39;s true,&quot; Agatha declared, &quot;what Reiha said,&quot; Agatha the shinma 
examined the girls&#39; closeness &quot;The guardian is a lesbian&quot;

Chisato felt offended Miyu felt Chisato&#39;s anger by her vibrating hand 
she realised reluctantly. &quot;Do you have a problem with that Shinma?&quot; Miyu 
asked

&quot;Well it&#39;s different&quot; Agatha croaked &quot;You&#39;re probably the first lesbian 
guardian&quot; she stated &quot;I am very glad to meet you yet it will be such a 
shame that I have to kill you&quot; Agatha realised a whole sandstorm that 
caused Chisato to be lifted off her feet

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato screamed &quot;help me&quot; Miyu was still on the ground, as she 
knew this trick by so many shinma before

&quot;Larva&quot; called Miyu then in about a split second Larva&#39;s arm was ready 
with his red sharp nails powerful enough to cut anything. Miyu&#39;s main 
concern was Chisato. Chisato was sobbing, as she was swifting away from 
the vampire she loved.


&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu called Chisato slowly lifted her head up and realised she 
was feeling no effects of the sandstorm now and that she felt weightless 
&quot;Grab my hand&quot; Miyu ordered Chisato tried to grab her hand but as the 
force was overwhelming she felt like she was going to fly away from 
Miyu. Chisato reached out for her hand feeling held back but luckily 
Miyu reached over and grabbed the palm of Chisato&#39;s hand and with the 
other arm grabbed Chisato&#39;s right arm

Agatha&#39;s hair locks suddenly grew unrepentantly as the hair locks got 
involved with the sandstorm and reached for Miyu&#39;s neck. The hair locks 
were around her harshly.

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato screamed in worry. Though the worry was short lived when 
Chisato saw waves of black hair scattered around. Miyu reached for 
Larva&#39;s arm to get her and Chisato out of the sand storm.

Agatha was angered when the sandstorm subsided. &quot;I HATE LESBIANS&quot; Agatha 
screamed as she tried to realise another sand storm but was intercepted 
by Larva&#39;s nail slicing her head off with ease a splash of blood and a 
flying head stained the white sand. Chisato witnessed the flame out of 
Miyu&#39;s hand ready to burn Agatha.

&quot;Into the darkness stray shinma&quot; Miyu declared before realising the 
flame that would burn the beheaded Agatha into black ashes leaving a 
black smoke. &quot;Another shinma sealed up&quot; Miyu stated &quot;And I&#39;ve had no 
blood in ages&quot;

&quot;Miyu&quot; Larva said approaching his mistress &quot; Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m feeling fine but I&#39;ve lost my hunger for blood&quot; Miyu confessed

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato spoke &quot;Do you want any blood&quot; Miyu turned her attention 
of Larva then holded Chisato&#39;s hand &quot;Nothing matters as long as I have 
you all around me&quot;

Larva left silently. Shiina jumped on Miyu&#39;s shoulder

&quot;So what&#39;s been going on lately?&quot; Shiina asked &quot;I heard noises in the 
bathroom this morning Miyu put all the soap foam in the bath am I right 
Chisato&quot;

&quot;How did you know?&quot; Chisato asked &quot;wait a minute you weren&#39;t in the 
bathroom too...&quot; Chisato was silenced by Miyu&#39;s finger

&quot;Shiina&#39;s too noisy for her own good&quot; Miyu said

&quot;I thought we were on the same side&quot; Shiina complained, &quot;I have a very 
good eye&quot;

&quot;To be noisy with&quot; Miyu whispered to Chisato

&quot;Hey I heard that&quot; Shiina barked

Chisato was laughing a little along with a pink blush when Miyu placed 
her arm around Chisato and dragged her near to her waist.

&quot;Miyu, is that the kinda destiny you have to follow&quot;

&quot;Yes it is&quot; Miyu replied &quot;That&#39;s why I still have to be with Larva we 
share the same blood&quot;

&quot;Same blood?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;It&#39;s a bit confusing&quot; Miyu stated &quot;I&#39;ll tell you tonight. You, Larva 
and Shiina are my only friends in the world&quot;

&quot;Sometimes the lines between friends and lovers is not all that clear&quot; 
Chisato confirmed

Miyu placed her right hand on the side of Chisato&#39;s neck and glided her 
hand up to her cheek. Chisato placed her left hand over Miyu&#39;s lightly 
and looks into Miyu&#39;s eyes lovingly. Miyu does the same as she lowers 
her head to Chisato&#39;s and there lips meet in a soft kiss. Their lips 
part a few moments later.

&quot;There&#39;s another Shinma&quot; Miyu said &quot;I have to seal that shinma up&quot; Miyu 
bowed down to kiss Chisato&#39;s hand &quot;I&#39;ll be back home soon take care of 
yourself&quot;

Miyu whispered Miyu&#39;s arms shot out, closing the distance between her 
and Chisato, and held on tight to the front of her school dress. She 
brought Chisato&#39;s head down to hers in one quick motion, and claimed her 
lips to her own. Miyu&#39;s lips felt like flower petals against Chisato&#39;s. 
These sensations made her want to kiss Miyu back so badly. Instead she 
roamed into her browns eyes that were slowly turning golden. Their palms 
grew flat on eachother them Miyu&#39;s fingers fell into the gaps of Chisato 
fingers. Then they both eventually holded hands gracefully.

&quot;Miyu&quot; Larva&#39;s voice called &quot;The shinma has abducted three humans&quot;

&quot;See you tonight&quot; Miyu whispered to Chisato

&quot;Bye&quot; Chisato replied Miyu left a short kiss on the cheek for Chisato 
then slowly realised her hand then left with Larva to seal the shinma 
up.



Where was Miyu? The vampire princess should have been home hours ago and 
she didn&#39;t even call. Chisato wondered if something was wrong with Larva 
that was probably the reason why Miyu was not home yet. She knew for a 
fact that Miyu and Larva were very close and bounded by blood. Chisato 
rolled around and faced Miyu&#39;s side of the bed and she could almost 
smell that fresh, musk scent she carried. She just hoped that Miyu would 
be home soon. 

-

After dealing with three shinma in one day Miyu was tired Miyu sat down 
next to Chisato, on Chisato&#39;s side of the bed, and ran fingers through 
Chisato&#39;s soft hair. She was a sight to look at even when she was 
sleeping. Leaning forward she planted kisses on her lover&#39;s neck and 
upper back. Chisato&#39;s chocolate, brown eyes fluttered open and an &quot;Mmm&quot; 
sound escaped her lips.

&quot;You&#39;re home,&quot; she whispered.

&quot;I am,&quot; Miyu replied as she continued with her kisses.

&quot;I was waiting for you.&quot;

&quot;I know. I&#39;m sorry. I had another surprise shinma to take. Kept me back 
a while.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re here now.&quot;

&quot;Finally I&#39;ve found true happiness,&quot; Miyu thought as she joined Chisato 
in bed with her.
