<h1>Grey Love (part 4 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../vampire/index.html">Vampire Princess Miyu</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../vampire/greylove-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Miyu and Chisato woke up in Chisato&#39;s empty house. They both smiled at 
eachother peacefully.

Chisato then jumped on Miyu. Their bodies exposed as Chisato had a dildo 
in her hands inserting in herself.

Chisato then reached over and kissed Miyu

&quot;Oh please, lover,&quot; Miyu announced as she reached behind her, touching 
Chisato&#39;s her nude body with her fingertips. &quot;Aren&#39;t you tired yet?&quot;

Chisato blinked. &quot;Are you?&quot;

She nodded, smiling faintly and raising her head to kiss Chisato&#39;s lips. 
Her head fell back down after being forced by Chisato&#39;s. Keeping their 
lips locked in a deep kiss, pain and pleasure filled her ears. Then Miyu 
started to bleed a little She froze, Chisato was afraid that she had 
hurt Miyu too much.

Breaking the kiss, she looked at her, his eyes wide with worry. &quot;Did I 
hurt you? Should I stop?&quot;

Miyu shook her head wildly, hugging Chisato closer and rejoining their 
mouths. Chisato began to move the dildo in and out of Miyu, slowly at 
first, and then increasing in speed as her moans grew louder. Their kiss 
was soon broken again as Miyu lifted her body up some, Miyu&#39;s lips next 
to Chisato&#39;s ear to give her each and every pleasure-filled moan 
directly into her.

&quot;I&#39;m loving this&quot; Groaned Chisato

Miyu remained silent and without even thinking about what she was saying 
she said, &quot;So am I&quot;

Chisato shivered at the pleasure she felt as Miyu tightened her grip on 
her. Miyu softly pressed harder on her lips as Chisato untied her 
ponytail. Feeling the chocolate brown hair made her feel a strange 
relief. She felt Miyu&#39;s finger getting tangled in her own hair, which 
also made her shiver slightly.

Miyu enjoyed the way Chisato taste. She tasted kind of like a sweet 
black berry and she enjoyed it a lot. She softly asked Chisato for 
entrance as she complied. Feeling so nice and feeling kind of fuzzy at 
once. She soon dominated over Chisato&#39;s mouth as Chisato let her fingers 
grace the back of her neck causing goose bumps to rise.

Miyu was a bit surprised when Chisato wrapped her arms around her neck. 
She soon followed by wrapping her arms around her thin waist. The two 
were moving closer to one another, but Chisato quickly engulfed Miyu&#39;s 
lips in a kiss.

Miyu pulled away, panting for air as for Chisato. The two seemed a bit 
embarrassed, but also very happy. Miyu smiled as she gave Chisato a 
little kiss on her lips. Miyu then kissed her ear causing Chisato to 
giggle. Miyu and Chisato got out of bed.

They continued to kiss and rub their bodies. Chisato pushed Miyu down on 
the floor and started to rub Miyu&#39;s breast. She began sucking and 
nibbling the right nipple as she tweaked the left. Miyu moaned in 
pleasure as she rubbed Chisato&#39;s breasts.

Chisato lowered her had to Miyu&#39;s pussy and stuck her tongue in into 
Miyu&#39;s entrance. &quot;Oh, Chisato!&quot; she moaned as Chisato soon stuck two 
fingers and began pumping. They both intertwined their legs together and 
rubbed their pussy together.

Miyu yelled in pleasure and pain. Which was heard by a passing by Shiina

&quot;MIYU!&quot; cried the voice of Shiina &quot;are you... gross?&quot; Shiina shouted out 
in disgust.

&quot;What are you doing Miyu?&quot; Shiina called out jumping on Chisato and 
trying to pull away.

&quot;Shiina&quot; Miyu called out &quot;it&#39;s ok. We were just making love&quot;

&quot;OH&quot; Shiina replied &quot;sorry&quot; silence &quot;do I go then&quot;

&quot;Yes I think that&#39;s a good idea&quot; Miyu replied

Shiina walked away.

THAT EVENING

Miyu sat pensively near a lake. As Chisato was dancing about happily in 
the lake. Instead of thinking of Chisato she thought of Larva.

She hadn&#39;t seen Larva for a week. She knew that Larva was very concerned 
for Miyu a lot. And this is not exaggeration.

Chisato did betray Miyu. No doubt about that. However she&#39;s changed. Or 
has she?

The last thing that Larva wanted was Miyu to get hurt

Eventually she will have to make the decision between her loyal and 
trustworthy servant Larva the only one who can understand her, or her 
nymphomaniac lover Chisato whom betrayed her before however she was very 
close to.

The question was when?

Does she have to make her mind up now?

As she reflected she ignored a single tear that fell on her cheek. The 
first time she had actually ever properly cried.

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato said calmly &quot;why are you crying?&quot;

Miyu looked up at Chisato and smiled &quot;tears of joy&quot; she lied.

Meanwhile Larva had a terrible nightmare involving Miyu.

Chisato and Miyu were covered in blood. Drenched in it. Miyu was calling 
out his name for help but he froze. He didn&#39;t move. He watched as Shiina 
helplessly tried to save Miyu.

As he remained petrified he saw Chisato and Miyu&#39;s faces were begging to 
blur as blood continued to spill.

He screamed and realised he wasn&#39;t in the bloody scene anymore. He was 
in a grave yard.

Miyu and Chisato wrapped in eachother&#39;s arms covered in blood.

Larva woke up in a shock. His mask slid off.

He was now scared. All the concerns for Miyu have increased 
dramatically.

Amazing what one nightmare can do
