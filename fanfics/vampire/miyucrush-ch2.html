<h1>Miyu's Crush (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../vampire/index.html">Vampire Princess Miyu</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../vampire/miyucrush-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Reiha hated Miyu with a pure sheer passion; she believed that Miyu was 
responsible for stealing her limelight. The pure white raven haired girl 
could never forgive Miyu after her own father favoured her over his own 
daughter. She never knew the love of the mother, and Miyu had but lost 
it. Miyu always seemed to have had everything, whilst she was left with 
nothing. Only the possessed doll Matsukaze as her protector and the 
power to control ice and snow that she had inherited by her deceased 
mother.

Now Miyu had claimed to have found love. Her green eyes remained cold 
and dry. She would never shed a tear for that girl. Her hatred and envy 
for the girl was too strong. As she saw the site from the window of Miyu 
and this girl, she felt sick. Everything she wanted, Miyu always seemed 
to have, or either take it away from her. Reiha was very well aware that 
it would have been the first lesbian Guardian. It wasn&#39;t acceptable for 
her, she felt that she should be guardian, not a dyke like Miyu.

Of course, Miyu could have very easily have been bisexual. She had 
always shared a strong bond with Larva since day one. Maybe more lesbian 
than straight, after all most of the people she sucked blood on where 
girls. Reiha decided her sexual orientation didn&#39;t matter. She is what 
she is. She might not have been in love at all. She could have very 
easily acted like that. &#39;It could easily be a false human emotion.&#39;

&quot;So this is where Miyu has been tonight?&quot; Reiha asked sarcastically as 
she watched over Chisato&#39;s window. &quot;She seems very cosy and happy with 
that girl.&quot;

&quot;This must be the girl she loves,&quot; Matsukaze sneered as he stared in 
disgust. &quot;In a very close position, how greedy of the guardian to do 
such a thing like fall in love with a human.&quot;

&quot;Miyu should be very grateful that we had to get rid of other Shimna on 
her behalf.&quot; Reiha stated. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t have done it as quickly as us. 
She&#39;s too attached to this girl.&quot;

&quot;What are you planning to do Reiha?&quot; Matsukaze asked the snow witch. &quot;I 
know you have a desire to remove Miyu as her role of guardian. You said 
you had a plan? What is the plan?&quot;

&quot;I need to think it out much more clearly first though.&quot; Reiha said as 
they carefully and kindly cradled the possessed doll, Matsukaze. &quot;It 
involves getting Miyu into a very difficult situation.&quot;

&quot;She is already in a difficult situation as it is,&quot; The possessed doll 
stated coldly. &quot;Miyu has made her bed, now she must lie on it!&quot;

&quot;An even harder one.&quot; Reiha stated, &quot;As soon as I am satisfied that 
Miyu&#39;s feelings for this girl are true, I&#39;m fight with her. If she 
loses, I&#39;ll freeze both her and the girl, if she wins, I&#39;ll give her the 
choice... Either her role as Guardian or the life of the girl.&quot;

&quot;A very excellent plan Reiha,&quot; Matsukaze announced. &quot;Though you should 
just freeze them both anyway.&quot;

&quot;Patience Matsukaze, the plan will occur when I believe that Miyu truly 
loves her. She could very easily be lusting over her. Vampires of her 
kind usually do.&quot;

&quot;I hope this is worth the wait,&quot; Matsukaze smirked as they both vanished 
into thin air.

Miyu woke up to the sound Shiina yawning loudly. She found Chisato&#39;s 
hair rustling against her cheek and her body below her; she was close to 
her, in a way she had never been close to her before. A physical 
closeness had increased the emotional closeness to he innocent Chisato. 
Miyu felted privileged to have found herself in a position, which she 
was able to have a full close up on her state of slumber. She used her 
chocolate brown eyes to stare at her, and stare continually. Miyu 
delightfully stroked her cheek, as she smiled genuinely.

&quot;If you like her so much Miyu,&quot; Shiina told her as she jumped onto 
Miyu&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Why don&#39;t you ask her out right now!&quot;

&quot;I already told you,&quot; Miyu sighed as her eyes remained locked into 
Chisato. &quot;I will alert her about my feelings in my own time.&quot;

&quot;This is the perfect opportunity to confess it!&quot; Shiina squealed. &quot;This 
is the right time... oh boy, you never listen to me, if it was Larva 
speaking you&#39;d listen to him straight away.&quot;

&quot;Well, Larva respects my choices and opinions.&quot; Miyu announced as she 
placed the pink rabbit of her head.

&quot;I mean you two were very cosy together last night!&quot; Shiina stated as 
jumped up and down, feeling she wasn&#39;t getting enough attention. &quot;I&#39;m 
surprised you didn&#39;t kiss her. You should have though.&quot;

&quot;Feelings like these take time to develop and to find to right time is 
difficult.&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Shiina sighed. &quot;Don&#39;t blame me if you don&#39;t get to be with 
Chisato!&quot;

&quot;H-Hey...&quot; The soft voice of Chisato spoke as she quickly yawned and 
stretched her arms. &quot;Morning.&quot;

&quot;Morning Chisato,&quot; Miyu said as she sat up with Chisato. &quot;Had a nice 
sleep?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; The honey haired girl replied covering another yawn with her 
hand. &quot;Shiina woke me up with her jumping.&quot;

&quot;Oh sorry about her,&quot; Miyu said as she looked at Shiina.

&quot;Hey Chisato!&quot; Shiina called as she jumped onto Chisato&#39;s head. &quot;Can I 
see your friends at school?&quot;

&quot;Sure you can,&quot; Chisato replied as she tapped on to her pink ear waving 
around. &quot;Yukari and Hisae will like you.&quot;

&quot;Yay!&quot; Shiina looked very happy as she bowed down to Chisato. &quot;I&#39;m going 
to look around your house ok.&quot; Shiina skipped her way out of the room as 
happy as cam be.

Miyu removed herself from the bed and decided she needed to see Larva. 
He would have bound to have found out anyway. &quot;Hey Miyu, where are you 
going?&quot; Chisato asked.

&quot;I&#39;m going to the bathroom,&quot; Lied Miyu as she walked out of the room and 
made her way privately into the bathroom. She locked the door and her 
knees dropped to the floor as her head faced the floor. She still felt 
the memories of Chisato&#39;s scent, along with her eyes, her touch and her 
voice that echoed in her mind. She was lost in Chisato&#39;s charm and her 
emotions flew all over the place. She was wondering if she was even 
worthy to call for Larva at all. &quot;Is it really that bad, for the 
guardian to be in love?&quot; She asked herself whilst she held the 
friendship charm that her and Chisato shared in her hand. &quot;Is it so 
wrong to love this girl so much, I&#39;d die for her?&quot; She held onto the 
silver charm tightly into her hand as she clenched onto it. &quot;These 
forbidden feelings... why is it so wrong? Am I able to have her?&quot; She 
suddenly paused all of her movements as she thought of Larva&#39;s warning. 
He was right. &quot;You were right Larva... I know I shouldn&#39;t have gotten 
close to her, but I love her so much.&quot;

&quot;Miyu...&quot; A male voice behind her spoke as she found herself wrapped by 
dark cloaks and red nails stroking her delicately. &quot;No matter what 
happens, I will always be here by your side. Even if she&#39;s not.&quot; Miyu 
felt her protector&#39;s words as she fell onto him as she opened her eyes. 
To the red clouds and skinny trees with bright balls on top of them, 
almost like a Christmas tree without it&#39;s green bushes. &quot;How long have 
you felt this way for this girl?&quot; Larva asked curiously as he wrapped 
Miyu around his arms as his face was concealed in a cold white mask.

&quot;About two months now since that Shimna scared Chisato,&quot; Miyu admitted. 
&quot;I just grew hungry for her closeness. Chisato was sweet, I can&#39;t 
compare to anything. She&#39;s like...&quot; Miyu paused for her words, she 
didn&#39;t have any idea what to say. &quot;I can&#39;t put it into words. I just 
love her and want to protect her.&quot; Miyu faced Larva, having a feeling he 
wasn&#39;t liking what he was hearing. &quot;I know what you&#39;re going to say 
Larva, I shouldn&#39;t get too close to her, I should concentrate on getting 
rid of the shimna.&quot;

&quot;I said it before, I want you to hear it again&quot; Larva replied. &quot;This is 
the reason why you shouldn&#39;t get too close with Chisato; you&#39;re getting 
hurt in the process. However, it&#39;s your choice, and I have to respect 
that.&quot;

&quot;Shiina&#39;s been pestering me to ask her out, I just don&#39;t feel ready to 
ask her out yet. I don&#39;t want to lose Chisato.&quot; Miyu knew that she could 
always rely on Larva.

&quot;A pretty wise decision, and when you feel the time is right,&quot; Larva 
told her. &quot;I&#39;d be more than willing to help. Just tell her the truth on 
how you feel, but I can&#39;t guarantee you two would last long as a couple. 
Only time can tell that!&quot;

&quot;Thanks for your help Larva.&quot; Miyu smiled in relief. &quot;I feel a lot 
better, I better go back to Chisato.&quot;

Larva and her red world vanished and she returned to Chisato&#39;s house 
again. She opened the door and saw Chisato in front of her. &quot;Hey Miyu!&quot; 
Chisato cheered as she leaned close to Miyu&#39;s shoulder as she grabbed 
her arm. &quot;I made breakfast for you, it&#39;s on the table downstairs. It&#39;s 
yogurt with nuts and fruits in.&quot;

&quot;Sounds lovely,&quot; Miyu said smiling as she allowed Chisato to drag her 
down the stairs. As they reached the bottom of the stares, she saw the 
bowl ready for her. Chisato pushed the chair out for her and placed a 
bright comfortable looking cushion on the chair nearest to the bowl. 
&quot;Here&#39;s your seat Miyu, I&#39;ve made it comfortable for you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Miyu said as she sat down. Chisato quickly giggled as she 
placed got her own bowl and sat near the left side of Miyu.

&quot;Nice place you have here!&quot; The pink beast announced as bounced on the 
table watching the girls enjoy their breakfast. &quot;I&#39;m sure Miyu will 
enjoy her stay here, especially with a lovely girl like you Chisato, I 
used to think having human friends are weird, but now I think it&#39;s cool. 
You two would make a very nice couple.a

The girls looked at Shiina, they were both trying hard not to blush. 
Miyu&#39;s face was slightly pink, but when she looked at Chisato, she was 
blushing even harder. Chisato was starting to become speechless without 
any idea what to say next. Miyu saw that her words were stuck in her 
throat, and she found it cute. &quot;Anyway,&quot; Chisato screeched. &quot;I packed 
all your school stuff for you Miyu, I gave you lunch as well, all you 
seem to have is tomato juice.&quot; Miyu thought that Chisato was too kind 
for her own good. Her cuteness and kindness made a brilliant 
combination. &quot;And I&#39;ve got some carrots and marshmallows for Shiina. We 
need to save some for Yukari and Hisae though.&quot; Chisato stroked the pink 
rabbit as she spoke ticking her floppy ears.

&quot;Shiina&#39;s also fond of cabbage.&quot; Miyu announced after tucking into her 
food with manners fit for a queen.

&quot;EWW!&quot; Shiina moaned. &quot;You hate I hate cabbage Miyu,&quot; She turned over to 
look at Chisato. &quot;She enjoys irritating me.&quot; Chisato simply giggled as 
she carried Shiina in her arms again.

&quot;I have a feeling this is going to be great!&quot; Chisato announced as she 
lifted Shiina up in the air.

&quot;&quot;I agree...&quot; Miyu said as she looking into the happy state that Chisato 
was in. Her huge fun smile, had made her smile too. This was going to be 
a good day.
