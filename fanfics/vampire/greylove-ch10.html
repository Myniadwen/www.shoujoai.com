A/N: Chapter 10 is here taken time of vengeful lovers to add another 
chapter to this fic and i don&#39;t know how to end it. But this is part one 
of the trilogy so it has to be a good start

Chisato threw herself on the sofa feeling the smooth leather skin on her 
back. Glaring at the television to see what was on she didn&#39;t understand 
it because it was in Spanish but she knew a little bit of Spanish. She 
would have known more if she paid attention in class. She got up bored 
to death. Where was Miyu? She wasn&#39;t up to something bad. Chisato hoped 
she was OK dealing with the shinma as she opened the door of the kitchen 
to help herself for some breakfast. Chisato sighed, Miyu forgot to take 
the clothes out of the washing machine, Chisato ignored it though 
reaching out for the box of cereal and placing it on the table grabbed a 
bowl from behind her. Chisato opened the fridge door as the light of the 
fridge shined at her. Chisato grabbed the bottle of milk then shut the 
door shunning the fridge light. Chisato poured the box into the bowl. 
Grains had flooded the bowl Chisato returned the box back to its place. 
After that she drowned the grains with the white liquid. Chisato then 
returned the milk to the cold cupboard named a fridge.

Chisato collapsed on the chair staring at the cereal knowing that she 
had forgotten something. A spoon Chisato, on two legs of her chair 
grabbed two spoons from the drawer. She had no idea why she wanted two 
but it was for the pure sake of it. She could have eaten now. She was 
asking herself why was she not eating it? It would have been a waste of 
time to get the cereal ready. She had to admit the bowl was pretty huge 
when she took a bowl at random.

Chisato heard a door sound go wide open it a high pitch sound then close 
in a low pitched squeak with a medium bang on the door. She heard 
footsteps on the ground they were faint but gradually getting louder. 
Then a voice &quot;Chisato-chan! Chisato-chan!&quot; Chisato trusted the voice she 
heard &quot;Here Miyu&quot; Chisato called out &quot;In the kitchen&quot; The door of the 
kitchen opened as Miyu entered the room she went over to the curtain and 
divorced them giving out some light. With some light Miyu sat down to 
the chair of the table closest to Chisato. &quot;You&#39;re up early Chisato&quot; 
Miyu pointed out grabbing the spoon and tucking into the cereal. &quot;Where 
have you been this morning?&quot; Chisato asked. Miyu was silent.

&quot;Oh another shinma showed up&quot; Miyu replied &quot;But we managed to seal it 
up&quot;. Chisato looked into Miyu in faint suspiction weather what she said 
was true or she was being unfaithful and having an affair with Larva 
would be a great question but was not her concern at this time. She was 
just glad that Miyu was home. Chisato began tucking in to the cereal now 
tasting the sweetness of the grains. She was a bit awkward sharing her 
breakfast with Miyu and thought it was quite ridiculous. Eventually 
Chisato smiled and looked at Miyu. She should be feeling glad that Miyu 
shared her breakfast. Chisato then noticed Miyu&#39;s arm was in a bandage.

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato exclaimed holding Miyu&#39;s arm out towards her. &quot;How did 
you get that?&quot; She asked obviously panicking. Miyu was still calm 
despite the nasty bruise.

&quot; Nothing it just got sprained&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;Nothing!?&quot; Chisato asked &quot;You called spraining your arm nothing&quot;

&quot;Just a little&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;Then why is it in a bandage &#39;if it&#39;s just a little&#39;?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;Don&#39;t know&quot; Miyu relied &quot;Just in case it was worse than I thought&quot; Miyu 
had a strange face

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato thought, &quot;Are you Ok?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m fine&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;You don&#39;t look fine&quot; Chisato replied as she reached over to touch her 
forehead and felt the hot heat absorbed on Miyu&#39;s forehead &quot;You&#39;re 
really hot? Have you got a fever?&quot;

&quot;Chisato I&#39;m fine&quot; Miyu stated but inside she finally understood why she 
was feeling hot and stressed. She had spent three whole months with out 
sucking blood. Miyu&#39;s heatness increased. Chisato even more concerned as 
Miyu eyes closed as her face imploded on Chisato&#39;s lap.

&quot;MIYU!&quot; Chisato screamed &quot;Wake up!&quot; Chisato was shaking Miyu not knowing 
were to go. Chisato felt the tears in her eyes. &quot;Mi.. Miyu&quot; Chisato 
sobbed thinking she was dead. She was a vampire and she collapsed of 
starvation.

Flashback

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu called Chisato slowly lifted her head up and realised she 
was feeling no effects of the sandstorm now and that she felt weightless 
&quot;Grab my hand&quot; Miyu ordered Chisato tried to grab her hand but as the 
force was overwhelming she felt like she was going to fly away from 
Miyu. Chisato reached out for her hand feeling held back but luckily 
Miyu reached over and grabbed the palm of Chisato&#39;s hand and with the 
other arm grabbed Chisato&#39;s right arm

Agatha&#39;s hair locks suddenly grew unrepentantly as the hair locks got 
involved with the sandstorm and reached for Miyu&#39;s neck. The hair locks 
were around her harshly.

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato screamed in worry. Though the worry was short lived when 
Chisato saw waves of black hair scattered around. Miyu reached for 
Larva&#39;s arm to get her and Chisato out of the sand storm.

&quot;Miyu&quot; Larva said approaching his mistress &quot; Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m feeling fine but I&#39;ve lost my hunger for blood&quot; Miyu confessed

&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato spoke &quot;Do you want any blood&quot; Miyu turned her attention 
of Larva then holded Chisato&#39;s hand &quot;Nothing matters as long as I have 
you all around me&quot;

End of flashback

Chisato reached down over Miyu. &quot;Miyu please come back&quot; Chisato 
implored. Chisato kissed Miyu&#39;s hot cheek. Chisato got up tried to 
breathe when she saw Larva appear from nowhere

&quot;Miyu&quot; Larva cried as he grabbed Miyu to his arms cheeking her 
breathing. He looked directly at Chisato as if she had murdered Miyu 
&quot;What have you done to her?&quot; Larva snapped with his red nails

&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything&quot; Chisato cried &quot;She just collapsed outta nowhere&quot; 
Chisato was still crying as she took Miyu off Larva hugging her 
violently. Chisato felt slight movements. She first thought it was Larva 
trying to take Miyu off her. Chisato stopped crying and heard feminine 
breaths. If she had stopped whining she would have heard it ages ago. 
&quot;Miyu&quot; Chisato whispered as she had Miyu in her arms. She saw Miyu&#39;s 
faint eyes movements. Chisato brought Miyu closer to her. Chisato closed 
her eyes. Glad that Miyu wasn&#39;t going to die.

&quot;She hasn&#39;t had any blood in ages&quot; Larva stated, &quot;she collapsed because 
of that&quot; Larva said it as if he knew exactly what he was talking about.

&quot;Should I call a doctor?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;No&quot; Larva confirmed, &quot;once she&#39;s tasted blood she&#39;ll be ok&quot;

Chisato patted Miyu&#39;s back, hoping that what Larva said is true. Chisato 
felt the head move upwards and a quick bite on her neck. It caused her 
eyes to widen. She remembered the last time she was bit by Miyu. It felt 
like a blood test, Miyu felt different blood tastes about three or five 
it was probably the sword Chisato used to kill Hisae, Yukari and her 
parents. Miyu stopped knowing what she was doing. She had to leave some 
blood for her to live on.

&quot;You feeling better Miyu&quot; Chisato asked

Miyu nodded not finding the words to speak.

&quot;Don&#39;t scare me like that&quot; Chisato screamed with laughter &quot;I thought you 
were dead&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t die&quot; Miyu replied to her &quot;You should now that&quot;

&quot;I remember&quot; Chisato whispered sought comfort in the vampire princess.

&quot;See you tonight Miyu&quot; Larva called

&quot;See you tonight Larva&quot; Miyu replied facing Larva then he disappeared.

The pink-rabbit like beast jumped on the table. &quot;Hey what&#39;s going on?&quot; 
Shiina asked, &quot;I can&#39;t get no sleep&quot; she complained

&quot;Maybe you should try sleeping earlier Shiina&quot; Miyu told her

&quot;Maybe you should cut out the sex&quot; Shiina snapped &quot;Like just now&quot;

Miyu left a short-term smirk. Shiina jumped onto Miyu&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Hey&quot; 
Shiina hissed to Chisato &quot;What ya gonna do tonight&quot;

&quot;Well&quot; Chisato started &quot;I was going to cover Miyu in..&quot; Miyu placed her 
hand over Chisato&#39;s mouth

&quot;None of your business Shiina&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;Aaw&quot; Shiina complained, &quot;I wanna know your sex life. You would tell 
Larva but not me&quot; Shiina jumped away from Miyu. As Shiina left Miyu took 
her hand away from Chisato. &quot;So what were you going to cover me in?&quot;

Chisato blushed &quot;It&#39;s kinda embarrassing&quot; She admitted &quot;I wanted to 
cover you in chocolate sauce and cream&quot; Chisato smiled and giggled Miyu 
smiled.

&quot;Chocolate and cream&quot; Shiina thought out aloud but being nosy at the 
same time &quot;Seems like you two are gonna have some fun tonight&quot;

&quot;Shiina&quot; Miyu hissed, &quot;Do you want me to burn you&quot;

&quot;No&quot; Shiina said hastily then left.

&quot;Shiina is really funny&quot; Chisato giggled.

&quot;Anyway&quot; Miyu said stroking Chisato&#39;s hair &quot;About covering me in 
Chocolate and Cream?&quot;

&quot;What would you cover me in&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;Don&#39;t ask me that &quot; Miyu cringed &quot;Mines really bad&quot;

&quot;Come on&quot; Chisato persuaded dragging Miyu to her.

&quot;Blood and Ice&quot; Miyu whispered faintly so that Chisato couldn&#39;t hear

&quot;Sorry I didn&#39;t hear that&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t make me say it again... OK Blood and Ice&quot;

Chisato had a face of shock on her face. &quot;Miyu you are so weird&quot; Chisato 
exclaimed &quot;Blood and Ice. Oh yeah you are a vampire though and you can 
summon flames so I guess it would be ok for you&quot;

&quot;That was the kinda intension&quot; Miyu admitted &quot;Let&#39;s not bother with 
that. Do it another time.&quot;

&quot;No sex?&quot; Chisato asked in horror

&quot;Of course we are having sex&quot; Miyu hissed &quot;The relationship would be 
boring without sex&quot;

&quot;You have a point there&quot; Chisato replied.

&quot;Wanna go out?&quot; Miyu asked &quot;To those restaurants&quot;

&quot;The restaurants?&quot; Chisato asked, &quot;Miyu, we don&#39;t speak much Spanish&quot;

&quot;You know food and drink don&#39;t you?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;Yeah I know that?&quot; Chisato asked &quot;But what if people ask us questions 
about us?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t be as homophobic,&quot; Miyu suggested

&quot;I remember Hisae telling me i some countries homosexuality and 
lesbianism is against the law.&quot; Chisato thought in concern &quot;Even 
sentence them to death&quot;

&quot;That shouldn&#39;t matter&quot; Miyu stated holding Chisato&#39;s hand &quot;As long as I 
have you I have someone to live for&quot;


I thank Demon eyes for the pm encouraging me to write new chapters to
