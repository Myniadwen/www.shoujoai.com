Chisato felt alone and devastated. Miyu had left in a hurry to France 
with Larva. It was as much as a shock for her as it was for Miyu. Not 
that Chisato was jealous of Larva or anything, but the way it happened. 
Larva dragged Miyu away from the special kiss. What was worse, she had 
no idea how long Miyu would be. How strong the shinma were or where she 
even was. Chisato was worried that Miyu would feel weakness without her 
or that they would tease, insult and put Miyu down because of her. 

&quot;Hey you seem pretty lonely&quot; A woman not in a nurse uniform but a police 
uniform proudly. She looked modest in her dark pigtails assisted with a 
brunette police officer. &quot;Hey Natsumi&quot; She called &quot;Let&#39;s talk to...&quot; She 
looked over to find her name &quot;Chisato&quot; Then she called over to the 
brunette policewoman with a short bob hairstyle who was showing off in 
front of all the children. &quot;NATSUMI!&quot; She snapped

&quot;Alright Miyuki, babe&quot; Natsumi called out &quot;Calm down love&quot;

&quot;Hey you just called her babe,&quot; One of the patients pointed out with his 
leg in a sling.

&quot;Are you a lesbian Natsumi?&quot; The female five-year-old patient next to 
him asked whilst she pointed at Miyuki who blushed

&quot;Me?&quot; Natsumi announced &quot;Do you even know what a lesbian is little 
girl?&quot;

&quot;Girl falls in love with a girl&quot; She stated &quot;I know because my mom is a 
lesbian and does incest with my aunt&quot; Natsumi got embarrassed then 
cringed her way over to Miyuki.

&quot;Stop making such a fool of yourself&quot; Miyuki told her &quot;Otherwise I&#39;ll 
have to chain you up and tease you harshly&quot;

&quot;Miyuki&quot; Natsumi whispered, &quot;There&#39;s children around here&quot;

&quot;So are you lesbians?&quot; Chisato asked curiously

The policewomen found that every one was staring at them. They nodded 
faintly. The shock faces of the young patients in the wing. It seemed 
liked Chisato was the only one in the wing that could talk to them as a 
normal people

&quot;Now&quot; Natsumi announced talking to Chisato &quot;Where&#39;s your family?&quot;

&quot;Yeah&quot; Miyuki pointed out &quot;No one has visited you yet, no family nor 
anyone. Where would they be?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re dead&quot; Chisato said in no one nor emotion

&quot;Every one you know?&quot; Miyuki asked

&quot;Well I&#39;ve got this friend Miyu&quot; Chisato stated, &quot;Who is with her 
guardian in France&quot;

&quot;In France&quot; Miyuki announced

&quot;Yeah&quot; Chisato replied &quot; She&#39;s doesn&#39;t have any idea when she&#39;ll be 
back. When she&#39;s back she&#39;s support to pick me up and take me back to 
Ibiza&quot;

&quot;Miyu certainly knows how to travel&quot; Natsumi admitted wrapping her arms 
around Miyuki playing with her pigtails.

&quot;So what did the doctors say about your toes?&quot; Miyuki calmly asked her

&quot;They said not to walk on it yet,&quot; Chisato stated &quot; I would be able to 
walk on it next week&quot;

&quot;Hey we&#39;re on vacation next week&quot; Natsumi stated &quot;In France, I was 
wondering we could take you with us if you want to &quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;Of course&quot; Natsumi replied. The expressions on her face indicated her 
pride of life.

&quot;Oh your great!&quot; Chisato exclaimed loudly &quot;thank you thank you.&quot;



Miyu had reflected on the top of Eiffel tower. She had only sealed five 
of the twenty shinma that had outburst here. The surroundings where very 
different but the view was magnificent although Miyu was all used to it, 
so it was nothing special to her. She had Chisato drowning in her head. 
Miyu was worried that Chisato would get upset and be too dependent on 
her. Miyu did have to admit, she had been feeling slightly week and 
depending on how long it would take to seal up twenty shinma she would 
be even weaker. Maybe it&#39;s because she hasn&#39;t been on blood a lot 
recently and the time when she collapsed in front of Chisato making 
Larva almost believe that Chisato had harmed Miyu again. She couldn&#39;t 
get the honey haired girl out of her head. 

Miyu felt the hand on her cold shoulder grab on to her gently. Miyu 
stared at the red nails hanging from her shoulder. Miyu turned around to 
see her loyal servant

&quot;You think about her too much&quot; Larva stated knowing what she was going 
through. He knew her so well that he could read her mind. Miyu gazed at 
the view as Larva dragged her chin with his hand&#39;s to face him. Miyu 
tried to look down thinking that she didn&#39;t deserve to look at him at 
all. She was wondering why he still loved her.

&quot;How come you don&#39;t hate me?&quot; Miyu asked Larva. Wondering why he could 
even approach her after treating him like that. Larva swifted Miyu into 
a tender stolen kiss. Miyu lowered her forehead.

&quot;I&#39;m really surprised you don&#39;t hate me,&quot; Miyu told Larva.

&quot;Why would I hate you?&quot; Larva asked Miyu throwing the question back at 
her.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you at least hurt by what I&#39;m doing?&quot; Miyu asked him grabbing 
onto the wiry cloaks. &quot;Why can&#39;t you just hate me?&quot; Miyu was throwing 
anger at herself. Realising the terrible mess she had got herself into. 
She pulled her head in her hands. Larva looked down at her. The huge 
look of sorrow on her face made Larva think that she missed Chisato. He 
knew how he was going to do. He wrapped his arms around Miyu

&quot;You really miss her don&#39;t you?&quot; Larva asked her knowing what the answer 
will be even if she did deny it so he wouldn&#39;t get upset. Miyu nodded 
resting on to Larva. She still felt unworthy to be around her faithful 
servant. Miyu was feeling her average mood. &quot;You haven&#39;t answered my 
question, why don&#39;t you hate me?&quot; Miyu was still asking her servant that 
question.

&quot;Because&quot; Larva replied &quot;I love you.&quot; Miyu reached over and kissed 
Larva. They were both on their own so they only had themselves to keep 
company. Their mouths still moving onto eachother. Miyu yet still 
thinking about Chisato cuteness just couldn&#39;t resist Larva&#39;s sexy looks. 
Miyu instantly grew dependant on him she wrapped herself around him 
gently whilst Larva was pushing her up to his level. The romantic scene 
of the Eiffel tower had dissolved into a scene of bedroom light blue 
reflecting the night sky that was visible in the French windows. Miyu 
looked up to see Larva cradling her.

As soon as Larva placed Miyu on the bed he witnessed Miyu giggle. Larva 
smiled slightly. Miyu had remembered how to laugh and how to cry. Larva 
softly claimed the side of Miyu&#39;s neck. Miyu feeling the cold tingly 
feeling of his red nails and the unexpected warm feeling of his white 
porcelain arms. Miyu then felt his arms crawling down to her purple obi. 
After feeling her obi being touched she then felt a sudden sharp shiver 
up her spine as Larva pushed Miyu towards himself. Miyu then felt 
realised now the obi that had held her clothes on was gone. Larva then 
pushed her away as her white kimono clads slip of her shoulders. Miyu 
then felt a sudden moment in guilt. She was wondering if Chisato knew 
about her present situation, how would she react to it? She knew it 
wouldn&#39;t be a good reaction. However she didn&#39;t want Larva to notice her 
feelings of guilt so she wouldn&#39;t let him down. Miyu was holding Larva 
towards her breast. She was moaning with a neutral pitch but she felt 
her teat&#39;s go hard. Then the removal of all her clothes that Larva had 
carelessly chucked away. Miyu felt nothing but goose bumps in her stolen 
bloodstream. Clouding her mind chucking at her memories that she had 
long forgotten. Miyu felt nothing but gentle fingers around her touching 
and cupping her. She heard nothing but her own moans and feelings and 
emotions that she had failed to understand she was beginning to now. She 
began to shut her eyes as the emotions felt too strong to see.

The trembling and shivering feelings and movements grew sharper as she 
felt something inside of her. She heard her own gasps. She was surprised 
that she felt no pain. She felt a whole lot of positive emotions all at 
once. Once she opened her eyes she felt an orgasm run through her. She 
opened her golden eyes only to be glared at his red eyes leading to 
kiss.



Two weeks later 

After two long weeks of a boring recovery of the foot. Chisato was 
allowed to leave the hospital and Natsumi and Miyuki were permitted to 
take her to France. Chisato had a sign of relief she was going to see 
Miyu again. Now she was in a car with another lesbian couple who were 
both kind hearted and confident.

&quot;Can you drive any faster?&quot; Chisato requested to Miyuki

&quot;Sorry Chisato!&quot; Miyuki called out &quot;Maximum speed limit&quot;.

Chisato didn&#39;t even feel the car go even fast she felt the car going 
really slow, looking at the window compared to the police car she was in 
the cars seemed to be zooming away twice the speed. As a lump of pink 
banged on the window.

&quot;Oh fucking hell!&quot; Miyuki spat out as the pink rabbit had made her 
concentration worse. Chisato leaned forward. Recognising Shiina.

&quot;Shiina!&quot; Chisato called out. &quot;Open the window&quot; Chisato ordered.

&quot;Right away!&quot; Miyuki replied, Chisato heard the windows go down and saw 
the pink beast jump into the car and sit on Chisato&#39;s lap. Shiina did 
not look very pleased. Now she had to try not to tell Chisato that Miyu 
had been cheating on her with Larva.

&quot;Hey Chisato you heard what Miyu said&quot; Shiina reacted as she jumped on 
her shoulder. &quot;Stay in Japan&quot;

&quot;I know&quot; Chisato replied &quot;I just missed her too much, so where&#39;s Miyu?&quot;

&quot;In that huge cathedral&quot; Shiina replied

&quot;What huge cathedral?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;You mean Notre Damme&quot; Natsumi replied, &quot;We&#39;ll get there as soon as 
possible&quot;

&quot;Thanks you two&quot; Chisato replied, &quot;So Shiina, how is Miyu?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s been fine&quot; Shiina said feeling the temptation of saying that Miyu 
slept with Larva to slip out from her tongue. &quot;Her and Larva...&quot; she 
almost said it. &quot;Fucking... no I mean defeating shinma as usual&quot; she 
nearly had it out.

&quot;Fucking?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;No&quot; Shiina replied &quot;that was a joke they only have five shinma left 
then &quot;

&quot;So they defeated fifteen?&quot;

&quot;You bet&quot; Shiina replied, &quot;They make a great coup- team&quot;

&quot;Cup-team?!&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;I said team&quot; Shiina replied trying to make Chisato forget about what 
she was going to say Shiina now felt bad it got revealed.

&quot;You said cup-team&quot; Chisato stated&quot; where you about to say couple?&quot;

&quot;No I wasn&#39;t at all&quot; Shiina cried, &quot;I&#39;m just having a bad day&quot;

&quot;You really make me laugh&quot; Chisato smiled.

&quot;Here we are Notre dame&quot; Miyuki replied. The car steered then the 
movements ceased. Chisato scurried out of the car slamming the door 
giving the two cops a think you before running into the cathedral.

&quot;Hey wait up!&quot; Shiina called up

Chisato ran into the cathedral the doors shut. The cathedral was all 
dark. Chisato then saw a shadow of a young woman with the figure similar 
to Miyu. Chisato then began started calling for her girlfriend Miyu

&quot;Miyu!&quot;

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu&#39;s voice called out &quot;Is that you?&quot;

&quot;Of course it&#39;s me!&quot; Chisato replied as she carelessly ran through the 
doors of famous cathedral Notre Dame just to hug Miyu. &quot;I missed you so 
much&quot; Chisato exclaimed as she tightened Miyu in a hug. The tears had 
settled on both of their eyes whilst Miyu had the most honest smile that 
Chisato had ever seen of her.

&quot;I told you not to force yourself,&quot; Miyu told her yet she was still 
happy

&quot;No time for happy reunions&quot; Reiha snapped, &quot;Get rid of those shinma&quot;

&quot;Shinma?&quot; Natsumi asked

&quot;Now that&#39;s not something you explained to us,&quot; Miyuki informed Chisato

&quot;God demons&quot; Chisato gasped &quot;No time to explain&quot; Chisato announced 
quickly whilst running with Miyu &quot;Thank you see ya later&quot;

&quot;Hey wait!&quot; Miyuki shouted as Chisato and Miyu ran up the stairs of the 
Notre Dame cathedral as she stopped to the floor to face Natsumi &quot;Kids, 
so immature&quot;

&quot;You act like a little kid yourself,&quot; Natsumi admitted as she ran over 
to her.

&quot;Well should we help them anyway?&quot; Miyuki asked

&quot;We are on vacation so we can do what we want&quot;

&quot;I say help them&quot; Miyuki shouted out Natsumi looked into her girlfriends 
eyes there was determination, courage and strength. &quot;Come on we can help 
them can&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;Mi-Miyuk- Miyuki&quot; Natsumi sobbed as she grabbed Miyuki&#39;s hand &quot;OK&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the spirit&quot; Miyuki announced &quot;Now let&#39;s kick some butt&quot;

&quot;So how many shinma are left Miyu?&quot; Chisato asked holding onto Miyu&#39;s 
hand

&quot;There&#39;s about five left&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;Oh you&#39;re still here are you?&quot; Reiha spat out at Chisato

&quot;Yes&quot; Chisato snapped back at the doll

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare say &#39;yes&#39; to Reiha in that ungrateful manner&quot; Matsukaze 
spat out &quot;You should be thankful that none of you two are dead yet.&quot;

&quot;Miyu&quot; Reiha announced, &quot;After the shinma here have been defeated, 
promise me a fight&quot; Reiha smiled all the way through her speech. She 
wanted to fight and kill Miyu. Looking at the chemistry between her and 
Chisato &quot;Such bittersweet chemistry&quot; Reiha interrupted &quot;I guess you 
won&#39;t tell her about you and Larva&quot;

&quot;They got it on,&quot; The annoying doll shouted out &quot;Why don&#39;t you admit it 
Miyu&quot;

&quot;How many times do I have to tell you that my love life is a private 
matter?&quot; Miyu demanded at the snow demon and doll.

&quot;You just won&#39;t admit it will you&quot; Reiha hissed.

&quot;You&#39;re lying&quot; Chisato snapped

&quot;Ah Shinma&quot; Reiha barked at Chisato &quot;You&#39;ve got something to say&quot;

Chisato turned around to angrily face Reiha &quot;Miyu would never cheat on 
me&quot; Reiha looked at her then laughed with Matsukaze at Miyu and Chisato. 
&quot;What is it that you find so funny?&quot;

&quot;How can you fall in love with the person who killed your brother?&quot; 
Reiha asked Chisato &quot;Your so naive,&quot; Reiha went back to gracefully 
insulting Miyu again &quot;Miyu you&#39;ve tricked her. I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve 
been so cruel.&quot;

&quot;Shut up&quot; Chisato screamed at her &quot;Shut up&quot;

&quot;Now let me give you the facts&quot; Matsukaze spat.

&quot;The facts are that you two are incredibly annoying&quot; Chisato snapped at 
them.

&quot;Hey Chisato&quot; A high pitched voice jumped on her shoulder &quot;I don&#39;t think 
it&#39;s a very good idea to insult these two&quot;

&quot;They just so fucking annoying&quot; Chisato replied to Shiina.

&quot;We have no time for arguing&quot; Miyu stated, &quot;We still have five other 
shinma to seal up.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re finally back on the subject&quot; Reiha shouted at her.

&quot;Shut up&quot; Chisato snapped at Reiha

&quot;Fine no one listens to me&quot; Shiina asked

&quot;Shiina who&#39;s the nearest shinma&quot; Miyu asked trying to look at over the 
rooftop balcony

&quot;Right where I&#39;m standing,&quot; Shiina pointed out refereeing to Chisato

&quot;This is no time for jokes,&quot; Miyu told the pink rabbit

&quot;You can&#39;t take any jokes can you?&quot; Shiina stated gutted.

&quot;Ah so you enjoy your company don&#39;t you&quot; A new cold voice had shattered 
from nowhere they all turned around five human shaped shinma&#39;s posing as 
monks had entered the atmosphere.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you just show yourself&quot; Miyu asked &quot;We all know that your not 
monks&quot;

&quot;You have sinned Miyu&quot; The middle monk stated.

&quot;I am well aware of that&quot; Miyu seethed

&quot;Your activities and adultery is disgraceful,&quot; Another monk in a 
different voice stated.

&quot;They have a point you know&quot; Matsukaze whispered to Reiha.

&quot;You should give her up now&quot; The far left monk suggested walking over to 
the lesbian guardian &quot;Homosexuality is a sin&quot; He stated &quot;But Bisexuality 
means that you are possessed by an evil spirit&quot;

&quot;She is not possessed&quot; Chisato shouted running over to hug Miyu &quot;She 
loves me I know she does&quot;

&quot;No she does not,&quot; All the five monks stated together

&quot;&quot;I do actually,&quot; Miyu snapped, &quot; We are allowed to love who ever we 
want to can&#39;t we?&quot; Miyu touched Chisato&#39;s cheek. Her love to her hadn&#39;t 
been so important.

&quot;You have been unfaithful&quot; One of the shinma monks snapped

&quot;I don&#39;t care if she is unfaithful,&quot; Chisato whispered. Miyu tried to 
push Chisato away &quot;Chisato don&#39;t get involved, I don&#39;t want to get you 
hurt&quot;

&quot;No&quot; Chisato announced

&quot;Your foot needs to recover&quot; Miyu whispered. Chisato then pulled Miyu&#39;s 
kimono clads. The clads she was used to taking off. &quot;My foot is 
perfectly fine.&quot; Chisato was rubbing her face on Miyu. &quot;You&#39;re kinda 
distracting me&quot; Miyu told her girlfriend.

&quot;Watch out Miyu&quot; Shiina. The monks waved their arms in the air. A huge 
wind had blown fiercely around them. The priests had glowed a blinding 
white. Miyu grabbed together onto Chisato yet Chisato was holding onto 
her just as tight. Even Reiha was failing to study Miyu as the blinding 
light and fierce wind was too much for her. Miyu&#39;s feet slowly skidded 
while she was still holding Chisato. When the fierce wind became cooler 
and cooler the light had become dimmer and dimmer. A windy sound had 
emerged then all the wind and light had deceased. Everything was back to 
normal. Until they saw what the priests had become

Shadows had overcome them all. Thick black scales reflecting the 
moonlight perfectly. Rough wings that looked as hard as rock boulders 
and looked as shiny as a new steal sword. The silver nails looks like 
small daggers ready to kill. Two pure blood red eyes gleaming at the 
enemy. What the monks together combined opened its mouth. Showing the 
crocodile teeth.

&quot;They&#39;ve all combined to become this dragon!&quot; Shiina shouted

&quot;Do you think my flames will still work on them?&quot; Miyu asked

&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; Shiina replied, &quot;Give it a try&quot;

&quot;Chisato get out the way,&quot; Miyu told her

&quot;No&quot; Chisato shouted, &quot;I love you&quot;. The redhead was trying to convince 
the golden eyes to fight with her. Miyu touched her cheek &quot;I love you 
too&quot; Miyu replied. The homophobic dragon let out a huge roar unleashing 
a huge wave of fire. Miyu managed to dodge it. Reiha&#39;s cruel ice was 
trying to freeze the dragon up. The dragon glared at Reiha and in ease 
knocked Reiha away along with smashing Matsukaze up.

Chisato scurried pass the flames dancing on the floor reaching over to 
grab Miyu&#39;s hand &quot;They&#39;re well strong&quot;

&quot;Yes they are&quot; Miyu replied.

&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; A voice recognised by Chisato shouted. &quot;Oh my 
god it&#39;s on fire&quot;

&quot;Natsumi!&quot; Chisato called out

&quot;Oh hello&quot; Natsumi called out &quot;We wanted to help you&quot;

The dragon glared at Miyu and was ready to grab Miyu by the fist. Miyu 
continued dodging the attacks. Chisato planned to attack from behind 
with the sword she sinned with. Chisato was nearly loosing control of 
her feet whilst at the same time not trying to be shot with Natsumi&#39;s 
bullets.

&quot;Beat that!&quot; Natsumi screeched, still shooting the dragon.

&quot;Wait&quot; Miyuki gasped holding Natsumi&#39;s gun and holding her arm around 
Natsumi&#39;s waist &quot;Watch out&quot; She told the brunette cop &quot;you could shoot 
Chisato&quot;

Chisato tried to sneak up onto then a loud bash overcoming the noise of 
the dragon a sudden bang Chisato jumped hastily beside the dragon. Then 
losing control of her feet overpowered on the toeless foot. Letting out 
a huge scream then banging chest first on the dragons tail with the 
sword in front of her. Chisato felt splashes of blood on her face and 
staining her clothes. Chisato got up and realised that she had cut off 
the dragon&#39;s tail. Chisato felt her stomach leap. She knew she was in 
deep trouble.

The dragon turned around. Five shinma in the dragon meant it was five 
times angrier than it should be. Then a bullet right in the red eyes. By 
Natsumi. The dragon cried even more moving about randomly. Chisato 
remembered her sword climbed onto the dragon&#39;s hyper back then pulled 
the sword into his back heroically. Chisato her sword absorb some of the 
blood as the blade grew red. Miyu&#39;s flame was all ready to seal up the 
five shinma. The back of the dragon was an earthquake, Chisato slid of 
landing on her back then rolling three times. She felt the sudden pain 
in her foot again.

The sharp claws of the dragon turned around then caught a black pigtail 
with its claw. Hanging Miyuki with the fierce claw by the hair leaving 
Miyuki to let out a huge scream. &quot;MIYUKI!&quot; Natsumi screamed in panic yet 
Natsumi was still confident either way that she would save Miyuki. She 
ran out to attempt to save Miyuki with her hands. Trying to distract the 
flamboyant dragon. A fierce movement in wind violently pushed Natsumi 
away; thankfully Natsumi&#39;s tight grip on Miyuki was enough to escape the 
grip of the shinma dragon. Then banging hard on the wall.

&quot;Miyuki&quot; Chisato cried out &quot;Natsumi&quot; it was no time to grieve over them 
whilst the dragon then sneered around over to Miyu crawling over to her. 
Chisato found this the perfect opportunity to reclaim her sword from the 
dragon&#39;s back whilst it tried to attack Miyu. Chisato didn&#39;t even notice 
that Larva had arrived. Chisato saw the blood oozing from the dragon&#39;s 
back she nearly slipped on it. Chisato flew over to reach the handle of 
the sword. Chisato&#39;s stomach jumped as she was flying around. Chisato 
then looked up as she saw the dragon have no head. She then looked up to 
see the sharp red nails that had beheaded her once before. Chisato 
pulled her sword out then rolling over on the floor. Chisato tensely 
grabbed the sword running in front of Miyu aiming at the dragon&#39;s chest. 
For support of jumping high Chisato placed her sword down powering her 
jump up then leaping on both of her feet then aiming at the cold chest 
of the dragon. Chisato&#39;s finger slipped making her fall on the ground. 
Chisato felt the sudden bang on her knees. She most likely had tried too 
much in one go.

Chisato felt exhausted by the flames and dust and all she could remember 
was Miyu&#39;s flames sealing up five shinma at once. Seeing the dragon 
burst into flames meaning that the French shinma outburst had finished. 
Chisato stared at Miyu&#39;s angry face as the dragon burnt to ashes. Her 
eyes where nearly fading away. She tried to keep her body working she 
knew she wasn&#39;t going to die she was just tired. Then remembered Natsumi 
and Miyuki. They both got injured by the battle.

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu called out &quot;Are you OK?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine&quot; Chisato replied &quot;But what about Natsumi and Miyuki?&quot; Chisato 
ran over to the two brave cops, they both had their eyes closed with 
oozing blood Miyu stepped over to check up on them. Chisato felt her 
eyes steaming up. Miyu touched both of their foreheads. Shiina jumped 
onto the floor then gazed down. Miyu turned around then walked up to 
Chisato. Natsumi and Miyuki were dead. &quot;Sorry Chisato&quot; Miyu told her.

&quot;This is all my fault&quot; Chisato replied &quot;I just wanted to come back 
because I missed you and everything&quot; Chisato was beginning to sob &quot;Now I 
just made your job harder and two other people are dead because of me.&quot; 
Miyu had almost felt bad herself for taking advantage of both Chisato 
and Larva.

&quot;Don&#39;t blame yourself,&quot; Miyu whispered stroking Chisato&#39;s sweet golden 
red hair. &quot;It was them shinma&#39;s fault&quot;

&quot;Am I a chore to you?&quot; Chisato asked

&quot;No&quot; Miyu replied, &quot;You&#39;re the greatest thing that&#39;s ever happened to me 
and about those cops they&#39;ll have their own little world of happiness&quot;

&quot;They were perfectly happy until I came along&quot; Chisato admitted to 
herself &quot;Every one I get close to dies on me&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think so negative&quot; Miyu replied. She couldn&#39;t think of any more 
words or actions to do or say in this situation than to bring her lips 
onto Chisato&#39;s mouth. She knew that Chisato always loved it when Miyu 
kissed her. Another sweet kiss that had brightened Chisato up again. As 
the kiss broke both girls began to smile. &quot;You look really tired 
Chisato&quot;

&quot;I know&quot; Chisato replied &quot;Couldn&#39;t really sleep over in Japan I&#39;ve kept 
thinking of you all the time&quot; Miyu was astonished Miyu had felt the same 
way about her. She couldn&#39;t really sleep either. Actually Miyu doesn&#39;t 
even sleep often as she&#39;s usually out searching for blood to feed on.

&quot;I felt the same way is well&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;We better leave&quot; Larva announced, &quot;The police force are coming, if they 
find us it will get suspicious.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go Chisato&quot; Miyu told her reaching her hand out for Chisato to 
touch. Chisato grabbed it then she yawned then fell asleep on Miyu&#39;s 
shoulder leaving a sweet grunt in between. Shiina became worried then 
asked Miyu if Chisato&#39;s OK. &quot;She&#39;ll be fine&quot; Miyu replied patting Shiina 
on the head &quot;She&#39;s just sleeping&quot; Miyu then tried to pick her up then 
with Larva and Shiina on her shoulder both disappeared.



Chisato opened her yes again, satisfied that she had received enough 
hours of extra sleep felt the soft flesh of Miyu on her and her arms 
around her showing a glowing ball. Into the ball she saw two familiar 
people in it. Natsumi and Miyuki lying on a white bed both smiling. 
Chisato wasn&#39;t really paying attention to what they were saying. She 
paid more attention to Miyu&#39;s embrace. 

&quot;Have we been here before?&quot; Chisato asked, &quot;This place looks kinda 
familiar&quot; The red skies and endless lines of trees with white round 
balls hanging on it.

&quot;It&#39;s my world&quot; Miyu replied

&quot;It&#39;s a very nice Miyu&quot; Chisato replied

&quot;It was were I put you when you were in an eternal dream&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s where I remember it from&quot; Chisato replied. She looked further 
into the ball seeing Natsumi and Miyuki kiss gently

Miyuki: If you had children Natsumi, what would you call them?

Natsumi: I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve never thought about having children, I just 
wanted to have fun in my life. 

Miyuki: I&#39;ve always loved you, you know that?

Natsumi: You always go on about it. At first I thought you loved Ken, 
because there was so much chemistry between you

Miyuki: I nearly gave everything up and risked it for you through and 
usually it doesn&#39;t work but it was all worth it. 

&quot;Chisato&quot; Miyu stated, &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;

&quot;Sorry for what?&quot; Chisato reacted

&quot;I used you&quot; Miyu stated &quot;I used you for my own pleasure, achieve my own 
goals and as an excuse&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s OK&quot; Chisato replied, &quot;I know you would never cheat on me&quot; Chisato 
happily leaned over to kiss Miyu. &quot;So what about Reiha did she dies?&quot;

&quot;She was knocked out, probably dead&quot; Miyu replied, &quot;Matsukaze was 
shattered so he&#39;s dead&quot;

&quot;Thank god for that&quot; Chisato breathed, &quot;He was so annoying&quot;

&quot;Thank you for coming up to me&quot; Miyu told her

Shiina jumped up to them excitably &quot;You two off in your own world again&quot; 
she moaned &quot;You Miyu always thanks Chisato and is always polite with 
Larva giving them both the credit and what about me eh? &quot;

&quot;You complain too much Shiina&quot; Miyu replied wrapping her arm around 
Chisato&#39;s neck kissing her on the cheek.

&quot;It&#39;s all smoochie, smoochie, smoochie, smoochie, smoochie with you 
Miyu?&quot; Shiina stated, &quot;Just like you were with...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just as you are &quot; Miyu corrected Shiina

&quot;Just like you are all the time with Chisato&quot; Shiina corrected herself 
&quot;Gonna do anything hot and sexy&quot; Shiina asked &quot;Like chocolate and 
scream, ice and blood, dildos and vibrators&quot;

&quot;That is none of your business Shiina&quot; Miyu confirmed

&quot;You haven&#39;t changed a single bit,&quot; Shiina stated looking at Chisato and 
Miyu they were friends, lovers and everything in between.
