<h1>Bondage, Yuri and Ninja Schoolgirls (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../doa/index.html">Dead or Alive</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hexelf.html">Hex Elf</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../doa/byns-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>DOATEC was so sloppy. Ayane had eliminated their security systems with 
such ease even though she had to improvise through it all. She was also 
the only Mugen Tenshin member that they had been unable to catch. They 
had caught Hayate to act as a puppet for the epsilon project, Kasumi had
been caught during the Alpha project and even the all mighty Hayabusa 
had been caught for a brief while when they started the Omega project. 
Ayane had seen the results of some of them even though she had never 
been subjected to any of the projects herself. The Epsilon project had 
been a failure through and through but learning from their mistakes 
DOATEC managed to create the Alpha clones while Kasumi was in their 
captivity, Kasumi had put a stop to their plans however when the first 
clone emerged to take her place however. Furthering their efforts DOATEC
created a super clone with the help of Haybusa&#39;s genes, no one except 
Genra had ever seen it however. He had been utterly defeated by it and 
DOATEC turned him into a driveling monster to cover for their exploits 
and turn the clan&#39;s attention elsewhere. After Ayane had taken his life 
with her own hands she had sworn to take revenge on DOATEC personally 
and destroy the samples of as many of the projects as she could. 

Their futile attempts to capture her had only proven that she was only 
one worthy of ruling the Mugen Tenshin clan and be of the highest rank 
in the Tenjin Mon branch rather than her current status as the leader of
the serving class; the Hajin Mon. Ayane was the only one worthy and 
powerful enough to ascend to the position now that Kasumi had refused to
take it. She would take the two, Hayate and Kasumi, in and make them her
personal pets unless they wanted to be chased for the rest of their 
lives for leaving the clan. Ayane admitted to herself that she was 
attracted to both her half siblings in ways that would be considered 
unnatural to some, however it was mere physical attraction and none of 
them were really worthy of serving as anything more than a mere 
plaything. 

Ayane looked around, she had been fueling her ego ever since she was 
first appointed as second in command of the Hajin Mon branch while her 
detested half sister was appointed the successor of the Tenjin Mon class
leader branch. Ayane was always the more powerful but even when she had 
mastered the art of chi channeling to a degree much further than anyone 
before her had ever done she was still overshadowed by her sister. She 
wanted to make Kasumi pay so badly, she would dominate and humiliate 
her, she would make Kasumi submit to her every whim and never let her be
touched by anyone other than Ayane. Only when she had made Kasumi pay 
for all the times she had pushed Ayane down and made her submit to even 
the most vile suggestions that Ayane could think of would she let Kasumi
die. 

Lost in her thoughts worked her way past DOATEC&#39;s heavy defense system 
as if they where nothing and she soon reached the floor where her target
had been sighted. It was inside the DOATEC&#39;s own headquarters. She 
looked through the window inside the building and could see the green 
light emitting from the cellar below. There was no known way in but the 
tanks could been seen from her view and with little effort Ayane smashed
through the window and jumped inside. 

The tournament had been tough and even though that moron Zack had 
defeated her, with sheer luck, in the final he had merely run off as 
Genra appeared before them leaving her to deal with it. Which in the end
was exactly what she wanted so she could forgive the kick boxer for 
humiliating her. She had conserved enough strength for the final battle 
and taken Genra&#39;s life with his own weapon. The Moon of the Hajin Mon 
was glowing in her hands and now that it was in her possession she could
easily claim any position within the Hajin Mon and even destroy anyone 
who opposed her taking Kasumi&#39;s place now that she was missing. 

Ayane smiled to herself, Kasumi wouldn&#39;t be able to hide for long with 
both branches after her and soon all that Ayane had ever wished for 
would finally be hers. 

Down in the deep shaft she found the laboratory she had been looking 
for. The tanks that entombed the lifeless Alpha clones where still 
active but there was nobody around. It was well past midnight and the 
staff had left for the day ready to continue their research the day 
after. Not that there would be anything left tomorrow Ayane thought. On 
an operating table in the middle of the room she could see a clone that 
the staff had been working on during the day. She was an exact duplicate
of Ayane&#39;s half sister but as she looked at it there were no family 
bonds between them even though it shared the exact same genetic pattern 
as Kasumi. 

Ayane walked up to the table and examined the body. The clone was only 
covered in a white sheet that was soon removed as the Hajin Mon kunoichi
went in for a closer look. Under the sheet was a completely naked body 
except for a white choker similar to the one that the real Kasumi 
usually wore. Ayane was impressed at the amount of detail and she 
remembered exactly why she wanted to have her own half sibling as a 
lover doll, her body, like Hayate&#39;s, was absolutely amazing. She was 
strapped to the table by her hands and feet and some cords were 
connected to the clone&#39;s head. The cord in turn were connected to a 
laptop close to the table. Ayane looked at the laptop and with that mere
glance she figured was feeding the clone information; she probably was 
up over the night to be fed data so that she could operate the day 
after. Ayane unplugged her from the computer as she saw the clone move. 

&quot;No need for her to know anymore now that she&#39;s going to die anyway.&quot; 
She thought. 

&quot;A... &quot; The clone moaned. 

Ayane looked in shock as the clone started moving and opened her eyes. 
Even her eyes were exactly like her sister&#39;s but there had a confused 
look on them rather than that innocent one that Kasumi always carried 
around. 

&quot;A... A...&quot; The clone stammered. She looked at Ayane and tried to move 
but was held down by the straps. The straps unlocked however as a part 
of the awakening process and she reached for the sheets to cover herself
with. Ayane would have none of that however and threw them away. 

&quot;Ayane...&quot; The clone said finally able to put letters into words. The 
look of confusion turned into one of mixed fear and excitement as Ayane 
checked her out. 

Ayane checked the computer and read up on the files quickly. The clone 
had been fed some information about her but not the relation to her or 
their brother Hayate. She quickly had many ideas of what she could feed 
the clone and what uses she could have of her. It was nothing she had 
time for however, she needed to plant some explosives. C4 was way too 
powerful for a small room such as this so the usual plastic ones would 
be fine. 

&quot;Ayane... please...&quot; The Kasumi clone looked frightened as Ayane was 
placing the bombs around in the room. 

&quot;What is it!?&quot; Ayane asked in an angry tone, she had no time to be 
dealing with a mere clone who was about to be blown up with the 
building. &quot;You&#39;re in for a long sleep, so just lie down and be quiet 
ok?&quot; 

As always her sister defied her and the clone sat up looking at her with
those puppy eyes that only Kasumi could summon. 

&quot;Ayane... please... don&#39;t leave me...&quot; The clone was now rapidly putting
words into sentences and her learning ability, which was most 
impressive, was the result of expert programming developed by DOATEC&#39;s 
staff. It didn&#39;t sound like Kasumi however, she would never let Ayane 
see such a weak side of her. 

Ayane paused and walked back to the clone who was now sitting at the 
edge of the table doing her best to cover her body. She shivered as 
Ayane approached her grabbing her by the chin. 

&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Ayane could clearly see more uses of the clone, she could 
perhaps keep this one for herself. The clan would be against it 
though... &quot;Fuck em!&quot; Ayane decided that now that she was in possession 
of the Moon blade she would be the ones who were telling them what they 
can and can&#39;t do, not the other way around. 

&quot;Very well then.&quot; Ayane smiled wickedly. &quot;Give me a good reason to take 
me with you and I won&#39;t leave you here to die with the rest.&quot; 

The clone didn&#39;t understand what this meant but she felt Ayane moving 
her arms aside to reveal her breasts. Just like the original she a set 
of large, attractive and soft breasts to show for and Ayane was 
impressed with the likeness. She could have sworn this was her half 
sister had she not known it was mere clone. Even the weak whimpers she 
made as Ayane started touching her were the same. 

&quot;You are Kasumi then?&quot; Ayane asked testing the clone. 

&quot;Yes.&quot; The clone said in confidence, she truly believed she was Kasumi 
of the Mugen Tenshin clan. 

&quot;And who am I?&quot; Ayane asked. 

&quot;You are Ayane... my... my...&quot; Kasumi seemed to be unsure about this. 
She knew Ayane but she couldn&#39;t remember their connection. 

&quot;Lover.&quot; Ayane filled in with a wicked smile. 

&quot;Oh... &quot; Kasumi looked unsure. &quot;But you&#39;re... you&#39;re a...&quot; 

&quot;A woman?&quot; The Hajin Mon kunoichi filled in again. &quot;Yes, but so are 
you.&quot; 

This somehow made sense in Kasumi&#39;s confused mind. Ayane was a woman and
so was she, it made sense for them to be lovers then, if they were the 
same. She also had strong feelings for Ayane but she recognized those 
feelings of sisterly love as something entirely different. 

&quot;You don&#39;t remember?&quot; Ayane asked. &quot;Kiss me then and see that I am 
right.&quot; She didn&#39;t wait for Kasumi to comply and instead forced her lips
onto the clone&#39;s. Kasumi gasped but quickly recognized those lips as 
those of someone she cared about. Ayane pushed her back and soon they 
were lying on the table, a fully dressed Ayane in black ninja leather on
top of a nude Kasumi. Ayane enjoyed this and she couldn&#39;t even remember 
when she had first started fantasizing about forcing her half sister 
into kissing her. 

&quot;OH!&quot; Kasumi moaned as she was finally released. &quot;Oh Ayane... I... I... 
love you!&quot; 

&quot;I know.&quot; Ayane moved down the body of the clone kissing her naked skin 
all the way down before she reached the crevice between Kasumi&#39;s legs. 

The security system was now activated and was put on to code red. Ayane 
had previously sneaked past all the devices but her delay in the clone 
room had alerted the systems. Being busy playing with her new toy she 
had forgotten about the timer mechanism she had first passed and since 
she was already in the clone room the security computer decided to take 
the most drastic action and release the clones before they were 
destroyed. 

&quot;Oh... OH!&quot; the Kasumi clone groaned as she could feel Ayane kissing her
uncovered sex and treating it as if it was a small mouth she was making 
out with. She was confused but the tingling sensation was something she 
enjoyed. Kasumi struggled slightly but was forcefully held in place by 
Ayane who had every intention of not letting the clone have any of her 
will come through. She hummed as she tasted the delicate juices that 
emitted from Kasumi&#39;s sex as she was getting more excited. Kasumi gasped
and leaned back unable to fight off the stern ministrations of her new 
lover and Ayane was pleased with this. 

After a brief upload on the situation the first clone was activated. She
opened her eyes inside the tank and looked around. Her new mission was 
to destroy the intruded using her pre-programmed arts of ninjitsu. 
Waiting for the feedback to finish and for the airlock on the tanker she
was in to be released she watched the scene unfold before her. She 
recognized Ayane and the scene displayed before her was highly erotic, 
she had never thought she would see Ayane in this situation. 

Kasumi relaxed her legs more and moved with Ayane&#39;s rhythm as she was 
now given light and quick licks over her most sensual area. Ayane was 
really getting into this and because it acted as some kind of release 
from years of frustration it had overwhelmed her in a very short time 
She wanted to play with her new toy and she wasn&#39;t going to let the 
clone call it quits until she said so. Kasumi found her nipples erect 
and started playing with them slightly to increase the stimulation she 
was getting, it was very pleasant indeed and in a way she really enjoyed
being taken this forcefully and being dominated by the one she loved so.

The final systems were activated and the computer opted to release the 
airlocks instantly as the feedback finished for each of the clones. It 
would release hundreds of gallons of fluid into the room but it had 
calculated the risks and decided it was actually a good thing since the 
highly acidic water, while designed to preserve skin tissue it would 
prove very effective to destroy the plastic bombs. The first clone who 
was appointed the leader was released from the airlock. 

Ayane got to her feet and Kasumi was left confused and very wet when the
first wave of water hit them. She could see the first clone being 
released and was glad to see her. She was another one, a sister of some 
sort, maybe she wanted to join in? 

&quot;Target sighted, destroy with extreme prejudice.&quot; The acidic water 
settled over the floor only half an inch above the surface. Soon the 
second clone was released however the water level became significantly 
higher. 

Ayane watched as one clone after another was released and with water 
violently crashing into the room as each lock was released. Soon all 
five had been released and Ayane was now knee deep in the acidic water. 
It didn&#39;t hurt her skin but it was quickly burning through her boots and
pants as if it was some kind of chemical reaction. Panicking Ayane tried
jumping out the water to climb up again but was stopped by three of the 
clones jumping at her simultaneously. After her leg was grabbed, a kick 
to the chest and falling backwards into the water one of them landed on 
her both feet on the shoulders. Ayane held her breath as she struggled 
to get out but was caught from all around and held under the water by 
all four limbs. The acid burned through her clothes and in less than a 
minute they were all but gone and the acid was working it&#39;s way through 
her underwear. 

&quot;God... I can&#39;t... die... like... THIS!&quot; Ayane started channeling as 
much of her chi as she possibly could but she was pulled up before she 
could actually do anything with it. The first clone pulled her up by the
throat and was ready to deliver the Tenjin Mon death strike. It never 
came however, the clone looked uncertain. 

&quot;Destroy the intruder!&quot; The computer growled into their circuits but 
they wouldn&#39;t follow orders. Their genes were forbidding them to take 
the life of their sister and the AI wasn&#39;t powerful enough to persuade 
them otherwise. 

Ayane looked at the clones, they were standing in a ring around her and 
the one holding her was trembling. Her hand was in just the right 
position and Ayane was impressed at how the DOATEC staff had been able 
to program even the Mugen Tenshin style and Tenjin Mon branch style into
them. 

The security computer was now considering other options, it had already 
activated every security mechanism in the building and had already 
called for the personnel on the bottom floor to apprehend the intruder. 
However the clones were supposed to have killed her by then and they 
weren&#39;t obeying the &#39;kill&#39; command. Instead it opted for another command
namely &#39;detain&#39;. 

The leader clone was inspired by the scene that had been displayed for 
her in the conservation chamber and she as well as the three others 
grabbed Ayane once again and forced her onto the table. The four worked 
in unison while the one Ayane had found merely watched as they pinned 
her to the tables and used the straps to tie her to it. After being 
robbed of her free movement Ayane started building her chi again as it 
was the only thing that could get her out of a situation like this. If 
she could stay alive for 10 minutes or so she would have gathered enough
chi to cause an explosion. During the time she struggled but being tied 
down to the table in a spread eagle position made most of her movement 
futile. The leader clone finished the bonding with the strap over 
Ayane&#39;s neck pinning her head down as well. 

&quot;You&#39;ll pay for this!&quot; Ayane growled realizing she had finally been 
caught by the staff of DOATEC and was utterly humiliated by this fact 
after taking so much pride in eluding them for so long. 

The clones started feeling her up in unison and Ayane suspected it might
be a trick to distract her from summoning chi. It was working however 
and working well too. After a while the four had started focusing on 
various parts of her body. One was focusing on her face while two other 
were giving all their attention to her breasts and nipples while the 
leader clone was teasing her sex. First they were using their hands and 
fingers but it soon became much more intimate than that and Ayane could 
feel lips caressing her. It was torture of the most exquisite nature. 
She was caught by the company that was holding her against her will and 
tied down to a position where she was completely helpless while she was 
molested by four clones of her hated sister while a fifth was watching 
and enjoying the show. And she was loving every second of it! 

Ayane couldn&#39;t help becoming really damp by the domination and 
humiliation she was going through, in her mind she hated it but at a 
physical level she had never been more aroused. Her nipples were being 
expertly licked and sucked upon while she was kissing the sweet lips of 
another Kasumi. Her sex was being teased oven more and she whimpered for
release and a hot mouth embracing it or something to put inside it. 

The computer was pleased with actions of the clones and how they had 
quickly turned threat from intruding spy to a shivering bound woman 
nearly crying out from lust and being completely helpless at the hands 
of the clones. Kasumi Epsilon however did not respond to its commands, 
instead she was merely watching and enjoying herself. She would pose a 
problem and would need to be either reprogrammed or executed, she was of
no concern to the AI now however as she was safely sealed inside the 
room. 

Ayane nearly cried out as her wish was finally coming true. She felt the
new Alpha clone expertly kissing and licking her sex. She was executing 
a perfect combination of tongue, lips and suction. Shivering from the 
attention she was given and feeling her nipples being treated expertly 
she came to wonder if it was Kasumi who was such an expert at treating 
women or if it was something the clones came with. The one kissing her 
mouth now moved away to watch Ayane&#39;s face as it was deformed in lust. 
Ayane blushed at this new experience and tried turning away, the clone 
held her there however and had a good view of Ayane&#39;s facial expressions
as the please became more and more intense. 

Soon it was becoming too much to handle however and Ayane desperately 
tried to break free as she could feel a powerful orgasm coming. She 
could still not fight her way out of it however and she was now letting 
out small cries from the attention she was giving. In small bursts of 
ecstasy she moaned and tensed as each lick passed over her sensitive 
areas. Her breasts were highly erogenous zones by now and there mere 
touch of a nipple was enough to send thrills throughout her entire body.

Epsilon was now watching Ayane too while she was fondling the clone 
holding her head. Ayane had not noticed at first but now she could see 
the clone watching her breathing heavily from her sister&#39;s 
ministrations. It only served to excite her even more though and now she
could feel a wet finger brushing over her anus also tickling the ring 
muscle teasing it for a way in. Ayane could not hold it in however and 
bit her lips as she felt a wave of pleasure broke through her mind and 
washed over her body like the wave from a storm at an ocean beach. 

&quot;Uhhhh.... AHHHHH!&quot; She cried out as she was hit again by an even more 
powerful sensation that overwhelmed the first. The clone holding her 
head was given the display of Ayane&#39;s face as she was having the orgasm 
of her life and it was most beautiful thing she had ever seen. Ayane 
rode the orgasm to the very end and her cheeks were blushing redder than
ever before when she settled down. She had been used, abused and seduced
by the two things she hated the most, Kasumi and the DOATEC, and she had
succumbed to them. Her final breaths of relief turned into a hiss of 
anger as she summoned all the chi should could muster creating a blue 
flame around her body burning the straps and the clones still touching 
her. 

The clones moved away from the agony and watched Ayane stand up. She 
took her favorite clone in her arms, the computer laptop and disappeared
in a cloud of Sakura leaves. The clones did have little time to think of
what happened when they could hear Buddhist rambling a giant ball of 
blue and white flames descending on them. 

&quot;So, what&#39;s the status?&quot; Helena asked. 

&quot;Only one clone remained intact.&quot; Christie confirmed and brought up the 
leader clone who had somehow survived. She was the direct upgrade of the
original Alpha clone and it seemed their AI had picked the more powerful
clone for the job as the leader status. 

&quot;Any DNA samples?&quot; Helena looked around but any DNA samples would have 
been burnt. 

&quot;Helena.&quot; The clone smiled and opened her mouth pointing at her tongue. 

&quot;I think there has been more going on here than it initially seemed.&quot; 
Christie said. &quot;Give me some time to watch the surveillance tapes and I 
will get back to you.&quot; 

&quot;Fine then.&quot; Helena not really having the set of mind it took to get 
what the clone meant. 

&quot;Maybe we could watch it together afterwards?&quot; Christie suggested 
already knowing what was on the tape after watching the clone&#39;s blushing
reaction. 

&quot;Yeah I guess.&quot; Helena shrugged her shoulders. &quot;Call me when you are 
done, I have a meeting to attend to.&quot; 

&quot;You do that.&quot; Christie said. &quot;Just make sure you wear that genie outfit
when you come by.&quot; 

&quot;Why should I do that?&quot; Helena wondered. &quot;For a mere security check up?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll find out.&quot; Christie wore a wicked smile. &quot;Trust me.&quot;
