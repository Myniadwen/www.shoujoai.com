<h1>Heartbreaker (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../doa/index.html">Dead or Alive</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../doa/heartbreak-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Ayane winced a little, trying hard to keep her throbbing foot from 
touching the ground. Even though the pain of her ankle was sharp, it 
was not the most pressing of issues on her mind. What bothered Ayane 
was the way that Kasumi was acting towards her. Why was Kasumi doing 
all this? Following her to her apartment, helping her to get over her 
injured ankle... what was it all for, what did it all mean?

The two female ninja&#146;s hobbled up the large flight of steps that led 
up to Ayane&#146;s newly rented apartment. Ayane&#146;s arm was cast around 
Kasumi X&#146;s shoulder for body support. All of the younger girl&#146;s weight 
was shifted to her right to avoid placing any more pressure on her 
injured ankle. Step after step was taken up the bland staircase; 
occasionally passing the odd apartment that belonged to other 
residents. Eventually they came to a light blue door that led into 
Ayane&#146;s apartment. 

Kasumi X looked back at Ayane. &#147;Do you have a key?&#148;

&#147;...&#148; Ayane said nothing. 

&#147;I said-&#147;

Suddenly Ayane chipped back in. &#147;I heard you. I have a key.&#148;

The lavender-haired beauty slipped her free hand into the side of her 
outfit, delving into a secret area she used to carry things such as 
these. Quickly she fished out a pair of keys and unlocked the front 
door. In a continued slow pace, Kasumi X ambled Ayane inside. The 
apartment was nothing flashy in anyway, cream carpeted floors, a 
substandard television, a large sofa and three open doorways to the 
kitchen, bathroom and bedroom splitting off from the main/living room. 
Kasumi X begun to wonder why Ayane would be living in a place like 
this, then realized that this must have been a temporary thing. 

{I suppose she is the type that travels a lot.} The clone thought. {I 
wonder what else there is about her that I&#146;m not aware of. It&#146;s-}

Kasumi X&#146;s thoughts were cut short as Ayane disentangled herself from 
her supporting embrace and limped over to the sofa positioned in the 
middle of the room. Ayane slumped into the seating with a thump, 
exhaling deeply and shutting her haunting red eyes closed. A silence 
fell, and for a while, Kasumi X remained respectfully quiet, half 
expecting Ayane to say something to her as a thank you. 

No &#145;thank you&#146; came. 

Before long, Kasumi X spoke out to try and motivate some interaction 
between the two of them. &#147;Are... are you feeling better?&#148;

When Ayane remained silent in response, the Kasumi clone continued on. 
&#147;I was worried that you might find it hard to get around.&#148;

Ayane slowly turned her head around, opening her eyes to reveal the 
harshest set of eyes Kasumi X had ever seen. The coldness of her eyes 
was matched by the iciness of her tongue. &#147;Get out.&#148;

The brunette was shocked. She had begun to think that Ayane was 
warming up to her. Now she seemed just as angry as she had been ten 
minutes ago. But why was Ayane so angry with her? It had to be down to 
the original Kasumi. What she could not understand was why Ayane hated 
Kasumi so much. There had to be a reason for it. For a few brief 
seconds, Kasumi X thought that she could find the answer within 
herself, but as soon as it came, this thought disappeared.  

Kasumi X slowly began to walk over to the couch Ayane was sitting on, 
her eyes focused on the younger girl with concern and just a hint of 
anxiety. &#147;How are you going to look after yourself if you can barely 
walk?&#148;

Ayane remained firm. &#147;I said get out.&#148;

Regardless, Kasumi X continued on. &#147;You can&#146;t really do it all on your 
own. No matter what your strength is.&#148;

Now Ayane was getting mad again. &#147;Didn&#146;t you hear me? I said get outta 
here! I swear if you don&#146;t get out, I&#146;ll throw you out!&#148;

Kasumi X&#146;s eyes thinned out. &#147;I&#146;m not leaving. And you can&#146;t force me 
to either.&#148;

Ayane was incredulous. This was absolutely unbelievable. Kasumi, her 
fiercest rival, her old nemesis, had just walked into her apartment 
and told her that she was not leaving. Ayane could not believe the 
obstinacy of this girl. Who in the hell did she think she was to just 
come in here and make declarations like that? 

Kasumi X&#146;s golden brown eyes softened a little when she saw Ayane 
struggling to get to her feet. Through her foolishness, Ayane was 
actually thinking about fighting her. But the injury of her ankle 
would not allow that, and the young kunoichi let out a hoarse cry of 
agony, stumbling forward. Like lightning, Kasumi X was by her side, 
holding onto Ayane tightly which stopped her from falling. By that 
point, Ayane was in too much pain to really concern herself with the 
way Kasumi (X) was holding her. The clone ignored the joy she felt 
from being so close to Ayane, and pulled one of the younger woman&#146;s 
slender arms around her shoulder. Kasumi X hauled herself into a 
standing position, bringing Ayane up with her, and her head darted 
from side to side to see which door led to the bedroom. It was the 
furthest to the left. She walked over in that direction, with a silent 
Ayane following in motion to this path. They passed through the 
bedroom door into the bedroom itself and without as second thought, 
Kasumi X moved over to the large-sized double bed. To ease in, the 
clone weakened her grip on Ayane&#146;s waist, and nodded her head under 
the other girl&#146;s arm, letting her body rest easily on the bed in a 
sitting position. Though Ayane&#146;s eyes were still locked shut from the 
sharp pains she received from stepping on her ankle in the way she 
previously did, she could tell that Kasumi (X) had helped her into the 
bedroom. Just for the time being, Ayane would not put too much heat on 
Kasumi (X) for this. She did not understand why her rival was acting 
like this, but her ankle meant that she really didn&#146;t have much of a 
choice about fighting with Kasumi. Ayane knew better than to take 
someone on while handicapped in any way. 

Ayane slid back, lying down evenly on the simplistic bed, letting out 
a quiet breath of irritation. Kasumi X then took a look at Ayane&#146;s leg 
from a distance (not really willing to get closer to Ayane lest she 
flip out again). Initially, the damage just looked to be internal 
bruising or a sprain. But Kasumi X began to realize that it was more 
serious than that. It had to be broken now, because of the stunt that 
Ayane pulled. More memories came to Kasumi X&#146;s mind, from her &#145;past&#146; 
or moreover the past of the real Kasumi. She knew that there were a 
few healing mixtures created by the Mugen Tenshin that supported and 
repaired damaged bones or torn muscles quite quickly. Medicine of that 
kind really wasn&#146;t common, they were trademark secrets of the Mugen 
Tenshin, but now these secrets were open to her. 

&#147;I&#146;ll be back in a minute.&#148; She said. 

After catching one last look at Ayane, Kasumi X wordlessly made her 
way out the door into the living room, then over into the kitchen. The 
kitchen was like the rest of the apartment, insipid and uninspired, 
but Kasumi X just hoped that she had all that she needed to make this 
remedy for Ayane&#146;s ankle. In a swift storm of motion, Kasumi X&#146;s arms 
and hand probed around the cupboards and sideboards of that place, 
searching for all the things she needed. For some reason, the kitchen 
did have an abundance of spices and herbs, and everything Kasumi X 
needed was there. In her haste, she speedily pulled out a grinding 
stone and bowl from a compartment she found in her previous search. 
Kasumi X placed it before her on the counter, taking down some of the 
herbs she needed. The brunette unfastened the lid on the first jar, 
and gingerly poured the crushed leaves of it into the grinding bowl. 
She did the same with the next two, adding it to the mix as best she 
could. 

{That should be enough.} Kasumi X thought.

She put the now useless jars of herbs back into their respective 
cupboards, and swiftly picked up the grinding stone. It was long, 
about 3.5 inches in length, while it was about two-thirds of an inch 
thick. It was more of shaft than anything else, perfect for smashing 
and mixing up certain ingredients in a small bowl. Kasumi X began the 
process, pounding at the herbs sharply, then dragging the stone around 
the bowl in a circular motion. She repeated the act over and over 
again; the aim was grind it down into a powder, which would then be 
mixed with a tiny bit of water to form a slushy substance.    

While the clone expertly did her job, her thoughts began to drift 
elsewhere. She really remembered very little about Kasumi&#146;s past, but 
she could recall this little instinct of herbal medicine preparation. 
And she knew that Ayane&#146;s suffering brought it on. Seeing Ayane in 
pain brought out a need to ease it. Spending time with Ayane might 
give her the chance to find out more about the past of the original 
model. But there was more to it than that. 

The clone of Kasumi had no real way to explain it, but she was really 
attracted to Ayane. It was hard to believe, Ayane was so confronting 
and angry by nature, which might have put off others. But Kasumi X was 
not about to be intimidated by that. She just had to be... close to 
the fair-haired kunoichi. Just to be around her was enough. Kasumi X 
stopped pushing around the stone when she saw that her mixture had 
been finally ground into a powder, and then put it to one side, taking 
the bowl over to the sink. 

The marble-eyed ninja brought the bowl under the tap, carefully 
turning the valve to release drops of water. This had to be done with 
care, simply because too much water negated the effects of the secret 
concoction. After putting in very small amounts of water, Kasumi X 
pulled out a small butter knife from a sideboard and began to mix the 
remedy in the bowl again. Now that it was moist, the powered herbs 
moved a little less easily, but all the same it was no problem to do 
this. After five minutes of stirring, Kasumi X brought it to her 
smell-sensitive nose, in inspection of it. The remedy was complete. 

The young ninja (with the remedy bowl in hand) checked for some 
bandages and found them with no trouble. She walked out of the kitchen 
with both, and slipped back into Ayane&#146;s bedroom. She had only been 
gone for a few minutes but Ayane was already asleep. Kasumi X simply 
stood in place, watching the kunoichi sleep. Even though her anger and 
over-confidence indicated otherwise, Ayane had almost angelic beauty. 
Her chest rose and fell with each breath drawn into her, her body 
poised gently to one side. Kasumi X did her best to ignore the aching 
throb between her legs and concentrated on the task at hand. It was 
sort of intrusive to do this while Ayane was sleeping, but the injury 
had to be taken care of now before it got any worse. Besides, it might 
actually be easier to handle this way. 

The clone set the bandages and remedy bowl down on the bed, turning 
her gaze over to Ayane&#146;s leg. Kasumi X was nervous to do this, but 
carried on for Ayane&#146;s own good. She kneeled down beside the bed and 
took Ayane&#146;s leg (with the injured ankle) in a soft grasp. Slowly (to 
prevent from waking Ayane) Kasumi X nudged off the violet-coloured 
shoe that her &#145;charge&#146; was wearing. Once that was out of the way, her 
attentions were on the pure purple fabric that was clinging tightly to 
Ayane&#146;s smooth leg. With great care, Kasumi X peeled it back, pushing 
the material above her ankle. Now the clone had a perfect view of the 
ankle. It looked a little sore, but wasn&#146;t as bad as she expected it 
to be. Kasumi X stretched her arm over to the mixing bowl, and brought 
it closer. She dipped her middle and index fingers into the remedy, 
which had formed a sort of balm. Then, using more of that quiet 
gentleness, Kasumi X rubbed the salve over Ayane&#146;s pain-ridden ankle. 
She did this in a series of circular motions, spreading it over the 
injury tenderly. Once Kasumi X&#146;s fingers had run dry, she plunged them 
back into the remedy and withdrew a new sample of it. The young woman 
repeated this process on Ayane&#146;s ankle for quiet a few minutes, 
pausing only when she heard the Woman Tengu release a slight moan. 

Kasumi X&#146;s eyes darted back up to look at Ayane&#146;s face. She was still 
asleep, that was for sure. But curiously, there was an odd expression 
on her face. One that was halfway between nervousness and delight. 
Kasumi X continued her massage of the girl&#146;s ankle, keeping a watchful 
eye on her reaction. Ayane again let out a small moan of comfort, 
although this time she managed to utter a few words in her sleep.

Ayane wriggled a little &#147;Mmmm... H-Hayate...&#148; 

A wave of envy filled Kasumi X from hearing that name. 

Hayate.

What did that man mean to her? To the original? And more importantly, 
what did he mean to Ayane? Why was it that Kasumi X felt safe yet 
envious of that name?

The K-2 remembered Ayane saying that name before; her voice was as 
sweet and as innocent as she had ever heard it before. She remembered 
the weird feeling of confusion and regret that in brought. This 
feeling was similar, but different. Right now she was more concerned 
with the connection between Ayane and Hayate. 

What were they to each other? Friends, allies... or lovers? Kasumi X 
didn&#146;t really like the idea of someone being with Ayane that way. But 
it did make sense. The only time the clone had seen any real affection 
from Ayane was when she spoke the name of Hayate. Either way, Kasumi X 
tried her best not to put too much thought to this.

After finishing with the rubbing remedy, Kasumi X grabbed the set of 
bandages on the bed and began to slowly wrap them around Ayane&#146;s 
ankle. Though she wasn&#146;t experienced with these things, she knew 
fairly well how to deal with them. In a few long minutes, Ayane&#146;s 
ankle had been safely bandaged and with the remedy rubbed onto her 
injury it would heal very soon. The brunette stood up from her brief 
crouching position, and then walked over to the door, strolling out of 
Ayane&#146;s bedroom. 

Had she stayed any longer, she would have heard more of Ayane&#146;s 
sleep-induced banter. 

&#147;...K-Kasumi...&#148;

**********

Ayane&#146;s eyes fluttered open when the alarm by her bedside went off. 
Her hand smacked the button on it and slut the thing off before it 
annoyed the hell out of her. Ayane set her alarm to go off at late in 
the day so she could train at midnight. It was definitely night 
therefore. Then the last thing she remembered was being put to bed by 
Kasumi. 

Kasumi. 

The brain of the Mugen Tenshin Hajin-mon ninja ran a mile a minute 
thinking about this situation. Why was Kasumi acting like this? They 
had never made any real attempts to be nice to each other, what was 
different now? Then this confusion increased when Ayane moved her 
ankle a little. It didn&#146;t hurt as much as it did last night. She 
wondered why this might be and then her nose for ninja scents picked 
up on something that just wasn&#146;t normal for this apartment. She racked 
her brain trying to figure out what that smell was, and then it dawned 
on her. 

It was the scent of a special medicine developed by the Mugen Tenshin 
to deal with sprains, fractures and muscle strain. Ayane&#146;s scarlet 
eyes looked down at her injured ankle and saw that it had also been 
bandaged. Kasumi had treated it will she was sleeping. 

Ayane just could not get her head around it. But was she still here, 
or...

Another smell wafted into the room. &#147;...What is that? Tsukimi soba?&#148;

It was for sure; someone was cooking in her apartment. And Ayane had a 
fair idea of who it was. Since she fell asleep in her normal clothing, 
Ayane didn&#146;t really bother to think about changing, and stepped off 
her bed in a relaxed manner, putting very little pressure on her 
ankle.  

She stepped up and walked out of her bedroom slowly, following the 
smell of Tsukimi soba into the kitchen. Ayane was correct in her 
suspicions; Kasumi (X) was hunched over a stove with a set of noodles 
cooking in the pot before. She slowly turned her head around when she 
heard footsteps, to see Ayane, with a face shrouded in disbelief. 

Ayane scowled. &#147;What the hell do you think you&#146;re doing?&#148;

&#147;I was just...&#148; Kasumi X struggled for a way to explain this. &#147;I hope 
you don&#146;t mind... I spent the night here... I guess...&#148;

One of Ayane&#146;s hands balled into a fist at the side of her body, 
shaking hard. If she was at full health, there was no way she would 
allow this to happen. But at this point in time, the lilac-haired 
ninja was disadvantaged. What&#146;s more, she was beginning to start 
believing that Kasumi was genuinely concerned about her. Why else 
would she be here, doing all this? Unless she was up to something. 

&#147;Why are you doing this?&#148; Ayane asked directly. 

Kasumi X shuffled a little. &#147;I just wanted... to make sure that you 
were... okay with your ankle like that.&#148;

&#147;Is that so?&#148; Ayane thought about that. &#147;Well my ankle is perfectly 
fine. Now leave.&#148;

Kasumi X shook her head. &#147;I can&#146;t do that.&#148;

&#147;Geh.&#148; Ayane growled under her breath, struggling to keep her anger in 
check. &#147;Well if you don&#146;t get out, then *I&#146;m* leaving.&#148;

In a flash, Kasumi X used her ninja agility and dashed around a 
swerving Ayane, to move in front of the door. The clone branched out 
her arms and blocked Ayane&#146;s path, her resolved complimented with a 
determined look in her bright brown eyes. 

&#147;You can&#146;t go!&#148; She yelled defiantly, almost desperately. 

Ayane&#146;s confusion stunned her into silence. What was going on with 
Kasumi? Why was she behaving like this? Such a change in her actions 
caught Ayane so far off guard it was insane. 

Kasumi X decided to cover her tracks before she could sound any more 
paranoid (or possessive). &#147;Please just... stay put until your ankle 
gets a little better? Please?&#148;

&#147;...Why should I do you any favours?&#148; Though she was still a tad 
hostile in her words, Ayane began to lose some of that anger from 
hearing Kasumi X&#146;s plea.  
   
&#147;This isn&#146;t for me,&#148; The brown-eyed kunoichi said. &#147;Its for your 
benefit. The remedy won&#146;t work if you walk around too much. Just give 
it a few hours to get better.&#148;
Ayane surrendered her resolve. She didn&#146;t like the way this was 
heading. Submitting to Kasumi&#146;s requests. But like she said, it was 
for Ayane&#146;s benefit, not Kasumi&#146;s. The Female Tengu&#146;s eyes rolled from 
her defeat. &#147;Fine.&#148;

Kasumi X picked up a tiny smile. At least she was getting through to 
the girl, even if it wasn&#146;t by much. The clone lowered her arms from 
the door and stepped to one side, to allow Ayane passage. 

Without looking at her rival, Ayane stepped though the door, back into 
the living room, then into her bedroom. There was no way she could 
train in her current condition. Rather than think about that, she 
eased into a sitting position on her bed, stretching out one of her 
arms to the floor under it. She flickered with the few items that were 
located there until she grasped a bottle, and tugged it upward. 

It was a bottle of vodka. 

Ayane wasn&#146;t a drinker by any standard, but it was a gift from a 
previous &#145;client&#146; who was very pleased with her assassination skills. 
It would be rude to just waste it, and with all the things going in 
her life right now, making herself feel a little better with this was 
a natural reaction. Typical human weakness. 

Ayane unfastened the cap around the top of the bottle, tossing it to 
one side. She pulled out a shot glass from the bedside cabinet, then 
poured a little of her drink into it, and then set the bottle one the 
ground. 

Just as the glass reached her lips, Kasumi X appeared in the doorway.

&#147;You shouldn&#146;t drink things like that,&#148; She said, with a disapproving 
glance. &#147;It&#146;s not really becoming of you.&#148;

Ayane grinned, gulping it down in one go. &#147;Great.&#148; She said, wiping 
her brow. &#147;I&#146;m getting lifestyle tips from you of all people. I must 
have reached an all new low.&#148;

Kasumi X ignored Ayane&#146;s sarcasm and walked over to the bed, sitting 
in an opposite position from the Mugen Tenshin Hajin-mon ninja. A 
silence fell upon the two of them, but Ayane&#146;s disregard for tact 
shortly broke it. 

&#147;Is there a reason you&#146;re in here?&#148; She enquired.

Kasumi X&#146;s thoughts drifted back to last night. &#147;Who... who is 
Hayate?&#148;

Instantly, the clone felt like she made a mistake when she saw that 
perplexed expression of Ayane&#146;s. &#147;You&#146;re kidding, right?&#148;

Kasumi X said nothing to respond, and Ayane took that as Kasumi (X)&#146;s 
way of playing more stupid mind games. &#147;You wanna play games then, 
yeah? Fine. I have one for you. If you answer my question, I&#146;ll answer 
yours. Deal?&#148;

The clone girl nodded. &#147;Okay.&#148;

Ayane could not believe she was playing along to this, but... &#147;Hayate 
is your brother. And was going to be ordained as the next leader of 
the Mugen Tenshin Tenjin-mon.&#148; Ayane&#146;s mocking tone died down as she 
continued. &#147;He... disappeared recently. And I... the clan, want him 
back.&#148;

Kasumi X pressed on. &#147;Is he... important to you...?&#148;

By sheer will, Ayane chose to ignore that. &#147;That&#146;s not important. And 
now it&#146;s your turn.&#148;

Kasumi X nodded to accept whatever question Ayane might have. &#147;Okay.&#148;

&#147;Why are you acting like this?&#148;

**********

In the beautiful setting of the Miyama, a tranquil safe house for the 
spirit of the shinobi, a battle had just taken place. A fierce battle 
between two warriors. Two ninja. Two siblings.  

Kasumi and Ein. 

When they first met each other here, it was a great surprise for them 
both. It was surprising for Kasumi because she finally found her 
brother, and for Ein, because this woman actually knew him. She would 
be a clue to discovering his past. It seemed natural for the two of 
them to do battle, even though her agenda was discovering her 
brother&#146;s condition, Kasumi had to admit, she was curious about how 
much Hayate had improved on himself. 

That battle was immense, but in the end, Kasumi had managed to 
overcome her brother. As his body came to rest on the ground, Kasumi 
(the original, pure Kasumi) rushed to his side and she cradled him in 
her arms. He was okay. Hayate was okay. 

Slowly, Ein&#146;s eyes opened up. &#147;...K-Kasumi...?&#148;

Kasumi smiled brightly. &#147;Hayate... you are...&#148;

The older man&#146;s hand came to touch his sister&#146;s cheek. It really was 
her. Kasumi was here. Suddenly all his memories came flashing back in 
a haze of warmth, and Ein re-evolved into his true form. 

Hayate, shinobi of the wind. 

The Mugen Tenshin successor smiled at his sister. &#147;Its you. Kasumi. 
Thank you... for this... all.&#148;

**********

Kasumi X watched Ayane on tenterhooks as she started to feel the 
effects of the drink. They had been talking for the past twenty 
minutes, and the bottle had been reduced to a quarter of its former 
self. Ayane&#146;s speech was becoming slurred and her disposition was much 
more relaxed. On the upside, she was at least being more honest.

Ayane brought the shot glass down with a compressed sigh, leaning back 
on the bed. &#147;This is rich, isn&#146;t it? I&#146;d sooner die than spend any 
with you, but here I damn well am. It&#146;s crazy, huh? But then not for 
you, eh? Not for you, you just...just force your way in and start 
telling me that you aren&#146;t goin&#146; nowhere. That flash attitude doesn&#146;t 
bother me though... heh, heh, heh, I know you...&#148;

Kasumi X sighed. &#147;...Ayane... maybe you&#146;ve had enough. It&#146;s getting 
late...&#148;

&#147;Ah, shaddap.&#148; The lilac-haired ninja replied. &#147;What makes you think 
you can tell me what to do? That&#146;s always been your way hasn&#146;t it? You 
think you&#146;re so damn sweet. So damn pure. Like you&#146;re damn well 
untouchable. What makes you better than me? Eh? What makes you better 
than me?!&#148;

The clone&#146;s brown eyes retreated from Ayane&#146;s piercing gaze, actually 
demanding an answer. Ayane was raising an issue that was probably 
important to her and the original Kasumi; unfortunately, Kasumi X 
still could not fully recall the past. Therefore, she really couldn&#146;t 
answer the question.  
 
&#147;...&#148; 

Kasumi X remained silent, further annoying Ayane. &#147;Geez, can&#146;t you 
make at least one good reason for yourself? What is it with you?&#148;

Just then, Kasumi X&#146;s tongue and reflex did the work for her thoughts. 
&#147;Can you give me a good reason for being so angry with me?&#148; 

Ayane looked away from Kasumi (X). That was something that she really 
didn&#146;t want to venture in. Because she had done it so many times in 
the past. And the kunoichi could not understand it. Back in the old 
days of the Mugen Tenshin, when Ayane, Kasumi and Hayate were a few 
years younger, things were so much easier back then. Even though they 
had to train constantly and prepare for their futures as ninja&#146;s, 
Ayane could admit that it was a happy point in her life. One of the 
few happy points in her life. After then, things went from bad to 
worse. Hayate&#146;s temporary crippling at the hands of Raidou was the 
event that shook things up. Kasumi was ordered to take on Hayate&#146;s 
position and succeed as leader of the Tenjin-mon. But rather than 
accept that honour, she chose to run away in the way she always did. 
Always running, always retreating. Never standing up to face her 
problems. And in the process of fleeing and becoming a runaway ninja, 
she left everything and everyone she had ever known behind.

Including Ayane. 

Deep inside her heart, Ayane felt an anger stir once more. But then 
that anger gave way to something she couldn&#146;t really relinquish, no 
matter how much she disciplined herself. Sadness. 

Ayane slowly turned her head back around to stare Kasumi (X) face to 
face. And the brunette was shocked by that look of dejection and 
insecurity mirrored in Ayane&#146;s vibrant scarlet orbs. 

&#147;Why did you leave...?&#148; She asked, her voice breaking into a whisper. 

Kasumi X was surprised. That same affection and tenderness that 
overtook Ayane when she spoke of Hayate was happening right now. To 
her. But what did it all mean?

The Japanese brunette looked down, her stare falling to the carpeted 
ground. It wasn&#146;t that she *didn&#146;t* want to answer the question; she 
just could not do it. Kasumi&#146;s memories were locked up tighter than 
steel. 

&#147;I wish I had an answer for you.&#148; She admitted sadly. &#147;But I just 
don&#146;t know.&#148;

A few seconds past and Kasumi X realized that Ayane had not responded 
to her. She then looked up at the other girl from the corner of her 
eye, to see a curious expression on Ayane&#146;s face. The look she was 
giving off was sort of unreadable, very hard to describe. An unusual 
combination of fear, doubt, resolution and most astoundingly, desire. 

Kasumi X was so caught up with this notion that she had not realized 
that the gap between herself and Ayane on the bed was decreasing. In a 
sudden flash, she was aware that Ayane was right in front of her, 
their faces mere inches apart; so close that Kasumi X could quite 
clearly smell traces of Ayane&#146;s fragrant scent.

Roses. 

Kasumi X felt herself stammering. &#147;A-Ayane...?

The clone shuddered delicately to the pulsation and dancing of her 
heart, trapped within its confinement. That anxiety was not misplaced 
at all, Ayane&#146;s breath lingered coolly on Kasumi X&#146;s lips. She stayed 
in place, frozen by indecision.    

Should she allow Ayane to kiss her?

There was no doubt that Kasumi X wanted this, after all, she had been 
more or less besotted with Ayane since they first met. But on the 
other hand, she had only met Ayane half a day ago. And she was 
obviously affected by the alcohol right now. Was this the right thing 
to do? If they did this would Ayane regret it? A split second later, 
Kasumi X realized that Ayane&#146;s hand was rested adroitly on her knee, 
the other hand had found its way to her cheek, gently stroking her 
tender, now flowering, cheeks. How long could she hold out? 

&#147;A-Ayane...&#148; Kasumi X stammered. &#147;Y-You shouldn&#146;t... you-mmmph!&#148;

Kasumi X&#146;s stuttered speech was interrupted as Ayane, bold and 
determined, pressed her lips up against those of the brunette. Her 
brown eyes widened with surprise and Ayane&#146;s astounding passion. The 
Hajin-mon ninja&#146;s hands tightened their soft yet firm grip on Kasumi 
X&#146;s body, making her let off a small, innocent sigh of contentment. 
Before she even knew it, Ayane was lowering Kasumi X into a lying 
position, spread out over her bed, all the while not breaking the 
kiss. It was hard for Kasumi X to take this all in. Just a short while 
ago, Ayane was ready to attack her. Now she was kissing with the sort 
of affection you&#146;d see from a 2-year long lover. It wasn&#146;t loving or 
delicate though. Ayane&#146;s touch was demanding, and desperate, almost 
pleading. It was as if Ayane had been waiting for this for some time. 
She was in no mood to entertain the possibilities anymore. She would 
seize what she wanted. 

That just happened to be Kasumi. 

Kasumi X got the message when Ayane pushed her tongue past her soft 
lips, entering the brown-eyed girl&#146;s mouth. Suddenly Kasumi X was 
reminded of what this all meant, what this all would lead to. In a 
reflex action, Kasumi X pulled away from Ayane&#146;s kiss with a gasp, 
quickly taking in air. Even though she felt she was ready for this, 
things were happening so quickly. 

Ayane cast her claret eyes at Kasumi X, who looked back up at her with 
honey brown ones. That haunting zeal and desperation in Ayane&#146;s eyes 
was alluring the clone in ways she could never really understand. 
But... was this right? 

&#147;Ayane...&#148; Kasumi X was finding her voice again. &#147;...Should...we...&#148;

The girl in question said nothing to respond to Kasumi X; rather she 
just left her hands slide down to either side of the clone, running 
them up and down Kasumi X&#146;s curvaceous body in seductive motions. 
Though all this, their eyes never separated from that stare shared 
between them and finally Kasumi X began to realize something. 

Ayane really wanted this. 

It was clear to see in her eyes. She was burning for Kasumi (X) and it 
had to be a feeling that had definitely been built up over time. 
Slowly, one of Kasumi X&#146;s soft hands came up against Ayane&#146;s soft 
pouting cheek, cradling it smoothly in a compassionate arc motion. 

She was so beautiful. 

Those tresses of short lilac hair. Those unfathomable pools of scarlet 
crystal eyes. That lithe, athletic but well-endowed body. Ayane&#146;s 
beauty was incomprehensible. All Kasumi X wanted to achieve in this 
lifetime now was Ayane&#146;s happiness. She realized that she was in love 
with Ayane; there was no denying it. Now it was time. 

She had to be one with her love. 

Kasumi X rose up a little, to move closer to Ayane. Without any 
hesitation or doubt, the auburn-haired ninja pressed her lips against 
Ayane&#146;s, releasing a soft little moan of joy. As Ayane began to kiss 
her back, Kasumi X parted her lips slightly, allowing Ayane&#146;s tongue 
entry into her mouth. Ayane did so, lowering Kasumi X&#146;s upper torso 
back down onto the bed evenly. Kasumi X clasped Ayane&#146;s cheeks with 
both hands, groaning lightly into her love&#146;s mouth. Though she was 
preoccupied with Kasumi X&#146;s lips, Ayane&#146;s hands nudged away from her 
sides easily, and then came up to the buckle of the shirt that the 
brown-eyed girl was wearing. Since Kasumi X really didn&#146;t have any 
clothes of her own, she had borrowed some of Ayane&#146;s during the night 
without telling her. Ayane didn&#146;t care much about that now though. 

While Ayane fumbled recklessly to undo the buckle over her lover&#146;s 
shirt, Kasumi X&#146;s hands ran up to Ayane&#146;s back, which was sported 
delectable, unguarded flesh. Kasumi X slowly dragged her hands along 
and down the path of Ayane&#146;s neck, running up into her short lavender 
hair. Ayane then left of a sigh of success as her fingers undid the 
tight buckle over Kasumi X&#146;s small shirt. Rather than completely take 
it off, Ayane left it undone and began a leisurely, consuming caress 
of her lover&#146;s left breast. Kasumi X breathed in sharply, as Ayane 
broke off from their kiss, but instantly she was nuzzling her mouth 
against the nape of the brunette&#146;s neck. Kasumi X&#146;s neckline was 
overwhelmed with gentle butterfly kisses, every so often they would be 
followed by a quick nip of her flesh. 

Kasumi X wriggled around on the bed whilst Ayane continued her 
angel-like motions, occasionally letting out a brief gasp of 
excitement. While she heard Kasumi (X) breathe like that, Ayane just 
grinned. She could feel Kasumi X&#146;s pink nipples harden under the 
fabric of her shirt, through each second. Through all the elegance of 
a ninja, Ayane little by little began a trail of short; feather light 
kisses along Kasumi X&#146;s neck, then down along to the cleft of Kasumi 
X&#146;s striking breasts. She grinned playfully once more, then pulled off 
Kasumi X&#146;s shirt completely, revealing globes of flesh that Ayane had 
at her mercy. Ayane lowered her head slightly, just smiling at the 
other woman long enough to see that cute look of longing in her eyes. 
She hovered over Kasumi X&#146;s right breast for a short few moments, and 
then seized its nipple between her soft lips. Kasumi X&#146;s gave off a 
tender moan as Ayane began a greedy suckling of her rigid pink nub. 
Kasumi X felt her body tremble. This was her first time, so she knew 
that this was going to be an incredible experience, but she had never 
expected something like... this. While Kasumi X&#146;s head lulled back, 
savouring Ayane&#146;s lips upon her breast, Ayane herself continued her 
actions, flicking her nipple with her hot tongue.  

Ayane continued take Kasumi X&#146;s with more of a possessive nature, 
picking up the tempo of her kissing and nibbling. As Kasumi X&#146;s 
reactions became more frequent, Ayane&#146;s free hand found its way over 
to Kasumi X&#146;s other soft mound, exquisitely kneading it with sleek 
fingers. Before long, Ayane&#146;s index and middle fingers had worked 
their way around Kasumi X&#146;s left nipple, rubbing it between then 
quickly. The clone continued to moan softly, with a light feeling of 
butterflies within her. Ayane&#146;s touch drove her crazy. And it was 
understandable why. Ayane&#146;s ruthless sucking was so forceful that a 
trail of her saliva trickled down the curve of Kasumi X&#146;s breast. 
Gradually Kasumi X began to realize that there was a wetness setting 
in between her legs. 

Shortly afterwards, Ayane broke off from Kasumi X&#146;s pink, 
saliva-coated nub, while the other hand relinquished its hold over the 
other. Ayane moved upward slightly, coming face to face with Kasumi X. 
Instantly she kissed her, her hands now seeking out a new goal. Her 
lissom hand stroked at Kasumi X&#146;s sides, along her stomach, then down 
to her most private area, the curve of her crotch. Kasumi X&#146;s eyes 
went wide when she felt Ayane&#146;s electric touch against her sex. It was 
covered by a small set of panties that Ayane had lying around, which 
were already dampening due to Kasumi X&#146;s excitement. The Woman Tengu 
pulled away from Kasumi&#146;s lips and smiled at the girl&#146;s shock, only to 
see the brunette&#146;s eyes widen even further when Ayane began to rub. 

Ayane kissed Kasumi once more, muffling the clone&#146;s cries as her hand 
moved up and down the arc of her sex. That small patch of wetness on 
Kasumi X&#146;s panties became larger and larger as time went on, and a 
musky fragrance began to fill the room. Ayane&#146;s disposed hand snaked 
down to Kasumi X&#146;s waist, struggling to fully undo the buttons of her 
jeans-shorts. It was then that Kasumi X understood that Ayane was 
trying to undress her, and she followed suit, stripping Ayane of her 
own bonds of clothing. Time pressed on, and Ayane finally stopped 
kissing Kasumi X enough to concentrate fully on undressing her, 
likewise for her lover. Soon the only article of clothing left between 
them was the set of ashen white panties encompassing Kasumi X&#146;s 
clandestine folds.  

Ayane shimmed down Kasumi&#146;s body, dragging her own naked breasts along 
her curves in a startlingly sexy manner. She placed light kisses at 
her waist and legs, gliding her hands along them equally. Finally, she 
reached her goal; the glorious nether region that existed between 
Kasumi X&#146;s nimble legs. Ayane marvelled at it, it glistened with 
droplets of Kasumi X&#146;s wetness. There was no telling how many people 
have desired to be in the position she was in now. But Kasumi was 
hers. Kasumi belonged to her...

Kasumi X breathed slowly, feeling Ayane&#146;s warm breath on her lowest 
area. Just when she thought Ayane could take her no further, her heart 
skipped a beat as she felt the lilac-haired ninja&#146;s tongue drive 
itself along the crease of her sex. Kasumi X cried out loudly, not 
having the power to restrain herself, whilst her love&#146;s hot digit 
successively dragged itself up her slit. The clone saw stars as Ayane 
took her. Never before had she felt something like this. Her hips 
shook violently underneath Ayane&#146;s pressure, and her brown eyes rolled 
lustfully as that tongue took her to places she would have never even 
believed possible. Ayane delved, licked and sucked at Kasumi X&#146;s 
nether lips, coming upwards in a sleek way, savouring the velvety 
softness. She brought one of her hands to Kasumi X&#146;s lower lips, 
separating them with middle and index fingers, and then thrust her 
tongue up inside her ninja lover.  

Kasumi X bit her lip to keep herself from screaming, when Ayane probed 
in and out of her, exploring and tasting the tantalizing inner flesh 
that existed within. Reflexively, Kasumi&#146;s body arched in pleasure, 
she was far beyond controlling herself. Her legs tightened around 
Ayane&#146;s head, her hands running into lavender hair and forcing the 
woman&#146;s head further between her thighs. The feeling that Ayane gave 
her was indescribable, so much so that she was not ready for what 
Ayane did next. Without warning, Ayane slid her tongue up Kasumi X&#146;s 
wet cerise opening and instantly wrapped it around the clone&#146;s 
vulnerable clit. 

That was the one that drove Kasumi X over the edge. The brown-haired 
girl&#146;s toe dug into the sheets of the bed, her foot standing on end, 
her body wracked with ecstasy as she reached her blessed climax. 
Kasumi X moaned hard with satisfaction, her closed eyes parting 
slightly while her sex gushed waves of milky cum onto the bed and 
Ayane&#146;s mouth. Kasumi X&#146;s body fell limp onto the springy bed once 
more, and slowly Ayane pulled her face from between the girl&#146;s legs. 
With half lidded eyes, Kasumi X looked over at Ayane who was smiling 
sweetly, a trail of Kasumi&#146;s own cum coming down the side of her mouth 
and rolling off her cheek. Before she knew what was happening, Ayane 
had her tongue down Kasumi X&#146;s throat, the clone eagerly relishing her 
own wetness from her own sopping sex. 

Kasumi X shivered giddily as Ayane had her way with her. This was all 
she could want in the world... she was with her &#145;new&#146; love...   

**********

Kasumi X sighed gently as rays of bright sunshine from the slightly 
parted curtains of the window crossed her face with their warmth. She 
stirred a little, and then awoke, beaming a smile of joy after 
realizing where she was. Just beside her was Ayane&#146;s sleeping form, 
still completely naked save for the protective grasp that Kasumi X had 
around her waist. The clone nuzzled closer to her lover, holding onto 
her tight, as if letting Ayane go would lose her forever.  

After last night... a new ray of hope filled the duplicate ninja. 
Ayane was hers now. They could build a future together. Start 
something special. They had all the time in the world. 

{Maybe I should do something nice for her...} The ginger-brown haired 
girl thought privately. {Before she wakes up.}

After giving her lover one last kiss to the cheek, Kasumi X ruffled 
upwards and pulled away the bed sheets, standing up. She then gathered 
together her clothes that had been tossed aside recklessly during last 
night&#146;s event and then put them on, clothing her lithe body once more. 

Kasumi X threw one last happy gaze at Ayane, her sweet, sleeping angel 
and then walked through the door of the bedroom, into the living room. 

An hour later, Kasumi X was in the kitchen again, pouring herself a 
glass of water. She had been thinking about what happened that night 
and she realized something. These feelings she had for Ayane were much 
more serious than she first believed them to be. It was strange, at 
first, all Kasumi X really wanted was to learn more about the past she 
could not recall, she had no idea things were going to get this 
serious. Though she felt this statement was being made prematurely, 
the clone was beginning to feel like she was falling in love. 

After finishing her water, Kasumi X set the glass into the sink, and 
looked around to see Ayane standing in the doorway. She was awake. But 
Kasumi X was oddly ignorant of the unsettled look in Ayane&#146;s eyes. 

&#147;Morning.&#148; She said delicately.

Ayane was not quick to reply. &#147;...Kasumi.&#148;

The clone ninja continued. &#147;I know we got off to a rough start but 
we... have so much time now.&#148;

&#147;Look...&#148; Ayane tried hard to be as polite about this as she could. 
&#147;You should know...that-&#147;   

Kasumi X pursued with her comments, not realizing that Ayane was 
trying to say something to her. &#147;I really care about you. Since I 
first saw you... Ayane. Now we can-&#147;

Ayane cut Kasumi X off. &#147;Will you listen to me!?&#148; She yelled. &#147;Last 
night... it was a mistake. It shouldn&#146;t have happened and it&#146;ll never 
happen again.&#148;

Just like that, Kasumi X&#146;s unborn, crystal world shattered into a 
thousand tiny pieces. Through only a few short words in a few short 
seconds, all her hopes had been dashed. 

She felt the tears already welling up in her eyes already. &#147;B-But last 
night... you said that... that you loved me...&#148;

&#147;I-I was drunk.&#148; Ayane didn&#146;t lie very well, but it was working. She 
quite clearly remembered saying that. &#147;It meant... nothing.&#148;

Kasumi X&#146;s sadness became desperation. &#147;I don&#146;t believe that! I know 
you feel the same way I do!&#148;

She couldn&#146;t stand it. That glance of heartbreak in Kasumi X&#146;s eyes. 
Instantly, Ayane turned around, looking away from her &#145;mistake&#146;. 
&#147;Leave.&#148;

Kasumi X suddenly felt lost. Ayane was asking her to... &#147;...What?&#148;

Ayane became sterner. &#147;I said I want you to leave. Now. Get out.&#148;

&#147;No!&#148; The other girl bellowed. &#147;I won&#146;t let you just walk away from 
this!&#148;

And that stern hand of Ayane reverted into anger. She cast a dark, 
livid gaze at Kasumi X over her shoulder, frightening the clone with 
her sudden change in attitude. &#147;It&#146;s not your choice! Now get the hell 
out!&#148;

Kasumi X shrank from that outburst. Not only was Ayane rejecting her 
love but also she was infuriated with it. Ayane was actually incensed 
by her. There was no way she could stay here if Ayane was so willing 
to have her out. Kasumi X bolted past Ayane quickly, her tears falling 
in the air as she ran through the door into the living room. She 
fumbled to unlock the bolts on the front door, her sobbing distracting 
her from it. With some effort she managed to open the door and then 
run through it, not even bothering to look back. 

Ayane leaned back on the kitchen wall, her heartstrings grazed from 
those muffled cries of Kasumi&#146;s. Slowly she slid to the floor, 
clutching at the sides of her arms, struggling to stop herself from 
chasing after Kasumi (X). 

She didn&#146;t regret last night. She didn&#146;t regret it at all.
