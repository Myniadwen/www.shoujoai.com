Katsuragi Forest, Osaka Prefecture, Japan

Katsuragi Forest was an odd place.

The serenity and beauty of it wasn&#39;t very telling of the vast numbers of 
minute disturbances and significant events that often took place inside 
its expanses of greenery. From an overhead view that same sentiment 
would have been felt once more. But then to do so would overlook the 
fact that something else had happened inside Katsuragi Forest to expand 
upon that list. A union of sorts. A physical union between two kunoichi 
-- a union of flesh provoked by tears, regret, compulsion and at that 
one great temptation to the psyches of both man and woman; sheer, 
unadulterated, primitive human lust.

The central clearing in the heartland of Katsuragi Forest was the point 
of that connection. All the animals that would have normally grazed or 
foraged for food there had gone. The flames of the campfire had burned 
themselves into submission with nothing now left of them aside from a 
small rising whiff of smoke emanating from a few puckering embers. Two 
female shinobi lay together astride that burned-out campfire. Those 
shinobi were the honey brown-haired Kasumi and the lily lavender-haired 
Ayane. Both were asleep. Both were adorned in nakedness. They faced each 
other in slumber whilst lying together on a soft patch of grass that had 
been smoothed out over the course of their night together. And around 
them in disorganized, scattered piles were their clothes, which had been 
torn off each other&#39;s bodies and tossed aside just as easily.

By now the moon had fallen to the sun. Its rays of beautiful golden 
light filtered through the gaps between the surrounding trunks of the 
many trees and illuminated the bodies of the two women. In the distance 
were the gentle chirps and cries of the woodland animals as they 
scurried along the bushes and trees for the beginning of a new day. 
Besides that, all was quiet in the clearing; although it did not remain 
that way for long. A soft, broken moan stemmed from the crux of Kasumi&#39;s 
throat. Her limber legs shifted against themselves in the coolness of 
the morning breeze -- but the climate of her surroundings was the last 
thing on her mind at this point. Her long eyelashes fluttered open and 
the melancholy ninja cast her gaze on the exquisite creature lying next 
to her.

Ayane.

That palpable throbbing she had felt in her heart since their encounter 
yesterday made its unconditional return the moment that Kasumi dared to 
stare at her. She was still asleep, her arms and hands brought together 
at her chest in a manner that Kasumi could only describe correctly with 
the word &#39;adorable&#39;. It was at serene times like these when Ayane was 
her least threatening. And when Ayane was seen in that light it was 
impossible to discern her natural beauty from who she was. Kasumi didn&#39;t 
often get the chance to see her rival in this way very often. But when 
she did... it had an empowering effect on her. At least enough of one to 
allow her to be more honest about herself than what was normally 
possible. A small and frigid smile was pulled from the Mugen-Tenshin 
Tenjin-mon ninja when she slowly brought up her hand and reached out to 
Ayane&#39;s head. Kasumi carefully and attentively ran her fingers through 
the thin strands of the girl&#39;s lilac tresses, staring breathlessly into 
her calm expression and listening openly to Ayane&#39;s soft breathing. In 
and out, in and out. Eventually Kasumi&#39;s ministrations descended into a 
caress of the cheek. She pressed her hand into that supple flesh and 
stroked it contentedly; completely forgetting where she was and how 
little control she had over her current surroundings. In her heart; 
Kasumi truly felt like that sole moment could have lasted a lifetime. 
Yet such serene moments have their zenith -- as all do. That one hit its 
pinnacle the second a scrambled groan echoed from Ayane&#39;s lips.

Kasumi&#39;s smile fell immediately.

When Ayane&#39;s eyes began to flutter open, the brown-haired one retracted 
her hand from the girl&#39;s cheek like she hand been burned. And when it 
dawned on her that Ayane was about to awaken, the natural realities 
(like her nakedness and the unsafe confides of the forest) came to her. 
Tired red eyes broke open abruptly; and soon enough they locked with 
nervous brown ones.

&quot;I-I didn&#39;t mean to wake you.&quot; Kasumi affirmed gawkily.

&quot;...W-where...?&quot; There was a slight disorientation on Ayane&#39;s part. Then 
a flash of realization passed through her eyes and she leaned up from 
the grass. She covered her bared breasts with one arm and clutched at 
her skull with the other, muttering with a sigh, &quot;Oh, Kami-sama...&quot;

Kasumi shielded her breasts in the same manner and brought herself up 
also. &quot;Ayane, we...&quot;

&quot;...Don&#39;t say a word.&quot;

If there was a helium balloon that represented Kasumi&#39;s current 
elevation, it would have started deflating right at that instant. She 
lowered her head sadly and looked away, her medium long mane of brown 
hair waving around her shoulders. Ayane had untied it from its normal 
ponytail last night and now Kasumi was thankful for it because her bangs 
succeeded in hiding the disappointment in her eyes. Ayane tightened her 
hand into a fist. One that was shaking. But she ignored that about 
herself and looked upwards, away from the dejected kunoichi to her 
right. Ayane squinted at the skies and evaluated something. Between the 
branches and foliage of the overhanging trees she could just about make 
out the height of the sun from this point. Judging but that alone, she 
could tell that it was around eight in the morning. Maybe a little 
later.

After checking out that one thing, Ayane wordlessly lifted herself off 
the grass patch against Kasumi and went about picking her discarded 
clothes up off the ground. Kasumi noticed the movement and spoke, if 
only from force of habit. &quot;What are you doing...?&quot;

Ayane didn&#39;t look back. &quot;...What does it look like?&quot;

&quot;I knew it...&quot; Kasumi tilted her head sadly once more, &quot;...you&#39;re going 
to run away from this, aren&#39;t you...?&quot;

The Woman Tengu emotionlessly grabbed one of her purple leggings. 
&quot;There&#39;s... nothing to run away from.&quot;

&quot;Yes there is...&quot; Kasumi stared at the girl&#39;s back. &quot;...We made love...&quot;

Ayane&#39;s shoulders jerked. But there was no reply to that one. After 
stopping for a moment, she stepped across to grab the red panties that 
rested next to Kasumi&#39;s bandaged ankle. It escaped neither woman&#39;s 
notice that there was a large and noticeable wet patch there -- with a 
most telling odour of vaginal discharge. You couldn&#39;t score points in 
this kind of situation but the look on Ayane&#39;s face more or less said 
who landed the goal right there. Kasumi, however, was far beyond that. 
Pride was no more on her mind, either. &quot;You made love to me, Ayane. We 
were together... that way. You... can&#39;t pretend like this isn&#39;t 
happening!&quot;

Ayane froze but she didn&#39;t turn around. Or speak.

Yet Kasumi was unabated. &quot;Please just talk to me!&quot;

&quot;Look just back off, alright!&quot; Ayane growled, &quot;I can&#39;t... deal with this 
right now.&quot;

There was silence after that; if only occasionally broken by the chirps 
of the distant birds. Yet that pleasant sound of woodland fauna did 
nothing to quash the notably unpleasant lack of verbal exchange between 
Ayane and Kasumi. After a few seconds of it, Ayane marched around the 
campfire and continued picking up all of her tossed articles of 
clothing. Kasumi stayed hushed throughout all of it. She merely drew her 
knees up against her chest and swallowed the lump in her throat. 
Considering that she herself was also naked, that might have seemed 
slightly odd. But the truth was that neither of them was thinking very 
clearly in all of this.

Yet there was enough ill-gotten confidence in Kasumi to utter a 
half-scathing, half-impotent remark. &quot;...And you always call me the 
&#39;coward&#39;.&quot;

Ayane froze in place once again, just whilst reaching the red and gold 
robes that normally forged the bow around her waist. The hand that 
sought out its fabric clutched into a fist. And she turned around 
angrily, finally allowing herself to make eye contact with the other 
girl.

&quot;You think this is easy for me!&quot; She shouted, &quot;You don&#39;t understand 
anything!&quot;

Kasumi looked up at her insolently. &quot;How can I understand you if you 
won&#39;t let me!&quot;

A stalemate. Ayane stared angrily at Kasumi while Kasumi looked back 
defiantly. The stand off didn&#39;t last long either, however. The moment 
than Ayane looked away, she turned her back fully and clammed up. Kasumi 
couldn&#39;t read her like that. Her Ki was so out of whack from last night 
that trying that in itself would be impossible. And right now she was in 
no fit state to assess what was going through Ayane&#39;s mind. Aside from 
Genra, hardly anyone could. The auburn-haired kunoichi sighed and rose 
up from the smoothed patch of grass that herself and Ayane had slept on. 
Then she did as Ayane had done, going for her clothes. Ayane resumed 
that action herself.

The time re-dressing was again spent in silence. No talk of where they 
went from here, what their feelings were, what their feelings meant, 
nothing. When the two women had gotten their clothes back on, the 
silence between them was starting to seem less... unpleasant. For there 
was a preoccupation on Ayane&#39;s mind and an unwillingness to rock the 
boat from Kasumi&#39;s perspective. So Kasumi acted out on the first thing 
that came to mind.

Immediately she closed her eyes and made the two-fingered sign of the 
shinobi. Then she used her hands to make a series of fluid and 
highly-coordinated gestures. The final sign she invoked clamped her 
hands together. Her honeysuckle eyes opened and the complexities of her 
ninja-honed vision were taken to a new extreme. Kasumi&#39;s eyes focussed 
unblinking with the sight of a third eye, her Mind&#39;s Eye. That enhanced 
prescience brought a vivid picture of the green terrain around her for a 
good 300m distance. No more than 20 metres away was the thing she was 
looking for. A water source.

Ayane noted the technique but was ignorant of the need. &quot;...The hell are 
you doing?&quot;

Kasumi&#39;s eyes rolled in their sockets for a moment. Then she released 
the sign made by her hands and started walking forwards, albeit 
gingerly, thanks to the shuriken that had slashed her across the ankle 
yesterday morning. &quot;There&#39;s a clean river nearby. I need to bathe and 
drink.&quot;

She continued walking down the forest past leading out from the smoky 
remains of the campfire. But she stopped when she realized that Ayane 
wasn&#39;t following her. Kasumi blinked and looked over her shoulder at 
Genra&#39;s future successor with an almost expectant glare. Ayane stared 
back at her without uttering a word. The pair of them observed each 
other for a moment, until the intent dawned on Ayane. She heaved a sigh 
of defeat and started walking forwards; brushing past Kasumi with a 
slurred, &quot;Get outta the way.&quot;

When the other girl followed behind, Ayane couldn&#39;t help but take note 
of the throbbing in her chest. &#39;...Damnit...&#39; She thought irritably.

----------

The powers of Ki, harnessed by the techniques of either house of the 
Mugen-Tenshin style, could never fail in a tight situation. There was 
indeed a source of water deeper into the forest. And Kasumi&#39;s sight had 
been accurate in its location. She might not have been at the peak of 
her ability at the moment (for more than one reason) but this was the 
least she could do for herself. And to a greatest extent, for Ayane. 
Kasumi had been the one to follow Ayane to the location of the water 
source. In the end it turned out to be a thin stream of spring water, 
less than a few metres wide. The Woman Tengu traced the tiny river 
merely with sound alone; after all the Hajin-mon style taught as many 
techniques for better sensory perception as the Tenjin-mon did. Judging 
by the length of it, Ayane had guessed that it cut through the entire 
forest for at least half a mile. Geographic memory kicked in too, and 
she also remembered that there was a larger river curving around the 
outline of the south-east edge forest which was probably interconnected 
with this one. Knowing that gave her a good idea of where she was right 
now; but that was only a thought that came from habitual assessments. A 
kunoichi had to know her surroundings and make them as her own. Yet this 
was only a distraction for her. Ayane&#39;s thoughts were far from fully 
concentrated on any of it.

Kasumi knew that without even guessing.

When the two reached the river, Kasumi went about her business while 
Ayane remained dreadfully stoic. In the three and a half minutes between 
leaving the campsite and getting here, the talk between them was at a 
zero. Yet Kasumi dealt with it by busying herself. The clothes she had 
put on earlier now had to come off again. Ayane settled by the trunk of 
an old tree in a slumped position, cracking her knuckles in a fidgeting 
manner, as if to distract herself from the sight of Kasumi undressing. 
Kasumi turned her back to the other woman and removed each article from 
her body. First came the blue wrist and shin guards. Then she pulled at 
the side-strings of top to pull it from her chest and waist. Along with 
it went the sheathed short sword. Kasumi soon after removed her shoes 
and rolled down both of the white leggings and removed them from her 
legs, allowing herself nakedness again save for her underwear. Finally 
she peeled off the &#39;bandage&#39; she had made for her injured ankle out of 
her clothes. The wound was healing by now thanks to the balm, the flesh 
re-sealing itself. But it still needed more time. So with a sigh she 
lowered herself into the babbling water stream. It wasn&#39;t very deep. In 
fact the water only reached about neck-high. But it was enough for now. 
It was better than walking around with blades of grass clinging to her 
back. Eventually she closed her eyes and just enjoyed the moment of 
washing herself, running her hands through her hair and pelting her face 
and skin with the morning-cool waters of the forest. It went on for over 
half an hour. Through that time Ayane held her fist and distracted 
herself in anyway she could, occasionally stealing glances of her rival 
from afar until her gaze settled on Kasumi alone. Then from the bushes a 
little pouting-cheek squirrel came shuffling out. It scurried up to the 
bank of the river in disjointed strides with its sight set on a little 
nut that rested near her. With a sad smile Kasumi swam (or rather 
walked, considering that her bare feet were touching the smooth pebbles 
underwater) to the bank of the stream and picked up that nut, holding it 
out in her hand.

&quot;C&#39;mon.&quot; She said softly.

The squirrel stood motionless (save for the tail) for a moment, then 
cautiously advanced on the nut in Kasumi&#39;s hand.

&quot;That&#39;s right, I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;

It couldn&#39;t have understood a lick of what she was saying. But animals 
could read feelings. And right now that squirrel was aware that Kasumi 
intended it no harm. So it hopped over to her open hand and began 
nibbling on the nut for sustenance. Which was when Kasumi giggled. It 
was faint enough to be ignored and drenched in enough sadness to come 
off as the beginning of a volley of tears, but she giggled. If for only 
a moment, she cleared her mind of what Ayane had brought to it (or 
awoken). Once the squirrel was done it scampered off into the bushes 
again. And Kasumi continued to bathe. All through that little scene; 
Ayane had been watching. As much as she hated to admit it, Kasumi had a 
kind of affinity for nature. It was obvious that she was as comfortable 
out here in the wilderness as she would be if she were in one of the 
cities. Even the animals liked her. Creatures like that judged humans by 
their souls and the Ki they give off; it clearly sensed security and 
kindness from Kasumi.

Ayane didn&#39;t know how she felt about that.

Did it make her angry? Did it upset her? Did it humour her?

Could she possibly have found it... endearing?

The Female Tengu didn&#39;t like the way her heart felt when she thought of 
it. Chalk it up to a system of Ki recovering from sex (makes for very 
obscured emotions, they say). Kasumi by now was busy braiding her hair 
back into a ponytail. She worked her fingers through the locks of her 
hair effortlessly -- until she turned around partially and asked,

&quot;Why are you staring at me?&quot;

Ayane&#39;s crimson orbs narrowed and darted to one side. &quot;...Don&#39;t flatter 
yourself.&quot;

&quot;Hmm. Cowardice...&quot; Kasumi said, &quot;such a strong word, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;What are you getting at?&quot;

&quot;Do I need to tell you...?&quot; She prodded.

The glare on Ayane&#39;s face grew irritable again. &quot;Go fuck yourself.&quot;

And the last thing the lavender-haired woman would have expected in 
reply to that would be a laugh. But that was what she got. A laugh. A 
chortled, offended and dull laugh. By the way it sounded you could tell 
that it didn&#39;t happen often. And so the silence returned. But by the 
time that Kasumi had finished braiding her hair into a ponytail, she was 
ready to break it.

&quot;...How is he?&quot;

Ayane finally looked back at her. &quot;...Who?&quot;

&quot;You know who I mean,&quot; Said the Tenjin-mon shinobi, &quot;my brother.&quot;

The thought of him made Ayane aware of her heartbeat again. &quot;...What 
exactly do you expect me to say? He&#39;s doing fine. Better than fine. 
There was a reason he was selected as leader of the Tenjin-mon before 
you were.&quot;

Kasumi frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t doubt his abilities to lead the group. I never 
have. No one is better for it than he is. It&#39;s one of the reasons I-&quot;

&quot;...You what? Ran away?&quot; Ayane suggested sardonically, &quot;But the words 
&#39;Kasumi&#39; and &#39;runaway&#39; go hand in hand, don&#39;t they?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll never understand me...&quot; She answered.

&quot;Like I give a damn,&quot; Remarked Ayane, &quot;You gave up your rights to him 
when you did it.&quot;

Kasumi stared hard at Ayane. &quot;And to you as well...?&quot;

Quiet came once more. Ayane and Kasumi were left watching each other; 
Kasumi waiting for an answer and Ayane fumbling for some smart-ass 
comment to retort with. In the end Genra&#39;s successor heaved herself off 
her feet and stood upright, dusting the blades of grass from her 
clothing. &quot;This doesn&#39;t change anything. What happened last night was a 
mistake, got it? As soon as we get out of this forest we&#39;re gonna finish 
the fight. Understand?&quot;

Again, Kasumi cast her one of those sad, heartbreaking smiles. &quot;...As 
you wish.&quot;

----------

Five hours and twenty minutes had passed since Ayane and Kasumi lingered 
together at the stream that ran through the distances of Katsuragi 
Forest. But with the current climate between them, it would have felt 
like five years. At this point the two of them made their way northeast 
of the old campsite by leaping across the tree branches and tree tops. 
Branch after branch they leapt upon and thrust themselves off 
artistically, moving like blurred yet constant gusts of the wind, 
rustling the foliage and frightening the birds that dwelled near it. 
Ayane and Kasumi jumped together over the branches at a very similar 
pace and speed -- which was when it occurred to both of them that they 
had learned their outdoor survival training together. The basic skills 
like these were not allocated to a specific group within the 
Mugen-Tenshin (neither the Tenjin-mon nor the Hajin-mon) because they 
were taught at such a young age. It seemed like such a long time ago by 
now.

Especially for Ayane.

They still weren&#39;t talking to each other. But all that speak about 
Hayate had been like a bucket of ice water. And for some reason they 
couldn&#39;t bicker like before. While the two of them didn&#39;t speak to each 
other or even look at each other directly, one couldn&#39;t help but find 
herself stealing peeks of the other as they jumped together. But right 
now that behaviour was more common from Ayane than it was Kasumi. The 
Woman Tengu hazarded a glance to her left whilst vaulting to a new tree 
branch. She could see the expression on Kasumi&#39;s face. It wasn&#39;t very 
happy. That&#39;s not to say that Kasumi was always a bright and extravagant 
person in nature, but... this felt different somehow. Her frown was 
almost lacklustre in some ways. It probably couldn&#39;t be properly 
explained without seeing something of the kind -- but to Ayane it was an 
unusual curiosity for her. Unusual in the sense that... she actually 
found herself caring about it. And as if there was something in her mind 
she wanted to suppress, Ayane shook her head violently and steeled her 
expression into a hard one.

Kasumi called out in monotone voice. &quot;We should be nearing the edge of 
the forest soon.&quot;

A dark grin crossed Ayane&#39;s face and she sped up her jumping. Kasumi 
gasped when she saw Ayane flash past her deftly and leapt at one of the 
higher perches of the trees before them. The lavender-haired teen didn&#39;t 
even give herself the time to adjust to the new foothold before jumping 
higher to reach another one. Kasumi maintained her own pace but narrowed 
her eyes at that cautiously.

&quot;...A-Ayane!&quot; She yelled, &quot;The branches are less stable in this-&quot;

The Woman Tengu growled. &quot;Shut up!&quot;

It was strange how those two words, so simple in nature, could cut a 
person down. Kasumi silenced herself before she said anymore. Ayane 
continued to pick up speed between the branches until she braced her 
foot against a thinner one. It snapped the moment it bore the full brunt 
of the girl&#39;s weight -- and in her haste, she was too startled to react. 
Ayane lost her momentum and went screaming down southwards towards the 
forest floor.

Kasumi was aghast. &quot;Ayane!&quot;

A rush of adrenalin overtook her. Kasumi immediately resolved herself 
and darted down from her position, making her way below by striking into 
and launching off the opposing trunks of two parallel trees. But by the 
time she caught up with the falling Ayane it was too late. The red-eyed 
woman grunted violently and Kasumi cringed when the crash was heard. 
Ayane&#39;s body smashed through the raised roots of one of the mighty trees 
which softened the blow; but ultimately she landed across her back, neck 
and skull. Her body came to rest limply along the grassy floor with an 
alarmed Kasumi descending quickly to her side. Kasumi urgently tucked 
her hand underneath Ayane&#39;s neck and inspected her body.

She was bruised. And her eyes weren&#39;t open. &quot;Kami-sama! Ayane? Are you 
alright? Ayane?&quot;

The tears stared welling up again. Before any of them dropped from 
Kasumi&#39;s eyes, Ayane groaned weakly. Kasumi&#39;s moist eyes widened when 
Ayane opened hers. &quot;K-Kasumi?&quot;

&quot;...You&#39;re okay...&quot;

Ayane remained noiseless for a moment then pulled a dark grimace. She 
shoved herself out of Kasumi&#39;s embrace, yelling &#39;get your hands off me!&#39; 
Even after a fall like that, one which would have killed a normal human 
being, she was still conscious of her close proximity with Kasumi. The 
chestnut-haired woman felt herself forced against the tree roots that 
Ayane had broken in the midst of her fall. Ayane held a hand to her head 
and stood upright. She started walking slowly forwards but her steps 
both looked and felt awkward. A throbbing set into her skull and the 
Hajin-mon kunoichi ambled to a stop. Kasumi noticed it. Ayane exhaled 
hard and tried to start walking again. But the moment she looked ahead 
of her the dense forest path ahead was looking distorted. Wooziness 
overtook her head. Her crimson eyes rolled with disorientation and her 
vision became blurred.

Kasumi was now aware that something actually was wrong. &quot;...Ayane...?&quot;

She couldn&#39;t reply. Ayane could only look over her shoulder and cast a 
defiant glare, before her eyes rolled back and she collapsed to the 
forest floor once again, slipping into a deep unconsciousness.

----------

&quot;That which is done out of love always takes place beyond good and 
evil.&quot; - Friedrich Nietzsche

----------

When she regained consciousness, the first thing Ayane realized was that 
her body was tingling. Like someone else&#39;s Ki was at work inside it. And 
to be true with her feelings, her eyes opened to see what was happening. 
What came to her immediately was the sight of Kasumi and Kasumi alone. 
She was kneeling astride Ayane&#39;s body with one of her hands making the 
two fingered sign again. Golden spiritual energies were surrounding both 
of them. Those energies were Kasumi&#39;s manifest Ki. The brown-haired teen 
had her eyes closed. And after a fixed period of time the Ki started to 
fade from both Ayane&#39;s body and her own. When that happened, Kasumi 
opened her eyes once more and looked down. She was more than surprised 
to see that Ayane was conscious again.

&quot;You&#39;re... awake...?&quot;

Ayane now took deeper notice of her surroundings. They were still in 
Katsuragi Forest. That fact hadn&#39;t changed. But this was clearly a 
different area. The trees around here were thinner than those before; 
which probably meant that they were nearing the exit out of the whole 
place. There were also more shrubs and flowers along the ground, if that 
meant anything. The most obvious difference now though was that it was 
dark. Night had fallen while she was out of it. Which also meant that 
she had been unconscious for at least half a day. A short distance from 
the two of them was another campfire. This time there was another set of 
sticks fixed up in a makeshift manner to cook up two fish, ones that had 
probably come from the stream they had passed by in the morning.

Kasumi looked at Ayane as she acclimated herself. &quot;I did a spell just 
now. From the looks of things you don&#39;t have any broken bones -- but 
still, I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a good idea for you to be moving around 
right now. The edge of the forest is less than two kilometres away. We 
should be out of here by noon tomorrow. Though we could have made it by 
nightfall... you need to rest for a while.&quot;

&quot;Did...&quot; Ayane blinked, &quot;...you carry me here?&quot;

Kasumi&#39;s head lulled. &quot;I am sorry... perhaps I should have asked you for 
your permission first, but you were...&quot;

Despite her nature, that comment didn&#39;t ring well in Ayane&#39;s ears. It 
actually sounded... almost a little ridiculous. But it really wasn&#39;t 
considering how the red-eyed woman had been acting of late. Still that 
wasn&#39;t Ayane&#39;s chief concern. It surprised her, that&#39;s all. Kasumi had 
really carried her all this way? If the exit out of the forest was less 
than two kilometres away then Kasumi had covered a hell of a lot of 
terrain with Ayane in her arms... but why...? And why after what 
happened...?

&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Asked Ayane.

Kasumi raised her head at that. &quot;...Do what?&quot;

&quot;Carry me here...&quot; The Female Tengu looked down, &quot;You should have just 
left me behind. I was the one who screwed up like that...&quot;

The runaway shinobi pressed her palms into her lap. &quot;...I would never do 
that... especially not after what... we...&quot;

Ayane gave out a small smile, despite herself. &quot;You&#39;re so na&#139;ve...&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re so stubborn.&quot; Kasumi said in reply.

There was another silence after that. But for some reason, neither Ayane 
nor Kasumi could quite rightly begrudge it. The crackling of the fire 
and the hoots of the nocturnal animals added to the serene feeling of 
the forests around them. It had a calming effect on Ayane in particular 
that it did not have before. Before she knew it, she was rolling over to 
her side to get more rest -- still maintaining that small smile. Sleep 
did not come as easily. She spent a good thirty minutes trying to reach 
it. And when she was halfway there, she found herself with what was 
becoming a welcomed intrusion. A pair of thin arms wrapped themselves 
around her lower waist. They belonged to Kasumi. The blood rushed to 
Ayane&#39;s cheeks when it happened, and even more so when the girl&#39;s body 
was spooned against her own.

&quot;What are you... doing?&quot; Ayane asked lightly.

Kasumi tightened her possessive hold around Ayane&#39;s gentle waist. 
&quot;Can... can I just hold you for a little while...? Please?&quot;

Ayane said neither yes nor no. Neither did she move from the spot. She 
remained as she was and shut her eyes, fully conscious of the body heat 
pressing against her back. She was confusing herself about it all. Truth 
be told however, Ayane was not the only one to realize that her heart 
was softening.

Kasumi&#39;s embrace made that all too frank.

End of Chapter Two 

Kaiser&#39;s Afterthoughts

Meh. I&#39;m not satisfied with the way this came out. But at the same time, 
I&#39;m comfortable enough with it to let it slide this time. Right now I&#39;ve 
seen my writing style hit a kind of &#39;stagnation&#39; in itself -- I just 
don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve improved at all in the past three months. The main 
reason I started writing fanfiction was to motivate myself out of this 
slump, which is important as I do intent to start writing something to 
be published in the later half of the year.

There was a scene in between Ayane&#39;s unconsciousness and her waking up; 
but for more than one reason I left it out and added a quote instead. If 
Ayane&#39;s change in attitude seemed somehow abrupt then now you know why 
-- but once I write a lemon version of this fic I&#39;ll add that scene.
