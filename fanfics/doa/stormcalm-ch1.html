<h1>The Storm Before the Calm</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../doa/index.html">Dead or Alive</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/gloob2k.html">Gloob2K</a><br> </h2>
<pre>AN: Well, this is my first fanfic ^-^ I hope you guys like it, Chapter
two is coming out soon. Please read and review!


Two blurs darted across the forest floor. Moving at supernatural
speeds, they weaved in and out of each other&#39;s paths, in a seemingly
deadly game of chicken. Then, just like that, the blurs stopped in the
middle of the clearing. As the dust cleared, it was evident that the
blurs were actually people.

&quot;Ayane... please... don&#39;t endanger your life and go on!&quot;

The purple-haired girl snorted and placed her hands on her hips in a
taunting pose, &quot;You can&#39;t boss me around, Kasumi. I hate you. You know
that. It is useless trying to reason with me...&quot;

&quot;I care about you, sister. I always have, and always will...&quot; Kasumi
said.

Ayane smirked and then back flipped, so quick that the whole motion was
done in under a second. Kasumi sidestepped even faster. Ayane&#39;s kicking
feet missed her face by millimeters.

&quot;Please!&quot; Kasumi begged, &quot;Going on is too dangerous! Don&#39;t endanger
your life!&quot;

Ayane&#39;s eyes were like fire as she aimed a punch at the bridge of
Kasumi&#39;s little nose. Kasumi jerked her head back just in time and hit
Ayane&#39;s fist away.

&quot;Listen to me, sister! Don&#39;t throw your life away!&quot;

Ayane snarled and tried to punch Kasumi&#39;s face again. Kasumi
disappeared and reappeared behind Ayane. Ayane braced for the surely
oncoming hit. She was caught out of position, out of rhythm... but the
blow never came. Ayane looked back. There was her sister.

&quot;Idiot...&quot; Ayane spat, &quot;You should&#39;ve hit me when you had the chance.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt you, Ayane. Please...&quot;

Ayane watched with satisfaction as Kasumi fell to the ground. She was
too quick for Kasumi this time. As Kasumi&#39;s last cry &quot;Please!&quot; echoed
through the forest, Ayane felt a brief stab of regret.

&lt;No. I must kill Genra myself. Kasumi, you will not stop me.&gt;

Taking Kasumi&#39;s tanto, Ayane admired it for a second before plunging it
deep into Kasumi&#39;s chest. Ayane didn&#39;t know what was worse, being
stabbed in the chest or looking into her sad brown eyes... as they
closed...

Ayane bowed her head for a second, then turned on her heel and walked
away.


&quot;Hey, take it easy!&quot; A familiar voice cried out.

&quot;Who...&quot; Kasumi gasped.

&quot;Its me, Leifang...&quot;

&quot;Wha-&quot;

&quot;You were defeated, Kasumi...&quot; Leifang said, stroking Kasumi&#39;s hair
back. She was so pretty... her long hair... her large brown eyes...

&quot;I... I remember...&quot; Kasumi gasped weakly, &quot;Where...&quot;

&quot;My summer retreat, Kasumi. We were in a remote area, and I didn&#39;t know
where else to take you... I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Kasumi moaned, taking Leifang&#39;s hand, &quot;Thanks...&quot; a brief smile
flashed across Kasumi&#39;s face as she finally lapsed into a deep sleep.

Leifang sat by the bedside, holding Kasumi&#39;s limp hand in her own. She
was going to live, thank god, even though that sword passed within bare
millimeters of her heart. A full recovery was going to be expected...

Leifang&#39;s glance grazed over to Kasumi&#39;s body... she had to strip
Kasumi down to her underwear to treat her... and she was the only one
that could&#39;ve helped her fast enough... a bloodstained white bandage
was

Her gaze strayed to her cleavage... rising and falling with every
breath... her tummy, flat and perfect... her slightly shapely legs, her
small adorable feet and toes... she was perfect, in every way...
Leifang didn&#39;t know what was more deadly. A knife in the chest, or
falling in love with Kasumi. She didn&#39;t know if she would ever fully
recover.


&quot;Ohhh...&quot; Kasumi muttered as she awoke. It was early afternoon, judging
from the sun, and Leifang was nowhere to be seen.

Kasumi slowly propped herself up on her elbows and looked around at
Leifang&#39;s summer retreat. A few stray books lay across the floor, but
the floor was clean. The air smelled of jasmine and Kasumi thought she
could smell Chinese tea over on one side. Then Kasumi noticed that
Lei&#39;s cottage was one whole room, save the washroom. Almost guiltily,
Kasumi realized that she was sleeping in Leifang&#39;s bed as well, while
Leifang spent her nights on her couch.

Kasumi spent a few more minutes admiring the Chinese decor when she
began to wonder where her saviour was. Obviously not in the house, as
the bathroom door was open, and Kasumi could see the rest of the
cottage. She had to be out-

There she was. Kasumi squinted to see Leifang sun tanning on her beach.
She was getting up and walking back to her cottage. Kasumi lay her head
back down on the pillow and partially closed her eyes, afraid that
Leifang would think that she was spying on her.

&quot;Ahh...&quot; Leifang said as she entered her cottage, linking her fingers
and stretching.

Kasumi couldn&#39;t help but stare with her partially open eyes at
Leifang... her long hair, usually braided, was loose... she looked so
cute... innocent... beautiful... Kasumi had never felt this way about
anyone before...

Leifang glanced at Kasumi, and decided she was still sleeping. She
walked up to a mirror and rebraided her hair before coming back to
Kasumi&#39;s bedside.

&quot;Kasumi...?&quot;

Kasumi opened her eyes. There she was. &quot;Lei...&quot;

&quot;Feeling better today?&quot; Leifang asked.

&quot;I...&quot; Kasumi didn&#39;t answer... not because she was to pained to speak,
but because Leifang was wearing a bikini.

&quot;If you&#39;re not feeling well... &quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m better,&quot; Kasumi said, making herself stare away. &quot;I... I think
I will try to walk now.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t go run off on me!&quot; Leifang teased, as she took the covers off
Kasumi.

&quot;Very funny,&quot; Kasumi said, lifting her head.

&quot;I think I need to give you something more substantial to wear,&quot;
Leifang smiled. &quot;Hang on for a sec,&quot; she said, walking off and opening
a dresser, rummaging for something that Kasumi could wear.

&quot;What about my old shirt?&quot; Kasumi asked, swinging her legs beside the
bed and sitting upright.

&quot;Too badly torn and bloodstained...&quot; Leifang said, still looking for
something.

Kasumi couldn&#39;t help but stare at Leifang&#39;s cute bottom as she rummaged
through the dresser.

&lt;Get a hold of yourself...&gt; Kasumi told herself.

&lt;It&#39;s so hard... could it be that I&#39;m...&gt; 

&lt;No! I&#39;ve never loved anyone like that before... especially not a wo-&gt;

&lt;It&#39;s time to face reality, Kasumi. You&#39;ve been in your shell for long
enough.&gt;

Leifang turned around, &quot;I don&#39;t think I have anything that
substantial... just lots of swimwear and some robes...&quot;

&quot;Its fine, I&#39;m around your size anyways...&quot; Kasumi said, as she, with
some effort, stood up. She steadied herself against the wall, and
slowly walked over to the dresser.

Leifang beamed, &quot;My, that was a fast recovery.&quot;

Kasumi smiled and scooted beside Leifang, picking out something for her
to wear. For some reason, she enjoyed being so close to Leifang... she
enjoyed her aura of warmth... cheerfulness...

On the other side of the dresser, Leifang was thinking similar
thoughts... she enjoyed being around Kasumi...

&quot;How bout this, Lei?&quot; Kasumi held up a black bikini.

&quot;I thought you liked pink,&quot; Leifang smiled, holding up a pink one.

&quot;Oh, its lovely, thank you so much...&quot; Kasumi said, accepting it.
&quot;Umm... where do I...&quot;

&quot;You can take a shower and change in the washroom, I&#39;ll meet you
outside, k?&quot;

&quot;K.&quot; Kasumi said, smiling and turning around, slowly walking to the
washroom. She closed the door and inhaled deeply. She loved the smell
of jasmine in the air. Slowly, she began to undress and examine herself
in the mirror.

The wound was ugly, but it could&#39;ve been worse. A lot worse. Kasumi
considered herself lucky to be alive... the would was dangerously close
to her heart. She gently washed off the dried blood that had
accumulated around the relatively small wound. Kasumi was actually
surprised at how small the wound was. A simple stab wound, but it
should&#39;ve been bigger. Kasumi&#39;s was only a inch long and less than a
millimetre wide. She turned on the hot water and stepped in the shower.


Leifang looked up. Ah, there she was.

&quot;Hello, Kasumi. You look a lot better now!&quot;

Kasumi walked up and sat down beside her, &quot;Thanks, Lei. Listen... I&#39;ve
never gotten a chance to say this... but... thanks, for everything
you&#39;ve done for me... if it weren&#39;t for you, I would be dead.&quot;

Leifang turned away for a second, almost embarrassed. She turned back
to Kasumi, &quot;I&#39;m sure you would&#39;ve done the same in my place, Kasumi.
Don&#39;t mention it.&quot;

Kasumi went on, &quot;And I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

Leifang looked at Kasumi quizzically, &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I slept in your bed... I used your facilities...&quot;

&quot;Oh... don&#39;t worry about it, Kasumi. It gets a little lonely out here
anyways, so I appreciate your company.&quot;

&quot;Thank you so much...&quot; Kasumi felt the compulsive urge to hug
Leifang... she looked so sweet, and she&#39;d done so much for her...

...but she was too late, Leifang was first. Leifang went up and wrapped
her arms around Kasumi&#39;s neck in a massive hug. Kasumi hesitated a
moment before wrapping her own arms around Leifang&#39;s waist, &quot;Thank you,
thank you so much,&quot; Kasumi whispered, letting the tears flow.


&quot;Hey Kas, wake up already!&quot; Leifang shouted cheerfully.

Kasumi opened her eyes. There she was, all dressed up already.

&quot;Its only...&quot;

&quot;Seven in the morning,&quot; Leifang said, &quot;Come on, don&#39;t make me go over
there and make you wake up.&quot;

&quot;A few more minutes...&quot; Kasumi said, throwing the covers over her face.

Leifang sighed and started walking over to the bed, &quot;Sleeping too much
isn&#39;t good for you, Kasumi...&quot;

Kasumi giggled from underneath the covers, &quot;I don&#39;t care! I need my
beauty rest!&quot;

Leifang sat down on the bed beside Kasumi, &quot;Don&#39;t make me...&quot;

&quot;Make you what?&quot; Kasmi giggled.

&quot;Tickle you out!&quot; Leifang suddenly shouted, quickly tickling Kasumi&#39;s
ribs.

&quot;Hheheheyy!!!&quot; Kasumi screamed, kicking her legs and thrashing around
wildly in an effort to avoid Leifang&#39;s tickling fingers, &quot;Nohohhat
fahair!!!&quot;

Leifang stopped and smiled, &quot;Did that get you awake?&quot;

Kasumi threw the covers off and sheepishly smiled, &quot;Fine! I&#39;m up!&quot;

Leifang giggled, &quot;Kay!&quot;, quickly tickling Kasumi&#39;s tummy before
skipping off to make breakfast.

&quot;I&#39;ll get you back for that!&quot; Kasumi screamed as she doubled up in
laughter again.

&lt;It&#39;s about time you fessed up to yourself, Kasumi... you&#39;re in love,
and she loves you back...&gt;

But what if I&#39;m wrong? It could ruin the friendship we&#39;ve built up...

&lt;You&#39;re saying you do love her?&gt;

Who wouldn&#39;t love someone like Leifang... someone as beautiful, kind
and caring...

&lt;Maybe she feels the same way about you...&gt;

I don&#39;t want to ruin everything... I&#39;m scared that I will if I tell
her...

&lt;What if she feels the same way about you? You may be hurting her.&gt;

I...

&lt;Better to do it now than to keep on hurting yourself... and her too..&gt;.

I... I&#39;ll see how it goes over the next few days...

&lt;You cannot afford to wait, Kasumi...&gt;

Kasumi shook the voices out of her head and got out of bed.
