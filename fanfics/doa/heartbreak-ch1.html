<h1>Heartbreaker (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../doa/index.html">Dead or Alive</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Noon, SHDP laboratory, Creutzwald Germany
-----------------------------------------

Beakers. Computers. Liquids in jars. More mindless, soulless pieces 
indicating technological prowess littered this place. Deep in the wild 
forests of borderline Germany, there was a laboratory for those 
belonging to the Super-human Development Project. Those scientists 
within the complex were some of the finest in the world. Their skills 
(on a scientific level) were unparalleled. 

These were the men responsible for the renowned Epsilon Project. 

Even though Project Epsilon was supposed to be a defining moment in 
their careers, it had ended in failure. The mind of the subject for 
use in the project, Hayate of the Mugen Tenshin, was too much for them 
to fully control. It was decided that he should be left for dead in 
the &#145;Black Forest&#146; as it is known. 

The millions spent on Project Epsilon and the failure that followed it 
meant that a whole new scheme had to be carried out. And through some 
great luck, they had done something that the science community and its 
seamy underworld had only dreamed of.

They successfully copied the DNA of a certain subject. That subject 
happened to be the sister of the previous sample, Kasumi. In other 
words, they had successfully cloned the most powerful female fighter 
on the face of the planet. 

The glass-eyed, white clothed scientists all smiled with glee as the 
huddled around their beautiful creation. Her body was suspended in a 
gelatinous substance, a very unusual form of suspension. 

One of the scientists spoke up. &#147;I cannot believe this. Although we 
have fallen out of favour for the failure of Project Epsilon, we have 
this little prize to fall back on.&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148; Another one concurred. &#147;I am interested to see how well her 
skills hold up to the data we collected from the original. It was 
unfortunate that we lost K-1. We will be hard pressed to find such 
a... fascinating sample.&#148;

The head scientist stopped in his tracks and looked at the jell-like 
case holding the clone in suspension. &#147;Back away.&#148; He said. &#147;She is 
about ready to awaken. If the subject sees all of us like this, she 
might suffer some trauma. It is very likely that she will have the 
memories that K-1 had before the cloning process.&#148;

The majority of the other scientists grumbled a bit to themselves, 
they were eager to see the fruits of their labour, but their leader 
did have a point. They unhurriedly left the room to leave the main 
scientist and the subject alone. The jell-like prison started to 
wobble as the clone&#146;s naked body thrashed about inside of it. Soon 
after, her head, swathed in beautiful, un-hindered locks of golden 
brown hair, peered out of the viscous substance. Following that, each 
of her limbs extended to their fullest and tore through her 
restraining incubator. Soon there was nothing holding her back as her 
lithe body burst out into freedom, and she fell forwards upon release, 
for the first time, she was using her muscles. 

The scientist above the clone tried to keep his attraction discrete 
enough to say this. &#147;Welcome. Welcome to the world that is now open to 
you... my dear.&#148;

**********

What... what happened? 

What is going on? ...What am I doing here? Why am I naked like this? I 
look up to that man hovering over me. His cold eyes... they frighten 
me. I should not be here...

I... feel strange about myself. I have memories. Of...parents...and a 
brother...and...a woman... 

I feel like I can... reach them somehow. To let them know that I am 
here, that I remember them. But something divides us all. And I feel 
like these memories of mine are not mine. Like they were...borrowed 
from something else. 

I try not to think about too much, I just hold my arms around myself 
to cover up my breasts in front of this man. I do not like the stares 
he gives me. I do not want to be here anymore. I want to get out. 

&#147;Where... am I...?&#148; My voice sounds weak. I must not have spoken for a 
while. The man above me just kneels down and faces me at eye level. 

&#147;You are in a small laboratory complex just south of a town called 
Creutzwald. Do you remember anything my dear?&#148;

I try to think, even though it worries me. &#147;I...cannot remember much.&#148;

The man nods. &#147;I see. Well, whatever you do remember, you can forget 
it all. You see my dear, you are a creation of the Super-human 
Development Project.&#148;

My spine runs cold from hearing that, but I don&#146;t know why. 

Super-human Development Project.

What is that? &#147;...W-What is that?&#148; I ask.

The man walks over to a large table across from me and assembles some 
things. They look like clothes. &#147;You are a product of that project. We 
at the Super-human Development Project enhance physical and mental 
abilities of human beings and increase their natural powers. Many of 
our &#145;clients&#146; see this as a way to raise up a new wave of powerful, 
subservient soldiers. But they are fools. I see our efforts as a new 
genesis for mankind.&#148; I hear him snicker. &#147;We can improve God&#146;s 
work...&#148;

So I was apart of the project? &#147;Why me...?&#148;

&#147;Because you are unique, my dear. Unlike my other endeavours, you were 
not enhanced. You were created. And you appear to be a perfect sample 
of the K-1. Identical in physical appearance... but do your skills 
surpass hers?&#148;

What? I was... born here? But... but how? Am I a... clone of something 
else? How is that possible? 

&#147;You&#146;re... lying, aren&#146;t you?&#148; I can feel my voice coming back to me. 
But I still sound so desperate. 

The man just continues to prepare those clothes for me. &#147;I am not 
lying to you, my dear. You are a clone of a ninja woman this group 
acquired a while back. We lost her, but we managed to extract a sample 
of her blood cells. Using our technology, we created you. You are 
Kasumi X. You will suit our purposes well.&#148;

I fell myself getting angry. I am not a toy for people to use. How can 
this man treat me like that? 

&#147;I will not be used.&#148; I say. 

And I can see my new determination bothers him. &#147;You have no choice. 
You are my creation; therefore you are my property. And your first 
mission will be to track down the original model and bring her back 
here. You will do so without fail.&#148;

How does he think he is to talk to me like that? I stand up, not even 
bothering to hide my nakedness anymore. 

I will not be used.

**********

A few hours later, a solitary figure dashes between the trees of a 
murky forest just outside of Creutzwald. It was Kasumi X. She darted 
quickly through the trees, desperate to escape the jurisdiction of the 
scientists. It was a battle to get away from that place, as it had 
many guards defending it as security. Luckily Kasumi X was cloned from 
someone as strong as the original Kasumi. With a lot of effort and a 
little luck, Kasumi X managed to flee from the laboratory.  

She had to escape.

**********

&#147;Oof!&#148;

With a tired groan, Ayane of the Mugen Tenshin Hajin Mon was thrust 
into the cool ashen snow of the White Storm. She wiped her jaw and 
scoped her crystal scarlet eyes back up to the woman who had defeated 
her. 

Kasumi. 

It was a long, even battle and at points, the tides looked as if they 
could have gone either way. But in the end, Kasumi came out the 
victor. The older fighter had bested Ayane into submission, and she 
stood above, silent, feigning that pathetic wall of innocence. 
&#147;Damn you...&#148; Ayane seethed that out. &#147;Damn you to hell...&#148;

Kasumi looked away. Almost as if those words had stung her. &#147;You can&#146;t 
defeat me. So please stop trying, Ayane. Just go away.&#148;

After casting one more look at her fallen opponent, Kasumi turned to 
walk away from her. She knew in her heart that by competing in a 
second Dead or Alive championship, she was essentially locking herself 
into combat with Ayane. But she had no choice. There was no way she 
could back down. She had to find Hayate at all costs. Just to know 
that her brother was safe. Even if it just meant learning that one 
fact, Kasumi would readily throw herself into battle. 

Ayane scowled as Kasumi walked away from her. &#147;Yeah, that&#146;s right you 
little coward! Walk away! That&#146;s what you&#146;re good for!&#148;

The brunette looked back with sad eyes. &#147;I didn&#146;t do anything wrong.&#148;

&#147;I bet you didn&#146;t!&#148; Ayane yelled sardonically. &#147;Why the hell do you 
even bother competing in this when you know we&#146;ll track you down?&#148;

Kasumi then looked away. &#147;Because... my brother... he...&#148;

Ayane&#146;s eyed went wide. Why the hell did she have the right to speak 
his name? Kasumi was the one who abandoned the clan; she was the one 
who shirked her duties as easily as water rolling off her back. This 
wasn&#146;t her problem anymore.

&#147;He isn&#146;t your brother anymore!&#148; Ayane yelled. &#147;You gave Hayate up a 
long time ago, Kasumi! You&#146;re nothing to the Mugen Tenshin now! So 
just runaway, shinobi.&#148;

Though it was a struggle, Kasumi held back her tears. She was a strong 
woman, and it would usually take a thousand sharp stabs by her Tanto 
for her to even to shed a tear, but Ayane&#146;s words hit her hard. She 
didn&#146;t want to abandon her friends and family that was just an 
unwanted consequence of her actions. Everyday she felt punished for 
her choices in life. Not a day went by where Kasumi regretted that 
decision. But she was not going to apologize or show remorse for it 
just because it bent Ayane in the wrong way. She had committed no 
crime.  

Kasumi&#146;s truth was accentuated through the passion and fire in those 
ginger-brown eyes of hers. &#147;I didn&#146;t run away because I wanted to.&#148; 
She started. &#147;I left the Mugen Tenshin because I had to protect 
Hayate&#146;s interests. Not because I wanted to leave him behind. I think 
a part of me also wanted to explore life outside of the clan. That is 
not a crime. It&#146;s my right as a woman, and nobody can take that away 
from me. Not even you. I won&#146;t justify myself to you, Ayane.&#148;

&#147;Because you can&#146;t!&#148; Ayane yelled. The snow was beginning to pick up 
again, just like it had done in their battle. &#147;Hayate isn&#146;t your 
concern anymore, none of this is! Just get yourself lost and never 
come back!&#148;

Kasumi&#146;s head jerked as she looked away. &#147;Do... do you really hate me 
that much...?&#148;

Ayane herself looked away. She did not want to answer that. Neither 
one of them wanted to know the answer to that question, chances are it 
would stir up something that didn&#146;t need to be re-awoken. Ayane&#146;s 
reprieve from those memories was granted as Kasumi&#146;s feet touched the 
white snow in an opposite direction. She was off to find Hayate. Find 
someone who she more or less discarded. And Ayane was left to wallow 
in the snow. Even though Kasumi was the one who ran away, Ayane was 
the one left alone. Always alone...

**********

Kasumi X stumbled aimlessly through the crowds and crowds of commuters 
and shoppers in this business district of Creutzwald. It had been 
almost 3 days since she escaped the Super-human Development Project. 
She was wearing a stealthy red ninja suit she found inside the 
complex, but she assumed that it would make her stand out from the 
crowd. Luckily she managed to find a cloak on her way into this town. 
Though she looked very suspicious, Kasumi X was actually aiming for 
the opposite. She was trying her hardest to seem less conspicuous, but 
still she received stare after stare from people as she walked. 

{I need to be off this street.) Kasumi X turned sharply to the left, 
walking into a very quiet alleyway. Luckily this alley was also the 
entrance into a small, under-city nightclub called the Dead Moon.  

Kasumi X thought about the pro and cons of entering the club. {Maybe I 
can stay here for a while until I figure out what to do.}

The clone walked over to the small flight of steps leading to the 
inside, and walked in. From the moment she stepped inside, she was hit 
by the rancid stink of smoke, alcohol and lost hopes. This bar itself 
was fairly spaced out; burly characters that were fruitlessly trying 
to drink their problems away surrounded each table. The climate of the 
place screamed risk, but these people did not concern Kasumi X. She 
had been on her feet for so long, K-2 just needed to rest herself for 
a while. 

The bright-eyed girl took a seat by a small table in the corner of the 
room, breathing a sigh of relief from finally sitting down. She wasn&#146;t 
going to attempt to blend in, that would be impossible, but she would 
try not to draw too much attention to herself. 

Soon, a waitress walked up to her from the other side of the bar. She 
had a notepad in her hand and her jaw was moving up and down, she was 
obviously chewing gum.   

&#147;What&#146;s your order?&#148; She asked.

Kasumi X looked up to see this woman. &#147;Huh?&#148;

The waitress rolled her eyes. &#147;Well, you wanna have a drink, right? 
Well what would you like?&#148;

The clone girl thought about that. From the way she was feeling right 
now, she got the impression that the original Kasumi was abhorred to 
alcohol. All the same, if she didn&#146;t buy something, she might get 
thrown out of here. 

&#147;Eh...&#148; Kasumi X stumbled around this. &#147;W-What would you... suggest?&#148; 

The waitress sighed. &#147;I guess I&#146;d have a Pina Colada or something. 
Would you like that, honey?&#148;

Kasumi X just nodded. After scribbling down the order, the waitress 
walked over to another table to get their order. Just as she settled 
down again, she realized that she really didn&#146;t have any money. She 
had literally nothing more than the clothes on her back. But she had 
more urgent things to worry about. Ever since she stepped through the 
doors to this bar, a table of men had had their eyes on her. 

She knew that she was an attractive woman; she was bound to get a few 
stares from people. But she didn&#146;t have to like it. Kasumi X wasn&#146;t 
going to leave either. She finally felt comfortable here; she did not 
want to leave yet. As the girl suspected, those three men stepped away 
from their table and came over to her. 

Kasumi X looked away. She really did not want to have to dislocate 
anyone&#146;s shoulder right now. 

One of the three men spoke up, his voice feigning a weak air of 
caring. &#147;Hey there, gorgeous. You on your own?&#148;

She nodded, still looking away from them. &#147;Y-Yes.&#148;

A second man took a seat next to Kasumi X. &#147;That&#146;s a shame. My buddies 
and me have a little place not too far from here. We could go there... 
it&#146;d be quieter than this place...&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; The brown-haired girl said. &#147;I think I like it here.&#148;

The third man had an annoyed look on his face. &#147;You should really take 
up the offer, girl.&#148;

Over by the bar side, Ayane was drowning her sorrows. The second Dead 
or Alive tournament ended three days ago, she had been removed during 
the semi-finals by that damn Kasumi. Ayane had been commissioned for 
an assassination here, somebody DOATEC obviously wanted out of the 
way. Normally she wouldn&#146;t have bothered (the way she was feeling) but 
she had never been to Germany before. Plus, the job paid well; there 
hadn&#146;t been such a well-paid job for her since her attempt on Helena&#146;s 
life. This time however, she would not fail. 

Ayane lifted up her shot glass ad quickly took it down. She was still 
underage to drink, but nobody here was questioning it. Seems like they 
just had their own problems to worry about. Just like Ayane. The 
Female Tengu tried hard to think out her next move, but a rowdy table 
was making noise.

She looked back to see what was going on. Some girl draped in a shabby 
cloak was being hassled by three men. Ayane gritted her teeth. 
Normally she really wouldn&#146;t have given a damn about that girl and 
what happened to her, but right now, she was in one sour mood. Getting 
herself involved would shut those guys up and it&#146;d give her a chance 
to stretch her muscles a bit. Before she knew it, Ayane was walking 
over there. 

Back at the table, those three abrasive men surrounded Kasumi X. She 
was trying *very* hard not to reveal her true strength, but if they 
did do something soon, she would have take them out. Suddenly a young 
woman appeared behind one of them. 

One of the bar hoppers spoke to Kasumi X. &#147;listen, kid. We can show 
you a real nice time if you play your cards right-&#147; 

His sentence was cut off when he felt someone tap on his shoulder. 
With an annoyed sigh, he looked back. &#147;What&#146;s the pro-&#147; 

Wham! A lightning-fast fist smashed into the face of that crude drunk, 
making the injured man cry out from the pain. One punch had probably 
just cracked his nose. 

The two other men surrounded Ayane, who had an awfully pleased smile 
on her face. Kasumi X just watched this with good attention. That was 
no ordinary punch. This woman had to be significant in some way. 

The previous guy was still screaming on the floor as his nose gushed 
blood, while the other two surrounded Ayane. 

&#147;For such a cute little girl, you&#146;ve sure got some balls on you.&#148; He 
said arrogantly. &#147;But I don&#146;t take kindly to sucker punching school 
girls. So you better just run along, honey.&#148;

Ayane smiled a little. &#147;Hmm. Interesting offer. And the survey said... 
screw you.&#148;

The body of the Woman Tengu kneeled down to the ground for balance, 
and before the drunkard above her knew what was going on, her leg 
smacked into his jaw with a powerful arc-like kick. He went sprawling 
over into the opposite direction, his feet stumbling over the ground.  
The hawkish eyes of the lilac-haired woman darted to the second guy, 
and her leg quickly span around the floor, sweeping him off his feet. 
But Ayane was not done yet. 

{One more for the road.} She thought as she stood up gracefully. 

As she stood, Ayane grabbed the drunkard bar hopper by the collar, 
pulled him onto his feet and held on a tight grip around his neck. She 
swung around his body by means of his neck, quickly stopping with both 
of her feet planted firmly on his back. She then pulled him downwards 
and rested her back on the ground, pressing both her legs upwards. The 
drunk was thrown clear across the room, eventually crashing into a bar 
table as gravity did it job. 

The whole bar fell silent at this brief but brutal display of power. 
The H. Embu really was not that impressive but it did take some skill 
to master. While the other customers gazed at Ayane with some awe, 
Kasumi X felt strangely about this girl. 

{Why does my heart beat faster when I see that girl?} She thought 
curiously. {Is she an important person to the original?}

Ayane scowled at the three downed bar hoppers and began to walk away. 
She did whip their consecutive cans, but truth be told it didn&#146;t make 
her feel any better. Beating around weaker opponents was surprisingly 
less fun than it sounded. Before she could get any further away, 
Kasumi X held onto the wrist of Ayane. &#147;Excuse me...&#148;

That voice sounded strangely familiar. Ayane looked back. Kasumi X 
still had that cloak over her body and her face was obscured by it. 
The lilac-haired fighter had no idea who this girl was, but she didn&#146;t 
much care either. 

&#147;What is it?&#148; Ayane asked dejectedly. 

Kasumi X was thankful that her blush was hidden. &#147;Thank you for...&#148;

Ayane looked away. &#147;Not a problem. But don&#146;t get too cheery. I didn&#146;t 
do that to save you.&#148;

The young clone fell silent. Ayane got the idea that she might have 
hurt the girl&#146;s feelings. Last thing she needed right now was a 
blubbering woman who couldn&#146;t defend herself.

&#147;Look...&#148; Ayane tried her best not to seem hostile. &#147;I&#146;m in a bad mood 
right now. I just needed to blow off some steam. So who are you 
anyway...?&#148;

Kasumi X was curious to see what would happen if she revealed her 
identity to this girl. There had to be some connection between that 
ninja and the original. Slowly, she unmasked herself to the world, 
pulling down her hood. Ayane&#146;s eyes went wide with shock, and then 
narrowed with anger. Anger at Kasumi but mostly at herself.

{I just rescued Kasumi&#146;s ass...} Ayane thought scathingly. {You better 
be enjoying this, Kami-sama, because I&#146;m not.}

Kasumi X was thrown by Ayane&#146;s sudden change in attitude. One moment 
she seemed so calm and relaxed, the next, she&#146;s ready to explode. All 
from learning her identity? Well, it confirmed that the original 
Kasumi knew who this kunoichi was. But there must have been some 
bitterness between them. 

{If the original doesn&#146;t like this girl... why am I so attracted to 
her?} The perfect replica was confused. Very much so. 

Ayane on the other hand, was very focused. She could just as easily 
start a fight between herself and Kasumi, right here. But she was in 
no mood to be dealing with the brown-haired girl right now. Ayane 
turned to walk away from a silent Kasumi (X) and strode over to the 
entrance to the bar. Just before she stepped out, Ayane looked back 
over her shoulder for an instance.

Her voice was astoundingly gentle. &#147;...Did you find Hayate?&#148;

Kasumi X had no idea what Ayane was talking about. Though that name 
raised a few sentiments within her. One of them was... security. That 
name &#145;Hayate&#146; gave her a striking feeling of love and protection. And 
those were the kind of emotions that you would get from family. But 
even deeper down, there was a feeling of... envy towards that name, 
Hayate. Envy on more than just one level. And somehow, Kasumi X knew 
that envy was connected to this lavender-haired kunoichi. When no 
response was offered, Ayane chuckled harshly at Kasumi (X)&#146;s silence. 

&#147;I didn&#146;t think so.&#148; Her voice had reverted from gentle back to 
mocking. Ayane then threw out one last comment as she left. &#147;You&#146;re 
worthless, Kasumi.&#148;

Kasumi X&#146;s gaze dropped to the floor. {Why did that hurt me? It wasn&#146;t 
all that insulting. Is it because it came from her? Is that why it 
hurts so much? I-I can&#146;t let her go now. I have to know why I&#146;m 
feeling this way.}

The young confused woman ran through the same double doors that Ayane 
went through, following her in her tracks. Out on the main road, Ayane 
walked along the busy pavement towards her apartment building. She was 
going to be stuck in Germany until she took care of that assassination 
job, so it suited Ayane&#146;s interests to rent out a place for now. She 
turned a corner and kept on walking for around fifteen minutes. 
Eventually she reached her apartment building in the residential area 
of this end of the town. The area was very quiet, a large water garden 
was in the middle of a large courtyard surrounded the apartment 
building. 

Ayane would have taken better interest in that quiet scene, if hadn&#146;t 
have heard footsteps behind her. The Woman Tengu turned around to see 
Kasumi (X) standing just a few metres away. Ayane was incredulous. 
This girl had actually followed her. Of all the...

&#147;You followed me here?&#148; She said darkly. &#147;Do you have some kind of 
mental problem? I thought I told you to stay the hell away from me?&#148;

Kasumi X tried hard not to let Ayane&#146;s anger hurt her. &#147;I just... 
wanted to be around you. That&#146;s all.&#148;

Now Ayane was *very* confused. Kasumi was acting very... strangely. 
Especially after how she was acting in the Dead or Alive tournament. 
It only struck Ayane now that Kasumi hadn&#146;t even bothered to defend 
herself against those bar thugs. However, Ayane just dismissed it as 
on of Kasumi&#146;s constant changes. It did not mean anything at all. 
Still, she couldn&#146;t ignore the kunoichi&#146;s last comment. 

&#145;I just... wanted to be around you. That&#146;s all.&#146;

Why would Kasumi say something like that, after...? Geh. Ayane tried 
hard not to even think about that. That happened a long time ago. No 
need to re-live it. 

&#147;I don&#146;t know what games you&#146;re playing...&#148; Ayane began. &#147;But I&#146;m 
warning you to get lost.&#148;

Kasumi X was strangely firm. &#147;I&#146;m not going anywhere.&#148;

By now, Ayane was actually angry. Instantly she turned around fully, 
and her feet began moving her over to an un-characteristically decided 
Kasumi. &#147;Now listen, you-&#147;

Ayane froze in her tracks and Kasumi X was strangely alert when she 
felt a twinge in her ankle. Ayane had felt it a little when she pulled 
off that H. Embu on that guy back at the bar, but it didn&#146;t start 
bothering her until now. Well, she had been walking for like fifteen 
minutes straight. Maybe that triggered off some damage. The young 
ninja dropped on to one knee, realizing that she could not balance on 
her legs alone. 

Kasumi X quickly went to her side, putting an arm around Ayane&#146;s 
shoulder. &#147;Are you okay? Can you stand?&#148;

Ayane cruelly jerked that arm off. &#147;Don&#146;t touch me! I can take care of 
myself. What do you care, anyways?&#148;

The emotion within Kasumi&#146;s clone changed from compassion to anger. 
&#147;Stop treating me like that! I&#146;m just trying to help you, Ayane.&#148;

The clone then froze. How did she know that the girl&#146;s name was Ayane? 
That confirmed it without a doubt. The original model had to have 
known this... &#145;Ayane&#146; character. 

&#147;Where&#146;s your apartment?&#148; Kasumi X asked. 

Ayane (who had decided to cool down a little) nodded over to the 
three-floor building to the left of them. Kasumi X kneeled down to 
Ayane at eye-level, smiling that generous smile of hers. A generous 
smile complimented by those golden brown eyes. Ayane looked away from 
that smile. She hated the idea that Kasumi&#146;s smile gave her feelings 
of safety. 

&#147;I can get you home.&#148; Said the clone. &#147;J-Just let me be near you for a

Kaiser&#146;s Afterthoughts
----------------------

* The first chapter of three. This will be a lemon in future chapters, 
so stay tuned for more. Oh, and I&#146;m aware that the clone of Kasumi is 
called Kasumi Alpha, but my DOA2 instruction book calls her &#145;Kasumi X&#146; 
so I&#146;m just rolling with it...

* If this goes well, I&#146;m gonna take a swing at a Lei-Fang/Helena 
one-shot. Of course, Jann Lee will be involved somehow...

* Any comments you might have? Just e-mail me! Thanks!</pre>
