<h1>The Big Sister</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../doa/index.html">Dead or Alive</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jam.html">Jam! Crime Fighting Cook!</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Ayane!!&quot; Kasumi had yelled from the top of her lungs angrily. &quot;I 
know your out here! Come out already!&quot; As the kunoichi weaved tree 
through tree, In the forest with a miffed frown on her face. The one 
she was calling for dropped from a branch, face to face, surprising the 
girl enough to stumble backwards.
	&quot;Quiet down already I hear you.&quot; Ayane had a rather superior 
smirk on her face, as if she was quite proud of something that she&#39;s 
done to her sister. Kasumi glared at the purpled haired girl infront of 
her as she flipped from the tree branch she was holding her self upside 
down on. &quot;You! I have a couple of questions for I need your &quot;help&quot; on&quot; 
Kasumi came face to face with her sister, locking her brown eyes onto 
red ones. &quot;I must ask sis...what is the whole meaning of this?&quot; Ayane 
coolly said, shrugging her shoulders innocently.
	&quot;Would you happen to know...&quot;Kasumi dug into a small satchel on 
the left side of her hip, pulling out a green lizard,dead,from the end 
of its tail. &quot;what this is doing in my bed when I woke up today?&quot; The 
taller girl frowned awaiting Ayane&#39;s confession as she tossed the 
reptile to the side. Instead she received, &quot;Oooh...so that&#39;s what that 
whole screaming thing was for this morning? Wouldn&#39;t of guessed.&quot; from 
her younger sister, still holding a dangerous smile on her lips. &quot;Oh by 
the way...is your friend Kei feeling any better since lunch?&quot; Ayane 
asked. Kasumi&#39;s  eyes began to burn. &quot;I think so...doesn&#39;t make sense 
that the school lunch would give her...&#39;sudden flatulence&#39;, and 
embarrassing her infront of the those kids in class today.&quot; Ayane 
giggled as her older sibling retold the story. &quot;Must of been something 
in her food?&quot;
	&quot;Correct.&quot; Kasumi had showed two white pills to the younger 
kunoichi. &quot;Laxatives...in YOUR backpack.&quot; Kasumi pointed out strongly. 
&quot;In MY backpack? What would I be doing with a box of laxatives? Is your 
&#39;little story&#39; going somewhere Kasumi?&quot; Ayane blew a strand of violet 
hair from her face, crossing her arms over her chest. &quot;Indeed it is 
LITTLE sister.&quot; Kasumi  started. &quot;You think you can just play pranks on 
me and act as if I wont know its you? How dumb do you think I am?&quot;
	&quot;Dumb enough to put on your bra even though it had itching powder 
I put in it yesterday?&quot; Ayane slyly confessed, her ego boosting from 
the blank look on her older sisters face. The taller kunoichi became 
estatic, &quot;That was you too!? I swear I&#39;ll make you pay for this!&quot; She 
threatened.  Ayane was enjoying watching her sister fume and 
disgruntled, looking up to her fiery brown eyes. &quot;Oh really?...So what 
are you gonna do about it?
	Kasumi didn&#39;t back down. &quot; You think you know all my tricks, do 
you? Well maybe I&#39;ll just add something special in your breakfast 
tomorrow, or better yet, in your shampoo?&quot; Ayane taunted Kasumi with a 
yawn, playing with the ends of her bandanna. &quot;Talk about 
beginners...&quot;she blurted. Kasumi scratched her chin with her thumb, 
like she was in thought. &quot;Well...about about I make you...&quot; She stopped 
half way with her own sneaky smile.
	Her sibling kunoichi&#39;s eyes came back to Kasumi. &quot;Don&#39;t even...&quot; 
Ayane said seriously.
	&quot;Ohhh...that&#39;s it, IM gonna make you &#39;say it&#39;.&quot; Kasumi whispered. 
She swore she could hear her younger sister gulp when she finished her 
sentence. &quot;T...there&#39;s no way your gonna make me say it again Kasumi!&quot; 
She backed from her sisters face and turned around, as Kasumi had a 
very sly and catty grin. &quot;Not no way...no how!&quot; &quot;Kasumi cracked the 
knuckles in her right hand as she cocked her head to the side, letting 
her braid swing behind her shoulder. &quot;Sorry sis I didn&#39;t catch all 
that&quot;
	&quot;I said! Not no way not no h-&quot;
	*Pow!*
	The light in Ayane&#39;s red eyes turned dim and her world went dark 
lifelessly slumping onto her knees and falling backwards onto Kasumi&#39;s 
knees. Just one strike to the neck would it take, somewhat a specialty 
from the brown haired ninja&#39;s brother, Hayate. Kasumi laughed lightly, 
hoisting her little sister up from her arms and dragging her back where 
she came entered the forest from.
	Minutes...maybe an hour? Her head was still woozy from the 
attacked that knocked her out. She felt...restrained, and she wasn&#39;t on 
the rough floor of the forest, but something softer.
	&quot;Sleepy head...wake up sleepy head.&quot; That chant. she immediately 
disliked it, It sounded like it came from her sister. Ayane&#39;s eyes 
cracked open slightly, with a shake of her head she regained her focus. 
She was now staring straight up into a ceiling, &#39;her&#39; ceiling, in &#39;her&#39; 
room!
	&quot;About time...I was thinking I hit you too hard back there.&quot; 
Kasumi said, giggling. &quot;Wh-what the? You cheater! You hit me from 
behind!&quot; Ayane wanted to reach out and grab her sister by the neck, but 
she realized that her arms were tied back as well her ankles, the 
texture was definitly silk rope, but it was tied on rather tight. &quot;Now 
now little sister, you LET your self get knocked out so easily. The 
kunoichi walked around the side of the bed, kneeling over to Ayane&#39;s 
face as she smiled. &quot;Oh by the way, how did I do on tying up your 
wrists and ankles? Pretty tight?&quot; The younger ninja was just waiting 
for her sisters face to get closer, so she could bite her right in the 
nose. &quot;I could of done it better.&quot; she answered with a sneer. &quot;Oh how 
mean.&quot; Kasumi fake pouted, sliding her hand over Ayane&#39;s forehead to 
sweep back the strands of hair. &quot;You have nobody to blame but your self 
sister, and now IM gonna make you &#39;say it&#39;.
	&quot;Ha! You&#39;ll never make me say it! Were trained to take any kind 
of torture&quot; Ayane pointed out matter-of-factly, clawing to get any type 
of upperhand in her situation. &quot;That is true, but you will say what I 
want to hear.&quot; Kasumi was pratictly laying her head aside from her 
sisters. Adding that the busty kunoichi sat up and crackled her fingers 
again, wiggling them. &quot;Shall we begin?&quot;
	Ayane mentally scoffed at her sister. &quot;She dosen&#39;t have what it 
takes to make me talk. Its all just a mind game, what is she going 
to....huh?&quot; She stopped her thought as  her sisters index finger had 
lightly touched the violet haired girls chin, and slowly went downward. 
Ayane blushed and had a confused look on her face. &quot;W-what are you 
doing?&quot; Kasumi had a very sneaky grin on her cute face, absolutely 
enjoying her power over her little sister. &quot;All you had to do is say it 
and I&#39;ll stop.&quot; Ayane frowned, she wouldn&#39;t let her, her PRIDE wouldn&#39;t 
let her utter those words. &quot;Forget it!&quot;
	&quot;Suit yourself then.&quot; Kasumi teased, her finger had kept its 
pursuit south, making stops now and again on Ayane&#39;s bare skin, 
smoothly rubbing the tanned flesh. Kasumi balanced her head in her 
other palm, watching Ayane&#39;s face turn more red around the cheeks. 
Kasumi had soon reached the cleavage of her sisters chest, making a 
brisk slide right on the curse, her smile becoming bigger as she heard 
the younger kunoichi&#39;s gasp. &quot;hee hee...were not there yet.&quot; The older 
girl stood up, hopping onto the bed and over Ayane, then sat on top of 
her. crashing like a ton of bricks. &quot;Ack hey!!&quot; Ayane gasped, her 
crimson eyes gazed at Kasumi, coughing a bit. &quot;And now you know how it 
feels to be sat on don&#39;t you?&quot; the kunoichi turned her head and stuck 
out her tongue, then returning her finger onto Ayane&#39;s thigh. her 
&quot;torture&quot; continued, slowly down the very toned leg, reaching one of 
its stops, the stocking on the left leg. Kasumi hummed quietly, but 
loud enough for her sister to hear, as she rolled back the purple 
fabric with both hands, exposing it, then the matching one on the 
right. She lifted the last one up, running her palm under the leg and 
the back of the knee lightly, grinning dangerously once more.
	Ayane was just perplexed. She knew her older sister was getting 
at something, but this whole massage was odd. It was very interesting 
though as she held back a giggle, as it was beginning to...to... &quot;AH! 
You wouldn&#39;t!!!&quot; She yelled out suddenly. &quot;Ooooh, so now you figured it 
out have you?&quot; Kasumi seductively whispered, as she was beginning to 
unlace the boots Ayane adorned, throwing them off her small feet. Ayane 
curled them uncomfortably, But Kasumi wouldn&#39;t have any of that. &quot;Cmon 
show me those pretty feet yours please little sis?&quot; The brown haired 
girl had gotten a hold of one, taking off the stocking completely. &quot;I 
know you sister...and I know for a fact.&quot; she paused, pinching the 
littlest toe of Ayane lightly.
	Ayane gulped. this was certainly the end.
	&quot;That your...TICKLISH!!&quot; The eldest sister declared as she let 
her fingers crawl aggressively over the heel of Ayane&#39;s feet and back 
down, simply enjoying her little sister bucking and sprawling under her 
weight. &quot;Coochie coochie coo lil&#39; sis!&quot;
	&quot;Oh no! No please Kasumi don&#39;t do..haahaa...THIS!...hee hee!&quot; 
Ayane had bit her lip, repressing from laughing out more pleas. Her 
sister remained merciless though, tickling the back of her knee and 
down back to her legs quickly. &quot;Put itching powder in my bra huh? Try 
to feed me laxatives will you!?&quot; Kasumi emitted a superior laugh, 
turning around and getting her fingers under Ayane&#39;s armpits and 
gliding the tips of her fingers in the sensitive spot. Ayane buckled 
wildly, strains of laughter coming from within her. &quot;Now say it!&quot; 
Kasumi ordered. &quot;Say it or I&#39;ll turn you more red then your already 
are!&quot; &quot;haa...haa...NEVER!&quot; She squealed. The jolts and spasms started 
to overtake the lithe frame of the girl under Kasumi, and with a few 
more bucks she squeezed under Kasumi&#39;s weight and fell to the floor, a 
twisted look of pain and laughter falling into a blanket with the rest 
of her. 
	&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!&quot; The brown haired kunoichi rolled off the bet 
and landed back onto the rear end of her little sister and continued to 
attack Ayane&#39;s toes and feet again. &quot;Saaay iiiit.&quot; her words lingered 
on. Ayane just couldn&#39;t hang on any more. her shut eyes began to tear, 
she couldn&#39;t hold her laughter any longer. Forget her pride, she wanted 
out of this!
	&quot;ALRIGHT...ALRIGHT! B-BIG SISTER! YOU WIN *haa* BIG SISTER 
KASUMI!*hee* NOW LET ME GO!&quot;
	&quot;You mean it? I really win? your not making it up are you?&quot; 
Kasumi playfully asked continued to tickle her little sister senseless.
	&quot;HONEST...HONEST!&quot; Ayane choked out, squirming around very 
uncomfortably. She couldn&#39;t show her big sister her submissive face. 
Kasumi ceased finally, her crafty smile calming down to a content glee. 
&quot;Now that wasn&#39;t to hard now was it &#39;Little sis&#39;?&quot; as she untied the 
ankle ropes. Ayane sighed in relief &quot;No big sister&quot;.&quot; she answered. The 
brown haired kunoichi slid off of the purple haired one and sat her 
upright, placing her sweaty sibling on her lap. Ayane didnt have the 
pissed off look one would thought she would be wearing, but a smile, 
she knew she was beaten, and the purple haired girl wouldn&#39;t want to be 
beaten by anyone else but her sister. The tired younger ninja girl 
placed her head onto her older sisters shoulder, nuzzling her cheek to 
cheek and purred. Kasumi smiled and untied the ropes on Ayane&#39;s wrists. 
&quot;You...haven&#39;t called me big sister for a long time. I really like when 
you call me that.&quot; She whispered, not wanting to startle the girl 
sitting on her.
	&quot;I...I&#39;ll promise to call you that more, big sister Kasumi.&quot; 
Ayane voice had turned sweeter as she dozed off.
	&quot;Thank you, little sis.&quot; Kasumi pecked a small kiss on Ayane&#39;s 
cheek, finishing unknotting the rope, holding her around the waist. 
Ayane wrapped her hands around the taller girls neck, cuddling her body 
to Kasumi&#39;s. &quot;Love you...&quot;
