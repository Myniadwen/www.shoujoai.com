<h1>The Truth</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../doa/index.html">Dead or Alive</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/linkhesave.html">LinkeHeSaveZelda</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	Tina stepped off the boat and dropped her luggage.  She inhaled 
and smelled the fresh air.  &quot;Aaah...&quot; she exhaled.  Tina picked up her 
luggage and started to walk away when she heard a familiar voice.
	&quot;Tina!&quot;
	Tina looked and saw her old friend, Lisa.  Lisa was laying on a 
beach towel.  &quot;Lisa!&quot;  She signaled for Tina to come over.  Tina dropped 
her luggage again and ran to where Lisa was laying.  &quot;Long time no see,&quot; 
she said.
	Lisa took off her sunglasses and looked up at Tina.  &quot;So, what are 
you here for?&quot;
	&quot;What am I here for?  For the tournament, of course.&quot;
	Lisa chuckled.  &quot;There isn&#39;t a tournament here.&quot;
	&quot;What?&quot;
	&quot;There isn&#39;t going to be a tournament here.  That bastard Zack 
lied.&quot;
	Tina frowned.  &quot;Where is he?  Where is that lying frog?&quot;
	&quot;Relax, Tina.  Enjoy yourself while you&#39;re here.  They&#39;re going to 
hold volleyball tournaments.&quot;  Tina frowned down at Lisa.  &quot;You can win 
money.  Lot&#39;s of money.&quot;
	Tina thought about it, but decided against staying.  &quot;Sorry, Lisa, 
but I&#39;m not gonna let some perv whack off watching me play volleyball in 
a bathing suit.&quot;
	Lisa stood up.  She grabbed Tina&#39;s arms and shook her.  &quot;Come on, 
Tina.  It&#39;ll be fun!  As I said, you can win money!  Please, stay?&quot;  
Lisa put the puppy dog look on her face.
	Tina smiled and laughed.  &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll stay.  But only because you 
want me to.&quot;
	Lisa jumped.  &quot;Great!  Let me show you around the island!&quot;
	&quot;Lead the way.&quot;  They started walking away when Tina realized she 
forgot her luggage.  &quot;Whoops, forgot luggage.  Be right back!&quot;  Tina ran 
to where her luggage was and picked it up.  Lisa stared at her.  Tina... 
my Tina..., she thought.

*	*	*

	Lisa led Tina into a store.  &quot;This is the sporting goods store.  
They sell anything that you need.  Swimsuits, volleyballs, sunglasses, 
you name it.&quot;  Tina walked up to a rack of bathing suits and checked 
them out.  Lisa continued to look at her friend as she walked around the 
store.  She couldn&#39;t help but let her eyes wander over Tina&#39;s body.  Her 
beauty, her muscles, her grace.  I need to let her know how I feel about 
her, Lisa thought.  But when?  How?  
	&quot;Lisa, helloooo.  LISA!&quot;  Tina snapped her fingers in front of 
Lisa&#39;s face.  Lisa jumped.
	&quot;What?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m going to try this swimsuit on, okay?&quot;
	Lisa nodded her head.  &quot;Yeah, sure, go ahead.&quot;  She watched Tina 
go into a dressing room with the bathing suit.  She waited, and about 
five minutes later, Tina came out wearing the bathing suit.  She walked 
over to Lisa.
	&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; Tina asked.  She turned around once, her 
arms out at a horizontal angle.  Lisa stared at Tina.
	&quot;It&#39;s gorgeous,&quot; she said.
	&quot;So, do you think I should buy it?&quot;
	Lisa stared at her, her mouth open.  She nodded her head.  
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;
	&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll be right back again.&quot;  Lisa watched the blond wrestler 
walk up to the cash register.  The bottom part was a thong, and she 
couldn&#39;t help but stare at Tina&#39;s firm butt.  Lisa quickly looked away, 
pondering when and how she was going to tell Tina the truth.

*	*	*

	&quot;Lisa, when are the first volleyball matches?&quot; Tina asked
	&quot;Oh, in about ten minutes,&quot; Lisa replied.  &quot;So, you&#39;re going to 
play, then?&quot;
	Tina nodded.  &quot;Yeah, I changed my mind.  It could be fun.&quot;
	&quot;Could be.  Let&#39;s go now, to prepare, okay?&quot;
	&quot;Sure.  Where to?&quot;
	&quot;This private beach that&#39;s through these woods.&quot;
	&quot;All right, let&#39;s go.&quot;  Tina started off for the woods, Lisa right 
behind.  
	Now is the time, Lisa.  When they surfaced at the private beach, 
no one was there.
	Tina looked over at Lisa.  &quot;Lisa, did you take us to the wrong 
location?&quot;
	Lisa looked down at the ground.  It&#39;s now or never.  &quot;Yes, I did.  
And on purpose, too.&quot;
	Tina looked confused.  &quot;Why?&quot;
	Lisa looked up at Tina.  &quot;There&#39;s something I have to tell you, 
Tina.  Something I&#39;ve been meaning to say to you for a long time.&quot;
	&quot;What&#39;s going on, Lisa?&quot;
	Lisa put her hand on the back of Tina&#39;s head.  &quot;I love you, Tina.&quot;  
She gently kissed Tina on the lips.  Tina pushed her away.
	&quot;What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing!?&quot; Tina yelled.
	Lisa stared Tina in the eyes.  &quot;Tina, don&#39;t.  Please.  I love you.  
I&#39;ve been meaning to tell you for a long time.&quot;  Tina just glared back 
at Lisa.  She turned around and ran back into the woods.  &quot;Tina!&quot; she 
called after her.  &quot;Tina!&quot;  Lisa walked up to a tree and slumped to the 
ground, her back against it.  She started to cry.

*	*	*

	Lisa got back to her hotel room.  It was 1:00 in the morning.  She 
had stayed out at the private beach, thinking.  Thinking about what she 
would do now, now that the one she truly loved hated her.  Lisa unlocked 
the door and stepped inside.  She turned the lights on.  There, sitting 
on her bed, was Tina.
	&quot;What do you want?&quot; Lisa asked Tina.
	&quot;I wanted to apologize,&quot; she answered.  &quot;That was very rude what I 
did.  It&#39;s just that... I never thought I&#39;d say this, but...&quot;
	Lisa&#39;s heart started racing.  &quot;But what?&quot;
	Tina stood up and walked over to Lisa.  She shut the door then 
kissed her.  Lisa&#39;s eyes were wide, she didn&#39;t know what was happening.  
Tina broke the kiss.  &quot;I love you too, Lisa.&quot;
	Tina and Lisa embraced each other.  They stood there, holding each 
other for a long time.
