<h1>Bondage, Yuri and Ninja Schoolgirls (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../doa/index.html">Dead or Alive</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hexelf.html">Hex Elf</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Make up your mind!&quot; The Yakuza hit man chanted. &quot;Will you give us what 
we want?&quot; 

In the back room of a smoky bar, that&#39;s where it would be. 

&quot;Never! And besides, you would never get there!&quot; 

Looks more like some sort of warehouse. Who was that girl anyway? 

&quot;That&#39;s not what I wanted to hear.&quot; The well-dressed mob character 
adjusted his Armani costume while cracking his fist. &quot;And that won&#39;t 
help you one bit.&quot; 

How many is in here? The girl, no problem of course, being tied to a 
chair and all, the obvious prime target Yakuza hit man and his partner 
being out of the room at the moment. Is there someone hidden in that 
dark corner behind her? 

&quot;You know who we got here in the back? I bet you&#39;re dying to know. 
Asking yourself, &#39;Is it him? Did they find him? Did the cellar serve as 
a...&quot; He started whispering, &quot;...good hideout?&quot; 

&quot;No, not...&quot; 

&quot;Kyosuke?&quot; The hit man said interrupting her. &quot;Fine lad, but he&#39;d never 
win the one hundred meters in Sidney.&quot; 

What are they talking about? Who is this Kyosuke? The corner seems to be 
clear, but on the other hand, Yakuza hit men never stay alone. 

&quot;You bastards! You bastards! Let Kyosuke go! I swear, you&#39;ll be sorry.&quot; 

Brilliant, he is using stealth, too bad he forgot to shower off that 
stinky smell. 

&quot;Warren, bring in the kid!&quot; 

The door opened there was another much larger member of the same Yakuza 
triad. He was wearing the same suit as his cooperate but in gray instead 
of black. He brought a distinct smell of smoke with him. With him was a 
young man, obviously Kyosuke, with blonde hair and sports clothes, he 
was struggling like crazy but seemed to have little to say to the man 
beside him. As the door closed there was a slight moan, too quiet 
however to be heard by an untrained ear. 

&quot;Kyosuke! Are you okay! Please say that they didn&#39;t hurt you!&quot; 

That was easy enough. Now let&#39;s see about that ape over there. The new 
obvious prime target due to hostage held. 

&quot;Mina, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Kyosuke moaned, it was obvious that he was crying, 
however he hid it well in the shadows of the dark room. As he did 
however the young man thought he could see one of the shadows moving at 
blinding speed beside him. 

&quot;No, don&#39;t be, it&#39;s not your fault.&quot; Mina, the girl tied to the chair, 
answered softly. 

&quot;Now that family reunion is over let me make it easy for you.&quot; The 
smaller hit man in black said and pulled out a large gun from inside his 
suit. &quot;Tell us and he lives, refuse and he dies.&quot; 

&quot;To hell with you!&quot; Mina began, however as the gun was pointed towards 
Kyosuke. &quot;No wait, wait, please don&#39;t hurt him...I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll tell you-&quot; 

&quot;Ah, finally we agree...&quot; 

&quot;Umm...boss...&quot; The larger hit man suddenly moaned.

&quot;Yes what is it now?&quot; The armed one asked with an angry voice and turned 
around only to face his partner covered in blood. &quot;What the...???&quot; 

Excellent, he turned around. 

&quot;Who in the name of-urrrrgh!&quot; The man gasped as his chest suddenly burst 
open being penetrated by some kind of cheap looking blade. 

&quot;Don&#39;t ask, die,&quot; a soft voice said from behind him. 

&quot;W-What&#39;s happening, who are you??&quot; Mina cried looking around 
desperately trying to make out what was going on. 

A masked woman turned to face the girl with eyes cold as ice. She dried 
of her sword and sheeted it. &quot;You&#39;re the one called Mina right?&quot; The 
female assassin asked.

&quot;Y-Y-Yes b-but-&quot; 

&quot;Good,&quot; she said and grabbed the girl&#39;s chin. The kunoichi turned Mina&#39;s 
face from side to side while her eyes looking like she just wanted to 
get away from the room as soon as possible. 

&quot;Hey what are you...&quot; 

&quot;Be quiet if you know what&#39;s good for you.&quot; The assassin said while 
forcefully sticking her fingers inside Mina&#39;s mouth and looking inside. 

&quot;Aggg...ahhhrr...oooooging...&quot; Mina moaned while struggling but being 
hopelessly held back by the ropes around her wrists. She then felt cold 
metal against her throat and stopped. 

&quot;I guess it&#39;s true what they say,&quot; the trained killer said while 
sticking her hand into Mina&#39;s dress and inside her bra causing the girl 
to moan loudly. &quot;...about women having more hiding places.&quot; Her hand 
returned holding a small roll of paper. She looked at it without facing 
away from the girl. 

&quot;I guess it&#39;s good enough.&quot; She said and made a quick move where she 
closed her hand, latched the arm out and opened the hand again, the roll 
of paper being gone. 

&quot;No! That&#39;s...mhmhmmmmhmh!!!&quot; Mina tried crying before the kunoichi 
pressed her Gatana harder against her throat causing a small stream of 
blood sipping out. 

&quot;What&#39;s the matter? You&#39;re alive and well, so is your little brother, be 
happy.&quot; The kunoichi looked at her small sword and loosened the grip a 
little. &quot;We won&#39;t meet again.&quot; 

The kunoichi seemed to jump but disappeared long before she landed again 
in a stream of smoke. 

&quot;Wait! You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re into!&quot; But it was too late. Mina could 
hear her brother moaning slightly. &quot;Get me out of here!&quot; She screamed. 



&quot;I brought back the scroll.&quot; Kasumi said while bowing in front of Raiga, 
an old man with lots of money. His house was considered a monument of 
the feudal Japan and it was richly filled with the most rare things from 
that period of time. She cared little about this however. 

&quot;I see the Fuuma ninja has once again lived up to its reputation.&quot; He 
said. &quot;Give me the scrolls and you will receive your reward.&quot; It was 
obvious that he got excited whenever he looked upon the female ninja&#39;s 
dreamlike figure. She was only here for the money though. 

Kasumi did as she was told and once again then small roll of paper was 
in her hand as she gave it to the elder man in front of her. The reward 
was not important to her; she only did what her clan told her to. The 
old man had hired her clan, and her master chose her as the mission 
executive, it was as simple as that. She looked at the man coldly as he 
got all excited and started babbling about a lost treasure. 

A woman dressed in a red Chinese dress cut high up the sides excused 
herself. Kasumi looked at her with suspicious eyes and noticed a small 
bag carried by the girl. 

&quot;Oh jolly, oh...&quot; Raiga said between his babbling. &quot;Ah yes that is your 
reward. We&#39;ll see you soon&#39; oh yeah, hahaha, well you want to stay 
that&#39;s fine with m...&quot; 

&quot;Out of the question, I return to my clan.&quot; Kasumi grabbed the bag of 
money and forced the servant girl out of the way by walking straight at 
her. 

She was gone.

***

&quot;WHAT???&quot; Ryu almost screamed. &quot;You chose HER in front of ME!&quot; 

He was sitting in front of the ninja master and arguing about his next 
mission. 

&quot;Yes, we have reason to believe that she is better fit for this mission 
than you are, please understand.&quot; The master seemed troubled by the 
questioning but he also respected Hayabusa&#39;s judgment. He was, after 
all, the most gifted ninja in known history, however he was just that, a 
mere ninja. 

&quot;You want Kasumi to go on a suicide mission that I could have done with 
my hands tied to my feet??? You have any idea how powerful a single 
Bakemonryu is?&quot; Ryu had dealt with the ghostly and sometimes purely 
devilish Bakemonryu several times before, Kasumi however, hadn&#39;t. 

&quot;I am well aware of that, but I say she is ideal for this mission.&quot; 

&quot;But...&quot; 

&quot;I have another mission for you!&quot; The ninja master was about to reach 
for a map inside his kimono when Kasumi walked in. 

&quot;I vow to serve and obey the Fuuma ninja clan.&quot; She said while bowing in 
front of them. 

&quot;We&#39;ll talk about it later. Ryu, please leave.&quot; Ryu too bowed and left 
the room knowing that it was no use in arguing once he got a mission of 
his own. 

&quot;Arise Kasumi.&quot; The ninja master said. Kasumi grabbed the handle of her 
sword and looked around in tradition to recognize assassins hidden in 
the room. Before she was done however the master ordered her to sit down 
in front of him. She reluctantly obeyed and sheeted her sword completely 
again. 

&quot;The Bakemonryu, known for being hired by Yakuza organizations, is in 
charge of transporting Kai, head of the Jinrai family. Because someone 
in the police seems to have failed in going to trial at the last attempt 
to put him away, we were hired to make the work short with Kai. We now 
know that you succeeded in your last mission against the triad and 
Bakemonryu, therefore you will get this mission as well. Don&#39;t 
disappoint me. This document contains the information you need.&quot; 

Kasumi did not know that the ninja that she had just killed on her last 
mission was of the Bakemonryu clan. He had been trained well in stealth 
techniques but the distinct smell, which she now knew was the Bakemonryu 
serum, (an oil used by the Bakemonryu clan to make their bodies appear 
somewhat transparent and ghostlike) had revealed his place. Never 
knowing what was coming she had cut his throat in the instant that the 
door was closed. 

She received a scroll and was ordered to leave. 

***

I see...The Fuuma ninja plans to assassinate the head of the Jinrai 
family. The master will be pleased...

*** 

&quot;Why do I get this job? They want me to infiltrate a computer company? A 
damn office building?&quot; Ryu quickly burned the document and got his white 
dragon sword. &quot;Well, it&#39;s no use in arguing. They want computer 
documents they&#39;ll get computer documents, if they want people dead, they 
GET people dead, if they want a frigging chicken leg I&#39;ll get them a 
chicken leg. Who hired us for this job anyway? No signature nor address, 
that&#39;s unusual.&quot; 

***

I must get to the master and tell...Just a second more and I will be 
out...

***

&quot;Nothing more to do at the moment. I should be waiting until darkness. I 
won&#39;t be going until after Kasumi is off anyway. I wonder how she will 
do against the Bakemonryu clan...they are vicious creeps, all of them. 
But once you can see through their ghastly appearance they break so 
easily.&quot; Ryu thought and sighed. 

&quot;Unless they are seriously well trained that is. I don&#39;t want to meet a 
master of their kind, I barely escaped with my life last time (See: 
Ninja Gaiden 2, last boss). But I&#39;d at least have a better chance of 
survival than an inexperienced newbie. Well, that&#39;s a little over-saying 
it, but battling is learning, and she just got lucky on with her first 
one. I really hope the master is right about this.&quot; Ryu looked up the 
roof from his bed and sighed. &quot;Well anyway, we&#39;re professionals, neither 
of us would be here if we weren&#39;t the top knot of the gang.&quot; 

***

There...now run, run, run...run like the wind...

***

&quot;I guess the best set around here would be a group of at least five...&quot; 
Kasumi was hidden up a tree studying the plans of her mission. Details 
meant everything, dishonor by cheating wasn&#39;t in her vocabulary and the 
faster and more easy the better. If she could do the entire mission 
without killing anyone except her target that was fine, but if blowing 
up the entire building was easier and faster then that was the way to 
go. However her employer had forbidden it and it was too short on time 
to get any C4. 

&quot;What about this way? They would naturally have guards at the main 
entrance, at least two outside the room and one inside. Whether these 
are ninjas or not needs to be checked out. There has to be at least one 
of them close to the target or else there&#39;s no point in their mission. 
Hmmm...&quot; 

Kasumi thought about it for a while. She felt she had to take Kai out 
while still in the hotel. He wouldn&#39;t be able to elude her very easily 
in there and as they were to transport him to an unknown place at the 
same night she might loose him if she messed up. 

&quot;I need plenty of kunai&#39;s, ropes and my sword.&quot; 

Kasumi studied the map some more and noticed a slight marking. 

&quot;Ryu? You sneaky little...&quot; Kasumi pulled out some powder from a pouch 
and put it on the paper. Red markings appeared on the map showing an old 
rebuilt water pipe going directly under the hotel. Obviously it wasn&#39;t 
on the newer blueprint and so the Bakemonryu might not expect it. 
Especially since it wasn&#39;t even on her own map in the first place.&quot; 

***

&quot;The Fuuma ninja you say? Well, it is to be expected. Those morons still 
does job for the low paying blue force (the police) eh? Well I&#39;ll send 
them something special...Now leave, your reward is to be presented to 
you in a few minutes.&quot; 

***
Night time 

Ryu watched as Kasumi left for the opposite direction than him. &quot;Good 
luck my friend.&quot; He thought as he left. His mission included a bit of 
timing. Obviously the documents were to be in place at a certain time, 
being 11:00 PM. He had done this kind of thing before and it sounded 
like a piece of cake. At least if he was alone on the mission. 

About an hour later he reached the building, still only 10:10 PM. Kasumi 
should be there about now. And she&#39;d get all the fun, which he wanted 
anyway. 

&quot;And here I am trying to earn my living by doing kiddie 
jobs...pathetic...&quot; The thoughtful ninja was professional but sometimes 
questioning and not used to be ordered around as he used to be a 
freelance. This paid well but sometimes it lacked&#39; adventure. He 
remembered back in the day when he got to fights thugs for free and life 
was nothing more than a cheap thrill after killing someone. 

&quot;Man, I don&#39;t see how I manage without people trying to kill me every 
day.&quot; 

***

&quot;The Hotel is directly above here.&quot; Kasumi put her Gatana to her mouth 
and climbed up a hole that led to a sewer below the hotel&#39;s cellar. 

&quot;They&#39;ll certainly expect me to get through here but not from this 
direction.&quot; Kasumi thought and tensed as she noticed several treads 
around her. Each connected to small explosive devices. &quot;Well, they won&#39;t 
let amateurs through that&#39;s for sure. Luckily the water in this section 
is turned off due to the reconstruction.&quot; 

Kasumi proceeded as planned and eluded the traps inside the tunnel. She 
continued towards the direction that would most likely have guards 
covering another tunnel. Hopefully they didn&#39;t know about this entrance 
and ignore anyone coming from this direction and instead concentrate on 
the other tunnels. 

&quot;Anything up there?&quot; 

&quot;No ma&#39;am.&quot; 

&quot;Keep looking, she&#39;ll most likely come through here somewhere.&quot; 

Two guards, naturally, guarding the entrance of the crossed tunnels. The 
tunnel Kasumi was in led straight through another one that was larger 
and also had water running through it. She lay down and climbed up the 
edge of the tunnel and looked down. Below her she could hear the guards 
talking. 

&quot;What about those tunnels, will we need to get up there?&quot; Said a guard 
coming down the tunnel. 

&quot;Nah, one doesn&#39;t lead anywhere and the only way into the other is 
either from the inside of the building or from this tunnel. We&#39;ll just 
have to make sure that no one tries to escape from up there or get in 
from down here.&quot; The other one answered. &quot;And you, watch those damn 
wires, one trip and we&#39;ll be singing with angels in no time. Just keep 
in the middle and you should be okay.&quot; 

&quot;S-Sure...&quot; 

Kasumi had placed a kunai&#39;s between each of her fingers. As soon as the 
first guard was in his way to the next point of guarding, or even turned 
around for a second his partner would wish that he&#39;d never been assigned 
to this place. 

&quot;What was that?&quot; The first guarding suddenly asked and turned around. 

Kasumi lifted her hand.

&quot;My radio, hold on it&#39;s probably those Bakemonryu seeing if we are doing 
what they said.&quot; 

She put it back quickly.

&quot;Yes, yes I know...No we haven&#39;t...Yes I told him...yeah...uh huh...and 
her too? I see...Guard ground 12 over and out.&quot; 

***

&quot;45 more minutes...They should be dropping off the documents soon...&quot; 
Ryu looked down an air duct just outside the door. From there he could 
easily climb down at any side of the wall that sealed the room off from 
the corridor. &quot;What do we have here?&quot; 

Two men walked under him and one talked into a radio. 

&quot;Yes, everything is clear. Of course...They wouldn&#39;t find the place with 
pure luck...I understand...Yes...We&#39;ll be waiting here until you 
arrive...Signing off.&quot; 

Hayabusa put down one knee to the metal and put his hand to his sword&#39;s 
shaft. Two of them? At least Ryu knew that he was not going to be bored 
for the next 44 minutes. Stealth games of death was his hobby. 

***

&quot;Damn I have to get over. And I don&#39;t know when and how often these guys 
have to report. It seems it&#39;s very irregular...&quot; Kasumi looked into the 
other tunnel. &quot;Maybe...&quot; 

She waited for a few more minutes. She stood up but with her hands to 
the ground. As soon as the first spark of the radio came she had about 
two seconds before the guard would answer and leave another sparking 
sound. 

Seconds passed, minutes passed. The other guard came back&#39; talked a 
little and was on his way again...One sound and she had to be on her way 
towards the other tunnel. 

*crackle*

&quot;NOW!&quot; With a gracious movement she was hurled into the air and with 
timing of a digital watch she landed just as the radio went on again. 

*crackle*

&quot;This is Guard Ground 12...No...Yes I am sure...&quot; 

Kasumi hurried down the tunnel. She had to make her way up quickly as 
the time was running short. Kasumi reached the basement elevator however 
it was guarded by a female Bakemonryu kunoichi, the scent of the serum 
reaching nothing much but Kasumi&#39;s well developed sense of smell. 

Since it was another, probably well-trained ninja, it would be very 
dangerous trying to sneak up on and kill her. And Kasumi couldn&#39;t use 
her body as distractions to get past this guard either. Often she had 
use of her, according to others, truly goddess like body in situations 
where she could not sneak up on her opponent. It was because pure 
sexuality could be used as one of the most deadly weapons. However it 
was only a slight 10% chance that it would work this time. And since it 
was another kunoichi she would most likely not be fooled by anything. 
Besides, Kasumi wasn&#39;t really into that thing anyway. 

Kasumi proceed through the tunnel and into the large shaft where the 
elevator was held. She looked around and found little space hide 
between. It was some kind of storage room, however all the boxes where 
moved down to the entrance of the tunnel providing free sight for the 
guard along most of the area. 

The Bakemonryu kunoichi coughed slightly and unsheathed her sword. She 
had found out already? This one was good. Kasumi looked around and found 
a large steel box. Above it large pipes were assembled, being only a 
storage room the department of this building obviously, like anyone else 
would, ignored putting an extra ceiling in for good looks. At some 
places high up the walls the air conditioning wasn&#39;t even covered up. 

&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Said the other kunoichi as she turned around quickly in a 
360-degree manner and then proceeded. 

Kasumi gathered a supply of throat needles and her previously equipped 
kunai&#39;s appeared in her hand like she was opening a fan. 

&quot;Oh...&quot; The kunoichi said to herself as she watched a rat run past her. 
&quot;Oh well...&quot; She reached for her sword and lashed at the rat however she 
failed miserably to connect. It looked pretty funny as she chased the 
rat around but it was also very dangerous to our beloved Kasumi as the 
other kunoichi might stumble into her by accident. 

Kasumi tensed and waited for a clear shot, one attack had to be fatal or 
it would ruin her entire mission. 

&quot;Damn...my sword needs some work...what were they saying. Holding it 
like this and...&quot; 

Kasumi relaxed a little and began considering climbing the large steel 
box to reach the pipes. She found a path that would lead to an air duct 
the probably led to the elevator shaft. 

&quot;Shi, shi, shi!&quot; The kunoichi suddenly lashed with her Gatana a couple 
of times and sheeted it quickly. &quot;Hah, shi, kyah!&quot; She continued while 
executing a short combination and using her sword at the second blow. 

&quot;Is she a total amateur?&quot; Kasumi wondered from her dark hiding place. 
She was practically invisible here but from what she knew the kunoichi 
might well be heading straight towards her. She swallowed one of the 
throat needles between her lips. 

&quot;Shi, whoa, matta, matta!&quot; The other kunoichi was now fully visible to 
Kasumi and it seemed she was still playing with her sword fighting 
invisible enemies while dancing around in a traditional manner. Was she 
a geisha as well? &quot;Shi, shi, shi-ne!&quot; 

There was a long line of blue light sparkling in the shadow where Kasumi 
was hiding. The Bakemonryu kunoichi looked around in confusion. It was 
no one there. The only thing she found was a rat cut in two halves. 

&quot;Baka-naaa...I guess you are getting too cocky...&quot; She said to herself 
in defeat. &quot;Oh well, back to the post, at least IF someone was here, 
he&#39;d be too occupied concerning his newly split personality too care 
about the target.&quot; 

Kasumi, unable to speak because of her hidden weapon, had to fight hard 
not to laugh as she slid into the air duct connected to the elevator 
shaft. 

***

&quot;20 minutes, and it looks like the guards just keep coming. It must be 
some really important documents.&quot; Ryu thought while looking at his 
sword. It was a masamune of the finest quality; not that cheap home made 
trash like his companion clan members used. Well, it had its drawbacks 
as well. He could never leave it behind, as he would be easily revealed. 
And it would take him a very long time to replace it. But as things were 
know he ill needed a sword that would possibly start breaking after a 
few blocked hits. This one would keep going forever, long after he had 
made sushi of his opponent&#39;s weapons. &quot;It sure is more than enough for 
these guys though.&quot; 

Ryu came to wonder how Kasumi was doing on her rather, if he had 
understood it right, insane mission. Bakemonryu was something you don&#39;t 
want to find in a dark alley, and definitely not catch you sneaking 
around. 

***

&quot;Easy enough.&quot; Kasumi had climbed up the wires of the elevator, and with 
that she avoided any traps that the elevator might bring with it. She 
had reached an air duct that led into the hall of where her target had 
been residing. However, the Bakemonryu were not totally ignorant. Most 
of the ducts on this floor were sealed off or rigged forcing her to 
travel down the hall and exit the ducts to enter his room from another 
direction. 

Kasumi looked out the duct and noticed a fine looking hallway with a 
blue carpet. Very few places to hide though. On her right side there was 
a room with many guards and a camera as well. But that was only a decoy, 
she knew from her sources that the Yakuza head was inside a room to her 
left. Only two guards there, and Yakuza as well. Why were there no 
ninjas here? To maybe hide that they were actually guarding the room the 
two hit men walked down a hall in turn. One walked down the direction 
Kasumi was in and the other down a hall in front of him. Also they were 
wearing different suits that the one&#39;s down the hall. The kunoichi 
waited for the one coming her direction to pass her and then she 
carefully climbed out the duct and put on the lid. 

If she had possessed the Bakemonryu &quot;muscle control&quot; technique she could 
have killed the guard and use his corpse to distract the other one. But 
now she was of the Fuuma ninja. However they had a few tricks their own. 
And in the ninja book, using dirty tricks is considered necessary rather 
than shameful. 

She picked out a small cape and put it over her head. It worked much 
like the Bakemonryu serum but had a superior effect on the invisibility 
department. However, a much-shortened time of effect made up for that. 
The cape of invisibility would only last a few seconds. That was 
however, more than enough for an expert assassin. 

&quot;Hey, who&#39;s there?&quot; The guard wondered as he thought he heard something. 
As he turned to different directions to look around Kasumi grabbed him 
by his mouth and snapped his neck. Kasumi&#39;s wonderful shapes appeared a 
second after the guard was killed. The cape fell towards the ground but 
disintegrated before it landed. 

As the other guard walked back down the hall he noticed nothing but his 
companion standing in a very weird position. He ran up to his fellow 
Yakuza member to find out what was wrong and in his haste he didn&#39;t 
notice the air duct opening again behind him. 

&quot;What the???&quot; He stammered as he noticed the other guard hanging from 
the ceiling in a very thin line. From sudden fear of his own life he 
turned around to call out for the others. &quot;The enemy...!!!&quot; 

Before he could finish the sentence his throat was cut off. Blood poured 
out and before he even had time put his hand on it his chest was impaled 
by the same blade and the man died instantly. 

&quot;Damn!&quot; 

***

&quot;I...I heard that!&quot; Kai said nervously. &quot;Did you hear it?&quot; 

&quot;Of course.&quot; Ayane said coldly while turning her pink haired head 
towards the door. 

&quot;I&#39;ll call the guards in the other room. Just make sure they don&#39;t get 
in here and it everything will be fine just.&quot; The Yakuza head said 
harshly feeling the sweat run down his forehead already. 

&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary.&quot; Ayane proclaimed and walked up the door. &quot;I 
will handle this personally.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t be so damn cocky. We have no idea of who&#39;s out there. They might 
be climbing into the room as we speak.&quot; Kai was obviously panicking and 
being an old man his heart would have to work hard in a situation like 
this. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have already planned this.&quot; Ayane said and nonchalantly 
opened the door. No one was there. She unsheeted her own sword and got 
into her kung fu like stance. &quot;Tell your men to pull out and get the 
other ninjas up here.&quot; 

&quot;NOW!&quot; She added, as Kai wasn&#39;t moving yet. 

Kai reluctantly picked up a radio and called for his men to withdraw and 
ask all of the ninja guards, if there were anyone left at all, to get up 
there on the double. 

&quot;I want them here ten minutes ago!&quot; He chanted. The door suddenly closed 
and a moan could be heard. &quot;Oh my god!&quot; 

&quot;Well, Kasumi, what a nice surprise.&quot; Ayane said nonchalantly. As she 
felt the Gatana press against her throat. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you just kill me? 
Mistook me for someone else?&quot; 

Kasumi growled, as she recognized the voice. The Ayane&#39;s new hair color 
had actually been enough to throw her off. She shrugged her head and 
kicked the door in as she would have to deal with it later, her rival 
half-sister would have to do as protection from bullets. She found Kai 
desperately trying to open up and climb out the window. 

&quot;Pathetic I know. But that&#39;s the kind of clients we get. Money is all 
you know.&quot; Ayane continued before feeling the blade pressing against her 
throat hard enough to draw blood. &quot;Not very talkative huh?&quot; 

Kasumi quickly made a circle of her lips and inhaled deeply. Just as she 
was about to fire her throat needle she felt Ayane do a sudden move to 
the side throwing her aim way off. In surprise she gasped and stumbled 
firing the needle a fragment of a centimeter wrong. Kai screamed as he 
was hit in his chest; it missed his heart however. 

&quot;Stop complaining. You&#39;ll live unless that dart was poisoned.&quot; Ayane 
said while making short work of the confused kunoichi catching her in a 
sleep hold. The full ninja team of the hotel stormed into the room from 
every angle. &quot;And these guys will take care of that.&quot; 

Kasumi gasped and fell to her knees, it was hard to breathe and she felt 
the blood flow to her brain slowing down under Ayane&#39;s grip. As the dark 
kunoichi let her go Kasumi fell limply to her side with a dizzy view of 
the world. 

&quot;That was way too slow, I&#39;ve been waiting for an eternity.&quot; Ayane said 
angrily while looking at her team trying to save Kai from having a 
serious heart attack. 

&quot;Yeah, for like 15 seconds.&quot; One of them replied sounding very cocky. 
Kasumi, even though at the brink of being unconscious, recognized the 
voice; it was that ninja girl from before. However, before she could do 
anything useful with the information Kasumi&#39;s view faded and she 
fainted. 

&quot;What was that???&quot; Ayane said harshly. &quot;Remember who is in command of 
this mission! YOU are coming with ME! And as for the rest of you, we 
have neutralized the threat so proceed to phase 2.&quot; 

&quot;What about me?&quot; The cocky kunoichi asked nervously and then tried to 
apologize. 

&quot;Don&#39;t disgrace yourself. Carry this kunoichi to my room.&quot; 

&quot;But shouldn&#39;t we...&quot; 

&quot;NOW!!!&quot; 

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am...&quot; 

***

&quot;There is a lot of activity down there. Only a few minutes and the 
documents should be delivered.&quot; Ryu thought. &quot;Why all this fuss to leave 
some documents? I could get to the other side of that door without even 
having to go through it.&quot; 

&quot;Mooove! We have to get him in there quickly! Get those guns here!&quot; One 
of the guards called out. 

&quot;Guns, does he mean actual guns or does he mean the Yakuza slang for 
ninja?&quot; Ryu wondered calmly. &quot;Anyway, time to get to work.&quot; 

&quot;Looks like the president is here. Quickly, get him into the office.&quot; 
The guard said and opened the door. 

&quot;I am afraid that will never happen.&quot; A voice said. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; 

&quot;Arigato!&quot; Ryu chanted as he appeared from over the door. He was hanging 
upside down and grabbed the guard, spun around while twisting that 
guard&#39;s neck and then dropped down. 

&quot;It&#39;s them again, shoot him!&quot; The president screamed. All the guards 
unloaded their weapons through the door but only succeeded in hitting 
the falling guard. As a few had to reload a shadow appeared next to one 
of them. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you know that playing with guns (ninjas) can be a dangerous line 
of work?&quot; It said and soon the guard was flying. Ryu grabbed the 
president and let his white sword lean again his neck. &quot;Now who is going 
to be a loyal follower of your boss and give me the documents?&quot; 

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; The old man asked. 

&quot;Playing dumb eh?&quot; Ryu said while noticing the guards aiming their 
weapons at him. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that&#39;&quot; He said coldly while trying not to 
let the blade touch the old man&#39;s skin as this could result in 
accidentally cutting off his entire head. 

&quot;Let him go!&quot; A voice from above him suddenly said. Ryu&#39;s felt something 
tightening around his throat and as he looked up he noticed a Bakemonryu 
hanging from the ceiling hold something, probably a thin wire, that 
couldn&#39;t be seen. &quot;We&#39;ve got you surrounded! If you give up now maybe we 
will give you a less painful death.&quot; 

&quot;Let me think about that...&quot; Ryu said mocking the ninja above him. 
&quot;...What about this; you remove this wire around my neck and I promise 
will pay for the coffin.&quot; 

The ninja above him laughed and tightened the line around his neck to 
the point where Ryu could barely breathe. &quot;No.&quot; 

&quot;Aww...come on, it&#39;s a &#39;try before you die&#39; deal...&quot; Ryu gasped. He 
tried moving around but the thread around his neck started pulling him 
upwards. Soon he couldn&#39;t breathe at all. However despite all the strain 
Hayabusa kept holding onto the president as protection. 

&quot;Now you got yourself into a situation.&quot; The Bakemonryu said 
sarcastically. &quot;Either you drop him and these guards will shoot you. Or 
you will die from suffocation. I am still wondering why you didn&#39;t 
sacrifice yourself to get the mission done and kill him.&quot; 

***

Ayane tied Kasumi&#39;s hands with great effort not wanting the girl to get 
loose on her. She had waited for the moment when she could get her hands 
on the red haired kunoichi, it been so long since they met last time. 
Ayane had studied a technique for years that would allow her to destroy 
the girl in every way possible and she was looking forward to the day 
when she would finally be able to master it. Right now however she would 
settle for torturing the girl for a while, and to make it more fun she 
needed the proper tools. 

After tying Kasumi&#39;s hands to her back tightly Ayane looked up at the 
ninja woman she had brought with her. Blame was supposedly related to 
the Bakemonryu clan&#39;s head mistress but that was the only reason Ayane 
ever brought her along. Sure she possessed exceptional endurance and 
durability but her technique was seriously flawed even though the girl 
was innovative enough to make up several techniques of her own. Ayane 
had found herself becoming Blame&#39;s personal tutor when it came to the 
ninjitsu art, not a good job considering Blame&#39;s reluctance to stick by 
the rules, but it felt good in a way to be so good at something that she 
was actually considered a tutor. 

&quot;Blame.&quot; Ayane said simply. &quot;Go guard the entrance, I will teach you 
about this when you get a bit older and more mature.&quot; If it was one 
thing the girl ninja hated it was being denied the knowledge of her 
elders, and Ayane knew this. 

&quot;I think I am ready...&quot; Blame insisted wanting to know what Ayane had on 
her mind. 

&quot;Think of it as a lesson in determination.&quot; Ayane snickered. &quot;If you do
good, I will give you the lesson of torture next time. Now go make sure
no personnel enters the room for whatever reason, when I am done we can
kick back for the rest of the night.&quot; 

&quot;But...&quot; Blame hissed. 

&quot;Just do it!&quot; Ayane said harshly while letting a hand caress the back
of Kasumi&#39;s silk dress impatiently. 

The girl bowed reluctantly and Ayane waved her off as she stepped 
through the door and disappeared to the other side after closing it 
behind her. With a pleased smile Ayane could now get to work. 

Sliding her hand down to the butt area of the unconscious kunoichi and 
patted it gently while reaching for a small box. She opened the box and 
inside she found the two pills that a fellow ninja had brought for her, 
they were the red and white ones with a name she couldn&#39;t pronounce and 
they had been declared illegal in most every country she knew of. Not 
that it bothered her, no one would find them when she was through. 

With a smile of pure evil Ayane moved Kasumi&#39;s dress up to reveal those 
plain white panties she used to wear. Ayane knew that they were her 
half-sister&#39;s lucky pair but they looked remarkably clean for something 
that was supposed to wear regularly. Pulling them down and catching one 
of the pills between her right index finger and thumb Ayane admired the 
sight before her for a few seconds before putting the pill into her 
mouth. It wasn&#39;t consumption however and she held onto it all while 
letting her tongue dance over it coating the pill with her saliva. 

&quot;Strange...&quot; Ayane said to herself. The pill tasted like strawberry, 
which was a bit odd considering where it was supposed to go. 

When to long pill as slippery enough Ayane took it out again and used 
her left index finger to poke Kasumi in the rear. The kunoichi groaned 
slightly and moved around slightly in her sleep. Ayane used her index 
and middle finger to separate Kasumi&#39;s cheeks and she giggled as the 
girl&#39;s secret folds were opened to her. The dark star was revealed and 
soon Ayane tried teasing it to swallow the pill for her, it took some 
work and Kasumi kept making noises of discomfort before Ayane was 
finally able to force the whole pill in and she used her finger to push 
it in further. 

When her knuckle reached the skin Kasumi&#39;s cheeks she stopped and moved 
out again. In order to proceed with this properly she would have to put 
the other one into herself. Ayane was unsure about whether or not she 
could go through with sleeping with her own half sister without some 
kind of drug induction. Her purpose remained the same however, exposing 
Kasumi to this torture was more important than having to live it 
herself. 

Ayane moaned slightly as she started working up her own behind to make 
room for the pill. 

***

&quot;Didn&#39;t...like...the...offer...h-huh?&quot; Ryu gasped he was allowed to take 
another gasp of air before the wire that was hanging from the Bakemonryu 
was once again tightened &quot;It seems this guy doesn&#39;t know what my real 
mission is. I am here for the documents and it would be useless to 
sacrifice myself because they would be taken back once I was dead...&quot; 

&quot;I am a ninja, what use would a coffin be to me? Once I&#39;m dead I don&#39;t 
care.&quot; The Bakemonryu said getting a bit impatient with Ryu&#39;s 
unwillingness to surrender. 

&quot;Isssss...that ssssssoooo...&quot; Ryu gasped and moved his armed hand up 
while dropping the president. With his last air Ryu cut off the wire 
with his sword and jumped in one movement. 

&quot;Shoot him!&quot; The Bakemonryu cried. But as the guards fired where Ryu 
would have landed they didn&#39;t hit anything. Only a few sakura leaves, 
green ones at that, were to be found. 

&quot;Damn it!&quot; The ninja cried again. &quot;Get the target out. And find him damn 
it!&quot; 

The guards escorted the president outside while the ninja stayed. &quot;Well 
now, aren&#39;t we tricky.&quot; He said while pulling out his sword. 

&quot;Let&#39;s just say I got a few ropes of my own.&quot; Ryu said while dropping 
down behind him. The ninja snarled and lashed backwards meeting with 
Ryu&#39;s sword. A kunai left Ryu&#39;s other hand though and it connected with 
the other ninja&#39;s forehead. The Bakemonryu groaned and fell backwards 
into a box of office supplies. 

&quot;If you had let go when I told you to...&quot; Ryu said coldly while sheeting 
his sword. &quot;...I would&#39;ve brought you a more expensive coffin.&quot; Soon the 
entire Bakemonryu ninja team sent in was over him however and Ryu had to 
bring his sword up once again. 

Almost dancing among the Bakemonryus, Ryu came to wonder why they were 
so disorganized. They were randomly attacking from all directions and 
there was no strong leader among to dish out orders and war cries like 
they used to. Hayabusa needed no one himself as he had practically taken 
on an army by himself at more than one occasion but the Bakemonryu was a 
team and there were few that ever worked on their own. 

He kicked low and rolled up to his hands and then spun around while 
kicking in several directions. Ryu then lashed out his sword to finish 
the one he had dropped. Another one appeared behind him descending in a 
true, cheap and cowardly manner. Ryu quickly grabbed his latest victims 
sword, threw it backward at his right side and lashed back with his left 
had. There was a sound from the ninja blocking the thrown sword, a 
scream as he landed on Ryu&#39;s to the right and then a meaty noise as it 
cut through flesh. 

Another body hung on the edge of his sword. Had Ryu had the sharp end 
upwards the body would have descended until it was in two, but he 
considered split bodies to be a little gross. 

&quot;Now for the president and the documents.&quot; 

***

Kasumi awoke slowly. Her view was blurred and her body was still numb 
but as she tried to move she could feel that was lying down on a very 
comfy bed, not to mention that her hands were tied to her back. Shaking 
her head Kasumi tried to focus and as her eyesight was regained she 
could see Ayane above her. 

&quot;So you finally woke up...&quot; Ayane panted in a very erotic manner and 
moved down to kiss her captive. It was obvious that she was very 
aroused. 

Kasumi moaned loudly into the kiss and struggled to get free but it only 
lead to even more discomfort as she could feel that Ayane had stripped 
both of them down to their skimpy underwear. Kasumi could also feel both 
her crotch and ass burning from sensations she would rather not discuss, 
it was as if Ayane had put one of her spells on her, Kasumi knew of no 
technique that worked as Aphrodisiac but she could bet her head that 
Ayane did. 

&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Ayane hummed as she finally released the girl 
from the lip lock. &quot;A little hotter than usual perhaps, if that&#39;s even 
possible.&quot; The dark kunoichi chuckled and it became apparent to her 
captive that she was under the same effects. 

&quot;What...what have you done to...to me...&quot; Kasumi panted trying to grind 
her legs together against her pussy. Her panties were still on however 
and they helped dampen the feel a little. 

&quot;Don&#39;t ask that...&quot; Ayane giggled. It must have been the first time in 
years that she did that as the dark kunoichi was usually dead serious 
all the time. &quot;You should be concerned about...&quot; Ayane reached down to 
grope Kasumi&#39;s crotch. &quot;What I WILL do to you.&quot; 

Kasumi moaned as she could feel Ayane&#39;s palm brush over her pantied sex. 
The situation was too intense for her to remember much about her 
mission, she had failed anyway...miserably. Kasumi whimpered as she 
could see Ayane straddling her and starting to caress her full body. 

&quot;Why...are you AH...d-doing thiiiis??&quot; Kasumi gasped loudly as she could 
feel Ayane moving her hands over her body leaving no area unexplored. 
&quot;It&#39;s not...right!&quot; The kunoichi cursed herself for submitting so easily 
to Ayane&#39;s games, but she knew that her half sister had something to do 
with her unnatural reaction to the whole thing. 

&quot;You don&#39;t like it?&quot; Ayane paused and moved up to Kasumi&#39;s face wanting 
to watch her facial expression. 

&quot;NO!&quot; Kasumi growled and struggled even more. 

&quot;Well there&#39;s your answer then.&quot; Ayane chuckled and once again moved 
down to kiss her captive on the lips. 

Of course it was. Kasumi remembered Ayane hating her ever since they 
were small kids, the crazy bitch was even willing to put herself through 
this if it meant Kasumi would have a problem with it, how hopelessly 
fanatic. The kunoichi found herself slowly submitting to Ayane&#39;s 
ministrations however and she could feel the dark kunoichi&#39;s hands 
caressing her thighs playfully. 

&quot;Oh god!&quot; Kasumi gasped as she was finally released from the kiss. She 
couldn&#39;t believe she was actually doing this, the only one she could 
think of that would think something like this up would be that wrestler 
Tina that she met in the last tournament she was in. That woman seemed 
to get turned on by everything and even though Kasumi, like many of her 
fellow kunoichi&#39;s, had fantasized about being with another woman, she 
couldn&#39;t really think of herself with that broad. No matter how 
attractive she was. 

Kasumi was brought back to reality as Ayane slapped her thigh playfully. 
She was actually thinking about Tina in that way, whatever Ayane had 
done to her Kasumi found herself thinking of Tina as more and more 
attractive and her half sister&#39;s caressing wasn&#39;t helping either. 

&quot;I think you want more my dear.&quot; Ayane said in a calm tone. She moved 
her hands down to Kasumi&#39;s back and reached for the clasp in her bra. 

Kasumi found herself too deep in her own dream world to even notice. As 
she felt the clasp opening and Ayane lifting the white material off 
Kasumi felt that she should have tried to resist, at least for show even 
though she wouldn&#39;t have been able to for long. Now Ayane would think 
that she was agreeing on this. 

&quot;Ahhh...lovely.&quot; Ayane sighed as she felt Kasumi&#39;s breasts up. She 
easily had the largest breasts out of all the kunoichis she had seen and 
that made her enjoy this even more. She would make Kasumi her slave of 
pleasure, and tomorrow she would think of something new and once she got 
tired of torturing her relative she would attempt the destruction that 
she had been practicing, it was a while until then however and her drugs 
were really helping. 

Kasumi felt Ayane go down on one nipple as she grabbed the other. It was 
quite a sensation to feel her breast being treated in such 
a...professional manner, she came to wonder if Ayane had done this 
before because she sure knew what she was doing. Kasumi let out a gasp 
as she couldn&#39;t resist any longer, the small walls she had managed to 
build fell down like Babel and the kunoichi allowed herself to feel 
pleasure. Her body bucked under Ayane&#39;s ministrations and the dark 
kunoichi switched to the other breast increasing her efforts on this one 
adding both tongue and lips to the nipple. 

&quot;Ohhh...oh god...I can&#39;t believe...this...&quot; Kasumi moaned as pleasure 
started to overwhelm her. She could feel Ayane&#39;s hand leave her breasts 
again only to move down and fondle her crotch once again. 

Ayane got more eager by the second, she couldn&#39;t stand this teasing and 
foreplay anymore, she wanted to fuck the kunoichi. Really good and 
really hard. After another minute of teasing and listening to Kasumi 
giving gasps of pleasure in an increasing pace she lost her control for 
a second and crashed down on Kasumi rubbing their bodies together. 
Wanting more Ayane pressed her own sex down on her captive&#39;s body 
ultimately ending up in a scissors position as she couldn&#39;t hold her 
lust back. 

Kasumi&#39;s world was about to go white when she could feel Ayane&#39;s crotch 
grind against her own and even with the soft cotton that separated them 
she was still overflowing. Kasumi rocked back and forth underneath Ayane 
and her moans had already turned into muffled cries of pleasure, however 
just as she was about to come Ayane got hold of herself again. 

Shaking her head for a few seconds to regain focus Ayane looked down on 
her captive. Kasumi was already trapped in her web of pleasure but she 
wasn&#39;t deep enough and she still had plans for the young woman. She gave 
Kasumi a superior smile before using her exceptional strength to flip 
her over making Kasumi land with her face in a pillow not being able to 
support herself due to her bondage. 

Ayane was still smiling as Kasumi&#39;s well shaped behind was once again 
presented to her. She had left the panties on in an attempt to keep the 
lust-inducing pill in there, but now it didn&#39;t matter as Kasumi was 
seriously drugged from it. Ayane remembered that she had forgotten 
something&#39; the alcohol that she had brought in case the pill wouldn&#39;t 
work. Leaving Kasumi for a second she opened to door to the hallway. 

***

Kai was still running. That murder machine was still after him and Kai 
was alone, with his bodyguards dying just a hundred yards away. He 
really needed to find a way out of here and fast. Running through the 
last hallway he could hear the screams of agony behind him suddenly 
seize, it seemed that the fight was over. This was a bad thing however 
as Kai had no idea who had won, and they all looked like ninjas as far 
as he knew. 

&quot;No matter who comes down that hallway.&quot; Kai pulled out his trusty gun, 
he only had one bullet left which was worrying. &quot;If he wears a mask I&#39;ll 
blast him to bits.&quot; 

Kai hugged the wall and didn&#39;t have to wait for long before a shadow 
dropped down in front of him. He aimed to gun at the shadow slowly as he 
could see Ryu step out in the light. 

&quot;Hold it right there!&quot; Kai cried in panic. &quot;What do you want???&quot; 

&quot;The documents.&quot; Ryu said coldly. &quot;And maybe something more from all the 
trouble you have caused me.&quot; The Hayabusa ninja started pulling out his 
sword again slowly. 

Kai was sure he was going to die right now if he didn&#39;t do anything and 
in panic he fired the gun but stood frozen instead of running off as he 
could see the ninja deflecting the bullet with his sword. He had never 
seen anyone react so fast, it was just unreal. This person was some kind 
of super human to be able to perform that and he had only heard about 
one person that would be a likely candidate to possess such exceptional 
skill level. Ryu Hayabusa, aka the super ninja. 

&quot;You...you&#39;re that...Ryu guy...aren&#39;t you?&quot; Kai stammered and started 
moving sideways. The ninja was still not moving so he started running 
down the corridor, t was the only chance he had left if he ever wanted 
get outside again. 

Ryu was still shaking when he saw the old man disappear into the 
darkness of the hallway. He had just deflected a bullet with his sword, 
which happens like&#39; one time in a million, if you are incredibly lucky. 
Ryu couldn&#39;t believe his luck and looked at the sword, he was so sure 
that he would be able to strike the man down as he fired and dodged the 
bullet. The shot had knocked his sword out the way however and thus Ryu 
had missed. 

&quot;Hey you!&quot; Ryu chanted getting back to his senses. &quot;Come back here!&quot; 

***

&quot;Blame...Blame!&quot; Ayane looked through the door but couldn&#39;t see her 
ninja student anywhere in the room. &quot;Oh, just typical.&quot; Ayane quickly 
put on her purple skirt and walked into the room. 

&quot;Blame Specter where the hell are you!?&quot; There was no answer. 

With a growl Ayane stepped into the room and looked for the big bottle 
of vodka that he had brought but couldn&#39;t remember where she had put it. 
Not to mention that the room was still turned upside down from their 
little raid before. On a small table in front of the TV was a tin filled 
with ice and a bottle of champagne however and in fact it was much 
better for the task at hand. Ayane grabbed the bottle and returned to 
her room again. 

&quot;Hey! You can&#39;t leave yet, we still have to celebrate.&quot; Kasumi was 
trying to crawl out of the bed but Ayane put a stop to that in a hurry 
and put her back in the position she was before. She took the bottle of 
champagne and started shaking it when she had got Kasumi back in order 
again with her butt in the air. 

Kasumi was about answer something when she could hear a loud pop feel 
the cork bounce off her behind before the icy foam spewed out onto her. 
The kunoichi let out a long moan of shock as she could feel the cold 
liquid swiftly drenching her pantied behind and running down into all 
her private areas. As the flow stopped she was in for another surprise 
as Ayane pushed the top of the flask in between her cheeks to nuzzle her 
pantied anus in an attempt to bring fort some fancy reacting. Kasumi 
cried out from excitement, no matter how weird it was and felt she was 
still getting really turned on by this. 

Ayane rolled the flask back and forth until it was about an inch inside 
Kasumi and empty before she pulled it out again and watched Kasumi&#39;s wet 
panties before her before pulling down as well. She smacked the wet 
behind and watched some fluid fly of like she had smacked a puddle of 
water. This was really turning the kunoichi on and she couldn&#39;t resist 
giving the bubbly but a kiss, and then a lick, and another kiss. It was 
too cool for the room. 

&quot;That was interesting.&quot; Ayane said and licked her lips. &quot;You know what 
comes now?&quot; She asked and started undressing once again pulling the 
skirt off. The rest of her clothes followed. 

&quot;No...&quot; Kasumi whispered nervously. 

&quot;I get to fuck you.&quot; Ayane was pulling something on in place of her 
panties. Kasumi knew all too well what it was as she had heard Tina talk 
about it a lot. &quot;How would you like that?&quot; 

Kasumi didn&#39;t reply. She just gasped as Ayane grabbed her feet and 
pulled her closer to the edge of the bed so that she could reach 
properly. The dark kunoichi positioned herself and let the rubber shaft 
that she wore slide against Kasumi&#39;s wet folds teasing the girl a little 
while trying to keep a hold of herself. 

&quot;Would you like that?&quot; Ayane asked again while placing her hands on 
Kasumi behind. It was to slippery to hold however so she moved them 
further up taking old of Kasumi&#39;s naked sides while pulling her back an 
inch letting the tip of the rubber shaft poke her captive internally 
before she pulled out. &quot;Would you like me to fuck you?&quot; 

Kasumi&#39;s mind was totally rioting. Her mind knew it was wrong and that 
she would regret any further submission to Ayane&#39;s games while her body 
was screaming with lust and begging her for something inside. If she 
hadn&#39;t been bound Kasumi would have to figh hard not to start caressing 
herself. 

To encourage her captive a little Ayane started pushing forward ever so 
slowly. The unit pushed in between Kasumi&#39;s lips and parted them to 
enter her sex as the dark kunoichi carefully entered her. Kasumi let out 
a large gasp while arching her head upwards as she could feel Ayane 
doing a few very short pushed back forth before slowly moving forward 
again until the whole rubber shaft was buried inside. 

&quot;If you ask me to you know I will.&quot; Ayane whispered while watching 
Kasumi going wild from the torture. It was obvious that she was both 
hating it and loving ever second of it at the same time and it brought 
the dark kunoichi so much satisfaction seeing her captive like this. 
&quot;And if you beg for it I will untie you as well.&quot; Ayane started moving 
back to let her strap-on get some air. 

Kasumi broke down completely with this. &quot;Please Ayane!&quot; She said almost 
crying as she admitted defeat. &quot;Fuck me! Fuck me good!&quot; She pushed her 
behind back onto Ayane not letting the shaft exit her. 

This was all the dark kunoichi needed to hear and she instantly pushed 
in and lost herself in lust as she could hear Kasumi let out an ecstatic 
moan. She had known no greater joy than hearing her rival and 
half-sister scream in agony before, but hearing her cry out in pleasure 
as she was molested by her worst enemy was so exciting it was just 
untrue. 

&quot;Oh that&#39;s it!&quot; Kasumi moaned. &quot;Please Ayane, fuck me good. Please take 
me, oh please, oh please oh pleassssse!&quot; She was really getting into 
this, and the begging was better than Ayane had expected. 

When she had untied Kasumi like promised Ayane continued her thrusts 
while giving Kasumi the occasional slap on her behind. She didn&#39;t get 
much from it physically but seeing the beautiful body rock underneath 
her in combination with all the mental pleasures she found in the 
situation it didn&#39;t matter to her. Kasumi was still crying for more and 
was moving with the other kunoichi with each thrust like a wild animal. 

&quot;Oh Ayane! Please give more more and more and mooore!&quot; Kasumi cried. 
&quot;Fuck me! Fuck me you crazy bitch! Fuck me oooooh!!!&quot; 

Wanting to take advantage of her in every way possible Ayane added a wet 
finger to Kasumi&#39;s anus. Not pushing it in as she didn&#39;t want to connect 
with the pill if it hadn&#39;t dissolved yet she started rubbing it along 
the dark surface instead instantly presenting a new dimension of 
excitement to Kasumi&#39;s body. 

&quot;Come for me!&quot; Ayane panted while still humping the other kunoichi great 
effort. &quot;Come for me you little slut! Come for me damn it!&quot; She 
continued returning some of the bad language Kasumi had let out before. 
She couldn&#39;t believe that Kasumi had such a bad mouth in bed, she was 
such a sweet girl normally. 

As on command Kasumi suddenly arched back landed against Ayane&#39;s chest 
in a loud cry of ecstasy. Ayane could feel her shuddering as the orgasm 
ran though her body like a liquid lightning and it seemed to last for 
almost two minutes before Kasumi collapsed on the bed in a final gasp of 
exhaustion.

&quot;I guess he died from a heart attack.&quot; Ryu concluded while searching the 
old man for the documents. The man had suddenly collapsed just as he 
reached his car, how ironic. &quot;Aha this is it, the payroll of every 
Bakemonryu working for this family.&quot; Ryu was pleased to finally be able 
to complete the job at hand. Just out of curiosity he searched the man 
some more to see if he could find some more useful information. 

&quot;I guess I&#39;ll have to make a few crosses here and there but at least I 
completed my mission. Wait a minute! This is the Jinrai family!&quot; Ryu 
gasped as he realized who this was. &quot;I did both missions at once??? And 
in that case, where is Kasumi???&quot; 

Hayabusa hurried inside again to look around the building for survivors 
he could ask. Almost an hour later Ryu complained about his own ruthless 
efficiency for the first time since he had started his career. He would 
simply have to go back to ask the master about what to do. 

***

Kasumi was awakened once again by something pushing in between her lips. 
It was soft and it tasted almost like honey. She hummed a little opened 
her eyes and coughed as she could see Ayane attempting to deep throat 
her with the rubber strap-on she had used earlier. The white material 
was already well inside Kasumi&#39;s mouth and she could easily taste her 
sexual fluids from before. It was exciting in a way but the drug was 
already starting to wear off. 

&quot;Now be a good girl and swallow.&quot; Ayane said in an exhausted tone. &quot;I 
wanted to do you in the ass first but we&#39;ll save that for later.&quot; She 
smiled but her eyes appeared hallow and it was obvious that Ayane needed 
some rest. Also Kasumi wasn&#39;t about to stick around to be submitted to 
any more of Ayane&#39;s ideas no matter how exciting the sounded in her 
current state. 

&quot;Do you like that?&quot; Ayane asked again in a tired voice. &quot;Maybe you would 
have wanted some off your butt on that as well?&quot; The dark kunoichi 
collapsed on the bed beside her and Kasumi didn&#39;t waste any time in 
escaping. 

&quot;Hey...where are you going!?&quot; Ayane groaned being too weak to stop her. 

Kasumi grabbed her suit and disappeared out the window with a reply. 
Ayane cursed her bad luck for a few minutes and when she had the 
strength to move again she started putting her regular clothes back on. 
She pulled the strap-on off and started licking the remnants of Kasumi&#39;s 
love juices off still taking great delight in doing so even if it served 
no purpose but satisfying herself. 

&quot;Still...&quot; She mumbled. &quot;I still left my permanent mark on you.&quot; The red 
mark on Ayane&#39;s back seemed to glow when she threw her head back in an 
insane laughter that wouldn&#39;t stop echoing for minutes. 

***

&quot;Where is the master???&quot; Ryu chanted as he burst through the doors that 
lead in the quarters of his masters office. 

&quot;What is wrong???&quot; A smaller female ninja asked him as she walked up to 
him quickly stopping the upset ninja in his path. 

&quot;Ibuki right?&quot; He asked and looked at her nodding. &quot;I need to have a 
chat with the master of this clan. So if you&#39;ll excuse me.&quot; He tried 
pushing her aside. 

&quot;He doesn&#39;t want to be disturbed!&quot; Ibuki said pushed him off her now out 
in front of him with her arms stretched out. 

&quot;What are you talking about? I completed my mission he should be here 
greeting me.&quot; Ryu growled and pushed the smaller ninja out of the way. 

&quot;But...&quot; Ibuki tried. 

Ryu pushed the slid the door to the side and looked in. 

&quot;MASTER!!!&quot; He gasped. In front of him was a scene the ninja would never 
expect, his master screwing over some ninja girl that had started 
training here only a few weeks ago. &quot;Immoral.&quot; He snarled. 

&quot;Did you get the documents?&quot; The ninja master asked nonchalantly. 

&quot;Yes of course but...&quot; 

&quot;Well then give it to Ibuki here and I&#39;ll see you in...say 30 minutes.&quot; 
The master continued after cutting him short him. 

&quot;But oh...master...I can show you my...uuuuhhhh...secret technique...it 
always works at least twice...&quot; The girl beneath him moaned. 

&quot;Make that sixty...&quot; The master added before he ordered Ryu to leave. 

Hayabusa closed the door and went the in-house cafe with Ibuki tailing 
him. 

&quot;At least you will have plenty of time to study your next mission.&quot; She 
said and gave him a cup of green tea as they sat down. 

Ryu gave her a very ironic but hard to read look. 

***

&quot;The police are now investigating the mysterious death of Kai Jinrai 
suspected to be the head of the Jinrai Yakuza. He was found earlier this 
morning sitting in the back of his limousine. The police stated that he 
had probably died from a heart attack and even though the mysterious 
circumstances the police state that there is not enough evidence to 
start a further investigation as there are no witnesses or other bodies 
around. This is Lonzo Grandal JNN and good night.&quot; 

***

&quot;What??? You planned all this???&quot; Ryu almost shouted. 

&quot;Of course, I told you that Kasumi was better fitted for this mission. 
That is distracting the Bakemonryu team leader. Which from the looks of 
it she did very well.&quot; The Fuuma ninja master gave for an answer. &quot;We 
knew they were using a very skilled spy and couldn&#39;t afford telling you 
the true motives of the missions. The Bakemonryu expected us to send our 
best ninja to do the job and so they sent their best namely Ayane.&quot; 

&quot;But why? If you had just told me to get to the office building and 
assassinate Kai there it would have been enough and Kasumi would still 
be here.&quot; Ryu asked feeling confused. 

&quot;You don&#39;t get it? If Ayane had been there the ninja team that defended 
Kai would have worked twice as good together. And not even our best 
assassin ever had even a slight chance against Ayane, and even less her 
and her entire team. I doubt that even you would stand up against them.&quot; 
The master sounded very serious and he made lots of gestures while 
talking. 

Ryu almost laughed at this remembering how he had slain creatures far 
worse than the Bakemonryu at many occasions. However he was bothered 
with his master sending Kasumi for a suicide mission that he didn&#39;t 
expect Ryu complete. 

&quot;So, you are saying, sacrifice Kasumi for the good cause. Couldn&#39;t you 
at least have sacrificed someone with less skill?&quot; He protested thinking 
of Kasumi being next to him in skill as well as what would gain the 
clan. &quot;Just THROW away our talents!&quot; 

&quot;Actually as you know all ninjas are expendable but the point is we know 
that Ayane has a thing for Kasumi and that she wouldn&#39;t kill her just 
like that. With her distracting Ayane&#39;s attention you completed your 
mission with ease and Kasumi, well, at least she won&#39;t be killed at 
first sight and there is a chance that she might get away.&quot; 

&quot;Sensei!&quot; A woman&#39;s voice could be heard from behind him. &quot;Is this YOUR 
doing???&quot; 

***

Blame awoke after a very pleasant dream about 30 minutes later. She 
quickly got up and noticed Kasumi was gone! She cursed herself for not 
being able to stay awake this once. Blame was lying on the floor 
sleeping like a baby naturally. 

Her radio sparkled. 

&quot;Yes? Yes this is Ayane...Everything went as planned...WHAT??? ANOTHER 
NINJA??? IN THE OFFICE BUILDING??? Yes...yes of course...I&#39;ll be there 
right away...&quot; 

Ayane turned off the radio and suddenly realized the entire plot. Not 
only had she been fooled, had her paycheck stolen, lost a client and her 
entire ninja team minute but also she had lost Kasumi. And it was 
probably the last time she would get her hands on the beautiful kunoichi 
so easily. 

&quot;DAMN YOU FUUMA NINJA!&quot; Ayane cried dramatically. 

&quot;And damn you god, when you create such a wonderful being couldn&#39;t I at 
least get to keep her.&quot; Blame hissed suddenly popping out of her hiding 
place in the room. As soon as she did however she noticed something 
white on the floor. &quot;Yes! So there always comes something good out of 
the bad!&quot; She proclaimed and hurled herself over the white cotton 
panties. &quot;HAHAHA!!!&quot; 

&quot;What the HELL are YOU doing in here!?&quot; Ayane growled. 

&quot;Uhm...room service?&quot; Blame said weakly and watched Ayane jump at her. 
It would be a long time before Ayane would stop spanking the girl 
silly...



Author&#39;s Notes: 

This story I wrote just for fun during a few nights of insomnia so it&#39;s 
not very serious in ways of following the DoA story line but on the 
other hand, it doesn&#39;t try to be and isn&#39;t supposed to be. =) Just think 
of it as a story with Kasumi and Ryu on adventures. 

Useless but noteworthy: 

I broke my personal record of written pages per day with this one: the 
old one being ten and the new one being 16.</pre>
