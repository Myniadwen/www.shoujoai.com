<pre>Author&#39;s Notes 
The usual jazz applies here. I don&#39;t own either Ayane, Kasumi, Genra or 
Hayate. I don&#39;t own Dead or Alive or the concepts of the Mugen Tenshin 
Tenjin/Hajin-mon or anything related to either of them. They belong to 
Tecmo and Team Ninja and whatnot. And let it be known that this is a 
shoujo-ai story; i.e. girl-girl love. If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t read 
it. There&#39;s plenty of other DOA fanfics around. Okay, on we go.

The Moth and the Flame 

**********

Katsuragi Forest, Osaka Prefecture, Japan 

Of all the forestry of Honshu island in the nation of Japan, Katsuragi 
Forest stood out in some palpable but inexplicable way. It was prevalent 
with nature&#39;s bounty. The ground was paved graciously with light emerald 
blades of grass and thickening roots woven into the soil. Those roots 
aligned with the tall and overpowering trees of the forest. Along them 
were the thick and supporting branches, laden with vines and moss that 
had gathered over the years. Within the heart of the forests were the 
animals that grazed there for nourishment. Tiny pouting-cheeked 
squirrels nuzzled themselves in the underside of many of those tree 
roots. Certain birds both unique and non-unique to Japan landed upon the 
twig-made nests they had constructed for themselves in the high repose 
of their trees. Geological and Naturalist researchers alike often came 
here to Katsuragi to observe the concord and beauty of this place in 
their spare time. But the peace of the forest was every so often 
disturbed by forces beyond the knowledge or control of the animals that 
dwelled within them... or the people who observed it all as an 
occupation. Little to the common knowledge, places like &#39;Katsuragi 
Forest&#39; were playgrounds for those kinds of forces. 

And six of those &#39;forces&#39; happened to be moving through it now.

	Birds launched from the perch of their nests and flocked into the 
air, fleeing the roof of the treetops and out into the cool morning sky, 
their haste caused by the movements being undertaken in the forest 
itself. A blur of movement vaulted from branch to branch of the trees 
that were strewn out across the woodland. To the human eyes it would 
have appeared to have been no more than a rough zephyr blowing through 
the branches. To the trained human eye; it would have revealed a certain 
kunoichi A woman shinobi who had resigned a sad heart to the life of the 
outlaw at the behest of necessity. A female ninja who had betrayed the 
Mugen Tenshin in its hour of disarray in order to satiate personal 
desires provoked by her love for her brother. That one was known as 
Kasumi. The one who abandoned her seemingly fated role to undertake her 
place of leadership of the Mugen Tenshin Tenjin-mon 

The Runaway Kunoichi.

	The chestnut-haired woman jumped across the many aerial brushwood 
of Katsuragi Forest&#39;s trees with all the superhuman speed blessed upon 
her by her ninja training The path was moving ever northward. But there 
were five shadows behind her. And she had become aware of their 
existence moments ago. The question was if they knew that she was aware. 
Kasumi cast a careful eye behind her; being sure not to alert them of it 
as she jumped across the trees. Five Mugen Tenshin ninja had been 
mobilized by the clan this time. It was not a large number considering 
the gravity of her crimes. But with the skill at their fingertips; it 
was clear that this was no ordinary attack squad. The five ninja trailed 
after the seemingly unaware Kasumi and readied themselves, then 
suddenly; all five of them shot their hands into the pouches behind 
their backs and withdrew ten kunai (two for each hand of each shinobi). 
And in one more act of unison they threw all ten of the kunai at Kasumi 
as they all dashed through the trees. Kasumi swung herself around and 
gasped when the ten metal throwing daggers were cast in her direction. A 
cry of agony was heard as each kunai made its mark. Two of them lanced 
her in the right leg, drawing blood. Another four were impaled in her 
left leg. Two nailed her in the left arm. And the remaining two stabbed 
Kasumi in either shoulder. None of the kunai had hit a vital spot. But 
then that was not the intention. The intention was to disable at this 
point. The girl shrieked and was plucked from the branches. The five 
Mugen Tenshin ninja watched Kasumi&#39;s body drop from the trees and down 
into one of the large bushes of the forest floor. They then jumped down 
from the trees themselves and landed on the grounds next to them. Four 
of the ninja remained stationary at that point While the one who seemed 
to be leading the group, Ninja #1, advanced on the bushes that Kasumi 
had fallen into. He rushed up to them and pulled them apart. But he was 
forced to gasp when he saw what was in them. A one-leafed log of oak, 
which happened to have ten kunai embedded in them.

&quot;Shit!&quot; The ninja cursed, &quot;An illusion!?&quot; 

	All of a sudden, an unharmed and very determined Kasumi rushed 
down at Ninja #1 violently The man gasped when a quick but powerful blow 
extended from the leg of the girl, cracking his jaw back like peanut 
brittle. He toppled over and screeched, clutching at a jawbone which had 
obviously been shattered. Kasumi landed on the grass right ahead of him 
and faced off with the four others that had been under that man&#39;s 
service. Two of them reached into their pouches once more and hurled 
four shuriken at the woman. Kasumi reached back swiftly and withdrew the 
short sword attached to her waist. When the shuriken came hurtling for 
her, she struck at each of them in turn with a sleek and fluid wave of 
her blade. Metal clashed with metal -- the sound vibrating throughout 
the forest -- and all four of the throwing stars were repelled. But when 
Kasumi looked back at the ones who had thrown them, she saw that only 
two of the shinobi were standing there. Her ears then caught onto the 
distinct sound of battle cries. The brown-haired woman looked upwards 
and saw the other two, Ninja #2 and #4, looming over her in a downwards 
spiral. She acted fast and sheathed her blade; then began a systematic 
series of back flips. Each one of which placed her a little ways further 
out of harm&#39;s way. By the time the two ninja landed on the ground where 
their missed target had been, Kasumi was more than twelve metres away. 
Ninja #3 and #5 followed up the failure of their brethren and charged 
the girl. They drew their own short swords during this. Kasumi narrowed 
her eyes and did the same, unsheathing her sword, while Ninjas #5 and #3 
neared her. Ninja #3 was the first to act and slashed at Kasumi 
horizontally. The runaway parried the slash with one of her own and made 
her lightning-fast reprisal She kicked hard into his stomach; forcing 
Ninja #3 to lurch forward. With that sheathed her blade once more and 
grabbed him by the neck. Kasumi swung herself around his head with both 
arms whilst extending her leg. The incoming Ninja #5 was pelted across 
the face by her swinging kick; and knocked backwards into the dry soil 
and grass. Kasumi swung herself back around the head of the third ninja, 
but this time tightened the grip. The clash of tension between the skull 
and the spinal column was inevitable. A second and a half later the 
horrific sound of a neck bone snapping in half could be heard. Kasumi 
winced at it; as well as at the dying chokes of her victim. But she 
continued unabated and propelled herself forward from Ninja #3&#39;s now 
misshapen neck. While he dropped dead, Kasumi lunged down at the 
grounded body of Ninja #5 and unsheathed her short sword yet again. She 
brought its edge to the man&#39;s neck and solemnly spoke;

&quot;I&#39;d ask you to leave... but there&#39;s no hope for that, is there?&quot;

	The man didn&#39;t even need to reply to that; even if Kasumi had 
given him the time to do so. With a heartfelt frown she slashed across 
the crux of the man&#39;s throat, tearing through the arch of his neck. 
Blood choked him to death in mere seconds. But Kasumi only withdrew her 
bloodied sword and leaped upwards from Ninja #5&#39;s corpse. 
	Her movements were so swift that she once again appeared as no 
more than a blur. She jumped speedily up the trunk of one of the 
thousands of trees that occupied Katsuragi Forest until she was once 
again standing upon its branch. The remaining ninja, #2 and #4, had 
vanished. But the disappearing act did not last long. One of them, Ninja 
#2, materialized mid-air in a charging vault towards Kasumi&#39;s branch The 
other descended on her from above. Both of them had withdrawn their 
swords Kasumi sighed and used her left hand to make the two-fingered 
sign of the shinobi By shutting her eyes she disappeared once more with 
the rough chime of blur movement She quickly reappeared before the 
aerial-borne Ninja #2 with such speed that he was unable to counter it. 
Kasumi cried out femininely and thrust her elbow into the shinobi&#39;s 
face. His jaw line cracked just like that of his leader before him, and 
the sudden pain and force of the strike caused him to drop his blade 
With more of her kunoichi speed Kasumi leaned back in the air and thrust 
both her sandaled feet into Ninja #2&#39;s stomach. Using her own leverage 
and her target&#39;s body as a springboard; she propelled herself backwards 
with a somersault. As she flipped backwards (and a stunned Ninja #2 
dropped out of the air) she launched herself at the incoming Ninja #4. 
When her body evened out she swung her fist at him. This time he was 
quicker than his cohorts. He leaned back and avoided it, whilst pulling 
out a shuriken. Kasumi yelped when Ninja #4 cast that shuriken at an odd 
angle; towards her ankle. It slashed her, cutting under the fabric of 
her shin guards and leggings. Blood was drawn and Kasumi wobbled 
unceremoniously afterward. The opportunity Ninja #4 had been waiting for 
came and he slashed at Kasumi with his sword. The girl caught his wrist 
seconds before the blade connected with her face -- and the two dropped 
out of the air with each other, reaching the pinnacle of their jump&#39;s 
momentum. A desperate struggle began between the last of the five 
shinobi and Kasumi as they plummeted to the ground head first. 
	Kasumi held the man&#39;s sword back as best as she could, while Ninja 
#4 pulled back his free hand to punch her. Kasumi tucked her head to one 
side and dodged the punch, her auburn ponytail whipping about her head. 
It was the break in concentration she needed and she regressed the 
pressure her hand had on the ninja&#39;s wrist. Not realizing what she 
intended to do, the last of the Mugen Tenshin attack squad sliced with 
his newly freed sword; seemingly slicing the head right off her 
shoulders. He blinked once. And when he opened his eyes again he saw 
that he had merely chopped the top off of another log of wood. He gasped 
at the failure of his technique and lost sight of her. It was too late 
for him to do anything about it when he collided with the ground 
head-first. A scrambled cry was heard when Ninja #4&#39;s head splintered 
into shards of bloody bone and brain matter against the forest floor. 
The soil of Katsuragi Forest was not hard; but at that height any fall 
could kill. 
	It was the end of that attempt on Kasumi&#39;s life. Three of the five 
had been killed and the other two would be out of commission for some 
time. The blue and white ninja clad woman landed down to the forest 
floor at a slow rate and quickly caught her breath. But when she put 
pressure on her ankle she remembered what had happened up on the branch. 
A shuriken had injured her. In the heat of battle that injury hadn&#39;t 
seemed to be much. But now that the fight was over she was starting to 
feel it. 
	Kasumi grit her teeth and struggled to stand evenly. She would 
have to find somewhere in the forest to camp for the night, then apply 
some treatment to her wound. It would be a gamble; but trying to move on 
a wounded limb would just cause deeper injury. Kasumi cast her sad 
golden brown eyes away from the decimated and bloodied remainders of the 
Mugen Tenshin&#39;s minuscule assassination squad and hobbled away. 
	Perhaps it was because of her injury that she had not realized 
that three others had watched what had just transpired. They stood 
together on one of the thick branches of the trees. Two of them were 
just ordinary ninja of the clan, dressed in the same grey shinobi 
outfits of the men that Kasumi had just defeated. But the one leading 
them was far from insignificant. A kunoichi dressed in fine violet and 
red shinobi clothing, with a large bow attached to the back of them. She 
possessed short lavender hair and eyes that held the deepest and most 
expressive shade of red that someone so beautiful could ever hope to ask 
for. The most prolific prot&#130;g&#130;e of Genra and arguably one of the most 
promising young shinobi in the land; along with Kasumi herself. She was 
the woman they referred to as the &#39;Female Tengu&#39;. 

Ayane. 

The second of Ayane&#39;s ninja companions spoke as they all watched her 
leave. &quot;Impressive. This chase had lasted for longer than anyone of us 
had hoped that it would... and now I see why. I thought that Master 
Hayate had only been embellishing when he spoke of her strength in the 
past, but...&quot;

	&quot;If you talk like that then you&#39;ve given up already,&quot; Ayane barked 
scathingly, &quot;If you wanna lick at the girl&#39;s boots then do so. Seconds 
before I destroy you.&quot;

	The second of the ninja tightened up and silenced himself. He may 
have been larger and physically stronger than she was. But he was well 
aware of the power of the Woman Tengu. No one in the Mugen Tenshin 
Hajin-mon had the level of skill that Ayane did... no one other than 
Genra. The first of her partners adjusted the wrapping around his face 
and said; &quot;It was a wise move sending in drones to weaken her. Normally 
I would have thought that this would stay the Tenjin-mon&#39;s business, 
but... the Master was quite clear...&quot;

Ayane sighed irritably. &quot;Stop bleating about it. Master Genra was 
explicit and... that&#39;s just how it is. But we&#39;ll leave the rest of this 
up to me. She&#39;ll try and cloak her energy signature before nightfall so 
tracking her down will be easier on my own. Send word to Master Genra.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure you want to pursue her on your own?&quot; Asked the first of 
the shinobi.

	The lavender-haired woman scowled and lowered her head. &quot;Don&#39;t 
make me repeat myself just follow my orders. I can handle her on my own. 
What I didn&#39;t do at the Dead or Alive Tournament I&#39;ll do now. Now just 
get going!&quot;

	Both ninja nodded with uniform cries of &#39;yes ma&#39;am&#39; and leapt up 
into air, vanishing. This left Ayane behind. The girl stood on the tree 
branch By now Kasumi was out of sight. But she could easily find her. 
The Woman Tengu closed her eyes and made the two-fingered sign. From her 
soft pink lips came the muttering of a chant, one that invoked the 
mystical and ancient principles of Mugen Tenshin Hajin-mon ninjutsu. 
Slowly a glittering footprint of gold appeared on the ground more than 
thirty metres below Ayane. Another appeared ahead of it but with an 
opposing arc. And another one came ahead of that as well. A trail of 
footprints extended from that one point and inched deeper into the 
forest. Those were the spiritual representation of Kasumi&#39;s tracks. 
Ayane opened her eyes and smiled darkly.

&quot;Keep running, little bitch,&quot; She seethed presumptuously, &quot;I&#39;m always 
three steps behind you.&quot;

**********

&quot;Do you know what he said 
	when he coughed up his lifeblood?
&#39;Accept a corn of wheat fallen 
	to the ground and die it abideth alone!&#39;
Wheat, eh?
	There&#39;s enough of it.
We can afford to waste as much as we want...&quot;

**********

Night fell swiftly.

	More than fourteen hours had passed since Kasumi&#39;s clash with the 
ninja sent from the Mugen Tenshin to kill her. With their defeat she had 
proceeded even deeper into the trees and vines of Katsuragi. By now she 
had settled in a small clearing in the forest. It was surrounded by 
dense bushes and overhung by more trees. Thanks to that, the clearing 
would not stand out from an aerial point of view; which made the 
prospect of spending the night here more comforting. Kasumi had come to 
this clearing a few hours ago and began making the necessary 
preparations for her stay She rustled up some firewood and used her 
spiritual energy to ignite a fire. She had gathered together some nearby 
rocks as well so that she could cordon off the flames to stop them from 
spreading embers onto the grass around it. After that it was just a 
matter of getting something to eat. With all her ninja training, Kasumi 
knew that she could last at least five weeks without food and two weeks 
without water. But that took into consideration the minimal amount of 
energy use. To keep ahead of the shinobi hunting her and to fight them 
off should they happen to catch up with her again; she would need her 
full strength. In which case feeding was in order. There was no lake or 
river nearby to catch fish from; so the woman was forced to trap and 
kill one of the hares that ran around the bushes for sustenance While 
the skinned carcass of that creature cooked on a stick over the fire; 
Kasumi went about tending to her injury.
	Her first act was to remove each piece of her clothing. The blue 
and white garbs she wore while on the run were shed from her body, along 
with her white leggings and sandals, as well as her wrist/shin guards 
and short sword. Her gear was rested on the short grass next to her by 
the crackling fire, which left her body concealed only by her white 
underwear and the slip that kept her ponytail in place. But Kasumi&#39;s 
attentions remained on her ankle. Now that her leggings were removed she 
could see the wound. It was light, not all that deep considering how 
sharp Mugen Tenshin shuriken could be; but it was still slowing her 
down. It was just a good thing that Kasumi had the means to do something 
about it. Without second thought she reached beside her and grabbed the 
lower pelt of her ninja top. She then ripped the bottom part of it off. 
Kasumi took the torn piece of fabric and reached into the underside of 
the garment for something else. It was a small and un-labelled jar. 
Kasumi put down the fabric and opened the lid of the jar, frowning at 
the pungent odour that emanated from within. Though it didn&#39;t look or 
smell like much, it was one of the many secrets of the Mugen Tenshin 
Tenjin-mon A balm created with spirit water and a particular set of 
crushed herbs and fruit leaves. It had a property which hastened the 
healing of bruises and broken bones; as well as helping to re-weave the 
flesh of an open wound without leaving any scarring. That was what 
Kasumi needed from it now. So she dipped two of her fingers into the 
goop of the jar and took a sample. She then grit her teeth and seethed 
violently as she spread that gelatinous substance over the cut on her 
ankle. The stinging was also a drawback of the concoction, but beggars 
couldn&#39;t be choosers. This was really best she could do for herself 
outside of a hospital. After she (slowly and painfully) applied the balm 
to her injury, Kasumi closed the lid of the jar and took up that ripped 
piece of her uniform. She tied it around her ankle -- tight but without 
heavy pressure -- to secure it for now. Kasumi exhaled after that and 
lay back over the green blades of the grass, casting her eyes up to the 
starry night skies above. You couldn&#39;t get a clear view of the stars in 
the cities because of all the pollution and light. But in the country, 
the night out here granted a wonderful view of them, and allowed people 
to bask in an unfettered moonlight. Considering how much crap Kasumi 
went through day in and day out as a runaway ninja... small pleasures 
like a good view of the stars might not seem very significant or even 
important. But they were important to Kasumi. Seeing such beautiful 
things in a world saturated by the will of super-conglomerates like 
DOATEC and God-players like those of the Superhuman Development Project, 
was a good sign. It meant that life was still worth fighting for. 

Kasumi sighed as she looked up at the stars. &quot;...I wonder how far I have 
come.&quot;

	The total distance that Katsuragi Forest covered over the Osaka 
prefecture was around three miles. Judging by how dense the trees were 
to each other in the forest at this point around the clearing, Kasumi 
had made it to the very seat of the woodland If the shinobi that had 
been sent out after her this morning were just a part of a larger squad 
then they would likely be moving for her soon. Perhaps that made the 
idea of setting up a campfire in the middle of a forest clearing seem... 
well... stupid. Judging by the clothing of the shinobi this morning; 
they had been sent by Genra of the Mugen Tenshin Hajin-mon. They were 
known for their tracking skills. But at this point Kasumi&#39;s mind was too 
wistful to think of concealing her presence. There was little difference 
in either case. And so far so good. 

Or so she thought.

	While Kasumi lingered on the ground, she shut her eyes and tried 
to get some sleep. Once her eyes closed her main point of sense now 
became her ears. In the background she heard the distant squawk of the 
birds, the rustling of the leaves in the wind and the crackling embers 
of her fire. But one of her golden-brown eyes opened when she heard a 
sound that was not expected. The sound of the bushes begin disturbed 
Then her whole body reacted when she heard the sound of travelling 
metal. Kasumi scowled and urgently rolled to her left. A kunai knife 
shot from the north bush and spiked the soil around the fire. The teen 
woman looked to the bush and vaulted up into a stand, switching her 
hands into a fighting pose. The bush was still. Kasumi stared hard with 
confusion. Until she once more heard a sound. The sound of wind 
resistance against a body. And quite a nimble one. Kasumi didn&#39;t even 
have to look up to realize that something was coming down from above. 
She skidded to the right of the fire and out of the way. A shadowed 
figure landed where Kasumi had once stood, that person&#39;s fist stomping 
the ground beneath with a forceful punch. 

&quot;The Art of Misdirection,&quot; Her eyes latched on to the whom had used it, 
&quot;Ayane!&quot;

	Ayane spread a dark grin across her beautiful face and stood 
upright, withdrawing her fingertips from the inch-deep fist print her 
punch had left in the earth. &quot;The rabbit won&#39;t stop running, huh? What 
more should I expect from YOU of all people. You&#39;re such a goddamned 
coward.&quot;

&quot;Ayane...&quot; Kasumi said softly, catching her breath.

The lilac-haired kunoichi pressed her palm against her hip. &quot;You know, 
don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot; Ayane didn&#39;t have to clarify that for Kasumi to know the 
meaning. God forbid that semantics ever play a part in a conversation 
between the two, &quot;he&#39;s taken his rightful place as leader. I knew that 
he would. I was expecting it... from the day... he recovered his 
memories. After Project Epsilon...&quot;

Ayane grimaced. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna hear it. It&#39;s not like you had anything 
to do with it. Those bastards might have delayed things but it&#39;s 
business as usual. I&#39;m going to destroy you... once and for all&quot;

Kasumi tightened her fighting stance. &quot;Is this why the Hajin-mon are 
after me rather than the Tenjin-mon?&quot;

	Neither Kasumi nor Ayane had a solid answer to that query. And 
neither of them wanted to bring themselves to fully question the cause 
or the meaning. But there was a similar suspicion in their minds, one 
with opposite results to either girl. It brought some small comfort to 
Kasumi but only served to anger Ayane further. The Woman Tengu 
transformed her grin to a frown and clutched both of her fists together. 
She swiftly jumped backwards to put some distance between herself and 
Kasumi. The brown-haired woman saw that and kicked at something on the 
ground beneath her. A wire. When that was kicked and the wire was 
disturbed, its almost invisibly small size was reflected in the 
moonlight. It wove around the trees surrounding the dell and pulled at 
something hidden in the darkness between two trees directly adjacent 
from Ayane More than fifteen kunai knives were thrown from the blackness 
of the shadows and thrown in the Hajin-mon successor&#39;s direction. Ayane 
scowled at that and made the two-fingered sign. 

	The army of flying kunai struck her repeatedly in the air. 
Outwardly. Seconds later the &#39;wounded&#39; form of Ayane reverted into a 
one-branched log of wood. Kasumi blinked; and in her urgency, realized 
that her short sword was gone A moment afterwards Ayane was right behind 
her with Kasumi&#39;s short sword in her hand. She yelled a battle cry and 
thrust the metal weapon straight into her target&#39;s back. 

&quot;You&#39;re so cocky,&quot; Ayane bragged, closing her eyes with a smirk, &quot;D&#39;you 
really think I&#39;m stupid enough to fall for your tricks? I knew you&#39;d 
defend yourself with some kind of shitty little trap when you got here.&quot;

A familiar voice replied to that from behind Ayane&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m 
cocky?&quot;

	Ayane gasped and opened her eyes once again. And when she did she 
saw that another log was skewered on the end of Kasumi&#39;s blade. Not 
Kasumi herself. Then Kasumi acted and thrust her leg straight into her 
rival&#39;s back. Ayane grunted and stumbled forwards from the kick, 
scuttling around until she and the runaway were face to face. &quot;Ugh!&quot;

Kasumi stared blankly at the Hajin-mon kunoichi. &quot;When will this end?&quot;

&quot;Pleading for your life?&quot; Ayane remarked, &quot;Cheap shots still don&#39;t come 
for free after all.&quot;

&quot;Answer my question.&quot;

	Ayane growled at that and charged straight for Kasumi. Though she 
was clad only in her underwear, Kasumi was more than ready to fight 
back. A swing of the hips came with an extension of the leg from Ayane. 
And Kasumi pulled up her arms. The &#39;whap&#39; of a clothed leg meeting dead 
with bare arms was heard. Kasumi replied by crouching down and whipping 
her right leg around the ground. Ayane hopped over the 180 degree sweep 
and moved across. Leading in with her knee she attempted to hit Kasumi 
at that point. The runaway ninja crouched down fully to avoid the attack 
and rolled forwards underneath her. The two of them alternated positions 
and turned back around to face each other. Then they charged each other 
at the same time. Kasumi and Ayane kicked in unison at each other. The 
legs met together and deflected with a clap of force. They both turned 
around with identical moves and thrust one of their fists at the other. 
The punch of the lilac-haired woman met with that of the auburn-haired 
one, producing another beat of force. Ayane narrowed her eyes and 
attempted another kick. Kasumi blocked it with her right arm and wrist. 
Then she herself tried a punch. As fast as it was Ayane caught it long 
before it landed They scrambled away from each other and then attacked 
once more. Ayane lunged for Kasumi leading by the hand. Kasumi tilted 
her nubile body back and grabbed Ayane by the shoulders. She dragged the 
slightly younger girl down with her for a moment Then Kasumi rolled back 
and kicked into Ayane&#39;s stomach, launching her diagonally into the air 
with a potent rolling throw, which finally caused Ayane to drop her 
sword. The Woman Tengu scowled and rotated her body mid-air. She then 
span herself around and pressed her feet against the bark of the tree 
trunk she had been thrown at with the momentum. Then she used that same 
momentum to launch herself back at Kasumi like a human bullet. Once 
again Ayane rotated herself so that she led in with her feet. Kasumi 
yelled out and the pupil of Genra struck her hard with a double-kick. It 
was so strong that Kasumi skidded back from the pressure. 
	Ayane then landed and Kasumi paused. Both of them caught their 
breaths and studied the other. It was a draw so far. It was no secret 
that the two half-sisters were almost evenly matched. Kasumi had often 
been proclaimed to be the better skilled kunoichi And despite her 
fragile heart, she was. But the difference between them was so small 
that it was almost irrelevant.

Almost

There was no mistaking the fact that Ayane had won no victories over 
Kasumi, in either training or fully-fledged combat in the past. So 
spoken by the burning jealousy (or at least what seemed to be jealousy) 
mirrored in Ayane&#39;s gleaming crimson eyes. Kasumi&#39;s ample chest heaved 
up and down against her bra while she caught her breath, and she spoke 
softly, maintaining her fighting stance.  

&quot;Why do... you pursue me?&quot; Kasumi questioned, &quot;Why... must we do this 
again?&quot;

Ayane regained her smile. &quot;For God&#39;s sake, is running away your 
knee-jerk reaction to any kind of crisis?&quot;

&quot;Why, Ayane? Why? Why must we do this when you know it means nothing? I 
know what I am and what I did and I refuse to apologize for it. I only 
did what I thought was right.&quot;

&quot;Oh, spare me your bullshit!&quot; The younger one replied, &quot;You&#39;re a 
fugitive, too scared to accept her duties!&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you have done the same if something like that had happened to 
Genra?&quot; Kasumi asked.

Ayane&#39;s shoulders jerked at that. A brief look of realization crossed 
her face. But it was replaced by another hateful, angered smile. &quot;Don&#39;t 
you DARE speak his name! As far as I&#39;m concerned you&#39;re nothing but a 
worthless coward, Kasumi!&quot;

Kasumi steeled her will. &quot;Then why? If I&#39;m worthless as you say then why 
even bother with me?!&quot;

There was a moment of confusion and indecision at that point. It then 
became a pause before action. Ayane scowled once more and jumped from 
her point, pouncing forwards. But this time Kasumi was in no mood to 
entertain the possibilities. This time she truly wanted an answer and 
she would go out of her way to get one before the night was through. 
Ayane thrust a punch her way. Kasumi paced herself and then grabbed the 
wrist of that incoming arm. The caster growled femininely and followed 
up with a second from her free right hand. Kasumi caught that punch 
dead-on and held Ayane firm. The younger one gasped and struggled to get 
free, doing her best not to meet eyes with Kasumi. And Kasumi herself 
took the initiative. She pushed her weight down and forced Ayane to the 
ground. When the Hajin-mon ninja&#39;s back slapped against the grassy 
ground she found herself pinned down by the wrists, with Kasumi 
straddling her waist. A contest of strength ensued from that point, with 
Ayane unable to break Kasumi&#39;s grip and Kasumi struggling to keep the 
grip in application over Ayane. Eventually the two extra pounds worth of 
weight that Kasumi had over Ayane prevailed. 

Now Ayane was forced to look in Kasumi&#39;s eyes. Forced to see the sadness 
and seriousness that existed within them. There was no avoiding it like 
this. Kasumi spoke once Ayane stopped struggling. &quot;Just tell me, Ayane. 
Even if you hate me... just... tell me the truth.&quot;

The answer existed as a ghost. A ghost that had been chasing her just as 
much as she chased Kasumi. She had been fighting it ever since the 
Tenjin-mon and the Hajin-mon had been forced to display the talents of 
their finest progeny to each other at the behest of the elders. Those 
days of childhood seemed too far away from this moment Who could 
remember such things in a delusional world still reeling from the many 
revelations of the Tengu and the games of the Superhuman Development 
Project? But Ayane could. Her life as an assassin could never conceal 
what those times meant to her. When she looked back to those times she 
could clearly remember three faces Two of them being Hayate and Genra. 
The other was Kasumi. The rivalry Ayane had with her had been long and 
arduous, ever since they were first introduced. There was only one 
reason behind it. One that they both knew and felt...

...and yet...

...Kasumi was too scared to admit to it. And Ayane was too proud to do 
so.

Ayane jerked her face to the side and frowned. A moment later a tear 
dropped on her cheek Ayane&#39;s eyes widened at the salty wetness dotted on 
her cheek, which was momentarily followed by three more. She looked up 
and saw those tears of Kasumi for herself. And finally noticed how much 
Kasumi was trembling. 

&quot;Do you hate me that much...?&quot; Kasumi whispered solemnly, &quot;...Am I so... 
abhorrent...?&quot;

The Woman Tengu&#39;s throat quivered. And she noticed a sudden quickening 
of the beats of her heart. As well as a abrupt twinkle of butterflies in 
her stomach. Seeing Kasumi smile was enough to make her retch. Yet 
seeing her tears had a completely opposite effect. Conjuring emotions 
and feelings she thought she had buried years ago. And Ayane now felt 
them once again when Kasumi&#39;s tears trickled down the curve of her 
cheek. She looked up again at her. She saw the frailty and insecurity in 
Kasumi&#39;s golden brown eyes. It stunned her to no end that someone so 
emotionally unstable could ever be a better kunoichi than herself. But 
the part of Ayane that looked beyond all that, the part of her that 
wasn&#39;t willing to lie to herself, was simply drawn in by it. And thus 
she acted of no more than her feelings. Ayane suddenly reached out and 
placed her hand against Kasumi&#39;s soft cheek, possessively, verging on 
tenderly.

Kasumi blinked at the sudden touch. &quot;A-Ayane...?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t talk.&quot;

If the caress wasn&#39;t abrupt enough then the kiss that followed it 
certainly was So much so that Kasumi barely even knew what was happening 
until it occurred. Ayane leaned upwards and pressed her lips against 
those of the former Mugen Tenshin Tenjin-mon ninja. Kasumi cried out a 
muffled gasp which melted into a startled moan. Despite the situation a 
kiss was the last thing she had been expecting. Yet all the same she 
made no attempt to stop it. With all her ninja-honed skills, Kasumi&#39;s 
body was certainly capable of it. And even so that same body was 
betraying her. Or rather the Id of the mind was -- the superego falling 
to the one great weakness of mankind, the will to pleasure. 
	Kasumi sighed delicately -- a sigh that transformed into a 
whimper, her lips claimed and prised open by Ayane&#39;s. Her eyes closed in 
the moment. And she was more than startled to hear herself moan into 
Ayane&#39;s warm mouth... the beginning of the thing she would have wanted 
to avoid most of all. The beginning of that bittersweet mantra -- of 
flesh meeting with flesh -- the appraisal of a relationship so pointless 
and yet so magnetic. 

Why are moths drawn to the flame?

Why does the heart exist?

Why is the mind so susceptible to the heart with regards to the 
pleasures of the flesh? 

Propagation? 

Sustenance?

Relief?

Why itself is an answer needed?

	Truth lies in the fact that there is no truth. There is no 
teleology to the heart and to the emotions it brings. To the one mindful 
of the double standard -- it is a fallacy. To the one mindful of 
themselves comes the uncomplicated riddle; existence exists to exist. To 
Kasumi and Ayane, now, there is no meaning. The lifetimes of suffering 
ahead mean nothing to this one moment of duality, between happiness and 
sadness. It is not on Earth as it is in Heaven; for there is no 
&#39;Heaven&#39;. Only this...

...that which is the moment.

Perhaps that is why neither of them understood just how bleak this road 
will be.

Kaiser&#39;s Afterthoughts

* This is the first fanfiction I&#39;ve written in nearly half a year. I was 
originally going to make this a simple one-shot lemon, but after 
proof-reading it I decided that I&#39;d extend it a little so it could pan 
out at a similar length to one of my older Kasumi and Ayane stories; 
Heartbreaker. It should run for about three chapters -- possibly more 
considering how open-ended I see this story being right now.

* This fic takes place between Dead or Alive 2 and 3. I haven&#39;t played 
Dead or Alive 4 yet, so if there is something in here that contradicts 
the current canon (beyond the fact that Kasumi and Ayane aren&#39;t actually 
attracted to each other) then feel free to point it out and I&#39;ll try to 
amend it. 

* The last 130 words of this fiction may have confused you a little. 
I&#39;ve been reading a lot of Friedrich Nietzsche recently; someone who&#39;s 
read his books may understand where I&#39;m coming from with this. If you 
don&#39;t, just take it as my way of saying that people don&#39;t need to ask 
why they do stupid things (like embarking on relationships with people 
they know to be wrong for them) in terms of how they feel. 

* The battle scenes in this chapter were heavily inspired by the Naruto 
series. Pretty obvious, huh?
