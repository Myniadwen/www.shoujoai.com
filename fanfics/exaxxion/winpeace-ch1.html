<h1>Winning the Peace</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../exaxxion/index.html">Cannon God Exaxxion</a>

<pre>War is Over

In the end the war between the Riofaldians and Earth ended not with a 
bang but a long, drawn out whimper. The human controlled Exaxxion 
intercepted the fleet of Riofaldian ships warping in and decimated them, 
sending a clear message that this Solar System was a dangerous place for 
them. Back on Earth the Riofaldian troops surrendered, realizing that 
even with their advanced technology they couldn&#39;t hold out long without 
resupply.

However, that left Earth with the problem of what to DO with the 
survivors, as well as the relatively innocent colonists who settled on 
Earth without knowing of the coming conquest... The military officers 
who participated in criminal acts were tried, while others who laid down 
their arms and the colonists were given two choices. Either they could 
settle in a reserve, separate from humanity or attempt to integrate, 
taking all the risks involved.

Second lieutenant Fiot&#39;ts, now simply Officer Fiot&#39;ts of the united 
police, hurried to her position as explosions rattled the building and 
disturbed the night. &quot;Sir,&quot; she used her suit&#39;s built in mic to ask, 
&quot;what is it this time?&quot;

&quot;Human terrorists,&quot; Alex replied, her commander and a former human 
colonel, &quot;making trouble for innocent &#39;Fauldies. We need to shut them 
down as soon as we can.&quot;

&quot;Innocent,&#39; Fiot&#39;ts thought to herself as she adjusted her light power 
suit, took position and drew her pistol, &#39;I&#39;m not sure that word even 
applies to my people.&#39;

The Riofaldian people were an expansionist militaristic race, and had 
been for as long as anyone could remember. To support their standard of 
living at home they took over other worlds and plundered their 
resources, wisely choosing worlds that were well behind them 
technologically speaking. After a peaceful first contact they would 
cooperate with a native species to build a space elevator, supposedly to 
open them to interstellar trade. Instead the elevator would be the tool 
of their destruction, unleashing the giant battle machines that the 
Riofaldians used to take over world upon world.

On cue Fiot&#39;ts broke from cover, silently leading her team of three into 
the warren that was the docks near what was once the space elevator. 
Wrecked in the war it was a looming shadow, one doomed to be 
disassembled when the time was right. Through the dim light Fiot&#39;ts 
moved forward slowly, the sensors in her suit picking up movement up 
ahead.

&quot;Damn &#39;Faldie bitch,&quot; a man hissed as they heard a blow being struck, 
&quot;think we&#39;d just forgive and forget?! Your people made us cannibals with 
your fake relief supplies! You aren&#39;t anywhere near done paying for 
that!&quot;

Fiot&#39;ts winced. The Riofaldians lacked the taboos of their Earth hosts, 
and at least in her case had been unaware of the reaction they would 
cause among humans. &#39;Another error of our commanders,&#39; she thought 
bleakly. Gesturing to her team she said, &quot;We have to move, they&#39;re going 
to either rape or kill her.&quot;

Together they hurried up the hall into a open area, seeing three men 
pinning a pale Riofaldian woman while another stood watch, gun drawn. 
&quot;Move away from the woman and throw down your arms!&quot; her subordinate 
yelled, weapon ready.

The standing man fired and Fiot&#39;ts cursed softly, her short hair falling 
into her eyes as she shot back, the projectile tearing into his arm. As 
they saw their friend be hurt the men holding the Riofaldian woman down 
leapt away from her as if she was on fire, looking around them 
desperately for a escape.

&quot;Surrender now,&quot; Fiot&#39;ts pitched her voice as commandingly as she could, 
&quot;or suffer the consequences.&quot;

The man with a gun cast it away as her team rounded them up, binding 
their hands as they walked by Fiot&#39;ts. &quot;Damn &#39;Fauldie,&quot; one man muttered 
as he passed by, spitting at her.

One of her men moved to punch him but Fiot&#39;ts raised a hand to stop him. 
&quot;Let it go,&quot; she ordered softly, &quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; her second in command dragged the man off even as Fiot&#39;ts 
walked over to the injured woman.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you kill them?&quot; the wounded Riofaldian woman demanded, her 
blonde hair shining against her pale skin, tears glistening on her 
cheeks.

Fiot&#39;ts offered her a hand up, mentally commanding the nanowear in her 
dunsuit to form a rough gown for her. &quot;If we just kill,&quot; she finally 
said quietly, &quot;things will never change.&quot;

The Riofaldian woman looked at her blankly as they walked then began to 
sob quietly. &quot;I want to go home,&quot; she managed to choke out, &quot;away from 
this human madness!&quot;

&#39;Home is something either of us may never see,&#39; Fiot&#39;ts thought to 
herself tiredly.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;Welcome home,&quot; hearing the door open Aoi Hino called out as she checked 
over dinner. While the meal was basically pre-made it did need to be 
properly heated... and to be honest Aoi was a bit superstitious that 
way.

Fiot&#39;ts took off the glove containing the core nanotech for her light 
armor and set it down on the table, then the pale skinned and rose 
haired woman smiled tiredly, &quot;Hello, love.&quot;

&quot;Long day?&quot; Aoi asked her, the redish brown haired woman gently pulling 
her into a loving embrace.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Fiot&#39;ts sighed happily as she relaxed a bit in Aoi&#39;s embrace. 
&quot;Attempted assault,&quot; she sighed, &quot;those are always hard.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Aoi nodded, her gaze far more understanding than most humans 
might have been. &quot;Ley me get you a drink,&quot; she smiled, &quot;and we&#39;ll talk 
about it...&quot;

Aoi Hino was a unusual woman, her family having been yanked right into 
the cusp of the war. Her little sister Akane had fallen in love with the 
pilot of the earth mecha Exaxxion, Hoichi &#39;Gun&#39; Kano, and the whole 
family had been declared enemies of the Riofaldian forces. She survived 
being taken hostage at the space elevator, an attack on the elevator and 
was eventually rescued by the infamous Gun. Not only that, she had been 
at ground zero when the first treaties between the colonist and humans 
were made.

They talked a bit, Aoi soothing Fiot&#39;ts while also talking about her 
work as a reporter, both of them soon chuckling at a goof up her fellow 
broadcaster had made. &quot;It&#39;s days like this,&quot; Fiot&#39;ts murmured, &quot;that I&#39;m 
glad you approached me.&quot;

Sitting beside her on the couch Aoi chuckled softly, &quot;Then I&#39;m glad I 
picked you to interview back then.&quot; She looked thoughtful, &quot;I think it 
was when you talked about your friend Shishi&#39;a that I realized we might 
be similarly inclined.&quot;

Fiot&#39;ts blushed faintly, &quot;That obvious, hmm?&quot; She looked off into the 
distance, &quot;Shishi&#39;a... was my first crush, really. She never knew I was 
alive.&quot;

Aoi reached out and hugged her, well aware of how delicate a Riofaldan 
could be. &quot;I was so sorry for your loss,&quot; she said softly, &quot;and I could 
hear your anger too.&quot;

She nodded slightly as Fiot&#39;ts said, &quot;The general she sacrificed herself 
to save? He didn&#39;t care. Her cries as she died were just a distraction 
for him.&quot; Fiot&#39;ts&#39; eyes shimmered with remembered pain and grief, &quot;He 
never even went to pay his respects later.&quot;

Tenderly Aoi stroked her head, hugging her as she said, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Fiot&#39;ts smiled weakly, &quot;it&#39;s all right.&quot; She looked up into Aoi&#39;s 
brown eyes, &quot;If I hadn&#39;t discovered how I felt with her, I might never 
have found you.&quot; Gracefully she pressed her lips to Aoi&#39;s, traces of 
salt from her tears still lingering on her lips.

Aoi slid back as the kiss deepened, both of them sampling the alien yet 
familiar taste of the other&#39;s skin. She slid her arms around Fiot&#39;ts as 
she nibbled her neck, stroking her back and sliding her hand down to her 
skirt covered bottom.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Fiot&#39;ts purred softly as she swiftly undid buttons on Aoi&#39;s 
shirt, revealing a white bra and silky skin.

&quot;If you like,&quot; Aoi purred in Fiot&#39;ts&#39; ear, &quot;you can imagine I&#39;m 
Shishi&#39;a,.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m happier,&quot; Fiot&#39;ts nibbled gently on the skin above her bra, &quot;here 
with you.&quot;

&quot;You say the sweetest things,&quot; Aoi chuckled as she unclipped her bra.

Fiot&#39;ts smiled as she scooted up to kiss her wife. &quot;Loving you,&quot; she 
looked tenderly into Aoi&#39;s eyes, &quot;makes it easy.&quot; Then she kissed her 
once again before moving on to certain more... intimate areas.

End

Notes: Fiot&#39;ts is her LAST name, but for the life of me I can&#39;t find her 
first name in the mangas I have. lol Her response to Shishi&#39;a&#39;s death is 
just as I mentioned, though she is mostly just a background character in 
Exaxxion. Aoi Hino is also mostly a background character, and has almost 
no fleshing out. So I decided to do a bit here... lol</pre>
