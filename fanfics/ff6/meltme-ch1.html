<h1>Melt Into Me (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff6/index.html">Final Fantasy  6</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sduchess.html">Snow Duchess</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Everyone was arguing. What about, I had no idea. Something political. 
All I knew is it hurt my head. Rubbing my temples, I fought to keep 
their words from blending together. A hand landed on my shoulder, and I 
looked up to see Celes mutely watching the debate. I guess she was wise 
to stay out of it.

In an effort to block out the growing headache, I focused on the blonde. 
I had this nagging feeling that I knew her from somewhere, but I just 
couldn&#39;t remember. She seemed to know me, but maybe that&#39;s because she 
was a general of the Empire.

I had to keep reminding myself of that. The others certainly weren&#39;t 
happy when Locke showed up with her in tow. I think Cyan called her a 
butcher, and I noticed she didn&#39;t even tense a muscle, almost like she 
was expecting it. It was strange to me; she didn&#39;t seem like a bad 
person. As soon as Cyan&#39;s anger was directed towards me, though, her 
sword was at his throat before I could blink. Odd that she&#39;d be the one 
to defend me.

Tearing my gaze away from her, I returned my attention to the Returners 
and the Narshe gentry.

&quot;Narshe is neutral!&quot; The elder cried. &quot;And now we&#39;re about to be invaded 
because of some frozen mythical beast we didn&#39;t know we had.&quot; He 
gestured in my direction. &quot;This girl being here again isn&#39;t making 
matters better, either.&quot;

Banon pinched the bridge of his nose. &quot;And what do you suggest we do?&quot;

&quot;Hand the girl over to the Imperials!&quot;

Celes perked up. &quot;Over my cold and rotting corpse.&quot;

&quot;That can be arranged,&quot; Cyan growled, half drawing his katana.

&quot;Oh, stay your blade, Garamonde, before I stay it for you,&quot; Celes 
snapped.

&quot;Give them the general, too!&quot; the elder added. &quot;Maybe it would appease 
them.&quot;

Celes took a breath to speak what would probably be considered too foul 
to come from a lady&#39;s lips, but she quickly shut her mouth with an 
audible click of her teeth. She started again, calmer. &quot;Fine. You don&#39;t 
want my help?&quot; She picked up her sheathed sword off the table and 
started walking to the door. &quot;I&#39;m gone.&quot;

The elder recoiled a full step back as Celes passed in front of him. 
Obviously there was more to her demeanor than I was aware of. Not that 
it mattered to me, because I didn&#39;t want this woman to leave.

&quot;Where will you go?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Anywhere but here.&quot; Stopping short of the door, she turned towards me. 
&quot;Come with me.&quot;

I really wasn&#39;t expecting such an innocent request. Or maybe it was a 
question. She almost sounded...I don&#39;t know...hopeful?

As if realizing that very fact from the confusion written on my face, 
her defenses went back up, and she quickly backtracked. &quot;Forget it.&quot;

She was out the door before I could respond. Cyan grunted in approval, 
while Locke just rubbed his forehead.

Edgar sighed. A beat of silence passed. &quot;Locke...&quot;

&quot;I know, I&#39;ll bring her back.&quot;

He, too, disappeared through the door. I hoped he could convince her to 
stay. Even if I couldn&#39;t grasp whatever memories I may have of her, I 
did sense a kindred spirit in her. For the first time, I didn&#39;t feel so 
alone in the world.
