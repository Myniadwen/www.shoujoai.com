<h1>Melt Into Me (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff6/index.html">Final Fantasy  6</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sduchess.html">Snow Duchess</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff6/meltme-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>We failed. Over a year had passed, and that was still the only thing I 
could grasp. We couldn&#39;t stop him. We could only stand back and gawk, 
immobilized as Gestahl spouted out words of corruption and greed. I was 
forced to watch as even Celes&#39; steadfastness and loyalty were tested 
against the enticing power of the Three Goddesses, an internal conflict 
of honor and self-preservation.

I had watched as she met my gaze, refusing the tempting promises and 
seductive power offered her before running Kefka through with her sword.

I had listened as Kefka laughed and batted her aside, calling on the 
Goddesses to heed his call.

I had cringed when Gestahl was struck down and sent plummeting to the 
world below.

I had whimpered as Kefka doomed the world.

Almost fourteen months since The Ruin had passed, and still I dreamt it 
every night, every morning waking up to my own scream as I fell from the 
Blackjack&#39;s splintered deck.

The end of the world, and I survived, lived on to watch its slow decay.

Kefka&#39;s Light of Judgment had left Mobliz in ruins. Duane and Katarin, 
barely eighteen, were the only other adults, with about a dozen small 
children under their care. I had to wonder if the rest of the world had 
suffered like that as well. I thought about my friends and if any of 
them had survived the fall.

On the outskirts of Mobliz, I stood at the water&#39;s edge, deep in 
thought. It had become my customary place of solitude, where my &#39;family&#39; 
knew I wasn&#39;t to be bothered. Of course, when I felt a familiar cold 
presence step up beside me, I couldn&#39;t help but smile. Without even 
glancing at her, I made my greeting.

&quot;I should have known you would survive.&quot;

&quot;Takes more than global annihilation to kill me.&quot; I could tell she was 
also smiling even before she turned to me. &quot;How are you, Ter?&quot;

I kept my gaze on the water as I answered. &quot;Alive.&quot;

She turned her eyes back to the horizon. &quot;I know the feeling.&quot;

Hearing a note of melancholy in her voice, I finally turned to her. To 
the casual observer, it would have appeared she was relaxed. I knew her 
better than that, of course, and saw that just beneath her serene 
expression lay a nameless turmoil. Studying her profile, it looked as 
though she had grown more than just a year older. I wondered what 
unspeakable horrors had made this once young and vibrant woman age far 
beyond her twenty years. I suppose more than anything, she looked tired.

&quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Some things are best left buried.&quot;

She said it as though it brimmed with irony. I took a breath to press 
but instead let it out in a bittersweet laugh. &quot;You&#39;re never going to 
let me in, are you?&quot; I dropped my gaze back to the water. &quot;Every time I 
think I&#39;m getting close, you put your armor back on.&quot;

Celes shook her head. &quot;You melted my armor, Ter. I don&#39;t have any left.&quot;

I glanced at her thoughtfully. &quot;Is that why you keep me at arm&#39;s 
length?&quot;

She turned to me in surprise. &quot;What? Terra, I don&#39;t-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s like you&#39;re afraid I&#39;m going to burn you.&quot;

She looked away, no longer attempting denial. &quot;I missed you, Ter.&quot;

My smile returned at the admission. When I pulled her into a soft hug, I 
was happy to find that she returned it. I began to let go, but by some 
foreign and repressed reflex, I leaned closer, nearly pressing my lips 
to hers. Only when she withdrew slightly in surprise did I realize what 
I was doing.

Letting my arms slip away from her neck, I cleared my throat and took a 
couple awkward steps back. I then gave a nervous chuckle, and when I 
mustered enough courage to look in her eyes again, the blue orbs glinted 
with amusement. Damn her. Leave it to Celes to find humor in my 
humiliation.

I cleared my throat again, pretending I didn&#39;t notice how hot my face 
felt. &quot;You&#39;re, um, welcome to stay for as long as you want.&quot;

The corner of her mouth quirked up for a fraction of a second before a 
faint sadness took over again. &quot;I can stay for a while.&quot;

And again I could only watch as her &#39;melted&#39; armor froze and snapped 
right back into place.
