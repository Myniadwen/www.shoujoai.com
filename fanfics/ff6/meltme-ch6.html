<h1>Melt Into Me (part 6 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff6/index.html">Final Fantasy  6</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sduchess.html">Snow Duchess</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff6/meltme-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The good guys prevailed. I had no idea trisecting a god could be so 
fulfilling, but when I watched Kefka topple over from the damage my Atma 
Weapon and Celes&#39; Illumina inflicted, I very nearly burst into song.

Edgar must have read my mind. &quot;Ding dong, the clown is dead,&quot; he 
announced with great satisfaction.

I chuckled as the guys all shared a good cheer at that. The feeling of 
exhilaration soon passed, though, and the world began to crumble.

I remember feeling faint as I watched Relm and Strago rub their heads in 
pain, I remember Celes clutching her chest and collapsing to the ground 
in convulsions. I remember Locke dropping down with her, taking the 
brunt of her seizure to keep her from hurting herself and whispering 
soothing words to quiet her screams of agony. I remember wondering why 
she was the one suffering while I stood unscathed. I remember a blinding 
pain and the coming darkness.

I&#39;m not really sure what happened after that.

When the darkness receded, I found myself half-lying half-sitting on the 
deck of the Falcon, Celes&#39; arms around me protectively. I knew the 
others all stood worriedly around us, but even as I stirred, her hold 
didn&#39;t loosen. The first conscious thought I had was that we had 
survived.

My next conscious thought was the realization that it was gone. My 
magic, my Esper half, my father&#39;s heritage: gone. Only a gaping hole 
remained in its wake. With that knowledge, tears coursed down my face 
unbidden, and I was grateful for my friends&#39; silence.

I looked back over my shoulder at Celes, searching for any wisdom she 
had to guide me through this. The hollowness of her expression, though, 
told me she was just as lost as I was. To see such a look in her eyes 
was more than I could bear, and I cried harder. I think that roused her 
from her trance because she suddenly looked at me in concern.

&quot;Ter?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s gone,&quot; I breathed. &quot;It&#39;s really gone.&quot;

&quot;But we&#39;re not.&quot; She cracked a tiny grin. &quot;Told you we&#39;d get through 
this.&quot;

I tried to mirror her smile. I knew she was just hiding the pain and 
emptiness, but I had never welcomed that mask as I did at that moment. I 
guess the sweetness of lies was sometimes easier to face than the cold 
truth.

Our return to Figaro heralded the start of the largest celebration in 
centuries. Food, drink, and dancing was accompanied by the guys regaling 
the other guests with heroic stories of the war, from trying to bury 
Kefka under Figaro and feasting with the emperor to fighting a giant 
purple octopus. I chuckled quietly when Locke received a sharp punch in 
the arm for spilling the beans about Celes&#39; little opera escapade. Of 
course, it was about this time people started realizing she was in fact 
the former Imperial general, and Celes soon found herself surrounded by 
curious patrons, bombarded by questions. As uncomfortable as I knew she 
was, her skills of diplomacy never faltered.

Many inquired as the where the &#39;heroes&#39; would go after the festivities 
died down. Edgar&#39;s answer was obvious as he was the king of Figaro. 
Sabin had decided to remain the in kingdom for at least a little while 
before returning to the monk lifestyle. Locke, ever the adventurous 
wanderer, wanted to resume his travels of the world in search of rare 
relics and fabled treasures. Setzer would continue to be master of the 
skies in all of his glorified freedom. Cyan had plans to rebuild his 
fallen kingdom and seemed to have taken Gau under his wing. Strago 
wanted to return home to Thamasa, and Relm intended on applying to art 
academies across the world. Mog and Umaro longed for the familiar 
snowcaps of Narshe where the rest of the moogle population almost 
certainly were still hiding. Shadow and Gogo were both notably absent, 
having shied away from the large throng of people.

I smiled to myself when I noticed Celes, too, slipped away. Taking one 
last sip of my champagne, I set the glass down and made my own stealthy 
exit. Wanting fresh air, I retreated up the stairs of Figaro&#39;s central 
observation tower. As I had expected, Celes was already there, elbows 
resting on the stone rail as she stared out over the desert. Welcoming 
the cool breeze, I took a similar position next to her. Neither of us 
said anything for a while. We didn&#39;t have to. We simply enjoyed the 
night air.

When I finally asked her where she was thinking of going, she gave a 
small shrug. The tiny cryptic smile on her face told me she was finally 
feeling free of her past, like a bird released from its cage into the 
boundless sky. I got the feeling she would travel the world with Locke 
merely for the sake of traveling. I suppressed the twinge of jealousy at 
the thought because I knew that was just how she was. She wasn&#39;t the 
type to settle down and live a quiet life. Not yet. That was okay, 
though. I could wait.

Of its own volition, my hand crept over to hers and gave a light 
squeeze. Celes looked thoughtfully at our linked hands for moment before 
turning her gaze to me. Shifting so that she faced me, she gave my hand 
a gentle tug and pulled me into a soft kiss. In just that one kiss, I 
could sense the snow beginning to melt in the wake of our magic&#39;s death.

I knew it would take time for her; a glacier doesn&#39;t thaw overnight. 
Time, though, was something I finally knew I had. I would go back to 
Mobliz, of course, as I had promised I would. There wasn&#39;t a doubt in my 
mind that she would find me again, and that when she did, she would 
completely melt into me.
Six years later...

Though Mobliz was still a fraction of what the town it used to be, the 
restoration project Edgar was funding was coming steadily along. Most of 
the kids were becoming self-sufficient young adults, and a small number 
of immigrants had begun to trickle in.

As I stood in my spot at the water&#39;s edge, it was hard for me to believe 
six years had passed. I saw my friends at the annual reunion, of course, 
but I was otherwise secluded in the once shambled town. When I was 
working, time went by quickly, but it was moments like these, having a 
few minutes to myself, when I began to remember the past and grow a 
little too nostalgic.

With a bit of a sniffle, I was about to turn to go inside when someone 
came up beside me. A part of me wasn&#39;t surprised-a part of me was never 
surprised when it came to her-and I couldn&#39;t help but smile. Our fingers 
brushed against each other, entwined affectionately. Neither of us 
spoke, but neither of us ever had to.
