<h1>Melt Into Me (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff6/index.html">Final Fantasy  6</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sduchess.html">Snow Duchess</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff6/meltme-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>I had spent the last few months running scared from the Empire. To say 
the least, it wasn&#39;t comforting that we were being coerced into working 
with them. With a churning gut and Locke at my side, I followed our 
small Imperial escort to the docks of Albrook. There, a clean-cut 
officer awaited us.

&quot;Welcome, Mister Cole, Miss Branford,&quot; the man greeted with a polite 
bow. &quot;I am General Leo Cristophe. I hope to make this journey run as 
smoothly as possible.&quot;

Locke shrugged, unimpressed. &quot;So you&#39;re the one in charge, eh?&quot;

The corner of Leo&#39;s mouth twitched upward. &quot;As it were, I am accompanied 
by a fellow general. An officer you are quite familiar with, if I am not 
mistaken.&quot;

It was then I noticed her approach from behind Leo, in all her Imperial 
glory. I don&#39;t think I realized my jaw had dropped until I saw the same 
look on Locke. I also wasn&#39;t sure if Celes co-commanding our little 
mission was more comforting or less. The question of trust was not 
exactly a simple one, and it didn&#39;t help that she refused eye contact 
with either of us. She barely spoke a word and even then, it was to Leo.

The lady general&#39;s older counterpart seemed like a honorable man, but 
like with Celes, the Imperial uniform weighed heavily on my fear. I 
vaguely remembered Leo, another rarity that treated me decently. It came 
as no surprise that he and Celes had been (and probably still were) 
close. For the briefest moment, I found myself wondering if the two had 
ever been involved...

The ship set sail, and the day slowly passed. I noted with some sadness 
that Celes had only made an appearance in the common room of the lower 
deck to retrieve her dinner. The rest of the day, she remained in her 
private cabin. It wasn&#39;t until the following afternoon that she actually 
sat down at the table Leo occupied.

Finally, I walked over to her. &quot;Hi, Celes.&quot;

She didn&#39;t look up from her book. &quot;Terra.&quot;

&quot;How have you been?&quot; Celes raised a brow but neither met my gaze nor 
answered the question. I lowered my head, a bit discouraged. &quot;I heard 
what happened...&quot; Receiving a wary look, I cringed before continuing. 
&quot;The others figured you dead.&quot;

&quot;As you can see, I&#39;m not,&quot; came her cold reply.

I held back a sigh and tried one last time. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay.&quot;

I was met with silence. It seemed the very idea of friendly intentions 
turned to ice and shattered on the ground before the general. Tears 
stinging my eyes and blurring my vision, I retreated up the stairs to 
the upper deck. I clutched the rail as I stared into the waves below, 
letting the wind dry my cheeks. I think a full minute passed before the 
cabin door opened again. She came up behind me, standing so close I 
could feel her breath on my hair.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

The whisper sent shivers down my spine. Without a word, I turned and 
flung my arms around her neck, burying my face in the crook of her neck. 
I held her tight, but when she didn&#39;t return the embrace, I pulled back 
just enough to search her ice-blue eyes. So cold, and I didn&#39;t 
understand why.

&quot;What happened to you?&quot;

Her only response was to break from my gaze, but I could still see her 
struggling to hide her pain. I was starting to realize it would take 
more than I possessed to thaw her armor.
