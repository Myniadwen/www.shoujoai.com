fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hentaidye.html">Hentai-Dye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The second and third of each month were bittersweet days for Terra Branford.

In the past year since the defeat Kefka, Setzer had started on a path to 
being the wealthiest non-royal person on the planet. This was largely 
because as far as transportation was concerned, he had the complete and 
total monopoly. While there had been a few owners of airships besides him 
before the world had been changed, the destruction that was wrought by 
Kefka&#146;s insane powers had, in one way or another, brought an end to each 
airship in existence save the safely-hidden Falcon.

The first order of business for the world&#146;s nations and peoples now that 
Kefka was gone was to rebuild. Replant, reseed, reconstruct...revive their 
ways of life as best they could. And Setzer, having a spacious, fast, 
reliable, convenient, trans-oceanic vessel at his command with no one else 
to give competition, of course was making a fortune by charging modest fees 
for the transportation of goods, resources, and workers from one place to 
another each day. Basic metal for building, lumber, water, clothing, food, 
and so on, all were traded between towns thanks to Setzer. Edgar had his 
engineers busy constructing an airship for Figaro-use in particular, but it 
wouldn&#146;t be completed for at least a year yet.

Setzer had a busy schedule to keep, and each month from the first to the 
fifth his schedule mandated that he transport a great deal of raw materials 
mined from the caves of Narshe to Figaro Castle to be refined into useful 
commodities to be distributed to its towns and traded to other places. To 
pay for Narshe&#146;s resources, Figaro had Setzer bring back various resources 
of its own--some of the refined products made at the castle, teas, cloths, 
and various other useful domestic items from South Figaro, and lumber 
harvested by the newly-annexed town of Mobliz, which King Edgar had had 
rebuilt and repopulated. Because the amount of time needed to load the heavy 
wood inside the ship, Setzer found it easier and more relaxing to simply 
stop in Mobliz for the entire days of the second and third to take a quick 
rest, staying in the small town and visiting with Terra. His visits, though, 
usually weren&#146;t very long, for he usually just napped most of his time away 
there so he could be more focused during long hours of flight later.

Naturally, Narshe always made sure that a representative of the community 
accompanied Setzer to negotiate with King Edgar, and oversee the entire 
business. Since Mayor Cole was of course too busy with home affairs to make 
the trip, the most logical thing to do was to send his fianc&eacute;e, since she 
also was a friend of Edgar and Setzer.

So it was that every second and third of the month, Terra spent her days 
with her old friend Celes while Setzer rested.

One might wonder why spending time with a good friend would be a bittersweet 
experience. Well, on the one hand, few things in Terra&#146;s life gave her the 
pleasure that spending time with the former imperial general did. Indeed, 
Terra spent most of the rest of the month anticipating talking to Celes next 
month, planning things they could do together then. On the other hand, being 
with Celes reminded Terra every moment that the blonde warrior was engaged 
to Locke.

Terra was in love with Celes. She was not sure when it had started, but she 
had come to the realization during the first few months after Kefka&#146;s defeat 
and she found herself back in Mobliz again without her friends. Though she 
missed them all, Celes had constantly been in her mind. It was not like it 
had been during the year after the world was changed...Terra had had to come 
to grips with the belief that her friends were all dead then. Now, she was 
alone, but knew her friends...knew Celes...were out there and still alive.

Of course, Celes was with Locke, and loved him. And that was not going to 
change. Terra knew this in her mind, but she could not change her 
heart...Celes resided within it, and would not be forced out by any logic or 
reason.

Today was the second of the month, and Terra was expecting Setzer&#146;s airship 
to arrive right outside Mobliz any minute. As she set the table for two, 
knowing that Celes enjoyed having lunch off the airship if possible, Terra 
was struck, not by the first time, by how odd all was...two years ago she had 
wanted so badly to feel love, to know it and understand it so completely as 
others surely must. She had always thought that it was her own failing, not 
knowing it and understanding it...that it was perhaps lost to her like many of 
her memories, or perhaps that it was blocked from her because she was not 
fully human somehow. She had yearned so badly to know it...

And now...she had it in the children of Mobliz, who, though they now had been 
adopted by people who had moved here to Mobliz, still loved her as a mother 
and whom she loved back as her own. And she had it in her feelings for 
Celes. And she now knew...almost nothing more about it than before. It was 
funny in a way...that thing that she had wanted so much to understand she now 
knew could not really be known completely by anyone, only felt. She didn&#146;t 
understand how it worked...all she knew was that she felt it for others, and 
that it was a stronger feeling than she had ever known.

Terra smiled as she heard the familiar sounds of an airship passing 
overhead, then landing slowly. She finished setting the table and exited her 
home in time to see Setzer, Celes, and several workers coming to the 
entrance of Mobliz. Katarin and Duane, now the joint mayors of the town, 
were there already to greet them. Terra waited as Setzer and Celes went over 
the details of this latest visit&#146;s goals.

Once that was done, she stepped forward. &quot;Hello, Celes, hello, Setzer,&quot; she 
greeted, smiling warmly.

Celes smiled back. &quot;Hello, Terra, good to see you again.&quot;

Setzer nodded wearily. &quot;Hi, Terra...phew, sorry, I&#146;ve been flying for a while 
all over the place, so I&#146;m not much for chit-chat. I&#146;m going to go take a 
nap at the inn...I&#146;ll talk to you later, alright?&quot;

Terra nodded and watched the former gambler blearily make his way to the 
small building that served as an inn to the few travelers who happened by. 
She then turned to Celes and asked, &quot;Would you like to have lunch with me, 
Celes? I made a light meal for us.&quot;

Celes nodded gratefully. &quot;That would be good, Terra...Setzer&#146;s crew just isn&#146;t 
that good at cooking.&quot;

The two women entered Terra&#146;s house. Celes sat down at the table as her 
friend brought over a salad and two bowls of soup. Once both were seated and 
served, they began eating while cheerfully discussing one another&#146;s lives. 
The reconstruction of the cities of the world seemed to be coming along well 
if Mobliz and Narshe were to be taken as examples. Celes told Terra of how 
Locke, Mog, and Umaro were faring at Narshe these days, and how Edgar and 
Sabin seemed to be doing at Figaro. Terra told of how the residents of 
Mobliz were getting along. It was small talk...nothing more than pleasant 
conversation to pass time, with nothing large or important within it. After 
the horrific events they had witnessed and taken part in before, and after 
times where the life and death of countless people hung in the balance with 
every action they took...being able to talk about small things, about a quiet 
and peaceful life, was a wonderful blessing.

After a time, there was a lull in their conversation. As they both quietly 
ate, Terra timidly asked, &quot;Celes?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; the knight responded, eyes questioning.

Timidly, yet with complete sureness in every word, gaze never wavering from 
Celes&#146;s for a moment, Terra said, &quot;I love you, Celes.&quot;

There was silence. Terra waited, her soft eyes trying to penetrate Celes&#146;s. 
Celes sat motionless, expressionless, yet never looking away.

&quot;You...love me.&quot; It was not a question...yet not a confirmation. It was perhaps 
Celes saying it to herself, to try to understand it.

Nonetheless, Terra answered. &quot;Yes, Celes. I love you. Not as a friend...the 
way you love Locke, and he loves you...I feel the same as he does.&quot;

Celes finally tore her gaze away from Terra&#146;s, lowering her eyes to the 
empty bowl before her. Her face still wore no frown, no smile, nothing.

The silence stretched on for a few moments before Terra continued, &quot;I...I 
don&#146;t want anything of you, Celes. I&#146;m not trying to take you from Locke for 
myself...I&#146;m not trying to do anything. I&#146;m happy that you have him...that&#146;s 
what matters, that you have someone and are happy. I just...need to tell you. 
It&#146;s not right if I don&#146;t tell you...it&#146;s lying to you and to me as well.&quot;

None of this was said with fear. No part of it was unsure. Terra was not 
afraid of the consequences of this...she knew that Celes would not be angry 
with her, or think less of her for this. Celes was too good and decent of a 
person to do such a thing.

Nonetheless, Celes&#146;s continued silence was unnerving, and Terra found 
herself speaking more as the woman she loved continued to sit without a 
word. &quot;You&#146;ve always been there for me...for everyone. You&#146;re a beacon of hope 
to all of us who know you...you never have betrayed your heart, and always 
have fought for what you feel is right. You pressed us all forward towards 
the hope for a better future...even when many of us had given up on it. You 
always strive for the best. I love you for that and so many other reasons, 
Celes...you&#146;ve always been the closest to a hero I have.&quot;

As Terra finished her speech, Celes slowly looked up and met the 
green-haired woman&#146;s eyes once more. &quot;Terra...you talk about how I&#146;ve always 
pressed on...but do you know why I&#146;ve been able to do that, Terra? I can 
only do it when I have hope...

&quot;When I was alone on that island with Cid...I almost gave up hope altogether, 
Terra. It seemed sure that my friends were dead, that the world was dying, 
that everything we&#146;d tried so hard to protect was forever lost. What kept me 
going...was the hope that I could find my friends...could find you all, and 
could find Locke. Locke...Terra, I love Locke. He gives me hope for myself; he 
makes me believe that I can be a better person, that I can truly shed my 
past and live as I wish to. Locke makes me believe that I can be, that 
perhaps I already am, redeemed...Locke gives me hope. I can&#146;t...I can&#146;t live 
without having that hope by my side, without having him by my side.&quot;

Terra nodded, and was about to reassure her friend once more that she didn&#146;t 
intend nor want to cause problems for Celes&#146;s love for Locke, when Celes 
continued, interrupting her before she could begin.

&quot;But...Locke isn&#146;t the only person that gives me hope, Terra. He gives me hope 
for myself...but my hope in humanity, in the ability for us all to come 
together to oppose such an evil as Kefka...that comes from someone else. 
Someone kind, compassionate, earnest, honest...someone who has always since we 
first met shown the best of humanity despite the terrible things that have 
happened. Terra...Locke always gave me hope for myself, hope that I could be a 
better person. But you...Terra, you always gave me hope that we, that 
humanity, can accomplish great things and rebuild all that we lost. I can&#146;t 
imagine living without you any more than I could without Locke...

&quot;Terra, I love you, too.&quot;

Now it was Terra&#146;s turn to sit in silence; hers, however, was not unreadable 
as Celes&#146;s had been, but rather was simply from happy shock. The most that 
she could manage was a stammered, &quot;You...Celes, y-you love me?&quot;

Celes nodded, smiling warmly. &quot;Yes, Terra, I do. I love you.&quot;

Terra did not know how to respond; she had never even conceived that Celes 
might feel the same way about her. All she knew was that she felt happier 
than she had ever felt before.

&quot;Thank you...Celes...thank you so much!&quot; she exclaimed. Words failed her...she 
didn&#146;t know how to act, how to respond, how to tell this woman how 
fantastically happy she had just made Terra.

The blonde woman leaned forward, crossing the table to lay a soft kiss on 
Terra&#146;s lips. Though not powerful or long, it was nonetheless very loving in 
its tenderness.

&quot;Thank you, too, Terra...I&#146;m very happy...you&#146;ve made me very happy,&quot; Celes said 
quietly, gazing into Terra&#146;s eyes.

&quot;You make me happy, too, Celes...&quot;

They just stared happily at one another for a minute or two, then began 
giggling as they both realized that neither had any idea what they should do 
now.

&quot;I never expected you to feel the same way...I don&#146;t know what to do,&quot; Terra 
confessed, still smiling.

&quot;I wasn&#146;t going to tell you yet...I didn&#146;t have any idea how to do it,&quot; Celes 
replied.

A thought struck Terra. &quot;Celes...you love Locke still...how is this--&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t worry,&quot; Celes answered reassuringly. &quot;I...talked with Locke about it 
once I was sure what I felt. He took a little while to understand that I 
still love him just as much...but he does, and he basically told me that if I 
would be happier being with him and you than just being with one of you, 
then he was okay with how I felt and wherever it could lead.&quot;

Terra nodded. &quot;I...don&#146;t love Locke, Celes...&quot; It was not really a statement, 
but not quite a question, either.

&quot;And he doesn&#146;t love you. But...I love you both...and you both love me,&quot; Celes 
said. &quot;We...can work something out...right? I...was hoping that when I got the 
courage to tell you, if you felt the same way, you might come back to Narshe 
with me...to live with us?&quot;

At this point, Terra&#146;s mind was reeling from all the unexpected joy that she 
was feeling more of with each passing moment. Live with Celes? The idea was 
wonderful. She would have to live with Locke, too, of course, but that 
wouldn&#146;t be hard at all--even if she didn&#146;t love him, he was still a very 
important friend to her, after all. And if her heart had no jealousy of him 
before, when she didn&#146;t even imagine that Celes would feel the same way 
about her, it wouldn&#146;t feel jealous sharing her.

&quot;Can I...can I come back to Mobliz with you once a month to see the children?&quot; 
Terra asked. The children all had parents and homes now, so Terra was not 
worried about their safety, but she couldn&#146;t bear leaving them completely.

Celes nodded. &quot;Of course! You can do whatever you want, Terra. I&#146;ll be happy 
to be loved by you and to love you no matter what...&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Terra said, trying to calm herself down to think rationally. &quot;I 
can&#146;t go with you tomorrow to Narshe...but I think that I can be ready to go 
with you by the next time you come.&quot;

Celes smiled, a hint of amusement mixed with her genuine happiness. &quot;I&#146;ll 
miss you as always until then...more than always.&quot;

They sat for a moment, unsure of what to say. Then Celes slowly, timidly 
leaned forward to softly kiss Terra&#146;s lips. The old saying that actions 
speak louder than words is not always true, but it well described this case. 
What the two women could not properly articulate with the bonds of language 
was instantly said clearly by the tender, sweet meeting of their lips.

After a moment of their mouths embracing, Celes broke away from the kiss, 
eyes shining happily. Terra looked back, her expression a mirror image.

&quot;Celes...this is going to forever be a special night to me...&quot; Terra said 
hesitantly. &quot;My heart and mind were accepted by you tonight...if...if you&#146;d...if 
you&#146;d like to...I&#146;d like--I&#146;d like to offer my...my body as well.&quot;

Celes&#146;s expression became much more serious. &quot;Terra...I...are you...are you sure? 
Terra, you shouldn&#146;t feel like you have to or...I mean, this, this is 
really...are you sure you want that, Terra?&quot;

Terra nodded, nervous but certain. &quot;I love you...I want you to be the first 
and only person to share that with me. It doesn&#146;t matter if it&#146;s now or any 
other time...but...this night is so wonderful already...it would be wonderful to 
have my first time now, with you.&quot;

Celes nodded. &quot;And you will be the first and only woman I&#146;ll ever be with, 
Terra.&quot;

No words were spoken after that. None were needed, really. Both rose from 
the table, and, hand in hand, walked to Terra&#146;s bed. For a moment, Terra 
wished that her bed were larger, more impressive somehow to make this more 
special.

Then, as they reached the side of the bed, Celes pulled the green-haired 
woman to her for a much stronger kiss than before, and Terra realized that 
there was no way this could possibly be more special.

This kiss was powerful, demanding and giving at the same time, and Terra 
quickly found herself lost within it. Celes pressed against Terra&#146;s mouth 
with force, heat, passion, and Terra pushed back as equally as she could 
manage. She felt something pressing against her lips, seeking entrance, and 
she opened her mouth a little to accept Celes&#146;s tongue. The blonde warrior&#146;s 
tongue found her love&#146;s, and the two began to gently stroke and caress one 
another. It was fun, exciting, yet was just as loving as their first kiss 
had been, simply in a different way.

As they enjoyed the deep kiss, Celes and Terra embraced one another tighter 
and began to unconsciously move slowly against one another, enjoying the 
small, teasing feeling of pleasure that came from the friction.

After a small time of this, Celes knew that, wonderful as this was, it was 
time to move on. She pulled away from Terra, separating herself from the 
half-esper&#146;s body. She smiled lovingly, and Terra smiled back. Celes reached 
for Terra&#146;s clothes and began to remove them from her at an eager, yet 
measured pace. Terra did the same to what Celes wore, and soon the two women 
stood honest before one another.

Each took a moment to look at the other in excited, even slightly awed 
expectation. Celes marveled at Terra&#146;s soft beauty and Terra at Celes&#146;s 
strong, lovely build.

As they gazed, Terra blushed and shyly said, &quot;Celes, um, I don&#146;t...I don&#146;t 
really know what to do...I&#146;ve never been with anyone before...&quot;

Celes gave a small, nervous giggle, uncharacteristic for one usually so 
serious. &quot;Well, I&#146;ve only been with Locke before, so...I don&#146;t really know 
much more about how to love a woman than you do. I, er, guess we just...see 
what works? I have a little idea from being with Locke, but...&quot;

&quot;This will be wonderful no matter what, Celes...because I&#146;m with you,&quot; Terra 
said reassuringly.

Celes came forward and kissed Terra again, gently pushing the woman back 
against the bed&#146;s edge until she sat down upon it. Still further did Celes 
push, though, until Terra found herself lying on her back, looking up at 
Celes&#146;s playfully grinning face above her. The woman lowered her face to 
Terra&#146;s right breast. She and Terra watched one another silently, 
motionlessly, for a moment. Then, Celes flicked her tongue out to quickly 
lick Terra&#146;s by now hardened nipple.

Terra gasped, back arching slightly, at the sudden, powerful, but far too 
quickly over feeling. Her eyes begged Celes for more, and she gasped again, 
louder now, as Celes fulfilled her wish and began to gently work upon the 
nipple again with her tongue, stroking it, circling it, darting against it. 
Terra groaned at the extraordinarily nice sensations.

Celes removed her tongue as quickly as she had applied it and raised her 
head, moving now to Terra&#146;s other, unattended breast whose erect tip 
screamed for attention. Her hand reached up to continue to give attention to 
the breast she had left, flicking and tweaking and lightly pinching the wet 
peak. She descended upon her new target, and gave it stronger treatment as 
she took the nipple into her mouth, playing at it with her tongue, lightly 
sucking, even occasionally giving it a very, very soft brush against her 
teeth.

Terra, by this time, had closed her eyes and was whimpering as she gasped, 
Celes&#146;s play becoming more and more unbearably lovely with each passing 
moment. Her eyes opened, however, as Celes relinquished her oral hold upon 
her love&#146;s breast and likewise removed her hand from the other. Though Terra 
questioned with her eyes, Celes&#146;s expression revealed nothing, save that it 
was far from over.

Celes seemed to retreat a few feet down, closer to the edge of the bed, then 
stopped above the green garden where Terra&#146;s legs joined. She looked down 
upon it for a few moments as Terra watched on, squirming a little as Celes&#146;s 
labored breath alone gave her small, teasing pleasure.

Teasing was not Celes&#146;s intention, even if it was a pleasant result. She had 
stopped because she simply needed to admire this beautiful sight before her, 
and, frankly, because she needed to steel herself for what she was about to 
do. Some of her best times with Locke had been when he had done this for 
her, and she wanted to make this the best that she could for Terra, but 
still, it seemed a fairly daunting task in the moment before she began. Even 
though the light, musky aroma was inviting, Celes could not help but 
hesitate just a little.

But her eyes raised to Terra&#146;s, and she lost her uncertainty at the 
expectant, loving look she saw. She wanted to make this a wonderful, 
memorable experience for Terra, no matter what. So she lowered herself a bit 
more, and tentatively brushed her tongue along the outer rim of her vagina, 
then used her hands to hold the entrance open as she pushed her tongue 
within.

Terra could not help squealing slightly at the immensely wondrous feeling of 
Celes&#146;s slick muscle within her. Such an incredible feeling, to have the 
woman she loved so connected to her as to actually be within her! And oh, 
so, so very good to feel it move and press...

Terra had her head back on the bed, eyes closed as she panted and made soft 
keening noises as Celes worked a magic that had not disappeared. For her 
part, Celes was wondering why she had hesitated before--not only was this 
actually very enjoyable, but it even tasted fairly pleasant! Certainly 
indescribable, but good all the same. While Celes was not enjoying this 
nearly so much as Terra, she was still having a good time.

Celes continued to lick and caress the inside of Terra, enjoying every 
moment of it. Terra was soon squirming and arching her back, trying to press 
against Celes&#146;s marvelous tongue as much as possible while whimpering, 
moaning, urging Celes to keep going. Celes was all too happy to comply for 
her lover, and continued her ministrations, slowly but surely speeding and 
intensifying them. Finally, as Terra was becoming incoherent, Celes 
retracted her tongue and shot it out forcefully across Terra&#146;s needy 
clitoris.

Terra let out a short, but very loud scream, shaking and trembling and 
grabbing as hard as she could at the bed&#146;s sheets as her thighs pressed 
against the sides of Celes&#146;s head. As she experienced her indescribably 
wonderful orgasm, Celes kept going, savagely attacking Terra&#146;s clitoris with 
her tongue still, licking and pressing and swirling around it as fast and 
hard as she could. It was so powerful a stimulation that Terra found herself 
nearly unable to breathe as she almost immediately had a second orgasm 
moments after the first had stopped. She could do nothing but call out in 
bliss for a happy eternity before Celes finally slowed her workings and 
allowed Terra to return from pleasure&#146;s grasp.

Terra lay on the bed, gasping, unable to think of anything but how wonderful 
that had been. She felt more than saw Celes climb onto the bed and lay 
beside her, softly kissing her cheek.

&quot;Th...thank you...so much, Celes,&quot; Terra weakly managed.

Celes smiled and kissed Terra again, this time softly upon the lips. &quot;I love 
you, Terra...you&#146;re welcome.&quot;

After a few minutes, Terra had regained most of her strength. She turned to 
Celes, who was idly watching her, and asked, &quot;Celes...could you...I&#146;m still 
technically a virgin...could you...&quot;

Celes&#146;s idle expression turned serious. &quot;You...want me to take your virginity, 
Terra?&quot;

&quot;I want you to take what&#146;s yours,&quot; Terra replied, soft but sure.

Celes was silent for a moment.

&quot;It...It will hurt, Terra.&quot; Concern.

&quot;I know.&quot; Trust.

&quot;It probably will hurt a lot.&quot; Hesitation.

&quot;I want to be yours in every way, Celes.&quot; Love.

Celes slowly nodded and rose to sit upon her knees. She then gently placed 
an arm under Terra&#146;s back and raised her slightly off the bed. Terra 
complied, using an arm of her own to hold herself up and the other arm to 
caress Celes&#146;s cheek.

Celes thought for a moment, unsure of how to do this--after all, she did not 
have the same method that Locke had taken her virginity with available to 
her. As she considered this, Terra&#146;s arm lowered itself to one of her love&#146;s 
breasts, beginning to gently stroke it, occasionally brushing the nipple and 
causing Celes to sigh contentedly.

Finally coming to a decision, Celes raised her free hand and did her best to 
bring its fingers together as one. She slowly lowered it thus shaped to 
Terra&#146;s lower center and carefully, cautiously began to ease it in. Terra 
let out a groan and squeezed Celes&#146;s breast mildly. Celes quickly looked at 
her lover to see if this was hurting her, but it was obvious from Terra&#146;s 
pleased, expectant expression that this was doing just the opposite.

Celes slowly continued to push her hand further in, sharply taking a breath 
as Terra lightly squeezed Celes&#146;s nipple in response. As Terra&#146;s inner walls 
pushed against Celes&#146;s hand, the former general continued her advance until 
she met Terra&#146;s virgin wall. She cautiously retracted her hand a bit, then 
pushed forward to the same point, and began to repeat the cycle.

Terra found herself experiencing immense pleasure once more, feeling 
blissfully full from Celes&#146;s actions. She ceased her play of Celes&#146;s breast 
in favor of moving her hand further down until it lingered before the blonde 
knight&#146;s vagina. Hesitantly, she pushed a finger past the outer lips.

Celes&#146;s breath caught as she felt this invasion within her. Though she had 
been more concerned with Terra&#146;s happiness, Celes had nonetheless become 
very excited thus far and the feeling of Terra&#146;s digit within her was 
spectacular.

Seeing the effect of her actions, Terra pulled her finger slightly out in 
order to make room for a second, then pressed it back within. Celes let out 
a small yelp and sped her pace within Terra up a little. Terra in turn began 
to explore Celes&#146;s small cavern, wiggling her fingers and moving them 
around.

Celes breathed heavily, desperately attempting to control herself despite 
this tortuously magnificent sensation. The best she could do was to focus 
her attention further to what she was doing to Terra, and she quickened her 
pace slightly again. Terra gasped, and her fingers began to squirm and 
thrust faster as well.

This rhythm continued, each speeding her actions to match the other&#146;s, Celes 
desperately fighting a losing battle to control herself as Terra found her 
clitoris and began to rub it. Finally, Celes, nearly unable to keep herself 
from screaming aloud at the unbelievable pleasure, saw that Terra was close 
to orgasm as well, and, hoping and praying that she could make this as 
painless as was possible, thrust against and through Terra&#146;s hymen.

Terra yelped as tears came to her eyes from the pain. As the sudden flash of 
pain hit her, her fingers unconsciously pushed hard against Celes&#146;s 
clitoris. Celes was driven over the brink, and with a yell of &quot;Terra!&quot; began 
convulsing. Her hand shook and vibrated uncontrollably within Terra, and the 
green-haired woman&#146;s pain was quickly replaced by incredible pleasure as she 
was assaulted within from all sides. She gave a small scream as she joined 
Celes in agonized pleasure, her own unconscious tremblings only adding to 
Celes&#146;s intense bliss as her fingers shook in her lover.

After an immeasurable paradise of pleasure, both women came back to their 
senses, exhausted but contented. Terra removed her fingers from within 
Celes, as Celes likewise removed her hand, which had a little blood upon it. 
Both women lay with on another, silently while their breathing slowed. Then, 
after a few minutes, Celes spoke up.

&quot;I love you, Terra...thank you so much...&quot;

&quot;I love you so much, Celes...you&#146;ve made me so happy.&quot;

Both turned and kissed one another, and felt peace.
