<h1>Melt Into Me (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ff6/index.html">Final Fantasy  6</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sduchess.html">Snow Duchess</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ff6/meltme-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>It was peaceful there. Time had no meaning, and things were so much 
clearer in the spiritual realm. It wasn&#39;t specific memories that came to 
me, so much as a general feeling about certain things. I knew I had been 
the Empire&#39;s lab rat and that I had been forced to do some terrible 
things. I also knew that Celes and I had met years before and that she 
was at least one person who didn&#39;t treat me like I was an animal.

What I didn&#39;t know was why I was different or why I changed. I didn&#39;t 
understand why my mutated body was laying on an altar in a strange place 
with my consciousness floating nearby.

I saw Edgar, Sabin, Locke, and Celes enter the room. Overjoyed, I opened 
my disembodied mouth to greet them when I felt a gentle hand land on my 
shoulder. I looked up into Ramuh&#39;s kind face.

They cannot hear you nor see you, the sage reminded me.

My face fell. I know.

Celes was the first to approach the altar, ever confident, but with her 
brow furrowed in concern. Unconcerned with the heat, she touched an icy 
hand to my face. The contact of the two elements sizzled and steamed, 
and the pink blaze of flame and fur died away, leaving my unconscious 
form human and naked. I guess whatever clothes I had been wearing were 
devoured by the fires of my transformation. Without a word, she 
unclasped the cloak from her shoulders and draped it over my nude body. 
She exuded such tenderness, I nearly cried that I couldn&#39;t wake up to 
ease her worry.

The others watched with unreadable expressions. I guess Celes was still 
pretty cold to them. They didn&#39;t know that a simple gesture like that 
was just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. Not sure how I knew that, 
but that&#39;s not the point.

Ramuh said goodbye to me then and appeared to the Returners, as I could 
not. Lazily, I circled them as they spoke. More than once during their 
conversation, I passed by Celes. Each time she lifted her gaze from the 
Esper and looked around as if sensing something, while the guys didn&#39;t 
seem to notice me. I wondered if perhaps it was part of her military 
training, to have her instincts honed to pick up the tiniest 
fluctuations in the environment around her. Or maybe it was a magic 
thing. Back in Narshe, she had said she felt the Esper&#39;s mind, so maybe 
she felt mine.

Ramuh disappeared in a brilliant flash of light, leaving only a glowing 
stone in his wake. The guys said their goodbyes to the body on the 
altar, and I smiled when Celes turned more in my general direction.

&quot;We&#39;ll be back,&quot; she whispered.

I reached a hand out to brush her cheek, but of course it passed right 
through her. Nevertheless, I saw her eyes register the touch, and the 
corner of her mouth quirked upwards for the briefest of moments.

She turned on her heel and followed the others out, and I was alone. The 
smile turned a bit more sad, but it never left my face.
