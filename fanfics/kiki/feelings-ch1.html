<h1>Feelings</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kiki/index.html">Kiki's Delivery Service</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kain.html">KaintheDragoon</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	I looked over at Kiki. I knew what she was going through. I
had the same experience as a painter. I had comforted her, but that&#39;s
all I could do. I wish I could do more for her. I felt strange; there
was this odd feeling in my stomach.

	&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said smiling. &quot;I have to find my own
inspiration. I release that now. If it wasn&#39;t for you, I&#39;d...
well...&quot;

	I put my hand onto hers. I gave a reassuring smile back.

	&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

	I closed my eyes and smiled again. It was nice to be with her,
to comfort her, to talk with her. She was a person who you&#39;d want to
be with.

	Then I felt something touch my lips. It was warm, soft. It had
this strange feeling to it, and yet it felt familiar. I open my eyes,
and my eyes widened.

	Kiki.

	Her eyes were closed tightly, her face showed a look on her
face, it was serious, but it also revealed a scared look. The feeling
I had suddenly became clearer. She opened her eyes, and her face went
blank, her emotions showed that of a scared child.

	&quot;I...I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

	Tears ran off her face.

	&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;

	I smiled, and wiped the tears from her eyes.

	&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s OK, I said.&quot;

	&quot;I...I felt strange the first time I met you, like I knew you,
like I wanted to be part of you. My emotions are clearer because I&#39;m
with you.&quot; The tears ran down her cheek again. She put her face down,
so it wouldn&#39;t face me. &quot;It probably sounds strange to you.&quot;

	&quot;Not really.&quot;, I said, &quot;I feel the same way too.&quot;

	Her face went up to meet mine.

	I turned my head towards the window.

	&quot;Sometimes, I have this feeling, this feeling of loneliness
out of nowhere, I can&#39;t explain it. Then I think of you and it
disappears.&quot;

	Her eyes widened.

	The feeling I had made sense now. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I had
to say it. I turned my head towards her.

	&quot;I think I&#39;m in love with you. I mean I was going crazy. I
wanted to see you again, that&#39;s why I came. I didn&#39;t know what
happened to you, but I knew you must have been in pain. I wanted to
help you, I don&#39;t know it I did or not.&quot; The words were pouring out of
my mouth, I didn&#39;t want to stop. &quot;I love you Kiki, ever since we first
met, this feeling I had has been bugging me.&quot;

	The quietness lasted for a while. Kiki had this look on her
face I couldn&#39;t describe.

	I broke the silence.

	&quot;I know this sounds strange...&quot;

	&quot;I love you too.&quot;, she said quietly.

	I reached over and she let my lips touch hers. Her eyes
closed. It lasted for several minutes. When we parted lips both of us
were smiling.

	&quot;I feel the same way.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

	When I woke up, Kiki was asleep next to me on the floor. I
moved my hand gently through her hair. I knew I had fallen in love
with her. No matter what happened, I would be there for her.

	She was cute when she was asleep. I moved my hand to her face.
No matter what, I will protect you.

	I smiled

	No matter what I will love you.

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES: Hopefully this story will make sense. Someone
mentioned Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service on the board, and I found it
intriguing. This takes place when Kiki goes over to Ursula&#39;s to sleep
over. If it doesn&#39;t make any sense, sorry. But I hope you enjoyed it
anyways. There&#39;s another story about Kiki and Ursula, hopefully it
will be written soon, if the final paper for college doesn&#39;t kill me
first...

Service, but other great animations like My Neighbor Totoro, On Your
