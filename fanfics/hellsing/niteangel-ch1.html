<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<pre>AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE - This is the first in hopefully a series a fictions based 
on my previous series &quot;Through the Years&quot;.  If you have any suggestions 
on other ideas, please let me know.  I already had one that I&#39;m stewing 
over, but I like to have more.

Okay, it&#39;s been over a month now since I arrived here and already I feel 
like if I don&#39;t do something, I&#39;ll go nuts!  The workload and training 
is almost overwhelming at times, which leaves little time to do things 
like this.  But I feel that, if for some unforeseen reason I&#39;m... how 
can I say this... killed again, I want to leave something behind to 
explain who I really am, not to mention a memory to those I leave 
behind.
 
Well... let&#39;s start from the beginning:
 
My name is Irene Vincent, but I go by the name &#39;Rally&#39;, don&#39;t ask me 
why, I just like the name... and until over a month ago, I used to be 
the owner of a gunshop in Chicago, Illinois named &#39;Gunsmith Cats&#39;.  But 
my real money was being a bounty hunter, bringing in bail jumpers for a 
portion of the bond posted.  I lived in a house outside downtown which I 
shared with May Hopkins, or &#39;Minnie&#39; May as she is known,  a girl who 
used to be one of the highest-paid hookers in Chicago&#39;s Chinatown - 
until her boyfriend Kenny took her out of that life and made her one 
hell of an explosives expert.   A dangerous life, but the money was 
good.
 
But that changed over a month ago.  
 
At that time, an old friend from my childhood, Sir Integra Fairbrook 
Wingates Hellsing, came to visit from England.  And because of her 
visit, my eyes were opened to another world that existed... a world 
where creatures walk in the cold of the darkness (heh... listen to me, 
I&#39;m writing like some cheap melodrama author).  I&#39;m talking about 
vampires.
 
I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the whole thing... until on 
that night that crazy priest Alexander Anderson made his &#39;warning&#39; 
(really a threat) about staying away from Integra, and her explanation 
that they existed.  Then I met Alucard, possibly one of the most 
powerful vampires there is.  And then I met... her, the person I would 
later call &#39;Master&#39;... Seras Victoria.
 
During the time Integra assigned her to watch over us, I have to admit I 
was utterly fascinated by this woman.  I mean, for all I knew at the 
time, she could have been at least half as old as Alucard (I found out 
that he&#39;s over 500).  It wasn&#39;t until later I found out she was only a 
vampire for about three years.  But God... she was so beautiful.  I felt 
like I was falling in love with her... or at least her figure, which she 
has one that wouldn&#39;t quit!  But I also found out how brave she was... 
by the way she shoved me out-of-the-way of Anderson&#39;s blessed bayonets 
and took them herself!  Afterwhich, I thought I would be generous and 
gave her some of my blood... which I ended up bound to her.
 
Too bad that bond didn&#39;t solve the problem of that damn bitch Goldie 
kidnapping May, which she lured me into her god-damned trap.  Roy was 
always saying if I didn&#39;t think things through first, it would be the 
death of me.  And I guess he was right in a way.  Turned out when Alfie 
(who at first helped Goldie but later had a change of heart) was trying 
to disarm the bomb she set to knock me silly, he set of a booby-trap, 
which in the end caused me to be buried under about a half a ton of 
concrete roof.  I was about to die from the injuries I suffered from the 
attack, but because I wanted to free May from Goldie&#39;s grubby hands, I 
made a choice which changed me forever... my master Seras, with my 
permission, made me a vampire.  Not exactly ideal, but it sure beats 
being on a slab in the morgue... I think.
 
Anyway, to put it in a nutshell, Goldie ended up as my meal, I got into 
another fight with that bastard Anderson (I think I won it), and you 
would think &#39;happily ever after&#39;.  Well... not exactly.  Because I was a 
vampire now, instead of staying in Chicago, where I was a danger to my 
friends and the rest of the town, I made the choice of traveling to 
London, where I now live in the basements of the Hellsing mansion with 
Alucard and Master, as well as keeping England safe from other vampires.
 
Okay, I&#39;ve caught you up so far.  Now how I&#39;ve adjusted so far...
 
When I arrived at the Hellsing mansion, it looked as if it hadn&#39;t 
changed the last time I was there... which was ten years ago.  Oddly, my 
new eyes had found something that wasn&#39;t there the last time... namely 
the remnants of bullets and an oh-so-faint odor of cordite.  Found out 
from Master that a couple years back, a bunch of shitheads known as the 
Valentine Brothers had made a raid on the place, which more-or-less 
cleaned out the army Integra had.  There were some other incidents that 
happened after that, but Integra, Alucard and Master won&#39;t explain much 
about it.  
 
Anyway, Integra needed another army and Walter (like that guy, by the 
way) had the idea of hiring a bunch of mercenaries named the Wild Geese, 
which watched the place while Integra was in Chicago.  The leader of 
this group, a one-eyed French  pervert named Pip Bernadotte, is always 
hitting on Master, even though she told him she was a lesbian and was 
not interested in him (got to admit, though, the guy doesn&#39;t give up).  
As for Pip, if he didn&#39;t act like a real jerk, he actually a really nice 
guy, and a good soldier to boot.  I think he tried to pick me up once 
when Master stood him up again, but I gave him this look and he sorta 
backed away.  Now whenever I see him, he makes it a habit to talk to me 
at a distance of... oh, about ten feet. 
 
As for my training, which kept me busy for most of the month, it was 
murder.  Both Master and Alucard teach me, but I rather study with 
Master.  Alucard is a bit intense for my taste, but he means well.  So 
far, I&#39;ve got the knack of controlling my strength without breaking some 
human&#39;s hand when I shake it (nearly did that with Pip).  As for 
transformations... that&#39;s a different story.  The first time I tried to 
take on a bat form, I ended up going for a day with bat wings for arms 
before I was able to control the change.  I&#39;ve yet to try changing into 
mist or a wolf; I&#39;m right now concentrating on the bat form.  As for a 
rat... it still unnerves me.  I can&#39;t stand rodents in any form, and the 
first time Alucard transformed into a rat in front of me, I nearly broke 
through a foot-thick stone wall backing away screaming.
 
It took me a little longer to get used to sleeping in a coffin.  I had 
to travel to England locked in a padded crate (with Master that is).  
But my first night at the mansion, I had to face sleeping in a box 
smaller than that.  Thankfully, Walter was there when I got in before 
sunrise.  However, when the lid was closed, I had a small panic attack.  
Let&#39;s face it, you normally get into a coffin after you&#39;ve died and 
couldn&#39;t do anything about it.  Of course, I&#39;m dead, but I&#39;m still 
kicking, and I nearly wrecked that box when the lid was shut.  I don&#39;t 
know if I pleaded with Walter to let me out; panic seems to bring about 
a bit of memory loss.  But when the sun rose, I suddenly felt so tired, 
I just dropped off without any fuss.  After that, I didn&#39;t mind it so 
much anymore.
 
I think the hardest part about being a vampire is controlling my 
bloodthirst.  The taste of bagged blood doesn&#39;t seem to do it for me 
(must be the anticoagulants or the fact that the stuff was a week away 
from being thrown-out).  But going for fresh blood is out of the 
question, unless it happens to be someone Integra wants quietly... dealt 
with.  I never did like killing, except as a last resort, although 
Goldie wasn&#39;t so tough.  But there were times, though, that I would get 
so hungry that I would wish I could just take some fresh.  Then an 
unpleasant thought would come over me, like Integra forcing herself to 
destroy me because I lost control.  I would just imagine what she would 
be thinking and grab another bag.  The bags are safer.
 
I don&#39;t know, I could go on forever about what&#39;s going on while we were 
sitting on our butts doing nothing but training.  I&#39;m just glad Master 
was able to convince Integra not to make me wear the same uniform Master 
wears (although I have to admit I do look good in a miniskirt).  
Strangely, Integra was able to get together an outfit similar to what I 
wore when I killed Goldie.  Walter, I think, gave me the best 
compliment, saying that it fit me.  Alucard made mention that I can be 
able to recreate my clothes when I get stronger.  Pip even said I looked 
good... before the little perv tried to pinch my butt!  He must&#39;ve hid 
in the woods near the mansion for the remainder of the night after that.
 
Well, a lot of the other stuff I&#39;m going through is rather harmless and 
really not worth mentioning.  My mind is still trying to digest the 
events from the last few days.  Maybe by writing about what had 
happened, I can make some sense of it... not the ending, I don&#39;t really 
mind that... but how it started.  It began like this...
 
There was a disturbance at a village near Bath, in the east of the 
country.  From what the intelligence was able to gather, a FREAK... an 
artificial vampire... was wreaking havoc and had to be dealt with.  For 
those who don&#39;t know, these FREAKs have got this microchip implanted in 
him/her.  All I can say is that they are like vampires, but not true 
undead.  They don&#39;t create other vampires from those they bite, just a 
bunch of butt-ugly ghouls who do nothing but eat other humans or rip 
them to shreds.  
 
Anyway, Integra dispatched us - me, Master and Alucard, to that village 
to deal with the problem.  We arrived there sometime after sunset.  
While Alucard dealt with the FREAK responsible for the trouble, me and 
Master cleaned up his leftovers - the ghouls the FREAK created.  The 
last time I had to deal with ghouls, it was at Goldie&#39;s house.  It was 
easy, though... I created those two ghouls in the first place and all I 
had to do was to tell them to drop dead.  No such luck this time.
 
Master went in ahead of me.  She had that damn big gun of hers, the 
Harkonnen (Walter made it for her, he must like reading &#39;Dune&#39; to give 
it that name).  The first shell she fired, an explosive shell, cleaned 
out about ten to fifteen of those walking compost piles.  As for myself, 
I had a Barrett sniper rifle with me, with my trusty CZ-75 as backup.  
Walter was able to modify it for me, gave it a tighter trigger and 
recoil spring, not to mention a barrel plated with titanium nitrate... 
to handle the big-ass ammo he crafted for me.  Let me tell you how to 
handle ghouls that are not your own.  The big problem is that no matter 
how much you shoot, they still come back up, even with a conventional 
9mm.  Thank goodness I had the Barrett or I would&#39;ve been in real 
trouble.
 
I don&#39;t know how long into the battle before it hit me... how can I 
describe this without horrifying everyone... but during the battle, I 
seemed to slip into some sort of insanity.  I became a complete animal 
during the battle, actually enjoying laying waste all those ghouls.  
Even after the first wave was done, I was looking forward to killing 
more of them.  Then the second wave hit, but these guys were armed.  One 
of their shots took out the Barrett, so I decided to wade in that group 
with the CZ-75.  Alucard would later tell me that I was laughing like 
some sort of homicidal maniac.  Thinking back, I think I was laughing.  
I guess I was really out of it, hacking, whacking and ripping apart 
ghouls as I went.  By the time the second wave was over, I was covered 
in blood and various parts of the ghouls that I put out of their misery.  
But I was on a killer&#39;s high, wanting more and not caring who it was.  
My hypersensitive hearing caught a scuffling behind me.  I must have 
been grinning like some demented psychopath as I turned around, ready to 
send another ghoul to the great beyond.
 
It was a good thing the scream brought me back to clarity.  It was a 
little girl standing behind me.  Somehow in all that chaos, she managed 
to hide out while her family was being killed by or hiding from that 
FREAK.  Seeing me, covered in blood and gore, with a crazy smile on my 
face, terrified... and saved... her.  But seeing that cute face scared 
out of her wits was a little too much for me.  I froze right then and 
there... just as another ghoul was sneaking up on me.  Thank goodness 
Alucard had finished with that FREAK and blew it away with his Jackal.
 
The rest of the Wild Geese were called in to help clean up the mess 
afterward.  Everyone gave their reports on what had transpired that 
night.  Problem was... I was too messed-up in the head to get a clear 
report, that little girl&#39;s scared face still fresh in my mind.  Integra 
could see what&#39;s wrong and gave me the next few nights off.
 
But ever since that night, I had trouble sleeping.  I kept having these 
nightmares, all of them ended with me killing that little girl.  It was 
driving me so crazy, I was actually contemplating standing outside at 
daybreak until the sun burned me to a crisp.  I wanted to talk to 
somebody, but talking to Alucard was out-of-the-question.  I was certain 
he wouldn&#39;t understand.  And I wasn&#39;t so sure about Integra or Walter.  
It was getting to the point that I was beginning to doubt my sanity when 
I considered talking to Pip... when Master noticed what was wrong and 
asked me to her room after training.
 
It took a bit of cajoling on Master&#39;s part, but after a while, I finally 
let loose with my story, along with my suicidal fantasies.  And believe 
it or not... I ACTUALLY broke down and started crying.  Good thing 
Master had plenty of tissues or else my clothes would&#39;ve been stained by 
my tears (I wonder why vampires cry blood instead of real tears).  She 
let me cry for a while, stroking my head as I did.  And then it 
happened... she drew me into a gentle hug and kissed me.  I mean, I&#39;ve 
kissed Master before... but this kiss was different.  It was the deepest 
most passionate kiss I ever had with her.
 
I would like to go into detail about what happened next... but I think 
anyone reading this in the future would die from embarrassment... or at 
the very least give that French pervert Pip a fatal hard-on.  To say the 
least, it was the first time I ever made love to anyone... least of all 
a woman.  Master was kind, tender... very understanding.  From that one 
night, I learned that I was loved even more than before.  Personally, I 
don&#39;t care what others think about me.  I may be a vampire, a child of 
the night... but I like to think I have human feelings, no matter what 
Alucard thinks.
 
I&#39;ve moved into Master&#39;s quarters afterwards, a bit larger that my small 
room.  She even has something resembling a real bed!  Of course, it&#39;s 
closer to a king-sized coffin, but it&#39;s larger, which means I get to 
snuggle next to Master whenever I want.  Walter is always complaining 
we&#39;re both making out like weasels before and after sunrise, but that&#39;s 
him.  I&#39;m not sure if Pip knows what me and Master are doing... but I&#39;m 
certain he would like to get in on the action!
 
But... I wonder what happened to that girl?

&quot;Rally, are you done over there?&quot; Seras Victoria asked, dressed in a 
bathrobe and leaving the shower area of their quarters.
 
Rally was already dressed, having showered long ago.  &quot;Oh... Master,&quot; 
she blundered, almost closing the laptop she was working on.  &quot;Just 
about... I was adding a few lines.&quot;
 
Seras leaned over and draped her arms around Rally&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;Still 
working on that journal of yours, aren&#39;t you?&quot; she purred, kissing 
Rally&#39;s cheek.
 
&quot;What else, Master?&quot; answered Rally.  She maneuvered the laptop to 
Seras, who viewed the contents.  &quot;Tell me, how am I doing with this?&quot;
 
The Draculina looked over what Rally had written.  &quot;I see you&#39;re still 
bothered with that girl,&quot; she said.
 
Rally&#39;s face took upon a gloomy cast.  &quot;I just can&#39;t get over the fact 
that I may have badly traumatized her, Master,&quot; she said.  &quot;I mean... 
here I was, covered in blood and pieces of ghoul, possibly with a crazy 
look on my face... and I end up face-to-face with this kid!  I wouldn&#39;t 
be too surprised if she has nightmares for the rest of her life because 
of it.&quot;
 
&quot;I think being surrounded by ghouls looking to eat her is enough to 
cause those nightmares,&quot; Seras replied, trying to comfort Rally.  She 
was about to say more when a tapping came at their door.  Making sure 
her robe was tightly tied - in case it was Pip at the door - Seras 
opened it to find Walter C. Dolnez standing there, a tray with two blood 
packets on ice in his hands.
 
&quot;Oh, I did not know you were not dressed yet,&quot; the butler said.  &quot;I&#39;ll 
just wait outside then.&quot;
 
&quot;No, it&#39;s alright, Walter.  I&#39;m a bit hungry right now,&quot; Seras 
apologized.
 
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rally added, taking one of the blood packets, &quot;thanks a lot.&quot;
 
&quot;My pleasure,&quot; Walter said.  &quot;Oh by the way, Sir Integra recently this 
letter in the post this afternoon.&quot;  He then produced a letter from 
underneath his vest.  &quot;I am not certain, but I believe it is from that 
girl you rescued that night near Bath.&quot;
 
Rally&#39;s insides clenched upon the mention of the girl.  &quot;How... how is 
she?&quot; she meekly asked.
 
&quot;I cannot say... I haven&#39;t read it yet.&quot;  Walter handed the letter to 
Rally.  &quot;But Sir Integra did take a look at it and suggested that I give 
this to you.&quot; 
 
Rally took a few breaths to steady herself... not necessary for her 
existence, but it did calm her down a it.  &quot;Okay Walter, let me have 
it.&quot;  She held out her hand to except the letter.  
 
For a few seconds, she hesitated, then she opened up the letter and 
viewed its contents.  First, Rally seemed to be struggling to understand 
the letter, then a look of surprise came over her face, followed by a 
smile and a single bloody tear.  After Seras had given her a tissue to 
blot her face off, she asked, &quot;I take it that it&#39;s good news?&quot;
 
&quot;That... and more, Master,&quot; Rally answered, still smiling.  She strained 
to make-out the poorly-written words, obviously made by a young girl.  
&quot;She wrote, &#39;I just wanted to let you know that...&quot; she sniffled, 
&quot;&#39;thank you for saving me.  I was scared when you looked at me, but I 
know you had to be scary to save me.  Anyway, Mummy and Daddy had been 
saved by the man in red and were happy to see me.  Again, thank you.&#39;&quot;  
He wiped a few bloody tears from her eyes.  &quot;Thank you, Walter... for 
bringing me that letter.  But how did...?&quot;
 
&quot;The letter was given by the parents to a government official, then the 
Queen,&quot; Walter explained.  &quot;When she realized the meaning of the letter, 
she forwarded it to Sir Integra, which she then told me to give it to 
you.&quot;
 
&quot;Well... if you possibly can, find some way of thanking that girl for 
me, could you, Walter?&quot; the dusky-skinned vampire asked.
 
Walter nodded his approval.  &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to get 
things prepared for this evening.  Sir Integra expects both of you to be 
ready in case we are needed,&quot; the butler said.
 
&quot;Will do, Walter,&quot; Seras replied, closing the door as the butler exited.  
Walking over to a nearby wardrobe, she gathered a clean uniform for 
herself, then looked at Rally as she saved what she written and 
logged-off.  &quot;Look, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much, Rally.  
Controlling your mood as you use your powers is just something me and 
Master have to teach you.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re concentrating on eliminating 
ghouls for now.  Only until you have a better handle on your emotions, 
then we&#39;ll go on to fighting vampires.&quot;
 
&quot;Especially those chipped vampires that keep cropping up,&quot; Rally added.  
She then drew Seras into her arms and added, &quot;But at least I wouldn&#39;t 
have to worry about that little problem anymore.  But I wonder... how 
are we going to explain our existence of a little girl?&quot;
 
&quot;I think we&#39;ll let the Knights of the Round Table handle that problem.  
Don&#39;t want to give you too much on your mind,&quot; Seras giggled.
 
&quot;You make things SO simple, Master,&quot; Rally added as the two kissed.

Walter made his way down the dark corridors of the mansion&#39;s 
sub-basement levels and up the stairs.  As he got to the landing, he 
found Alucard, Sir Integra and Pip standing to greet them.  &quot;So she got 
the letter, Walter?&quot; the Hellsing leader asked.
 
&quot;Indeed Miss Vincent has, Sir Integra,&quot; answered Walter.  &quot;Imagine, to 
think that it was the granddaughter of Sir Kensington, one of the Round 
Table, that Miss Vincent had ran into.  But I&#39;m still a little troubled 
that we couldn&#39;t tell her the complete story.&quot;
 
&quot;Well... Sir Kensington is not exactly trusting of vampires,&quot; Sir 
Integra mused.  &quot;He still is a little suspicious of Rally from the time 
she met him.&quot;
 
&quot;Not to mention her use of... shall I say, her rather &#39;colorful&#39; remarks 
to that pompous human&#39;s character did not impress him at all,&quot; Alucard 
added, grinning evilly.
 
&quot;Thank you for reminding me of that, Alucard,&quot; Sir Integra replied 
sourly.  &quot;I was hoping I could forget that little incident.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, at least we are here to make sure you won&#39;t forget, zat&#39;s for 
sure,&quot; Pip added, only to see the others looking at him hostilely.  
&quot;Uh... maybe I should make sure ze Wild Geese are at the training 
grounds, non?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sir Integra said coldly, &quot;it would be a good idea.&quot;  Pip soon 
made his exit, somewhat faster than needed.
 
Alucard watched the one-eyed Frenchman make his hurried exit, then 
added, &quot;I wonder if that fool&#39;s still trying to woo Seras, despite the 
fact she has a girlfriend.&quot;
 
&quot;At least he doesn&#39;t give up, that&#39;s for certain,&quot; Walter added, going 
off to do his chores.
