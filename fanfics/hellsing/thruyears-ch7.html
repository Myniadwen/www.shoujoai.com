<a href="../hellsing/thruyears-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>MORNING, RALLY AND MAY&#39;S HOUSE, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, TWO DAYS LATER...
 
Rally Vincent yawned as she descended the stairs of the house she shared 
with &quot;Minnie&quot; May Hopkins.  It was two days since they returned to the 
house following the promise that Paladin Alexander Anderson would not 
attack them.  She was thankful that the priest had kept his word.  She 
felt more comfortable with familiar surroundings rather than a strange 
place.
 
The front door opened, slightly startling Rally.  &quot;Good morning,&quot; May 
chirped cheerfully, carrying several bags from the local McDonalds.  
&quot;Sorry I was a little late, Rally, but after Kenny got back, I thought I 
would... well... you know...&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, I do know,&quot; Rally smirked, wondering what sleazy sex acts May had 
in mind for her boyfriend Ken Takazawa, who had taught her friend about 
explosives.  
 
For the next few minutes, the two girls munched the various items May 
had bought.  In-between the meal, the petite explosives expert placed 
her hands on the table and said, &quot;By the way, Rally, do you notice 
anything... different about me?&quot;
 
&quot;Like what?&quot; Rally asked, still munching on her sausage biscuit.
 
&quot;Aw geez Rally,&quot; May groaned, &quot;are you THAT dense just to even notice?&quot;  
She then rested her head on her hands... with the fingers displayed 
towards Rally.
 
At first, the dusky-skinned bounty hunter simply ate her breakfast, 
hardly noticing anything.  But when May openly displayed her hands, 
Rally decided to look... and her eyes widened.  On the left hand of May, 
there was a diamond ring on the appropriate finger.
 
Nearly gagging on her food, Rally quickly leaned over, looking at the 
ring.  &quot;May... don&#39;t tell me... you mean... Kenny...?&quot; she managed to 
say, smiling.
 
&quot;Yeah he did,&quot; May replied, tears in her eyes, &quot;... and I said yes!&quot;
 
Almost as quickly as May answered, both girls found themselves hugging 
each other franticly.  &quot;OH WOW MAY, I DON&#39;T BELIEVE IT!!!&quot; Rally cried, 
tears also in her eyes.  Settling down, Rally calmed herself down and 
asked, &quot;So... have you and Kenny set a date yet?&quot;
 
&quot;Not yet,&quot; the blonde explosive expert added, looking a little sad.  
&quot;There&#39;s still that price on his head that mob boss placed on him.  But 
at least it&#39;s a start.&quot;  Looking upstairs, she added, &quot;You know, it&#39;s 
too bad Seras is asleep.  I think she would&#39;ve enjoyed the news.&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;m sure she might,&quot; Rally added, giggling, &quot;but we&#39;re going to 
have to tell her about you and Kenny... at least the edited version.  I 
don&#39;t know if she can handle the director&#39;s cut.&quot; 
 
May then turned around and looked at Rally&#39;s face.  Rally was a little 
flushed, and if May wasn&#39;t mistaken, she was smiling.  &quot;Okay Rally, 
what&#39;s on your mind now?  Are you still fantasizing about Seras?&quot;
 
In the past, whenever May has asked a question similar to that, Rally 
would become extremely defensive and try to explain her way out of it, 
stumbling along the way.  But this time, Rally looked at her friend 
thoughtfully and said, &quot;Yeah... I guess I am.  You know, May, this is 
something new for me.  I mean... I never really thought of myself as a 
lesbian.  I just thought that every man I ran into was either married, 
obsessed with their jobs, a stupid pervert or real jerks like Bill.&quot;  
She then sat herself down, a dreamy look on her face, &quot;But then I saw 
Seras, and granted I didn&#39;t think much of her besides her body... she 
got a nice one, too.&quot;  She giggled before resuming, &quot;But somehow, she 
can be a very brave person... like the way she pushed me away from 
Anderson&#39;s knives and took them herself.&quot;
 
&quot;Are you sure it isn&#39;t that bite she gave you when you had to give her 
some of your blood?&quot; asked May, sounding somewhat doubtful as she 
pointed to the bandage on Rally&#39;s neck. &quot;I mean... ever since then, 
you&#39;ve been acting... well... more and more goofy if someone even 
mentions Seras&#39; name.&quot;  
 
&quot;I guess part of it.  That bite must have brought forth feelings I never 
had,&quot; Rally shrugged.
 
May sighed as she ate her hotcakes.  &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she said.  &quot;But 
aren&#39;t you afraid of what&#39;s going to happen when she returns to England 
with Alucard, Walter and Integra?&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?&quot;  Rally suddenly looked surprised at May&#39;s observation. 
 
&quot;The Hellsing Organization isn&#39;t going to be in Chicago forever, Rally,&quot; 
May explained.  &quot;Look, take it from someone with experience in these 
matters:  long-distance romances are not the easiest things to get used 
to.  You&#39;ve got too much of this town in you, and I doubt you&#39;ll drop 
everything you&#39;ve got just to follow her to London.&quot;
 
&quot;I... never thought of that,&quot; Rally said, now sounding concerned.  
&quot;You&#39;re right about a few things, May.  I mean... what about the shop 
and the house?  I certainly can&#39;t leave those!&quot;
 
&quot;Well don&#39;t worry about it for now,&quot; added May, finishing up, &quot;When the 
time comes, I&#39;m certain you&#39;ll figure it out.&quot;  Getting up, she added, 
&quot;I&#39;m getting showered up.  As soon as I&#39;m dressed, we better open up the 
shop.&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?  Oh... yeah, we better get ready,&quot; stumbled Rally, also finishing 
her breakfast.  However, what May had said really bothered her.  Falling 
in love with a woman - particularly a vampire - was one thing.  Getting 
used her in a far-away city was another. 
 
Rally soon found herself back in her bedroom, as she got ready for work.  
Going to the walk-in closet near her bed, she quietly opened the door 
and bent down.  Seras Victoria was seated against the wall in a lifeless 
sleep, her knees drawn up to her ample bosom and her arms wrapped around 
her legs as her head was situated on a pillow Rally had generously gave 
her.
 
Rally spent the better part of two minutes watching the sleeping vampire 
before saying in a quiet voice, &quot;Seras... I&#39;m not certain if you can 
hear me.  But I&#39;ve had a little talk with May... and frankly, what she&#39;s 
brought up disturbs me a bit.  She&#39;s right about a few things; England 
can&#39;t be without Hellsing for too long.  But I&#39;m not certain I can be 
away from you for just as long.&quot;  A small tear rolled down her eye as 
she continued, &quot;Seras... I think I love you, but I&#39;m scared about being 
apart from you for any amount of time.&quot;  Rally then noticed her tears 
and chided herself, &quot;Oh look at me,&quot; she sniffled, &quot;I&#39;m crying like a 
little girl.  Come to think of it... between this and finding out about 
May&#39;s engagement was the first time in ten years that I&#39;ve ever cried... 
since Mum was murdered.  Look, I&#39;ve got to go to work.  We&#39;ll talk about 
this when you&#39;re up.&quot;  Drying her face, she then gently kissed Seras&#39; 
cheek before saying, &quot;Bye-bye... my sleeping beauty.&quot;
 
Then quietly closing the door, Rally made her way out to get to work.  
If she had lingered further, then she might have noticed a single bloody 
tear running down Seras&#39; face. 
 
A DESERTED BUILDING, IN A RUN-DOWN PART OF CHICAGO...
 
Alfie was already in a cold sweat as he and one of Goldie Muso&#39;s wards 
walked out of the decrepit building.  &quot;That was quick,&quot; she said, 
smiling as she handed him an envelope.  &quot;Your compensation for this job.  
Thank you.&quot;
 
&quot;Uh.. thank you... I guess,&quot; Alfie said nervously.  &quot;Look... if there&#39;s 
anything else Ms. Muso needs done... I&#39;m not interested... okay?&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; the girl said as she boarded the car where her companion 
waited.  &quot;That should get you a ticket out of town and a hotel until you 
can get on your feet.  Bye-bye.&quot;  The car then drove off.  
 
But as she drove off, Alfie couldn&#39;t help but wonder what he did.  
&#39;Geez,&#39; he thought to himself, &#39;I knew I wanted to get even with Rally 
Vincent... but this is not what I had in mind.  I mean... this is Goldie 
Muso, for crying out loud, the very devil walking this earth.  There was 
no way in hell I could ever refuse her, even if I wanted to.  What am I 
going to do?&#39;  
 
For the better part of one hour, as he wandered the deserted streets, he 
agonized over what he did... and how he was going to remedy it.  Finally 
taking a deep breath, he made his decision.  Going to the nearest 
homeless shelter, he put his plan into motion.  In the donation slot, he 
deposited the money he received from Goldie and walked off.  &#39;There... 
that wasn&#39;t so bad.  Now for the hard part...&#39;
 
GUNSHOP &quot;GUNSMITH CATS&quot;, LATER THAT DAY...
 
It was 5:30 in the evening, a half-hour after the door was locked.  The 
sun was about an hour before setting and May had just finished taking 
the till for the day and placed the receipts in the safe for later 
deposit.  After making sure the safe door was locked, she had joined 
Rally&#39;s side as the later finished cleaning up the shop.  But the blonde 
was certain that her friend&#39;s mind wasn&#39;t exactly on her task.  &quot;Still 
bummed out from this morning?&quot; May asked, noticing Rally&#39;s glum mood.
 
It was a few seconds before Rally sighed and replied, &quot;A little.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey... lighten up, Rally,&quot; said May, placing a reassuring hand on 
Rally&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;I&#39;ve never known you to let a little thing like this 
get you down.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; Rally added.  &quot;I mean May... am I kidding myself that I 
can have a relationship as complicated as this?  I love Seras, yes... 
but she also loves Integra.  I&#39;m not really certain if this is going to 
work.&quot;  She sat herself down and leaned on the counter she was cleaning, 
&quot;And even if she does love me as well, I&#39;m a bit scared about giving up 
all I&#39;ve got here to be with her.  This is so complicated.&quot;
 
&#39;It isn&#39;t easy for me as well, Rally,&#39; Seras&#39; voice clearly sounded in 
Rally&#39;s head.
 
&quot;HUH!?!?&quot;  Rally sat up, startled by the force the voice asserted itself 
in her mind.
 
May looked at Rally, clearly surprised.  &quot;Anything wrong?&quot; she asked.
 
&quot;Uh... what?  Oh, nothing May,&quot; Rally answered, shaking her head.  
&#39;Man... what was that?&#39;
 
&#39;I&#39;ll explain when you get home,&#39; again came Seras&#39; voice in her head, 
again startling Rally.
 
May just looked at her friend, wondering if her friend&#39;s mood was making 
her hallucinate.  &quot;Uh... look Rally,&quot; she began, &quot;I&#39;m going to be going 
out to enjoy myself tonight.  I won&#39;t be back home until late.  That 
should give you and Seras some time to talk it out.&quot;  She gathered her 
coat, then turned to her friend at the back door.  &quot;Is there anything I 
can get for you along the way?&quot; she asked.
 
&quot;No, May,&quot; answered the dusky-skinned girl, &quot;you just have fun.&quot;  She 
then thought to herself, &#39;Okay, I&#39;m officially creeped-out now.  How did 
Seras know what I felt?&#39;  Straightening herself out, Rally then made her 
way to the back door, and after saying goodbye to May for the night, got 
in the Cobra and drove home.
 
***
 
Rally had arrived back at the house after taking some time to get a 
sandwich and soft drink, driving up just as the sun was setting.  Just 
as she set foot inside, she saw Seras descending down the stairs, 
wearing her yellow miniskirt uniform.  Before she could say anything, 
though, Rally started in, &quot;Seras... please don&#39;t take this the wrong 
way... but what in the world was that earlier... you know, that bit 
which you talked in my head?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh that?&quot; Seras answered, somewhat innocently.  &quot;Well, believe it or 
not, I did hear what you said this morning, and using the link we have I 
thought I might...&quot;
 
&quot;Wait a minute?  What link?  What the hell are you talking about?&quot; Rally 
shot back.
 
Taken aback from Rally&#39;s reaction, Seras decided to sit down, and 
motioned Rally to do the same.  &quot;Now, how can I put this delicately... 
when you offered me your blood, even though you haven&#39;t died, it set up 
this link between us.  With it, I have the ability to see whatever you 
see and experience.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re kidding?&quot; replied Rally, not liking the notion of Seras finding 
out what&#39;s in her head.  &quot;Alucard never mentioned that!&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; the Draculina added.  &quot;Master has a terrible habit 
of not telling EVERYTHING that he knows... usually letting someone find 
out for themselves.  Look, Rally... I know this is not comfortable for 
you, but I&#39;m afraid it comes with becoming my prey.&quot;
 
&quot;Nice to know, although I still have a little trouble of being referred 
to as &#39;prey&#39;, like I&#39;m some buffet table,&quot; Rally grumbled, but added, 
&quot;Listen, I&#39;m not blaming you.  You&#39;re probably in the middle of this as 
well, and I&#39;m sorry I made you feel uncomfortable.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; breathed Seras, a bit relieved.  &quot;So... you want to talk about 
us?&quot;
 
It was a while before Rally nodded in the affirmative, then sat herself 
next to the young vampire.  &quot;I don&#39;t know how this happened... but even 
before I gave you my blood, I found myself staring at you, although I 
was admiring your body at first.&quot;
 
Seras giggled at this revelation.  &quot;And I thought I only got that 
reaction from men.&quot;
 
&quot;However,&quot; continued Rally, &quot;it was during the ride over here before we 
ran into Anderson, we talked about a lot of things.  I learned about how 
your parents got killed, the problems you had in the orphanage you grew 
up in... in some ways, it was similar to my life.&quot;
 
&quot;But you still have your father.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah... but like you, I had to see my mum get murdered, not a very good 
experience for a nine year-old.&quot;  Rally then held Seras&#39; hand, not 
surprised by the coldness of it.  &quot;And in some way... we have some sort 
of kinship because of it.&quot;
 
&quot;But are you still scared... of falling in love with a vampire,&quot; Seras 
noted sadly.
 
&quot;Are you kidding?  You being a vampire has nothing to do with it,&quot; Rally 
protested.  &quot;You&#39;re a smart, charming woman, despite that.  What I&#39;m 
scared of is that... after Hellsing is done here, you&#39;re going to return 
to England... and I don&#39;t know if I have the courage to abandon 
everything I have here to join you.&quot;
 
&quot;You would do that?&quot; 
 
Rally took some time to think.  &quot;Like I said... I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Rally 
slumped on the couch, sighing heavily as she did... and then nearly 
jumped when Seras leaned over and hugged her.
 
&quot;My poor Rally,&quot; the vampire said in a soft voice.  &quot;I wish I can do 
something to help you.&quot;
 
Rally simply giggled.  &quot;I wonder what Integra would say... seeing her 
girlfriend hugging another girl.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh... about that...&quot; Seras looked a little uncomfortable before 
continuing, &quot;Before I joined you and May, Sir Integra made... quite an 
unusual request of me.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh really?&quot; Rally smirked, as if she knew.  &quot;And just... how unusual?&quot;
 
Seras took some time to think of her answer.  &quot;Well... how can put this 
without sounding perverted... because of Sir Integra&#39;s position within 
the British government as well as the Hellsing Organization, she thought 
that I might try to establish a relationship outside the one me and her 
share... which isn&#39;t much, since she has to keep a respectable distance 
between the troops she commands... which includes me.&quot;
 
&quot;Excuse me but that sounds a little crazy,&quot; remarked Rally, smiling 
slyly.  &quot;Are you telling me that Integra has given you permission to 
fool around... with her knowing about it, to top it off?&quot;
 
&quot;Well I wouldn&#39;t call it &#39;fooling around&#39; in the sense,&quot; Seras said.  &quot;I 
just don&#39;t want to have a relationship with just ANY girl.  Just one 
that I have some sort of feeling about.&quot;
 
&quot;Someone... like me?&quot; Rally asked, sounding hopeful.
 
&quot;Well... yes... if you&#39;ll take me...&quot; Seras said, noticing that Rally&#39;s 
head was edging closer to her&#39;s.  &quot;Uh... Rally...?&quot;
 
&quot;Just hush up,&quot; Rally huskily whispered as she closed her eyes and 
gently kissed Seras.

DOWNTOWN CHICAGO...
 
May walked out of the movie theater with the other patrons, still 
clutching the popcorn bag she had all during the film.  This was a very 
good day for her, as she stopped briefly and admired the engagement ring 
around her finger... then sighed happily and when her way.
 
It was a rather busy night, and May visited a good number of her old 
haunts during her days as a prostitute.  Many of the residents and old 
friends she met still couldn&#39;t believe that May had finally decided to 
settle down and get married, but they all shared their happiness at the 
news.
 
After leaving the old neighborhood, May decided to take in karaoke at a 
nearby bar.  However, along the way, she passed a bridal shop, where she 
looked at the display window.  Inside it, there was a beautiful white 
wedding gown delicately accented with sequins.  It was all the petite 
blonde could do to contain herself, imagining herself wearing the gown 
as she walked the aisle to wed Kenny.  &quot;One of these days, that&#39;s for 
sure,&quot; she said to herself dreamily as she reluctantly tore away from 
the window and headed for the bar.
 
&quot;Uh... excuse me?&quot; a voice called out from behind May.  Turning around, 
she saw two young girls who looked somewhat confused.  &quot;We&#39;re new in 
Chicago, and... well... we&#39;re kinda lost.  Do you think you can show us 
the shortest way to the Goodman Theater?&quot;
 
&quot;Why sure.  I happen to know this town inside and out,&quot; May offered.  
&quot;Hand me that map and I&#39;ll see what I can do.&quot;  She began to look at the 
map, the first girl in front of her while the other looked from behind.  
&quot;Okay... it looks like... MPPPHH!&quot;  Suddenly, the girl behind May placed 
a cloth over her mouth and nose.  May struggled briefly, then slumped 
limply from the chloroform she breathed and the girl behind caught her.  
She along with her partner shoved May in the back seat, then removed 
May&#39;s coat and shoes.
 
&quot;Well, that wasn&#39;t so bad,&quot; the first girl said.  &quot;What&#39;s better, we 
didn&#39;t have to kill anyone this time.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, Mistress Goldie&#39;s going be so pleased,&quot; the second girl giggled 
as she started the car and drove away.
 
RALLY AND MAY&#39;S HOUSE...
 
For the better part of two minutes, Rally and Seras held each other in a 
gentle embrace, quietly kissing each other.  Soon, Rally changed 
positions, gently laying Seras down on the couch while she climbed on 
top of her and taking their kissing to the next level, this time 
plunging her tongue deeply into the vampire&#39;s mouth, careful not to cut 
it on Seras&#39; sharp fangs.  To her credit, the young vampire did the same 
with the bounty hunter, and both girls began frantically groping each 
other&#39;s bodies as they kissed.
 
At one point, Rally moved away from kissing Seras directly and began 
planting kisses on her neck, while her right hand began to massage the 
vampire&#39;s ample left breast, gently squeezing it as she did.  
&quot;OH-AHHH!!&quot; Seras gasped, surprised by the powerful erotic sensations 
she was now experiencing.
 
&quot;Well... what do you know?&quot; Rally smirked, heavily breathing as she 
continued to rub and squeeze the Draculina&#39;s breast.  &quot;Seras... do you 
know you&#39;re not wearing a bra?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Seras, panting.  &quot;I really don&#39;t need to wear one 
anymore... since I became a vampire, my body doesn&#39;t deteriorate like a 
human&#39;s... just so long as I drink blood.&quot;
 
Rally grinned hungrily.  &quot;Is that so?&quot; she lustily whispered.  &quot;I guess 
I&#39;m going to have to find out how much your body has changed... if you 
don&#39;t mind?&quot;  Removing her hand from Seras&#39; breast, Rally slowly moved 
it until it moved back her skirt.  The young vampire&#39;s breathing - 
although it was no longer necessary - began to quicken in lusty 
anticipation as a dusky hand began to plunge itself into her panties...
 
... When the doorbell rang, startling both girls.  &quot;WH-WHAT THE 
HELL!?!?&quot; Rally gasped, jerking her hand back.
 
Coming out of her haze of lust, Seras had a look of recognition, 
followed by one of frustration.  &quot;Oh bloody hell, of all the times... I 
forgot to tell you that Master contacted me this afternoon.  It seems 
that Sir Integra wants a small briefing concerning our efforts in 
helping your country&#39;s Homeland Security department in trying to find 
out how and why Goldie had hacked the A.T.F. database, hopefully to try 
to find her.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Rally said, a hint of disappointment in her voice.  &quot;Boy, 
talk about your mood-killers.  I guess it couldn&#39;t be helped.&quot;  She then 
got herself off Seras, and the two girls made an effort to be as 
presentable as possible before opening the door.
 
When Rally did open the door, she saw Walter standing in front of it.  
&quot;Ah, I see you&#39;re home, Miss Vincent.  I suppose that Miss Victoria has 
told you about her appointment with Sir Integra?&quot;
 
&quot;Uh, yeah she has,&quot; commented Rally, scratching her head.  
 
&quot;Good.  Well Miss Victoria, shall we be off?&quot; he asked, indicating to 
the embassy&#39;s limousine parked in front of the house.
 
&quot;Yes... but could I have a moment first, Walter?&quot; the young vampire 
asked the butler.
 
Walter nodded, then made his way back to the limo.  Turning to Rally, 
Seras then said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Rally.  I should&#39;ve told you beforehand.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey that&#39;s alright,&quot; added Rally.  &quot;I guess I kinda got carried away a 
few minutes ago.&quot;
 
&quot;True, we both did... and I don&#39;t mind it,&quot; nodded Seras, then she 
leaned over to Rally&#39;s ear and whispered, &quot;I&#39;ll probably be gone for an 
hour, maybe two.  Who knows,&quot; she purred, &quot;maybe after I return we 
can... pick up where we left off.&quot;  She then kissed Rally&#39;s cheek and 
hurried off to the limo.  &quot;See you later.&quot;
 
Rally stood by the door as the limo drove off into the night, then 
closed the door when it disappeared.  But another set of eyes was 
watching... namely those of Paladin Alexander Anderson, who was hidden 
in the shadows and holding a powered listening device.  &quot;Ah&#39;ll be true 
t&#39; me word,&quot; he said to himself.  &quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean Ah can&#39;t keep 
an eye on ye.  Tis a good thing Sir Integra came by... Ah really don&#39;t 
think me stomach would&#39;ve been able t&#39; handle what ungodly lusts Rally 
an&#39; that monster were doin&#39;.&quot;

Seras settled herself next to Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing as 
the limo traveled in a random pattern around Chicago&#39;s streets.  In 
another seat, Becky &#39;the Nose&#39; Farrah was seated, laptop open and was 
currently going through some figures.  Walter was driving, and from what 
Seras had sensed, Alucard was there as well, possibly seated next to the 
old butler.
 
Absently, the young vampire looked down on her lap... and abruptly 
folded her arms over her bust, her eyes wide.  &#39;Damn it all,&#39; she 
grumbled mentally, &#39;I&#39;m so aroused, my nipples are now as hard as bloody 
rocks!  They&#39;re showing themselves through my uniform like some tawdry 
stripper&#39;s in a damned cheap burlesque show!&#39;
 
&quot;Miss Victoria,&quot; Sir Integra began, &quot;could you please unfold your arms?  
What your doing is rather disrespectful, especially for our guest.&quot;  
 
Hesitating, Seras reluctantly complied, setting her arms to her sides.  
If Sir Integra noticed Seras&#39; erect nipples showing obscenely through 
her uniform blouse, she made no mention of it... other than a small 
smile and a slight blush.  Becky did notice, but turned her attention 
back to her laptop, her own blush greater than the Hellsing leader&#39;s.
 
&quot;Anyway, Miss Farrah, I was wondering if you&#39;ll be so kind as to inform 
Miss Victoria about your latest findings?&quot;
 
&quot;Er... right,&quot; Becky sputtered, once again facing the two.  &quot;Anyway, 
there was still the little matter about how Goldie was able to hack into 
the A.T.F. database and conceal her whereabouts.  Luckily, I was able to 
develop a brand-new algorithm for such a purpose,&quot; she then smiled at 
Sir Integra, &quot;thanks to some new equipment I was able to buy yesterday.  
Anyway, I was able to identify the computer which they used when they 
hacked the database.  The bad news... it was done using a mobile 
broadband connection, so where they were is out of the question.  
However, I was able to obtain the registration number of the OS of the 
computer, using the new algorithm... and it was a laptop registered to 
Goldie Muso.&quot;
 
&quot;Very good.  At least we now know that it was Miss Muso that 
orchestrated the computer break-in and copied the information to pass on 
to Iscariot,&quot; Sir Integra replied, who looked to Becky and added, &quot;There 
is one thing I&#39;d like to know... you&#39;ve already accomplished what I 
initially contracted, yet you continued to aid me.  Why is it?&quot;
 
Becky looked upward and answered, &quot;I guess you can say it&#39;s personal.  
Goldie&#39;s been a big pain in Rally&#39;s side for a long time.  Because of 
her, a friend of ours, Misty Brown, had to leave Chicago out of fear of 
her.  And Rally personally had to suffer from a Kerasine overdose 
because of Goldie, not to mention what she did to Rally&#39;s father.  I 
just want to see Rally not get harassed any more from her.&quot;  She then 
noticed Seras, who was trying in vain to remove the bumps in her uniform 
caused by her nipples.  &quot;Cold enough for you?&quot; she teased.
 
&quot;Oh knock it off, it&#39;s too embarrassing as it is!&quot; Seras pleaded.
 
&quot;Just kidding,&quot; Becky reassured.  &quot;Seriously though, when I heard May 
mentioned about what happened between you and Rally, I could hardly 
believe my ears.  I&#39;ve known Rally for a long time, and the only 
relationships I&#39;ve known she had either fired 30 rounds a second or went 
from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in eight seconds.&quot;
 
&quot;Really?&quot; the young vampire inquired.  Becky nodded in agreement.
 
All the while, Sir Integra watched Seras and silently remarked the young 
girl.  &#39;How strange,&#39; she though, &#39;When I made the suggestion that Seras 
find someone because of my obligations, I never in my imagination she 
would find Rally.  I just hope my beloved Seras can find it in her heart 
possibly to ask Rally to accompany us when we return to England... 
because I do not wish to see her lonely because of my own pride.&#39;

Walter, who was at the driver&#39;s seat and not privy to the conversation 
in the passenger section, kept an eye on the traffic.  Alucard, who was 
seated next to him, had his legs propped on the dashboard, his fedora 
over his eyes.  &quot;Really Alucard,&quot; the old butler grumbled, &quot;if you are 
to ride alongside me, at least be seated properly and belted in.  I 
realize you have no cause for safety belts... but you could at least 
think about me if we get pulled over by the local police.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, Walter,&quot; the No-Life King muttered as he straightened himself out 
and buckled up.  As he did, he glanced backwards at the passenger 
compartment and smiled.
 
&quot;Are you still spying on your former fledgling&#39;s mind?  Really, that 
girl has a lot on her mind right now and doesn&#39;t need you looking into 
it,&quot; Walter scolded.   
 
&quot;Now don&#39;t be a spoilsport, Walter,&quot; Alucard grinned.  &quot;I didn&#39;t look 
that deeply... just enough to get the gist of what happened before we 
arrived.  You do realize that we&#39;ve interrupted Seras and Rally while 
they were in the middle of...&quot;
&quot;Now that&#39;s enough, Alucard!&quot; Walter snapped.  &quot;I just hope you don&#39;t 
reveal that to poor Seras and have her faint from the experience.&quot;
 
&quot;Actually, Old Friend... I am very happy for Seras,&quot; Alucard countered.  
&quot;However, I could tell from the link she shares with her prey that Rally 
is a little conflicted about joining her when we return home.&quot;
 
&quot;Well I do not think Miss Vincent needs a vampire acting as some 
matchmaker,&quot; Walter said.  &quot;If she wishes to come, then let it be her 
own decision.&quot;
 
Alucard said nothing, but glanced at Walter, as he thought to himself, 
&#39;Perhaps... but I have a feeling that decision has been already made... 
but how is the biggest mystery.&#39;
 
RALLY AND MAY&#39;S HOUSE...
 
&quot;OH WOW, I DON&#39;T BELIEVE IT!!!&quot; Rally exclaimed happily over the phone.  
&quot;IS IT TRUE, DAD!?!&quot;
 
&quot;Now calm down, Irene, don&#39;t make me deaf on this end,&quot; Rally&#39;s father 
chuckled.  &quot;Yes it&#39;s true... somehow, I found out you mother&#39;s killer 
has been brought-in on charges he acted as a contract killer for the 
mob.  The D.A. over here has asked me if I can offer testimony about his 
character... and maybe pressure him into turning in evidence from his 
employers... including the one they sent after me when your mother got 
killed.&quot;
 
&quot;Gosh,&quot; Rally breathed as she wiped a tear from her face, &quot;I hardly 
believe it.  I guess you can finally put Mum&#39;s memory to rest.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes I can,&quot; Mr. Vincent replied, &quot;me and you both.&quot;  
 
&quot;Yeah.  So, Dad... any plans of coming back to Chicago, now that it&#39;s 
over?&quot;
 
After a slight pause, &quot;You know... I&#39;ve been thinking about coming by in 
the next few months, maybe helping you and May out in the shop... who 
knows, if you want me to, I just might take over the shop and leave you 
to do... well, whatever you want.&quot;
 
&quot;You would?&quot; Rally asked, sounding hopeful.
 
&quot;I really don&#39;t know... it&#39;s up to you if you want me to take over, 
Irene.&quot;
 
&quot;Hmmm... I&#39;ll think about that, Dad.  Anyway, it was nice of you to 
call.  Probably see you soon.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay, Irene.  Bye.&quot;
 
&quot;Bye, Dad.&quot;  Rally then hung up the phone and relaxed on the couch.  
&#39;You know... if Dad does take over the shop... maybe I can leave it all 
behind and follow Seras back.&#39;  Leaning back, she took time to relax 
from the stress of the day.  
 
That relaxation was brief... mostly because of a letter that dropped 
through the mail slot at the door.  &#39;What the...?&#39;  Curious, Rally made 
her way through the door and picked up the letter.  Other than her name 
on the envelope, there were no other markings.  With a frown on her 
face, she ripped open the envelope and took the letter from it.  That 
frown was later replaced by a look of shock... followed by almost blind 
rage!  Hastily grabbing her shoulder holster, Rally shot out of the 
house and into the car, firing it up and tearing away.
 
&quot;Hmm... she looked mad,&quot; Anderson said from his vantage point near the 
house.  &quot;This canna be good, Ah can tell.&quot;
 
THE LIMOSINE... 
 
&quot;AAAAUUUUGGGHHHHH!!!&quot; Seras suddenly screamed, clutching her head with 
her hands and bending down as if she was in pain.  
 
&quot;SERAS!!!  WHAT&#39;S WRONG!?!&quot; Sir Integra called out, clearly startled by 
the young vampire&#39;s antics... and was even more shocked to see a look of 
rage on her face, as well as an almost-lupine snarl coming from her 
throat.
 
Quickly slamming her laptop shut, Becky did her best to get as much 
distance she can from the Draculina, who looked as if she was about to 
pounce.  &quot;OH NO!!!!  SHE&#39;S GOING CRAZY!!!&quot; she cried.

Alucard suddenly snapped alert in his seat as Walter heard the cries 
from the back.  &quot;Walter!  Pull the car over!  Something has happened!&quot; 
the No-Life King called out as he passed through the divider of the car.  
Walter didn&#39;t need to ask why as he turned the car to the side, but the 
concern was showing in his face as he stopped the limo and got out, 
heading for the rear.
 
Seras seemed to be struggling to maintain some form of sanity, but 
whatever had seized her was strong.  Only with Alucard appearing next to 
her was she able to gain some measure of control.  &quot;Seras,&quot; he began, 
&quot;can you tell us what has happened to you?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m... trying, Master,&quot; the young Draculina managed to say.  &quot;It&#39;s... 
powerful whatever it is.  I&#39;ll see if I can get a better idea on what it 
is.&quot;  Calming herself, she closed her eyes and concentrated on the power 
that took control of her.
 
RALLY&#39;S CAR, AT THE SAME TIME...
 
&quot;THAT BITCH, THAT BITCH, THAT GODDAMNED BITCH!!!&quot; Rally snarled, somehow 
maintaining control of the Cobra despite her anger.  &quot;HOW DARE SHE GRAB 
MAY LIKE SHE DID!!!  GOLDIE, WHEN I GET AHOLD OF YOU, I&#39;M GOING TO KILL 
YOU, THIS TIME FOR SURE!!!&quot;
 
THE LIMOSINE, AT THE SAME TIME...
 
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Seras gasped, eyes widening.  &quot;It&#39;s Rally.&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?  Rally?&quot; Becky queried.
 
Alucard smiled.  &quot;Seras must&#39;ve felt what Miss Vincent was feeling 
through the link they share.&quot;  The smile faded as he bent over to Seras, 
&quot;Can you tell me what she&#39;s feeling?&quot;
 
Seras strained for a few seconds.  &quot;From what I can tell... May has been 
kidnapped.  Strange... I keep getting the same name over and over 
again... Goldie.&quot;  Recognizing the name, she turned to Sir Integra and 
said, &quot;I believe Goldie Muso has got May, for what I do not know.&quot;
 
&quot;It must be because that with May as a hostage, Miss Muso is in a better 
position to capture Rally,&quot; the Hellsing leader reasoned.  &quot;Seras, can 
you tell me where Rally is right now?&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry, but she&#39;s so angry, I can&#39;t get a clear picture of where she&#39;s 
going.&quot;
 
Briefly disappointed, Sir Integra then turned to Becky, who had opened 
her laptop and was now accessing the G.P.S. tracker on Rally&#39;s Cobra.  
&quot;Can you track where she...&quot;
 
&quot;You don&#39;t have to tell me twice, I&#39;m on it,&quot; Becky interrupted.  &quot;She&#39;s 
still in motion... but it appears she&#39;s headed to where there&#39;s a bunch 
of deserted warehouses near the old section of the city.&quot;  She swung the 
laptop around to show the others.
 
&quot;It&#39;s not much... but it will have to do,&quot; Sir Integra said, then turned 
to Walter and barked out, &quot;Contact Detective Coleman and tell him what 
has transpired!  We may be able to help out Rally once we learn more 
information on what has happened and of her whereabouts, but he must be 
told at once!&quot;  
 
&quot;I will do that, Sir Integra,&quot; the butler said, heading back to the 
front of the limo.
 
Seras, in the meantime, continued to try to get more information from 
her link, only to shake her head in discouragement.  &quot;Come on, Rally... 
where are you going?&quot;
 
TO BE CONTINUED...
 
Author&#39;s notes - Now the story is starting to get interesting.  May&#39;s 
been kidnapped, and Rally is not exactly thinking straight in trying to 
save her.  There is only one way this could end up... and the results 
are going to change Rally Vincent forever!
 
Also, I appreciate all the positive reviews and feedback on my story 
series so far, but I would appreciate a little input and ideas on how 
the story should progress - which would include the deepening 
relationship between Integra, Seras and Rally... and of Rally&#39;s future.
