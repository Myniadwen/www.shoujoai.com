<h1>Night Angels (part 21 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../hellsing/niteangel-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>The sun was close to setting as a taxi was waved past the gate of the 
Hellsing manor. Near the front gate, Pip Bernadotte, leader of the Wild 
Geese, watched in fascination as the vehicle made its way to the door of 
the huge mansion. As soon as the rear door opened, Moria Hedgley, 
burdened with several bags, managed to struggle out of the cab. Setting 
down the packages, she managed to pay the cabbie before resuming her 
load. &quot;&#39;Allo, Mademoiselle Moria,&quot; the one-eyed Frenchman greeted the 
struggling maid, &quot;how was your trip?&quot;

&quot;You can ask me later,&quot; Moria groaned in French, &quot;just help me out with 
these damned packages!&quot;

&quot;Oui-oui, Madam, just don&#39;t get too cranky on me!&quot; Pip then had taken a 
sizeable quantity of the packages from Moria and helped her upstairs. 
&quot;Zo,&quot; he continued, &quot;I heard zat you are going to working more with 
Mignonette and Rally, non?&quot;

The maid nodded. &quot;It seemed that Sir Integra felt that my combat skills 
were worthy of being a part-time agent within the Hellsing 
Organization,&quot; she said, &quot;And please, could you reply in your native 
tongue. I realize you can understand English but I could use the 
practice.&quot;

Pip nodded, and then noticed some of the items in one of her bags. &quot;A 
new language book... and tapes, too,&quot; he said, then looked further. &quot;So 
now it&#39;s Romanian, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Oui,&quot; Moira replied. &quot;I just looking through all the books and tapes 
they had and thought it would be an interesting one to learn.&quot;

&quot;I do recall there&#39;s one of the Geese zat is fluent in Romanian,&quot; Pip 
added. &quot;Maybe you might want to drill your progress with him, non?&quot;

&quot;I do... and if I get the nerve to even get near him, I might try with 
Alucard as well,&quot; Moria said as they got to her quarters. As soon as she 
unlocked the door, the two made there way into the room. &quot;Merci, Captain 
Bernadotte. Climbing up the stairs with all that might have caused me to 
have an accident.&quot;

&quot;I appreciate zat,&quot; the mercenary said. &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;d 
best supervise ze Geese at ze target range.&quot;

&quot;Then I won&#39;t hold you back, Captain,&quot; Moria answered. &quot;See you in the 
morning!&quot;

&quot;And you, too. Adieu,&quot; Pip repeated, closing the door as he did.

Soon afterward, Moria collapsed on the bed, weary from this afternoon&#39;s 
shopping excursion. &quot;I&#39;m glad that&#39;s over,&quot; she said to herself, careful 
not to let her thoughts run stray, least the vampire Irene &quot;Rally&quot; 
Vincent - who she was bonded to - caught them. &quot;And I still have to get 
ready for... whatever Rally and Seras has in mind downstairs.&quot; She then 
produced the language kit she purchased, looked at it and smiled. 
&quot;Still, it was pretty productive; gotten some new lingerie, as well as 
this little thing.&quot; She then glanced over to the windows, noticing the 
sun was setting. &quot;Well, no use putting things off too long.&quot; Getting up, 
she found a small bottle of a light-scented perfume, dabbed a little of 
it behind her ears, then set off for the sub-basement level.


But as she descended the stairs, Moria couldn&#39;t help but to feel a 
little nervous. Granted, this would be her second time down into the 
bowels of the mansion, but for some reason, she felt more at home down 
here - and that slightly unnerved her. &quot;I don&#39;t believe that I could 
possibly get adjusted to this place the way I have,&quot; she muttered. 
&quot;Feels like a damned dungeon to me. How in the world Rally and Seras get 
used to this place is beyond... EEEEPP!!&quot; So much she was in her own 
musings, she had nearly ran into Alucard, who was standing in front of 
her.

For a few seconds, the No-Life King did nothing, his eyes covered-up by 
his glasses. Then he smiled, which only unnerved Moria further. &quot;Well 
now,&quot; Alucard purred, &quot;headed down for your meeting, I see.&quot;

Moria gulped. &quot;Uh... yes, Mr. Alucard. I...&quot;

&quot;Please, just &#39;Alucard&#39; will do. And don&#39;t worry, I have no intention of 
harming you,&quot; the red-clad vampire said, still smiling. &quot;If I did, I 
would certainly be in a big fight with Rally Vincent. And I really don&#39;t 
have any wish to fight her, if you follow my meaning. She can be very 
vicious if she wanted to, the way her powers had grown.&quot;

Sighing in relief, Moria was able to relax, but she did ask, &quot;She... 
would?&quot;

&quot;Yes. You see, you belong to her... figuratively speaking,&quot; Alucard 
explained. &quot;In short, you are under her protection. Any other vampire 
who wishes your blood would have to have her permission to do so... and 
would think twice before trying to take it without first asking her!&quot; He 
then relaxed his stance and eyed the maid seriously. &quot;You have been 
given a unique opportunity, Moria Hedgley - the chance to learn under 
two very special vampires. I&#39;m certain my master Sir Integra has told 
you of what you might find from them.&quot;

&quot;Indeed I do,&quot; Moria said, nodding.

Alucard took an appraising look at the young girl and added, &quot;And in 
addition, you might learn firsthand what a vampire has to endure every 
night. Something to think about... if you ever wish to join Rally 
Vincent into the darkness as her fledgling.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nice that you have such faith in me,&quot; Moria began, &quot;but I&#39;m not 
certain that Rally wishes for me to become a vampire. In fact, I 
promised her I would think about the prospect first before making such a 
decision.&quot;

Alucard nodded. &quot;A wise notion, to say the least.&quot; He then sighed and 
said, &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ve got to see what my master has in 
store for me. I will see you later.&quot; He then left the maid to her own 
devices. However, as soon as she was out of earshot, he muttered, &quot;With 
all the preparations Rally and Seras are making at this moment, I hope 
the girl has a good time tonight.&quot;

Not hearing Alucard, Moria made her way through the dim corridors of the 
lower levels of the mansion until she reached the door to Rally and 
Seras&#39; quarters. Steeling her nerves, she lightly tapped on the door... 
only to find it swing open as she did! &quot;How odd,&quot; she mused.

Deciding to be brave, Moria crept inside the room. It took some time for 
her eyes to adjust to the gloom, but when they did, she could see that 
the room was apparently deserted. Quietly, she ventured further into the 
room, wondering where the vampires were. What she didn&#39;t see, though, 
were the forms of two individuals behind her, blending in the shadows.

&quot;Rally? Seras?&quot; she asked, peering into the bathroom but seeing nothing. 
&quot;Alright, this is ceasing to be funny!&quot; she growled as she returned to 
the center of the room. It was then she noticed she was not alone, 
seeing a form in front of her. Scared but not wishing to show it, she 
decided to challenge this unknown person. &quot;If you&#39;re thinking of harming 
me,&quot; she said, going into a defensive stance, &quot;then you better get to it 
now, because I&#39;m going to show you no quarter if you do!&quot;

&quot;Okay, calm down Moria,&quot; Rally&#39;s voice announced in front of her, 
stepping forward as she did. But when she came into view, it was all 
Moria could do not to faint outright! Rally was totally nude - and 
smiling in a rather seductive manner. &quot;I&#39;m just here to help celebrate 
our new arrangement.&quot;

&quot;Uh... uh... uh...&quot; Moria stammered, backpedaling away - only to be 
restrained gently by Seras, who was also nude! &quot;What in the devil!?&quot; she 
gasped.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, Moria,&quot; the Draculina purred as she began to unbutton 
the maid&#39;s top. &quot;We, along with Rally, are going to have a little fun 
together.&quot; She then nuzzled the back of Moria&#39;s neck, causing the 
brunette to shiver as she added, &quot;Besides, you did see me and Rally make 
love when we were in Roanapur.&quot;

&quot;Y-yes, but I... AHHHH!!&quot; Moria soon found her right breast being 
fondled by Seras.

Rally, in the meantime, finished what Seras had started, unbuttoning 
Moria&#39;s blouse - and catching sight at what she was wearing. &quot;Oh my,&quot; 
the dusky vampire giggled, seeing the half-cup bra, &quot;such scandalous 
undies! Even the nipples are exposed!&quot; She then kneeled and gently 
pulled-down the pants. &quot;Wonder what you&#39;ve got down here?&quot;

By now, Moria wasn&#39;t thinking clearly as Seras unhooked her bra. The 
vampires were seeing her in her most intimate manner, causing her pulse 
to race. In the meantime, Rally began to remove her thong panties. &quot;We 
better take these off before they get damp,&quot; she said... then took a 
double-take at the maid&#39;s exposed crotch. &quot;Oh my,&quot; Rally chuckled, 
&quot;looks like you shave, too... and from the looks of it, your pussy&#39;s 
almost drenched!&quot;

&quot;I... uh... I had myself waxed... just yesterday,&quot; Moria groaned, Seras 
massaging her breasts. &quot;I&#39;d rather not use a razor blade down there.&quot;

&quot;Waxed? Wow that HAD to hurt!&quot; Rally replied standing up. &quot;I think we&#39;ll 
leave the garter belt and stockings alone... they make you look better.&quot; 
Seras then backed away as Rally took Moria into her arms. &quot;You look like 
you&#39;re about to pass-out. Here, let me guide you to bed.&quot; She then led 
Moria to the coffin/bed in the center of the room.

&quot;Rally,&quot; Moria said breathlessly as Rally laid on top of her, &quot;please 
know that... this is my first time. Please... be gentle?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; the dusky vampire said, drawing closer to her face, &quot;I 
will... you cutie.&quot; She then looked over at Seras, who was seating 
herself next to the bed. &quot;What about you, Master?&quot;

&quot;Oh... I think for the time being, I&#39;ll just amuse myself by watching 
you and Moria go at it,&quot; Seras replied, pulling up a chair backwards 
beside the bed and sitting down. &quot;After all, this is her &#39;first time&#39;... 
and I think it&#39;s only fair that you do the honors, my dear Rally.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you, Master.&quot; Laying on top of Moria, she then said, &quot;So... 
do you think you can handle it, Moria?&quot;

&quot;I think I can adapt... my lovely,&quot; was the sultry reply, Moria slinging 
her arms over Rally&#39;s shoulders.

The answer that Rally made was, &quot;Alright,&quot; then she and Moria&#39;s lips 
met.

For the better part of two minutes, the two, vampire and human, kissed 
on the bed, and when they parted, their tongues still played with each 
other. At the same time, Rally&#39;s left hand kneaded Moira&#39;s left breast, 
occasionally pinching the hardened nipples gently, all the while, the 
human girl began moaning loudly.

After their tongues parted, Moria had found herself gasping, trying to 
fathom the sensations she was experiencing. &quot;Rally,&quot; she managed to say, 
&quot;that was... phenomenal!&quot; Looking deeply into the vampire&#39;s eyes, she 
added, &quot;Is that... all?&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Rally whispered, &quot;I&#39;m just getting started.&quot; She then started 
to lightly kiss Moria&#39;s body, starting at the chin and slowly working 
downward - which prompted the maid to moan louder.

As soon as Rally gotten to Moria&#39;s breasts, she taken the right nipple 
into her mouth, sucking it as her right hand began to grope at the left 
breast. Moria gasped, surprised at the electric sensations she was 
experiencing as Rally&#39;s ice-cold mouth worked its magic. &#39;Oh my god!&#39; 
she frantically thought. &#39;This... this is better than any of my 
fantasies! I&#39;m not certain I will be able to hold out!&#39;

Satisfied with the results of her ministrations, the dusky vampire 
continued downward, lightly kissing Moria&#39;s taunt stomach - briefly 
licking the naval as she did, which caused the maid to moan even louder. 
The she arrived at Moira, generously-dampening hairless crotch, sticking 
her cold finger inside the pink folds. &quot;AHHHHHH!!&quot; Moria bolted upwards, 
the sensation a powerful shock. &quot;Rally... I beg you,&quot; she cried, &quot;don&#39;t 
torture me like this!!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I have in mind... Moira dear,&quot; Rally purred, pausing 
for a bit before she began to lap at the girl&#39;s juicing slit.

&quot;YEEEEEAAAAUUUUGGGHHHH!!&quot; The feeling of Rally&#39;s cold, wet tongue upon 
her sex nearly drove Moria mad. &quot;OH GOD... OH GOD!! AUUUUGGGHHH!&quot; Every 
lap Rally had made was like a jolt of electricity to the maid. Moria&#39;s 
head began thrashing to-and-fro, gasping and screaming as she did. This 
was more powerful than any orgasm she had... and yet Moria knew she 
hadn&#39;t came yet! She was beginning to wonder if, when she did came, if 
she was going to survive the experience.

At the same time, Seras simply sat in her chair, watching Rally make 
love to Moria. She smiled, wondering how the maid was enjoying herself. 
&quot;Beautiful,&quot; she breathed. However, she did notice something about Moira 
that made her wonder. &#39;Her teeth,&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;did I see... 
fangs? That&#39;s impossible, Moria&#39;s human!&#39; She just shrugged, possibly 
discounting it to a trick of the dim light.

In the meantime, Moira had found herself bracing, preparing for the 
moment when she climaxed. She was afraid of possibly dying as a result 
of her orgasm, and yet wishing she did. She tensed up every muscle in 
her body, delaying its reaction as a result.

This activity was not lost to Rally, who noticed Moria was clenching. 
&#39;Thinking about delaying the inevitable, are you my dear?&#39; she thought 
to herself, still licking Moria&#39;s slit. &#39;Well, I&#39;ve got a solution to 
that!&#39; It turned out, during her many lovemaking sessions with Seras, 
she had discovered an ability that turned-out to be... handy in 
situations where her master was deliberately holding back. Plunging her 
tongue deep into Moria, she then stretched it, covering the full length 
of the maid&#39;s love canal - until she reached the cervix. When she found 
her target, she then touched the tip of her tongue firmly against it - 
and into Moria&#39;s womb!

That did it! Feeling Rally&#39;s cold tongue plunging deeply into the core 
of her womanhood caused Moria to lose control. Eyes wide, she suddenly 
arched her back, at the same time spraying her secretions into the 
vampire&#39;s face. &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot; The power of Moria&#39;s orgasm 
was phenomenal - as if every nerve in her body short-circuited!

It lasted over ten seconds, afterwhich Moria collapsed on the bed, eyes 
still wide and a trail of drool coming from her panting mouth. Seras 
looked closely at Moria&#39;s mouth, examining her teeth. Sure enough, no 
fangs... but still, the Draculina wondered what was it she saw.

&quot;Moria... are you alright?&quot; Rally finally said, her face still wet from 
the maid&#39;s climax. She began to look concerned, not seeing a reaction 
from Moria. Instead, she saw a blank look on her face, with no apparent 
expression Rally can see. &quot;MORIA... ANSWER ME!!&quot; Rally was beginning to 
wonder if she had driven her insane.

Then finally, a smile crept over Moria&#39;s features, at the same time 
tears began streaming from her eyes. Finally acknowledging her lover, 
she looked into her eyes and gasped, &quot;Rally... that was... the most 
wonderful thing that you did!&quot; She then began sobbing as she drew Rally 
in for a kiss, delighting in the taste of her passion. Finally calming 
down, she added, &quot;If you and Seras can do that EVERY night... it will be 
worth it!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you liked it,&quot; Rally replied, &quot;but you did have me worried for 
a bit. You really went-off like a shot! I was a little concerned that I 
may have fried your brains!&quot;

Then Moria turned Rally on her back, saying, &quot;Thank you for your 
concerns, my lovely,&quot; she purred. &quot;Now let me show you my gratitude.&quot; 
Almost immedietly, she had repeated what Rally had done to her, slowly 
making her way down to Rally&#39;s crotch. Upon reaching it, she placed her 
fingers inside the two rings that pierced her labia, spreading them as 
she did. &#39;So THAT&#39;S what they&#39;re for! Rally, you are a naughty one, 
that&#39;s for sure!&#39; Smiling, she then began to lap at the pink folds that 
were exposed.

&quot;UHH... MORIA, ARE YOU... UHH... SURE THIS IS YOUR FIRST... OHH... 
TIME?&quot; Rally managed to gasp, surprised at the unusual ease Moria was 
working her magic. &quot;YOU&#39;RE... YOU&#39;RE... A NATURAL, THAT&#39;S FOR CERTAIN!!&quot;

For about ten seconds, Rally endured an apparently gifted Moria&#39;s 
lovemaking, blissfully ignorant about her master&#39;s whereabouts - until 
she noticed Seras strattled over her face. &quot;I know you&#39;re busy at the 
moment, Rally,&quot; the Draculina purred, spreading her labia, &quot;but do you 
have a little time for me?&quot; Rally didn&#39;t answer, instead grasping Seras&#39; 
hips and beginning to service her.

For the next hour and a half, the three women had done just about every 
lesbian sex act ever known - and possibly inventing a few new ones on 
the spot! So it wasn&#39;t any surprised that after such an aerobic and 
vigorous sex session that the three had laid down together, Moria 
in-between the two vampires. The maid then decided to break the silence 
between them and said, &quot;You know... I was a little surprised that you 
two haven&#39;t gotten a chance to sample my blood yet.&quot;

Rally thought for a moment. &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure you wanted to, Moria,&quot; she 
replied.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve talked to Dr. Trevelyan last week. I told him what I wanted 
and he approved, provided I increase my iron intake to rebuild my blood 
afterwards,&quot; Moria said. &quot;I&#39;ve been taking vitamin supplements, and I 
have increased by intake on spinach salad. So I&#39;m saying it&#39;s alright if 
you and Seras sample my blood.&quot;

&quot;I guess if the doctor approves,&quot; Seras replied, &quot;then I think it would 
be alright... but I have to ask Rally first, since she&#39;s under your 
protection.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind, Master,&quot; Rally said. Then turning her attention to Moria, 
she added, &quot;I&#39;ll only take a little. Remember, you still got your 
promise to me.&quot;

&quot;I remember,&quot; the maid replied, craning her neck up.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll take a... different approach, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; Seras 
smirked.

Then gently, Rally sunk her fangs into Moria&#39;s neck, causing the maid to 
gasp slightly. At the same time, Seras bent down, taking the maid&#39;s left 
breast into her hands and bit carefully into the inside. Both vampires 
took only a couple swallows, then licked the wounds to seal them. 
Recovering slightly, Moria smiled at the two - only to be surprised as 
both of them left the bed. &quot;Wait, where are you going?&quot; she asked, 
wondering if she did something wrong.

&quot;We still have to go to work, Moria,&quot; Seras said, smiling. &quot;After all, 
me and Rally still work here.&quot;

&quot;Hey don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Rally added, kissing Moria&#39;s cheek. &quot;We&#39;ll 
be back when the sun rises and pick-up where we left off from.&quot; She then 
pressed the switch on the bed&#39;s lid, causing it to close slowly. &quot;You 
don&#39;t mind sleeping in a coffin, do you?&quot;


&quot;Uh... no,&quot; Moria muttered, suddenly realizing a minor complication in 
the working arrangements she now had with the vampires.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about your uniform,&quot; Rally added. &quot;I&#39;ll ask Walter if I can 
bring your change in. There&#39;s a shower and tub in here when you need 
it.&quot; The lid then closed, Rally concluding telepathically, &#39;See you!&#39;

&#39;Yes... see you.&#39; Moria then made herself comfortable inside the 
coffin/bed, drawing the covers over her. &#39;Well,&#39; she thought to herself, 
&#39;looks like in the morning I&#39;m going to have to have a little talk with 
the lady... mostly about adjusting my schedule.&#39;

SIR INTEGRA FAIRBROOK WINGATES HELLSING&#39;S OFFICE, THE NEXT MORNING...

&quot;I do not quite follow what you mean, Moria?&quot; the Hellsing leader asked, 
seated at her desk sorting through the latest paperwork.

&quot;Sir Integra, I kindly request that you adjust my hours to accommodate 
my newest duties,&quot; Moira repeated, dressed in her maid&#39;s uniform and 
standing in front of Sir Integra&#39;s desk. &quot;You see, I found out 
during...&quot; she blushed slightly, &quot;a rather involved discourse between 
Rally and Seras last night... and early this morning that the schedule I 
have is in direct conflict with my duties to them.&quot;

&quot;In what way?&quot; Sir Integra implored, having a faint idea about what 
Moria meant by &#39;discourse&#39;.

Moria composed herself, carefully choosing her words before continuing. 
&quot;Vampires are nocturnal: the night is their natural habitat. Humans like 
myself, however, exist in the daylight, and as a result have to sleep 
during the night, which would diminish greatly my ability to aid them in 
the night.&quot; Straightening herself, she added, &quot;In order to be most 
effective, I must become nocturnal. Therefore, my first request is that 
my duties be moved to the evening - the time which vampires are most 
active.&quot;

Sir Integra thought for a bit. &quot;That does not seem unreasonable. I 
believe I can have Walter adjust your schedule for the nighttime hours.&quot; 
However, she did add, &quot;But I wonder how you will be able to sleep during 
the daylight hours. Your room in the mansion is quite bright, and it 
could make sleeping difficult.&quot;

&quot;Which brings me to my second request,&quot; Moria replied. &quot;I wish my 
quarters to be moved into the sub-basement level - in Rally and Seras&#39; 
room.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Sir Integra&#39;s eyebrows raised. &quot;Are you certain you wish to 
endure such an environment? The sub-basements are not exactly the best 
place for someone like you. They are a bit cold and damp... not to 
mention you may have to endure meeting up with Alucard from 
time-to-time.&quot;

Moria smile wryly. &quot;I believe I can adapt,&quot; she said. &quot;So, do you 
accept?&quot;

&quot;Indeed I do, Moria,&quot; Sir Integra said. &quot;I will have the Wild Geese move 
your belongings immedietly, although it would be very clumsy to move 
your bed there as well.&quot;

&quot;That will not be necessary,&quot; Moria said. &quot;I spent the last night in 
Rally and Seras&#39; coffin. It&#39;s not that bad, actually. It&#39;s roomy and 
quiet, so I think I can be of no trouble.&quot;

&#39;Somehow, I have the odd feeling that is NOT the only reason why she 
would make such an unusual request,&#39; the Hellsing leader thought to 
herself, suppressing a smile. &quot;Very well, when do you wish to start your 
new schedule?&quot;

&quot;Tonight, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; answered Moria.

&quot;So be it, then.&quot; Sir Integra then made a few notations, then added, 
&quot;Now if you do not mind, I have an impossible amount of work to do 
here.&quot; She indicated to the &#39;in&#39; box, which had a sizable amount of 
paperwork on it. &quot;And I am afraid that it will only grow larger if I do 
not address it.&quot;

&quot;Then I won&#39;t delay you any further,&quot; Moira said, bowing before leaving 
the office.

XXX

For the remainder of the day, Walter C. Dolnez had supervised a group of 
the Wild Geese into moving Moria&#39;s belongings to the room shared by 
Rally and Seras. Of course, Moria had to quickly pack her intimate wear 
and moved them in ahead of time, not only because she wanted to spare 
herself the embarrassment of having Pip Bernadotte&#39;s men see her 
treasured scanties, but mainly because she didn&#39;t want the Geese - or 
their perverted leader for that matter - to take a few &#39;souvenirs&#39; with 
them afterwards. In any case, not only her clothes, but some of her 
treasured mementos were quickly moved inside the spacious confines of 
the room of Rally and Seras with plenty of room to spare.

Taking a rest upon the chair after the last box was placed on the floor, 
Moria decided to take stock in her new surroundings. She looked upon a 
shelf on the wall and giggled at the plush panda Rally owned, the fuzzy 
toy dressed in a Chicago Cubs home uniform. There were also several 
pictures from Rally&#39;s previous life as a bounty hunter, mostly of Rally 
and her friends. She even noticed a picture of a nine year-old Seras and 
her parents, then remembering the tragic events the Draculina had 
related to her about their deaths. Looking around her stacked boxes, she 
looked at the clock that was near the coffin/bed. Judging from the time, 
she realized it was almost sunset. &quot;Well, almost time for them to get 
up,&quot; Moria said to herself, standing up from the chair.

However, a small knock on the door distracted her. Opening it, she found 
Walter standing there, a cart with two units of blood cooling on ice. 
&quot;Oh there you are, Miss Hedgley. Still recovering from your move?&quot;

&quot;Quite so, Mr. Dolnez,&quot; Moira answered. &quot;So, you have Rally and Seras&#39; 
rations?&quot;

Walter nodded. &quot;Indeed I have,&quot; he said, wheeling the cart inside and 
placing the rations on the table, as well as two bowls. &quot;I suspect they 
might not be needing these, but it is best to be prepared as well.&quot; He 
then handed a note to Moria. &quot;Also, I have this from Sir Integra... 
official orders giving Miss Victoria and Miss Vincent the night off, 
presumably to aid you in getting your things in order, as well as... 
other matters afterwards.&quot;

This disclosure made Moria blush, saying, &quot;I believe I will... let them 
know about it, Mr. Dolnez.&quot;

&quot;Then I will leave the matters to you,&quot; Walter concluded, bowing. &quot;Well, 
I will be leaving you right now. Until tomorrow night, then?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Moria replied, bowing in turn.

Just as Walter left the room and the door was closed, the lid of the 
coffin/bed chose that moment to open, the two vampires inside awakening. 
Rally was the first to rise, stretching - then taking a double-take at 
the boxes lying around the room. &quot;Hey!&quot; she sputtered, &quot;What the hell is 
going on?&quot;

&quot;It looks like someone&#39;s turned this place into some storage locker of 
something,&quot; Seras added, also bewildered.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about all that,&quot; Moria said, reassuring the two. &quot;This 
is all my stuff. Starting today, I&#39;m moving in with you two.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re kidding?&quot; Rally asked, scratching her head. &quot;You... move into a 
damp, musty dungeon... with two potentially dangerous vampires?&quot;

&quot;Now don&#39;t be jesting,&quot; Moria pouted. &quot;I don&#39;t think you two are that 
dangerous. That is... if you count being in bed with you is what you 
mean!&quot; She then added with a playful smirk, &quot;You two had me screaming 
last night and this morning; I wasn&#39;t certain I would have the stamina 
to get all this done this afternoon. As for the dampness... well, I have 
brought a couple of dehumidifiers downstairs that should help.&quot;

Seras decided to look around the assorted boxes, saying, &quot;I guess it 
wouldn&#39;t be too bad, Rally. However, this could be a couple of days 
work, being you might be alone while me and Rally are working.&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about that,&quot; said Moria, presenting Seras and Rally the 
letter. &quot;Sir Integra said that you two could have the night off. Also, I 
requested to work the night shift, so that I can be more of a help to 
you.&quot;

Rally took a look at the note, then at the various boxes, as well as a 
couple of dressers and wardrobes added. &quot;Looks like everything&#39;s in 
order. I guess we can help you get unpacked and set-up. But even with 
our help, that still means we still have at least four hours to kill 
before the next sunrise.&quot;

&quot;I anticipated that,&quot; Moria said, &quot;and afterwards... I don&#39;t believe I&#39;m 
going to say this,&quot; she added, blushing, &quot;I want you two to shag me 
until the sun rises!&quot;

Both Rally and Seras blink in surprise. &quot;Man... that is a stretch, you 
saying that,&quot; Rally quipped.

&quot;Are you certain you have the strength to last that long?&quot; the Draculina 
added. &quot;I recall last night and this morning you almost passed-out from 
the stress!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Moria answered, then she embraced both vampires. &quot;What I 
had experienced was greater than any dream and fantasy I could ever 
have. Besides,&quot; she further said, a seductive look in her eyes, &quot;I don&#39;t 
believe no human girl could possibly hold a candle to you two.&quot;

Still embracing Moria, Rally and Seras took an appraising look at the 
maid before replying telepathically, &#39;She does mean well, Rally, 
although I still am a little worried about harming the girl shagging 
her.&#39;

&#39;Wouldn&#39;t blame you there, Master... but at least she can dish it out as 
well as she can take it. I say we take her upon it,&#39; Rally answered.

&#39;But still, I like to err on the side of caution in regards to sex, 
until she is used to our level of play.&#39; A sly look came over the 
Draculina&#39;s face as she added, &#39;We DO still have our toy box. I guess it 
wouldn&#39;t hurt to... gradually bring her up to our level. You still have 
your strap-on?&#39;

Rally smirked, bringing Moira closer to them. &#39;You know I always do,&#39; 
was all she said.
