<a href="../hellsing/niteangel-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>THE HELLSING MANSION, ONE WEEK LATER...

Moria Hedgley left the shower of her quarters, feeling refreshed and 
ready for the new day. Still wrapped in her towel, she selected her 
clothing from the wardrobe - which was her very conservative 
long-sleeved, long-skirted maid&#39;s uniform, which was a natural for her. 
When you are a domestic servant working for one of the most-prestigious 
families in England - that family being the Hellsing family, appearance 
was everything. She inspected her uniform before hanging it on a coat 
hanger near her bed. Then she inspected it again, making sure there were 
no hidden tears or misplaced threads on it.

However, once her inspection was complete, Moria then went to a dresser 
near her wardrobe and mulled over what she often referred to as &#39;her 
secret vice&#39; - which contained inside was some very racy and seductive 
lingerie. To Moria, it was her own way to telling herself that, while 
she may be a lesbian, she was also a very feminine woman. She took great 
care in choosing what she would wear this day: white thigh-high 
stockings, a pair of lacy white thong panties and matching garter belt, 
and a low-cut white half-cup bra which exposed her nipples of her large 
breasts - all of which would be concealed by her uniform and apron. 
&#39;After all,&#39; she thought wryly to herself, &#39;no one else has to know but 
myself... well, maybe Rally,&#39; fondly remembering her link to the vampire 
Irene &#39;Rally&#39; Vincent. Once she was satisfied with her uniform and 
choice of underwear, she dressed herself.

Securing the white cuffs of her black uniform, Moira then made her way 
to the servants&#39; break room, where she would look-up her duties for the 
day. But this time, instead of the day&#39;s chores being posted on the 
bulletin board, the duties were handed-out personally by Walter C. 
Dolnez, the Hellsing family butler. &#39;Now that&#39;s odd,&#39; she thought to 
herself as Walter handed out responsibilities. &#39;Usually, Mr. Dolnez 
always posts the duties on the board. Why in the world would he do it 
personally?&#39;

&quot;Miss Hedgley?&quot; Walter said, &quot;have you been paying attention?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Moria then realized she was so into her own thoughts she missed 
her assignment. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Dolnez. It&#39;s just that... well... 
you never make the assignments in person.&quot;

&quot;Understandable, Miss Hedgley,&quot; the Hellsing butler said. &quot;However, 
sometimes one has to vary the routine just to keep the staff on their 
toes. Now that is taken care of, as for your assignment, you are to work 
on the third floor today, as well as serving Sir Integra tea during her 
meeting this afternoon.&quot;

&quot;Pardon me for asking, Mr. Dolnez, but why me?&quot; Moria asked. &quot;Isn&#39;t it 
you that does that duty?&quot;

&quot;Normally yes,&quot; Walter said, &quot;but I have to brief Sir Integra on 
information from the Roanapur mission. Now that the assignments have 
been handed-out, let us get going.&quot;

Almost as one, the staff departed the break room. However, Walter soon 
called-out, &quot;Miss Hedgley, another word if I may.&quot;

Moria turned around, mystified, &quot;Yes?&quot; she asked.

Before he could answer, Walter made sure the staff had left the room, 
then closed the door. Then stepping close to the maid, he said, &quot;I just 
need to let you know that the meeting Sir Integra will be having does 
involve very sensitive information. I must ask you not to reveal 
anything you might hear.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Moria said thoughtfully. &quot;Well, since I was involved in part 
with the whole affair, it&#39;s easy to understand. Don&#39;t worry, I will 
treat this in strict confidence.&quot;

&quot;Nice to hear,&quot; Walter said, &quot;Well, off to work then.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Thank you, Mr. Dolnez.&quot;

Satisfied with the assignments, Moria then made her way upstairs to the 
third level of the mansion. For the last week, though, her workload has 
been light, mostly because she was still recovering from the slight 
fracture in her right hand, as evident by the hand brace she wore, as 
well as giving her blood to Rally. In her consultation with Dr. 
Trevelyan upon their return from Roanapur, he approved of her proposal 
of occasionally giving some of her blood to Rally and Seras Victoria, 
provided she adjust her diet to allow for her blood to recover. Moria 
couldn&#39;t be happier. As for her diet, she adored spinach salad and ate 
plenty of it, as well as taking iron supplements.

However, neither Rally nor Seras had approached her, so she figured that 
they were taking their time before asking for her blood. &#39;I guess they 
think I still need to recover,&#39; she thought to herself as she began 
dusting the paintings. For the first part of the day, Moria worked 
peacefully, either by dusting or vacuuming the floors of the third 
floor. Occasionally, she checked her watch, being mindful of the meeting 
she had to serve tea there later on.

But all of a sudden, something intruded upon her mind. Unusual, powerful 
images began flooding into Moria&#39;s head, many of them including Sir 
Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, Alucard, Rally and Seras - 
nightmare images which included a burning London, many of the Wild Geese 
dying in battle by the hands of a muscular tattooed woman, as well as a 
transformed Seras; she was wearing a uniform the color of blood, as well 
as a mass of writhing shadows in place of her left arm - and most 
bizarre of all, Rally bowing before the changed Draculina like a knight 
before his queen.

Moria stumbled backward, reeling from the visions she was having. 
&#39;What... what just happened?&#39; she thought in a panic. &#39;Those images... 
they&#39;ve seem so real! I could even smell the spilled blood in the air! 
And Rally and Seras... what does those images mean!?&#39;


Then a loud yawn brought her back to reality. Turning around, she found 
Rally right behind her - with her hands positioned parallel to the level 
of Moria&#39;s huge breasts, ready to grab them. Rally also had a sheepish 
grin on her face, like a child whose hand was caught in the cookie jar. 
&quot;Eh-heh-heh-heh. Er... hi, Moria, how are you doing... this afternoon?&quot; 
she meekly said.

&quot;Humph! Really Rally Vincent, you should be ashamed of yourself!&quot; Moria 
said, smiling. &quot;Your master Seras did warn me of that rather perverted 
habit of yours! I mean really, sneaking up and coping a feel from 
behind! It&#39;s amazing Seras hadn&#39;t disciplined you for doing it to her.&quot; 
She then did something she wouldn&#39;t have done months before - she 
stepped up and hugged Rally gently. &quot;At least you could&#39;ve asked first, 
my dear Rally,&quot; she added warmly. &quot;I would&#39;ve let you if you did.&quot;

&quot;Uhh... yeah,&quot; Rally bashfully said. &quot;Dangit, why did Master have to 
tell you that? That takes all the fun out of it!&quot; She then yawned again.

&quot;You seem to be up with the birds, Rally,&quot; Moira implored.

Rally let herself out of the embrace, stretched and said, &quot;Yeah, Integra 
wanted me at the meeting. She said that Walter may have some clues about 
what Radinov had said to me last week.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, this &#39;Millennium&#39; she mentioned before she burned up.&quot;

Rally nodded. &quot;Right. Anyway, I wanted to talk to her for a bit before 
the meeting, so I got myself up earlier than usual. Nice of Walter to 
thaw a unit before I got up.&quot;

All during this, Moria just listened on, nodding every once in a while 
at some small fact she mentioned. But all of a sudden, the earlier 
visions again intruded upon the maid&#39;s mind, only more powerful than 
ever... so powerful that she collapsed to her knees as she tried to take 
control of the images, clenching her head.

&quot;MORIA!!&quot; Rally went to her knees herself, steadying the maid as she 
cradled Moria in her arms. Curious, she used the link between them to 
figure out what was going on, her orange-red eyes widening as she caught 
sight of the fading visions. &quot;Hey, are you alright?&quot; she finally said.

&quot;I... I think,&quot; Moria muttered, Rally helping her back to her feet. &quot;I 
suppose you already know what happened, with the link and all.&quot; Rally 
nodded. &quot;So strange... I could even discern smells within the visions.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Rally thought for a bit. &quot;I already know about your past dreams, 
but this is something different. I wonder if my bite must&#39;ve triggered 
some laden psychic ability within you.&quot;

&quot;But the visions... they were so horrible!&quot; Moria said, trembling. 
&quot;Could I be seeing some sort of future in store for us... and what about 
Seras? What is this... transformation I witnessed?&quot;

&quot;Beats me,&quot; answered Rally. &quot;Look, I&#39;ve got to get inside the office and 
talk to Integra. Just don&#39;t worry about them for now, but I may have to 
mention this to her, just in case.&quot;

&quot;I hope she&#39;ll understand,&quot; replied Moria, who resumed her cleaning 
while Rally walked through the doors to the office inside.

For the remainder of the time before the meeting, Moria continued to 
work on the third floor, cleaning the windows in the hallways. Then a 
beeping came over from the dumb-waiter at the end of the hall. Putting 
away her supplies, she made her way to the door, then swiped her I.D. 
card before entering the code. The system was put-in after the Valentine 
Brothers&#39; attack, to keep any force from using the dumb-waiter for 
access. Sure enough, when she opened the door, a pot of Earl Gray was 
waiting, steaming. But she was surprised to see four sets of cups as 
well. &quot;I wonder what these extra sets are for?&quot; she asked herself. She 
knew that Sir Integra, and possibly Rally would be drinking tea - but 
the extra cups were a mystery to her. Deciding not to think too much 
about it, she placed the tea and cups on top of a nearby cart, then 
proceeded to the office, where she was greeted by Walter, who was 
carrying a number of file folders.

&quot;Ah, you are early, Miss Hedgley,&quot; the old butler said. &quot;Good. Then we 
can proceed.&quot;

Moria just nodded as Walter opened the doors. At the end of the room, 
Sir Integra was engaged in a conversation with Rally. The vampire was 
seated away from the windows, mostly to avoid the sunlight. &quot;I think 
that is also a wonderful idea, Rally,&quot; the Hellsing leaders said. 
&quot;However, I wonder how you are to approach Alucard with that?&quot;

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t care what that jerk thinks!&quot; Rally countered. &quot;I&#39;m just glad 
you&#39;re picking-up the license to the set.&quot;

&quot;I figured it was about time you approached me with that. Oh Walter,&quot; 
Sir Integra said, finally acknowledging the butler and Moria, &quot;Rally had 
approached me about a television in her quarters. We came to an 
agreement upon the matter: she will purchase the set while I will pay 
for the license. I was wondering if you would be as kind as to help her 
set it up?&quot;

&quot;I think I heard her mention that,&quot; Walter replied. &quot;I did offer to help 
install it, upon your approval that is.&quot;

&quot;Good. Nice to see you too, Miss Hedgley,&quot; Sir Integra said. &quot;As soon as 
the tea is poured, I am wondering if you will join us as we review that 
Walter had found.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; Moria gasped.

&quot;Of course. After all, you were present during the Roanapur affair. I 
would value your input about it.&quot; Sir Integra also added, &quot;Besides, I 
need to talk to you after this briefing. It is not that you are in 
trouble, mind you. There are just a few... things I would like to 
discuss.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Sir Integra,&quot; Moria said, beginning to serve the tea. &#39;I 
wonder what Sir Integra would like to discuss with me?&#39; she thought to 
herself.

&#39;Wouldn&#39;t you like to know?&#39; Rally added mentally. Moria just gave the 
vampire a dirty look but said nothing, instead handing her cup to her.

&quot;Now that we have gotten that taken care of,&quot; Sir Integra began, &quot;it is 
time we got down to the reason why all of us are here... namely the 
identity of this &#39;Millennium&#39; that Natasha Radinov had warned us about. 
What have you found, Walter?&quot;

&quot;I am afraid not very much,&quot; the butler began. &quot;We were able to make 
inquiries through MI-5, as well as accessing the resources of the C.I.A. 
in the United States, as well as resources of the British Library. So 
far, we were able to find at least 10,513 references to the name, as 
well as the identities of 380 doomsday cults around the world, as well 
as a &#39;Star Wars&#39; fan database in Los Angeles, California.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Rally mused.

&quot;Yes, why &#39;Star Wars&#39;?&quot; Sir Integra added.

Walter looked a bit embarrassed as he said, &quot;It refers to the Millennium 
Falcon, Han Solo&#39;s ship.&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; Rally grumbled. &quot;I got up at an hour that is terrible to 
vampires like me just to hear that bitch Radinov gave us a worthless 
clue!&quot;

&quot;I do apologize for getting up this early, Rally. However, I do not 
believe that Radinov felt it was worthless, if she risked so much to 
give us this clue.&quot; Sir Integra again turned to Walter and asked, &quot;Is 
there anything more you can give us, old friend?&quot;

&quot;I am afraid not, Sir Integra,&quot; Walter answered. &quot;The only other thing I 
can relate is the meaning of the word - the span of one thousand years.&quot;

Sir Integra just nodded, feeling just as frustrated as Rally. Then, 
while mulling over the question, a look of discovery came over her face. 
&quot;Now that IS something!&quot; she said.

&quot;I beg your pardon, Sir Integra?&quot; Walter inquired.

Rally attention was also grabbed. &quot;You figured it out, Integra?&quot; she 
added.

&quot;Indeed I have!&quot; Sir Integra then got up from her chair, lit her cigar 
and said, &quot;You know, it is any wonder you do not remember, Walter. What 
I am talking about is the Army of the Millennium... the order that 
sought-out the glory of an empire lasting for a thousand years, so much 
so that they plunged this world into a massive war!&quot;

&quot;My God!&quot; Moria gasped. &quot;Sir Integra... you don&#39;t mean...?&quot;

&quot;I do... the Third Reich of Adolf Hitler!&quot; Sir Integra declared.

For a few seconds, the silence within the room was so deep, you can hear 
a pin dropped. It took a while for Walter to say, &quot;Now I remember what 
you are talking about, Sir Integra!&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about, Walter?&quot; Rally asked.

&quot;It was a long time ago... near the end of the war,&quot; Walter began. &quot;Sir 
Arthur, Sir Integra&#39;s father, had learned of a facility in Warsaw that 
was in the process of creating artificial vampires and had sent myself 
and Alucard to deal with it. It was during the last days of the uprising 
in the Jewish Ghetto there, and both of us had managed to destroy the 
facility and as much of the records there. I do recall we both faced 
considerable resistance there from several of the SS officers there, but 
we both dealt with them with moderate trouble.&quot;

&quot;Now hold on for a minute?&quot; Rally interrupted. &quot;Are you telling me we 
may be dealing with a bunch of Nazis? This sounds ridiculous!&quot;

&quot;Perhaps, Rally... but this theory sounds plausible,&quot; Sir Integra 
replied. &quot;Walter, until we obtain information to confirm what Radinov 
had revealed, I suggest we wait out this... Millennium. Perhaps, if we 
find where they might be, then finally we could take this battle to 
them!&quot;

&quot;A good suggestion, Sir Integra,&quot; Walter said.

&quot;But it&#39;s so disturbing,&quot; Moria added. &quot;Sir Integra, do you believe we 
stand a chance against Millennium where and when we confront them?&quot;

&quot;Unknown, Miss Hedgley,&quot; the Hellsing leader said. &quot;Well, with that 
done, I believe we can call this meeting concluded.&quot;

&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; Rally said, stretching as she got up. &quot;If nobody 
minds, I&#39;m going back downstairs to my coffin and Master. Catch you 
later Integra, Moria.&quot;

&quot;You too, Rally,&quot; Moria said, but then added mentally, &#39;Although I do 
wish you wouldn&#39;t pry into my private thoughts!&#39;

&#39;Sorry, couldn&#39;t be helped,&#39; Rally replied. &#39;Because of our link, I tend 
to pick up stray thoughts. Hope I didn&#39;t embarrass you, Moria.&#39;

&#39;No really, but it&#39;s so annoying!&#39; Moria then gathered-up the dishes 
before settling herself down near Sir Integra&#39;s desk. &quot;So, what is it 
you want? Have I done anything to offend you?&quot;

&quot;None whatsoever,&quot; Sir Integra answered, &quot;but I am curious about a few 
things about you.&quot; She took an appraising look at the maid and 
continued. &quot;From what I have observed first-hand, and from reports I 
received from Seras and Rally, you should be somewhere else but here. 
You have excellent marksmanship skills, your martial arts are top-rate,&quot; 
she then held up a sheet of paper, &quot;and from this e-mail I got from Mr. 
Okajima, you are a first-class linguist! Clearly, you could be one of 
the Hellsing Organizations finest agents!&quot; Then eyeing Moria closely, 
she asked, &quot;So why are you wasting it all by being a maid?&quot;

Moria was surprised. &#39;She IS serious!&#39; she thought. Taking a sip of tea, 
she took a deep breath and said, &quot;Well quite frankly, Sir Integra, I did 
not believe that my skill were even worth mentioning. My shooting and 
fighting skills were mostly my grandfather&#39;s idea, mostly so that I 
could defend myself from those who would find that I am a lesbian 
offensive. Regarding my language skills, I only thought of it as a 
hobby. And for the last... well, I enjoy being a maid! Preparing meals, 
cleaning, dusting... I just enjoy keeping a tidy house. I really don&#39;t 
think I&#39;m THAT special.&quot;

Sir Integra just shook her head, smiling. &quot;Oh how wrong you are. In my 
line of work, I have to look for individuals who excel in many fields, 
despite how they may feel about themselves.&quot; She then leaned closer as 
she added, &quot;But I do know you are right about your work as a domestic 
servant. You do seem to enjoy yourself, despite the difficulty of some 
of your tasks. So if you do not mind, I would like to propose a 
compromise.&quot;

&quot;A compromise?&quot; Moria repeated.

&quot;I would like you to act as a part-time agent to the organization,&quot; Sir 
Integra began. &quot;You will work exclusively with Seras and Rally on their 
assignments, as well as learn from them.&quot; She then got up, walked around 
the desk and faced the maid. &quot;Seras has the knowledge and training from 
her time with the London police that you may find to your advantage. 
Also, there is Rally&#39;s know-how with firearms to consider. And from what 
I observed, you are seemingly getting along with those two vampires... 
if I am not mistaken, almost to the point of being lovers.&quot; She smiled 
as she saw Moria blush. She then took the maid&#39;s hands into hers and 
asked, &quot;So I ask you Miss Hedgley... no, I ask you, Moria, will you 
please consider this compromise? If you do, you would do your 
grandfather, Commander Farguson, a great service.&quot;

&#39;Grandfather...&#39; Moria thought wistfully, her eyes tearing up. Then 
drying them off, she looked Sir Integra in the eyes and said in a firm 
voice, &quot;Yes... I will consider your kind offer, Sir Integra! It would be 
my honor!&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Sir Integra then sighed and added, &quot;You have been working 
hard since our return to England. I suggest you take a couple of days 
off with pay, starting imminently.&quot;

&quot;W-why thank you, Sir Integra!&quot; Moria then looked at the tea set and 
added, &quot;But what about...?&quot;

&quot;Oh I will have Walter take care of that, so I would not worry too much 
about it,&quot; Sir Integra replied. &quot;I suggest you get yourself ready 
for...&quot; she blushed slightly as she said, &quot;whatever the following days 
take you.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes I will! Thank you!&quot; the maid said, bowing slightly as she left 
the office.

As the doors closed behind the maid, Sir Integra then turned around to 
face the window. &#39;Believe me, Moria, I am certain Rally and Seras would 
appreciate it.&#39; But then her face betrayed a grim look as she added, 
&#39;But what about this new threat before us? What will this... Millennium 
throw at us now?&#39;

XXX

It took a few minutes before Moria had discarded her uniform and gotten 
dressed in a pair of knit jeans and a button-down short-sleeve blouse. 
Since it was still afternoon, she planned to got out to Harrods&#39;s and do 
a bit of shopping. &#39;I have to admit,&#39; she thought, &#39;it&#39;s all a bit 
sudden... but since the lady says it&#39;s okay, I might as well take 
advantage of the rest of the day!&#39;

&#39;Way to go, Moria!&#39; Rally&#39;s voice repeated in her head.

&#39;Oh, you again?&#39; Moria quipped. &#39;Oh well, I guess no harm done. Well 
Rally, it looks as if you, I and Seras are going to be working together! 
You wouldn&#39;t have anything to do with this, wouldn&#39;t you?&#39;

&#39;Who me? Oh I just gave Integra a few suggestions, that&#39;s all.&#39; There 
was a pause before Rally continued, &#39;Hey Moria, I was wondering if you 
would come down to me and Master&#39;s quarters after you get back?&#39;

&#39;Why certainly, Rally... but... what about...&#39;

&#39;Oh are you thinking about Master?&#39; said Rally. &#39;Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;ll be 
here, too. Now why don&#39;t you get shopping?&#39;

&#39;I&#39;ll do just that. And I will see you tonight.&#39; Taking the time to get 
on a little light make-up, Moria then made sure she had her billfold and 
took off.

TO BE CONTINUED IN &#39;INTERLUDE&#39;...

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE: And thus ends &#39;Old Acquaintances&#39;... but NOT the end of 
the storyline! I have to admit, this was one of the longest &#39;Night 
Angels&#39; stories I had written so far. And now we&#39;ve got a new angel, 
Moria to the cast, who made up most of this chapter. Let me know what 
you think of her.

Until next time... LATER!!
