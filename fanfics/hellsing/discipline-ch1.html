<h1>Discipline</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ppain.html">Princess of Pain</a><br> </h2>
<pre>She sits up in the bed when I walk into the room.  Her hair is a mass 
of gold-red thistle about her face.  Inhuman red eyes look at me with 
concern, despite the dried blood that rests on her lips and rusts on 
her chin.  &quot;Are you...&quot; she murmurs.

In response, I stare at her breasts.  They are lovely in the darkness.  
I think of the way her legs tremble and spread when I take them in my 
hands, and how my lips teasing and suckling makes her body arch and 
her voice box form the syllables of my name in the manner of a scream.  
My hand also wanders to the small, perfect white rectangle of bandage 
on my neck.

She reaches down and shyly picks up the bed sheet, draping it over her 
body.  Oh, come now, my child.  What&#39;s a little nakedness between 
fuck-partners?

&quot;Whore.&quot;

The word might as well be a knife.  Her eyes are begging me for mercy.  
&quot;Please--&quot;

&quot;Whore.  Slut.  Bitch.  Vampire cunt.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t--&quot;

&quot;Think?  I believe so.  Are you stupid?  Are you of no use to me, 
other than your trigger finger and your pussy?  Wasn&#39;t the first thing 
I said to you--the first thing--&#39;don&#39;t start sucking blood&#39;?  The 
second you do that, you are no longer one of Hellsing&#39;s special 
forces.  You are a target.  And you took my blood... of all people&#39;s.  
Would you like for me to kill you myself?  Or shall I send for 
Alucard?  He might be &#39;occupied&#39;, shall we say, with his little 
Shinegami.  I guarantee that he will be upset at being interrupted.&quot;

Ruby eyes expand in fear.  &quot;N-n-no!  It was, I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t 
know I was doing it.  I would never hurt you.&quot;

&quot;When was the last time you actually ate what was given to you?&quot;

Long silence.  I knew she wouldn&#39;t know.

&quot;Whom do you call master, little whore?&quot;

&quot;A-Alucard.&quot;

&quot;And whom does he serve?&quot;

&quot;Y-you.&quot;

&quot;Does that not make you, by blood and by duty, my servant?&quot;

A slight nod.

&quot;Then follow his orders.  And follow mine.  Drop that sheet.&quot;

She does.  Her pale stomach is taut.  Her chest hitches; she&#39;s 
actually trying not to cry.  To my surprise, this knowledge makes her 
beautiful.

I am on the bed now, lightly straddling her hips, my pale fingers 
pinning her arms to the pillows.  I can feel her every curve lightly 
muted against mine.  Slut.  She&#39;s making me horny already.

&quot;And drink your blood,&quot; I mutter.  &quot;The next time you drink mine, I 
will make absolutely certain that no one will find your remnants.&quot;

And for a little while longer, I allow myself to forget my name and 
everything my name brings with it.

I hate that about her.  I fucking hate vampires.
