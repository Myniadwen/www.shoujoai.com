<h1>Three Nights and a Night (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Without some form of release, stress levels will build up, eventually 
impairing the person&#39;s ability to function at their absolute best. Sir 
Integra Hellsing knew that just about as well as anyone, but actually 
doing something about it was somewhat more difficult.

The white haired young woman had her vices, of course.

The slim cigars she chose to smoke weren&#39;t all that healthy, but she 
enjoyed having them none the less. And she was known to indulge in the 
occasional drink as well.

Teasing Alucard would probably be counted by some people as a vice too, 
but she considered it more of an occupational hazard.

When she first passed by the little nightclub not far from headquarters, 
she was intrigued. Seemingly having appeared from nowhere, the club had 
a bustling business. She had the organization check it out, of course, 
but except for an odd irregularity in location it was clean. According 
to the records it was based in Japan, not here in London.

So Integra ventured inside Arisugawa&#39;s Locket...

To do so, the bargain she made with herself was a simple one. The 
cell-phone and pager she carried with her all the time were always left 
on and ready in case an emergency called her away, but other than that 
she considered herself to be off-duty on these little excursions. After 
a few visits to investigate the place she finally let herself drink, 
smoke, and simply relax for a bit, before returning to the battlefield 
one again.

And talk, too.

The bar&#39;s owner was an interesting woman of quite a high caliber. If 
Arisugawa Juri was at all interested, she would have tried to recruit 
her for the Hellsing organization on the spot. She listened to all of 
Integra&#39;s carefully edited stories calmly, and her comments were often 
quite insightful. Juri also didn&#39;t seem to judge, and over time Integra 
found herself discussing more personal things, the difficulties of 
command and how they seemed to effect her.

The London fog swirled around Integra as she aperoached the friont door, 
the tall bouncer opening the door with a wry smile. Integra nodded to 
the young woman that was servuing as a greeter then made her way through 
the busy crowd towards a corner table where she could keep an eye on 
most of the main floor.

Integra settled into her seat, the chair sighing softly as she let her 
full weight rest upon it. She took her round glasses off a moment to 
gently rub at her eyes, then slid them back on again. With a relieved 
sigh Integra loosened her tie, and sat back in her tailored gray suit.

Juri walked over to the table, her long orange hair swinging behind her, 
carrying a bottle and a single glass. She sat down across from her and 
asked with a smile, &quot;Whisky, neat?&quot;

The light glinted off her round glasses as Integra tipped her head back 
and downed it all in one shot. She shuddered, visibly, then relaxed just 
a bit. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said quietly.

Juri topped her drink up, &quot;Your welcome.&quot;

Integra reached into her dress coat, drawing a thin cigar out and 
lighting it up. She drew on it deeply the asked a question that had been 
bothering her, &quot;How is it that a Japanese bar can be accessed in the 
middle of Britain?&quot;

&quot;Trade secret,&quot; Juri shrugged.

&quot;In other words, you can&#39;t explain it either,&quot; Integra said, and fought 
a smile as Juri twitched slightly, confirming that theory.

&quot;So how are your romantic prospects going?&quot; Juri asked with a smile.

Integra had to struggle to avoid showing her wince. When she had been 
talking to Juri last time, she had let it slip that there was someone 
she that was interested in. The woman had a odd ability to induce people 
to talk. Like a good bartender or priest, Juri simply let herself be 
open to whatever you said, knowing that you always had something that 
you wanted or needed to say.

&quot;They&#39;re not,&quot; Integra said grimly, taking another drink. The whisky 
burned as it went down, a soothing warmth swiftly spreading through her. 
Integra hesitated a moment, then added, &quot;She doesn&#39;t even know I&#39;m 
attracted, hopefully.&quot;

Juri&#39;s eyebrows shot up at that. &quot;Why hopefully?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Because she&#39;s an officer under my command,&quot; Integra explained 
patiently, &quot;and therefore I can not risk becoming involved with her.&quot;

&quot;So you remain celibate,&quot; Juri made it a statement, not a question.

Integra nodded, keeping her expression carefully bland. Juri shifted 
over slightly, the crowd parted, and her eyes widened as her face grew 
pale. &quot;Seras,&quot; she whispered softly.

The pale blond in the blue army uniform smiled, and the bouncer smiled 
back at her a bit tentatively. &quot;Good evening,&quot; Bones said, and pulled 
the door open. &#39;It&#39;s good being a regular,&#39; the blonde thought with a 
little smile.

She walked down the hallway, giving a nod to where Hitomi was waiting, 
and then made her way through the thinning crowds of the late evening 
towards the bar, where one of the two bartenders gave her a smile.

&quot;Hi, Seras,&quot; Minagi said.

Seras Victoria carefully climbed up on a bar stool, giving her a smile. 
&#39;Damn short skirt,&#39; Seras thought. Without having to ask for anything a 
small glass of something deeply red was quickly sat down before her.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Seras smiled, and tossed it back smoothly. She set it down on 
the bar, and from a old fashioned wine bottle Minagi refilled it.

Seras wondered, sometimes, why Arucard had told her about this place. 
&quot;You need to go there,&quot; was the only explanation that he had chosen to 
give her, but she was grateful, anyway. She still didn&#39;t understand how 
he had known about her, but in this place she had met people like her, 
both human and vampire.

&quot;A few of the others were in earlier tonight,&quot; Minagi said 
conversationally. &quot;Miyu and Seya for certain, and a few of the others, 
too,&quot; she added.

&quot;Remind me to stay out of Seya&#39;s way,&quot; Seras said to her quietly, &quot;she&#39;s 
just a little too intense for my tastes.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of intense,&quot; Minagi&#39;s twin Ryouko ambled over, &quot;do either of 
you know that intense white haired girl sitting over there?&quot;

Seras turned in her seat, and her eyes got very wide, &quot;Integra...&quot;

&quot;You know her?&quot; Ryouko asked. &quot;I&#39;ve seen her in a few times talking to 
the boss, but other than that she doesn&#39;t mix much,&quot; she reported.

&quot;She&#39;s my boss,&quot; Seras said softly, voice touched by a bit of fear. &#39;Did 
she follow me here, to trap me?&#39; she thought to herself wildly.

Minagi saw the girl&#39;s cheeks go pale, well, at least a bit paler looking 
anyway and hastened to reassure her, &quot;Juri&#39;s been keeping an eye on her, 
and if she wasn&#39;t sure of her intentions, she wouldn&#39;t still be coming 
here.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go over and say hi?&quot; Ryouko suggested.

Seras&#39;s scarlet eyes got wide, &quot;That&#39;s easy for you to say.&quot; She shook 
her head, &quot;She&#39;s as tough as they come, nothing scares her and she never 
runs from anything.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got to get out of here, right now,&quot; Integra blurted out, rising 
from her seat and quickly grabbing at her coat.

Juri grabbed her arm, restraining her carefully as she said, &quot;If you 
bolt, you&#39;ll draw even more attention to yourself.&quot;

A fierce look passed Integra&#39;s face, but at Juri&#39;s gentle urging she 
reluctantly sat back down. She reflexedly tidied up her crisp suit, 
making sure it sat on her neatly. &quot;I need,&quot; she said to Juri coldly, &quot;to 
leave immediately.&quot;

&quot;If you really need to, I&#39;ll help,&quot; Juri said, obviously confused by 
what had shaken the normally controlled young woman so badly. Then her 
eyes widened, and a little smile teased Juri&#39;s lips. &quot;She&#39;s the one, 
isn&#39;t she?&quot; Juri asked.

Integra opened up her mouth to try and protest, then shut it, realizing 
there was no point. &quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted quietly, &quot;though I&#39;d prefer if 
you keep your voice down, please. Let&#39;s not let the whole bar know about 
it.&quot;

A slight smile was the only apology Integra got from Juri. She indulged 
herself in looking over at Seras for a few moments before she left. The 
little blond was strikingly beautiful, her short hair falling into her 
red eyes. A subtle innocence still remained in her, even with all the 
changes the girl had been put through.

Then the decision about what to do was taken right out of her hands. 
Integra saw Seras get up from her seat at the bar, taking a moment 
tidying her clothing. She nodded to the twins behind the bar, and then 
she began to walk to her table. Integra sat there frozen, those red eyes 
growing closer and closer until she was standing there by the table.

&quot;Good evening, Sir,&quot; Seras said to her respectfully.

&quot;Seras,&quot; Integra started to say, when Juri smoothly stood up. Integra&#39;s 
eyes silently pleaded with her, &#39;Don&#39;t go!&#39;

But Juri just smiled back, &quot;Excuse me, but duty calls.&quot; With that, the 
tall, orange haired woman strode off into the crowd.

Seras stood there for a few seconds, then she quietly asked her, &quot;Would 
you mind if I sat down, sir?&quot;

Integra met Seras&#39;s eyes, and was surprised at the gentle pleading she 
saw in them. &quot;Please, sit,&quot; she smiled at the young woman, &quot;and you 
don&#39;t need to call me sir, here.&quot; Seras drew back the chair and sat 
down, being careful to keep her short skirt from riding up too much. &#39;I 
wonder if I should change the uniform to slacks?&#39; Integra found herself 
wondering.

&quot;I didn&#39;t expect to see you here,&quot; Seras said, looking away from her 
shyly. The vampire girl was clearly nervous, and Integra was just a bit 
touched by that.

&quot;Neither did I,&quot; Integra said quietly. Seras had chosen one of her older 
uniforms, one without the Hellsing unit patch on it. A wise move, though 
Integra did find herself wondering if there was some kind of symbolism 
to the act.

&quot;Alucard told me about this place,&quot; Seras said to her quietly.

&quot;Alucard?&quot; Integra sounded honestly surprised. Seras shrugged 
eloquently, and Integra actually smiled a bit, shaking her head.

Seras smiled, &quot;You really frightened me, when we first met.&quot; Integra 
looked surprised at hearing that, so she elaborated, &quot;Here I was being 
carried by this big, tough vampire, who was meekly being berated by this 
cool woman in a business suit!&quot;

Integra chuckled softly. &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; she admitted. &quot;What 
I remembered most was your turning you head to look at me, and those 
striking red eyes. I just knew, then, that you&#39;d be trouble,&quot; she said 
with a teasing smile.

&quot;And then in the manor, you really surprised me,&quot; Seras smiled.

Integra looked just a bit sheepish, &quot;I was startled a bit, seeing this 
cute little face peeking up from the stairway.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t go around drinking anyone&#39;s blood,&quot; a smiling Seras said in a 
very passable imitation of Integra herself.

&quot;It was the first thing I could think of to say,&quot; Integra smiled, 
lifting her drink to her lips. She drew another cigar out from her dress 
jacket, &quot;Do you mind?&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t hurt me,&quot; Seras smiled. She looked up, &quot;And I notice you choose 
to smoke near the outflow vent.&quot;

&quot;No reason to inflict it on anyone else,&quot; Integra shrugged, drawing on 
the cigar deeply. It gave her a moment to gather her thoughts. She 
wished she knew what Seras was thinking right now, what was going on 
behind those red eyes.

&#39;She said I was cute,&#39; was the odd thought that ran through Seras&#39;s 
head. She covered her confusion as she drank something thick and red 
from her glass, savoring it a moment before gently putting the glass 
down.

Seras almost couldn&#39;t believe that she was sitting here, talking so very 
easily with Integra Hellsing herself. She snuck a covert glance at the 
lady, at her aristocratic face and white hair falling gently into her 
eyes.

She found herself wondering why she really hadn&#39;t noticed how attractive 
Integra was before. Seras saw her almost everyday, but she had never 
noticed how nice her smile was, or how blue her eyes were behind those 
big, round glasses.

&quot;Are you dating Alucard?&quot; Seras found herself asking her, and saw 
Integra begin to choke on her smoke.

She quickly got up and went behind Integra, gently patting her on the 
back. &quot;No,&quot; Integra managed to get out, her eyes watering.

Seras picked up Integra&#39;s drink, gently holding it to her lips. &quot;Are you 
all right?&quot; Seras asked after Integra downed some of the whisky.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Integra said, looking a bit cross, &quot;I was just a bit surprised.&quot; 
She paused before finally asking, &quot;Where did you get that idea?&quot;

If Seras physically was still able to blush, she would have then. &quot;It&#39;s 
just that he&#39;s so into you,&quot; she confessed.

&quot;Trust me,&quot; Integra looked at Seras over the edge of her cup, &quot;Alucard 
is certainly not my type. Not at all.&quot;

&#39;I wonder who her type is,&#39; Seras found herself thinking. She opened up 
her mouth to ask another question, then closed it.

&quot;What?&quot; Integra quietly asked. A slight smile crossed her face as she 
continued gently, &quot;You may as well ask me.&quot;

&#39;God, is she a mind reader, too?&#39; Seras thought. She reconsidered her 
question and another thing struck her, &quot;When Alucard killed that 
reporter, you seemed so... calm.&quot;

Blue eyes searched her own across the small table, then Integra said, 
&quot;The reason I left there so quickly was because I thought I was going to 
be sick.&quot;

&quot;You certainly didn&#39;t show it,&quot; Seras smiled ruefully. She took a deep 
breath, &quot;It took all my self control not to lunge at her, myself.&quot; A 
gentle hand rested on her own, and Seras blushed under Integra&#39;s gaze.

&quot;I know you had some trouble adapting,&quot; Integra said softly, and Seras 
ached at the kindness she heard in that voice. &quot;I wish there had been 
more I could do to help,&quot; and there was a bit of regret in that smooth 
voice.

&quot;You&#39;re not like this back at base,&quot; Seras smiled at her shyly.

Integra sighed softly, &quot;I know what they all expect of me, Seras. I&#39;m on 
duty there all the time, and the soldiers want to see the me as some 
kind of iron lady.&quot; She slumped just a little in her chair, and Seras 
began to see what being the leader of Hellsing cost Integra.

Seras gently lay her hand over Integra&#39;s, gently catching it between her 
palms. A soft squeeze, &quot;If there&#39;s anything I can do, just ask.&quot;

A moment of silence, and Integra smiled slightly. She squeezed Seras&#39;s 
hands as she admitted, &quot;I could use a friend.&quot;
