<h1>Through the Years (part 5 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../hellsing/thruyears-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES - Okay, so we now know that Rally had found out about the 
Hellsing Organization, and with Seras Victoria had another run-in with 
Anderson.  Now it&#39;s time to take this story in a new direction.  I 
cannot tell you what will happen next, only that when the series is all 
over... Rally&#39;s life will be changed forever!
 
For this to happen, I&#39;m taking as an inspiration a Hellsing fanfiction 
story that had appeared in FanFiction.net titled &quot;Can You Hear the 
Darkness&quot; (somehow, the story got deleted, don&#39;t ask me how).  That 
should explain some of the liberties I&#39;m taking with the Hellsing OVA 
canon (I know the canon correctly... but it&#39;s MY story, so I can change 
a few of the facts if I want to).
 
With that said... on with the story.

A DARK ROAD NEAR JOLIET STATE PRISON, LATE NIGHT...
 
Alfie sat in the police escort van as it drove down the dark road to his 
destination.  Originally, he had been charged with a variety of 
offenses, one was failure to appear in court.  During his last 
appearance on the dock, it was decided to revoke his bail rights and 
have him remanded at the state prison&#39;s segregation unit until it was 
time to appear.  But it didn&#39;t help his sour mood any, as he was still 
angrily thinking about the individual who put him in his current 
situation - Rally Vincent.
 
&quot;Hey Ralph?&quot; one of the police officers asked the other, &quot;How much time 
do you think our guest is going to have once his trial is over?&quot;
 
&quot;If you ask me, Vinnie... not enough!&quot; Ralph growled.  &quot;I heard this guy 
stole and sold military weapons and explosives while he served oversees!  
My brother lost a leg in Kandahar because of this, and for that I think 
he should be shot!&quot;
 
&quot;Crybabies,&quot; Alfie growled under his breath.
 
Vinnie looked back; Ralph was driving.  &quot;What was that, buddy?&quot; he 
asked.
 
&quot;Nevermind,&quot; Alfie snapped back, then whispered, &quot;Assholes.&quot;
 
The trip when on without further incident, the two officers continued to 
talk amongst themselves while Alfie stewed, thinking of several ways to 
kill Rally if he ever saw her again.  But quite suddenly, a car that, 
for the last five miles had followed the van, suddenly passed them, then 
spun out-of-control before ending up in the ditch on the side of the 
road.  Ralph quickly pulled the van to the side and radioed in, while 
Vinnie got out and raced to the driver&#39;s side.
 
Inside the car, a young girl seemed to be dazed from her experience.  
Vinnie looked her over quickly and yelled out, &quot;SHE SEEMS ALRIGHT, BUT 
YOU BETTER CALL PARAMEDICS JUST IN CASE!&quot;  He returned his attention to 
the girl and asked, &quot;Are you alright, Miss?&quot;
 
&quot;I am,&quot; she answered... but then looked at Vinnie, smiled and added... 
while pointing a gun at his head, &quot;Too bad you&#39;re not.&quot;  
 
Vinnie didn&#39;t have time to react, as the bullet fired hit him square in 
the forehead, killing him instantly.  Ralph, who was out of the van by 
this time, saw what happened and drew down on the girl.  But before he 
could issue any commands, two shots struck his arm from the side.  
Turning, he saw another girl, smiling and armed as well.  Before he 
could reach for his reserve gun and attack this new girl, the first girl 
finished him off with a single shot to the head.
 
In a panic, Alfie looked around franticly but saw no escape.  The girls 
then boarded the van, turned to the crook, and the first one said, &quot;Hey 
don&#39;t worry... you&#39;ll be alright.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah,&quot; the second one added while buckling in.  &quot;The mistress wanted to 
free you so that you can do a favor for her.&quot;
 
&quot;Uh... mistress?&quot; Alfie blundered.  &quot;Just what are...?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry,&quot; the first girl said as her partner cut the wires from 
the G.P.S. antenna on the van, &quot;you&#39;ll meet her in two days.  She had to 
go out of town for a while.&quot;  Once her partner was situated, the first 
girl started up the van and drove off, leaving behind the bodies of 
Vinnie and Ralph on the road.
 
A HOUSE OUTSIDE AURORA, ILLINOIS, AT THE SAME TIME...
 
There were two individuals that had greeted the Cobra driving up to the 
safehouse jointly operated by the United States government and the 
Chicago Police Department.  One of them was definitely Detective Roy 
Coleman of the Chicago P.D..  The other was another man, his long blonde 
hair tied in back in a ponytail.  He also wore a dingy-tan trenchcoat, 
and had some facial stubble.  
 
Coleman approached the Cobra as Rally Vincent, &quot;Minnie&quot; May Hopkins and 
Seras Victoria exited.  &quot;Rally, what the hell happened that you had to 
call this dirtbag?&quot; he asked rather brusquely, pointing a thumb at the 
other man.
 
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you in a second, Roy,&quot; Rally said, at least grateful that her 
friend was worried.  &quot;Hey Bill,&quot; she called to the other, &quot;Thanks for 
the help.&quot;
 
&quot;Anytime, Pussycat,&quot; the other man - A.T.F. agent Bill Collins - said, 
giving the dusky-skinned bounty hunter a wave.  &quot;But I still like to 
know if you can get Becky to help me out?&quot;
 
&quot;Hey put a sock in it!&quot; growled Rally.  &quot;I told you that I&#39;ll call 
Becky!  Right now I&#39;ve got to let Roy in on what had happened tonight!&quot;  
 
&quot;Okay Rally, just pull in your claws already,&quot; Collins replied, holding 
up his hands.  He then noticed Seras walking behind Rally while May went 
to the trunk.  &quot;Hey, good looking,&quot; he began, smiling suavely, &quot;you free 
later on?&quot;
 
&quot;Not... interested!&quot; snapped back Seras, who shot Collins a poisonous 
glare.  Collins decided to pull back, not knowing what was worse, Seras&#39; 
reply... or her red eyes, which seemed to burrow into the A.T.F. agent&#39;s 
very soul.
 
May, in the meantime, had got out what appeared to be a huge metal 
toolkit.  Both she and Seras advanced to the entrance of the house, but 
the young Draculina hesitated.  The petite blonde noticed this, thinking 
to herself, &#39;I guess she can&#39;t enter a human dwelling without being 
invited first.&#39;  Smiling, May looked at Seras and said, &quot;It&#39;s okay, you 
can come inside with us, Seras.&quot;
 
Sighing heavily, Seras replied with, &quot;Thanks.  I was wondering if you 
and Rally were going to invite me in.&quot;  The two then disappeared inside.
 
&quot;Look... if you&#39;re not going to be needing me,&quot; Collins meekly called 
out, relieved that Seras was inside, &quot;I&#39;m going back to Chicago to find 
out more about that security breach.  Now remember your promise, 
Rally... okay?&quot;
 
&quot;Yessss, Bill,&quot; Rally snarled, feeling a similar feeling of relief now 
that Collins was leaving.  As soon as the A.T.F. agent&#39;s car was in the 
distance, she turned her attention to Coleman.  &quot;Sorry to get you out 
here, Roy.  Myself, May and our guest got jumped by a rather annoying 
priest while headed back home from dinner with Integra.&quot;
 
&quot;It must be that priest Anderson that had filled-in for the one that was 
murdered earlier this week,&quot; Coleman answered.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry Rally, I&#39;ll 
personally see to it that he won&#39;t cause you any harm.&quot;  He then turned 
to his car.
 
&quot;NO-NO ROY, DON&#39;T GO NEAR HIM!!!&quot; Rally yelled, startling Coleman.  
&quot;Roy, I don&#39;t know how or why... but this guy&#39;s been altered in a way 
that he can heal any wound he gets.  I&#39;ve shot a full clip into him, 
including a head shot, and Seras also fired what she got, and he was 
hardly scratched.  It finally took two of May&#39;s grenades to knock him 
out, for how long we don&#39;t know, because we didn&#39;t stick around long 
enough to find out.  Not to mention he&#39;s pretty handy with knives.  I 
don&#39;t want to find out you got killed by this guy.&quot;
 
Coleman thought for a while.  &quot;Okay... how about I have several 
patrolmen keep an eye on your house and see if he shows up and what he&#39;s 
up to?  Will that help?&quot;  Rally nodded in the affirmative.  &quot;Good,&quot; he 
said.  &quot;By the way, who the heck&#39;s that new girl... the one you called 
Seras?  She got a uniform, albeit a bit skimpy, but she doesn&#39;t seem to 
be the military type.&quot;
 
Rally hesitated for a bit.  &quot;Ask me later... alright, Roy?   I&#39;m still 
digesting all what&#39;s happening and... it&#39;s a little complicated.&quot;
 
&quot;If you say so,&quot; Coleman said, entering the car.  As he started up, he 
opened his window and added, &quot;Oh... I took the time to get you and May a 
few groceries before you got here.  I figured you might be here for a 
while, and I wouldn&#39;t want you two to get hungry.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks, Roy.  You&#39;re a big help.&quot;  Coleman then drove off, with Rally 
adding quietly, &quot;But I really don&#39;t think they&#39;ll help Seras much.&quot;  
When Coleman&#39;s car disappeared, she entered the safehouse herself.

Once inside, Rally found that May had already clamped a portable vise 
that was inside the toolkit to a fairly sturdy table.  Also removed from 
the steel box was a powder scale, several cans of gunpowder, funnels, 
trays and the like.  May had already placed one of her grenades in the 
vise and was using a pair of pliers with cushioned jaws to remove the 
fuse from the top.  &quot;Rally,&quot; she began, &quot;I&#39;m going to have to readjust 
the powder charge on a couple of these grenades to make them more 
powerful.  If we have to face that Anderson guy again, I want to make 
sure we&#39;ve got the tools to at least put him out of action for a while.&quot;
 
&quot;Good idea, May.  You get to it, I&#39;ll check on our accommodations,&quot; 
answered back Rally, who went into where the surveillance gear was 
stowed... just to make sure Collins didn&#39;t leave behind anything that 
can record what they saw.  Once she was satisfied that the room was 
empty and they weren&#39;t being observed, she went into the living room, 
where Seras had broken down and was examining her submachine gun.  
&quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry you had to be dragged into this, Seras.  Believe me, 
this wasn&#39;t what I had in mind.&quot;
 
Seras looked Rally over, was satisfied and replied, &quot;That&#39;s alright.  I 
was half-expecting Paladin Anderson to attack... just not so soon.&quot;
 
Rally silently nodded, then added uncomfortably, &quot;Look... I know this 
might be a little sensitive for you... but how long can you go 
without... uh... you know...&quot;
 
&quot;Without feeding, is that what you mean?&quot; inquired Seras.  Rally nodded 
in agreement.  &quot;A couple of days, I guess... maybe longer.  Although 
that interval might be shorter; I&#39;ve been feeding more often.&quot;  She then 
added, &quot;Don&#39;t worry... I won&#39;t harm you and May.  I would rather die 
than taking blood unwillingly from a human.  As for apologies, I think I 
should offer mine as well.&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?  What have you done to apologize for?&quot; asked Rally.
 
&quot;For being jealous of you,&quot; Seras answered meekly.  &quot;I... thought you 
and Sir Integra might be having a relationship... and I felt a little 
uncomfortable because of it.&quot;
 
&quot;Now wait a minute... you mean you thought me and Integra...?&quot; inquired 
Rally, catching on.  &quot;You mean you&#39;re a lesbian?&quot;  Seras nodded, then 
was surprised by a smiling Rally.  &quot;Look... you don&#39;t have to worry 
about me and May being judgmental about you.  In my opinion, people are 
free to be whoever they are, vampire or not.  As for May... well... I 
wouldn&#39;t surprised if she had a few female customers during her 
streetwalking days.&quot;
 
That comment surprised Seras.  &quot;May... a former prostitute?&quot; she gasped, 
looking at May at work on the table.  &quot;She looks so young.&quot;
 
&quot;Believe me, May&#39;s much older than she looks,&quot; added Rally.  &quot;Right now, 
I better get a hold of Integra and tell her we&#39;re here.&quot;  She then found 
the landline phone on the table and dialed the number Sir Integra had 
given her earlier in the evening.

RALLY AND MAY&#39;S HOME, CHICAGO...
 
&quot;Wonder why we&#39;re checking this empty house out?&quot; a Chicago policewoman 
said to her partner, making another round near the house Rally and May 
shared.
 
&quot;From what Detective Coleman told me,&quot; her senior partner said, &quot;all we 
had to do is watch for suspicious activity and if we see it, report but 
take no action.&quot;  He looked closely around.  &quot;Nope... all clear.  Let&#39;s 
go.  We&#39;ll come back here in a few hours and check again.&quot;  The cruiser 
the two officers then accelerated away... afterwhich Paladin Alexander 
Anderson made his way from his place of concealment.
 
&quot;Hmm... seems &#39;alf the constabulary of this city is makin&#39; th&#39; rounds 
&#39;ere,&quot; the priest said to himself.  &quot;Guess it would be wise t&#39; keep 
clear of this place for a few days.  Ah&#39;ve got other places t&#39; watch, 
though.&quot;  He then walked off, looking for a new place to make his 
surveillance.
 
THE EXTENSION COMPOUND OF THE UNITED KINGDOM...
 
&quot;It is hardly a coincidence that Iscariot had attacked you so soon,&quot; Sir 
Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing said, talking to Rally from her 
phone.  The leader of the Hellsing Organization had dressed for bed when 
the phone call came.  Dressed in her pajamas, she sat at the bed&#39;s edge 
listening to her friend.
 
&quot;Tell me about it, Integra,&quot; Rally replied.  &quot;Look, you&#39;ve got the phone 
number I gave you, so could you look into that favor I asked?  I&#39;ve got 
a feeling that whoever broke into the A.T.F.&#39;s database was the same 
ones that tipped-off Iscariot.&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed I shall, Rally.  Thank you.&quot;  Sir Integra then hung up the 
phone, then pondered what her friend had told her.  Then quite suddenly, 
she felt a presence in her room.  Turning to her right, she was witness 
to Alucard emerging from the shadows.
 
&quot;Interesting,&quot; the No-Life King mused, &quot;the fact that Paladin Anderson 
would attack them as soon as he did.  Even more interesting is the way 
they settled that battle.&quot;  He chuckled evilly, &quot;I bet he&#39;ll be 
spitting-up shrapnel for about a week.&quot;
 
&quot;True, but they are far from home, and Seras will need proper provisions 
if she is to do her job effectively.  Unfortunately,&quot; Sir Integra added, 
&quot;in the rush to get the information about Iscariot, I had failed to 
obtain the address of where they are at right now.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh I wouldn&#39;t worry about that,&quot; Alucard said, &quot;I believe that I can 
accomplish that task.&quot;  But unexpectedly, he knelt down to Sir Integra.  
&quot;You&#39;re worried about the Police Girl.  So she finally confessed her 
love for you,&quot; he began, his voice showing a tenderness unusual for him.
 
&quot;And mine for her, as well,&quot; answered Sir Integra.  Looking at her 
servant, she added, &quot;Alucard... was I wrong to tell her to engage in a 
polyamorous relationship with another lover as well as I?  I could see 
she was not expecting such an answer.&quot;
 
&quot;You had to tell her that.  I know you love her, but I also know you 
cannot join the Police Girl into darkness because of your obligations to 
the British crown,&quot; Alucard answered, looking firmly at his master.  &quot;At 
least she knows of your love for her, but also of her options.&quot;
 
&quot;I know... but it sounds like I care little for Seras,&quot; Sir Integra 
added, getting into bed and pulling the covers over her.  &quot;What option 
DOES she have, anyway?&quot;
 
&quot;Who knows?  The future holds many surprises,&quot; said Alucard.  &quot;Now get 
some sleep.  Tomorrow&#39;s a big day.&quot;
 
&quot;Perhaps in more ways than one,&quot; Sir Integra yawned, Alucard turning off 
the lights.
 
MORNING, AURORA...
 
When Rally and May went to bed, Seras had volunteered to stay-up and 
guard the house.  Now it was morning, and Rally roused herself, the sun 
shining brightly through the shades.  Almost irrationally, she made a 
quick check of her neck and found it unharmed.  Then she was surprised 
to hear a small moan underneath the bed.  Looking under it, she found 
Seras, lying corpselike in a deep sleep.
 
Rally silently chuckled, watching the young Draculina sleep.  &#39;You 
know,&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;she&#39;s almost cute sleeping like that.  
Wait a minute,&#39; she mentally added, surprised by her own thoughts, &#39;did 
I say cute?  I guess so, although I don&#39;t know why.  Kinda like her 
figure, though... wish my bustline was like hers.&#39;  Dismissing her 
thoughts, Rally gathered herself, showered, got dressed and joined May 
in the kitchen.
 
The aforementioned explosive expert was busy setting down a breakfast on 
the same table she still had her grenade vise when Rally walked in.  &quot;Oh 
good morning,&quot; she chirped.  &quot;I was wondering how pancakes sound this 
morning... microwave, of course.&quot;
 
&quot;Sounds great to me,&quot; Rally answered back as May set down a cup of 
coffee next to her breakfast.  The two then settled down and began to 
eat when May started up.  &quot;What in the world are we going to do, Rally?  
We can&#39;t live here forever.  And there&#39;s still the shop to worry about.&quot; 
 
&quot;Agreed.  It&#39;s a good thing it&#39;s the weekend and the shop&#39;s closed 
around this time.&quot;  Rally took a bite of her pancakes before continuing.  
&quot;Hopefully Integra will get ahold of Becky and find out about both the 
A.T.F. break-in, not to mention why Iscariot is after us.&quot;
 
&quot;And what about Seras?&quot; added May.  &quot;She&#39;s going to need blood to drink, 
and I&#39;m a little scared she might look to us as a source.&quot;
 
&quot;Tell me about it.  The first thing I did was check my neck to see if 
she had a little midnight snack,&quot; muttered Rally.  &quot;I feel a bit ashamed 
of not trusting her, but I guess that&#39;s the human in me.&quot;
 
&quot;I agree.  Did the same myself,&quot; said May, laughing humorlessly.
 
The two women then ate their breakfast, not saying anything more.  Just 
as May was cleaning up afterwards, a firm knocking was heard at the 
door.  Both of them then dropped what they were doing and took up 
positions near the door, Rally in front, gun drawn while May stood 
behind, grenade in hand in case it was Anderson.  Slowly, the 
dark-haired bounty hunter crept to the door and slowly looked through 
the peephole viewer... afterwhich her eyes went wide.  
 
&quot;No way!&quot; she gasped, quickly going to the locks and swinging open the 
door.  Standing there... in the morning sun... was Alucard, grinning his 
usual wicked grin and carrying a pouch at his side.
 
&quot;I was wondering if you would invite me inside,&quot; the No-Life King began, 
smiling.  &quot;I really like to get out of this damnable sunlight.&quot;
 
&quot;Uhhh... okay,&quot; muttered Rally, stepping aside to let Alucard in.  May 
also drew back, equally surprised.  As soon as he was inside, Rally 
walked up to him and said, &quot;I knew Integra said you were powerful... but 
this blew me away!&quot;
 
&quot;So I take it you&#39;re impressed?  It is rare for me to hear a human give 
me such praise.&quot;  Alucard then handed Rally the pouch.  &quot;I would suggest 
you place these in a freezer.  I have two pouches already thawed so I 
would suggest you place one in the refrigerator.&quot;
 
Rally looked inside.  Several frozen blood packets were inside.  &quot;Thank 
goodness.  I was getting worried that we wouldn&#39;t have anything to feed 
Seras.&quot;
 
&quot;As you should.  She can be a bit unruly when she doesn&#39;t feed 
regularly,&quot; Alucard replied, taking one of the thawed packets for 
himself.
 
Quickly, Rally took the frozen blood and placed it in the freezer, 
placing the one thawed packet in the refrigerator.  May just watched as 
Alucard sat himself down, then pull the plug from the silicone tubing 
and consume the blood like a juice box.  She then returned to cleaning 
up from breakfast.
 
&quot;I take it that the Police Girl is asleep,&quot; Alucard began, finishing his 
blood.
 
&quot;If you mean Seras, she is.  She&#39;s under my bed right now,&quot; answered 
Rally.
 
&quot;I see,&quot; Alucard mused.  &quot;If you would, I&#39;d like to have a private 
conversation with you, Miss Vincent.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay,&quot; Rally nervously replied.  As they moved to another part of the 
house, she added, &quot;By the way, how in the world were you able to find 
us?  I didn&#39;t tell Integra where we are.&quot;
 
Alucard grinned as he answered, &quot;The Police Girl is still my fledgling.  
All I had to do is to probe her mind, a relatively easy task.&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry I asked,&quot; grumbled Rally, not liking how he found out.
 
They soon made their way to the surveillance room, empty with equipment.  
Then Alucard&#39;s tone changed.  &quot;Miss Vincent,&quot; he began, &quot;there is a 
question I would like to ask you... and please don&#39;t feel offended when 
I ask.&quot;
 
&quot;Ask me what?&quot; offered the dusky-skinned girl.
 
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to be a virgin, would you?&quot; the red-clad vampire 
asked.
 
Rally could feel the blush forming on her cheeks.  &quot;Well... yes... but 
I&#39;m not sure...&quot;
&quot;I will explain,&quot; interrupted Alucard.  &quot;I asked that because, if you 
and Seras happen to find yourselves in a grave situation, and she needs 
blood, then you can safely offer some of yours to help her.&quot;
 
&quot;Really?&quot; quipped Rally.  &quot;But why me?  Couldn&#39;t May do the same?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m afraid not.  Only a virgin can survive a vampire&#39;s bite without 
being turned into a ghoul,&quot; the No-Life King answered.  &quot;If you&#39;re 
worried about being turned into a vampire yourself, I can assure you 
that the only way you can is if you happen to die from the bite.  The 
Police Girl is well-trained in taking blood without killing.  But there 
is something else I should warn you about.  If you do offer blood to 
her, and she has to bite you to obtain it, you might find yourself... 
strangely attracted to her... and you would become the Police Girl&#39;s 
chosen prey.  The sensation can be quite powerful, I can assure you.&quot;
 
Rally digested this for a bit.  &quot;Well... at least we have an option if 
we don&#39;t happen to have one of those blood packs with us.  As for the 
aftereffects... I guess I can handle myself.&quot;
 
Alucard looked Rally over carefully.  &quot;One might hope,&quot; he added.  
&quot;Well... if you&#39;ll excuse me, I believe I&#39;ll use this room to rest until 
nightfall.  There is... something I need to talk to the Police Girl 
about when she wakes.&quot;
 
&quot;If you say so,&quot; Rally said, heading out the door and turning off the 
switch, leaving Alucard alone.

THE EXTENSION COMPOUND OF THE UNITED KINGDOM...
 
If the truth were to be told, Becky &quot;the Nose&quot; Farrah felt a little 
intimidated sitting in the back seat of the Rolls-Royce as it entered 
the compound.  When she got the call this morning, she was a little 
surprised that Rally had ran into a little trouble, but had recommended 
her in a little task... whatever it was.
 
After exiting, she was led by Walter C. Dolnez, the Hellsing family&#39;s 
butler... and former trashman, to Sir Integra&#39;s office, where she was 
going over some paperwork.  &quot;Ah good, you&#39;re here at last, Miss Farrah,&quot; 
she said, looking up.
 
&quot;Likewise,&quot; Becky answered.  &quot;To be honest, I was a little nervous 
coming here.  So what is it you need, Sir Integra?&quot;
 
&quot;Very well,&quot; the pale blonde woman began, &quot;I will get to the point... it 
seems that Rally had ran into a little trouble last night.  Do not 
worry, she is unharmed, but is currently in hiding.  What I would like 
to do is to contract your services in a little investigation.  Walter is 
a good computer expert, but I was told by Rally that you have a better 
knack at accessing restricted information.&quot;
 
&quot;I see Rally was being modest as usual,&quot; Becky answered.  &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll 
take the job... but I must warn you, I don&#39;t work cheap.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, Rally did say that you would command a sizeable fee for your 
services,&quot; Sir Integra said as she scribbled a figure on a slip of 
paper, which she handed to Becky.  &quot;I hope the amount is to your 
liking.&quot;
 
Eyeing Sir Integra suspiciously, Becky glanced at the paper...  and 
nearly fainted as she read it.  &quot;This... this...&quot; she managed to 
stammer.
 
Raising an eyebrow enquiringly, Sir Integra added, &quot;If the amount is not 
enough, I can offer more.  It will be wired from my bank in London in 
U.S. funds to your account directly.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; Becky gasped, her eyes wide.  &quot;No-no, this is fine, thank you.&quot;  
Once again eyeing the amount, she thought to herself, &#39;Oh my!  With this 
amount, I can be able to finally get all the equipment I need to upgrade 
and still have a little on the side for incidentals... not to mention 
living comfortably for at least a few months!&#39;  Finally regaining her 
senses, she looked at Sir Integra and asked meekly, &quot;So... when shall I 
start?&quot;
 
&quot;Well... I would think that... now would be a good time,&quot; Sir Integra 
answered back, smiling.
 
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s fine by me,&quot; replied Becky, still feeling the butterflies 
in her stomach.  &quot;Gotta give you your money&#39;s worth after all.&quot;

It was a few hours later that the sun began its final decent into night.  
Rally paced incessantly waiting for Seras to wake up.  She had already 
made the plan but wasn&#39;t going to execute it unless she had someone else 
with a gun for back-up.  But that didn&#39;t make May feel any better.  &quot;Are 
you certain about this, Rally?&quot; she asked.
 
&quot;What choice do we have?&quot; countered Rally.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to spend 
another day in these clothes, so I&#39;m going to have to risk going to the 
house to get our emergency suitcases, not to mention getting some more 
potent ammunition and additional firepower in case we run into that 
psycho Anderson again.&quot;
 
&quot;Fine, then I&#39;m going with you,&quot; said May.
 
&quot;No, May!  You stay here until me and Seras get back.&quot;
 
&quot;But Rally...&quot;
 
&quot;No buts, May,&quot; snapped Rally.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to worry about you 
as well if we run into trouble, so I want you to wait here until we get 
back.&quot;
 
&quot;That is IF you get back,&quot; May mumbled, feeling a little discouraged. 
 
In Rally&#39;s bedroom in the meantime, Seras had roused herself just as the 
sun had set.  She had gotten herself out from under the bed when she saw 
Alucard standing in front of her.  &quot;Oh Master,&quot; she blundered, surprised 
at his appearance, &quot;is... there something you need?&quot;
 
&quot;Just a small ceremony, Police Girl, that is all,&quot; the No-Life King 
answered, pulling up his sleeve.  He then produced a small scalpel, cut 
his right forearm, and produced the bleeding appendage to a surprised 
Seras.
 
&quot;Master... are you sure...&quot; gasped Seras, realizing the significance of 
what Alucard was doing.
 
The red-clad vampire&#39;s face lost all pretenses of arrogance and stared 
at the young Draculina with a warmth she had rarely seen.  &quot;I&#39;m very 
serious.  When I first offered this to you, you were still struggling to 
make sense of your turning.  I know I had ridiculed you for your 
decision to refuse but I knew you felt that you still had much to learn.  
Since then, you have learned much... you&#39;ve shed much of your annoying 
humanity... but not too much as to be a danger to others and learned to 
rule the darkness without being ruled by it.  I can teach you no 
further.  Now... drink my blood... and become an equal of myself, free 
of my control and walk the darkness as a free nosferatu... Seras 
Victoria.&quot;
 
Seras could only stare at Alucard for a few seconds before taking his 
arm in her hands.  &quot;You will always be &#39;Master&#39; to me... Alucard,&quot; she 
said before placing her mouth on the wound and began drinking her 
master&#39;s blood.  
 
For a few seconds, Seras quietly drank from Alucard&#39;s arm before he 
quietly removed it.  Suddenly, Seras felt an intense burning within her 
veins and collapsed to her knees, but soon felt her former master&#39;s arms 
around her until her involuntary quaking stopped.  &quot;There, Seras,&quot; the 
red-clad vampire said, &quot;that wasn&#39;t so bad, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;
 
&quot;N-no Master,&quot; Seras answered, &quot;although it was a bit sudden.&quot; 
 
&quot;Indeed,&quot; grinned Alucard, realizing her &#39;master&#39; reference was now a 
sign of loyalty rather than servitude.  &quot;I think you&#39;ll find very soon 
that you&#39;ll have greater mastery over your abilities, as well as more 
control over your bloodthirst... not to mention you&#39;ll now be able to 
walk in the sun for a short period of time.  That may come in handy 
sometime.&quot;  He then stood his former fledgling up and added, &quot;I think it 
is time we got ourselves downstairs and greeted our hosts.  I believe 
Miss Vincent may be needing your aid soon.&quot; 
 
Seras nodded in agreement, afterwhich the two vampires descended down 
the stairs, as not to unduly alarm Rally and May.  Rally then explained 
the plan, which was to proceed into Chicago to obtain the evacuation 
suitcases, not to mention more armament.  Having understood the plan, 
both Rally and Seras made their way to the Cobra.  Just before Rally 
entered, May exited the house with a few articles in her hands.  &quot;Listen 
Rally,&quot; she began, &quot;if you&#39;re not going to be taking me, at least take 
these grenades with you.  I&#39;ve already made the adjustments with these, 
which should come in handy if you run into Anderson.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks, May,&quot; replied Rally.  
 
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; smiled May, who then turned her attention to Seras.  
&quot;And you,&quot; she handed the Draculina the thawed blood pack, &quot;you better 
take this for on the way.&quot;
 
&quot;I appreciate it, May.  Thank you,&quot; Seras said.
 
Rally then entered the driver&#39;s side of the Cobra, then started it up 
and drove off, with May and Alucard looking on.  After the car was out 
of sight, the No-Life King turned to the explosives expert and said, &quot;I 
suggest you better get yourself inside and lock the door.  I say this 
out of experience, do not attempt to leave until you have heard from 
either Miss Vincent or Sir Integra.  Understood?&quot;
 
May sighed heavily.  &quot;I guess.  But what about you?&quot;
 
Alucard just smiled fiendishly and replied, &quot;I&#39;ve got something to do 
right now.  Don&#39;t worry about your friend... I&#39;m certain she&#39;ll 
survive.&quot;  He then faded into the darkness, leaving a nervous May to 
return to the safehouse.
