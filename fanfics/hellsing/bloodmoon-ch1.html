<h1>Bloody Moon</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dragonhealer.html">Dragonhealer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was evening at the Hellsing Organization.  The police girl stood 
silently in front of the master of her master who was sitting at her 
desk.  It had been weeks since Integra&#39;s operation, and ever since 
then, Ceras had been really worried about her.  

At first, Ceras never knew when these feelings had surfaced.  She knew 
Integra only accepted her into the organization because of her 
transformation from a human into a vampire. She could never figured out 
if she could ever get any closer to Integra than she already was.  After 
all, the only one left of her family was entirely entitled to her duty.  
From her observations Ceras could tell Integra never had any intentions 
for companionship or anything else other than her responsibily.  

But there was something Ceras wanted to do, and that was to thank her 
for accepting another vampire.  She did not have much of a choice, it 
was either the life of a vampire or death, and she was not ready to 
die yet.  And since she had no other family or friends left, she 
agreed to life as a vampire.  Still, since she was a child vampire, 
she still had her human side.  She wondered if Integra could turn to 
her emotions more often.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ceras waited until Integra was done with her work.  Integra looked up 
at the vampire girl before her, her cold blue eyes glaring at Ceras&#39; red 
eyes.  &quot;What is it, Sergeant Victoria?  Shouldn&#39;t you be in your
room?&quot;  

Ceras felt extremely nervous.  Finally she spoke up.  &quot;I....I just 
wanted to thank you for your gratitude and for accepting me.&quot;  She 
looked down at the floor.  Integra looked at her for a moment.  True, 
she was reluctant at first for having another vampire, but since she 
was Alucard&#39;s responsibily, she agreed.  &quot;And....I&#39;m sorry I could not 
be there for you sooner.  Walter was under a spell, and I had to deal 
with him, and....&quot;  Ceras shook for a moment.  &quot;When I saw you on the 
floor, bleeding, I......I....&quot;  she could no longer say anything else.  

&quot;You did what you could do, Sergeant Victoria.  Think nothing of it.&quot;  

After a second, Ceras spoke up.  &quot;Sir Integra, may I make a request?&quot;  

Integra stared at her.  &quot;Your reward is in your room right now.&quot;  

&quot;Oh, thank you, but it&#39;s not that.&quot;  

Frustration was increasing inside the Hellsing heir.  &quot;Then what is 
it?&quot;  

&quot;Master only calls me &quot;police girl.&quot; Will you call me Ceras?&quot;  

Silence.  Integra has never had such an encounter with an officer.  
But she did risk her life for her.  She had never called an officer by 
their first name.  She suddenly felt....different.  Her mind of steel 
was slowly growing soft. &quot;Very well........Ceras.&quot;  

Although it was impossible, Ceras could swear she felt her heart 
growing lighter.  Integra had never imagined a young vampire could 
have such a reaction.  &quot;Thank you so much.&quot;  She turned to leave.  
Suddenly she heard a cry.  

She turned her head and saw Integra bending over.  &quot;Sir Integra!&quot;  She 
ran back to her, but Integra held out her hand.  

&quot;Stay where you are.  I have no need for your support.&quot;  Slight pain 
shot her body as she silently stood back up.  When she looked at Ceras 
she was surprised to see her eyes water.  &lt;How can this be?  She is a 
vampire.  It is impossible for her to have feelings and emotions, 
especially for someone like me.&gt;  Integra thought to herself.  &quot;You 
are dismissed.&quot;  

Ceras wiped her eyes and ran back to her room.

As she watched the young girl, Integra sat back and began to think.  
Throughout her entire life she never had any friends of her own.  Not 
that her father never allowed her to, she was just always busy 
learning about her family&#39;s history.  Ever since then, she has 
deliberately disallowed herself from having any friends, fearing they 
would weaken her from her responsibilty.  
&lt;I just agreed to call her by her first name.  Why? That would mean a 
sign of weakness. But the way she looked at me, like she truly does 
care for me, even though I only see her as another vampire, she can 
cling to her human side.&gt;  Lately she could not help realize that 
everytime she looked into the girl&#39;s vampire eyes, she felt herself 
drawn to them, intrigued, entrapped. &lt;Why am I feeling this way for 
her?  I have never focused on anyone like that.  She is a young girl 
who has made the biggest sacrifice of her life.&gt;  Suddenly, a tiny 
desire within her heart began to surface.  She struggled to repress 
it, but it kept coming back up.  She sighed.  &lt;So this is a longing 
for a friend.  She may be a vampire, but she&#39;s young compared to 
Alucard.  No one ever told me I could never have any friends. Alucard 
was never that type.  She&#39;s still somewhat human&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------

Ceras struggled to fall asleep.  

After several attempts, she gave up.  &lt;What&#39;s the use?  I have too many 
thing on my mind to fall asleep.&gt;  She sat at the edge of her bed, 
glancing up and seeing her medical blood, in two packs now, in the bucket 
of ice.  &lt;The taste of blood.....so invigorating.....&gt; Licking her lips, 
she sat up and walked to the table.  

As she poured her blood, the door knocked.  Walter came in.  &quot;Please 
excuse my intrusion, Master Ceras, but I have a request from Sir 
Integra.&quot;  Ceras almost dropped her blood bag in the bowl.  The only 
times she was summoned was when there was FREAK vampire trouble.  
&quot;Yes, she requests that you go to her room at midnight tonight, in 
your pajamas.&quot;  

Now the vampire girl was even more confused.  &quot;Thank you, Walter.  
I&#39;ll be there.&quot;  

&quot;Excellent.  Good night, then.&quot;  With a smile, he left.  

Ceras stood there frozen.  &lt;What does she want with me?  Was it 
because of my request?  I thought she only talks with Master.&gt;  

&quot;Police girl.&quot;  A deep voice entered the room.  Ceras immediately 
recognized it as none other than Alucard.  

&quot;Master.&quot;  

&quot;Do you have any idea why my master would summon you?&quot;  

&quot;Of course not.  I&#39;m confused.&quot;  Ceras said defensively like a little 
girl.  Alucard chuckled.  Ceras was getting more and more frustrated 
each time he teased her.  &quot;Master, do you mean you know?&quot;  She glared 
at the top ceiling, her blood-red eyes shining with suspicion.  

&quot;Tell me, police girl, do you find my master attractive?&quot;  

Ceras was surprised.  &quot;I...I...&quot;  

&quot;You will know soon enough.&quot;  Then the voice was gone.  

She sat at the edge of her bed.  Long after her acceptance, she had 
been lonesome.  She could never be in neither the human world or 
vampire world.  She did find Integra like a role model, extremely 
determined and persistent.  She once thought Integra even hated her.  &quot;I 
guess I ought to thank her for giving me my own room.&quot;  She smiled a 
bit, remembering the first time she saw her new four-poster coffin 
bed.  It was no luxury, but it was pretty fancy.  

------------------------------------------------------------

At precisely midnight, Ceras exited her room, closing the door behind 
her.  Silently walking down the hallway, she stopped at the front door 
of Integra&#39;s bedroom. If only she knew what she had in store for her.  
Still young, she had not the knowledge of travelling through portals 
the way her master could.  She knocked.  

&quot;Sir Integra?&quot;  

&quot;You may enter, Ceras.&quot;  Her voice was surprisingly soft, not like its 
usual cold tone at all.  Ceras entered the room, closing the door 
behind her.  She let out a gasp.  This was the first she was inside 
Integra&#39;s bedroom.  It was huge.  

She looked around, and finally spotted Integra, who was sitting on her 
bed.  Her bed.  It was as big as a master one.  It had the most 
beautiful quilts and sheets, and made of the finest wood.  Ceras 
realized how bright the room was, and looked at the huge window and 
saw a huge full moon.  Suddenly, she felt a strange sensation.  Her 
mind zoomed back to the her first meeting with Alucard, how he desired 
blood whenever there was a full moon.  Had she not drank all of her 
blood before leaving, she might have had a huge thirst, and it may not 
have been for medical blood.

&quot;Come over here.&quot;  Ceras could not see Integra, who was away from the 
moonlight.  She could make out her silhouette.  She walked to her 
side and sat down.  When Integra came into view, Ceras&#39; eyes widened 
and immediately all of her thoughts blackened.  Before her was Integra 
Wingates Hellsing herself, and for the first time, in women&#39;s night 
attire.  She was stunningly beautiful in white, without her glasses.  
Ceras was entirely speechless.  She had never seen Integra in any 
other clothing other than her suit.  She had never felt this way about 
a woman before.  

&quot;Sir....Sir....Integra...you....you..wanted....to...see..me?&quot;  The 
poor girl could barely make out her sentence.  

Integra lowered her face to Ceras&#39; level.  &quot;Does my nightgown surprise 
you, young police girl?  I am a woman after all.&quot;  Her blue eyes were 
no longer cold, but warm, entrapping the vampire girl.  

&quot;N-n-no...not...at...all..I mean, what do I know?  I hardly see you in 
anything else.&quot;  Ceras was still having the most immense emotion.  She 
felt she could melt under Integra&#39;s gaze.   

She nearly jumped when Integra brought a hand up to her face.  Ceras 
froze like a statue.  Never in her entire life had she had such an 
experience.  &quot;Just for tonight, and between the both of us, you may 
call me Integra,&quot; she spoke softly.  Ceras slowly nodded her head.  
&quot;Now, the reason I called you here, was because there is something I 
would like to know, something that I need to talk to you in private.  
I hope this is not inconvenient for you.&quot;  She smiled a bit.  

Ceras shook her head, indicating there was no other place she would 
rather be.  A soft stroke broke her thoughts.  

&quot;Tell me, do you find me attractive?&quot;  

Ceras felt her stomach churn.  &lt;That is just what Master asked me!  
Bloody hell!&gt;  She had to be truthful.  Taking a deep breath, she 
responded, &quot;Yes, Integra, I do.  I find you beautiful, and, if I 
may....I even find you beautiful in your suit.&quot;  She turned away and 
blushed.  

Integra was a bit surprised.  A young girl actually found her 
attractive? She did not know how to make of this.  &lt;Does this mean she 
is actually attracted to me?  Does she long to be my companion?&gt;  She 
slowly turned the young girl&#39;s head to face her.  Ceras struggled to 
stay still as her eyes locked with Integra&#39;s.  She was surprised to 
find her smiling.  &quot;Ceras, I never knew you felt that way about me.  I 
also find you attractive.  You are indeed an attractive young lady.&quot;  
Ceras felt her head spinning.  &quot;Do you wish to be my companion?&quot;  

Ceras thought for a moment, before responding, &quot;I honestly don&#39;t know 
how to answer, I mean, I do know I am attracted to you, but....&quot;  Then 
she felt she was contradicting herself.  &lt;No, that&#39;s a lie.  I do want 
to be with her, I want to be with her all the time.  I can turn to her 
other than Master.&gt;  She nodded her head.  

Integra smiled.  &quot;You know, Ceras, you are the very first person who 
has had that desire.&quot;  She leaned and gently planted a kiss on Ceras&#39; 
forehead.  Ceras felt her entire body burning like it was on fire.  

&quot;Integra....you just.....you just....&quot;  Integra let the vampire girl 
lay on her lap.  As she gently stroked her hair, Ceras calmed down.  
Her body regained its normal state.  &quot;Integra, I never showed any 
appreciation for you.  I was so scared you would reject me.  I wanted 
to thank you for my room.  I know I should have been more grateful for 
you giving me blood.  Without your acceptance, my life would have no 
meaning.  Without the blood you gave me, I might have suffered so 
much.  I have always had the desire to be near you.  You are the only 
other person besides Walter I wanted to get close too.  I have lost my 
father when I was young.  When I was dying in Master&#39;s arms, I felt I 
would be letting my father down if I made the choice I made now.  But I 
did it anyway.  And seeing you for the first time, I felt I had a 
chance to prove my skills and worth as part of Hellsing. I know you 
only see me as a vampire, but I don&#39;t care if I am.  You&#39;re so 
strong...the strongest person I have ever met....I should have 
followed you as someone I could look up to.  I....I really like 
you...Integra.&quot;  She was silent for a moment.  

Integra was a little struck by such compassionate words, words that 
were coming from a vampire.  But compared to Alucard, Ceras was like a 
gift from God, someone who was destined to be in the woman of steel&#39;s 
life, someone she could turn to for companionship.  Indeed, the 
vampire apprentice meant more to her than ever before.  &quot;Sergeant 
Ceras Victoria....my little human vampire....my little vampire....my 
friend.&quot;  She looked down at her new companion.  Ceras was awake, 
thinking about this fateful night.  &quot;If only you could open your heart 
to me,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I already have, Ceras.  You are worthy of 
being my friend.&quot;  

&quot;I feel Master&#39;s presence in here.&quot;  Ceras smiled proudly.  

&quot;Then I guess I would have to give him another lesson in privacy.  
He&#39;s been doing that since I was a child,&quot; Integra mused.  She had 
finally let go of her cold feelings towards the child of Alucard.  She 
had finally Ceras&#39; true feelings, and she had accepted.  

&quot;I will never do anything that would hurt you, Integra,&quot; Ceras 
whispered.  

&quot;Ceras?&quot;  The tone of her voice caused her to get up and looked at her 
face.  Without warning Integra leaned in and gave another 
kiss.....this time on her lips.  This was more than what Ceras could 
take, and she fainted into Integra&#39;s arms.  Gently laying her down on 
the bed, 
Integra watched as the policegirl slept, admiring her pretty face.  
&quot;You may sleep here tonight, Ceras.&quot;  

She looked closely at her, and suddenly, saw a sleeping image of 
herself as a child.  When she looked again, it was only Ceras.  
Nothing else was said as the Hellsing leader laid blanket over the 
vampire girl before laying down next to her.  Reaching out and 
stroking her face, she fell asleep.  

------------------------------------------------------------

Nearby inside the room, Alucard watched as the two Hellsing females 
slept, grinning.  &lt;So you have finally sensed my presence, Ceras 
Victoria.  Very impressive.  And it looks like my master is finally 
opening her heart.  This may be a good opportunity for me.&gt;  With one 
last glance, he left.
