<h1>Hidden Aspects</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Integra Hellsing strode down the hall, her business
suit perfectly resting on her slim body, her gray hair
falling around her strong face. She moved with
confidence and determination, though from the look on
her handsome face one could almost wonder if she was
facing some dire threat. Quietly she addressed her
companion, &quot;Are they still there?&quot;

Seres Victoria smiled faintly, the blonde keeping pace
with the other woman easily. &quot;According to Walter,
yes,&quot; she answered,

&quot;Crap,&quot; Integra muttered. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose the three
of you couldn&#39;t cook up some kind of emergency to get
me out of this?&quot;

&quot;Sorry ma&#39;am,&quot; Seres said quietly in reply, &quot;I think
you&#39;re stuck.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Integra puffed out a breath as they stood at
the door. &quot;All right, let&#39;s do this,&quot; she took a deep
breath and pushed open the door.

&quot;Miss Hellsing!&quot; the mob of children squealed as they
charged.

&quot;Ulp,&quot; Integra gulped then visibly stiffened in alarm
as the first little girl firmly clamped herself to her
leg, the other boys and girls looking up at her
adoringly as they gathered around the woman, seeking
her attention.

Seres had to smile as the children of the officers of
the Royal Order took Integra by the hands and drew her
into the room, the place brightly decorated for the
children&#39;s annual Easter party. Clearly Sir Hellsing
had no idea how to handle the children, and the
occasional look of pure terror on her face was just
priceless.

Integra looked at her desperately and mouthed the
word, &#39;Help!&#39;

Drawing on a youth spent baby-sitting in her
neighborhood Seres quickly took the boys and girl&#39;s in
hand, giving Integra some relief as she got them
organized in playing games. Thankfully Walter had
stocked the place with a lot of them, as well as the
baskets of treats she and Integra would be giving the
children later.

Integra felt a gentle tugging on her leg and looked
down at a grave faced little boy. &quot;Yes?&quot; she asked him
stiffly.

&quot;I gotta go potty,&quot; the black haired five year old
informed her seriously.

&quot;Of course you do,&quot; Integra sighed as she gently took
him by the hand and led him off. A humiliating few
minutes in the bathroom later and Integra returned to
the party only to stop in surprise at what she saw.

The little kids were gathered around Seres as she
gestured broadly, her red eyes twinkling with
amusement as the uniformed young woman cheerfully told
them a story. Sitting there on the floor in the middle
of her rapt audience Seres almost looked like a little
kid herself as she told them the story of Alice in
Wonderland. Watching her Integra again felt that
subtle beat of attraction between them, but fiercely
drove it away.

&#39;I&#39;m her commanding officer,&#39; Integra reminded
herself, &#39;it&#39;s just not possible.&#39;

Seres saw Integra return after a few moments, looking
up to meet eyes faintly clouded with desire. &quot;All
right everyone,&quot; she made herself look away from
Integra as she said to the kids impishly, &quot;it&#39;s
chocolate time!&quot;

&quot;Yay!&quot; the cheer probably could have been heard all
around headquarters.

&#39;Thank god the baskets are color coded,&#39; Integra
thought as she handed out pink ones to the girls and
blue ones to the boys.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; Seres said with a grin, passing out the
large chocolate bunnies. Carefully she didn&#39;t reveal
her fangs, though oddly the children didn&#39;t seem at
all nervous around her. &#39;Unlike their parents,&#39; she
mused.

There was a soft sound of a cleared throat and
everyone looked up as Walter stuck his head in. &quot;Sir
Integra,&quot; the older man nodded, &quot;it&#39;s time.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for inviting me to your party,&quot; Integra
told the children as she and Seres left, the regular
baby-sitters stepping in to take over.

&quot;See, that wasn&#39;t so bad,&quot; Seres said cheerfully as
they walked down the hall.

After checking to see if any of the kids were
following them Integra growled, &quot;I&#39;d rather face a
horde of vampires unarmed.&quot;

Seres looked over at her in surprise then asked, &quot;You
really don&#39;t like children that much?&quot;

Impatiently Integra said, &quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like
them, I just don&#39;t understand them.&quot;

Seres smiled winningly, &quot;Just remember what it was
like when you were a child.&quot;

Integra paused, about to turn on her way back to her
office and the paperwork that awaited her. &quot;I never
was a child in the way you mean,&quot; she answered, &quot;I was
running the Royal Order when I wasn&#39;t all that much
older than those kids.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Seres said after a moment.

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Integra answered with some amusement, &quot;and
you shouldn&#39;t be, either.&quot;

&quot;And did you have a Easter party like those children?&quot;
Seres asked softly.

&quot;No, it wasn&#39;t something I was interested in,&quot; Integra
said, &quot;excuse me.&quot; Head high and back straight she
strode away, leaving a thoughtful Seres Victoria
watching her go.

Sometimes Integra Hellsing found herself wondering at
the sheer amount of paperwork a organization like
theirs generated. In theory it should all be very
simple: sight a vampire, investigate the sighting and
then send in an agent to deal with it. However in
reality that involved signing off on police overtime,
vehicle requests, weapons authorizations and dozens of
other things, all in triplicate. And of course all of
that paperwork crossed Integra&#39;s desk at some point.

&#39;Wonder if I would get in trouble if I burnt it all?&#39;
Integra thought to herself whimsically as she tiredly
walked to her rooms. Pushing open her door she stopped
in the living room, eyes narrowing as she realized
someone had been in there why she was out. Drawing her
pistol from beneath her coat she scanned the room for
anything amiss, eventually noticing a piece of paper
left on her desk.

&quot;Happy Easter,&quot; it read in Seres typically poor
handwriting, &quot;there&#39;s ten pieces of chocolate hidden
in the room for you. Enjoy.&quot; Beneath was added, &quot;P.S.
And a plastic egg with a surprise.&quot;

&quot;Why that little...&quot; Integra growled, looking around
the room. Her first thought was just leaving the damn
candy, but she could easily imagine it going bad in
here. She could call in a soldier to look for them,
but that was mildly ridiculous. Asking Seres seemed
simplest, but by this time she was probably asleep....
&quot;Damn it.&quot;

The first few chocolates were easy to find, sitting by
a photo, a lamp and on top of her desk. Her pen holder
hid another, then she spotted a few on the carpet. Six
down, five to go. Searching around Integra found her
irritation quickly fading away and soon realized that
she was actually enjoying the search.

Another chocolate was on her telly, then two more were
in her sofa. Finally she found the last chocolate
hidden in her stereo, as well as a rose colored
plastic egg. It twisted apart easily, and yet another
note dropped into Integra&#39;s hands.

&quot;Your final Easter present,&quot; Seres wrote, &quot;is waiting
in the bedroom.&quot;

&#39;I wonder what else she&#39;s done?&#39; Integra thought as
she unwrapped a egg, popping the chocolate in her
mouth and confidently striding to her bedroom door.
Bracing herself for small children, vampires and other
hideous possibilities she opened the door... and froze
in surprise. Then burst out laughing.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I look that bad,&quot; Seres said mildly,
bunny ears flopping down from her head. The little
swimsuit hugged her body, pink like the ears, and a
adorable little puffy tail was attached to her butt.
She looked frighteningly cute... and sexy, with
fishnet stockings and heels, too.

Integra felt her heartbeat increase as she walked over
to the bed, her throat tight with a surge of desire as
she remembered the last time Seres had surprised her.
&quot;How did you manage this?&quot; she asked as she sat down
by the young woman.

Seres slid forward to kiss her gently, the kind of
intimate gesture that they only allowed in the bedroom
or in private. &quot;Walter helped,&quot; she admitted, &quot;in fact
he was pretty amused, too.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Integra laughed, laying on her side.
She reached out and Seres let herself be drawn down,
the two laying side by side. She kissed her again,
lingeringly, &quot;You make a pretty good Easter bunny,
Police Girl.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you, master,&quot; Seres purred. She grinned as
she snuggled close and purred suggestively, &quot;Would you
care to unwrap your last present?&quot;

&quot;I intend to enjoy all of it,&quot; Integra laughed.

End

Notes: Another mix of anime and manga Hellsings, more
or less, as well as a sequel to my more adulty fic
Blood and Roses. It seemed to make sense that Integra
might be nervous around kids, considering how young
she was when she became head of Hellsing.</pre>
