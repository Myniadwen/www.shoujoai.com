THE HOTEL PENTHOUSE, A FEW MINUTES PRIOR...

Rock and Moria Hedgley had returned to the penthouse after the maid, who 
was dressed casually but still carried-out her duties despite an injured 
hand. Many of those inside were busying themselves at various actions; 
Dutch and Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing looking over maps, 
trying to figure out where Natasha Radinov was hiding out.

On another table, Becky &#39;the Nose&#39; Farrah was hard at work on a laptop, 
but seemed to be struggling a bit. Benny had noticed this, and looked 
over the information expert&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Working on a comparative search 
pattern?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Well, at least trying to,&quot; Becky admitted. &quot;Sir Integra wanted to give 
the Roanapur Police some help in locating Radinov, so she asked me work 
the figures here.&quot; Taking a break, she leaned back on her chair, 
&quot;Unfortunately, I&#39;ve ran into a few glitches that I can&#39;t work out.&quot;

&quot;Well, let me take a hack at it, if you don&#39;t mind someone else working 
on your computer,&quot; the tech expert offered.

Not knowing what else to do, Becky slid the laptop over to Benny, who 
began to work over the figures. She did lean over as new figures came-up 
on the display. &quot;Hmm... didn&#39;t really think of using THAT algorithm,&quot; 
she said.

&quot;I imagined that,&quot; Benny laughed. &quot;I&#39;m guessing that this sort of thing 
wasn&#39;t exactly your expertise.&quot;

&quot;Not really. I&#39;m more-or-less an information hacker, but I stay out of 
the personal information. Avoids many bad returns that way.&quot; Becky 
continued to marvel how her new-found friend was compiling the 
information. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you have a girlfriend,&quot; she offered.

&quot;In a way,&quot; Benny said with a smile. &quot;Too bad she&#39;s mostly on the run, 
mainly because of her occupation. I keep in touch with Jane from 
time-to-time, though.&quot;

&quot;What is it that she does exactly?&quot; Becky asked.

&quot;Counterfeiting,&quot; answered Benny. That resulted in a raised eyebrow from 
Becky, as well as an understanding nod.

The doorbell chime sounded, prompting Moria to leave Rock&#39;s side to 
answer it. &quot;Why Miss Balalaika,&quot; she said in perfect Russian, &quot;what 
brings you here?&quot;

&quot;Mostly a social call,&quot; the crimelord said, &quot;not to mention offering 
some refreshment.&quot; She motioned one of the bellhops forward, wheeling a 
cart that had a steaming samovar on it. &quot;Sir Integra,&quot; she added, 
looking at the Hellsing leader, &quot;I do hope you like Earl Gray.&quot;

&quot;That sounds lovely,&quot; Sir Integra answered, motioning Balalaika over to 
the table where she and Dutch were. The bellhop soon followed, then 
left.

As Moria proceeded to serve the tea inside the samovar, Dutch looked 
over to his best customer and said, &quot;I must say this sure beats beer 
anytime - with none of the side effects.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Balalaika agreed. &quot;We are facing Bloody Pierce, after all. And 
to plan a proper response requires clear heads.&quot;

&quot;Miss Balalaika, I have noticed something,&quot; Sir Integra said, accepting 
the tea. &quot;Ever since we have come here, you have never called Radinov by 
her real name - just her alias. I was wondering why this is so.&quot;

The crimelord hesitated, as if remembering something unpleasant, before 
answering. &quot;You may have trouble believing this, looking at me... but I 
could never say that name without feeling some... trepidation. I will 
show you.&quot; She then pulled-back the right sleeve of her red business 
suit. There, high up on her forearm was a scar. But this was not like 
the scars upon Balalaika&#39;s face. For one thing, it was straight, and ran 
perpendicular to the length of the forearm.

&quot;Radinov did that?&quot; Sir Integra said, shocked.

Balalaika nodded. &quot;My men were not the only ones Bloody Pierce 
questioned their loyalty to the state and suffered for as a result. And 
just this morning, for the first time in many years, I had a nightmare 
about the experience.&quot;

Revy, who was leaning against the wall, looked at the scar, her eyes 
widening. &quot;Shit! I didn&#39;t think ANYTHING would rattle you, Sis!&quot;

&quot;We all have devils chasing us, Anego,&quot; the crimelord said plainly. &quot;I 
thought mine had died on the steps of a museum in Chicago. I clearly 
will not rest until the devil known as Bloody Pierce is permanently put 
to rest!&quot;

&quot;And I believe we&#39;ve got new tools to help you out!&quot; Becky said 
cheerfully, presenting the laptop she and Benny were working on. &quot;I&#39;ve 
got a new search pattern I think would help your men.&quot;

Balalaika, Dutch and Sir Integra looked over the new patterns. &quot;Very 
impressive, Miss Farrah,&quot; Sir Integra finally said.

&quot;So this might help us track that Radinov bitch better?&quot; Dutch added, 
looking at the display.

Becky placed a finger on her chin as she said, &quot;Well, I can&#39;t accept ALL 
the credit.&quot; She indicated to Benny and added, &quot;I ran into a little 
trouble about the manpower allocations and he just happened to come up 
with the solution.&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Sir Integra said as she went over the patterns, &quot;I believe 
that Seras might benefit from these new patterns. She has been feeling 
out-of-sorts after what had happened to Rally and this might be just the 
ticket she needs.&quot;

&quot;Oh I&#39;ll get her, Sir Integra,&quot; Moria said, heading for the Draculina&#39;s 
bedroom. She disappeared for a few minutes - then returned, clearly 
alarmed. &quot;Sir Integra - Seras isn&#39;t in her room! I&#39;ve checked her bed 
and it isn&#39;t slept in!&quot; She took a breath and added, &quot;I also checked her 
suitcase - her uniform&#39;s gone, too!&quot;

Everyone raced into the bedroom. The covers haven&#39;t been disturbed, and 
the suitcase also showed nothing more than her toiletries. Sir Integra 
bent over the case, a look of concern on her face. Balalaika and Revy 
also looked at the case, looking at each other. &quot;Hey Sis... you don&#39;t 
suppose that blonde went after that bitch herself?&quot;

&quot;I have no idea - but it does fit in,&quot; Balalaika added.

&quot;Maybe - but I do not believe Seras has any idea where Radinov is,&quot; Sir 
Integra observed. &quot;She is an excellent tracker, though. If properly 
motivated, she could possibly...&quot;

CRASH!!

The sound of the breaking lamp came from the room where Irene &quot;Rally&quot; 
Vincent was convalescing after her attack and mutilation by the hands of 
Radinov. Everyone raced inside, where they saw Rally, still dressed in 
her pajamas, struggling to get up after stumbling out of bed. &quot;Gotta get 
over there!&quot; she said, getting herself to her feet. &quot;I gotta save 
Master!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me?&quot; Dutch said, trying to guide the blinded 
vampire back into bed. &quot;You can&#39;t even see, let alone fight! Now I 
suggest you...&quot; but got cut-off when Rally shoved him back, almost 
sending him through the wall in doing so.

&quot;I don&#39;t need my eyes, buddy!&quot; Rally angrily shot back. &quot;I still have my 
&#39;third eye&#39;! I can use that and...AAAAUUUUGGGGHHHH!&quot; She then fell to 
her knees when a new spasm hit. For a few tense seconds, she remained 
kneeling - as well as breaking down and crying. &quot;No Master,&quot; she 
whimpered as she tried to get up, &quot;don&#39;t leave me alone... I don&#39;t want 
to be alone!&quot;

&quot;Rally,&quot; Sir Integra finally said, kneeling in front of her friend, 
&quot;what is it? Do you know where Seras is - and HOW do you know?&quot;

Rally didn&#39;t answer immedietly, instead groping around until she placed 
one hand against Sir Integra&#39;s head - and what the Hellsing leader had 
gotten nearly caused her to faint, if not scream outright! Images began 
flooding into her mind, obviously from the point-of-view of the 
Draculina. And those images were of Radinov, which Seras was fighting.

&quot;I may no longer be her fledgling,&quot; Rally gasped, &quot;but at least we still 
share... a link! I started getting these images a few minutes ago! I can 
see and hear everything she&#39;s going through right now... and it isn&#39;t 
good! Radinov is goading her, using her own insecurities about what 
happened to me against her! If I don&#39;t stop it... that bitch&#39;ll tear 
Master apart!&quot;

Unfortunately, Rally inadvertently shared something else with Sir 
Integra along with the images - namely the pain she was in. It seemed 
wave after wave of agony had wracked her whole being. Finally, Sir 
Integra had to force herself away, gasping for breath. &quot;Dear God...&quot; she 
managed to say, &quot;Rally... I never knew you were in so much pain! It must 
be agonizing for you right now!&quot;

&quot;Sorry Integra,&quot; Rally whispered, &quot;but at least it&#39;s about a thousand 
times better than yesterday. Now THAT was pain! What I was under...&quot; she 
flinched briefly, &quot;was more pain... than even the strongest human could 
endure without dying outright!&quot;

Moria was watching this from behind Sir Integra. Although silent, she 
could only look sympathetically, then thinking how much her perception 
of this vampire had changed from just a few months ago. Back then, she 
had feared vampires greatly, having to work around three of them. She 
remembered Rally&#39;s initial pursuit of her after she cleaned-up a rather 
embarrassing situation when Rally, still a fledgling vampire, threw-up 
while testing her limits. Then she remembered in shame how she cursed 
her daily, openly telling Rally how much she wanted her dead for good.

It was only after being saved from the child vampire Angela that Moria 
began to look at Rally with new eyes. &#39;If only I could find a way to 
make amends to you, my dear Rally,&#39; Moria thought to herself, &#39;then 
maybe... I could tell you about how I now feel about you... about... how 
much I&#39;m beginning to love you and your master!&#39;

&quot;Maybe so, Rally,&quot; Sir Integra continued, unaware of the maid&#39;s mental 
musings, &quot;but now I see that Alucard was right; I have let you suffer 
far too much! And now, from what you have shared with me, we stand to 
lose Seras if we - no, I, do not act now!&quot; She then proceeded to undo 
the tie around her neck.

Now Dutch was recovering from his little misadventure and noticed what 
the Hellsing leader was doing. &quot;Say Revy?&quot; he asked, &quot;Do you know what&#39;s 
going on?&quot;

&quot;I have an idea... but it&#39;s one I don&#39;t particularly like,&quot; the Chinese 
girl said.

Collins also noticed. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked.

Sir Integra ignored him, undoing the first two buttons of her shirt. 
&quot;Rally, listen to me,&quot; she began, &quot;I want you to take some of my blood!&quot;

Everybody gasped. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious!&quot; Collins said. &quot;We&#39;ve got 
enough blood in the refrigerator, you don&#39;t have to offer yours!&quot;

&quot;Yes I do!&quot; Sir Integra countered. &quot;That blood in the refrigerator just 
happens to be almost at the end of its usable life, perfect for 
sustaining a healthy vampire but useless for what she needs! In order 
for Rally to recover rapidly from the holy water&#39;s effects, she needs a 
massive quantity of fresh, warm blood to do it!&quot;

&quot;Then let me give her MY blood!&quot; Collins added. &quot;I&#39;m one of Rally&#39;s 
oldest friends, it should be me to do it!&quot;

&quot;NO!!&quot; Everyone was caught off-guard by the forcefulness of the Hellsing 
leader&#39;s voice. &quot;Agent Collins, your offer is most generous, but it is 
obvious you are not a virgin! If Rally took your blood, you will 
definitely become a ghoul as a result!&quot; Collins gulped audibly. &quot;I am 
still a virgin, which means I stand a better chance of surviving!&quot;

&quot;Or if I&#39;m careless,&quot; Rally added in shock, &quot;you&#39;ll end up a vampire 
like me! Integra, you can&#39;t offer yourself just for my sake!&quot;

&quot;I do not care anymore!&quot; Integra replied, almost to the point of tears. 
&quot;I know I made the promise to Seras that I would not follow her into 
darkness. But if saving her from that monster Radinov means breaking 
that promise then I will! Rally...&quot; but stopped when she felt a hand on 
her shoulder.

&quot;Then you don&#39;t have to break that promise,&quot; Moria said, looking at her 
employer. &quot;She can take my blood! I&#39;m a virgin, too, so she can have 
mine instead!&quot;

Sir Integra stood silently at the maid, trying to digest what she said. 
&quot;Miss Hedgley... why?&quot;

Moria then chose her words carefully. &quot;Sir Integra... when you assigned 
me the task of Rally and Seras&#39; care, it was possibly one the best 
things that had happened in my life. If I allowed you to do something I 
should be doing, then that means that I&#39;ve failed you trust.&quot; She then 
fondly looked at Rally and added, &quot;And besides, to do so would be an 
atonement of sorts - of the harsh and cruel things I did and said to her 
in the beginning.&quot; She then bent over to Rally, which she embraced her. 
&quot;Rally Vincent - for your sake - for the sake of your master, I offer my 
blood to you. Will you please take it?&quot;

&quot;Moria... are you sure of this?&quot; Rally asked.

The maid nodded, even though she knew Rally couldn&#39;t see it. &quot;I haven&#39;t 
been more sure than right now. Seras&#39; unlife is in danger, and I would 
gladly offer my own life for her if need be.&quot;

Rally just remained kneeled, taking in what her friend had said to her. 
&quot;Okay Moria... I accept your gift,&quot; she replied. &quot;Integra... could you 
give us a little privacy?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Rally,&quot; the Hellsing leader said. &quot;But please... do be careful.&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot; Sir Integra then motioned those gathered to leave, which they 
did. However, when Revy passed the two, she gave Moria a gentle tap on 
the shoulder. Surprised, the maid looked up - just to see Revy giving 
her the &#39;thumbs-up&#39;. She smiled back and nodded. Then the brown-haired 
girl became the last to leave the room, closing the door as she did.

&quot;Looks like we better get this over with,&quot; Rally said as she leaned 
closer to Moria, only to notice that the pretty brunette shaking, not to 
mention her breathing becoming ragged. &quot;Hey... you okay?&quot; she asked.

&quot;It-it&#39;s just that... I&#39;m so terrified!&quot; Moria sobbed out, tears 
streaming from her eyes. &quot;I feel like... I&#39;m about to die!&quot;

&quot;Hey-hey,&quot; Rally whispered, gently caressing her cheek, &quot;don&#39;t worry, 
you&#39;re not going to die, Moria. Look, I&#39;ll try to be as gentle as 
possible.&quot;

Moria shook her head. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter how I feel. Seras is all that 
matters. Just... try to make it as quick.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; However, before she could accept the gift of Moria&#39;s blood, she 
gave the trembling maid a long, deep kiss, mostly to ease her fears. 
When she was satisfied that her shaking had lessened, Rally braced 
herself - and quickly sunk her fangs into Moria&#39;s neck.

Moria cried out, the pain, while brief, was significant. Almost out of 
reflex, she held Rally tightly as the maid felt her life&#39;s blood being 
drained from her body. &#39;So odd... it could almost... be... 
pleasurable...&#39; she thought as she felt her vision fading.

ANOTHER PART OF ROANAPUR, THIRTY MINUTES LATER...

If it weren&#39;t for her altered body, Radinov could&#39;ve sworn that she 
might have been snapped in half, the way she hit the tree. For over an 
hour, the assassin and Seras Victoria had fought, but so far, neither 
woman had an advantage. &quot;I have to admit,&quot; she said to herself, rubbing 
her back, &quot;she is good. However, she is also growing more reckless by 
the minute! I just have to keep-up a few more minutes of this before...&quot;

&quot;YEEEEEEAAAAAAA!!&quot; Radinov had to move quickly to avoid the Draculina&#39;s 
latest attack, somersaulting out of the way. &quot;COME BACK HERE, YOU 
COWARD!!&quot; Seras shrieked, taking off after her.

However, the two combatants were so engrossed in their battle that they 
failed to notice a tall figure skulking about secretively. The figure 
did nothing, instead watching the two. But there was a slight glint in 
the center of his chest, as well as two glints around the eyes.

In the meantime, Radinov just bounced about, narrowly avoiding Seras&#39; 
slashes and kicks with practiced ease. &quot;So you say, child,&quot; she smirked. 
&quot;I say you are only trying to make up for yours - and Rally Vincent&#39;s 
defective natures.&quot;

&quot;SHUT UPPP!!&quot; This time, Seras&#39; punch connected on Radinov&#39;s jaw, 
sending her flying backward into the underbrush. &quot;Dammit!&quot; she cursed. 
&quot;I&#39;ve knocked her into the bushes again! I&#39;m getting bloody careless 
about this!&quot; Several bloody tears then showed up on the Draculina&#39;s 
face. &quot;Maybe she&#39;s right - I&#39;ve been doing everything wrong and... no 
Seras, don&#39;t listen to that bitch! You&#39;re letting your own stupid doubts 
cloud your judgment! Just try to relax your mind and you can get it 
done!&quot; Taking a few deep breaths to center herself, she proceeded 
forward.

Slowly, ever so slowly, Seras crept through the foliage, taking care to 
watch every step she made. At the same time, she kept her ears open for 
strange sounds. So far, nothing. Still, she pressed forward cautiously. 
At the same time, the figure shadowing her crept forward at the same 
pace.

It took the better of ten minutes for Seras to proceed through the 
underbrush until she broke through into a clearing. Her senses going 
into overdrive, she began to take in the environment around her - and 
that was when she noticed the mysterious individual watching her. &#39;Is 
that her?&#39; she thought to herself, making sure the stranger didn&#39;t 
notice.

WHUMP!!

As soon as it occurred, Seras collapsed to her knees, her crotch 
viciously kicked. &quot;Bloody... hell!&quot; she gasped, drawing up into a fetal 
position by the pain. &#39;She... must&#39;ve used the tip of that bloody boot!&#39; 
she thought, gritting her teeth. &#39;Bad enough she kicked me there... but 
it&#39;s worse when wearing... a clitoris ring!&#39;

&quot;Oh I DO apologize for that,&quot; Radinov smirked insincerely. &quot;I only 
wanted to get your attention, after all.&quot;

Seras finally managed to crane her head up. &quot;Well now you&#39;ve got it... 
bloody slag!&quot; she snarled, managing to get up. &quot;You&#39;ve probably done the 
same thing to Rally! I hate people like you, resorting to cheap tricks 
like sneaking up from your opponents from behind and kicking them in 
their privates!&quot;

Radinov just shrugged. &quot;Whatever works, I guess. However, I&#39;ve noticed 
you&#39;ve got some mouth on you for such a young thing! Perhaps I should 
shut it... permanently!&quot; Quickly, she lunged at Seras, only to have the 
Draculina move out of the way, somehow accomplishing a vault over the 
assassin&#39;s shoulders despite the pain in her groin.

Just about as quickly, Seras then went for a take-down, hoping to have 
Radinov on the ground in order to snap her neck. But just before she 
could sweep her legs, Radinov managed to kick her leg backward, again 
connecting into Seras&#39; crotch. The young vampire once again cried-out in 
pain, with Radinov pinning her down. &quot;You know, it doesn&#39;t have to be 
this way, little one,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#39;re very good, possibly the best 
I&#39;ve ever seen. If you&#39;re interested, you can become my apprentice. 
Think about it... we can be the finest team of contract assassins 
anywhere in the world.&quot;

All she got was Seras spitting in her face. &quot;GET... BENT!!&quot; she 
screamed, only to have Radinov viciously back-hand her face.

&quot;Little ingrate,&quot; the assassin hissed as she wiped her face, &quot;you&#39;ll pay 
for that!&quot; Then a wicked grin came over her face, &quot;You know... I&#39;ve got 
a little theory I&#39;d like to test.&quot; She then produced her last bottle of 
holy water. &quot;I&#39;ve seen what happens when you inject this into a 
vampire&#39;s body... but I wonder what would happen when a vampire drinks 
it!&quot; As soon as she undid the top, she went to pour the water into 
Seras&#39; mouth. However, her prospective victim decided the best defense 
was to clamp-down on her jaws, forcing Radinov to try to force them 
open.

&quot;Grrrr... OPEN YOUR MOUTH, YOU LITTLE BITCH!!&quot; Radinov yelled, resorting 
to pummeling Seras&#39; head with her fist several times. It took five or 
six blows before the Draculina was beaten senseless. Sensing her 
victory, the assassin then opens the mouth, prepares to pour the holy 
water - then gets a fist in the jaw, so hard that Radinov is sent flying 
into a nearby clump of bushes.

Finally recovering her senses, Seras shook her head to try to clear the 
cobwebs from them. Looking up, she could discern what appeared to be a 
form in dark clothing looking towards the area where Radinov landed. 
However, because of her beating she had trouble focusing her eyes on her 
apparent savior. One thing she did know, though - this figure didn&#39;t 
have Radinov&#39;s red hair.

Then the figure turned to the prone Draculina, an apparent orange-red 
glow coming from the eyes. &quot;MASTER, ARE YOU ALRIGHT!?&quot; the voice - Rally 
Vincent&#39;s voice - called out.

&quot;R-Rally? Is... is that you?&quot; Finally, Seras&#39; vision cleared itself, 
revealing Rally&#39;s form, dressed in her standard Hellsing garb - and 
completely healed, right down to the eyes.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s me, Master,&quot; Rally said with a smile.

Rather unsteadily, Seras rapidly got herself on her feet and hugged her 
servant. &quot;Oh thank goodness you&#39;re alright, I was so worried!&quot; But then 
she studied Rally&#39;s face, which included her newly-regenerated eyes, 
&quot;But I don&#39;t understand it Rally, you were in such a bad state it 
would&#39;ve taken you at least two weeks to heal!&quot;

&quot;Well... it may have,&quot; Rally began, &quot;but you really have to thank 
someone else for helping me out - namely Moria.&quot;

&quot;Moria?&quot; Seras looked at Rally&#39;s face - then made the connection. &quot;OH MY 
GOD!?&quot; the Draculina gasped in horror, &quot;RALLY, PLEASE TELL ME YOU 
DIDN&#39;T... NOT POOR MORIA!?&quot;

&quot;Hey chill-out, Master,&quot; Rally chuckled, &quot;I didn&#39;t kill Moria, nor made 
her my fledgling.&quot; She placed both hands on Seras&#39; shoulders and added, 
&quot;I only took as much blood as I needed to kick the holy water in my 
system, so don&#39;t worry about Moria, she&#39;s still human!&quot;

&quot;Whew! You&#39;ve had me concerned for a minute, Rally!&quot;

&quot;Not as concerned as someone else when you went off and faced Radinov by 
yourself,&quot; added Rally.

Seras then looked confused for a second, but then a look of realization 
hit - followed by one of worry. &quot;I&#39;m in trouble with Integra, am I, 
Rally?&quot; she said glumly.

Rally nodded. &quot;Hey don&#39;t worry - I won&#39;t let you face her alone, Master. 
I&#39;ll will always back you up, no matter what happens.&quot;

Of course, both vampires were so involved with themselves, they failed 
to notice an angry Radinov picking herself from the bush she landed. &quot;So 
Rally Vincent has healed,&quot; she grumbled, rubbing the spot where Rally 
had struck her. &quot;Well, I hate to interrupt this touching moment, but I 
will not let this insult pass so easily!&quot; Screaming loudly, she drew a 
shotgun from her coat and charged the two.

Hearing the shout, Rally took up a protective stance in front of Seras, 
ready for battle - until a shadow behind them caught her attention, 
followed by a barrage of gunfire directed at Radinov. Turning around, 
both vampires discovered that Revy was on the attack, grinning 
maniacally as she peppered the assassin with shot after shot. 
Frantically, Radinov turned to where the Chinese girl had landed and 
returned fire, only to have her move and fire again, quickly changing 
clips as she did. Quickly deciding to retreat, Radinov raced out into 
the underbrush.

&quot;I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU NOT TO FOLLOW ME, REVY!!&quot; Rally yelled at the 
newcomer, who landed between the vampires and where Radinov had fled.

&quot;Maybe you should talk to Dutch and ask him how many times HE told me 
that,&quot; Revy said in a low voice. &quot;I&#39;m not exactly one to do like I&#39;m 
told, y&#39;know. Besides, I wanted to get in my licks on that fucking bitch 
for what she did to you.&quot; She then unloaded one of her Berettas and held 
up the clip. &quot;And I wouldn&#39;t have done it without these special bullets 
I found, after all.&quot;

Rally eyed the clip, recognizing the rounds. &quot;Those are Hellsing 
standard mercury-tipped rounds, the same my dad uses!&quot; Eyeing Revy, she 
growled, &quot;You stole them from him, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Look, I was low on rounds, so don&#39;t fucking bite my head off!&quot; Revy 
snapped. &quot;Besides,&quot; she added, &quot;I&#39;ve softened her up for you, so you 
better be grateful.&quot; Revy then noticed something else - something 
Radinov had dropped when she charged Rally and Seras. &quot;Well look at what 
we&#39;ve got here,&quot; she smirked, picking up the object. It was the FREAK 
chip Revy had originally stolen, then in turn stolen by Radinov. &quot;Here,&quot; 
she said, tossing the object to Seras, &quot;it&#39;s yours, after all.&quot;

Seras looked at the pirate oddly. &quot;You could&#39;ve kept this for yourself, 
after all.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Revy shrugged, &quot;but if I did, it possibly would&#39;ve fucking 
cursed us. World doesn&#39;t need anyone like that bitch.&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; Rally added. &quot;Look, I&#39;m going to go after Radinov and make 
sure she doesn&#39;t get off the island,&quot; she then walked-up to Seras, &quot;but 
before I do, there&#39;s something I must do first.&quot;

&quot;Oh? What is it?&quot; the Draculina asked.

Rally then knelt down on one knee and bent down her head. &quot;Master,&quot; she 
began, &quot;I ask your permission - allow me to use the tools at my disposal 
to destroy my enemy.&quot;

Revy just frowned at this display, but smiled anyway when Seras knelt 
before Rally to face her. &quot;You do not need my approval, Rally,&quot; she 
said, planting a small kiss upon her lips. &quot;Go ahead - make that woman 
suffer for all she did.&quot;

&quot;Yes, my master!&quot; Rally said, grinning before bounding into the 
undergrowth.

But as soon as the dusky vampire had disappeared into the brush, Revy 
began to follow. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you?&quot; Seras cautioned.

&quot;Why not?&quot; Revy smirked, wondering if it was some challenge.

&quot;It&#39;s for your own good,&quot; the Draculina continued, looking kindly at 
her. &quot;I gave Rally permission to use as much of her full power against 
Radinov. From what I&#39;ve heard from Master Alucard, a vampire who 
ventures so much into their own darkness - like Rally is about to do - 
could become more of a danger to others, not to mention the sight of it 
might not to be of your liking.&quot;

Oddly enough, Revy returned the smile, saying, &quot;Hey, I appreciate the 
warning but I haven&#39;t came all this way just to miss the biggest 
ass-kicking that I&#39;ll ever see. In fact, if what I&#39;m about to see makes 
the original &#39;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#39; look like,&quot; she chuckled at the 
thought of what she was about to say, &quot;&#39;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&#39;, 
then it will definitely be worth the price of admission!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a pretty jaded statement, if you ask me,&quot; Seras answered, 
looking somewhat annoyed.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Revy added, jerking a thumb behind them, &quot;there&#39;s still the 
fucker trailing us. I happened to notice him before I came here.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Seras gasped. &quot;I thought it was you!&quot;

&quot;Oh who cares who the dumb-fuck is, let&#39;s get going. Now don&#39;t worry, 
I&#39;ll make sure we&#39;re at a safe distance before the shit hits the fan!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not really certain if your idea of &#39;safe distance&#39; is far enough,&quot; 
the Draculina sighed, following the pirate.

As they left, the individual following them closed in, chuckling as he 
did.

THE HOTEL PENTHOUSE...

&quot;Well, how is she, Rock?&quot; Dutch asked, watching the former salaryman. 
Near him, the others watched.

Rock was very careful as he examined Moira, who was asleep on the bed 
that formerly was Rally&#39;s. As he felt the pulse on her wrist, he tried 
without success not to look at the bite wounds on the maid&#39;s neck. &quot;Her 
pulse is strong,&quot; he said, &quot;and from the look of it, she&#39;s breathing 
normally. I have a good feeling she&#39;s going to recover.&quot;

&quot;All the same,&quot; Sir Integra added, looking on with Balalaika, &quot;I will 
have Dr. Trevelyan look her over once we return to London. Now if none 
of you mind, I will be going outside.&quot;

Balalaika followed Sir Integra outside, the two of them looking onto the 
nighttime sky. Presently, the Hellsing leader reached inside her coat 
pocket to retrieve her cigar holder - only to find it empty, much to her 
discouragement. But just then, a cigar was held in front of her, with 
Balalaika holding it. &quot;Here,&quot; the crimelord said, &quot;just for you.&quot;

Sir Integra looked at the cigar. &quot;It is Cuban, is it not?&quot;

&quot;Now this isn&#39;t the time for semantics, Sir Integra,&quot; Balalaika replied. 
&quot;Just an offering for a friend.&quot;

&quot;I guess you are right,&quot; Sir Integra sighed. Trimming the end, she found 
her lighter and lit up. &quot;If the prognosis from Mr. Okajima stands, I 
believe Moria should wake up in the morning. She must have been terribly 
frightened at the prospect of losing her blood to a vampire.&quot;

&quot;All soldiers have fear on the battlefield, my friend,&quot; Balalaika 
observed. &quot;She was afraid yes... but Miss Hedgley was possibly braver 
than many of us.&quot;

&quot;Yes. By the way, Mr. Vincent had told me that a quantity of his 
ammunition came up missing, not to mention Miss Xiang is not here, 
despite Rally&#39;s warning not to follow.&quot;

Balalaika let out a small laugh. &quot;I would not worry about Anego,&quot; she 
said. &quot;If the cost of the ammunition is a problem, I will make it up to 
you personally. I just hope your friend is successful in confronting 
Bloody Pierce, though.&quot;

&quot;My thoughts exactly, Miss Balalaika,&quot; Sir Integra added. However, she 
thought to herself, &#39;But I am worried about Rally. If I do not miss my 
guess, she may go after Radinov using her full power - and she doesn&#39;t 
have Alucard&#39;s control restrictions! I just hope we do not lose here if 
she taps the darkness within her!&#39;
