<h1>Blood and Roses</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Suddenly Sir Integra Hellsing slammed her hand down on the top of her 
desk, sending the pens and any other small objects flying as her blue 
eyes flashed behind her round glasses and silver while hair in mild 
disarray. &quot;Get the hell out of my office,&quot; she roared at them, &quot;and 
don&#39;t come back unless you&#39;ve got some results!&quot;
 
Seres Victoria could almost feel herself wilt under the other woman&#39;s 
glare, but her master took it quite calmly. &quot;But of course,&quot; Alucard 
smiled, his red suit and overcoat rich in the dim room, then with a bow 
he lead Seres outside.
 
&quot;Master, is it me or did Integra seem... grouchier than usual?&quot; Seres 
asked him nervously as they walked away from the office.
 
Alucard just ignored that question, instead smiling faintly as they came 
up to an older man in the hallway. &quot;Walter,&quot; he nodded to him slightly.
 
&quot;How is Sir Integra?&quot; Walter asked him, his thinning hair and fine 
clothes making him look much like the perfect butler. Of course much of 
that was an illusion, the older man a former agent of the Order of Royal 
Protestant Knights and &#39;Angel of Death.&#39;
 
&quot;You&#39;d best bring her some chocolate if you have to see her,&quot; Alucard 
advised him wryly then added thoughtfully, &quot;as well as a midol, maybe.&quot;
 
&quot;Ah,&quot; Walter nodded his understanding even as they heard Integra off in 
the distance, yelling at yet another hapless officer. Noting Seres&#39; 
questioning look he smiled at her faintly, &quot;I believe it&#39;s that time of 
the month.&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?&quot; Seres blinked in surprise.
 
Alucard chuckled softly as he looked down at her, &quot;I would think of the 
three of us you&#39;d be the most familiar with this.&quot;
 
There was a blank look on Seres&#39; face then her eyes widened as she clued 
in, &quot;Sir Integra?!&quot; She shook her head as she murmured, &quot;I didn&#39;t think 
she even had periods, much less PMS.&quot;
 
&quot;She is human, girl.&quot; Alucard noted, &quot;though it&#39;s easy to forget at 
times.&quot;
 
From up the hall more yelling erupted, along with desk thumping and 
possibly a thrown object. &quot;Let&#39;s hope it happens soon,&quot; Walter winced.
 
As Alucard and Seres headed off together, leaving poor Walter to go off 
and face the fearsome Integra all alone, the elder vampire said to her, 
&quot;Police girl, it would be best for you to leave Sir Integra alone once 
it starts.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh?&quot; Seres looked up at him curiously.
 
The halls of the fortress rang with the soft sound of their footsteps as 
Alucard continued, &quot;To our senses Integra will smell of blood, no matter 
how she tries to hide it.&quot; A twisted smile, &quot;It can be quite a 
temptation.&quot;
 
&quot;Of course Master,&quot; Seres nodded, her blonde hair falling into her red 
eyes.
 
They reached Seres&#39; rooms, the tall man smiling faintly in thought. &quot;Get 
some rest,&quot; Alucard ordered her firmly, &quot;and eat, as well.&quot; With a stern 
look he added, &quot;If you do not feed, I may have to ask Integra to take 
steps again.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; a faint blush colored Seres cheeks as she remembered her 
encounter with the intense young woman. Looking quite amused, as if he 
knew where her thoughts had taken her, the vampire Alucard just seemed 
to disappear.
 
Inside the packet of medical blood waited for her as usual as Seres 
walked into her rooms, sitting there in the middle of her suite in a 
bowl of ice to help keep it fresh. Striding across the room she sat down 
at the wooden table, tearing it open and pouring the blood out into a 
bowl before taking a spoon and drinking away.
 
Seres knew that many of the staff thought that she was a bit odd 
drinking her blood this way, especially considering that her master 
Alucard simply drank his right out of the packet. For her it was simply 
a attempt to retain some illusion of normality, to resist her vampire 
nature in whatever small ways that she could.
 
Trying to explain the flavor of the blood, the unique taste, Seres 
couldn&#39;t seem to manage. &#39;Not that I&#39;ve been asked,&#39; the bitter thought 
occurred to her as she got up, walking towards her bed. It troubled her 
at times, the isolation that she lived in, but usually she accepted it 
as the cost of her continued existence.
 
Stripping down to just a nightshirt and panties Seres lay down in her 
coffin as she felt the sleepiness washing over her, the feeling that 
swiftly came on with the coming of the dawn. She could function in the 
twilight hours a little, but it wasn&#39;t easy for her and it involved 
resisting her body&#39;s instincts to sleep. Today, however, she wasn&#39;t even 
going to try to fight it, instead letting the unnatural slumber wash 
over her.
 
*blood*
 
The memories came easiest while sleeping, both good and bad cascading 
through her mind without stopping. The training as a police woman, being 
adopted by the guys in the unit, all their good times together... then 
that damned village. The vicar, the village.. it all became a horror 
show as her unit was slaughtered, only luck and speed saving her.
 
Alucard had arrived when death seemed certain, then he killed her. The 
bullet through her lung killed the vicar, then he had offered her a 
devil&#39;s bargain.. the chance to survive if he turned her,. He had been 
surprisingly gentle as Alucard drew her into his arms, the fangs 
piercing her neck as he drained her, then something else, darker rushing 
in to replace the blood.
 
*blood...*
 
Another memory.. Seres had refused to drink the life giving blood at 
first, chosen to try to lie to herself that she was human It had been 
Sir Integra that had finally took matters into her own hands and her 
life, too. Seres wondered if Integra knew that when she had cut her 
finger, spilling blood for Seres to drink, how hard it had been to 
control herself. Hunger and need had raged in Seres, only her will 
keeping her from attacking the other woman.
 
Her tongue had flicked out, gently catching a few drops, then Seres had 
given in. Lapping away at first she cleaned the blood away as her mid 
clouded with pleasure, then gently sucked o the extended finger. It 
might have been her imagination but Seres had almost thought that she 
had heard fondness in her voice as Integra warned her not to bite.
 
*blood.....*
 
It was the scent that fully woke her, a spicy warm kind of scent that 
was achingly familiar to Seres. Getting up as if sleepwalking Seres 
stumbled towards the bathroom, her instincts guiding her as much as her 
conscious mind. There were sounds in there, someone talking to 
themselves, and Seres cautiously pushed open the door to look.
 
&quot;God damned stupid piece of...&quot; the silvery haired woman complained, 
digging through the open drawers of the bathroom, her white shirt the 
only covering that she wore.
 
&quot;Sir Integra?&quot; Seres asked softly, her mouth feeling full of cotton as 
she felt her eyes falling to the woman&#39;s thighs, the blood splattered 
there. Virgin blood, her wondrously sensitive nose told her, her heart 
beating faster.
 
Realizing where Seres was looking Integra didn&#39;t seem embarrassed, 
instead she said irritably, &quot;My period finally came, and I&#39;m out of 
pads, damn it.&quot; She shut it and opened another, &quot;I hoped someone else 
might have them.&quot;
 
Seres&#39; nose seemed to twitch as the scent of blood filled her mind, her 
slim body moving without her willing it forward. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; her voice 
came out a bit husky as she continued, &quot;I don&#39;t have periods anymore...&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ll have to improvise something,&quot; Integra muttered as she pushed a 
drawer shut, &quot; at least until I can send Walter into town to get some.&quot; 
Seres was right in front of her, gazing with dreamy eyes and the other 
woman narrowed her eyes, &quot;Seres, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;
 
Instead of answering Seres&#39; knees seemed to collapse, dropping her to 
the floor in front of Integra, who&#39;s sleep clouded mind was rapidly 
clearing. Crawling forward with inhuman speed Seres zeroed in on the 
still gently flowing blood, pressing her face to the white skin to lap 
at the red stained flesh, fighting down the urge to bite.
 
&quot;What the hell....&quot; Integra nearly staggered until Seres grasped her 
hips, steadying her with a gentle but firm grip as her surprisingly 
raspy tongue cleaned her skin.
 
The taste was like ambrosia to Seres, so different than the whole blood 
she usually drank, and still warm from the body it came from. Firmly 
gripping the squirming Integra&#39;s thighs and ignoring the weakening blows 
against her head she cleaned her skin lovingly, blindly seeking more. 
From mid thigh she worked her way up, stroking skin even as she felt the 
blows come to a stop.
 
Integra moaned as she leaned against the bathroom counter, legs too 
rubbery to hold her up. Unconsciously she felt herself spreading her 
legs, a tongue that was far too knowing stroking sweetly between her 
legs. The lips and tongue flowed up her skin, stroking clean her flesh, 
then parted those hidden lips....
 
Seres pressed her face close as more redness gushed, sucking and lapping 
it up gently. Her hands moved without thinking, thumbs firmly drawing 
the lips aside so that she could delve deeper, noticing another sweet 
fluid mixing with the blood, giving it a new flavor. Her tongue touched 
the hymen but she deliberately left it alone, careful not to break that 
final barrier.
 
Integra moaned then cried out again as she came, legs tightening around 
Seres&#39; head. Her breath came in gasps, eyes heavy lidded as the little 
blonde smoothly brought her up to the peaks again, her questing tongue 
always seeming to find the sweet spots. Part of her wanted to melt right 
then, and another wanted it to go on forever...
 
The tugging finally registered on Seres and she pulled back, squatting 
there submissively at Integra&#39;s feet. It took a moment before her blood 
lust finally cleared and her brain began to work, then the already pale 
woman went white as what had just happened registered. &quot;Sir Integra,&quot; 
she said softly, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I didn&#39;t mean....&quot;
 
Integra reached down and grabbed Seres by the shoulder, gently pulling 
up the other woman. &quot;Shut up,&quot; she said huskily, a finger reaching out 
to gently stroke along Seres&#39; cheek where a bit of red remained, tinting 
her lips.
 
&quot;Sir Integra?&quot; Seres said softly.
 
Smoothly Integra drew Seres close, pressing their lips together in an 
intense kiss, not minding the faint taste of blood in the vampire&#39;s 
mouth. &quot;If you ever tell Alucard about this,&quot; her breath stirred Seres&#39; 
ear, &quot;you&#39;ll regret it.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Seres squeaked.
 
Keeping a firm grip on the young vampiress Integra headed down the hall. 
Over her shoulder she barked, &quot;Come on.&quot;
 
&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Seres stumbled to keep up, wondering if she was in trouble and 
if so how much.
 
Integra flashed a smile as she said suggestively, &quot;I usually bleed for a 
few days.&quot;
 
Seres&#39; eyes widened a bit, her cheeks going red once more. Shyly she 
asked, &quot;Do you think I could.. help you keep clean?&quot;
 
&quot;Please,&quot; Integra purred.
 
The End
 
Notes: This idea kind of bit me and wouldn&#39;t let go. The concept that a 
vampire would be drawn to a woman who was having her period made sense, 
and it occurs to me that it might explain why there were no other women 
in Hellsing. The continuity is mostly the anime version, though I&#39;m 
using the manga version of Integra.</pre>
