<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Reloaded (part 11 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../hellsing/bshbreload-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Long shadows stretched out from the buildings in
Ohtori Academy as the sun set and the nude Utena
stirred from her slumber, and the hunger for blood
awakened inside of her breast as well. The girls all
seemed to wake almost at the same time she did, and
were aware of what was happening. They all huddled
together for a moment, and Utena felt a bit of relief
on insisting that they dress and go attend their
classes again.

But each night they all returned here, to be with her.

A brown haired girl separated from the group even as
the others left them alone in the bed room.
&#147;Utena-sama,&#148; she smiled, bowing, her short brown hair
falling around her face, &#147;my name is Hitomi.&#148; The
smaller girl reached up to begin to unbutton her
shirt, and Utena placed a hand on hers to gently stop
her.

&#147;Are you sure you want to do this?&#148; Utena asked her
softly, meeting brown eyes with her blue ones.
Standing this close she could smell the heat of the
girl, hear the blood pulse in her veins but she held
herself back with a nearly supernatural force of will.

Hitomi looked up into her eyes and Utena was startled
to see a hunger in them that almost matched her own.
&#147;Please,&#148; Hitomi simply said softly. Utena silently
took her hand in hers and pulled her towards the
nearby bed.

Stopping beside the bed Hitomi gracefully slipped her
shoes and socks off, then she slowly unbuttoned her
blouse, slowly teasing as each snap opened to reveal a
lacy bra. Her bottom wiggled enticingly as she slid
the short uniform skirt down, and then she reached
around to undo her bra and pull her pink panties down.

Standing there nude and painfully vulnerable Hitomi
asked her softly, &quot;Am I pleasing to you, Master?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Utena murmured, feeling her eyes
walking over Hitomi&#39;s slim form. The only thing that
marred her fragile beauty where the fading scars on
her arms, the remnants of Touga&#39;s bleeding of her.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hitomi blushed sweetly as Utena sat them
both down on the side of the bed, leaning over to kiss
her gently.

Salty skin and cool flesh came together as Utena&#39;s
arms slid up to encircle her, and a part of her mind
noted the vivid contrast between her own bone pale
skin and the healthy pink glow of the other girl&#39;s.
But mostly she was concerned with the hunger that was
surging within her, ad the blood like ambrosia that
flowed in Hitomi&#39;s veins

Tugging on Utena gently Hitomi lay back on the bed,
her eyes made cloudy with her intense desire. &#147;Oh now,
Utena-sama,&#148; she murmured to her softly, &#147;please,
now.&#148; She arched her back, making her upper body
available for Utena&#39;s every whim, the small globes of
her breasts standing upright and firm.

&#147;Forgive me,&#148; Utena murmured back softly before
bending over to gently run her mouth over the curve of
Hitomi&#39;s breasts, pleased to feel the nipples harden.
She lapped at the hot skin, the blood rising beneath
the surface as Hitomi mewled in pleasure. Then with a
gentle nip of her teeth the skin parted, and a rush of
sweet blood filled her mouth.

Hitomi cried out softly, her hands rising to cup
behind Utena&#39;s head, firmly holding her mouth to the
wound. Utena tentatively stroked at the breasts, and
Hitomi&#39;s soft cries of pleasure grew louder. A bit
nervously, Utena let a hand slide down the tight
belly, reaching the patch of curly hair, where she
stopped, waiting for some sign.

The last time she fed Utena had been delirious with
hunger as she fell into bed with Motoko, her desires
granting her a bold courage. All of the hidden
fantasies she had harbored as a young lady had boiled
up in that night of passion, and she had been faintly
stunned as Motoko met her wild needs with her own.
Now, though, her mind was mostly clear.. and she
wouldn&#39;t take Hitomi without her permission.

&#147;Please,&#148; Hitomi asked again, no, she moaned it in a
voice laced with desire and Utena let her fingers
slide into wetness.

It was a strangely thrilling experience for Utena,
stroking that damp flesh, learning the spots that made
Hitomi cry out. In only a few moments fingers and
mouth could make the lovely girl writhe o the sheets,
squirming with passion, and Utena could feel her own
hunger pounding in her temples. Still she waited until
Hitomi was about to reach her peak, was about to
climax again.. and bit.

&quot;Ahh,&quot; Hitomi cried as she came, the rush of blood
from her breast making her sensations even more
intense than before.

&lt;0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0&gt;

Outside in the dorm room Wakaba glared at the leader
of Utena&#39;s girl groupies. `At least they&#39;re all
wearing clothes,&#39; she thought to herself irritably. &#147;I
want to see Utena,&#148; she growled, &#147;so would you please
get out of my way?&#148; She made to step forward, only to
be stopped gently.

&#147;She&#39;s... a bit occupied right now,&#148; Keiko smiled.

&#147;What do you mean, occupied?&#148; Wakaba asked. Just then
a particularly loud cry reached them, and Wakaba&#39;s
eyes grew wide.

&#147;Sorry,&#148; Keiko said to her quietly.

&#147;I&#39;ll think I&#39;ll wait,&#148; Wakaba sighed. She blinked,
looking around curiously and realized that one of the
women was missing, &quot;Where&#39;s Motoko Aoyama?&quot;

&quot;The kendo hall,&quot; the blue haired girl offered,
pushing up her glasses, &quot;she had something she needed
to do there.&quot;

Not long after that a fully dressed Hitomi stumbled
out of the dorm room, stars dancing in her eyes. The
other girl&#39;s circled her, and she gushed, &#147;Utena-sama
was incredible!&#148;

Wakaba visibly winced at that.

Utena walked out of the room a few moments later,
pulling her uniform jacket on. She paused in the
doorway, &#147;Wakaba?&#148;

Wakaba looked at her steadily, trying to keep her
composure then she suddenly burst into tears. She felt
strong arms enfold her, and a quiet voice asking her
what was wrong. And all Wakaba could seem to manage to
say to her was, &#147;Why not me?&#148;

Utena pushed her back gently, her blue eyes
questioning. &#147;What?&#148; she asked her softly, as if
unsure of what she had heard.

&#147;Why not me, Utena?&#148; Wakaba asked her tearfully.

Utena closed her eyes for a moment, then opened them.
Quietly, &#147;Because I care for you too much. I&#39;d never
hurt you,. Wakaba.&#148; She leaned forward, and gently lay
a chaste kiss on Wakaba&#39;s forehead. Then, she was
gone.

Anthy watched them from nearby, her expression grave.
Equally quietly, she made her way down the dark
hallway, lost in her thoughts.

`Why does it bother me, to hear her say that?&#39; Anthy
thought, remembering the look in Utena&#39;s eyes as she
said those words. No one in Anthy&#39;s memory had ever
said something like that to her. And the caring in her
eyes, her voice!

`Tenjou Utena is a most unusual vampire,&#39; Anthy
thought.

&lt;0o0o0o0o0o0o0o&gt;

Utena walked the grounds of Ohtori on her regular
patrol. She had only found one or two vampires so far,
but the night was still young. `And Kanae is still out
there,&#39; she thought grimly. Something, some flicker of
motion, brought itself to her attention.

Without turning around Utena said, &#147;Good evening,
Juri.&#148;

Falling into step beside her, Juri smiled, &#147;Good
evening to you, too. Could I invite you back to my
dorm room?&#148;

Utena shook just a bit, remembering the wild night she
had shared with Juri, the pleasures that both of them
had experienced. &#147;No, thank you,&#148; she said quietly and
with just a bit of regret. She saw a look of
disappointment quickly appear, then disappear on
Juri&#39;s face. Softly, she asked, &#147;Why do you want me,
Juri? I&#39;m sure there are armies of girls here that
want you badly.&#148; A little smile, &#147;What makes me so
special?&#148;

&#147;Armies of girls,&#148; Juri echoed, adding with a little
smile, &#147;I guess that&#39;s the problem.&#148; They reached one
of the benches in the rose garden, &#147;Sit for a moment?&#148;

&#147;All right,&#148; Utena agreed warily, sitting down. Juri
gave her some space, taking the other end of the
bench, and Utena felt a little twinge of
disappointment. She looked out across the garden, the
flowers almost black in the night and sadly remembered
what they had looked like in the sunlight.

Juri looked up, the moonlight making her look almost
like a marble statue. &#147;When I first became a vampire,
I made a strange discovery. I found that after a
little time anyone I spoke to would begin to agree
with me,&#148; she said. A impish little smile crossed her
face, &#147;At first, I enjoyed it. All those that had
snubbed me or cut me down were now easy pickings for
me. But eventually, I realized that this gift was also
a curse.&#148;

&#147;A curse?&#148; Utena asked.

&#147;I talk to someone, and I don&#39;t know if what they say
is because they want to, or my will compelling them to
say what I want to hear,&#148; Juri said sadly. &#147;Even
Shiori, who I love, is swayed by the power of my will.
Only a vampire who is my equal will not fall under my
spell,&#148; she said, looking up to meet Utena&#39;s gaze.

&#147;Why not turn Shiori?&#148; Utena asked her gently.

&#147;Then she will be bound to me as her creator,&#148; Juri
said, &#147;and fall even deeper under my control.&#148; She
smiled, &#147;But you, you are special, Utena.&#148; Softly she
added, &#147;Of all of us, only you faced Akio&#39;s power and
prevailed.&#148;

Utena closed her eyes, and Wakaba&#39;s face appeared in
her mind. `That one time,&#39; she though, `I was hungry,
and nearly made her...&#39; She opened her eyes, noticing
Juri looking at her and quietly admitted, &#147;It&#39;s
happened to me, as well.&#148;

Juri reached over, gently taking Utena&#39;s hand. &#147;You&#39;re
the first woman to say no to me in months,&#148; she said
with a wry expression. &#147;To me, that&#39;s almost a great a
gift as if you&#39;d have said yes,&#148; she laughed softly.

&#147;You&#39;re very welcome,&#148; Utena smiled.

&#147;There&#39;s no one else here who could be your equal,&#148;
Juri said softly, &#147;and certainly no others who could
be mine.&#148; She reached out, gently brushing Utena&#39;s
cheek as she asked, &#147;Would you consider....&#148;

Utena reached up, cupping that cold hand between her
own. &#147;I can&#39;t promise anything,&#148; Utena said softly,
&#147;but after everything is over... maybe.&#148;

&#147;Thank you,&#148; Juri smiled up at her, and they both got
up from their seat. They took a few steps apart, when
Juri stopped and quietly said, &#147;I understand that
Wakaba, Anthy and others are looking for Kanae&#39;s
lair.&#148;

&#147;Yes?&#148; Utena asked.

&#147;I don&#39;t know where it is,&#148; Juri said softly, &#147;but I
wanted to warn you.&#148; She took a breath, &#147;Kanae may be
the most dangerous of us all, because she is
completely mad. She sees no value in human like, not
even as food.&#148;

&#147;I understand,&#148; Utena said softly.

&#147;Good,&#148; Juri answered, and slipped off into the night.

Lost in her thoughts Utena walked through the blessed
silence of the rose garden, tensing only when she saw
a figure lurking at the end of the trail. She took a
few steps forward, then relaxed a bit when she
realized it was Anthy.

Anthy stepped up to her, and gently slipped a white
rose into Utena&#39;s pocket. At her startled glance Anthy
simply explained, &#147;It looks good on you.&#148;

&#147;Thank you,&#148; Utena blinked, a bit thrown.

&#147;It&#39;s nothing,&#148; Anthy smiled. She walked beside Utena
for a bit before confessing, &#147;I heard what you said to
Wakaba back at the dorm.&#148;

&#147;I know,&#148; Utena answered. &#147;I saw you, hiding in the
shadows.&#148; She took a breath, more out of reflex than
any real need, &#147;I care for her, but not the way she
wants.&#148;

&#147;I&#39;m sorry,&#148; Anthy answered.

&#147;Feel sorry for her, not me,&#148; Utena sighed. She looked
up, her pink hair shining in the moonlight, &#147;Any luck
finding Kanae&#39;s lair?&#148;

&#147;A few more possibilities to check, come daylight,&#148;
Anthy answered. &#147;We&#39;ll find her, Utena, it&#39;s just a
matter of time,&#148; she reassured her.

&#147;I just hope that not too many will die in the
meantime,&#148; Utena sighed. &#147;There hasn&#39;t been any new
bodies found, and only two or three vamps tonight,&#148;
she reported, &#147;but it feels just like when a storm&#39;s
coming.&#148;

&#147;I hope you&#39;re wrong,&#148; Anthy said quietly

&lt;0o0o0o0o0o0o0&gt;

There was quiet in the kendo hall as the figure knelt
there in meditation, eyes closed yet all of her other
senses open to the world. Long black hair flowed down
her back, her white and red garb of a miko giving her
an odd aura. Then her eyes popped open and she reached
forward, picking up the katana from it&#39;s stand.

&#39;Touga, you bastard,&#39; Motoko Aoyama thought as she
swung, imagining a head severed in a splash of blood.
She moved gracefully through the forms of her training
and slowly banished her anger and rage, leaving only
distaste and a bit of guilt.

Sheathing the sword she heard a soft voice say,
&quot;You&#39;re very good.&quot; Looking up warily Motoko saw Kozue
Kaoru walking over to her, the lovely young woman
studying her with a thoughtful expression.

&quot;Not good enough,&quot; Motoko said to her dismissively,
&quot;or I would not have fallen under Kiryuu&#39;s control.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Kozue said softly.

Motoko stood there silently a moment, almost as if she
wasn&#39;t going to explain. &quot;A vampire&#39;s greatest power
is not his or her inhuman strength,&quot; she finally said,
&quot;but the power of their mind. By his will alone Touga
compelled us all, and only Utena&#39;s blood bond could
free us.&quot;

&quot;So now you&#39;re under Utena&#39;s control?&quot; Kozue asked
warily.

&quot;Possibly,&quot; Motoko conceded, &quot;but Utena has not
compelled us to act as Touga did.&quot; A pause as she
searched for words, &quot;Her power does not force us, in
fact at first she simply tried to send us away.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Kozue smiled, &quot;Utena isn&#39;t like Touga.&quot;

They walked out of the hall together, the swordswoman
and student. Motoko actually smiled faintly, &quot;No, not
at all like Touga.&quot;</pre>
