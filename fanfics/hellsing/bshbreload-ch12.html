<a href="../hellsing/bshbreload-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>&quot;I still think we should have asked some of Utena&#39;s
followers for help,&quot; Kozue said softly, the blue
haired girl following the others across the campus.

&quot;Most of them are trying to stay on Utena&#39;s sleep
schedule,&quot; Wakaba yawned unconsciously as the almost
unconsciously cheerful brown haired girl added,
&quot;besides, they may be more vulnerable if we encounter
a vampire.&quot;

&quot;Because they were enslaved by Touga,&quot; Anthy noted
thoughtfully, &quot;or maybe less, because they now serve
Utena.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Kozue nodded. She smiled wryly, &quot;And who gets
to tell Nanami that we sneaked off without her?&quot;

&quot;Not me,&quot; Wakaba quickly said as they reached their
objective.

They all stood hesitantly in front of the burnt shell
of the old science building, studying the wreck
dubiously. &#147;The fire did a lot of damage,&#148; Anthy noted
as she looked up at the blackened exterior, &#147;is there
even enough of the roof left to give a vampire
shelter?&#148;

&#147;There&#39;s always the basement,&#148; Wakaba said dryly. A
bit more crossly, &#147;Besides, we&#39;ve checked almost every
other abandoned building in Ohtori.&#148;

&#147;You&#39;re right,&#148; Anthy admitted. A bit more quietly she
said, &#147;I guess I just don&#39;t like the feel of this, is
all.&#148;

&#147;But,&#148; Wakaba looked in surprise at Anthy, &#147;you&#39;re a
vampire hunter.&#148;

&#147;That doesn&#39;t mean I still don&#39;t get nervous,&#148; Anthy
defended herself, &#147;or even a bit scared at times. It&#39;s
just that you get used to it.&#148;

&#147;I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way,&#148; Kozue admitted,
carefully pushing the door open. It didn&#39;t creak,
which struck both of them as odd.

&#147;Someone&#39;s oiled the hinge,&#148; Anthy murmured. She
pulled a stake from her clothing, her eyes narrowing
as she looked around cautiously.

&#147;Let&#39;s look around,&#148; Wakaba suggested.

&#147;We really should wait until tonight,&#148; Anthy quickly
answered, &#147;and then come back better prepared with
Utena.&#148;

&quot;It&#39;s daylight,&quot; Kozue frowned, &quot;if a vampire is here
shouldn&#39;t it be sleeping?&quot;

&quot;Not always,&quot; Anthy warned.

Wakaba didn&#39;t listen to her, venturing farther into
the building. A door was on the other side of the
room, and Wakaba tried the door knob. &#147;Hey, it&#39;s
unlocked,&#148; she smiled.

Wakaba turned the knob and pulled even as Anthy cried,
&#147;Don&#39;t!&#148;

Out of the pitch darkness of the other room a bone
white hand struck out, grabbing Wakaba firmly by the
throat. &#147;You.. shouldn&#39;t even be.. awake,&#148; a stunned
Wakaba managed to get out as the hand began to cut off
her air.

&quot;Wakaba!&quot; Kozue raced forward to help.

&#147;Not all vampires are the same,&#148; the woman&#39;s smooth
voice said even as the hand that was extended into the
sunlight began to smoke, the skin blistering. Wakaba
stopped her struggling, going limp in the grip of
unearthly strength. Kozue reached them and grabbed
desperately at that bone pale arm, but was unable to
budge it.

&#147;Let her go,&#148; Anthy hissed, stake ready.

&#147;You&#39;re not strong enough, little hunters,&#148; the woman
said, and Anthy could see other figures moving behind
the first vampire. With a wave of her still smoking
arm she sent Kozue flying, but Anthy didn&#39;t dare move
to check on her. &#147;I know you,&#148; the vampiress said,
&#147;you, Kozue and Wakaba. You all serve Tenjou Utena,
don&#39;t you?&#148;

Anthy would have said that she worked with Utena, but
this wasn&#39;t the time to debate. &#147;Yes, and?&#148; she asked.

&#147;Bring her to me,&#148; the vampire woman said, drawing the
unconscious Wakaba into the darkness, &#147;or her friend
dies.&#148;

The door closed, leaving only silence.




Utena awoke as the sunset came, her eyes opening to a
sight of gentle beauty. The young women lay close
around her, hands caressing her body, lingering as
they stroked at pale flesh. One girl kissed her neck,
another pressed her full breasts against her back, and
a third was draped across her leg. The girls and Utena
made a warm, comfortable jumble on the bed, each
taking comfort in the presence of the others.

&#147;Good evening,&#148; Utena smiled, and they began to rouse
themselves as well.

&#147;Do you need to feed, Utena-sama?&#148; a redhead asked her
with a sweet smile.

&#147;No, thank you,&#148; Utena smiled back, &#147;I just did last
night.&#148;

&#147;Darn,&#148; she chuckled, &#147;it&#39;s my turn next.&#148;

Utena laughed quietly. She pulled a uniform from her
dresser and began to dress. She felt their hungry
gazes upon her back and tried not to let her bother
her. Still, it stirred her hungers, not the hunger for
blood but for other pleasures.

She had never known the joy that another&#39;s smooth form
could grant, teasing and taming the raging hunger in
others until quite recently. Occasionally, she
wondered how it might feel to receive such pleasures,
but the feeding was enough for her. At least, that was
what she kept telling herself. A hammering at the door
jarred Utena from such thoughts, and she felt a tiny
bit or relief. A step, and she opened the door,
recognizing the heartbeats of those who waited.

`But why is it running so fast?&#39; Utena wondered,
moving to the door with a catlike grace.

Anthy&#39;s clothes were messy, her hair out of it&#39;s bun
and curling down her shoulders as she helped support a
bleeding Kozue. Wide eyed, she gasped, &#147;They&#39;ve got
her.&#148;

Utena felt a chill seize her, realizing that someone
hadn&#39;t been there to greet her when she awoke.
&#147;Wakaba?&#148; Utena whispered.

Anthy saw the pain in her eyes and had to look away.
&#147;Yes,&#148; she whispered.

&#147;How could you let this happen?&#148; Utena demanded
angrily, grabbing Anthy by the shoulders and shaking
her, one of her followers grabbing Kozue before the
badly dazed girl could fall to the ground. Her fangs
gleamed in the dim light, and the other girls began to
gather around, disturbed by their mistress&#39; rage.

&quot;Wsn&#39;t her flt,&quot; Kozue slurred weakly.

&#147;The vampire was awake during the day,&#148; Anthy
answered, trying to stay as calm as possible. She drew
the stake from her clothes, just in case.

Utena was clearly startled by that. &#147;But that isn&#39;t
possible,&#148; she said quietly, feeling a flash of shame
at her rage. She released Anthy, stepping away from
her in the hope of preventing such rough treatment
again.

&#147;Possible or no, it happened,&#148; Anthy answered. More
quietly, &#147;And she has other vampires in there with
her, but I&#39;m not sure how many.&#148;

&#147;Was it Kanae?&#148; Utena asked quietly.

&#147;I don&#39;t know for certain,&#148; Anthy answered, &#147;but her
arm was burned in the sunlight, and she didn&#39;t even
flinch.&#148;

&quot;Mistress, I&#39;ve stopped the bleeding,&quot; Hitomi said,
one of the other girls kneeling beside her as they
tended to the injured Kozue.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Utena closed her eyes, lost in her
thoughts a moment. &#147;Stay here, I&#39;ll be back soon,&#148; she
finally said quietly to the room at large.

&#147;But, what about Wakaba? We have to go after her as
soon as possible,&#148; Anthy softly protested, feeling
more than a bit guilty at leaving her with the
vampire.

&#147;Stay here!&#148; Utena barked, the command rolling across
them all like a wave.




Wakaba groaned softly, her entire body aching. She
unsteadily pushed herself up from the floor, the world
spinning wildly all around her. It was dark, pitch
blackness all around her, and she fought to try and
remember how she had gotten there.

&#147;Good evening, little one,&#148; the emotionless voice said
from nearby.

Wakaba felt her heart skip a beat in fear as the
memories began to slowly come back to her. `I know
that voice,&#39; she thought, turning her head to gaze up
at where the sound had come from.

The green haired woman sat comfortably, looking at her
much the way a cat might watch an particularly
interesting mouse. Her skin was bleached, as white as
the finest parchment except for a red scar on her arm,
and her eyes were pools of night.

Wakaba could almost feel herself falling into those
eyes, and had to look away to try to save her mind and
soul.

&#147;Well done,&#148; Kanae said with a tiny bit of amusement
in her voice, &#147;most people lack the wisdom to do
that.&#148;

She got up to stand at Wakaba&#39;s side, pulling her to
her feet in a single smooth motion. &#147;Oww!&#148; Wakaba
yelped as Kanae tugged too hard.

&#147;Did that hurt?&#148; Kanae asked her curiously. There was
no real feeling in the question, no trace of concern.
From her tone of voice it was like she was simply
asking about the weather, if it would be sunny or not.

Kanae let her go, and Wakaba barely managed to stay on
her feet. &#147;Yes,&#148; she hissed, reaching up to rub at her
sore shoulder.

&#147;I&#39;m sorry,&#148; the stone faced Kanae said. &#147;I&#39;m not
interested in hurting you,&#148; she said quietly, &#147;that
isn&#39;t the reason I&#39;m doing this at all.&#148;

Behind her Wakaba could make out shapes moving slowly
and she realized that there were vampires lining the
walls, watching them with eyes filled with nameless
longings. Wakaba looked at Kanae, her eyes wide. &#147;But
why...?&#148;

&#147;Do you know what it&#39;s like, to be a vampire?&#148; Kanae
asked her dully. &#147;We awaken each night, and the first
thought is blood. I rest, and all I see is the faces
of those that I have killed to survive. And my
Akio-sama...&#148;

&#147;I&#39;m sorry,&#148; Wakaba said softly. &#147;Uhg,&#148; she choked, a
hand moving with inhuman speed to clamp on her throat.

&#147;All you are is a bag of hot blood to me,&#148; a suddenly
feral Kanae hissed at her, &#147;so do not speak. Your very
life depends on it.&#148;

Wakaba nodded, silently, and Kanae let her go. Wakaba
fell backwards on her butt, and forcibly silenced her
cry of pain, biting down on her lower lip. &#39;She really
is insane,&#39; Wakaba thought, biting her lip till it
bled.

&#147;Akio-sama was made for me, made to be my eternal
companion, but he is gone,&#148; Kanae said softly. &#147;I
don&#39;t want to go on, but the vampire part of me is too
strong. It wants to live, whatever the cost,&#148; she
murmured.

Kanae closed her eyes fora moment, then opened them
wide to stare at Wakaba. &#39;Not again,&#39; Wakaba thought,
trying desperately to look away.

Casually Kanae looked away, ignoring the girl&#39;s sigh
of relief. &#147;None of the ones Akio created were strong
enough, all of them fell under my will,&#148; she said
softly. &#147;Please, let Utena be strong enough to resist,
to free me from this damned existence,&#148; much more
softly, so Wakaba could barely hear, &#147;free me from my
Mother&#39;s curse.&#148;




&quot;Oh Juri-sama,&quot; the little girl mewled softly in
pleasure, shuddering as Juri drank deeply. Her nightie
was thrust up to reveal wet thighs, her triangle of
golden hair soaked by expert caresses. She sighed
happily as Juri drew back fingers wet with her dew,
sliding free of the girl&#39;s shuddering body.

&quot;Rest, little one,&quot; Juri ordered as she straightened
her uniform, moving off into the night.

&quot;Yes m&#39;lady,&quot; she managed before falling into a deep,
dreamless sleep.

Walking away from the building Juri felt the
disturbance the new arrival made, but other than that
she barely registered on her other senses. `Utena is
really getting quite good at this,&#39; she though, even
as she said, &#147;Good evening, Utena.&#148;

The wind blew across the roof they were standing on,
the crescent moon rising slowly above them. &#147;I need
your help,&#148; Utena said simply, nose twitching as she
caught the scent of a sated female coming of Juri,
fighting back her disapproval.

Juri studied Utena, her lips curling up into a smile.
&#147;Help with what, I wonder?&#148; Juri asked teasingly, only
to be cut off by a soft snarl.

&#147;Don&#39;t play games with me, not now,&#148; Utena said
intensely. &#147;That crazy bitch has my best friend,&#148; she
finished coldly.

&#147;Wakaba?&#148; Juri asked, and Utena nodded grimly.

&#147;She has other vampires serving her,&#148; Utena said
softly, &#147;and I&#39;m going to need more than just Anthy&#39;s
help to stop her.&#148;

After studying her a moment Juri looked away from
Utena, softly answering her, &#147;No, it&#39;s not my fight.&#148;

Utena clenched her hands, distress radiating off her
as her thoughts raced. &#147;I&#39;ll make you a deal,&#148; Utena
said softly, &#147;I&#39;ll give you what you want, an equal.&#148;

&#147;Yes?&#148; Juri looked up, an intrigued expression on her
face.

&#147;I will transform Shiori into a vampire,&#148; Utena said
quietly, &#147;that way she&#39;ll be resistant to your
control, free to love you if she so wishes.&#148;

&#147;But she&#39;ll be under your control,&#148; Juri frowned.

Utena met Juri&#39;s eyes, &#147;If I change her, I&#39;ll leave
Ohtori soon afterward.&#148; She looked away sadly, &#147;I know
I can&#39;t stay here, a barely tame killer.&#148;

Juri met her eyes silently, weighing the truth of her
words. Finally, she nodded, &#147;All right, I&#39;ll help you
against Kanae.&#148;

They slid across the rooftops to Utena&#39;s dorm room,
seeing Anthy pacing the small room like some caged
lioness. Over on the bed Kozue slept, looking pale an
ill in the dim light. Anthy frowned as she saw Juri
follow Utena inside exclaiming, &#147;You?&#148; Anthy glared at
Utena and demanded, &#147;What is she doing here?&#148;

&#147;She&#39;s here to help,&#148; Utena answered crisply, not in
any mood to debate.

Juri smiled as she looked over at Anthy. Addressing
Utena she purred, &#147;She&#39;s quite attractive. Another
member of your loyal harem, maybe?&#148;

&#147;Loyal, yes,&#148; Anthy answered her coldly, &#147;but I am not
one of her harem.&#148; She looked over at Utena and asked
plaintively, &#147;Do we really need her?&#148;

Utena looked like she was getting a headache, &#147;Yes.&#148;
Crossly, she added, &#147;Let&#39;s go, please, before it&#39;s too
late to try and save Wakaba.&#148;

Juri nodded, &#147;You&#39;re right.&#148; She looked over at Anthy,
&#147;Truce?&#148;

Anthy still didn&#39;t look terribly pleased, but she
managed to say, &#147;A truce, for Utena&#39;s sake.&#148; She
paused, &quot;We have another problem, however.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Utena demanded irritably.

&quot;That would be me,&quot; Nanami answered, the blonde
emerging from the other room.</pre>
