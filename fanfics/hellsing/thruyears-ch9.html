&quot;...And as of this time,&quot; the news reporter&#39;s voice came over the 
television, &quot;there has been no word from the Chicago police or fire 
departments about injuries or deaths as a result of a ceiling which 
collapsed inside an old condemned warehouse in the early morning hours, 
although witnesses near the scene reported hearing a small explosion 
prior to the collapse. If there is any further word, we will be sure 
to...&quot;

(CLICK)

Goldie Muso switched-off the television, and then set down the remote in 
frustration. &quot;Are you certain you cannot get anything further?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mistress,&quot; one of her wards replied over the cellphone, &quot;but 
there&#39;s no way I can navigate around the police barricades. If you want, 
I can try to ask one of the officers about what happened.&quot;

Goldie sighed and shook her head. &quot;No, that could cause some undue 
attention to us. Look, don&#39;t worry yourself, just get back home. You&#39;ve 
done well.&quot;

&quot;Okay. I wish I could&#39;ve done more, Mistress.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve done better than expected. I&#39;ll see you soon,&quot; Goldie answered, 
then switched off the cellphone. Walking over to another girl, who was 
seated at a table working on a laptop, she asked, &quot;How about your end? 
Have you found anything?&quot;

The girl looked up fondly to Goldie and said, &quot;Well... I made a few 
discreet inquiries to the local hospitals and they haven&#39;t reported 
anything about Rally Vincent being admitted to any of them.&quot; Noticing 
the look of distress on the beautiful crimelord&#39;s face, she added, &quot;I 
also made inquiries to the local morgues. No one&#39;s been interred there, 
too. That has to be something, Mistress.&quot;

&quot;Yes, thank goodness for small favors,&quot; Goldie added. &quot;Look, continue 
looking into the hospitals and morgues, I want to know if Rally 
survived.&quot; She sighed in frustration and added, &quot;I should&#39;ve killed that 
engineer when I had the chance.&quot;

&quot;Well... he is a man, after all,&quot; the girl smirked.

Goldie smiled as well. &quot;Well... don&#39;t sell the male of the species too 
short, my dear. After all, they do have their uses... as little as they 
are. The human race, after all, wouldn&#39;t be possible without them.&quot; She 
gave the girl a small peck on the cheek and added, &quot;Listen, I&#39;m going to 
check in on our guest and see how she&#39;s doing. You continue to look into 
the matter... and while you&#39;re at it, look into the bank accounts, just 
in case we have to leave town.&quot;

&quot;Alright, Mistress,&quot; the girl chirped, continuing to work on her laptop. 
Goldie then exited the room and headed down the corridor of the mansion.

&#39;Minnie&#39; May Hopkins was in a foul mood. For the last few hours, she sat 
in a caged-off alcove of an elegantly-decorated room, forced to watch 
the news reports that had been broadcast during the day. It was bad 
enough that Goldie had kidnapped her just to lure Rally into a trap, but 
listening to how the trap the crimelord had set so go wrong had worried 
her greatly.

Of course... being forced to wear a skimpy red bunny costume didn&#39;t help 
the explosive expert&#39;s mood much. Why in the world Goldie would force 
her to wear that hideous thing was beyond her reasoning, nor was having 
to see her guard, a young girl, dosing herself with an intravenous 
injection of Kerasine.

The door to the room opened. Goldie entered the room and noticed the 
guard. &quot;Well dear,&quot; she began, &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re taking your medicine 
like a good girl.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that, Mistress,&quot; the girl said, smiling.

&quot;Why thank you. Now why don&#39;t you go to the kitchen and get our guest 
some dinner,&quot; Goldie glanced at May, who just rolled her eyes. Goldie 
simply smiled at her, &quot;I&#39;ll watch our guest while you do.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Mistress,&quot; the girl replied, setting her gun on the table 
and exiting.

As soon as the door closed, May decided to let Goldie have it. 
&quot;BER-OTHER,&quot; she snarled, staring daggers at her captor, &quot;Goldie, you&#39;ve 
got some gall to call that junk &#39;medicine&#39;!&quot;

&quot;What can I say?&quot; Goldie giggled as she shrugged her shoulders. &quot;It was, 
after all, for the girls own good that they take it. You can&#39;t imagine 
how miserable their lives were before I was able to liberate them from 
their families. Just look at them, May: they&#39;re happy, well-educated, 
and their lives fulfilled.&quot;

&quot;You mean to say you&#39;ve doped them up and forced them to kill their 
families to fulfill you sick fantasies!&quot; May countered. She looked again 
at the television and added, &quot;And you better make sure Rally wasn&#39;t hurt 
or killed because of this stunt you&#39;ve pulled!&quot;

Goldie looked at the television, and added, &quot;Oh I&#39;m certain Rally 
survived. My girls haven&#39;t gotten any information that she was admitted 
into any hospital, nor in any morgue. After all, she is destined to be 
by my side.&quot;

&quot;Oh brother,&quot; May groaned, rolling her eyes, &quot;you are SO deluded! And by 
the way, why did you have me wear this ugly thing? I mean, even when I 
was a high-priced hooker, I wouldn&#39;t wear anything THIS tacky!&quot;

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t know,&quot; Goldie muttered, smiling, &quot;I think you look cute.&quot;

&quot;You WOULD!&quot; May sighed.

Goldie just giggled as she walked to a covered mannequin, which she 
wheeled in front of May&#39;s cage. &quot;Plus, I had to make sure that you 
didn&#39;t have any hidden explosives on your person that you could have 
used to free yourself... and my girls did find quite a bit of them, you 
should be commended on how clever you hid them. And as we&#39;re on the 
subject of fashion, I wonder if you&#39;ll offer your critique on this 
charming little outfit I&#39;ve selected for Rally.&quot; She then uncovered the 
mannequin. What May saw nearly caused her to loose her lunch!

For what little was there, it was made of black leather and PVC. It 
consisted of what looked like a studded dog collar, a crossed harness 
and leather garter belt with PVC gloves and stockings, the highest heels 
ever - and with no panties or bra to speak of. &quot;OH... YUCK!!!&quot; May 
groaned, a sick look on her face, &quot;THAT HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST PIECE OF 
CRAP I&#39;VE EVER SEEN!!! I DON&#39;T THINK RALLY WOULD BE CAUGHT DEAD WEARING 
THAT THING!!!&quot;

&quot;Well... who cares what you think,&quot; Goldie smirked, covering it up. 
&quot;This is Rally&#39;s uniform of servitude to me.&quot; She had a dreamy look in 
her eyes as she added, &quot;She&#39;s going to be wearing this as my personal 
slave, whatever she likes it or not.&quot;

&quot;MISTRESS,&quot; the girl monitoring the laptop yelled, crashing through the 
door, &quot;SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE ACCOUNT IN GENEVA! IT... IT&#39;S 
GONE!!&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?!&quot; Goldie gasped, looking at the laptop that the ward set down on 
the nearest table.

Almost immedietly, Goldie and her ward tried to look into what was 
happening, with May looking on. After a few minutes, the ward looked up 
to her mistress and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... but I&#39;m afraid the money is... 
gone.&quot;

&quot;Now take it easy, this is no time to panic,&quot; Goldie reassured the girl, 
although May could tell that the crimelord was visibly shaken. &quot;Check 
the accounts in Antigua, Hong Kong and Singapore. Make sure they&#39;re 
still intact.&quot;

The girls made inquiries into the requested accounts, and with a relived 
sigh said, &quot;They&#39;re alright. The money&#39;s still there.&quot;

&quot;How odd about the Geneva account, though,&quot; Goldie muttered, scratching 
her chin. &quot;I only established that account very recently with the funds 
I got from the formula sale.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; May asked, overhearing.

&quot;Well... if you must know,&quot; Goldie began, turning around, &quot;about a month 
ago, I was contacted by an unknown party about their obtaining the 
Kerasine formula. It took a bit of personal debate on my part, but last 
week, I traveled oversees and greeted the person I spoke of. And after a 
small amount of negotiation, I licensed the Kerasine formula to him.&quot;

&quot;YOU WHAT!?!?&quot; May gasped, horrified at the prospect of Kerasine flooded 
on the open market.

&quot;Yes... in exchange for a considerable amount of money, I licensed a 
copy of the formula to this individual.&quot; Goldie then looked at her ward, 
who was frantically trying to recover said money and added, 
&quot;Unfortunately, those funds are now gone... and once I find the party 
responsible, I will make sure they&#39;ll suffer for it.&quot; However, Goldie 
soon found herself thinking, &#39;Although I suspect that the person I 
licensed the Kerasine formula may have had second thoughts about paying 
for it. He was a strange individual at that. I&#39;ve never seen someone 
that required eyeglasses with multiple lenses. And his hands... when I 
went to shake them to seal the deal... I can almost swear he had SIX 
fingers through those gloves.&#39; Wresting herself from those thoughts, 
Goldie went up to her ward and said, &quot;Nevermind about recovering that 
money. Just make sure our other accounts are secure. Then, have the 
guards take their posts outside... in case Rally shows up.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mistress,&quot; the girl said, logging-off and closing her laptop. &quot;But 
I still wonder who hacked into the Geneva account.&quot;

&quot;So do I, although I seriously doubt we&#39;ll ever find him,&quot; Goldie 
answered.

As the two continued to talk among themselves, May sat herself down on 
her rather comfortable bed. She then looked at her left hand, grateful 
they left her engagement ring, then whispered to herself, &quot;Where are 
you, Rally? I know you&#39;ve survived, you just have to. Please... come 
back and get me away from her.&quot;

GENEVA, SWISTERLAND, A FEW MINUTES PRIOR...

&quot;Please, I&#39;m begging you... don&#39;t make me do this,&quot; the injured banker 
pleaded to the individuals standing hover him.

&quot;Just do vhat you are told,&quot; Heinkel Wolfe replied in a low voice. 
&quot;Othevise... I vould hate to think vhat Yumie vould do to you next.&quot; She 
then pointed to her partner, crouched in front of the banker, a demented 
smile on the nun&#39;s face as she held the bloodied katana which she used 
to slice the banker&#39;s hamstring muscles on both his legs. Then pointing 
to the laptop she set in front of the banker, Heinkel added, &quot;Now... 
find the account requested.&quot;

Gulping visibly, the banker nervously complied. Quickly calling up the 
account, he displayed it for the two to see. &quot;Now,&quot; Heinkel said, &quot;I 
vant you to transfer all funds to this account, then close the 
previous.&quot;

Not wanting to have further harm inflicted upon his person, the banker 
completed the transaction. &quot;There,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#39;s completed.&quot;

&quot;Danke,&quot; Heinkel replied, picking up the laptop, &quot;You have done the 
church vonders. Come Yumie, ve must be off.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Bout time,&quot; Yumie said, stretching, &quot;I was getting tired of hearing 
this guy&#39;s sniveling.&quot; She pointed to the banker&#39;s direction and added, 
&quot;So what are we going to do about him?&quot;

&quot;Yes... you&#39;ve got to help me to a hospital. I... I won&#39;t tell 
anybody... I promise,&quot; the banker pleaded.

&quot;Oh I&#39;m certain you von&#39;t,&quot; Heinkel calmly replied as she affixed a 
silencer on her Desert Eagle.

&quot;W-W-W-WAIT!! YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO DO THIS!!! PLEASE HAVE MERCY!!!&quot; the 
banker pleaded, holding up his hands.

Heinkel just shook her head and replied, &quot;I must apologize, mein heir... 
but it is not in our nature to take mercy upon you. Only vne has that 
right... and ve&#39;ll pray that, if you are truly repentanent, then our 
lord vill have mercy on you.&quot; She then aimed the gun about two inches 
from his head.

&quot;NO... NOOOOO!!!&quot;

&quot;My lord, into thy arms we commend our poor brother to thy graces, 
Amen,&quot; Heinkel atoned, then pulled the trigger, sending a bullet into 
the banker&#39;s skull. After the deed was done, she turned to Yumie, who 
was cleaning her sword and added, &quot;I am surprised that I don&#39;t hear you 
complaining about being the vne to do the honors.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I did the pervert priest back in Chicago,&quot; Yumie began, sheathing 
her sword, &quot;so I think it was only fair you took care of the drug 
dealer&#39;s banker.&quot;

&quot;How very charitable of you, Yumie,&quot; Heinkel answered, walking away from 
the banker&#39;s body. &quot;Ve better report to Archbishop Maxwell, tell him the 
deed is done and return to the Vatican.&quot;

&quot;Yeah... he sounded a little concerned about the news coming out of 
Chicago,&quot; added Yumie. &quot;Kinda wished we stayed to help Father Anderson.&quot; 
That brought out a chuckle from Heinkel. &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot;

&quot;Yumie,&quot; Heinkel replied, &quot;I don&#39;t think that Father Anderson could 
handle both a couple vampires and you slashing everything in sight... 
not to mention both of us going before Archbishop Maxwell with him and 
trying to explain the damages.&quot;

&quot;You really should have fun more,&quot; grumbled Yumie.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, GOLDIE&#39;S HIDEAWAY MANSION, NIGHTFALL...

Other than the occasional stray cat stalking down the street, the area 
outside the otherwise nondescript building near Lakeview was otherwise 
quiet. Inside the building, one of the two sole males in the building 
looked somewhat bored. Still looking out the window, he looked over to 
his partner and said, &quot;How much longer do we have to watch the outside?&quot;

&quot;As long as the boss says so,&quot; the other thug said. &quot;Somehow, she&#39;s got 
the feeling that this Rally broad survived the collapse and wants 
everything ready when she arrives.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, whatever... just so long I don&#39;t have do drive down &#39;Boystown&#39; 
again,&quot; the first grumbled.

Just as he said that, a blue 1967 Ford Mustang Shelby Cobra GT-500 drove 
up to the building, the headlights dimming as it did. &quot;Hold on,&quot; the 
first one said, &quot;this might be it.&quot; Sure enough, Rally Vincent got out 
of the car and looked around.

&quot;Boss,&quot; the first one said over a radio headset, &quot;she&#39;s here. What shall 
we do?&quot;

&quot;Whatever you do, make sure she enters, do not accost her,&quot; Goldie&#39;s 
voice called out. &quot;Let me be the one who greets her.&quot;

Sure enough, Rally exited the car and looked around at her surroundings. 
She was dressed in the one outfit she knew May approved of when she 
bought it: tight blue denim pants with boots, a white turtleneck blouse 
and her favorite leather jacket. However, the one thing she wore that 
was unusual was the wrap-around sunglasses, even though it was clearly 
night. The hoods monitoring her arrival took note of it, but thought it 
was just an eccentricity she had and didn&#39;t get excited about it.

Rally then pulled out a scrap of paper from her pocket and looked at it. 
&quot;Well, this is the address Alfie gave me,&quot; she said, looking at the 
address of the building. &quot;Let&#39;s see if this is the right place.&quot; Drawing 
her CZ-75 from the shoulder holster under her jacket, she then made her 
way up the stoop to the door, found it unlocked and carefully made her 
way inside, gun aimed ahead of her.

&quot;Okay,&quot; The dark-haired woman remarked while quietly making her way 
around, &quot;if I were Goldie, where would hide May?&quot; Rally quickly made her 
way to the downstairs garage and was satisfied that she wasn&#39;t held 
there; there were just two cars and two garage doors, with a side door 
for pedestrian access. Rally quietly unlocked this door, then made her 
way back upstairs and checked the parlor, kitchen, dining room and 
storage areas. &quot;So it&#39;s upstairs I go,&quot; she said, then ascended the 
staircase to the second story.

Reaching the landing, Rally was confronted by a corridor filled with 
doors. Cautiously, she tested the first one... and found it unlocked. 
&quot;Hmmm... this could be promising,&quot; she mumbled, then slowly opened it, 
making sure to aim ahead of her. She peered inside the room, which was 
dimly lit, and found it to be exquisitely-decorated, almost resembling a 
drawing room. Creeping slowly inside, Rally quickly found something 
out-of-the-ordinary for this room: a barred-off alcove... and a familiar 
person sleeping on a bed inside of it. &quot;May... hey c&#39;mon May, wake up!&quot; 
she hissed, headed for the bars.

May, still dressed in her bunny outfit, sleepily raised her head upon 
hearing the voice. &quot;Umm... wassap... RALLY!!!&quot; she called out.

&quot;Shhhh,&quot; Rally whispered, holding her finger up to her lips. &quot;You okay, 
May? Goldie didn&#39;t do anything to you?&quot;

&quot;Other than dressing me in this awful thing,&quot; began May, also 
whispering, &quot;nothing much. Oh Rally, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re alright. I thought 
that collapse was the end of you.&quot;

&quot;Umm... yeah, about that,&quot; Rally said, almost hesitantly, &quot;we&#39;ll talk 
about that later. Look, do you know how to open these bars?&quot;

&quot;I wish I did, but I was out cold when I got here, not to mention Goldie 
took all my explosives and had her girls dress me up in this cheap 
outfit.&quot; May then noted Rally&#39;s glasses. &quot;Isn&#39;t it a little dark for you 
to wear those?&quot; she asked.

Rally looked a little uncomfortable before answering, &quot;It&#39;s alright... 
really it is. Now let me see what I can find.&quot; She then walked carefully 
around the cage and noted a panel on the wall in another alcove next to 
May&#39;s at a right angle. &quot;This looks promising,&quot; she said, going over to 
the panel. She bent over close, trying to figure out which switch 
operated the door. &quot;I think it&#39;s... this one.&quot; She then pressed a 
button... which caused the light to go bright, as well as another set of 
bars coming down in the alcove entrance, trapping Rally.

&quot;Well... that was expected. Why am I not surprised she&#39;d pull that?&quot; 
Rally muttered as she holstered her pistol, not sounding surprised about 
the bars.

The door on the side of the room opened, with Goldie and a number of her 
wards, each of them armed, exiting out of it. &quot;Well Rally,&quot; the 
crimelord began, walking up to Rally&#39;s cage, &quot;I thought you survived 
that fiasco yesterday. I&#39;m so relived that you finally came to your 
senses and decided to join me as my slave.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; replied Rally sarcastically. &quot;Okay Goldie, you got me. So 
why don&#39;t you be a good girl and let May go. She&#39;s no use to you now.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;d certainly love to,&quot; Goldie added, &quot;but I&#39;d like to keep your 
little friend as my guest for an extended period.&quot;

May didn&#39;t like the sound of that. &quot;Wha-what do you mean?&quot; she meekly 
asked.

&quot;What she means is that you&#39;re an insurance policy, May,&quot; Rally 
answered, looking around at her surroundings, &quot;just to make sure I don&#39;t 
attempt a break-out. Meanwhile, I suspect Goldie will try to dope you up 
so that she has an explosive expert to help her out in arranging 
bombings of either the cops or her rivals.&quot; May gulped, her eyes looking 
like a deer&#39;s in the headlights of a car.

&quot;Now that&#39;s a bit harsh, Rally,&quot; Goldie purred. &quot;I&#39;m certain we can 
arrange some sort of... arrangement that might put you at ease.&quot;

&quot;I bet,&quot; mumbled Rally, not believing a word of it. &quot;Look, now that 
you&#39;ve got me, there is one thing I like to know, Goldie... did you know 
you&#39;re selling Kerasine to people that use it to turn others into 
artificial vampires?&quot;

&quot;Is that what that awful Sir Hellsing been telling you, Rally?&quot; the 
crimelord teased. &quot;Now really, we all know that there&#39;s no such thing as 
vampires.&quot; Rally smirked at this comment as Goldie continued. &quot;As for 
the Kerasine, I&#39;ve recently sold the formula rights of another party who 
promises to improve on it.&quot; Goldie then rolled her eyes and added, 
&quot;Well... I did have the money, but somehow it disappeared and I&#39;m still 
trying to figure out who did it.&quot;

&quot;Well isn&#39;t that the breaks, Goldie,&quot; commented Rally, walking closer to 
the bar.

By this time, May had made it closer to the bars of her cell. She had a 
full view of Rally&#39;s confinement and noticed several things that were 
off about her friend. Rally seemed calm, considering her situation. One 
might say she was overly casual. She also noticed that Rally&#39;s dusky 
skin seemed paler than normal. May was beginning to wonder if her friend 
had suffered some serious injury in the collapse, which would take into 
account the pallor in Rally&#39;s skin and her attitude.

&quot;Still have that same spunk, Rally,&quot; Goldie smirked, walking closer to 
Rally&#39;s cell. &quot;Well... after your training, I think I can eliminate that 
annoying trait.&quot; She then reached her left hand through the bars to 
caress Rally&#39;s cheek. &quot;I am so looking forward to making you completely 
mine... my dear Rally.&quot;

However, when Goldie&#39;s hand touched Rally&#39;s cheek, an expression of 
horror came over her face and tried to draw it back. Then Rally grabbed 
Goldie&#39;s wrist with such speed it caught everyone in the room with 
surprise. Goldie&#39;s girls then drew upon Rally, but were waved back by 
their mistress with her free hand.

Watching this, May noticed a change in Rally&#39;s expression: she was 
looking at Goldie as if she was a cat who had just cornered a mouse... 
extremely predatory. &quot;What&#39;s the matter, Goldie?&quot; Rally smirked, &quot;I 
thought you wanted me. And I came all the way up here just to see you.&quot;

All that Goldie could do was to shake her head in disbelief. &quot;No... 
no... you can&#39;t be Rally,&quot; she managed to say, reaching for the pistol 
she had behind her. &quot;No one... could have skin that was... as cold as 
yours!&quot; Moving quickly, Goldie aimed the pistol point-blank at Rally&#39;s 
forehead - and fired!

&quot;NO, RALLY!!!&quot; May yelled in horror, seeing her friend shot... but then 
her mouth... and the mouths of Goldie&#39;s girls... nearly dropped to the 
floor seeing what&#39;s next.

Rally didn&#39;t let go, her right hand still in a firm grip with Goldie&#39;s 
left. She didn&#39;t even fall to the floor; she was simply bent over, 
shaking off what was supposed to be a fatal shot. In bending down, 
Rally&#39;s sunglasses had fallen off, broken from the pistol&#39;s effects.

&quot;That was a cheap shot, Goldie,&quot; Rally groaned after a few tense 
seconds. She then straightened up, pulling Goldie closer to the bars and 
snarled, &quot;What are you trying to do, piss me off?&quot;

May screamed in terror. Rally&#39;s eyes, which were normally a brilliant 
blue, were now blood red... the same color as Alucard and Seras! And the 
teeth that were barred in front of Goldie... the canines were enlarged! 
&quot;Oh my god... Rally!&quot; May called out, &quot;What... what in the world&#39;s 
happened to you?&quot;

Rally snapped out of her rage, clearly hearing May&#39;s distress. 
Trembling, she managed to catch a look at her friend, who was now 
obviously frightened. Rally could feel her insides tightening as she 
looked down almost in shame.

&quot;Rally?&quot; May managed to say, her fear giving way to curiosity. &quot;Are you 
alright? Did something happen at that warehouse?&quot;

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry, May,&quot; Rally began, finally looking up. &quot;This wasn&#39;t 
exactly the best way to break this to you. I was hoping to get you out 
of this first, then tell you.&quot; Turning her attention back to Goldie, she 
was able to get her anger in check before continuing with the crimelord. 
&quot;&#39;No such thing as vampires&#39;, eh Goldie? Well... you just happen to be 
looking at one... but not one of those cheap knock-offs you&#39;ve been 
helping to create with that Kerasine of yours. No... you&#39;re looking at 
the genuine article,&quot; Rally&#39;s face twisted into further anger, &quot;and I&#39;ve 
got you to thank for this! You know, that little bomb of yours was 
really brilliant, Goldie: knock me out and deliver me so that you can do 
what your perverted heart wanted! Only problem is the location you used 
to lure me to it: a warehouse that was due for demolition! Two things 
got in the way, though... namely Alfie&#39;s conscience bothering him. He 
tried to disarm that bomb but that little booby-trap you had really 
screwed-up the works! He hurt himself pulling me away when the bomb 
exploded and I had to save him when the first part of the ceiling fell 
down... but I ended up trapped when the rest of the ceiling came down on 
me...

FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE, 24 HOURS BEFORE...

A group of people were frantically trying to uncover Rally from a half a 
ton of fallen concrete and rebar from the destroyed second level. 
Detective Roy Coleman and Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing were 
doing all that they could do with the smaller pieces of debris. Seras 
Victoria, using her vampire strength, was having good luck with the 
larger piece. And even Alucard, who would normally not be involved in 
rescuing ANY human, was aiding, working side-by-side with the humans and 
his former fledgling.

Becky &#39;the Nose&#39; Farrah, still in shock hearing the news of Rally being 
buried, simply stood at the side, with Walter C. Dolnez still outside 
making sure Alfie was restrained. &quot;Please Rally,&quot; she pleaded, &quot;you&#39;ve 
got to be alive in there.&quot;

&quot;RALLY!!!&quot; Coleman called out, &quot;ARE YOU ALRIGHT!?!?&quot;

&quot;YES RALLY, ANSWER US, PLEASE!!!&quot; Sir Integra added as well, her suit 
getting torn and dirty working with the rough concrete.

For two minutes, the debris pile gradually diminished as the four worked 
feverishly. But then, Seras&#39; nose twitched. &quot;I... I smell blood,&quot; she 
gasped.

&quot;Yes, as well as I,&quot; the No-Life King added.

In almost a panic hearing this, Coleman redoubled his efforts, pulling 
chunks of concrete as he did. Then a groan was heard. &quot;THERE... SHE&#39;S 
THERE!!!&quot; he yelled, pointing to a large block of concrete.

&quot;ALUCARD, SERAS, GET THIS OFF OF HER!!!&quot; Sir Integra commanded, aiding 
the two vampires as well. Quickly but carefully, the three pulled the 
huge slab away.

Rally did not look well. Her right arm looked as if it was broken. She 
had cuts and wounds all over her body from rebar and concrete. And when 
the three rolled her on her back, she screamed in pain.

&quot;WALTER... GET IN HERE NOW!!!&quot; Sir Integra called out, then turned to 
Coleman and added, &quot;He&#39;s had medical training equal to your E.M.T. 
training! He should be able to assess her situation!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll call an ambulance!&quot; Coleman announced and started to run for the 
exit... only to be stopped by Alucard. &quot;What are you doing? We&#39;ve got to 
save her!&quot;

&quot;It will all in vain, human,&quot; Alucard said. &quot;She will be dead before 
they arrive.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; the detective snapped back as Walter 
arrived and began a cursory examination of Rally. &quot;She&#39;ll be dead if we 
don&#39;t get her out of here!&quot;

&quot;I am afraid Alucard is correct, Detective,&quot; the butler said, turning 
away from Rally. &quot;I am not a doctor, but I&#39;ve had enough battlefield 
experience to know that Miss Vincent has suffered serious internal 
injuries. If we do call the ambulance, there is a good chance that she 
would die before they arrive at the hospital, if not when they arrive 
here.&quot;

&quot;No... that can&#39;t be right,&quot; Coleman pleaded, not wishing to believe the 
dire diagnosis.

Sir Integra walked up to her butler, asking, &quot;Walter... is there any 
way...?&quot;

&quot;I am afraid not, Sir Integra,&quot; Walter answered, his voice with a note 
of sadness. &quot;The best we can do for her is to try to make her 
comfortable... until the end come.&quot; He then knelt at Rally&#39;s side, 
brushing the concrete dust off her bloodied face. Becky, also hearing 
this, fell to her knees in tears, with Seras trying to comfort her.

Suddenly, Rally attempted to stand up, only to cry out in pain doing so. 
&quot;Miss Vincent... you shouldn&#39;t try to move in your condition.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Rally,&quot; Sir Integra added. &quot;You only hurt yourself more.&quot;

But Rally wasn&#39;t listening. She continued to try to stand, only to fall 
back in pain doing so. &quot;M... May...&quot; she groaned, &quot;I&#39;ve... got... to 
save... May...&quot;

&quot;Rally... please don&#39;t worry... we&#39;ll get Goldie for you,&quot; Coleman said. 
&quot;I promise we&#39;ll make her pay for doing this to you.&quot;

&quot;That goes doubly for me, my friend,&quot; Sir Integra added. &quot;We will save 
May and bring Goldie to justice. Now you just lie there and...&quot;

&quot;NOOO!!!&quot; Rally yelled out, startling everyone. Gathering what little 
strength she had, she managed to say, &quot;Roy... Integra... Goldie wants 
me... nothing else. She... she&#39;s... libel to kill... May if I don&#39;t 
sh-sh-show up! Only I can... stop her... save May...&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re dying, Rally,&quot; Sir Integra pleaded. &quot;There&#39;s no way you can 
be able to do that.&quot;

A slight grin came from Rally&#39;s mouth. &quot;I... know of one... way... one 
way I can... save her.&quot; She painfully turned her head in the direction 
of the two vampires. &quot;One... way I know...&quot;

&quot;ARE YOU CRAZY, RALLY!?!?&quot; Coleman yelled, realizing what she had in 
mind. &quot;YOU CAN&#39;T POSSIBLY WANT TO BECOME A VAMPIRE TO DO IT!!!&quot;

&quot;AND I WILL NOT SAINCTION IT!&quot; Sir Integra added. &quot;RALLY, YOU DESERVE TO 
LIVE AND DIE AS A HUMAN!! LET LIEUTENANT COLEMAN DO THIS!! I CANNOT 
BELIEVE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY...&quot; But then felt Alucard&#39;s hand on her 
shoulder.

&quot;Master... it is not your place to say what Rally Vincent wishes,&quot; the 
red-clad vampire explained in an even tone.

&quot;AND JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?&quot; the Hellsing leader snapped back.

&quot;She has made her choice, my master,&quot; Alucard replied. &quot;Are you going to 
deny your childhood friend&#39;s last request because of your own pride?&quot; He 
then grinned and added, &quot;Let her join the darkness. I sense she can be a 
very powerful ally of all in this world!&quot;

&quot;Integra...&quot; Rally asked weakly, tears flowing from her eyes, 
&quot;...please...?&quot;

Never had the Hellsing leader had felt such uncertainty. For the better 
part of ten seconds, she wrestled with her soul about allowing yet 
another vampire to walk the earth... a vampire that was also her best 
friend. Sighing heavily, she conceded, &quot;Very well... I cannot refuse 
Rally. You may proceed, Alucard.&quot;

&quot;I would be happy to,&quot; the No-Life King began, &quot;IF it were my place to.&quot; 
He then looked at Seras, who was still with Becky.

&quot;Huh?&quot; the Draculina said, getting up. &quot;What are you talking about, 
Master?&quot;

&quot;Rally Vincent IS your chosen prey, Seras,&quot; Alucard answered. &quot;The honor 
should be yours.&quot;

&quot;You cannot be serious, Master?&quot; Seras replied, incredulous. &quot;You&#39;re not 
asking me to make Rally into a vampire?&quot;

&quot;No, I am not,&quot; Alucard said, then pointing to the dying Rally, he 
added, &quot;However, she IS. You better hurry... she doesn&#39;t have that much 
to live.&quot;

Seras looked down at Rally. The dying woman could only look up at her 
and weakly ask, &quot;Seras... please help me... save May.&quot;

For the longest five seconds she could think of, Seras sighed and 
answered, &quot;Yes Rally... I will.&quot; The young vampire knelt down and gently 
cradled Rally in her arms. &quot;Are you certain this is what you want to do, 
Rally? Do you really want to become a vampire?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Not really... but I... have to save... May...&quot; Rally&#39;s voice was almost 
a whisper. &quot;So Seras... please...?&quot;

Seras then gently planted a kiss on Rally&#39;s lips. &quot;Alright then.&quot; 
Steeling herself, she removed the bandage over Rally&#39;s earlier bite 
wounds, then bent down and bit Rally once again.

As Seras quickly fed upon Rally, the injured girl managed to place her 
unbroken arm to hug her. As she saw her vision slowly fade, Rally smiled 
as she felt her heartbeat slowing... and as it stopped, her left arm 
fell limply to her side.

Coleman held Becky during all this. When he saw Seras lift her head, he 
had to ask, &quot;Is... is Rally...?&quot;

&quot;Yes... she&#39;s dead,&quot; Seras answered, &quot;but I got to her in time.&quot; The 
Draculina took the time to close Rally&#39;s vacant eyes as she did.

All everyone could do was to watch.

END FLASHBACK

May&#39;s eyes were bright with tears as she heard Rally relate what 
happened. &quot;Rally,&quot; she breathed, &quot;it&#39;s... amazing. You did that... you 
sacrificed your humanity... just to save me?&quot;

&quot;I wish I didn&#39;t had to, May,&quot; Rally glumly answered. &quot;If it were 
possible... I wish I could&#39;ve stayed human and save you as one.&quot; Turning 
her attention back to Goldie, she coldly looked her in the eye and said, 
&quot;Well... I hope you&#39;re happy, Goldie. I died on that warehouse floor, 
but because I didn&#39;t want to leave May in your grubby hands, I chose 
this.&quot; Goldie turned her head, not wishing to look at those angry red 
eyes.

&quot;DAMMIT LOOK AT ME, GOLDIE!!!&quot; Rally yelled angrily, tightening her grip 
on Goldie&#39;s wrist, the crimelord wincing painfully as Rally&#39;s fingers 
dug into the skin. Reluctantly, Goldie found herself looking in a face 
that held mixed expressions of grief, hatred and anger. &quot;BECAUSE OF YOU, 
I CAN NO LONGER ENJOY A NICE SUNNY DAY, SEE THE CUBS AT A DAY GAME, OR 
EAT AT MY FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE!!! BECAUSE OF YOU, I MUST NOW SLEEP 
DURING THE DAYTIME AND DRINK BLOOD IN ORDER TO LIVE... BUT THAT LAST 
PART I DON&#39;T MIND... BECAUSE I AM SO LOOKING FORWARD TO DRINKING YOUR 
BLOOD, GOLDIE!!!&quot;

&quot;Girls,&quot; Goldie whimpered, &quot;I could use your help here!&quot;

Goldie&#39;s girls, who were originally aiming at Rally, soon turned their 
guns to their own heads. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; the lead girl called out, &quot;but 
could you let of our mistress and not hurt her... otherwise we&#39;ll have 
to pull our triggers... and I know you don&#39;t want it to happen.&quot;

&quot;Oh brother, not this ploy again?&quot; Rally grumbled, rolling her eyes. 
Then looking at the girls, her red eyes glowing, she added, &quot;Hey? You 
girls look a little tired. Why don&#39;t you take a nap?&quot; Immedietly, the 
girls&#39; eyes glazed-over, then collapsed altogether, all of them deeply 
asleep.

Seeing an opening, Goldie quickly hoisted her foot on the bars of 
Rally&#39;s cell and wrenched herself free from the dark-haired vampire&#39;s 
grasp and fall to the floor - but in the process breaking her wrist. 
Rally then kicked the door of her cell, breaking the lock and causing 
the door to swing away.

Goldie managed to pull herself up from the floor, but was having trouble 
standing on her feet. Rally exited the cell, staring intently at the 
fallen crimelord. Then her nose caught an unusual scent. Staring at her 
right hand, she happen to see that blood was staining her fingers - 
Goldie&#39;s blood. With a wicked gleam in her red eyes, Rally smiled as she 
licked the blood off her fingers. &quot;Mmmm... tasty. Goldie, if your blood 
tastes this good on my fingers, I just can&#39;t wait until I can get it 
from your veins,&quot; she purred.

Panicking, Goldie quickly gathered herself on her feet and fled the 
room, clutching her broken left wrist. &quot;Go ahead and run, Goldie,&quot; Rally 
called out, &quot;you&#39;re not getting away from me!&quot; She then went to May&#39;s 
cell, forced the door open... and was promptly surprised to see her 
friend rush at her with an enormous hut. &quot;Uh... May?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Alright Rally, I knew you wouldn&#39;t let me down!&quot; May cried, her face 
streaked with tears.

&quot;May... thank you,&quot; Rally said as she forced herself from May&#39;s embrace. 
&quot;I&#39;m really surprised. Aren&#39;t you scared just being this close to me?&quot;

May sniffled as she replied, &quot;Of course not, Rally... well... maybe at 
first. Look, I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a vampire now... you&#39;re my friend 
and that will never change, no matter what!&quot;

&quot;Well... that&#39;s nice to know,&quot; said Rally, smiling. &quot;Look, May, I gotta 
leave you. There&#39;s still Goldie to take care of.&quot;

&quot;Then take me with you, Rally,&quot; the blonde explosive expert pleaded. &quot;I 
think I can find my clothes in one of the other rooms...&quot;

&quot;No, May... you can&#39;t come with me!&quot;

&quot;But Rally...&quot;

&quot;May,&quot; Rally began, placing her hands on her friend&#39;s shoulders, &quot;just 
stay here and disarm these girls,&quot; she indicated the still-sleeping 
girls. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about Goldie... she&#39;s not getting away... and 
besides, what I&#39;m going to do to her... I really don&#39;t want you to see.&quot;

&quot;Then... you&#39;re really going to do it?&quot; May said. &quot;You&#39;re really going 
to kill Goldie... drink her blood?&quot;

Rally nodded. &quot;Roy and Integra are on their way here right now. I want 
you to promise me to stay here until they arrive and go with them... got 
it?&quot;

May thought for a while, then smiled a big smile and replied, &quot;Okay! Go 
get her, Rally!&quot;

&quot;I like your enthusiasm,&quot; Rally remarked as she took off for the door 
Goldie made her escape from and disappeared.

Gathering herself, May soon began taking the guns away from Goldie&#39;s 
girls, thinking to herself, &#39;Well, she may be a vampire now... but she&#39;s 
still the same Rally!&#39; However, a new, more unsettling thought came over 
the petite blonde, &#39;But... now that&#39;s she&#39;s a vampire, what going to 
happen to her in the future?&#39;

TO BE CONTINUED...

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES - Before I hear all the complaints and reviews... yeah I 
know: Hellsing canon only allows vampires of the opposite sex to make 
another vampire! However, there is a precedent I am following that 
allowed me to let Seras make Rally a vampire. A couple of months back, 
there was a story in that I liked &#39;Can You Hear the Darkness&#39; (that 
story is gone, BTW, I wonder what happened to it?). At the end of the 
story, if featured Seras with a female fledgling of her own, a young 
woman named Sara. I liked that, and it fit into the shoujo-ai/yuri 
dynamic that I am writing this fic series in.

As a matter of fact, I&#39;m thinking of making a new series of fics based 
on &quot;Through the Years&quot;. If you think it&#39;s a good idea, let me know about 
it. And while I&#39;m thinking about it... how about a tie-in story covering 
the 24 hours before Rally goes to rescue May, and the reactions and 
opinions of the people in Rally&#39;s life - or unlife, if I might say?

Also - I like to see all the reviews on THIS chapter!
