<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Reloaded (part 14 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../hellsing/bshbreload-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Anthy slept, her mind troubled by strange dreams and
visions. Her brother loomed over her, then Integra and
finally her comrade, blood leaking from her neck as
she begged Anthy for release. Finally she felt herself
returning to wakefulness, something that came as a bit
of a surprise to Anthy considering that she had
thought she was going to die. But why was her throat
so dry, a thirst filling her with such great need?

The door opened and Utena walked in, carrying a large
bowl in her hands. Whatever was in it smelled
wonderful, and saliva was soon filling up Anthy&#39;s
mouth as her stomach growled. &quot;What is that?&quot; she
managed to ask Utena, something making it difficult to
speak. She could feel her tongue brushing up against
something sharp at the front of her mouth.

&quot;Just think of it as chicken soup,&quot; Utena sat on the
bed beside her, the pink haired young woman holding
the bowl up to Anthy&#39;s mouth. There were soft slurping
noises as Anthy drank and Utena gently tipped it up
until it was empty.

Anthy felt much better as she finished up the bowl of
warm, salty soup, her eyes opening a crack to look
into the large bowl. The fluid remaining inside was
thick and red, and she recognized what it was almost
instantly. &quot;Blood,&quot; Anthy whispered, her eyes growing
wide with shock and horror. She tore herself free of
the covers, looking down at her pale form in shock and
horror as she leapt from the bed with inhuman speed.
&quot;What have you done to me?&quot; she cried out, glaring at
Utena.

&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything,&quot; Utena said to her quite
forcefully in reply. Much more softly, she added, &quot;I
asked Juri to do it.&quot; She looked at the bowl sadly as
she added, &quot;I made sure it was animal blood we fed
you.&quot;

&quot;So I won&#39;t have to feed on humans,&quot; Anthy murmured
softly. She swayed there, dazedly, then Utena caught
her before she fell over.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Utena asked her worriedly,
gazing into Anthy&#39;s eyes tenderly as she helped the
other woman lay back on the bed.

&quot;It almost feels like I can almost taste the air,&quot;
Anthy murmured to Utena breathlessly, &quot;I can hear the
heartbeats of everyone in the building.&quot; Her eyes got
wide as she said wonderingly, &quot;I never knew there
where so many shades of color.&quot;

&quot;Focus,&quot; Utena softly urged her. &quot;I know your new
senses can be overwhelming, so focus on something!&quot;
Utena grabbed her chin, making Anthy up look at her,
&quot;Focus on me. Listen to my words, what I&#39;m saying and
how I&#39;m saying it.&quot;

Anthy gazed at Utena, her eyes dilated and her breath
coming faster from a mixture of fear and excitement.
&quot;Why?&quot; she asked her softly, &quot;Why did you have her
change me?&quot;

Utena met her gaze honestly as she said, &quot;You&#39;ve
become too important to me.&quot; She sighed softly, &quot;I&#39;m
sorry, but I couldn&#39;t bear to loose you.&quot;

&quot;You... care about me?&quot; Anthy asked quietly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Utena admitted to her quietly. The pink
haired girl looked down, to avoid the piercing gaze
she was receiving. &quot;More than I realized,&quot; Utena said
softly.

Anthy took Utena by the chin, gently pushing so that
her eyes met hers once more. &quot;Me, too,&quot; Anthy
murmured, and gently pressed her lips to Utena&#39;s. The
last of the blood swirled between them as Anthy
sweetly drove her tongue into Utena&#39;s mouth, her nude
body pressing close to the still fully clothed Utena.

&quot;Anthy,&quot; Utena pulled back reluctantly, &quot;you&#39;re still
weak, we shouldn&#39;t....&quot;

Anthy looked up at her with eyes that blazed with
passion. &quot;Shut up,&quot; she said fiercely, &quot;you have no
idea how long I&#39;ve wanted this.&quot; She began to unbutton
Utena&#39;s top, &quot;Listening to you and your harem, I
thought I was going to rape poor Wakaba for a moment
there....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Utena said as she shrugged off her boy&#39;s
jacket, then the white shirt beneath it to reveal her
bare breasts.

Anthy leaned forward to kiss the pink tips of each
breast, her warm mouth heating the other vampire&#39;s
pale skin, bringing forth a soft moan. &quot;So beautiful,&quot;
she murmured, undoing a pants button even as she began
to suck.

Utena gasped, wiggling her hips a bit to help get her
pants down. &quot;Be careful with your teeth,&quot; she
shuddered as she kicked off her trousers, &quot;don&#39;t draw
blood.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be careful,&quot; Anthy promised as she reluctantly
abandoned Utena&#39;s breasts to kiss her way down the
other woman&#39;s belly.

&quot;You know,:&quot; Utena gasped as Anthy tenderly kissed
the front of her panties, &quot;I thought I was going to be
the one doing things like this to you....&quot;

Anthy looked up with a wicked little smile, &quot;Just
because I&#39;m feminine, doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t like being
in control.&quot;

Utena shuddered as Anthy drew the panties aside to
reveal her wetness as she said, &quot;I stand, or in this
case lay, corrected.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll have your chance later,&quot; Anthy winked as she
stroked Utena&#39;s pulsing flesh with her fingers, then
kissed her wetness happily.

Arisugawa Juri watched with some concern as Utena
carefully bit into Shiori&#39;s neck, sending the girl
swooning in her arms. With a surprising ruthlessness
she drained the girl near to death, then pressed her
own bleeding wrist to Shiori&#39;s mouth.

Like a dying man in a desert Shiori latched on,
sucking down the mix of her own blood and Utena&#39;s,
drinking the altered fluid down. Slowly she tired,
wilting in Utena&#39;s arms, then she finally slipped into
unconsciousness.

&quot;Is she going to be all right?&quot; Juri asked as Utena
lay Shiori down on the bed.

Utena looked tired, her smile weary as she said, &quot;I
hope so. Akio turned me like that, and it worked with
you and Anthy too.&quot;

Juri walked over to Utena&#39;s side, the tall, orange
haired woman offering her arm for support. &quot;We&#39;d
better let her sleep,&quot; she said as the two of them
left the bedroom.

Ruka met them outside, the blue haired young man
nodding to the two vampires respectfully. &quot;Is it done,
m&#39;lady?&quot; he asked quietly.

&quot;It&#39;s started, anyway,&quot; Utena answered dryly.

&quot;Get Utena a packet of blood,&quot; Juri ordered briskly,
&quot;since I doubt she&#39;d appreciate you bringing a
volunteer home.&quot;

Ruka&#39;s lips twitched up in a smile, &quot;Of course,
ma&#39;am.&quot;

Utena took a seat without asking, her pink hair
flowing around her face. &quot;I can never tell if you&#39;re
joking or being sarcastic,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;A bit of both,&quot; Juri admitted as she sat down
nearby. She studied Utena a moment, then asked, &quot;Have
you decided what you&#39;re going to do?&quot;

&quot;I promised I&#39;d go,&quot; Utena noted, faintly surprised.

&quot;Maybe so,&quot; Juri agreed, &quot;but I was the one who asked
you to.&quot; She rose, stretching like a cat as she
conceded, &quot;I think I&#39;ve changed my mind.&quot;

Utena watched her, gulping a little as the sensual
beauty of Juri&#39;s tall, well built form washed over
her. &quot;And why is that?&quot; she managed to ask, her throat
feeling oddly tight.

Juri smiled as she advanced on Utena&#39;s chair, her
eyes sparkling with barely repressed desire. &quot;I want
you,&quot; she purred, &quot;almost as much as my dear Shiori.&quot;
She reached out to stroke Utena&#39;s cheek, &quot;Maybe more
so, since it would be a joining of equals.&quot;

&quot;This is not a good idea,&quot; Utena stammered, &quot;we&#39;re
both still coming down from a battle, it&#39;s clearly
affecting our thinking....&quot;

&quot;Utena?&quot; Juri asked.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Utena answered nervously.

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Juri said firmly as she bent down to kiss
her lingeringly.

Ruka entered the room, then stopped with a smile on
his face as he saw them kissing. &quot;Ahem,&quot; he cleared
his throat loudly.

&quot;Ruka, your timing stinks,&quot; Juri pulled back
reluctantly.

&quot;Sorry, m&#39;lady,&quot; Ruka answered wryly, delivering the
warmed packet of blood for Utena.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Utena said, a slight blush to her
cheeks.

Juri gave her a wicked grin, &quot;Maybe we can share....&quot;

&#39;I am in so much trouble....&#39; Utena thought weakly as
Juri advanced on her again. &quot;If I say I&#39;ll stay, would
you stop?&quot; she asked with a half smile.

&quot;No,&quot; Juri bent forward to lick her cheek, &quot;but I&#39;m
glad to hear it.&quot;

End

Omake!

&quot;What&#39;s with everyone?&quot; Utena wondered as she tiredly
staggered back to her rooms, &quot;First Anthy jumped me,
then Juri, I&#39;m exhausted.&quot;

&quot;Utena-sama!&quot; she heard in musical tones.

&#39;Oh no,&#39; Utena spun around to see the former thralls
of Touga chasing after her, all dressed in some of the
frilliest lingerie she had ever seen. &quot;Ah, ladies, how
can I help you?&quot; she asked, hoping it wasn&#39;t what she
thought.

&quot;We love you!&quot; the blue haired Ami Mizuno cried,
trying to pounce on her.

Utena gracefully dodged, then another grabbed her by
the waist. &quot;Love us, Utena-sama,&quot; the swords woman
called Motoko cried out.

Struggling free Utena ran right into a set of bouncy
breasts. &quot;Oooh, Utena,&quot; Mai Tokhia purred, &quot;you like
me?&quot;

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Utena slipped free with a blush.

&quot;Over here!&quot; Wakaba yelled from a open door, the
brown haired girl waving wildly.

&#39;Thank goodness,&#39; Utena thought as she leapt over
another girl then sprinted for the door. Wakaba
slammed it shut behind her as Utena entered, then
Utena sighed, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Utena?&quot; Wakaba looked at her seriously.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Utena looked over to meet her eyes.

Wakaba used both hands to tear open her shirt, &quot;Take
me!&quot;

&#39;Out of the frying pan, into the fire,&#39; Utena
mentally groaned as Wakaba leapt on her.

End

Notes: Sorry for the LONG wait for updates. I had
originally considered following the road trip model of
the first version of this series, but I find I like
the idea of Utena and friends living in a love nest at
Ohtori. *lol*</pre>
