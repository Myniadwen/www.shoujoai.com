<h1>Welcome to the Dollhouse</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ppain.html">Princess of Pain</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;I didn&#39;t know you wanted a girlfriend.&quot;

Ugh.  Him.

I light my cigar and squeeze the match out between thumb and 
forefinger.  I take a nice, long drag and enjoy the thick taste of it, 
the burn in my lungs.  I can&#39;t recall a time when I&#39;ve actually 
finished an entire cigar, but I enjoy smoking.  The act of 
contributing to my own death helps me to feel alive.

I blow smoke out my nose.  Ah, I can feel my nasal tissue turning 
black. Good.

When I feel like it, I glance over at him.  He stepped through the 
wall.  He&#39;s standing next to the portrait of my father, sans hat and 
glasses, examining me with slitted red eyes.  And that smile.  That 
fucking smile of his.  I own his life; I&#39;ve got him by the old 
gemstones, so why the fuck does it always seem like HE&#39;S the one 
playing a joke on ME?

&quot;Forgive my presumption, Alucard.&quot;  Another drag.  More burning.  More 
*sensation*.  &quot;When I made that statement, I had no idea that you had 
it in for my butler.&quot;

&quot;Ah-ah-ah, Integral.  There was nothing between Walter and I when 
Celas first joined our happy little slave ring.&quot;

&quot;Then exactly when did this occur?&quot;  I am a little curious.  Walter 
never struck me as being the nancy type.

An expansive shrug.  &quot;Have I asked how you came to be entangled with 
my child?&quot;

I try to stub out my cigar in the ashtray.  I hit the desk instead, 
leaving a loose scrawl of ash on the polished dark surface.  Damn.  He 
had to be watching when I did that, didn&#39;t he?

&quot;I... was trying to discipline her.&quot;

One black eyebrow raises in inquiry.

Why the hell am I telling him this?  Him, of all the snakes that 
creepeth on the earth and feed off the clay heels of humans?  I should 
keep a journal to vent in.  Maybe then this wouldn&#39;t be.

&quot;Always acting irresponsibly.  Little twit.  Always trying to get 
herself killed.  Never drinking the blood we give her--you could try 
to train her better, Alucard--&quot;

The slightest flinch.  Good.  One for me.

&quot;--but that&#39;s just part of it.  She&#39;s so... weak.  She can be strong, 
but only when she has someone to prop herself against.  She can&#39;t 
stand on her own.  She&#39;s a puppet.&quot;

&quot;So you decided to stick your hand in her and make her dance?&quot;

Oh, if only looks could kill.  I would trade away all of Hellsing for 
the eyes of a basilisk.  I would set up my newly-stone Alucard on my 
balcony and watch as pigeons shit on his amused, presumptuous face.

&quot;And you?&quot; I grit through tense teeth.

&quot;Oh, it was sheer chance, really,&quot; he says, his voice as light as air.  
&quot;I&#39;ve always liked him--he&#39;s far more intelligent and skilled than the 
rest of you bumbling humans put together.  He&#39;s very... what&#39;s the 
word... well-preserved.&quot;

&quot;Cradle-robber.&quot;

He laughs.  Damn it.  Damn him!  &quot;Were we in public, the passers-by 
would mistake him for my father.&quot;

&quot;You flatter yourself, Alucard.  Not only are you nowhere near as 
handsome as Walter, young or old, I highly doubt that he would be 
foolish enough to want to be seen with you in public.&quot;

For an instant, the perpetual smile is gone, replaced by an angry 
neutrality that would have rendered the bowels of a weaker person to 
water.  Even so, my knees tremble a bit.  Then the storm passes and 
the smile returns.

&quot;Integral, my dove... you forget.  I am not you.  Never mistake your 
loneliness for mine.&quot;  The smile widens.  &quot;In that, we are a bit 
alike, aren&#39;t we?  Both seeking ways to while away the time and forget 
that we are dead?&quot;

&quot;There is only one corpse in this room.  And I doubt Walter would 
appreciate being referred to as a hobby.&quot;

He laughs again.  Goddamn it.  &quot;Well, you certainly lurch about like a 
corpse made living.  A loopy, maybe, or one of those charming Nazis 
brought back to life.  And I don&#39;t think Celas would like to hear you 
describe her as a marionette.&quot;

&quot;Is there a point to this?&quot; I snap.

His pale face becomes grave--the smile shrinks down to the slightest 
curve of his lips.  &quot;Only this.  I care for, and care about, your pet 
Shinigami--as much as a &#39;soulless monster&#39; like me can care about a 
human.  I will continue to do so.  There&#39;s no cause for concern on 
your part.  But you...&quot; his voice lowers to a threat &quot;...had better 
care for and about my child.  Celas is not Einstein, but she&#39;s not 
stupid.  More important than her brains, she is kind.  If you feel the 
need to play with her, don&#39;t hurt her.  If you return her to me 
damaged in any fashion, I swear to you... I will first damage this 
seal.  Then I will damage you.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Master.&quot;

The smile widens to his customary Cheshire grin.  &quot;I thought you might 
listen to reason, Integral.  It&#39;s such a rare quality.  I admire you 
for it.  Good night.&quot;

And he fades through the portrait of my father with a flux of sound.

I fumble through my drawers.  Where did I put those stupid cigars?  
After closing the last one and giving up, I notice that I left the box 
on the surface of the desk.  Smooth on, Integral.  If only--

A head of dark hair suddenly peeks through my father&#39;s portrait.  The 
kind, oil-rendered eyes are replaced by twin garnets flawed with onyx.  
They twinkle at my gleefully.

&quot;By the by, Sir Hellsing... wouldn&#39;t Walter make the most wonderful 
nosferatu?&quot;

Unfortunately, he dissipates before I can get my shoe off and throw it 
at him.  Cheeky bastard.

I light another cigar and watch it burn between my fingers, 
occasionally breathing in the burning black that puffs into my face.

I fucking hate vampires.
