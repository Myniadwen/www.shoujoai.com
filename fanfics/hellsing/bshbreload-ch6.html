<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Reloaded (part 6 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../hellsing/bshbreload-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The shower pounded down on the slim young woman, her blonde hair soaked 
as she scrubbed frantically on her body. Nanami Kiryuu was tired, almost 
exhausted after the hectic events of the evening but she simply refused 
to leave the shower until she was clean.
 
&#39;I still can&#39;t believe it,&#39; Nanami thought dully.
 
She closed her eyes, a flash of memory appearing in Nanami&#39;s mind. Poor 
Tsuwabuki, the brown haired boy she had once known, now reshaped into a 
shambling parody of himself. The vampire boy had tried to stalk her, 
pinning her into a corner to attack her.
 
&quot;Then she came,&quot; Nanami rested her head against the clean tile of the 
shower, the powerful streams of hot water soothing her aches and pains.
 
Looking like some unearthly warrior Tenjou Utena had simply skewered 
Tsuwabuki, hammering the struggling creature to the ground even as she 
delivered the killing stroke. Looking up, her blue eyes were gently 
compassionate even as she harshly instructed her.
 
With a shaking hand Nanami reached out to turn off the driving water, 
pushing the curtain aside and stepping out to grab a fluffy tower to dry 
herself off. Pulling a warm wool robe on she made her way into her 
bedroom, eyes dark as she seriously considered things that she had heard 
and seen over the past few weeks.
 
&#39;Vampires in Ohtori,&#39; Nanami thought bleakly. It would have sounded like 
a bad novel only a short time ago, but with the evidence of her own eyes 
she had to believe it. Besides which, it explained allot... the 
disappearance of her brother and most of the student council, Akio&#39;s odd 
behavior, and many more events.
 
Firmly Nanami kept her thoughts away from her older brother, Touga, who 
had disappeared along with all the others. She had only seen him once 
since then, late at night standing out on the balcony of her room. His 
long red hair had blown in the breeze, her expression strangely haunted 
as he looked out at the stars.
 
&quot;Nanami,&quot; he had turned to look at her, an odd expression of longing on 
Touga&#39;s face.
 
&quot;Big brother,&quot; she looked at him in surprise, hesitantly stepping 
forward.
 
&quot;Stay there,&quot; Touga ordered her harshly, his red eyes flashing. Gentling 
his voice he continued, &quot;Forget about me, Nanami. The daylight is your 
only protection.&quot;
 
With those mysterious words he was gone, disappearing into the night and 
leaving a very confused Nanami in his wake. Now, of course, she had a 
very good idea what was going on, but what do about it remained a 
mystery.
 
With a weary sigh she climbed into bed, Nanami pulling the covers up 
around her. &#39;I need to see Miki,&#39; she thought wearily even as she could 
feel herself dozing off, &#39;he&#39;s the last councilor around and might know 
more about this than he&#39;s telling.&#39;
 
The sun rose over Ohtori and Nanami found herself out and about, feeling 
not much the worse for wear for her night&#39;s adventures. Dressed in her 
school uniform she leisurely made her way to classes only to be drawn to 
a crowd gathered near the gardens.
 
Sprawled out in one of the gardens the girl&#39;s nude body was pale, 
seemingly drained of all it&#39;s blood, and many wounds that looked like 
they were made by a blade marked her arms. Most of them seemed long 
healed, but one still oozed a bit of pink.
 
Kneeling beside the body and examining a note that had been left nearby 
was Himemiya Anthy, the strange young woman who had helped her get home 
in the aftermath of the vampire attack last night. Nanami met her gaze 
calmly, then she turned away, knowing that there was nothing more that 
she could do there.
 
&#39;Is that how I could have turned out?&#39; Nanami wondered, entering into 
the administration buildings at Ohtori academy.
 
The student council at Ohtori, sometime before Akio came, had met out on 
a well lit, sunny balcony overlooking the grounds of the academy. Almost 
as soon as he arrived their new acting dean had abolished that practice 
and set up a council room inside, a more standard meeting room with a 
long straight table and chairs. It was here that, in the mornings, Miki 
attended to the remaining duties of the much reduced student council.
 
&quot;Nanami-san,&quot; Miki looked up with a tired smile as she entered, the blue 
haired boy&#39;s eyes shadowed with tiredness.
 
&quot;You need to recruit some temporary council members,&quot; Nanami pointed out 
as she walked over to where he was sitting, &quot;you can&#39;t keep handling 
this yourself, Miki-kun.&quot;
 
Miki shook his head tiredly, &quot;There&#39;s another election coming soon 
enough, I just don&#39;t want the replacement council to have a mess to deal 
with when I&#39;m gone.&quot;
 
&quot;There&#39;s enough of a mess right now,&quot; Nanami answered. He looked up from 
the paperwork as she quietly said, &quot;I saw Tsuwabuki last night, and 
Tenjou Utena.&quot;
 
Miki froze at the mention of the name. &quot;That&#39;s impossible,&quot; he lied 
badly, &quot;Utena disappeared from the school a while ago.&quot;
 
&quot;I saw them,&quot; Nanami repeated, &quot;along with my brother, Touga.&quot;
 
&quot;You know, then,&quot; Miki&#39;s voice was harsh, painful.
 
&quot;Not everything,&quot; Nanami answered.
 
Miki sighed, putting his face into his hands. &quot;It&#39;ll almost be a relief 
to ask about it,&quot; he murmured. He got up, stiffly, then walked over to 
look out one of the windows, sunlight streaming inside to warm the two 
of them.
 
&quot;It started shortly after Akio Ohtori arrived here, after marrying Kanae 
Ohtori. One by one he had private conferences with the Student council 
members,&quot; Miki said grimly, &quot;and afterward they shared his nocturnal 
habits. I think the only reason I was spared is because he needed 
someone who could function in the daylight.&quot;
 
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell anyone?&quot; Nanami looked at him with a mixture of 
pity and anger, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you try to stop them?&quot;
 
&quot;I tried,&quot; Miki&#39;s shoulders shook, &quot;but I couldn&#39;t resist Ohtori. A look 
and you found yourself obeying him, if you wanted to or not.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Nanami sighed, reaching out to put a hand on his shoulder. 
They stood there silently a moment, &quot;Is Akio gone?&quot;
 
&quot;Dead, yes,&quot; Miki sounded relieved as he turned to meet her eyes, his 
own glistening with tears. &quot;Somehow Utena resisted him, killed him with 
one of the wooden practice swords.&quot;
 
&quot;And the other council members?&quot; Nanami quietly asked.
 
&quot;Touga, Saionji and Juri are still out there,&quot; Miki said grimly, &quot;along 
with any of the others that Akio changed.&quot; He sighed, &quot;Juri isn&#39;t 
killing anyone, as far as I know, but Touga.....&quot;
 
Nanami wanted to speak up, defend her brother, but there had been 
something she saw in Touga&#39;s eyes that prevented that. &quot;And Saionji?&quot; 
she asked.
 
&quot;His mind is broken,&quot; Miki revealed, &quot;something that happened to him 
when he was changed.&quot; His expression went grim, &quot;Akio liked to.... play 
with people, male or female, and that may have contributed.&quot;
 
&quot;He raped them?&quot; Nanami sounded ill.
 
Miki just nodded, and there was something in his expression that told 
Nanami not to pursue that line of questions any more. In all honesty, 
Nanami wasn&#39;t sure she really wanted to know. &quot;With him gone the 
vampires are leaderless,&quot; he added.
 
&quot;But still dangerous,&quot; Nanami sighed. She looked over at him curiously 
to ask, &quot;And who is this Himemiya Anthy? She looks like Akio....&quot;
 
&quot;She says she&#39;s his sister,&quot; Miki responded, &quot;come here to try and stop 
him.&quot;
 
&quot;Must have been a shock to find him already dead,&quot; Nanami mused.
 
&quot;Considering I had to be the one to tell her,&quot; Miki agreed. He 
brightened a bit, &quot;She seems intent on cleaning up the mess that Akio 
left behind.&quot;
 
&quot;All alone?&quot; Nanami raised her eyebrows.
 
&quot;She does have Utena&#39;s help,&quot; Miki pointed out.
 
Nanami felt an odd emotion, one that she couldn&#39;t name rising to the 
surface of her soul. &quot;Miki,&quot; she leaned forward intently, &quot;tell me about 
Tenjou Utena.&quot;</pre>
