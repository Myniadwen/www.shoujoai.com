AN ENGLISH COUNTRY ROAD, EARLY EVENING...

The road near London was dark, fairly deserted and clear of traffic &#150; 
which was perfect for the car &#150; a blue 1967 Ford Mustang Shelby Cobra 
GT-500 &#150; as it powered down it. Inside, Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent and Seras 
Victoria sat, with Rally driving and Seras studying a map in the 
darkness. Ordinarily, one would use a flashlight to read such a thing 
without the dome light on, but when you are two vampires, like the two 
women inside, then it can be done in the dark.

Rally had wore her usual leather jacket, jeans, boots and white 
turtleneck. But her master was not wearing her uniform, instead wearing 
low-cut denim jeans, matching leather dog-collar necklace and bracelets, 
and a bare-midriff black top with spaghetti straps that showed-off her 
impressive bustline. Rally would occasionally glance over and smile, 
marveling at the seductive beauty of her master Seras, but would soon 
find herself concentrating on her driving again. &quot;So,&quot; she finally said, 
&quot;how long before we reach the target area?&quot;

Seras studied the map again, then looked at her darkened surroundings. 
&quot;Not for another twelve-or-so kilometers I would guess,&quot; she answered. 
The Draculina glanced over to her fledgling and added, &quot;Feeling a little 
distracted, Rally?&quot;

&quot;Other than that sexy outfit you&#39;re wearing, not much, Master,&quot; the 
dusky-skinned vampire quipped. &quot;Still, I&#39;ve got an odd feeling about 
this mission.&quot; Rally paused before continuing, &quot;Pip may be an idiot and 
a pervert, but he&#39;s also a top-class soldier. To see him and a couple of 
the Wild Geese get clobbered the way they did...&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Seras put in. &quot;It&#39;s all so... odd.&quot; Her thoughts, as well as 
Rally&#39;s, trailed back to the previous night...

TWENTY-FOUR HOURS PREVIOUS, THE HELLSING MANSION...

Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing strode at a brisk pace towards 
the mansion&#39;s medical dispensary, where she was greeted by Rally and 
Seras, who were also walking at the same pace. &quot;We got the message from 
Alucard,&quot; Rally began. &quot;Do you know what the hell happened?&quot;

&quot;More than likely that Pip had botched the intelligence mission I sent 
him and a couple of his men on this morning,&quot; the Hellsing leader 
snarled, grinding on the tip of her cigar. &quot;Damn it all, it was only 
supposed to be a simple information gathering mission. How in the name 
of God did he get into this mess?&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about, Sir Integra?&quot; the Draculina, dressed in her 
usual yellow miniskirt uniform, asked.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you ask Captain Bernadotte yourself when we get there,&quot; was 
all Sir Integra said as she opened the double doors of the dispensary, 
followed by Rally and Seras. What the two vampires saw caused their jaws 
to drop.

Two of the Wild Geese were lying on cots, showing obvious signs of a 
severe battering &#150; bruises and contusions were all over their bodies, 
while Walter C. Dolnez was currently bandaging Pip Bernadotte, who was 
in an equal condition. Off to the side, Alucard was leaning with his 
back against the wall, a big, evil smile on his face. &quot;Well, nice of you 
to drop by, Sir Integra,&quot; the No-Life King began. &quot;And to think that 
tonight was going to be a boring night.&quot;

&quot;Later, Alucard. I am in no mood for your shenanigans right now,&quot; Sir 
Integra growled. Standing in front of the somewhat-beaten Pip, she 
glowered at him and said in a low voice, &quot;What in the world happened 
here? And do not try to beat around the bush, for I am thoroughly angry 
right now!&quot;

&quot;Honest, Mon commander,&quot; the one-eyed Frenchman began, sounding a bit 
contrite, &quot;we tried to get in but it was no use! Zat girl &#150; zat HORRIBLE 
girl told us &#39;No men allowed&#39;!&quot;

&quot;Well did you even TRY to find an alternate means of an entrance, 
CAPTAIN?&quot; the Hellsing leader continued, her voice gaining a further 
edge.

&quot;Zat was ze FIRST THING we did!&quot; Pip pleaded, &quot;but somehow, all ze doors 
wouldn&#39;t open &#150; even when we tried to force zem open! The windows 
wouldn&#39;t break either, don&#39;t ask me how! So we had to into ze front door 
&#150; and zat&#39;s when we ran into &#150; her!&quot;

&quot;My, my... now this IS amusing,&quot; Alucard smirked. &quot;The vanguard of the 
Hellsing Organization &#150; the legendary Wild Geese and their leader &#150; 
beaten-up by a little girl!&quot; He chuckled at the thought, which only got 
a dirty look from Sir Integra.

&quot;Believe me,&quot; the commander of the Wild Geese continued, &quot;we didn&#39;t 
think much of ze ourselves &#150; until we tried to force ourselves into ze 
place. And zen &#150; she proceeded to attack us in, what I guess, as some 
form of martial art!&quot; Pip slumped over as Walter continued to bandage 
him, &quot;Mon dieu, eef I wasn&#39;t so humiliated by ze experience, I would&#39;ve 
hired zat red-haired girl on the spot!&quot;

&quot;Somehow, I doubt she would agree, Captain,&quot; Walter said, finishing his 
job. &quot;Sir Integra, I believe it would be useless to antagonize these men 
further. After all, they did do the job you ordered them to do to best 
of their abilities.&quot;

It was a few seconds pausing before Sir Integra, who was counting to ten 
to center herself, spoke. &quot;I guess you are right, Walter.&quot; Looking at 
her butler, she added, &quot;What are their conditions?&quot;

&quot;Well... other than a few bumps and bruises... and in Captain 
Bernadotte&#39;s case several cracked ribs, I would say they will be quite 
well, given a few days rest that is,&quot; the old butler replied.

&quot;Very well. See to the rest of the men.&quot; Sir Integra then turned to 
Rally and Seras, who were still agog from the whole spectacle, and said 
sharply, &quot;You two &#150; in my office &#150; NOW!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; was Rally&#39;s eloquent answer.

&quot;But why, Sir Integra?&quot; asked Seras, also equally stunned.

&quot;I will explain as soon as you get there,&quot; was all the Hellsing leader 
said as she left the dispensary.

XXX

&quot;In retrospect, I should have expected something like this when I sent 
those men out,&quot; Sir Integra sighed, sitting at her desk, another cigar 
aglow in her hand. In front of the desk, Rally and Seras stood, still a 
little confused about the night&#39;s events. &quot;When I got the first reports, 
I should have sent you two instead of Pip and his men. This whole 
debacle is partly my fault.&quot;

&quot;Sent us to where, Sir Integra?&quot; Rally began. &quot;And what the hell 
happened that got Pip and his men all beat-up like that?&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; the Hellsing leader began. &quot;About a week ago, thirty 
kilometers outside and north of London, an establishment appeared and 
opened for business. Since then, it has drawn a sizable clientele, 
mostly from the lesbian community in town.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t seem very unusual,&quot; Rally remarked, &quot;although it&#39;s a bit odd 
that the Hellsing Organization would have an interest in a lesbian pub.&quot;

&quot;I am afraid you do not fully understand the situation yet, Rally,&quot; Sir 
Integra added. &quot;The establishment did not simply open for business from 
an existing location &#150; the building it is in suddenly appeared out of 
nowhere, no construction whatsoever.&quot;

Now the attention of the two vampires was grabbed. &quot;Out of nowhere?&quot; 
gasped Seras. &quot;Sir Integra, has anyone been harmed going to that pub?&quot;

&quot;That is the unusual part &#150; other than Pip and his men, no one attending 
that bar has ever been altered or harmed in any way,&quot; Sir Integra 
answered. &quot;In fact, from what we have been able to gather, the 
establishment has been steadily having repeat business for the past 
week. And it is not only from the lesbian community, I might add. Quite 
a few bisexual women have been visiting the bar as well, not to mention 
on occasion several married women have been often seen visiting the pub 
for,&quot; her dusky face blushed as she continued, &quot;shall I say &#150; discreet 
homosexual encounters.

&quot;Needless to say, as long as no one is being harmed, I would normally 
let this thing pass without incident.&quot; Then Sir Integra turned to her 
two agents and added, &quot;However, the way this public house had manifested 
itself is a mystery I will not allow unanswered &#150; not to mention the 
reasoning for my men being harmed! Therefore, I am sending you two to 
investigate this establishment. Your orders &#150; find out more about this 
place and determine if, aside from the obvious moral implications, it is 
a danger to the Church and Crown!&quot;

&quot;Alright!&quot; Rally exclaimed. &quot;Well what are we waiting for &#150; let&#39;s go!&quot; 
She then proceeded to the door, followed by Seras.

&quot;Rally, Seras &#150; wait!&quot; Sir Integra called out.

&quot;What are you talking about, Sir Integra?&quot; Seras said, surprised. &quot;We 
were only carrying out your orders! Why are you holding us back?&quot;

&quot;Because you will have to first cross the Thames River in order to head 
there, and it is currently high tide,&quot; the Hellsing leader explained, 
&quot;not to mention it is too late in the evening to proceed there. 
Therefore, it would be best to plan this out first.&quot; Sir Integra then 
looked at a chart, &quot;Now the tide will recede an hour before sunset 
tomorrow. Rally, you are sufficiently strong enough to withstand low 
sunlight, so you and Seras will set out for the establishment before 
sunset. Also, I suggest both of you dress accordingly; wear nothing that 
will identify you as members of the Hellsing Organization. And above all 
&#150; no weapons! This is an intelligence gathering mission, not a combat 
situation! I do not want to hear of innocent citizens suffering any sort 
of injury if some misunderstanding occurred!&quot;

&quot;Okay, I get it, Integra,&quot; Rally sighed, looking down to the floor and 
saying in a low voice, &quot;Damn, I&#39;m so not looking forward to going out in 
the sun. And going in that pub not armed &#150; that REALLY sucks!&quot;

&quot;Oh I think I may have something that might perk-up your spirits, 
Rally,&quot; Sir Integra said with a smile, reaching into a drawer of her 
desk. She then produced a small laminated card. &quot;The paperwork finally 
came through this morning.&quot;

Rally took a long look at the card Sir Integra had in her hand &#150; then 
broke out in a great, big smile. &quot;Integra &#150; is &#150; is that what I think it 
is?&quot;

&quot;Yes &#150; this is your driver&#39;s license, Rally,&quot; Sir Integra answered. &quot;It 
was not very easy, though. Because vampires do not photograph, we had to 
use and modify the picture from you old Illinois driver&#39;s license, but I 
believe it is a sufficient likeness to yourself. Also, the registration 
to your Cobra, as well as the license plates, arrived as well.&quot; She then 
looked at Rally, whose smile never faded. &quot;I take it that you are 
pleased, Rally?&quot;

&quot;Oh you&#39;re certain of that,&quot; Rally said as she reached for the license, 
only to have Sir Integra move it from her grasp. &quot;HEY!! WHAT GIVES, 
INTEGRA!?!?&quot; she cried out in obvious alarm.

&quot;I just wanted to add that, as well as the licensing, I am also paying 
for the car&#39;s insurance as well,&quot; Sir Integra smirked. &quot;Rally, I have 
seen the way you drive... I beg of you... do not wreck the car.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be careful, that car&#39;s my baby, now gimme the 
license, willya?&quot; Rally pleaded. Pausing for a bit, Sir Integra finally 
acquiesced, handing the driver&#39;s license to the dusky-skinned vampire. 
For a few second, Rally gazed at it, for which she started giggling, 
then raced out of the office, letting out a great cheer.

For a few seconds afterward, Seras and Sir Integra just stared at the 
door before turning to each other. &quot;She is happy, I can see that,&quot; the 
blonde vampire finally said, smiling.

&quot;Indeed she is, Seras dear,&quot; Sir Integra added, getting out of her chair 
and taking Seras into her arms. &quot;Please, I beg of you &#150; come back from 
this mission safely.&quot;

&quot;I will, Integra,&quot; Seras replied, briefly returning the embrace. &quot;So, 
shall we go to the motor pool and see how Rally is doing?&quot;

&quot;I think that is a good idea, Seras.&quot;

XXX

Walter was walking down the corridors of the second floor, a letter in 
his hand, when he happened to see Rally sliding down the banister from 
the third floor and racing towards the first floor stairs. &quot;Miss 
Vincent!&quot; the old butler called out to the rapidly-running Rally. &quot;You 
know you are not supposed to be running in the halls, no less sliding 
down the stairs!&quot;

&quot;I KNOW THAT WALTER, SORRY!!&quot; Rally happily exclaimed as she began 
sliding down the stairs. &quot;YAAAAHOOOO!!!!&quot;

&quot;But Miss Vincent...&quot; Walter pleaded, holding the letter, only to have 
his pleas unanswered. &quot;Now I wonder what she is excited about?&quot; he asked 
himself.

&quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious, old friend?&quot; Alucard said, appearing next to Walter. 
&quot;After all these months, Rally Vincent finally has been given permission 
to drive her treasured car, which she&#39;s been waiting to do since she 
arrived here.&quot;

&quot;Now that is a bit odd,&quot; Walter mused. &quot;Granted, I was excited myself 
when I obtained my first license, but never to the point of ignoring the 
rules of the house.&quot;

&quot;Oh I think that for once she can ignore those rules, Walter,&quot; Sir 
Integra said, walking with Seras. &quot;So, have the injured Wild Geese been 
tended to?&quot;

&quot;Indeed they have. Oh, this slipped my mind,&quot; Walter showed the letter 
to his employer. &quot;This came in the post this afternoon. Oddly, it is 
addressed to Miss Vincent, but she was in such a hurry I was unable to 
deliver it to her.&quot;

&quot;Let me do it, Walter,&quot; Alucard offered, taking the letter from the 
butler&#39;s hands. &quot;Someone of your age shouldn&#39;t be taking the stairs too 
often.&quot;

&quot;You should talk, you&#39;re at least five hundred years older than me, 
Alucard,&quot; Walter grumbled.

&quot;Let it go, Walter,&quot; Sir Integra laughed. &quot;Go ahead, Alucard. Rally 
should be at the motor pool by now.&quot;

XXX

Berttle, the Wild Geese member from Australia and in charge of the 
Hellsing Organization&#39;s vehicles, was finishing affixing the English 
license plates to the Cobra when he heard Rally race into the motor 
pool. For a few seconds, the dusky-skinned vampire paused, staring at 
her prized car while trembling giddily, then let out a huge squeal 
before embracing the top of the car. &quot;OH BABY,&quot; she shrieked, happily 
stroking the top, &quot;WE&#39;RE FINALLY TOGETHER AGAIN!!! OH I&#39;VE BEEN WAITING 
SO LONG FOR THIS DAY, I CAN HARDLY CONTAIN MYSELF!!!&quot;

&quot;Sounds like you&#39;re having trouble containing yourself as it is right 
now,&quot; Berttle said, startling Rally. &quot;So love, the lady finally let you 
drive it?&quot;

Rally was able to compose herself before saying, &quot;Oh... yeah, Sir 
Integra gave me my license just now. Berttle, thank you for taking care 
of my car while I was waiting.&quot;

&quot;Oh no worries, love,&quot; Berttle dismissed. &quot;Me old man used to have a 
Mustang when I was young, but nothing as bonzer as this one.&quot;

&quot;Nice to know that,&quot; Rally said as she looked around the car. Then she 
looked into the rear-view mirror... and frowned. &quot;You know... I&#39;m never 
going to get used to the fact of not seeing myself in a mirror.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it, fledgling,&quot; Alucard said, standing behind Rally 
and causing her to jump.

&quot;EEEEPPP!!! ALUCARD, DON&#39;T DO THAT, YOU KNOW I DON&#39;T LIKE IT!!!&quot;

&quot;My apologies,&quot; the No-Life King drolled, then handed the letter to 
Rally.

&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Rally asked, looking at the letter.

&quot;This arrived for you this afternoon, but because of the crisis we had 
earlier, Walter had forgotten to give it to you,&quot; Alucard said. &quot;They 
say it is the mind that is the first to go when you get older.&quot;

Rally just looked sourly at Alucard and grumbled, &quot;I don&#39;t think Walter 
would appreciate you saying that.&quot;

&quot;Oh I say it to him all the time,&quot; Alucard added, smiling evilly. Still 
giving the No-Life King a dirty look, Rally quickly examined the letter. 
It was addressed to her, but it had no return address. Curious, she 
opened the envelope and pulled-out the letter. She then began to read 
the letter &#150; and a look of horror and dread came over her face.

Alucard said nothing, but walked away quietly while Berttle only 
scratched his head. But after a few seconds, Rally collapsed on all 
fours, the letter still in her hands. &quot;Oh... no!&quot; she gasped, still 
trembling. &quot;How... how in the world am I going to explain... this?&quot;

XXX

The evening and following afternoon went by uneventfully, and in the 
late afternoon, Rally and Seras prepared for the mission. The Draculina, 
following Sir Integra&#39;s instructions, decided to forgo her usual uniform 
and dressed in a rather provocative manner. She had pulled-on the black 
top over her and began to strap-on the leather jewelry when she happened 
to look at Rally, who was sitting on the coffin/bed dressed in her 
normal outfit but without the Hellsing coat-of-arms affixed to the left 
sleeve and left breast. She still had the letter in her right hand. &quot;Is 
there something wrong?&quot; she asked.

&quot;What? Oh... nothing, Master,&quot; Rally said evasively, stuffing the letter 
in her right coat pocket. Finally taking notice of Seras&#39; 
manner-of-dress, she walked behind her and firmly groped both her 
breasts. &quot;You know,&quot; she purred, kissing her neck, &quot;if we weren&#39;t going 
on a mission right now, I would throw you on that bed, rip off those 
clothes and fuck you until you passed out.&quot;

Seras gasped, feeling her nipples hardening under Rally&#39;s hands. 
&quot;Rally... please, you&#39;re being WAY TOO FORWARD!!&quot; She then started 
giggling and added, &quot;Is that all you ever think about... cars, guns and 
shagging?&quot;

&quot;Believe me...&quot; Rally said, her voice breaking, &quot;I&#39;d rather do you... 
than go out in the sun!&quot; Rally&#39;s mood again flip-flopped, her hands 
suddenly trembling. &quot;Master... I&#39;m scared!&quot; she sobbed, bloody tears 
appearing on her face. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen when I step 
outside, when that sunlight hits me...&quot;

&quot;Relax, Rally,&quot; Seras reassured, releasing herself from Rally&#39;s grasp 
and comforting her shaking fledgling. &quot;There may be some discomfort at 
first, but you&#39;ll survive the sun.&quot; As she embraced a trembling Rally, 
the Draculina thought to herself, &#39;Besides... I seem to sense that the 
sun is the least of your worries right now, my dear Rally.&#39;

XXX

The time had came to begin the mission. Berttle brought the Cobra to the 
front of the mansion from the motor pool, where he gave the keys to 
Rally, who along with Seras, was situated in a shaded portion of the 
entrance. &quot;It&#39;s all yours, love,&quot; the Australian said.

&quot;Uh... you&#39;re welcome, Berttle,&quot; answered Rally, then as soon as he was 
out of earshot, she mumbled, &quot;Great... he had to park it in the sun.&quot;

&quot;Just be brave, Rally,&quot; Seras reassured, patting her shoulder.

Rally simply nodded, then taking a deep breath, took a few steps out of 
the shade... and staggered back, her eyes tightly closed. &quot;AUUUGGGHH!!! 
TOO BRIGHT... CAN&#39;T... SEE...&quot;

&quot;HOLD ON, RALLY!&quot; Seras called-out, steadying her fledgling. Noticing 
that Walter had arrived with a pair of wrap-around sunglasses in his 
hand, she motioned him closer. Taking the sunglasses in her hands, the 
Draculina guided the glasses in Rally&#39;s hands until she had them on. 
&quot;There... now try again,&quot; she said.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Rally managed to say. Even more gingerly, she inched her way out 
of the shade, her eyes still closed. As soon as she felt the sunlight on 
her skin, she slowly opened her eyes &#150; and felt no ill effects. &quot;Hmm... 
that&#39;s better,&quot; she said, &quot;although I got to admit, these glasses are a 
little darker than I expected them to be.&quot;

&quot;That was because I realized that one day, you might be forced to go out 
into the sun,&quot; Walter started. &quot;Therefore, I had designed those glasses 
with the same tinted lenses often found on welder&#39;s visors. My 
recommendation is that you wear those glasses until your eyes become 
accustomed to the sun.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that... and thanks, Walter, you&#39;re a real lifesaver,&quot; replied 
the dusky-skinned vampire, smiling.

Walter then gave one of his small but meaningful smiles before replying, 
&quot;I appreciate that. Now I suggest that you and your master get started 
on your mission. The tide should be receding by now. I will inform Sir 
Integra that you are on your way.&quot;

&quot;Yes Walter, you do that,&quot; Seras repeated. Entering the car, the two 
vampires then started the car and went on their way.

The drive, as well as the crossing of the Thames, went about smoothly. 
Despite the Cobra&#39;s configuration for American roads, Rally was able to 
adjust her usage of mirrors to compensate for the English roads. 
However, the two rarely talked until they left the city limits. &quot;Excuse 
me Rally,&quot; Seras began, &quot;but I was wondering if you were feeling 
alright.&quot;

&quot;Uh... yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Rally answered, almost evasively. &quot;You were 
right about the sun, Master. Other than the light, everything&#39;s 
alright.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not so sure of that, Rally,&quot; Seras countered. &quot;You seem a bit tense 
about now.&quot;

Rally laughed humorlessly. &quot;Really, it&#39;s fine,&quot; she repeated, almost 
nervously.

&quot;No it&#39;s not! Something&#39;s wrong, Rally,&quot; Seras said peevishly. &quot;Back at 
the mansion, you went from almost shagging my knickers off to crying 
like a girl sent to the school headmaster&#39;s office! Now level with me... 
what IS wrong?&quot;

&quot;Master, please, I would like to concentrate on the mission!&quot; the 
dusky-skinned vampire said, almost at the point of panic. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you 
later!&quot;

&quot;Rally Vincent,&quot; Seras repeated, her voice building an edge, &quot;either you 
tell me now what&#39;s wrong with you, or I&#39;ll find out by probing your 
mind!&quot;

&quot;MASTER... YOU WOULDN&#39;T!?!?&quot; Rally gasped, almost sideswiping a passing 
lorry.

&quot;In a second! Look, I promised your friend May I would look after you 
and I&#39;m not going to break that promise!&quot; Seras firmly said. &quot;Please... 
don&#39;t make me do something we&#39;ll both regret.&quot;

Rally gulped, feeling cornered. &quot;Okay Master, I&#39;ll tell you, just let me 
pull over first.&quot; She then pulled the Cobra to the left side shoulder 
and stopped the engine. She then slumped over the steering wheel, 
visibly shaking.

For about a minute, Rally rested on the steering wheel, struggling to 
compose herself. Finally leaning back on the seat, she looked over to 
Seras and said, &quot;Listen... have I ever told you about... Misty Brown, 
Master?&quot;

Seras thought for a second. &quot;About once or twice, I think.&quot; She looked 
at her fledgling and added, &quot;An old girlfriend of yours?&quot;

&quot;Not really, but you might say that,&quot; Rally muttered, laughing 
humorlessly. &quot;Misty was an old case of mine, a young catburgler I helped 
out of trouble one time. Found out she had a crush on me, but we both 
didn&#39;t really do anything about it.&quot; Stretching a bit, she added, &quot;For a 
while, Misty worked with me and May, mostly with the gunshop and chasing 
down bail jumpers... until Goldie returned one day. That bitch did some 
awful things to her, so much so she couldn&#39;t face meeting her again. She 
left Chicago two weeks before the Hellsing Organization arrived in 
Chicago.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; replied Seras, finally understanding what was happening. &quot;So... 
why has this gotten you all wound-up all of a sudden?&quot;

Rally then produced the letter she had in her pocked. &quot;This,&quot; she began. 
&quot;Seems that Misty returned to Chicago two weeks ago when she heard that 
Goldie was dead. When she found out the shop was sold to Roy and I moved 
out, she looked Becky up and asked her where I was. She then gave her 
the address to the mansion and sent this letter. She&#39;s coming to the 
mansion to visit tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Does she know you&#39;re a vampire now?&quot; the blonde vampire asked, alarmed.

&quot;She didn&#39;t say. Master... I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do! How in the 
world am I going to explain that, not to mention about the two of us?&quot; 
Rally managed to choke out, finding a tissue to blot out a bloody tear.

&quot;I don&#39;t really know, Rally,&quot; answered Rally. She then got her cellphone 
and added, &quot;I&#39;m going to have to contact Sir Integra about this. Maybe 
she might know of something. Now don&#39;t fret, I&#39;ll let her know that 
you&#39;re feeling out-of-sorts about the whole thing!&quot;

&quot;I just hope she doesn&#39;t pull us off the mission because of this,&quot; 
sighed Rally, again leaning her head on the wheel. &quot;This is one way to 
distract me from the whole thing... and I really want to find out about 
those that attacked Pip.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll let her know we&#39;re still go for the mission, Rally,&quot; Seras 
reassured, patting Rally&#39;s arm. &quot;You just get yourself relaxed and we&#39;ll 
be on our way again.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Master,&quot; Rally sighed, once again leaning back. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I 
didn&#39;t bring this up sooner. I should&#39;ve told you and Integra about this 
before we set out, but I was so out of it... I sort of froze up.&quot;

&quot;That you were,&quot; Seras chuckled.

THE HELLSING MANSION, A FEW MINUTES LATER...

&quot;Hmmm... I see,&quot; Sir Integra mused, sitting at her desk while on the 
phone. &quot;This is going to be very awkward, rest assured. Rally should 
have brought this little problem up sooner, Seras.&quot; She then listened 
further, &quot;No, I agree with Rally, the mission comes first. As soon as 
you are able, proceed ahead as planned. We will see if we can solve that 
problem on our end. Report when you have the information. Very well, 
proceed and may God watch over you.&quot; She then hung-up the phone and 
leaned over her desk, hands rubbing her temples.

As if expecting something like this, Walter entered the office, toting a 
cart of tea and assorted sandwiches and pastries. &quot;I take it that there 
is a slight problem?&quot; the butler asked, poring a cup a tea and 
presenting it to Sir Integra.

The Hellsing leader took a deep breath before continuing. &quot;Yes... it 
seems that Rally had neglected to mention that an old friend of hers, 
one Misty Brown, is coming over to visit in the morrow from Chicago.&quot;

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Walter said, offering sugar and milk. &quot;I suppose she does not 
know that Miss Vincent is a vampire now.&quot;

&quot;The letter Rally received did not mention that fact, Walter,&quot; Sir 
Integra continued. Sighing, she took the cup and added, &quot;To be frank, I 
am not certain how in God&#39;s name am I going to approach that fact.&quot;

&quot;Then perhaps I am the one to disclose that fact,&quot; Alucard&#39;s disembodied 
voice said. A startled Sir Integra and Walter soon witness the No-Life 
King walking through the office walls, his evil smirk on his face. 
&quot;After all, Miss Brown does deserve to know the truth about Rally, does 
she?&quot;

&quot;Even if that is true, Alucard,&quot; Sir Integra snarled, &quot;I do not want to 
hear some story that you&#39;ve terrorized that poor girl! Do I make myself 
clear?&quot;

&quot;Why of course, my master,&quot; Alucard smirked. &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry a 
thing, I will be the perfect gentleman in this matter.&quot;

Sir Integra placed her hands over her head and once again leaned upon 
the desk. &quot;Then why in the world am I not impressed with what you have 
said?&quot; she groaned.

PRESENT TIME...

For the most part, the drive to the objective was a rather uneventful 
one. Rally had managed to settle down long enough to drive steadily and 
without incident, while Seras maintained the course they were going. So 
it wasn&#39;t long before the two had reached their objective... where they 
stood a good distance away from the building in question, their faces 
betraying a look of incredulous disbelief. &quot;It&#39;s amazing that the 
uptights around here hadn&#39;t trashed this place yet, Master,&quot; Rally 
muttered.

&quot;It&#39;s about as bloody subtle as a brick through a window, Rally,&quot; Seras 
added.

The community the building was situated had house constructed mostly of 
brick and stonework. This building looked like a warehouse from some big 
city; constructed of corrugated steel that seemed to gleam as if 
brand-new. But the most outlandish feature of the place was the marquee 
of the building &#150; one constructed of pink neon tubes that spelled out in 
an elegant script &#39;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket&#39;. Below the script, a mechanical 
locket opened and closed repeatedly, the inside a picture of a pretty 
girl.

Rally simply scanned the building&#39;s exterior, then her &#39;third eye&#39; 
caught something. &quot;Master, take a look at that!&quot;

Seras concentrated on the feature her fledgling had pointed out. It was 
a small sign near the entrance. &quot;There&#39;s writing on it &#150; but I can&#39;t 
make out what it says.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s written in kanji &#150; Japanese writing!&quot; Rally added. &quot;Just what in 
the hell is a building from Japan doing in England?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what Sir Integra wanted to find out, Rally,&quot; the Draculina said, 
&quot;so I suggest we get ourselves inside.&quot; Rally nodded, and the two 
proceeded to the entrance.

Briefly, the two hesitated near the entrance. Guarding the door was 
apparently the place&#39;s bouncer &#150; a busty girl with red hair which 
trailed into a long narrow braid, wearing what appeared to be Chinese 
clothing, but did not appear to be Chinese at all. Rally leaned over to 
Seras, &quot;She must be the one who took on Pip and the others.&quot;

&quot;She looks so small,&quot; Seras repeated, &quot;but if she can handle someone 
like Pip, it&#39;s best we do not cause trouble.&quot; Rally nodded, then the two 
proceeded to the entrance.

The girl watching the entrance noticed the two approaching. &quot;Good 
evening, ladies. How is your...&quot; Her voice trailed off as her blue eyes 
went wide.

&quot;Oh, we&#39;re newcomers here,&quot; Rally said. &quot;Heard about the place and 
thought we&#39;d check it out.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Seras added, taking Rally&#39;s hand. &quot;A lot of the places here are a 
bit boring and maybe this might be a bit livelier.&quot;

&quot;Uh... yeah, have yourselves a good time, ladies,&quot; the red-haired girl 
said, still looking at the two &#150; or more specifically &#150; Rally.

As soon as they entered the coat-check area, they were greeted by what 
appeared to by a young woman with short, light-brown hair and dressed in 
what appeared to be a Japanese school uniform. &quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s 
Locket, ladies. I hope you have a... good... time.&quot; The girl seemed to 
be studying Rally&#39;s face.

The two vampires said nothing, nodding as they entered. But when they 
were out of earshot, the girl looked at the bouncer at the entrance. 
&quot;Ranma,&quot; she said in a low voice, &quot;did you see that other girl?&quot;

The bouncer &#150; Ramna Saotome &#150; nodded. &quot;That I did, Hitomi. You don&#39;t 
suppose there&#39;s going to be trouble, like yesterday &#150; when those men 
tried to crash in?&quot;

The other girl &#150; Hitomi Kanzaki &#150; just shook her head. &quot;No, I don&#39;t 
believe so &#150; that wasn&#39;t the impression I got when I saw that girl.&quot; She 
then picked up a phone receiver near her station and added, &quot;All the 
same, I had better contact Juri about it, just in case. If those two run 
into the others &#150; especially the dark-haired one &#150; she might be the one 
to prevent trouble before it starts.&quot;

Of course once inside, Rally and Seras made a quick scan of the 
interior. At one end of the club &#150; that seemed to be a better 
description of the place rather than &#39;pub&#39; &#150; there was a kareoke stage, 
which was quite busy. Also nearby the stage appeared what looked like a 
small library, and several of the books were actively being perused by 
some of the patrons. A quite sizable dance floor was in the center, and 
many of the women were dancing together.

However, the more interesting area of the club was the bar, which was 
being tended by the most unusual bartenders the two vampires had ever 
seen &#150; they appeared to be twin sisters, with long and wild cyan-colored 
hair and golden eyes, and except for one of them that had identical 
crescent-shaped scars on her cheeks, it would be hard-pressed to try to 
tell the two of them apart. &#39;So far Master, it doesn&#39;t seem too unusual 
&#150; except for those bartenders,&#39; Rally thought to Seras.

The Draculina nodded and added, &#39;All the same, I think we should try to 
get settled-in and try to find out more on why this place is here.&#39; She 
saw a vacant table and pointed it out to Rally, &#39;I think we should try 
to sit at that table there and catch up on what the other girls are 
saying.&#39;

Rally nods in agreement, and the two of them migrate through the throng 
of women to the table Seras indicated. It was while they were doing this 
that Rally found herself bumped from behind. &quot;Look, miss,&quot; she grumbled, 
turning to face the offender, &quot;you better watch were you&#39;re going 
before... HOLY CRAP!!!&quot;

&quot;Rally,&quot; Seras said, turning as well, &quot;is there anything... STONE THE 
CROWS!?!?&quot; The Draculina found herself wondering if her eyesight was 
playing tricks on her... for she discovered she was staring at TWO Rally 
Vincents, each staring at each other.

&quot;Wha... what the devil are you?&quot; the second Rally gasped. This one was 
obviously different the first &#150; mainly because she had blue eyes rather 
than red.

&quot;That&#39;s what I was going to ask you,&quot; the first Rally asked, still in 
shock from seeing her human double in front of her.

&quot;Rally... is there something wrong?&quot; another voice called out from 
behind the second Rally... and walked out in front of the other... a 
young, brown-haired girl with green eyes that bugged-out from seeing the 
first Rally. &quot;Wha... what the...?&quot; she gasped.

&quot;MISTY!?!? WHAT THE DEVIL ARE YOU DOING HERE!?!?! AND WHO IS... IS 
THAT!?!?&quot; the first Rally growled, her red eyes starting to glow.

&quot;Who am I?&quot; the second Rally also growled. &quot;I&#39;m Rally Vincent, that&#39;s 
who! And just who are you, for crying out loud?&quot;

Seras wasn&#39;t liking this situation one bit. Her fledgling was beginning 
to show the first signs of a berserker rage at seeing her double, which 
could end-up deadly in this crowded building. But before she could act, 
yet another voice called out, &quot;Is there something wrong, ladies?&quot;

Everyone turned around to face a rather beautiful woman with orange-red 
hair, wearing a business suit, walking up to the two. &quot;Oh my,&quot; she 
gasped, her green eyes widening.

The second Rally turned to the newcomer. &quot;Juri, what the hell&#39;s going 
on?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;Y-yes,&quot; Misty whimpered, &quot;that other Rally... she&#39;s scaring us!&quot;

The woman scanned the scene carefully, sighed and said, &quot;Oh well... 
Washu did say I should expect this sort of thing one of these days. I 
really hate playing the peacemaker.&quot; She then approached the two 
vampires and began with, &quot;Ladies, I know this is rather... unusual... 
but I must ask both of you to refrain from any violence in my club!&quot;

It took a while, but the glow in the first Rally&#39;s eyes soon faded and 
she showed some signs of calm. &quot;Okay, I&#39;m calm,&quot; she said, &quot;now could 
you please explain how in the world there are TWO of me... and the other 
one&#39;s still a human, Miss... uh... what&#39;s you&#39;re name?&quot;

&quot;Oh that... it&#39;s Juri Arisugawa. I&#39;m the owner of this bar.&quot; Juri then 
looked at Seras. &quot;So there is another of you... very fascinating.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Seras gasped, clearly surprised. &quot;You... you mean... you met 
another... me?&quot;

&quot;Look, I know you have a bunch of questions you both need answered,&quot; 
Juri explained. &quot;However, I suggest we sit down first before things get 
heated again.&quot; She then mumbled to herself, &quot;At least it&#39;ll give me a 
chance to recharge before returning to Nakibi and her figures for the 
last month.&quot;

&quot;Sound sensible to me,&quot; the second Rally said. &quot;I&#39;m about as mystified 
as everyone else.&quot; Misty and the two vampires also nodded, with the 
first Rally looking nervously at the brown-haired girl.

&quot;Good. So we&#39;re in agreement then.&quot; Juri then turned to the unscarred 
bartender, &quot;Ryoko, could you do me a favor?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, boss,&quot; Ryoko Hakubi answered, turning around. &quot;What is it that 
you... whoa!!!&quot; she yelped, seeing the two Rallys. &quot;What is this, 
&#39;Double-your-pleasure&#39; day or what?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll explain later... I hope,&quot; Juri sighed. &quot;Right now, could you get 
me my usual... and two glasses of 0-negative for our guests?&quot; She turned 
to the vampires and added, &quot;My treat. At least it&#39;ll help smooth things 
over.&quot;

&quot;Whatever you say,&quot; the first Rally sighed. &quot;I&#39;m still wondering the 
last bag I drank was tainted or not.&quot;

&quot;The same here,&quot; Seras added as she, the two Rallys, Misty and Juri 
settled down at a nearby table.

TO BE CONTINUED...

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE 2 &#150; For your information, the extra Rally (with Misty) 
were featured in another of Shanejayell&#39;s stories &#39;One Shot&#39;. All this 
time since the &#39;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket&#39; series started, I began to wonder 
what, in the unlikely chance, would happen if one character were to meet 
the other at the Locket. I just hope I got this right.

And don&#39;t worry &#150; the complete guest list will, like I said earlier, be 
posted, with creators and licensors, at the end.

So until part 2... LATER!</pre>
