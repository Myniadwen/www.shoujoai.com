<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Reloaded (part 4 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../hellsing/bshbreload-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Utena&#39;s robin egg&#39;s blue eyes suddenly snapped open as the final rays of 
sunlight faded from the dorm room giving way to the lengthening shadows 
of twilight. She lay there, deathly still, and slowly felt life and 
motion begin to return to her chill flesh and bones, the thick blood 
starting to pump ever so slowly through her veins. She took a short, 
shallow breath, then a nearly full one, more out of an old reflex than 
any real need for air.

A soft sigh echoed through the small room. `It&#39;s time for me to go out 
and feed again,&#39; Utena thought to herself sadly, feeling the first few 
sharp stabs of the hunger pulsing through her rake thin form. She slowly 
sat up, her bone white skin made to seem even more pale by the vividness 
of her pink hair and sapphire blue eyes.

The room was, as always, shadowed and musty, deserted for such a long 
time before it&#39;s new occupant had decided to move in. It almost looked 
like a mockery of one of the school&#39;s regular dorm rooms, filled up with 
only the cast offs of the school&#39;s students. There was the battered desk 
and discarded chairs, the wardrobe with the single door falling off, the 
mouldy bed and the threadbare rug that covered up the bare planks of the 
floor.

Utena eased herself up out of the musty, once abandoned bed and quickly 
washed herself as clean as she could in a nearby basin full of icy cold 
water. The chill of the water should have made her shiver but the young 
vampiress found she could easily ignore it. She then smoothly pulled on 
her usual boy&#39;s school uniform with a feline, unearthly kind of grace 
that even after all of these weeks, she still found just a little 
disturbing.

Her new, more powerful senses suddenly expanded outward, reaching across 
the room to the four corners of the deserted building. `There&#39;s someone 
alive out there,&#39; Utena thought, the person&#39;s nervous heartbeat as loud 
as a drum to her new senses.

The sound of footsteps, a soft knocking on the door, and Utena knew who 
it was as she said to her softly, &quot;Please come in, Wakaba.&quot;

The younger girl opened the door and came in, before closing it quietly 
behind her. Utena could smell the sweet scent of her warm flesh, almost 
feel the blood that pumped in the girl&#39;s veins, and her fangs extended, 
suddenly aching to be used. There was soap and a hint of something else, 
one that she instinctively recognized as sexual.

Wakaba visibly shivered as she saw the hungry, almost feral look that 
come over Utena&#39;s normally handsome face. Without intending to, she 
slowly walked closer and closer towards her, almost hypnotized by what 
she saw in those bright blue eyes. With violently shaking hands she 
clumsily rolled up her sleeve and extended her pale, pink arm, even as 
she said to her huskily, &quot;What ever you need, Utena. Please, take it.&quot;

Utena reluctantly grasped at that outstretched arm, her hunger 
controlling her more than she it. Then with what seemed like a nearly 
superhuman effort she cried out, &quot;No, Wakaba!&quot; Eyes locked Wakaba and 
Utena stood there then as gently as she could manage she pushed her 
away. Utena continued on, her voice hoarse, almost raspy, &quot;I swore that 
I wouldn&#39;t. Please, just watch this place, and I&#39;ll be back soon.&quot;

Eyes stinging with tears Utena all but ran away from Wakaba, leapt out 
the upper window and then hit the ground below like a cat, sprinting 
away into the forest that lay all around Ohtori. &#39;I condem the other 
vampires for acting on their hungers,&#39; she thought bitterly as she 
raced, &#39;but I&#39;m just the same as they are. I justr hide it better.&#39;

Standing there in the open window Wakaba watched her go and silently 
prayed that Utena would be all right. Then with a soft sigh she turned 
away, wishing that once, just once, Utena&#39;s iron self control would slip 
and let her do what they both so desired.

Out in the night the lone deer paused in it&#39;s feeding and raised it&#39;s 
head enquiringly, looking around for whatever had disturbed it. The 
figure silently came up out from the shadows and in a single forceful 
gesture broke it&#39;s neck with a loud snap!

With an unnatural strength Utena roughly picked up the deer, then in a 
swift savage motion buried her fangs in it&#39;s throat, letting her mouth 
fill with the animal&#39;s rich hot blood. She gulped it down hungrily, 
repelled by the taste but knowing that she had to feed or else she would 
truly die the final death. The blood punped, slowing, then her hunger 
finally sated, she picked up the bloodless corpse and then carried it on 
her shoulder over to a nearby pathway. She knew it was used by the local 
wolf pack, so the meat wouldn&#39;t go to waste.

She owed Wakaba so much, Utena thought to herself as she stood there in 
blood splattered clothing. The young girl had come upon her, Utena only 
just changed to a vampire and nearly mad with her hunger, and she had 
bravely caught her a rat to feed from. Utena quickly learned how to feed 
herself and while the animals&#39; blood tasted awful to her new taste buds, 
she could at least live her new life ethically.

`Unlike some of the other residents of this vampire haunted academy of 
Ohtori,&#39; Utena thought to herself grimly. With that thought foremost in 
her mind Utena made her way back to Ohtori, and a appointment she really 
must keep...

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

Juri stretched out like a jungle cat as she awoke, feeling the warmth of 
her chosen companion laying on the queen sized bed just beside her. 
Shiori sweetly smiled in her sleep, arcing her body up so that her neck 
and the rise of her bare breasts were open and totally available to 
Juri&#39;s each and every whim. Juri bent over her to kiss her lips lightly, 
then she slipped out from between the silken covers and padded nude out 
of the luxurious bedroom.

Arisugawa Juri was a beautiful woman when she was alive, the leader of 
the fencing club and admired by many of the students. With her orange 
hair, flashing eyes and body she had raised the desires of many men and 
women. But her secret shame had been her desires for the fairer sex, her 
longing for those soft, beautiful forms.

&quot;I&#39;m glad that&#39;s over,&quot; Juri smiled, her breasts standing firm. Her 
transition to vampirism had changed things, freeing her to persue her 
needs and desires as she chose.

Much like this suite she now lived it. It had once been two dorm rooms, 
but she had gone to the woman in charge of housing and had a little... 
talk with her. The older woman had been so willing, her nude form spread 
out over the desk and Juri had easily sated both her hungers for sex and 
blood that day. And of course the next day the workers had arrived to 
knock down the connecting walls and readied her new rooms in record 
time.

Ruka silently met her at the bedroom door and handed her a clean and 
ironed school uniform. &quot;You&#39;re not...?&quot; he softly asked, nodding towards 
where the still deeply sleeping Shiori lay, looking like some earthy 
angel fallen from the heavens.

Juri smiled slightly and shrugged, &quot;I think two nights in a row might be 
a little too much for her, it could put her life at risk.&quot; She fixed him 
with a intense gaze, commanding, &quot;Ruka, make sure she eats well, 
spinach, liver, and other iron rich foods to restore the blood. I don&#39;t 
want my chosen companion getting sick on me.&quot;

&quot;Of course, master, whatever you wish,&quot; Ruka said with a nod, and then 
he bowed to her in a semi-mocking way.

Juri shot him an annoyed look as she snarled at him, &quot;Do not call me 
that, Ruka.&quot; For only a moment, she wore the face of a savage predator, 
a visage that often meant a long and painful death to those who chanced 
to see it.

Ruka seemed distinctly unworried as he cheerfully protested, &quot;Aw, but it 
spoils the whole vampire queen and servant riff we&#39;ve got going!&quot;

Juri shook her head and laughed softly at his mad antics. &quot;See you 
later,&quot; she said, and disappeared into the night.

Juri silently made her way across the rain damp rooftops to a nearby 
dorm and then she gracefully crawled down the wall until she found the 
room that she had decided to visit tonight. The girl living there had 
seen her feed on another of her dorm-mates earlier that week but instead 
of screaming and running from Juri in fear, she had instead opened the 
top of her sheer night gown, revealing her pale throat and the tops of 
her pert little breasts.

Juri was too full to feed on her then, so instead she had just smiled at 
her toothily and softly promised her, &quot;Later.&quot;

The girl shifted in her bed, the cold night&#39;s breeze coming through the 
little blonde&#39;s newly open window gradually awakening her. Her blue eyes 
opened, then they snapped wide as she gasped out softly, &quot;Juri-sama!&quot;

Juri noted the rise and fall of the breasts beneath the sheets speeding 
up, and felt the tingle of her fangs extending. Juri smiled down at her, 
stepping closer, &quot;I told you I&#39;d be back.&quot; She held herself back, 
waiting as she said softly, &quot;Would you like me to lie with you?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; the girl squeaked happily, and Juri smiled down at her 
fondly. She gently flipped the covers back and Juri got another very 
pleasant surprise: the girl now slept nude. Juri gently fondled and 
stroked the shapely breasts as she lay down beside her, then she let one 
hand slowly and teasingly slide down the girl&#39;s exposed front.

`I should give her some pleasure first,&#39; Juri thought to herself wryly, 
`to balance out the pain.&#39;

&quot;Oh,&quot; the little blonde whimpered as Juri kissed her breasts, raspy 
tongue stroking so sweetly. Juri let a hand slide down, stroking all the 
firm, hot body until she finally reached the very edge of the girl&#39;s 
pubic hair.

&quot;Do you want me?&quot; Juri asked, looking up to meet those desire clouded 
blue eyes.

&quot;Mistress,&quot; she panted, &quot;please!&quot;

&#39;I don&#39;t like Ruka calling me that,&#39; Juri thought with amusement, &#39;but a 
lady can call me that anytime.&#39; Under Juri&#39;s skilled fingers the girl 
writhed, then shuddered as the orgasms came tearing through her slim 
body one after the other. Just as she came, Juri brought her mouth to 
one silken breast and bit down with her fangs!

The girl cried out softly as she came again and again while Juri fed, 
the pleasure and pain merging into one in her fevered mind. Juri felt 
the flow of blood from the girl weaken and reluctantly released her. 
Juri didn&#39;t feed to kill, just to eat enough for her own survival. She 
lapped the last traces of the crimson blood away, unique saliva from her 
tongue sealing up the tiny wounds, and then she departed, leaving the 
girl to sleep the rest of the truly satisfied.

Juri stood out on the rooftop and smiled slightly to herself, waiting 
under the moonlight for a few moments. &quot;You can come out, now,&quot; Juri, 
tired of the cat and mouse games, said calmly to the figure who stood 
concealed in the shadows.

&quot;You&#39;ve let them live so far,&quot; Utena said to Juri quietly as she moved 
almost silently from the concealing depths of the night. &quot;That&#39;s the 
only reason that I&#39;ll let you live.&quot; With that ominous statement she 
disappeared once more into the darkness.

&quot;Killjoy,&quot; Juri said with a wry smile. &quot;She has got to learn to take 
herself less seriously,&quot; she said to herself softly. Her expression 
darkened, she knew Utena wasn&#39;t someone to underestimate. She had 
already slain the vampire Lord Akio, after all...

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

Touga easily held the struggling girl, laughing happily as she flailed 
away against his chest. He looked deeply into her eyes, and her 
struggles slowly ebbed. He didn&#39;t take all her will away, that would 
spoil his fun. He liked seeing the terror in their wide eyes, the rapid 
pulse hammering like a drum, it made the feeding so much sweeter.

&quot;Kozue,&quot; Touga said to her with a smile, &quot;don&#39;t you want to be with me? 
I remember a time when you would have fallen into my arms easily.&quot;

&quot;Please, no,&quot; Kozue whimpered back weakly. &quot;I want to live,&quot; she said 
breathlessly.

&quot;Oh, but you will,&quot; Touga said with a smile, letting his fangs gleam in 
the moonlight, &quot;You&#39;ll get to live forever, just like I will.&quot;

He heard the footsteps before the door opened, and wondered who was so 
utterly foolish as to think about trying to interfere. The door opened, 
he caught the scent, and began to laugh softly to himself. &quot;Come in, 
Miki,&quot; Touga invited him.

The blue hared young man carried a cross in one hand and a sharpened 
stake in the other. &quot;Please, let her go, Touga,&quot; Miki half asked, and 
half pled. His hands shook violently as a smiling Touga met his eye, 
looking over at him quite calmly. `He knows I&#39;m no threat,&#39; Miki thought 
to himself despairingly, even as he felt his will begin to falter.

Then a calm female voice spoke up from the shadows, &quot;He said, let her 
go.&quot; Before Touga could even react, Kozue was plucked from his grasp and 
forcefully flung aside.

&quot;Utena,&quot; Kozue gasped out disbelievingly, instantly recognizing the 
supposedly missing and presumed dead student.

Utena took a moment to push her hair up out from her eyes before she 
fixed Miki with a intense look. &quot;Get her out of here, now&quot; she commanded 
him calmly, keeping an eye on Touga as the two fled for their lives.

Touga looked at her in utter shock, &quot;What are you doing, Tenjou? They 
are our prey!&quot; He shook his head as if he didn&#39;t understand her at all.

&quot;They were our friends, once,&quot; Utena answered him calmly. She smiled a 
bit, &quot;But this isn&#39;t the time for debate.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Touga admitted, standing a bit straighter as he seemed to try and 
marshal his strength. He met Utena&#39;s gaze calmly, their wills battling 
invisibly for supremacy.

Utena smiled ferally, hefting Miki&#39;s discarded stake in her hand. &quot;Come 
on,&quot; she softly invited him, &quot;lets see what you&#39;ve got.&quot;

Without any warning, they leapt at each other almost at the same time, 
colliding in midair like some twisted kind of aerial ballet. They madly 
scrambled at each other for a moment before both of them returned to the 
Earth. Touga reached up to his shoulder, a surprised expression on his 
face, and his hand came away bloody.

&quot;You are such a fool, Tenjou,&quot; Touga said softly, looking down at his 
blood stained palm. He clenches it into a fist, crying out, &quot;You fed 
from Lord Akio himself! You should be ruling over the student council, 
not fighting us!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not interested in ruling,&quot; Utena said to him calmly in reply and 
then she charged him once again, wooden stake ready.

Touga seemed to change, the normally handsome face fading away as the 
monster within him came out to play. His hands bent like claws he tore 
at Utena, his fangs snapping as he fought to gain any advantage that he 
could over her.

Utena cried out as his claws raked across her brow, red blood spilling 
down into her eyes. She swept it away with a single gesture, but not 
quite fast enough to save her from his next strike. The blow to her 
stomach staggered her backward, buying just enough time for him to leap 
through the window and disappear out into the night.

She moved to the window to chase after him, then she stopped cold. `Out 
there in the dark, the hunter could easily become the hunted,&#39; she 
thought to herself grimly. She turned and walked out of the room into 
the hallway, only to be met by both Miki and Kozue.

&quot;You&#39;re all right!&quot; Kozue cried out happily. She ran forward, throwing 
herself into hugging Utena, continuing quite tearfully, &quot;I though I was 
dead for sure!&quot;

The rich scent of human blood was all over the young girl, many freshly 
made cuts and scrapes that were the obvious consequences of her fight 
with Touga. The scent seemed to reach out to a hidden part of Utena, 
summoning forth a primal hunger. For just a moment, her arms tightened 
around the smaller girl as her fangs extended.

Kozue looked up to catch that hunger, that want and oddly she smiled. 
Submissively she visibly relaxed in Utena&#39;s arms, her head tilting back 
a bit as she cooed, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Utena quickly and roughly pushed the girl away, apologizing to the both 
of them even as she turned and fled down the deserted hallways. Standing 
there Miki turned disbelievingly to his twin sister as he sighed, &quot;I 
can&#39;t believe you sometimes.&quot;

Kozue looked towards where Utena had fled, the oddest look of longing on 
her face as her breasts rapidly rose with her exited breath. &quot;Neither 
can I,&quot; she admitted softly.

Only when she was far enough away so that she could no longer pick up 
the sweet scent of Kozue&#39;s fresh blood did Utena finally stumble to a 
stop. She leaned up against the stone wall, her body shaking slightly in 
reaction. &quot;I nearly,&quot; she gasped out softly, &quot;I nearly hurt her.&quot; A 
single tear, a lone trickle of red blood, coursed down her white cheek.

Juri watched from the shadows, carefully concealing herself from all of 
Utena&#39;s razor sharp senses. `Poor little girl,&quot; Juri thought sadly, 
`fighting what you are.&#39; She smiled, a slow, sexy smile, `Let me teach 
you what you can be.&#39;

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

It was nearly noon when the taxi finally pulled up in front of Ohtori 
academy. No one traveled much at night anymore, at least not in this 
part of the world. The cab driver quickly helped the young lady unpack 
her bags then he climbed back into his cab. With a loud squeal of his 
tires he was gone, fleeing as quickly as possible.

&quot;Was it something I said?&quot; Smiling Anthy shook out her short purple 
hair, hefting her cases as she looked around the courtyard thoughtfully. 
She dressed traditionally, a long dark dress and simple white blouse, 
white socks and black leather shoes.

`If the reports I&#39;ve heard are true,&#39; Anthy thought, `I&#39;ll find my 
brother here.&#39; She smiled to herself grimly, thinking of the wooden 
stakes that she carried in her bag, `And at long last I will end the 
curse on our family line.&#39;

She quickly arranged for her registration and found some sleeping 
quarters, then she began to check out the school itself. The first thing 
she did was find the temporary head of the student council, a young man 
named Miki Kaoru.

The blue hared young man looked nervous, even twitchy, sitting there at 
the head of the table in the large meeting room. His school uniform 
looked rumpled, as if he had dressed hurriedly that morning and the bags 
under his eyes showed a distinct lack of sleep. &quot;How can I help you, 
Mrs. Anthy?&quot; he asked her softly.

She smiled slightly as she explained, &quot;I&#39;m here looking for my brother.&quot; 
At Miki&#39;s inquiring look, she elaborated, &quot;Akio Ohtori.&quot;

The blood seemed to drain from the boy&#39;s face and for a moment Anthy 
feared that he might faint dead. &quot;He&#39;s gone,&quot; Miki said to her simply, 
his pale hands visibly shaking as he folded them on the table in front 
of him.

&quot;Gone,&quot; Anthy echoed the word, a flash of despair rising up in her. `Has 
he escaped me once again?&#39; she frantically wondered. In a fierce tone of 
voice she demanded, &quot;So where did he go? How long has he been gone?&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; Miki said, shaking his head slightly as he held up a hand to 
stop her questions. &quot;Akio Ohtori is dead,&quot; he said to her softly.

&quot;Dead,&quot; Anthy said disbelievingly. She looked lost, somehow, as if she 
had lost something incredibly precious. &quot;Who did it?&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t there to see it myself,&quot; Miki said to her quietly, &quot;but I 
understand that it was by Tenjou Utena&#39;s hand.&quot;

Miki was visibly surprised as Anthy suddenly rose from her chair, a 
thoughtful expression on her beautiful face. &quot;Thank you for your time, 
Mr. Kaoru,&quot; Anthy said to him, giving him a small bow. She left, 
frowning and lost in thought.

The rest of the day Anthy relentlessly pursued her new quarry, this 
mysterious Tenjou Utena. She talked to students and teachers, quickly 
gathering a sense of who she had been. But Utena hadn&#39;t been seen for 
months, shortly after the disappearance of most of the old student 
council. Anthy quickly reached certain conclusions.

`It&#39;s likely this Utena is a vampire, one created by Akio himself,&#39; she 
thought. `Somehow, the young vampire turned the tables on her elder, 
destroying him. But why? To rule the other vampires of Ohtori herself?&#39; 
she wondered

Anthy shook her head as she said aloud, &quot;It didn&#39;t matter, really. All 
that matters is that Utena is a vampire, and it&#39;s my duty to slay her.&quot;

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

Wakaba;&#39;s eyes widened slightly as she saw Kozue waiting for her, the 
setting sun sending long shadows over the ground. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell 
me?&quot; Kozue asked as they fell into step.

Wakaba sighed softly, instantly knowing what Kozue was talking about. 
&quot;She saved you from one of them last night?&quot; Wakaba asked in 
confirmation.

&quot;Touga,&quot; Kozue nodded slightly. She had the oddest look on her face as 
she quietly said, &quot;Utena, she&#39;s so beautiful... and terrible, somehow.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Wakaba nodded her agreement. Getting back to the original 
question she said, &quot;Utena asked me not to tell, she thought it was for 
the best if people didn&#39;t know she was still alive.&quot;

Koxue nodded slightly, noticing they were headed towards the abandoned 
dorm. &quot;I&#39;d better head back,&quot; she said before adding, &quot;tell Utena that I 
want to help, if she&#39;ll let me.&quot;

Wakaba shook her head with a soft sigh, knowing that this was going to 
make things more complicated. She went into the dorm and took the 
rickety stairs up, then down the hallway to the corner room Utena had 
chosen. Wakaba pushed open the door without knocking and before Utena 
could even finish washing herself off.

&quot;Do you mind?&quot; Utena said with a little frown, standing there naked.

&quot;It&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t seen it all before,&quot; Wakaba said with a little 
shrug, her gaze lingering on Utena&#39;s body. She frowned slightly, 
&quot;There&#39;s a strange lady at the school, asking around about Akio and you, 
too. She says her name&#39;s Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know her,&quot; Utena said.

&quot;And Kozue knows about you,&quot; Wakaba added, &quot;and wants to help.&quot;

&quot;I hadn&#39;t expected that....&quot; Utena started to say, when the dorm room 
door was suddenly slammed open, a slim figure leaping inside.

&quot;Hold, spawn of darkness!&quot; Anthy declared, holding a cross in one hand 
and a stake in the other. &quot;Step away from the girl!&quot;

Utena and Wakaba stood there motionless for a moment. &quot;Would you mind if 
I finish getting dressed first?&quot; Utena asked her mildly, casually 
covering up her breasts and pussy with her hands.

&quot;Yeah, you shouldn&#39;t be here seeing my Utena-sama naked,&quot; a frowning 
Wakaba said to Anthy firmly, stepping up to her and then turning her 
right around. Under her breath she quickly added, &quot;Only I get to do 
that.&quot;

&quot;I heard that,&quot; Utena shot back, dressing as quickly as possible.

Anthy looked at Wakaba in surprise, &quot;The vampire wasn&#39;t attacking you? I 
guess you must be her servant, then.&quot;

Utena laughed softly at that. &quot;If she is,&quot; Utena said, her voice a 
little muffled as she pulled a shirt over her head, &quot;can I trade her in 
on an more obedient model?&quot;

Wakaba stuck her tongue out, &quot;Bleah!&quot;

Anthy looked back and forth in confusion between the two young women. 
She finally sighed softly to herself as she said, &quot;It seems that I don&#39;t 
quite understand what&#39;s going on here. Would you two care to explain?&quot;

Finally dressed in her boy&#39;s uniform, Utena lit a small oil lamp, 
bringing some light into the long abandoned dorm room. She sat Anthy 
down in one of the salvaged chairs, a bit rickety but still stable. 
Wakaba took the other one, and Utena leaned up against the far wall, 
keeping some space between her and them.

&quot;You know what Akio was,&quot; Utena said softly to Anthy. The girl nodded, 
and she continued, &quot;I must have caught his eye, shortly after I 
transferred here. He courted me, tried to win me over, and when his 
charm failed him, he took me by force.&quot;

&quot;He raped me first, repeatedly, then he bit me,&quot; Utena said coldly, 
tipping her head back a bit to reveal the two faint fang marks still 
lingering on her pale neck, &quot;but for some reason he decided to turn me. 
He cut his arm, pressed it to my lips and then his foul blood filled my 
mouth until I had to swallow it down or choke.&quot;

&quot;She woke up three days later,&quot; Wakaba said quietly, sounding much more 
serious. &quot;We were roommates, and I saw Akio bring her back and leave her 
there. Because of some of the stories about him, I was worried about 
her.&quot;

Utena closed her eyes, looking away from the two of them. She continued 
softly, &quot;When I awoke, I was ravenous with the hunger for blood. I 
fought against it as hard as I could, kept myself from trying to attack 
her, and thankfully, Wakaba quickly figured out what I had become. She 
went out into the hallway and caught me a rat to feed on.&quot;

&quot;Akio must have thought you&#39;d feed on your friend,&quot; a thoughtful Anthy 
said softly. &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a newborn vampire resisting their 
hunger before,&quot; Annthy&#39;s voice held a kind of wonder in it, shaking her 
head in admiration.

&quot;It hasn&#39;t been easy,&quot; Utena said to her softly and Anthy suddenly 
understood why she kept her distance from them. She looked at the pale 
face lit by the golden lamp light, and was a little in awe of the 
strength she saw there.

Wakaba took up the story again, &quot;We moved Utena into this abandoned dorm 
that night, and she hunted out in the woods for the first time.&quot; She 
looked very passionate as she added, &quot;She only feeds on animals, not 
humans, Ms Anthy.&quot;

&quot;For now,&quot; Anthy said softly in return.

&quot;For now,&quot; Utena quietly agreed with her. Her eyes met Anthy&#39;s steadily 
as she said, &quot;And if I ever cross that line to feed on human beings, I 
hope there&#39;ll be someone like you around here to stop me.&quot; She took a 
deep breath, continuing, &quot;Eventually, I faced Akio. He underestimated my 
strength, I think, and I was able to stake him.&quot;

Wakaba sighed softly, &quot;But he was a busy little vampire before Utena 
stopped him. He turned most of the student council to vampires.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been trying to stop them ever since,&quot; Utena sighed.

Anthy looked over at the two young women thoughtfully, weighing their 
words. `I don&#39;t think they&#39;re lying,&#39; she mused and rose to her feet. 
&quot;I&#39;m going to go check out your story,&quot; she said to them respectfully, 
&quot;If you&#39;ve told me the truth, I&#39;d like to help you.&quot; Slightly grimly, 
she added, &quot;If you&#39;ve lied to me, I&#39;ll stake you.&quot;

&quot;Medium rare for me, please,&quot; a smiling Wakaba quipped, spoiling a 
serious moment. She got a glare from both Utena and Anthy, though a 
smile teased at Utena&#39;s lips. &quot;Sorry, couldn&#39;t resist,&quot; she said with a 
small shrug.
