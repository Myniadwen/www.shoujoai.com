<h1>Guilty Pleasures: A Tale of Hellsing</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>When you have a hobby that you&#39;re vaguely embarrassed
by, you tend to keep it a secret and are uncomfortable
when others learn of it. Still, you eventually find
yourself adapting, and can even come to share your
hobby with your friend.

&quot;So where did you get this?&quot; Seres Victoria asked
eagerly as they settled in on the couch together. The
smaller blonde was dressed in her pajamas, the pink
cloth increasing her usually cute look. Despite being
a full born vampire and second in command of
Hellsing&#39;s military forces she still looked like a
pixysh teen.

&#39;A very young, very cute pixy at that,&#39; Integra
Hellsing found herself noting a bit uncomfortably, her
own pajamas colored a midnight blue. &quot;From Walter,
actually,&quot; the silver haired woman said with some
amusement. She cradled a tub of popcorn in her arms, a
glass of soda waiting nearby.

&quot;Walter?&quot; Seres looked faintly surprised as Integra
started up the DVD. She found it hard to imagine the
stuffy looking butler with the veiled sense of humor
acquiring this sort of film, though she supposed she
shouldn&#39;t be all that surprised.

&quot;He&#39;s quite the fan of Broadway plays,&quot; Integra
revealed as she sat the remote down, &quot;and as I don&#39;t
get out much he provides these for me.&quot;

&quot;So this is?&quot; Seres asked, watching Integra from the
corner of her eye. The suits that Integra wore hid her
curves and gave her a mannish look, doing her a great
disservice. In her pajama&#39;s the curve of hips and
breasts were visible, maybe too visible to Seres&#39;
gaze.

&quot;Wicked the Musical,&quot; Integra sounded smug, &quot;he
acquired a copy of their rehearsal DVD from the
director.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to see this,&quot; Seres laughed.

&quot;Me too.&quot; Integra grinned.

They listened and watched to it intently, both of them
clearly enjoying themselves as they sat on opposite
ends of the couch in Integra&#39;s suite. Finally they
came to the end and Seres sighed softly as she said,
&quot;Aww, that was nice.&quot;

&quot;A happy ending too,&quot; Integra said, a faint shine at
the corner of her eyes that in a lesser woman might
have been tears. Still, it was clearly impossible for
Integra to be crying at anything, so Seres pointedly
ignored it.

&quot;Did you have a favorite song?&quot; Seres asked curiously
as she sat curled up at the end of the comfortable
couch.

Integra looked thoughtful then she grinned impishly.
&quot;What is this feeling, I think,&quot; she admitted,
chuckling.

Seres chuckled softly as she thought of that scene,
&quot;That was a riot, wasn&#39;t it.&quot; She reached for the
remote, &quot;May I?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Integra nodded.

Seres rewound to the beginning of the part they wanted
then hit play. She sang the first bit in a passable
voice then Integra took up the next, each one fumbling
the words a bit but clearly enjoying themselves.

&quot;What is this feeling, so sudden and new?&quot; Seres sang,
looking at Integra.

Integra sang back throatily, &quot;I felt it the moment I
laid eyes on you.&quot;

&quot;My pulse is rushing,&quot; Seres sang.

Integra fought a grin, &quot;My head is reeling.&quot;

Innocently Seres cooed, &quot;My face is flushing.&quot;

&quot;What is this feeling?&quot; they chimed in together,
&quot;Fervid as a flame, does it have a name? Yes.
Loathing! Unadulterated Loathing!&quot;

Both women broke into giggles, unable to continue
through their laughter. &quot;Seres you&#39;re a bad girl,&quot;
Integra chuckled, &quot;why did I get to be Elphaba?&quot;

&quot;Well, other than the fact that Elphaba gets to make
the blonde joke?&quot; Seres asked her friend impishly.

Integra snickered softly, &quot;Besides that.&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re both strong, dynamic women who are
often misunderstood,&quot; Seres admitted reluctantly.

&quot;I&#39;m misunderstood?&quot; Integra raised a elegant eyebrow
questioningly as the story continued on behind them.

&quot;Would you let anyone besides Walter, Alucard and I
see you like this?&quot; Seres gestured to Integra&#39;s
pajamas and messy hair.

&quot;True,&quot; Integra conceded after a moment, &quot;though I
think it has more to do with maintaining command
distance.&quot;

&quot;I know how that feels,&quot; Seres agreed. In the
aftermath of the attack on Hellsing&#39;s headquarters she
had found herself thrust into a commanding role, one
she was unsure she was suited to. But inspired by
Integra&#39;s example she had tackled the job with
determination and was earning the respect of both her
subordinates and commanders.

Integra looked over at Seres, her silvery grey hair
falling around her face. &quot;You carry it off very well,&quot;
she noted, &quot;I think Pip is the only one who doesn&#39;t
buy it.&quot;

Seres rolled her blood red eyes, &quot;The man drives me
nuts.&quot;

&quot;He likes you,&quot; Integra noted, gracefully drawing her
legs up so that she could sit curled up on her side.

&quot;I was never into that when I was alive,&quot; Seres said
with a faint blush, looking away from Integra&#39;s
graceful curves.

Integra hesitated, feeling her pulse race a bit as a
forbidden thought took hold. &quot;Oh?&quot; she asked
leadingly, her expression kind.

Seres blushed, a remarkable sight on a vampire. &quot;I&#39;m
not,&quot; she said hesitantly, &quot;into boys at all,
honestly.&quot;

&quot;I did wonder,&quot; Integra said gently, &quot;how you could be
a virgin this day and age.&quot;

Seres looked deeply embarrassed, &quot;There are...
different kinds of virginity, I suppose. Most of what
my girlfriends did wouldn&#39;t cross that technical line,
but I was experienced.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Integra chuckled. She was also quite
experienced at deriving pleasure without losing one&#39;s
virginity, a requirement of the leader of Hellsing.
She looked over at Seres. &quot;Do you... never mind.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Seres asked, meeting her ice blue eyes
searchingly.

Integra hesitated a moment then took the plunge and
asked, &quot;What sort of women do you find attractive?&quot;
Silently she prayed that Seres went for taller women
in men&#39;s suits.

Seres blushed again, looking away cutely. &quot;It varies,&quot;
she admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t think I have a type, really.&quot;
She met Integra&#39;s eyes as she confessed, &quot;I haven&#39;t...
since Alucard changed me.&quot;

&quot;For that long?&quot; Integra looked at her in shock. She
thought she had pretty good control over herself, but
even she couldn&#39;t imagine going so long without.

&quot;I&#39;ve had,&quot; Seres flushed again, &quot;other things on my
mind.&quot;

&quot;And it&#39;s not like you&#39;ve had many opportunities,&quot;
Integra conceded, &quot;maybe I can arrange a few days
off...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not necessary,&quot; Seres laughed shyly.
&quot;Besides,&quot; she added in a rush, &quot;there&#39;s already
someone I&#39;m interested in.&quot;

Integra could almost feel her eyes turn green from
jealousy as she asked, &quot;A woman with the mercenaries
we hired?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Seres gave her a faintly exasperated look.

&quot;Oh,&quot; the thought finally hit Integra, &quot;Oh!&quot; A smile
tugged at her lips as she murmured, &quot;You little minx.&quot;

Seres titled her head to the side as she tentatively
asked, &quot;Is it all right?&quot;

&quot;Just thinking of the times you&#39;ve walked by in just a
towel after a shower and all of the other little
things you&#39;ve pulled to tease me,&quot; Integra said as she
shuffled down the couch to sit beside Seres.

Seres smiled shyly, &quot;I wanted you to notice me.&quot;

&quot;I did,&quot; Integra reached out to stroke Seres cheek
then cup her chin in her hand.

Seres leaned forward to brush Integra&#39;s lips with her
own, &quot;About time.&quot;

End

Note: I like the idea of Integra being a closet fan of
musicals, it&#39;s oddly perverse. The lyrics that they
sing are from Wicked the Musical, written by Stephen Schwartz.
