<h1>Through the Years: Awakening (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../hellsing/ttyawake-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>It only took a few minutes looking on for the realization sank into 
Chicago police detective Roy Coleman. He had followed Seras Victoria 
into the bedroom of Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent, for one to find out the state 
of his friend - but mostly to get one possible &#39;last look&#39; at her, in 
the case that the Draculina has to destroy Rally when she awoke as a 
vampire.

What he saw shocked even him. The normally-vibrant Rally just laid in 
bed, quiet as death. Her dusky skin unusually pale; Rally didn&#39;t seem to 
be breathing. &quot;This is something I never expected to see,&quot; he remarked.

&quot;What are you talking about, Detective?&quot; Seras asked, curious.

&quot;That I never expected to see Rally like this... like some corpse one 
usually finds in a morgue,&quot; Coleman said. &quot;For a long time, I&#39;ve dreaded 
the call that one day; she would&#39;ve gotten careless about a bounty and 
ended up on a slab.&quot; He looked further at Rally and added, &quot;At least she 
doesn&#39;t have the sutures from the autopsy to show for it.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about, Detective,&quot; Seras said, patting his 
shoulder. &quot;Soon, you can tell Rally about how you feel.&quot; She looked at 
the tray of blood chilling on ice that Walter C. Dolnez had brought up 
earlier, adding, &quot;Provided, that is, she doesn&#39;t go mad from the 
experience.&quot;

Coleman nodded, noting the rapidly-descending sun in the window. &quot;Do you 
know how hungry Rally would be once she does awaken?&quot; he asked.

The Draculina thought for a minute. &quot;Well... this is my experience about 
the whole thing... when it happened to me, it didn&#39;t hit me until I 
first saw the blood on ice. It felt like... I guess the best comparison 
would be like a cat going after a mouse. I was almost ravenous, wanting 
to utterly consume it then and there.&quot; Seras sighed as she added, &quot;It 
was then that I noticed my attitude and stopped myself from diving in. 
The whole thought of drinking blood disgusted me, so much that I 
endangered my well-being because of it. Master and Sir Integra would get 
on me, trying to get me to drink but to no avail. To me, it would&#39;ve 
meant surrendering the last of my humanity.&quot;

Coleman took this information in, trying to gauge Rally&#39;s reaction. He 
was about to ask Seras about the first time she drank blood when a sound 
caught his attention. Both he and the pretty vampire turned to the 
source of the sound - Rally&#39;s bed.

Rally was beginning to thrash around in her lifeless sleep. Her face, 
which originally looked peaceful, was now anguished, almost to the point 
of pain. Occasionally, she would mutter indecipherable words - and at 
one point cried-out. It was then that Coleman was shocked to see that 
fangs were now visible in her mouth.

&quot;She&#39;s starting to wake up,&quot; Seras said tursly. &quot;Detective, you had best 
leave now!&quot;

&quot;But what is...&quot; Coleman sputtered.

&quot;JUST DO IT!! LEAVE!!&quot; The expression on Seras&#39; face - a mixture of 
concern and warning - was enough for the detective to take it seriously! 
Rapidly, he made his way out of the bedroom, closing the door as he did. 
Seras, meanwhile, just stood in-between Rally and the tray of blood. She 
made sure that Alucard&#39;s Jackal gun, which was tucked into her belt 
behind her, was handy... just in case.

A group of concerned looks greeted Coleman as he quickly descended the 
stairs into the living room. Inside, Walter, Sir Integra Fairbrook 
Wingates Hellsing, and Becky &quot;the Nose&quot; Farrah, looked at the frantic 
detective. Only Alucard, who was leaning against the wall, did not share 
that look, the No-Life King instead looked bored - or was it silent 
worry.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Sir Integra demanded. &quot;We heard shouting!&quot;

&quot;Roy... is it Rally?&quot; Becky added.

Coleman took a couple of breaths before answering. &quot;Yes... she 
awakening.&quot;

A beat of silence came over the room. Becky broke it way saying 
nervously, &quot;S-so now what do we do?&quot;

&quot;The only thing we can do at this moment,&quot; Alucard said plainly, looking 
upstairs, &quot;we wait.&quot;

XXX

Seras could only look on helplessly as Rally appeared to be in a 
somewhat-restless sleep. Occasionally, Rally would groan as if in pain. 
Curious, the Draculina decided to look into her fledgling&#39;s mind, to 
find the reason for her distress. Almost immedietly, she could see, from 
a first-person vantage point, the events of the previous night - Rally&#39;s 
last night as a human.

&#39;It&#39;s as if she had dreamed the entire day,&#39; Seras thought sadly. &#39;It&#39;ll 
only add to her anguish... maybe even send her over the edge!&#39; 
Anxiously, she gripped the Jackal that was stuffed into her belt behind 
her. She certainly didn&#39;t wish she had to use it.

My god... what is this?

I should&#39;ve called Roy the minute I got the letter, telling him that 
bitch Goldie had nabbed May. Then maybe I wouldn&#39;t be in so much pain 
now. Instead, I&#39;m in the middle of a damn pile of rubble!

Right now, I&#39;m hearing voices above me. Heh, can&#39;t be angels, though, 
otherwise the pain would be gone right now.&#39;

&quot;RALLY!! ARE YOU ALRIGHT!!

&#39;Roy? Yeah I&#39;m... OH GOD, THE PAIN... I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE IT! PLEASE MAKE IT 
STOP!!&#39;

&quot;YES RALLY, ANSWER US, PLEASE!!&quot;

&#39;Yes Integra, I can hear you! Oh god, please give me the strength to 
reply!

I hear a scuffling above me. Please help me. What... what is that I 
hear?&#39;

&quot;I... I smell blood.&quot;

&quot;Yes, as well as I.&quot;

&#39;Blood? From me? No, that&#39;s not true! I&#39;ve got to tell them not so! 
There, I see light! I&#39;ve got to...&#39;

&quot;AAAAUUUGGGHHH!!&quot;

&quot;THERE... THERE SHE IS!!&quot;

&#39;Yes Roy, I&#39;m here!&#39;

&quot;ALUCARD, SERAS, GET THIS OFF HER!!&quot;

&#39;Finally, I see the full light! I&#39;ve got to reach out to them! I&#39;ve got 
to... AAAUUUGGHHH!! OH GOD, IT HURTS!!&#39;

&quot;WALTER, GET IN HERE NOW!!&quot;

&#39;Something&#39;s wrong... the pain&#39;s worse than what I had before.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s had medical training equal to your E.M.T. training! He should be 
able to assess her situation!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll call an ambulance!&quot;

&#39;I guess it&#39;s THAT bad, huh?&#39;

&quot;What are you doing? We&#39;ve got to save her!&quot;

&quot;It will all in vain, human. She will be dead before they arrive.&quot;

&#39;What? No, this is crazy, I can&#39;t be dying... not now... not with May in 
danger!&#39;

&quot;What are you talking about? She&#39;ll be dead if we don&#39;t get her out of 
here!&quot;

&quot;I am afraid Alucard is correct, Detective. I am not a doctor, but I&#39;ve 
had enough battlefield experience to know that Miss Vincent has suffered 
serious internal injuries. If we do call the ambulance, there is a good 
chance that she would die before they arrive at the hospital, if not 
when they arrive here.&quot;

&#39;No... no... no, it&#39;s not true!?&#39;

&quot;No... that can&#39;t be right.&quot;

&quot;Walter... is there any way...?&quot;

&quot;I am afraid not, Sir Integra. The best we can do for her is to try to 
make her comfortable... until the end comes.&quot;

&#39;NO, I&#39;M NOT GOING TO JUST LIE HERE AND DIE! WHAT ABOUT MAY? I&#39;VE GOT TO 
SAVE HER!! I...&#39;

&quot;AAAUUUGGGHHH!!&quot;

&quot;Miss Vincent... you shouldn&#39;t try to move in your condition.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Rally. You will only hurt yourself more.&quot;

&#39;To be frank Integra, I don&#39;t give a fuck about my comfort right now!&#39;

&quot;M...May... I&#39;ve... got... to save... May...&quot;

&quot;Rally... please don&#39;t worry... we&#39;ll get Goldie for you. I promise 
we&#39;ll make her pay for doing this to you.&quot;

&#39;Gosh... Roy sounds all choked-up. I must look worst that I feel!&#39;

&quot;That goes doubly for me, my friend. We will save May and bring Goldie 
to justice. Now you just lie there and...&quot;

&quot;NOOO!! Roy... Integra... Goldie wants me... nothing else. She... 
she&#39;s... libel to kill... May if I don&#39;t sh-sh-show up! Only I can... 
stop her... save May...&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re dying, Rally. There is no way you can be able to do that.&quot;

&#39;I hate to admit it... but I think Integra&#39;s right1 There&#39;s no way I can 
save May in my condition! But I can&#39;t just leave her to Goldie! Wait, 
maybe there&#39;s one way I CAN! But if I did, that would mean losing 
everything I ever have!&#39;

&quot;I... know of one... way... one way I can... save her.&quot;

&#39;I must be crazy to ever think about it! But at least Seras is within my 
vision.&#39;

&quot;One... way I know...&quot;

&quot;ARE YOU CRAZY, RALLY!?&quot;

&#39;I was thinking that same question, Roy.&#39;

&quot;YOU CAN&#39;T POSSIBLY WANT TO BECOME A VAMPIRE TO DO IT!!&quot;

&quot;AND I WILL NOT SANCTION IT! RALLY, YOU DESERVE TO LIVE AND DIE AS A 
HUMAN!! LET LIEUTENANT COLEMAN DO THIS!! I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD 
ACTUALLY...&quot;

&#39;Integra, for better-or-worse, it is MY decision, so stay out of it!&#39;

&quot;Master... it is not your place to say what Rally Vincent wishes.&quot;

&#39;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re in my corner, Alucard.&#39;

&quot;AND JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?&quot;

&quot;She has made her choice, my master. Are you going to deny your 
childhood friend&#39;s last request because of your own pride? Let her join 
the darkness. I sense she can be a very powerful ally of all in this 
world!&quot;

&quot;Integra... please...&quot;

&#39;I&#39;ll take my chances, Integra! Let me become a vampire and I&#39;ll show 
you what good I can do in this world! Just let me be able to save May 
first!&#39;

&quot;Very well... I cannot refuse Rally. You may proceed, Alucard.&quot;

&#39;WHAT!? HEY, NO WAY AM I GOING TO LET ALUCARD BE MY MASTER!!&#39;

&quot;I would be happy to... IF it were my place to.&quot;

&#39;What? Maybe he heard my thoughts!&#39;

&quot;Huh? What are you talking about, Master?&quot;

&quot;Rally Vincent IS your chosen prey, Seras. The honor should be yours.&quot;

&quot;You cannot be serious, Master? You&#39;re not asking me to make Rally into 
a vampire?&quot;

&quot;No, I am not. However, she IS. You better hurry, though... she doesn&#39;t 
have that much to live.&quot;

&#39;Yes, I am asking! No, it&#39;ll go better if I tell her.&#39;

&quot;Seras... please help me... save May.&quot;

&#39;She&#39;s scared. Come to think of it... I&#39;m scared, too. This is truly a 
first for me.&#39;

&quot;Yes Rally... I will.&quot;

&#39;Thank you. She&#39;s picking me up in her arms. I like the way it feels.&#39;

&quot;Are you certain this is what you want to do, Rally? Do you really want 
to become a vampire?&quot;

&quot;Not really... but I... have to save... May. So Seras... please...?&quot;

&#39;Oh god... I think I&#39;m fading! Everything&#39;s starting to get dark! 
Seras... hurry... before it&#39;s too late! Wait... Seras is kissing me.&#39;

&quot;Alright then.&quot;

&#39;Somehow that sounds good, her voice. I can feel Seras sinking her fangs 
into me, draining my blood. OH NO... THE DARKNESS IS GROWING, SWALLOWING 
ME UP!! SERAS, DON&#39;T LEAVE ME!! NO, DON&#39;T LEAVE ME...&#39;

XXX

&quot;NOOOOOO!!&quot; Rally sat bold-upright as she came around. Right away, Seras 
could see the evidence of her transformation. Rally&#39;s wide eyes, once a 
brilliant blue, was now a deep blood red, not to mention she could see 
the canine teeth enlarged.

Once gathering her bearings, Rally brought-up the covers and looked 
around. &quot;What the hell...?&quot; she muttered. &#39;I don&#39;t believe it... I&#39;m in 
my own bedroom,&#39; she thought to herself. &#39;Did I... dream the whole thing 
up?&#39;

&quot;Rally?&quot; Startled, Rally turned around, only to see the Draculina, 
looking concerned. Seras was also standing behind the containers of 
blood on the dresser.

&quot;Seras,&quot; breathed Rally, looking relieved. &quot;I didn&#39;t wake you up, did 
I?&quot;

&quot;No, I was up earlier,&quot; she lied. &quot;Anyway, how are you feeling?&quot; Seras 
asked.

&quot;Well now that you mentioned it,&quot; Rally began, &quot;I do feel a little 
funny, but otherwise alright. Anyway, I had this odd dream tonight, and 
in it I...&quot; It was at that moment that Seras stepped out of the way of 
the blood.

At the sight of the crimsom bags cooling on ice, Rally felt her throat 
seizing-up, as well as her thoughts blanking. She could only stare 
mindlessly at the blood as a new sensation took hold over her... one of 
ravenous hunger! Abruptly, she bolted out of bed, literally flying 
towards the bags on the dresser. Rapidly, she grabbed one of them and 
bit into it, draining the contents. Then just as that bag was empty, she 
immedietly grabbed the other bag and did the same. Once done, her 
nostrils twitched, catching a scent that was new to her... the scent of 
warm-bodied humans. Blankly eyeing the door, she started to make her way 
towards it.

&quot;Rally... stop!&quot; Seras called out, at the same time concentrating hard 
at her fledgling.

Rally stopped in her tracks, flinching at the sensation of an odd 
discomfort now seizing her insides. Then her mind finally clicked. 
&quot;Wha... wha... what just happened?&quot; she gasped. She then caught an odd 
taste in her mouth... a strange, metallic tang. Touching her lips, she 
looked in horror seeing smears of blood on the tips. With a mounting 
sense of dread, she moved her thumb into her mouth - and flinched when 
she felt it pricked by her sharp fangs.

&quot;What? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Desperately, Rally glanced over at the mirror 
to the right side of her - and was shocked to find she couldn&#39;t see her 
reflection! She felt her legs give way, collapsing to her knees. &quot;Oh 
god... no... no... no...no...&quot;, and so on, curling up in a fetal 
position and crying.

Cautiously, Seras crept over Rally, making sure the Jackal was handy. As 
she knelt down to her sobbing fledgling, she slowly reached behind her 
and grasped the gun with her right hand as she placed her left on 
Rally&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Rally,&quot; she began, feeling a lump in her throat, 
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry I done this to you.&quot;

For a few tense seconds Rally did nothing. Then slowly, she raised her 
head, the tracks of bloody tears evident on her face. &quot;No... there&#39;s 
nothing to apologize for. I asked for it, didn&#39;t I?&quot; she said. &quot;I was 
only hoping that... that everything that happened was just a dream. It&#39;s 
just... the whole situation... how I reacted... caught me off-guard, 
that&#39;s all.&quot;

Seeing that Rally was exhibiting a sense of lucidity, Seras relaxed her 
grip on the Jackal and hugged her. &quot;You&#39;ve frightened me, that&#39;s all. 
That look in your eye when you realized there was warm blood in the 
house... I had to do something.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t blame you. It was just that...&quot; All of a sudden, Rally paused 
as she returned the hug. Before Seras could stop her, Rally plucked the 
Jackal from the Draculina&#39;s belt.

&quot;Please Rally, you have to understand,&quot; Seras quietly pleaded, hoping 
the new vampire wasn&#39;t angry. &quot;It was in case you went mad as a result 
of your rising. You wouldn&#39;t want May to be unhappy if she heard you&#39;ve 
killed your friends.&quot;

Rally thought for a minute. &quot;I guess that I wouldn&#39;t blame you, Seras,&quot; 
she said, only to look down abruptly. &quot;No... I don&#39;t deserve to call you 
by your name anymore!&quot;

&quot;Rally... you don&#39;t have to...&quot; Seras sputtered, only to see Rally 
kneeling subserviently in front of her. Then she took the Draculina&#39;s 
right hand and placed it, backside up, against her forehead.

&quot;No, I have to... Master!&quot; Seras&#39; hand still against her forehead, Rally 
bowed her head down as she continued. &quot;You&#39;re my master now, just like 
you were to Alucard. I am yours to use and command... and I will do so 
until the end of time!&quot;

Seras could only look at Rally, still wondering how this normally 
independent woman could genuflect herself in front of her. Gently, she 
took her hand from Rally&#39;s forehead and kneeled down in front of her. 
&quot;It&#39;s alright, Rally,&quot; she began. &quot;I would rather you would call me by 
my name... but if you wish to call me &#39;Master&#39;, then I will not stop 
you.&quot;

Looking up, Rally smiled, seeing Seras&#39; face. &quot;Thanks... Master.&quot; Then a 
look of alarm came over her face. &quot;Omigod, I just remembered... May! 
Goldie still has her!&quot; Quickly, she got up from the floor and headed to 
the bedroom door.

&quot;RALLY, WAIT, YOU FORGOT SOMETHING!!&quot; Seras called out.

&quot;Master, what are you talking about, that bitch Goldie still has May 
and...&quot; It was then that Rally now noticed that she was naked. 
&quot;YEEEEEK!!&quot; Quickly, Rally collapsed on the floor and covered herself 
up. &quot;Master, what in the world happened to my clothes? Why the fuck am I 
stark naked!?&quot;

&quot;Sorry about that, Rally,&quot; Seras chuckled. &quot;I had to undress you in 
order to get you cleaned-up. Besides, your clothes were ruined from your 
experience under the rubble.&quot;

At first Rally said nothing, silently fuming over not having clothes. 
Then she smiled. &quot;I guess you didn&#39;t have any choice then, Master,&quot; she 
said, standing up. &quot;Still, this is all so frightening, me being a 
vampire. I hate to admit this... but if I&#39;m going to survive this, I&#39;m 
going to need a little help.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll get that help, Rally, both from me and Master Alucard,&quot; Seras 
replied, embracing her. &quot;And besides, Sir Integra may offer to help as 
well.&quot;

&quot;Oh... I don&#39;t suppose Integra&#39;s happy about this,&quot; Rally said glumly.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about her too much,&quot; said Seras, who drew Rally into a 
lingering kiss. &quot;She&#39;s the one that has to report to the Round Table 
about this. I think she&#39;ll need all the support from us she needs.&quot;

&quot;I guess.&quot; Rally then drew away from Seras. &quot;Look, I better get dressed. 
Master, could you tell the others I&#39;ll be down soon?&quot;

&quot;Of course, Rally.&quot; Seras then made her way to the door while Rally 
searched through the closet, tucking the Jackal again behind her. Then 
as an afterthought, she removed a slip of paper from one of her uniform 
pockets. &quot;I believe you may need this.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Alfie&#39;s directions!&quot; Rally said. &quot;Yes, I think I will be needing 
it.&quot; Seras simply nodded as she walked through the door. Blinking, the 
dusky vampire shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m going to have to ask her how she does 
that.&quot;

XXX

Seras was met by a group of concerned faces as she made her way down. 
&quot;Seras,&quot; Sir Integra began, &quot;how was it?&quot;

The Draculina first eyed Sir Integra, then looked at Alucard before 
returning her attention to her leader/love. &quot;It was a bit rocky at 
first,&quot; Seras began, &quot;but she was able maintain her composure, Sir 
Integra.&quot;

Sir Integra nodded, looking relieved. &quot;Thank God,&quot; she breathed, 
settling down in her chair, then again looking to the two vampires. &quot;I 
am going to have a lot to tell Sir Islands about this situation.&quot;

&quot;I trust the Round Table will not be too happy about another vampire 
walking the earth,&quot; Walter admitted.

&quot;And there is still Iscariot to contend with,&quot; Sir Integra added, her 
ice-blue eyes showing a worried look.

Seras took this in before walking up to Alucard, which she then handed 
the Jackal back to him. &quot;Thank you for allowing me to borrow this, 
Master. As you know, it wasn&#39;t necessary for me to use it.&quot;

&quot;But you were close to that, Seras,&quot; the red-clad vampire pointed out.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the Draculina added, nodding.

Another beat of silence before Coleman said, &quot;Well, at least this part 
is over, that&#39;s for certain.&quot;

&quot;I know, Roy,&quot; Becky added, &quot;but what about Rally&#39;s future?&quot;

Both Coleman and Becky looked at Sir Integra. &quot;That is a matter for 
another time,&quot; she said. &quot;Right now, the only concern is Miss Hopkins&#39; 
safety.&quot; Looking to Walter, she added, &quot;Is Rally&#39;s firearm with you.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Sir Integra,&quot; the butler said, going to a small box he had 
brought with him. Picking it up, Walter opened it to reveal Rally&#39;s 
CZ-75. &quot;Other than replacing the trigger spring with one more suited for 
a vampire&#39;s strength, all I ever did was clean it. I noticed too that 
Miss Vincent has this... unusual quirk of loading it with extremely 
powerful ammunition, possibly taking into account the gun&#39;s robust 
construction. I took the liberty of providing similar ammunition as 
well.&quot;

&quot;I am certain Rally will appreciate your generosity, Walter,&quot; Sir 
Integra put in. &quot;Now, all we have to do is wait for her to greet us.&quot; 
Coleman and Becky nodded, nervously looking up the landing.

By now, Rally was able to find a clean bra and panties and put them on 
before turning to the closet. She chose what she needed in the situation 
she was about the face: a white long-sleeved turtleneck blouse, stretch 
pants, boots and her favorite leather jacket. At least she knew May 
wouldn&#39;t complain about this choice.

However, when she turned to face the mirror, Rally was once again 
unnerved at not seeing her reflection. &quot;This&#39;ll take some time to get 
used to,&quot; she muttered to herself. Then her shoulders sagged. &quot;Oh May,&quot; 
she sighed sadly, &quot;how in the world am I going to explain this to you?&quot;
