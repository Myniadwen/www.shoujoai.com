<h1>Night Angels (part 24 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../hellsing/niteangel-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Moria Hedgley had found herself wandering within the confines of a dark 
forest. She knew not why or how she found herself in such a situation, 
only just she was there. She was also stark naked, but for some 
unforeseen reason, she didn&#39;t find this strange, nor she found it 
uncomfortable. For some strange compulsion, she made her way through the 
tangled underbrush, her bare feet somehow not harmed by the branches on 
the ground.

For about almost a minute of this moving about, Moria soon broke into a 
clearing, a silvery full moon illuminating the night skies. She found 
herself captivated at the sight of the moon, her heart quickening as she 
watched the sight - and soon found herself wanting to touch it with her 
hands.

She quickly broke into a sprint, her lithe body not caring about the 
discomfort the rushing air had on her bare skin. But no matter how fast 
she would run, the moon was still very far from Moria&#39;s grasp. Somehow, 
she found the strength to run faster - and faster still. And as she ran, 
a transformation came over her: fur had grown over her, insulating Moria 
from the cold. Her senses became sharper; the darkness seemed to be like 
the noonday sun to her. At the same time, she found herself racing on 
all fours, the speed she achieved fantastic.

When at last fatigue taken grip of her, Moria skidded to a stop near a 
small pond. A great thirst had overcome her, and she walked over to it, 
lapping at the water. However, when she realized what was happening, she 
stopped drinking and allowed the waters to still. What she saw horrified 
her. Instead of the beautiful, green-eyed brunette face she was used, 
what greeted her was a canine face - a wolf&#39;s specifically. Stumbling 
backwards on her hind legs, Moria screamed in anguish.

All that was heard was a mournful wolf&#39;s howl.

&quot;NOOOOOOOO&quot;

WHONK!!

&quot;OW!!&quot; Moria has slumped back onto the coffin/bed she shared with Irene 
&quot;Rally&quot; Vincent and Seras Victoria, her hand going to the sore spot on 
her forehead, caused by her hitting the lid. &quot;Bloody hell!&quot; she quietly 
grumbled, &quot;That&#39;s the price one pays for sleeping in a damned coffin!&quot;

Chuckling afterwards, she edged herself closer to the sleeping Rally, 
her bare breasts tightly squeezing against the dusky vampire&#39;s naked 
back. &quot;How envious am I about you, my lovely,&quot; she whispered into 
Rally&#39;s ear. &quot;A vampire like you only has to wait until the sun rises 
and you drop-off like a stone. I, on the other hand, have to struggle 
just to get sleepy enough to slip into the realm of dreams.&quot; Moria then 
pressed her head against Rally&#39;s. &quot;I just wish your cold, dead body had 
a heartbeat to lull me to sleep.&quot; But then, her thoughts returned to the 
strange dream. &quot;How odd, though,&quot; she further whispered. &quot;Why in the 
world would I dream of being a wolf?&quot;

Then the bedside phone rang, its electronic ring annoying Moria. &quot;Oh 
what is it now?&quot; she grumbled, taking a glimpse at the small clock on 
the lid. Pressing the light, she saw it was 11:54 AM. &quot;Somebody&#39;s going 
to hear it for getting me up this late!&quot; she growled. Opening the lid 
slightly, she groped around in the darkness until she grabbed the 
receiver. &quot;Yes?&quot; she sighed irritably.

&quot;Oh, I do apologize for rousing you at this hour,&quot; the voice of Walter 
C. Dolnez replied politely. &quot;Anyway, there is someone who wishes to 
speak to you, Miss Hedgley.&quot;

Moria let out a discouraged groan. &quot;Could you tell whoever it is I&#39;m 
sleeping, Mr. Dolnez?&quot; she muttered.

&quot;Well I am not so certain about it,&quot; the butler replied. &quot;He is very 
insistent about contacting you.&quot;

&quot;Very well, patch him through.&quot; While Walter was connecting the call, 
Moria thought to herself, &#39;It has to be some bloody telephone 
salesperson hoping to sell me some useless trinket! Oh how I am going to 
give him a piece of my mind once the call connects!&#39; Once the call was 
placed, she began with, &quot;Whatever it is you&#39;re bloody selling, I&#39;m not 
buying!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s funny, I don&#39;t happen to be selling anything, Moria!&quot; a cheerful 
male voice replied.

Remembering the lid, Moria raised it before sitting up, surprised. 
&quot;Father?&quot; she gasped, turning on the room&#39;s lights.

&quot;Yes, it is me,&quot; the voice of Kenneth Hedgley said. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I got 
you up this late, Moria dear. Walter did say you were now sleeping 
days.&quot;

&quot;Uh... yes, I am, Father,&quot; Moria stammered. &#39;I can&#39;t believe it... 
talking on the phone with my father stark naked!&#39; she thought. &#39;How 
embarrassing can this be?&#39; Gathering her wits, she said, &quot;So... what do 
you need?&quot;

&quot;Oh nothing, Dear. I just called to let you know that I&#39;m in the city 
and will be seeing you around your birthday,&quot; Kenneth said. &quot;I still 
have to find a motel, but I wanted to ring you up to say &#39;hi&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Uh... yes,&quot; Moria sighed. &quot;Oh no,&quot; she then groaned.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Kenneth asked.

&quot;I forgot to deposit the money order you sent me!&quot; Moria said. &quot;Tonight 
was pretty wicked, and with all the excitement...&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry if I were you. I know there is plenty of time to get 
to the bank.&quot; There was a beat of quiet over the line before Kenneth 
quipped up, &quot;What&#39;s the matter, dear? You seem a bit subdued, something 
I didn&#39;t expect.&quot; Another few seconds of quiet before, &quot;I was 
wondering... did you find a girlfriend?&quot;

Moria froze. &quot;Y-yes,&quot; she said in a quiet voice. &quot;In fact... I have two. 
Do you feel... disappointed in me?&quot;

&quot;Why no, Moria, dear,&quot; her father said. &quot;Granted, I was a little 
surprised when I heard you were a lesbian, but it doesn&#39;t mean I love 
you even less.&quot; He then laughed, &quot;I just didn&#39;t expect you would have a 
harem, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;FATHER, IT&#39;S NOT LIKE THAT!!&quot; Moria gasped, shocked at what her father 
said.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Moria,&quot; Kenneth replied, chuckling, &quot;As long as you&#39;re 
happy, then I&#39;m happy! So, how long will it be before I meet the lucky 
girls?&quot;

Relieved, Moria turned to face the mirror on the vanity, saying, &quot;As 
soon as you can arrange a visit. But they may be not what you expect. 
You see...&quot; But then she dropped the receiver, gasping in surprise.

&quot;Moria? Moria, is something wrong? Moria?&quot; Kenneth said.

Moira didn&#39;t answer, instead staring in horror at her image in the 
mirror. Her emerald green eyes were changed into a bluish white, and 
when she gasped, she noticed her canine teeth were enlarged.

A FEW MINUTES PRIOR, IN AN UNKNOWN LANDSCAPE...

&quot;Oh brother, I know what this means,&quot; Rally mumbled as she wandered 
around the foggy scene around her. &quot;Master needed to talk to me in 
private while I&#39;m asleep, so she pulled me again into this dreamscape 
she came up with.&quot; This sort of thing annoyed the dusky vampire. 
Granted, her dreams since she became a vampire were unusually vibrant - 
which included her awareness in the real world - but not so much as this 
fantasy scene of London in the late 1800&#39;s at night.

Of course, she also knew about her current state of affairs because it 
was the only time she was ever dressed in an identical version of Seras&#39; 
yellow Hellsing uniform. Rally took a little time to examine herself in 
this getup, replying, &quot;But I have to admit, at least I look good in 
this, that&#39;s for certain. But I wonder why Master always does this?&quot;

&quot;What else do you want me to dress you in?&quot; the Draculina chuckled as 
she walked from the fog, dressed in an identical Hellsing uniform, but 
in her old blue color. &quot;I could have you in a sport bra and those 
panties I bought you that you won&#39;t wear.&quot;

&quot;Er... we&#39;ll talk about those panties later, okay Master?&quot; Rally 
sputtered, blushing.

&quot;Agreed,&quot; Seras said, directing Rally to a park bench. &quot;Right now, 
there&#39;s something important I need to talk to you about.&quot;

Rally studied the face of her master. It looked serious. &quot;Okay, what 
about?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s concerning Moria.&quot; Noting the surprise in Rally&#39;s face, Seras 
added, &quot;I was wondering... have you noticed if her blood tasted 
different, compared with other humans?&quot;

&quot;Now that you&#39;ve mentioned it, Master,&quot; Rally began, &quot;I noted there was 
something a little different about her blood. I mean, it doesn&#39;t taste 
any different than any human or FREAK I&#39;ve consumed. But after drinking 
it... I somehow feel a little more energized afterwards, like it had 
some power in it.&quot; Suddenly, an alarmed look came over the dusky 
vampire&#39;s face. &quot;Master,&quot; she said, &quot;why all this about Moria? Is there 
something wrong with her... something I should know about?&quot;

&quot;Rally,&quot; Seras said, looking sad, &quot;I&#39;m not sure how to say this, but 
after you and Moria had left the office, I had to tell Sir Integra about 
something I saw when Moria fought the ghoul. I learned from her that...&quot;

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot;

Both vampires turn in alarm. &quot;THAT&#39;S MORIA!!&quot; Rally called out as she 
faded from view. Reluctantly, Seras followed her.

XXX

Rally and Seras awoke to find the lid of the coffin/bed open, as well as 
the room&#39;s light on. Turning to one side, Rally found Moira looking at 
the mirror, trembling. &quot;Moria! What&#39;s wrong?&quot; the dusky vampire called 
out.

Nothing could prepare Rally for what she saw next. When Moria turned, 
she was alarmed to see that the maid&#39;s eyes were transformed; bluish 
white instead of green, as well as fangs. &quot;M-Moria?&quot; Rally sputtered. 
&quot;W-what&#39;s happened to you?&quot; Overwhelmed by the many shocks to her 
system, all Moria did was turn-up her eyes and collapsed in a faint.

Quickly, Rally raced to Moria&#39;s side, immedietly cradling the maid. As 
Seras got up, she noticed the phone&#39;s receiver on the floor. &quot;MORIA, 
WHAT&#39;S HAPPENED? MORIA!?&quot; a voice shouted out.

Picking up the receiver, the Draculina answered, &quot;Who is this?&quot;

&quot;Kenneth Hedgley, Moria&#39;s father!&quot; came the terse reply. &quot;What in the 
world has happened to my daughter?&quot;

&quot;Listen, are you in the city?&quot; Seras asked.

&quot;Yes!&quot;

&quot;Please, find you way to the Hellsing Mansion!&quot; the Draculina tursly 
said. &quot;I have a feeling she&#39;s going to need your help, Mr. Hedgley!&quot;

&quot;Will do... and thanks!&quot; The line closed.

In the meantime, Rally had found robes and had dressed Moria in one of 
them, then taking one for her and giving Seras the other. She once again 
cradled Moria, who was recovering from her swoon. &quot;R-Rally,&quot; she weakly 
asked, her eyes and teeth still transformed, &quot;what has happened to me?&quot;

&quot;I wish I knew, Moria,&quot; replied Rally, hugging the maid closely.

XXX

It was a few minutes later that Moria found herself being examined on a 
makeshift examination table. Herself, Rally and Seras had taken the time 
to get themselves dressed while Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing 
had contacted Dr. Trevelyan, Sir Integra&#39;s personal doctor, who was at 
that moment examining the girl. Standing away from the two, Sir Integra, 
Rally, Seras, as well as Alucard, Walter, and Pip Bernadotte, could only 
watch. &quot;Well, what have you found, Doctor?&quot; the Hellsing leader asked.

&quot;One moment, please?&quot; Dr. Trevelyan asked, the brown-haired physician 
using an instrument to examine Moira&#39;s eyes. He then placed a cuff on 
her left arm and took her blood pressure.

As the doctor was making his examination, Seras glanced over to Rally 
and noticed her apprentice had a worried look on her face. &#39;Moria seems 
to be in good hands, Rally,&#39; she said telepathically, &#39;so I wouldn&#39;t 
fuss too much.&#39;

&#39;But still Master,&#39; the dusky vampire replied, &#39;it&#39;s still possible my 
initial bite to her might have done something. I just can&#39;t help but be 
worried.&#39;

&#39;I don&#39;t believe you done anything that she already had, Rally,&#39; Seras 
added. Rally just looked at her master oddly, wondering what exactly she 
meant.

After a few minutes, Dr. Trevelyan completed his examination. &quot;So far, 
she hasn&#39;t changed much since the last time I examined her,&quot; he began, 
&quot;breathing, heartbeat, physical response all normal. Her blood pressure 
is elevated, though but that&#39;s understandable, considering the amount of 
stress Miss Hedgley is currently under. However, as for her eye color 
and the appearance of fangs, well... I&#39;m sorry, Sir Integra but I&#39;m 
completely at a loss to explain it.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps an explanation will be forthcoming, Doctor,&quot; Sir Integra said, 
noticing Walter going to answer the phone. &quot;You have my thanks, though, 
for coming in such short notice.&quot;

&quot;You do know something, do you Sir Integra?&quot; Moria gasped, taking in her 
employer&#39;s words. &quot;Please I beg of you, if you have any information on 
what has happened to me, I must know it!&quot;

Before the Hellsing leader could answer, Walter had returned to the 
group. &quot;Pardon me for interrupting,&quot; he began, &quot;but Miss Hedgley&#39;s 
father has arrived at the front gate. I have already told the guards to 
let the taxi inside. Now if you will all excuse me, I must be there to 
greet him.&quot;

&quot;You may do so, Walter,&quot; Sir Integra replied, then returned her 
attention to the worried maid. &quot;As for your request Moira, I do have it 
but I believe it would be best if your father explain the situation to 
you.&quot;

&quot;Father&#39;s here?&quot; Moria asked.

&quot;I requested that he come after you fainted, Moira,&quot; Seras explained.

Moria nodded. &quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; she said.

It was a few second before Kenneth entered the parlor where Moria was 
examined. However, both Rally and Seras were... to be honest... a little 
surprised at what they saw as the man entered. &#39;That&#39;s her father?&#39; 
Rally thought.

Seras nodded in agreement. &#39;He looks like her older brother!&#39; she added.

Indeed Kenneth looked younger that alluded to; black-haired, 
green-eyed... and looking like he was at least 25 or younger! &quot;Moria,&quot; 
he said, hugging his daughter, &quot;are you alright?&quot;

&quot;Yes I am,&quot; Moira replied. &quot;Father, what&#39;s going on? I woke up with 
these fangs in my mouth, as well as my eyes in a different colour than 
normal! Please tell me, what is happening to me?&quot;

Kenneth took a little time before answering. &quot;Forgive me, dear,&quot; he 
began, &quot;but I was hoping you would be able to avoid this... but now it 
looks like there&#39;s no choice now.&quot;

For the next few minutes, after sitting his daughter down, Kenneth then 
began to relate the story about what was happening to her. At first, 
Moria seemed to be calm - until they got down to the details of what was 
transpiring. &quot;N-no, that cannot be true!&quot; Moria gasped, recoiling in 
horror. &quot;I cannot be transforming into a werewolf! It cannot be true!!&quot;

Kenneth looked a little downcast, understanding his daughter&#39;s reaction. 
&quot;I wish it wasn&#39;t... women of our clan don&#39;t usually inherit the curse I 
now have. I was hoping that you would grow up normal, without dreading 
for the future. That was why I and your mother didn&#39;t tell this to you.&quot;

&quot;But how can you be so calm about it, Father?&quot; Moria shot back, a tone 
of anger in her voice. &quot;I&#39;m turning into some sort of monster! This is 
the sort of thing the organization is trying to avoid!&quot;

&quot;Moria,&quot; Sir Integra added, holding an envelope in her hand, &quot;perhaps 
this might help a bit. Your grandfather thought long and hard about how 
he would tell you what is happening right now.&quot; She handed the envelope 
to Moria, who was on the verge of crying. &quot;I never saw the contents of 
this, but if it might help, I would appreciate if you take the time and 
read this.&quot;

Moira looked up, tears streaming from her eyes. &quot;I... I guess.&quot; Taking 
the envelope, she got up from the chair. &quot;Now if you all will excuse 
me,&quot; she said, her voice breaking, &quot;I would like to be alone for a bit.&quot; 
She then ran out of the parlor and headed down the basement stairs.

Seeing the look on the maid&#39;s face, Rally started going after her, only 
to be restrained by Seras. &#39;Let her be, Rally,&#39; she said mentally. 
&#39;Believe me, I want to do the same thing you want to do. But in her 
state of mind right now, it might be too dangerous.&#39;

&#39;I... I guess you&#39;re right, Master,&#39; Rally replied, &#39;but I feel so bad 
for her. So, what&#39;s next?&#39;

&#39;I think we&#39;ll let Moria take that step,&#39; the Draculina answered. Rally 
nodded.

In the meantime, Walter could only place a hand on Kenneth&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;I would give her a little time, Mr. Hedgley,&quot; he said. &quot;Who knows - she 
might turn out for the better as a result of this.&quot;

&quot;I hope so, Walter,&quot; Kenneth replied sadly. &quot;I hope so.&quot;

Walter noticed the dour mood the man was in. He patted him on the 
shoulder and added, &quot;I would cheer up if I were you. Should Miss Hedgley 
come around, it would not do her any good to see you in a melancholy 
mood.&quot; He then left, saying, &quot;I will ask Sir Integra if I would see to 
your accommodations here.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; But all Kenneth could do is look down the stairs his 
daughter fled to.

XXX

As for Moria, she had barricaded herself in the room she shared with 
Rally and Seras, sobbing openly and heavily as she laid on the bed. For 
about four more minutes, she continued to cry, then sat herself up and 
sobered-up. &quot;How am I going to cope with this? I don&#39;t want to become a 
monster!&quot; she sniffled, finding a box of tissues. She blew her nose, 
then got another tissue and dried her eyes. Looking up, she had found 
that her eyes had reverted to their normal hue, only now bloodshot and 
puffy from her crying. &quot;At least they&#39;re more-or-less normal,&quot; she said.

Getting up from the bed, she wandered over to the table in the middle of 
the room, where Moira had dropped the envelope Sir Integra gave her. &quot;At 
least I should get a look at this,&quot; she sighed. Slowly, she opened the 
envelope, then produced the letter inside. It took a little while for 
her eyes to adjust; they were still red, but soon the hand-written words 
finally came into focus:

Moria,

If you happen to be reading this, then it is apparent that what myself, 
your mother and father had dreaded has happened. I can only imagine the 
thoughts you are experiencing right now: fear, anger and betrayal. Of 
that, I can understand. But before you begin to post blame on your 
situation, please read what I have to say first.

I have only known your father for a very short time, but from what I saw 
of him, not only from his abilities but his actions, that your father is 
possibly one of the bravest men I have ever seen, aside from Walter. His 
loyalty to the church and crown is unquestioned, and has used his curse 
only for the safeguarding of England from the forces of darkness. That 
is the nature of the werewolf clan that he belonged to.

That was partly the reason he was not present at your mother&#39;s funeral; 
by the time he heard of her death, he was already on a mission and by 
the time he found of her death, she was already buried. He desperately 
wanted to tell you immediately what might happen to you. But try as he 
might, he could not bring himself to say the words. Of that, I am 
certain he is sorry. But you should not worry about your curse. Your 
father told me that those afflicted are in complete control of their 
transformations, provided an unnecessary shock to their emotions does 
not occur. In fact, the person can choose how transformed they can be, 
and retain all sense of human intellect and moral obligation and are not 
taken to becoming wanton killers.

Moria, I realize you may be angry with your father for not telling you, 
but if he&#39;s still alive at the time you&#39;re reading this, please listen 
to him. He can show you how to use your power to its best advantage, 
without harming any innocents. I know you&#39;re not exactly the soldier 
type, but I believe with all my heart you can be one of the Hellsing 
Organization&#39;s best fighters, along with Alucard and Seras, in the 
battle against darkness.

Don&#39;t give up, Moria. I love you and have complete faith in you.

All my love,

Your grandfather Peter Farguson.

&quot;Grandfather,&quot; Moria said, smiling, &quot;you may be a bit long-winded in 
your all-too patriotic speeches... but at least you know how to make me 
feel better.&quot; Leaning back in her chair, she thought for a bit. &quot;Alright 
Moria,&quot; she said to herself wryly, &quot;so you&#39;re a werewolf. And granted 
Father was a bit neglectful about telling you the truth. But I DO love 
him dearly... and if I&#39;m going to get through this crisis, I&#39;m going to 
need his help more than ever!&quot; Standing up, she straightened herself up, 
then found a new blouse that wasn&#39;t tear-stained, and after dressing 
made her way out the door.

XXX

Kenneth had returned to the parlor, sitting morosely by himself as he 
waited for his daughter&#39;s hopeful return. &quot;I should have told her 
sooner,&quot; he muttered as he took a deck of cards out of his coat and 
proceeded to play a game of solitaire on a nearby table. It was a habit 
of his, something to do whenever the stresses of his chosen profession - 
a freelance fighter of darkness - get the best of him.

&quot;Father?&quot;

Kenneth turned around. Moria was standing at the landing from the 
sub-basement level. All of a sudden, she lunged herself into his arms, 
crying as she did. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I was angry at you!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;I 
read Grandfather&#39;s letter, and he made it clear you didn&#39;t meant any 
harm! Please forgive me?&quot;

&quot;Moria dear, I was never angry at you,&quot; Kenneth reassured, hugging his 
daughter. &quot;I was hoping that you were the one to forgive me for not 
telling you sooner.&quot;

Moria then looked into her father&#39;s eyes as she said, &quot;Grandfather said 
you only found out about Mum&#39;s death and funeral when it was too late. I 
can excuse that.&quot; She then dried her eyes and added, &quot;However, if I am 
going to get through this, I&#39;m going to need your help more than ever! 
Will you please stay with me during this?&quot;

&quot;Moria dear that was why I contacted you. If I found that you had indeed 
inherited my curse, which you have, then I intended to help you through 
the days to come.&quot; Kenneth placed his right arm over her shoulder as he 
added, &quot;But you&#39;re stronger than you give yourself credit for, so I 
wouldn&#39;t worry too much.&quot; He then guided her to a mirror in the hallway, 
&quot;So now that I&#39;m here, why don&#39;t we start with a small lesson, mostly 
about the lesser stages of your transformation.&quot;

&quot;So why are we headed to this mirror?&quot; Moira asked, looking at her 
reflection.&quot;

&quot;Try to imagine the sight you saw when I called you this afternoon,&quot; 
Kenneth said.

&quot;But why?&quot; Moria asked.

&quot;Just try, dear, and you&#39;ll see,&quot; was all Kenneth said.

Sighing, Moria simply looked into the mirror, thinking about the 
incident when she woke up. Quite suddenly, though, she saw her eyes 
transform from green to white. Gasping, she also saw her canines 
lengthening to their wolf-like appearance. &quot;I... I did it!&quot; she 
exclaimed, surprised. Excited, Moria turned to face Kenneth - and was 
equally surprised to see him with the same appearance.

&quot;Yes you did,&quot; Kenneth replied, smiling. &quot;You can transform your form 
anytime you wish. Of course, for these first transformations, we&#39;re 
going to have to approach these slowly. Now, what I want you to do is to 
try to go one step further.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; Clearing her mind, Moria decided to visualize this next part 
by imagining herself as an infant taking her first steps. &#39;After all,&#39; 
she mused, &#39;I am, in a way, a baby at this.&#39; Bracing, she conditioned 
herself as, in her mind, she took that step.

All of a sudden, she gasped as something took hold of her. Looking at 
the mirror, Moria found that, although she was basically the same 
appearance, she had changed! Her face was a little less rounded, her 
features now more angular. Fighting for breath, she parted her hair away 
and saw that the lobes of her ears were slightly pointed, almost like a 
wolf&#39;s. She also found that her senses had sharpened greatly; she could 
hear the heartbeats of almost everyone in the mansion, as well as 
smelling scents she was never accustomed to. Looking at her arm, she 
found it a bit more muscular that before. &quot;I...&quot; she found out that 
forming words was a little more difficult that before, &quot;...I look like a 
bloody bodybuilder! And what I smell... I hope the lady doesn&#39;t think 
I&#39;m slacking off!&quot;

There was also something else she noticed... something almost feral 
about her. &quot;Father... all of a sudden... I feel like going outside and 
try to kill a rabbit! This is frightening! I&#39;ve never had these thoughts 
before!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just the hunter&#39;s instincts in your new form talking, Moria,&quot; 
Kenneth reassured, hugging his daughter. &quot;It&#39;s nothing but you should 
try to fight it. I suggest you try to go about for a few days until you 
get used to the sensations.&quot;

&quot;I hope so, Father,&quot; Moria said, leaning closer. &quot;I just hope the rest 
of the staff can get used to this new look of me.&quot;

&quot;You still look the same to me, Moria,&quot; a new voice smirked.

Surprised, Moria spun around, the look on her face showing the readiness 
to attack - only to stop to see Rally standing behind the two. &quot;Hey 
Moria, take it easy!&quot; the dusky vampire assured, holding her hand up in 
defense.

Relaxing her stance, Moria then thrust herself into Rally&#39;s embrace. 
&quot;You fool!&quot; she said, almost sobbing. &quot;I almost attacked you!&quot;

&quot;Look, it&#39;s alright,&quot; Rally said gently, rubbing Moria&#39;s back. &quot;Anyway, 
I&#39;m glad you and your dad were able to get back together.&quot; She then 
pulled Moria back and looked at her new appearance, &quot;And from the looks 
of it, you&#39;ve got a few improvements now! Listen, if you need me to, I 
can stay back for a few days, until you get used to all this.&quot;

&quot;No, that&#39;s alright,&quot; Moria said, again embracing Rally. &quot;You just 
surprised me, that&#39;s all. Anyway, I&#39;m happy you like this. At least I 
can be more of a help to you and Seras now.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Rally said. She then noticed Kenneth, who had a bemused smile 
on his face. Looking down, she whispered, &quot;Listen, about your father... 
me and Master noticed that he looks... well... a bit young. Are you 
certain he isn&#39;t your older brother?&quot;

&quot;Well of course he is, you silly!&quot; Moria laughed, playfully slapping 
Rally. &quot;Don&#39;t be teasing.&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay, don&#39;t get upset with me,&quot; Rally replied, also laughing. 
Looking at Kenneth, she added, &quot;Look, I got some word from Sir Integra. 
She said that she&#39;ll have Walter set you up in one of the rooms here. 
She told me that you will be staying for a few days, until Moria gets 
used to all this.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Kenneth mused. &quot;Well, give Sir Integra my thanks, Miss...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Rally Vincent,&quot; Rally answered. &quot;I&#39;ll tell Sir Integra the good 
news.&quot; Walking away, she said, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Kenneth said, waving at the dusky vampire. Then 
returning his attention to his daughter, he added, &quot;I would guess that 
she&#39;s one of your girlfriends? I must admit, I find it surprising that 
you would be attracted to a vampire, more-or-less two, if I read her 
words correctly. But I have to admit... I like her. You two do make a 
good couple.&quot;

Moria took a few seconds of thinking before saying, &quot;She does have one 
point though.&quot; Looking her father straight in the eye, she added, &quot;You 
DO look extremely well-preserved for someone who&#39;s supposed to be at 
least 45. Is there something else I should know?&quot;

&quot;I guess I can&#39;t hide that part for too long,&quot; Kenneth replied. &quot;Very 
well, no beating around the bush there.&quot; He then guided his daughter to 
a chair in the hallway. He took the other chair and continued with, &quot;It 
is a strange thing, our species. We&#39;re mortal, like any human. However, 
we do have an... extraordinary regenerative ability. Any injury we incur 
is able to be healed almost instantly... except for silver weapons, 
though. Then it&#39;s just about normal until the silver is removed. And 
that regenerative power also extends to the otherwise normal 
deterioration the human body suffers as part of the ageing cycle.&quot;

Moira drew in a breath slowly, her eyes wide. &quot;Father,&quot; she finally 
said, &quot;you... you don&#39;t mean...&quot;

Kenneth nodded. &quot;We age very slowly, almost inperceptively. It takes 
someone who has known us for very long even to notice the change... and 
someone with good eyes like your friend Rally.&quot; He then placed his hands 
on Moria&#39;s shoulders as he added, &quot;I&#39;m over 450 years old, Moria. I&#39;ve 
known Prince Dracula, who you know now as Alucard, since the time he 
ruled over Walachia and guarded that kingdom from the Ottomans, as well 
his fall as a vampire.&quot;

It was fortunate that Moria was sitting down when Kenneth told her this, 
for at that moment she felt faint. Thinking fast, she set her head 
against her legs until she felt her strength coming back. &quot;My god,&quot; she 
whispered, &quot;to think that you... endured all these years... did Mum and 
Grandfather know about this?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t tell your grandfather about this,&quot; Kenneth replied, &quot;although 
I did tell your mother. Her reaction was just about the same as yours.&quot; 
He then hugged his daughter and added, &quot;I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;ve given that 
burden to you as well.&quot;

Moria returned his hug. &quot;That&#39;s alright, Father,&quot; she said. &quot;Granted, it 
was a bit of a shock, but at least I know ahead of time.&quot;

&quot;But I must remind you,&quot; Kenneth added, &quot;Although we are long-lived, we 
are NOT immortal. I&#39;ve seen many of our clan die as a result of those 
ignorant of our true natures. You WILL death eventually, but only as a 
result of a silver weapon.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Moria then stood up. &quot;Father, if you don&#39;t mind, I would like to 
return to bed. This is a lot to digest, but I sincerely hope you&#39;ll see 
me through this.&quot;

&quot;I intend to,&quot; her father said. &quot;We just need to make sure we get to 
your final transformation before your 20th birthday, the first night of 
the full moon, where we have our greatest power.&quot;

&quot;Why is that?&quot;

&quot;Because a first transformation on that night is the most chaotic,&quot; 
Kenneth warned. &quot;On that night, a transformation cannot be controlled, 
and those unprepared for that run the risk of going mad as a result.&quot; He 
hugged Moira as he added, &quot;You and I are the last of our clan, and I 
would dread to have you killed because of it.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry, Father,&quot; Moria said softly. &quot;As long as you are here, 
I&#39;m certain I will prevail.&quot;

SIR INTEGRA&#39;S OFFICE...

Walter had gotten off the phone just as Rally had left the office. Sir 
Integra then turned her attention to the old butler and said, &quot;Rally has 
told me that Moira has accepted her condition, not to mention forgiving 
her father for not telling her, and that Kenneth is going to help her 
through her transformation for the next few days. At least that is one 
crisis averted.&quot;

&quot;I had already seen to Mr. Hedgley&#39;s accommodations for a few day, Sir 
Integra,&quot; Walter said. &quot;Also, I had just finished talking to Sir 
Townstead. Scotland Yard&#39;s forensic teams had finished examining Stanley 
Hardwicke&#39;s motor car and he has informed me that he will have the 
vehicle transferred here tomorrow night.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Sir Integra said, going to her laptop, &quot;at least we can now 
concentrate on the current crisis at hand, namely the possible FREAK 
within the Royal Rockets&#39; ranks.&quot;

&quot;Indeed.&quot; Walter then noticed the site Sir Integra was viewing. &quot;Going 
over the automotive event that is happening next week, I see.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I was looking over the participants expected to attend.&quot; The 
Hellsing leader ran through the list, commenting, &quot;From what I see, 
entrants from all over the world are converging into this city. I never 
expected it would be THIS popular.&quot; Then one name caught her attention. 
&quot;Now that is strange! Walter, take a look at this participant. Tell me 
what you think.&quot;

Walter bent over and looked at the name. The monocle on his left eye 
nearly dropped as he saw it. &quot;I must say,&quot; he began, &quot;I never expected 
to find HIM as one of them.&quot; He then looked at Sir Integra and added, 
&quot;Coincidence?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; the Hellsing leader added, &quot;but this might prove to be of our 
advantage to bring him into our investigation.&quot; She then brought up her 
word processing software and added, &quot;I will e-mail Miss Farrah in 
Chicago and see if I can request contact information on him.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully, it will be a wise choice,&quot; Walter said, but then added, 
&quot;However, given his reputation, one might wonder if it is otherwise?&quot;

&quot;Only time will tell,&quot; Sir Integra answered, once again looking at the 
name in the participant&#39;s list - Bean Bandit!
