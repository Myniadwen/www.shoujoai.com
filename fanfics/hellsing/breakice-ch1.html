<h1>Breaking the Ice</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hellsing/index.html">Hellsing</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dragonhealer.html">Dragonhealer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ceras watched in horror as Integra stabbed herself and collapsed.  A 
pool of blood slowly appeared beneath her.  The police girl screamed 
out the Hellsing leader&#39;s name.  Her environment changed, and the 
vampire girl found herself standing next to her master, the rogue 
vampire Alucard.  She turned to her side and saw Integra lying on an 
operation table, surrounded by doctors.  

The environment changed again, and Ceras saw a young Integra at age 
thirteen.  Her father&#39;s death, her own uncle&#39;s plotted assassination, 
her first meeting with Alucard, the newly released vampire killing off 
her uncle and his men, him accepting her as his master.  

Again her environment changed, and she found herself at the same place 
as if she never left.  Then one doctor walked up to the two vampires.  
She waited with eager anticipation.  He sadly shook his head.

Although it was impossible, Ceras could swear she felt her heart being 
stabbed a hundred times.  She struggled to stay on her balance, her 
mind frozen with shock.  When she turned to the table, to her horror, 
Alucard was drinking Integra&#39;s blood!

&quot;Master, no!  You can&#39;t!&quot;  she screamed, but for some reason, she 
could not move.  

Her master grinned at her, his fangs dripping with Hellsing blood.  
&quot;What&#39;s the point of having a Hellsing around if none are left?&quot;  He 
studied his apprentice&#39;s face.  Then he realized the truth.  &quot;So you 
did care for my master, didn&#39;t you, police girl?  How about if I leave 
her up to you?  Wouldn&#39;t you like to have another vampire by your 
side?&quot;  He let loose an insane laugh.

Ceras crumpled down, covering her ears to block out her master&#39;s 
insane laugh, closing her eyes.  &lt;It&#39;s true, I did love her!  I loved 
everything about her!  She was so strong, so determined, the opposite 
of me.  If only I told her how I truly cared for her, and even though 
she was human and I am a vampire, I did not care!  But now she&#39;s gone, 
gone from my life forever, just like my father.  No, I don&#39;t want her 
revived as a vampire!&gt;  &quot;NO!  I don&#39;t want her like me, Master!  
Integra!&quot;  she screamed.

The police girl woke up with a start, gasping for breath.  Her spiky 
blond hair was matted to her forehead.  She could still feel her own 
heart beating, which she thought was impossible.  It could be because 
she could still cling on to her human side.  The only times when she 
truly showed her vampire side was when she went into battle.  She 
looked around and realized she was in her room, sleeping in her big 
four-poster bed which was also a coffin.  She had slept with it open.  
Being a child vampire, she was able to sleep at night. She got the 
feeling that it was a little past midnight.  How she could tell, she 
did not know.  She shuddered, remembering how there are times when she 
goes into uncontrollable fits of blood rage.  She wondered if she 
would ever be able to control her other side.  

Running to the bathroom, she splashed cold water on her face and shook 
a little.  She glanced up at the mirror, and forgetting that she no 
longer had a reflection.  Suddenly a feeling of loneliness invaded her 
body.  Not understanding how she could still feel such emotions, she 
longed once more to see herself, to see what her expression was like.  
The only thing she did know was whenever people looked at her eyes, 
they knew she was different.  Her mind turned back to her dream.  
Image after image, until she reached her final words.  &lt;Is it true?  
Do I love her?&gt;  She never imagined she could ever love again, until 
she met Integra Wingates Hellsing.  Never had she ever met someone who 
was so strong, and the fact that she was female drew her even more.  
She remembered that fateful evening when Integra accepted her into her 
own life.  After staring at the sink for a few brief moments, she knew 
what she has to do.

She was no more than a foot away from her door when she picked up 
voices coming from the other side of Integra&#39;s bedroom door.  She 
forgot about her newfound powers.  Smiling a bit, she listened in as 
she walked.  Alucard and Integra were having another one of their 
interesting conversations.  The vampire was taunting her of a funny 
thing she did as a child, as it turns out, when he got her into 
chasing him after scaring her and she fell into a laundry basket.  
Ceras chuckled a bit after hearing Integra&#39;s response, in her normally 
cold voice.  She entered the room.  Both human and vampire turned to 
her.  

&quot;Police girl.&quot; Alucard, who was at the foot of the bed, said at the 
same time Integra, who was sitting on her bed, said, &quot;Sergeant 
Victoria.&quot;  It would have been useless, as Alucard already knew about 
their first secret meeting.  Integra turned to Alucard.  He nodded and 
disappeared from the room.  &quot;Ceras.&quot;  Her voice soothingly calm.  She 
smiled and motioned her new companion to sit beside her.

The minute she sat on the bed and looked at Integra, she was 
immediately entranced.  As usual, Integra was stunningly gorgeous in 
her female nightgown, her long shimmering platinum hair flowing down 
her shoulders.  Her glasses were off, revealing even more beautiful 
violet blue eyes.  Ceras could feel all the blood she ever drank fill 
her cheeks.  &lt;Speechless as usual&gt;  Integra shook her head a little.  

She leaned in closer and gently touched her cheek.  Ceras snapped back 
to reality and realized why she was there.  &quot;You know you are more 
than welcome to enter my room, young officer.  Are you still not used 
to me in this way?&quot; Integra said in a musing tone.  

&quot;I&#39;m......I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just that, every time I see you in your 
nightgown, I can&#39;t think of anything else.&quot;  She lowered her head.  
&quot;You&#39;re just so.....so.....beautiful.&quot;  Her last sentence was reduced 
to a whisper.  

Integra gently cupped her chin and raised her pretty face up to hers.  
&quot;And so are you.  You are very pretty in yours, dear Ceras.&quot;  Ceras 
forgot she was also in her pajamas. 

&lt;&quot;Dear Ceras&quot;?  Oh God, does that mean she.....she wants to take 
it....that way?&gt; Blushing even more, she poured out her explanation of 
her nightmare.  

When she was finished, she shuddered a bit.  Noticing this, Integra 
gently pulled her into a hug.  The vampire girl could feel the warmth 
being radiated from her body.  &quot;My poor little vampire.  What an awful 
thing to happen to you.  You have been through so much,&quot;  Integra 
spoke softly as she stroked Ceras&#39; hair.  This was truly a change in 
her personality.  Ever since their first night together the Hellsing 
leader had another side to her usual cold personality.  Ceras had 
changed all that.  Whenever she saw the police officer Integra would 
secretly smile and feel a lot calmer.  Ceras was silent for a moment, 
thinking things through.

&quot;Integra......&quot;  Ceras said, still feeling a bit awkward for saying 
her first name.  &quot;I think I do have those kinds of feelings for you.&quot;  

Remembering her last words, Integra was shocked with disbelief.  &lt;How 
is this possible?  How can a vampire fall in love?  And with someone 
like me?  Why?  But she is different....she is more...human.  She may 
have been born from Alucard&#39;s blood, but she is still who she has 
always been.  How can she love me?  But......I also have feelings for 
her.&gt;  She asked Ceras the question.  Ceras thought for a moment, then 
looked up at Integra.  

Suddenly the vampire girl&#39;s eyes filled with tears.  &quot;I.....I don&#39;t 
know how, but I do know why.  I may be a vampire, but I do love you, 
Integra.  You have always been so strong.  If only I had been under 
your tutelage instead of Master&#39;s.  You were the other human I wanted 
to get closer too.  And because you&#39;re female.  That nightmare might 
have been a sign or something.  I don&#39;t care that you&#39;re human and I&#39;m 
not.  I still have feelings and emotions, and I do love you.  I lost 
my father, my entire squad, and I almost lost you, but I am not about 
to lose you again!&quot;  And with that, she encircled her arms around the 
older woman&#39;s waist and kissed her.  

Her words stunned Integra even more.  She had never heard such words 
from a vampire.  Ceras&#39; kiss was passionate.  Their very first kiss.  
When it was over, Ceras distant herself from Integra, with her head 
down.  Integra froze for a moment, tasting her lips.  It tasted of 
blood, but miraculously, she did not mind.  She would have scolded her 
for doing that, but she did give her permission to enter her room and 
have bodily contact with her.  Her mind reeling, thoughts overflowing, 
it was almost too much for her to take.  She looked at Ceras.  &quot;Ceras 
Victoria,&quot; she spoke firmly.  

Integra never imagined she would be kissed by a vampire.  There would 
have been murder if Alucard ever did that to her.  But Ceras was a 
young girl, her underling.  Integra figured she had a lot to learn 
about love.  She could feel her heart warming up as she looked at 
Ceras&#39; pretty face, her crimson eyes shimmering.   Her eyes.  She had 
forgotten she was mostly drawn to those blood-red eyes. 

&quot;Your eyes.  Everytime I looked into them I always felt an intense 
hatred deep within me.  But no more.  You have done nothing worth 
being hated for.  I find your eyes beautiful and even enchanting,&quot; 
Integra spoke softly.  Ceras smiled.  

&quot;But Ceras, do you realize that if word of this gets out, it&#39;s 
possible it could destroy us both forever?&quot;  

Ceras stared at her.  It never crossed her mind.  She shook her head.  
&quot;No matter what happens, I won&#39;t let anything harm you, not ever.&quot;  
She kissed her again, and fell into her arms.  Integra could feel the 
young vampire&#39;s heavy breathing.  Slowly, a thought occurred in her 
mind.  She knew tonight was the perfect night for it.  

&quot;Ceras, can you prove that you are a much better friend 
and.....lover....for me?&quot;  

She immediately shot up her head and just stared into Integra&#39;s eyes.  
Suddenly she knew what she had planned.  &quot;Sir......I 
mean.....Integra....are you saying you want me to.......to make love 
to you?&quot;  

Integra smiled.  &quot;I see Alucard gave you more than just his blood.  
Very impressive.&quot;  

Ceras was shocked.  &quot;I....I could never do that to you.....how could 
I.....I can&#39;t......&quot;  she was stopped in mid-sentence when Integra put 
her hands on the young girl&#39;s shoulders, locking her eyes with Ceras&#39;.  

&quot;I also have strong feelings for you, Ceras, but unless you do that to 
me, I will not know if I also love you.  I am giving you special 
permission, Sergeant Victoria,&quot; she said her title and name in a sweet 
tone.  The vampire girl froze.  After a moment of hesitation, Integra 
decided to resort to more drastic measures, as an entranced Ceras 
continued staring off into space.  

&lt;Me?  Make love to Integra?  How could I?&gt;  

She felt Integra slowly undressing, not bothering to look.  Until she 
heard a soft sound, and she knew it was Integra&#39;s nightgown dropping 
on the floor.  Slowly she turned her heard.  If looks could kill.  She 
had never imagined what Integra would look like naked.  Almost nothing 
in the young girl&#39;s mind could describe Integra&#39;s body.  It was like 
that of a goddess.  There was another full moon, and Ceras slowly felt 
a tiny lust deep within her.  Integra recognized the strange glint in the 
vampire&#39;s eyes, the same Alucard had for her.  Smiling, she pulled her 
into a passionate kiss, while slowly undressing hers.  Ceras was 
careful as to not harm Integra in any way.  The moment the kiss was 
over she felt a slight breeze.  She looked down and realized she was 
half-nude.  She looked at Integra, and she knew she wanted to do it with 
her.  Since her nightmare, she knew it all along.  The vampire girl 
discarded the rest of her clothing.

She leaned in and ran her tongue all over Integra&#39;s body.  She let out 
a long moan as the vampire girl pleased her.  She 
savored the taste, her lust growing more and more until she could 
barely control it.  Sensing this, Integra lowered her head and sucked 
on the young girl&#39;s breast.  &quot;You have a lovely body.  It has always 
attracted me.  You have such big breasts.....impressive...&quot; she gently 
bit into them, causing her lover to let out a soft cry.  Then she 
caressed it with her tongue.  Ceras had never felt so alive.

&quot;Oh, God......Sir Integra.....,&quot;  Ceras moaned as Integra continued.  

She stopped for a moment.  &quot;Why do you continue to call me by that 
title?  Aren&#39;t you worthy of being my true lover?&quot;  she asked calmly.  

&quot;Forgive me.....Integra.....I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Integra licked her new 
lover&#39;s nipples, pleasing her even more.

Integra looked down at Ceras&#39; vagina.  It looked hairless.  Licking 
her lips, she lashed out her tongue deep within.  Ceras practically 
howled.  Never in her life has she had such an experience.  Integra 
continued until she found her clitoris, and one touch it of sent an 
intense bolt of pleasure surging through the vampire girl&#39;s body.  

She let loose a passionate scream, then stopped, her breath growing 
more intense and ragged.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong, my little vampire?  Too much 
for you to handle?  Didn&#39;t you remember to drink your blood before 
coming here?&quot;  

&lt;She sounds just like Master&#39;s....if this is what she wants, why 
should I let her have all the fun?&gt; Ceras smiled to herself.  She 
relaxed a bit, signaling Integra to go on. 

Integra continued to touch her clitoris with her tongue, until a white 
liquid was released.  Integra licked at it until the vagina was clean 
again.   &quot;My, for a vampire you have a wonderful taste.&quot;  

&quot;I can&#39;t wait to taste you too, Integra,&quot; Ceras mused.  Desiring more, 
Integra licked her stomach, kissing it softly while massaging Ceras&#39; 
breasts.  More moans of pleasure were heard as Ceras&#39; body released 
more cum.  Integra drank more of it until she was satisfied.  She 
decided to give the young girl what she deserved, an orgasm, and she 
did just that, grinding her vagina against Ceras&#39;.

&quot;Oh......Integra......that&#39;s it.....oh God!&quot;  Ceras could no longer 
control her sounds of pleasure.  Integra stuck two of her fingers deep 
within her vagina, and it was the biggest, most pleasure-intensifying 
orgasm the police girl has ever had.  &quot;INTEGRA!&quot;  she screamed.  She 
could no longer take it.  Had she really been dead she would have 
thought she was in heaven.  She felt every ounce of her energy drained 
as Integra helped the young vampire lie down on her lap.

Ceras panted like a dog waiting for her energy to be 
restored.  Integra looked down at her.  &quot;I hope I did not harm you in 
any way.  Did I, my love?&quot;  she whispered.  Ceras barely had the 
strength to speak.  &quot;It seems to me that you are in dire need of more 
training. I see you carry your weapom around all the time.  Surely you 
must have more strength than this.&quot;  

Silence.  Then she responded, &quot;I&#39;m still young compared to Master.  I 
only have the required strengh when I go into battle, I never imagined 
I would be needing it for this.&quot;  

&quot;Then I guess you would have to make that one exception,&quot; Integra said 
in a mysterious tone.  &quot;I know you have always desired me.  The minute 
I saw Alucard carrying you in his arms, I know you would have the same 
lust he has always had for me since the day we met.  He tasted my 
blood.  Would you like to taste it as well?&quot;

Still breathing heavily, Ceras shook her head.  &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to 
taste your blood.  I am not like Master.  It&#39;s true, just seeing that 
full moon is when I have a lust for your body.  Aren&#39;t you afraid 
Master or Walter would disapprove of us like this?&quot;

Integra thought for a moment before responding, &quot;It does not matter 
what they think whether they know or not. I chose you to be my lover.  
That is all that matters.  You have proven your worth, enough, dear 
Ceras.  I will never ignore you again.  You are not just another 
officer. You tried to save me.  I love you for that.&quot;

Ceras felt relieved.  Then she felt her strength returning.  &quot;Integra, 
I&#39;m ready to make love to you this time.&quot;  She got up and looked at 
her new lover&#39;s body.  Just looking at it increased her lust.  She 
attacked Integra&#39;s breasts with her tongue lashing.  Integra let out a 
long moan.  This is what she wanted.  To find out how long Ceras would 
be able to control her lustful side.  Ceras struggled not to pierce 
the delicate skin with her fangs, struggling to focus only on 
pleasing, not feeding.  She wondered why Alucard never made a move the 
way she was.  Suddenly she considered herself very lucky.  She sucked 
on Integra&#39;s ample breast, savoring the taste.  It was more than she 
could possible handle.  Integra moaned more in pleasure, letting the 
vampire girl have her way with her.  &lt;It&#39;s because I let her, I should 
have no regrets&gt; she thought to herself.  Ceras stopped sucking, 
breathing hard, struggling not to bite.  She could feel her wild side 
rising, but she managed to surpress it.

&quot;What, are you finished now?&quot;  Integra teased.  One look at the 
vampire&#39;s fiery eyes and she knew immediately the answer.  Ceras could 
tell she was practically offering her beautiful body to her.  &quot;What&#39;s 
the matter?  Am I too much for you?&quot; she teased seductively.  The 
sound of her voice was all it took to turn the vampire girl on. She 
lunged at her vagina, licking at it with all her might.  The sound of 
her lover&#39;s howl of pleasure satisfied her very well.  How long has 
she been waiting for this moment.  How long she was been wanting to 
please the one person who accepted her, who gave her a purpose when 
she had no other.  She sucked her clitoris hard, drinking up all of 
the Hellsing&#39;s cum.  She was groaning like an animal, licking her 
lips, her desire growing more and more.  Her eyes looked more wild.  
Sweat was covering her pale skin.  
&quot;That&#39;s it, Ceras......don&#39;t stop......my vampire lover.....&quot;  Integra 
moaned out loud, urging her own.  She attacked her other ample breast, 
after passionately kissing her platinum-haired lover, pushing her 
tongue to meet Integra&#39;s.  Both moaned during the kiss.  Integra could 
feel her energy slow draining.  She whispered into Ceras&#39; ear, &quot;I love 
you.&quot;  The sheet was getting more wet as more of Integra&#39;s cum came 
out of her.  Half of the time Ceras licked at the sheet while kissing 
her lover&#39;s neck.  Kissing the neck was the biggest challenge ever.  

&lt;No, I will NOT betray her.  She has already done so much for me.  I 
will NOT feed on her!  Bloody hell!  I will conquer my vampire side!&gt;  
The powerful words appeared in her mind as she focused on being more 
gentle. She gently felt ran her fingers through Integra&#39;s long soft 
hair.  She whispered hotly into her ear as she licked it, &quot;I love you, 
too.&quot;

Integra slowly arched her back as Ceras&#39; tongue-lashing gave her an 
orgasm.  More energy surged through the young vampire as she licked 
again at her vagina.  She licked at her hips, legs and thighs.  She 
pressed her breasts against Integra&#39;s, practically rocking with her.  
They moaned in sexual pleasure.  Both released their own cum as it 
mixed with the other.  Ceras grinded her hips against Integra, moaning 
even louder.  She looked down at Integra&#39;s vagina and saw it was very 
wet.  With a gleam in her eyes she lunged at it, cleaning it with her 
tongue.  Neither one has ever felt this much intensity of pleasure.  
Ceras never wanted to make love to anyone else other than Integra.  
She caressed her hands down Integra&#39;s back, kissing her hard.  

Finally, both lay down on the bed, breathing heavily.  Both bodies 
seemed to shine in sweat.  Integra slowly embraced the younger girl 
into her arms, smiling at her.  Ceras smiled back.  &quot;You have a 
beautiful face, Integra.  I am envious.&quot;  

&quot;You should not, for I am envious of you. You have beautiful eyes.&quot;  

Both were silent for a moment.  Ceras stared up at the ceiling.  A 
gentle breeze made the curtains fluttler.  The moon continued to 
shine.  Ceras turned back to Integra.  &quot;Am I worthy of being your 
lover?&quot;  

Integra just looked at her.  She kissed her softly.  &quot;You should 
already know the answer to that, young vampire.&quot;  

Ceras suddenly had a worried look on her face.  &quot;Integra, I am proud 
of being with you, but.....shouldn&#39;t you......you know......for the 
sake of the organization....&quot; she blushed furiously.  Integra gently 
placed a finger on Ceras&#39; lips.   

&quot;Tell me, my dear Ceras, do you honestly think it impossible for 
another to fall in love with me?&quot;  she asked with a mysterious grin.  
Smiling, Ceras shook her head.  &quot;Then you don&#39;t have to worry about 
that for now.  You will always be the one I can always turn to.&quot;  
Ceras smiled.  &quot;You have had enough for tonight.  Please, go to 
sleep.&quot;  Ceras closed her eyes and was immediately asleep.  Integra 
watched her for a moment.  

&lt;She truly is a wonder.  A vampire, but with the mind of a child.  
It&#39;s like her heart has somehow managed to stay alive.  And being able 
to sleep at night.  What a twisted change of fate for her to be turned 
into a vampire and being brought here.  Alucard would never be amused 
about this.  Then again, he would probably find it a twisted joke.  
Imagine, me, a Hellsing, but with a vampire.  She has truly broken 
through me.  I thank you, Ceras Victoria.&gt;  she gently covered both of 
their bodies, placing her arm protectively around the police girl, and 
fell asleep.

Nearby, Alucard watched, grinning.  &lt;Well, well, well, what an 
interesting predicament.  You have made me extremly proud, police 
girl.  You just may be of use to me even more.  It&#39;s too bad I was not 
here sooner.&gt;

Grinning from ear to ear, he disappeared.
