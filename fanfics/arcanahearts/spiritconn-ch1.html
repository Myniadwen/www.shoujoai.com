<h1>Spiritual Connection</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../arcanahearts/index.html">Arcana Heart</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bluerain.html">Blue Rain</a><br> </h2>
<pre>We both agreed that we always had feelings for each other. It was more than platonic. 
However, we used to never talk about it. We never wanted to risk driving each other away, 
never breaking the status quo. We were content to be &quot;just friends.&quot; It took something big 
to change that. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The sky shook. The normal blue hue was swirling unnatural shades of purple and orange. Holes 
opened in the clouds that threatened to swallow the world. This chaos is what Mildred Avalon 
has spent most of her life for.  

She was once a 17-year-old human. Mildred was an attractive young woman. Her blonde hair was 
cut short to her shoulders. Her eyes were a sharp blue hue. Her skin was pale and smooth. 
She was busty. Her legs, hips, and waist were sharply defined. Her conspicuous curves were 
tightly constrained into her outfit. 

After transforming, her physical form changed little, but she took on an unearthly form. Her 
hair was became impossibly golden and suddenly grew to ankle-length. Her mane parted down 
the middle, with two sections curved behind each side of her. Her locks swayed and moved 
without the aid of wind, almost on their own accord. Her wardrobe was pure white, and her 
visible aura of power matched it. Worst of all were her new eyes: crazy and red. 

Mildred gained power few mortals had. She could fly. With a snap of her fingers, she could 
control the elements. She manipulated energy, fire, lightning, earth, metal, and virtually 
anything she could think of. Avalon was an Archangel now, and felt that she was fit to rule 
the world. All that was left was to bring an apocalypse to begin the world anew. By her new 
power that made the heavens quake, this was well underway. 

Opposing Mildred was Saki Tsuzura. She was young 14-year-old girl, fighting while still in 
her school uniform. She wore a crimson vest over her white polo shirt and red tie, an orange 
miniskirt, black stockings, formal dress shoes, and a hair band in her long, thigh-length 
blue hair. Even though she was hardly dressed for combat, she was a more than a competent 
fighter. Furthermore, she was the vessel for Bhanri, Arcana of Lightning. Saki&#39;s soul and 
Bhanri were tied together, and thus the Arcana blessed Saki with flight and the ability to 
manipulate electricity from the sky. Bhanri, despite being an intangible spirit, was 
virtually fighting alongside Saki and expressed power through the young girl. 

They fought on the roof of a floating castle in the skies of Tokyo. Saki pursued while 
Mildred evaded, only trying to stall until the dimensions barriers collapsed. Again and 
again, Saki would fly at her foe with blows and thunder, and Mildred would have to fight her 
off, try to blast her with fire, thunder, materialized swords, and energy before teleporting 
away. Both combatants took heavy damage, but Mildred was gaining the upper hand. As the 
fight dragged on, it was apparently that Saki was tiring out while the Archangel did not put 
much effort into evading her. 

Saki came at her again with a swinging kick to the stomach. &quot;Take this!&quot;  It connected, 
causing Mildred to grunt and double over into the kick. Saki then followed up by flying up 
wards with a vertically-spinning kick aimed at Mildred&#39;s face, ala Guile&#39;s Flash Kick. This 
Mildred blocked with a magical energy field, leaving Saki wide open to attack. Mildred 
chuckled and snapped her fingers. 

A great flash of light appeared, and Saki screamed as she was blown away by a great deal of 
concussive force. She lost her flight and skidded across the concrete floor. Her head was 
swimming from the blow, and she did not regain her balance, land rest face down third yards 
from Mildred. She tried in vain to get back on her feet, but could barely move. 

Mildred continued to float in the air as she grinned. &quot;This is for the good of the world, 
yet you oppose my angelic authority. You are a fool, and now you are going to die for it.&quot; 
Saki sobbed on the ground as Mildred approached. Every since the sky changed a week ago, she 
knew what was going to happen. She has lost her friend Fiona Mayfield two years before. Now, 
even if she didn&#39;t die, she was still going to lose Heart Aino and Fiona forever. 

Bhanri was hurting with Saki. The noble spirit wanted to protect Saki and her friends, and 
defend against the insane and tyrannically Mildred. Saki felt her bones ache, the intangible 
spirit urging her on. Bhanri desperately tried to shock the approaching Archangel, but her 
vessel was too weak from battle. Bhanri cried out to the spirits, as Saki was surely lost. 

&quot;AWESOMELY HEARTFUL PUNCH!&quot; 

It was Heart&#39;s voice. Saki raised her face off the ground, and stared. Her classmate and 
best friend Heart Aino must have had an Arcana of her own. Heart had made her way up the 
floating castle and has arrived just in time to save her life. With that squeaky yell, Heart 
dragon punched Mildred high into the sky. Mildred tried to regain her balance from the force 
of such an awful punch. Heart stood triumphantly in front of Saki, ribbon-wrapped fist 
raised into the sky. The girl had pink hair, with a heart-shaped bang. She wore a standard 
school uniform, except she wore socks that doubled as leg stockings, and had bright red 
ribbons tied around each wrist. Her right had three foot standards, and they flowed with the 
wind as Heart kept her fist raised.  

Heart stopped and regarded Saki. &quot;Saki! You have to get up! She won&#39;t be gone for long, but 
we can beat her. We must both use our Arcana.&quot; Heart quickly pulled Saki up, but she 
couldn&#39;t stand on her own. Saki wrapped an arm around Heart&#39;s shoulder, and leaned on her 
support. Heart put her left arm around Saki&#39;s waist, and supported her with a hand. 

&quot;Heart... thank you...&quot; Saki wiped a tear from her face. 

&quot;It&#39;s what I do for love. Now go! Lift your arm and focus your Arcana&#39;s power into the air 
in front of you.&quot; 

Both girls pointed at Mildred and beckoned their Arcana. The hues and terrain of the world 
started to change as the girls contacted the spirit world. The imposing, blue and mighty 
form of Bhanri appeared before the girls. Her spiritual body was a series of metallic rocks, 
but she had the face of a woman. Sparks shot from her in all directions and made loud 
crashes. Next to her appeared the heavenly eight-winged angel Partinias, the Arcana of Love. 
Her every motion was fluid and slow, as if she was underwater, so her long pink hair 
billowed above her. She was topless, but wad a long flowing dress, and wings extended on 
either side of her head, back, hips, and waist. Bhanri was uncomfortable with sharing the 
same space, but she&#39;d do anything for Saki. However, all-loving Partinias did not mind at 
all, as she smiled at nothing. 

Mildred was flying back at them by then, enraged, grin completely replaced with anger. &quot;YOU 
BITCH! YOU MUD! I deserve this world, and you will not stop it from being purified!&quot; 

&quot;Saki, take my hand!&quot; Saki immediately obeyed. Both girls raised their joined hands into the 
sky and pressed into each other. &quot;Focus your Arcana into me, and I&#39;ll do the same for you! 
We can get through this!&quot; 
 
Before them, Bhanri and Partinias started to flow into each other. Bhanri almost protested, 
but urgently melded with Partinias to double their power. Their spiritual consciousness 
merged together, transforming the goddesses into a new mass, pink and blue. Partinias and 
Bhanri arced their faces toward the sky, toward Mildred, in pleasure of their new power. 
Together, they became a higher being, and it felt wonderful. 

The girls continued to hold each other and stared at the scene before them. They were 
mystified by the implications. Each girl felt new energy course through their veins. Their 
magic was much greater now, and they both shared an energy aura of purple fire. The fast 
approaching Mildred caught their attention again. 

&quot;Heart, lets use our best spells! We can fight her with our new Arcana!&quot; Saki cried out over 
the sound of the heavens quaking and magic sparking. 

&quot;Right! Put everything into this moment!&quot; 

Both girls shouted as they raised their held hands toward Mildred. 

&quot;Ilios Sfaira!&quot; 

&quot;Stoirm!&quot; 

The purple giant before them focused itself into a Spirit Bomb-esque ball of magic. The 
heavens shook even harder. It was pink, but was sparking with Bhanri&#39;s lightning, making it 
light indigo glow. Mildred gasped, stopped in her place, and hastily shot a spell of holy 
light at it. Channels of light rained down at the ball, but Bhanri and Partinias only 
absorbed them. The sphere of magic quickly approached and consumed Mildred. The Archangel 
cried out as she died. The sphere then descended on the castle, both castle and the globe of 
power vanished. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Catastrophe was averted, and life went on. Saki and Heart resumed their studies at the 
Misono Academy for Girls in Tokyo: No one knew that they were the saviors of the world. A 
week has passed, and while the girls quietly celebrated their victory, they started avoiding 
each other. This is because new, uncomfortable feelings arose. 

After the fight with Mildred, Bhanri and Partinias separated again and resumed their 
attachment to each girl&#39;s soul. However, both Arcana ached for contact again. They loved 
being one super-being, but were attached to their Maidens. The Arcanas&#39; wantonness grew 
overwhelming. It caused the Maidens to ache for each other. Saki and Heart were constantly 
distracted be thoughts of each other, whether alone or in company. Whenever they were to 
near each other at school, their souls rose as their Arcana begged to be together again. 
They couldn&#39;t look at each other without blushing. Surprised and uncomfortable with these 
new feelings, the Maidens avoided each other. 

Heart was the first of them to come to terms with her feelings. During a long night, Heart 
accepted that she was both emotionally and sexually attracted to Saki. At the very least, 
she wanted to re-establish her friendship with her childhood companion. Heart understood 
that Saki was probably suffering the same effects, thus why she was avoiding her. &quot;We are 
friends, and we&#39;re suffering this together,&quot; Heart thought &quot;but Saki still might not want to 
be my lover. I won&#39;t force anything on her... But we need to be buddies again.&quot; 
 
 

WHAM! 

The volleyball hit the concrete with a loud impact. Heart had intercepted a serve just after 
it flew over the net. This put her team three points ahead, meaning she won. 

Both she and Saki wore their gym class uniforms: tight t-shirts and red bloomers. Everyone 
was sweaty as they played in the outdoors on the concrete. While Heart played volleyball, 
Saki played badminton nearby. While both girls tried to distract themselves with their game, 
Heart noticed Saki&#39;s gaze. Constantly, Saki stared at Heart. Whenever the pink-haired maiden 
noticed, Saki would blush and quickly turn away. Saki would repeatedly miss her serve 
because she was distracted by Heart. She was flattered, and thought it was endearing. 

&quot;Saki&#39;s so cute. &lt;3&quot; Heart wanted to gush and swoon over Saki&#39;s attention, but did not want 
to make a scene. 

Soon, class came to a close and the girls had to shower. Heart noted with amusement that 
Saki had turned a deep red hue as she undressed. More than ever did the blue-haired maiden 
stare at her class mate. 

&quot;Heart is gorgeous.&quot; Saki thought as she tried to inconspicuously stare at the bathing 
Maiden. &quot;We&#39;ve always been best friends, but I never noticed how... smooth and curvy she is. 
I... I can&#39;t stop staring at her...&quot; Heart&#39;s b-cup breasts and round ass kept catching her 
attention. Bhanri caused Saki to shake and begged for her to touch Heart. Heart almost 
giggled. She could tell she was being watched, but she knew that if she turned her head, 
Saki would look away. Heart felt like an exhibitionist. Partinias continued to beckon Bhanri 
forth, and Bhanri begged for Saki to go. 

As school ended, Saki tried to quickly pace home. She kept her head down, ashamed. However, 
today Heart would have none of that. She caught up to her long-time friend. 

&quot;SAKIIIIII! Slow down!&quot; 

Saki turned and regarded her friend with a smile. &quot;Oh, hi Heart.&quot; Bhanri soared at the sight 
of Partinias&#39; vessel. 

&quot;Saki, we haven&#39;t talked in so long. Come over to my house today! Pleeeease.&quot; Heart begged 
with watering chocolate-colored eyes. Bhanri also begged her Maiden. 

Saki blushed and replied. &quot;Well, I have nothing to do today...&quot; 

Heart was overjoyed. She didn&#39;t wait for an answer. &quot;Yippeeeee! Saki, I have a great 
strawberry cake to share with you. It&#39;s waiting in my fridge. Lets go!&quot; She grabbed Saki by 
the wrist, causing both Saki and Bhanri feel a jolt, and pulled her the opposite way. 

&quot;Ouch! Heart, let go! That&#39;s too hard.&quot; Saki pulled her arm away, but then smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t 
need help to walk with you, silly.&quot; Bhanri cried out at the loss of contact with the Arcana 
of Love, but both girls continued on their way. 

For the first time since the fight with Mildred, Saki felt cheerful. She giggled and chatted 
with Heart like she used to. She cast aside her worry and awkwardness as Heart lead her 
around. Soon they arrived at Heart&#39;s home, Caf&Atilde;&copy;-Aino. &quot;Don&#39;t you have to work there with 
your parents today?&quot; 
 
Heart beamed. &quot;Nope. The caf&Atilde;&copy; is close right now so we can renovate the interior. And my 
parents are away on business at the moment.&quot; 

&quot;Oh. That&#39;s nice. We don&#39;t have to worry about intruding on anyone then.&quot; 

Heart grinned and shrugged. &quot;Come inside. I have the best cake waiting for you.&quot; They went 
upstairs into the house part of the building of Caf&Atilde;&copy;-Aino. 

They entered the off-white kitchen. Saki sat herself down at the table while Heart dug into 
the fridge. Saki could not help but stare at the Heart as she bent over in front of the 
fridge. Her Arcana demanded that she pounce the girl right there, but Saki maintained her 
composure. Heart then presented her with the pinkest cake Saki has ever seen. 

&quot;Here you are! I made this myself. It has strawberries on top, as you can see, and in the 
dough. One of the costumers ordered this, but canceled after I already made it. Consider it 
a cake for saving the world.&quot; 
 
&quot;Oh my goodness Heart. You look like you really outdid yourself.&quot; Saki almost drooled at the 
round cake. It&#39;s frosting was pink, and was indeed topped with dozens of berries. 

The girls split the cake in half between themselves. Heart cut a piece with her fork and put 
it in her mouth. She squealed high. &quot;Oh my! Saki you have to try this. Don&#39;t just stare... 
at it.&quot; 

Saki blushed (she was staring at her friend again) and tried some. It was indeed very good. 
It was sweet, but strawberry juice gushed into her mouth. 

&quot;Mmmmm. You bake the best stuff.&quot; 

The girls quickly ate the cake. Soon the lounged in Heart&#39;s bedroom, also extremely pink. 
Heart sat on her bed, flipping through a magazine, whilst Saki sat at the desk, searching 
around the Internet. Both girls were barely interested in what they were doing, chatting for 
hours. 

Eventually, Heart put down her magazine. &quot;Saki, what are you looking at?&quot; She got up from 
the bed and walked toward the desk. 

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m just emailing a friend from England.&quot; 
 
&quot;Ohhh, can I see it?&quot; Heart leaned in over Saki&#39;s shoulder, their cheeks barely touching. As 
Heart read, Saki could feel the other Maiden&#39;s breathe on her neck and face. Bhanri begged. 
Saki grappled with her wantonness. Her heart pounded in her chest, and breathe hitched. Her 
face burned red as she struggled to keep her cool. 

Moments passed like hours. Finally, an action uncontrollably broke through the surface. Saki 
kissed Heart on the cheek. 

Heart&#39;s eyes widened as she froze. Then, she turned to Saki and smiled. Extremely relieved, 
Saki smiled back. The Maidens softly pressed their lips together. Their Arcana were 
overjoyed to be one again, as invisible sparks flew around the girls. Saki felt pure 
electricity, and moaned softly, opening her mouth slightly. Heart took the initiative and 
slid her tongue into Saki&#39;s mouth. The girls sighed together as they gently explored each 
other&#39;s mouths. 

Eventually, they both broke for air. Heart tried to form words between pants. &quot;Saki... Do 
you want...&quot; 

Saki only put a finger to Heart&#39;s soft lips, and nodded. 

Heart gave Saki another kiss. Soon, she broke it and drew a trail of kisses along Saki&#39;s 
jaw. She slowly made her way to the blue-haired Maiden&#39;s ear, and kissed it. Saki let out a 
near-inaudible moan, but her new lover heard it and chuckled. She gave the ear a long, wet 
lick, causing Saki to gasp out for air. She bit down and suckled, making her girlfriend 
squirm in the chair. She made her way down her neck, and gave it dozens of kisses and licks. 
Saki drew hard, slow breathes and shook all over. Suddenly, Heart bite down, hard, on the 
front of Saki&#39;s throat, making her cry out. 

After minutes of this attention, Heart slide her hands up and down up Saki&#39;s midriff. She 
kneaded her girlfriend&#39;s breasts for a moment, then moved to the viper on Saki&#39;s vest. Saki 
breathed hard Heart unbuttoned her school uniform, revealing her white C bra. Heart ran her 
hands over the smooth, pale skin of Saki&#39;s front, still not unlatching her mouth from Saki&#39;s 
neck and face. Saki breathe hard through her mouth in anticipation. Heart rubbed and rolled 
her girlfriend&#39;s boobs through the fabric of the bra, and bit down on her ear again. Saki 
loud moaned out and bucked. Finally, the pink Maiden unsnapped the bra and let it fall to 
the floor. 
 
Her vest and shirt open, Saki&#39;s chest and midriff was completely revealed. She was extremely 
curvaceous for a 14 year old, and busty. Heart ran her fingertips around Saki&#39;s pale 
nipples, and then squeezed down on each breast. Saki moaned out as Heart roughly kneaded her 
and pinched. She couldn&#39;t stay silent. Heart took on of her nipples and rolled in back in 
forth between her fingers, and while she groped and massaged the other breast. Saki arced 
her back, thrusting her chest into Heart&#39;s hands. As Saki cried out in pain and pleasure, 
Heart stole an open-mouth kiss from her. Saki moaned into the French kiss, locking tongues. 
Saki&#39;s panties became damp. 

Almost in response, Heart let go of one breasts and glided her free hand down Saki&#39;s waist. 
Her right hand was still gripped and rolling her breast. Saki noisily cooed into Heart&#39;s 
mouth as she rubbed her abs. 

Heart then slipped her hand into Saki&#39;s orange skirt, and rubbed the front with her finger 
tips. Saki broke the kissed and cried out toward the ceiling. She thrust her hips into 
Heart&#39;s fingers, but Heart didn&#39;t give her any more contact, only touching with the tips. 
Saki begged with whimpers and coos. Heart chuckled, and bit down on her ear again, gave her 
tit and hard squeeze, and palmed Saki&#39;s panties. The blue Maiden almost screamed in ecstasy 
as she arced her back, grinded her hips, and nearly fell off the chair. 

Heart felt Saki&#39;s snatch grow damper and damper. She rubbed hard against Saki&#39;s sex, and 
Saki moaned and gushed more juice. As Heart licked up and down Saki&#39;s neck, she decided that 
enough was enough. She slipped her hand into the panties. First she just cupped her cunt. 
Saki cried out and grinded harder against her girlfriend&#39;s hand. Saki felt like her head was 
swimming as she squirmed under Heart&#39;s grip. She could feel something building in her womb, 
but she wasn&#39;t sure what. All she knew is that she wanted it badly. 

Heart found Saki&#39;s clit and rubbed it between a finger and a thumb. Saki screamed the 
loudest she ever had. She bucked and thrashed, bouncing her free breast while the other was 
still being kneaded. A shiny layer of sweat drenched Saki. Heart inserted a finger into Saki 
while still playing with her clit with a thumb. Saki cried out as she clamped down on the 
finger which wiggled inside her. 
 

&quot;AAAAAAHHHH... AAAHHHHH GODS...&quot; 
 
Saki filled the room with heavenly noises. That same feeling continued to build in Saki, and 
she needed release. Heart quickly pumped two fingers in and out of her lover, rubbing 
against her G-Spot. Saki&#39;s voice rose higher the longer this went on, and she squirmed 
harder. Heart bit down hard on an ear. She squeezed a breast as hard as could. She pumped 
harder. She pressed her thumb against her girlfriend&#39;s clit and rubbed it. She then stole 
Saki&#39;s lips with her own and forced her tongue in. 

Saki squeezed her eyes closed and cried out into Heart&#39;s mouth as she experienced her first 
orgasm. She bucked her hips harder than ever as milky cum skirted out of her. Her orgasmic 
screams rose with each buck, and arced her face toward Heart. She stained her panties, 
skirt, stockings, and Heart&#39;s hand. She continued to scream into Heart&#39;s mouth as grinded 
against Heart&#39;s fingers, gradually slowing her pace. She came one last time as she bucked 
for the last time, then sighed out. 

The girls unlatched from each other, hands and lips, and Heart simply wrapped her arms 
around Saki&#39;s neck. Between heavy breathes, Saki asked: &quot;Heart, what happened?&quot; 
 
Heart responded in a childish voice. &quot;You overflowed because I love you that much.&quot; 

&quot;But why did we? We didn&#39;t talk to each other, we just, did it...&quot; 

Heart paused. &quot;I... I&#39;m not sure. Maybe our Arcana like each other, and they wanted us to do 
this. All I know is that we both wanted this.&quot; 

&quot;Heart?&quot; 

&quot;Yes?&quot; 

&quot;Do you really love me.&quot; 
 
&quot;Of course I do! I wouldn&#39;t have done that if I didn&#39;t.&quot; 

&quot;I think I love you too. Have... have we always felt this way?&quot; 
 
&quot;I... I think we always had something for each other. We might have always felt romantic to 
each other. Maybe the Arcana just made those feelings stronger.&quot; 

Saki sighed and leaned her head into the crook of Heart&#39;s neck. &quot;I&#39;m so glad I lost my 
virginity to you. I want to be in love with you forever.&quot; Saki licked Heart&#39;s hand free of 
her own cum. As if in surrender to each other, the girls kissed again. They locked tongues 
and cooed silently, as Heart tasted her lover. 

Both girls stood up and moved to the bed, not breaking the kiss. They slowly undressed each 
other until both girls wore nothing but their orange mini-skirts. They laid on their sides 
on the bed, facing each other. Saki cupped Heart&#39;s cheek and kissed her nose. Heart bit down 
on Saki&#39;s index finger nail, and suckled the finger. Heart plead with her chocolate eyes. 

Saki chuckled and moved in to kiss Heart. The pink Maiden sighed and cooed into Saki&#39;s 
mouth, as the newly-deflowered girl squirmed her tongue into her mouth. They rubbed their 
bare legs together, moaning, and pressed their chests together. Without breaking the kiss, 
Saki pushed Heart onto her back and mounted her, pressing herself further into Heart. Both 
girls moaned out as their sexes brushed against each other&#39;s legs, and their breasts and 
stomach slide together as they squirmed. Saki pinned Heart&#39;s hands down with her own, and 
locks fingers. Heart grinded against Saki, and wantonly moaned. She needed more. 

Saki happily obliged to the unspoken request. She broke the kiss, much to Heart&#39;s 
disappointment, and moved down. She traced butterfly kisses all over Heart&#39;s neck, 
shoulders, and collar. Heart sighed and gasped out as she wrapped her arms around Saki&#39;s 
back. Slowly, Saki made her was down to Heart&#39;s B-cup breasts. She kissed and licked all 
over each one, but never touching the nipple. Heart squirmed and begged as she pressed her 
chest into Saki&#39;s face. 

Saki sat up, pressed down on Heart&#39;s hands with her own, and chuckled. &quot;I&#39;m so glad that you 
love this.&quot; 

Saki then took Heart&#39;s nipple into her mouth and sucked hard. She pinched and rolled the 
other with her hand. Heart cried out and shook as Saki bit down slightly and rapidly flicked 
the erect nipple with her tongue. Kneaded and rolled her other breasts, and pulled slightly 
with her mouth. Saki then unlatched her mouth, and gave Heart&#39;s breast one long, slow lick, 
crossing over the nipple. Heart gasped out and arced into Saki. Her girlfriend then turned 
her mouth&#39;s attention to her other breast, licking and bite everywhere. Heart grew even 
wetter with each nibble, grinded herself into Saki&#39;s waist. Saki then bit down hard on the 
nipple and squeezed the other breast, causing Heart to scream in pain and pleasure. 

Saki chuckled, and decided to stop teasing. Still not taking her hand and mouth off of her 
lover, she moved to left. She moved her free left hand under the hem of Heart&#39;s skirt, 
causing the girl to shiver. Saki cupped Heart&#39;s bare sex, and she bucked and moaned. She 
traced a finger along the edge of Heart&#39;s cunt, causing her lover to squeak and shiver with 
eyes tightly shut. Still not taking her mouth off of the boob, Saki chuckled out how 
incredibly cute Heart&#39;s sex face was. 

As Saki began to play with the clit, Heart continued to squeak and moan through closed lips. 
It was like she was struggling to maintain dignity. Finally, with a hard pinch, Heart opened 
her mouth and let out a deafening cry. She continued to moan ass he felt electric pleasure. 
Saki continued to suckled and lick her breast, roll and pinched the other, and roughly 
played with her clit. Heart tilted her head back against her pillow and cried out. 

&quot;Aaaaah gods, Sakiiiiii... Maaaaake meeeee...&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; 

Saki sucked hard on a nipple, rolling the breast with her mouth, while she gave similar 
attention to the other breast with her hand, pinching and pulling roughly. She pinched and 
rubbed her clitoris harder and fast, making Heart squirm in erotic rotations. Heart couldn&#39;t 
hide her excitement as she screamed and flipped her hair in every direction. Saki continued 
to speed up her ministrations, loving every little cute little motion and sound Heart made. 

&quot;Aaaaaaa Saaaaaaakiiiiiii... Iiiiiaaaaaa, eeeeeee, I&#39;m gonna...&quot; 

&quot;Give me it. Give me your love.&quot; 

Saki bite down on as much of Heart&#39;s tit as she could, and squeezed the other extremely 
hard. She pinched and slightly twisted Heart&#39;s cute little clit, and this sent her over the 
edge. 

She screamed out. &quot;AAAAAAAAAAA I LOVE YOU SAAAAAKIIIII...&quot; 

&quot;I love you too.&quot; 

Heart arced her back and bucked hard as she came harder. She continued to shoot out cum for 
what seemed like minutes, while Saki did not slow her efforts at all. Her screams grew 
louder with each wave cum, and she thrashed about as she was drove ecstatic. Her pace 
gradually slowed as her pleasure began to subside. Her bucking slowed, until finally she 
relaxed on the bed, lost in the after glow. 

Saki cuddled next Heart, and gave her a kiss on the cheek and winked. She licked some of 
Heart&#39;s cum off of her hand as Heart watched in awe. &quot;Le... Let me have some.&quot; 

Heart took Saki&#39;s hand and wrapped her lips around a digit, sucking it dry. Saki was oddly 
stimulated by this, and watched as Heart licked her palm and backhand of her own cum. Heart 
then took Saki&#39;s wrist into both of her hands and smiled up at her. They locked their 
chocolate-colored eyes together. 
 
Heart then placed Saki&#39;s hand over her right breast. &quot;Can you feel it, Saki?&quot; Saki returned 
a puzzled look, and Heart only giggled slyly. &quot;I&#39;m beating for you. You really make me feel 
awesome, Saki. I&#39;m so thankful that you kissed me, and that we had our first time together. 
I want you to know that.&quot; 

Heart predatorily pushed Saki on her back, and kissed her. Saki moaned at the sudden 
contact, and wrapped her arms around Heart and pulled her in. They rubbed their bodies 
together, and exchanged sweat and juice. Saki moaned into Heart&#39;s mouth, while Heart focused 
on her attention to Saki. Heart grinded herself down into Saki, causing her girlfriend to 
gasp out and break the kiss. Saki was breathing hard through her mouth again, and locked 
eyes with Heart. 

Heart only grinned and licked Saki&#39;s jaw. She left a trial of saliva down Saki&#39;s neck and 
collar bone, and stopped at her hefty bosom. She suckled on some pale skin, and left a 
hiccie on her tit. Saki moaned loudly at sensations, as Heart moved her mouth and tongue 
over one breast, and massaged the other with her hand. Saki couldn&#39;t help but arc her back 
and cry out as Heart sucked and lick on and around her nipples. The pink girl quickly switch 
her mouth to the other breathe, leaving the other one attended by her hand. Saki continued 
to moan out squirm, already feeling another orgasm building, begging to be released. Her 
heart pumped, her skin was flushed, and she throbbed all over. It&#39;s like she was engulfed in 
pleasurable sensation, every touch driving her crazy. 

Heart suddenly took both breasts in her hands, and tried to stuff as much flesh as she could 
in her mouth, sucking and biting wildly. Saki cried out loudly and thrashed all over. She 
clutched Heart&#39;s pink bed sheets for dear life. Heart licked all over each breasts, covering 
them with saliva. She then suddenly took both of Saki&#39;s nipples into her mouth and sucked 
hard on them. Saki closed her eyes shut and cried out, more excited than ever. 

Heart then let go of her boobs. Saki was about to protest, but Heart then planted a wet kiss 
between Saki&#39;s cleavage. With her tongue, Heart made her wet way down Saki&#39;s chest. She 
reached her navel, and traced circles around her bellybutton. Saki&#39;s breathe hitched and 
ragged with each sensual motion. Finally, Heart made her way to the waistband of Saki&#39;s 
skirt. She looked up at Saki, who looked down, breathing hard in anticipation and 
excitement, and wink up at her. She pulled down her legs, threw it off the bed, and stared 
at Saki&#39;s wet cunt. 

&quot;H-Heart... D-Don&#39;t just look at it... Do it...&quot; 

Heart smiled at Saki. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s just so beautiful.&quot; Heart then went down on Saki 
and gave her lower lips a long, slow lap. 

Saki squeezed her eyes shut, arced her back, threw her head back, and screamed. Heart didn&#39;t 
stop, giving her another and another lick. Saki responded to each one with growing 
enthusiasm. Heart had to hold down her hips, as Saki thrash about and bucked, her breasts 
shaking erotically with her motions. Saki couldn&#39;t hold it in for much longer, and couldn&#39;t 
hide her pleasure. Heart started to quickly lick Saki&#39;s inner walls, mixing the juices with 
own saliva. Saki screamed to the heavens as Heart covered traced every inch of her insides 
with her tongue. Heart submerged her mouth completely, and thrust in and out with her 
tongue, giving her lower lips a French kiss. 

Saki shook and screamed. She could feel it build again in her womb. &quot;HEARRRRRRRT... I&#39;M...&quot; 
Her breasts were shaking and covered with sweat. Her chest heaved with every giant breathe 
and scream. She couldn&#39;t stop bucking her hips. Her back arced. Her hands clutched the 
sheets. Her legs shook. 

Heart took these cues, withdrew, and suck on Saki&#39;s clit, hard. Saki thrashed madly and 
screamed. Her world turned to pleasure. All that mattered was Heart and the pleasure she was 
giving her. Saki&#39;s clit still in Heart&#39;s mouth, she flicked it back and forth with her 
tongue, and rubbed it up and down. Saki let out orgasmic scream after scream after scream as 
she came. Heart held down Saki hips and drank from Saki&#39;s snatch as she bucked and came. Her 
head spinning, she grabbed Heart&#39;s hair, pressed her face into her cunt, and continued to 
cry out as she came into Heart&#39;s mouth. Her pace, screaming, and gushing gradually slowed 
until, finally she relaxed on the bed, let out a long coo, and release Heart&#39;s hair. 

Heart crawled up to Saki, and the girls wrapped their arms around each other before pressing 
together and kissing once again. Saki could taste herself in Heart&#39;s mouth, and licked 
Heart&#39;s mouth clean. As she pulled away, she noticed that she came all over Heart&#39;s face. 
She giggled and licked and sucked the cum off of her girlfriend&#39;s face. 

Heart then rested her forehead on her girlfriend&#39;s shoulder, whilst Saki stroked her pink 
hair. 

&quot;Saki, do you think this will change things?&quot; 

Saki hesitated for moment. &quot;Yes, it definitely will. But...&quot; 

&quot;Do you think we&#39;ll stay together?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sure we will. I love you too much to ever let you go.&quot; 

&quot;I hope we can stay together forever.&quot; 
 
&quot;Me too. I love you more than anybody.&quot; 

&quot;I love you too, Saki. I&#39;m so happy...&quot; Heart began to sob. Saki stroked Heart&#39;s back as she 
cried into her chest. &quot;I love you so much...&quot; Heart squeezed out inbetween sobs and hiccups. 
&quot;I&#39;m so glad we shared each other like this.&quot; Eventually the sobs slowed and stop. 

&quot;Will you really stay with me?&quot; 

&quot;Always.&quot; Tears still running down her face, Heart kissed Saki one last time, gently, 
slowly. Saki let out a single tear as she kissed Heart. They were going to live a new life 
together. She knew it. 

They released their kiss at last, and Heart cuddled into her lover and rested her head on 
the pillow with Saki. They soon fell asleep together, arms wrapped around each other. 

The spirits were now one. She made the two young women into her earthly vessel.
