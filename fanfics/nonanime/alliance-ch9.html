There are legends that walk among us, the people of Gotham know. A 
inhuman bat-creature that flaps in the darkness, or maybe just a man in 
a costume no one can be sure. The brightly clad Robin, shadowy Nightwing 
and many others haunted Gotham, but few learned about the true nature of 
their protectors.

Reporter Dani Grayton hurried down the street, her blonde hair flowing 
over her shoulders as she vaulted over a spilled trash can. Unlike some 
of the more famous TV personalities she dressed for comfort, including a 
sweatshirt, jeans and running shoes.

&quot;Damn he&#39;s fast,&quot; Dani muttered as she looked up at the black shape 
swinging across the sky. From here it was almost impossible to tell who 
the costume was, so the only thing she could do was try to keep up.

Soon she could hear a siren&#39;s wail as Dani rounded a corner, watching as 
a man was bodily pitched out a window. Pulling her recorder out from her 
pocket she quickly began to dictate the details that she&#39;d need for a 
story. She noted place, time and described the scene, then advanced with 
recorder in hand.

&quot;Uhhhh,&quot; the man groaned as she passed.

Dani pushed the device towards him optomistically as she asked, &quot;Excuse 
me, would you care to make a statement?&quot;

&quot;Urgh,&quot; he moaned, the brown haired man looking at her blearily, &quot;didn&#39;t 
do nuffin.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll make a note of that,&quot; Dani said as she pressed on.

Dani quickly identified the building as a jewelry store, and considering 
the time of night there was no legal reason for the men to be inside. 
Drawing out her camera she tried a shot, illuminating three men facing 
off against one... and losing.

The one man wore some kind of dark body suit, moving like a dancer as he 
cooly handled each attack, almost testing his foes. Then, having taken 
their measure he dropped them with frightening ease. Pulling a line from 
his belt he bound the men together them calmly dragged them out as he 
saw Dani standing there.

&#39;Not Batman,&#39; Dani noted as she took in the dark hair and the dark blue, 
light blue clothes, &#39;it&#39;s Nightwing.&#39; Clearing her throat she strode 
forward and said, &quot;Dani Grayton, Gotham Gazzette. Would you care to...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Nightwing strode by her, drawing a gun like device out and firing 
it into the sky, &quot;and I&#39;d suggest going home. It&#39;s not safe at night in 
Gotham.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Mr. Hero,&quot; Dani murmured as she turned off her recorder. 
Coolly she waited for the police to arrive, yawning tiredly. As she 
heard the first sirens near she thought, &#39;It&#39;s going to be a long 
night.&#39;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

With a groan Dani came awake, stretching out on her couch. The sunlight 
through thin clouds lit up the grungy city outside her window, a part of 
the town that had survived the quakes and no man&#39;s land. Getting up she 
shuffled by her desk to the coffee maker and switched it on, then 
stumbled to the door to get the paper.

Drinking her coffee and flipping through the pages Dani was satisfied 
that she&#39;d made page two this time. &quot;Hero says it&#39;s not safe at night!&quot; 
read the bold headline, with &quot;police refuse to comment&quot; just underneath 
it. With a satisfied smirk Dani cut out the article and pinned it up to 
the cork board covering the wall above her desk. On it were stories of 
the crazy and the outlandish from the two years she had been reporting 
iun this town, including the superhero stuff that she was so interested 
in.

After making herself some breakfast Dani hurried out the door in t-shirt 
and her usual jeans, ready for the world. Her first stop was the police 
department, where she ran into the typical run around. The desk 
sargeant, obviously having read her story, tried to stop her there then 
when that didn&#39;t work she was fobbed off to various officers. Finally, 
due to a combination of dogged persistance and luck, she got into see 
the Chief of police.

Commissioner James Gordon looked tough, maybe even weathered as he 
nodded greetings to Dani. Unlike some men who grow older and frail 
Gordon seemed to simply become tougher, like a well aged piece of 
leather. Even after returning to clean up Gotham Police Department he 
looked capable and ready to face whatever challenge may come.

&quot;Miss Grayton,&quot; Gordon nodded hello to her as he added mildly, &quot;you&#39;ve 
stirred up quite a hornet&#39;s nest.&quot;

Dani took a seat, smiling slightly as she answered, &quot;That&#39;s part of a 
reporter&#39;s job, Commissioner. Do you care to make a statement?&quot;

Gordon sat back in his chair, &quot;Miss Grayton, did you know that crime has 
actually been falling in Gotham?&quot;

That made Dani raise her eyebrows. &quot;You realize I find that hard to 
buy?&quot; she replied.

&quot;Look it up,&quot; Gordon said calmly. He frowned, &quot;The truth is, overall 
Gotham has less crime than the days of the mobs, but we have much more 
superhuman crime.&quot; He sighed, &quot;Which, as you know, is much louder and 
visible than regular crime.&quot;

&quot;I can agree with that,&quot; Dani conceded.

&quot;As to our city being safe at night?&quot; Gordon brought the interview 
around to her story, &quot;I&#39;d say we&#39;re no more dangerous than New York at 
night.&quot;

&quot;But not Metropolis or Keystone?&quot; Dani said with a teasing smile.

&quot;If we had Flash or Superman living here...&quot; Gordon shrugged.

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Dani agreed. She looked at him thoughtfully, &quot;Since your 
return a few months ago, I notice the Bat-signal has been restored to 
Gotham Central&#39;s roof. Is it there to play to the urban legend of the 
Batman, or is he real?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t answer that question,&quot; Gordon said as he checked his watch for 
show, &quot;as I have a pressing engagement.&quot;

&quot;Commish!&quot; Dani complained as she was ushered out.

&quot;Sorry young lady,&quot; Gordon&#39;s eyes twinkled with amusement as he grabbed 
his hat and coat, &quot;maybe next time.&quot;

Not long afterward, Dani found herself outside, walking towards the taxi 
stall. &quot;Private notes,&quot; she muttered into her recorder, &quot;the city&#39;s 
stance on Batman has varied over the years. For a while he was nearly a 
public figure, being given keys to the city and official sanction, but 
over time that changed. As the years passed the distance between him and 
the city has increased, and as far as I know he is no longer connected 
to the Police. And as his appearances have dropped so has the legend of 
the Batman changed, from well known hero to eerie urban legend some 
people no longer even believe in.&quot;

&quot;Hey miss!&quot; the taxi driver honked his horn to get her attention, &quot;You 
wanna ride or not?&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Dani climbed in, tossing her briefcase on the seat.

&quot;Were to?&quot; he asked in a surly way.

&quot;Gotham Gazette,&quot; Dani ordered, &quot;and don&#39;t take the long way around, or 
no tip.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; he flipped on the meter and they were off.

Sitting back in her seat Dani watched the city wizz buy. &quot;Better edit 
out the bit about legend of the Batman,&quot; she murmured to herself, &quot;it&#39;s 
kinda pretentious.&quot;

BOOM! Not far ahead of them the wall of a building exploded outwards as 
smoke poured out onto the street. The driver cursed as cars ahead jerked 
to a stop, swerving to avoid a suddenly parked car in the middle of the 
road.

&quot;Stop here,&quot; Dani yelled, tossing a generous amount of cash from her 
wallet to the driver and scrambling out the door. Running between parked 
cars she sought to get closer to the violence, her recorder at the 
ready.

Amid the chaos around Gotham Bank men in combat gear scurried out of the 
building carrying money, followed by a oddly aristocratic woman. The 
black haired lady flinched at the sunlight, even distorted through 
clouds and shouted, &quot;Hench!&quot;

The white haired older man with a unbrella hurried over, blocking the 
light as he said, &quot;Yes, Miss Noctura.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; the almost bone pale woman smiled politely. Addressing the 
men she said, &quot;Load up the truck, we haven&#39;t long until the police 
arrive.&quot;

Dani listened, crouching behind a car. Whispering into her recorder she 
narrated, &#39;The criminal mastermind appears to be Noctura, also known as 
Natalia Knight. Wonder if she&#39;s related to the Starman Knights?&quot;

&quot;Miss!&quot; a feminine voice called. Looking up Dani saw that Noctura had 
noticed her, and was gesturing for her to come closer.

&#39;Well, what do I have to lose?&#39; Dani thought as she rose from her hiding 
place. Briskly walking to Noctura&#39;s side she nodded politely, &quot;Dani 
Grayton, Gotham Gassette.&quot;

&quot;Miss Grayton,&quot; Noctura nodded, &quot;I&#39;ve read your works with interest.&quot;

&quot;Would you care to give an interview?&quot; Dani offered even as the goons 
hustled out more money and items from the Gotham Bank.

Noctura looked amused. &quot;You&#39;re not afraid I&#39;ll kill you?&quot; she asked.

Dani concentrated on keeping her cool. &quot;What would be the point?&quot; she 
wondered. A smile, &quot;If you intended to kill me you could have just had a 
henchman shoot me, but I think you&#39;re smarter than that.&quot;

Noctura looked amused. Her slinky dress swirling around her, &quot;It&#39;s true 
I usually let my associates do any killing...&quot;

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Dani agreed, watching as several figures moved into 
position. &quot;So, your statement is...?&quot; she asked, keeping her distracted.

&quot;If Gotham had a less expensive medical establishment,&quot; Noctura sniffed, 
&quot;I could get treatment for my skin disorder without resorting to such 
distasteful methods.&quot;

Just then a oddly faceless woman jumped one henchman, arrows pinned 
another to a wall and the orderly roberry descended into chaos. &quot;Oh 
dear,&quot; Hench noted, the attendant tugging on Noctura&#39;s arm, we&#39;d best 
go, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you want to finish your interview?&quot; Dani asked as the two 
criminals jumped into a fine sports car.

&quot;Later,&quot; Noctura smiled as she sped away.

Dani watched her go thoughtfully, &quot;Well that went well.&quot; Hurrying 
towards the fight she called, &quot;Can I get a comment?&quot;

As one the assembled heroes answered,. &quot;No!&quot;

&quot;Everyone&#39;s a critic,&quot; Dani sighed.

To be continued...

Notes: Dani is the granddaughter of a obscure Golden Age heroine called 
the Spider Widow.
