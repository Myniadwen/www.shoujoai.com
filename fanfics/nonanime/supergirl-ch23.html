&quot;Damn it, I want to be in Gotham,&quot; Kestrel angrily
protested, the black and purple clad heroine holding
on to Steel&#39;s back.

Oracle&#39;s voice was firm, &quot;You know that Raven can
handle it, Kestrel, we&#39;ve got the irregulars in Gotham
mobilized under her command.&quot; She paused a moment,
&quot;And I called in Catwoman, just like you suggested.&quot;

&quot;Finally broke down?&quot; Kestrel smiled slightly, but
Oracle didn&#39;t reply.

&quot;And I have to admit,&quot; B-ko commented as she checked
her helmet&#39;s heads up display, &quot;the situation in
Washington DC is possibly a bit more urgent.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Kestrel acknowledged as they passed the outer
city limits. &quot;All right,&quot; she sighed as she got down
to business, &quot;so who is this Vandal Savage, anyway?&quot;

&quot;A near immortal Vandal Savage has pursued his own
agenda for untold centuries,&quot; Oracle answered crisply.
&quot;He fought the JLA and JSA over the years, as well as
being a major player in several different global
crisis,&quot; she finished.

&quot;And now he&#39;s taken Washington,&quot; Steel added as
troopers opened fire on them, men and women dressed in
various different uniforms. She weaved through energy
fire smoothly, wrist cannon firing as she destroyed
transports.

Kestrel silently leapt into the center of the
attackers force, striking out smoothly and
effectively. &#39;Those are Kobra uniforms,&#39; she noted as
she fought on with a mix of speed and consummate
skill, &#39;warriors from the Demon&#39;s Head, Intergang
shock troops and even a few apes from Gorilla City.
How did he organize them all?&#39;

Not far above her Steel took out the heavy weapons,
her suit gleaming silver like some avenging angel.
They forged forward together, driving the enemy
backward as they fought through the streets. &quot;Wish
some of the others were available,&quot; B-ko muttered.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Oracle said apologetically, &quot;but Green
Lantern is dealing with Mongul&#39;s attempt to reactivate
the old Star Wars platforms and Flash is running
across the country trying to put out all of the small
fires.&quot;

&quot;And Mecha?&quot; Kestrel crisply asked as they pushed on
towards the capital building, knowing that they had a
deadline to meet.

&quot;ETA twenty seconds,&quot; Oracle said impishly, &quot;she&#39;ll
hit right on time.&quot;

Up on the podium in front of the capital building the
black haired man waved dramatically. &quot;This is our
time,&quot; Vandal Savage declared as he addressed his
followers, &quot;the failures end here! We will change the
world in ways that they could never imagine...&quot; He
trailed off, blinking as he saw a silvery object high
in the sky. &quot;What is that?&quot; he blinked.

THOOM!

The shockwave sent crooks flying, the coordinated
tactics that they had been using to slow Kestrel and
Steel breaking down in the chaos. Mecha rose from the
crater her landing had made, her skin gleaming and
undamaged.

&quot;Looks like the armor upgrades worked,&quot; Kestrel
remarked.

&#147;Overfire mode, activate,&#148; D-ko loudly declared.

The metal skin on her body peeled open as weapons
mounted on her arms popped up and then a cannon
sprouted out of each of her shoulders. D-ko&#146;s sculpted
ribs popped up and out to reveal missile racks, and
along each leg more of the missile racks were
revealed. From her eyes two red tracking beams
activated, swiftly targeting the dead center of the
enemy forces.

&quot;I would strongly advise surrender,&quot; Mecha said
crisply.

&quot;Leave the troops to her,&quot; Steel said crisply as she
saw Vandal Savage quickly flee the stage, &quot;we&#39;ve got
to get to him, first.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Kestrel agreed, the two of them following him
as he fled inside the Capital building itself, hearing
Mecha opening fire behind them.

The building was dark as they raced through the halls,
Kestrel on foot while Steel skimmed along above her.
&quot;Damn you,&quot; Savage threw a chunk of statue, clipping
Steel&#39;s helmet and sending her crashing to the floor.

&quot;Not today,&quot; Kestrel kicked out at him smoothly even
as she slipped a few gas capsules from her utility
belt. She slammed them into the ground even as a
simple mental command activated her cowl&#39;s built in
air filters.

The gas seemed to slow Savage down a moment and
Kestrel felt herself relax slightly... a fatal
mistake. Savage was on her in a moment, a large hand
wrapped around her throat as he bodily picked her up
off the floor. &quot;Prepare to die,&quot; he hissed as he began
to squeeze, then froze as something cold touched the
back of his head.

&quot;You know,&quot; Steel said as she held her arm cannon to
the back of Savage&#39;s head, &quot;I really don&#39;t consider
myself a hero, so if you don&#39;t let go of Kestrel right
now I will blow your head off.&quot;

Savage stood there a moment, weighing her words, then
he eased off and let Kestrel go. &quot;You know, I think I
believe you,&quot; he put his hands up in surrender.

Once Kestrel and Steel emerged with the captive Savage
the fight seemed to go out of the mob, the regular
police and military forces moving in to take control.
&quot;Did you mean what you said?&quot; Kestrel asked as they
watched from the sidelines.

&quot;Every word,&quot; Steel answered softly.

Kestrel moved close as she purred into Steel&#39;s ear,
&quot;Thank you, partner.&quot;

In the Watchtower mainframes Oracle smiled to herself
grimly. &#39;I don&#39;t think I realized that about Steel,&#39;
she thought. She worked swiftly, organizing data to
get a better feel of what was going on in other parts
of the world.

The Martian Manhunter calmly said, &quot;You don&#39;t need to
do this, Triumph.&quot;

The blonde haired man in golden armor glared at the
green Martian, his eyes glowing with pure madness. At
his feet an older woman lay, her face bloody from
multiple blows. &quot;You should understand, J&#39;onn,&quot;
Triumph hissed, the former hero&#39;s teeth pulled back in
a snarl, &quot;I have to make all my former partners pay.&quot;

&quot;And beating up Vixen will help?&quot; he asked, looking
down at the woman laying at his feet. Vixen had been a
JLAer once, a teammate and good friend, and it took
all of his will not to lash out at the madman with all
his power.

&quot;It&#39;s a start,&quot; Triumph shot back.

There was a sudden blur of motion but Triumph was
faster, raising a magnetic barrier to slam the Flash
back. His attention diverted J&#39;onn struck, slamming a
fist into the side of his head and sending the
forgotten hero crashing to the ground.

&quot;Oww,&quot; Flash pulled herself to her feet, shaking her
head slightly as she asked them, &quot;so what&#39;s his
problem, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Triumph was one of the earliest heroes,&quot; Vixen winced
as she was helped up, &quot;and led the first mission of
the JLA.&quot; Before Flash could protest she continued,
&quot;But a temporal event wiped him out of history and
trapped him in Limbo for years. He felt that he lost
out on the prestige and place in history he
deserved....&quot;

&quot;And it eventually drove him more than a little mad,&quot;
J&#39;onn finished.

Flash looked at the fallen Triumph, her expression a
mix of pity and disgust. &quot;So what did he mean, former
partners?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Triumph was a member of the JLA Task Force for a
short time,&quot; J&#39;onn said with a sigh, &quot;along with Vixen
and myself. It didn&#39;t end well.&quot;

&quot;I thought,&quot; Vixen visibly winced in pain as J&#39;onn
supported her, &quot;that he was supposed to be locked up
in the Fortress for life?&quot;

&quot;Considering that the Fortress is rubble right now,&quot;
Flash casually slung Triumph over her shoulder,. &quot;that
answers that.&quot; She touched the earpiece of her cowl as
she got a call from Oracle, &quot;Looks like things are
finally dying down.&quot;

&quot;Looks like you guys have things well in hand,&quot; Vixen
murmured to J&#39;onn with a wry smile.

&quot;We&#39;re trying,&quot; he answered. J&#39;onn activated his own
communicator and a frown appeared on his face. &quot;Many
of the major players are still missing,&quot; he reported
with a sigh, &quot;like Cyborg, Gog, Enchantress and
several others.&quot;

&quot;Which means we&#39;ll be dealing with them later on,&quot;
Flash agreed with a sigh of her own.

To be continued....

Author&#39;s Note: Triumph was introduced in the DC Comics
crossover Zero Hour, where his backstory was revealed.
He joined the JL Task Force when it was relaunched and
stayed on until the group disbanded. He reappeared in
the third JLA series as a villain, wielding a mystical
lightning bolt and battling against both the JLA and JSA.</pre>
