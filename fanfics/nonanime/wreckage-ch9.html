<h1>Avengers: Wreckage (part 9 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/wreckage-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Jackie Lucas briskly walked up to the gates of Stane
Enterprises, the black haired woman dressed in one of
her best business suits, a large carry bag at her side
holding her enchanted Asgardian mace, Thunderstrike.
Her rental car was parked in the secondary lot not far
away, the back seat and trunk both loaded with her
worldly possessions as she joyfully moved out of the
dive she had been living in.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Jackie nodded to the guard as she
passed over her new company identification card.

&quot;Miss Lucas,&quot; the brown haired young man nodded a
greeting as he scanned the card into the computer
system. &quot;All clear,&quot; the brown haired man smiled as he
hit the switch to open the gate, &quot;go on in.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jackie smiled back, walking at a brisk pace
up the lane towards the main set of office buildings.

Stane Enterprises was a busy complex, even this early
in the morning, with men and women hurrying about.
There was a set of warehouses to one side, where
crates of equipment were being off loaded, while a
group of young men and women carrying blue prints and
personal organizers cheerfully headed to work.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; Connie Leeds jogged up, the brown haired
woman falling into step beside her, &quot;you&#39;re early for
the meeting.&quot;

&quot;Thought it&#39;s be better to be early than late,&quot; Jackie
answered as they headed towards the main office tower.

&quot;And you&#39;re a little nervous,&quot; Connie said
perceptively, the personnel administrator looking
positively impish. .

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Jackie admitted, blushing a bit.

&quot;Don&#39;t be, nobody bites here,&quot; Connie said as they
went into the air-conditioned lobby. &quot;Hi May,&quot; she
waved to a black haired woman sitting at the front
desk.

&quot;Hi there,&quot; May smiled, her long hair held back by two
blue clips that nearly matched the color of her suit.
She gave Jackie a almost predatory look, &quot;Who&#39;s your
friend?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s new, down girl,&quot; Connie sounded amused. Turning
to Jackie she said, &quot;Meet May Scott, security and
unofficial staff Romeo.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; May protested indignantly, &quot;I&#39;m way better than
Romeo.&quot;

&quot;Whatever,&quot; Connie rolled her eyes jokingly.

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Jackie fought back a smile as she
offered May her hand.

&quot;Charmed, I&#39;m sure,&quot; May nearly purred as she held on
to Jackie&#39;s hand just a little longer than needed.

&quot;Let go, May,&quot; a clearly amused Connie said as she
tugged on Jackie&#39;s arm, &quot;we&#39;re on our way to a
meeting.&quot;

May sat back down at her desk as she called, &quot;I hope
I&#39;ll see you around.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s such a flirt,&quot; Connie sounded more amused than
anything else as they went into the elevator, the
doors closing with a soft hiss.

&quot;You don&#39;t seem too bothered by that,&quot; Jackie smiled
as they went up.

&quot;May is harmless,&quot; Connie waved it off. She looked up
at Jackie, &quot;Does it bother you? I can tell her to lay
off...&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s all right,&quot; Jackie blushed a bit as she
hesitantly admitted, &quot;I&#39;m actually kind of
complimented, I guess.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the spirit,&quot; Connie mock punched Jackie in the
shoulder then visibly winced. &quot;Owww,&quot; she cupped her
hand, &quot;you have muscles like iron under that suit!&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jackie sighed.

What Jackie didn&#39;t say was that her muscles were in
fact a side effect of her seemingly permanent
transformation to Thunderstike. She always seemed to
be in Asgardian form, in disguise or not, and her body
was pure sculpted muscle. It was something Jackie was
still trying to get used to, even months after her
initial change.

&quot;I&#39;m kinda curious to see what you look like under the
business wear,&quot; Connie admitted as the elevator
stopped and the doors opened.

&quot;Ah...&quot; Jackie started, not entirely sure what to say
to that.

Connie winked, &quot;Just kidding.&quot; They headed out with
her leading the way, &quot;The meeting&#39;s just down the hall
here.&quot;

&quot;So, have you been working here long?&quot; Jackie asked.

&quot;Nearly a year,&quot; Connie said cheerfully, &quot;I was one of
Olivia&#39;s first recruits, then I helped her head-hunt
the staff she wanted.&quot;

&quot;She sounds like a very capable woman,&quot; Jackie noted
as they reached a door.

&quot;Oh, she is,&quot; Connie agreed as she knocked on the door
with her knuckles. &quot;Hey, it&#39;s open,&quot; she pushed, the
door swung in and...

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Jackie quickly grabbed the door handle and
pulled it shut again before they got a even better
view of what Olivia Stane and Jennifer Swensen were
doing there on top of the board room table.

&quot;Guess we&#39;re a little too early,&quot; Connie noted,
apparently entirely unbothered by what they had just
seen.

&quot;Oh god,&quot; Jackie fought back a blush, rubbing at her
face.

&quot;Want to go get a coffee?&quot; Connie offered, &quot;It&#39;ll give
them a chance to, ah, finish up.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re taking this awfully calmly,&quot; Jackie sighed as
they headed down the hall, presumedly to go to a
cafeteria.

&quot;They&#39;re sort of in the newlywed stage,&quot; Connie said
impishly, &quot;while it doesn&#39;t happen often they have had
a few such... incidents.&quot;

&quot;That had to have been interesting.&quot;

Meanwhile, back in the boardroom a fiercely blushing
Jennifer was pulling up her skirt as she said, &quot;I
though you said we had time?&quot;

Olivia hopped down from where she was sitting on the
table, the nearly white blonde haired woman doing up
her blouse, &quot;We should have.&quot; She made a face, &quot;I
guess Jackie got here early and Connie brought her
up.&quot;

&quot;Remind me to give Connie some grief for that,&quot;
Jennifer said, the redhead typing up her clothes as
much as possible.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have started something here,&quot; Olivia
admitted wryly. She strightened her clothes then
brushed at her hair, &quot;How do I look?&quot;

&quot;Beautiful,&quot; Jennifer smiled slightly.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Olivia smiled back, &quot;though it was
comments like that, that got us into this mess in the
first place.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Jennifer chuckled softly.

Once she looked reasonably presentable Olivia asked,
&quot;Should we go look for them?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, because if we stay in here alone we&#39;re probably
going to get in trouble again,&quot; Jennifer said with
some amusement.

&quot;I can think of worse things,&quot; Olivia said. After a
fast pit stop in the ladies bathroom to clean up and a
fast mirror check, both women set out looking for the
other pair.

&quot;You even have Starbucks here?&quot; Jackie said in
surprise as they collected their coffees and sat at a
table by the window. The cafeteria was styled more
like a restaurant, with nice tables, indirect lighting
and plush carpet from wall to wall.

&quot;Only the best for our staff,&quot; Connie said cheerfully.

Jackie munched on a breakfast sandwich and blinked, &quot;I
see what you mean.&quot;

&quot;Try the eggs one time,&quot; Connie winked, &quot;they&#39;re to
die for.&quot;

&quot;The meeting today,&quot; Jackie dropped her voice, &quot;what&#39;s
it about?&quot;

&quot;I really shouldn&#39;t tell you,&quot; Connie looked down at
her cup, stirring her coffee.

&quot;I&#39;m nervous enough about all this as it is,&quot; Jackie
said, abandoning her bravado a moment and letting her
nerves show through.

Connie gave her a sympathetic look, &quot;It&#39;s nothing too
bad.&quot;

&quot;No, not at all,&quot; Olivia said as she and Jennifer
walked up to the table.

&quot;Nice to see you, boss,&quot; Connie smiled. Her expression
became wicked, &quot;Or is it, nice to see less of you?&quot;

&quot;We got distracted,&quot; Jennifer conceded as she grabbed
two chairs and pulled them over to Connie and Jackie&#39;s
table.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry that we...&quot; Jackie started.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Olivia waved it off. &quot;What I
intended to talk about was the planned media push
we&#39;ll be doing for the team,&quot; she said, &quot;we&#39;d like you
to participate in it.&quot;

Jackie puffed out a breath, &quot;As long as I have Warbird
and War Machine backing me up.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll be there,&quot; Olivia nodded.

&quot;I&#39;m going to ask Danvers to coach us on interviews,
too,&quot; Jennifer added,

&quot;Maybe give her a exclusive, too,&quot; Connie suggested.

&quot;Not a bad idea,&quot; Olivia agreed.</pre>
