<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The sun was shining, the breeze was gentle, and the beaches were white 
after last night&#39;s sudden rain storm. And the X-Men were taking a well 
deserved day off.

It all started in the living room, where Rogue, Kitty and Elizabeth 
had just returned from their morning work out. Elizabeth had flopped 
down in a chair and groaned softly.

Rogue walked into the kitchen, grumbling under her breath about crazy 
ladies who felt the need to beat each other up so damn early in the 
morning. Kitty, of course, was bright eyed and bushy tailed, gaining a 
glare from almost everyone just getting up.

&quot;God, the beach was nice this morning,&quot; Kitty said with a happy sigh. 
She looked thoughtful, &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t we all go down to the beach, 
today?&quot;

Elizabeth waved a hand weakly, &quot;She&#39;s probably just looking for 
someone different to beat up today.&quot; With a theatrical groan, she 
cried, &quot;Don&#39;t do it!&quot;

Neal laughed softly, standing behind Elizabeth and gently rubbing her 
shoulders. She closed her eyes and gave a soft sigh of contentment.

Rogue was frowning a bit, &quot;You know, we really haven&#39;t taken advantage 
of the closeness of the beach. I agree with Pryde, let&#39;s hit the 
beach!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not a bad idea,&quot; Ororo admitted, &quot;we could certainly use a 
break.&quot; Raven had been silently sipping her coffee so far, so she 
asked her, &quot;Would you like to come along?&quot;

Raven looked a bit startled to be asked, &quot;Yes, if no one minds.&quot;

Rogue grinned suddenly, &quot;Can I pick out your swimsuit?&quot;

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Raven quickly said. She got some inquiring looks from the 
other X-men, and with a soft laugh she elaborated, &quot;Last time I let 
her do that she put me in a thong bikini, for gods sake!&quot;

&quot;I bet you looked good in it,&quot; Ororo said with a mysterious little 
smile. She noticed Sage stumbling in, hair sticking up and dressed in 
her pajamas, and added, &quot;By the way Sage, you&#39;re going to the beach 
with us, too.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Sage answered, nearly dropping her coffee cup.

&quot;You could use the sun,&quot; Bishop noted with a grin. He was dressed to 
go, &quot;Sorry I can&#39;t tag along, but I&#39;ve got to keep an appointment with 
the police department.&quot;

&quot;Did somebody catch you?&quot; Neal said with a little smile.

&quot;No, nobody caught me,&quot; Bishop said, rolling his eyes, &quot;I&#39;m setting up 
a new cover identity as Lucas Bishop, Interpol officer. I&#39;ll have to 
see you all sometime this evening.&quot; He headed off, and the other X-men 
split up to start getting ready.



Raven Darkholme smiled slightly, laying down on the beach, the sun 
beating down on her. Her brown hair swept past her shoulders, stylish 
sunglasses concealed her eyes and her skin was already lightly tanned. 
She noticed the admiring glances of several men and woman passing by, 
but there was only one person she really wanted to get the attention 
of.

The bikini Ororo was wearing was legal, but only just barely. Pure 
black, it was a daring number, consisting of a skimpy top and bottom 
that anyone with any body modesty at all would avoid like the plague. 
It was obviously a weapon of the seduction variety, and poor Kitty was 
still blushing a bit, just looking at her.

&quot;When are they going to do something?&quot; Kitty asked Rogue in a 
irritated tone of voice. She continued, &quot;They&#39;ve been dancing around 
each other all week.&quot;

Rogue turned over so that her back was exposed to the sun. &quot;Could you 
put some lotion on me, honey?&quot; Rogue asked Kitty sweetly, trying to 
distract her from the topic.

The little bikini Rogue was wearing left her bottom mostly exposed to 
Kitty&#39;s suddenly eager gaze. &quot;Sure,&quot; Kitty said softly, rubbing some 
lotion between her hands and then going to work on Rogue&#39;s backside, 
thoroughly protecting it from the sun.

Watching this, Elizabeth chuckled softly, even as Neal lotioned her 
back, too. She hissed loudly, as Neal pressed down on her side a bit 
too hard.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Neal apologized, &quot;was that another bruise?&quot; Elizabeth nodded 
wearily, and Neal remarked, &quot;Kitty must be a harsh taskmaster.&quot;

&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Elizabeth softly sighed. &quot;It&#39;s even scarier to 
realize that she was holding back on the first day she trained me,&quot; 
she said with a wry smile.

Neal shook his head, wondering if his girlfriend had some kind of 
masochistic streak. He had watched one of their training sessions, and 
it had seemed quite simple. Kitty demonstrated a move, and then she 
asked Elizabeth to use it. If she got it right, Kitty ended up on the 
ground. If she got it wrong, Elizabeth usually ended up on the ground 
instead. It certainly seemed to help her remember the next time, but 
still...

Sage watched the group silently, laying back in her one-piece suit, 
her black sunglasses completely concealing her watching eyes. Her mind 
worked tirelessly, sorting, analyzing, even as she relaxed under the 
warm rays of the sun.

&quot;You should really be mingling more with the others,&quot; Ororo said, 
taking a moment to kneel down beside the dark hared woman.

&quot;And you should probably be over talking to Raven,&quot; Sage answered her 
with a little smile. She noted with some amusement that is was 
possible to see Ororo blush, if you were attentive enough. Changing 
the subject, Sage quietly said, &quot;I was reading through our volume of 
Destiny&#39;s Diary, and I&#39;ve noticed some irregularities.&quot;

Instantly back in business mode, Storm asked &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;There are differences between what&#39;s been happening in the real world 
and what&#39;s written down in the Diary,&quot; Sage said very quietly, so that 
the other X-men couldn&#39;t hear them. She added calmly, &quot;It&#39;s not a 
large difference just yet, but I do suspect that it will grow over 
time.&quot;

&quot;How is that possible?&quot; Storm asked. Frowning fiercely she asked, &quot;I 
thought Destiny&#39;s power was to see the future?&quot;

&quot;A most probable future,&quot; Sage corrected her, &quot;but improbable things 
can happen, sometimes. Something you might never be able to predict.&quot;

&quot;So something improbable happened, creating a divergence from what 
Destiny predicted,&quot; Storm said softly. Sage just nodded a bit in 
reply. &quot;You know what the divergence is, don&#39;t you?&quot; Storm said more 
than asked.

&quot;Them,&quot; Sage said, nodding to where Kitty and Rogue lay, &quot;there&#39;s no 
mention of them being together in the Diary at all.&quot; She finished 
softly, &quot;Any event predicted in the diaries involving us or Rogue is 
now up for grabs.&quot;

&quot;But our enemies don&#39;t know that yet,&quot; Storm finished.

&quot;They&#39;ll continue to go after the Diaries,&quot; Sage agreed, &quot;and some of 
the predictions in them will still be valid. Just not all.&quot;

Storm nodded. &quot;Nothing we can do about it today,&quot; she said, sighing 
softly, &quot;but we&#39;ll have to keep it in mind.&quot; With a small smile she 
admitted, &quot;Personally, I rather like being free of prophecy.&quot;

A young woman jogged up the beach towards them, her long blond hair 
swinging around her. She was obviously athletic, and wore the swimsuit 
of a lifeguard. &quot;Have either of you seen a ten year old boy?&quot; she 
quickly asked them.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but no,&quot; Ororo answered, looking around them for a moment 
curiously Gazing out over the water, her eyes widened as she saw 
something in the distance. &quot;Is that someone out there?&quot; she asked her, 
pointing.

The blond turned, her eyes narrowed, and she cursed softly. She ran to 
the water, diving in and swimming out with a smooth, well practiced 
motion. As she swam, she began to glow softly.

Sage&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;She&#39;s changing,&quot; she said softly to Storm, 
&quot;adapting to the water!&quot;

Storm frowned, she hated just standing here watching, but using her 
weather powers in a situation like this could make things much, much 
worse. She pointed to another figure swimming to the boy, &quot;Who&#39;s that 
out there?&quot;

Raven willed herself to change, letting her body become slick, cutting 
through the water smoothly. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this,&quot; she 
grumbled to herself. But she still swam onward, finally reaching the 
boy&#39;s side. He flailed around wildly, but she managed to get a grip on 
him.

He seemed a bit startled at her blue colored skin, so she willed 
herself to a more human form. Keeping his head above the water, she 
calmed him down even as she saw a flash of gold approaching her. The 
blonde came up by Raven, trading water with a little smile on her 
face. Before either of them could say anything, the were swamped by a 
massive wave.

The lifeguard&#39;s body blazed golden a moment, then she pulled them all 
from the water on golden wings. Raven gaped at her a moment, then 
managed, &quot;I&#39;m impressed.&quot;

They reached the shore in seconds, descending into the X-Men&#39;s midst. 
&quot;Mom, you all right?&quot; Rogue cried out, running to Raven&#39;s side.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Raven assured her, then she turned to the lifeguard, &quot;Is 
he all right?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s fine,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;That was a good job, by the way. 
My name&#39;s Heather Cameron,&quot; she said, offering her hand to her.

&quot;Raven Darkholme,&quot; she said, taking the hand and shaking it. Ororo 
looked at her, her eyes full of questions, and Raven shrugged at her 
eloquently. She had no idea why she did it either.

The young boy was quickly claimed by a frantic mother, but not before 
he softly thanked Raven and Heather for what they had done. Raven 
blushed, stammered, and in no way did she look like the former evil 
mutant she was.

They gathered up the beach a bit to talk. &quot;You&#39;re a mutant, are you 
not?&quot; Ororo quietly asked Heather, curious to hear what her answer 
might be. And wondering if she had met another new recruit already.

&quot;I&#39;m just Lifeguard,&quot; she answered Ororo simply, &quot;whatever ability or 
form I need to save someone&#39;s life, I can somehow gain.&quot;

The introductions quickly began, and Kitty noticed something rather 
odd. Sage seemed to hang back shyly from the tall blond woman. Kitty 
stepped up behind her, and when the time was right, gave her a firm 
shove.

Sage stumbled, falling forward against Heather, who gently caught her. 
She smiled down at Sage gently, helping her straighten up before 
asking her &quot;And what&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m called Sage,&quot; she answered her softly. Heather gently tugged down 
on Sage&#39;s sunglasses, revealing her dark eyes.

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, Sage,&quot; Heather said to her with a small smile.
