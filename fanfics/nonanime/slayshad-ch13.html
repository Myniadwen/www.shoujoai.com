<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Tara frowned slightly, the brown haired woman cleaning out a glass as 
she carefully studied the young man standing before her. He didn&#39;t seem 
dangerous, somehow, but there still was an odd chill in her bones 
whenever she had to deal with him. &quot;All right, Jonothan,&quot; she finally 
said, &quot;I&#39;ll hold your tab but pay it off soon.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jonothan smiled, &quot;I&#39;ll do my best.&quot; With that the brown haired 
young man left, weaving through the crowd at the Bronze.

&#39;I wish I knew why I dislike him,&#39; Tara thought with a frown.

It was a busy night at the bar, young men and woman getting plenty of 
drinks and food as they talked away at the many cozy tables. The Bronze 
was popular both for the good food and for it&#39;s reputation. After Tara 
took over incidents of vampire attacks dropped like a brick, as well as 
any other form of supernatural danger.

&#39;It tells you something about Sunnydale,&#39; Tara mused as she poured a 
drink for Clem then shooed him off, &#39;that a bar would be better known 
for people not getting killed.&#39;

There was a murmur in the customers, a mix of fear and respect as a 
group made their way up to the bar. Willow lead the way, the leather 
clad vampiress moving with a dark sort of grace. Buffy strode beside 
her, the blonde having an animal power about her that was nearly as 
intimidating as Willow&#39;s vampiric nature.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Dawn looked around her wide eyed, her long brown hair flowing 
around her.

&quot;Isn&#39;t she underage?&quot; Tara asked with a smile.

&quot;She&#39;s also with us,&quot; Buffy answered smoothly then held up her fingers 
in a Girl Scout-like salute, &quot;and I promise to keep her away from any of 
the booze.&quot;

&quot;But Buffy....&quot; Dawn complained.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Tara nodded slightly, &quot;but keep an eye on her.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Willow answered with a ghost of a smile.

Tara bit back her first response, a sarcastic comback that wouldn&#39;t do 
anyone any good. She still didn&#39;t trust the vampire with a soul, no 
matter what the other&#39;s said. &quot;Don&#39;t bite the customers,&quot; Tara said that 
coldly to Willow.

&quot;Tara,&quot; Buffy frowned.

&quot;Let it go, love,&quot; Willow put her hand on Buffy&#39;s shoulder, meeting 
Tara&#39;s gaze calmly. &quot;Could you send a pop, blood and beer over to our 
table?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Right,&quot; Tara nodded as they slipped away. She got their order ready and 
waved a waitress over, &quot;Hey, Harmony!&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; the blonde beamed as she picked up the tray. Harmony was a 
bit flighty but she was a good worker as long as she kept an eye on her.

&quot;Over there,&quot; Tara nodded towards the table the three sat at, &quot;and keep 
an eye out for the redhead, she bites.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Harmony bounced off with a smile.

&#39;Too bad she thinks I&#39;m just joking,&#39; Tara thought with a slight shake 
of her head. There was a disturbance near the enterance and she looked 
up, eyes narrowed in concern, then her face relaxed into a welcoming 
smile.

Faith walked through the crowds easily, people shifting aside as she 
came. The black haired woman had a dangerous presence similar to that of 
Buffy, a sense of unleashed potential. The tight jeans and leather 
jacket also helped, giving her the look of a rebel. Any unwary enough to 
aproach her were scared off by the deadly glares she delivered.

&quot;Hey, Tara,&quot; Faith&#39;s face was gentled by her smile as she reached the 
bar.

&quot;Good to see you,&quot; Tara answered, realizing that she meant the simple 
courtesy. It felt good being here with Faith, the two of them, spending 
time together.

&quot;Looking good,&quot; Faith grinned.

Tara blushed slightly as she tugged at the tight white t-shirt she wore 
tucked into blue jeans, meeting Faith&#39;s amused look. &quot;It&#39;s just 
comfortable,&quot; she said, trying to look casual.

Faith chuckled softly. She pushed her black hair back as she said, 
&quot;Sorry to say I had to bring the chaperones along.&quot;

Tara looked around curiously then frowned slightly as she saw Rupert 
Giles sitting at one of the side tables. Her eyebrows went up in 
surprise when she realized her mentor Jenny Calendar was sitting across 
from him, the two bending forward to talk intimately.

&quot;They&#39;re seeing each other...?&quot; Tara blinked.

&quot;G-man says they&#39;re just friends,&quot; Faith said with an impish little 
smile, &quot;but that&#39;s not the vibe I get from them.&quot;

Tara nodded thoughtfully even as sdhe drew a glass of beer and passed it 
to Faith. &quot;If Jenny is his friend I may have to reassess him,&quot; she 
admitted.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Faith took the beer, taking a deep drink. She wiped her mouth 
with the back of her hand as she said, &quot;G&#39;s not so bad, or maybe it&#39;s 
beter to say he&#39;s bad in a good way.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Tara looked curious.

&quot;Called up my old Watcher and blackmailed him into looking up G-man&#39;s 
file,&quot; Faith drawled, &quot;turns out he was not a nice young man. Was into 
the punk scene and dabbled in chaos magic.&quot; She grinned, &quot;He even had a 
nickname.&quot;

&quot;And what was that?&quot; Tara asked with a little smile.

&quot;Ripper,&quot; Faith said. She looked over at the conservative Englishman and 
murmured, &quot;Can you even imagine him fitting that name?&quot;

Tara looked thoughtful a moment. &quot;You know, maybe,&quot; she finally answered 
quietly, &quot;I think there&#39;s a strong core to him.&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Faith took another drink of her beer, &quot;you could be right.&quot; 
She set her mug down with a thump then Faith studied her intently with 
those dark eyes.

&quot;What?&quot; Tara asked, looking down into eyes that were like pools of dark 
water, concealing such hidden depths.

&quot;What are you doing after work?&quot; Faith asked, leaning up against the 
bar.

&quot;Nothing, really,&quot; Tara looked confused as she continued, &quot;why?&quot;

&quot;Because I&#39;m asking you out on a date,&quot; Faith said simply. She flashed a 
smile, &quot;Being subtle and waiting for you to get the idea wasn&#39;t working 
so I thought I&#39;d ask.&quot;

&quot;I....&quot; Tara trailed off, a blush appearing on her cheeks. She wanted to 
turn her down, to say no but somehow she just couldn&#39;t seem to do it.

Faith waited a moment then sighed. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she gave Tara a surprisingly 
gentle smile, &quot;guess I got my signals crossed. Just forget I said 
anything, okay?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Tara started then said, &quot;I mean, yes.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Faith looked at her curiously, seeming surprisingly vulnerable 
standing there in the dim light of the Bronze.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Tara took a deep breath, &quot;I&#39;d like to go out on a date with you.&quot;

Over in the corner a quiet conversation was continuing. &quot;I wonder what 
they&#39;re talking about?&quot; Rupert Giles asked as they both felt Tara and 
Faith&#39;s gazes falling on them.

&quot;Probably about us,&quot; Jenny Calendar chuckled softly. The brown haired 
woman reached for the bottle of wine and topped up each of their cups.

&quot;You&#39;re kidding,&quot; Giles frowned.

&quot;They&#39;re seeing two apparently middle aged adults sharing a night out 
together,&quot; Jenny pointed out, &quot;adults both of them know. Of course 
they&#39;re talking about us.&quot;

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Giles sighed.

Jenny smirked. &quot;It could be worse,&quot; she nodded to another table where 
Willow, Buffy and Dawn were sitting, &quot;they haven&#39;t noticed us yet.&quot;

&quot;Thank god,&quot; Giles muttered. He ran a hand through his short brown hair, 
&quot;Anyway I&#39;m glad you decided to go out with me tonight.&quot;

&quot;Just as long as we don&#39;t talk shop,&quot; Jenny cautioned him, &quot;no 
witchcraft or vampire slaying tonight. Just two adults, wine and 
pleasant conversation.&quot;

Giles took a drink, smiling back warmly, &quot;I think I&#39;d like that.&quot;</pre>
