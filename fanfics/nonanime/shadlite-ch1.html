<h1>Shadows and Light</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The pretty black haired announcer moved across the stage as she 
continued, &quot;Sadly, many of the heroes called the Minutemen came to bad 
ends.&quot; Pictures of costumed heroes flashed behind her as she narrated, 
&quot;Dollar Bill was shot and killed stopping a bank robbery, Mothman fell 
into alcoholism and suffered a mental breakdown, Captain Metropolis was 
decapitated in a car crash, Hooded Justice was murdered, the original 
Nite Owl was beaten to death in his home and Silhouette was expelled 
from the team, outed as a lesbian and killed by a former foe.&quot;

A noted psychiatrist took a turn as he puffed on his water pipe, &quot;It 
should be noted that many heroes of the past were unstable 
personalities.&quot; He gestured, his brown and grey hair shining, &quot;Just look 
at the Comedian! He was a killer on government payroll, controlled as 
much for our safety as anyone else.&quot;

&quot;So you think superheroes may be insane?&quot; the hostess asked.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go that far Ms. Lincon,&quot; the psychiatrist smiled charmingly, 
&quot;but just look at Silhouette&#39;s lifestyle!&quot;

Amy Lincon kept her professional smile in place as she pointed out, 
&quot;Doctor, you know homosexuality is no longer considered a mental 
illness....&quot;

The show ran down as the hour finished, Amy giving her final monologue 
and the studio audience applauding politely on cue. As the &#39;off air&#39; 
sign lit up Amy puffed out a sigh of relief as the noted psychiatrist 
hopped up, stomping off the set with a decidedly unpleasant look on his 
usually handsome face.

Jessie the makeup girl had Amy in her seat, carefully removing the extra 
makeup that helped bring out her color under the harsh lights of the 
studio. &quot;You know,&quot; the sandy blonde noted, &quot;I don&#39;t think he liked you 
contradicting him.&quot;

&quot;If he&#39;s going to trot out sexuality as a sign of superhero insanity,&quot; 
Amy shrugged as much as she could in the makeup chair, &quot;he&#39;d better be 
prepared for people to take shots at him.&quot; She chuckled, &quot;Not that 
running around in skin tight outfits isn&#39;t kinky, but....&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Jesse agreed as she finished removing the foundation with 
cold cream. &quot;Do you want me to...?&quot; she gestured to the makeup case.

&quot;No, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Amy chuckled as she took off the smock covering her fine 
job clothes and sat up. &#39;Besides,&#39; she thought with a sigh, &#39;you&#39;re too 
damn cute. Just having you touch my face can get me going....&#39;

&quot;One day you gotta let me do your face,&quot; Jesse said with a smile, &quot;I bet 
you&#39;d look even better than on set.&quot;

Amy shook her head, &quot;Sorry, Jesse.&quot; As she stretched she said, &quot;I find 
skipping makeup helps me avoid being recognized.&quot; She stripped off her 
fancy dress, standing in just bra and panties as she pulled on a simple 
black dress, digging a black out of her closet,

&quot;True enough,&quot; Jesse agreed, her eyes lingering on her shapely body as 
Amy changed. She waved as the newswoman drew a jacket around her, &quot;Stay 
safe.&quot;

&quot;Always,&quot; Amy agreed as she headed out into the night, wishing that 
Jesse would make a move on her. &#39;Maybe she doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m not 
straight?&#39; she wondered.

New York had changed a great deal in the aftermath of the alien attack 
that had killed most of the city and devastated Times Square. The 
population had plummeted like a rock compared to the pre-attack era and 
was only now rising back up. The city was safer, arguably, but eerily 
deserted at times which made people nervous.

Amy kept a eye out as she walked, her long coat flowing around her legs.

Making things even odder was the return of the costumed vigilantes. The 
notorious Rorschach was cutting a swath through the bad side of town, 
going after the foot-soldiers of organized crime while the second Nite 
Owl and a mysterious woman in leather were tearing through the high 
class clubs and fronts of the mob.

&#39;I wonder if I should do a follow up story to tonight&#39;s episode?&#39; Amy 
mused. &#39;Looking at the modern successors, maybe?&#39;

There was a eerie quiet on the street as Amy neared Time&#39;s Square, 
pausing in a intersection to look over the empty streets. Once upon a 
time it had bustled twenty four hours a day but now it was quiet at 
night, the only businesses willing to move back in being mob backed or 
at least slightly shady.

Suddenly a explosion rang out as the front of a building blew out! 
Yelling and alarms rang as two figures burst from the building, one of 
them sporting a short cape that swirled in the wind. Beside him a woman 
in black leather armor punched a man out as she drew a pistol, putting a 
bullet through a charging mobster&#39;s leg.

&#39;That&#39;s got to be Nite Owl,&#39; Amy thought as she whipped her digital 
camera out and began to take shots, &#39;but who&#39;s the sexy lady?&#39;

The woman turned, revealing a partial face mask that revealed brown eyes 
that seemed to zap Amy where she stood. &quot;Don&#39;t look now, Nite Owl,&quot; the 
woman smiled, &quot;looks like we&#39;ve got a little company.&quot;

&quot;Right, Silk Spectre,&quot; Nite Owl agreed as he finished punching out 
another probable gangster. With a touch of his wrist a flying machine 
descended from the sky on thrusters and a ladder deployed, both heroes 
swiftly climbing aboard.

&quot;Make sure you get the owl-ship&#39;s good side!&quot; Silk Spectre joked as they 
disappeared inside and vanished into a cloudy sky.

&quot;Oh my...,&quot; Amy managed to get out as she watched in awe, barely 
remembering to snap a few more photos as they disappeared.

It was all over the news next day, and Amy&#39;s photos were on the front 
pages. Her boss at the studio threatened to issue her a video camera, he 
was so envious of the story she got, and it helped that she was able to 
write up the feature for the papers, too. Of course, each had it&#39;s own 
slant; the Times being very pro law and order they opposed the 
vigilantes, the Globe supported them and the New Frontier wanted them to 
burn down more crime dens.

&quot;So,&quot; Arthur Griffin said as they sat in the office at the TV studio, 
her boss looking at her thoughtfully, &quot;you want to do a story on the 
Watchmen?&quot;

&quot;Obviously,&quot; Amy nodded eagerly, &quot;it seems like the thing to do, too.&quot;

Arthur leaned forward, his hair still anchor-man stylish even though 
it&#39;d been years since he&#39;d appeared on camera. &quot;But what&#39;s your angle?&quot; 
he asked intensely, &quot;You know everyone and his dog are jumping on the 
story as we speak.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Amy admitted, frowning. She had a edge as the first reporter 
on the scene but every major and minor TV station in the city was 
chasing the story on the return of superheroes. Unless she could come up 
with something unique....

Arthur looked at her in surprise, &quot;You have the oddest look on your 
face.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;ve got an idea,&quot; Amy breathed out, her mind already racing as 
she considered the details of her plan.

&quot;What?&quot; Arthur asked, not sure he liked the look in her eyes.

Amy leaned over, her eyes twinkling as she said, &quot;What if... the station 
had it&#39;s own, official costumed hero?!&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;Why pick Silhouette?&quot; Jesse asked curiously as she helped apply a bit 
of spirit gum to hold the mask in place.

&quot;I always felt she got a bit of a bad rap,&quot; Amy answered as she adjusted 
the black gloves she wore. She smiled, &quot;And besides, we share... similar 
interests.&quot;

Jesse grinned as she asked teasingly, &quot;Then the rumors about you and 
that cute little production assistant are true?&quot;

Amy blushed as Jesse smoothed the mask on, &quot;We were just friends, 
thanks. Besides, she wasn&#39;t my type.&quot;

Jesse was tempted to ask what her type was, but she knew it might not be 
such a good idea. &quot;Why don&#39;t you try moving?&quot; she asked, &quot;Let&#39;s see how 
well the costume works.&quot;

Amy got up, the slick black bodysuit hugging her body from the neck down 
to her boots. She kicked to the side, feeling the material stretch but 
not rip as it was designed to. Even better it was a advanced material 
intended for the police and military, providing a reasonable defense 
against blades and light handguns.

&#39;Better make sure I dodge,&#39; Amy thought as she stretched, feeling 
Jesse&#39;s eyes resting on her. &quot;Jesse?&quot; she asked as she turned, glad the 
sports bra she wore made her breasts stand up under the tight cloth.

&quot;Y... yes?&quot; Jesse stammered, the blonde blushing faintly.

Amy stalked towards her as she purred, &quot;How do I look?&quot;

Jesse seemed frozen as Amy stood in front of her sexily, a dangerous 
look in her eye. &quot;You look gorgeous,&quot; she admitted a bit breathlessly.

Amy reached out to caress her cheek, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She gave a slow, 
teasing smile as she said, &quot;You didn&#39;t ask what my type was.&quot;

Jesse met her eyes as she asked, &quot;Well, what is your type?&quot;

Amy chuckled softly, &quot;Shy blondes who do my makeup for me.&quot; With that 
she smoothly pulled Jesse into a kiss, the other woman willingly pulling 
her close as the kiss deepened.

They pulled apart finally, leaving Jesse messed up and breathless. &quot;I 
don&#39;t remember you being this aggressive before,&quot; she admitted before 
adding, &quot;I kind of like it.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s the mask,&quot; Amy chuckled wickedly, &quot;wanna help me do a 
expose on the sex lives of super heroes?&quot;

Jesse blushed even brighter, &quot;Yeah....&quot;

End

Notes: Silhouette is a actual character from Watchmen, a member of the 
Minutemen who only appears in flashbacks. I&#39;ve always felt she was a 
interesting character and could have used a modern successor, much like 
Nite Owl and Silk Specter. The reason Silk Specter is not in her 
original costume is due to comments she makes at the end of Watchmen....
