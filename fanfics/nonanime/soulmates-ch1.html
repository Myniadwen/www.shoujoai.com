<h1>Soulmates (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grain.html">Grain</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This story was inspired by the internet fan-film Haloid, 
http://www.gametrailers.com/player/usermovies/57998.html?id=57998 or 
just Google for &quot;Haloid&quot;. I&#39;m not sure if it works or not, the plot 
feels a bit rushed to me. But when I get an Idea I can&#39;t not write it. 
You be the judge if it&#39;s any good. I originally wrote this as a single 
really long chapter but I realize my writings have grown quite long and 
decided to break this up into four chapters. 
 
Note to Halo fans: Please don&#39;t flame me if I got some detail wrong here 
or there. I&#39;ve never played Halo, I have nothing against it I just don&#39;t 
have an X-box. I did research it extensively though before writing this, 
so I&#39;m not completely clueless.   
 
 
Petty Officer Second Class Spartan-458 sat in the main control room of 
the Nassau station stripping down her M6D pistol and then putting it 
back together. It wasn&#39;t dirty, it hadn&#39;t even been fired in months; she 
just had nothing else to do. She was stranded here, in the twenty first 
century, five hundred years in the past, and all alone. To pass the time 
she scanned the analog signals from earth from time to time; some of the 
more interesting fictions amused her, though she scoffed at some of the 
Sci-fi stuff as unrealistic. The program she was watching now was called 
the news, she watched it once in a while for the novelty of seeing 
historic events as they happened. Though what the anchor was talking 
about now had a little more significance to her than most news.  
 
&quot;NASA scientists tell us this will be the largest solar flare in recent 
history. It will occur early tomorrow morning. While not dangerous to 
people, it can cause severe problems with electronics. Expect disruption 
of global communications, including satellites, cell phones, TV and 
radio broadcasts, and internet outages. Power grid failures are also 
likely. Land line phones will most likely be unaffected. If you do have 
an emergency...&quot; 
 
Ignoring the rest of the broadcast, she rolled her chair over to the 
console and tuned the stations sensors on the sun. Sure enough they 
detected the disturbance on the surface, the imminent eruption was 
obvious. Because the station was operating on minimal power it couldn&#39;t 
shield itself from the radiation and didn&#39;t have the benefit of being 
within Earth&#39;s magnetic field. She would make a point to spend the 
duration of the solar flare deep in the bowels of the station to 
minimize her radiation exposure. 
 
------ 
 
She spent the entire day in the engineering room inspecting the systems. 
Due to the lack of available reactor fuel in the 21st century she had 
the reactor running at nominal levels to conserve energy, so half the 
systems were either shut down completely or operating on minimal power 
and as such couldn&#39;t operate reliably. So they required constant 
checking to make sure every thing was running. It was a perfect place to 
hide from the solar flare; it was located in the heart of the station 
and most of the heavy equipment was radiation shielded already. As she 
went over each system one by one an alert went off notifying her of the 
incoming flare. 
 
At first all was normal and she went about her business unconcerned, but 
things quickly went awry. As she stared down one of the long corridors 
she could visibly see its shape twisting and distorting. The solar flare 
was destabilizing the anomaly that had trapped her here in the 21st 
century. The air it self seemed to glow an eerie blue light and objects 
started vanishing and appearing at random. Suddenly the entire 
environment changed, it looked as if the station was under construction, 
and she found herself in a different section of the station all 
together. Then it changed again and it was filled with people going 
about normal operations. As the anomaly faded it went through one final 
change. She was now in the upper habitat area in one of the main 
promenades and there were suddenly hundreds of covenant elites on the 
station, apparently in the midst of an attack. She recovered a BR55 
rifle from a fallen marine and readied herself for battle. 
 
------ 
 
The automated Federation observation outpost drifted casually through 
space. Its sensors bleeped away aimlessly scanning the heavens for 
anything out of the ordinary, when something very out of the ordinary 
happened. Just over two parsecs away, massive space-time fluctuations 
sent distortion waves rippling outward at superluminal velocities. Every 
sensor on the observer perked up and focused on the anomaly. An enormous 
mass was suddenly detected in the center of the event. Then the anomaly 
faded away and only the object remained. The high resolution cameras 
zoomed in on the distant object, took some images and sent them off to 
the Galactic Federation Intelligence Bureau . 
 
------ 
 
&quot;Admiral! Sir, take a look at these.&quot; 
 
&quot;What is this, commander?&quot; 
 
&quot;It appears to be a station of some sort. It just appeared right in the 
middle of Federation space.&quot; 
 
&quot;Could this be a Space Pirate ploy, some kind of weapon?&quot; 
 
&quot;Unknown sir, though it wouldn&#39;t appear so, they lack the technology to 
get something this large that far into our space without being detected 
earlier... Should we redeploy the sixth fleet to intercept?&quot; 
 
&quot;Hmm... negative, they&#39;re patrolling the outer systems for pirate 
activity... we&#39;ll sub-contract a specialist.&quot; 
 
&quot;The usual contact, sir?&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah.&quot; 
 
------ 
 
The small converted freighter approached the derelict station&#39;s 
position. It was adrift and dangerously close to an asteroid field. The 
little ship made a pass over the station looking for a place to dock. 
The station was configured as a large central module with five smaller 
modules around it in a ring, each with a massive glass dome roof. It 
appeared as if the smaller modules served different purposes as the 
interior configuration was different for each one. Yet all had a docking 
port large enough for the ship to land in. It approached one and landed 
inside; the doors automatically closed behind it and the lock was 
pressurized. The ship&#39;s pilot exited through the top hatch and jumped to 
the floor. 
 
Samus Aran stood fully clad in her Chozo powersuit, scanning the new 
area. Her mission; determine the origin of this station and assess any 
possible threat to the Federation, payment received in advance as her 
reputation now allowed her to demand. Detecting no immediate threat she 
proceeded into the station further. As she entered the main section she 
immediately noticed the signs of battle. Bodies of aliens she didn&#39;t 
recognize were scattered about, there was evidence of small arms fire 
and some explosives damage. Then she heard the muffled reverb of shots 
being fired somewhere else in the station; the battle wasn&#39;t over 
apparently. 
 
She took off in the direction of the sounds, and eventually came to a 
room that looked to be a cargo storage area of some kind. She stood on a 
raised walkway that went around the perimeter of the room and formed a 
second level of sorts. As soon as she entered the room a group of a half 
dozen of the unknown aliens attacked her. Wasting no time she fired a 
quick three shot burst of wave/plasma-beam at them, while simultaneously 
leaping over their heads and landing behind. She fired another quick 
three shots, her fully powered and upgraded beam cannon made short work 
of her targets. 
 
Down below on the main deck she saw a bunch more of them swarming about. 
They were exchanging fire with a lone combatant; an armor clad warrior 
returning fire and taking cover behind a metal cargo container. The 
armor wasn&#39;t anything she recognized as something the Federation had 
ever used. Who ever it was he was a very good shot; very efficient and 
precise. The assault rifle he was using didn&#39;t pack near as much punch 
as her integrated cannon, but he was making every shot count; hitting 
vital areas and quickly disabling with the minimum number of shots. 
However the container he used as cover was soon ripped to shreds by 
their weapons exchange and was not good protection anymore. The 
anonymous warrior ran in tangent to them, moving along the perimeter of 
the room, using support beams and other equipment as temporary cover as 
he fired at the aliens who had clustered in the center of the room. 
 
&#39;Damn fine shooting and use of cover. This guy&#39;s a definite pro.&#39; 
 
Deciding she&#39;d watched long enough, Samus jumped down to the lower deck, 
placing herself behind the horde of foes. Most were dead already due in 
large part to the efforts of this mystery man in hefty green armor. She 
walked methodically forward firing slowly and deliberately, though she 
only had to take out a few before they were all gone. Suddenly the 
armored warrior noticed Samus and leveled his gun at her. Samus returned 
his aim but held up her other hand indicating a truce. The soldier moved 
the gun away from his eye but still had it pointed at Samus. Cautiously 
they approached each other. 
 
Spartan-458 eyed her new acquaintance suspiciously. Where had he come 
from all of a sudden? Did the anomaly bring him here? Was this a new 
type of covenant soldier? It didn&#39;t look anything like their technology, 
nor did it look like anything what the U.N.S.C. had, or even of human 
origin. Was this Forerunner technology? She crept ever closer till they 
were about five paces apart. Before she could speak, more elites burst 
into the cargo bay; several dozen streamed in on the lower level. The 
newcomer wasted no time in opening fire on them, using some kind of 
energy beam from the cannon attached to his arm. She began shooting back 
at the elites herself as even more swarmed in. The two of them stood 
back to back, holding off the covenant forces, though it quickly became 
apparent that they were sitting ducks in the center of the room. They 
split up, she took the bottom level as before, and the red and gold clad 
rogue leaped nimbly up to the upper walkway, much to the amazement of 
the Spartan. 
 
&#39;That armor must be pretty light weight to jump around like that. What&#39;s 
it made out of?&#39; she thought. Something about the way it looked and how 
it moved reminded her of a bird. 
 
The avian warrior ran around the perimeter of the room on the upper 
level as she did the same on the lower level. Keeping on opposite sides 
of the room from each other; they worked to corral the elites into the 
center where they were able to pick them off with ease. Suddenly more 
broke in to the room on the upper lever near her new ally. He ran 
towards them shooting, then leaped into the air and kicked off the wall; 
easily evading their shots, he sailed over their heads still, shooting 
the entire time, and landed in the center of the room. He immediately 
jumped again and grabbed onto the railing of the walkway doing a 
handstand; upside down he fired a couple of rockets at them. He then 
pushed off the railing sending himself upward and then kicked off the 
ceiling directly downward and right into the center of the cluster of 
elites. Doing a somersault as he landed his body was shrouded in 
brilliant crackling energy, which killed the elites pretty much on 
contact. The few elites he missed she quickly took out with a few well 
aimed bursts from her BR55 rifle. 
 
&#39;Damn! What impressive agility. How would you even hit something that 
moves like that?&#39; 
 
Samus slowly rose from a crouching position surrounded by the bodies of 
the hostile alien attackers. Though it wasn&#39;t over yet, many more of 
them came from the various different entrances into the cargo bay. Samus 
decided it was time to leave. Apparently her companion came to the same 
conclusion as they both started for the same hallway without need for 
communication. However that hallway quickly filled with the hostile 
aliens as well. Samus tried to hold them off, but there were far too 
many. They had to get down this hall now or they&#39;d be completely 
swarmed. Just as Samus was thinking this she noticed her green armored 
companion actually lifting a small forklift. 
 
&#39;What the hell!&#39; 
 
He then threw the forklift down the hallway sending it barreling over 
their assailants, clearing the path. 
 
&#39;Such raw strength, he could rip me in half.&#39; 
 
Getting over her astonishment, Samus launched a missile at the forklift, 
timing it so it struck just as it reached the end of the hall. It 
exploded spraying dense metal shrapnel everywhere. They ran down the 
hall, but before leaving Samus morphed to ball form, planted a power 
bomb, and then followed her ally out. They climbed over the forklifts 
burning wreckage and alien bodies at the end of the hall and shut the 
hatch behind them. As the hatch closed the power bomb Samus left went of 
off vaporizing everything left still alive in the room. 
 
Once they were through the hatch they were immediately fired upon, but 
the covenant forces here were light compared to earlier and the two of 
them mopped up easily. As the last body fell they approached one 
another, and gave each other a nod, each curious about the other. Rugged 
Mjolnir armor stood facing the sleek Chozo powersuit, their reflections 
gleaming off the others visor. 
 
Samus was about to speak when she was interrupted; the station shook 
violently and they were thrown about. The lights went dim and the loud 
groan of twisting metal could be heard. The massive explosion that shook 
the station was an asteroid that had impacted with it. There would soon 
be more to follow, they had to get out of here now! The roof collapsed 
in a cascade of burning wreckage, blocking the path back to where Samus 
docked. The Spartan headed off in the opposite direction and motioned 
for her to follow. Samus started her ship remotely and instructed it to 
get clear of the asteroids until she was sure where it could pick her 
up. 
 
As they evacuated, more of the ceiling collapsed. Samus morphed into 
ball form and rolled between the debris, however the Spartan was struck 
by a large support beam and buried under a ton of burning wreckage. 
Though she picked herself up almost immediately, her armor was severely 
damaged. She took a step but the joint in her right leg locked up, 
unable to bend, and she limped and stumbled. Samus came up from behind 
her and supported her from the right side and dragged her along as she 
hopped on one foot. 
 
When they reached the end of the corridor they entered one of the five 
domes that encompassed the station. The Spartan stopped them just inside 
the massive doorway. She limped over to a key pad beside the door and 
entered a series of numbers. The large doors slid shut and sealed with a 
hiss. She then entered another code into the pad and a small service 
panel opened revealing a manual release lever. She flipped it, and there 
was a large clunk sound as the dome broke away from the station. A few 
seconds later a set of boosters fired, slowly pushing the dome clear of 
the station. Being on the side of the station facing away from the 
asteroid field it drifted clear of it. Samus now contacted her ship and 
gave it the instructions to rendezvous with the dome and pick her up.
