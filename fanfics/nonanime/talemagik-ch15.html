<h1>Kitty and Illyana: A Tale of Magik! (part 15 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>        &quot;Remarkable,&quot; Professor Charles Xavier blinked.

        &quot;I hope you have something a little more useful than that to 
say,&quot; Kitty&#39;s semi-transparent astral form scolded him gently. &quot;With 
Doctor Strange still gone, you seemed the best person to contact,&quot; the 
brown haired girl explained.

        &quot;Let me get to Cerebro,&quot; the Professor said as he rolled across 
the office, revealing the concealed electronics. He pulled the silvery 
helmet on, then concentrated, his eyes widening as he murmured, 
&quot;Fascinating.&quot;

        &quot;Is that a good fascinating or a bad fascinating?&quot; Kitty asked.

        Professor Xavier gave her a look then said, &quot;Her psionic imprint 
is unique, but it clearly shows traces of both Scott Summers and Jean 
Grey.&quot;

        &quot;Does she have a mutant power?&quot; Kitty asked.

        Xavier focused his concentration, &quot;It seems she inherited 
telekinesis and telepathy at some impressive levels,&quot; he noted, &quot;but her 
individual ability seems to be a separate psionic ability.&quot;

        &quot;So she&#39;s telling us the truth,&quot; Kitty sighed.

        &quot;Apparently so,&quot; he agreed. Xavier looked at her curiously, &quot;I 
would like you to bring her by the mansion, if possible, so that I can 
do a more precise examination.&quot;

        &quot;That may not a good idea,&quot; Kitty shook her head, &quot;her 
resemblance to Jean Grey is uncanny. What if she runs into Scott?&quot;

        &quot;A point,&quot; Professor Xavier acknowledged.

        &quot;Still, I&#39;ll try to bring her by as soon as possible,&quot; Kitty 
said thoughtfully, &quot;we can just put a glamour over her, or something.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; the Professor smiled. He noted that Kitty&#39;s image 
had begun to fade and said, &quot;You&#39;d best cut contact.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Kitty nodded, &quot;talk to you soon....&quot;

        With that, her already semi-clear faded out, entirely 
disappearing in a few moments. Xavier returned the Cerebro helmet to 
it&#39;s place before sighing, &quot;I hope this isn&#39;t more trouble.&quot;

        Kitty blinked a few times, seeing Illyanna looking down at her 
worriedly. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Illyanna asked, blonde hair flowing 
around her.

        &quot;Just a bit of a headache is all,&quot; Kitty said with a sigh, 
uncrossing her legs and getting a bit wobbly to her feet.

        &quot;So what did the Prof. say?&quot; Illyanna asked curiously.

        &quot;As far as he can tell she is the child of Jean and Scott,&quot; 
Kitty answered, stretching out a bit. &quot;Is Rachel still asleep?&quot; she 
asked as they left the study together.

        &quot;She&#39;s still out like a light,&quot; Illyanna noted. She looked over 
at Kitty, &quot;I was a little surprised to see her collapse after eating 
lunch....&quot;

        &quot;Stress, probably,&quot; Kitty shrugged.

        The two went upstairs to the bedrooms, walking down the hallway 
to cautiously open up the door to the guest room that was beside their 
own room. Oddly, Kitty was pretty sure that the room hadn&#39;t been there 
before earlier today. The house had apparently restructured itself to 
create the room, anticipating their needs.

        Rachel slept soundly on the big bed, her short red hair curling 
against her neck. Her green eyes were closed, her slim form curled up a 
bit on the large bed. She rolled over to snore once, loudly, then 
Illyanna reached out to gently pull the door shut.

        They walked a short ways away before Illyanna said, &quot;So what do 
we do now?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure,&quot; Kitty softly admitted. &quot;I kind of doubt 
that we&#39;re qualified to help train her,&quot; she put her hands in her jeans 
pockets as she continued, &quot;not and keep up with are duties as Doctor 
Strange&#39;s apprentices.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll manage, love,&quot; Illyanna said. She gave her lover a smile, 
&quot;Let&#39;s go check the Orb, see if there&#39;s anything new and unusual to deal 
with.&quot;

        &quot;Hopefully not another summoner trying to call up an Elder God,&quot; 
Kitty noted as they walked on, &quot;banishing things back to the Dungeon 
Dimensions isn&#39;t easy.&quot;

        Back in the guest room Rachel waited to be sure they were gone 
before she stretched out, her red hair falling into her face. She sat up 
on the bed, blinking away tiredness, then slid off to walk onto the bare 
floor. She dropped to her knees, closing her eyes as a golden fire 
flickered all around her form. It danced outward, concentrating in front 
of Rachel, and in moments a beautiful woman stood, her body glowing 
red-orange.

        She smiled warmly, scarlet flames dancing around her face like 
hair as she gently said, &quot;Are you well, child?&quot;

        &quot;I am, Lady Phoenix,&quot; Rachel said softly.

        The Phoenix laughed softly, shaking her head. &quot;I&#39;m no lady,&quot; she 
said, &quot;and as I&#39;ve told you before, call me Jean.&quot;

        &quot;Jean then,&quot; Rachel said, a blush to her cheeks. &quot;I&#39;ve safely 
arrived in the past, and my masters remain unaware of your presence,&quot; 
she paused, &quot;I hope.&quot;

        &quot;They won&#39;t remain unaware for long,&quot; Jean noted, &quot;as powerful 
as I am, even I cannot hide from this dimension&#39;s sorcerer supremes.&quot;

        &quot;They aren&#39;t yet... are they?&quot; Rachel blinked in surprise.

        &quot;Dr. Strange has invested them with the task,&quot; Jean said softly, 
&quot;and the great powers of this dimension have sensed the shift.&quot;

        &quot;So I should tell them about you?&quot; Rachel sighed.

        &quot;I think so,&quot; Jean nodded, &quot;and it should be sooner rather than 
later. Keeping secrets from them will make you no friends.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Rachel nodded. She smiled suddenly, &quot;Walk down 
with me?&quot;

        Jean chuckled, &quot;Of course.&quot; They left the bedroom together, 
going towards the stairs as she asked, &quot;Are you truly nervous about 
facing them alone?&quot;

        &quot;Well, Illyanna anyway,&quot; Rachel blushed, &quot;I&#39;ve heard about what 
she did during the Demon Wars, the battle for Limbo.&quot;

        &quot;And Kitty?&quot; Jean asked.

        &quot;No, not Kitty,&quot; Rachel admitted. &quot;She&#39;s always been a bit of an 
adopted Aunt to me, it&#39;s hard to be scared of her,&quot; she explained.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Jean said. They reached the closed door to the 
study, hearing talking going on inside. She turned to Rachel and asked, 
&quot;Ready?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Rachel knocked on the door, waiting until she was invited 
in to push it open. Kitty and Illyanna were bent over one of the orbs, 
studying something intently.

        &quot;Hi,&quot; Kitty looked up with a smile.

        &quot;Uhm,&quot; Rachel took a nervous breath, &quot;I didn&#39;t tell you 
everything, when I first arrived. I&#39;ve me the Phoenix and... well....&quot;

        The Phoenix stepped into view, the fiery incarnation of Jean 
Gray giving both young women a cheery wave as she stood protectively at 
Rachel&#39;s side.

        Kitty blinked in surprise, then pulled out a ten dollar bill and 
passed it to Illyanna with a sigh. &quot;You won the bet, partner,&quot; Kitty 
said.

        &quot;Told you she&#39;d &#39;fess up quickly,&quot; Illyanna smirked as she put 
the money away.

        &quot;You knew?&quot; Rachel blinked.

        &quot;We sensed the Phoenix,&quot; Kitty nodded respectfully to the woman, 
&quot;almost as soon as you arrived. I thought we should give you a chance to 
tell us, first.&quot;

        &quot;And you helped me win a bet,&quot; Illyanna smirked.

        Rachel shook her head, &quot;You two really don&#39;t change too much in 
the next twenty years.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Kitty answered before adding thoughtfully, &quot;I 
think.&quot;</pre>
