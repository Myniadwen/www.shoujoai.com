<h1>The Excalibur Alternative (part 5 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        Rhane Sinclair was standing in the front of the classroom, 
sorting out a pile of papers. Without looking up she asked, &quot;Dani, did 
the protesters leave?&quot;

        Dani Moonstar smiled slightly as the Native American said, &quot;Not 
exactly. It seems that our guests scared them away.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; Rhane looked up with a grin, meeting Pete&#39;s eyes. &quot;Mr. 
Wisdom, it&#39;s good to see you,&quot; she walked quite sedately up to him to 
offer her hand. It was obvious from the bounce in her step that she 
wanted to run, but was restraining herself.

        &quot;You&#39;ve been keeping busy,&quot; Pete looked around at the school 
while he shook the redheaded werewolf&#39;s hand before adding, &quot;And it&#39;s 
Pete, remember?&quot;

        &quot;I try,&quot; Rhane grinned. She looked past him, &quot;Hullo, Rachel.&quot; 
Her eyes widened when she saw Kate, &quot;Kitty? Did something happen to 
you?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s Kate,&quot; she shrugged as she explained, &quot;time travel thing.&quot;

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Rhane nodded, having been in the X-Men long enough to take 
that sort of thing quite calmly. She petted Lockheed, then looked over 
at Lisa, &quot;Have we met?&quot;

        &quot;Not yet,&quot; the slim but muscular blonde smiled, &quot;Lisa Garrison, 
also known as Britannia.&quot;

        &quot;Captain Britain,&quot; Rhane murmured softly. She gave Pete a 
piercing gaze, &quot;You&#39;re reforming Excalibur, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

        &quot;You got it,&quot; Pete nodded, and he included Dani in his look as 
he said, &quot;I was coming here with the intention of asking you to join.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s up to Rhane,&quot; Dani said simply. She smiled, &quot;I&#39;m still a 
reserve X-Man, so I consider myself on-call anyway.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;d be honored to join,&quot; Rhane smiled happily.

        &quot;But,&quot; Rachel waved about the school, &quot;what about this place?&quot;

        Rhane smiled gently, &quot;I founded this place using moneys that 
Moira set up, as part of an educational trust. But now that it&#39;s soon to 
be up and running, I&#39;m going to become more of a liability to the school 
than a benefit.&quot;

        &quot;The protesters outside,&quot; Lisa said sourly.

        &quot;Exactly,&quot; Dani agreed. &quot;We were planning to be out of here soon 
anyway, to take away the lightning rod we represent to them,&quot; she 
explained.

        &quot;Then it&#39;s good to have you,&quot; Pete grinned.

        There was a round of greetings and congratulations as they 
welcomed their new teammates, then Rachel gently put her hand on Pete&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;Would you mind if I take Kate outside for a few minutes?&quot; she 
asked him.

        Pete shrugged slightly, &quot;Sure, just as long as Kate&#39;s going to 
be ready to transport us all back to Muir Island, anyway.&quot;

        Rachel stepped up to Kate, &quot;Would you mind? I want to talk to 
you a minute.&quot;

        &quot;Sure, Rachel,&quot; Kate followed her out with a slight frown on her 
face. It was obvious that the older woman wasn&#39;t quite sure what was 
going on, and it bothered her a little. They moved away from the door to 
the side of the building, where they both stood silently for a bit. 
Finally, Kate just had to ask Rachel, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

        &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot; Rachel asked softly.

        &quot;Tell you what?&quot; Kate blinked.

        &quot;How you feel about me!&quot; she snapped. At Kate&#39;s stunned look 
Rachel took a deep breath, &quot;When I was passing the location information 
from Pete to you, I caught on.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Kate said quietly, &quot;I&#39;ll try to guard my thoughts 
better.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s not what&#39;s bothering me,&quot; Rachel said in much more level 
tones, &quot;why did you never tell me about how you felt?&quot;

        Kate reached up, running a hand through her short brown hair, 
and Rachel marveled at how realistic the illusion surrounding Kate&#39;s 
metal form was. &quot;I started to fall for you not long after we broke out 
of the concentration camp together,&quot; she said to Rachel quietly, &quot;and 
you were still in grieving over Franklin at the time.&quot;

        Rachel nodded reluctantly, &quot;I remember.&quot; She looked over at Kate 
curiously, &quot;But once your mind reformed in Widget, why didn&#39;t you tell 
me then?&quot;

        &quot;My memories were still shot full of holes,&quot; Kate said with a 
wry smile, &quot;something I could feel you trying to fix when we were 
mindlinked.&quot;

        &quot;When we reprogrammed the Sentinels,&quot; Rachel agreed. Linking 
organic with cybernetic minds, Rachel and Widget had invaded the core 
mind of the Sentinels, reprogramming them into a protective force for 
both man and mutant.

        &quot;It wasn&#39;t until you were all gone back to the past that I began 
to fully recall my feelings for you,&quot; Kate said to Rachel softly. 
Another wry smile, &quot;So I built the most humanoid body I could and 
followed you back here.&quot;

        Rachel smiled back, &quot;And when were you planning on telling me?&quot;

        &quot;Once I got my courage up,&quot; Kate shrugged. At Rachel&#39;s odd look 
she elaborated, &quot;You have been one of the most relentlessly heterosexual 
women I know.&quot;

        &quot;A point,&quot; Rachel admitted, &quot;though there have been times...&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Kate looked at her curiously.

        &quot;Kitty and I, once,&quot; Rachel admitted, blushing faintly, &quot;back 
when we were roommates in Excalibur&#39;s old lighthouse base, we flirted 
quite a bit.&quot;

        &quot;So what do you want to do now?&quot; Kate asked Rachel softly.

        &quot;For now, I need to get used to the idea,&quot; Rachel admitted, &quot;not 
just to the idea of a woman being interested in me, but also the fact 
that you&#39;re technorganic, more or less.&quot;

        &quot;I can understand that,&quot; Kate agreed. Quietly she added, &quot;I 
won&#39;t mention any of this to Pete and the others, either.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Rachel smiled. Before Kate could move off she stepped 
forward, gently kissing the older woman on the cheek. &quot;No matter what I 
decide, you&#39;ll always be my friend,&quot; she said simply.

        Pete watched the two women walk in, and frowned slightly. There 
was a slightly different vibe between them, but it didn&#39;t seem to be a 
romantic one. &#39;Damn, I was hoping that Kate told her,&#39; he thought to 
himself grimly.

        &quot;So where do we go now?&quot; Rhane came out from the back of the 
school. Both she and Dani carried a duffel bag each, likely stuffed with 
clothes.

        &quot;Muir Isle,&quot; Pete said. He smiled, &quot;The Prof. said we could use 
it as a base, and from what I understand Lady Moira might have liked 
that.&quot;

        &quot;She would have,&quot; Rhane agreed with a sad smile.

        &quot;Then let&#39;s do this,&quot; Kate shed the illusion, reverting to her 
metallic form. Waves of light emanated from her middle, and in seconds a 
portal shone in front of them.

        &quot;Are you sure this is safe?&quot; Dani looked at it warily.

        &quot;Ridden it three times, haven&#39;t lost anything yet,&quot; Pete 
offered.

        &quot;It&#39;s the &#39;yet&#39; that worries me,&quot; Lisa said as she stepped 
through the portal. The rest soon followed, Rachel, Dani, Rhane, 
Lockheed, Pete and finally Kate herself.</pre>
