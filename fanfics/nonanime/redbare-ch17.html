A girl. A beautiful girl. My girl. Strong and weak. Her soft arms. She 
held me close and turned around. Said she had to. I nodded. She put me 
down. Her eyes were burning. I felt it fill her from top to toe. Her 
limbs were shaking.

She spread her legs. Solid stance. Held up her hand. Palm facing the 
dying man and the moth. A shout from behind. A silent shout. And silent 
and deadly and violent and strong and fast and hard and full and nerve 
killing and bone breaking and awful and lovely and everything and 
anything and something and nothing and all the things on her mind shout 
that tore air and dust and mist and microbes and everything apart as it 
danced spirally through her boiling body toward the enemy that was 
threatening her dad and had to die an awful death and pulled itself 
together to form a spear that pierced the bright shell and cut through 
the interior and finally crushed the moth&#39;s heart sending the beast into 
its doom.

Only in death would the monster be silent. I could see him. He had been 
watching. Doing nothing. I glared. He smiled. The girl&#39;s dad was safe. 
The girl picked me up. I couldn&#39;t walk. She was so strong. My hero. Not 
like him. My lovely hero.

The light returned. Quiet howling far away. The old dumb world returned. 
Fake snow and mist. Better than the sad darkness and rust. The town. It 
didn&#39;t care about us. Better this way.

We had done the stupid school. And those other places. I wondered what 
he had done to the girl&#39;s drawing. I didn&#39;t want to go back to the 
hospital. The man with the gun. He could still be there. Somewhere else.

He had mentioned the lighthouse. No reason to trust him anymore. I 
wanted to hurt him. Make him pay. It was so unfair to the girl&#39;s dad. 
And to the girl. I wondered why he had turned against us.

In the cabin. He was so nice. Gave me everything. But later he looked to 
old. Or sick. I wondered. I had a feeling. We&#39;d find out. In time. 
Patience.

She carried me toward the lake. It was settled. The lighthouse. Right 
and left. No bird monsters or dogs. Couldn&#39;t see us. I had never really 
felt safe before. But now.

I had dozed off. Or maybe she was just that fast. The lake wasn&#39;t far 
away. We stopped outside a house. An adult place. I didn&#39;t like it. She 
didn&#39;t care. Carried me inside.

Bottles. Tables for games with small balls. Green. We continued. The 
bathroom. Filthy. But it was okay. She let go of me. I could stand on my 
own.

The girl turned on the water. Wetted her hands. I pulled up my dress so 
she could wash me. No blood. My skin was blue and purple. But it got off 
when she washed it. The pain left me alone.

Everywhere. She cleaned it all. Washed my sorrows away. To feel better. 
I wasn&#39;t sore anymore. As good as new. I looked at the broken mirror. 
Trace of sadness. Reminded me. I wanted to see myself. There were no 
mirrors anywhere.

The girl said I was pretty. Wasn&#39;t enough. I asked her. She didn&#39;t say 
anything. But I could sense it. She wanted to see herself too. Wondered. 
Someone had broken all the mirrors. So unfair.

I straightened the dress. And the red bow. The light went out. Weak 
howling somewhere. I hated this place. Took her hand. Something 
scratched the toilet stall door. From the inside. I didn&#39;t want to know. 
What it was. Probably something nasty. We left the bathroom.
