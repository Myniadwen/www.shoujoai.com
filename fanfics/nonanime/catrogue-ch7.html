<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Raven Darkholme calmly watched Ororo Monroe walk into her bedroom, 
carrying something black in her hands. &quot;Yes,&quot; she answered Ororo with 
a little smile on her face, having expected to hear a question from 
her for at least a week.

Ororo put the black uniform down, chuckling softly. &quot;You might wait 
until I&#39;ve actually asked you the question,&quot; she pointed out with a 
smile. &quot;I could be here,&quot; she said, her eyes meeting hers, &quot;to ask you 
to marry me or something,&quot;

She smiled up at Ororo as Raven teasingly said, &quot;I don&#39;t think I would 
be terribly bothered by that possibility.&quot;

Ororo blushed a bit, she was still not quite used to her teasing ways. 
&quot;Would you like to join the X-men?&quot; she asked Raven formally.

Raven got up, gently taking the costume into her hands. &quot;I&#39;d be 
honored,&quot; she answered her with a smile, adding, &quot;Now I have a 
question for you.&quot;

&quot;And that would be?&quot; Ororo asked, as Raven paused.

&quot;Would you like to go out with me this evening?&quot; Raven asked her 
softly.



Davis Cameron grinned up at her as his sister paced the large 
apartment they shared the rent on. &quot;And you asked her out right then 
and there?&quot; the sandy hared young man asked her with a delighted smile 
on his face.

The tall blonde pushed her hair back, stopping to frown as she looked 
in the mirror. Heather Cameron sighed, letting it fall back down her 
back again, &quot;Yeah, she was just so... cute.&quot; She sighed again, adding 
ruefully, &quot;Too bad she invited her friends along.&quot;

&quot;So her friends, they&#39;re all mutants, too? That&#39;s kind of cool,&quot; Davis 
said with a smile. &#39;It&#39;ll be nice if she can makes some friends she 
can be more open with,&#39; he thought.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she smiled slightly, &quot;their branch of the X-men is planning to 
stay in Australia.&quot; She paused, &quot;I&#39;m not quite sure how I feel about 
that.&quot;

He raised his eyebrow, flopping down into a nearby chair. &quot;So what&#39;s 
the problem with that?&quot; he asked her curiously.

&quot;Considering all the fights superheroes get into,&quot; she said to him 
dryly, &quot;having them hanging around here might be a bit of a mixed 
blessing.&quot; She sighed, &quot;I could end up being even more busy as 
Lifeguard, not less.&quot;

&quot;Or they may just be a big help,&quot; Davis pointed out. &quot;You know, things 
might turn out better than you think,&quot; and he grinned, &quot;Besides, you 
already told me one was cute.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, she is,&quot; Heather sighed, a dreamy smile on her face. She got an 
odd look on her face, &quot;Don&#39;t change the subject!&quot;

He laughed, getting up to leave the room. &quot;You better start getting 
ready to go,&quot; he advised her with a smile. &quot;I won&#39;t wait up for you,&quot; 
he added over his shoulder.

Heather sighed, rummaging through her closet. &quot;I won&#39;t wait up for 
you,&quot; she echoed him mockingly, &quot;like that&#39;s likely.&quot;



Kitty sat cross-legged on the bed, watching Sage with a great deal of 
amusement. &quot;So we&#39;re coming along as, what? Your chaperones?&quot; she 
asked her with a impish little smile.

&quot;Don&#39;t tease me about this, please,&quot; Sage quietly said. &quot;I still have 
no idea what possessed me to say yes in the first place,&quot; she sighed.

&quot;The fact that she&#39;s so beautiful probably didn&#39;t hurt,&quot; Rogue pointed 
out. She looked over at Sage curiously, &quot;Have you ever been out with a 
woman before?&quot;

&quot;Occasionally,&quot; Sage admitted, absentmindedly sorting out the clothes 
she had planned to wear tonight, &quot;Emma Frost, the White Queen, liked 
to play for the other team sometimes.&quot;

Kitty was instantly struck by a remarkably clear image of the white 
leather clad Emma with Sage, and with a soft groan she put her head in 
her hands. &quot;I now have a mental image of you I never, ever wanted,&quot; 
Kitty sighed.

&quot;You asked her,&quot; Rogue said reasonably. She looked over at Sage, &quot;Is 
Heather coming to get you here, or are we meeting her somewhere?&quot;

&quot;I retained enough sense to ask her to meet us downtown,&quot; Sage said 
dryly. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this,&quot; she said, shaking her 
head.

Kitty looked up and noticed that there was someone lurking by the 
doorway. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Kitty said to Rogue and Sage, getting up and 
walking out into the hallway. Ororo lurked there, looking distinctly 
nervous.

&quot;How&#39;s Sage doing?&quot; Ororo asked Kitty somewhat distractedly.

&quot;We&#39;re managing to prevent any actual panic,&quot; Kitty said with a smile. 
She looked at Ororo worriedly, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Raven asked me out,&quot; Ororo said with a little smile.

Kitty grinned as she declared, &quot;It&#39;s about time!&quot; She stuck her head 
back in the room to tell them loudly, &quot;Sage, Raven finally asked Ororo 
out!&quot; Ororo made frantic shushing motions with her hands, blushing 
brightly.

&quot;Who won the betting pool?&quot; Rogue asked Sage curiously.

&quot;Bishop,&quot; Sage sighed, &quot;he bet on this week.&quot;

&quot;You were betting on this?&quot; Ororo said, an odd look on her face.

&quot;Too bad you didn&#39;t hold off for another week,&quot; Kitty sighed 
dramatically, &quot;I put a bet down in your name for then.&quot;

&quot;I could always ask Raven to put it off for a week,&quot; Ororo said dryly. 
She shook her head, &quot;I just wanted to warn you we may be running into 
each other, downtown.&quot;

Rogue chuckled, &quot;Looks like things will be getting a bit crowded.&quot;

Kitty looked curious, &quot;What are you wearing?&quot;

Ororo obviously hadn&#39;t thought much about that. &quot;I suppose my regular 
things?&quot; she said, making it a question.

Kitty sighed loudly. &quot;On your first date?&quot; she asked her 
disbelievingly. Kitty shook her head, calling back into the room, 
&quot;Rogue, you stay to help Sage, I&#39;ll go take care of Ororo.&quot; The two 
could hear them both still talking as they went down the hallway, and 
by the sound of it Kitty was getting increasingly exasperated with 
Ororo&#39;s answers.

Sage smiled, shaking her head. &quot;They really do seem like a mother and 
daughter,&quot; she commented thoughtfully. She looked over at Rogue, &quot;How 
are things with you and Raven?&quot;

Rogue looked a bit surprised at Sage&#39;s interest. &quot;Not bad,&quot; she said 
cautiously, &quot;we&#39;ve always tried to maintain good relations despite 
whatever might be going on. But now that she&#39;s my teammate, it&#39;s a bit 
odd.&quot;

&quot;Do you think she&#39;s seriously interested in Ororo?&quot; Sage asked, 
sounding honestly concerned about her.

&#39;Of course, Storm&#39;s the one she&#39;s closest to. Does she think Raven&#39;s a 
rival?&#39; Rogue found herself wondering. &quot;I think she&#39;s serious,&quot; Rogue 
answered honestly. Trying to change the subject, she asked her &quot;Have 
you decided what to wear?&quot;

A faint blush appeared on Sage&#39;s cheeks. She seemed to become younger, 
somehow, as she held up a black dress against her front, &quot;Do you think 
this looks good?&quot;

Kitty passed Elizabeth and Neal in the hallway, both of them dressed 
to the nines. &quot;We&#39;re going out while we have the chance,&quot; Neal 
explained with a smile.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Elizabeth quickly reassured Kitty, &quot;I won&#39;t over do 
things.&quot;

Kitty chuckled, &quot;Elizabeth, go have some fun. We&#39;ll skip a day, you&#39;re 
progressing nicely and you could use a break.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, sensei,&quot; Elizabeth said with a respectful nod.

&quot;I&#39;ll never get used to that,&quot; a blushing Kitty muttered to Ororo 
softly, who just laughed at her softly in reply.



Heather looked at her watch nervously. Her long golden hair flowed 
over her shoulders, highlighting her blue eyes. A white blouse was 
tucked into a pair of blue dress pants, giving her a casual but sexy 
look.

The jeep came around the corner, rumbling to a stop not far from her. 
Rogue jumped down to help Kitty out, they both were dressed in... 
something or other, but Heather found that she only had eyes for Sage.

The black hair had been let down, reaching the pale white shoulders. A 
black, slinky dress hugged the slim but shapely form, and she moved 
with a smooth elegance. The eyes were still hidden behind the red 
shades, but a slight smile teased her lips.

Sage&#39;s eyes widened as she took in the busty, athletic form of Heather 
Cameron, not much obscured by her choice of clothing. She tried to 
swallow, finding her throat strangely tight, and smiled up at the 
taller woman.

&quot;Thank you, for inviting me out,&quot; Sage said softly.

Heather smiled down at her, &quot;The pleasure&#39;s all mine.&quot; She gentlemanly 
offered Sage her arm, and with a shy smile Sage took it. They walked 
into the classy restaurant together, seemingly lost in each other&#39;s 
eyes.

&quot;They completely forgot about us,&quot; Kitty said, not sounding offended, 
but instead rather amused by it all.

Rouge laughed, &quot;I guess that means our services aren&#39;t needed, then.&quot; 
She gave Kitty a smile, &quot;Want to go out dancing, instead?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Kitty said, climbing back into the jeep.

A sports car cruised by them, Raven driving with a cool competence, 
Ororo leaning back in the passenger seat with a smile. The two gave 
them a cheery wave, and found themselves completely ignored, yet 
again.

&quot;Is that Kitty and Rogue back there?&quot; Raven asked with a sly smile.

&quot;Looks like it,&quot; Ororo sighed. &quot;Maybe if we ignore them, they&#39;ll just 
go away?&quot; she suggested to her with a smile.

Raven shifted gears, and blushed softly as Ororo gently lay her hand 
on top of hers. She looked over, and tried not to look down the 
leather top she was wearing. With the skintight leather pants and her 
long white hair, Ororo was almost heart-stopping.

Ororo let her hand linger on Raven&#39;s, stroking the soft skin gently. 
She stretched, and had to fight back a smile as Raven visibly gulped. 
The other woman was almost classically butch, a black dress jacket and 
matching pants with a white shirt underneath completing the look.

&quot;So where are we going?&quot; Ororo asked her curiously.

&quot;A little place I discovered the last time I was here,&quot; Raven said 
softly. They pulled into what looked almost like a residential area, 
up a driveway to a cleverly hidden parking lot.

The building looked like a mansion, but it was obviously converted to 
a commercial venture. They walked up to the main doors, passing the 
only sign the place had: a simply designed &quot;The Rose.&quot; Raven opened 
the door, gesturing Ororo to go first, then she followed her in.

&quot;Welcome to the Rose,&quot; a pretty blond hared young woman said with a 
smile.

&quot;Party of two, under Darkholme,&quot; Raven said with a smile.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, we have your reservation,&quot; she said pleasantly. She 
picked up two menus and led them to a corner table, poured them each a 
glass of water and left them in peace.

&quot;Quite the place,&quot; Ororo said, looking around her curiously. The 
tables were all very private, fabric draping concealing each diner 
from the others. The ceiling was vaulted, and there was a painting on 
the roof. Ororo squinted to see it better, and suddenly blushed.

Raven looked up too, then she chuckled softly. &quot;Sorry, I should have 
warned you,&quot; she said, gesturing to the erotic paintings. &quot;This is a 
former bordello, founded not long after the island officially stopped 
being a penal colony,&quot; she explained with a smile. &quot;The building was 
abandoned for quite a few years,&quot; she smiled, &quot;and now it&#39;s a lesbian 
run restaurant.&quot;

&quot;Why do I get the feeling there&#39;s more to the story,&quot; Ororo said with 
a chuckle.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Raven asked her quite innocently.

&quot;How did you find out about this place?&quot; Ororo asked curiously.

A quiet laugh from nearby, &quot;She helped found it.&quot; Ororo turned in her 
seat to see a smiling older woman, a bit of gray in her hair, but 
still quite beautiful. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you, Raven,&quot; the lady said 
with a smile.

&quot;Jenn, meet Ororo. Ororo, meet Jenn,&quot; Raven performed the 
introductions.

Jenn smiled at Ororo. &quot;Raven saved me and my lover from gaybashers a 
few years ago,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;We fed her, in thanks, and she 
suggested we start up a restaurant. After we said we didn&#39;t have the 
money, she provided it!&quot; she said with an eloquent shrug.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t so much,&quot; Raven said with a blush.

Jenn laughed, &quot;You eat free, tonight.&quot; Raven tried to protest, but 
Jenn just ignored her. She looked thoughtfully between Raven and 
Ororo, and with a smile added, &quot;And if you want an upstairs room, 
that&#39;s free too.&quot;

Raven, if possible, blushed harder. &quot;Upstairs room?&quot; Ororo asked her 
softly.

&quot;If a couple is getting along particularly well,&quot; Raven explained 
sheepishly, &quot;they can rent a room for the night.&quot;

&quot;You never cease to surprise me,&quot; Ororo admitted with a blush.

Raven took a breath, &quot;I hope this doesn&#39;t surprise you.&quot; With that, 
she leaned across the table to gently kiss Ororo. She drew back, to 
see her reaction.

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Ororo said huskily, and drew her into a kiss herself. A 
longer, more thorough kiss than before, one that left them breathless.

&quot;You don&#39;t really want dinner, do you?&quot; Raven asked, an entreaty 
clearly apparent in her shaky voice.

&quot;I suppose not,&quot; Ororo blushed, taking her hand.

A smiling Raven drew her along until they reached a set of concealed 
stairs. She took a set of keys from a hook, and gently pulled her 
upstairs.
