<h1>The Adventures of Shadowcat and Rogue! (part 3 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Kitty felt her heart drop in her chest as Gambit casually walked right 
into the room their first meeting was held only two weeks ago. The 
brown hared Cajun was as rakishly handsome as ever, and Kitty just 
knew the exact reason why he was here. He looked around the room 
curiously until Ororo spotted him.

&quot;Remy!&quot; Ororo said happily. They had shared quite a few adventures 
together, so Kitty could certainly understand her cheerful greeting. 
&quot;When did you get here?&quot;

&quot;Been here awhile, Stormy,&quot; he said, using his nickname for her. Ororo 
mock glared at him, but he just grinned back at her impishly. &quot;So 
where&#39;s Rogue at? I want to see if she still remembers me,&quot; he said 
with a small smile.

&quot;Remy, you should know..&quot; Ororo started to say to him, but Gambit was 
gone before she could finish the sentence. She turned to where Kitty 
was standing nearby. &quot;Kitty, you better tell Rogue he&#39;s coming,&quot; she 
urged her.

&quot;Right,&quot; Kitty nodded, then air walked her way up to the roof and 
through it into hers and Rogue&#39;s bedroom. Rogue was getting changed, 
and Kitty really wanted to stay there and savor the sight. &quot;Gambit&#39;s 
here,&quot; Kitty said without preamble.

Rogue stopped cold, then she finished dressing herself rather quickly. 
&quot;We knew it would happen,&quot; she said calmly, &quot;might as well get it over 
with.&quot; She looked over at Kitty, and suddenly seemed much less self 
confident, &quot;Would you mind coming with me?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Kitty gently assured her. They headed downstairs to see 
Gambit holding court in the living room, spinning another one of his 
tall tales.

&quot;Cherie!&quot; he exclaimed, and quickly was right in front of them. He put 
his hands on the surprised Rogue&#39;s shoulders and leaned in to try and 
steal a kiss.

&quot;Back off, Remy,&quot; a clearly angry Rogue growled, pushing him back from 
her firmly. He looked honestly surprised as he staggered backward a 
step, barely keeping his balance as he gazed at Rogue in shock.

Kitty reached over and took Rogue&#39;s hand as she said to him firmly, 
&quot;Rogue&#39;s involved with someone else now.&quot;

He stood there, looking like someone had hit him in the back of the 
head. &quot;What?&quot; he asked them quietly. Not waiting for an answer, he 
quickly turned and fled.

&quot;That went well,&quot; Sage said with a small sigh. She looked over at 
Kitty and Rogue, &quot;It seems we may have another small problem.&quot;

&quot;What now?&quot; Rogue asked her irritably. She really wanted a villain to 
appear as she had a great desire to hit something till it bled.

&quot;It seems your mother&#39;s coming to Australia,&quot; a slightly smiling Sage 
said to them, staying totally deadpan.

Rogue looked kind of happy at that small piece of news, while poor 
Kitty went near totally white. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Rogue asked her 
worriedly.

&quot;A case of meet the parents anxiety,&quot; Kitty admitted with a small 
laugh. She got her color back quickly enough, though she still looked 
awfully nervous.

&quot;Do we know when she&#39;ll arrive?&quot; Rogue asked.

&quot;Thanks to Kitty&#39;s hacking expertise, I can tell you that she&#39;s 
arriving tomorrow in Sydney,&quot; Sage said calmly.

&quot;I guess I better go meet her,&quot; Rogue said to herself softly. Kitty 
walked over to put her hand gently on Rogue&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;d like to come along too,&quot; Kitty said, smiling shyly.



&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Ororo asked him softly as she came up behind the 
thief.

Gambit turned to her, and Ororo was surprised to see the faint shine 
of unshed tears in his eyes. &quot;I guess I really screwed things up this 
time, huh?&quot; he said to her quietly. He turned back to gaze out at the 
calm ocean.

&quot;I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t all your doing, Remy,&quot; she chided him gently. 
Ororo smiled a bit when she added softly &quot;I&#39;ve watched them together 
for these last two weeks, and they are honestly happy with each 
other.&quot;

He nodded a bit, then reached up to light a smoke. He inhaled, then 
blew a stream of smoke into the dark night. &quot;Not something I was very 
good at, making her happy,&quot; he quietly admitted. He looked sadly at 
Ororo, &quot;Stormy, I won&#39;t be sticking around.&quot;

&quot;We could use your help,&quot; Ororo said to him softly, more out of some 
loyalty to a old friend than out of any great need. She had sent him 
an invitation before she knew for sure that Kitty was joining. &#39;And 
before I knew about Kitty and Rogue,&#39; she thought ruefully.

He shook his head. &quot;My power&#39;s not that spectacular,&quot; he said, &quot;and 
I&#39;ve seen Pryde in operation.&quot; He smiled a bit, adding &quot;She can get 
into some places even I never could.&quot; He put the smoke out, looking 
very serious all of a sudden. &quot;I&#39;ll be going, once I take care of one 
thing,&quot; he said. With that, he seemed to disappear into the shadows.

Kitty stopped drying the dish she was holding, carefully placing it in 
the drying rack. She didn&#39;t seem too surprised, when Gambit stepped 
from the darkness outside into the warmth of the cozy kitchen. She had 
already known he was out there. &quot;Gambit,&quot; she said to him with a 
respectful but cautious nod, &quot;how can I help you?&quot;

&quot;Take care of her, please,&quot; a sadly smiling Gambit said to Kitty 
quietly. She turned to him in surprise as he continued, &quot;Storm says 
you make her happy, Kitty-cat, and for that I&#39;m glad. She&#39;s not as 
tough as she seems...&quot;

Kitty was glad he was conceding peacefully, she didn&#39;t want to have to 
hurt him. She smiled gently at the obviously uncomfortable man, &quot;I&#39;ll 
watch Rogue&#39;s back, Remy.&quot; She gave him a steady smile, &quot;I promise you 
that.&quot;

Gambit smiled a bit sadly, nodded, and with that, he was gone, out the 
window and off into the darkness of night.



Raven Darkholme walked out of the arrival gate and stopped cold, only 
to duck behind a nearby pillar before the two of them could spot her. 
Rogue and Kitty stood together, obviously waiting for something, or 
someone. &#39;How did they know I was coming? And where are the rest of 
the X-Men hiding?&#39; Raven thought to herself worriedly.

After a few minutes of frantically scanning the nearby crowds, a 
revelation slowly dawned on her: there were no other X-Men here. 
Raven&#39;s cheeks colored a bit, it seemed Rogue was just here to greet 
her, just like any other normal person. Why Kitty was there too was a 
bit of a mystery, but...

She grinned, and transformed.

Kitty watched the crowds nervously, even as Rogue watched her with a 
bit of amusement. &quot;Calm down, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be here soon,&quot; Rogue 
reassured her.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Kitty said. She took a few deep calming breaths as she tried 
to using some of the relaxation techniques Prof. Xavier had taught 
them. &quot;It&#39;s just that this is the first time I&#39;m meeting your mom 
since we&#39;re become lovers. I&#39;ve met her before, but now it feels 
different, you know?&quot; she said with a small smile.

Rogue chuckled softly, &quot;Now you know how I felt when Storm met us 
here.&quot; She grinned over at Kitty.

Kitty laughed a bit, &quot;A very good point.&quot; She suddenly goggled, 
looking at a pretty young woman move towards them through the crowded 
airport. The little blond was outrageously stacked, almost impossibly 
so in fact. &quot;I wonder how many operations that took,&quot; she quietly 
commented, discretely pointing out the blonde to Rogue.

Rogue turned to look at the girl, then she broke into a smile. &quot;None, 
probably,&quot; she remarked to Kitty with a impish grin. Before Kitty 
could answer that, Rogue stepped forward to sweep the little blonde 
into a hug, crying out &quot;Raven!&quot;

&quot;Curses, foiled again,&quot; Raven Darkholme&#39;s amused voice said out of the 
blonde&#39;s mouth. &quot;At least I fooled her,&quot; she said with a grin to the 
clearly stunned looking Kitty. The girl stood there a moment longer 
before shaking off her stupor.

Rogue grinned over at Kitty, &quot;It&#39;s an old game we like to play. Raven 
tries to change into something that can fool me, but somehow I always 
know it&#39;s her.&quot; She grinned at the blonde, &quot;It&#39;s great to see you, 
Mom.&quot;

Raven blushed a bit, hugging Rogue back fiercely. &quot;You, too,&quot; she said 
to her simply. She then looked curiously over at Kitty, &quot;I was a 
little bit surprised to see you waiting here with the welcome wagon, 
though.&quot;

Kitty blushed, smiling shyly. &quot;Rogue&#39;s my...&quot; Kitty started, only to 
chicken out, &quot;best friend, so I wanted to be here for her.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll get your bags, Mom, you head for the parking lot. We&#39;ve got a 
black Jeep waiting for you,&quot; Rogue said cheerfully.

Raven walked a few steps, then something made her stop and turn 
around. Rogue and Kitty reached out and took each others hands as they 
walked together to the luggage carousel. &#39;Well, isn&#39;t that 
interesting,&#39; a smiling Raven thought to herself. Finding a suitably 
concealed place. she returned to her usual dark hared look, and then 
went to meet them at the jeep.

Rogue chuckled softly as she took Kitty&#39;s hand comfortingly. &quot;Do you 
want me to be the one to tell her?&quot; Rogue offered.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I froze like that,&quot; Kitty sighed. She looked over at 
Rogue curiously, &quot;Do you think she&#39;ll mind that your a lesbian?&quot;

&quot;She used to give me some trouble for dating Gambit, but I think that 
was just the regular &#39;parent and no-good son-in-law&#39; problems,&quot; Rogue 
ruefully explained to Kitty. She laughed softly as she added, &quot;When we 
had our little birds and the bees talk, Raven and Irene were careful 
to point out to me that the girl birds do end up liking the other girl 
birds, sometimes, and that it was perfectly all right if it happened 
to me.&quot;

Kitty got the mental image of a much younger Rogue getting that kind 
of lecture from the two older ladies, and just had to laugh at it.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Raven asked as the two neared the Jeep she was 
leaning against. Kitty blushed and slipped her hand out of Rogue&#39;s 
grip.

&quot;The birds and the bees talk,&quot; Rogue explained to her cheerfully. She 
looked sideways at Kitty, &quot;I was just telling my lover here about what 
you told me.&quot;

Kitty, if it was possible, blushed even redder. She tried to find 
something, anything, to say, only to finally give up and take Rogue&#39;s 
hand, their matching rings glimmering in the golden light of the 
setting sun.

Raven looked at them steadily a moment, then she stepped forward to 
place a hand on each of their shoulders. &quot;I&#39;m glad for you,&quot; she said, 
smiling at them widely. She startled them both by pulling them into a 
fierce hug!

&quot;Thanks, Mom,&quot; Rogue said to her quietly. They pulled back, and Rogue 
was surprised to see a few tears in Raven&#39;s eyes.

Raven looked over at Kitty. &quot;Now you treat my daughter well,&quot; she 
said, half mock lecture, half seriously. Kitty just nodded to her 
gravely, and Raven grinned. After a few passerby gave them some odd 
looks, a smiling Raven said, &quot;Let&#39;s hit the road before we&#39;re busted 
for public indecency or something.&quot;

Rogue took the wheel, Raven rode shotgun and Kitty took the backseat, 
sticking her head up between the seats to stay in the conversation. 
Kitty smiled at Raven shyly, &quot;I hope you approve of me being with 
Rogue.&quot;

&quot;I wondered about the two of you, when you came to rescue me in 
Germany,&quot; Raven admitted, giving Kitty a shrewd look. &quot;Where you 
involved back then?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d thought about it,&quot; Rogue admitted, something that she hadn&#39;t even 
told Kitty before. The girl in question looked honestly surprised.

&quot;You might have told me something,&quot; Kitty said with a little laugh.

Raven reached back to pat a surprised Kitty on the shoulder. &quot;It 
happens, believe me.&quot; She smiled a bit, &quot;I wasn&#39;t even aware that 
Irene shared my feelings for a long time.&quot; She smiled to herself a 
little sadly, remembering the young, cocky consulting detective she 
had been, silently in love with the aristocratic lady, Irene Alder.

&quot;Mom,&quot; Rogue asked her softly, &quot;have you been... seeing anyone 
lately?&quot;

Raven rolled her eyes violently. She then smiled wryly over at Kitty, 
&quot;Here comes the &#39;You should put your grief aside and embrace love once 
again&#39; speech,&quot; she said with a little groan.

Kitty snickered, getting a glare from Rogue.

&quot;I&#39;m serious, mom,&quot; Rogue protested. &quot;Irene wouldn&#39;t have wanted you 
to grieve for her forever,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;Prison isn&#39;t the best place to meet people, unless it&#39;s the nice girl 
in the next cell over,&quot; Raven pointed out to her reasonably.

&quot;She&#39;s does have a point,&quot; Kitty observed, and Rogue sighed.

&quot;Where exactly are we going, anyway?&quot; Raven asked her daughter 
curiously, trying hard to change the subject.

&quot;Time for the good news and the bad news,&quot; Kitty said with a cheerful 
smile, sounding almost like a perky tour guide. &quot;The good news is that 
the beach safehouse has been aired out, and we&#39;ve prepared a room for 
you right beside our own.&quot;

&quot;And the bad news?&quot; a suddenly suspicious Raven asked her pointedly. 
Kitty faltered a bit, so Rogue took up the explaination.

&quot;The ground floor rooms are filled with the X-Men,&quot; Rogue said to her 
simply, waiting with a impish smile for her mother&#39;s reaction.

Raven quickly looked back and forth between Kitty and Rogue, an really 
odd expression on her dark face. &quot;Do the other X-men know about my 
staying there?&quot; she asked them, sounding more than a little dubious.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kitty answered with a cheery smile, &quot;I think Ororo, at least, 
is really looking forward to seeing you.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll probably try to recruit you to help us search for Destiny&#39;s 
other diaries,&quot; a smiling Rogue said, keeping her eyes on the road 
ahead. &quot;If you&#39;re not interested, just tell her and she&#39;ll leave you 
alone.&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Raven answered her dryly. She blushed a bit, 
remembering an earlier meeting with the X-men&#39;s leader.

A mischievous Raven had arranged for them to meet in a gay bar to 
discuss their business. Destiny had forseen that Rogue was in grave 
trouble, and Raven had given Storm the information on how she could 
save her. But it was something else that made the wild night so 
memorable. Shifting and changing her form, Raven had taunted, teased 
and flirted with the austure X-man, and strangely Storm had flirted 
right back! If she hadn&#39;t been with Irene then, Raven really wondered 
what she might have done.

They pulled up to the mansion, the sound alerting someone who awaited 
within. Storm walked outside and down the steps to the jeep, smiling a 
bit at Raven. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time,&quot; the leader of the X-men said 
with a smile.

Raven gazed at her a moment, a little bit speechless. &quot;It&#39;s good to 
see you,&quot; she barely managed to get out.

Kitty and Rogue exchanged thoughtful looks behind her.
