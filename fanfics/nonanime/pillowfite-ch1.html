<h1>Pillow Fights</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dawnc.html">Dawn C.</a><br> </h2>
<pre>    Jessica sat on the floor leaning over her friend April&#146;s hands. A 
few minutes before pillows had flown in a two-person pillow fight, now 
she was very involved in painting an even, smooth surface onto April&#146;s 
nails. She spread her own fingers and held the paintbrush daintily 
between thumb and forefinger as her own crimson nails dried. When she 
was done, April laughed her infectious giggle and waved her hands, 
blowing on them gently.
    &#147;Damn you&#146;re good&#148; she gushed, studying her hands for drips. &#147;This 
is as good as a professional, maybe.&#148;
    &#147;Not that I have anything against Cosmetics, but I think I want to 
do something other than manicure.&#148;    
     April looked surprised for a second. Then she nodded her head 
amusedly. Jessica had really changed since the Vince incident. Before 
she would have spitefully driven her comment at the working class. As 
she stared at her friend&#146;s face; contented in the lamplight, she 
reworded her statement. She had not changed so much as regressed, back 
to the girl who had been brave enough to save her from bullies in 4th 
grade, before society and wealth had spoiled her into someone April 
was sometimes sad to know.
    Jessica narrowed her eyes. &#147;Why are you looking at me like that?&#148; 
She growled playfully.
    April blushed, and then asked the question that had been tickling 
her mind for a month. &#147;What was it like? Being a man?&#148;
    Jessica groaned, &#147;That again, don&#146;t remind me, I know I&#146;ve told 
you before. It was hairy, stinky, and extremely gross.&#148;
    &#147;Yes, you were.&#148; April agreed cheekily and busted into laughter. 
It abruptly stopped when she saw Jessica standing above her fingers 
outstretch and ready for a torturous tickle session. April cringed 
into her pillow nest. &#147;Don&#146;t hurt me!&#148; she squealed.
    Jessica smirked and sat back down. &#147;Sissy.  But really I&#146;ve told 
you and the girls everything.&#148;
    &#147;Everything?&#148; April drawled.
    &#147;Yes, everything.&#148; Jessica frowned.
    &#147;But did you try out the equipment?&#148;
    Jessica&#146;s eyes bugged.
    &#147;You know, did you &#145;masturbate&#146;?&#148; she whispered the last word 
lewdly.
    &#147;Huh? You know that I hate you.&#148; She covered her red face with her 
hands. &#147;Yes I did, once.&#148;
    April scooted closer. &#147;What was it like?&#148;
    &#147;You have the mind of a 14 year old boy in puberty.&#148;
    &#147;I know. What was it like?&#148;
    &#147;I guess it was hot &amp; sticky. It was over quickly. It&#146;s a lot 
easier to get off as a male. Actually,&#148; she grinned ruefully. &#147;I can 
understand why guys try so hard to get past first base; their bodies 
are walking hormone factories.
    Jessica looked down at her friend. She was staring at her again, a 
soft look in her eye that had been appearing on and off ever since she 
had turned into &#145;Vince&#146; for a week.
    &#147;She needs to get a girl friend.&#148; She mused aloud.
    &#147;What?&#148;
    Jessica said it again a more confidently. &#147;You need to get a girl 
friend&#148;
    This time April&#146;s eyes bugged out as she tried to gasp in protest. 
&#147;But I&#146;m not&#133;I don&#146;t.&#148;
    &#147;You&#148;
    &#147;No.&#148;
    &#147;need&#148;
    &#147;I&#146;m not&#133;&#148;
    &#147;a&#148;
    &#147;I can&#146;t&#133;&#148;
    &#147;girlfriend&#148;
    &#147;Your wrong&#133;&#148; 
    At every word, Jessica had moved closer and closer to April, 
crawling in a predatory path across the pillow-strewn floor, invoking 
in April an instinctual need to protect herself as she held the pillow 
in front of her face. Jessica patiently pulled it own of her grasp and 
set it behind them. She used one hand to lift Aprils chin so that they 
faced each other, and then she kissed her.
    At first, her best friend sat un-responding, shivering and frozen. 
However, Jessica did not give up and soon April&#146;s mouth began to move 
against hers. Suddenly as if a switch in April and been thrown on she 
was pressing hungrily into Jessica and her tongue flicked dangerously 
against Jessica&#146;s teeth. Jessica stopped and slowly disengaged herself 
from April&#146;s mouth. April leaned in and hugged her best friend, hoping 
unreasonably that she would never have to let go. &#147;I love you,&#148; she 
whispered brokenly.
    &#147;I know&#148; Jessica soothed, running her hands over Aprils hair as 
the smaller girl burrowed deeper onto her lap. &#147;I love you to.&#148;
    April pushed away to look into her eyes
    Jessica&#146;s heart broke a little to see the hopeful look in her 
friend&#146;s eyes. &#147;Yes, but... Not like that.&#148; She cringed inside at 
April&#146;s wounded look. &#147;April, look at me. I think you are the most 
amazing friend in the whole world. If I did not love Jake with all my 
heart and know without a doubt that I am entirely straight, I would be 
begging you right now to be my girlfriend. 
    April looked abashed, &#147;So that kiss did nothing for you?&#148;
    Jessica shook her head. &#147;I&#146;m not saying it was not very, very nice 
but it was missing something. A spark for me, fire.&#148;
     &#147;Oh&#148;
    &#147;Not for you though, huh?
    April nodded her head &#145;yes&#146; and looked glumly at the floor.
    &#147;So will you stop fighting me and yourself and admit to this 
before I have to resort to more drastic more drastic measures&#148;
    &#147;I wouldn&#146;t mind&#148; April leered.
    &#147;I know you wouldn&#146;t, so say it, &#145;You need a girlfriend&#146;&#148;
    &#147;I need a&#133;a&#133;girlfriend.&#148; She finished at last and smiled widely 
this time. &#147;What&#146;s more I want a girlfriend because I am gay and I 
always will be gay and I know that I am gay because I&#146;ve liked you 
forever, since before you turned into a male. Wow! I feel empowered 
now.&#148;
    Her voice had been becoming a progressively louder and louder 
until she was practically yelling so Jessica stopped her from outing 
herself to the whole neighborhood by putting her hand over Aprils 
mouth and that disintegrated into the much awaited tickle fest.
    The shrieking and thumping alerted April&#146;s mom below and she was 
about sneak up the stairs, her paranoid brain moving overtime. April&#146;s 
Father stopped and pulled her by her elbow to the living room where he 
forced her to play chess. He held an involuntary psychologist 
appointment over her head.
    Upstairs Jessica lay exhausted with April using her stomach as a 
pillow. &#147;I will help you get over me,&#148; She said with fierce resolve.
    &#147;So you get to play matchmaker, you mean&#148;
    &#147;Of course!&#148; They burst out laughing for no apparent reason at all 
until cramps in their stomach forced them to stop.
