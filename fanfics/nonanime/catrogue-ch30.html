<h1>The Adventures of Shadowcat and Rogue! (part 30 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch29.html">Back to Part 29</a><pre>        Across the sand and dirt he ran as fast as he could, the blue 
furred figure almost bouncing as he put as much space between himself 
and the small outback town. &#39;Stryfe should have listened to me,&#39; McCoy 
thought grimly, &#39;taken down the X-men as fast as possible.&#39;

        Instead, the armored figure was up there playing games, Stryfe 
enjoying using his enhanced telekinesis to toy with the X-men. The graft 
of Nate Gray&#39;s DNA onto him had only barely been completed, and it 
hadn&#39;t had any chance to stabilize yet. He should have been resting, 
letting the changes set in and discovering the full depths of his power.

        &#39;But the X-men didn&#39;t give us that time,&#39; McCoy thought. The 
blue furred man bounced over a rise, feeling just a bit of regret that 
Feral was staying behind. &#39;She made her choice,&#39; he mused, &#39;she&#39;ll just 
have to live or die by it.&#39;

        Skidding McCoy slid down a rise, coming to rest there as he 
waited to see if there were any pursuit. He frowned, looking around, 
wondering what was bothering him. His eyes widened as he say the 
particles of dust hovering in the air, the gleam of metal.

        &quot;Oh no,&quot; McCoy muttered softly.

        THUMP!

        Everything around there with even a bit of iron in it seemed to 
come alive, rolling like a wave right over the blue figure. In less than 
a second the metallic dust had formed into a set of heavy bonds, the man 
restrained from the neck down. Powerful muscles strained as he fought to 
break free, fought to escape, but it was useless.

        &quot;Why was I not surprised to see you run away?&quot; Polaris asked, 
moving out of the shadows, her long green hair flowing around her 
shoulders.

        &quot;Do you want me to..&quot; Plasma offered, her sandy brown hair 
falling into her eyes.

        &quot;Please don&#39;t kill me,&quot; McCoy begged then pitifully, &quot;I wasn&#39;t 
working for Stryfe willingly, you have to know that!&quot;

        Plasma and Polaris exchanged a long look, then Polaris spoke up 
wryly, &quot;You certainly can lie with a straight face.&quot;

        &quot;Practice,&quot; McCoy flashed a smile.

        &quot;I was thinking,&quot; Plasma gave her lover a slight smile, &quot;it 
might be a bit more.. fitting, if we just turned him over to the 
authorities.&quot;

        &quot;Just what I was thinking,&quot; Polaris agreed, &quot;do you think you 
could you hit the bonds with a bit of plasma, fuse them solid?&quot;

        &quot;Done,&quot; Plasma&#39;s namesake flickered golden from her fingers and 
along the restraints, sealing McCoy&#39;s bonds without burning him. &quot;Good 
luck, McCoy,&quot; she added as the two women began to walk away, &quot;you&#39;re 
going to need it.&quot;

        McCoy cursed softly as he fought to get free, sweat pouring from 
his body as he struggled in his bonds. Polaris and Plasma had done a 
good job, locking him down do that he couldn&#39;t move arms or legs. He 
shifted, wiggling, then blinked as he slowly began to roll.

        &quot;Oh, bugger,&quot; McCoy muttered as he bounced uncontrollably down 
the hill, slamming right into a stubby tree, &quot;OW!&quot;

        There was a flash of light in the sky, and as McCoy lay there 
helplessly he prayed that Strife would win...

        Rogue met Stryfe in the sky, a shockwave hammering the other 
fliers back as she went toe to toe with the megalomaniac. Stryfe seemed 
startled as how easily she broke through his first telekinetic barrier, 
but he recovered quickly, thrusting her away.

        Oddly, Rogue only bobbed backwards a bit, then she threw him a 
dangerous smile. &quot;You&#39;ll have to do better than that,&quot; she grinned.

        &quot;What have you done..&quot; Stryfe looked startled.

        Rogue closed the distance again, her body shifting from flesh to 
metal. &#39;Thanks, Peter,&#39; she though as she used the combined strength of 
both of her and Colossus to hammer him down to the ground with a loud 
crash.

        Stryfe pulled himself up from the ground, a thin trickle of 
blood running from his nose, only to jerk back as claws nearly raked 
across his face. Lady Deathstryke pressed forward, trying to keep him 
off balance as she struck at him with her cybernetic claws. From the 
corner of her eye she saw a flicker of red, and leapt back and over.

        &quot;Got you!&quot; Thunderbird grinned, unleashing a wave of fire on 
him.

        Stryfe cried out in pain as his cheek burned a moment, too slow 
in shifting from a physical defense to an energy one. &quot;You will die for 
that,&quot; he growled, &quot;all of you will.&quot;

        &quot;Wanna bet?&quot; Rogue nailed him with Cyclops&#39; optic blast, the 
crimson energies punching right through his shields.

        Craka-Thoom! Storm called a massive burst of lightning down, the 
sand and dirt around the armored villain turning into glass from the 
heat. &quot;Yield, villain,&quot; Storm cried.

        &quot;Never,&quot; Stryfe cried, lashing out with a massive burst of power 
even as he reached up to try and stop the increasing blood flow from his 
nose.

        &quot;Sage,&quot; Lifeguard cried out in alarm. The golden skinned figure 
tossed herself in front of her pale lover, stretching her arms out to 
try to protect her. The energy seemed to stop in midair, Lifeguard&#39;s 
eyes flashed, and the energy boomeranged back!

        &quot;Incredible,&quot; Sage murmured, her eyes wide as Stryfe screamed in 
pain. The armored figure staggered, a tear of blood trickling down his 
face and she gasped, &quot;He&#39;s burning out. The graft of Nate Gray&#39;s DNA 
didn&#39;t fully take.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ve got to keep pressing him,&quot; Bishop opened up with his 
pistols, wishing there was some kind of energy available he could absorb 
and direct against Stryfe.

        &quot;Right,&quot; Thunderbird threw as much flame as possible, even as 
Psylocke summoned up her telekinesis to hammer at Stryfe too.

        &quot;He just won&#39;t give up,&quot; Psylocke muttered.

        &quot;You will all pay,&quot; Stryfe roared, his white hair falling out 
from his scalp, the power surging around him as he began to bleed from 
the ears, &quot;all of Xavier&#39;s brood will pay!&quot;

        &quot;Not in this century,&quot; Shadowcat phased her hand right through 
his head and directly into his brain&#39;s frontal lobe.

        Boom! There was what only could be described as a telekinetic 
explosion, with massive amounts of mental energy being released 
uncontrolled. Stryfe howled in agony, hurling Kitty backward, his armor 
falling away to reveal bleeding, torn flesh.

        &quot;Are you nuts?!&quot; Rogue demanded, catching her lover from midair.

        &quot;It hurt him,&quot; Kitty grinned, &quot;and yeah, probably. I don&#39;t think 
he can take much more, but when he does loose control.. it&#39;s going to be 
bad.&quot;

        Sakura looked up at the morning sky, watching dully as the 
flashes from Stryfe&#39;s battle appeared. It was all over, now, there was 
simply nothing left for her. A skittering sound, maybe that of an 
animal, caught her attention and she hoped her end would be quick.

        &quot;Sakura?&quot; Feral&#39;s familiar voice asked.

        The orange furred catgirl walked forward, coming into Sakura&#39;s 
line of view. She looked worried as she grew nearer, and Sakura wondered 
what she saw, what broken thing lay on the ground before her. &quot;Go away, 
it&#39;s over,&quot; she turned her face away.

        &quot;Well, Stryfe&#39;s going down,&quot; Feral agreed, the catgirl kneeling 
down beside Sakura to grab her arm, tugging her upwards.

        &quot;Let me go,&quot; Sakura cried, tears in her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m done!&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re still alive,&quot; Feral met her eyes, &quot;you can still get 
Pryde for what she&#39;s done to you, for what you told me she did to your 
master.&quot;

        &quot;She beat me,&quot; Sakura meat Feral&#39;s eyes as she said grimly, &quot;she 
defeated me in every way. I have nothing left, do you understand?&quot;

        Feral hesitated, clearly unsure of what to say. &quot;You&#39;ve got at 
least one thing left, Sakura,&quot; she finally said calmly.

        &quot;And what is that?&quot; Sakura shot back, ashamed of the tears on 
her cheeks.

        Feral reached out, catching those tears. Looking into Sakura&#39;s 
eyes she said simply, &quot;You sill have me, Sakura. If you want me, that 
is.&quot;

        Sakura looked at her blankly for a moment, then she turned her 
face slightly, enjoying that feeling. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she finally said 
softly, &quot;I guess I do.&quot;

        Feral smiled back, stroking that cheek. &quot;We&#39;d better get out of 
here,&quot; she said with a new urgency, &quot;Stryfe is about to take the big 
dirt nap, I think.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Sakura agreed, both women slipping away silently, 
ignoring the battle that raged not too far away.

        In the middle of that battle Rogue dove in towards where the 
battered Stryfe waited, ready to finish it. A quick conference with Sage 
and Kitty had brought forth the idea, but first she had to get them away 
from the others.

        &quot;You,&quot; Stryfe growled out, blood in his mouth.

        Rogue grabbed what was left of his cape, turning the attack 
aside with telekinesis borrowed from Jean Gray. With a heave she tossed 
him straight up, following at top speed as she switched powers once 
again.

        Stryfe recovered quickly, glaring as she rose up towards him. 
&quot;You think you can defeat me all alone?&quot; he wheezed.

        &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Rogue drove her fist as his face even as she called 
on the powers of Magneto.

        The human brain is very like a computer, running on electrical 
currents. An electromagnetic pulse plays havoc with any form of 
electronics, and that was exactly what rogue generated, focused in a 
pocket containing her and Stryfe. There was a moment when Stryfe 
realized what was happening, buy he was helpless as his higher brain 
functions completely shut down.

        And his borrowed powers turned on him, his will no longer able 
to hold them in check.

        The explosion lit up the sky, and some said it was visible all 
across Australia. Out of the blast Rogue was flung, her clothes aflame 
as she bounced off the turf, skidding to a stop with the assistance of 
Psylocke&#39;s telekinesis.

        &quot;Rogue!&quot; Kitty ran to her side, getting the flames out in a 
moment. The woman looked fine otherwise, but she lay there so still.

        &quot;Kitty,&quot; Rogue opened up her eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t feel so good,&quot; and 
with that she collapsed bonelessly into Kitty&#39;s arms.

        Klang! With a long crash a hunk of molten metal crashed to the 
ground nearby. As the X-Men rushed over smoke swirled around it, the 
twisted remains of Stryfe barely recognizable in the wreckage....</pre>
