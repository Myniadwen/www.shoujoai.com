<h1>The Genesis Quest (part 4 of 6)</h1>

<a href="../nonanime/genquest-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Gradually coming awake Joanna Cargill groaned to herself softly, feeling 
her body ache in places that she didn&#39;t know she had. The dark skinned 
young woman sat up in the bed, warily sweeping her surroundings with her 
eyes as she tried to figure out where she was and what had happened to 
her.

The bed chamber she was in was beautifully decorated, with fine 
furniture and a big bed that was probably queen sized. Decorated in rose 
and white the room reminded Joanna of a honeymoon suite, and she swiftly 
checked to see if she had gained a ring.

&#39;Thank goodness,&#39; Joanna smiled wryly as she got up, pulling a red sheet 
off the bed to cover her nakedness as she looked for a closet or some 
clothes while trying to figure out how exactly she had gotten here.

As far as she could recall only a few days ago Joanna had been captured 
by a branch of the Purifiers, a well armed band of religious zealots who 
believed that mutants were servants of the devil. Using powered armor 
and advanced weapons they had subdued her even with her strength and 
steel hard skin, then used some kind of gas to keep her unconscious.

Making her way to the door Joanna wondered, &#39;So how did I get from their 
secret encampment to here?&#39;

There was a tap on the door and a woman&#39;s voice called, &quot;Are you awake?&quot; 
She paused, &quot;I have lunch.&quot;

Joanna&#39;s stomach grumbled loudly, and she winced. &quot;I&#39;m up,&quot; she called, 
debating if she should jump the newcomer, &quot;come on in.&quot;

The blonde haired woman who carried a tray of food wore the unusual 
outfit of cut offs, western style shirt and boots, along with a cowboy 
hat. &quot;Nice to see you up and around,&quot; she noted, &quot;my name&#39;s Inez, but 
you can call me Outlaw.&quot;

Joanna&#39;s mouth watered at the ham, eggs and toast on the plate. &quot;I&#39;ve 
heard of you,&quot; she noted as Outlaw led her over to a side table, &quot;you&#39;re 
a mercenary.&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Outlaw agreed cheerfully, &quot;and proud of it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Joanna added as she sat down, wondering how long it had 
been since she had ate anything.

&quot;Dig in,&quot; Outlaw pulled over a chair, &quot;according to files we grabbed 
from the Purifiers, you&#39;ve been sedated for days.&quot;

&quot;That explains why I&#39;m so hungry now,&quot; Joanna said a bit apologetically 
to Outlaw as she tore into her food.

&quot;Good,&quot; Outlaw smiled slightly as she mused, &quot;my Daddy always said eager 
eatin&#39; is a sign of good cookin&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Is that a Texas accent I hear?&quot; Joanna said as she mopped up the last 
of her egg yolk with some toast.

&quot;Born and bread,&quot; Outlaw agreed. &quot;Still hungry?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Hell yes.&quot;

Outlaw chuckled, &quot;Let&#39;s get you some clothes then I&#39;ll hunt you up some 
more grub.&quot;

Keeping her sheet wrapped around her Joanna asked, &quot;I didn&#39;t see a 
closet, how...?&quot;

Outlaw walked over to a wall and tapped it, the barrier moving aside to 
reveal a high tech looking alcove. &quot;Would you like street clothes, your 
Frenzy outfit or maybe Acolyte gear?&quot; she asked with a impish smile.

&quot;Ah, Frenzy,&quot; Joanna said, watching intently.

A few keys were pressed, there was a moment&#39;s pause then a soft whuffing 
sound as the machine popped out a simple leather costume, a nearly 
perfect copy of the one Joanna wore as Frenzy. &quot;Here you go,&quot; Outlaw 
passed it over, &quot;and it&#39;s made from unstable molecules. It&#39;ll replicate 
your steel hard skin. &quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Joanna eagerly took the suit, &quot;how did she get a hold of that? I 
understand DR. Richards guards his patent very carefully.&quot;

&quot;Dunno,&quot; Outlaw admitted as she lead the way out of the room, entering 
into a large hallway. &quot;And I haven&#39;t really asked. Not my business,&quot; she 
shrugged.

They walked by a large, curved window, Joanna blinking in surprise as 
she saw the frigid wasteland outside. Wherever they were was in full 
blown winter, but in here it was warm and comfortable. Clearly, whoever 
owned this near palace was possessed of a immense degree of power and 
wealth.

&#39;Just the sort of thing I&#39;ve been looking for,&#39; Joanna admitted to 
herself thoughtfully.

Pushing open a large set of double doors Outlaw said in her typical 
drawl, &quot;The kitchen&#39;s just behind this mess hall.&quot;

&quot;Do you have to call it a mess hall?&quot; the amused voice came from the 
open kitchen door. As they neared they could see a redheaded woman 
wearing a simple green bodysuit, an white apron thrown over it.

&quot;Miz Madelyne, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call it 
a duck,&quot; Outlaw shrugged casually.

Madelyne rolled her eyes. &quot;I see you&#39;re awake,&quot; she addressed Joanna, &quot;I 
hope you&#39;re recovering from your ordeal?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Joanna agreed, wondering who this woman bustling around 
the kitchen making food.

&quot;I&#39;m Madelyne Pryor,&quot; she introduced herself as she casually flipped an 
egg, &quot;and I&#39;m your host here.&quot;

&quot;Ehh?&quot; Joanna blurted.

Outlaw chuckled as she sat down at a larger tale, &quot;Sorry, I shoulda 
warned ya pardner.&quot;

&quot;Watch out when she does that thick accent,&quot; Madelyne quietly warned, 
&quot;it means she&#39;s probably bull shitting again,&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Outlaw protested.

&quot;Do you all have to be so loud?&quot; the black haired woman complained as 
she walked in, her clothes messy yet still somehow sexy too.

&quot;Sorry Selene,&quot; Madelyne said as she kissed her cheek as she passed her 
to grab a glass of orange juice.

&#39;Interesting,&#39; Joanna noted as she watched them interact in such a oddly 
informal way. &#39;It&#39;s nice, though,&#39; she mused as she drank a cup of 
coffee.

&quot;Those two really make me regret my single state,&quot; Outlaw mused as she 
casually got herself seconds, loading up her plate like it was going out 
of style.

&quot;We could solve that,&quot; Selene leered.

Outlaw have her a look, &quot;I don&#39;t do threesomes.&quot;

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Selene murmured, &quot;I&#39;m certain I could cure your attitude 
problem.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Madelyne said as she set her own plate down, &quot;those two like to 
scrap.&quot;

Joanna ate some food, debating how to ask the questions she had. Finally 
deciding bluntness might be her best course she asked, &quot;Not that I don&#39;t 
appreciate it, but why did you and your people rescue me?&quot;

&quot;The fact that you were a mutant in trouble wasn&#39;t enough of a reason?&quot; 
Madelyne asked, smiling at her wryly.

&quot;To be honest, no,&quot; Joanna admitted.

Madelyne smiled suddenly, &quot;Very sharp.&quot; She drank some orange juice, &quot;I 
rescued you because you need help almost as much as I do.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Joanna looked curious.

&quot;You&#39;ve tangled with the X-men, as have I,&quot; Madelyne said mildly, &quot;and I 
believe they may plan a preemptive strike against me, despite my having 
left the villainous life.&quot;

&quot;You want bodyguards,&quot; Joanna realized.

&quot;Bodyguards and agents,&quot; Madelyne agreed, &quot;depending on how the 
situation develops.&quot;

&quot;Sign on,&quot; Outlaw said to her cheerfully as she finished the last of her 
sausages, &quot;she pays top mercenary rates.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not expecting me to do it out of the goodness of my heart?&quot; 
Joanna asked Madelyne.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Madelyne shook her head, &quot;the worker is worth his wages, I 
always say.&quot;

Joanna tapped the table, &quot;And if I say no?&quot;

&quot;You finish your breakfast, I call our teleporter Ariel and send you 
wherever you want to go,&quot; Madelyne said, &quot;no hard feelings.&quot;

Joanna met her eyes, silently weighing her words. Her gut said that the 
woman was being honest, and more importantly this would be her first 
paying gig in a while. &quot;All right,&quot; she nodded, &quot;you&#39;ve got me.&quot;</pre>
