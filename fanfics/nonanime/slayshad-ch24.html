<h1>Slayer and Shadow (part 24 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Vampires burned easily, especially if you used the
right methods. The team had trapped the vampires in
the wrecked building, made sure anyone innocent was
clear, then proceeded to torch the place. Only a few
attempted to break out, and the rising sun did them in
as efficiently as the fire would have.

&quot;I love it when a plan comes together,&quot; Buffy Summers
noted, her short blonde hair falling around her face.

&quot;Don&#39;t start quoting the &#39;A-team&#39; please.&quot; Faith said
dryly, holding her crossbow at the ready in case any
more vamps ran out, &quot;or I may have to kill you.&quot; She
paused, &quot;Or start in the quotes myself.&quot;

&quot;Besides,&quot; Tara noted calmly, a bit of a amused
twinkle in her eyes as the slightly heavy-set witch
put away the spell casting materials that she used to
start the fire, &quot;wouldn&#39;t that line be more suited to
Giles?&quot;

Rupert Giles pushed up his glasses, a frown on his
face as he said, &quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking
about.&quot;

Staying in the shade of a nearby building Willow
chuckled as she said, &quot;You&#39;re probably better off not
knowing.&quot;

&quot;I pity the fool,&quot; Faith added, chuckling.

&quot;Oooh, you with a mohawk?&quot; Buffy winced, &quot;Bad mental
image.&quot;

&quot;Could we maybe keep our minds on business?&quot; Giles
rolled his eyes discreetly.

&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Willow chuckled softly.

A few moments later there was a sudden crash as a
desperate vamp burst out of the flames, his body
wreathed in fire. &quot;You won&#39;t get Trick that easy,&quot; he
started before being cut off by a hail of crossbow
bolts and a quickly chanted spell.

&quot;Wanna bet?&quot; Tara noted, feeling a certain amount
of... regret.

What they were doing out here this morning was, in
essence, sending a warning to Amy and her girlfriend,
Drusilla, a warning they weren&#39;t even sure was going
to work. However, since they still had very little
idea of the two vampire&#39;s ultimate intentions, this
was the best move they could make so far.

&quot;We&#39;ll find them,&quot; Faith said quietly as she squeezed
Tara&#39;s shoulder comfortingly, &quot;it&#39;ll just take some
time.&quot;

Tara smiled back as she gently kissed Faith, &quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Buffy said briskly, &quot;are we finished, you
think?&quot;

Giles pushed up his glasses as the flames began to die
down without much of anything to burn. &quot;Only a
exceptional vampire could survive this long,&quot; he
noted, &quot;and there&#39;s no sign of movement. Do you sense
anything, Willow?&quot;

Willow stood in the shadows, her eyes closed a moment
as she let her vampiric senses and other mental gifts
sweep outward. Finally she looked up, &quot;I&#39;m not picking
up anything Giles. I think they&#39;re done.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Buffy sighed, &quot;they&#39;re reopening the high
school today, and I want to walk there with Dawn on
her first day.&quot;

&quot;Aww,&quot; Faith teased, &quot;isn&#39;t that special.&quot;

&quot;Faith,&quot; Tara gave her lover a gently scolding look,
seeing the actual worry in Buffy&#39;s eyes. Sending your
little sister to school was hard enough, sending her
off in a hellmouth haunted city like this would be
more so.

&quot;Sorry, B,&quot; Faith sighed.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Buffy flashed a slight smile as she
said, &quot;at least I know someone will be watching over
her.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Tara blinked.

&quot;Miss Calendar is starting as their computer studies
teacher,&quot; Buffy said with some amusement, &quot;though how
a witch got into computers is beyond me.&quot;

&quot;Jenny is a techno-pagan, I believe,&quot; Giles said just
a bit stiffly. He sighed, &quot;I suppose I had best go get
ready, too.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re working too, G-man?&quot; Faith asked with a grin.

&quot;I suppose you&#39;ve heard,&quot; Giles agreed, &quot;I&#39;ve been
rehired as the Librarian, now that the building has
mostly been rebuilt.&quot;

&quot;So, are we going to have problems getting a hold of
you during school hours?&quot; Buffy had to ask him.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Giles noted, &quot;I think you and
Faith could pass as students.&quot; He paused, &quot;A bit
scruffy students, but passable.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; both Faith and Buffy protested.

&quot;Come on love,&quot; Willow called with a soft chuckle,
&quot;we&#39;d better get going back to the mansion. I bet
Dawn&#39;s having kittens at this point.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Tara called as both girls headed out.

Traveling the tunnels beneath the city wasn&#39;t terribly
pleasant, but in fact it was faster than the roads and
safer... at least, safer for a vampire slayer and her
vampire companion. The few unaffiliated vamps knew not
to bother them, and the ones connected to the two
Queens had learned the hard way not to cross them.

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Willow casually moved aside the massive
stone block in their basement that connected to the
tunnels.

Buffy hopped up gracefully, &quot;Thanks, love.&quot;

As both hurried upstairs they found Dawn pacing the
living room, her long brown hair swishing around her.
&quot;Giles keep you late again?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Willow said as Buffy hurried off to shower
and change into something not smelling of fire, ash
and blood. She sat in the dimly lit room as she gently
asked Dawn, &quot;Are you ready for this?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I think so,&quot; Dawn agreed, &quot;you guys and Giles
help me get school supplies, and I&#39;m bringing a wooden
stake just in case.&quot;

&quot;Wearing a cross too?&quot; Willow asked.

Dawn pulled it out from under her t-shirt, &quot;Yeah,
though I worry the locals will think I&#39;m a holy roller
or something.&quot;

&quot;Trust me,&quot; Willow said dryly, &quot;considering this
town&#39;s reputation, I bet almost everyone will be
wearing them.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got that right,&quot; Buffy said as she trotted in
dressed in a simple blouse and shirt, her hair still
damp from the shower.

&quot;Nice,&quot; Dawn conceded, &quot;toning down the butch image a
bit?&quot;

&quot;Dawn!&quot; Buffy frowned.

&quot;What, you don&#39;t think jeans and t-shirts all day
isn&#39;t butch?&quot; Dawn asked pointedly.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t get into that argument, love,&quot; Willow said
before Buffy could start. She smiled, &quot;Besides, you
two can fight it out on your way there.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Buffy admitted as she and Dawn headed to the
door. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a few hours, tops,&quot; she called
as they left.

&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting,&quot; Willow answered as she yawned
slightly. Getting up she made her way back to her and
Buffy&#39;s bedroom, laying down in the dark for a nap.
&#39;Hope those two don&#39;t get into too much trouble,&#39; she
smiled as she lay down.

The street was bright and the sun shown down, the city
looking oddly innocent in the summer daylight. Of
course the years long rampage of the Master had left
scars if you knew where to look, one of the biggest
being the vampire attacks that had closed the
highschool shortly before Buffy arrived. Now, in a
brave move the city was reopening the school for the
decidedly nervous population.

&quot;Nice looking building,&quot; Dawn finally murmured as they
reached the school itself.

Buffy studied it, thinking a moment about her years
hunting vampires without home or roots. &quot;It&#39;s a
school,&quot; she smiled slightly, &quot;but yeah, it&#39;s not too
bad.&quot;

Dawn hesitated a moment, &quot;Do you think it&#39;s going to
be safe?&quot;

&quot;With Miss Calendar and Giles there?&quot; Buffy smiled,
trying to project confidence. &quot;From what I understand
Miss Calendar&#39;s also fixed up a kind of defense around
the school to keep vampires out, too,&quot; she added.

&quot;Which just leaves all the other critters out there,&quot;
Dawn noted wryly.

Buffy squeezed her shoulder, &quot;You&#39;ve got a cellphone
and my number. You spot anything odd, call me.&quot;

Dawn smiled up at her, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;All right folks,&quot; the tall black skinned man smiled
as he guided students to the doors, &quot;no loitering
please. Classes start soon.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pick you up after class,&quot; Buffy murmured as she
hugged Dawn.

Dawn chuckled, &quot;Thanks mom.&quot;</pre>
