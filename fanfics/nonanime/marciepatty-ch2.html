<h1>Marcie and Patty (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/marciepatty-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Peppermint Patty frowned as she saw the new sign on the familiar stand 
outside the Van Pelt house. &quot;Psychiatric help six dollars?&quot; she asked 
incredulously, &quot;What happened to five cents?&quot;

&quot;Hey, we&#39;re in the ninth grade now,&quot; Lucy pointed out from behind the 
booth, &quot;You have to deal with the costs of inflation and overhead.&quot;

&quot;Overhead?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Lucy answered as she leaned against the booth, &quot;After all, I 
have to lug this booth back and forth from the garage in the back out 
here to the curb. Don&#39;t you think I deserve some sort of monetary 
compensation for that?&quot; she asked with a smile as she held out a jar to 
Patty. The tomboy rolled her eyes as she fished out a five and four 
quarters from her pocket and deposited it into the jar. &quot;Mmmm...&quot; Lucy 
squealed happily, &quot;Money...&quot;

&quot;A- Hem.&quot;

&quot;Oh, right. So what seemes to be the problem?&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;m in love with my best friend.&quot;

&quot;And let me guess; the blockhead either doesn&#39;t know or doesn&#39;t love you 
back, right? Good grief girl, you&#39;re hardly unique in that, you know? I 
can remember back when Schroeder was playing hard to get...&quot;

&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Peppermint Patty interrupted, &quot;That&#39;s not it at all. My 
best friend is in love with me too.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Lucy asked a bit confused, &quot;Then I don&#39;t understand, what&#39;s 
the problem?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Marcie.&quot;

&quot;What, Marcie&#39;s upset you&#39;re spending time with someone romantically 
instead of hanging out with her?&quot;

&quot;No, Marcie&#39;s the friend I AM spending time with romantically. &quot;

A moment of silence hung in the air between the two. Then, Lucy got up 
from behind the booth, walked over to Peppermint Patty, and put a hand 
on her shoulder.

&quot;You&#39;re in love with Marcie?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;And Marcie&#39;s in love with you?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Patty said, &quot;I guess that makes me a thespian, huh doc?&quot;

&quot;Actually, the correct term is &#39;lesbian,&#39;&quot; Lucy responded. &quot;Look, when 
the two of you are together, are you both happy?&quot;

A blush passed over Patty&#39;s cheeks as she nodded her head.

&quot;Then I don&#39;t see any problem with it.&quot;

Patty looked taken aback, &quot;You mean I don&#39;t have a problem?&quot;

&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t say that; the whole sandal look went out with Ben Hur, 
and you look like you have some split ends in the back, but as far as 
being a lesbian goes, no.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Sure. Hey, it&#39;s two-thousand seven, you got to change with the times. I 
did,&quot; she said, pointing once again to the six-dollar sign.

&quot;Wow... I&#39;m normal!&quot; Patty said, grinning from ear to ear as she stood 
up from the booth, &quot;Gee, thanks doc.&quot; And with that, Peppermint Patty 
got up and cheerfully left the Psychiatric Help booth.

&quot;Well,&quot; Lucy said with a self-satisfied smile, &quot;There goes a happy 
customer. I wish getting my blockhead of a brother to give up his stupid 
blanket had been as easy as that.&quot;</pre>
