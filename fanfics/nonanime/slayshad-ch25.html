<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>&quot;Damn them!&quot; Amy snarled, the blonde in full vamp-face
as the slim young woman ripped the stuffing out of a
fine old chair. The house they were staying in
belonged to a upper class man with a thing for
streetwalkers and not enough brains to check his dates
for fangs. Now he lay rotting in the basement, and Dru
and Ami had the run of the place.

Dru was sitting back, her dark hair flowing down her
back, dressed in a gothic style for her own amusement.
&quot;Did we lose Trick too?&quot; she ask her lieutenant, her
black gloved hands languid yet strangely deadly.

Justine and Julia Cooper, the lovely reddish brown
haired twins, gave each other nervous looks as Julia
said, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, though I understand Trick lasted
longer than most.&quot;

Amy ground her teeth, then closed her eyes. &quot;Go, now,&quot;
she ordered coldly, watching with fury in her eyes as
the two vampires fled. With a muffled curse she
gestured to the fireplace and willed it to burn,
flames roaring to life to match her fury.

&quot;I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t burn them both,&quot; Dru noted
as she came up behind Amy and kissed her neck
lingeringly.

Amy moaned softly, tilting her head back at that
familiar touch. &quot;If I start to kill the bringers of
bad news,&quot; Amy said, &quot;they&#39;ll stop telling me the
truth.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Dru let her hands rise up the black blouse Amy
was wearing and cup her breasts, &quot;so what do you want
to do about this?&quot;

&quot;I want to kill them all,&quot; Amy hissed softly in
pleasure as she added, &quot;break their bones and suck the
marrow out!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my beloved,&quot; Dru agreed, &quot;but how?&quot;

Amy turned to kiss Dru fiercly, stroking her back then
sliding down to cup her ass through her short black
skirt. &quot;That&#39;s the problem,&quot; Amy growled as she nipped
at Dru&#39;s neck, &quot;those damn slayers are too much for
our normal soldiers...&quot;

&quot;Then maybe,&quot; Dru cooed softly, &quot;it&#39;s time for
something a little more unusual?&quot;

Meanwhile, a impromptu debriefing was going on at the
Summers household. &quot;God it was boring,&quot; Dawn
complained as the brown haired girl sat on the couch,
&quot;it&#39;s like they assumed we forgot everything over
summer.&quot;

&quot;Some students do,&quot; Giles noted mildly, dressed in her
suit from working in the library. He pushed up his
glasses, &quot;Gave six tours today, and I&#39;ll have six more
everyday till we finish with every home room.&quot;

&quot;I still think it would be easier if you digitized the
whole library,&quot; Jenny Calendar teased as she sat
beside him.

&quot;Not those idiot boxes again,&quot; Giles sighed.

&quot;I think the TV is the idiot box,&quot; Buffy noted with
some amusement.

Willow looked equally amused, &quot;Computers are useful
for LOTs of stuff, Giles. I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t use
one as a Watcher.&quot;

&quot;Ganging up on me?&quot; Giles looked pained.

&quot;Don&#39;t look at me,&quot; Faith commented from where she sat
near the roaring fire, &quot;I&#39;ve only used one once to
find porn.&quot;

&quot;Faith!&quot; Tara scolded, the other woman still looking
faintly uncomfortable there under the roof of Willow
and Buffy.

Dawn giggled, &quot;Gee, that must explain all the guys in
the computer labs...&quot;

Jenny shook her head, &quot;Trust me, they&#39;re locked out on
porn sites.&quot;

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Buffy murmured.

Willow bapped Buffy gently on the arm, &quot;Be nice.&quot;

Tara shook her head, smiling softly. If someone had
told her a few months ago she&#39;d be here, sharing
laughter with a vampire, she would have called them
insane. &#39;Then again,&#39; Tara conceded, &#39;Willow is no
ordinary vampire.&#39;

Giles took off his glasses, wiping them with a cloth
from his pocket. &quot;I hate to bring up business,&quot; he
said, &quot;but are we patrolling tonight?&quot;

&quot;Willow and I are,&quot; Buffy agreed. Her eyes looked
impish, &quot;I suppose you teachers better hurry to bed so
you&#39;re ready for classes tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Are you implying I can&#39;t keep up?&quot; Jenny asked, mock
offended.

&quot;Well, old folks like you do need your rest,&quot; Dawn
winked.

&quot;Old?&quot; Giles lifted a offended eyebrow as he put his
glasses back on.

&quot;Positively ancient,&quot; Faith agreed cheerfully, &quot;why,
we might have to bring your walker along on the next
patrol.&quot;

&quot;Whatever happened to the traditional respect a
Watcher gets?&quot; Jenny wondered aloud.

&quot;With this group?&quot; Willow chuckled softly, &quot;Tough
luck.&quot;

Tara shook her head, smiling. &quot;I think Faith and I
will join you,&quot; she said a bit more seriously, &quot;just
in case.&quot;

Giles looked at her curiously, &quot;Do you think there&#39;ll
be trouble?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got no premonitions, if that&#39;s what you mean,&quot;
Tara answered him, &quot;I&#39;m just feeling a bit uneasy.&quot;

&quot;Better bring extra stakes,&quot; Buffy mused.

Later, the four of them ventured out into the night
even as they watched Giles and Jenny drive off in
Giles&#39; old car. &quot;Think they&#39;ll be all right in that
beater?&quot; Faith wondered skeptically.

&quot;It may look like a beater,&quot; Willow noted as she
adjusted her long leather coat to hide her weapons,
&quot;but Jenny&#39;s enchanted it a great deal.&quot;

Tara looked at her in surprise, then reminded herself
that Willow had once been a witch. &quot;Yes,&quot; she agreed,
&quot;a vampire would have to be suicidal to attack them.&quot;

THOOM! There was a massive blow, the ground around
them rumbljng as they looked around wildly. &quot;Giles?!&quot;
Buffy yelped, running up the road.

&quot;Wait damn it,&quot; Faith growled, her and willow soon
catching up as Tara fell a bit behind. They came
around the corner and stumbled a bit, all of them a
bit surprised at what waited for them.

&quot;Well,&quot; Tara panted, &quot;you don&#39;t see that every day.&quot;

The troll stood in the middle of the road, his
greenish skin clashing with a brown beard and rough
leather clothes. He stood nearly a foot taller than
the Slayers, and his nearly inhuman body rippled with
muscles. In his hand he carried a massive hammer,
likely the weapon that had drawn their attention in
the first place.

Just beyond him Giles&#39; battered green car was rammed
up against a tree but Giles appeared unharmed as he
tended to a stunned and lightly bleeding Jenny. He
looked up and called, &quot;Buffy, it&#39;s a trap!&quot;

&quot;I kind of guessed that,&quot; Buffy said as they began to
warily space themselves out around their massive foe.

&quot;I am Olaf!&quot; the troll declared, &quot;Now where are you
hiding her?!&quot;

&quot;Hiding who?&quot; Willow asked reasonably.

&quot;You know who!&quot; Olaf roared before hammering the earth
again, sending a shockwave right through them.

Without even thinking about it Faith drew her crossbow
and fired, sending out a steel tipped shaft that
glanced off his hard skin. &quot;Well crap,&quot; Faith growled.

Tara began to chant, her hands swiftly moving through
arcane gestures as she formed a spell. &quot;Adept!&quot; with a
single word she released the power, a bolt of force
flying from her hands to blast the troll, staggering
it.

&quot;Ooof!&quot; Olaf nearly fell backward then grinned, &quot;You
must know her! She did things like that too.&quot;

Willow swiftly drew a sword from beneath her coat and
attacked, swinging at exposed skin beneath the leather
armor. &#39;He&#39;s got to have a weak spot somewhere,&#39; she
thought grimly, chipping away.

Buffy followed her in carrying a axe, swinging with
grim determination. &quot;We don&#39;t have whoever you want,&quot;
she snarled.

&quot;The vampires promised me...&quot; Olaf started, &quot;urk!&quot;

Faith&#39;s crossbow bolt soared into his mouth, piercing
the soft tissues within and sending blood pouring
free. &quot;Willow, now!&quot; Tara yelled.

Swiftly moving in front of the badly wounded troll
Willow took her sword in both hands and struck up on
an angle with all her vampiric strength, driving it up
into the mouth and through the comparetively weaker
bones of the inner skull. The troll made a weak
sighing noise and collapsed backward, laying still on
the deserted road.

&quot;Giles!&quot; Faith ran by the troll to where he sat,
carefully cradling Jenny&#39;s head in his lap.

&quot;We&#39;re fine,&quot; Giles said as Tara knelt down to examine
Jenny, &quot;trolls regenerate! You&#39;ve got to destroy the
body.&quot;

&quot;Tara?&quot; Buffy asked as Willow warily watched over the
troll&#39;s corpse.

Tara turned Jenny&#39;s face and gazed into her eyes
before saying, &quot;Looks like a concussion. She should be
fine.&quot;

&quot;It moved,&quot; Buffy warned.

Tara hurried over as she began to chant, summoning her
power as she formed the spell in her mind. With a word
and gesture the still impaled troll began to burn,
blazing brighter and brighter as she fanned the
flames. After a moment it was gone, only ashes
remaining...
