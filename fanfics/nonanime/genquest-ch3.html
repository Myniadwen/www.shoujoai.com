<h1>The Genesis Quest (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/genquest-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;All right Mr. Summers,&quot; Evangeline Whedon asked briskly as the black 
haired woman sat in the office of the headmaster of Xavier&#146;s Institute, 
&quot;do you want to hear the bad news first or the worse news?&quot;

&quot;Worse news,&quot; Scott Summers answered, his brown hair falling into his 
ruby quartz covered eyes.

&quot;You&#146;re the glass half empty type?&quot; Evangeline asked as she adjusted her 
tie, her white blouse hugging her slim body.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Scott sighed. &quot;So?&quot;

&quot;You and Jean Grey are being sued in the wrongful death of Madelyne 
Pryor,&quot; Evangeline said seriously.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Scott blinked, sitting up in surprise.

&quot;You and your wife are being sued,&quot; Evangeline calmly repeated, &quot;by a 
woman claiming to be Madelyne&#146;s biological sister.&quot;

Emma Frost got up from where she was leaning against a couch, &quot;But 
Madelyne was just a clone, created by Mister Sinister. She couldn&#146;t have 
a sister.&quot;

&quot;True, but the judge involved doesn&#146;t know that,&quot; Evangelyne noted, &quot;and 
it&#146;s going to be hell to prove for us.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Scott sighed. &quot;And the bad news you mentioned?&quot;

&quot;Jean Grey is filing for divorce,&quot; Evangeline said calmly as she handed 
him several more papers, &quot;on the grounds of infidelity.&quot;

&quot;We knew that was coming,&quot; Emma sighed.

In the aftermath of the outing of the school, Emma Frost had offered her 
assistance as a therapist to Scott Summers, helping him overcome thr 
trauma he still carried after his possession by the mutant Apocolypse. 
However, during those sessions Emma had fallen for Scott, eventually 
drawing him into a sexual relationship, one that Jean found out about.

&quot;I still can&#146;t believe that Jean convinced the Professor to move the 
students to the old Massachusetts Academy with her as headmaster,&quot; Scott 
mused, a frown on his face.

&quot;It&#146;s not all that surprising,&quot; Evangeline pointed out reasonably, 
&quot;Xavier&#146;s school is a target now that you&#146;re all outed. The 
Massachusetts Academy is a bit lower profile.&quot; Briskly she left copies 
of the various documents on Scott&#146;s desk, &quot;I assume I&#146;ll be representing 
you in the wrongful death case?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Scott nodded.

&quot;You&#146;ll need to get a separate lawyer for the divorce, however,&quot; 
Evangeline said as she headed for the door.

&quot;Why?&quot; Emma asked dryly.

Evangeline gave Emma a dangerous look, &quot;Because I&#146;ve already been 
retained as Jean&#146;s lawyer in that case.&quot;

&quot;Ready to go?&quot; Marie D&#146;Ancanto asked as Evangeline left the office. The 
brown haired woman wore a simple business suit, the only odd element 
being the eye-patch she wore on the left side of her face.

&quot;Business is done, yeah,&quot; Evangeline agreed as both women walked through 
the oddly quiet halls of the Xavier Institute.

With most of the students gone the place was eerily quiet, and even the 
X-Men&#146;s numbers had been depleted by the split in ranks. Several major 
members, including Beast, Archangel and Colossus, had left along with 
Jean to help teach and protect the students.

&quot;How did Scotty take the news?&quot; the blonde haired young man asked as he 
strode up, his black costume shimmering with waves of white light.

&quot;About as well as could be expected, Alex,&quot; Evangeline answered wryly.

Alex Summers, also known as Havok, looked at Marie with a somewhat 
disapproving look, &quot;Nice to see you too, Miss D&#146;Ancanto.&quot;

&quot;Charmed,&quot; Marie answered dryly.

Alex&#146;s lips twitched up in a smile. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he sighed as he explained, 
&quot;it&#146;s been a rough couple of days.&quot;

&quot;I can understand that,&quot; Marie agreed. &quot;So who ended up staying here 
with Scott?&quot;

&quot;Me,&quot; Alex smiled wryly, &quot;Northstar, Wolverine, Bishop, Cable, Stacy X, 
Juggernaut, Foxx, Husk and Chamber.&quot;

Evangeline sighed, &quot;well, let&#146;s hope none of the big baddies decide to 
hit the Mansion. If they do, it could get VERY bad.&quot;

&quot;You got that right,&quot; the fur covered young woman noted as she slinked 
up to them. A smile, &quot;Name&#146;s Foxx.&quot; She looked oddly naked even with her 
fur, her full breasts bouncing slightly and bits of darker fur marking 
her nipples and crotch.

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Evangeline nodded, &quot;new recruit?&quot;

&quot;I was in Xavier&#146;s covert program like Sage and Stacy-X,&quot; Foxx 
explained, &quot;but with everything that&#146;s happened I thought I&#146;d better 
help out here.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sure they&#146;re glad to have you,&quot; Marie said, feeling faintly 
disturbed by the girl&#146;s unabashed sensuality.

&quot;Well, we&#146;d better get going,&quot; Evangeline said. She looked at Alex, &quot;Are 
the protesters still blocking the front gate?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Alex sighed. He smiled grimly and asked, &quot;Do you want a few of 
us to clear the way for you?&quot;

&quot;Actually, I have a better idea,&quot; Evangeline said as she headed for the 
back yard.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Marie groaned.

&quot;What&#146;s wrong?&quot; Foxx asked as they went out the back door to where the 
pool waited.

&quot;Just watch,&quot; Marie sighed.

With a remarkable degree of casualness Evangeline stripped, her skirt, 
top and suit jacket hitting the floor one after the other. Then the 
woman took a few steps away and began to change. In just a few moments 
where a woman stood, a honest to goodness dragon crouched comfortably on 
the grass.

&quot;Holy...&quot; Foxx blurted, taking a few steps backward in awe.

&quot;Impressive, isn&#146;t she?&quot; Alex grinned.

&quot;Ready to go?&quot; Evangeline the dragon asked as Marie finished collecting 
her clothes.

Marie shook her head as she climbed up on Evangeline, &quot;You should give 
people some warning when you&#146;re going to use your mutant power.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Foxx,&quot; Evangelene said as the dragon turned and loped around the 
buildings and towards the front gate. The anti-mutant protesters took 
one look at the giant dragon bearing down at them and cleared the way 
hastily.

Meanwhile, back in the office Scott sighed happily as Emma rubbed his 
shoulders from behind. &quot;It&#146;ll be alright, Scott,&quot; she said briskly.

&quot;We&#146;ll need to call in the reserves,&quot; Scott sighed, &quot;shore up our 
numbers a bit. We also need to make sure Jean has enough people to 
defend the Academy too.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m tempted to let Jean do it on her own,&quot; Emma snipped, &quot;but I suppose 
we must, if only for the students sake.&quot;

&quot;Emma,&quot; Scott sighed as he squeezed her hand, &quot;you&#146;re just annoyed that 
the Cookoos went along with Jean.&quot;

&quot;Teenage rebellion,&quot; Emma sniffed, &quot;they&#146;ll be back.&quot;

Scott sighed as she eased a tight muscle. &quot;With Ororo running her team 
and Excalibur over in England, who do we have available to call in?&quot;

&quot;We could try tempting a few of them back into the fold,&quot; Emma offered.

&quot;Unwritten rule,&quot; Scott half smiled, &quot;no poaching from other X-squads.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Emma smiled. &quot;We could move Karma back up to full X-Men status,&quot; 
she suggested.

&quot;They didn&#146;t go with Jean?&quot; Scott seemed surprised.

&quot;No,&quot; Emma said wickedly, &quot;in fact she seemed annoyed at being snubbed 
when Jean pulled the kids out.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Scott nodded, &quot;and I got a communication from the Underground. 
Apparently Fantomex and a few others want to rejoin.&quot;

&quot;We could use them,&quot; Emma nodded, &quot;it&#146;s not a healthy time to be a 
mutant.&quot;</pre>
