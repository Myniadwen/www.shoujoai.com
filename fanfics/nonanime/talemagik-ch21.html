haired British colonel looking distinctly worried as
they stood there in the rising storm.

&quot;Fascinating,&quot; Allistaire murmured, the colonel&#39;s twin
looking around him eagerly.

&quot;How can there be an Anti-Phoenix?&quot; Kitty demanded,
leaning on Illyanna for support.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jean answered, the fiery haired young
woman meeting their eyes directly, &quot;I just know that
is what it is, instinctively.&quot;

&quot;Any idea if it&#39;s going to be here for awhile?&quot;
Illyanna asked warily, the blonde woman&#39;s soulsword
shining in her hand.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Rachel offered seriously, the young
redhead standing nearby her mother, &quot;I don&#39;t believe
it&#39;s fully awake just yet.&quot;

&quot;It tried to drain Ms. Pryde while asleep?&quot; Alysande
asked, raising an eyebrow.

Jean nodded slightly, &quot;Probably the amulet forged a
connection, one strong enough that it instinctively
attempted to feed.&quot;

Allistaire looked at the others thoughtfully a moment.
&quot;We have a shelter set up nearby,&quot; he offered, &quot;why
not go inside and have a spot of tea before we do
anything else?&quot;

&quot;Not a bad idea,&quot; Kitty admitted tiredly.

The shelter the Weird Happenings Organization had set
up wasn&#39;t far from the archeological site, a
preconstructed building that had been hauled over to
the site. Within heaters staved off the chill storm
while a portable stove heated up drinks or food,
whatever might be needed.

Illyanna quickly ushered Kitty to a seat, grabbing
some donuts and tea for her to eat. The others settled
into places around the long rectangular table a bit
more slowly, the Stuarts up at one end and the
Americans scattered around the rest of the area.

&quot;You came into contact with this... thing,&quot; Alysande
finally asked Kitty, &quot;can you give us any impressions
on it?&quot;

Kitty cupped the drink in her hands, &quot;It&#39;s old, but
not like the Old Ones we&#39;ve encountered.&quot; She smiled
wryly as she munched on a donut, &quot;It almost feels
human, but it&#39;s been overlaid with an almost inhuman
hunger.&quot;

&quot;Vampire?&quot; Allistaire asked eagerly.

Jean gave him an odd look, &quot;No, not in that sense. At
best it&#39;s hungry for pure energy, attempting to become
what it was meant to be.&quot;

&quot;You know more than you&#39;re telling,&quot; Illyanna&#39;s voice
had gone flat, dangerous as she continued on, &quot;I am
not providing any more help until you tell us what&#39;s
going on.&quot;

&quot;Giving you that sort of information could change the
timeline,&quot; Rachel swiftly stepped up to defend Jean.

&quot;Bullshit,&quot; Illyanna snapped back, &quot;your very presence
in the past has already changed the timeline
irrevocably.&quot;

&quot;Are you following this?&quot; Alysande asked quietly.

&quot;Think so,&quot; Allistaire answered softly, &quot;looks like
both redheads are time displaced, probably from the
same future era.&quot;

&quot;Too bad we can&#39;t ask some questions,&quot; Alysande said
wryly.

&quot;Bad idea,&quot; Allistaire agreed.

&quot;That&#39;s enough,&quot; Jean said, putting a hand on Rachel&#39;s
arm. She looked into Illyanna&#39;s eyes and saw cold
fury, a lover defending her bride, and knew she was
not getting away with any evasions or half truths.
&quot;The Anti-Phoenix is a weapon,&quot; she explained, &quot;a
force created to be used against the true Phoenix at
the proper time.&quot;

Kitty made a face, &quot;It&#39;s... it did remind me of things
the X-Men have said about Dark Phoenix, the passion
and hunger for destruction.&quot;

Jean made a face at that, &quot;If only it were that
simple.&quot; A deep breath, &quot;Millennia ago a wizard
successfully tore a piece out of the Phoenix Force,
binding it into a corpse to be reshaped over the years
into the force beneath that circle of stones.&quot;

&quot;Your sorcerer enemy from the future,&quot; Illyanna said
flatly, &quot;the one that Rachel was sent into the past to
try and avoid.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Rachel nodded, &quot;I don&#39;t think your future
selves expected a manifestation of the enemy in this
era, too.&quot;

&quot;Can the Anti-Phoenix be rejoined with the original
Phoenix Force?&quot; Kitty looked over at Jean to ask.

&quot;If it was purified of the sorcerer&#39;s influence,
possibly,&quot; Jean answered.

&quot;Why aren&#39;t you naming who this sorcerer is?&quot;
Allistaire asked curiously.

&quot;Names have power,&quot; Illyanna gave him a look like he
was an idiot, &quot;speaking it could draw his attention
here, or even fully awake that thing out there. Either
way, not good.&quot;

&quot;So we need to perform an exorcism on whatever is
under those stones over there,&quot; Kitty said with
remarkable casualness.

&quot;Just like that?&quot; Alysande blinked.

&quot;No way,&quot; Illyanna blurted.

&quot;Seconded,&quot; Jean agreed, &quot;you have no idea what he
could do to you, especially with the potential power
that thing has.&quot;

&quot;Operative word being, potential,&quot; Kitty said as she
sipped her tea. She looked serious, &quot;The way I see it
we can take steps now, or wait however many years
until this blows up in our faces.&quot;

&quot;She does have a point,&quot; Allistaire offered.

&quot;Stay out of this,&quot; both Illyanna and Jean barked at
him.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Alysande protested.

&quot;We&#39;re they&#39;re guests, remember?&quot; Kitty pointed out.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Illyanna looked sheepish.

Rachel looked troubled, &quot;We faced that thing in the
future and it nearly killed us all.&quot; A deep breath, &quot;I
hate to say this, but I&#39;m with Kitty.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe this,&quot; Jean muttered.

Alysande sipped her tea and snuck the occasional
cookie as she watched the exchange unfold. The
situation quickly broke down into two camps: there was
Kitty and Rachel who were for taking steps to deal
with the threat and Jean and Illyanna who were both
dubious about the idea, primarily due to the dangers
involved. And of course Allistaire, who was following
the discussion eagerly and tossing in occasional
remarks.

&quot;Can I make an observation?&quot; Alysande finally spoke
up. When she was sure she had their attention she
continued, &quot;It seems like Illyanna and Jean would
agree to act, if the safety of the others could be
assured.&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Jean conceded while Illyanna nodded.

&quot;So is there a way to attempt the exorcism without
actually putting yourselves at risk?&quot; Alysande asked
them reasonably.

There was a moment of dead silence as they all grasped
that idea, then Jean shook her head, &quot;Why didn&#39;t I
think of that?&quot;

Illyanna drummed her fingers on the table, &quot;It could
be done, maybe.&quot; She looked over at Kitty, reaching
out to take her hand, &quot;Love?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d better get to work,&quot; Kitty agreed, taking her
hand with a warm smile.

&#39;Interesting, very interesting,&#39; Alysande thought as
she watched as the four women went to work, talking
together quietly.</pre>
