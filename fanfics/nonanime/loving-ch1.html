<pre>October 26, 2004:

They say it&#39;s never a dull moment
in Lawndale, however, for me, cheese 
fries, video game soundtracks, seeing
Sick Sad World and The Pizza King--
they&#39;re my only comfort zone for me,
lest life turns dullo for me. So why do 
I feel like one of these days that may all
change?  Just now, Jane&#39;s been joking 
with me that I may rediscover my love of
all things sexuality, and that I may
turn into a female Casanova. Come on--
who wants to turn into a modern day version
of a dead romantic sex lover?&quot;
--Daria Morgendorffer

&quot;What happenes when you cross a 
bunch of swimsuited babes with 
some katana swords? Bikini 
samurai babes, next on Sick Sad
World!!&quot;

Staring at the TV in her bedroom,
tuning into Sick Sad World, Daria
was into one of those living large
type of moods, and no wonder:
Jake was on a business trip, Helen was 
on a big time case and Quinn was out
on one of her dates with one of The 3
J&#39;s, so in effect, the cynic had the house
to herself. That is, until there was a knock 
at the front door.

&quot;Oh, for the love of peace,&quot; muttered the 
auburn, who turned off the TV and went down
the stairs to the front door; upon opening it,
Daria was greeted by a sweet faced Stacy, 
wearing her back pack.

&quot;Hey, Daria,&quot; the Fashion Clubber said sweetly.

For Daria, that was a bit unexpected. Since when
did one of Sandi&#39;s fashion drones greet the cynic
in such a friendly way? In any case, the auburn
said, &quot;If you wanna see Quinn, she&#39;s out on a date.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t come to see Quinn,&quot; said the braided brunette 
girl. &quot;I came to see you.&quot;

That was an unheard of thing indeed. Even so, what 
Stacy said sounded sincere, coming from such a kind
face, which the cynic thought was a rarity from a
member of Sandi The Griffin&#39;s Fashionistas, or
&quot;Sandinists&quot; as Jane called them. But the fact that
Stacy had come to see the auburn and not Quinn--
THAT was something Daria didn&#39;t expect.

Just then, Stacy broke into Daria&#39;s reverie with
&quot;Can I come in?&quot;

Sighing, Daria replied, &quot;Sure, why not?&quot;

&quot;OK,&quot; replied the braided brunetted girl. &quot;Let&#39;s 
go upstairs--I mean, if any of The Fashion Club
girls came here and saw me with you, we&#39;d be 
swamped with a LOT of questions--all that we 
don&#39;t want answered.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t doubt it,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;The last
thing I&#39;d want is a lynch mob. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

As soon as the two were upstairs and safe in 
Daria&#39;s bedroom, the auburn said, &quot;So why&#39;d
you come to see me, of all unfashionable people?&quot;

&quot;To thank you for making that Upchuck stop teasing 
me at the Lawndale High auditorium today,&quot; replied 
Stacy. &quot;I didn&#39;t think you could be so brave, much less
kind to someone like me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no big deal,&quot; said Daria. &quot;Not even someone so
shallow and fashionable deserves any of Upchuck&#39;s
run amok stick-a-needle-into-a-bimbo&#39;s-back-and
humiliate-the-hell-out-of-her dirty tricks.&quot;

&quot;No big deal?&quot; said the braided brunette. &quot;Daria,
that crummy insane-in-the-membrane Upchuck
was trying to offer me a chance to be his next
bikini model.......&quot; She broke off when she saw 
Daria rub the side of her left head temple.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; said Stacy. &quot;Your head hurt?&quot;

&quot;Must be one of those angst in my pants type of
headaches,&quot; said the cynic.

&quot;Why don&#39;t I rub that for you?&quot; said the FC girl.
&quot;To sort of ease your headache?&quot;

&quot;You?&quot; said the auburn. &quot;I don&#39;t know....&quot;

&quot;Please, Daria?&quot; said the braided brunette. &quot;You
helped me, so why don&#39;t I help you?&quot;

&quot;Sure, Stacy, sure,&quot; muttered Daria. &quot;Otherwise
you&#39;re likely to cry your eyes out all over the 
place.&quot;

&quot;Um, the thought HAD crossed my mind....oh,
skip it. &quot; Stacy came from behind the auburn
and started to massage the temples of the cynic&#39;s
head, gently kneading the trouble spots, easing
them, causing Daria to lay her head back and
sigh, enjoying the rapidly diminishing tension
and headaches.

&quot;Mmmmm....you like it? Feeling better....?&quot;
murmured Stacy, almost sounding seductive.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d say it,&quot; said the auburn, &quot; but.......
you&#39;re hitting the spots like a pro. How&#39;d you 
do that?&quot;

&quot;Simple,&quot; said the Fashion Clubber. &quot;I used to do 
that kind of stuff to Sandi and Quinn to ease their
tension; Tiffany&#39;s foster pop used to be in the
&#39;sage trade.&quot;

&quot;No wonder I feel......SO relaxed......,&quot; sighed 
Daria.

&quot;Then why don&#39;t you set yourself down here....?&quot;
suggested the braided brunette who now guided 
the cynic to her bed; Stacy then sat on the foot of the
bed, and Daria sat next to her. From there, the F.C. girl
massaged the temples and the scalp and facial muscles
of the auburn--

--and then, without warning, for some reason which
couldn&#39;t be explained, she leaned near and kissed Daria&#39;s
cheek, tenderly and gently, yet firmly.

At first, getting kissed by one of The Fashion Club, one
of Quinn&#39;s friends, and another girl, no less, took the cynic
by surprise......yet, for some reason, it felt so good....like
getting kissed by a rose, possibly due in part by Stacy&#39;s
sweet kissable silken mouth, combined with the cherry
lip gloss she used. And now, the sound of Stacy&#39;s entrancing
lulluby sounding voice, along with her gardenia perfume,
and most relaxing and enjoyable of all (besides that kiss),
was that massage, which now went down to her neck
and shoulders. 

And that wasn&#39;t all--the F.C. girl covered the auburn&#39;s
neck, face, forehead and cheeks with tender kisses,
sometimes moist, other times dry, not that anyone cared
that the cynic&#39;s face was now covered in lip prints from
the braided brunette&#39;s lip gloss. And though it all, Daria
was throughly passive and enjoying everything. Well, that,
along with Stacy now caressing the auburn&#39;s backside, 
down her sides, along the rest of her body, and her
stomach, gradually reaching below the breasts, till
she reached for the zipper and unzipped the cynic&#39;s
green coat before taking it off of her. 


As soon as the coat was off, the F.C, girl gradually 
caressed Daria&#39;s body till she was soon touching 
the auburn&#39;s breasts, lightly skimming them, till
the palms of each hand lightly brushed the tips 
of the nipples--and that was when the cynic threw 
her head back gasping, &quot;Aaaaaa....!!&quot; At the same 
moment, she felt wet down in her crotch.

&quot;What&#39;s that matter?&quot; said Stacy. &quot;Did I hurt you?&quot;

&quot;N-no....,&quot; said Daria. &quot;I-I am....sensitive there....
j-j-j-just....don&#39;t....st-st-st-stop....!!&quot;

Taking that auburn&#39;s reply as the green light,
Stacy fondled and kneaded the cynic&#39;s breasts, 
their nipples already hard and poking through
the fabric of the orange blouse, while Daria
moaned now and then. Suddenly, the F.C.
girl pulled off the auburn&#39;s blouse and in haste,
if not in passion, undressed the cynic, following
with her white wispy satin bra, her black skirt,
her white satin panty, her boots, and last of all,
her socks. From there, before Daria had a chance
to recover from the sexual trip she had been through,
Stacy took off her backpack, her coat, her blouse,
shoes and socks, trousers and her ice blue bra
and panty, then came behind the auburn, caressing
her nude body before caressing and rubbing the 
breasts--with the cynic&#39;s vagina already dripping fluids.

Resuming her kissing and caressing, the Fashion Clubber
was using her tongue on Daria&#39;s neck, ear, ear lobe and
breasts, occasionally singing, Loreena Mc Kennitt&#39;s
Dante&#39;s Prayer: &quot;Cast your eyes on the ocean/cast your
soul to the sea/when the dark night seems endless/please 
remember me.......&quot; At one point, Stacy used her fingertips,
then the tips of her fingernails to caress the auburn&#39;s 
body--THAT casued her to writhe in a surge of a sexual 
high. Just then (or so it seemed), the F. C. girl was thinking
and hearing an old tune sung by England Dan &amp; John
Ford Coley:

Many times, I wished you were here
through the velvet shadows of my dreams
Many times, I wished you were near
through the darkness as it came, but it seems
that you, you never said what I needed to hear


&quot;Sweetie girl....,&quot; murmured the braided brunette. &quot;I
want you so much....&quot;

As such, Daria allowed Stacy to lead her to her bed
and lay her down on it, on her back; the auburn
closed her eyes and writhed from time to time
while her vagina was real wet, and getting
wetter still, when it came to the F.C. girl 
caressing, licking and kissing the cynic&#39;s body, 
breasts and nipples. With all that sexual stimulation 
and loving, it was no wonder Daria moaned, &quot;Give
it to me.........I......love me....&quot;

And Stacy did just that--she stuck two of her fingers
in the auburn&#39;s vagina, using her thumb to caress the 
hard clit, whlie gently, then firmly licking and kissing 
the left nipple and breast, then the right nipple and
breast, then back to the left, the cynic groaning in
pleasure. All that went on for an hour....then Stacy
went--and kissed Daria full on the mouth, gently at
first, then with more intensity, gradually sticking
her tongue in for a french kiss; soon it was entwined
with the auburn&#39;s, while the girls held each other,
their bodies and breasts molded with each other, yet
the braided brunette fingered the cynic&#39;s vagina
and cilit till it was so wet. For Daria, the fact that Stacy
was a great kisser was evidenced in the kiss she and
the Fashion Clubber now shared....so beautiful, so
full of love and emotion.....so sweet......

Just tell me you love me
Whisper words I so long to hear
Let this time not be borrowed
Let it be ours to share
If you tell me you love me,
it will lead a way to your heart,
through the nearness of silence
You love me....

Finishing up the kiss, Stacy resumed the breast
stimulation on Daria before aiming her mouth and 
tongue on the auburn&#39;s vagina and clit, totally 
cleaning the cynic out with absloute abandon--
so it was no wonder Daria threw her head back,
a crying mew, like a jaguar kitten coming out of 
her mouth, syncopated with some breathy
gasps. And all that intensified when the F. C. girl
sucked and licked everything from the auburn&#39;s 
vagina, teasing the clit with a tongue, her mouth
for a suck and a kiss, and a gentle nibble with
her teeth. All of a sudden, the cynic came hard,
gushing her love fluids some of which covered 
Stacy&#39;s face, and some of which the braided 
brunette sucked up and drank, while the auburn
writhed a lot while gasping, &quot;Make me come.....!!&quot;

When she finally calmed down, Daria breathed,
&quot;Now it&#39;s my turn....&quot; After that, she turned Stacy 
over so that she was on her back; from there,
the auburn was on top of her, her body and breasts 
pressing so close and sensual against the F. C.
girl&#39;s, while they held each other, the cynic kissing
the braided burnette so passionately in the most
sexiest french kiss, the girls moaning in their
kiss while they clenched each other&#39;s hair. At 
one point, Stacy reached in her back pack 
that was alongside the bed with one hand, and 
produced a box of Godiva chocolates. Taking out
one of the candy pieces, she stuck it in her mouth
and she and Daria shared the candy piece with their
kiss.

Quietly, I&#39;ve waited
for the memory borne of our first kiss
Patiently, I&#39;ve waited
for the moment you would take me to a world,
that I&#39;ve, I&#39;ve never seen in that girl before

All of a sudden, the auburn went for the F. C.
girl&#39;s breast, clamping down on it in a hard
suck, her tongue licking the hard nipple 
inside, causing the braided brunette to 
writh and pitch her head back, gasping,
&quot;OH!! Oh, that is SO GOOD, Daria, suck it
so good and hard, lick that nipple, suck
that sweet breast of mine....!!&quot;

Indeed, Daria, did just that, orally loving
one breast and nipple, then the other,
then back to the first one, doing just as 
Stacy had done; needless to say, the 
F. C. girl was in a sexual high. When
the auburn stuck her index and center
finger in and out from within the braided
brunette&#39;s vagina, her thumb teasing the
clit, till they were wet, Stacy mewing in 
passion--until Daria&#39;s finger touched the
braided brunette&#39;s G spot.

&quot;Oh, YEA!!&quot; the F. C. girl moaned.&quot;Give me
EVERYTHING!! Please, make me come!!&quot;

No sooner did Daria hear that, she went
and orally cleaned out Stacy&#39;s vagina and
clit till it was so ripe with lots of sex fluids--
fluids that Daria gratefully drank while
Stacy screamed in her sexual pleasure,
till she came, her sighs intensifiying
in speed. But even after the F.C. girl
had finished coming, she and the cynic, 
not content with their recent passions, 
now got themselves into a 69 pose, and 
cleaned each other&#39;s vaginas out, licking,
sucking, kissing and tonguing each other,
and orally teasing each other&#39;s clit, moaning
while they did so.

Just tell me you love me
Whisper words I so long to hear
Let this time not be borrowed
Let it be ours to share
If you tell me you love me,
it will lead a way to your heart,
through the nearness of silence
You love me....
you love me....

After coming in each other&#39;s mouths--
and each girl gulping down their own
sex fluids as if they were nectar--Stacy,
who was on top of Daria, turned &#39;round
so she was facing her auburn lover, their
bodies pressing against each other, and
they kissed.

&quot;Oh, Daria,&quot; sighed the braided brunette,
&quot;I don&#39;t give a hang what Sandi and Tiffany
say, I love you so much....!!&quot;

&quot;What a way to thank someone,&quot; said the
cynic. &quot;I&#39;d hate to imagine how someone
like you would thank me if I saved you
from Cashman&#39;s in flames.&quot;

Licking her teeth with her tongue, the
F.C. girl said, &quot;I&#39;d....think of something.
Anyhow, thanks for everything, sweetie.&quot;

So saying, Stacy kissed Daria full on the 
mouth, said, &quot;Thank you,&quot; before getting
up, dressed, and after shouldering her
backpack, headed out the door, down the
stairs and out the front door, skipping
like a girl coming back from a county fair, 
while the auburn, having dressed, locked
the front door afterwards after the F. C.
girl&#39;s departure, grinning her Mona Lisa grin
over such an unusual day. &quot;I hope the Sick
Sad World staff is taking notes,&quot; she said.

The adventure was just beginning....

OWARI (THE END)
