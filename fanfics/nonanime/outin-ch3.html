<h1>Outside In (part 3 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/outin-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Kim tightened her fingers around what was closest, trying to discern 
what had happened by touching something.  It felt familiar, and when her 
fingers squeezed, someone else&#39;s fingers squeezed back on her wrist.

&quot;You awake, Kim?&quot;  The voice was also familiar, but Kim&#39;s head still 
throbbed with pain.

&quot;Shego?&quot; she mumbled.

&quot;I&#39;m right here, princess,&quot; Shego said in return.  &quot;How do you feel?&quot;

&quot;Terrible,&quot; Kim answered.  &quot;Where are we?  What happened to Tao?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s her name?&quot; Shego asked to no one.  &quot;I&#39;ve been asking her what 
her name is, but she wouldn&#39;t answer.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s mute,&quot; Kim murmured.  &quot;Where are we?&quot;

&quot;A forest,&quot; Shego answered.  &quot;We&#39;ve been walking for about three hours.  
You know, I hate seeing those glowing eyes pop out of nowhere, but she&#39;s 
the only person I can follow.  It got dark an hour ago.&quot;  Kim lifted her 
head from Shego&#39;s shoulder and looked about.  The ground was white with 
snow, and the bare trees seemed to glow with the moonlight.  Up ahead, 
Tao had stopped and turned about.  Her eyes glowed briefly when they 
caught the moonlight, but the shine faded after an instant.

&quot;You heard right,&quot; Shego muttered.  &quot;Our little Kimmie&#39;s awake now.  Do 
you think you can walk on your own now?&quot;  She stopped and carefully 
loosened her grip on Kim&#39;s arms and legs, letting the younger woman 
slide from her back.  Kim sighed, rubbing her eyes and forehead.

&quot;What on earth happened?&quot; she asked.  The memory rushed back to her 
abruptly and she gasped.  &quot;Shego!  Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Shego replied almost smugly.  &quot;When have you ever known me 
to be hurt?  Even you haven&#39;t been able to put a scratch on me, Kimmie.&quot;  
Kim ignored the jib and looked to Tao.

&quot;How did you do that?&quot; she asked.  &quot;You were standing next to me one 
moment and then you and Shego were gone.&quot;  Tao smiled rather sadly, her 
hands in her pockets.  The tail around her waist reached down and wrote 
something in the snow.  Kim walked a few somewhat shaky steps and 
crouched down to read what had been written.

There is a snake inside me, the words said.

&quot;How is that possible?&quot; Shego asked, having read over Kim&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Tao is the daughter of Ion Psymon, a biogenetic scientist,&quot; Kim 
answered, standing straight.  &quot;Tao was biogenetically engineered.  The 
genes she was spliced with must have be a mix of human and animal.  Tao, 
where have you been leading us?&quot;  Tao brushed the words away in the snow 
and wrote new ones.

My mother, the words said.  Without writing any further, she turned away 
and started to walk again.  Kim and Shego followed her, unsure of what 
else to do.  They walked for many more minutes until they came to the 
bottom of a hill.  Shego stopped, looking about with narrowed eyes.  She 
clenched her fists, green flames encircling her hands.

&quot;There&#39;s something out here with us,&quot; she murmured.  Instinctively, Kim 
drew closer to her while falling into her familiar fighting stance.  Tao 
looked over her shoulder at the two other women before looking around.  
She leaned back her head, took a deep breath, and let out an echoing 
wolf&#39;s howl.  Shego whirled to look at her in rage.

&quot;Are you insane?&quot; she demanded.  &quot;Why the hell did you do that?&quot;  Tao 
smiled slightly and put a finger to her lips.  Another howl echoed back 
through the cold night air.  The sound of crunching snow accompanied it 
only moments later, and without a moment&#39;s pause, a massive wolf slammed 
into Tao.  Shego and Kim jumped towards the two wrestling beings, but 
they stopped immediately when a strange sound reached their ears.  Tao 
was laughing.

She soon parted from the beast, sitting in the snow and laughing as she 
brushed the snow from her silver hair.  She pointed up the hill.  Kim 
and Shego turned and saw that a light now shone from a previously 
unnoticeable house.  A shadow was cast from the light and stretched down 
the hill.

&quot;I see you&#39;ve met my daughter,&quot; a voice called.  &quot;Come inside.  There&#39;s 
no sense in standing outside when the snow is about to start again.&quot;  
The shadow withdrew, and Kim and Shego, only sharing a confused look, 
followed it.  A house, hidden in the snow, stood at the top of the hill.  
The front door was open, waiting for Kim and Shego to enter.

&quot;Tao!&quot; Shego shouted, turning around once stepping inside.  &quot;Get up 
here!&quot;

&quot;She won&#39;t come inside,&quot; the voice from moments before said.  &quot;Not even 
when the snow starts again.  She&#39;ll just do what Lobo does and burrow 
under a snow pack to sleep.&quot;  A tall woman with short brown hair and 
black eyes stood before them.  Pince-nez rested on the bridge of her 
nose, and she wore long black clothing for the winter.

&quot;Why won&#39;t she come inside?&quot; Kim asked.  The woman, Ion Psymon, strode 
past them and closed the door.  She stood there for a time, her hand on 
the doorknob.

&quot;She won&#39;t tell me,&quot; she eventually said.  &quot;She hasn&#39;t spoken in sixteen 
years.&quot;  A silence crept up into the room and took over each woman&#39;s 
voice.  After many minutes, Ion turned around and leaned against the 
door, looking at Kim and Shego without a smile.  &quot;I assume you two are 
Kim Possible and Shego.  You&#39;re all over the news-along with Tao.  She&#39;s 
accused of kidnapping both of you.&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t,&quot; Kim insisted.  &quot;She just kept the police from shooting 
Shego.  If I hadn&#39;t gone with them...well, I had to go with them.&quot;  Ion 
gave her a slightly lingering look, but did not ask.

&quot;The storm is about to start,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;You two can stay here for 
the night.  Even if Tao carried you both back to Middleton, you wouldn&#39;t 
be able to get there before you suffered severe frostbite.&quot;  She started 
to turn away.

&quot;Hold it,&quot; Shego snapped.  Ion stopped and looked over her shoulder.

&quot;The guest room is that way,&quot; she said, pointing past Kim and Shego.  
Shego glared at her.

&quot;What is Tao?&quot; she demanded.  &quot;I worked with a mad scientist on a 
regular basis.  Human clones and gene splicing is insanely difficult.  
No one has found a completely stable method to do either one of them, 
let alone a combo of the two.  Just how did you make such a powerhouse 
that doesn&#39;t have the usual symptoms of clones or splices?&quot;

&quot;You speak of the susceptibility to the combination of chemicals in soda 
for clones and the insanity that all spliced creatures eventually suffer 
from,&quot; Ion sighed.  &quot;I took all these factors into consideration 
twenty-six years ago.  I worked for three years to try and discover the 
cause of the dissolving of the clones and the insanity for the spliced 
creatures.  It came to me when I looked at a gene-overlay.  There were 
inconsistencies in both, but as it was, if the methods were to be 
combined....&quot;

&quot;You could fix it?&quot; Kim gaped.  Ion closed her eyes with a faint smile 
of pride.

&quot;All but one consistently fatal missing piece in the genes,&quot; she 
continued.  &quot;It took me another year of testing to discover how to fix 
it.  There was no real base for the genes to keep hold of, figuratively, 
anyway.  The splice genes and clone genes both had an inherent weakness 
in their physical makeup.  The clones are not real humans because of the 
lack of human contact in their creation.  They need a mother, so I gave 
one of my ovum to create what I privately named Tao.&quot;

&quot;It was a success,&quot; Kim stated simply.

&quot;Since science before me has mapped the human genome, it was simple to 
take out what weaknesses existed in my genetic code, duplicate it as if 
there had been a father, and add in the animal genes that had been 
selected.  Muscular power of a black mamba, muscular endurance of a 
giant gray wolf, bite force of a great white, and the proportionate 
strength of a Hercules beetle to name a few.  Tao was &#39;born&#39; twenty-two 
years ago.&quot;  Ion heaved a sigh and walked out of the room, leaving Kim 
and Shego alone.

The wind sounded harder, rattling the windowpanes.  Shego&#39;s eyes flicked 
from the doorway that Ion had walked through to the front door a 
multitude of times.  After a few minutes, she sighed and put her arm 
around Kim&#39;s shoulder.  She turned the other young woman and led her 
down the hall into what Ion had called the guest room.  The room was 
somewhat small with plain white walls.  A bed, just large enough for two 
people, was tucked into a corner.

&quot;This is some serious weirdness,&quot; Shego muttered, sitting down on the 
bed.  &quot;So once we get back into Middleton, Tao&#39;s going to be public 
enemy number one, and I&#39;m down to number two.  Why did I ever hook up 
with you?  You&#39;re ruining my bad girl image.&quot;  Kim smiled and sat down 
next to her.

&quot;You should talk,&quot; she said.  &quot;I&#39;m supposed to throw you in jail.  At 
least you can claim good old seduction-to-get-at-me.  Heroes don&#39;t do 
that.&quot;

&quot;You should,&quot; Shego chuckled, wrapping her arms around Kim.  &quot;It&#39;s 
actually a lot of fun.&quot;  Kim smiled at her again and put one hand over 
Shego&#39;s.

&quot;I will eventually,&quot; she replied.  &quot;But not tonight.  We should both 
just get some sleep.&quot;

&quot;Spoilsport,&quot; Shego grumbled.  She flashed Kim a smirk, however, and 
pulled the other young woman under the blanket with her, holding her 
close as they both fell asleep quickly.

----------

Kim sighed as Tao leapt away, jumping into the trees to avoid stepping 
in the new snow.  She had carried Shego and Kim through the trees, not 
explaining why she did so.  Shego dusted herself off, adjusting the 
collar of her leather jacket.  She looked at Kim, spotting the strange 
gaze on the other young woman&#39;s face.

&quot;What?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I feel like it&#39;s my fault that Tao can never come back into Middleton,&quot; 
Kim sighed in return.  Shego sighed in exasperation, putting her hands 
behind her head to stretch.

&quot;If it makes you feel better, you kind of are,&quot; she muttered.  When Kim 
looked to her in shock, she continued.  &quot;You were the one who had to go 
and help her at the police station, from what you told me this morning.  
I&#39;m pretty sure she could have gotten out by herself.  But I&#39;m part of 
it too.  If she hadn&#39;t jumped between me and the cops, she wouldn&#39;t be 
charged with kidnapping.  And of course, it&#39;s Drakken&#39;s fault because he 
blew up your house, and she had to save you.&quot;

&quot;Are you saying she shouldn&#39;t have done all of that?&quot; Kim demanded.

&quot;No,&quot; Shego answered.  &quot;I&#39;m saying she&#39;s too good.  Look at her.  She 
should hate everything around her.  Why is she trying so hard to be a 
good person?&quot;

&quot;Not everyone is as dark-hearted as you think they are,&quot; Kim said 
tersely.

&quot;That&#39;s not it,&quot; Shego said in turn.  &quot;Kim, think about everyone in that 
police station.  The people who saw her, they don&#39;t want her alive-hell, 
they don&#39;t want her to exist.  Have you ever thought about that?  Even 
you would be mad at the world if no one wanted you to exist.&quot;  There was 
a heavy silence.  Shego sighed and kissed Kim on the cheek.  &quot;Listen, 
you should get back to wherever your family is right now and make sure 
they know you&#39;re all right.  You know, why don&#39;t you tell the police the 
truth about Tao?&quot;

&quot;They won&#39;t believe me,&quot; Kim murmured rather forlornly.  Shego smiled 
slightly and kissed her on the lips.

&quot;If you need me, my cell phone is always on,&quot; she said.  &quot;Make sure to 
stay safe, all right?  Avoid missions for a while.&quot;  Kim managed to 
crack a minor smile and nodded.  Shego patted her on the head and 
turned, walking away.  Kim turned as well, walking slowly towards the 
place where her family&#39;s house had been.

The walk felt longer than she remembered, even though she had never 
walked from the edge of the city before.  She couldn&#39;t comprehend what 
Shego had said.  She did not understand how humanity could hate itself, 
even in such a varied form in Tao.  She did not yet have the capacity 
for such hatred, which might have been why the world called her a hero.

&quot;Kim!&quot;  Kim looked up at the shout, stopping dead in her tracks.  The 
frame for a house-a house just like the one that had burned down-was 
already raised on the freshly cleared patch of land.  Construction 
workers milled about, the sound of hammers loud in the cold air.  A 
weight hit her around the middle and nearly knocked her over.  Jim and 
Tim both had launched themselves at her and hugged her fiercely.

&quot;Kim, look!&quot; Jim cried joyously.  &quot;These guys heard what happened, and 
their boss said he owed you a favor!  They&#39;re making us a new house!&quot;  
Kim, still shocked, looked at the workers and the job they had done so 
far.

&quot;That&#39;s great,&quot; she murmured in a stunned voice.  However, what snapped 
her from her reverie was a faint rumbling in the ground.  She looked up 
and saw, as if it were purposefully moving at a painfully slow rate, a 
giant robot stomping around a corner.  One glaring, glowing red 
sphere-an eye-swiveled to stare at Kim from the black metal face of the 
machine.

&quot;Ah, Kim Possible,&quot; a voice echoed metallically from the robot.  &quot;Just 
who I was looking for.  Now where have you hidden Tao?&quot;  Kim jerked in 
shock.  She took a nervous step backwards, reaching into her pocket for 
any kind of gadget.  When her hand found only a few hunks of lint, she 
remembered that she had left all of her things in her room.  Everything 
had been destroyed in the explosion.

&quot;What do you want with Tao?&quot; Kim shouted back to the robot.  A chuckle 
rattled inside the metal plates, sending a cold jolt down Kim&#39;s back.

&quot;I&#39;m going to kill her,&quot; the voice laughed.  &quot;Now where is she?&quot;  Kim 
pushed her brothers away, putting her hands up as she fell, once more, 
into her comfortable stance.  The robot&#39;s arm reared back, the three 
large, flat prongs opening wide to create the most space to crush Kim.  
Kim flipped backwards, and the closest prong slammed into the ground 
inches away from her feet when she landed.  She sprang forwards, running 
up the robot&#39;s arm.  A few feet before the arm met its shoulder, Kim 
leapt up and forward, both feet extended.

Her kick landed in the center of the red glowing eye, but did damage to 
Kim.  Her legs bent against her will, her joints quivering for a moment 
before she began to fall away from the robot.  The heroine twisted in 
midair, landing on her hands and flipping back.  When she put her feet 
to the ground, her ankles would not support her weight.  Kim stumbled 
and fell to the ground, looking up at the robot in fright.

&quot;Poor little cheerleader,&quot; the voice snickered.  &quot;If you won&#39;t tell me 
where Tao is, then I guess I&#39;ll just have to kill you.&quot;  The robot&#39;s arm 
rose up to strike.  Kim was unable to close her eyes.  She watched as 
the arm began to fall at a blurring rate, but noticed a second blur 
appear before her.  An echoing clang caused enough pain in Kim&#39;s ears to 
make her close her eyes.  When she opened her eyes again, she gasped.

&quot;Tao, how are you...?&quot; she questioned.  Tao stood before her, hands 
holding the robot arm from striking Kim.  Without pause, she threw the 
arm to the side into the ground.  The robot lifted its arm from the 
cracked cement, the glacial laugh resonating from within its shell.

&quot;There you are, monster,&quot; the voice snarled.  &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you.&quot;  
All the tension that was so obvious in Tao&#39;s body vanished at the voice.  
&quot;Oh, so the monster has a memory?  You should remember me.  Now be a 
good beast and die.&quot;  The prongs on the robot&#39;s arm opened again, a 
massive spike emerging from the center of the arm.  When the robot 
struck, it appeared as though Tao did not move and was slammed into the 
ground.  After the dust cleared, Tao was standing on the robot&#39;s arm, 
clutching her own bleeding arm.

An arc of blue-white electricity crackled through the air around Tao.  
It swirled around her body, jumping almost instantly to the metal of the 
robot.  Tao smirked, the hair on her head and the fur on her tail rising 
up as the sound of raw electricity filled the air.  A sheer blast of the 
electric energy flowed out of Tao and into the robot.  She leapt away as 
the robot quaked, landing next to Kim just as the robot crashed to the 
ground in a heap.  Before Kim realized what else had happened, Tao had a 
bloody hand on her wrist and someone else was holding a knife to her 
throat.  She willed herself not to gasp when a gun was pointed at Tao.

&quot;Unless you let her go, I&#39;ll shoot you and slice her throat,&quot; a young 
woman&#39;s voice snapped.  &quot;Step back now!&quot;  Tao slowly let go of Kim&#39;s 
hand, stepping back a few feet.  &quot;Dumb animal.&quot;  The gun was fired, but 
Tao stepped slightly to the side.  The bullet grazed her face, scorching 
open the skin.  She stared at the woman behind Kim, her eyes still wide 
in shock.  The young woman shot another bullet and Tao dodged, but she 
jerked forwards.

&quot;Tao!&quot; Kim shouted in shock.  Tao stumbled and fell to the ground, 
unconscious, two tranquilizer darts in her back.  &quot;Tao!&quot;
