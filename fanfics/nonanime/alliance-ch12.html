Renee Montoya paused as she opened the door to her office, then closed 
the door as the brown haired woman said, &quot;You didn&#39;t have to sneak in 
here.&quot;

The heroine called Spoiler leaned up against the wall, her black 
bodysuit absorbing the light. Over top that she wore purple gloves and 
swashbuckler boots along with a purple cloak. The final touch was a 
golden utility belt, in her case worn over the shoulder and across her 
front.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Spoiler&#39;s voice was muffled enough to be unrecognizable, &quot;but I 
didn&#39;t think the front door was a option.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Renee agreed as she walked to her desk and unlocked the top 
drawer. She drew the papers out, &quot;Here&#39;s the report you asked for, all 
the data I could find on the League of Assassins and their activities 
over the last year.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Spoiler gave her a envelope full of money that she drew 
from beneath her cloak. As she began to skim through the papers she 
mused, &quot;Any trends leap out at you?&quot;

&quot;One thing,&quot; Renee said as she leaned against the side of her desk, 
&quot;their targets have shifted a bit lately.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Spoiler looked curiosity.

&quot;They&#39;ve only been hitting underworld figures,&quot; Renee said dryly, &quot;I 
can&#39;t say with complete certainty but it looks like they&#39;ve shifted how 
they&#39;re doing business.&quot;

&quot;Or their boss has caused them to shift,&quot; Spoiler mused.

Renee nodded, &quot;That&#39;s possible too.&quot;

Spoiler tucked the papers away in a pouch in her cloak as she walked to 
the window and said, &quot;If you learn anything new, contact me the usual 
way.&quot;

&quot;Use masking tape to make a purple x in the window?&quot; Renee teased 
slightly.

Spoiler chuckled faintly, &quot;How about just my cellphone?&quot;

Renee chuckled softly as Spoiler swung out into the Gotham night, soon 
completely disappearing into the shadows. Her own expression became more 
serious as she sat back, silently considering what she had learned.

&#39;That kid isn&#39;t ready to take on the League,&#39; Renee thought to herself 
frimly as she sat casually at her desk, wishing she had the Gotham 
police to ask for help. &#39;Or at least a way to get a hold of the Batman.&#39;

The phone rang and Renee reached for it, &quot;Yes?&quot;

Kate Kane&#39;s voice was warm as the other woman said, &quot;Love, you sound 
exhausted.&quot;

Renee smiled, imagining her redheaded lover in the penthouse she lived 
in, in addition to using as her base as Batwoman. &quot;I just got finished 
meeting with Spoiler,&quot; she said, &quot;you were right, it does look like 
she&#39;s going after the League of Assassins.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s... not good at all,&quot; Kate said after a moment. &quot;Do you think we 
should try to stop her?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I doubt we could,&quot; Renee said, &quot;short of brute force. And to be honest 
that is not a route I want to go down.&quot;

&quot;Reminds me a bit too much of the Bat,&quot; Kate agreed. &quot;How about we tail 
her and offer our help if needed?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Renee said firmly. She smiled, &quot;Do we call out our 
buddies?&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Kate made a thoughtful sound, &quot;we&#39;ll probably need Oracle&#39;s help 
to track her. Do the Birds still owe you a favor?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I helped them deal with a Intergang cell,&quot; Renee remembered, &quot;I 
think they&#39;d help out, especially if what I heard about Oracle and 
Batgirl is true.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Kate asked.

&quot;According to my source, Oracle was Batgirl&#39;s mentor for awhile,&quot; Renee 
revealed. &quot;Wonder how Oracle feels knowing Batgirl now leads the League 
of Assassins?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t ask,&quot; Kate said dryly.

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Renee chuckled, deciding her curiosity would have to 
remain unsatisfied. &quot;All right, I&#39;ll call her,&quot; she said, &quot;catch you 
later.&quot;

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Kate said, &quot;I&#39;ll be out patrolling, meet you when I get 
back.&quot;

&quot;Take care,&quot; Renee said as she signed off.

Renee got up from her desk and closed the window, drawing the blinds 
down to seal off the room. From her belt buckel she drew a sphere of 
puddy like material even as she pressed a switch, releasing a strange 
gas that changed the color of her clothes and hair. As the gas spread 
she pressed the puddy to her face, spreading it to erase her features 
and become the Question.

The communication device Oracle gave her worked like a charm, and soon 
Question is connected to their network. Huntress replied first, &quot;What do 
you want, Question?&quot;

&#39;That&#39;s friendly,&#39; the Question thought, hiding a smile. &quot;To save a 
life, hopefully,&quot; she answered coolly.

&quot;Huh,&quot; Huntress hesitated then sighed, &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s been a long day and 
looks to be a even longer night.&quot;

&quot;I know how that feels,&quot; Question agreed.

&quot;So,&quot; Huntress said briskly, &quot;how can we help?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re familiar with Spoiler?&quot; Question asked.

Huntress seemed surprised, &quot;Yes, we worked together before she faked her 
death.&quot;

Question leaned against her desk as she revealed the research Spoiler 
had been doing as well as her connection to Batgirl. &quot;I think she&#39;s 
planing on going after the league of Assassins,&quot; she concluded.

&quot;She&#39;s good,&quot; Huntress said after a moment&#39;s thought, &quot;but not that 
good. What do you want us to do?&quot;

&quot;I understand Oracle has access to satellites,&quot; Question said, &quot;is it 
possible she can monitor the city and let me know when Spoiler moves? 
That&#39;ll give me a chance to get some back up together for her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll ask Oracle, but I don&#39;t see why not,&quot; Huntress said.

There was a crackle and a third voice cut in, &quot;This is Oracle. If it&#39;s 
to help Spoiler, I&#39;m willing to do it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Question smiled, feeling a surge of relief.

&quot;Question,&quot; Oracle continued on, &quot;have you considered my offer to become 
one of my regular agents?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m willing to help as needed,&quot; Question answered them tactfully, &quot;but 
I really don&#39;t consider myself a joiner.&quot;

There was wry amusement in Oracle&#39;s voice as she replied, &quot;Fair enough.&quot; 
In a brisker tone she continued, &quot;I&#39;ll start scanning Gotham now, and if 
I spot Spoiler on the move I&#39;ll use this signal device to let you know.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Question answered.

&quot;By the way,&quot; Huntress jumped in when Oracle signed off, &quot;I&#39;d like to 
help when you go after the League.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll call you when we move out,&quot; Question promised before hanging up.

Stealthily the Question climbed out the window onto a fire escape, 
standing there as she looked out at the alleys of Gotham city. Drawing 
her trench coat around her the Question descended the stairs and walked 
out into the night, waiting to see what it would bring.

Like every night in Gotham there was trouble, you just needed to know 
where to look for it. A mugging in crime alley was dealt with quickly, 
the victims sent on their way out of the dangerous zone. From the bad 
side of town the Question fought to the good side, stopping a attempted 
museum heist as a group of high tech crooks ran for safety.

&quot;Ah ah!&quot; a figure swung down to strike a fleeing man, &quot;Bad crook.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Batwoman,&quot; Question smiled as she rounded up the last two men 
and bound their hands with police style cuffs.

&quot;Well, a Falcone,&quot; Batwoman noted as she hauld him over, &quot;I thought 
Holiday had gotten them all.&quot;

&quot;Al Falcone,&quot; Question recognized the small, weasel-like man, &quot;you cam 
from Sicily to revive the family fortunes?&quot;

&quot;Damn freaks,&quot; the brown haired man muttered, &quot;before they came along 
the Falcone name meant something.&quot;

&quot;It still means something,&quot; Batwoman said as they tied him up too, &quot;it&#39;s 
mud, now.&quot;

The police arrived and both of them ducked into the shadows, watching as 
they were arrested. &quot;Harvey,&quot; Question murmured as her old partner 
Bullock hauled one of the men up, hustling him towards a squad car.

&quot;Do you miss being a cop?&quot; Batwoman asked quietly.

&quot;I miss the people,&quot; Question admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t miss the dirty cops, 
the political pressures and all the rest of the crap.&quot;

Batwoman reached out to gently squeeze her shoulder, and they each 
exchanged a tired smile. &quot;I think we can call it a night,&quot; she said 
softly.

&quot;Let&#39;s,&quot; Question agreed as they walked off together.
