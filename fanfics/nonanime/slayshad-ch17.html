<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Tara sighed softly as she felt herself slowly come
awake, laying there on the bed in her rooms not far
from the Bronze. The brown haired young woman opened
her eyes, blinking tiredly, then she smiled happily as
she saw who lay beside her.

Faith looked much gentler, somehow, when she was fast
asleep, the normally battle capable vampire slayer
defenseless as she slept. Many scars marked her slim,
muscled body, but as Tara had quickly learned last
night they hadn&#39;t touched on the warrior&#39;s soul, Faith
treating her with such gentleness and caring.

A blush colored her cheeks as Tara remembered how they
had left the Bronze together, conversing softly as
Faith walked her home. Inviting Faith up had seemed
the right thing to do, and talk and gently led them
into going to bed together. Faith had been a warm and
compassionate lover, going as slow as Tara needed her
to, then helping her in satisfying her own hungers.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Faith murmured, smiling at Tara
gently.

&quot;It is, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Tara softly agreed, feeling a flash
of pleasure at the warmly contented look on Faith&#39;s
face. She reached out to gently push the slightly
messy hair back and Faith purred, tilting her head to
maximize that touch.

Faith cupped Tara&#39;s hand then kissed it gently. &quot;I
don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ll be able to stay in
Sunnydale,&quot; she admitted softly, &quot;but this isn&#39;t
casual for me, Tara.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Tara admitted. She smiled wryly, &quot;And I
have obligations to the coven to fulfill...&quot;

Faith chuckled. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll take it one day at a
time,&quot; she offered.

Tara took one of Faith&#39;s hands and squeezed it gently,
&quot;Fair enough.&quot;

Reluctantly Faith sat up, still keeping a gentle grip
on Tara&#39;s hand. &quot;As much as I&#39;d like to stay laying
here,&quot; she sighed, &quot;I&#39;d better check in with Giles.&quot;

&quot;I think that Jenny would have told him what we were
doing,&quot; Tara pointed out gently.

Faith chuckled softly, &quot;Yeah, but I don&#39;t want his
uptight British underwear to get into too tight of a
knot.&quot;

&quot;Here,&quot; a clearly amused Tara handed Faith the bedside
phone.

Faith dialed the number by memory and smiled as the
phone was picked up on the first ring. &quot;Hey G-man,
how&#39;s it hanging?&quot; Her face quickly lost all amusement
as she listened, &quot;Yes, right. I&#39;ll meet you there.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Tara asked worriedly.

&quot;Vampire attack last night,&quot; Faith said grimly as she
grabbed at her clothes and began to dress, &quot;and it
looks like they murdered the mayor.&quot;

&quot;Goddess,&quot; Tara breathed out, her face grave. With a
grim look she began to dress too, &quot;I&#39;d better tag
along, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Always glad for the help,&quot; Faith admitted, &quot;but why
this one?&quot;

&quot;Because the mayor was also a major occultist,&quot; was
Tara&#39;s grim reply.

Meanwhile, Rupert Giles and several allies were
already cautiously looking around the office where the
Mayor&#39;s bloodless corpse had been found that morning.
&quot;So how did we get in here again?&quot; Buffy asked, the
sandy blonde haired woman looking with some distaste
at a odd statue.

&quot;I developed some pull with the police when the Master
was running rampant,&quot; Giles noted, pushing his glasses
up as he carefully studied a book. &quot;Don&#39;t touch that,
by the way, it probably has a curse protecting it.&quot;

&quot;Ick,&quot; Buffy quickly pulled her hand away.

Willow gave him a look, &quot;This whole place has a creepy
aura around it, watcher.&quot;

&quot;Very perceptive,&quot; Jenny Calendar said wryly, the
witch and former computer teacher cautiously sorting
through a case containing mystical artifacts. &quot;It
appears he was more than involved with the occult,&quot;
she continued, &quot;he was working black sorcery.&quot;

&quot;As in?&quot; Buffy asked cautiously.

&quot;Looking through the scattered documents,&quot; Giles gazed
about at the wreckage in the room, including artifacts
and rare books, &quot;he was studying demons and demonic
ascension.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Buffy blinked, &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Becoming a unstoppable, full blooded demon,&quot; Giles
said dryly.

&quot;We were lucky, though,&quot; Jenny noted, &quot;it seems he had
the chance to do it several years ago but was
prevented by the Master. He&#39;s been biding his time
ever since, waiting for another chance.&quot;

&quot;But why would the Master stop him?&quot; Buffy looked
curious, &quot;I mean, wouldn&#39;t they both be on the same
side?&quot;

&quot;I suspect the Master wouldn&#39;t want someone around
with more power than he had,&quot; Willow said grimly. She
looked towards Giles, &quot;Any idea what the vamps who
killed him took?&quot;

&quot;Several scrolls of prophecy appear to be missing from
the inventory he maintained of his collection,&quot; Giles
said grimly.

&quot;Prophecies about?&quot; Jenny asked.

&quot;The apocalypse, it seems,&quot; Giles pushed up his
glasses reflexedly.

&quot;No, that doesn&#39;t sound too good,&quot; Faith said as she
led the way inside the office, Tara following close
behind her.

Tara flinched as she crossed the threshold,
shuddering. &quot;What did he have in here?&quot; she gasped
out, face pale.

&quot;What?&quot; Faith reached out to steady her, eyes wide
with concern.

&quot;There&#39;s such a strong aura of evil about this place,&quot;
Tara visibly shuddered as she confessed, &quot;it makes my
skin crawl.&quot;

Jenny looked at Tara with gentle concern, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,
I forgot how much more sensitive you are to things
like this.&quot;

&quot;A little beyond getting the ordinary willies?&quot; Buffy
asked softly.

Willow nodded her agreement, &quot;A sensitive can get a
impression of what has happened in a place, especially
if great good or evil has happened there.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised you know that,&quot; Buffy said quietly.

&quot;I studied the craft a bit before...&quot; Willow trailed
off, the vampire shrugging slightly.

&#39;Before she became a vampire,&#39; Tara thought but didn&#39;t
say anything. To Jenny she offered a reassuring smile,
&quot;I&#39;ll be all right, just give me a moment.&quot;

Faith was reluctant, but Tara was clearly determined
to manage on her own. Giving the other woman her space
she looked at Giles, &quot;So they have these prophecies
about the apocalypse... they wouldn&#39;t happen to be
instruction books on how to cause one?&quot;

&quot;In the wrong hands,&quot; Giles conceded, &quot;yes.&quot;

&quot;Great,&quot; Buffy looked disgusted, &quot;but why would the
master of these vamps want to destroy the world?&quot;

&quot;Some vampires are nihilists,&quot; Giles shrugged tiredly,
&quot;destroying the world might seem to them like a great
idea.&quot;

&quot;And who says that the apocalypse would destroy the
world?&quot; Tara offered. She smiled grimly, &quot;It might
just destroy most of human civilization.&quot;

&quot;An&#39; the vamps would have a field day,&quot; Faith
realized.

Jenny nodded grimly, &quot;Which means we need to recover
the prophecies as soon as possible.&quot; She pulled her
jacket around her as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll gather the coven,
try to determine who is leading the vampires
magically.&quot;

Buffy looked towards Willow, Faith and Tara, &quot;I guess
we&#39;ll be increasing the patrols.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ll hit the books,&quot; Giles said grimly, &quot;try to
find other copies of the prophecies so we can try to
head them off somehow.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just hope that&#39;s enough,&quot; Willow murmured.</pre>
