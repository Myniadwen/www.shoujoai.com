A god. He was a god. I&#39;d been helping him all along. I&#39;d been helping a 
god. I was back in the big room. They were all staring. He came out of 
the shiny old me. She fell just like me. She fell and he spread out his 
wings.

Dark red. And black. His wings were huge. Hovering over the shiny old 
me. His horns. All of him. It reeked. He was the god from all the 
pictures. He&#39;d kill us all. He had already slaughtered the girl. I knew 
it was him. It had to be.

The man ran. He wasn&#39;t a fighter. And he didn&#39;t want to die. I didn&#39;t 
care. I envied the woman as the god killed her. She smiled. Smiled as 
she dropped dead. Killed by lightning.

Left were only the girl&#39;s dad and the god. And a wheelchair. Something 
strange about it. Didn&#39;t want to remember.

They fought. The girl&#39;s dad didn&#39;t run away. He shot the god. The god 
shot the girl&#39;s dad. Lightning and bullets. Endless fighting.

Someone. Something. Inside the girl&#39;s dad. Helping. Something took all 
the hits. The god didn&#39;t hurt him. Not for real. Tiresome. Sleepy.

Darkness. And silence. I woke up again when it screamed. Freezing 
scream. Deafening. Then it fell. The god fell. Died. The girl&#39;s dad 
killed the god.

Relief. The god. It had cheated all along. And now it was dead. It was 
gone.

The girl&#39;s dad. He ran to the fallen old me. Couldn&#39;t hear what they 
said. Everything faded slowly. Everything ended. The shiny old me held 
out her arms. Gave him something. I wanted. I had to see what it was.

Lacking strength. Dying. Couldn&#39;t get up. Couldn&#39;t move. The girl&#39;s dad 
took it in his arms. Held it tightly. To his heart. A child?

The shiny old me. She pointed. It rained fire. She pointed, it rained, 
and he ran. Ran away with the child. The man was there too. But he 
couldn&#39;t run.

The nurse. The one the girl drew. She took the man. Dragged him away. 
Only the girl&#39;s dad and the child escaped. Now we were truly alone. She 
stopped shining. Slowly. Faded away.

I was lying on my back. Cold. It was cold. Really much. The stars above 
went out one by one. I reached out for them. For the heavens. For the 
people above me. For life. Happiness. Anything I could reach. I&#39;d take 
anything.

There was nothing. My hand returned empty. No hope. And no fear. 
Everything had slowed down. Slug speed. Waiting. I had reached nothing. 
A little bit of happiness. The girl.

Somehow I could still feel. Feel tears run down my face. Wetting 
everything. I was supposed to watch her. Take care of her. Be her 
mother. No. Sister. Friend. It didn&#39;t work.

I was hoping. Maybe. Maybe I&#39;d see her again. Waiting for the kiss. The 
sweet kiss of death. Memories flashed by. I&#39;d rather they&#39;d leave me 
alone.

Not all of it was sad. But nothing was happy. My sister. We played 
together. But when I was alone I always drew the same things. The dogs. 
The dinosaurs with wings. Adults. Worse things.

In school. Blank. I only remembered the girl&#39;s toilet. Crying. All the 
time. The others hated me. They had knives. Wrote things on my table.

Lighthouse. So short. Standing at the edge. Couldn&#39;t jump. Couldn&#39;t let 
go.

The hallway in the house. The stairs. My room. Butterflies. Dinosaurs. 
Books. Drawings everywhere.

The house. Tied up. They&#39;re walking around me. Heat. Flames. I scream. 
My clothes. On fire. I&#39;m burning.

Below it all. They wrapped me up. Never spoke to me. Left me alone. 
Watching. They hated me. Everyone did. And they wouldn&#39;t let me die. I 
couldn&#39;t die.

A road. Night. Chilling breeze. Protective uniform. A car&#39;s coming. It&#39;s 
evading. Falling off the road.

I reached out again, but there was nothing. There never was.
