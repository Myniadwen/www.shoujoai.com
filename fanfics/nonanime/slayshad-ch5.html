<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        Buffy met the dark haired woman in the eye, and knew that she 
was telling her the truth. Whatever else Faith might be, she was a 
vampire Slayer. &quot;Would you care for a drink?&quot; she asked, gesturing her 
towards a seat by the bar.

        &quot;Wouldn&#39;t mind,&quot; Faith smiled as she sat down.

        &quot;Ah, well,&quot; Giles blinked in surprise, then the Englishman 
shrugged slightly. &quot;Why not,&quot; he sat down as well.

        &quot;What can I get for you?&quot; Tara asked coolly. The brown haired 
wiccan bartender seemed a bit on edge, looking at the two of them 
warily.

        &quot;Whiskey with ice,&quot; Giles surprised them slightly by ordering.

        &quot;Rum and coke,&quot; Faith smiled wryly.

        Buffy waited until Tara served the drinks before the slim 
blonde asked, &quot;So why am I being graced with a meeting by a rep. of 
the Watchers Council and another Slayer?&quot;

        &quot;The Watchers Council is very concerned by your recent 
behavior,&quot; Giles said a bit uncomfortably.

        &quot;Why?&quot; Buffy said pointedly, &quot;I&#39;m slaying more vampires now 
than ever before.&quot;

        Faith smiled wryly, &quot;They figure you&#39;ve gone over to the dark 
side because you teamed up with that vampire.&quot;

        &quot;Then if you have a problem with me,&quot; the woman emerged from 
the shadows, &quot;you should take it up with me.&quot; Willow smiled slightly, 
her reddish brown hair flowing around her pale face, a paleness 
intensified by the black leather overcoat she wore.

        &quot;Back, spawn of darkness,&quot; Giles held up a cross.

        Willow seemed completely unfazed, &quot;I used to be Jewish.&quot; She 
looked over at Buffy to gently ask, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

        &quot;Better now that you&#39;re here,&quot; Buffy smiled.

        Willow moved forward to take a seat at the bar, nodding to 
Tara. Keeping a careful eye on Faith she asked Giles, &quot;So?&quot;

        Giles still seemed a bit stunned that the cross didn&#39;t work. 
&quot;How did...&quot; he asked weakly.

        &quot;I suppose it&#39;s a matter of belief,&quot; Willow took a seat beside 
Buffy. &quot;I was never a Christian, so the symbols of it don&#39;t bother 
me.&quot;

        Giles nodded thoughtfully, about to open his mouth to ask 
another question when he suddenly remembered why he was there. 
&quot;Right,&quot; he reached up to push his glasses into place, &quot;the Waters&#39; 
Council is growing concerned over your interaction with our Slayer.&quot;

        &quot;Our?&quot; Willow gave him a dangerous glare as she growled out, 
&quot;I do not recall Buffy ever being your property!&quot;

        Giles winced under her glare, as well as seeing the displeased 
expressions on both Buffy and Faith&#39;s faces. &quot;Oh, for a better choice 
of words,&quot; he sighed.

        &quot;Way to go, G.&quot; Faith muttered to Giles. She turned to look at 
Willow and said, &quot;Look, I have no problem with you being a vampire, I 
worked with Angel up in LA.&quot;

        &quot;But?&quot; Willow asked, knowing there was more coming.

        &quot;You have one hell of a reputation,&quot; Faith said bluntly, &quot;one 
of the worst vamps of a generation. The Council&#39;s got reason to be 
worried.&quot;

        &quot;She&#39;s not like that any more,&quot; Buffy scowled.

        &quot;That has yet to be determined,&quot; Giles said dryly.

        &quot;And how do you plan to test her?&quot; Tara spoke up, surprising 
them. She shot a glare at Giles, &quot;The same trials the Council used on 
witches in times past?&quot;

        Giles winced, &quot;That was a different time, madam, long ago.&quot;

        &quot;Not that long ago to me and my people,&quot; Tara crisply replied. 
She looked over with a frown at Willow, &quot;I have absolutely no reason 
to like this vampire, but I&#39;ll fight tooth and nail to prevent you 
from taking her.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Buffy agreed, all the while wondering what had gone 
on between Tara and Willow. &#39;Tara certainly doesn&#39;t like her much,&#39; 
she mused.

        Faith had an odd smile on her face as she watched Willow, 
&quot;Most vamps would have started a fight rather than be in the middle of 
this sort of discussion.&quot;

        &quot;Tempting, but no,&quot; Willow answered her quietly as the debate 
raged on beside them. She looked at Faith, trying to read her as she 
asked, &quot;Disappointed?&quot;

        &quot;A bit. I enjoy the Slaying, mostly,&quot; Faith shrugged.

        &quot;I don&#39;t,&quot; Willow admitted, &quot;the taking of a life, even one 
twisted by a demon&#39;s presence, is always something to regret.&quot;

        Faith nodded to herself thoughtfully, then she turned back to 
the three-way fight going on and loudly yelled, &quot;HEY!&quot;

        All three turned to look over at her in surprise. &quot;I beg your 
pardon?&quot; Giles asked.

        Faith nodded to Giles, &quot;You don&#39;t trust that Willow&#39;s 
reformation is genuine.&quot; She looked over at Buffy, &quot;And you don&#39;t 
trust the Watchers&#39; Council to treat Willow fairly.&quot; She paused to ask 
the two of them, &quot;Am I right?&quot;

        Both Giles and Buffy nodded, while Tara glared suspiciously. 
Faith continued, &quot;So let&#39;s try a compromise. I&#39;ll stick around here 
with Giles, keep an eye on you two. If Willow reverts, we&#39;ll be here 
to help, and Willow gets a chance to prove she&#39;s a good girl.&quot;

        Buffy was about to open up her mouth to argue when Willow put 
her hand on her partner&#39;s arm. &quot;It&#39;s not a bad plan,&quot; she offered.

        &quot;And I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on you two,&quot; Tara gave Giles a 
look that made him go bone pale, &quot;if you try to pull anything 
underhanded, I&#39;ll have to take steps.&quot; With that, she strode off to 
serve the other customers.

        &quot;She really doesn&#39;t like you,&quot; Buffy looked at Giles 
curiously, &quot;why?&quot;

        &quot;What she mentioned was mostly accurate,&quot; Giles said, &quot;in 
times past the Watchers&#39; Council was overzealous in our pursuit of 
demons, and many followers of the craft paid the price.&quot;

        There was a long moment of silence, the group of four sitting 
there, finishing their drinks. &quot;Do you want to stay?&quot; Willow asked 
Buffy softly.

        &quot;It&#39;s been a long day,&quot; Buffy shrugged, &quot;to be honest, I&#39;d 
rather head home.&quot;

        Willow met both Giles and Faith&#39;s eyes steadily, &quot;Then I think 
we&#39;ll see you later.&quot; With that, both young women left the bar 
together.

        &quot;They make a cute couple, don&#39;t they?&quot; Faith mused once they 
were gone.

        Giles looked at her in shock, &quot;You don&#39;t think they&#39;re...?&quot;

        Faith wiggled her hand in the air, &quot;I dunno. That&#39;s the vibe I 
get from them, though.&quot;

        &quot;Oh dear,&quot; Giles groaned softly

        The city was quiet as Willow and Buffy walked together down 
the street. &quot;I thought that you were going to lunge at Giles when he 
said that &#39;our&#39; comment,&quot; Buffy laughed.

        Willow actually blushed a bit, &quot;What can I say, he pissed me 
off.&quot;

        &quot;He&#39;s a bit... inept, isn&#39;t he?&quot; Buffy agreed.
