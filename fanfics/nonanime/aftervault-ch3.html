   Abigail would have thought that, after the tortures of the day
before, she would be used to the discomfort by the time she woke.

   Naturally, neither the world nor her body were quite so kind.

   She was roused so suddenly and from so deep a sleep that whatever
nightmare flash she might have woken to was gone before it had appeared
at all. That was, in some ways, a relief. Once awake, she could quickly
clear her head of her bloody memories, and focus on her more immediate
and physical pains.

   Putting on Rathley&#39;s shades she was glad to see that, as the tent
came down around her, she had not been placed on Chopper&#39;s blood
stained table again for the night. The patch of sand she had slept on,
while less deep than the last, had still cushioned her and left her
hips and shoulders less sore. They should have felt worse, she knew,
but Chopper&#39;s painkiller shots, which helped her sleep, would still
last well into the day. That was something she was eternally grateful
for.

   After their wasteland hike the day before her legs felt like lead.
She dreaded to think what condition they would be in if she was able to
feel them fully. However, they did still work, and she found her feet
slowly but steadily while the desert travellers packed up around her.

   As she stretched out her aches it struck her how quickly the novelty
of having surface people around her had worn off. For all their quirks
and foreign charms, they were not like normal people; like the people
of Vault 42. They obviously had some sort of camaraderie between them,
but it was not one based upon friendships, or care for each other&#39;s
wellbeing.

   &quot;Hey, how&#39;s our precious little invalid? Ready for another little
stroll? Ha ha!&quot;

   Rathley&#39;s loud comment, and the subsequent rock that Kyle threw at
his head after tripping over the unpleasant man&#39;s belongings, summed up
her point quite well.

   &quot;Jesus! Bags, old man. Either pack them up, or I hack them up for
our next fire!&quot;

   Abigail was no stranger to chastisement over her late waking hours,
untidiness, and her &#39;overly energetic&#39; conduct through the vault
corridors. She had been well known among her friends for the extra
hours she was made to do at work, or the groundings she got from her
proud and over-protective parents.

   &quot;You do and I&#39;ll cut your fucking ears off to match your balls,
boy!&quot;

   But they had never threatened her with physical violence over her
misdemeanours. They had never belittled her simply for falling sick.
Back in the vault she had taken her punishments because she knew she
had earned them, and she had genuinely tried to do better, because that
was what everyone had needed of her. Everyone had to work together if
they were all to remain safe, comfortable and happy in their
underground home. Of course people had their fallings out, and fights
occurred, but only over the worst incidents. Real crimes, and real
inconsideration, were the unpleasant exception.

   Here, they appeared to be the norm. Instinctively she looked for
Sharn. She did at least show that she really cared, even if she was
just as strangely foreign and discomforting as the other three. And
Sharn just shouted up for her... boyfriend? Husband? According to her,
Kyle could take anything that Rathley could dish out, and still make
the older man lose control of his bowels before begging for mercy. And
in fewer words too. That was the side of Sharn that scared her. The
savage girl that appeared when she thought Abigail wasn&#39;t looking.

   Absently Abigail reached behind her to hold the metal loop that hung
as a tie for her long pigtail. However, pulling it into her fingers,
she found that it was no longer the piece of jewellery that her mother
had given her for her twelfth birthday. Instead, her hair was pulled
through and tied around a coin, which had an off-centre hole of some
sort through it.

   Had they thrown away her only real piece of jewellery? Chopper had
not said anything about it when she had asked about her equipment. She
forced the emerging tears back, and looked back up to the fighting
pair. Of course they had tossed it. It had probably absorbed too much
radiation to be safe, but it still hurt to lose it.

   &quot;Admiring the circus?&quot;

   Abigail literally jumped, letting out a cry of surprise when Chopper
made her presence known. How long had the coarse woman been standing
behind her?

   Abigail turned away from scene with a definite worry joining the
hungry crawl of her weak stomach. &quot;Not really.&quot;

   Then she swallowed hard, realising just how rude her tone had been.
It had been honest, but at the same time she knew that she was in no
position to be making open judgements about these people. Even if they
had thrown away her possessions, her life was depending on their
willingness to keep her alive.

   Chopper raised a single questioning eyebrow, and Abigail couldn&#39;t
help but feel nervous at it, but Chopper did not say any more. She just
gave Abigail that worrying smirk, and offered her a bowl of root mush.
&quot;Is that so? Well then, maybe something to eat will take your mind of
them.&quot;

   Abigail took the bowl and looked down at it. It was the same
unpleasant, fibrous sludge that she had tried to eat the day before,
and only partially succeeded. And this time it was wetter, obviously
with the salt-water medication stirred in. She was starving, she
couldn&#39;t deny it, but could she really force herself to eat this again?
And again at lunch, and again at dinner, if she was lucky enough to be
provided with three meals instead of one?

   What choice did she have? &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said in a quiet voice,
and she tried to sound grateful, but given the smirk that stayed
plastered on Chopper&#39;s face she did not know when she had succeeded.
She scooped up a spoonful of the wet mush and tried to swallow it down
as fast as her throat would allow without making herself ill.

   &quot;Don&#39;t rush it,&quot; Chopper advised as she turned away to watch the
unfolding scene between her companions. They were still sniping at each
other, or rather Rathley was sniping at the once-again allied Sharn and
Kyle, and they were returning the favour. And all three actually seemed
to be enjoying the abusive air.

   &quot;The best medicine tastes like shit,&quot; Chopper added. &quot;Heh, it&#39;s a
good thing you don&#39;t need the best.&quot;

   Abigail chose to believe that she was trying to reassure her, but
either way, it was rather more information than she needed as she
slowly ate her salty gruel. &quot;Yes. A good thing, I guess.&quot;

***

   Abigail did get lunch as well, despite her pessimistic morning
thoughts. In fact the atmosphere all around was lighter than the day
before, such that Abigail could put her troubled thoughts behind her
and simply walk without the frequent bouts of bickering that had
plagued the last leg of this exhausting journey. It might have been
helped by the fact that she did not feel up to trying to make
conversation with them, so once they had settled down and back into the
routine of marching along she could simply see them as the ragged
wanderers that they were, and not in such a judgemental light.

   It helped that Rathley was not a talker once he was moving. His
carefree and vulgar opinions vanished beneath the craggy mask of a...
Abigail did not know what animal it was that he resembled, but he
resembled it well. He did not so much turn serious, but simply started
to pay a keen attention to the eternal expanse of rock and dirt around
them. His attention was on the &#39;out there&#39; and not on the rest of the
group. And, as Abigail was forever realising as they marched, there was
so much &#39;out there&#39; to see. What he was paying attention to, or looking
for, or feeling with his surface dweller&#39;s senses, Abigail could not
begin to guess at.

   But it kept him quiet and engrossed as he walked along behind them,
with Chopper in front. It gave Kyle and Sharn time to talk together,
and talk to Abigail.

   &quot;Abby-girl, are you holding up okay?&quot; Sharn finally asked, after she
and Kyle had run out of their own conversations, only half-heard and
not listened in on by Abigail. &quot;Are you legs tired? I&#39;m sure Chopper
has something...&quot;

   It was true, Abigail&#39;s legs ached something fierce. They ached to
the point that they hurt anew, especially now that the day was wearing
on, and the drugs wearing off. To begin with they had ached with
stiffness, and she had longed for a good hot bath. Then they had ached
with the exercise, on top of the exertions of the previous day. And now
they ached with tiredness, moving not with a simple thought but with an
effort of willpower not to be left behind, or be verbally put down for
holding them up. But she could still go on. Her muscles protested, but
the food and her slow but steady recovery gave her the stamina to
continue.

   &quot;She&#39;s not due for another shot until sundown,&quot; Chopper added to
Abigail&#39;s mental list of reasons. &quot;Too much of my stuff and she&#39;ll end
up numb and walking like a floater.&quot;

   Abigail didn&#39;t want to know what a &#39;floater&#39; was anymore than she
wanted to hear about Rathley&#39;s &#39;deathclaw&#39;. Right now &#39;bed&#39; or even
&#39;sand&#39; would have held her interest, but not much else.

   &quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; she said, a little out of breath, but still sounding
strong, even if she didn&#39;t look it right then. &quot;And I won&#39;t need
holding up this time.&quot;

   &quot;Ambitious,&quot; Kyle said with a joking smile, and though it didn&#39;t
feel welcome he did not let Abigail&#39;s lack of similar humour put him
off this time. &quot;We&#39;ll be going a bit longer today, you know. At least
until Corva&#39;s watch towers come up in the distance.&quot;

   He pointed out to a speck just below the horizon. &quot;Three wooden
points on that dot, once it&#39;s become a wall. That&#39;s your target.&quot;

   Abigail squinted through her shades at the dot. He was right. It
wasn&#39;t just a rock ridge. It was a proper artificial shape, just about,
even at this distance. The sight pumped a flood of energy into her
heart. &quot;A town. A real town.&quot;

   &quot;Corva,&quot; Sharn confirmed. &quot;It&#39;s not a bad place, and there&#39;s plenty
to keep people coming back, even this close to the Cobalt Line.&quot;

   &quot;There has to be,&quot; Kyle added. &quot;Since their crops aren&#39;t a sure
thing with all the rads and nasty creatures about. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a
good place to find work. There&#39;s always someone wanting something done,
or it&#39;s the end of their job! A real melodramatic bunch.&quot;

   &quot;Yeah, tell me about it,&quot; Sharn said, &quot;but they&#39;re decent. They&#39;re
ghoul-friendly, they&#39;ve got some sort of sport running in the pens
almost every day, the traders won&#39;t cheat you too bad on ammo...&quot;

   &quot;They got a brothel full of absolute talent, I&#39;d say second best
within two caravans&#39; ride.&quot;

   They ignored Rathley, although Abigail was surprised that they
didn&#39;t argue the point either.

   &quot;We can get you fixed up real good with the stuff you were lugging
around. Some of that&#39;s gotta be worth some decent leather at least,&quot;
Kyle finished.

   Abigail wasn&#39;t so sure. &quot;I need to sell it all? What am I supposed
to do after that?&quot;

   &quot;Hey, it&#39;s your stuff, you do what you want with it. I&#39;m just
saying, some of that&#39;s gonna be worth more than the effort of lugging
it around.&quot;

   Abigail guessed Kyle was right. Especially since he was the one
carrying the majority of her supplies and books.

   &quot;And we&#39;ll look after you,&quot; Sharn went on with her smile on her
face. &quot;We know what it&#39;s like out here, so we&#39;ll watch your back so you
don&#39;t get suckered into anything. So don&#39;t worry. And you can rest up
while we sort out our pay for this waste of a trip - I mean besides
finding you, this was a bust - &#39;cus that&#39;ll probably take a bit, and
Chopper&#39;s put you through too much as it is.&quot;

   At the sound of her name Chopper joined the conversation. &quot;Since
we&#39;re on the subject, there&#39;s a few things I want to lay down *before*
you start introducing yourself to everyone and their dog.&quot;

   Abigail didn&#39;t like the sound of that. Chopper had rules. But then
they were probably for her own good. She was the naif there. &quot;Uh, such
as?&quot;

   &quot;Hm, one: don&#39;t trust people too much. You got lucky with us, and
even we might have sold your ass if you hadn&#39;t turned out to be
worthwhile.&quot;

   Abigail looked up at the woman in front in alarm, only to have her
soften the warning.

   &quot;And you&#39;ve proved yourself for now. Just keep it in mind, you might
not want to stick with us, or anybody out here.

   &quot;Two: don&#39;t think you can survive alone either. If you can&#39;t use
people when you need to, then learn. If you get in with the right ones
at the right time then they might owe you for it, and that&#39;s worth more
than that gun you&#39;re so desperate to have.&quot;

   Abigail&#39;s surprise turned a little sour. &quot;I don&#39;t *want* one. I
don&#39;t even know how to use them! I nearly broke my shoulder with one
when I killed that last bastard monster in Vault 42! I just don&#39;t want
to end up with a knife in me either. You&#39;re the one who said I needed a
weapon.&quot;

   &quot;Then bartering away some of those books and things for some
leathers is just as worth while as getting a gun or knife. And hell, if
you don&#39;t want a gun you can chuck rocks at the raiders when they turn
up if you like! Anyway, learn who your friends are, because even if you
don&#39;t have a gun or a spare stimpak, they might.&quot;

   And under that was an undercurrent that Abigail could hear. She
might not be able to trust them fully, but she *did* owe them her life.
It was up to her whether she reneged on that debt.

   &quot;Three: When you&#39;re not hobbling around, don&#39;t take it as a sign to
be a hero when some stupid prick pulls a gun out, or start making
trouble. If you stand up, you&#39;re their first target for that shiny
magnum. There is a difference between bravery and idiocy, and not many
idiots get the chance to learn from their mistake. They&#39;re too busy
bleeding out all over the floor.

   &quot;Four: I don&#39;t know what the stance might have been in that vault of
yours, but don&#39;t fuck anyone out here. You don&#39;t know where they&#39;ve
been, and you sure as hell don&#39;t want some of the shit that they might
be spreading around.&quot;

   That brought all three of the others up short. Especially Rathley.

   &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve been layin&#39; the best of them for fucking years, and bein&#39;
damn good at it, so you can blow it out of your ass, Chopper! Don&#39;t
spoil my chances with the kid before I get to get it on with her!&quot;

   &quot;What?! Like you&#39;d ever have a chance with her!&quot; Sharn shouted back.
&quot;She&#39;s got to have better taste that that!&quot;

   Abigail most definitely agreed. Sharn didn&#39;t know how right she was.
Rathley would never have had a ghost of a chance with her, and even if
that hadn&#39;t been the case he was... nasty.

   &quot;But seriously Chopper,&quot; Sharn started, &quot;that&#39;s just...&quot;

   &quot;It&#39;s going to keep her clean at least,&quot; Chopper justified. &quot;You
don&#39;t want to know some of the sick diseases I&#39;ve been asked to treat.
And especially for a girl there&#39;s often not much anyone can do, not
even me. At least for a guy you can take a knife to his dick if it&#39;s
bad enough. And,&quot; she said to Rathley, &quot;I&#39;ll look forward to the day
when I finally do lower myself to touching your prick for that very
reason.&quot;

   Rathley gave her the finger and a few nasty words in reply, but
Chopper was trying to make a point. &quot;Rathley&#39;s still clean because he
knows his whores and skirts are clean. No flop house will ever keep a
girl who&#39;s caught something, and around here at least the customers get
checked over to make sure their girls and guys don&#39;t catch anything in
the house beds.

   &quot;So, until you know they&#39;re clean, keep your hands to yourself. I&#39;ve
tried to keep three women alive after they caught black widowmaker, and
the one who survived the treatment was worse off than when it was
rotting away at her insides. Except she&#39;s alive now, and the others
aren&#39;t.&quot;

   Even Rathley couldn&#39;t say anything to that. It was alarmist, but
apparently all too true. Abigail felt her lunch roiling in her stomach
at the thought of what Chopper had described. If it was supposed to
make her feel humble and honest, the lecture had worked. &quot;You really
don&#39;t have to worry about that.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to leave them room to
enquire, but she was too late in asking what rule five might be.

   &quot;Say... you&#39;re not a woman yet?&quot; Sharn asked. She looked genuinely
surprised, but the question didn&#39;t come with any of the expected
ridicule. &quot;You know, I&#39;m sure we can find you a clean...&quot;

   &quot;No, really, just don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m not in a rush for that
kind of thing right now.&quot; Especially not out here, she thought, but she
sighed hard to clear her head. &quot;What about number five?&quot;

   Chopper shrugged. &quot;If I think of one I&#39;ll let you know. I thought
I&#39;d save the best for last.&quot;

   Abigail didn&#39;t thank her for that.

   &quot;Eh.&quot; Kyle evidently didn&#39;t like the rather awkward silence that
followed. &quot;Anyway, all that crap aside, you could find a lot of worse
places to heal up than Corva. It&#39;s not quiet, but it&#39;s got mostly
decent people and lots of decent places to waste your caps if you&#39;re in
the mood for it.&quot;

   Abigail blinked at yet another unfamiliar term. &quot;Caps? You mean
money?&quot;

   Kyle nodded. &quot;Heh, I guess you didn&#39;t have bottle caps down in your
vault.&quot; He fished into the pocket of his jeans and pulled out a bottle
cap to toss at her.

   And it was exactly what she had thought it couldn&#39;t be. The cap from
a bottle of beer or soda - she couldn&#39;t tell which, it was too faded
and worn. It was bent, and with most of its printing scratched or
rubbed off.  &quot;This... is money up here?&quot;

   &quot;Sure,&quot; Sharn said, again looking surprised. &quot;Why do you think Nuka-
Cola is so expensive? Free money.&quot;

   Abigail had to stifle a slightly hysterical giggle. And to think of
all the bottles and their caps just sitting in their vault&#39;s store
rooms, carefully rationed and re-used for over sixty years to make sure
there was always enough vault-brewed beer to go around at festival
time. No wonder the drink had been so carefully distributed. No wonder
the bottle caps, with a little careful and creative thinking, could be
though of as just as valuable, being finite, as the drink they kept
safe. And out of some perverse habit of collection, had they kept their
value on the surface long after the refreshment they had protected was
gone?

   Suddenly the surface was not just a frightening place. It was
becoming weird, and in the most unsettlingly logical way. Abigail was
glad that the town in the distance was growing its towers as it came
closer, because she was worried that she was beginning to understand
something of this surface world, and right then even something was
simply too much!

***

   That night, as the four wastelanders made camp, Abigail sat staring
at the town in the distance from beneath her cape. Although she was
tired beyond belief, she felt as though the sight of those three wooden
towers, marking the bounds of the buildings below, could have kept her
going for hours. Only the relief at finally being able to rest upon her
little rock cushion, followed by the promise of painkillers and sleep,
had stopped her.

   Somewhere in that town, beneath the uneven line of the roofs, there
would be a bed. A real bed, with a real mattress and blanket, and a
bathtub, and maybe even something other than salty root gunk to eat.
She did not want to say it for fear of the answer she would get, but
her sore skin was not helped by the sticky jumpsuit that she had been
wearing the last two days. Her other, the one she had walked out of the
Cobalt Line in, had been thrown away. The last thing her skin had
needed was what had been baked into that cloth.

   But those had been her only two sets of clothes. She had always been
owed one of the spare jumpsuits in the vault, but it had never actually
been provided. She had guessed it would have been given to her on her
twentieth birthday. Her tired heart fell a little further at the
memory. There would be no more birthdays, and no more festivals. But,
she thought, perhaps she could find such things out there in the
blasted desert. Performing had been her passion. Surely there would be
a chance to do so if there were people who would watch.

   As long as they weren&#39;t all people like Rathley.

   She was wrested from her thoughts when Chopper sat herself down on
the hard ground by Abigail&#39;s rock. &quot;Nice to see you keeping up this
time.&quot;

   Of all the things Abigail had not needed right then, it was
Chopper&#39;s beside manner that had ranked a solid second place. She
didn&#39;t know what a &#39;pig-rat&#39; was, but just the way Sharn had said it
those two days before had made it sound like an accurate description
for the medic when it came to personal skills. &quot;I&#39;m tired, Chopper.
Please leave me alone.&quot;

   The woman shrugged, unconcerned by the dismissal. &quot;Too bad. I guess
you&#39;ll just have to watch us eat then.&quot;

   Abigail turned to see Chopper dropping a pair of turnip-like roots
back into her medical box. &quot;W-Wait!&quot; She exclaimed, before Chopper even
had a chance to get up. She was feeling lousy, but with the town so
close to her she was not so depressed as to want to miss the chance for
a third meal, no matter how disgusting. And God was she tired of this
power game. &quot;I want to eat, okay? I&#39;m sorry. Just... don&#39;t talk to me
like that. I don&#39;t want to be your pet, or your unwanted child. I&#39;m
trying, but it&#39;s hard. I&#39;ve lost my home, and my family, and everyone I
ever cared about, and it&#39;s not my fault I nearly died out here!!&quot;

   She almost screamed those last words, and hadn&#39;t even realised it.
She looked up at the other three, still erecting the tent. Sharn looked
shocked, but Kyle was grinning from ear to ear, and Rathley looked as
though he was trying with all his might to stop himself from unleashing
his crude wit on Chopper, and only succeeding because he wanted to hear
her reply.

   For her part Chopper looked at her with raised eyebrows, and blew
her breath out through her nose before sitting back against the rock,
not with a frown or a glare, but a satisfied and perplexing sort of
smile. &quot;At least your backbone looks like it&#39;s healing.&quot;

   Abigail tried hard not to look pleased, but she was. She had just
got away with being something other than the invalid or the hanger-on.
She was also relieved that the woman hadn&#39;t shot her for it, and that
only added to the thrill of it. It made her feel a bit bad - she had
been raised not to be confrontational with other people that way - but
that little show of independence made her feel a lot better about
herself.

   &quot;Um, I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;

   Chopper interrupted with her usual casual bluntness. &quot;I&#39;d suggest
exercising that backbone if you want it to heal properly, Abby.
Everyone loves a shrinking violet, but only because they can be stepped
on so easily.&quot;

   Abigail took the hint and allowed herself to feel good about it. She
dropped the subject and just continued to watch the others as they
worked, rather than turning back to stare at the town. Watching Kyle
and Sharn finish putting up the tent was a picture of efficiency. Sharn
followed Kyle&#39;s lead as if on instinct, while the leather armoured man
pulled everything taut for his companion to pin into the earth.

   And Rathley, his job on the shelter apparently done, had moved over
to examine the rocks at the side of the camp. As last time, Kyle had
wanted to pitch the tent next to an outcropping of rocky ground, larger
this time with several insanely out of place boulders resting against
the rubble and the small wall of protruding earth. There was enough of
the debris for the aging man to climb well out of sight.

   Then she heard him strain against something in the clear evening,
followed by a loud thump. It made Abigail jump a little, not having
expected it in the slightest.

   &quot;What&#39;s he doing?&quot;

   Chopper continued to mash Abigail&#39;s dinner, not looking up.
&quot;Pretending to be good at his job.&quot;

   Sharn, looking slightly dustier than usual after erecting the tent,
ambled over to join them. She was far happier than Chopper to actually
explain what was going on.

   &quot;The men are going to get us some dinner,&quot; she said, plopping
herself down on the same rock, next to Abigail. &quot;They&#39;re both way
better at catching iguanas and geckos than us.&quot;

   Just as she said it a not so small lizard, about the size of
Abigail&#39;s forearm, came flying through the air from Rathley&#39;s
direction. It sailed over Kyle&#39;s head, its arms and tail floating
limply in the air, before landing with a thump on the ground.

   To Abigail&#39;s distaste, its head had been crushed flat, and it bled
slowing over the ground. Suddenly food didn&#39;t seem as welcome as it
had. Especially since the bloody lump above its shoulders reminded her
far too vividly of another green, caved-in skull that she had inflicted
the damage on herself.

   &quot;Oh God, that lizard.&quot;

   Sharn looked at her as if to ask what the matter was. &quot;That&#39;s
dinner. And not as puny as the ones last night either. Really, it&#39;s not
bad, for lizard. Didn&#39;t you have iguanas underground?&quot;

   Abigail shook her head. &quot;No. No, we didn&#39;t! I thought you were all
eating those roots and plants, like me. Or that cake-thing in the
packet Rathley had for lunch.&quot;

   &quot;You should know by now,&quot; Sharn replied, &quot;Rathley&#39;s a freak. Those
pre-war MREs taste like toilet paper. And you can&#39;t just live on desert
weeds.&quot;

   &quot;Actually you can,&quot; Chopper said, mixing some of the medicine into
Abigail&#39;s bowl. &quot;But why put up with it if you don&#39;t have to? Even the
drugged up tribals hunt for meat.&quot;

   &quot;Hey!&quot; Sharn exclaimed, indignant about something there, but Abigail
was paying more attention to the hunt. Rathley had scrambled back over
the rocks a little way, and both he and Kyle seemed to be hunting in
one patch of smaller rocks. Rathley crawled across them like a reptile
himself, while Kyle stood poised and still as a statue with a knife in
his right hand.

   Nothing seemed to happen for a while, except for Rathley&#39;s crawling
over the boulders, until in the blink of an eye Kyle was no longer
standing, but crouched down with his knife buried behind the rocks. And
when he came back up, the iguana was writhing on his knife, the blade
piercing right through its body.

   &quot;Ha,&quot; Rathley condescended. &quot;Lucky shot, boy. But you won&#39;t take the
lead.&quot;

   Kyle smirked at him and reached for the lizard&#39;s slowly twisting
neck. And he snapped it. &quot;The head start won&#39;t do you any good, old
man.&quot;

   &quot;This is a game to them,&quot; Abigail realised.

   &quot;Hunting is so boring,&quot; Sharn said, defending the pair. &quot;I never
learned, because even with Kyle teaching me it seemed like such a waste
of time. It&#39;s a sport for them, because otherwise it would drive them
mad.&quot;

   Abigail watched as Rathley caught his second iguana, this time in
full view. His method seemed to lack the skill and precision of Kyle&#39;s
method, but it was far more productive. Kyle was waiting for the
opportunity to strike as the creatures fled or slowly explored their
way into the evening from their burrows and cracks, whereas Rathley was
actually trying to drive the iguanas where he wanted them do go. And as
soon as one made its mistake, Rathley&#39;s strong hands were around the
right rock, and he only needed a second to heft it clear of the ground
and bring back down a few inches further away, onto the creature&#39;s head
or back.

   But Rathley did not win the match. Kyle benefited from the iguanas
that did not flee where Rathley wanted, and instead headed back to
their cracks beneath the rocks, where he was poised. They both caught
two, making one lizard meal for each of them except Abigail.

   And even with her gruel as her only other option Abigail did not
want one. She felt a little sick as she watched them gut their animals,
before spitting them and lowering them over the fire that Sharn had
started. There had been no dry brush by the rocks this time, but the
desert girl had been carrying enough to make a modest fire as the light
had faded.

   &quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want some, Abby-girl?&quot; Sharn asked, offering
some of her barbecue, but Abigail still refused.

   Abigail didn&#39;t consider herself a vegetarian, but she had been one
by circumstance rather than by choice. She had never seen an animal
prepared for food, and nor had anyone in the vault ever expected the
knowledge to be necessary. They had no livestock to butcher, and all
the meat they ever needed could be grown and synthesised from the
fungal hydro-farms, rather than slaughtered. Livestock would have been
a massive drain on both food supplies and space within the vault, as
well as a health risk in the unlikely event of disease. The technology
had existed to make animal farming redundant.

   It was not the ideology of eating meat that made her nauseous as she
ate her root paste so slowly and carefully. The simple reaction to
seeing the creatures killed, and eaten right from the carcass, was
disturbing enough to her.

   &quot;She couldn&#39;t even if she wanted to,&quot; Chopper illuminated, before
adding, &quot;Or have you finished pissing blood, Abby?&quot;

   Abigail, newly brave against her situation, gave her a dark look for
her invasive remark. But Chopper was her doctor, so she still had to
answer. &quot;No. No I haven&#39;t. If I could, believe me, I would.&quot;

   &quot;But it doesn&#39;t hurt now, right?&quot; Sharn asked. Abigail wondered how
the young woman could be so kind, and yet so insensitive about her most
personal issues as well. It wasn&#39;t her fault it hurt to pee, and it
wasn&#39;t her fault she was &#39;only a girl&#39; either.

   But she nodded in defeat. Chopper deserved her newly reclaimed ire.
Sharn didn&#39;t. &quot;Not as much.&quot;

   Chopper smiled, enjoying the sight. &quot;That&#39;s something then.&quot;

***

   For some reason, despite her fatigue and the influence of the shot
Chopper had given her before she had turned in, Abigail found it
difficult to sleep. For the first time since coming to the surface her
mind was overriding her body and refusing to rest, and not just because
of the hard ground beneath her. The surface was undoubtedly a barbaric
place, she had realised, but more than that it was simply primitive.
Vault 42 had required a vast amount of maintaining, but in return it
had provided them with everything they had ever needed.

   The surface was a different world altogether. Food had to be found
or grown from the ground up. Clothing and necessities would not be
provided; she would have buy or barter for them. An occupation would no
longer be provided for her, and she would now be left to find her own
place and her own path in life.

   She was sure she was capable of it. She knew she would have a great
deal to learn, but she had time to learn it, and it seemed that her
rough saviours wanted to keep her around. The idea made her
uncomfortable, but she knew that she could use them. She could learn
from them, and they would show her how to live on this backwards
surface. Her thoughts now were not on whether she could survive, but on
how best to do so.

   And she couldn&#39;t wait around to be handed the opportunity. All her
life she had been brought up knowing who she was and what was expected
of her in the future. No-one would give her that security now. She had
to take it, or remain helpless. She would need to discover what her
options were, but she was sure they were out there. If these people
could make their livings wandering the wasteland, then she could surely
put her skills to good use for similar types who could not work their
own machines properly, or did not understand the sciences she had been
taught. It was, in a way, freedom to survive however she wished.

   And it terrified her. Only hours before the town had seemed like a
beacon of hope, except she had not had any idea of where she might fit
into such a place. Just that it existed had been hope enough. All she
had wanted was proof that humanity still existed as a community, like
Vault 42 had been.

   But what kind of community? It would be the kind these wasteland
people knew, and lived within. It would not be hers. She did not know
the customs, or what was expected of its people, or their attitudes
to... anything at all. She had only just learned how these people ate,
and like almost everything else about them, it seemed *wrong* to her.
As bad as it made her feel for thinking so, it was no longer enough
that humankind had survived. She wanted to be a part of it again.

   The more she thought about it the more uncertain she made herself,
and yet she could not shut those thoughts out of her mind and sleep.
They were too pervasive. It was almost a relief when Chopper joined
her.

   &quot;You&#39;re still awake?&quot; the woman asked. &quot;You won&#39;t last tomorrow
without sleep.&quot;

   &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; Right then she did need someone to talk to. Even if it
was Chopper. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to think any more. I don&#39;t know what
I&#39;m supposed to do.&quot;

   &quot;What? You&#39;re not... You&#39;re supposed to sleep. That&#39;s it.&quot;

   Of course, it didn&#39;t make her feel any better. &quot;I&#39;m scared! It&#39;s all
wrong! You people are wrong! What am I going to do like this?&quot;

   Chopper huffed. She lay down in her clothes, pulling her coat over
herself as a makeshift blanket. &quot;Ether you&#39;ll get over it, or you&#39;ll
die.&quot; As expected she did not try to reassure Abigail with her tone,
&quot;And I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be doing any of the second, or else I&#39;ll take
my fee out of your hide. Or did you *try* to kill yourself out there,
and the vault story was just one big lie?&quot;

   Abigail felt a furious tear fall down her face. &quot;It wasn&#39;t! It
wasn&#39;t a lie! You think that I...&quot;

   &quot;Good,&quot; Chopper interrupted. &quot;If you&#39;ve still got the will to live
then you&#39;ve got enough to stop feeling sorry for yourself. And if
you&#39;re not, then prove it. You&#39;ve been tough enough to last this long,
so sorting yourself out once we get to town will be child&#39;s play.&quot;

   That wasn&#39;t the point, but Abigail held her tongue. She did need to
knuckle down and sort herself out, and it wasn&#39;t as though she expected
it to be easy. But she was tired of the worries, and her insecurities.
Even if it had been a lie, she would have liked someone to humour her
and say that it was all okay.

   Lying there, staring at the canvas overhead, Abigail would have
asked where Sharn was. She would have been some comfort. But before
Abigail even had time to think of asking the point was rendered moot by
a distant, happy moan. The first of several, which were unmistakable
Sharn&#39;s, and soon unmistakably Kyle&#39;s as well.

   Abigail found herself feeling rather awkward, listening to them. The
pair, though only caught in the odd loud gasp or sound of exaltation,
sounded very energetic for two people who had been travelling on foot
all day. Though wholly inexperienced Abigail had heard sex before, and
that was not the sound of the slow lovemaking she remembered hearing
while fixing the air circulation systems over bunkroom 703, when
Jacquelyn and her much older and evidently very gentle boyfriend had
persuaded their roommates to take an evening at out. This was more...
lustful, she guessed.

   Chopper let out an annoyed sigh of her own. &quot;Her resolve didn&#39;t last
very long.&quot;

   After a moment, and a few more overloud gasps, Abigail spoke again.
&quot;They&#39;re... just having sex out there? On the ground?&quot;

   Chopper gave a cutting laugh. &quot;Knowing them, Sharn&#39;s probably stark
naked and up against a rock.&quot;

   Mercifully the sounds did not last too long, but before the reprieve
came they were treated to every audible detail of the pair&#39;s out-of-
kilter orgasms.

   Again, after a moment of silence that Abigail found uncomfortable,
she asked, &quot;They are in love, right?&quot;

   &quot;Apparently so. If not, they certainly get enough practice to fake
it annoyingly well.&quot;

   Abigail didn&#39;t know whether to be glad for them or jealous. She
would have given anything to have someone hold her right then, but at
least it gave her hope if these surface people could genuinely fall in
love. She also hoped that tomorrow would come before she had a chance
to dream, because she really didn&#39;t want her dreams, or her nightmares,
to become any more lurid after that.

***

   To Abigail&#39;s relief she got her wish for the most part. The sun was
already high in the sky by the time she was awakened by the bright
deconstruction of their tent, and she had slept well enough that only
an underlying sense of guilt remained from whatever unremembered dreams
she&#39;d had, instead of the more usual fears. Whether it was pleasant
guilt or regretful she couldn&#39;t tell, so it dulled the experience, but
it either way she considered it an improvement.

   She put on her - Rathley&#39;s - sunglasses before opening her eyes. The
ground was hard beneath her, but she was in no rush to get up. The town
of Corva was waiting for her, and she was nervous about meeting it.

   After a moment the others must have noticed her lack of enthusiasm,
because the clear sky was suddenly replaced with Kyle&#39;s towering form.
&quot;Time to see some real civilisation after all this wasteland, Abby!&quot;

   Civilisation. She doubted that the town would quite fit her
interpretation of the word. She didn&#39;t fight it though. It was either
that or living out in the desert, and she had lived through enough of
that to last her a lifetime. &quot;Alright.&quot;

   Abigail knew that her lack of enthusiasm had not escaped their
attentions, but she tried not to meet Sharn&#39;s looks of sympathy or
concern. It still unsettled her that she and Kyle had had sex the night
before, out there in the wilderness, and she didn&#39;t quite know how to
look at them now. They didn&#39;t seem to behave any differently with each
other at all, but it was there. In Abigail&#39;s mind there was now a sort
of distance between herself and the wild looking young woman. She could
no longer be Abigail&#39;s crutch, because Sharn had her own life and her
own needs and intentions. It had made Abigail realise just how little
she had been thinking of Sharn as anything more than emotional support.
Likewise Kyle seemed that bit more approachable, a bit more human, but
then why would she want to approach the man simply because she could?
To him, she was &#39;something else&#39;. Something other than a wastelander.

   Just as he, just as all of them, were something other than normal to
Abigail. Touche, she thought.

   &quot;You nervous, Abby-girl?&quot; Sharn asked. &quot;Really, it&#39;s not such a bad
place.&quot;

   Abigail didn&#39;t want to hear it, and changed the subject. &quot;You said
it was &#39;ghoul friendly&#39;, and you,&quot; she added, turning to Rathley, &quot;said
that &#39;at least I wasn&#39;t going to go ghoul&#39;, back when you found me.
What is a ghoul? &quot;

   Before then she would have asked herself whether she really wanted
to know, but now she knew that she didn&#39;t have that luxury. After the
bottle caps and the iguanas she could not afford to be naive any more.
She couldn&#39;t take anything for granted, or assume she knew what
anything would be like from here on. She had to swallow her fear and
discover these things, or else she would never be able to survive, with
or without these four travellers.

   Rathley, though his attention never strayed from the desert around
him, was the first to answer. &quot;You see a dead old timer staggerin&#39;
around and talkin&#39; to his navel and stinkin&#39; the place up, that&#39;s a
ghoul. You can&#39;t miss the fuckers.&quot;

   Kyle and Chopper chuckled at the description. Sharn didn&#39;t.

   &quot;They&#39;re people, sort of,&quot; Kyle clarified, &quot;but they&#39;re ugly looking
bastards with skin falling off and not too many marbles left. Ancient
old people from when the bombs hit, who soaked up too many Rads but
changed into something else before it could kill them. Nasty. I heard
them called zombies too, but &#39;ghoul&#39; is what most call them.&quot;

   &quot;They&#39;re nice people, mostly,&quot; Sharn said, trying to re-clarify
Kyle&#39;s clarification. However, Abigail could tell she was having a hard
time trying to paint them in a good light. &quot;I mean, when they&#39;re not
rabid and crazy. They&#39;re just... old, and senile a lot of the time.
Most of them turned when the bombs hit, so they&#39;ve been alive for
longer than any human. It makes them weird sometimes. And sometimes
they can be unpleasant to look at because of what the bombs did to
them.&quot;

   Chopper didn&#39;t have time for Sharn&#39;s attempt at the considerate
approach. &quot;They&#39;re ugly bastards, full stop. Decent ugly bastards
sometimes, but you don&#39;t want to live with them. They should be dead
but the radiation changed them, just like it changed a lot of things
out here. So they might look dead, and even have their guts hanging
out, but it won&#39;t bother them a bit. They&#39;ll die of old age eventually,
but until then they&#39;ll keep wandering around and talking at everyone
about glowing water and ghoul haters and whatnot.&quot;

   It sounded farfetched, even for the surface, but then what evidence
did Abigail have to say that it wasn&#39;t true? &quot;... Really? They&#39;re dead
people?&quot;

   &quot;Not dead,&quot; Sharn replied. &quot;Just old, and... falling apart a bit.&quot;

   &quot;It doesn&#39;t happen to everyone who gets radiated though,&quot; Chopper
went on. &quot;Usually radiation poisoning kills you before it can change
you. Plus, anyone who took radiation meds would just die. Lower the
radiation in your blood and it just gives it more time to kill you, not
more time to keep you alive. We&#39;re talking massive amounts to turn
ghoul. If you&#39;d come out of the Cobalt Line *without* being half dead
from Rad-X overdosing, then *maybe* that would have done it.&quot;

   The idea sounded pretty grim, but if these ghouls had been alive
since the two hour war then maybe they could tell her about it. About
what her Grandmother had escaped as a child.

***

   Looking at Corva from the outside, Abigail wondered whether it was
less of a town and more of an overgrown village. She doubted that there
were more than a hundred buildings, and she used the word &#39;building&#39;
loosely. From the southwest side the majority of them seemed to be
constructed out of scavenged materials and put together in the style of
a shanty town. Walls and roofs seemed to be put together out of
anything from wooden boarding to corrugated steel to large plastic
panelling, all bound together with a mix of welding, rope and earthen
cement.

   The few homes that did look purpose built from the start still
betrayed their origins as scrap buildings, with metal poles still
poking from the clay walls at strategic points. Such building would
obviously stand up to weather better, but under the seemingly constant
sun that was probably not so necessary.

   But it was a town, and while not as pretty as she had hoped it was
more than a dry field of tents. The town apparently had two main
streets, one bisecting the town neatly from the south east to north
west, along which the markets and shops were arranged, and another wide
road reaching north east from the rough middle of that street, which
provided the main road into and out of town. It also gave access to the
market street for the town&#39;s &#39;police&#39; and the trading caravans.

   When she asked, the police were spoken of with less than reverence
by all four of Abigail&#39;s saviours. They were more a small group of
armed would-be mercenaries, paid for by the sheriff and mayor of the
town. They were alternately heavy handed and impotent, and served as an
image to make the town feel safe more than to actually enforce any law
on the place. The caravan guards often did that more than well enough
as it was.

   And at either end of the market street, and at the main gate, there
was a watch tower. They were not actually that tall, only a few metres
higher than the roofs around them, which was why they had been so
difficult to see from the distance. But they, more than anything else,
gave the rows and clusters of ragged and earth-made buildings a sense
of organisation and purpose. It was not a wasteland slum but a real
town, lived in and protected by real people.

   Also, as they were approaching from the rear of the town, the
buildings were bound to be shabbier, Kyle had explained. That was where
most of the homes were. The town from the market street forwards was
for the bars, hotels, hostels and police quarters. The &#39;nightlife&#39;, and
the people to control it.

   The town, to Abigail&#39;s surprise, had no outer wall. They could have
walked right in through the buildings at the back. &quot;That&#39;s not kosher
though,&quot; Rathley said, as they instead skirted the edge of the town.
&quot;The watch tends to get pissy if you just walk in. Wouldn&#39;t do much for
the town if people just came and went like that, and missed the main
streets. And no-one&#39;s mad or tough enough to come here from the Cobalt
Line anyway, except exploring parties. And you, Sugar.&quot;

   But Abigail saw the flaw in that plan, just at the same time that
Kyle and Chopper did. &quot;But, is there even anyone up there? Are the
playing cards some sort of town symbol.&quot;

   Rathley looked up and squinted at the tower to see what Abigail
meant, and Abigail checked again, just to be sure she wasn&#39;t confusing
them unnecessarily. The oversized playing card was still there in the
open side of the watch tower; a seven of diamonds.

   Looking around at the others, Abigail saw that Rathley&#39;s words could
have come from any of them. &quot;Oh for fuck&#39;s sake!&quot;

   Abigail looked to Sharn. &quot;What is it?&quot;

   &quot;The fucking Diamonds,&quot; Sharn said, with a mix of growl and fed up
sigh. &quot;Listen Abby-girl, just stay put. We might be able to make a
little loot out of this, but this isn&#39;t a joke. The Diamonds are
raiders, and they&#39;re either coming this way or they&#39;re already inside
the town. They&#39;re pathetic ones, but they still have guns. Good guns,
usually.&quot;

   Kyle nodded. &quot;Stay here, the both of you. Rathley, Sia, let&#39;s have a
look around.&quot;

   Chopper gave him a smile. &quot;You don&#39;t have to tell me twice. Have fun
playing with your guns, and try not to make too much work for me.&quot;

   For Abigail it wasn&#39;t as simple as that though. &quot;Hey, wait a minute!
What do you mean...&quot;

   But the three of them were already gone, slipping through between
the building and disappearing. And, just on sheer confused impulse,
Abigail followed.

   &quot;Hey, where the hell do you think you&#39;re going!?!&quot; Chopper called
after her, but Abigail wasn&#39;t listening to her. She was trying to
ignore the pain in her legs, and the lost, confused feeling that had
filled her the moment her three companions had left, and most of all
the voice inside her head that was screaming &#39;IDIOT!&#39; at her.

   After she had passed a dozen or so houses she slowed to a walk. What
on earth was she doing? They had told her to stay behind, and told her
so for a very good reason. She was sick, and unarmed, and knew nothing
about the town or about the raiders that were coming or were already
there. She might end up with a knife or a bullet in her back, and she
would never have known what hit her. She had just followed them on
scared impulse, not even thinking, and what had it got her?

   She spun around, suddenly panicking at her own foolishness. No-one
was there, but that only made her feel more isolated. She had panicked
when Sharn, Kyle and Rathley had left her so suddenly, and she panicked
even more, because now not even Chopper was with her. She spun back,
and again nothing.

   And now she had no idea which way was forward, and which was back.
The houses all looked the same to her. A part of her said just to stay
put. Someone would find her.

   She chose a direction and started walking, as slowly and carefully
and quietly as she could, because she didn&#39;t *want* anyone to find her.
Soon, she knew, she would emerge from the houses. Either it would be on
the outside, and she could follow the town edge to find Chopper again,
or it would be the inside, and she could simply turn around.

   But it seemed to take a very long time. Too long. And everyone was
gone. The town seemed deserted. Were they bundled away in their houses,
she wondered, or were they out there where the trouble was?

   And then she reached the edge. On the inside, between a fruit stall
filled with ugly green and red things, and a caravan piled high with
boxes.

   And in front of her, she saw everyone. It must have been half the
population of the town. And if they turned her way, everyone would see
her. She suddenly looked for somewhere to hide, and threw herself
behind the fruit stall. It was low, but she could hide behind it, and
that was all that mattered.

   There had been a line of brave and scared looking people on the
other side of the street, looking on at the spectacle. There were lots
of them, these Diamond raiders. Abigail knew which had been them in an
instant. The onlookers had worn normal clothing, or the mish-mash of
cloth and leather that passed for normal on the surface. Several
others, the police Abigail guessed, wore leather armour much like
Kyle&#39;s, only more complete in its coverage.

   The raiders on the other hand, they looked even more ridiculous and
bizarre. They had paler skin than most of the onlookers, and it made
even more of a contrast since most of them were wearing black leathers
of their own, but ones that looked more fashionable that protective.
The outfits had torn sleeves, legs and backs and those tears were lined
with jewellery, marking every gash and every bullet hole, and even the
worn holes in the knees and elbows. Every tear was highlighted in gold
and silver and gemstones, from broken rings and necklaces to messily
crafted adornments of their own making.

   Abigail, through her fear, thought that they could at least have
dressed in red instead of black. Diamonds were supposed to be a red
suit.

   And, as Sharn said, they carried guns. Pistols, rifles, shotguns,
even a big, long machine gun of some kind. Abigail poked her head up in
morbid fascination. Seven raiders - for the seven of diamonds on the
watchtower card, she surmised - each with a gun of their own that
looked far more polished than the old thing that Chopper had in her
belt. They could have killed everyone in the crowd in seconds, if they
had wanted to.

   But it looked like a stand off. The police had their guns trained on
the Diamonds, and the diamonds were returning the favour, so if anyone
shot anyone they would probably kill off more than half of each other&#39;s
people. There were more police mercenaries than raiders, but the
raiders had their guns on more targets, by the look of it.

   And, even if anyone had wanted to take the risk and wipe out the
Diamonds, they held their fire because one of the raiders, presumably
the leader by the way he was talking, had a hostage. Abigail couldn&#39;t
see her clearly, she was looking on from behind, but it was a girl, and
a short one at that. A teenager, certainly.

   On the other side, the Sheriff was trying to talk the Diamond into
releasing the girl, but the more she listened the more Abigail could
see that it was never going to happen. The girl was not just a hostage,
but the prize as well.

   &quot;I ain&#39;t going to give her up, old bastard! Erin&#39;s mine, and I ain&#39;t
gonna leave her in this shithole just so the Hearts can have her!
You&#39;re gonna die anyway geezer! You want that for her too? &#39;coz  if
she&#39;s gonna die anyway, I&#39;m gonna be the one to do it! No Heart&#39;s gonna
rape my girl!&quot;

   &quot;I&#39;m not &#39;your girl&#39;,&quot; the hostage retorted, but she squealed as the
raider held her tighter and pressed his large, silver pistol into her
temple.

   &quot;You can be,&quot; the raider hissed to her. &quot;Trust me, you&#39;ll learn! Do
you want to die here?!&quot;

   She noticed that his gun also dropped a little as he whispered to
her, and the police also noticed. In a moment almost half of both sides
had switched their targets, and both the Diamond leader and the sheriff
were shouting for them to hold their fire. The crowd fled like panicked
birds as the machine gun&#39;s sights passed across them in that moment.

   Abigail ducked behind the stall again, though now, with a clearer
head, she was no longer so sure it could protect her from the gunfire.
When nothing came of that crisis, she poked her head up again. The
police had all of the raiders covered now, but several raiders with
pistols now had a second in their other hand, or a melee weapon in
their fingers. And the machine gun was now pointed directly at the
sheriff.

   And Kyle was standing with those few petrified or gutsy people where
the crowd of onlookers had once been. He also had a gun in hand, just
like the one that Diamond leader her against the hostage&#39;s head. Did
that mean that Rathley and Sharn were also out there?

   Abigail felt a swell of courage. She was hidden, behind Raiders, and
no-one had a gun trained on her. If she could give them the
opportunity, then Sharn and Kyle and Rathley could take it from there.
It wouldn&#39;t have to be a big thing. Just a little bit of help, so that
the Diamond&#39;s gun wasn&#39;t pointing at the hostage. Really, there would
be no risk at all, and she could hide again before anyone knew what had
happened.

   She had found them down behind the stall, when it looked like they
would start firing. A small basket, filled with very hard, round
things. Some sort of nut or gourd, but just bigger than a softball.

   Wall darts had been Abigail&#39;s favourite vault sport, but softball
had been fun as well. She had always been picked in the first three,
during the matches in physical conditioning class, because she pitched
so well.

   So pitch she did. But not towards a batter. It wasn&#39;t a throw for
fun. It was a throw that hoped very hard that the Diamond would not
pull his trigger out of reflex, and out of anger, that someone could
consider human life so expendable.

   But she had chosen her moment, when the raider leaned in to whisper
at his hostage again, and his gun slipped slightly backwards so that
his lips could reach the girl&#39;s ear. That would be enough. She prayed
that would be enough. She prayed so hard that she forget to duck back
down as the giant nut struck the man full in the side of the face. It
pitched him to the side, and his arms flung out in surprise as he tried
to stay on his feet.

   Then the shooting started.

   From some hidden corner the rifle shot rang out, and the lead
Diamond&#39;s head jerked yet again, taking the unbalanced man clean off
his feet and whirling sideways through the air, spraying blood from his
temples like a perverse toy fountain. His huge silver pistol did fire,
but way off target as he flailed in the air, and his bullet disappeared
into a clay wall down the street.

   Then everyone else opened fire. Abigail screamed and jumped out of
her skin as she realised that she was still standing in the middle of
those streams of flying lead, but she couldn&#39;t move. She was paralysed
by the flashes and the spraying blood, and by the raiders and the green
phantom monsters that paraded in front of her shaded eyes.

   Somewhere in that mix she saw Kyle, striding forward confidently
without a single gun trained on him, and his giant pistol tore into the
arms of the machine gunner before he could even fire of a single shot.
Two more bullets put the Diamond down for good. The police all opened
fire with their pistols, to mixed effect, while the two that held
shotguns filled another shotgun wielding Diamond with so much metal
that he flew for metres before falling to the ground in a bloody,
mangled heap. Two of the pistol Diamonds put their bullets into the
better armed police men that covered them, leaving only a single
mercenary alive, but with a nasty shot to the stomach for his trouble.
Somewhere in the distance another shotgun barked out and the only
uncovered raider keeled over with a scream, peppered with shot. The
sheriff put him down for good.

   And that left just a single raider, and another single sniper shot
that took his own rifle from his hands with brutal efficiency. But he
was otherwise unharmed, and he had been the one to see Abigail standing
there and panicking with her hands over her ears. And, with his gun now
gone and an unseen rifle trained on him, he broke into a run. Abigail
had the cover he wanted, and she had been the cause of the slaughter.

   Abigail&#39;s eyes met his, and his were eyes that burned with desperate
vengeance. He, like the other Diamonds, had his backup weapon at his
side, and he pulled the rusty crowbar from the gilded rope around his
waist and swung it back in one swift motion. Abigail panicked as the
raider closed the distance, and she reached for another of the pitching
nuts. They were all she had.

   The raider had reached the stall, ready to dive over it to meet her,
when Abigail rose and threw her pathetic weapon. At that same moment
another shot rang out, and a bullet punched its way through the
raider&#39;s black jacket. It was a shallow shot, only catching his side,
but it made his back arch in pain, and gave Abigail enough time to
throw her improvised weapon into his face at point bank range.

   The Raider fell back with the force of it, his nose breaking
audibly, and he howled in pain. Abigail, full of terrified adrenaline
and anger at the man who had been about to cave her skull in, leaped
over the stall and onto his fallen body. He screamed again and clutched
at his punctured side as she landed feet first on his stomach.

   Abigail&#39;s feet hurt like hell now, but she was too blinded by rage
to stop. She picked up the Diamond&#39;s fallen weapon, and returned his
favour. This time, in one sickeningly familiar stroke of the crowbar,
she left her enraged mark on her target. She broke his face with it.
Then his skull. Then his ribs. Then his sternum. Then, with a desperate
wail, she let the dull, rusty curve of the weapon hit what bloody pulp
remain of the man&#39;s head, before it fell from her exhausted, limp
fingers.

   And then, before she realised it, Chopper was beside her, shouting
in fury. &quot;Abby! What the *fuck* did you think you were doing!?&quot;

   And then Rathley came, wearing a metal shell over his chest,
applauding. &quot;Holy shit Sugar, that was crazy cool!&quot;

   And then Kyle and Sharn. &quot;Hell, Abby,&quot; said the pistol man, &quot;that
was nuts, but god damn if it didn&#39;t give Sia the perfect shot! You&#39;ve
got some serious guts.&quot;

   &quot;Yeah, that could have been... Abby-girl?&quot;

   And all Abigail could do was cry, clutching herself to Sharn as if
the wild girl could undo it all. Tension, anger, adrenaline, fear,
confidence; it all exploded from her in the most wracking tears Abigail
had ever cried.

   And Sharn held her until she was done, turning the girl away from
the body of the man she had killed. She might have said something, and
the others might have replied, but Abigail couldn&#39;t hear them over her
own confused grief.

   It was a while before the rest of the world existed to her again,
and the noise was much louder than she remembered. The deafening roar
of gunfire had been replaced by cries of relief and joy and sorrow, and
strange people were dashing to the bodies of the fallen, only to be
warned away by the sheriff and the men of his that remained unharmed.

   And the sheriff was looking towards the hostage and Chopper as they
talked, now some way off. They seemed to be discussing something,
though the more Abigail watched the more convinced she became that it
was an argument. The sheriff shouted something to them angrily, and
Chopper ignored him. Instead the hostage just became more upset and
irate, before Chopper turned angry herself and walked off.

   Away from Abigail.

   The hostage, however, did turn her way. Now that Abigail could see
her, even through her sore and watery eyes, it was clear that the girl
was young and pale skinned. She was about sixteen years old and slim
faced, frail even, and with her black hair bobbed around her cheeks.
She wore a simple long sleeved cotton top, and a heavy skirt that
reached down to her ankles. Quite different from the mass of minimal
shirts and various trousers that those around her preferred.

   &quot;You&#39;re Abby, right?&quot; The girl asked in a quiet, unsure voice. &quot;Um,
my name is Erin. Thank you. For helping, and not getting me killed.&quot;

   And just like that she nodded to Sharn, and Kyle, ignored Rathley,
and turned away.

   Kyle smiled as they watched her leave. &quot;This could be interesting.&quot;

   &quot;What do you mean,&quot; Abigail replied, sniffing back her tears and
trying to steady her shaking hands. &quot;She and Chopper were fighting. Do
they know each other?&quot;

   &quot;Heh.&quot; Rathley smirked. &quot;Know each other? Our doc stole that girl&#39;s
innocence. Seduced her right and proper. And Dad wasn&#39;t too happy about
it either.&quot;

   Abigail was too stunned by that to say anything.

   &quot;She&#39;s not too happy about Butcher-girl leaving with us disreputable
types either.&quot;

   &quot;You&#39;re the only disreputable one here, Rathley.&quot;

   Abigail was still stuck several sentences back though. Chopper, and
that Erin girl... had been together?

   She looked down in contemplation, only to see the mangled body at
her feet, bleeding onto the dry ground. Her stomach turned horribly.
&quot;Oh God.&quot; She swallowed back the taste of bile, and had to turn away.
&quot;Can we leave please?&quot;

***

   Abigail looked up, staring at the comfortingly familiar grey of the
ceiling. The crumpled white sheets barely covered her, or the dreadlock
haired girl that lay sleeping around her, but for that very reason
Abigail was warm enough. She smiled to herself at the mumbled noises
Gillian breathed across her cheek. The girl really was quite adorable
when sleep had robbed her of all that confidence and bravado.

   How could she have failed to fall in love with her? Gillian was tall
enough to hold her as the protector rather than the protected, and sure
enough to know what she wanted, and ask for it. Yet when she was dopey
and ready for sleep, or for a good lie in, she could be petted and
coddled like a kitten, and she lapped up the attention as such.

   The vault rested quietly, leaving nothing but the ceiling and the
girl in her arms to occupy her mind. It was the kind of dream that,
when dreamt often enough, could been seen as such while she was still
dreaming it. After all, they were not sixteen any more. Nor had Gillian
ever accepted her virginity, or even her love. It was a fantasy that
had plagued her many times when she had been that age, but she was
happy to see it again after so long.

   She resisted that dream temptation to look down at Gillian&#39;s face,
or at the floor below the bunk they shared. Anything to reveal the
dream as something else - anything disturb this warm and loved feeling
- had to be avoided at all costs. She did not want to see what the girl
she had once loved might become in her arms, and she knew that beneath
them on the floor would be the stuff of nightmares.

   So, as tempting as it was to give in to the nightmare, she stared
upward and remained happy. She would let herself believe this wonderful
fiction until the waking world came to take her away.

   Abigail was a virgin, and she had not been afraid to admit as much,
but it had been a matter of circumstance, rather than choice. For as
long as she could remember having the notion of love, be it as
idealised romance or as hormonal urges, she had always seen herself
together with a woman, rather than a man. She had on occasion
fantasised about men, she had tried very hard at times, but the notion
had always left a worrying and uncomfortable distaste in her. Just as
her friends had said they felt in those candid confessionals when they
admitted having tried to think of themselves with other women.

   Being gay had never been an issue in the eyes of Vault 42. Race,
colour, gender and sexuality were all as equal as they could be.

   Except that out of a little over three hundred men there had been
only one openly gay couple. And no other lesbians. Not one. At least,
not one that had ever come forward, or said as much on their census
reports. Abigail knew. In her desperation one night she had done the
unthinkable, and with her friend Daniel had broken into the vault
computer&#39;s census records. He had been looking for other things, but
Abigail had had only one thing in her mind. Was she going to live and
die without anyone to love her as anything more than a daughter or
friend?

   That despair had come soon after the girls&#39; candid little sixteen-
year-olds talk about their boyfriends and sexual interests, or lack
thereof. Abigail had rarely felt uncomfortable about anything they had
ever had to say to each other. She was a confident and wilful girl, but
that night she had said very little.

   Jacquelyn had been the obvious star that night. She had never been
overly beautiful by anyone&#39;s standards, but her attitude had been more
than enough to win her a boyfriend almost twice her age. Had her
parents known they would have lynched the poor man. Karen had her
sweetheart from level nine, and being inseparable after being minded
together since the age of four, she confided that they had already got
to know each other as much more than friends. Geeky Patricia had always
gone on about her designs on various members of the security teams, and
claimed that she would act on them as soon as they accepted her
constant petitions for a vocational change. Alice, ever level headed
and studious, was waiting for a husband from her eventual career as
well, and intended to be well read on how to keep hold of him once she
found him. Funnily, Dee, who was privately known in their little group
as rather obsessed with procreation, had spent the whole night beetroot
red. She just didn&#39;t know who she wanted, or how to get them. Jacquelyn
spent an inordinate amount of time sharing her &#39;secret&#39; with the girl.

   And Gillian, like Abigail, had been mostly quiet, and looking rather
awkward. Abigail had dared to hope that Gillian might also have had
preferences that ran the other way, since she chose not to speak up
when the subject of &#39;alternative sexuality&#39; was broached. After all,
Gillian had always been a bit of a rebel. Perhaps that was a part of it
as well.

   She was wrong. When she had come out to Gillian that night, after
the others had all returned to their bunk rooms, and confessed her
attraction to her, Gillian had not responded in kind. She had not even
let her down gently. She had simply frozen, and stammered out a defence
of her heterosexuality before getting as far away from Abigail as she
could, leaving her alone in the library after lights out.

   And Abigail had stayed there. Better to wallow in her grief and be
scolded the next day than return to her family bunk room and be asked
for a reason for her tears.

   And Gillian had not spoken to her after that. In such an enclosed
environment avoiding someone required effort, and Abigail feared that
she had lost her best friend forever. That had been the reason she had
gone with Daniel to hack into the vault census&#39; two days later. Little
had she known that, on the third day, Gillian would seek her out after
their studies, and apologise so much that they would both end up
weeping again.

   Gillian could not return Abigail&#39;s affections, but that was no
reason to destroy their friendship, although Abigail did wonder on more
than one occasion whether that was the real reason behind the girl
abandoning her to Marcus, and electing to join the night shift. As if
it was just to make sure that things didn&#39;t get too weird. But it
hadn&#39;t stopped them being the best of friends. Abigail had recovered
from her depression, and simply accepted her limited future. Maybe she
would have found someone who had never admitted their sexuality even on
the census reports.

   And until then she enjoyed the dreams, where Gillian - or later, the
married Overseer Beatrice - could be everything Abigail had wanted.

   Abigail smiled, recognising the smell of those silly dreadlocks.
They were hardly clean, but Gillian&#39;s defiance had been a part of her
charm when it came to that kind of thing.

   &quot;Mmmm,&quot; Gillian stirred beside her, &quot;Abby-girl.&quot;

   Abigail realised that it wasn&#39;t Gillian any more. It was a shorter,
stronger girl, older than sixteen, and her hair tickled against her
face.

   &quot;Abby-girl?&quot;

   Abigail felt tears leaking from her eyes as her contentment fell
apart...

***

   ...And she woke up with a shudder, clutching at the thick blanket,
Rathley&#39;s shades still pressed into the sides of her head. The surface
blanket was far to hot for her, even though she only wore her jumpsuit,
and she threw it off herself. It felt scratchy through her jumpsuit,
which was already itching against her skin with two days worth of dry
sweat. She looked up at the ceiling, hoping to see the safe greyness of
the bunk room metal, but her eyes were met by the dry wood of the hotel
room instead.

   &quot;Abby-girl? Sorry I woke you.&quot; Sharn looked at her with such
compassion, but it was not the loving compassion that she had wanted in
her dream. It was the compassion for a poor, helpless little kitten.
&quot;Are you feeling okay now?&quot;

   Abigail sat up, and rubbed at her watery eyes, trying very hard not
to look like she had been about to cry. She was stronger than that.

   &quot;No,&quot; she said, sounding as bitter about the question as she felt.
It was unfair, she knew, but she was *not* feeling better. &quot;No, I&#39;m
not.&quot;

   &quot;Abby-girl,&quot; Sharn said in sympathy. She obviously wanted to ease
her mind, without knowing why Abigail was behaving this way after being
so vulnerable and quiet. &quot;He was a raider. A Diamond! He got exactly
what he deserved!&quot;

   &quot;I didn&#39;t want to become a murderer!!&quot; Abigail shouted back, staring
daggers at Sharn.

   Behind the desert girl Chopper walked through the door of the hotel
room. &quot;You started that fight, and you finished it. What did you
expect? You&#39;d rather it was you with a crowbar in your skull?&quot;

   She gave Abigail a very fearsome look, and Abigail retreated further
back up the headboard of the bed.

   &quot;And you started a fight, with raiders, without a weapon or anything
on but that nothing of a skin suit. You should be *dead* after what you
pulled!&quot;

   &quot;Chopper!&quot;

   &quot;Shut up, Sia.&quot; Chopper&#39;s eyes never left Abigail. &quot;I told you what
to do, and you tried to get yourself killed the first chance you got.&quot;

   &quot;I was *scared*! I panicked! And that bastard *deserved* it!!&quot;

   &quot;Then murder was exactly what you wanted, wasn&#39;t it. As long as you
weren&#39;t the one doing it I suppose?.&quot;

   &quot;NO!&quot;

   Sharn stepped in, &quot;Chopper, stop it, that&#39;s enough. Abby, uh, Corva
has very generous looting laws, so I made sure no-one took what&#39;s
yours.&quot; She held up the bundle she carried, held together by the tied
up jacket that the Diamond had worn. Abigail&#39;s share of the spoils from
her kill.

   &quot;GET THAT AWAY FROM ME! JUST... GET IT OUT! Please! I don&#39;t want
it!&quot;

   Abigail could feel the tears flowing freely down her cheeks again.
What the hell was she doing, being offered her victim&#39;s clothes and gun
and God only knew what else?

   But there wasn&#39;t any God up on the surface, she realised with a
sudden, haunting clarity. She may have been lax in her prayers, and
skipped chapel in favour of the gymnasium or a good book, but she had
believed.

   Now she didn&#39;t. Not any more. Just like that. And Abigail Iseley
suddenly felt very small. All she could do now was put her head in her
hands and weep for what she and the world had become.

   &quot;I&#39;ll just... I&#39;ll leave these outside, Abby,&quot; Sharn said quietly,
and sounding unsure of where she should be.

   Chopper on the other hand just sat at the room&#39;s battered and broken
looking dresser, and waited for Abigail to finish. Outside they could
hear Sharn and Kyle talking, but what about was muffled beneath
Abigail&#39;s sobs.

   Once she could bring herself to raise her head again, she found
Chopper waiting. She wanted to spit out some horrid rebuke at the
woman, but her mind didn&#39;t seem up to the challenge. All she could
manage was to glare.

   Chopper returned the look with a curious one of her own, before she
got to her feet. &quot;Alright. Strip.&quot;

   Abigail&#39;s glare faltered and fell. &quot;W-what?&quot;

   &quot;Strip, Abby. Take that skin suit off. I might as well see how your
body has fared these last few days, since it&#39;s obvious you won&#39;t be
getting out of that bed.&quot;

   Abigail&#39;s glare returned, but with much less vitriol behind it.
After a full minute without winning the war of stares, she looked away
and peeled herself out of the clothing. She was learning to hate this
world even as she became more and more a part of its dirtiness and
brutality, but she still wanted to be healed. &quot;... Fine.&quot;

   And so she lay resoundingly silent and hideously naked while Chopper
looked her over with keen eyes, back and then front, poking and
prodding her all the while.

   &quot;Just scream if it hurts too much,&quot; Chopper said, but Abigail was
steadfast in ignoring what was being done to her. And in truth, it no
longer hurt as she was touched and moved around. The sting whenever
something pressed her skin had faded dramatically over the last days,
and her muscles protested only in exhaustion from all the undue
exercise, not out of irradiated agony. She could swallow free from
discomfort, and her abdomen only twinged instead of crying when
Chopper&#39;s tough hands explored it, pressing down into her belly.

   Her hands were not so red now, and were peeling, but they only
itched, instead of stinging. The same was true of her face, which she
assumed was similarly ugly.

   But looking at herself her real worry was that her ribs showed, at
her sides and under her meagre breasts. She did not feel starved, the
root mush had averted that, but she looked it. At lest she recognised
her muscles as still being there. It was nice to know that she could
not lose her athlete&#39;s form after only a few weeks inattention.

   She was also glad that Chopper&#39;s fingers did not cause her to recoil
when they alighted on her right shoulder. Whatever injury the shotgun
had inflicted on her had been long in fading, but it had now gone.

   But no matter how she tried to ignore it, she was painfully aware of
the examination, and of her nakedness. Had this been her life for those
three days she had spent unconscious and in Chopper&#39;s care? The thought
made her very uncomfortable. She was also aware that Chopper&#39;s eyes
might be doing more than the medical examination she had thought, back
in the desert. If she was a lesbian, then what was Chopper&#39;s judgement
on her? Did she even have one? Abigail knew that she herself would not
have been able to avoid having an opinion, had their positions been
reversed.

   &quot;Chopper?&quot;

   That eyebrow of hers rose again. &quot;Yes?&quot;

   &quot;You&#39;re... gay, right? Lesbian, I mean.&quot;

   Chopper smirked. &quot;Yep, as bent as they come.&quot;

   Somehow hearing that, even from someone like Chopper, was such a
great relief.

   &quot;... I am too.&quot;</pre>
