<h1>Goodbye Earl: Afterwards</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Mary Anne woke to the sound of the rooster crowing, blinking away the 
last remnants of sleep from her eyes. The tall, redheaded woman smiled 
as she took in Wanda laying there beside her, the little blonde looking 
so innocent as she slept. Slipping out of the bed Mary Anne padded 
barefoot from the master bedroom to the kitchen, starting up the coffee 
then pouring herself one once it was done.

&#39;Wonder how long it&#39;ll take for Wanda to wake this morning?&#39; Mary Anne 
mused as she looked out the window at their farm, the chickens 
tentatively moving out into the yaed, the pigs out in their pen in the 
back. A few years ago this would have seemed impossible to her, but a 
lot of things had changed since then.

Mary Anne had known Wanda for years, all through their high school days. 
Both had been in the same clubs, they hung out together, they were the 
best of friends. Of course Mary Anne never told her best friend some 
things, like how her heart would skip a beat when Wanda smiled, looking 
up at her so tenderly.

Wanda had been stunned when Mary Anne had told her she was leaving on 
graduation, but she didn&#39;t feel she had any choice. The small town had 
been closing in on her more and more, and she also felt more and more 
drawn to Wanda in ways she knew were... wrong. So after telling Wanda 
that she needed to look for a bright new world she left, in truth trying 
to find others like her.

Atlanta had been a revelation to Mary Anne in more ways than one. She 
found a job, found a place to live... and found the bar. After a night 
or two of hesitating in the little caf&eacute; across the street Mary Anne went 
inside, and entered a new world. Men dancing with men, women swaying 
close together, dressed as they chose and doing what they wanted to. The 
first time Mary Anne got asked to dance she thought she was going to 
faint, but in time she got used to the racing of her heart, the sweet 
excitement.

Still, Mary Anne never seemed to find a girlfriend or really settle 
down, all the dates seemed to be lacking something. She told a few 
friends about Wanda, not specifics but enough for them to understand, 
and the nodded sagely. Most had had a first crush like that, but few of 
those worked out in the long term. They told her to put it behind her, 
to move on and give her love to someone else.

Then Mary Anne heard about Wanda being hurt.

Booking the first redeye out of Atlanta Mary Anne hurried to Wanda&#39;s 
side, speeding her rental car along 109 and luckily avoiding any radar 
traps. Wanda was a mess, battered and bloody and Mary Anne was stabbed 
with guilt over leaving her side, especially after hearing about how 
Wanda had taken up with Earl after she had left. Both of them talked 
long through the night, and in the end they made up their minds: Earl 
had to die.

It was all remarkably easy, actually. Earl, as arrogant as hell was 
unsurprised when Wanda took him back, and while he DID notice the odd 
flavor of the peas it was far too late by then. Wrapping him in a tarp 
they went out to the lake and gave him the old heave ho into the water, 
weighed down so he&#39;d sink like a rock.

There had been a scary moment when the police came by the house the next 
morning, but they had been coming to take Earl in for assaulting Wanda. 
Both of them knew the good-ole-boy network would protect a friend like 
Earl, and both felt a degree of satisfaction on ridding the world of a 
piece of filth like that.

Without really thinking about it Mary Anne agreed to stay with Wanda 
after that, regretfully saying goodbye to her friends back in Atlanta 
and doing her computer job from their new home. Wanda, needing something 
to do, bought a space at the roadside stand on highway 108 selling the 
ham they raised along with strawberry jam made from her mother&#39;s recipe.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; a familiar voice asked, arms circling her waist as 
Wanda hugged her from behind.

&quot;Just thinking,&quot; Mary Anne smiled down at her.

Wanda moved on tip toe to kiss Mary Anne, &quot;I missed you when I woke up.&quot;

It was a lingering kiss, one of a lover and like always Mary Anne just 
melted into it. &quot;I wish we had done this years ago,&quot; she murmured 
softly.

&quot;You might have told me,&quot; Wanda moved to stand by Mary Anne&#39;s side.

Mary Anne reached out to put a arm around Wanda&#39;s waist, drawing her 
close. &quot;When you told me to stop using the couch and get in bed with 
you, I knew I was in trouble,&quot; Mary Anne murmured.

&quot;I lay in bed beside you that night longing for something,&quot; Wanda lay 
her head against Mary Anne&#39;s arm, &quot;I barely slept.&quot;

&quot;Join the club,&quot; Mary Anne laughed, &quot;if you hadn&#39;t made the first move I 
thought I was going to burst into flames or something.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Wanda laughed. She looked up at Mary Anne, &quot;The first time I 
touched you it felt so right... I wasn&#39;t even scared.&quot;

&quot;It was right,&quot; Mary Anne hugged her, &quot;for us.&quot;

&quot;I still want you to take me out to that bar in Atlanta,&quot; Wanda added 
after a moment, recalling a earlier conversation.

&quot;It&#39;s a pretty rough place,&quot; Mary Anne warned.

&quot;It&#39;s part of the new world that you found,&quot; Wanda said, &quot;a new world 
you helped me discover.&quot; A grin, &quot;Besides, I thought we could dress up 
to the nines and have some fun.&quot;

&quot;We haven&#39;t had a night out in while,&quot; Mary Anne conceded the point, 
&quot;what do you have in mind?&quot;

Wanda reached up to tidy the men&#39;s pajamas that Mary Anne always wore to 
bed, &quot;I was thinking a slow dance to start, me in that slinky dress and 
you in your suit...&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mary Anne croaked as she felt Wanda press up to her.

&quot;And maybe go back to the hotel then and,&quot; Wanda fluttered her eyes 
suggestively, &quot;rest.&quot;

&quot;We tend to do a lot of,&quot; Mary Anne grinned, &quot;resting.&quot;

&quot;You can never have too much rest,&quot; Wanda made circles on Mary Anne&#39;s 
chest wither her pinky finger. Suddenly Mary Anne bodily picked her up, 
bringing a squeal of surprise from Wanda, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

&quot;I suddenly feel very tired,&quot; Mary Anne winked, &quot;we&#39;re going back to 
bed.&quot;

&quot;Whatever you say, dear,&quot; Wanda sighed happily.

End

Notes: I always got a sort of &#39;Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop 
Caf&eacute;&#39; feel from Goodbye Earl, so writing a story around it wasn&#39;t hard. 
Not sure if it was intended by the Dixie Chicks, but heh. They never do 
explain why Mary Anne left town on graduation, so I went with her being 
a closeted lesbian and the plot just flowed from there.</pre>
