<h1>Revenge Road (part 6 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/revroad-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The Veritech fighter&#39;s engine roared as it streaked
across the sky, the engine purring as it reached it&#39;s
destination. &quot;This is Izzy Randal,&quot; the redhead
radioed ahead on the special frequency, &quot;requesting
clearance to land.&quot;

&quot;Permission granted,&quot; the voice said as the airfield
on the desert sands lit up, guiding her down.

&quot;Thanks for agreeing to fly me out here,&quot; Lisa Hayes
said from the back seat, her long brown hair flowing
over the shoulders of her dress uniform.

&quot;Anything to get me back out in my plane again,&quot; Izzy
chuckled in reply as they descended to the Nevada
airfield and what was once called Area 51. While
having been released from sickbay the doctor had
insisted she not fly any combat missions for another
week, just to be safe from any lingering effects of
her concussion.

&quot;You&#39;re not feeling any ill effects from flying?&quot;
Lisa asked Izzy as they rolled to a stop on the barren
rock, then the concealed lift slid them beneath the
desert floor and down into the hidden research and
development base of the RDF.

&quot;I&#39;m fine, ma&#39;am,&quot; Izzy sighed.

&quot;And don&#39;t call me ma&#39;am,&quot; Lisa added teasingly,
&quot;we&#39;re away from the ship and I doubt anyone here
would care.&quot;

&quot;Yes Lisa,&quot; Izzy flashed a smile as they dropped
through layers of armor and earth into the facility
itself.

&#39;God, she&#39;s cute when she smiles,&#39; Lisa thought. Busy
technitians on multiple levels studied salvaged
Decepticon parts, worked on new weaponry and strived
to improve the weapons humanity was fighting to
survive with.

&quot;Welcome aboard,&quot; the commander said, his uniform
crisp and neat as the dusky skinned man smiled at them
cheerfully as Izzy opened up the cockpit hatch.

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; Lisa said as she climbed down from
the plane, rushed over and gave him a hug, &quot;does
Claudia know you&#39;re here?&quot;

&#39;Who the...?&#39; Izzy watched their affectionate embrace
and felt a odd emotion stirring within her breast, one
that almost felt like... jealousy. &#39;Why would I feel
jealous?&#39; Izzy wondered, mentally shaking herself.

&quot;Izzy,&quot; Lisa turned to her, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet
Vince Grant, the little brother of our Captain Claudia
Grant.&quot;

&quot;Sir,&quot; Izzy saluted, keeping her oddly mixed emotions
out of her face.

&quot;At ease,&quot; Commander Grant smiled, &quot;any friend of
Lisa&#39;s is a friend of mine. Besides,&quot; he added as he
lead them through the base, &quot;from everything I&#39;ve
heard through Claudia, I almost think I know you
myself.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Lisa asked, frowning slightly.

&quot;Miss Randal is pretty famous in the RDF,&quot; Vince
said politely.

Izzy gritted her teeth, fighting the urge to say
something rude. &quot;Not by my choice, sir,&quot; she said to
him flatly.

Lisa gave him a very pointed look of warning.
Changing the topic she asked, &quot;I understand the second
generation fighter is nearly ready?&quot;

&quot;Thankfully, yes,&quot; Vince nodded eagerly, &quot;the new
light weight armor the Autobots provided was the key
to completing it. We&#39;ll have both improved firepower
and defensive abilities, thought mass production will
be a problem.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Izzy asked, frowning.

&quot;The alloy is going to be hard to mass produce,&quot;
Vince said as they entered a elevator, &quot;so we&#39;ll only
be able to field a limited number of fighters.&quot;

With barely a bump the elevator activated, bringing
them down deeper into the Earth&#39;s surface. &quot;Any idea
who&#39;s going to get these limited number of planes?&quot;
Lisa asked leadingly.

A smile tugged at the corner of Vince&#39;s mouth. &quot;Once
the test pilots are done with them,&quot; he said calmly,
&quot;they&#39;ll go to our aces first, then into the regular
ranks.&quot;

A somewhat more relaxed smile appeared on her face as
Izzy quietly asked, &quot;Then I&#39;m in line for one of
them?&quot;

&quot;Near the front of the line too,&quot; Vince noted with a
sly smile. The elevator came to a stop with a soft
noise even as he looked over at Lisa, &quot;You ready for
this?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not looking forward to it,&quot; Lisa admitted as
they all left the elevator.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Izzy blinked, feeling like she&#39;d missed a
important part of the conversation somewhere.

&quot;You know Gloval left here when he was elevated to
over all command of Earth&#39;s RDF forces?&quot; Vince asked
as they walked down the hall.

&quot;Yes, I think he&#39;s using a Fortress carrier as his
flagship,&quot; Izzy agreed.

&quot;Well, another admiral got bumped over to command
here,&quot; Vince started.

Lisa sighed as she cut him off, &quot;My father, Admiral
Hayes was put in command here over his very public
objections.&quot;

&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Izzy murmured. &quot;And you two don&#39;t get along
too well?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s an officious ass who thinks he knows how to
live my life better thasn I do,&quot; Lisa snarled under
her breath.

&quot;You got that right,&quot; Vince murmured.

They reached the end of the hall, where a guard
waited in front of a armored door. He saluted, &quot;Should
I announce you, Commander Grant?&quot;

Vince nodded, &quot;Please.&quot;

Pressing the intercom button the guard said
seriously, &quot;Commander Grant is here, accompanied by
Commander Hayes and Lieutenant Randal.&quot;

&quot;Send them in,&quot; the voice growled.

The command center within was as busy as the bridge
of a Fortress aircraft carrier, but the buzz had a
different purpose here. Aides studied research data,
went over simulations and badgered scientists for
reports at their various stations, even as their
admiral looked on from the center seat.

&quot;Commander Hayes, reporting,&quot; Lisa saluted, the very
model of a military officer.

&quot;Commander,&quot; the grey haired older man nodded,
looking searchingly into her eyes. He looked over at
Vince, &quot;Commander Grant, would you care to take
officer Randal over to see the research labs? I&#39;m sure
she&#39;d like to see the new models.&quot;

Izzy gave Lisa a questioning glance, and the other
woman nodded slightly in reply. &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; Izzy
saluted him before turning towards the door.

&quot;Lisa,&quot; Admiral Hayes rose as they were leaving,
&quot;let&#39;s talk in my office.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Vince said as they walked away,
&quot;Lisa&#39;ll be all right.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not worried about Lisa,&quot; Izzy boldly lied as
they returned to the elevator and rose a few levels,
&quot;I&#39;m worried Admiral Hayes might get hurt if he pisses
her off enough.&quot;

Vince snorted softly at that comment. &quot;Sure you are,&quot;
he said as he studied the number&#39;s display, &quot;I noticed
you taking your cues from her.&quot;

Izzy gave him a withering look as she said, &quot;Every
good subordinate does that with their commanding
officer.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Vince hid a smile.</pre>
