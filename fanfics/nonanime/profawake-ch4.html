The Unforgiven

xXxXxXxXx 



She wanted to give up on everything, and explain to Raven that it was 
all a mistake, that she was terribly sorry for what she had done.  But 
there was no turning back now.  In order for her to repent for her sins, 
she would have to finish exactly what she started.  As the winds blew 
hard against her form, blonde strands were forced to one side, shadowing 
a portion of her face and only allowing one sapphire hue to see her 
opponent before her.  Her eyes were full of rage and hate, the same 
expression as the man standing confidently before her.  Her fingers were 
clenched so hard, if it weren&#39;t for the gloves, her nails would most 
likely have drawn blood to her palm.  Her jaw was clenched tightly, as 
her silent raged fueled her to not turn and run.  No.  She would not run 
from this fight, not anymore.  This fight she would give her life for.  
This man had taken everything from her, and she held the opportunity to 
return it ten fold.

No words were needed when Terra had showed up in Slade&#39;s layer, several 
hundred meters below the Earth&#39;s surface, and a perfect battle ground 
for the element of rock and stone.  There was no turning back for her 
now.  She had left her goodbyes with Raven in a note tied to a rock she 
regretfully threw through the sorceress&#39; window a week after this had 
all started.  She didn&#39;t want to go back to the tower, but without her 
communicator, she didn&#39;t want to fight the man without at least voicing 
out what her heart yearned to admit.  Such thoughts placed aside, Terra 
stood full of regrets, completely against what Raven had said to her, 
but her bridge had been burned.  There was no turning back.  Even if she 
were to be forgiven, Terra would never be able to live with herself.  
The guilt was too much.  Her plan was to not only take out Slade, but to 
take out herself as well.  Slade finally rose from his colossus chair 
that stood in front of several monitors that held screen shots of the 
Titans Tower currently being rebuilt.  They were quickly shut down as he 
stepped down the steps toward the girl, cracking various tendons and 
bones, and readying himself for battle.

&quot;Shall we get started?&quot;

Terra&#39;s fa&#135;ade flinched for only a moment before she launched herself 
forward in an all out sprint toward the man.  Sure, she could have caved 
in the ceiling upon him, but that would be far too easy, and far too 
painless.  She had more planned for this mercenary.  He taught her how 
to fight, how to dodge, how to use her opponent&#39;s movements to her own 
advantage, and how to conserve her energy.  Yes, this was to be Terra&#39;s 
final stand.



xXxXxXxXx 



Raven leaned against the wall of the hallway, having been unable to 
break down in front of her friends.  She had made the mistake when she 
first arrived to the destruction of her home, and she wasn&#39;t about to 
make the same mistake again.  She had acted as normal as she could 
during the reconstruction of her home, but her energy could only take 
her so far before her emotions became too much for her to bare.  Her 
palms were flat against the wall while her head hung low, her attempts 
to escape the carnage that was the living room the most difficult task 
she had come to face thus far.  Every member of her team questioned her 
reason for leaving her duties of restoring the ceiling and she would  
now come to thank the heavens for Robin&#39;s observational skills.  It was 
him and only him that allowed her the time she needed to rest.

The hallway was torn to shreds, with pieces of the floor and ceiling 
missing, and metal shards sticking out every which way.  Girders were 
bent and twisted beyond repair, and Raven was finally relieved when she 
came to her room, her door fully intact, and ironically enough the only 
portion of the tower where battle hadn&#39;t reached.  She would have to 
remember to thank Koriand&#39;r for that.  She hadn&#39;t spoken more than three 
words since her outburst several nights before, even to Koriand&#39;r.  
Quite frankly, she was afraid of what would come out of her mouth.  
Since then, it had been nothing but a nod or shake of her head, with 
mild facial expressions answering the more exotic questions.

She forced open the doors after regaining her composure, the electricity 
still not up on her side of the tower.  She breathed out a sigh after 
forcing them open fully, her head the first part of her body to enter 
through the frame, lowering while her hair shadowed over the rest of her 
face.  Instantly, she knew someone had been in here.  She could see the 
prints of Slade&#39;s bots upon her what was once a stainless carpet, the 
window next to her bed shattered, and the laptop upon her desk hooked up 
and opened, frozen mostly due to the virus Slade&#39;s bots had uploaded 
throughout the system.  She would have to ask Cyborg for the same 
software he used to reactivate the main computer system.  

She attempted to close the door behind her, but her strength wouldn&#39;t 
allow her to close it fully.  She halfheartedly pounded her fist against 
the metal frame and pushed off the wall, hypnotically making her way 
toward her bed.  Her small hand reached up to undo her cloak, letting 
the light weighted material float to the ground, as if it would lighten 
the burden Raven felt upon her shoulders.  Terra.  She had trusted her 
far too easy.  The look in her eyes when she begged for forgiveness.  
Raven&#39;s eyes closed as she remembered the girl&#39;s words, fresh in her 
memory just short of a week ago.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Raven ... I truly am, and I know it&#39;s wrong of me to ask 
for your forgiveness, but you told me earlier tonight that sins could be 
forgiven.  Please ... I don&#39;t want to lose you as a friend.&quot;

&quot;Slade was right.  You don&#39;t have any friends.&quot;

Her eyes closed tighter as her head fell into her hands, elbows quickly 
propped up by her knees.  Her legs had lifted in an attempt to rid the 
pain in her stomach from rising, but it did no good.  Guilt.  It was a 
powerful emotion, and Raven could do nothing to subdue the pain.  If 
Raven had just tried a little more, none of this would have ever 
happened.  She had to continue to push the girl away when she first 
arrived, and had to be so weary to trust her when she returned.  True, 
she worked for Slade when she came back to the Tower, but she had her 
suspicions.  She should have questioned her, should have trusted her.  
Terra would surely have opened up to her, wouldn&#39;t she?  Would she have?  
All Raven had to do was ask, right?

&quot;Raven?&quot;

The sorceress felt her body still after hearing the voice.  Had she been 
trembling?  Her muscles were so tight, she wasn&#39;t even sure, but her 
hair was a complete mess and shadowing over her already darkened eyes.  
As she pulled her hands away, she felt moisture upon her palms.  Had she 
been crying?

&quot;Raven, are you alright?&quot;  

 I&#39;m far from alright.

&quot;Raven?  Please respond.  I am worried about you...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s open,&quot; Raven finally spoke, her voice barely audible and her 
throat dry and very parched.  Had it been that long since she truly 
spoke?  When she felt the girl&#39;s surprise of hearing her voice, she had 
her answer.

&quot;Ra ... Raven,&quot; Starfire began to speak, stuttering slightly as she 
stood uncomfortably near the doorway.  She watched as the sorceress kept 
a cold glare to a certain spot on the wall, staring as if her eyes would 
burn a whole right through it.  The princess was afraid to have the girl 
look in her direction, but couldn&#39;t stand the lack of attention the 
sorceress had often given her.  She held one leg to her chest, hugging 
it tightly while her chin rested on her knee, the other leg hanging over 
the edge of her bed.  Starfire, realizing she hadn&#39;t spoken since she 
entered, took a few hesitant steps toward the girl.  &quot;The others ... we 
are all worried about you, Raven.&quot;

Raven shrugged her shoulders, once again reverting to silence and 
avoiding eye contact at all cost.  Raven couldn&#39;t break down again, 
especially not in front of Koriand&#39;r.  She had to keep herself distant.  
Don&#39;t let anyone else get close, don&#39;t let them see you ... see you like 
you were mere moments ago.

&quot;Please, Raven,&quot; Starfire pleaded with the girl, knowing all too well 
the emotional wall the sorceress had always attempted to keep up around 
her.  &quot;Why is it you wish to not speak?&quot;

&quot;What do you want from me, Koriand&#39;r?&quot;  Raven&#39;s silence was suddenly 
shattered as her eyes closed, lowering her head even further.  &quot;Do you 
want me to say that I&#39;m alright?  That everything will be okay?&quot;

&quot;Raven ...&quot; Starfire was more than shocked over her friend&#39;s sudden 
outburst, and took a step back.

&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; Raven finally said after a solid minute.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what 
will happen now, I don&#39;t know if anything will be alright, and things 
will never go back to the way they were.&quot;

Starfire had never seen her friend like this.  Even though she had 
gotten the sorceress to open up to her, there were still things she had 
yet to find out about the girl, and her constant shielding of emotions 
were something she had never been able to break.  Seeing the girl 
looking so fragile, weak, and vulnerable ... Starfire just didn&#39;t know 
what to do.

&quot;That bitch,&quot; Raven&#39;s voice became uneasy as her eyes opened, misty and 
clouded lilac hues attempting to keep focused on the carpet while they 
filled with tears.  She tried to hold out for as long as she could, but 
she just couldn&#39;t take it any longer.  &quot;That stupid fucking bitch lied 
... she lied to me.  So ... why?  Why do I feel like it&#39;s my fault?&quot;

&quot;Raven, it is far from your fault,&quot; Starfire seemed to find her voice 
rather quickly, not as fearful as the girl as she once was and quickly 
moved to comfort her.  &quot;Terra ... she was confused.  I do not believe 
she would have turned on us without having a reason.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my fault,&quot; Raven repeated, despite Starfire&#39;s words.  She closed 
her eyes tightly, as the night continued to replay freshly in her mind.  
&quot;I could have stopped this all if I had just been nicer to her when she 
first arrived ... I could have help her, trained her to control her 
powers more ... but instead, she found someone else.&quot;

The thought of Slade merely enraged the sorceress more as she finally 
crumbled under the weight of her own guilt, falling to the floor on her 
knees while smashing her hands down hard onto the carpet.  She let out a 
scream as she smashed her fists repeatedly against her floor, punch 
after punch, hoping that Slade could feel each strike she placed, 
wishing to the gods above that she could tear the man limb from limb.  
If she had anyone to blame, it was him.  Several of the lights in the 
hallway shattered under her own lack of control.

&quot;Raven!&quot;  Starfire attempted to pull the girl back up, and grasped the 
girl&#39;s shoulders.  Raven&#39;s body tensed to the touch, but the stirring of 
emotions had grown far beyond her understanding.

&quot;What was it...&quot; Raven cried out as her muscles grew tired.  Starfire 
strained, but still couldn&#39;t catch the girl&#39;s question.  Her body 
trembled as the redhead pulled the smaller girl into her arms.  &quot;What 
was it he had that I didn&#39;t?  What was it that made her trust him over 
me?&quot;

Finally, Raven collapsed into Starfire&#39;s body, wrapping her arms as 
tightly as she could around her, crying loudly into her shoulder.

&quot;Why did she leave, Kori?  WHY?!&quot;



xXxXxXxXx



Terra threw her right arm outward, hurling a piece of lifted rock toward 
the mercenary.  Slade leaped forward, dodging the strike and reached 
behind his back, pulling out his extending metal staff.  He landed a few 
meters from the girl and ran toward the elemental, who raised her arms 
in defense.  Just short of two meters, a wall of rock lifted, preventing 
Slade from entry.  Terra then rolled to the right, just as the mercenary 
tore through her wall with his staff, forcing it to crumble against his 
weapon.  She quickly pushed herself up and dodged a punch from the man 
who had trained her and raised her knee just in time to parry a round 
house kick aimed to take out her ribcage.  Terra knew the man was 
attempting to keep close range combat to prevent her from using her 
powers, though as Slade himself had taught her, always turn your 
weakness into your strength.

Cocking her right fist back, she hurled it forward, which was easily 
blocked by Slade&#39;s left wrist.  He then grabbed tightly onto it and 
hurled the girl across the room.  Terra spiraled her body around, going 
from landing back first to perfectly on her feet, extending one arm 
outward while the other pressed firmly against the ground, steadying her 
landing and lifting up dust all around her.  She quickly pushed herself 
up as Slade came running toward her, straightening her back as she 
raised her arms defensively in front of her.  His right leg came up for 
a round house, and Terra leaped back onto her palms, back flipping out 
of the way.  As she came up to her feet again, she had to raise her 
right arm, blocking a left hook that would have taken her head right 
off, the man&#39;s power far greater than she expected.  

Her boots skidded back from the parried blow, and brought up a cross-arm 
block just as Slade&#39;s boot came crashing into her chest.  Terra was 
hurled backward onto her back, but with a quick twist of her legs, she 
managed to flip back, just as the metallic boots of the mercenary 
slammed into the very earth she had once laid upon.  With both arms 
cocked back, she hurled one forward, sending a mix of dirt and mud from 
the ground next to her right into the single eye of Slade.  As he 
attempted to wipe the grim from his face, she hurled another ball of 
much, forcing him off balance.  With a smirk, the blonde launched 
herself forward, letting loose a mixed flurry of punches and kicks, each 
one hitting their mark.

Her tiny fists crashed into his chest and face while a quick leap into 
the air sent a roundhouse kick to the side of his head.  Slade stumbled 
to one knee, and while she still spun she was able to use the same leg, 
as well as added momentum to deliver a second roundhouse, this one 
sending him crashing to the ground.  Terra took two leaps back while 
bringing her hands up above her head, surrounding them in a yellow hue.  
Just as the man finally freed his vision, he was forced to roll hastily 
to his side as a small portion of the ceiling fell, spiked pillars 
aiming to end his very life.  The race was now on, as Terra continued to 
rush herself backward, forcing more distance between herself and Slade 
as she hurled rock after rock toward the man, taking down portions of 
the ceiling and pieces of the wall, the environment around her a 
complete arsenal of unlimited ammo.

Slade continued to dodge his way out of falling rocks and impaling 
spikes.  Each attempt to get closer to the girl proved futile, as the 
ceiling would begin to cave in ten meters ahead of him.  He had trained 
the girl well, far too well.  He rolled forward, barely missing his body 
being crushed by a large bolder, and leaped to the right, just missing a 
baseball-sized rock that could have done some moderate damage.  He 
reached behind his back, pulling out his own arsenal of weaponry, and 
hurled three disks out in Terra&#39;s direction.  The blonde had become too 
cocky in her attacks to notice the disks, and they spiraled right into 
her, blowing up a portion of uplifted earth in front of her and threw 
her back, forcing her right into a pile of rocks.

Slade then came rushing over, spinning his metal staff around and 
leaping into the air, aiming to impale the girl right through her chest.  
Terra let out a quick gasp as her eyes widened, pressing her palms to 
the ground and allowing it to sink inward.  When Slade came crashing 
down with his attack, the ground had been replaced, and Terra&#39;s body was 
no where to be found.  As his head turned left and right, it was 
unprepared for the leather boot that came crashing into his temple, 
sending him flying toward the wall and forcing him to his knees.  Terra 
landed from her flying side kick and actually allowed the man to come up 
to a stand, wanting to look him in the eyes before she delivered the 
final blow.

Slade spun his body around much faster than Terra anticipated and hurled 
another disk outward, this one exploding a few meters in front of the 
girl.  There was a blinding white flash, so bright that it not only lit 
the entire cavern when it exploded, but forced the girl&#39;s pupils to 
become completely lost.  She closed her eyes immediately, rubbing them 
in an attempt to rid herself of the white light she still saw, the 
attack leaving her completely blind.  She felt a fist land heavily into 
her abdomen, forcing her to arch forward and let out a mix of air, 
saliva, and blood.  Her eyes went wide from the strike, and suddenly 
felt her hair roughly grabbed, her head forced down into Slade&#39;s knee.  
A sickening crunch sounded from the strike as it knocked her head back, 
blood erupting from her nose and lips while she attempted to regain her 
footing.

The mercenary now let loose his own flurry of punches, each one striking 
harder than the last and forcing her body back farther and farther.  A 
fist landed into her stomach, twice across her face, directly into her 
chest, and one right under her chin, an uppercut that knocked her into 
the air.  Slade circled his leg around and placed the heel of his foot 
into her chest and forced her to the ground.  He leaped up and cocked 
his right arm back, aiming to crush the girl&#39;s skull with his large 
fist.  Terra, knowing Slade&#39;s fighting style and sensing the final blow 
was about to come, let out a scream as she hurled her left arm across 
her chest, forcing a rather large portion of the wall to her side to 
come crashing across her, luckily smashing right into Slade and hurling 
him far across the cavern.  

Her lungs forced out a cough as she turned to her side in an attempt to 
push herself up.  Her vision was blurry, but the white screen was 
finally gone.  She felt dizzy, and her head felt as if it were about to 
either explode, or implode.  She couldn&#39;t help but let out a failed 
chuckle to the thought, not even able to determine what kind of pain she 
was in.  Slowly but surely, she was able to drag herself to her knees, 
her head hanging low while she heard her old trainer slowly getting to 
his feet as well, lifting her vision to view the man looking more 
furious than she had ever seen him.  The look was enough to not only 
please the elemental, but fuel her to continue her fight, and she too 
brought herself to her feet to lock herself in another melee round of 
hand-to-hand combat.



xXxXxXxXx



&quot;How&#39;s the operation going?&quot;  Raven asked as she straightened out her 
ruffled cloak through the mirror of her closet, fixing her hair and 
making herself look presentable.  It was as if the girl hadn&#39;t even 
broken down at all, like she only needed to vent and now she was 
completely back to normal.  Starfire stood next to the girl, still 
worried, but glad that Raven seemed normal.  She doubted that the girl 
was the same on the inside.

&quot;The construction workers arrived just as I came to see you,&quot; Starfire 
replied as she brushed a strand of hair that fell over her vision.  
&quot;Robin wanted me to see if you were alright, since you have not spoken a 
word since the attack.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m better now,&quot; Raven said as she looked herself in the mirror one 
more time.  Her eyes were tired, and dark markings circled them, making 
her look as tired as she felt.  Sighing reluctantly, she turned to face 
the girl, finally looking her in the eyes.  &quot;Thank you, Koriand&#39;r.&quot;

&quot;It is my pleasure, friend,&quot; Starfire nodded her head, though worry was 
still upon her face.  &quot;But are you certain you are alright?&quot;

&quot;I just needed to vent,&quot; Raven replied simply, turning toward the door.  
&quot;I&#39;m better now.&quot;

Starfire turned to follow her, but the sudden crunching from underneath 
her boots caught her attention.  The sound forced the sorceress to turn 
her head only a moment before she shrugged carelessly.

&quot;It must have happened during the attack,&quot; Raven said as she pressed her 
hand to the sensor next to her door, opening it once more.

&quot;I do not believe I remember seeing damage to your window,&quot; Starfire 
stated, remembering fighting the bots that had exited Raven&#39;s room.  
Upon further investigation, the Tamaran found the source of the 
destruction.  &quot;What is this?&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot;  Raven turned her head again, seeing Starfire crouching down next 
to her bed.  As Raven walked over curiously, she noticed Starfire 
holding a rock, with a folded piece of paper banded to it.  The 
sorceress&#39; eyes instantly widened, knowing good and well the source of 
its owner.  Before Starfire even had a chance to unfold the paper, it 
was snatched by Raven, and quickly skimmed.  The girl&#39;s fa&#135;ade shattered 
for the second time as she neared the end of the letter.  The girl&#39;s 
brows lowered while she crumpled it up in her grasp.  She then dropped 
the paper floor.  Raven&#39;s movements had been so fast, the paper hadn&#39;t 
even reached the carpet before the girl was gone.



xXxXxXxXx



Terra&#39;s head launched backward, as a powerful uppercut nailed her 
directly in the chin.  The strike forced her to slide a few feet back, 
but her stance didn&#39;t falter, and she quickly recovered in time to block 
a roundhouse kick that wound have taken her head right off.  She quickly 
dropped to the ground as her other arm raised to block a hook punch.  
She forced the arm back and used her other hand to deliver a quick jab 
to the mercenary&#39;s midsection, and followed up with another stronger 
punch, then an uppercut.  She landed two of the three punches, but it 
gave her time to take a breath before Slade came in for the offensive 
again.

Terra arched herself backward, barely missing another right hook and 
bright her knee up, only to be blocked by Slade&#39;s palm.  She stomped 
down with the same foot onto his own, and used the momentum to hurl 
herself into the air, spin her body around and deliver a devastating 
spinning roundhouse kick that would have knocked his head off.  
Unfortunately for the girl, the man was able to raise of his own, much 
stronger arm, grasping the girl&#39;s ankle fully and spinning her around.  
With a mighty throw, Terra was hurled across the room, but a quick 
motion of her hand launched a rock upward toward her feet.  With the 
ability to regain her composure, Terra placed her palm to the rock and 
brought herself high up into the air, her palm glowing brightly.

As Slade ran toward the girl, tiny particles of dust lifted at her 
command, spiraling around her and creating a sand storm, enough to blind 
the mercenary as he slowed his pace immensely and shielded his one eye.  
Several rocks were launched in his direction, each one smashing as they 
hit his chest, crossed arms and back, forcing him to crouch down in a 
defensive state.  Reaching into the back of his utility belt, Slade 
pulled out a small device, and created a smoke screen of his own, and 
disappeared from the blonde&#39;s view, silence for once falling over the 
arena.  As both dust clouds cleared, Terra stood upon her rock, high 
above the point of her summoned sandstorm, looking about for the lost 
mercenary.

A zipping sound from behind her caught Terra&#39;s attention, but by the 
time she turned, it was far too late.  Slade tackled the girl from above 
right off the rock she stood upon, hurling them both to the ground.  
They rolled several times, before Slade pinned the girl&#39;s arms up above 
her head with one of his hands, while delivering a strong punch across 
the side of her face.  Blood sprayed out from her mouth as the side of 
her face hit the canvas, sending her into a dazed state.  Slade reached 
for his belt again, while Terra&#39;s vision remained blurred from the 
strike.  As a sharp pain pricked the side of her neck, the mercenary 
slowly leaned over to whisper into her left ear.

&quot;I let you have your fun, apprentice,&quot; he stated in a low tone.  &quot;But 
playtime&#39;s over.&quot;



xXxXxXxXx



&quot;How are computer operations going?&quot;  Robin asked Cyborg as he took a 
break from ordering various construction workers around, rubbing the 
back of his neck while tucking the clip board under his arm.  It was 
fairly nice for the city to recognize the Titans as heroes and thus help 
them to rebuild their home incase of attacks, but for security reasons, 
Robin himself investigated each one, and only allowed up to ten people 
to help with the project, which really slowed things down.  Although 
Beast Boy stated Robin was beginning to sound paranoid, Robin said he&#39;d 
rather be safe and slow, than sorry and dead.  The changeling kept his 
mouth shut after that statement.

&quot;We&#39;ve got a new firewall set up, and I&#39;m inputting the new security 
password combination now,&quot; Cyborg announced while physically connected 
to the computer, as well as typing various keys upon an extended panel 
from the wall.  Robin nodded, then moved his hand from his neck to his 
shoulder, stretching his arm as he worked on his shoulder.  &quot;Why don&#39;t 
you take a break, man.  Me and B.B. can handle things from here.&quot;

On cue, there was a crash from below, to which several of the city&#39;s 
workers were yelling out the changeling&#39;s name.  Said teen then shouted 
out various apologies, and Robin merely sighed.

&quot;Well, I can handle things from here,&quot; Cyborg attempted to correct 
himself with a hesitant laugh.  &quot;I&#39;ll give him something to do that 
won&#39;t involve anything electronic.&quot;

&quot;Robin!&quot; 

The two titans turned instantly to the source of the voice.  Starfire 
came rushing into the room with a crumpled up piece of paper in one hand 
while her other arm flailed about.  The girl&#39;s face was stricken with 
worry as she flew directly to their teams leader.

&quot;Robin,&quot; the Tamaranian Princess shouted while she attempted to catch 
her breath.  &quot;Raven has ... Terra ... she1&quot;

Confused as he was, all his questions would be answered as Starfire 
passed him the very note that force Raven to fly form her living 
quarters.  His eyes focused upon the hard-to-read hand writing and read 
quietly to himself.  Beast Boy had instantly appeared by his leader&#39;s 
side.  The thought of his blonde-haired friend having dragged his 
attention from causing further frustration to the helpful construction 
workers.

Raven,

You said to me that once someone realizes they&#39;ve made a mistake, they 
are instantly forgiven as long as they are prepared to confront 
responsibility for their actions.  Well, I think I&#39;m finally able to 
face my demon.  I never had a place to call home until I met you and the 
rest of the Titans.  You all took me in and helped me out when I needed 
it.  But I was scared.  I&#39;ve always been scared, Raven.  I&#39;ve never had 
a place to call home before, because I&#39;m always afraid of messing things 
up.  Every time I get comfortable, I do something to make people force 
me to leave, most of the time because of my powers.  This time, however, 
it was because of my actions.  Raven, there&#39;s no way I can ever explain 
how truly sorry I am.  I realize now just how heartless Slade really is, 
and see now why you are always skeptical about who you trust.  I respect 
you so much more for it now, and I wish things could have been 
different.

The night I left the tower, I would give anything to have just listened 
to you and stay, but I can&#39;t turn back time.  There&#39;s nothing I can do 
to make up for what I&#39;ve done either, no matter how many times I 
apologize for it.  I put you, and your friends at risk.  I should have 
known better, but I truly believed in Slade&#39;s word, and thought for once 
that I could have a place to call home.  But now I realize that I&#39;ll 
never have a home.  I&#39;ll never be able to have a place to fit in because 
my powers are just too destructive.  So, what I&#39;m going to do now in 
hopes to atone for some of the damage I&#39;ve caused is to confront my true 
demon, Slade himself.

His base is located to the south of the city, near an old inactive 
volcano within the heart of the mountains.  I figure I have the upper 
hand, since he taught me everything he knows, and his entire base is 
surrounded by rock; my specialty.  I know I can&#39;t ask for your 
forgiveness, and I know things will never be the same between us.  
Instead, I&#39;m going to take out this monster once and for all, and if 
everything goes accordingly ... well, let&#39;s just say you wont have 
anymore headaches from me.

Before I go to fight, I just wanted to let you know just how I feel 
about you Raven.  The time we shared together may have been short, but I 
think I got to know more about you than anyone else in the tower, 
besides Starfire.  But the night on the rooftop of the tower, I think we 
really connected with one another.  You showed me a side of you that I 
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen you show to anyone, Raven, and it touched me 
more than I even realized at that point.  I just wish I had the courage 
to have acted on my emotions.  I know it&#39;s hard for you because your 
emotions are connected to your powers, but bottling them up inside isn&#39;t 
always good either.  Eventually, you might explode, and I fear that from 
you.

Wow, this is my seventh attempt at writing this letter because I didn&#39;t 
want it to be so long, but once again I find myself writing more than I 
expected.  Raven, I&#39;m really so very sorry for what I&#39;ve done to you, 
and your friends.  I know you said to me that I don&#39;t have anymore 
friends, and I believe you ... but you&#39;ll always be the closest thing to 
me.  I was never able to connect with someone like I did with you that 
night, and I hope that things go a lot better for you than they have for 
me.  Please, don&#39;t come for me, because I know the hero inside of you 
would, no matter what I&#39;ve done in the past.  I must face him by myself.  
I just want all this pain to end ... I just want it all to end.  I just 
can&#39;t stand to be hated by someone that ... that I really truly liked.

~Terra

P.S.  I&#39;m sorry to have to break your window, but I can&#39;t deliver this 
personally.

Toward the bottom of the message, there were several erase marks, 
especially toward the last two sentences.  Robin had skimmed through the 
long letter rather fast, skipping over the more private parts of it and 
straight to the parts speaking of Slade.  Slade&#39;s hideout, Robin had the 
location.  His eyes turned up to the worried look of Starfire in an 
instant, while he crumpled up the paper in his fist.  His blood boiled 
to the thought that the girl would face the menace alone, knowing good 
and well just how powerful Slade truly was.  He also knew the 
relationship his teammates had with Terra, for she was the reason the 
city&#39;s construction workers were working around the clock to repair 
their home.

&quot;What did it say?&quot;  Beast Boy asked, having only read two or three lines 
in before Robin lowered the letter.  His brows lowered in concentration, 
already knowing the thought of Starfire.

&quot;Terra went to go fight Slade alone,&quot; Robin relayed, deciding to keep 
the rest in his own mind.  Beast Boy didn&#39;t need to know anything else 
in the letter.

&quot;She what?&quot;  Beast Boy threw his hands out, while he became as worry 
struck as Starfire.  &quot;We gotta go help her!&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;s the enemy,&quot; Cyborg announced, though his voice was lacking.  
It was apparent he too was worried for his former teammate.

&quot;I think Raven went to help Terra,&quot; Starfire announced unsteadily, as 
she rubbed her upper arm with her other hand.  Robin&#39;s eyes lowered as 
he stared at the crumpled up piece of paper in his hand.  His fingers 
curled up into a tightly balled up fist, now knowing the response his 
teammates were looking for.

&quot;Titans, Go!&quot;

&quot;This is quite amazing, Tara,&quot; a sharp voice interrupted her attempted 
slumber.  Through the fog, the blonde fought, until a bright light 
flashed from above her.  Her half opened eyes squinted in an attempt to 
see, her mind a long haze and vision completely blurred.  Her body felt 
like dead weight, as if her blood had been pumped with liquid lead.  
&quot;You hold a unique power, but you don&#39;t have the correct chromosome in 
your body.  Normal Meta-Humans have a unique chromosome that&#39;s different 
than normal human beings, but all of yours are completely normal.&quot;

Terra had no idea what the man was talking about, but it sounded oddly 
familiar.  It hurt too much to think about it.  Her body ached from the 
previous fight, and her muscles wouldn&#39;t obey any command her brain gave 
them.  She felt something cold entering into her arms, and her heart 
race in fear.

&quot;What ... what are you doing to me?&quot;  Terra&#39;s fear was evident in her 
shaken voice, her blurred vision and inability to lift her head left her 
completely in the dark to the actions of the mercenary.  Slade merely 
grinned as he leaned over the girl&#39;s face, upside down to her current 
position.

&quot;Studying you like the insect you are,&quot; he said without emotion, while 
his hands moved with some sort of blurry metallic object toward her 
neck.  She felt a sting, similar to the one she had felt earlier, and 
soon her vision turned black again.  This was it, all her attempts to 
fight against him were for nothing.  Her own fight against her inner 
demons she had lost against, and she had failed herself.  Not only that, 
but she had failed Raven, and her once called teammates.  She had 
promised that she would end Slade&#39;s terror, and only helped him in 
achieving his ultimate goal; control of her powers.  His voice was the 
last thing she heard before her effort to actually fight slumber faded.  
&quot;And taking what&#39;s rightfully mine.&quot;

The shadows of the room collected together in a swirling of black 
energy, forming a large enough circle for the sorceress to fit her body 
through.  The black energy dispersed as Raven pulled back the hood to 
her cloak.  Azure leather boots touched the surface of the dirt flooring 
while the lights flickered due to an energy surge.  Raven&#39;s focused was 
placed forward as her senses stretched out in search of the Earth 
element.  Her emotions were restless, and her attempts to keep them calm 
had all failed.  Her mission remained the same, however, despite the 
arguments in her mind.  Terra, as much as she disliked to say it, had to 
be helped.  There was no way she would hold up against Slade even if the 
girl was able to fully control her powers.  Even with the entire Titan&#39;s 
team against him, he had escaped on numerous occasions.  With an endless 
supply of robot armies at his fingertips, Raven had begun to fear the 
worst when she had first received the letter in her room.

Her eyes easily adjusted to the darkness once the four light bulbs in 
the room simultaneously shattered, one of the many traits inherited by 
her father&#39;s blood.  She cautiously made her way forward, watching out 
for any sort of trap.  She wasn&#39;t too sure she could trust the girl&#39;s 
words, but they had struck something inside of the emotionless mage that 
she had once thought to have been lost.  There was also the fact that 
she had stated not to follow her that told the girl that she was in fact 
telling the truth.  The guilt Raven had felt during the past few days 
had forced her to fly blindly to Slade&#39;s hideout, without the help of 
her teammates.  Now more than ever she had wished they were with her as 
she walked down the darkened hallway.  Stupidly, she had left her 
communicator back at the tower in her room.

Her hands were stretched outward as the walls began to narrow, and 
followed the pathway to a large metal door that seemed far too likely to 
be apart of the cave structure.  Her eyes narrowed as her senses picked 
up two life forms deeper within the cave beyond this doorway.  Her 
breathing intensified beyond her control, and her heart raced along with 
it.  She couldn&#39;t describe the feeling welling up inside of her, but her 
adrenaline rushed beyond her control.  Her hands pressed against the 
cold surface, and concentrated her energy against it.  Her fingertips 
sparked a small amount of black energy, and once again she was able to 
open up a portal that would bring her to the other side of the doorway.  
She collected herself within the shadows of her own energy, and passed 
straight through the door to the other side.

Her legs were first to pass through, along with her arms and the rest of 
her body to follow.  As her head was forced through the solid metal and 
appeared on the other side, she was unprepared for what she was about to 
encounter.  Slade&#39;s entire hand gripped the girl&#39;s face and lifted her 
into the air.  His arm wound back and forced the back of her head to 
slam against the metal door which sent the sorceress into a daze.  Stars 
greeted Raven&#39;s vision after everything went black, her vocal cords 
announcing a rather groggy groan to the unexpected strike.  He slammed 
her against it again, then again before he hurled her forward across the 
dirt flooring.  Raven skidded to a stop several meters from the 
mercenary, coughing up the dirt that picked up all around her and 
attempted to push herself up.

&quot;Slade,&quot; she spat out in a distaste that seemed to make her blood boil 
in rage.  This was the man that Terra had chosen over her to teach her?  
Her teeth grinded against one another as her jaw clenched tightly shut, 
her rage just begging to take control at this point.  She could almost 
sense the smirk behind the man&#39;s one-eyed mask as his eyes lowered upon 
her.  She stood up without brushing the dirt from her leotard and cloak, 
glaring hatefully to the creature before her.  To her, this man held no 
humanity in him and was a mere beast hiding within a human form.  He&#39;ll 
pay for his crimes with...

&quot;We&#39;ve been expecting you,&quot; Slade announced, interrupting the dark 
mage&#39;s thoughts as he extended his arm outward while the other folded 
behind his back.  His outstretched arm pointed to Raven&#39;s right side, 
and she turned to see a source of light that hovered over a metal plate.  
Her eyes widened as the plate began to tilt vertically, a frail human 
girl strapped to it with a metal contraption throughout her body, 
seeming like armor at a first glance.  Raven knew better than to just 
judge the attire based on its looks, focusing upon the two plates that 
were stuck to the blonde&#39;s skull.  &quot;I&#39;m rather disappointed that you are 
the only one to show up, but it&#39;s to be expected ... especially with my 
apprentices&#39; choice of actions as of late.&quot;

&quot;Terra,&quot; Raven gaped to the unconscious girl strapped to the bed, then 
turned hatefully toward the man with an extending of her own arm.  &quot;What 
the hell did you do to her?&quot;&quot;

&quot;I only did what I felt necessary,&quot; Slade announced with a casual roll 
of his hand, completely unfazed by Raven&#39;s anger.  &quot;The girl wanted to 
leave without paying her debt to me.&quot;

&quot;Debt?&quot;  Raven&#39;s voice questioned aloud on its own accord.  Slade&#39;s eyes 
then lowered as they focused from the sorceress to the blonde.  He 
lifted the folded arm behind his back which revealed a newly acquired 
bracelet.  He pressed a button that forced the blonde&#39;s eyes to open to 
reveal a pool of sapphire completely void of life.  Her pupils were 
contracted to the point that it seemed they weren&#39;t even there, and her 
face was lost of all emotion.

&quot;Complete control of her powers.&quot;
