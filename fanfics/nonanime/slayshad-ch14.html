<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Willow looked down at the soundly sleeping Buffy,
stroking the dirty blonde hair gently from her face.
&#39;She&#39;s lovely,&#39; she mused once again before quietly
slipping from the bed. With her incredible night
vision Willow carefully picked up her clothes,
dressing in her leather dress smoothly before the
redheaded vampire quietly slipped from the bedroom.

The other bedroom was equally quiet as Dawn slept
soundly, the brown haired young girl curled up in the
bed. Willow silently moved through the house to the
kitchen, setting up the coffee pot for when Buffy
awoke then headed outside, locking the door behind
her.

The air had a bitter chill to it, the seasons
gradually shifting towards winter. It was Halloween,
one of the few nights where the creatures of the
supernatural rarely ventured out. Giles had given
Buffy the day off and they had taken full advantage of
the quiet. Of course that didn&#39;t mean that other
things couldn&#39;t happen...

Willow moved through town, the streets utterly silent
as her black leather coat swirled around her. Once
upon a time the streets would have been filled with
kids, dressed in costume and running from door to door
with bags open for candy, but the years spent under
the Masters cruel rule had stopped that. Kids might be
getting some candy from their parents, maybe, but that
would be all.

The lights were still on at the Bronze, a few people
still scattered around the building. Willow was
tempted to go inside a moment but she wasn&#39;t sure she
was up to dealing with Tara&#39;s cold shoulder tonight.
&#39;Besides,&#39; Willow smiled to herself, &#39;I saw the way
Faith and Tara were together earlier. I wonder if
anything is going to happen?&#39;

Moving on she soon reached the odd familiarity of the
cemetery, Willow casually leaping up over the fence
onto the soft soil. She didn&#39;t really expect there to
be any vampires rising tonight, the timing of any
recent attacks wasn&#39;t right, but she wasn&#39;t taking any
chances. The paths between the graves were well
tended, the statues and tombstones gleamed from
careful care. She felt him coming, despite his quiet
and wasn&#39;t surprised when he spoke up.

&quot;Rosenberg,&quot; Old man Snyder nodded to her curtly, the
bald man leaning on his shovel. Once the principal of
Sunnydale High he had lost so much when the Master
took over the city, barely escaping the first attacks
with his life. Oddly the once cowardly man had found
himself helping Giles&#39; vampire slayers, resigning to
take up his position here to stand watch over the
dead.

&quot;Quiet night?&quot; Willow asked.

&quot;Of course,&quot; he said witheringly. Snyder shook his
head, &quot;You should be at home resting up for whatever
comes tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Willow smiled wryly, &quot;but there&#39;s some
people I wanted to pay my respects to.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Snyder shrugged, &quot;just don&#39;t make a mess.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Willow said as she moved on.

The route Willow walked was one that she remembered
well, careful not to disturb flowers resting on plots,
the tributes left by the living to the remembered
dead. Finally she came to a stop in front of matching
gravestones, each bearing the same last name as hers.

Willow took a deep breath and said, &quot;Mother, Father,
it&#39;s been a while.&quot; She sat down there on the grass,
tucking the cloth beneath her legs as she tried to
find the right words. &#39;Just like when they were
alive,&#39; she thought with an edge of bitterness, &#39;it
was never easy to talk to them then, so why should it
be easy now?&#39;

&quot;I guess I just wanted to tell you I found someone,&quot;
Willow said softly. She smiled to herself fondly,
&quot;Buffy&#39;s.. a bit different, but I think you&#39;d like
her. We compliment each other pretty well.&quot;

She could just imagine their comments on her being gay
and Willow shook her head. Her parents had been
liberal, of a sort, saying all the right things and
believing in all the right causes. They were both
intellectuals, reading from the best parenting books
and following their guidance but showing warmth... or
even some sincerity had been a bit lacking.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you.&quot; Willow got up, brushing her legs off.
She turned and headed off into the darkness, knowing
that there was someone else that she needed to visit.
The graves over here were a bit less well kept up,
mostly because there were no bodies, just markers to
remind people that they had once existed. They were
vampires who had been dusted, no bodies left for
burial and often no family members left to remember
them by.

&#39;A lot like me,&#39; Willow thought grimly as she looked
at the name on one of the stones. &#39;Alexander Harris&#39;
and a pair of dates were etched in stone, then just
below that had been added the date he had been dusted
in the final battle with the Master a few months ago.

&quot;Happy Halloween, Wills,&quot; the young man&#39;s voice said
from behind her.

&quot;You&#39;re just a product of my imagination,&quot; Willow
looked over to where the brown haired young man
casually perched on a tombstone, &quot;Xander.&quot;

&quot;You guys did a pretty good job on the tombstone,&quot;
Xander nodded to it, the spirit smiling wryly as he
added, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Willow sighed.

She had first seen the ghost standing in the cemetery
just a few weeks ago, and had originally chalked it up
to a guilty mind. Still, she had ventured back a few
times, trying to find out what it was she had seen.
There was no sense of dark supernatural forces, no
evil magic or threat and eventually she had made
contact with him.

&quot;So how&#39;s the vampire slaying going?&quot; Xander asked
curiously.

Willow shrugged, &quot;They were pretty disorganized at
first, broken into roving gangs. We did a lot of
damage but now they seem to be getting organized.&quot;

&quot;A new master vamp?&quot; Xander offered.

&quot;No one&#39;s saying anything,&quot; Willow said as she leaned
up against another tombstone, &quot;so there&#39;s no way to be
sure.&quot;

&quot;Well, make sure to watch your back,&quot; Xander said to
her firmly, &quot;I don&#39;t want more of your company that
badly.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Willow grinned.

Xander looked over at her with a impish little smile,
&quot;So who&#39;s the pretty blonde I&#39;ve been seeing you
with?&quot;

Willow could actually feel herself blush a little as
she said, &quot;She&#39;s my girlfriend, Buffy.&quot;:

Xander broke into a grin, &quot;Too bad I&#39;m not still
alive, I&#39;d compete with you for her.&quot;

Willow just shook her head, &quot;I think I&#39;m keeping her
very happy, thanks.&quot; She tilted her head back, &quot;The
only complication has been her little sister showing
up.&quot;

&quot;Puts a bit of a crimp in ravaging your girlfriend in
front of the fireplace,&quot; Xander remarked. He saw the
blush steal across Willow&#39;s face and laughed, &quot;You
did!&quot;

&quot;Xander!&quot; Willow scolded.

Xander just laughed evilly at the look on her face. He
looked at her thoughtfully, &quot;So are you two planning
on making this... more permanent?&quot;

Willow looked off into the distance uncomfortably. &quot;I
haven&#39;t asked,&quot; she said, &quot;and I&#39;m not all that sure
how Buffy would respond.&quot;

Xander smiled, &quot;From how I saw her looking at you, I
don&#39;t think she&#39;d mind.&quot; He seemed to fade a little as
he continued, &quot;If you don&#39;t ask, you&#39;ll never know.&quot;

Xander continued to fade away as Willow quickly said,
&quot;See you later.&quot; In only a moment the young man was
gone, leaving only a chill in the air in his wake.

Quietly Willow slipped away from the graveyard,
sensing that sunrise wasn&#39;t all that far away. No one
was outside, the city dead silent as she cut through
town then out to the formerly abandoned mansion that
had become their home. She looked in on Dawn once
again then went into the bedroom that she and Buffy
shared.

&quot;You&#39;re cold,&quot; Buffy murmured, cuddling close as
Willow climbed into bed beside her. Sleepily she
asked, &quot;Where did you go?&quot;

Willow pulled Buffy close, smelling the lovely scent
that she gave off. &quot;Just talking to an old friend,&quot;
she answered.

&quot;Maybe you&#39;ll introduce me,&quot; Buffy murmured.

Willow smiled, &quot;Maybe.&quot; They lay there as Willow tried
to make her mouth move, to ask the question that
Xander suggested, but she couldn&#39;t seem to manage it.

Buffy snored softly and Willow sighed. Buffy had
fallen back asleep. With a smile she cuddled to Buffy
even as Willow murmured to herself, &quot;Next time.&quot;</pre>
