<h1>Outside In (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It started a few months ago.  Nothing was out of the ordinary, really.  
She and Ron would get called out on missions, and many of them involved 
Dr. Drakken and his outlandish plans for world domination.  It was 
normal.  Drakken would explain his plans and demand that Shego attack 
her with everything she had while he tried to run.  Ron would attend to 
this, usually by wresting the stolen goods from Drakken&#39;s hands or by 
making sure he didn&#39;t press the button to his ill-conceived doomsday 
device.  All of that was normal.

Fighting Shego was where things became strange.  When their green eyes 
met, something panged.  A twinge ran swiftly in and out of her chest-a 
feeling?  With every blow that was blocked and their eyes alighted on 
the other&#39;s, the twinge happened.  Then it grew to encompass every 
passing glance, every bare touch.  It soon became an almost constant 
ache; a throb that intensified as the simple thought of Shego entered 
her mind.

A month ago, she suddenly remembered what the twinge was-why it hurt so 
much more when Shego landed a blow.  That twinge was something she had 
felt two years ago when she was sixteen.  She had felt a pulling in her 
chest when she saw Josh Mankey-a weaker feeling than the throbbing she 
felt now, but it was the same kind of feeling.  Once she realized this, 
she tried even harder to defeat Shego.  She wanted to drive the thought 
of her enemy from her mind, to forget that she was in love.

So many nights were spent without sleep while she thought.  What was the 
reason this was happening, she wondered night after night.  Why was she 
falling in love with Shego?  Could she think of any reasons?  She tried 
not to think of them in her efforts to forget, but they were seared in 
her thoughts and her memories.  Shego was strong and confident for one.  
She had always looked for that in a person, even if she was just looking 
for someone to be friends with.  Ron was strong in spirit and confident 
most of the time, just as Wade was.

But Shego was different than them somehow.  She was far more intelligent 
than she led many to believe, considering that she worked for Dr. 
Drakken.  And-even though she didn&#39;t want to think like this-Shego was 
just as alluring as she always flaunted to be.  But why was she suddenly 
thinking of Shego like this?  Shego had never given her any reason for 
her to fall in love with the inky-haired woman.

Shego had only been Shego in all of the years that she had known her-and 
maybe that was why she had fallen in love.  She had been drawn in by the 
truth that Shego was not afraid to hide.  It was just the opposite of 
how she was and exactly how she wished she could be.  That was really 
the reason.  All the admiration she felt for Shego and her brazen 
attitude had deepened further than she would have thought possible.  And 
yet...wasn&#39;t anything possible for a Possible?

----------

She wondered why she always had to do everything the hard way.  She 
could see that Kim was feeling those strange jerks in her chest at the 
meeting of their eyes.  She could feel that Kim was doubling her 
efforts, trying to defeat her to push her from her mind.  She had never 
had so many bruised bones in her life.

The only reason she was so battered was because she would neither fight 
back with the same abandon that Kim used, but nor would she accept 
defeat.  She knew that they had fallen in love with each other and Kim 
was desperately trying to ignore that.  What was the point of that, 
though?  She wasn&#39;t going to ignore being in love with Kim.  It was 
undeniable.  Kim overwhelmed her thoughts.  She had agreed to the most 
juvenile and idiotic schemes that Drakken could come up with simply to 
see Kim.

You&#39;d have to be blind, she always thought, to not see how it was 
impossible to resist Kim.  She was smart, headstrong, and more than able 
to hold her own, not to mention she was a very lovely young lady.  
Fighting against her, learning everything about her to try and defeat 
her-Kim was an integral part of her life.  She couldn&#39;t do anything but 
fall in love with her.  Because of that, she schemed.

----------

The moon wasn&#39;t full, but it was bright enough to paint the ground 
white.  Kim Possible ran as quietly as she could, turning sharply into 
an alleyway.  She glanced out of the alleyway, her breath coming faster 
than was necessary.

&quot;&#39;Go to Middleton Park at one-fifteen tonight&#39;,&quot; she thought.  &quot;&#39;Make 
sure you aren&#39;t followed.&#39;  That&#39;s what the message said.  But...why did 
I get e-mail from Shego?  Is this a trap? It must be-if it isn&#39;t, that 
what is it?  Could she know?  That can&#39;t be it.  No one knows.  No one 
can know.&quot;  The thoughts still repeating in a loop, Kim set out from the 
alleyway again.  She reached the park and looked at her watch.  It was 
one-fifteen.  She glanced about and found no one.

&quot;Shego!&quot; she called out.  &quot;Where are you?  What is this about?&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t shout so much, Kimmy,&quot; Shego said softly, leaping lightly 
from the tree Kim stood near.  She looked up towards the waning 
half-moon, her arms crossed under her chest.  &quot;It is one in the 
morning.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the one who e-mailed me,&quot; Kim snapped.  &quot;You told me to come 
here at one-fifteen alone, so I&#39;m here.  The question is, why did you 
call me here?&quot;  Shego looked down from the moon and met Kim&#39;s eyes.  
Kim&#39;s hands twitched and her breath caught, but she managed to not break 
the gaze.  Shego took a step towards the red-haired young woman; Kim 
took a step back.  They repeated this until Kim had been backed against 
a tree.

Kim raised her hands in a stance, but Shego pushed them back to the 
other woman&#39;s sides.  The prolonged contact sent sparks across Kim&#39;s 
neck and down her back.  She hoped that Shego, who was still holding her 
hands, wouldn&#39;t notice the goosebumps rising on her skin.  Shego leaned 
closer, as if drawing close for a kiss.

&quot;Are you in love with me, Kim?&quot; she asked.  Kim felt the blush cover her 
neck and face.

&quot;What?&quot; she sputtered, trying to throw a disgusted tone into her voice 
and failing miserably.  &quot;What are you-how could you think-no!&quot;  Shego 
laughed, and the huskiness of the sound made Kim want to kiss her then 
and there.

&quot;You know, you&#39;re cute when you blush like that,&quot; Shego chuckled.  &quot;That 
just shows me that you are in love with me.&quot;

&quot;Why are you here?&quot; Kim demanded.  &quot;Are you trying to mess with my head 
so I won&#39;t be able to fight you?&quot;

&quot;Well, a little bit,&quot; Shego said rather thoughtfully.  &quot;But I&#39;m mostly 
here to seduce you so I can tell you that I&#39;m in love with you after we 
have wild, passionate sex.&quot;  The blush on Kim&#39;s face matched her hair.  
She stuttered wildly for a few minutes more before realizing what Shego 
had said.

&quot;You love me?&quot; she asked, thoroughly bewildered.

&quot;Did I say that?&quot; Shego murmured.  &quot;Hmm.  I can&#39;t say I&#39;m lying.&quot;  Her 
hands lifted from Kim&#39;s wrists and were laid upon the young woman&#39;s 
cheeks.  She leaned in, but Kim met her halfway.  They remained locked 
in that kiss for a good thirty seconds before pulling away.  Green eyes 
met green eyes; staring longingly into each other for many minutes.

&quot;You do know that I&#39;m not going to stop being evil just because we&#39;re 
going to get to know each other a little more intimately,&quot; Shego said, a 
somewhat lecherous grin on her face.

&quot;I already guessed that,&quot; Kim replied.  &quot;But just because we&#39;re 
girlfriends doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to take it easy on you when Drakken 
makes you work on another dumb scheme for world domination.&quot;

&quot;Once I have enough money to retire young and beautiful, I&#39;m throwing 
him to the guards at a state penitentiary.  He won&#39;t be able to escape 
without me.  But you can&#39;t expect anyone to be able to hold me in a 
prison.  You should tell that to the police one day.&quot;

&quot;I will.  Listen, I think I should get home before we get too caught up 
in things.&quot;

&quot;Who said that&#39;s a bad thing?&quot;

----------

It was six in the morning when Kim got home.  The sun was only beginning 
to peak when she managed to slip back into her bedroom through the 
window.  Her lips were slightly bruised and her hair was mussed.  
Despite this, she crawled back into bed with a pleased smile and the 
world off of her shoulders.

----------

Shego sat on the edge of the roof of Drakken&#39;s latest lair, her legs 
crossed and one foot kicking as she hummed a soft tune.  A smile crossed 
her faintly bruised lips as the sun rose up and shone down upon 
Middleton.  For that moment-that brief, shining moment-the sun reflected 
the bright and glittering peace that love gave to the world.  Once the 
sun had crested and the fantastic flare of light that accompanied it had 
failed, that moment was gone.
