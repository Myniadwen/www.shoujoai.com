Captain Maggie Sawyer smiled slightly as the brown haired woman nodded 
hello to the secretaries and officers just finishing up the day shift. 
She strode to her office and sat down behind her desk, already 
considering the night&#39;s tasks. &quot;Stacy,&quot; she called, &quot;had any luck 
reaching Montoya?&quot;

Stacy leaned on the doorway as the administrative assistant sighed. &quot;For 
a detective,&quot; she said, &quot;Renee&#39;s pretty bad about picking up our 
messages.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;Or she&#39;s dodging you.&quot;

Maggie made a face at that, but she couldn&#39;t disagree. After Renee left 
the force Maggie had done her best to reach out to her, seeing her 
falling into a spiral of drinking and anger. But something, what Maggie 
didn&#39;t know, had pulled Renee out of that spiral and she now was 
operating as a private eye.

&quot;Keep trying,&quot; Maggie said. She looked thoughtful, &quot;I heard a rumor she 
was seeing Kate Kane... can you look into it?&quot;

&quot;Our Renee and a socialite?&quot; Stacy raised her eyebrows. &quot;Will do!&quot;

Maggie smiled as she shook her head, watching through the window as her 
officers filed in. With Commissioner Gordon back in charge they were 
getting much better support from city hall and morale was generally 
pretty high. The regular assistance of costumed vigilantes was also 
helping, though Maggie was of mixed feelings about that.

On one hand, back when Maggie had served in Metropolis she had worked 
closely with Superman, even following his lead in several crises. But 
unlike the Batman she had found Superman reasonably open, willing to 
share information and assist in building cases. Batman and his allies, 
on the other hand, were largely secretive and covert, rarely sticking 
around to help cops make cases to prosecute their foes.

&#39;Of course, I&#39;m also under orders from Gordon to cooperate, so I guess 
I&#39;m stuck,&#39; Maggie admitted to herself as she got up to get some coffee.

&quot;Evening Captain,&quot; Ellen Yin nodded, the rookie dropping off papers for 
several of the night shifters. The black haired young woman was a very 
good patrol officer with potential and Maggie had resolved to try to 
help her wherever she could.

Maggie picked up the pot and looked skeptically at the brown fluid, &quot;How 
old is this?&quot;

David Cornwell shrugged as the night shifter said, &quot;To be honest I just 
nuked my cup and chewed it.&quot;

&quot;Ugh,&quot; Maggie poured the gunk out and made more.

Harvey Bullock was a big, bulky man, his expression dour and suspicious. 
Since his return to the force alongside Gordon he had operated carefully 
within the rules, but Maggie still didn&#39;t trust him. In her experience a 
copper who crossed the line and killed a criminal, no matter how 
justified, would do it again.

&quot;Harv,&quot; Maggie said as she passed his desk, &quot;you busy?&quot;

&quot;Not too busy for you,&quot; Harvey answered, getting to his feet and 
following her in.

Maggie sat down behind her desk, hiding her distaste. &quot;You&#39;ve been doing 
good work clearing cases lately,&quot; she said.

&quot;Thnks,&quot; Harvey said a bit warily.

Flashing a smile Maggie said, &quot;As you know, the only reward for good 
work is more work.&quot; As Harvey smiled back reluctantly she asked, &quot;You&#39;ve 
met Yin?&quot;

&quot;Apple polisher,&quot; Harvey answered automatically, &quot;but a good kid.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like you to partner with her,&quot; Maggie admitted. &quot;She&#39;s taking the 
detective exam but is pretty damn green in Gotham. I want you to help 
her get used to the city and the sort of players she&#39;ll have to deal 
with.&quot;

&quot;Can do,&quot; Harvey surprised her with a smile, &quot;kinda reminds me of when I 
worked with Renee back in the day.&quot;

Maggie nodded, &quot;Exactly my thought.&quot; As she handed him a edited version 
of Yin&#39;s file she asked, &quot;Have you heard from Renee?&quot;

Harvey shook his head regretfully, &quot;She still bears a grudge over... all 
the stuff from when I was last a cop.&quot; He sighed, &quot;I&#39;m hoping I can get 
through to her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to get her back on the force,&quot; Maggie admitted.

Again Harvey surprised her, this time shaking his had no as she firmly 
said, &quot;No, it ain&#39;t gonna happen.&quot;

Maggie gave him a frown, &quot;Oh?&quot;

Harvey met her eyes calmly, &quot;Mags, her partner was killed by a fellow 
cop. Well, a CSI, but you know what I mean.&quot; As Maggie reluctantly 
nodded he added, &quot;And then he got away with it. No wonder she feels 
betrayed.&quot;

&quot;All true,&quot; Maggie conceded with a sigh. Of Course, Corrigan had been 
shot but not by a lawman, instead the son of Renee&#39;s partner had to fo 
it. It was something that still haunted Maggie, their one great failure. 
She met his eyes as she added, &quot;It happened on my watch, too.&quot;

Harvey said gently, &quot;She don&#39;t blame you, Cap&#39;n.&#39;

Maggie shrugged slightly, &quot;I blame myself.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Commissioner James Gordon stood on the roof, contemplating the 
Bat-signal. It had become a trusted friend and occasional publicity 
problem to the Gotham City Police Department down through the years. 
Still, he knew it was good to have, especially in a crisis.

&quot;You haven&#39;t turned it on,&quot; the voice came out of the shadows as Gordon 
nearly jumped in surprise. He recognized the voice itself, of course, 
and looking around he saw those eerie white eyes staring out of the 
darkness,

James took out his pipe, more out of practice than any need to smoke. 
&quot;Not needed yet. It&#39;s been a fairly quiet night so far,&quot; he remarked.

&quot;So far,&quot; Batman said in his usual growl.&quot;Did that tip I gave I gave you 
on the new Ventriloquist bear out?&quot;

&quot;Caught a fair number of her goons,:&quot; James sounded a bit annoyed, :&quot;but 
she got away from us again with those damn exploding dummies of hers.&quot;

&quot;Reily is getting more wily,&quot; Batman admitted grumpily, &quot;I&#39;m going to 
have to concentrate on bringing her down.&quot;

James gave him a curious look, &quot;With the other adventurers appearing in 
Gotham, I&#39;d expect you to have more time available.&quot;

A slight smile appeared on the shadowed figure&#39;s face as he said, &quot;No 
matter how many of us there are, there never seems to be enough.&quot;

:True,&quot; Gordon conceded, knowing how adding cops never seemed to make a 
dent in the city&#39;s crime rate. He looked rather sheepish, &quot;There was 
something I was going to ask you....&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Batman tilted his head to the side questioningly.

&quot;It&#39;s Oracle,&quot; James shrugged slightly, &quot;could you remind her to stay 
under my radar, please?&quot;

Batman hid a slight smile. &quot;Why can&#39;t you tell her yourself?&quot; he asked 
even though he suspected why.

James sighed, &quot;I&#39;m trying not to officially acknowledge her existence. I 
found out about Oracle when I was retired, so officially I don&#39;t have to 
concede she exists.&quot;

Batman chuckled, &quot;I&#39;ll pass the message along.&quot;

&quot;It was easier when I was just pretending I didn&#39;t know she was 
Batgirl,&quot; James sighed, scratching at his thinning hair.

&quot;I&#39;d best get going,&quot; Batman moved into the light a moment then was 
gone, &quot;good luck.&quot;

&quot;You too,&quot; James smiled before heading to the rood door and going 
downstairs.

The route to his office was slowed by officers greeting him, warm 
expressions of trust and friendship. The Gotham PD had missed Gordon 
while he was gone, and much of the rank and file still wanted to offer 
their greetings or welcome him back. Well, everyone but the corrupt cops 
Gordon had swiftly uprooted on his return, in part deposing the current 
commissioner at the time.

&#39;Poor Atkins,&#39; Gordon mused, &#39;but when you&#39;re the man in the hot seat 
you can&#39;t claim ignorance. If you didn&#39;t know, you should have.&#39;

A familiar looking woman lounged by the door to his office, resembling 
one of many cops waiting to talk to the boss. But this red-brown haired 
woman was no longer a cop, and her rare appearances tended to brighten 
Gordon&#39;s day.

&quot;Renee!&quot; Gordon smiled, picking up the pace to reach the younger woman&#39;s 
side, &quot;come in, come in.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Renee Montoya agreed as she followed Gordon inside. She 
reached into her overcoat and produced a computer disk, &quot;Here&#39;s the 
surveilance on Officer Rebecca Mulcahey you asked for.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the news?&quot; Gordon asked, bracing himself a bit when he saw 
Renee&#39;s tense expression.

Reluctantly Renee said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Jim. She&#39;s still dirty.&quot; Reaching 
out to tap the disk she said, &quot;I&#39;ve got her on film taking bribes and 
returning evidence to criminals.&quot;

James Gordon winced visibly, &quot;The missing cocaine?&quot;

&quot;You got it,&quot; Renee nodded. &quot;I&#39;m not sure my files are useable in court, 
considering my bias towards her, but it should be enough to open a 
investigation.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pass it on to internal affairs,&quot; he agreed. James gave her a 
thoughtful look as he tried again, &quot;We could really use you back on the 
force....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m already dodging Maggie&#39;s calls,&quot; Renee rolled her eyes, &quot;don&#39;t make 
me start with you, too.&quot; Giving him a wry smile she added, &quot;I think I&#39;m 
doing about as well as could be expected going private, and besides who 
else could you hire to look into your bad apples off the books?&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; James agreed. He leaned forward, &quot;I guess I just miss 
having you around.&quot;

Renee gave him a surprisingly gentle smile, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not in a hurry. 
Catch me up on the gossip and I&#39;ll let drop a few interesting names in 
the circles I move in too.&quot;</pre>
