<h1>The Excalibur Alternative (part 6 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        Pete Wisdom smiled to himself slightly as the black haired 
Englishman lead the group of his old and new teammates through what he 
had come to think of as the Excalibur wing of the Muir Island Research 
station.

        &quot;We&#39;ve got suites to sleep everybody comfortably,&quot; Pete gestured 
to one section as they passed it then added, &quot;up ahead the Prof. and 
Hank McCoy got a version of the original Cerebro system set up here.&quot;

        &quot;But I thought that you had to be a telepath to get that thing 
working,&quot; Dani Moonstar asked him curiously.

        &quot;That&#39;s where I come in, I think,&quot; Rachel Summers smiled 
slightly. The redhead raised an eyebrow, &quot;I assume we&#39;re using it to 
track down evil mutants?&quot;

        &quot;And to be ready to help out any newly awakening mutants,&quot; Pete 
agreed. He shrugged slightly, &quot;I&#39;m certainly not qualified to actually 
train &#39;em, but for that I figure we can pass the kids on to Xavier&#39;s 
School itself.&quot;

        Rhane Sinclair began to chuckle to herself softly, and everyone 
looked over at her curiously. &quot;Sorry,&quot; the little redhead smiled just a 
bit sheepishly, &quot;I was just remembering when Mr. Wisdom was hurt and in 
a wheelchair. He, uhm, borrowed Moria&#39;s bathing cap and then did a 
really bad Prof. Xavier impersonation.&quot;

        Dani smirked, &quot;That I would have liked to have seen.&quot;

        &quot;Next time I&#39;m drunk,&quot; Pete promised, &quot;I&#39;ll do it as a party 
trick.&quot;

        Lisa Garrison shook her head with a slight smile as the slim 
blonde muttered quietly, &quot;Being in WHO and STRIKE was never like this.&quot;

        &quot;It sort of grows on you,&quot; Kate Pryde offered, the silver metal 
woman smiling slightly. She grinned, &quot;Or maybe it&#39;s infectious.&quot; The 
dragon Lockheed had already disappeared almost as soon as they arrived, 
likely getting into something again.

        &quot;I&#39;d bet on infectious,&quot; Rachel shrugged. She reached out with 
her telekinesis and tugged on Pete&#39;s collar forcefully to get his 
attention, &quot;I know it&#39;s a great setup, Mr. Wisdom,&quot; she said patiently, 
&quot;but it&#39;s been a pretty long day for most of us.&quot;

        &quot;Right, sorry,&quot; a slightly embarrassed Pete said as he lead all 
them back towards the residential section. &quot;The rooms are all either 
singles or doubles,&quot; he explained, &quot;and the doors can be voice keyed for 
up to two people.&quot;

        &quot;Double,&quot; Dani raised her hand, and Rhane nodded with a fierce 
blush. Both young women retreated together, while Rachel, Lisa and Kate 
all opted for singles.

        Pete looked over at the bedroom that he had claimed for himself 
earlier on, then shook his head firmly. He was still a bit too excited 
to try and get to sleep, so he made his way down the hallway towards the 
new operations center that Xavier had installed there after the decision 
to reactivate Excalibur had been made.

        One wall was a massive communications setup, with ties to the 
X-Men&#39;s headquarters, Avengers&#39; Mansion in New York, Alpha Flight&#39;s 
Department H in Canada, and finally a link to Russia&#39;s home superteam, 
whatever they were calling themselves this week.

        A central table, with monitor stations and other functions at 
each seat was set up in the middle of the room. It was placed so that 
they could use the communication system to talk with the other teams as 
well as allowing them to talk amongst themselves.

        &#39;And when needed, it&#39;ll make a fine dining room table too,&#39; Pete 
thought to himself wryly. He flopped down into one of the chairs to look 
up at the far wall, a sight he thought would be keeping him up nights 
from now on.

        The map was sodding huge, showing from the United Kingdom, all 
across Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Russia, China, Southeast Asia all 
the way down to Japan and Madripoor. As the X-Men and their allies 
covered North America, Excalibur and the X-corps divisions out here were 
going to be expected to watch over this part of the world.

        It was enough to drive a man to drink.

        &quot;If it helps any,&quot; an clearly amused sounding voice came up from 
behind him, &quot;there are a few local heroes available to help.&quot; Kate Pryde 
came into his line of sight before giving Pete a frown, &quot;You should be 
getting some sleep.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m still too wired to sleep,&quot; Pete shrugged slightly before 
looking up curiously, &quot;and shouldn&#39;t you be taking your own advice?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m an artificial being, more or less, so I don&#39;t need to 
sleep,&quot; Kate pointed out. She chuckled softly, &quot;I can certainly tell 
you&#39;re wired. I seem to remember you running off on the mouth when 
you&#39;re very nervous.&quot;

        &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Pete sighed. He looked up at the map, &quot;I&#39;m not 
deeply impressed with the local European superheroes, either.&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s always Shamrock,&quot; Kate smirked slightly, referring to 
the lucky green clover clad heroine of Ireland.

        &quot;Gah,&quot; Pete made a face.

        A chuckling Kate patted him gently on the shoulder as she 
reassured him, &quot;You know you&#39;ve got a good team here, Pete.&quot; She grinned 
slightly, &quot;And knowing you, you&#39;ve got a few other recruits hidden up 
your sleeve too.&quot;

        &quot;A couple,&quot; Pete rubbed at his eyes.

        &quot;Get some sleep,&quot; Kate said firmly before slipping out quietly.

        In one of the newly occupied bedrooms Dani Moonstar tossed a 
long nightshirt over her head even as Rhane disrobed beside her. &quot;I 
think I&#39;m going to like this suite&quot; Dani commented, the Native American 
woman slowing a bit as she felt Rhane&#39;s gaze on her body.

        &quot;If it gets cold,&quot; Rhane smiled up at her gently as the Scottish 
girl pulled her own night wear on, &quot;I promise to try to keep you warm.&quot;

        Dani nearly choked on a laugh, &quot;Who are you and where&#39;s the real 
Rhane?&quot;

        &quot;Right here,&quot; Rhane said softly, &quot;I&#39;m just a lot more relaxed 
around you.&quot; The two women got into the large double bed, snuggling 
together under the covers. Rhane hesitated, &quot;Dani, how long have you had 
feelings for me?&quot;

        Dani sighed, &quot;Quite a while, honestly.&quot; She smiled slightly, &quot;Do 
you remember when Legion hurt you, when you were visiting here a while 
back?&quot;

        &quot;Sam told be about it,&quot; Rhane murmured from the safety of Dani&#39;s 
arms, &quot;he said you were frantic to get to me.&quot;

        &quot;Being seperated from you then was hard enough,&quot; Dani shrugged 
slightly, &quot;but when you were hurt by him...&quot;

        &quot;I guess you couldn&#39;t have told me about it back then,&quot; Rhane 
admitted, thinking of the frightened, repressed girl she had once been.

        &quot;You probably would have fainted on the spot,&quot; Dani snickered, 
feeling Rhane also shaking with her laughter in her arms.

        In a room nearby Rachel Summers lay nude on her bed, gazing up 
at the ceiling while waiting for sleep to claim her. &#39;How could I have 
been so blind?&#39; she wondered. Working with Kate Pryde in the resistance, 
telling her conficences, they had been best friends. And she had 
completely missed the fact that Kate was falling in love with her.

        &quot;Guess being a telepath doesn&#39;t always help,&quot; Rachel muttered 
softly.

        Finally, Lisa Garrison was sitting on top of her covers, talking 
to someone softly on the telephone, &quot;Yeah, I miss you too, love.&quot;

        There was a short pause as Lisa listened, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll ask him 
about having you stay here on the island. I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll mind too 
much.&quot;

        She smirked just slightly at what she heard. &quot;Now there&#39;s a 
thought to go to bed to,&quot; Lisa snickered. With a gentle smile, &quot;I&#39;ll 
talk to you tomorrow.&quot; She set the phone down and rolled onto the bed, 
smiling goofily.

        &#39;Hope that Mr. Wisdom doesn&#39;t have a problem with it,&#39; Lisa 
thought. She sighed softly, &#39;The whole group seems pretty friendly, 
there shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&#39;

        Back in the command center Pete caught himself yawning. &quot;Guess I 
should get to bed,&quot; he got up and stretched out, yawning once again. 
&quot;Tomorrow&#39;s going to be another busy day,&quot; he murmured as he headed to 
bed.</pre>
