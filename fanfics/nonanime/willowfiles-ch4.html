<a href="../nonanime/willowfiles-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Don&#39;t even think about it,&quot; Willow Rosenburg growled,
her reddish brown hair falling into her eyes. The slim
young woman held a knife in one hand, glowing faintly,
while the other clutched a wooden stake.

It was winter in Seattle, and the skies were grey as a
light rain dribbled down on them both. The back alley
was dimly lit, dim enough that the vampire was able to
stand freely, his potential victim still struggling
weakly in his grasp.

&quot;You have got to be kidding me,&quot; the black haired man
looked disgusted at seeing Willow there, ready to
fight. He gave her a hard look, &quot;Just walk away,
little witch, it&#39;ll be better for both of us.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t do that,&quot; Willow said. A softly muttered word
sent power to her knife, and for a moment it blazed
with pure sunlight.

&quot;Ahh!&quot; the vampire threw his arm up to shield his
face, not incidentally releasing his struggling
captive.

Moving in Willow struck at the vampire with the ease
of long practice, driving the stake home into it&#39;s
heart. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she murmured to his surprised face
just as he crumbled away to a fine grey ash.

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; the boy looked at Willow in awe and more
than just a bit of fear, the vampire&#39;s near victim
pressed up against the wall. Without another word he
fled, bolting down the alley as fast as his feet could
carry him.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Willow called after him wryly,
slipping the knife and stake back into her shoulder
bag as she headed out of the alley too, rejoining
street life as she went off to carry out her own
errands.

The postal center was packed, with people picking up
late arriving Christmas gifts, sending out apology
cards for forgetting someone, and all that stuff plus
the usual business and day to day matters that kept
this kind of place busy.

&quot;How can I help you?&quot; the younger blonde haired woman
looked up at Willow over the top of her glasses, her
voice indicating absolutely no interest in her work or
in assisting with Willow&#39;s needs.

&quot;I need to send this out,&quot; Willow took out the
computer disk from her bag, still safely in it&#39;s
protective case, &quot;in a padded envelope as well as a
cover letter. How much?&quot;

&quot;Here,&quot; she held out her hand.

Willow passed over the disk and the woman put it on an
electronic scale, checking the weight against a chart.
After quoting the overnight, urgent and express prices
Willow picked the medium one, then bought the two
envelopes she needed too.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Willow took her stamps and went over to a
side counter, where she put the address on and
assembled her package.

&quot;Right, then...&quot; the mail lady took the envelope then
stopped, her eyes widening. &quot;Circe publications?!
You&#39;re a writer?&quot;

Willow felt herself blushing. &quot;Ah, well...&quot; she
stammered.

&quot;I read their Inferno line of erotica,&quot; the young
woman gushed happily, &quot;it&#39;s so hot! You gotta read
it!&quot;

&quot;Well, I did read a few for research,&quot; Willow found
herself confessing, wondering what god she had annoyed
to find herself in this situation.

&quot;God, a real writer right here in my line-up,&quot; the
mail girl shook her head, &quot;who would have thought!&quot;
She leaned forward, dropping her voice to ask, &quot;Is
this for one of their romances or... the hot stuff?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Willow felt herself blushing brighter as she
reluctantly admitted, &quot;it is going to their erotica
editor...&quot;

The mail lady nearly squealed with glee as she beamed
at Willow. She looked at the envelope, even as other
customers were getting restless. &quot;Rosebloom,&quot; she
noted the name as Willow excused herself, &quot;I&#39;ll keep
an eye out for your book.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; a fiercely blushing Willow sighed.

&#145;I can&#39;t believe that happened,&#39; Willow thought as she
took a moment to orient herself, standing outside the
bustling post office. &#145;Thank god I figured out a alias
to write under,&#39; she mused, &#145;I&#39;d be too embarrassed,
otherwise.&#39; Seeing a coffee shop nearby she made a
break for it, cutting across the busy street as the
misty rain fell.

&quot;Welcome to Starboots, can I take your order?&quot; the
young man asked, wearing the usual green and brown
uniform of the coffee giant. The place was busy, with
men and women drinking various coffees, late and
flavored drinks.

&quot;Coffee,&quot; Willow said.

&quot;Would you like a grande size, the mega-grande, our
excelsior or the ultimate bucket o&#39; joe?&quot; he asked.

Willow rolled her eyes at the odd terminology.
&quot;Mega-grande please,&quot; she said, leaning up against the
counter tiredly.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; he passed the coffee over, naming a
surprising price even for someone who was used to
California pricing.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Willow passed over the change then walked
over to a window seat, sitting down to watch the rain
make patterns on the glass. With a sigh she reached
into her bad for her notebook, setting it on the
table, digging out a pen and then beginning to write.

Dear Xander, Giles, Dawn and co.

I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t get out to Sunnydale for
Christmas. I took my best shot, but something came up
back east I had to deal with. I hope you all had a
good time, and I&#39;m sorry I missed it.

&#145;Well, not really,&#39; Willow thought a bit sadly. She
actually was kind of glad that the coven had sent her
to New York, it meant not having to go back to
Sunnydale and seeing Kennedy. Her last visit just a
few months ago had been bad enough, with Kennedy
alternating between trying to be a real friend and
snipping at her like a ex-lover. With a wry smile she
went back to her writing...

Thank you all for the gifts, by the way. I have no
idea where Xander found the Loving Lesbian book that
he sent me, but it was... enlightening reading. Dawny,
I&#39;m wearing your sweatshirt now, and it&#39;s keeping me
toasty warm. Giles, the reference guide to Native
American supernatural creatures has already come in
handy, and I suspect it will again.

FYI, Kennedy, please warm me if you&#39;re going to be
sending me something adult in the mail. I opened your
package in front of one of the other residents in my
building, a older lady, and the expression on her face
when the toy fell out was priceless. I was worried I
was going to have to try first aide for a minute
there.

I can imagine Giles wants to know about the New York
business, if only for his files. It was a fairly
simple situation, with a man possessed by a departed
spirit. Because of the power of the entity a normal
exorcism failed, and I was called in through a contact
with the coven. As a side comment, I continue to be in
awe of whom the coven is connected to. They even have
contacts in the Vatican!

On the personal end, things are going all right for
me. I&#39;m making some money with my freelance writing,
and in at least some situations I&#39;m being paid for my
supernatural work. That, plus my Watcher&#39;s allowance
is keeping my head above water. So no, Xander, you do
not need to send me money or any more care packages
made up by the young Slayers. Tho I did appreciate the
frosted chocolate brownies, they cheered me up a lot.

Anyway, Happy New Year to you all, Willow.

Willow capped her pen and tucked it and the paper away
just as she felt a presence nearby. Looking up she was
surprised to see the mail lady, looking faintly
uncomfortable as she stood nearby Willow&#39;s table.
&quot;Yes?&quot; Willow asked.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for losing it back there,&quot; the blonde took
off her glasses and smiled charmingly, having changed
out of the postal uniform to a casual shirt and jeans,
&quot;I hope I didn&#39;t make you feel uncomfortable.&quot;

Willow met those blue eyes and smiled, &quot;No, it just
surprised me a bit, Miss...?&quot;

&quot;Jesse,&quot; the blonde said. She gestured to the empty
seat across from Willow and politely asked, &quot;May I?&quot;

After a moment of silent debate Willow nodded,
deciding she&#39;d like the company. &quot;Willow,&quot; she smiled,
despite knowing the other woman knew her name.

&quot;So Willow,&quot; Jesse winked, &quot;come here often?&quot;

Willow snorting in amusement, &quot;No, not really.&quot;

&quot;Me either,&quot; Jesse agreed, &quot;too corporate.&quot; She leaned
back a bit, her breasts pushing against her shirt, &quot;I
only go here because it&#39;s convenient for work.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Willow agreed.

&quot;Though I have to say that today,&quot; Jesse gave Willow a
sweet smile, &quot;the coffee shop is a much brighter
place.&quot;

Willow blushed. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Just saying the truth,&quot; Jesse said. She paused, &quot;I
haven&#39;t offended you, have I?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Willow smiled back, &quot;I&#39;m just not used to
compliments.&quot;

&quot;Then people must be blind,&quot; Jesse said firmly.

&quot;You are way too charming,&quot; Willow laughed, &quot;but...
I&#39;m not darting right now.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t try to be your charming friend,&quot;
Jesse gave a roguish grin.

&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Willow smiled.

To be continued...

Notes: Yes, Starboots is a thinly disguised major
chain of coffee houses. The post office is based on a
similar but different experience that I had picking up
and mailing out gift packages over the Christmas season.</pre>
