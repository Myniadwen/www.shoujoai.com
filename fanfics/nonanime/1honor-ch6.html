<a href="../nonanime/1honor-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        Ryouko tried not to smile at the nearly terrified look on 
Honor&#39;s face as they met the young woman&#39;s Queen. &#39;Guess she really 
isn&#39;t used to this,&#39; she mused, the blue haired space pirate watching 
her newfound friend with amusement.

        &quot;So what do you think of this Michelle?&quot; Minagi asked her 
curiously as they entered the castle itself. Her scars marked her face 
but other than that she could pass for Ryouko&#39;s twin, something they had 
used to their advantage more than once.

        &quot;Not sure,&quot; Ryouko admitted, looking over at the dusky skinned 
woman beside Honor. &quot;She was certainly fierce when Honor was hurt, but 
other than that...,&quot; she shrugged.

        Washu dropped back, their little redheaded mother giving them 
scolding looks, &quot;More importantly it&#39;s none of our business.&quot;

        &quot;yes mom,&quot; Minagi smirked.

        &quot;Myah,&quot; Ryo-Ohki added cheerfully, the little cabbit bouncing 
along besides them down the thickly carpeted hallway.

        Ryouko rolled her eyes. &quot;Do you think Honor noticed our little 
surprise yet?&quot; she asked with a impish little smile.

        &quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Washu said thoughtfully, &quot;though she has 
been a bit distracted.&quot;

        The Queen led them into a beautifully decorated parlor, 
comfortable chairs and couches set up around the cozy room. Elizabeth 
was a beautiful woman, her dusky skin glowing in the light, but there 
was strength in the young woman&#39;s slim form. &quot;Sit down,&quot; she smiled 
warmly, &quot;I&#39;ll have some food sent up in a moment.&quot;

        They took their seats but Honor moved away from Michelle to go 
over to Washu. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said sheepishly, &quot;but I think you made a 
mistake with my uniform.&quot; She touched her collar, &quot;These are the 
insignia of a captain, I&#39;m just a commander.&quot;

        &quot;No mistake,&quot; Washu smiled.

        &quot;What,&quot; Honor blinked in surprise.

        &quot;You&#39;ve been promoted,&quot; Elizabeth said to Honor calmly, sitting 
down with her dress swirling around her legs.

        &quot;And there&#39;s no favoritism involved,&quot; Ryouko pointed out with a 
grin, her blue hair falling into her eyes. &quot;Almost everyone in Gryphon&#39;s 
Navy is getting a bump up,&quot; she added.

        &quot;Not that you haven&#39;t earned it,&quot; Michelle murmured as she 
guided a mildly shaken Honor into a seat beside her on the couch.

        &quot;Bleek,&quot; Nimitz agreed, the tree-cat comfortably resting on 
Honor&#39;s shoulder. He had climbed up there as soon as Honor had been 
released from sickbay and seemed entirely unwilling to move.

        Minagi looked like she was trying to hold back a laugh at the 
look on Honor&#39;s face. &quot;Ah, food,&quot; she grinned as the servants brought 
trays of snacks in, setting them around the room along with glasses of 
various beverages. &quot;So should we discuss business or...?&quot; Minagi asked.

        &quot;Some business, maybe,&quot; Elizabeth said, giving Ryouko a 
questioning look.

        &quot;Yeah, why not,&quot; Ryouko agreed. She sat back casually, drinking 
from a generous sized bottle of sake as she asked, &quot;How long do you 
think it&#39;ll take to shake down the merged fleets?&quot;

        &quot;Three months minimum,&quot; Washu answered firmly. &quot;Our Manticore 
people are going to have to adapt to the Gryphon military style and the 
Gryphons need to be fully briefed and fully trained to use our tech,&quot; 
she explained.

        Honor shook herself, but the lady managed to get back into the 
conversation. &quot;I&#39;m surprised it would be that fast,&quot; she admitted.

        &quot;I wondered about that myself,&quot; Elizabeth drank some wine.

        &quot;We&#39;ve had some experience in integrating allied forces,&quot; Minagi 
explained, &quot;though admittedly not on quite this scale before.&quot;

        &quot;I hope we&#39;ll be able to help,&quot; Michelle offered with a smile.

        &quot;Trust me,&quot; Ryouko grinned at the two officers, &quot;we&#39;ll probably 
be asking.&quot; She took another drink, &quot;But the Admiralty has fallen nicely 
into line and the crews seem eager to get to work, so I&#39;m staying 
optimistic.&quot;

        &quot;Barring unforeseen occurrences,&quot; Washu cautioned. She sampled 
some wine as she remarked, &quot;Murphy&#39;s law seems universal.&quot;

        &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Minagi agreed.

        &quot;Speaking of ships,&quot; Ryouko raised her glass to the still mildly 
pale Honor, &quot;I was thinking of assigning the star-destroyer Nike to you. 
She&#39;s a recent product of the Manticore shipyards and I&#39;ve great hopes 
for her.&quot;

        Honor gulped, &quot;I&#39;d be honored.&quot;

        &quot;Cousin,&quot; Michelle spoke up. Elizabeth looked over at her 
questioningly as she continued, &quot;Would you mind if I spoke to Honor 
privately?&quot;

        &quot;Go on,&quot; Elizabeth smiled.

        &quot;Ah....&quot; Honor didn&#39;t even have a chance to say anything as 
Michelle drew her to her feet. The two women were out of the room in 
moments, leaving the others with amused smiles.

        &quot;About time,&quot; Ryouko chuckled.

        Honor blinked, trying to get her thoughts in some kind of order 
as she and Michelle walked down the hallway together. It had been a 
hectic hour since she had awakened in the Revenge&#39;s sickbay, not to 
mention the shock of her sudden promotion and the offer of a ship.

        &quot;Come on,&quot; Michelle opened up the door, ushering Honor inside 
and then closing and locking it behind them. The bedroom suite looked 
lived in, in fact clothes that Honor recognized as belonging to Michelle 
hung in the closet.

        &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Honor turned to meet Michelle&#39;s dark eyes and 
asked, &quot;What are we doing in your bedroom?&quot;

        Michelle smiled slightly from where she stood a little ways away 
from Honor, puffing out her breath in a soft sigh. &quot;You know,&quot; she said 
softly, &quot;I had this all planned out. We were both going to be on the 
beach, I was going to let you get settled in first. We&#39;d go out together 
as friends, get you more comfortable with the idea....&quot;

        &quot;Comfortable with what?&quot; Honor asked, an odd tightness in her 
chest.

        &quot;Then this thing with Manticore happened,&quot; Michelle said. Her 
smile was wry, &quot;When I first heard that you and the Fearless had made 
contact with the Washu&#39;s Revenge I was so scared. Then I thought of what 
I heard about Ryouko and got really worried.&quot;

        &quot;But....&quot; Honor managed before Michelle continued.

        &quot;When you got back I was so relieved,&quot; Michelle flashed a smile, 
&quot;and proud of you. I wanted to tell you so much but there wasn&#39;t time, 
and I knew we&#39;d find time to talk later.&quot; Her eyes darkened, &quot;Then you 
were shot right in front of me.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Honor started, then corrected herself, &quot;well, no 
I&#39;m not. I was doing my duty, but I&#39;m sorry I frightened you.&quot;

        &quot;More than that, you terrified me,&quot; Michelle murmured. She moved 
closer to Honor, looking up at the taller woman thoughtfully before 
saying, &quot;I don&#39;t want any regrets, Honor.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Honor admitted.

        &quot;Then maybe this will help,&quot; and with that Michelle slid her 
arms around Honor, drawing her close. The kiss was firm but gentle, the 
two pressing close, only parting reluctantly a few moments later. &quot;I 
love you, Honor,&quot; Michelle said, &quot;I can&#39;t wait to tell you any longer.&quot;

        Honor&#39;s cheeks were bright red but joy shone in her eyes. &quot;I 
love you, too,&quot; she whispered, &quot;since back in our academy days.&quot;

        &quot;Bleek,&quot; Nimitz protested, reluctantly jumping down from his 
spot on Honor&#39;s shoulder.

        &quot;Sorry Stinker,&quot; Michelle smiled down at him before snuggling 
closer to Honor. &quot;Until you kissed me back then I thought my feelings 
were one- sided,&quot; she confessed.

        &quot;You might have told me,&quot; Honor sighed, &quot;I thought that, too.&quot;

        Michelle looked up at Honor gently, &quot;You made it very clear back 
then you weren&#39;t ready for something like this.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re probably right,&quot; Honor admitted, &quot;I was scared of any 
intimacy, especially after Young attacked me.&quot; Her eyes widened, &quot;You 
didn&#39;t have feelings for me back then, did you?&quot;

        &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Michelle&#39;s voice was dangerous, &quot;and if I had half a 
chance Young would never have been able to hurt anyone again.&quot; She 
snuggled closer and quietly, &quot;So what do we do now?&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Honor held her, &quot;but I&#39;m not losing this, not 
when I just found it.&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Michelle nodded towards the bed, &quot;I meant that.&quot;

        &quot;Michelle!&quot; Honor blurted, cheeks flaming.

        Michelle slid free, grabbing hold of Honor&#39;s hand and drawing 
her forward gently. &quot;I promise I&#39;ll be gentle,&quot; she reassured her 
softly.

        &quot;I&#39;ve never....&quot; Honor&#39;s face was flaming.

        &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Michelle purred as she drew Honor down to the 
bed, &quot;I haven&#39;t either.&quot; She smiled, &quot;I think we can figure it out, 
though.&quot;</pre>
