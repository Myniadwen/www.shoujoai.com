<h1>Kitty and Illyana: A Tale of Magik! (part 20 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Allistaire Stewart frowned as the brown haired man
bent over a console, studying the readouts intently.
He wore a battered brown suit, smudged a bit from his
work, and the long overcoat he had on looked like it
had seen some wear.

A woman almost alike enough to be his twin neared, the
military uniform that she wore marking her an officer
in the British army, a colonel in the Weird Happenings
Organization. &quot;Any progress?&quot; Alysande Stuart asked
her brother.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Allistaire looked up, taking in the ring
of standing stones that were now lit up like a
Christmas tree. The silvery fire danced from stone to
stone, leaping and jumping eerily in the twilight. He
puffed out a sigh, &quot;It resembles readings from certain
events stateside and up on Muir Isle, but that&#39;s all
I&#39;ve got so far.&quot;

&quot;The Phoenix incident?&quot; Alysande raised an eyebrow in
surprise. She was about to ask another question when
an officer rushed to their side.

&quot;Something odd&#39;s happening by the lake,&quot; he puffed.

&quot;Something else?&quot; Allistaire asked curiously. They
walked over to the nearby lake, blinking in surprise
as the water bubbled and frothed oddly, then it
suddenly... it erupted!

&quot;Incoming!&quot; Kitty Pryde yelled as the four women
spilled out onto the shore, knocking the two of them
over in a pile of limbs.

&quot;Pryde,&quot; Illyanna growled out, the slim blonde pinned
beneath both Kitty and the badly embarrassed Rachel,
her black and gold insulated uniform hugging her body.

&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Phoenix smoothly rose, the redhead
offering her hand to help up the frowning Alysande,
her sweatpants and shirt chosen for comfort.

&quot;I didn&#39;t realize that would happen,&quot; Kitty quickly
scrambled to get off of Illyanna then the brown haired
woman helped her lover up as she mused aloud, &quot;maybe
it&#39;s something to do with the uncertainty
principle....&quot;

&quot;Fascinating,&quot; Allistaire looked them over after he
picked himself up, brushing his clothes off rather
absent mindedly. &quot;Americans, I take it?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Rachel waved tentatively as she looked around,
&quot;this is England, right?&quot; Her red one piece hugged her
slim body, the gold &#39;X&#39; belt buckle gleaming.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Alysande also brushed herself off, &quot;my name
is Alysande Stuart, the head of the Weird Happenings
organization and this is our chief scientist, my
brother Allistaire.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Phoenix blinked.

A ghost of a smile teased Alysande&#39;s lips as she said,
&quot;No, W.H.O.&quot;

Kitty found herself smiling at that, meeting the
amused eyes of the other woman. &quot;Katherine Pryde,&quot; she
said, tugging nervously at her blue bodysuit, &quot;and
these are my associates Illyanna Rasputin, Rachel
Summers and... Jean.&quot;

&quot;The new sorcerer supremes,&quot; Allistaire looked at
Kitty and Illyanna with respect in his eyes, as well
as a bit of amusement..

&quot;How did you know about that?&quot; Illyanna blinked in
surprise.

&quot;We try to keep abreast of this sort of thing,&quot;
Alysande said gravely, &quot;I take it you are here because
of the stone circle here?&quot;

Phoenix nodded gravely as the red and gold haired
woman said, &quot;I think so, we&#39;re nearly on top of the...
event that I sensed.&quot;

Illyanna looked around, spotting the mystical flames
that shone over the heavy stone blocks not far from
where they stood. &quot;Do you mind if we...?&quot; she nodded
towards them.

Alysande looked over at Allistaire, &quot;Will they
contaminate the site?&quot;

&quot;Should be fine,&quot; Allistare offered, &quot;we&#39;re not making
much progress yet, anyway. An outside, not to mention
occult, perspective might be useful.&quot;

&quot;Lead the way,&quot; Kitty grinned.

&quot;I wonder how they found out about you two?&quot; Rachel
asked softly as the group briskly walked towards the
site.

&quot;We did get into a public fight in Times Square,&quot;
Illyanna noted.

As they neared the circle of stones more and more
sophisticated equipment was set up, Kitty looking
around her wide eyed. &quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; she finally
commented to Alysande, &quot;you must be fairly well
funded.&quot;

&quot;A combination of government and private donations,&quot;
Alysande casually dismissed it as they reached the
barrier intended to keep onlookers away. She lifted
the rope and waved them on by, then followed them in.

This near the ring of small stones the air crackled
with static electricity, an odd sensation like there
was a storm coming. The stones themselves were barely
a foot or two high, inscribed with arcane symbols and
text, set in an odd pattern almost resembling an
eight.

&quot;Mobius strip?&quot; Rachel blinked, looking at how the
stones were placed.

&quot;Looks like it,&quot; Illyanna agreed, circling the area as
she narrowed her eyes, calling on her training to try
and get a feel for what was going on.

Kitty noticed how pale the Phoenix looked and asked,
&quot;You all right?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s evil here,&quot; Phoenix answered her grimly, &quot;and...
corrupt, somehow.&quot; She shuddered visibly, &quot;But oddly
familiar, too.&quot;

Rachel took Phoenix&#39;s hand, gazing worriedly at the
woman who was wearing a body so like hers. &quot;Let me
help,&quot; she offered softly and Phoenix smiled at her in
relief.

&quot;Interesting,&quot; a watching Alysande commented
thoughtfully, standing there in a relaxed pose, her
hands clasped behind her back. She looked over at
Illyanna and asked her, &quot;I take it your friend is a
sensitive of some sort?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Illyanna calmly agreed as Kitty
walked over to them, Allistaire lingering nearby as he
observed.

Kitty seriously asked, &quot;What&#39;s the history of the
site?&quot;

&quot;The site came to our attention a little over a month
ago,&quot; Allistaire provided, &quot;when some phenomenon
pushed the stones from underground to the surface.&quot; He
nodded to rocks, &quot;This appears to be just the tips of
much larger slabs of rock, we&#39;ve dated a sample to
over 3000 years old.&quot;

&quot;How long has the lightning been there?&quot; Illyanna
asked.

&quot;Less than two weeks,&quot; Alysande said crisply.

&quot;Almost sounds like the same time Rachel arrived,&quot;
Kitty murmured. She looked up thoughtfully, &quot;Anything
else we should know?&quot;

&quot;The energies involved appear to resemble those
registered at appearances of the American superhuman
Phoenix,&quot; Allistaire offered, &quot;but subtlety different,
too.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Illyanna whispered.

Kitty nodded grimly, her eyes narrowed slightly. She
walked over to the stones, raising her hands to the
amulet as she added, &quot;I&#39;m going to try a scan, see if
we can find out what&#39;s going on.&quot; The amulet on her
throat irised open, the shining gem floating as it
began to glow, casting a beam into the earth below the
rocks....

..... when Kitty suddenly screamed, fire coursing back
along the light to engulf her!

&quot;Kitty!&quot; Illyanna charged while the Soulsword appeared
in her hands. She swung two handed down on the beam,
severing the connection with a blaze of power.

Kitty was thrown backwards, limp as a ragdoll but
Rachel reached out with her telekinetic powers to slow
her fall. Alysande raced forward, grabbing Kitty
before she hit the ground as the others ran over to
their side.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Phoenix demanded worriedly.

&quot;Owww,&quot; Kitty groaned, shaking her head. She managed
to smile at Illyanna and Alysande, &quot;Thanks, both of
you.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Illyanna demanded, helping her lover
up with surprising gentleness.

&quot;Whatever is under there latched on to me somehow,&quot;
Kitty pushed her now sweaty hair up out of her face,
&quot;tried to drain my life force right out of me.&quot;

Allistaire was taking notes excitedly, &quot;A psionic
vampire, maybe?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re all right,&quot; Rachel sighed to
Kitty. She looked up and over to Phoenix, her
expression almost accusing as she said, &quot;You know what
it is, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Phoenix answered, &quot;or at least, I have a
very good guess.&quot;

&quot;So what is it?&quot; Alysande asked impatiently.

&quot;Anti-Phoenix,&quot; she answered, Phoenix&#39;s face grave.
