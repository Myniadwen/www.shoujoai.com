<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Bishop couldn&#39;t keep the relieved smile off of his face as he reported 
back to work. Everyone was over the worst of the sickness, and after 
listening to over a week of their whining he was looking forward to 
the regular trials of police work.

&quot;Nobody should be that happy coming in to work on a Monday,&quot; a very 
amused sounding woman&#39;s voice said from right behind him. He turned 
around to see Cat standing there, looking her usual exuberant self.

&quot;After the past week,&quot; Bishop trailed off, shrugged eloquently, and 
Cat laughed. He looked at the perky blonde thoughtfully. Things had 
been pretty hectic, and she had taken the revelation that her partner 
was an X- man pretty well. Maybe too well.

They were driving on patrol when Cat asked him, &quot;I noticed your 
friends just call you Bishop. Do you prefer that, or Lucas?&quot;

&quot;I answer to both,&quot; Bishop said with a smile, &quot;but I do prefer 
Bishop.&quot;

&quot;Is it OK if I call you that?&quot; Cat asked tentatively.

Bishop looked over at the petite blonde thoughtfully, &quot;Sure.&quot;

Cat grinned up at him, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

Back at the house, Rogue put a hand on Neal&#39;s shoulder to stop him 
from going upstairs to use the computer. &quot;Kitty&#39;s working on her 
physics paper,&quot; Rogue grinned, &quot;and I wouldn&#39;t risk disturbing her 
right now.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad to see she&#39;s continuing her education,&quot; Elizabeth smiled at 
her before asking, &quot;is she doing it on-line?&quot;

&quot;Yep,&quot; she nodded and Rogue sounded quite proud of Kitty when she 
added, &quot;through a program with MIT.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Neal admitted. He and Elizabeth went over to use the 
office computer on the main floor. It was a bit slower, but should be 
fine for his e-mail.

&#39;Too bad Kitty has a deadline,&#39; Rogue though. Up till now Kitty had 
always put her work for her classes early, but dealing with everyone 
being sick had put her a bit behind.

&quot;Protecting everyone from the dangers of a crabby Kitty, I see,&quot; Raven 
grinned at her adopted daughter.

&quot;How did you know about..?&quot; Rogue started to asked, then she smiled, 
&quot;Storm, of course.&quot;

Raven nodded, &quot;Ororo told me about Kitty&#39;s irritability level going up 
while she works on a difficult project.&quot;

&quot;Or has a deadline,&quot; Ororo herself added. She looked at Rogue 
thoughtfully, &quot;Has Kitty had any luck finding out about the Hand cadre 
that attacked us?&quot;

&quot;Both Kitty and Elizabeth are checking into it,&quot; Rogue shrugged 
eloquently, &quot;but there&#39;s not been much progress so far. Kitty does 
think the woman leading the Hand, Sakura, wasn&#39;t a Hand assassin 
herself.&quot;

&quot;Is this a theory, or does Kitty have something to back it up?&quot; Raven 
asked.

&quot;Theory, I think,&quot; Rogue shrugged again, &quot;Sakura didn&#39;t act like your 
typical assassin, she said.&quot;

&quot;Then there&#39;s the teleporting she described,&quot; Ororo noted. &quot;If it 
wasn&#39;t a natural ability, then it implies a great deal or resources 
behind her,&quot; she sighed.

&quot;And a medium long list of adversaries whom she might be working for,&quot; 
Raven noted. &quot;There&#39;s Apocalypse, Dr. Doom, Mr. Sinister, Stryfe, and 
a few others,&quot; she frowned slightly, trying to remember.

&quot;None of whom are pushovers,&quot; Rogue sighed.

A joyful cry echoed down from the stairs. &quot;Finished,&quot; Kitty cried, and 
they could hear her dancing around the little upstairs office. A few 
moments later she phased through the roof down to them, throwing her 
arms around Rogue, &quot;Thanks for keeping distractions down, love.&quot;

Rogue blushed, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

Kitty, still holding on to Rogue, said to Ororo, &quot;We did a patrol with 
Elizabeth last night, and it looks like the Hand have left Australia.&quot;

&quot;And Lady Deathstryke?&quot; Raven asked. She had heard about Lady 
Deathstryke helping Kitty and Rogue fight the Hand, and was mildly 
intrigued. &#39;Could she be considering changing sides, too?&#39; she 
wondered.

&quot;Still in town,&quot; Rogue said, &quot;supposedly on business.&quot;

&quot;Very interesting,&quot; Sage said quietly. The pale woman looked even 
paler after being out of the sun for a week, but she looked a lot 
better than she had.

Ororo looked at her narrowly, &quot;Are you feeling all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m much better, thanks,&quot; Sage actually blushed a bit. The poison had 
caused her to make one or two messes, something Kitty, Rogue and the 
others had to clean up after. &quot;Heather and I were planning to go into 
town, would you like us to check Lady Deathstryke out? Discretely, of 
course,&quot; she hastened to add.

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Raven looked curiously at Ororo.

&quot;Not a bad idea,&quot; Ororo agreed. &quot;But stay out of her way, and don&#39;t 
start anything,&quot; she cautioned her.

&quot;Right,&quot; Sage gave a slightly mocking salute.

As Sage was walking away Kitty said quietly, &quot;Has anybody noticed that 
Heather has practically moved in here since Sage got sick?&quot;

Rogue grinned, &quot;Yep.&quot;

&quot;Here&#39;s hoping she decides to stay,&quot; Raven said softly.

&quot;Let&#39;s grab some lunch,&quot; Kitty grabbed Rogue&#39;s arm, noticing that 
Ororo was giving Raven a &#39;we have to talk&#39; look.

Ororo and Raven walked out on the porch together, looking out at the 
surf. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Raven asked quietly.

Ororo smiled at her, &quot;Don&#39;t get your hopes up with Lady Deathstryke.&quot; 
She sighed softly, &quot;She&#39;s an honorable woman, but her motives and 
motivations are complex.&quot;

&quot;So were mine,&quot; Raven pointed out.

Ororo squeezed her hand gently, &quot;But your intentions were good. 
Deathstryke seems to lack that sort of moral compass.&quot;

&quot;And yet she fought by the X-men&#39;s side once against Stryfe,&quot; Raven 
noted.

&quot;True,&quot; Ororo agreed, &quot;but out of her own self interest.&quot;

Sage walked away from the group and down the hallway to her bedroom 
door. She knocked on it softly, and heard Heather call out, &quot;Come in.&quot;

Sage opened the door, and froze. &#39;She really is a natural blonde,&#39; was 
the thought that ran through her mind right before she turned around, 
her cheeks flaming.

There was the sound of a soft swish of fabric, and Heather&#39;s hand 
gently rested on Sage&#39;s shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Heather sounded 
quite amused as she continued, &quot;I&#39;m covered now.&quot; Sage turned a bit to 
see her in a terrycloth robe, and sighed in relief and a bit of 
disappointment.

Sage was still blushing fiercely as she said, &quot;Ororo says it&#39;s all 
right if we go into town together.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right if you see me nude, you know,&quot; Heather said gently. 
She smiled slightly, &quot;I certainly saw all you had while I was taking 
care of you.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Sage squeaked.

&quot;Who do you think helped bathe you while you were sick?&quot; Heather 
asked.

Sage&#39;s cheeks went even redder, if possible. &quot;Oh, god,&quot; she muttered 
to herself softly, covering her face with her hands.

&quot;You really are cute when you blush,&quot; Heather chuckled softly, &quot;that 
must be why I like you to do it so often.&quot;

Deciding not to answer that Sage asked, &quot;So do you still want to go to 
town?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Heather said gently. She smiled wickedly as she tugged 
at the sash of her robe, &quot;Would you like to help me get dressed?&quot;

Sage looked up at her, her cheeks flaming, then she surprised both of 
them by saying, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Kitty grinned at Rogue as she made sandwiches for both of them. &quot;So 
what do you think of Heather staying here?&quot; she asked.

&quot;She&#39;s good for Sage,&quot; Rogue smiled, &quot;almost as good as you are for 
me.&quot;

&quot;Flatterer,&quot; Kitty leaned forward, kissing her gently.

That same day, in an long abandoned town in the Australian outback, 
Sakura looked around her thoughtfully. The dust blew down what was 
left of the main street, and for a moment the silver haired woman 
though she was in some American ghost town.

She stepped into a broken down building and activated a concealed 
lift, dropping several levels below the surface and into an 
technologically advanced headquarters. The woman in a simple white 
bodysuit walked down a hall to a much larger open chamber, converted 
from a treasure vault into their new training center.

&quot;This is quite the facility,&quot; Sakura nodded.

&quot;The town formerly belonged to the bandit group called the Reavers, 
until the X-Men defeated them. The X-Men themselves used it, until the 
Reavers expelled them again,&quot; Stryfe said.

&quot;And what happened to the Reavers?&quot; Sakura asked him curiously.

&quot;Slain by the Sentinels,&quot; Stryfe said even as the silver armored 
figure reviewed the video files from the training sessions. Quietly he 
asked, &quot;Are they improving?&quot;

&quot;Somewhat. None of them are happy about the training, but they are 
beginning to work together quite well,&quot; Sakura said. She brought up a 
file, and two savage figures were shown tearing through simulated 
enemies. &quot;McCoy and Feral are remarkably effective together,&quot; Sakura 
smiled.

Stryfe smiled grimly, &quot;As I expected. What about Plasma and Polaris?&quot;

&quot;Plasma&#39;s arrogant, but I think I can keep her in line,&quot; Sakura 
reported. &quot;Polaris may well be the glue that holds this organization 
together,&quot; Sakura admitted, &quot;she mediates fights and keeps them 
focused on the task ahead.&quot;

&quot;And are they accepting your command?&quot; Stryfe asked with a little 
smile.

A bleak little smile and Sakura said, &quot;They know not to disobey me.&quot;

Stryfe lead Sakura into the main command center, his long red cape 
blowing around him. They brought up images from the surface, looking 
into the rooms each of their agents had taken. Feral&#39;s was a rat&#39;s 
nest, cluttered already, McCoy&#39;s was pristine, except for the animal&#39;s 
in their cages, Polaris&#39;s was mostly bare, and Plasma&#39;s was clean, 
both her and Polaris talking together.

&quot;So Alex was your lover, too?&quot; Polaris sighed softly. The green haired 
woman looked out the glass window as the dust blew by.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Plasma said softly. She looked down, just a bit uncomfortable 
as she said, &quot;I didn&#39;t know that he was taken at the time.&quot;

Polaris sighed softly, &quot;Alex could be a fool for a pretty face.&quot;

Stryfe switched screens, &quot;She had greater self control than I 
expected.&quot; She looked over at Sakura thoughtfully, &quot;And has our... 
guest arrived yet?&quot;

Sakura checked her watch, &quot;He should be arriving at the airport any 
time now.&quot;

The figure stepped down from the airplane, clearly working to control 
his temper has he was jostled by the crowds. He pushed his blonde hair 
back, and his finger nails glinted metallic in the sunlight. He strode 
to the arrivals desk, calmly presenting his passport.

&quot;Victor Crane,&quot; the young woman compared his face to the photo, 
stamping the passport page calmly.

Victor Creed smiled, trying not to let his fangs show, &quot;Nice to meet 
you.&quot; He produced a piece of paper, &quot;Medical notice, for the pins in 
my hands.&quot;

The metal detector went off when they ran it over his hands, and the 
security officer nodded. &quot;Right,&quot; the clearly bored man nodded.

Victor strode through the airport with a smile on his face. He 
collected his baggage, &#39;Now to find the little Kitty-cat. Wonder if I 
should send a piece of her to Logan when I&#39;m done?&#39;

With that pleasant thought bringing a smile to his face, Victor Creed 
caught a taxi into town.
