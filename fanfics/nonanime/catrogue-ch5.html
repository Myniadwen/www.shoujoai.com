<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Psylocke stopped Kitty as they escorted Mystique in. &quot;Could I talk to 
you a moment?&quot; Elizabeth asked her quietly. Kitty gulped, and nodded.

&quot;Rogue, I&#39;ll meet you in a few minutes,&quot; Kitty called to her. Rogue 
waved, Storm and Mystique on either side of her.

Kitty and Psylocke walked into the kitchen, where Kitty quickly took 
the offensive. Bowing, she said &quot;Elizabeth, I&#39;m really sorry for 
interfering with you fight with Vargas. I know you wanted to take him 
on, and I&#39;m sure Rogue really appreciated the help, but..&quot;

Psylocke held up a hand, an amused smile on her face, &quot;Kitty, it&#39;s all 
right! I just wanted to thank you for maybe saving my life.&quot; She 
grinned a bit, adding, &quot;But if you really must apologize, I certainly 
won&#39;t stop you.&quot;

Kitty blushed brightly, looking downwards and unsure of what to say. 
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Kitty said with a wry smile.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen you fight like that,&quot; Psylocke said 
softly, &quot;he was totally outmatched. How did you do that?&quot;

Kitty just shrugged a bit uncomfortably, &quot;I guess I&#39;ve never had 
someone I loved in that kind of mortal danger before.&quot;

Vargas had attacked the X-men without warning, ambushing the team with 
his two aides. Distracting part of the team, he pursued Rogue with a 
vengeance, his sword a precision instrument in his hands. Psylocke 
intervened, crossing her psionic blades with the mysterious, dark 
hared warrior, but Kitty quickly realized that Elizabeth was 
outmatched by this physical wonder. As Vargas was about to deliver a 
killing blow, Kitty intervened.

For what might have been the first time in her life, Kitty fought an 
enemy without any of her self-imposed restraints, knowing that Rogue 
and Psylocke would likely die if he was able to defeat her. She called 
upon all the combat skills Wolverine had worked so hard to develop in 
her, and then she combined it with a savagery that she had never 
experienced before. Finally realizing that he might be in serious 
danger, Vargas withdrew, taking his allies with him.

Psylocke took a half step back from where Kitty stood, falling down to 
one knee. In perfectly clear Japanese she asked her, &quot;Sensei, would 
you take this unworthy one as your student?&quot;

Kitty looked at her in shock and disbelief, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;There goes the smooth approach,&quot; Psylocke sighed softly. She gave 
Kitty a wry smile as she explained, &quot;It&#39;s obvious that you&#39;ve become a 
better fighter than I am. If Vargas attacks again, I want to be ready 
for him.&quot;

Kitty sighed, a faint blush coloring her cheeks. &quot;You should really go 
to Wolverine,&quot; Kitty said, sounding a bit desperate.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Psylocke said, shaking her head a bit, &quot;you may 
have even surpassed him.&quot; At Kitty&#39;s disbelieving look, she elaborated 
&quot;Despite all that Logan&#39;s learned about fighting over the years, he&#39;s 
still a brawler at heart. You&#39;ve taken all he taught you, mixed it 
with your ninja training, and made it your own.&quot;

Kitty looked at Psylocke steadily, and realized that she meant what 
she said. Kitty sighed wearily, &quot;OK, I&#39;ll do it. But on one 
condition.&quot; Psylocke looked at Kitty enquiringly, and Kitty added 
&quot;Rogue gets to sit in on our training sessions.&quot;

Elizabeth frowned, &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because I don&#39;t want my girlfriend getting jealous,&quot; Kitty explained 
with a fierce blush. Elizabeth broke into quiet laughter, even as 
Kitty blushed harder.

&quot;When do we start?&quot; Elizabeth asked eagerly.

Kitty smiled, &quot;Six AM tomorrow morning, I think.&quot; She sighed, &quot;Rogue 
is not going to be happy about this.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Elizabeth said with a smile and a respectful bow before 
she left. Kitty stood there, still mildly stunned by Elizabeth&#39;s 
actions, for a few moments, then went upstairs.



Raven looked over at Ororo thoughtfully, &quot;So you and your merry band 
are chasing Destiny&#39;s diaries, Wind Rider?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ororo said with a nod, sitting with Rogue as Raven began to 
unpack her bags. They had both offered to help, but she wanted to do 
it herself.

&quot;Now, here comes the important question,&quot; Raven said, looking up to 
give her a piercing look, &quot;do you intend to use them?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Rogue spoke up calmly. Storm gave her an odd look, but nodded 
her agreement.

&quot;Why not?&quot; Raven said with a bit of honest surprise in her voice. She 
had devoted half her life to following one of the diaries, and she 
couldn&#39;t imagine not using them.

&quot;The diaries may tell the future,&quot; Rogue said with a shrug, &quot;but I&#39;d 
rather live my life without them, and at least keep the illusion of 
free will.&quot;

&quot;Very eloquent,&quot; Raven noted thoughtfully, even as she began to digest 
what Rogue had said. It made a lot of sense to her.

Rogue shrugged uncomfortably, &quot;It&#39;s hanging around Pryde, probably. 
She&#39;s a good influence on me.&quot;

Storm kneeled forward, &quot;I don&#39;t intend to leave the diaries in the 
hands of our enemies, the damage they could do is immense. But I don&#39;t 
think any human is wise enough or capable enough to use them to shape 
the future.&quot;

&quot;I certainly learned that lesson,&quot; Raven sighed softly. She shook her 
self, and looked up to meet Ororo&#39;s gaze again, those striking blue 
eyes.

&quot;The past is the past,&quot; Ororo said gently. She stood up, and actually 
smiled at Raven as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll leave you two to catch up.&quot;

Kitty smiled at Ororo as she passed her, then headed into Raven&#39;s new 
room. Rogue was in the process of asking her mother, &quot;What&#39;s the story 
between you two?&quot;

Raven rolled her eyes. &quot;There&#39;s no story,&quot; she insisted.

Kitty chuckled softly. &quot;The way you two acted outside says otherwise,&quot; 
she pointed out with a sly grin on her face.

&quot;Your girlfriend is far too perceptive,&quot; Raven groused to Rogue, who 
just grinned at her cheerfully. She began to stuff socks into a empty 
dresser drawer as she reluctantly said, &quot;We, well, we flirted once, a 
long time ago.&quot;

&quot;Oh ho!&quot; Rogue chuckled softly, &quot;Flirting! Now we&#39;re getting 
somewhere. But details! We want details!&quot;

&quot;Next thing I know, you&#39;ll be wanting a bedtime story,&quot; Raven sighed.

Rogue smirked as she said, &quot;Nah, I have Kitty for that.&quot; Raven gave 
Kitty a look, and noticed the brown girl blushing fiercely.

Kitty noticed that Raven was looking a bit put upon, so she put her 
hand on Rogue&#39;s shoulder to gently guide her out of the room. &quot;C&#39;mon, 
love, we&#39;d better let her finish unpacking,&quot; Kitty said gently. She 
sighed as something else occurred to her, &quot;Besides, I better explain 
why we&#39;ll be having a six AM wake up call for a bit.&quot;

Rogue was following Kitty out while asking her plaintively, &quot;Why do I 
have to be up then?&quot; Raven watched them go with a great deal of 
amusement.

Raven finished her unpacking before sitting down on the edge of her 
bed. She thought about the look on Storm&#39;s face when they met, the 
nervousness she had been feeling. &#39;Not a good sign,&#39; she thought with 
a little smile.



Elizabeth was dressed in her battle costume, looking agile and ready 
for anything. Rogue sat on a desk chair, while Kitty only wore a 
sweatshirt and shorts. Kitty stretched her body, giving Psylocke a 
cheery smile.

&quot;All right, I want you to attack me,&quot; Kitty said seriously, &quot;summon 
your psychic blades and come at me all out, all right?&quot;

The glowing katana&#39;s appeared in Elizabeth&#39;s hands, pure telekinetic 
energy as powerful as her will could make them. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; 
Elizabeth asked.

Kitty gave her a small wave, &quot;Lets&#39;s go.&quot;

&quot;You asked for it,&quot; Elizabeth answered, and charged, blades ready. In 
less time than it takes to tell she found herself laying flat on her 
back, Kitty&#39;s foot resting gently on her throat.

&quot;Lesson one,&quot; Kitty said, helping Elizabeth up to her feet, &quot;is that 
you rely on the blades too much. You haven&#39;t really worked them into 
your fighting style, either.&quot;

Elizabeth rubbed at her throat, giving Kitty an even more respectful 
look than she had before. She nodded a bit ruefully, &quot;You make that 
look so easy.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not, trust me,&quot; Kitty said with a grin. She looked Elizabeth 
over thoughtfully, adding, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be so out of breath, 
either.&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t been training as much, since we left the other X-teams,&quot; 
Psylocke admitted.

&quot;I guess we start with the basics,&quot; Kitty said thoughtfully, &quot;then 
we&#39;ll figure out a way for you to use those blades better.&quot; She turned 
to ask Rogue what she thought, and noticed her girlfriend had fallen 
back asleep in the deck chair.

Elizabeth and Kitty shared a impish smile, before each of them took 
one end of the deck chair and carried it over to the shoreline, just 
at the edge of the rising water. Kitty led Elizabeth off on a jog, and 
a few moments later they headed back, just as the water reached 
Rogue&#39;s feet.

Rogue woke up with an incoherent squawk as she was suddenly soaked to 
the waist by a playful wave. &quot;Pryde!&quot; she roared, getting to her feet. 
Kitty and Elizabeth stood together, catching their breaths from the 
run and laughing softly.
