<h1>Kitty and Illyana: A Tale of Magik! (part 13 of 25)</h1>

<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>        Nightcrawler smiled, the blue furred mutant leaping down from 
his perch on a coat-rack to offer them a grin after they finished making 
their big announcement. &quot;If you two are sure about this,&quot; Kurt said, 
&quot;then I&#39;m glad.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Kitty hugged him, her brown hair neatly pulled back.

        &quot;The kids are ready to go,&quot; Logan noted from where he sat by an 
open window, his cigar smoke drifting outside as the black haired 
warrior continued, &quot;and I&#39;m proud of &#39;em.&quot;

        &quot;Pretty cool,&quot; Rogue offered from where she was leaning up 
against the wall. &quot;Just don&#39;t get yourselves into too much trouble,&quot; she 
added, the streak of white in the middle of her redish brown hair 
catching the eye.

        &quot;We&#39;ll try,&quot; Illyanna gave her a slight smile. Rogue had been an 
enemy of the X-men for a long time, and the slim blonde found having her 
as an teammate was just a bit odd.

        Storm nodded from where she stood. There was a distinct sense of 
sadness about the African woman as she said, &quot;Like I told Kitty before, 
I hope you will be happy.&quot;

        Kitty hesitated as she looked over to the one who hadn&#39;t spoken 
up yet. Softly she said &quot;You&#39;ve been pretty quiet, Cyclops.&quot;

        &quot;As an X-Man,&quot; Cyclops said gravely, his brown hair falling into 
his glasses covered eyes, &quot;I&#39;m a bit upset. Both of you have powerful 
talents, ones I hate to loose.&quot; A slight smile, &quot;But as your friend, I 
want to wish you well.&quot;

        &quot;We will miss you,&quot; Charles Xavier said, hesitantly walking over 
to their side, &quot;but I&#39;m glad that you&#39;ve found the path you want to 
follow.&quot;

        &quot;We aren&#39;t dropping off the face of the earth, you know,&quot; 
Illyanna reminded them, &quot;we&#39;re just in New York City. You can visit us, 
and we can visit you.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not the same as being in the same house, little 
snowflake,&quot; Piotr reminded her gently. The black haired Russian looked 
over at Kitty, &quot;Take care of her, please.&quot;

        &quot;With my life,&quot; Kitty agreed.

        &quot;Coo,&quot; Lockheed the dragon murmured from the curve of Kitty&#39;s 
arms. He was coming back to the Sanctum with them, Kitty unwilling to 
just leave him at the mansion.

        There was a final round of hugs all around, then Kitty and 
Illyanna stood together in the center of the living-room. Illyanna 
focused her will, there was a shimmer of light.. a stepping disk 
appeared and they were gone.

        The study of the Sanctum appeared around them, and both young 
women sighed in relief. &quot;Home,&quot; Illyanna finally felt herself relaxing, 
a bit surprised at how tense she had been. She closed her eyes, feeling 
the mystic defenses, and was glad they were all still intact.

        &quot;Home,&quot; Kitty agreed, releasing the dragon tentatively. With a 
single sweep of his wings the small gray beast flew up, Lockheed 
circling around the room, but staying away from the shelves and all the 
small, breakable objects.

        &quot;Well, that&#39;s not bad,&quot; Illyanna watched him fly a moment. 
&quot;Maybe this is going to work out,&quot; she added thoughtfully.

        &quot;Let&#39;s hope,&quot; Kitty agreed.

        &quot;You want to get some dinner?&#39; Illyanna asked, only to chuckle 
softly as her lover&#39;s stomach grumbled softly. &quot;Dumb question,&quot; she 
laughed.

        &quot;You,&quot; Kitty poked her with a soft laugh. They left the study 
together, Lockheed dropping down to perch on Kitty&#39;s shoulder. They 
walked up the hall past the library, the dining room, then on to the 
kitchen itself.

        &quot;What would you like?&quot; Illyanna asked curiously.

        Kitty smiled wryly, &quot;To be honest, I think I&#39;d like something a 
bit trashy.&quot; She looked at Illyanna and asked, &quot;How about some burgers?&quot;

        &quot;Hmm,&quot; Illyanna mused thoughtfully, then she grinned over at her 
girlfriend, &quot;Why not? Burgers it is, please.&quot;

        Objects began to move around the kitchen on their own as the 
ghostly cook worked while Lockheed crouched down on Kitty&#39;s shoulder, 
watching the goings on warily. Ground beef patties on the hot stove, 
grilling four burgers efficiently even as lettuce, onion and tomato&#39;s 
were prepared for toppings. Hand baked buns were cut in half, and in 
moments a meal was ready, the left-over fried meat put in a bowl for 
Lockheed to eat.

        Kitty grinned as Lockheed sat on the kitchen table not far from 
their seats and scarfed down the food, &quot;That&#39;s the best way to get on 
Lockheed&#39;s good side.&quot;

        &quot;Mine, too,&quot; Illyanna sighed, eating her burger with much 
enjoyment while sitting across from Kitty. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she offered to 
the spirit with a gentle smile.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Kitty echoed, munching quite happily herself. There 
was an odd feeling in the air of the little kitchen, and if their cook 
still had a body Kitty rather suspected that there would be some 
blushing going on.

        &quot;Remind me to start exercising,&quot; Illyanna mused as she finished 
off her first burger, then moved on to the next. &quot;With this kind of 
food, I&#39;ll gain weight.&quot;

        Kitty stuck her tongue out, &quot;It&#39;s good food, and I think the 
magic burns enough energy to deal with it. From what I&#39;ve seen, Dr. 
Strange never gained weight.&quot;

        &quot;I hadn&#39;t really thought about it like that,&quot; Illyanna admitted. 
She took a generous bite of the burger, &quot;Though I noticed he looked 
healthier the last time we talked to him.&quot;

        Kitty snickered softly as she polished off the last of her other 
burger. &quot;That&#39;s because of Clea, I think,&quot; she agreed, wiping a bit of 
ketchup off her chin.

        &quot;I can understand that,&quot; Illyanna leaned forward, looking across 
the kitchen table, &quot;I know I feel better when I&#39;m around you.&quot;

        Kitty felt herself blushing, an honestly pleased smile on her 
face. &quot;You should be careful saying things like that,&quot; she said softly, 
&quot;you&#39;ll turn a girl&#39;s head.&quot;

        &quot;I hope so,&quot; Illyanna agreed, reaching across to lay her hand 
over Kitty&#39;s own. &quot;I&#39;ve been certainly trying,&quot; she added.

        Kitty took that hand in her own, drawing it up to her lips for a 
gentle kiss. She met the blonde&#39;s gaze, &quot;You&#39;ve spoiled me for anyone 
else.&quot;

        &quot;Humph,&quot; Lockheed made a soft noise, stalking away.

        Kitty chuckled softly, the two getting up from the table holding 
hands. They walked down the hallway past the study when Illyanna felt an 
odd sensation. Kitty hesitated, then Illyanna looked over at Kitty 
questioningly.

        Illyanna stopped outside the door, &quot;Did you feel that?&quot;

        Kitty nodded, a frown on her face. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she pushed open the 
study door, both of them walking into the room together. The Orb in the 
middle of the room glowed brightly, fire swirling about inside of it, 
almost like a bird.

        &quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot; Illyanna asked weakly.

        &quot;Phoenix,&quot; Kitty moved over to the Orb, looking into it 
cautiously. There was a feeling in the air, almost like static 
electricity, something that made the hair on your neck stand on end. 
&quot;Why would it manifest now?&quot; she looked over at Illyanna.

        A loud displacement of air, and both women looked up to see a 
figure falling from the ceiling. &quot;Look out,&quot; the redhead squawked as she 
dropped right on top of them.

        Whump!

        &quot;How on Earth,&quot; Illyanna struggled up, pulling Kitty to her feet 
before looking at the redheaded teen in shock, &quot;did she get in here?&quot;

        &quot;The defenses are still intact,&quot; Kitty checked quickly.

        &quot;Ah, hello,&quot; the redhead gave them a nervous smile, &quot;my name is 
Rachel Summers. I&#39;m sort of your apprentice from about twenty years in 
the future.&quot;

        Both women stood there, mildly dumbfounded. &quot;What?!&quot; both 
blurted.</pre>
