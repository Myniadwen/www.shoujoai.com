<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Allistaire Stuart watched with a certain amount of awe
as Kitty and Illyanna thanked the assembled magicians
then bid them farewell, the astral forms disappearing
one by one. &quot;Did you get the data you wanted?&quot;
Alysande asked from nearby, her uniform crisp and neat
as usual. Her eyes weren&#39;t focused on the departing
magicians, though, instead she looked towards where
Rachel and Phoenix were talking.

&quot;Reams of it,&quot; Allistaire answered her honestly,
&quot;we&#39;ll be analyzing it for weeks.&quot; He hesitated,
looking at her thoughtfully then bluntly asked, &quot;Are
you taken with this American?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Alysande blurted.

Allistaire gave his twin a wry smile. &quot;I know you
pretty well,&quot; he reminded her gently, &quot;besides, we
have similar tastes.&quot;

&quot;Well yes,&quot; Alysande acknowledged. Allistaire had been
trying to charm Rachel off and on, but the young woman
hadn&#39;t show all that much interest in him. She tried
not to be obvious watching Jean as she continued, &quot;But
I&#39;m needed here...&quot;

&quot;True enough, but,&quot; Allistaire raised a finger, an
impish smile on his face, &quot;I seem to recall you
haven&#39;t taken any vacation time in the last few
years.&quot;

&quot;Well we&#39;ve been busy,&quot; Alysande began to smile,
seeing where he was going.

&quot;I think you have several months saved up by now,&quot;
Allistaire said thoughtfully, &quot;and a vacation in
America would be quite the thing.&quot; A bit more
seriously he added, &quot;It would certainly give you the
chance to get to know her a bit better.&quot;

&quot;But would you be all right, Allistaire?&quot; Alysande
asked him softly.

&quot;I&#39;ll miss having a military liaison who knows me as
well as you do,&quot; Allistaire acknowledged, &quot;but I can
manage the administrative end all right. I should be
fine.&quot;

&quot;Now I have to try asking them,&quot; Alysande fretted
softly.

&quot;Courage,&quot; he encouraged her, Allistaire giving her a
gentle push forward.

Alysande walked over to Kitty and Illyanna, who were
saying good-bye to Jennifer Kale, the last of the
magicians to leave. &quot;Maybe we&#39;ll see each other at the
Witching Hour,&quot; the young blonde waved then Jennifer
faded away.

&quot;Alysande,&quot; Kitty smiled at her, the brown haired
magician giving her a curious look.

&quot;Are you planning to leave soon?&quot; Alysande asked
cautiously.

&quot;With the Anti-Phoenix dealt with we don&#39;t have much
reason to stick around,&quot; Illyanna said, the blonde
young woman looking mildly amused about something.

Alysande wasn&#39;t quite sure she liked Illyanna, in all
honestly. There was something mildly disquieting about
the girl, but it was more of a subtle undercurrent.
&quot;True enough,&quot; Alysande agreed, trying to think about
hot to bring up her request.

&quot;I was wondering,&quot; Kitty looked at Alysande with a
merry twinkle in her eye, &quot;has the Weird Happenings
Organization had much experience with magic?&quot;

&quot;Some,&quot; Alysande said cautiously.

&quot;We were thinking that the WHO could send a observer
along with us to the States,&quot; Illyanna stepped in
smoothly, &quot;but it would have to be someone already
familiar with us, and I think a woman might be best.&quot;

Alysande felt herself blush, realizing that both young
women knew of her interest and were interested in
helping. &quot;Do you have anyone in mind?&quot; she asked
casually.

Kitty wasn&#39;t fooled, of course. &quot;How would you like
the job, Colonel?&quot; she asked with a grin.

&quot;I&#39;d like that very much,&quot; Alysande agreed, &quot;just let
me grab my overnight bag.&quot;

Illyanna had to fight back a laugh as Alysande raced
off, a bounce to the older woman&#39;s steps. &quot;I&#39;m glad
that Phoenix is sticking around for awhile to train
Rachel in controlling the power of the baby-Phoenix,&quot;
she remarked.

&quot;She sure sounded glum about leaving England and
Alysande, I noticed,&quot; Kitty said, rubbing her hands
together gleefully.

&quot;You are such a matchmaker,&quot; Illyanna laughed.

Rachel quietly made her way over, leaving Jean alone
to look out on the water with a sad look on her face.
She smiled at her teachers wryly as the younger
redhead asked, &quot;What are we going to do about Jean and
Alysande?&quot; she asked.

Both Kitty and Illyanna looked at each other then they
began to laugh. &quot;So you noticed them, too?&quot; Kitty
asked.

&quot;Hard not to,&quot; Rachel said, &quot;it&#39;s like watching two
teenagers too scared to make the first move.&quot;

She frowned at them, &quot;So what&#39;s so funny?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s already been taken care of,&quot; Illyanna reassured
her, &quot;Alysande is accompanying us to the states as a
WHO observer.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Rachel chuckled, &quot;I think Jean was considering
doing something rash, otherwise.&quot;

Kitty had the sudden mental image of Jean slinging
Alysande over her shoulder and had to fight back a
laugh. &quot;I&#39;m glad that wasn&#39;t necessary.&quot;

Jean turned from watching the waters, frowning
slightly as she saw Kitty, Rachel and Illyanna
laughing together. She felt a certain amount of relief
at the defeat of the Anti-Phoenix, but more regret
that her time spent here was coming to an end so soon.
It was odd... she hadn&#39;t been so intrigued by someone
in a long time, and to know she probably wouldn&#39;t see
Alysande again hurt.

Alysande emerged from her tent with a bag slung over
her shoulder, her military cap straight and a smile on
her face. She strode over to Kitty and the others,
exchanged quiet words with them then walked over to
where the now nervous Jean waited.

&quot;Is the WHO breaking camp already?&quot; Jean asked her
quietly.

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Alysande set her bag down by her feet,
then took her cap off to run a hand through her brown
hair. &quot;I&#39;m going with you.&quot;

Jean blinked at her in surprise, feeling her
depression suddenly begin to lift. &quot;What?&quot; she asked,
wonder in her voice.

&quot;Technically I&#39;m observing for WHO,&quot; Alysande
explained.

&quot;And how long will this be?&quot; Jean asked her gently,
reaching out a bit hesitantly to take Alysande&#39;s hand.

With a warm smile Alysande squeezed those fingers,
&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve got several months vacation time saved up.&quot;


Jean and Alysande began to walk back towards where
Kitty, Illyanna and Rachel were standing close
together. &quot;And what do Kitty and Illyanna think of
this?&quot; Jean asked a bit warily.

&quot;They suggested it,&quot; Alysande said a bit wryly. She
and Jean exchanged a glance, both a bit amused at how
easy they were to read.

Allistaire joined them just as Jean and Alysande
reached the group. &quot;Remember to email me
occasionally,&quot; he reminded Alysande gently, &quot;I&#39;d worry
about you otherwise.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll remember,&quot; Alysande reassured him.

&quot;Thank you for all your help,&quot; Kitty shook his hand,
&quot;it&#39;s been good to meet you.&quot;

&quot;No, thank you,&quot; Allistaire grinned back, &quot;our
observations from this event will keep us busy for
months, at least.&quot;

&quot;Typical scientist,&quot; Rachel laughed. Dropping her
voice she added to him alone, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I have a
girlfriend back home.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Allistaire shrugged with a smile.

&quot;Best get your sensors ready,&quot; Illyanna said impishly,
&quot;you&#39;re in for another show.&quot;

Even as a few WHO techs held out monitors Illyanna
summoned a stepping disk, the silvery energy construct
sweeping over the group and teleporting them away.
&quot;Incredible,&quot; Allistaire Stuart smiled wryly, turning
away to guide his techs in packing their gear away.

Meanwhile in the Sanctum the group appeared...

... just as the alarms warning of an attacker went
off. &quot;Now what?&quot; Kitty grumbled.

&quot;Outside,&quot; Illyanna said, leading the race over to a
window.

Guardian creatures had been automatically manifested
to protect the sanctum from physical attack, but the
woman outside was making short work of them. Her brown
hair was short, matching the simple brown and gold
bodysuit she wore, and shockingly twin metallic claws
extended from the back of each hand.

&quot;Jane?&quot; Rachel exclaimed in shock.

&quot;Who!&quot; everyone looked at Rachel.</pre>
