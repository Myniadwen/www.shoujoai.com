<h1>Grand Theft Colo: Just Another Day</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Gunfire rang out in the streets of Tokyo, but then
again, there was always guns going off there
somewhere. Piroko leaned around the corner they were
taking cover behind, her gothic lolita clothes
swirling around her as the blonde calmly fired at
their opponents.

&quot;Give it up, you little hos!&quot; Fro-daddy Largoshin
yelled, his massive afro and seventies clothes making
him stand out in the mad Shinjuku mob. Still, despite
his foolish looks he used his pistols like a pro,
helping keep them pinned down.

&quot;You know, Sugardrop&quot; Himiko noted mildly as she
brought her Benelli up and fired from her spot beside
Piroko, &quot;They&#39;re actually beginning to annoy me.&quot;

&quot;They did that to me a while ago,&quot; Piroko said dryly.

&quot;Hey Lollipop, wanna come play?&quot; Pimp Dom welled, his
black hair styled in a rediculous looking pompadour.

&quot;No,&quot; Piroko leaned over to take a few more shots,
wishing he&#39;d stick his head above cover for just a
moment.

&quot;Which one do you want, then? Largo or Dom?&quot; Himiko
asked calmly.

&quot;I get to pick?&quot; a slight smile teased Piroko&#39;s lips.

&quot;I always take care of my girls,&quot; Himiko answered
softly as she reached out to stroke Piroko&#39;s fair
white skin.

Piroko smiled, &quot;Largoshin, then.&quot; Her eyes narrowed a
bit, &quot;He still owes me for losing the server
Makoto-rin.&quot;

Himiko reloaded as she rose, her tight skirt hugging
her hips as she purred, &quot;Then let&#39;s do this.&quot; Little
jacket flapping as she moved she and Piroko burst from
cover, both laying down suppression fire as the few
innocent bystanders raced to safety.

The streets of Shinjuku are a crazy place, one where
the only law is maintained by a gun and the strength
to stand up for yourself. Rival gangs roamed the
streets freely, staking out their territories and
watching out for their own and unleashing bloody
vengeance on those that dared to cross them.

Oince upon a time Fro-daddy Largoshin had attempted to
steal a valuable server named Makoto-rin, then
foolishly ventured through Himiko&#39;s territory. Making
a snap decision she and Piroko had attempted to
liberate Makoto-rin for themselves, but Fro-daddy
Largoshin had proved a more dangerous opponent than
expected and the server escaped.

&quot;Yo, wait just a mo, babe,&quot; Fro-daddy Largoshin said
weakly a few minutes later, his exo-armor a smoking
ruin and his famous fro ruined.

&quot;Payback&#39;s a bitch, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Piroko said as she
fired, capping him in the head with a ruthless sort of
efficiency.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Himiko gleefully fired as Dom
tried to crawl away from her, splattering the street
with red blood. Looking up she sweetly asked her
partner, &quot;You done with yours, hon?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, he&#39;s down for now,&quot; Piroko agreed as both women
walked away from the bloody scene, the onlookers
gazing at them with fear and rspect.

Of course, Fro-daddy Largoshin and Pimp Dom would both
be back eventually, the respawn points set all around
the city would see to that. However a temporary death
was enough to satisfy both women, at least for now.

&quot;You got splattered again,&quot; Himiko noted
disapprovingly as they strode away, soon disappearing
into the crowded streets.

&quot;I know,&quot; Piroko smiled slightly as she note the blood
staining her dress so artistically, &quot;but I rather like
it.&quot;

&quot;It does look good on you,&quot; Himiko agreed, drawing the
girl close in a one armed hug, brushing her lips
across Piroko&#39;s cheek.

As they passed the street corners certain girls would
nod respectfully, members of Himeko&#39;s network of
girls. Some were street walkers, others runners for
the bookies in the neighborhood, others running the
gambling parlors and brothels, but all of these ladies
answered to Himeko and her partner Piroko.

&quot;Hey, you two!&quot; A voice called, &quot;Hold it right there!&quot;

&quot;You want me to...?&quot; Piroko covertly went for her
pistol as they turned towards the direction the voices
were coming from.

&quot;No,&quot; Himiko put a steadying hand on her arm, &quot;I think
our friends are just here for their weekly bribe.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d still like to shoot them,&quot; Piroko murmured
coldly.

Erica Hayasaka was a police lieutenant, high enough in
rank that the tall, brown haired woman had learned
exactly how the world really worked. She along with
her young protege Yuki were the law here in Shinjuku,
however little there actually was, and the local
criminals all knew to keep her happy.

&quot;Been busy I hear,&quot; Erika noted, the taller woman
looking down at them both with a slight smile on her
face.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yuki noted, a pice of straw dangling from
between her lips as she crossed her arms in front of
her in a confrontational way.

&quot;Just a little discussion,&quot; Himeko waved it off.

Yuki snorted loudly. A faint smile tugged at Erika&#39;s
lips, &quot;I doubt Fro-daddy Largoshin would describe it
that way.&quot;

Piroko&#39;s eyes narrowed dangerously, &quot;Oh?&quot;

Yuki made a soft fearful noise, quickly moving to hide
behind Erika. Everyone knew about the deadly enforcer
Piroko, about her fatal temper and nearly perfect kill
record. If she decided you were dead you would die, it
was all just a matter of time.

Erika just smiled, her own rep on these streets nearly
as good as Piroko&#39;s. &quot;You did good work,&quot; she noted,
&quot;the Fro-daddy has had that coming for awhile.&quot;

Himiko smiled in her most charming way as she asked,
&quot;So what can we do for you on this fine day?&quot;

In a almost self mocking way Erika said, &quot;Well, we&#39;re
collecting money for the police benevolence fund...&quot;

&quot;The customary amount?&quot; Himiko asked as she drew out a
envelope from a pocket in her stylish dress jacket.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Erika took it and calmly tucked it away
into her uniform. Noting that Piroko had moved off a
bit, watching their surroundings she asked, &quot;Does
Piroko... ever do work like your other girls?&quot;

&quot;You mean as a date?&quot; Himiko asked, a smile teasing
her lips. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have thought she was your type.&quot;

&quot;She isn&#39;t my usual type,&quot; Erika admitted quietly,
&quot;but there&#39;s... something about her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll ask her,&quot; Himiko shrugged, &quot;I can&#39;t promise
anything.&quot;

&quot;Good enough,&quot; Erika said as she collected her mildly
stunned partner and headed off.

Piroko returned to her side in a soft rustle of black
skirts. &quot;What was that about?&quot; she asked as they set
off once more.

&quot;Erika would like for me to arrange a date with you,&quot;
Himiko noted with barely concealed amusement.

Piroko raised a single eyebrow, &quot;Not interested.&quot;

&quot;She is attractive,&quot; Himiko noted as they moved
through the crowds.

Piroko shrugged slightly as she answered, &quot;There&#39;s
only one woman I&#39;m interested in, and that&#39;s you.&quot;

Himiko drew them aside from the crush, the two women
standing at the mouth of an alley. She stroked
Piroko&#39;s hair tenderly as she drew her close, &quot;Me
too.&quot; The kiss that followed was both tender and
lingering, promising later passion.

&quot;I knew I&#39;d find you too somewhere around here,&quot;
Fro-daddy Largoshin growled as he staggered out of the
crowd.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t know when to quit does he?&quot; Himiko asked as
she drew her benelli.

&quot;Nope,&quot; Piroko drew her own pistol, both women ready
to fire.

BLAM!

Piroko, Himiko and Erika, more or less, and all drawn
