xXxXxXxXx



&quot;Ah!&quot;

Terra let out a scream as she ran as fast as she could away from the 
falling rocks she had attempted to keep levitated over her head.  Her 
powers had erupted, and the sudden lack of concentration forced the 
large pieces of earth to fall from the skies, and directly toward her.  
She dove at the last second, barely avoiding a near-death experience.  
As large amounts of dust clouds picked up all around her, she punched at 
her very element, pounding against the Earth she laid upon.

&quot;Why can&#39;t I do this?&quot;  Terra cried out in frustration.  She had spent 
nearly a week away from the tower, and she hated it.  Never had she felt 
this way about anywhere she had been.  From town to town, from city to 
city she had gone and left without a trace after her powers had caused 
problems, or she simply became bored with her life there.  She could 
literally feel the pain from disclosing the voices in her mind that 
urged her to return to her home.  She wanted to learn to control her 
powers first, then ... maybe ...

&quot;It is because you lack concentration, my sweet Tara,&quot; a sudden voice 
echoed from above.  Tearful eyes, which she hadn&#39;t even noticed looked 
up to the mountainside to where the mercenary was perched, glaring down 
upon her.

&quot;Slade...&quot; Terra let out with a frown, a look of determination set upon 
her.  How did this man know who she really was?  Hell, she didn&#39;t even 
know who she really was!

&quot;How is it you know that name?&quot;  Terra demanded to know, unable to back 
down from him like she had before.

&quot;I know all about you, Tara Markov,&quot; Slade stated as he leaped down from 
the mountain, landing twelve meters away from her.  &quot;I know about the 
experimentation in Gotham ... I know about the path you took in order to 
get here.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;  Terra asked as she took a hesitant step back, though kept up her 
tough pretense.  &quot;Why me?  Why do you know so much about me?  What can 
be so interesting about me?&quot;

&quot;Your powers, Tara,&quot; Slade stated emotionlessly as he continued a slow 
pace toward her.  &quot;You are very unique, as I have said before.  A 
diamond that needs a little ... shaping.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s you that needs a little shaping,&quot; Terra yelled out while 
surrounding her hands in a yellow glow.  She forced her arms outward, 
while the very ground the mercenary stood on crumbled.  Slade leaped off 
the rock a few yards back, crouching down as Terra sent several rocks in 
his direction.

&quot;Lesson number one,&quot;  the mercenary&#39;s voice became slightly louder like 
a teacher would to emphasize his point.  &quot;Never attack based on your 
emotions.&quot;

With a quick reach to his back he pulled out his metallic bo-staff, 
extending it outward and swinging through several pieces of stone.  The 
staff spiraled around his form, completely shattering any and every rock 
that aimed to harm.  Terra took a step back while Slade advanced 
forward, hurling stone after stone while the mercenary deflected each 
attack.  

&quot;Lesson number two,&quot; Slade began to say as he neared closer toward her.

&quot;I don&#39;t need lessons from you!&quot;  Terra shouted as a bright yellow aura 
erupted around her.  The very earth Slade stood upon suddenly crack and 
crumbled, forcing him to leap high into the air.

&quot;Use your opponents weakness against them,&quot; he shouted from the air as 
he hurled several disks outward.  With a quick lifting of her arms, 
Terra shielded herself from the attack, forcing the disks to explode 
against the raised earth.  The blast hurled Terra back a few yards and 
onto her back, with Slade once again walking up confidently beside her.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter, little elementalist,&quot; Slade asked in a low tone 
while leaning down toward the blonde.  &quot;Were you not strong enough to 
help fight along side your fellow teammates?  Or did personal issues 
force you to run, like you always do...&quot;

Terra let out a grunt, then a scream as she turned toward the mercenary, 
lifting a portion of rock behind her, surrounded in a yellow hue and 
hurled it in his direction, two which he easily sidestepped.  The blonde 
forced herself to her feet and ran straight for Slade, arms cocked back 
and swirling with a golden yellow energy.  Her sapphire hues were filled 
with rage as she launched punch after punch, each one being dodged or 
easily swatted away by the man&#39;s pole.  Terra dropped to the ground, 
barely avoiding a roundhouse and quickly lifted the earth behind her, 
smacking into Slade&#39;s chest and sending him several yards back.

&quot;Hah!&quot;  Terra cried out confidently after a few intakes of breath.  
Sweat poured off her form, but she was at least glad to have made one 
hit on her enemy.  &quot;Take that, you son of a-&quot;

The side of her head was struck by the instep of Slade&#39;s boot, the man 
having to move like quicksilver while the dust had collected where he 
landed and coming up from the girl&#39;s side, striking while she celebrated 
her hit.

&quot;Lesson number two,&quot; Slade began to repeat.  &quot;Never drop your guard even 
when your enemy is down.&quot;

Terra began to lift herself from the ground, her body trembling in both 
exhaustion from her earlier attempts to control her powers, and the 
excessive training Slade forced upon her.  The man&#39;s index finger began 
to lift up the girl&#39;s chin, while blonde strands covered the left side 
of her face.  Slade&#39;s one eye stared into Terra&#39;s own, seeming to enjoy 
the look of fear he placed in her.

&quot;Why is it you chose to fight me?&quot;  Slade asked curiously as he dropped 
his grip from the girl and straightened his back.  &quot;Do you not seek 
information of your past?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care about my past,&quot; Terra was quick to shout as she pulled 
herself to her knees.  &quot;You say you know so much about me, I&#39;d assume 
you&#39;d be the first to know the reasons why I run all the time.&quot;

Conversation.  Slade smirked.  Yes, the girl was indeed opening up to 
him now.

&quot;Because no one understands you, Terra,&quot; Slade stated, referring to the 
girl by the name she chose.  He placed his hands behind his back while 
the girl attempted to catch her breath, walking circles around her while 
he continued.  &quot;You attempt to do good, to prove that you are not a 
complete screw up.  But your powers are far superior than your own 
strength.  You need to learn your limitations, and you need to learn 
control.  You rely too much on your own powers and not enough upon 
yourself.&quot;

Terra&#39;s shoulders slumped as the man&#39;s words began to sink in.

&quot;When things go wrong, others immediately place the blame upon you, but 
it&#39;s always easier to point fingers rather than accept responsibility,&quot; 
Slade continued on as he now stood face to face with the girl who now 
sat resting an arm on one knee.  &quot;When you begin to take responsibility 
for your actions, when you learn to control your powers, will you stop 
running?&quot;

Terra thought long and hard about the question her supposed enemy 
announced to her, her brows lowering while her eyes focused upon the 
ground.  So many people had been hurt because of her inability to 
control her powers, so many lives had been lost.  How long was she 
supposed to keep running for?  How much longer before she ran into a 
dead end?

&quot;You&#39;re an adventurer, Terra,&quot; Slade interrupted the girl&#39;s thoughts 
before she had time to answer his question.  &quot;You run recklessly through 
life, burning the bridges you cross in hopes that no one will follow, 
but what will happen when you attempt to return to those bridges?&quot;

She had been on her own for so long, she couldn&#39;t remember exactly where 
she was from, where it had all started.  Her eyes closed as tears built, 
fighting to keep herself calm.  She couldn&#39;t break now, especially in 
front of him.

&quot;How many more lives must you destroy before you realize you can&#39;t learn 
to control your powers on your own?&quot;  Slade asked, his voice more harsh 
but quickly calmed as he knelt down to become eye level with the girl.  
He placed his index finger upon her chin once again, lifting her head up 
to look her in the eye.  They slowly opened, misty and attempting to 
shield her emotions.  &quot;I&#39;m offering you the chance to never have to run 
again, Terra.  No more bridges will be burned, and no more fingers will 
be pointed in your direction.  Train as my apprentice, and I shall show 
you to control your powers.  All that I ask in return is your trust.&quot;



xXxXxXxXx 



In mid-leap and with a fierce growl, Robin swung his fist back passed 
his head and swung hard at the flying volleyball, sending it soaring 
through the air, clear over the net toward Cyborg and Starfire on the 
other side.  A metal-handed pump sent the ball back up, with Starfire 
quickly taking action next, bouncing the ball back to the other side.  A 
green skinned kangaroo was waiting, however, quickly kicking it back 
hard.  Starfire was first to take initiative, delivering a killer spike.

&quot;Az&#39;rath, Metrion, Xinthos ... Az&#39;rath, Metrion, Xinthos ...&quot; Raven 
continued to chant.  It had been a few weeks after Terra had left them, 
and Raven couldn&#39;t fill in the empty feeling in the pit of her stomach.  
Perhaps if she had tried more to get the girl to stay ... maybe if she 
had ... she quickly buried such thoughts.  She was attempting to 
meditate, to clear her mind of such thoughts in order to become more 
focused upon her emotions and the source of her own powers, not to 
reflect upon the past.

In attempt to save, Robin jumped up, barely in enough time to send up 
flying upward toward the net, setting up for a perfect spike for either 
team.  Cyborg quickly rushes in for the follow up, with the ball 
descends toward the net.  As the big man gets ready to spike, however, 
he finds himself facing an even bigger green gorilla with the same idea 
in mind.  Beast Boy prevails, and smashes the ball passed both members 
of the opposition, hurling it straight toward the back of Raven&#39;s head.  
An instant after he comes down from his jump, he resumed his human form 
and began to panic.

&quot;Raven, heads up!&quot;

The ball continued its flight, but stopped dead an inch short of the 
sorceress&#39; cranium, thanks to an annoyed glance and a bit of 
telekinesis.  A lowered brow would rocket the ball back toward the 
players, smashing directly into the changeling&#39;s face, while she resumed 
her meditation.

&quot;Yow!&quot;  Beast Boy exclaimed, while grasping his bruised nose.  &quot;Thanks, 
uh ... good save.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to play, Raven?&quot;  Robin shifted his worried 
view from Beast Boy to Raven, who had remained in even further solitude 
than he was normally used to.

&quot;Yes, please, you must volley the ball with us!&quot;  Koriand&#39;r always had a 
way with words, Raven mused.  It was enough to force out a light 
chuckle, though not enough to pull her from her meditation.

&quot;Come on!&quot;  Cyborg called out to the girl, while pulling his left arm 
behind his back, and waving his right.  &quot;I&#39;ll play you with one hand 
behind my back.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; Raven admitted truthfully.  &quot;I have to meditate.&quot;

Shrugs all around, after which Cyborg pulled his left arm back out.  The 
team quickly resumed play, with a gorilla Beast Boy smashing the ball 
right back into play.  After over-pounding it again, the changeling 
reverts back to his human form, shouting out to the sorceress yet again.

&quot;Heads up, again!&quot;

The ball seemed like a magnet to Raven&#39;s head, traveling at great speed 
as before.  This time, however, the girl chose not to stop it and 
instead, floated to one side, letting it continue toward the edge.  The 
rest of the team all shouted out simultaneously.

&quot;Oh, no!&quot;

The ball soared over the tower&#39;s roof, and plummeted toward the rocks of 
the shore, bouncing from rock to rock until it came to a stop inside a 
crevice, preventing it from reaching the waters.

&quot;I&#39;ll get it,&quot; Beast Boy volunteered while the others groaned.  The 
changeling trudged toward the edge, attempting to peer over but is 
suddenly stopped by the reappearance of the ball, sailing its way back 
from below to roll across the concrete and stop right at his feet.  
Blinking in confusion, he searched around with a puzzled look, while 
something begins to rumble from down below.  His eyes shifted upward to 
a slender silhouette, rising into view with long hair blowing in the 
breeze, and hands upon hips, standing upon a floating object.

&quot;So,&quot; the female voice rose from the shadowed figure, moving the object 
that now could easily be seen as a rock toward the team.  With a 
half-smile perched upon her lips.  &quot;Which team am I on?&quot;

Clad in a pair of denim shorts, and her traditional hiking boots, rising 
up to a new black crop-top turtleneck, with long sleeves and a 
yellow-orange Titan insignia on the chest, the same leather gloves, a 
matching belt, and a new pair of goggles around her neck, the girl 
tossed her hair back, viewing the team she had left.

&quot;Terra!&quot;  Raven turned to view the shout that erupted from both Starfire 
and Beast Boy, witnessing them run like children toward the girl.  Like 
a war, the two fought to reach her fist.  In the end, it was the 
Tamaranian&#39;s Starbolts that stopped the changeling dead in his tracks, 
resulting in a devastating, and bone-crushing hug for the blonde haired 
elementalist.  She quickly buried her emotions, reverting back to her 
old self.  What, did she just expect to come back, and everything would 
be okay, like nothing ever happened?  A light conversation followed that 
Raven herself found no interest in, until Beast Boy shouted in her 
direction.

&quot;Raven, wake up!  Terra&#39;s back!  Isn&#39;t that awesome?&quot;

&quot;Super,&quot; Raven&#39;s voice became suddenly sarcastic.  &quot;Just help yourself 
to the fridge, and don&#39;t forget to lock the door when you leave.&quot;

She hadn&#39;t meant for her voice to sound so cold and distant, but she 
suddenly couldn&#39;t help her emotions from showing.  Had she truly been 
that hurt from her departure to treat the girl in such a cold way?  
True, she herself was never one to be the happy or welcoming type, but 
she did feel slightly better knowing the girl was back, and well.  Raven 
hoped that the rest of the day would hopefully leave her to meditate 
more, and express less of her emotions.  How quickly her hopes would be 
dropped.



xXxXxXxXx



&quot;No!&quot;  Raven quickly cried out, as she threw her arms, preventing the 
rock that Terra had summoned to smash the very console computer that 
could have stopped the tower from sinking into the ground.  Later that 
day, Slade had appeared and attempted to destroy Titan&#39;s Tower by 
literally pulling out the rock from underneath it.  Snake-like machines 
coursed through the bottom of the city, and made tunnels directly 
underneath Titan&#39;s Tower, with a giant drill attempting to dig its way 
above ground.  The result of which would aid in the falling of the 
tower, unless Raven stopped the very console that could stop it from 
being smashed.

&quot;We don&#39;t know how this thing words.  Destroy the controls, and we might 
never be able to stop it,&quot; Raven quickly shouted to the girl, keeping 
her hold over the rock Terra attempted to bring down.

&quot;Or we might stop it sooner and save our home,&quot; Terra sighed, putting 
more effort into trying to move the weight on one end.  Raven increases 
her own resistance and small fragments being to fall around them as a 
result of the strain.  &quot;Why can&#39;t you just trust me?&quot;

&quot;Because you don&#39;t deserve it!&quot;  Raven spat out, her emotions suddenly 
rising as a result of lack of meditation.  &quot;I have to meditate every day 
to keep my powers under control.  And I&#39;m supposed to believe that you 
can just suddenly control yours?   Trust is something you have to earn!&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;  Terra asked, her eyes softening lightly.  &quot;How do I earn it?&quot;

&quot;You can start by trusting me,&quot; she stated firmly, bolding the last part 
to the fullest.  Terra debated nearly nine to ten times within the span 
of a second, before relaxing her hold over the stone.  Raven did 
likewise, and allowed it crash upon the walkway.  A sudden violent shake 
would have the cutting laser slice through a large portion of rock from 
the ceiling, forcing the girls to look up, and then back toward the 
beeping console, which blinked out an alarm.  A second later, the 
gigantic piece of stone fell from above, and crushed the console upon 
impact.  Sparks fly out from everywhere while the girls were thrown 
backward.  The consequence of the console&#39;s destruction resulted in an 
even wider beam from the drill, cutting even more rock from beneath the 
tower.  Both girls rose to their feet, with Terra smiling nervously.

&quot;Okay, maybe smashing the computer was a bad idea,&quot; she agreed, while 
another large portion of rock began to fall.  An even larger mass of 
rock began to fall, right where the drill was located, which was the 
very foundation of the tower.

&quot;We have to go,&quot; Raven quickly shouted, turning toward the nearest exit.  
&quot;There&#39;s nothing we can do now!&quot;

&quot;Yes there is,&quot; Terra argued, while her eyes glowed brightly.  &quot;Trust 
me!&quot;

Down it came.  With her hands clenched tightly, Terra threw her hands 
upward, and with a shout, brought twin beams from her hands to shoo 
upward, toward the falling rock, halting in its tracks.  The girl 
struggled against the weight, and soon it became too much, beginning to 
drop once again.  Her knees began to buckle, just as Raven stepped up 
next to her with both her hands loaded for bear.

&quot;Az&#39;rath, Metrion, Xinthos!&quot;

A black beam of energy followed Terra&#39;s yellow light, forcing the rock 
to stop once again from falling.  Terra finally straightened herself, 
feeling the pressure equally divided between them.  Terra spared a 
glance to the sorceress of Azarath, whom merely looked up to her target, 
driven by determination.  Her serious look made the girl smile as she 
turned her focus back onto the rock.  With another cry, the two let 
loose their powers, forcing the rock as well as their home right back 
into place.



xXxXxXxXx



&quot;So,&quot; Terra said, while her eyes remained upon the carpet.  Terra had 
spent the night on the couch again, and when it came time to sleep for 
the next day, Raven had suggested the two go for a walk so they could 
converse.  They had kept relatively quiet since their little argument 
the day before, but for some reason, Terra felt rather comfortable 
around the silent sorceress.  She felt that the sorceress herself also 
enjoyed the silence, since she herself rarely spoke.  &quot;Friends?&quot;

&quot;Close enough,&quot; Raven relayed with rye humor, to which Terra was well 
accustomed.  The girl let out a hesitant smile, throwing a hand behind 
her head.

&quot;Sorry we got off to a rocky start,&quot; she apologized, not intending in 
the pun.  She noted the girl&#39;s light snicker, and her smile grew 
slightly.

&quot;Actually, I thought things went pretty well,&quot; Raven admitted honestly, 
the two having walked nearly the length of the tower to the other end of 
the hallway, passed all the rooms of the towers occupants, toward a part 
of the tower which Terra had never been.  &quot;It took me a year to stop 
hating Beast Boy.&quot;

The two shared a laugh, another feeling of comfort filling over them.  
Raven&#39;s light chuckle, and Terra&#39;s giggle seemed to mesh well with one 
another.  Raven came to a stop in front of a door, forcing Terra to do 
like wise.  While her cloak parted, the sorceress&#39; hand was placed upon 
the a side panel console, a green light beeping twice before the door 
opened, revealing a dark and shadowed room.

&quot;Um,&quot; Terra was slightly confused to where Raven had begun to take her, 
but followed nonetheless, only assuming that she had wanted to talk with 
her.  The actual lack of conversation proved that there was something 
else the sorceress had planned for her, and she couldn&#39;t help but be 
curious to what it was.  &quot;Where are we?&quot;

&quot;Your room,&quot; Raven said flatly, while flipping the light-switch on.  
Terra&#39;s eyes widened in amazement to the mountain landscape under a 
starry night sky painted all across the walls of the room.  A big green 
bed at the far end of the wall, a cactus next to it, bookshelves, a 
large couch, and a coffee table facing the window.  Inside held the rest 
of the Titans Team, Raven feeling the need to be the one to lead the 
girl to her new home.

&quot;Surprise!&quot;  The Titan&#39;s team quickly shouted.  Terra finally found her 
voice, taking a cautious step forward.

&quot;You guys did all this ... for me?&quot;  She couldn&#39;t believe it.  She had 
expected maybe a simple room if and when they decided to take her it, 
but this ... this was just too much.

&quot;Yea,&quot; Beast Boy nodded while sliding to her, blushing lightly and 
cocking his eyebrows.  &quot;Since you helped save our home and all, we 
thought you deserved your own room.&quot;

&quot;You also deserve one of these,&quot; Robin&#39;s voice came up as, for the 
second time, he opened his closed glove, which held the Titans 
Communicator Terra had dropped in their first attempts to get her to 
join.  Hesitant at first, Terra took the communicator, and this time 
held onto it tightly while looking wonderingly down at it in her palm.

&quot;So, I&#39;m ...&quot; Terra started, as she turned up to view the face of her 
new friends.

&quot;A Teen Titan,&quot; Robin confirmed, holding out his hand in commemoration 
to the girl.  &quot;Glad to have you on the team.&quot;  Terra smiled wearily, and 
shook the team leader&#39;s hand with a firm hold. 

&quot;Aw yeah!  Very nice!&quot;  Cyborg shouted, raising his hand in triumph.

&quot;This is the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to me,&quot; Beast Boy blushed, 
with hearts erupting from his eyes.

&quot;Welcome, new Titan!&quot; Starfire exclaimed, clapping her hands to the 
joyous occasion.

&quot;Congratulations, Terra,&quot; Raven half smirked, arching a brow to the 
rather ... selfish changeling.  She let a smile play out on her lips 
while turning to the girl.  &quot;You&#39;ve earned it.&quot;

Their newest teammate gave her a gratified smile, one to which Raven 
enjoyed, and looked forward to seeing more of.

&quot;All right,&quot; Cyborg quickly shouted, gathering the team&#39;s attention.  
&quot;There&#39;s only one way to commemorate such a momentous occasion ... 
Waffles!&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Robin grinned while rubbing his growling stomach at the mention 
of food, the team quickly following the half-metal teen toward the 
kitchen.

&quot;Perfect,&quot; Starfire&#39;s voice could be heard from the hallway, which Beast 
Boy&#39;s own followed suit.

&quot;Can they be non-dairy waffles?&quot;  Terra half smiled at the changeling&#39;s 
constant antics toward anything containing meat or dairy.

&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Terra announced with her back to the group, viewing the 
art before her.  &quot;I&#39;ll catch up in a minute, okay?&quot;

&quot;Everything alright?&quot;  Came the voice of the sorceress behind her, who 
had yet to leave for their late breakfast.

&quot;Yea, everything&#39;s fine,&quot; Terra was quick to answer, which Raven half 
caught as a lie, or simply due to her amazement of the room.  &quot;Who 
painted it?&quot;

Terra turned when the sorceress hadn&#39;t answered, parting the cloak that 
she had kept closed the entire time.  Yellow, brown, white, and orange 
clashed at her once black leotard; her hands must having been cleaned 
since the incident.

&quot;I&#39;ll have you know I ruined a nice set of clothes just for you,&quot; Raven 
relayed with the same humor once again, to which Terra couldn&#39;t help but 
smile over.  The girl retracted her hands, allowing her cloak to shadow 
over the mess underneath.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Terra nodded her head to the girl.  &quot;It&#39;s beautiful.  I 
can&#39;t believe you, of all people, painted this.&quot;

&quot;What is it you&#39;re getting at?&quot;  The sorceress quirked a brow in slight 
amusement, while Terra threw her hands out in her own defense, fearing 
the wrath of Raven.

&quot;No-no-no!&quot;  She quickly shouted, shaking her head quickly.  &quot;I only 
meant I didn&#39;t really expect you to be the one to put so much effort 
into your work ... wait, no.  I didn&#39;t mean it to sound like you don&#39;t 
put effort into anything, I just meant I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d-&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Raven quickly raised a hand, interrupting the 
girl&#39;s stumbling of words.  &quot;And you&#39;re welcome.  I just so happen to 
enjoy art.&quot;

With that, Raven turned toward the kitchen, where already a fight seemed 
to ensue.  Terra remained focused upon the wall, still baffled by the 
sheer brilliance of art and likeness to her favorite scenery.  

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it,&quot; Terra gapped after a few moments, letting her view 
drop slightly with a look of guilt expressed upon her features.  &quot;They 
actually trust me.&quot;



xXxXxXxXx



&quot;Az&#39;rath, Metrion, Xinthos ... Az&#39;rath, Metrion, Xinth-&quot;

&quot;Does that really help you control your powers?&quot;  Terra&#39;s voice 
interrupted the sorceress in mid chant.  From the living room she 
hovered, facing the ocean, and the starlit sky.  Robin had asked 
Starfire out on a date for the first time, which slightly irritated the 
sorceress.  She had planned to spend the day with Koriand&#39;r, learning of 
her heritage, after their meditation session.  Now it seemed out of her 
excitement, the Princess simply forgot of their plans and agreed to 
Robin&#39;s proposal, which left her feeling alone in the process.  With 
Beast Boy and Cyborg checking out a new arcade, it left Terra and Raven 
alone in the tower, the blonde&#39;s constant child-like attitude to lead 
toward boredom when nothing of interest was placed upon the television.

&quot;Yes, it does,&quot; Raven relayed dryly while her eyes remained closed, 
keeping her monotone-like appearance.  Silence followed, and before 
Raven could attempt to continue, Terra&#39;s voice woke her once again.

&quot;Think you could teach me to meditate?&quot;  This broke Raven from her 
half-dead trance, arching one eye to half-lid, eyeing the girl&#39;s bright 
sapphire eyes, which held the boredom that melded in her tone of voice.  
A half smirk rose upon her lips, and Raven turned her cross-legged 
stance toward her, nodding her head.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Raven replied.  Perhaps this wasn&#39;t going to be such a bad night 
after all.  



xXxXxXxXx



&quot;This is how I clear my head,&quot; Terra stated later that night, while the 
two were laid upon the top of Titan&#39;s tower, viewing the brightly lit 
sky.  They were perpendicular to each other, heads lying inches from 
each other while their bodies stretched in opposing directions.  The 
stars were bright, and clashed well against their midnight blue 
background.  Lying next to one another, both holding their heads in 
their palms, each focused their view upward, while sharing a moment of 
silent conversation.

&quot;I could get used to this,&quot; Raven admitted with new trademark 
half-smirk, one of which Terra noticed had begun to rise more upon 
occasion.  Content and comfortable sighs were released by the women, 
with another moment of silence falling over them.

&quot;Raven?&quot;  Another clash against the silence, but Raven didn&#39;t mind in 
the least.  She was beginning to learn that too much silence could be a 
bad thing.  She let out a light &#39;hmm&#39; before Terra continued her 
question.  &quot;What do you think of Beast Boy?&quot;

She let out a light chuckle, which later ensued an eruption of laughter.  
She didn&#39;t know why she had felt the question humorous but quite 
frankly, she couldn&#39;t help herself from laughing.  It sounded as if she 
were asking if she had feelings toward the boy.

&quot;He&#39;s good for a laugh,&quot; Raven admitted, meaning more toward his 
klutz-like antics than his actual humor.  &quot;Bad at jokes, but a good 
friend all around.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Terra seemed to take in the answer for only a second before 
asking another.  &quot;And what about you and Starfire?&quot;

&quot;Koriand&#39;r?&quot;  Raven had to pause in order to answer, for she herself 
never really thought about it.  Sure, the girl was her closest companion 
among all the Titan members, and sure, she was more than simply 
distraught over the fact that she had simply abandoned her at the tower 
to go on a date with their leader.  She frowned at the thought.  It 
seemed once again she ran second to her leader upon the Tamaranian&#39;s 
list.

&quot;Raven?&quot;  Realization hit her, which she had yet to respond to the girl.

&quot;She&#39;s a close friend,&quot; Raven felt herself relay without hesitation, 
more out of reflex than anything else.

&quot;Just a close friend?&quot;  Terra noted the change in tone over the girl&#39;s 
voice, knowing she wasn&#39;t getting the full truth from the sorceress.

&quot;What&#39;s with the questions?&quot;  Raven&#39;s head tilted toward the girl, 
irritation set upon her features.  In fear of ruining their once 
friendly outing, Terra shrugged her shoulders, shifting her eyes back 
toward the sky.

&quot;I think Beast Boy likes me,&quot; Terra confessed.  &quot;I mean ... really likes 
me.&quot;

&quot;Is it that obvious?&quot;  Raven&#39;s sarcasm seemed to return, though Terra 
still heard the tone in which she had held slight offense to earlier.  
&quot;I hadn&#39;t noticed.&quot;

&quot;Everything alright with you, Raven?&quot;  Terra now turned to her side to 
view the girl fully, resting her head upon a propped arm, while her 
other hand was placed onto her side.  Raven regretted turning to her, 
her eyes focusing upon the full sapphire hues, almost in a trance-like 
state that forced her to shake her head fully in order to awaken her 
back to her senses.

&quot;Peachy,&quot; another answer that seemed to sprout without her own consent.  
Abnormal reply from the sorceress resulted in a furrowed brow of the 
elementalist, who simply stared down the girl before her.  Raven reached 
back and pulled up the hood to her cloak, which shadowed over her eyes.  
She heard the girl sigh and suddenly felt a tug at the rim of her cloak.  
Blinking, she viewed the blonde&#39;s bright hues hovering upside-down over 
her while she pulled the hood to her cloak back fully.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t hide your face,&quot; Terra admitted while smiling.  &quot;Your 
eyes are very beautiful.&quot;

&quot;As are yours,&quot; Raven&#39;s own words seemed to come from nowhere.  It was 
as if someone else had said them, and placed them into a synthesizer to 
make it sound like it had been her own.  Her eyes widened in shock, 
while Terra&#39;s own fa&#135;ade seemed to warm.  Raven instantly sat up, 
pulling away from the grasp of the elementalist, pulling her hood back 
on quickly to overshadow her eyes, noticing her heart rate instantly 
racing.  Why the hell did she say that?

&quot;I knew there was something about you,&quot; she heard the voice behind her 
call out to her back.  Terra smiled lightly while her head tilted to the 
side.  She had noticed for far too long the new distaste she held for 
Beast Boy and Robin whenever they attempted to flirt with herself and 
Starfire.  Jealousy was one thing Terra had never thought of, but now 
... her smile began to fill her face.  

&quot;There&#39;s nothing about me,&quot; Raven was quick in her attempt to vacate the 
accusations Terra had come to assume, though even she herself started to 
doubt her own words.

&quot;Oh, there&#39;s something alright,&quot; she heard as she felt a hand upon her 
shoulder slowly forcing her to turn, staring intently into the slightly 
taller blonde&#39;s eyes.  &quot;And I wanna find out what.&quot;



xXxXxXxXx



&quot;I&#39;m out...&quot; Terra&#39;s voice sounded over the small speaker a few days 
later, which was implanted into the mask of the mercenary.  Slade stood 
calmly in front of the screen that flashed before her, while she 
attempted to appear cool, calm, and collected.  Slade&#39;s eyes lowered, a 
frown evident behind the orange and black mask.  &quot;I ... I don&#39;t want to 
be apart of your plans anymore.&quot;

&quot;Is that so,&quot; the man&#39;s voice was overly calm, which sent shivers down 
the girl&#39;s spine.  Ever since her training with the martial artist to 
control her powers, his attitude toward life simply scared her.  True, 
he was a man of his word, but ruthless nonetheless.  

&quot;I don&#39;t think I can go through with this,&quot; Terra attempted toward 
persuasion, feeling that she truly couldn&#39;t turn on her friends.  &quot;I 
don&#39;t want to hurt them.&quot;

&quot;Listen to me, Terra,&quot; Slade&#39;s calm voice came back over the speaker in 
her ear, which was hidden by her long blonde mane.  &quot;I&#39;m not going to 
force you to do anything you don&#39;t want to do.&quot;

&quot;You ... you wont?&quot;  Terra couldn&#39;t believe what she had just heard.  

&quot;Of course not, my child,&quot; Slade stated, while keeping his eyes focused 
upon the picture before him.  &quot;However, I do expect something in return.  
I did train you, after all.&quot;

&quot;Something in return?&quot;  Terra&#39;s stomach turned.  He did help her ... he 
had helped her out quite a bit.  She had become so much stronger since 
she had last seen the Titans, and it was only fair to return the favor.

&quot;I want you to turn off the security system in Titans Tower tonight,&quot; 
Slade said, his voice more demanding than asking.  Terra hesitated to 
answer, her brows lowering in worry.  &quot;If you don&#39;t, I&#39;m not certain I 
can keep the secret of your true identity any longer.&quot;

&quot;What?  No, you can&#39;t!&quot;  Terra shouted, but quickly attempted to keep 
her voice down, hearing the sounds of footsteps just down the hallway 
from her room.

&quot;Terra, everything okay in there?&quot;  It was Beast Boy.  Damn, he always 
had bad timing.  

&quot;Yea, everything&#39;s fine, I just uh ... bumped my leg on um ... 
something,&quot; she quickly shouted to the closed door.  Silence lasted for 
a moment before the teen&#39;s voice called back.

&quot;Alright, well ... the rest of us are gonna watch a movie, you wanna 
join us?&quot;  She hadn&#39;t though her voice was that convincing, but 
apparently the changeling liked her enough not to notice ... or he was 
simply dumbfounded.

&quot;Not right now, I&#39;m right in the middle of something,&quot; she quickly 
shouted back, noting the mercenary rolling his eyes on the other side of 
the viewing screen of the hand held communicator.

&quot;Okay, maybe later?&quot;  Damn it, Beast Boy, do you have to do this right 
now?

&quot;Sure, later sounds good,&quot;  Terra quickly replied.  Footsteps walking 
passed her door and out of sounds reach relieved her, and she quickly 
turned back to the small monitor in the center of her palm.  &quot;Please, 
you can&#39;t tell anyone!&quot;

&quot;Calm down, my child,&quot; Slade&#39;s voice was calm and cool, similar to what 
Terra had attempted to sound like when she initiated the call.  &quot;I&#39;m 
hoping it doesn&#39;t come to that.  All I&#39;m asking of you is to turn off 
the security system after the Titans go to bed.&quot;

&quot;What ... what are you planning to do?&quot;  Terra&#39;s voice was shaky, 
completely shattering her earlier attempts of keeping herself brave.  
She feared for her friends&#39; safety.  

&quot;I&#39;m only going to hack into their system to delete any information they 
have on me.  I don&#39;t plan on staying in this city too much longer,&quot; 
Slade admitted to the screen before him, his hands clasped behind his 
back as they always were.

&quot;You&#39;re ... you&#39;re leaving?&quot;  Once again, Terra&#39;s ears tried to deceive 
her.  She watched as the man nodded on the other side.

&quot;I have grown tired of fighting with the Titans,&quot; Slade continued on.  
&quot;I fear this will simply become an endless battle, one of which I feel I 
am to old to continue with.  I guess you could say I&#39;ve grown quite 
tired of Jump City.&quot;

Terra couldn&#39;t believe it.  Slade ... leave Jump City?  For good?  She 
was at a loss for words, while viewing the cold eyes of the mercenary, 
which hadn&#39;t changed in expression since she had made the call.  Maybe 
she truly could get the second chance she desired so much.

&quot;Wow, thank you, Slade ...&quot;

&quot;Oh, and Terra,&quot; Slade&#39;s voice came up just before she closed the lid, 
relaying something that would later scare the blonde half to death.  
&quot;Keep in touch...&quot;



xXxXxXxXx



Raven&#39;s eyes flashed open immediately, waking quickly from her silent 
slumber.  The girl&#39;s lavender strands parted to the side while she 
quickly shot upward, determined to find out just what it was that awoke 
her.  She quickly scanned her room while holding the gray tone sheet to 
her chest, brows furrowed in slight annoyance.  Her eyes were well 
adjusted to the shadows of the room, but she noticed nothing out of 
place, or anything that would have woken her from her dreams.  Tap!  A 
sound at her window.  Lilac eyes quickly shifted to her left toward the 
window, removing the sheeted blanket from her torso, revealing the black 
skin-layered leotard she chose to sleep in.  To the window she walked, 
wondering what exactly it was that could have hit her window.  She 
opened it to view the blonde haired elementalist sitting cross-legged on 
a rock, with a serious look upon her features.  It soon diminished when 
she noticed the girl had finally awoke, replacing it with the half 
smirk-like smile she was well known for.

&quot;You sleep in that too?&quot;  Terra joked, while lifting the rock up to the 
sorceress&#39; window.  Raven regarded the girl with a light frown, to which 
simply added in the girl&#39;s smirk.

&quot;What are you doing out here this late?&quot;  Raven asked, rubbing her eyes 
slightly, then crossed her arms over her chest and straightening her 
back.

&quot;I wanted to see if Raven could come out to play,&quot; Terra teased.  Raven 
arched a brow, never really understanding the girl&#39;s antics.

&quot;It&#39;s late,&quot; Raven replied as her hands moved toward the window in an 
attempt to close it.  Terra&#39;s face pouted lightly, but returned to the 
smirk, quickly relaying a message before the window closed.

&quot;I can keep throwing rocks at your window all night, you know,&quot; the 
sorceress heard, just as she shut the window.  She frowned at the girl, 
quickly closing the curtains; another tap sounding at her window, just 
as she had shut it.  The sorceress shook her head at the girl&#39;s 
immaturity, letting out a sigh while she dragged her body back toward 
her bed.  Another tap, followed by several others before she could even 
make it to her mattress.  Another sigh followed before Raven altered her 
course, and walked toward her closet to retract her cloak.
