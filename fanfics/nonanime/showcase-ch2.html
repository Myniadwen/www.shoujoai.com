<h1>DC Universe 2045: Showcase (part 2 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/showcase-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>        Helena Wayne looked out into the dark Gotham night, letting her 
thoughts roam where they would. The cowl of her black costume was pulled 
back, her short black hair pushed back by a single swipe of her hand. 
Over her breasts the stylized purple bird logo stretched out it&#146;s wings, 
the name and symbol she had chosen in honor of her foster mothers.

        The door behind her opened, and Barbara Gordon-Lance made her 
way out to the porch to stand by Helena&#146;s side. The metal braces on her 
legs, a gift of Wayne enterprises, made it possible for her to walk, but 
it wasn&#146;t always easy on her.

        &#147;You&#146;re thinking about that girl, aren&#146;t you?&#148; Barbara teased 
gently.

        Helena blushed tellingly. Yes, she had been thinking of B-ko, 
but she wasn&#146;t going to admit it. &#147;Of course not,&#148; she answered with as 
much dignity as she could possibly muster.

        &#147;You lie terribly,&#148; Dinah Lance walked over to stand by her 
wife. The blonde put a supporting arm across the redhead&#146;s shoulders.

        Under both her adopted mothers&#146; gaze Helena wilted slightly. 
&#147;All right,&#148; she softly admitted, &#147;I was thinking about her.&#148; She looked 
out at the city again, &#147;I guess I&#146;m a bit disappointed she didn&#146;t invite 
me along to meet her mother.&#148;

        &#147;You want to meet her mother?&#148; Barbara said with a smile. She 
looked mildly offended, &#147;But you haven&#146;t even introduced her to us yet!&#148;

        &#147;Mom,&#148; Helena protested.

        &#147;Don&#146;t tease her,&#148; Dinah chuckled. She looked at Helena 
thoughtfully for a moment, &#147;Who knows, this one might actually be 
serious.&#148;

        &#147;Gee, thanks,&#148; Helena smiled slightly. She reached back and drew 
her cowl forward, letting it settle about her face as her entire 
attitude changed. Helena Wayne was gone, Kestrel was here. &#147;I&#146;m going 
out on patrol,&#148; she said quietly, &#147;be back in a couple of hours.&#148;

        &#147;Be careful,&#148; Barbara managed to get out before the dark figure 
completely disappeared into the night. She stood there a moment, Dinah 
at her side, before looking up at her and quietly saying, &#147;I don&#146;t know 
if I&#146;ll ever get used to Helena calling me Mom.&#148;

        &#147;You&#146;re the closest thing to a mother she&#146;s had,&#148; Dinah pointed 
out quietly. She looked down at Barbara and asked, &#147;Does it bother you?&#148;

        &#147;No,&#148; Barbara shook her head with a smile, &#147;I&#146;m glad.&#148;

        Kestrel moved like the bird that was her namesake, using her 
lines and hooks to gracefully soar from building to building. It was 
never that quiet in Gotham, and every now and then she would descend to 
the street level.

        Muggers, gunmen, purse-snatchers, they were all dealt with using 
the same fluid grace and deep strength. They had taught her well, 
Barbara and Dinah, creating a fighter of incredible skills. Couple that 
with her sparring with both the original Nightwing and Cassandra Cain, 
and you had a fighter almost without peer.

        &#147;Haii!&#148; the attacker came at Kestrel, kicking up swiftly only to 
be stopped by a forearm block. The girl in red, green and black swiftly 
recovered, striking blow upon blow against Kestrel&#146;s guard, but not one 
of them got through to the kid&#146;s obvious dismay.

        &#147;What do you think?&#148; the quiet voice came from behind Kestrel.

        &#147;She telegraphs her moves,&#148; Kestrel answered as she continued to 
block, &#147;she hasn&#146;t got enough upper body strength just yet and,&#148; she 
noted the girl&#146;s panting, &#147;her endurance needs work.&#148; Ducking down 
smoothly she executed a simple sweep kick, dropping the girl to the 
ground of the alley. She threw a punch to her face, stopping it just 
above the stunned girl&#146;s nose. &#147;On the other hand,&#148; Kestrel smiled, &#147;she 
does have potential.&#148;

        Kestrel rose, and taking the girl&#146;s hand pulled her up to her 
feet. The little redhead was quite athletic, and she filled out the 
Robin outfit nicely. Oddly, instead of a mask she wore a pair of 
oversized sunglasses.

        The black clad figure walked up the dark alley towards them, 
smiling slightly despite the fact that her mask covered her entire face. 
She wasn&#146;t that much taller than Kestrel, but there was a strong 
presence about her. Her uniform looked much like Kestrel&#146;s did, but 
instead of a purple bird emblem hers was golden.

        &#147;Raven,&#148; Kestrel smiled and shook her former partner&#146;s hand. She 
grinned, &#147;So this is the new Robin you were telling me about?&#148;

        Raven gave a dignified nod.

        Kestrel looked over at Robin and gave the embarrassed girl a 
gentle smile, &#147;Lets go up to the roofs, we can talk more easily up 
there.&#148;

        They used their lies to quickly ascend the building, and once 
there Raven slid her cowl back, revealing the face of Cassandra Cain, 
while Kestrel unmasked as well. Robin pulled her sunglasses off and 
nervously said, &#147;Hi, I&#146;m Carrie Kelly.&#148;

        &#147;Helena Wayne,&#148; she shook the girl&#146;s hand with a smile.

        &#147;You&#146;re just... I mean... wow!&#148; Carrie finally blurted.

        Helena had to fight the urge to laugh at the awed look on 
Carrie&#146;s face. &#147;So how long have you been doing this?&#148; she asked her.

        &#147;A few weeks,&#148; Carrie said with a blush.

        There was a disturbance a few streets over and Carrie gave a 
expectant look at her partner. Raven smiled, &#147;Go on. We&#146;ll back you up 
if needed.&#148;

        A grinning Carrie was off like a shot, slipping her sunglasses 
on as she went, while Helena and Cassandra followed silently behind to 
keep an eye on her. &#147;How did you meet her?&#148; Helena asked Cassandra 
curiously.

        In the alley below them, Robin startled the criminals with a 
loud cry before dropping right into the middle of them. Kestrel noted 
that her fighting style was pretty chaotic, but she was holding her own 
against the thugs quite efficietly.

        &#147;Carrie made up her own Robin costume, and was going out at 
night fighting criminals with no training at all,&#148; Cassandra smiled 
slightly, &#147;so I tracked her down to try to convince her to stop.&#148; She 
shook her head ruefully, &#147;Instead, I found myself agreeing to train 
her.&#148;

        &#147;Both you and Tim, I guess?&#148; Helena asked, and Cassandra nodded. 
She smiled slightly, &#147;Where is Nightwing tonight, ayway?&#148;

        &#147;Talking with Bruce. It seems Mr. Wayne has built a suit of 
Bat-armor to &#145;help out&#146; occasionally,&#148; Cassandra smiled.

        &#147;Knowing him the way that we do, he&#146;d be out every night,&#148; 
Helena agreed. She hesitated a moment, &#147;Do you think it bothers him that 
none of us chose to take on the Bat name?&#148;

        &#147;No, I don&#146;t think so,&#148; Cassadra replied. She smiled grimly, 
&#147;He&#146;s always understood that the Bat was his mantle alone, especially 
after the disasterous attempt Azrael made to try and replace him. Bruce 
Wayne is the Batman, none other.&#148;

        Down in the alley the criminals were down, and Robin was 
standing atop one waving her fist in the air. &#147;Winner and new champion!&#148; 
she crowed.

        Helena looked over at Cassandra, &#147;I can&#146;t wait to see you 
teaching her the stealth skills.&#148;

        Cassandra looked down at her with a sigh.</pre>
