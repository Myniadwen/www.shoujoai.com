<h1>I Shall Never Forgive!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/doubleru.html">Double Ru</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sylvannas Windrunner stood on a hill and stared west waiting for the 
messenger the High Mage Antonidas spoke about. It wasn&#39;t as if she 
wanted to but diplomatic relationships were highest priority even during 
the war. And no one cared about the fact that this madman Arthas&#39; 
attacks became more frequent each day, Elven reinforcements delayed and 
the closer the Death Knight came to Quel&#39;Thalas, the colder and thinner 
the air around it became... Sylvannas shrugged off the annoying thoughts 
and peered west again, just like a hundred times before.

And just as if the Holy Light heard her thoughts, something stirred in 
the wilderness of the forest. She didn&#39;t see anything, but her ears 
quickly caught up a sound she has almost started considering natural in 
the last weeks - the sound of battle. With a frustrated sigh, Sylvannas 
pulled her bow from the back and recalled the map of the area. It looked 
like the messenger was going to need some assistance...

But suddenly, the sounds stopped. For the first time, Sylvannas though 
of the messenger with something other than annoyance - to take out an 
entire undead patrol, that was admirable. And she was sure of this now, 
since the ghouls had a lovely habit of devouring the dead bodies of the 
slain enemies, loudly crushing bones and muscular tissues with their 
rotten teeth... But right now, there was silence.

She picked up light footsteps of the messenger when he was a few hundred 
steps away. A dozen steps closer, she recognized that he was ought to be 
an Elf. Or a human woman. A woman single-handedly eliminating a ghoul 
squad? Not like Sylvannas couldn&#39;t pull it off herself, but to think 
that someone else could be just as good and that this someone is another 
woman was disturbing, to say the least. And in a few minutes, the 
messenger appeared out of the trees encircling the hill and the last 
doubt was gone.

The woman was tall (although not tall enough to give men around an 
inferiority complex, Sylvannas though with a little jealousy) and 
slender, moving with that special kind of grace that only the 
professional dancers and warriors possess. She wore plain men&#39;s clothes, 
which were miraculously white considering the trouble with the ghouls 
she got into just a couple of minutes ago, and an amethyst cloak covered 
with arcane symbols with a hood obscuring her face. But even before the 
woman down the hill lowered it, Sylvannas knew who was in front of her.

&quot;Miss Jaina Proudmoore, I presume?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Jaina&#39;s voice was deep and soft, as if she was performing in the 
Royal Opera for years. But a mage&#39;s voice is ought to be like this, 
considering all the spells and incantations they have to learn, guessed 
Sylvannas, fighting back an unexpected surge of jealousy. Jaina lowered 
the hood and revealed a pretty face and a strange testing gaze of her 
blue eyes with something unidentifiable flickering deep behind them... 
&quot;A pleasure to meet you, Lady Sylvannas Windrunner.&quot;

&quot;The pleasure is all mine,&quot; Sylvannas replied, wondering how Jaina knew 
her name. Either Antonidas told her who composed the welcome committee 
or...

&quot;No-no, my powers of far-seeing are moderate, at best,&quot; Jaina noticed 
the puzzled expression on her face and smiled. &quot;I just figured out that 
only one woman in Quel&#39;Thalas can walk the forests nowadays alone and 
armed with a mere bow...&quot;

&quot;I see. But I guess, now there are two of us... I mean the undead that 
attacked you down in the clearing.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that...&quot; Jaina&#39;s expression suddenly hardened, but Sylvannas 
noticed that behind the disgust in her eyes, there was something else, 
some secret, tormenting pain... &quot;Those pathetic creatures weren&#39;t a lot 
to care about. I wonder why Arthas put such here in the first place.&quot;

&quot;This path is considered safe,&quot; Sylvannas pointed out coldly. &quot;Was 
considered safe, at least, until you showed up.&quot;

&quot;I apologize, Lady Sylvannas, I didn&#39;t intend on putting your 
intelligence work in question.&quot;

&quot;Apology accepted. Wouldn&#39;t it be nicer for us to continue our dialogue 
elsewhere?&quot;

&quot;As you wish, General. As of now, I&#39;m temporarily under your command.&quot;

As the two of them walked back to the Elven base, hidden so deep in the 
woods that even Arthas&#39; spies apparently knew nothing of it, Sylvannas 
couldn&#39;t stop thinking what Jaina&#39;s last words meant. Has Antonidas 
assigned her to Sylvannas base as a kind of reinforcement? Then why has 
he called her &quot;a messenger&quot;? What was her message? Somehow, Sylvannas 
hesitated to ask the sorceress about it. And Jaina walked in silence, 
too.

After they arrived at the base, Sylvannas entrusted her guest (she 
decided thus after a long consideration) to the servants and moved 
straight to the command post.

&quot;Report,&quot; she ordered quietly to the lieutenant on duty. There was no 
need to shout here.

&quot;No news, General. The undead are stills searching the woods for the 
last Runestone, but we have it secured for the time. Prince Arthas 
hasn&#39;t left the base since the last attack so we don&#39;t know what he&#39;s up 
to. The far-seers reported some activity on the west path half an hour 
ago, but they cannot say anything for sure. I sent a squad for clean up, 
just in case. Do you want them to pull back?&quot;

&quot;No, lieutenant, let them do their job and keep the observation up,&quot; 
Sylvannas leaned back on a chair and closed her eyes. Somehow, she felt 
tired. It was the fourth base she had to set up after that Arthas came 
ravaging the woods... And probably, the last, as well. Next stop would 
be Silvermoon. She wondered how many fights Jaina has been through, how 
many homes she had to abandon. But again, she hesitated to go and ask...

In the meanwhile, Jaina was exploring the camp. It was a standard Elven 
ranger base, quickly erected and quick abandoned; easy come, easy go. 
She even felt sorry for the Elves, having to abandon what they have just 
built and build up again only to abandon it in a few days. It was a 
vicious circle Arthas put them in, Jaina thought and clenched her teeth. 
&quot;Do not think of Arthas, Jaina. Don&#39;t. Arthas is dead. Killed along with 
poor Muradin on the icy Northernd...&quot; That helped but she knew it was 
only for a while.


&quot;Do you need something, M&#39;lady?&quot; her guide asked, breaking the silence.

&quot;Yes, please...&quot; Jaina wondered what she was supposed to ask. Then she 
noticed the sun already setting down behind the trees. &quot;I will have to 
stay here for the night. Is there a place for me to sleep?&quot;

&quot;I think so, M&#39;lady, but I will have to check first.&quot;

&quot;Of course, do it right away, please.&quot;

The servant strode off and then Jaina was alone again. As she wondered 
the camp aimlessly, she couldn&#39;t help it but to admire the courage and 
resilience of Sylvannas and her Elves. Despite constantly being driven 
back, her small hunter squads were dealing the monstrous undead army 
more damage than all forces of Lordaeron combined. And even more 
astoundingly, Sylvannas managed to evade death in dozens of deadly traps 
the undead set for her. Jaina tried to imagine herself leading an army 
or even a small band of rangers into battle, and shivered at the thought 
of it. No, she wasn&#39;t a General. She was neither a good warrior, nor a 
good leader. Andorhal and Stratholme made it pretty clear. She shivered 
again, fighting back unwanted tears.

&quot;M&#39;lady?&quot; The guide waited silently for a minute for her to notice him 
before interrupting Jaina&#39;s thoughts.

&quot;Yes, sorry... What have you found out?&quot;

&quot;I am really sorry, M&#39;lady, but there is no place to rest in the camp... 
Due to space deficit, we&#39;ve been having all kinds of 
uncomfortabilities... The smaller the camp, the easier it is to keep it 
hidden... But if M&#39;lady wishes, I could arrange some soldiers or 
servants to sleep outside...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Jaina gave the servant a reassuring smile. &quot;I&#39;m used to 
sleeping in the woods now. And you people should have all your strength 
in case Arthas attacks.&quot;

&quot;But it is absolutely unacceptable, M&#39;lady!&quot; protested the servant. &quot;It 
is too dangerous! There is another possibility, however...&quot;

&quot;Such as?&quot; Jaina raised her brow.

&quot;The General&#39;s marquee has enough place for two people, however, it is 
Lady Sylvannas&#39; right to share it with no one...&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;ll have to go and ask, then. Thank you.&quot;

&quot;You are welcome, Lady Jaina.&quot;

Jaina dismissed the servant and approached the command post. Somehow, 
she felt more than timid about disturbing her host during an important 
strategy discussion or tactical planning with an unashamed request to 
share Sylvannas&#39; private tent with her... The closer she came to the 
post, the slower her pace became and it took almost an effort to enter 
it. Jaina looked around the room, noticing a lieutenant on duty and two 
other rangers peering at the map of the region. She searched for 
Sylvannas and found her in the far corner with her eyes closed and 
muscles relaxed.

&quot;Great. Now I have to wake her up, on top of things&quot;. Her natural 
shyness, this curse of hers she was born with, made her stand there 
stupidly looking at the green-clad figure of Sylvannas and not daring to 
move in her direction. She didn&#39;t have a slightest doubt, that even if 
the camp were to be invaded by the undead, Sylvannas would be the first 
to react. And probably the first to bring down a couple of ghouls before 
others, including Jaina, manage to grab the weapons.

&quot;How long are you going to stare at me, miss Proudmoore?&quot; suddenly asked 
Sylvannas, eyes still closed, and Jaina blushed as the officers turned 
to her, noticing she was there for the first time. &quot;Did you need 
something?&quot;

&quot;No... I mean, yes, I do... In fact...&quot;

&quot;You - dismissed, I&#39;ll keep the watch,&quot; Sylvannas commanded to the 
officers who obeyed immediately. Her green eyes were now mustering 
Jaina. &quot;So, what was it?&quot;

&quot;You see, I have to stay here overnight, but there is no place here and 
the servants won&#39;t allow me to sleep outside, although I don&#39;t want to 
cause any trouble to your corps...&quot;

&quot;So you would like to ask me to share my tent with you,&quot; this wasn&#39;t 
even a question.

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;Be my guest, then.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Jaina stared at Sylvannas in disbelief who gave her a faint 
smile.

&quot;Really. Like I care... I&#39;m stuck here until midnight now, anyway...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

&quot;Just beat it, will you... You don&#39;t mind me calling you Jaina, would 
you?&quot;

&quot;No, of course, not.&quot;

&quot;Nice. It&#39;s Sylvannas and Jaina, then.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; It was the only thing to say that Jaina could think about. 
The familiarity of Sylvannas was unexpected, but somehow, she really 
didn&#39;t mind. This Sylvannas was much more likable than the icy lady she 
met out in the forest... &quot;Thank you very much.&quot;

Sylvannas grimaced and turned around to peer at the maps. She heard 
Jaina leave, just as she heard her come, and then she leaned back on her 
chair again. She wondered, why was it that this woman - no, this girl - 
has so quickly softened her heart. Was it something in her behavior? In 
her appearance? The idea of Jaina being a spy assigned to her was absurd 
for Arthas was never known to ascend to such methods of warfare and what 
could possibly lure the most powerful sorceress ever born to the side of 
the undead? These questions seemed endless, but in the end, she 
concluded that in the first place, it was Jaina&#39;s voice that charmed 
her.

Ever since her childhood, Sylvannas dreamed of singing. To perform for 
the Royal Operas of Quel&#39;Thalas, Dalaran, Lordaeron... To travel from 
the northern Lordaeron to the southern Azeroth... To receive love 
letters and poems written by romantic boys of all ages in a hope to draw 
her attention... Childhood&#39;s dreams, as she realized now, typical for 
any adolescent girl, be she of human or Elven origin. Now she saw that 
her place was here, using her talents to protect what she loved - her 
homeland, her city and her people. Just like Alleria did. Sylvannas 
forced herself not to think about it, fighting the tears back. But one 
passion remained, she thought. The passion to have a voice good enough 
to earn the applause of all peoples of Azeroth. Just like Jaina&#39;s one. 
This was her little private secret that no one ever knew about.

When Sylvannas returned to her tent past midnight, Jaina was already 
sleeping. She looked at her peaceful face and started undressing. Jaina 
may look cute and helpless now, but even her limited magic abilities 
were enough to sense the titanic aura of power around her. This power 
was wild and untamed now, Sylvannas wasn&#39;t even sure that the sorceress 
was even aware of it, but once she learns to use it... She doubted that 
even the demons of the ancient legends would stand a chance then!

Jaina muttered something in the sleep, turning to the wall. Sylvannas 
slipped under her blanket, thinking about the servants who have probably 
managed to discover her decision to allow Jaina to sleep in her tent and 
to organize a sleeping place for her in the short time while the 
sorceress walked here from the command post. Or have they known what her 
decision is going to be from the beginning? One never knows...

She turned away from Jaina, facing the other wall of the tent, and 
thought that magic was yet another thing that the human girl bested her 
in. Jaina was the most capable sorceress alive and she, Sylvannas of the 
ancient clan of Windrunners, wasn&#39;t even capable of summoning an Air 
Elemental! One good thing was that Jaina never summoned the Power of the 
Air. She heard that her strength lied with the element of Water - 
probably, because her father was an admiral. Magic is a family thing, 
after all...

&quot;Sylvannas, are you sleeping?&quot; Jaina&#39;s voice was an almost inaudible 
whisper.

&quot;Not yet. What is it, Jaina?&quot;

&quot;For how long have you fought these wars?..&quot;

&quot;What is it, a bedtime talk? Long enough, first the Orcs, now the 
Undead...&quot;

&quot;But still...&quot;

&quot;Ever since I was born,&quot; Sylvannas smiled grimly. &quot;And believe me, you 
don&#39;t want to know how long ago that was...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry... I was just wondering, why do you do that...&quot;

&quot;Do what? Fighting? Because I have nothing else I can do. None of my 
family can.&quot;

&quot;My father was a Grand Admiral of Lordaeron, but that doesn&#39;t mean 
that...&quot;

&quot;And yet you, a sorceress of Dalaran and the best student of Antonidas, 
have been there in Brill, Andorhal and Stratholme, fighting, killing...&quot;

That was a step too far. Sylvannas cursed under her breath as she heard 
a silent sob from the other side of the tent. Then another one. And 
before she knew it, Jaina was weeping like a child. Sylvannas has never 
learned how to act in such situation for she has never been in one. So 
she turned towards Jaina and said the first thing what came across her 
mind in that second:

&quot;Tell me about him. Tell me about Arthas.&quot;

And for some reason, that was the right thing to say. Jaina was too 
astounded to keep crying and for the time, it was all that mattered.

&quot;You want me to tell you about... But don&#39;t you hate him?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Though he hates me for sure,&quot; Sylvannas gave her another 
grim smile, as Jaina turned her face to her. &quot;The intelligence reports 
him swearing by the name of the Lich King to kill me personally and 
exact some kind of terrible revenge... That was just after the breach of 
the first Gate. Huh, like I care... But you definitely need to share 
your memories with someone, Jaina. You can&#39;t carry that burden all in 
yourself, trust me.&quot;

Sylvannas was surprised herself hearing herself saying such things, even 
more so Jaina. What, in the name of Twisting Nether, was wrong with her? 
Where has she picked up this motherly tone, these soothing intonations? 
She could but wonder. But Jaina was staring at her with such admiration, 
her blue eyes shining so brightly... And then she started telling.

It was a strange but Sylvannas didn&#39;t mind hearing the story. It was 
even funny to compare what she saw of the black-clad cold-hearted Death 
Knight with the accursed sword of his and the person Jaina knew from her 
childhood. What force could have made such thing to a living being? He 
was gentle, Jaina told her, skipping words and rushing sentences, he was 
kind to everyone, even to Kael, another childhood friend, who competed 
for her heart, as well. These two spent entire nights writing poems and 
serenades to express their admiration for her... And the other nights 
when they performed those serenades under her windows, taking turns 
until the Palace Guard chased them off.

In the end, she chose Arthas because he was... Jaina stopped for a 
moment. He was gentler, she simply said at last. Kael was often smarter 
and stronger, but Arthas had something in him that made him different, 
different from other people. But in the end, it didn&#39;t really matter 
whom she chose, after all. When an invitation from Dalaran came, she 
didn&#39;t hesitate long. That&#39;s when Arthas joined the Paladins. Jaina 
often wondered, whether he hadn&#39;t end up this way if she had stayed with 
him back then? If they got married and had kids? Would that have 
prevented that terrible night at Stratholme?..

Jaina was still sobbing uncontrollably, as she finished her tale. 
Sylvannas lay silently, looking into Jaina&#39;s eyes. She somehow failed to 
notice when the two of them drew nearer to each other, their faces now 
being only a few inches apart. But that didn&#39;t matter.

- Listen, Jaina, and listen carefully. Your Arthas, the boy you 
remember, is dead. Now there is nothing to be done about it. The man out 
there is not your Arthas - he is a namesake, nothing more. And one more 
thing - everyone chooses his own mistakes. I don&#39;t know about fate or 
whatever, but the mistakes we make are ours by right. And no one may 
blame oneself for the mistakes Arthas made. Not even you.

- Thank you, Sylvannas, thank you so much... I&#39;m sorry you had to hear 
all this...

- Don&#39;t worry, - Sylvannas smiled. For some reason, she was happy, for 
the first time in many days. - That&#39;s the duty of a good leader to keep 
the spirits up.

And as Jaina stared at her with those shining eyes of hers, a crazy 
thought crossed Sylvannas&#39; mind. She drew even closer to her and kissed 
her smiling lips.

It wasn&#39;t like anything she experienced before. Sylvannas had a plenty 
of lovers in her life, shy youths and experienced ladies&#39; men, but none 
of them answered her kiss with such passion, such tenderness. She 
suddenly thought that her entire war knowledge is worth nothing compared 
with this one kiss... And as Jaina didn&#39;t pull away, Sylvannas stretched 
her arms and embraced the sorceress. Later, she vaguely remembered the 
satisfaction she felt, as if all Jaina&#39;s talents she was so jealous of 
were rightfully hers as long as she held her...

For a moment, when Sylvannas kissed her, Jaina thought of Arthas, their 
first kiss, how young and inexperienced they were back then... But then 
it was long ago, she thought, and for the first time she remembered 
Arthas without guilt. The memories stopped torturing her after 
Sylvannas&#39; words. And so a moment later she answered the kissed with all 
the passion, all the gratitude she had and when the Elfine embraced her, 
Jaina answered her caresses.

Sylvannas woke up early in the morning, smiling to herself. Jaina still 
slept. She looked at her body, her soft skin, pale because of countless 
hours spent in the library... Jaina was a natural princess, and 
princesses shouldn&#39;t be allowed to risk their lives in war. But what 
should a princess do after her prince is gone? That&#39;s why she, 
Sylvannas, is going to be her prince now. She smiled again at the 
stupidity of her own thoughts. Something has definitely changed in her 
this night but right now she had to go check the posts. She got dressed 
quickly and left the tent.

&quot;Report,&quot; she ordered quietly to the officer on duty. She didn&#39;t feel 
like speaking loudly to anyone.

&quot;Disturbing news, General. The undead are on the move, however, we 
cannot figure out what they a planning to do. We&#39;ve picked first signs 
of activity in their camp an hour ago but they&#39;ve only made a move now. 
But the sight of it they are going to assault the Gate.&quot;

&quot;Pointless,&quot; cut him Sylvannas. &quot;The Gates won&#39;t open whatever monsters 
they bring with them. Where is Arthas?&quot;

&quot;Still no sight of him, General.&quot;

&quot;That proves it. It&#39;s a decoy attack and he&#39;ll certainly lead the main 
one. We wait.&quot;

&quot;Yes, General.&quot;

&quot;And order additional patrols on all the ways leading here and to the 
Runestone.&quot;

&quot;Yes, General.&quot;

&quot;And, of course, all the perimeters go on red alert.&quot;

&quot;Naturally, General.&quot;

The officer strode off, as others poured in the room longing for the 
orders. As she told them the details on their positions and formations, 
she couldn&#39;t stop thinking of Jaina still sleeping in her tent and not 
knowing about the danger. In the end, she dismissed the officers wishing 
them good luck and sprinted to the marquee. Jaina was already awake.

&quot;What&#39;s going on, Syl?&quot;

&quot;The undead are on the move. I&#39;m afraid that they&#39;ve rooted us out and 
are coming this way.&quot;

In a moment&#39;s notice, Jaina was on her feet dressed and ready for 
battle.

&quot;Requesting a permission to enter the battle on your side, General.&quot;

&quot;Negative.&quot;

Jaina stared at her in disbelief.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You stay here, Jaina, and if things get nasty, you get away and inform 
Silvermoon that the undead breached through. And that they should 
request reinforcements from Dalaran. That&#39;s an order.&quot;

&quot;But I can&#39;t,&quot; Jaina said breathlessly.

&quot;Look, Jaina,&quot; Sylvannas embraced her, pressing cheek to cheek, 
&quot;whatever happened between us, whatever you and I are feeling, there is 
absolutely no point for you to die out here. And don&#39;t worry about me, 
I&#39;ve managed so far.&quot;

&quot;But the message...&quot; Jaina looked very pale. &quot;The message I was supposed 
to deliver to Silvermoon from Dalaran... It said that Quel&#39;Thalas must 
hold at least another week for the Mages to pull all their powers 
together. If Silvermoon falls, the undead will have a clear road to 
Dalaran. Except for the Orc reservations, maybe...&quot;

Sylvannas sighed.

&quot;Well, I guess we&#39;ll have to hold this ground for a little bit longer.&quot;

&quot;But you said...&quot;

&quot;I only said, that we are operating at the last and the most powerful 
layer of defense. And that if something happens I want you to escape 
safely. I&#39;ll find you afterwards.&quot;

&quot;Do you promise?&quot;

&quot;I will, if you promise to follow my order.

&quot;I promise,&quot; said Jaina after a pause.

&quot;So do I,&quot; smiled Sylvannas. &quot;And now go, find yourself a nice spot.&quot;

She followed Jaina outside and then they split up.

&quot;General, intelligence reports that Prince Arthas has left the undead 
camp, but they have no idea when and in which direction. The camp looks 
deserted.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s bad. They are preparing for a head on assault. Have you got any 
reports from the Runestone?&quot;

&quot;Yes, the path is clear, no threat detected.&quot;

&quot;I know where the attack will commence. Prepare all you men to leave.&quot;

&quot;Yes, General!&quot;

As they left the camp, Sylvannas saw Jaina.

&quot;You&#39;ve promised!&quot;

&quot;I have,&quot; Sylvannas nodded. As she disappeared in the forest, she felt 
Jaina&#39;s warm gaze on her back.

Jaina wasn&#39;t good at far seeing. But this time something told her that 
it is going to work. The Runestone was half an hour of walk away. When 
Sylvannas appeared out of the forest, the troops greeted her like a 
goddess of victory. She was beautiful, moving like a hawk among the 
rangers, boosting their morale with jokes, reassurances and simply kind 
words. And then the onslaught came.

The problem was that it came perfectly simultaneous on the Runestone, 
the Gate and the ranger camp. Jaina thought to have caught a glimpse of 
Arthas before the waves of ghouls and other abominations stormed the 
defenses. There were simply too many of them. The Elves were putting a 
good deal of a fight but in a long run even a dozen of Jaina&#39;s 
Elementals wouldn&#39;t have stopped the enemies. Somehow, she still 
maintained contact with Sylvannas, at least, she heard her ordering to 
retread to the base. The next thing she remembered was Sylvannas, her 
face covered with blood from a wound on the forehead, emerging out of 
the forest with a handful of troops.

&quot;Everyone, fall back to the Gate!&quot; Sylvannas shouted. And then she saw 
Jaina: &quot;Jaina, I don&#39;t care what happens next, I want you out of here, 
now. Do you copy?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care. Get out!&quot;

&quot;But you promised to...&quot;

&quot;And I will. Now, go!&quot;

And before she could answer, Sylvannas strode forth, taking the 
remaining rangers to the Gate in the last desperate attempt to stop the 
undead. What should I do, Jaina thought, as she stood in the abandoned 
camp, risking facing an undead assault any moment. It was a dilemma and 
she had no time. And then she remembered the last night. She found out 
why Sylvannas always wore clothes that covered the whole body - she 
didn&#39;t want anyone to see the scars on her tanned skin. Then she asked 
Jaina whether she thought her ugly because of them. She said no. She 
said that what&#39;s inside matters the most. Sylvannas only smiled at this. 
Just like she smiled when she gave her the promise.

Jaina chanted the incantation and the next moment she was standing in 
the center of Silvermoon, with people turning their heads and running 
towards her.

&quot;You are from the Gate, right?&quot;

&quot;How does it look out there?&quot;

&quot;Is Sylvannas gonna beat them?&quot;

&quot;I have an important message for the authorities,&quot; Jaina tried to get 
through the crowd to the Town Hall.

&quot;I&#39;ve already told them all they need to know, Jaina,&quot; a deep, powerful 
voice reached her ears and in the silence that befell the square, the 
clacking sound of steel horseshoes that High Mage Antonidas always 
hacked his steed with was clearly audible. &quot;Come, Jaina, we don&#39;t have 
any time to spare.&quot;

Young sorceress was too amazed to resist his influence. Only after they 
left the square, she gathered herself and asked:

&quot;Are we going to help Sylvannas?&quot;

&quot;No, we cannot. Even the three of us wouldn&#39;t hold back the army that 
the Fallen Prince gathered.&quot;

&quot;But Sylvannas is alone out there...&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s why she has better chances to escape. These are her woods, 
Jaina. Even though this city is lost, we still have Dalaran. And there 
is another plan that only you can fulfill. That&#39;s why I can&#39;t let you go 
and die out there!&quot;

&quot;But Sylvannas...&quot;

And just as if the name has triggered something, the vision of such 
clarity and detail appeared before her eyes that she lost the touch with 
her own body. She was there, at the ruins of the Inner Gate of 
Silvermoon. Sylvannas was standing alone, all her rangers lying dead 
around her. Clutching a long dagger in her hand (her broken bow lied at 
a distance), the Elfine wiped the blood off her face as she watched the 
darkest figure approach from the undead army standing on the other side 
of the Gate.

&quot;Sylvannas Windrunner, at last, I met you again.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe in your courtesy, Arthas.&quot;

&quot;Ah, I see... You&#39;ve caused me a lot of trouble, General. And I&#39;m not 
forgetful. You see, I&#39;ve thought a lot about you and prepared something 
special considering your fate...&quot;

And before he finished talking, Arthas dashed forward, drawing 
Frostmourne and bearing on Sylvannas. Jaina thought she shouted a 
warning but Sylvannas hasn&#39;t heard her. The Elfine managed to parry two 
strikes but the third one was too much for the old blade she wielded - 
Frostmourne cut through the steel and bored deep into Sylvannas chest. 
For a moment, there was silence and then she fell down...

&quot;And now, about your reward...&quot;

But Jaina didn&#39;t hear him, screaming, struggling epileptically in the 
hands of Antonidas.

&quot;Easy, easy, Jaina... I didn&#39;t know you have such talent for 
clairvoyance...&quot;

&quot;He has killed her,&quot; Jaina said with empty voice, staring into the void. 
&quot;He has killed Syl...&quot;

&quot;Have you become friends?&quot; Antonidas asked gently. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

But Jaina didn&#39;t listen to him. She got back on her feet staring south, 
to the Gate and shouted:

&quot;Arthas! I&#39;ll never forgive you, Arthas! Do you hear me?! I shall never 
forgive!&quot;

And then she fell silent, recalling in terror how she heard similar 
words once before... It was Stratholme, six months ago. She barely did 
make it in time to hear Arthas shouting in desperate and helpless anger 
at Mal&#39;Ganis... Where would her words take her to?

&quot;Please, don&#39;t cry, girl, I&#39;m an old man, I don&#39;t know much about 
calming down young women,&quot; Antonidas helped her up again and even gave 
her his handkerchief to wipe off her tears. And as she looked up on him 
again, he continued: &quot;I have a very important assignment, just for you, 
no one else can do that. What have you heard of Kalimdor?..&quot;

Jaina answered and listened, but her mind was working in a slightly 
different direction. She thought of Sylvannas, how she was in life. She 
wanted to follow her path, to become a great leader like she was. And 
then, who knows, maybe it&#39;ll be just the right way to mourn her memory. 
At any pace, it was better than repeating Arthas&#39; mistakes and giving 
into the lust for revenge. &quot;Yes, Jaina, that is right,&quot; she almost heard 
Sylvannas&#39; voice. And then she smiled.</pre>
