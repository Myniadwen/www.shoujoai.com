<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/fairpuss-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Food is the highway to a man/woman/cat&#146;s heart

AN: Here is my personal version of &#145;Sleepy Hollow&#146;, the movie, and an 
allusion to &#145;Le Cid&#146; by Corneille (if you know what I&#146;m talking about, 
I&#146;ll give you a virtual cookie)...

&#147;OOOOOOH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OOOOOOOOHHHH - kof - kof - Ugh! Still have to 
train for the maniacal laughter!&#148;

The young women looked upon hearing the bone-chilling sound and found a 
leather armor-clad (understand small pieces of leather and chain-mail 
only covering strategic points in the pure tradition of heroic-fantasy 
heroines) woman with long green hair and bright orangish skin on the 
roof where the Puss in boots had probably been thrown from. She rested 
her hands on her hips, arrogantly looking down on them.

&#147;Listen to me pathetic creatures! Fear my wrath, I am Pumpkin, the 
official right hand woman of the real badass of this story! My mission 
is to kill you after making you feel endless pain, despair and abject 
terror...&#148; She licked her sensual lips. &#147;... And I&#146;ll take great 
pleasure in doing so.&#148; She finished huskily. She then reached in her 
generous cleavage and produced a purse, taking something from inside, 
she threw it at the group of gaping women.

Dread filled their innocent heart. Surely, something awful was going to 
happen! After such a grandiose introduction, it had to! Hell was 
probably about to vomit its monstrous armies! Herds of demons would 
ravage the world, burn, torture and... and confiscate all the booze for 
themselves, leaving no hope to mortals!

&#147;Err... guys?&#148; Ami said. &#147;It&#146;s just a little bean...&#148;

&#147;A bean?&#148; The three others echoed dumbly.

&#147;Yes, you know, any kind of leguminous plant with edible usually 
kindney- shaped seeds in long pods, which is obviously what she&#146;s just 
thrown...&#148;

Ami found herself on the receiving end of three blank stares during two 
good minutes before two of them finally lightened with understanding. 
Donkey Pelt was left trying understanding the dictionary definition.

&#147;Errmh... A bean, hum, yes... Are you sure?&#148; Michiru asked at last, 
having protectively placed herself between the threatening bean lying on 
the ground a few meters away and the cute feline. Makoto had done just 
the same since Ami was still tending the cat, although she didn&#146;t come 
too close to Michiru. The fish smell was steadily getting worse.

&#147;I am fairly positive.&#148;

&#147;No, I meant, don&#146;t you think it&#146;s a trap or something?&#148;

The young dwarf carefully pondered the question. &#147;Well, there is always 
a margin of error, but taking into account that nothing has happened for 
the past five minutes yet, that Miss Pumpkin looks as confused and 
clueless as Donkey Pelt and after solving a simple probability formula, 
I can say with a 82 % certainty, give or take 10 %, that this little 
bean is harmless, as long as none of the variables change of course.&#148;

Makoto just glomped the young dwarf. &#147;Isn&#146;t she cute when she&#146;s talking 
like that? I don&#146;t understand a bean, but it sounds so melodramatic! How 
could I not fall for her!&#148;

&#147;... Le...legumistuff ?&#148; Donkey Pelt asked, clearly stuck some lines 
ago.

Michiru blinked several times. &#147;So, you mean I could go and have a bath 
?&#148;

&#147;Arrrgh!&#148; Answered both Ami and the Puss in boots, the former turning as 
blue as her hair in the strong embrace of her girlfriend while the later 
started waking up.

Michiru kneeled back close to the mysterious Puss in boots, making 
Makoto hastily back away and Ami put a gaz mask on. &#147;Ooooh! God bless 
you Ami! She&#146;s waking up!&#148; She said, completely unaware of the others&#146;s 
reactions.

&#147;Hey you worthless heroines! Stop ignoring me! It&#146;s supposed to be the 
great fighting scene where I easily wipe your sorry arses out!&#148;

A dumbfounded silence answered her.

&#147;Hum... Sorry &#145;bout that... but I don&#146;t think any of us is into 
scato...&#148; Michiru finally managed to say, her (upper) cheeks and her 
friends&#146;s own burning (you didn&#146;t expect me to go and check on the 
lowers, did you? Not that I would mind, but I&#146;m not suicidal!).

Pumpkin&#146;s lower jaw hit the roof, making cracks under her feet. &#147;What 
the...? That wasn&#146;t what I was meaning, you perverts!&#148; and she rageously 
stomped her foot. As expected in these kinds of situations, the roof 
gave way and she fell through it with a startled yelp.

The others patiently waited for her to emerge out of the thick cloud of 
dough, dust and feathers. &#147;What a brilliant strategy, Lady Michiru!&#148; 
Donkey Pelt cooed, stars in her eyes.

The young ogress coughed in her fist. &#147;Hum... Brom... Yes, err, 
brilliant, wasn&#146;t it? I&#146;m glad everything worked out just as planned...&#148;

She was saved from the suspicious gazes of the two others, when their 
self- proclaimed enemy suddenly shot out of the house like she had just 
seen Lucifer himself. And indeed, &#147;COME BACK HERE YOU DAMN PUNK!!!&#148; an 
old hag shouted from the doorway. &#147;I put my best lingerie on just for 
you! Even the pink ribbon! You could at least have said something nice 
to me!&#148; With surprising strengh, she threw a large, black ball at 
Pumpkin before disappearing inside again, between fits of sobs.

The ball missed the green-haired woman&#146;s head, hit a wall, fell heavily 
on the ground with a thump and gently rolled to Donkey Pelt&#146;s feet who 
picked it up. The ball was made of some solid material and Donkey Pelt&#146;s 
arm quivered under it&#146;s weight. There were three holes, rather close to 
one another and big enough for someone to stick their fingers into. On 
the opposite face, a huge white circle with a black eight was painted. 
&#147;Oh wow!&#148; She chirped &#147;A magic ball!&#148;

Fleeing as quickly from the ogress as politeness allowed it, Makoto 
approached her, looking curiously at the ball. &#147;Isn&#146;t a magic ball 
supposed to be a billiard ball, not a bowling one? Or made of crystal?&#148;

Seeing that everyone was ignoring her again, Pumpkin pulled a nasty 
looking sword from behind her back and growling, charged Michiru. &#147;I&#146;m 
gonna cut your head off and take it as a trophee!&#148; She snarled. The 
young ogress was caught off guard by the attack since she had redirected 
all her attention back to the moaning (and damn cute) cat. The assassin 
smirked, just one swift slash and her mission would be partly achieved. 
When she was about two meters away from Michiru, time seemed to slow 
down as she was about to strike the surprised ogress. She licked her 
lips, thinking about the terror her victim was certainly feeling...

Then it hit her.

The stench wafted up her nostrils directly to her brain, it was so sharp 
that it threathened to fry the rosy organ to a crisp. It was like being 
hit by a professional boxer. Her eyes watered and foam appeared on the 
side of her mouth as she bonelessly collapsed at Michiru&#146;s feet.

&#147;What was that all about?&#148; The Puss weakly asked. When she had woken up, 
the beautiful young ogress was the first thing she saw. Well, it was the 
second, if you considered the dwarf who had almost caused her to have an 
heart attack with the awful giant fly head-looking mask that covered her 
face, but it didn&#146;t count... She didn&#146;t know why, but being so close to 
the ogress was even more compelling than the last time. It was as if 
each time she saw her, she was even more attracted. Yeah, there was just 
something about her that made her want to nuzzle her and...

Michiru tenderly stroked the cat&#146;s jaw line, causing her to purr 
automatically. &#147;Nothing relevent... I think this woman just spent way 
too much time in a suntan center. She&#146;s out for good.&#148; Her hand drifted 
behind the cat&#146;s ears and the purr got significantly louder. &#147;Are you 
alright? Can you stand up?&#148;

The Puss reluctantly nodded and got up. She couldn&#146;t remember having 
enjoyed being simply petted that much for ages. She was a wild cat after 
all, and wild cat had their pride! They certainly weren&#146;t humans&#146;s, or 
ogres&#146;s toys! A wild cat was its own master! A wild cat was always in 
control!

&#147;Woah! Lady Michiru, you were right! It really exist ! It&#146;s soooo cute!&#148; 
Donkey Pelt rushed to the giant cat, apparently completely unaffected by 
Michiru&#146;s smell. Holding the ball under one arm, she began to scratch 
her behind her ears as well and the cat began to senselessly purr again.

&#147;Err, yes...&#148; Michiru was startled to discover how it annoyed her that 
someone else petted the giant cat. It was just Donkey Pelt after all. 
Nothing to worry about! She turned back to the cat. &#147;Excuse me for being 
so rude. You saved my life and I never got to thank you properly. I 
didn&#146;t even introduce myself and my friends.&#148; She was satisfied when she 
got the cat&#146;s attention back and pointed at her companions successively. 
&#147;Here are Ami Mizuno, Donkey Pelt and Makoto Kino. And my name is 
Michiru Kaioh...&#148; She said as she gracefully curtsided.

Getting a grip on herself, the giant cat executed a very elaborate 
salute with her hat. &#147;I&#146;m honored to be in such delicious company.&#148; She 
then gently caught Michiru&#146;s right hand in her paw, intending to 
gentlemanly kiss it. &#147;My name&#146;s Tenoh... Tenoh Haruka...&#148; She took a 
whiff of Michiru&#146;s delicate scent and barely stopped herself lapping at 
the hand.

Michiru gasped and brutally freed her hand. &#147;You... You really are the 
famous Haruka Tenoh? The one who killed my sixth degree cousin and took 
his land over?&#148; She looked at the cat bitterly. &#147;And here I thought you 
were only a legend to scare little ogres...&#148; She took a few steps back, 
assuming a fighting stance while the others, save Makoto, gathered 
around her. She almost had tears in her eyes when she asked &#147;Did you 
really kill him?&#148;

&#145;Oh fuck! She said cousins!&#146; Haruka was thrown off balance by the sudden 
change of atmosphere. She wanted to deny everything, she wanted to erase 
the look of hurt and betrayal in those beautiful blue eyes. She wanted 
to be petted again... But she couldn&#146;t, she had made a promise a long 
time ago. Her honour, as well as other people&#146;s happiness, people dear 
to her heart, were in balance. She sighed regretfully. &#147;Yes, I killed 
him...&#148;

&#147;The... legend says you made him transform in a mouse and... and...&#148; she 
couldn&#146;t imagine it, it was too awful. &#147;... Are you here to... eat me 
too?&#148; Michiru&#146;s voice was quivering.

&#147;Yes... I am...&#148;

Life sucked!

---------------------------------------------------------------

The four women walked silently on the forest stony path. Once in a 
while, one of them would cast a worried glance at the young ogress 
leading them. It was as if all the light, all hapiness had been sucked 
out of her. She was just walking, staring blankly ahead. It had been 
like that ever since she tried to kill Haruka who easily escaped with an 
unnatural rapidity. As far as Ami and Makoto were concerned, the only 
improvement was that Michiru had taken a bath after that, at least.

Finally, Donkey Pelt mustered enough courage to approach the morose 
ogress. &#147;Lady Michiru? What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;Wrong? Wrong? Nothing&#146;s wrong ! I&#146;m a freak, the only prince available 
is gay, I keep getting soiled, the puss I have a crush on is an assassin 
hired to kill me and even though I&#146;ve been exiled from my own community, 
I&#146;m still bound to kill her by family law. If I don&#146;t, I&#146;ll be 
considered as a traitor by all my kin, hunted down and tortured to 
death! I&#146;m sure they don&#146;t even have proper hygiene regulations in jail! 
But there&#146;s nothing wrong with that! EVERYTHING&#146;S PERFECTLY FINE THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH!!!!&#148;

&#147;Oh good, I was getting worried!&#148; Donkey Pelt beamed.

Michiru pressed the back of her hand to her forehead. &#147;Oh Rage! Oh deep 
Despair! Oh Lust, my Enemy! Have I lived so long only to deserve such 
vile fate?&#148; She sighed tiredly. &#147;Why do I even bother...?&#148;

&#147;So, you still are attracted to Haruka?&#148; Ami asked matter-of-factly.

The ogress abruptly stopped while her cheeks flushed. &#147;Yes... I mean... 
No! I can&#146;t love her! She murdered my cousin!&#148;

&#147;Yeah, but she&#146;s so charming and classy and sexy...&#148; Donkey Pelt 
interjected dreamily. &#147;... And I&#146;m sure she&#146;s potty-trained!&#148; She added 
approvingly.

The three others face-planted.

&#147;Anyway...&#148; Michiru said when she recovered &#147;... She admitted she wanted 
to eat me, so I guess I have no choice, I&#146;ll have to face her!&#148;

Ami and Makoto blushed profusely.

--------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;Pumpkin-honeyyy!&#148; The old voice came muffled through the closed door. 
&#147;Guess what! I just found the tiny winny bikini I wore when I won the 
Miss Potatoe Beauty Contest! And it still suits me!&#148; A cackle that was 
meant to be a girlish giggle was then heard.

In abject terror, Pumpkin trashed on the bed she was cuffed to, 
desesperately pulling on the chains...
