<h1>Slayer and Shadow (part 8 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>        Faith sighed to herself softly as she went into the Bronze 
alone. Black hair fell around her face, the simple clothing she wore 
allowing maximum freedom of movement. She scanned the crowd for any 
signs of vampires, feeling a bit of relief as she saw the place was 
clean.

        &quot;What can I get you?&quot; Tara asked as Faith reached the bar. The 
slightly heavy brown haired young woman didn&#39;t even turn away from the 
glasses she was cleaning, somehow knowing that Faith was sitting there.

        &quot;Rum and coke,&quot; Faith ordered her regular. The drink was poured 
smoothly and as it was set down Faith asked, &quot;How did you know I was 
there?&quot;

        Tara smiled slightly, her expression kept carefully neutral. 
&quot;You have a distinctive scent around you,&quot; she explained.

        Faith took a small drink, pausing to listen to the sound of the 
ice cubes clinking together. &quot;That&#39;s the nicest way I&#39;ve ever heard 
someone say I stink,&quot; she noted.

        Tara&#39;s laugh was soft, her voice honestly amused as she said, 
&quot;Not stink, slayer. There&#39;s a delicate scent around you, of carved wood 
and holy water, along with that perfume you wear.&quot; A pause, &quot;It&#39;s a 
pleasant combination.&quot;

        Faith gave her a wary look, but decided not to argue that. She 
set her glass down delicately, &quot;You took Willow off, earlier tonight. 
Can you tell me what happened?&quot;

        Tara gave Faith a measuring look. &quot;We confirmed that Willow 
indeed has a soul,&quot; the wiccan said simply, &quot;but other than that, I&#39;d 
rather not say.&quot;

        &quot;I didn&#39;t see her or Buffy out again tonight,&quot; Faith mused, 
picking her glass up again. &quot;I wonder what happened once she got home?&quot; 
she asked.

        &quot;Not for me to say,&quot; Tara answered, her voice hard.

        Faith looked at her thoughtfully, then nodded slightly, &quot;Sorry.&quot; 
She didn&#39;t know what had angered Tara, but something had. Faith finished 
off her drink before asking for a refill. &quot;This place good for singles?&quot;

        &quot;Not bad,&quot; Tara poured the run first, then added two cubes of 
ice before topping it up with coke. &quot;Are you looking?&quot;

        &quot;Something like that,&quot; Faith quietly agreed. She picked up her 
glass, taking a little drink before smiling slightly, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She laid 
a bill down on the counter and slipped away into the crowd, not waiting 
for any change.

        Tara tilted her head to the side, watching the dark haired woman 
stride away. &#39;I wonder why I complimented her like that?&#39; she mused, 
taking a towel and wiping off the counter. There was something about 
this Faith, a feral beauty that she carried so well.

        The house band was only mildly good, the covers handled well, 
but the originals were a bit iffy. Tara found herself wishing that Oz 
and the Diego&#39;s were still around, but the intense young man had left 
town with his werewolf girlfriend after the Master had been slain.

        There was a soft shriek, and Tara spun around to scan the crowd. 
She puffed out an irritated breath, &quot;Clem!&quot; The dogfaced demon looked 
over at her sheepishly and Tara continued, &quot;What have I told you about 
scaring the customers?&quot;

        &quot;Sorry, Tara,&quot; Clem said, looking down in embarrassment.

        Tara sighed, he was such a loser that it was hard to stay angry 
at him for any length of time. &quot;Drink your drink and try to stay out of 
trouble, would you?&quot; she asked as she poured him his usual glass of 
whisky neat.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Clem reached to take the drink, but Tara stopped him.

        &quot;No tab,&quot; she firmly reminded him. Clem produced the money and 
Tara checked it over, &quot;Thank you very much, I know your reputation.&quot;

        Tara watched him go, shaking her head. Clem had been booted from 
the non-human bars for not paying his tab, as well as outstanding 
gambling debts. Personally, Tara didn&#39;t really care about him being a 
demon, but he was not going to run up a tab on her watch.

        &quot;Hi,&quot; the voice said from nowhere.

        Tara looked up and smiled, &quot;Hey, invisible girl.&quot; She poured a 
glass of scotch even as she asked thin air, &quot;You ever going to tell me 
your name?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not sure I even remember anymore,&quot; the voice said as small 
bills were placed on the counter. The glass was picked up, it hung there 
in midair, then disappeared.

        &quot;And I&#39;m not even going to ask where you got the money from, 
either,&quot; Tara said firmly. She wiped up a spill, &quot;Have you considered my 
offer?&quot;

        &quot;You really think the circle can help me?&quot; the voice sounded 
wistful.

        &quot;They&#39;ve dealt with a lot of strange stuff,&quot; Tara noted, &quot;from 
Moloch the corrupter on up. If anyone can help, they will.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; and the presence that Tara felt faded as 
the girl walked away.

        Tara fought back a sigh. Somehow, some combination of things had 
rendered the young woman invisible to everyone. The only reason Tara 
knew about her was because of her skills as a witch, her practice with 
seeing the unseen. She was oddly like a stray cat, skittish and nervous, 
and Tara had used patience and kindness to draw her out.

        &quot;Interesting place you got here,&quot; Faith noted, the taller woman 
navigating her way back to her seat. She looked curious, &quot;What&#39;s this I 
hear about this place once being a coffee bar?&quot;

        &quot;Once upon a time,&quot; Tara agreed, &quot;back before the Master took 
over, anyway. It closed up after awhile, and I acquired it more 
recently.&quot;

        Faith nodded to a corner, where a woman oddly dressed in a 
labcoat sat. Her brown hair was sprinkled with gray, and she had a 
bottle of red wine beside her, ready to refill her glass. &quot;What&#39;s her 
story?&quot; she asked.

        Tara hesitated, &quot;I don&#39;t know her name, we all just call her the 
Professor. She was involved in a government project out near Sunnydale 
called the Initiative.&quot;

        &quot;And?&quot; Faith asked, instantly sensing there was more to the 
story than that.

        &quot;The Initiative was intended to train soldiers to fight demons 
and other monsters,&quot; Tara said grimly, &quot;but they got tangled up with the 
Master&#39;s forces. He nearly destroyed the Initiative, and the feds cut 
funding because they thought it was useless.&quot;

        &quot;Poor lady,&quot; Faith said a bit more sympathetically.

        &quot;Don&#39;t feel too sorry for her,&quot; Tara said cynically, &quot;she was 
apparently building her very own Frankenstein&#39;s monster in the basement 
using selected demon parts.&quot;

        &quot;Well, ewww!&quot; Faith murmured. Tara had poured her another glass 
when she wasn&#39;t looking and Faith took another drink. &quot;This isn&#39;t a 
demon bar,&quot; Faith said, &quot;but you&#39;ve got quite the mixed bag of 
customers.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t hide the fact that I&#39;m a wiccan,&quot; Tara said mildly, &quot;so 
I think the more borderline customers don&#39;t mind coming in.&quot;

        &quot;That fits,&quot; Faith agreed, &quot;but do you think you&#39;ll loose 
customers now that the Master is gone and things are going back to 
normal?&quot;

        Tara surprised her with a laugh, &quot;How do you define normal? The 
city is still vampire and monster infested and it doesn&#39;t seem to be 
changing.&quot; A bit more seriously she continued, &quot;Sunnydale was built on a 
Hellmouth, one of the few in the world. It&#39;s a magnet for supernatural 
trouble.&quot;

        &quot;Giles gave me that lecture,&quot; Faith said with a slight smile, 
&quot;he was nearly giddy about the variety of things that turn up here.&quot;

        &quot;Watchers,&quot; Tara rolled her eyes.

        &quot;If it is so dangerous around here,&quot; Faith looked at her 
thoughtfully, &quot;why are you here? I&#39;d think most people with common sense 
would be gone by now.&quot;

        &quot;Someone other than the Watchers and Slayers need to be here to 
keep an eye on things,&quot; Tara said simply, &quot;someone with a different 
point of view.&quot;

        &quot;Fair enough,&quot; Faith got up, stretching. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, 
maybe,&quot; she said as she walked with feline grace to the exit.

        &quot;I thought you said you were looking for someone?&quot; Tara asked.

        Faith paused. She looked back over her shoulder and smiled, &quot;And 
I found the one I want, I think. Maybe tomorrow night.&quot; And with that 
odd statement she was out the door and gone.</pre>
