<a href="../nonanime/break-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Raven let her hand trail along Starfire&#39;s cheek.  The waxing moon was 
one night away from a full moon, and glimmered brightly on the calm 
water of the bay.  Yet again, Raven found herself on the roof of the 
Titan&#39;s Tower.  However, she was smiling slightly as she gazed at 
Starfire.  Starfire had found Raven meditating after the heady battle 
against Chaos and asked if she could join her.

Of course, Raven agreed.  The day had slipped quickly into night, and 
Starfire had pulled Raven to sit next to her on the edge of the roof.

&quot;I have always enjoyed looking at the stars,&quot; Starfire murmured.  She 
lay down, resting her head on Raven&#39;s thigh.  She looked up and smiled 
at the sorceress.

&quot;But I believe I enjoy looking at you more,&quot; she said, blushing a 
ridiculously adorable pink.  Raven smiled at her and passed her hand 
over Starfire&#39;s green eyes.  Starfire fell asleep easily with little 
help from Raven&#39;s persuasive magic.  The sorceress smiled at her 
fortune but paused when she heard footsteps.

Robin sat down next to her as he had done earlier that day.  He looked 
at Starfire somewhat forlornly and heaved a sigh.

&quot;I guess I&#39;ll have to get over her,&quot; he muttered.  &quot;There&#39;s nothing I 
can really do to change her decision.&quot;  He stared down at the water, 
gazing at the reflection of the moon.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure I really expected 
her to...well, I didn&#39;t expect her decision was going to be to be with 
you.&quot;

&quot;She never said anything about a decision,&quot; Raven sighed in turn.  &quot;She 
said that her feeling was right.  If her feeling means she cares about 
me, then I can&#39;t say I&#39;m unhappy about it.&quot;  Robin nodded slightly, not 
willing to look up and see Starfire with Raven.  He honestly knew that 
he was terribly jealous, but there wasn&#39;t really a way around that.  He 
stood up to walk away and stop tormenting himself.

&quot;Robin?&quot; Raven inquired before he could get too far.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; he replied.

&quot;I understand,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;And I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Robin rumbled softly, almost sadly.  He walked back into the 
tower and left the two girls to their own business.  Raven looked up to 
the moon and smiled faintly.  As Starfire turned in her sleep and 
mumbled, Raven smiled even more.

&quot;Raven,&quot; Starfire said in her sleep.  A faint smile also graced her 
lips, and Raven felt purely content.
