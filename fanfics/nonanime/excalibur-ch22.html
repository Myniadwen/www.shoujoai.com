<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Lisa Garrison groaned softly as hands massaged the
blonde&#39;s tense shoulders. &quot;Thanks love,&quot; she managed,
&quot;it&#39;s been a rough day.&quot;

Llyan gently stroked her skin, the willowy redhead
nearly sitting on her shoulders. &quot;What happened?&quot; the
sidhe asked, her smile gentle.

&quot;Bezerker from the Marauders,&quot; Lisa revealed, &quot;we got
a tip about him being in London and Pete got a few of
the team together.&quot; She sighed, &quot;He&#39;s a lot tougher
than I had expected, even from last time we fought.&quot;

&quot;Whomever grated him his abilities is a powerful
patron,&quot; Llyan noted as she worked gently on Lisa&#39;s
lower back, &quot;and with everything that has been going
on with Asgard...&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Lisa blinked.

&quot;There are rumors in the other realms that Asgard will
fall,&quot; Llyan said gravely, &quot;if that is so those who
were touched by it&#39;s power might become even more
powerful.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a unpleasant thought,&quot; Lisa sighed.

&quot;You and your friends are champions and warriors,&quot;
Llyan said as she finished, curling up beside Lisa on
the bed, &quot;whatever comes you will deal with it.&quot;

Lisa chuckled, &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re confident.&quot;

Llyan kissed her gently, then a little harder. &quot;You
have given me much cause, m&#39;love,&quot; she purred. She
batted her eyes, &quot;Would you care to show me your
prowess once again?&quot;

Lisa laughed as she pulled the slim woman to her, &quot;Oh
yes.&quot;

Kate Pryde shook her head as she heard Lisa and Llyan
getting busy next door. &quot;Those two are almost
insatiable,&quot; she commented, her silvery skin gleaming.

Rachel Summers lay there beside her, trying to catch
her breath beneath the sheets. &quot;And you aren&#39;t?&quot; she
asked wryly.

Kate snickered, &quot;Well, yes.&quot;

Rachel turned over, red hair falling into her eyes.
&quot;You know, I wish you had told me about how you felt
years ago,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Kate asked curiously, stroking a hand along
Rachel&#39;s cheek.

&quot;I never realized you were so skilled,&quot; Rachel said
softly, a blush coloring her cheeks. &quot;Were you ever,&quot;
she hesitated, &quot;with someone else?&quot;

Kate looked up towards the ceiling, her thoughts
drifting a bit. &quot;Not as often as you might think,&quot; she
answered honestly, &quot;I just have a very vivid
imagination.&quot;

Rachel blushed faintly. &quot;One hell of a imagination,&quot;
she conceded.

&quot;Why,&quot; Kate looked at Rachel impishly, &quot;were you
expecting me to have torrid affairs?&quot; Impishly, &quot;Or
hoping to hear about some? I could always make
something up...&quot;

&quot;No, that&#39;s not necessary,&quot; Rachel said firmly.

Kate just laughed.

Pete Wisdom scowled as he walked outside, looking up
at the starry sky. It wasn&#39;t that he minded Kate and
Rachel being happy together, but listening to them
together occasionally reminded him a bit too much of
when he had been with the Kitty of this era. Even
worse it reminded him of why they had broken up, all
the stupid arguments that led to it...

&quot;Well, at least you smoke those damn cigarettes
outside,&quot; Cecelia Renes muttered, the African American
doctor walking up in her labcoat.

Pete took a drag, tempted a moment to send a puff of
smoke towards her. &quot;What can I say,&quot; he shrugged, &quot;I&#39;m
polite, sort of.&quot;

&quot;That and it gives you a good excuse to be left the
hell alone,&quot; Cecelia said perceptively.

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Pete admitted. He gave her a look, black
hair falling into his eyes as he asked, &quot;So why are
you bothering me tonight?&quot;

&quot;Because you have been dodging your appointment for a
physical,&quot; Cecelia said dryly, &quot;do I have to drag you
into the infirmary?&quot;

&quot;Why do I need one?&quot; Pete asked weakly.

Cecelia growled, &quot;Wisdom, mutant powers are evolving
constantly. If your powers do shift I need a baseline
to track it.&quot;

Pete sighed softly, &quot;When do you want me in there?&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;d normally suggest now,&quot; Cecelia yawned
softly, &quot;but I&#39;m too tired.&quot; She gave him a smile,
&quot;I&#39;ll give you a reprieve till tomorrow, all right?&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Pete sighed.

&quot;You&#39;d better show up,&quot; Cecelia added, &quot;or I&#39;ll ask
Jackie to do a super-speed search of the island for
you.&quot;

Pete nodded reluctantly, &quot;You would, too. All right,
I&#39;ll be there.&quot;

Cecelia smiled, &quot;Good.&quot; She paused, &quot;So how did your
dinner with Jackie go?&quot;

Pete nearly spat his cigarette out I surprise, but he
managed to restrain himself. &quot;The rumor mill in this
place startles me at times,&quot; he muttered.

Cecelia chuckled softly, &quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;It went just fine,&quot; Pete said with as much dignity as
possible, &quot;until we got that emergency call for
Bezerker&#39;s rampage.&quot; He scowled as he took a furious
drag then said, &quot;An&#39; to be honest that stinks to high
heaven.&quot;

&quot;Bezerker&#39;s rampage?&quot; Cecelia looked over at him
thoughtfully.

&quot;Nobody except maybe Juggernaught runs around
rampaging like that anymore,&quot; Pete pointed out, &quot;no,
if he was caught that easy he wanted to be caught.&quot;

&quot;Of course the question of why rears it&#39;s ugly head,&quot;
Cecelia noted.

&quot;I&#39;m going in with Rachel to try to interview him in
the morning,&quot; Pete shrugged, &quot;maybe we&#39;ll get some
answers then.&quot;

Down below the young man known as Bezerker sat in a
modified containment cell, his sandy brown hair
falling into his eyes. Steve waited patiently as he
listened to the sounds of the island, watching
thoughtfully as he toyed thoughtfully with the pendant
around his neck.

Finally Steve pressed down on a back tooth, wincing a
bit at the sensation. &quot;You hear me boss?&quot; he murmured
quietly.

He didn&#39;t hear Codex&#39;s voice, it almost felt like it
rattled around in his bones. &quot;Where have they got
you?&quot; she asked quietly.

&quot;Detention cells beneath the island,&quot; Steve kept his
answers short, the mini-transmitter wasn&#39;t powerful
enough for sending long talks.

&quot;Has Wisdom interviewed you?&quot; Codex demanded.

&quot;No,&quot; Steve answered.

&quot;What the hell is the man thinking?&quot; Codex muttered. A
pause, &quot;Give him the information we discussed then
signal again, we&#39;ll bust you out.&quot;

&quot;Why are we doing this?&quot; Steve had to ask.

&quot;Because Sinister lied to us about this job,&quot; Codex
answered him grimly, &quot;and I don&#39;t take that from
anyone.&quot; She gentled her tone, &quot;Good luck, Codex out.&quot;

&#39;Back to waiting till morning,&#39; Steve thought glumly.
&quot;Hey,&quot; he yelled out to the hallway, &quot;Is there any
chance of getting fed?&quot;</pre>
