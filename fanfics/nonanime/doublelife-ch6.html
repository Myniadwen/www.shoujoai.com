<h1>Double Life (part 6 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jsyxx.html">J-Syxx</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/doublelife-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The scenery in Arecibo, Puerto Rico was made up of a beautiful, 
mountainous landscape covered with thick, green vegetation as far as one 
could see. It was suddenly interrupted seemingly out of no where by a 
huge metal construct that could&#39;ve only been scarred into the other wise 
perfectly natural landscape through the tinkering of human beings. The 
largest feature of this monument to mankind, the Arecibo Observatory, 
was the 1,000 feet wide, concave, aluminum dish that was built into the 
ground over a lime stone sink-hole. Suspended 450 feet above this dish 
was a 900 ton, triangular, steel platform. The platform was suspended in 
the air by eight-teen cables running from three reinforced concrete 
towers, one 365 feet tall and two 265 feet tall, which stood on the 
edges of the huge dish. Hanging below the triangular platform was a 
radio telescope named the Gregorian Dome. The Gregorian Dome had a 
polygonal shape, being composed of inter-connected, white triangles. It 
looked like a golf-ball sliced in half. There was also a slim, shaky, 
steel cat-walk. It led from the base of one of the towers on a cliff to 
the suspended, triangular platform.

Three people walked over this catwalk and one was carried. Sebastian 
lead the group, followed by Jerrell and Steve who was carrying Mandy 
still bound and gagged over his shoulder. Mandy struggled furiously to 
break free, but she was tied so tight that it was of little use other 
than annoying Steve as she wiggled around. They made their way onto the 
platform and took a zigzagging flight of steel steps down into a lower 
level that lead to the Gregorian Dome. They walked inside. The dome was 
hollow inside with a large hole at the bottom and a much smaller one on 
top.

Steve turned Mandy around so she could see in front of him. Sebastian 
turned to where a large box shaped room was located. He opened its door, 
revealing a mass of machinery and computers inside. Sebastian stared at 
her with his one human eye and his one, dark pit. &quot;This is the M1 
planetary radar transmitter. It was originally designed to direct radar 
waves at planets and other objects in space. With the help of some 
scientists I persuaded to assist me, I&#39;ve converted this machine to 
transmit my own signals to satellites orbiting earth. Embedded in this 
signal is a virus that will spread quickly to every electronic 
connection available to it. Once its unleashed it will be unstoppable, 
and every man, woman, and child in modern civilization will hear my 
album. &quot;

He then pointed downwards at a large, aluminum dish parallel to the hole 
in the floor. &quot;This is the tertiary sub-reflector. Tie her over the top 
of it like I told you.&quot;

Steve carried Mandy down onto the bottom of the dome and placed her on 
top of the curved piece of metal. Him and Jerrell untied some of the 
ropes and re-knotted them around pipes and surrounding metal. She was 
now stretched over it on her back, with her arms extended to the left 
and right and her legs downwards, forming a crucifix.

&quot;The tertiary sub-reflector collects radiation from space that reflects 
off of the big dish below, to the ceiling of this dome, and back down to 
it. No need to worry, this kind of radiation is harmless to humans. What 
you should worry about is the heaters I&#39;ve installed under this dish. 
When I&#39;ve activated the M1 Transmitter to charge for broadcast, the 
heaters under it will turn on. At first the heat will be relatively mild 
and harmless, but as time progresses towards broadcast time, you will 
start to feel a sensation that probably is only comparable to being on a 
frying pan. When broadcast time arrives, the heat will reach a deadly 
level and you will be literally cooked alive.&quot;

He stopped for a moment and continued, &quot;So now that you know how you&#39;re 
going to die, do you have any last requests?&quot;

&quot;MMMK...MMPH!&quot; Her words were muffled, but the intent was clear. Mandy&#39;s 
eyes burned with hatred.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t understand you.&quot; He turned around. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; They 
left the room, slamming the door behind them. Mandy stared up at the 
small ray of light that shone out of the hole in the ceiling, because it 
was the only thing she could do.

As the men reached the end of the cat-walk, a beeping noise sounded off. 
Sebastian pulled an electronic device out of his pocket. Its green 
screen displayed a 3D model of the Arecibo Observatory and the 
surrounding jungle. He pressed a button, and the image zoomed in on 
three yellow spots that moved together some distance off into the rain 
forest.

&quot;I should&#39;ve known they would insist on being early. Very well. We&#39;re 
going to move slightly ahead of schedule.&quot; He handed the tracking device 
to Jerrell. &quot;Find them and kill them. If you fail to finish the job this 
time, I&#39;m going to give both of you a complimentary copy of my album.&quot;

Steve and Jerrell looked like they had just received a message from the 
grim reaper himself. He may as well been. They had been very 
apprehensive of him ever since he revealed the other side of his face. 
&quot;Um, no sweat, Sebastian,&quot; Jerrell stuttered off.

Steve picked up the carrying cases for his two guitars which he left at 
the end of the cat-walk. The two men went in the other direction and 
started trekking for some time through the hilly jungle in the pursuit 
of the yellow spots. Steve stopped walking when they reached a small 
clearing nestled between two hills. His blue, electric guitar was now 
strapped to his chest. He pulled a cigarette out of his back pocket, lit 
it up, and started puffing on it.

&quot;You know that shit&#39;ll kill you, man.&quot;

&quot;Does it look like I care?&quot;

The electronic device started beeping again. &quot;Forget about that. They&#39;re 
right ahead of us.&quot;

The three spies appeared from behind the dark undergrowth.

Clover was the first to spot them. &quot;Great, it&#39;s the has-beens again.&quot;

&quot;Hey, watch how you talk to your elders, baby. You might receive a 
spanking.&quot;

Sam put her hands on her friends&#39; shoulders, &quot;Clover, Alex, you think 
you could take these two while I go find Mandy and Sebastian?&quot;

&quot;No problem, Sammy. We can handle these losers.&quot; Alex answered. Sam then 
ran behind them and out of sight.

&quot;Hey where you going honey?&quot; Steve said as he ran in her direction.

&quot;Away from you.&quot; Alex swiped her foot at his head. He managed to jerk 
his body back in time to miss the yellow blur as it flew right past his 
face and knocked the cigarette clean out of his mouth. He then started 
running his fingers and pick over his guitar strings, and the sonic 
energy burst out in Alex&#39;s direction. She responded by flipping her body 
up onto the arm of a tree. The white blast collided with the trunk, 
shaking it greatly. Steve kept playing while twisting the angle of his 
guitar upwards. The white energy tore away bark as it moved up the 
trunk, until it was blowing away leaves and branches at the top. By this 
time, Alex had already made a cat-like leap into another tree. Steve 
simply turned and blasted the other tree until it was bare of leaves 
like there was an approaching winter. When the energy stream came too 
close, Alex vaulted off the tree again. Before she hit the ground, she 
activated her jetpack backpack and swooped into the forest. Steve was 
lured by her, and they both disappeared into the thick undergrowth.

Clover eyeballed Jerrell, &quot;So you ready for round two?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m always ready.&quot;

&quot;Pshh.&quot; Clover rolled her eyes. &quot;Yeah, like I haven&#39;t heard that one 
before.&quot;

She lunged forward at him. Jerrell already had his microphone in hand 
and the green, energy burst out at her. She rolled to the side. He 
turned the mic in her direction, and she kept cart-wheeling out of the 
way as the rings collided with the hill behind her kicking up dirt. 
Finally, the shot ceased and Clover charged forward. He pulled out his 
hunting knife. She expertly spun her right foot around at his hand. The 
knife sailed in the air and stabbed into a tree some feet away. He fired 
again, but before he did Clover was fast enough to have grabbed his 
shoulders. She used the leverage to flip herself over him 360 degrees to 
where she kicked both of her heels at the small of his back. He grunted 
as he flew forward, tackling the ground.

Clover landed on the ground too, but was able to brace herself from the 
brunt of the fall. She got up as soon as she landed and ran in his 
direction. Jerrell saw this coming and rolled over, blasting the energy 
at her. She once again hopped clear of the danger and performed an 
amazing display of gymnastics as she maneuvered out of the way of the 
rings. The blast ran out again, and she charged at him ferociously. 
Jerrell pulled yet another mic from his back-pocket and fired that one 
at her with his left hand. This time Clover was quick witted enough to 
dodge the blast. However, just as that shot expired, he simply fired the 
other mic at her. This time it clipped her leg and she whirled in the 
air landing face first some feet away.

&quot;Where do you keep getting those things?&quot; Clover said, her frustration 
beginning to build. Getting tired of acting like a jumping bean, she 
turned on her jetpack backpack and soared to about fifty feet up in the 
air. Clover stuck out her tongue and yelled, &quot;Betcha can&#39;t hit me up 
here?&quot; Jerrell aimed his mic upwards and fired. Clover simply flew to 
the side easily dodging the green rings as they traveled into the 
atmosphere. When that stream of rings ended, he fired his other mic, and 
she easily dodged them in the air again. &quot;Awwww, you mis-fired again. 
How pathetic.&quot;

&quot;Yea, we&#39;ll see about that,&quot; Jerrell muttered to himself as he twisted 
the ends of his microphones. He pointed the one in his right hand 
directly at Clover. &quot;Check the technique.&quot; Clover simply flew to the 
left again, but this time the rings that shot out were blue, and as they 
traveled away from the head of the microphone they widened out in the 
air becoming quite large. Clover hadn&#39;t calculated on that occurring, 
and a few the blue rings hit her in the air, tossing her around. The 
blue rings weren&#39;t as powerful or as fast as the green, but they were 
still painful. While Clover was momentarily distracted, he fired the 
other mic. Red rings with very small diameters burst out, and they 
collided with her jet-pack, shattering its engine. Clover then dropped 
out of the sky and into a tree below.

Steve was strolling through the forest in search of Alex who had 
vanished a while back. He suddenly heard a &quot;whoosh&quot; sound behind him. He 
cocked his head just in time to see the yellow fist as it slammed into 
his face. His head was knocked to the side from the nasty blow but he 
managed to keep enough composure to strum his guitar. However, Alex 
veered sharply before she could be hit. He walked in the direction she 
had flown. She was no where to be seen. He kept pacing slowly, paying 
close attention to the tree tops and keeping an open ear for the sound 
of the jetpack. As he passed a particular tree, Alex materialized out of 
thin air on a high branch with her finger on her X-Powder turning off 
the camouflage. She stuffed it back in her pocket and then leaped down 
with her arms extended like a monkey. Her fall was broken by Steve&#39;s 
back. Steve was caught off guard, but managed to push his arms out in 
front to prevent himself from slamming into the ground and his guitar. 
Alex still on his back pulled on his long hair with one hand, while 
furiously landing a series of cross-face blows with her other. Steve 
managed to sit up, and grabbed Alex&#39;s shoulder guards flipping her over 
his head. He picked his guitar, but the energy only blew up dirt and 
grass, as Alex had already switched on her jetpack and flown sharply to 
the right again. He followed, but again observed nothing but jungle 
sounds.

&quot;Hide and seek, eh?&quot;

Steve started moving his fingers over the strings on the neck of his 
guitar, while also moving the whammy bar on its bridge up and down. The 
white energy burst out again. However, this time it was extremely wavy, 
matching the pitch of the guitar, and covered a much wider vertical 
area. He turned quickly from side to side and bathed the jungle with the 
energy waves. Several dead birds and frogs fell to ground from the 
trees, followed by Alex and her broken X-Powder.

Meanwhile, Sam zigzagged around tree trunks with her jetpack backpack at 
an intense speed. As she neared her destination, she could hear the 
distinct sound of organ music. It was a deathly dark piece of music. She 
stopped and planted her feet back on the ground when she approached the 
tree-line surrounding the observatory. She peered at the huge dish and 
telescope hanging over head. She didn&#39;t observe any immediate threats 
and reactivated her backpack. She flew over the enormous dish in the 
direction of the music. She reached the other end of the observatory 
where a long, white building stood. She hovered down and landed in front 
of a giant, gothic pipe organ that was set up on its roof. She could 
tell by the profile of the organist that it was Sebastian. He also had 
on a heart shaped jetpack backpack, the one he used to escape from 
WOOHP. He must&#39;ve heard her land, but he ignored her and kept on 
playing. He worked the keyboard with incredible speed with his one hand 
and moved numerous pedals with his feet. He had the organ customized and 
invented his own method of playing to compensate for his handicap. Sam 
also observed a large antenna attached to the side of it. Tired of being 
ignored, Sam walked up and kicked the stool out from under his feet. He 
didn&#39;t fall down, but simply snapped up to a standing position and 
finished the last note by slamming his fingers down hard on the keys 
letting them rest for a second, emitting a ghastly, dark sound. Finally 
he turned around and bore into Sam with his two faces.

&quot;The gig&#39;s up Sebastian. We&#39;re on to your plan.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re too late. This organ activated the transmitter which is now 
charging to broadcast my music. Your bitchy girl-friend and the rest of 
the civilized world have about twelve minutes before their fate is 
sealed.&quot; Hearing that, Sam reached into her back pocket and set a timer 
on her X-Powder. &quot;My revenge is final!&quot;

&quot;What happened to you was horrible, but you&#39;re a hypocrite. You became 
worse than them when you turned to crime and decided to take out your 
pain on innocent people!&quot;

&quot;No one is innocent. By nature humans are greedy, selfish, ignorant 
creatures who will trample over anything or anyone as long as it 
benefits their selves. They are the most dangerous of animals. I&#39;m doing 
this planet a favor.&quot;

&quot;I believe most people have good in them. How can you judge them unless 
you&#39;ve been in their shoes? You&#39;re not god, you have no right.&quot;

&quot;God is too slow. I&#39;m just giving him a helping hand to do what man was 
bound to do to himself anyways.&quot;

&quot;But what about you? What happened to the boy who just wanted people to 
love his music? Don&#39;t you remember what it was like to feel something 
other than hate? It&#39;s not too late, you can still stop this madness.&quot;

&quot;That boy is dead. He was murdered by the inherent evil of mankind. The 
only way you&#39;re going to stop my revenge is by going through me first.&quot; 
He then jabbed out his metal claw towards her head at lightning speed. 
Sam did the splits, sinking out of the way of the blow. She lunged out 
her fist and drove it into his stomach hard. Sebastian only reacted in 
pain for a second before he drove his knee forward for her head. Sam 
laid down her back to avoid his knee, and then kicked both feet up at 
him. They didn&#39;t connect, and instead he grabbed both of her legs and 
slung her over so she collided with the wooden side of the pipe organ. 
It contacted the side she had injured yesterday, and she doubled over in 
pain. Sebastian took advantage on this and grabbed her head by the roots 
of her hair. He then dragged her in front of the pipe organ and slammed 
her face down on the keys. He grinded her head on them, causing a loud, 
dark noise to escape from the pipes. He picked her head back up to slam 
it down again, but Sam jabbed her elbow hard into his chest, while also 
lifting her fist up to slam into his nose. She then grabbed his head and 
drove it into the organ keys in retaliation, and the ghostly pipes 
sounded again. While his head was still down on the keys, Sebastian 
slashed his claws at Sam&#39;s arm. Sam gripped it as blood started pouring 
out.

Sebastian took this moment to turn on his jetpack backpack and ascend 
into the air. Sam activated hers and pursued him. As she did so, she 
pulled out a piece a cloth, wrapped it around her arm, and tied the knot 
with her teeth. Sebastian flew up a few hundred feet towards the top of 
one of the concrete towers. There was a small, square platform right 
below its peak. Sebastian landed on it, and disappeared around the 
corner. Sam landed on the same spot. She turned the corner but was met 
by Sebastian wearing sensible soundproof earmuffs and holding a black 
boom-box in front of him. The boom-box emitted rock music. Sam was never 
a big fan of Rock, but for some reason the combination of guitar, bass, 
and percussion was oddly beautiful to her ears. She found herself no 
longer able to move under her own power, and soon everything in front of 
her eyes began to swirl into a circle of colors.

Jerrell pulled the tracking device back out, and observed the location 
of the yellow spot representing Clover. He trekked through the jungle 
until he came to where the spot was and looked up. There was the red 
uniformed blonde hanging limply on a branch by her mid-section.

&quot;Timber!&quot; He blasted the small, red rings across the tree&#39;s trunk. The 
energy stream was short, but it was much stronger than the other 
settings, cutting through the tree like a buzz-saw. Clover suddenly 
regained liveliness and somersaulted off of the branch landing in a 
crouching position gracefully, as the tree crashed to the ground behind 
her.

&quot;You still haven&#39;t finished me off,&quot; Clover said as she again stuck her 
tongue out at him.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I always get the job done.&quot; He fired the string of 
razor-like rings at her with the other mic. She dodged the fast 
onslaught, but it clipped her hair and yellow strands fell to the 
ground.

&quot;My hair!&quot; Clover screeched. &quot;No one touches the...&quot; They both then 
noticed the blast had sliced another tree in half, and they both dodged 
out of the way as it crashed to the ground.

&quot;You know I don&#39;t think they pay lumberjacks by the hour,&quot; Clover said 
as she positioned herself in front of another tree, while pulling 
something out of her back-pocket. &quot;But wait, I take that back. You&#39;re 
too short to be a lumberjack in the first place, small fry.&quot;

She hit a sore spot. &quot;You&#39;ll be even funnier when I have your head for a 
paper-weight, you blonde bimbo!&quot; he shouted angrily. He shot the red 
rings at her again. She did a baseball slide out of the way, but at the 
same time fired her laser lipstick at his belt. The belt sliced in half, 
and his pants fell to his ankles exposing his pink boxers. When he 
instinctively tried to jump out of the line of the falling tree, he 
tripped to the ground. &quot;I can&#39;t go out like....&quot;

Thud!

Steve looked over at the motionless Alex. She was sprawled out on the 
ground like she was dead. &quot;Yeah, right,&quot; he said not fooled for a 
second. He then put his hand back on his whammy bar.

&quot;Hi-ya!&quot; Alex kicked off her boot and it slammed into his family jewels. 
She was planning to hit his head, but her aim was off.

&quot;Ughhhh, not again,&quot; he moaned in pain. &quot;I&#39;ll kill you!&quot; He started 
moving the whammy bar and the strings.

&quot;Ahhhhhhh!&quot; Alex started running as fast as she could, with the tall, 
sonic waves trailing right behind her. They were inching extremely close 
to her butt so she turned on her jetpack and started flying. Steve kept 
turning around in a circle to follow her as she whizzed around him. 
Eventually, she made so many laps that he got dizzy and fell over. He 
sat on the ground with the world still spinning around him. When things 
finally straightened out he looked around and realized Alex was no where 
to be seen. Alex had flown straight up and was hovering above him. She 
then started a descent and pulled the sensible sound proof earmuffs out 
of her back pack. She threw them down and they snapped right onto his 
head and over his ears. He put his hands on his head to feel what it was 
and took off the earmuffs. He then noticed he could hear a faint buzzing 
sound from behind. He turned around to see Alex waving. &quot;Peek-a-boo.&quot; 
Alex cart-wheeled to the side, and her puppy-dog shaped boomerang 
buzzsaw barrette collided with his guitar. It sliced through the stings, 
and Steve was pushed back as all the pent up sonic energy burst out 
forward from it. After it was expelled, it looked like a meteor hit with 
all the trees knocked down and grass blown away directly in front of 
Steve.

Dazed, he un-strapped the now useless guitar and threw it to the ground. 
He looked around and saw Alex was again missing. He knew he had to 
hurry, so he started running back through the rain forest in the 
direction he had first come. He ran for quite some time, but fatigue 
began to kick in as he started wheezing and coughing hard. He was so 
winded, he had to walk the rest of the way back to where he had stashed 
the item he was searching for. As he turned around a certain tree he met 
her again.

&quot;Looking for this?&quot; Alex said with his bass strapped to her chest.

She started to walk forward. &quot;No wait, don&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t what?&quot; She continued walking towards him completely oblivious of 
the branch in front of her. It ran across the bass and plucked a string.

&quot;Heinouuuuuuusss!&quot; That was the last word uttered by Steve as a burst of 
the dark, sonic energy hit him and shot him up into the sky like a 
canon. He kept traveling over the skyline until he was out of sight.

&quot;Oops!&quot; She couldn&#39;t believe what she just did. &quot;Sorry! I hope you 
live,&quot; she said sincerely.

The colors were still swirling around Sam&#39;s eyes. The swirl started to 
get smaller and smaller as it twisted into itself. Soon she could see 
nothing but darkness. Eventually, blurry colors began to reappear in 
front of her, and they materialized into people. It was her mother and 
father standing tall over her motioning with their arms, telling her to 
come to them. She tried to walk forward, but she was clumsy and was only 
able to take a few steps before she latched onto her father&#39;s leg to 
prevent herself from falling. &quot;She walked, can you believe it?&quot;

Her mind started rolling through more events from the past. Happy times 
she had spent with her mom and dad as a young child. Eventually, she 
reached the point where her family moved to California for her father&#39;s 
job, and Sam started school at Beverley Hills Elementary. She was very 
lonely during the first few months there. None of the kids there seemed 
to want to associate with her, especially since she was the teacher&#39;s 
darling, answering all the questions in class and always getting high 
grades. One day she found herself sitting in front of a tree crying 
during recess, because a boy had called her an ugly nerd. She looked up 
to see much younger versions of Clover and Alex smiling at her. &quot;Do you 
want to play with us?&quot; Clover asked. She did. They soon bonded, quickly 
becoming best friends. The girls stopped treating her so bad, because 
Clover was the most popular girl in class who they all envied and wanted 
to be friends with. The boys still picked on her for a time, but when 
she started to mature that subsided as well. She saw more happy times 
with Clover and Alex, her parents, and the first time she kissed a boy.

The next significant thing that flashed into her mind was a short time 
that up until recently seemed so distant and foreign. Like a fragile 
flower that had been buried under a mound of dirt, she had almost 
completely forgotten about it. When Mandy first arrived at Beverley 
Hills Elementary, she seemed really shy and uncomfortable. She mostly 
kept to herself and ate by herself at lunch. However, she was soon 
befriended by Clover, Alex, and Sam much in the same way Clover and Alex 
had befriended her. They hung out together during and after school. 
Mandy still had her annoying voice, but she seemed a lot nicer during 
those days. She could remember again now how Mandy was very friendly to 
her in particular. She was always complimenting Sam and hugging her 
whenever she got the chance. One time she whispered into her ear, 
&quot;Sammykins, I really like you. You know that?&quot; She was still a bit na&#139;ve 
back then, but she could only remember appreciating the attention from 
her. Mandy and Clover also got along real well. Their interests in 
fashion, shopping, and other such things were almost identical. Sam 
thought they had found a new best friend to add to their circle.

However, this friendship was cut brutally short only after a few weeks. 
Clover&#39;s then beloved boy-friend, Bobby, had lost interest in Clover and 
became infatuated with Mandy. Sam could see now that Mandy had little to 
no interest in him, but Bobby was persistent in pursuing her anyways. 
Eventually, Clover caught wind of this, and she interpreted it as 
betrayal by her new friend. Perhaps, it would&#39;ve blown over and they 
would&#39;ve patched things up. However, they got into a shouting match and 
Clover uttered the words, &quot;You&#39;re so nasty, I bet your parents don&#39;t 
even love you.&quot; This was just something she said randomly with very 
little thought or meaning. However, Mandy took it personally, and she 
could see now how the words deeply affected her. From that point on, the 
battle lines were drawn. Mandy became very spiteful of Clover, and their 
ridiculous popularity wars and boy-chasing contests commenced soon 
after. Sam and Alex sided with Clover, because they were friends with 
her first for a much longer time. However, Sam now felt regret over that 
decision to choose sides. She didn&#39;t recall Mandy having any real 
friends after that. She was surrounded by a few girls, but they only 
seemed to be shallow politicians more drawn to her popularity than 
anything else. Clover had always been the most popular up to this point, 
but eventually Mandy managed to surpass her. Clover doubled her efforts 
and reclaimed her throne. So it went back and forth for years. The 
friendly girl she could barely remember was gone, and she was replaced 
by the more infamous version who was bratty, arrogant, self-absorbed, 
and over-all nasty to Clover and anyone that was near her. Pretty soon, 
Sam began to despise her almost as much as Clover did. One thing she 
could see now though was that the odd, far away looks Mandy gave her 
from time held a different meaning.

Her mind kept running though more times and events. She saw when the 
three of them first became spies under the tutelage of Jerry. She 
watched her first successful and not so successful missions against 
villains of the likes of Macker the Safe Cracker and others. Being a spy 
was hard work but it usually managed to turn out fun at the same time. 
It strengthened her bond with Clover and Alex, and she felt a great 
sense of accomplishment from being able to help people. More time 
passed. She had more fun times with Clover and Alex, went on more 
missions, and dated more boys. Eventually, it caught up to only a few 
days ago. She was at Mandy&#39;s house to work on their science project but 
instead they just talked privately for hours. She honestly couldn&#39;t 
remember feeling more intimate with anyone else. Then the moment came 
when Mandy stole a kiss from her.

At that moment, the images in her mind started spinning back into a 
swirl of colors. Eventually the swirl straightened out, and her blurry 
vision came back into focus as she re-entered the present. She felt the 
sensation of her head convulsing, but it shortly subsided. She took her 
hands off her head, which had placed on the sensible soundproof 
earmuffs. She must have some how managed to do this subconsciously. It 
seemed like she was gone for a life-time, but in reality it had only 
been a few minutes.

A metal claw than shot out for her head, but she took her hands, 
grabbing it at the wrist, and used it to throw Sebastian up over her 
head and off the platform to the 300 foot drop below. She viewed the 
boom-box which was still playing. She ejected the CD in it and snapped 
in half in her hand. She took off the earmuffs. Hearing a buzzing sound 
moving upwards, she whirled her leg around just as he came up over the 
edge, kicking the burnt portion of his face. He whirled back, and Sam 
took this opportunity to dive over the edge and tackle him mid-air. She 
then landed several punches across both sides of his face. Sebastian 
retaliated by kneeing her in the stomach. He then chopped both of her 
shoulders, and kicked her on her way down as she plummeted towards the 
hard aluminum below. About 200 feet down, she switched on her jet-pack, 
which halted her free-fall. She flew back up in pursuit of Sebastian.

Sebastian landed on one of the thick, steel, bridge cables that ran from 
the tower, to the suspended steel platform. Sam landed in front of him. 
Sebastian delivered several blindingly quick kicks hopping down the 
cable, keeping one leg on it at a time. Sam blocked every one of them, 
and followed up with her own string of kicks. He blocked each of those 
with his arm and claw. As Sebastian jabbed his metal claw forward, 
ducked down and activated her jetpack. She clothes-lined his mid section 
moving like a bullet, and grabbed him, carrying him into a downwards 
plunge. She started flying at a curved angle to prepare to drop him onto 
the dish while diving back up, but he wrapped his claw around her neck 
and started to squeeze. Sam lost her ability to navigate, and they began 
spinning out of control. They almost hit the ground, but Sebastian used 
his human hand to flip off the switch on the back of her jetpack. He 
then turned on his own and hovered down to stand on the aluminum. He 
held his claw up in the air still choking Sam. She kicked him hard, but 
he didn&#39;t even flinch and tightened the steel grasp around her trachea 
even more. Sam tried to kick again but her legs suddenly felt limp as 
she was ran out air. Trying to pull apart the steel vice with her bare 
hands was futile too.

&quot;I want to see you suffer, just like your girl-friend is suffering right 
now,&quot; he said demonically.

She moved her right hand up to the claw again like she was going to 
struggle to break off the hold, but instead she used her thumb to switch 
on the laser-lipstick concealed in her hand to its highest setting. The 
red beam melted through his wrist like a hot knife through butter. She 
dropped to the ground with the severed claw still wrapped around her 
neck, while at the same time spraying the laser once over the un-scarred 
side of Sebastian&#39;s face. Sebastian screamed, and put his hand over that 
side of his face.

Sam finally managed to latch the claw off of her neck, and sucked air 
into her lungs greedily. She was caught off guard when Sebastian&#39;s foot 
flew into her hand, causing the laser-lipstick to sail off into the 
distance.

He removed the hand from his face. Steam rose from the hideous gash of 
melted flesh. His other eye-ball had melted too, leaving both his eyes 
as black holes. He started laughing hysterically. &quot;You think that would 
stop me? That was the dead side!&quot;

&quot;Rahhhhhhh!&quot; Sam howled as she swung both her arms around, with the 
metal claw gripped like a baseball bat. It impacted the side of his face 
that was burned years ago. His head twisted from the blow, and he 
collapsed to the ground unconscious.

Sam fell to her hands and knees, exhausted from the fight.

&quot;Sam, are you ok?&quot; Clover yelled from a distance as she and Alex ran 
over to her.

&quot;I&#39;m fine, but I don&#39;t know where Mandy is.&quot; Her voice sounded scratchy 
and panic stricken.

&quot;Did you look inside that big golf ball?&quot; Alex asked. Sam saw that 
Steve&#39;s bass was strapped to her chest.

&quot;Of course!&quot; She pulled out her X-Powder and opened it up, the timer she 
set on it read 2 minutes and 6 seconds. &quot;We don&#39;t have much time. 
Clover, I want you to carry Sebastian out of here.&quot;

She looked at the hideously disfigured man, &quot;Um, Ewwww....&quot; Her 
expression got more serious. &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

Sam handed Alex her X-Powder. &quot;Here, Alex, you have to destroy that 
golf-ball before this reaches zero, whether I come out of it in time or 
not.&quot;

&quot;Ok Sammy, just go save Mandy,&quot; Alex told her.

&quot;Hurry back, Sam,&quot; Clover said.

Sam didn&#39;t respond, not wanting to spend any more time. She turned on 
her jetpack and soared up into the air and through the hole in the 
bottom of the Gregorian Dome telescope. She hovered in the center and 
looked around.

She saw her, &quot;Mandy!&quot;

Mandy had her eyes closed with her head arched up, because it was the 
only part of her she could move away from the burning. When she heard 
that voice, she opened her eyes and saw her floating above her. She 
still couldn&#39;t talk because of the bandana that gagged her, but the 
tears that poured down from her purple eyes were enough to communicate 
the message to Sam.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m here to rescue you,&quot; she said now crying herself. She 
hovered down to the tertiary sub-reflector. When she touched it, she 
pulled her hand back. It felt like the inside wall of an oven. &quot;Oh my 
god!&quot; Sam pulled off the dolphin shaped boomerang buzzsaw barrette from 
her hair and flicked out the blade. She then furiously slashed at the 
ropes that bound her to the disc, and they all severed with one swipe 
each. Mandy still couldn&#39;t move anything other than her arms. Sam 
scooped her off the hot metal, not caring how it burned herself, and 
held her in her arms. &quot;Mandy. We&#39;re going to jump through that hole and 
I&#39;m going to fly you safety. Hold on tight, ok?&quot; Mandy wrapped her arms 
around Sam&#39;s right shoulder tightly and laid her head down against her 
left. She jumped down through the hole. After a short drop, the flame 
shot out of her backpack, sending them up into the sky. Alex saw them 
escape to safety from her position in the air. She didn&#39;t hesitate in 
running her fingers sloppily up and down the strings of the bass. The 
dark, think energy thundered out of it and collided with the triangular 
platform, tearing the metal apart. The Gregorian Dome fell to the center 
of the dish and smashed like an egg. Alex kept pounding the debris for 
good measure, and the aluminum was ripped apart as it was blown into the 
underlying sinkhole. Two of the concrete towers suddenly crumbled, and 
huge chunks of rock fell on top of the mass of twisted metal, leaving it 
a scene of utter destruction.

Sam landed some distance away in what had been a parking lot for 
scientists and engineers. She laid Mandy down and continued untying the 
ropes that bound her. Finally, she unknotted the bandana.

&quot;Sammy, I thought I&#39;d never see you again!&quot; She yelled as she jumped 
into her arms. She latched onto her and sobbed deeply and loudly into 
her shoulder.

&quot;It&#39;s ok Mandy. And I promise you it&#39;s going to be ok from now on. I 
don&#39;t care what anyone else thinks about you. I don&#39;t care how you act 
sometimes, because I love you.&quot;

Mandy looked up, tears still streaming down her cheeks. &quot;Do you really 
mean it?&quot; She never expected to hear those words from her lips.

&quot;Absolutely.&quot; Sam dove in with her lips in and kissed her passionately. 
Mandy reciprocated, and they shared each other&#39;s saliva and salty tears.

Clover and Alex approached from behind. &quot;Sam thank god you&#39;re ok! I tied 
up Sebas... Wha..... Wha.. Wha. Wha.&quot; Clover&#39;s eyes rolled back in her 
head, and she slumped to the ground. Sam and Mandy pulled their lips 
apart and looked at the blonde on the ground. The look on her face was 
one of utter bewilderment.

Alex kneeled down and placed two fingers on her neck. &quot;It&#39;s ok. She&#39;s 
not dead, only unconscious.&quot;

&quot;Well, I guess you know now. You think you&#39;ll be ok with it?&quot; Sam asked 
Alex with nervous anticipation.

&quot;Sam you&#39;re my best-friend. Nothing&#39;s ever going to change that. And I 
just want you to be happy. If you love Mandy, that&#39;s fine with me.&quot; She 
looked down at the incapacitated blonde. &quot;... and I&#39;ll make sure Clover 
gets used to it too.&quot;

Sam ran up and hugged her. &quot;Thank you so much. You don&#39;t know what this 
means to me.&quot;

&quot;Oh Alex, I can&#39;t believe I was ever mean to you,&quot; Mandy said.

&quot;It&#39;s ok Mandy. I forgive you. Friends?&quot;

Mandy extended her hand, &quot;Friends.&quot; However, Alex walked right past her 
hand wrapped her up in a warm hug instead. Mandy accepted it and hugged 
her back. &quot;I just have one question.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;Why are you all dressed up like total weirdoes?&quot;

&quot;Mandy, I&#39;m sorry. I haven&#39;t been telling you the whole truth about me. 
I, Alex, and Clover are international spies for WOOHP, the World 
Organization of Human Protection. We fight people like the man who 
kidnapped you to keep the world safe.&quot;

&quot;Spies huh? Is that why you can fly? Are you sure you&#39;re not an angel?&quot;

Alex snickered. &quot;No, Mandy, I can fly because of my jetpack backpack. 
I&#39;m not an angel,&quot; Sam explained.

&quot;Well, I still don&#39;t believe you.&quot;

That moment the girls&#39; hair was blown back, as several Chinook style 
helicopters landed on the parking lot. Jerry walked out of one of them, 
followed by several buff men in black-suits and sunglasses.

&quot;I have to congratulate you girls on a great job. You&#39;ve made me proud 
today. And I think after this mission, you all deserve an extended 
vacation. It&#39;s the least you deserve for saving the world.&quot;

&quot;All in a day&#39;s work, Jerry,&quot; Sam said showing off a bit in front of 
Mandy.

&quot;Excuse me, but what&#39;s wrong with Clover? Is she injured?&quot;

&quot;Um, she&#39;s just taking a nap. It was a long day for her,&quot; Alex 
explained.

Sam took Mandy&#39;s arm and walked her up to Jerry, &quot;Jerry, I&#39;d like you to 
meet my girl-friend Mandy. Mandy this is my boss, Jerry.&quot;

They shook hands. &quot;Very pleased to meet your acquaintance, although I&#39;m 
sorry I can&#39;t say it&#39;s the first time,&quot; he said in a congenial tone.

&quot;Um... Hi.&quot;

Sam then grasped Mandy&#39;s hand and led her towards the med-copter. &quot;What 
was that creepy, old, butler guy talking about? I&#39;ve never seen him 
before in my life.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a long story. I&#39;ll tell you about that and everything else, but we 
need to get you fixed up first.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t look bad do I?&quot; To most people she probably never looked worse.

&quot;You look beautiful, Mandy.&quot;

In the chopper, they returned to the passenger area after about two 
hours. It had taken that long to treat all their wounds. Mandy&#39;s 
extensive burns took the lion&#39;s share of the time.

&quot;Hey you two,&quot; Alex said glad to see them.

&quot;Hi Alethh..&quot; The dose of morphine Mandy had taken was beginning to take 
effect. Barely being able to stand, she latched onto Sam&#39;s side as Sam 
helped her walk. Sam led her to a chair and helped her sit down. &quot;It 
stings! It stings!&quot; She jumped back into Sam&#39;s arms.

Sam gave her a short kiss and then led her to a couch. &quot;Here, sit on you 
stomach, hon.&quot;

She laid down. &quot;Guess I&#39;m going to be doing this for a while.&quot;

Sam sat down next to her and motioned for her to lay her head down in 
her lap. Mandy gladly nuzzled her cheek down on her thigh. &quot;Well, it 
won&#39;t be so bad. I&#39;ll be the one nursing you back to health,&quot; she said 
as she began to run her fingers through her silky, black strands.

&quot;Oooh, I can&#39;t wait,&quot; she said dreamily.

They were quiet for a few minutes before Mandy spoke again. &quot;Sammykins?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mandy?&quot;

&quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;I know you do, sweetie. And I love you too.&quot; Mandy smiled and at that 
moment she started snoring, which for her was a combination of snorting 
and whiney sounding whimpering.

&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Alex then lowered her voice so she didn&#39;t wake up Mandy. 
&quot;We have to go back.&quot;

Sam stopped staring at Mandy, and looked at Alex concerned. &quot;Why? We 
stopped Sebastian didn&#39;t we,&quot; she whispered.

&quot;No, not that. We forgot Clover.&quot;

And there Clover laid, abandoned in a parking lot in the middle of a 
jungle, comatose with a dumbfounded expression on her face, as hot air 
blew by and rustled her hair.

The End

Thanks for reading.

Also thanks to Psychedelic Leviathan because I ripped off dialogue for 
this chapter hard from his story &quot;California Dreamin.&quot; He also let me 
use the name Delaroyale from his fics.
