<h1>X-Factor: Xavier Covert Operations</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The briefing was simple, thankfully, but the man who was standing there 
giving it still felt a bit nervous, anyway. &quot;The keyword to remember,&quot; 
Pete Wisdom said as he addressed the room, his black hair and matching 
suit nearly making him almost appear to be a shadow in the dark room, 
&quot;is plausible deniability.&quot;
 
Vanessa shook her head, the ghostly pale young woman&#39;s lips twisted up 
in a sneer. Her multicolored hair fell about her face as Copycat said, 
&quot;Cover your ass.&quot;
 
&quot;Essentially, yes,&quot; Pete agreed seriously. &quot;Back in the old days nobody 
knew who the X-Men were so they could act without much restraint. If a 
new Sentinel project was about to launch they could go in and thrash the 
place, mostly without any trouble.&quot; Pete flashed a smile, &quot;Now that the 
teams have been outed, however, if they pull something like that the 
feds will be knocking on the mansion door in a few hours, if not 
sooner.&quot;
 
&quot;Which is where we come in,&quot; Alex Hayden said crisply from where he sat, 
smoothly cleaning a shining pistol. A bold x-shaped scar marked his 
face, that and the protective set of sunglasses he wore identifying him 
as Agent X. He put the pistol down, &quot;We get sent in to do all the dirty 
jobs, the ones the X-men can&#39;t be involved with.&quot;
 
&quot;Almost sounds fun,&quot; Maverick commented, the black and gold armored 
mercenary standing to one side with his girlfriend, the Russian telepath 
Elena. His artificial eye shone even under his metallic half mask, short 
brown hair slightly messy.
 
&quot;You have a interesting definition of fun, love,&quot; Elena shook her head, 
her blonde hair falling around her face. She wasn&#39;t wearing a costume, 
just casual clothes, but as the groups resident telepath she really 
didn&#39;t need one.
 
&quot;We won&#39;t have any official name,&quot; Pete said, &quot;and your pay will be 
channeled through various shell companies. The X-men will deny we even 
exist, and everyone involved are either former teammates or were never 
X-men in the first place.&quot;
 
Stacey-X chuckled, her reddish skin mostly exposed in the skimpy clothes 
she wore, her tattoos standing out boldly on her skin. She ran a hand 
through her short hair, &quot;So what sort of jobs are we going to be doing?&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;ll vary,&quot; Pete responded, &quot;everything from simple data gathering to 
sabotage and even direct assault on soft targets.&quot;
 
&quot;And your job?&quot; Alex asked seriously.
 
&quot;I&#39;m the cut-out,&quot; Pete explained to them seriously, &quot;the agent that can 
be officially disavowed by the X-men if we are discovered.&quot; He paused a 
second, &quot;Of course, if we are discovered the kind of people we&#39;ll be 
crossing will make sure we&#39;re dead.&quot;
 
&quot;I can hardly wait....&quot; Stacey muttered.
 
**********
 
 
The sex party out in the Mutant Town district of New York was already 
jumping when Stacey had entered, sweeping the room with her eyes. A girl 
with multiple breasts was letting several young men and women suck on 
them, her legs twitching as she came from the sensation. Copycat was 
imitating Madonna over in a corner, giving a handsome young man a 
devastating look even as she gave him a devastating blow job.
 
&#39;Sure, she&#39;s never been in the business,&#39; Stacey thought sarcastically, 
even though she still appreciated having some backup.
 
Around the room various sexual acts went on, men and women coupling in 
every imaginable was and in a few that surprised even the jaded Stacey. 
Still, she was here for one thing and as soon as she spotted it she 
moved. The blonde looked elegant, even remote in her stylish red dress 
as she coolly observed a gang-bang, puffing on a cigarette as she 
watched the girl moaning at her feet.
 
Michelle Wilson was a researcher and designer, mostly circuitry and 
internal architecture for androids and was working on a government 
black-project. Even Wisdom&#39;s sources couldn&#39;t get much, but what they 
did find out was troubling. Some of the information indicated they were 
studying the Prime Sentinel technology, among other things.
 
&#39;Which is why I&#39;m here,&#39; Stacey thought. She carefully modulated her 
pheromones, releasing a mild sexual scent coupled with a gentle 
relaxant, something to soften people up a bit. &quot;Friend of yours?&quot; Stacey 
asked curiously as she reached the blonde&#39;s side, gazing down at the now 
semen splattered young woman laying on her back on the floor.
 
Michelle chuckled softly, taking a drag of her cigarette as she said, 
&quot;No, I just find this kind of thing interesting to watch.&quot; She gave 
Stacey a look, studying her thoughtfully as she softly murmured, &quot;And 
aren&#39;t you.... exotic.&quot;
 
Stacey smiled slightly as she could almost see the woman&#39;s pulse jump, 
her already simmering sexual excitement beginning to boil from her 
influence. The girl laying on the ground rolled over on her knees as she 
lapped up the cum on the ground with obvious pleasure, her catlike tail 
swishing as she cooed softly, looking up at her male suitors adoringly.
 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Stacey said as Michelle reached out to tentatively touch 
her face, tracing the slightly scaly feel of her flesh. &quot;So do you just 
like to look,&quot; she asked the other woman curiously, &quot;or do you plan to 
play?&quot;
 
Michelle&#39;s nipples poked up against the front of her blouse, her eyes 
glazed just slightly as she left her hand on Stacey&#39;s bare shoulder. &quot;I 
normally just watch,&quot; she admitted to Stacey huskily, &quot;it&#39;s safer, but 
you&#39;re so....&quot;
 
Stacey moved a bit closer, letting her subtle scents wash over the other 
woman, raising her sexual excitement another notch. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; 
Stacey purred as she reached out to tough the other woman&#39;s throat, then 
slid down to cup a breast possessively, &quot;I&#39;ll be gentle.&quot;
 
Michelle flushed, reaching up to cup Stacey&#39;s hand and firmly press it 
to her flesh. &quot;Not gentle,&quot; she hissed out, &quot;please.&quot;
 
Stacey let her fingers twist and pull at the nipple, Michelle moaning 
deep in the back of her throat. &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; Stacey tugged 
gently on the nipple, leading the other woman away towards one of the 
side rooms, &quot;do you ever play... mistress and slave?&quot;
 
Michelle did her best to keep up in her high heels, her breath ragged. 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Michelle blushed charmingly, &quot;occasionally.&quot;
 
&#39;Why do I think it&#39;s more than occasionally?&#39; Stacey mused as she opened 
the side door, seeing a thankfully empty bedroom.
 
Elena&#39;s amused voice echoed in her mind, &#39;No luck involved, I&#39;ve been 
using telepathic suggestions to keep people out.&#39;
 
&#39;Any luck piercing Michelle&#39;s mental shields?&#39; Stacey asked as she 
firmly pushed Michelle inside, slapping the beautiful woman&#39;s ass as she 
went by.
 
&quot;Ah!&quot; Michelle gasped, stumbling slightly.
 
&#39;They&#39;re artificial but strong,&#39; Elena answered, &#39;she&#39;s going to have to 
be very distracted for me to slip through them.
 
&#39;I think I can manage that,&#39; Stacey thought with amusement as she pulled 
Michelle into a forceful kiss, her hands roaming possessively over the 
taller woman&#39;s body.
 
&quot;Oh Mistress,&quot; Michelle moaned as a tongue lapped at her throat, biting 
down on heated flesh. Stacey squeezed a breast hard then clasped her 
bottom, roughly mauling her body.
 
&quot;I like the sound of that,&quot; Stacey purred as she roughly pulled at her 
dress, yanking the cloth away from Michelle&#39;s body, &quot;slave.&quot;
 
Michelle cried out passionately as her breast was bit, a harsh tongue 
swishing across her round breasts. Roughly she was shoved backward, 
bouncing on the bed even as Stacey paused, slowly pulling her own 
clothes away, enjoying the hungry gaze that Michelle was giving her.
 
&quot;Oh come here,&quot; Michelle whimpered, &quot;please!&quot;
 
&quot;Beg for it,&quot; Stacey purred as she studied the young woman, feeling heat 
rushing through her own body at the unexpected pleasure of dominance.
 
&quot;I&#39;m begging you,&quot; Michelle moaned, her dress hanging on her lush body, 
&quot;Mistress.&quot;
 
&quot;Just what I wanted to hear,&quot; Stacey smiled as she slid across 
Michelle&#39;s body, moving her hand down over her skin to reach silken 
panties before simply tearing them away.
 
&quot;Oh my god....&quot; the little blonde moaned, her legs spread wide as silky 
fingers slid into her wetness. Her dress was messily shoved aside, her 
bra yanked off by her own busy hands. She pulled wildly on her nipples, 
mewling softly as she waited for more.
 
Stacey kissed her even as she let her mutant gift go to work. Pheromones 
filled the air, amping the sweet young thing&#39;s sex drive and clouding 
her thoughts. &#39;Not that it needed much clouding anyway,&#39; Stacey 
admitted, plunging her fingers into the soaked cunt.
 
&quot;Oh Mistress!&quot; Michelle bucked wildly, thrusting up and down on those 
stiffened fingers, writhing on the mattress as she cried out her 
pleasure.
 
&#39;I&#39;ve got the codes,&#39; Elena&#39;s voice rang in her mind, &#39;you&#39;re done.&#39;
 
&#39;Go away,&#39; Stacey shot back as she bent to kiss Michelle, practically 
raping the woman&#39;s mouth with her tongue, &#39;I&#39;m busy.&#39;
 
**********
 
 
Maverick and Agent X watched in satisfaction a few nights later as the 
Sentinel research base went up spectacularly in a series of explosions. 
The access codes got them in, computer viruses erasing everything in the 
companies mainframes even as the explosives totaled the Sentinel 
prototypes. &quot;So how long did it take to get Stacey out of there?&quot; 
Maverick asked curiously.
 
Agent X chuckled, &quot;Looks like she made a friend, she was there for 
hours.&quot;
 
&quot;Think that&#39;s why Stacey wanted us to made sure the baddies didn&#39;t find 
out it was Michelle&#39;s codes that got us inside?&quot; Maverick raised a 
eyebrow.
 
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Agent X laughed.
 
To be continued...?
 
Character notes for any non-X-men fans. Stacey X was a former prostitute 
as well as a X-man for a short period of time, Copycat was introduced in 
X-Force and Deadpool but hasn&#39;t been seen in a while, Pete Wisdom was 
from Excalibur and finally Maverick and Elena were both from X-Men, 
Wolverine and the Maverick series.
 
The idea of the X-Men forming a covert ops group seems like a good move, 
considering the current situation in the comics. Mystique is already 
doing that style of thing in her title, but one person alone can&#39;t 
easily do everything.... I may continue this in some form, it&#39;ll depend 
on how inspired I get.</pre>
