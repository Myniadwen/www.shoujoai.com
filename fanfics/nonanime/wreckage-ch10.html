<h1>Avengers: Wreckage (part 10 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/wreckage-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&quot;Are you sure it&#39;s a good idea to have our
headquarters so near your employees?&quot; Warbird asked,
the blonde dressed in her usual black and gold
uniform.

Olivia Stane smiled back calmly as the jeep they were
in bounced a bit, heading towards the rear of the
Stane Enterprises lot. &quot;We have more than adequate
security,&quot; the nearly white haired woman answered,
&quot;and the building is as far away from regular staff as
I could manage and still be on the property.&quot;

&quot;None of us want to see innocents hurt,&quot; War Machine
said firmly, the black and silver armored figure
sitting by Olivia in the driver&#39;s seat. She and Olivia
were up front, with Warbird and Thunderstrike in the
back seat, talking loudly over the wind.

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Thunderstrike agreed, her long black
hair blowing in the breeze, her Asgardian style garb
resembling armor from another era. The chainmail shirt
fit her tightly to reveal well shaped breasts, black
leggings tucked into golden boots and a bold red cape
finishing off the look.

A squarish three storey building soon came into view
behind a carefully planted strand of trees, with a
high gate around it. A harmless red laser beam washed
over them and the jeep for a second or two as they
came up to the gate, then with a soft beep the door
slid away to let them go up the drive.

Painted white it had a office look rather than a
residential, with windows all around the first and
third floors. It was reasonably large, probably with
the sort of space a smaller office building might
have, and from the looks of things they had just
finished some kind of renovations to the facility.

&quot;Sorry about the dust,&quot; Olivia said as she got out of
the jeep, the slight breeze on this bright and sunny
day stirring up the dirt left over from construction,
&quot;we only finished work a few days ago.&quot;

&quot;You built this facility specially for us?&quot;
Thunderstrike asked curiously.

Olivia&#39;s eyes twinkled with amusement, &quot;Well it was
going to be my and Jennifer&#39;s love shack, but I
thought you could use it more.&quot;

&quot;Olivia!&quot; War Machine sqwaked.

Warbird fought back a chuckle as they went up to the
double doors, also noting Thunderstrike&#39;s blush.
&#145;Wonder what that&#39;s all about?&#39; she thought.

Another security scan washed over them as Olivia said,
&quot;We wanted to make the facility as secure as possible.
In the reconstruction titanium reinforcement was added
to the outer walls, as well as other improvements.&quot;

The scan stopped and the door unlocked with a soft
sound. &quot;The security scan is automatic,&quot; War Machine
noted, &quot;and we&#39;ll also issue you special pass cards
for the system. We hope you&#39;ll be comfortable using
the facility in your off hours too.&quot;

&quot;So this is going to be our superhero clubhouse as
well as headquarters?&quot; Thunderstrike asked with
amusement.

&quot;Actually, there is a pool table,&quot; Olivia smirked as
they went inside, &quot;and a decent recreation room.&quot;.

The main entrance way was a large chamber, nearly two
stories tall, with a polished tile floor that gleamed.
Three doors led off of it, one at the back and two
smaller doors to the right and left. The rear door led
into another large room, with a round table and
comfortable business style chairs waiting. A
sophisticated computer system was up against one wall,
a radio broadcasting rig as well as a coffee and
espresso machine.

&quot;Coffee?&quot; Warbird smirked.

War Machine flipped up the face plate of her armor as
Jennifer Swensen smiled, the redhead looking sheepish.
&quot;I&#39;m a bit of a addict,&quot; she smilingly confessed, &quot;I
insisted on at least having good coffee.&quot;

&quot;You should see her in the mornings,&quot; Olivia smiled
cheerfully as she made up a coffee and a cup of tea,
&quot;just a grumpy ol&#39; teddy bear.&quot;

Thunderstrike had to fight hard at hiding her
amusement on seeing the two women together. She had
met gay people before, of course, who in New York
hadn&#39;t, but these two took the cake. &quot;May I?&quot; she
asked, going to the espresso machine.

&quot;Help yourself,&quot; Olivia addressed both her and
Warbird.

Fetching a water from a mini-fridge Warbird took a
seat, soon followed by Thunderstrike and War Machine
with their coffees and Olivia with a cup of tea. &quot;So,&quot;
Warbird addressed them, &quot;how do we want to organize
this?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re team leader,&quot; War Machine said promptly.

&quot;Miss?&quot; Warbird looked questioningly at Olivia.

&quot;Your internal organization is up to you,&quot; Olivia said
promptly, &quot;my intention is to stay hands off your
operations.&quot; A smirk, &quot;Just consider me your sugar
daddy. Or mommy.&quot;

Thunderstrike nearly choked on her coffee with that
remark while War Machine scolded her lover. Again.
&quot;What else is in here?&quot; she asked, changing the
subject.

&quot;Rec room, training hall,&quot; War Machine said briskly,
&quot;a public relations office and mini-studio, as well as
a full kitchen and living quarters if needed.&quot;

&quot;PR office and studio?&quot; Warbird raised a eyebrow.

&quot;This is LA,&quot; Olivia noted.

&quot;Good point,&quot; Warbird conceded.

&quot;We&#39;ll also have one or two staff members here at all
times,&quot; War Machine added. &quot;In addition to monitoring
police band and keeping us updated to emergencies,
we&#39;ll also have cleaning staff and a cook, too.&quot;

&quot;Do we really need a cook?&quot; Thunderstrike looked
surprised.

&quot;I usually get takeout,&quot; Warbird admitted after a
moment.

War Machine looked amused as she drank her coffee, &quot;I
can make instant noodles with the best of them. And I
do a mean kraft dinner.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Olivia shrugged, &quot;I have a professional cook
at home for a reason.&quot;

Thunderstrike shook her head, &quot;Okay, we need a cook.&quot;

&quot;Miss Stane, I...&quot; Connie said as she strode in from a
side door. &quot;Oh, everyone&#39;s here,&quot; she said brightly.

&quot;You&#39;ve all met Connie I trust,&quot; Olivia smiled as the
brown haired woman hurried over to the table, &quot;she&#39;s
one of the staff who volunteered to help run your
headquarters.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t listen to her,&quot; Connie joked, &quot;we&#39;re slave
labor. Anybody who pisses her off at the office has to
work here with you all.&quot; With that she winked impishly
at Thunderstrike.

Warbird blinked, faintly surprised at the flash of
jealousy that wink caused. &#145;What the hell?&#39; she
thought, trying to figure out her odd reaction.

&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;d exile a capable employee like you,&quot;
Thunderstrike teased back with a little smile.

&quot;You&#39;re such a charmer,&quot; Connie laughed.

Warbird fought the uncharitable urge to get Connie
away from Thunderstrike by force. &quot;So what will you be
doing for us, Miss Leeds?&quot; she asked a bit flatly.

Connie looked up at Warbird with eyes that were first
surprised, then worryingly perceptive. &quot;In addition to
my normal personnel duties I had experience with the
police,&quot; a smile, &quot;I was a volunteer dispatcher. I&#39;d
like to do similar duties with you, if I can.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have a rotating group of volunteers,&quot;Olivia
added, &quot;including both Connie and myself.&quot;

&quot;I thought we were going to talk about you
volunteering?&quot; War Machine asked, giving her girl
friend a pained smile.

&quot;We are,&quot; Olivia flashed a smile, &quot;but you know I&#39;m
going to win that argument.&quot; A smirk, &quot;As a last
resort I can always withhold...&quot;

&quot;Olivia!&quot; War Machine squeaked.

&quot;TMI,&quot; Connie blushed.

&quot;Way too much information,&quot; Warbird found herself
chuckling. She turned in her seat to gaze out a window
at the trees within the fenced off yard as she
thought, &#145;This is going to be an interesting job.&#39;

&quot;So, should we see the rest of the building or...&quot;
Thunderstrike asked into the awkward moment of
silence.

BA-WOOGA!

&quot;What the...?&quot; Warbird jerked as the loud siren
pierced the room.

Connie leapt from her chair and raced to the computer.
&quot;That only goes off it there&#39;s a superhuman crime
reported,&quot; she jumped into the chair, &quot;and officers on
scene have requested assistance.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Olivia asked as her lover War Machine
flipped her face plate down and readied herself for
action.

Connie pulled on a headset hanging on a hook,
&quot;According to this it&#39;s those high tech thieves the
Raiders. They&#39;re hitting the bank on 41st and Oak.&quot;

&quot;Shall we?&quot; Warbird asked as she lead the way to the
door.

&quot;Let&#39;s,&quot; Thunderstrike agreed as she and War Machine
followed her out.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Olivia murmured.
