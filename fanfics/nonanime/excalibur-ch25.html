<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>That&#39;s when the alarms went off.

&quot;Now what?&quot; Pete demanded, the black haired man
turning to the monitor screen. The icons for Brittania
and the WHO chopper remained undisturbed, instead a
emergency beacon blazed red in the heart of London,
flashing away ominously.

Spitfire was accessing the board before anyone else
could move, the white haired woman moving at a blur.
&quot;Superhuman conflict reported,&quot; she read, &quot;and
according to this it&#39;s some of the members of the
Marauders.&quot;

&quot;So they&#39;re NOT hitting the copter?&quot; Kate raised a
metallic eyebrow, the silver skinned woman looking
curious.

&quot;Or this is just a distraction,&quot; Rachel suggested
quickly, the redhead frowning. &quot;Is it the whole team
or just...?&quot;

&quot;Police reports say it&#39;s Sienna Blaze and Rusty
Collins,&quot; Dani Moonstar said as she stepped up to the
screen, the native American continuing calmly, &quot;I&#39;d
bet on them trying to draw us away.&quot;

&quot;But we canna&#39; ignore it, either,&quot; Wolfsbane murmured
with a grimace, Rahne Sinclair standing close to her
lover.

Pete crushed out a cigarette, eyes hard as he thought.
&quot;Rachel, you Dani and Rahne get to check it out,&quot; he
said seriously, &quot;that way we hold me, Kate, Jackie and
Llyan in reserve for when the rest of the Marauders
hit the copter.&quot;

&quot;Coo!&quot; Lockheed protested, the dragon swooping down at
him.

&quot;You too, you handbag,&quot; Pete growled at it, &quot;stay
here.&quot;

Kate rose up into the air, her metallic body glowing
then in a burst of rainbow light opened up a teleport
gate. &quot;Be careful, love,&quot; she said to Rachel softly.

&quot;Always,&quot; Rachel gave her a grin as she stepped
through with Rahne and Dani.

The sounds of sirens wailed as the three figures
materialized on the road, cobblestones broken beneath
their feet as fires raged in the background. The
buildings were battered, a few shops wrecked and all
around them panicked crowds raced along wildly.

Dani took charge almost immediately, the black haired
woman&#39;s voice determined, &quot;Marvel Girl, scan for Blaze
and Thermal, Rahne...&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Rahne nodded. Wolfsbane shifted from reddish
haired girl to red-brown furred wolf, nose sniffing
the ground. &#39;No trace of their scents, but there&#39;s
something else here,&#39; her voice echoed in Dani&#39;s mind
through the special mental link they shared.

Dani knew that tone of voice meant trouble. &#39;What?&#39;
she asked.

&#39;I recognize the scents of Scalphunter and Harpoon,&#39;
Rahne&#39;s mental voice was grim, &#39;from the original
Marauders.&#39;

&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Dani muttered aloud.

&quot;Got &#39;em!&quot; Marvel girl pointed west as she added,
&quot;They&#39;re badly panicked, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re faking
that.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Dani ordered and the three raced through
the rubble even as she quickly reviewed what she knew
about their foes.

Scalphunter was, like her, of Native American descent
but that was where the similarity ended. A
semi-professional killer he had been a friend of
Gambit&#39;s before being recruited by Mr. Sinister, who
provided him with physical enhancement and a
remarkable modular weapons system. Using various
components attached to his uniform he could assemble
weapons for a variety of targets, from human to super
human.

Harpoon was a Inuit fisherman before Sinister got a
hold of him, tinkering with his DNA. Using his
namesake he had the deadly ability to convert matter
into energy, throwing harpoons of deadly energy
against his enemies. In the X-Men&#39;s first battle with
the team he had nearly killed Rogue and had trapped
Kitty in her phased state for months.

&#39;The problem is,&#39; Dani thought, &#39;they&#39;ve both been
reported dead.&#39;

Of course that didn&#39;t mean much when dealing with a
geneticist and expert on cloning like Sinister. In a
raid on a New York lab of Sinister&#39;s Gambit and Beast
had fought against a Sabertooth clone, one still wet
from the cloning tanks. It seemed that the Marauders
had achieved a kind of serial immortality, new clones
being released each time the last ones died.

They came around a corner then all three jerked in
surprise before leaping into action. Thermal and Blaze
were back to back as a group of black clad figures
tried to attack them, full face masks and armor
sealing the troops bodies away. Thermal threw waves of
flame to drive them back but they seemed unaffected,
even as Blaze casted energy bolts.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Blaze yelled, the blonde looking clearly
frustrated, &quot;these things aren&#39;t human!&quot;

&quot;Keep going,&quot; Thermal yelled, his reddish hair falling
into his eyes as the pyrotechnic ignited a foe ahead
of him.

&quot;Where are...&quot; Rahne asked as she shifted to her half
human, half wolf form.

&quot;There!&quot; Rachel pointed up to a rooftop where
Scalphunter and Harpoon watched all the goings on
coldly.

Dani assessed the situation quickly then made up her
mind. &quot;Wolfsbane, try to help them,&quot; she nodded
towards the desperately fighting pair then looked to
Rachel, &quot;Marvel Girl and I&#39;ll take Harpoon and
Scalphunter.&quot;

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Rahne said to Dani softly then raced
forward, her claws raking across the back of one of
the faceless goons.

&quot;Got a plan?&quot; Rachel asked as they ran forward.

Dani drew her bow and fired, a psionic arrow soaring
unerringly into Scalphunter. He screamed, clutching
his head as it reverberated in him, sending him to his
knees. &quot;Get us up there and we&#39;ll improvise,&quot; she
answered.

&quot;As always,&quot; Rachel gabbed Dani telekinetically and
they soared up to the roof as Harpoon threw. As soon
as the spear left his hands it flared to life, a bolt
of energy whizzing across to Rachel before splashing
on her shields.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Harpoon muttered before raising his wristband
to his lips. &quot;Sir, we have X-Men ion scene, please
advise.&quot;

&quot;Shit,&quot; Rachel cursed, trying to grab him
telekinetically but to her shock her grip slid off.
Some kind of protective shield kept her power at bay,
and even more shockingly his mind was like a blank
wall to her.

&quot;You failed to eliminate Codex&#39;s operatives,&quot; the
voice was cold, purely emotionless, &quot;you know the cost
of failure.&quot;

&quot;Sir, you don&#39;t need to...&quot; Harpoon sounded
frightened.

BOOM!

&quot;What the hell,&quot; Dani breathed out in surprise from
where she had reflexedly ducked behind Rachel&#39;s
telekinetic shield.

Only a crater remained where the two villains had
stood, smoke curling up from broken concrete and
stone. No tatters of uniform or anything else was
there, the force of the explosion had literally wiped
them from the face of the Earth.

&quot;Moonstar!&quot; they heard Rahne call and both young
ladies quickly joined her on the street.

The faceless minions seemed to be dissolving within
their uniforms, the black cloth and armor sagging as
whatever was within them turned to slime. &quot;I&#39;ll be
damned,&quot; Rachel nudged the empty costume then looked
up warily at Thermal and Blaze.

&quot;That was closer than I&#39;d like,&quot; Thermal sighed,
running a hand through his hair. He gave Wolfsbane a
faint smile, &quot;Thanks for the help, by the way.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d ha&#39; done it for anyone,&quot; Rahne said a bit coldly.
Once upon a time they had been teammates in the New
Mutants, and it was clear she was unhappy with his
changing sides.

&quot;A falling out among thieves?&quot; Dani asked with a
raised eyebrow.

&quot;No,&quot; Blaze said to them crossly, &quot;it looks like
Sinister has decided to eliminate anyone that connects
him to the raid here. I think he&#39;s decided to kill us
new Marauders with the original versions.&quot;

Rachel gave her a skeptical look but said, &quot;I&#39;ll pass
that on telepathically to Wisdom.&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; Thermal nodded to Blaze and they moved off.

Dani summoned another psionic arrow as she said, &quot;Hold
it right there.&quot;

Thermal didn&#39;t turn to her as he said, &quot;I&#39;ve got
teammates in trouble, they may even be killed by
Sinister&#39;s creations. I&#39;m not sticking around.&quot; With a
gesture he flung a burst of flame at them, using the
distraction to get himself and Blaze away.

&quot;I can follow,&quot; Marvel Girl offered, rising off the
ground telekinetically.

&quot;Let &#39;em go,&quot; Dani stopped her. She smiled grimly, &quot;I
may not like it, but I can respect why they need to
go.&quot;</pre>
