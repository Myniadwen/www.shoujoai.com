<h1>Excalibur: Crystal London (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/crystalondon-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Rachel, do you have to look so good all the time?&quot; Kitty sighed, the 
brown haired teen pulling on a simple skirt and top combo as she and the 
other ladies changed for their first night out in a long time.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Rachel Summers smiled, the redhead pulling on a stylish green 
dress that hugged her every curve, &quot;some of us just can&#39;t help it.&quot;

&quot;Rachel,&quot; Meggan chided. She wore a modified version of her usual 
costume, her golden one piece changed by Rachel&#39;s telekinesis into a 
simple looking one piece dress. In fact the blonde shapeshifter hadn&#39;t 
even planned to change, but both young women had managed to convince 
her, eventually.

&quot;Kitty,&quot; Rachel moved to hug the other girl quickly, &quot;one of these days 
you&#39;ll learn you&#39;re good looking in your own way.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Kitty sighed, straightening out her dress.

Meanwhile in the other section of the battered train Kurt Wagner smiled 
as he adjusted his black tuxedo. &quot;It was kind of the Crystal Londoners 
to lend us a clothes replication device,&quot; the blue furred mutant noted, 
adjusting his tie.

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Alistaire Stuart admitted, the brown haired scientist 
having settled on wearing a variation of his Weird Happenings 
Organization dress uniform for the night&#39;s activities, a dark brown and 
gold design that suited the scholar, mostly.

&quot;Worried?&quot; Brian Braddock asked, the muscular blond hero adjusting his 
suit collar a bit nervously. Despite being from a respected and powerful 
family, the former scientist wasn&#39;t terribly comfortable in such 
clothes.

&quot;No, not really,&quot; Alistaire admitted after a moment&#39;s thought. &quot;I think 
I&quot;m just eager to see such a unique future era.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s certainly a step up from most of the futures we X-Men have seen,&quot; 
Kurt noted as he finished checking his cufflinks.

&quot;A utopian rather than dystopian one,&quot; Alistaire nodded.

&quot;Remind me not to buy a X-men belt buckle,&quot; Brian noted with a wry 
smile, &quot;it sounds rather unhealthy.&quot;

&quot;Like being a British superhuman champion is?&quot; Kurt teased.

&quot;Feh,&quot; Lockheed noted with amusement.

Rachel firmly knocked on the door then called out to the men inside, 
&quot;All right boys, you ready to go?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Allistaire opened up the door to let them in, his eyes 
almost automatically falling on the lovely Rachel.

&quot;Sorry Kitty.,&quot; Rachel murmured as Kitty growled softly in annoyance.

&quot;Well,&quot; Nightcrawler said briskly, &quot;shall we go?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s,&quot; Kitty smiled back, deciding to not worry about how every guy 
she liked was attracted to Rachel instead. &#39;Besides,&#39; she thought as 
they headed out of the train, &#39;I can understand why, darn it.&#39;

Outside of the train, a large car rested on the green grassy field they 
had crash landed on, the odd yellow cab having no wheels, thought the 
cabbie himself looked perfectly normal. &quot;Welcome aboard, folks,&quot; he said 
in a thick Yorkshire accent as he popped all four doors open with a 
gesture, &quot;next stop, Tower of London.&quot;

&quot;Is that really your normal accent?&quot; Brian asked him as they all climbed 
in the oversized vehicle, him, Alistaire and Kurt on one row, Meggan, 
Kitty and Rachel on the other.

In a bit more neutral accent the driver grinned as he replied, &quot;Nah, all 
but the tourists seem to like it.&quot;

&quot;Hurh,&quot; Lockheed muttered as the dragon settled on Kitty&#39;s shoulder for 
the ride.

Smoothly the taxi rose up off the ground, then with a soft hum it raced 
across the grass to a nearby road. As they followed the road into London 
Kitty and the others gazed out eagerly, almost like tourists. While much 
of the city had been preserved, ultramodern crystal structures were 
mixed in with buildings from centuries past, crating a odd patchwork 
quilt of a city. A gleaming modern hospital rested beside a old 
apartment block and later English homes mixed with shops of many 
periods.

&quot;So,&quot; Alistaire wondered aloud, &quot;the city deliberately preserved as much 
of the historical structures as possible?&quot;

&quot;In between a war or two,&quot; their driver noted. &quot;Some o&#39; the structures 
are replicas, too, but we preserved as much as we could.&quot;

&quot;Remarkable,&quot; Alistaire murmured as he enjoyed the view.

They arrived shortly at the new Tower of London, a gleaming structure of 
crystal that soared nearly as high as the royal palace itself. 
Explaining that the trip had already been paid for the driver left, 
giving them a cheery wave goodbye as he drove off.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; a well dressed door man nodded to then as the group gawked at 
the massive structure as descretely as possible. &quot;I believe Sir Hellsing 
is awaiting you.&quot;

&quot;Sir?&quot; Kurt blinked.

&quot;She&#39;s a knight,&quot; Kitty whispered as they went in, moving forward into a 
large, circular lift, &quot;and I suppose she didn&#39;t want to be called dame.&quot;

Smoothly they were carried up, the levels of the tower flashing by until 
they stopped automatically at the right place. Instead of opening into a 
hallway the lift dropped them directly into the center of a large room, 
teeming with fantastic figures of all shapes and sizes.

&quot;We are honored to introduce Excalibur,&quot; a young woman in a militaristic 
uniform declared as they entered, &quot;adventurers from elsewhen.&quot;

&quot;Ah, welcome,&quot; the white haired vampiress Integral Fairbrook Wingates 
Hellsing said with a smile, &quot;let me introduce you around.&quot; Dressed in a 
evening gown she looked both sexy and elegant, something everyone on the 
team noticed.

&quot;Thank you for having us,&quot; Brian nodded to her respectfully as they 
mingled with the busy crowd.

&quot;We should be thanking you,&quot; a older, grey haired man noted, dressed in 
a stylized red uniform, one that looked like a odd combination of the 
fifties and the far future, &quot;these parties get a bit dull with the same 
old people.&quot;

&quot;Dan Dare,&quot; Integral introduced him quietly.

Alistare&#39;s eyes widened and he stepped forward to shake his hand. &quot;Mr. 
Dare,&quot; he said respectfully, &quot;it&#39;s a honor to meet you.&quot;

&quot;Best leave him alone,&quot; Rachel noted with some amusement as scientist 
and future man fell into conversation.

AS they passed through the crowd conversations were struck up, men and 
women of similar temperments finding bonds of conversation. Time 
traveller Halo Jones and Rachel were soon talking over drinks, Brian and 
the head of the city watch, Sam Vimes, shared a cigar and chatted, and 
so on and so forth. Finally Kitty and Integral stopped by a window, 
gazing out as the sun set over London.

&quot;The view is incredible,&quot; Kitty confessed after a moment, seeing the 
flying cars zipping in between the towers of crystal and steel visible 
from this high up.

&quot;I&#39;m more interested in hearing about your adventures,&quot; Integral 
admitted, smiling charmingly at Kitty.

Hesitantly at first, then with more confidence Kitty sketched in their 
adventures, both as X-Men then later with Excalibur. Some of their more 
humorous adventures even had the serious looking Integral chuckling, and 
Kitty felt a odd surge of pleasure from that.

Finally Kitty chuckled in embarrassment, &quot;I&#39;m babbling, sorry.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Integral shook her head as they moved to a smaller room with less 
people, &quot;I find your life fascinating.&quot; Maneuvering over to a couch they 
sat down as Integral studied Kitty a moment. &quot;I might be rude in 
saying,&quot; she said as a server dropped off glasses of wine, &quot;but you seem 
oddly unaware of your beauty.&quot;

Kitty actually blushed a bit, &quot;I&#39;m not...&quot;

Integral pushed up her chin carefully as she met Kitty&#39;s eyes with a 
tender gaze. &quot;Very beautiful,&quot; she said, &quot;though I wish I could make you 
see that.&quot; She drank a bit as she speculated, &quot;Feeling a bit 
overshadowed?&quot;

&quot;A little,&quot; Kitty admitted, &quot;Rachel...&quot;

&quot;The blonde?&quot; Integral guessed.

&quot;Redhead,&quot; Kitty shrugged.

Integral sat back, crossing her legs and not incidentally letting her 
skirt ride up a bit. &quot;To be honest she&#39;s not my type,&quot; Integral 
admitted. She swirled the last of her wine around her glass, &quot;Obvious 
has never been my style.&quot;

Kitty drank some of her own glass of wine, surprised at how comfortable 
it felt sitting there with her. &quot;So what is your style?&quot; Kitty asked 
curiously, even though she suspected she knew the answer already.

&quot;Quiet intelligence,&quot; Integral answered as she leaned forward, &quot;coupled 
with remarkable beauty.&quot; Giving Kitty plenty of opportunity to back away 
Integral moved to kiss her, and smiled when Kitty met her, lips pressing 
to lips.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Kitty purred softly as Integral kissed her lingeringly, her lips 
tasting of red wine, Gently the other woman rubbed her shoulders, 
pressing their bodies together tenderly...

&quot;Get away from her, fang face!&quot; a voice roared, and the moment was 
suddenly shattered.

BOOM! In a burst of telekinetic energy Rachel ripped Integral away from 
Kitty, the fire like energy signiture of the Phoenix crackling around 
her. But before she could press her advantage a blonde raced in and 
hammered her away, then Seres Victoria pulled out her pistol and fired 
away. As people ran away screaming the other members of Excalibur raced 
in, seeing the growing chaos.

&quot;Look out,&quot; Brian threw himself in the way automatically, his 
invulnerable flesh blocking the bullets easily.

&quot;How dare you,&quot; Integral picked herself up from where she had been 
thrown, her eyes glowing a eerie red. With a gesture her body shifted, 
arms becoming eerie black extensions of night that she used to tear at 
the startled Rachel.

Before Brian could invole himself Seres was there, the smaller blonde 
cracking her knuckles after putting her gun away. &quot;I&#39;m your dancing 
partner,&quot; she said, racing in to attack.

&quot;Kitty,&quot; Meggan hurried over even as Kurt bamfed in, &quot;are you all 
right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Kitty waved off a offer to help herself up, &quot;but we&#39;ve got 
to stop them.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Kurt looked surprised.

&quot;She wasn&#39;t hurting me,&quot; Kitty growled, &quot;Rachel overreacted!&quot;

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Alistaire winced as a lamp broke, the four super beings 
clawing at each other with dangerous intent.

Halo Jones lit a smoke as she watched the fight with some interest and 
suggested, &quot;Best just let &#39;em wind down.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t do that,&quot; Kitty said, watching the combat warily.Phasing to 
protect herself from crackling black energy or telekinesis Kitty raced 
into a opening, got between them and yelled, &quot;Break it up!&quot;

&quot;Kitty?!&quot; Rachel stopped, surprised.

&quot;Ray, she wasn&#39;t doing anything to me I didn&#39;t want her to do,&quot; Kitty 
gave Rachel a hurt look then turned to Integral. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; she 
said.

Integral reformed her arms, her expression more amused than anything 
else. &quot;Your friends&#39; loyalty does you credit, Kitty,&quot; she said as she 
lip up a cigar.

Rachel gave Kitty the oddest look as she turned to Integral, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
ma&#39;am. Obviously I misunderstood.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll repair the damage and apologize to the owner,&quot; Brian added a bit 
stiffly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about apologizing,&quot; Dan Dare looked amused, &quot;this is the 
most fun we&#39;ve seen in years.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Nearly a week later, and a much recovered Excalibur prepared to go. 
Their battered train had been repaired and reinforced, as well as 
outfitted with a few gifts of technology from their hosts. Sir Integral 
and Seres arrived to say goodbye, much as when they had greeted the 
team.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry the Queen couldn&#39;t be more help,&quot; Integral said gravely.

Alistaire shrugged slightly, &quot;They did their best.&quot; He smiled slightly, 
&quot;I think Dr. Mizuno wanted to take Widget apart at one point.&quot;

&quot;Eager scientists,&quot; Seres looked amused.

Integral gently drew Kitty aside. &quot;It&#39;s been good to meet you,&quot; she said 
seriously, &quot;and I wish you could stay longer.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Kitty blushed faintly as she pushed her hair back revealing a 
red mark on her neck, &quot;but Ray&#39;s rested up and I can&#39;t selfishly keep 
everyone here.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Integral nodded. &quot;Maybe someday we&#39;ll meet again.&quot;

&quot;Considering you&#39;re a cartoon character where I come from,&quot; Kitty 
sighed, &quot;it&#39;s not likely.&quot; Seeing a odd smile flit across Integral&#39;s 
face she asked, &quot;What...?&quot;

&quot;In the old days, we kept the Royal Order of Knights a secret by hiding 
in plain sight,&quot; Integral informed her, &quot;including releasing records of 
our exploits as fiction.&quot; She winked, &quot;It could be I exist on your world 
after all.&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Kitty kissed her gently then drew back, &quot;good bye.&quot;

&quot;Until we meet again,&quot; Integral stepped back, watching until they 
boarded the train and disappeared in a flare of light.

End

Notes: Integral and SEres are obviously from Hellsing. Dan Dare and Halo 
Jones are both from various British comics and Sam Vimes is visiting 
from the Discworld. lol</pre>
