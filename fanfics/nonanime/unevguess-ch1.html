********************************

You know, some things just naturally go together. I mean honestly, some 
things were just made to be together. Peanut butter and jelly for 
instance. A perfect combination that anyone in the world can identify 
as, well, a perfect combination. Meat and cheese are another good one. 
Bread and butter are a good example too. But it&#39;s not just food. Other 
things go together well. If you were do to the word association game 
where you gave a million different people around the world different 
words and asked what they first thought of, you&#39;d get a lot of similar 
answers if the word was say &#39;thunder&#39;. Obviously lightening. The point 
is, some things just naturally go together. The most obvious go together 
in my life is Daphne and Freddy. It&#39;s always been Daphne and Freddy. 
Even since we were little. Those two always pair up together when we go 
off to search for clues. They almost always sit next to each other. And 
the press has all but decided they&#39;ve secretly married. The rest of us 
might as well not exist for all the attention we get. Who solved the 
case? Daphne and Freddy. Who funded the case? Daphne and Freddy. Who 
saved the world? Daphne and Freddy. Okay, so I&#39;ve never really heard 
that last one, but you get the picture. So there they are, the picture 
perfect, divinely interventioned, fate sanctioned couple of Daphne and 
Freddy only, they aren&#39;t actually a couple. Sure they flirt and I know 
she&#39;s kissed him a few times. Honestly, they might very well of done 
more. But, she&#39;s not in love with him. And he isn&#39;t in love with her. 
Well, he might be in love with her, but she isn&#39;t in love with him. 
Wanna know how I know? Cause she&#39;s in love with me.
	
I know it&#39;s surprising, but it&#39;s true. No one would ever think it. 
Pristine, perfect Daphne with me of all people? God, the scandal there 
would be if it ever got out. Which is why she flirts so much with him. 
But I don&#39;t mind, not really. Because at the end of the day, provided 
she isn&#39;t kidnapped or we&#39;re all stuck in a well or chasing god knows 
what, it&#39;s me she comes to. I think she&#39;s come over to my house or just 
plain spent the night every night since we were all ten. Granted, it was 
mostly friendship then, but at about 12, or 14, I guess she grew up 
cause she quite literally jumped me one night when we were out camping 
during a case. Scared the absolute living daylights out of me. It really 
did. Like everyone else in the whole world I&#39;d just assumed that she and 
Freddy went off together because they were in love or lust or whatever 
it is that 14 year olds feel. So, I questioned her about it and she just 
threw back her beautiful hair and laughed.
	
&quot; Me and Freddy? Don&#39;t be silly. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve so much as held 
hands.&quot;  I was still in shock and my brain was reeling. Okay, she isn&#39;t 
with Freddy. So that equals wanting me? So, being as coherent as I was, 
I asked her that too. She just giggled and stared down at me from her 
position of straddling my waist. &quot; I don&#39;t know what part he plays in 
it, but I do know about the wanting you part.&quot; And with that she leaned 
down and gave me my very first kiss. I&#39;m not really not all that 
educated when it comes to things like that, but I was smart enough to 
know that a very beautiful woman was straddling my hips and giving me a 
very, very good, very arousing kiss. So, I did what seemed to be the 
natural thing to do, wrapped my arms around her, and kissed right back. 
It didn&#39;t go much further that night. But she proceeded to come and 
visit me nearly every night following. Of course I was thrilled. I mean, 
a completely gorgeous woman wanted me over Freddy! How could I not have 
been? Then, near the end of high school, she decided that she had to 
investigate all the rumors about her and Freddy and informed me that 
they were going on their very first official date. I was a little hurt. 
Granted, the two of us weren&#39;t dating. She wasn&#39;t about to bring me home 
to her parents and like I said before the scandal of Daphne and Freddy 
not existing in favor of Daphne and me might very well have put 
Mysteries Inc out of business. But still, I was bummed and went to bed 
early that night not wanting to think about his arms around her and not 
mine. I don&#39;t have anything against him, not really. Yeah, he takes 
credit for solving the cases and yeah he always sends me off, normally 
with the other two, into very dangerous situations so he can go off with 
MY woman. But still, he was an okay guy and he didn&#39;t know she was mine. 
She&#39;d never told him and I certainly hadn&#39;t said anything. Nobody knew 
that the two of us existed as an &#39;us&#39; but us.
	
So anyway I went to bed early only to be awakened at 11:00 or so by none 
other than Daphne at my window. Yes, designer everything, perfect hair 
and nails Daphne had climbed through the bushes and was waiting at my 
window. I let her in and she just grinned. Her date was to have started 
at 9:00 which meant it had lasted for a grand total of 2 hours with 
dinner included. You didn&#39;t have to be a genius to figure out that not 
only had not much happened, but it wasn&#39;t going to. But still, I asked 
her how it went and she just smiled that smile that she only smiles at 
me and said.
	
&quot; He&#39;s just not my type.&quot; Wrapped her arms around me, and proceeded to 
do very, very wonderful things. The subject of Freddy was promptly 
dropped. The next day though, as we all met to go over new case files he 
glared at me. Through the entire meeting he glared at me. After, I 
pulled my redheaded goddess aside and asked her why he was so mad. 
	
&quot; Cause last night when he wanted to go to his house because his parents 
were away, I told him that I couldn&#39;t cause I wanted to go be with you. 
He threw a little fit and said he could treat me better and please me 
better than you could and I told him that you treated me just fine and 
pleased me more than he ever could.&quot; And then she smiled and walked 
away. I floated on air for days afterward and suddenly it didn&#39;t matter 
that Freddy didn&#39;t like me, or that the entire world considered me a 
loser, cause she wanted me. That was when I realized that I loved her. 
Not just as a friend, and not just for the sex either. I was honestly in 
love with her. And that didn&#39;t bother me a bit. A few years later, 
during a particularly intense night, I spoke those very words in the 
heat of the moment and froze. Afraid that I&#39;d just ruined everything by 
confessing love instead of staying quiet like a good little sex-toy I 
pulled away. She asked what was wrong and I gaped at her asking how she 
could ask that after I&#39;d just told her I loved her and ruined 
everything. She asked me why everything was ruined and I said it was 
because I loved her. Her response was to cock her head at me and raise 
an eyebrow. Giggling she sat down beside me, took my hand and smiled.
	
&quot; Why is that so bad? I love you to you know.&quot; My oh so intelligent 
response was to drop my jaw and stare until she decided that she didn&#39;t 
like words so much and wanted to show me exactly how much she loved me. 
I woke up from my daze pretty quick after that and showed her exactly 
how much I loved her. From how long she slept afterward, I think I won. 
	
So, that&#39;s the big secret. She and I are in love. We are complete 
opposites, like say pickles and ice cream. But pregnant women have often 
craved that exact combination so maybe you just need to have a unique 
perspective to see how we go together. In any case, here we are, ten 
years from our first kiss, and we&#39;re still just as close. Like I said, 
some things are just meant for each other. So now when she walks into my 
room at night and gives me that same soft smile, just like she used to. 
I just put my arms around her, whisper &quot; I love you Daphne&quot;, and kiss 
her as best as I can. I guess I kiss pretty good cause afterwards, she 
always smiles and whispers &quot; I love you too Velma.&quot;
