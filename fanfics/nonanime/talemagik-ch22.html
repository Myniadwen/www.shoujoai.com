<h1>Kitty and Illyana: A Tale of Magik! (part 22 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Something very like a sun beat down on the deserts of
the Dark Dimension, the military encampment set up in
the shadow of great cliffs. Humans, humanoids and
various other beings were gathering there, more and
more every day, rebels dedicated in overthrowing the
demonic ruler of this realm and returning their true
princess to power.

Dr. Stephen Strange smiled slightly, his black beard
streaked with gray, his dark hair having reached his
shoulders. The heavy oaken staff he leaned on had
become almost a familiar to him, the robes he now wore
replacing his old costume. Elaborate spells protected
this place and the people here, enchantments he had
woven with great care to protect them from this
place&#39;s demonic lord.

&quot;It&#39;s coming together, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Clea murmured, her
white hair falling into her gentle eyes. Her purple
body suit clung to her slim form, a figure that
Stephen had come to know very well.

&quot;We&#39;re going to win,&quot; Stephen answered, looking at her
with love in her eyes. She gazed at the crystal sphere
and frowned, just slightly.

&quot;You&#39;re worried you couldn&#39;t reach your students?&quot;
Clea asked wryly.

Stephen shrugged a bit sheepishly, &quot;It is unusual.&quot;

Clea sighed, &quot;They are both very capable young women,
Stephen.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;And if you&#39;re really
intending to stay here with me after the war is over,
you&#39;ll need to accept that they can handle the job you
left them.&quot;

Stephen hugged her gently, breathing in her lovely
scent. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; he smiled, &quot;it&#39;s probably
nothing too serious.&quot;

Meanwhile, across the dimensions, a conversation was
going on about how to handle possibly one of the most
dangerous forces in the universe. &quot;So we&#39;re going to
build a shield,&quot; Kitty Pryde said, her brown hair tied
back to keep it out of her eyes as she gestured, &quot;a
web to contain any backlash from the Anti-Phoenix.&quot;

Illyanna Rasuptin nodded agreement, the lovely blonde
sitting there by her lover on one of the stones
outside the Weird Happenings Organization&#39;s tent. &quot;I&#39;m
sorry I doubted you,&quot; she admitted softly, gently
taking Kitty&#39;s hand.

&quot;Don&#39;t be,&quot; Kitty flashed her a smile, &quot;that&#39;s what a
partner is for, to make us look at a problem from all
sides.&quot;

Illyanna looked a bit sheepish as she admitted, &quot;I
just wish that Alysande hadn&#39;t been the one to finally
solve the problem.&quot;

&quot;Made me feel dumb, yeah,&quot; Kitty agreed. She smiled
slightly, &quot;Did you notice how Jean seems to like
talking to her?&quot;

Illyanna looked at her oddly, &quot;You may be reading too
much into it.&quot;

Alysande smiled wryly as the brown haired older woman
stepped out of the tent, quietly moving away from
where she had been listening to the young women talk.
&#39;I rather wish I hadn&#39;t overheard that,&#39; she thought
as she casually walked over to the circle of standing
stones, &#39;those women are far too perceptive for my
tastes.&#39;

The wind was chilly, moisture in the air making
Alysande wonder if there wasn&#39;t another storm coming.
Her uniform kept out the cold, thankfully, and her
boots were good enough to handle the rough terrain as
she cut across the stony ground.

A figure stood near the edge of the churning energy
fields, her long red hair flowing back from her face.
She had an almost unearthly beauty as she turned to
look at Alysande. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect to see you out
here,&quot; Jean commented.

&#39;What are the odds, I wonder?&#39; Alsyande thought to
herself with amusement. She shrugged slightly as she
smiled at Jean, &quot;I may love my brother dearly but
there&#39;s only so long I can take being the sounding
board on his cross-temporal theories.&quot;

Jean flashed a smile, &quot;He&#39;s trying to determine how
Rachel and I could still be here if we&#39;ve altered the
timeline that produced our future?&quot;

&quot;Up to a point it&#39;s interesting to listen to,&quot;
Alysande commented warmly, &quot;but after a bit it gets a
it much. Kitty and Illyanna went outside to talk,
Rachel grabbed a quick snack and with you gone that
just left me.&quot;

Jean looked amused, &quot;So sorry.&quot;

&quot;Your sympathy overwhelms me,&quot; Alysande said dryly.

&quot;Have Kitty and Illyanna decided on a strategy yet?&quot;
Jean asked.

&quot;In broad terms, I think,&quot; Alysande answered her as
she gazed thoughtfully at the ominous circle of
stones, &quot;something about building a kind of barrier.&quot;

Jean nodded thoughtfully, &quot;A layered shield, probably,
and we&#39;ll likely need the assistance of other
magicians, too.&quot;

&quot;Why other...?&quot; Alysande blinked.

Jean turned to look as lightning arched over the
stones, flickering in the cloudy day. &quot;I won&#39;t be able
to help,&quot; she explained grimly, &quot;the Anti-Phoenix was
created to target me. If I contributed my power to the
barrier our foe might be able to break through much
easier.&quot;

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Alysande admitted. She looked over at
Jean, &quot;I have to admit, I was a bit surprised that you
chose to tell my brother and I that you were the
embodiment of the Phoenix.&quot;

Jean shrugged slightly, &quot;We may need your help in
this.&quot; She paused a moment, &quot;I am a creature of
impulse and instinct, and those are telling me to
trust you.&quot;

Alysande looked over at Jean in surprise, then smiled.
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she softly answered.

Before they could say anything else there was the
crunch of gravel and soft conversation as two figures
drew near. Allistaire was talking softly, brown hair
falling slightly messily into his face while Rachel
looked gently amused by his antics. The redheaded
young lady waved as they approached, &quot;The sorcerers
say they&#39;re ready to go.&quot;

Allistaire was rubbing his hands together eagerly,
&quot;I&#39;ll have all our recording equipment on as they
work, the data we&#39;ll acquire could be invaluable.&quot;

&quot;Have you asked them first?&quot; Alysande asked as they
walked back over to the tent.

&quot;I hadn&#39;t really thought about that,&quot; Allistaire
blinked. He looked a bit sheepish as he asked them, &quot;I
guess I should?&quot;

&quot;Probably a good idea,&quot; Rachel laughed. She looked
impish, &quot;I don&#39;t know what would happen if you annoyed
Kitty, but I wouldn&#39;t want to find out.&quot;

With a wicked smile Jean played along, &quot;We don&#39;t know
what happened to the last guy who did something like
that.&quot;

Alysande smiled as she watched her brother looking
very nervous. She strongly suspected that Rachel and
Jean were pulling his leg, but she wasn&#39;t going to say
anything. &#39;Besides,&#39; she thought semi-seriously, &#39;I&#39;d
be more worried about Illyanna.&#39;

Kitty looked up as the group entered the tent, her
eyebrow rising as she saw the anxious look on
Allistaire&#39;s face. &quot;What&#39;s with him?&quot; she asked.

Rachel grinned at her teacher, &quot;Just nerves,
probably.&quot;

Illyanna gave Rachel a suspicious look but decided not
to ask. &quot;Kitty and I have a strategy,&quot; she answered,
&quot;she&#39;ll summarize it.&quot;

Kitty wiped at her eyes tiredly. &quot;We&#39;re setting up a
defensive grid,&quot; she said, &quot;calling on several
magicians to build a intricate defense both for us and
Phoenix.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Jean looked startled.

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Alysande murmured after a moment, &quot;if
this thing was built to go after Phoenix it may strike
if we tamper with it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s frustrating that I can&#39;t help,&quot; Jean scowled.

&quot;If we fail you have to be here to pick up the
pieces,&quot; Illyanna said seriously.

&quot;We&#39;ve contacted the mystics we&#39;ll need via astral
projection,&quot; Kitty said, the strain of that clearly
explaining why she looked so tired.

&quot;A bit of a mixed bag,&quot; Illyanna added, &quot;Agatha
Harkness and the Scarlet Witch, Jennifer Kale, Brother
Voodoo, Shaman, Doctor Druid and Albion are all ready
to pitch in.&quot;

&quot;We would have called in Victor Von Doom,&quot; Kitty
added, &quot;but he&#39;d be way too likely to screw with us
and try to gain the Anti-Phoenix himself.&quot;

&quot;So when do we go?&quot; Rachel asked eagerly.

&quot;Tomorrow morning,&quot; Illyanna said, ignoring the frown
that Kitty gave her. She sighed, &quot;We all need to be at
our best when we do this.&quot;

&quot;We have extra tents we can set up for you,&quot; Alysande
quickly volunteered.

Jean chuckled, &quot;Good, otherwise Kitty or Illyanna
would have had to magic something up.&quot;

&quot;I almost wish I could see that,&quot; Allistaire murmured.

To be continued...
