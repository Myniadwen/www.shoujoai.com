<h1>Double Life (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jsyxx.html">J-Syxx</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/doublelife-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The three spies walked down a back-street together in their colored 
uniforms. Their destination was the circular, towering building that 
acted as Elektro Records&#39; head-quarters.

&quot;Let&#39;s hurry and wrap up this mission. I gotta date tonight with that 
hunky, hottie Chad. If I don&#39;t show, that bitch, Mandy, will probably 
try to whore her way to him.&quot;

&quot;Clover, if you don&#39;t shut up, I swear I&#39;m going to slap you!&quot; Sam said 
obviously agitated.

Clover looked shocked. Sam was never that sharp with her, &quot;Sorry, Sam. 
Did I say something wrong? Do you like Chad?&quot;

&quot;NO!!&quot;

Alex and Clover both looked at her. She looked like she was fighting 
hard to hold back tears.

Clover put her hand on her shoulder and gave her a concerned look, &quot;Is 
there something wrong Sammy?&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Clover. I didn&#39;t mean to yell at you like that. There isn&#39;t 
anything wrong with me. I&#39;m ok.&quot; Her voice didn&#39;t exactly exude 
confidence.

&quot;If there&#39;s something wrong Sam you can tell us. We&#39;re you&#39;re best 
friends,&quot; Alex told her compassionately. &quot;You can trust us.&quot;

&quot;No, really, there&#39;s nothing wrong. I don&#39;t know what came over me. I&#39;m 
just fine. I swear.&quot; She said that but to Clover and Alex she looked 
pathetic. In fact, she had been acting depressed ever since she got home 
from school.

Mean while, up on the Elektro Tower rooftop stood four individuals. One 
was the ex-guitar player, ex-eccentric record producer, turned criminal 
mad-man, Sebastian. As usual he wore his long silver hair over one of 
his eyes, and in place of one of his hands he lost in a pyrotechnics 
accident was a metal claw. Next to him stood a man in his early forties. 
He had out of style, female-length, brunette hair and wore a black, 
cutoff t-shirt. Strapped to his chest was a blue, angular Floyd Rose 
electric guitar. A third short-haired, dark-skinned, thirty-something 
man was holding another man in a business suit by his collar dangerously 
close to the edge of the building

&quot;Jerrell, I&#39;m sorry. Honest. How about we cut a deal? I&#39;ve got tens of 
millions,&quot; pleaded the terrified record exec.

&quot;Bob, you should&#39;ve thought about giving me your money, excuse me, MY 
MONEY, ten years ago when you left me with nothing!&quot;

&quot;How about twenty mil? Does that sound good?&quot; He was sweating beads.

&quot;I don&#39;t want your filthy money anymore, BOB. I&#39;ve moved on to bigger 
things.&quot; He pointed his thumb back at Sebastian and the man with the 
guitar.

&quot;Get on with it. We&#39;re on a schedule.&quot; Sebastian told him.

&quot;Ok, you dropped me from Elektro. Now, I&#39;m going to drop you!&quot;

Jerrell pushed him over the edge.

&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot;

&quot;And he said I couldn&#39;t cross-over! HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa!&quot;

Clover spotted the man falling, &quot;I got this one!&quot; She flew up with her 
jetpack-backpack and saved him from certain doom about fifty feet from 
the ground. Clover hovered back down to the street and let him down.

&quot;Oh, thank you!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re spies from WOOHP,&quot; Alex said. &quot;What happened up there?&quot;

&quot;Some rapper I signed a million years ago is trying to kill me!&quot;

&quot;Was there anyone else with him?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;An ancient looking Rock guy with a guitar and some scary guy with a 
metal hand. I think he was a producer from years ago.&quot;

&quot;Say, I&#39;ve been looking to start my career as a pop-idol. How about 
since I saved your life, you sign me!&quot; Clover said getting all giddy.

The record exec looked her over for a moment. &quot;Actually, you look just 
like the kind of artist I&#39;ve been searching for. Can you sing?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Sam and Alex both responded simultaneously.

&quot;Well that&#39;s not a problem. Here.&quot; He handed Clover his business card.

&quot;Yay!&quot; Clover jump up and down. &quot;I&#39;m going to be a star!&quot;

&quot;Earth to Clover. We have a job to do!&quot; Sam yelled sounding whiney and 
pissed off again.

&quot;PMS much?&quot; Clover mumbled to herself.

&quot;What did you say?&quot;

&quot;Um, nothing. I guess my fame and fortune can wait. Let&#39;s go.&quot; They all 
turned on their jetpack backpacks and flew the four hundred feet to the 
top of the tower.

They landed, just as the three men were boarding their helicopter.

Sebastian stepped down from the chopper. &quot;Well, well, well. I thought 
you three would turn up sooner or later. Surprised to see me?&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding? We already knew it was you,&quot; said Sam. &quot;I figured that 
out a long time ago.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, helloooo! Sebastian. Music CDs that brain-wash people. We get it. 
You don&#39;t think we wouldn&#39;t figure it out after the first hundred times 
you tried that one?&quot; Clover went on, &quot;Just because they weren&#39;t glowing 
this time, doesn&#39;t mean we wouldn&#39;t figure it out. We&#39;re not stupid.&quot;

Alex added, &quot;Maybe you should try making movies that brain wash people. 
Or you could do books or magazines. Or maybe you could try brainwashing 
dogs and cats instead of people...&quot;

&quot;May I talk now!&quot; Sebastian asked in an angry, annoyed tone.

&quot;Yes, you may.&quot; Alex answered.

&quot;Boys, why don&#39;t you help me exterminate these pests?&quot;

&quot;Sure thing, Sebastian,&quot; replied Steve the rocker. Both men stepped 
forward.

Jerrell reached into the back pocket of his baggy pants and extracted a 
microphone. He put it in front of his lips. &quot;A mic check one two, one 
two.&quot; He then flipped it forward and pressed a button on it with his 
thumb. Green rings of energy shot out through its chrome head. He moved 
it from side to side, spraying the rings and the three spies. Each of 
them gracefully avoided the rings by flipping their bodies in the air 
and landing back on the ground. He sprayed the energy blasts until it 
suddenly stopped. The rings traveled over to the adjacent building where 
it crashed into some office windows shattering them with a loud crash.

&quot;Hey sweet thing, how about you and me, one on one? I&#39;ll promise to be 
gentle.&quot; Steve said staring a hole in Sam.

&quot;How about you SHUT UP!&quot; Sam jumped and floated through the air with her 
right leg extended in the direction of Steve&#39;s chest. Steve mean while 
took the pick in his thumb and strummed the strings of his guitar. The 
sound of the guitar could be heard as a wave of white, condensed, sonic 
energy burst out from the guitar. It hit Sam, and she was knocked to the 
side landing on her hands and knees.

Mean while, Clover was sizing up Jerrell.

&quot;Nice thing you got there.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you. I am quite proud of it.&quot;

He pointed the mic at her and fired it shooting the bright, green rings 
in her direction. Clover swiftly sailed out of the way landing on her 
hands, flipped back to her feet again, then back to her hands, and back 
to her feet, expertly avoiding the energy blasts. Finally, the shot ran 
out and Clover ran forward with her fist arched.

&quot;Back up.&quot; He pulled out a large, hunting knife with his left hand and 
swiped it at Clover&#39;s neck. Clover was able to react fast enough to pull 
back so the blade was inches from her neck, saving her from death. At 
the same time, she swept with her right foot and tripped him. He landed 
on his butt, but that didn&#39;t stop him from simply aiming the mic at 
Clover and firing again. Clover ducked and rolled her self out of the 
way.

Alex approached Sebastian. &quot;Looks like we&#39;re dancing partners. Where&#39;s 
your fancy weapon?&quot;

&quot;Since my last stay at your prison, I&#39;ve been studying the martial arts. 
I am a weapon.&quot;

&quot;Ok, let&#39;s see what you got.&quot; Alex put her hands up in her fighting 
stance.

Sebastian swung his foot forward. He wasn&#39;t joking. That kick was 
expertly delivered and lighting fast. Alex was able to twist out of the 
way of as his boot which just missed her. She swung her hand towards his 
neck in a chopping motion. Sebastian blocked it with his metal claw.

&quot;Ouch!&quot; Alex cried and held her hand after it contacted the hard steel.

Sebastian then lunged another kick forward towards her chest, but Alex 
put up her fore-arm and blocked it. He then swung his metal claw around 
in a circular motion towards her head. She reacted by ducking out of the 
way of the claw, planting her hands on the ground and sweeping with both 
her feet in an attempt to trip him. He jumped over both of her legs. 
Alex than with both hands still on the ground, pushed herself up with 
both her legs aimed at Sebastian in a double kick. Sebastian moved to 
the left and caught her in mid flight, then slammed her body forward one 
hundred and eighty degrees so that she landed face first into the 
concrete.

&quot;Ok, you&#39;re not too bad for a beginner,&quot; Alex said from the ground as 
some blood flowed down her lower lip.

Clover was having quite a time dodging the energy rings from the suped 
up microphone. So far her fine tuned agility was doing her well, but all 
this jumping around was quickly making her haggard. Finally, his latest 
string of energy blasts temporarily ran out. Clover took this 
opportunity to remove the kitty-cat shaped Boomerang Buzzsaw Barrette 
from her hair. She took it and flicked it hard in the direction of 
Jerrell. The blade extracted, and it cut through the air spinning. It 
made contact with his microphone, and its chrome head fell to the floor. 
The barrette flew back in the other direction planting itself and into 
the wall some distance behind Clover.

&quot;Awwww, looks like you lost your manhood.&quot; Clover said breathing deeply 
with her hands on her knees.

&quot;I always carry a spare.&quot; He whipped out another microphone from his 
back pocket and blasted the rings at Clover. She was caught off guard 
and took the shot full on. She was pushed back until she slammed against 
the wall. She slumped over unconscious.

&quot;And my battle record is still spotless.&quot;

&quot;Clover!&quot; Sam yelled seeing what happened to her friend.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about your friend, baby. You should be worrying about me.&quot; 
What he said was true, Sam had been taking a good beating from his 
guitar weapon. &quot;You know my favorite groupies were always the red-heads. 
I can&#39;t wait to add you to my list.&quot;

&quot;I told you to SHUT UP!&quot; Sam charged at him in a rage with her fist 
arched. He ran his pick across the strings again and a blast of white 
energy shot out from the guitar. She managed to cart-wheel out of the 
way.

&quot;Didn&#39;t your mother tell you that&#39;s a rude thing to say. Looks like I&#39;m 
going to have to give you a spanking.&quot; He started running the pick back 
and forth again, and a long, stream of the energy started blasting out 
as he played a chord. Sam tried to jump out the way, but she tripped 
clumsily. Before she hit the ground, the energy smacked her and she flew 
in the air, landing and passing out next to Clover.

&quot;Sam!&quot; Alex yelled looking at what happened to her.

Sebastian took advantage of her moment of distraction and jabbed his 
metal claw into her stomach hard.

&quot;Ughhh!&quot; Alex fell over in a fetal position with her hands clutched 
around her stomach in immense, sharp pain.

&quot;Enough games.&quot; Sebastian said to his troops. &quot;Steve lets blow this 
place.&quot;

&quot;Music to my ears.&quot;

They all boarded the helicopter. Jerrell took the pilot&#39;s seat, and the 
blades started spinning.

Alex saw them leaving from her position on the ground. &quot;Why didn&#39;t they 
finish us off?&quot; She knew something wasn&#39;t right.

The helicopter hovered a few hundred feet higher in the air. Steve took 
off his blue Floyd Rose and strapped on a rounder, black, Rickenbacker 
bass. He stood in front of the open window.

&quot;Elektro Records, are you ready to ROCK?!!&quot;

He started running his pick across the strings in another chord, and a 
darker thicker energy shot out from the guitar. The energy sped down at 
an angle and collided against the top of the Elektro Tower in a 
thunderous crash. Steve kept on playing, and the ground shook as the 
blasts decimated the building sending rubble everywhere. Soon the entire 
structure simply collapsed into ground into a huge pile of wreckage. Tan 
dust flooded the air in the streets below. Steve stopped playing, and 
the helicopter lifted higher and off into the direction of the setting 
sun.

Alex landed on the ground carrying Clover and Sam in her arms. She shook 
both of them until they finally slipped back into consciousness.

&quot;Wh..what happened?&quot; Sam asked dazed.

Alex pointed at the wreckage, &quot;Well, let&#39;s just say I don&#39;t think 
Clover&#39;s getting a record contract from there anytime soon.&quot;

Clover started crying. &quot;My music career!&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

They were now back in Jerry&#39;s office sitting on his couch.

&quot;Spies what happened?&quot;

Alex answered him, &quot;Well, Jerry, the short story is we got our butts 
kicked.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, they had these really cool weapons,&quot; Clover said.

&quot;Yes, we observed the microphone and guitar weapons from surveillance 
footage. It is my belief these are based on WOOHP technology of gadgets 
and weapons we have and have been working on. Sebastian must&#39;ve acquired 
them before he escaped. To say the least, I&#39;m looking into improving 
security in the weapons cache and R&amp;D department.&quot;

&quot;And you may want to improve the security in the prison too, you know so 
he stops escaping,&quot; Sam said in a sharp voice.

Jerry scrunched his lip up, &quot;Hmmmmm.&quot; He didn&#39;t expect that kind of 
attitude from Sam. &quot;Point taken.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve also IDed the two men working with Sebastian.&quot; The screen behind 
him turned on showing the profiles of the two men and their various 
statistics.

&quot;The one with the guitar weapons is Steven Coscarelli, the former lead 
guitarist of the rock and roll band....&quot;

&quot;Rock and roll band?&quot; Clover and Alex snickered. &quot;Owwww!&quot; Alex gripped 
her bandaged stomach. Laughing was painful.

&quot;Yes, well his band was named The Blind Gun Theory.&quot; Jerry raised his 
eye-brow. &quot;The man with the microphone weapon is one Jerrell Williams. 
He was once a rapper known as MC Fax in a hip hop group named 
Underground Science. Both men had worked with Sebastian at some point in 
their careers.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of either of those groups,&quot; Clover said. &quot;They must 
not be very good.&quot;

&quot;Well, you might not have because both men were dropped from their 
labels in 1995 when management deemed their music to no longer be 
marketable. Both subsequently met financial ruin and slipped into 
obscurity until now.&quot;

&quot;Great, more washed up has-beens who are mad they aren&#39;t popular 
anymore.&quot;

&quot;Misery loves company,&quot; Sam said drably.

&quot;Perhaps. Both of their former record label head-quarters were destroyed 
tonight. To say the least, I am disappointed in you girls. It&#39;s obvious 
to me not all of you had your heads in the mission tonight. I suggest 
you go home rest, and clear your mind of any personal problems you might 
be dealing with. Who knows what atrocity Sebastian will try to commit 
next.&quot;

Sam stared at the ground. She knew Jerry was talking to her. Her 
performance tonight had been horrible. She was acting like a complete 
amateur. Was she really this upset over what had happened with Mandy? 
She wish she could sleep off this sadness that had over-taken her, but 
she knew deep down that wouldn&#39;t be enough.
