<h1>Excalibur: Crystal London (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This is also a crossover with my alternate history &quot;Eternal City Crystal 
Tokyo&quot; though reading that series is not required.


It all began with the discovery of the Widget entity, a small, silver 
metal robot that was mysteriously alive. Possessed of the power to 
travel across parallel worlds Widget accidentally took Excalibur along 
with him, sparking a mad road trip across worlds who&#39;s history diverged 
from our own at certain critical points.

Fa-ZAM!

In a massive explosion of light and color the train appeared in the air, 
falling to the ground with a loud thump with steam pouring off the red, 
white and blue painted surface. There was a hiss of cooling metal and a 
soft rumble as the battered vessel settled, then from within voices 
could soon be heard.

&quot;Is everyone all right?&quot; Captain Britain demanded, forcing open the 
slightly dented door to let some fresh air in.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Meggan shook out her long blonde mane of hair, her simple 
orange one piece costume clinging to every curve.

&quot;Grrr,&quot; Lockheed the dragon shook himself, the small grey skinned 
beastie looking decidedly annoyed as he picked himself up off the floor.

&quot;Could someone find my glasses?&quot; the black haired older man asked 
groggily, shaking his head as he sat in a banged up seat.

&quot;You aren&#39;t wearing glasses, Alistaire&quot; the blue furred mutant called 
Nightcrawler noted, having kept his balance through all the chaos.

&quot;Ah, that explains it,&quot; Alistaire shook his head dazedly.

&quot;Augh,&quot; Rachel Summers gave a incoherent moan, staggering away from 
where Widget say peacefully on Kitty&#39;s improvised work-bench.

&quot;Ray,&quot; Kitty Pryde quickly hurried over, barely avoiding the spikes on 
the redhead&#39;s hound costume as she grabbed her and held her up. &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong?&quot; the brown haired young woman in blue demanded.

&quot;Just tired,&quot; Rachel smiled up at her weakly, &quot;powering up Widget for 
the jumps takes a lot out of me.&quot;

&quot;You hear that?&quot; Kurt asked, a slight smile teasing his lips.

&quot;Sirens and alarms,&quot; Kitty noted.

&quot;Typical X-Men moment,&quot; Rachel murmured to her, &quot;you can tell where 
we&#39;ve been &#145;cause it&#39;s on fire.&quot;

Kitty snorted her amusement.

&quot;Ladies and gents,&quot; Captain Britain&#39;s voice came from outside as he 
said, &quot;you&#39;d better come look at this.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Kurt bamfed out, teleporting above even as the others made 
their way out the door to take in the latest world they had arrived in.

&quot;Hrr?&quot; Lockheed made a odd noise as he soared out a broken window.

&quot;Well, this is odd,&quot; Rachel conceded after she and Kitty made it outside 
and took a moment of taking in the view.

&quot;Do you realize where we are?&quot; Kitty squeaked out in excitement as she 
gazed out at what awaited them.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Captain Britain took off his helmet, the blonde haired Brian 
Braddock looking over at her curiously.

&quot;It&#39;s Crystal Tokyo!&quot;

Stretching off into the distance was a city that almost defied all 
description. It looked like a mad puzzle, with buildings from many eras 
and places combined in a sprawling super-city, the core of which was a 
beautiful set of crystaline towers, a river flowing crystal pure nearby.

&quot;More probably,&quot; Alistaire noted as he also took in their surroundings, 
&quot;it&#39;s some variation on Crystal London.&quot;

&quot;And you know this because?&quot; Meggan asked Kitty curiously.

&quot;I&#39;m a anime fan,&quot; Kitty said just a bit sheepishly, &quot;and if fits most 
of the descriptions that I&#39;ve read.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; Rachel noted wryly.

&quot;Incoming,&quot; Kurt warned as he pointed out to the wary crowd that had 
gathered a safe distance from the train.

A band of men and women broke out of the mob and started towards where 
the train sat, two unusual women in the lead. The taller one had long, 
almost pure white hair, her manner looking oddly formal as she chewed on 
a unlit cigar while beside her a blonde haired girl followed, hefting a 
very big gun over her shoulder with surprising ease.

&quot;Who&#39;s in charge here?&quot; the white haired woman asked them, authority 
radiating from her every pore.

&quot;Should I...?&quot; Brian asked the others.

&quot;Go for it,&quot; Kitty nodded to him encouragingly before adding much more 
softly, &quot;but watch your neck.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Brian blinked.

&quot;If they&#39;re who I think they are,&quot; Kitty whispered, &quot;they&#39;re vampires.&quot;

Captain Britain stepped forward, his large muscular form radiating 
confidence as he addressed the two women, &quot;My name is Captain Britain, 
and these are my comrades in Excalibur. My apologies for our unusual 
arrival.&quot;

&quot;My name is Integral Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing,&quot; the white haired 
woman nodded, &quot;welcome to London.&quot;

&quot;I knew it,&quot; Kitty whispered excitedly to Rachel.

&quot;And this is Seras Victoria,&quot; Integral gestured to the tough blonde, &quot;my 
lover.&quot;

Kitty made a odd noise in the back of her throat and Meggan looked at 
her innocently. &quot;Not in the anime?&quot; she asked curiously.

&quot;You could say that,&quot; Kitty managed.

&quot;Grrrr,&quot; Lockheed grumbled, looking at the two vampires warily.

&quot;Can we be of assistance?&quot; Integral asked crisply.

&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you have the means to transport beings across 
dimensions?&quot; Alistaire asked hopefully.

&quot;You&#39;re joking, right?&quot; Seras asked wryly.

&quot;Didn&#39;t think so,&quot; Alistaire sighed.

&quot;If you wish,&quot; Intergal offered, &quot;a request could be put to the Queen&#39;s 
court for assistance in your situation.&quot;

&quot;The Queen of England?&quot; Brian asked curiously.

&quot;No,&quot; Integral smiled slightly, &quot;Serenity, Queen of Earth.&quot; Seeing the 
slightly overwhelmed looks of the newcomers she continued, &quot;I&#39;d like to 
officially offer you the hospitality of our city as well. If you need 
anything, just ask.&quot;

Seras smiled with a twinkle of fangs as she added, &quot;They&#39;ll also be a 
reception tonight at the new tower of London, if you&#39;re interested.&quot; 
With that Integral and Seras headed off, meeting with their companions 
then the group heading back towards the city.

Quickly deciding it would be good to confer the team returned to the 
inside of the train, sadly disappointing the many gawkers lingering 
outside. &quot;Well,&quot; Brian looked at his friends, &quot;what do you think?&quot;

&quot;We should certainly investigate the city,&quot; Alistaire said firmly.

&quot;Rachel, did you get anything telepathically?&quot; Kurt asked, standing 
comfortably against one of the walls.

&quot;They seem to be on the up and up,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;both the ladies 
and anyone I could scan in the crowd.&quot;

&quot;Kitty?&quot; Brian hid a smile.

&quot;I&#39;m too biased,&quot; Kitty admitted with a grin, &quot;I really want to see who 
we might run into in that version of London.&quot; She looked over, &quot;How 
about you, Meggan?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m curious too,&quot; Meggan admitted as the blonde women smiled gently, 
&quot;and I&#39;d love to see some new people.&quot;

&quot;I think we all agree,&quot; Kurt said as he looked his friends over, &quot;we&#39;ll 
visit the city and the reception tonight.&quot; Seriously he added, &quot;But be 
careful, everyone. Just because everything looks on the up and up 
doesn&#39;t mean it really is.&quot;

&quot;Whuff,&quot; Lockheed agreed.</pre>
