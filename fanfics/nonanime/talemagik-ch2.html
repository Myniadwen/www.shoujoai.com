<h1>Kitty and Illyana: A Tale of Magik! (part 2 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>        HOW, EXACTLY, DID I GET HERE? the black robbed skeleton asked, 
his words seeming to materialize in the thoughts of all those around 
him. A kitten sat in his lap, batting playfully at the skeletal 
fingers that were being waved at it.

        &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to know,&quot; the pale skinned girl noted, 
also dressed all in black. An ankh necklace dangled around her neck as 
she leaned over to pick up her cup of tea.

        SQUEEK! the robe shrouded rat&#39;s skeleton added, dog-paddling 
in it&#39;s own cup.

        Kitty and Illyanna exchanged a glance, then both of them 
raised their hands.

        Dr. Strange sighed softly, sipping some tea. &quot;Only three 
months training, and they&#39;re calling up Deaths,&quot; the dark haired man 
muttered as he shook his head. With a little smile he added, &quot;Remind 
me to lock up the more advanced books.&quot;

        &quot;Uhm,&quot; Kitty smiled, &quot;More tea?&quot;

        &quot;Please,&quot; the female Death held out her cup to the brown 
haired girl.

        DO YOU HAVE THOSE LITTLE SAUSAGE THINGS? the skeleton Death 
asked them eagerly, I LOVE THOSE.

        &quot;I&#39;ll take a look,&quot; Illyanna smiled.

        SQUEEK, SQUEEK SQUEEK! the Death of Rats piped up before the 
blonde could get out of the sitting room and into the kitchen.

        &quot;You could murder a cheese?&quot; Kitty chuckled softly. An odd 
look appeared on her face, &quot;How did I understand that?&quot;

        Dr. Strange frowned thoughtfully.

        &quot;They&#39;re both advancing that fast in their studies?&quot; Prof. 
Xavier asked him a few hours later. The bald headed telepath&#39;s astral 
form floated just above Dr. Strange&#39;s cluttered desk, while the dark 
haired magician was having a strong cup of tea.

        Dr. Strange nodded to his old friend glumly, &quot;You have no 
idea.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not just the difficulty of the spell, is it?&quot; Xavier 
asked.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t even attempt that spell,&quot; Dr. Strange waved his hand 
in the air, nearly spilling his cup of tea, &quot;until after more than a 
year of training. Didn&#39;t succeed until a month later. And I&#39;ve never 
accidentally summoned more than one Death!&quot; He puffed out a breath, 
&quot;The potential power of those two is greater than I thought.&quot;

        &quot;So what are you going to do?&quot; Xavier asked sympathetically.

        &quot;I&#39;ll lock up the more advanced books,&quot; Dr. Strange sighed 
softly, &quot;and try my best just to keep ahead of them.&quot;

        &quot;Is there anything I can do?&quot; Xavier offered.

        &quot;Wish me luck,&quot; Dr. Strange smiled wryly.

        Upstairs, Kitty and Illyanna were sitting on their beds and 
talking quietly. Dr. Strange&#39;s mansion had many rooms, but due to the 
unusual nature of most of them, it was decided that it was probably 
best that they share a room together.

        Kitty didn&#39;t really mind that, however. She was used to 
sharing a room with Illyanna back at the school anyway, and it was 
nice having someone around to talk with. &quot;You know,&quot; Kitty smiled, 
&quot;they were kind of nice.&quot;

        &quot;I thought so,&quot; Illyanna nodded. She gave Kitty an impish 
little smile, &quot;Did you notice how that female Death was checking you 
out?&quot;

        Kitty blushed furiously. Yes, she had noticed how the lady had 
been looking her over. It was just a wee bit unnerving. &quot;You know,&quot; 
Kitty said softly, &quot;about Piotr...&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Illyanna asked her sympathetically. She knew that her 
friend had been missing Illyanna&#39;s big brother, whom Kitty had a big 
crush on.

        &quot;I don&#39;t miss him,&quot; Kitty said softly, &quot;at least, not as much 
as I thought I would.&quot; A soft sigh, &quot;Maybe I&#39;m really not in love with 
him.&quot;

        Illyanna smiled at her slightly, &quot;It does happen, you know.&quot; 
Kitty looked over at her curiously and Illyanna elaborated, &quot;You&#39;re 
around someone all the time, you might develop an attraction to them 
simply because they&#39;re... available.&quot;

        &quot;You could be right,&quot; Kitty admitted as she rolled over on to 
her back.

        &quot;I&#39;m always right,&quot; Illyanna smirked.

        &quot;I wouldn&#39;t go that far,&quot; Kitty shot back. She looked up at 
the ceiling when a thought occured to her, &quot;Is there anyone that 
you&#39;re interested in?&quot;

        Illyanna hesitated a moment, &quot;Yes, there is.&quot;

        &quot;Really?&quot; Kitty sat back up to look at her, &quot;Who is it?&quot;

        &quot;Down, Pryde,&quot; Illyanna chuckled, &quot;it&#39;s a friend of mine.&quot; She 
smiled a bit sadly, &quot;I just haven&#39;t gotten around to telling them...&quot;

        &quot;Why not?&quot; Kitty asked her gently.

        &quot;Guess I don&#39;t want to risk the friendship,&quot; Illyanna said 
softly.

        Kitty was about to persue the that when they both felt it. It 
was an odd feeling, like a bell ringing in their bones, and she said, 
&quot;Looks like the teach is calling.&quot;

        Illyanna puffed out a breath in a sigh, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

        They left the room and went downstairs, focusing their 
perceptions to ignore the illusions. An unwary traveler could be 
completely turned around by the mansions mystical defences, but with 
practice you could easily avoid them.

        Dr. Strange smiled ruefully, &quot;When I told you to study and 
review the spell, I didn&#39;t expect you to actually cast it.&quot; Mentally 
he added, &#39;Or succeed in casting it.&#39;

        Kitty and Illyanna silently exchanged a look, deciding that 
complicated exoplasinations probably wouldn&#39;t be a good idea. &quot;Sorry, 
sir,&quot; Kitty offered.

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Dr. Strange smiled slightly. &quot;Just don&#39;t do 
it again,&quot; he added with a sigh.

        &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; Illyanna smiled sweetly.

        &#39;I wonder if he&#39;s the one Illyanna has a crush on?&#39; Kitty 
thought, feeling an odd little stab of jealousy in her gut.

To be continued...
