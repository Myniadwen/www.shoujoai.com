Alex went and answered the door. The first thing that came into her view 
was a rather large bouquet of red roses. She then noticed the uniformed 
man with hat holding them.

&quot;For me?&quot; Alex asked with extreme anticipation.

&quot;Not sure. The order is just marked for 756 Lapeter Drive. Please sign 
here.&quot;

He handed her a clip-board with paper and pen, and she signed for it. He 
then handed her the bouquet and left.

Clover saw what happened and ran up in an excited, giddy manner. Sam 
followed from the other side of the room to see what all the fuss was 
about.

&quot;Eeeeeek! Someone got me roses!&quot; Clover squealed with joy. &quot;I wonder if 
they&#39;re from Chad. Or maybe they&#39;re from Brad. Or it could be Rick. Or 
James. Or Leon. Or Jorge,&quot; Clover stopped and thought for a second. &quot;Or 
maybe they&#39;re from Teensicle!&quot;

Alex gave her a creeped out look. &quot;I don&#39;t know, Clover. There&#39;s a card. 
Lets find out.&quot;

She opened and read it aloud, &quot;Red roses for my red-haired Sammy. Love, 
M.D.&quot; Alex, remarked cutely, &quot;Awwwwww, how sweet!&quot; She then placed the 
bouquet into Sam&#39;s arms. &quot;Sam, you didn&#39;t tell me you got a new 
boyfriend.&quot;

Sam&#39;s face became almost as red as her hair. She didn&#39;t respond. She had 
a very good idea of who the roses were from and what M.D. stood for.

&quot;Yea, Sam. Who&#39;s M.D.?&quot; Clover questioned. &quot;Is it Michael Diamond from 
history class?&quot;

&quot;Uhhh,&quot; was all Sam could manage to let out.

&quot;Or maybe it&#39;s Mark Dumas, the star running back of the football team.&quot; 
Alex guessed excitedly.

&quot;It could Mac Dunn, you know that hot biker, bad-boy.&quot;

&quot;Or maybe it&#39;s hunky actor, Matt Damon!&quot; Alex swooned.

Sam finally spat off in a nervous voice, &quot;I don&#39;t know who it is. Must 
be a secret admirer.&quot; She hated lying outside of her &quot;job,&quot; but she 
decided she had to make an exception in this case.

Alex and Clover both smiled at her. Clover put her hand on her shoulder. 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Sam. We&#39;ll find out who M.D. is for ya.&quot;

&quot;Yea, we are spies after all.&quot;

&quot;Great.&quot; Sam said with sarcasm that neither girl picked up on.

Just then the vacuum cleaner that was left lying around suddenly turned 
on and came to life. The hose started swinging around violently in the 
air, and the nozzle stretched to an unbelievable size. All three 
frightened girls were then sucked up into it.

They were now falling through a steel tunnel. &quot;I&#39;ll never look at the 
vacuum the same agaaaaaiiiiiin!&quot; Alex screamed and cried as she fell. 
Clover was screaming, as well, and attempting to cover herself up from 
any prying WOOHP cameras. Sam screamed too, but was also clutching onto 
her bouquet tightly in an effort not to ruin it.

All three girls dropped through an opening in the tunnel and fell into a 
provocative looking pile on a couch below. Luckily, Sam maneuvered 
herself so she landed on top, saving her flowers. Although she wasn&#39;t 
completely successful as many lose roses and pedals floated down on top 
of them.

The girls unraveled their selves from each other and sat down properly 
on the couch.

A skinny, fifty-something, balding man, their boss Jerry Lewis, walked 
from his desk over to Sam.

&quot;Why, Sam, how very considerate of you.&quot; He said in a British sounding 
accent as he plucked the bouquet from Sam&#39;s arms. Sam was still blushing 
brightly, but it wasn&#39;t because of Jerry.

Jerry then put the flowers up to his face, sniffing them, and recited 
off, &quot;What&#39;s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name 
would smell as sweet.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re not for you Jerry. They&#39;re from Sam&#39;s secret admirer.&quot; Alex 
told him.

&quot;Its some guy name M.D.&quot; Clover added. &quot;Hey, Jerry, can we use WOOHP&#39;s 
spy-satellites and super computers to find out who it is?&quot;

&quot;While that sounds like an intriguing use of WOOHP technology, we have 
more pressing concerns.&quot;

He then sat the bouquet down on his desk, and the giant screen in front 
of them turned on. There was an image of a long office table. Men and 
women in business attire sat in chairs that lined both sides of it. They 
all stared completely shocked at a fat, balding, middle aged man in a 
business suit standing on top of the table. He was mock strumming his 
brief case like it was a banjo and singing off-tune in a very corny 
sounding southern accent, &quot;I drunk half a bottle of Wild Turkey, because 
my wife&#39;s been cheatin&#39; on moyeeee.&quot;

&quot;Do any of you have any idea who that man is?&quot;

&quot;Is it Willie Nelson?&quot; Alex guessed.

&quot;No, Alex, it&#39;s not Willie Nelson,&quot; Sam corrected her, &quot;That&#39;s Terry 
Crawford, CEO of the fifth most profitable corporation in the world, 
Gen-Corp.&quot;

&quot;Precisely, Sam.&quot; Jerry said impressed with her as always. &quot;This is 
video footage of what was planned as a board meeting on company 
strategy. As you can see, the agenda was changed to an impromptu, solo, 
country performance by the company&#39;s CEO.&quot;

Clover asked, &quot;So some bad guy is making people sing country? That is 
like soooo evil. Now maybe if it was Ultra Loud Zone...&quot;

Jerry cut her off, &quot;There have been many other reported cases of odd 
behavior across North America, as well.&quot; The screen then switched to 
numerous faces, names, and cities of different people living across the 
United States and Canada. &quot;Your assignment is to investigate some of 
these individuals and see if you can find the root of their sudden 
change of character.&quot;

&quot;Sure thing, Jerr,&quot; Sam said now trying to focus her mind on business. 
&quot;What about gadgets?&quot;

Jerry pressed a button under his desk, and a panel flipped around on it 
revealing a number of items.

&quot;Today&#39;s selection includes the Sensible Soundproof Earmuffs, the Laser 
Lipstick, the Boomerang Buzzsaw Barrettes, and of course the Jetpack 
Backpack.&quot;

They went up and got their gadgets. There of course was a fight over the 
Boomerang Buzzsaw Barrettes, this time the barrette of contention being 
the dolphin shaped one. After wrestling for it, Sam held it up, beaming 
with victory.

&quot;There&#39;s one more thing you should know before you leave.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that Jerr?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;It&#39;s almost Fall.&quot;

&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot; All three girls screamed as the floor fell out from 
beneath them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*knock, knock, knock*

A dazed looking man opened the door and looked at the three, young 
females in business attire before him.

&quot;Hi. My names Sally Sampson. I&#39;m with the zoning commission. These are 
my assistants Alegra and Clarissa. I&#39;d like to talk to you about the 
construction that&#39;s about to take place in your municipality.&quot; Sam said 
in her attempt at a serious, public worker voice.

&quot;WHAT!&quot; The man screamed.

&quot;We&#39;ll the construction is...&quot;

She was cut off, &quot;WHAT!&quot;

Alex cut in, &quot;She said the construction is...&quot;

&quot;WHAT!&quot;

&quot;She said she wants to talk to you!&quot; Alex yelled back.

&quot;WHAT!&quot;

&quot;She said she wants to talk to you!!&quot;

&quot;WHAT!&quot;

&quot;She wants to TALK TO YOU!!!&quot; Alex was now shaking with frustration.

&quot;WHAT!&quot;

Alex slapped him across the face.

&quot;WHAT!&quot;

Alex started rolling up her sleeve. Sam grabbed her arm to restrain her, 
&quot;Alex, I think that&#39;s all he can say.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to go inside now.&quot; Sam said.

&quot;OKAY!&quot;

They walked by him, he made no attempt to stop them.

&quot;What a dump!&quot; Clover remarked. The place was indeed a mess, with food, 
trash, and other items lying all over the place.

&quot;WHAT!&quot;

&quot;Ok, were going to play a game called hide in the closet.&quot; Alex said as 
she started pushing him towards it. &quot;You win if you can stay in there 
until we leave.&quot;

&quot;OKAY!&quot; Alex then pushed him into the closet and slammed the door shut. 
Muffled what&#39;s and the occasional okay could still be heard.

They started combing through all the debris trying to spot anything that 
could be a clue. They didn&#39;t find anything of note until Sam noticed 
that the CD player to his sound system was still running. She deduced 
the speakers had all blown out. She ejected the CD and examined it. It 
was Hillbilly Jamboree by the Da Crunk Boyz.

&quot;Girls I think this is what we were looking for.&quot;

They went to more homes, where similar events occurred. Their next stop 
was in Madison, Wisconsin.

*knock, knock, knock*

&quot;Hi. My names Sally...&quot;

&quot;CONFUSING WHAT IS REAAAAL!!!&quot; The man screamed. Hideous noise was 
playing in the background.

Sam, Clover, and Alex looked at each other, nodded, and then proceeded 
to slip on their Sensible Soundproof Earmuffs. They then pushed their 
way past the man, and he made no attempt to stop them, continuing to 
scream to himself. They went directly to his stereo where Sam ejected 
the CD. She examined if for a second. It was Man-Cry Theory by Stinkin 
Park.

&quot;Ok, let&#39;s send this one to Jerry.&quot;

&quot;What did you say?&quot; Alex asked talking very loudly. Clover took off 
Alex&#39;s earmuffs and handed them to her. Sam then opened up her X-Powder, 
and switched on her link to Jerry.

&quot;Jerry, we got one more for ya.&quot;

&quot;Ok, Sam, send it over.&quot; A purple laser shot out of the bottom of the 
X-Powder and scanned the CD. When it was done, Sam tossed the disc on 
the ground. &quot;Have you found any new information?&quot;

&quot;No. I still can&#39;t find anything detectable that would distinguish it 
from your average, store-bought, music CD.&quot;

&quot;Good, can we go home now?&quot; Clover whined.

&quot;However, we&#39;ve researched the history of these CDs and there is a link 
between them. They were all published by different labels, manufactured 
in different factories, but they all share the same distributor, a 
company named Silver Star.&quot;

&quot;Silver... Star.&quot; Sam put her hand on her chin thought to herself for a 
second. &quot;This all did seem very familiar. Jerry, there hasn&#39;t been any 
recent escapes from the WOOHP maximum security prison has there?&quot;

Jerry glanced at his computer for a second, &quot;Yes, actually, there has.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The girls were now back in school, and walking together again before 
their Earth Science class.

&quot;Sam, I talked to Mark Dumas during gym today. He said he didn&#39;t send 
you the flowers,&quot; Alex told her.

&quot;I talked to Michael Diamond, Mitch Daniels, Major Donahue, Mac Dunn, 
and Max Dix. I don&#39;t think they sent the roses either. But I did score 
some digits!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s great Clover. But really, you guys don&#39;t have to do this. I&#39;m 
serious.&quot; Sam replied dryly.

&quot;But we&#39;re your best friends, Sam,&quot; Alex told her assuringly. &quot;Of course 
were going to help you find out who M.D. is.&quot;

Then she saw her. Sam&#39;s heart felt like it was going to jump out of her 
chest. She must have over heard their conversation. She glanced at Sam 
for a moment before she spoke.

&quot;What&#39;s up loOOsers?&quot;

&quot;Just your huge, inflated head, Mandy,&quot; Clover sneered.

&quot;Nice face Clover. Who does your make-up? Bozo the Clown?&quot;

&quot;UGHH!&quot; Alex and Sam had to restrain her arms so she didn&#39;t jump her 
that second.

Mandy smirked and walked past them with her chin up as usual.

Finally Clover calmed down enough for them to let her go. &quot;Yea, she&#39;s 
reaaaal nice, Sam.&quot;

Sam just shrugged her shoulders. But she was a lot more puzzled than she 
let on.

They went to their Science class, almost being tardy again. Sam sat down 
and took out her note book and pencil. The lecture soon began. She began 
taking notes, but her mind started wandering elsewhere. She had been 
paying close attention to Mandy all day. It seemed as if nothing had 
changed between them, as if that night had never happened. In fact, 
Mandy had been acting as bratty, arrogant, and egotistical as ever. She 
wondered what had happened to that honest sweetness she had shown her 
before. Which one was real the Mandy? Sam glanced over in Mandy&#39;s 
direction for a moment and looked at her. She looked like she did any 
other day. She was wearing one her short, violet, designer dresses. Her 
skin was a fair creamy complexion except for that one, small mole right 
below her right eye. Her hair was long, smooth, and seemingly darker 
than pitch black. Mandy then leaned back in her chair. She started 
running her fingers over her ear through her hair slowly. A playful 
smile developed on her face. Sam quickly turned back down to her notes. 
She must&#39;ve noticed her looking. Sam was usually very attentive in 
class, but today she didn&#39;t spend very much time thinking about Earth 
Science.

Finally, after another drawn out, lifeless lecture, that no one would 
ever remember, the bell rang, and the mass of students rushed towards 
the exit. Sam took a little extra time getting her stuff ready to leave, 
and Mandy did the same. Soon they were the only ones left in the 
class-room. Sam walked over to her.

&quot;Mandy, I..&quot;

&quot;Shhhhhhhh,&quot; Mandy whispered with her finger over her lips. She then 
winked into Sam&#39;s green eyes and passed by and through the door.

Sam went back to her friends, and the day proceeded seemingly as normal. 
She went to more classes, took more notes, and listened hopelessly as 
Alex and Clover argued over their theories of who Sam&#39;s secret admirer 
was. She didn&#39;t see Mandy again until near the end of the school day.

Sam was exiting the women&#39;s rest-room when she looked down the hall. 
From a distance and could see Clover flirting with the ridiculously 
handsome Chad Hardy. Sam shook her head at how obvious her methods of 
flirtation were even from this distance. She then noticed Mandy who was 
approaching them with her hands stacked with books. When she got close 
enough, Mandy performed a painfully, obvious fake trip. Her books went 
everywhere, and she latched onto Chad&#39;s tall, muscular frame to prevent 
herself from &quot;falling.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m soooo sorry, Chad.&quot;

&quot;Its ok, Mandy.&quot; Chad grinned. &quot;Why don&#39;t I help you with those?&quot; He 
picked up all her books and they started walking together further down 
the hall. Mandy latched onto his arm, cocked her head around, and stuck 
her tongue out at the now fuming Clover.

Sam started walking in the opposite direction. What she had seen made 
her angry, but over-all she couldn&#39;t help but feel extremely 
disappointed.
