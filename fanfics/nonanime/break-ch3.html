<h1>Break Shadow (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/break-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The Teen Titans burst through the already damaged metal door to one of 
Black City&#39;s multiple warehouses, ready for the reported group of 
robbers.  However, everything was silent in the massive place.  There 
were no cries of anger towards the heroes that usually accompanied 
their arrival.  Apart from the smashed door, there was no evidence to 
show the robbers had ever been there.

&quot;If you&#39;re looking for those thugs, they&#39;re over there,&quot; a voice said 
from behind the team of five.  &quot;Encased in ice, just as your police 
seem to like them.&quot;  The team whirled in unison, expecting a fight.  
Their eyes fell upon the demon Chaos, who seemed to be smirking at 
them.  Raven&#39;s hands tightened as she stepped forwards.

&quot;What are you doing here, Chaos?&quot; she demanded to know.  Chaos grinned, 
flashing her eerie fangs.

&quot;I was doing one more good deed for you,&quot; she said.  &quot;I was hoping that 
if I stopped a few thugs for you, you might heal my eyes for me.  
Demons don&#39;t have much luck asking healers for help.&quot;  Raven sighed, 
frowning at the blind demon woman.

&quot;If I restore your sight, will you tell me why you kissed me?&quot; the 
sorceress inquired.  Chaos&#39; grin increased, as if she was having fun 
listening to Raven&#39;s emotional distress.

&quot;Of course,&quot; she chuckled.  &quot;An eye for an eye, as the human saying 
goes.&quot;  Raven ignored the peculiar statement and lifted her hands to 
rest over Chaos&#39; covered eyes.  She called up the holy blood within 
herself and let the healing energy flow out into Chaos.  After a 
moment, she lowered her hands and backed away.  Chaos grabbed the 
blindfold with one of her clawed hands and pulled it away.  She turned 
about and looked up to the quarter moon in the starlit night sky.

&quot;How wonderful to see that moon after eight years,&quot; she sighed, 
grinning at her restored sight.  &quot;And now I can decipher what exactly 
this strange little emblem is.&quot;  She lifted a disc to examine it in the 
moonlight, and Robin scowled.  The disc carried the trademark angular S 
that Slade used.

&quot;Did your dog take that off the robbers?&quot; Robin asked.  Chaos turned 
around and smirked at the Boy Wonder.

&quot;No,&quot; she said, flipping the disc as if it were an oversized quarter.  
&quot;A peculiar man with a deep voice gave it to me a few nights ago before 
I came here to find my former student.  Familiar with it, bird boy?&quot;

&quot;Slade,&quot; Robin snarled.  &quot;What business does he have with you?  Why&#39;d 
he give you that disc?&quot;

&quot;He told me what direction I should go to find Raven,&quot; Chaos replied.  
&quot;Before I left, he gave me that disc and said he just might find me 
here.&quot;  Robin&#39;s teeth were clenched in rage, but Beast Boy spoke up 
before the leader of the team could demand more information.

&quot;Didn&#39;t you say you were going to tell Raven why you smooched her?&quot; he 
asked bluntly.  Raven glared at him, but he shrugged it off as he 
always did.  Chaos snickered and caught Slade&#39;s disc once more before 
turning to Raven.

&quot;Call it another eye for an eye,&quot; the pureblood demon laughed.  &quot;You 
caused me physical pain, so I caused you some mental anguish.  I can 
see it in your eyes now.  That and I&#39;ve always liked seeing you 
squirm.&quot;

&quot;So it meant nothing?&quot; Starfire questioned.  Chaos chuckled at the 
innocent alien&#39;s speech.

&quot;Of course not,&quot; the demon answered.  &quot;Raven was my student because I 
didn&#39;t want any damned angels coming after me for letting their 
prophecy child die.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t explain a kiss,&quot; Raven murmured.  Chaos smirked and 
strode to the sorceress, standing nose to nose with the girl.

&quot;Demons can be fairly possessive, Raven,&quot; the tall woman said.  &quot;I&#39;m 
just selfish enough to want to steal your first kiss.&quot;  After a moment, 
she stood straight and started to walk away.  &quot;But I can see I&#39;m not 
your type.  I think someone a little more innocent is right up your 
alley.  Perhaps someone with bright green eyes.&quot;  The demon paused and 
turned about, drawing her sword from the sheath on her back.

An empty oil drum sliced itself open on her blade, the black shadows 
fading as the object broke.  Chaos grinned and let out a terrifying 
laugh, red eyes filled with twisted amusement.

&quot;And now I&#39;ve managed to get your feathers ruffled, Raven!&quot; she 
laughed.  &quot;Overprotective of your odd little teammate, aren&#39;t you?  
Raven frowned, her hands surrounded by shadows and her eyes gleaming 
white.  Massive objects lifted from the ground and flew at Chaos.  The 
demon cut through each item with her terrifying, horrible laugh.

&quot;Careful now, Raven!&quot; Chaos shouted through all the sounds of metal 
being torn to shreds.  &quot;Get any angrier and you just might let your 
father show!&quot;  Raven ignored her previous master and wrenched things 
that were bolted into the floor up into the air.  The warehouse began 
to shake as Raven ripped up everything that her magic could touch.  Her 
eyes began to gleam a soft red.  Cyborg and Beast Boy shouted in shock 
and ran to their comrade.

&quot;Raven, calm down!&quot; Beast Boy shrieked in utter terror.  &quot;Don&#39;t go all 
freaky on us!  This isn&#39;t something to get angry about!&quot;  Raven 
pointedly ignored him and continued to demolish the warehouse.  Chaos 
had opted to increase the destruction by sheathing her sword and 
summoning her black fire.  She was consumed by smoke and flame.

&quot;Raven!&quot; Starfire called out, rushing to her teammate.  &quot;Please stop!  
You may destroy this entire building!&quot;  She dared to reach out and 
grasp Raven&#39;s wrists to try and stop the attacks.  Raven glared at the 
red-haired girl, her teeth bared in a feral snarl.  It seemed for a 
moment that she would turn her magic to strike out at Starfire.  
Despite all of the sorceress&#39; anger, she managed to stop herself from 
acting any further with her emotions.

The smoke and fire that had hidden Chaos had faded away.  Chaos had 
utterly vanished from the scene.  Raven stared at the place where the 
demon had stood before walking out of the warehouse.  Starfire jogged 
after her, pulling her arm from Robin&#39;s grasp when he tried to stop 
her.

&quot;Friend Raven?&quot; Starfire questioned, walking quickly to match Raven&#39;s 
hastened pace.  &quot;Are you well?&quot;

&quot;Go away, Starfire,&quot; Raven replied, picking up her pace.  Starfire 
matched the shorter girl easily, not leaving Raven&#39;s side.

&quot;Please, Raven,&quot; the alien pleaded.  &quot;You may tell me what is wrong.  
You know that I am trustworthy.&quot;  Raven leapt from the ground and flew 
off at top speed.  Starfire raced after her into the cloudy sky.

&quot;Raven, please, tell me what is wrong!&quot; Starfire called out across the 
sky.  &quot;You must trust me!  I am your friend!&quot;  When Raven did not 
respond, Starfire launched herself forwards one final time.  She 
grabbed Raven around the waist and stopped the sorceress from going any 
further.

&quot;Let me go, Starfire,&quot; Raven said flatly.

&quot;Not until you tell me what is so troublesome,&quot; Starfire replied.  
Raven frowned, but relented.  She glanced down and spotted the Titan&#39;s 
Tower, and the two swooped down to stand on the roof.  Raven stood away 
from Starfire, arms crossed over her chest.

&quot;Anger is a problem for me,&quot; the dark-haired girl said softly, sitting 
down on the edge of the roof.  &quot;Unfortunately, Chaos seems to enjoy 
making me angry.  When I get angry, something in the very back of my 
mind wakes up and tries to make sure that I live out exactly what my 
father would prefer.&quot;

&quot;Your father?&quot; Starfire questioned.

&quot;Yes, her father.&quot;

The two girls looked up to see water rising up around the Tower in what 
seemed like a circular tidal wave.  The water froze as it gathered in a 
perfect dome.  For a moment, the moonlight reflected off of each facet 
of ice and lit up the small peninsula that held Titan&#39;s Tower.  Then a 
layer of gleaming metal covered the ice.  The reflected light was 
captured within the polished metal dome and it was as bight as day 
during midnight.

Heavy footsteps rang out in the sudden silence, as well as the scraping 
of a sharp object against the rooftop.  Starfire and Raven whirled 
about and found Chaos standing a short distance from them, sword drawn 
and craving a line into the roof.  She was grinning her horrendous 
grin, red eyes bright in the eerie light.

&quot;How did you get here?&quot; Raven questioned.  &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;A bit of fun before I slaughter your protectorate city and the rest of 
the humans in this world,&quot; Chaos chuckled.  &quot;I&#39;m going to kidnap you 
and make sure that I pay you back for those eight years of pointless 
&#39;teaching&#39; and doing what those damned angels made me think was the 
right thing to do!  What in the seven hells was I thinking?  My father 
must be ridiculously disappointed in me, just as your father is 
disgusted with you!&quot;

&quot;Who is your father?&quot; Starfire asked even as she readied energy around 
her hands.

&quot;Lucifer himself,&quot; Raven answered in the demon&#39;s stead.  &quot;She&#39;s the 
heir to Hell.  Chaos, if you try to kidnap me, you&#39;ll be in for a fight 
unlike any other.&quot;  Chaos laughed, her voice echoing in the solid dome.

&quot;I never ever said I was kidnapping you, little blackbird,&quot; she 
snickered.  &quot;You need to watch your opponent&#39;s eyes more closely.&quot;  A 
scream suddenly sounded.  Raven whirled about to see Starfire firing 
star bolts at multiple, bestial incarnations of elements.  She realized 
that Chaos was not after her, but after Starfire.

&quot;Leave her be!&quot; Raven turned and shouted at the pureblood demon woman.  
&quot;Your battle is with me!  Don&#39;t you dare get anyone else involved!&quot;  
Chaos grinned at her.

&quot;If you truly do not want me to steal away your precious ally, then 
admit what will trigger your emotions,&quot; she leered.  &quot;You know what I 
mean.  Say it!  Admit your anger!  Admit your fear!  Admit your 
emotions!&quot;  Starfire gasped and cried out as a serpent of ice struck 
her foot and encased it in rime.  She fell to the roof, immobilized 
from pain and the weight of the frozen block.

&quot;I...&quot; Raven said, looking between Chaos and Starfire in desperation.  
&quot;I...can&#39;t.&quot;  Chaos&#39; grin grew larger at Raven&#39;s admission.  Starfire 
let out a scream as she was encased in ice.  Raven jumped at her cry 
and ran towards her friend, but Starfire vanished in a flash of fire.  
The dark-haired girl froze, her eyes wide at the wisp of steam that 
rose from the roof.  Starfire was...gone.

Chaos laughed wickedly and threw her arms to the sky.  The metal and 
ice shattered and crashed down into the bay.  She summoned her black 
fire and sent it hurtling towards Raven.  Raven, however, had stopped 
dead in her tracks and didn&#39;t even notice the fire rushing at her.  
Chaos vanished in a final, massive explosion that consumed the entirety 
of the Tower&#39;s rooftop.  Her laugh echoed in the night.
