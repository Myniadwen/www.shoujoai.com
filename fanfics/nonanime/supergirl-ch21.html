<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 21 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/supergirl-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>        &quot;Outsiders?&quot; B-ko murmured as she worked on the final 
preparations. Her battlesuit&#39;s helmet sat on a counter nearby, the 
faceplate clear once again, reflecting the chamber all around them. The 
android hung from several connections on the ceiling, looking just like 
a redheaded young woman of about sixteen years old.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Oracle agreed, &quot;they&#39;re recently been sighted in Opal 
City. I&#39;m still researching the team&#39;s make-up, but so far they seem to 
be operating on the side of the angels.&quot;

        &quot;And what about the other team?&quot; B-ko asked her curiously, the 
blue haired young woman&#39;s face entirely hidden by the open access panels 
in the back of the android as she made a few final adjustments to the 
internal systems.

        &quot;The Titans,&quot; Oracle said as she watched B-ko work, &quot;my old 
friend Nightwing seems to be reorganizing them. They&#39;re reactivated 
Titans Tower and are meeting semi-regularly.&quot;

        &quot;There we go,&quot; B-ko wiped off her hands on a rag, then she 
carefully closed up the hatches on the back of the android. &quot;Activate 
the modem connection,&quot; she turned to look at the Oracle hologram, &quot;let&#39;s 
see how it&#39;s working.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; the Oracle hologram flickered a moment, then it simply 
disappeared as her attention was focused elsewhere. The android 
twitched, the head came up to look around, then she took a deep breath. 
In a quiet voice she said, &quot;Wow.&quot;

        &quot;Sounds good,&quot; B-ko began to disconnect the various connections 
to the Watchtower&#39;s internal systems, &quot;so how does it feel?&quot;

        &quot;Human,&quot; Oracle sounded delighted. She twisted and turned, 
admiring her new redheaded form. She looked up, a blush on her cheeks, 
and in surprise she touched those cheeks with her fingertips, &quot;I can 
even blush! B- ko, you&#39;re an artist.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s the little details that count,&quot; the armor clad B-ko walked 
over to the workbench. She picked up a robe and walked back, &quot;Here you 
go.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Oracle quickly pulled the robe on over her nudity, &quot;I 
just noticed that you made this body anatomically correct.&quot; She looked 
over at B- ko with a blush, &quot;I&#39;m not quite sure how to ask this... but 
does everything work?&quot;

        &quot;I haven&#39;t actually tried it out myself,&quot; B-ko said with a great 
deal of dignity, a little smile teasing at her lips, &quot;but yes, it should 
all work.&quot;

        &quot;Incredible,&quot; Oracle muttered, her read hair falling into her 
eyes. &quot;How did you manage this?&quot; she murmured, the woman in the long 
robe walking hesitantly around the room.

        &quot;I had a lot of help,&quot; B-ko shrugged slightly. &quot;The JLA&#39;s old 
enemy Professor Ivo had a lot of experience building androids, and we&#39;ve 
got most of his files in the database,&quot; she explained. A grin, &quot;Not that 
I didn&#39;t make some improvements, of course.&quot;

        &quot;So what are my limits?&quot; Oracle asked curiously, looking back at 
B- ko.

        &quot;There&#39;s one big one,&quot; B-ko admitted. &quot;The transmission range 
for you operating this is pretty short, at least for now. You can go 
anywhere in the Watchtower, but that&#39;s it,&quot; she said.

        &quot;The Watchtower,&quot; Oracle repeated, then she smiled. &quot;And to 
think, I was worried I&#39;d be limited to this workroom or something! This 
is great,&quot; she laughed.

        &quot;Good,&quot; B-ko grinned back, &quot;now lets get you some clothes and 
stuff. You&#39;ve got teammates to meet, things to do, all that stuff.&quot;

        &quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Oracle agreed. &quot;There&#39;s some clothes 
stored in the lockers by the teleporters,&quot; she noted as the two walked 
out together. They went down the hallway, and the oddest look appeared 
on Oracle&#39;s face.

        &quot;What?&quot; B-ko looked over at her curiously.

        &quot;I can even smell the air.. there&#39;s a metallic scent to the 
air,&quot; Oracle softly noted, &quot;and it&#39;s a bit dry.&quot; She tilted her head to 
the side, and B-ko heard a soft rumble, &quot;Humidifier on, and I&#39;ve boosted 
air recycling, just in case.&quot;

        There was a sound of conversation, then Flash and Green Lantern 
came around the corner, talking softly. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have gushed over 
Firestorm like that,&quot; Kyla noted, her greenish black hair falling into 
her eyes, &quot;he sure left in a hurry.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Iris sighed. The Flash perked up, &quot;He sure was cute, 
though.&quot;

        Kyla took in the two women walking up the hall, then she got a 
good look at the redhead. Her eyes widened slightly, &quot;B-ko, who&#39;s your 
friend?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m Oracle, actually,&quot; she smiled slightly, green eyes looking 
more amused than anything else, &quot;So what do you think of my new body?&quot;

        &quot;Very nice,&quot; Iris bounced in place cheerfully, then she looked 
over to take in her friend&#39;s faint blush and grinned.

        &quot;You look great,&quot; Kyla felt herself blushing slightly, to her 
general irritation.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Oracle smiled. She looked up at B-ko, &quot;We should 
probably go get those clothes, I&#39;m feeling a bit of a draft.&quot;

        &quot;Here,&quot; Kyla concentrated, and her power ring flared once. In a 
moment Oracle was wearing a simple set of sweatpants made up of glowing 
green energy. &quot;You can just slip them off when you get your clothes,&quot; 
she said, &quot;the ring constructs will just dissipate.&quot;

        &quot;Did you give her matching underwear?&quot; Iris asked curiously, her 
sandy brown hair swept back from her face.

        &quot;Iris!&quot; Kyla growled.

        &quot;Thank you again,&quot; Oracle laughed softly before she and B-ko 
headed up the hallway towards the teleporters and the changing rooms.

        Iris waited until both of them had walked away before she looked 
over at the still faintly blushing Kyla, &quot;Liked what you saw?&quot;

        &quot;Don&#39;t start with me,&quot; Kyla quickly warned her best friend, &quot;I&#39;m 
sure I can still manage to spank you with a ring-construct.&quot;

        Iris snickered softly as they walked in the other direction, 
towards the meeting room. &quot;And wouldn&#39;t our more perverted fans love 
that image?&quot; she laughed.

        Kyla snickered softly, &quot;True.&quot; They walked on a few moments 
before Kyla smiled slightly, &quot;Oracle sure was cute, though.&quot;

        &quot;I noticed,&quot; Iris smiled at her wickedly, &quot;and I think Oracle 
noticed you noticing that, if you know what I mean.&quot;

        Kyla winced, &quot;Oh boy.&quot;

        Over by the teleporters Oracle smiled as she picked up a simple 
shirt and pants. She blushed slightly as B-ko handed her over matching 
underwear, &quot;Sorry, forgot.&quot;

        &quot;No problem,&quot; B-ko said as Oracle went in to change. She leaned 
up against the wall, hands behind her head. &quot;Any news from Superman and 
Wonder Woman?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Nothing yet,&quot; Oracle&#39;s voice came from inside, &quot;and to be 
honest I&#39;m getting worried. Even if they&#39;re in deep space, the 
Watchtower systems should be able to pick up some message.&quot;

        &quot;I understand that Kyla&#39;s got the Green Lanterns out looking,&quot; 
B-ko offered, &quot;hopefully we&#39;ll hear something soon.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s hope,&quot; Oracle agreed, stepping out of the change room. 
The pants hugged her hips down to the ankles, while the shirt was loose 
but comfortable. &quot;I think I&#39;ll order some more stuff on-line,&quot; Oracle 
tugged at the shirt, &quot;have one of you pick it up for me.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe I got a little carried away,&quot; B-ko softly admitted, &quot;but 
I did use the measurements from when you were a teenager.&quot;

        &quot;I had this happen to me back then, too,&quot; Oracle reassured her. 
They walked towards the meeting room and she added with a smile, &quot;I 
thought Kyla was pretty cute, blushing like that and all.&quot;

        &quot;You think she likes you?&quot; B-ko asked curiously.

        &quot;She doesn&#39;t really know me yet,&quot; Oracle pointed out. With a 
devilish smirk she added, &quot;But that doesn&#39;t rule out lust at first 
sight.&quot;

        &quot;At least now,&quot; B-ko noted, &quot;you&#39;ve got the option of actually 
doing something about it.&quot;

        Oracle nodded, &quot;That&#39;s true.&quot; A smile, &quot;Not that I have any 
plans to. I think I want to get used to having a body, before I actually 
decide to start using it.&quot;

        The meeting room was oddly quiet as they walked inside, and B-ko 
instantly sensed something was wrong. &quot;What happened?&quot; she asked 
crisply.

        &quot;The Green Lanterns followed the warp trail from Almerac to 
Apokolips,&quot; A-ko said softly, &quot;the planet has been devastated.&quot;

        &quot;There were no survivors,&quot; J&#39;onn J&#39;onz said to them gravely, the 
Martian Manhunter looking especially grim.

        &quot;Darkseid and the New Gods of Apokolips have been destroyed?&quot; 
Oracle blinked. She shook her head grimly, &quot;This enemy, whoever it is, 
is incredibly powerful.&quot;

        &quot;And according to the information the Green Lanterns there 
collected,&quot; Kyla added, &quot;the enemy is on it&#39;s way to Earth.&quot;

        &quot;How long?&quot; A-ko asked softly.

        &quot;A few weeks,&quot; Kyla offered, &quot;maybe a bit longer. They seem to 
be taking a round-about course, for some reason.&quot;

        &quot;Then we&#39;d better be ready to meet them,&quot; Helena said as she 
stepped from the shadows, her Kestrel uniform&#39;s cape swirling around 
her.</pre>
