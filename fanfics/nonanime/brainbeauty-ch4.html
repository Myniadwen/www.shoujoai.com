<a href="../nonanime/brainbeauty-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>4: ON THE FOURTH DAY (Stop It, I Love It) 

From time to time, the girls would use the toilet and head back to the 
bed. Yet Daria in a way, wished what happened that night was all a 
dream, and that she would wake up, on her own bed, in House 
Morgendorffer. 

No luck at all. For at 6:00 A. M., the auburn chanced to wonder if she 
WAS at home. Waking up, she squinted, till it dawned on her she needed 
her glasses. Reaching for the nightstand, she got them on--and 
discovered the hard way she was still in room 2112 on the 21st floor of 
The Red Barchetta Hotel. Naked. The clock tower overhead chiming 6:00. 
And to top it off, an equally naked Sandi Griffin with her, her arm 
&#39;round Daria, her head on the cynic&#39;s breasts.

Gently pulling free so the she didn&#39;t wake up the brunette, the auburn 
climbed from the bed and used the bathroom to answer nature&#39;s call and 
to shower. After she had dried off, the nude cynic headed to the window, 
and peeped twixt the curtains, observing the waking activity of Lawndale 
take place.

&quot;Please, a brain stroke,&quot; she murmured. The fact that she had made love 
with Quinn&#39;s best friend, the snobby head of The Fashion Club, that gave 
new meaning to sleeping with the enemy. And yet, she enjoyed it. It was 
concentrated passion in a can that exploded like the reactors at 
Chernobyl.

But the fact that she had sex--and lesbian sex, no less, was no joke. 
Especially when it came to The Morgendorffer/ Griffin war. And the war 
twixt the unpopular and the popular. What Daria and Sandi now had was 
what the Latin community termed as amor prohibito--forbidden love. But 
for what it was worth, that implelling force which brought them to their 
goal, had been the manifestation to....a phase, maybe? For the moment, 
Daria had no idea where to go from there, now that she and Sandi got 
what they came for. Was it worth it? Whatever the reason, she went back 
to bed--just as the sweetly yawning brunette re entwined her arms &#39;round 
the auburn, holding her while they kissed. From there, The Fashion 
Clubber laid her head on the cynic&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Good morning, lovergirl, &quot; she said. &quot;I had a feeling you&#39;d come back 
to me.&quot;

&quot;Something tells me I&#39;ve come a long way from Quinn&#39;s cousin or 
whatever.&quot;

Laughing gently, the brunette said, &quot;That you did. And once again, I 
proved to you there WAS a lovergirl within you. You were GREAT. Like, 
you surprised me last night&quot;

&quot;Now that you&#39;ve opened up my Al Capone vault,&quot; said the auburn, &quot;where 
do we go from here? Word gets around in Lawndale.&quot;

&quot;I hope not. My life would be over if everyone knew that I love girls 
like you!!&quot;

&quot;Tell me all &#39;bout it,&quot; murmured Daria, thinking over when Kevin and 
Brittany had overheard Sandi&#39;s confession to Tiffany. But that wasn&#39;t 
all--remembering that she WAS dating Tom Sloane, it occured that the 
cynic had cheated on Tom, that she had made love with another girl. Yet 
the fact she and Tom would be split up when they went to their seperate 
collages....

She came out of her reverie just as the brunette propped herself on one 
elbow saying, &quot;All that time....I didn&#39;t even know we each had a 
different side of ourselves. I never even felt that way when you made 
love to me last night.&quot;

&quot;Neither did I,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;I didn&#39;t even think you, of all 
people, the narcisstic and cliquey head of The Fashion Club, had another 
side to you. But then, it beats getting tormented by two knuckleheads 
from Highland that were worse than your brothers and Upchuck combined.&quot;

&quot;My brothers, I wouldn&#39;t doubt, but worse than Upchuck?&quot;

&quot;Yup. And Beavis and Butt Head were their names.&quot;

For the third time, Sandi was laughing. &quot;Butt Head? BUTT HEAD?!?&quot;

Shrugging, Daria replied, &quot;Let&#39;s just say his mom was high on morphine 
at the time.&quot;

&quot;Like, drugs suck. Even The Fashion Club would think twice &#39;bout using 
drugs, no matter how popular they get.&quot;

&quot;Amen. You should see what it did to Beavis and Butt Head.&quot;

There was a pause before Sandi stated, &quot;Daria.....I got some confessions 
to make.&quot;

&quot;That you formed The Fashion Club just to date girls?&quot; asked Daria.

Glaring at the surprised auburn, the brunette said crisply, &quot;Stop it, 
Daria!! Be serious!!&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot;

As somber as she could, Sandi said, &quot;Like....., that day I chased 
you........when Quinn, Stacy, Tiffany and me were on our way to 
Cashman&#39;s, I sensed there was something strange when Quinn said she&#39;d 
meet up later. The fact that I also saw you and Jane....I knew something 
was up, so I told Stacy and Tiffany to meet me at Cashman&#39;s, and 
followed Quinn at a distance, till she was in that railroad tunnel with 
you and your friend. When you didn&#39;t come out, I waited till the train 
came out and went inside. I saw you between the cars, and that was when 
I confronted you the best way I could. Quinn thought she could be 
sneaky, but I can be sneakier.&quot;

&quot;Ah......,&quot; said Daria. &quot;Then----it WAS you, inside R. R. Tunnel No. 
558.&quot;

Sandi nodded. &quot;I wanted to tell you then--to tell you I loved you....&quot;

&quot;I thought so.....so......anything else you can relate to me on?&quot;

&quot;Just one other thing...........as much as it hurts the image, if not my 
reputation, as the President of The Fashion Club, I got something, all 
joking aside, to say.....&quot; The brunette took a breath before saying the 
following words--which was a shock to the auburn:

&quot;I envy you, Daria Morgendorffer.&quot;

Unable to believe what she had just heard, Daria blurted out, &quot;WHAT?!?&quot;

&quot;Like, it&#39;s no joke,&quot; said Sandi, who sounded beyond serious. &quot;You don&#39;t 
know how lucky you can be to have a sister like Quinn.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot;

&quot;Yup. All I got to show for, is two rug rat brothers that play a LOT of 
havoc on me, make me at times CRY!! I never even had a sister!! Like, I 
WISH I had a sister....&quot;

&quot;Brittany&#39;s got a brother that does the same stuff,&quot; said the auburn.

&quot;True,&quot; agreed the brunette. &quot;For Brittany, one brat of a brother is one 
thing, but the two I got is a nightmare!!&quot;

&quot;Now that I think of it, you&#39;d think we&#39;d get along ourselves since 
we&#39;re united by one thing.&quot; From there, Sandi and Daria said in unison:

&quot;Quinn.&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; said the cynic. &quot;That ol&#39; love/hate relationship with Quinn....&quot;

Sighing, the fashion diva said, &quot;I wish we could love all over again.&quot;

&quot;The thing is,&quot; said the auburn, who was now enticed with Sandi&#39;s 
breast, which was rubbing against her, its nipple hard, &quot;CAN it be done 
again?&quot;

Triggered by the feel of that nipple, Daria found herself unable to 
control herself, as she clamped her mouth onto Sandi&#39;s nipple and breast 
and suckled it.

&quot;Oh, that is SO good,&quot; sighed the brunette. &quot;So you still want more, do 
you?&quot;

Stopping for a moment, the auburn said, &quot;The fact we don&#39;t have to 
report for school till 9:00, we&#39;ve got 6:00 to relive last night and 
take our time slow for the love and use the two hours in between to get 
ready.&quot;

&quot;So be it........lovergirl.....&quot; So saying, Sandi pulled the sheet off 
them before she fed her breasts to Daria, who was now thinking and 
hearing (?) a tune in her mind--The Eagles&#39; The Sad Cafe:

Out in the shiny night, the rain 
was softly falling 
The tracks that ran down the boulevard had 
all been washed away 
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling 
and I remember the times we spent 
inside the Sad Cafe 

&quot;MMMM.........that is, soooooooo gooooooood, Daria, give me more. I love 
it when I feed my breasts to you........ohhhhhhhh......!!&quot; sighed the 
brunette, while the auburn, at one point, flicked her tongue tip along 
the nipple.

After that, it was Sandi&#39;s turn to suck Daria&#39;s breasts and nipples, 
which she did, like a hungry baby. &quot;Do you like it?&quot; she asked.

&quot;So....so goooood....give me more....&quot; was the reply.

Oh, it seemed like a holy place, 
protected by amazing grace 
and we would sing right out loud, the 
things we could not say 
We thought we could change this world
with words like &quot;love&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; 
We were part of the lonely crowd 
Inside the Sad Cafe 

Each girl took her time to lick, suck and kiss. With each nipple 
engorged with blood, each girl rubbed and caressed them, sending pulses 
of sparks along up their bodies. Then they sucked them hard, causing 
themselves to shake, rattle and roll. From there, they caressed their 
bodies before Daria was using her tongue work in Sandi&#39;s clitoris and 
vagina, pushing her tongue in and out.

&quot;MMMMMMMM.......,&quot; sighed the brunette. &quot;Give it to me, baby....give it 
to me SO GOOOOOOD!! Oh, lovergirl.........!!&quot; Using her index and center 
finger, she stuck and slid it in and out the auburn&#39;s vagina, causing 
her to moan in the vaginal folds, tonguing even deeper.

Oh, expecting to fly, 
we would meet on that beautiful
shore in the sweet by and by 
Some of their dreams came true, 
some just passed away 
and some of the stayed behind 
inside the Sad Cafe. 

When it was Daria&#39;s turn, she was laying on her back, sliding her finger 
in and out from the vagina of a moaning and sexually charged Sandi, who 
was doing her tongue work on the cynic&#39;s wet vagina and clit. Both girls 
were moaning and sighing with pleasure in an absolute frenzy, Daria 
writhing as before and pitching her head back while Sandi tongued 
deeper--and that caused the auburn to call out, 
&quot;Oh........Ohh.........Ohhh.........Ohhhh.......OHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!&quot;

&quot;You love that, sweetie?&quot; said the brunette.

&quot;I love it............!!&quot;

&quot;Mmm, I love you.......&quot;

From there, the girls went into a 69 pose, their moans covered by the 
tonguing in each other&#39;s vagina. 

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore 
Now that Glory Train, it don&#39;t stop here no more 
Now I look at the years gone by, 
and wonder at the powers that be. 

After that, Sandi was laying on her back, with Daria on top of her, 
their breasts, nipples, bodies, tongues and mouths pressing together, 
while each girl was using her index and center finger to slide in and 
out, slow and fast, gentle and hard, in each other&#39;s vagina, while their 
vaginal fluids poured, while teasing each other&#39;s clitoris. All that, 
combined with their intense French kissing, built up all the passion 
that surged through like some kind of time warp, while they kissed more 
and more intensely, moaning in their kissing mouths. 

I don&#39;t know why fortune smiles on some 
and lets the rest go free 
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall 
but things in this life change very slowly, 
if they ever change at all 

Sandi and Daria were holding each other closer than before, clenching 
each other&#39;s hair, kissing deeper and probing their vaginas and 
clitorises even more passionate beyond, yet doing so slow and gentle. In 
between kisses, they were breathing out their passionate best.

&quot;Oh, Daria.....oh, baby.......oh, lovergirl.......I wanna come.......!!&quot; 
said the brunette.

&quot;I.......,&quot; said the auburn, &quot;I.......am coming 
already...........OHHHHHHH!!&quot;

There&#39;s no use in asking why, 
it just turned out that way 
So meet me at midnight baby 
inside the Sad Cafe. 
Why don&#39;t you meet me at midnight baby, 
inside the Sad Cafe?

Just as they were reaching the peak of passion, the girls launched into 
the biggest and deepest kiss, before they came, their fluids gushing 
out, the two moaning deep in their kiss. After the shockwave had passed, 
they pecked each other&#39;s mouths.

&quot;Oh, Daria........&quot; breathed the brunette, &quot;I just don&#39;t care....but 
right now, I love you SO MUCH!!&quot;

&quot;Whatever,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;We&#39;ve proved to each other that life is 
&#39;bout trying new stuff. Now let&#39;s hurry.....&quot;

As soon as they could, Daria and Sandi showered, dried, dressed, packed 
up and headed for the elevator, each girl descending down in her own 
elevator. Once in the foyer, the auburn deposited her key card in the 
key drop box before picking up her bill for her stay at the desk. That 
completed, she went for the exit, while the brunette ran out a different 
door. Soon after that, the girls headed their own ways, back to their 
homes, got ready, and made to Lawndale High just in time. 

After depositing her back pack in her locker, Daria saw Jane arrive on 
the scene. &quot;You&#39;re here bright and early,&quot; said the artist. &quot;How&#39;d your 
sabbatical at The Red Barchetta Hotel do?&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t be better, Jane,&quot; replied the cynic.

&quot;Oh......so your night with Sandi was great, wasn&#39;t it? &quot;

Jumping back as if she had been stung, Daria gasped, &quot;WHAT?!?&quot;

&quot;Take it easy,&quot; said Jane, holding up her hand and laughing. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t 
abandon my partner in crime. I mean, Tom was one thing, but.......we&#39;re 
STILL freakin&#39; friends.&quot; Then bursting into wild laughter, she added, 
&quot;You and Sandi, the F.C. President, gettin&#39; jiggy with it?!? How&#39;s that 
for a page of Lawndale history?&quot;

&quot;Just as long as neither Brittany, nor Kevin, nor Upchuck, nor anyone 
else get wind of it,&quot; said the auburn meanacingly, thankful that her 
friend was still her friend.

&quot;Your secret&#39;s safe with me,&quot; said the artist, with a grin before she 
started laughing again. &quot;Remember, I had a near run in with a lezzie 
myself.&quot;

&quot;Alison....but.......,&quot; stammered Daria, &quot;how&#39;d you......?!?&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d I know?&quot; said Jane, who got herself back in control of her 
giggles. &quot;For one thing, when you stuck your pack in the locker, I could 
smell Sandi&#39;s perfume coming from it. For another, why would you choose 
a fancy joint like The Red Barchetta Hotel for your solace? Only 
clandestine lovers would choose hotels for their meetings. And that 
bribe money you used to pay for last night--why else would you resort to 
such expense? Besides, the day before last, when you came out from the 
forest after Sandi chased you, I chanced to notice your lipstick was 
smeared big time. But the real clincher was when I came to the bathroom 
last morning and overheard you and Sandi through the air vents that led 
to the roof--right up to the lip lock. &quot;

&quot;The air vents. No wonder Kevin and Brittany--&quot;

&quot;--overheard Sandi and Tiffany.&quot; Again, Jane smirked.

Sighing, Daria hung her head and said dejectedly, &quot;OK, so you know. 
PLEASE forgive me, Jane. I don&#39;t want Quinn and Tom to know. I&#39;ll be 
ruined for life.&quot;

&quot;I said it was OK,&quot; assured Jane, who placed a comforting hand on her 
friend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Only where will you two go from here?&quot;

A good question indeed--where would they go from here?

For the rest of the day, Daria knew that now that she and Sandi got what 
they came for, she could see the romance was dying out, that she was 
bored. That, plus the fact that the auburn and the brunette were of 
different worlds different lifestyles and different ways of life. Quinn 
notwithstanding, Sandi, Tiffany and Stacy (well, maybe not Stacy) hadn&#39;t 
been her friends at all, since she and her family first came to 
Lawndale. They may had been Quinn&#39;s friends but not Daria&#39;s; for that 
matter, whoever heard of a student in love with another that was a year 
below her? Especially someone that was arrogant, stuck up, egotistical 
and self centered. But then, Sandi was only that way because of her mom 
Linda. 

There were also reputations to protect, Daria with her cynicism and 
Sandi with her hyper bitch ways. And yet the irony was for their 
differences, the auburn and the brunette WERE united by one common 
thing--Quinn. Sister, best friend, and at the same time, some one to 
fight with.

And then there was one problem: how to break up with Sandi. Knowing the 
diva&#39;s fierce temper, and her tears, the cynic was torn. Should she risk 
breaking Sandi&#39;s heart and get hurt, or be stuck in a joyless love 
affair? 

Daria had never felt so lost--and yet at the same time, so was Sandi, 
unable to decide to stop the romance or carry on. 

Plodding along Dega St. to meet up with Jane prior to eating at The 
Pizza King, all Daria could do was ponder her fate. Right now, she was 
walking past The Red Barchetta Hotel, when Amy broke into her reverie:

&quot;Daria? How&#39;s my favorite niece?&quot;

Seeing that her aunt was standing before her a yard at the entrance, the 
auburn repiled glumly, &quot;Like someone threw a monkey wrench into the 
works of the so called Ya Ya Sisterhood.&quot;

&quot;Oh, what&#39;s the matter? Did your sister pull a fashion prank on your 
black skirts?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s much worse.....would you hate me if I was in love with another 
girl?&quot;

&quot;Hate you?&quot; said Amy. &quot;My favorite niece? But what happened to Tom?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; said Daria somberly.

At that moment, an Asian accented voice said, &quot;Is that your niece you&#39;ve 
been mentioning to me?&quot;

Turning, Daria saw a business suited Japanese man with the looks of Ming 
Tsai. &quot;You Daria Morgendorffer? Permit me to introduce myself-- I am 
Eiji Tachibana, owner and general manager of The Red Barchetta Hotel. &quot;

&quot;And my aunt&#39;s new boyfriend.&quot;

&quot;Hai. Which means you&#39;re definitely her niece. It is an honor to meet 
with you, Morgendorffer san. Your aunt told me so much of your life.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised at some of the talents she&#39;s got,&quot; said Amy. &quot;Right 
now, it seems she&#39;s in a quandry.&quot;

Nodding in agreement, Eiji stated, &quot;A serious matter indeed. She seems 
rather troubled, judging from the mood she is in.&quot; To Daria, he said, 
&quot;In Japan, there is no problem that is impossible to solve. Perhaps you 
would like to stop by my office for a soda.&quot;

&quot;Knowing that I am sane,&quot; said Daria hesitantly, &quot;I guess I could stand 
a pit stop.&quot;

&quot;What I tell you?&quot; said Amy to Eiji. &quot;Daria&#39;s a card.&quot;

The interior of Eiji&#39;s office was half spartan and half in Japanese 
Shinto decor, yet was still businesslike, with a touch a homeyness--and 
it was here that Daria, sipping a soda, related to Amy and Eiji, the 
kiss she shared with Sandi, the nightmares she had, the incident in R.R. 
Tunnel No. 558, the chase the brunette gave her, the second kiss, the 
love affair she and Sandi had, and the problem of trying to break up 
with The Fashion Clubber. However, the auburn WAS careful to omit the 
fact she and the brunette made love twice, and the fact they stayed the 
night at the hotel. Indeed, to Daria&#39;s delight, Eiji turned out to be an 
understanding type, while he and Amy listened. When the cynic had 
finished, Amy said, &quot;So all that time you thought you were bi, yet your 
first love relationship&#39;s got a lot of fizz than an Ultra Cola can and 
you want out.&quot;

&quot;Like I said,&quot; said Eiji, &quot;a serious matter.&quot; Standing up, a cola can in 
hand, he paced the office. &quot;The fact you don&#39;t know how to break up from 
that girl.....I would suggest you be tactful with her and tell her the 
truth. In Japan there is a saying which is identical to your &#39;The 
squeaky wheel gets the grease&#39;--and that saying is: &#39;The nail that 
sticks up, gets pounded down.&#39; Which means you should be honest and tell 
her the romance is over.&quot;

&quot;And if I do,&quot; said the auburn, &quot;she&#39;ll scratch my eyes out. What am I 
supposed to do, say &#39;Stop it, I love it&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Sometimes, Morgendorffer san, there&#39;s risks we all must take..... what 
you Americans would call &#39;one huge explosion and get it over with&#39;, ne? 
All I can say is.....it&#39;s up to you.&quot;

&quot;Maybe the following story might help,&quot; said Amy. &quot;When I was a teen 
like you, I too, also had a lesbian love affair with a friend of mine 
with a friend of mine named Trishelle. But when the thrill was gone, I 
was worried over how to break off the relationship. So I broke it to her 
with tact, and it turned out she as the understanding type. After the 
breakup, she married a man, and gave birth to a daughter, who to 
Trishelle&#39;s surprise, also became a lesbian and went to live in some 
independent colony.&quot;

&quot;Was her daughter by any chance,&quot; asked Daria, &quot;named Alison?&quot;

Her face lighting up, Amy said, &quot;Why yes......how&#39;d you know that?&quot; &quot;She 
tried to seduce my good friend Jane some time ago.&quot;

&quot;Some things never change, eh, Daria? Like mother, like daughter.&quot;

Shaking his head in surprise, Eiji could only say, &quot;So scandal does run 
in the family. How shocking. I guess it takes all kinds.&quot;

&quot;So it would seem,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;Just another day in the sick sad 
world.&quot;

Placing aside her cola can, Amy turned to her niece, and said, &quot;So it 
would seem indeed. Anyhow, my advice is what Eiji said-- be tactful and 
break it to Sandi gently. But most important of all is: do what you 
think is right.&quot;

Poor Daria--she&#39;s now stuck between the Scylla of a controversial love 
affair and the Charibdes of breaking Sandi&#39;s heart--and upsetting her at 
the same time. Who was it that said, &quot;Don&#39;t make waves&quot;? Sometimes love 
can be dangerous. At least that didn&#39;t happen between Daria and Tom--oh 
wait, that almost jeparodized her friendship with Jane. Anyhow, our 
heroine&#39;s got a tough choice to make. And how will Sandi react? Given 
her reputation as a hyper diva, it&#39;s no hype what she might do. But then 
again....

Oh, one last thing--in case you didn&#39;t know, hai and ne?, they&#39;re 
Japanese for yes and &quot;Ain&#39;t it so?&quot; respectively. I thought you should 
know, minna san (that means all or all of you.),eh?
