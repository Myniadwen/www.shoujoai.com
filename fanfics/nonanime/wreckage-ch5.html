<h1>Avengers: Wreckage (part 5 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/wreckage-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The hotel room was seedy, almost as run down as the
rest of the neighborhood that it was in, and the
people around fit in easily. On the corners scantily
clad women waited, bored looking, while shifty looking
me called out to passerby offering various illegal
wares. It was the sort of neighborhood you might be in
when you first arrived in town broke, or the sort of
place that you could end up in after you lost it all.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jackie Lukas said flatly into her phone
from where the black haired woman sat on the rumpled
bed, &quot;I can certainly understand your position. If
another position comes up in your firm could you
contact me? I&#39;d greatly appreciate it.&quot;

Jackie turned off the phone, fighting the urge to
fling it across the room. She had been interviewing
for architectural firms all across LA, but her
criminal record and prison time seemed to make her
unemployable. They were terribly polite about it and
they never said that was the reason, but she could
read between the lines.

ring!

&quot;Yes?&quot; Jackie answered her phone grimly, wondering if
another firm was calling to tell her that they weren&#39;t
hiring her, too.

&quot;Hi Jackie,&quot; Warbird&#39;s familiar voice answered, &quot;is
this a bad time? You sound stressed.&quot;

Jackie took a breath, glad that Warbird couldn&#39;t see
the sort of dump she was staying in. &quot;It&#39;s good to
hear from you,&quot; she answered in more normal tones,
&quot;how are you?&quot;

Warbird chuckled, &quot;Not bad, all things considered. I
had my friend do those background checks we talk
about...&quot;

Jackie felt a burst of dismay. She had asked Warbird
to look into her own background as well as that of
Olivia Stane, not wanting the other heroine to be
blindsided by her criminal background. &quot;What did you
find out?&quot; she kept her voice steady.

&quot;So far Olivia Stane checks out squeaky clean,&quot;
Warbird answered, &quot;and I know about you and the
Bloodaxe thing, too.&quot; Her voice was nearly gentle as
she said, &quot;I contacted a few Avengers who were around
at the time, all of them agree you were possessed. Why
did you decide to plead guilty to reduced charges?&quot;

Jackie felt a odd mix of emotions, both shame, guilt
and relief warring within her. &quot;I guess I always
thought I could have done more to stop the weapon,&quot;
she admitted, &quot;and I felt guilty over the harm I did,
so...&quot;

&quot;I know how that feels,&quot; Warbird was sympathetic,
&quot;I&#39;ve screwed up myself more than once.&quot;

Jackie looked around her dump of a suite, her thoughts
turning to her current situation. &quot;I think I&#39;m going
to take Stane&#39;s offer,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;how about
you?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t made up my mind,&quot; Warbird admitted, &quot;but I
think I&#39;ll give it a try for awhile. If I find out
something shifty, I can always bail.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Jackie felt herself smile faintly, &quot;it&#39;ll be
nice to have someone I feel I can trust involved in
this.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;ll meet at the Stane complex and tell
Olivia,&quot; Warbird said, &quot;when do you want to go over
there?&quot;

Jackie got up, feeling a sudden surge of energy. &quot;You
busy now?&quot; she asked curiously.

Warbird chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m going to be keeping my day job,
but I think I can get away with slipping out for
awhile. See you there in half an hour?&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Jackie agreed, hanging up.

Locking her door Jackie headed up to the roof,
carefully stepping over a drunk sleeping in the
hallway. &#39;The sooner I get out of here, the better,&#39;
she thought grimly as she opened a door to the
rooftop. The crunch of crumbling roofing tiles beneath
her feet was the only sound as she drew her mace from
the bag she always carried, then with a deep breath
she slammed the handle down.

THOOM!

In a burst of lightning and a roar of thunder she
transformed, taking on a distinctly Asgardian aspect.
Blue chainmail hugged her body, black pants tucked
into golden boots while a red cloak swirled around
her. She spun her mace with the ease of long practice
and tossed, gripping the chain and being yanked into
the air.

The blue sky was obscured by smog, but up there it
still felt marvelous cutting through the air. The
magic of the Thunderstrike mace carried her out over
the city then to silicon valley, the home of much of
the best in electronic design and research. With
barely a whisper of wind she shifted course to descend
to a familiar set of buildings, a mix of
manufacturing, research and office structures.

Warbird stood by the front gate, the heroine dressed
in simple black and gold, a white stylized lightning
bolt down her chest. Her blonde hair glowed as she
smiled, the crinkling at the corner of her eyes
visible even under her simple mask. Seeing her Jackie
felt her heart beat speed up a bit, a sensation she
still couldn&#39;t quite explain.

&quot;You made good time,&quot; Warbird smiled, her teeth
flashing white.

&quot;Remind me not to race you,&quot; Thunderstrike answered as
she set down beside her, the two walking towards the
front gate.

&quot;I was nearby anyway, because of my other job,&quot;
Warbird answered dryly. They were recognized by the
guard but still underwent a security scan before being
let by.

&quot;Wonder where they got the scan data?&quot; Thunderstrike
murmured.

&quot;Probably the War Machine,&quot; Warbird answered quietly,
&quot;she did observe us in action against the Wrecking
Crew, after all.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Thunderstrike nodded as they headed to the main
offices.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; a pretty brown haired woman nodded as she
greeted them at the door, &quot;my name is Constance Leeds,
but you can just call me Connie. I&#39;ll take you up to
see Ms. Stark.&quot;

&quot;Have you been working for Stane long?&quot; Warbird asked
casually, but her eyes were intent.

&quot;Nearly a year,&quot; Connie said, cheerfully leading them
across the lobby, &quot;one of my areas of responsibility
is personnel, which is why I went to greet you.&quot;

&quot;Ms. Stane is that confident we&#39;re coming here to join
her team?&quot; Thunderstrike asked wryly as they took the
elevator up.

&quot;More hopeful, I think,&quot; Connie answered. She dropped
her voice, &quot;She really reamed out the publicity
department about issuing that press release too
early.&quot;

&quot;Press release?&quot; Thunderstrike echoed, feeling mildly
stupid.

Surprisingly Warbird answered, &quot;Stane Enterprises sent
out a notice to the papers announcing the formation of
a team, but no real details yet.&quot;

Connie blinked, looking at Warbird as she asked, &quot;Do
you have friends in the media?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Warbird smiled faintly.

They headed out of the elevator and up a short
hallway, leading into the main office. Olivia Stane
was standing by her desk, smiling slightly while
nearby Jennifer Swensen looked out the window, the
redhead&#39;s foot tapping nervously.

&quot;Have you had time to consider my offer?&quot; Olivia
asked, pushing a strand of white-blonde hair back from
her face.

&quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; Thunderstrike nodded, her hand tightening a
bit nervously on her mace. This was a big step on
multiple levels, and she prayed she was ready for it.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Warbird nodded, &quot;if only to keep T-strike
here company.&quot;

&quot;Then welcome aboard,&quot; Jennifer grinned, moving
forward to shake both their hands with a surprising
degree of enthusiasm, &quot;as we&#39;ll be working together,
call me Jen.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve decided to join us,&quot; Olivia agreed.
She gave Connie a grin, &quot;We&#39;ll get the paper work out
of the way, then start talking organization.&quot;

Connie looked hesitantly at the two of them, &quot;How
would you like to be paid? If it&#39;s cheque or direct
deposit I&#39;ll need a name or account number...&quot;

Thunderstrike raised her mace and gently struck the
floor, transforming once again into Jackie Lukas. &quot;I&#39;m
pretty sure Ms. Stane has my name already,&quot; Jackie
felt a bit ashamed at needing the pay, &quot;and I wouldn&#39;t
object to being listed as a company employee.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll put you down as a special consultant,&quot; Connie
pulled out a hand held computer and began typing away
as she added, &quot;you&#39;ll get a signing bonus along with
standard wages.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need special treatment,&quot; Jackie started.

&quot;It&#39;s not special,&quot; Olivia said firmly, &quot;I try to keep
my people happy, and the signing bonus fits with your
architectural qualifications, too.&quot;

&#39;Wonder if they really need an architect?&#39; Jackie
thought, but wisely decided not to argue. She could
put the bonus to working getting out of her dive of a
suite.

&quot;Miss Warbird?&quot; Connie looked at her seriously.


Warbird chuckled, &quot;Half a second.&quot; With that she
flared golden a moment, her costume replaced by street
clothes, a nice if off the rack business suit. &quot;Carol
Danvers,&quot; she introduced herself with a smile.

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Jackie said, faintly surprised to
see she looked as good in regular clothes as she did
in costume. &#39;Where did that thought come from?&#39; Jackie
thought, surprised.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Carol&#39;s smile widened.
