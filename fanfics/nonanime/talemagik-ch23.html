<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>Later that night the tent was quiet as they settled
down for bed, Illyanna generating a small sphere of
light to illuminate their temporary quarters. The
blonde laid out the two sleeping bags that the Weird
Happenings Organization had also leant them, zipping
them together into a larger bed.

&quot;We&#39;re going to need a good night&#39;s sleep,&quot; Kitty
noted, her gaze lingering as she watched Illyanna
strip, revealing firm breasts and a flat belly. The
brown haired woman removed her own clothes, for a
moment wishing she had slightly larger breasts.
&#39;Still, Illyanna seems to be happy with what I&#39;ve
got,&#39; she thought happily.

Illyanna smiled, eyes twinkling as she climbed into
bed beside Kitty, &quot;I know something that makes you
sleep like a baby.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Kitty squeaked as a hand squeezed gently. &quot;The
others&#39; tents aren&#39;t so far from us, you know,&quot; she
reminded Illyanna a bit breathlessly.

&quot;Then we&#39;ll just have to see how quiet you can be,&quot;
Illyanna purred wickedly.

In a nearby tent Colonel Alysande Stuart had to fight
back a chuckle at the various noises that she was
hearing. The brown haired officer looked much less
formal undressed and reading a book by battery-powered
lamp, munching some crackers absentmindedly.

&#39;Those two aren&#39;t quite what I was expecting from the
sorcerer supreme,&#39; Alysande mused, though in all
honesty she was reasonably impressed with them so far.
Both young ladies had shown considerable skill, and
even though she had needed to suggest a solution to a
problem, they used it without a sign of resentment.

&quot;Are you awake?&quot; the quiet voice came from outside.

Alysande blinked in surprise, for a moment considering
hiding her snacks then stopped herself firmly. &quot;Come
in,&quot; she called, having a good guess who it was.

The Phoenix pushed the flap of the tent aside, the
redhead kneeling slightly as she came inside. The
borrowed nightclothes were a bit snug, the shirt tight
across her bust and pants hugging her hips. &quot;Sorry to
bother you,&quot; Jean said simply.

Alysande smiled at the other woman curiously, &quot;May I
ask why you&#39;re visiting?&quot;

Jean gave her a wry smile, &quot;It seems that Rachel
snores, and since we&#39;re sharing a tent....&quot;

With a chuckle Alysande noted, &quot;And it&#39;s not like you
can stay with my brother.&quot;

A particularly loud moan reminded them of the two
young ladies nearby. &quot;Or Kitty and Illyanna,&quot; Jean
agreed with some amusement.

&quot;Were they that enthusiastic back in the states?&quot;
Alysande asked Jean curiously.

Jean chuckled softly, &quot;Well, yes.&quot;

Alysande studied the redhead a moment then gestured
beside her, &quot;You&#39;re welcome to share my tent for the
night, then.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jean flashed a smile, &quot;I doubt I&#39;ll get much
sleep otherwise.&quot; Rather uncomfortably Jean lay beside
Alysande on the sleeping bag, giving the other woman a
sheepish smile as she accidentally brushed her body
with her breasts, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

Fighting back a blush Alysande gruffly said to Jean,
&quot;See you in the morning.&quot; She shut her lamp off and
snuggled down, doing her best not to think about the
woman who was now sleeping so close beside her.

The morning found them standing out by the circle of
standing stones, the mystic lightning dancing from
stone to stone. Floating before them were the astral
images of the allied sorcerers, each garbed as they
usually were for casting magics.

&quot;All right,&quot; Kitty said to all of them seriously,
&quot;we&#39;re going to do this in two steps. The first thing
we&#39;re going to do is erect the layered protective
shields, and only then will we attempt to exorcise the
anti-Phoenix.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for your help, everyone,&quot; Illyanna
addressed the ghostly forms, &quot;together we should be
able to pull this off.&quot;

The elderly sorceress Agatha Harkness began the
enchantment, her years of experience providing an
foundation for the spell. Dr. Anthony Druid and Albion
brought the olde magics of Britain into the network,
then Shaman called upon the elemental spirits of the
Earth to help them. Finally the youngest stepped
forward, Jennifer Kale and the Scarlet Witch bringing
youthful power and vigor to the structure.

Agatha Harkness frowned, her face wrinkled with age
and experience. &quot;It&#39;s done,&quot; she said, &quot;but there&#39;s
only so long a spell this complex can be maintained.&quot;

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Allistaire murmured, the young scientist
eagerly monitoring the goings on. Technicians from WHO
were scattered about at different equipment stations,
each one recording valuable types of data.

&quot;We&#39;re up, love,&quot; Illyanna murmured.

&quot;Wish me luck,&quot; Kitty answered, stepping nearer to the
circle as she brought her hands up to the amulet she
wore. She concentrated and it gently irised open, a
shining bolt of light sweeping down into the earth.

Rachel braced herself, then the young redhead puffed a
breath out in relief. The last time Kitty tried this
something from below zapped her immediately, but now
she seemed to be all right. &quot;So far so good,&quot; she
murmured.

Illyanna ignited her Soulsword, the mystic blade
burning brightly as she prepared herself to act.
&quot;What&#39;s down there?&quot; she asked Kitty softly.

&quot;A corpse,&quot; Kitty sounded almost ill as she explained,
&quot;it looks like someone took the Phoenix fragment and
stuffed in inside along with magical energies and
tainted life force. It&#39;s almost like some corrupt
perversion of a womb....&quot;

&quot;So how do we handle this?&quot; Alysande asked crisply,
unconsciously hefting as rifle. It wouldn&#39;t do much
good if the anti-Phoenix attacked but she felt better
having it, anyway.

&quot;I think we&#39;re going to have to wreck your historic
site,&quot; Illyanna said grimly.

&quot;Do what you have to,&quot; Allistaire said seriously, &quot;WHO
is given a pretty big latitude by the ministry,
anyway.&quot;

Alysande felt herself smile, &quot;Besides, we can always
blame it on rampaging Americans.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Kitty agreed with a laugh. She gestured
towards the ground, her eyes narrowed the she bit out
certain almost unpronounceable words.

Things were silent for a moment, then there was a
distant rumbling. The earth vibrated, gently at first,
then stronger and stronger. Finally with a mighty
heave the ground split apart above the stone circle
even as it spat up a long, squarish object that was
inscribed with the same sort of runic pattern as the
ring of standing stones were.

&quot;It&#39;s awake...&quot; Jennifer Kale cried out in alarm, the
young blonde haired woman wincing as if she had been
struck.

The stone box shook, cracks appearing in it&#39;s surface
then it simply exploded to reveal the figure within.
The corpse was rotten, green, and the Phoenix flames
that danced around it were sickly and tainted much the
same. It shuddered, moving jerkily, almost as if it
was confused, bewildered by it&#39;s surroundings.

Kitty&#39;s amulet flared brightly, her words shaping
those energies into a spell of containment. Shining
rings held the anti-Phoenix captive, but even the
power of a sorceress supreme couldn&#39;t hold it for
long. Thankfully, it didn&#39;t have to.

&quot;Illyanna, NOW!&quot; Kitty cried.

On cue Illyanna leapt, sweeping her Soulsword across
the form of the anti-Phoenix even as the circle of
wizards focused their energies to shield them all. The
disruptive powers of the Soulsword mixed with the
twisted forces of the anti-Phoenix and combusted, a
massive explosion blasting apart the archeological
sight with immense power.

When the blast cleared the corpse and the anti-phoenix
were gone, only leaving one thing behind. Dancing in
the air the tiny bird of fire flew, a baby Phoenix
risen from the ashes, purified by their combined
powers. It soared towards Jean and settled into her
outreached hand, shining in the morning sun.

&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Rachel blinked.

&quot;Very nearly,&quot; Jean looked down fondly at the
Phoenix-child, &quot;but I... don&#39;t know if I want to
reabsorb her. It had struggled hard to live, it seems
a waste to do that now.&quot;

&quot;I think I may have an idea,&quot; Illyanna sighed tiredly.
As everyone looked at her she shrugged, &quot;Rachel seems
to be the Phoenix heir anyway, so why not give the
baby to her?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not ready for....&quot; Rachel stammered.

&quot;It shouldn&#39;t be too powerful just yet,&quot; Kitty noted
thoughtfully as she continued, &quot;it would grow in power
over time.&quot;

&quot;And I can&#39;t think of a better guardian to it,&quot; Jean
added warmly.

Rachel hesitated, then finally a smile teased her
lips. &quot;If all of you are sure, I&#39;ll do it,&quot; she said.
With that Jean released the baby-Phoenix and it soared
to Rachel, hovering above her before seemingly
disappearing within her. &quot;I don&#39;t feel any different,&quot;
Rachel blinked.

&quot;Give it time,&quot; Jean chuckled.</pre>
