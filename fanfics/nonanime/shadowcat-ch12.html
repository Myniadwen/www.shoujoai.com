<h1>Shadowcat: Read or Die! (part 12 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/shadowcat-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>        The slim blonde haired man studied the documents that were laid 
out before him on the messy desk, a frown on his delicately handsome 
face. There was a soft knock on the door and Joker looked up to call 
out, &quot;Come in.&quot;

        Drake Anderson strode inside, the burly man closing the door 
behind him. His short blonde hair fell into his blue eyes, ones that 
were focused on Joker as he asked, &quot;You wanted to see me?&quot;

        &#39;It was odd,&#39; Joker noted, &#39;how such a large man could move so 
gracefully, not tipping any of the piles of books and papers around the 
cluttered office.&#39; He set the sheets aside as he said, &quot;I wanted to know 
what you thought of Miss Pryde.&quot;

        &quot;You thinking of recruiting her?&quot; Drake asked directly, his 
T-shirt and jeans making him stand out in the old English styled room.

        &quot;Yes I am,&quot; Joker calmly admitted, &quot;though I suppose it does 
depend on how this &#39;Ogun situation resolves itself.&quot;

        &quot;I like her,&quot; Drake admitted, &quot;but I&#39;m not sure I trust her yet. 
She was the genetic basis for Nancy and we both know how untrustworthy 
she could be.&quot;

        &quot;There is always the question of nature versus nurture,&quot; Joker 
quietly noted, &quot;Nancy was raised, if you want to call it that, by Ikyu 
and the Ijin.&quot; He sighed, &quot;Not at all under the same sort of conditions 
that Miss Pryde was.&quot;

        &quot;Yeah, maybe,&quot; Drake obviously wasn&#39;t entirely convinced. He 
smiled slightly, &quot;But I do think Pryde&#39;s been straight with us so far.&quot;

        Joker nodded. &quot;Keep an eye on her, of course,&quot; he said as he 
tucked sheets of paper away, &quot;but we will be considering making her the 
offer.&quot;

        &quot;You got it,&quot; and with that Drake slipped out of the office.

        A few moments later there was a quiet knock and Wendy stuck her 
head in. &quot;Did you talk to Drake about it?&quot; the pretty blonde asked him 
curiously.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Joker smiled slightly as he continued dryly, &quot;as I&#39;m sure 
you know, having been pressing your ear to the door.&quot;

        &quot;How could you tell...?&quot; Wendy blurted.

        &quot;The hair on one side of your head was flattened slightly,&quot; 
Joker shrugged casually. &quot;And do you approve of Miss Pryde&#39;s addition to 
our ranks?&quot;

        &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; Wendy nodded, holding a set of files in front of 
her casually. &quot;She works well with both Yomiko and Drake and she brings 
us unique skills and experiences.&quot;

        &quot;The only thing that concerns me is Pryde&#39;s connections to the 
international intelligence community,&quot; Joker said with a frown as he 
tapped a document, &quot;she&#39;s been involved with Britain&#39;s Weird Happenings 
Organization before.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Wendy blinked.

        &quot;No, W.H.O. ,&quot; Joker smiled slightly as Wendy groaned. &quot;She&#39;s 
tangled with Black Air,&quot; he tapped a sheet, &quot;and even joined SHIELD for 
a short time.&quot;

        &quot;Something we could use to our advantage,&quot; Wendy offered 
optimistically.

        &quot;That we could,&quot; Joker agreed. He slid the sheets together into 
a file labeled &#39;Pryde, Katherine&#39; and passed it to her, &quot;Could you put 
this back and get me some tea?&quot;

        &quot;Yes, sir!&quot; Wendy beamed, spinning around to leave the room, 
nearly tripping over the doorway as she left.

        &quot;She never changes,&quot; Joker shook his head with a smile as he 
returned to his work.

        &quot;No, she doesn&#39;t,&quot; the older man&#39;s voice echoed in the chamber, 
filled with gentle amusement

        Joker didn&#39;t exactly jump but his eyes widened slightly as he 
looked up. &quot;Mr. Gentleman,&quot; he said respectfully.

        &quot;We may have a problem,&quot; Mr. Gentleman said, &quot;something 
dangerous has turned up in my search for information on &#39;Ogun.&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Joker asked, his eyes narrowing again.

        &quot;You may recall the attempt on my life over ten years ago,&quot; 
Gentleman continued, &quot;the assassin whom escaped our best security. After 
reviewing the data Miss Pryde provided I feel certain that he was in 
fact &#39;Ogun.&quot;

        Joker sat back with a frown as he mused, &quot;Then our own 
organization&#39;s involvement in this situation merely grows deeper. For 
our own honor as well as to find the answers to Nancy&#39;s existence we 
must stop &#39;Ogun and his allies.&quot;

        &quot;Well isn&#39;t that just great,&quot; Drake muttered as the briefing 
concluded, leaning up against the back of a well stuffed chair.

        Yomiko Readman and Kitty Pryde sat in a couch nearby, the two 
young women sitting side by side. Kitty was wearing her new uniform, the 
simulated black leather clinging to the brown haired woman&#39;s slim body 
while Yomiko wore her overcoat over her typical school teachers clothes.

        Yomiko shook her head slightly as she murmured, &quot;Well, &#39;Ogun 
certainly was busy.&quot;

        &quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Kitty muttered before continuing, &quot;I keep 
forgetting how old he&#39;s supposed to be, how long he&#39;s been operating.&quot;

        &quot;Not that it changes our current situation much,&quot; Drake reminded 
them, &quot;it just gives us one more reason to take him down.&quot;

        &quot;There is one piece of good news,&quot; Joker said smoothly, turning 
the screen in front of the group, &quot;we&#39;ve had some luck tracing the 
original Nancy&#39;s movements and tentatively concluded that she first 
appeared here in Japan.&quot;

        &quot;So Sinister-san is here in Japan?&quot; Yomiko offered the question 
quietly.

        &quot;Let&#39;s not jump to that conclusion just yet,&quot; Kitty said softly, 
&quot;we just know that he has a operational base here, but it&#39;s pretty 
likely.&quot; She looked thoughtful as she looked up at Joker, &quot;What sort of 
sources of information do you have in Japan?&quot;

        &quot;Fairly wide ranging, why?&quot; Joker looked curious.

        &quot;I have some contacts in the Japanese underworld,&quot; Kitty said 
frankly, &quot;with &#39;Ogun&#39;s long history as an assassin they might know 
something.&quot;

        Drake raised an eyebrow as he smiled down at Kitty, &quot;You 
certainly have some unusual friends for a university student.&quot;

        Kitty shrugged eloquently, &quot;Not that unusual for an X-man, 
though.&quot;

        &quot;Just like the detective in the novel I just read,&quot; Yomiko 
gushed. Her eyes brightened and she asked, &quot;Can I come along?&quot;

        &quot;It might be dangerous,&quot; Kitty quickly cautioned, &quot;and least one 
of the people I mean to talk to is not a nice man.&quot;

        &quot;All the more reason to have back-up,&quot; Drake offered, clearly 
interested in coming along.

        Kitty looked at the both of them and shook her head with a smile 
as she said, &quot;As long as Joker doesn&#39;t mind, all right.&quot;

        &quot;May I ask whom you intend to go see?&quot; Joker asked.

        &quot;An old ally named Yukio,&quot; Kitty said, &quot;she&#39;s a self-styled 
ronin and adventurer who&#39;s helped the X-Men in the past, she might be 
able to help. Then I guess we&#39;ll go see the Yashada family.&quot;

        &quot;The Yashada family?&quot; Drake actually looked mildly startled, 
&quot;They&#39;re not connected to the underworld, they run much of it.&quot;

        &quot;Especially with their current leader, the Silver Samurai,&quot; 
Kitty said with a tight little smile, &quot;but I think I know which buttons 
to push to get answers from him.&quot;

        Joker nodded slightly, &quot;I rather doubt we could get information 
from such sources normally.&quot; He looked at the three, &quot;You have 
permission, but please be careful.&quot;

        Kitty looked over at the beaming Yomiko and the not much less 
eager Drake and smiled wryly. &quot;I&#39;ll try to keep an eye on them,&quot; she 
said as she got up.

        &quot;Kitty,&quot; Yomiko scolded as the two ladies got up.

        &quot;More like I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on you two,&quot; Drake commented 
as they headed out.

        &quot;You wish,&quot; Kitty grinned.

To be continued....

Author&#39;s Notes: Kitty did indeed join the international spy organization 
SHIELD in a three issue miniseries and ran into the Weird Happenings 
Organization often in the series Excalibur. Later the covert 
organization Black Air was introduced, leading to more spy activities by 
Kitty.</pre>
