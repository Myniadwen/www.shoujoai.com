<h1>The Date (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Introduction: This is set during the final 20 issue period of the 
original Gen 13 series before DC tried to restart the title without the 
original cast. I&#39;ll try to explain references from the series in the 
story, but if I need to I&#39;ll include some information in the author&#39;s 
note afterwards. As my regular readers will expect this story has 
girl/girl romance, if you don&#39;t like that don&#39;t continue reading.

------------------------------------------------------------

Kaitlin Fairchild ran with an easy motion, her golden brown long hair 
flowing past her shoulders as she pounded down the rough trail. The 
California sun shone down, the air remarkably clear as she took deep 
breaths, her shorts and top revealing tanned skin.

&#39;This solo camping trip was a great idea,&#39; Kaitlin thought as she 
returned to her campsite at a gentle walk, &#39;I really needed to get away 
from everyone for awhile.&#39;

As the semi-official leader of Gen 13 Kaitlin had responsibilities, most 
of which she had to admit were self imposed. With Mr. Lynch gone and 
without an adult mentor her sister Roxy, Grunge, Bobby and Sarah were 
more likely to get into trouble, something Kaitlin did her best to watch 
out for. That kind of never ending vigilance was tiring, though, and 
when their robot maid Anna suggested this vacation she had leapt at the 
chance.

&#39;Peace and quiet at last,&#39; Kaitlin thought before a low rumble echoed 
through the forest. Her eyes narrowed as she recognized it, the sound of 
a mini-jet of some kind. She quietly made her way to the ridge just 
beyond her tent and froze, the woman standing there instantly familiar.

Kaitlin strode from her cover as she grimly asked, &quot;What are you doing 
here?&quot;

&quot;Is that anyway to greet a friend?&quot; the black haired older woman asked 
as she looked around the camp. &quot;So charmingly... rustic,&quot; she used a 
leather booted foot to nudge the log that Kaitlin had been using to sit 
on earlier, one that matched the bodysuit she wore.

&quot;You&#39;re not a friend Ivana,&quot; Kaitlin answered dryly as she walked 
towards her.

&quot;Then it&#39;s a poor was to treat someone whom you owe a... favor?&quot; Ivana 
said with a smirk, looking Kaitlin over possesively.

Kaitlin felt herself flush with embarrassment under her knowing gaze 
even as she silently cursed her own foolishness. A few months ago her 
powers had faded away, leaving herself and her teammates in danger. 
Deciding her needed to regain those powers she went to the woman who had 
helped them gain their abilities. Ivana Baul had agreed to restore 
Kaitlin but had demanded that she return the favor at a time and place 
of her own choosing.

&#39;I guess this is it,&#39; Kaitlin thought glumly. &quot;What do you want?&quot; she 
asked firmly, almost knowing that she&#39;ll regret it.

&quot;It&#39;s time for you to keep up your end of our little bargain,&quot; Ivana 
confirmed with a smirk, &quot;I need your assistance with a little undercover 
operation.&quot;

Kaitlin sighed to herself softly, shaking her head. &quot;Well, let&#39;s go get 
this over with,&quot; she muttered resentfully, quickly looking over her 
camping gear and deciding that it should be fine on it&#39;s own. &#39;I hope,&#39; 
she thought.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Ivana ordered crisply as she lead the way to the jet, 
&quot;there&#39;s limited time and we need to get you dressed properly.&quot;

&quot;Great,&quot; Kaitlin muttered under her breath as she followed Ivana in, 
wondering for a moment how someone could get into such a tight leather 
costume. &#39;Then again I do wear spandex,&#39; she thought with a self-mocking 
smile.

&quot;Here, change into this&quot; Ivana passed Kaitlin a bundle of clothes even 
as she turned to instruct the pilot, &quot;let&#39;s go.&quot;

Kaitlin looked around, &quot;Where do I dress?&quot;

Ivana raised an eyebrow even as she smiled. &quot;It&#39;s just us women here, 
dear,&quot; she murmured, keeping her eyes on her.

Kaitlin grit her teeth at that comment but quickly began peeling off her 
sweaty clothes. &quot;Then is there at least someplace I can shower this off, 
first?&quot; she asked, her T-shirt and shorts dropping to the floor to 
reveal a body shining with a sheen of sweat.

It took Ivana a moment to answer her, almost as if she was mildly 
distracted by something. &quot;I suppose we can manage that,&quot; she agreed and 
with a press of a button a cubicle shower opened up in the back of the 
passenger compartment.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kaitlin stripped her bra and panties off and left them with 
the other clothes. As Kaitlin walked to the shower she could almost feel 
Ivana&#39;s eyes on her, watching her. She showered quickly, heated air 
blowing on her body to try her, then emerged nude to get changed. 
&quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; she nodded to Ivana, grabbing the clothes to cover 
herself.

Ivana had a slight flush to her pale skin but she smiled as she said, 
&quot;The clothes should fit, I have all your measurements from when I worked 
on you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for reminding me,&quot; Kaitlin muttered.

The delicate looking panties slid up her long bare legs, then she took 
the matching bra and pulled it on. The blue dress pants were loose but a 
stylish leather belt was there for the waist, the white button up shirt 
she wore loose and comfortable. Over that she pulled a coat that matched 
the pants, left flapping open for comfort.

&quot;Very butch,&quot; Ivana smirked, &quot;I thought it would suit you.&quot;

Kaitlin looked down at her clothes a moment before admitting, &quot;Knowing 
you I was almost expecting black leather.&quot;

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t have fit where we&#39;re going,&quot; Ivana answered her calmly as 
she passed over white socks and black dress shoes along with a black 
hair clip. She gave Kaitlin a sultry smile as she added, &quot;But if you 
like I could always arrange something later....&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Kaitlin quickly shook her head, taking a seat as she pulled on 
the shoes. &quot;So what&#39;s the mission?&quot; she asked, tying her hair back into 
a simple ponytail.

&quot;You&#39;ll find out,&quot; Ivana said simply. She got up out of her own chair 
and then she calmly unzipped her black leather bodysuit, wiggling slim 
her hips a bit as she slid out of the skin tight outfit and let it drop 
to the floor.

&quot;What are you going...?&quot; Kaitlin squeaked out, instantly noticing that 
Ivana was completely nude underneath. She wanted to look away but 
somehow her eyes were drawn to Ivana&#39;s body, to the slim but gorgeous 
looking woman.

Ivana noticed her reaction of course, the impish little smile on her 
face. &quot;The leather wasn&#39;t quite appropriate,&quot; she answered Kaitlin quite 
calmly, stepping into a long red dress and pulling it up. She reached 
around to try and do it up then frowned, not quite able to reach the 
clasp. &quot;Kaitlin, could you...?&quot; she asked her softly.

Kaitlin got up, moving behind Ivana to quickly pull the zipper up. There 
was a delicate scent around Ivana, a perfume that teased at her nose. 
&quot;Why are we dressed like this,&quot; she asked, &quot;does it have something to do 
with the mission?&quot;

The pilot&#39;s voice came through the cabin as she announced, &quot;We&#39;ll be 
arriving at the target in less than one minute.&quot;

Ivana put glittering earrings on then sat down, slipping her high heels 
on with the ease of long practice. &quot;I have a meeting with certain 
dangerous people,&quot; she said simply, &quot;I need a bodyguard and date, one 
whom can get me out of a situation if one should arise.&quot; Ivana flashed 
Kaitlin a smile, &quot;Naturally I thought of you.&quot;

&quot;Naturally,&quot; Kaitlin echoed.

There was a soft thump as the plane landed, a second later the back 
hatch opening to reveal a large curling driveway. A mansion stood off in 
the distance, column&#39;s lining the front and windows glowing with merry 
life. The green lawn stretched out around it, larger than most football 
fields.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Kaitlin managed weakly.

Addressing the pilot Ivana said, &quot;I&#39;ll signal you in two hours to let 
you know if we need to be picked up.&quot; She turned to Kaitlin, &quot;Well, 
let&#39;s go.&quot;

Kaitlin offered Ivana her arm, the two stepping out of the plane and 
onto the pavement. As they walked towards the house she murmured, &quot;I 
assume I&#39;m to lead?&quot;

&quot;Very good,&quot; Ivana said with a smile, &quot;you took your cue from our 
clothes.&quot;

Young men and women were scattered around the busy lane, taking people&#39;s 
cars and driving them into spots, leading people inside and generally 
attending to the guests needs. Kaitlin noted the attentive eyes of the 
many servants, spotting the occasional bulge of concealed weapons and 
softly murmured, &quot;Security team?&quot;

&quot;The customers pay for privacy,&quot; Ivana smiled and nodded to other guests 
as they walked up carpeted steps to a front archway, &quot;and they also 
guarantee the neutrality of this place.&quot;

&quot;Welcome,&quot; a slight nod and the black suited pretty young man opened the 
door for them with a gesture, &quot;Ms. Baul, Miss Fairchild.&quot; The hallway 
was lit by golden light, the carpet thick under their feet as they 
walked.

Kaitlin shivered as a odd sensation skittered across her skin. &quot;Security 
scan,&quot; she murmured before whispering, &quot;how did he know our names?&quot;

&quot;She,&quot; Ivana corrected with a little smile as they reached the second 
door, &quot;probably used the exterior security cameras and a database 
search.&quot;

&quot;Should have thought of that,&quot; Kaitlin sighed.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; the handsome young woman waiting at that door nodded to them. 
She touched a tiny earpiece, &quot;You scan clean of weapons but we&#39;re aware 
of both Ivana&#39;s cybernetic enhancements and Kaitlin&#39;s Gen-factor 
abilities, ladies. Any trouble that you cause will be grounds for 
immediate expulsion, by force if needed.&quot;

&quot;I have been here before,&quot; Ivana answered her mildly, &quot;I know the 
rules.&quot;

The woman looked at Kaitlin thoughtfully and she realized she was 
expecting a response. &quot;I understand,&quot; Kaitlin answered, &quot;but if anyone 
takes a shot at Ivana I will stop them.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; the door woman nodded slightly, swinging the door open. 
&quot;Have a good evening,&quot; she said with a smile.

&quot;I think she liked hearing that,&quot; Ivana said with a smile.

Kaitlin felt her cheeks redden but she wasn&#39;t quite sure how to respond. 
They entered the club itself and her eyes widened noticeably. Women 
packed the place, beautiful ladies dressed in every fashion imaginable, 
talking, dancing close and clearly showing their affection for each 
other.

&quot;You&#39;re staring,&quot; Ivana murmured, sounding quite amused.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Kaitlin got herself moving once again. &quot;I think I&#39;ve heard of a 
club like this in Japan...&quot; she murmured thoughtfully.

&quot;I understand this club was modeled after it,&quot; Ivana noted. A woman 
slinked through the crowd and she murmured, &quot;Maybe I could have worn the 
leather.&quot;

Kaitlin gazed in shock at the leather clad woman, she had thought that 
Ivana&#39;s outfit had been racy but this... The woman had zippers placed 
over her breasts and groin, buckles and belts binding her into the 
costume. A matching hood covered the top of her face but her red lips 
glowed in the light, a tongue slipping out to lick them.

&quot;This place is going to be an education for me, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Kaitlin 
muttered as she went by.

Ivana just chuckled wickedly.</pre>
