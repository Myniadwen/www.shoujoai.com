<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>Tara smiled to herself grimly as the brown haired
women finished her work, her thoughts whirling about
restlessly. Dressed in a casual style with a leather
jacket, jeans and blouse she looked like any other
woman in the Bronze, but beneath the surface she was
far, far different.

&quot;Well,&quot; the faintly accented voice said, &quot;you&#39;ve been
looking for me, I hear.&quot;

&quot;Doyle,&quot; Tara looked up, flashing a faint smile.

The black haired man was thin, almost tired looking
as he walked up, but his smile was honestly friendly.
&quot;Been awhile, Tara,&quot; he said, his Irish accent
thickening a bit.

&quot;Too long,&quot; Tara took his hand and shook it. Dropping
her voice a bit as she led him up to the bar she
asked, &quot;Are you still in LA?&quot;

&quot;Ya, along with Angel&#39;s crew,&quot; Doyle admitted,
&quot;mighty big shoes to fill but I&#39;m doing my best at
it.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Tara admitted, thinking of the
things she had heard about the ensouled vampire before
his final death.

&quot;I&#39;m lucky I have Gunn,&quot; Doyle mused, &quot;along with
Caridad, Fred and the others Angel trained.&quot; He shook
himself, &quot;But enough about all that, you wouldn&#39;t have
called me up without a good reason.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tara sighed, pouring them both beers. Passing
him one she said, &quot;You remember Amy, right?&quot;

&quot;Nice kid,&quot; Doyle agreed, &quot;I was sorry when I
heard....&quot;

&quot;Well, she&#39;s not a nice kid any more,&quot; Tara took a
drink, &quot;she&#39;s a vampire.&quot;

&quot;Crap,&quot; Doyle murmured softly, closing his eyes. He
took a slug of his beer then asked, &quot;Has anyone
managed to stake her?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Tara shook her head bleakly, &quot;we can&#39;t even
find her. Do you think your visions could help us?&quot;

Doyle swirled the beer around in his glass
uncomfortably. &quot;If I haven&#39;t had a vision yet,&quot; he
confessed, &quot;I&#39;m probably not going to. The Powers send
the visions for their own reasons, not ones we usually
understand.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Tara sighed.

&quot;I can put the word out through my contacts,&quot; Doyle
offered gently, &quot;if anyone in Sunnydale is doing
business with the baddies in LA, I can find out.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Tara made herself smile, &quot;and maybe we
can borrow some muscle later, if we need it?&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Doyle smiled as he patted her hand, &quot;call, and
we&#39;ll come running.&quot;

Just then the door to the Bronze crashed open, two
struggling figures falling to the clean floor as they
struggled hard. &quot;Oh hell,&quot; Tara growled, moving to
stop them then blinking as she realized both seemed
human and one was her girlfriend.

&quot;Hi honey,&quot; Faith managed as she head butted, the
other woman, &quot;sorry I&#39;m late.&quot;

&quot;Damn it Gwen,&quot; Doyle burst out, his accent
thickening with anger and surprise,&quot;wha&#39; the &#39;ell are
you doin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;You know her?&quot; Faith blinked, relaxing her hold on
the other woman.

The black haired young woman also stopped struggling,
blinking a bit sheepishly. &quot;You know her, boss?&quot; Gwen
asked.

&quot;Yes I know her,&quot; Doyle growled, &quot;she&#39;s the Slayer,
damn it!&quot;

Gwen instantly released her grip on Faith and gave
her a weak smile, &quot;Ooops?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Tara asked as she offered Faith a
hand up.

&quot;I saw little miss leather here,&quot; Faith gestured,
&quot;hanging out outside the bar, and figured she was up
to no good.&quot;

&quot;The name is Gwen Raiden,&quot; she said frostily, &quot;and I
was keeping a eye on the place in case this was some
kind of trap for Doyle.&quot; She sniffed, &quot;Wolfram and
Hart would love to capture or kill a link to the
Powers that Be,&quot;

&quot;Raiden?&quot; Faith sniffed, &quot;tell me you were born with
that name, babe.&quot;

Gwen glared at her, &quot;None of your business.&quot;

All around them the bar continued it&#39;s business, one
of the waitresses up behind the bar filling in. If you
lived in Sunnydale any period of time you got used to
a certain degree of oddness, and two sexy ladies cat
fighting barely made anyone bat an eye.

&quot;Play nice,&quot; Doyle said, his eyes flaring a bit as he
fought to control his demon side. Gentling his tone he
looked at Tara, &quot;Sorry for my partner&#39;s over
enthusiasm. She&#39;s usually better house broken than
this.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Gwen protested.

&quot;Well, Faith could have asked rather than jump her,&quot;
Tara conceded, &quot;so I figure we&#39;re pretty much even.&quot;

&quot;Humph,&quot; Faith pouted a bit.

&quot;It&#39;s been good to see you,&quot; Doyle shook Tara&#39;s hand,
&quot;and if I do hear of anything, I&#39;ll let you know
soonest.&quot;

&quot;And if there&#39;s anything I or the coven can do, let
us know,&quot; Tara promised.

After the two left Faith smiled wryly at Tara,
&quot;Forgive me for embarrassing you in front of your
friend?&quot;

Tara chuckled softly, &quot;It&#39;s all right, love.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Faith asked as they headed up to the bar, &quot;who
is he?&quot;

&quot;Allen Doyle,&quot; Tara said as they sat down on the bar
stools, &quot;he&#39;s a seer, a half demon who&#39;s been granted
visions of the future by the Powers that Be.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Faith blinked as she signaled for a drink and
a refill for Tara.

&quot;Before Angel came to Sunnydale to face the Master
they worked together,&quot; Tara said, &quot;organizing a LA
band of monster fighters that&#39;s still going strong.
The Coven here has helped them at times too.&quot;

&quot;Which explains how you know him,&quot; Faith agreed. She
looked at Tara with a sad smile, &quot;Please don&#39;t do
anything without telling me, please?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Tara promised, &quot;but if I get a shot at
finding Amy and no one&#39;s around, I may have to go for
it.&quot;

&quot;Remind me to get a beeper or something,&quot; Faith
sighed.

&quot;If you two get much more sappy,&quot; the waitress noted
as she hurried by to fill a customer&#39;s order, &quot;I may
be ill.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s so hard to find good help,&quot; Tara said wryly.

Meanwhile, in the formerly deserted mansion the
Summers clan and Willow called home, the usual evening
rising activities were taking place. &quot;If you have to
do that,&quot; Dawn summers complained good naturedly,
&quot;could you at least not do it in front of the
fireplace where I could see you two?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re sorry,&quot; Willow sighed as she drank carefully
from a mug of pigs blood that Giles had dropped off
earlier that day.

&quot;I think I&#39;ve been traumatized for life,&quot; Dawn
shuddered.

&quot;We feel for your trauma,&quot; Buffy said as she got out
the makings for dinner from the fridge, &quot;but I am
still not increasing your allowance.&quot;

&quot;Aww,&quot; Dawn pouted.

Willow shook her head, smiling a red-tinted smile.
&quot;You two scare me at times,&quot; she noted, yawning a bit.

&quot;Coffee?&quot; Buffy offered.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t do anything for me now,&quot; Willow admitted,
&quot;though I do still like the taste.&quot;

&quot;Just don&#39;t use the same mug,&quot; Dawn made a face,
&quot;that&#39;d be just ewww.&quot;

&quot;Giles&#39;ll be coming over later,&quot; Buffy noted, &quot;try
not to give him too much grief, okay?&quot;

&quot;Would I do that?&quot; Dawn tried to look innocent.

&quot;Very easily,&quot; Buffy said, &quot;I&#39;m well aware of how you
set the kitchen on fire.&quot;

&quot;Well, at least it was while trying to make you a
cake,&quot; Willow had to point out.

&quot;True,&quot; Buffy smiled.

&quot;I thought Miss Calendar magicked the whole mess away
once we got the fire out?&quot; Dawn blinked.

&quot;I&#39;m sort of sensitive to the whole magic thing,&quot;
Willow confessed a bit shyly, &quot;trust me, I could
tell.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Dawn sighed, &quot;there goes one way I thought I
could use to get away with stuff.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a teenager,&quot; Buffy noted, &quot;you&#39;ll figure out
something.&quot; She smiled slightly, thinking back to all
the times she had outwitted her old watcher. &#39;Better
be careful about encouraging her,&#39; she thought.

&quot;Buffy, dinner,&quot; Willow warned, getting up to move a
saucepan off the heat. &#39;Guess burning food is a family
thing,&#39; she chuckled mentally,</pre>
