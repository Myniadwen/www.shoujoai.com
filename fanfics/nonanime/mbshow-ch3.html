<h1>The Mireille Bouquet Show (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/mbshow-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;And now,&quot; an almost emotionless voice said over the background noise of 
a madly cheering audience, &quot;It&#39;s time once again for the Mireille 
Bouquet show. Tonight&#39;s guests are Steve Irkel, Chibi Moon, and Ernest 
P. Worrel. And now, ladies and gentleman, let&#39;s hear it for Mireille 
Bouquet.&quot;

The audience once again applauded exuberantly as the blonde host came 
out on stage, &quot;Thank you, thank you very much,&quot; she said as she bowed to 
the adoring crowd, &quot;And now, let&#39;s hear it for my co-host, the Bert to 
my Ernie, Kirika Yumura!&quot;

The studio rocked with the sound of clapping as the somber-looking 
co-host came out and likewise bowed. The two then went to the stage to 
take their seats for the opening dialogue.

&quot;Wow,&quot; the host said, &quot;Irkel, Chibi Moon and Ernest. Three characters 
that a surprising number of people find irritatingly annoying, eh 
Kirika?&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; the young Japanese woman said as she nodded, &quot;Mireille...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; the host said, &quot;I&#39;ve got my bat all shined up nice behind 
the desk here, but let&#39;s hope I don&#39;t have to use it.&quot;

&quot;Mmm.&quot;

We&#39;ll be bringing out our first guest momentarily,&quot; Mireille said to the 
audience, &quot;But before we do, it&#39;s time once again for viewer mail!&quot; she 
announced to cheering from the people in the studio. She then began to 
look around her desk with a puzzled expression, &quot;What th... Where are 
the letters?&quot; she asked, &quot;Can we have someone bring out the viewer 
mail?&quot;

A mysterious young woman with magenta colored hair pulled back into a 
ponytail came out onto the stage. She wore a green cloak, black boots 
that ended in a pair of kneepads, and a pair of Groucho glasses on her 
face to disguise her appearance. She silently passed Mireille the 
letters and turned to leave, stopping briefly to wink out at the 
audience before disappearing off stage.

Mireille smiled as she separated her fan mail from Kirika&#39;s, the co-host 
watching with a disturbed look from her seat.

&quot;Mireille?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Who was that person?&quot; Kirika asked suspiciously, &quot;I have the strangest 
feeling I&#39;ve seen her before.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; the blonde said, &quot;I think she&#39;s the new girl in the mail 
room.&quot;

&quot;Mmm.&quot;

&quot;And the first letter&#39;s for me, &#145;Dear Mireille, you have such beautiful 
platinum blonde hair, why is it your roots are so dark?&#39; Doh! Signed 
&#145;Rod Johnson,&#39; but the handwriting&#39;s the same as those others. It&#39;s you 
again, isn&#39;t it Mr. mysterious prankster? When I solve the mystery of 
who you are and get my hands on you, I&#39;ll rip your lungs out! I&#39;ll... 
Grrr... Kirika, read your letter.&quot;

&quot;Mmm. &#145;Dear Kirika, Mireille has mentioned that after the two of you 
left assassination behind, you worked briefly at a Denny&#39;s. Were there 
any other jobs the two of you tried your hand at before hosting this 
show? Mmm...&#39;&quot; the former assassin muttered, looking thoughtful as a 
flood of memories began to rush back...

-Flashback-

The blonde Corsican and her young Japanese partner stood before a 
conveyer belt. They were wearing large white aprons and chef&#39;s hats, 
both taking in the surroundings of their new job as their new boss 
walked into the room with them.

&quot;Okay ladies,&quot; the female manager began, &quot;It&#39;s simple; the chocolates 
come down the conveyer belt, you wrap them in the little paper wrappers, 
and then set them aside. Got it?&quot;

&quot;Mmm.&quot; Kirika answered, adding, &quot;Wasn&#39;t this in an I Love Lucy episode 
once?&quot;

&quot;Hush,&quot; Mireille said. She then turned to their manager, &quot;We&#39;ll do 
fine.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; their manager said. She then turned to the wall where the 
conveyer belt disappeared into a shoot that would send out the 
chocolates, &quot;Let &#145;er roll!&quot; she shouted. As the conveyer belt started up 
and the manager left the room, Mireille turned to Kirika.

&quot;When did you ever see I Love Lucy?&quot;

&quot;One of our hits was watching it before I sliced his head in half with a 
butter knife, remember?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; the Corsican said as the chocolates began to come down the 
line toward the two women. At first, the ex-assassins had no problem 
keeping up with the conveyer belt, wrapping up each sweet that came down 
the line and setting it aside. Soon though, one slipped by them, then a 
second. Mireille went after the two, only to have several more get by in 
her absence. Kirika tried her best to make up the slack for the older 
woman, but soon enough her rhythm was completely thrown off as well. She 
began desperately stuffing them into her shirt and in her chef&#39;s hat as 
Mireille raced back in line next to her, likewise stuffing them into her 
hat and even her mouth in an attempt to keep up with the line.

Suddenly a set of footsteps alerted the two to the approach of their 
manager. &quot;Ririra!&quot; Mireille cried out to her partner with a mouth full 
of chocolate-covered cherries, &quot;Rut roh!&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika answered before stuffing her own mouth with the 
chocolates. The two finished hiding the chocolates just in time as their 
manager strolled in.

&quot;Well,&quot; their supervisor said as she smiled broadly at the two, &quot;It 
looks like you&#39;re doing better than expected. That means we can speed 
the line up a bit,&quot; she exclaimed cheerfully.

Mireille and Kirika&#39;s eyes opened wide at that. They gave each other a 
worried glance, looked at their manager, then at the conveyer belt, then 
at each other once again.

&quot;Ririra...&quot; the Corsican managed to get out, her mouth still full of 
sweets.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; her dark-haired partner answered as she pulled out the 
semiautomatic she had hidden on her and blasted their supervisor away.

-End Flashback-

&quot;I plead the fifth,&quot; Kirika finally said in response to the letter.

&quot;Probably a good idea,&quot; Mireille answered as she opened her next letter, 
&quot;&#39;Dear Mireille, for some reason whenever I watch your show I seem to 
get an echo on the audio. Maybe it would help if you crossed your legs&#39;? 
Urgh! It&#39;s signed &#145;Hugh Jass&#39; but I know it&#39;s you out there! You have no 
idea what I&#39;m going to do to you, you little... Ooo...&quot; she said angrily 
as she clenched her fists, a vein sticking out of her forehead as she 
glared angrily at the letter, &quot;Why are all these stupid things being 
addressed to me?&quot;

&quot;Mireille?&quot;

&quot;It couldn&#39;t be the Soldats. After we were declared the true Noir, 
they&#39;ve left us alone.&quot;

&quot;Mireille?&quot; Kirika interrupted again, this time a bit more forcefully.

&quot;Oh, right,&quot; the blonde said, &quot;Go ahead with your next letter.&quot;

&quot;Mmm. &#145;Dear Kirika, I think you have a cute face and a sweet smile,&#39;&quot; 
she read, blushing slightly as a smile indeed crept onto her face, 
&quot;&#39;However, I am just a bit surprised that you decided to be with 
Mireille. I always thought Chloe was a better match for you. The two of 
you looked so good together, and I know she loved the kiss you shared 
with her in the bath. I...&#39;&quot; the young Japanese woman was cut off as 
Mireille tore the letter away from her.

&quot;Viewer mail&#39;s over!&quot; the blonde hissed through clenched teeth, &quot;And now 
let&#39;s bring out our first guest,&quot; she said, taking a deep breath to calm 
herself before she continued, &quot;Originally a supporting character on the 
show Family Matters, he eventually stole the lead role and consequently 
drove the series into the ground. Let&#39;s hear it for Steve Irkel.&quot;

A smattering of clapping was heard as the klutzy nerd strolled out onto 
the stage, his tight pants pulled up to his navel. He sat down in the 
seat nearest the host and gave the Corsican a dirty look as he pushed 
his thick Coke-bottom glasses up the bridge of his nose.

&quot;What kind of an introduction was that?&quot; he asked in an annoying nasally 
voice.

&quot;Sorry Steve,&quot; the host said as she lazily tossed a few of her blonde 
locks back, &quot;I&#39;m just having a bad day, I guess.&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika added, &quot;There&#39;s a mysterious prankster going after her.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Steve asked, &quot;You mean those aging hippies in California?&quot;

Mireille shook her head, &quot;No, not Merry Pranksters,&quot; she corrected, &quot;A 
Mysterious prankster. Someone&#39;s writing me rude letters.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Mmm.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Mireille said, &quot;According to this, you&#39;re some sort of genius, 
especially with electronics and mechanics.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Irkel said, smiling self-assuredly, &quot;That&#39;s true. I once created 
a robot version of myself, and...&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Kirika interrupted, &quot;What kind of weapons did it have?&quot;

&quot;Well, I...&quot;

&quot;Did you program it to kill your enemies, or just cripple them?&quot; the 
co-host asked as she interrupted again.

&quot;Kirika!&quot; the blonde host said as she gave the young woman a stern look, 
&quot;Wait until I&#39;m done with my questions, okay?&quot;

&quot;Mmm. Sorry mistress... er... Mireille,&quot; the younger woman said as the 
Corsican buried her head in her hands out of embarrassment.

&quot;Why is my day going like this?&quot; the blonde asked as she rolled her 
eyes. Finally she looked back up and addressed Irkel again, &quot;Anyways, I 
was wondering, since you&#39;re such a whiz with mechanics, do you think you 
could fix a watch for me?&quot;

&quot;A watch?&quot; the guest asked.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika answered, &quot;It&#39;s very important to Mireille, and was broken 
a while back during a battle in which I had to kill a young woman named 
Chloe.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Sure thing,&quot; he said as he pulled out a screwdriver from his pant&#39;s 
pocket, &quot;Let me see the watch.&quot;

&quot;Here,&quot; Mireille said as she passed it to the young genius, &quot;It&#39;s 
supposed to play a song when you open the cover. Please be careful; it&#39;s 
a family heirloom,&quot; she explained before turning back to the audience, 
&quot;And now for our next guest. She&#39;s a rather controversial figure, as 
people either seem to love her for being so sweet or hate her guts for 
being overly cute and seemingly having an Electra complex big time for 
her future father Mamoru. If there are any viewers out there who suffer 
from hyperglycemia we urge you to leave the room now. Let&#39;s hear it for 
Sailor Chibi Moon!&quot;

There was a mix of both clapping and booing from the audience as the 
future daughter of Neo-Queen Serenity came out on stage. The pink-haired 
youngster took a seat next to the nerd working on the watch and gave the 
host a look.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t very nice,&quot; the young Senshi in training pouted, &quot;I&#39;ve only 
had an adverse affect to a few diabetics and you know it!&quot;

&quot;Do you need any help?&quot; Kirika asked Irkel.

&quot;No thanks, babe,&quot; Steve answered as he continued to work away next to 
Chibi Moon, &quot;I&#39;ll have this clock lens off in no time.&quot;

&quot;So, Chibi Usa,&quot; Mireille said, ignoring her guest&#39;s angry glare, &quot;I 
understand you have a thing for dream horses and annoying the hell out 
of your future mother.&quot;

&quot;Pegasus is not just a dream horse!&quot; the youngster exclaimed, &quot;He&#39;s 
real, and...&quot;

&quot;We had your future mom on the show not that long ago,&quot; Kirika said.

&quot;Mine?&quot; Irkel asked.

&quot;No, Chibi Usa&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Chibi Usa interrupted irritably, &quot;If you had her on, you&#39;ll 
understand why I can&#39;t get along with the woman!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; the co-host asked in surprised, &quot;Mireille and I thought she was 
a sweet and entertaining young lady.&quot;

&quot;Humph. To each their own, I guess,&quot; Chibi Moon said snidely.

Mireille looked from her diminutive guest over to the audience, a 
dangerous look in her eyes, &quot;Before things go any further,&quot; she said, 
her eye beginning to twitch slightly, &quot;Let&#39;s bring out our last guest. 
He&#39;s the star of a series of horrible movies that apparently appeal to 
inbreeds and hicks. Here he is folks, Ernest P. Worrel.&quot;

The guest in question came out, wearing his trademark vest and hat. He 
smiled goofily as he waved out at the audience, &quot;Hey Verne!&quot; he said 
cheerfully, &quot;Check it out; I&#39;m on French television!&quot;

&quot;Oh goody,&quot; Chibi Usa quipped from her seat, &quot;I get to sit next to the 
loud obnoxious American.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Mireille said, &quot;As I noted in the intro, you&#39;ve starred in several 
rather awful films.&quot;

&quot;Awful?&quot; Ernest asked, obviously offended, &quot;Listen here, I...&quot;

&quot;They were playing Ernest Goes to Camp on television last week,&quot; Kirika 
said, &quot;I watched it.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Ernest asked, &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;All ninety minutes of it,&quot; she added, a sad and lost look now present 
in her eyes.

&quot;Kirika?&quot; Mireille asked in concern.

&quot;Ninety minutes of my life I&#39;ll never get back. Ever,&quot; the young co-host 
said as tears began to form at the corners of her eyes.

&quot;So,&quot; Mireille said, pressing on with the interview, &quot;Other than making 
bad films and cute little ex-assassins cry, what else do you do 
exactly?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Ernest said, &quot;I like to keep myself busy; you know what I mean 
Mireille? I like to fish, hunt...&quot;

&quot;And avoid taking baths,&quot; Chibi Usa added as she made a face, &quot;Good God, 
don&#39;t they have soap in America?&quot;

&quot;Do you mind?&quot; Ernest asked angrily, &quot;The nice French lady with the 
hairy armpits is trying to ask me questions, and I can answer her fine 
without any help from you. So why don&#39;t you go to the local automobile 
club, and show them what a real wreck looks like.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Chibi Usa asked as her face turned red with anger.

&quot;Will you two keep it down?&quot; Irkel asked in his annoyingly nasal voice, 
&quot;This is delicate work I&#39;m doing over here!&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika interrupted as the show began breaking down, &quot;Maybe we 
should all calm down, and...&quot;

&quot;And maybe you should go get yourself a personality transplant,&quot; Chibi 
Usa said, causing the young co-host to look down sadly.

Mireille&#39;s eye was now twitching madly as she scowled angrily at 
Chibi-Usa, &quot;Young lady,&quot; she hissed, &quot;If you ever talk to Kirika like 
that again, I&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;Hey, I know,&quot; Ernest said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you send her off to boot camp? 
That&#39;s what all those other talk shows do to bratty little punks.&quot;

&quot;Bratty little... Why you...&quot; Chibi Usa growled as Steve Irkel continued 
to work away on the watch that had belonged to Mireille&#39;s parents, 
&quot;Listen her you trailer-park trash hillbilly!&quot;

&quot;I told you before you pink-haired rat,&quot; Ernest answered back, &quot;Sit back 
and shut up while I&#39;m being interviewed.&quot;

&quot;Pink-haired...&quot; Chibi Moon stuttered out as she whipped out her henshin 
wand, &quot;Right, you asked for it!&quot; she declared, &quot;Pink Sugar Heart 
Attack!&quot; she shouted.

Everyone on stage looked at her strangely as nothing happened. Ernest P. 
Worrel was about to suggest she go replace the wand&#39;s batteries when a 
stream of pink hearts suddenly flew out of its tip. The recoil from the 
attack sent her backwards, knocking herself into Steve Irkel who was 
doing some particularly delicate work on Mireille&#39;s watch. Ernest 
managed to luckily duck in time to miss the Senshi attack.

Unfortunately, the attack instead hit the blonde host in the face, 
knocking her out of her chair behind her desk.

Chibi Usa meanwhile got off Irkel, who looked down to see his 
screwdriver was now driven through both the front and back of Mireille&#39;s 
watch by the force of the small Senshi falling on top of him. As he 
pulled the screwdriver out, all the internal screws and springs came out 
as well, falling all over the floor of the stage. He turned nervously to 
Kirika.

&quot;Did I do that?&quot; he asked as a hand came up from behind the host&#39;s desk, 
holding onto the top of it for support.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika answered as a second hand came up from behind the desk, 
this one holding a baseball bat. The young Japanese co-host then stood 
up and walked over so that she was standing in front of the nerd.

&quot;This is all your fault, you big poop!&quot; Chibi Usa shrieked at Ernest as 
Mireille&#39;s face finally appeared once again from behind the desk. She 
had a crazed look in her eyes, and her normally perfect blonde hair was 
frizzed out in all directions. She was also sporting a burn mark on her 
forehead in the shape of a heart. As she finally struggled to her feet, 
she gave Kirika a look.

&quot;Mmm,&quot; the younger woman said, knowing instinctively what the silent 
communication meant. She proceeded to lock Steve Irkel&#39;s head under her 
arm and fell backwards, driving the young nerd&#39;s head into the floor in 
the wrestling maneuver known as the bulldog. Before Chii Moon or Ernest 
had any time to react, Mireille swung her bat, hitting both of them in 
the back of the head.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Mireille said, looking down at the stunned and injured guests 
littering the stage floor, &quot;Much better.&quot;

&quot;Mmm.&quot;

&quot;Tune in next time when our guests will be Major Motoko Kusanagi, 
Barney, and Sister Rosette. Until then, bye,&quot; she said as Kirika and 
herself waved at the camera, the clapping from the studio audience 
drowning out the groans coming up from the floor.
