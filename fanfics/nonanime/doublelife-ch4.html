<h1>Double Life (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jsyxx.html">J-Syxx</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/doublelife-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>It was late at night in Beverly Hills. It would&#39;ve been completely dark 
if it wasn&#39;t for the moon light which made everything a seemingly blue 
tint. The light reflected off of Mandy&#39;s purple eyes as she stood next 
to the spies&#39; home. Her left hand was full of pebbles she managed to 
procure someplace. She took one in her right hand tossed it over her 
head up in the direction of a particular window on the second story. It 
bounced off with a light crack.

&quot;Spshhh.. Sammykins. Wake up.&quot; She said trying to whisper, but her 
naturally whiney voice was still quite loud.

Sam was lulled out of her sleep by the periodic taps at her window. She 
groggily opened her eyes and pulled the covers off her slim, athletic 
body. She walked over to the window, pushed up the sill, and looked 
down. Mandy&#39;s face looked up excitedly to greet her.

&quot;Mandy, it&#39;s a school night. Are you crazy?&quot;

&quot;Maybe I am. Put on something and get down here.&quot;

&quot;Oh, all right. Give me a minute.&quot; She didn&#39;t know why she was even 
listening to her. She closed the curtains over the window and unbuttoned 
her teal night shirt from top to bottom. She let it slide off her arms 
and body, and it fell to her feet. She then went and opened her closet 
to find something to wear. She yanked a small, olive dress with 
spaghetti straps off one of her hangers. She slipped it over her head 
and pulled it down over her chest and thighs. She proceeded to try and 
make herself somewhat presentable. After she was ready, she sneaked 
quietly down the hallway past Clover and Alex&#39;s doors careful not make a 
sound. Alex&#39;s was slightly ajar. She peaked in. Alex was out like a 
light and snoring loudly but somehow managed to pull off sounding cute 
at same time. Sam continued moving down the hall way stealthily and then 
down the stairs.

Alex suddenly shot up in bed. &quot;Fat Free FroYo.&quot; She got up and trudged 
her way towards the kitchen for a late night snack.

Sam finally made her way on the lawn to where Mandy was waiting for her.

&quot;What do you want Mandy?&quot; Sam sounded agitated. She looked it too.

&quot;I want to take you some where.&quot;

&quot;Why? Wouldn&#39;t you rather go with Chad?&quot; She spouted off.

Mandy was somewhat befuddled. &quot;Why would I want to go anywhere with that 
idiot?&quot;

&quot;I saw you today. You were all over him.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Mandy suddenly looked ashamed. She looked down and was quiet for a 
minute while she thought of a way to explain it to her. &quot;Sam,...... 
Sometimes I have to do things.. If I didn&#39;t people might start to 
suspect, you know. If they knew what I was at Bev High, I wouldn&#39;t last 
a minute. How else would I be popular?&quot; Mandy stopped and continued, 
&quot;You&#39;re the only one I really care about, I swear.&quot;

Sam soaked in her words for a moment. There was no way it could possibly 
be true.

&quot;You mean you don&#39;t like boys?&quot;

&quot;Never have.&quot;

Sam was dumb-founded. As far back as she could remember her, Mandy had 
spent an inordinate amount of time chasing boys. It seemed like every 
week her and Clover were having another epic battle over a different 
guy. She couldn&#39;t even count the number of boyfriends she had at some 
point or another, much more than Sam had ever had. Pretty much every 
male at school fawned over her, and she appeared outwardly to bask in 
all of the attention. This had all been a lie? She was much better at 
acting than Sam had ever been as a spy. She didn&#39;t even really like 
lying then. Having to live your whole life like that had to be a 
miserable existence.

&quot;Mandy, I&#39;m sorry. I had no idea.&quot; She was no longer mad at her. In 
fact, her eyes were watering up.

&quot;Its ok, Sammy. You don&#39;t have to be sorry.&quot;

&quot;But why do you trust me? Aren&#39;t you afraid I might give you away?&quot;

&quot;Of course I know I can trust you, Sam. I&#39;ve watched you since 
grade-school.&quot;

There was a silence for a while between the two. Sam broke it. &quot;I liked 
the flowers.&quot;

Mandy&#39;s face lit up brightly. &quot;Oh, it was nothing. Don&#39;t mention it.&quot;

Just then the front door was pushed open, and Alex stepped out clad in 
her pink pajamas. &quot;Sammy? Where are you?&quot; She started walking to the 
side of the house where Sam and Mandy were.

Sam heard her coming, and grabbed Mandy&#39;s wrist pulling her behind a 
bush that lined the house.

She whispered, &quot;Mandy get down.&quot; She sat down on the ground to hide 
herself from view.

&quot;Sure thing,&quot; she whispered back. Mandy straddled Sam&#39;s thighs then 
leaned her body forward on top of Sam, pushing and pinning her to the 
ground. Sam didn&#39;t protest. Any sudden movement might alert Alex of 
their presence. Some of Mandy&#39;s black hair draped over Sam&#39;s face. Mandy 
moved her face in closer so that their noses were touching.

&quot;This good?&quot; Sam put her hand over her mouth to quiet her. Alex was 
looking at Sam&#39;s car parked on the side, but she heard a noise from the 
bush and went to investigate.

Sam&#39;s hand felt around Mandy&#39;s side until she found her purse. She dug 
inside until she grasped a small glass, vile of perfume. She tossed it 
in the air. Thanks to a combination of Softball practice and spy 
training, the trajectory of the throw was perfect so that it sailed over 
the top of the house and landed near the front of their drive-way. Alex 
heard the sound of breaking glass and turned around in the other 
direction to go check it out.

Sam knew she had to move fast and silently or Alex would notice them. 
Reacting more or less on her spy instincts, Sam scooped up Mandy in both 
her arms and started sprinting stealthily to the back of their home. 
Mandy wrapped her hands around Sam&#39;s neck to hold on. She speedily, 
zigzagged around the pool and jacuzzi, and then hurdled over the line of 
bushes that separated their yard from Mandy&#39;s. She kept running until 
she was at Mandy&#39;s backdoor. She opened it, carried Mandy inside, and 
shut it behind her.

&quot;That was close,&quot; Sam said after finally coming out her fight or flight 
mode activated by the fear of getting caught. She then looked down at 
Mandy who stared back up at her from her arms looking completely 
flushed. Sam forgot she was even carrying her. &quot;Oh, sorry about that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Mandy replied as Sam let her down.

&quot;Owwww.&quot; Sam gripped her side. She was still reeling from the beating 
she took earlier that night.

&quot;Oh, Sam, are you hurt?&quot; Mandy asked very concerned.

&quot;No, I... um, just got hit with the ball today during soccer practice, 
that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Awwww, poor Sammy. Do you want me to help make it feel better?&quot;

&quot;Um, no thanks Mandy.&quot; She laughed nervously. &quot;It&#39;s not that bad, 
really.&quot;

&quot;Well, ok. I just hope you&#39;re not too sore for what we&#39;re going to be 
doing tonight.&quot; Sam&#39;s face became even redder. What did she mean by 
that?

&quot;Sammykins, follow me.&quot; Mandy gripped her hand and guided her though the 
hallways of the house until they reached her expansive bedroom.

&quot;Here sit down, make yourself comfy.&quot; Sam sat down on her lacey bed 
nervously. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a sec.&quot; Mandy pressed her finger against 
Sam&#39;s nose and winked at her seductively. She then went inside her walk 
in closet and closed the door.

Sam gulped.

A little while later, Mandy reopened the door. To Sam&#39;s relief she was 
as fully dressed as she was before. Mandy was also holding some items: a 
trench-coat, an over-sized hat, and a pair of sunglasses. She handed 
them to Sam.

&quot;Here put these on.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s so I can sneak you out of the neighborhood without anyone 
recognizing you, silly.&quot; Sam felt a bit stupid for not realizing, and 
put them on.

She stood up and modeled them for Mandy, &quot;How do I look?&quot;

&quot;Um, you look great, Sam.&quot; She looked ridiculous.

Meanwhile down the street at the spies&#39; home, Alex pulled a half-awake 
Clover, in her blue nightie, by her arm through the front door and to 
the drive-way.

&quot;And then I heard glass shattering. I think its perfume. Sam must&#39;ve 
dropped it from the flying saucer as the aliens took her away.&quot;

Clover walked over to the scene of the shattered perfume bottle careful 
not to step on the broken glass with her bare feet. She sniffed the air. 
&quot;No doubt about it, that&#39;s Foetor by Fernando.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that the kind you&#39;ve been wearing?&quot;

&quot;Yes, and I&#39;m still the only girl wearing it at school. Sam should ask 
me next time if she wants to use by beauty secrets.&quot; Clover looked at 
the ground sadly, &quot;And she wasted a whole bottle too.&quot; Alex knew she was 
lying. Mandy was actually the first girl at school to wear Foetor. 
Clover just copied her.

&quot;Well, let&#39;s call Jerry. We need to save her from the Aliens.&quot; Alex took 
out her X-Powder. Before she could open it Clover grabbed her wrist and 
put her other hand on her shoulder.

&quot;I don&#39;t think she was abducted by aliens, Alex,&quot; she told her calmly. 
&quot;She probably just dropped the perfume when she was sneaking out with 
that new, mysterious boyfriend of her&#39;s. He must be pretty hot stuff if 
she doesn&#39;t want us to know about him.&quot; Alex conceded that was the more 
logical explanation, but she was still concerned. This was the first 
time Sam had not told her about a new boyfriend. &quot;Come on, lets go back 
to sleep, ok?&quot;

&quot;Ok. Good night, Clover.&quot; She went back through the door. Clover was 
about to follow her when she noticed lights from behind. She turned 
around and saw Mandy pulling her black, convertible Porsche Carrera GT 
out of her garage. Mandy looked over in her direction and noticed Clover 
at the front door.

&quot;Get down,&quot; Mandy whispered as she took her hand and forced Sam to duck 
down at the waist. As she pulled out of the drive way, she gave Clover a 
nasty look.

&quot;I hope you drive that Porsche off a cliff ya bitch!&quot; she yelled.

Mandy responded by simply raising a middle finger in the air as she 
peeled by.

&quot;Did anyone see me?&quot; Sam said still hunched over.

&quot;No you&#39;re good. You can take off that junk now.&quot; Sam sat back up and 
took off the trench coat and glasses. She took off the hat and let her 
red hair run in the night air as they flew out of Beverly Hills.

&quot;Where are we going?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a secret.&quot;

They stopped at a light. &quot;So where did you guys go all day?&quot;

&quot;Um... We were at the mall.&quot;

&quot;Really? I was there today and I didn&#39;t see you.&quot;

&quot;We must&#39;ve just missed each other.&quot; Sam felt real guilty. Mandy had 
told her everything, and she was still lying to her.

The light turned green, and they drove for some time through the streets 
of L.A. They ended up in a part of town Sam wasn&#39;t familiar with. 
Finally, Mandy parked her car in an open lot.

&quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Mandy told her excitedly.

They both got out of the car. Mandy started walking in the direction of 
a building and Sam followed beside her. Sam looked up and read the pink, 
neon sign. It said, &quot;Double Flower.&quot; The words were followed by the neon 
image of two flower blooms facing each other. Their stems were bent into 
the shape of a heart. They passed through the door into a small enclosed 
room with a woman sitting behind a table. Mandy pulled her Master 
Platinum card out of her purse and paid for both of their entrance fees, 
and they passed through to the main part of the building. Sam looked 
around. It looked like any other dance club she had been to. It was 
dimly lit except for some colored lights, there was music playing 
loudly, and there was a crowd of people huddled on the dance floor. But 
after inspecting it a little closer, she noticed there weren&#39;t any guys 
to be seen, only girls.

&quot;Hey, Mandy what&#39;s up!&quot; a voice shouted from across the room. A girl 
with short, red hair wearing black leather approached them. It was 
Beverly Hills High&#39;s resident, biker bad-girl, Donna Ramone.

&quot;Hi Donna,&quot; Mandy greeted her. Donna did a double take when she saw who 
her companion was.

&quot;Sam,&quot; she said surprised, &quot;I didn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Well, no one else does either, if you catch my drift,&quot; Mandy told her.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, your secret is safe with me.&quot; A grin then formed on 
Donna&#39;s face, &quot;So Sam, you wanna dance?&quot;

Before she could answer, Mandy butted in, &quot;Hey Donna back off!&quot; she 
yelled with her voice getting even higher and whinier sounding than 
usual, shaking a clenched fist in the air. &quot;That is unless you want a 
free face-lift! She&#39;s my girl-friend!!!&quot;

&quot;My bad, my bad,&quot; she said with two, open hands raised in front of her. 
&quot;You two kids have fun now.&quot; Donna left them to go find other pursuits.

&quot;So I&#39;m your girl-friend now, huh?&quot;

&quot;Well, we kissed and you carried me. What else would you be?&quot; A 
mischievous look formed on Mandy&#39;s face. &quot;You&#39;re not using the 
Clover-scale are you?&quot;

&quot;Um, no.  Of course not.&quot;

&quot;Well, come on then. Let&#39;s dance.&quot; Mandy gripped her hand again and lead 
her to the dance floor. They danced. Sam was surprised at how good Mandy 
was. Sam liked the music and atmosphere, but above all she liked the 
close, personal attention from Mandy. Her body was in pain from the 
damage she sustained during the mission, but she some how was able to 
ignore it and enjoy herself.

After some hours they were back in Mandy&#39;s house.

&quot;I had a great time Mandy.&quot; Sam told her.

&quot;Well that means we can do this again some time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d really like that,&quot; she said truthfully. &quot;But I should go back home 
now. I need to get a little bit of sleep before school.&quot; Sam smiled at 
her. &quot;Good night, Mandy.&quot; She left out the back door, but Mandy pursued 
her and grabbed her arm.

&quot;Wait, don&#39;t I get to say good-bye first?&quot; Sam knew what she meant. 
Honestly, she had been waiting for it all evening.

&quot;Sure you can.&quot;

Mandy smiled as she put her hands around Sam&#39;s waist and pulled her 
close. She tilted her head a bit and moved in towards Sam. Sam moved in 
too meeting her half way, and their lips sunk into each other.

Meanwhile, in some undisclosed, darkened room, Sebastian viewed a 
monitor with his one eye that wasn&#39;t draped over with silver hair. He 
pressed a remote and the image zoomed in on Mandy&#39;s back porch.

&quot;Interesting,&quot; he said upon viewing the two girls locking lips. He 
pressed another button that switched on a communication link. &quot;We&#39;ve had 
a change of plans.&quot;

Finally, after lasting quite a long time, the kiss ended as Sam pulled 
her lips out of Mandy&#39;s.

Sam then stared lovingly into Mandy&#39;s eyes. &quot;Sweet dreams, Mandy.&quot; She 
left.

Mandy went back inside her house and walked through its twisting halls 
until she was back in her room. Mandy wished Sam would&#39;ve stayed, but 
for once in a very, long time she didn&#39;t feel so empty inside. She slid 
one of the straps of her dress off her shoulder. But she noticed two 
shadows on the ground emanating from behind her, and she slid it back 
up. She calmly walked over to her dresser and clenched a fist around her 
hand mirror.

&quot;Ahhhhhhhhh!&quot; She shrieked as she ran at the man on the left holding the 
mirror in the air. He was caught off guard and it smashed across his 
face. Jerrell fell to his knees and put his hands over his bleeding 
face. Mandy then tried to make a run for it.

&quot;No you don&#39;t,&quot; the taller Steve said. He clutched her arms and lifted 
her off the ground. She started wiggling around violently to break free, 
but he was too strong.

&quot;Let me GO!&quot; Mandy put her right knee up in the air and then kicked back 
as hard as she could. Her foot jabbed into his testicles hard. He 
dropped to the ground, moaning in pain. Mandy then sprinted down the 
hall way to escape. Unfortunately, Jerrell picked himself up off the 
floor and caught up with her, tackling her to the ground from behind. He 
pinned her to the floor as she continued to scream and shake around 
violently to break free.

&quot;Damn&#39;t, Steve! Use the rag!&quot; He screamed at his partner as blood ran 
down his face.

Steve wobbled over to them clutching his privates. He pulled a white rag 
out of his pocket and pressed it against Mandy&#39;s nose and mouth. Mandy 
tried to hold her breath as long as possible, but eventually she had to 
breathe in, and she inhaled the chloroform. Every thing around her faded 
into darkness.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;These ropes are too tight, LOOSEN THEM!!!&quot; Mandy screeched in the most 
high-pitched, annoying voice possible. She was tied to a chair in the 
middle of a white room, located where she didn&#39;t know. &quot;I&#39;m thirsty. Get 
me something to drink! NOW!!!&quot; Steve and Jerrell just sat on the couch 
in the room hopelessly with their hands over their ears. She had been 
going on like this for almost an hour. &quot;I&#39;m one of the richest girls in 
Beverly Hills! You can&#39;t treat me LIKE THIS!!!&quot;

Finally, the door opened and Sebastian walked into the room.

&quot;Can we kill her now, pleaaase?&quot; Jerrell pleaded. He now had several 
bandages over his face and fore-head.

&quot;Not yet, I need her to finish my opera.&quot;

&quot;Who is this chick, anyways?&quot; Steve asked.

&quot;She&#39;s the red-head&#39;s lover.&quot;

Sebastian&#39;s two cohorts suddenly looked at her with more interest. 
&quot;That&#39;s hot dude!&quot; Steve then clutched his privates again in pain.

&quot;What did you do to Sammy?! If you touch one hair on her head, I swear 
to god, I&#39;ll RIP YOUR LUNGS OUT!!!&quot;

Sebastian walked up to the chair and smacked her hard across the face 
with his metal claw.

&quot;I haven&#39;t done anything to her... Yet.&quot;

&quot;Nice claw. How&#39;d you loose your hand? Jacking off too much?&quot; She said 
as she spit blood on his shirt viscously.

&quot;Please shut her up, before I change my mind.&quot;

Steve took off the bandana he was wearing on his head, wrapped it around 
her mouth, and knotted it tight behind her neck. Mandy continued to try 
to talk back, but now all she could do was mumble sounds. After several 
minutes of doing that, she looked down at the ground in defeat. 
Everything had been going so well just before this happened, but now she 
was just really worried about Sam.
