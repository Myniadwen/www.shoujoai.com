<a href="../nonanime/wreckage-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>&quot;What do you think, ma&#39;am?&quot; the slim brown haired
woman pushed up her glasses as she lead her client
around the rooms of the apartment. Dressed in a
business suit she tried to look formal, but the
rebellious strands of her curly hair defeated that
intention.

&quot;Pretty nice,&quot; Jackie Lucas admitted, the taller black
haired woman looking around with a nod. &quot;First month&#39;s
rent and deposit?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yes miss,&quot; the young woman agreed. She rather
akwardly brought her clipboard around, &quot;Sign here?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Jackie took a moment to read over the papers.
&#39;Thank god for the job at Stane,&#39; she silently mused,
&#39;I&#39;d never be able to afford this on what&#39;s left of my
savings.&#39; She signed with a flourish, &quot;Here you go.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she smiled up at Jackie. A bit hesitantly
she added, &quot;Do you need recommendations for a moving
company?&quot;

&quot;I think I can manage,&quot; Jackie said as she took the
keys from the young lady, &quot;but thanks for the offer.&quot;

They both walked out to the hallway, the older
building comfortable yet still close to the busy city
center. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I hope you enjoy staying at
the Beverly Malibu.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Jackie smiled as they younger woman shook
her hand then hurried off, presumedly to another
appointment.

As Jackie was about to enter her suite she heard a
frantic voice call, &quot;Look out!&quot;

Spinning around Jackie barely managed to catch the
young woman, her, the lady and the lady&#39;s basket of
clothes spilling out to the ground. &quot;Are you all
right?&quot; Jackie asked, finding herself looking up into
beautiful blue eyes.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; the blonde pushed herself up, looking
sheepish as she continued, &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; She brushed one
of Jackie&#39;s arms, feeling the muscle beneath her
jacket as her eyes widened, &quot;Geeze, you&#39;re strong.&quot;

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Jackie said as she got to her feet, then
offered the young lady her hand. &quot;Jackie Lucas,&quot; she
introduced herself.

&quot;Amy Ray,&quot; she smiled charmingly up at Jackie.
Brushing her cut offs and tight t-shirt off she
smiled, &quot;So you&#39;re our new neighbor?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, just signed the paperwork this morning,&quot; Jackie
agreed. She sighed a bit regretfully, &quot;Sorry, I have
to get going...&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Amy smiled and waved as Jackie
headed off down the hall, &quot;I hope I&#39;ll see you again
sometime.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Jackie waved as she disappeared out the
front door.

Amy waited for a few moments then called out in a much
more business-like tone, &quot;Okay, you can have your
clothes back.&quot;

A somewhat more mousy black haired young woman hurried
up, her sweat suit much less charming looking. &quot;Why
did you want to borrow my clothes basket, miss?&quot; she
asked as she took a fifty dollar bill from the pretty
woman.

&quot;You ever hear of meeting cute?&quot; Amy smiled, &quot;It&#39;s a
tradition in movies for couples to meet in cute, funny
ways. It&#39;s memorable, and I want to be memorable to
her.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re an actress?&quot; the young lady pushed up her
glasses.

&quot;You could say that,&quot; Amy Ray, also known as Amora the
Enchantress, smiled slightly. Finding out
Thunderstrike was the Lucas woman was easy, and it
seemed tailing her here could provide several
opportunities. &quot;Now where did that realtor go,&quot; she
trotted off with a satisfied smile, &quot;I need to get a
suite here, too.&quot;

Unaware of the plotting going on Jackie slipped into a
alley and took out the battered mace from her shoulder
bag. Raising it up she hammered the handle to the
ground as lightning crash, transforming her into the
asgardian armored Thunderstrike. Spinning her mace in
a circle she flung it into the air as she grabbed the
chain attached to the end, the mystical weapon
carrying her swiftly into blue sky.

&#39;I&#39;ll never get used to this,&#39; Thunderstrike thought
to herself as she soared across the city of Los
Angeles. In minutes she reached a battered old hotel
in the less successful part of town, landing
unobserved on the roof. Transforming to normal Jackie
descended the stairs to her apartment, unlocking the
door and surveying the shabby interior.

&#39;Glad this is over,&#39; Jackie mused as she grabbed her
suit case and pulled the few items hanging in the
closet down. Packing up only took a few minutes, then
after sweeping the room with her eyes for anything
left she headed downstairs.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; the old man who ran the hotel asked as she
neared.

&quot;I&#39;m checking out,&quot; Jackie said, &quot;what do I owe you?&quot;

He looked at her in surprise, a cigarette dangling at
the corner of his mouth. His brown eyes narrowed a
bit, &quot;Oh really? You make some kinda big score, lady?&quot;

Jackie felt herself stiffen as several men lounging in
the hallway stood up. &quot;No, not that it&#39;s any business
of yours,&quot; she replied, shifting her feet slightly.

&quot;I say it is,&quot; he gestured to the men to come over,
&quot;especially if I think you can pay a bit more rent,
lady... maybe a moving fee?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t want to do this,&quot; Jackie warned, seeing the
young men bracing themselves for what they probably
thought was a easy fight.

A teen popped a switchblade, &quot;Oh, I think we do.&quot;

Jackie cracked her knuckles, &quot;I tried to warn you.&quot;

A few minutes later the hallway was filled with
unconscious men and broken glass, and a police car had
pulled up to investigate the ruckus. &quot;So,&quot; Officer
Sean O&#39;Connel asked, the redhead jotting down notes,
&quot;you were checking out, the manager decided to shake
you down and you fought back?&quot;

&quot;That would be it,&quot; Jackie agreed.

&quot;Tuh b&#39;tch ish luyin,&quot; the manager slurred through a
broken jaw.

&quot;Give it a rest,&quot; Sean gave the man a withering look,
&quot;we both know the contents of your rap sheet.&quot; She
turned back to Jackie, &quot;Sorry for the trouble. Do you
intend to press charges against him and his friends? I
bet the security cams here caught it all on tape.&quot;

Jackie had to fight a smile as the crook&#39;s face went
white. &quot;No harm done to me,&quot; Jackie said, &quot;but maybe
we can stop him from trying it on someone else.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Sean smiled, &quot;you mind going downtown with
me?&quot; She looked apologetic, &quot;We&#39;ll need a statement
there, too.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Jackie agreed, knowing that her furniture
shopping was going to be delayed for a bit longer.

Over an hour later Jackie stood outside the police
station, her suitcases sitting at her feet. &#39;All
right,&#39; she thought a little tiredly, &#39;back to the
Malibu where I&#39;ll drop these off, then I have to go
buy a bed.&#39;

&quot;Can I give you a hand?&quot; Sean came up beside her to
offer, having changed out of uniform to a simple shirt
and jeans.

&quot;Just have some errands to run,&quot; Jackie smiled
slightly.

&quot;Need a ride?&quot; Sean offered, looking down at the
suitcases. &quot;Otherwise, I can call you a cab,&quot; she
offered.

Jackie considered the offer, liking the look in her
green eyes. &quot;I&#39;d like a ride, then,&quot; she admitted, &quot;if
you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Sean grinned, trotting off before returning a
few moments later in a older model sports car. She got
out and tossed the suitcases into the back seat,
&quot;Where to?&quot;

&quot;The Beverly Malibu,&quot; Jackie said as she climbed in
the passenger side.

Sean checked both ways then pulled out into traffic as
she said, &quot;The Malibu? Did you know there was a famous
murder there a few years back?&quot;

&quot;No, but with my luck,&quot; Jackie smiled wryly, &quot;that&#39;s
the apartment I just rented.&quot;

Sean chuckled softly, &quot;Even if it was, it was years
ago.&quot; They smoothly sped through traffic, &quot;Pardon my
asking, but how do you manage in LA without a car?&quot;

Jackie chuckled, &quot;I have ways.&quot;She looked out the
window, the wind sweeping her hair back as she
admitted, &quot;I suppose I&#39;ll need to get one, though.&quot;

Sean swept Jackie with her eyes before turning back to
the road. &quot;I could make a few suggestions...&quot; she said
with a smile.

&quot;Why are you being so friendly?&quot; Jackie had to ask,
&quot;I&#39;m from New York, this sort of thing doesn&#39;t happen
very much.&quot;

That got a laugh from Sean. &quot;Not so much here, too,&quot;
she admitted, &quot;but you have this... little lost lamb
look about you.&quot;

&quot;You think that after I beat those men up?&quot; Jackie
blinked.

&quot;Physically you&#39;re tough,&quot; Sean agreed, though she
probably had no idea how tough Jackie really was, &quot;but
you do have a oddly helpless side, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll have to think about it,&quot; Jackie conceded.

They pulled up in front of the small, old fashioned
building as Sean smiled, &quot;Sorry if I was being too
intrusive.&quot;

Jackie grabbed her suitcases and smiled, &quot;Nah, it&#39;s
all right. You may even have a point.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Sean took one of her cards out, writing her
number on it, &quot;if you need a hand, call me. I&#39;d like
to help.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; Jackie promised then watched
her drive away.</pre>
