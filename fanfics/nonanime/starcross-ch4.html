<h1>Star-Crossed Betrayal (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/starcross-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Chaos walked along the barely visible path with a faint smile.  Ever 
since leaving the peak of Everest, she had reverted to her more 
human-like form and began wearing her sword on her belt.  She had easily 
ignored the stares and whispers, and quickly killed anyone who 
questioned it.  Her smile was partly caused by the deaths, but mostly 
brought about by her journey.

It had been at least eight years since she had been in Azarath-far 
longer if one did not include the time spent training Raven.  Chaos drew 
a deep breath, savoring the scent the wind pulled from the trees around 
her.  It had always been a lovely place where she was walking.  It had 
been that way for at least five thousand years, if she remembered 
correctly.  The trees suddenly gave way to a clearing occupied by a 
house surrounded by stonewalls.  Chaos smiled-truly smiled-at the sight.

She walked through the open gate, passing through an invisible barrier 
and entering into an open area.  A few single-story edifices lay within 
the light brown stonewalls, and one building in particular caught her 
eye.  A man with black-feathered wings stood from the low terrace that 
encompassed the buildings and walked towards her.

&quot;Welcome home, daughter,&quot; Lucifer Morningstar greeted her with a smile.

&quot;It&#39;s good to be home, father,&quot; Chaos said in turn.

----------

&quot;I believe you started a trend in humans, daughter,&quot; Lucifer murmured.  
&quot;I&#39;ve seen so very many humans drinking herbal tea that I always have to 
laugh when I see them.&quot;  Chaos chuckled in return, sipping at her herbal 
tea.

&quot;You influenced those girls as well,&quot; he sighed.  &quot;Both Raven and Kali.&quot; 
 He paused as a thought struck him.  &quot;You&#39;ve never spoken much about 
Kali.  Tell me about her.&quot;  Chaos smiled, continuing to sip at her tea.

&quot;Very well,&quot; she said.  &quot;I met her a long time ago.  It was about the 
time...I believe it was just about the time that the Edo period in Japan 
had started.  We met there, in Japan.&quot;

----------

Chaos chuckled madly at the bodies that lay strewn on the floor and the 
blood on her sword.  She truly enjoyed this age where swords ruled the 
outcome of the world.  Japan was an excellent country to continue her 
current rampage.  The western countries had begun their 
industrialization, and swords were giving way to gun and cannons.  
Despite all this, Chaos refused to give up her sword.  She preferred the 
thrill that a duel with a sword gave and the way that blood gleamed on 
the blade.  It was a perfect time for the demon.

She slid her sword into the sheath on her back, but kept her hand on the 
hilt for a moment.  A soft rustle had caught her ear.  The wind was very 
still that night and the bodies couldn&#39;t have moved.

&quot;Whoever you are,&quot; Chaos said in perfect Japanese, &quot;come out here so I 
can kill you.  You aren&#39;t going to live past tonight, and you can&#39;t kill 
me.&quot;  She turned about and was suddenly tackled, sharp claws sinking 
into her chest and throat.  Fangs followed the claws and slid into her 
shoulder.  After a moment, positive that Chaos was dead, the assailant 
stood up and wiped the black blood from their mouth.

&quot;Guess you were wrong about me killing you,&quot; the person, a black-haired 
woman chuckled darkly.  &quot;I killed you in one move.&quot;  She began to walk 
away, but froze in shock at the sound of Chaos moving.  Chaos stood up 
easily, a fanged grin showing on her face.

&quot;Happy with your little achievement?&quot; she asked.  &quot;You gave me a couple 
scratches.&quot;  To prove her point, she gestured at the rapidly healing 
wounds.  The black-haired woman paled in shock and terror.  She turned 
on heel and began to run, but Chaos was far faster.  She pounced, quite 
literally, and slammed the other woman to the ground.

&quot;Do you have any idea who you&#39;re attacking, little one?&quot; Chaos chuckled, 
her eyes narrow with glee.  &quot;I know exactly what you are.  I felt you 
hiding there in the shadows, little demon.  Perhaps I should call you by 
name, Kali.  Why is a demon like you attacking a demon like me?&quot;  Kali 
froze under Chaos, her wrists trapped in Chaos&#39; hands.  She suddenly 
realized who the woman pinning her was.

&quot;You&#39;re Hell&#39;s heir,&quot; she whispered in awe.  &quot;I-I wouldn&#39;t have attacked 
you if I realized that!  Forgive me!&quot;  Chaos chuckled at her.  Her red 
eyes roamed shamelessly, taking in the figure in the dark crimson 
kimono.  She smiled briefly and pressed her lips against Kali&#39;s.  The 
other demon froze from head to toe, both aroused and confused by the 
kiss.

&quot;I think I like you,&quot; Chaos purred after pulling away.  &quot;I&#39;ll let you 
live because of that.&quot;  She stood up and offered her hand to Kali.  Kali 
eyed her nervously, but took Chaos&#39; hand.  The taller demon pulled Kali 
to her feet with ease and brushed a blade of grass from her shoulder.  
She smiled at her and turned about to leave.  Kali&#39;s hand twitched, and 
then shot out to grab Chaos&#39;.  Chaos looked over her shoulder to see 
Kali staring at the ground.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Kali murmured.  &quot;I&#39;m...frightened.&quot;

&quot;Of what?&quot; Chaos asked.  &quot;I said I&#39;m letting you live.  I don&#39;t see what 
you could be afraid of any longer.&quot;

&quot;Please!&quot; Kali hissed.  &quot;The only reason I know that you&#39;re Hell&#39;s heir 
is because of something I felt inside me.  I don&#39;t even know what I am.&quot; 
 Chaos turned to face the shorter woman, a small smirk on her face.

&quot;Of course you don&#39;t,&quot; Chaos chuckled.  &quot;You were thrown out of the 
house that you were traded to when the humans saw that tail you hide 
under your kimono.  You&#39;re what that man Shakespeare would call a 
changeling.  You were given up in exchange for a human child-your blood 
parents most likely wanted a feast of human flesh.  I believe I killed 
them one night twenty years ago back in Europe.  How old are you?&quot;

&quot;I lost track at fifty,&quot; Kali whispered in return.  &quot;How can I be so old 
and still look like I&#39;m barely an adult?&quot;  Chaos chuckled and pulled 
Kali close.

&quot;Come with me and I&#39;ll explain exactly what you are,&quot; she laughed.  Kali 
nodded tentatively.  Chaos grinned and pulled her free hand back, 
closing it into a fist.  Before Kali could even pull in a breath of 
shock, Chaos&#39; fist connected with her forehead.  She fell into the 
darkness.

----------

&quot;Where did you take her?&quot; Lucifer questioned.  Chaos smirked and snapped 
her clawed fingers.  Instantly, the handle-less mug was refilled with 
herbal tea.  She took a sip and smirked again.

&quot;I took her where I live outside Azarath,&quot; she replied.  &quot;I took her to 
the very top of Mount Everest.  I can easily control the weather up 
there, and it&#39;s absolutely silent.  I&#39;ve been there for the past few 
months meditating.&quot;

&quot;Your death gave you much to think about,&quot; Lucifer murmured.  &quot;I 
understand.  My own death gave me quite a bit to ponder.&quot;

&quot;Your death,&quot; Chaos scoffed.  &quot;You mean your suicide.  You were always 
Heaven&#39;s most favored angel.  That&#39;s why you let yourself fall.  You 
knew that Heaven needed its opposite, so you made yourself the ruler of 
Hell.  But in your rush to aid Heaven, you suffered the madness that 
I&#39;ve suffered as well.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Lucifer sighed.  &quot;That madness is what separates you and I 
from the angels and from the rest of the demons.  I have gone mad many 
times over in my long, long life.  And you have done the same.  So what 
happened with your woman?&quot;  Chaos laughed aloud at her father&#39;s 
question.

&quot;Things went amazingly well with her for years,&quot; she answered.  &quot;I 
taught her many things.  I even made her a sword of her own.  She was so 
glorious in battle.  I&#39;ve never had a better time in my life than when I 
was with Kali.&quot;  Lucifer caught the sad tone in his daughter&#39;s voice.

&quot;And you still left her,&quot; he said softly.  &quot;I remember that night when 
you left her.  What happened that night?&quot;  Chaos frowned, putting her 
mug down beside her.

&quot;It was probably never supposed to happen,&quot; she began.  &quot;My dreams were 
starting to become enslaved in a madness.  Kali must have watched me 
sleep, or she never would have done what she did.  She&#39;s able to...how 
do I put this?  She can move through anything in the real world, but her 
greatest power is being able to move into any dream that she wants.  
Unfortunately, when she enters a dream, anything that happens in the 
dream becomes real.&quot;

----------

Kali frowned at Chaos&#39; shaking hands.  She knew that Chaos was suffering 
in her dreams, but her lover had expressly forbid her from entering her 
dreams.  Chaos had promised that nothing was wrong and Kali had nothing 
to worry about.  However, Chaos&#39; almost inaudible whimpers sent a sharp 
pain through her chest.  It seemed so very wrong to hear Chaos make a 
sound like that.

&quot;I know you told me not to interfere with your dreams,&quot; Kali whispered 
softly into Chaos&#39; pointed ear.  &quot;But I just can&#39;t let your mind be 
tortured like this.  I care about you too much.&quot;  She closed her eyes 
and willed herself into Chaos&#39; dream.

&quot;Chaos!&quot; she called into the red-toned dimness.  &quot;Chaos, where are you?  
Please, answer me!  You need to wake up and stop this dream!&quot;  A loud 
scream, terrified and male, sounded in the strange dream world.  A 
bright burst of red brought light to the place and revealed Chaos 
standing not but a few yards away.  Now that she had seen Chaos, her 
eyes adjusted and tracked the demon easily.

&quot;Chaos, come on,&quot; Kali said with a relieved smile.  &quot;You need to wake 
up.&quot;  Chaos seemed far more dangerous than Kali had ever seen her 
before.  The blood splattered on her body and the sneer that bared her 
fangs frightened Kali terribly.  Abruptly, she realized why Chaos had 
warned her not to enter her dreams.

Before she could let her magic fade away to return her to the waking 
world, Chaos was upon her.  The madness that had consumed Chaos&#39; 
dreaming world let out an awful laugh before striking with her sword.

Chaos woke to Kali screaming.  She jerked into a sitting position and 
looked to Kali.  The heir to Hell froze in shock at what she saw.  Kali 
was bleeding-her body had been cut through in an &#39;x&#39; shape.  Kali&#39;s 
demon healing stopped at a certain point and was only good enough to 
heal her body back together.  Everything inside her, however, had been 
brutally slashed and bled profusely.

Her blood stained everything, and she had quickly fallen unconscious.  
Chaos froze as her eyes picked up on something both subtle and dire.  
Kali&#39;s blood had begun to slow in its rapid departure.  She was about to 
die.  Chaos was paralyzed.  She watched, unable to do anything, as Kali 
died quickly, but painfully.

Even though she had killed hundreds of thousands of people, Kali&#39;s 
corpse struck a painful chord deep inside Chaos.  Too late, she realized 
that Kali was not a mere passing fancy.  She loved Kali with all her 
black heart.  Gently, almost reverently, Chaos picked up Kali&#39;s 
blood-covered body.  Her red eyes set in determination; Chaos went to 
beg her father to return Kali&#39;s life.

----------

&quot;You did beg me,&quot; Lucifer chuckled slightly.  &quot;You actually fell to your 
knees out of despair and begged me to resurrect her.  I did bring her 
back to life, but then you returned her to where you had been living in 
Asia and vanished from her life.  Why exactly did you beg for her life 
if you didn&#39;t intend to stay with her?&quot;  Chaos finished her tea once 
again, but did not refill it.  She looked at her father, eyes sad and 
serious.

&quot;I begged you to bring her back because her death was honestly too 
painful to bear,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;I was worried that my madness might 
get the better of me again one day, and I doubt that even Heaven could 
bring a person back a second time.  I left her because I love her and I 
needed to get a hold on my mind, like you have.&quot;

&quot;It took me a few thousand years,&quot; Lucifer admitted.  &quot;A few thousand 
years and a time where I meditated for years on end.  Have you managed 
to find your final madness?&quot;  Chaos smiled and stood up, brushing 
herself off.  She slid her sheathed sword onto her belt and started to 
walk away.  She turned on heel and smiled brightly at her father.

&quot;I have indeed,&quot; she chuckled.  &quot;I have some things to attend to in the 
human world.  I believe Kali is acting very foolishly and I need to save 
her again.  Farewell for now, father.&quot;  Lucifer smiled in return.

&quot;Farewell for now,&quot; he replied.
