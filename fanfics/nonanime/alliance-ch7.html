The hall was hidden deep beneath the sleepy college
town of New Carthage, the remnant of some old fall out
shelter that was remade to fit their darker purpose.
The floor was covered with rugs, the walls by
tapestries depicting great battles and lanterns lit up
the men and women who were kneeling there, waiting.

She stalked out of the shadows dressed all in black,
moving like a cat soundlessly and gracefully to the
podium up above the floor. Short black hair fell into
her eyes, her face a mix of races, but whoever she was
she commanded instant respect. &quot;Begin,&quot; Cassandra Cain
ordered, studying them intently.

Almost instantly the men and women below her fell into
a wild battle, first and feet flying as they fought
each other. Blood splattered the floor as blows
landed, some falling while others stood tall, proving
their skills in the only real way.

&quot;Enough,&quot; Cassandra called out harshly and the
fighting stopped as soon as it started. She leapt down
to join them, walking over the fallen fighters as she
studied the survivors. &quot;You, you and you,&quot; she pointed
out three more of them, &quot;you were marked in the
fighting. Leave here, and take the fallen with you.&quot;

The three men picked up the fallen and left, even as
the two survivors faced Cassandra. The young man wore
red, a simple body suit without pouches or
decorations, tight enough not to catch on anything yet
lose enough to give freedom of movement. The woman
wore blue, her costume tattered a bit but otherwise
fine, and her brown hair and eyes shone as she studied
Cassandra intently.

&quot;You two are now initiates,&quot; Cassandra told them
gravely, &quot;you have faced many tests to come here, but
I tell you now that this is just the beginning of your
trials.&quot; A serious meeting of their eyes, &quot;You will
learn of the League, of how to be an assassin and you
will grow to hate. Teachers will hurt you, tests will
hurt you, and you will hate us all for what we do to
you. But that hate will make you strong.&quot;

Cassandra turned, her long black hair flowing like a
cape. &#145;God she&#39;s beautiful,&#39; both young people found
themselves thinking.

&quot;Go now, back to your lives and close them off,&quot;
Cassandra instructed them. &quot;Leave not a trace of you
behind. You belong to the League of Assassins now.&quot;
With that she seemed to disappear into the shadows,
leaving them alone once more.

&quot;Do you really believe that?&quot; a quiet voice asked as
Cassandra walked through the tunnels to her quarters
once more.

Cassandra seemed to relax a bit, her steely manner
fading a little as she ran a hand though her hair, &quot;Of
course not, Leslie.&quot;

Doctor Leslie Tompkins shook her head, the older woman
walking over to Cassandra as she asked, &quot;So why do you
tell them that?&quot;

Looking faintly amused Cassandra answered, &quot;Because
that&#39;s what they expect to hear.&quot;

Leslie stared into Cassandra&#39;s eyes, making a soft
noise with her tongue. &quot;Your eyes are dilated,&quot; she
noted, &quot;and you look pale. Withdrawl symptoms?&quot;

Cassandra grimaced but nodded reluctantly. &quot;That crap
Slade used on me is hard to shake,&quot; she admitted
reluctantly.

&quot;Sit down,&quot; Leslie waved the girl to a seat, &quot;I&#39;ll
start a fluid iv as well as a painkiller for the
discomfort.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need...&quot; Cassandra started.

Leslie cut her off with a motherly look. &quot;You may not
need it,&quot; she noted, &quot;but you&#39;ll be in severe
discomfort without it. Now sit.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Cassandra smiled wryly.

It had been a few weeks since Leslie Tompkins had
contacted Cassandra, offering her services to the
leader of the League of Assassins. Cassandra had just
finished the disasterous adventure with Titans East,
where she first began to shake Slade&#39;s narcotic hold
on her, and the doctor had been invaluable in doing
so.

Leslie hummed softly as she worked, baring Cassandra&#39;s
sleeve and hooking her up to the intravenous fluids.
&quot;There,&quot; she said, &quot;just sit and relax for a few
minutes.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Cassandra sighed, already feeling the
pain begin to fade. &quot;Leslie,&quot; she asked, &quot;why are you
doing this?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Leslie looked at her curiously.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re helping me,&quot; Cassandra
said with a sigh, &quot;considering all the things I&#39;ve
done.&quot;

Leslie carefully rolled up the tubing, throwing away
the wrappers. &quot;I got to know you pretty well during
when Gotham was cut off,&quot; she said finally, &quot;you
aren&#39;t a evil person. And more importantly, you needed
help.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Cassandra sighed. She smiled slightly,
&quot;Thank you for telling me Steph was alive, too.&quot;

&quot;I knew how close you two were,&quot; Leslie acknowledged,
&quot;not letting you know would be cruel.&quot; She smiled,
&quot;Besides, I suspect she&#39;ll be looking for you soon
enough.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Cassandra acknowledged, &quot;and I&#39;ll have to
drive her away, just like I did Robin. Or else all my
sacrifices in going undercover this last year will be
for nothing.&quot;

&quot;I still think Bruce was insane, doing this to you,&quot;
Leslie frowned.

Cassandra smiled, &quot;I went into it with my eyes open.&quot;

Shortly after the battle with Alexander Luthor Batman
had approached Cassandra, laying out a daring and
dangerous plan. Cassandra would go undercover with the
League, joining them while claiming to be angry for
Batman choosing another defender for Gotham and
furious over her discoveries about her parentage.
Using her inherited position of One Above All she
would then learn all the secrets of the League,
eventually piping that information back to Batman to
destroy the Assassins once and for all.

&quot;Decieving Robin must have been interesting,&quot; Leslie
noted as she monitored the fluids going into
Cassandra.

&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Cassandra admitted, &quot;if I hadn&#39;t
been deliberately keeping him off balance with my odd
behavior, I&#39;m sure he would have seen through me.&quot; A
smile, &quot;I&#39;m not much of an actress, really.&#39;

Once the liquids finished pouring into Cassandra
Leslie carefully unhooked her, pulling the needle free
and bandaging up the wound. &quot;Feeling better?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;Much,&quot; Cassandra admitted, rising and stretching
gracefully. She sighed, &quot;Any idea how long it&#39;ll take
me to recover from my addiction to Slade&#39;s booster?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Leslie acknowledged. &quot;The drug Slade
dosed you with is derived from the same one that made
him Deathstroke, and it was experimental back then.
Frankly, I&#39;m shocked he&#39;d even risk giving it to you
or his daughter Ravager.&quot;

&quot;The bastard isn&#39;t exactly normal,&quot; Cassandra agreed
flatly.

&quot;I&#39;ll have to keep testing your blood samples,&quot; Leslie
sighed, &quot;my best guess? It&#39;ll be a few more weeks
before it&#39;s gone.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Cassandra nodded as she pulled her sleeve back
down over her arm, her expression thoughtful. &quot;I got
word a few hours ago,&quot; she revealed softly, &quot;Spoiler
is on her way here to New Carthage.&quot;

&quot;Steph?&quot; Leslie looked at her worriedly, &quot;What are you
going to do?&quot;

Cassandra sighed, &quot;Trick her, of course. I&#39;ll go into
my full villain act, do something dastardly and
generally try to convince her I&#39;m bad to the bone.&quot;

Leslie had to chuckle softly at that. &quot;You&#39;ll have to
be careful,&quot; she cautioned, &quot;I think Steph will be
harder to fool than Robin was.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll manage,&quot; Cassandra answered, &quot;I have to.&quot;
Steeling herself she said, &quot;I have to go see Nyssa,
I&#39;ll be back soon.&quot;

Watching Cassandra leave Leslie sighed, &quot;Be careful.&quot;

The tunnels lead under the city, eventually opening up
into a much more opulant chamber than the spartan
rooms that Cassandra used. Cushions covered the floor,
scented candles burned and the sweet scent of food
wafted through the room.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; Nyssa Raatko smiled, the black haired older
woman rising from her bed to greet Cassandra warmly.

&quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; Cassandra nodded respectfully.

&quot;Nyssa, sweet one,&quot; she chided, &quot;call me by my name.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Cassandra nodded as Nyssa stroked her
cheek, &quot;Nyssa.&quot;

&quot;Come,&quot; Nyssa led her towards the bed. In a cheerful
tone she asked, &quot;Do you know why I let you live after
you tried to assassinate me?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s part of a larger plan of yours,&quot; Cassandra
offered, even as she recalled that incident. Under the
instructions of Nyssa&#39;s sister Talia she had attempted
to kill Nyssa with a car bomb, deciding to go along
with the attempt for her own reasons.

&quot;Very true,&quot; Nyssa acknowledged. She lay back with a
smile, &quot;You are bound to obey the Demon&#39;s Head, and
since we two now lead, it creates difficulties for
you.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Nyssa,&quot; Cassandra agreed, even though honestly
she would have been happy to see both women dead.

Nyssa gestured her to come closer, &quot;Besides, there&#39;s
another reason to spare you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Cassandra asked as she sat down on the bed
beside Nyssa.

&quot;This,&quot; Nyssa drew her down into a lingering kiss.</pre>
