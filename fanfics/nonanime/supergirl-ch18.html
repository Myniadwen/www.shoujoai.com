<a href="../nonanime/supergirl-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>        A streak of red and a flash of bright green light, and then they 
were there on top of an older brownstone, the city stretching out around 
them. &quot;So this is New York,&quot; the Flash commented, the girl dressed in 
the red and gold bodysuit looking around her curiously.

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Green Lantern agreed, &quot;my hometown, more or less.&quot; She 
ran a hand through her dark green hair, glad it matched her green, black 
and white uniform.

        &quot;And the latest Firestorm&#39;s, according to Oracle,&quot; Flash 
murmured. She blurred for a moment then reported, &quot;I did an initial run, 
no sign of him.&quot;

        &quot;I suppose I could use a big ring-construct to get his 
attention..&quot; Green lantern looked down at her ring thoughtfully, then 
she was jerked out of her thoughts by an loud explosion in the distance.

        &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; Flash was gone, lightning arching around her.

        &quot;Iris never slows down,&quot; Green Lantern muttered then she bolted 
after her, her ring flaring as she traced the blast back to it&#39;s source.

        The side of the bank had thick black smoke pouring out of it, a 
massive gaping hole punched inward. Men and women all dressed in black 
scrambled around, hauling out sacks of money and other valuables away. 
Then the two women were there, and they knew they were in trouble.

        With a wave and a focused thought, Kyla used her ring to create 
a small army of talking animals to scoop up the criminals, even as Iris 
moved like the wind to trip up and otherwise disable them. In only a few 
moments they wrapped it all up.

        &quot;Well, that was fun,&quot; Iris grinned.

        &quot;Warn me next time you take off like that,&quot; Kyla scolded her 
with a gentle smile, generating a few cages for the crooks with her 
ring.

        The soft sound of clapping drew their attention to where a man 
stepped from the shadows, flames dancing around his head, dressed all in 
red and orange. &quot;Nice,&quot; Firestorm grinned, &quot;I only got the alarm a few 
minutes ago.&quot;

        Iris blinked, a bit of a blush coloring her cheeks as she took 
in the handsome young man. &quot;Actually,&quot; Flash smiled, &quot;we came here to 
see you.&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Firestorm blinked.

        &quot;Let&#39;s talk,&quot; Green Lantern put a power-ring bubble around Iris 
and Firestorm and flew them up to the top of a nearby building. &quot;You 
see,&quot; Kyla said once she put them down, &quot;we wanted to ask you to join 
the Justice League.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m honored,&quot; Firestorm looked surprised, &quot;but why me?&quot;

        &quot;J&#39;onnJ&#39;onzzsuggestedyou,&quot; Flash said, her eagerness running 
away with her once again as she speed-talked, 
&quot;hementionedthatyouwereapowerfulmember......&quot;

        &quot;Flash, slow down,&quot; Kyla laughed.

        Sorry,&quot; Flash blushed charmingly beneath her cowl. &quot;J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz 
suggested you,&quot; she said, &quot;he mentioned that you were a powerful member 
of the old League, with very creative abilities.&quot; Softly she added, 
&quot;Your being cute is just a bonus.&quot;

        &quot;Iris!&quot; Green Lantern scolded her in a whisper as she elbowed 
her friend in the ribs, hoping that the young man hadn&#39;t heard. 
Thankfully, he seemed to have missed it. &quot;We&#39;d like to take you up to 
the Watchtower,&quot; she smiled, &quot;you can talk with the others, too.&quot;

        Firestorm hesitated there a moment, &quot;I have to admit that I&#39;m 
tempted, but..&quot;

        &quot;But?&quot; Flash asked him eagerly.

        &quot;I promised my family that I&#39;d keep my true identity a secret,&quot; 
Firestorm finally said, &quot;would that be a problem?&quot;

        Green Lantern and Flash exchanged a long look.

        &quot;Not a problem,&quot; Flash said casually, even as...

        ... Green Lantern frowned slightly, &quot;This could be a problem.&quot;

        &quot;Which one?&quot; a slightly amused smile tugged at Firestorm&#39;s lips 
as he looked back and forth between the women.

        &quot;Why don&#39;t we ask Supergirl and Martian Manhunter?&quot; Green 
Lantern suggested, using her ring to trigger the Watchtower teleporters.

        In only a second they stood on the surface of the Moon, deep 
within the sentinel fortress that was the Watchtower. &quot;I&#39;ll go let the 
others know that we&#39;re here,&quot; and in a streak of red and a burst of 
lightning Flash was gone.

        &quot;Is she always that enthusiastic?&quot; Firestorm asked her 
curiously, the two walking down the metallic hallway together.

        &quot;Pretty much,&quot; Kyla agreed.

        They walked into the meeting hall together, and Firestorm slowed 
down a bit as he took in the group assembled around him. Supergirl and 
the Martian Manhunter were talking to Flash quietly, while Kestrel gazed 
out the window at space. Steel walked over, her silvery bodysuit 
gleaming, and they both turned as the two entered. Hovering above the 
meeting table itself was a holographic image of a woman in a wheelchair, 
and a pretty blonde haired girl sat nearby her, oddly dressed in what 
looked a lot like a maid&#39;s uniform.

        Supergirl separated from the others, walking over to Firestorm. 
Her blue T-shirt with the familiar &#39;s&#39; shield, blue pants and red boots 
all suited the redhead well. Her smile was warm as she said, &quot;Welcome, 
Firestorm. It&#39;s good to meet you.&quot;

        &quot;Th.. thank you,&quot; Firestorm stuttered a bit nervously.

        Supergirl introduced all the others in the room, and also helped 
identify the two figures that Firestorm didn&#39;t know as Oracle and Mecha. 
&quot;Flash tells me that you&#39;d like to keep your identity a secret,&quot; 
Supergirl finally said.

        &quot;We&#39;ve had members of the Justice League who have concealed 
their identities,&quot; Martian Manhunter said gravely. The green skinned 
humanoid alien continued, &quot;I see no reason that Firestorm shouldn&#39;t be 
able to do that as well.&quot;

        &quot;But what if he&#39;s got a criminal past in his secret identity?&quot; 
Steel asked, her battlesuit&#39;s plastic faceplate darkened to conceal her 
identity. She gave Firestorm an mildly apologetic look as she added, &quot;No 
offense meant.&quot;

        &quot;None taken&quot; Firestorm said mildly, &quot;it&#39;s understandable.&quot; A 
moment&#39;s hesitation, &quot;If it helps, I&#39;ll let the Manhunter scan my mind 
to confirm my good intentions.&quot;

        &quot;That won&#39;t be necessary,&quot; Oracle spoke up, &quot;I can confirm that 
Firestorm does not have a criminal record in his secret identity.&quot;

        Kestrel raised an eyebrow, visible even under her black mask. 
&quot;And how do you know that?&quot; she asked her respectfully.

        Oracle turned to look at the new arrival, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Firestorm, 
but I deduced your secret identity while I was investigating you before 
we contacted you. But as long as you wish to keep it a secret, I&#39;ll 
honor that request.&quot;

        &quot;Well, thanks,&quot; Firestorm looked a bit stunned.

        &quot;Does anyone else have any objections?&quot; the Martian Manhunter 
asked the others curiously, looking around the room.

        &quot;No?&quot; Supergirl gave the others a final chance to speak up then 
she offered Firestorm her hand, &quot;Welcome to the team.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Firestorm shook it firmly as the others gathered 
around.

        Flash drew her cowl back, shaking out her sandy brown hair. 
&quot;Iris West,&quot; she smiled up at him, &quot;it&#39;s nice to meet you.&quot;

        &quot;Kyla Scott,&quot; Green Lantern used her ring to remove her mask, 
giving the young man a much more cautious look.

        As the crowd gathered around Firestorm and the introductions 
continued Steel walked over to the Oracle hologram, &quot;Oracle?&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; the hologram answered.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s taken so long,&quot; B-ko said quietly, &quot;but your new 
body if finished.&quot;</pre>
