<h1>The Genesis Quest (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/genquest-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The Massachusetts Academy buzzed with life as repair
teams worked over the buildings, repairing the damage
from a earlier bombing and the neglect since the
facilities had closed. Along with construction a new
outer wall had already been finished, and sate of the
art security features were online already.

Jean Grey shaded her eyes as she watched the winch
hauling lumber up, her red hair flowing in the breeze.
Dressed in a simple green pantsuit she looked sleep
and beautiful, her figure shown off by the cut of her
clothes. Without trying she drew the eye of many men,
but her thoughts were elsewhere right then.

&#39;Damn Emma and Scott,&#39; Jean thought bitterly as she
turned away from the dorm building, looking at the
reconstructed school.

The building was actually quite a bit larger than
Xavier&#39;s school, a former prep school that was several
stories high and contained more of the proper school
facilities. In addition to regular class rooms they
had school labs, a gym and fine arts wing, now
repaired and ready for a new class of students.

&quot;Jean,&quot; Hank McCoy grinned, the catlike blue furred
mutant bounding over as she neared the school&#39;s front
door, &quot;the subsurface lab is up and running, and the
new Danger Room is nearly ready.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Hank,&quot; Jean smiled back, &quot;is the Professor in
the Danger Room?&quot;

&quot;Calibrating the holographic systems,&quot; Hank agreed.

Shortly Jean found herself peering into the control
room, seeing the Professor&#39;s legs sticking out from
under a console. Charles Xavier felt her presence and
slid free as the perfectly bald man smiled wryly,
&quot;Nearly done, Jean.&quot;

&quot;No hurry,&quot; Jean knelt down as she added teasingly,
&quot;we have the students practicing in the back yard.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure that would go over well with the
construction workers,&quot; Charles noted with some
amusement.

&quot;I bet we could cover it up,&quot; Jean laughed softly. She
paused a moment then added, &quot;I&#39;m sorry that my
situation has created problems for you.&quot;

&quot;You may have had personal reasons for this move,&quot;
Xavier noted gently, &quot;but I wouldn&#39;t have gone along
with it if you hadn&#39;t made sense.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jean smiled.

&quot;Logan,&quot; Colossus nodded as the steel fleshed man
helped haul a section of pre-made wall, &quot;I almost
expected you to stay with Scott&#39;s team.&quot;

Logan puffed on a cigar as he balanced the end of the
wall, his brown hair swept back in it&#39;s usual two
wings style. &quot;If something does happen Jeanie&#39;s gonna
need all the fighters she can get,&quot; he noted, silently
adding, &#39;and with Scott gone, maybe I could...&#39;

&quot;True,&quot; Colossus agreed as they set the wall into
place. In a short burst of light he shifted, steel and
chrome becoming flesh and blood. Piotr Rasputin pushed
his black hair out of his face as he took deep
breaths, glad to be alive once more.

Some time ago Piotr sacrificed himself to activate a
cure to the Legacy Virus, a cure that apparently
killed him. However, apparently was the word as they
later recovered a very much alive Piotr from a
geneticist&#39;s lab who was working on a &#39;cure&#39; for
mutants. Obviously the X-men disagreed with that and
busted him out, not long before the Jean/Scott/Emma
situation blew up on them all.

With a sweep of his wings Archangel descended, Warren
Wothington the third giving them a charming grin as he
set his girlfriend down. Paige Guthrie was a newly
graduated X-Man under the name Husk, with the ability
to transform via shedding her skin.

Paige looked anxious as the long brown haired teen
said, &quot;I think Evangeline is on her way back. Should
we get the workers clear?&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Logan admitted after a moment, &quot;I think
even the most jaded worker is gonna freak on seeing a
real dragon.&quot;

They managed to get most of the workers warned before
the massive grey skinned dragon appeared in the sky,
sweeping dangerously low over them before settling
down in the back of the school. The young woman riding
the dragin dismounted before it changed, soon leaving
two women in the sunlight.

&quot;Thanks Marie,&quot; Evangeline Watson said as she took her
clothes from her partner and began to dress. Soon the
black haired woman was dressed like a executive or
lawyer, which was exactly what she was.

Marie D&#39;Ancanto smiled wryly as the brown haired woman
followed, &quot;You could have skipped the dive bombing. I
thought we were going to crash!&quot;

&quot;We had meters to spare,&quot; Evangelene said serenely.

&quot;Feet, maybe,&quot; Marie shook her head.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Logan was nearly smirking, &quot;how did it
go?&quot;

&quot;About how we expected,&quot; Evangeline shrugged, &quot;Scott
looked like he was sucking on a lemon when he got the
news.&quot;

&quot;Makes me wish I had been there,&quot; Logan sighed.

Archangel shook his head, his own feelings mixed. On
one hand he felt Jean had been badly treated, but he
also still counted Scott as a friend, no matter how
much of a jerk he had been towards her.

&quot;Miss Grey and the Professor are inside,&quot; Paige
informed Evangeline, &quot;do you need to check in with
them?&quot;

&quot;We probably should,&quot; Marie admitted.

Evangeline nodded, &quot;I suspect the Professor would like
an update too.&quot;

Meanwhile, within the school the mutant known simply
as Xorn walked the halls, his manner calm and
deliberate as two children ran up the hall at him.
&quot;Careful, students,&quot; the steel helmed figure cautioned
them gently, his eyes glowing with a unearthly light,
&quot;you don&#39;t want to run into anyone.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, sir,&quot; a new student named Chaotica apologized,
her body shifting slightly to match her emotional
state.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Xorn seemed to smile, &quot;just take
care.&quot;

He watched the two hurry off, noting that Molly was
showing better control of her tentacles, them he moved
on. Assigned to the special case students Chaotica and
Molly were among the dozen or so he oversaw, training
them both in their powers and in social interaction.

Raching his rooms Xorn opened the door then froze, his
eyes flashing. &quot;What are you...?&quot; he started to say.

Madelyne gestured, closing the door behind Xorn.
&quot;Hello Magnus,&quot; she said cheerfully, &quot;it&#39;s been a long
time.&quot;

Looking honestly perplexed Xorn said, &quot;Miss, I don&#39;t
know what you&#39;re...&quot;

Without a motion Madelyne mentally tore the helmet
off, revealing a very familiar white haired man.
Magneto looked young, somehow, and shimmered with
power as he glared up at her indignantly. Calmly she
returned the helmet, &quot;Here.&quot;

&quot;You fool,&quot; Magneto pulled the helm on, &quot;without this
Xavier might sense me.&quot;

Madelyne smiled comfortingly, &quot;Magnus, it&#39;s all right.
I&#39;ve shielded this room descretely, there is no way
Xavier or Jean can sense us.&quot;

Magneto studied her a moment, &quot;So, what do you want
from me, Pryor?&quot;

&quot;Madelyne, please,&quot; she corrected him. She smiled
sadly, &quot;You know, I would have thought you&#39;d learn
your lesson by now.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Magneto asked.

&quot;You&#39;re taking your special class and training them to
be a new Brotherhood,&quot; Madelyne said calmly, &quot;but you
know it isn&#39;t going to work. Why keep doing it?&quot;

Magneto scowled up at her, &quot;It WILL work this time!
When I launch my sneak attack within the X-Men, they
will fall!&quot;

&quot;Do as you wish,&quot; Madelyne said with a shrug, &quot;but
Jean and Scott are mine.&quot;

&quot;No, I can&#39;t let them...&quot; Magneto staggered suddenly,
trailing off.

&quot;I just telekinetically cut off the blood to your
brain,&quot; Madelyne said conversationally. She released
him a moment later, &quot;Don&#39;t try anything, I can easily
shield myself.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t be controlled by you,&quot; Magneto growled.

Madelyne shook her head, &quot;It&#39;s not control, just a
warning.&quot; Her expression darkened, &quot;If you interfere
with Jean or Scott, I will kill you.&quot; She seemed to
fold in on herself, teleporting out before Magneto
could even react.

Resealing his helmet &#39;Xorn&#39; thought, &#39;She&#39;s clearly
become very powerful, possibly stronger than when she
was using a Phoenix fragment. But how? Why?&#39;

Hurrying from his room Xorn saw Xavier and Jean
hurrying up the hall. Charles looked concerned as he
said, &quot;I felt a odd ripple in the astral plane near
here...&quot;

&quot;It might be my fault, Professor,&quot; Xorn lied smoothly,
&quot;I was experimenting on turning my powers inward
earlier.&quot;

&quot;I suppose that might do it,&quot; Jean conceded after a
moment.

&quot;I&#39;ll desist from such experiments,&quot; Xorn added
politely.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; the Professor said, though he continued
to bear a thoughtful expression as they walked away.
