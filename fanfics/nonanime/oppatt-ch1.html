<pre>&quot;Hey, Lila!  Wait up!&quot;  Sixteen-year-old Lila turned her head to the 
sound of the unusually cheery voice of Helga.  It was Friday afternoon 
and school had just ended.  Lila stopped by her locker and smiled 
brightly.  Helga stopped afew feet away from the used-to-be country 
girl, taking a breather.  Lila had grown her hair longer and no longer 
wore braids.  They were straight and flew past her shoulders.  She 
wore a cute green miniskirt.  Helga had outgrown her pigtails and now 
wore her hair in one long ponytail.  She wore a pink T-shirt, jeans 
and sneakers.  She looked up to admire Lila&#39;s pretty clothes.

Ever since Lila and the other girls met she had been hanging around 
with them more often starting junior high.  The image of that time 
when Helga and the others totally humiliated Lila in front of the 
entire school had never left Helga&#39;s mind.  Although she had forgave 
them all, she still couldn&#39;t help but feel guilty.  It took this long, 
but she had finally sensed her opportunity to spend more time with 
Lila alone.  She was still in love with Arnold, but she didn&#39;t have 
the nerves to tell him.  She barely saw him that much, and remembered 
that time when she told Lila the truth.  She wanted to know if she had 
kept it a secret like she promised to seven years ago.

Helga began to feel nervous, putting her right hand behind her head 
and looking down, away from Lila&#39;s pretty smile, while struggling to 
find the right words to say what she had been practicing at home.  
&quot;Um.....hey, Lila?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;  Lila asked in her usual sweet voice. It made the tough girl 
feel soft inside.  She decided to give it up until she noticed Lila 
was holding her textbooks.  &quot;Oh, here, let me hold them for you!&quot; she 
said quickly, smiling at this chance to regain her confidence.  &quot;Oh, 
Helga, you don&#39;t have to.....&quot;   &quot;I insist.&quot;  Helga practially grabbed 
the books away from Lila.

Lila looked on worriedly as the blond girl staggered a bit.  &quot;See?  No 
problem!&quot;  She flashed a big smile.  &quot;Um, Helga?  What did you want to 
tell me?&quot;  &quot;What?  Oh, yeah!  Listen, are you free this weekend?  
I....I.....&quot; the question had been weighing on her mind for a long 
time now.  She shifted the heavy books in her arms and swallowed hard.  
She closed her eyes and said, &quot;I want you to spend the night over and 
maybe.....maybe the weekend too.&quot;  She let out a sigh of relief.  
Silence.  &lt;There!  I said it!&gt;  She still had her eyes closed, waiting 
for a response.  She felt like there was a bomb and she was waiting 
for its explosion.

Instead a hand was gently placed on her shoulder.  She nearly jumped, 
dropping Lila&#39;s math book and it landed on her foot.  She cried out in 
pain, dropping the other books, holding her foot and hopping around.  
She immediately felt her face as hot as the sun when she realized what 
she just did.  She slapped her forehead and slowly expected Lila&#39;s mad 
expression.  Instead Laila was calmly picking up her books.

She didn&#39;t appear to be mad at all.  &quot;Oh, Lila, I&#39;m so stupid!  I&#39;m so 
sorry...I...&quot; she bent down and was about to pick up her science book 
when Lila&#39;s hand was already on it.  Helga took a moment to realize 
that the hallway was now completely empty.  It was already getting 
close to four.

She looked up and saw Lila&#39;s smiling face.  &quot;I would love 
to.....Helga,&quot; she answered, saying Helga&#39;s name angelically.  Hot 
blood rushed to Helga&#39;s face and she quickly turned her head.  &lt;Am I 
really doing this?  Why the heck is she making me feel this way?  I 
haven&#39;t felt like this since I met Arnold.  And she knows....she knows 
I love him.  But then....why is my heart pounding so hard?  I don&#39;t 
let feelings like these take control of me!  But.....it&#39;s Lila, not 
Arnold.&gt;

&quot;Helga?  Are you okay?&quot;  Helga slowly turned to Lila&#39;s concerned face.  
&lt;She&#39;s so pretty now.  I wonder why it took me this long to notice.&gt;  
Her eyes unintentionally moved down to Lila&#39;s body.  &lt;I....I have 
never felt this way towards another girl before....I....oh man.&gt;  She 
quickly slapped herself.  Shocked, Lila reached out her hand.  &quot;Helga!  
Why did you...?&quot;  Quick as a flash Helga hoisted Lila&#39;s books in her 
arms and said brightly, &quot;Awesome.  Because you see, my parents need to 
go to this beeper convention my dad is hosting that&#39;s out of town and 
they&#39;ll be gone for the entire weekend.  I didn&#39;t want to go, so, they 
said I could have someone over.&quot;

Before Lila could say anything else Helga continued.   &quot;I know what 
you&#39;re thinking.  You&#39;re wondering why I asked you and not Phoebe or 
any of the other girls.  It&#39;s just that...&quot;  She could feel her face 
getting hot again.  Her mind was reeling.  &quot;It&#39;s.....oh, how do I say 
this.....I want you to come over and spend the night 
because.....there&#39;s something I&#39;ve been meaning to talk to you about 
and.....I know how mean I was to you since we met and.....this is kind 
of about Arnold.....I.....I want you only.....&quot; &lt;Ack!  That didn&#39;t 
come out right!&gt;  She stood frozen.

Lila looked at her for a moment, then she smiled.  She walked up to 
Helga and asked, &quot;When?&quot;  Helga made eye contact with her.  &quot;Right 
now,&quot; she responded coolly.  Lila was stunned.  &quot;Oh, but I need to ask 
my dad and.....&quot;

With a clever smile Helga flipped out her new cell phone.  &quot;Not a 
problem.&quot;

It was a beautiful sunny afternoon.  The sky was turning a bright 
orange.  The city was quiet for once.  As the two girls walked side by 
side, Helga took a moment to gather her thoughts together, holding 
Lila&#39;s textbooks as well her own backpack.  &quot;Helga, you really don&#39;t 
have to do this for me.&quot;  Helga laughed and shook her head.  &quot;Relax, I 
want to do this.  You know, you really ought to lighten up more, Lila.  
I know you and I are going to have a fun time together and.....&quot;

Suddenly a young thug appeared in front of them from an alleyway.   He 
appeared to be younger than the girls, wearing dirty clothes and had a 
smirk on his face.  &quot;All right, you two, hand over your money if you 
don&#39;t want to get hurt!&quot;  He had no weapons in his hands and he raised 
his arms like he was about to pounce them.

There was no one else around.  Lila was shocked.  Helga simply cocked 
her eyebrow.  &quot;Listen, you little punk, it&#39;s kids like you that people 
like me are around,&quot; she said calmly.  The kid just laughed and 
pointed at Helga.  &quot;Oh, are you trying to scare me?  What could a girl 
like you do?&quot;  He laughed even louder.

Laila could tell Helga was really mad, a heated aura around her.  She 
turned to Lila and said coolly, &quot;Lila, do this for me and I promise 
I&#39;ll return the favor.&quot;  As Lila held her books and Helga&#39;s textbook, 
Helga gave the kid a look that could have frightened off a dozen other 
boys his age.  Lila watched as Helga gave the kid a very serious 
beating.  For a while she had to turn her face, not bearing to look.  
When it was over, the kid ran off, crying, with a black eye.  Helga 
stretched her arms out and smiled.   &quot;Ahhh......that felt so much 
better.  OK, Lila, let&#39;s head......&quot;

She stopped when she saw that Lila was crying.  &quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;  
Lila didn&#39;t answer.  She simply lowered her head, her tears dropping 
on the concrete.  Helga scratched her head, trying to figure out what 
to do next.  Sighing, she held Lila&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;Hey, it&#39;s okay.  If 
I hadn&#39;t done something that little punk would have tried to hurt you.  
And you know I would never allow anything to hurt my friends.&quot;  Lila 
raised her head and looked at Helga.  &quot;I.....I&#39;m your friend?&quot;  Helga 
was surprised.   &quot;Of course you are.  You&#39;re one of my best friends.  
How could you not be?  Now come on.  My parents should have left 
already and it&#39;s getting darker.&quot;

Lila wiped her tears away and smiled.  &lt;So she does care for me after 
all.  I wonder what she&#39;s going to do to return that favor.  She 
certainly isn&#39;t as violent as she used to be back in the fourth grade.  
I wonder....I wonder what the real reason is that she asked me over 
the others.&gt;

&quot;You can wear my other pajamas and first thing tomorrow we&#39;ll go to 
your place and pick up your other clothes.  You have everything you 
need right here,&quot; Helga said happily, glad that it was just the two of 
them.  As Lila settled in Helga&#39;s room, she sneaked out into the 
hallway, leaning her back against the wall.

&lt;What&#39;s going on here?  Why am I acting like this?  When....when I 
beat up that little punk in front of her.....it was for her.....I was 
defending her.....it wasn&#39;t just for myself.....it&#39;s because I cared 
for her.....I didn&#39;t want anything bad happen to her....why is it that 
every time she&#39;s around I suddenly feel calm and peaceful?  It&#39;s like 
whenever I&#39;m near Arnold, yet I always end teasing him and walk off.  
But with her....it&#39;s different.&gt;  She carefully peeked inside and 
watched as Lila took off her jacket, unaware that she was being 
watched.

&lt;Man, she&#39;s so pretty.  Even after what we did, she still forgave us 
just like that.  So forgiving......so kind.....so caring.....the 
opposite of me.  Why is she having this effect on me?  &quot;Little Ms. 
Perfect&quot;.....yeah, that was her fourth grade title.  But she never let 
it affect her.  She&#39;s always been the same.  Honest.  Sincere.  
Helpful.  I.....I have never met someone like her before.  She even 
liked Arnold but...only as a friend.  So why.....why am I feeling like 
this towards her?   Me, Helga G. Pataki......interested in another 
girl.  That&#39;s not like me at all!  But....we&#39;re in high school now.  
Weird.  No matter what happened I could never hurt her again.  I was 
always the tough girl.  I could easily scare off any boy who ever 
crossed my path.  But she......she changed all that.  Violence is 
never the answer....she taught me that even I never told her that....I 
just.....I just want to be with you, Lila.  You&#39;re different from the 
others.&gt;

&quot;Helga?&quot;  Lila&#39;s sweet and polite voice broke through Helga&#39;s 
thoughts.  &quot;What?  Oh, sorry.  I was just thinking.  Hey, I&#39;m 
starving.  Let&#39;s eat!  You&#39;re going to love what we&#39;re going to have 
tonight.....&quot;

During dinner, the two girls ate quietly.  &lt;She really is my opposite.  
So tough and bold.  She always did let her fists do all the talking.  
But now.....she&#39;s different.  She really does care about me.  She 
wouldn&#39;t let that boy hurt me at all.  I wonder.....I wonder if this 
is more than just about Arnold.  She must have invited me because she 
wanted to show that she&#39;s truly sorry for what she and other girls did 
to me.  I&#39;m not mad about that anymore......I just couldn&#39;t reject her 
invitation.  We&#39;re friends, after all.&gt;  Lila thought to herself.

&quot;Relax, you look fine!&quot;  Helga said for the third time as she looked 
at Lila who was wearing Helga&#39;s pink floral patterned pajamas.  Lila 
felt a little embarassed.  Helga herself was wearing her old pink 
pajamas that had no designs.  &quot;I....I didn&#39;t realize you had these 
kind of pajamas, Helga,&quot; Lila said politely, not wanting insult her.

Helga simply waved her hand.  &quot;You know, you really need to be more 
confident about things and speak up more.  &quot;You&#39;re starting to behave 
more like Phoebe, do you know that?&quot;  She gave Lila a disapproving 
look.  Lila was confused for a while, then she began to giggle.  Helga 
watched in wonder as her friend giggled.  &lt;My heart......it feels so 
warm.  It&#39;s because of her, isn&#39;t it?  It&#39;s her that makes me feel so 
light.  Weird.  It feels like when I see Arnold, but.......in a more 
relaxed sensation.  I don&#39;t feel so nervous anymore.  Does this often 
happen to girls when they&#39;re older?  That they begin to have feelings 
for other girls?&gt;

&quot;Oh, Helga, I&#39;m sorry but I totally forgot to call my dad and ask him 
to bring my sleeping bag.  I&#39;d be more than happy then to sleep on the 
couch.....&quot;

&quot;No need,&quot; Helga held up her hand.  &quot;You&#39;re sleeping with me in my 
bed.....no, wait...&quot; a sudden thought occurred to her mind.  She 
grinned mischievously.  &quot;I know, we&#39;re going to sleep in my parents&#39; 
bed.&quot;  Lila felt her heart jump to her throat.  &quot;Helga, are you sure 
that&#39;s a good idea?  I don&#39;t think.....&quot;

&quot;Oh, relax.  They won&#39;t care, and we&#39;ll fix it up so they won&#39;t notice 
a thing.&quot; Lila was still having second thoughts as Helga pulled her 
hand and guided her towards her parent&#39;s bedroom.

The bedroom was much cleaner than before.  The bed was huge.  A full 
moon shone through the window over the quiet city.  Lila sat on the 
bed, waiting for Helga as the city girl was in the bathroom.  She 
began to relax, her muscles loosening more.

&lt;This is quite a comfortable bed.  I really ought to be more grateful.  
She invited me over because she cares for me.  I like her, I really 
do.  There&#39;s something about her.  I wonder if she&#39;ll ever tell Arnold 
the truth.  I think by now she ought to have summed up enough courage 
to tell him.&gt;

Helga entered the room, closing the door behind her.  There was enough 
moonlight to light up half the room, so they didn&#39;t have to turn on 
any lights.  The sky was filled with stars.  Helga sat on the bed.  
Lila suddenly had a funny feeling in her stomach.  She looked back at 
Helga, the moonlight washing over the two girls.  Without saying 
anything Helga leaned in and kissed Lila passionately, pushing her 
tongue deeper within her mouth.  &lt;So soft.......so warm.....I wonder 
if she was expecting this from me.&gt;  Helga thought as she kept 
kissing.

After about a minute, they broke their kiss.  &quot;Helga.......why did 
you....?&quot;  &quot;I think you know.  I know you do, Lila.  Why I invited you 
when my parents weren&#39;t around.  This really isn&#39;t about Arnold.  
Well, it is, but.....it&#39;s also about you.&quot;

She was silent for a minute.  &quot;Lila.....I think.....I love you.&quot; Lila 
covered her mouth with her hands.  She was stunned.  &quot;Helga......oh 
Helga.....this is too sudden......I......I don&#39;t know what to 
say......I.....&quot;

Helga locked eyes with Lila once again.  &quot;Lila, I care about you a 
lot.  You.....you totally changed me.  I was a troubled kid before I 
met you.  And then there was Arnold.  No matter how many times I have 
tried, I could never confess to him.  And then I met you.  
How.......why.......why did it have to be you?!&quot; she began to cry.

&quot;Helga......I don&#39;t understand.  What do you mean?&quot;  She reached out 
and touched Helga&#39;s body.  Almost immediately Helga fell into her 
friend&#39;s embrace.  &quot;Don&#39;t you remember, Lila?  When we were doing the 
play on &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in the fourth grade.  You were the last 
girl I had tried to convince to give up the part as Juliet, but....you 
never did.....and then......I......I told you that the reason I did 
what I did was because.......&quot;

&quot;You secretly loved Arnold,&quot; Lila finished the sentence calmly.  &quot;I 
remember, Helga.  And you made me promise to never tell anyone else.  
I think I understand.  You were afraid I might have let it slipped 
out.  Oh, Helga.   You should have known by now that I would never 
break a promise, no matter what it is.  I know how much you love him, 
you still do.  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I......I also 
return the feelings.&quot;  She moved in closer, holding Helga even 
tighter.

Helga felt so guilty.  She couldn&#39;t believe she had suspected a sweet 
girl like Lila to ever break a promise, let alone what it was or how 
long she had made it.  She looked up at Lila.  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Lila.  I 
never meant to hurt you.  I was so insecure.  I was so stupid, a jerk, 
a.......&quot; but before she could finish she was interrupted by a 
passionate kiss from Lila.

When it was over the two girls looked at each other.  &quot;Lila.....I 
never told you how beautiful you were.  You&#39;re so forgiving, so 
sincere, so kind.....I love you so much.  I felt so guilty before 
because of how I treated you before.....&quot; she stopped before she 
reached the final decision.

&quot;Lila?&quot;  she asked softly.  &quot;Yes, Helga?&quot;  Lila&#39;s voice was reduced to 
a whisper.  &quot;There&#39;s something I have always wanted to do with you.&quot;  
Lila nodded.  &quot;I know, Helga, I know.&quot;

Clothes were soon discarded.  The two girls were kissing passionately, 
letting loose their passionate feelings for each other as they tongues 
wrapped around each other.  Helga broke the kiss and went straight for 
Lila&#39;s vagina.  Lila arched her back and moaned out loudly in 
pleasure.  Helga&#39;s tongue found her clitoris and she lashed her tongue 
deeper within, until Lila&#39;s body released cum.

&quot;Oh Helga!  That feels so good!&quot;  Lila moaned out even more as Helga 
continued licking her vagina, kissing and sucking it.  Helga reached 
out and squeezed Lila&#39;s breasts, causing her new lover to moan louder 
as jolts of pleasure surged through her body.  Helga placed her mouth 
on Lila&#39;s breast, sucking hard.  &quot;HELGA!&quot;  Lila could feel more 
pleasure down her spine as her eyesight became blurred, her body 
sweating profusely.

&quot;You like that, don&#39;t you?&quot;  Helga asked, breathing hard.  &quot;Yes, 
Helga, very much.  Please......I need more.....go on......&quot;  Lila 
stared up at the ceiling, eagerly waiting to be pleased more.  
Smiling, Helga grinded her hips and vagina against Lila&#39;s.  Both girls 
moaned out in pleasure.  Helga brought her hips down halfway at the 
same time Lila brought hers up, grinding against each other, 
triggering orgasms.

&quot;Ooooohhhhh, Lila!  That feels so good!  Oohhhhh!&quot;  Helga was 
practically howling, as she grinded faster and faster.

&quot;Helga!  Oooh yes!  More!   Oh!&quot;  Lila could feel all of her energy 
being drained.  She had a couple of really strong orgasms.

Helga kissed Lila extremely passionately before sucking on her other 
breast and sticking two fingers into the other girl&#39;s vagina.  &quot;Oh 
God!  Helga!  Oh God!&quot;  Lila had never felt such extreme pleasure 
before.  She couldn&#39;t believe Helga was doing this to her.  Lila was 
quickly losing herself in the intense pleasure she was experiencing.  
She spread her legs out wider as Helga continued to plunge her fingers 
deep into her clitoris until her vagina was completely wet.  Licking 
her lips Helga licked and sucked her vagina dry.  She stick her 
fingers deep into Lila&#39;s vagina again, and this time, bringing them up 
to Lila&#39;s mouth, let her taste herself.

Breathing heavily, Lila sat there dazed.  Helga gently kissed her new 
lover&#39;s neck all the way down to her shoulders.  She whispered in her 
ear, &quot;I had wanted to do this with you before Arnold.  I love you, 
Lila.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need to worry about that.  I can tell you&#39;re still too 
scared to confess to him.  I love you too, Helga,&quot; Lila spoke softly 
as she massaged and squeezed Helga&#39;s ample breasts.  Helga let out a 
soft moan.  &quot;Helga.....let me.....it&#39;s my turn to please you.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Lila.  You deserve a turn too,&quot; Helga practically 
whispered.  Helga laid down as Lila kissed her neck down to her 
stomach.  She placed her mouth on Helga&#39;s breast, licking softly and 
sucking in between.  Helga moaned in pleasure, her breath coming in 
short gasps.  Lila kissed her thighs and licked at her vagina, 
returning the pleasure.  &quot;So....this....is.....the favor.....you 
were......thinking of....&quot;  she said in between kisses.  &quot;You catch on 
fast.&quot;  Helga mused.  Gaining her strengh back, she pulled Lila close 
to her and kissed her hard.  She felt Lila break the kiss, and then 
she felt intense pleasure shoot through her body.  Lila touched 
Helga&#39;s clitoris with her tongue, which was more than enough for Helga 
to let out a loud cry.  &quot;Oh God, Lila!  Oh yes!  More!&quot;

She began to thrash around as Lila sucked on her clitoris more.  This 
was too much for Helga to handle.  She could feel her entire insides 
exploding with pleasure, her mind feeling like fireworks and 
malfunctions.  She had lost all reason and logic.  Another intense 
orgasm caused her to scream.  Finally she fell back on the bed.

Lila crawled next to her, reaching out and pulling her close. They 
locked eyes, their breathing returning to normal, their bodies 
cooling, their heart rates returning to normal.  &quot;Lila.......that 
was......so incredible......I never........felt so good.....in my 
life,&quot; Helga said in between breathes.

Lila simply smiled.  &quot;I&#39;m......so glad......that I could......return 
the favor,&quot; she responded, her voice very soft.

&quot;Helga?&quot; she whispered.

&quot;You know that you could always count on me whenever you have another 
breakdown with Arnold.  I don&#39;t ever want to lose you, even if one day 
you do confess to him.&quot;

Smiling, Helga kissed her friend deeply.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry.  No matter 
what happens between me and football head, I&#39;ll always love you.  What 
you did for me tonight.....I could never forget that.&quot;

Nothing else was said as both girls fell asleep into each other&#39;s 
arms.
