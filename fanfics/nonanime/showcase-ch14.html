Scandal Savage leapt with unearthly grace, her black
and silver costume hugging her body as she went up
over the wall. She scanned her surroundings warily as
she hit the grass, eyes narrowed, then nodded slightly
as she reported, &quot;We&#39;re clear.&quot;

&quot;I should hope so,&quot; Lady Quark said coldly, the white
haired young woman flying over the wall beside her,
her bodysuit shimmering with unearthly energies. She
was an exile from a dead world, once a queen and now a
refuge, but still driven by her sense of nobility and
honor.

Knockout leapt down beside Scandal, the taller woman
giving Quark a fierce frown. &quot;A bit more respect to
Scandal, please,&quot; she said, red hair flowing down over
her back, a green costume and domino mask covering her
body.

&quot;Easy love,&quot; Scandal put a gentle hand on Knockout&#39;s
arm.

&quot;You know, one of these days I&#39;m going to try and
sneak a camera into your bedroom,&quot; Deadshot said
calmly, dropping down beside them. There had been a
Deadshot with the Secret Six for years, ever since
Mockingbird first formed the squad, but this latest
incarnation was a mystery. All most of the team knew
was that he wore the red and silver costume of
Deadshot and, oddly, was fiercely loyal to Scandal.

&quot;And I&#39;d break your back once I found out,&quot; Knockout
joked.

&quot;You two worry me at times,&quot; Huntress commented
mildly. Lian Harper wore a simple red costume, styled
after Green Arrow and Arsenal&#39;s costumes, the lady now
in her late thirties. &quot;So what&#39;s next?&quot; she asked.

There was a rustling sound as grass and vines twisted
and pulled together, a body swiftly forming to look
like a woman, roses granting the illusion of red hair
over the green skin. &quot;What&#39;s our objective, Scandal?&quot;
Dryad asked.

&quot;Oracle has a job for us,&quot; Scandal said simply, &quot;it
seems that someone claims to have the technology
belonging to Prometheus, as well as several major
artifacts. She wants them recovered or destroyed,
whichever is easier.&quot;

&quot;Prometheus?&quot; Deadshot kept a wary eye out as he
continued gruffly, &quot;He was the guy who took out the
whole JLA that time, right?&quot;

&quot;He would be a worthy foe, then,&quot; Lady Quark noted
thoughtfully.

Silently and stealthily they moved from the outer
perimeter wall, cutting across the massive property on
the edge of Coast City. While it looked like a
ordinary mansion the entire property was littered with
security devices, from motion sensors to thermal
imaging, and one by one they neutralized them and
moved on.

&quot;Are we dealing with a paranoid?&quot; Knockout whispered,
crushing a remote controlled security drone in her
hand.

Huntress tapped her wristband, accessing the Oracle
network. &quot;According to this the property belongs to
Carol Ferris,&quot; she noted as they crouched within sight
of the main building, a California style mansion, low
to the ground and rambling outward,

&quot;Star Sapphire...&quot; Scandal murmured.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Deadshot asked.

&quot;Rumors were that she was the Green Lantern villain
Star Sapphire,&quot; Scandal said thoughtfully, scrolling
through additional data on her Oracle link.

&quot;So this is a trap?&quot; Knockout asked. She only sounded
curious, not worried, knowing that they&#39;d gotten out
of worse scrapes before.

&quot;Oracle&#39;s never deliberately sent us into a trap
before,&quot; Dryad pointed out.

&#39;There&#39;s always a first time,&quot; Lady Quark said darkly.

&quot;The only way to know,&quot; Deadshot said simply, &quot;is to
go in. I volunteer, of course.&quot;

&quot;You really need to get over that deathwish,&quot; Huntress
said to him dryly.

Scandal just ignored that interchange, instead looking
over at Dryad. &quot;Can you get in?&quot; she asked her softly.

Dryad closed her eyes, reaching out with perceptions
that were very different than human ones. &quot;Yes,&quot; she
confirmed, &quot;there&#39;s plants inside.&quot;

&quot;Go,&quot; Scandal ordered.

Dryad seemed to unravel, the plant matter that
composed her returning to the earth itself even as she
consciousness reached out...

... to a lily in it&#39;s pot. The stone shattered as the
plant rapidly expanded, dissolving the rock as it
absorbed nutrients to swell out into a similar copy to
the Dryad who had stood outside, lily&#39;s as her hair
rather than roses. Gracefully she walked to the
window, checking for security devices before sliding
it open.

&quot;All clear,&quot; Dryad said calmly. She frowned slightly,
&quot;There&#39;s much less security in here compared to the
outside.&quot;

Huntress had her bow ready, a arrow on the string
almost as soon as she climbed in. &quot;Then there&#39;s
probably human guards,&quot; she said warily.

Scandal accessed the Oracle network as she took her
place just behind them. &quot;The network is surprisingly
mute on the subject,&quot; she said mildly.

&quot;Why am I not surprised?&quot; Knockout asked, looking
around warily as she moved protectively to Scandal&#39;s
side.

&quot;Easy, beloved,&quot; Scandal rested a hand on her
shoulder.

&quot;Let&#39;s find what we&#39;re looking for and go,&quot; Lady Quark
bitched, she and Deadshot following them in. As a
group they moved forward through the eerily quiet,
well decorated home, a place with an odd feeling of
neglect.

&quot;Dust,&quot; Deadshot murmured as he ran a finger on a
dresser, the air stale and dead.

&quot;The lily was nearly all dried out,&quot; Dryad noted, &quot;I
had to suck moisture out of the air just to make it
grow.&quot;

&quot;So why was the place abandoned?&#39; Huntress asked as
they found the concealed door in behind a book case.
The map Oracle provided them was perfect, as usual,
but she couldn&#39;t shake a feeling of unease about this
job.

&quot;Good question,&quot; Scandal pressed a switch, the door
chugging open slowly.

The shockwave of the explosion blew them back, but the
six responded like a well oiled machine. Lady Quark
threw out a energy bolt to counter and lessen the
blast even as Dryad yanked plant matter from the
earth, forming a shield. Dead shot and Huntress took
up firing positions while Knockout shielded Scandal,
their field leader.

Knockout smiled faintly, looking down at Scandal
fondly laying beneath her, &quot;This is almost
distracting, love.&quot;

Scandal surprised her by lifting slightly, pressing
their lips together. Then she was all business as she
demanded, &quot;Everyone, call out!&quot;

&quot;Here, but annoyed,&quot; Quark growled.

&quot;Got clipped,&quot; Huntress admitted.

&quot;Burned,&quot; Dryad was not happy at all.

&quot;Alive,&quot; Deadshot almost sounded disappointed, &quot;but
we&#39;ve got company.&quot;

Scandal blinked as she saw the purple clad woman, a
gem shining in her brow as long brown hair fell around
her. &quot;That&#39;s Star Sapphire, all right,&quot; a movement of
her wrists unfolded the weapons on her arms, the
Lamentation Blades.

&quot;What are you doing in my home?&quot; Sapphire demanded,
floating a foot above the ground.

Scandal held up a hand to hold her comrades back,
noting that Deadshot, Huntress and Lady Quark were all
ready to jump the woman. &quot;We&#39;re here for the weapons
you&#39;ve acquired,&quot; she said simply, &quot;such as
Prometheus&#39; helmet.&quot;

&quot;Are you more fools from the Injustice League?&quot;
Sapphire asked coldly.

Huntress raised a eyebrow, &quot;They&#39;ve been busy.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Scandal said firmly, &quot;you could say we&#39;re
subcontracting for the other side.&quot;

Sapphire hesitated, floating there at the end of the
stairs, then she nodded slightly. &quot;Get them out of
here, then,&quot; she said coldly, &quot;and be glad I&#39;m letting
you leave with your lives.&quot;

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Deadshot muttered.

&#39;So what does Oracle want with these?&#39; Scandal
wondered a short time later as their transport soared
into the night. &#39;And do I really want to know?&#39;

To be continued...

Notes: The Secret Six have existed in various forms
over the years in DC Comics, but the latest was
introduced in Villains United, a six issue miniseries.
Scandal was revealed to be a lesbian in issue five and
being involved with Knockout in #6.</pre>
