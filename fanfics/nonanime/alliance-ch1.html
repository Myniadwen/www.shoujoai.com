<h1>In the Shadow of the Bat (part 1 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Batwoman swung over Gotham City, Kate Kane smiling to herself slightly 
as the red and black clad heroine made a final sweep of the city. &#39;Just 
need to check by Beacon Hill and I&#39;ll head for home...&#39; she mused.

A light flickered, then played across the clouds, a stylized black bat 
in a disk of yellow light. It shimmered on the clouds, bright against 
the darkness and a symbol of hope from the mny times it had shone from 
the Gotham City Police department.

Oddly, this beam was not coming from the Gotham police.

With a muttered curse Batwoman changed her course, feeling fairly 
certain who was shining that light. Swinging up to a park on the edge of 
Beacon Hill she was a newer model van waiting, a figure shrouded in 
strange mists standing nearby holding the powerful lamp. His clothes 
were a bulky trench coat and suit, a old fashioned hat just above a 
eerily faceless mask, all making up the man commonly called the 
Question.

&#39;Just the Question? So where&#39;s ...?&#39; Batwoman thought as she dropped 
down gracefully to the ground beside him. &quot;What do you want,&quot; she 
demanded in her coldest, old money voice, &quot;and where&#39;s Renee?&quot;

&quot;Right here,&quot; Question pressed a button on his large belt buckle, a 
different color gas sprayed out then he pulled free the faceless mask... 
to reveal a very familiar face.

&quot;Renee?&quot; Batwoman blinked at her in surprise, doing her best to avoid 
showing any of her confusion.

The black haired, dark skinned Renee Montoya smiled at her wryly as she 
tucked the unusual mask away in a pocket. &quot;Still getting used to that,&quot; 
she murmured, &quot;wonder how Charlie managed for so long?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Batwoman asked, feeling a mix of relief and annoyance 
at seeing Renee again. Of course she almost always felt mixed feelings 
around Renee, her ex-lover and the one that got away, so to speak.

&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Renee sighed, &quot;and not something we can go into 
now.&quot; She looked at Batwoman seriously, &quot;Last night, you hit a drug 
operation run by the Shark. How did you find out about it?&quot;

Batwoman frowned, wondering where this was going. &quot;I shook down one of 
the Shark&#39;s goons,&quot; she said, &quot;he spilled the beans.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I thought,&quot; Renee sighed. She met Batwoman&#39;s gaze, &quot;The 
truth is the goon you questioned worked for Thorne... they used you to 
hit a rival drug dealer.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Batwoman scowled, &quot;How do you know this?&quot;

Renee shrugged as she reminded her, &quot;I am a detective.&quot;

Batwoman clenched her fists as her thoughts raced, wishing that what 
Renee had told her wasn&#39;t true. Sadly, it all fit together too well, how 
easily the goon had broken, the detailed information he gave up to 
her... at the time it should have stank to high heavens, but she was 
just too eager to act.

Giving Renee a wary look Batwoman asked, &quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot;

Renee gave her a smile, the sort of one that had once caused Kate&#39;s 
heart to skip a beat. &quot;I want to offer my help in exchange for yours,&quot; 
Renee explained, &quot;I&#39;ll be your detective, and together we&#39;ll deal with 
bastards like Thorne.&quot;

Reluctantly Batwoman wrestled with the idea, but it did make a great 
deal of sense. &quot;All right,&quot; she said reluctantly, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Renee took something from the pocket of her overcoat and tossed 
it to Batwoman, &quot;I&#39;ll contact you when I know more.&quot;

Catching the small radio Batwoman frowned, &quot;What if I need to reach 
you?&quot;

Renee touched a control on her belt and gas swirled out, blinding 
Batwoman as her voice said, &quot;Well, that is... the Question.&quot;

Once the mist cleared Batwoman saw that Renee, the van and her 
improvised batsignal were gone, only the empty park left behind. With a 
scowl she took her grappling hook and line and sent herself flying 
between buildings, trying to see where Renee had disappeared to.

&#39;So,&#39; Batwoman mused as she reluctantly gave up the search and swung 
away from Beacon Hill a few minutes later, &#39;it looks like Renee and I 
will be partners again.&#39; A slightly grim smile tugged at her lips, her 
long hair flowing in the breeze as she thought wryly, &#39;I hope this goes 
better than our last partnership.&#39;

Once upon a time Kate and Renee had been lovers, a wild and dangerous 
affair that had gone on for months. In the end it had been both of their 
closets that had ended the relationship, though neither of them would 
have admitted it. Kate had gone on with her life, dating covertly and 
living the society life, but she had never forgotten Renee.

Swinging gracefully from one of the many gargoyles in the city Batwoman 
admitted to herself, &#39;I&#39;m looking forward to being with her again.&#39;

Meanwhile, Renee Montoya pulled the van to the side of the road, ducking 
into the back as she muttered, &quot;This outfit is going to take some 
getting used to.&quot;

Shedding the garb of the Question helped restore her curves, the padded 
clothes that Renee wore in her other identity designed to make her 
gender ambiguous. Renee wanted people to be unsure if she was the first 
Question or not, using the reputation of the Question to her advantage 
as she sought answers to her own questions.

In regular pants and a buttoned white shirt Renee returned to the wheel, 
thinking a moment of the woman she had just left behind. She was less 
sure about working with Batwoman than she had acted, and Renee still 
felt a odd stirring in her chest when she and Kate talked. Their past 
hung between them like a kind of ghost, a mass of regrets and what might 
have beens.

&#39;Speaking of regrets,&#39; Renee thought, pulling up her van to the 
restaurant that she hadn&#39;t seen in months. She parked the van and got 
out, checking her watch as she took a breath of the morning air as she 
checked her watch, &#39;She should be here soon...&#39;

Walking up the street in her cooks&#39;s uniform there was a spring to her 
step, a sense of simple happiness that the other woman carried. She was 
good looking though not beautiful in the traditional sense, but there 
was something about her that drew the eye.

&quot;Daria,&quot; Renee called, standing nervously beside her van.

&quot;Renee?&quot; Daria looked startled, and to be honest Renee couldn&#39;t blame 
her. It had been nearly a year since they had seperated, Renee&#39;s 
drinking and guilt having driven them apart. Now the other woman looked 
at her searchingly, &quot;Are you... all right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Renee felt more than a bit of guilt that she hadn&#39;t at least 
tried to contact Daria sooner. &#39;Of course,&#39; she thought wryly, &#39;for the 
last few months I&#39;ve been helping the Question fight Intergang, chasing 
down the Crime Bible around the world and generally living a odd life.&#39; 
She smiled tentatively, &quot;How are you?&quot;

&quot;Good, I&#39;m good,&quot; Daria smiled a bit uncomfortably. She fiddled with her 
white uniform then asked, &quot;Renee, what are you doing here?&quot;

Renee sighed, knowing that this moment was coming and that she had to do 
it. Mustering her courage she met Daria&#39;s eyes and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Daria blinked in surprise.

&quot;I really screwed up our relationship and I just wanted to say I&#39;m 
sorry,&quot; Renee said. &quot;I was a complete ass the last month we were 
together, and I can&#39;t blame you for leaving me, though I do hope you&#39;ll 
forgive me in time.&quot;

&quot;I knew how much everything with Detective Allen hurt you,&quot; Daria said 
gently, &quot;and I just wished I could have helped you more.&quot; A faint smile, 
&quot;Not to be mean, but you&#39;ve never been the apologizing type...&quot;

Renee smiled back, &quot;I&#39;m in AA, have been for a few weeks. One of the 
steps is trying to make amends with those you hurt... but I&#39;d have come 
seen you anyway, I think.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Daria said. She hesitated, &quot;I&#39;m seeing someone, Renee.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Renee nodded.

Daria frowned suddenly, &quot;How do you know that?&quot;

&quot;I asked around,&quot; a slight smile tugged at Renee&#39;s lips, &quot;you know how 
the grapevine works, Dee.&quot;

Daria chuckled softly, &quot;True.&quot;

Renee said quietly, &quot;I&#39;ve got to go, see you around?&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;d like that,&quot; Daria nodded as they parted.

End

Notes: This is based off events in DC Comics&#39; books Gotham Central and 
52, including the possibility that Renee is being trained as a new 
Question. The idea of partnering up Batwoman and Renee as crimefighters 
seems obvious, and I&#39;m intrigued by their past relationship as lovers, 
too. In Gotham Central Renee left her lover Daria on bad terms, so I 
wanted to resolve that in some form. May be continued...</pre>
