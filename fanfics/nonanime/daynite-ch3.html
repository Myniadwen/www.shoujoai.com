<h1>Day and Night (part 3 of 3)</h1>

<a href="../nonanime/daynite-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Goliath stood atop the stone walls of the castle, his handsome face 
thoughtful as he looked out over the clouds high above New York. At 
times he still found it strange, living in this era, but he had 
gradually come to adapt to it&#39;s many changes.

Hearing a movement nearby he turned slightly, his lips lifting in a 
slight smile of welcome. A smiling Eliza Maza walked along the 
battlements, looking rather out of place dressed in her modern street 
clothes. Still, she was a familiar sight to Goliath as well as a good 
friend to him and his clan.

&quot;I didn&#39;t notice the others,&quot; Eliza noted, her long black hair 
fluttering in the breeze as she zipped up her jacket, &quot;are they out on 
patrol?&quot;

&quot;Hudson is leading them tonight,&quot; Goliath acknowledged, &quot;I&#39;m hearing 
rumblings of a new Pack.&quot; He shrugged slightly as he confessed, &quot;I&#39;d 
like to trust that Xanatos&#39; intentions are good, but our experience says 
otherwise.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not his biggest fan, either,&quot; Eliza agreed wryly. They stood 
together a moment, looking out over the city as she added, &quot;I had a talk 
with Owen, too.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Goliath raised a eyebrow questioningly. Owen was Xanatos&#39; primary 
employee and second in command, in charge of handling many of his 
company&#39;s day to day affairs. He was also Puck, a son of Oberon and a 
being of power himself as Goliath and the others had discovered to their 
regret.

Eliza smiled as she explained, &quot;Apparently Fox went to see Demona. She&#39;s 
hoping to broker a truce between her and the clan.&quot;

Goliath looked down at her in surprise. &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; he conceded, 
&quot;but would she really be willing to?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s worth a shot, I think,&quot; Eliza grimaced slightly as she added 
wryly, &quot;as long as it isn&#39;t me getting shot.&quot; Demona had sensed the 
closeness between Eliza and Goliath almost as soon as they met, and her 
jealous rage had nearly killed Eliza several times. Any peace between 
them would have to deal with that, too.

&quot;She will not harm you,&quot; Goliath vowed. &quot;That, I promise you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, big guy,&quot; Eliza smiled back. Moving closer she gently tugged 
him down into a lingering kiss. Pulling back only reluctantly she 
sighed, &quot;Gotta go. I&#39;m on shift in a hour.&quot;

&quot;Be safe,&quot; Goliath sighed as he watched her walk away.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Demona sighed happily as she crouched on top of the townhouse, her wings 
pulled in close to her body. It was such a relief to shed her human form 
and return to her true identity as a gargoyle. It felt better than 
shedding the business suits she wore during the day, and even better 
than those cinnamon treats that Alicia so liked to tempt her with.

&#39;Alicia,&#39; Demona bit back a surge of irritation at herself. Back in her 
gargoyle form less that a half hour and she already found her thoughts 
turning to the young woman/ She should be focusing on other matters, but 
somehow the girl intruded on her thoughts.

And in truth, Demona had something very serious to consider. Fox 
Xanatos&#39; visit had raised difficult questions for Demona, ones that made 
her examine her decisions more harshly than before. If she was truly 
committed to saving the gargoyle race, then their declining numbers 
meant she could no longer risk harming Goliath and the others. There 
were too few of their kind left as it was, they could not risk losing 
more.

With a soft snarl of frustration Demona extended her bat-like wings, 
thrusting powerfully with her legs and throwing herself up into the air. 
Her wings caught a updraft from the street below and she glided away, 
soaring on the warm winds of the city. With a almost supernatural ease 
she soared through the city&#39;s steel and concrete canyons, navigating the 
air currents with the skill of long practice.

A scuffle in a alleyway caught her eye, and Demona hesitated for a 
moment. &#39;Well,&#39; she mused as she shifted course, &#39;I could use a bit of 
exercise....&#39; With a roar she swept down, making the mugger leap back in 
alarm as she dove at him.

With a shaking hand he pointed the gun at her as he yelped, &quot;Stay back!&quot;

Before he could fire the gun Demona was upon him, slapping the weapon 
right out of the smelly man&#39;s hands. His battered clothing hung on a 
thin frame, and his eyes were wild on some kind of drug as he turned to 
try and run. &#39;No challenge,&#39; Demona sighed, casually knocking him out 
with a single blow.

&quot;Well, lass,&quot; a surprisingly familiar voice drawled from up the alley, 
&quot;This is not what I&#39;d be expecting you to do.&quot; Demona turned as she 
faced Hudson, the old gargoyle looking at her thoughtfully, stroking his 
grey beard. Once the leader of their clan he had stepped down in 
Goliath&#39;s favor, becoming a trusted advisor.

&quot;Don&#39;t read too much into it,&quot; Demona said to him flatly, &quot;I was just 
out looking for something to do.&quot;

Hudson nodded gravely, his mostly bald head glinting in the street 
lights. &quot;Aye, I see,&quot; he said as the mugger&#39;s victim gawked at them a 
moment before fleeing the scene as fast as his feet would take him.

&#39;Your welcome,&#39; Demona thought wryly.

Hudson tilted his head to the side as he asked her casually, &quot;And will 
we be fighting tonight?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Demona smiled back slightly, &quot;I have no feud with you tonight, old 
gargoyle.&quot; She looked curious, &quot;And where are the others?&quot;

&quot;Looking into something for me,&quot; Hudson shrugged.

&#39;He doesn&#39;t trust me,&#39; Demona thought, &#39;not that I can blame him for 
that.&#39; Quite deliberately she turned her back to him and began climbing 
the brick wall, digging her talons in for a better grip, &quot;Good luck, 
then.&quot;

&quot;An&#39; to you,&quot; Hudson nodded as he left.

Standing on top of the building and watching him go part of Demona was 
tempted to follow him, but as she stood there she firmly quashed that 
instinct. If she wanted to maintain the peace between herself and 
Goliath&#39;s clan, she needed to avoid antagonizing them. She thought for a 
moment of her daughter, Angela, then firmly quashed that emotion. She 
hadn&#39;t raised Angela, in truth she barely knew her....

Casting aside useless consideration Demona took off once more, letting 
warm winds carry her up through the air. She wanted to fly randomly, to 
simply soar over the city blindly, but without thinking about it she 
felt herself soaring down familiar roads to perch nearby her home.

Alicia Sevarius moved about her apartment, the beautiful blonde smiling 
happily as the bathrobe swirled around her. Her hair was damp from 
having been recently washed, and her movements had a cheery bounce to 
them. She carried a carton of Chinese take-out to a couch and plopped 
down, eating as she watched something on TV.

&#39;She&#39;s cute,&#39; Demona thought with amusement from where she crouched, 
gazing in at a life very different than her&#39;s. She had rarely worn 
anything so casual, not to mention having never tried take-out food. &#39;I 
wonder, would I understand humans better if I did?&#39; she thought to 
herself mockingly.

As Alicia turned in her seat she froze, her eyes widening. She walked up 
to the window, and Demona felt a sinking feeling as she realized the 
woman was staring right at her. &#39;She&#39;s spotted me?!&#39; Demona nearly 
panicked.

Alicia pushed open the screen door and stood on her porch, beckoning to 
Demona to come down. &quot;I wanted to thank you,&quot; she called.

Demona hesitated, knowing the wisest course would be to simply fly away. 
Still, she extended her wings and soared down across the gap between the 
buildings, carefully landing nearby her. &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Demona 
answered, glad that her voice was a bit grittier in her gargoyle form.

Alicia looked up at her, the blonde smiling slightly. &quot;I never really 
thought you&#39;d come over,&quot; she confessed. She laughed suddenly, &quot;I&#39;ve 
spent days thinking of what to say to you, but now my mind is blank.&quot;

Demona had to smile, careful not to expose her fangs too much. &quot;I&#39;m not 
too used to talking to humans, too,&quot; she conceded, realizing it was 
true. The last human person she had talked to in this form had been that 
damned Maza.

Alicia smiled, &quot;Do you want to come in?&quot;

Demona knew she should say no, that just being here talking to her was a 
bad idea. Yet surprisingly she answered, &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;
