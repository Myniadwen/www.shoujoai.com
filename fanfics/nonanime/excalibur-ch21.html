<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Jackie Crighton had to smile slightly as the white
haired young listened to Rachel&#39;s exciting story. &quot;I
almost can&#39;t believe that Mr. Wisdom had it in him,&quot;
she admitted, having changed out of the usual borrowed
X-men uniform and into more casual clothes.

Rachel and Kate sat together on a couch nearby the
fireplace in the common room, sharing some cocoa
before going to bed. They made an unusual looking
couple, the redheaded teen and the silver metal
skinned woman, but somehow they just fit. Jackie
watched them, largely uaware that her own expression
showed a mix of envy and regret.

Rachel chuckled, &quot;I know , Pete does spend a fair bit
of time smoking and complaining, but he was really
good out there.&quot;

&quot;Why were you asking?&quot; Kate asked curiously, the
living technology that made up her face tasking on a
curious look. She lookerd like a statue that came to
life,. coated in circuitry and wires, and it could be
just a bit unnerving to those who first met her.

Jackie felt a faint bit of color appear on her cheeks,
&quot;Just curious, I guess.&quot; She cleared her throat, &quot;Mr.
Wisdom is a interesting man.&quot;

There was a slightlly impish smile on Rachel&#39;s face as
she said, &quot;Yeah, I guess he is. It heps that he
doesn&#39;t much like talking about his activities in the
old days, too.&quot;

Kate snuggled there with Rachel, the two clearly
enjoying each other&#39;s presence. &quot;Has our resident mad
scientist made any progress?&quot; she decided to change
the subject, taking pity on the clearly embarased
woman..

&quot;Some,&quot; Jackie admitted as she drank from her own hot
cup of cocoa. &quot;It appears my body is storing up
thermal energy until it explosively releases,&quot; she
quietly explained, &quot;she thinks with practice I can use
it at will.&quot;

&quot;That would be helpful,&quot; Rachel noted. She studied the
white haired woman, &quot;I hesitate to ask, but do you
think you might be sticking around once your powers
situation is solved?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll be outstaying my welcome?&quot;
Jackie asked them with a charming sort of nervousness.

&quot;You&#39;ve fit in pretty well so far,&quot; Kate answered
Jackie firmly, &quot;and I&#39;m pretty sure Pete would be glad
to have you.&quot; She chuckled softly as she added, &quot;Not
to mention having more practical experrience than most
of us here.&quot;

Jackie considered a moment the smiled slightly. &quot;You
know, I think I&#39;ll go give Pete the good news,&quot; she
said, excusing herself.

&quot;Well isn&#39;t that intersting,&quot; Rachel finally murmured
after Jackie had gone.

&quot;Don&#39;t assume too much,&quot; Kate chided her gently. She
smiled as she continued, &quot;Just because she&#39;s curious
about Pete doesn&#39;t mean anything.&quot;

&quot;Still,&quot; Rachel smirked.

Largely unaware that she was the topic of amused
speculation Jackie walked the halls of the Muir Island
Mutant Research facility, first heading to the kitchen
to drop off her now empty cup then over to the command
center, the place that Pete was most likely to be
hanging out in between missions or if he hadn&#39;t
anything better to do. Sitting by the main computer
screen Pete was looking up at the image of Reed
Richards, thge two talking softly.

Reed, also known as the adventurer Mr. Fantastic and
leader of the Fantastic Four, had a faint frown on his
face, He wasn&#39;t the oldest looking man, though
premature grey lightened his temples, and his face was
still unlined. &quot;I&#39;m glad to say we&#39;ve dealt with the
security break that let Mouse hack into our systems,&quot;
he explained, blue jumpsuit crisply clean.

&quot;Did you figure out the problem?&quot; Pete asked, lighting
a cigarette.

&quot;The hackers used our link with SHIELD&#39;s computer
system,&quot; Reed said grimly, &quot;they have good security
but not up to the level the Avengers of Fantastic Four
have. I&#39;ve informed Nick Fury about it, and they hope
to patch the holes.&quot;

Pete nodded grimly, picking up his coffee and slurping
on it. &quot;Have you had any luck finding out what the
hackers got?&quot; he asked.

Reed brightened a bit, &quot;That I can help you with. Our
system logged the file sections they went for, I&#39;ll
email you a listing of what they got.&quot;

Pete nodded then took a bracing breath before he
asked, &quot;Anything major I need to be worried about
their having?&quot;

Reed hesitated, then with a sigh said, &quot;They accessed
genetic data that I compiled on Franklin, my son, as
well as Rachel Summers.&quot;

The look on Pete&#39;s face was priceless as he digested
that little piece of information. &quot;So whoever the
Marauders work for have the data on Phoenix and a
little boy who&#39;s powers are already right off the
scales...&quot; He visibly shook himself, &quot;You should know
that a police officer here will be contacting you, a
Dai Thomas.&quot;

Reed actually smiled wryly as he replied, &quot;I already
spoke to him by phone. He&#39;s a fairly unique person, I
think.&quot;

&quot;Good at his job, though,&quot; Pete replied. Noting that
Jackie was waiting nearby he excused himself,
promising to update Reed on any further developments.

&quot;Sorry for interrupting,&quot; Jackie said as she walked
over to his side, silently glad that the vents cleared
the cigatette smoke away.

Pete smiled up at her, &quot;Actually I&#39;m glad to be
rescued.&quot; He made a face, &quot;Richards is a good man but
I didn&#39;t need another techno-babble filled
explaination.&quot;

&quot;He does that often?&quot; Jackie asked, taking a nearby
chair.

&quot;The few times I&#39;ve met him on the job, yes,&quot; Pete
agreed. He crushed his cig out as he contrinued, &quot;So
what do I owe the pleasure of your company?&quot;

&quot;I was wondering if you&#39;d object to me staying on with
the team after Cecelia is done with me?&quot; Jackie asked
confidently.

Pete looked over at her in surprise then he visibly
brightened, &quot;Really? I&#39;d be glad to have you aboard,
Jackie.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jackie grinned.

&quot;You&#39;d better get ready for your teammates to start
dressing you,&quot; Pete said impishly after a few moments
thought..

Jackie blinked at him. &quot;Huh?&quot; she asked intelligently.

Pete grinned, &quot;You can almost be sure that someone,
probably Rachel, is going to be redesigning your
costume, now that you&#39;re staying on.&quot;

Jackie had to admit he had a point, especially
considering her usual red and gold costume dated back
to world war two. &quot;I hope they don&#39;t try anything too
radical,&quot; she sighed, &quot;I&#39;ve seen some of the X-Men&#39;s
costumes these days.&quot;

&quot;They aren&#39;t that bad,&quot; Pete said mildly.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen the White Queen&#39;s uniform,&quot; Jackie said
dryly.

Pete actually laughed, &quot;Okay, point. But I think that
she&#39;s a special case.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d say,&quot; Jackie chuckled. She studied him
thoughtfully a m,oment, &quot;At least you&#39;ve managed to
avoid wearing any costumes.&quot;

Pete snorted, then drank a bit of his coffee. &quot;Back
when I was in Excalibur the first time I told &#39;em that
I wouldn&#39;t wear one, thanks,&quot; he shrugged.

Jackie found herself saying, &quot;Oh I don&#39;t know, I&#39;d
think you&#39;d look pretty god in skin tight spandex.&quot; A
blush colored her cheeks and the white haired young
lady nearly clapped her hand over her mouth, she was
that embarassed.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Pete shook his head, &quot;I can&#39;t imagine wearing
that sort of thing in an English winter.&quot; He shuddered
visibly, &quot;A man could lose important bits.&quot;

Jackie chuckled softly.

Pete grinned back, his expression mostly impish.
Finishing off his coffee he said, &quot;You want to go see
if there&#39;s any leftovers from dinner?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like an idea,&quot; Jackie smiled as the two walked
out together.</pre>
