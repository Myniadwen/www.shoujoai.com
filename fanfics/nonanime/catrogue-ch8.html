<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Rogue drove the jeep, while Kitty took the shotgun seat. They cruised 
downtown for a while, both just enjoying the breeze blowing through 
their hair. &quot;Hey, there&#39;s a club we haven&#39;t visited,&quot; Kitty pointed.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Rogue smiled, turning into the parking lot. She jumped out 
first, then gentlemanly helped Kitty down.

&quot;You don&#39;t need to do that,&quot; Kitty said, sounding obviously pleased 
that Rogue was.

&quot;I may not have to,&quot; Rogue smiled, &quot;But I want to.&quot; Offering her arm, 
she and Kitty walked into the bustling night club together.

It was a fairly mixed crowd, men and women of various types at the 
bar, sitting at tables, or dancing. The music was pure pop, and a bit 
of smoke hung in the air. They both felt searching glances as they 
walked to the bar together.

&#39;I don&#39;t think I want to risk booze tonight,&#39; Kitty thought as she 
ordered a soda.

Rogue ordered a beer, producing a ID when asked, slipping it away with 
a smile. Carrying the two glasses, she led them over to a corner 
table, where they both settled down with the drinks.

Finally Kitty just had to ask, &quot;Was that a real ID?&quot;

Rogue just smiled mysteriously and drank her beer. She put her cup 
down and asked, &quot;Do you want to dance?&quot;

Kitty looked around them nervously, &quot;Are you sure that&#39;s a good idea?&quot;

Rogue shrugged, &quot;I think we can handle anything that comes up.&quot; She 
paused, &quot;And I guess I&#39;d like to be as open about loving you as I am 
about being a mutant.&quot;

Kitty sat silent a moment, absorbing those words. &quot;There are times 
when I wonder if you&#39;re not the smart one,&quot; Kitty finally said with a 
smile. She got up and offered Rogue her hand, &quot;Let&#39;s dance, then.&quot;

Just then, the radio started up another song, &quot;Hero&quot; by Chad Kroeger. 
The two young women swayed together on the dance floor as the slow 
song continued on.

Rogue held Kitty close, savoring the feeling of being with her. She 
looked over Kitty&#39;s shoulder, and nearly stopped cold as she saw who 
was coming. &quot;Kitty, is that who I think it is?&quot; she whispered in 
Kitty&#39;s ear, turning her so she could see.

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Kitty sighed, recognizing at a glance the Asian woman 
pushing through the crowd towards them. &#39;What&#39;s Lady Deathstrike doing 
here?&#39; she wondered.



Sage looked across the table at Heather Cameron, and found herself 
wondering what she was doing here. &#39;Because you were foolish enough to 
say yes when she asked you out,&#39; Sage thought to herself ruefully.

Heather tried not to smile at how nervous Sage was, sitting there. 
With a gentle smile, Heather asked, &quot;Have you ever been out with a 
woman before?&quot;

Sage was a bit startled, answering honestly, &quot;Yes, once or twice. 
Why?&quot;

Heather smiled slowly. &quot;I was wondering if you were just looking for 
someone to... initiate you, so to speak. Not that I&#39;d mind that very 
much.&quot;

Sage went beet red. &quot;I&#39;m not that inexperienced,&quot; she protested.

Heather suddenly smiled, &quot;Good.&quot; She looked at Sage across the table 
and asked her directly, &quot;Have you ever been in love before?&quot;

&quot;Once or twice,&quot; Sage answered, falling back on teasing to deal with 
Heather. &#39;She&#39;s so straight forward and brash,&#39; she thought.

Heather chuckled at that, &quot;Me, too. Unatainables, mostly people who I 
knew weren&#39;t really interested in me, or otherwise involved.&quot;

Sage looked across the table, suddenly struck by memories of the 
Professor. She nodded, admitting &quot;I guess I&#39;ve done that, too.&quot; Her 
eyes narrowed, &#39;Is that what I&#39;ve been doing with Storm, too? I knew 
she wanted someone else...&#39;

&quot;I guess it&#39;s safer,&quot; Heather nodded, &quot;no risk of rejection.&quot; She 
paused, &quot;I&#39;m trying not to do that anymore, so if you are unavailable, 
please tell me now so we can both bail out before any damage is done.&quot;

&#39;She&#39;s giving me a perfect way out,&#39; Sage blinked, &#39;tell her I&#39;m in 
love with someone else, and we&#39;re done.&#39; She looked across the table 
at Heather, opened her mouth to lie and said, &quot;I&#39;m free as a bird.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Heather smiled, gently covering Sage&#39;s hand with her own.

&#39;Why didn&#39;t I...&#39; Sage wondered, even as a odd warmth began to spread 
through her body at the touch of Heather&#39;s hand.



The hand landed on Kitty&#39;s shoulder, turning her about and out of 
Rogue&#39;s grip. &quot;Defend yourself,&quot; Lady Deathstrike said simply, the 
fingers of her other hand extending into claw-like blades.

Quickly Kitty offered, &quot;Let&#39;s take this outside, shall we?&quot;

Deathstrike met her eyes, then nodded slightly. &quot;Quickly,&quot; she said 
coldly, forging a path through the crowd to the doors.

&quot;What does she want with you?&quot; Rogue asked as they followed her 
outside.

Kitty sighed, &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to know.&quot;

The street was mostly deserted, the sun sinking away and leaving 
darkness behind it. Kitty took off her jacket to hand to Rogue, while 
Deathstrike dropped a cloak like coat to the ground. Her arms 
extended, all ten fingers stretching out into deadly blades.

&quot;What do you want, Deathstrike?&quot; Kitty asked, stretching her hands, 
rising up then settling down on the balls of her feet. &#39;This lady 
normally has a beef with Wolvie,&#39; Kitty thought, &#39;and had herself 
changed into a cyborg to take him on evenly.&#39;

&quot;I&#39;ve come to fight you, Shadowcat,&quot; Deathstrike said coolly. &quot;Other 
than that,&quot; she smiled, &quot;it really doesn&#39;t matter.&quot; With that, she 
leapt.

&#39;I could phase,&#39; Kitty thought in the moment she had before she 
reached her, &#39;it&#39;d fry every circuit in her cyborg body. But it could 
kill her, too.&#39; She moved smoothly, a half step and a strike, all in 
one motion. Deathstrike hit the ground with a very satisfying thump.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare play with me,&quot; Deathstrike snarled, pulling herself to 
her feet. &quot;Fight me,&quot; she demanded.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t dream of playing,&quot; Kitty said softly, taking up her stance 
again. Her eyes met Rogue&#39;s for just a second, silently telling her 
not to interfere.

Deathstrike leapt for Kitty, and this time Kitty met her mid-air. They 
tangled a moment, separated, then came together again in a blur of 
motion.

&#39;I can&#39;t believe this,&#39; Rogue thought, watching helplessly from the 
sidelines, &#39;Kitty isn&#39;t even phasing. She&#39;s keeping up with this 
psycho on pure skill alone!&#39;

There was a cry of pain, and Deathstrike staggered backwards, holding 
her arm as if it pained her. &quot;How?&quot; she asked hoarsely.

&quot;Some of the circuits pop up as you move,&quot; Kitty said, her guard 
clearly up, &quot;it wasn&#39;t hard to use your momentum to tear one free.&quot;

Deathstrike looked at her, obviously gritting her teeth at Kitty&#39;s 
calm analysis of the situation. With a incoherent cry she leapt, and 
Kitty was ready and waiting.



Ororo relaxed in Raven&#39;s arms, taking a moment to rest before they 
began again. &quot;Do you want something to drink?&quot; Raven smiled, getting 
up to pad towards the nearby phone.

Raven&#39;s blue skin was lightly furred, something Ororo had discovered 
was quite pleasant when they lay together. It thickened and thinned 
across her body, nearly completely gone someplace where Ororo expected 
to be visiting more than a few times tonight.

&quot;Two orange juice, please,&quot; Raven ordered, setting the phone down.

She looked over to where Ororo was stretched out on the sheets, 
looking for all the world like a jungle cat, lounging after the hunt. 
Her dark skin contrasted wildly with her white hair and blue eyes, 
making her terribly exotic looking.

&quot;Why juice?&quot; Ororo asked as Raven lay down beside her.

&quot;Well,&quot; Raven chuckled, &quot;we do have to keep your strength up.&quot; She 
kissed Ororo teasingly, adding &quot;Mine, too.&quot;

&quot;Was it as good as you hoped?&quot; Ororo asked Raven teasingly.

Raven seemed to give it a bit of thought, &quot;No.&quot; As Ororo began to look 
worried Raven smirked, &quot;It was better!&quot;

&quot;Why, you!&quot; With that, Ororo began to tickle Raven, and quickly 
discovered she was quite sensitive around the ribs!

&quot;He, ha ha, he, no! Stop that!&quot; Raven protested, tears in her eyes. 
Struggling, the two rolled on the floor, Ororo underneath.

&quot;Ow!&quot; Ororo protested, rubbing her bottom.

&quot;Oh, did that hurt?&quot; a worried Raven asked, then she smiled slightly, 
&quot;Do you want me to kiss it all better?&quot;

The waitress carried the tray with two orange juices to the door, and 
knocked gently. Receiving no answer, she pressed her ear to the door. 
She giggled softly, opened the door a bit and quickly sat the tray on 
the stand by the door.

She wasn&#39;t able to shut the door before hearing a sexy voice, &quot;Let&#39;s 
do that again!&quot;



Finally, she just ran out of steam. Deathstrike kept charging and 
attacking, all the while Kitty whittled away at her, little strikes 
that built up the damage on her opponent. Finally, she got tired and 
clumsy, and Kitty dropped her with a carefully placed blow.

As she struggled back to wakefulness, she heard them talking. &quot;Why 
didn&#39;t you phase?&quot; Rogue asked softly.

&quot;Because it&#39;d probably kill her,&quot; was Kitty&#39;s direct answer.

&#39;She didn&#39;t phase,&#39; Deathstrike realized, understanding that Kitty had 
defeated her by pure skill alone. She let them see that she was awake, 
and Kitty went on guard again. &quot;No,&quot; Deathstrike said, holding up her 
hand, &quot;you have beaten me honorably. It seems that all the stories 
going around about you are right.&quot;

&quot;Stories?&quot; Kitty asked.

&quot;Stories?&quot; Rogue echoed.

&quot;You defeated Vargas,&quot; Deathstrike shrugged, &quot;one of the greatest 
fighters in the world. A Hand master assassin has chosen to become 
your apprentice. The stories say that you are now the best, and it may 
even be so.&quot; With that, she was gone.

Kitty began to swear softly, even as Rogue looked at her in surprise. 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong? I thought you&#39;d be complimented,&quot; she said.

&quot;Think about it,&quot; Kitty sighed. &quot;Have you ever wondered why Wolvie 
gets into so many fights?&quot; she asked.

&quot;His wining personality?&quot; Rogue said dryly.

&quot;That, too,&quot; Kitty chuckled. &quot;But in the underground, he&#39;s considered 
to be the best there is at what he does. So if you want to be 
considered the best, you have to....&quot; she trailed off leadingly.

&quot;Beat him,&quot; Rogue finished. Her eyes got wide, &quot;But now Deathstrike 
says that the word is that you&#39;re the best now!&quot;

&quot;Which means all those wackos are going to start coming after me, 
now,&quot; Kitty said grimly. She sighed, &quot;I just hope she heard wrong, or 
something.&quot;
