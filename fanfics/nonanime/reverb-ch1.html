<pre>Jessica Jones hugged her husband, her brown hair falling into her eyes 
as she asked, &quot;You going to be okay with the baby?&quot;

Luke Cage nodded slightly, his eyes grave as the dusky skinned man 
answered, &quot;It&#39;ll be fine.&quot; They walked together to one of the doors to 
Dr. Strange&#39;s hidden sanctuary as he said, &quot;I can come along if you 
want...?&quot;

Jessica smiled up at him, placing her hand on his cheek. &quot;It&#39;s all 
right,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m a retired super hero, and a small fry. It&#39;d be 
bad publicity if Stark and his goons tried to snatch me up.&quot; She paused, 
&quot;Besides... I need to do this.&quot;

Cage hugged her again, gently, &quot;I know. Just be safe.&quot;

Jess didn&#39;t answer, instead gently kissing him goodbye.

Walking out of Greenwich village later that morning Jess hailed a taxi, 
carrying the bundle of wild flowers that she had purchased earlier. The 
cabbie seemed subdued as they drove, mentioning, &quot;Quite a crowd today.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d guess so,&quot; Jess agreed as they drove, looking out at the buildings 
going by them.

&quot;You a relative, or...?&quot; he asked, looking up at his rear view mirror to 
see her face as he drove expertly through the press of traffic.

&quot;Friend,&quot; Jess admitted as traffic began to slow. A few minutes later 
they were nearly crawling along and she sighed softly. &quot;Do you think I 
could get out here?&quot; she asked.

A bit disappointed at losing a bit more fare, he nodded. &quot;No prob,&quot; he 
eased them over to the side and rang up the fare. Handing her the change 
he hesitated then said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Jess agreed as she got out.

Lower Manhattan was a bustling place, cars driving and horns honking, 
but as Jess walked the noise seemed to fall away, gradually decreasing 
as she grew nearer to the spot. The massive damage had been mostly 
cleared, the land prepared and the construction of the Freedom Tower was 
ongoing, but to Jess this would always be one thing.

The site of the World Trade Center.

Like many of the people gathered today she walked in the area around the 
site, then went to a makeshift memorial someone had set up to one side, 
flowers and other items left there like they had in past years.

An older man set down a teddy bear, the animal cute in a rumpled sort of 
way. He felt Jess eyes on him and smiled slightly. &quot;My son was a fire 
fighter,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;he always liked these. I&#39;d buy him a 
different one every year.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s very nice,&quot; Jess agreed as she set the flowers down. She looked 
out over the hole as she said, &quot;My friend worked in one of the 
towers...&quot;

Giving her a kindly glance he asked, &quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot;

&#39;Did she?&#39; Jess wondered. &quot;She was a government officer...&quot;

What Jess didn&#39;t say, couldn&#39;t explain as she talked was the background. 
A lot of it was tied to the terrible time in which she had been 
recovering from mind control in SHIELD care, living on one of their 
bases and working with Jean Grey. In the middle of a doomed affair with 
SHIELD agent Clay Quarterman she had met her, working in the medical 
center.

Emily Jordan Keladry had been a medical tech at SHIELD when Jess was 
there, and they had struck up a friendship. Emily spent time with Jess 
in between treatments, brought her paperbacks and had been a much needed 
connection to a world away from superhumans, madmen and craziness.

After she left SHIELD care Jess lost touch with Emily, exchanging only 
the occasional phone call and letter. One of the last times Emily called 
she had been excited that she was coming back to New York. It seemed she 
was being transferred to a SHIELD monitoring station in the city, one 
based in the north tower of the World Trade Center.

&quot;What happened to your friend?&quot; he asked gently when she trailed off her 
edited account of their meeting.

&quot;I talked to a few witnesses after,&quot; Jess stuck her hands in her 
pockets, &quot;Emily didn&#39;t leave, she stayed to help evacuate others.&quot;

&quot;She sounds like a brave woman.&quot;

&quot;Yes, she was,&quot; Jess agreed, silently adding, &#39;and a lonely one.&#39;

When Jess was invited to her funeral by Clay she was shocked to see only 
a few SHIELD agents attending. It seemed that Emily&#39;s family were dead 
and she had been without romantic ties, driven only by her work. Talking 
to Clay and the others at a impromptu wake afterwards she was surprised 
to hear how important she had been in Emily&#39;s life, the woman even 
keeping a photo of her.

Now, each anniversary Jess came here to remember her, and to wonder what 
might have been between Emily and herself. If she hadn&#39;t been so wounded 
when they met, could that have had a deeper friendship? Had Emily hoped 
they could be more than friends? Jess Didn&#39;t know, would never know.

All she was left with was memories and regrets.

End

Notes: Emily is a creation of my imagination, assisted by the crew of at 
mediaminer dot org. Thanks for naming her, guys. My knowledge of New 
York geography is purely defined by books, so if I&#39;ve really blundered, 
let me know.</pre>
