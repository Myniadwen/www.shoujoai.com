<h1>Double Life (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/doublelife-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;So how&#39;d it go last night, Sam?&quot; Clover asked teasingly.

&quot;Um, what are you talking, Clover?&quot; Sam said startled.

&quot;Don&#39;t play dumb with me. I know you two snuck out last night.&quot;

&quot;What... you know?&quot; Sam asked stunned.

&quot;Of course we know, Sam, you couldn&#39;t have made it any more obvious. So 
did you kiss?&quot; Alex asked excitedly.

&quot;Yeah, I want to know all the juicy details. Spill it all for us.&quot;

&quot;Uhhhhhhhhhh..... I really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; Sam 
said strategically deciding to still dodge the issue.

&quot;Jeze, what&#39;s with you lately?&quot; Clover said getting sick of her 
evasiveness. &quot;You&#39;ve been acting so strange, Sam. You can&#39;t even tell 
your best friends in the world about your boyfriends anymore.&quot;

&quot;Oh, boy... friend.&quot; She made a fake sounding laugh. &quot;Yes, we, um, had a 
good time.&quot; Actually, Sam was a bit disappointed with Clover&#39;s comment. 
She wished breaking it to them would&#39;ve been that easy. They didn&#39;t seem 
upset.

&quot;What did you two do?&quot;

&quot;He took me dancing.&quot;

&quot;Awwww, how nice,&quot; Alex remarked.

&quot;I wish Chad would take me dancing,&quot; Clover said jealously.

&quot;So who is this mystery hottie of yours and when do we get to meet him?&quot;

&quot;His name is, Man...uel, yes Manuel, that&#39;s his name all right. He lives 
very, very, very far away. Like almost to Malibu. When he&#39;s not at 
school, he works almost all day, so I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll be able to 
see him much.&quot;

&quot;Wow, Sam. If that&#39;s true, than how did you two meet?&quot;

*bring!*

&quot;Not again!&quot; Clover and Alex both yelled as they scurried to get to 
their class.

Sam didn&#39;t follow them immediately. She looked around the hall way as it 
emptied out of familiar faces. However, she couldn&#39;t see Mandy&#39;s 
anywhere. It was very un-characteristic of her not to come and verbally 
trash them a few seconds before Science class. Sam had been looking very 
forward to just seeing her again, even if it was still under the 
pretense of a high-school rivalry. She finally walked through the door 
into Science class. Her elderly teacher was scowling at her as she 
walked in.

&quot;Samantha, Clover, Alexandria, I&#39;ve been permissive of your tardiness of 
late, but I&#39;m sorry it has gone on long enough. I&#39;m writing you all up.&quot;

&quot;Ohhhhh,&quot; Clover and Alex whined.

Sam just sat down and took out her note-book. She looked over at Mandy&#39;s 
seat. It was empty. She couldn&#39;t help but feel worried. Despite her 
previous notions of Mandy, her attendance record had been pretty near 
spotless. She seemed like she was in perfect health last night, so where 
was she? The lecture started and the teacher started rambling on about 
some dull topic. Sam tried to taking notes, but her mind began wandering 
again to Mandy, the things she had told her, and how much her feelings 
towards her had changed in the past few days.

Right in the middle of class, the loud speaker sounded off, &quot;Would Sam, 
Clover, and Alex please report to the principal&#39;s office. This is 
regarding your recent tardies.&quot;

All three shuffled their way out of the room and back into the hall way.

&quot;Great this is all I need, a detention,&quot; Clover complained.

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Alex agreed.

&quot;Hey you guys haven&#39;t seen Mandy today have you?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;No, I haven&#39;t seen her, Sam. I noticed she wasn&#39;t in gym today either. 
Maybe she&#39;s sick.&quot;

&quot;I hope it&#39;s the plague,&quot; Clover sneered. Alex snickered. Sam just 
ignored them.

Something just occurred to Alex, &quot;Hey if we just got our last tardies, 
than how come we&#39;re being called to the office before Mr. Lazarus could 
send them up?&quot;

&quot;Oh no, not again!&quot; All three girls screamed as a twister of water spun 
out of a nearby, abandoned janitor&#39;s mop bucket. The cyclone spun over 
and engulfed all of them into the twisting, soapy water. 
Incomprehensibly, they were now somehow falling down a metal corridor.

&quot;How do we fall for this everytiiiiiiiiiime?&quot; Sam screamed as she fell.

&quot;My designer original, it&#39;s ruined!&quot; Clover shrieked while crying.

All three of then lumped into a big wet, soaped up pile on Jerry&#39;s couch 
and a short water-fall followed them. They unraveled their selves from 
this provocative entanglement and sat down properly. A giant blow-dryer 
attached to a metal arm dropped from the ceiling and blew them dry with 
much force. All three girls then pulled out mirrors and brushes and 
attempted to fix their hair, after it had almost been blown off their 
heads.

&quot;Jerry, WOOHP&#39;s going to have pay for my dress and my hair!&quot; Clover 
griped.

&quot;That can be arranged,&quot; Jerry said sipping his glass of tea. There was a 
kettle of it on his desk.

&quot;I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t invite us here for tea-time, Jerry,&quot; Sam 
queried conversationally.

&quot;As much as I wish that were the case, sadly something else has come 
up.&quot;

The screen behind him switched on, there was a silver box displaying the 
words &quot;Please stay tuned shortly for an announcement regarding your 
impending doom.&quot;

&quot;For the past several minutes all the tv and internet signals on the 
planet have been jammed with this image...

Jerry shut up when the image switched to a video feed of Sebastian. He 
was sitting on a red, cushioned chair in front of a fake-looking fire 
place. Sitting in his lap were a large pair of garden shears.

&quot;Good evening planet Earth, or should I also say good morning to some of 
you. Please forgive me for not having subtitles available in 
three-thousand or so foreign languages, but you can manage. I&#39;m here to 
tell you a story, a story about a child. This child&#39;s birth name is 
irrelevant, so we will simply call him Sebastian. Sebastian was a child 
who once had a dream. That dream was to grow up to be the best lead 
guitarist in the world and create the greatest music rock and roll had 
ever heard. Growing up as a poor orphan Sebastian had little chance of 
achieving that dream since he had no money buy me a guitar. However, he 
averted this dilemma by pick-pocketing enough money to buy his first 
guitar. He still couldn&#39;t afford lessons, mind you, but over a series of 
years he painstakingly taught himself how to play. He kept improving his 
skills through out his youth, until he started reaching his full 
potential as a guitarist. His band played at small clubs and shows, and 
he began to reap the benefits of his hard work though the roar of the 
audience, critical acclaim from local journalists, and a measly, cash 
reward. Then one day after a performance, he was confronted by a man 
claiming to be an A and R for a major record label. He told Sebastian 
that he could be a millionaire, have more women than he could handle, 
and would get his music to millions of people across the world. While 
the two former promises were intriguing to his young mind, the later was 
the one he had always hoped for. He was signed and in their studios he 
began work on what he wanted to be the greatest album in rock history. 
Upon completing it, everyone who listened to the album agreed it was the 
best one they had ever heard. A single was chosen, and soon his band was 
put on the road to help promote the up-coming album. His label decided 
to better market his band, it needed more spectacle. So, elaborate 
costumes, stages, and pyrotechnics were added to his live show. 
Sebastian argued that his music would be enough, but since they were the 
ones who had the final say, he begrudgingly agreed. Apparently, they did 
not spend enough money on the pyro, because it malfunctioned during one 
of his first shows, and the young guitarist was sprayed with fire.&quot;

Sebastian raised his metal claw in front of him. His voice now fuming 
with anger, he continued, &quot;It destroyed my hand! I would never be able 
to play the guitar again. It also left my face like this!&quot; He then took 
the pair of garden sheers with his human hand and placed one blade 
behind the long, silver hair that draped over one half of his face. He 
took his claw and pressed the handles together, causing the blades to 
clip across the hair. The silver hair fell to the ground, and the hidden 
side of his face was revealed. It was hideously scarred beyond 
recognition due to burns and a deep, dark hole existed where once an eye 
had been.

&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot; All three girls screamed at this ghastly sight. Alex 
instinctively jumped into Sam&#39;s arms for protection.

&quot;I have kept one half of my face hidden from the world until today. I 
may have sued for compensation, but foolishly I had signed a contract 
that freed my label from having any liability for stage-related 
accidents. Once half my body was disfigured beyond recognition as being 
human, I was deemed to no longer be marketable in any capacity and was 
dropped. My master work was never released, and I had no ability to do 
so since I had also foolishly signed away the rights to my masters in 
the very same contract. Thankfully, I had made a few contacts during my 
short stay at the label, so after I grew back enough hair to hide my 
scars, I was able to re-invent myself as a producer. I thought since I 
would never be able to fulfill my dream to have the world listen to my 
music, perhaps I could help other artists do so. However, I quickly 
found my hard work was again being under-mined by music industry 
higher-ups who preferred substanceless glop aimed at a cross-over radio 
audience compared to real music crafted from skill, creativity, and 
passion. I begrudgingly went along with this commandment from the glass 
ceiling to make that kind of noise, but at the same time I had been 
experimenting with subliminal sound patterns that I learned could induce 
listeners to do things other than nod their heads. Soon I found I could 
implant this into the worthless records I was making and use them to 
control people. You may think the ones I should exact my revenge on 
would be the music industry swine who destroyed my life, my dream, and 
my humanity. While they are guilty, it became obvious to me they only 
existed because the mass public devoured whatever trash they put out 
like the mindless sheep you are. Without all of you, the corrupt music 
industry wouldn&#39;t exist. You are just as guilty for making me this way, 
as they are. For a while I was content with using your un-ending 
appetite for garbage to control you, but I&#39;ve recently realized what I 
really wanted to do all along was to kill you all. However, this time 
you will actually being hearing good music, since for the first time 
ever my debut album will be released to all of you absolutely free of 
cost. Well, in the monetary sense at least. I assure you, this will be 
the most expensive album you&#39;ve ever bought.&quot;

He finally stopped his tirade for a moment and looked more directly into 
the camera, &quot;And this is a message to the three, young spy girls who I 
know are watching. I have kidnapped your lesbian lover.&quot;

At that moment, the tea Jerry was drinking exploded from his mouth and 
sprayed against the screen. As the liquid slid down the screen, the 
camera panned over to Mandy who was still bound with ropes to her chair. 
Her right eye was black and swollen, and the right half of her face was 
badly bruised from the impact of Sebastian&#39;s claw. Her mouth was still 
gagged with the bandana. When she realized the camera was on her, she 
started making high pitched, muffled sounds frantically.

&quot;Mandy!&quot; Sam cried out.

Alex looked up at her friend&#39;s face and saw a look of deepest concern. 
Alex sometimes acted air-headed, but she was smart enough to put two and 
two together to realize who Sam&#39;s recent, secret love really was.

The camera panned back over to Sebastian, &quot;Cute thing, isn&#39;t she? If you 
want to see her alive again, you best hurry. She will be the first to 
die. And as for the rest of you, please stay tuned, because I know you 
will.&quot; The signal ended.

Unlike Alex, Clover was still completely oblivious, &quot;Great. Now he&#39;s not 
only crazy, but now he&#39;s a crazy perv. And why does he have to kid-nap 
Mandy? You think he could find someone who actually belongs on the 
streets.&quot;

Sam just ignored her. Alex looked back up at her. Sam took her hand and 
wiped away the tears from her eyes. She couldn&#39;t stand to see Mandy like 
that. On top of that, she felt responsible. No doubt, she was 
Sebastian&#39;s real target, and Mandy only got put in harm&#39;s way because of 
her. Alex watched as her face then turned to one of cold, determined 
seriousness. Sam knew she couldn&#39;t afford to make the same mistake 
twice. She had to handle this mission with her mind and her spy 
training. As much as seeing Mandy in that condition had pained her, she 
would have to control her emotions or she would be playing right into 
Sebastian&#39;s hand and wouldn&#39;t be able to save Mandy or anyone else.

&quot;Jerry, were you able to trace the signal?&quot; Sam asked him.

Jerry was distracted for a moment as he stared at Sam with Alex on her 
lap, before he cleared his throat. Alex got off and sat back down in her 
previous spot. &quot;Unfortunately, no. It appears the signal he used to 
transmit the broadcast was as untraceable as the one he used in those 
CDs you sent me earlier.&quot;

&quot;Could you replay the video?&quot;

&quot;Certainly.&quot; He worked at his computer for a second, and Sebastian&#39;s 
broadcast started playing again.

&quot;Fast-forward to the part right before the end, where he moved the 
camera and pause it.&quot; He did just that and it was now fixed on still 
image of the battered Mandy in bondage. &quot;Close in on the far right 
there.&quot; The screen panned in on a table in the background, and there was 
a small, potted cactus on top of it.

&quot;Keen observation Sam,&quot; Jerry said as he worked at his computer. 
&quot;According to WOOHP&#39;s database, that is a

Leptocereus Quadricostatus. A breed of cacti better known as the 
Pitahaya. It&#39;s native only to Puerto Rico.&quot;

Sam thought for a moment. &quot;Maybe Sebastian has taken over the Arecibo 
Observatory and re-configured it so he can disrupt the signals of 
satellites orbiting earth.&quot;

&quot;Whoa, whoa, wait up, you lost me,&quot; Alex said.

&quot;The Arecibo Observatory is located in Puerto Rico. It&#39;s the largest 
satellite dish and radio-telescope in the world. Astronomers use it to 
study objects in space,&quot; Sam explained to her.

&quot;Interesting theory, Sam. I&#39;m going to have to agree with your deduction 
and...&quot; Jerry&#39;s com-wallet went off. &quot;Excuse me for a moment.&quot; He put it 
next to his head. &quot;Yes... Yes... Oh my... Send the other the other 
victims to the infirmary immediately.&quot; He snapped his wallet closed, put 
it back in his pocket, and looked at his computer monitor for a few 
moments with serious expression on his face.

&quot;Girls, I&#39;m going to show you a surveillance video. This is of one of 
the victims of Sebastian&#39;s CDs you investigated the other day. We had 
placed him in an isolation room for observation.&quot;

The giant screen than changed to the view from a camera placed on the 
wall of a white room. It was the first man they had investigated when 
this mission began. He was still screaming to himself, &quot;What! What! 
What! What!&quot; Then his whats became more frequent, with him screaming 
faster and faster. &quot;What! What! What! Wha! Wha! 
WhaWhaWhaWhaWhWhWhWhWhWh!&quot; His head started vibrating rapidly and Jerry 
pressed a button to pause the image.

&quot;To save you from the grisly imagery, I&#39;ll just say he lost his head.&quot;

&quot;Ewww gross!&quot; All three girls said.

&quot;Since time is of the essence, I&#39;m going to assume the gadgets you 
already have will be sufficient. You&#39;ll also being flying to Puerto Rico 
via cruise missile.&quot;

&quot;Wow, nostalgia trip, Jerr,&quot; Clover said with little enthusiasm.

&quot;But I don&#39;t want to take this nostalgia trip!&quot; Alex whined.

&quot;You have no choice. Good luck and be careful ladies, the world is 
counting on you.&quot;

&quot;Ahhhhh!&quot; They were all sucked into a compartment that opened in the 
wall.

A computer voice started counting off, &quot;5, 4, 3, 2&quot;

They started scurrying around frantically. Alex yelled, &quot;Hey, where are 
the seat-belts?&quot;

&quot;1, 0&quot;

&quot;Jerry, you gotta be kidding!&quot; Clover yelled.

&quot;Blast-off.&quot;

&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhh!&quot; All three screamed and were pushed into the floor, as the 
rocket launched into the atmosphere.
