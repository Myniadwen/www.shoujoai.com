<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jwmorris.html">Jago</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was a busy day over at Middleton high and when school had just 
ended, 16 year old Mona (along with her friends Charley and Lily) were 
just leaving school at the end of another week, Lily had asked Mona a 
few days earlier if she could have a sleepover at her place and after 
asking her mum and getting a nod of conficence, Mona said she could, 
Charley on the other hand wanted to join them but remembered that he 
had to help his Aunt and Uncle out on the farm which they owned. (Back 
at Middleton), Lily had grown a bit since her days as &quot;Princess Giant&quot; 
but still kept the blonde wig and crown as a souvenir and wore her 
hair fown to her waist in one ponytail and as for Mona she still had 
her dreadlocked wig but lost the cape when hit 14, and as for being 
ordinary Mona, she grew har hair down to her shoulders in one nice 
fashion.
 
Lily had become friends with Mona from the start wgen they were 
introduced to each other by their mothers on efateful day and since 
then they had been hanging out with each other pretty much as friends.
 
One day while getting her things from her locker Mona could hear 
someone coming up to her from the other end of the hallway, &quot;Hi Mona&quot; 
came a voice, she looked round and there standing there was Lily, &quot;I 
wonder where Charley is today?&quot; said Mona, Lily replyed that &quot;Charley 
could&#39;nt make it as he had to do his chors.&quot;

&quot;Here, let me help you with those things&quot;, said Lily, &quot;Thanks!&quot; Mona 
replyed Mona was wondering why Lily was being this helpful and just 
put it down to being good friends .
 
On the way out of school Lily said that she had to pick up a couple of 
things from her place and Mona said &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll give you a hand&quot;

Lily and Mona began talking about the day that they had including the 
fact that their teacher Moss Gotow was giving out information on the 
folowing day about disecting frogs, then all of a sudden Mona 
rememdered why she could have Lily round at her place, the reason was 
because Mona&#39;s folks had to go out and visist some relatives and they 
needed someone to look after the house so Mona agreed to do that and 
it was only a coincidence that Lily had asked for a sleepover at her 
place.
 
It wa sgetting on half past four when they reached Lily place, Lily 
had got the front door key of her place and both headed indoors, they 
were greeted by Mrs Duncan and were offered some cookies, Lily&#39;s 
mother had asked them how did school go and both replied that iyt was 
interesting. Mona said she was over at the Duncans household so she 
could give Lily a hand with a few items, Mr Duncan said that she 
did&#39;nt miond Lily having her friend over at the place and was glad 
that Mona and Lily had made good company with each other.
 
From upstairs, Lily called to Mona &quot;Would you mind giving me a hand 
with this please, Mona?&quot; Mona said that she would be there, which she 
did.
 
While packing and geting ready fot the sleepover. mona said that 
Lily&#39;s mother was &quot;friendly and polite&quot; and Lily said &quot;Do you think 
so?&quot; (wuth a smile) and Mona came back with the words &quot;Sure&quot; and 
carried on helping Lily with her night clothes.
 
On the way back downstairs, Mrs Duncan asked both her daughter Lily 
and her friend Mona if they had everything, and both replied that they 
had, before Lily and Mona were out the front door, Lily&#39;s mother said 
to her daughter &quot;Good Luck&quot; and wished her a good sleepover.
 
When out thr door lily said to her mother &quot;Bie, see you soon&quot; while 
Mona said to Mrs Duincan that she would &quot;Retirn her back home safely&quot; 
after the sleepover.
 
It was 4:35pm when they reached the bottom of the Duncans garden, Lily 
and Mona both walked through the garden gate and Lily closed the gate 
behind them then started to make their way through the street towards 
Mona&#39;s place.
 
On the way over they both passed officer hallcraft who was in turn 
making his way over to the police station, to start his shift. Mona 
and Lily both said &quot;Good Evening&quot; to him when they were passing then 
officer hallcraft replied &quot;gooing anywere special tonight then 
ladies?&quot; to which Mona said &quot;Just over to a sleepover at my place and 
its just me and Lily that is going tonight&quot; then officer hallcraft 
said &quot;Oh I see&quot; then left saying that he had to get to the staion for 
some urgent business.
 
While returning to the path they were making they could here the local 
church bells ringing then Mona said that &quot;they are probably ringing 
out the bells for church service&quot; then Lily stopped to look at the 
scenery and said that in a way it &quot;looked romantic the way the sun was 
setting behind the backdrop&quot; Mona stopped to admire the view Lily was 
looking and agreed with her.
 
Mona was telling Lily that one afternoon she too had stopped to gaze 
at the setting sun during onew summer day and found it peaceful and 
quite with only the birds chirping away in the trees. Once admiring 
the scenery they both looking at, both Mona and Lily carried on 
walking over wherer Mona lived .
 
On getting closer to where she lived, both Mona and Lily had noticed 
Mona&#39;s cat fang coming towards them, Lily bent down to strock him and 
fang quite literally jumped up into Lily arms and settled down so that 
Lily could carry him. &quot;Fang seems to like you, does&#39;nt he Lily&quot; said 
Mona, Lily replied that she had &quot;a thing about cats&quot; and that she 
would&#39;nt mind buying one herself at one point in time.
 
Mrs Gottow passed them on the way over to church on her bycyle and 
said &quot;High you two&quot; to which Mona and Lily said &quot;Hi there!&quot; and their 
teacher Mrs Gottow back with the question &quot;doing anything interesting 
this evening?&quot; and Lily replied she and Mona are &quot;heading over to her 
place for a sleepover&quot; to which their teacher replied, &quot;have a nice 
evening&quot;, before heading to church.
 
15 minutes later the local vicar Rev. Lovejoy bumped into them and 
asked them that &quot;Have you seen Mrs Gottow anywhere?&quot; to which Mona 
replied that she had seen their teacher heading overto the church. 
&quot;Thank you so much you two&quot; Rev. Lovejoy added before taking his 
bycycle after the teacher.,
 
When resuming the walk back to Mona&#39;s house, Mona noticed that her 
friend Lily seemed a bit nervous and asked &quot;you sem a bit nervous 
Lily, whats the matter?&quot; &quot;Oh, nothing Mona, there&#39;s just one thing I 
need to tell you&quot; Lily said, &quot;Sure&quot; said Mona &quot;But I can&#39;t tell you as 
there are to many ears listening&quot; said Lily. &quot;We can go over to my 
place, thats where we&#39;re heading, you can tell me there&quot; said Mona.
 
Once at the Parker household, Mona got outher front door key and let 
herself, Lily and their cat Fang in. &quot;I like the way youir mother has 
done the Kitchen since I was here last&quot; said Lily. Mona said &quot;Thanks 
for the compliment&quot; and proceded to give fang a saucer of milk.

Lily and Mona had already taken their shoes off so that Mona could 
wipe their shoes. Just them Lily found a note and handed it to Mona, 
saying that &quot;Its addresed to you&quot; so Mona took the note and read it. 
 
The note said &quot;Dear Mona, gone to visit relatives, food is in 
cubboards and knives and folks anr in draw and plate are next to them 
in bottom cubboard&quot; Mona read on! &quot;Everything is at your disposal, 
don&#39;t wait up as we might be back late, yours, Mrs Parker (Your 
Mother). Once things were put down on the floor in passagway and coats 
were hung up on hooks, Mona said &quot;I&#39;ll make us some food&quot; &quot;Good idea, 
I&#39;m starving anyway&quot; said a hungry Lily.
 
Once at the table Mona handed herself and Lily their food, &quot;I wonder 
where fang is&quot; said Lily,  &quot;Oh, he&#39;s back there enjoying his food&quot; 
said Mona. After finishing her meal, Lily said &quot;thanks, I enjoyed it&quot; 
and looked at Mona who was mopping her plate with a slice of bread. 
Mona turned to see Lily looking at her then smiled back at her once 
her food had been cleared. Lily the replied &quot;Here, let me help you 
with those dishes&quot; to which Mona said &quot;thanks, why don&#39;t we help each 
other with them&quot; to which Lily replied, &quot;that&#39;s a great idea&quot;.
 
The sun had already set at Middleton when the girls reached upstairs, 
Mona headed into the bathroom to do her teath while Lily had changed 
into her night clothes. Once Mona had finished in the bathroom, she 
headed inot the bedroom, lily wanted to tell Mona something but wanted 
to clean her teeth first so she got her stuff and headed to the 
bathroom to clean her teeth while Mona chainged into her nightclothes.
 
Once done Lily returned ot the bedroom then asked &quot;Mona do you mind if 
I join you in your room, there is something that I have to tell you&quot;. 
&quot;Sure, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; replied Mona.
 
Lilywent on: &quot;You see Mona, since our mothers introduced me to you and 
vice verser, we have always been good friends to each other and also I 
have been a good friend&quot;, &quot;but what you don&#39;t know is is this, since 
becoming &quot;good friends&quot; I have have started to have a crush on you 
Mona!&quot; Mona looked on with eyes wide open and with baited breath as 
Lily let loose her feelings. &quot;Mona I have always liked you as a friend 
but now it has become more than that&quot;. By that time Lily was sitting 
on Mona&#39;s bed and getting closer to her, &quot;also Mona there is this&quot; 
with that she leaned in and kissed Mona full on the lips.
 
She soon broke the kiss. When realised what had happened, Mona said 
&quot;Your in love with me !?!?!?&quot; Lily simply said: &quot;Yes Mona, I am&quot;
 
Mona and Lily loked into each other&#39;s eyes and locked lips again, this 
time throwing their arms around each other, they soon broke the kiss 
(again). Mona then said (taking Lily&#39;s clothes by her hand) &quot;Here, let 
me help you with those&quot;, Lily replied &quot;likewise&quot;, soon they stripped 
each other naked and their clothes were on the floor then Mona got 
onto her bed, face up, while Lily crawled on top of her and kissed her 
on the lips while their tongues danced in their mouths. 

Lily moved down to Mona&#39;s left breast and started to suck on it while 
her right hand cupped and gently moulded Mona&#39;s left breast. Soon Mona 
started to moan &quot;Oh Lily!&quot; Lily could her Mona&#39;s gentle moans while 
she sucked her breast, it soon popped out of Lily&#39;s mouth, quite stiff 
with the nipple quite erect.
 
Lily then moved overto Mona&#39;s right breast, licking and sucking at the 
nipple at the same time Lily wetted her fingers on herright hnad thne 
moved down to Mona&#39;s vagina and started to gently masturbate Mona. 
Mona in the mean time had her back arched with all the constant 
wanking she was receaving from Lily and also moved her left hand so 
that it was between Lily&#39; legs. Once in she started to slowly 
masturbate Lily and Lily herself had to arch her back in orgasm from 
what she was receaving from Mona.
 
Lily then climmed of Mona&#39;s left hand then moved her right hand away 
from Mona&#39;s vagina then placed her head where her right hand was and 
began slurping away at Mona&#39;s love box. Mona on the other hand had 
Lily&#39;s head locked firmly on herc pussy with her right hand while her 
left hand was tweaking her nipples while Mona was thrashing away at 
what Lily was doing to her.

Lily was just only tongueing ber but also fingering both ther twat and 
her rear entrance until Mona let out one almighty scream, Once done, 
lily brought her head up to her left hand and let Mona taste her own 
juices, Lily then proceeded to kiss her deep &quot;How does that tast Mona&quot; 
Lily added &quot;Nice!&quot; replied Mona.
 
Mona then said &quot;I know a good way of returning the favour&quot; with that 
she pulled out a double ended dildo which she kept out of the way of 
her folks, Lily was lying face cup on the bed, she liked the look of 
the thing thne Mona headed back to Lily, climebed back to Lily climbed 
back on top, kissed Lily fully on the lips before making her way down 
to her vagina before starting to tongue her. Lily began to moan gently 
the Mona placed her left hand on Lily&#39;s right breast and started to 
kneed it, while tongueing her, Mona placed one end of the dildo onto 
Lily&#39;s snatch, by that point Lily had already began to arch her back 
in pleasure.
 
Once one end was in Lily&#39;s hole Mona gently climmbed onto the other 
endthen shove her end into her vagina. Mona then came down then 
started to pump away slowly but surley fucking herself as well as 
Lily. Mona held onto the dildo with er right hand and cup Lily&#39;s 
breast with her left hand while at the same time coming down on her 
and giving Lily a full on deep throat tongue. The two of them were 
going at it especially Mona who was like a woman possessed &quot;OH MONA!&quot; 
Lily cried out,  &quot;LILY!&quot; Mona cried out then at the last moment the 
two of them cried out in unison after one long session.
 
After that the two of them curled up to each other, Lily kissed Mona 
saying &quot;I love you with all my heart Mona&quot; Mona replied, &quot;I love you 
too Lily&quot;, with that the two lovers curled up and went to sleep.
