<h1>Star-Crossed Betrayal (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/starcross-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;Word says you&#39;ve stopped hunting Starfire.  Care to explain why you 
went back on our deal?&quot;  Kali glared angrily at Blackfire before taking 
another long drink from the liquor bottle in her hand.  Blackfire 
snarled and fired a shot from her eyes.  The liquor bottle shattered in 
the demon&#39;s hands, sending pieces of glass into the air.  Before the 
shards could hit the ground, Kali slammed Blackfire into the wall.

&quot;I never needed your damn deal,&quot; Kali snarled.  &quot;Being an assassin and a 
thief means I can cut the deal whenever I want.  Raven&#39;s blood is mine 
now.  You can kill your sister if you&#39;re not frightened of her.&quot;  
Blackfire choked, pulling at Kali&#39;s hand.  The demon only tightened her 
hand around Blackfire&#39;s neck.

&quot;It was Slade&#39;s money,&quot; the alien gasped.  &quot;He&#39;s not going to be happy 
that you&#39;re backing out.&quot;

&quot;Do you think I care?&quot; Kali demanded.  &quot;Slade can kill himself for all I 
care!  My battle with Raven is in six days.  If you want Starfire dead, 
kill her then.  Now get out!&quot;  She threw Blackfire out of an already 
broken window and slumped against a wall.  A few moments later, Kali 
grabbed another full liquor bottle and stared at the shimmering liquid.

Her thumb and forefinger grasped the cap of the bottle and almost began 
to twist it off.  However, Kali found herself unable to move the cap one 
centimeter.  She sighed in weariness for the first time in three hundred 
years.  It had been three hundred years since she had slept or stopped 
consuming liquor by the gallon.  With an angry, feral snarl, she hurled 
the bottle away.

The glass crashed into a bare light bulb and shattered it.  The bottle, 
merely singed by a few errant sparks, spiraled through the air and 
smashed into tiny fragments on the floor across the room.  Kali looked 
out the broken window and felt her eyes burn with her first tears of 
despair.  Black clouds covered the moon and cast the entirety of the 
city into darkness.  Out of anger, misery, and sheer exhaustion, Kali 
fell to the floor and sobbed.  She weakly pounded her fist against the 
floor, tears falling into the dust covering the ground.

Before long, the demon had fallen into an incredibly deep sleep.  Kali 
had curled into a ball, her arms wrapped around herself as if 
substituting for something.  Her form, frail in her slumber, shook with 
the emotions that had ravaged her being for the past few centuries.  
Only in her tormented, fragmented dreams could she let herself feel 
those emotions.  If she let anything get to her, she would be unable to 
move from the pain in her terrible soul.  Kali slept for the first time 
in a very long time, weeping as her dreams confused and destroyed her 
even more.

----------

Starfire&#39;s eyelids twitched and slowly opened.  She stared up at the 
ceiling for a time, her vision eventually clearing.  Though she felt 
drained, Starfire realized that she was remarkably uninjured.  She had 
no idea if she had dreamt in her unconsciousness, and was suddenly 
terrified that Raven might have been hurt guarding her.

The girl sat up as quickly as she could and rushed to the main chamber 
of the tower.  Cyborg and Beast Boy were, as always, battling for 
electronic supremacy in one of their many racing games.  Robin was 
sitting on the back of the couch, laughing every so often as Cyborg or 
Beast Boy threw jibs at each other.  The sound of the door hissing shut 
drew Robin to turn about.  When he laid eyes upon Starfire, he smiled 
and laughed with a wave.

&quot;Great to see you up again, Star,&quot; he said.  Cyborg paused the game so 
he and Beast Boy could see their teammate.  Beast Boy let out a cheer, 
leaping into the air and landing in Starfire&#39;s arms as an adorable 
kitten.  Starfire smiled at the green cat, scratching behind his ears.

&quot;I am glad to be up again,&quot; she replied.  &quot;But where is Raven?  Has 
something happened to her?&quot;  Beast Boy bounced out of Starfire&#39;s arms 
and turned back to his usual form.

&quot;No, she&#39;s fine,&quot; he said as he returned to the couch.  &quot;She&#39;s just been 
up on the roof for the last nine days.&quot;

&quot;Nine days?&quot; Starfire asked.  &quot;Have I been sleeping for so long?  But 
why is she there and not here with us?&quot;

&quot;She said she needs to think about something,&quot; Robin explained, walking 
to his friend and teammate.  &quot;She said that Kali&#39;s target has changed.  
Kali&#39;s after Raven now.&quot;  Starfire paled at Robin&#39;s words and turned 
about to hurry and find Raven.  Robin watched her go without any malice 
in his heart.

----------

Raven heard the door open and close.  She heard hurried footsteps and 
their sudden stop behind her.  She felt a rush of air as the person fell 
to their knees behind her.  She felt familiar arms wrap around her but 
didn&#39;t move.  Starfire was trembling with silent tears, the small drops 
falling onto Raven&#39;s neck.

&quot;Why are you crying?&quot; Raven questioned gently, lifting her hands to 
gently hold Starfire&#39;s.

&quot;Why must you be the demon&#39;s target?&quot; Starfire whispered, her voice 
strained in distress.  &quot;I do not want you injured as I have been!  
Please!&quot;

&quot;Starfire, I can&#39;t change Kali&#39;s mind,&quot; Raven murmured, turning about 
and pulling Starfire into a hug.  &quot;I don&#39;t know why she wants to kill 
me, but I won&#39;t leave you.  Don&#39;t worry about tomorrow.&quot;  Starfire froze 
at her words.

&quot;What happens tomorrow?&quot; she asked.  The way Raven did not meet her eyes 
told Starfire everything.  Starfire&#39;s tears started anew and she clung 
to Raven, trembling with her sobs.  Raven stroked Starfire&#39;s hair, 
laying soft kisses on Starfire&#39;s forehead.

----------

Blackfire snarled as she landed at the top of the mountain.  Kali was 
sitting on a large stone, her eyes locked on Titan&#39;s Tower.  The silence 
between them was filled with tangible hatred.

&quot;Raven and Starfire are almost here,&quot; Kali suddenly spoke up.  &quot;If you 
value your life at all, stay out of my battle with Raven.&quot;  Blackfire 
let out a small scoff, crossing her arms and turning her attention to 
the darkening sky.  A soft wind blew by as Starfire and Raven landed 
before Kali and Blackfire.  The silence of dusk seemed at odds with the 
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e that was about to begin.

The sun finally sank below the verge of the sky and cast the world into 
the pale moonlight.  Kali lifted her sword and set it against the moon.  
She stared at the glistening blade, the light reflecting into her 
blood-toned eyes.  Raven saw the sudden change in the light, how Kali&#39;s 
hand tensed.  Not one second later, Raven had been forced backwards off 
the summit the group stood upon.  Kali had leapt full-force at Raven, 
and the two were locked in a battle in a world only they could exist in.

&quot;Raven!&quot; Starfire cried out in worry.  She began to move towards the 
precipice but was abruptly cut off by her sister.  Blackfire hurled a 
blast of energy into Starfire&#39;s torso, sending the girl flying 
backwards.

&quot;No you don&#39;t!&quot; Blackfire shouted.  &quot;You&#39;re fighting me, little sister, 
and no one is going to help you this time!&quot;  Starfire pulled herself out 
of the rocks she had landed in, her eyes lighting with her anger.

&quot;I do not need help fighting you!&quot; she snarled.  Energy flashed from her 
eyes and caught Blackfire off-guard.  The older of the sisters was flung 
into the air and Starfire laid chase.

Raven barely dodged another slash, a thin line of red briefly appearing 
on her cheek before healing.  She found herself moving with the same 
speed that she had dueled Chaos with, even though her emotions were 
astonishingly calm.  She realized now how much power she had and why the 
archangel Gabriel had personally placed a limiter release to let her 
powers surge as she needed them.

As she dodged and blocked each strike, Raven became aware of how futile 
the battle was.  Kali was fighting with everything she had; every 
emotion and muscle was tuned to her effort to kill Raven.  Raven, 
however, was barely using any of her magic or her strength.  Both of 
them knew that Raven&#39;s skills were beyond anything Kali could ever 
attain, and still the pureblood demon kept fighting.

Kali coughed hard as Raven landed a heavy blow on her ribs.  Her clawed 
hand covered the area as her legs shook from the pain.  Though her 
breathing was ragged and hindered by sudden coughs of blood, Kali 
doubled her already labored exertion and rushed at Raven once more with 
a cry for blood.

Above them, Starfire had gained the upper hand on her sister.  Blackfire 
was on the defensive, scarcely dodging the bursts of crushing energy 
that Starfire let loose.  Truthfully, Blackfire was beginning to see 
that her battle was hopeless as well.  Starfire had become the better 
warrior.  With one more massive shot, Starfire sent Blackfire back 
through the air and into the mountaintop.

Breathing heavily, Starfire flew down to kneel by her unmoving sister.  
She saw that Blackfire was still breathing and not terribly injured, and 
thus felt no guilt about defeating her sister so.  She turned about to 
find if Raven was unharmed and gasped.  Raven and Kali stood in 
identical stances, with their swords pulled back for a killing strike.  
Before Starfire could react, the two rushed at each other.

A crash sounded as blade struck blade.  Starfire tentatively opened her 
eyes and found Raven standing straight, her sword fading from sight and 
a faint smile on her face.  She gasped, terrified that Raven had been 
injured and that Kali had vanished after her killing blow.

&quot;You have a very strange sense of timing, Chaos,&quot; Raven chuckled, 
turning about and smiling.  Starfire cast her eyes about and found Chaos 
standing a few yards away from Raven.  Kali was unconscious in the demon 
woman&#39;s arms.  Rather overjoyed that Raven was unharmed, Starfire leapt 
from the cliff and flew to the sorceress.

Chaos looked back to the cliff, her ears catching a sound that Starfire 
and Raven were unaware of.  Blackfire had revived and crawled to the 
edge of the cliff.  She summoned the last shreds of her energy to fire a 
deadly shot at both Raven and Starfire.  Chaos grinned her terrible 
fanged grin and cast her own spell of death.

Starfire turned when she heard her sister&#39;s scream.  Black flames 
ironically consumed Blackfire and turned her into ash.  The young alien 
froze as the flames faded into the clear, crisp night, staring at where 
her sister had been.  She turned rather haltingly towards Chaos, who 
returned her gaze with a smirk.

&quot;My debt is done,&quot; Chaos hummed.  &quot;Thanks, Raven, for not beating Kali 
up too badly.  Goodbye, you two lovely heroes.&quot;  She turned and began to 
walk away.  Kali stirred in her arms and looked up at her sleepily.  A 
faint smile graced the demon woman&#39;s face as she snuggled against Chaos.

&quot;My tainted knight in black armor,&quot; Kali sighed happily.  Chaos chuckled 
at the pet name.  She summoned her black-feathered wings and rose up 
into the air.  They vanished from the moon&#39;s eye.
