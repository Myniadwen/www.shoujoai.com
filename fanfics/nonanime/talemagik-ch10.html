<h1>Kitty and Illyana: A Tale of Magik! (part 10 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>        Illyanna lay there unconscious not far from where Kitty stood, 
the bruise on her temple already darkening to a dark blue. Kitty 
raised the Soulsword, silvery fire dancing all along the blade as the 
mystic armor gradually materialized on her arm. All around them 
figures looked on in awe and just a little fear as the confrontation 
continued.

        &quot;You had no right,&quot; Kitty finally growled out softly.

        The figure floated in front of her, garbed in a blue bodysuit 
with gold gloves and boots. A golden helm concealed the entire head, a 
matching amulet clasping a long cape at his throat. &quot;One so 
contaminated by dark magic,&quot; the voice was eerily hollow sounding, 
&quot;must not be allowed to become this dimension&#39;s sorcerer supreme.&quot;

        Kitty raised the sword slightly, her expression clearly 
furious. &quot;This isn&#39;t your dimension, Dr. Fate,&quot; she said to him 
coldly, &quot;or should I say Nabu the Wise, the renegade Lord of Order?&quot;

        Dr. Fate jerked back slightly, obviously surprised that she 
knew that much about him. &quot;You are not quite what I was expecting,&quot; he 
acknowledged softly.

        &quot;And I&#39;m very well aware how far you are from the sources of 
your power,&quot; Kitty continued on grimly. She leveled the sword at his 
head, &quot;I probably couldn&#39;t take you on, normally. But this weapon 
channels raw magic, Nabu.&quot; A cold little smile appeared on her face, 
&quot;Get out of here before I peel that helmet right off your head.&quot;

        A long moment of quiet as eyes met eyes in the dim room, the 
feeling like lightning crackling between them. Finally, Fate nodded to 
her slightly, &quot;This isn&#39;t over between us.&quot; With that, in a flash of 
golden light he was gone.

        Kitty opened up her hand, letting the Soulsword disappear as 
she stumbled past the dining tables of the Witching Hour to where 
Illyanna lay. One of the waitresses bent down to help them and Kitty 
fixed her with a glare, &quot;I thought this place was neutral territory!&quot;

        &quot;It should be,&quot; the catgirl helped gently pick Illyanna up, 
the two carefully carrying her over to a padded bench. She gave Kitty 
a rueful smile before admitting, &quot;But beings as powerful as Dr. Fate 
tend to make their own rules.&quot;

        Kitty nodded slightly, acknowledging the point, She brushed 
Illyanna&#39;s hair back, wincing at the mark there. &quot;Could you get me a 
icepack, please, Miss...?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m Luna,&quot; the dark haired catgirl smiled slightly as she 
smoothly rose to her feet, &quot;I&#39;ll be right back with some ice.&quot;

        Kitty softly spoke the words of healing, magic dancing around 
the bruise as she cradled her lover close to her. The two of them had 
come here to have a simple romantic dinner together, then that gold 
garbed creep had shown up to ruin it. He had claimed that Illyanna 
would betray both Kitty and Dr. Strange, and when she refused to 
believe him he had attacked them viciously.

        &quot;Here you go,&quot; Luna bent over, offering the icepack.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Kitty held the ice gently to the side of Illyanna&#39;s 
head. All around them the patrons and staff chipped in to restore the 
nightclub back to it&#39;s former state. Tables were righted, debris swept 
up, and in one case a small fire extinguished.

        Illyanna groaned softly, her eye&#39;s cracking open slightly as 
she mumbled, &quot;What hit me?&quot; A moment, then her eyes popped open as she 
sat up and growled angrily, &quot;Where is he!?&quot;

        &quot;He bolted,&quot; Kitty gently pushed on Illyanna&#39;s shoulder to 
make her lay down, &quot;Take it easy, you&#39;ve been hurt.&quot;

        &quot;Oww,&quot; Illyanna flinched slightly, the blonde reaching up to 
press the icepack a bit more firmly to the side of her head. &quot;I 
thought the Lords of Order were supposed to be the good guys, fighting 
to save the universe from the evil Lords of Chaos,&quot; she softly 
complained, &quot;so why did he decide to go after me?&quot;

        Kitty smiled wryly, &quot;Nabu was also notorious for meddling in 
human affairs. Guess he figured we weren&#39;t the ones to be doing this 
job.&quot;

        &quot;Dr. Strange was the one to be making that call,&quot; Illyanna 
said dryly, &quot;certainly not him.&quot; A bit reluctantly she sat up on her 
own, wincing a bit but looking a little better. She set the icepack 
aside, her bruise gradually clearing up from Kitty&#39;s healing spell.

        Luna walked over carrying two plates, which she set down in 
front of them. &quot;Your dinners, on the house,&quot; she said, softly adding, 
&quot;I&#39;m going to petition that Fate be banned. I don&#39;t know if it will 
work, but it&#39;s worth a try.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Kitty smiled.

        &quot;Your girlfriend was so fierce in defending you,&quot; Luna beamed 
over at Illyanna, &quot;you should be very proud of her.&quot;

        Once Luna left them alone Illyanna gave Kitty a look, &quot;Why do 
I get the feeling that Fate didn&#39;t bolt all on his own?&quot;

        Kitty blushed a bit, &quot;I kind of bluffed him using the 
Soulsword.&quot;

        There was a sudden snort of laughter from a table nearby. A 
smiling John Constantine pushed his messy brown hair out of his eyes, 
&quot;Hell of a bluff! She actually threatened to peel the helmet off of 
Fate&#39;s head.&quot; He rose, tossing a few pound notes down on the table, 
&quot;If you ever want a job, Pryde, let me know. I was impressed.&quot; With 
that he pulled his trenchcoat on and left, maneuvering through the 
crowd to the exit.

        &quot;Bluffed, huh?&quot; Illyanna smiled at her fondly as Kitty 
blushed. &quot;Remind me not to piss you off,&quot; she added softly as she 
gently pressed her lips to hers.

        &quot;I doubt you ever would,&quot; Kitty managed a bit breathlessly 
once they separated.

        Illyanna chuckled softly, &quot;Hope not.&quot; With that both young 
women dug into their food, savoring the finely prepared foods and 
drinking moderately. Their eyes would meet as they looked up from 
their meals, lingering a moment before returning to their dishes.

        &quot;Ah, that was good,&quot; Kitty finally set her fork down, leaning 
back with a sigh.

        Illyanna had to smile, &quot;You&#39;re appetite never ceases to amaze 
me.&quot; She shook her head, looking Kitty over, &quot;Where does it all go?&quot;

        An impish little smile appeared on Kitty&#39;s face, &quot;I thought 
you liked it when I was... hungry.&quot;

        Illyanna blushed, &quot;Pryde, you&#39;ve got a dirty mind.&quot; They 
shared softly laughter, and Illyanna reached over to lay her hand over 
Kitty&#39;s, &quot;Do you ever worry about what Fate said?&quot; More softly, 
&quot;Belasco got his hooks into me pretty deep.&quot;

        &quot;No, I don&#39;t,&quot; Kitty leaned over to kiss Illyanna gently.

        &quot;Is that the lover talking,&quot; Illyanna murmured once they 
separated, &quot;or the sorceress?&quot;

        &quot;Both,&quot; Kitty answered softly. She smiled at Illyanna gently, 
&quot;When Belasco abducted you to Limbo he did his best to corrupt you, to 
reshape you into a mirror of him. Despite being a little girl you 
fought him every step of the way, and in the end you beat him.&quot;

        &quot;And lost some good friends doing so,&quot; Illyanna murmured, 
remembering the alternate versions of Ororo, Kurt, and Cat that had 
been slain in that other world.

        &quot;They&#39;d want you to be happy, Illyanna,&quot; Kitty squeezed her 
hand gently, &quot;And you are happy, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

        A few tears glistened in Illyanna&#39;s eyes, &quot;Happier than I&#39;ve 
ever been.&quot; A deep breath, &quot;I guess that&#39;s why the idea of loosing it 
all scares me so bad.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere,&quot; Kitty said firmly. Softly she 
continued, &quot;And I&#39;ll keep on telling you that until you believe it.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Illyanna wiped away a tear.

Author&#39;s Notes: This is the original Dr. Fate, not the version that&#39;s 
currently appearing in various DC comics. While having the best of 
intentions Fate could be both arrogant and foolish, much like he is 
depicted here. I don&#39;t think he actually ever meddled inside of the 
Marvel comics universe, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me much if he did..

Illyanna&#39;s battles with Belasco were shown in the four issue 
mini-series Magik, published by Marvel Comics in the early 1980&#39;s. The 
alternate Ororo became a sorceress to battle Belasco, Shadowcat became 
a cat-girl, and Kurt was transformed into a demon. Ororo died in 
battle with Belasco, and Illyanna was forced to kill both the 
transformed Kurt and Kitty in battle.
