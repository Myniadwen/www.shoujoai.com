They spotted the first ships on the Watchtower sensors
at the edge of the solar system, quickly identifying
and sorting the various vessels. There were an
astonishing mix of craft, from a dozen worlds
including Dominators, Khunds, Thangar, Tamaranean and
many more, all battered and showing signs of battle.

&quot;Space task force,&quot; Kyla Scott said, the Green Lantern
of Earth leading a mix of space based heroes away from
Earth&#39;s orbit to meet the incoming fleet, &quot;let&#39;s see
what&#39;s going on.&quot;

J&#39;onn Jonnz&#39; voice echoed in their minds as the green
skinned Martian Manhunter said, &quot;I&#39;m only picking up
fear and terror in the incoming ships, not
aggression.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s comforting,&quot; Captain Atom said, his silvery
skin gleaming.

&quot;I&#39;m getting distress transmissions on multiple
frequencies,&quot; Steel reported, B-ko&#39;s heavy space armor
gleaming, &quot;many of the ships are on their last legs.&quot;

&quot;All right, we&#39;ll intercept the ships and guide them
into orbits around the moon,&quot; Supergirl took charge,
her only concession for the rigors of space a simple
breathing mask. She smiled at the questioning looks,
&quot;We don&#39;t want a panic on Earth, which is what would
happen if all these ships took up orbits there.&quot;

Using the Green Lantern power ring, telepathy and
standard communications the team quickly began guiding
ships into taking up positions in Lunar orbit, even as
heroes provided emergency aide. Power ring bubbles
maintained atmosphere in badly damaged ships,
emergency welds and other repairs keeping them safe
for now.

Of course, something had to go wrong.

&quot;Too badly damaged...&quot; they heard over a sputtering
communications system as the Thangaran warship
barreled by the startled heroes, it&#39;s engines flaring
wildly as it vented atmosphere, unable to change it&#39;s
course. Swiftly the heroes tried to intercept it,
power ring constructs and physical power slowing it&#39;s
wild pace but they were unable to stop it.

Oracle spoke calmly from her station within the
Watchtower base, reporting, &quot;I&#39;m plotting it&#39;s course,
it&#39;s going to splash down in the Atlantic ocean.&quot; A
short pause, &quot;I&#39;m dispatching Aqualad, Mecha and
Mermaid to assist.&quot;

Beneath the sea Orin smiled slightly, the red headed
Atlantean swimming easily to where the ship had
impacted to the ocean floor. &#39;My first mission with
the JLA,&#39; he mused, &#39;I wonder if I&#39;ll always get the
sea jobs?&#39;

&quot;We&#39;ll reach the ship in moments,&quot; Mecha reported, the
golden skinned robot jetting through the water via
engines mounted on her back and feet.

&quot;I&#39;m surprised I was called in,&quot; Mermaid said mildly,
the half Atlantean woman moving through the water like
a shark with her fish&#39;s tail, &quot;considering I&#39;m a
member of the Ultramarines.&quot; The blonde haired woman
had been taken captive by the notorious mad scientist
Dr. Sivana years ago, his experiments leaving her with
enhanced powers but also her more fishlike traits.

Orin smiled back wryly, &quot;I think that Supergirl
doesn&#39;t really care about what team you&#39;re on, if she
needs your help, she asks.&quot;

Mermaid chuckled as they plunged deeper into the
depths, tail fluttering gracefully as she murmured, &quot;I
noticed.&quot;

The ship lay on a broken section of reef, air bubbling
out of it ominously as it took on water. The Thangaran
warship looked much like a bird of prey, even with all
of the damage, a wounded hawk waiting for care.

&quot;I&#39;m picking up lifesigns,&quot; Mecha reported as she
scanned the wreck, &quot;but they&#39;re very weak.&quot; A pause,
&quot;I can probably project a forcefield around it, keep
more water from getting in, then we can try to pull
the passengers out.&quot;

&quot;There might be another way,&quot; Orin offered, &quot;let me
try.&quot;

The red haired young man concentrated, liquid swirling
around his hands, then the water literally pulled back
from the vessel, forming a bubble around it. Water
concentrated below the battered ship, quickly
solidifying into a hard shelf beneath it, then slowly
began to lift the vessel up towards the surface.

&quot;You can create solid water?&quot; Mermaid said in awe as
they followed the ship up to the surface, &quot;That&#39;s
incredible.&quot;

&quot;A gift I inherited from my mother,&quot; Orin said
distractedly, most of his attention focused on the
ship and raising it safely.

They broke the surface, the ship resting on the top of
the sea as in a flash of light Green Lantern arrived.
&quot;We haven&#39;t had a chance to check on the pilot,&quot; Mecha
called as she used her thrusters to launch herself out
of the water, quickly converting to flight mode.

Kyla slapped a green platform underneath it to take
the weight off the visibly tiring Orin, then they
gathered at the main hatch. &quot;No response,&quot; she
murmured as she tapped the open switch, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll
have to use the ring...&quot;

CLACK!

The hatch shuddered then jerked up as the passenger
opened it, smoke billowing out from within the vessel.
The pilot staggered out, coughing as her red hair
spilled from the back of the hawklike helm she wore,
her Thangaran military uniform battered and burned.

Pulling off her helm the beautiful young woman smiled
grimly, her brown eyes narrowing. &quot;My name is Katar
Thal,&quot; she introduced herself tiredly, &quot;and I hope
you&#39;re the Justice League, or we&#39;re all in trouble.&quot;
And with that she flopped over in a dead faint, D-ko
barely moving fast enough to catch her.

&quot;We&#39;d better get her up to the Watchtower,&quot; Orin
blinked, &quot;does anyone know who she is?&quot;

&quot;I do, maybe,&quot; Kyla blinked.

&quot;I&#39;d love to stick around,&quot; Mermaid said with a half
smile, &quot;but I think my fellow Ultramarines could use
an update.&quot; She smiled right at Orin, &quot;If you need any
more help, just ask handsome.&quot; With that she was gone,
sliding away beneath the sea with a splash of her
tail.

&quot;I think she likes you,&quot; Mecha said impishly as the
teleporter activated, in an instant sending them to a
large chamber in the Watchtower&#39;s hangar bays.

&quot;Just leave it alone,&quot; Orin muttered, blushing.

Not long after, members of the Justice League gathered
to confirm notes. Kestrel and Oracle had organized the
eight vessels in parking orbits around the moon,
providing supplies and resources for the damages
ships,. All had similar stories, the crews refugees
fleeing a powerful invasion force made up of different
war-like races.

&quot;Apparently,&quot; Helena Wayne said from where she sat at
the meeting table, her black hair slicked down a bit
from being under her Kestrel costume&#39;s cowl, &quot;most of
these ships are from races that actually signed on
with the invasion. They disagreed and were either
imprisoned or attacked, hence their decision to bolt.&quot;

&quot;The ships are spaceworthy,&quot; B-ko reported tiredly,
her blue hair flowing in a wave over her shoulders,
&quot;but they&#39;ve been through the wars. We&#39;ll need to
provide additional supplies and repairs if we want
them to stay up there for any length of time.&quot;

&quot;Do you think..?&quot; Helena looked at her curiously.

&quot;Lexcorp has already pledged to help,&quot; B-ko smiled
wryly thinking of her short conversation with her
mother, &quot;though I think she&#39;s just eager to get a look
at those ship&#39;s technology.&quot;

&quot;Good enough,&quot; A-ko nodded, red hair flowing. She
looked to Orin, D-ko and Kyla, &quot;So what about our
splashdown?&quot;

&quot;She collapsed almost as soon as we got her out of her
ship,&quot; D-ko revealed, &quot;J&#39;onn is in sickbay with her
now.&quot;

&quot;Her name is Katar Thal, a Thangarian soldier,&quot; Kyla
Scott said seriously, &quot;if I&#39;m right about the name, I
think she&#39;s related to Shayera Thal, who for a while
was called Hawkwoman.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s my mother,&quot; the tired voice said. Looking up
they saw Katar standing in the doorway, leaning on
J&#39;onn for support and wearing just a medical robe. &quot;I
hate to interrupt,&quot; she sighed, &quot;but you need to hear
this now.&quot;

A chair was brought over and the woman nearly
collapsed into her seat. &quot;You should be resting,&quot; A-ko
said, &quot;you&#39;re in no shape...&quot;

&quot;Warworld is coming,&quot; Katar cut her off, &quot;an entire
planet built for combat, armed and armored to be
nearly undefeatable.&quot; She took a breath, &quot;They have
warriors from a dozen species, as well as leaders who
seem even more powerful than anything I&#39;ve seen.&quot;

&quot;How long until they arrive?&quot; Helena demanded.

&quot;A week, maybe more,&quot; Katar answered, &quot;they seem to be
taking their time.&quot;

You could have heard a pin drop in the room. &quot;I have
some more bad news,&quot; Kyla said grimly, &quot;after we saw
the ships inbound, I contacted the Green Lantern
Corps.&quot; Feeling their eyes on her she continued,
&quot;Green Lanterns from nearby sectors have disappeared
without warning, I assume trying to fight this
Warworld.&quot;

&quot;Then I guess we&#39;ll just have to step up our
preparations,&quot; B-ko said grimly.

&quot;Flash is earthside along with Firestorm,&quot; Oracle
noted, &quot;I&#39;ll page them again.&quot;

&quot;I wonder if their date went better than expected?&quot;
Kyla murmured, getting some surprised chuckles from
the others.

&quot;Helena?&quot; Oracle asked softly, getting the attention
of the young heroine. &quot;I ran through the databases of
the ships and found something important.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Helena looked curious.

&quot;Your biological mother, Nightstar, is aboard the
Tamaran refugee ship,&quot; Oracle revealed.</pre>
