<h1>Conquest: One's Own Honor (part 8 of 12)</h1>

<a href="../nonanime/1honor-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&quot;They&#39;re going to where?&quot; Michelle blinked in
surprise, the dusky skinned officer standing on her
bridge as a section of the Fleet hung in deep space
near a solar system out on the very edge of Jurai
colonized space.

Honor Harrington adjusted her uniform a bit
uncomfortably, the brown haired woman on the
viewscreen looking good with the new insignias of an
Admiral on her collar. &quot;I&#39;m not sure the name of the
bar,&quot; she answered her mildly from her own ship, the
Nike, &quot;but Ryouko is on a planet in this system
looking for that Galaxy Police officer, Kiyone.&quot;

&quot;Must have impressed Ryouko,&quot; Michelle noted. The
battle with Kagato had ended months ago, the Manticore
fleet working quickly to rebuild it&#39;s forces. One
unexpected effect of the conflict had been the
attention it had brought from the surviving galactic
empires, more than one watching the young military
power warily.

&quot;That she did,&quot; Honor agreed. She scowled, recalling
the information they received in the aftermath. In
return for helping them defeat Kagato Kiyone had been
tried by the GP, finally choosing to plead guilty to
lesser charges in exchange for a dishonorable
discharge.

&quot;Bleek,&quot; Nimitz chided her, the slim treecat clinging
to his chosen person&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Stinker knows you pretty well,&quot; Michelle commented.
She looked curious, &quot;Why does Jurai have such a hatred
for Ryouko, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Besides the fact that Manticore is a potential threat
to Jurai,&quot; Honor smiled slightly, &quot;there&#39;s supposed to
be bad blood between Ryouko and the Emperor.
Apparently a few years back Jurai attempted to force a
colony that was looking for independence back into the
fold....&quot;

&quot;And Ryouko stopped them,&quot; Michelle anticipated.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Honor nodded, &quot;and the Emperor took it as a
personal insult.&quot; One of Honor&#39;s staff discretely
signaled her and she sighed, &quot;Excuse me, Captain.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll talk more later,&quot; Michelle flashed a smile
before disconnecting.

Honor looked towards her tactical officer, &quot;Kei,
what&#39;s the situation?&quot;

&quot;Ryo-Ohki is inbound,&quot; the redhead reported then Kei
frowned, &quot;but I&#39;m picking up two unknown drive
signatures as well. I can&#39;t be certain, but I&#39;d say
they were civilian ships trying to conceal their
presence.&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Honor frowned. The majority of Fleet
was back in Manticore space along with the Washu&#39;s
revenge, they only had about ten ships handy, mostly
light but fast battlecruisers. &quot;Put me through to
Minagi,&quot; she ordered.

&quot;Admiral,&quot; Minagi looked up with a welcoming smile,
her long blue mane flowing down over her shoulders.
The scars on each of her cheeks didn&#39;t distract from
the warmth of her smile, in a way they only added to
it.

&quot;... we don&#39;t know for sure what those ships are,&quot;
Honor finished, &quot;but there are rumors of slavery rings
out here. I&#39;d like you to take your Valiant and the
Striker to investigate, the rest of us remaining to
cover Ryouko.&quot;

&quot;Good plan,&quot; Minagi said simply, her eyes lit up with
excitement, &quot;I&#39;m on it.&quot; With that she disconnected,
external views showing the two cruisers swiftly moving
off to investigate the unknown ships, soon
accelerating to near maximum.

&quot;Ryo-Ohki has entered communications range,&quot; Webster
offered, the young man smiling slightly, &quot;we&#39;re being
hailed.&quot;

&quot;Put them on,&quot; Honor answered.

Ryouko looked much like her twin, only the unmarked
cheeks and different uniform making her different.
&quot;Open the docking bays,&quot; she grinned, &quot;mission
accomplished.&quot;

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Honor answered, noting the black
haired woman who stood beside Ryouko. She looked
visibly tired, a bit the worse for wear and Honor
added, &quot;And may I personally welcome you, Officer
Kiyone?&quot;

Kiyone looked up in surprise but managed a smile. &quot;I&#39;m
not an officer any more,&quot; she answered, &quot;but thanks
for the thought.&quot;

Ryouko cut the connection and Honor turned to leave
the bridge as she formally said, &quot;Number one, you have
the bridge.&quot; The lift swiftly carried her down then
out to the docking bays even as she considered the
woman she that had just seen. &#39;It looks like things
haven&#39;t been easy for her since she left the GP,&#39;&#39;
Honor noted, &#39;best keep that in mind.&#39;

Honor reached the docking bay in time to see Ryo-Ohki
arrive, the unique crystalline ship slipping in
through the bay doors easily. A transport beam
smoothly set Ryouko and Kiyone down onto the deck then
the ship shrank, form shifting until it return to it&#39;s
cabbit shape.

&quot;Bleek!&quot; Nimitz cheerfully hailed his furry friend
even as Honor strode inside and gave Ryouko a formal
salute.

&quot;You know that I hate that formal stuff,&quot; Ryouko
complained with a smile. She turned to Kiyone, &quot;I&#39;d
like you to meet Admiral Honor Harrington, she was the
one who was in command when you aided us against
Kagato.&quot;

&quot;That took guts,&quot; Kiyone offered her hand, &quot;and
courage. Not many leaders would have kept up the
pressure that way, knowing the risks they were
taking.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Honor managed a smile, her own feelings
mixed about that battle. It was a victory, yes, but
far too many lives had been lost for her to feel very
good about it.

&quot;Where did Minagi take off to so fast?&quot; Ryouko asked
curiously as they headed to the lifts.

&quot;We spotted two suspicious ships in the area,&quot; Honor
relayed, &quot;operating covertly, she went to check them
out.&quot; She paused, &quot;Considering the rumors of human
smuggling in the region, I thought it best we
investigated.&quot;

&quot;That could be a problem,&quot; Ryouko frowned as they
swiftly headed to the bridge, &quot;Minagi has a strong
dislike for slavers.&quot; As they arrived with barely a
thump she quietly added, &quot;I think it comes from being
a slave herself, once.&quot;

Honor kept her poise, barely, as they all moved out
onto the bridge. &quot;Transmit to all vessels in the
squadron,&quot; she ordered crisply, &quot;the Empress is
aboard, we&#39;re moving out to meet Minagi&#39;s ships.&quot;

&quot;Transmitted,&quot; Webster acknowledged.

&quot;Moving to projected course of the Valiant and
Striker,&quot; Prescott said, the older man at the helm
moving with smooth confidence.

&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Kiyone murmured, looking around the
bridge with no little awe.

Honor smiled slightly, keeping her eyes on the screen
as they moved out. The bridge was a hybrid of Washu&#39;s
design innovations and Basilisk military tech,
crystalline microcircuitry fused with cutting edge
military tech. The holo-imaging tank took up a quarter
of the bridge, tactical and helm up front, security,
communications and engineering positions in behind.
Round and spacious there were extra seats for other
officers and staff, as well as powerful defensive
screens.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Kei called her attention as the young woman
continued, &quot;I&#39;m picking up weapons discharges, at the
edge of sensor range.&quot;

&quot;Increase to maximum acceleration,&quot; Honor ordered
crisply. Dropping her voice a bit she addressed
Ryouko, &quot;Exactly how strongly does she dislike
slavers?&quot;

&quot;She wouldn&#39;t attack without provocation,&quot; Ryouko
shrugged, &quot;but her definition of provocation has
always been a bit looser than mine.&quot;

&quot;Marvelous,&quot; Honor muttered.

&quot;Should you go to battlestations?&quot; Kiyone ventured.

&quot;Not a bad idea,&quot; Honor said then gave the order. As
the signal rang through the ship she continued, &quot;As
long as the slavers don&#39;t have backup, we should have
tactical superiority.&quot; She paused, &quot;As long as they&#39;re
not using Q-ships, anyway.&quot;

&quot;Q-ships?&quot; Ryouko asked curiously.

&quot;Merchant vessels secretly refit as warships,&quot; Honor
answered, &quot;they&#39;re very dangerous as ambushers but not
so good in a stand-up fight. I understand Haven used
them during the war.&quot;

&quot;The Galaxy Police impounded a few,&quot; Kiyone agreed.

The images on the viewscreen grew as they approached,
the flashes of weapons fire trailing off as Minagi&#39;s
two cruisers rode herd over the three merchant
vessels. Unnecessarily Kei reported, &quot;Their engines
are disabled but otherwise they&#39;re undamaged.&quot;

&quot;Hail Minagi,&quot; Honor ordered.

&quot;Boss,&quot; Minagi appeared, her clothes a bit smudged but
otherwise looking unharmed, &quot;I&#39;m surprised to see you
so soon.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the situation?&quot; Ryouko asked curiously, noting
several battered looking men and women in matching
uniforms behind Minagi.

&quot;They fired on me as soon as I neared, and we returned
fire,&quot; Minagi shrugged. &quot;I took a few crew, boarded
&#39;em and confirmed they&#39;re slavers.&quot; Her eyes darkened
with anger, &quot;And they were augmenting their captives,
sis.&quot;

Honor bit back her anger, but barely. Unwilling
augmentation of any citizen was horrible, and the kind
of things these slavers might want.... &quot;What are we
dealing with?&quot; Honor asked grimly.

&quot;Pilot modifications,&quot; Minagi responded, &quot;along with a
partial or complete brain-memory wipe. Apparently
they&#39;re selling these girls to the highest bidder.&quot;

&quot;Bring the victims aboard,&quot; Ryouko said with
surprising gentleness, &quot;we&#39;ll get them to Washu and
Yume, hopefully they can help.&quot; Her voice hardened,
&quot;And your captives, they&#39;re facing trial on Manticore
for slavery and anything else we can come up with.&quot;</pre>
