<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Two weeks later, Kitty and Rogue were back sitting on the hill by the 
quarry. The mail had arrived yesterday, and they had watched several 
films Stevie had sent them together. Kitty and Rogue had each received 
letters, and both contained a message from Ororo.

They lunched together quietly, then at the same time they turned to 
each other and said

&quot;Kitty, Storm&#39;s asked me...&quot; Rogue started.

&quot;Rogue, Ororo wants me...&quot; Kitty said.

The two looked at each other and laughed softly. Rogue made a &#39;lady&#39;s 
first&#39; gesture, and Kitty said &quot;Storm is forming a new X-team, to 
search for the Destiny diaries, and she wants me in it because of my 
research skills and our finding the first one together.&quot;

Rogue smiled slightly, &quot;Same here. Because she thinks Destiny might 
have wanted me to find them, and that my personal connection might 
give us some clues to their location.&quot;

&quot;Do you want to go?&quot; Kitty asked Rogue simply.

&quot;Yes, I do&quot; Rogue admitted, then she smiled &quot;but not without you.&quot; 
Kitty looked at her in surprise, and Rogue firmly added &quot;I don&#39;t want 
to be without you, Kitty. I meant it, when I said we were married.&quot;

Kitty hugged Rogue fiercely, and said &quot;We&#39;ll go there together, then. 
Retirement&#39;s been too boring for me, anyway.&quot;

Rogue fought tears, knowing that Kitty was sacrificing her peaceful 
life for her, and softly said &quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you, too,&quot; Kitty said tearfully. She grinned suddenly, &quot;And if 
anybody has a problem with it, they get to deal with kung-fu Kitty!&quot;

Rogue laughed as they got up and hurried back to the cabin. They had 
packing to do, preparing for their new life together, and , she 
thought with a naughty little grin, probably a very sleepless night 
ahead...



Kitty and Rogue got up out of their seats on the commercial airplane, 
both of them taking the opportunity to look out the window as their 
plane approached the airport at Sydney, Australia. The Sydney Opera 
House was a beautiful sight, along with the clear, blue water and the 
glorious sunlight, such a great change from cool New England.

&quot;Do we know who&#39;ll be meeting us?&quot; Kitty asked Rogue quietly as she 
sat back down in her chair. She pulled her seatbelt over her middle, 
just in case.

&quot;I sent them the keys to a safehouse here that Irene willed to me,&quot; 
Rogue said to Kitty quietly. &quot;I think they&#39;re just settling in, so 
Ororo wasn&#39;t sure who&#39;d be here.&quot;

&quot;Are you nervous?&quot; Kitty asked her, a little surprised.

Kitty was still getting used to seeing Rogue with her almost constant 
guard down. The normal cocky, tough girl act she used to protect 
herself was gone when Kitty was around, revealing a more hesitant, but 
sweet young woman. She wondered, in her darker moments, if Gambit had 
ever seen this side of Rogue. She honestly doubted it, though.

&quot;A little,&quot; Rogue shyly admitted. &quot;This is a very big job were taking 
on. And I&#39;m a bit worried about how they&#39;ll react to... us.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll tackle the big jobs when they come, just like always,&quot; Kitty 
said firmly. &quot;And as far as our relationship goes, I think they can 
handle it,&quot; Kitty said with a smile. She covered Rogue&#39;s hand with 
hers, their new, matching gold rings gleaming in the sunlight.

One of their more pleasant experiences on this trip was when one of 
the stewardesses noticed their matching rings. Instead of the 
explosion Kitty was almost expecting, she smiled sweetly at both of 
them and said &quot;Congratulations.&quot; Later on, she reappeared with two 
glasses of wine in real glasses for them both! They toasted each 
other, then the stewardess&#39; kindness.

Disembarking, they reclaimed their luggage from the carousel and 
quickly saw Ororo waiting there patiently for them over at the arrival 
gates. The tall woman certainly stood out in a crowd, african dark 
skin mixed with her pure white hair. She smiled over at them 
welcomingly, and as soon as they got near enough enveloped Kitty in a 
gentle but firm hug.

&quot;Kitten!&quot; Ororo said happily, &quot;It&#39;s so good to see you.&quot; She then 
looked over at Rogue and grinned at her, &quot;And Rogue, you so look a 
great deal better than when I last saw you. May I ask how the vacation 
was?&quot;

Kitty squirmed free of the hug and grinned up at Ororo cheerfully as 
she answered &quot;Kitty, not &#39;Kitten&#39;, please, Ororo. I&#39;ve grown up a 
little bit, you know.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll always be my &#39;Kitten&#39; to me,&quot; Ororo answered her quietly. 
Rogue looked at the two of them and realized how maternal Ororo was to 
Kitty, how much like another mother she was to her. Ororo looked over 
at Rogue and smiled, but she instantly noticed Rogue wasn&#39;t wearing 
her usual pair of protective gloves.

Rogue flushed a bit under her gaze, slipping her gloves on quickly. 
But before she did, she took her ring off, and then put it back on 
over her gloved finger. &#39;I&#39;m not just standing here in front of my 
teammate and leader,&#39; Rogue thought to herself as she looked over at 
Ororo, &#39;I&#39;m also here in front of my love&#39;s surrogate mother, so to 
speak.&#39;

Rogue nodded to her as she answered Ororo&#39;s earlier question, &quot;The 
vacation was great. I&#39;ve got a handle on the powers situation, and 
Kitty has helped teach me a lot.&quot; She said the last with a little wink 
at Kitty, making her blush.

Ororo looked back and forth between them, an odd look on her face. 
&quot;Rogue,&quot; she asked hesitantly, &quot;why weren&#39;t you wearing your gloves?&quot;

&quot;New trick,&quot; Kitty jumped in, and reached over to caress Rogue&#39;s bare 
cheek with her finger tips. &quot;I guess we&#39;re both still a bit giddy.&quot;

Ororo looked at the two of them blankly a moment, then a slow smile 
spread across her face. &quot;Are any congratulations in order?&quot; she asked 
the two of them, grinning.

Kitty quickly looked around, and noticed they were standing in a 
quieter section of the large airport. She boldly stepped up to Rogue, 
wrapped her arms around the surprised girl&#39;s neck, and pulled Rogue 
down into a very vigorous looking kiss! Rogue&#39;s half-hearted attempts 
at struggling free made it look even funnier, and a fiercely blushing 
Ororo had to fight the urge to laugh.

Kitty finally released her, and Rogue gasped for breath. &quot;Uhm, sorry,&quot; 
Rogue said to the still faintly blushing Ororo, &quot;but we&#39;re still sort 
of honeymooning.&quot;

Ororo laughed with them softly. &quot;I think it&#39;s perfectly 
understandable,&quot; she cheerfully assured the two of them

They walked together quietly towards the jeep Ororo drove there in, 
until finally Kitty hesitantly asked her, &quot;Ororo, are you OK with 
this?&quot;

Ororo smiled at them warmly, and said with clear sincerity &quot;I&#39;m happy 
for you both. I noticed the rings, did you two have a ceremony?&quot;

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Rogue answered smiling, &quot;we wanted to get all our friends 
together first.&quot;

&quot;That may be a while, with everything that&#39;s been happening, but we&#39;ll 
try. Have you told your parents?&quot; Ororo asked Kitty quietly.

&quot;No,&quot; Kitty answered, then she paused a moment. With a faint blush she 
shyly admitted &quot;I really wanted to tell you first.&quot;

&#39;Just the right thing to say,&#39; Rogue thought, as Ororo smiled over at 
Kitty with tears in her eyes. She was a bit startled when Ororo looked 
over at her thoughtfully.

&quot;And have you told Mystique yet?&quot; Ororo asked her curiously. Rogue 
blinked at her, looking rather surprised.

&quot;As soon as I figure out how,&quot; Rogue said sheepishly. Having a 
criminal for a mother did create certain communication problems, and 
she didn&#39;t want to discuss something this personal in a letter. They 
talked about lighter matters until they reached the beach front 
mansion that Rogue had inherited from Irene Alder. They each grabbed a 
bag and headed up to the large front door, opening it to many cries of 
greeting.

Bishop gave them each a respectful nod and small, friendly smile. The 
time lost african-american X-Man still had a little bit of hero 
worship in his eyes at working beside the heroes of his youth, but to 
be honest Rogue kind of liked that. The X-men may have had some 
problems with his gun- wielding methods in the past, but over the 
years he had become a steady, reliable teammate both of them had 
worked well with.

Psylocke stepped forward, her long purple hair swinging around her as 
she politely shook hands with both of them. Elizabeth Braddock was a 
walking contradiction, a proper English Lady who was merged body and 
soul with a ninja warrior. Her eyes instantly took in the rings, how 
Kitty and Rogue stood together, and the former assassin just filed the 
information away, neither approving of them nor condemning.

Sage nodded slightly to them both, while the pale, black hared woman 
still kept a safe degree of distance between them. Once she had fought 
the X-men as Tessa, alongside the infamous Hellfire Club of Manhattan, 
some of the X-men&#39;s deadliest foes.

Now, however, Sage had joined their ranks and made the shocking 
revelation that she had always been an deep cover agent working on 
behalf of Prof. Xavier himself. She was a living computer with the 
unique ability to jump-start a mutant&#39;s powers to their next level, 
and her talents would very likely be invaluable in the search for the 
Destiny diaries, but still, Kitty and Rogue both didn&#39;t fully trust 
her just yet.

Thunderbird smiled and waved cheerfully at them from the door of the 
nearby kitchen. The young Mediterranean recruit was very powerful, and 
was working hard on controlling his super heated plasma abilities, but 
still seemed like such a rookie. But Neal Sharra had already faced 
much alongside the X-men, and he was growing up very fast.

&quot;The upper floor rooms are still open,&quot; Sage said with a smile. &quot;The 
rest of us have pretty much taken the ground floor rooms.&quot;

Neal blushed a bit as Elizabeth cozied up to his side, &quot;But I&#39;m sure 
somebody could trade with you if you&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;So the master suite upstairs is still open?&quot; Rogue asked them in 
confirmation. At Bishop&#39;s grave nod she grinned, &quot;Good, then Kitty and 
I&#39;ll be sharing it.&quot; Kitty picked up her bags, Rogue grabbed hers and 
they both headed upstairs.

Behind them, a confused sounding Neal asked the others softly &quot;Why are 
they sharing when there&#39;s two rooms available?&quot;

Elizabeth&#39;s very amused voice answered him with another question 
instead &quot;Why are we sharing a room, love?&quot;

&quot;Because...&quot; he started, then silence. Then a surprised sounding, 
&quot;Oh!&quot;

Kitty closed the bedroom door, looked over at Rogue, and broke into a 
fit of giggles. Rogue tried to keep a straight face a few moments 
longer but finally gave in and laughed too. &quot;I guess we won&#39;t be 
keeping our relationship a deep, dark secret,&quot; a smiling Kitty said, 
after finally getting the fits of laughter under control.

&quot;No, I guess staying in the closet isn&#39;t in the cards for us,&quot; Rogue 
agreed as she wiped the last tears of laughter from her eyes.

They unpacked side by side, touching each other every so often as they 
worked. They quickly had their bags emptied and all the clothes packed 
away, then they took a moment to sit on the bed and relax after the 
long flight there.

&quot;You know what I think I&#39;ll miss most from the cabin?&quot; Kitty asked 
Rogue, leaning her head on her shoulder. Rogue placed her arm over 
Kitty&#39;s shoulders, holding her gently.

&quot;Besides your massive anime collection?&quot; a smiling Rogue asked her 
teasingly, taking a moment to ruffle her collar length brown hair.

Kitty punched her shoulder, then smiled a naughty smile as she 
whispered softly in Rogue&#39;s ear &quot;Ravaging you in front of the 
fireplace.&quot;

Rogue blushed neon red.

The two of them then got up to get changed. Getting of their sweaty 
travel clothes, they changed into their newly made X-men team 
uniforms. Rogue had chosen a skintight red and black bodysuit for her, 
and Kitty wore a similar design done up in blue and black. Shadowcat 
was back, the stealth fighter supreme! They walked down the stairs 
together, hand in hand to the welcoming smiles of their teammates.

&#39;There may be some bumps ahead,&#39; Kitty thought as she and Rogue sat 
down beside their long-time friends for their first real meeting, &#39;but 
I do think things are going to work out just fine.&#39; She smiled over at 
Rogue, who smiled back, &#39;Just fine.&#39;

In another part of the island continent, a handsome young man emerges 
from a secluded bar in the bad part of town. &quot;Lovely ladies,&quot; Gambit 
said, looking around at the crowd, &quot;a mansion to case and adventures 
to be had.&quot;

Gambit walked aimlessly for a bit until he passed a newspaper box and 
stopped, frozen at the prominent headline. In bold letters it read 
&quot;The X- Men return to Oz!&quot;

&quot;I wonder if she&#39;s there with them,&quot; Gambit said to himself softly. He 
smiled a bit, &quot;I guess there&#39;s only one way to find out.&quot;



A week later, prison gates opened and a young woman walked out into 
the sunlight dressed in a plain gray dress. Raven Darkholme took a 
deep breath of air, then looked around her with a happy smile on her 
face. She was glad being a shapeshifter meant you had plenty of 
oportunities to dig up dirt on people.

She sighed a bit. She certainly had to call a lot of favors in to get 
out of jail this time, though! She was really wondering if it might be 
time to get out of the business, while she still could. She checked 
for anyone concealed nearby, then cautiously reached into a pocket and 
pulled out a plain sealed letter. She popped it open and a airplane 
ticket along with a small, folded sheet of paper fell right into her 
hands.

She opened the letter with shaking hands, unfolding it completely 
before she would let herself look at the words and read them.

Raven, A great opportunity awaits you, if you are willing to go where 
this ticket will send you. I wish you to be happy there, and hope you 
have the chance to know true love again. I love you, Irene

Raven blinked, wiping at her eyes with the back of her hand. She 
didn&#39;t know how many of these letters Destiny had written before her 
death, but they always turned up when they were needed and were almost 
always right. She sniffled a bit, they always effected her the same 
way, too. She then turned over the ticket, and she saw it was a one 
way trip to the city of Sydney, Australia. &#39;I guess I could use some 
sun,&#39; a smiling Raven thought, and climbed in to the complementary 
taxi the prison system had waiting for her. &quot;To the airport, please,&quot; 
she said to the driver.
