<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/brainbeauty-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>5: ON THE FIFTH DAY (Try To Understand) 

&quot;So you want out,&quot; said Jane, &quot;yet you enjoy having sex with the queen 
of The Fashionistas. A definite Scylla and Charibdes choice, to say the 
least.&quot;

Daria and Jane, were having their per usual pizza at the Pizza King. 
Right now, even while The Byrds&#39; My Back Pages was playing in the 
background, the auburn had related to her friend the quandry she was in 
and her meeting with Amy and Eiji.

&quot;A part of me,&quot; said Daria, &quot; wants to buy some jewery and settlle down 
with Sandi, and all in the name of a sexual high, and the other half 
wants to flee to Transvaal and hide out in their diamond mines. And yet, 
it was that kiss that showed me and Sandi how the other half lives. I 
know that the sex gives me something.......that I had never felt 
before.....and if you say, &#39;Oh dear, our girl&#39;s becoming a woman,&#39; I&#39;ll 
kick your butt.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d think I&#39;d be stupid to do that?&quot; said the artist. &quot;I think what 
it is, is that you&#39;re feeling the guilt of what you did last night, yet 
you enjoy the pleasure that goes with it. Listen, if you wanna break up 
the easy way, why not call The Chicken Breakup Service?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a telegram service where a delivery person, dressed up like a 
chicken, delivers a telegram to one you wanna break up with. You could 
say it&#39;s one way of telling Sandi that her love&#39;s flown the coop.&quot;

&quot;&quot;Thanks but I don&#39;t think Sandi is likely to fall for that.&quot; Sighing, 
the auburn got up saying, &quot;I got to use the toilet.&quot;

&quot;Wait up, amiga,&quot; said Jane. &quot;We must have synchronized bladders.&quot;

Having answered nature&#39;s call in The Pizza King&#39;s toilets, Daria and 
Jane were ready to exit each other&#39;s stalls, when they heard some 
breathy squeals coming from the toilet stall at the end.

&quot;Jane.....,&quot; said Daria. &quot;There&#39;s someone in the toilet.&quot;

&quot;It sure ain&#39;t Goldilocks,&quot; said Jane.

Upon peering through a crack in the stall door, they saw, on the toilet, 
her blouse, bra, jeans and panty half off, Quinn, masturbating with one 
hand and holding a photo of Sandi in a string bikini in the other.

&quot;Great googa mooga.....&quot; said the artist. &quot;And we thought Sandi was the 
only bi in Lawndale.........&quot;

&quot;Mmmm.......,&quot; murmured the cynic. &quot;So i wasn&#39;t the only one in love 
with The Fashion Queen.&quot;

&quot;What makes you think she&#39;s in love with Sandi?&quot;

&quot;Listen to what&#39;s she saying.&quot;

How right she was--for Quinn was breathily sighing, &quot;Oh Sandi.........I 
wish it was you, making love to 
me.......oh.....oh....oh....ohhhhhh.....!!&quot; Her vagina was gushing 
fluids while her index and center finger went in and out, sometimes 
caressing the clit, other times tweaking her strawberry sized nipple.

&quot;She&#39;s got it bad,&quot; said Jane. &quot;Seems you ain&#39;t the only one with the 
hots for Sandi.&quot;

&quot;Jane......get a life....,&quot; said a terse Daria.

Quinn was reaching the peak of her sexual high, throwing her head back 
before she wailed, &quot;OHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; From there, she 
convulsed before she came in the toilet--and that was when the cynic and 
the artist sneaked out, heading to their table.

&quot;Boy, can you believe that?&quot; said Jane. &quot;If Sandi knew she ain&#39;t the 
only lezzie in love, she&#39;d turn off of you, and turn on to Quinn.&quot;

&quot;And that,&quot; said Daria hopefully, &quot;could be the solution.....&quot;

Time passed upon arriving at House Morgendorffer. Quinn had gone on her 
date at 6:00 P. M., and no sooner had Daria&#39;s sister departed, a knock 
on the door brought Sandi who said, &quot;Hi, sweetie.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s on your mind? Your brothers stole your Waif collection?&quot;

&quot;If they did, I&#39;d bust their butts silly. Anyhow, since your folks and 
mine will be, like, home tomorrow, I figured we&#39;d make our last moment 
here something to remember--under your glowing stars.&quot;

&quot;Under the glowing stars? Oh, you mean those glowing stars Jane did for 
me.&quot;

&quot;Yup. But first--&quot; here Sandi&#39;s voice changed to a breathy murmur--&quot; I 
got something you&#39;re going to love......&quot; From there, the brunette took 
the auburn&#39;s hand, then the other one, and led her upstairs. 

I find myself in a strange situation
and I don&#39;t know how
What seemed to be an infatuation
is so different now
I can&#39;t get by if we&#39;re not together
Ooh can&#39;t you see
Girl, I want you now and forever
close to me

What happened next was indeed something Daria would never forget. 

For Sandi had led her into the bathroom where they showered together, 
using scented jasmine liquid soap, each girl caressing each other and 
lathering up each other&#39;s body, with slow caresses, starting with the 
brunette taking her time with rubbing, tweaking and caressing the auburn 
from behind, her soft creamy hand sending waves of passion all over her. 
Right now, one hand was in and out from Daria&#39;s vagina and clit, which 
were dripping with water and fluid while the other was all over her 
body, tweaking and fondling her breasts and nipples.

&quot;MMMMMM.....you like that, do you, sweetie?&quot; said Sandi, who was kissing 
from time to time, Daria&#39;s cheek, neck, ear lobe (and sticking her 
tongue in her ear now and then) and mouth. 

&quot;So gooooood.....&quot; was all the auburn could say.

I&#39;m longing for the time
I&#39;m longing for the day
hoping that you will promise to be mine
and never go away

Then it was Daria&#39;s turn to do everything the brunette did to her--from 
kissing to fondling her whole body; needless to say, all that worked 
magic on a groaning and sighing Sandi, who was murmuring, &quot;Oh, 
Daaaaaaa----------ria.......!! It&#39;s so good when you treat me so 
sweet.....give me more......clean me out....&quot;

And Daria did just that--kneeling before Sandi&#39;s vagina and sucked, 
licked and kissed that, along with the clitoris, often probing her 
tongue way deep in the folds till the brunette was shaking all over 
gasping and calling out in her birdsong passion. Then the auburn sucked 
and kissed the Fashion Clubber&#39;s breasts and nipples till the brunette&#39;s 
sighs and moans were at the point of breaking the sound barrier.

From there, Sandi did the same to Daria&#39;s vagina and clit till the 
latter was writhing in the worst way--and again, her cynic walls gave 
way to the sexual highs that surged through her body. And when the 
brunette went for the breasts and nipples, the auburn found herself 
unable to hold back a cry of pleasure.

After that, the girls faced each other, holding and french kissing under 
the shower water........yet aware that it would be their last time 
together...... 

I don&#39;t want to live without you
I don&#39;t want to live without you
I could never live without you
Live without your love

After drying each other off, along with their hair, the girls headed to 
Daria&#39;s bedroom where under the glow of the black light and the stars 
overhead, shared some peeled orange slices with a kiss, while Sandi lay 
her head between the auburn&#39;s breasts. From there they went into a 69 
pose, probing their tongues so deep into each other&#39;s vaginas, their 
tongues drawing in the juices. After several minutes of that, Sandi had 
Daria lay on her back, her head almost over the foot of the bed before 
deep French kissing her, each kiss longer than the last one, for the 
dread of what was ahead afterwards. Next, the brunette nibbled, licked, 
rubbed, drooled kissed and sucked the auburn&#39;s breasts and nipples till 
they were way beyond stiff, Daria relaxing and enjoying the firey 
passionate feelings that enveloped her. 

Soon after that, the diva went down on the cynic&#39;s hard clit, orally 
teasing it and sucking it before plunging her tongue way deep in the 
vagina, causing Daria to writhe with pleasure, her breathy cry sounding 
like the mew of a kitten. 

I ask myself but there&#39;s no explanation
for the way I feel
I know I&#39;ve reached the right destination
and I know it&#39;s real

I&#39;m longing for the time
I&#39;m longing for the day
when I&#39;ll be giving you this heart of mine
Believe me when I say

Daria was groaning and sighing when Sandi brought her to the highest sex 
level, before she came all over the diva&#39;s face. After that, the girls 
switched so that Sandi was laying down, her head almost over the foot of 
the bed, and Daria was the pleasure giver, starting with tweaking the 
nipples before licking and kissing them till the brunette was making 
breathy squeals. &quot;Oh, Daria.......rub my breasts good.........rub them 
for me&quot;

The auburn rubbed, caressed, kneaded and squeezed the diva&#39;s breasts, 
causing the nipples to swell even harder--and that was when Daria licked 
the said nipples, making them even more harder, and Sandi to gasp, &quot;Oh, 
it&#39;s so good, lovergirl!! I love that!!&quot;

That was when the auburn clamped down on one of the breasts, and sucked 
harder than before, making the brunette pitch her head back with a cry. 
&quot;Don&#39;t stop!!&quot; she gasped. &quot;Please, don&#39;t stop!! It&#39;s gooooooood!!&quot;

Indeed Daria sucked both breasts so hungrily, Sandi was hit with a high 
that felt like she had been pinned to the ceiling--but that wasn&#39;t 
compared when the auburn fingered the brunette&#39;s vagina which was juicy 
like a fruit gushing with fluid. No wonder the diva was breathing out, 
&quot;Give it to me so gooooood.....!! I want more, lovergirl.....it&#39;s 
so--------!!&quot;

When Daria went down and sucked Sandi&#39;s clit, the brunette&#39;s squeals 
were more and more louder, and heavier with love: 
&quot;Ohhhhhhhhhh.............Daaaa-riaaaaaaaa.... make me come.........suck 
it good and harrrrrrrd....!!&quot;

After pleasing the diva&#39;s clit, the cynic went fulll tilt, way beyond 
deep, heavy strike deep in the brunette&#39;s vagina, causing Sandi to 
writhe, gasp and moan, &quot;OHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.......!!&quot;

On and on Daria drove Sandi to the highest sexual peak, till the 
brunette called out, &quot;Oh baby........I am goin&#39; to come.....!!&quot;

And come she did, her vaginal fluids drenching the auburn in the face. 
But even so, that didn&#39;t stop the cynic from laying on to of the diva, 
her leg on top of Sandi&#39;s vagina and clit, while Daria&#39;s vagina and clit 
was on top of the brunette&#39;s leg. From there, the brunette licked all 
the love fluid from the auburn&#39;s face before saying, &quot;Mmmmmmmmm......so 
delicious....&quot;

&quot;Now I know what a tongue bath&#39;s like,&quot; said the cynic.

I don&#39;t want to live without you
I don&#39;t want to live without you
I could never live without you
Live without your love

No I don&#39;t want to live without you
I don&#39;t want to live without you
I could never live without you
Live without your love

Moving her body so that her crotch was rubbing along the brunette&#39;s leg, 
the auburn rubbed her leg along Sandi&#39;s crotch at the same time; as it 
was with the scissors kick method used at The Red Barchetta Hotel, the 
new method was building up a lot of love fluid and passion, the girls 
holding and French kissing as before, writhing and calling out in 
breathy birdsong passion.

&quot;O-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh-------!!&quot; breathed Sandi. &quot;I love you, Daria!! Give me 
more, give me EVERYTHING.....!! Oh, baby......my lovergirl, my sweetie, 
my angel, my Daria baby..........mmmmmmmmmmm.......!!&quot;

&quot;Faster........got to come......!!&quot; said Daria.

Faster and faster, more and more passionate than before, the girls were 
rubbing each other&#39;s vaginas and clits with their legs, never breaking 
their hug, kissing from time to time. As before, they were in a huge 
surging time warp of love and sex that took them to an all time high, 
wave after wave of sexual pleasure enveloping them in thier highest 
peak, as if it would be their last hurrah.

&quot;I AM COMING!!!!&quot; called Sandi. &quot;AIEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;T-tell me all &#39;bout......it.....!!&quot; gasped Daria. 
&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!&quot;

No sooner had they said that, the girls were violently shaking and 
writhing wildly with absolute abandon, when the ultimate orgasm tore 
though them, while vaginal fluids poured out, squirting all over 
themselves, while they kissed one last kiss.

Now I don&#39;t want to live without you
I don&#39;t want to live without you
I could never be without you
Be without your love

I don&#39;t want to live without you
Live without your love
Live without your love
You see I&#39;m lost without your love

Ooh....oh
Without your love

Their high leveling off, Daria and Sandi traded gentle but loving kisses 
while holding each other. The end. For the moment, it seemed as if time 
stood still. 

Having showered, dried and dressed, the auburn and the brunette were at 
the front door. During that whole time however, Daria had been thinking 
on how to break it to Sandi. The fact she had glasses--and no one in 
one&#39;s right mind would hit someone with glasses--she hoped Sandi 
wouldn&#39;t punch her. Just now, the cynic started to open the door, when 
the diva reached out and took her hand.

&quot;Sandi, it&#39;s late,&quot; said Daria. &quot;Quinn will be home soon, and besides, 
my folks will be home tomorrow. How&#39;s that for the latest article on 
Sick Sad World?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d care. Like, I love you....and I want you.&quot;

&quot;Even a geeky brain like me? You know, in a way, considering that we&#39;re 
of different worlds, all it took was a kiss just to win a bet with your 
fellow Fashion Clubbers--and to see how the other half lives. Maybe we 
DID learn something from each other, who knows?&quot;

For the first time in years, Sandi had been somber in what she had been 
saying since that first kiss with Daria; right now, she said, &quot;Like, who 
knows indeed? Still, I can&#39;t be a better person, just as you can&#39;t 
conform to what is popular and fashionable. Like, it&#39;s too late for me, 
Daria.&quot;

&quot;Maybe, maybe not. I can&#39;t help it if I am a cynic just as you can&#39;t 
help it if you&#39;re a diva. They&#39;re the only ways we can live in such a 
sick sad world, I guess.&quot;

The brunette could only laugh before saying, &quot;Oh!! You.......!!&quot; and 
headed for the door--before she turned to the auburn and said, &quot;When 
will I see you again?&quot;

For Daria, the time was now. Break it to her gently and hang the 
outcome, The Misery Chick way--so with that in mind, she said bluntly:

&quot;You won&#39;t, Sandi. You can&#39;t see me again. It&#39;s over between me and 
you.&quot;

&quot;WHAT.........?!?&quot;

&quot;Please.......try to understand......it&#39;s all over.&quot;

As expected, the brunette&#39;s face now had the meanest look, her voice 
seething with a tone that left no room for mercy. &quot;Daria, that is so 
unfair of you, I CANNOT believe you&#39;d do that to me, after all the love 
we shared, you hang me out to dry!!!!&quot; 

&quot;At least listen.&quot;

Her face red, her voice twixt anguish and rage, Sandi growled, &quot;Listen 
to what, you %@#*^&amp;$ BITCH!! You said you loved me!! I went out of my 
way for you, and you don&#39;t love me?!? #%@*^$&amp;!! Is that the &amp;^*$#@% 
thanks I get?!?&quot;

&quot;Try to understand. I am an unpopular geeky brain, and you&#39;re a popular 
shallow beauty. You and your fashion drones, save for my sister, weren&#39;t 
friends of mine. We&#39;re of different classes, and different ages, 
lifestyles, along with the fact I&#39;ll be heading to collage soon. 
Besides, I love Tom, and the way I see it, now that we got what we came 
for, it&#39;s best we break it off, before it gets out of hand. And yet, I 
don&#39;t know why I still want more.&quot;

Bunching her hand into a fist, the diva hissed &quot;You %@#$&amp;^*....!!&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t hit a gal with glasses, would you?&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, we Griffins don&#39;t believe in superstitions.&quot; Swinging a 
fist, Sandi started to punch Daria, who jumped from its path, and the 
brunette lunged at the hapless auburn, falling to the couch, grabbing 
the front of the cynic&#39;s coat and shouting through her sobs: &quot;I HATE 
YOU!!!! I HATE YOU!!!! I HATED YOU SINCE YOU AND QUINN FIRST CAME HERE, 
I HATED YOU SINCE YOU YOU WERE THAT ACTING TEACHER WHEN ALL THE OTHER 
TEACHERS WERE ON STRIKE, AND I HATE YOU EVEN TODAY, EVEN NOW......!!!!&quot;

Somehow all the vehemence turned out to be an outlet for blowing off 
steam, for in the next instant, Sandi&#39;s rage turned to tears, which were 
streaming down her face, before she flung her arms &#39;round a bewildered 
Daria and cried as hard as she could.

&quot;I said it before,&quot; said the auburn, &quot;and I&#39;ll say it again--you don&#39;t 
need to cry &#39;bout that.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Daria,&quot; sobbed the brunette, &quot;I wanted to break off from you 
myself; I was aware as you were, that it was over, that our love was 
never meant to be, that we were of different worlds....and that it was 
best that I wanted out of that affair as you did, yet a part of me 
wanted more of the love and passion we once shared.........and that part 
is saying....that....I love you....I don&#39;t wanna be without 
you.........y-you were my first love, my first kiss....and to break up 
from that....it&#39;s sad to say goodby.......but what hurts me is that you 
broke off from me first, before I could tell you our romance was over.&quot;

&quot;What difference does it make who said it?&quot; said Daria. &quot;Be it with 
straight, lesbian, or even gay romances, there&#39;s a lot of other fish in 
the sea--or words to that effect. Me and Trent had a thing for a moment, 
but we became just friends while he got engaged to Monique. Tom used to 
be Jane&#39;s lover till he turned on to me; that almost ruined mine and 
Jane&#39;s friendship, but we made up. These day&#39;s she&#39;s dating Jesse 
Moreno. Believe me, I know there&#39;s someone that loves you.&quot;

Lifting her tear drenched face, Sandi stared at Daria before sobbing, 
&quot;D-Daria........&quot;, only to relapse and cry sadly on the auburn&#39;s 
shoulder.

&quot;Listen, Sandi,&quot; said the cynic, &quot;remember when you said you fell in 
love with me and Quinn? What if I were to tell you that Quinn was 
secretly in love with you?&quot;

Getting up, the brunette stared through her drying tears and said, 
&quot;What? Quinn in love with me?&quot;

&quot;Believe me,&quot; said the auburn,&quot;it&#39;s no lie--Jane was a witness when she 
and I saw her masturbating to a bikinied photo of you in The Pizza 
King&#39;s bathroom.&quot;

&quot;Quinn did THAT?!? You sure you didn&#39;t make up such a half baked tale 
like that, just to get rid of me?&quot;

&quot;If you don&#39;t believe me, you, Quinn and your fashion drones meet me and 
Jane in the bathroom tomorrow. I think it&#39;s time we placed our cards on 
the table. If I am right, Quinn may be the solution.&quot;

&quot;And if you ain&#39;t?&quot;

Thinking carefully, Daria replied, &quot;Then you got me still, despite the 
odds, plus you got the right to kick my butt with those fancy shoes of 
yours.&quot;

For a moment, Sandi mulled over that while drying her eyes, then said, 
&quot;Like, I&#39;ll give you a chance--but I&#39;ll enjoy the pleasure of kicking 
your butt if you&#39;re mistaken--BOOM!!&quot;

&quot;Whatever,&quot; said the cynic. 

On that, the diva got up, opened the front door, and went out, closing 
it. Then, just as Daria turned to the kitchen, there was a knock on the 
door; opening it, she saw Sandi, who said, &quot;Like, by the 
way..........thank you for everything.&quot;

From there, she hugged the auburn before fully kissing her on the mouth 
one last time and ran down the street. 

After closing the door, Daria picked up the phone, and placed a call to 
Jane who picked up her phone saying, &quot;Yo.&quot;

&quot;Jane,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;It&#39;s time we move fast, and your help is a 
must for tomorrow.&quot;

Friday, the fifth day brought Sandi, Quinn, Tiffany and Stacy entering 
the bathroom, where Daria and Jane stood; nearby was a huge tank type 
vacuum on casters, and a long hose. Behind them, the grill for the air 
vent had been removed and was near the sink.

&quot;OK, like what&#39;s on your mind?&quot; said Sandi.

&quot;Why&#39;d you tell me to come here?&quot; said Quinn.

&quot;What&#39;s the secret?&quot; said Tiffany.

&quot;And what you mean by placin&#39; the cards on the table?&quot; said Stacy.

&quot;Shh,&quot; said Daria &quot;Just listen.&quot;

Needless to say, the faint sounds of Kevin and Brittany smooching it up 
could be heard.

&quot;Kevin and Brittany,&quot; said Quinn.

&quot;In the air vents?&quot; said Stacy.

&quot;Then that means they DID evesdrop.....brr!!&quot; said Tiffany.

&quot;Then that means.......oh no, they overheard....!!&quot; said Sandi, who now 
clenched her fists.. &quot;I&#39;ll pound them silly!! No court is goin&#39; to 
convict me!!&quot;

&quot;Settle down, S. G.,&quot; said Daria. &quot;Sure, the story they told is real, 
BUT....if you truly wanna get back at them for what they did, there&#39;s 
such a thing as the right way.&quot;

&quot;And which IS the right way?,&quot; haughtily demanded the brunette.

Pointing to the vacuum, Jane replied, &quot;See that vacuum? I just borrowed 
it from the janitor, and it&#39;s full of dust. Right now, I just took the 
hose off the vacuum, and placed it on exhaust. Quinn, can you take the 
cord and plug it in that wall outlet? Daria, can you stand on that sink 
and stick the hose in the air vent?&quot;

&quot;And how is that %@#$&amp;*^ setup going to help me?!?&quot; said Sandi.

&quot;Just stand by that switch on the vacuum,&quot; said the artist, &quot; and wait 
for my signal.&quot; To Daria, who was standing on one of the sinks, one hand 
aiming the vacuum hose in the vent, she added, &quot;Just follow my lead, 
amiga.&quot;

&quot;As you wish,&quot; said the cynic.

&quot;So, Daria,&quot; said Jane, &quot;you&#39;re thinking of breaking up with Sandi, 
right?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; said Daria, in the hopes Brittany and Kevin would hear. &quot;Sandi 
may be sweet on me, but she&#39;s way too sweet for a brain like me.&quot;

As expected, Brittany could be faintly heard from the vent with, &quot;That 
sucks!!&quot;, followed with Kevin saying, &quot;Oh, man!! Daria&#39;s goin&#39; 
splitsville with Sandi!!&quot;

Turning to Sandi, Jane hissed, &quot;Turn on the vacuum!!&quot;

&quot;With pleasure,&quot; said the brunette before she switched on the vacuum, 
which belched clouds of black coal dust from the hose, into the air 
vent; in seconds, the sound of Brittany and Kevin coughing could be 
heard. After a few seconds passed, the artist said, &quot;Turn it off,&quot; and 
Sandi did just that.

Jumping off the sink, Daria said, &quot;Guess those jock jokers learned the 
folly of evesdropping.&quot; Then to the group, she added, &quot;Everyone, listen 
to me. I am Daria Morgendorffer, local brain and cynic of Lawndale.&quot;

&quot;And I am Sandi Jillian Griffin,&quot; said Sandi, &quot;the president of The 
Fashion Club, back from sabbatical.......and what started it all was a 
bet and a kiss. But, when me and Daria kissed, we got more than we 
bargined for.....we also learned how the other half lives,&quot;

After that, the diva and the cynic revealed to Quinn and co.the fact 
that Sandi was a lesbian, and her crush on Daria and her sister. When 
they had finished, Stacy gasped, &quot;Y-you mean....?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re saying YOU had a crush on me?&quot; said Quinn.

&quot;You&#39;re joking.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;ve thought?&quot; said Tiffany.

Hanging her head, Sandi said somberly, &quot;It&#39;s no joke, Quinn. I do love 
you......and I want you to kiss me.&quot;

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEW!!!! Now I know you&#39;re joking!!&quot;

&quot;Like Sandi said,&quot; stated Daria, &quot;it&#39;s no joke. So I bet you couldn&#39;t 
kiss her full on the mouth. Like you said, a bet&#39;s a bet.&quot;

&quot;That was what started the whole thing in the first place,&quot; said Quinn. 

&quot;Gee, Quinn,&quot; said the brunette, &quot;if you ain&#39;t got any love for me, much 
less the courage to kiss me, you ain&#39;t got the potential to be vice 
president of The Fashion Club.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean I ain&#39;t?!? I&#39;ll show you!!&quot; So saying, the redhead 
flung her arms &#39;round Sandi and kissed her full, hot, deep and hard on 
the mouth; from there, the brunette held her friend at the waist, the 
two kissing gently at first, and then with more feeling and more 
intensity, the wave of passion enveloping them, each girl running her 
fingers through each other&#39;s hair.

&quot;Here we go again,&quot; said Tiffany.

&quot;WOOOOOOO--------------OOOOW!!&quot; said Stacy.

For that matter neither girl wanted to stop kissing, so there was no 
doubt they were enjoying it.

&quot;What do you think, Daria?&quot; said Jane.

&quot;I&#39;d say our work is done,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;We&#39;ve come full circle, 
finishing just as it started--with a bet and a kiss. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

Replacing the grill back on the vent, Daria and Jane took the vacuum, 
hose, cord and all and exited the bathroom--just in time to see. 
Brittany and Kevin shake the black soot and dust from themselves. 

&quot;Who was it that said an elephant wedding wouldn&#39;t work out? Pachyderms 
pledge their love before the altar, next on Sick Sad World!!&quot;

Laying on the bed inside Jane&#39;s bedroom, Daria and her partner in crime 
were checking out the boob tube for their fave show. In the distance, 
the bell tower of The Red Barchetta Hotel could be heard.

&quot;So it seems your sister patched up Sandi&#39;s heart in no time,&quot; said 
Jane.

&quot;Yup,&quot; replied Daria. &quot;Which means ol&#39; S. G.&#39;s back to her old spoiled 
self. Now I can make up for lost time with Tom, till it&#39;s time for 
collage.&quot;

&quot;So I guess all worked for the best. Too bad it was Sandi and not me 
that could&#39;ve made all that fantastic love.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Jane, don&#39;t tell you wanna kiss me? That was what started the whole 
thing in the first place.&quot;

&quot;Why not? Seeing you and the diva queen got me wonderin&#39; what it&#39;s like 
to kiss you.&quot;

Just then there was a knock on the door; upon heading down the stairs, 
Daria and Jane, to their surprise, saw The Fashion Club--with a white 
flag attached to a stick in Sandi&#39;s hand.

&quot;Now I know I wish I had my camcorder,&quot; said the artist.

&quot;You snooze, you lose,&quot; said the cynic.

Inside Jane&#39;s bedroom, Daria, Jane, Stacy, Tiffany, Sandi and Quinn were 
in a group.

&quot;So what brings you fashion freaks, of all people, to Casa Lane?&quot; said 
the artist.

&quot;As much as it hurts the reputation of The Fashion Club,&quot; stammered 
Sandi, &quot;we came to say........thanks for everything.....and to your 
friend Daria for setting me up with the one I was meant to love--Quinn.&quot; 
From there, she kissed the redhead&#39;s cheek.

&quot;And,&quot; said Quinn, the redhead, &quot;for making my dreams of loving Sandi.&quot;

&quot;And, &quot; said Tiffany, &quot;for revealing the fact that me and Stacy were 
born lovers.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no!!&quot; said the auburn. 

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you--,&quot; said the artist.

&quot;--now love each other,&quot; said Stacy. &quot;Seeing Sandi and Quinn kiss kinda 
sparked our curiousity, so me and Tiffany tried to kiss each other--and 
we loved it!! It&#39;s like tasting a sweet fruit.&quot;

&quot;Who was it that said,&quot; said Sandi in her stuck up way, &quot;that it 
couldn&#39;t be any of you girls?&quot;

&quot;Seems like,&quot; said Daria, &quot;Lawndale&#39;s teenage lesbian community just 
jumped up to 52%.&quot;

&quot;Better make that 54%,&quot; said Jane. Turning to her friend and cupping her 
face, she said, &quot;Kiss me, Daria.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no, Jane!! Not you too!!&quot; squawked the cynic.

&quot;Gee, Daria,&quot; said Quinn. &quot;A bet&#39;s a bet, you know.&quot;

&quot;Besides,&quot; said the artist, &quot;if Sandi and co. can do it, so can we.&quot;

&quot;Et tu, Jane? &quot;

&quot;Well........why not?&quot;

&quot;One of these days, Jane.....&quot; The rest of Daria&#39;s words were lost in 
the big deep intense kiss she and Jane shared --and it was a french 
kiss, no less. Just as it was with Sandi, Daria fell quickly to the rush 
of passionate love that overtook her, resulting in her and her friend 
taking off all their clothing and lingerie.

Night after night
I try to make it all fit together
Night after night
I see you as someone I remember
You took me by surprise,
opened up my eyes,
now we gotta talk this over.

Spurred by Daria and Jane&#39;s would be love, The Fashion Club followed 
suit, each girl stripping till they were all naked and kissing fiecrely, 
all six girls on Jane&#39;s bed, Daria kissing Jane, Sandi kissing Quinn and 
Stacy kissing Tiffany.Each girl was holding and french kissing like 
there was no tomorrow, moaning in each other&#39;s kiss. After an hour of 
that, the girls got into a daisy chain, forming a circle, each girl 
sucking, licking, and probing each other&#39;s clit and vagina, starting 
with Daria, Jane, Tiffany, Stacy, Quinn, Sandi and back to Daria. The 
feelings from that were intense indeed. 

Can it really be so serious?
to be all broken up and delirious
I guess we&#39;ve really been out of touch
but can it really be so serious?
(Serious, so serious)

From there, Sandi laid down and Daria and Quinn sucked her breasts and 
nipples while orally cleaned out by Jane and Stacy respectively; 
Tiffany, for her part, did her oral loving on the brunette, who enjoyed 
the combined sensations a lot. Then for the next few hours each girl 
took turns getting such sexual enjoyment, while others did the loving. 

Day after day
I know it&#39;s not the way that you wanted it
Day after day
I try to find the key, but it don&#39;t fit
but you know how it is
No matter what I did
we gotta talk it over.

Next, each girl took turns swapping lovers--Jane with Quinn, Daria with 
Stacy and Tiffany with Sandi.Each girl had a chance to love each girl, 
however, as one may guess only Sandi, Stacy Jane and Tiffany made love 
with Daria, since she and Quinn were sisters--and rightly so. 

Can it really be so serious?
to be all broken up and delirious
I guess we&#39;ve really been out of touch
but can it really be so serious?
(Serious, so serious)

For the big finish, each girl took turns using the scissor kick 
lovemaking method, each girl moaning and writhing and kissing till they 
gushed out vaginal fluids. Right now Daria was with Jane, Quinn with 
Sandi and Stacy with Tiffany, each one locking their legs, grinding 
their wet vagina and clit to absolute peak level passion, their high on 
emotion crest of a wave loving stoked beyond their limits. 

Tonight, tonight
I&#39;m thinking over everything you said to me
Tonight, tonight
I&#39;m sorry, but I just didn&#39;t see
and now it&#39;s up to you
There&#39;s nothing else to do
We&#39;ve gotta talk it over.

Can it really be so serious?
to be all broken up and delirious
I guess we&#39;ve really been out of touch
but can it really be so serious?
(Serious, so serious)

Serious, so serious
Is it so serious?
Serious, so serious........

In the end, when the girls came for the last time, enjoying the rush 
while they did so, Jane&#39;s bed was full of six naked teen girls trading 
sweet kisses and holding each other. 

&quot;You were saying?&quot; said Jane.

&quot;I only hope,&quot; said Daria, &quot;that Tom, Trent, Jesse, Amy and Tachibana 
san take notes.&quot;

Nearby, Sandi said, &quot;Daria.......you were right.......I don&#39;t need you, 
when I got someone that truly loves me.&quot;

&quot;And that someone is me,&quot; agreed Quinn.

&quot;I could&#39;ve told you that,&quot; the cynic said.

&quot;You know, Sandi,&quot; said Quinn, &quot;the fact my sister paired me and you 
together, I think that SHOULD be rewarded, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;Absolutely.&quot; So saying, Sandi came over to the left side of Daria while 
Quinn did the same, on the right side.

From there, the brunette and the redhead kissed the auburn, Sandi 
kissing the left face cheek, and Quinn kissing the right. Needless to 
say, Jane was laughing at that.

&quot;Just another day in the life of Daria Morgendorffer,&quot; said the cynic. 
&quot;part time cynic lezzie and one half of the brain and the beauty.&quot;

OWARI (THE END) 

EPILOGUE &amp; ENDNOTES

And there you have it--the end of The Brain &amp; The Beauty. Sorry it was 
such a long chapter, like chapter 2, but I had to tie all the loose 
ends. Thanks to Quinn, Sandi was able to patch up her broken heart. And 
Daria and Jane were able to join the ranks of Lawndale&#39;s lesbains (ditto 
for Stacy and Tiffany). Let&#39;s hope they get back to Tom and Jesse soon!! 
I chose Daria and Sandi for the pairing, because next to Quinn, Stacy, 
Tiffany and Jane, Sandi and Daria were my favorite characters. One may 
wonder if I had allowed the Sandi/Daria romance to continue unscathed, 
but I doubt it.

Originally, the story title was The First Five Days, but it was Martin 
J. Pollard, of Outpost Daria, who first coined the line, &quot;the brain and 
the beauty&quot;, so that stuck. A much better title, to say the least.

As you can guess, the story takes place before Is It Collage Yet?

The origin for the name of The Red Barchetta Hotel came from a tune 
titled Red Barchetta, by the band Rush, so please forgive me. Ditto for 
the R. R. Tunnel No. 558 sequence; that was in homage of the similar 
scene from the film version of Pink Floyd&#39;s The Wall. Just a spur of the 
moment.

I Kissed A Girl seemed fitting for Sandi and Daria&#39;s first kiss while 
Neil Young&#39;s Sample &amp; Hold illustrated that Sandi needed someone to 
love. Erasure&#39;s Always is a fave of mine, so it seemed fitting to use 
that for the first lovemaking. The Eagles&#39; The Sad Cafe points out that 
the love the girls had &quot;just turned out that way.&quot; A halcyon thing. 
Foreginer&#39;s I Don&#39;t Want To Live Without You. expresses the imminment 
breakup at hand, while The Electric Light Orchestra&#39;s So Serious sums up 
the rollicking love session twixt all six girls. 

Peace out.
