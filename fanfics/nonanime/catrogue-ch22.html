<h1>The Adventures of Shadowcat and Rogue! (part 22 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>        &quot;Deathstrike,&quot; the voice said quietly.

        Yuriko turned to look at the blonde maid, only to see her form 
shift and blur, becoming a dark skinned, red-haired figure that she 
instantly recognized. &quot;Mystique,&quot; she nodded regally, bracing herself 
subtlety for any possible attack.

        Raven Darkholme nodded slightly, &quot;I come in peace.&quot;

        Yuriko looked a bit skeptical, but seemed willing to wait and 
see. &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; she asked the mutant curiously.

        &quot;Stryfe has returned,&quot; Raven said simply.

        &quot;What?&quot; Yuriko growled, her surprise causing her finger blades 
to extend involuntarily.

        &quot;Just thought you should know,&quot; Raven turned to leave.

        &quot;And his agenda this time?&quot; Yuriko asked coldly.

        &quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; Raven said simply, &quot;we&#39;ve only tangled with 
his agents so far.&quot;

        &quot;When you do know,&quot; and Yuriko&#39;s voice came out in a deadly 
purr, &quot;contact me. I have a score to settle with the one who attempted 
to violate me.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll contact you,&quot; Raven nodded firmly before slipping out 
of the room in the maid&#39;s form once again. She made her way down the 
Sydney hotel&#39;s hallway before finding a private room that was empty. 
She unlocked the door and stepped inside, with a tap of her fingers 
activating her com- badge. &quot;Did you get all of that?&quot; she asked.

        Ororo&#39;s voice came through loud and clear, &quot;It seems that 
Deathstrike still bears a grudge against Stryfe. I just hope we don&#39;t 
need to use her against him.&quot;

        &quot;So do I,&quot; Raven admitted. She had been the one to suggest 
approaching Yuriko, but from what she had read, she didn&#39;t actually 
trust her much. Still, if Stryfe did try to pull something big, they 
might need all the allies they could get.

        &quot;Jean will be contacting me soon,&quot; Ororo added, &quot;so collect 
Heather and Sage and get them back here. I don&#39;t want to risk any of 
us being attacked solo.&quot;

        Raven felt a sudden surge of jealousy at the very idea of 
Ororo talking with Jean, a woman she felt certain had been Ororo&#39;s 
lover once. But she quelled that response, answering evenly, &quot;Then 
I&#39;ll see you soon, love.&quot;

        &quot;See you,&quot; Ororo cut the connection as she felt the slight 
tickle at the back of her head that signaled an telepathic contact. 
She saw a bit of haze first, a slight shimmering, then the image of a 
redheaded telepath appeared in front of her.

        &quot;Ororo,&quot; Jean smiled slightly, &quot;it&#39;s good to hear from you 
again. How&#39;s Raven?&quot;

        Ororo found herself blushing slightly. She had finally 
admitted to Jean that yes, she and Raven were lovers, so she certainly 
expected to get some teasing. &quot;She&#39;s fine,&quot; she answered with as much 
dignity as possible.

        Jean smirked, &quot;Just fine?&quot;

        &quot;Any luck with the search?&quot; Ororo tried to change the subject.

        &quot;No joy,&quot; Jean shook her head with a sigh. &quot;Both I, the 
Professor, and Emma have been scanning, but we&#39;ve come up with 
nothing. They must be operating from a facility equipped with powerful 
telepathic screens,&quot; she explained.

        Ororo frowned, &quot;You allowed Emma Frost to assist with the 
search?&quot;

        Jean smiled back at her wryly, &quot;I know that there&#39;s no love 
lost between you, but she&#39;s a X-man now. You need to put it behind 
you.&quot;

        &quot;She is no X-man, not in my eyes,&quot; Ororo shook her head 
firmly, thinking of the abuse that she had suffered at Emma Frost&#39;s 
hands. It would take far more than simply donning an X-man&#39;s uniform 
for Ororo to extend any trust to her.

        Jean decided to abandon that argument for now, knowing that it 
was pointless to continue. Quietly, &quot;We&#39;ll continue to do random 
searches, in the hopes of catching a flaw in their shields, but 
there&#39;s no guarantees.&quot;

        Ororo nodded gravely. Trying to lighten the mood a bit she 
smiled, &quot;There&#39;s been some progress on the romantic front.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, really?&quot; Jean smiled.

        &quot;Sage has become involved with a lifeguard here,&quot; Ororo said.

        &quot;So who is he?&quot; Jean asked eagerly.

        &quot;She, actually,&quot; Ororo smirked, &quot;Heather Cameron.&quot;

        Heather sighed softly in relief as Raven&#39;s disguise form came 
down the stairs. &quot;About time,&quot; she took a step forward only to be 
stopped by Sage&#39;s gentle hand on her arm.

        &quot;I think that&#39;s the actual employee that she copied,&quot; Sage 
explained as the pretty blonde maid fell into talking with other 
members of the hotel staff.

        &quot;Then where is she?&quot; Heather asked her black haired girlfriend 
plaintively.

        &quot;Right behind you,&quot; the amused voice said from behind them. 
They turned to see Raven in her usual dark haired human form shaking 
her head with a smile, &quot;You two really aren&#39;t very suited to this sort 
of covert work, are you?&quot;

        &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Heather agreed, &quot;I&#39;ll quite happily leave that sort 
of stuff to you and Sage, thanks. Not my style at all.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d much rather have you saving me anyway,&quot; Sage smiled up at 
the blonde lifeguard, taking her by the arm possessively.

        &quot;And you&#39;ve very good at it,&quot; Raven agreed, remembering 
assisting Heather on a lifesaving adventure a few weeks ago. The three 
women left the hotel together, climbing into the jeep outside manned 
by Kitty and Rogue.

        &quot;How did it go?&quot; Kitty eagerly asked as Rogue started up the 
jeep and then pulled them into the heavy morning traffic.

        &quot;She&#39;ll be there to help if we need her,&quot; Raven smiled.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Sage murmured, &quot;I thought that she might still bear a 
grudge over Stryfe&#39;s trying to use her advanced cybernetic systems to 
reactivate the Prime Sentinels.&quot;

        &quot;And you didn&#39;t have any trouble?&quot; Rogue asked.

        There was an odd tone in her voice as she said that, a tone 
Kitty instantly recognized. Rogue had been worried about her mom, even 
though she wasn&#39;t going to show it. Kitty gently rested her hand on 
Rogue&#39;s arm, giving her a comforting smile.

        &quot;No problems,&quot; Raven quickly reassured her daughter, also 
knowing her daughter pretty well. &quot;She extended her claws once, but 
more out of surprise than anything else,&quot; she added.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Rogue nodded firmly, &quot;because if she had actually 
tried to hurt you, I&#39;d...&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;d,&quot; Kitty corrected, tossing Raven a grin before adding, 
&quot;I gotta watch out for my mother-in-law, after all.&quot;

        Raven smiled back, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She looked thoughtful, &quot;If I&#39;m 
your mother-in-law, and I&#39;m involved with Ororo, does that make her 
your mother- in-law, too?&quot;

        Kitty had a distinctly odd look on her face, &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought 
of that.&quot;

        Heather chuckled softly at the expressions on both Kitty and 
Rogue&#39;s faces, and even Sage had to smile slightly.

        &quot;Somehow, I&#39;m not too surprised,&quot; Jean remarked.

        &quot;Why is that?&quot; Ororo raised her eyebrow.

        &quot;I always thought that Sage had a bit of a crush on you, 
actually,&quot; Jean pointed out to her with a little smile.

        Ororo blushed, unsure if Jean was teasing her or not. 
&quot;Elizabeth and Neal are still firmly together,&quot; she said, &quot;and Kitty 
has been working with Elizabeth to develop her fighting skills.&quot;

        &quot;Kitty&#39;s?&quot; Jean blinked.

        Ororo chuckled, &quot;No, Elizabeth&#39;s.&quot;

        &quot;They&#39;re WHAT?!&quot; Elizabeth Braddock burst out in honest 
surprise. Her tone of voice had her boyfriend Neal sitting up in 
alarm, and she gave him a reassuring smile. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said more 
quietly into the phone, &quot;you just startled me. Thanks for the intel.&quot;

        Once she put down the phone Neal asked, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

        &quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Elizabeth smiled. She got up from beside 
the phone and went over to sit down beside Neal on the livingroom 
couch, &quot;Just some old business that I had thought was dead and buried 
a long time ago.&quot;

        &quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot; Neal offered gently.

        &quot;It seems that there&#39;s a new Captain Britain in England,&quot; 
Elizabeth said quietly, &quot;and she&#39;s using the uniform that I once 
wore.&quot;

        Neal looked surprised, &quot;You were Captain Britain?&quot;

        &quot;For a little while,&quot; Elizabeth smiled wryly. &quot;At the time, I 
thought that it would be best if Captain Britain worked directly for 
the government. Brian disagreed, and I tried to guilt-trip him into 
doing it by wearing a spare uniform and calling myself Captain 
Britain.&quot;

        Neal&#39;s eyes widened, remembering something he had read in her 
file, &quot;That&#39;s how you were blinded for awhile, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

        With a grim smile Elizabeth said, &quot;I was called out by 
Slaymaster, a old enemy of mine and Brian&#39;s. He beat me easily, then 
in a final gesture of contempt blinded me.&quot; Softly, &quot;Brian killed him 
for what he did, a few moments later.&quot;

        &quot;If that happened to me,&quot; Neal shook his head, &quot;I don&#39;t know 
what I would have done.&quot; Quite admiringly he added, &quot;I certainly 
couldn&#39;t see myself putting a costume on again.&quot;

        &quot;I got lucky&quot; Elizabeth smiled, sounding pleased by his words, 
&quot;Anyway, it seems that uniform fell into the hands of Black Air, and 
is now being worn by an agent of the Weird Happenings Organization.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Neal blinked.

        &quot;No, WHO,&quot; Elizabeth smirked.

        Neal groaned softly.

        &quot;And how&#39;s Bishop?&quot; Jean asked cautiously. She knew the man 
had once harbored feelings for Ororo, and was hoping that they weren&#39;t 
causing any trouble.

        Ororo laughed softly, &quot;There&#39;s a policewoman pursuing him, 
actually. Sadly, he&#39;s remained oblivious so far.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s our Bishop,&quot; Jean chuckled.

        Lucas Bishop approached his partner&#39;s desk warily, knowing the 
she had been getting a bit waspy lately. Though why rather escaped 
him. Looking down at the normally perky blonde he asked, &quot;Any luck 
with the search?&quot;

        &quot;Lots,&quot; Cat shook her head ruefully, waving a thick sheaf of 
papers around, &quot;I&#39;ve gotten hits from all over the world.&quot;

        Bishop took the papers from her with a smile, &quot;Thanks.&quot; As he 
rifled through them he commented, &quot;I really owe you one for this.&quot;

        &quot;You could,&quot; Cat said with a dangerous little smile, &quot;take me 
out to dinner tonight in thanks.&quot;

        Bishop blinked in surprise, about to open up his mouth to 
explain that he just couldn&#39;t, when he say the disappointed look on 
her face. &#39;It&#39;s only dinner,&#39; he thought to himself before saying 
aloud, &quot;All right, dinner it is.&quot;

        The grin that lit up Cat&#39;s face made it all worth it, somehow. 
&quot;Great,&quot; she laughed, &quot;we&#39;ll head out after work then.&quot;

        &quot;Shouldn&#39;t I go home and change?&quot; Bishop asked.

        Cat chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m not giving you a chance to change your 
mind.&quot;

        Jean&#39;s mental image began to fade out as she said, &quot;We&#39;ll do 
all that we can to find Stryfe. That, I promise you.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Ororo got out before she completely disappeared.
