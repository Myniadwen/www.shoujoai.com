<a href="../nonanime/itsumo-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The Willow Files: One

The bus hit another bump and Willow grimaced, her brown hair falling 
into her eyes. The young woman dressed in jeans and a older blouse, a 
battered jacket thrown over it, looked oddly out of place sitting at the 
window seat, her home and the people she had known swiftly receding 
behind her. She wished she wasn&#39;t going, in many ways, but she also 
knew, somehow, that she had to.

&#39;And,&#39; Willow thought to herself mournfully, &#39;it&#39;s easier than staying 
behind and dealing with the mess I helped make.&#39;

Breaking up with Kennedy had been one of the hardest things that Willow 
had ever done, but she couldn&#39;t bring herself to use the girl that way 
any more. Despite all of the time that had passed Willow wasn&#39;t over her 
dead lover Tara, not really, and she couldn&#39;t be with Kennedy when her 
heart still belonged to someone else.

&#39;Not to mention my crying out Tara&#39;s name during a moment of passion,&#39; 
Willow felt herself blushing with embarrassment.

Even then Kennedy had been willing to stay with Willow, apparently 
convinced it was merely a slip of the tongue, but Willow knew better. As 
gently as possible Willow broke up with her, filling the Summers 
household with arguments and crying for days, then finally falling to 
sulky silence. Giles had suspected she was just running away when she 
revealed her plans to him, and in a way she wondered if he was right.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure this is the best time to go,&quot; Giles said to her gently as 
the two of them had stood out on the porch. He looked tired, the English 
Watcher who had helped guide them all in one way or another, and older. 
Obviously Buffy&#39;s death and all that had come after it were weighing on 
him, and she felt guilty adding to it.

&quot;I don&#39;t know if it would ever be the time to go,&quot; Willow answered 
honestly, putting her hand on the sun warmed wooden railing, &quot;there 
would almost always be something going on to keep me here another few 
days or weeks.&quot; She sighed, &quot;But I have powers, maybe more than I 
realize, and I think with that comes a responsibility to use them to 
help.&quot;

&quot;You could always help here,&quot; Giles said quietly.

&quot;There&#39;s you, Xander, Faith and all of the young Slayers here,&quot; Willow 
said to him evenly, &quot;I&#39;m not really needed here, and you know it.&quot; She 
smiled at him as she added gently, &quot;And you know I&#39;m not going to be 
gone for good.&quot;

&quot;How will you support yourself?&quot; Giles finally asked her, more than a 
hint of concern for the young lady in his voice.

&quot;I&#39;ve saved quite a bit,&quot; Willow said honestly, &quot;along with my college 
money. My parents aren&#39;t happy with how I&#39;m choosing to spend it, 
but...&quot;

Giles made a face, well aware of the non-relationship that she had with 
her parents. &quot;The Council still retains a great deal of resources,&quot; he 
said with a slight smile, &quot;I believe I can suggest they help fund 
someone of your unique skills.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Willow looked up at him in surprise.

&quot;I want to,&quot; he said firmly, Giles smiled a bit sadly, &quot;It&#39;s the least I 
can do for someone who meant so much to Buffy.&quot;

&quot;Then thank you,&quot;, Willow said as she stepped forward to hug Giles 
gently, the sting of tears in the corner of her eyes.

A bump rattled Willow, making her reach out to grab the seat ahead of 
her. With a soft sigh she sat back, looking out into the darkness. Faith 
hadn&#39;t really been bothered one way or another, the dark haired Slayer 
looking on with a certain amusement as the drama played out. Willow 
still had mixed feelings about her, she still remembered Faith&#39;s 
employment with the Mayor of Sunnydale, but she knew Giles and the 
others could keep an eye on her.

Willow rubbed at her eyes tiredly, thinking of a more painful parting. 
Poor Dawnie had been so upset with her, the younger girl both crying and 
angry when she got the news, and she had refused to talk to her when 
Willow left. That rejection had hurt, even though she knew that the girl 
would get over it, eventually.

&#39;At least Xander was cheerful,&#39; Willow thought. Alexander Harris had 
been her friend for almost as long as she could remember, and he had 
realized she was leaving long before anyone else. Even as she had been 
crafting a enchanted eye to replace the natural one he lost they had 
talked about it, helping her figure out what she wanted to do and why.

&quot;So you&#39;re going to become Zatanna?&quot; Xander asked, his eyepatch giving 
him a pirate look.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Willow blinked.

&quot;Scarlet Witch? Enchantress?&quot; Xander offered, then shook his head, &quot;You 
really need to start reading comics again, or you&#39;ll miss the pop 
culture references.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d better not be having a comic book life,&quot; Willow said feelingly, 
&quot;I&#39;d look terrible in one of those skin tight outfits.&quot;

Xander laughed softly, leaning forward in his seat as he studied Willow, 
hair falling forward a bit. He looked better, still grieving for Anya&#39;s 
loss but recovering, slowly but surely. &quot;So what will you be doing?&quot; he 
asked curiously.

&quot;Hit the road,&quot; Willow said honestly. She smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;ve noticed 
that after my training with the British coven I can sense evil forces, 
somewhat. Once I know I&#39;m going in the right direction I can find them, 
and hopefully stop them.&quot;

&quot;Without backup?&quot; Xander raised an eyebrow.

&quot;I&#39;ll manage,&quot; Willow answered, &quot;and there&#39;s always back up around, 
really.&quot; She smiled slightly, &quot;All those awakened Slayers, for one.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Xander nodded. He smiled wryly, &quot;I almost wish I could join 
you, but I&#39;ve got the job and such.&quot;

Willow smiled wryly, putting the sphere she was holding down on the 
table before stretching tiredly. &quot;Did you ever think of all the Scoobies 
you&#39;d end up being the first one to find a life out in the real world?&quot; 
she asked.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Xander admitted. They sat there in the silence for a 
moment, &quot;So have you told your parents about all this?&quot;

&quot;You know them,&quot; Willow sighed, &quot;A phone conversation, lots of agreeable 
sounds and the general sense that they still think I&#39;m just going 
through a phase.&quot;

&quot;And how many years have you been going through this phase?&quot; Xander 
asked impishly.

Willow sighed, &quot;They&#39;ll see the light eventually.&quot;

Back on the bus Willow tried to get a crick out of her neck without 
disturbing the man snoring in the seat next to her. &#39;Remind me to try 
out a airplane next time,&#39; she thought, &#39;it has got to be better than 
this.&#39; Buying a bus ticket seemed like a good idea at the time, as well 
as oddly fitting, considering Buffy had done much the same, years back.

The bus swung into a turn then coasted to a stop as the driver 
announced, &quot;Los Angeles bus depot, everyone out.&quot;

A few minutes later and Willow was sitting on a nearby bench, her two 
bags sitting by her feet as the sun began to rise of the city. The air 
was relatively clear, a breeze pushing the smog away, and there were 
already horns honking and people moving off in the distance.

&quot;Hey toots, new in town?&quot; the warm male voice said from nearby.

Willow frowned, looking over then brightened suddenly as she recognized 
him, &quot;Lorne!&quot; The green skinned demon smiled back, a bit surprised but 
pleased when she stepped up to hug him.

&quot;Well that&#39;s quite the hello.&quot; Lorne laughed. He gestured to a 
convertible parked nearby, &quot;Let me take you to our new digs.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ve really taken over Wolfram and Hart?&quot; Willow asked as they 
drove, the sun shining down on them. Oddly Lorne didn&#39;t seem to draw 
many glances, it appeared the people of LA were used to seeing things 
like him.

&quot;More like they gave it us much like Eve gave Adam the apple,&quot; Lorne 
remarked as they scooted through traffic, &quot;but we&#39;re refusing temptation 
so far.&quot;

&quot;Sounds fun,&quot; Willow smiled wryly. It wasn&#39;t long before they reached 
the law offices, a massive building that Lorne cheerfully led her into, 
up an elevator and over to the chairman&#39;s office. She took in the blonde 
vampire sitting at the reception desk in surprise, &quot;Harmony?&quot;

She beamed, bouncing up off her chair to hug Willow just a second too 
long to be comfortable. &quot;I bet you&#39;re here to see Angel,&quot; Harmony 
smiled, &quot;I&#39;ll see if he&#39;s free.&quot; A short conversation on the phone and 
she waved Willow in, &quot;Go on! I&#39;ll catch up with you later.&quot;

The office clearly had started out as that of a traditional executive, 
but Angel had already put his stamp on it, weapons hanging on the wall 
and a Spartan elegance to the place. Angel himself stood up as soon as 
she entered, his eyes sorrowful as he welcomed her. &quot;It&#39;s good to see 
you,&quot; he said.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Willow was honest as she said, &quot;I wish there had been 
something more I could do for Buffy.&quot;

Angel closed his eyes a moment, then opened them to meet her gaze 
without accusation. &quot;I heard about what you did, awakening the Slayers,&quot; 
he said, &quot;you more than had your hands full.&quot;

Quietly Willow sketched in what had happened then, as well as giving a 
rough summary of what she was planning. &quot;I&#39;m just passing through,&quot; she 
said, &quot;but I wanted to see you in person.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Angel said gravely. He paused, then dug through folders on 
top of his desk, &quot;I was wondering... we have a situation, a magician 
that seems to be knocking off his business rivals. Care to give us a 
hand?&quot;

&#39;Guess this is going to happen to me a lot,&#39; Willow thought even as she 
grabbed her tool kit, filled with implements and ingredients for doing 
magic. &quot;What can I do to help?&quot;

End, File One

Author&#39;s Notes: Don&#39;t expect &#39;Willow Files&#39; very regularly, or that many 
of them. I want to sketch in Willow&#39;s time on the road as well as put 
her up against some different sort of things than she might have faced 
in Buffy. Requests for favorite characters will be taken, but no 
promises on if they&#39;ll appear or in what form. Also, I started writing 
Itsumo before the apocalyptic final Angel season, so I&#39;m mostly going to 
be ignoring the darker stuff from that time.
