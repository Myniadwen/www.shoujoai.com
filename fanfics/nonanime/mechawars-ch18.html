<h1>Mecha Wars (part 18 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/mechawars-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>        &quot;You&#39;re sure this is going to work?&quot; Linna asked as she stood 
at the very edge of the building. Mega-Tokyo traffic was streaming by 
below as the other Knight Sabers stood just behind her, Iron Man 
waiting by their side. The sun had set hours ago and the near darkness 
was the perfect cover for what they were about to attempt.

        &quot;If anything does go wrong,&quot; Tony&#39;s calmly reassuring voice 
came over Linna&#39;s helmet communicator, &quot;I&#39;ll be ready to catch you.&quot;

        &quot;Gee, thanks a lot,&quot; Linna answered dryly as she drew on her 
courage and boldly stepped right off the edge of the roof.

        Newly installed systems swiftly came to life, powerful 
thrusters placed on the boots as well as mounted on the hardsuit&#39;s 
back flared to life, and Linna found herself hovering there in midair. 
Unlike the old suits that could only boost their powerful leaps and 
help guide and slow a fall downward, this suit was actually flying.

        &quot;I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; Priss said admringly, &quot;it actually works.&quot;

        &quot;The theory was sound,&quot; Sylia pointed out with a smile.

        &quot;You mean you didn&#39;t test it first?&quot; Nene squeaked out.

        &quot;We ran a series of very demanding computer simulations,&quot; Tony 
said to them with her grin evident in her voice.

        &#39;Forward,&#39; Linna thought, and the cybernetic interface threw 
the suit forward, right towards a skyscrapper. &#39;Much too fast,&#39; she 
realized, twisting herself around to get her feet pointed in front of 
her body. &#39;Max thrust,&#39; she thought wildly, and blasted away back 
towards the others. She came down on the roof hard, staggering a few 
steps until Priss caught her.

        &quot;How was it?&quot; Sylia asked.

        &quot;It was great,&quot; Linna laughed wildly as the adrenalyn high 
slowly began to subside. &quot;It&#39;s going to take some practice with it, 
but once we all get used to flying the boomers won&#39;t know what hit 
them,&quot; she eagerly said.

        &quot;Just watch the fuel consumption,&quot; Tony warned them, &quot;even 
with my suit, long range flight can burn my fuel levels to dangerous 
lows. Don&#39;t fly unless you really need to.&quot;

        &quot;Got it,&quot; Priss said as she took a running start and with a 
leap soared off the side. Nene was a bit more tentative in her 
stepping off, but she was soon maneuvering out in the air gracefuly, 
leaving only Sylia and Tony standing there.

        &quot;Together?&quot; Tony asked as she offered Sylia a gauntleted hand.

        &quot;Together,&quot; Sylia agreed as they both launched themselves into 
the sky.

        Within a small office in the center levels in the massive 
Genom tower a group of computer technitians was burning the midnight 
oil once again. &quot;All right,&quot; one of them muttered softly, &quot;we&#39;ve 
traced the money off shore, where it appeared from there into shell 
companies and then into banks to buy up the available Genom stock.&quot;

        &quot;We can&#39;t trace the money back,&quot; another tech moaned softly, 
&quot;it was channeled through numbered Swiss accounts.&quot;

        &quot;And the shell companies are all dead ends too,&quot; a woman 
added, &quot;they are all post office boxes, rented through various 
intermediaries electronically.&quot;

        &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; the first tech sat up, an odd look on his 
face, &quot;maybe we&#39;re grabbing at the wrong end of the stick here.&quot;

        &quot;What do you mean?&quot; the woman leaned forward eagerly.

        &quot;Who owns the internet systems that connected all the parties 
we think were involved in this?&quot; he asked the other two eagerly.

        &quot;Cyberdata,&quot; the other young man said. His eyes widened 
slightly, &quot;Which is a fully owned and operated subsiderary of Genom.&quot;

        &quot;I bet if we can get access to their confidential system 
management files,&quot; the first tech had a dangerous gleam in his eyes as 
he ran his hand roughly through short brown hair, &quot;we can track all 
the signals right back to home.&quot;

        &quot;Completely illegal,&quot; the woman noted with a slight smile, 
&quot;but I doubt Madigan cares. Let&#39;s do it, and I won&#39;t tell if you 
won&#39;t.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s get to work,&quot; the third figure agreed.

        The sun was rising when they finally fell back into their 
seats, exhausted. &quot;We&#39;ve got it,&quot; the woman said softly.

        &quot;Looks like it,&quot; the brown haired man yawned, &quot;now we just 
have to wrap it all up into a bow for Ms. Madigan.&quot;

        &quot;Either of you hear of this lady before?&quot; the other man waved 
the data disk around.

        &quot;Sylia Stingray,&quot; the woman shook her head slightly, &quot;it rings 
a bell, but not much else.&quot;

        The email was prepared with the data they had accessed, then 
sent to Madigan&#39;s desk. It was marked urgent, of course, but that 
didn&#39;t mean much with the amount of paperwork that a company the size 
of Genom produced. It could be a day or so until they all heard back 
from their boss. Tired to the bone they stumbled out of their office 
and headed home, to catch some sleep before they were called back into 
work once again.

        A car pulled up and the brown haired woman straightened up 
from where she was waiting, taking a moment to make sure she was neat. 
&quot;Linna,&quot; Reika smiled and walked over to give Linna a friendly hug 
that lasted just a bit longer than necessary.

        &quot;Reika,&quot; Linna smiled, just for a moment savoring the feeling 
of the woman&#39;s arms around her. Pulling away a bit reluctantly she 
said, &quot;Shall we go in?&quot;

        The two casually dressed young women walked into the Angelic 
Layer stadium, and were soon surrounded by people of all ages carrying 
Angels of one type or another. &quot;Incredible.&quot; Reika looked over the mob 
thoughtfully, &quot;I knew that the Layer had become very popular, but I 
didn&#39;t realize it was quite up to this level again.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s really hit it big,&quot; Linna agreed, &quot;many of the top 
players or Deus are treated almost like rockstars, especially the top 
four.&quot;

        &quot;And they are?&quot; Reika asked as they made their way to a 
reception desk, mildly surprised at Linna&#39;s knowledge on the subject.

        &quot;Misaki Suzuhara, Hatoko Kobayashi, Sai Jounouchi and Kaede 
Saitou,&quot; Linna said, &quot;if you like, I can introduce you later.&quot;

        &quot;So we&#39;re here to cheer your friends on?&quot; Reika asked.

        Linna chuckled, &quot;Not quite.&quot; She produced her member card, 
then quite gently drew her angel Priss from inside her jacket. &quot;I&#39;m 
here to compete,&quot; she smiled.

        Reika smiled back, &quot;You&#39;re just full of surprises.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Linna said, &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind. I promised I 
would play a while back, and I hate going back on my word.&quot;

        &quot;Actually, I&#39;m curious to see you in action,&quot; Reika smiled. 
She looked thoughtful, &quot;So you&#39;re a stockbroker, you play Angelic 
Layer, and you have your... other job.&quot;

        &quot;Pretty much,&quot; Linna agreed.

        &quot;Have you been.. dating much?&quot; Reika asked her softly.

        &quot;No,&quot; Linna answered her as she led Reika down through the 
levels of seating towards the front rows, &quot;I&#39;ve never dated as much as 
I&#39;d like my friends to think I have.&quot; A slightly sad smile, &quot;I guess 
I&#39;ve just never found the right one.&quot;

        Reika squeezed Linna&#39;s hand gently, &quot;Let&#39;s hope that&#39;s 
changed.&quot;

        There were several open seats in the front, and nearby four 
young woman stood talking. &quot;Hey Hotoko,&quot; Linna waved.

        Reika felt a moment of worry when she saw Hotoko&#39;s friendly 
smile to Linna, but quickly realized that the four women were all 
paired up. Hotoko stood with a smaller redhead, while the tall, icy 
blonde stood with a much more pleasant looking lady.

        &quot;Hello Linna,&quot; Hotoko visibly welcomed her into the group, 
&quot;who&#39;s your friend?&quot;

        &quot;Reika,&quot; Lina introduced her, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Misaki, 
Sai, Kaede and Hotoko. They&#39;re the four top Deus I mentioned earlier.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s good to meet you,&quot; Reika shook hands all around.

        &quot;Girlfriend?&quot; Hotoko asked Linna very softly while Misaki and 
Kaede kept Reika occupied.

        &quot;Not exactly,&quot; Linna blushed.

        Sai raised her eyebrow, &quot;Not exactly?&quot;

        &quot;She wants to be,&quot; Linna explained, &quot;and I&#39;m a bit nervous 
about the idea.&quot;

        Sai rolled her eyes, &quot;She&#39;s a babe, Linna. Go for it.&quot;

        &quot;You sound just like Priss,&quot; Linna grumbled.


        Priss Asagiri groaned as the knocking on her door roused her 
from a sound sleep. Not only had they run all those suit tests last 
night, but Priss had also preformed with her band the Replicants later 
that evening, too. She was wiped, and she didn&#39;t want to deal with 
anything else.

        &quot;Go &#39;way!&quot; Priss managed to yell, but it didn&#39;t stop the 
knocker.

        Swearing under her breath Priss levered herself up out of her 
bed. She took a step forward, then stopped, looking down at the 
oversized T- shirt and panties that she was wearing. &#39;It&#39;s probably 
just Sylia bugging me,&#39; she scowled and started forward again.

        &quot;What?!&quot; Priss flung the door open. Taking one look at the 
women who were standing there Priss went red and ducked behind the 
door, &quot;Aunt Natsumi?!&quot;

        &quot;Nice to see my niece has grown up into a healthy young 
woman,&quot; Natsumi smirked. Behind Miyuki had gone beet red, peeking out 
from between her fingers. &quot;This almost makes up for you walking in on 
us necking,&quot; she laughed.

        &quot;Natsumi,&quot; the still fiercely blushing Miyuki scolded her 
lover.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Priss kept herself concealed behind the door, &quot;I 
wasn&#39;t expecting you.&quot;

        &quot;So you were going to meet someone else at the door in that 
outfit?&quot; Natsumi asked archly.

        &quot;Just give up,&quot; Miyuki smiled at Priss, &quot;you can&#39;t win.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m gonna go get dressed,&quot; Priss sighed, &quot;wait here a moment, 
will ya?&quot; She shut the door, looking around at the disaster her 
trailer was. &#39;No way in hell I can tidy this up,&#39; she thought as she 
quickly pulled on some pants, frsh shiry, socks and shoes.

        &quot;Not bad,&quot; Natsuki grinned once the fully dressed Priss came 
to the door.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Priss said dryly. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

        Miyuki took a peek past Priss to see the disaster area inside 
and remarked to Natsumi, &quot;Looks just like your bachelor place did 
before you moved in with me.&quot;

        &quot;I wasn&#39;t that bad,&quot; Natsumi protested. She looked over at 
Priss, &quot;I thought we&#39;d take you out to lunch, and you can give us an 
idea what to expect tomorrow night.&quot;

        &quot;You don&#39;t need to be afraid of Sylia and the others,&quot; Priss 
laughed, &quot;Sylia wouldn&#39;t hurt a fly.&quot; She paused, &quot;Well, only if the 
fly really deserved it.&quot;


        Madigan didn&#39;t make it back in to her office until night was 
falling over the city, sitting down tiredly behind her desk to review 
all her email. She gave a quick once over to the various files and 
opened one that was labeled &#39;urgent&#39; quite casually. But reading what 
it contained jerked her right out of her complacency very quickly.

        &quot;Sylia Stingray,&quot; Madigan murmured, &quot;where have I seen that 
name before?&quot; Her eyes narrowed slightly, and she called up a list of 
the various shareholders. Her face went pale as she reviewed the 
totals, her mouth a tense line.

        Downloading all the relevant files Madigan all but ran out of 
her small office, hurrying to the elevators and up to the chairman&#39;s 
office. She barged right by the shocked secretary and inside, visibly 
startling the older man.

        &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; Quincy demanded.

        &quot;We have a serious problem,&quot; Madigan replied quietly.

        Quincy quickly assessed the situation and sent his secretary 
back outside. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; he asked her softly.

        &quot;The small companies that were buying up your stock are all 
owned by one person,&quot; Madigan revealed, &quot;Sylia Stingray.&quot; She put the 
disk into a terminal to call up the relevant files, &quot;Using shell 
companies she&#39;s bought up over 40% of the company&#39;s stock.&quot;

        &quot;Not enough to threaten my hold on the company,&quot; Quincy 
sounded relieved.

        &quot;You don&#39;t understand,&quot; Madigan said with a certain amount of 
force, &quot;she already had 10% before all this started. You counted it 
with your supporters because she hadn&#39;t actually voted against you 
before now.&quot;

        Quincy went pale. &quot;She has over 50% of the stock?&quot; he 
murmured.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Madigan practically hissed, &quot;and the shareholder&#39;s 
meeting is only days away.&quot;

        &quot;Then we must make sure she doesn&#39;t make it to the meeting,&quot; 
Quincy said grimly. &quot;How many boomers can we divert before tomorrow 
night?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Madigan said softly, &quot;a substantial number, 
certainly.&quot; She looked at him thoughtfully, &quot;You are planning to...&quot;

        &quot;Boomers rampage across the city fairly regularly,&quot; Quincy 
said softly, &quot;tomorrow they&#39;re simply going to do it at Ms. Stingray&#39;s 
home.&quot;</pre>
