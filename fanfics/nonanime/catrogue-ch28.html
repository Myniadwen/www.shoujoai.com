<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>        Plasma and Lorna exchanged a silent glance, quickly weighing 
what Feral had just told them. Plasma nodded to her partner 
slightly, and Polaris struck!

        &quot;What are you,&quot; Feral yowled, as bands of metal bound her 
fast, yanking arms back and securing her legs.

        &quot;X-men!&quot; Plasma yelled, &quot;We want to talk!&quot;

        &quot;What do you think?&quot; Mystique asked Storm softly.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know this Plasma,&quot; Storm frowned, &quot;but I think I 
trust Polaris.&quot; She paused, &quot;Some, anyway.&quot; With that she waved the 
two young women toward them, their metal clad captive floating 
between them.

        Deathstryke stood to the side, her finger-blades fully 
extended. It was painfully clear that the Asian samurai did not 
trust them, and would do what she must to prevent any betrayal.

        &quot;Stryfe has a psycho named Nemesis in containment,&quot; Polaris 
said crisply, &quot;according to Feral, Sakura intends to release him. 
He&#39;ll kill anything he sees.&quot;

        &quot;He&#39;ll be furious over being held captive,&quot; Sage said to the 
others bleakly, &quot;we have to stop him as soon as possible.&quot;

        &quot;What are they talking about?&quot; Thunderbird asked Psylocke 
softly. His Asian lover drew him aside gently, away from the others 
so they could talk.

        &quot;Nemesis is an energy being, trapped in a suit of 
crystalline body armor,&quot; Psylocke explained softly. &quot;He&#39;s immensely 
powerful, and a firm believer in the survival of the fittest.&quot;

        &quot;All right,&quot; Storm spoke up, &quot;here&#39;s what we&#39;ll do. Plasma, 
Polaris..&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Polaris cut her off.

        Plasma reached out to take Polaris&#39; hand in hers, &quot;We&#39;re 
leaving.&quot;

        Storm met Polaris&#39; eyes, &quot;Are you certain this is what you 
want to do?&quot;

        &quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Polaris said seriously as she squeezed her 
lover&#39;s hand, &quot;I won&#39;t fight you, but I&#39;m not helping you fight 
them, either.&quot; With that, Polaris swiftly lifted both women into the 
air, and they disappeared into the night.

        &quot;Let&#39;s move,&quot; Storm said softly, gazing towards the nearby 
town.

        &quot;What do we do with the kitty-cat?&quot; Shadowcat asked, gazing 
down at the trussed up and softly cursing Feral.

        &quot;Leave her,&quot; Bishop said as the tall black man ran through 
his arsenal.

        &quot;We&#39;ll come back for her later,&quot; Storm agreed as the team 
headed towards the little Outback town. Among the buildings they 
could see fires burning, and they knew what awaited them.

        Feral continued to curse once they were gone, struggling 
weakly against the alloy bonds. &#39;I am so going to make those bitches 
pay for this,&#39; she thought, completely unaware that a figure had 
emerged from the nearby shadows.

        &quot;Hold still,&quot; Sakura ordered the catgirl crisply. A blade 
gleamed silver in her hands, remarkably sharp, and with surprising 
ease she cut Feral free.

        &quot;Why did you..?&quot; Feral rubbed at her arms and legs to get 
some of the circulation back into her tingling limbs.

        &quot;Get up,&quot; Sakura offered her hand, firmly pulling the 
catgirl back to her feet. The white haired ninja lead her 
away, &quot;You&#39;re still useful to me, girl.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Feral said softly. Her eyes narrowed in 
anger, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you kill those two traitors if you were hidden 
back there?&quot;

        Sakura smiled coldly, &quot;If we win, I can attend to them at my 
leisure.&quot;

        &quot;And if we loose,&quot; Feral said softly, &quot;I guess it won&#39;t 
matter anyway.&quot;

        &quot;Exactly,&quot; Sakura agreed.

        Rogue was on point when they hit the town proper, swiftly 
moving through a maze of oddly familiar buildings to try to sneak up 
on Nemesis. It didn&#39;t work, the nearly eight foot tall figure 
hammering her backward through a wall!

        Nemesis was a fearsome figure, a human skeleton, crackling 
with unearthly energies, contained within a nearly eight foot tall 
crystal body armor. Glowing with an ominous golden light he threw 
fire from one hand, striking out with inhuman strength with the 
other.

        &quot;I&#39;m going to try to disrupt his energy flow,&quot; Kitty said, 
sprinting through a wave of energy like a ghost. She dove through 
his body, praying it would work.

        Nemesis screamed out in agony, his voice ringing, a wave of 
power throwing them all backwards. &quot;You hurt me...&quot; he 
growled, &quot;you&#39;ll regret that.&quot;

        Sage hung back, the pale X-Man studying him intently. &#39;He 
seems to have no real weakness in his powers,&#39; she calmly 
noted, &#39;his only limitation seems to be the containment suit.&#39;

        High above the battle field, Storm manipulated the weather 
systems. Positive and negative charges shifted, power surged around 
her hands as she ordered, &quot;Clear!&quot;

        The X-Men moved back a moment, and it was like the skies 
opened up on Nemesis. The lightning bolt exploded the earth, sending 
rock and debris flying, but when the smoke cleared he remained 
unscathed.

        Boom!

        Rogue hit him with an sudden uppercut, driving the off 
balance enemy backwards. But her blows seemed to do no real harm, 
rocking him but otherwise leaving him unmarked. She ducked under a 
blow, kicked out at his crotch and felt a bit of amusement when he 
reflexedly flinched.

        &quot;Don&#39;t get to close,&quot; Mystique yelled, using borrowed guns 
to blast away at Nemesis. The energy bolts seemed to do little harm, 
but they helped keep him off balance.

        A wild stream of power shot from Nemesis, and Lifeguard 
threw her body over her lover&#39;s. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; the golden 
skinned blonde asked.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; thanks,&quot; Sage smiled reaching up to stroke her love&#39;s 
cheek before going back to studying their foe. &#39;The armor has to 
go,&#39; Sage thought to herself bleakly, making her way over to 
Bishop&#39;s side. &quot;Do you have any armor piercing rounds?&quot; she asked

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Bishop pulled the clip out of one of his 
weapons with a slight frown, &quot;but it wouldn&#39;t hit with enough force 
to penetrate all that crystal.&quot;

        &quot;Leave that to me,&quot; Sage smiled before yelling, &quot;Rogue!&quot;

        Psylocke and Thunderbird took that as their cue to move in, 
double teaming Nemesis with a thermal strike combined with 
telekinesis. Again and again they hammered at Nemesis, trying to 
find any weakness in his armor.

        Rogue took a breather, quickly moving over to Sage&#39;s 
side. &quot;What&#39;s the plan?&quot; she asked, knowing the living computer 
probably had one ready.

        Sage tossed the bullet to her and asked, &quot;When I give the 
signal, can you throw this at Nemesis point first?&quot;

        Bishop&#39;s eyes widened slightly. &quot;Of course,&quot; he grinned.

        &quot;No problem,&quot; Rogue tossed the bullet up and down in her 
hand.

        Sage pressed her &#39;X&#39; symbol, &quot;Storm, I need you to be ready 
to use your winds to push large amounts of sand into the town.&quot;

        &quot;I can do it,&quot; Storm agreed, beginning to build the winds 
she would need from the storm system she had already called up.

        Sage tapped the &#39;X&#39; symbol once again, &quot;Thunderbird, I want 
you to be ready to generate as much heat as you possibly can.&quot;

        &quot;Do my best,&quot; Thunderbird replied, the Mediterranean man 
sounding obviously stressed.

        &quot;Now,&quot; Sage commanded Rogue.

        Rogue grinned, holding the bullet carefully as she combined 
her normal strength with the abilities of other beings she had 
absorbed over the years. The bullet flew from her hand, a small 
sonic boom in it&#39;s wake, and punched deeply into the startled 
Nemesis&#39; shell. Cracks spread rapidly, Nemesis trying to hold that 
armor together, then it simply shattered.

        &quot;Storm!&quot; Sage cried.

        Sand flowed in on the winds, striking the blazing energy 
being, melting into a layer of glass. Sage gestured and Thunderbird 
melted more sand, pouring it down onto Nemesis until he was sealed 
in a block of glass, frozen like a statue. The skeleton within 
flared with energy a few times, but finally the light died down to a 
dull glow.

        The control room was deathly quiet as Sakura and Feral gazed 
at the monitor image. &quot;Damn,&quot; Sakura finally said softly. She hadn&#39;t 
really expected the X-men to be able to defeat Nemesis, honestly. 
She thought he was enough to kill them.

        &quot;What do we hit them with next?&quot; Feral asked from her side.

        Sakura was a bit surprised that the girl hadn&#39;t fled 
already, honestly. Feral had to know that things were going against 
them. As the X- Men began to move forward on the monitor screen, 
Sakura hit a few switches. &quot;The boobytraps and defenses in the town 
should slow them down,&quot; she said.

        &quot;What can I do?&quot; Feral offered, a dangerous smile on her 
face.

        For a moment, Sakura considered sending Feral out against 
the X-Men, but swiftly decided against it. It would be a pointless 
gesture. &quot;Come with me,&quot; Sakura turned from the control room, &quot;it&#39;s 
time to go see if McCoy is done.&quot;

        Up above they plowed through the town&#39;s defenses, handling 
the weapons emplacements, explosives, and traps quickly and 
efficiently. Lifeguard seemed to have a real gift for it, telling 
them where the traps were and often changing form to deal with them.

        &quot;This is almost too easy,&quot; Deathstryke scowled as she cut 
another robot down.

        &quot;We haven&#39;t seen Stryfe yet,&quot; Mystique reminded her softly.

        &quot;If we don&#39;t beat him,&quot; Bishop agreed, &quot;none of this will 
mean anything.&quot;

        Suddenly, there was a gentle shaking deep below them. Then 
once again, a slight shifting of the ground. Buildings, already 
battered, began to fall, as if a wave was moving through the earth 
itself.

        &quot;What in the world,&quot; Lifeguard murmured.

        &quot;Is it Avalanche?&quot; Kitty blinked, wondering if there was a 
Brotherhood member that they were yet unaware of.

        A stronger shaking, then the ground vomited in front of 
them. As Storm, Psylocke and Lifeguard used their abilities to try 
to shield the others, a figure rose up from the torn earth. As the 
dust began to settle, there was a flash of silver.

        Sakura emerged first, pristine in her white garb, her mane 
of white hair billowing around her. On one side McCoy stepped 
forward, the mutant geneticist grinning a dangerously mad smile 
through his blue fur. On the other side of Sakura Feral waited, 
ready for any cue her mistress might give. And just above them, he 
floated.

        Stryfe had abandoned his helmet, his prematurely white hair 
blowing around his face, His long red cloak flowed in the 
telekinetic energies, his armor shining. His power was incredible, 
washing over everyone like some evil wave.

        &quot;Time to die,&quot; Stryfe smiled coldly.
