<h1>Dead Ahead</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Sookie Stackhouse was hurrying to serve a customer at
Merlotte&#39;s as the busy blonde waitress heard the door
open, blinking as she realized she couldn&#39;t sense them
with her telepathy. Looking up she saw the blonde
vampire casually walk in, then make a straight course
for one of the tables in her section.

Pam was a friend of her&#39;s, sort of, but Sookie still
felt a nervous twinge on seeing her enter. In her
experience with vampires Sookie had sadly learned that
almost like clockwork she would be hurt, beat up or
nearly killed soon after one contacted her. It was
almost like a law of physics, and to be honest she was
getting very tired of it.

&quot;Problem?&quot; Sam Merlotte asked quietly as Sookie came
up to the bar to pick up drinks for a table of locals.
His redish gold hair fell into worried eyes, eyes that
were nearly level with Sookie&#39;s as they were close to
the same height. He was a shifter, able to change into
another form at the full moon, and shifters generally
didn&#39;t get along well with vampires.

Sookie nodded towards Pam, &quot;Not sure yet, but I&#39;ll
find out.&quot;

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Sam said, his eyes flashing with genuine
concern.

Sookie nodded as she put a bottle of TrueBlood in the
microwave before carrying over the guys&#39; drinks. Like
always there was a low background noise from her
telepathy, only her shields and years of practice
keeping the din out. If there was one thing Sookie
liked about vampires it was that their unique state
made them immune to her curse. Or gift, if you wanted
to look at it that way.

&quot;Hey Sookie,&quot; one guy slurred, &quot;you still seeing that
vampire?&quot;

Sookie just ignored it and hurried back to the bar.
Her former boyfriend whom she refused to think about
still lived in the area, which meant the locals liked
to bring it up occasionally. With a sigh she poured
the TrueBlood out into a glass and put it on her tray,
walking over to where Pam sat watching her
thoughtfully.

&#39;Which is unusual,&#39; Sookie mused. Pam didn&#39;t much care
for humanity, and the last time she was here she went
into a kind of stand by mode waiting for Sookie,
unnerving more than a few customers. &quot;Here you go,&quot;
she dropped off the TrueBlood.

TrueBlood was a synthetic blood developed by the
Japanese a few years ago, one that Vampires had
discovered could replace human blood as a food source.
Because of that the vampires had decided to reveal
themselves, something society was still trying to
fully deal with.

Pam looked up at her thoughtfully as she took the
drink, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Smoothly she tossed it back,
setting the cup down on the little table with a sigh
before she said, &quot;Could I speak with you for a
moment?&quot;

The door opened and Sookie winced as another crowd of
minds entered. &quot;I think it&#39;s going to be a busy
night,&quot; she said apologetically, &quot;could you wait until
closing?&quot;

A faint smile tugged at Pam&#39;s lips, &quot;Of course, I&#39;ll
wait till then.&quot;

&#39;She really is acting strangely,&#39; Sookie mused as she
watched Pam drink, then casually sit back and relax.

The night dragged on as usual, men and women pouring
in, drinking and eating, then heading back out into
the night. Sookie, Tanya and the other staff hurried
to keep the orders flowing and the people happy,
collecting tips and being run off their feet. And all
the while Pam watched thoughtfully, drinking her
TrueBlood and frightening the customers.

As they readied for closing Sam frowned at Sookie as
he quietly said, &quot;This is the third time I&#39;ve seen her
here lately. Is there something going on?&quot;

&quot;Not that I know of,&quot; Sookie shrugged helplessly.
&quot;Eric hasn&#39;t sent for me since I got back from
Dallas...&quot;

&quot;I guess you have to see her,&quot; Sam said after a
moment&#39;s thought, &quot;but watch yourself.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Sam,&quot; Sookie said as she smiled at him
fondly. Heading to the back room she took a moment to
tidy her hair and take off her apron before collecting
her purse from where she usually stashed it in a
drawer in Sam&#39;s desk. After taking a second to tidy
her clothes Sookie headed out into the night.

Pam waited patiently beside the building, her blonde
hair flowing in the faint breeze. She almost reminded
Sookie of a soccer mom dressed in her casual slacks
and sweater. &quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; Pam said, smiling
faintly.

Sookie tilted her head as they walked towards where
her car waited, &quot;So this isn&#39;t vampire business? You
weren&#39;t sent by Eric?&quot;

Eric Northman was Pam&#39;s sire and the head of the
vampires here in Bon Temps, Louisiana, acting as
sheriff for the queen of the vampires in their state
as well as running his bar, Fangtasia. He was tough
and capable, even for a vampire, and Sookie mostly
trusted him, even though there were times she didn&#39;t
even like him very much.

&quot;No,&quot; Pam shook her head firmly ass she explained, &quot;in
fact, I came here to try to satisfy my curiosity about
you.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Sookie blinked as she reached her car.

Pam stepped closer, looking down into Sookie&#39;s eyes as
she asked, &quot;What is it about you? Eric, Bill, Chow,
even the queen all seem drawn to you.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s the fairy blood?&quot; Sookie guessed.

&quot;It can&#39;t just be that,&quot; Pam murmured as she gently
touched Sookie&#39;s cheek, &quot;even I...&quot;

Sookie paled a bit as she stepped back, &quot;Pam, I don&#39;t
swing that way.&quot;

Pam drew back a bit sheepishly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Sookie.
Eric would be most upset if I took what was his.&quot;

A bit breathlessly Sookie answered, &quot;I&#39;m not his.&quot;

Pam smiled down at her, &quot;You know what I mean.&quot;

Sookie leaned against the car, even though her
instincts were telling her to get in the car and drive
away. &quot;You really...?&quot; she trailed off, not sure how
to say it.

Pam actually chuckled as she rested against the car
too. &quot;You remember when you were poisoned by the
maenad Callisto?&quot; Pam reminded her, &quot;I helped drain
the poison by drinking your blood... and it was
deliscous.&quot;

&quot;Uhm,&quot; Sookie blushed, still not sure how to respond
to such a compliment.

Pam smirked, &quot;And I got to see your breasts too, they
were certainly worth it.&quot;

Sookie make a choking sound, &quot;Pam!&quot;

Pam gave Sookie a thoughtful look as she asked,
&quot;You&#39;re really unused to getting compliments, aren&#39;t
you?&quot;

Sookie gave her a shy smile, &quot;No, not really. It&#39;s
only been in the last few months that...&quot;

&quot;Humans are fools,&quot; Pam shook her head in disgust.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sookie said quietly.

Pam reached out to caress Sookie&#39;s cheek as she softly
asked, &quot;Sookie?&quot;

Reluctantly Sookie turned a bit to look in the
vampires&#39; eyes, &quot;Yes?&quot;

Pam bent forward to press her lips to Sookie&#39;s, then
let her go. &quot;If you ever decide to change your mind,&quot;
she took a few steps away from Sookie, &quot;you know where
to find me.&quot;

With that Pam was gone, disappearing using the eerie
speed that a vampire was capable of. Her eyes wide
Sookie brought her fingers up to touch her still
tingling lips, then quickly got her door open and
climbed into her car.

&#39;Just what I need,&#39; Sookie sighed, but she had to
admit... there was a certain thrill in knowing Pam
might be interested in her.

End

Notes: Pam is rather omnisexual in the southern
vampire novels, but she does seem to have more of a
thing for the ladies. Sadly Sookie is as straight as a
board, which is regrettable considering the ladies who
might otherwise be showing a interest in her.
