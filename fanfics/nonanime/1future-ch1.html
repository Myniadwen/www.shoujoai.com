<h1>Once and Future</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Rachel Summers had to smile to herself slightly as she
saw the crowd of students standing in the observation
deck, looking down through the clear floor into the
Danger Room. It was a regular occurrence these days,
the students taking the chance to watch one or more of
the X-Men in action, getting a sense of what to aspire
to.

&quot;So who is it this time?&quot; Rachel called out to them
curiously as she walked on over, her short red hair
falling into her eyes. The simple T-shirt she wore
clung to her snugly while the blue jeans were nearly
painted on to her slim legs.

Noriko looked sheepish as she looked up, the blue
haired younger girl meeting Rachel&#39;s eyes a bit shyly.
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she pushed her hair back with one of her
gauntleted hands as she explained, &quot;we just got kinda
surprised.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Rachel asked before looking down into the Danger
Room then had to fight back a smile at what she saw
there.

Her best friend Kitty Pryde was in the middle of a
combat scenario, the simulated opponents circling her
warily, then without warning Kitty moved. With a
flying kick she dropped her first foe, carrying
through the motion to snap a sudden punch to another&#39;s
face, sending him reeling. In a matter of seconds she
dropped all six of the men, seemingly without breaking
a sweat.

&quot;Damn, I&#39;d like to absorb those skills,&quot; David
admitted, the African-American boy blinking in honest
surprise.

&quot;Not what you expected from your computer teach?&quot;
Rachel asked impishly.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Noriko agreed. She hesitated, smiling
wryly, &quot;And I think most of the guys were pretty
impressed by how she looks in that leotard.&quot;

Rachel had to chuckle softly, silently agreeing with
that assessment. The dark blue leotard that Kitty was
wearing was soaked with sweat from previous battles,
clinging to her body and showing off each and every
graceful curve. With a wave she left the students to
their viewing but warned them, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t hang around
too long, or Emma will put you to work.&quot;

A little while later Kitty smiled sunily as she left
the Danger Room, pleasantly surprised to see Rachel
standing out there waiting for her. They hadn&#39;t
planned to get together till later that day, both of
them having meetings scheduled for their various X-men
teams, but an unexpected cancellation from Scott had
freed then both up.

&quot;So what did you think?&quot; Kitty asked curiously,
toweling off some of the sweat, her soaking top
clinging to the curve of her breasts.

Rachel found her gaze tending down to that sweaty view
then made herself look up to meet Kitty&#39;s amused eyes.
&quot;I think you&#39;ve got a fan club,&quot; she revealed, &quot;a
group of students were pretty impressed by watching
you fight.&quot;

Kitty blushed charmingly at that, the brown haired
young woman looking down modestly. &quot;Yeah, well,&quot; she
put her glasses on, adjusting them slightly. &quot;I have
to keep in practice,&quot; she said.

Rachel and Kitty fell into step as they left the lower
levels and went up into the school itself, heading to
the room they shared. &quot;You should really be teaching
the kids basic martial arts, too,&quot; Rachel said,
&quot;you&#39;re clearly good at it.&quot;

Kitty shook her head with a laugh as they went down
the hall, &quot;I&#39;m busy enough with the computer classes
and the team.&quot;

&quot;And how&#39;s that been going?&quot; Rachel asked her as she
opened up the door to their room and they headed
inside.

&quot;A bit odd,&quot; Kitty conceded. She strode over to her
closet even as she began to strip away her workout
outfit as she said, &quot;Hank, Scott, Logan and I all get
along fine, but Emma Frost and I have some history...
it&#39;s hard for me to trust her.&quot;

Rachel gulped as Kitty pulled the top of her leotard
off, revealing small, perky breasts unrestrained by a
bra. Slipping her shoes off Kitty bent over to pull
the rest of it off, revealing a rounded bottom that
made Rachel&#39;s mouth go dry with desire. &quot;Emma hasn&#39;t
done anything, has she?&quot; she asked, her throat a bit
raspy.

&quot;No, thankfully.&quot; Kitty paused, looking over her
shoulder at Rachel&#39;s gaze and smiled slightly, feeling
unusually bold as she murmured, &quot;If you don&#39;t stop
staring I&#39;m going to have to take steps.&quot;

Rachel&#39;s face went a charming pink as she quickly
looked down, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

Kitty grabbed a long shirt and pulled it on, enough
clothes to preserve modesty at least. &quot;No, I&#39;m the one
who should be sorry Ray,&quot; she said, walking over to
where Rachel stood and laying a gentle hand on the
other woman&#39;s arm, &quot;I know how long it&#39;s been, for
you.&quot;

&quot;It has been a long time,&quot; Rachel quietly admitted,
&quot;but for both of us.&quot; She put her hand over Kitty&#39;s,
&quot;But I want things the way they were, back when we
were in Excalibur.&quot; She smiled slightly, &quot;If you want
to, of course.&quot;

A faint blush colored Kitty&#39;s cheeks as she said
firmly, &quot;Of course I do, I was worried you didn&#39;t want
to or I would have said something...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s times like this I wish I hadn&#39;t been so well
trained that it&#39;s impolite to poke around in other&#39;s
minds,&quot; Rachel admitted, &quot;a fast scan would have told
me everything.&quot;

A soft chuckle came from Kitty, &quot;And where&#39;s the fun
in that?&quot;

Rachel slid forward shyly, gently pressing her lips to
Kitty&#39;s, a soft yet incredibly sweet moment that ended
much too soon, really. She studied the other woman&#39;s
eyes as she hesitantly said, &quot;I know about Pete
Wisdom, Pryde.&quot;

Kitty sighed, knowing that this was going to take some
explaining as she guided them to sit on the side of
the nearby bed. &quot;When we lost you in the timestream I
was numb,&quot; she grimly answered, &quot;the pain nearly
overwhelming me. I leapt right into something with
Pete as a bandage for my pain, but he wasn&#39;t you.&quot; A
pause, &quot;Probably why we didn&#39;t last long.&quot;

Rachel sighed, realizing she wasn&#39;t really one to
talk. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she confided to Kitty, &quot;it&#39;s
not like I was celibate while I was gone.&quot;

Kitty let a arm slide across Rachel&#39;s shoulders,
feeling a flash of relief as the other girl relaxed
into her then said, &quot;Makes me feel a bit better.&quot; They
sat there close for a few seconds before she asked,
&quot;So what do we do now?&quot;

The sweet scent that wafted off of Kitty made Rachel a
little light headed, her pulse speeding up as she was
held close. &quot;I could make a few suggestions,&quot; Rachel
answered her honestly.

Kitty brought them together into another kiss, this
one a bit more daring. She parted her lips, letting
her tongue stroke across Rachel&#39;s then slid between
them into the warmth of her mouth. &quot;Me, too,&quot; Kitty
agreed huskily.

Gently Rachel pressed, easing the two of them down
onto the bed as the two of them lay there side by
side. Hesitantly Rachel let her hands slide down from
Kitty&#39;s silkily muscled arms to her chest, stroking
the firm breasts with a long familiarity.

Kitty moaned huskily, the thin shirt that she was
wearing providing little protection to that sensuous
touch. Her nipples ached as they were gently tugged
and pulled, Rachel&#39;s hot mouth slipping down her cheek
to her throat.

&quot;I&#39;ve missed this,&quot; Rachel sighed between planting
delicate kisses on her throat.

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Kitty squealed as ticklish ribs were stroked,
Rachel&#39;s tongue lapping catlike on her breasts, the
T-shirt hiked up for easy access. She tugged at
Rachel&#39;s clothes as the other woman caressed her
before gasping, &quot;Aren&#39;t you a little overdressed?&quot;

Reluctantly Rachel pulled back a bit, grabbing her
shirt by the bottom and quickly yanking it up,
dropping the cloth aside to reveal she wasn&#39;t wearing
a bra. Slowly, almost teasingly she unbuttoned her
pants, the zipper sliding down to reveal red curls.

&quot;Going commando,&quot; Kitty purred, hands reaching out to
help Rachel wiggle out of her pants while pulling her
nude body close.

&quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do this for weeks,&quot; Rachel murmured as
their hands began to roam once again, &quot;if we hadn&#39;t
talked about it soon, I was going to jump you or
something.&quot;

Kitty laughed as she nipped at Rachel&#39;s neck, &quot;Now
there&#39;s a mental image.&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t seen anything yet,&quot; Rachel said
dangerously.

&quot;Promises promises,&quot; Kitty purred as a thigh slid
between her legs, the two of them beginning to roughly
slide together.

They kissed wildly, mouths melding as excitement rose,
movements becoming more frantic as the bed squeaked.
Finally with muffled cries of ecstasy both women found
release, collapsing in a tangle of limbs in the middle
of the sweat soaked bed.

Rachel stroked Kitty&#39;s shoulder&#39;s absentmindedly, the
two laying there catching their breaths. &quot;So what do
we do now?&quot; she asked.

Kitty looked up at her, smiling fondly. &quot;I&#39;m not
interested in hiding,&quot; she said softly, &quot;not that
it&#39;ll surprise anyone much.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Rachel asked.

Kitty blushed faintly. &quot;I was kinda pushy with Scott
about making sure we&#39;d be sharing a room,&quot; she
confessed, &quot;he can probably guess why.&quot;

&quot;If not Nightcrawler will probably tell him,&quot; Rachel
shrugged, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure he saw us together once,
back when we all lived in the lighthouse.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather everybody knows,&quot; Kitty said, &quot;I&#39;m proud
to be with you, love.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Rachel admitted, hugging her close.

End

Notes: Set during the same time frame as Astonishing
X-Men and New X-Men: Academy X&#39;s re-launches, though
any relationship between Kitty and Rachel is a product
of my imagination. The characters of David and Noriko
are both from New X-Men while the Danger Room
modifications were first highlighted in Astonishing X-Men.
