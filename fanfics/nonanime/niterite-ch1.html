<h1>'Night's All Right for Fighting</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Disclaimer: For those who haven&#39;t read it
yet, Gold Digger is a manga style comic series
featuring treasure hunting adopted sisters named Gina
and Brittany Diggers. On one of their adventures a
clone of the two of them was created, combining both
their memories and DNA, called Brianna, who has since
searched for her own identity.


Brianna paused in the archway, the athletic looking
young blonde looking around her thoughtfully. Dressed
in just a one piece bodysuit in blue with a gold
T-shirt over the top, she knew that she was drawing
peoples&#39; eyes. &#39;Then again,&#39; she smiled impishly,
&#39;that seems to be the point. Wish I had brought my
guns, though.&#39;

The fully packed stadium was going wild, the crowds
roaring happily as one by one their favorite fighters
made their dramatic entrances into the fighting arena.
Brianna recognized the names of some adventurers that
she knew, mixed with many that she didn&#39;t. Her friends
Gar, Luan, Ryan and the others had had such a good
time at the last Ultimate Fighters competition they
attended that she had decided to try it out for
herself.

Another pice of pounding rock music rang out, a new
figure descending the ramp to loud cheers. A man
dressed in a butler&#39;s uniform raised a mic to his full
mask, &quot;Unworthy ones, bow down before your Mistress!&quot;

After waiting a moment for the full effect she strode
forth, thigh hugh black leather boots becoming
visible, a tiny little leather bathing suit straining
to hold back her many charms, and a long black mane of
hair styled back in a single wave. &quot;The Mistress is
here,&quot; she declared, voice like a whip crack,
sunglasses covering her eyes.

&quot;She makes quite the entrance, huh?&quot; the slim
redheaded referee said as she ran over to her side.
Dressed in baseball cap, T-shirt and shorts she looked
surprisigly cute, clutching her clipboard to her
chest. &quot;Ms. Diggers,&quot; she smiled, &quot;you&#39;re going to
need to qualify.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Brianna nodded, even as she found
herself wondering why the leather clad lady had looked
so familiar to her. &#39;Never mind,&#39; she shook her head
slightly, dispelling the thought. &quot;I&#39;ll be doing a
test match, I guess?&quot; she asked as she fell into step
behind the woman, taking the opportunity to look the
competition over.

Flamboyance seemed the order of the day, fighters
dressed in the most outrageous costumes. Men tended to
wear styles based on warrior types, from the &#39;street
fighter&#39; look to ninjas and even samurai, while the
girls tended more towards tight outfits that revealed
a great deal of skin. With a wry smile Brianna
realized she was positively dowdy looking in her
clothes of choice!

&quot;You&#39;ll be paired up against another newcomer,&quot; the
girl said, jogging a bit to keep ahead of her, &quot;and
the judges will rate your abilities from the match.&quot;
They reached the cage, where a muscular young man
waited impatiently.

&quot;Who dares challenge,&quot; he growled, long red hair
flowing over his shoulders, muscles gleaming, &quot;the
mighty Samson?!&quot; Massive golden arm bands and a
matching belt gleamed over his red costume, the
material looking nearly painted on the man&#39;s rippling
muscles.

Brianna smirked, looking him over thoughtfully. &#39;At
least he&#39;s got some muscles,&#39; she noted admiringly,
&#39;and that little spandex costume looks good.&#39; Brianna
pushed her blonde hair back and introduced herself,
&quot;Brianna Diggers.&quot;

The announcement rang out as the two looked each other
over, seeking any kind of weakness, &quot;A qualifying
match is about to begin! The Mighty Sampson...&quot;

&quot;Samson!&quot; he bellowed in correction.

&quot;...versus Brianna Diggers!&quot; the announcer finished.

&#39;Diggers?&#39; Ayane blinked in surprised recognition from
her place not far from the ring. The black leather
woman turned around to look down curiously, her
stylish black mane flowing down her back. Simply
called Mistress she played the role of a villain in
the ring, her skimpy black one piece revealingly
dangerous. &#39;I wonder if she is one of Luan&#39;s friends?&#39;
she mused, having visited the Diggers residence a few
times to see Luan.

Ayane studied the blonde woman with interest, a slight
smile teasing her red lips. The young woman down below
there was dangerously athletic looking, slim but
beautifully strong, standing there with a smooth sort
of gracefulness. The man who was facing her was
massive, his muscles bulging, and Ayane studied them
both thoughtfully.

&#39;If Brianna isn&#39;t at least reasonably capable,&#39; Ayane
thought to herself seriously, &#39;he&#39;s going to do her
some real damage.&#39; She leaned forward to get a better
view even as her lips curled up in a deadly smile,
&#39;This should be good.&#39;

Samson cracked his knuckles loudly, smiling down at
her grimly. &quot;Do you want to give up now?&quot; he asked
with a sinister expression.

Brianna didn&#39;t answer him aloud, standing there calmly
she simply smiled back and then made a &#39;come here&#39;
gesture with her hand. Samson took the invitation and
charged, swiftly grabbing for her smaller form only to
find that she wasn&#39;t there. With an inhuman burst of
speed Brianna leapt up and over him, twisting in
midair like a dancer before dropping down right behind
him to deliver a powerful kick right to the middle of
his back. Samson staggered, whirling around, then he
looked as her with a great deal more wariness.

&#39;I can&#39;t win this on just my speed alone,&#39; Brianna
thought, rushing in to try and close with him. She
grabbed at his massive body, trying to throw the
taller man, then she cried out in surprise and alarm
as he grabbed her!

&quot;Ha!&quot; Samson laughed. With a speed far greater than
his bulging muscles would imply he turned it around,
brutally flinging Brianna into the side of the cage
with devastating force.

&#39;She could be in trouble,&#39; Ayane noted as she heard
the clang of flesh hitting the metal wire, sliding her
black sunglasses down a bit to get a better look as
Brianna fell to the floor with a thump. Her eyes were
odd looking, almost cat slitted, creating the illusion
of inhuman coldness that few found the ability to see
past.

&quot;Care to give up, little girl?&quot; Samson laughed as
Brianna struggled back to her feet.

&quot;Gloating,&quot; Brianna pulled herself back to her feet
with a wince, &quot;when the fight isn&#39;t over is just
stupidity.&quot; Shaking off her pain she was so quick that
he didn&#39;t even see the first kick coming, the blonde
rocking his head back with both feet. Using the force
of shoving her body off the ground she continued the
motion, hitting the far wall then vaulting back right
towards him.

The next blow slammed the staggered fighter face first
up against the cage wall, then he went right through
the heavy mesh to pound into the outer cement wall
itself. He staggered for a moment on the floor of the
stadium, fighting to recover, then dropped out cold.

&quot;Brianna wins,&quot; the referee loudly declared, her voice
amplified to be heard over the growing cheers of the
crowd. She walked over to the judges, letting them
talk together for a moment, then she picked up a sheet
of paper. Breaking into a grin as she finished reading
she announced, &quot;Brianna Diggers has been given an &#39;S&#39;
class rating!&quot;

Brianna strode out of the square ring, ignoring both
the referee and the loudly approving roar of the crowd
to jog over to where Samson was being helped to his
feet by two medical attendants. &quot;Is he all right?&quot; she
asked them with a worried frown, thinking, &#39;I didn&#39;t
hit him too hard, did I?&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Samson smiled as he waved her off with a
casual hand, &quot;but thanks.&quot; He looked much more
friendly as he added, &quot;You were pretty impressive in
there.&quot;

&quot;Well, thanks,&quot; Brianna smiled.

&quot;I was wondering if we could maybe go back to my hotel
room after the match,&quot; Samson said with a leer, &quot;get
to know one another better.&quot;

Pow! Brianna strode away from the once again out cold
fighter with a scowl, her fists still clenched. &quot;Talk
about pushing your luck,&quot; she muttered to herself,
shaking her head with amusement. Retrieving her bag
from a locker she got out a bottle of water, drinking
it down thirstily then wiping off her mouth with the
back of her hand.

&quot;Not bad at all,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice said calmly, the
fighter called Mistress walking towards her with two
men dressed as butlers following behind her.

Brianna tensed unconsciously, frowning slightly as she
took in the black leather clad woman thoughtfully.
&quot;Have we met?&quot; she finally had to ask, still wondering
why the skimpily dressed woman looked so familiar to
her.

&quot;I&#39;m a friend of Luan,&quot; she explained with a
surprisingly gentle smile, &quot;Ayane Hino.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Brianna&#39;s memory finally clicked as she
continued on, &quot;I&#39;ve seen you around Mom and her
students, then.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Ayane agreed. She turned to her two butlers,
&quot;Jeeves, Jarvis I shouldn&#39;t need you for awhile, you
can come get me before the next match.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Mistress,&quot; the first butler bowed to Ayane
formally then the two of them left smoothly, the white
tuxedo clad men still retaining that formal distance
about them.

&quot;Mistress?&quot; Brianna smiled slightly in amusement,
tilting her head questioningly as she looked back
towards Ayane.

&quot;My stage name,&quot; Ayane took her sunglasses off for a
moment, rubbing at her eyes. Her eyes met Brianna&#39;s,
and she felt a jolt as the woman met her gaze so
easily. &#39;She&#39;s not frightened?&#39; Ayane thought in
honest surprise, knowing how easily her eyes could
unnerve someone. &quot;Did Ryan or the others come along?&quot;
she asked.

&quot;I think Luan wanted to,&quot; Brianna grinned, &quot;but she
and Gar are off together.&quot; She looked over Ayane,
taking in her costume up close. &quot;I hope I won&#39;t have
to take on a name like that,&quot; Brianna smiled then
added teasingly, &quot;or dress like that.&quot;

&quot;Is it a bit much?&quot; Ayane asked with amusement as she
looked down at her leather costume. Oddly she found
herself enjoyig the blonde&#39;s shy gaze....

&quot;I bet it distracts your opponents in the arena,&quot;
Brianna found herself looking over the gorgeous young
woman, &quot;it certainly is distracting me.&quot; She felt a
flush coming to her cheeks, &#39;Where did THAT come
from?&#39;

&quot;I think that&#39;s the general idea,&quot; Ayane said, feeling
a bit of blush to her own cheeks, &quot;and it helps to
sell a lot of posters.&quot; Without thinking she slid her
sunglasses back on, feeling the need to protect
herself, somehow.

&quot;Posters?&quot; Brianna blinked.

&quot;Ryan didn&#39;t explain?&quot; Ayane smiled impishly, &quot;I&#39;ll
give you the rundown.&quot; The two women walked around the
arena together, talking quietly. &quot;Like professional
wrestling and other sports,&quot; Ayane said, &quot;we can&#39;t
support ourselves just on ticket sales alone. Each of
us creates a stage identity, marketing ourselves to
sell related merchandise.&quot; She sighed in memory,
&quot;Originally I tried to call myself Ninja Kitty, but it
didn&#39;t work.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Brianna asked curiously.

Ayane slid the sunglasses down a bit to highlight her
striking eyes as she regretfully said, &quot;I scared away
the kids.&quot;

Brianna met her eyes with a casual smile as she
explained, &quot;I&#39;ve seen a lot of things over the years,
especially around my crazy sisters. Judging by
appearances is stupid.&quot;

Ayane smiled back, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She had to look away for
a moment from those warm eyes, a slight blush touching
her pale cheeks. &#39;I feel like I did when I first met
Gar,&#39; she mused, thinking of the boy fondly, &#39;but...
it&#39;s different, somehow.&#39;

&quot;I don&#39;t see myself making up a stage name and stuff,&quot;
Brianna shook her head, &quot;my sister&#39;s archeology work
keeps us all in good shape, money wise.&quot;

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ayane had a devilish look as she
mused aloud, &quot;you could always become my catgirl
slave...&quot;

Brianna blinked, then she laughed aloud. She took a
half-step closer to Ayane, rubbing her cheek against
Ayane&#39;s shoulder as she purred in the back of her
throat. &quot;Like that, you mean?&quot; she asked with a impish
grin.

&quot;You&#39;re a bad girl,&quot; Ayane found herself smiling back
through her fierce blush. &quot;So if you don&#39;t need the
money, why are you here?&quot;

&quot;To see how good I am,&quot; Brianna answered promptly,
&quot;from what Luan told me, this contest has some of the
world&#39;s best.&quot;

&quot;From what I saw in your fight with Samson you&#39;re very
good,&quot; Ayane answered before adding impishly, &quot;when
you&#39;re not being bad, anyway.&quot;

&quot;You should talk to my sisters sometime,&quot; Brianna
straightened up, wishing for a moment to just stay
there beside Ayane, &quot;they&#39;ll tell you stories.&quot; She
was surprised at how easily they fell into this casual
conversation, normally she wouldn&#39;t be so open with
someone. Yet somehow she found herself teasing and
playig with this stranger....

Ayane felt an odd sense of relief from the idea of
Brianna planning to introduce Ayane to her sisters,
then a flash of surprise that the idea even mattered
to her. &#39;Maybe this isn&#39;t going to be just a casual
friendship,&#39; she thought to herself as she answered
aloud, &quot;I&#39;ll look forward to it.&quot;

There was a flash of movement, and Brianna frowned at
the interuption as one of the Butlers appeared. &quot;I&#39;m
sorry Mistress,&quot; he bowed to them then looked to
Brianna, &quot;but one of Brianna&#39;s matches is coming up
soon.&quot;

Brianna looked a bit surprised, then she nodded
slightly. &#39;I lost track of time,&#39; she realized,
&#39;talking to Ayane.&#39; Flashing the butler a greatful
smile she said, &quot;Thanks.&quot; Brianna turned to Ayane,
&quot;Can I see you after the fights?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Ayane managed before Brianna bolted
off.

&#39;I can&#39;t believe I acted that way around Ayane,&#39;
Brianna mused as she hurried towards the ring, &#39;what
was I thinking?&#39; A blush appeared on her cheeks as her
thoughts lingered a moment on what she had been
thinking about...

&quot;Brianna Diggers,&quot; the announcer declared, &quot;please
report to the ring.&quot;

Brianna banished those thoughts firmly, reaching
ringside just in time. &#39;I&#39;ve got a fight ahead of me,&#39;
she reminded herself firmly, &#39;I can think about it
later.&#39;

&quot;So glad you could make it,&quot; the other fighter
grinned, the tall black haired woman dressed in a
skimpy leotard, black boots and fingerless leather
glothes. She almost seemed cocky, only faltering as
she took in Brianna&#39;s dangerous little smile.

&quot;You interrupted a very important conversation,&quot;
Brianna cracked her knuckles loudly, &quot;and I&#39;m not
happy about it.&quot;

&quot;Then you&#39;ll just have to get satisfaction from me,
won&#39;t you?&quot; she answered softly. She grinned, &quot;The
name is Rachel.&quot;

&quot;Brianna,&quot; she answered. She raised her fists to the
ready position as she drawled, &quot;And trust me, you
don&#39;t have what it takes to satisfy me.&quot;

&quot;Guess we&#39;ll have to see,&quot; and with that Rachel
charged, Brianna moving swiftly to meet her...

Some hours later a tired Ayane toweled off her neck,
looking up at the scoreboard to see the final ranks.
She had done pretty well today, only eliminated in the
final round. She found herself looking for Brianna&#39;s
name up there and raised an eyebrow in admiration on
seeing that she had very nearly made the same level.

&quot;I wonder what it would have been like to compete
against her?&quot; Ayane mused to herself out loud, pushing
her hair back tiredly.

&quot;Against who?&quot; Brianna asked curiously, the tall
blonde limping over to Ayane&#39;s side. Sometime during
the battles she had shifted over to her were-cheeta
form, a coat of whitish fur covering her skin and
giving her a sort of wild beauty.

&#39;She&#39;s beautiful,&#39; Ayane thought in awe, a few seconds
passing before she registered that Brianna was hurt.
&quot;What happened?&quot; Ayane asked her with a fierce frown,
getting up to help ease Brianna down onto the seat
beside her on the bench.

&quot;I landed badly from a jump on top of someone&#39;s head,&quot;
Brianna smiled wryly as she sat down, &quot;I had to bow
out of the next fight because of that.&quot; She added
reassuringly, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, I heal pretty
fast.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s always frustrating when it happens to me,&quot;
Ayane said sympathetically, shifting in her seat and
wincing a bit from her own injuries.

&quot;Are you...?&quot; Brianna looked at her worriedly.

&quot;Just sore all over,&quot; Ayane said with a sigh, &quot;you
need to go all out in these matches to have a chance
to win.&quot;

Brianna nodded slightly, &quot;I saw you fighting, you&#39;re
incredible.&quot; She smiled a bit, &quot;I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t come
up against you.&quot;

&quot;I almost wish I had,&quot; Ayane admitted softly. She
smiled at the startled look on Brianna&#39;s face, &quot;You
looked good in the ring, I&#39;d like to test myself
against you sometime.&quot; She shrugged, wincing a bit at
the soreness.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Brianna admitted. Watching Mistress in the
ring was remarkable... she was poetry in motion,
fighting with a near lethal sort of intensity even
against foes that should have been much stronger. A
bit more disturbing was how erotic Brianna had found
it, watching the almost naked woman fighting, breasts
bouncing in their leather cover.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Ayane asked, noting the blush that
colored the younger woman&#39;s cheeks. &#39;Is she thinking
about the sort of things I am?&#39; she wondered.

&quot;You know,&quot; Brianna looked over at Ayane, &quot;a good
massage can help with that kind of pain.&quot; She smiled
shyly, reaching out to put her hand on Ayane&#39;s
shoulder, &quot;With all the trouble my sisters get into,
I&#39;ve gotten pretty good at it.&quot;

Ayane hesitated, wondering the young blonde had felt
the same spark at that casual touch. She looked away
shyly, &quot;You don&#39;t have to....&quot;

&quot;I want to,&quot; Brianna smiled at her warmly. She rose to
her feet with only a slight wince, offering her hand
to the other woman.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ayane took that hand, standing beside
Brianna. She took a nervous breath, &quot;It might be
easier to massage me back at my hotel room.&quot;

Brianna followed the other woman&#39;s lead, &quot;You know,
I&#39;ve never... &quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Ayane said softly, squeezing Brianna&#39;s hand
gently. She looked into her eyes and Ayane was pleased
that she didn&#39;t flinch, &quot;I assume we&#39;re both on the
same wave length?&quot;

Brianna stepped a bit closer, bringing their faces
close enough for her to kiss the slightly taller
woman. &quot;God, I hope that wasn&#39;t a mistake,&quot; she said
softly once they seperated, looking up into those
striking eyes.

&quot;No, it wasn&#39;t,&quot; Ayane leaned forward to kiss her
back.

&quot;Let&#39;s try that again,&quot; Brianna purred, pulling Ayane
into a deeper kiss.

Author&#39;s Notes: Fred Perry has primarily featured
heterosexual characters in his GD series, with any
same-sex attraction purely in the undertones. Despite
that Brianna intrigues me because she is both the same
as Gina and Brittany (brains and brawn combined in one
person) as well as striving to be different. She has
attempted to rebel from her sisters in the comic in
various ways, but has been as straight as an arrow
like her sisters sexually. Still, I could easily see
her trying a different sexuality than her sisters,
though I wonder if she would only be experimenting.
Ayane Hino a.k.a. the Mistress is a relatively new
character, with a remarkably close relationship with
Luan. A possible romance? Probably not, but it&#39;s
interesting to watch.</pre>
