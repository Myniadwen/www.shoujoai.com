<h1>Kitty and Illyana: A Tale of Magik! (part 16 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>        The Phoenix looked oddly human sitting there, munching on a 
chocolate donut. The five of them sat around a table in the kitchen 
snacking, talking as they tried to adapt to this most unuual guest. 
&quot;It&#39;s been a long time,&quot; Jean noted, licking some of the chocolate off 
of her fingers.

        &quot;Coo,&quot; Lockheed agreed, the dragon holding his own donut in his 
paws.

        Kitty sipped some coffee to wash the latest donut down, then she 
put her cup on the dining table. &quot;Can you tell us anything about the 
threat that we&#39;ll be facing in the future?&quot; the brown haired woman asked 
curiously.

        Phoenix shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, my memories are clouded 
around this foe... something I think he may have done intentionally.&quot;

        &quot;Wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Rachel said, her short red hair shining 
in the light.

        Illyanna grabbed another donut from the box on the middle of the 
table, &quot;We&#39;d better make sure that the Sanctum defences are at full 
strength.&quot; The intense blonde smiled grimly as she added, &quot;There&#39;s 
always a chance that he&#39;ll attack in this era.&quot;

        &quot;We think alike,&quot; Kitty murmured. She frowned slightly, &quot;Though 
if this enemy can mess with the Phoenix, I&#39;m not sure what our defences 
can do.&quot;

        &quot;He&#39;s not all that powerful in a cosmic sense,&quot; Phoenix calmly 
reassured them, &quot;he simply has a power that I am vulnerable to.&quot; The 
fiery redhead paused a moment as if hearing something off in the 
distance then calmly said, &quot;I need to go.&quot; With that she shimmered, 
becoming faintly transparent, then she was simply gone.

        &quot;Coo?&quot; Lockheed looked up in confusion.

        Illyanna blinked in surprise then looked over at Rachel, &quot;Does 
she do that often?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Rachel nodded with a sigh, drinking some coffee. &quot;I 
think it has to do with her duties as the Phoenix force, but I&#39;m not 
entirely sure,&quot; she said.

        &quot;Either way it&#39;s not our problem,&quot; Kitty said, finishing off 
another donut. She wiped her hands off with a napkin and said, &quot;We 
should get to work reinforcing the defences, just in case.&quot;

        &quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Illyanna said, licking cream filling off a 
finger.

        Rachel hopped to her feet, &quot;I&#39;d like to help if you&#39;ll let me.&quot;

        The three went into the workroom, Kitty and Illyanna each moving 
to grab certain books from the shelves. They carted the books over to 
the table, flipping them open as they looked up the information they 
needed. Rachel watched the two work, each pointing out things to the 
other as they worked, finally settling on a strategy.

        Kitty and Illyanna stood in the center of the room, a pentacle 
drawn on the floor. Around the edge runes in a Norse style were written, 
while three candles glowed in the semi darkness. Illyanna spoke first, 
invoking certain powers, then Kitty took her turn, voice ringing out. 
There was a odd sensation, a warmth on their skins, then it was gone.

        &quot;And that,&quot; Kitty pushed her hair back with a smile, &quot;should be 
that.&quot;

        Rachel shook her head slightly, &quot;I barely followed that, 
honestly.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;re experimenting with a new shield,&quot; Illyanna said in 
explaination.

        Kitty was rubbing out the circle with a cloth as she said, &quot;We 
altered the outer layer of our shields, it should be more reflective.&quot;

        &quot;So if someone does attack,&quot; Rachel found herself smiling 
slightly, &quot;he&#39;ll be blasted by his own power bouncing back?&quot;

        &quot;You got it,&quot; Illyanna smiled evilly.

        Kitty looked a little pale, pushing her hair out of her eyes. 
&quot;We&#39;d better go raid the rest of those donuts,&quot; she said.

        &quot;Right,&quot; Illyanna agreed, the three young women wiping out the 
rest of the food. She sighed softly, wiping off her mouth, 
&quot;Conservationn of energy, you burn fuel whenever you cast spells.&quot;

        &quot;And the shielding took a lot of power,&quot; Rachel mumured. She 
smiled at them slightly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry for the trouble.&quot;

        &quot;No trouble,&quot; Kitty shook her head, &quot;we were planning to upgrade 
the shields anyway.&quot;

        Illyanna stretched out, rising up onto her toes. &quot;Do you still 
want to go out to the Witching Hour?&quot; she asked.

        Kitty nodded, &quot;Yeah, I think so. A seige mentality will just 
limit our options.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve brought me there once in the future,&quot; Rachel said. She 
paused, &quot;You did bring me. You will bring me?&quot;

        &quot;English really isn&#39;t good to talk about things that have 
happened to you but still remain in other&#39;s futures,&quot; Illyanna said 
sympathetically, &quot;and don&#39;t get me started on alternate futures.&quot;

        &quot;Lets go get changed,&quot; Kitty smiled.

        Rachel went up the stairs, entering her new bedroom. She walked 
over to the closet, laying her hand on the door as she concentrated on 
what she wanted. With an impish smile Rachel pulled out the items she 
wanted, stripping off her plain clothes and getting changed.

        Kitty smiled, standing in the front enterance way waiting 
patiently. Her button up shirt was white, dark blue pants hugging her 
slim hips. Illyanna descended the stairs, her blonde hair flowing around 
her as the red dress swirled around her slim form.

        &quot;What do you think?&quot; Illyanna asked, smiling at her lover 
impishly.

        &quot;You look wonderful,&quot; Kitty breathed out, stepping forward to 
gently kiss her. She was careful not to muss her too much, but Kitty 
just had to do it.

        Rachel walked down the steps, pausing to avoid disturbing the 
two women. Her black pants were skin tight on long legs, the t-shirt 
almost painted on. To preserve m,odesty she had a leather jacket on, the 
redhead looking dangerously sexy.

        Illyanna eased back, then her eyes widened as she saw their 
observer. &quot;Would you look at that,&quot; she murmured.

        Kitty followed her eyes and blinked at Rachel. She offered the 
young woman a grin, &quot;We&#39;re not going to the Hellfire Club, you know.&quot;

        Rachel blushed, but she looked pleased. &quot;If you want, I could go 
change into my first choice for the evening,&quot; she offered impishly.

        Kitty and Illyanna looked at each other for a second. &quot;I know I 
shouldn&#39;t ask,&quot; Illyanna finally sighed, &quot;but what were you going to 
wear?&quot;

        Rachel tilted her head to the side, the redhead grinning. &quot;I was 
going to go with leather pants,&quot; she said, &quot;with a full red leather 
corset instead of a top....&quot;

        Kitty blushed furiously, &quot;You&#39;d probably start a riot.&quot;

        &quot;Remind me to start experimenting a bit with what the magical 
closets will actually produce,&quot; Illyanna noted.

        Rachel snickered, &quot;You&#39;d be surprised.&quot;

        The three headed out, the two slightly older teens and Rachel, 
walking the streets of the Village together. The city noises swirled 
around them, comfortingly normal as they made their way to a side 
street, descending the stairs to a club set below the street level.

        Luna beamed at them as they entered, &quot;It&#39;sd good to see you all 
here again.&quot; The black haired woman led them through the crowd.

        &quot;Again?&quot; Rachel blinked, &quot;But I haven&#39;t visited here... I mean, 
not yet anyway.&quot;

        Luna smiled slightly, &quot;You&#39;ll be taking a few other time trips, 
Miss.&quot;

        Before Rachel could question her Luna had sat them down at one 
of the tables and walked off. &quot;Well, well,&quot; the dirty blonde haired man 
murmured, looking Rachel over. &quot;Ow!&quot; he yelped as the the young woman in 
stage magician&#39;s garb slapped him upside the head.

        &quot;She&#39;s jail-bait, John,&quot; Zatanna scowled at John Constantine.

        &quot;I was just looking,&quot; Constantine complained.

        &quot;Neat place,&quot; Rachel murmured, taking in the sights, completely 
ignoring all the looks that she was drawing. She frowned, &quot;But why 
didn&#39;t she wait to take our orders?&quot;

        &quot;The cook&#39;s a precognitive,&quot; Kitty explained, &quot;she knows what 
we&#39;re going to be ordering long before we do.&quot;</pre>
