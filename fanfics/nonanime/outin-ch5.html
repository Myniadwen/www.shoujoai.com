<h1>Outside In (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/outin-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Kim smirked as the ninja monkey hit the floor.  It had been three years, 
and Lord Monkey Fist never taught his legions of ninja monkeys anything 
new.  It was too easy nowadays to beat both monkey and master.  As she 
caught the last monkey by the tail and threw him aside, Monkey Fist 
leapt at her feet first.  They fought for a few minutes, but Kim easily 
tripped him and put her foot on his chest to keep him down.

&quot;Curse you, Kim Possible!&quot; he growled while panting.

&quot;You know, you say that every time,&quot; Kim said in turn.  &quot;When is this 
curse going to come into effect?&quot;  Monkey Fist grinned at her, pulling a 
small remote from the inside of his sleeve.

&quot;Now,&quot; he chuckled simply.  He pushed the large red button on the 
remote.  When nothing happened after a moment, he pushed it again.  
Monkey Fist pushed the button a multitude of times, growing 
progressively paler with each failed press.

&quot;Aw, is the monkey looking for his laser?&quot; Shego&#39;s jeering voice called 
down from the high wall of the monkey kung-fu master&#39;s compound.  She 
stood beside the demolished ruins of a tracking laser gun, smugly 
looking at her nails.  Monkey Fist broke down in sobs at his newest 
failure.

When Interpol arrived (Monkey Fist had set up his base in Spain of all 
places this time round), the lieutenant detective greeted Kim and handed 
her a check before rounding up the monkeys and Monkey Fist.  Shego 
walked up behind Kim and put her arms around the red-haired woman.

&quot;Ooh, this was a good one,&quot; she said, spying the hefty figure on the 
check.  &quot;Glad you finally started charging for services rendered.&quot;  Kim 
laughed and leaned back into Shego&#39;s embrace.

&quot;Glad you started working with me,&quot; Kim replied.  &quot;Everything 
seems...almost too easy right now.&quot;  Shego kissed her on the cheek.

&quot;Well, call it practice for when the world really needs us,&quot; she 
murmured.  &quot;And even if we have trouble, we do have a friend or two 
waiting in the wings.  Come on-let&#39;s go home.&quot;

----------

&quot;You can stop hiding behind that tree if you want to.  You aren&#39;t even 
trying anyway.&quot;  Tao stepped out from behind the lone, bare tree in the 
cemetery and walked to stand a few feet away from Farrah.  The 
brown-haired woman stood in a long black coat, staring down at two 
headstones.

&quot;How&#39;s your leg?&quot; Tao asked gently.  Farrah let out a soft laugh.

&quot;You nearly die because of me and you ask me if I&#39;m all right,&quot; she 
murmured in wonderment.  &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;  She finally looked up at Tao and 
nearly began to cry at the bandages covering the left half of the 
silver-haired woman&#39;s face, as well as the sling her right arm rested 
in.  Tao smiled at her.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said.

&quot;You&#39;re a liar,&quot; Farrah said, rubbing at her eyes.  She frowned when her 
hands came away damp.  &quot;You lost an eye and you were shot.  Don&#39;t tell 
me you&#39;re fine.&quot;  She knelt down, weeping openly now for the pain Tao 
had suffered, and in remembrance of her mother, who was buried just 
before her.  Tao took a few tentative steps forward before crouching 
down in front of Farrah.

She pulled the sling from her torso, tossing it aside before reaching up 
to untie the bandages around her head.  The bandages fluttered to the 
ground, revealing the four fresh scars over Tao&#39;s left eye.  Farrah let 
out a sob and reached out, burying her face in Tao&#39;s chest as she cried. 
 Tao lifted one of Farrah&#39;s hands and put it over the scars, smiling at 
the other woman as she did so.

&quot;You should know something about me,&quot; she explained.  She pulled 
Farrah&#39;s hand away, revealing an open, perfectly intact golden eye.  &quot;I 
can heal myself like you wouldn&#39;t believe.  I&#39;m fine.&quot;  Farrah sniffed 
and rubbed at her eyes.

&quot;Why are you here?&quot; she asked in confusion.

&quot;To visit your mother,&quot; Tao replied.  &quot;I thought I should, now that I&#39;ve 
told you everything.  And I&#39;ve just been making sure that you&#39;re all 
right.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because I love you.&quot;

&quot;How can you?  I&#39;ve blamed you for my mother&#39;s death for years.  I&#39;ve 
called you a monster for years.  How can you love me?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, but I do.&quot;  Farrah smiled slightly.

&quot;Fine.  Then let me do this.&quot;  She leaned to Tao and kissed her.  After 
a moment, she pulled back.  Tao smiled at her.  Her tail slowly swung 
about her, the appendage holding two red roses.  She laid one on the 
grave of Farrah&#39;s mother and handed the other to Farrah.  The two women 
walked from the cemetery, hand in hand.  The sun shone in the cloudless 
blue sky in a moment of perfection.  The moment did not fade.
