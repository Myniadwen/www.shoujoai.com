Faster than most vehicles the red clad figure zipped
across the city of Keystone, then seemed to disappear
as the Flash finally came to a stop. The red costume
was shed in less than a blink of an eye then Iris West
laughed, the sandy haired young woman walking over to
her fridge at a much more normal pace.

&quot;Oh my god, I actually have a date,&quot; Iris laughed as
she fetched a soda, a real spring in the jeans clad
lady&#39;s step.

As the Flash she didn&#39;t date much, for several
reasons. Most of the men she ended up meeting were
either criminals or cops, neither of which were her
type, or fellow superheroes. Sadly most of the members
of the new Justice League were women, and while most
of them were also lesbians, it wasn&#39;t exactly her
style.

Cracking open her pop Iris chuckled to herself,
sitting down in one of her living room chairs. &quot;Well,
there was that time Lady Midnight got me drunk at the
Justice Society,&quot; she remembered that night fondly,
&quot;but that&#39;s about it.&quot;

Soon after Flash joined the League she and her friend
Kyla, the modern Green Lantern, had gone to New York
to recruit Firestorm, one of the local heroes and she
had been instantly charmed by him. Despite the
unearthly white eyes and fire for hair the young man
came across as a good guy, one that Iris wanted to get
to know better...

The latest meeting up at the Justice League Watchtower
had just come to a close as they grabbed some coffee
and snacks, members moving off to talk together.
Firestorm had lingered by a window, gazing out at the
Moon&#39;s surface silently. Mustering her courage Flash
had walked up, &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;

&quot;Only a week ago I was fighting bad guys in New York,&quot;
Firestorm smiled, his red and gold uniform hugging a
slim body, &quot;now I&#39;m on the moon preparing to fight off
the Injustice Gang and a possible alien invasion. It&#39;s
a bit much to absorb.&quot;

Iris felt a sudden burst of sympathy for him. &quot;I know
what you mean,&quot; she admitted as she pushed the red
cowl of her costume back to reveal her sandy hair,
&quot;the level of strangeness in this life does take some
getting used to.&quot;

&quot;Have you been doing this long?&quot; Firestorm asked her
curiously.

&quot;Couple of years now,&quot; Flash shrugged, &quot;I started out
as Kid Flash shortly after my powers first
manifested.&quot; A laugh, &quot;It was a goofy outfit, but I
liked it.&quot;

&quot;So why did you move on to being the Flash?&quot; Firestorm
looked at her thoughtfully.

Flash hesitated a moment then she quietly admitted, &quot;I
just thought I should, especially after my father
died.&quot;

Firestorm visibly winced. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he said, &quot;I
didn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, not many people do,&quot; Iris put her
hand on his arm with a gentle smile.

&quot;I know what it&#39;s like to inherit a heroic legacy,&quot;
Firestorm said to her quietly, &quot;it can be quite a
burden at times.&quot;

&quot;Very true,&quot; Iris agreed, knowing that most of the new
League would agree with him.

Firestorm looked out the window, seemingly searching
his thoughts then he asked, &quot;Are you busy later
tonight?&quot;

A faint blush colored Iris&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Well no, unless
the Rogues or something hits the city,&quot; she said as
casually as possible.

Firestorm smiled, &quot;I&#39;ve enjoyed talking with you, I
was wondering if we could go hit Warriors or something
and continue this.&quot;

&quot;In costume or out?&quot; Iris asked, curious about how the
young man really looked. Firestorm hesitated and Iris
quickly added, &quot;It&#39;s okay, I shouldn&#39;t have asked.&quot;

Firestorm smiled slightly, &quot;No, it&#39;s all right, I need
to trust you and the other Leaguers eventually. When
did you want to meet?&quot;

Iris grinned, &quot;How about seven?&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Firestorm moved off, &quot;I&#39;ll see you
there.&quot; He waved good-bye to a few others then headed
off down the hall towards the teleporters, and
guiltily Iris found herself looking admiringly at his
very nice butt.

Iris finished dressing, her long pants and stylish top
accented with gold earrings and a simple necklace. She
would have liked to have worn a skirt, maybe, but Iris
had to keep in mind the possibility there might be an
emergency of some kind. She could pull on the Speed
Force to create a costume as needed, but doing it
while wearing a skirt would be a problem.

Checking the time Iris decided it was time to go, so
with a burst of speed she locked up the apartment and
was gone. Keystone was a old fashioned city, not that
far from New York, and with her natural speed the bar
was only seconds away, even with a detour to pull a
cat out of a tree.

Warriors was busy as usual, the corner night club
having a line going around the corner. Of course the
door-woman recognized any superheroes in or out of
costume, the android quickly waving them inside.
Passing beneath the neon sign Iris nodded, &quot;Good
evening, Mechanique.&quot;

The golden skinned android nodded in return, &quot;Good
Evening, Miss West.&quot; Mechanique smiled slightly, her
movements casual as she opened the door, &quot;I understand
it&#39;s been a while since you&#39;ve visited the club.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try to more often,&quot; Iris said as she went by.

The club was busy, a brightly colored homage to the
great battles of superheroes. There where replica
weapons from the Invasion in one section, several
deactivated Manhunter robots, Amazon armor and
weapons, Green Arrow&#39;s trick arrows, a DEO badge and
many other unique items on display all around the
room.

&quot;Hey, Iris,&quot; Guy Guardner waved as she walked up to
the busy bar, &quot;it&#39;s been awhile.&quot; The muscular man had
a bit of gray in his buzz-cut but his part alien
heritage had helped keep him youthful looking and fit.

&quot;Considering Kyla no longer works here,&quot; Iris said
dryly, &quot;I have no other reason to put up with your
wandering hands.&quot;

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Guy laughed as he pulled a mug of her favorite
beer then passed it over. &quot;Your friend is in the Green
Lantern lounge, an&#39; I hope you have fun.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Iris took the beer, then headed off through
the press of people. &quot;At least Firestorm didn&#39;t pick
the Flash section,&#39; she thought with some amusement.

The Green Lantern Lounge was guarded by another
deactivated Manhunter, lit by replicas of the Green
Lantern power batteries. Going by a statue of Hal
Jordan Iris scanned the tables, surprised only to see
a dark red haired young woman waiting.

&quot;Iris,&quot; the lady waved, &quot;over here.&quot;

Iris walked over, studying the young woman
thoughtfully. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said apologetically,
&quot;do I know you?&quot;

She offered her hand, &quot;I&#39;m Rebecca Raymond.&quot; She
smiled a bit wryly, &quot;I guess it would be better if I
just showed you.&quot;

Rebecca got up and closed her eyes in concentration, a
shimmering glow building all around her body. With a
burst of light she transformed in a instant, a nearly
completely different person standing there. Firestorm
gave her a faintly apologetic look, the strangely
white eyes sympathetic, then in another burst of power
reverted to Rebecca.

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Iris dropped limply into a seat, only her
fast reflexes saving her from spilling some of her mug
of beer.

Rebecca sat down at her own seat, looking into her
drink with some embarrassment as she softly said, &quot;I&#39;m
sorry.&quot;

Iris took a moment to collect her thoughts the
admitted, &quot;I can&#39;t decide if I should feel stupid,
angry or just amused by it all.&quot;

Rebecca shook her head, &quot;This is part of why I don&#39;t
like making friends as Firestorm... the sort of
confusion that comes up.&quot;

A very disturbing thought occurred to Iris and she
found herself asking, &quot;Do you actually become male as
Firestorm?&quot;

&quot;No, that would be a little too odd,&quot; Rebecca
admitted, &quot;I seem to be genderless.&quot;

&quot;Is this why you kept your identity a secret from the
rest of the group?&quot; Iris asked.

&quot;Yes, and to protect my adoptive family,&quot; Rebecca
said. She left her drink as she got up, walking to the
entrance, &quot;I think I&#39;ve wierded you out, I&#39;d better
go.&quot;

Iris reached out to grasp Rebecca&#39;s hand, smiling up
at her. &quot;I&#39;m a bit shaken,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but I don&#39;t
want you to go.&quot;

Rebecca studied her a moment then returned to her
seat. &quot;All right,&quot; she took a drink, smiling across
the table at Iris, &quot;should we get dinner?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Iris said.
