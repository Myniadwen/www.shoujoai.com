<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>Dani Moonstar sighed as she leaned on the control
panel, watching the icon representing where the
&#39;copter waited. Pushing her black hair back she
sighed, &quot;I wish we knew what was going on out there.&quot;

Rahne nodded glumly, the redhead standing beside her.
&quot;We canna use the radios, we might let a enemy know
they&#39;re there,&quot; she agreed.

&quot;And Rachel hasn&#39;t contacted us telepathically
either,&quot; Dani scowled.

&quot;Grr,&quot; Lockheed growled low in his throat, the little
dragon pacing restlessly on the large meeting table.

&quot;I guess we&#39;re just stuck with waiting,&quot; Rahne sighed,
&quot;however long it takes.&quot;

A soft clearing of a throat signaled Cecelia&#39;s
entrance, the dusky skinned doctor looking around in
annoyance. &quot;Where is everyone?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;Sit yourself down,&quot; Dani said, &quot;it&#39;s a long story.&quot;

Meanwhile, the remainder of Excalibur cautiously made
their way down the underground tunnel. A small
flashlight along with light radiating from Widget gave
them dome idea of their surroundings, but not too
much.

&quot;Do you want me to scout ahead?&quot; Spitfire asked again,
the white haired young woman&#39;s voice strong and eager.

&quot;Hell no,&quot; Pete Wisdom answered promptly as they
walked along the cavern, his eyes searching into the
darkness, &quot;Marvel Girl&#39;s telepathy is being blocked by
something down here, and there&#39;s no way we&#39;d know if
something goes wrong.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Jackie sighed, Spitfire pushing her white
hair back.

&quot;Sorry Pete,&quot; Marvel Girl winced, Rachel Summer&#39;s
short red hair falling into her eyes.

&quot;Are you all right, love?&quot; Kate Pryde asked softly,
the silver skinned woman called Widget looking at her
in alarm.

&quot;Just a headache from trying to break through the
psionic shields here,&quot; Rachel admitted, &quot;they&#39;ve very
tough.&quot;

&quot;I wonder why Sinister would have a base out here in
the middle of nowhere for?&quot; Britannia asked quietly.
Lisa Garrison moved at point with the wary confidence
of a long time agent, the blonde studying the shadows
almost as warily as Pete.

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised where he has bases,&quot; Pete said
with a shrug, &quot;I understand he even had a base beneath
New York&#39;s Times Square.&quot;

&quot;I can see something up ahead,&quot; Llyan said quietly,
the elfen woman&#39;s eyes piercing the gloom better than
a human&#39;s would.

Slowing a bit they moved forward, the darkness slowly
being lit up by a almost unearthly glow up ahead in
the tunnel. Cautiously they moved up until they
reached the edge of the tunnel and a larger chamber
then peered inside before freezing in surprise.

&quot;Bloody Hell,&quot; Jackie cured softly in surprise.

&quot;Yup, I&#39;d say this confirms it&#39;s a Sinister
operation,&quot; Pete said dryly, blinking as he tried to
take all of it in.

The chamber pulsed with an eerie green light, long
containers of matching fluid strung up throughout the
massive hall. Within human figures floated mindlessly,
clones waiting to be awakened on order. In the middle
of the machinery, control panels and monitors were
working constantly as four figures stood to one side.
Two of them held a third figure by the arms, the final
one looking on curiously.

&quot;Can we get closer? I can&#39;t hear what they&#39;re saying,&quot;
Rachel said with a scowl.

&quot;Your wish is my command,&quot; Kate gave her a smile as
she extended a hand cautiously around the corner, the
metal shifting into a small high powered microphone.
Her other hand shifted to form a speaker, familiar
voices coming from it.

&quot;You&#39;ve led me a merry chase, Mr. Bjornson,&quot; Mr.
Sinister said coldly, his red eyes glowing from a pure
white face, the gem on his brow shining evilly.

&quot;Let me go, you...&quot; Steve snarled back, struggling in
the arms of the beings who held him.

&quot;That would be foolish,&quot; Sinister answered flatly. He
reached out to touch the hammer insignia once again,
&quot;Now, tell me what you know about the Asgardians.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t the Endtech data have it?&quot; Steve actually
looked amused.

Sinister reached out swiftly to grab his throat. &quot;Do
not trifle with me, boy,&quot; he hissed, squeezing with
superhuman force.

&quot;Do.. It,&quot; Steve hissed out defiantly.

Sinister cast him aside, visibly gaining control of
his temper. &quot;I have access to almost all superhuman
data,&quot; he said grimly, &quot;but the Asgardian has always
escaped my grasp. That was what I wanted from
Endtech.. and you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me... you seriously want to
clone Thor!&quot; Steve looked up at him in pure disbelief.

&quot;The Asgardians are flesh and blood,&quot; Sinister
replied, &quot;and so I know it can be done. I just need a
sample.&quot;

&quot;And as Bezerker I&#39;m Asgardian enough to serve,&quot; Steve
realized.

&quot;Correct,&quot; Sinister nodded. A cold smile, &quot;So will it
be a live sample, or cells taken from your corpse?&quot;

Everyone exchanged glances once they heard that.
&quot;Pete, we can&#39;t let him,&quot; Kate started urgently.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Pete agreed crisply.

Just as Spitfire raced from cover... a explosion
rattled the entire cavern, throwing everyone off
balance. &quot;Now what?&quot; Britannia growled, looking around
them wildly even as some of Sinister&#39;s creatures
hurried towards them.

BOOM!

The wall to the far side of the cavern exploded inward
as several figures emerged from the spreading dust
cloud. &quot;We&#39;re here for our teammate,&quot; Codex said
calmly, the blonde in a simple jumpsuit leading her
comrades in.

&quot;More foes?&quot; Llyan asked, sword held at the ready.

&quot;Maybe, maybe not,&quot; Pete said, watching the situation
unfold.

&quot;So,&quot; Sinister said with an air of supreme confidence,
&quot;you betray me, too?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d say the betrayal is on your end,&quot; Sienna Blaize
said from where she stood beside Codex, &quot;when you
cloned us without permission.&quot;

Sinister looked amused, &quot;It was allowed in the
agreements you signed with me.&quot;

&quot;Targets acquired,&quot; Freelance reported in her
mechanical tones as the armored woman took aim,
&quot;firing.&quot; The first blasts of her long gun took out
the two creatures holding Bezerker, then one splashed
right into Sinister&#39;s body. Surprisingly it barely
staggered him.

Above them cloning chambers exploded open on some
silent signal, various copies of beings who had served
Sinister in the past draining down to attack like
human guard dogs. Reaper, Thermal, Skids and Shades
worked to hold them off, even as Bezerker raced back
to their side against the horde.

&quot;Pete?&quot; Kate asked with some urgency.

&quot;Get to a computer, try to erase any of the data they
got from Endtech,&quot; Pete ordered then turned to the
others, &quot;looks like we&#39;re backing up the Marauders.&quot;</pre>
