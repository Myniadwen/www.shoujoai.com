<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>        After dropping her first bombshell about her and Sakura 
training together Kitty stopped Rogue from signaling the others with a 
gentle hand on her arm. &quot;There&#39;s something else I have to tell you 
about, first,&quot; she said softly.

        Rogue looked down at her lover in concern, &quot;Are you... what&#39;s 
wrong?&quot;

        &quot;While I was under &#39;Ogun&#39;s mind control,&quot; Kitty almost looked 
like she was forcing herself to speak, &quot;Sakura had sex with me.&quot;

        There was a long moment of silence as Rogue digested that 
little fact, then she softly asked, &quot;Did she rape you?&quot;

        &quot;Not exactly,&quot; Kitty sighed, &quot;but I certainly wasn&#39;t in my 
right mind at the time.&quot;

        Rogue clenched her hand into a shaking fist as she hissed, 
&quot;I&#39;ll kill her!&quot;

        Kitty gently put her hand on Rogue&#39;s, &quot;No, you&#39;re not.&quot; She 
met her gaze calmly, but a fire glittered in her eyes, &quot;I&#39;ll be the 
one who&#39;ll be facing Sakura.&quot;

        Rogue puffed out a breath, letting her fist uncurl, &quot;All 
right. But if you get into any trouble, it&#39;ll be my turn.&quot;

        Kitty smiled slightly, &quot;Then I guess I better not get into 
trouble.&quot;

        Out in the abandoned outback town, Sakura stood in front of 
the sealed lab doors. &quot;McCoy and Lord Stryfe will remain locked in 
there,&quot; she explained to Feral, Polaris and Plasma, &quot;until the 
treatments are complete.&quot;

        &quot;Too bad,&quot; Feral sniffed. The orange catgirl looked just a bit 
peeved off as she added, &quot;I was looking forward to getting a good 
shagging from McCoy.&quot; She smiled suddenly, &quot;Guess I&#39;ll have to go into 
town for my fun.&quot;

        &quot;Use an image inducer on the trip,&quot; Sakura quietly ordered 
her, &quot;and do not draw any undue attention to yourself.&quot;

        &quot;Aww, that takes all the fun out of it,&quot; Feral whined.

        &quot;Don&#39;t play games, Feral,&quot; Sakura&#39;s voice dropped down to a 
deadly purr, &quot;or you may find yourself facing me.&quot;

        A sexy smile appeared on Feral&#39;s face, &quot;Spank me, momma. I&#39;ve 
been a bad girl.&quot; With that, hips swaying she slinked out of the 
chamber.

        Sakura actually looked a bit surprised, &quot;What was that about?&quot;

        Polaris cleared her throat, &quot;From what I&#39;ve heard about her in 
X- Force, she was very bi. Not to mention a bit into S &amp; M.&quot;

        Sakura shook her head with a sigh, &quot;Just what I need, another 
complication.&quot; She looked over at Plasma, &quot;What&#39;s Nemesis&#39; condition?&quot;

        &quot;Still doped to the gills and sealed up in his very own 
containment chamber,&quot; Plasma reported. Softly she asked, &quot;What does 
Stryfe plan to do with that nutbar?&quot;

        &quot;Whatever Stryfe decides,&quot; Sakura said coldly.

        &quot;He isn&#39;t a tactical weapon,&quot; Polaris murmured softly, &quot;he&#39;s a 
weapon of mass destruction. Stryfe will probably just drop him into a 
city and let him cut loose.&quot;

        &quot;Simply put but essentially correct,&quot; Sakura nodded, fixing 
Lorna Dane with a look, &quot;do you have any problems with that?&quot;

        &quot;No, we don&#39;t,&quot; Plasma quickly spoke up, jabbing Lorna with 
her elbow.

        &quot;No, no problem,&quot; Lorna agreed, rubbing her sore side.

        &quot;Good,&quot; with that, Sakura turned and was gone, leaving the two 
women alone.

        &quot;Lorna, what did you think...&quot; Plasma started.

        &quot;Wait,&quot; Lorna held up a finger. She lead Plasma away from the 
lab, then her magnetic powers pulsed outward in a wave of green. &quot;I 
just disrupted the camera&#39;s here temporarily,&quot; she explained.

        &quot;We&#39;re being monitored?&quot; Plasma blinked. She shook her head, 
&quot;What were you thinking? Do you really want to cross Sakura or 
Stryfe?&quot;

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Lorna said softly. &quot;Nemesis is a killing machine, and 
that is exactly how they&#39;re going to use him,&quot; she said intensely.

        &quot;And what about your agreement with Stryfe?&quot; Plasma asked 
pointedly.

        Lorna sighed softly before admitting, &quot;I&#39;m rather beginning to 
doubt that he&#39;s ever going to fulfill his end of that bargain.&quot; She 
looked up at Plasma and said, &quot;You might want to consider if he&#39;ll 
keep his deal with you, either.&quot;

        &quot;And if he doesn&#39;t?&quot; Plasma looked away.

        Lorna took a few steps down the dark hallway, &quot;I think I&#39;d be 
willing to watch your back for you, if you want.&quot; With that, she 
walked away, leaving a rather bemused looking Plasma standing there 
behind her.

        Back at the beach house Ororo was sitting down along with 
Kitty and the others in the large living room, Kitty softly explaining 
to them all about the memories that she had recovered. Her revelations 
about Sakura brought a moment of stunned silence to the room.

        &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Kitten,&quot; Ororo finally murmured.

        Kitty smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

        &quot;No, you&#39;re not,&quot; Sage corrected her dryly, &quot;but we&#39;ll have to 
deal with the trauma of what you went through later on.&quot; She leaned 
forward to ask, &quot;Can you give us an idea of Sakura&#39;s skills, relative 
to your own?&quot;

        &quot;Back when we were training under &#39;Ogun we were pretty evenly 
matched,&quot; Kitty admitted, &quot;but when she lead the Hand cadre, I marked 
her.&quot;

        &quot;You have an edge,&quot; Elizabeth noted, &quot;but it may not be a 
large one.&quot;

        &quot;You got it,&quot; Kitty agreed.

        &quot;I still can&#39;t quite get my head around all of this,&quot; Neal 
admitted, &quot;you two trained together under the ninja master &#39;Ogun?!&quot;

        &quot;But how does this information help us now?&quot; Bishop murmured 
softly from his post by the door. He was waiting for a call from Cat, 
and didn&#39;t want to miss it.

        &quot;It gives us insight,&quot; Raven pointed out from her seat beside 
Ororo. She looked over at Kitty, &quot;Why do you think Sakura is after 
you?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not professional,&quot; Kitty said thoughtfully, &quot;but deeply 
personal for her. She probably thinks she&#39;s avenging her Master&#39;s 
honor.&quot;

        &quot;Wouldn&#39;t going after Wolvie do that?&quot; Rogue asked curiously.

        &quot;Sorry love,&quot; Kitty smiled up at her, &quot;for &#39;Ogun and Logan, 
their fight was intensely personal. Hell, &#39;Ogun has even chased Wolvie 
from beyond the grave.&quot;

        &quot;So instead she goes after the one she sees as the other 
betrayer of &#39;Ogun,&quot; Heather said to them quietly. Lifeguard looked 
oddly uncomfortable with the whole discussion, but she was hanging in 
there anyway.

        Sage put her hand on Heather&#39;s comfortingly before turning to 
the others, &quot;So how does this effect our over all strategy?&quot;

        &quot;We could draw Sakura out,&quot; Kitty said thoughtfully, &quot;she&#39;s 
probably answer a challenge.&quot;

        &quot;Not until we know where the Brotherhood is based,&quot; Ororo 
said, &quot;we could use it then to try and splinter their organization.&quot;

        &quot;So where could they be?&quot; Rogue murmured.

        &quot;It&#39;s a shielded facility,&quot; Elizabeth said thoughtfully, &quot;or 
Cerebra would have picked up on Stryfe and friends by now.&quot;

        &quot;Doesn&#39;t narrow it down very much,&quot; Neal pointed out, &quot;I&#39;ve 
done some reading, and the Sentinel bases, Sinister, Apocalypse, all 
of them used shielded locations standard.&quot;

        &quot;When we last encountered Stryfe,&quot; Rogue mused, &quot;he was using 
a old pyramid as his base.&quot;

        Kitty looked at her thoughtfully, Rogue had that odd look on 
her face, like she almost had something. &quot;Yes?&quot; she prompted her 
gently.

        &quot;For the sake of argument, lets say he&#39;s still using old 
bases, refitted to suit his needs,&quot; Rogue said softly, &quot;isn&#39;t there a 
place in Australia that would suit him perfect?&quot;

        An odd look passed over Ororo&#39;s face, then she began to curse 
softly, &quot;The old Reavers base! It was shielded, had an extensive set 
of underground chambers, and has been abandoned since Pierce and his 
last band of Reavers were destroyed!&quot;

        Sage went over to the computers, &quot;Pryde, give me a hand. We&#39;re 
going to hack into a spysat and see if we can get some images of that 
piece of the Outback.&quot;

        Kitty bounced to her feet and followed, &quot;Right. Should we go 
through Norad, NASA or try for the CSA mainframe?&quot;

        &quot;NASA,&quot; Sage answered. At Kitty&#39;s odd look she explained, &quot;The 
Canadian space agency has better security than you might think.&quot;

        &quot;Should I try a fly by?&quot; Rogue asked eagerly.

        &quot;Not until we get some other confirmation,&quot; Ororo shook her 
head, &quot;we could spook them, otherwise. Let&#39;s see what Kitty and Sage 
turn up first.&quot;

        &quot;To set up a base out there Stryfe had to buy and ship a lot 
of materials,&quot; Bishop noted, &quot;bet that&#39;s traceable, too.&quot;

        &quot;Right after we do the spysats,&quot; Sage called.

        &quot;What do we do once we confirm they&#39;re out there?&quot; Heather 
asked softly.

        &quot;Start planning our assault,&quot; Ororo said softly, &quot;Stryfe and 
McCoy have had the genetic samples of the X-Men for a substantial 
period of time. I can not believe they haven&#39;t used them.&quot;

        Within the sealed chamber it was nearly silent except for the 
dripping of an IV tube, feeding into the armored figure&#39;s bare arm. &quot;I 
can feel it,&quot; Stryfe said softly.

        &quot;Sir?&quot; McCoy turned to him, even as he prepared another 
injection.

        &quot;Parts of my brain are awakening, unused potentials opening 
up,&quot; Stryfe murmured, &quot;I can feel my powers growing already.&quot;

        &quot;And this is just the beginning,&quot; McCoy injected him 
cheerfully, &quot;imagine what you&#39;ll be by the end of the week.&quot;

        A cold smile and Stryfe said, &quot;What I am becoming is every 
Dreamer&#39;s nightmare.&quot;
