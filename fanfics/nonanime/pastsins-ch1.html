<h1>Past Sins</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Introduction: This story is set in the same time frame
as the recent X-Men relaunch issues, along with the
debut of Astonishing X-Men. The characters all belong
to Marvel Comics, I&#39;m just borrowing them for a little
while. This will also have some yuri (girl/girl
sexual) content, so if that offends you I&#39;d recommend
skipping this story.

Astonishing X-Men: Past Sins

The moon shone outside the bedroom window as they lay
together, the noises of the mansion gradually fading
out around them. Scott Summers looked over at Emma,
his brown hair falling down over his goggle covered
eyes as he smiled slightly.

&quot;What is it, Scott?&quot; Emma Frost asked him curiously,
her long white-blonde hair gleaming in the moonlight.
The woman seemed entirely unashamed of her nudity, her
nearly perfect body on display for her lover&#39;s every
whim.

&quot;It has been a very long day,&quot; a smiling Scott quietly
admitted, thinking back to everything that had
happened in the past few hours.

They had officially reopened the school today in the
aftermath of Magneto&#39;s bloody attack on New York,
welcoming both the students and teachers back home.
All the tours of the new facilities, re-organizing the
X-teams around new members and old, it had been busy
for all of them. Especially welcoming back Ororo and
the others from the Xtreme X-Men into the fold.

Scott frowned in thought as he asked, &quot;And what is it
between you and Kitty?&quot;

&quot;I was an enemy of the X-Men for a very long time,&quot;
Emma reminded him archly, &quot;you know that there still
are some hard feelings over that.&quot;

Scott shook his head slightly. &quot;No, I&#39;ve almost gotten
used to seeing that reaction,&quot; he said, &quot;this was
something more personal.&quot;

Emma was silent a moment, the woman looking at him
thoughtfully. &quot;It happened a long time ago,&quot; she
finally said, &quot;and it was... sexual.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Scott sounded casual.

Emma chuckled wickedly, &quot;Don&#39;t give me that, Summers.
I know how much men like to hear about things like
this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just concerned as the co-headmaster of the
school,&quot; Scott said seriously, but a slight smile
teased at his lips.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Emma said dryly. She sighed, tilting her
head back as she remembered, &quot;It wasn&#39;t long after the
Professor founded the New Mutants....&quot;



Kitty Pryde weakly struggled in the wooden chair, the
brown haired young woman fighting with all her will to
move her body. Emma&#39;s powerful mind held her there,
this intensely intelligent young lady, and she felt a
bit of admiration for her. Most would have just given
up by now but Kitty fought on, struggling to be free.

&#39;Poor child,&#39; Emma thought with a smile, her fur lined
white cloak swirling around her. She wore the
traditional garb of the White Queen of the Hellfire
Club, the fetishtic clothes that the club demanded.
Thigh-high white leather boots, a skimpy matching
thong and bustier barely concealed her charms, plenty
of her healthy skin exposed.

&quot;When the X-Men get here....&quot; Kitty growled out, her
clothes a bit rumpled from her capture earlier that
evening. She had accompanied her friend Douglas Ramsay
to the Academy, hoping to protect him from Emma&#39;s
influence but had been easily subdued by Emma&#39;s
telepathic gift.

&quot;And why would they be concerned?&quot; Emma asked. She
smiled as she let her hand rest on Kitty&#39;s shoulder,
&quot;From Doug&#39;s perspective nothing has gone wrong.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lying,&quot; Kitty scowled.

Emma used the physical contact to forge a telepathic
link between them, despite the shields that protected
Kitty&#39;s innermost thoughts, then she linked them to
Doug. &quot;Observe,&quot; Emma smirked as she summoned what
Doug saw, the young man and Kitty dancing away at a
party at the Academy.

&quot;No,&quot; Kitty managed weakly.

&quot;Young Mister Ramsay carries quite a torch for you,&quot;
Emma noted, &quot;were you really unaware of his feelings?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lying,&quot; Kitty tried to shake her head, &quot;we&#39;re
just friends.&quot;

Emma bent forward to purr, &quot;Denial is such a terrible
thing.&quot;

As Emma moved she caught a flash in Kitty&#39;s thoughts,
something unexpected as her white leather bound
breasts were exposed to the girl&#39;s view. &#39;Well, well,&#39;
she thought as she extended her telepathic probes,
skimming across the girl&#39;s shields.

&quot;Get out of my head,&quot; Kitty grit out.

Emma found a weakness, sliding her power into the gap
like a slim knife. She bypassed the rational thoughts,
slipping by the most defended areas of her mind and
went for the more primal aspects, the darker parts of
the consciousness that were often denied.

&quot;I never would have guessed,&quot; Emma purred, her cheek
resting against Kitty&#39;s, letting her scent wash over
the girl. &quot;You like the weather witch....&quot;

Private fantasies and the most secret dreams flowed
from the darkest recesses of the girl&#39;s mind, things
that she might have never admitted to aloud. Storm,
her long white hair flowing over glossy brown skin,
furtive glances snuck while changing or out by the
pool. Walking into the community showers once, looking
longingly as a pulse raced uncontrollably....

&quot;I like Peter,&quot; Kitty softly protested, a few tears
glistening at the corners of her eyes as she tried to
deny the truth.

Emma stood close to the girl, feeling the younger
woman&#39;s involuntary reaction to her body. &quot;Yes, you
do,&quot; Emma agreed, &quot;but you desire her, too.&quot; She
reached out, gently resting her hands on the front of
Kitty&#39;s shirt, feeling the racing of her heart.

&quot;What are you...?&quot; Kitty blurted.

&quot;You don&#39;t need to just continue to fantasize,&quot; Emma
met Kitty&#39;s eyes, leaving her hands right where they
were over Kitty&#39;s breasts, &quot;I can give you what you
want.&quot;

The pale looking Kitty maintained stony silence,
meeting Emma&#39;s eyes coldly. Still, there was something
else, a slight spark of interest there that the
younger woman did her very best to try to hide and
knew that she couldn&#39;t manage it.

&quot;I&#39;m a telepath,&quot; Emma said, gently reaching into
Kitty&#39;s mind for one of her hottest private fantasies,
cloaking herself in it. Pale skin went brown, blonde
hair went white as Ororo met Kitty&#39;s gaze as she
purred, &quot;Come to me... Kitten.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not real,&quot; Kitty groaned.

Ororo&#39;s black leather top was pulled open in a single
gesture, revealing those breasts that had so
fascinated Kitty. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to....&quot; she reached
out, gently tugging the now free Kitty forward,
drawing her mouth to those orbs.

Kitty&#39;s tongue rasped as it stroked across the flesh,
leaving a wet trail as she gave in at last. Soft moans
followed as she bit gently, sucking wildly as she was
pulled from one breast over to the other. Her hands
slid around to her back then down over her dusky
lover&#39;s hips.

&quot;There,&quot; Ororo purred, taking Kitty&#39;s hands and
drawing them down.

With a sigh of surrender Kitty slid her fingers over
now damp leather, sliding beneath the smooth material.
Across bare skin to the wet cleft of flesh then into
enfolding warmth, feeling deep satisfaction at her
lover&#39;s cries....

Emma pulled the bustier back in place, threading the
leather garment back together over her now sweetly
sensitive breasts. &#39;Kitty&#39;s quite the lover,&#39; Emma
thought as she gazed at the exhausted girl in the
chair, wetness glistening on her face. Her thong
squished slightly as she turned away, her thoughts
occupied with what she might do if Kitty could be
brought over to their side.

Kitty opened her eyes, looking up at Emma dazedly.
&quot;Ororo?&quot; she managed, then sleepy eyes widened as
shock and fury boiled up from within.

Emma felt a flash of regret at the girl&#39;s reaction,
but hid it well. &quot;Not quite,&quot; Emma purred, &quot;but you
were wonderful...&quot; she smiled wickedly, &quot;Kitten.&quot;



Emma sighed softly as she continued, &quot;Of course, now I
regret giving in to my temptation but at the time,
Kitty was exquisite.&quot;

&quot;Well, at least I can understand Kitty&#39;s reaction,&quot;
Scott said with a sigh, holding Emma close to him,
&quot;her and Ororo working closely together again and here
you are to remind her about her naughty fantasies of
the past.&quot;

&quot;Not just in the past,&quot; Emma murmured. As Scott looked
at her in surprise Emma shook her head, &quot;You didn&#39;t
notice how she and X&#39;ian have been spending more time
together?&quot;

Scott blinked, &quot;Damn....&quot;

The End

Author&#39;s Notes: This is mostly based on two comics,
the New Mutants first battle with the Hellions and
their rescue of Kitty and Doug along with the first
few issues of Astonishing X-Men. Kitty&#39;s reaction when
she meets Emma again is interesting in how strongly
emotional she seems in her hatred of Emma. I wondered
if there wasn&#39;t a deeper reason that Kitty disliked
Emma and thought back to something that might have
caused it. The Kitty X&#39;ian relationship was hinted at
in the mini-series Mechanix, where the lesbian X&#39;ian
developed a very close relationship with Kitty.
