troll.&quot; The brown haired woman watched the remains burn from a safe 
distance, &quot;Tough bastard.&quot;

&quot;Oww,&quot; Jenny Calendar groaned as the others helped her from the wreckage 
of Giles&#39; car, the older woman still dazed by the impact.

&quot;Hospital?&quot; Buffy asked as the tough blonde looked at Tara.

Tara nodded as the dark brown woman said seriously, &quot;It should just be a 
concussion, but it&#39;s best to be safe.&quot;

&quot;Good work, all of you,&quot; Giles said, looking at Jenny with gentle 
concern. He shook himself, &quot;It appears I&#39;ll need a lift.&quot;

&quot;Just a minute,&quot; Faith said briskly as she drew out her cellphone and 
dialed a number. &quot;Hi,&quot; she said, waiting a moment then, &quot;Can you do me a 
favor? Meet us near the old oak outside of town, thanks.&quot;

&quot;Who you calling?&quot; Buffy wondered.

&quot;Devon MacLeish,&quot; Faith said as she put the phone away, &quot;he owes Tara 
for letting his band play at the Bronze. I figure he can drive G-man and 
Jenny to the hospital.&quot;

Buffy picked up something in her voice and she looked at Faith 
curiously, &quot;You&#39;re not coming?&quot;

Faith shrugged as she said, &quot;Someone sent that troll, maybe we still 
have a chance of back-tracking it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t let Jenny fall unconscious,&quot; Tara advised Giles then nodded to 
Faith, &quot;She&#39;s right. I&#39;ll see what I can do about tracking it too.&quot;

&quot;Just be careful,&quot; Willow murmured grimly.

Not long afterward Giles and Jenny were loaded up into the band&#39;s 
battered van, Tara and the others promising to follow them as quickly as 
they could. The young intern at the ward quickly confirmed that it was a 
concussion and that Jenny needed to stay there under observation for a 
few hours.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Buffy frowned as they waited in the ward, &quot;I wish this place was 
more secure. I keep waiting for a vamp to jump us.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Willow said grimly as they watched Giles sitting by Jenny&#39;s 
side, &quot;the hospital is a public place, so vampires aren&#39;t blocked like 
they are in a home.&quot;

&quot;Wis we knew if Amy had that troll followed,&quot; Buffy murmured grimly as 
she swept the room with her eyes, looking for anything that might 
indicate a vampire was there.

Willow stood off to one side, her nerves tingling as the scent of blood 
stirred her vampire instincts. She could fight it, of course, but it 
still made being here vaguely uncomfortable for the young woman. 
&quot;Buffy,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;do you want us to patrol the area, just in 
case?&quot;

Buffy thought about it but shook her head no. &quot;If something does happen 
I want us near Jenny,&quot; she answered quietly.

Willow&#39;s eyes narrowed in thought as she asked her, &quot;Do you think the 
vamps are monitoring the hospital?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t put it past them,&quot; Buffy answered honestly.

The next few hours were tense, to say the least. Buffy and Willow moved 
through the larger ward in turns while Jenny lay resting with Giles by 
her side, covertly readying themselves for whatever might come. The 
doctors seemed to consider asking them to leave several times, but while 
the ladies were frightening they weren&#39;t actually doing anything wrong.

The young doctor gulped as Willow gave him a deadly gaze, then 
concentrated on finishing the exam. &quot;Well, no signs of more serious 
injury,&quot; he managed with false cheer, &quot;I think you can be released.&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Jenny smiled wryly as she saw her guardians breath a sigh 
of relief.

&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; Giles said as he looked into her eyes, &quot;when you were 
hurt, I...&quot;

Jenny squeezed the hand she was holding gently as she quietly answered, 
&quot;I know.&quot;

Checking out they exited the building, thanking the gods that the skies 
were overcast enough for Willow to be out in the day. &quot;We&#39;d better get 
you home,&quot; Willow said, &quot;I&#39;m sure Jenny needs some rest and relaxation 
right now.&quot;

&quot;I phoned the school for you both,&quot; Buffy said quietlyas Giles was about 
to half-heartedly offer to go into work, &quot;they know Jenny&#39;s injured and 
you&#39;re taking care of her.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Giles pushed his glasses up tiredly, &quot;I should have thought 
of that.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Buffy smiled at him comfortingly even as she warily watched their 
surroundings, &quot;being attacked rattles everyone.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of attacks,&quot; Willow said as they boarded Devon&#39;s borrowed van 
once more, &quot;where are the vamps?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t look a gift horse in the mouth,&quot; Jenny said dryly as they set off 
for Giles&#39; home.

&quot;I&#39;d better call Dawn too,&quot; Buffy sighed as she dug her own phone out, 
knowing she was going to get a lecture from her little sister too.

&quot;Buffy, where were you!&quot; a rather annoyed Dawn answered her phone after 
a ring, &quot;I just got home and no one&#39;s here.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Buffy sighed, &quot;something came up...&quot;

&quot;Vampire or monster?&quot; Dawn guessed.

&quot;Monster,&quot; Buffy said as she informed Dawn of what happened and passed 
her condolences on to Jenny. &quot;Stay at home and lock up,&quot; Buffy ordered, 
&quot;we might be out for a bit tonight, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll have the leftovers,&quot; Dawn sighed before they signed off.

The phone rang again and Buffy answered it with a sigh, &quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;We found their old hideout, I think,&quot; Faith said eagerly, &quot;and it looks 
like they left in quite a hurry.&quot;

&quot;Left a trail?&quot; Buffy guessed.

&quot;Not a great one,&quot; Faith conceded, &quot;but I&#39;m hopeful.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t go after them on your own,&quot; Giles snatched the phone to say 
seriously, &quot;we have no idea how many vamps they have made.&quot;

&quot;Yes, mother,&quot; Faith said with a sigh.

&quot;All right, perhaps that was a bit much,&quot; Giles conceded.

&quot;Besides, I&#39;m too busy holding back Tara to do anything stupid,&quot; Faith 
said dryly. Tara&#39;s ex-lover Amy had been turned to a vampire several 
years ago, and her recent rise to prominence in the vampire community 
was putting quite a strain on Tara. She seemed torn between trying to 
save Amy and putting her out of her misery...

&quot;Ah,&quot; Giles conceded as he passed the phone to Buffy.

&quot;The trail is heading out of town,&quot; Faith said to her briskly, &quot;we&#39;ll 
follow as far as we can then phone in.&quot;

&quot;Just be careful,&quot; Buffy cautioned.

&quot;Always,&quot; Faith answered before signing off.

Tara smiled grimly as they skulked along the forested drive, the light 
of morning begin ng to touch the summer sky. She could nearly feel the 
passage of magical forces as they walked, what could be best described 
as a odd tingle behind her eyes.

&quot;Blood on the road,&quot; Faith murmured, &quot;they went this way.&quot;

&quot;The summoner too,&quot; Tara agreed as they walked together. She looked 
about as she said, &quot;At least they&#39;re going to ground soon.&quot;

They came around a bend and saw what resembled a English home, with a 
tall fence and lavish garden. The building was three stories tall with a 
pointed roof and balconies on the upper floor, and maybe large enough 
for two families. The only oddity was how all of the windows had been 
shuttered with paper and other materials applied to the inside of the 
window sealing off all daylight from outside.

&quot;Vampire central?&quot; Faith guessed as they warily watched from cover.

&quot;The windows are a hint,&quot; Tara agreed dryly, &quot;and... there&#39;s a aura of 
death here.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s take a look around,&quot; Faith said as they carefully edged around 
the building, tooking for points of exit and entrance, &quot;then we&#39;d better 
get out of here.&quot;

&quot;We could always just set the building on fire,&quot; Tara offered 
thoughtfully.

&quot;Tempting,&quot; Faith conceded, &quot;but there could be human captives.&quot; She 
looked over at Tara and took her hand comfortingly, &quot;I understand you&#39;re 
impatient, love, but we need the whole crew for this.&quot;

Tara sighed softly but nodded, &quot;You&#39;re right, of course.&quot;

Taking some photos with her phone for good measure Faith nodded 
seriously, &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;

In the shadows the magician watched the two women leave, wondering how 
his vampire mistresses would react to their coming. &#39;Either way,&#39; 
Lindsey McDonald thought as he headed back to the house, &#39;things are 
going to be interesting.&#39;
