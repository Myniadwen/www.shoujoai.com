purple hood sitting in his lap as the green suited criminal ate a
sandwich, &quot;when can we get out of here?!&quot;

&quot;Calm down,&quot; Thunderball said grimly, the black man in yellow and
green looking out the flop house window, &quot;we have to stay
undercover, for now. When Amora needs us, she&#39;ll call.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m with Wrecker,&quot; Bulldozer sighed, his silver armored head
reflecting the lamp light, &quot;I&#39;m going stir crazy here.&quot;

Piledriver nodded, &quot;We gotta get out of here, man!&quot;

&quot;And do what, go directly to jail?&quot; Thunderball pointed out. &quot;I&#39;d
rather be cooped up here than locked up.&quot;

&quot;Aww, shuddup,&quot; Wrecker scowled.

Ever since their jewelry heist had been foiled by Warbird and
Thunderstrike, the Wrecking Crew had been holed up in this
safehouse, bored out of their minds. All four were wanted men, so
wandering around outside was out, and there was only so long you
could play videogames and watch tv.

&quot;I&#39;ve HAD IT!&quot; Piledriver suddenly burst out, leaping to his feet
then jumping right through the open window.

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Thunderball cursed.

&quot;After him!&quot; Wrecker yelled as they raced off after their teammate,
all three emerging on the street as car horns honked and people
cried out in surprise.

&quot;Ah, LA,&quot; Bulldozer smiled, &quot;no other city like it.&quot;

Not long after, Amora the Enchantress looked at her fixer and
assistant with a pained expression. &quot;You&#39;re joking,&quot; the gorgeous
blonde said flatly, wearing a fine business suit as she lounged on
her throne.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Morgan Stark sighed as the more shabbily dressed black
haired man reported, &quot;it seems the Crew have flown the coop. I&#39;ve
got people monitoring them, and so far they&#39;re keeping a low
profile.&quot;

Amora looked like she had a headache, &quot;Trust me, it won&#39;t last.&quot; She
looked grim, &quot;Any contact numbers they have for me I want erased,
understood? Make sure there are no connections between me and them.&quot;

Morgan looked a bit surprised, &quot;You&#39;re cutting them loose?&quot;

&quot;They cut themselves loose,&quot; Amora answered, &quot;I just want to make
sure they don&#39;t drag me down with them.&quot;

&quot;And your headquarters?&quot; Morgan asked, looking pointedly at the
stage decorated up like a throne room.

Amora sighed with annoyance, &quot;Break it all down, we&#39;ll move to site
b.&quot; Standing up she addressed the young men watching her
worshipfully, &quot;Return to your homes, gentlemen. When you do, I
command you to forget you ever met me.&quot;

As the men shuffled out like sleepwalkers Morgan looked at his
employer curiously, &quot;You&#39;re just letting them go?&quot;

&quot;They no longer interest me,&quot; Amora shrugged. A faint smile tugged
at her lips, &quot;You could say I have a new interest, now.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Morgan said as they went out into the sunlight.

Amora climbed into her car as she said, &quot;Keep me updated on the
Wrecking Crew, if Force Works stops them I want battle footage.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Morgan agreed as she drove off. Frowning to himself he
consulted his personal organizer, &quot;The Crew know too much about
me... I think I&#39;d best take steps.&quot; Dialing a number he
smiled, &quot;Hello, Delilah? I have a little job for you.&quot;

Across the city in the Stane Enterprises base of Force Works, Connie
Leeds drank her coffee as the brown haired woman sat in front of the
team&#39;s monitor center. On the screen in front of her data scrolled
by, including police reports, superhero fan blogs and other sources
of up to date information.

Warbird walked in, the black clad blonde looking at the screen
curiously as she asked, &quot;Anything interesting?&quot;

&quot;Some,&quot; Connie admitted, &quot;but nothing I think we need to handle yet.&quot;

&quot;Like?&quot; Warbird pressed.

&quot;The teen heroes called Runaways are still operating around LA,&quot;
Connie noted, &quot;as are their rivals, the Loners. According to the
police there&#39;s some rumors of renewed trade in MGH, but nothing
confirmed yet.&quot;

&quot;MGH?&quot; Warbird had to ask.

Connie smiled slightly, &quot;Mutant Growth Hormone. It can trigger
temporary powers in people, but they can be very unstable.&quot;

&quot;Let me guess, it causes a high too?&quot; Warbird offered.

&quot;It&#39;s the latest kick,&quot; Connie agreed, &quot;right along side ecstasy and
other party drugs.&quot;

&quot;Lovely, deranged kids with superpowers,&quot; Warbird grimaced, walking
over and pouring herself a coffee.

&quot;Warbird, can I ask you something?&quot; Connie turned in her chair to
face the other woman. &quot;Do you like Thunderstrike?&quot;

Warbird jerked, nearly spilling her cup of coffee. &quot;Of course I like
her,&quot; she said uneasily.

&quot;No,&quot; Connie looked at Warbird intently, &quot;do you LIKE Thunderstrike?&quot;

A blush colored Warbird&#39;s cheeks as she put her cup down on the
meeting table, &quot;Why are you asking me that?&quot;

Connie met her eyes frankly, &quot;Because I think if I got to know her,
I could like Thunderstrike that way.&quot; She smiled grimly, &quot;And you
sure seemed to develop a strong dislike of me when I flirted with
her.&quot;

Warbird looked away, feeling suddenly uncomfortable as she
said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not trying to be mean,&quot; Connie said a bit more gently, &quot;I guess
I just want to know where I stand.&quot;

Warbird puffed out a breath as she sat down, staring down into her
coffee cup. &quot;I really don&#39;t know how to answer you,&quot; she conceded
after a moment, &quot;I&#39;ve never been attracted to another woman before.&quot;

&quot;But you are now?&quot; Connie led. Before Warbird could answer the
monitor screen shifted from a cool blue to a flashing red, and with
a muffled curse Connie turned to check it out.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Warbird demanded as her eyes swept the still
unfamiliar symbols and codes for the LA police department.

&quot;Superhuman incident,&quot; Connie reported, &quot;conflict involving a
unknown superhuman and the Wrecking Crew, near the bad side of town.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ve finally reappeared,&quot; Warbird frowned as she asked, &quot;can you
contact War Machine and Thunderstrike?&quot;

&quot;Already on it,&quot; Connie said.

Warbird hurried to the door, &quot;Tell them I&#39;m on my way there, Connie.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure you shouldn&#39;t wait?&quot; Connie looked at her
worriedly, &quot;the Wrecking Crew out powers you, you know.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just going to check things out,&quot; Warbird promised, &quot;I&#39;ll wait
till reinforcement arrive before acting.&quot;

&quot;I hope you mean that,&quot; Connie said as she turned back to the
monitor board.

With that Warbird raced out of the building and flew skyward, her
long blonde hair flowing in the breeze as the black, gold and red
clad heroine soared from the industrial heart of California to the
lights of LA. The sounds of alarms and sirens brought her to her
goal, and she settled down on a building to watch in surprise.

A woman dressed in purple stood in the rubble, surrounded by burning
cars and the battered bodies of all four members of the Wrecking
Crew. A tall, cool looking blonde she coldly hoisted up Piledriver
as she said, &quot;You four caused me a lot of trouble.&quot;

Warbird winced slightly at the sound of the blow as she watched from
cover. She couldn&#39;t guess how strong the stranger was, but she was
clearly strong or tough enough to defeat four Asgardian powered
beings. In fact, Warbird was seriously wondering if the woman
intended to kill the four of them...

`Not that part of me would mind that,&#39; Warbird admitted to herself
as she drew her camera out and snapped a few shots, `but heroes
aren&#39;t supposed to do that kind of thing.&#39; Tucking it away again she
saw the lady readying to deliver another blow to her helpless foe,
and couldn&#39;t bring herself to wait any more.

&quot;You should have just obeyed orders,&quot; the woman sneered to the
groaning man she held so easily, &quot;now you die.&quot;

&quot;Hold it right there!&quot; Warbird declared boldly, standing to make the
maximum impression in the afternoon light.

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me,&quot; the woman muttered as she dropped
him, &quot;hey hero, this doesn&#39;t concern you.&quot;

&quot;It does if you&#39;re going to kill them,&quot; Warbird answered as she let
herself float, building the energy up inside of her.

&quot;Of course I&#39;m going to kill them,&quot; she laughed and cheerfully
added, &quot;how else do I make my rep in this town?&quot;

Like a bullet Warbird launched herself at her, then was stunned as
she was slapped from the air with a powerful blow. `Okay,&#39; Warbird
shook herself as she rose to face her enemy, `she&#39;s stronger than I
thought.&#39;

&quot;The name&#39;s Delilah,&quot; she smiled cheerfully as she advanced on
Warbird, &quot;and I&#39;m gonna make you regret you ever met me.&quot;</pre>
