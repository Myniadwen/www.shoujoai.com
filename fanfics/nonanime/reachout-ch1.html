<h1>Reaching Out</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/wanubis.html">Wotan-Anubis</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Mirta glared angrily at the paper in front of her with its multitude of 
crossed out sentences. She&#39;d never much enjoyed making homework, but 
this was getting really frustrating. She flung her pen onto the paper. 
It rolled off the paper, over the remaining wood and fell onto the 
ground.

Mirta closed her eyes and sighed.

&quot;Having a bad day?&quot;

Mirta turned around and felt some of her anger and frustration draining 
away at the sight of Flora standing in the door opening. &quot;Kind of. I&#39;ve 
been struggling with my homework. Again.&quot;

Flora gave a half smile, pulled up a chair and sat down next to Mirta. 
&quot;Is it that bad?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a witch, trying to learn fairy magic,&quot; Mirta said. &quot;It&#39;s a whole 
different system.&quot;

Flora took her hand. &quot;I believe you can do it.&quot;

Mirta smiled. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said. &quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;But you don&#39;t think you can?&quot;

Mirta sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I really don&#39;t. Witch magic comes from a 
really dark place, which is probably why I was never all that good at 
it. And I can... I can kind of sense where your magic comes from, but I 
don&#39;t really know how to tap into it.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll figure it out,&quot; said Flora.

&quot;I hope so,&quot; said Mirta. &quot;I can&#39;t stand the thought of having to go back 
to Cloud Tower.&quot; She suddenly smiled. &quot;Anyway, enough rambling. What can 
I do for you?&quot;

Flora shrugged. &quot;I just... felt like being with you for a while. I kind 
of miss you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, me too,&quot; Mirta said softly.

&quot;I probably shouldn&#39;t be saying this, but I really liked having you in 
my room all the time. You being there was... kind of comforting.&quot;

&quot;The only drawback, of course, was me being a pumpkin the whole time,&quot; 
said Mirta, smiling as she did so.

Flora looked away, blushing a little. &quot;Still...&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; said Mirta. &quot;Life was certainly a lot easier for 
me when I was a pumpkin. All I needed to do was sit there and have you 
pamper me.&quot;

Flora chuckled. &quot;I was happy to do it.&quot;

&quot;Then again...&quot;

Mirta lifted Flora&#39;s hand and kissed it. Flora turned, looked at her and 
smiled. Mirta smiled back and, with her free hand, moved an errant 
strand of hair out of Flora&#39;s face.

&quot;There is... something we couldn&#39;t do when I was a pumpkin.&quot;

&quot;Mirta...&quot;

Even if there was something else Flora wanted to say, it was cut off by 
Mirta pressing her lips against her. The fingers of her hand entwining 
with Mirta&#39;s, Flora relaxed and could feel the tension flowing away from 
Mirta&#39;s body as well.

When the girls&#39; lips parted, Flora laughed.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I was just thinking how your turning into a pumpkin might have been the 
best thing that&#39;s ever happened to me.&quot;

Mirta tilted her head and smiled. &quot;Really? And why&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Well, it gave me the time to get to know you for one thing,&quot; said 
Flora. &quot;And when I managed to change you back into a human it was only 
because...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d grown close?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s one way of putting it,&quot; said Flora, giving Mirta a quick kiss.

Flora turned around in her chair and gestured at the door, which shut 
itself and turned the key in its lock. Wordlessly, she stood up. Mirta 
rose as well and not just because Flora was still holding her hand.

The girls sat down on the bed together. They kissed again, a bit more 
seriously this time, Mirta&#39;s tongue entering Flora&#39;s mouth. Flora moaned 
softly and let go of Mirta&#39;s hand so that she could use both arms to 
embrace the girl and pull her close. Her eyes closed, Flora enjoyed the 
warmth of Mirta&#39;s body almost as much as the feeling of Mirta&#39;s tongue 
playing with her own. After a while, Mirta pulled back, but couldn&#39;t 
resist quickly kissing Flora on the lips a few more times.

When they opened their eyes again, the girls burst into a fit of nervous 
giggles.

&quot;Are we... really going to do this?&quot; said Flora.

&quot;Do you want to back out?&quot; Mirta asked.

Flora looked into Mirta&#39;s eyes and gave the only answer she could. &quot;No,&quot; 
she said. &quot;But I am a bit scared.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; said Mirta. &quot;I always feel safe when I&#39;m with you.&quot;

Flora blinked and a small, completely ignored, part of her wondered 
where the tears had come from. Mirta leaned forward, carefully pushing 
Flora onto the bed. When she was completely lying down, Mirta straddled 
her waist and then froze.

&quot;Did anyone ever tell you just how beautiful you are?&quot; she whispered.

Flora reached up and stroked Mirta&#39;s arm. &quot;You just did.&quot;

Mirta smiled, bent down and kissed Flora again. She got off Flora and 
lay down next to her, one arm embracing her, the other making its way 
towards Flora&#39;s top. Flora moaned into Mirta&#39;s mouth when she felt the 
girl&#39;s cold hand touching her breast. The warmth of Flora&#39;s body quickly 
warmed her hand, though, and Mirta started playing with Flora&#39;s breasts. 
It was obvious that the girl didn&#39;t really know what she was doing, but 
her gentle caressing aroused Flora all the same. She could feel her 
nipples growing harder and the heat between her legs becoming wet. Even 
though she was enjoying what Mirta was doing (or was trying to do) with 
her breasts, Flora took the girl&#39;s wrist and guided her hand down into 
her skirt.

Still a bit uncertain, Mirta moved her hand over Flora&#39;s slit. Flora 
closed her eyes, groaned and pulled Mirta tighter against her. Every 
little movement of Mirta&#39;s hand left a trail of flame that burned 
wonderfully through Flora&#39;s body. And then, quite by accident, Mirta&#39;s 
blindly searching fingers found Flora&#39;s clit.

Flora yelped loudly enough to make Mirta jump.

&quot;Did I... did that hurt?&quot; Mirta asked, her voice worried.

Flora opened her eyes. &quot;No.&quot;

The lust filling Flora&#39;s voice made Mirta shiver in a very, very good 
way.

&quot;So that was a good yelp,&quot; said Mirta.

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

Mirta started guiding her fingers with a bit more purpose now. &quot;And it 
was right around... here.&quot;

Flora groaned, her back arching. Mirta grinned and let her fingers 
playfully explore Flora. Her eyes again closed, Flora responded 
instinctively to Mirta, moving her hips, her whole body, to the 
movements of Mirta&#39;s hand. She was moaning, sweating, panting, losing 
coherent speech and coherent thought as the world was smashed away and 
only the pleasure Mirta gave her remained.

Mirta watched the writhing girl with rapt attention. She would never 
have guessed that the things she quite liked doing to herself could 
evoke such a response in Flora. A part of her was even a bit surprised 
that seeing Flora so lost in bliss felt so much better than anything she 
had ever done on her own.

Flora froze for all of a second and then screamed when more joy and 
pleasure than she could possibly comprehend experiencing crashed into 
her and flowed through her. She could only vaguely sense that Mirta was 
doing her very best to draw out her orgasm for as long as she could.

But, eventually, the world reassembled itself.

Panting, Flora opened her eyes again and saw Mirta looking at her, her 
eyes shining with love.

&quot;That was...&quot; she began, but was cut off when Mirta put a finger on her 
lips.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it,&quot; she said. &quot;I think, what I saw said more than 
words could.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; said Flora. With one quick movement, she was suddenly lying 
more or less on top of Mirta. &quot;In that case, allow me to show you.&quot;

And with that, she leaned forward and kissed her.
