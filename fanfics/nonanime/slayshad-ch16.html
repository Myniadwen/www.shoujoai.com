<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>The vampire spat blood as he was slammed to the
ground, the shadowy figure looking down at him coldly.
&quot;Is that all you got?&quot; she asked, the young woman&#39;s
black hair flowing like a wave around her. She wore a
simple black dress, leather boots and gloves
complimenting her bone pale skin.

&quot;Drusilla,&quot; he whimpered, trying to rise, &quot;I didn&#39;t
mean anything by...&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Drusilla said coldly, kicking him in the
back of the head and slamming his face into the cement
floor. With a smooth move she took a broken piece of
chair and plunged into him from behind, turning him
into dust.

The other vampires milled about nervously, looking at
her in fear as Drusilla rose, casting the piece of
wood aside confidently. There was a feral
dangerousness to her, the madness that had once
tainted the pretty young girl was gone, replaced by
much darker impulses. She had arrived only days ago,
but already she commanded much of the city&#39;s vampires
by sheer power and intimidation.

Drusilla swept the room as she said, &quot;I didn&#39;t like
him threatening my precious one, and I hope the rest
of you learned that lesson well.&quot;

The soft sound of heels on stone came from the shadows
and she appeared, slinking from the dark to stand
closely beside Drusilla. &quot;It&#39;s all right, love,&quot; Amy
smiled, her blonde hair flowing over her shoulders,
fangs gleaming, &quot;though I appreciate it.&quot;

Drusilla cupped the other woman&#39;s face, drawing her
near for a kiss. They separated a moment later, a
smile flickering across Dru&#39;s face as she murmured, &quot;I
remember when you burned Spike, it was so exciting.&quot;

&quot;I was sorry about that,&quot; Amy answered gently, &quot;I
didn&#39;t MEAN to destroy him like that.&quot; She chuckled
softly, &quot;I do think things turned out for the best,
though.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Dru purred as Amy stroked her body. She
turned her gaze to the gawking vampires who still
gazed on, &quot;Get going, find what you can on the Slayers
and their allies.&quot;

Amy rested her hand on Dru&#39;s bottom, squeezing
possessively. &quot;And tell me more about Willow,&quot; she
agreed, &quot;I want to meet my sire once again.&quot;

The vampires quickly left, obeying the wills of their
new mistresses, even as the two women stood in the
long abandoned factory. &quot;We&#39;ll need to find a better
den,&quot; Dru moaned as hands cupped her round breasts,
tugging harshly on her pointy nipples, &quot;the Slayers
will come here first, when we send the drones out.&quot;

&quot;We have surprises waiting for them,&quot; Amy reassured
her as they moved to a back room, the scent of blood
lingering in the air, &quot;and weapons they won&#39;t expect.&quot;

&quot;Mmmmph!&quot; the redheaded girl made a muffled sound, her
mouth sealed by a black ball gag, leather bonds tying
her to the mattress in the middle of the room.

&quot;You brought me a present!&quot; Dru exclaimed.

Amy chuckled softly, &quot;Only the best for you, m&#39;love.&quot;
She dropped her voice a bit as she revealed, &quot;She
hasn&#39;t been bled yet, either, fresh for you.&quot;

&quot;Ohhh,&quot; Dru purred, licking her lips as the girl on
the bed began to struggle more violently. She took a
half step forward the stopped, smiling at Amy, &quot;Would
you like to share?&quot;

Amy smiled happily, following Dru over to the bed. Dru
slid in front of the girl, settling comfortably even
as Amy cuddled up behind the terrified girl. &quot;Don&#39;t
fight,&quot; Amy murmured into the girl&#39;s ear, &quot;or we&#39;ll
have to hurt you.&quot;

A single tear trickled down the girl&#39;s cheek and Dru
chuckled. &quot;She really is darling, Amy,&quot; Dru said as
she licked the tear from her face.

Amy chuckled, letting her hands roam over the young
girl&#39;s body. &quot;Do you want to keep her then?&quot; she asked
cheerfully.

&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Dru said thoughtfully as her features
swiftly shifted to the inhuman vamp-face, &quot;how hungry
we get.&quot;

&quot;Mmm Hmmph!&quot; the girl jerked wildly as the fangs
plunged into one side of her neck, her body
convulsing. A second, weaker cry followed as Amy
struck, biting down on the other side.

Amy and Dru held the writhing girl close, both
enjoying feeling the child&#39;s wild movements as they
sucked, drinking deep of the fresh, clean blood. Her
struggles began to ebb away, slowing, then reluctantly
both vampires pulled away while her breath still
caused her well developed chest to rise and fall
weakly.

&quot;I think we&#39;ll keep her,&quot; Amy said contentedly.

Dru nodded, &quot;That WAS fun.&quot; She leaned over the
unconscious, bloody girl and kissed Amy, mixing the
girl&#39;s blood between their mouths, tongues dueling.
Letting the child sleep they drew together, hands
tearing at clothes as they gave into animal passion.


&quot;I thought that Drusilla was nuts?&quot; the vampire
remarked, his long brown hair falling into his eyes.
There was a sense of age about him, even with his
youthful beauty, and a sinister aspect.

&quot;Don&#39;t let anyone else hear you say that, Scott,&quot; the
woman commented, the two striding down the dark alley
together.

&quot;Guess she doesn&#39;t like to be reminded,&quot; Scott noted.
He looked over at her, &quot;You&#39;ve been here longer than
most, Claire...?&quot;

Claire smiled wryly, her short black hair falling into
her eyes. She hadn&#39;t died all that long ago, and still
looked like your typical teenager, not a deathless
monster. &quot;Considering the Mistress sired me,&quot; she
shrugged, &quot;I guess I know more than most.&quot;

Scott paled, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean...&quot;

Claire waved it off, &quot;Never mind.&quot; She lead the way a
few moments, &quot;Truth was that m&#39;lady really was crazy,
and for years.&quot;

The taller man watched their surroundings warily,
wondering if any of the slayers might be lingering.
&quot;So what changed?&quot; he asked.

&quot;You know about how the Mistress got made, Alex?&quot;
Claire asked.

&quot;She was a pet project of a vampire named Angelus,&quot;
Alex recalled, &quot;he found out about her second sight
then set out to take everything away from her, break
her completely. Once he was done making her crazy, he
turned her.&quot;

&quot;So what changed?&quot; Scott asked.

&quot;Angelus died,&quot; Claire smiled grimly, &quot;and apparently
he had been exerting some kind of influence on her,
even after all these years. Once he was slain...&quot;

&quot;Dru regained her sanity?&quot; Scott sounded skeptical.

&quot;Not quite that simple,&quot; Claire said dryly.

&quot;It gave Amy an opening,&quot; Alex surprised them by
saying, &quot;and she managed to break through the
craziness.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Claire agreed, &quot;Amy had been a healer
before being turned by Willow and retained some of
those skills as a vamp.&quot;

&quot;So she managed to repair Dru and now she&#39;s second in
command,&quot; Scott sounded thoughtful, his expression
clearly calculating.

&quot;Don&#39;t underestimate Amy,&quot; Claire was deadly serious
as she continued, &quot;she&#39;s shared blood with the
Mistress as well as being very devious herself.&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Scott yielded.

&quot;I sort of wish Amy had shared that catch of hers
around,&quot; Alex rumbled mournfully.

&quot;She&#39;s in for one hell of a time,&quot; Claire murmured in
fond memory, touching her throat were fading scars
marked both sides of her throat. She shook herself as
she became business like, &quot;And we&#39;ve got our own
hunting to do.&quot;

&quot;Dibs on fresh meat,&quot; Scott said promptly.

&quot;Why did I KNOW you were going to say that?&quot; Alex
rolled his eyes.

&quot;You two are going to be the death of me,&quot; Claire
growled.</pre>
