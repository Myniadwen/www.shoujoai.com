Ororo Monroe sat by the window seat, gazing outside and not 
coincidentally at the road out there where their guest would be coming 
from. She was feeling nervous, an emotion that she rarely let her 
fellow members of the X-men see.

She got up for a moment, then sat right back down again, afraid of 
missing her. &#39;Them,&#39; she quickly corrected herself, &#39;not her.&#39; She 
shook her head mournfully, knowing that she was deluding herself. She 
was sitting here anxiously waiting for one person and one person only: 
Raven Darkholme, aka Mystique.

They had crossed swords several times over the years, but a more 
private meeting stubbornly remained in the front of Ororo&#39;s mind. 
Raven had arranged for them to meet in a gay bar, and Storm had been 
surprised by the crowd&#39;s reaction when she walked in.

Storm had been in her leather phase, and the admiring glances she 
received from the women in the crowd had generated a new, 
uncomfortable warmth inside her body. A warmth Raven seemed to find a 
great deal of enjoyment in fanning.

Raven had flirted with her, but more importantly, she had flirted 
back! Ororo still didn&#39;t fully understand what had possessed her as 
they had sat there, trading verbal barbs. Raven had shifted and 
changed her appearance, finally mirroring Ororo&#39;s own form, but in 
poses and postures she never would have tried.

&#39;I ran right out of there like a bat out of hell,&#39; Ororo thought with 
a weary sigh, &#39;and then right into the supposed safety of poor Forge&#39;s 
arms. What on Earth was I thinking?&#39; She gave another long sigh, and a 
faint but visible blush colored her cheeks as she thought, &#39;It&#39;s not 
like I hadn&#39;t been with a woman before.&#39;



Storm and the X-Men had been visiting Japan, to attend the wedding of 
Logan to his lady love, Mariko of the clan Yashada. The flight over 
was wonderful, and the reception that night was lovely. But then 
things started to go seriously wrong. The food they ate was poisoned 
by a rival of Mariko&#39;s for her clan&#39;s leadership, leaving only a 
weakened Storm, Wolverine and Rogue available to find out what was 
going on and who was responsible. Yuriko, an ally of Logan&#39;s joined 
Storm as she pursued leads on what had happened.

They had been in an alley together, confronted by a group of thugs 
looking for trouble. The battle was short and sweet, and at Yuriko&#39;s 
urgings she had cut loose, finally released the firm hold she had 
always retained on her emotions. And it felt wonderful!

Later, Yuriko looked over at the rain drenched X-Man with a wry smile 
on her handsome face. &quot;If you are going to run with me tonight,&quot; she 
said to her thoughtfully, &quot;you&#39;re going to have to look the part.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ororo asked her suspiciously.

&quot;Ororo, there&#39;s some places we&#39;re going to have to go to get the 
information we need, that you&#39;re going to stand out in like a sore 
thumb,&quot; Yuriko explained to her patiently, a little smile on her face. 
&quot;So a bit of disguise is in order,&quot; she finished.

Yuriko suddenly grinned at her dangerously, grabbed Ororo&#39;s arm, and 
with a laugh quickly pulled the protesting woman into a nearby leather 
shop.

A few minutes later they came out, and Ororo was transformed. Tight 
leather pants hugged her from waist to ankle, sliding into black 
leather boots, and her breasts were barely contained by a strapless 
leather top. A jacket over that completed the outfit.

Ororo turned and twisted, an odd smile on her beautiful face as her 
long mane of snow white hair flowed all around her. &quot;You know,&quot; she 
softly admitted, &quot;this is really quite comfortable. I could get used 
to this.&quot;

&quot;It does look pretty good on you,&quot; the much slimmer Asian woman said 
with a thoughtful nod. Frowning, she reached over and tugged on 
Ororo&#39;s long white hair, &quot;But I think some of the hair&#39;s got to go, to 
complete the look.

&quot;Is that really necessary?&quot; Ororo asked Yuriko softly, a frown on her 
face as well. She had grown out her hair since she was a child, and 
was reluctant to loose it.

Yuriko gazed at Ororo, and she felt as if the intense young woman was 
seeing beyond her body, maybe into her very soul itself. &quot;Haven&#39;t you 
ever wanted to just change yourself completely?&quot; she asked her softly. 
Yuriko added with a small smile, &quot;Hair grows back, but when will this 
kind of opportunity knock again?&quot;

Ororo gazed at her, wondering at the odd tone the woman was using. &#39;I 
don&#39;t even know her,&#39; she thought, &#39;but something makes me want to 
listen to her.&#39; A deep breath, a brave smile, and &quot;Let&#39;s go get it 
done, then.&quot;

Her heart sank low in her chest as the locks of white hair fell on the 
floor around her, and it was with a great deal of nervousness that she 
finally looked into the mirror to see what Yuriko had ordered the 
pretty young hairstylist to do. A bold white crest rose above her 
head, curving a bit, and a long tail snaked down her back. She looked 
both exotic and exiting, something Ororo wouldn&#39;t have normally though 
herself to be.

Yuriko looked at her, a faint flush on her pale cheeks. &quot;It looks 
great, Ororo,&quot; she said softly, reaching out to gently stroke along 
the bare side of her head, then up to feel the crest. The soft, 
delicate touch felt like sweet fire on the newly bare skin, and Ororo 
shuddered involuntarily, fighting to regain some of her control.

&quot;Where to next?&quot; Ororo asked her softly.

Yuriko seemed about to say something, then she visibly stopped 
herself. &quot;There&#39;s some bars on the docks we&#39;ll check first,&quot; she said 
softly, as they walked together down the street, soaking in the gazes 
of the admiring passerby.

The next few hours passed by in a blur, Yuriko and Ororo visiting club 
after club together, using either force or charm as needed to piece 
together their enemy&#39;s plans. After a few false leads they had 
gathered enough of the information to see the shape of the Silver 
Samurai and Viper&#39;s plans, and how to best go about stopping them.

&quot;Where are we going now?&quot; Ororo asked her companion a bit wearily. 
They went up a small flight of stairs to a door, which Yuriko unlocked 
to led her in. The apartment was tiny and bare, only the essentials 
there for the resident: a flat mattress on the floor, a pillow and a 
radio. The only decoration was a print hanging on one wall.

&quot;Grab a seat,&quot; Yuriko said calmly, taking a bottle of sake from the 
fridge. &quot;We&#39;ve got a bit of time before the Samurai and Viper move,&quot; 
she said as she retrieved two small cups, &quot;let&#39;s make the most of 
them.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ororo asked, and Yuriko turned to give her a 
considering look. She took a short step and was beside her, pushing 
Ororo back on the mat.

Yuriko kissed Ororo intensely, only breaking the kiss to say, &quot;I&#39;ve 
wanted to do that since before the haircut.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;ve never, and I barely know you&quot; Ororo started to stammer out, 
when Yuriko gently shushed her, a finger on her lips. She lay on top 
of her, gazing down into Ororo&#39;s bright blue eyes, seeking something 
in them, and finding it.

&quot;We may both die tomorrow,&quot; Yuriko said it calmly, without fear. &quot;The 
odds are against us, and we&#39;ve few allies we can rely on. So tonight,&quot; 
she said with a certain intensity, &quot;I want to be alive, to live life 
fully. Will you help me do that?&quot;

Ororo looked up into those dark eyes, and felt that same wildness she 
had discovered back in the alley. She wanted this, to release all of 
her control, so instead of answering with inadequate words, Ororo 
stretched up to kiss her back.



Storm smiled to herself, continuing to look outside. She had never 
told the X-Men what had happened to her that night. She rather 
suspected that Wolverine knew, but he was the sort of man not to 
intrude on another&#39;s privacy.

Kitty was shocked at Storm&#39;s new look, a reaction she really should 
have expected. It took them a while to return to their previous 
relationship, and things still weren&#39;t quite the same. Privately, 
Ororo suspected that Kitty had actually seen her mother figure as a 
sexual person for the first time, and that it had disturbed her 
greatly.

She and Yuriko had never repeated the experience. They had known it 
was a one time thing that neither of them could give up their own way 
of life for the other. She had to admit, she&#39;d been greatly tempted, 
though.

It really was one wild night!

Much later, the X-Men had faced a deadly trap, which ensnared a person 
in their own heart&#39;s desire. Storm was rather surprised that her&#39;s was 
Tokyo, and spending another wild night with Yuriko. She had resisted, 
but had barely escaped unscathed. &quot;The closest of calls,&quot; she had said 
to Logan later, &quot;the narrowest of escapes. I doubt I could do so 
again.&quot;

A jeep came around the corner, to pull into a gentle stop out front. 
Rogue got out, then Raven, and finally Rogue, quite gentlemanly, 
helped Kitty out. &#39;I guess it&#39;s time,&#39; Storm thought to herself with a 
little smile as she smoothly got up off the couch. Storm walked 
outside and down the steps to the jeep, smiling a bit at Raven.

&quot;It&#39;s been a long time,&quot; Storm said to her with a friendly smile on 
her face. </pre>
