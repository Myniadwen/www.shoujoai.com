<h1>Missing Wand</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<pre>&quot;Has anyone seen my wand?&quot; Hermione asked, looking under a stack of 
parchment.

&quot;No,&quot; Harry replied, looking up from his Potions essay.

&quot;You&#39;ve lost your wand? Blimey! You&#39;re the last person I&#39;d&#39;ve ever see 
misplacing a wand!&quot; Ron laughed.

&quot;Shut it and help me look.&quot;

The trio spent the next ten minutes searching the Gryffindor common 
room. Defeated, Harry and Ron returned to their seats while Hermione 
rechecked her pockets for the hundredth time. With a growl, she 
snatched up her bag and searched through it.

&quot;Relax, it&#39;ll show up,&quot; Ron said hopefully.

Ignoring him, Hermione continued searching for another five minutes 
until she too, sank into a nearby chair in defeat. It wasn&#39;t like her 
to lose something as important as her wand. Lately her mind seemed to 
be thoroughly preoccupied by an unexplained want. She didn&#39;t have a 
clue of what it was she seemed to want so she had tried to push it out 
of her head. It would always come back within a moment or so, stronger 
then it had been. It had become so distracting that she couldn&#39;t even 
concentrate on her homework anymore.

With a sigh, she glanced out of the nearest window, seeing Hagrid&#39;s 
cabin and the Forbidden Forest just beyond it. The sky was clear and 
the Saturday morning was welcoming but that didn&#39;t seem to matter to 
Hermione. The boys, who were stuck inside catching up on homework, 
stared anxiously out the window. Hoping Ron was right, Hermione 
gathered her bags and made for the door to leave.

&quot;Where you going?&quot; Ron asked desperately, secretly hoping she&#39;d help 
him with his essay.

&quot;To the library. I need to look up some work for Arthimancy,&quot; she said.

&quot;Well, have fun then,&quot; Harry smiled and returned to his Potions essay, 
though it was obvious he was staring at the window from the corner of 
his eye.

Ignoring Ron&#39;s protest before it even left his mouth, Hermione ducked 
through the entrance and disappeared from their sight. When she had 
turned a corridor, she broke into a run. Making to go to the library, 
she stopped dead in her tracks several corridors away. Ahead of her, a 
group of Slytherin girls were walking toward her. Though they hadn&#39;t 
noticed her as they laughed about something. In the lead of the group 
was Pansy Parkinson, who seemed to have been the one who cracked up the 
group. Just as Hermione was about to turn and head down a different 
corridor, Pansy spotted her.

&quot;Well now, look who it is! Hermione Gangreen!&quot; The girls around her 
burst into laughter again, Pansy&#39;s loud shrieking laughs, the highest.

&quot;Leave me be, Pansy. I&#39;m not in the mood for you,&quot; Hermione said with a 
growl.

&quot;What was that, Gangreen? I couldn&#39;t hear over your mudblood.&quot;

The girls shrieked again with laughter, which don&#39;t last long. Highly 
angered at being insulted with such a filthy name, Hermione had walked 
up to Pansy and slapped her hard. With an amazed look, Pansy quickly 
stopped laughing and held her now red and stinging cheek. She hadn&#39;t 
expected it and neither had Hermione, whose anger had quickly 
dissipated as she realized what she had done. Before either could 
speak, a voice made them all jump.

&quot;Granger! Assaulting my students. Fifty points from Gryffindor!&quot; Snape 
shouted walking toward them.

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Hermione gasped, her voice quivering slightly.

Running away from the them, Hermione began to cry.

***

The water felt cool against Hermione&#39;s red eyes. She had hid in the 
nearest girl&#39;s bathroom and cried for the best part of fifteen minutes. 
Now she was trying to wash away the evidence of her weakness, failing 
horribly for she couldn&#39;t stop shaking and her face was still red. Just 
as she had lowered her face to the sink and scooped up some more water, 
she heard the door open. Suddenly someone grabbed her hair from behind, 
pulling her backwards and then slamming her against the wall.

&quot;We meet again, Gangreen,&quot; Pansy laughed, holding Hermione&#39;s hair 
tightly with her right hand.

&quot;I said I was sorry!&quot; Hermione quickly said, pain shooting from the 
back of her head.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m aware but that&#39;s not what this is about.&quot;

&quot;What is it then?&quot; Hermione gulped, feeling powerless without her wand.

Hermione&#39;s voice caught in her throat as she felt Pansy&#39;s free hand 
slowly pulling up her robe. Then she could feel Pansy&#39;s fingers resting 
softly on her thigh before moving them up to her stomach. As much as 
she wished she could, the wild haired girl could not fight Pansy away. 
Maybe it was the heat of her hand, but it felt kinda nice.

&quot;When you slapped me earlier...&quot; Pansy&#39;s nails, felling as sharp as 
claws, raked against Hermione&#39;s bare stomach. &quot;...It turned me on...,&quot; 
The nails raked at her skin again. &quot;I really do like it when a girl 
gets rough with me.&quot;

Pansy was now whispering into Hermione&#39;s ear, an evil smirk on her 
lips. Wanting to cry because of the pain the nails caused when they 
raked her skin, Hermione bit her lip stubbornly. She refused to let 
Pansy see her cry and risk letting her win on some perverse level. 
Though she wished she had worn more then underwear under her robe as 
Pansy&#39;s nails raked painfully against the skin of her stomach again.

&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; The wild haired girl asked, a tinge of fear 
in her voice.

&quot;You, in a moment,&quot; Pansy replied, dragging Hermione into a stall for 
more privacy.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Hermione asked when the stall door was 
closed.

&quot;I see hanging around Weasley made you a bit thick in the head.&quot; Pasny 
shrieked with laughter. &quot;Anyway, I think I&#39;ll perfer to show you rather 
then explain.&quot;

Yanking at Hermione&#39;s hair, Pansy spun her around so the two could face 
each other. Pansy&#39;s nails raked themselves up Hermione&#39;s thigh as she 
pulled up the girl&#39;s robe again. Her fingers stopped at the top of 
Hermione&#39;s panties. With a defiant grin, she tore them off. Gasping, 
Hermione still made no move to stop what was happening, despite being 
in the position to do so. It was as if a small voice in the back of her 
mind told her it would be okay, this was what she had been wanting. Yet 
another voice screamed for her to fight. Hermione, however, opted to 
agree with the former of the voices.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna teach you not to ever embarrass me in front of my friends. 
At the same time, it appears I&#39;ll be teaching you a thing or two that 
you should know fully by now,&quot; Pansy whispered.

Hermione tried to open her mouth to speak but nothing came out. Before, 
Hermione could close her mouth, a sudden loud gasp escaped her. She 
could feel two of Pansy&#39;s fingers slamming into her vagina. It hurt 
very much due to fact that Pansy&#39;s sharp nails were scratching her 
vaginal walls everytime she pushed in. Tears began to form in 
Hermione&#39;s eyes from the pain, but she still couldn&#39;t make herself 
move. It was as if she was actually enjoying it as Pansy continued 
finger fucking her. She didn&#39;t want it to end, but it soon did.

Dazed at what had happened, Hermione realized she had been nipping at 
Pansy&#39;s neck. However, Pansy was smiling and didn&#39;t appear to be angry. 
Now Hermione could feel a third finger joining the first two in her 
vagina. Just as Pansy was began to thrust her fingers in and out again, 
she finally let go of Hermione&#39;s hair. Her now free hand crept up 
Hermione&#39;s robe and beneath her bra. Groaning in enjoyment, Hermione 
could feel herself happy as Pansy massaged her breasts.

The second orgasm that began to build within her was undoubtingly the 
biggest of the two. Pansy pinched Hermione&#39;s nipples roughly, causing 
her to cry out in pain. It wasn&#39;t long before Hermione&#39;s body finally 
spasmed and she let out a muffled groan. Once again, Hermione&#39;s mouth 
had found Pansy&#39;s neck without realizing it. She had a coppery taste in 
her mouth and realized she had bit so hard this time that she had drawn 
blood. Pulling away, her lips were covered by Pansy&#39;s mouth. It 
should&#39;ve been a rough kiss full of hate but it was soft. Hermione was 
overrun by a feeling of ease and calm. When Pansy pulled away, she just 
stared at her numbly. A small trail of blood was dripping down and 
disappearing beneath Pansy&#39;s robe.

&quot;Had I known you&#39;d enjoy it so much, I might have been a little 
gentler.&quot; Pansy had pulled her fingers out of Hermione and was licking 
them playfully. &quot;Such a naughty girl...&quot;

&quot;Had I know you&#39;d react like this because of a slap, I might&#39;ve slapped 
you sooner,&quot; Hermione caught herself saying.

Her face flushed red when realized what she had just said. Expecting 
Pansy to say something mean, she was shocked by Pansy gently brushing 
her fingers against her face.

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Granger. You might&#39;ve not had done it unless you&#39;d be 
in your normal state of mind.&quot;

&quot;How do you know?&quot;

Pansy didn&#39;t reply. Instead, she smiled and pulled her robe&#39;s neck over 
Hermione&#39;s bite. She opened the stall door to leave then stopped and 
reached into her pocket. &quot;Here,&quot; She said, pulling out a wand and 
tossing it at Hermione. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to risk you using it on me.&quot;

Hermione caught her wand and looked at Pansy with amazement. With a 
shriek of laughter, Pansy left the bathroom. It was awhile before 
Hermione moved from her slumped position against the stall&#39;s wall. Her 
robe fell down when moved, almost appearing to straighten its self. She 
grabbed her torn panties from the floor and stuffed the into her bag 
along with her wand.

***

Back in the Gryffindor common room, Hermione flopped into a chair and 
began her homework, a smile from ear to ear on her face.

&quot;Er, Hermione? What are you so happy about? Found a new book on 
Arthimancy or something?&quot; Ron asked, mournfully gazing up from his 
Transfiguration essay.

&quot;No. I&#39;m just happy because I found my wand, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Where was it?&quot; Harry asked, not looking up from his Charms essay.

&quot;In the library,&quot; Hermione replied, suppressing a giggle.</pre>
