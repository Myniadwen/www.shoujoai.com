<h1>Break Shadow (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/break-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Starfire hovered rather quietly in the center of her strange metal 
prison.  As she sat in the meditative lotus position, she murmured a 
soft chant.

&quot;Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos,&quot; she murmured over and over.  The 
meditating calmed her slightly, and she was grateful that Raven had 
imparted the knowledge to her.  However, the thought of Raven broke 
whatever tranquility she had acquired and Starfire let herself fall 
back to the ground again.  The young alien could not shake Chaos&#39; 
question from her mind.

&quot;Do I love Raven?&quot; Starfire asked herself aloud.  &quot;Certainly I love my 
friend.  What kind of friend would I be if I did not love my friend?&quot;  
She heaved a sigh.  &quot;But Chaos did not mean the love for a friend.  Do 
I love Raven as I would if she were my truest love?&quot;  She could not 
answer her own question.

Starfire looked up to the small silver sky above her, tears suddenly 
welling in her bright green eyes.  She wished desperately that somebody 
could just appear and help her decipher this blasted problem.  Raven 
was the foremost choice to help her in this issue.  She did not coddle 
the yet-innocent young woman like Robin did, nor did she lack the 
maturity that Cyborg and Beast Boy earnestly needed.

As Starfire sifted through the reasons why she wanted Raven there to 
help, she struck upon one fact that made her pause.  She wanted Raven 
there to help her and reassure her because under all the bravado and 
denial Raven put out, she was a pure hearted person.  She would help 
Starfire no matter what the circumstances, and not because she was a 
dutiful hero.  Raven cared deeply for Starfire, even if Starfire had 
not seen it before.

It was then that Starfire began to wonder why exactly Raven had been 
the forefront of her thoughts.  Robin was the one who was a master of 
deduction and finding ways out of traps.  She wondered why she wasn&#39;t 
exactly hoping and praying for Robin to appear, but for Raven to help 
her.  She closed her eyes to further her thinking and was suddenly 
graced with a vision of herself kissing Raven.

Her eyes snapped open in shock.  Starfire swallowed around a sudden 
lump in her throat, a blush burning her cheeks.  She was not disgusted 
by the idea of kissing her comrade.  In fact, she actually found 
it-pleasing?  Starfire blushed a deeper shade of red when she realized 
that she rather enjoyed the idea of kissing Raven.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Starfire murmured, putting her long fingers to her lips.  She 
put all of her thoughts to Raven and examined every little thing about 
the sorceress.  After a time, Starfire smiled her adorable smile.  She 
had found an answer to Chaos&#39; question.

----------

Raven suddenly stirred.  She brought her eyes back into focus and saw 
Chaos standing on the water below, staring up at her.  Raven&#39;s eyes 
flashed white as she pushed herself off of the roof, flying at Chaos 
with speed she never knew she had.

&quot;Are you here to kill me too?&quot; Raven snarled.  Chaos stared at her for 
a long moment before grinning.

&quot;I see your powers are finally unlocked,&quot; she chuckled.  &quot;Sixteen years 
and one traumatic death was all it took.&quot;  Chaos easily drew her sword 
in time to deflect the angry strike Raven lashed out with.  Raven&#39;s 
eyes were the gleaming white that signaled the summoning of her power, 
but she was doing something more than simple telekinesis.  The shadows 
had formed around her hands into what looked like a sword, and she 
stood in a stance similar to Chaos&#39;.

&quot;Good, Raven,&quot; Chaos laughed aloud.  &quot;I guess my teachings really did 
make a difference.  Now I&#39;ll finally have a real battle.  I hope you&#39;re 
a good opponent.&quot;  She closed her eyes and raised her sword before her, 
her grin fading into an expression of concentration.  Black fire 
gathered around her sword and her body until it erupted into a column 
of flame that reached far into the sky.  When the inferno calmed, Raven 
found herself staring at the rightful form of Hell&#39;s heir.

Chaos&#39; form was still humanoid, but obviously demonic.  Her eyes, 
narrow, glowing red diamonds, numbered six.  Her ears were pointed and 
folded back, and matched her terrible fangs.  Her hands and feet were 
clawed, and a prehensile, dagger-ended tail twitched around her legs.  
Wings with night black feathers completed the image of the daughter of 
Lucifer Morningstar.  Raven swallowed back the fear that suddenly rose 
in her heart.  Starfire&#39;s face flashed before her eyes and the fear 
turned to rage.

Back in the Tower, Robin, Cyborg, and Beast Boy ran to the nearest 
window when a sudden tremor shook the entire building.  A massive 
pillar of water exploded upwards from the bay as a shockwave created 
massive waves.  The three met on the roof, staring out to see what they 
could.  Cyborg&#39;s optic sensors zoomed in to where the water was falling 
back into the bay.

&quot;Whoa,&quot; he murmured softly at what he saw.  Robin produced high-powered 
binoculars and looked out through them.  As he fended off Beast Boy, he 
watched as the battle began to unfold.

Raven and Chaos swung their swords at each other with every ounce of 
strength they had.  They hovered over the water, ignoring the 
shockwaves that resulted from the sheer force of their strikes.  Chaos 
grinned madly, her laughter ringing out with the sound of magic against 
metal.  Raven harnessed the power that came from her rising anger, 
increasing the force of her blows and the speed at which she moved.

Chaos matched her strike for strike, almost a bit indolently.  She 
dodged an overhead swing and grabbed Raven&#39;s ankle with her tail.  With 
a mere twist, she flung the young woman through the sky towards the 
water.  Raven splashed into the water, sending another massive wave 
towards another shore.

&quot;You must be faster, Raven!&quot; Chaos shouted.  &quot;Show me the power that is 
supposed to rival mine or I&#39;ll send you to meet your dear Starfire!&quot;  
The water below her suddenly erupted upward and threatened to blind her 
with spray.  Chaos gestured and the water parted at her command.  Raven 
was revealed, her sword aimed for a killing strike.  Chaos smirked and 
dodged, Raven rising up a few more yards before diving back at the 
demon.

Chaos would have been a bit surprised if she didn&#39;t already know how 
the battle was going to end.  Raven, spurred on even more by the 
mention of Starfire, began to attack with staggering alacrity.  Chaos, 
more experienced in duels to the death, still dodged Raven&#39;s attacks, 
but was serious in her efforts.  In fact, she continued to smirk even 
as Raven landed slash after slash on her body.

Raven cried out in rage as she struck a heavy blow.  Chaos was thrown 
back through the air, crashing down and carving a path in a barren, 
rocky shore.    She stood up, however, black blood streaming from her 
wounds.  Though she could heal the wounds herself, Chaos did no such 
thing.  Instead, she sheathed her sword and cast her arms out.

&quot;End this battle, Raven!&quot; she ordered.  &quot;End it all!&quot;  Raven frowned 
and rushed through the air.  Chaos, on the ground, grinned slightly and 
twitched her hands.

----------

&quot;I hope you can hear me, Starfire.&quot;

Starfire looked up and about, utterly baffled as to where Chaos&#39; voice 
was coming from.

&quot;I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve got your answer.  I&#39;m going to free you in a 
moment.  Raven will be rushing to kill me, and then the prophecy will 
be done.  When the sphere breaks, I will be in front of you, just off a 
way from your tower on a rock-covered shore.  Raven will be there as 
well.&quot;

Starfire stood up and stared at the silver prison&#39;s walls.  Spider-web 
cracks suddenly appeared in the metal, and the young woman tensed to 
move.  When the orb of metal finally broke, Starfire was flying 
straight forwards at top speed.  She could see Raven standing on the 
rock-covered shore, a black figure lying at her feet.

&quot;RAVEN!&quot; she screamed.

----------

Raven slammed into Chaos.  Her sword stabbed through the demon&#39;s middle 
and Chaos smiled slightly.  As she stumbled backwards and fell to her 
back, Raven let the black magic dissipate.

&quot;One last thing,&quot; Chaos rasped, staring blankly at the sky.  &quot;One thing 
to make sure my presence only helped you.&quot;

&quot;RAVEN!&quot;  The sorceress turned at the scream of her name and was 
suddenly tackled.  Raven sat up with some difficulty, looking to see 
who exactly would throw their arms around her in a tight hug.  She 
paused, obviously wondering if she was seeing a spirit.

&quot;Are you injured?&quot; Starfire asked anxiously, her hands turning and 
twisting Raven about as she looked for injuries on the shorter young 
woman.  Raven, for once, did not automatically break free of the 
peculiar examination.  She was rather confused as to what was 
happening.

&quot;You are well!&quot; Starfire suddenly exclaimed with a massive smile.  
&quot;Wonderful!&quot;  She hugged Raven close in happiness.  Raven blinked, her 
mind still trying to sort through the events.

&quot;Raven!&quot; a familiar voice shouted.  Starfire stood up, lifting Raven to 
her feet and refusing to let the other girl go.  Robin and Cyborg leapt 
off of a green whale and rushed over to where the battle had ceased.  
Beast Boy turned back to his normal humanoid form and hurried over as 
well.  The boys froze when they saw Starfire.

&quot;Star?&quot; Robin murmured in shock.  &quot;But...we thought you were dead.&quot;  
Starfire shook her head, still not letting Raven leave her grasp.

&quot;I am well,&quot; she said.  &quot;You do not need to worry.&quot;  Raven turned to 
stare at the faintly twitching Chaos.

&quot;You didn&#39;t hurt her at all,&quot; Raven said quietly.  Chaos smirked, black 
demon blood sliding from her wounds and her mouth.

&quot;My will would have been death for this entire city,&quot; she mumbled.  
&quot;But my fate was to unlock your power.  But now that I&#39;m about to die, 
I&#39;m free from that fate.  Thanks.&quot;  Her smirk faded and her eyes 
closed.  The Teen Titans were silent for a time.  Chaos had gone into 
the battle meaning to die.  Thunder suddenly rumbled across the 
darkening sky.

&quot;I don&#39;t think the news said there would be rain,&quot; Cyborg said as he 
looked up at the black clouds.  White lightning and red lightning 
flashed across the clouds.  The bursts of electricity struck closer and 
closer to where the Titans stood and eventually crashed down almost 
next to them.

Once the light had faded, the Titans were greeted with a sight unlike 
any they had seen before.  Two men had appeared from the lightning, and 
it was plainly obvious that they were not human.  The man that appeared 
from the red lightning bore a striking resemblance to Chaos.  In truth, 
the only difference between the man and Chaos was the fact that the man 
was covered with scars.

The second man was angelic.  His white wings caped around his 
immaculate white clothing and his soft gold hair fluttered before his 
blue eyes.  Each man went to a separate person.  The angel strode to 
Raven, and the demon crouched down by Chaos&#39; body.

&quot;Well done, Raven,&quot; the demon said.  &quot;You&#39;ve killed my daughter.&quot;  
Raven, still amazed by Starfire&#39;s appearance, paled at the man&#39;s words.

&quot;Lucifer,&quot; she whispered in the silence.  &quot;I...don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;  
The demon, Lucifer Morningstar himself, only chuckled a bit.

&quot;You have done her a favor,&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;The way to escape destiny 
is to die.  Not only did you allow her to fulfill her fate, you let her 
escape it as well.&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;s dead,&quot; Raven protested.  Lucifer wagged his finger at the 
girl, smirking.  He took a feather from his wing and laid it on his 
daughter&#39;s forehead.  A moment later, the black blood on the ground 
began to recede into Chaos&#39; wounds.  Her skin healed into scars, and 
she began to look even more like her father.  Her eyes opened and she 
sat up.

&quot;Was I dead?&quot; she questioned.  Lucifer nodded in response and pulled 
Chaos to her feet.  The heir to Hell shook her head to clear her mind 
after her sudden death and looked about.  Her eyes fell upon the angel 
standing near Raven.

&quot;Gabriel,&quot; she said curtly.  &quot;First you make sure my first life is 
controlled by that damned prophecy.  Now what do you want?&quot;  Gabriel 
smiled at her and turned to Raven.

&quot;I&#39;m here to consecrate her,&quot; he gestured to the young woman.  &quot;Her 
power is finally unlocked, and Heaven has decreed that I place a 
release limiter on that power.&quot;  He took a feather from his wing and 
brushed it over the gem on Raven&#39;s forehead.  Her eyes closed as the 
holy magic took effect.  Her clothes suddenly faded from black to 
white, a sign of her new strength.

&quot;There,&quot; Gabriel murmured.  &quot;Use your powers well, Raven.&quot;  His body 
faded into white light and vanished.  Chaos suddenly tapped Raven on 
the shoulder.  Raven turned, still trapped in Starfire&#39;s arms, to look 
at the demon.  Chaos smirked and flicked Raven in the nose.  The 
sorceress jerked at the action, blinking more out of shock than pain.

&quot;Don&#39;t make me check on you,&quot; Chaos chuckled.  &quot;I do owe you for what 
happened, but you know my patience is less than excellent.  Don&#39;t lose 
what you have.&quot;  Lucifer vanished in a red light and Chaos flew off to 
the horizon and disappeared.

&quot;What did she mean?&quot; Starfire asked, turning Raven about to face the 
shorter girl.  &quot;What do you have that you could lose?&quot;  Raven stared at 
Starfire for the longest time, just watching her bright green eyes.  
She smiled at the alien girl and rose up into the air.

&quot;Someone important,&quot; Raven said.  She moved forward and kissed Starfire 
gently.  When she moved away, Starfire was smiling.  In fact, Starfire 
was beaming as she threw her arms around Raven once again.

&quot;Oh, this is wonderful!&quot; the red-haired girl giggled.  &quot;Now I know my 
feeling is the correct one!&quot;  When she didn&#39;t let Raven go, the team 
deciphered what Starfire meant.  The boys turned to leave, but Robin 
lingered for a moment.  He waited until Raven put her arms around 
Starfire and returned the embrace.  Robin smiled, turned, and walked 
away.
