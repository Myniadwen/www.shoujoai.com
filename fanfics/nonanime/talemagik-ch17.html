<h1>Kitty and Illyana: A Tale of Magik! (part 17 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>        &quot;Ms. Summers,&quot; Prof. Xavier smiled slightly, offering the young 
redhead his hand, &quot;it&#39;s good to meet you.&quot;

        &quot;Nice to see you, sir,&quot; Rachel smiled down at the wheelchair 
bound man with the oddest look on her pretty face.

        Kitty and Illyanna followed their future apprentice inside the 
mansion, watching with some amusement as the Professor tried to get over 
his shock. The resemblance between Rachel and a young Jean Gray was 
remarkable and something the Professor was clearly unprepared for.

        &quot;So what&#39;s the plan?&quot; Kitty asked, giving the Professor a chance 
to regain some control.

        &quot;We&#39;ll do a more complete scan with Cerebro first,&quot; Xavier said, 
&quot;then a deep telepathic scan.&quot; He smiled slightly up at Rachel, &quot;No 
offense meant, but I&#39;d feel more comfortable confirming your story for 
myself.&quot;

        &quot;Understandable,&quot; Rachel agreed.

        &quot;Kitty and I haven&#39;t tried the Danger Room in a while,&quot; Illyanna 
noted, &quot;would it be all right if we ran one of the training sessions 
while you do that?&quot;

        &quot;Oh sure,&quot; Rachel sighed jokingly, &quot;you two get to go have fun 
while I get pocked and prodded. Life&#39;s not fair.&quot;

        The Professor chuckled softly before saying to Illyanna, &quot;It 
should be all right.&quot;

        Kitty watched the two head towards his office, her expression 
more serious than her tone had been. &quot;You think he&#39;ll find something 
odd?&quot; she asked softly.

        &quot;No,&quot; Illyanna shook her head, &quot;Ray&#39;s the real deal.&quot; She paused 
a moment before adding, &quot;If that isn&#39;t scary enough on it&#39;s own.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Kitty agreed. She smiled as they fell into step walking 
to the Danger Room, &quot;So do you think we&#39;ll need an observer?&quot;

        &quot;Better safe than sorry,&quot; Illyanna agreed.

        A few moments later both Logan and Ororo stood in the control 
room, Kitty and Illyanna wearing the matching yellow and black team 
uniforms of the X-men in the Danger Room below. &quot;So what sort of session 
do you want, darlin&#39; ?&quot; Logan asked, the black haired warrior smiling 
slightly.

        &quot;Tough,&quot; Kitty flashed a smile, &quot;I&#39;m curious to see how well 
magic does up against all the Danger Room&#39;s weapons and traps.&quot;

        &quot;Are you certain, Kitten?&quot; Ororo added, the regal African woman 
looking worried.

        &quot;If something goes bad I can teleport us out,&quot; Illyanna offered, 
&quot;or Kitty can just phase.&quot; She gentled her tone a bit, &quot;Just trust us, 
okay?&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Ororo nodded.

        Keeping his voice down so that the others couldn&#39;t hear Logan 
said, &quot;They&#39;re growing up, &#39;Roro. Gotta accept it, or it&#39;ll get rough on 
you.&quot;

        &quot;You may be right, old friend,&quot; Ororo sighed.

        &quot;The scenario&#39;s ready,&quot; Logan had an impish grin on his face as 
he said, &quot;let&#39;s go.&quot;

        Before Kitty or Illyanna could say anything the floor dropped 
away, revealing a pit. Kitty chanted a few words even as Illyanna echoed 
her action, the two of them floating as Kitty said, &quot;That was playing 
dirty, I think I like it.&quot;

        Cables exploded to life around them, trying to tangle up the 
girls but Illyanna was ready. Soul Sword flaming she cut through them 
like paper, moving with grace and agility developed through her many 
swordsmanship classes.

        &quot;I thought that her sword only worked on Magical beings and 
artifacts,&quot; Ororo murmured, her eyes slightly wider than normal.

        &quot;Guess she figured out how to make it work normally,&quot; Logan 
noted, sucking on a cigar with a grin on his face.

        Even as Illyanna cut through the tentacles Kitty raised a disc 
shaped shield, parrying a burst of scarlet laser beams. Another soft 
word sent golden streams of power from her hand to destroy the 
projectors in a burst of fire.

        A section of wall slid aside, then a flight of missiles were 
spat out at them. Both women moved as one, Illyanna&#39;s spell exploding 
the rockets in midair, then Kitty&#39;s bold flew through the blast to 
freeze the launcher in a block of ice.

        &quot;Iceman couldn&#39;t have done it better,&quot; Ororo murmured.

        After about five more minutes of traps, weapons and even combat 
droids a slightly singed looking Kitty and Illyanna left the Danger 
Room, gratefully accepting a pair of towels tossed to them by the 
grinning Logan.

        &quot;Not bad,&quot; Logan said as she pulled on his cigar proudly, &quot;not 
bad at all.&quot;

        &quot;I was impressed,&quot; Ororo had to admit with a smile.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Illyanna grinned back at them, her arm protectively 
around Kitty&#39;s shoulders. She tilted her head to the side before 
admitting, &quot;That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve tried to make my blade solid 
during a battle, though.&quot;

        &quot;Part of why we wanted to try it in the Danger Room,&quot; Kitty 
nodded. She pushed her now messy hair out of her eyes, &quot;Not to mention I 
kind of missed it.&quot;

        Logan dropped his voice a bit as he said, &quot;I caught an awfully 
familiar scent on you two when you came in. This lady, she&#39;s...?&quot;

        Ororo raised an eyebrow, &quot;What?&quot;

        Kitty and Illyanna looked at each other a moment, silently 
communicating. Finally Illyanna gave the two of them a wry smile and 
said, &quot;It&#39;s a long story, and one that I&#39;m not sure we should be talking 
about, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

        Ororo frowned while Logan studied the two of them thoughtfully. 
&quot;I&#39;ll trust you two,&quot; he finally said, &quot;though as soon as you can tell, 
I want to know.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll tell you as soon as we can,&quot; Kitty agreed, looking oddly 
uncomfortable under Ororo&#39;s now stern gaze.

        Illyanna met Ororo&#39;s eyes and the intensity of them made her 
flinch slightly. &quot;You two mind breaking it up?&quot; Logan smiled at them 
wryly.

        &quot;No fighting, please,&quot; Kitty agreed.

        &quot;Besides it may not be necessary,&quot; the calm voice of Professor 
Xavier echoed in the hallway. They turned to see him rolling towards 
them, a smiling Rachel at his side.

        &quot;Goddess,&quot; Ororo murmured upon seeing Rachel, her face oddly 
pale.

        &quot;Damn,&quot; Logan muttered.

        &quot;Logan, Ororo,&quot; the Professor gestured to his female companion, 
&quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Rachel Summers. She&#39;s Kitty and Illyanna&#39;s 
apprentice visiting from the future.&quot;

        It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. &quot;I thought we weren&#39;t 
supposed to risk contaminating the timeline,&quot; Kitty muttered.

        &quot;My presence in the past already has contaminated the timeline,&quot; 
Rachel said reasonably, &quot;spilling the beans won&#39;t worsen it that much.&quot;

        &quot;Lovely,&quot; Illyanna muttered.

        Logan had the oddest look on his face. &quot;My nose doesn&#39;t normally 
lie,&quot; he finally said, &quot;but your scent....&quot;

        &quot;My mother is Madeline Pryor,&quot; Rachel took pity on him and said, 
&quot;she&#39;s a clone of Jean Gray, which explains my resemblance.&quot;

        &quot;So does she check out?&quot; Kitty asked the Professor quietly as 
the three talked.

        &quot;Both telepathically and by Cerebro,&quot; Professor Xavier said, 
&quot;she is whom she seems to be.&quot;

        &quot;Great,&quot; Illyanna smiled wryly, taking Kitty&#39;s hand as she 
watched them talking away, &quot;so what do we do now?&quot;

        &quot;That is something the three of you will have to decide,&quot; the 
Professor said.</pre>
