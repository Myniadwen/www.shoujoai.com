The Four Planes, and the Great Cataclysm

Earth, Fire, Wind, Water; the four elements of the planet. Mind, Body, 
Soul; the three elements of the body. Several more exist upon the Human 
world, Netherworld, Spiritual plane, and Demon plane. Two dimensions, 
holding two galaxies; one filled with a variety of human kind, another 
with a variety of demon kind with each holding a spiritual plane for 
collected spirits departing from the worlds. The Human world held the 
spiritual world, holding positive spirits, while the Nether world 
received the Demon plane, which held negative spirits. All for planes 
were forced to hold a constant balance in order to keep the structure of 
time and space in existence. A tilt of balance in any location could 
result in any sort of catastrophic cataclysm, from a minor change in 
winds, to the destruction of a planet, always dependent upon the 
discrepancy.

A long time ago, a very powerful demon attempted to enter the existence 
of the Human world, and succeeded. With a demonic aura powerful enough 
to open a rift from the Netherworld into the Human world, the 
disproportion of spirit and demon energy was enough to banish the world 
of Demons from existence entirely. All demon spirits were sent to the 
Demon plane, which resulted in another catastrophic imbalance between 
the Demon plane and Spiritual plane. With negative energy completely 
dominating over positive energy, the Spiritual world was in desperate 
need of positive souls. Ironically enough, the tyrant that had started 
the event that was later known as the Great Cataclysm started his 
adventures in the new dimension by conquering the planet he had landed 
upon, and completely destroying its inhabitance; a planet filled with 
many souls, and strong mages of both dark and light arts, a planet once 
called the planet of shadows, Azarath.

Not much was recorded about the Great Cataclysm, though some believed 
the powerful demon to have been a God of sorts, who had judged that the 
sorcery and dark arts of the people of Azarath to be evil. Others 
thought it to be the work of an evil creation, brought from the darkest, 
deepest parts of space, with its first target the planet at the end of 
the universe, and simply continue its way until it reached the center of 
the galaxy. The demon&#39;s reign continued for what many came to believe 
was far too long. The demon gained in strength by creating followers to 
do his bidding, following any and all commands delivered by the tyrant, 
furthering his hold over the Human world. These groups, or Cults if you 
will were gifted by the demon lord with a small portion of his powers, 
with each cult holding a different portion of special abilities, all of 
which held the powerful elements of the spiritual and demon worlds, 
though mostly leaned toward the darker elements, some of which were 
completely unknown to even the wisest of the human world.

Different races throughout the galaxy of the Human world were brought 
together to form a resistance against the demon and fought against his 
powerful control over neighboring planets. Countless battles were 
brought forth, with many lives lost. In the end, balance was created 
throughout the three planes, and the demon was sent away to the furthest 
part of the Demon plane, his soul to forever remain in a dormant state. 
In prevention from such catastrophes from happening again, the spiritual 
world gifted the wisest of the human world with special abilities, one 
of which was to foresee partial events of the future. These special 
people dubbed Prophets of the Human World shared their visions with each 
other, creating prophecies in prevention or preparation of such events 
as the Great Cataclysm. Prophecies were passed along from planet to 
planet, some varying from prophecies to legends, or simple fairy tales 
while others were collected into a book of stories, passed down from 
prophet to prophet. With the three remaining planes back into balance, 
and slightly more prepared for such events in the future, it seemed 
balance would hold itself until another disaster would find itself into 
one of the three planes.
