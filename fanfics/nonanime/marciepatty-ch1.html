<h1>Marcie and Patty (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Walking out into the large open field she smiled happily as the birds 
flew overhead and the warm sun shone down upon the landscape. The entire 
school week had been long and tedious, and her baseball game Thursday 
had been called on account of rain. But today, Sunday, she was free of 
school, free of teachers and D- grades, free of everything. She closed 
her eyes, her nostrils widening as she breathed in the great outdoors. 
Opening them once again, she lay back on the softly trimmed grass of the 
baseball field she was in and lazily began watching the clouds drift by. 
Soon, her eyes closed halfway, then all the way as she began snoring.

&quot;Sir? Wake up sir.&quot;

Peppermint Patty&#39;s eyes opened with a shock as she realized she&#39;d fallen 
asleep. Looking quickly around, she saw Marcie staring down at her, an 
amused smile gracing her face. Her best friend sat down next to her, 
pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose with the tip of her finger 
as she did so.

&quot;What are you doing, sir?&quot; she asked, studying Patty&#39;s freckled face, 
&quot;Why are you sleeping out here in a baseball field?&quot;

&quot;Stop calling me sir,&quot; Patty said, more out of habit by this point than 
any actual annoyance, &quot;I was just watching the clouds roll by and kind 
of drifted off I guess,&quot; she answered with a shrug.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Marcie muttered. She then lay down next to Patty, the two friends 
now both lying side by side as they observed the large white cumulous 
floating overhead.

&quot;That one looks a bit like a bird.&quot; Marcy said, breaking the silence.

&quot;Which one?&quot;

&quot;That one there,&quot; she answered, pointing up with her index finger.

Peppermint Patty looked in the direction Marcie was pointing and 
squinted, &quot;Oh yeah... I think I can see it.&quot;

&quot;Sorry about the game sir,&quot; Marcie said, &quot;I heard about Thursday.&quot;

Patty smirked, &quot;Meh, things like that happen sometimes. Although if it 
wasn&#39;t for the stupid rain we would&#39;ve clobbered them and everybody 
knows it.&quot;

&quot;If you say so sir,&quot; she answered. Once again, both let the silence 
envelop them as the clouds drifted high above and a warm breeze blew 
over them. &quot;Sir,&quot; Marcie finally said, &quot;Have you seen Charlie Brown 
around lately?&quot;

Patty&#39;s mood changed a bit as she let out a small sigh. &quot;Good ol&#39; 
Chuck,&quot; she whispered wistfully, &quot;Remember the fun times we all used to 
have Marcie?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re only in Junior High sir. Aren&#39;t you a bit young to be feeling 
sentimental?&quot;

Patty shook her head, &quot;Don&#39;t be silly Marcie, you&#39;re never too young to 
look back at the good old days. Remember that time we were all in that 
river race at summer camp? Or all the times we clobbered Chuck and his 
team during baseball season?&quot;

&quot;Or how about how, for the longest time, you didn&#39;t realize that &quot;the 
funny looking kid with the big nose&quot; was Charley Brown&#39;s dog Snoopy?&quot; 
Marcy asked, sending both girls into a laughing fit.

&quot;Seriously though,&quot; Patty finally answered after she stopped laughing, 
&quot;I haven&#39;t seen Chuck in a while, not since he started dating that 
redheaded girl from his class.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Marcie whispered, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Patty took a deep breath, &quot;Nah, it&#39;s okay. We&#39;ve all sort of started 
drifting off though, haven&#39;t we? Linus doesn&#39;t hang out as much now that 
he&#39;s finally started dating Sally, and of course ever since Lucille and 
Schroeder became inseparable...&quot; her voice drifted off a bit as she 
brushed a few stray brown bangs from her hair, &quot;I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be 
too surprised about Chuck and the red haired girl though, should I?&quot;

Marcie looked over at her friend, &quot;Sir?&quot;

&quot;Well, let&#39;s face facts Marcie; I&#39;m not exactly classically pretty, am 
I? I&#39;m a tomboy with freckles who plays baseball better than most of the 
boys on my team, and that redhead wears lipstick and dresses and just 
looks and acts the part of a girl better than I can,&quot; she said sadly as 
a cloud looking very much like a whale came between the two girls and 
the sun, &quot;I guess I&#39;m not the kind of girl who gets asked out, or sent 
flowers from admirers, you know?&quot;

Marcie didn&#39;t answer; she was too fixed on the tone of melancholy 
resignation in her friend&#39;s voice. Silently, she got up and walked away, 
leaving Peppermint Patty alone once more with the grass beneath her and 
the clouds above.

&quot;We&#39;ve all sort of started drifting off,&quot; Patty repeated, her whispered 
words drifting off with the breeze. She was about to get up and head for 
home, when a hand holding a small group of wild flowers plucked from 
behind the dugout came into view.

&quot;For you, sir.&quot;

Patty&#39;s eyes quizzically drifted from the hand clutching the flowers up 
the arm to Marcie&#39;s face. &quot;Marcie, wha...&quot; she was cut off as, without 
warning, her best friend gently kissed her on the lips.

Peppermint Patty&#39;s eyes widened in shock and disbelief; the kiss was 
little more than two lips touching and lasted only for the briefest of 
seconds, yet for the tomboy time seemed to briefly stand still. As their 
lips separated, Marcie couldn&#39;t help but smile at her friend&#39;s reaction 
as she tenderly placed the flowers in Patty&#39;s hand and lay back down 
next to her.

&quot;You know, sir,&quot; she said as the whale cloud now moved out of the way, 
once more allowing the sun to shine down on both her and Patty, &quot;I&#39;ve 
wanted to do that for years now, ever since we were younger.&quot;

Patty was at a loss for words. As everything around them once more 
seemed to drift off into a silent calm, she looked once more at the 
handful of wildflowers as the breeze blew their delicate scents her way. 
She lightly touched her lips where her friend had just kissed her, in 
her mind she could still feel Marcie&#39;s soft lips barely brushing against 
hers. Turning her head, she saw her friend silently looking up at the 
sky next to her. She knew her childhood friend well enough to see the 
signs of nervousness behind the seeming calm.

Finally, after several more minutes of tense quiet passed between the 
two, Patty reached out and took Marcie&#39;s hand in hers.

&quot;You&#39;re weird, Marcie,&quot; she finally said as she interwove her fingers 
with those of her friend, &quot;But in a good way.&quot;

Marcie looked over at her, a wide smile gracing her pretty face, 
&quot;Thanks, sir.&quot;

They both gazed at one another happily, Marcie admiring Patty&#39;s 
freckles, goofy-looking grin and tomboyish looks while Patty couldn&#39;t 
help but wonder why she&#39;d never noticed how cute her friend was behind 
her glasses. Finally, hand in hand, they looked back up, turning their 
attention back to the clouds.

-End-

Note: After seeing spoofs of Marcie and Peppermint Patty on both Robot 
Chicken and The Family Guy, I just thought it might be interesting to 
actually try to write a little fluff piece about the two. Also, the 
&quot;Lucille&quot; part wasn&#39;t a typo; Peppermint Patty often referred to Lucy as 
Lucille (in fact she was the only character who did so). Let me know 
what you think.</pre>
