<a href="../nonanime/starcross-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Starfire heaved a heavy sigh, closing her eyes and laying her forehead 
against her knees.  Soft footsteps sounded on the dirt and loose pebbles 
behind her.

&quot;So...BB told me you and Raven are hooked up now,&quot; Terra murmured.  
Starfire looked up to the blond girl standing beside her, unsure of what 
to make of the new Titan&#39;s small smile.

&quot;It&#39;s cool,&quot; the earthmover said without haste, rocking back and forth 
on her feet.  &quot;I think you and Raven are kind of cute together.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, friend Terra,&quot; Starfire replied, her voice unusually 
melancholy.  Terra frowned and sat down next to her teammate.  She laid 
a tentative hand on Starfire&#39;s shoulder, patting the older girl 
comfortingly.

&quot;He also told me about the whole demon thing that went on while I was 
training myself,&quot; Terra explained.  &quot;How you actually saw Lucifer 
Morningstar and Gabriel and all that.  And what about Chaos?  Man, she&#39;s 
scary.&quot;

&quot;She killed my sister Blackfire,&quot; Starfire muttered.  Terra nodded, her 
small frown returning.

&quot;I know,&quot; she said.  &quot;Beast Boy said that&#39;s why you&#39;ve been out here and 
why Raven seems unhappy again.  She did that because Blackfire was about 
to attack you and Raven.  I guess I can&#39;t really understand the whole 
thing, but maybe Chaos was just doing what you couldn&#39;t.&quot;  Starfire 
turned to gaze confusedly at the blue-eyed girl beside her.

&quot;Maybe Chaos just thought that Blackfire wouldn&#39;t give up,&quot; Terra said, 
trying to explain.  &quot;That Blackfire really wanted something bad to 
happen to you, you know?  And maybe, in her weird way, she was just 
making sure that Blackfire wouldn&#39;t try to hurt you and Raven anymore.&quot;  
She sighed and picked up a small stone, firing it across the water with 
a short burst of her powers.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;I guess that doesn&#39;t really make sense at all.&quot; 
 Starfire shook her head, picking up a stone and rolling it in her hand.

&quot;I understand,&quot; she said softly.  &quot;I just wish that my sister had not 
gone to such lengths to exact revenge.  I wish I knew why she had 
changed so much from when I left my planet.&quot;

&quot;People change a lot,&quot; Terra remarked.  &quot;Even when you kind of hope 
they&#39;d stay just the way they are, they&#39;re like a different person every 
time you see them.&quot;  She stood up and brushed the dust from her pants.  
&quot;You should come back into the tower.  Everyone wants you to cheer up.  
It&#39;s no fun around here when you&#39;re depressed, Starfire.&quot;  Starfire 
considered this and nodded, standing up with her smile beginning to 
return.

As the two returned to Titan&#39;s Tower, they were greeted cheerfully from 
the rest of the team.  Starfire seemed to take in their happiness, her 
smile increasing moment by moment.  When she saw Raven, she smiled her 
best smile and launched herself at the dark-haired sorceress.  Terra 
sidled up next to Robin with a sly smirk.

&quot;You said you&#39;d tell me if I got her back in here,&quot; she whispered 
through her teeth.  &quot;So?&quot;

&quot;Beast Boy is ticklish on his left foot, his stomach, and behind his 
ears,&quot; Robin replied.  Terra squealed in glee at the information and 
leapt at the green-furred boy.  Soon, the Tower was filled with its 
usual laughter.
