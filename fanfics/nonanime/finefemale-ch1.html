<h1>Elseworld's Finest Females: Supergirl and Batgirl (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Gotham Snow

Princess Diana, the heroine called Wonder Woman smiled slightly as she 
saw the first few flakes of snow, the black haired woman tilting her 
head up as the flakes settled on the golden eagle on her chest, the red 
shirt and blue pants that ended in boots almost styled after the Greek 
god Hermes.

Dressed in blue Supergirl descended, her red cape, boots and symbol the 
only bright colors on her costume. Her smile was still a touch sad but 
the blonde haired young woman was slowly getting over her sorrow, in no 
small part to her friendship with Batgirl.

&#39;I just wish she had found a better person to do it,&#39; Diana mused, then 
forcefully banished that thought. To be honest she still bore a grudge 
over the banishing of superhumans from Gotham City and her defeating the 
Justice Society, not to mention her treatment of the team when they 
visited a few months back.

&quot;Lost in thought?&quot; Supergirl asked, smiling up at her warmly.

Diana shook herself, the two of them heading towards the golden domes of 
the Justice Society headquarters. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I was just 
thinking it&#39;s good to see you smiling again, Kara.&quot;

Holding on to the edge of her cape Kara Zor-El smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;m trying 
not to let things bring me down as much.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad the news hounds have stopped trying to chase you,&quot; Diana noted 
wryly as they passed through the first security gate. After Luthor&#39;s 
arrest the press had hounded Supergirl, trying to get her to confess 
some deep dark secret between her and Lex, but in truth their 
relationship had been quite innocent.

Kara chuckled softly as they passed Firestorm talking to Black Canary, 
&quot;Being able to fly away from them helps.&quot;

They entered the monitor room, where their civilian aide Tim Drake 
listened and watched for possible alerts. &quot;All quiet tonight,&quot; the black 
haired teen hacker reported cheerfully, &quot;and from what chatter I can get 
from Gotham it&#39;s quiet there too.&quot;

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Big Barda muttered as the tall New God lounged against the 
wall quietly talking to her husband.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tim chuckled, &quot;I like the idea of Batgirl out in the snow, 
freezing her buns off fighting crime on Christmas.&quot;

Diana shook her head as Kara pressed her lips together, restraining 
herself. &quot;Too bad,&quot; Kara noted dryly, &quot;I was thinking of asking Batgirl 
if she wanted to join the Society.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; both Barda, Interceptor and Tim Drake blurted at the same time.

&quot;Tell me you&#39;re joking,&quot; Interceptor winced, the brown haired woman 
shaking her head, her red and gold costume clearly inspired by Wonder 
Woman&#39;s..

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that without asking,&quot; Kara reassured them, her blue eyes 
just a bit wounded for her friend. She put her hand on Diana&#39;s arm, &quot;You 
know, I don&#39;t think I want to stick around for the dinner. I should go 
say my hellos and leave.&quot;

The monitor room was silent as Kara walked off, the four of them 
unwilling to meet each other&#39;s eyes. &quot;I started it,&quot; Barda conceded 
after a moment, &quot;I should go apologize.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Diana sighed, &quot;Kara would know you&#39;re being insincere.&quot;

Interceptor winced, knowing that line was directed at her as well. &quot;What 
does Supergirl see in her?&quot; she wondered a little bitterly.

Surprisingly Tim answered that question, &quot;A hero. Once a lot darker than 
you all are, without powers of her own who has had to build herself into 
the toughest bad-ass on the planet.&quot; Everyone looked at him in surprise 
and Tim shrugged, &quot;I may not like her, but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t 
admire her in a way.&quot;

Meanwhile Kara made the rounds, respectfully offering her greetings to 
Abin, joking with Ambush Bug and Tarantula, chatting with Dr. Midnight 
and being her usual friendly self. Flash raced by, the slickly red 
armored figure stopping on a dime as he said, &quot;The snow&#39;s really coming 
down now!&quot;

As the Justice Society members raced to the windows to watch Kara took 
the opportunity to slip away, soaring off into the twilight away from 
Metropolis, her adopted home. Gotham City wasn&#39;t too far away physically 
from Metropolis, but in some ways it was a world away. As Supergirl 
soared over the city she felt the Oracle drones scan her, sending data 
back to their mistress as she dropped into an alley and changed at super 
speed.

In her newly adopted civilian identity of Kara Lee the blonde haired 
woman strode out of the alley in a loose sweater and jeans, nearly the 
opposite of Supergirl&#39;s usual garb, and headed down the street to her 
latest part time job as a reporter.

Meanwhile, Batgirl descended on the roof of the police department, 
summoned by the Bat-signal lighting up the sky. Silently the lightly 
armored woman landed, stalking up to the figure waiting until she calmly 
asked, &quot;Commissioner, you wanted to see me?&quot;

Sarah Essen turned, offering a steaming mug as the redheaded older woman 
said, &quot;Merry Christmas, Batgirl.&quot;

Batgirl took the mug reluctantly, hiding her discomfort around the other 
woman. Sarah Essen had at one time been her father&#39;s partner, and if 
what she read in his diary was true had even been his lover for a while. 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she answered, &quot;no trouble then?&quot;

&quot;All quiet, thanks to you,&quot; Sarah answered, studying Batgirl 
thoughtfully, &quot;if you keep this up, you&#39;ll put us out of a job.&quot;

Batgirl drank her coco, &quot;No, I need you to deal with the purse snatching 
and prostitutes.&quot; Calmly handing back the cup she stalked to the edge of 
the roof, &quot;Next time you use the signal for a non-emergency, I&#39;ll break 
it.&quot;

&quot;Cold bitch,&quot; Sarah muttered as Batgirl disappeared.

Batgirl&#39;s voice drifted up from the shadows, &quot;I have to be.&quot;

On the street the Batmobile waited, a black wedge shaped craft several 
generations ahead of anything else on the road. The roof retracted as 
Batgirl dropped down, then slid back into place as she secured herself 
in the seat.

Bruce Wayne&#39;s amused face appeared on one of the monitors as the black 
haired man said, &quot;So was I right?&quot;

&quot;False alarm,&quot; Batgirl agreed as she raced off through the snow, 
&quot;apparently Essen wanted to share a drink with me.&quot;

&quot;And you were an asshole,&quot; Bruce nodded, &quot;as usual.&quot;

&quot;Was there a reason you called me?&quot; Batgirl asked after a moment.

&quot;The Oracle system spotted Supergirl flying in,&quot; Bruce reported 
needlessly, knowing Batgirl had her own Oracle link in the car and in 
her suit, &quot;do you need to do anything about it?&quot;

Batgirl tensed a bit, a slight smile teasing her lips. &quot;I&#39;ll see her,&quot; 
she answered after a moment, &quot;but I think out of costume.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you invite her over for dinner?&quot; Bruce offered after a 
moment. He smiled, &quot;Alfred always makes too much now that Mom and Dad 
retired.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t even think about it,&quot; Batgirl said dryly as she raced across the 
city to the back-up cave hidden beneath the convention center.

Not long afterward Barbara Gordon, redheaded novelist and philanthropist 
emerged from one of the city&#39;s many office towers, making her way up the 
street confidently in a simple but stylish looking pantsuit. Checking 
the Oracle interface on her watch Babs noted that Kara was in a nearby 
caf&eacute;, and hurried to meet her.

Kara looked up from making her coffee as Babs entered, her smile of 
welcome nearly blinding. As Barbara reached her side she smiled, &quot;You 
didn&#39;t have to hurry over and see me, I was going to look you up later.&quot;

Babs actually felt herself blush, something she never did. She covered 
by ordering her own coffee, then the two headed for a corner table. &quot;We 
need to get you a better disguise,&quot; she noted lamely once they sat down, 
&quot;anyone could recognize you.&quot;

Kara leaned forward with a smile, &quot;But no one seems to. You know why?&quot;

Babs felt her normally cool reserve melting as it always did around 
Supergirl, &quot;Why?&quot;

Kara waved excitedly, &quot;No one thinks I have a secret identity. I don&#39;t 
wear a mask or anything else, so they just assume that Kara Lee is a 
look alike...&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Babs took a drink of her coffee, &quot;but there&#39;s not many people 
who look as beautiful as Supergirl does.&quot; She heard herself say the 
words and her eyes widened a bit even as she schooled her expression to 
calmness, &#39;I can&#39;t believe I said that!&#39;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Supergirl responded with a warm smile.

&#39;Bruce wonders why I let her into Gotham, even covertly,&#39; Babs mused, 
&#39;and I don&#39;t know if I could explain it to him.&#39; She smiles as they 
talked and thought, &#39;She brings out a side of me I haven&#39;t even admitted 
I had since my parents&#39; death...&#39;

Babs looked at Kara in concern as something occurred to her, &quot;Why are 
you here on Christmas eve?&quot; A wry smile, &quot;Even as a amazon I&#39;m sure 
Wonder Woman is planning something at JSA headquarters.&quot;

Shyly Kara looked away, &quot;I didn&#39;t feel like it this year.&quot;

Babs felt a surge of fear unlike any she had faced in the field as she 
quietly asked, &quot;Would you like to come to dinner with me?&quot;

Kara hesitated, &quot;You sure?&quot;

Babs gently squeezed Karen&#39;s hand, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Karen smiled brightly, &quot;Then I&#39;d love to.&quot;

To be continued...?

Notes: While the comic isn&#39;t THAT subtexty, EF is very much focused on 
the developing friendship between Babs and Kara. Much like Superman and 
Batman they come from completely opposite places as heroes, yet 
surprisingly get along well.</pre>
