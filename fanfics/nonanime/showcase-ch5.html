<h1>DC Universe 2045: Showcase (part 5 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/showcase-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        Night had fallen across the city as the older man walked into 
the upper floor office, his short black hair swept back from his face. 
He moved with an athletic grace as he walked across the floor, taking 
off his black suit coat to hang it up by his desk.

        &quot;You can come out now,&quot; the man said without turning around, &quot;I 
know you&#39;re in here.&quot;

        After a moment he stepped out of the shadows, a long black cape 
fluttering around him. A black mask hid his eyes, and a blue bodysuit 
fit him snugly. Another slight smile was on his face as Nightwing said, 
&quot;Hello Dick.&quot;

        Dick Grayson smiled slightly as the younger man stood in front 
of the window, looking out at the city of Bludhaven. &#39;He reminds me of 
Bruce,&#39; Dick noted. He sat down behind his desk and tilted his head to 
the side, &quot;You here for business or pleasure?&quot;

        &quot;Bit of both,&quot; Nightwing said as he took the mask off, revealing 
the blue eyes that the white lenses normally concealed. Tim Drake walked 
over to a seat across the desk from Dick, tilted his head to the side 
and asked, &quot;Has the Fortress breakout been a problem here?&quot;

        &quot;Our resident hero seems to be handling it quite well,&quot; Dick had 
an impish smile on his face as he sat back comfortably.

        &quot;Manhunter,&quot; Tim nodded slightly.

        The red and black garbed hero had appeared in Bludhaven shortly 
before Dick had officially retired from being Nightwing. Wearing the 
steel mask and carrying a high-tech battlestaff he or she appeared to be 
connected to the android Manhunters, but whoever it was he played it 
straight. While collecting bounties he didn&#39;t cross the line, only using 
necessary force.

        &quot;You still don&#39;t know who it is, do you?&quot; Dick asked with a 
smile.

        Tim Drake shook his head, &quot;No, not yet.&quot; He smiled, &quot;I suspect 
that Oracle knows, but I haven&#39;t asked her, it doesn&#39;t seem fair.&quot;

        &quot;Not telling,&quot; Dick said dryly. He rubbed at his blue eyes 
tiredly, &quot;I had a little visit from Richard Wayne recently.&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Tim sat up in surprise.

        &quot;He was paying a courtesy call, letting me know that he was 
reactivating the Outsiders,&quot; Dick informed him.

        &quot;You gave him your blessing?&quot; Tim asked.

        &quot;He didn&#39;t really ask,&quot; Dick said calmly, &quot;but yeah, I did.&quot;

        Tim nodded thoughtfully, &quot;I&#39;m not too surprised.&quot; At Dick&#39;s 
questioning look he elaborated, &quot;Both you and Batman weren&#39;t entirely 
thrilled with the JLA, even back when you were members. I don&#39;t expect 
that to change now.&quot;

        &quot;Sitting around waiting for the badguys to pop up never struck 
me as being the best idea,&quot; Dick answered calmly.

        &quot;He&#39;s an unknown,&quot; Tim said with a frown.

        Dick shrugged slightly, &quot;He&#39;s also a Wayne, more or less. Under 
the circumstances I&#39;m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.&quot;

        Tim hesitated for a moment, then changed he subject by quietly 
asking, &quot;Have you talked to Helena lately?&quot;

        Dick closed his eyes, &quot;No.&quot;

        Tim sighed. &quot;She&#39;d like to get to know you, I think,&quot; he said.

        &quot;I wasn&#39;t a very good father to Nightstar,&quot; Dick Grayson said 
grimly, &quot;I doubt I&#39;ll be a very good grandfather to Helena.&quot;

        Tim gave him a thoughtful look. &quot;You&#39;ve worked hard, becoming 
the chief of police in Bludhaven, getting on the city council, winning 
the race to be Mayor,&quot; he said.

        &quot;And you think I did it all to avoid my Granddaughter?&quot; Dick 
challenged.

        &quot;Did you?&quot; Tim asked.

        Dick didn&#39;t answer, getting up to walk over to the window, 
taking a turn to look out over the city. &quot;I had mixed feelings when I 
first moved to the &#39;Haven,&quot; Dick said, &quot;but the place has become my 
home. A home I&#39;ve been determined to clean up.&quot;

        &quot;And you&#39;ve done a hell of a job Mr. Mayor,&quot; Tim answered 
quietly, &quot;at the cost of anything resembling a personal life.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve never been very good at it,&quot; Dick said with a sigh, &quot;you 
just have to ask Kory. Or Babs. Or even Clancy.&quot;

        &quot;Nice attempt to get away from the issue,&quot; Tim murmured.

        Dick flashed a smile, &quot;Years back you would have chased every 
red herring I gave you.&quot; More seriously he said, &quot;I dumped her with Babs 
and Dinah because I just couldn&#39;t face it. Not with both Kory and 
Nightstar gone, I just couldn&#39;t handle it.&quot;

        &quot;And now?&quot; Tim pressed.

        &quot;I&#39;ve been out of her life for years,&quot; Dick said, &quot;she doesn&#39;t 
need me for everything.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe not,&quot; Tim agreed softly, &quot;but maybe you need her.&quot;

        Dick nodded slightly, but otherwise didn&#39;t reply verbally. 
Instead he decided to ask, &quot;So how are your Titans going?&quot;

        Tim accepted the change of topic, brightening as he said, 
&quot;Pretty well, actually. Conner&#39;s agreed to join, and we&#39;ve already got a 
senior advisor.&quot;

        &quot;Conner Kent,&quot; Dick noted, &quot;is he still calling himself 
Eradicator?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Tim nodded, &quot;I think he sees it as a way of getting out 
from Superman&#39;s shadow. And with his powers shifting to energy wielding 
it fits.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Dick admitted. He smiled, &quot;So who&#39;s your senior 
advisor?&quot;

        &quot;Mitch Shelly,&quot; Tim smiled, &quot;the Resurrection Man. He&#39;s got the 
experience, and his powers seems to have stopped his aging.&quot;

        &quot;He made a good Outsider way back when,&quot; Dick agreed. He frowned 
worriedly and asked, &quot;Has Fury signed on?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah, she has,&quot; Tim nodded. He shrugged at the look on Dick&#39;s 
face, &quot;I know she&#39;s been out on the edge for awhile, but her mother&#39;s 
murder hit her hard. I&#39;m hoping that the Titans can help her find her 
center once again.&quot;

        &quot;Good luck,&quot; Dick sighed, &quot;you&#39;ll need it.&quot; He looked curious, 
&quot;I&#39;ve heard Azrael has joined?&quot;

        &quot;The avenging angel, yeah,&quot; Tim sighed, &quot;she&#39;s just a bit 
creepy, to be honest. Arsenal looks like she&#39;ll be a solid member, and 
Impulse...&quot; He trailed off.

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Dick raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;He reminds me a bit too much of Bart,&quot; Tim quietly admitted and 
both he and Dick shared a laugh at that. They talked for awhile then Tim 
got up from his chair, &quot;I&#39;d better get going.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks for stopping in,&quot; Dick shook his hand.

        &quot;Talk to Helena,&quot; Tim reminded him before disappearing into the 
shadows.

        Dick Grayson walked over to the window, looking out at the 
darkness of the city. He turned and walked over to the desk, picking up 
the phone. Not giving himself time to think about it he dialed, 
listening to it ring nervously.

        &quot;Hello?&quot; Dinah Lance answered.

        &quot;Dinah,&quot; he said nervously, &quot;it&#39;s Dick. Is Helena home?&quot;

        &quot;She&#39;s out with her girlfriend,&quot; Dinah said, clearly amused.

        &quot;Girlfriend?&quot; Dick blinked in surprise.</pre>
