<pre>      &quot;Aren&#39;t we a little old for this?&quot; the catgirl asked,
reaching up to adjust the black ears she was wearing
nervously. Kitty Pryde looked good in the simple one
piece leotard, black stockings and elbow length gloves
completing the outfit.

      &quot;You&#39;re never too old for costume parties,&quot; Rachel
said firmly, her own black leather outfit clinging to
the redhead&#39;s slim form. The dominatrix outfit was
just barely decent, mostly consisting of black
panties, a corset and a lot of leather straps.

      &quot;Who are you going as,&quot; Kitty sounded just a bit
envious, &quot;the Black Queen?&quot;

      Rachel just smirked, &quot;Why not? My mom wore the
costume, once.&quot;

      &#39;Right before she went Dark Phoenix on us,&#39; Kitty
thought but kept her mouth shut. &quot;So what party are we
going to?&quot; she asked as they strode down the New York
street together.

      &quot;We could always crash the Hellfire Club one,&quot; Rachel
joked.

      &quot;Don&#39;t even think about it,&quot; Kitty shuddered, &quot;I
don&#39;t even want to consider the sort of things they&#39;d
be up to on Halloween.&quot;

      &quot;There&#39;s a few clubs in Mutant Town we could hit,&quot;
Rachel relented, &quot;it sounds like it&#39;d be more your
speed.&quot;

      Kitty gave Rachel a look, &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve
actually visited the Hellfire Club recently? They&#39;re
our mortal enemies, remember?&quot;

      &quot;Even with Roberto as a member?&quot; Rachel challenged.

      &quot;A point,&quot; Kitty acknowledged. She frowned slightly,
&quot;I just get nervous going in there, especially when I
remember when Emma captured me.&quot;

      Rachel shrugged slightly, &quot;Which just goes to show
that people and things can change, considering that
Emma Frost is an X-Man now.&quot;

      Kitty and Rachel dodged a group of costumed revelers,
most wearing Avengers costumes, but a few daring to be
dressed in mutant themed outfits. &quot;Something you
weren&#39;t very happy about,&quot; Kitty noted, &quot;though I
notice that&#39;s changed.&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be friends with her,&quot; Rachel
shrugged, &quot;but I have to accept reality. She&#39;s here
and in a relationship with Scott, if I like it or
not.&quot;

      &quot;Still, it can&#39;t be fun,&quot; Kitty reached out to gently
squeeze Rachel&#39;s hand.

      &quot;So, Hellfire or...?&quot; Rachel asked.

      Kitty took a deep breath then, knowing it was
probably going to be a mistake, said, &quot;Let&#39;s live
dangerously, the Hellfire Club.&quot;

      &quot;You won&#39;t regret it,&quot; Rachel laughed, keeping hold
of her hand and gently tugging her along through the
evening crowds.

      Before they knew it, Kitty and Rachel had reached the
Hellfire Club, a ornate building in the center of New
York. The young woman at the door was dressed in a
fetish maid outfit, glossy black rubber hugging her
slim form as the blonde said, &quot;Welcome Miss Summers,
Pryde.&quot;

      Kitty felt nervous as they entered, feeling a bit
better at the fact the main floors were done up in a
fairly normal style for Halloween. Orange and brown
banners and drapes, skulls and ghosts, all the typical
decorations for the season were scattered around the
massive room.

      The costumes people were wearing were all a bit more
extreme, of course. There were a certain number of
historical outfits, from turn of the century on back,
while darker fantasy figures mingled. Elegant vampires
prowled for blood, beautiful demons tempted the soul
and ethereal spirits drifted together across the dance
floor.

      &quot;Let&#39;s get a drink,&quot; Rachel said, leading the way up
to the bar.

      &quot;Right,&quot; Kitty agreed as she warily scanned the
crowd.

      Rachel elbowed her way through the waiting customers
with long practice, Kitty right behind her. She
ordered their drinks then looked back at the visibly
tense Kitty, &quot;Relax! They aren&#39;t going to try anything
openly.&quot;

      &quot;Don&#39;t be so sure,&quot; Kitty answered.

      Rachel collected their drinks then passed one to
Kitty. &quot;See anyone you know?&quot; she asked, taking a look
as she took a gulp of her beer.

      &quot;Lady Deathstrike is here,&quot; Kitty noted the samurai
standing not too far away. She looked thoughtful,
&quot;Wonder if Viper and the Silver Samurai are around?&quot;

      &quot;Viper&#39;s associated with the club,&quot; Rachel noted,
&quot;but I think Harada is tied up with clan Yashada
business.&quot; She waited for Kitty to answer only to
realize that the other girl was dead silent, standing
there stiffly as she saw a certain figure in the
crowd.

      &quot;Courtney,&quot; Kitty breathed out, her eyes narrowing.

      The platinum blonde cut through the crowd easily, her
outfit nearly a fetishist dream. Her body was sheathed
in white, glossy material that looked like it had been
painted on. &quot;Hullo, Kitten,&quot; Courtney Ross purred,
smiling at both of them.

      &quot;You do not get to call me Kitten, Ms. Ross,&quot; Kitty
said stiffly, ignoring the clearly amused smile on the
older woman&#39;s face.

      &quot;It&#39;s been a long time,&quot; Rachel said, trying not to
move protectively between the older woman and Kitty.
It surprised her, that protective instinct, but she
didn&#39;t question the emotion.

      &quot;I&#39;m hurt,&quot; Courtney said, reaching out to touch
Kitty&#39;s cheek, &quot;considering how close we were, once
upon a time.&quot; She turned gracefully, &quot;Oh well, I hope
you have a nice time.&quot;

      Rachel let Courtney move off before she turned to
Kitty, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Kitty reassured her, &quot;I still don&#39;t quite
get what she wanted, tho.&quot;

      &quot;We came here to party,&quot; Rachel decided it might be
best to change the subject, &quot;so let&#39;s go.&quot;

      There was dancing, wine and good company, and Kitty
and Rachel threw themselves into the celebration with
a passion. Despite sticking close together they danced
with both men and women, many of whom seemed
interested in more than friendly company. Still they
returned to each other, taking a moment to catch their
breaths at one of the side tables.

      &quot;Your hotness must be rubbing off on me,&quot; Kitty
sighed happily, &quot;I actually got propositioned a few
times out there.&quot;

      &quot;Or maybe it was your own hotness,&quot; Rachel teased.
She looked towards the stairs as she added, &quot;I hear
the real party is upstairs. Do you want to take a look
before we go?&quot;

      Hearing the eagerness in Rachel&#39;s voice Kitty gave in
gracefully, the two of them winding through the crowd
to head upstairs. The plush carpet absorbed their
footsteps, the beautifully decorated hall nearly
silent as they walked, moving through the smaller
group of people up there.

      As they passed one door it opened silently, a young
man moving up behind Rachel to press a small device to
her neck. A soft hiss of releasing chemicals and the
redhead slumped, the man catching her smoothly before
quickly pulling her into the room and shutting the
door.

      The lights winked out, leaving the hall in gloom even
as people called out in alarm. &quot;Rachel?&quot; Kitty asked,
looking around intently.

      &quot;Here,&quot; the redhead appeared from the crowd, moving
to catch up. &quot;Sorry, I got caught up back there,&quot; she
said, her black leather choker gleaming in the dim
light. She looked around, &quot;Let&#39;s duck into one of the
rooms, at least until the power comes back on.&quot;

      &quot;But shouldn&#39;t we try to leave,&quot; Kitty started to say
as she followed Rachel into the room.

      Rachel pushed the door shut then surprised Kitty by
pressing her mouth to Kitty&#39;s in a hot kiss. Kitty
stiffened in surprise as Rachel&#39;s tongue touched her
lips, her full figure pressing tightly to hers in the
near darkness of the small room.

      &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do this for such a long time,&quot; Rachel
gently kissed her neck, licking to taste the salt on
her skin.

      Kitty could feel her knees getting weak, her breath
coming fast as Rachel reached up to stroke her breasts
through the thin cloth of her costume. &quot;No,&quot; she
whimpered softly, &quot;Rachel, we can&#39;t!&quot;

      &quot;Shh,&quot; Rachel purred as she bent down to take a
breast in her mouth, sucking on gently. Nipping
delicately through cloth she surprised gasps from
Kitty, switching from mound to mound hungrily. Her
hand slipped down Kitty&#39;s belly to the v of her
thighs, chuckling as she felt the wetness.

      Kitty opened her mouth to protest only to moan as
Rachel dropped to her knees, pressing her mouth to the
mound that was wetly revealed beneath her tight
leotard. She couldn&#39;t seem to catch her breath as
Rachel flicked out her tongue to taste there, then
kissed more forcefully as hands tugged her clothes
down.

      &quot;So excited,&quot; Rachel sighed happily as she ardently
kissed that bare flash, bringing another choked gasp
from Kitty. With surprising skill her tongue and lips
worked on the reddened flesh, intent on achieving one
thing only.

      &quot;Ahh!&quot; with a cry Kitty came, orgasming against
Rachel&#39;s hungry mouth. Again and again those devilish
lips and tongue brought her off, until finally Kitty&#39;s
strength completely failed her and she slumped to the
floor.

      &quot;Sleep well Kitten,&quot; Rachel rose to look down at her
fondly, &quot;we&#39;ll be doing this again soon enough.&quot; With
that she strode away, leaving the room as Kitty looked
on in dazed confusion.

      Kitty lay there for a few moments, trying to get her
thoughts in order, then on legs like rubber she pulled
herself to her feet. &#39;Why did Ray just leave like
that?&#39; she thought dazedly.

      &lt;&lt;Kitty!&gt;&gt; Rachel&#39;s voice called out in her mind.
Before she could form a response the door was slammed
open,. a clearly furious looking Rachel Summers stood
in the doorway... oddly dressed in a white costume
just like Courtney had worn earlier.

      &quot;Wha&#39;?&quot; Kitty managed weakly.

      &quot;That bitch,&quot; Rachel growled as she rushed forward,
gently holding Kitty up even as she helped her get her
clothes back in order. &quot;They drugged me,&quot; she bit out
angrily, &quot;I&#39;ve been out cold for the last half-hour.&quot;

      &quot;Then who...?&quot; Kitty said even as the pieces fell
into place with a sickening thud. &quot;Courtney.&quot;

      In a upper floor room of the Hellfire Club Courtney
Ross watched Kitty and Rachel soar off into the night,
Rachel holding Kitty in her arms. &#39;I&#39;m glad I knew
about this psionics-shielded room,&#39; she thought as she
pulled off the red wig, removing the choker off that
disguised her voice, &#39;or the young Marvel Girl would
be taking me apart.&#39;

      Courtney smiled as she licked her lips in
satisfaction, &quot;The Kitten&#39;s cream was as sweet as I
hoped... now I just have to see if she comes back for
more.&quot;

The End?

Notes: Courtney Ross and Kitty first met in early
issues of Excalibur, but things didn&#39;t get interesting
until Courtney took Kitty under her wing when the team
was MIA. There were a great deal of &quot;subtexty&quot; moments
between them and a clear sense that Ms. Ross was
trying to turn Kitty to the dark side, but that story
was largely abandoned when the original writer left.</pre>
