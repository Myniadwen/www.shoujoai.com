I was finished. The monster triumphed. Dropped down on top of me. Dug 
its claws in my shoulders. It hurt. Even through the dress. The monster 
spread its wings. Flapped them. Higher. Up into the darkness. Couldn&#39;t 
see the ground.

It screamed. Awful scream. It let go. The air was heavy. The ground was 
hard. Sound of bones breaking. Or wood. I couldn&#39;t feel my legs. 
Couldn&#39;t feel anything. Numb.

Splintered chairs and tables. Everywhere. I crawled blindly through the 
badlands. There had to be rescue somewhere. The monster grabbed onto my 
leg. Defeated. Couldn&#39;t do anything. It dragged me back through the 
waste. Lifted me.

The second fall was worse. My shoulder. I couldn&#39;t move. Only wait. Wait 
for it to sit down on me. It held onto my shoulders again. The dress 
couldn&#39;t keep out the pain. Tears.

The monster flapped its wings. Brought me higher and higher. Over the 
rooftops. I could see him. His silhouette. He had his back turned on me. 
He didn&#39;t more. Why didn&#39;t he help? The fall. It was too far. I would 
die. Didn&#39;t he need me anymore? Had he found someone else? He didn&#39;t do 
anything.

It let go. I rushed toward the ground. The world was spinning. I 
relaxed. There was no reason to survive. I wanted him to feel bad. Feel 
terrible about letting me go. Maybe then...

The softest of clothes and skin. Bliss. The darkness let go. I was 
staring into her eyes. Lost. The girl had caught me. I was useful after 
all. I smiled. Stuck my tongue out at the monster high above. It dived. 
Screaming.

Just as it was about to attack. She stepped aside. The ground burst 
open. Something white emerged. High into the air. A worm. A bright worm. 
It bit the lizard&#39;s head right off. Headless corpse trashed the 
remaining chairs.

It lay still. The worm. My worm. The one I drew. It had saved me. 
Something was moving inside. I wanted to touch it, but she wouldn&#39;t let 
me. She shook her head. Walked away. The rusty iron ground made noises 
in the night.

Back at the restaurant something white gained size. Swollen. The worm 
had eaten the monster and grown. It exploded with a faint sound. White 
skin on the road. The new born screamed. Just around the corner.

The hospital. The girl held me closer. It was a miracle she could carry 
me. The man in the hospital. He had shot me. Wanted to hurt us. I hugged 
her.

A door. The hospital gate. She concentrated to disguise us. The gate was 
opened. It was the girl&#39;s dad. He looked troubled. And determined. I 
wondered who was helping him. Except for the key I hadn&#39;t done much. 
Maybe the worm had helped him?

He ran. Up the fire stairs. The new born rounded the corner. A bee. Or a 
moth. Light. Almost glowing. Not the butterfly I had intended. It glared 
at us. Spread its wings. Flew up. Up to the rooftop. Up to the girl&#39;s 
dad. It didn&#39;t look nice at all. Why did he make it like that?

They fought up there. He shot it. But it wouldn&#39;t die. It stabbed him. 
Hurt him. Over and over again. Her tears wetted my face. She couldn&#39;t be 
with him anymore. Never again. But he was still her dad. She told me.

She moved on. The knife could do it for sure. But if he saw us. The 
woman. She would find us. She&#39;d kill the girl. We couldn&#39;t let him see 
her. More tears. So much sadness. He had betrayed us. And now the girl&#39;s 
dad would die. No sense. Nothing at all.
