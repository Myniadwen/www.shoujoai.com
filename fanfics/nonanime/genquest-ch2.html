<h1>The Genesis Quest (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/genquest-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Gambit moved gracefully across the rooftop, his purple and black light 
armored costume barely making a sound as the thief cat-walked his way 
along. His brown overcoat swirled a bit in the soft breeze, the many 
hidden pockets weighed down by throwing blades and other such items.

Quietly the brown haired, thin figure reached the side of the building, 
then balancing carefully on the edge of the roof he drew forth a small 
device. Leaning over the side to a waiting window he studied a small box 
that was built into the wall, then clipped on two wires from his device. 
A press of a button and he tensed up, waiting for a possible alarm, then 
relaxed once he saw things were still quiet.

It had been a few months since he had left the X-men, but Gambit had 
kept himself busy. Reverting to old habits Remy had redefined himself as 
a Robin Hood like figure, hitting the crime families then passing on 
much of the profits to the disadvantaged. Of course it was dangerous 
work, but he had to admit he loved the thrill of the jobs too.

Carefully Gambit slid the window open, then swung his body off of the 
roof and onto the room as silently as a cat. Looking around the dimly 
lit room he made his way stealthily to the door and out into a hallway. 
Drawing on the map he had memorized Remy made his way to the office on 
the second floor, easing the door open...

&quot;You&#39;re late,&quot; the voice sounded amused as the lights came on.

&#39;How did they sneak up on me?&#39; was Gambit&#39;s first thought as he rapidly 
took in the two figures standing nearby. In the front was a tall, brown 
skinned man, muscles rippling beneath a combat vest loaded with ammo, a 
cannon over his shoulder along with a sword and a mysterious looking 
side arm. Beside him was a pale looking young lady with black hair, 
oddly dressed in black lace and frills, reminding him of someone from 
another era.

&quot;Sorry, my friends, I didn&#39;t realize I had a appointment,&quot; Gambit smiled 
charmingly, trying to maintain a casual attitude.

&quot;I had calculated you&#39;d reach here in under a minute,&quot; the tall black 
man noted, &quot;you disappoint me.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you should have told him that, Ninja,&quot; the young lady noted with 
barely restrained amusement.

&quot;So,&quot; Gambit studied them both warily as he asked, &quot;you knew that I was 
coming here, Mr. Ninja?&quot;

&quot;Hollowpoint Ninja,&quot; he corrected flatly. &quot;We were able to calculate 
this was your most likely target, yes,&quot; he agreed. He looked to his 
partner, &quot;Gothic Lolita?&quot;

&quot;Smashing and bashing duty calls,&quot; Gothic Lolita smiled as the pale 
woman moved with inhuman speed and grabbed at Gambit.

With his usual grace Gambit tried to break free of her grip but was 
shocked at the power in her hold on his upper arm. &#39;She&#39;s super strong,&#39; 
he realized, debating using his kinetic charging ability on her.

&quot;Good night,&quot; Gambit never even saw the blow from Hollowpoint Ninja that 
knocked him out.

&quot;Awww,&quot; Gothic Lolita sighed as he collapsed to the ground, &quot;I wanted to 
play with him some more.&quot;

&quot;Entertain yourself later,&quot; Hollowpoint Ninja said flatly as he picked 
up Gambit, &quot;we have a job to do.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Gothic Lolita conceded as they silently made their way out 
of the Advanced Ideas Manufacturing safe house.

A reddish brown haired young woman stuck her head out the window of the 
waiting jeep and called, &quot;He was late, wasn&#39;t he?&quot;

&quot;Correct, Stem Cell,&quot; Hollowpoint Ninja agreed as he walked over to the 
vehicle, Gambit casually slung over his shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;ll contact the boss,&quot; Stem Cell cheerfully said as she picked up the 
covertly modified cellphone. Dialing the number quickly she waited for 
the pickup then reported, &quot;Ma&#39;am? Our objective has been obtained.&quot;

&quot;I wonder if Social Butterfly and Cornfed are finished their mission 
too?&quot; Gothic Lolita asked as she climbed in the back seat, taking Gambit 
from Hollowpoint Ninja and laying him out in the back of the jeep.

&quot;We haven&#39;t heard from them on internal communicators,&quot; Hollowpoint 
Ninja noted as he got in the passenger side, &quot;therefore they&#39;re probably 
still working.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re on our way,&quot; Stem Cell nodded as she hung up. &quot;Okay,&quot; she started 
up the engine, &quot;we&#39;re off.&quot;

&quot;Where to?&quot; Gothic Lolita asked her as she stuck her head up between the 
front seats, her twin pigtails looking oddly cute.

&quot;Deliver Gambit to our boss&#39; local base,&quot; Stem Cell said simply, &quot;then 
we&#39;ll be finished our obligation to her for helping repair the team.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Hollowpoint Ninja nodded slightly.

Stem Cell drove efficiently, but she couldn&#39;t help looking at her 
teammates fondly.

Just a short time ago Stem Cell and her comrades had been badly damaged, 
a nearly non-functioning team of androids called Livewires. Assembled 
from nanotechnology by SHIELD they had been tasked with finding and 
shutting down black projects, covertly funded operations developing 
illegal technology for terrorist groups. In what nearly became a suicide 
run they took on a modified SHIELD hellicarrier along with a army of 
Hydra Life Model Decoys, a battle that slaughtered the team. Only Stem 
Cell had been left alive after that, and had been faced with the 
seemingly impossible task of rebuilding her comrades.

&#39;Which is when Genesis contacted me,&#39; Stem Cell thought.

Using technology that was incredibly advanced even to the tech savvy 
Stem Cell the woman calling herself Genesis had regenerated the 
Livewires, them with Stem Cell&#39;s assistance had uploaded their damaged 
memory files. Her cost for restoring them seemed small enough, too, 
collecting a former X-Man as well as one other thing.

The jeep bumped as they made their way into the small town, passing by 
the traditional corner store, small bank and other small town touches. 
&quot;This almost looks like a bad Norman Rockwell painting.&quot; Gothic Lolita 
noted.

&quot;I don&#39;t like it,&quot; Hollowpoint Ninja noted as a child raced across the 
street to follow a bouncing ball.

&quot;Social said they&#39;re at Victoria and Baker,&quot; Stem Cell said as they 
turned onto Victoria street, cruising past seemingly prosaic homes.

BOOM!

&quot;Step on it,&quot; Gothic said firmly as a explosion went off just ahead.

Stem Cell floored them the jeep accelerating forward with a little jump. 
The fire up ahead lit up the sky, smoke pouring out of the home of 
Victoria and Baker. As they squealled to a stop Hollowpoint Ninja leapt 
out, scanning their surroundings.

&quot;Are they...?&quot; Stem Cell asked as she got out, Gothic Lolita following.

The front door blew out and three figures emerged, two smoking quite 
badly as their artificial flesh burned. Social Butterfly was a blonde, 
today, with a slim build and sexy eyes, dressed in a torn jumpsuit while 
Cornfed was his usual tall, bulky form with light brown hair and a oddly 
folksy attitude.

&quot;Status?&quot; Hollowpoint Ninja demanded as he searched for possible enemy 
forces.

&quot;We&#39;re fine,&quot; Social Butterfly smiled sweetly, &quot;just a bit singed.&quot;

&quot;Who did it?&quot; Stem Cell demanded.

&quot;Dunno,&quot; Cornfed said as he hauled the woman over to the waiting jeep, 
&quot;but the target&#39;s fine too.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Gothic Lolita nodded. She tilted her head to the side in a 
questioning way, &quot;Stick around to see who did this, or bolt?&quot;

&quot;Unknown enemy with undisclosed capabilities,&quot; Hollowpoint Ninja noted, 
&quot;it would be tactically unsound to stay.&quot;

Stem Cell nodded, &quot;Everyone in the jeep, we&#39;re moving out.&quot;

&quot;Ninja, can you ramp up your sensors?&quot; Cornfed asked as they piled into 
the jeep, &quot;Might give us some early warning.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Hollowpoint Ninja nodded.

&quot;Little tight in here,&quot; Social Butterfly complained good naturedly as 
she, Gothic and Cornfed climbed in, their two guests slung into the rear 
storage bay.

&quot;We&#39;ll be out of this soon,&quot; Stem Cell promised as they raced off in a 
squeal of tires. &#39;But why does Genesis want Gambit,&#39; she looked back 
towards their dusky skinned captive, &#39;and the supervillain Frenzy?&#39;

To be continued...

Notes: Livewires was a six issue miniseries by Adam Warren featuring 
robotic heroes fighting black projects. Very cool book, strongly 
recommended.</pre>
