<h1>Azkaban (part 5 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/azkaban-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Dinner that night was a fairly enjoyable affair by Alicia&#146;s accounting.

Tom the innkeeper put three of the tables together in the parlor, and the
seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious
courses.

As for Alicia? She ate surely enough, but still she seemed a little
preoccupied.

Thoughts of Black kept coming back to her over and over again.

&#145;I&#146;m a Raven.&#146; she thought to herself, &#145;Isn&#146;t it my duty as a Raven to
hunt down these sort of people? I feel like I&#146;m neglecting my duties by
ignoring this Black fellow. Still---&#146;

&#147;How&#146;re we getting to King&#146;s Cross tomorrow, Dad?&#148; Fred asked, rousing
Alicia out of her deep thoughts and back to the conversations going on
around her. They were presently eating chocolate pudding, which was quite
good as a matter of fact. At Fred&#146;s questioning everyone looked up at Mr.
Weasley, who seemed to turn abit red around the ears at the attention.

&#147;The Ministry&#146;s providing a couple of cars,&#148; he said simply, but that
only seemed to fuel everyone&#146;s curiosity. &#147;Why?&#148; Percy asked.

&#147;It&#146;s because of you, Perce.&#148; George replied with an almost too good to
be believed serious expression on his face. &#147;And there&#146;ll be little flags
on the hoods, with HB on them---&#148;

&#147;---for Humongous Bighead,&#148; said Fred, concluding George&#146;s &#147;witty&#148;
remark. Everyone it seemed, except for Percy (of course) and Mrs. Weasley
snorted into their puddings. Oh, Alicia didn&#146;t do it either but moreso
from the fact that she found Fred/George to be rather dry witted for her
taste.

&#147;Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?&#148; Percy asked again, in a
rather dignified voice.

&#147;Well, as we haven&#146;t got one anymore, and as I work there, they&#146;re doing
me a favor---&#148;

His voice seemed rather casual, but his thoughts said differently. All of
a sudden it was as if he was thinking up of everything possible to occupy
his mind with. The uppermost &#147;level&#148; of thoughts suddenly became rather
cluttered with needless (and a few personal) thoughts. Alicia quickly
decided not to peer anymore at his top thoughts since some of those
thoughts were rather private memories of him and Mrs. Weasley -- nuff
said&#146;.

&#147;Anyway it&#146;s a good thing, too,&#148; Mrs. Weasley remarked briskly, &#147;Do you
realize how much luggage you&#146;ve all got between you? A nice sight you&#146;d
be on the Muggle Underground--- You are all packed, aren&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;Ron hasn&#146;t put all his new things in his trunk yet,&#148; said Percy, in a
long-suffering voice. &#147;He&#146;s dumped them on my bed.&#148;

&#147;And I have to go give Ron and Hermione the books I got them.&#148; Alicia
added.

&#147;You&#146;d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won&#146;t have much time
in the morning,&#148; Mrs. Weasley called down the table at Ron, who was now
scowling rather fiercely at Percy.

As dinner broke up Alicia went to gather the books and give them out. As
everyone made their way one by one upstairs to their rooms, Alicia felt a
slight chill run down her spine. She stopped, and thought for a second,
&#147;-- nothing --&#148;

Sure enough as she did a quick &#147;touchy-feely&#148; of all things around her
with a brief sweep of her powers she found nothing out of the ordinary.
Everything was where it should have been, yet still she felt as if
something dreadful passed near her mind&#146;s eye. Something in the distance,
yet close all the same. Nothing. One more check and once again she came
up blank. &#147;Must be nerves.&#148;

It was, however, just as she was putting Ron and Hermione&#146;s books
together to deliver, that&#146;s when she heard the ruckus coming from
Ron/Percy&#146;s room. As she walked towards the door she passed Harry
(heading downstairs) as she entered. &#147;What&#146;s all the ruckus about.&#148;

&#147;My Head Boy badge is gone!&#148; Percy growled, looking quite frustrated as
he stormed about the room looking for his &#147;precious&#148; badge in such a
dreadful state. Alicia could only shrug in a slight bit of sympathy to
Ron&#146;s plight (who was also looking though not as enthusiastically) as she
tossed his books onto his bed and motioned to them, &#147;Your books I got
you. It&#146;s all there---&#148; (almost immediately Percy looked under the books
as if the badge had suddenly taken refuge beneath them, before turning
his attention back to other parts of the room that he already searched a
few times over) &#147;---oh-kay. I&#146;ll be going now.&#148;

&#147;Did you see Fred &amp; George?&#148; Ron suddenly asked, his mind no doubt
thinking the same thing that just crossed Alicia&#146;s mind, &#147;I&#146;m betting
there&#146;s a good reason why I should have seen them, right?&#148;

&#147;Hum.&#148; Ron grunted, looking about for the badge a little bit more, if
only to satisfy his dominating older brother. &#147;I have to pack my stuff.&#148;

&#147;Help me find my badge!&#148; Percy shouted, which triggered a yelling match
between the two. Dazed and confused, Alicia barely had the chance to
retreat out the door as the two went at it.

She delivered Hermione&#146;s books (blushing abit as she realized she caught
Hermione in her pajamas getting ready for bed), and quickly headed back
to her room. Once inside the room she collapsed on the bed and sighed
miserably. &#147;I&#146;m never going to make it through this school year.&#148;

With that she drifted off to sleep, her blankets pulled up abit as she
whimpered abit (still not quite over her &#147;run-in&#148; with Hermione in her
jammies&#146;).

As she slept she dreamed ---

----

She was standing on one of the towers of Hogwarts, looking out towards
the lake near the school. She could sense she was waiting for something
to happen, yet she didn&#146;t know what.

She felt as if she wasn&#146;t alone -- someone was behind her.

It was a female presence, that much she knew -- and moreso she felt
comfortable in her being this close to her. Unbidden, two female arms
wrapped around her waist, and drew her close.

She felt her breath against the back of her neck, and was in heaven. It
must be -- could only be her -- she then drew in breath and began to
whisper&#133;

----

Alicia woke up with a start, staring right at Percy who was looking at
her with an anxiousness over her bed. With a tired grunt she rolled over
face down on the bed. &#147;G&#146;way. I&#146;m too sober to even think of shagging
you.&#148;

However he did not go, he simply rolled Alicia over and asked her to fix
something.

&#147;Go spade and neuter your own kin.&#148; she grumbled, &#147;I&#146;m not a vet.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s my picture --&#148; he showed a rather blank picture with the top of a
familiar head poking from the picture frame. &#147;-- Ron spilled tea on it
and --&#148;

With a tired rasping grunt Alicia snatches the picture away, and rolls
back onto her face to cover her work. With a few seconds worth of magic
she fixes the picture and hands it back. &#147;Loser.&#148;

&#147;We have to go, it&#146;s breakfast time and then we&#146;re heading to the train
station.&#148;

Two bleary eyes stared up from the bed at him, &#147;Penelope encourages your
need to look at naked women other than herself often?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; he answered honestly.

&#147;Then get out of my face so I can actually get up.&#148;

Five minutes later she was dressed in her school uniform robes and
downstairs for breakfast.

The copy of the Daily Prophet was there, and once again it was fixated on
the manhunt for Sirius.

Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she made
as a young girl, the three being rather giggly. Alicia simply ate
silently and looked about the table, still only half awake after being
roused from such an interesting dream.

She didn&#146;t even get to see who was behind her -- and she knew in her
heart that she wanted to know who it was -- had to know, to be more
precise. But, for now, thoughts of that had to be shelved since the day&#146;s
events were ahead of her and her dream -- just like the girl in said
dream -- were behind her.

The process of lugging down their luggage to the cars to take the trip to
the station, and waiting for said cars to arrive, did nothing to improve
her lackluster mood. Once again coming face to face with the large
furball that was Hermione&#146;s cat didn&#146;t do much to improve her already
dismal attitude.

&#147;It&#146;s all right, Crookshanks,&#148; Hermione cooed in such a soft way, &#147;I&#146;ll
let you out on the train.&#148;

&#147;Oh no you don&#146;t!&#148; Ron snapped, trying to grab Alicia&#146;s arm to pull her
into the debate, &#147;Tell her she can&#146;t do it! What about poor Scabbers!!
Doesn&#146;t she have any consideration for him!!&#148; (pointing at his chest as
he spoke, the large lump in his pocket no doubt Scabbers.)

At that moment, before the conversation could degrade further, the cars
finally arrived.

They were huge old-fashioned dark green cars, each of which was driven by
a wizard wearing a very snappy velvety emerald colored suit.

&#147;Like getting taxi service from the Wizard of Oz.&#148; Alicia remarked,
loading her stuff into one of the vehicle&#146;s trunks. Alicia got into a car
with Harry, Hermione and Ron, and the trip went smoothly.

Too smoothly. In fact it was rather uneventful. Maybe it was Alicia&#146;s
mood but nobody seemed willing to talk about much past the mild
conversations about the new school year, Quidditch, and who was going to
do well in the Quidditch World Cup tournament.

Alicia had her favorites, like everyone else, and rooted for England to
win -- mostly because she had a bit of a fascination for the team&#146;s
female Seeker who she had seen images of (in both full dress and a few
naughty images from her appearance in a popular erotic publication).

As they neared the station, Alicia began to feel the stronger and
stronger presence of Cho Chang. She was already there, no doubt, and her
aura stood out the most since Alicia has been seeking it out for weeks
now.

She was so focused she barely noticed their arrival at King&#146;s Cross, and
how quickly the drivers found them trolleys for their baggage and were on
their way quickly. Her thoughts were focused.

In fact she was so focused she went through the barrier between platforms
nine and ten without even waiting for instructions, coming onto the
platform for 9 &frac34; looking rather vacant as she scanned the area for Cho.
She knew that Cho would sit with friends from Ravenclaw, but she just
wanted to glance at her once before boarding.

Someone taps Alicia on the shoulder, bringing her about to face --
Olivier Wood. Quite annoyed that it wasn&#146;t Cho, Alicia turned to continue
scanning the platform.

&#147;You already missed her. She&#146;s onboard.&#148;

Alicia gritted her teeth, and narrowed her eyes. It was as if he knew
EXACTLY what she was up to, and no doubt he did&#133; the smug bastard. Alicia
huffed her breath and pushed her cart towards the train, &#147;Don&#146;t be
getting all uppity with me, Wood.&#148; she grumbled irritably.

&#147;Have you looked over some of the plans I sent you&#133;&#148;
&#147;Yes, yes, I have. We can talk about it at school, or do you plan to
torment me all the way to Hogwarts with your&#133;&#148;

&#147;I just want to be ready for the year, that&#146;s all. After all it&#146;s my -- I
mean --&#148;

Alicia knew where he was going. &#147;I know. I know. Give me a break. We&#146;ll
get it this year. Now get on board and let&#146;s just get there with some of
my sanity intact before you beat Quidditch into my skull.&#148;

With that Olivier left her be. Once he was gone she had her stuff stowed
onto the train and made her way to her usual place on the train. However,
before she could get into the train she was tapped on the shoulder by a
familiar face. &#147;Mind if we chat abit?&#148;

Following the dark haired asian woman&#146;s motion, she followed the 7th
Judgement to one of the pillars as they talked. &#147;Maniac obsessive
behavior does not suit you.&#148; Alicia snipped.

&#147;You know about Sirius Black, right?&#148; she asked.

&#147;What&#146;s with everyone&#146;s obsession with Black? Next you&#146;ll be wondering if
I remembered that the thing that killed those guys was a Galerian that
seems to be stalking me.&#148;

Keiko facefaults, but quickly recovers, &#147;Uh -- yeah. See you got that
down pat.&#148;

&#147;So&#133;&#148; Alicia asked, &#147;&#133;is there a change in plans? Do I hunt Black or
not?&#148;

At that Keiko turned grim, &#147;Don&#146;t worry. Black will find you.&#148; and at
that she leaves.

-----

Alicia shared a compartment with her Quidditch partners on the trips to
Hogwarts. Of course, the first time she took the ride she rode with Harry
but after she got to know a few people herself she looked forward to
riding with them.

Angelina and Katie seemed to be abit more off than usual. They just sat
next to Alicia grinning like crazy, and she didn&#146;t know why. Of course it
didn&#146;t take long for them to say why, but just looking at their wide
grins even for a few minutes made the revelation that much better as long
as they stopped looking so darn smug!

&#147;We did it!&#148; Katie pronounced proudly, smiling right into Alicia&#146;s face
as if she was supposed to know what that was supposed to mean. &#147;We did
it, we ARE doing it, and we&#146;ll be the first!&#148; Angelica jumped in. All of
this was quite exciting to the two, but Alicia was in the dark.

&#147;Ok.&#148; she replied deadpan style. &#147;For an instant now, pretend I have no
idea what you&#146;re talking about &#133; because I don&#146;t &#133; and tell me again what
you did &#133; if possible.&#148;

The two exchanged grins, and then said in unison &#147;We&#146;re going to become
an item!&#148;

Silence. Long silence. Alicia didn&#146;t know what to make of it&#133; because she
still didn&#146;t know what they were driving at. &#147;Try that again. That last
shot went over the top of the train.&#148;

Katie nudged Angelica, &#147;We&#146;re coming out!&#148;

&#147;&#133; is this your haphazard way of telling me that last year&#146;s Halloween
screw up actually fostered some feeling in those one track minds of
yours? If not I&#146;m completely clueless&#133;&#148;

The two nodded their heads furiously.

Wouldn&#146;t you know it. One simple screw up turns into love&#133; how strange is
that.

When they were trying to find out about whether or not bad old Malfoy was
the &#147;Heir of Slytherin&#148; they were going to use a potion (Polyjuice
potion) to impersonate Malfoy&#146;s henchgoons. Alicia, however, wanted to
use a strong lust potion to get them into a rather nasty &#147;position&#148; and
kill two dragons with one lance, so to speak. The trio shot her plan
down, and she ditched her potion laced cupcakes in her room since nobody
would let her use them.

When the two took Hermione to Madame Pomfrey she went back to the dorm
only to find that somebody had already eaten her laced cupcakes and were
passed out on one of the beds tangled together panting and gasping. One
thing led to another, and when they left at the end of the year they were
already talking about a possible relationship. That was sometime ago,
this is now.

&#147;Got any good advice?&#148; Katie asked, &#147;I wanted to go to Hogsmeade and pick
up a naughty little toy or two but Angelica said we should take it slow
and work through our relationship both emotionally and sexually before we
go into heavy sex play.&#148;

&#147;Smart girl.&#148; Alicia agreed, &#147;Stick to oral and fingers for now.&#148;

And, at that, Alicia rolled over in her seat and tried to fall asleep.

Angelica put a stop to that 30 minutes into the ride.

&#147;&#133;no I don&#146;t want to do a threesome&#133; (and lord knows how wasted I must be
to even think of turning that kind of offer down)&#133; so go &#145;way.&#148; Alicia
grumbled irritably.

&#147;Actually we just heard about the new Defense Against the Dark Arts
teacher.&#148; she told Alicia.

Alicia wearily opened her eyes, and looked at the two, &#147;You can&#146;t be
lesbians if you thump him. That&#145;s an unspoken rule or something. No shut
up and --&#148;

&#147;No, no, I mean we heard he&#146;s nearby! Next compartment over as a matter
of fact!&#148;

With a tired sigh, Alicia pulls herself back into a half awake state and
stares at the two, &#147;And this would be so important because of -- what.&#148;

&#147;He looks rather -- off.&#148; Katie remarked with a suspicious look on her
face.

This didn&#145;t interest Alicia in the slightest. &#147;Snape&#145;s rather off and I
don&#145;t see you whining about him, so what&#145;s the big deal of working at
Hogwarts and being a &#147;little off&#147; anyway.&#148;

&#147;He&#146;s wearing a very shabby set of robes, looks rather under the weather,
and though he&#146;s rather young he acts like he&#146;s an old man since he&#146;s
collapsed in that room as if he was&#133;&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t say it.&#148; Alicia warned, regarding the two with a severe glance.
&#147;He probably traveled a long way to catch this train and it wore him out.
Nothing overtly suspicious about that is there?&#148;

&#147;But&#133; he hasn&#146;t moved since we started this trip and I don&#146;t remember
seeing him board this train at King&#146;s Cross either!&#148; Angelica complained,
bringing Alicia&#146;s severe gaze unto her next.

&#147;For god&#146;s sake give it a rest.&#148; she grumbled, &#147;Change the channel, this
topic is boring.&#148;

Silence reigned for a few minutes, which allowed Alicia to grab a few
minutes shuteye.

However the silence did only last for a few minutes.

&#147;How you think he got out?&#148; Katie asked, eyes staring upwards at the
ceiling, &#147;No one really knows how he got out of Azkaban, you know. No
one&#146;s ever done it before, and he was one of their top security prisoners
too!&#148;

&#147;So you didn&#146;t watch last night&#146;s episode of &#147;Sex and the Witch&#148; did
you.&#148; Alicia remarked blandly, trying one more time to derail the topic
to something she actually felt like talking about.

Suddenly a strange feeling overcame her. She stiffened abit as she turned
her head slightly, eyes widening. &#147;Alicia? What&#146;s up? Alicia?&#148;

A soothing &#147;thought&#148; was brushing against the edge of her mind&#146;s eye. The
feeling was from the next room over, where Potter and -- this Professor
Lupin were, and was focused on the only mind she never felt before&#133; this
having to have been Lupin&#145;s mind since he was new to her.

He was sleeping, she could sense that much, and the thoughts at the top
of his mind was so tranquil -- to the point of being relentlessly
tranquil. Odd. It was as if he simply HAD to be at peace, forging through
force of will this &#147;quiet place&#148; in his mind that he used to bring
himself to peace. Then again &#147;bring&#148; seemed inappropriate. More like
forced.

Now mind you that in itself was not unusual, but the way he made this
&#147;world&#148; through sheer force of will was something else entirely. Almost
unnatural even.

However in any case Alicia finally decided to ignore his &#147;thoughts&#148; and
leave him be.

Just as well since Hermione and Ron&#146;s thoughts were now cluttering the
space in the next compartment, the topic being quite obvious to the point
that she didn&#145;t need to even bother peeking. Hermione&#146;s cat was looking
at Scabbers again as a form of nourishment. Not good.

By 1PM Alicia was more than glad that the trolley with food came about
because she had her fill of playing referee to Hermione/Ron in the next
room over, and finally just shut them out of her mind so she could relax.
The first thing Angelica asked was about Professor Lupin, to which the
attendant handing out the food simply replied &#147;He&#146;s alright, just
sleeping.&#148;

This of course brought forth a debate that it was some sort of spell or
sleeping sickness, which Alicia shot down with a &#147;Oh for goddess&#146; sake
why don&#146;t you two just eat each other out if it&#146;d keep you &#147;quiet&#148;
(relatively speaking) for the rest of the damn trip!&#148;

That ended the topic concerning Professor Lupin rather quickly.

However it didn&#146;t end the talking in the room.

Five minutes later Oliver Wood popped in to talk Quidditch, only to be
chased out five more minutes later by a rather pissy Alicia who only
wanted to eat her meal in peace and quiet.

She didn&#146;t mind him talking the game. She DID mind him shoving his
diagrams and plans into her lap disrupting her attempts to eat a meal in
peace and quiet.

Malfoy tried to drop in. Mind you he &#147;tried&#148;, but the instant the door
opened Alicia mistook him for Wood and screamed death threats at the
door&#133; which shut quickly sending a rather disturbed Malfoy and his now
shaking and shivering cohorts into Potter&#146;s area.

An hour later the topic of Hogsmeade came up.

&#147;Do you two plan to talk me to death, or is this a scheme to deprive me
of rest.&#148; Alicia griped, finally waking up for good. &#147;Ok. Ok. I&#146;m up. So
what&#133;&#148;

&#147;Do you know much about Hogsmeade?&#148; Angelica asked.

&#147;Not really.&#148;

True. Alicia had in fact heard nothing about Hogsmeade.

&#147;I heard it&#146;s the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain --&#148;
Katie remarked, suddenly catching Alicia&#146;s disapproving gaze. &#147;I mean
non-Mug-- non-magical human&#133;&#148;

&#147;What age did you lose your humanity again?&#148; Alicia sneered. &#147;You know I
disapprove of this Muggle nonsense. Last I checked you had as much red
blood and human DNA as a normal non-magically inclined human being so
give me a break with this Muggle nonsense willya!&#148;

And, to accentuate her point, she drops her head back and stares
listlessly at the ceiling.

&#147;So what else is there in Hogsmeade besides normal-phobics.&#148;

&#147;&#133;Honeydukes?&#148;

The word alone brought a warming little smile over Alicia&#146;s face. &#147;Uh--&#148;
(Katie stumbled, uncertain why Alicia started grinning) &#147;-- it&#146;s a
sweetshop and it&#146;s got a whole bunch of great stuff in it&#133; lots of treats
like&#133; like&#133; why are you doing that?&#148;

Alicia, not realizing she was being spoken to, sighed. &#147;Sweet.&#148;

&#147;Alicia? Alicia&#133;&#148; (tap tap) &#147;&#133;Alicia&#133;&#148;

Quickly she snaps out of her deep thoughts and sits upright quickly.
&#147;Nothing. Nothing. So score me some goodies when you go, huh? I&#146;m
treating.&#148;

Confusion reigned.

&#147;What do you mean by that?&#148; Angelica asked, &#147;Aren&#146;t you coming?&#148;

&#147;Can&#146;t. I couldn&#146;t get my form signed so I&#146;m just out of luck.&#148;

For some inexplicable reason a look of total fear and shock came over the
two.

&#147;What. What.&#148; Alicia demanded, &#147;You two look like I just admitted to
having an affair with Snape! What is it!&#148;

&#147;WHATTYA MEAN YOU&#146;RE NOT ALLOWED TO COME!! BUT -- WHO&#146;LL BUY MY FIRST
STRAP--&#148;

(Angelica shuts Katie&#146;s mouth before she screams out every sorrid detail
of her sexual life in the tight confines of the train)

&#147;I&#146;m sure you&#146;ll do fine without me.&#148; Alicia assured her. &#147;Girl&#146;s gotta
pick the&#133; (ahem)&#133; tool that is right for her anyway. You&#146;ll do fine
without me.&#148;

Slowly, but surely, it began to rain. But even with it raining that
didn&#146;t help Alicia to sleep.

Mostly because the two wanted to ask her 101 questions about their
relationship, but not all at once. She was woken up again, and again, and
again, and again with every sort of imaginable question until finally she
demanded they write it all down in the form of a quiz that she PROMISED
she&#146;ll fill out AFTER she settled in at Hogwarts.

It darkened outside, and yet the two didn&#146;t stop waking Alicia up.

Finally she gave up trying to rest and decided to just stay up until
bedtime that night.

&#147;Unless you two plan to talk me to death this year.&#148; Alicia grumbled,
pulling a sip from a soda she brought to keep her up &#147;just in case&#148;
something like this happened.

Suddenly the train started to slow down.

&#147;Well we&#146;re here now so let&#146;s get going! I&#146;m st--&#148;

Alicia thrust her hand up, stopping Angelica in mid sentence. &#147;No way.
It&#146;s too soon. We&#146;re not there yet.&#148;

&#147;So why are we stopping?&#148;

The train was slowing, but Alicia&#146;s mind was already drowning that out as
she reached out to feel the whole lay of the land about her. Everybody
was understandably confused, and it showed in their thoughts. In fact the
entire train had become a &#147;pool&#148; of confusion and conjecture as to the
reason behind the stoppage. Even though the wind and the rain grew louder
in noise, that didn&#146;t stop everyone from conversing over what was going
on. They simply spoke louder.

However, for Alicia, it was their thoughts that &#147;spoke&#148; the loudest.

Fear, confusion, conjecture and speculation, a whole range of thoughts
and feelings.

The train lurched finally to a halt, as luggage came loose from racks to
come banging down with thumps and bangs which sent tendrils of fear and
shock through those closest to the noise.

That&#146;s when the new thoughts came into range.

Silent. Nearly empty if not for the driving obsessive &#147;thought&#148; that
drove them.

Two thoughts in actuality. One was hunger, but the other screamed louder
and overdrove even the need to feed. &#147;FIND SIRIUS BLACK!!&#148;

That thought screamed in a hollow raspy tone outside, from more than one
&#147;target&#148;.

&#147;FIND SIRIUS BLACK!!&#148;

The feeling of hunger was there, but that urge overrode even that. An
obsessive urge.

&#147;FIND SIRIUS BLACK!!&#148;

She knew they were here, and she was compelled to go to them.

Telling her companions to stay put, she quietly moved out of the
compartment and walked down the corridor towards the source of the
thought. She didn&#146;t have to go far though&#133; they were coming towards her.
So she stopped, and stood her ground, waiting.

The voices about her became concerned, and panicked. Fear and confusion
was so thick it acted like a sea of &#147;emotions&#148; which flooded the whole
train. Just as well since as long as she kept her own emotions &#147;subdued&#148;
she was effectively &#147;invisible&#148; in this sea of high level emotions.

For the longest time nothing. But then, finally, the first Dementor
scrapped it&#146;s way towards her.

That&#146;s when she realized they were coming at her from behind as well.

Cursing herself for missing the other batch coming through the front she
held the first she saw in her gaze, not wavering as she waited for it.
The other Dementors were all searching the train, no doubt for Black
since their thoughts were dead set on that one task.

That&#146;s when the feeling of intense cold hit.

Coming from the Dementors, it was the &#147;aura&#148; of dark despair they were
soaked in. She felt this when she visited Azkaban that one time and was
prepared for it.

Before, when she went to Azkaban, she only had willpower and some of her
old energy to fall back on. But now that she had her full measure of
energy again she used it. Digging in deep she drew forth her aura which
powered herself up. And, while not visible to the naked eye, it shone
like a bright beacon against the darkness surrounding the Dementors.

The creatures hesitated before her, then simply asked her in her head for
Sirius Black.

&#147;Not here.&#148; she replied honestly. &#147;You&#146;re just plain out of&#133;&#148;

Somebody screamed. A horrific, terrible terrifying scream. Pleading. Pure
terror.

Then it happened again. Distant. Hollow. Almost as if she was feeling
emotions second hand instead of from the source. But she couldn&#146;t--
that&#146;s when she realized one of the screams was coming from the Dementor
in front of her.

She focused on it, causing it to drift back from her abit&#133; as if it felt
her probing it and didn&#146;t like having it&#146;s own &#147;medicine&#148; fed back to it.
Seconds passed.

Then everything became clear.

Alicia&#146;s aura dimmed, and darkness reigned once again.

Before everything went white as she lashed out.

-----

&#147;Harry! Harry! Are you all right?&#148; (slap slap --)

&#147;Would you stop that? I said wake him, not beat him silly!&#148;

Harry, groggy and wasted, slowly woke from his stupor. Lanterns were
above him, providing illumination as people looked over him. The train
was moving, obviously, since it was shaking, and the lights had come back
on. He was on the floor as Ron, Hermione and Alicia looked over him.
Alicia seemed abit haggard but fine as she tended to him. Behind them he
could see Neville and Professor Lupin watching them. &#147;You OK? You look
abit green.&#148;

Surely enough he felt abit green too. A feeling of sickness overwhelming
him. When Alicia helped him with his glasses he felt a cold sweat on his
face. Slowly Ron and Hermione heaved him up and back into his seat. &#147;You
OK?&#148; Ron asked with concern.

&#147;Yeah, I guess.&#148; said Harry, his gaze turning towards the now empty
doorway. The Dementor that visited their cabin was long gone. &#147;What
happened? Where&#146;s that -- that thing? Who screamed?&#148;

&#147;No one screamed,&#148; said Ron, but Alicia suddenly interrupted saying &#147;So
it was from you.&#148;

Everyone turned towards her for an explanation, but she simply shrugged
their gazes off and went back to her cabin without uttering another word.
Before she could leave, however, Professor Lupin shoved a large block of
chocolate into her hand and told her to share it with her companions in
her compartment. Nodding her head, she went back and did exactly that.

Still. What happened&#133;

-----

It tried to shield it&#146;s thoughts of it&#146;s last meal from her, but failed.

Enroute to this spot it ran into a couple. A young male and an older
woman.

It fed from them and left them a heap on the ground, holding each other
desperately trying to stave off the cold as they held onto their love as
the last bit of warmth left after&#133;

Her light dimmed, and her eyes burned red. Hate and anger filled her and
her aura burst into bright rage as she lashed out without a second
thought. Nothing destructive or dangerous. But in her condition she was
instinct and rage alone. With a single motion she &#147;dismantled&#148; it from
the inside out and turned it to dust, leaving it&#146;s psionic &#147;scream&#148; as it
died horribly.

The scream silenced the entire train&#146;s emotional ocean. It&#146;s depth and
pain so strong it could be felt by all about her, even if they didn&#145;t
understand what they were feeling. But it also stopped the Dementors in
their tracks and turned their gaze onto her all together.

That&#146;s when things went weird.

Instead of attacking they simply marshaled to her side&#133; and bowed.

They all turned their hollow gaze to her and -- waited.

For a few seconds she had nothing to say but soon she began &#147;barking&#148; out
orders. Reprimanding them and sending them back to Hogwarts to form a
defensive barrier.

In truth she felt that they had wasted their time.

Spreading their number across such a large distance in an attempt to find
Black left too many gaps and holes on the &#147;road&#148; to Hogwarts, and for one
as cunning as Black must have been it would have been child&#146;s play to go
around the Dementors spaced out in such a way.

They had to remass, and take defensive position about Hogwarts to insure
Black didn&#146;t get any closer. They dropped the ball in her opinion, pure
and simple, and somebody had to pick it up.

She didn&#146;t know much of what happened, but she knew one thing.

They stopped screaming in their &#147;minds&#148; &#147;FIND SIRIUS BLACK!!&#148; and now
were focused on something else&#133; her. It was as if she had, by accident,
killed their &#147;Alpha&#148; and she was now the &#147;Alpha&#148;.

&#147;How many years do you get for killing something already dead&#133;&#148; she
whispered.

Neither Angelica nor Katie felt like prodding her for an explanation

This lingering thought would go with her all the way to the stop, and
onto the carriages for the ride over to Hogwarts.

In fact she was so focused on the Dementors that, when she got out, she
barely bothered with Malfoy. Barely. A drawling, quite delighted with
himself voice came out of nowhere.

&#147;You FAINTED, Potter? Is Longbottom telling the truth? You---&#148;

Alicia grabbed his arm, twisted it hard, and silenced him. &#147;Shut up.&#148;

And, with that, she threw him aside and stormed Hogwarts without another
word.

-----

Lupin was right behind her as she walked.

&#147;Is something wrong? You seem rather off.&#148;

&#147;I get cranky around feeding time.&#148; she snapped off at him without
bothering to stop.

She walked, stormed more likely, all the way into the cavernous entrance
hall and up the marble staircase towards the Great Hall. However, before
she could reach the doors she heard an old familiar voice call out to
her, &#147;Having a bad night, are we?&#148;

Alicia didn&#146;t need to turn to know who was addressing her. &#147;No arrogant
superiority complex, Professor Snape? It seems I&#146;m not the only one whose
having a bad night.&#148;

Snape didn&#146;t remark, or even try to shoot back, he merely motioned for
her to follow him which she did. As they reached his office he seemed
abit concerned. &#147;I heard there was trouble on board the train tonight.&#148;

&#147;So you say.&#148;

Suddenly Snape pulled chocolate from his robes and thrusts it at her.

&#147;Sorry, mum warned me against taking candy from strangers&#133; and you&#146;re
&#147;stranger&#148; than anyone else I ever met here.&#148;

&#147;You have no idea what you&#146;re getting yourself into.&#148; he remarked, urging
her to take the chocolate until she finally did, taking a big hunk off in
one bite. &#147;So enlighten me, then.&#148;

&#147;Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that Potter was taken ill on
the train. Two minutes later I receive an owl stating that all the
Dementors were suddenly on the move, no longer seeking out Black but
racing here&#133; any reason why?&#148;

&#147;I told them to marshal here.&#148; Alicia answered truthfully, Snape&#145;s face
twisting into complete shock at this announcement before he regained his
composure to return to his normal dreary appearance. &#147;They were wasting
their time spread so far apart. They need to focus a tight defensive
parameter around the &#147;target&#148; before Black gets too close and axes
Potter.&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t know you cared so much about Potter.&#148; Snape hissed, his temper
rising.

&#147;Too bad I can&#146;t say the same about your lack of care about Potter.&#148; she
countered.

A few tense seconds passed before Snape spoke again, &#147;Professor
Dumbledore is not pleased at all with their presence here.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t blame him. They&#146;re not a particularly positive element to have
near a school like this. Anyway the only reason Potter fainted is because
the Dementors dredged up bad memories&#133;&#148; (stops to ponder what she felt)
&#147;&#133;probably a memory of the death of his mum. More than enough to take a
lot out of even the strongest of males&#133;.&#148; (stops, chewing on her
chocolate abit before speaking again) &#147;&#133;speaking of strong, I heard
you&#146;re once again passed up for the Defense opening. That isn&#146;t going to
make you anymore vindictive than usual, now will it?&#148;

Snape motions for Alicia to follow him back to the Great Hall without
another word.

-----

By the time Alicia and Snape rejoined everyone, separately of course to
not give off an impression they were friendly (in a sense) with each
other, the sorting of that year&#146;s new students was over.

But it wasn&#146;t over yet, as Professor Dumbledore stood up to address all
in the room.

&#147;Welcome to another year at Hogwarts!&#148; Dumbledore said with great pride,
beaming with energy as he spoke. &#147;I have a few things to say to you all,
and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out of the
way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast&#133;&#148;

&#145;No surprise what that topic is going to be.&#146; Alicia thought to herself.

&#147;As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our
school is presently playing host&#133;&#148; (a sense of reluctance and bitterness
etches into his voice, only to fade as he continues) &#147;&#133;to some of the
dementors of Azkaban Prison, who are here on Ministry of Magic business.&#148;

He paused, and Alicia knew he was doing a poor job hiding his hate of the
Dementors.

&#147;They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds. And while they are
with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without
permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises -- or
even Invisibility Cloaks.&#148; he added, obviously being in the know about
Harry invisibility cloak. &#147;It is not in the nature of a Dementor to
understand pleading or excuses.

I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm
you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure
that no student runs afoul of the Dementors.&#148; he concluded.

Percy seemed quite charged up by this part of the speech, puffing his
chest up in a show of ego.

&#147;On a happier note,&#148; Dumbledore went on to say, &#147;I am pleased to welcome
two new teachers to our ranks this year. First, Professor Lupin, who has
kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts
teacher.&#148;

Approval of Mr. Lupin seemed lukewarm at best&#133; but all he needed was a
few days to get to know the students better before the big payout. And,
considering how shabby Lupin looked, it was little wonder why he got such
a lukewarm reply.

Snape, fuming in his chair, turned his gaze towards Lupin and sneered an
expression best known with contempt and loathing than enthusiastic
approval.

Dumbledore continued. &#147;As to our second new appointment, well, I am sorry
to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with
his remaining limbs.&#148;

&#145;Bull.&#146; Alicia thought to herself, smirking abit as she remembered the
circumstances of his &#147;retirement&#148;. Seems one day he brought in that
special magical creature that moved the Earth for him. A female shape
shifting werewolf&#133; though he didn&#146;t know it was the kind that became
human at will. Sufficient to say it only took one incident of catching
the two in the woods &#147;mating&#148; to get him thrown off the staff. In fact
she still had the moving photos she took of their wedding since he
invited her last year, after she got to know him since she spent abit of
time hiding out at his place just to avoid seeing her own classmates when
suspicions fell on her as a possible &#147;Heir of Slytherin&#148; (herself and
Harry were the ones singled out as candidates for various reasons).

So wrapped up in these memories she was that she almost missed the
announcement. Almost.

The applause Hagrid got as new teacher for Care of Magical Creatures
outdistanced the lukewarm reply that Lupin received. For his part he
seemed quite taken back by the applause, blushing furiously under the
intense &#147;approval&#148; everyone was showing.

&#147;We&#146;ve should&#146;ve known!&#148; Ron yelled over the applause, pounding the table
in an enthusiastic show of support. &#147;Who else would have assigned us a
biting book?&#148;

Ron, apparently, had looked at someone else&#146;s book on the trip and it bit
him.

Alicia ended up having to settle down 5 dozen more books on the trip,
mostly to keep the panicked yelps and pain &#147;emotions&#148; out of the air so
she could have a moment&#146;s rest&#133; or at least TRY to rest between the
endless inquiries by Katie and Angelica.

The feast started soon after.

Alicia went up during the feast to speak to Hagrid. Nobody seemed to
mind, and the usually bossy Snape was in fact rather silent when she
approached, as if waiting to speak to her.

She didn&#146;t disappoint.

To Hagrid she said &#147;Well done, Hagrid. You&#146;re moving up in the world.&#148;

&#147;I had a little help from me friends.&#148; he said humbly, &#147;Great man,
Dumbledore&#133;&#148;

Alicia turned her thoughts to Snape.

&#147;He doesn&#146;t know, does he? Dumbledore I mean.&#148;

&#147;What are you thinking?&#148; Snape responded in thought, trying not to
distract Alicia too much from her &#147;conversation&#148; between him and Hagrid.
&#147;He said some of the Dementors were here&#133;&#148;

Suddenly Hagrid burst into tears and Alicia found herself being shooed
away by McGonagall.

As she turned to leave, however, she thought one last thing to Snape.

&#147;They&#146;re all here. Every last Dementor within 1000 miles&#133; they&#146;re here.&#148;
