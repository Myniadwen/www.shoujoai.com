<a href="../nonanime/drivewolf-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Fillmore!  Ingrid!  What.  Happened?&quot;  Principal Folsom had just 
arrived at the nurse&#39;s office.  Her face was hard, angry, and just a 
little bit concerned.

&quot;It&#39;s Jun&#39;s first day back at X,&quot; she said, pacing the room as the two 
officers stood near the door of the enclosed room in the office.  &quot;I 
made you two-my best Safety Patrollers-her bodyguards.  First you let 
that Renault boy into the garage.  Then you let Jun challenge him to a 
race and go through with the race.  Now I hear she&#39;s collapsed on your 
watch.  What happened?&quot;

&quot;Please, Principal Folsom, it&#39;s not their fault,&quot; Nadia Renault spoke 
suddenly, opening the door of the enclosed room and stepping into their 
midst.  &quot;Jun&#39;s all right-she&#39;s just a little anemic now because of the 
accident last year.  She tried too hard at the race.  She&#39;s all right, 
really.  She&#39;s awake now.&quot;  Folsom let out a heavy sigh, pressing her 
manicured fingers against her temples.

&quot;Is there anything else I should know about?&quot; she asked tersely.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Fillmore admitted grudgingly.  &quot;Renault challenged her to a 
two-month build-off-whatever that means.&quot;

&quot;A build-off is where a person or a team have a certain amount of time 
to build something of similar fashions to outdo another person or team,&quot; 
Ingrid replied.  At the raised brows she received, she shrugged.  &quot;I 
watch a lot of the Teaching Channel.&quot;

&quot;What are the stakes?&quot; Folsom questioned.

&quot;All of Jun&#39;s titles,&quot; Fillmore answered.  &quot;Head technician, president 
of the Mech Club, and captain of the motocross team.&quot;  Folsom frowned 
and rubbed her temples harder.

&quot;Jace Renault,&quot; she said angrily, &quot;is little more than a delinquent who 
knows how to weld and ride a bike.  Jun Faolan is the greatest technical 
mind to cross X&#39;s threshold in years.  I want you two to make sure that 
nothing goes wrong during this build-off thing.  Do not let Renault take 
her rightful positions.  Do not let him sabotage her.  Am I understood?&quot;

&quot;Crystal,&quot; Ingrid responded.  Folsom nodded, turned, and left the 
office.  Fillmore and Ingrid turned to Nadia.

&quot;You said that Jun&#39;s awake?&quot; Fillmore inquired.  Nadia nodded and walked 
back into the room with Ingrid and Fillmore following.  Jun was sitting 
on the psuedo-couch in the room, which was little more than plush 
cushions on a wood ledge.  She was leaning heavily into the junction of 
the walls, her denim jacket draped over her front.  She still looked 
quite pale.

&quot;Bloody hell,&quot; Jun grumbled when Nadia sat ddown in a chair next to her. 
&quot;Feel sick as a drowned rat.&quot;

&quot;Jun Faolan?&quot; Ingrid asked.  She and Fillmore stood at the end of the 
couch-ledge where Jun&#39;s feet were.  Jun looked up at them expectantly.  
&quot;Principal Folsom is assigning us to be your bodyguards during your 
build-off.&quot;

&quot;Guessed as much,&quot; Jun muttered.  She didn&#39;t seem very keen on the idea 
of opening her mouth much.  &quot;Don&#39;t think Renault&#39;s against a bit of 
sabotage.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the idea,&quot; Fillmore agreed.  &quot;It&#39;s safe to say that he might try 
anything to get your titles-and abuse &#39;em.  So, starting tomorrow, we&#39;ll 
be with you for most of the day and whenever you&#39;re working for the 
build-off.&quot;

&quot;So &#39;m gettin&#39; bodyguards?&quot; Jun asked with a faint smile.  &quot;Along with 
my tutor?&quot;

&quot;Tutor?&quot; Ingrid questioned.  &quot;You don&#39;t get your grades waved?&quot;

&quot;I do my work,&quot; Jun replied.  &quot;&#39;Sides, Nadia&#39;s a good tutor.&quot;  Nadia 
blushed crimson.  &quot;My dad&#39;s probably going to be here soon to pick us 
up.  Thanks for the escort up here, officers.&quot;  Seemingly summoned by 
the words, a man with an abundance of thick muscles burst into the room.  
He was pale before he saw that Jun was awake.

&quot;Jun!&quot; he sighed.  &quot;Thank goodness.  Thought you&#39;d really passed out for 
a while there.  Come on.  Let&#39;s get you home.  You coming, Nadia?&quot;  
Nadia nodded with a bright smile.  The man walked to Jun, turned about, 
and crouched down.  Jun put her arms around his neck and he easily 
lifted her up off the couch.  Nadia followed them as they left the room.

Ingrid and Fillmore watched them leave before leaving as well.  They 
abruptly parted when Ingrid continued to walk back towards Safety Patrol 
headquarters.

&quot;You gonna do some digging?&quot; Fillmore asked.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ingrid said with a nod.  &quot;You&#39;re right.  Something about this 
whole case is giving off a bad vibe.  Late?&quot;

&quot;Late,&quot; he responded.  They parted with their staple nod and went their 
separate ways.

----------

&quot;Did you find anything yesterday?&quot;  Ingrid shook her head, still staring 
at a sheet of paper.  Three separate files were spread across her desk, 
one for Jun, one for Nadia, and one for Renault.

&quot;Everything seems to check out,&quot; she said.  &quot;From old photos that were 
in the past few yearbooks, Nadia always seems to be with Jun, even when 
she wasn&#39;t at X Middle School.  She&#39;s technically a year behind Jun, but 
since Jun lost a year from her accident...&quot;  She trailed off, putting 
the sheet of paper down and looking up at her friend and partner keenly.  
Fillmore sighed and leaned against his desk.

&quot;So where does Jace fit in?&quot; he asked.

&quot;He doesn&#39;t,&quot; she answered.  &quot;That&#39;s the weird thing.  A few months 
after he and Nadia started middle school he joined the Mech Club, but he 
almost never went to any of the meetings.  After that, he started his 
vendetta against her.  No one knows why he hates her so much.  And to 
add insult to injury for him, Jun doesn&#39;t seem to care at all that he 
hates her.  She&#39;s polite to an exceptional degree.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s gotta make Renault ticked,&quot; he murmured.  &quot;So he joined the club 
after his sister had been there for a few months, skips out on the 
meetings, and starts gettin&#39; mad at Jun all the time.  There&#39;s really 
somethin&#39; missin&#39; from this.&quot;

&quot;Why does Renault hate her?&quot; Ingrid voiced the question aloud.  The bell 
rang and signaled the end of homeroom.

&quot;We can ask Jun and Nadia about it right now,&quot; Fillmore murmured.  &quot;Come 
on-let&#39;s get down to the garage.&quot;  They made their way through the swarm 
of students to the metal garage, but when they arrived, the door was 
closed.  A note on the door read: &quot;Mech Club meetings cancelled until 
January.&quot;  Fillmore tried to open the door, but it was locked.  He 
knocked.  There was a pause before Nadia opened the door.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said with a smile, stepping aside and letting them in.  
&quot;We&#39;ve been here since homeroom with the door locked.  Jun thought it 
would be a better idea if we kept the door locked since she and I are 
the only ones with keys.&quot;

&quot;Good thinking,&quot; Ingrid said with an appraising smile.  &quot;You won&#39;t have 
to worry about Renault bursting in on you.&quot;

&quot;And speaking of Renault,&quot; Fillmore rumbled.  &quot;Do you have any idea why 
he&#39;s got such a grudge against you, Jun?&quot;

&quot;Not a single one,&quot; Jun answered.  &quot;Never knew why he was so shirty with 
me.  Never cared to ask, really.  You live with him, Nadia-&#39;m sure he 
complains about me a lot.  Any ideas?&quot;  Nadia paused briefly before 
shaking her head.

&quot;He does complain a lot, but he never says why he doesn&#39;t like you,&quot; she 
sighed.  &quot;Maybe he&#39;s just jealous that you spend so much time with me 
and he doesn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Sounds logical,&quot; Ingrid muttered.  &quot;But if that was the case, why 
wouldn&#39;t he come to the Mech Club meetings?  That way they could both 
hang out with you.&quot;  Nadia shook her head with a faint sigh.

&quot;I&#39;ve tried to suggest that to him, but he always storms off and tells 
me to stop bothering him,&quot; she said mournfully.  &quot;He doesn&#39;t want 
anything to do with Jun.&quot;

&quot;Nadia, c&#39;mere,&quot; Jun said suddenly.  &quot;I need your opinion on this.&quot;  
Abandoning the conversation, Nadia walked quickly to where Jun stood.  A 
frame was on a lift and pieces of metal were on a table nearby.

&quot;It&#39;s going a sport bike,&quot; Jun answered the question the Safety 
Patrollers didn&#39;t ask.  &quot;The kind of motorcycle that you see for races.  
My father normally works with choppers.  Those are more for show and are 
harder to ride.  Honestly though I think I have a good idea to make this 
bike look just as good as a chopper.&quot;  Nadia looked the bike over, 
examining the metal pieces and the frame.

&quot;How are you going to be able to make this?&quot; Ingrid asked curiously.  
&quot;Even Folsom won&#39;t shell out thousands of dollars to help you.&quot;  Jun 
grinned at her.

&quot;My dad&#39;s introducing me to the business of motorcycles,&quot; she said.  &quot;He 
says that I&#39;ve done enough work for him to pay for a few bikes, and he&#39;s 
going to help me buy the things we&#39;ll need.&quot;  Fillmore raised his brows 
in surprise.

&quot;Your dad does well, huh?&quot; he questioned.

&quot;I guess that&#39;s true,&quot; Jun murmured, looking towards the ceiling as if 
thinking about it for the first time.  &quot;Never thought of me-self as 
well-off before.&quot;  She shrugged slightly and turned to Nadia.  Nadia was 
running slender fingers over the metal pieces.

&quot;I think I have an idea,&quot; she said softly, vaguely as she continued to 
trail her fingers over the metal.  &quot;Are you planning a full-body 
casing?&quot;  Jun smirked and nodded.  Nadia smiled at her.  &quot;Then I think 
we&#39;ll go for a full-body drawing.&quot;  Jun grinned again.

&quot;If you&#39;re doing the painting, then we might win just for that,&quot; she 
chuckled.  She and Nadia leaned together over the pieces and began to 
speak in terms and specifications that neither Ingrid nor Fillmore 
understood.  The day continued in this thread.  Jun and Nadia began to 
cut metal and weld pieces together, occasionally calling to each other 
for input on something or for assistance on something.

Despite their total lack of knowledge in the mechanics field, Ingrid and 
Fillmore couldn&#39;t help but stay on their feet, standing a safe distance 
from the builders, but watching everything they did avidly.  Both of 
them, even Fillmore who had known of her before, soon realized why Jun 
was so admired for her technical skill.  She was a fast worker, but she 
checked each aspect of her work multiple times for any faults.  When she 
found one, which was neither rare nor common, she fixed it easily and 
just as quickly.

The bell rang almost too soon for the group.  Jun gave the clock in the 
garage a very ugly look, but cleared away her tools and packed pieces of 
paper into her courier-style bag.

&quot;My father will help me bring what we need tomorrow morning,&quot; she said 
to Nadia.  &quot;Are you going to have sketches done for me?&quot;  Nadia nodded 
quickly with a healthy blush.  Jun gave her a smile, pushing back her 
evident weariness and irritation with the time to favor her friend with 
that sign of friendship.  Nadia smiled broadly as well.

----------

The build went rather smoothly for the first month.  Neither Jun nor 
Renault let news of what they were building slip out to the Examiner.  
Renault was reported to snarl and show his fists to whoever asked him 
about his project, but Jun rebuked the questions with a vague smile and 
a reminder that she wouldn&#39;t tell.

Fillmore and Ingrid dodged questions as well, but only murmured a casual 
&quot;No comment.&quot;  The sport bike that Jun and Nadia were building was 
completed at the halfway mark.  As Fillmore and Ingrid were told on the 
last day of the first month, the only things that needed to be completed 
in this final month were to powder coat the frame, chrome certain 
pieces, finish the paint job on the body casing, reassemble the bike, 
wire it, and take the initial ride.

&quot;Ingrid?&quot; Fillmore questioned.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you a little early?  Wait, this 
is just like the Ultra-Box, isn&#39;t it?&quot;  Ingrid gave him a sheepish 
smile.

&quot;Well, you can&#39;t say that Jun doesn&#39;t have style,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;I&#39;ve 
never seen such a cool thing in my life.  I&#39;ve never met such a cool 
person.&quot;  Fillmore chuckled at the statement.  &quot;But Jun doesn&#39;t seem to 
care, does she?&quot;

&quot;Nope,&quot; he agreed, a thoughtful frown appearing on his face.  &quot;It&#39;s like 
she really only cares about how good her work is.  Even if tons of 
people say it&#39;s the coolest thing they&#39;ve ever seen, she just smiles.  
She never brags.&quot;  Ingrid looked thoughtful as they made their way to 
the garage.

&quot;Maybe Renault hates that about her,&quot; she sighed.  &quot;Maybe he&#39;d prefer it 
if she acted like she was the best builder in the school instead of like 
a average worker.&quot;  Fillmore shook his head.

&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it,&quot; he said.  &quot;You know, I don&#39;t even have an 
idea of why he hates her.  Maybe...naw, there&#39;s no way.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; she questioned.

&quot;You don&#39;t think maybe Renault&#39;s crushin&#39; on Jun, do you?&quot; he asked in 
return.  &quot;Some people act weird when they like someone.  Renault might 
get angry and jealous that his sister gets to hang out more with Jun 
than he does-he might want to spend more time alone with Jun.&quot;  Ingrid 
thought about this, but never received a chance to give her reply.  A 
shout and a curse echoed through the hallway, emanating from the garage.  
Fillmore and Ingrid broke into a run and knocked on the door sharply.  
Nadia pulled the door open, her eyes wide and shining.

&quot;Someone broke in and...and they...oh, no,&quot; she moaned, moving aside so 
the officers could step into the room.  The Safety Patrollers took in 
the scene with frowns on their faces.  Pieces of metal had been sawed 
from the bike and bent terribly.  The exhaust had been sliced in half 
and mangled.  The drive chain had been torn forcibly from bike and 
ripped apart, links of the chain scattered around the room.  The brake 
pads had been pried off as well and were tossed haphazardly on the 
floor.  Jun stood in the midst of the shards of her work, standing quite 
still and staring towards the bike.

&quot;Looks like Renault was just waiting for you to get this far,&quot; Fillmore 
sighed.  &quot;Dawg.  This is awful.&quot;

&quot;How could he get in?&quot; Ingrid asked.  &quot;I&#39;ve seen you lock the door 
everyday when we leave.  Could he have gotten your key, Nadia?&quot;  Nadia 
shook her head, looking quite distraught.

&quot;I wear it on a short necklace,&quot; she said.  &quot;I never take it off.  Even 
if I was asleep, Jace couldn&#39;t get it.  I&#39;m a light sleeper, so I&#39;d know 
if he took it. Oh, Jun, I&#39;m so, so sorry about this!&quot;  Jun did not 
reply.  After a moment, she let out a small scoff and lifted her hand to 
grab the goggles resting on her head.

&quot;You should never apologize if it isn&#39;t your fault,&quot; she said, her voice 
rather energetic and cheerful.  &quot;Your brother might think this is a 
setback for us, but I can repair all of this before the end of the day.  
We&#39;ll break it down, send the frame out for powder coat, and everything 
for chroming.  We&#39;ll polish everything off in three weeks or less.&quot;  She 
slid the goggles to rest over her eyes.  &quot;&#39;At&#39;s a promise, Nadia.&quot;  She 
smiled and gave Nadia a thumbs-up before diving into her task.

Jun was as good as her word.  She seemed to enter a higher gear than the 
previous month and flew through the damage as quickly as she had during 
the time trial she had beaten Renault in.  Shortly after noon, she and 
Nadia had broken the bike apart and packed the items for chroming.  
Jun&#39;s father arrived at twelve-fifteen to take the items to their 
destinations, as well as to escort Jun and Nadia to the powder coat 
shop.  Fillmore and Ingrid declined a polite invitation and replied that 
they had to remain at the school to insure that Renault did not break 
into the garage again.

The two girls returned before the end of the day and explained that the 
frame and the chromed parts would be delivered to the garage at six 
o&#39;clock exactly the next morning.  The deliverymen had received the code 
for the lock on the garage door and had promised to relock the garage 
after leaving the packages and the frame inside the building.  Fillmore 
and Ingrid shared a semi-perturbed glance.

----------

The reason for the unhappy expression on the patrollers&#39; faces was 
simple: December had just started.  That night, the town received a 
frigid snowfall.  Unfortunately for everyone that went to X Middle 
School, the snow was not deep enough to warrant a snow day and they were 
forced to bear the chill.  Ingrid and Fillmore, however, were on school 
grounds with a few other patrollers by five forty-five in the morning.

&quot;So me, Tehama, and Anza were walking your beat, right?&quot; Danny O&#39;Farrell 
said in a low voice as he and Fillmore hid behind a bush near the metal 
garage&#39;s loading area.  &quot;I see this kid who&#39;s got a real shifty look, 
you know?  So I say &#39;X Middle School Safety Patrol!&#39; and he just-&quot;

&quot;O&#39;Farrell,&quot; Fillmore sighed warningly.  O&#39;Farrell took the warning and 
shut his mouth fairly quickly.  Fillmore plucked his talkie from his 
belt and lifted it to his mouth.  &quot;Ingrid, do you see anything?&quot;

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Ingrid replied.  She peered from around the tree she was 
behind, lifting binoculars to her eyes and looking for any signs of 
movement at either side of the loading dock.  &quot;Has O&#39;Farrell asked the 
question yet?&quot;

&quot;You know, maybe Jace Renault isn&#39;t going to do anything,&quot; Danny 
murmured thoughtfully, looking up at the light snowfall that had started 
only moments ago.  Fillmore sighed at him.

&quot;Yes,&quot; he grumbled over the talkie.  &quot;The truck left five minutes ago.  
Renault should be here soon.  Vallejo&#39;s up at the door inside, so 
there&#39;s no doubt that he&#39;ll come around back.  We just have to wait.&quot;

&quot;Hold on,&quot; Ingrid said, her voice dropping to a whisper.  &quot;There&#39;s 
someone coming up the path.  It&#39;s definitely Renault.  Get ready.&quot;  
Fillmore clipped the talkie back onto his belt and waited.  Renault 
jogged around the corner and heaved himself up onto high ledge.  He 
punched in the code for the door to open without a single hesitation and 
slipped inside when it was low enough for him to crouch under the door.  
He came back out carrying a box full of chromed pieces.

&quot;Jace Renault!&quot; Fillmore rose to his feet and called out when Renault 
jumped to the ground, box in his arms.  &quot;X Middle School Safety Patrol!  
Put down the box and come with us!&quot;  Renault put the box under one arm, 
groped in his jacket pocket, and threw what looked like a full water 
balloon at Fillmore.  Fillmore dodged in time, but O&#39;Farrell received 
the balloon in the face.  It exploded and splattered paint all over the 
red-haired boy.  Renault was already off and running.

&quot;Ingrid, come on!&quot; Fillmore shouted as he started after Renault.  Ingrid 
rushed out from her hiding place and caught up with Fillmore, matching 
pace with him as they tore after Renault.  The two officers were fully 
prepared to chase Renault clear across campus, but they didn&#39;t have to.  
Renault had stopped when he came around the foremost corner of the 
school.  Jun stood before him, frowning angrily at him.

&quot;If you&#39;re so confident of your work, why are you sabotaging me?&quot; she 
snapped.  &quot;Or trying to, you pathetic little bug.&quot;  She paused, staring 
at Renault.  He was trembling visibly, his knees shaking as if he was 
utterly terrified.  A moment later, he fell to the ground, dropping the 
box in the snow and covering his face with his hands to try and muffle 
the sob that wrenched from his throat.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Jun!&quot;  Fillmore and Ingrid almost jumped at the voice.  The 
thief-the saboteur-was Renault, but it was Nadia Renault.  &quot;I&#39;m so 
sorry!&quot;  Jun stared at her in shock.  Nadia only sobbed.
