<h1>Opportunities: A Tale of Civil War (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<pre>&quot;So, which side are you on?&quot; the young woman asked
dryly, casually tossing a playing card into the hat
sitting on the table. Her short red hair was spiked
up, and her muscles rippled as she moved, the last
card filling the battered hat to the brim.

&quot;My own,&quot; the other woman said with a sigh as the
blacked haired woman settled into a seat. &quot;Katrina,
you going by Mankiller or Amazon now?&quot; she asked
politely.

Katrina Van Horn smiled wryly, her blue eyes amused,
&quot;Amazon, it has more class.&quot; She looked at her
curiously, &quot;You register yet, Skein?&quot;

The woman in the black leather shook her head as Skein
said, &quot;I&#39;m not interested in letting the government
know where I am, thanks.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Katrina nodded, keeping a wary eye on her
companion. Skein was a former supervillain like
herself, but unlike her was more than a bit crazy. As
the Gypsy Moth Skein used her fabric control powers to
kill, and had possibly murdered her husband. &quot;Getting
out of the country, Skein?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know yet,&quot; Skein conceded, &quot;I guess it all
depends on how hot things get.&quot;

&quot;Very hot,&quot; a brown haired young woman groused as she
walked up to their table.

&quot;How did you hear about this safe house, Joystick?&quot;
Katrina asked suspiciously.

&quot;Heard about it from Trickshot,&quot; the gold and black
clad costumed woman said. Her bodysuit clung to her
curves, golden gauntlets on her hands.

&quot;You on the run too?&quot; Katrina asked.

&quot;Aparently being a former Thunderbolt doesn&#39;t cut much
slack with the pro-regs,&quot; Joystick pulled her black
half mask off. &quot;I&#39;m staying the night then bolting for
Canada.&quot;

&quot;Nice to have some ladies here, Janice,&quot; Skein said,
looking at the other heroine thoughtfully.

&quot;There&#39;s not many rooms if you plan to stay,&quot; Katrina
noted, gesturing around the crowded living room they
were all sitting in. They were surrounded by twobit
supervillains and third stringers, gathered for safety
until they decided when and how they were going to
bolt.

&quot;I bet you have a room, though,&quot; Janice noted with a
sly smile, &quot;most of these mooks wouldn&#39;t dare cross
Mankiller.&quot;

&quot;Heh, true,&quot; Katrina acknowledged.

&quot;Well, then I suppose we couldn&#39;t just bunk with you?&quot;
Skein asked, smiling at Katrina engagingly.

Katrina hesitated a moment then nodded, &quot;What the
hell, but just for tonight.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Janice nodded with a grin. She ran a hand
through her hair, &quot;So, is there any beer in this
place?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got something better than that,&quot; Skein smirked.

&quot;Uh uh,&quot; Katrina said firmly, &quot;bad idea. If the
pro-regs do hit here, I want to be sharp, not drugged
out of my mind.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got a point,&quot; Janice noted.

Skein pouted, &quot;Well, does anyone mind if I smoke?&quot;

&quot;Your funeral,&quot; Katrina shrugged, watching Skein pull
out a home rolled cigarette from somewhere in her skin
tight costume.

&quot;We could have used someone like you in the great
game,&quot; Janice noted after a moment.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Katrina looked at her curiously.

&quot;The Game was a contest between superhumans,&quot; Janice
revealed, &quot;with your serious attitude and commanding
manner you&#39;d have made a killing.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the type,&quot; Katrina shook her head.

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t know,&quot; Janice leaned forward with a
winning smile, &quot;I think you&#39;re pretty impressive.&quot;

Katrina raised a eyebrow, noticing how the vlack and
gold cloth of the woman&#39;s costume highlighted her pert
breasts. &quot;Are you coming on to me?&quot; she asked with a
half smile.

Janice winked, &quot;Why not?&quot; A smile as she licked her
lips, &quot;Or are the stories about you untrue?&quot;

Katrina reached out to stroke Janice&#39;s cheek, &quot;Oh,
they&#39;re true all right but...&quot;

&quot;But?&quot; Janice purred.

&quot;I get the feeling you&#39;re a player, little lady,&quot;
Katrina said seriously, &quot;how do I know I&#39;m not being
played right now?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t,&quot; Janice conceded, &quot;but isn&#39;t that half the
fun?&quot;

Katrina grinned, &quot;What the hell, why not?&quot;

Janice got up, &quot;Then lead the way, handsome. What do
we do about Skein?&quot;

Katrina casually picked up the now stones villainess,
&quot;Next question?&quot;

&quot;Lead on,&quot; Janice grinned.

The back bedroom was dingy, reminding one of a dive
hotel but neither woman really was paying attention to
that. Dumping Skein in a battered old chair Katrine
calmly pulled off her muscle shirt, revealing sculpted
muscles and firm breasts. &quot;Like what you see?&quot; Katrina
asked with a grin.

&quot;Ooh yeah,&quot; Janice purred as she ran a hand over the
muscles of her arm then over to cup a breast
teasingly. She reached up and kissed Katrina
lingeringly even as her hands began to roam the taller
woman&#39;s body.

&quot;You&#39;re an agressive one,&quot; Katrine helped the smaller
woman strip off her uniform,

&quot;I like that.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll like me even more later,&quot; Janice promised as
she carefully pulled off the golden metal gauntlets
she wore.

&quot;What&#39;s with the heavy metal?&quot; Katrina asked as she
lead Janice over to the shabby bed.

&quot;My weapons,&quot; Janice grinned, &quot;though I won&#39;t need
them for you.&quot;

Katrina laid Janice down, climbing on top of her as
she growled teasingly, &quot;You may need all the help you
can get.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;m up to the challenge,&quot; Janice nipped at
her neck.

Kissing her possessively Katrina agreed, &quot;You know,
you might just be right.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0

BOOM! The explosion rattled the building, the three
women on the bed jerking awake at the same time. &quot;Wha&#39;
the hell?&quot; Skein muttered, laying nude between Janice
and Jatrina. Feeling lonely last night she had slipped
into bed with them, soon being pulled into a erotic
dance with them both.

&quot;Crap,&quot; Katrina cursed as she scrambled out of the bed
and grabbed at her costume, &quot;we&#39;re under attack!&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d they find us?&quot; Joystick grabbed her gear,
pulling on her clothes then the matching golden metal
gauntlets.

&quot;Worry about that later,&quot; Katrina said briskly, &quot;we&#39;ve
got to go.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Skein rose from bed then used her power over
fabric to reshape their bedding into a simple dress.

&quot;Isn&#39;t that, well, sticky?&quot; Janice asked as they
hurried through the house, ignoring the panicked
supercriminals as they raced for the front door.

&quot;I know,&quot; Skein smiled dreamily, &quot;but it reminds me of
last night.&quot;

&#145;Eww,&#39; Katrina thought as she grabbed the door and
wrenched it open to see the waiting federal agents.
There were nearly a dozen men and women waiting, all
outfitted in capekiller armor, with armored transports
behind them with their weapons trained on the house.
&quot;All right,&quot; she cracked her knuckles ominously,
&quot;who&#39;s first, boys?&quot;

&quot;Sorry lover,&quot; a voice purred before a burst of energy
knocked Katrina out from behind.

Sometime later Katrine awoke with a splitting
headache, almost instantly feeling the restraints on
her body. She strained, eyes closed to try to bread
free but to no avail. &quot;Give it up,&quot; Skein sighed,
&quot;we&#39;re under power dampers.&quot;

Katrine looked around, seeing that they were in some
kind of holding cell, restraints holding them nearly
immobile. &quot;Where the hell is Joystick?&quot; she demanded
coldly.

&quot;Right here love,&quot; Joystick smirked from the other
side of the bars.

&quot;You sold us out,&quot; Katrina said flatly.

&quot;I lead the pro-regs right to you,&quot; Joystick agreed
with a smirk, &quot;in exchange for a million dollars and a
flight out of the country.&quot;

&quot;When I get out of this...&quot; Skein hissed.

&quot;You&#39;re not getting out of this,&quot; Joystick said
flatly, &quot;they&#39;ve got brains like Reed Richards and
Tony Stark behind this plan. No, I&#39;m going to save my
own skin and this is the best card I have to play.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t forget this,&quot; Katrina said grimly.

&quot;Last night will forever have a place in my heart
too,&quot; Joystick smirked.

&quot;Maybe so, but I am going to hurt you for today,&quot;
Katrina scowled.

&quot;Promises, promises,&quot; Joystick sauntered off.

Katrina sat back with a sigh, then a small smile
tugged at her lips. &#145;Well,&#39; she thought, &#145;at least
last night was fun.&#39;

End

Notes: I thought it&#39;d be interesting to look at a trio
of low end supervillains during Civil War. The
characters of Skein and Amazon are in fact bi or
lesbian, depending on the writer, while Joystick
appears to be straight.
