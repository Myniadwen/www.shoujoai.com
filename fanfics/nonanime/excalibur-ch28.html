<h1>The Excalibur Alternative (part 28 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>Codex&#39;s expression was serious as the clones burst
free from Sinister&#39;s holding chambers, her mind racing
as it considered alternatives. &quot;Blaze,&quot; the brown
haired woman said as her team of new Marauders began
to kill clones of the old squad, &quot;get ready, help will
be arriving shortly.&quot;

&quot;Are you insane?&quot; Siena Blaze asked as the butchy
looking blonde threw a energy bolt into a copy of
Sabertooth, toasting him before he could gut Shades.

&quot;I&#39;ve got a plan,&quot; Codex grinned as she tossed a
grenade and blew up a copy of the light wielding
villain Prysm.

BOOM!

The first wave of hot-knives slashed through attacking
clones as Excalibur burst from cover, the team racing
forward to attack the forces of Sinister from the
other side. Spitfire lead the charge, the gold garbed
super-speedster trailing flame as she hammered foes
with rapid fire punches. Britannia was nearly as fast
as the super strong woman rammed into sinister&#39;s army
like a freight train. Beside her a elfen women swung
her sword with lethal intent, her eyes gleaming
dangerously. Marvel Girl soared in on telekinetics,
psionically tearing foes apart as Widget slipped away,
heading to a intact computer bank.

&quot;You knew,&quot; Blaze blinked.

&quot;I love it when a plan comes together,&quot; Codex said as
she kicked another Scalphunter clone in the head.

&quot;All right everyone,&quot; Pete dodged a strike from
Harpoon as he ordered, &quot;I want scorched earth! We&#39;re
destroying the whole facility!&quot;

&quot;Just what I wanted to hear,&quot; Britannia said. The red,
white and black clad heroine ripped up a bank of
equipment and pitched it at a confused band of clones,
squishing them wetly.

&quot;Watch yourself, m&#39;love,&quot; Llyan swung her sword to
decapitate a clone trying to slip by their guard.

Grabbing shards of glass and metal Marvel girl ripped
into dozens of copies, but the creatures kept coming.
&quot;Sinister&#39;s been a busy little beaver,&quot; Rachel
muttered.

Widget put her hand against one of the wall mounted
panels, her silvery metal skin shifting as tendrils of
material flowed into it. The expression on her face
went remote as she interfaced with the systems of the
lab, sending commands to find data and delete it all.

&quot;Look out,&quot; Skids extended her force field, the blonde
Marauder blocking several throwing blades before they
could reach Spitfire.

&quot;This doesn&#39;t make up for sucker punching me earlier,&quot;
Spitfire informed her then she smiled, &quot;but thanks.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Skids blocked another wave of Riptide&#39;s
throwing blades.

A wave of flame incinerated the Riptide clone, in the
process slahging several other copies. &quot;You alright?&quot;
Thermal asked, Rusty Collins hands blazing with his
psychic fire.

&quot;Thanks love,&quot; Skids grinned, skating on her force
field over to his side.

Fighting hard Pete forced himself over to Codex&#39;s
side, the black haired man smiling grimly. &quot;Fancy
seeing you here,&quot; he said as he used his hot-knives to
blast another copy of Sabertooth to ashes.

Not even trying to deny the implication Codex said,
&quot;Yes, I gambled on your team being here, too.&quot;

&quot;This was all a plot against Mr Sinister?&quot; Pete asked
as he punched Arclight in the head, stunning her.

&quot;No, not until I realized he had betrayed us, too,&quot;
Codex shrugged, &quot;it was why I let Bezerker get
captured by you.&quot;

&quot;Figures,&quot; Pete kicked Arclight to make sure she was
down.

&#145;Pete,&#39; Rachel&#39;s voice echoed in his mind, &#145;Kate&#39;s
done. The genetic data they stole has all been
destroyed.&#39;

&#145;Good,&#39; Pete grinned. &#145;Sinister!&quot; he yelled.

&quot;Damn you,&quot; Sinister hissed, the white faced villain
quickly sweeping the battle field with his eyes. His
central lab was quickly becoming a shambles as
Marauder and X-Men thrashed the place, cloning tanks
and equipment exploding violently.

&quot;Save it,&quot; Pete said firmly as their teams battled
fiercely, &quot;your data&#39;s been whipped, and we&#39;re taking
Bezerker in. You want to surrender?&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t over,&quot; a surprising voice echoed through
the facility, that of a woman.

&quot;Wait, I...&quot; Sinister started to say, his expression
oddly panicked.

THOOM!

Sinister disappeared, an odd red/purple energy
distortion whisking him away even as the facility
shook around them, the walls cracking. The surviving
sections of the lab began to collapse, the stones
hanging from the ceiling crashing down.

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Pete scowled, &quot;everyone, back to the
tunnel!&quot;

&quot;What about the Marauders?&quot; Kate yelled as they raced
out of the facility.

&quot;They can take care of themselves,&quot; Pete answered
firmly. In fact he was almost certain that Codex had
one or more plans ready to get her team out... it was
just the sort of woman she seemed to be.

&quot;I can&#39;t gate us out,&quot; Widget called apologetically as
they ran, &quot;too much interference from the machinery
here.&quot;

&quot;Then we do it the hard way,&quot; Marvel Girl said as they
reached the shaft up to the helicopter. &quot;Alley opp,&quot;
she grabbed Spitfire and sent her flying up the shaft
as the woman squealed in shock.

Britannia grabbed Llyan and they soared up even as
Pete was tossed up, too. &quot;Get going,&quot; Pete yelled as
he disappeared.

&quot;Coming,&quot; Marvel Girl grinned as she soared up after
them.

As the ground rumbled and collapsed there was a
detonating sound, then silence. &quot;Well,&quot; Pete lit a
smoke, &quot;two out of three ain&#39;t bad.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Spitfire asked.

&quot;We stopped Sinister and took away the data,&quot; Pete
said with a frown, &quot;only the new Marauders got away.&quot;

&quot;So why do you look so grim?&quot; Spitfire asked.

&quot;Yeah, why?&quot; Kate asked, Widget&#39;s silvery skin
gleaming as she held Rachel close.

&quot;When Sinister was teleported away he almost looked
scared,&quot; Pete said, &quot;like he was scared of whoever
rescued him.&quot; A pause, &quot;And anybody who scares a piece
of work like Sinister worries me.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Rachel said firmly, &quot;but that&#39;s a problem for
another day.&quot;

Pete nodded, &quot;True enough. All right everybody, grab
the copter pilot and let&#39;s go home.&quot;

End.
