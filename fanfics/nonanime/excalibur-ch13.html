<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>        Pete Wisdom stood there impatiently, puffing on a smoke as he 
waited. His black hair fell into his eyes, the long black trenchcoat he 
was wearing matching his typical black suit. &quot;What&#39;s taking so long?&quot; he 
muttered.

        Jackie strode up the hall, her white hair falling around her 
shoulders. Her clothes were stylish but formal, the English woman 
looking every inch the noblewoman. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Jackie smiled slightly, &quot;but 
I thought I should dress the part.&quot;

        Pete smiled wryly, &quot;You do look good.&quot; He tilted his head to the 
side, &quot;But why...?&quot;

        Jackie shrugged, her woman&#39;s business suit sleek in the bright 
lights of the hallway. &quot;If they don&#39;t talk to a former Black Air agent,&quot; 
she nodded to him, &quot;they might be intimidated a bit by a hereditary 
noblewoman.&quot;

        &quot;Not bad,&quot; Pete nodded.

        Kate Pryde walked towards them, Rachel Summers right beside the 
older woman. The redhead still looked a bit wobbly from the stun grenade 
she had been hit with but she was clearly recovering. Kate kept a 
worried eye on her, her posture gently caring.

        &quot;They look cute together,&quot; Jackie murmured.

        &quot;Yeah, they do,&quot; Pete agreed quietly. Once Kate reached them he 
spoke up, &quot;So how are you doing, Rachel?&quot;

        &quot;Feeling stupid about being blind-sided like that,&quot; Rachel said 
dryly.

        Kate&#39;s brown hair was pulled back neatly, a bit of gray hair 
mixed in. &quot;Where are you headed?&quot; she asked curiously.

        &quot;Back to the site,&quot; Pete smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;ll use my cellphone 
to let you know when we need to be picked up.&quot;

        &quot;Got it,&quot; Kate nodded. The illusion of an older human woman 
shifted, revealing the silver metal beneath it as Kate rose up into the 
air, light shining from within her. Waves of energy stabilized, forming 
a shining portal before them.

        &quot;Good luck,&quot; Rachel called out as Pete then Jackie disappeared 
through the portal.

        The facility on the edge of London, England was busy with police 
and emergency services, the damaged wall roped off. A light rain fell 
down, a police officer looking up with an irritated expression on his 
face as they approached. &quot;Hold it,&quot; the redheaded young man held up a 
hand, &quot;this is a crime scene.&quot;

        Pete hit him with a look that made the office step back in 
surprise. &quot;Pete Wisdom,&quot; he held up his identification, &quot;Weird 
Happenings Organization and representative of the European X-Men.&quot;

        &quot;Sir!&quot; The young man looked visibly nervous, both by Pete&#39;s 
presence and the cold expression on Jackie&#39;s face. &quot;How can I help you?&quot; 
he managed.

        &quot;Who&#39;s in charge here?&quot; Jackie asked crisply.

        &quot;Inspector Dai Thomas,&quot; he said. He smiled at them weakly, &quot;I&#39;ll 
just go get him, all right?&quot; With that he all but fled.

        &quot;Nice,&quot; Pete smirked.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Jackie nodded. She gave him a thoughtful look and 
asked, &quot;You recognized the Inspector&#39;s name?&quot;

        &quot;An old associate of Excalibur,&quot; Pete said with a wry smile, &quot;as 
well as once being a bit of a superhero himself, sort of.&quot;

        &quot;I remember,&quot; Jackie nodded slightly, &quot;he was once a Knight of 
Pendragon.&quot;

        The man who approached them didn&#39;t look much like a superhero. 
His brown hair was thinning, he was a bit overweight, and his brown suit 
and trenchcoat were battered and soiled. Still, meeting his eyes you saw 
a spark of capability, the surety of a man very good at his job.

        Dai scowled, &quot;So who are you two?&quot;

        &quot;Jacqueline Farnsworth Crighton,&quot; Jackie met the lightly shorter 
man&#39;s gaze calmly, &quot;and Pete Wisdom of the European X-Men, Excalibur.&quot;

        &quot;Thought you weren&#39;t officially joining yet,&quot; Pete stage 
whispered.

        &quot;Oh hush,&quot; Jackie responded softly.

        &quot;So,&quot; Dai looked the two of them over as he growled out, &quot;would 
you care to give a statement about what the hell your team was doing 
here? We caught your earlier appearance on the video surveillance 
system.&quot;

        Jackie had to smile to herself slightly. Dai was clearly 
unintinidated by either the secret agent or the noblewoman. If it was 
possible he seemed even more irritated towards Pete, but that might have 
just been her imagination.

        &quot;We responded to the alarm and attempted to stop a group of 
superhuman agents,&quot; Pete said wryly, &quot;however by better teamwork they 
got the best of us and bolted.&quot;

        &quot;Huh,&quot; Dai took notes, looking at Pete suspiciously to ask, &quot;do 
you have any idea who these mystery attackers were?&quot;

        &quot;Nothing confirmed,&quot; Pete shook his head, &quot;but more than a few 
were superhumans with criminal records.&quot;

        &quot;Why do I get the feeling you&#39;re holding something back?&quot; Dai 
scowled.

        &quot;The only thing that we may be holding back,&quot; Jackie spoke up 
smoothly, &quot;amounts to nothing more than idle speculation.&quot; She flashed a 
slight smile, &quot;The sort of thing that a police inspector really can&#39;t 
use.&quot;

        Dai still didn&#39;t look very happy, but he also accepted he wasn&#39;t 
going to get anything more. &quot;Do you know anything about what was taken?&quot; 
he switched tracks.

        &quot;Their leader seemed pretty concerned with something she called 
Drives,&quot; Pete said dryly, &quot;I&#39;m assuming they were computer harddrives.&quot;

        &quot;Good guess,&quot; Dai nodded towards the building, &quot;they claim 
valuable data was stolen on those drives, along with biological 
samples.&quot;

        &quot;Endteck,&quot; Pete read the sign, trying to recall if he&#39;d heard 
the name before.

        &quot;Genetics research company specializing in researching the 
superhuman genome,&quot; Jackie said. Both men looked at her in surprise and 
she shrugged, &quot;I invested a while back.&quot;

        &quot;Think it&#39;s related to the attack on Muir Island a few weeks 
ago?&quot; Dai asked them pointedly.

        &quot;No,&quot; Pete shook his head, &quot;I don&#39;t think so. The teams that 
launched the attacks appear to be different, and the style was rather 
different as well.&quot;

        &quot;They snuck in on Muir Isle,&quot; Dai nodded slightly, &quot;this bunched 
just blasted their way in.&quot; He looked thoughtful, &quot;Ballsy of them, 
considering.&quot;

        &quot;They timed it pretty well,&quot; Jackie noted, &quot;they&#39;d probably have 
been gone before any police forces arrived. The only reason we got here 
fast enough to engage them was because we have a teleporter on the 
team.&quot;

        &quot;So they&#39;re both well organized and financed,&quot; Dai growled, &quot;if 
that fighter jet they used to escape in is any indication.&quot; He tucked 
his notebook away, &quot;I&#39;m getting back to work. Try not to interfere with 
my people while you look around.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Pete nodded as the older man left.

        &quot;You two have some history?&quot; Jackie asked as they walked around 
to the front door of the building, stepping inside out of the rain.

        &quot;Ran into him on an op. in London back when I was in Black Air,&quot; 
Pete put his smoke out casually as he continued, &quot;I ended up lying to 
him about being a police officer.&quot;

        &quot;Obviously he remembers,&quot; Jackie said as the two walked over to 
the frazzled looking young woman sitting at the reception desk.

        &quot;Can I help you?&quot; she asked wearily.

        &quot;Jacqueline Crighton,&quot; Jackie surprised Pete by taking the lead, 
&quot;as one of the shareholders I&#39;d like to speak with the president, 
please.&quot; She gave such a scowl that it would have done even the 
irritable Dai Thomas proud as she continued on forcefully, &quot;I was most 
displeased to hear about the attack on this facility.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll call him,&quot; the receptionist picked up the phone, pressing 
the button to connect her to the president&#39;s office. &quot;Sir, a Jacqueline 
Crighton is here, claiming to be a stockholder....&quot; she stopped 
listening. Her face went pale, &quot;Yes, sir!&quot;

        &quot;Well?&quot; Pete smiled slightly.

        &quot;You can go right in,&quot; the receptionist gulped.

        Jackie smiled as the two walked down the hallway together. &quot;You 
know it&#39;s occasionally nice to be wealthy,&quot; she said quietly.</pre>
