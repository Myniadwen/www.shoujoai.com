<h1>The Oddest Mystery</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There was a soft rustle of fabric in the darkness of
the van&#39;s interior, a creak, then the sound of a door
opening up. Daphne Black kept her eyes closed as she
waited for the door to close, then after a few moments
the redhead flipped the blanket aside and got up.

&#39;There she goes again,&#39; Daphne thought as the fully
dressed young lady opened up the door to the Mystery
Machine and slipped out into the night, &#39;but this
time, I&#39;m going to find out where she&#39;s going.&#39;

Daphne had known Velma for years, since they had been
little kids and she thought she knew the glasses
wearing girl pretty well. But recently Velma had
become oddly quiet, and whenever they were near a
larger city would slip away, sometimes for hours and
occasionally the whole night. She, Fred and Shaggy
tried to find out what she had been doing, but Velma
was oddly closed mouthed on the subject.

Daphne followed, leaving the parking lot they were
camped out in and following Velma into the city. The
street lights made is hard for Daphne to check but she
thought Velma looked a bit different. Her brown hair
was slicked down boyishly, her skirt appeared to have
been traded for jeans and most shockingly she was
wearing a jacket and t-shirt.

&#39;That&#39;s so unfashionable,&#39; Daphne thought to herself,
though she had to confess the other woman carried it
off pretty well. In fact, if Daphne was going to be
honest Velma looked kind of cute, if in a boyish way.

Velma paused at one corner and then hurried across the
street, joining a line of women who were waiting to
get into a bar. In front was a sign reading &#39;lady&#39;s
night&#39; and the sound of dance music pulsed out of the
doorway, the women talking as they waited. She moved
up the line steadily, paid the cover charge then went
in.

Now this put Daphne in a quandry. On one hand she
wanted to know what was going on with Velma, but going
into a bar?! With strange ladies? And in a bad part of
town like this? Still, it would probably be safer in
the bar rather than out here, and besides she was
getting cold in her fashionable blouse and skirt.

&quot;Hi, you&#39;re new here,&quot; a black haired young woman
noted with a charming smile as the line moved up
gradually. Much like Velma she was dressed in jeans
and t-shirt, and she had multiple earrings in just one
ear. As she smiled and tilted her head the earings
caught the light, glittering in the darkness.

&quot;I&#39;m just here looking for a friend,&quot; Daphne explained
as another group of people went in to the club.

&quot;Aren&#39;t we all?&quot; she smiled.

Daphne blinked, &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Guess witty commentary won&#39;t work,&quot; the girl muttered
self mockingly. &quot;Names Tasha,&quot; she introduced herself.

&quot;Daphne,&quot; she offered her hand politely.

Tasha took it, turned the hand so that the back was up
then purred, &quot;Charmed.&quot; With that she bowed and kissed
the back of Daphne&#39;s hand!

&quot;I... don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen anyone do that except
in the movies,&quot; Daphne stammered, feeling surprisingly
charmed by the woman.

&quot;Always wanted to try it,&quot; Tasha confessed as they
moved up yet again.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Daphne smiled.

&quot;So, you have a date tonight?&quot; Tasha asked. Seeing
Daphne&#39;s questioning look she added, &quot;You said you
were meeting a friend, right?&quot;

&quot;Uh,&quot; Daphne started then her eyes widened as certain
things clicked into place. &quot;We&#39;re just friends,&quot; she
stammered.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Tasha said as they reached the door
inside. &quot;Listen, I&#39;m meeting friends too,&quot; Tasha said
as she paid cover, &quot;but could I look you up for a
dance later?&quot;

Daphne knew the proper thing would be to refuse, but
instead she smiled as she murmured, &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;

&quot;Catch you later, then,&quot; Tasha hurried in.

&quot;How much?&quot; Daphne asked as she reached for her
wallet.

The tall blonde waved that off, &quot;Taken care of.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Daphne looked surprised.

&quot;The lady who just went in paid for you.&quot; the door
woman explained as she gestured for Daphne to go
inside.

&#39;Remind me to thank her later,&#39; Daphne thought as she
went in, looking around the darkly lit room curiously.

In front of her was a large area split into a dance
floor on one side and dining tables on the other.
Directly in behind them was a long bar crowded woith
people, with three women busy serving them various
kinds of drinks. To one side was a door leading back
to a kitchen, then oddly a library was set up, couches
and bookcases insulated a bit from the noise vy the
layout. Over on the other side of the room was a small
stage, currently being used by a young woman singing
along with a kareoke machine.

&#39;What a odd bar,&#39; Daphne thought as she tried to spot
Velma in the crush of people.

&quot;Hi,&quot; the green haired young woman standing by the
entrance way smiled and said, &quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s
Locket. My name&#39;s Alpha.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a interesting name.&quot; Daphne blinked.

Alpha smiled gently, &quot;I suppose. Were you looking for
dinner? I can ask Hyatt or May to help you get a
table...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Daphne quickly shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m just looking
for someone.&quot;

&quot;Then I hope you have a good night,&quot; Alpha bowed
slightly, then turned to greet another woman coming
in.

Daphne spent nearly ten minutes wandering looking for
Velma, but the crush of people made it hard to find
her friend. With a sigh she made her way up to the
bar, deciding it might be a good idea to get a drink.

&quot;Daphne?&quot; a surprised voice said as a hand grasped her
arm.

Turning Daphne blinked in surprise, seeing the black
haired with reddish tinted girl looking at her in
surprise. &quot;Sally?&quot; she blinked then added, &quot;Or are you
preforming as Thorn?&quot;

&quot;Sally&#39;s fine,&quot; she smiled as she stepped close to
Daphne. Sally McKnight was a singer whom they had
encountered on a case, a singer who played with the
band the Hex Girls. &quot;I never would have expected to
see you here,&quot; she said wryly.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t planning on this either,&quot; Daphne sighed
before explaining why she was here.

&quot;You haven&#39;t figured it out yet?&quot; Sally gave Daphne a
amused look as the blue haired twins took their
orders, &quot;Velma&#39;s gay.&quot;

Daphne nearly choked on her soda, &quot;She&#39;s what?!&quot;

&quot;She and Luna snuck off together during the whole
witch&#39;s ghost caper,&quot; Sally revealed, &quot;I thought you
guys knew.&quot;

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t,&quot; Daphne murmured, but even as she said
she could almost feel things dropping into place.
Velma&#39;s shyness, her resistance to Fred and her&#39;s
attempts to fix her up... all of it made sense now.

&quot;You look a bit stunned,&quot; Sally signaled for a refill.

&quot;I guess I am,&quot; Daphne admitted, &quot;it&#39;s going to take
some time for it to sink in.&quot;

Sally smiled as she sipped her drink, &quot;Well, if you
don&#39;t mind I&#39;ll let you absorb that for a bit.&quot; As
Sally moved to go she added, &quot;I think you&#39;ve made a
friend over there.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Daphne looked over to where Sally was pointing
and saw Tasha sitting a short way up the bar from her.
She blushed faintly, looking away shyly, then saw
Tasha get up to walk over to her side.

&quot;Did you find your friend?&quot; Tasha asked as she sat
down beside her.

&quot;No,&quot; Daphne admitted, &quot;but I&#39;m not sure it matters.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Tasha asked.

&quot;I think she&#39;s going to be all right on her own,&quot;
Daphne decided.

Tasha finished off her drink then gave Daphne a
thoughtful look. &quot;You don&#39;t look like you&#39;re taken...&quot;
she finally said.

Daphne though of Fred a moment, but he wasn&#39;t much of
a block. &quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m free as a bird.&quot;

&quot;Would you like to dance?&quot; Tasha offered.

Daphne smiled shyly, &quot;Who leads?&quot;

&quot;Me first,&quot; Tasha grinned, &quot;then we&#39;ll see what
happens.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Daphne let Tasha draw her from her seat
then off to the dance floor.

End...?

Notes: I doubt the Hex Girls or Velma are actually
gay, tho it is interesting how much Velma seems to be
thought of that way. A short spam fic with the
Scoobies, tho I sort of wish I had slipped in Fred &amp;
Shaggy&#39;s reactions. lol
