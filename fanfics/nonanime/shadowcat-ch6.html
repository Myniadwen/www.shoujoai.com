<h1>Shadowcat: Read or Die! (part 6 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/shadowcat-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        The little yellow car bumped it&#39;s way along the road, moving 
through the green hills towards the coast. Yomiko Readman was behind 
the wheel, the dark haired teacher humming to herself softly while 
she drived. Kitty Pryde sat in the passenger side, her short brown 
hair blown back by the gentle breeze from the open window.

        &quot;Thanks for driving me out here,&quot; Kitty said quietly.

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Yomiko gave her a smile, &quot;I try to visit 
Nancy&#39;s sister whenever I can.&quot;

        &quot;My sister, too,&quot; Kitty mused. They were going to visit the 
surviving clone of the woman called Nancy, a person created by using 
samples of Kitty&#39;s own DNA. It was all just a bit unnerving, 
especially considering they had no idea where the clones had 
originally came from.

        Anticipating Kitty&#39;s next question Yomiko 
explained, &quot;Nancy&#39;s last request was that I take care of her little 
sister.&quot;

        &quot;Ah,&quot; was Kitty&#39;s quiet answer. They pulled in to a 
concealed lane, driving up to a little private clinic. Getting out 
Kitty paused, stretching nervously in her jeans and T-shirt.

        Yomiko got out her suitcase and cart, pulling it behind her 
as her long overcoat rustled in the breeze. They fell into step 
going up to the building, and Yomiko gave Kitty a worried look. &quot;Are 
you all right?&quot; she asked the young lady.

        &quot;I&#39;ll manage,&quot; Kitty answered as they reached the door.

        &quot;Ms. Readman,&quot; the blonde attendant who answered the door 
gave a smile, then she looked over at Kitty, &quot;Miss Pryde, we were 
notified of your arrival.&quot;

        Yomiko presented her ID even as she quietly asked her, &quot;How 
is she?&quot;

        &quot;Nancy is out in the garden,&quot; the attendant explained.

        Kitty nodded slightly. They went through the building 
together, then out along a path to where a purple haired girl sat on 
one of the benches. She was dressed in a medical style gown, and 
over on one side of the bench were sheets of colored paper.

        &quot;Yomiko,&quot; Nancy beamed as she saw them coming up the path.

        Kitty was sort of in behind her, and once they got close she 
waved Kitty forward. &quot;Nancy, I&#39;d like you to meet Kitty,&quot; Yomiko 
smiled.

        &quot;Hi,&quot; Kitty said softly, meeting her clone&#39;s eyes.

        Nancy froze, the girl stiffening on the bench. Eyes 
strangely blank she vaulted over the back of the bench, shoving 
Yomiko aside as she went right for Kitty, her hand stiffened to 
strike.

        &quot;Oof!&quot; Yomiko hit the ground with a gasp.

        &quot;Stay down,&quot; Kitty barked at Yomiko as turned the blow aside 
with a single gesture, then ducking the follow-up kick almost 
instinctively. The two of them sparred back and forth across the 
green grass, Nancy pressing her hard, Kitty defending cautiously.

        &quot;Don&#39;t hurt her!&quot; Yomiko blurted.

        Kitty met the purple haired girl&#39;s eyes, seeing an odd 
blankness in them. &#39;She isn&#39;t doing this of her own free will,&#39; she 
realized, catching a fist in her hand. Nancy tried to phase, but 
Kitty kept up with her and forced the girl to the ground.

        Nancy gave a noiseless growl, grimacing up at Kitty as she 
struggled in her grip, but she couldn&#39;t get free. Slowly the fire in 
the girl&#39;s eyes faded, her struggles easing before she finally went 
limp. Blinking up at her captor in confusion she managed, &quot;Kitty-
san?&quot;

        Kitty helped her up, keeping a firm grip on the slightly 
younger woman. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; she asked her softly.

        &quot;Hai.&quot; Nancy looked at her in pure bewilderment.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Yomiko blushed slightly as both of then helped her 
up. After straightening up her clothes she demanded worriedly, &quot;What 
just happened?&quot;

        Kitty gently helped Nancy down to a seat, then nodding for 
Yomiko to sit down there, too. &quot;It looks like Nancy was programmed 
to go after me like that,&quot; Kitty quietly explained, &quot;probably 
without her even being aware of it.&quot;

        &quot;But why?&quot; Nancy blinked.

        Kitty gave her a slight smile, looking down at the girl who 
looked so very much like her. &quot;Because of our resemblance,&quot; she 
explained, &quot;it tells the story.&quot; Yomiko nodded slightly, the two 
women looking like mirror images as Kitty continued, &quot;If someone 
wanted to keep Nancy&#39;s origins a secret, they had to make sure we 
didn&#39;t meet.&quot;

        &quot;Big sister?&quot; Nancy asked Kitty hopefully.

        &quot;Eh?&quot; Kitty blinked.

        A bit of a blush appeared on Yomiko&#39;s cheeks, &quot;I told her 
about her big sister, not much, just that she was a hero.&quot;

        Kitty looked at the hopeful girl sitting beside her and 
smiled slightly as she agreed, &quot;Yeah, I guess I am your big sister.&quot;

        &quot;Nancy,&quot; Yomiko said softly, &quot;do you remember where you came 
from?&quot;

        With a little frown Nancy concentrated, looking oddly 
childlike sitting there. &quot;I&#39;m.. not sure,&quot; she finally 
admitted. &quot;It&#39;s all blurry and confused.&quot;

        &quot;Are there any people there?&quot; Kitty asked softly. Nancy 
nodded slightly, and Kitty reached over for the sheets of paper, &quot;Do 
you think you could draw them?&quot;

        Yomiko&#39;s eyes widened as she murmured, &quot;I never tried that 
before...&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Nancy smiled nervously. She took the pencil, 
scrapping it across the page as she tried to harness blurry memories 
into solid images. In a moment a smiling man&#39;s face appeared, a face 
that was oddly frightening. On his forehead, there was an odd 
triangle emblem.

        &quot;Sinister,&quot; Kitty narrowed her eyes, &quot;I was almost hoping it 
wasn&#39;t.&quot;

        The pencil began to move again, another image. The girl&#39;s 
hand began to shake slightly as she worked, as if the image she was 
creating frightened her, somehow. A final line then she all but 
thrust the sheets at Kitty and cried, &quot;Here!&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Yomiko blinked at the drawing.

        The Japanese demon mask was startlingly familiar to Kitty, 
so much so that she nearly dropped the paper. &quot;&#39;Ogun,&quot; Kitty said 
softly, slumping down beside Nancy.

        &quot;Who is &#39;Ogun?&quot; Yomiko demanded, looking at both women in 
confusion.

        &quot;A martial artist and psychic,&quot; Kitty clenched her hand, 
crushing the image, &quot;who forced me to become his apprentice. He 
would have raped my mind, if I hadn&#39;t been rescued by a friend.&quot;

        Nancy simply whimpered softly, the smaller girl curling up 
into a little ball. Yomiko looked down at her, putting her hand on 
Nancy&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Lets talk about this later,&quot; she said to Kitty 
softly, trying to calm Nancy down.

        The girl was so shaken that they finally had to sedate her, 
the staff of the hospital putting her to bed. &quot;Please try not to 
strain her so much,&quot; the blonde attendant scolded them fiercely, &quot;it 
isn&#39;t good for her recovery.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Kitty said wryly as they left. They both climbed 
into the car, pausing to look at each other. &quot;Sinister and &#39;Ogun may 
have been involved in all this,&quot; she sighed, &quot;it could be a trick.&quot;

        &quot;Eh?&quot; Yomiko looked confused.

        &quot;It&#39;s not that hard to create false memories, a friend of 
mine had some problems because of that,&quot; Kitty sighed. Gravely she 
continued, &quot;But for now, we assume that it&#39;s true.&quot;

        Yomiko looked over at Kitty worriedly and asked, &quot;But if 
that&#39;s so, then why would they want to clone you?&quot;

        Kitty made a face, &quot;When we last met I found out &#39;Ogun 
wanted to possess me, more or less. It could be he wanted a clone of 
me for the same reason.&quot;

        &quot;And the other Great Ones?&quot; Yomiko asked.

        &quot;It could be that was unrelated to Nancy,&quot; Kitty rubbed her 
face tiredly, &quot;Sinister and &#39;Ogun taking advantage of someone else&#39;s 
project to create her.&quot;

        &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Yomiko asked.

        &quot;Head back to base,&quot; Kitty shrugged, &quot;and hope that Joker 
and his people have had some luck in chasing down the original 
Nancy&#39;s movements. And we&#39;ll add &#39;Ogun&#39;s name to their list of 
people to look our for, too.&quot;

        &quot;Then lets go,&quot; Yomiko started up the car and they headed 
out onto the roads again.
