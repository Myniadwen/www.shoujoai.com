<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>        Kitty excused herself from Pete Wisdom as soon as she possibly 
could manage it, quickly collecting her teammates. At their questions 
she just tersely replied, &quot;We&#39;re heading back, now.&quot;

        &quot;All right,&quot; Rogue said firmly as Kitty smoothly brought the 
jet into the air and then kicked in the afterburners to send them 
rocketing across the sky, &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot;

        &quot;Looks like an old friend of ours might just be back,&quot; Kitty 
said, keeping her attention fully focused on her flying.

        &quot;Who?&quot; Bishop asked from his seat just behind them.

        Kitty looked back at the other woman in the cabin, &quot;You 
already know, don&#39;t you Sage?&quot;

        Sage nodded, her own expression grim, &quot;Stryfe.&quot;

        &quot;Give the lady a prize,&quot; Kitty said grimly, &quot;I figure Sakura 
and the Brotherhood are working for him. Which means we need to let 
Storm and the others know about this, fast.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re actually worried,&quot; Rogue noted softly, so that only 
Kitty could hear.

        Kitty nodded slightly, &quot;I got bored once, read through his 
data file. It&#39;s pretty scary reading. He&#39;s certifiably nuts, and is a 
telekinetic more powerful than Jean Grey herself. I don&#39;t even want to 
think about what he could do to someone with that kind of power.&quot;

        Rogue reached out and gently put her hand over Kitty&#39;s on the 
controls, &quot;We can deal with this, love. That, I promise you.&quot;

        Kitty smiled at her, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

        The trip back to Australia was mostly silent, each X-man lost 
in their own private thoughts. They returned to the beach house as 
quickly as possible, their friends waiting for them outside.

        Heather didn&#39;t wait for Sage to say hello, she just crushed 
the slim dark haired woman to her as she said, &quot;I was worried about 
you.&quot;

        A blushing Sage smiled up at the blonde, &quot;It&#39;s good to see 
you, too.&quot;

        Ororo just had to smile at that. She noticed Kitty&#39;s grave 
expression and asked her, &quot;What&#39;s the situation on Muir Isle?&quot;

        &quot;Muir Isle may just be the tip of the iceberg,&quot; Kitty said 
softly.

        &quot;And we&#39;re the Titanic,&quot; Bishop added.

        &quot;We&#39;d better go inside,&quot; Kitty added, &quot;there&#39;s a lot to talk 
about.&quot; She and the others who had gone to the island gave Storm a 
summary of the situation, and a quick and dirty council of war was 
soon underway in the living room.

        Sage used the projection system to give a refresher to her 
teammates, as well as to inform the two new members, &quot;Stryfe is a 
clone, created in the far future from the DNA of Nathan Christopher 
Summers, a.k.a. Cable. He was raised by Apocalypse, intended to be the 
host for that immortal&#39;s essence, but Nathan, along side Scott Summers 
and Jean Grey, was able to stop the transference and destroy 
Apocalypse himself.&quot;

        &quot;Evil twin,&quot; Heather said dryly, &quot;how original.&quot;

        Sage had to fight back a smile at that comment but continued, 
&quot;Stryfe swore vengeance on all three of them for what they had done.&quot;

        &quot;They saved him from being possessed, and he swore vengeance?&quot; 
Raven raised her eyebrow. Ororo just smiled and shrugged at her lover.

        &quot;Stryfe battled against Cable in the future, but he was never 
able to entirely defeat him or his allies,&quot; Sage said, &quot;so instead he 
traveled back in time, to try to destroy those that inspired Cable and 
his forces, the X- Men. And Cable followed to try to stop him.&quot;

        Rogue waved a hand to get Sage&#39;s attention, &quot;I was wondering, 
how long has Stryfe been operating in our time?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s hard to be exact,&quot; Sage said, &quot;as Cable hasn&#39;t been 
entirely forthcoming about it, but for at least the past twenty years. 
During that time,&quot; she got back to the lecture, &quot;he fostered 
international conflicts, trying to generate an era where discord and 
strife would rule.&quot;

        Bishop nodded, &quot;I seem to recall he did some arms dealing, a 
few assassinations and other similar activities, right?&quot;

        &quot;Correct,&quot; Sage nodded, &quot;but it seems that wasn&#39;t enough for 
him. Deciding to take a more active role, Stryfe took up his familiar 
suit of armor and began to operate publicly, creating the Mutant 
Liberation Front.&quot;

        &quot;Which is when we began to be aware of him,&quot; Elizabeth nodded 
thoughtfully.

        Sage continued, &quot;He appeared purely to be a small time 
operator at first, an impression that I&#39;m sure he quite deliberately 
fostered. It wasn&#39;t until he disguised himself as Cable and shot 
Professor Xavier with a techno-organic bullet that we began to see 
what he was capable of. He them went on to early slay Apocalypse, 
kidnap Scott and Jean, and turn the x- teams against each other.&quot;

        &quot;The X-Men went after X-Force,&quot; Neal murmured, &quot;since X-Force 
was tied to Cable.&quot;

        &quot;Cable and Stryfe battled each other in Apocalypse&#39;s Moon 
base, and they both appeared to have been destroyed there. But some 
time later Cable returned from the far future, and there was an 
unconfirmed report that Stryfe had somehow hid himself within Cable&#39;s 
mind. It&#39;s confirmed that he physically appeared to battle both Cable 
and the X-Man, as well as his attempt to reactivate the Prime 
Sentinels,&quot; Sage finished.

        Heather leaned forward in her seat, her expression troubled as 
she asked the group, &quot;So what, exactly, does he want?&quot;

        &quot;He started out simply seeking vengeance, but his desires have 
grown,&quot; Ororo said softly, &quot;now he wants to not only destroy Xavier&#39;s 
dream, but also each and every dreamer.&quot;

        There was a long moment of silence in the room as everyone 
tried to digest that. Finally Kitty spoke up firmly, &quot;That&#39;s something 
I will not let him do.&quot;

        Rogue put her hand on her lover&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I&#39;ll second 
that.&quot;

        All around the room, there was a general nodding of heads. 
Even Raven and Heather, their two newest teammates, seemed to be 
caught up in what was happening.

        Raven took Ororo&#39;s hand in hers and then gave it a gentle 
squeeze before asking, &quot;So what do we do now, love?&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll contact the school, let the Professor know that Stryfe 
is active again. He and Jean can also try to use Cerebra to see if 
they can find him,&quot; Ororo answered.

        &quot;When I talked to Pete Wisdom,&quot; Kitty murmured, &quot;he said there 
were a lot of nasty things going on, all traceable to Sakura. Sage, 
could you help me try to see if there&#39;s any pattern to what&#39;s been 
happening?&quot; Once Sage nodded her agreement Kitty turned to Bishop and 
asked him, &quot;Can you check into the police files, too?&quot;

        &quot;No problem,&quot; Bishop smiled, &quot;I&#39;ll call up Cat, we&#39;ll get 
right to it.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll go to my intelligence sources,&quot; Elizabeth volunteered 
before Kitty could ask her, &quot;pass around the image we got of Sakura.&quot;

        &quot;Now comes the hard part,&quot; Neal murmured as the others left 
the room.

        &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Heather asked him curiously.

        With a wry smile on his face Neal said, &quot;Now we all get to 
wait around to see what the bad guys are going to do next.&quot;

        Out in an abandoned town in the wilds of the Australian 
outback, two young woman stood at the edge of the battered wooden 
buildings. &quot;Ready?&quot; Polaris asked her companion.

        Plasma nodded, saying simply, &quot;Go.&quot;

        Polaris hurled the silvery disks in the air, and with fearsome 
accuracy Plasma cut them down, leaving puddles of molten metal in 
their wake.

        &quot;Well, your hit ratio certainly has improved,&quot; Polaris started 
out encouragingly, &quot;but...&quot;

        Plasma sighed, &quot;I was supposed to just generate enough energy 
to knock them out of the sky, not completely destroy them.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll try it again,&quot; Polaris floated over another set of 
disks.

        &quot;Lorna, I can&#39;t do this,&quot; the brown haired woman growled.

        &quot;Yes, you can,&quot; Polaris answered her intensely. She met 
Plasma&#39;s eyes, &quot;Just think about this, one day you&#39;re going to have to 
get information from your father&#39;s troops. That means your going to 
have to take them alive!&quot;

        They stood there eye to eye for a moment, and for a second it 
was like a spark passed between the two of them. Finally Plasma softly 
said, &quot;Send the disks flying again.&quot;

        And so they began again.

        &quot;Very interesting,&quot; Stryfe noted as he shut down the view 
screen. The armored figure leaned back on his chair, he had been 
considering asking Sakura to take up the fine tuning the powers of his 
various agents, but it seemed Polaris was already doing so.

        Sakura herself paced into the room as soon as he summoned her, 
her eye just a bit wary. &quot;You called, m&#39;lord?&quot; the white haired woman 
asked.

        &quot;You are aware that Polaris has taken up the training of 
Plasma?&quot; he asked.

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; Sakura said, &quot;I helped arrange for that myself.&quot;

        Stryfe frowned slightly, &quot;Explain.&quot;

        &quot;Polaris&#39; search for her lover Havok will only bring her so 
far,&quot; Sakura said calmly. &quot;But with the strong bond forming between 
them, we will be able to use one as leverage against the other if 
needed,&quot; she stated it all quite simply.

        Stryfe smiled slightly, &quot;As planned.&quot;

        &quot;On our mission to the island McCoy and Feral were also 
showing the chemistry that you told me to expect,&quot; she noted.

        &quot;Let&#39;s check on them,&quot; Stryfe activated another viewer. He 
stopped, and a slight smile appeared on his face, &quot;It seems that 
things have progressed farther than we had anticipated.&quot;

        Sakura brought the image up on another screen and chuckled, 
seeing the two of them so... busy, atop Feral&#39;s bed. &quot;I wonder what 
fur the cubs would be,&quot; she said dryly.

        &quot;McCoy could probably tell you,&quot; Stryfe noted as he 
deactivated the view screen and leaned back in his seat.

        &quot;Is he making sufficient progress in mapping out your and Nate 
Grey&#39;s genetic structure?&quot; she asked, the threat to the furry mutant 
all in the undertones.

        &quot;He&#39;s making good progress,&quot; Stryfe reassured his deadly chief 
assassin. Softly he added, &quot;There are only a series of small 
differences that he has discovered so far, but in combination those 
may be quite significant.&quot;

        &#39;As long as those aren&#39;t just genetic drift from cloning,&#39; 
Sakura thought, but she was careful to screen that thought away. Aloud 
she asked him, &quot;When will you command him to perform the enhancement 
on you?&quot;

        Stryfe gave her a stern glance, and the assassin took a half 
step backward. &quot;Remember your place,&quot; he reminded her softly.

        &quot;Yes, m&#39;lord,&quot; Sakura bowed to him submissively.
