<pre>        &#147;Pass the peas.&#148; Ginny stated as she glanced to her brothers, 
Ron looked at her for a split second before he returned his attention 
to Fred and George. 

         &#147;I swear you should have seem the looks in their eyes when 
Harry caught the snitch last week, it was bloody hilarious!&#148; Roared 
Fred as he slammed his fork down on the table causing a few stares 
from people around him, Harry looked up as he sipped on a bit of 
pumpkin juice before he spoke.

         &#147;It wasn&#146;t all that funny, I mean, well yeah I guess it was 
pretty good then the other Seeker ran slap into their Keeper.&#148; Chimed 
the black haired boy with an air of pride around him, groaning Ginny 
brushed back a long strand of red hair and rolled her eyes.

         &#147;Could someone please pass me the peas?&#148; Her voice strained 
to remain calm and polite, slowly Fred turned to look at his little 
sister with a small frown on his face that told her to keep it down or 
else. Groaning slightly louder Ginny pushed her plate in front of her 
and glared at the group of boys with venom in her pretty brown eyes.

         &#147;Could someone pass the carrots?&#148; Hermione asked with her 
nose buried deep in a book on transfiguration, without a second 
thought or missing a beat in the conversation that he was taking part 
in Ron slid the bowl with baby carrots next to the prudent brunette, 
Ginny suddenly felt her face go red with anger as she looked at her 
older brother Ron who was ignoring her. 

         &#147;Fine!&#148; Shouted Ginny as she stood up from the table and 
stamped out of the dinning hall causing everyone to look at the 
youngest Weasley confusedly, after a few minutes Harry spoke up in a 
quite voice.

         &#147;Could someone pass the peas?&#148; Harry asked as he looked up 
and down the table for the green spheres, George and Fred looked at 
each other then to the black haired Seeker.

         &#147;But Harry there aren&#146;t any peas.&#148; Stated Fred and George in 
unison while laughing, sighing heavily the black haired Gryffindor 
turned to his left to see Hermione look around perplexedly.

         &#147;Where&#146;s Ginny?&#148; Hermione asked as she put her book down and 
started to pile up carrots onto her plate, Harry shrugged as he took a 
bite of a dinner roll. 

         &#147;She huffed off because no one would pass her the peas.&#148; 
Stated Fred as he grabbed a piece of chicken off of George&#146;s plate; 
the messy haired brunette raised a slender eyebrow. 

         &#147;But there isn&#146;t any peas.&#148; Matter-of-factly declared 
Hermione as she took a sip of water from her cup.

         &#147;Would everyone just shut up about the bloody peas already!&#148; 
Yelled Ron as he melodramatically smacked his forehead against the 
table over and over again while chuckling softly under his breath, all 
in turn the Gryffindor table began to erupt in laughter; all except 
Hermione who thought the whole matter was absurd so she started to 
read her transfiguration book again. 

------------------------------------------------------------

         As Ginny walked down a long hallway that lead to the library 
she heard her stomach all to clearly growl with hunger, sighing 
inwardly the longhaired redhead folded the arms of her robes over her 
abdomen to try and ease the steady pains that were suddenly gnawing at 
her insides. This morning she had skipped breakfast altogether and she 
had only eaten an apple for lunch, simply because she was too busy 
with her studies to bother with eating. But now that all of her 
homework was done and she was certain that she had studied enough for 
her herbology test, Ginny suddenly remember how tired and hungry she 
indeed was. Taking slow steps to the library the redheaded Gryffindor 
stopped every so often to wince as a low grumble cried out from her 
stomach, just as she was about to enter the library Ginny stopped 
short and turned around briskly walking to the Gryffindor dormitories 
because the sudden notion of how rude it would be to the other 
students if her stomach growled and interrupted their learning. 

         As the fiery haired girl rounded a corner she unexpectedly 
crashed into a dark figure knocking them to the floor, flushing 
profusely Ginny scrambled back onto her feet and rushed over to the 
prone form of the fallen person she so carelessly bumped into. 

         &#147;I&#146;m so very sorry!&#148; Exclaimed Ginny as she reached down and 
took the person&#146;s hand and helped them up, the figure brushed off 
their robe and coyly bent down and picked of a thick book from the 
floor.

         &#147;Ginny,&#148; A soft feminine voice started with a long drawl as 
if the person was thinking of the right thing to say. &#147;I was wondering 
where you ran off to.&#148; The speaker stated and stepped into the dim 
light of the hallway, Ginny looked at her feet and fiddled with the 
sleeves of her robes.

         &#147;I&#146;m really sorry Hermione, I didn&#146;t see you.&#148; Stated the 
redhead as she slowly looked up just as her stomach gave a loud growl, 
raising a slender brow Hermione tucked her book under her arm and 
moved closer to Ginny with a look of utter seriousness in her eyes.

         &#147;Gin, are you okay?&#148; Inquired the brunette as she reached out 
and patted the younger girl on the shoulder, Ginny smiled softly and 
nodded.

         &#147;Yeah I am fine, I&#146;ve just been really busy with schoolwork 
lately. Nothing to worry about Mione.&#148; Declared the younger girl as 
she looked at Hermione but for some reason couldn&#146;t meet her eyes, 
frowning lightly the messy haired girl bent her head so she was 
staring Ginny right in the face.

         &#147;I don&#146;t want to find out that you skipped a meal again, you 
really worry me when you don&#146;t eat. It isn&#146;t healthy.&#148; Murmured 
Hermione softly as her voice took on a deep tone of concern, Ginny 
felt helpless as she looked into her friend&#146;s eyes unable to turn away 
from her; a prickle of heat slowly began to raise up onto Ginny&#146;s pale 
cheeks as Hermione&#146;s face hovered inches away from her own. 

         &#147;O-o-o-okay,&#148; Stammered the redhead as she nodded numbly from 
being chastised by her friend. &#147;I u-u-u-under s-s-s-stand.&#148; Ginny 
stated in a shallow voice that almost cracked when she finished her 
sentence, Hermione continued to frown lightly as she moved even closer 
to the younger girl.

         &#147;Please promise me you won&#146;t miss a meal again.&#148; Pleaded the 
brunette as she stared at the redheaded girl in front of her, Ginny 
fumbled with her robes again before she spoke in a hushed tone.

         &#147;I promise.&#148; She squeaked and looked down while flushing 
across the bridge of her nose all the way over to her cheeks, Hermione 
smiled lightly and gave Ginny a one armed hug due to the fact she 
still had a book under the other arm. Ginny gently snuzzled against 
the older girl&#146;s shoulder for a moment before Hermione let go of her 
and took a step back to look into her eyes again.

         &#147;Would you like to accompany me to the library to return this 
book, it&#146;s a good read if you like transfiguration.&#148; Offered the 
brunette in a sweet voice that wasn&#146;t her normal domineering 
know-it-all tone, Ginny found herself smiling and shaking her head yes 
before Hermione even finished her sentence.

         &#147;Sure, but after words I have to go straight to bed. I have a 
big test in herbology tomorrow.&#148; Ginny concluded with a sigh of almost 
relief, Hermione&#146;s brow wrinkled for a moment in thought before she 
spoke.

         &#147;Well why don&#146;t you just go on to bed, I am almost certain 
that I will want to go look at a few books I&#146;ve had my eye on all 
week. I wouldn&#146;t want to have you getting a bad mark on my behalf, now 
would I?&#148; Rhetorically inquired the messy haired brunette as she gave 
a half smile to Ginny; the young redheaded girl smirked impishly while 
brushing a tress behind her ear and nodding. 

         &#147;Well&#133;if I do get a bad mark&#133;will you tutor me?&#148; Breathed 
Ginny as she looked at the floor embarrassedly excepting the other 
girl to get irritated at her, a soft giggle escaped from Hermione&#146;s 
mouth as she looked at the younger Gryffindor girl with admiration 
glinting in her eyes.

         &#147;It would be a pleasure Gin, in fact lets begin your first 
tutoring session tomorrow at breakfast.&#148; Giddily announced Hermione as 
she clasped her hands together in front of her chest, Ginny giggled 
and mimicked the older girl&#146;s gesture. 

         &#147;Do you really mean it,&#148; The redheaded girl asked with hope 
shimmering in her pretty brown orbs, the older girl nodded and beamed 
a happy smirk in answer to Ginny&#146;s question. &#147;Oh, you&#146;re the best 
Hermione!&#148; Ginny chirped in an enthralled tone as she practically 
leapt at the older girl wrapping her arms around her neck and giving 
her a tight hug and nuzzled the crook of her neck, blushing slightly 
the prudent Gryffindor girl rested her cheek against the younger 
girl&#146;s head and sighed. 

         &#147;I&#146;ll catch you later then, bye Ginny.&#148; Rambled Hermione as 
she parted from the younger girl suddenly and rushed off to the 
library, standing in the hallway the fair skinned redhead raised a 
brow and slowly turned to go to the dormitories, as she walked Ginny 
could feel her heart beat faster and faster as she relished in the 
fact of how good it felt to have such a wonderful friend like Hermione 
Granger. 

         As the youngest of the Weasley children entered the common 
room her stomach gave a low growl that made her insides twist tightly 
together, stifling a sob that was suddenly welling up in the back of 
her throat Ginny headed up to the sleeping quarters before she could 
let out another whimper of hungry pains. Sniffling loudly the fiery 
haired fifth year crawled into her four-post bed and snuggled down in 
her blanks wishing more than anything for her tummy to stop its 
constant growling as she drifted off to sleep.

         As the night skies just began to turn lighter shade of black 
and a thick mist was beginning to settle gently on the dying blades of 
grass, a dark figure crept down the hallway to the fifth year 
Gryffindor girls&#146; room.

         &#147;Ginny?&#148; A voice suddenly whispered as a person pushed open 
the door to the girl&#146;s bedrooms, with a small jump the redhead 
stiffened as if she was dead. 

         &#147;H-H-Hermione?&#148; Ginny bellowed in a soft stutter as she 
pushed herself up on her elbows, staggering the messy haired brunette 
pushed the privacy curtains away and slipped onto the edge of the 
younger girl&#146;s bed. 

         &#147;Shush, yes it is me.&#148; Hermione murmured softly as she 
re-closed the silky curtains and slowly turned to face the pale 
redhead that was lying in the bed, Ginny looked at the older girl with 
tired brown eyes that had a hard time focusing in on the brunette&#146;s 
face. Though it was dark the young girl could still hear something was 
wrong with Hermione even if she couldn&#146;t see the other girl&#146;s face, 
suddenly feeling light tugs at her covers Ginny released the blankets 
from her grasp, confusedly she just continued to stare at Hermione 
through the darkness that somehow separated the two. 

         &#147;Mione&#133;what&#146;s wrong? Why are you here so late&#133;why are you 
here period?&#148; Ginny asked as she felt the older girl crawling up the 
bed and finally lay down on her right side mere millimeters away from 
her own body, then Hermione reached out and brought her into a light 
hug. 

         &#147;I don&#146;t want to be alone tonight. Please let me sleep with 
you, just for tonight.&#148; Begged the prudent Gryffindor girl as she 
snuzzled the smaller girl in her arms, Ginny felt her face flush beet 
red as the whole idea of Hermione spending the night in her bed made 
her excited. 

         &#147;I don&#146;t mind&#133;in fact why don&#146;t you get under the covers with 
me so you will be more comfortable.&#148; Ginny murmured softly as she 
reached down and pulled the blanket up and covered them both, smiling 
Hermione pulled the younger girl closer to her body and rested her 
cheek on her shoulder. 

         &#147;Thank you Ginny, you don&#146;t know how much this means to me.&#148; 
Breathed the taller girl in a low voice that lightly tickled the ear 
of the pale red haired Gryffindor laying beside her, shivering lightly 
Ginny snuggled closer to her older friend causing the brunette to take 
in a sudden gasp. 

         &#147;What&#146;s wrong Hermione, did I do something?&#148; Ginny asked as 
she pushed herself away from the other girl with fear blazing in her 
brown eyes, shaking her head the prudent brunette managed a few words 
before she reached out and brought the younger girl back against her 
thin frame. 

         &#147;N-n-n-no, you didn&#146;t do anything at all, just hold me. 
Please Ginny, I need you to hold me.&#148; Begged Hermione in a soft voice, 
Ginny blinked slightly confusedly but did as the messy haired 
Gryffindor wanted her to do. 

         &#147;Hermione,&#148; Uttered the smaller girl as she wrapped her arms 
around the brunette&#146;s waist, barely lifting her head from the younger 
girl&#146;s shoulder so she could look at the flaming haired Weasley, the 
prudent know-it-all gazed up into Ginny&#146;s eyes. &#147;I was just wondering, 
what do you think about me? I mean really think about me. Do you see 
me as just some little girl, some nosey child that just gets in the 
way?&#148; Ginny muttered coldly while never taking her eyes off of 
Hermione, blinking back a shocked look the brunette lifted herself 
onto her elbow so she was only a few millimeters away from the younger 
Gryffindor girl.

         &#147;Virginia Weasley, how could you ask me that? If only you 
knew what I really thought of you, of what I wanted to do to you, with 
you.&#148; Hermione&#146;s voice was suddenly low as if she were purring, for a 
second Ginny could feel Hermione&#146;s hand on her stomach before she felt 
it move lower, until it rested firmly on her thigh. Gasping at the 
unexpected action Ginny stiffened up as if dead. 

         &#147;W-w-w-w-w-w-w-what are you d-d-d-d-d-doing Hermione?&#148; The 
redhead stuttered while blushing a brighter shade of red than her 
hair, licking her lips the older girl moved forward slightly and 
suddenly straddled Ginny&#146;s hips. 

         &#147;I want you&#133;I&#146;ve always wanted you. Please let me have you 
Ginny, I can&#146;t go on another day if I don&#146;t get to feel you,&#148; Hermione 
stated in a sultry voice as she emphasized her meaning by grabbing the 
red haired girl&#146;s breast in each hand and squeezing them gently. 
&#147;Taste you. Take in every perfect inch of you with my eyes and mouth; 
please Ginny let me make love to you. Let me show you what I think of 
you.&#148; Pleaded the brunette as she rubbed the younger girl&#146;s chest, 
Ginny panted and moaned heavily before thoughts began to make sense in 
her mind again.

         &#147;Mione, please&#133;don&#146;t,&#148; Whispered the little redheaded girl as 
she arched her back off of her bed and placed her small hands on 
either side of Hermione&#146;s hips. &#147;Don&#146;t stop, please, please don&#146;t 
stop! I want you too, please god Hermione take me!&#148; Ginny yelped in a 
subtly scream as to not wake the other girl&#146;s in her room, on top of 
her the messy haired brunette smiled brightly and began to grind back 
and forth. Already in heaven Ginny arched her back more so she was 
thrusting harder into the older girl on top of her, the action caused 
a deep moan to escape Hermione&#146;s lips as she was now literally riding 
the girl below her. 

         &#147;Oh, Ginny&#133;just a little bit more&#133;a little harder. God yes!&#148; 
Hermione panted and grinded her hips as hard as she could against the 
red haired girl, suddenly Ginny felt a flood of wetness spill onto 
panties from the messy haired girl on top of her, smiling weakly 
Hermione started to slip down Ginny&#146;s petite frame until her face was 
mere moments from the girl&#146;s private area. 

         &#147;Oh Mione, what are you doing&#133;I was so close.&#148; Pouted Ginny 
in disappointment at the loss of pleasure, looking up with passion 
burning in her eyes Hermione smiled and slowly lowered her head to the 
young redhead&#146;s panty waist, taking the edge of the soaked fabric 
between her teeth the brunette clumsily slipped the garment off so 
Ginny was only half clothed. 

         &#147;I said I wanted to taste you.&#148; Hermione licked her lips and 
slowly spread the younger girl&#146;s thighs apart, Ginny shivered from 
excitement and anticipation as she waited to see what the older girl 
was going to do. Hermione smiled and gently placed kisses on the 
insides of Ginny&#146;s thighs, and slowly replaced the kisses with 
delicate warm wet licks that slid all the way to her upper inner thigh 
but fell short of reaching her womanhood. Moaning loudly Ginny began 
to raise her hips off of the bed again, Hermione smirked lightly and 
rewarded the red manned girl with one long probing lick squarely 
placed on her labia. Ginny moaned deeply and worked her fingers into 
Hermione&#146;s tangled tresses, gently the red haired Gryffindor pushed 
down on the girl&#146;s head and rocked her hips up and down with need. 
Taking shorter licks Hermione worked her tongue in and out of Ginny&#146;s 
wet womanhood while her thumb found her clit and rubbed it in circular 
motions, in mere moments of the action Ginny&#146;s small body bucked 
wildly as she exploded with release.

         &#147;HERMIONE!!!&#148; Ginny screamed and bolted straight up with 
sweat dripping down her brow, smiling the redheaded girl looked at the 
source that was giving her pleasure but suddenly felt her stomach knot 
up as she pulled her hand from out of her panties, with sad 
realization it was all just another dream. In fact it was the third 
one that month and Ginny&#146;s cheeks flared crimson with shame as tried 
to push the lingering fantasy from her head but just couldn&#146;t manage 
to shake the dream. Of course the redheaded Gryffindor always felt 
guilty whenever she had those types of dreams about Hermione which 
always lead the youngest of the Weasley&#146;s to avoid the prudent 
brunette for a few days after words, but the dreams were becoming more 
and more realistic every time she had them and sometimes she could 
swear they weren&#146;t dreams at all. 

         Tiredly pushing herself up into a sitting position Ginny 
looked at her still very damp hand, and suddenly gave a loud gasp that 
caused several girls&#146;s to stir as she stared as blood dripped from her 
fingertips and onto her bed sheets. The small fiery haired girl shot 
from her bed and hurriedly threw on her school robes, fear glinted in 
her brown eyes as she ran down stairs still in her bare feet not 
caring if the floors were as cold as ice. It was still very early in 
the morning and hardly any students were up yet, but Ginny prayed 
Madam Pomfrey was awake; the one thought that pounded through her 
buzzing head as she rounded the common room and came to the exit was 
&#145;I&#146;m going to bleed to death! Oh dear Merlin I am going to bloody 
bleed to death!&#146; as the picture of the Fat Lady swung open Ginny ran 
from the room just as Hermione Granger rubbed sleep from her eyes and 
barely caught a fleeting glimpse of red hair and black robes. 

         &#147;What in the world?&#148; Murmured the brunette out loud as she 
instinctively knew she should follow her younger friend, as quickly as 
her feet could carry her Hermione followed suit after the smaller girl 
who was already a great deal ahead of her. By the sixth corridor the 
messy haired brunette was panting heavily as she began to grow tired 
of chasing the young Weasley, but just as Hermione was prepared to 
stop and take a rest she heard Ginny&#146;s voice squeak in panic. 

         &#147;I&#146;m sorry, so sorry, I don&#146;t know what is wrong please make 
the bleeding stop, I didn&#146;t mean to, please Madam Pomfrey help me!&#148; 
Ginny yelled and broke down into loud sobs, gasping at the amount of 
blood that was covering her hand and now the bottom parts of her robes 
Madam Pomfrey ushered the flaming redhead into the hospital wing, 
Hermione&#146;s heart skipped a beat at the mention of the would &#145;blood&#146; 
and she slowly entered the room and hid behind a privacy curtain so 
she could hear everything that was being said. 

         &#147;Goodness be Miss Weasley what in the name of Hogwarts did 
you do?&#148; Pomfrey asked while still in shock, Ginny was gasping for air 
as she started to ball harder and begin to hiccup.

         &#147;I was having a&#133;a&#133;d-d-d-d-d-d-dream and when I w-w-woke up I 
was covered in blood!&#148; Yelped the redhead as panic took hold of her 
again; Madam Pomfrey&#146;s brow wrinkled for a moment before she lowered 
her voice so that Hermione had to strain to hear what she was about to 
say.

         &#147;Do you know what menstruations are?&#148; Pomfrey asked, as she 
looked at Ginny with concerned eyes, Ginny just looked at the nurse 
stupidly because after all she was bleeding to death and the old crone 
was asking her 101 bloody questions. 

         &#147;No, I don&#146;t know what &#145;men stations&#146; are? Why would I care, 
I AM BLEEDING TO DEATH AND I DON&#146;T WISH TO THINK ABOUT MEN AND THERE 
STATIONS AT THIS MOMENT!&#148; Screamed Ginny as she franticly waved her 
bloody hand in the air slinging clots of thick dark crimson against 
the wall and bed, some even landed on the curtain Hermione was hiding 
behind making the tall brunette&#146;s stomach twist as the red seeped 
through the fabric. 

         &#147;Virginia Weasley please calm yourself! After this is all 
over I am going to have a stern talking to that mother of yours, 
sending a girl to Hogwarts not even knowing what a period is! I&#146;ve 
never heard such a thing before, Virginia look at me and calm down. 
What is happening right now is perfectly normal; in fact I am sort of 
surprised you haven&#146;t had one before now. Anyways, you are having a 
period otherwise known as menstruations, it is when an egg&#133;&#148; Pomfrey 
said but was cut off by a still very hysterical Ginny Weasley. 

         &#147;An egg!? What does my bleeding to death have to do with an 
egg&#133;AND HOW IS THIS NORMAL!?!?!&#148; Ginny shrieked and started to turn an 
unusual shade of white, Madam Pomfrey sighed and was highly tempted to 
send Mrs. Weasley a howler for her lack of teaching her daughter 
anything about being a woman. 

         &#147;Calm down before a make you silent Miss Weasley! Yes, yes an 
egg, all women have eggs inside of them as men have sperm! Now let me 
finish! A period is when an egg that is produced by your ovaries is 
released and isn&#146;t fertilized by a sperm,&#148; Madam Pomfrey explained 
while Ginny took on a look of complete and utter confusion. &#147;So this 
egg that wasn&#146;t fertilized is what all that blood is. Understand?&#148; 

         Ginny shook her head yes, then no then yes again, but finally 
started to cry as she held her stomach and shook her head no over and 
over again, Madam Pomfrey sighed and patted the poor innocent girl on 
the shoulder.

         &#147;I don&#146;t understand a word you just said, men have theses 
things inside them called &#145;sperm&#146; and women have &#145;eggs&#146;, I&#146;m not a 
chicken Madam Pomfrey why do I have an egg?&#148; 

         &#147;Because dear that is how we make babies.&#148; Pomfrey stated as 
she decided a howler was just what Mrs. Weasley needed to teacher her 
a lesson, Ginny held her stomach more and began to whine miserably. 

         &#147;Okay, okay fine I have an egg to make babies, but how do you 
make it stop bleeding, and why does it hurt?&#148; Whimpered the redhead as 
she looked at the older woman with tears clinging to her long 
eyelashes. 

         &#147;Oh dear me&#133;.&#148; Pomfrey groaned as she realized she would need 
to tell Ginny how to use a tampon, behind the curtain Hermione didn&#146;t 
know whether to laugh or cry because she could only imagine how hard 
this was for little Ginny much less poor Madam Pomfrey who was trying 
her best to explain years worth of unknown knowledge to the scared 
girl. 

         &#147;Well?!&#148; Barked Ginny who was crying harder and hiccupping 
every few seconds.

         &#147;It is called cramps Virginia that is what is hurting, and as 
for stopping the bleeding. It goes away on its own, in about five to 
seven days&#133;&#148; Again she was cut off by a raving Ginny.

         &#147;I AM GOING TO BLEED TO DEATH!!!!&#148; Shouted the red haired 
girl as she turned stark white and began to shake violently with sobs.

         &#147;YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BLEED TO DEATH YOU SILLY GIRL NOW HUSH 
WHILE I EXPLANE!&#148; Pomfrey yelled which make Ginny suddenly shut her 
mouth and stare at the woman blankly. &#147;Good. Now as I was saying, you 
will have a period for five to seven days and in those days you will 
use&#133;an absorption device to keep you from bleeding everywhere. There 
are two kinds of things you can use, a pad and a tampon, I suggest 
using a pad because it will be easier for you, but tampons are more 
comfortable and practical.&#148; 

         Ginny nodded and her hiccups died away leaving her pale and 
very tired.

         &#147;How do I use them?&#148; Ginny asked honestly and kept her voice 
level and almost shy like, Madam Pomfrey sighed.

         &#147;When you use a pad you simply place it in your knickers, it 
has an adhesive side that makes it stick to the cloth so it doesn&#146;t 
move around. A tampon is&#133;a bit different. You see, you put it inside 
of your vagina so it soaks up the blood before it has a chance to leak 
everywhere.&#148; Stated Madam Pomfrey as she expected the redhead to 
scream about having to put something inside of her privates, instead 
Ginny just looked at the woman and turned a odd colour of white as her 
mouth just barely hung open. 

         &#147;I think I am going to be sick.&#148; 

         &#147;It&#146;s alright dear you just lay down and rest a bit, I will 
inform your teachers that you won&#146;t becoming to classes today.&#148; 
Declared the older woman and slowly walked off towards her office to 
write several messages to Ginny&#146;s teachers as well as one highly vocal 
one to Mrs. Weasley. Feeling her stomach lurch forward Ginny began to 
weep again in thought that she wouldn&#146;t be able to take her herbology 
test today or see Hermione. 

         &#147;Bugger, I&#146;m even starting to think like her. Wanting to take 
a test when I am going to be bleeding like a stuck cow for a week.&#148; 
Murmured Ginny as she covered herself up and laid in the little white 
bed not taken notice to either the large blood spot that was suddenly 
spreading on the sheets or the messy haired brunette that was slowly 
walking over to the bed. 

         &#147;Starting to even think like me huh? Well that doesn&#146;t sound 
half as bad as you are making out to be.&#148; Chortled Hermione as she 
looked down at the flaming haired girl, blushing for a brief moment 
before her cheeks turned two shades paler than what they were before 
she flushed Ginny stared at Hermione with a hurt gaze. 

         &#147;Go away. Please just leave me alone, I&#146;m not in the mood to 
talk.&#148; Whispered Ginny as she darted her brown eyes away from the 
other girl&#146;s face guiltily, Hermione blinked confusedly for a moment 
before she reached out and tenderly patted the younger Gryffindor on 
the shoulder.

         &#147;It&#146;s okay Gin, I know what you are going through, I do it 
too you know. Like clockwork.&#148; Hermione fumbled for the right choice 
of words and realized she had said exactly the wrong thing to say, 
Ginny slapped the older girl&#146;s hand away with a forceful smack and 
leered at her through narrowed eyes.

         &#147;Get out, GET OUT NOW!&#148; Ginny screamed as a new wave of tears 
began to cascade down her cheeks, confusion set in on Hermione&#146;s face 
as she backed away from the younger girl&#146;s bed. The sudden wounded 
look on the brunette&#146;s face tore Ginny&#146;s heart in two as Hermione 
turned on her heels and scramble out of the hospital wing.  

------------------------------------------------------------

         &#147;So she finally got the curse?&#148; Ron asked as he stuffed a 
piece of bacon into his mouth while George and Fred cackled with 
laughter, Hermione folded her arms over her chest in disapproval. 

         &#147;Curse?&#148; Muttered Harry as he suddenly took on a look of 
concern, Ron brushed his long nose with the back of his hand.

         &#147;Yeah Harry, the &#145;Curse&#146;, you should even know about it. 
Muggles get it too.&#148; Stated Ron as he took a bit of orange juice, 
blinking for a moment the black haired Seeker thought about what kind 
of curse a muggle could get without the ministry of magic sending the 
people who cursed them to Azkaban.

         &#147;Oh they do,&#148; Harry stated still confused, suddenly a light 
clicked on in his head. &#147;OHHHHHHH! The women&#146;s &#145;Curse&#146;!&#148; Gasped the 
boy who lived in realization, this of course made the entire 
Gryffindor table burst out into fits of loud laughter, all of the 
Gryffindors except for Hermione Granger who was reaching for her wand 
to do some nasty cursing of her own.   

         &#147;So Weasley, your little sister is finally a woman. Best keep 
her locked up, because I don&#146;t want anymore of your kind running 
around. After all she is a bitch in heat now, right?&#148; Roared Draco 
Malfoy as he slinked up to the Gryffindor table with Crabbe and Goyle 
on either side of him, rage suddenly flared up into all of the 
Weasley&#146;s faces but the one person who was first to speak wasn&#146;t Ron 
nor George or Fred but Hermione Granger who had her wand poking 
roughly into the pale Slytherin&#146;s throat.

            
&#147;If&#133;you&#133;EVER&#133;speak&#133;of&#133;Ginny&#133;Weasley&#133;like&#133;that&#133;ever&#133;again&#133;you&#133; 
will&#133;find&#133;yourself&#133; wishing&#133;for&#133;a&#133;quick&#133;and&#133;painless&#133;death!!!&#148; 
Screamed the wild haired brunette as she shook with uncontrolled 
anger; her voice could have chilled even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to 
the very core of his dark heartless soul. Draco&#146;s face contorted and 
turned an unhealthy shade somewhere between white and green as he 
staggered backwards to escape the wraith of the insane muggle born. 

            &#147;Miss Granger!&#148; A loud and ominous voice boomed over the 
Great Hall, the owner of the voice was none other than Severus Snape 
the potions master and one of the must loathed teachers at Hogwarts. 
&#147;I will not have such a heinous threat to one of my students, One 
thousand points will be deducted from Gryffindor! And as for you Miss 
Granger follow me, I am sure Professor McGonagall will be most 
displeased with your actions.&#148; Snape said in a low dark tone that had 
a vague hint of giddiness to it, lowering her head with shame Hermione 
marched from the Great Hall, with each step the messy haired brunette 
began to acquire the mannerisms of a badly beaten puppy as Snape lead 
her down a long corridor and into Minerva McGonagall&#146;s office. 

         &#147;Miss Granger,&#148; McGonagall said with a long drawl. &#147;Professor 
Snape, what brings you two into my office so early?&#148; The deputy head 
mistress inquired as she looked from the tall black haired man to the 
cowering girl beside him, brushing back a strand of slick greasy hair 
Snape looked at McGonagall with a look of pure venom. 

         &#147;She threatened one of my students Minerva, she had her wand 
pressing so had against is throat I am surprised he doesn&#146;t need 
medical attention. I do belief this is grounds for expulsion.&#148; Snape 
stated with a soft smile on his lips, turning her eyes towards 
Hermione she could see the girl was in tears and highly upset.

         &#147;You may leave Severus, I wish to talk to Miss Granger 
alone.&#148; 

         With that Snape scowled and left the room melodramatically, 
his robes billowed up like a cape as he exited the room and slammed 
the door with a simple magic spell. 

         &#147;I&#146;ll start packing my things Professor.&#148; Whispered the 
brunette as she held out her wand and set it down in front of 
McGonagall on her desk, blinking back a confused look the 
Transfiguration teacher looked at Hermione before she lifted up the 
wand in her hands.

         &#147;Miss Granger, I have no reason to expel you from Hogwarts. 
Take back your wand,&#148; The older woman held her breath for a moment. 
&#147;But I am afraid that your behaviour has earned you a month&#146;s worth of 
detention, and I think it would be best if you were to take all of 
your meals in your room as further punishment.&#148; 

         &#147;For a full month, I have to eat in my room?&#148; Hermione 
whispered with melancholy with the thought of not being able to tutor 
Ginny that the very front of her mind, wiping her eyes on the corner 
of her robes Hermione nodded and took back her wand and slowly headed 
towards her first period class. 

------------------------------------------------------------

         &#147;Did you see the way Hermione handed Malfoy his arse on a 
silver plate, whoa I have never seen her get so mad before. It was 
like she was a different person, Harry I really don&#146;t like this.&#148; Ron 
Weasley stated in a ramble as he and the black haired Seeker rushed to 
their class, once inside the two Gryffindor boys settled into their 
seats. After a few moments Harry leaned into Ron making the red haired 
boy to fluster pink.

         &#147;Where&#146;s Hermione, the class is about to start. It isn&#146;t like 
her to be late.&#148; The young Seeker&#146;s voice was swallow and full of 
concern, brushing his nose with the point of his wand Ron looked at 
Harry and shrugged. 

         &#147;Maybe she is still being chewed out by old McGonagall, I&#146;d 
hate to find out Mione is getting suspended, could you see how she 
would take that. Bugger, I&#146;d really hate to see her if she is in deep 
trouble, you know how I can&#146;t stand to see her cry.&#148; Once again 
rambled the lanky redhead; pushing his round glasses up the bridge of 
his nose the Boy Who Lived cased his vision to the class door just as 
a disheveled Hermione walked in and hurriedly took her seat beside Ron 
and Harry. The two boys exchanged glances before they heard the 
brunette mutter something under her breath.

         &#147;Leave me alone, okay? I don&#146;t want to talk to anyone right 
now.&#148; She breathed and cracked open the wrong book and began to read 
it without notice, Ron laid his head down on his arms and wished he 
knew a good vanishing spell because seeing Hermione in such a foal 
mood was quickly getting on his last nerve. 

         Halfway into the class a soft sniffling sound began to 
disturb several people as they tried to listen to Professor Lupin, 
looking up from his book that he was momentarily reading from Remus 
Lupin teacher of Protection Against the Dark Arts stood at the front 
of the class and scanned to see who was making the soft racket. 

         &#147;Miss Granger, are you alright? Do you need to go to the 
nurse?&#148; Remus softly murmured, as he looked at the prudent brunette 
with concern in his pretty amber eyes, Hermione nodded and scooped up 
her books and rushed out of the class so quickly that she nearly fell 
before she reached the door. Leaning in to Ron again Harry spoke in a 
low simmer of a voice.

         &#147;I think some is really wrong with Hermione, we better find 
out what it is before she ends up regretting it.&#148; 

         Ron nodded numbly at what the black haired boy beside him 
said, in the pit of his stomach Ronald Weasley could feel his insides 
twist with a feeling something very bad was about to happen. 

         &#147;Pop quiz time.&#148; Professor Lupin chimed with glee as he 
pulled out rolls of parchments, at this point the red haired 
Gryffindor boy seriously was beginning to think he might possible be 
clairvoyant. 

------------------------------------------------------------

         Elsewhere in the castle Hermione Granger was slowly making 
her way towards the hospital wing of Hogwarts, as the brunette dragged 
her feet up a few flights of steps she managed all of her will power 
to head straight up to Madam Pomfrey.

         &#147;I&#146;m sick.&#148; Hermione stated lamely as she looked at the floor 
slightly startling the old nurse at her suddenness.

         &#147;And what are you &#145;sick&#146; with Miss Granger?&#148; Pomfrey asked as 
she looked at the Gryffindor girl, seeing tears still run down her 
cheeks Madam Pomfrey silently ushered the brunette in a free bed. 

         &#147;I don&#146;t know&#133;I feel hot all over&#133;and my head keeps 
spinning.&#148; Whispered the prudent girl as she sat down on the edge of 
the offered bed, sighing Pomfrey placed her hand on the brunette&#146;s 
forehead and made a few disapproving grunting noises before she spoke 
again. 

         &#147;You do have a fever, and the symptoms you are describing can 
only be one thing. Influenza, I think that you should just lay down 
for a bit will I whip up something to make you feel better.&#148; And with 
that Madam Pomfrey was scurrying around in the back of the hospital 
wing looking for potions of sorts, laying her head down on the soft 
pillow behind her Hermione sighed and started to cry once again.

         &#147;Mione?&#148; A soft voice muttered almost weakly from beside the 
tall brunette, jerking her head to the source of the speaker Hermione 
could barely make out the shadow of Ginny Weasley in the bed next over 
to her.

         &#147;Yes it&#146;s me&#133;are you feeling better Gin?&#148; Hermione whispered 
lightly as she propped herself back up to look at the other girl&#146;s 
direction better, a low whimper answered her question but the 
redheaded girl behind the curtain spoke anyways.

         &#147;I am feeling better&#133;but I have got to tell you something. I 
am so sorry for yelling at you this morning, I was just really upset 
and I didn&#146;t really know what I was saying&#133;god Hermione I am so sorry, 
please forgive me.&#148; Ginny begged and started to cry again for fear her 
friend would be mad at her, shaking her head Hermione swung her legs 
over the edge of her bed and slowly walked over to where the other 
girl was. 

         &#147;May I, come over there?&#148; Hermione asked in a low tone as she 
reached the curtain barrier, Ginny sat up and wiped at her eyes trying 
to make it appear that she hadn&#146;t been crying all day.

         &#147;Yes you may.&#148; Simply stated the smaller girl, within seconds 
Hermione moved the curtain aside and stepped over on to the other 
girl&#146;s bed area. 

         &#147;Ginny, I have something to tell you.&#148; Murmured the brunette 
as she fumbled with the sleeves of her robes. &#147;I can&#146;t tutor you, well 
not unless you want to spend the next month in my room eating with me. 
You see, I sort of got into a lot of trouble this morning.&#148; 

         &#147;How did you get in trouble?&#148; Ginny inquired with slight 
confusion, Hermione just sighed lightly and sat down on the edge of 
the younger girl&#146;s bed. 

         &#147;Well, you see, Madam Pomfrey told your brothers that 
you&#133;umm&#133;started today and she thought it would be more appropriate if 
one of them were to bring your assignments up to you at the end of the 
day. I guess she didn&#146;t think much about it because after all they are 
your brothers, but Fred and George sort of let it slip at the 
breakfast table about you and one thing lead to another and Malfoy 
said some horrible about you&#133;and I sort of lost it and almost did 
something very bad to him. I got one thousand house points taken away 
from Gryffindor and a month of detention. And as further punishment I 
am to eat in my room for the next month as well.&#148; 

         For some reason Ginny guessed as much would happen, after it 
is Fred and George after all, but hearing about how Hermione was being 
punished for protecting her just made her upset all over again.

         &#147;I am so sorry Mione, you shouldn&#146;t have stuck up for me&#133;I 
don&#146;t want you getting in trouble over me&#133;I&#146;m not worth getting in 
trouble over. Especially you, I mean you of all people shouldn&#146;t risk 
you clean record over me. I really am not worth it, not really worth 
anything at all, especially your record.&#148; Ginny murmured weakly while 
she kept her brown eyes focused on the floor, Hermione sat there in 
shock for what seemed like hours as she just stared at the red haired 
Gryffindor beside her. 

         &#147;Virginia Weasley! How could you say you aren&#146;t worth 
anything, I can&#146;t belief my ears! How could I not take up for you, I 
care about you Ginny, I care for you very much. And if there is one 
person I would gladly turn in my wand for it would be you!&#148; Hermione 
declared in a low shout slightly startling the small red haired girl, 
Ginny looked at Hermione with a trembling bottom lip that just made 
her look like she was bewitched with a cuteness charm of some sort. 

         &#147;You mean that?&#148; Ginny replied as her voice cracked lightly, 
Hermione nodded lightly and sat on the edge of the bed looking quit 
uncomfortable. 

         &#147;Ginny, can I tell you something&#133;but you have to promise not 
to be afraid, or tell anyone else.&#148; Hermione whispered in a low voice 
that was fearful, Ginny nodded and lightly placed her hand on the 
older Gryffindor&#146;s shoulder.

         &#147;I promise.&#148; 

         &#147;Well&#133;Ginny&#133;it&#146;s like this&#133;you see&#133;oh how to word this&#133;I&#146;m 
a&#133;umm&#133;what I mean to say is&#133;I don&#146;t like&#133;err this is hard. Ginny I 
think&#133;I think&#133;I might&#133;be&#133;.&#148;The last word fell short from leaving her 
mouth as Madam Pomfrey entered Hermione&#146;s empty bed and gave a 
displeased sound. 

         &#147;Miss Granger, there will be no visiting other students while 
you are in my care. Now back to your own bed this instant.&#148; Barked 
Madam Pomfrey as she pulled back Ginny&#146;s curtain to see Hermione 
sitting with the younger girl, shaking her head Pomfrey sat a bottle 
of some sort of thick red and blue liquid down in front of the two 
girls. &#147;Take every drop of this medicine and I might just let you and 
Miss Weasley here talk for a bit longer.&#148; Madam Pomfrey stated, 
letting out a low pitiful whimper Hermione slipped off of Ginny&#146;s bed 
and sneered at the bottle of liquid for a moment before she downed the 
whole thing in one chug, almost instantly the wild haired brunette 
shivered and let out a soft gag before she held her stomach. 

         &#147;Are you sure that stuff isn&#146;t supposed to make you sick? It 
tasted horrid, and my insides feel like they are on fire now.&#148; 

         At this the old nurse smiled lightly and walked off while 
saying something just loud enough for Hermione and Ginny to hear her 
clearly.

         &#147;That is how you know it works.&#148; Called the older woman and 
slowly headed back towards her office located on the other end of the 
hospital wing, leaving Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley alone. 

         &#147;Mione, do you still want to tell me your secrete?&#148; Quietly 
murmured the flaming haired girl, biting down on her bottom lip the 
prudent brunette sat back down on the younger girl&#146;s bed and took a 
deep breath.

         &#147;Ginny, what I was going to say&#133;was&#133;I think&#133;I might 
be&#133;g-g-g-gay.&#148; Hermione stuttered and blushed five shades darker than 
the colour of the younger girl&#146;s hair, sitting there Ginny just 
blinked confusedly while she looked at the older girl.

         &#147;I don&#146;t understand, what does it mean to be gay? Is it 
something bad?&#148; Ginny asked while Hermione just gawked at the younger 
girl in shock.

         &#147;You have to be joking. You honestly mean you don&#146;t know what 
it is to be gay,&#148; Hermione inquired while looked at the red haired 
girl beside her, Ginny nodded and continued to look at the messy 
haired Gryffindor girl confusedly. &#147;Ginny, being gay&#133;well as far as in 
the muggle world goes is bad. Being gay means, that you like someone 
that is the same gender as you. Lets say&#133;I liked you and umm you liked 
me&#133;and we were to go out with each other like Percy and that Ravenclaw 
girl did. That would mean we are gay, actually the correct word would 
be lesbians that is what they call two women would like each other. 
Have you ever heard of that, is it wrong to be gay in the wizardry 
world too?&#148; 

         Ginny took a long pause as she thought it over for a moment, 
she did remember her mother telling her something like this when she 
was at home last summer. Blushing Ginny smiled at Hermione sweet 
before she spoke. 

         &#147;My mum told me something about being &#145;gay&#146; as you call it, 
she said it was normal for girls our age to have feelings like that. 
But,&#148; Ginny&#146;s thoughts suddenly turned vile as she remember her mother 
telling her something else. &#147;Mum also said that girls grow out of it 
too, and it wasn&#146;t acceptable for two girls to be with each other 
longer than their school years. Hermione, I don&#146;t like boys, in 
fact&#133;I&#133;err&#133;sort&#133;of&#133;like you a lot.&#148; Ginny squeaked in a high-pitched 
voice as she flushed a deep shade of crimson. Slightly taken back the 
messy haired brunette looked at the younger Gryffindor.

         &#147;You mean that&#133;Ginny&#133;I like you a lot too&#133;does then mean you 
want to&#133;you know&#133;go out?&#148; Stammered the brunette as she kept her 
distance from the redhead, Ginny smiled and slowly began to move 
closer to Hermione.

         &#147;Yes,&#148; Murmured the petite Gryffindor as she quickly leaned 
in and kissed Hermione on the cheek. &#147;I am allowed to do that now, 
right?&#148; Ginny asked in a meek voice as she blushed more, nodded her 
head the tall brunette smiled and quickly returned the action with a 
light kiss of her own. Both girls blushed deeply and started into fits 
of giggles before Madam Pomfrey came back and informed Hermione that 
she could return to her afternoon classes. Ginny looked at Madam 
Pomfrey with hurt brown eyes and let her bottom lip tremble ever so 
slightly.

         &#147;Does she have to, she makes me feel better. Please let her 
stay until after lunch, please.&#148; Ginny begged as she managed to 
conjure up tears, sighing the nurse just muttered a &#145;okay&#146; and walked 
back to her office. 

         &#147;Your really good at that.&#148; Hermione stated as she wiped 
Ginny&#146;s fake tears off with her robe, beaming a happy smile the 
younger girl nodded. 

         &#147;You have to be when you live with Fred and George, if you 
don&#146;t cry then dad won&#146;t make them stop, come in very handy.&#148; Ginny 
declared mater-of-factly, Hermione smiled and hugged the smaller girl 
with affectionately.  

------------------------------------------------------------

         It was about dinnertime before Harry or Ron saw Hermione 
again and to their shock but very much also their relief she was 
practically skipping into the Great Hall to greet her two male 
friends.

         &#147;Hello Ron, Harry&#133;gosh it is a wonderful day. Well I can&#146;t 
talk I got to be getting to my dorm, punishment and all that you know. 
Bye.&#148; And just like that she rushed off leaving both Gryffindor boys 
standing at the house table with stupid looks on their faces. 

         &#147;Well,&#148; Ron said after he gathered some wit about him. &#147;At 
least she isn&#146;t crying anymore.&#148; 

         Harry nodded but still couldn&#146;t shake the feeling that 
something very big was about to happen.

         &#147;Right.&#148; Muttered the Seeker as he sat down and watched the 
food appear on the plates in front of him, this was just one of those 
days. 

         &#147;Oh bugger!&#148; Fred and George yelped together as a howler 
landed in front of them. &#147;I swear we didn&#146;t do anything to get one of 
these!&#148; Exclaimed the two in unison once again, but Ron looked at the 
red letter with a shocked look on his face.

         &#147;Well, well, well looks like it&#146;s for Ginny and by the way 
it&#146;s smoking mum is defiantly not happy with her.&#148; Ron smiled and 
looked at Fred and George who were thinking the same thing he was.

         &#147;Lets hid it until tomorrow, this should be worth losing all 
the house points!&#148; Exclaimed Fred as he smirked devilishly, some one 
at the far end of the table made a comment about how the Gryffindors 
were already in the negative numbers because of Hermione. Fred, 
George, and Ron smiled together as they placed the red howler into a 
book and burst out laughing. 

------------------------------------------------------------

         That morning Hermione and Ginny were sitting closely to each 
other pretending to read the same book as the rest of the Gryffindors 
headed down to the Great Hall for breakfast, stopping just as the 
portrait of Fat Lady swung open a certain redheaded Weasley by the 
name of Ron remembered the howler in George&#146;s Potion book. The thought 
of Ginny opening it later in the day made the lanky boy start to crack 
up and stagger out of the common room almost in tears he was laughing 
so hard. 

         &#147;I wonder what is up with him?&#148; Hermione whispered as she 
closed the book once she knew the coast was clear, Ginny smiled and 
instantly snuzzled up against the older girl.

         &#147;I don&#146;t know, and I don&#146;t care.&#148; Retorted the fiery haired 
girl as food appeared in front of Hermione, the brunette smirked and 
pulled out a piece of bacon and held it in front of Ginny playfully.

         &#147;I didn&#146;t see you eat anything yesterday, so you are going to 
make up for it today.&#148; Chortled the wild haired brunette as Ginny 
reluctantly opened her mouth and let Hermione feed her, with every 
bite the redhead took the more flushed the both of them became. 

         &#147;Mione you make me so happy.&#148; Purred Ginny as she rested her 
head on the other girl&#146;s shoulder, Hermione grinned and cupped the 
younger girl&#146;s cheek. 

         &#147;You make me happy too Gin.&#148; Declared the brunette as she 
leaned in and lightly seized the younger girl&#146;s lips with her own, 
Ginny returned the kiss and lightly wrapped her arms around Hermione&#146;s 
neck and brought her closer. 

         &#147;Miss Weasley, Miss Granger!&#148; A loud female voice boomed in 
the two Gryffindor girl&#146;s ears, in shock the two looked in the 
direction of the speaker. Standing in the opening of the Fat Lady 
stood Professor McGonagall with a look of complete disgust on her aged 
face. &#147;I sentenced you to your room for a purpose Miss Granger, as a 
punishment. I did not intend for you to spend it romping with your 
girlfriend.&#148; Anger was swelling in McGonagall&#146;s face as she spoke. &#147;I 
will not tolerate this sort of behaviour in my house, Miss Weasley, 
Miss Granger you may take yourselves down to the Great Hall like all 
other students, before I have a good mind to write to your parents.&#148; 
With that McGonagall turned on her heels and left the two girls 
confused. 

         &#147;Hermione&#133;what just happened?&#148; Ginny inquired as she turned 
and looked at the brunette.

         &#147;I don&#146;t really know, but I don&#146;t think we are in trouble.&#148; 
Replied Hermione as she stood up and helped the smaller girl to her 
feet, Ginny smiled lightly and hugged the older girl and nuzzled her 
face against her unruly brown hair. 

         &#147;I wish we could stay up here, then we could just hold each 
other and snuggle. But with all those people down there I doubt we can 
even hold hands.&#148; Ginny pouted as she gave the situation some serious 
thought, Hermione nodded light before she lightly tickled the younger 
girl&#146;s sides.

         &#147;Cheer up! It isn&#146;t all that bad, at least we won&#146;t have 
people calling us horrible names or trying to cast curses and jinx on 
us if we don&#146;t tell anyone we are dating.&#148; Hermione said even thought 
her own voice was suddenly sad at the thought, sighing both Gryffindor 
girl&#146;s headed to the Great Hall just as breakfast was over. Stopping 
in the middle of the hallway Ginny turned to Hermione and leaned up on 
her tiptoes so she could kiss the taller girl on the lips.

         &#147;Now you are the no that didn&#146;t eat, so you better make up 
for it during lunch.&#148; Ginny smirked and rushed off towards her first 
period class. 

------------------------------------------------------------

         Morning classes passed by painfully slow as lunch drew 
closer, Hermione sat in her desk with a glazed look in her eyes that 
both Ron and Harry noticed. 

         &#147;You okay Mione? You look almost sick again.&#148; Ron uttered 
under his breath, blinking Hermione nodded numbly.

         &#147;Completely fine Ron,&#148; Stated the brunette just as the bell 
rang that sounded for lunch, like a bolt Hermione picked up her books 
and rushed out of the class. &#147;See you guys at lunch, bye.&#148; Hermione 
yelled just as she exited the room, Ron and Harry looked at each other 
like they had down so many times in the past day.

         &#147;I wager she has gone insane.&#148; Ron grumbled lightly.

         &#147;And I wager that sounds pretty reasonable right now.&#148; Harry 
retorted with a sigh as he slid his glass up his nose and pick up his 
books. 

         As Hermione entered the Great Hall she instantly spotted a 
young flaming haired Gryffindor already seated at the table with her 
legs resting in the seat beside her, the look on her face told the 
prudent brunette that the young redhead would snap off anyone&#146;s head 
that tried to take the seat. 

         &#147;Your too cute Gin.&#148; Hermione whispered in a hush voice as 
she sat down beside the younger girl, their hands secretly finding 
each other under the table just as the Great Hall started to fill with 
other students. Ron and Harry both sat down in front of the couple 
just smiling unknowingly and completely oblivious to how close the two 
Gryffindor girls are.

         &#147;I thought you said you were being punished Hermione?&#148; Harry 
said just as food started to appear and an owl flew overhead and 
dropped a red letter onto Ginny&#146;s head, confusedly the redhead picked 
it up as her three brothers started to suppress laughter. 

         &#147;Oh&#133;dear&#133;it&#146;s a howler. I&#146;ve never gotten one before, I 
wonder what I did wrong?&#148; Ginny asked out loud though no one answered, 
the howler itself was shaking and blowing thick black smoke out of the 
edges of its corners. Swallowing hard Ginny pulled back the letter and 
fell backwards from the loud blast of her mother&#146;s voice. 

         &#147;Virginia Weasley how could you possibly be so dimwitted that 
you forgot I told you all about women&#146;s problems! Honestly girl I 
thought I taught you better than that! And imagine my surprise when I 
opened a howler from the school nurse, me getting a howler at my age! 
If you only knew how upset with you I am! Be glad I haven&#146;t showed up 
at that school of yours and taught you a thing or two in front of 
everyone! You best be getting good marks if you want to come home this 
Christmas!&#148; And with that the letter jumped out of Ginny&#146;s hands and 
burned to ash, slightly shaking the redheaded girl blinked a few 
moments before she looked at her brothers who were laughing to the 
point of tears.

         &#147;Lovely.&#148; Ginny muttered and turned to look at Hermione who 
was just as shocked as she was.

         &#147;Oh lookie what we have here! It&#146;s the bitch in heat, did you 
come to grace us all with your services?&#148; Malfoy yelled across the 
Great Hall, apparently he learned his lesion to stay away from 
Hermione when he opened his vile mouth. But little did that stop her 
from jumping to her feet and pulling out her wand. 

         &#147;I&#146;LL MURDER YOU, I TOLD YOU NOT TO TALK ABOUT MY GINNY LIKE 
THAT AGAIN OR I WILL MAKE YOU WISH FOR DEATH!!!&#148; Screamed Hermione as 
half of the Gryffindor Quidditch team was holding the raging brunette 
down in her seat. Quickly Ginny did the only thing she could think of 
to make Hermione calm down; with some difficulty (mainly due to the 
fact several people were hold Hermione down still) Ginny moved her 
head into the brunette&#146;s face and kissed her full on the lips. Silence 
filled the Great Hall as if Dumbledore himself had asked for everyone 
to be quite, the hands that were holding Hermione down released the 
brunette as she wrapped her arms around Ginny&#146;s neck and pulled her 
closer against her body, the kisses deepened and finally the silence 
was broken by Harry leaning into Ron and muttering something very 
softly almost as if not to ruin the moment. 

         &#147;You never told me Ginny was a lesbian.&#148; Was Harry&#146;s quick 
statement.  

         &#147;Never knew.&#148; Ron replied while staring at his baby sister 
and one of his best friends. 

         Pulling apart Ginny settled back down in her own seat while 
blushing feircely as was Hermione, deathlike silence was coming from 
the Slytherin table as Draco Malfoy sat there with his mouth hanging 
open and thinking to himself, &#145;Maybe I was too harsh to always want 
Granger dead, she seems to be good for at least something. Mmm-lesbian 
entertainment.&#146; 

         Smiling Ginny and Hermione held hands under the table again 
and looked at the rest of the Gryffindor table for some sign of 
approval, which never came. So clearing her throat lightly and very 
uncomfortably the redheaded Gryffindor girl spoke out in a meek voice. 

         &#147;Pass the peas.&#148;
