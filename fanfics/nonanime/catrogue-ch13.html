<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>The phone rang, and Kitty smiled happily as she recognized that 
familiar, gravely voice on the other end. &quot;Logan,&quot; she exclaimed 
happy.

&quot;Hey, Kitty,&quot; Logan replied, and she could almost imagine him leaning 
up against a door frame in the Mansion, a cigar in hand. &quot;How&#39;s 
Rogue?&quot; he asked.

Kitty grinned impishly, and in a sultry voice replied, &quot;Better that 
you could imagine.&quot;

Silence, then a mix of laughing and coughing coming from the other 
end. &quot;That&#39;s not what I meant,&quot; Logan chuckled.

&quot;Sorry, I guess I&#39;m just a bad girl,&quot; Kitty laughed.

&quot;This ain&#39;t a social call,&quot; Logan said with a sigh. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re 
taking on Elektra has got certain peoples attention. There&#39;s a Hand 
cadre lead by a master assassin on their way to Sydney,&quot; he reported 
grimly.

Kitty began to swear. &quot;It&#39;s a kill mission, probably,&quot; she mused, 
&quot;they want to prove that they can take out the best.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s how I read it,&quot; Logan agreed. Quietly, &quot;You want some backup? 
I can fire up the Blackbird and be down in Australia in a few hours.&quot;

It was tempting, Kitty had to admit. It would be nice fighting by 
Wolverine&#39;s side again, but... &quot;No, I think we can handle it,&quot; she 
smiled.

She could hear the approval in Logan&#39;s voice, &quot;Call me once the Hand&#39;s 
been ran off the place with their tails between their legs.&quot;

Kitty laughed, &quot;Will do.&quot;

Kitty set the phone down and picked up her communicator, dialing up 
Ororo and the others to let them know what was going on. Bishop 
answered on the first ring, and her eyes grew wide as she listened, 
&quot;What?!&quot;
The hospital corridors were bustling as Kitty ran through the 
hallways. &quot;What happened?&quot; she demanded as soon as she reached 
Bishop&#39;s side.

&quot;Poison, probably in the food,&quot; Bishop snarled. &quot;We all went out to 
lunch, and whatever it was kicked in while you were out,&quot; he 
explained.

&quot;Are they going to be all right?&quot; Kitty asked grimly.

Bishop nodded as he reassured her, &quot;It was a bit touch and go 
initially, but yeah, they&#39;ll be fine. It looks like what they used on 
us was meant to incapacitate, not kill.&quot; He paused before asking, &quot;Do 
you know who did this?&quot;

&quot;It was the Hand,&quot; Kitty said, looking through the window at her 
unconscious teammates in their hospital beds. Her eyes widened, 
noticing that someone was missing from the group, &quot;Rogue?&quot; She turned 
on Bishop, &quot;Is Rogue...?&quot;

&quot;Just fine,&quot; she heard from behind her, and turned to see Rogue 
standing there. She was as bit pale, but other than that she looked 
all right.

Kitty hugged her fiercely, &quot;Don&#39;t scare me like that.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Rogue smiled, wrapping her arms around her gently. &quot;My 
invulnerability, along with a bit of Wolvie&#39;s healing factor was 
enough for me to shrug off the poison&#39;s effects,&quot; she explained.

&quot;Lucas,&quot; a voice cried from down the hall. A blonde haired police 
officer ran up to them, her expression serious. &quot;There&#39;s been a 
kidnapping,&quot; she said.

&quot;What&#39;s the situation, Cat?&quot; Bishop asked.

The blonde haired Cat looked grim, &quot;A group of kids, babies almost, 
got grabbed from a school bus on their way home.&quot;

&quot;Any ransom note?&quot; Bishop was all business.

Cat flipped open her notebook and read, &quot;Do not attempt to flee us, 
Pryde. Face our challenge, or their lives are forfeit.&quot; A numerical 
code was read off next.

&quot;Those bastards,&quot; Rogue murmured.

&quot;We&#39;re going back to the house,&quot; Kitty said to Rogue, and then to 
Bishop, &quot;then we&#39;re going after them. Do your best to keep the police 
off our back.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Cat grabbed at her arm, &quot;what&#39;s going on here?&quot;

&quot;My name is Kitty Pryde,&quot; she said, &quot;and those kids were kidnapped as 
bait for me.&quot; A grim little smile as Kitty added, &quot;I don&#39;t intend to 
disappoint them.&quot;

With that, Kitty phased out of her grip and she and Rogue simply 
disappeared.

Cat gapped at them in shock. She looked up at Bishop, &quot;She&#39;s the best, 
isn&#39;t she?&quot;

Bishop thought about denying it, but decided not too, &quot;Yep, she is.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re helping them,&quot; Cat looked up at him thoughtfully.

&quot;Might be our best shot to save those kids,&quot; Bishop defended himself.

Cat raised her eyebrow, &quot;Uh huh?&quot;
Kitty took her team uniform from the closet, checking it over before 
pulling it on smoothly. The Black and blue uniform blended into the 
shadows, helping her move about unseen. Tonight, she was going to need 
it.

&quot;What&#39;s the plan?&quot; Rogue asked, her own black and red suit on.

Kitty opened up a silk bag in the bottom of her drawer, drawing forth 
a handful of silvery shuriken. She slid them into pouches hidden 
around her costume even as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll slip inside, and track down 
the master assassin leading them. Once I take him down, the Hand will 
pull out.&quot;

&quot;How can I help?&quot; Rogue asked.

Kitty sighed softly, hesitating. &quot;I could use a distraction,&quot; she 
admitted. &quot;But they use magical weapons, love. It could be dangerous,&quot; 
she cautioned her.

Rogue smiled, &quot;Danger is our business.&quot; Quietly, she added, &quot;There&#39;s 
no way I could let you go into danger and at least try to help.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, love,&quot; Kitty hugged her gently.

&quot;But how, exactly, are we going to find them?&quot; Rogue asked.

&quot;Those numbers Bishop&#39;s partner read off,&quot; Kitty explained as she lead 
Rogue downstairs, &quot;are for a coordinate system. I bet it&#39;s a location 
in town.&quot;

&quot;Should we split up?&quot; Rogue asked as they stepped outside. She locked 
the door, then turned to Kitty, who smiled gently.

&quot;I don&#39;t really want to,&quot; Kitty admitted, &quot;but it&#39;s a good idea.&quot; She 
kissed Rogue gently on the cheek, whispering the location in her ear, 
&quot;I&#39;ll meet you there.&quot;

With that, she seemed to simply disappear.

&quot;I have got to get her to teach me to do that,&quot; Rogue said to herself, 
rising into the air and soaring off into her own mission. She reached 
the target in moments, spotting the guards nearby and simply ramming 
into them.

Kitty could hear the alarms wailing as she neared, slipping into and 
out of shadows nearing the building. She phased down into the sewers, 
and made her way forward cautiously. The only guard left was nervous, 
hesitant, holding his sword white knuckled.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Kitty said cheerfully as she came around the corner, &quot;could you 
direct me to the Opera house? I&#39;m lost.&quot;

He gaped at her, hesitating just long enough for a smoothly thrown 
shuriken to find it&#39;s way to his throat. A soft gurgle, and he dropped 
to the ground, dissolving. Silently, Kitty ventured on into the 
building itself.
The news covered the kidnapping, describing the assailants costume. It 
was sketchy, but for her, it was more than enough to recognize the 
culprits. &quot;The Hand,&quot; she murmured softly. She had chosen to face 
Pryde honorably, in combat. What the Hand were doing had no honor at 
all.

&quot;Kidnapping children,&quot; she muttered angrily, rising from her chair. 
Such a thing simply should not be tolerated, not by any true warrior. 
She dressed silently, pulling on her battle garb, then disappeared 
into the night.
Rogue grinned, watching the Hand soldiers surrounding her. It was 
actually kind of fun, fighting against a bunch of goons in pajamas. 
Yes, they were dangerous, but normally she had to hold back against 
most enemies.

But whatever the Hand were, they weren&#39;t fully human any more.

Rogue blew out a weary breath. Overwhelming numbers, on the other 
hand, could be a bit of a problem. She had already taken out dozens of 
the ninja, but they just kept coming. Suddenly, they leapt, and Rogue 
was swamped in black clad figures.

She struggled to try and free herself, but there was just too many of 
them. Then she heard a soft cry, as a flash of metal blades gleamed in 
the darkness. The Hand pulled back, revealing a crouched figure, 
blades extended.

&quot;Wolvie?&quot; Rogue asked, surprised.

&quot;Not quite,&quot; Lady Deathstrike said, offering her hand to Rogue.

Rogue took it even as she asked, &quot;But why?&quot;

Deathstrike smiled, &quot;I have no fondness for the Hand.&quot; More seriously, 
&quot;And those who would threaten children are below contempt.&quot;

&quot;You got that right,&quot; Rogue agreed. The Hand began to mass for another 
attack, and Rogue grinned, &quot;Let&#39;s take them, shall we?&quot;

Deathstrike grinned back, &quot;Lets.&quot; The fingers of each of her hands 
extended, becoming sword like blades.

&#39;Two can play at that game,&#39; Rogue thought. She called upon the powers 
that she had once absorbed from Wolverine, and popped bone claws from 
the back of her hands. They exchanged a glance, and together charged.
Kitty watched silently as the black clad woman watched the situation 
falling apart on her. &quot;How many Ninja have fallen?&quot; she asked again 
disbelievingly, sweeping her long white hair back with a gesture.

&quot;Fully half our cadre,&quot; the young man admitted. He didn&#39;t see the blow 
coming, coughing as he spat blood on the floor.

&quot;They are only two,&quot; she said disbelievingly. &quot;And where is Pryde?&quot; 
she demanded.

&#39;Sounds like my cue,&#39; Kitty though, tossing out shuriken into the few 
soldiers into the room. &quot;Right here,&quot; she declared.

&quot;How did you,&quot; the assassin turned, shocked, and Kitty was upon her, 
They fought gracefully, across the cramped control room. Blades flew 
midair, but Kitty dodged them gracefully, managing to catch the woman 
across the cheek with a shuriken.

&quot;Give it up,&quot; Kitty said simply.

&quot;You&#39;re faster than me,&quot; she murmured, reaching up to touch her bloody 
cheek. She smiled, her expression one of honest pleasure, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot; 
She pressed a switch on her control panel, quietly, &quot;Release the 
children.&quot;

A surprised sounding voice replied, &quot;Mistress, they&#39;re gone.&quot;

The white haired woman looked up to meet Kitty&#39;s eyes. Kitty just 
shrugged, &quot;I would have been here sooner, otherwise.&quot;

&quot;My name is Sakura,&quot; the white haired woman bowed, &quot;and I look forward 
to meeting you again.&quot; Kitty threw her shuriken, but they just passed 
through her as she teleported away.

&#39;Why do I get the feeling she&#39;s going to be back?&#39; Kitty wondered.

The Hand slowed, then stopped. As if receiving a silent cue, they 
pulled back, disappearing into the shadows. &quot;Looks like Kitty reached 
their leader,&quot; Rogue sighed.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Deathstrike said, turning to leave.

Rogue gently took her arm, &quot;Wait a minute.&quot; Deathstrike frowned, 
flexed her finger blades threateningly, but Rogue carried on, &quot;At 
least stick around long enough for Kitty to thank you.&quot;

Deathstrike hesitated, then, &quot;Very well.&quot;

Kitty phased through the building&#39;s outer wall, airwalking down to the 
ground. &quot;Look who&#39;s here,&quot; Rogue cried.

Kitty smiled, dropping down to the earth. She smiled, bowing 
respectfully, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Deathstrike smiled just slightly, &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; She turned, and 
slowly walked away.

&quot;Care to join us in a victory celebration?&quot; Rogue asked. She paused, 
&quot;well, actually we&#39;re going to be tending to our teammates for a while 
but once they&#39;re better...&quot;

Deathstrike surprised them with a laugh, &quot;I&#39;ll think about it.&quot;
