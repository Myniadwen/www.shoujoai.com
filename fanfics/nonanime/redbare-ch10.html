Warming her was essential. This place was too cold. In the basement 
there was a boiler. It was the only heat source I could think of. I 
sighed. It was down there. Whatever it was. Her dad had to take care of 
it. I couldn&#39;t go down there.

I rubbed her. Spontaneously. It was the way out. I took her fine hands 
and rubbed them. Slowly but surely they got warmer. It wasn&#39;t enough. I 
rubbed her arms. Inside and outside the sleeves. Her bare knees too. Her 
ankles. Thighs, shoulders, chest, belly.

Her cheeks turned crimson. I couldn&#39;t see them in the darkness, the glow 
from the sign was all red anyway, but I felt it. Her face was glowing. 
Her breath wasn&#39;t shallow anymore, but she still didn&#39;t respond. More. I 
worked harder.

I let my fingers do the walking. She moaned when I touched her injured 
shoulder. I lifted the shirt a little to check on the bandage. It was 
dry, but I couldn&#39;t see if any blood had leaked through. The red light 
wouldn&#39;t let me.

She moaned again. I used my underarm and she got warmer. Much warmer. I 
rubbed faster and she moved a little. Just a bit. She didn&#39;t say 
anything when I quietly spoke to her.

Seconds and minutes. Maybe hours? I never got tired. I kept moving my 
underarm back and forth, feeling the warmth fill the air. It was 
aromatic warmth. Not the smell of our dresses, but something else. The 
air bought a piece of it to me. Just nicely scenting warmth or whatever 
it was.

She panted and squirmed. I pressed my arm harder against her body. Her 
breath was fast and kept getting faster. Her limbs were shaking. Her 
belly too. The chest went up and down rapidly. At last she opened her 
eyes and looked at me.

I grinded hard. It turned rhythmic. Willing. Unconscious and willingly 
following. She wanted to get warmer also. It felt better when she was 
helping.

I didn&#39;t know if she was still cold. I didn&#39;t stop rubbing. She closed 
her eyes halfway and said something blurry. Then she cried out 
wordlessly. Just a long and uncontrolled moan. She shook a lot. She was 
dazed. The girl was able to move and I let go of her.

She was sweating and shaking. I put my palm on her forehead. It was hot. 
Like she was having a fever. She didn&#39;t seem sick though. At least I 
didn&#39;t smile when I felt bad. She was smiling. A weird smile. A 
contagious smile. I felt a little better.

It took a minute before she was completely conscious. She just looked at 
me briefly and turned away. I could feel her blushing. Her entire body 
was warm. I told her we had to leave. After a few pleas she turned back 
and got off the bench. She took my hand and we left the yard with the 
painting.

Through the doors and down to the basement. Further down. All the way 
down to the core of my nightmare. A room. Huge. Metal floor. Darkness. 
Horrible smell. Rust. I hated rust.

A fire was started in the middle. The room was illuminated, revealing 
what I already knew. An awful place. But something... no, someone. There 
was someone. In the other end of the great, nightmarish hall. It was 
him. He was there.

He wasn&#39;t alone. Something unpleasant was standing in the corner, 
glaring at him and us. I stuck my tongue out at it. He laughed. There 
was no need to be scared.

The girl&#39;s dad was suddenly there too. He didn&#39;t notice us. It noticed 
him though. It stomped across the floor and screamed at him. We watched 
them fight, the man and the beast.

He was faster than the monster. Much faster. It was almost like he was 
playing with it. It had hit him, but when he ran around the fire and the 
mechanics it couldn&#39;t follow him. He hurt it. Just a little bit. A path 
of blood and smelly slobber encircled the fire.

The monster was huge and could easily cope with the damage, but it was 
annoyed. Again and again he got away. In the end it screamed, sped up, 
and opened its mouth to swallow him whole. It was a fairytale I read 
once. And just like in the story it was a great mistake. He fired into 
its mouth. It dropped dead.

There was no echo. The weapon made a lot of noise, but there was no 
echo. It was like a dream. Nothing was really real. Fairytale and 
nightmare. I stared at the dead monster. The headache went away.

I put down the key he had given me. He was gone before I could ask him 
anything. The girl&#39;s father didn&#39;t look too good. I made sure he had 
seen the key. Then I concentrated and walked out. An awful noise. 
Somewhere. I hated it.
