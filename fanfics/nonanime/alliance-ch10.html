Helena Bertinelli paused, her black hair falling into
her eyes as she looked over the headquarters of the
Justice Society. It was a busy place these days, new
heroes pouring in as the group strove to train the
next generation of legacy heroes. Of course, as
Huntress she was here for another reason, one that had
started some time ago...

Power Girl showed up over a year ago, deeply confused
for reasons Huntress only learned about later. At the
time the busty blonde heroine had been mentally
tampered with by the villain Psycho Pirate, who was
making her see visions of alternate lives she could
have lived. Apparently in many of those lives there
was a connection between then, and Huntress had to
admit she felt a odd... bond with the heroine.

Ducking into a alley Huntress quickly changed into her
purple and black garb, adjusting her mask until it set
right then, squaring her shoulders marched up to the
Gotham city landmark. As she neared the doors silver
spheres smoothly detached from the building and swept
around her as a voice quietly noted, &quot;Huntress, former
member Justice League, associate of Black Canary.
Entrance permitted.&quot;

&quot;Nice security system,&quot; Huntress murmured as she
walked in, passing finely decorated collums as she
looked around. There were no picture or decorations
announcing who they were, but they weren&#39;t needed. The
world already knew who the JSA were, the members no
longer needed to prove anything to anyone.

&quot;Eee!&quot; the squeal of a girl made Huntress blink in
surprise as the red headed girl in red and green
rushed up to her,
&quot;ohmygodyourtheHuntressI&#39;veheardofyouyouwereintheJLAand...&quot;

&quot;Cyclone!&quot; the blonde in blue, red and white laughed,
&quot;slow down.&quot; Stargirl smiled up at Huntress as she
continued, &quot;Sorry, she&#39;s a superheroine fangirl and
can get a little over excited.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Cyclone smiled shyly.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Huntress smiled, remembering her own
awed reaction to meeting Superman. Clearing her throat
she asked, &quot;I was looking for Power Girl...?&quot;

Cyclone smiled, &quot;She just got back from a mission, I
think she&#39;s in her quarters...?&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Huntress said after getting quick directions
from the two girls.

The Justice Society&#39;s headquarters was a...
interesting place. As she walked Huntress saw the new
Starman float by, peeked in to see Wildcat sparring
with his son, and several others playing cards. There
was a oddly homey atmosphere, along with a feeling
of... belonging.

&#39;Pretty different from when I was in the Justice
League,&#39; Helena mused as she reached the correct door
and knocked.

After a moment the door opened and Power Girl gazed in
surprise at Huntress, her eyes widening slightly.
&quot;Huntress,&quot; she smiled slightly, &quot;what a surprise...&quot;

Huntress smiled back as she conceded, &quot;It&#39;s been a
while, but I wanted to see you.&quot;

Power Girl gave her a searching look then nodded,
&quot;Come on in.&quot; The room inside was untidy but not badly
so, with Power Girl&#39;s red cape draped over a chair as
the blonde stalked over to the mini kitchen and poured
out some juice. &quot;Do you want some?&quot; she offered as
Huntress took a seat on the couch.

&quot;No, thanks,&quot; Huntress said, sighing as she wondered
what the hell she was doing here. Looking up at Power
Girl she was struck by her physical beauty and pure
presence. Unlike many heroines she wasn&#39;t just
beautiful with her lovely face and well built body,
but she also radiated a incredible sense of power and
presence. Even more astonishingly she seemed mostly
unaware of her effect on others.

Power Girl walked over to a nearby chair, sitting down
with a sigh. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she smiled slightly, &quot;it&#39;s been
a long day.&quot;

Huntress eagerly seized on that, and the two heroines
began to relax as they compaired their various bad day
experiences. By the time Huntress finished recounting
her worst day in Metropolis they had both relaxed and
were on a first name basis.

&quot;So Helena,&quot; Karen leaned forward as she looked at her
curiously, &quot;why did you want to see me?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s kind of strange,&quot; Helena admitted, trying not to
look at the open window of flesh visable above Karen&#39;s
breasts.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Karen asked.

&quot;Last year, you came to me when you were in trouble,&quot;
Helena looked over at her searchingly as she asked,
&quot;why?&quot;

Karen, oddly, blushed faintly. &quot;I guess Oracle has
filled you in on my background?&quot; she asked after a
moment.

&quot;You come from a alternate Earth,&quot; Helena said, &quot;one
that was destroyed in a great crisis. In that world
you were the alternate version of Supergirl, I think.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s pretty much the case,&quot; Karen nodded. &quot;There
were also counterparts there of many heroes...
including you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s how you knew me!&quot; Helena sat up in surprise.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Karen agreed with a bit of sadness in her
eyes, &quot;your name was even Helena there, too.&quot;

Helena felt a odd twinge as she met Karen&#39;s eyes. &quot;You
two were close?&quot;

A faint blush colored Karen&#39;s cheeks. &quot;We were both
second generation heroes,&quot; she remembered as she sat
back, &quot;her the daughter of Batman, I the successor of
Superman and we immediately had that to bond over.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Helena said. She looked at Karen,
once again noting how beautiful she was, struck by a
odd moment of vertigo...

&quot;Helena?&quot; Karen asked.

&quot;Just... remembering something,&quot; Helena murmured.
&quot;Something odd happened during the second Crisis...&quot;

Karen looked sympathetic, &quot;You got someone else&#39;s
memories?&quot;

&quot;You know?&quot; Helena blinked.

&quot;It happened to a few JSA members too,&quot; Karen
revealed, &quot;they suddenly recalled living lives on
Earth 2, or at least bits and pieces.&quot;

Helena looked at Karen with a faintly pained look as
she revealed, &quot;That&#39;s why I was asking you about the
other Huntress.&quot;

After studying Helena a moment a faint blush colored
Karen&#39;s cheeks, &quot;What sort of memories are we dealing
with here?&quot;

&quot;Intimate ones,&quot; Helena looked away.

Karen looked more than a bit embarrassed. &quot;I&#39;m... not
quite sure what to say,&quot; she chuckled nervously.

&quot;Could you,&quot; Helena searched for the right words, &quot;put
this into some kind of context? Or I&#39;m never going to
be able to look at you without blushing again.&quot;

Karen grinned at that comment. She took a drink then
said, &quot;You have to understand, I never dated much
before. I had been raised in a simulated version of
Krypton, and after I arrived on Earth I found it hard
to relate to people.&quot; She looked thoughtful, &quot;The one
guy I dated, Andrew, really didn&#39;t turn out well
either.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Helena murmured.

&quot;The Huntress I knew didn&#39;t have much better luck,&quot;
Karen mused, &quot;and one night we left a JSA meeting and
went off to drown our sorrows.&quot;

&quot;And one thing led to another?&quot; Helena gulped.

Karen winked, &quot;Pretty much. And no, I&#39;m not going into
any more detail.&quot;

&quot;Trust me,&quot; Helena blushed, &quot;I already have too much
detail.&quot;

Karen was tempted to ask, but decided not to.

Helena got up, stretching as she picked up her
costume&#39;s mask off a nearby table, watching as Karen
got up too. Looking at Karen she was struck by the
almost physical memory of tugging that white cloth
down and feasting on those full breasts.

Moving quickly Karen rushed over to catch Helena as
she swayed, watching the woman&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;Are you
all right?&quot; she asked gently.

&quot;That was almost as embarassing as yelling the wrong
name with Oracle a few nights back,&quot; Helena confessed.

Karen looked a bit startled, &quot;You and Oracle?&quot;

&quot;Try not to tell anyone,&quot; Helena blushed.

&quot;My lips are sealed,&quot; Karen noted, feeling a twinge of
regret. &quot;Does Black Canary know?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d guess so,&quot; Helena said, cheeks still read.

Karen checked the time as she picked up her cape.
&quot;Wanna go talk about it?&quot; she offered. A grin, &quot;I
promise not to take advantage.&quot;

Helena grinned back, glad she had someone else to talk
about this with. &quot;You know, I&#39;d like that,&quot; she
admitted as they walked out together. &quot;I can&#39;t talk
about this stuff with Lady Blackhawk, she&#39;s a bit...
old fashioned.&quot;

&quot;But cute,&quot; Karen added,

Helena chuckled, &quot;When she found out a good looking
male friend of ours was gay, her first reaction was
that she and I should kidnap him and convert him
straight.&quot;

&quot;I see what you mean,&quot; Karen snickered.

End...?

Notes: During &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; the members of Doom
Patrol regained memories of a alternate past, so I
thought it might be interesting if it happened to
others. Originally intended as a PWP, but the
characters wouldn&#39;t let me go there.
