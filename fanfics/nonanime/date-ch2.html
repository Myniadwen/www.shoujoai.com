<h1>The Date (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/date-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Ivana Baul fought back a smile as they moved into the
nightclub, Caitlin leading the way with a smooth
capability. She was a beautiful young woman with that
golden brown hair, beautiful body and oddly gentle
eyes and Ivana got some pleasure out of just watching
her.

&quot;Should we grab a table or mingle?&quot; Caitlin asked as
she paused, letting two young woman slink by with
their hands possessively on each other&#39;s bodies.

&quot;A table,&quot; Ivana ordered, &quot;we can wait for my contact
there.&quot;

Caitlin watched the crowd warily as they continued on,
the taller young woman fully into her role of
bodyguard and Ivana found herself wondering if this
little deception was really such a good idea. Yes, she
was meeting certain individuals here but Caitlin&#39;s
presence wasn&#39;t really necessary for this. Instead,
she was here simply for Ivana&#39;s personal reasons.

&#39;I should know better than to mix business and
pleasure,&#39; Ivana thought to herself wryly, &#39;but the
temptation was just too strong for me to resist.&#39; She
smiled up at Caitlin as she held out a chair for her
and murmured, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Caitlin answered before taking her
own seat. She looked over at Ivana as she asked, &quot;So
who are we going to be meeting?&quot;

&quot;The daughters of a very conservative Senator and a
certain major labor leader,&quot; Ivana said to her calmly,
&quot;their sexual preference will be very embarrassing if
it&#39;s publicly revealed, so I expect they&#39;ll willingly
meet my demands.&quot;

&quot;Typical Ivana,&quot; Caitlin muttered with a frown.

Ivana looked over at her thoughtfully. &quot;Both young
women are being hypocrites,&quot; she calmly pointed out,
&quot;profiting from their father&#39;s power.&quot; She finished
with, &quot;If they weren&#39;t keeping such secrets, I
wouldn&#39;t have any leverage to use against them.&quot;

A clearly troubled Caitlin conceded, &quot;You&#39;ve got a
point.&quot;

&#39;The young woman was so charmingly innocent, in some
ways,&#39; Ivana mused. Caitlin hadn&#39;t even figured out
the nasty trick that Ivana had pulled on her, calling
due the favor that Caitlin owed her multiple times and
then just erasing the girl&#39;s memory of it afterward.
&#39;Of course,&#39; Ivana noted, &#39;it was just such a mission
that sparked this mad idea.&#39;

Ivana had needed an invulnerable agent to investigate
a potentially dangerous superhuman and she had
instantly thought of Caitlin. The uniform that she had
equipped Caitlin with had been nearly fetishistic,
made of skin tight black leather, and Ivana had been
startled by how she had been effected by it. Add that
to all the verbal sparring that she and Caitlin had
engaged in, nearly flirting as Caitlin investigated
the situation and you had a recipe for disaster.

Ivana fought back a surge of amusement as Caitlin
blushed fiercely, observing two ladies making out at a
table nearby. One of the women was dressed in what
looked just like a modified Stormwatch uniform, the
other in just bikini top and bottoms. &quot;I&#39;m surprised
this bothers you,&quot; Ivana noted, &quot;considering your
close friendship with Rainmaker.&quot;

Caitlin rolled her eyes as she sighed, &quot;Despite what
Grunge and Burnout would like to think, we&#39;re just
friends.&quot;

Ivana just had to chuckle at the clear exasperation
she heard in Caitlin&#39;s voice as she asked, &quot;You get
that question a lot, I take it?&quot;

&quot;If it isn&#39;t those two hormonally overactive guys,&quot;
Caitlin sighed, &quot;it&#39;s my little sister asking if we&#39;re
just a little too close.&quot;

Ivana suddenly had a vivid mental image of Caitlin and
Sarah Rainmaker together, the lovely native American
and the amazonian girl and had to smile. &quot;You should
try a lesbian experience,&quot; Ivana said with a wicked
smile, &quot;it can be quite... rewarding.&quot;

Caitlin&#39;s face went beet red. &quot;You mean you have?&quot; she
blurted.

Ivana sat back casually, knowing that the slinky red
dress she had chosen highlighted her many charms.
&quot;More than once,&quot; she conceded then chuckled at a
pleasant memory, &quot;Bliss was quite the busy little
seductress.&quot;

Bliss had been one of the more eager operatives that
Ivana had recruited for her team the Deviants, the
young beauty quite willing to use her pleasure
inducing mental gift. The redhead had dressed in the
most scanty clothing, thongs and bikini&#39;s, and she had
been relentless in her pursuit of Ivana. Of course the
older woman understood why Bliss did so, her deep
seated lust for power, but she had enjoyed their
little tryst none the less.

&quot;I thought that you and Threshold...,&quot; Caitlin
murmured uncomfortably.

&quot;Him, too,&quot; Ivana said quite agreeably. Smiling she
picked up her drink, taking a sip before adding, &quot;You
could categorize me as a bisexual, I guess.&quot; Silently
she added, &#39;But emotionally, I&#39;m much more attracted
to women.&#39;

Caitlin looked up, her eyes narrowing as she tracked
movement in the crowd around them. Quietly she
reported, &quot;Incoming.&quot;

Ivana didn&#39;t turn around, maintaining a deliberately
casual manner as she waited. The brown haired girl
lead the way, the redhead following submissively as
they reached the table. &#39;Just like in the bedroom,&#39;
Ivana thought to herself amusedly.

&quot;What do you want from us, Baul?&quot; Ms. Tree asked,
looking at Ivana with a scowl through her brown bangs.

&quot;Just a simple vote,&quot; Ivana said casually, &quot;there&#39;s a
new law to help restrict the creation of Super Powered
Beings coming up, I want some no votes.&quot;

&quot;But we don&#39;t have that kind of influence,&quot; Ms.
Hatfield protested, the redhead&#39;s voice having as
clear whine to it.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you can manage,&quot; Ivana paused a moment
before adding, &quot;the photo&#39;s and video I have would be
very embarrassing if they were given to the news
media.&quot;

Ms. Tree studied Ivana, her brown eyes narrowed
slightly. &quot;And what guarantee do we have that this is
the only favor you&#39;ll ask?&quot; she demanded.

Ivana looked at the girl with a bit more respect in
her eyes. &quot;You don&#39;t,&quot; she said simply, &quot;but doing
this for me would certainly help keep you on my good
side.&quot;

Ms. Hatfield clenched her hands to still their
shaking, tears on the corners of her eyes. &quot;I won&#39;t be
blackmailed,&quot; she hissed.

Ivana&#39;s eyes widened as the girl pulled the pistol
out, her thoughts racing. &#39;I underestimated her,&#39; she
realized as the plastic and ceramic pistol came up
aimed right at her face, a weapon designed not to
trigger any security systems.

Then Caitlin was there, the pistol roaring even as she
threw herself across the table to put herself right
between Ivana and the bullets. They hit the carpet
with a soft thump, Caitlin looking down with alarm as
she demanded fiercely, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

Ivana looked up at Caitlin dumbly, her eyes wide as
she met the younger woman&#39;s eyes. &quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot;
Ivana murmured.

&quot;What?&quot; Caitlin blinked.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Ivana shook herself, quickly recovering
her composure as Caitlin rose then helped her up to
her feet, &quot;I&#39;m all right.&quot;

The security forces arrived almost as soon as Ms.
Hatfield fired her gun, young women in black suits
rushing in to subdue both women. Ms. Tree loudly
claimed she didn&#39;t know anything about it but they
just ignored her, whisking the two of them out of the
building.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how this happened,&quot; the leader of the
security team said seriously, &quot;but I intend to find
out, I assure you.&quot; With that she turned and strode
away, the set of her shoulders determined.

Ivana turned Caitlin around, smiling wryly at the
bullet holes in the suit the girl wore. The flesh
underneath was unharmed, of course, but it couldn&#39;t
hurt to check. &quot;It looks like that lovely body of
yours held up pretty well,&quot; she finally said with a
false sort of casualness, Ivana&#39;s hands lingering on
the flesh of Caitlin&#39;s back.

Caitlin blushed slightly, the taller woman nodding as
she said, &quot;Being shot stings but other than that, not
bad.&quot;

As Ivana stood there she could pick up the warm scent
of the other girl, the healthy vitality. She shook
herself, moving back a bit as she thought, &#39;She did
what she did because she takes her promises
seriously.&#39; A mocking smile, &quot;She hates your guts,
remember?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t hate you,&quot; Caitlin answered. As Ivana looked
up at her in shock she continued, &quot;You accidentally
said that aloud.&quot; She gave a wry little smile as
Caitlin explained, &quot;I may not like you much, but I
don&#39;t hate you, either.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ivana answered, feeling her cheeks
flaming as they stood there together. A mad impulse
seized her as she looked up into those innocent eyes,
&quot;Do you want to dance?&quot;

Caitlin looked down at her searchingly before nodding
slightly. They cut away from their table and went out
on the dance floor, the taller Caitlin leading as they
began to sway together. &quot;You didn&#39;t just ask me out to
protect you, did you?&quot; Caitlin asked.

Ivana relaxed slightly as Caitlin gently guided them
across the floor. &quot;That wasn&#39;t the only reason,&quot; she
admitted, feeling a bit of red to her cheeks. &#39;I must
look like some damn schoolgirl,&#39; she thought to
herself irritably.

&quot;I&#39;m not....&quot; Caitlin&#39;s cheeks were almost as red as
Ivana&#39;s as she tried again to say, &quot;I mean, I&#39;ve never
tried....&quot;

Ivana reached up, putting a finger over Caitlin&#39;s
lips. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she softly reassured her, but
it wasn&#39;t, not really. As they danced she realized
that her emotion for Caitlin was stronger than ever,
something greater than a simple need. A soft buzz came
from her wristband and Ivana scowled, &quot;It&#39;s time to
go, I think.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Caitlin looked relieved as they slipped away
from the dancers, the tall woman watching over Ivana
protectively.

The jet picked them up outside right on cue and they
were off, flying across the night sky to eventually
reach the campsite. Ivana dropped Caitlin off,
lingering in the hatch to look at the young woman,
dressed once again in her casual clothes.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ivana said softly.

Caitlin smiled, &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

Ivana closed the hatch, still in her fine dress as she
returned to her seat. She used the intercom to order,
&quot;Back home, please.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not going to edit her memory?&quot; the pilot asked
as the jet rumbled, shaking slightly as it rose up
into the air.

&quot;No, not this time,&quot; Ivana answered shortly. She
looked out the window, down at the quickly
disappearing campsite and thought, &#39;This isn&#39;t over,
Caitlin Fairchild.&#39;

The End

Authors Notes: I was originally going to have this end
with a romantic moment between Ivana and Caitlin, but
after some thought I decided it wasn&#39;t realistic.
Caitlin is very straight, has had a few straight
crushes and no crushes on girls. She does have a close
friendship with her lesbian teammate Sarah Rainmaker,
but it doesn&#39;t appear to be romantic.</pre>
