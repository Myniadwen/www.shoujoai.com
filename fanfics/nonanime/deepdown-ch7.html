	&quot;A black hole is the most powerful, most mysterious phenomenon in the 
universe. The gravity within a black hole is so intense that not even light, 
the fastest object we know of, can escape its force.&quot;

	Makoto sighed for the 16th time that class period.  She knew it was the 
16th because she&#39;d been keeping track in her notebook next to the scratches 
of insignificance she&#39;d been doodling.  The teacher had been droning on for 
nearly 33 minutes now, the chestnut haired girl becoming a notorious 
clock-watcher during the class period, and probably along with most of the 
other students, felt like a pencil through the hand would feel a lot more 
pleasant.

	&#39;At least it wouldn&#39;t be nearly as boring as this.&#39;

	Emerald eyes lingered across the room for a moment, making a note that one 
for every three students was nodding off, and the other one for those same 
three would be doodling or reading a book hidden inside their text.  There 
was only one person who could take this punishment; but alas, she was at 
home resting at the moment.  The tall girl caught herself quickly as she 
finished the thought.  Ami would definitely not be resting, but probably 
catching up on her studying for missing two days worth of classes.

	Shaking her head, Makoto quickly looked back down to her notebook, eager 
for a distraction.  All weekend long she had been thinking about her short 
and cute classmate and each time she thought about it, she chastised herself 
for it.  The teen had already known that her attraction to girls far 
outweighed any sort of attraction to boys, so it wasn&#39;t that the chestnut 
haired girl was mad for being a lesbian.  Rather, she was annoyed by the 
fact that baby blue eyes made her melt into a gel-like substance.

	&quot;I will blaze a trail for my path ahead and if people get burnt in my wake, 
I cannot be held responsible because it&#39;s not my fault.&quot;  Emerald eyes shot 
upwards meeting the accusing glare of her teacher.  He had stopped lecturing 
sometime between Makoto&#39;s thoughts and was reading over the tall girl&#39;s 
shoulder in her notebook.  &quot;As creative as that is, Kino-san, you are 
obviously not paying attention to my lecture.  You will stay after class to 
talk to me.&quot;

	Half-heartedly, the chestnut haired girl mumbled her reply, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

	Snickers and chuckles spread throughout the classroom as everyone watched 
their scraggly and often rude classmate get in trouble.  The tomboy simply 
rolled her eyes at the surrounding students and shot glares towards a few 
that appeared as though they were going to try to take it further.  Quiet 
quickly hushed over the classroom when the teacher yelled aloud for everyone 
to settle down or else there would be four chapters of reading added onto 
the already lengthy homework assignment.

	28 more minutes passed before the bell finally rang signifying the end of 
class.  Emerald eyes fixed their stare ahead, body unmoving as everyone else 
around the teenager hustled to gather their things and head towards lunch.  
Makoto swallowed, unconsciously, out of anger; not anger that she&#39;d been 
caught not paying attention, but that the teacher had the gall to read out 
loud to everyone what she&#39;d written in her notebook.

	She was angry with herself even more so for carelessly leaving it in a spot 
where anyone could read from it.  It wasn&#39;t as though the entire notebook 
was considered off limits.  The chestnut haired girl could have even cared 
less for that particular passage.  Her anger was fused to the lack of 
respect the teacher showed her.

	After all, Makoto had rightly earned that respect.

	&quot;Sensei, do you have Ami-chan&#39;s homework ready?&quot;

	Tilting her head slightly, the tomboy watched curiously as a raven haired 
girl, bent over the teacher&#39;s desk and retrieved some papers.  Searching her 
memory, the tall girl recalled that her name was Hino.  Ami&#39;s best friend.  
Long, raven hair fell down the young girls back, one portion of it done in a 
lengthy braid.  The girl was probably just a tad bit taller than Ami, but a 
lot more voluptuous.  &#39;Especially in the chest.&#39;

	Makoto suppressed a grin at the thought, and continued to check out the 
genius&#39; friend.  Hino, though wearing the school uniform, had changed parts 
of it to her own liking.  Instead of having only one button undone on the 
white shirt, the girl had so generously left three undone.  Her skirt was 
folded over at the hem, therefore shortening the length and showing a lot 
more leg.

	Snorting slightly, Makoto realized Hino&#39;s intent: sexiness.  Sexiness that 
no one was allowed to touch.  She had seen this girl around school and 
observed her fiery temper with anyone that overstepped their boundaries.  
The green eyed girl had been less than impressed, though, with the raven 
haired girl&#39;s outbursts, probably owing to the fact that she&#39;d had a 
difficult time remembering her in the first place.

	The smooth and rhythmic clack of heels entered her ears and Makoto watched 
unemotionally as the fiery young girl strode confidently past the taller 
teen.  Their eyes met briefly as Hino walked right by the other girls desk 
and Makoto could swear that she felt the heat radiating from the fire that 
danced within lavender eyes.

	&quot;Kino-san, come up here please.&quot;

	Emerald eyes rolled themselves unconsciously as the tall girl gathered up 
her belongings into her book bag and headed towards the front of the room.  
Once at the teacher&#39;s desk, Makoto lifted her eyes in a challenging manner, 
meeting darkened and smoky eyes which challenged back.  Despite today&#39;s 
occurrence, the tomboy liked and respected her sensei very much.  He was 
similar to her in the fact that he looked shabby in his appearance and his 
black hair was often greasy and uncombed, falling around his eyes.

	&quot;I do not question your intelligence, Kino-san.  It is your clear lack of 
interest in my class over the past two days which is vexing me.  I do not 
care for any excuses, though I doubt you have any intention of giving me 
some.  You will, instead, give me 10 pages on the black hole, on my desk by 
Friday.  That is all.&quot;

	Makoto nodded and, turning quickly on one heel, left the classroom.

------------------------------------

	&quot;You&#39;re late for lunch.  You didn&#39;t get into another spat with one of the 
basketball players, did you?&quot;

	&quot;Now, Haruka, you know that wasn&#39;t her fault.  Let her be.&quot;

	Light, sky blue eyes fell slightly, looking hurt, &quot;I wasn&#39;t antagonizing 
her, Michi-chan!&quot;  The sandy blonde peered over towards the chestnut haired 
girl, who had now seated herself, and continued, &quot;I just like to keep up 
with these things so that I can prepare myself to be in the vicinity for a 
front row view.&quot;

	Makoto smiled and laughed as the delicate hand of Kaioh Michiru came 
crashing down on her girlfriend&#39;s arm accompanied by a stinging slap.  The 
tall blonde simply laughed and rubbed her upper arm, trying her best to put 
her most innocent face on.  Both girls shared a look of amusement and a 
mixture of adoration with one another before turning back to their tardy 
comrade.

	After opening her bento and shoving a spoonful of rice into her mouth, the 
emerald eyed girl decided to speak, &quot;I gobib shrubble wib nabensei.&quot;

	Michiru blinked rapidly, trying to comprehend what Makoto was saying.

	&quot;I don&#39;t speak pig, Mako-chan.  You&#39;ll have to swallow that and repeat 
yourself.&quot;  Haruka laughed at her own joke only to yell out in pain as she 
received another slap from her girlfriend.

	The aqua haired woman looked appalled between both the tall girls, confused 
as to who she should admonish first.  Turning her eyes on the sandy blonde 
sitting next her, Michiru made her decision, &quot;You&#39;re one to talk, Ruka, as I 
recall the other day having to decipher the whole 30 minute conversation you 
had with me while you were so gracefully eating peanut butter sandwiches by 
the dozen.&quot;

	&quot;I didn&#39;t eat a dozen!  It was more like... three... or four...&quot;  The blue 
eyed girl trailed off looking very reminiscent about her achievements in 
peanut butter sandwich eating.

	Makoto cleared her throat loudly and took a moment to drink the entire 
bottle of milk that she&#39;d brought with her.  After finishing it off and 
taking a deep breath, the scraggly teen spoke, &quot;I got in trouble with 
Snape-sensei.&quot;

	&quot;Ah yeah, Snape-sensei is a bit of an ass.&quot;  Haruka grunted angrily, &quot;Last 
year he assigned me a 15 page essay the same week I had state track finals.  
But I&#39;ll say this, he&#39;s not discriminating at all... he hates everyone.&quot;

	The aqua haired girl patted her girlfriends back consolingly and gave 
Makoto a similar comforting look.  The three ate in silence for the next few 
minutes, the sandy blonde seething over her old sensei the whole time.  
Emerald eyes, tired of watching the perfect couple find any chance to touch 
one another, scanned the lunch room out of boredom.

	Out of the corner of her eye, the chestnut haired tomboy noticed the Hino 
girl sitting at a table full of what looked to be several other preppy-like 
girls.  Bringing her hands up under her chin and resting her elbows on the 
table below her, Makoto looked on, unabashedly, towards the table.

	To Hino&#39;s left was a beautiful and glowing blonde girl, who was currently 
looking animatedly through a magazine and showing it to everyone at the 
table every so often.  Next to the glowing blonde girl sat a pink haired 
girl, looking thoroughly bored and very tired, yawning every so often.  
Placed on Hino&#39;s right was another blonde with, what Makoto thought to be 
blonde meatballs done up atop of her head.  The meatball head girl was 
wolfing down her lunch as though she would never eat again.  Makoto let out 
a small snicker watching the girl.

	Both Haruka and Michiru looked up from their flirting and followed green 
eyes towards the table.  The sandy blonde smirked lightly before sharing a 
look with her girlfriend.

	&quot;You know them?&quot;

	The scraggly teen turned back to her bento, poking at it with her fork 
before answering, &quot;Not really.&quot;

	Haruka nodded her head, &quot;The blondes aren&#39;t much to worry about, it&#39;s Rei 
you have to watch out for.  She&#39;s collected this small group of friends who 
she&#39;s had since junior high.  They aren&#39;t snobbish or untouchable, but Rei 
is very protective of them all.  It&#39;s almost as if she&#39;s their pimp or 
something.&quot;

	Aqua eyes shot open alarmed before smacking the blue eyed athlete to her 
left.  Emerald eyes turned back towards the table while the lovers squabbled 
about Haruka&#39;s bad behavior.  Makoto continued to watch the girls at the 
table, the raven haired girl sitting quietly looking down towards her lunch.

	&quot;And Ami-san is apart of this group?&quot;

	The sandy blonde swallowed down her bite of food and answered hastily 
before shoving another spoonful back down, &quot;Yeah, she and Rei have been 
friends since childhood, I believe.&quot;

	Makoto turned back to her own lunch and, deciding she&#39;d had enough, chucked 
it the ten feet to the trash can, just barely making it in.  &quot;What about the 
pink haired one?&quot;

	&quot;Oh, that&#39;s Tenjou Utena,&quot; the aqua eyed girl smiled mysteriously while she 
spoke, &quot;she&#39;s a somewhat recent transfer too.  I think she&#39;s only been here 
just about five months.&quot;

	&quot;Great basketball player.&quot;  Haruka&#39;s eyebrows were raised approvingly as 
she eyed Utena across the lunch room.

	&quot;We&#39;re not sure on the story, but it seems Tenjou must have known one of 
the girls or Rei herself, because she immediately began to hang out with the 
group on her first day.  As rumors go, that is.&quot;

	Emerald eyes pierced into aqua as Makoto raised one eyebrow questioningly, 
&quot;Rumors?&quot;

	Michiru sighed and gracefully brushed a strand of hair from her forehead, 
tucking it behind her ear, &quot;Yes.  A rumor that she and the blonde sitting to 
the right of Rei-san are or were dating.  They&#39;ve shown no signs of it, so 
far, though.&quot;

	&quot;REEIII-CHAN!!! YOU&#39;RE SO MEAN!!!!!&quot;

	The raven haired girl was now admonishing her blonde classmate for getting 
bits of food all over the table and telling her she was no better than a 
pig.  Meanwhile, the other two girls at the table were laughing and 
attempting to console their whimpering friend who was now crying.

	Everyone in the lunch room rolled their eyes, as they were used to 
outbursts from their meatball head classmate.  Meanwhile, Makoto let her 
thoughts wander back to the blue haired girl who danced so vividly in her 
mind.  &#39;These are the people she hangs out with on a daily basis and her 
best friend is a sexy pimp.&#39;  The tomboy marveled in the genius&#39; choice of 
friends simply because of the oddness of them.

	&quot;I wonder where Mizuno-san has been all week?  We definitely miss her in 
Calculus; she helps Haruka and me to understand what all those funny looking 
signs mean.&quot;  Michiru sighed frustratingly and took another bite of her 
curry, pouting her outer lip while chewing.

	Haruka shrugged, &quot;Eh, knowing her she&#39;s already been accepted to Tokyo U 
and wanted to get a head start.&quot;

	&quot;Speaking of Tokyo U, Ruka, have you applied to any colleges yet?&quot;  The 
aqua haired girl eyed her girlfriend suspiciously as she waited for the 
reply.

	Sky-blue eyes shot open and then looked around the lunch room, quickly 
finding a distraction, &quot;Yo! Ichigo!  How&#39;s it hanging!?&quot;  Sandy blonde hair 
bolted upright from the seat and took off before Michiru could even blink.

	After a few seconds, the beautiful artist spoke, &quot;I know she&#39;s not planning 
on going to college, Makoto-chan, she&#39;s got her heart set on racing in the 
grand prix.  But she doesn&#39;t know that I know, so it&#39;s fun to tease her.&quot;  
Leaving the chestnut haired tomboy with a wink, Michiru gracefully gathered 
what was left of her lunch and followed her blonde racer, making idle 
threats along the way.

	&#39;I wish Ami would get back to school already.&#39;  Green eyes dulled over as 
the teen sighed, leaving the lunch room in a flurry of thoughts about a 
certain baby blue eyed genius.

--------------------------------

	Setsuna sighed out of frustration for what seemed to be the seventh time 
that hour.  Squeezing her eyes tightly closed she ran her hands through her 
hair, tugging lightly at it and muttering several curses under her breath.  
After several seconds of deep breathing, the dark haired woman picked up the 
stack of papers at her desk and flipped through them rapidly, pulling out 
one of the sheets after a couple of seconds.

	&quot;Let&#39;s try 8th grade then.&quot;  Magenta eyes scanned the document, stopping 
shortly from the top, &quot;Hou 6th Street Elementary.&quot;

	Long, tanned fingers dialed the number to the school and set the phone to 
speaker, listening to the ringing for several seconds before hearing someone 
pick the phone up.

	&quot;Hou 6th Street, this is Sutosaki Asuka speaking, how may I help you?&quot;

	&quot;Ah, yes, I&#39;m in need of a transcript for Kino Makoto.&quot;

	&quot;If you need a transcript, you&#39;ll have to come in and fill out a form.  
What is this for?&quot;

	Setsuna bit back another sigh before replying, &quot;My, err, daughter is 
currently attending Juuban Senior High, and they are requiring that I show 
them her previous school records for her to continue to attend.&quot;

	&quot;They need to go back this far?  Her Junior High transcripts should be 
enough.&quot;

	&quot;I know that.&quot; The guardian could now see spots in her eyes from the amount 
of frustration rushing through her, &quot;But I cannot find the school that she 
attended during that time, thus I&#39;m hoping to find a clue from your school.&quot;

	The secretary asked Setsuna to hold on a moment and typed at the computer, 
which could only mean she was looking up something on it.  Finally!  After a 
few minutes, she spoke again, &quot;Kino Makoto.  I have her here.  She never 
actually finished schooling here.&quot;

	&quot;What!?&quot;  The dark haired woman&#39;s thoughts were reeling at the information. 
&quot;Why not?!&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t know.  The records beyond her fifth year are sealed.&quot;

	Setsuna unconsciously bit at the tip of her finger, trying to figure this 
all out.

	&quot;Ma&#39;am, are you actually this girl&#39;s mother?&quot;

	Setsuna felt her shoulders drop and her temper begin to rise again, &quot;I 
don&#39;t see how this is any of your business, but I am her guardian, and I 
have a right to know these things about her.&quot;

	Silence was the magenta eyed woman&#39;s reply from the secretary.

	&quot;Look, is there anything I can do to find out?&quot;

	&quot;Um, well, if you&#39;re her guardian, then you should be able to find out from 
a government record office, I believe.&quot;

	Shaking her head, Setsuna closed her eyes, sighing in defeat, &quot;Thank you.&quot;  
After hanging up, the dark haired woman leaned back in her seat and rubbed 
at the bridge of her nose.  &quot;What the hell happened with you Makoto?&quot;  It 
was less a question and more a statement of annoyance.

	&#39;Guess it&#39;s off to the government record office I go.&#39;  The tall woman 
smiled ruefully before reordering the papers on her desk and walking out of
