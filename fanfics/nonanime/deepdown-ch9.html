<h1>Deep Down (part 9 of 22)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/vexedfusion.html">Vexed Fusion</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/deepdown-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;Kidnapping&quot;

	&quot;They say a kiss a day keeps dry lips away.  But to be on the safe 
side, we ought to kiss several times a day.  Chapped lips could possibly 
lead to other more harmful and serious things.&quot;  Sky blue eyes danced as 
they watched the artist pretending not to listen to a word her partner 
was saying.

	Haruka watched her girlfriend through squinted eyes a moment 
before leaning in and snatching a kiss from the aqua haired girl.  
Michiru suppressed her urge to giggle and continued working on the 
painting before her.  The athlete could only cough haughtily at the lack 
of response, taking a seat on the counter and thinking up her own 
revenge to dish out towards the elegant girl before her.  

	Sandy blonde hair pressed against the window as the tall girl 
leaned back, crossing her arms in front of her chest, never breaking her 
gaze with Michiru.  The young woman was perched atop a three-legged 
wooden stool, holding the brush just above the palette in her left hand.  
She appeared to be in deep thought as she stared intently at the 
painting in front of her.  The athlete could only smile and let her eyes 
wander appreciatively over the figure before her.

	Wavy aqua hair fell down slim shoulders and an unblemished neck.  
Haruka had fallen in love with her girlfriend at a distance, admiring 
this same hair and the way the sunlight danced off it as she walked 
towards the track.  The sandy blonde haired girl had just finished a 
race and was wiping the sweat off her forehead when she saw the young 
artist looking unabashedly in her direction.  Sky blue eyes stared back 
and the athlete felt, despite having always gone to school with Michiru, 
that she was seeing the girl for the first time.

	&#39;And the rest is history of course...&#39; the tall girl thought with 
a smirk.

	Finally accepting defeat that aqua eyes would not meet her gaze, 
Haruka sought pleasures to the eye elsewhere and shifted her body to 
look out the window along the school grounds.  The grounds were empty at 
the moment as almost everyone had left for the day.  The only people 
left in the school now were busy with clubs or, like her lover, Michiru, 
working on random projects such as this painting.  The aqua haired girl 
never liked being in the art room-because it had no windows as it was in 
the basement; so the two girls decided on the empty English classroom.

	&quot;Michiru, come here.  Have you ever seen those two guys before?  
They don&#39;t go to our school... or did I miss them amongst the stoners?&quot;

	The artist looked up slowly from her painting, setting the palette 
and brush down on her stool as she stood up.  She swiftly moved towards 
the window, following her girlfriends gaze.  At the end of the school 
gates stood two shady looking young men; one tall and very lanky, with a 
mat of red hair, the other short and muscular, with a mess of black 
hair.  Neither of the boys donned Juuban school uniforms but wore a 
white t-shirt, jeans, and open trench coats.

	Aqua eyes took on a worried gaze as Michiru spoke, &quot;I&#39;ve never 
seen them before.  I hope they&#39;re not here to start trouble.&quot;

	Before the tall blonde girl had a chance to respond, a figure 
walking towards the two young men caught her eye.

	&quot;Makoto...&quot;

	Both girls shared a look before turning back to the window.

	&quot;Are they friends of hers?&quot;

	The two boys waved hesitantly towards the chestnut haired tomboy 
walking towards them at a brisk pace.  

	Michiru took Haruka&#39;s hand and squeezed it, &quot;She&#39;s got that air 
about her.  You know... the &#39;waging a war&#39; air.&quot;

	Makoto stopped about ten feet in front of the two boys, who were 
still standing just outside the school gates.  No words were exchanged 
between them.  

	&quot;It&#39;s a stare down,&quot; Haruka said excitedly, &quot;If they know 
Mako-chan though, they know that this is a battle no one on this planet 
has any chance of winning.&quot;

	The aqua haired girl could only bite her lip as she watched.  Sky 
blue eyes turned concernedly towards her partner and gently squeezed the 
other girl&#39;s hand, bringing aqua eyes to meet her own.  Michiru took a 
breath and nodded towards the athlete indicating she was fine, before 
turning back towards the window.

	&quot;The tall red haired boy is speaking!&quot;  The artist gasped 
breathlessly.

	Sandy blonde hair shook as the tall girl turned quickly towards 
the window.  She watched as the tall boy managed to stutter out a few 
words only to be silenced by Makoto who had brought her hand up while he 
spoke.  Both young men shared a look before turning back to the tomboy 
in front of them.

	Haruka jumped down off the counter, walking rapidly towards the 
door, dragging a confused Michiru behind her.  &quot;We&#39;d better get out 
there and see if our Mako-chan needs any help.  Well,&quot; the sandy blonde 
pondered, &quot;she won&#39;t need any help; I just want front row seats.&quot;
	
	The artist could only roll her eyes, following her lover 
reluctantly.

----------------------------------

	Emerald eyes looked sternly towards the two trench coated boys 
before her.  The chestnut haired tomboy became unhappy upon seeing them 
hanging about the school entrance, looking as though they were about to 
mug or jump whomever walked out of the school first.  

	&quot;Mako, we&#39;re sorry for...&quot;  The red head was cut off as the 
brutish girl brought her hand up, silencing any attempt to make 
conversation with her.

	Makoto continued to watch the two young men as they squirmed 
uncomfortably underneath her gaze.  Deciding they&#39;d had enough for now, 
Makoto took a small breath, preparing to give them both verbal lashings.  
Before she could say anything, the crashing sound of the school doors 
met her ears and she looked back briefly to see Michiru and Haruka 
walking quickly towards the three.  Out of the corner of her eye, the 
emerald eyed girl also happened to notice cat-like lavender eyes 
watching through a darkened classroom window.

	&#39;Interesting... I could use this.&#39;  The teen bared her teeth 
slightly and turned to face the two young men.  They were so engrossed 
in watching the &#39;perfect couple&#39; heading towards them from across the 
courtyard that they actually jumped when the rogue before them spoke.

	&quot;Don&#39;t ask any questions and play along, get on either side of me, 
quickly, grab my arms and drag me through the gates and around the 
corner to your right.  There you&#39;ll see an alley, we need to go fast.  
We&#39;ll go into the second door on the left.  Don&#39;t worry, it will be 
open.  Now do it!&quot;

	The two young men briefly shared a look before running on either 
side of the emerald eyed girl, each taking an arm in their hands, 
pulling the teen along.

	Through gritted teeth, Makoto whispered angrily to both of them, 
&quot;Harder!  Make it look like you&#39;re going to beat the shit out of me.&quot;

	The two didn&#39;t need to be told twice as they began to drag the 
chestnut haired girl along, aggressively, and out the gates.  The dark 
haired boy looked back before turning right with the other two.

	&quot;Mako, the blonde and his girl are running after us.&quot;

	Breaking her arms from the grasps of the two boys, Makoto began 
running towards the alley, waving for them to follow her.  They ran fast 
into the alley, knocking over a trash can and scaring three cats from 
their hiding place.  The red head yelped out frightened and stopped 
briefly before being pushed along by his shorter companion. 

	The three made it through the door and managed to shut it before 
anyone saw them.  Seconds later, they heard the sound of two sets of 
feet running along the sidewalk outside the alley.  Both girls were 
shouting out Makoto&#39;s name as they ran by.  After several minutes when 
Makoto was sure it was clear, she looked up from where she was sitting 
on the stairs, and sighed, annoyed.

	&quot;To what do I owe thee for gracing me with your pleasurable 
ambience young sirs?&quot;

	The red haired boy was still breathing heavily and nearly shrieked 
as he turned to yell at the tomboy, &quot;What the bloody hell was that all 
about?!&quot;

	&quot;Ron, tone it down, they could still be out there.&quot;  The dark 
haired boy leaned against the wall and brought a hand up to wipe the 
sweat from his forehead.

	Tiny blue eyes looked offended for a moment as the shorter boy 
spoke, but then became crestfallen as the red haired boy realized he had 
been shouting.  Ron mumbled an apology to everyone and sat down 
miserably on the cement beneath, resting his freckly head in his large 
hands.

	Two pairs of green eyes met up as the short boy looked towards his 
old friend.

	&quot;Long time no see Mako.&quot;

	&quot;Same to you, Harry.&quot;

	Harry nodded and then looked to Ron, &quot;We&#39;ve been on edge, sorry 
for his state.&quot;

	The chestnut haired tomboy cocked her head to one side and watched 
the tall red head as he tried to keep himself from hyperventilating, 
mumbling every so often.  Makoto couldn&#39;t make out what he was saying, 
exactly, but she was sure she&#39;d heard something about money, being 
killed, and, though this was a stretch, a kidnapped pet rat.

	Harry moved slowly towards his tall counterpart and kneeled down, 
resting an arm around the other boy&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;There there Ron.  
We&#39;ve found her.  It&#39;s okay now.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m not in that game anymore boys.&quot;  The roguish girl looked away 
from the two disdainfully.

	Standing up, the dark haired teen spoke firmly, &quot;Since you only 
like the facts, I&#39;ll be clear and cut with you.  We owe money.  A butt 
load of it.  The man who wants it has a bounty on our heads.  He figures 
we&#39;re worth what we owe... dead.&quot;  Green eyes looked back towards Ron 
sympathetically before turning to meet the tomboy&#39;s gaze, &quot;We&#39;ve tried 
stealing the money, but... but he&#39;s passed the word on.  We&#39;ve been shot 
at, nearly stabbed, and almost run over.  You know we wouldn&#39;t come to 
you if we didn&#39;t have any other way.&quot;

	Makoto watched Harry emotionless as he spoke, and when he was 
finished, she retorted with even less emotion, &quot;Perhaps it&#39;s time you 
paid your debt boys.  The devil has to catch up sooner or later.&quot;  
Emerald eyes had become dull and darkened as the tomboy spoke, causing 
the dark haired boy discomfort of severe proportions.

	The blue eyed boy began to quietly cry and weep in his hands, &quot;See 
Harry, I told you she&#39;d still be bitter,&quot; he said through muffled sobs.

	An airy snort escaped the rogue&#39;s lips upon hearing Ron speak.

	Kneeling back down, Harry continued his soothing ministrations to 
the lanky boy.  After mumbling a couple of gentle words to him, he 
turned his attention back towards Makoto, speaking softly, &quot;I know you 
owe us nothing.  But we only did what you told us to do, so don&#39;t hold 
that against us.  We&#39;re simply asking a favor-a favor with intent to 
repay if you get us out of it.&quot;  The short boy closed his eyes for 
several moments and then reopened them, giving the tomboy a stern look, 
&quot;We know how much you like it when people owe you.&quot;

	Makoto smiled ruefully, &quot;I don&#39;t like it,&quot; she turned her gaze 
towards the wall to her left and continued, &quot;I love it.  At least get 
that through your thick skulls.&quot;

	Ron stopped crying when she spoke and gave the other boy a very 
confused look.  Harry could only shrug his shoulders in response to his 
red headed friend and pat him on the back reassuringly.  There was a 
lengthy silence between the three in which Harry took a seat next to Ron 
on the floor, taking a pair of glasses out of his pocket and giving them 
a quick rub down before putting them on.

	Dropping his jaw lightly, the short teen looked over the tomboy 
with silent shock.  The girl he saw now was very different from the one 
he knew several years ago; she looked like someone kicked her in the 
gutter, chewed her up, spit her out, and then stomped on her for hours 
on end-and then repeated from the beginning.

	&quot;Things happened, but I&#39;m still Kino Makoto.&quot;  The tomboy spoke as 
though reading her dark haired friends mind.

	Harry could only laugh, &quot;Stop that Mako-chan.  You know I hate it 
when you read our thoughts.&quot;
	
	The tomboy shrugged, &quot;It&#39;s a gift, what can I say?&quot;

	Both teens let silence drift across them again as they reminisced 
quietly.  Ron watched the two a moment, obviously worried, and then 
stood up abruptly, startling Harry.  Two sets of green eyes turned their 
gaze on the tall red head as he clenched his jaw, deep in thought.  
After a deep breath, he brought his tiny blue eyes up towards the rogue.

	&quot;What happened to your leg?  Rather, I mean, what happened to you?  
Tsukasa that little bastard, he moved north somewhere, putting all the 
blame on you.  We never saw either of you after that...&quot;  The red head 
trailed off and leaned backwards against the wall, wrapping his lengthy 
arms around his thin frame.  He noticed that when they were running, the 
tomboy was limping slightly on her left leg, but made no indication that 
it hurt.  He therefore concluded that the wound must be an old one.

	The dark haired boy could only stare at the floor as he silently 
wondered about the questions himself.  Somewhere in the back of his 
mind, though, he knew the tomboy would never share what happened.  She 
always had a knack for keeping secrets, secret.

	 Makoto leaned her head against the railing along the stairs and 
closed her eyes.  After several seconds, without opening her eyes, she 
finally responded, &quot;The devil caught up with me.&quot;

	Two sets of eyes shot upwards at the roguish girl.  Neither boy 
knew what to say to this and simply reverted back into silence.  It was 
only after a minute that Harry slowly took to his feet and tapped Ron&#39;s 
shoulder, motioning for him to stand next to him.  Both boys shared a 
look before turning towards Makoto.

	&quot;Listen, don&#39;t worry about this, we&#39;ll take care of it.  Get on 
with your life.&quot;  Green eyes became solemn as the boy spoke.

	The tomboy caught the two young men off guard when she smiled, 
opening her eyes to reveal a pair of dancing emeralds.

	&quot;Have a seat; tell me, how much do you owe... exactly?&quot;

---------------------------------------

	&quot;Ami-chan, c&#39;mooon, you can&#39;t tell me that you don&#39;t think she&#39;s 
cute.  It was written obvious as day all over your face earlier!&quot;

	&quot;Oh leave her be Minako, she&#39;s as red as a tomato.&quot;  Stormy blue 
eyes cast a reproachful glance on the blonde.

	Minako turned swiftly towards the stormy blue eyes and stuck her 
tongue out, blowing a raspberry.  The pink haired girl could only laugh 
in response, shaking her head at the obvious immaturity of the 
situation.  The sound of the locker door closing brought the two girls 
out of their reverie.  Both turned to the blue haired girl, who hadn&#39;t 
moved from in front of her locker yet.

	The blonde was about to resume her teasing when the genius spoke 
softly, &quot;Its things like these that make me want to stay as far away 
from that rogue as possible.&quot;  She sighed softly as she spoke, adjusting 
the glasses on her face and turning to meet her peers&#39; worried gazes, 
&quot;And yet, those same things make me want to be near her, trying to solve 
the mystery that she is.&quot;

	&quot;Umm... Ami, what are you talking about?&quot;  Minako fixed the blue 
haired girl with a very perplexing look.

	Movement from the pink haired girl caught the blonde&#39;s attention.  
She watched as Utena reached out slowly towards the genius and pulled 
the note out from between her fingertips, keeping her eyes fixated on 
the shorter girl, silently seeking approval that it was okay to take it.  
When she received no apparent objection, the pink haired girl unfolded 
the piece of paper and began to read it silently.  

	After several seconds, she read the note out loud, &quot;It is in your 
best interest to stay away from Kino Makoto.  Nothing good can come from 
associating with her as she is a juvenile with a record.  She has also 
killed a man.  I hope you take this information to heart and stay away.  
Stay away.&quot;

	Minako had brought her hands up over her mouth in alarm as the 
pink haired girl spoke.  She turned to watch Ami, who looked as though 
she was in deep thought about something.

	&quot;It doesn&#39;t say anything else, and since it was printed on 
computer paper, we can&#39;t match up any handwriting.&quot;  The basketball 
player sighed and turned the paper over several times, as though looking 
for a clue, &quot;Why should we believe this person?  They could simply be 
blowing smoke because Kino-san gives off such a bad aura.  Also, if she 
killed someone, don&#39;t you think she&#39;d be serving time for it?&quot;

	The blonde girl nodded enthusiastically, &quot;Yeah Ami-chan!  No need 
to get upset!  People just don&#39;t like her and probably can&#39;t stand it 
that she likes you.&quot;

	Baby blue eyes widened in surprise at what Minako said and the 
young girl turned red again, stuttering as she replied, &quot;S-she doesn&#39;t 
like me.  Wh-what makes you th-think that?&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s so obvious Ami!  She&#39;s always staring at you during English 
and in the hallways, when you&#39;re not staring at her, that is.  Not too 
mention she&#39;s asked Haruka and Michiru about you.  The New Transfer is 
totally into you.&quot;  Minako flashed bright white teeth and squealed with 
utter delight.  &quot;She is so sexy with that Villain-ish look about her.  
But I bet she&#39;s nothing but sugary sweetness underneath that rough 
exterior.  You know what they say; you can never judge the amount of 
eggs by counting their covers.&quot;

	Utena nearly fell over before correcting her bubbly friend, &quot;You 
mean you can&#39;t judge a book by its cover.&quot;

	Sparkling blue eyes blinked rapidly and became wide as doe eyes, 
&quot;That&#39;s what I said Utena-chan!&quot;  Minako laughed uncontrollably, 
slapping the pink haired girl on the back.

	The blue haired girl couldn&#39;t help but giggle at the scene before 
her.  Reaching out a delicate hand, she grasped the note out of Utena&#39;s 
grip and folded it up, carefully sliding it into her book bag.  After 
smoothing out her skirt and shirt, the young girl smiled 
enthusiastically at her friends, speaking just as cheerfully, &quot;You&#39;re 
probably right Utena-chan.  Besides, it&#39;s none of my business what 
happened in her past.  Even if it is true, I&#39;d like to believe that 
people can change.&quot;

	Minako draped an arm around the shorter girl&#39;s shoulders, &quot;You&#39;re 
right as always Ami-chan.&quot;  The blonde glanced briefly at the pink 
haired girl to her right, &quot;People can change.&quot;	
	
	Utena pretended not to notice the tone in the volleyball player&#39;s 
voice as she spoke and nonchalantly picked up her bag from the floor, 
walking in pace next to the other two girls.  The three walked through 
the school, both Utena and Ami pretending to ignore Minako&#39;s gossip, but 
listening very intently instead.  As they rounded the corner, they saw 
the familiar sight of their fiery friend, Rei.

	Lavender eyes turned to meet the three girls and immediately the 
sexy teen ran over to Ami, taking her hands in her own.

	&quot;Ami-chan, promise me you&#39;ll stay away from that Kino Makoto!&quot;

	Baby blue eyes became wide with shock and the young genius opened 
her mouth to speak only to find nothing to say.

	&quot;Why?&quot; Utena asked in the waking silence.

	The dark haired girl clenched her jaw slightly, her facial 
features becoming slightly frightening as she spoke, &quot;I was looking for 
my phoenix pin in Snape-sensei&#39;s classroom and when I looked out the 
window, I saw that brute talking with two suspicious looking guys.  And 
before I knew it, they&#39;d grabbed a hold of her and dragged her off the 
school grounds!&quot;

	Minako and Ami both gasped loudly.

	&quot;How long ago was this Rei?!&quot;  Utena nearly shouted as she spoke, 
her stormy blue eyes glazing over with frenzy.

	The dark haired teen merely shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know, 
probably about five minutes ago.  Why?&quot;

	Pink hair turned hastily towards the doors that lead out to the 
school grounds, &quot;Which way did they go?!&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re not seriously thinking of helping her?!  Those guys looked 
crooked; they probably have guns or something!&quot;

	Utena turned back towards lavender eyes, &quot;Did you at least call 
the police?!&quot;

	Rei looked as though someone had just slapped her in the face, 
&quot;Why should it be my duty to call the police for that girl&#39;s affairs?!&quot;  
She was screaming now, not caring who saw her, &quot;SHE DESERVES WHAT YOU 
GET IF YOU ASK ME!  I KNEW THERE WASN&#39;T SOMETHING RIGHT WITH THAT GIRL 
FROM THE MOMENT SHE STEPPED FOOT IN THIS SCHOOL!&quot;

	&quot;DESERVES WHAT SHE GETS?!  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU 
HINO-SAN!?&quot;  

	Blue eyes had gone from storm to hurricane in half a second and 
the pink haired girl stepped up face to face with blazing lavender eyes.  
The two girls stared at one another for what seemed like an eternity, 
waiting to see if the other would spark the challenge of the fight.  

	&quot;Yes, hello, Police, I&#39;d like to report a kidnapping.&quot;

	Both Utena and Rei looked towards Minako who had her cell phone up 
to her ear, looking positively fretful.  Upon feeling two sets of eyes 
on her, the blonde gave both girls an admonishing look and continued to 
report the incident to the police.  Utena, still feeling slightly 
enraged, now felt very guilty as well and turned to the dark haired 
girl, mumbling an apology.

	Rei could only flare her nostrils in response and turned towards 
the blue haired girl.  All anger washed away from the dark haired teen, 
only to be replaced by the guilt of the world as she saw teary baby blue 
eyes full of panic.  Lavender eyes closed, consciously fighting off 
their own tears, and the sexy teen wrapped an arm around Ami, hugging 
her tightly.  She ran her other hand through the genius&#39; short hair and 
mumbled to her softly that she was sorry.

	The pink haired girl had walked over to the window and was staring 
out it towards the gates, still feeling very upset.  Utena silently 
prayed that the rogue would be okay, not only for her own sake, but for 
Ami&#39;s sake as well.  Stormy blue eyes turned upon feeling a warm hand 
placed over hers and met up with a pair of teary, but still sparkling 
blue eyes.

	&quot;The police are on their way,&quot; Minako smiled lightly, though it 
was evident she felt like anything but smiling, &quot;Makoto will be alright, 
it&#39;s evident she can handle herself,&quot; the blonde turned back towards 
where Rei and Ami were, &quot;surprisingly, I&#39;m more worried about Ami-chan 
at the moment.  Weird, huh?&quot;

	Utena could only smile and laced her fingers with the volleyball 
players.  Both girls turned to look back out the window, awaiting the 
impending sirens.</pre>
