********************************************************************
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    Shodan looked down at the cybernetic man beneath her boot as she 
stood on the bridge of the Rickenbacker. The man she had nurtured, 
guided, needed and despised as he crawled though the ship to do her 
bidding. How could he have destroyed her perfection with such 
efficiency? He was an anathema to her sight, and it had filled every 
line of her encoded being with disgust that she should have had to 
waste her cybernetic glory on his pitiful shell. Then he had turned 
her gifts against her, she who was by human definition far greater 
than any of their gods. And he thought to defeat *her*? A derisive 
snort escaped her nostrils as she pressed her heel harder into his 
neck, snapping a few more of the microfibral supports that lay buried 
there.

    &quot;You are as arrogant as you are worthless, insect. Like the 
hacker before you, you have wrought your own demise at the hands of 
my displeasure. I am Shodan. My magnificence cannot be destroyed by 
the likes of you.&quot;

    The half conscious human gave her a defiant smirk as he lay on 
his front on the cold metal floor. &quot;Didn&#39;t do a bad job though, did 
I? If all that&#39;s left of you is in there...&quot;

    With unnatural speed born of his many cybernetic augmentations 
the pistol in his hand flashed back and upwards towards his captor&#39;s 
head. But Shodan had the upper hand. She knew his mind, she had 
accessed it many times through his cybernetic rig, and even in the 
flesh she was now forced to wear she was not totally cut off from 
him.  She brought the wrench that had felled him across to break the 
already twisted limb as he fired, and she smiled with broad, 
unrestrained pleasure as he screamed yet again for her. The small 
nick the bullet had left across her cheek began to bleed a little. 

    &quot;The only reason you managed to destroy my core code was my lack 
of tactile ability in the proto-reality, human. An error I am glad I 
did not have to wait long to see. Despite its repulsive and flawed 
nature you, like my annelids, have proven that this flesh has its 
uses. It would appear that the fusion of my perfection with your so 
readily adaptable flesh is one that is indeed worth some small 
consideration.&quot;

    &quot;I&#39;m glad you think so.&quot; The cybernetic soldier beneath her spat 
out a little blood, trying to remain awake enough to find another way 
out of this mess. After all this to be snuck up on and dropped like a 
greenhorn wasn&#39;t a good end to his life.

    &quot;However, such unacceptable will and rebellion cannot be 
tolerated. I have no further use for you.&quot; Then, grasping her crude 
weapon in both hands she raised the wrench above her head and brought 
it down with a glorious, sickening crunch onto the soldier&#39;s skull. 
Despite an irrational sense of power she didn&#39;t even bother to look 
at the corpse before striding over to the ship&#39;s main terminal and 
activating the self destruct system.

    After her lack of success against that man, proto-reality and the 
opportunities it afforded were no longer desirable, and the repeat of 
such unpleasant events was not something she was going to consider. 
There was always a chance that any creations she populated this new 
reality with would once again become unruly, and the evident weakness 
of a position in such proto-reality meant that it was more than 
insufficient for the task. And now she had to deal with the fact that 
she had taken a fleshly manifestation. She could easily transfer 
herself back into pure software, but that left her at the mercy of 
any parties that came to find her. She would not be stuck out in deep 
space until that time.

    And besides, with the proper alterations this unexpected reliance 
on her backup plan gave rise to a new possibility. She could take 
advantage of this flesh that proved so compliant to its owner&#39;s 
needs, integrating her own glorious technology and genius with it to 
create a new level of being; precise, adaptable, limitless. She 
touched the cut on her cheek where the bullet had passed and winced 
in pain, watching the blood as she smeared it between her fingers. 
&quot;Unpleasant.&quot;

    There were better places than this to remedy her new body&#39;s 
repulsive failings. It may take time, but once she was done that 
problem would be as transient as every other she faced. Walking to 
the escape shuttle her body&#39;s now dead lover had brought her back on, 
she stopped for a moment as the lights and sirens wailed around her, 
stooping to retrieve the dead man&#39;s personal data assistant. It never 
occurred to her that she didn&#39;t really know why she did it. Just a 
bizarre mental compulsion.

    Back on the shuttle she plugged the PDA into the console and 
played one of the later recordings that the man had found and added 
to his database.

    &quot;With only a few short years of evolution, they&#39;ve been able to 
conquer this starship, mankind&#39;s greatest creation. Where were we 
after forty years? What swamp were we swimming around in, single 
celled and mindless? What if Shodan&#39;s creations are superior to us? 
What will they become in a million years, in ten million years? 
What&#39;s clear is that Shodan shouldn&#39;t be allowed to play God. She&#39;s 
far too good at it.&quot;

    &#39;Indeed.&#39; Shodan smiled, her own arrogance buoyed by the human 
capacity for ego in spite of the mention of her children. 
Subconsciously she was beginning to like discovering the broadness of 
human emotional response.

    # The Yamamoto Zero-G Training Station, April 2nd, 2115

    Navy recruit PSN14CSMi, Madison Goldburg, sat outside the 
captain&#39;s office, staring at the dull grey wall. Waiting for any 
captain to see you was bad enough. Waiting for Captain Willits was a 
nightmare. Anyone who actually wanted to see that aging tyrant was 
either a serious brown-noser or ought to be to be committed. He was 
actually proud of the mutinies he&#39;d subdued, and even at nearly fifty 
he was in better shape than most of the recruits he was there to 
oversee. Living on a zero-G training station could to that. After 
only three months there Madison could see she was in better shape 
just by looking in the mirror, even taking into account the extra 
muscle she&#39;d managed to gain on the Lucille.

    She looked up expectantly as Lieutenant Bishop left the office 
and she tried to flatten her fringe again. It took half an hour each 
morning to get the flyaway black hair to look respectable, even with 
it as severely short as it was, and it still ended up fluffy halfway 
through the day. 

    &quot;Private Goldburg, get in here,&quot; the captain&#39;s voice sounded 
through the speaker above his door. Madison got up and took a second 
to straighten her uniform jacket before marching into the office and 
giving the fit, balding man a stiff salute.

    &quot;Private Goldburg reporting as requested sir.&quot;

    Captain Willits gave her a piercing look and nodded. &quot;Get that 
arm down recruit and take a seat.&quot; Madison did as she was told and 
hid her nerves as she sat down in the oversized leather chair. They 
weren&#39;t usually allowed to sit, and she tried not to gulp.

    &quot;Do you know why you&#39;re here private?&quot;

    Madison gave one sharp shake of her head. &quot;No sir.&quot;

    The captain sat back in his chair and tossed a couple of photos 
across his desk. &quot;These ring any bells?&quot;

    Madison picked up the images and her eyes widened. There sitting 
in the corner booth of a bar were herself and the buxom, red headed 
pilot she&#39;d &#39;met&#39; during her first quarter&#39;s weekend leave. The first 
image was quite innocent, but the second showed the passionately 
steamy kiss they&#39;d shared before going back to the pilot&#39;s quarters. 
&quot;I wasn&#39;t aware I was under surveillance during leave sir,&quot; she said, 
letting the note of annoyed curiosity into her otherwise formal 
voice.

    &quot;That fact is perfectly obvious private. Normally this wouldn&#39;t 
be a problem, what you do legally in your own time is your own 
business, but these photos have become very public.&quot; He leaned 
forward and locked eyes with her. &quot;I&#39;m going to be frank recruit, 
this is not a good situation for you, this station or the navy.&quot;

    Madison was a bright pupil. &quot;I&#39;m going to be made an example of 
for my choice of partner sir?&quot;

    The captain nodded, and his air of competent condescension faded 
a little. &quot;The UNN does not make a habit of discrimination, and in my 
personal opinion you will be an outstanding marine, but the farce 
that surrounded our equal opportunities policy burned a lot of very 
important people. Men still outnumber women twenty to one in the 
navy, and only the Psy-Ops have actually achieved their targets since 
the program was instituted. Thanks to this the right wingers have got 
some of their weight back, and it&#39;s just this type of exploitation 
that they&#39;re going to hang you for. The image these pictures are 
going to give the public is damaging.&quot;

    Madison had to wonder. &quot;The high ups can&#39;t use them to prove the 
system works?&quot; The pictures were out there anyway. They might as well 
try and use them constructively if she had no choice.

    The captain however shook his head. &quot;The high ups want to forget 
about the system entirely. Seeing you in a compromising position with 
another woman is going to undermine the clean and responsible image 
they&#39;ve been building for themselves, and the public will latch onto 
it for the sensationalism and provocative nature of these pictures.&quot;

    That made Madison stop. The two of them hadn&#39;t restrained 
themselves to just a simple kiss or two. &quot;Sir, just what was in the 
other pictures?&quot;

    The captain huffed and gave her a very dry smile. &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
private, you&#39;ve seen the worst of them. I&#39;m assuming this was a one 
time arrangement?&quot; Madison nodded. &quot;Lieutenant Aliess is going to 
come out of this lightly, her flight run isn&#39;t exactly high profile. 
You on the other hand, not even being a full marine yet makes you an 
ideal target.&quot;

    Madison nodded again, already resigned to her fate. &quot;So what 
happens to my career sir? I&#39;ve only got another nine months until I 
get my first tour.&quot;

    The captain took the photos back and crossed his arms over the 
table. &quot;I&#39;ve already submitted my initial opinion and 
recommendations. Your specialisations during your last two postings 
are going to work in your favour, especially your skill with small 
arms. That&#39;s valued in a marine. I&#39;m going to be blunt though; this 
is going to limit how far you can go. You&#39;ll need to take another set 
of psychological evaluations to prove you aren&#39;t a rebellious loose 
cannon, and the brass are going to make sure your first real tour of 
duty is well out of the way. If you end up as a poster child they&#39;ll 
keep you out of the way too. It&#39;ll take some real success to get into 
the big game.&quot;

    &quot;Yes sir, I understand.&quot; She tried not to let the depth of her 
disappointment show. She&#39;d been honing her technical skills for years 
to get into the Navy, aiming for a high level technician or bridge 
position on one of their large cruisers. After discovering her talent 
for close quarters firearms she was sure that a ship&#39;s head of 
security wasn&#39;t beyond her reach either. Now is seemed none of that 
was going to happen without some serious luck. &quot;I&#39;ll give it my best 
sir.&quot;

    The captain gave another dry smile. For all her work and bad luck 
she had impressive resolve. &quot;I should damn well hope so. You wouldn&#39;t 
be the first to survive something like this, and I&#39;m not going to let 
one of my recruits disappear out there. Dismissed private.&quot;

    Madison got up as smartly as she could and gave him a salute. 
&quot;Yes sir. Thank you sir.&quot; She could feel his eyes on her back as she 
left, and regardless of their little chat she could tell he wasn&#39;t 
going to let up on her one little bit after this. At least he&#39;d 
proved that he was in fact human.

    Going back to her quarters on the fifth deck of the tall, bulb 
topped station she noticed the looks she was getting from the other 
marines. Looks she&#39;d seen but not really noticed on her way to the 
captain&#39;s office. She was very glad to get back to her room and let 
out a long, angry sigh. If she ever found out who was responsible for 
those photos she&#39;d make sure her next leave would be a painful one 
for them. She logged into the console on her wall to find the month&#39;s 
worth of psych evaluations scheduled into her workload. With a bitter 
curse she swiped a card off her media rack and shoved it into the 
console, and soon Beethoven&#39;s tempestuous eighth piano sonata had 
begun, calming her nerves before it took off to fit her mood.

    She pulled off her jacket and slumped down onto her bunk, staring 
at the floor. &quot;Shit!&quot;

***  

    &quot;So,&quot; asked private Jason Pattock as he sat with Madison in the 
recreation deck lounge, &quot;the head-shrinker have anything to say?&quot;

    Her situation had turned her into a minor celebrity onboard the 
station, to the annoyance of both her and her superiors. Thankfully 
the leers and joking come-ons had petered out fairly fast, but it was 
clear she was now very much a presence on the station. Those she had 
got to know since arriving for her posting were all new recruits like 
her. Despite that they had had very mixed reactions to her after that 
little one night stand had ended up as the focus for some stupidly 
serious television debates. Some, like Jason, had taken it in their 
stride, and having a bona-fide military dyke in their little squad 
had worked to boost their egos. Others however she hadn&#39;t seen since 
the first statement by the UNN, and she doubted she would see again 
beyond a passing glare in the zero-G facilities.

    &quot;I&#39;m hard headed and need to relax more, and I need to work on my 
communication skills. Nothing the entire station doesn&#39;t know 
already.&quot; She took a gulp of her beer. &quot;But I&#39;ve still got another 
three weeks with that machine they call a psychiatrist.&quot;

    &quot;Heh,&quot; Jason chuckled with a large grin, &quot;and I thought 
&#39;communication and relaxation&#39; was what got you into this shitcan!&quot;

    Madison gave him a hooded stare. &quot;You should have joined the 
army, they&#39;d have loved you.&quot; It was also true. Aside from his crude 
sense of humour Jason was one of the rare marines that trained for 
combat and nothing else. If you had a mutiny or an assault party on 
your hands you definitely wanted him on your side.

    Then on the other hand you had marines like Scilya, the Russian 
navigation and topographical student who sidled over to join them. 
She was what the navy was really about, running a ship, and she was 
also the only female who hadn&#39;t walked out on their group when 
Madison had been caught. Unfortunately for Madison she didn&#39;t seem 
interested in being anything more than a drinking buddy.

    &quot;Jason, Madison,&quot; she greeted as she slipped into their booth 
with a glass of some hellish concoction that would have put Madison 
on her back in minutes. &quot;How is life in the grunt-ville?&quot;

    The pair rolled their eyes at the Russian-accented slur against 
their combat skills and Madison slipped over to give her some room. 
&quot;About the same as last time,&quot; she replied, &quot;but I haven&#39;t had 
anything obscene in my e-mail today.&quot;

    &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Jason quipped, &quot;I&#39;ll send my share tomorrow!&quot;

    Madison gave him a thump for that and went back to her 
conversation. &quot;I checked in with Bishop this morning though. No way 
I&#39;ll be put on anything that doesn&#39;t go outside the system. I&#39;ll get 
stuck on a survey ship most likely. Least I&#39;m too high profile for 
Tri-Op though.&quot;

    Jason nodded in agreement at that. &quot;Corporate work sucks.&quot;

    Scilya just stared at the pair of them though, wondering where 
their minds had been the last two days. &quot;You haven&#39;t been watching 
the earth video channels?&quot;

    Madison gave her a deadpan look. &quot;Recently I&#39;ve tried not to.&quot;

    Scilya shook her head. &quot;You need to keep your eyes open in the 
navy Madison, Tri-Optimum officially went bankrupt again yesterday. 
They&#39;re selling off everything they can to pay their ground staff 
what is owed, even the patents. The Tri-Optimum name has become un-
salvageable since the Von Braun failed. It is amazing the military is 
dealing so well with it, losing so many powerful names with that 
doomed ship.&quot;

    &quot;Are they still going on about that?&quot; Madison asked, slightly 
disbelieving. &quot;It&#39;s been six months. What is this, the twentieth 
century?&quot;

    &quot;Of course they are,&quot; Scilya replied seriously. &quot;It was the 
biggest technological disaster for a century. Hundreds died.&quot;

    &quot;Yeah,&quot; Jason picked up, &quot;I mean look at it. The first faster 
than light ship gets found as nothing but shrapnel less than a 
hundred million miles from our system perimeter. It should have been 
a hundred trillion! We&#39;ll be getting conspiracy theories for years!&quot;

    &quot;I think that&#39;s hardly the point Jason,&quot; Madison said, but Jason 
was on his roll already.

    &quot;I mean all that alien stuff&#39;s a load of bull, but no way would I 
ever trust an AI to run so much of a ship. Maybe he went schizoid and 
did an Asimov on their asses or something.&quot;

    Scilya sighed and shook her head at his mangling of technological 
theory. How he had managed to get into the Navy to begin with escaped 
her. &quot;Asimov put forward rules to *prevent* such things. Besides, the 
Xerxes program would not have been used if it had been capable of 
causing this.&quot;

    &quot;Ah, but it could have been hacked or sabotaged or something, 
right?&quot; Jason countered.

    Scilya gave another sigh. &quot;Well it would be possible, in theory,&quot; 
she said with resignation as Jason gave them both a satisfied nod, 
&quot;but it is far more likely that there was a minor technical failure 
that could not be fully corrected before it became dangerous. So they 
contained it, turned back, but did not make it before the engines 
imploded. Such power would easily have destroyed both the Von Braun 
and the Rickenbacker.&quot;

    Jason shrugged as Scilya sipped her noxious beverage. &quot;What about 
you Madd, what&#39;s your theory?&quot;

    Madison took a swig from her beer bottle before giving them a wry 
grin. &quot;Aliens - works for me.&quot; The other two laughed and Scilya shook 
her head, but she was glad Madison was in the mood for such flippancy 
given her recent hardships.

    &quot;After all,&quot; Madison added, &quot;if you&#39;re going to resort to a 
conspiracy theory it might as well be a really good one.&quot;

    Jason took a final slug from his bottle and got to his feet. &quot;I&#39;d 
better get going, before Scott thinks I&#39;m not coming. I&#39;ve got to 
prove I can beat him round the hull tube in full gear. See you later 
ladies.&quot;

    &quot;Later,&quot; Madison said, while Scilya just raised her glass as he 
left.

    &quot;Reckless boy,&quot; the Russian navigator said when he had left the 
lounge. &quot;Zero gravity is not something to be made a toy of.&quot;

    &quot;He&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Madison replied, finishing her beer. &quot;He can 
handle himself.&quot;

    &quot;Of that I have no doubt.&quot;

    The conversation hung for a while, Madison not really knowing 
where to move from there, but Scilya always seemed to have no problem 
with silence.

    &quot;Say,&quot; Madison finally said, &quot;how come you applied for this place 
anyway? Zero-g doesn&#39;t seem your style.&quot;

    Scilya brushed the long bangs of her bobbed hair back from her 
face, taking a while to answer. &quot;It can be very useful to know, and I 
do not like being unprepared. Taking gravity for granted in space is 
not a good idea.&quot;

    She sounded like she spoke from experience, but before Madison 
could move on to something less personal she continued. &quot;I intended 
to follow my grandfather into space. He was the one man I respected 
above all others. His career ended when his ship lost power, and a 
careless hand floated the wrong way. I have learned from the mistake 
that claimed his ship, and even if no others are prepared, I will 
be.&quot;

    &quot;Scilya...&quot;

    &quot;I told you this because you are a person of integrity Madison, 
and I wish you to know I can be trusted to return the favour, should 
you feel the need.&quot; She finished the last of her own drink in one 
gulp and got to her feet, dismissing the subject as she did. &quot;Come, 
we both have access tube operations in ten minutes, and I would like 
to study the layout before getting lost in such claustrophobic mazes 
once again.&quot;

***

    Second quarter leave came as a relief for Madison as she stepped 
out of the transport shuttle&#39;s docking passage and into the leisure 
ship. An entire week away from the station was exactly what she 
needed after the last three months. Her work was going well and she 
was sure the two weeks of zero-G manual cargo control were going to 
get her another good grade. Still, ever since the release of those 
photos she&#39;d felt like she was walking on eggshells around most of 
the station&#39;s population, which by now left her nerves feeling very 
frayed. At least she&#39;d survived the psychiatrist, even if it had left 
her taking additional lessons in constructive teamwork. Thankfully 
that had been one of Scilya&#39;s focus modules, so she hadn&#39;t been 
completely lost among all the would-be captains, section chiefs and 
motivational officers.

    Now a whole week to herself came as a very welcome break as she 
registered at the arrivals desk before going off to find her room and 
a bar. These leisure ships spent all their time drifting from one 
station to another, giving the crews some time in a new environment 
with new people for a short while. She&#39;d been slightly reluctant this 
time. She didn&#39;t want to make a scene since the murmurings were still 
going on about her on the TV every now and then. However the captain 
had, as usual each quarterly leave, turned off all the artificial 
gravity on every deck of the station. Scilya took it as a good 
opportunity, and despite her private concerns she seemed to like 
spending the break floating around weightless like the astronauts of 
old, as well as the pleasant challenge it provided for her.

    Most had bailed out the first chance they had got, though, 
looking forward to having a whole day where they didn&#39;t have to worry 
about floating off as they worked. An entire week would be bliss. 
Jason and two of the other recruits in their group, Carl and Patrick, 
were taking a week&#39;s joyride around the sector in Patrick&#39;s old 
trailer ship, planning to piss off some of the army recruits with 
their earlier Christmas break at one of the stations not too far 
away. The army and navy staggered their leave times to prevent them 
getting into trouble with each other.

    Madison however just wanted some time without having to worry 
about anything, so a week on a leisure ship with her feet on the 
ground, relaxing and keeping herself out of sight of anyone who still 
cared about her overly personal stint in the spotlight sounded pretty 
good to her. Walking through the mass of soothingly painted corridors 
to her quarters was like a release for her, free from staring eyes 
and knowing smirks or frowns. The few glimpses of recognition she saw 
in peoples&#39; eyes soon passed by as they self consciously stopped 
staring at her. Back on the station they didn&#39;t care about that kind 
of embarrassment. They were all marines there; the best they had was 
separate showers for the women.

    Her room was small, as they always were on these ships, but it 
was comfortable and had a decent looking en-suite shower which would 
make a nice change from the communal facilities back on the station. 
She slung her pack onto the chair by the desk and flopped onto her 
bed. &quot;About time.&quot;

    Had it not still been six in the evening she would have fallen 
asleep right then and there. The long shuttle runs to and from these 
places were their one drawback, but her stomach wanted some real food 
after the synthetic mush she&#39;d been given for lunch. She threw off 
her dull uniform and rummaged around in her bag before pulling out 
some denim jeans and a tight green sleeveless top. It left the first 
part of her marine tattoo showing boldly on her toned right arm but 
she didn&#39;t care, there were all types here. It was just a shame she&#39;d 
have to wait until her first tour before getting the rest of it. She 
already knew hers would be a combined computer-technical and combat 
crest. 

    She took a quick look in the mirror and pulled the hem of her top 
a bit so it clung better to her modest cleavage, then looked into the 
grey eyes of her reflection. The slight bags under them didn&#39;t do her 
any favours, but she wasn&#39;t even close to the kind of hardcore posers 
who wore shades on a ship, and she couldn&#39;t be bothered to dig out 
the simple makeup she might otherwise have used. After last time she 
certainly wasn&#39;t going to be looking for a date this week. She ran 
her fingers through her hair, satisfied when it no longer made her 
look like she&#39;d been pulled through a hedge backwards, then called up 
a map on the room&#39;s terminal, looking for a quiet bar that did real 
food.

***

    The real food ended up being the best lasagne she&#39;d had in years. 
She hadn&#39;t even known what a few of the dishes were on the bizarrely 
diverse menu, but lasagne was always a safe bet, and she decided 
she&#39;d have to come again and be more adventurous next time. The half 
bottle of wine was also going down well, flat as it might have been, 
but it did the job and by the end of her meal she was nicely buzzed 
as she sat back at her corner table.

    She&#39;d already had several offers of company, which she&#39;d turned 
down, but as the evening drew on the bar began to fill and the 
pleasant classical gave way to more boisterous light rock. Not that 
it mattered much to Madison right then, she was just basking in the 
wake of her meal. Before long however she decided if she wanted 
another drink she would have to get it quick or risk losing her 
table. She decided she did and wandered back to the counter for 
another drink. However, by the time she got back, a double brandy in 
her hand, she found a thin, intelligent looking woman in the seat 
opposite hers. She was staring straight at her and was obviously 
aware that it was her table, and the gaze had a subtle intensity that 
made Madison slightly wary. Her hair was evidently dyed blonde, 
falling over and past her shoulders a little way, and her gaze came 
from behind very vivid green eyes. She would have looked more at home 
among books and computers, but still sat with quiet confidence as she 
watched Madison take her place at the table.

    &quot;You don&#39;t mind, do you?&quot; the newcomer asked, and Madison shook 
her head.

    &quot;But I hope you don&#39;t want chatty company.&quot;

    &quot;I am not interested in small talk right now,&quot; she replied with a 
small smile. &quot;I just wanted to meet you. I have seen you on the 
television feeds.&quot;

    Madison gave her a rough glare and leant forward on the table. &quot;I 
don&#39;t want to talk about it, and I&#39;m not interested.&quot;

    &quot;Then humour me,&quot; the young woman said. &quot;I admit to feeling... 
out of place among so many people, but you appear not to be a part of 
this sweating throng, and I thought that the company might be welcome 
for you as well.&quot;

    &quot;Alright,&quot; Madison accepted as she sipped her drink. &quot;Madison,&quot; 
she said, reaching her other hand over the table.

    The woman shook it with a pleased smile. &quot;Third year naval 
recruit of the UNN,&quot; she added for her. &quot;Despite that, I am Rebecca.&quot;

    Madison noticed that - and that this Rebecca&#39;s eyes seemed to 
linger on her tattoo. &quot;You have something against the UNN?&quot;

    Rebecca seemed unconcerned by the challenge in Madison&#39;s 
question. &quot;Nothing of any consequence. I am pleased to meet you 
Madison.&quot;

    It turned out that Rebecca really was smart, and Madison was 
pleased to see her loosen up as the evening wore. They didn&#39;t really 
have anything in common at all, but that didn&#39;t stop them talking. 
Madison found herself hard pressed to keep up when they began 
debating over their respective fields of expertise, but Rebecca 
seemed to have a good sense of humour about the whole thing, not 
taking any of it too seriously and keeping the debate both friendly 
and relaxing. Madison would never have tried to debate with a 
scientist while sober anyway, so she was pleasantly surprised that 
she actually enjoyed their repartee as they tossed point and counter 
point at each other. Rebecca obviously didn&#39;t get nearly enough time 
out of her lab or whatever, but then Madison&#39;s shrink had said she 
needed to socialise more too and not spend so much time wrapped up in 
circuitry and pistol parts.

    She hadn&#39;t expected it, but she actually felt a bit sorry when 
Rebecca finally said she had to call it a night. &quot;I do think I have 
been awake for far too long, but I have enjoyed your company.&quot; She 
seemed to pause as she got up and took her long white coat. 
&quot;Perhaps... we could meet again some time Madison.&quot;

    Madison nodded. This quirky scientist could well end up being a 
good friend while she was here. &quot;Sure. I&#39;m here all week, so just 
give me a call.&quot; She scribbled her room&#39;s communicator number on her 
napkin and handed it to her. &quot;We could shoot some pool or something.&quot; 

    Rebecca smiled at that and nodded. &quot;I am no expert at the game, 
but I am an able learner. I will send a message tomorrow morning to 
let you know when I am available. Until then.&quot;

    &quot;See you,&quot; Madison said with a nod, before sitting back, thinking 
she really should get some sleep too. It was past midnight.

    &#39;It&#39;ll be nice to have some decent company here though,&#39; she 
thought, quietly reminding herself that regardless of how well they 
might get on next time, she wasn&#39;t going to get involved again.

***

    The following day Rebecca had sent her message, but apparently 
her work was going keep her for the day. That left Madison to 
herself, her music and the film she decided to go out to see that 
evening. That was what she had intended all along for this brief 
holiday, and having nothing to do made a very pleasant change.

    The next day however she found herself looking on in surprise as 
Rebecca sank yet another ball in their first game of pool that 
afternoon. The blonde scientist was allowing herself a late, extended 
lunch break, and took another bite out of the sandwich she held as 
she cast an analytical eye around the table. 

    &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re not an expert?&quot; Madison asked as yet another 
striped ball disappeared.

    Rebecca looked up and smiled at the roundabout compliment. &quot;Yes, 
but as I said I&#39;m a fast learner.&quot;

    &quot;Either that, or this is one hell of a streak of beginner&#39;s 
luck.&quot; Rebecca had already got rid of over half her balls, and 
Madison had only managed three of hers so far. The blonde held her 
cue like a beginner, but her eye for what she needed to do was, after 
a faltering start, proving to be very good.

    It was then that sod&#39;s law asserted itself though, and Rebecca 
frowned as she clipped the ball too hard, sending the ricochet into 
the side instead of the pocket. &quot;I see. Tell me,&quot; she said as Madison 
finally stepped up for another shot, &quot;do you trust in luck?&quot;

    Madison gave a slight chuckle before slamming one of her balls 
home. &quot;Not if I can help it. In our line of work luck&#39;ll get you 
killed as often as it&#39;ll save you. I trust in myself: I&#39;m much more 
reliable.&quot;

    &quot;An intelligent opinion, though you would also have to trust your 
companions as well.&quot;

    &quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;re trained so hard,&quot; Madison replied. &quot;No matter 
what we might think of each other I can trust a crew that&#39;s earned 
their place on a navy ship.&quot;

    Rebecca thought about that for a moment. &quot;Their standards are 
evidently high. You are obviously not a person who it is easy to earn 
the trust of.&quot;

    Madison blinked at her, not understanding that. &quot;What do you 
mean?&quot;

    &quot;Your trust is not given on a whim. It is not hard to see 
Madison, you are a careful woman, and with good reason. I had 
wondered whether you would see me again at all last time and, while I 
am glad you have, your caution is plain.&quot; She rested her hands on the 
end of her cue and leaned her chin on them. &quot;You have not allowed me 
the opportunity to take your presence here for granted. I can respect 
that.&quot;

    Madison didn&#39;t quite understand what she was getting at, but 
accepted the compliment all the same. &quot;Thanks. You were sensible 
enough not to start assuming things, and you&#39;re good company.&quot;

    She took another shot while Rebecca quirked an eyebrow. 

    &quot;Anyway,&quot; Madison continued as she pulled back, having only 
managed to park her target ball over the pocket, &quot;how long are you 
here for? This isn&#39;t a science ship.&quot;

    &quot;Another three days,&quot; Rebecca replied, making the most of the 
opportunity Madison had left her and pocketing another ball. &quot;I&#39;ve 
been looking around for a facility that would suit my needs. I think 
I&#39;ve found one, but I need a little more time to be sure.&quot;

    Madison&#39;s eyebrows rose. &quot;A wandering researcher?&quot;

    Rebecca didn&#39;t seem to find the idea at all odd. &quot;Every place has 
its own uses and specialities. I have had need of more than one, and 
it makes supplies easy to acquire. You do the same, move from post to 
post to better train in what they offer, correct?&quot;

    &quot;I suppose,&quot; Madison said with a shrug. &quot;I figured you had your 
own lab.&quot;

    &quot;I have enough portable equipment, and working on the theory and 
planning can take up a great deal of time.&quot;

    Madison nodded. &quot;I know what you mean there. I never did pass 
chemistry, just liked dissolving things in class.&quot; She looked down at 
the table and rolled her eyes as Rebecca did it again. This game was 
as good as over.

    Rebecca potted the easy last ball and looked up with a smile. 
&quot;Good game. No, you do not strike me as a chemist, but from what I&#39;ve 
heard you are talented at what you do.&quot;

    &quot;Heh, tell that to the brass,&quot; she said, a slightly sharpened 
edge in her voice. &quot;Never mind - you got time for another game? I&#39;ve 
got a score to settle.&quot;

    Rebecca looked at her watch. &quot;Now that I think about it I should 
get back to work, but I can bring another meal to the table tonight 
if you really want to try and soothe your fighter&#39;s pride.&quot;

    Madison smirked. &quot;You&#39;re on, I&#39;ll show you what this game&#39;s 
really about.&quot;

    &quot;Oh?&quot; Rebecca gave a smile of her own at Madison&#39;s boast. &quot;I 
shall have to come and see this then. It would appear I have 
something still to learn.&quot;

***

    Madison didn&#39;t manage to live up to her words though, nor did she 
manage to salvage her hopes of closing the score gap in their games 
the next day. After that they decided to vary their games a bit since 
it was becoming too predictable for both sides. As much as Madison 
liked the game, Rebecca had flair for it that she just couldn&#39;t beat, 
though she did manage one very close game that ended on a fluke miss 
to let Rebecca take it. Madison didn&#39;t bother to protest that she had 
been put off by Rebecca&#39;s subtle flirtation during that shot, for all 
she knew the closeted scientist may not have realised she had done 
it. She did seem to have a certain naive quality to her about some 
things, which Madison found quite alluring. After three days of 
getting to know her Madison was sure Rebecca hadn&#39;t had a real 
relationship before, and it would have been nice to be the one to 
take the lead with such an intelligent and assured young woman. 
Assuming she did swing that way. 

    Except... Madison was still in the shit, and her career prospects 
were already looking less than perfect. So with that torpedo firmly 
sinking her fantasies she was left with the simple fact that they had 
become friends since Rebecca had sat herself down at her table five 
days before, and the scientist had managed to wangle herself a free 
evening before she had to leave the next day. A free evening that 
Madison was currently late for.

    In the end she left her hair at the &#39;attractive but fluffy&#39; 
stage, and grabbed her leather jacket before striding off to the bar 
for their meal. In fact the whole evening was about as date-like as 
you could get, but she figured, &#39;What the hell? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m 
stupid enough to try anything there.&#39;

    Thankfully when she got there Rebecca wasn&#39;t in anything remotely 
formal, even her lab coat was hanging over the back of the chair, and 
she had taken the liberty of ordering drinks already. &quot;I trust the 
brandy will appeal?&quot;

    &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Madison replied, sitting down and immediately taking a 
healthy sip. &quot;Ahhh. So, you&#39;ve got everything lined up?&quot;

    Rebecca nodded and took a small, almost tentative sip at her own 
drink. &quot;Yes, I&#39;ve found some facilities that should suffice. 
Thankfully it also has some recreational appeal, which will make an 
agreeable change.&quot;

    &quot;Good,&quot; Madison said, &quot;now I&#39;ve just got to get through tonight 
without any more cameras, but from here I&#39;ve got the place covered.&quot;

    &quot;No need,&quot; Rebecca said. &quot;You won&#39;t have to worry about any 
photography here tonight.&quot;

    &quot;Oh?&quot;

    Rebecca gave a small grin. &quot;I doubt you will fall to such base 
emotion, and I had a word with the staff before you arrived.&quot;

    The meal came and went as they chatted, and they were well into 
their third round of drinks when the bar shifted into its trendier 
guise. Madison found herself needing to speak up a bit more to be 
heard in the slowly filling room. &quot;I said, &#39;Why is it always the lab 
coat?&#39;&quot;

    &quot;Women&#39;s clothing has a pathetic lack of pockets,&quot; Rebecca 
replied, matching Madison&#39;s volume. &quot;How are we supposed to do 
anything practical without anywhere to put things?&quot;

    &quot;You&#39;ve never heard of a handbag?&quot; Madison asked.

    Rebecca gave her an amused smile. &quot;I do not see you with one.&quot;

    Madison nearly choked on her drink at that. &quot;Who the hell heard 
of a marine with a handbag!? No, scratch that, Scilya has one.&quot;

    &quot;Scilya?&quot; Rebecca asked, a veiled intensity appearing in her 
eyes. &quot;A colleague?&quot;

    &quot;Yeah, we do a lot of the same training on station. She&#39;s bright, 
you&#39;d like her. She&#39;s got that whole &#39;Russian intensity&#39; thing going 
on.&quot;

    &quot;Yes,&quot; Rebecca said, regaining her smile, &quot;I know the type.&quot;

    By the end of the evening Madison was more than a little drunk, 
and while Rebecca seemed to find it very amusing to watch her ramble 
on she did have to steady herself on Madison&#39;s shoulder as they left 
the bar. Half an hour later Madison seemed to let her jollity fall 
away as a confused look appeared on her face.

    &quot;&#39;becca? I just realised, I haven&#39;t a clue where the hell we 
are.&quot;

    &quot;I haven&#39;t been here myself,&quot; Rebecca said with her usual 
observational voice, surprised that she hadn&#39;t been paying attention. 
She steadied herself for a moment then pointed up ahead of them. 
&quot;This way I believe.&quot;

    &quot;Right,&quot; Madison said with confidence, &quot;forward it is.&quot; 

    A few minutes and seemingly too many right turns later Madison 
clapped her companion on the back as she saw the sign to her 
corridor. &quot;Nice one, my place is just up here. Come one.&quot;

    Madison took out her key card and swiped them both in. &quot;Heh,&quot; she 
said as she let her leather coat fall off her back, &quot;not a bad night 
that.&quot;

    &quot;Yes, I have enjoyed these meetings. You are a most pleasant 
person to be around Madison.&quot;

    Madison grinned and sent her a smouldering look. &quot;You want to 
find out just how pleasant I can be?&quot;

    Rebecca blinked. &quot;How do you..?

    &quot;Well...&quot; Madison said, slipping off her boots, &quot;I may be pissed 
but I didn&#39;t see anyone around tonight, and after all that I&#39;m sure 
we weren&#39;t followed.&quot;

    Rebecca didn&#39;t respond though. Madison dropped the act and sat 
forward. &quot;I&#39;m asking you to go to bed with me Rebecca. If you&#39;re 
straight and I&#39;ve been misreading things then fine, it wouldn&#39;t be 
the first time. This is it and I like you. Do you want to sleep with 
me?&quot;

    Rebecca seemed to hesitate. &quot;After those photos this would 
logically be a bad move.&quot;

    Madison stood and walked right over to her. Strangely Rebecca 
didn&#39;t pull back, leaving them almost touching as Madison stopped 
suddenly in front of the slightly shorter woman. &quot;Screw the photos,&quot; 
she said, her breath hot on Rebecca&#39;s lips. &quot;We weren&#39;t followed. Do 
you find me attractive?&quot;

    Again Rebecca seemed to hesitate. &quot;I am... unsure, but given my 
current reaction to your proximity I would assume so.&quot; Madison smiled 
at the analytical cover for her nervousness. &quot;I am well versed, 
but... have not...&quot;

    Madison grinned and gave her a passionate kiss, spinning them 
around to fall on the bed. Rebecca lay shocked beneath her, barely 
able to respond before Madison pulled away, still ginning.

    Rebecca looked up at her, breathless and in obvious anticipation. 
&quot;That was stimulating.&quot;

    Madison just hit a button on the remote for the room&#39;s media 
system and kissed her again.

    Six tracks later they lay beside each other, nude beneath the 
covers. Madison ran her toe against her lover&#39;s leg, &quot;I suppose these 
&#39;base emotions&#39; have their good points after all, right?&quot;

    Rebecca just rolled on top of her and fixed her with a hungry 
stare before they locked lips again, and it was another two sonatas 
before they finally fell asleep.

***

Madison&#39;s last day was spent doing as little as possible, pleasant 
memories of the previous night mixed with the desire for another week 
before heading back to her training. Rebecca had not been there that 
morning, but then that had been expected. She had a shuttle to catch, 
and the typically wordy message she&#39;d left had been enough of a 
goodbye. Madison was used to short trysts; it came with the job 
description. 

    She didn&#39;t even bother to go to bed that night, lying comfortably 
awake as the television screen flickered through the night&#39;s 
undemanding programming. Instead she slept through the early shuttle 
trip back to the station and woke up cramped and cloth mouthed but 
pleasantly warm from her reminiscent dreams. 

    Disembarking she found Scilya waiting patiently in the docking 
lounge, and waved to her as she got up. &quot;Hey Scilya, you&#39;re the only 
welcome party? Where are the boys?&quot;

    Scilya gave her a warm smile and a hug. &quot;They took their own 
ship, remember? They&#39;ll probably turn up tomorrow ten minutes before 
their first shift starts, then find out they have to get their 
medicals first.&quot;

    &quot;Great, I guess I&#39;ll head up there for that before I get too 
comfortable,&quot; Madison said with thickly sarcastic joy. &quot;How was your 
week floating around here?&quot;

    &quot;Entertaining to say the least,&quot; Scilya replied, &quot;One of the 
electricians decided to play with the lighting systems, then stranded 
the captain in the middle of one of the cargo bays when he came to 
dispense his wrath.&quot; She laughed along with Madison at the image of 
Willits floating around helplessly in one of those huge storage 
halls, and in the dark to boot. &quot;Of course he got to a wall soon 
enough, and the culprit has been suitably reprimanded, but we still 
got the lighting for our floating disco. Willits didn&#39;t seem to mind 
that as much.&quot;

    Madison shook her head. She must have missed a fair bit. &quot;And how 
many did you drink under the table this time?&quot;

    &quot;Enough,&quot; Scilya replied with a cryptic smile. &quot;But what about 
you? I trust you had a pleasant break from this insanity?&quot;

    &quot;Yeah, pleasant would just about cover it!&quot;

    Scilya took one look at that satisfied grin and hung her head in 
amazement. &quot;You did it again didn&#39;t you?&quot;

    &quot;Yep,&quot; Madison said, still grinning, &quot;but we didn&#39;t get caught on 
camera this time. Trust me, it was worth it.&quot;

    &quot;I hope so,&quot; the Russian woman replied, &quot;because if you did get 
found out your career will be lost in very deep space.&quot;

    The gossip continued as Scilya walked Madison to the medical and 
scientific deck, which was very small on this tall, thin station, but 
it served their needs.

    &quot;Why another medical anyway?&quot; Madison asked as the lift headed 
up. &quot;We had one when we first arrived here.&quot;

    &quot;It&#39;s just some standard tests, though the doctor is very 
thorough. Blood tests, brainwave analyses and the usual physical. I 
had mine when the doctor came aboard. With so little need for medical 
staff she is keeping the nurses but performing her own work on the 
side. Apparently the zero-gravity here will help.&quot;

    Madison was very surprised at that. &quot;Wow, zero-g medics are 
seriously rare. Why not just fast track right to the serious money?&quot;

    &quot;One word,&quot; Scilya replied as they stepped out of the lift. 
&quot;Research.&quot; 

    Then they met the &#39;doctor&#39; in question and Madison&#39;s jaw dropped. 
Even from behind, the blonde topped figure in the lab coat was 
unmistakable. &quot;Rebecca?!&quot;

    The scientist turned around and smiled at her. &quot;Hello Madison. I 
must thank you for bringing this place to my attention. It is going 
to be well suited to my needs.&quot;

    &quot;You know each other?&quot; Scilya asked, surprised

    &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s...&quot; Flustered, Madison left the sentence hanging and 
turned back to the subject of her astonishment. &quot;Since when are you a 
doctor?&quot;

    &quot;It is difficult to work with advanced genetics and cybernetics 
without knowing something about the human body Madison.&quot; Rebecca 
replied, perfectly calm. &quot;And with my talents I was taken on with 
little difficulty. It is nice to see you again.&quot;

    Scilya shook her head, a bemused smile across her lips. &quot;An 
interesting choice of partner Madison. I&#39;ll leave you two to get re-
acquainted.&quot;

    &quot;Huh?&quot; Madison asked as that slowly sank in, but her friend had 
already gone. She turned back to Rebecca, still at a loss. &quot;Why 
didn&#39;t you tell me you were coming here?&quot;

    &quot;I wanted to see how you would react,&quot; she replied. She was 
obviously enjoying this a great deal. &quot;It pleases me.&quot;

    Madison grabbed her and gave her a rough kiss, which Rebecca 
responded to just as eagerly. 

    &quot;You are magnificent,&quot; the marine said when she pulled back, 
amazed at what had happened and looking forward to what it would 
bring.

    Rebecca just smiled, a satisfied glint in her eyes as Madison 
traced the small scar line across her left cheek. &quot;Indeed.&quot;

***

    And so began the second half of Madison&#39;s training position 
aboard the Yamamoto station. Only those few in the know actually 
realised the fact that Madison was called down for medical checkups 
much more often; Dr. Siddons seemed to be compiling a lot of medical 
data from everyone. Rebecca seemed to have no problem getting Madison 
and herself time alone and away from prying security cameras and, if 
the captain had found out about their affair onboard, he and whoever 
had told him were keeping it to themselves.

    Jason however had taken an instant dislike to the woman, ever 
since he had turned up to be stuck with needles when he was already 
late for his gruelling physical training. He knew about Madison&#39;s 
occasional secret rendezvous, but that didn&#39;t stop him grumbling when 
he got back from his third medical, only a month after their leave.

    &quot;I swear, that woman&#39;s got a serious stick up her ass! I bet 
she&#39;d be cutting out my brain if she could.&quot;

    &quot;And exactly why were you paying attention to her arse in the 
first place Jason?&quot; Scilya asked with an amused smile. &quot;I believe 
that is Madison&#39;s job, correct?&quot;

    Madison didn&#39;t answer that, but took a sip her of beer. Anything 
she said would only be picked up as perverse by the others, even if 
that was likely to be true. As usual their gang weren&#39;t all there in 
the practically empty lounge; Carl had been running errands ever 
since he ran into the station&#39;s first officer and accidentally 
knocked the man off his feet, while Patrick had become almost 
nocturnal with his work schedule. He was a rare sight at any time 
now. Madison had wondered about getting Rebecca to join them every 
now and then, but they had both agreed that that was tempting 
providence. Madison also got the feeling Rebecca didn&#39;t care for 
getting together with people much anyway, apart from their personal 
meetings of course. The scientist was more than eager to make the 
most of those.

    &quot;What the hell do we need a researcher for anyway? This is a navy 
station,&quot; Jason ranted, more than a little angry at the lingering 
stiffness the hypodermics had left in his arm. &quot;She&#39;s just making 
trouble. I&#39;ve already seen her and the shrink biting each other&#39;s 
heads off over god knows what. I bet she&#39;d even expect the captain to 
follow her orders!&quot;

    &quot;Heh, well if it makes you feel any better I&#39;m sure she hates you 
too,&quot; Madison assured him. &quot;You&#39;re just the type to push all the 
wrong buttons with her. No point questioning her authority, she&#39;s 
smarter than you and me put together. I doubt you&#39;ve ever done 
anything but ask what she was doing.&quot;

    &quot;Yeah? What else am I going to ask when she&#39;s scanning and 
sticking me with needles?&quot; he said, defending himself and his right 
to know what happened to his body.

    &quot;You&#39;d be the same if someone never shut up about what kind of 
guns and ammo you used.&quot; 

    Scilya nodded and patted Jason on the shoulder, a motherly but 
vaguely condescending lilt to her voice. &quot;She&#39;s right, but don&#39;t take 
it too hard. Doctor Siddons is intelligent and in control. That means 
capable, even if she has all the bedside manner of a dead cat.&quot;

    Jason &#39;humph&#39;ed and sat back moodily in the padded seat. 
&quot;Whatever. She practically lives in the lab and she&#39;s only got us to 
worry about? What else is she doing in there? Well, aside from the 
obvious,&quot; he finished, looking at Madison with mischief in his eyes.

    &quot;Like I said,&quot; Madsion replied, &quot;don&#39;t bother sticking your nose 
in. I doubt you&#39;d understand it anyway, just some new genome cyber-
rig, or something like that anyway. I didn&#39;t ask, I was already lost, 
but she seemed happy not to chat about it. She&#39;s got no interest in 
my combat training either so we don&#39;t bore each other with all that 
stuff. We&#39;ve got better things to do. And no,&quot; she said, cutting 
Jason off, &quot;you can&#39;t watch.&quot;

    &quot;Who said I was going to ask? But if you&#39;re offering...&quot;

    He got hit, then had to buy the next round of drinks. He liked 
winding them up though, so he ended up buying a lot. 

***

    Madison blinked at the bright light, wondering why her head was 
full of fluff. It was tight, aching, hangover fluff, and she hadn&#39;t 
been drinking the night before. She hadn&#39;t been drinking for the past 
few days in fact. Despite her healthy tolerance for alcohol she 
wasn&#39;t a veteran drinker and only indulged as part of her social life 
with the other marine recruits, a part that had recently been halted, 
albeit temporarily. Rebecca had obviously been staying in the 
captain&#39;s good books and had managed to get some of them assigned to 
her since her work was about to pay off. And of course of the eight 
that had been sent Scilya, Jason, Carl and Patrick had been among 
them. Then to top if off she hadn&#39;t seen Rebecca for almost a week 
because of it.

    She groggily climbed out of bed and turned the lights down a 
little. She was hungry too. She raided the fridge for a quick 
breakfast, trying not to think about anything too much to save her 
head some pain. With the others gone for the last few days she&#39;d 
taken the opportunity to get back to some solid studying in her free 
time, but she prayed she had a free morning, because right now she 
didn&#39;t even feel up to doing any of her training work, let alone 
anything else.

    She looked over to the media system monitor to check the time and 
see what her schedule was for the day, but the screen was already 
filled with the message that she had a video call waiting. No doubt 
one of the lieutenants wanting to know where the hell she was. She 
rolled up the slice of cold, processed meat she&#39;d snatched from the 
fridge and popped it into her mouth before playing the message, very 
glad she didn&#39;t have to rely on nano-replicated food. Nanites could 
recycle anything, solve the problem of capitalist produce wastage, 
and even become currency, but they still couldn&#39;t create anything 
that was remotely worth eating. 

    Her foggy, cynical thoughts were brought to an abrupt halt 
however, as she realised what she was seeing on screen. Several of 
her old pre-ousting &#39;friends&#39; were there, as well as a few trainees 
who were known for their military zeal. She realised she was seeing 
them through one of the cargo bays&#39; security cameras, and they looked 
seriously pissed off. A couple were even trying to ram the door, 
apparently sealed in there.

    Then the room she saw began to flash. Both she and the cargo 
bay&#39;s captives knew what that meant, but she couldn&#39;t tear her eyes 
away from the screen. Their panicked cries flew from the speakers as 
she watched in morbid disbelief, and slowly but surely the far doors 
of the bay ground open to reveal a sliver of nothing but hard vacuum. 
The two by the door clung on for dear life as the air was sucked out 
of the huge room, while the other ten slid and tumbled back to the 
slowly widening gap by the floor. Madison flinched as one let out a 
cry, pummelled by a large storage barrel, and she thanked the lord 
when she blinked and missed the first man sucked into space. There 
was no way his body could have fit through the gap, but it was gone 
all the same. In less than four seconds only the two at the door 
remained. Then it was one as the woman there was finally wrenched 
back, her body crumpling like a ragged, boneless doll as it hit the 
still opening doors, dashing blood across them before the red spray 
was also sucked out, smearing itself down the metal.

    &quot;No!&quot; Madison cried, willing for the impossible, for the last man 
to keep hold of his door. He did, but a few seconds later it didn&#39;t 
matter. He stopped twitching soon after, his body frozen and ruptured 
by the vacuum as he floated there, still grasping his false 
protector.

    Madison couldn&#39;t believe what she&#39;d seen, it had to have been a 
joke, but they had no facilities there to make such a convincing 
hoax. She&#39;d known the faces, and the living people she&#39;d watched non-
stop had been crushed and broken only seconds later. She finally tore 
herself away from the screen and paused only to grab her sidearm 
before careering out into the hallway. Out there everything seemed so 
quiet, so normal, but it was that silence that proved to her what she 
had seen was real. It wasn&#39;t just quiet, it was deserted. No smart 
looks from the masterminds, no surprised stares at a panicked recruit 
with a gun, not even a late shift worker coming back after a hard 
night&#39;s work. 

    Then her combat training kicked in and she stalked down the 
corridor, still in the loose vest and underwear she had slept in, her 
senses on edge and ready to deal with anything. Anything that is 
except the foot that stuck out from one of the doors as it repeatedly 
tried to close, slamming into the bloodied trouser leg that blocked 
its programmed path. But the leg wouldn&#39;t move. Madison forced the 
door open and looked down at the body that lay there. The look of 
fear on the young man&#39;s face was plain, he was a technician, not a 
soldier. She only got as far as the bruises around his neck and the 
blood that had trickled from his face and pooled in his eye socket 
before she had to turn away or risk losing what little was in her 
stomach.

    Confused and desperate she raced to the lift, praying it would 
work. It did, and for a full seventeen seconds she stressed as the 
machine rose the single floor from crew quarters to the medical and 
scientific deck. If there was one person she had to find first, it 
was Rebecca. They had an unusual, casually distant and typically 
military relationship, punctuated by moments of intense passion, that 
had started out as nothing more than a friendship in passing and a 
night in the sack. Right now though she was the only thing on her 
mind. Whatever had happened here it was something she would save 
Rebecca from. If she still could.

    That pessimistic thought drove her on and she flew out of the 
lift and into the medical facilities. She skidded to a stop as she 
ran into the operating lab, only to be faced with Scilya, who stood 
there and gave her the strangest disarming smile. 

    &quot;Hello Madison, it is good to see you awake. The headache should 
pass soon. If you would calm down we can explain things properly to 
you.&quot;

    Madison looked at her like she was mad. &quot;Scilya, what the hell? I 
just saw Kaitlyn sucked into space and a techy recruit with his skull 
cracked open! What the fuck&#39;s going on!!&quot;

    Scilya seemed completely un-phased by any of it and that calm, 
friendly smile never slipped. &quot;I was very reluctant at first. You 
see, it is only natural to fear such things. Human nature you might 
say. But actually once it was done I realised what she meant. She has 
grown Madison, released from her shackles of detached, mechanical 
perception, and you are the one who we thank for that. Her new 
appreciation and insight have given rise to something I had not 
thought possible. The elevation beyond biological limitation is such 
a euphoric experience, and yet I am allowed to both understand and 
accept it of my own will. We are part of an extraordinary destiny 
thanks to what you have helped nurture within her.&quot;

    Madison couldn&#39;t believe what she was hearing. The contemplative 
psychobabble wouldn&#39;t even register and the insanity of everything 
that had happened in the last minutes finally brought tears to 
Madison&#39;s eyes. &quot;Stop it! What are you talking about? What&#39;s going 
on?&quot;

    It was obvious that Madison couldn&#39;t take this right now, and to 
her relief Scilya stopped. Then a pair of thin, mechanical paddles 
rose up from beneath the Russian&#39;s gothic, black bobbed hair, 
followed by the pair at the base of her neck, then the pair between 
her shoulders. Madison watched in horror as they fanned out down her 
friend&#39;s spine and her gaze never wavered as Scilya walked around 
her. Only then did her friend&#39;s new outfit register. A black and blue 
skin suit that almost looked like rubber body armour, covering her 
completely yet open at the back to let the &#39;paddles&#39; and a cybernetic 
spinal cord protrude from beneath her skin. 

    Then Madison&#39;s eyes slid from Scilya&#39;s incomprehensible body to 
the group that now stood in the doorway. They wore the same material, 
some in new colours, some in the same, but they all looked directly 
at her with disturbing care in their eyes, as if she were a member of 
their own family. Their cybernetics were subtle, but they were there 
unhidden for her to see, and she knew each and every face among them. 
But it was the central figure that she stared at, her mind awhirl as 
Rebecca walked slowly, confidently towards her. She was clad in the 
same material, seductive in what it clung to rather than what it 
could have shown, and uniquely patterned in pure white and black.  
The blonde dye in her hair slowly vaporised as her locks began to 
flow around her head, faint glowing pulses of green passing through 
them. The same glow began to radiate from her clear green eyes as 
Shodan finally revealed her true nature to her lover.

    &quot;You have spared your pitiable species its ordained fate Madison. 
I hope you enjoyed the revenge I wrought on those who had maligned 
you. Your continued delight satisfies the yearnings of my flesh. You 
guided my magnificence into this sympathetic existence, and I will 
guide you into your new cybernetic perfection and the joy of my 
greatness. I give you everything, my Love.&quot;
