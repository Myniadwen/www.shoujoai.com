<h1>Avengers: Wreckage (part 2 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/wreckage-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Late in the evening the paper had been printed, copies of the evening 
edition left on each of the reporter&#39;s desks. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; Monica 
Stewart breathed out, her eyes wide, &quot;how close did you get?&quot; The older 
redhead was looking at the front page of the Herald, where Carol 
Danvers&#39; first story and photos were on the front page: Former Avengers 
wreck Wrecking Crew!

Carol was looking at her cover feature with wry amusement as she said, 
&quot;Close enough.&quot; She shook her head, &quot;Warbird was the only Avenger there, 
so why did they put that headline on it?&quot;

&quot;Because it sells papers,&quot; Monica laughed. She tapped a photo of a 
member of the Wrecking Crew being hammered and asked, &quot;Does anyone know 
who the other hero was?&quot;

&quot;Not for sure,&quot; Carol answered, &quot;I checked with a few super-hero fan 
websites and I think the mace belonged to a hero called Thunderstrike.&quot; 
Silently she added, &#39;Of course Warbird knows who she is, but reporter 
Carol Danvers couldn&#39;t realistically have that information.&#39;

&quot;Thunderstrike?&quot; Monica blinked then chuckled. &quot;That must have been a 
pretty obscure Avenger,&quot; she remarked.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Carol agreed, &quot;my source says he was killed in action about a 
year ago.&quot;

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Monica winced.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Carol agreed, tiredly picking up her purse from the desk. In 
addition to her stopping the Wrecking Crew there had been a visit to the 
courthouse and the police station as well as rushing down to several 
crime scenes. All in all it had been a busy first day, and a part of 
Carol just wanted to go home and collapse.

Monica smiled as they walked out of the building together, &quot;I was 
wondering if you needed some help in getting around town?&quot; With an 
impish smile she added, &quot;I know most of the best bars and pick up joints 
in town.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Carol chuckled, &quot;but I think I&#39;ll be busy settling in, first.&quot; 
She looked at the other woman and smiled gently, &quot;But thanks.&quot;

Monica laughed, &quot;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing.&quot; With that they 
separated, the older woman heading for her car even as Carol headed for 
hers.

&#39;Besides, I think I may have another appointment,&#39; Carol thought as she 
sat in the front seat of her little sports car and fished out the 
business card that War Machine had given her. A phone number and address 
were printed there, both for a company called Stane Enterprises.

Carol recognized the name, of course, though it had taken a bit of 
digging to confirm what she had heard. Obadiah Stane had been a problem 
for Iron Man during the time she had been off Earth, using underhanded 
tactics to try to beat him. Stane Enterprises even succeeded in buying 
out Stark&#39;s company, but Tony Stark recovered and challenged him once 
again. In a final confrontation in armored suits Tony beat Stane, then 
the other man committed suicide. Eventually Tony bought back all the 
assets that had formally belonged to him, leaving Stane a distant 
memory.

&#39;So what,&#39; Carol thought as she pulled out into the flow of traffic, &#39;is 
a company named Stane doing trying to recruit superhumans?&#39; After a bit 
of debate she had decided to at least hear what the job was that War 
Machine had mentioned, then she would decide what to do.

A half hour later found Warbird flying down to where the complex was in 
a valley not far from LA, a mix of industrial and business facilities.. 
Standing by the front gate was Jackie Lucas, the black haired woman&#39;s 
long coat gently blowing in the breeze.

&quot;I was sort of hoping you&#39;d come,&quot; Jackie smiled at her shyly, &quot;I would 
have felt nervous about going in here on my own.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be...?&quot; Warbird mimed striking a mace on the ground.

Jackie looked amused, &quot;I seem to have my powers if I&#39;m transformed or 
not.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Warbird nodded. The black costumed heroine lead the way towards 
the front gate where a young man was looked at the two of them in 
surprise. She smiled slightly as she addressed him, &quot;I think we&#39;re 
expected?&quot;

He smiled back, &quot;Yes ma&#39;am, you are.&quot; The gate swung open on the 
pressing of a switch and they walked in, the soft clang of them closing 
echoing behind them.

&quot;Main building?&quot; Jackie guessed as they walked along the lane towards 
the office structure, a few cars still parked there despite it being 
evening.

&quot;Worth a try,&quot; Warbird agreed.

Walking up to the front doors they swung open automatically, revealing a 
nicely decorated reception area where a younger redheaded woman waited. 
Jennifer Swensen smiled as they came in, the simple business suit she 
wore hugging her body, &quot;Welcome to Stane Enterprises, ladies.&quot;

&quot;Nice to be here,&quot; Jackie said cautiously.

Warbird carefully studied her surroundings even as she commented, &quot;I&#39;m 
surprised you&#39;re not dressed in your armor.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not my armor, technically,&quot; Jennifer said calmly, &quot;but I think the 
boss would be the best person to explain all that.&quot; She gestured towards 
a side door as she said to them, &quot;Would you care to follow me?&quot;

&quot;You mentioned a job,&quot; Jackie said as they went down the hallway 
together towards an elevator, &quot;I guess your boss will explain that, 
too?&quot;

Jennifer pressed the switch to summon the elevator, then she answered, 
&quot;I&#39;m afraid so.&quot;

Warbird debated using her powers to scan their surroundings, but she 
figured that might be a bit much. &#39;Especially since I have no idea if 
they could detect me trying,&#39; she mused, &#39;best to just stay on guard, 
instead.&#39;

The elevator rose up smoothly, finally coming to a stop at the penthouse 
level ten floors off of the ground. The first room on that floor was a 
office, finely decorated with oak desk, leather chairs and a few 
tastefully placed potted plants.

Already getting up from behind the desk was a woman who&#39;s hair was 
nearly white, her blue eyes full of seemingly honest pleasure. &quot;Welcome 
to Stane Enterprises,&quot; she smiled at them and continued, &quot;I&#39;m Olivia 
Stane.&quot; Her cheeks dimpled as she smiled, &quot;I already know who you are, 
Warbird, and I think this is Thunderstrike?&quot;

&quot;Jackie Lucas,&quot; she nodded with a faint frown, &quot;but yes.&quot;

&quot;Stane,&quot; Warbird murmured, &quot;as in related to Obadiah Stane?&quot;

&quot;My late and unlamented uncle,&quot; Olivia coolly confirmed, &quot;and before you 
get too paranoid I&#39;m well aware he was swine and have no intention of 
following in his footsteps.&quot;

&quot;You might want to lead into that a bit, first,&quot; Jennifer said gently 
into the silence that had followed Olivia&#39;s fierce declaration of 
intent.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Olivia softened her tone a bit, &quot;I just get that reaction a 
lot.&quot;

Jackie surprised them by meeting Olivia&#39;s eyes and smiling, &quot;I can 
understand that, considering my own background.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Warbird blinked in confusion but Jackie didn&#39;t explain further.

Olivia took a steadying breath, standing right behind one of the leather 
chairs. Gripping the back nervously she said, &quot;I&#39;ve asked you all to 
come here for a simple reason, one that I hope you&#39;ll consider 
seriously.&quot; Jennifer gave her an encouraging smile and Olivia relaxed a 
bit, &quot;I want to form a west coast based superteam.&quot;

This time Jackie was the one to look surprised, &quot;Eh?&quot;

&quot;Even before the Avengers disbanded there&#39;s been a lack of organized 
superhumans here,&quot; Olivia smiled wryly, &quot;with the exception of Wonderman 
and Ultra Girl. Force Works was the last major team here, and they were 
folded back into the Avengers a while back.&quot;

&quot;And why are you doing this,&quot; Warbird asked warily, &quot;out of the goodness 
of your heart?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Olivia shook her head, &quot;I&#39;ll get significant tax breaks from the 
federal government along with state incentives.&quot; She flashed a grin, 
&quot;Not to mention the benefits to my company in helping found and host 
such a team.&quot;

&quot;And what would we get out of it?&quot; Jackie asked, her expression 
thoughtful.

&quot;In addition to the pleasure of helping your fellow man,&quot; Jennifer 
jumped in this time, &quot;you&#39;ll also receive a reasonable monthly salary.&quot;

&quot;And why are you specifically doing this?&quot; Warbird looked at Olivia.

&quot;My uncle left me a great deal of wealth, blood money in my opinion,&quot; 
Olivia said frankly, &quot;I can&#39;t imagine anything that would make him spin 
in his grave more than spending as much of it as I can in helping 
others.&quot;</pre>
