<h1>New Frontier Gunfighter (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/gunfighter-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>An excerpt from the Encyclopedia Galactica, 2345
Edition, continued:

.... while gunfighters themselves were a very
different breed. Much like the criminals they chose to
hunt they were outcasts, people who&#39;s natures put them
in conflict with mainstream society. Coming from all
walks of life they brought a variety of skills to the
job, but all had one thing in common: they were
ruthless and efficient killers when needed.

The sun shone through the windows of the little room
in the dancehall, the air dry and stale. Both stood
frozen, as still as the afternoon air, until finally
the smallest of smiles appeared on that face. &quot;The
door?&quot; Jan repeated, the black haired, boyish young
woman calmly standing there without her shirt on, her
small breasts firmly tied down by a bandage.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Bonnie turned around to close it, the redhead
visibly rattled by her discovery that her guest wasn&#39;t
quite what he seemed.

&quot;I should have locked the door,&quot; Jan shrugged. She
gave Bonnie a thoughtful look, &quot;I hope I can rely on
your discretion?&quot;

Bonnie thought of all the married men in town who
relied on her discretion and smiled wryly. &quot;Of
course,&quot; she said, &quot;I just wanted to ask if you wanted
a bath?&quot;

&quot;I had one on the ship earlier,&quot; Jan answered before
asking, &quot;would the offer still be open in a few days?&quot;

&quot;That depends,&quot; Bonnie flashed a smile as she moved to
open the door and step out into the hall, &quot;on how good
a guest you are.&quot;

Jan laughed softly, &quot;I&#39;ll try to be a good one then.&quot;

Later that day, the bar down the street was quiet as
Bonnie entered, Larry looking up with a welcoming
smile when he saw her. &quot;I hear you have a new guest up
there,&quot; he smiled, the white tinged black hair falling
into his eyes.

Bonnie rolled her eyes, &quot;It didn&#39;t take long for the
word to spread, did it?&quot;

&quot;In this town?&quot; Larry chuckled. He finished cleaning
off the bar even as he poured out her favorite drink,
simulated brandy on the rocks.

&quot;Yes, the gunfighter is staying at the Place,&quot; Bonnie
confirmed while she put the coins on the bar, &quot;to be
honest I could use the extra money.&quot;

&quot;I thought you were doing pretty well,&quot; Larry raised
an eyebrow.

&quot;Can&#39;t stay in the business forever,&quot; Bonnie replied
frankly, &quot;and I&#39;d better have a fair bit of seed money
for whatever I may do next.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Larry admitted. He studied her for a moment
then asked, &quot;Aren&#39;t you worried about trouble if he
stays there?&quot;

&quot;To be honest, no,&quot; Bonnie took a drink, the ice cubes
clinking against the glass. She saw his surprised
look, &quot;Think about it, who in their right mind would
want to cause trouble at the Place knowing there&#39;s a
gunfighter there?&quot;

Larry shook his head with a grin, &quot;The place probably
is safer than it&#39;s been in months.&quot; A impish look,
&quot;I&#39;d think you&#39;d be worried about having a handsome
young man like that running around there around the
ladies.&quot;

&quot;Actually. he had his dinner with all of us earlier
tonight,&quot; Bonnie confided, &quot;and he was a perfect
gentleman.&quot;

&quot;Gay?&quot; Larry asked predictably.

&quot;Didn&#39;t ask,&quot; Bonnie said crisply, &quot;and I&#39;m not sure
if I want to know.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Larry nodded. &quot;Do you think you&#39;ll get
a lot of business once the cattle drives start coming
in?&quot;

Bonnie nodded, her lips pressed into a thin line. Many
of the homesteaders were married but that wouldn&#39;t
stop the men coming into town from dancing with the
girls and maybe going upstairs with them. It was a
common thing, and she really didn&#39;t have any right to
feel annoyed, it was what kept her in business after
all.

&quot;I&#39;m just glad I can quickly produce the synth-ales
now,&quot; Larry agreed, &quot;it&#39;s going to get crazy once the
younger men hit town.&quot; He seemed to be searching for
words, &quot;Do you want anyone keeping an eye on you and
your girls, just in case?&quot;

&quot;After that rape last time,&quot; Bonnie&#39;s eyes flashed
with sudden anger, &quot;the Mayor and Sheriff have
promised to take a hard line.&quot;

&quot;Here&#39;s hoping that&#39;s enough,&quot; Larry said dubiously.
He brightened, &quot;Maybe you should ask the gunfighter to
help out?&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious,&quot; Bonnie looked at him in
surprise.

Larry gazed back at her curiously and asked, &quot;You said
that having him there helps, so why not go a little
farther?&quot;

&quot;And if his solution to a rape is to shoot someone?&quot;
Bonnie challenged.

&quot;I doubt many of the townies would blame him,&quot; was
Larry&#39;s calm answer. He looked thoughtful, &quot;The
ranchers might have some issues....&quot;

Bonnie smiled grimly, &quot;Oh, yes.&quot; She finished the last
of her drink them moved away, walking across the dusty
wooden floor, &quot;I&#39;d better get back, make sure that the
girls aren&#39;t getting into any more trouble than
usual.&quot;

&quot;Watch yourself,&quot; Larry warned softly.

&quot;Always,&quot; she answered as Bonnie went out into the
night.

The wooden sidewalk lead up the street, the packed
dirt road beyond quiet in the twilight of evening. The
various shops were in the process of closing up, Rei
giving her a dignified nod of the head as she passed
outside the general store. Bonnie&#39;s Place was up the
way, beyond the City Hall and Sheriff&#39;s office, and
she was mildly surprised to see a figure standing in
front of the building.

Jan leaned up against the railing where waiting horses
would be tethered, the tall, slim figure gazing out
into the darkness. The black haired woman drew on a
flavor stick, the end glowing red as the chemicals
burned to generate the tastes the user desired.
Dressed in long coat, jeans and the guns strapped to
her thighs, she looked for all the world like a
handsome young man.

&quot;Evening,&quot; Jan looked up, a new hat perched a bit
awkwardly on her head.

&quot;A lovely one, yes,&quot; Bonnie agreed as she settled in
beside her.

Jan finished off the stick, a hint of vanilla
lingering on her breath. &quot;You should be careful,&quot; she
said as she casually tossed the still burning end out
onto the dirt road, &quot;there&#39;s been reports of hexapuma
that wander into town lately.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been doing your research,&quot; Bonnie looked over
at Jan in surprise.

&quot;Always,&quot; was Jan&#39;s quiet answer. She smiled slightly,
&quot;Angel was getting a bit aggressive so I thought I&#39;d
get some fresh air.&quot;

Bonnie winced. &quot;I&#39;ll have a talk with her,&quot; she
promised. She looked over at Jan&#39;s boyish garb
curiously, &quot;Why do you...?&quot;

Jan&#39;s lip&#39;s turned up in a little smile, &quot;You know
just how hard it can be for a woman on her own.&quot; As
Bonnie nodded Jan continued on, &quot;And I have to admit
I&#39;m taken a bit more seriously if I&#39;m thought to be a
man.&quot;

&quot;Would I be pushing,&quot; Bonnie looked over at Jan
thoughtfully, &quot;if I asked how you got into this in the
first place?&quot; Jan didn&#39;t answer for awhile, and Bonnie
thought for a moment she had pushed the woman too far.

&quot;It&#39;s an old story,&quot; Jan&#39;s voice was quiet, &quot;my
parents were homesteaders, farmers out on some
backworld nobody even cared about. They owned their
land, planted and grew crops and raised two teenaged
girls out in the backside of nowhere.&quot;

The sound of hoofbeats stilled Jan a moment, the two
of them waiting till the rider went by in silence.
&quot;Problem was, someone decided the land would be better
used raising cattle,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;and began to
buy out the land all around us. They made Dad an
offer, a generous one, but he wasn&#39;t interested in
giving up on the farm he had worked so hard to build.&quot;
Coldly Jan continued, &quot;So they sent their boys out to
drive us off the land.&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Bonnie managed faintly.

&quot;I still don&#39;t know which of the six gunmen opened
fire first,&quot; Jan said bleakly, &quot;but Mom and Dad died
in just the first few minutes. My sister Amy died
next, but I hid in the hayloft....&quot; Her voice finally
broke, and a single tear trickled down her cheek.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Bonnie reached out to put her hand on
Jan&#39;s arm, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have asked.&quot;

&quot;None of them were charged,&quot; Jan&#39;s managed, &quot;not the
rancher or anyone else, and I understood exactly what
you could buy with money and a gun.&quot; Grimly she
continued, &quot;So I decided to beat them at their own
game.&quot;

&quot;And became a gunfighter,&quot; Bonnie finished. She looked
at Jan, at that pain filled face and asked, &quot;The men
who killed your family, you found them didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Each and every one,&quot; Jan answered, her voice rough,
&quot;not that any of it helped me feel any better. The
rancher himself... I got him over a year ago, it&#39;s
where I got my ship from, too.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re still doing this...?&quot; Bonnie said.

&quot;It&#39;s the only way of life I know now,&quot; Jan answered
her simply, &quot;and it&#39;s the only thing that I&#39;m good
at.&quot;

Bonnie opened her mouth to say something, then seemed
to change her mind. Instead she said, &quot;We&#39;d better
head in, the first homesteaders are coming in
tomorrow.&quot; Wryly she added, &quot;It&#39;s going to be a long
day for both of us.&quot;

&quot;Got that right,&quot; Jan agreed as they walked inside
together.

The next day had Jan waiting out on the street, eyes
shaded by the new hat that she wore. Not far away the
sheriff stood talking with the grocer, the older woman
keeping an eye on things. Jan had met with Heather
Gallant that morning, explaining to the gray haired
woman that she wanted to arrest Tyler, not simply gun
him down, and to do that she&#39;d need the officer&#39;s
support.

&#39;Not that we know he&#39;s even coming in today,&#39; Jan
thought, studying the riders and wagons passing by
into town. They were lucky in that the best land was
to the north of town, so the majority of people coming
here were from that direction.

Bonnie stepped out from her dance hall, the gorgeous
redhead looking across to where Jan sat in the shade
by the City Hall. Jan gave her a nod, watching the
woman return indoors even as she thought, &#39;I can&#39;t
believe I told her all that, I haven&#39;t told the whole
story in... well, forever.&#39;

The first wagons had begun to arrive, but none of the
men driving them seemed familiar. Not that Tyler
couldn&#39;t be in disguise, but after how long Jan had
been studying his face she was confident she could
spot him. She could feel the eyes of the homesteaders
on her, the fear that her gunfighter insignia brought
on and felt a odd mix of satisfaction and irritation.

The wagon was one of the last to come in that day, the
man comfortably sitting in front as he used the reins
to guide the horses in. He was casual, almost relaxed
as he brought the car through the gate at the edge of
town, then he got a good look at the woman sitting
there in a rickety chair. He tensed, those eyes behind
the glasses widening even as he tried to hurry the
horses.

&quot;Tyler,&quot; Jan rose smoothly, trying to look casual as
she said, &quot;you really didn&#39;t think hitching a ride on
a settlement ship was going to be enough?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going back,&quot; Tyler&#39;s lenses shone in the
twilight as he tried to sound innocent, &quot;those charges
are a load of....&quot;

&quot;Tell it to the judge,&quot; Heather moved up to the other
side, &quot;you&#39;ll be seeing one soon enough.&quot; She met his
eyes, looking oddly motherly, &quot;We&#39;d all prefer this be
settled peacefully, sir.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be a cold day in hell,&quot; Tyler vowed as he
leaped from the wagon, letting the horses run wild.
Reins flapping loosely the horses raced forward,
anyone still on the street racing away in a panic.

&quot;Then I guess we&#39;ll just have to do this the hard
way,&quot; Jan swung her coat back, revealing the pistols
at her side.

Tyler gestured, a pistol dropping from a concealed
device on his wrist into his hand. Before Jan could
draw the gun discharged once, then twice, red
splattering the lanky woman&#39;s clothes as the bullets
struck home.

&quot;NO!&quot; Bonnie cried out, even as Jan swayed.

The gunfighter&#39;s hand came up, her pistol rock steady
as she aimed. &quot;Not only are you a murderous crook,&quot;
Jan managed, &quot;but you&#39;re a terrible shot, too.&quot;

BANG!

Tyler dropped bonelessly to the ground, red blossoming
on the center of his shirt. Almost at the same time
Jan fell, dropping to lay there on the dusty street.
Heather and Bonnie rushed to her side even as the
townspeople gazed in shock and horror at the blood
that had been shed.

&quot;Is she...?&quot; Bonnie demanded, looking at Jan then
Heather anxiously.

&quot;We&#39;ll need to get the doctor,&quot; Heather said after a
moments examination, &quot;but I think nothing critical&#39;s
been hit.&quot;

&quot;Told you he was a rotten shot,&quot; Jan managed, wincing
in pain as she moved. She sighed, &quot;I really need to
find a new line of work.&quot;

An excerpt from the Encyclopedia Galactica, 2345
Edition, continued:

....while no miracle cures became available, medical
technology remained quite effective, even out on the
frontier. Non-fatal injuries could be rapidly mended,
only the heart or brain remained a serious issue for
medical science.

The light slowly grew in the corner room, illuminating
the figure laying on the bed. Black hair fell into a
face made peaceful by sleep, covered by the pure white
blankets. Slowly she stirred, movement starting in the
outer limbs then behind her eyelids.

&quot;I know you&#39;re alive,&quot; the voice said softly, but with
a certain amount of amusement, &quot;no one who was dead
could snore so much.&quot;

Jan opened her eyes to see Bonnie&#39;s amused face
looking down at her. With as much dignity as she could
muster she said, &quot;I do not snore.&quot;

&quot;Considering several of the girls have been helping me
keep an eye on you,&quot; Bonnie said, &quot;I have a few
witnesses on my side.&quot;

Deciding not to pursue that Jan forced herself to sit
up, wincing a bit as she barely healed wounds
protested. &quot;Tyler?&quot; she asked crisply.

&quot;Dead,&quot; Bonnie answered, &quot;and from what Heather tells
me he was wanted dead or alive, so you should still be
fine.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine anyway,&quot; Jan found herself admitting, &quot;I
don&#39;t really need the money anymore. I have more saved
than I need....&quot;

Bonnie got up to open the curtains and a window,
bringing light and fresh air into the room. &quot;Were you
serious when you said you wanted a new line of work?&quot;
Bonnie asked.

&quot;I&#39;m always serious,&quot; Jan answered quietly.

&quot;I&#39;ve been lacking a bouncer for awhile now,&quot; Bonnie
said to her evenly, &quot;so how would you like the job?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not qualified....&quot; Jan blinked.

&quot;After seeing you in action last week,&quot; Bonnie flashed
a smile, &quot;I think your presence alone in the room
would keep rowdy customers under control.&quot;

Jan met Bonnie&#39;s eyes and saw a silent appeal in them,
along with a gentle warmth that she hadn&#39;t really
expected. &quot;All right,&quot; Jan offered her hand, &quot;you&#39;ve
got yourself a deal.&quot;

A beginning....

Author&#39;s Notes: the idea for a science fiction western
has been bouncing around my head for awhile now, in
various forms and drafts. It&#39;s been a fanfiction,
romance and even a horror story in various
incarnations. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be adding to this
or not, I&#39;m certainly open to the idea but it depends
if inspiration strikes. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this.
