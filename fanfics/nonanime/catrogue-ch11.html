<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Sage sat there gazing at Heather blankly for a few moments, trying to 
absorb what she had just said to her. &quot;You really do live up to the 
name Lifeguard,&quot; she finally quietly, and took a small drink of her 
can of soda.

Heather smiled slightly and shrugged, &quot;Depends who I&#39;m guarding.&quot; The 
tall blonde pushed her hair back, seeming a bit nervous. She looked 
up, meeting Sage&#39;s eyes, &quot;So Lady Mastermind didn&#39;t do you any lasting 
damage?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a little jumpy,&quot; Sage admitted. &quot;I hadn&#39;t really though about how 
vulnerable I am to psychic attack,&quot; she said quietly.

Heather silently considered her next words, taking in Sage&#39;s 
appearance. The girl really did look shaken, her calm poise gone for 
now. &quot;If you want,&quot; she offered, &quot;you can stay here with me tonight.&quot; 
At Sage&#39;s startled glance she smiled gently, &quot;Totally platonic, I 
promise. My power should kick in to help if Mastermind tries 
anything.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Sage started to say, then she trailed off. She really wanted to 
be able to turn down the offer, to maintain her usual tough and self- 
reliant image. But she was scared. &quot;I&#39;d like to,&quot; she startled herself 
by saying.



&quot;You know what we haven&#39;t done in a while?&quot; Kitty asked as she and 
Rogue walked hand in hand back to the house.

Rogue looked at her in surprise, &quot;But we did it last night!&quot;

Kitty blushed fiercely, &quot;Not that!&quot;

Rogue laughed softly, &quot;Sorry, I shouldn&#39;t tease.&quot; She smiled, &quot;What 
haven&#39;t we done?&quot; She opened the door and waved Kitty through in a 
gentlemanly fashion.

&quot;Thank you very much, kind sir,&quot; Kitty smiled. &quot;We haven&#39;t sat down to 
watch some anime in a while,&quot; Kitty sighed.

&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; Rogue slipped her arm around Kitty&#39;s shoulders. 
&quot;Let&#39;s go get some munchies and do it,&quot; she said. Bags of chips and 
some pop were quickly collected, and they headed down the hall to 
their room.

&quot;I wonder where everybody is,&quot; Kitty frowned.

&quot;Ororo&#39;s out talking to Jean, Psylocke and Neal are eating out, 
Bishop&#39;s on police duty, and,&quot; Rogue paused meaningfully, &quot;Sage has 
gone to see Heather tonight.&quot;

&quot;Oh ho!&quot; Kitty exclaimed. &quot;Think we should start another betting pool 
on them this time?&quot; Kitty asked with a grin.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Rogue smiled back. They paused by their door and Rogue&#39;s eyes 
widened as she heard something, &quot;There&#39;s somebody in there.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Kitty frowned. She put her hand on Rogue&#39;s shoulder and 
quietly said, &quot;I&#39;ll phase us through the door on three, OK?&quot;

Rogue nodded grimly.

&quot;One... two... three!&quot; and Kitty slipped them both through the door, 
each ready for anything that awaited them!

Well, almost anything. Mystique sat cross-legged on their bed, 
watching the anime Read or Die and chuckling softly to herself. She 
smiled as she saw them come in, &quot;I wonder if they modeled Miss Deep on 
you, Kitty.&quot;

&quot;Mom!&quot; Rogue exclaimed. &quot;What are you doing in here?&quot; she asked.

Mystique looked a bit sheepish. &quot;I got bored waiting for Ororo to get 
back,&quot; she shrugged, &quot;and I noticed the tape in the VCR.&quot; She raised 
her eyebrows at the bags of munchies they were carrying. &quot;Planing a 
little show?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Kitty said. Rogue looked at Kitty, conveying a 
silent question. Kitty nodded to her with a smile.

&quot;Would you like to join us?&quot; Rogue smiled at her mom.

Mystique grinned, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;

Kitty stopped the tape, &quot;Would you like to see something naughty but 
fun?&quot;

Rogue raised her eyebrow, &quot;Did Stevie send you something?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, after I told her about us in my last letter,&quot; Kitty grinned. 
&quot;She said the video would be really appropriate,&quot; she shrugged.

&quot;I wonder what that means?&quot; Mystique smiled.

&quot;Only one way to find out,&quot; Rogue shrugged.

&quot;Let&#39;s try it,&quot; Kitty smiled, and after they all settled comfortably 
into their seats slipped a tape labeled &#39;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&#39; 
into the VCR.



&quot;Lucas!&quot; Bishop heard someone call out behind him, &quot;Hey, Lucas 
Bishop!&quot; An officer he didn&#39;t immediately recognize came jogging up to 
him, &quot;I heard you helped stop that attack on the city a few days 
back.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I did,&quot; Bishop smiled back at her.

&quot;Nice work,&quot; she grinned up at him. &quot;My name&#39;s Cat, Catrine Grays is 
you want to be formal&quot; the little blonde bowed slightly, &quot;and I&#39;m 
you&#39;re new partner.&quot;

&quot;But what happened to...?&quot; he started to ask.

&quot;Out on maternity leave,&quot; Cat grinned. It was obvious that this 
cheerful young lady was up on all the office gossip. &quot;Have you heard 
about the best?&quot; she asked him.

He blinked, &quot;Best what?&quot;

&quot;The best there is,&quot; Cat grinned, &quot;the best fighter in the world. I&#39;ve 
heard that it&#39;s in Australia, and that the best is a woman!&quot;

&#39;The word&#39;s already spread into law enforcement?&#39; Bishop thought, 
surprised.

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Cat continued cheerfully, &quot;whoever it is has kept a low 
profile, so far. No really big property damaging brawls so far.&quot;

&quot;Thankfully,&quot; Bishop smiled. &quot;Has the chief decided how to handle it?&quot; 
he asked.

&quot;As long as whoever she is keeps a low profile,&quot; Cat shrugged, &quot;we 
leave it alone. But if something big happens, we may have to take 
action.&quot;

Bishop raised an eyebrow, &quot;If she really is the best, what exactly are 
we supposed to do?&quot;

Cat looked at him thoughtful, &quot;I doubt they&#39;ve thought that far 
ahead.&quot; She grabbed his arm, &quot;You just going off shift, too?&quot;

Bishop barely had the chance to give her a nod when she said, &quot;Then 
let&#39;s go get some dinner, get to know each other better.&quot;

The much shorter woman nearly dragged him along before Cat stopped to 
ask him, &quot;Oh, do you have a girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Bishop managed.

&quot;A big, hunky guy like you?&quot; Cat exclaimed. &quot;That&#39;s a crying shame,&quot; 
she sighed cutely. &quot;Not that I&#39;m one to talk, being single too,&quot; and 
she continued on, not giving Bishop much of a chance to even get a 
word in edgewise.



Mystique was snickering to herself softly, while both Kitty and Rogue 
were blushing slightly as the closing credits began to roll. &quot;Did you 
know that this was Alice in Wonderland done mildly lesbian?&quot; she asked 
Kitty with a smile.

&quot;Knowing Stevie&#39;s sense of humor, I probably should have guessed,&quot; 
Kitty admitted, still blushing fiercely.

&quot;The mad tea party was pretty good,&quot; Rogue laughed, thinking of the 
female Mad Hatter climbing all over the cartoon&#39;s main character.

&quot;Not to mention the red queen,&quot; Kitty smiled. She looked thoughtful, 
&quot;I kept having Emma Frost flashbacks, though.&quot;

Mystique raised her eyebrow, &quot;Oh, really?&quot;

Kitty paused the tape, &quot;Well, I did end up held to a chair by her 
mind.&quot;

&quot;Ooh, bondage!&quot; Rogue explained. &quot;Did she break out the whips and 
chains, too?&quot; she asked with a impish smile.

Kitty blushed harder, &quot;No!&quot;

The door opened, and Ororo walked in. &quot;Did I just hear what I thought 
I heard?&quot; she asked them with a smile.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, love,&quot; Mystique got up to kiss Ororo gently, &quot;we were 
just talking about a anime we were watching.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got to see this,&quot; Ororo smiled, &quot;would you mind if I joined 
you?&quot;

Mystique looked over at Kitty and Rogue, who both smiled willingly. 
Mystique shifted a bit on the bed, &quot;Climb on up.&quot;

It&#39;s quite hard to maintain one&#39;s dignity while climbing up to sit on 
a bed with three other occupants on it. Though Kitty noticed that 
Ororo did try her best. &quot;Do you want to watch the other episode?&quot; 
Kitty asked the others.

&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Rogue laughed. Kitty started up the tape again, and the 
words &#39;Miyuki-chan in Mirrorland&#39; came up.



Sage hesitated, and Heather smiled at her gently. She handed her a set 
of pajama&#39;s, &quot;These belong to my brother, but you&#39;re slim enough they 
should fit.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sage blushed, taking them into her hands.

Thankfully, Heather took her own set of pajama&#39;s and then went into 
the bathroom to get changed. Sage slipped her tight black bodysuit 
quite efficiently, soon standing there in her underwear. She quickly 
pulled the blue pajama&#39;s on, a bit baggy but comfortable none the 
less.

Heather came out of the bathroom, and Sage felt her breath just stop. 
The pajama&#39;s were doing their best to hide the tall blonde&#39;s figure, 
but they were failing miserably. The athletic beauty was stunning, and 
Sage had to remind herself to breathe before she fainted.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Heather asked worriedly, &quot;You look kind of pale. 
Well, paler than you normally do, anyway.&quot;

Sage blushed, surprised to be caught staring. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she managed.

Heather rolled down the covers and invited Sage, &quot;Pick a side.&quot; Sage 
noticed that one side had a depression where Heather normally slept, 
so she decided to slip in to the opposite side.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Heather said, climbing in beside her. The lights went out, 
and the room was plunged into darkness.

Sage lay there stiffly for a few moments, then she felt gentle arms 
wrap around her body. &quot;What?&quot; she gasped softly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Heather&#39;s soft voice tickled her ear, &quot;I&#39;ll protect 
you, I promise.&quot; Strangely, those words actually seemed to help. Sage 
found herself relaxing, and soon she was fast asleep.

Heather sighed to herself softly, feeling Sage spooned into her own 
body. &#39;This is going to be a long night,&#39; she thought to herself.
