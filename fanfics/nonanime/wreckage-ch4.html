<a href="../nonanime/wreckage-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Carol Danvers typed away at her desk, smiling faintly
as her fingers flew across the computer keyboard. She
was working on putting the last few touches on her
latest article, her third one of the day. With the
small staff at the Herald there was a lot of space in
the paper to be filled by their reporters, and the
blonde was discovering she sort of enjoyed it.

&quot;Yo, Danvers!&quot; Ron Black yelled from his office.

Saving her work Carol got up, leaving the rows of
desks that were occupied by busy reporters and headed
over to the editors office. &quot;Yes sir?&quot; she asked him
meekly, well aware that she was still on probation
here.

&quot;Don&#39;t look so worried,&quot; Ron looked up at her mildly,
&quot;you&#39;ve been doing good work.&quot; The editor rummaged
around the messy desk until the equally messy man
finally found a print out that he gave her, &quot;What do
you know about this?&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Carol frowned as she quickly read the news
release. Apparently Olivia Stane wasn&#39;t wasting any
time, loosely describing her new planned superteam and
sketching out what she hoped to do with them. No
members were actually named, but she did say that
several &#39;prominent&#39; superheroes were involved. &quot;Might
not be anything much,&quot; she said to him, &quot;I notice she
hasn&#39;t got anyone named as being on board yet.&quot;

&quot;Pretty much what I thought,&quot; Ron agreed as he ran a
hand through his thinning hair, &quot;but keep an eye on
it, will ya?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I will,&quot; Carol agreed.

Returning to her desk Carol fought back a flash of
irritation at the news. Part of her was very tempted
to call up Olivia Stane and tell her off for jumping
the gun, especially considering that she and
Thunderstrike hadn&#39;t even agreed to join yet, but she
restrained herself. &#39;It could be she had other
superhumans on tap, too,&#39; she thought.

A soft chime from her computer signaled an email had
come in, and opening up the program Carol noted it was
from her friend Jessica Jones. &quot;I finished up the
background checks,&quot; Jessica wrote, &quot;Stane checks out
clean as a whistle, though I still need to do some
digging on her life in Japan. Jackie Lucas is a
different story, however.&quot;

&#39;Stane was in Japan for awhile?&#39; Carol blinked in
surprise, then frowned as she remembered something
that Jackie had said to her. &#39;She did tell me to look
into her own background,&#39; Carol recalled the other
hero&#39;s parting words.

&quot;Once upon a time Jackie was a supervillain called
Bloodaxe,&quot; Jessica revealed, &quot;who fought
Thunderstrike. Apparently she was under the control of
an enchanted weapon, one that later enslaved T-strike
himself. She had some run ins with the law when she
was younger, but since her supervillain period she&#39;s
been clean as a whistle.&quot;

After composing a fast &#39;thank you&#39; email to Jessica
Carol went back to work, finishing off the article on
a group of minor crooks who called themselves the
Raiders. Wearing matching costumes and using advanced
weapons they had hit banks in different parts of the
city, quickly cleaning out the vaults of valuables
before the police could arrive.

&#39;I wonder if Warbird should look into this?&#39; Carol
wondered before a presence by her desk made her look
up.

&quot;Did Ron scold you?&quot; Monica Stewart asked, the older
redhead smiling down at Carol impishly. She looked
good, as usual, wearing casual clothes that helped
bring out her fine figure.

&quot;No, he just gave me a heads up on a new story,&quot; Carol
answered pleasantly. There was something almost earthy
about the other woman, a nearly hedonistic quality
that drew Carol in. &#39;Probably because I&#39;m nearly the
opposite of that these days,&#39; she noted.

&quot;Good,&quot; Monica grinned. She dropped her voice a bit,
&quot;A few of the guys are a bit cross with you,
especially over you getting a front page story so
soon.&quot;

Carol smiled wryly, knowing exactly what she meant. At
a paper like this there was a certain pecking order,
and her arrival had probably shaken that up a little.
&#39;Then add in my getting a scoop so fast and you have a
recipe for trouble.&#39; she thought. &quot;They&#39;ll just have
to manage:&quot; she said mildly, &quot;or maybe they&#39;d like to
switch jobs with me?&quot;

That got a snort of laughter from Monica, &quot;Take over
crime? Not likely.&quot; She looked at Carol impishly, &quot;So,
do you want to join a few of us for drinks?&quot;

Carol hesitated, &quot;Would anyone be offended if I don&#39;t
drink any booze?&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Monica smiled slightly, &quot;No, Elisa down in
accounting doesn&#39;t drink, either. She&#39;ll be glad to
have the company.&quot;

&quot;All right then,&quot; Carol finished up her work, saving
the document then mailing it over to editorial.
Grabbing her coat from the back of her chair she
followed Monica out of the bullpen, &quot;So, what should I
expect?&quot;

&quot;All women pretty much,&quot; Monica said as they took the
old elevator down, &quot;most of us have enough of our
boyfriends during the week. There&#39;s on average five or
six of us, depending on who&#39;s available, and they&#39;re
all pretty nice.&quot;

&quot;Other reporters?&quot; Carol asked curiously.

&quot;Just you and I,&quot; Monica flashed a grin. &quot;There&#39;s
Elisa and Heather from accounting, Bette from
shipping, Catty from records and Lynn from
maintenance,&quot; she said, &quot;as well as any guests they
may haul along.&quot;

&quot;I guess that&#39;s why the number varies?&quot; Carol guessed.

&quot;Yup.&quot; They exited into the parking garage as Monica
continued, &quot;We usually meet over at a dive called the
Oasis, do you want to follow me or ride with me
there?&quot;

Carol thought of the various ways this night could go
bad and smiled, &quot;I think I&#39;ll follow you there,
thanks.&quot;

The amused look in Monica&#39;s eyes clearly showed she
guessed what Carol was thinking but she just smiled
and teased, &quot;Chicken.&quot; She lead the way out of the
garage in a older Toyota, Carol meekly following her
in her sport&#39;s car.

LA at night was as varied as any city in the world,
with the best and worst side by side and cheek to
cheek. Carol again found herself relaxing as they
drove, moving across town until they arrived at a club
off the main drag, decorated in a faux island theme.
Despite the cheesy exterior with neon palm trees the
Oasis was comfortable inside, with subdued lighting
and a nice atmosphere.

&quot;Hey Monica,&quot; a tall brunette waved to them from a
corner table, a smile of welcome on her pretty face.

&quot;That&#39;s Bette,&quot; Monica chuckled softly as she lead
Carol over to them, cheerfully adding, &quot;she&#39;s not
nearly as brash as she looks.&quot;

The corner table had a interesting mix of people, all
with slightly different looks. Bette sat at one end,
then a elegant black haired woman in a business suit.
Beside her in sweats was a mousy brown haired girl,
and beside her was a dynamite blonde. Finally a tough
looking lady with a sparkling red/gold tint in her
hair sat at the other end.

&quot;About time you got here,&quot; the elegant woman drank
from her glass of gingerale as if it was filled with
the finest wine.

&quot;Elisa, you are so anal,&quot; Monica shook her head. She
smiled over at Carol, &quot;You can imagine why she got
into accounting.&quot; She addressed the table, &quot;Everyone,
I&#39;d like you to meet the Herald&#39;s newest crime
reporter, Carol Danvers.&quot;

Carol had to fight back a smile.

&quot;I&#39;m Heather,&quot; the mousy young woman smiled, &quot;don&#39;t
mind Elisa, she always gets grouchy when she has to
add a new employee to the rolls.&quot;

The dynamite blonde grinned, &quot;I&#39;m Catty, welcome
aboard.&quot; She patted a empty chair at the table, &quot;Grab
a seat.&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask,&quot; Monica said as she and
Carol sat. &quot;Anybody order yet?&quot; she asked them
curiously.

&quot;Lynn,&quot; the woman with reddish gold hair smiled at
Carol then Lynn addressed Monica, &quot;No, we were just
waiting for you to arrive.&quot;

&quot;Since you&#39;re new,&quot; Monica looked at Carol, &quot;any
preferences?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s good here?&quot; Carol addressed the table. She
grinned as charmingly as she could and added, &quot;I bow
to your superior wisdom.&quot;

Heather chuckled at that, reaching over to pat Carol&#39;s
hand as she purred, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll take very good
care of you.&quot;

&quot;Especially Heather,&quot; Monica laughed, &quot;are you still
looking for a girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Monica,&quot; Lynn scolded, &quot;you shouldn&#39;t spring
something like that on a new comer like that.&quot;

Carol looked at Heather in surprise, &quot;You&#39;re...?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Heather blushed then tossed a glare at Monica,
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Miss Blunt there decided to blurt that
out.&quot;

Carol hastened to reassure her, &quot;It&#39;s all right,
really.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Elisa gave her a thoughtful look.

Carol felt everyone&#39;s eyes on her and blushed. &quot;As
cliched as it sounds,&quot; Carol said with as much dignity
as she could muster, &quot;some of my best friends are
lesbians.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry everyone,&quot; Catty said, the dynamite
looking blonde tossing Carol a sympathetic glance, &quot;we
can always grill her about her romantic background
later. For now, let&#39;s have dinner!&quot;</pre>
