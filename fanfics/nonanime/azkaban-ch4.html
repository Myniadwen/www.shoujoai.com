<h1>Azkaban (part 4 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/azkaban-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>If Alicia&#146;s fears about her letter writing abilities when it came to 
Hermione seemed unfounded that night when Harry came to the Leaky 
Cauldron, they were soon justified and well founded fears as each and 
every day passed.

Each day she would get an owl back from Hermione (cursing her fortune 
that only Cho knew well enough to wait until she finished her letter 
before sending it back with Chii), and each day her letters became 
more and more lengthy and gibbering. She began to feel that she was 
truly becoming a gossiping little girl everytime she penned a letter 
to Hermione.

Her letters to Cho Chang were not so blathering, and she also felt 
more at ease speaking her mind and her feelings more openly than with 
Hermione. Hermione she was too flustered to do much but blither on 
about the day&#146;s events, but Cho was different. &#147;Maybe I&#146;m pursuing the 
wrong girl.&#148; Alicia wrote in a letter once to Cho, only to get this 
reply : &#147;I&#146;ll let you know when I&#146;m available. Keep going after 
Hermione for now.&#148;

Now that was a weird response. But she did as Cho asked, and didn&#146;t 
push the topic of a relationship again, at least not until she was 
ready for one.

The day&#146;s activities? Not much to go over, really.

She&#146;d start with breakfast, and being her happy go lucky self again 
she had an easier time chatting it up with the witches and wizards 
than she did before remembrance day. With the weight of that event off 
her shoulders for another year she was her old good natured self 
again.

Though of course some of it was show to make her time with the 
&#147;locals&#148; easier to manage, she still showed abit of real humor and 
good natured-ness while conversing so it wasn&#146;t all an act.

The most interesting thing she saw was what Harry thought was a hag, 
who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a tick woolen balaclava. 
Turned out to be a rather fit 30-ish year old witch with blazing pink 
hair. &#147;BAD HAIR POTION!&#148; she cried, covering her hair again. It took a 
few minutes, but Alicia talked her to put her covering down and relish 
her new hair as a eye catching thing to get a boy (or girl&#146;s) 
attention.

That was yesterday. Today Alicia nearly fell over when that same witch 
came back in, dressed like a girl half her age and hugging the arm of 
another &#147;born again&#148; 30-ish witch with purple hair on her head. She 
then went on to say how she had accidentally bought the wrong &#147;Gilded 
Lock-hearts&#148; hair potion but then recommended it to her companion 
after she began to love the results and -- &#147;Yup. Definitely created a 
monster.&#148; she sighed, wondering just how many &#147;born again&#148; 30 year 
olds was Gildroy Lockhart going to inspire with his hair potions. The 
thought sent a cold shiver down Alicia&#146;s spine, mostly because (as a 
human being with years added from her birth to death, and to now) she 
was 30-ish in years. &#145;Does that make me a bad person to chase girls 
half my age?&#146; she thought as she finished breakfast and headed into 
Diagon Alley.

For the past several days she had been wandering the alley, so much so 
that she now knew the entire length of Diagon Alley from back to 
front, even the &#147;Darker&#148; aspects of Knockturn Alley, but mostly to 
indulge in her more &#147;adult&#148; needs. By now, however, she had gotten a 
bad rep in Knockturn Alley as being abit of a &#147;loose girl of 
questionable morals&#148;, but then again she also had a lot of dirt on the 
regulars of the alley so they kept her &#147;activities&#148; to themselves. 
After all, it wasn&#146;t her fault that they kept their most guilty 
thoughts floating at the top of their &#147;heads&#148; for an easy pick up from 
anyone sensitive enough to hear those thoughts.

As for her &#147;loose girl&#148; morals? It was only once this week, and not 
even with one of &#147;those girls&#148;. She once spied a &#147;Black Widow&#148; type 
witch skulking the alleys. She was quite beautiful, and used those 
looks to stalk male wizards where she proposition them for activities 
of a sexual nature, then tapped them for whatever Galleons were on 
them and whatever good magical items she could steal. Alicia was in 
the mood, she was right there, so she simply changed her form into a 
male (which was easy since Ravens could take either gender form 
without much hassle) and took her offer. The &#147;loose girl&#148; thing? Came 
from those who saw the results. When the &#147;Black Widow&#148; came out again 
from a nearby small inn she was dazed, shaky in the legs, and looked 
as if she was just run over by the Hogwarts Express. When an 
unsuspecting male (who was about to ask her for her services) tried to 
speak to her, she simply jumped into his arms screaming &#147;I&#146;M SORRY!! 
I&#146;LL NEVER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MEN AGAIN!!!&#148; (the fact that Alicia came 
out seconds later grinning like a cat and looking guilty as hell just 
dug her own grave in that particular incident).

She&#146;ll be the first one to tell you this : she&#146;s no angel.

She doesn&#146;t believe in false moralities, nor does she practice 
platitudes or false moral uprightness. She simply states that she, as 
a woman, has her needs. If she wants to fulfill them? Those are her 
priorities, and not to be judged by others. She does as she wishes, 
and acts as she pleases, devil be damned and to hell with whoever 
disagrees with her.

When she wasn&#146;t spending the nights blathering to Hermione in letters, 
or (a few times) having a little fun with the locals, she worked on 
her scrolls and homework. Luckily for her she took Harry&#146;s advice and 
started sitting outside of Florean Fortescue&#146;s Ice Cream Parlor 
finishing her essays, which was easy on one part because Florean 
Fortescue himself helped them with their medieval witch burning essays 
(cutting out a lot of the questionable stuff from Alicia&#146;s while 
keeping the spirit of it intact). He even once introduced her to a 
descendent of Wedelin the Weird for part of her essay. The next day 
Harry asked how her paper was coming, &#147;The fire thing must be a family 
addiction.&#148; she mused, toying with her food. &#147;She made me &#147;burn&#148; her 
four times before she gave me what I wanted.&#148;

&#147;So she helped you with your essay?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148; (blushes) &#147;Yeah. The essay. Uh-huh. Right.&#148;

She still wasn&#146;t finished, mostly since that wasn&#145;t the thing she 
&#147;wanted&#147; from Wendy (Wedelin&#145;s descendant) in the first place.

The first thing Alicia wished everytime she went back to Gringotts to 
refill her pouch was &#147;I wish they gave out &#147;credit cards&#148; here.&#148;, 
feeling her tesseract pouches as she filled them with coins.

One pouch for Gold Galleons, one for Silver Sickles, one for Bronze 
Knuts, and one for miscellaneous treasures she &#147;pocketed&#148; from 
&#147;people&#148;. Her money? Since she continued to &#147;launder&#148; the ill gains of 
the wicked she &#147;exorcised&#148; from the living? She had more than enough 
to last her two lifetimes, yet she still practiced a great deal of 
restraint nevertheless.

&#147;Set of solid gold Gobstones!&#148; the merchant bragged, showing her the 
set. She poked at it huffing her breath at the useless things, that is 
until one of the stones squirted her with a nasty smelling liquid. The 
merchant gave her the counter-liquid to wash it off, after a gentle 
&#147;reminder&#148; from her on good customer relations when he tried to sell 
her the counter-liquid.

&#147;Perfect moving model of the galaxy! Set in this indestructible glass 
sphere, it guarantees that you&#146;ll never have to take another Astronomy 
lesson ever again!&#148;

What Alicia told the merchant she wanted to see in one of those 
spheres nearly gave the man a heart attack. She decided not to ask 
again unless in the &#147;proper&#148; store.

What tested her resolve, however, came when she passed Harry at 
Quality Quidditch Supplies, and noticed the large crowd. She stood 
behind Harry, slowly moving along to get a better look at what they 
were all looking at. &#147;What?&#148; she whispered, trying to get a better 
view, &#147;Somebody released a Nimbus 2002? What?!&#148;

&#147;Just come out -- prototype --&#148; somebody said, &#147;It&#146;s the fastest broom 
in the world, isn&#146;t it, Dad?&#148;

&#147;Irish International Side&#146;s just put in an order for seven of these 
beauties! And they&#145;re favorites for the World Cup!&#148;

Alicia was becoming annoyed that she heard the hype, but had yet to 
see the merchandise. Finally someone got out of the way and they both 
saw the item in question.

THE FIREBOLT

This state-of-the-art racing broom sports a streamlined---

Blah, blah, blah blah.

Alicia quickly sped down the list to the price. She could always 
figure out the optional extras when she bought one.

Price on Request.

Alicia&#146;s teeth ground together as she began to tense up, her palms 
sweaty.

Now she knew how guys felt when near an ego-rubbing vehicle or, dare 
she think it, broom. She looked at the flawless beauty and thought 
only one thing, &#145;Gotta get Hermione on it.&#146;

Briefly she let her thoughts wander away, and she imagined Hermione, 
naked and beautiful in the moonlight, sitting with legs crossed and 
eyes glittering on the broom as it floated in midair, a come hither 
look in her eyes as she reached her hand out to gesture for--

&#147;ACK!&#148; Alicia hissed, quickly spinning away and walking out of the 
store as fast as possible.

&#145;No way!&#146; she thought angrily, &#145;She&#146;d never do that! Stupid wet dream 
idea!&#146;

Still, the thought of seducing her on such a fine broom kind of 
appealed to her, but she quickly shook it off. Anyway, as she figured, 
she already had a nice broom in her Nimbus 2001 she got the first year 
she was eligible to buy her own broom. And since Hermione hadn&#146;t 
offered to ride barebroom yet for her she figured it was never going 
to happen. Still, the thought --

She struggled with that for awhile, mostly gritting her teeth and 
trying to put it out of her mind.

She even asked Cho about it and she replied with a &#147;She&#146;s too much of 
a lady for such things.&#148; but then went on to say &#147;I&#146;d like to see what 
that feels like though, one day.&#148;

Cho Chang. A puzzle wrapped in an enigma riddled with contradicting 
thoughts. Getting to know her better only made her that much harder to 
understand. Still, she was honest at least. As for the idea? The 
mirror didn&#146;t seem at all interested in helping Alicia figure out if 
she really did look sexy sitting on her Nimbus 2001 in the buff. It 
just yawned and fell back asleep.

&#147;Maybe I should ask a living person next time.&#148; she lamented, crawling 
back into bed to sleep.

Of course there was things that Alicia simply had to buy for school.

She went over to the Apothecary to fill out the list of potion 
ingredients that Snape sent her. She was, it seems, the only student 
at Hogwarts who wasn&#146;t a Slytherin AND capable of having a decent 
conversation with Snape without being forced to speak to him. They 
both, after all, held secrets. She learned his the first night she 
returned in the second year and he bitched her, Harry and Ron out for 
being late and the flying car thing. He lost his temper so badly that 
a few random thoughts floated to the top, thoughts he normally kept 
hidden. It didn&#146;t take long for her to figure out, while researching 
about the school&#146;s past, what the images meant. She thought he might 
have been a disciple of the Darke Raven, but instead Snape, it seems, 
was once a Death Eater (one of good ole&#146; Voldemort&#146;s followers). She 
didn&#146;t care abit, she was only looking for followers of the Darke 
Raven who might have been searching the school for the rumored Darke 
Raven &#147;Heart&#148; lying within it&#146;s walls. Still, she didn&#146;t miss a beat 
in holding it over his head like a hammer and threatening him with it. 
When she felt, however, she pushed him far enough? She gave him her 
dirty bag of secrets in return and made him a deal : they each keep 
the other&#146;s secrets over their heads, and in return they become 
ambicle &#147;partners&#148; while she was at the school, keeping young &#147;Mr. 
Potter&#148; alive while staying out of each other&#146;s way. Given no choice 
in the matter he agreed, and they&#146;ve been &#147;partners&#148; since.

It was with the list, however, that he also wrote &#147;Someone told the 
Headmaster about your recent run in with those youths and how they 
were murdered. He doesn&#146;t suspect you were involved, but I think he 
plans on speaking to you when you return to school, be mindful of that 
in case he summons you. Still, I think it best you tell me what role 
you played in their demises.&#148;

Alicia wrote back &#147;I didn&#146;t kill them, however that&#146;s not to say that 
I was saddened by their demise. They were animals, and I&#146;m glad 
they&#146;re dead. You won&#146;t see me mourn their passing.&#148;

Snape hadn&#146;t written back yet. Obviously he was taken aback by her 
words, or just silently agreeing with her feelings. Either way? He 
didn&#146;t answer and she figured the topic closed.

She had to buy robes, mostly as a show since she usually used her 
Raven &#147;Uniform&#148; as her &#147;robes&#148; (form changed into the spitting image 
of Hogwarts robes), but occasionally she used them -- mostly for after 
baths as bathrobes. And, of course, she had to buy books.

After her birthday she wrote to Hermione and Ron offering to buy their 
books this year. Mostly to get the chance to &#147;buy&#148; Hermione something, 
and using Ron as a &#147;cover&#148; so she couldn&#146;t point to Ron and ask why 
she was only lavishing her with books. &#147;Ron needs books too.&#148; she 
might have complained, or something like that.

Ron&#146;s list was the same as her&#146;s, so that was no shock. The shock came 
when she saw Hermione&#146;s list. There was more books than the hours of 
the day could provide Hermione with a chance to go to all the classes 
these books entailed. &#147;What the--&#148; she rasped, looking at the list. 
&#147;What kind of nutter signs up for so many classes?!?&#148;

&#147;---maybe she has a lot of time on her hands---&#148; Wendy moaned from her 
spot on the bed, this being the night she stood over for &#147;homework&#148;. 
She promised a &#147;refresher&#148; lesson after she caught her breath, so 
Alicia was looking over the book lists while she waited.

The idea of all these books and the classes they went to -- still, she 
promised she&#146;d get the books so a promise was a promise.

When she got to Flourish and Blotts she thought for an instant the 
books have gone mad and started killing each other. In a huge iron 
cage she saw books trying to murder each other.

&#147;Oh, no.&#148; she sighed wearily, &#147;Not the murdering Monster books again.&#148; 
(sure enough, each list had a request for one copy apiece) &#147;Hagrid 
must have an evil streak in him to assign these books.&#148; she lamented 
as she walked in. As she did, the manager came hurrying to her.

&#147;Hogwarts?&#148; he said abruptly. &#147;Come to get you--&#148;

&#147;Hang on a sec.&#148; she grumbled, shoving her lists into his hands. With 
a tired groan she walked over to the iron cage and stood in front of 
it, whipping her head back and forth to work the kinks out as she 
loosened up. &#147;---miss? What are you---&#148;

With one hand she motioned for the cage to open, with the other she 
waited as the books rushed out all at once. &#147;MISS!! WHAT ARE--&#148;

&#147;Shut up.&#148; she growled, quickly using her free hand to &#147;catch&#148; all the 
books as they rushed her, freezing them in place and bringing them 
upwards into the air. As she focused on them she thought for a second 
&#147;Need a good medium, something to---&#148; (looks down) &#147;---the things I do 
for love---&#148; she groaned. Carefully, she then (with one hand 
levitating the books) ran two of her fingers up and down between her 
breasts (generating a sense similar to how she stroked book&#146;s spine if 
she was working on the book), feeding that same &#147;soft touch&#148; into 
their &#147;minds&#148; (as it were). She then focused harder, tongue licking 
the air as she stimulated the books &#147;minds&#148; the same way she did her 
own book&#146;s spine with her tongue. She then (still stimulating herself 
while focusing those feelings onto the books) triggered a looping 
spell that kept that same pleasure rippling through each book. Finally 
she set them all down on the display and stopped focusing. That did 
it. The books were now completely docile, and would stay that way. All 
she had to do was mend the books and that&#146;s when she realized she was 
doing it without her wand! Feeling like a total idiot for missing such 
a simple &#147;trick&#148; she quickly yanked it out and did that spell with her 
wand, hoping he was too dazed to notice what she was doing before. 
After the books mended themselves, and he seemed too dazed to ask 
about earlier, she told the manager that the books were now docile and 
moved to catch her breath. Of course she TRIED to catch her breath, 
which she didn&#146;t have long to do as the store manager nearly mauled 
her crying out, &#147;GOD BLESS YOU!! GOD BLESS YOU!!&#148; (She nearly died 
from suffocation).

When he finally stopped smothering her he helped her get the books she 
needed for herself, Ron and Hermione. Two copies of the Monster Book 
of Monsters being part of her list of course.

&#147;I&#146;m never stocking those things again!&#148; the manager cried, helping 
Alicia find a book on Arithimancy, &#147;It&#146;s been bedlam (before you 
showed up of course)! I thought we&#146;d seen the worst when we bought two 
hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility -- cost a 
fortune, and we never found them---&#148;

&#147;You got ripped off.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Ripped off.&#148; she noted as she picked up a book on, of all things, 
&#147;Muggle Studies&#148; which she put into her lot. &#147;Those kind of books 
would be sorta like Predators.&#148;

&#147;Say what?&#148; the manager asked, looking confused.

&#147;Predators. Like the movie? With Schwarzenegger, then Danny Glover in 
the sequel?&#148; (waits for a reply) &#147;Don&#146;t you ever get out and see a 
movie? Rent or buy a DVD? Anything?&#148;

&#147;OH!&#148; (looks embarrassed) &#147;But what about it? You mean the books are 
dangerous?&#148;

&#147;I mean you should have received a batch of books which looked like 
clear whispy glass, when you open it the pages become solid. That&#146;s 
how you can tell an invisible object from an empty box which is what 
you probably bought.&#148;

The manager excused himself and made a call, probably to a lawyer, 
coming back seconds later to help her with her books, thanking her 
again of course (this time no hug). &#147;Is there anything else I can help 
you with?&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148; (she looks down her list, having taken care of Hermione&#146;s 
specialty books) &#147;I need three copies of Unfogging the Future by 
Cassandra Vablatsky.&#148;

&#147;Ah, starting Divination, are you?&#148;

&#147;Guess so.&#148; Alicia muttered as she followed him, sighing resentfully 
as she did.

In truth? She really needed a class like Divination like she needed a 
hole in her head. She was already a Raven so she had a talent with 
future sight, but apparently the class was given automatically at Year 
3 so she had no choice but to take it, even if it was probably going 
to bore the heck out of her. He took her to the back of the shop where 
a small table of books set for fortune telling were set.

&#147;Here you go.&#148; said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to 
take down three thick, black-bound books. &#147;Unfogging the Future. Very 
good guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods -- palm-reading, 
crystal balls, bird entrails--&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll give it a shot after dinner tonight. I have a hankering for 
roasted chicken--&#148; (sighs) &#147;--then again maybe I&#146;ll just stick with 
the Hamburger Helper that the cook makes, and tries to pass off as an 
old Transylvanian pasta dish. Eck.&#148; (picks up book lying to one side) 
&#147;What a grim cover. The writer of this book had a lousy future 
indeed.&#148;

The book was uninteresting except for the title. Death Omens: What to 
Do When You Know the Worst Is Coming. (&#145;Should have had a copy before 
I died.&#146; Alicia thought gloomily, &#145;Then again--&#146;)

&#147;Oh, I wouldn&#146;t read that if I were you,&#148; the manager warned her, 
looking at the book in her hand. &#147;You&#146;ll start seeing death omens 
everywhere. It&#146;s enough to frighten anyone to death.&#148;

&#147;Been there, done that.&#148; she whispered, tossing the book aside. &#147;Then 
I&#146;ll just need three copies of Intermediate Transfiguration, three 
copies of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three, any book that&#146;d 
make a good birthday gift for a girl who is really good at magic (Year 
3) and--&#148; (grabs a book off the shelf, rifles through the pages, and 
tossing the book into her pile. &#147;This.&#148;

The manager looks down at it, &#147;But that&#146;s a book a lot of male 
customers have been demanding! It&#146;s nothing but naughty stories and 
moving photos of women having---&#148; (blushes) &#147;---oh.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; she repeated, glaring at him as her fingers brushed the title, 
which simply read &#147;The Beauty of Our Love - Hogsmeades&#145; Witches on 
Witches&#147;. He immediately backed off to find her books, adding &#147;Lots of 
women read it too! You know, because we get a lot of them here. And 
they love that book. Highly recommended. The stories of passion are 
very detailed and beautiful while the pictures are very erotic without 
being perverted or degrading to the women and---&#148;

&#147;Quit while your WAY behind already.&#148; she finally told him, shaking 
her head.

As he rung her up (adding &#147;The Big Book of Little Known Useful Spells 
Vol. 1&#148;) she asked the obvious, &#147;Do any lesbians really shop here?&#148;

&#147;Why not? Though I wouldn&#145;t know which witch is which, it&#145;s not like 
they confide those things to me, they just come here to buy books.&#148; he 
remarks, &#147;I sold quite a few copies of that book to women since it&#146;s 
written by women so it&#146;s nothing--- oh!&#148; (frowns) &#147;Your thinking of 
those blokes. The ignorant ones who--- yeah.&#148; (nods his head) &#147;I saw 
their &#145;work&#146; and heard their &#145;ideas&#146;. Bunch of ignorant thought if you 
ask me. People should be allowed to live and love as they please, not 
having a bunch of slack jawed whiney wand wavers like that with no 
class pester them for it. Bunch of jerks if you ask me.&#148;

&#147;Agreed.&#148; She paid him, and pecked him softly on the cheek for being a 
nice man, then left the shop with her purchases. Still, the thought of 
those &#147;blokes&#148; rubbed into her as she walked.

Still, it lingered as she went back to her room and collapsed into her 
bed. She didn&#146;t want to think about it anymore, about ignorance or how 
racist it was everytime they referred to Muggles, or to -- &#147;I don&#146;t 
care anymore.&#148; she growled, rolling over onto her stomach to bury her 
face in her pillow, &#147;I hate my life.&#148;

&#147;What, dear? I didn&#146;t understand that, you have to speak up.&#148; the 
mirror said with a slight bit of concern, &#147;Your not going to off 
yourself, are you? I remember when the mirror two rooms down nearly 
had a bloke who did that by accident, wouldn&#146;t stop panicking 
everytime somebody looked dead to it and --&#148;

&#145;Is silence worth seven years back luck---&#146; Alicia thought as she 
regarded the mirror briefly.

------

The days passed, and the wait for Hermione was becoming unbearable.

She finally sent, after a few days, her &#147;last&#148; owl saying that she was 
on her way. Still it seemed to be too long. As the days drew closer to 
the trip back to Hogwarts she began to see students from the school 
arriving at Diagon Alley for their school supplies.

The last day before departing was the worst and the best though, in 
her opinion.

The worst of it was being cornered by Oliver Wood at the ice cream 
shoppe and nearly talked to death about Quidditch moves. Of course he 
couldn&#146;t stop going on and on about how she should be more like 
Potter. More like Potter this, more like Potter that, made her want to 
kick Wood in the Little Wood just to shut him up. The worst, however, 
came when Florence came out and remarked on her cute boyfriend (which 
nearly sent her into ballistic mode), but at least Wood got the point 
and left her alone (for now at least).

She met other members of her &#147;house&#148;, but only a handful she knew to 
any degree. In terms of friends she only had a tight woven circle of 
friends, followed by a medium circle of good acquaintances, and then a 
wide circle of people who feared her, or just kept their distance 
because they didn&#146;t like her too much. She wasn&#146;t the darling of the 
school, nor it&#146;s social outcast. She was simply one of them, with her 
own friends and enemies, and basically normal in every sense -- except 
this year. People she never talked to seemed to take note of her, if 
not to speak to her than just to look at her and speak about her 
behind her back. For some reason everyone seemed to note her more, and 
it seemed to go back to what she learned earlier that she was going to 
be abit more noticed in school than before. But how--?

&#145;With my luck somebody&#146;s passing around an illegal sphere of me and 
some loose morals witch making out.&#146; she thought to herself, taking a 
rather low view of her limited &#147;fame&#148; without even knowing with people 
were more intent on looking at her than they were last year.

There was, of course, a few bright spots, one of which being her 
running into the cute couple of Longbottom/Myrial (May to everyone she 
knew). She ran into Neville (the real Neville) and May outside of 
Flourish &amp; Blotts, May (a girl Neville&#146;s height with small pointy 
elfin ears and beautiful blonde hair (from her Amazonian side) flowing 
down her back) gently scolding Neville for losing his booklist. As he 
went in to get their books May took Alicia aside. &#147;I told him, and I 
showed him my true elfin form!&#148; she grinned, flashing a V for Victory 
sign, &#147;And he STILL LOVES ME!! My precious loves me!&#148;

Alicia, confused, thought about what she said for a second before -- 
&#147;OH! You mean you -- you act like a Amazonian the way you prattle on! 
Not like your mutli sexed or any--&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be mean!&#148; she pouted, looking down at her feet as she did, &#147;It 
was sweet of him to still accept me as a lover despite the shock it 
must have been for him.&#148;

&#147;It would have been a worst shock if you pulled your skirt up and 
showing him a thing only Amazonians and certain humanoids have! No 
doubt in my mind, probably would have shocked a few years off his life 
expectancy.&#148; Alicia murmured, only to receive a glaring glance from 
May. May, after all, was extremely sensitive about her elfin body. 
She, when in &#147;true&#147; form, was a tall statuesque young woman with ample 
everything (which Alicia liked to tease her about even if it made May 
majorly pissy).

&#147;You&#145;re supposed to be my &#147;parole&#147; officer, not here to find the 
perfect mate! Anyway, you give him the &#147;grand tour&#147; of your assets 
yet? At least help him lose his virginity sometime soon!&#148;

May&#146;s face drops and turns serious, &#147;My Neville&#146;s a gentleman!&#148; she 
growled, waving an accusing finger at Alicia, &#147;When we&#146;re ready we&#146;ll 
explore our sexualities when it&#146;s time and NOT before. Just because 
your so loose with your legs and your--&#148;

&#147;Alright, alright, give me a break.&#148; Alicia sighed, shaking her off as 
she turned her back over to Neville (who was waving for her from 
inside the bookstore). &#147;Thank god for sweet &#147;little&#148; girls like May 
--&#148; (thinks about it for a second) &#147;-- good thing she still goes 
around in her &#147;second&#147; form though, I don&#145;t think anyone&#145;s ready to 
see Neville with a tall blonde elfin goddess as a girlfriend just yet. 
It&#145;d probably kill Malfoy at first sight.&#148;

There was, of course, other people she met. She ran into her fellow 
Quidditch teammates (who were doing their best to avoid Wood since he 
was on the warpath today), and most of them were found ogling the 
Firebolt. Even her more sensible female teammates were ogling it, 
which was a real surprise to Alicia since she never thought them as 
&#147;broom fanatics&#148;. All and all though? She kept any questions as to why 
they were ogling it to herself.

She, of course, eventually found the people she was really looking 
for. It was outside of the ice cream shoppe she&#146;d been spending her 
days with Potter studying that she finally saw the person she was 
waiting for. Hermione Granger. She was presently talking to Harry and 
Ron (who hadn&#146;t noticed her yet), but she soon heard her opening when 
Harry asked if they got all their supplies yet. &#147;I already got the 
books, as I promised.&#148; she chipped in, sliding into a chair between 
Hermione/Ron as she nodded to each one. &#147;I&#146;ll give them to you once we 
get back to the Leaky Cauldron. Though---&#148; (her face turns serious) 
&#147;---I have to say that your list baffled me the most. I mean the 
amount of books implies a lot of classes! Can you---&#148;

&#147;Well, I AM taking more new subjects than you, aren&#146;t I?&#148; she 
remarked.

&#147;Don&#146;t be all flippant with me on it.&#148; Alicia countered, feeling her 
cheeks grow rosey red from Hermione&#146;s stern expression aimed right at 
her, &#147;You got all the stuff we have, PLUS Arithmancy (whatever that 
is), Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies -- and that I can&#146;t figure 
out because you need Muggle Studies like I need a refresher course in 
Lesbian 10---&#148; (Alicia quickly shut her mouth and went an even 
brighter red that went from face to toes. Hermione, however, either 
didn&#146;t notice or chose to &#147;ignore&#148; it as she picked up the 
conversation where Alicia &#147;dropped&#148; it. &#147;It&#146;ll be fascinating to study 
them from the wizarding point of view,&#148; she said earnestly. &#147;Oh, sure. 
That.&#148; Alicia sputtered, trying to regain her composure, &#147;If you like 
the view from a purely ignorant racist POV then you&#146;re in for a real 
treat with this class. Yes, sir.&#148; (sighs irritably as Ron picks up the 
slack) &#147;Are you planning on surviving on air and sunlight alone 
because there&#146;s no time to do anything else, let alone feed yourself 
or get any sleep, with that schedule.&#148;

Hermione, ignoring him, checked her purse. &#147;Thanks to Alicia&#146;s 
generous help I have quite abit of Galleons left.&#148; she announced, 
checking her purse&#146;s contents. &#147;It&#146;s my birthday in September, and Mum 
and---?&#148;

At this moment Alicia popped the book, wrapped in beautiful gold 
wrapping and tied with a bow, out of a tesseract gem on her uniform 
and quickly shoved it forward towards Hermione squeaking &#147;Happy 
Birthday!&#148; with her face blushing madly, and her eyes shut. She felt a 
cold chill down her spine, and gritted her teeth at her rash action. 
She didn&#146;t even have a chance to prepare, or to do it properly. She 
just wanted to give it the moment she heard it was her birthday coming 
up.

Rash, impulsive, without thinking a thing out. That&#146;s her alright.

Still, Hermione accepted it graciously and looked genuinely happy with 
the gift. She hugged it to her chest and said she&#146;d treasure it. With 
a little bit of the weight lifted from her shoulders she asked 
Hermione what she was going to get herself with her Galleons.

&#147;How about a nice book?&#148; said Ron innocently.

&#147;No, I don&#146;t think so, and Alicia already got me a nice book so -- I 
really want an owl.&#148; (Alicia almost groaned out loud at the decision, 
an OWL, sheesh) &#147;I mean, Harry&#146;s got Hedwig and you&#146;ve got Errol --&#148;

&#147;No I haven&#146;t,&#148; said Ron as a matter of fact. &#147;Errol&#146;s a family owl. 
All I&#146;ve got is Scabbers.&#148; (suddenly he pulls his pet rat out of his 
pocket, &#147;Speaking of which I want to get him checked out.&#148; he added, 
placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. &#147;I don&#146;t think Egypt 
agreed with him.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t blame him.&#148; Alicia whispered, looking carefully at the rat, 
it&#146;s body thinner than usual with a telltale droop in his whiskers 
showing how rather &#147;off&#148; it was in it&#146;s health.

&#147;Did you try out the Magical Menagerie yet?&#148; Alicia offered, motioning 
towards the side of the street opposite of the ice cream palour, 
&#147;Figure they could help you out while Hermione gets her owl.&#148; (she 
took care not to drool out the word &#147;owl&#148; or make it sound like she 
was pissed.)

Noticing Alicia&#146;s foul mood, Hermione smiled, &#147;I&#146;ll get one that&#146;ll 
remind me of you everytime I see it, as a thank you for the lovely 
present.&#148;

This brought Alicia&#146;s frown up to a smile, and brightened her mood.

Even an owl started to sound pretty good as long as it was beautiful 
and noble, because it would always remind Hermione of herself, and 
gave her hope that Hermione was getting the hints that she was 
interested in her.

------

The first thing Alicia noticed when she stepped into the Magical 
Menagerie behind the trio was that it was quite cramp inside. In truth 
there was not much room inside the shop, every inch of the walls being 
hidden behind some form of cage. It was smelly, the noise was 
unbearable, and it took a lot of effort on Alicia&#146;s part to remain 
focused as she walked into this virtual assault on the senses. The 
first face to peer at her from behind the counter didn&#146;t help her any 
either, it was the purple haired witch she &#147;helped&#148; some days ago.

She was already advising a wizard on a sickly (by appearance more than 
by it&#146;s health) looking double-ended newts (with an additional head 
where it&#146;s butt should have been --- whichever end that could have 
possibly been). As she helped him with that, the four waited behind 
the wizard, examining cages.

The entire store did nothing for Alicia whatsoever. In fact, the store 
was beginning to get on her nerves in a general and overall sense.

The pair of enormous purple toads that gulped down the dead blowflies 
made Alicia nauseous.

The gigantic tortoise with it&#146;s jewel-encrusted shell that sat by the 
window, glittering in the sunlight that streamed into Diagon Alley? 
That was just too weird for Alicia&#146;s tastes, too shiny too.

The poisonous orange snails that were oozing slowly up the side of 
their glass tank only served to creep Alicia out majorly.

As for the fat white rabbit that kept changing into a silk top hat and 
back again with a loud popping noise? Alicia was tempted to purchase 
it just so she&#146;d have the unique pleasure of strangling it to death 
with her bare hands.

There were, of course, cats of many different colors and breeds. They 
mostly made Alicia thankful that she didn&#146;t have an allergic reaction 
to cats.

There were her favorite animal, of course, the ravens. But these 
ravens were far too noisy and nowhere as dignified or perfect as her 
Chii was. These ravens? They were just bad mannered.

There was a basketful of odd looking custard-colored furballs that 
were humming a strange song. And, if Alicia didn&#146;t know any better, 
she would have sworn that she was staring at a basketful of Tribbles. 
She didn&#146;t like Tribbles. No sir, she didn&#146;t like them in the least. 
So these things of course turned her off in a major sense from just 
reminding her of Tribbles.

On the counter a vast cage of sleek black rats sat, and they were 
playing a rather odd skipping game with one of the rat&#146;s tails as the 
&#147;rope&#148;.

By the time Alicia finally noticed what was going on, Ron and Harry 
was already up front and the witch was taking care of Scabbers. She 
listened to hear Hermione making her selection, wondering what kind of 
beautiful owl she&#146;d pick.

So lost in her thoughts she barely noticed the gigantic orange thing 
fly from the top of the highest cage, land hard on it&#146;s head (ouch), 
and then leap like a guided missile right at Scabbers.

&#147;NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!&#148; the witch cried out, but almost immediately the 
entire place became a madhouse. Scabbers ran off, Ron and Harry 
scurried to find it, the witch clung onto the strange cat like mad 
trying to hold it down -- and Alicia? She followed Ron/Harry out, 
having decided at the start of the chaos to quickly step back out of 
harm&#146;s way and watch the events unfold without actually becoming an 
active participant in the madness.

It took ten minutes for Ron to find Scabbers. For some reason, no 
matter how hard she tried, Alicia couldn&#146;t get a lock on Scabber&#146;s 
mind. It was as if he was a blank &#147;void&#148; in the middle of this large 
ocean of open minds. Still Ron found him, and that&#146;s what mattered. 
Ron had found him beneath a wastepaper bin outside of Quality Quiddich 
Supplies.

This fact confused Alicia. She had passed that wastepaper bin FIVE 
times, each time scanning it as she passed, yet she felt nothing of 
Scabbers. &#145;Maybe he hid under there just as Ron found him.&#146; she 
thought, brushing off her strange inability to &#147;connect&#148; with Scabbers 
as nothing to become overtly concerned about. As for Ron? He merely 
stuffed the trembling terror filled rat back into his pocket and 
straightened up, massaging his head as he did.

&#147;What was that?&#148;

&#147;Cat, Ron. It was a cat -- or a furry version of a guided missile,&#148; 
Alicia remarked, thinking back on the bizarre creature, and how it 
could respond so quickly after taking a header into the counter and 
smacking itself upside it&#146;s own head. &#147;Take your pick. I&#146;m personally 
swaying towards &#147;guided missile&#148; myself, but that&#146;s just me.&#148;

&#147;Where&#146;s Hermione?&#148; Ron asked, to which Harry replied &#147;Probably 
getting her owl--&#148; before his voice fell away into a dead sort of 
silence. It seemed that, at that moment, he saw Hermione and saw her 
&#147;animal&#148;, and that is what fell him so quickly into a stunned silence.

It was Hermione alright, but she wasn&#146;t holding an owl as she exited 
the Magical Menagerie. Far from it. Her arms was, instead, clamped 
tightly around the self-same enormous ginger cat that tried to turn 
Scabbers into a mid-day snack.

Alicia&#146;s heart sank at the sight of the monstrous thing that passed 
for a cat, and felt rather dejected by Hermione&#146;s choice.

&#147;You bought that monster?&#148; Ron sputtered, his mouth sputtering as he 
stared at it in confusion.

&#147;He&#146;s gorgeous, isn&#146;t he?&#148; she went on, blathering about the thing as 
if it was the most beautiful thing in the whole wide world. But to 
Alicia? It only added insult to injury that the thing was not only a 
monstrously disgusting creature, that it also had to be a &#147;he&#148; as 
well. That just seemed to push all her buttons, yet she still managed 
to keep a slightly disturbing &#147;smile&#148; on her face.

The cat&#146;s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but the creature the fur 
was attached to was rather bowlegged and it&#146;s face looked grumpy and 
oddly squashed (most likely from it&#146;s habit of &#147;table diving&#148; which 
often resulted in it landing face first into the countertop). Anyway 
as long as Scabbers remained hidden the cat seemed quite content to 
purr contentedly in Hermione&#146;s arms.

Still, the implications of Hermione&#146;s &#147;promise&#148;, and the thing she 
brought out with her, only dug deeply into Alicia&#146;s tender feelings 
like a red hot knife through exposed flesh. In fact she was so put out 
by this that she ignored their talking all the way back to the Leaky 
Cauldron, pouting miserably (though keeping her &#147;smile&#148; on her face).

They found Mr. Weasley inside, sitting in the bar reading the Daily 
Prophet.

&#147;Harry! Alicia!&#148; he said, smiling as he looked up. &#147;How are you two?&#148;

&#147;Fine, thanks,&#148; said Harry, to which Alicia merely nodded her head and 
said a quick greeting, as they all joined Mr. Weasley at the table 
with all their shoppings in hand. As they all sat down Mr. Weasley put 
down his paper, which Alicia looked at briefly noting the now familiar 
picture of Sirius Black staring up at them.

&#147;They still haven&#146;t caught him, then?&#148; Harry asked.

&#147;No,&#148; Mr. Weasley confirmed, looking rather grave as he spoke, 
&#147;They&#146;ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and 
find him, but no luck so far.&#148;

&#147;Would we get a reward if we caught him?&#148; asked Ron, which nearly 
shocked the hell out of Alicia as he did, &#147;It&#146;d be good to get 
some---&#148;

She hit him upside his head and snarled, &#147;ARE YOU MAD?&#148; she hissed, 
viciously tapping two fingers down on the picture of Sirius as she 
spoke in her harsh tone, &#147;This guy is a certified whack-job and 
killer! The only thing you&#146;ll catch is your death if you messed with 
him.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s right,&#148; Mr. Weasley added, his face looking rather strained at 
Alicia&#146;s outburst. &#147;Black&#146;s not going to be caught by a 13-year-old 
wizard. Mark my words, it&#146;s the Azkaban guards who&#146;ll get him back.&#148;

The mention of Azkaban brought briefly back memories of the place to 
Alicia.

She had seen it only once, but it was enough for her.

The place was dismal. Not horrific like a bad cult horror movie, but 
disturbing in a clean, antiseptic nightmare hospital way. The walls, 
floors, everything was bathed in a sickly green light, and everything 
was far too clean. It was so clean that Alicia almost felt that she 
could eat off the floor and not worry about becoming ill or anything.

Each &#147;cell&#148; was sealed off with a glass &#147;door&#148; which allowed 
unrestricted visuals into the cell, which held one person each who 
looked like they had the life sucked out of them and the prison was 
only being used to hold their lifeless husks. Each one was a 
disturbing vistage of madness, laid out on their bed staring 
listlessly into space. One cell, however, caught Alicia&#146;s attention 
the most. It was housing two, not one. The two, who were husband and 
wife, laid in their bed naked and seemed to be quite sexually active 
most of the time. It seemed the only thing they did all day was eat, 
sleep and have sex. Their eyes were as disturbing as everyone else&#146;s, 
and their &#147;enthusiasm&#148; for sex was scary by the human guards term of 
the word &#147;scary&#148; because nobody bothered to watch. They all kept their 
distance. Even the &#147;Dementors&#148; kept their distance, preferring the 
quieter prisoners to these two who did everything with great and 
frightening energy. That&#146;s why she did what she did, when she---

Her memories stopped as Mrs. Weasley entered, laden with shopping bags 
followed by the &#147;Terrible Twins&#148; of Fred &amp; George.

Now it was no great secret that Alicia didn&#146;t like Fred &amp; George very 
much, but they seemed to have a strange fascination towards her. A 
fascination that seemingly bordered on the illegal, the way they 
seemed to fixated on her at times. The only thing Alicia knew of their 
fascination with her was that she didn&#146;t want any part of it, period. 
And that&#146;s all she ever wanted to know about their &#147;liking&#148; for her.

Right behind those three was Percy, then Ginny (the youngest and only 
girl of the family).

Ginny, who had a major crush on Harry, seemed even more embarrassed 
than usual when she saw him, having no doubt remembered how he was her 
&#147;Knight in Shining Armor&#148; when he saved her from the temporarily 
&#147;resurrected&#148; &#147;dupe&#148; of &#147;Lord Voldemort&#148;. She went quite red (even 
redder than Alicia was earlier when she slipped up outside of the ice 
cream palour) and muttered a quick &#147;hello&#148; without looking at Harry. 
Young &#147;love&#148;. Alicia couldn&#146;t help but smile inwardly though she still 
felt rather moody on the outside. A condition which only worsened when 
Percy stepped forward.

Percy, for his part of the situation, was rather disturbing towards 
Harry (and in a sense to Alicia as well) as a counterbalance to 
Ginny&#146;s full body blush girl-ish embarrassment as he held out his hand 
solemnly to Harry as if it was the first time they met. &#147;Harry. How 
nice to see you.&#148;

&#147;Hello, Percy.&#148; said Harry, trying not to laugh as they shook hands.

Next, he turned to Alicia and repeated the process, &#147;Alicia. Pleasure 
to meet---&#148;

&#147;Cut the crap, Perce.&#148; Alicia muttered, battering his hand aside as 
her mood soured even worst than it was a minute ago. &#147;Really not in 
the mood.&#148;

Of course George &amp; Fred simply had to get into the act, bumping Percy 
aside as they &#147;assaulted&#148; Harry. &#147;Harry!&#148; Fred started, bowing deeply, 
&#147;Simply splendid to see you, old boy---&#148;

&#147;Marvelous,&#148; George added, bumping Fred aside in turn and seizing 
Harry&#146;s hand quickly. &#147;Absolutely spiffing.&#148;

Percy scowled, and so did Alicia.

&#147;That&#146;s enough, now.&#148; said Mrs. Weasley firmly, only to have herself 
set upon by the two. &#147;Mum!&#148; said Fred as though he&#146;d only just spotted 
her, seizing her hand as he did. &#147;How really corking to see you---&#148;

&#147;CUT IT OUT!!&#148; Alicia finally yelled, her eyes starting into their 
&#147;burn&#148; cycle, the whites of the eyes slowly glowing. &#147;I said that&#146;s 
ENOUGH,&#148; Mrs. Weasley firmly repeated as she put her shopping bags 
down into an empty chair, reaching a hand out to Alicia, touching her 
shoulder softly. &#147;You alright?&#148;

It took a few seconds, but she simmered down, calming herself to the 
point she could talk without growling every word. &#147;I&#146;m fine.&#148; she 
sighed, smiling abit as she beheld Mrs. Weasley in her eyes. It never 
failed. Just being near Mrs. Weasley always made Alicia feel abit 
better about the world, and her mood lightened abit in her presence. 
She turned towards Harry, smiling, and greeted him. The buzz was all 
about Percy&#146;s new rank as Head Boy, but Alicia wasn&#146;t listening.

Her mind was wandering aimlessly. She felt something in the back of 
her head and smiled.

Cho Chang was nearby now. She could &#147;feel&#148; her presence faintly in the 
back of her mind.

She told Alicia once that she always came here a day early and stood 
with relatives in London before taking the train, so that she was 
always on the Hogwarts Express before everyone else.

She had been anticipating this &#147;feeling&#148; ever since she started 
&#147;looking out&#148; for Cho a few days ago. It took the sound of Ginny&#146;s 
giggling to bring her back to the real world.

&#147;You want to set a better example for your sister!&#148; snapped Mrs. 
Weasley, to which Percy replied &#147;Ginny&#146;s got other brothers to set her 
an example, Mother, I&#146;m going to change for dinner---&#148;

Good examples, at this remark Alicia began to laugh. Low at first, 
then it started to grow. Percy, staring at Alicia oddly as if she just 
snapped, simply turned and went upstairs. George heaved a sigh. &#147;We 
tried to shut him in a pyramid,&#148; he told Harry, &#147;But Mum spotted us.&#148;.
