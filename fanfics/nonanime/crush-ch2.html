<h1>Birds of Prey & The Question: Crush (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/crush-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Barbara Gordon felt a certain degree of amusement at their situation as 
she rolled along beside former police officer Renee Montoya. The redhead 
had only hours ago been directing a meeting between her agents and the 
new Question and now here they both were, walking along together in 
their alternate identities.

&#39;Does she know who I really am?&#39; Barbara wondered as she casually pushed 
her wheelchair down the street.

Barbara was very certain that her secret identity as Oracle was quite 
secure, but it wasn&#39;t impossible for a good enough detective to deduce 
it. And Renee Montoya was just such a good detective, having solved 
major cases under Commissioner Gordon as well as operating under her 
guise of the Question. She was of course well aware of who Renee was, 
having discovered it by spotting her changing in view of one of the 
city&#39;s security cameras.

&quot;Do you have any preferences for coffee?&quot; Rene asked Barbara politely, 
her brown hair falling into her eyes. It gave her a slightly innocent 
look, something that was oddly in conflict with her usual tough girl 
act.

&quot;Just as long as it&#39;s not one of the chain stores,&quot; Barbara said to her 
honestly, making a disgusted face.

&quot;Not a fan of coffee drones?&quot; Renee asked curiously as they passed one 
of several StarBlendz in the area.

&quot;That and I hate how they choke out every other kind of coffee shop,&quot; 
Barbara shrugged, &quot;I&#39;d rather support a local.&quot;

They ended up at a corner coffee shop reasonably filled with people, the 
scent of freshly made coffee wafting out onto the street. Decorated in a 
older style it had wooden counters and tables with glossy tops, a few 
cloth napkins added for color. Renee pushed and shoved her way through 
the mob to the counter while Barbara found them a seat, using her wheels 
to occasionally get someone out of her way.

&quot;Corner table,&quot; Renee noted admiringly as she walked over carrying a 
plastic tray loaded with their orders, &quot;not bad.&quot;

Barbara smiled slightly as she tapped the arm rest of her wheelchair, &quot;I 
have a advantage, when I choose to use it.&quot;

&quot;That reminds me,&quot; Renee said as she set the coffee cups and various 
additives down, &quot;I had a question I wanted to ask you.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Barbara asked her warily, wondering if a clueless question about 
her wheelchair status was coming. She prepared her cup of coffee while 
she waited for the other shoe to drop, metaphorically speaking.

&quot;What&#39;s it like living in Metropolis?&quot; Renee asked curiously while 
making her coffee, &quot;The Commish mentioned it, but....&quot;

Barbara felt herself smiling as she mused, &quot;It&#39;s a very new, very clean 
city. You don&#39;t have the dark alley&#39;s we have here, it&#39;s all very 
brightly lit and open for business.&quot;

&quot;So no Crime Alley?&quot; Renee guessed.

&quot;The closest they have is Suicide Slum,&quot; Barbara nodded, &quot;and I agree 
it&#39;s bad but... it still doesn&#39;t come close to parts of Gotham.&quot;

Noting Barbara&#39;s tone of voice Renee asked, &quot;Do you miss Gotham?&quot;

Barbara had to take a moment to think about that one, sipping her 
coffee. &quot;Not exactly,&quot; she answered honestly, &quot;it&#39;s just... I knew 
Gotham City like the back of my hand. Even after the earthquake and the 
rest of the damage and rebuilding, it was all familiar to me.&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Renee nodded eagerly, &quot;it got to the point where 
I could walk my old patrol route blindfolded.&quot;

&quot;But I haven&#39;t developed quite the same degree of familiarity with 
Metropolis yet,&quot; Barbara admitted ruefully..

Renee drank some coffee then put it down as she observed, &quot;And I guess 
the criminal types are different there, too.&quot;

&quot;That actually doesn&#39;t effect normal folks too much,&quot; Barbara admitted. 
&quot;If there&#39;s anything Superman is actually better at than Batman, it&#39;s 
protecting people from the villains in the city,&quot; she said reluctantly.

&quot;Batman&#39;s only human,&quot; Renee reflected, &quot;even if he tries hard to 
convince us otherwise.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve met him, of course,&quot; Barbara said thoughtfully.

&quot;During No Man&#39;s Land,&quot; Renee nodded, &quot;a few times before and after, 
too.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;I think my run ins with Two Face scared me more 
than meeting him.&quot;

&quot;It must have been hard,&quot; Barbara agreed, knowing the details of that 
little story.

Harvey Dent had developed an obsession with Renee, even investigating 
her life. In the process he discovered she was a lesbian, and was drawn 
to her even more by their both having secret sides. He attempted to 
frame her for murder, out her at work and then destroy her civilian 
life, all to compel her to stay with Harvey. In the end Renee fought 
free, but her forced outing had changed her life forever.

&quot;It was hard,&quot; Renee agreed somberly, &quot;but in the end I think it turned 
out for the best.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Barbara looked surprised.

Sipping a bit more coffee Renee mused, &quot;As long as I was in the closet, 
it was always something that could be used against me.&quot; She sighed, &quot;Now 
I&#39;m free of that fear, and no matter what it&#39;s cost me I think it&#39;s 
worth it.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Barbara murmured, remembering the moment she had revealed her 
own secret to her father. It had been frightening but also very 
liberating for her, too.

Renee finished off her coffee, putting the cup down with a sigh. &quot;So,&quot; 
she asked curiously, &quot;what would you like to do?&quot;

&quot;How about we just take a walk?&quot; Barbara offered as she drank down the 
last of her own cup. &quot;It&#39;s actually a nice day....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Renee agreed as she got up, stretching gracefully.

Barbara felt a odd flush as she watched the slim woman move, taking in 
the graceful lines of her body. She wasn&#39;t pretty, exactly, but Renee 
had a athletic energy that was quite striking, along with her almost 
boyish looks. &#39;She&#39;s very attractive, really,&#39; Barbara admitted to 
herself as they left the caf&eacute; together.

Gotham could be a beautiful city, even in the usual depths of danger and 
corruption. The city street was busy with men and women going about 
their day&#39;s jobs, all probably unaware of the danger they were in. 
Reading confidential reports Barbara knew exactly how many Arkham 
inmates were escaped and how many criminals were in town, but the people 
carried on as usual. But the sun was shining brightly and the air was 
cleaner than usual, both of which gave them all a spring to their step.

Barbara hid a smile as Renee moved so that she was on the outside of the 
sidewalk, unconsciously shielding Barbara. It used to bother her a bit, 
but eventually Barbara accepted that it was a instinctive thing in some 
people and that she should just accept it. From the corner of her eye 
she caught a flash of gold, seeing a familiar figure in a black and red 
costume and gold lined cape racing across the rooftops.

&quot;Robin,&quot; Renee had seen the same thing, her lips lifting a bit in a 
smile. &quot;I met him a few times on the job,&quot; she noted, &quot;he&#39;s a good kid.&quot;

&quot;Met many heroes?&quot; Barbara asked curiously.

&quot;Most of the local capes,&quot; Renee admitted, &quot;once I became a detective I 
had to work with them on some cases. And of course I met a few out of 
towner types, when our cases lead to crooks not local to Gotham.&quot;

&quot;Did you have a favorite?&quot; Barbara had to ask, a impish smile tugging at 
her lips.

Renee chuckled softly. &quot;Honestly?&quot; she asked, looking sheepish. &quot;I met 
the redheaded Batgirl back when I was just starting out,&quot; she admitted, 
&quot;she made quite a impression on me.&quot;

Barbara felt a odd warmth as she fought down a blush. &quot;What happened?&quot; 
she asked.

As Renee described her encounter with Batgirl as a new recruit Barbara&#39;s 
own photographic memory dug up the details. It was a blessing and a 
curse having such a memory, but in times like this she really 
appreciated it.

&#39;It was her and Harvey Bullock,&#39; Barbara remembered. Renee had seemed 
younger than Barbara then, a nervous beat cop, even though they were 
actually about the same age. More than once she had believed she was 
older than her years, and the crazy experiences Barbara had experienced 
in costume hadn&#39;t helped. The costume gave her a edge back then, hiding 
most of her face and letting her observe the nervous woman easily. &#39;She 
was cute back then, too,&#39; Barbara admitted.

&quot;I had such a crush on her back then,&quot; Renee laughed softly, &quot;I even 
bought one of the posters they were making.&quot;

&quot;Posters?&quot; Barbara asked, surprised.

Renee blushed, &quot;Someone hired a actress and had her dress up in a 
Batgirl uniform. The poses weren&#39;t too bad, but they were kinda 
naughty.&quot;

&quot;Oh lord,&quot; Barbara blushed, trying not to imagine what those must have 
been like. &#39;I bet Bruce shut the poster guy down before I heard about 
it,&#39; she thought ruefully, &#39;it&#39;s the sort of thing he&#39;d do.&#39;

&quot;Yeah, it was kinda stupid,&quot; Renee agreed, &quot;they didn&#39;t even get someone 
with the right color eyes.&quot; She looked at Barbara a moment and smiled, 
&quot;Batgirl had green eyes like yours.&quot;
