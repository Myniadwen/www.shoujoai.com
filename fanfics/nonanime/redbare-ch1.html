Night. It was a little cold for wearing the dress; my knees felt stiff 
whenever I stood still for a minute, but I did not regret picking it 
over my other clothes. They were all rags. I wondered where exactly he 
had found such a nice dress. It was brand new although there were no 
markings from any shop. It had a neat smell.

I didn&#39;t have any scent of my own. The shampoo he gave me was scentless 
and there was no perfume either. No, this uniform was lovely. The shoes 
too were new and shiny. I could conquer the entire world with this. If 
he&#39;d let me.

He hadn&#39;t told me his name, but I figured it wasn&#39;t important. Someone 
else had sent him and I wasn&#39;t supposed to know too much.

It was a few hours ago he had awoken me. Awoken me from an endless 
nightmare. I promised him I&#39;d do anything. I swore my trust and he 
smiled. A heart warming smile. Then he told me what to do.

It wasn&#39;t hard. My job was to wait by the road and take care of the girl 
no matter what. Take care of her. He touched me as he said it. His hand 
on my shoulder made me feel light as a feather. I promised to look after 
her. No matter what.

I let out my hair and tied it up again. I straightened the skirt and 
pulled up my socks. There weren&#39;t any mirrors around. I really wanted to 
see myself again. He had only let me catch a glimpse in the bucket of 
water he carried along.

My hands looked way older, but I didn&#39;t know about my face. My chest had 
grown older too and my legs were longer. My hair felt just the same and 
it was still brown. I just wanted to see my face. I had to know if I was 
still ugly. I had forgotten to ask him.

There was something shiny in the asphalt. I hadn&#39;t noticed it before. It 
was like it was shining on its own. The darkness wasn&#39;t complete, but 
there were no light sources around to make it shine.

No, this was something special. This was laid out for me to find. But 
why hadn&#39;t he told me before? He had had so much time. More than enough 
to tell me all the other things. Was this a message? A change of plans?

I took a few steps toward it. My jet black shoes provided a beat in a 
night that was otherwise soundless. Oh how I missed music. I wasn&#39;t 
allowed to hear it then, but I was at the radio shop ever so often when 
the people at school...

Anyway, I would go to the store just to listen to music. The shop 
assistant liked me, I think. She would always pick something new for me 
to hear. Until mommy found out.

I bend over and reached out. The light fainted and there was nothing 
there but cold road. Disappointed and with a feeling of being cheated, I 
turned around and walked back.

The stripes on the road suddenly lit up. I turned and looked into a 
blinding light. Something was humming. It was a car. I was trapped in 
the headlight. The brakes screeched. It wasn&#39;t enough. Evading.

The light turned away from my eyes and I could see the car. Just as I 
was about to move I felt locked in place. It wasn&#39;t adrenaline. I felt a 
completely different rush. It wrapped itself around my heart and started 
pumping it faster. I saw her.

There was a girl on the passenger seat. Not just any girl. It was her. 
He hasn&#39;t told me how she looked, but I was sure she was the right one. 
I could feel it.

It was too late. I raised my arms and closed my eyes. The howling tires 
blew away all other sounds. I felt a gust on my bare knees. It was icy. 
The screeching disappeared and I heard the car crash somewhere behind.

I opened my eyes. I was alone on the road. The girl was gone. I had lost 
her now, it wasn&#39;t too late. I had promised. I spun around and ran to 
her rescue.
