<h1>Slayer and Shadow (part 20 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>In most towns the busiest time is during the day, when
workers rush to their jobs, students hurry to school
and the streets are packed with life. In the Hellmouth
cursed city of Sunnydale, however, the darkest period
of night was filled with an unholy sort of life, the
creatures outside of humanity teeming on the darkened
streets.

&quot;Shit,&quot; the vampire cursed, his long brown hair
falling into his eyes as they tried to bolt. There was
a sense of great age about him, even with his youthful
beauty, and a sinister aspect shimmered in his eyes.
He looked like a killer, someone so drenched in blood
that he no longer cared at all.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to keep ahead of them, Scott,&quot; the woman
said a bit breathlessly as the two raced through the
darkness.

&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to be able to manage that,
Claire,&quot; Scott said as they smoothly went up and over
the chainlink fence in just two bounds.

Claire smiled back at him grimly, her short black hair
falling into her eyes as she grabbed a nearby trash
can, tossing it back towards their hunters with
incredible force. She hadn&#39;t died all that long ago,
and so still looked just like your typical teenager,
not a monster, as long as you didn&#39;t notice the occult
aura. &quot;How did they...?&quot; she growled.

Striding after them with a kind of relentless focus
around them was the slayer and her shadowy vampire
ally, both eerily beautiful in the dim light of the
few streetlamps. &quot;You might as well stop running,&quot;
Buffy yelled, her dirty blonde hair falling into
intense eyes.

&quot;All you&#39;re doing is delaying the inevitable,&quot; Willow
agreed, the reddish-brown haired woman keeping up with
ease, her smile showing a bit of fang.

Buffy smiled grimly as she called out to them, &quot;Do you
really think I was going to let you get away with
trying to blow us up? I saw you in that mob, and now
we want answers.&quot;

Scott raced around a corner, waiting a moment for
Claire then they ran on. &quot;Do you think we can get
away?&quot; he asked urgently.

&quot;We have to try,&quot; Claire said softly, &quot;we must warn
the mistresses that the Slayer and the abomination
still live.&quot;

Scott reached out to her, &quot;Stop a moment.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Claire looked over at him impatiently, well
aware they only had a small lead.. only to be felled
with a single powerful blow to the head.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Claire could hear Scott talking almost
like it was far off in the distance, &quot;but one of us
has a better chance of fleeing them than two. Good
luck.&quot; With that he was gone, racing off out of her
line of sight.

&quot;Son of a bi...&quot; Claire slurred as she tried to pull
herself up, then feeling her hope entirely fade as the
slayer found her.

&quot;They always betray one another,&quot; Buffy noted wryly as
the tough young woman yanked Claire to her feet, &quot;it&#39;s
so predictable.&quot;

&quot;It relates to the demon side, I think,&quot; Willow said
dryly. Seeing the impotent fury flickering in Claire&#39;s
eyes she smiled slightly, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, he won&#39;t get
too far.&quot;

Scott ran feeling a surge of joy when he saw the
Slayer and her vampire pet lingering over Claire. The
faintest twinge of guilt nudged at him but he ignored
it, determined to just save himself. As fast as he
could he turned onto another street only to hit what
felt like a wall with immense force.

Faith grinned ferally, her long black hair shimmering
under the street lamp. &quot;Looks like B saved me
something,&quot; she purred, hefting her stake.

&quot;Don&#39;t, please,&quot; Scott tried to shuffle away, &quot;I can
tell you things! Just let me live.&quot;

&quot;G-man?&quot; Faith looked over at the older man curiously,
her voice dripping with a deadly sort of eagerness.

Giles kept a careful distance, his glasses gleaming as
he smiled grimly. &quot;Talk quickly,&quot; he said, &quot;I can&#39;t
restrain her easily, but I will keep her from killing
you if you tell us all you know.&quot;

With that he practically babbled, spilling everything
he knew about the two vampires that had so suddenly
taken over the area. &quot;Well, well,&quot; Faith murmured, her
eyes faintly disturbed as she yanked Scott to his
feet.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Giles asked politely.

&quot;He says Drusilla and Amy are running things,&quot; Faith
said grimly, &quot;Tara&#39;s lover was named Amy... and she
was killed by a vampire a while back.&quot;

&quot;Disturbing,&quot; Giles said as he took a stake from Faith
and hefted it knowingly.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Scott squawked as Giles neared, &quot;you said you
weren&#39;t going to hurt me!&quot;

&quot;I said Faith wasn&#39;t going to hurt you,&quot; Giles struck
smoothly, &quot;not I.&quot; The vampire&#39;s outraged expression
lingered a moment, then he crumbled to dust.

&quot;Not bad, G-man,&quot; Faith said as they walked towards
where they figured Buffy and Willow would be, &quot;I
didn&#39;t know you had it in you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Giles said dryly, &quot;I think.&quot;

&quot;No prob,&quot; Faith smirked.

As they neared they could hear Buffy quizzing the
female vampire, playing bad cop to Willow&#39;s good one.
&quot;Just tell me where they are or I&#39;ll...&quot; Buffy growled
threateningly.

Willow gave Claire a sympathetic look as she tugged
Buffy back, almost as if they were both just vampires
caught up in events outside of their control. &quot;If you
help I might be able to slip you away,&quot; she offered,
&quot;save you from the Slayer.&quot;

&quot;Good news guys,&quot; Faith called as they neared, &quot;the
other vamp sang like a bird.. we know the local vamps
are being led by two female vamps named Drusilla and
Amy.&quot;

&quot;That little weasel,&quot; Claire breathed out, eyes
glowing blood red a moment.

Buffy hefted her stake with deadly intent as she
purred, &quot;Does that mean we don&#39;t need this one any
more?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s likely the information on the vampiresses will
be available through the Watcher&#39;s council,&quot; Giles
conceded, &quot;we don&#39;t need her for that.&quot;

&quot;Last chance,&quot; Willow said gently to Claire, &quot;give me
something good I can use to save you.&quot;

Claire looked up at her, her expression momentarily
indecisive, then decided to try to save her own life.
&quot;The Mistresses... are in a cavern beneath the high
school,&quot; she revealed.

Giles looked shocked, &quot;There is a vampire warren so
close?&quot;

Claire nodded, &quot;Once it belonged to the Master, then
it stood empty until his death. Only the most powerful
vampires will dare claim it.&quot;

&quot;How do we get in?&quot; Faith asked eagerly.

&quot;Tunnels connect it to the sewers, but they are well
guarded,&quot; Claire said with a defeated air, &quot;you will
be destroyed if you attack.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I think we&#39;ll figure out a way,&quot; Buffy exchanged
a grin with Willow.

&quot;The mistresses will destroy you,&quot; Claire burst out,
&quot;Drusilla has unearthly gifts of vision, and despite
her youth Amy commands powers of magic!&quot;

&quot;Magic?&quot; Faith asked, dropping her voice.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t there myself,&quot; Claire conceded, &quot;but I&#39;ve
heard how Amy made Dru&#39;s last lover bust into flames
when Spike grew jealous of the two of them.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a challenge,&quot; Willow murmured.

&quot;You&#39;re both fools... you&#39;re already as good as dead,
you just don&#39;t know it yet,&quot; Claire said softly, eyes
burning with hatred.

Faith met Buffy&#39;s eyes in silent agreement then she
said, &quot;I think we&#39;re done.&quot; Swiftly Faith hauled
Claire up then struck with a wooden stake, driving it
home and turning the stunned vampire into a swirling
cloud of dust.

Without a word the group headed out, staying close
together and ready to strike. &quot;I&#39;ll messenger the
Watchers about any details on Drusilla,&quot; Giles said
briskly.

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Buffy nodded, &quot;do we know anything
about this Amy?&quot;

&quot;According to her Amy is a young or newly made
vampire,&quot; Giles noted as they passed the bronze and
headed towards the school.

&quot;Which doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s going to be a pushover,&quot;
Faith added.

&quot;You&#39;re being all moody suddenly,&quot; Buffy looked at her
lover worriedly.

&quot;Just wondering if one of my past sins has finally
come back to haunt me,&quot; Willow shrugged a bit
uncomfortably.

&quot;Huh?&quot; all three looked at her in surprise then
growing awareness.

&quot;Shortly after I was turned by the Master I attacked
the coven, killing and infecting many,&quot; Willow said
flatly. &quot;One of my victims was a witch named Amy,&quot; she
looked haunted, &quot;who was particularly gifted in using
fire.&quot;

&quot;The name could be a coincidence,&quot; Buffy offered
tentatively.

&quot;Probably isn&#39;t, though,&quot; Faith said softly. She
winced, &quot;I wish I didn&#39;t have to tell Tara...&quot;

&quot;I could,&quot; Giles volunteered uncomfortably.

&quot;Thanks, G-man, but I&#39;d better,&quot; Faith sighed. &quot;Though
I have no idea how to tell my girlfriend that her dead
former girlfriend is maybe now the head of the city&#39;s
vamps.&quot;</pre>
