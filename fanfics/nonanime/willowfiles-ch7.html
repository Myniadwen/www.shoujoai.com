<a href="../nonanime/willowfiles-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Alexandar Tomassi blinked as he heard Olivia&#39;s report
on the special operations team&#39;s kidnaping of Willow
Rosenberg, his face darkening with barely controlled
anger. &quot;Well,&quot; he snarled, &quot;that was a grade a cockup.
Did you reprimand them?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Olivia nodded as the dusky skinned woman
continued &quot;we confirmed Willow&#39;s story through two
sources, and I&#39;ve docked the men&#39;s pay.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re lucky Rosenberg didn&#39;t just tell us off and
leave,&quot; Alex admitted thoughtfully. &quot;Any idea why she
didn&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;Curiosity, partially,&quot; Olivia said. &quot;And I think she
understands the importance of the Slayers... if not
necessarily supporting the Watchers,&quot; she smiled
faintly.

&quot;She was with Rupert when he told the Council off,
wasn&#39;t she?&quot; Alex smiled with honest amusement.

&quot;And she&#39;s very loyal to Giles,&quot; Olivia cautioned.

&quot;I don&#39;t plan to put her in a conflict of loyalties,&quot;
Alex said dryly.

Olivia paused, reaching up and touching the earpiece
she usually wore in the Watcher&#39;s headquarters. &quot;We&#39;ve
gotten another information request from our LA agent,
may I...?&quot; she asked her superior politely.

&quot;Go ahead, the work must always go first,&quot; Alex
nodded.

Olivia left her superior and headed to the command
deck, a room that was buzzing with the whir of
computers and communications, almost like a NASA
facility monitoring a space launch. &#39;Of course here
the computers are drawing on occult data, not star
maps and weather data,&#39; she silently mused.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Joe Dawson turned as he heard her enter, the
casually dressed grey haired American leaning on his
cane, &quot;it looks like Wolfram and Hart are screwing
around with dimensional gates again. Several Slayers
in the field there want to intervene before anything
nasty gets through.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s your call?&quot; Olivia asked as she took her seat.

&quot;They&#39;re all kids,&quot; Joe said wryly, &quot;but Angel and his
crew are there, too. A joint assault might be wise.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Olivia said, &quot;do it.&quot;

&quot;Plan A is a go,&quot; Joe said into his radio, &quot;but report
back if anything goes wrong. We&#39;ll also try to reroute
support there as needed.&quot;

Over the next half hour Olivia coolly dealt with
several information requests as well as coordinating
Slayer activities, moving people like pieces on a
chessboard. Turning from the main screen with a sigh
she saw Lydia Chalmers lurking in the doorway and
waved the woman in.

&quot;Ms. Rosenberg is on the roof, preparing her
protective spell,&quot; Lydia reported, &quot;she wanted to warn
you there may be some interference with our systems.&quot;

&quot;Should we shut down?&quot; Olivia wondered.

&quot;No,&quot; Lydia pushed up her glasses, &quot;but Willow advised
making sure all our surge protectors are working.&quot;

Olivia chuckled to herself as she called in the tech
crews to go over their gear. &quot;I sometimes forget she
was a computer nerd before becoming a witch,&quot; she
admitted.

A few minutes later the lights flickered a moment,
then steadied before Willow tiredly entered the
command center. &quot;It&#39;s done,&quot; the reddish brown haired
woman reported, &quot;I&#39;ve layered on added shields and
wards to the castle.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Lydia asked, hurrying over to
Willow&#39;s side.

&#39;Well isn&#39;t that cute?&#39; Olivia hid a smile.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Willow reassured the older woman with a
smile, &quot;just tired.&quot; Turning to Olivia she added,
&quot;While my additions should help, you really need to
make sure you have in house help to maintain them.&quot;

&quot;We have good staff,&quot; Olivia said firmly, &quot;it
shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&quot;

Willow looked faintly skeptical as she asked, &quot;Then
why did you have to call me to help in the first
place?&quot;

Olivia winced, &quot;Point.&quot;

Lydia gave Olivia a &#39;I told you so&#39; look as she said,
&quot;We&#39;ll do our best, Miss Rosenberg.&quot;

Olivia smiled faintly, &quot;It&#39;s late, and I&#39;m sure you
haven&#39;t eaten. Would you care for some dinner,
Willow?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Willow smiled back.

&quot;Lydia, escort Willow to our cafeteria,&quot; Olivia said
as she saw Lydia blush faintly, &quot;and make arrangements
for a room too.&quot;

&quot;I could always find a inn at the city nearby...&quot;
Willow offered mildly.

&quot;The only one there is a dump,&quot; Olivia reassured her,
&quot;trust me, I know.&quot;

Lydia smiled as she touched Willow&#39;s arm, &quot;And our
cafeteria is at least as good as any restaurant in
town. If not better, frankly.&quot;

Willow smiled finally, &quot;All right, lead on.&quot;

Lydia lead them through busy corridors of the
facility, receiving friendly glances as well as
curious looks towards Willow. Quietly Lydia said,
&quot;Don&#39;t be offended, please. We&#39;re a very tightly knit
group, so anyone new draws interest.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Willow agreed.

Mentally Willow found herself making notes of the
castle and scenery around them, too. She was nearly
finished a novella at home, and it occurred to her a
gothic romance might be a idea for her next work. A
remote castle, a mysterious lady of the house and
possible romance might be fun to write...

&quot;You have the oddest look on your face,&quot; Lydia noted
as they reached a large set of doors.

&quot;Just plotting,&quot; Willow admitted.

Lydia laughed as they entered the cafeteria, which
more resembled a classy restaurant without the
annoying wait staff. &quot;Your books?&quot; she guessed as she
lead the way to the counter.

&quot;You know about...?&quot; Willow blushed.

&quot;We do keep extensive files on important individuals,&quot;
Lydia smiled. &quot;If it helps any, I eagerly devour
Willow Rosebloom&#39;s books.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to die,&quot; Willow groaned.

Lydia chuckled, more than a bit amused by how cute
Willow was being. &quot;Two regular dinners, please,&quot; she
asked the young man behind the counter.

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; he agreed as he put the order to
the chef in the back.

Within a few minutes they were served and sitting at a
corner table, digging in to a surprisingly good meal.
&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Willow admitted after a moment.

&quot;Are you really that ashamed of your books?&quot; Lydia
asked, sounding surprised. &quot;I know they&#39;re not great
literature, but...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not ashamed of them, exactly,&quot; Willow mused, &quot;but
they&#39;re not really that significant to me. Basically,
they just help pay the bills...&quot;

&quot;Until you write the great American novel?&quot; Lydia
guessed teasingly.

&quot;I&#39;m not that ambitious,&quot; Willow smiled, &quot;but I would
like to publish a more serious book eventually.&quot;

&quot;Why not write on one witchcraft?&quot; Lydia suggested
eagerly. &quot;There hasn&#39;t been a serious book on the
topic in years...&quot;

Willow looked faintly pained, &quot;I&#39;m not sure my path in
witchcraft is one I&#39;d want others to follow, you
know.&quot;

Lydia winced. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, well aware of
Willow&#39;s somewhat spotty past, &quot;I didn&#39;t think...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Willow forced a natural looking
smile onto her face, reaching out to pat Lydia&#39;s hand
reassuringly.

The rest of the meal Lydia carefully kept the
conversation much lighter, passing on amusing Slayer
related stories, sharing some gossip on Giles and
talking about other mutual friends and acquaintances.

Willow chuckled at one account then suddenly yawned,
looking embarrassed. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she smiled, blushing.

&quot;I guess it&#39;s been a long day,&quot; Lydia smiled as she
stood and offered Willow a hand, &quot;lets get you to your
quarters.&quot;

Still talking comfortably they made their way up two
levels in the rebuilt castle where several guest
suites had been set up. Stopping in front of a door
Lydia produced a keycard from her pocket and swiped
the reader, opening the door with a soft click.

&quot;Here,&quot; Lydia handed the card to Willow, &quot;once swiped
the door is keyed to this card only and can&#39;t be
opened by any other one except by a command override.&quot;

&quot;Sounds private,&quot; Willow admitted as she put the card
in her pocket.

Lydia smiled as she gave Willow a searching look,
&quot;Sometimes privacy is a good thing.&quot; Then she took a
step forward and gently pressed her lips to Willow&#39;s.
But as soon as she felt her stiffen and pull away
Lydia drew back, blushing as she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;No, I am,&quot; Willow sighed softly then added with a sad
smile, &quot;You&#39;re a nice lady, but I&#39;m not... free.&quot;

Lydia looked sullen, &quot;I read your file, you&#39;re not
dating anyone.&quot;

Willow felt a flash of irritation at that, but kept it
out of her voice. &quot;Maybe not,&quot; she said, &quot;but I don&#39;t
do casual.&quot;

Lydia nodded, &quot;It seems I got my wires crossed, please
excuse me.&quot; Then, back stiff with embarrassment, Lydia
stalked off.

&quot;This has just not been my night,&quot; Willow sighed as
she went into her suite.</pre>
