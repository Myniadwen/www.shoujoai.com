<h1>Artistry</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ronin.html">Ronin</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Dedicated to a real good friend that resurrected the Daria hentai/sex 
genere after FF.Net did its great porn purge, the one and only Thea 
Zara. Kudos to you, T. Z.!! 


Following the graduation events at Lawndale High, came tragedy and 
surprise. Tragedy, because Kevin Thomson and his folks were killed in an 
auto crash, days after the graduation, along with Brittany Taylor 
getting arrested on charges of drunk driving, having partied by herself 
to celebrate her seperation from Kevin with four bottles of wine and 
driving all over Lawndale, causing havoc. Needless to say, her license 
was revoked and worse still, got 40 days in jail, to the distress of her 
family. Surprise, because after the breakup of The Fashion Club, Sandi, 
along with all her belongings, vanished without a trace, to the chagrin 
of her mom, Linda. In fact, not much was seen and heard from neither 
Stacy nor Tiffany. But all that didn&#39;t mean a thing to the only artist 
in Lawndale known as Jane Lane, who even now, had plenty on her mind, 
starting with the thought of losing her partner in crime, Daria, who was 
bound for Raft Collage. To miss her only friend, ever since she first 
came to Lawndale--Daria, that is. Not to mention the fact her months 
long breakup with Tom Sloane was still on her mind. 

Night. And with it, a troubled Jane, a lot on her mind, walking past 
House Morgendoffer--and that was when the black haired artist looked up 
and saw a light in one of the windows, and the driveway empty. Out of 
habit, in the hopes that Daria was home, Jane walked up to the door. Now 
maybe she could tell her friend how she felt how much she was going to 
miss her while in collage--something Jane had never been able to express 
to Daria days before. Upon knocking on the door which opened, Jane was 
surprised to see Daria&#39;s sister Quinn, who said, &quot;Hey, Jane. If you&#39;re 
hoping to meet with Daria, she&#39;s on a date with Tom.&quot; 

&quot;Oh.....maybe some other time when she&#39;s home. Just tell her Jane was 
here.&quot; Try as she might, Jane couldn&#39;t hide the somber mood in her 
voice. 

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; asked Quinn. 

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t wanna know,&quot; said the artist. &quot;When Daria gets home, tell 
her I was here, OK?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Jane, you just got here and besides, Daria will be here in an 
hour.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re her sister, so why should I trust you when it comes to my 
missing her when she goes off to collage--&quot; 

Upon discovering her Freudian slip, Jane paled and turned to run, and 
that was when Quinn called out, &quot;Jane, wait. You can trust me. Why don&#39;t 
you talk to me while I hang up my dresses in the closet. My window 
overlooks the street, so--&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know....,&quot; said a doubtful Jane. 

&quot;Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, 
oh, please, oh, please!!&quot; Quinn&#39;s voice was a forlorn wimper, which to 
Jane meant that the redhead fashion girl was no doubt lonely and only 
wanted some company. 

Finally, the artist shrugged her shoulders and said, &quot;What&#39;ve we got to 
lose?&quot; before following Quinn inside the house and up the stairs to her 
room where she was hanging up the last of her fancy formal party dresses 
in her closet, while the redhead&#39;s boom box was tuned to the radio 
station featuring Spatula Man. 

&quot;So you haven&#39;t told Daria how you feel &#39;bout you two going to seperate 
collages?&quot; asked the redhead. 

Sighing, the black haired artist said, &quot;No, Quinn, I hadn&#39;t. Considering 
she and I will possibly be in Boston, we&#39;ll no doubt be in seperate 
collages....it&#39;s sad to say goodby to an old friend.....&quot; Jane broke 
off, her eyes noticing the sad look in Quinn&#39;s brown eyes. 

Those eyes......true, over the years, Jane hadn&#39;t bothered with Quinn&#39;s 
beautiful face, much less her body, but right now, the artist had to 
admit that it was no wonder so many guys, including The 3 J&#39;s went gaga 
for the redhead--she was THAT beautiful, with her long silken red hair, 
her sweet kissable candy mouth with the lip gloss, her pointy chin, 
petite body, chocolate brown eyes and melodious voice with the trance 
like lullaby quality--so it was no wonder the artist felt like she was 
hypnotized when Quinn spoke: 

&quot;You think I don&#39;t know that? I........I am so....so.....oh, I don&#39;t 
know how to express how I am going to miss Daria when she goes....I know 
I never had any big expressions of love for Daria for so many years, and 
I know she ain&#39;t a great sister......but,&quot;--here, Quinn&#39;s voice was lost 
in her sobs--&quot;I love her, Jane!! I always DID love her, and I always 
will!! And why? Because she was my sister, and I love her....!!&quot; The 
tears streamed down the redhead&#39;s face, like tiny pearl drops--so it was 
no wonder that somehow, Jane found herself hugging Daria&#39;s sister, 
feeling her willowy body press against hers, one hand caressing Quinn&#39;s 
red hair, the other, feeling her waist, how soft it felt. For the 
moment, despite her reputation as a one of the unconformitive set, Jane 
was enjoying how Quinn&#39;s touch felt to her, so much so, that she was 
jolted out of her newfound bliss by Quinn saying: &quot;Jane? You OK? What&#39;s 
with you?&quot; 

Stepping back, the artist stammered, &quot;Oop, sorry &#39;bout that.&quot; 

Her tears already dried, a quizzical Quinn gazed at Jane saying, &quot;Y&#39; 
know......I don&#39;t blame you. I mean, if I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d 
swear you were in love with me.&quot; 

&quot;You?!? You&#39;re nuts, Super Q. I was born hertosexual and besides, you 
and your fellow FC drones have dated lots of guys. So that part is kinda 
off, eh?&quot; 

&quot;But sometimes you can&#39;t help but wonder if you&#39;re bi. They say it 
doesn&#39;t hurt to try something new for a change.&quot; 

&quot;So you think you&#39;re bisexual? A repressed lesbian?&quot; 

&quot;Now that I think of it......(sigh)....&quot; Quinn hung her head and 
murmured, &quot;....oh, what the hey? Jane, ever since me Daria, mom and dad 
first came to Lawndale, since I first met you when I spent the night at 
your place............you could say I......I....I....I had a crush on 
you....&quot; 

Indeed Jane wasn&#39;t perpared for that statement; she jumped back a bit 
and squawked, &quot;WHAT?!? You were in love with me?!? Ged outa here, you&#39;re 
NUTS!!&quot; 

Sounding as if she was almost ready to cry, the redhead stammered, 
&quot;Um.......well, I wasn&#39;t at first, but as the years passed, I got to 
know you, and how I liked your talent for artistry, your outlook on 
almost anything, how you gave my sister the best friendship she needed 
in times like these, but I kinda liked your voice, your black hair--but 
I also liked you blue eyes; I kinda thought they were sexy.&quot; 

At that, all the artist could do was laugh, &quot;Quinn!!&quot; 

&quot;Well, it&#39;s the truth. Those crystalline blue eyes remind me of those 
new no smear eyeshadows from Cashman&#39;s.&quot; 

Jane, for her part, had to admit, that inasmuch as what Quinn had said 
sounded like one of those Fashion Club--well, sayings, she had to admit 
it WAS a good compliment when it came to her blue eyes. In fact, Quinn 
was even now, staring deeply into those said blue eyes, resulting in the 
artist staring into the redhead&#39;s lovely brown eyes. And all the while, 
Jane was stammering, &quot;Y-you know, if Daria got back and saw me, her best 
friend, in a compromising pose with you, her sister, she&#39;d shred our 
jockey shorts.&quot; 

&quot;JA-A-A-A-ANE!!&quot; said Quinn. &quot;EWWWW!!!! Besides, we&#39;re girls!! And girls 
like me and you don&#39;t wear jockey shorts!! Panties, sure, but NOT jockey 
shorts!!&quot; 

&quot;OK, she&#39;ll shred our jockey panties then.&quot; There was a slight grin on 
Jane&#39;s face while Quinn took to laughing her head off. But once again, 
the artist and the redhead took to staring at each other, their noses 
almost touching. 

&quot;So....,&quot; said Jane, &quot;what do you want me to say? How &#39;bout, &#39;Oh, Quinn, 
I love you too?&#39;&quot; 

Again, Quinn giggled, &quot;Oh, Jane, you don&#39;t have to say that.&quot; 

&quot;Listen--I did say I was hertosexual, but y&#39; know, you kinda sparked my 
curiousity.&quot; 

&quot;Meaning?&quot; 

&quot;Meaning that they say there&#39;s a first time for everything......I don&#39;t 
know, but, I can see why you&#39;re so popular; all the guys in Lawndale 
High want you so much.&quot; 

&quot;And I can see why you and Daria became best friends--you&#39;re so......&quot; 
Quinn sought out the right word and added, &quot;......so easy to get along 
with.&quot; 

&quot;You think so?&quot; said Jane. &quot;It&#39;s because me and Daria, well, we&#39;re on 
the unpopular set, we&#39;re brains, and well.....&quot; By now, their mouths 
were way close--and that was when the artist said, &quot;Supposing I do kiss 
you--fine. You think that&#39;ll prove we&#39;re bi....?&quot; 

&quot;Only one way to be sure........,&quot; said the redhead, who moved in close, 
and with one tiny wet tongue, licked to trace Jane&#39;s mouth, a sensation 
that took the aritst by surprise at first before she did the same to the 
redhead&#39;s candy sized mouth, tasting the strawberry lip gloss that 
covered those oh so kissable lips of Quinn&#39;s--and that was when Jane was 
overcome with a wave of heat and desire which covered every nerve of 
hers with tingles, her nipples already erect beneath her clothing; 
already, she could faintly see Quinn&#39;s nipples stick out from beneath 
her pink blouse with the gold butterfly. 

Unable to control themseves, the girls kissed each other full on each 
other&#39;s mouths, a bit hesitantly at first, then with more feeling, 
progressively turning into a french kiss. For Jane Lane, the feel of 
kissing a girl, as well as entwining her tongue with one like Quinn 
wasn&#39;t anything like kissing Mystik Sprial&#39;s Jesse Moreno. Far from it. 
That kind of feeling was not like anything she had experienced, since 
she had first discovered her talent for art. No wonder such lesbian fan 
fiction stories, for that matter, the fan fiction that the artist would 
read on The Internet, were so popular. For Quinn Morgendorffer, the feel 
of kissing another girl was a whole new feeling, so different from 
kissing all the other guys in the past. Indeed, it was no wonder the 
redhead felt so passive, holding onto the artist, feeling her body, 
every curve fitting just right with the fashion princess.....and 
wondering what Jane&#39;s body was like. If only the other members of the 
now defunct Fashion Club could see her now......... 

Jane and Quinn were in their own version of seventh heaven when their 
kiss deepened, each girl running her fingers though each other&#39;s hair, 
Quinn&#39;s long red hair was silken and satiny, with traces of gardenia 
while Jane&#39;s black hair had that scent of rose with that feeling of 
clean. In any case, Jane broke the kiss to say, &quot;Hey--you wanna be naked 
an&#39; make love?&quot; 

&quot;Um.........ok,&quot; replied Quinn. 

&quot;Just wanted to be sure. So----in the words of Shakespere, into the 
breach.&quot; 

From there, the artist and the redhead took off each other&#39;s clothing, 
till the former was in her red bra and panty, and the latter, in her 
white lingerie. Then after they stripped out from that, Jane, with her 
size b cup breasts and thick nipples and supple body, and Quinn, with 
her c cup breasts and firm nipples and slim alabaster body she kept firm 
and trim, through years with power yoga held each other, loving the feel 
from each other&#39;s naked bodies, breasts and nipples pressing each 
other&#39;s while they kissed--and it was at that point, that Spatula Man, 
on Quinn&#39;s radio, spoke: 

&quot;OK, OK, for all you dudes an&#39; dudettes throughout Lawndale, we&#39;ve got 
just THE numero uno tune for all those full moonlit nights--Naked Eyes 
doin&#39;, When The Lights Go Out.&quot; 

Laying down on her bed, her long red hair fanning out, Quinn sighed, 
&quot;Seduce me.&quot; 

&quot;Listen, girl,&quot; said Jane. &quot;I&#39;ll do more than that, so just enjoy it, 
eh?&quot; With that in mind, the artist laid down on top of her and gave her 
a long french kiss, while Naked Eyes could be heard: 

Susie doesn&#39;t go out very much 
She likes to stay in bed at night 
It seems that everything is all too much 
but she just lays in bed at night 

From there, Jane was rubbing, fondling and massaging Quinn&#39;s breasts, 
their silk smooth feel as smooth as glass, the redhead&#39;s nipples good 
and stiff, so it was no wonder the redhead gasped and sighed with 
pleasure, breathing, &quot;Mmmmm.......you&#39;ve got such soft palms and 
fingers.... you make me feel SO good....suck my breasts....make me feel 
good in my nipples....I feel so wet....&quot; 

Jane did just that--in fact, she not only licked, sucked and kissed 
Quinn&#39;s breasts and nipples, she also used her index and center finger 
to finger the redhead&#39;s clit and vagina till it was gushing lots of 
fluid, the fashion princess writhing and crying out in her passion. 
&quot;OH!! Oh, Jane, you givie it to me so GOOD!! Give me more....!!&quot; 

Which was what Jane did, till she took to sticking her tongue in the now 
wet vagina of Quinn, licking the hard clit, which sent the redhead in 
hyperdrive, wailing beyond control-- before the artist went and cleaned 
out and ate out the now writhing Quinn, whose body felt like it was on 
an all time high, enveloped in flames of passion, enjoying the wave 
after wave of incredable love. 

The day&#39;s all right but then.... 
when the lights go out 
she calls your name 
When the lights go out 
Always the same 
Always someone left out in the rain 
It&#39;s always the same 

Jane didn&#39;t stop until Quinn came, her fluid pouring all over her face, 
which the artist drank up, like some kind of nectar, fingering the girl 
for one last peak of orgasm before sticking it in the redhead&#39;s mouth so 
she could taste her own juice. 

&quot;Mmmmm.....so good,&quot; Quinn murmured. &quot;Now it&#39;s my turn.&quot; 

&quot;Give me your best, girl,&quot; said Jane, who laid down on her back and 
opened her legs wide. 

&quot;Oh, believe me, I will,&quot; said the redhead, who wasted no time in using 
the same mouth and tongue work on the artist&#39;s breasts and nipples while 
fingering her, till juice was coming out from the vagina, Jane was 
wildly shaking and gasping all over the bed, and her nipples, now hard 
as rocks, filled Quinn&#39;s mouth. Moan after moan came from the artist as 
she was hit time and again by a surge of what she could only describe 
as, in the words of The Who, an amazing journey--which got amazing 
still, when at one point,the redhead rubbed Jane&#39;s breasts and nipples, 
each rub on her hard nipple sending jolts of ectasy through her body. 

She&#39;s the kind who needs the tender touch 
She never wants to compromise 
What you thought you&#39;d never have gets up 
and disappears before your eyes 

The day&#39;s all right but then.... 
when the lights go out, 
she calls your name 
When the lights go out 
Always the same 
Always someone left out in the rain 
It&#39;s always the same 
It&#39;s always the same.... 

It didn&#39;t take long for Quinn to go down on Jane&#39;s clit and vagina and 
eat her out till the black haired Lane girl writhed, gasping, 
&quot;Q-Quinn.......!! I.....I......I.......I.....I want it all......!!&quot; 

But even after Jane came, showering Quinn with her juice, she still 
didn&#39;t stop there--for she then turned the redhead over so she was 
laying on her back. with the black haired artist on top of her before 
the girls took to hot french kissing while fingering each other; the 
result was that it didn&#39;t take long for Jane and Quinn to moan 
passionately in their kiss, the artist fingering the redhead, and the 
redhead fingering the artist. One thing was for sure--all that brought 
them to the ultimate sexual peak. 

The day&#39;s all right but then.... 
when the lights go out, 
she calls your name 
When the lights go out 
Always the same 
Always someone left out in the rain 
It&#39;s always the same 

The day&#39;s all right but then.... 
when the lights go out, 
she calls your name 
When the lights go out 
Always the same 
Always someone left out in the rain 
It&#39;s always the same 
It&#39;s always the same 
It&#39;s always the same...... 

No sooner did Quinn and Jane come, they moaned something fierce in their 
kiss while their orgasm exploded within them with the power of 1200 
H-bombs; right now, they were holding each other, sharing a kiss. 

&quot;Oh, Jane, I love you too,&quot; breathed the redhead. 

Laughing, the artist said, &quot;Deja vu, eh, Super Q? But all joking aside, 
that was quite a trip. Maybe I should create a new art concept based on 
what we&#39;ve experienced, and call it The New Ultimate Trip.&quot; 

&quot;I never felt that way,&quot; said Quinn, &quot;since Cashman&#39;s had that baby tee 
two for one sale. But I LOVED what we just did all the same.&quot; After a 
pause, she added, &quot;Jane, promise me you don&#39;t say anything to the now 
deceased Fashion Club, what we just did.&quot; 

&quot;Sure, if you promise me you don&#39;t say anything to Trent, nor Jesse, nor 
Nick, nor Max, nor Monique, nor Tom, nor even Daria what we just did.&quot; 

&quot;Sure. To quote Gloria Estefan, anything for you.&quot; 

For a moment, Quinn and Jane grinned at each other while they held each 
other, the artist&#39;s head between the redhead&#39;s breasts. And 
then.........Jane Lane did something she never thought she do at all 
before. Put simply, she said, &quot;Quinn......I hope some day Daria, Tom, 
Trent, Jesse and the rest will forgive me, but right now, I love 
you....&quot; 

With her dazzling smile--the first one she gave in a long time--Quinn 
Morgendorffer replied in the most joyous way, &quot;I love you too, Jane,&quot; 
before she placed the most loving kiss on her new lover&#39;s mouth. 

When Daria came home, she was surprised to see a dressed Jane waiting 
for her at the foot of the stairs. &quot;Waiting for you, I was,&quot; she said. 

&quot;You amaze me sometimes,&quot; said the cynic. &quot;No wonder Trent said we were 
freaking friends.&quot; 

&quot;Let&#39;s just say his statement was justified. Listen, Daria, all joking 
aside, there&#39;s so much I wish to tell you, upstairs. It&#39;s....kinda 
important, before we&#39;re collage bound.....so much I feel....it&#39;s 
troubling me....&quot; 

&quot;Say no &#39;mo, partner in crime,&quot; said Daria, her Mona Lisa grin showing. 
&quot;It beats running &#39;round the town in a maid&#39;s uniform saying, &#39;Cock A 
Doodle Doo.&#39;&quot; 

Heading down the hall to Daria&#39;s bedroom, Jane, before entering, looked 
back across the hall, and saw Quinn, standing outside her bedroom; for a 
moment, the artist winked at the redhead, who winked back, before the 
artist amiga to Daria known as Jane Lane stepped inside her cync 
friend&#39;s humble abode......
