<h1>Kitty and Illyana: A Tale of Magik! (part 5 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        &quot;Logan,&quot; Kitty cried, throwing her arms around him in a hug.

        Logan grinned, patting her on the back, &quot;It&#39;s good to see you 
back here, kid. You and Illyanna just visiting?&quot;

        &quot;Illyanna&#39;s visiting Peter and I though I&#39;d stop in to see 
you,&quot; Kitty smiled.

        &quot;You ain&#39;t stopping in to see Pete?&quot; Logan raised an eyebrow.

        Kitty looked away, &quot;No, I&#39;m not.&quot;

        &quot;Guess the crush has ran it&#39;s course,&quot; Logan remarked dryly.

        Kitty sighed, feeling just a bit irritated at how easily Logan 
could read her, even after being away a few months. &quot;Something like 
that,&quot; she conceded. She looked around curiously, &quot;Where&#39;s Lockheed? 
How&#39;s he been doing?&quot;

        &quot;Irritated you&#39;ve been away, Kitten,&quot; Storm&#39;s voice came from 
the doorway. Ororo walked in, and Lockheed flew from her arms towards 
Kitty.

        Lockheed circled around her, &quot;Coo!&quot; He agilely settled onto 
her shoulder, wrapping his tail around her neck and purring softly.

        &quot;Who&#39;s been a good dragon,&quot; Kitty murmured, scratching 
Lockheed behind the ears.

        &quot;Not him, certainly,&quot; Ororo chuckled.

        Kitty remembered a vision that she had called up in the 
scrying pool, a image of Ororo dressed in biker&#39;s leathers and her 
hair cut into a mohawk. &#39;Never happen,&#39; she though, looking over at 
the motherly African woman standing there.

        &quot;He&#39;s been a real trouble causer,&quot; Logan nodded to Lockheed. 
He looked at Kitty curiously, &quot;Why not have him over at Doc Strange&#39;s 
place?&quot;

        Kitty shook her head, &quot;Can&#39;t risk it. With all the fragile 
mystic artifacts around, he&#39;s probably end up accidentally opening a 
portal to the Dark Dimension the first day.&quot; A soft sigh, &quot;And I don&#39;t 
think I could bear seeing him hurt or killed because of me.&quot;

        &quot;I understand,&quot; Ororo nodded. She looked over at Kitty 
curiously, at the pendant that she was wearing around her neck, &quot;What 
is that?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s a lesser amulet that Dr. Strange gave me,&quot; Kitty smiled 
as she gestured to the square silver pendant. &quot;It&#39;s tied to his own 
Eye of Augamoto, and is particularly effective against creatures of 
demonic evil,&quot; she explained to them cheerfully.

        &quot;Not bad,&quot; Logan nodded. He quirked an eyebrow, &quot;So how&#39;s the 
magic lessons going?&quot;

        &quot;Care for a demonstration?&quot; Kitty asked with a smile. Both 
quickly turned down that offer and she laughed, &quot;Pretty well, I 
think.&quot;

        Over in another wing of Professor Xavier&#39;s School for Gifted 
Youngsters Peter Rasputin worked on a painting, his sister sitting on 
his bed while they talked quietly. The image was a portrait, but of 
whom wasn&#39;t quite clear.

        &quot;So I wanted to know what you thought,&quot; Illyanna finished.

        Peter used a brush to put a bit more pain on the canvas, &quot;You 
and her?&quot; A short pause before he admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t think I ever 
realized.&quot;

        &quot;Neither did I, really,&quot; Illyanna sighed. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to 
let myself realized, especially since I knew she had a crush on you,&quot; 
she added.

        &quot;Katya,&quot; Peter smiled slightly, &quot;in a way, I&#39;m glad that she&#39;s 
over me.&quot; He blushed just a bit, &quot;I&#39;ve met someone recently, and I was 
feeling a bit guilty.&quot;

        &quot;Then I&#39;m glad for you,&quot; Illyanna smiled up at him happily. 
She hesitated a bit, &quot;You.. don&#39;t mind, do you?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;ll take some getting used to,&quot; Peter cautioned her, &quot;but 
if you&#39;re happy, I&#39;m happy. Have you told her about how you feel?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Illyanna smiled, &quot;I sort of blurted it out to her.&quot; A 
soft sigh, &quot;But she hasn&#39;t told me yet how she feels about it.&quot;

        &quot;Katya had best treat you well,&quot; Peter intoned, fully in his 
protective big brother mode, &quot;or she will have to answer to me.&quot;

        Illyanna snickered softly at that.

        &quot;What?&quot; Peter looked at her in surprise.

        &quot;Kitty&#39;s pretty good at combat magic, too,&quot; Illyanna said with 
a smirk, &quot;if she wanted to, you couldn&#39;t even get near her.&quot;

        Peter transformed a moment into Colossus, &quot;But magic is 
vulnerable against steel, is it not?&quot;

        Illyanna was dead serious as she said, &quot;Trust me, Kitty would 
figure out a way around that.&quot; She got up off the bed and gave him a 
hug, &quot;See you later, Peter.&quot;

        With that, Illyanna summoned a stepping disk and teleported 
out of the room, only to reappear in an office. The bald headed man 
sitting behind the desk looked up at her with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m glad you 
could come by to visit.&quot;

        &quot;Hello, Professor,&quot; Illyanna smiled at him, &quot;it&#39;s been a 
while.&quot; She pulled over a chair and sat in front of the desk, &quot;You 
mind-called me, I came. What&#39;s up?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve talked to Stephen,&quot; Professor Xavier said quietly, &quot;he&#39;s 
told me a bit more about the Bloodstones you wear.&quot;

        Illyanna nodded grimly, grasping the locket she always wore. 
The Bloodstones, created from three pieces of her very soul, 
consecrated to try to open a gateway to one of the demon dimensions. 
Belasco had created them when he held her captive in the dimension of 
Limbo, and they still bound her to him in the darkest of ways.

        &quot;Dr. Strange has taken some precautions,&quot; Illyanna smiled 
grimly. &quot;He&#39;s given one of his lesser amulets to Kitty, so if Belasco 
does manage to turn me, Kitty can fight me if necessary,&quot; she 
explained to him quietly.

        &quot;If Belasco does return to this dimension,&quot; the Professor 
pledged, &quot;the X-Men will do everything that they can to help.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Illyanna smiled. She sighed softly, &quot;Besides, I&#39;ve 
got more important things to worry about right now.&quot;

        The Professor&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Like determining if Kitty 
shares your feelings.&quot;

        &quot;Professor!&quot; Illyanna jerked up in her chair.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Professor Xavier apologized, &quot;occasionally a forceful 
thought will just leap out and hit me right between the eyes.&quot;

        Back with Kitty and the others Lockheed was enjoying a good 
ear scratching as Kitty caught them up on what had been happening to 
her.

        &quot;So Illyanna&#39;s interested in you,&quot; Logan said thoughtfully.

        &quot;Have you told her about how you feel?&quot; Ororo asked curiously.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know how I feel,&quot; Kitty sighed. She smiled at them 
wryly, &quot;This is all a little new to me, you know.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Logan said, &quot;but I wouldn&#39;t want to be Illyanna right 
now.&quot;

        Ororo nodded gravely, &quot;It must be difficult for her, having 
revealed her own feelings but not yet knowing what yours are.&quot;

        Kitty leaned back in her seat with a sigh, &quot;I guess you&#39;re 
right. I owe it to her to at least try to figure this all out.&quot;
