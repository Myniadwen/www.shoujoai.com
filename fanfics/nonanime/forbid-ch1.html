<h1>Forbidden Passions</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rpgstoryman.html">Ima Doofus</a><br> </h2>
<pre>She had always detested the train ride. It was pleasant enough, rather 
scenic, but that lost its luster after 8 trips too and from the giant 
castle that the students flocked too after the summer months. She sat 
there, faking a smile as she watched the mountains drift away into the 
horizon, the very same mountains from the previous trip. She sighed 
inaudibly, and her gaze drifted to the boys that where sharing her 
car.

There was Ron, visibly a Weasly. His red hair and freckled face was 
almost classic, the family having produced 6 or 7 of them, she 
couldn&#39;t remember the exact number at the moment.

Then there was Harry, the celebrity of the school. He was the only one 
to survive an attack by the Dark Lord himself, but of course, everyone 
knew THAT...He was also quite prone to sticking his nose where it 
didn&#39;t belong. In her 4 previous years at Hogwarts, she had watch as 
he damn near killed himself on his adventures, not to mention 
Quidditch. 

She sighed heavily as Ron half-missed his mouth with a struggling 
chocolate frog.

He mumbled a couple words, before swallowing and continuing in a 
language she understood. &quot;-- glum, Hermione?&quot;

&quot;Just anxious to get back too school...&quot; She trailed off, her thoughts 
finally back to something positive. For the remainder of the ride, she 
thought about school, but her thoughts soon drifted to someone rather 
unexpected. Cho Chang.

&#39;No!&#39; She almost said out loud, she was a GOOD girl. She was supposed 
to like boys. Like Harry. She forced herself too gawk at him for the 
remainder of the trip. She fantasized about things that just weren&#146;t 
there; like his strong, muscular arms and his firm stomach. None of 
this appealed to her, but she wouldn&#39;t let herself believe it. 

She continued creating things about Harry until the train came to a 
stop and Ron spilled some Butter Beer, a new addition to the cart, all 
over her robes. She looked up at him, a naughty look still in her eye, 
which caught Ron off guard. 

He opened his mouth to comment, but Hermione shifted her eyes to 
something that much more resembled a glare, and cast a drying spell 
quickly on herself before leaving the car.

She followed the other 5th years through the door, sticking close to 
Harry and Ron. They arrived with the crowed for a change and actually 
got to see the sorting for a change. They where usually knee-deep in a 
miss-adventure that could get them expelled easily by now...

Damn she was beautiful! Hermione almost slapped herself when she 
caught her thoughts wandering when she met the eyes of Cho Chang, a 
sixth year who played as a Seeker for the Ravenclaw house team. They 
flashed each other a quick, girlish smile before they sat before empty 
plates to hear Dumbledores speech.

She didn&#39;t bother to listen. Her friends had made a nasty habit of 
doing the opposite of what he was saying each year, and she was 
usually along for the ride. Not that she didn&#39;t enjoy it, but, she did 
not enjoy the threat of expulsion that would have found them long 
before if Dumbledore hadn&#39;t taken a liking to the group.

&quot;I&#39;d very much like too put a boot in that boy&#39;s ass,&quot; Ron began, 
obviously referring to Malfoy. It wasn&#39;t much of her concern what he 
was doing. The kid was breathing, and that was enough to get her more 
masculine companions complaining about him. &quot;Now he&#39;s flaunting some 
new Quidditch robes his father got him...&quot;

She sighed. She was hardly in the mood for their immature squabbles at 
the moment. She had more important matters too attend too. Like 
scaring herself straight.

For a good while, there was the mundane Hogwarts life. She drifted 
through without much of a place, punishing herself for quick glances 
at Cho&#39;s wonderfully maturing body...

That woman had to be out to get her. She HAD to be bewitched. She was 
a good girl! She wasn&#39;t raised to be like...like this! She was going 
to settle down with a nice man in a nice house out in the countryside, 
and have lots of kids that would go to Hogwarts and live perfectly 
NORMAL wizarding lives.

Harry. It was obvious that he was interested in her, even though she 
had caught him gawking at Cho quite a few times. He wasn&#39;t quite as 
slick as she was...She managed a chuckle and began to plan. She HAD to 
make herself...available to Harry.

Yes. She just needed to have a real boyfriend to get these silly 
thoughts out of her head. She began rehearsing her plan, when she 
bumped into the last person she had wanted to see right now. She had 
been running back to the common room and collided with Cho Chang, much 
to the delight of a few Slytherins, which included Draco Malfoy.

&quot;Oh! I&#39;m so sorry...&quot; Cho said, obviously not fully over the events 
that happened last year, the one involving Cedric. Hermione felt sorry 
for her, having been through so much. A pity, really.

&quot;Quite alright.&quot; she replied cheerfully, and helped Cho back to her 
feet and handed her the books that had fallen along with her. Hermione 
suddenly became nervous, and scrambled to get her own books together. 
Malfoy had surprisingly not made a comment thus far.

&quot;No, no...I wasn&#39;t watching where I was going,&quot; Cho said, shaking her 
head at Hermione. &quot;You alright?&quot;

&quot;Yes...yes...&quot; Hermione said, trying to regain her lost composure. 
&#147;Better be off to class...&#148;

&#147;There isn&#146;t any class right now...&#148; Cho replied, a questioning look 
on her face. &#147;Are you sure your alright?&#148;

&#147;Oh, silly me. There&#146;s just so much work that I&#146;m loosing track of the 
schedule.&#148; Hermione said, thinking quickly. She needed to get out of 
here. &#147;I better get to the common room, then. Homework.&#148;

Cho gave her a quizzical look and gave another quick &#147;Thanks&#148; and 
walked off, and Hermione sighed loudly and watched Malfoy&#146;s gaze 
follow her swaying hips down the corridor. When she was out of ear 
shot, he opened his mouth to make a comment about Hermione&#146;s heritage, 
but he was met with a firm slap before he could utter the word 
&#145;Mudblood&#146;.

She ran quickly to the common room to &#145;alter&#146; her pajamas. Why had she 
been so nervous around Cho? It was probably because she just so 
worried about her current situation...but there was a lot of tension 
there. It was so obvious that Draco MUST have seen it...

She cut quickly evened out the...alterations...too her pajamas. She 
had stolen Harry&#146;s potions assignment earlier today, so he would 
defiantly be up tonight working on it. She made another quick check 
too make sure the other girls where asleep and crept down the stairs 
to the common room. But Harry wasn&#146;t there. Ron was.

She paused about the fifth step down. This wasn&#146;t expected at all. She 
took a moment to watch him working diligently. He would have to do.

&#147;Hey, Ron...&#148; She said, trying not to sound erotic while not sounding 
afraid or nervous. She was failing.  

&#147;Erm, what are you doing down here?&#148; He asked uncomfortably, scrawling 
the answer to the last question on his potions assignment and slipping 
it in his bag.

&#147;Couldn&#146;t sleep.&#148; She said less-firm than she had intended, but she 
still continued walking over too him with her hips swaying, making 
sure he saw her luscious legs through the slits.

&#147;What did you do too your pajamas?&#148; He asked, raising a brow too the 
addition.

&#147;Oh, I coughed trying to make them longer. I think they still look 
decent, though. Don&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;Erm, yeah!&#148; Ron quickly replied, more enthusiasm than he had hoped.

Hermione laughed and sat next too him at the table. &#147;What are you up 
too?&#148; She asked, tracing her finger in small circles on the table.

&#147;Potions homework...I lost my potions assignment. I could have sworn 
Malfoy took it...&#148;

&#147;Oh, I&#146;m sorry...&#148; She said, moving her finger closer too him.

Ron was clearly getting nervous. He put his hands on the table and 
leaned the chair back a little bit, before taking his wand and 
bewitching it. Hermione purposely bumped her finger into his hand, 
before completely covering it with her own. Both where unsure of what 
too do now.

&#147;Hermione...what are you doing?&#148; Ron inquired, instantly angry about 
what he had said. He was obviously afraid he would ruin the moment, 
meaning he WAS attracted too her. She brightened up a tad.&#148;

&#147;Something I have been meaning to do for a while.&#148; She said, raising 
the hand too his face and leaning in for a kiss. Hermione slipped her 
tongue between his lips lightly, and then pulled it back into her own. 
Ron raised a hand too caress her face in encouragement, and it once 
again penetrated his lips.

Ron started working with his own, no idea what too do, but he figured 
he had managed ok. He lightly caressed her tongue with his own. It 
felt good, so he had too have been doing it right...

Hermione closed her eyes, kissing him deeply as Ron&#146;s hands slipped 
from her face too her 15-year-old breasts. He lightly squeezed and 
rubbed them, now so afraid of doing something wrong that the kiss had 
lost most of its feeling. Hermione simply kept her eyes closed and let 
her hands fall down too his chest. 

Cho had really become a good kisser after a while, her hands on her 
breasts almost burning with...Cho?! &#147;I...I just can&#146;t do this!&#148; 
Squealed Hermione, breaking the kiss and jumping up from the chair, 
causing Ron&#146;s too hid the ground with a thud. She ran up the stairs, 
her head in her hands, fighting back the tears.

She hit the mattress of her four-poster harder than she had wanted 
too; shutting her eyes tightly and desperately trying too forget the 
events that had just taken place. Why was she thinking of Cho? Was she 
so fixated on trying to &#145;cure&#146; herself that she had made it worse? She 
sobbed lightly and without even giving it a second thought took her 
wand and put a sleeping charm on herself.

Her dream, however, was probably worse than anything she could have 
done awake. She was lying in a field, a transparent veil draped over 
her naked body. She felt a light breeze ruffle it, and there she was. 
She felt the tenderness emanating from that girl in the red dress that 
stood before her, beckoning her too her feet. She stood, the veil 
fell. But she didn&#146;t feel embarrassed or any need too hide her 
nakedness. She just felt so...right. Cho leaned in and gave her a deep 
kiss, and then the charm wore off.

She woke with a start, seeing the other girls quickly dressing and 
running down the stairs too breakfast. Hermione did the same, though 
she had no desire what-so-ever too eat.

She did anyway, though. Ignoring Harry and Ron conversing about 
whatever shenanigan they where going too pull off this year. It had 
been normal so far, but Harry and Ron just couldn&#146;t deal with that. At 
least Ron hadn&#146;t told him about last night...yet...

&#147;Bah. I didn&#146;t get much sleep last night. Had to finish my potions 
homework. That damn Malfoy took it...if I could just prove it...&#148;

Hermione stopped eating, holding the latest forkful of eggs in 
mid-air. Ron noticed her nervousness and gave a slightly caring smile. 

&#147;How do you think I could do that? Snape might not give a damn, but 
I&#146;m sure McGonnagle would do something.&#148;

Hermione went back too her eggs. Ron would defiantly tell Harry at 
some point, and she didn&#146;t want too be around when he did. She quickly 
shoveled the rest of her plate into her mouth, left her seat, and 
suddenly wished she was there listening too Ron gloating about getting 
too first base.

~AN~ BWHAHAHAHAHAHHA! Eat cliffhanger! By the way, might be some h0t 
se&gt;&lt;0rs next chapter! Or not, depending on how much flack I catch for 
writing yuri about children&#146;s books. 

&#147;We need too talk,&#148; The statement hit her like a sack of bricks. The 
girl that stood before her, blocking her escape simply stood there 
waiting for an agreement. It was obvious that saying no was not a 
valid answer, as the look on her face clearly explained that she had 
lost a good amount of sleep deciding too confront Hermione, and even 
though Hermione could not think of  a place where she would rather not 
be, the only thing she could say was &#145;Ok.&#146;

&#147;Thanks...&#148; Cho said, sighing with relief as the majority of her 
embarrassment subsided. She made a slight motion too follow her with 
her hand and began down the corridor. Hermione wanted very much too 
slip into another of the giant castles passageways and never speak too 
her again. But she just couldn&#146;t do that. 

They walked for a good while, Hermione throwing her better judgment 
aside every step she made. The castle had quickly changed from its 
light hearted, pleasant atmosphere into one of fear. She tried to 
change what she was thinking about, but it did her no good. She simply 
chose too remember that she was wearing nothing but underwear under 
her robe. But, from the looks of it, Cho wasn&#146;t either. 

No matter what she told herself, she desperately wanted too talk as 
well. She followed Cho through what seemed like a solid wall and ended 
up in what looked like an old common room. 

&#147;It used too be another house common room, but the Ravenclaw 
complained enough to get another one. Kind of a house secret for us. I 
go here to think, mostly. No one will bother me here.&#148; She said 
thoughtfully, trying to start up a conversation. But Hermione could 
think of nothing too say.

She just smiled and thought for a moment, before noticing how dark it 
actually was. She quickly conjured up her signature blue flame and sat 
it on a desk nearby and simply watched the shadows dance across Cho&#146;s 
face. She smiled again.

&#147;What did you want too talk too me about?&#148; She asked trying to shield 
her nervousness, before realizing that she felt perfectly comfortable. 

&#147;I...had a dream the other night. About you...&#148;

&#147;I dreamt about you, too. That&#146;s kinda weird.&#148;

&#147;Well, I mean, it&#146;s not that uncommon for people that know each other 
too have the same dreams. I can&#146;t remember why, though. They told is 
in history of magic class.&#148;

Hermione sat down next too her fire and listened. 

&#147;Anyway, I also noticed that...I always get nervous when I&#146;m around 
you.&#148;

Hermione tried to smooth out her wild hair with one of her hands, 
feeling a bit embarrassed. &#147;I am the same way...&#148;

Cho looked a lot more relieved with that. &#147;And, well, after Cedric 
died I didn&#146;t really feel the same way about guys...The girls and me 
would go out and they&#146;d point at guys they thought looked good and 
giggle but I didn&#146;t really notice a difference...I thought I was just 
still grieving...&#148;

Obviously talking about Cedric wasn&#146;t a good subject, as Hermione 
could start too see Cho repress sobs. Hermione quickly tried to change 
the subject, but it was too late. Cho started tearing up.

Hermione didn&#146;t know what to do. She slowly got up, walked over too 
Cho, and gave her a light hug and told her it would be ok. Cho 
returned the hug, but she held onto Hermione for dear life. Hermione 
now had no idea of what too do next. She allowed Cho too sob into her 
robes for a while, before wrapping her arms around her again. 

Hermione started making small circles on Cho&#146;s back with her fingers, 
trying to calm her down. Cho eventually stopped crying, but didn&#146;t 
break the hug.

&#147;I&#146;m really sorry...I thought I was over it, but...&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s ok, really.&#148; Hermione said out of simple lack of anything else 
that she could think of. Hermione continued the circles on her back, 
even though Cho had long since stopped sobbing. It felt peaceful. 

Cho smiled lightly, and moved too get up. Her hand brushed Hermione&#146;s 
breasts, causing the brown haired girl too shiver. Cho noticed and 
immediately began apologizing. Hermione was getting slightly annoyed 
and before she realized what she was doing, the two girls&#146; lips had 
connected.

Neither of them moved for what seemed like hours, each of them 
confused and at the same time savoring how soft the others lips felt. 
Hermione realized that Cho didn&#146;t want too move too fast, but both of 
them felt that this was the right thing. They knew it was where they 
where supposed too be. Hermione slipped her tongue in the other girls&#146; 
mouth, just lightly at first. 

Cho did not reject, so Hermione tried it again. The two began too kiss 
more deeply, their hands exploring the others bodies. The two walked 
back, never breaking the kiss, and fell onto an old couch. 

Cho slid her hands down the younger girls&#146; body, caressing her every 
curve. Hermione simply laid back and enjoyed it. Cho&#146;s hands continued 
down too the bottom of the robe, tracing her fingers lightly on the 
hem before hesitantly slipping her hands inside. She kept a light, 
very sensuous touch as she traced up the outsides of the younger girls 
legs as the robe rode up with her and stopped at the stomach. She made 
light circles, feeling the skin clench lightly under her touch.

She broke the on-going kiss for a moment too give a look that said 
&#145;Are you sure?&#146;. Hermione vigorously nodded and their lips met again, 
Hermione raising her hands too the others face, pulling her closer. 

Cho&#146;s hands continued up too her partners bra, and she slowly slipped 
a finger under the material and caressed the smooth skin below. 
Hermione let a slight moan escape into her lovers&#146; mouth. Cho slipped 
her fingers all the way into the bra and made slight circles around 
the nipple. Cho broke the kiss too look down at her lover.

Her robe had ridden up too her waist, revealing her delicious looking 
legs and her plain white panties. She was just laying there, her hair 
completely disheveled with a look on her face that just screamed 
&#145;Touch me!&#146; Incredibly sexy.

Cho took one hand and pulled the robe off completely, keeping one hand 
where it was to massage her breasts. Cho went too lay back down, but 
Hermione met her half way, slipping the other girls robe off as well. 
She couldn&#146;t have ALL the fun. Cho smiled smugly and kissed her as 
they lay back onto the couch. Hermione slowly brought her hands up too 
cup the breasts of her lover, surprised at how soft and warm they 
felt, even through the bra. She needed more.   

Hermione reached up behind Cho and fumbled with the strap until it 
slid off into the floor. She immediately cupped them and slowly 
caressed them with her thumbs. Cho once again broke the kiss and 
removed Hermione&#146;s bra. She lowered her face again, but kissed her way 
down the brunettes neck too the tips of her breasts, lightly sucking 
on the skin. 

Hermione made another light moan, and continued stroking her lovers&#146; 
breasts. Cho then took a nipple into her mouth, lightly sucking and 
slipped one hand down the brunettes&#146; body, caressing her stomach. She 
slipped the hand down further, sliding over her inner thighs while her 
mouth continued working on the breast. 

Hermione was in complete bliss. She felt the pleasure rising all 
through her body as Cho&#146;s hand continued too get nearer too her 
womanhood. Cho slowly lifted her head, tracing a trail with her tongue 
too her lovers&#146; other breast, before quickly engulfing the nipple.

Cho&#146;s hand continued lightly stroking Hermione&#146;s inner thigh, brushing 
closer too her womanhood. Hermione was beginning too pant. Cho slowed 
down, tracing very lightly with her fingers as she reached the object 
of desire. Hermione froze as the fingers crept past the cloth 
boundary, ever so lightly stroking her vagina. Another moan crept out 
of her lips, only this time a little more audible.

Cho lifted off Hermione&#146;s breast and kissed her deeply again, and at 
the same time slowly dragging off her last article of clothing with 
the tip of her finger, and tossed it in the floor. 

Cho started too lightly prod Hermione&#146;s now exposed woman hood, while 
her own was being hungrily grabbed at. She rose up a little, allowing 
Hermione access. She slid her finger down the waistband of Cho&#146;s 
panties and provocatively slid them down her legs and into the floor. 

Cho got up and turned around, then laid back down on her nude lover in 
sort of a sixty-nine position, giving them both what they wanted. Cho 
started by slipping a simple finger into her partner until it met with 
resistance. Hermione moaned, and then gasped as the finger traveled 
deeper into her virginity. It did hurt, but it also felt so good at 
the same time that she couldn&#146;t say anything. She just lie there 
trying to put a finger on what she felt, and then the pain went away 
and was replaced by inexplicable pleasure. She moaned again, only this 
time much more audible

After Hermione regained her senses, she started her work on Cho. She 
found it somewhat hard too slip her finger all the way in, but she 
just slowly pushed, like Cho had done. Neither of them had any idea 
what they where doing, but it didn&#146;t matter. She could hear Cho trying 
to suppress moans, and that was all she needed.

Each of the girls started thrusting their fingers progressively 
faster. Hermione started too shake, and the smell that had started to 
fill the air only intensified the pleasure. Hermione could not prop 
herself up any longer. She lay down as the waves of pleasure became 
closer and closer together, shooting through her body like fire.

Hermione was trembling so hard it was becoming difficult too keep 
thrusting. She was laying down directly over her lovers&#146; womanhood, 
the smell of sex driving her wild. She had too taste it. She stuck her 
tongue forward into her, and she was instantly greeted with a rather 
loud moan. It tasted nice, as well. She licked again, then again, 
turning her head too gain better access.

Cho could take no more. The feeling of her lovers tongue was too much. 
Her body exploded, as the waves of orgasmic bliss hit her from head 
too toe, clenching every muscle in her body with such a fiery passion 
that she had no choice but too scream out her lovers name for all that 
cared too hear.

Cho&#146;s orgasm was enough for Hermione as well, whose body stopped 
trembling and went completely rigid and unable too move as the new 
sensation roared through her. She as well moaned the older girls name 
as her own orgasm subsided. They lie there panting for several 
moments, recalling what had just happened and enjoying the sheer 
perfection of each other before Cho rose up on trembling arms and 
opted that they get dressed.
