<a href="../nonanime/wreckage-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&quot;Not bad at all,&quot; Ron Black muttered as the somewhat
rumpled looking editor handed Carol Danvers a copy of
the Herald, her story on the attacking Trolls on the
front page.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Carol smiled, the blonde&#39;s eyes skimming
over the report though she knew it by heart. A summary
of the Trolls rampage, the heroes sudden appearance
and finally the defeat of all the creatures. The
business suited woman handed the preview copy back as
she added, &quot;I was just lucky to get so close.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get cocky,&quot; Ron said dryly as he headed to his
office, &quot;just because you&#39;ve gotten front page a few
times.&quot;

Carol nodded, &quot;Right.&quot;

&quot;Congratulations,&quot; Heather said, the brown haired
accountant smiling a bit as she swung by Carol&#39;s desk,
her jumpsuit neat and form fitting. She leaned her hip
against the desk and dropped her voice, &quot;You up to a
victory party with the girls?&quot;

&quot;Victory?&quot;Carol looked curious.

Heather gave her a grin as she reminded the other
woman, &quot;You&#39;ve beaten the two week curse of crime
reporters.&quot;

Carol smiled back as she teased, &quot;Did I forget to
mention I was quitting today?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t even joke,&quot; Heather laughed. She pushed herself
to her feet as she asked cheerfully, &quot;So, how about
it?&quot;

&quot;Why not,&quot; Carol said, &quot;meeting at the Oasis again?&quot;

&quot;Unless we find somewhere more interesting,&quot; Heather
said, &quot;we&#39;ll call you on your cellphone if needed.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Carol waved as Heather left the busy
newsroom.

Carol went to work on a rash of high tech robberies,
consulting her own notes and the police briefing. The
police weren&#39;t having much luck catching the
battle-armor clad crooks, and a few officers had
privately told her they were thinking of appealing for
superhuman aide.

&quot;Hey, Danvers,&quot; the rough voiced man said as a shadow
stretched over her desk,

&quot;Yes,&quot; Carol looked up, recognizing the older
reporter. Chad Smith was a fixture here, a forty year
old reporter who had worked his was up from a cub
reporter to a investigative journalist. Slouching
there in his stained suit he looked harmless, but
Carol watched him warily.

Chad dropped his voice, &quot;You know about Heather,
right?&quot;

Carol had a bad feeling she knew what he was talking
about, but played innocent. &quot;No, what?&quot; she asked
brightly.

&quot;She&#39;s a,&quot; Chard hissed, &quot;lesbian. Wouldn&#39;t want a
pretty girl like you getting involved with that type.&quot;

&quot;I never realized,&quot; Carol faked being surprised.

&quot;Yeah, those deviant types hide out everywhere,&quot; Chad
added in a whisper, &quot;you really have to watch
yourself.&quot;

Finally Carol couldn&#39;t control herself and burst into
laughter.

&quot;What?&quot; Chad reeled back in surprise.

&quot;What decade are you from?&quot; Carol sniggered. &quot;The evil
predatory lesbian is going to get me?&quot; she laughed.

&quot;Hump,&quot; Chad pulled back, straightening up his suit
before he stalked away, his back stiff with
irritation.

&quot;Way to go,&quot; Monica Strewart purred, the older redhead
grinning at Carol from her desk nearby. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she
added, &quot;should have warned you.&quot;

&quot;Bit reactionary?&quot; Carol looked amused.

&quot;Just a bit,&quot; Monica agreed. She checked her watch
then asked cheerfully, &quot;You want to go sneak out
early?&quot;

&quot;We going to get into trouble?&quot; Carol asked as she
saved her files.

&quot;We&#39;ve both got our stories on file for tomorrow&#39;s
edition,&quot; Monica countered, &quot;Ron should be happy, I
think.&quot; She laughed, &quot;If he;&#39;s short he can always
write another one of his long winded editorials.&quot;

Carol chuckled, knowing that was a regular tactic of
smaller papers. She got up and grabbed her coat, &quot;All
right, let&#39;s go.&quot;

Like two teenagers playing hooky Monica and Carol
hurried out of the newsroom, Monica giving the annoyed
looking Chad a cheerful little wave. Heading down to
the parking lot beneath the building Monica said, &quot;You
want to ride with me this time?&quot;

&quot;Oh what the hell,&quot; Carol shrugged, &quot;I can always get
a ride back.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure that Heather&#39;d be willing to give you a
ride,&quot; Monica teased, unlocking the doors of her older
model Toyota.

&quot;You too?&quot; Carol looked curious.

Monica got behind the wheel, smiling impishly as she
put the key in the ignition. &quot;Well, I think she&#39;s a
little curious about you,&quot; she revealed, both putting
on their seat belts. The car started up with a rumble
and they swung out into traffic, soon accelerating and
weaving between cars in a breakneck speeds.

If Carol wasn&#39;t mostly invulnerable she&#39;d have been
worried. As it was she was warily watching other cars,
hoping there wouldn&#39;t be a accident. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I
really swing that way,&quot; Carol said, a bit surprised at
any uncertainty in her voice. She thought of
Thunderstrike and felt herself blush just as little.

&quot;Oh ho,&quot; Monica smiled a bit, calmly evading a near
crash, again.

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Carol gasped as they zipped into a very small
space between two trucks. &quot;It&#39;s not exactly what you
think,&quot; she said.

&quot;I&#39;m not judging,&quot; Monica said as she whipped around a
corner, the whole car rocking a bit as it went up on
one wheel. &quot;Hell, I went out with Heather for a bit,&quot;
she confided, nearly talking out a mail box in the
process.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have thought...&quot; Coral said, gulping as
they raced at a garbage truck.

At the last moment Monica wrenched the wheel aside,
zipping them clear. &quot;I consider myself bi,&quot; she
revealed cheerfully, &quot;though I have to admit those
nights with Heather nearly turned me to the other side
of the force, so to speak.&quot;

Carol nearly choked at that.

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Monica proceeded to cut across several
lanes of traffic, causing squealing tires and loud
honking of horns. &quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; she said cheerfully.

Carol opened her eyes, only then becoming aware that
she had clenched her eyes shut for the last while. The
familiar Oasis bar was there, as she remembered, and
outside their friends were parked. &quot;Thank you for the
ride,&quot; she puffed out a relieved breath.

&quot;No problem,&quot; Monica laughed as they headed inside.

The bar was packed with men and woman and Carol
cheerfully let the aggressive Monica lead the way to a
back table. The usual suspects waved as they
approached, the band of women smiling greetings as
they each took their seats.

&quot;And the girl of the hour is here,&quot; Elisa drawled,
eyes twinkling.

&quot;Be nice, Elisa,&quot; Bette firmly elbowed her in the
ribs, the brash brown haired woman giving her a
scolding look.

Catty grinned, the lovely blonde helping the newcomers
steal some chairs from a nearby table. &quot;About time,&quot;
she said, &quot;I want to eat soon.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t these chairs belong to someone?&quot; Carol asked as
they pulled off the coats hanging on the chairs and
tossed them on a empty table.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Monica sat down, &quot;but do you really thing
they want to take on all of us?&quot;

&quot;No way,&quot; Catty laughed.

Lynn sniggered, the reddish-gold haired woman taking a
drink. &quot;You got that right,&quot; she nodded firmly in
agreement. She looked at Carol, &quot;Three front pagers in
as many weeks, I think that&#39;s a record.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Carol smiled, &quot;it was nothing.&quot;

There was soft laughter around the table at that
comment. Part of why Carol had made the front page was
because of how close she had gotten to the action, and
the sort of risks she had taken to do it. As people
who worked in the newspaper business they understood
the stakes involved, and how much more than nothing it
was.

Seeing Carol&#39;s discomfort on the focus on her Heather
spoke up to brightly ask, &quot;Well, who&#39;s ready to order
some food?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m starved,&quot; Catty admitted with a chuckle.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Carol said to Heather softly, and Heather
just flashed a bright smile.</pre>
