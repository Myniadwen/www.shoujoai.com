<a href="../nonanime/showcase-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Legion of Superheroes: Past in Flux

Legion World, the massive construct created by the resources of the 
Legion and it&#39;s sponsors floated in the void, not far from the Earth and 
it&#39;s lone moon. Deep inside, within a chamber that was armored and 
sealed to outside contact, one of the greatest labs of it&#39;s kind rested, 
almost always buzzing with activity.

Braniac Five pushed himself away from the display with a sigh, the green 
skinned blond rubbing at his eyes tiredly. &quot;You may be right, Lyle,&quot; he 
conceded, &quot;we may have to accept your hypertime theory.&quot;

Invisible Kid smiled, brown hair falling into Lyle Norg&#39;s eyes as he 
calmly noted, &quot;You don&#39;t sound too happy about that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Brainiac Five admitted, &quot;the concept of hypertime is just 
so... messy.&quot;

Invisible Kid chuckled at that, but he had to agree Brainy had a point. 
Hypertime was based around Quantum theory and the concept of each choice 
or possible action spawning timelines based off each possible outcome. 
In theory that meant there was a infinite number of expanding timelines 
but in reality the differences were often so slight the temporal 
waveform just collapsed and the timelines merged again seamlessly. Of 
course some choices were major, so there was a growing number of 
possible worlds in existence.

&quot;I wish we could go with the linear timeline theory too,&quot; Lyle added 
quietly, &quot;but this is the best explanation for our problems with the 
time viewer.&quot;

Brainy grunted softly in annoyance. The time viewer was a invention of 
his designed to allow them to gaze into specific eras in the past... the 
problem was, it seemed to show a different past each time it was used. 
Working with Invisible Kid they had worked out the concept of hypertime 
to explain the phenomena, but neither were happy with it.

&quot;I&#39;d better take our preliminary paper to Cosmic Boy,&quot; Brainy got up to 
pick up the datapad, &quot;as well as telling him I don&#39;t advise using the 
Time Cube or Spheres for now.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Lyle smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;d do it, but I&#39;ve got a date with 
Sensor.&quot;

Brainy paused in the door, &quot;When did that happen?&quot;

&quot;The last time you ducked into the lab for a month,&quot; Lyle chuckled.

&quot;Good point,&quot; Brainy flashed a rare smile and headed out.

Legion World wasn&#39;t quite a planet sized construct, but it at least 
rivaled a good sized moon. The Legion&#39;s technology helped prevent the 
gravitational effects from influencing the solar system, and in addition 
it allowed them to help defend the system from criminal assault. In 
addition it was a hub of transport, overseeing the spacial gates that 
allowed almost instant transit across space.

The command center bustled with activity, all overseen by civilian 
engineer Chuck Taine. Nicknamed &#39;Bouncing boy&#39; due to his weight the 
earth man took it in stride, especially considering his developing 
relationship with Triad

&quot;Mr. Dox,&quot; Chuck nodded respectfully.

&quot;You can call me Braniac,&quot; he reminded him.

&quot;Sorry sir,&quot; Chuck looked flustered.

Deciding not to pursue the point Brainy asked, &quot;Are the inner circle 
back from the meeting with the United Planets yet?&quot;

&quot;Saturn Girl, Cosmic Boy and Lightning Lad should be here shortly,&quot; 
Chuck took note of a schedule posted on one of the many holographic 
displays and continued, &quot;the meeting ran over time a bit, I understand.&quot;

&quot;As always,&quot; Brainy agreed.

While the Legion has had many elected leaders over the years, the three 
founding members carried a greater symbolic weight. That was why they 
had gone to negotiate with the UP, especially considering the team&#39;s 
somewhat mixed relationship with the government. The tension was quite 
understandable, especially when you remembered that the Legion had 
exposed the criminal activities of two past Presidents.

A chime brought Chuck&#39;s eyes to a screen,&quot; Their shuttle&#39;s arriving now, 
sir.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; and Brainy headed off.

In another part of the construct a ragged cry rang out, then there was a 
long moment a silence. Ayla Ranzz lay back with a sigh, the sweaty 
red-blonde woman from Winath smiling as she purred, &quot;It&#39;s days like this 
I wonder why I ran from you so long.&quot;

Salu Digby smiled, the black haired young woman laying beside her lover 
comfortably. &quot;Weren&#39;t you chasing me?&quot; the Imiskan asked curiously, the 
naked women peacefully curled up beside each other.

Ayla stroked her hair, &quot;I think we were chasing each other, Vi.&quot;

Publicly they were Spark and Violet, respected heroines and famous 
figures. Privately they were lovers, though it was something that they 
didn&#39;t hide, either. Their teammates, friends and family knew, the rest 
of it wasn&#39;t an issue to either of them.

Vi cuddled close to Ayla as she added, &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to our visit 
to your family&#39;s ranch on Winath.&quot;

&quot;You must be really looking forward to meeting my parents,&quot; Ayla 
laughed, looking at her lover curiously.

&quot;That too,&quot; Vi said, &quot;but I understand Winath is mostly clothing 
optional.&quot; A grin, &quot;The idea of seeing you unclothed al the time...&quot;

&quot;Pervert,&quot; Ayla laughed, slapping her arm.

&quot;And proud of it,&quot; Vi answered, blushing happily.

&quot;Love you,&quot; Ayla murmured after a moment.

Vi stroked her hair, &quot;Love you, too.&quot;

Brainy was waiting as they disembarked, three figures who were known 
across the UP. Rokk Krinn, known as Cosmic boy, Garth Ranzz, also called 
Lightning Lad and finally Imra Ardeen, the telepath called Saturn girl.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Brainy nodded. He didn&#39;t always see the point of casual 
greetings and interactions, but he had learned that they helped others.

&quot;Hello Brainy,&quot; Imra nodded cheerfully.

&quot;Brainy,&quot; Garth smiled slightly as the reddish-blonde haired man asked 
curiously, &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got an update on the time travel situation,&quot; Brainy said, handing 
over the data pad.

Cosmic Boy took it, the black haired young man quickly scrolling through 
the document before handing it to the others. &quot;Does that mean Kara 
Zor-el can not go back in time to assist her niece, A-ko?&quot; Coz asked.

&quot;We could try,&quot; Brainy conceded the point, &quot;the Time Cube is durable 
enough to survive the temporal flux around the mid-twenty-first century, 
but there would be no guarantee she&#39;d arrive in the correct timeline.&quot;

Garth read the document, blinking. &quot;There&#39;s a risk of the shifting 
realities changing the time traveler?&quot; he asked.

&quot;It&#39;s a remote risk, but yes,&quot; Brainy admitted. &quot;Using the time viewer 
we&#39;ve seen several major reality altering events occurring in the 
twentieth and twenty-first centuries, such as the great Crisis, Zero 
Hour and the second Crisis. If the traveler landed close enough to them 
in time, they might be caught up in the reboot.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have to run it by Kid Quantum,&quot; Imra said, the lovely blonde 
referring to the current team leader, &quot;but I think we&#39;ll need to go with 
your recommendation that we suspend time travel for the time being, at 
least until you can guarantee the travelers safety from time changes.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Brainy nodded. He smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;m working on 
improved versions of the Cube as well, I&#39;ll inform you when they&#39;re 
ready for testing.&quot;

&quot;No manned tests,&quot; Garth needlessly reminded him, &quot;we still don&#39;t know 
if the Time Trapper is lurking around.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Brainy said a bit stiffly as he left.

To be continued...

Notes: This is my attempt to deal with the Legion characters, especially 
since they were featured in Kingdom Come, the basis of part of my future 
DC universe, and had a Supergirl in the team. The Ayla/Vi relationship 
is actually from the first and second series of LSH. It was hinted at in 
the first series, and was revealed early on in the second series. My 
knowledge of Legion is mostly based on that series, rather than the more 
recent ones, since I quit reading the title after various reboots had 
made it almost unreadable.</pre>
