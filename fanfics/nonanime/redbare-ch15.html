I had passed out. My head hurt. I was on my back. She was next to me. 
Bending over me. Asking if I was okay. Her worried face. I cupped her 
cheek. She smiled. Pulled me up and supported me.

It was back to normal. Misty and light. The world. Or maybe not normal. 
Just usual. Usual misery. I sat down. Leaned against the wall. The girl 
would have to do it. Complete the painting.

Half life. Not really there. Lights danced before me. She shook me. The 
girl was done with the painting. Had slept. Sighing. To be dizzy. She 
pulled me up. Straightened my dress. Took my hand and pulled me along.

There was someone. In the shop. I couldn&#39;t focus. No concentration. She 
did it. The girl. We walked past her dad. He couldn&#39;t see us. Out in the 
street. The cop was there. She walked into the shop and we ran.

The girl had changed. She was so much stronger. We ran. Faster than 
ever. Faster than the adults chasing us. Not real humans. They couldn&#39;t 
catch us. Nobody could. Not even him. I smiled. And tripped.

Darkness. The girl dropped to her knees. The howl was distant. But much 
closer to her. She cried out. Covered her ears. Rust. I watched her. Her 
wrinkled face. Staring madly into the darkness. Above her.

Fluttering in the night. In total darkness. It could see us somehow. The 
fake dinosaur. Much larger than the ones before. I thought I was the 
only one who could see. Maybe the girl too. It landed. Hopped closer. 
Stared at the helpless person on the ground who was me. Stared and 
grinned.

The shapeless head was noisy. Not breathing. Something. Slimy sound. It 
moved closer. I could feel its breath. Then it stopped. Just as if I 
wasn&#39;t there. I couldn&#39;t move. Couldn&#39;t breathe. Snapping for air again. 
The girl.

She jumped. Onto its back. Wrapped her arms around its neck. It screamed 
from surprise. Shook its wings. She held on. Squeezed its throat. 
Shouting. I told her to use the knife.

It knocked her off. Send her flying. Crashing into the wall. I cried 
out. It looked at me. Whispered. And attacked. I let it hit me. Beat me. 
Make my arms and legs numb and blue. The more it hurt. The more I 
smiled.

The girl yelled in the distance. The beating stopped. It moved 
frantically. Confused. It couldn&#39;t see me. It turned to the girl. 
Hovered. Screamed and attacked. She waved to me.

I cried. Just as it was about to get her. It turned around and looked at 
me. Frustrated. Angry. It went for me. And the girl called out again. I 
shouted. I shouted as she moved up behind it. Then I stopped.

She spoke softly. I held my breath. Too scared to move. It spun around 
just as she hit it. Right in the face. It made a weird sound. Then it 
fell. Something living that had covered the face. They were crawling 
around on the road. Creeps. Or worms.

And blood. There was blood on the road. There was blood on the knife in 
her hand. She was smart. I wondered why it could only see one of us at 
the time. It was odd. Maybe it was the same with the cop? She saw right 
through me.

The girl wasn&#39;t smiling. I didn&#39;t feel too good. It hurt when she pulled 
me up. Supported me. Helped me. And in a way it felt good. The way she 
held on to me. The way we stumbled around in the darkness. Outside some 
restaurant.

She threw me aside. Evaded the monster as it dived. Tables and chairs 
were tossed around. Smashed. A trail of blood was left behind. It was 
angry. More than before. I crawled into cover under a table.

The headache worsened. The world was so loud. My heart. And my ears. 
Constant beating. Not music. The monster would hear it. I couldn&#39;t find 
the girl.

Too fast. Or too slow. The world was closing in on us. Or me. I couldn&#39;t 
find her. I could call out. But it could hear me. It was silent. But 
there. It was there. Waiting for me.

Darkness. It was suddenly real. I couldn&#39;t see a thing. Blind. Under a 
table. I could feel it. I crawled a bit forward. Closer to the 
restaurant. Under another table. I held my breath. It was there. 
Somewhere. The girl had to kill it.

Monster wings smashed a table. The first one. Where I just came from. I 
let out a whimper. I could hear it hover. The darkness was thick. 
Another table was broken. It would get here.

Sting. My guts hurt. I couldn&#39;t hear it anymore. Didn&#39;t know where it 
was. Headache. Misery. My whole body was aching. So sore. I moved on. 
Splash. A splash. Blood. Someone was bleeding. Someone right on top of 
the table.

I tried to get up. It was stupid. Smashed my head against the table. It 
flipped over. I flipped over. Lying on my back. The monster hovered 
above me. Screaming. The end.
