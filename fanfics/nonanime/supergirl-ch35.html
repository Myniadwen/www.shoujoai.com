<a href="../nonanime/supergirl-ch34.html">Back to Part 34</a><pre>Cylene drew back her power, the blonde amazon smiling
slightly as the command deck of Warworld bustled with
activity. Servant species and Almeracians rushed
about, monitoring the giant, moving battlestation as
it traveled through space towards Sol system.

&quot;Well done, Cylene,&quot; Maxima smiled, the redhead
looking down at her daughter fondly.

&quot;I wish our tools had been more effective,&quot; Cylene
frowned, &quot;but they&#39;ve distracted the League well
enough.&quot;

Maxima moved away to sit in a throne like chair, while
a empty seat beside her waited for Cylene. &quot;Do you
expect the solar system to be defended?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I&#39;ve scanned the data files of the ship that brought
me home to Warworld,&quot; Cylene said as she sat, &quot;there
was no attempt to intercept. However, we were scanned
by locations on Mars and on the outer planets. I
suspect there may be automated systems.&quot;

&quot;What do you recommend we do?&quot; Maxima asked, studying
her daughter.

&quot;Bombard each site as a precaution,&quot; Cylene answered
promptly, &quot;if there IS a enemy force there it&#39;d better
to destroy it now, than risk a surprise later.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Maxima said. She studied her daughter a
moment as her voice softened, &quot;How long have you been
on duty?&quot;

&quot;Nearly twelve hours now,&quot; Cylene admitted before
adding firmly, &quot;but it is of no consequence. There is
still much to do...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Maxima said firmly, &quot;you must rest. You&#39;ll need
your full strength once we reach the human&#39;s defensive
line.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Cylene started.

&quot;Rest,&quot; Maxima repeated, &quot;must I make it an order?&quot;

&quot;All right, mother,&quot; Cylene gave in gracefully. Rising
from her seat she bowed slightly then strode from the
command deck, her simple one piece costume clinging to
her shapely body.

Maxima watched Cylene go, her own thoughts faintly
troubled. &#39;When Cylene addressed the Justice League
she called A-ko beloved,&#39; she mused, &#39;it seems her
feelings for the hero are as strong as ever. I had
best watch, to make sure she doesn&#39;t do anything
foolish.&#39;

&#39;So, to bed,&#39; Cylene thought as she went down the hall
to the teleporting pad, &#39;but first, there are things I
need to check into.&#39; Pressing a few buttons she
entered the location code, stepped on the platform
then was gone.

The section of Warworld she arrived in had been
modified somewhat by it&#39;s inhabitants, and oddly had
the feeling of Japan about it. The denizens of Orando
had modified this place, so that it&#39;s almost rustic
style construction existed, as did the plants so like
cherry trees that spilled soft pink blossoms on the
stones of the walkways.

Walking under a simulated sky Cylene headed to one of
the buildings, gazing in the doorway as she saw the
battle going on within. The redheaded woman fought
against four others, but it was almost as if it was a
game for her. With inhuman speed she defeated one foe
after another, dodging and bobbing between blows,
until finally they all had fallen.

&quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; the redhead turned, smiling slightly.

&quot;Ranko,&quot; Cylene nodded, &quot;I have need of your combat
abilities.&quot;

&quot;A worthy challenge?&quot; Ranko asked, a servant bringing
her a towel to wipe away the sweat. She wore a simple
two piece costume, black pants and a red silk shirt
hugging her curvy form.

&quot;I believe so,&quot; Cylene said. &quot;an Earther called
Kestrel. I will be leading a squad against her allies,
will you join it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d be honored,&quot; Ranko grinned.

&quot;Good,&quot; Cylene smiled, &quot;I&#39;ll enjoy fighting by your
side.&quot; She looked towards the fallen warriors, &quot;Those
women, are they dead?&quot;

&quot;No, but my nerve strikes have paralyzed them,&quot; Ranko
said, &quot;I only kill as needed.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; and with that Cylene excused herself.

Next, Cylene traveled to Starhaven, a section
colonized by Thangaran warriors. The gravity in that
section was low as she soared between the bird winged
warriors, eventually finding herself on a floating
island.

&quot;Lord Talak,&quot; Cylene said with some distaste, &quot;I come
bearing news of the traitor.&quot;

&quot;She survived getting to earth?&quot; the Thangarian
warlord asked, his grey hair falling into his eyes.
Talak was a old man, but strong, having overthrown the
previous rulers of his kind.

&quot;Yes, and she&#39;s allied herself with the Justice
League,&quot; Cylene revealed.

&quot;Traitorous wench,&quot; Talak hissed.

&quot;I intend to lead a warrior elite against them,&quot;
Cylene said, &quot;I would like a champion of Thangar to
face Katar.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Talak nodded then looked off into the distance,
a smile teased his lips.

&quot;What?&quot; Cylene pressed.

&quot;There is a warrior and tracker called Dawnstar who
was once... intimate with Katar,&quot; Talak revealed, &quot;she
would be perfect for your elite.&quot;

&quot;But would she be swayed by her feelings?&quot; Cylene
asked.

&quot;She is a warrior of Thangar,&quot; Talak said firmly, &quot;she
will do her duty.&quot;

Excusing herself Cylene traveled back to the teleport
system, journeying to another section of Warworld. The
landscape here resembled that of a biblical hell,
fires burning uncontrollably and the air filled with
rude gasses. The people here were from Apokolips, and
had made this place a reflection of their former home.
Meeting with Grayven, son of Darkseid, Cylene was told
of a warrior whom she next sought out.

There was a sound of whip&#39;s cracking as the black
haired woman stuck, the leather lash biting into stone
like it was paper. Dressed in black the woman&#39;s
costume was covered with strips of leather, each one a
deadly weapon on her hands.

&quot;Hello, Lashina,&quot; Cylene said.

Lashina smiled, the leather on her mask giving her a
demented look, &quot;Lady Cylene,&quot; she purred, &quot;did your
Injustice gang fail as I predicted?&quot;

Cylene grit her teeth, fighting back her annoyance,
&quot;Yes they did, Duchess.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t call me that,&quot; Lashina snarled, furious over
the reminder of her past. Exiled from Apokolips on
Earth she had joined the Suicide Squad, eventually
using the team to get herself home and punish her
foes. Still, she hated to be reminded of her time
consorting with lesser beings such as humans.

&quot;I need a warrior, a killer to fight beside my Elite,&quot;
Cylene said, dropping her taunting of the other woman
for the moment.

&quot;I&#39;m always ready to kill,&quot; Lashina purred.

&quot;But A-ko is MINE,&quot; Cylene warned.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Lashina smirked.

Wheeling about Cylene grabbed her by the throat and
hammered her against a wall. &quot;Don&#39;t toy with me,
slut,&quot; she growled.

&quot;I&#39;m... sorry,&quot; Lashina croaked weakly.

Cylene let her go, &quot;Do not forget who has the power
her.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; Lashina rubbed at her throat, glaring at
Cylene as she left.

Feeling weariness overtaking her Cylene sighed,
deciding she had done enough recruiting for today.
&#39;Besides,&#39; she thought as she left the hellish region,
&#39;there&#39;s always tomorrow.&#39;

To be continued...

Notes: Yes, Ranko is a thinly disguised Ranma. Her
&quot;world&quot; is a Legion of Super Heroes reference, as is
the Dawnstar of Thangar. :)</pre>
