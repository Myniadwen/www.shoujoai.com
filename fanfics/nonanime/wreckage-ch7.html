<h1>Avengers: Wreckage (part 7 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/wreckage-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The beautiful blonde frowned as the last of her
servants reappeared in her sanctum, the busy movie
studio now eerily quiet as the last young man unloaded
his bag full of jewels. Decorated like the hall of
some lost king it glittered with gold and fine cloths,
a lovely illusion.

&quot;Lady Amora,&quot; he bowed respectfully, &quot;we would have
brought you more except for the interference of those
heroes.&quot;

Amora of Asgard, called by some the Enchantress,
sighed as she studied the magically generated image
that was floating in the air, her light green dress
hugging her body closely. Her blue eyes were narrowed
in thought as she said, &quot;I still find it hard to
believe that they could defeat all my trolls so
easily.&quot;

All the young men who worked for her were almost
unearthly beautiful, professional models that vainly
tried to match their mistress&#39; beauty. &quot;They are
powerful,&quot; the black haired man noted, his suit crisp
and neat, &quot;and they seem to have an Asgardian with
them.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Amora nodded as she focused on the image of
Thunderstrike. Shaking herself she commanded the men,
&quot;Leave me, I must think.&quot;

&quot;Of course, m&#39;lady,&quot; the redheaded man bowed to her
formally as he lead the others from the room
obediently.

Amora looked at the familiar armor and weapon that
Thunderstrike carried and felt a pang of grief.
Ragnarok, the end of the gods had finally come and
Asgard was no more... the Giants, Dark Elves and other
ancient foes had finally destroyed the golden realm.
She herself had only escaped by leaving a false copy
of herself there, fighting beside Asgard while she had
quietly escaped to Earth with all the resources she
could carry. She had thought all that remained of
Asgard were her trolls, servants and a few artifacts
so it was faintly shocking to see Thunderstrike in all
her glory.

Her decision to settle here in Hollywood was an easy
one, of course. Amora was a mistress of illusion, a
thing that gave one great power here, and she still
retained connections from her time here many years
ago. She had recruited the Wrecking Crew by tracing
the Asgardian magic on them, convincing the fools that
her magic was needed to keep their powers, and she had
put her staple of boy-toys together almost as easily.

&#39;So why am I not content?&#39; Amora thought bleakly.

Once again Amora found her gaze drawn towards
Thunderstrike&#39;s image, looking at the black haired
young woman dressed in chainmail, her silvery head
dress and intense, narrowed eyes. Her face was
beautiful, almost noble in her manner and focus, and
the body concealed beneath the Asgardian garb was
lovely.

Amora shook herself, feeling faintly annoyed. She got
up from her throne and strode from the giant room, her
golden mane flowing like a cape behind her. One of her
many staff members, all of them interchangeable to
her, nodded a greeting. &quot;I&#39;m going out,&quot; she said
flatly, &quot;have my secretary hold my calls.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; he nodded respectfully as she strode by.

The cherry red sports car waited in it&#39;s usual place
and Amora got in, peeling out of the lot with a squeal
of tires. She drove fast, pushing the speed limit till
she hit a empty street then floored it. Suddenly,
sirens wailed not far behind her, red and blue lights
flashing behind her.

&quot;Guess it wasn&#39;t as empty as I thought,&quot; Amora
murmured as she pulled over. A cruiser pulled over as
Amora undid a button on the front of her dress,
letting a bit of cleavage show as she waited for the
officer to arrive. The sound of footsteps then she
looked up, faintly surprised to see a redheaded woman
looking down at her.

Sunglasses concealed Officer O&#39;connel&#39;s eyes, her cap
straight and neat as she looked down at the blonde
beauty. &quot;Do you know how fast you were going?&quot; she
asked wryly, wondering if she&#39;d pulled over another
actress.

Amora felt a bit of disappointment at it being a
woman, then noticed how her gaze seemed to be drawn to
her breasts. &#39;Interesting,&#39; Amora fought back a smile.
&quot;No, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t know,&quot; she purred innocently
even as she released a bit of magic.

The officer took off her glasses, revealing striking
green eyes. She blinked a few times. a faint blush
coloring her cheeks but she tried to stay business
like, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say you were well over the speed
limit, miss.&quot;

Amora took a breath, her breasts rising and falling as
she sighed, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Miss...?&quot;

&quot;Sean,&quot; the redheaded officer blushed, surprised at
the tingle of lust she felt gazing at the lady&#39;s full,
perfect breasts.

&quot;Sean,&quot; Amora put a hand on her arm, rubbing back and
forth like petting a cat, &quot;do you think you could
forgive me... just this once?&quot;

&quot;I.. I shouldn&#39;t,&quot; Sean stammered huskily.

&quot;Please?&quot; Amora purred in a bedroom voice.

Sean gulped loudly, seemingly lost in her eyes.
&quot;Just... don&#39;t do it again,.&quot; she managed softly.

After thinking about it a second Amora reached into a
pocket and handed Sean a business card. &quot;Call me,&quot; she
said, her look promising a great deal.

&quot;I&#39;ll do that,&quot; Sean stepped back as Amora drove away.

&#39;Nice to know I still have it,&#39; Amora thought as she
drove, smiling. She had been called the Enchantress
not just because of her magic, but also for her
seductive gifts. She had targeted and claimed may men
over the years, many heroes and villains, but each
time there was a new thrill to be had or a new
challenge. She had rarely turned her gifts on her own
gender, though... and her encounter with Sean had
sparked a certain hunger.

There were few in this human world that Amora would
consider worthy of her... she had dallied with the
hero Wonder Man, there were a few others but that was
all. But Thunderstike... even if she was a moral woman
she carried a Asgardian essence within her. She might
very well be worthy of Amora.. not to mention being a
interesting challenge.

Smoothly Amora pulled her sports car in front of the
restaurant and climbed out, striding by the line
waiting to get in. The waiter guided her to a table
and Amora nodded to the older man sitting at a corner
table. &quot;Mr. Stark,&quot; she nodded.

Morgan Stark nodded, his black hair messy and his suit
a bit wrinkled. He had fallen a long way from being
one of those Starks, a potential heir to the company.
Now he was a middleman, helping arrange certain
semi-legal actions by third parties. &quot;The Wrecker
wants to know how long you want him under wraps?&quot; he
asked flatly.

&quot;The heat needs to die down more,&quot; Amora said as she
sat. She grimaced, &quot;Especially since he called on my
magic in front of those heroes.&quot;

&quot;That matters?&quot; Morgan looked curious.

&quot;Thunderstrike&#39;s mace is a wild card,&quot; Amora said
simply, &quot;it&#39;s quite possible she could trace me back
by my magical signature.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pass that onto Thunderball,&quot; Morgan nodded, &quot;he
can figure out how to tell Wrecker so he&#39;ll
understand.&quot; Thunderball was a former scientist before
joining the wrecking crew, so he would likely
understand Amora and know how to convince his somewhat
dimmer comrades.

&quot;Good,&quot; Amora nodded, &quot;I noticed that the Raiders have
been lying low?&quot;

&quot;The armored battlesuits they use are good,&quot; Morgan
said with a shrug, &quot;but with the new Stane heroes
running around they&#39;re understandably nervous.&quot;

Amora leaned forward to give Morgan a dangerous look,
&quot;They owe me, Morgan, they&#39;d better pay me back...&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll do it,&quot; Morgan held up a calming hand, &quot;just
give them a bit of time.&quot;

&quot;Hmph,&quot; Amora shook her head.

Morgan took out a personal organizer. &quot;We&#39;ve got
several independent operators looking to set up shop
in the city Boss,&quot; he passed the device over to Amora.

&quot;Sakura and Feral...&quot; Amora raised a eyebrow in
question, &quot;I thought those assassins lived and worked
in Asia?&quot;

&quot;Maybe they&#39;re tired of sushi?&quot; Morgan shrugged.

&quot;Let them know they can come, but reject the rest
politely,&quot; Amora passed the organizer over, &quot;we need
to keep the supervillain activity in town under
control.&quot;

&quot;So we don&#39;t draw more superheroes,&quot; Morgan nodded
wisely. He looked curious, &quot;So why let Feral and
Sakura operate here?&quot;

&quot;Because,&quot; Amora smiled coldly, &quot;you can always use
assassins.&quot;

&quot;Do you need anything else?&quot; Morgan asked, He smiled
slightly, &quot;I still need to go pay off Ultra Girl to
leave our operations alone.&quot;

&quot;Go to it,&quot; Amora dismissed him before waving down a
waiter and ordering.

To be continued...

Notes: Amora the Enchantress is a long tome Thor and
Avengers villain. Morgan Stark has been a pain in the
ass to Tony for years, plotting to get hold of his
company. Finally, Feral and Sakura are from my older
fic, Adventures of Shadowcat and Rogue.</pre>
