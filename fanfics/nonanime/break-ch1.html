<h1>Break Shadow (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The crowd parted almost naturally, without even thinking, as a woman 
led by a massive dog walked in the other direction.  A strip of dark 
red cloth was tied around her head, covering her obvious blind eyes, 
and keeping her short, shaggily cut black hair from her face.  The dog 
was just as shaggy as its master, massive enough for the woman to rest 
her hand on its back without the slightest bend in her back.  The woman 
herself was tall, slim, and most would exaggerate that she was as 
skinny as the strange stick on her back.  Her clothes were long, 
slightly ragged, and all black.

The strange stick looked slightly curved and almost looked as though it 
bore a hilt with a bloody gem embedded in the base.  However, a second 
glance showed that it was a stick, and nothing more.  No one really 
gave the woman a second look, and she let the massive beast guide her 
to a dock.  Her unseeing gaze turned towards the bay, where sunlight 
glanced off clear waters and shadows fell from a peculiar tower.

&quot;If I may ask, sir,&quot; the woman spoke suddenly.  The touring man in a 
loud Hawaiian shirt jumped in shock.  He hadn&#39;t thought the woman had 
noticed him walk up next to her.

&quot;Well, sure,&quot; he replied, more than a bit surprised.  His pudgy hands 
were clamped around a huge camera, aimed towards the T-shaped tower.  
&quot;What do you need to know?&quot;

&quot;What city am I in?&quot; the woman asked.  &quot;What am I looking at right 
now?&quot;

&quot;Well, we&#39;re in Black City,&quot; the man answered.  &quot;We&#39;re looking at 
Titan&#39;s Tower, where the Teen Titans are.&quot;

&quot;Teen Titans?&quot; the woman didn&#39;t seem as confused as the man originally 
believed.  &quot;Who are they?  Certainly not the creatures of myth.&quot;  The 
man thought he heard her whisper to herself, &quot;I&#39;ve killed almost all of 
them myself,&quot; but shrugged it off.

&quot;No, they&#39;re superheroes,&quot; the man laughed, rubbing the back of his 
head genially.  &quot;You haven&#39;t heard of them?  There&#39;s Robin, Beast Boy, 
Cyborg, Starfire, and Raven.&quot;  The woman visibly stiffened, head rising 
suddenly.

&quot;The last one you said,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;The Raven.  A girl?  Do you 
mean a girl with dark powers?  Is that the Raven of which you speak?&quot;  
The man was thoroughly bemused.  The woman acted like she had no idea 
of what he was talking about, but described Raven to the hilt.  Well, 
as best one could describe the nearly silent and shadow-hidden 
sorceress.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; he blinked.  &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s Raven all right.  Do you know her?&quot;  
The woman did not reply.  From nowhere and nothing, the ground rumbled 
and the sky echoed an explosion.  Screams rose up to greet those sudden 
sounds, and the tourist jumped in shock, his cream white fisherman&#39;s 
hat falling from his sweaty, bald head.

&quot;Someone&#39;s robbing the bank!&quot; a scream rang out.  &quot;Someone call for 
help!&quot;

&quot;Well, this might be your chance to meet with Raven,&quot; the man said, 
eyes wide in shock and alarm.  The woman turned about, the dog 
faithfully at her side.  The dog looked up at her with impossible red 
eyes, and the two began to walk away.  The man jerked in amazement.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to try and go there!&quot; he shouted.  &quot;You&#39;ll 
get yourself killed!  Leave the heroic stuff to the heroes!&quot;  The woman 
turned on heel and smiled briefly, almost sadly.

&quot;I&#39;m going to find a very old friend of mine,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;If I 
have to go where a battle is to see her, then so be it.  Don&#39;t worry 
about me.&quot;  The dog began to walk away swiftly, guiding the woman away.  
The tourist just stared in shock.  When she rounded a corner and 
vanished, the man forgot that he had ever seen her, ever spoken to her, 
or ever even glanced sideways at her.  She was gone from his memory.

----------

&quot;Get ready for the big bang, baby!&quot;  The Titans barely had time to 
scatter before an explosion tore another vast hole into the ground.  
The brothers Bada and Boom, most creatively named for their use of 
gunpowder and flamethrowers, were standing outside the first bank of 
Black City to confront the Teen Titans.  A hole was blasted in the side 
of the building, and a highly compressed orb of powder sat near the 
vault.

&quot;Starfire, wait!&quot; Robin called, holding up a hand to stay the coming 
blast.  &quot;If you hit them, they might blow up!&quot;  Starfire calmed the 
blaze in her hands, eyes worried.  The team stood still, thinking 
desperately of something that could stave off any further explosions.  
Bada and Boom laughed uproariously at their near-assured victory, 
turning towards the bank once more.

&quot;Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos!&quot;  The words hung in the air as wicked 
shadows swallowed the explosive near the vault door.  Raven, resident 
sorceress of Black City, caught the volatile sphere and gave the 
brothers the same look she gave everyone.  Raven felt no compassion for 
the world around her, and the coldness was reflected in her dark eyes.  
So far, the only time she had truly shown any emotion was within the 
confines of her meditation mirror.  Of course, that was because those 
forms of herself were simply pure emotion, so it could not be helped.

Despite the fact that they had just lost their exploding ball, Bada and 
Boom grinned.  Boom, the lankier of the brothers and wielder of 
flamethrowers, aimed at Raven swiftly and shot a volley of searing fire 
towards her.  Raven reacted quickly, but was unprepared for what would 
happen from those actions.  She threw the explosive away and leapt 
back, arms coming up to guard what they could.

The explosion tore the street apart from one sidewalk to the next.  
Raven felt the heat rip her pale flesh and grimaced in pain.  Her hands 
steamed and bleed, blisters appearing almost instantly from the heat.  
The occurring force threw her through the air and the girl didn&#39;t even 
want to think about how hard she was going to hit the wall.

Rather abruptly, she stopped, someone&#39;s arms around her.  Raven turned 
to thank whatever teammate had kept her from crashing into a wall and 
paused.  She had to think, but she knew she had seen that face hidden 
behind red cloth before.  The person, a woman, smiled at her and set 
her on her feet before turning to look blindly at the brothers.

&quot;Children shouldn&#39;t play with fire,&quot; she snickered to herself, reaching 
over her shoulder and pulling at the strange stick strapped to her 
back.  Light flashed off a gleaming silver blade and the blind woman 
stood calmly before the villains.  The brothers laughed heartily at the 
woman, knees buckling.

&quot;So what are you going to do about it?&quot; Bada shouted at her.  &quot;How&#39;re 
you supposed to even try and fight us?&quot;  The woman smiled back, her 
body surprisingly loose despite holding such an obviously sharp blade.  
Bada was suddenly pulled down by something, the barrel of gunpowder on 
his back smashing against the sidewalk.

&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; the man shouted.  He choked as water doused him and the 
fallen gunpowder, ruining what remaining explosive there was left.  
Bada cursed angrily and stood up, shaking himself to get the water 
away.  A cat purred somewhere at his ankles, and he looked down.  A 
small housecat made entirely of water circled his legs, staring up at 
him with strange, clear eyes.

&quot;What the hell?&quot; Bada stammered, shaking his head in confusion.  &quot;What 
are you?&quot;  The cat smiled, though it was impossible, and suddenly grew 
in size, becoming a terrible wildcat that leered at the man.  He took a 
step back, and the cat circled around him, stretching to ridiculous 
lengths and surrounding him easily.

&quot;What is this?&quot; he demanded.  &quot;Get away from me!  What are you?&quot;  The 
cat let out a howl that echoed in the eerie silence of the battle, and 
it melted away to a formless orb that contained the man.  The woman 
holding the sword smiled again and snapped her fingers.  A tremendous 
serpent appeared at her feet, lashing out a forked tongue.  It 
slithered its ice-made body over the ground and struck the water, 
freezing the liquid and criminal within.

Bada had a look of absolute terror on his face, frozen by the ice.  His 
brother turned towards the woman, who stood with a smile on her face.  
His eyes were brimming with tears of hatred, rage, and he took a 
shaking aim at her.

&quot;You bitch!&quot; he screamed.  &quot;I&#39;ll kill you!  I&#39;ll kill you dead!&quot;  Boom 
sent a massive wall of flame at her, and grinned when she vanished in 
the searing fire.  The Titans drew a collective gasp, and Raven stared 
in horror at what happened.  Boom ended the blast and began to laugh 
wickedly as the smoke settled slowly.  He turned on the heroes.

&quot;Now I&#39;m going to barbeque you freaks!&quot; he shrieked.  His laughter grew 
louder, near maddening as he took aim once again.

&quot;Did you honestly think I was dead?&quot;

The voice rang out from the smoke and ash.  All turned towards it.  
Steps sounded in the silence, and the glistening blade appeared from 
the black, smoldering cinders.  The woman stepped into the light, still 
smiling, sword held loosely at her side.  Boom snarled, baring his 
teeth as a bead of cold sweat rolled down his face.

&quot;I came here to find someone that I left eight years ago,&quot; the woman 
chuckled.  &quot;Your pathetic traps aren&#39;t going to stop me from finding 
her.  So unless you want me to defeat you like I did your companion, 
then I advise you stop whatever you&#39;ve decided to do.&quot;  Boom&#39;s eyes 
widened in fear, muscles tense.

&quot;You&#39;re just a blind freak!&quot; he cried.  The woman laughed mirthlessly, 
walking slowly towards Boom.

&quot;I may be blind, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t win,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;Do 
you know why you can&#39;t defeat me?  I&#39;m blind, but I&#39;m a demon.  Demons 
don&#39;t lose to humans.&quot;  Boom&#39;s hands shook, and he sent more flames 
from his weapons.  The woman spun on heel, sword coming up and cutting 
through the fire.  Her movements were fluid, at ease and swift.  
Something flashed around the blade, and the red fire was blown away as 
black flames surrounded the sword.

The woman rushed forwards through the horizontal pillars of fire and 
leapt up.  She cut through the lines that fed fuel to the flamethrowers 
and the blaze stopped instantly.  Boom cowered as the woman turned 
slightly, flipped the sword in her hands, and swung.  The dull edge of 
the one-sided sword hit Boom full in the ribs and he coughed sharply.  
He fell to the ground, unconscious.  The battle was over.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Starfire said softly.  &quot;That was...&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Cyborg murmured.  The woman spun the sword in hand and slid it 
cleanly and easily into its sheath on her back.  The dog, which had 
been standing almost faithfully at Raven&#39;s side, barked once at the 
woman.  She turned immediately, gaze turned towards the sorceress.

&quot;Your hands,&quot; she called to the girl.  Raven almost jumped at the 
sudden words.  She looked at her burnt hands and found them shaking 
from pain and amazement.  &quot;Are they hurt badly?  I can smell the 
blood.&quot;  When Raven gave no reply, the woman began to walk across the 
damaged street, avoiding the areas that burned and were now holes.  She 
stopped a few feet before Raven, her hands carefully reaching for the 
girl.

&quot;I suppose I should have run a bit faster,&quot; she said with a faint 
chuckle.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get here before they decided to try and 
blow you up.&quot;  Her long fingers took hold of Raven&#39;s wrists gently and 
she lifted the bleeding hands.  She twitched her head and the cat made 
of water appeared, standing on the woman&#39;s arm.  It sniffed at Raven&#39;s 
hands and turned to formless, cool liquid.  It surrounded the 
sorceress&#39; hands and remained there without moving.

&quot;Sorry again, whoever you might be,&quot; the woman chuckled again.  &quot;I hate 
to be so impertinent, but I&#39;m looking for someone.  Do you know where I 
might find the Teen Titans?  I&#39;m looking for Raven.&quot;

&quot;Well, you sure found us,&quot; Robin laughed.  &quot;We&#39;re the Titans.  You just 
helped us beat a couple of criminals.  And the girl you&#39;re talking to 
is Raven.&quot;  The woman&#39;s head twisted slightly in shock and she turned 
blindly to Raven.

&quot;Is that really you, Raven?&quot; she asked with a smile.  &quot;You have to say 
something or I won&#39;t know.  I&#39;m blind, remember?&quot;  Raven swallowed hard 
and took a deep breath.

&quot;It&#39;s me,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;It&#39;s me.  Why are you here?  Why are you 
looking for me?  You were part of my life for eight straight years, 
Chaos, and you just left.  Why are you here now?&quot;  The woman chuckled 
slightly, shaking her head.

&quot;I have a lot to apologize for,&quot; she, Chaos, murmured.  &quot;I don&#39;t think 
I should have vanished without a goodbye, but I had to.  Sorry about 
that, and about not getting here before you were burned.  I have one 
last thing to apologize for, but I won&#39;t mean it.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Raven questioned.  Chaos smiled, bent down, and kissed 
Raven gently.  Raven jerked in response, but found herself unable to 
break the kiss.  After a long moment, Chaos stood straight again.  
Raven stared in shock at the sudden touch.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Chaos shook her head with a smirk.  &quot;But I don&#39;t mean that.&quot;
