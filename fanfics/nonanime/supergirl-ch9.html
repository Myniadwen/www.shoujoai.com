<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 9 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/supergirl-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre> Kestrel had to smile, holding on to Steel&#39;s back as they soared across 
the city. &quot;You handled yourself well against them,&quot; she said to B- ko, 
adding much more softly, &quot;and you certainly fill out that uniform well.&quot;

B-ko tried to see if she was being serious, but she couldn&#39;t get a good 
look at the woman&#39;s face. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she managed.

&quot;I like a woman who takes charge,&quot; Kestrel mused, adding impishly &quot;it 
makes for a nice change of pace.&quot;

Before B-ko could even try to form a response to that, Oracle&#39;s voice 
came over the communicators. &quot;The situation is as bad as Chief Sawyer 
said,&quot; she reported. The Lexcorp tower loomed above them, and the four 
of them set down in front of it.

&quot;You can&#39;t get in at all?&quot; A-ko asked Oracle.

&quot;Oh, I can get in,&quot; Oracle said, &quot;but the AI keeps rerouting me and 
hitting me with firewalls and anti-viral measures.&quot;

&quot;So we take out the AI,&quot; Kestrel said. &quot;Once it&#39;s out, I&#39;m sure Oracle 
can shut the security systems down easily.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t be able to contact you once you&#39;re inside the building,&quot; Oracle 
noted, &quot;but D-ko can help you in there.&quot;

&quot;Mecha,&quot; D-ko corrected her.

&quot;Nice code name,&quot; Oracle noted. &quot;If Mecha connects to the computer 
systems through non-essential systems, she should be able to call up 
schematics and other data for you.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s also people in there,&quot; A-ko noted. &quot;What do we want to do about 
them?&quot; she asked.

&quot;We&#39;ll do it JLA style,&quot; Kestrel smiled, &quot;we&#39;ll break into teams. Mecha, 
Supergirl, you go after the AI. You two are best equipped to handle it, 
I think. Steel and I will try to track down and civilians and get them 
out.&quot;

B-ko loaded a single missile into her gauntlet launcher, and fired it 
straight up. If flew a few moments, then concealed laser cannons cut it 
to ribbons. &quot;There goes the easy way,&quot; Steel shrugged. She loaded 
another missile, aimed it at the front doors, and blew them away.

The four charged inside, Mecha quickly spotting a computer terminal. She 
popped an adapter cable from her hand, plugged in and began to scroll 
through the sub-directories. &quot;The AI is three levels underground,&quot; she 
reported, &quot;and surrounded by battledroids. The only people are on the 
executive level, the top floors. More battledroids are roaming the 
various levels.&quot;

A-ko walked over to a staircase marked &#39;down&#39; and pushed the door open. 
Supergirl nodded to Mecha, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

&quot;A-ko?&quot; B-ko called out, and the redhead turned to look at her. &quot;Don&#39;t 
get yourself killed,&quot; Steel smiled, &quot;I haven&#39;t beaten you yet.&quot; 
Supergirl gave her a cheerful wave, and was gone.

Kestrel walked to the &#39;up&#39; stairway, but B-ko shook her head. &quot;So what&#39;s 
your plan?&quot; Kestrel asked her.

Steel walked over to the elevator shaft and blew the doors off. &quot;Going 
up?&quot; B-ko asked Kestrel with a little smile.

&quot;You&#39;ve got style, I&#39;ll give you that,&quot; Kestrel grinned.

B-ko helped Kestrel up on her back again, and they flew up the elevator 
shaft. Laser cannons popped up from the walls, but Kestrel had throwing 
disks ready, and whatever she missed Steel finished off. The rose 
swiftly, the levels flying by them.

&quot;Did you mean what you said, when we were flying here?&quot; B-ko asked her 
quietly.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Kestrel smiled.

&quot;So you&#39;re a ..&quot; B-ko trailed off nervously.

Kestrel laughed softly, &quot;Yes. Didn&#39;t Oracle tell you two?&quot;

&quot;She must have forgotten,&quot; B-ko said dryly.

Far bellow them, A-ko was laughing as she charged another swarm of 
battledroids. Mecha winced as she watched her easily tear the robots 
apart, arms and legs flying by her. &quot;Are you finished playing yet?&quot; D-ko 
asked dryly.

Supergirl dusted her hands off, &quot;You know, you even sound like your 
creator.&quot;

Deciding to just ignore that comment, Mecha stepped forward and opened 
up the large, electronic keyed door in front of them before A-ko could 
just break it down. She took a peek inside, &quot;There&#39;s more battledroids.&quot;

&quot;Fun,&quot; Supergirl cracked her knuckles eagerly.

Mecha sighed, and despite being a robot, she sweatdropped.

Back upstairs, and Steel was scanning the hallway ahead of them. Kestrel 
looked at the pile of destroyed battledroids, shaking her head, &quot;Who 
designed this security system, a psychopath?&quot;

&quot;Lex Luthor,&quot; B-ko said coolly, &quot;so you&#39;re probably right.&quot; A moment, 
&quot;There&#39;s more droids ahead of us, and a cluster of human lifesigns.&quot;

Kestrel began to pull a few larger disk shaped devices from her belt, 
&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you aren&#39;t running away from me, after what I told 
you.&quot;

Am odd little smile tugged at B-ko&#39;s lips, &quot;Remind me to tell you about 
the girl that A-ko and I&#39;ve spent the last few years fighting over.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Kestrel nodded. She and Steel turned a corner and saw the cluster 
of battledroids. Without even thinking about it, they charged right into 
the middle of them. Kestrel slapped a disk on one&#39;s chest, then jumped 
away, &quot;Three... two.. one!&quot;

Ka-boom! The chest plate blew right out the back of the robot&#39;s trunk, 
and it collapsed to the floor in a smoking heap.

&quot;Shaped charges, right?&quot; B-ko asked her as she cut one droid down, and 
missile shot another right in the head.

&quot;Always be prepared,&quot; a smiling Kestrel shrugged. She punched another 
droid, and B-ko blinked in surprise.

&#39;She dented steel?&#39; B-ko thought. Her moment&#39;s distraction cost her, as 
a battledroid hammered Steel&#39;s faceplate. The dense plastic shattered, 
pieces falling to the floor. She staggered backwards, and cut the droid 
down with a single blow.

They heard the sound of a door opening, even as Kestrel quickly tried to 
reach the shaken B-ko&#39;s side. There was a loud buzzing noise, and a 
droid was cut down by a laser bolt! Then another and another one fell.

They turned to see a redheaded business woman leading a group of 
employees down the hallway, comfortably carrying a very big gun. &quot;Are 
you two all right?&quot; Lena Luthor asked, then she froze upon seeing B-ko&#39;s 
exposed face.

B-ko quickly scooped up the broken pieces of her faceplate and pressed 
them back into place. A burst of electricity, and the plastics had 
bonded with the rest of the helmet. &quot;We&#39;re fine,&quot; Steel said quietly, 
&quot;though I thought we were supposed to be rescuing you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never been one to wait to be rescued,&quot; Lena was still looking at 
B-ko oddly.

&quot;More battledroids,&quot; Kestrel said calmly, tossing a pair of throwing 
disks into the two droids optic ports. They dropped, but more came up 
behind them.

&#39;Just too many of them,&quot; B-ko thought even as she lay down a wave of 
missile fire to keep them back. &#39;What are you doing down there, A-ko?&quot; 
she wondered.

Down in the main computer room, A-ko hammered another droid away from 
her. Her costume was singed, and soot smudged her face. Mecha trailed 
along beside her, one arm hanging limp, completely inoperative.

&quot;Where do I hit?&quot; Supergirl asked, looking around her wildly at all the 
banks and consoles.

&quot;They&#39;re interlinked,&quot; Mecha scanned quickly, &quot;hit any of them.&quot;

A-ko grinned, and promptly began smashing computer banks.

Upstairs, Lena brought her cannon up to fire again, when the robots 
slowed, then came to a sudden stop. &quot;Looks like Supergirl made it,&quot; 
Kestrel casually kicked a droid&#39;s arm aside.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Lena nodded. She looked searchingly at the helmeted Steel for 
a moment, then turned to her staff, &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;

Not long afterward, and the four were preparing to leave when a hand 
gently rested on Steel&#39;s shoulder. B-ko turned to see who it belonged 
to, and Lena smiled tentatively. &quot;Could I talk to you a moment?&quot; she 
asked quietly.

B-ko turned to Supergirl, Kestrel, and Mecha, &quot;I&#39;ll meet you up on the 
Watchtower.&quot;

Kestrel, especially, looked like she wanted to argue that, but the three 
of them soon had disappeared, teleported away from there. Steel and Lena 
walked over to what was left of the building&#39;s front doors, standing in 
the shade.

&quot;Is that you, Alexis?&quot; Lena asked her quietly.

&quot;Father changed it,&quot; B-ko didn&#39;t even deny it, &quot;I&#39;m B-ko now.&quot;

&quot;If my father could see you now, he&#39;d be spinning in his grave,&quot; Lena 
smiled wryly.

Dryly, B-ko answered, &quot;I&#39;m so glad.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t want to see you,&quot; Lena burst out, &quot;but your 
Father made it a condition of the divorce settlement.&quot;

&quot;Maybe so,&quot; B-ko answered quietly, &quot;but why haven&#39;t you tried to see me 
now that I&#39;ve grown up a bit, Mom?&quot;

Lena hesitated, finally admitting, &quot;I was afraid.&quot;

B-ko looked in her Mother&#39;s eyes trying to read the sincerity there. 
Finally she said, &quot;Call me, I keep my number listed.&quot; She took a few 
steps, and teleported away.</pre>
