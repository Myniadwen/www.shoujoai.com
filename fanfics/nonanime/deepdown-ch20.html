	Setsuna stifled a yawn as she poured another cup of tea.  Once 
finished, she gathered the cup onto a saucer into her hands and leaned 
back into the couch, crossing her legs and taking a brief sip.  Her 
magenta eyes discreetly examined the woman sitting next to her, smiling 
inwardly and quite nearly outwardly at the feelings that welled up just 
by looking.  Everything seemed to be so much more magnified now that the 
two women had confessed their feelings toward one another: the touches, 
the glances, the mere presence of the other&#39;s warm body...

	The dark haired woman closed her eyes, taking a small breath and 
releasing it slowly; she had to calm herself otherwise she&#39;d be taking 
the doctor and matters into her own hands, something Hitomi expressed 
she wasn&#39;t quite ready for yet.

	&quot;I should have called before coming.&quot;

	Magenta eyes looked over into Hitomi&#39;s night blues, the tall woman 
tilted her head with a soft smile caressing her dark skinned face.  &quot;You 
are free to visit whenever you&#39;d like.  I&#39;m rather glad you came over.&quot;

	Hitomi&#39;s face became a wash of relief; it seemed she&#39;d been 
holding her breath, tensely waiting for any backlash.  A small chuckle 
escaped Setsuna&#39;s lips and she leaned forward, setting the tea cup down 
on the coffee table and sitting back, turning her body so that she faced 
the small doctor.

	&quot;What&#39;s on your mind?&quot;  Setsuna&#39;s voice was gentle and she 
smoothly raised her hand, pushing a strand of blue hair behind the other 
woman&#39;s ear.

	The older Mizuno blushed, though smiled at the touch, her 
shoulders visibly became relaxed and she turned in her seat as well, 
bending her left knee so that she was facing the tall, elegant woman.  
&quot;I just... I just had this feeling that I missed you.&quot;  She reached up, 
taking Setsuna&#39;s hand-which had yet to leave her cheek-and clasped it 
between her own.

	Upon hearing this, the dark haired woman&#39;s smile became larger and 
enigmatic, as though she was a child who&#39;d just been given a special 
present.  She lovingly looked down at her hand now entwined between the 
blue haired woman&#39;s strong, but gentle and exacting hands, feeling those 
urges of desire she&#39;d kept down for so long fighting to break free.  
Setsuna blinked several times, telling herself she&#39;d get to those urges 
eventually and that she&#39;d be happy that she managed to restrain herself 
until that point.

	Hoping to diminish those desires, the taller woman lifted her gaze 
back up at the other woman&#39;s face and was slightly startled to find a 
slight frown on it.  Setsuna squeezed the hand that was in her own and 
watched as the other woman&#39;s eyes became more clear and sharp.  The 
doctor smiled apologetically and tightened her grasp.

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she began.  The magenta-eyed woman was about to cut 
her off, saying that it wasn&#39;t necessary, but Hitomi continued on, &quot;That 
wasn&#39;t entirely honest... I did have this feeling that I missed you.  
But...&quot;  There were many pauses and some hesitation as she spoke; 
Setsuna felt the sympathy pour out of her like a broken faucet and she 
scooted forward, resting her free hand on the blue haired woman&#39;s 
shoulder, pressing down gently.

	Hitomi nodded, addressing the contact with another smile and 
carried on after a deep breath, &quot;You&#39;d think I&#39;d be used to not having 
Ami-chan around all of the time, but when I woke this morning, it just 
seemed oddly empty without her there... Forgive me Setsuna, I must admit 
that was probably the driving reason I came over here at such an early 
hour.&quot;

	Releasing a small breath the dark skinned woman hadn&#39;t realized 
she&#39;d been holding, she graced the doctor with a smile of reassurance, 
&quot;There&#39;s nothing to forgive.  You love her very much; I think it&#39;s an 
admirable quality.  It&#39;s one of the reasons I love you.&quot;

	The small woman let out a small laugh of release and joy.  Without 
warning, she dropped the hand she&#39;d been holding and leaned forward 
quickly, wrapping her arms around the dark haired woman&#39;s body, pressing 
her face into the crook of Setsuna&#39;s neck.  Hitomi nuzzled the soft 
skin, grinning into it and muttering a thank you.  A moment later, she 
felt two long arms encircle her which only caused her to snuggle even 
more into the lithe body in front of her.

	&quot;Ah,&quot; Setsuna said wisely, &quot;I&#39;ll have to remember to compliment 
you more often.&quot;  Though her face was gentle, her voice had a tint of 
teasing and amusement laced through it.  Hitomi merely giggled in 
response, mumbling that it wasn&#39;t just the compliment.  &quot;Oh?  Not just 
the compliment... was it that I said you didn&#39;t have to forgive me 
then?&quot;  Setsuna&#39;s face now wore a smirk, her magenta eyes dancing 
merrily.

	Hitomi rolled her eyes and shook her head, burying her nose into 
the soft skin and inhaling the wonderful aroma that always accompanied 
the elegant woman.  She hadn&#39;t realized until two nights ago how much 
she reveled in that aroma and how it seemed her nose always seemed to 
detect Setsuna before her eyes did.  But looking back on it, she&#39;d 
always felt strongly towards the beautiful and mysterious woman, 
probably taking for granted the fact that she&#39;d always be around.

	&quot;Well, that only leaves one part left,&quot; the tall woman&#39;s voice had 
softened considerably, her breath slightly hitched as she spoke.  From 
the chest just below her chin, Hitomi could feel Setsuna&#39;s heart beat 
become stronger and faster, a fact which delighted the blue haired 
doctor immensely.  &quot;I do love you, Hitomi, so very much.&quot;

	In response, the smaller woman tightened her grip on Setsuna and 
pushed her back so that she was now laying half on top of the dark 
haired woman, who merely laughed at the action by the woman in her arms.  
&quot;I love you, too, Setsuna.&quot;  Hitomi&#39;s own heart was pounding just as 
heavily and she continued to nuzzle the dark skinned neck beneath her.

	They stayed that way for several minutes; no other sound could be 
heard except the soft, shallow breaths each woman was emitting and the 
occasional strong wind from outside.  On her way over to Setsuna&#39;s this 
morning, Hitomi had heard on the radio that a strong storm was brewing 
up just southwest of Tokyo and that it would hit in a few days.  From 
the rolling clouds and growing wind, the doctor assumed it might even be 
sooner.

	&quot;You know, I could never fully comprehend what Ami-chan is to you, 
but I think I&#39;m beginning to understand the feelings you have towards 
her.  Makoto often gives me a run for my money.&quot;

	As if reminded of where she was, Hitomi quickly began to pull away 
from the dark skinned woman below, &quot;Ah! Makoto-kun, she hasn&#39;t awakened 
yet?&quot;

	Setsuna laughed and pulled the blue haired woman back onto her, 
holding her tersely in place.  &quot;She&#39;s staying at a friend&#39;s house for 
the next few days.  They&#39;re working on a school project together and 
figured they would get it finished earlier and quicker this way.&quot;

	Hitomi breathed out a sigh of relief and rested her head on the 
tall woman&#39;s chest, snuggling into the soft, cuddly dark red robe which 
the woman was wearing.  &quot;Makoto-kun seems competent and quite sure of 
herself.  She doesn&#39;t appear at all to be that high maintenance; she 
reminds me of Ami-chan sometimes, always making decisions by herself.&quot;

	Unconsciously, Setsuna began to stroke the blue haired woman&#39;s 
back, memorizing which spots gave way to certain reactions from Hitomi.  
&quot;That&#39;s what worries me about her, though.  I think she feels she has to 
do everything on her own because no one can understand the pain hidden 
away.  She is different from Ami-chan in that regard, I believe.&quot;

	&quot;How did you come to know her... if you don&#39;t mind me asking?&quot;

	The dark haired woman sighed, &quot;I was very good friends with her 
mother when I was younger.  There was an estrangement between us; I 
didn&#39;t approve of the man she married and in turn, she refused to 
acknowledge our friendship anymore.  They moved away somewhere together 
and I never saw them again.  She was pregnant at the time, though I 
wasn&#39;t aware of it.  A few years after, I received some paperwork and a 
letter, an apology from her.  The papers she&#39;d sent me were documents 
that I&#39;d become Makoto&#39;s guardian should she and her husband ever pass 
away.  I didn&#39;t get a return address, only a lawyer I should give them 
to if I agreed and signed the documents.&quot;

	Setsuna closed her eyes and wrapped her arms around the small 
doctor, &quot;It took me many, many years to make that decision, which I only 
agreed to because I figured there was no chance of that happening; I was 
wrong.&quot;  A tear escaped out from under her eyelid as she explained, 
&quot;When I went to the office, the lawyer informed me that both Kino&#39;s were 
killed in a plane crash a few years before and that their surviving 
child, Makoto, was living with her aunt and uncle.  With the validity of 
these documents, I could take over guardianship of her.&quot;

	Hitomi had pulled back and was now watching the dark haired woman 
with concern.  She would reach up every so often and brush away a tear, 
receiving a smile and a hug in return.  No wonder Setsuna worries so 
much, with a past like this...  The small woman frowned and continued to 
listen faithfully to the story.

	&quot;I didn&#39;t want to break up blood family, though.  So I decided to 
visit the aunt and uncle, to inform them of the situation and that I 
would not be taking Makoto away from them.  I guess I was also curious 
to find out any information about Shizuka, Makoto&#39;s mother... my best 
friend.  What had happened and how she was until her death.  When I 
arrived at the house, though, it only took one glance to realize I 
needed to take Makoto away from it all.  Her uncle was a drunk, her aunt 
a prostitute; their house was a run-down trailer and it seemed that they 
didn&#39;t at all care where the young girl was or even what she was doing.  
Not getting any information about Makoto&#39;s whereabouts, I asked around 
the neighborhood.

	&quot;I found out that the uncle was often abusive towards Makoto, even 
out in public.  The police had been called many times, but no arrests 
were made.  It appeared that Makoto would lie to them.  After a few 
months, she stopped living there, but would come by from time to time.  
She was in the area, the residents would see her from time to time; but 
she was mostly spotted entering and leaving an empty warehouse on the 
outskirts of town.  I took up in a small hotel and agonized about how to 
address this girl; she probably didn&#39;t trust adults after living with 
those people and I might be viewed as a threat.

	&quot;But I had made the decision when I signed those papers.  I would 
look after Makoto, if only because of my fondness for Shizuka.  She 
didn&#39;t seem too surprised when I found her, though.  And oddly enough, 
she complied with little complaint or struggle when I asked her to come 
live with me.  Oh, Hitomi, she was so haggard, so starved, and so tired 
looking, no wonder she came with me; it wrenched my heart seeing her 
like that.&quot;  Setsuna bit her lip as more tears came out.

      Instinctively, the doctor leaned forward and pressed her lips 
against the tall woman&#39;s.  It wasn&#39;t exactly a kiss, as Hitomi was 
whispering soothing and gentle words while she pushed against the other 
woman&#39;s luscious lips, but it seemed to do it&#39;s trick as Setsuna began 
to calm down a bit.
      
      The dark haired woman took several small breaths and Hitomi pulled 
away, reaching her hand up to caress the side of the other woman&#39;s face.  
After a few moments, the blue haired woman decided to break the silence, 
her curiosity getting the better of her.
      
      &quot;Why didn&#39;t you approve of the man Shizuka married?&quot;  Even though 
she felt very bad about Makoto&#39;s situation, the doctor couldn&#39;t help but 
wonder what would drive such a good friend away.  She remembered Setsuna 
speaking of the woman every so often, her eyes would glaze over with a 
quiet happiness, but she&#39;d never told Hitomi about any of this, of the 
connection with Makoto, of why she never talked about anything past high 
school.  The small woman cursed herself for not taking more of an 
interest.
      
      Opening her eyes, Setsuna pulled the doctor back down to her, 
smiling when the woman rested her head on the pillow she was using, her 
nose and lips pressed into the dark haired woman&#39;s cheek.  &quot;He was 
involved in some shady projects.  My father&#39;s friend, who at the time 
was a prominent district attorney, had been looking into some actions of 
the Yakuza.  Several deaths linked back to Nori-the man who Shizuka was 
marrying.  I tried to discuss this with her, but she defended him 
vehemently, telling me I was wrong and that if I could not see him for 
the good man he was that we wouldn&#39;t be friends anymore.
      
      &quot;I was stubborn and young, so I merely let her run away with him, 
turning my back and focusing on my studies.  I regretted it for many 
years, even after I got the letter, but I had no way of getting in 
contact with her.  It was like they&#39;d both disappeared from the planet; 
after my father&#39;s friend was shot to death in his car, we assumed 
wherever they were, the Yakuza must either be after them or hiding them.  
It was a lost cause.&quot;
      
      &quot;Do you think the plane crash was an accident?&quot;  Hitomi asked.
      
      Setsuna frowned deeply, &quot;Nothing was officially linked... But I 
wonder...&quot;
      
      Hitomi frowned as well; there was so much she didn&#39;t know and so 
much she wanted to learn about this woman.  She snuggled deeper against 
the slender body, bringing her hand up and touching her fingers lightly 
across Setsuna&#39;s neck and up to her lips.  Receiving a happy sigh and 
smile for her efforts, the blue haired doctor grinned, kissing the soft 
skin on her cheek.
      
      &quot;I think Makoto is lucky to have you as a guardian, Setsuna,&quot; 
Hitomi murmured lazily.  Being here on top of the other woman, her 
strong arms wrapped around her, her body so warm and her heartbeat so 
strong, it all seemed so perfect, so satisfying.
      
      The dark haired woman turned her head, capturing Hitomi&#39;s lips in 
a tender kiss, a silent thank you with so much meaning packed behind it.  
She pulled away, only a few inches, speaking softly, &quot;Would you like to 
spend the day here, or do you have to work?&quot;
      
      The doctor groaned, pressing her face against Setsuna&#39;s black 
strands, and grumbled angrily.
      
      &quot;What was that?&quot; The tall woman asked with an amused smile.
      
      Pulling back, Hitomi began to speak with more clarity this time, 
&quot;I have to be in at 10.&quot;  She pulled her arm back and looked at the 
watch on her wrist, &quot;It&#39;s nearly 8 right now and I suppose I should get 
home and get ready...&quot;
      
      &quot;Oh, okay.&quot;
      
      The small woman frowned.  In hers and Setsuna&#39;s long chats last 
night and the previous night, it had become abundantly clear to her that 
her work, while not the whole reason, was a big part of why she hadn&#39;t 
gotten with this beautiful creature much earlier.  &quot;But, you know... I 
have three weeks worth of sick days and I am feeling a bit feverish at 
the moment...&quot;
      
      Setsuna laughed, &quot;As much as I would love spending three weeks 
with you, I think the hospital would break down and explode without you 
there.&quot;
      
      Hitomi rolled her eyes, jabbing the tall woman playfully in the 
side, &quot;No, I meant just for today, but if you don&#39;t want me...&quot;  She 
proceeded to sit up, disengaging her arms and body from the woman below.
      
      Quickly, the dark haired woman pulled the doctor back down, still 
laughing softly, her face aglow, &quot;No, silly, I would love to spend the 
day with you, if that&#39;s your decision.&quot;
      
      Night blue eyes glazed over with such desire and happiness that 
all that waiting Setsuna had done seemed so worth it if only for just 
this moment.  The two women leaned in for a long, languid kiss, Hitomi&#39;s 
arms sliding lazily over the tall woman&#39;s shoulders, her body molding 
almost perfectly to the one below.
      
      For all those years, for all that time, it seemed things were 
coming together, and even with Makoto&#39;s past, Setsuna was sure that 
things were going to get better from now on.  She loved all the women in 
her life dearly: Hitomi, Makoto, Ami... and she would do anything to 
protect and keep that happiness, if only to be able to see their smiles.  
Her heart began to beat rapidly and the dark haired woman could only 
think about one thing-she was going to have a family, a family with the 
woman she loved for so long.

-------------------------------------

	Rei felt as though she hadn&#39;t slept a wink all night long.  She 
woke up at four, like she always did for morning meditation, but she 
stayed in the room and watched the small blue haired girl who had been 
sleeping so peacefully and beautifully for the past several hours.  The 
raven haired girl lost all track of everything as she watched the 
precious genius with such adoration.  Her own heart felt like it was 
dying only to be reborn every time she traced her eyes over the girl&#39;s 
soft lips or her long, graceful eyelashes that caressed the snow-white 
cheek below.

	After Haruka and Michiru finally let her go back to the party, 
she&#39;d been surprised to find that Makoto had already left.  Ami was 
sitting on the couch quietly, not meeting Rei&#39;s lavender eyes at all; 
the raven haired teen thought that the small girl probably felt guilty 
about her outburst, even if it wasn&#39;t her fault, she&#39;d feel guilty.  
After they finished opening the rest of the presents and eating cake and 
ice cream, it was pretty late, so the Miko ushered everyone out of the 
shrine, wanting her time alone with the blue haired teen.

	First, she apologized to Ami, asking for forgiveness at her 
manners.  Ami, being the girl she was, said it was unnecessary and that 
she knew Rei didn&#39;t really like Makoto.  And despite the heavy weight on 
each girl&#39;s mind about the incident, neither talked about the genius&#39; 
feelings towards the rogue.  They stayed up a little longer, chatting 
about how the blue haired teen felt about being 16 finally and about how 
Yuuichiro had yet to give up on trying getting a date with Rei.

	But it wasn&#39;t like their normal talks; their answers were short 
and their questions didn&#39;t probe further than necessary.  The raven 
haired girl knew it was because of that damned Kino and she cursed the 
girl&#39;s name every time Ami looked the least bit uncomfortable in Rei&#39;s 
presence.

	Tearing her eyes away from her sleeping beauty, the Miko looked 
over to her dresser where she had stuffed the envelope.  A sigh escaped 
her lips; she still hadn&#39;t examined the contents of it and it was 
plaguing her to near death to know what was inside.  She glanced back at 
the sleeping form on the floor and proceeded to climb off the bed as 
quietly as possible.  Once on the floor, Rei tiptoed to the dresser and 
slid the drawer open, slowly and softly so as to not wake the other 
girl.

	Moving some of her under garments out of the way, her lavender 
eyes stared long and hard at the manila envelope; if she was going to 
have any chance of opening Ami&#39;s eyes in realization that Kino wasn&#39;t as 
great as she was thinking, it would be better done sooner than later.  
If what was in there confirmed what she&#39;d been seeing in front of the 
fire, it made sense to reveal it before anyone else got hurt.

	She reached out and took hold of the corner of &#39;Pandora&#39;s Box&#39;, 
sliding it out from under the clothing gently, as though afraid it would 
shatter at any moment.

	&quot;Mmm... Rei... what time is it?&quot;

	The Miko jumped back, hastily shoving the envelope back in the 
drawer and pushing it shut.  She quickly composed herself and looked 
down to find a sleepy Ami rubbing at her eyes and reaching for her 
glasses on the night table above her.

	Ah, she didn&#39;t see anything!  Rei let out a sigh of relief, 
&quot;Mornin&#39; Ami-chan!  It&#39;s umm...&quot;  What time was it?  Scanning the room, 
the sexy teen found the clock, reading the numbers out loud, &quot;Its half 
past 8.&quot;

	The blue haired girl nodded as she placed the rimless glasses on 
her face.  She stretched several moments before standing up and walking 
towards the door.  Rei could only watch, feeling her eyes glaze over, 
only thinking how cute the girl looked when she first woke up.  It took 
all her strength not to jump the girl right then and there.  At the 
door, Ami stopped suddenly and turned around to face her raven haired 
friend.

	&quot;Rei?&quot;

      The Miko blinked several times, realizing the genius was now 
addressing her, &quot;Y-yes Ami-chan?&quot;
      
      Ami smiled, &quot;Did you want to use the bathroom first?&quot;
      
      Rei shook her head, &quot;Nah, go ahead, I&#39;ll wash up in Grandpa&#39;s 
bathroom since he&#39;s not here.&quot;
      
      Nodding, Ami went back into the room and gathered up her bag, 
giving the lavender eyed girl a brief nod before exiting out and going 
down the hall towards the bathroom.  Rei let out another sigh of relief.  
She stood a few moments, staring long and hard at the drawer, a war 
began to rage itself from within.

---------------------------

	Both girls showered, had breakfast, and were now standing out at 
the top of the shrine steps, stalling a bit before Ami had to go home.

	&quot;It really wasn&#39;t a bad party at all, Rei-chan.&quot;  The blue haired 
girl smiled sweetly at her friend.

	The Miko rolled her eyes, her arms crossed over her chest, &quot;Yeah, 
but it wasn&#39;t great... tch... honestly...&quot;  Her agitation showed, but 
she refrained from saying the rogue&#39;s name.  Rei didn&#39;t know why, but 
for some reason she didn&#39;t want to bring up that girl with Ami; maybe it 
was the fear that the girl would actually show some true affection for 
her if she said anything.

	The genius stepped forward, enveloping the raven haired girl in a 
hug.  &quot;It was so wonderful of you and Haruka to chase them all off; that 
in and of itself seemed like the best present ever.&quot;  She laughed and 
stepped back, &quot;I feel very blessed to have a friend like you, Rei-chan.&quot;

	The sexy girl couldn&#39;t breathe and frowned deeply when Ami pulled 
away completely.  It wasn&#39;t the first hug the two shared, but Rei still 
couldn&#39;t help but reveling in the feeling every time it occurred.  The 
blue haired girl was always so soft and so vulnerable; the Miko couldn&#39;t 
help but grow to love her even more.

	&quot;You know I&#39;d do anything for you, Ami-chan.&quot;  Rei grinned lazily, 
reaching out and brushing the girl&#39;s cheek for a brief moment before 
pulling her arm back.

	Baby blue eyes washed over with silent worry, something the raven 
haired girl couldn&#39;t let go unnoticed.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

	Ami smiled, &quot;Ah, well... I mean,&quot; the girl took a deep breath and 
then waved her hand, &quot;It&#39;s nothing.&quot;

	Lavender eyes narrowed with skepticism; Rei tapped her foot 
several times and then turned and began to walk back to the building.

	&quot;R-rei-chan?&quot;

	Without looking back, the Miko responded, &quot;Stay right there, I 
have yet to give you my real present.&quot;

	&quot;But you gave me the book...&quot;

	Rei pretended she didn&#39;t hear her and went inside the building.  
Ami sighed and toed the ground in front of her; she felt like she had 
been walking on broken glass with the raven haired girl after the 
incident with Makoto last night.  And she desperately wanted to talk 
with the girl about what was bothering her; for some reason, the genius 
doubted her foul mood was entirely Makoto&#39;s fault-there was something 
else wrong.  A strong gust of wind blew against the small girl causing 
her to shiver slightly; she looked up to see rolling clouds, several of 
them dark.

	&quot;A storm...&quot; She murmured to herself.

	After several moments, the lavender eye girl reemerged from the 
building, her hands behind her back.  Her face was washed over with 
nervousness and worry.  Instantly, the blue haired girl became very 
concerned and took a step towards the Miko.

	&quot;Are you okay?&quot;

	Rei shook her head dismissively and stopped a few feet in front of 
the genius, her gaze on the ground at her feet.  She took a deep breath 
and brought her eyes up to meet baby blues.  The raven haired girl 
fought away the blush that threatened to cross her cheeks; the sight of 
Ami always seemed to take her breath away most recently.

	&quot;Ami-chan... we&#39;ve been friends for a long time.  You trust me, 
don&#39;t you?&quot;  Rei paused a moment, watching as the blue haired girl 
nodded vehemently, her face taut with worry and anxiety. &quot;We&#39;re always 
there for one another and it&#39;s always been so much fun being with you.  
I can&#39;t imagine my life without you, but lately, it just feels like 
you&#39;ve been pulling away and going in a different direction.  At first I 
just didn&#39;t know what to do... should I let you go that way... should I 
pull you back?  It scared me.&quot;

	The raven haired girl shifted, glancing back and forth before 
resuming eye contact, &quot;But I&#39;ve decided, I&#39;m not going to let you go, I 
won&#39;t give up without a fight.  Ami, I&#39;m sorry, I know this isn&#39;t going 
to be fair to you, but it&#39;s not fair for me either to deny my own 
feelings.&quot;  Pulling her arms out from behind her back, she showed the 
blue haired girl what she&#39;d been hiding.

	Ami gasped, her confusion washed away with slight shock and her 
chest tightening painfully.  Rei was holding a dozen blue roses and 
pushed them forward gently, encouraging the shorter girl to take them.  
Slowly, with much hesitation, the blue haired girl took the roses, 
unconsciously bringing them to her nose and inhaling the sweet scent.  
Realizing quickly what she was doing, Ami dropped her arms to her sides, 
still holding onto the roses.

	&quot;Rei... I...&quot; She didn&#39;t get to finish as without warning, the 
Miko engulfed her in a tight hug.

	&quot;I&#39;m in love with you Ami-chan!  I&#39;ve been in love with you for 
quite some time... I was waiting for you to realize your love for me; 
you must have it, right?!  It&#39;s okay, though... Like I said, I&#39;m not 
going out without a fight.&quot;  She pulled part back from the hug, finding 
a teary, wide-eyed girl staring back at her.  Without a second thought, 
Rei leaned in and kissed the corner of the girl&#39;s mouth, partly on the 
cheek and partly on her lips.  She kept her lips hovering near Ami&#39;s 
mouth as she continued.

	&quot;I&#39;ll do anything to win you over.  I want you to see me in a 
different light, with different feelings other than friendship... please 
Ami-chan... give me a chance.  We&#39;ve known each other for so long; you 
owe me at least one date...&quot;

	Her breath was hot and fierce on the blue haired girl&#39;s lips.  Ami 
couldn&#39;t figure out why she hadn&#39;t pushed the girl away, her mind was 
running a mile a minute and yet it was coming up with nothing.  Rei... 
has... feelings... for ...me  She also had to admit that she didn&#39;t 
exactly hate the kiss, nor the current embrace.  If her hands were free, 
the genius thought she&#39;d be tearing her hair out piece by piece at the 
moment for how confused and torn she felt at the moment.

	But Rei-chan... my best friend.

	Rei felt tears stinging the corners of her eyes when she realized 
Ami still had yet to answer.  She had bared her soul to the girl and was 
feeling particularly vulnerable at the moment.  Not wanting to be 
rejected, the fiery tempered girl tightened her arms around the small 
teen and kissed her with as much passion as she could muster.  The blue 
haired girl didn&#39;t seem to respond, only became even stiffer in her arms 
and so Rei pushed her tongue at the girl&#39;s lips and teeth, beckoning for 
entrance.

	She didn&#39;t want to enjoy the kiss, she wanted to get as far away 
as possible, she needed to sort this out logically; but her body decided 
not to listen and her brain fogged over with haze.  Ami opened her 
mouth, allowing the other girl&#39;s tongue to enter and wrestle her own.  
Without any thought, the small girl began to move her lips, moaning into 
the kiss, reveling in the taste, the heat, the feeling of her tongue 
against the other girls.

	The Miko grinned inwardly when she felt the genius not only 
return, but moan into the kiss.  They continued on, Rei assaulting Ami&#39;s 
tongue and mouth and the blue haired girl dropping the flowers so she 
could wrap her own arms around the raven haired girl, rubbing her body 
against her.  It seemed like hours before Rei finally had to pull away, 
gasping for breath.  She grinned over at the genius, who was also 
gasping for breath, her eyes hazy and her lips turned upwards slightly.

	&quot;That... was... Oh Ami-chan.&quot;

	Hearing Rei&#39;s voice, Ami seemed to remember where she was; her 
eyes became sharper and she shook her head.  Oh god... what have I... 
She didn&#39;t finish the thought as she let go of the raven haired girl and 
then shoved out of her grasp; she turned and began to run down the 
steps, tears flying out of the corners of her eyes.

	&quot;AMI!&quot;  Immediately, the Miko took off after her friend, but 
stumbled only five steps down and twisted her ankle.  Rei hissed at the 
pain and tried to stand up to chase after the fleeing blue haired teen.  
The moment she put weight on the ankle though, she immediately fell back 
down again.  Tears flooded her own eyes and she knew that they weren&#39;t 
from the ankle as she watched Ami&#39;s blurry form disappear down the steps 
and out the gate.

	&quot;Ami-chan...&quot;
