<h1>Slayer and Shadow (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>        It all began with just a simple wish....

        Cordelia Chase, unreasoningly angry over the turn her life had 
taken , blurted out, &quot;I wish that Buffy had never come to Sunnydale!&quot; 
Sadly, she did so with a vengeance demon called Anyanka nearby, who 
granted that wish, and remade their world.

        Sunnydale was transformed into a vampire ruled city, lead by 
the Master. Willow and Xander, once heroic champions, were vampire 
servants of the Master, torturing Angel for their amusement. A rag-tag 
band of vampire slayers lead by Rupert Giles tried to oppose him, but 
their efforts were mostly futile.

        Calling upon a scarred, bitter Vampire Slayer named Buffy they 
prepared for a final battle even as Giles worked to undo the wish that 
had created that world. The Master slew Buffy with his bare hands, 
even as the vampire slayers fell all around them, Willow being slain 
by Oz, even as Giles shattered the crystal of power belonging to 
Anyanka.

        Sunnydale was restored to normal, and that should have been 
the end.

        Anyanka, now simply calling herself Anya, desperately wanted 
to regain her power. Calling upon Willow wiccan assistance she tried 
to reach into that &#39;wish-verse&#39; to retrieve her powers. They failed, 
but unknowingly they had brought something back with them.

        The vampire version of Willow had come to Sunnydale. Gathering 
hench- vamps, she sought to make this world like the one she had come 
from, but Buffy and her friends managed to round her up fairly 
quickly. But the vamp Willow was a disturbing revelation to the merry 
band, with her clear interest in the female of the species and kinky 
sexual nature.

        With Giles&#39; assistance Willow reversed the enchantment, and 
after getting in a bit of a grope of her counterpart, vamp Willow went 
on home. Willow&#39;s boyfriend Oz left, and after a period of grieving 
Willow fell in love again, this time with a woman named Tara. Their 
lives went on, their love was challenged, broken, and ultimately 
restored before Tara was tragically slain.

        In the fanfic Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Itsumo means Forever, 
Willow has returned to Sunnydale to guard over the First, who was 
sealed away behind the Hellmouth by Buffy, Spike and Anya&#39;s heroic 
sacrifice. Still in shock over the return of Tara, the servants of the 
First conjured up the vampire Willow, hoping she could slay her twin.

        While Willow discovered her combat magic&#39;s couldn&#39;t directly 
effect her vampire twin, she could quite effectively contain her. At 
Faith&#39;s suggestion they were able to restore the soul of the 
vampiress, and then returned her home, unknowingly setting a new chain 
of events in motion...
