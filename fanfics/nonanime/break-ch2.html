<h1>Break Shadow (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/break-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Raven stared out at the bay of Black City.  Her eyes were glazed as the 
rain decided to fall on the world.  Footsteps fell softly behind her 
and she sighed.  Starfire was, as always, quite curious about why Raven 
was so deep in thought about the most recent battle.  The alien had 
held off on questions for the remainder of the previous day, but she 
wasn&#39;t going to take silence for an answer.

&quot;Raven?&quot; Starfire asked anxiously.  &quot;I hate to have a sticky nose, but 
may I ask you about what happened yesterday?&quot;  Raven allowed herself a 
swift smirk at Starfire&#39;s mismatched terms and let out a small sigh.  
She turned about to face the girl, Starfire standing still with her 
hands closed over her chest.

&quot;When I told you about myself, I left quite a bit out,&quot; Raven admitted.  
&quot;I simplified a lot of things, and I didn&#39;t really want to talk about 
her.&quot;  Starfire recalled the conversation that they had shared in the 
dark alleyway.  Raven had mentioned briefly that her life had been 
chaos until she was eight, but left it at that.  The taller of the 
girls cocked her head in the silly manner she had.

&quot;You did not mean that your life was random and hard to understand,&quot; 
Starfire murmured.  &quot;You meant that she was your life?&quot;  Raven shook 
her head with a hard exhale.  It was a difficult thing to even try to 
explain, and Starfire was making it harder.

&quot;Yes and no,&quot; the sorceress replied.  &quot;Chaos was always around when I 
was younger.  She was around so much that I couldn&#39;t think of life 
without her.  When I was eight, she just vanished one day.  There was 
no goodbye or explanation of why, she just disappeared.  She taught me 
a lot about my powers and how to restrain my emotions.  I owe her, I 
suppose.  But I don&#39;t understand why she&#39;s shown up now.&quot;

&quot;And you do not understand why she performed an act of love to you?&quot;  
Raven stiffened at the remark, her eyes a bit wider than normal.  She 
stared at Starfire, who only smiled back at her.  Raven wondered why 
Starfire was so blunt, but reminded herself that the planet the other 
girl came from served something called &quot;pudding of sadness.&quot;  They were 
blunt, but rather creative with their emotions.

&quot;Love isn&#39;t a word, much less an emotion I&#39;d associate with Chaos,&quot; 
Raven muttered.  &quot;When I last saw her eight years ago, she was like I 
am.  We weren&#39;t the cheeriest of people because we couldn&#39;t be.  I 
don&#39;t see why Chaos was acting like she was yesterday.&quot;  Starfire 
tilted her head in bemusement, and Raven sighed.  There really was no 
way of getting around giving Starfire an explanation, so she began to 
tell her tale.

----------

A heavy rain doused the area.  It was a rare thing for rain to fall so 
much on Azarath.  Azarath, home of demons and angels, and all those 
mixed between.  A woman led by a massive dog stepped lightly through 
the puddles of rain.  She held a one-sided blade in her right hand, red 
eyes uncovered.  She, Chaos, strode towards a certain house that was 
apart from all others.

&quot;What do you smell, Flame?&quot; Chaos asked the dog.  The dog turned its 
head slightly, casting red eyes about and taking in deep breaths.  As 
raindrops fell to its black fur, steam rose up and was whisked away in 
the breeze and gently waving fur.  The beast, not an animal at all, was 
her familiar.  Chaos was a pureblood demon, born through the blood of 
black elemental magic and dark flames.  She understood what the 
creature, made from black fire itself, said silently.

&quot;Hatred?&quot; Chaos murmured.  &quot;She&#39;s going to kill herself.  Get in the 
house and stop her.&quot;  The dog growled softly and leapt away.  Chaos 
sighed and continued to walk towards the house, almost smirking when a 
crunch signaled the door&#39;s destruction.  She strode through the broken 
doorway, stepping easily over the fallen door.  In a room dark from the 
night and the rain, a woman sat curled on the floor.  A few feet away, 
a sharp kitchen knife lay on the floor under the black dog&#39;s paw.  She 
sobbed, her long black hair falling around her face.

&quot;Please, no more demons!&quot; she sobbed, her hands shaking madly over her 
temples.  &quot;I don&#39;t even want to live anymore!  Please, for the love of 
god, let me die!&quot;  Chaos gazed at the woman, eyes usually filled with 
the lust for battle soft.  After a moment, she laid down her sword and 
knelt down next to the woman.

&quot;Your name is Alena, isn&#39;t it?&quot; the demon woman asked.  She reached out 
to touch the woman&#39;s shoulder, pausing when the sobbing woman jerked 
away.  Carefully, slowly, she tried again and let her fingers trail on 
the woman&#39;s cheek.  She gently wiped the tears away and lifted Alena&#39;s 
chin so she would look up.

&quot;I&#39;m not here to hurt you,&quot; Chaos explained, her crimson eyes creating 
a calming hypnotic effect.  &quot;I know what you are.  You are a half-breed 
between a human woman and an angel.  I know what happened to you just a 
few nights ago.  You were raped by a demon named Trigon.  Do you know 
why I know all of this?&quot;  Alena shook her head, tears still slowly 
falling from her eyes.

&quot;Something happened to me about a week ago,&quot; Chaos continued to 
explain.  &quot;Something that rarely happens to pureblood demons.  I was 
visited in my dreams by the archangel Gabriel.  He showed me a prophecy 
that involved you, Trigon, and the child developing in your body.  
Gabriel said that there was something important about your 
child-something I cannot remember.  Demons can rarely remembers dreams, 
much less prophecies.

&quot;I can only remember that he said your child is important to the world.  
He warned me to not let you die and to make sure that your child stays 
alive.  There will be others after you.  They will try to kill Trigon&#39;s 
child.  He is second only to Lucifer himself, and this child-mixed with 
demon, angel, and human blood-may even surpass him.  You must stay 
alive.&quot;

&quot;But this is...terrible,&quot; Alena whispered in despair.  &quot;That terrible 
thing did this to me!  He took everything from me!  He took my body and 
raped it!&quot;  Chaos sighed and pulled the woman close.

&quot;I know that I&#39;m not one to say that you should try to live,&quot; the demon 
said.  &quot;Up until this point, I have traveled through the human realm 
and Azarath killing everything in my sight.  I&#39;ve been called the grim 
reaper at times.  The thing is, demons and angels do not associate well 
with each other and will often engage in death battles when they 
encounter each other.  For an angel, not to mention the archangel 
Gabriel, to visit a pureblood demon for a prophecy is something that&#39;s 
never happened.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s your point?&quot; Alena asked bitterly.  &quot;Why should I believe you?&quot;  
Chaos frowned and stood up, taking her sword in hand.  She stood with 
the razor-sharp tip of the blade against Alena&#39;s throat.  The sword was 
forged by Chaos herself in her own black flames, and there was no blade 
in any realm that was sharper.  The lightest touch caused a line of 
blood to run down Alena&#39;s neck.

&quot;Look as deep inside yourself as you can,&quot; Chaos ordered.  &quot;Any person 
with angelic blood should be able to sense anything within themselves.  
Find that tiny new life in your body, if you can.  I will slice your 
throat in thirty seconds unless you tell me not to.&quot;  Alena looked into 
Chaos&#39; bloodthirsty eyes and saw the death that Chaos was nicknamed 
for.  She closed her own blue eyes and delved deep into her own spirit.

Chaos kept her eyes on Alena, her mind easily keeping track of the 
time.  After thirty seconds, she pulled her sword back and thrust at 
top speed.  Alena&#39;s eyes snapped open, consumed by brilliant white 
light.  Chaos&#39; entire body was covered with wicked shadows and thrown 
backwards into a wall.  Not a second later, the shadows vanished and 
Chaos fell onto her feet.

&quot;By Lucifer,&quot; the demon coughed.  &quot;Even this early, that child has its 
father&#39;s strength.  Only Trigon or my father can throw me so hard.&quot;  
Alena gasped, placing her hands over her lower abdomen.  The power had 
surged through her, and none of it had been hers.  It was undeniably 
strong.

&quot;So the prophecy was true,&quot; Chaos murmured.  &quot;Damn that angel.  I 
suppose I&#39;ll have to keep you alive until that child is born or I&#39;ll 
have all of Heaven after my blood.&quot;  She turned towards the door, 
beckoning the dog Flame to her side.  &quot;Teach the child as you like.  My 
business is only to make sure it stays safe.&quot;  She strode towards the 
door, sliding the sword into a sheath on her back.

&quot;Wait!&quot; Alena cried.  Chaos paused, turning to glance back at the 
woman.  &quot;Please, I&#39;m begging you...teach her.&quot;

&quot;Her?&quot; Chaos sneered, flashing the fangs all demons bore.  &quot;So you&#39;re 
going to bare a girl.  What difference does that make to me?  Why 
should I teach her?&quot;

&quot;My skills only go as far as healing,&quot; Alena murmured desperately.  
&quot;You felt that dark magic yourself!  She&#39;s more demon than anything 
else, and she&#39;d learn from you!  Please, for her own sake, teach her.&quot;  
Chaos sighed, casting her eyes towards the outside.  Alena let her eyes 
fall, realizing that pleading with a demon was a rather futile effort.

&quot;Very well,&quot; Chaos said grudgingly.  &quot;I will teach the girl, but I will 
not suffer through preaching about the value of life.  I&#39;m a demon, and 
I live to kill.&quot;  Alena nodded, glad that the demon so feared for death 
would help her and her future child.

----------

&quot;That is how you met Chaos?&quot; Starfire asked innocently.  Raven sighed a 
bit, surprisingly not irritated.

&quot;No, Starfire,&quot; she replied.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t born yet.  That was how my 
mother met Chaos, and how Chaos became my teacher.  She taught me 
everything about controlling my emotions so my powers wouldn&#39;t destroy 
everything.&quot;  Starfire nodded as she began to understand what exactly 
made Raven what she was.

&quot;But you said Chaos could see,&quot; the alien said bemusedly.  &quot;When we met 
her today, she said she was blind.&quot;  Raven sighed once more, looking 
out over the bay.

&quot;When I was eight, I was attacked by pureblood demons while Chaos was 
teaching me,&quot; she began to explain.  &quot;What happened is how Chaos became 
blind.&quot;

----------

&quot;So the merchant of death has lowered herself to playing teacher to a 
little half-breed freak?&quot; the dog-faced demon barked laughingly.  
&quot;Well, we&#39;ll just have to kill you along with the kid.&quot;  Chaos stood 
from her meditative position, Flame standing at her side.  Raven, 
merely a child of eight, stood close to her master in subconscious 
fear.  While she learned not to show the emotion, she was still a 
frightened child.

&quot;I&#39;ve not lowered myself,&quot; Chaos growled, drawing her sword.  &quot;I&#39;d just 
rather not have every angel in Heaven hunting me for letting their 
prophetic child get killed by the likes of you.  Raven, focus.  Do not 
let them touch you.  Remember that your power is stronger than theirs.&quot;  
Raven nodded, pulling her hood up over her head.

&quot;Kill them both!&quot; the dog-faced demon shouted.  The five demons rushed 
at Raven and Chaos.  Chaos held her sword in one hand before her, 
facing two angry demons.

&quot;Return to my blade, Flame!&quot; she commanded.  The dog howled and 
vanished into shapeless black fire.  It rushed to Chaos&#39; sword and 
surrounded the blade.  With unparalleled speed, Chaos ran at the two 
demons and cut them down in one fell swoop.  They fell to the ground 
with death cries as Chaos swung the blade to cast the blood away.

&quot;Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos!&quot; Raven cried, focusing her energy on a 
large tree.  Her signature black shadows captured the foliage and 
uprooted the massive pine.  Barely strained, she cast her hands at the 
two demons running at her with axes.  The tree followed her dark magic 
and slammed into the demons, thoroughly crushing them unto death.  
Raven, charged with her first success, whirled to face the final demon.  
Enraged, the demon hurled flaming shuriken at the young sorceress.  
Raven held her hands up, the black shadows creating a shield.

The shuriken bounced off the black magic and struck the demon-one in 
the forehead and two in the heart.  Two other shuriken, however, flew 
by the demon.  When the demon fell to the ground, dead, Raven allowed 
herself a small smirk.  However, the shout that echoed through the 
forest shattered her newfound glory.  She looked away from the demon to 
find her master fallen to the ground, hands over her face.

&quot;Master?&quot; she asked nervously.  &quot;Are you injured?&quot;  She walked 
cautiously towards the elder demon and froze when Chaos sat up and 
threw the two errant shuriken to the ground.  They were covered in 
black blood-blood trademark only to demons.  Chaos covered her eyes 
with a shaking hand, blood streaming down her face.

&quot;Master?&quot; Raven asked once more.  Chaos stood up, sword in her free 
hand.  After a moment of listening, she turned sightlessly to the young 
girl.  With a shout filled with rage, she lifted her sword and swung 
down at Raven.  Raven lifted her hands automatically and created her 
dark shield.  The sword clashed against magic.  Raven strained against 
Chaos&#39; strength and anger and eventually managed to deflect the blow.  
The sword slammed into the ground.  Dust flew into the air, and a 
massive gouge was created from the sheer force of the strike.

&quot;I can teach you nothing more,&quot; Chaos snarled, a hand still over her 
eyes.  &quot;My debt is done to those damned angels.&quot;  She turned from 
Raven, the black fire falling from her sword into its familiar form of 
the hound.  Chaos walked away without another word, and Raven was left 
alone.

----------

Starfire and Raven stood in silence for a time.  Raven kept her eyes to 
the water of the bay, whilst Starfire looked to the stars.  A moment 
passed, and Starfire let out a confused groan.

&quot;If she attacked you for taking her sight, why did she help us in 
battle today?&quot; the alien asked, rubbing her head to try and stimulate 
extra thought.  &quot;Would she not have tried to attack you again?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Raven admitted.  &quot;I couldn&#39;t heal her 
then, but I probably could now.  I don&#39;t know why she&#39;s here now.&quot;  
Before either girl could think of something to say, their emergency 
warning items began to blink.  There was simply no time to waste now.
