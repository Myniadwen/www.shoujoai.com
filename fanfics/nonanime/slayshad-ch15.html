<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Tara looked into the mirror with a frown, reaching up
to run a hand through her brown hair. &quot;Wish I looked
better,&quot; she sighed, adjusting the clothes she had
picked out. Going with an older look she had chosen a
simple dress and top, both in a mildly folksy pattern.

It had been, frankly, a long time since Tara had
considered going on a date, and most of those had been
when she was trying to follow her parent&#39;s wishes and
date guys. Her experience dating girls was pretty much
limited to her short time in college, right before the
Master&#39;s rise to power. She had discovered the gay
society and wiccan clubs, and in the process came to
learn more about herself.

&quot;I&#39;m going to be late,&quot; Tara frowned as she headed to
the apartment door, grabbing her coat and pulling it
on as she went out the door.

The streets of Sunnydale were quiet as Tara strode
towards the Bronze, glad that she had chosen to live
so close to her work. She was in so much of a hurry
that she wasn&#39;t paying quite as much attention as she
might have, and so was taken by surprise.

The vampire lunged from the shadows, eyes blazing as
it knocked her down and went for her throat. Tara
managed to hold it off, struggling, but she knew it
was going to get her. It&#39;s breath washed across her
face as the fangs drew closer, mouth stretched wide...
when it suddenly stiffened. A sharp end of wood stuck
from it&#39;s chest then it simply turned to dust,
revealing a woman standing confidently in the
moonlight.

Faith offered her hand, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;Nothing hurt but my pride,&quot; Tara sighed, taking her
hand so that Faith could firmly pull her back to her
feet.

Faith stood there dressed in black, a leather jacket,
pants and a pale colored T-shirt. Only a touch of
make-up marked her face, highlighting those eyes and
full, red lips. Lips that were quirked in a gentle
smile as she asked, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You look good,&quot; she answered her softly, Tara
returning that smile with one of her own.

&quot;So do you,&quot; Faith answered softly. She kept that hand
in her own as she said with a little smile, &quot;So, what
do you want to do tonight?&quot;

They walked together towards the Bronze, a gentle
breeze stirring their hair. The fall weather was
surprisingly comfortable, a gentle warmth carried in
the air. &quot;To be honest I hadn&#39;t really thought that
far ahead,&quot; she admitted.

&quot;I have some suggestions,&quot; Faith smiled wickedly, &quot;but
most of them are immoral.&quot;

&quot;Faith!&quot; Tara scolded, but she was still smiling.

Faith shrugged with a smile, &quot;Hey, at least I&#39;m
honest.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Tara smiled. The Bronze was busy, of course,
like most weekday nights, but the lines swiftly gave
way as the two women went inside.

&quot;So who&#39;s watching the place for you tonight?&quot; Faith
asked curiously.

&quot;I was a bit surprised who volunteered,&quot; Tara nodded
towards the bar.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Faith&#39;s eyes went wide in surprise.

Jenny Calendar smoothly drew some beer, her short
brown hair framing her face. The bold scar at her neck
went oddly well with the goth looking clothes she had
chosen. Beside her dressed in much more casual clothes
than was his normal style was Rupert Giles, slinging
drinks almost as well as his female companion.

Tara shrugged with a little smile, &quot;Jenny said she
wanted to, then Giles surprised me by agreeing to help
out.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know the G-man had it in him,&quot; Faith said
with a laugh.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; Giles looked up with a smile as he saw
them. He smiled as he quietly confessed, &quot;You know, I
haven&#39;t had this much fun since I was involved in the
London club scene.&quot;

&quot;Everything is going fine,&quot; Jenny swiftly anticipated
her student&#39;s question, &quot;now go find yourselves a
seat, I&#39;ll send Buffy over with something for you.&quot;

&quot;Buffy?&quot; Tara blinked.

&quot;Well, I couldn&#39;t leave her unsupervised,&quot; Giles
shrugged, &quot;and she, Willow and Dawn were all quite
eager to help out.&quot;

&quot;Though I think that Dawn just wanted to try and sneak
in some underaged drinking,&quot; Jenny confided to them
impishly.

&quot;No way,&quot; Giles said firmly.

Jenny chuckled as she turned to handle a customer,
&quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;

Faith had to laugh softly. &quot;We&#39;ll catch up with you
latter,&quot; she waved to them as she and Tara headed for
a corner table.

&quot;What a night,&quot; Tara murmured with a smile.

Faith casually pulled out a chair for Tara then sat
down in her own, studying the other woman
thoughtfully. &quot;Did I really surprise you,&quot; she asked,
&quot;when I asked you out a few nights ago?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Tara quietly admitted, &quot;I haven&#39;t been asked
out very often. I&#39;ve only really had one girlfriend,
before now.&quot;

&quot;I find that pretty hard to believe,&quot; Faith met her
eyes as she confessed, &quot;I wanted to ask you out the
day I met you.&quot;

&quot;What, when we were all fighting?&quot; Tara blinked.

&quot;You&#39;re beautiful when you&#39;re angry,&quot; Faith shrugged.

&quot;Here&#39;s your beers,&quot; Buffy set the two bottles down
with a soft clink, offering them both cheery smiles.
She looked good in the sleek dress she was wearing,
dirty blonde hair styled to highlight her expressive
eyes.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; a faintly blushing Tara said.

&quot;Good timing, B,&quot; Faith sighed.

With a smile that all but said she knew exactly what
she had interrupted Buffy added, &quot;If you need anything
else, just ask.&quot;

&quot;If I asked for what I wanted,&quot; Faith tossed an impish
look over at Tara as she growled out, &quot;Willow would
probably have a fit.&quot;

Buffy actually blushed, &quot;You are a bad girl, Faith.&quot;
With that she was off, heading back towards the bar
where Dawn was talking to some of the other patrons.

Tara chuckled softly, looking over at Faith with pure
amusement. &quot;You really like disconcerting her,&quot; she
said thoughtfully, taking a drink of her own beer.

Faith nodded as she picked up her beer, taking a long
pull before putting it down with a happy sigh, &quot;Oh
yeah.&quot; She looked over at Tara, &quot;Of course, what I&#39;d
like to be doing with you would get us thrown out of
here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m no model,&quot; Tara blushed faintly, &quot;why are you so
interested?&quot;

&quot;Models are overrated,&quot; Faith smiled at her as she
teasingly drawled, &quot;no endurance at all.&quot; More
seriously she added, &quot;And you are lovely.&quot;

Tara met her eyes, knowing that the young woman meant
every word. &quot;And you&#39;re beautiful,&quot; she murmured
softly.

Standing up by the bar Willow looked over at the
faintly blushing Buffy and asked her lover, &quot;What
happened?&quot;

Buffy chuckled, &quot;Faith decided to get me out of there
by teasing me.&quot;

Willow pushed her red tinted brown hair back,
&quot;Somehow, that doesn&#39;t really surprise me.&quot; She
studied the two women who were sitting so closely
together and smiled, &quot;At least things look like
they&#39;re going well.&quot;

They heard a laugh and watched as Dawn ran by,
carrying a load of empties to the bar. &quot;Someone
actually goosed me,&quot; she reported happily.

&quot;What are you so happy about?&quot; Buffy frowned.

&quot;It&#39;s the first time someone noticed me enough to do
that,&quot; Dawn grinned.</pre>
