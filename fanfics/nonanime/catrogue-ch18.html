<h1>The Adventures of Shadowcat and Rogue! (part 18 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>The ship rocked gently against the dock at Muir Isle, then a large, 
blue furred figure climbed out. He casually ambled along the wooden 
planks, until her reached a security camera nearby. Giving it a toothy 
smile, he said, &quot;It&#39;s just Hank McCoy, stopping by.&quot;

Then with surprising swiftness he crushed the camera!

Working quickly McCoy plugged a small laptop into the loose wiring, 
typing away rapidly. &quot;We&#39;re clear,&quot; he called back out to the boat.

Feral jumped out first, clearly happy to be back on dry land. &quot;I hate 
boats,&quot; she hissed, visibly shaking any moisture still on her right 
off.

Plasma climbed up on the dock, reaching back to help Polaris out.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Polaris smiled up at her gratefully. She looked over at 
Feral to say soothingly, &quot;We didn&#39;t have a lot of choice getting here. 
This monthly supply run to the Mutant Research Station was our best 
bet to get in unnoticed.&quot;

Sakura ignored Plasma&#39;s offered hand, smoothly vaulting up onto the 
deck and stalking over to McCoy&#39;s side. &quot;Can you successfully hack the 
security systems?&quot; she asked.

&quot;There&#39;s three lines of defense, each wired separately,&quot; McCoy still 
typed away, &quot;this outer line has been hacked, but there will still be 
defenses active nearer the buildings. Then the internal system will 
have to be dealt with.&quot;

Sakura just nodded, clearly not surprised.

&quot;I wonder why our big buddy Nemesis isn&#39;t along on this trip?&quot; Feral 
complained.

Polaris smiled grimly, &quot;I&#39;ve seen his file. If we wanted to nuke the 
island, bringing him along would be a good idea. Not a covert 
operation.&quot;

&quot;Not very subtle, I take it,&quot; Plasma smiled.

A short burst of laughter from Polaris, &quot;Not at all.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Sakura said simply.

They moved cautiously across the hills up towards the Research 
Station, and if any of them were curious about why they were doing 
this, they didn&#39;t ask aloud. Feral and Sakura acted as scouts, guiding 
them until they reached the inner line of defenses.

&quot;There&#39;s a gun emplacement on the other side of this hill,&quot; Sakura 
stated calmly, &quot;we can use it to access the inner line of defenses.&quot;

&quot;Why does this place have this kind of defenses?&quot; Feral asked 
disbelievingly.

&quot;The Xavier Protocols, maybe,&quot; Polaris answered quietly. At Plasma&#39;s 
inquiring glance she whispered, &quot;After an X-Man went bad a few years 
back, Xavier wrote a series of plans on how to take the members of the 
X-Men down if needed.&quot;

&quot;I wonder if that&#39;s our target,&quot; Plasma looked curiously at Sakura.

&quot;We&#39;ll be told when we need to know,&quot; Polaris shrugged.

Feral looked over at McCoy, &quot;Gimmie a boost.&quot; McCoy cupped his hands, 
Feral stepped in it delicately, and he practically tossed her over the 
rise at the cannon there.

There was a slicing sound, and McCoy grinned, &quot;My cue, I believe.&quot; He 
went over the hill, the others following quickly behind him. The mini- 
cannon lay on the ground, sliced away cleanly.

&quot;I hate getting grease on my nails,&quot; Feral wiped her claws on the 
grass.

&quot;Smoothly cut,&quot; McCoy said admiringly, quickly plugging his laptop in.

&quot;Why, thank you Doctor,&quot; Feral actually smiled at him.

&quot;You&#39;re awfully trusting of our fearless leader,&quot; Plasma and Polaris 
moved off to quietly resume their previous discussion.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Polaris smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;m just confident in our 
ability to handle whatever comes our way.&quot;

&quot;You got that right,&quot; Plasma agreed, letting fire dance along her 
fingers a moment.

Sakura stood back a bit, watching them interact. &#39;Things are 
progressing like we thought,&#39; she noted, &#39;Feral and McCoy are bonding 
in a psychopathic sort of way, while Plasma and Polaris&#39; basic decency 
pulls them closer together.&#39; She smiled coldly, &#39;Soon we&#39;ll be able to 
use one of them as leverage with the other, if needed.&#39;

&quot;The inner line&#39;s down,&quot; McCoy smiled, &quot;and quite quickly, if I do say 
so myself.&quot;

&quot;Keep under cover until we reach the main buildings themselves,&quot; 
Sakura ordered. &quot;There&#39;s human security in there, and I have no wish 
for one of them to raise the alarm,&quot; she added.

They moved on, carefully keeping out of the line of sight of anyone in 
the buildings. It took time, but in a few moments they reached the 
buildings themselves. &quot;McCoy,&quot; Polaris asked quietly, &quot;what sort of 
access do you need to shut down the buildings&#39; security?&quot;

&quot;I can clear some of it from an outside port,&quot; McCoy answered, &quot;but 
the rest will require a PC access inside.&quot;

Sakura shot Polaris a look, silently saying, &#39;Thank you for asking, 
but don&#39;t do it again.&#39; She then said to McCoy, &quot;Get to it.&quot; She 
turned back to the other three, &quot;Once were in, I do not want any of 
the security personnel killed.&quot;

&quot;Aaawwww!&quot; Feral wined.

&quot;I bet the X-Men will be after us just for busting in here,&quot; Plasma 
noted, &quot;we don&#39;t need to add any dead bodies to the score.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;ll get your shot at them later,&quot; Polaris added quietly.

Sakura quietly said to Feral, &quot;Don&#39;t disobey me.&quot; A gleaming shuriken 
appeared in her hand, seemingly by magic, &quot;You won&#39;t live long enough 
to regret it.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re good to go,&quot; McCoy appeared to say.

They moved in quietly, the five of them ready to move at a moment&#39;s 
notice. &quot;What&#39;s our target?&quot; Plasma asked, looking back and forth 
carefully.

&quot;McCoy,&quot; Sakura nodded to a nearby PC on a desk.

&quot;Who goes there?&quot; the man in a security uniform called from down the 
hall.

Before he could even move, a metal panel from the roof went liquid, 
forming a muzzle and bonds to restrain him. &quot;Gotcha,&quot; Polaris smirked.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Plasma shot her a smile.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Polaris nodded. She pulled two more roof panels apart, 
forming a belt, and two bracelets on her wrists.

&quot;What&#39;s that for?&quot; Feral asked with a smirk on her face.

&quot;Parts of this place have no iron in it,&quot; Polaris explained patiently, 
&quot;part of a defense against Magneto. This way, I&#39;m carrying something 
for my powers to work with.&quot;

McCoy finished up on the PC, &quot;The automatic defenses are all down. We 
only have to worry about the human security now.&quot;

&quot;Our target,&quot; Sakura looked over the other four, &quot;is the cold storage 
vault two levels below us. McCoy, I&#39;ll need your assistance to package 
the samples for transport. Polaris, Plasma, and Feral will be our 
cover.&quot;

&quot;Two levels down,&quot; Plasma noted. She looked over at Polaris, &quot;Can you 
tell me how thick the floor is here?&quot;

Polaris knelt down, generating a low level magnetic pulse, &quot;About a 
foot.&quot;

&quot;Everyone step back,&quot; Sakura cautioned the others.

Plasma glowed softly, focusing her concentration. Then a focused 
stream of fiery plasma radiated from her hands, cutting through the 
floor like a hot knife through butter. &quot;Instant shortcut,&quot; she smiled, 
adding, &quot;watch the edges, they&#39;re still hot.&quot;

Polaris picked up herself and Plasma, floating them down to the next 
level. Feral and McCoy leapt down easily, while Sakura just seemed to 
appear there.

&quot;How does she do that?&quot; Feral murmured quietly.

Completely deadpan McCoy answered her, &quot;Ninja mojo.&quot; Feral snickered 
softly at that.

Sakura did a quick check of the floorplan before saying, &quot;Cut down to 
the next level here, please. We don&#39;t want to risk any damage to the 
vault.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Plasma answered. Another fast burn later, and they were on 
the final level.

Sakura swiftly lead them down to the hall to a massive vault door. She 
typed a code in confidently, and a moment later the door opened, cold 
mist spilling out onto the floor. A computer terminal was sitting 
nearby the door, and she gestured McCoy towards it.

&quot;We want the cell samples from the X-Men, as well as any Summers clan 
DNA on file,&quot; Sakura instructed him.

McCoy typed on the terminal quickly, slots opening up on the walls of 
the vault revealing vials of DNA. &quot;I begin to understand,&quot; he smiled, 
&quot;material for my enhancements, maybe?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s possible,&quot; Sakura opened up a carrying case, sliding vials into 
cushioned slots.

A few moments, that&#39;s all it took to acquire what they had come for. 
Polaris hesitated when Sakura said it was time to go, asking her 
reluctantly, &quot;Should we make a try on the Protocols?&quot;

Sakura actually smiled, &quot;Thanks for the offer, but Stryfe specifically 
ordered me not to.&quot;

They returned to the waiting boat much faster, Polaris using her 
magnetism to fly them back, skimming low over the ground. They climbed 
into their craft, and it sat there silently for a moment. Outer 
segments fell away, and it skimmed over the waters before rising into 
the air. The mini- jet climbed, slowly disappearing into the sky as 
it&#39;s cloak activated.

Later that day Sakura entered Stryfe&#39;s chambers cautiously, waiting 
for the armored figure to see her. &quot;Come in,&quot; Stryfe said calmly.

Sakura carried the case in, laying it on the table. &quot;Mission 
accomplished,&quot; she said simply.

Stryfe opened it, looking at the vials, each carrying a precious cell 
sample. &quot;Good work,&quot; he smiled slightly.

&quot;A question, Lord Stryfe,&quot; Sakura waited for his nod before 
continuing, &quot;why didn&#39;t you want us to try to obtain the Xavier 
Protocols?&quot;

&quot;Because they are no longer valid,&quot; he said simply. &quot;The members of 
the X-Men have continued to grow and evolve since the Protociols were 
first written, and the composition of the teams has also greatly 
changed,&quot; Stryfe explained.

&quot;Sir,&quot; Sakura bowed her respect to him.

&quot;And this is far more precious,&quot; Stryfe ran his fingers along the 
vials, finally pulling it out. Her raised one to the light, the name 
on it reading, &#39;Katherine Pryde.&#39; With a slight smile Stryfe asked 
Sakura, &quot;How would you like to walk through walls?&quot;
