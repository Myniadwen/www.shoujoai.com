<a href="../nonanime/mechawars-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>        Biko grinned ferally, raising her wrist cannon and opening 
fire. The boomer exploded into flames, and she turned to fire again at 
another boomer coming up behind her. Eiko backed Biko up, her long red 
hair flowing around her as she punched and kicked the robots down.

        &quot;Not bad,&quot; Biko smiled, gracefully descending to the ground 
and standing beside Eiko and the four fully scrapped boomers.

        &quot;Not too bad yourself,&quot; Eiko agreed, reaching out to take her 
hand. They walked into a darker portion of the alley together, and 
Biko changed back into her school uniform.

        The two young women had been back in Mega-Tokyo only a few 
days, and had demolished more than a few boomers in that time. They 
had also been enjoying the night life, as well as starting to get to 
know each other a bit better, away from their families and friends.

        Biko smiled, pushing her long blue hair back from her face. 
&quot;The Priss and the Replicants concert last night was incredible, 
wasn&#39;t it?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;I was impressed,&quot; Eiko admitted with a laugh. &quot;That woman 
could sing,&quot; she added.

        &quot;The bar was a dive,&quot; Biko chuckled, &quot;but they were worth it.&quot;

        They walked on together for a few moments, then Eiko softly 
asked her, &quot;What are we going to do about Genom?&quot;

        &quot;My father won&#39;t do anything,&quot; Biko said softly, &quot;he doesn&#39;t 
dare. He&#39;d loose too much himself if he sued Genom for any damages.&quot;

        Eiko squeezed Biko&#39;s hand gently in her own and said, &quot;I 
didn&#39;t ask about your dad, what are we going to do?&quot;

        Biko stopped them, looking into Eiko&#39;s eyes as she quietly 
said, &quot;Would you like to share an little apartment in town with me?&quot; 
With a grim little smile on her face she added, &quot;I&#39;d like to stick 
around for a while, help out the Knight Sabers against Genom. It&#39;s the 
least I can do, for my father&#39;s men that those boomers killed.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d love to share an apartment with you,&quot; Eiko beamed, and 
gently kissed Eiko.

        KA-BOOM!

        The two jerked apart, eyes wide as the Earth shook beneath 
them. &quot;Did the Earth move for you, too?&quot; Biko asked with a grin.

        Eiko snickered softly, &quot;Guess we&#39;d better check that out.&quot;

        The two of them ran down the street, fighting against the 
press of people trying to go the opposite direction. They rounded a 
corner, and skidded to a stop as they both blinked in surprise.

        The young woman was surrounded by six massive combat boomers, 
but she didn&#39;t look too terribly afraid. Long, pink hair flowed down 
her back, and her face was clearly attractive, even looking as 
irritated as she did right about then. She protected a dark haired 
girl who lay on the ground right behind her, holding on to her forearm 
as if it greatly pained her, while a scrapped boomer lay at the pink 
haired woman&#39;s feet.

        &quot;You hurt my master,&quot; the pink haired girl said intensely, her 
body almost glowing with power, &quot;and that is simply unforgivable!&quot;

        The boomers didn&#39;t even know what hit them. The woman was a 
blur, striking fast and hard with immense strength against each 
boomer, leaving them smoking wrecks in her wake. They tried using 
their weapons, but they couldn&#39;t even get a shot off!

        &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re needed here,&quot; Biko said dryly.

        &quot;Looks like it,&quot; Eiko agreed.

        &quot;Are you all right, master?&quot; the pink haired girl asked after 
finishing off disposing of the boomers and returning to the dark 
haired girl&#39;s side.

        &quot;Thank you Kurumi, I&#39;m fine,&quot; the black haired woman said as 
she pushed up her round glasses a bit nervously.

        &quot;Master Nako thanked me,&quot; Kurumi threw her arms around Nako 
and hugged her fiercely. She let her go and began to bounce up and 
down chanting, &quot;Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!&quot;

        &quot;Kurumi,&quot; Nako tried to stop her, &quot;those girls are staring at 
us.&quot;

        Kurumi looked over at the visibly goggling Eiko and Biko and 
beamed at the two of them happily, &quot;That&#39;s because they&#39;re jealous of 
what a great master Kurumi has!&quot; With that, she hugged Nako&#39;s body 
close to her once again.

        Eiko smiled, shaking her head as she softly said the Japanese 
word for cute, &quot;Kawaii.&quot;

        &quot;Definitely,&quot; Biko agreed quietly.

        &quot;Hi!&quot; Kurumi waved at the two of them cheerfully, still 
holding on to Nako, the young woman&#39;s face nearly in her bust.

        &quot;Hello,&quot; Nako waved weakly, her face beet red.

        The introductions were quickly made, and Biko asked Kurumi and 
Nako curiously, &quot;So why were the boomers after you two?&quot;

        &quot;Boomers?&quot; Kurumi looked cutely blank.

        &quot;Those mean robots,&quot; Nako gently supplied. She looked over at 
Biko and answered, &quot;We&#39;re not sure, actually.&quot;

        &quot;Well, whatever they were after,&quot; Eiko smiled, &quot;they didn&#39;t 
get it.&quot;

        Across town, the Genom tower rose up over the city, casting a 
long shadow on all of Mega-Tokyo&#39;s people. A massive structure of 
blue-gray metal, it was the fortress from which it&#39;s leader attempted 
to rule over the city. A leader who didn&#39;t look particularly happy 
right about then.

        &quot;All ten boomers were destroyed?&quot; Quincy echoed softly.

        Madigan winced, checking her notes to buy herself from time. 
The information hadn&#39;t changed much, sadly. &quot;The attack team of six 
and the four observers were all destroyed,&quot; she reported regretfully, 
&quot;we believe by separate parties.&quot;

        &quot;Did we get any data on them?&quot; Quincy&#39;s voice had dropped to a 
dangerous purr.

        &quot;As a precaution I had a recon drone follow them,&quot; Madigan 
said a bit smugly, &quot;this is what it recorded before it was clipped by 
a piece of flying debris.&quot;

        The two women on the image tore through the four boomers like 
the wind, twin engines of destruction. &quot;Rewind,&quot; Quincy ordered, then 
&quot;stop, enhance image!&quot;

        The figure in battle armor looked quite familiar, as the 
design was based around a one-piece bathing suit. &quot;Biko,&quot; Madigan 
growled softly.

        It had been a grave mistake, Quincy now knew, to bring Biko 
and her red-headed little friend to Mega-Tokyo.

        An super-deformed Eiko popped up and waved her arms angrily as 
she protested, &quot;Her red headed little friend? I do have a name, you 
know! Jerk.&quot;

        Quincy blinked, looking over at Madigan, &quot;Did you see that?&quot;

        &quot;See what?&quot; Madigan asked.

        &quot;Never mind,&quot; Quincy sighed, making a little metal note to cut 
down on his meds. Once Biko had found out about Genom&#39;s illegal 
activities, she began to push her father to try to sue Genom for 
damages. She failed, of course, because her father was far too 
dependent on several contracts from Genom itself, but now she was here 
in Mega-Tokyo, causing trouble.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say there was no scan data on our primary 
target,&quot; Madigan added softly.

        &quot;We need to find the Steel Angel,&quot; Quincy said intensely, &quot;it 
could revolutionize the entire line of boomers! Send out another 
retrieval team immediately!&quot;

        Madigan cleared her throat softly, and Quincy looked up at her 
curiously. &quot;We don&#39;t have enough in the covert budget to launch 
another try,&quot; she said sheepishly.

        For a moment you could actually hear Quincy grinding his teeth 
together. &quot;Sell off some of my Genom stock,&quot; he growled, &quot;I&#39;ll buy it 
back later.&quot;

        &quot;Right, sir,&quot; Madigan nodded, even as she thought wryly, &#39;He 
always says he&#39;ll buy the stock back, but he never seems to.&#39;

        &quot;I must acquire the Steel Angel,&quot; Quincy muttered softly as 
she left the room.

        In another part of the city a computer terminal softly went 
&#39;ping,&#39; Sylia reluctantly climbed out of the hot tub and walked over 
to check it, giving Tony quite an entertaining view of her naked 
backside along with a softly mumbled, &quot;Excuse me.&quot; She reviewed the 
bulletin and a little frown appeared on her face.

        &quot;Something wrong?&quot; Tony asked, relaxing in the bubbles.

        &quot;Quincy&#39;s selling more Genom stock,&quot; Sylia noted, authorizing 
the purchase through one of her various dummy companies.

        Tony eased herself up out of the tub and onto the shelf around 
it, &quot;Which means he needs money for something nefarious, no doubt.&quot; 
Her one leg dandled in the water, the stump of her other leg a healthy 
pink beside it.

        Sylia nodded, &quot;Exactly.&quot;

        &quot;Your and Nene&#39;s suits are still mostly gutted,&quot; Tony said 
thoughtfully, &quot;but we could probably get Linna and Priss&#39;s suits 
operational.&quot; She reached over to grab her oversized T-shirt and 
slipped it on over her nude body, covering the scars on her side and 
shoulder.

        Sylia shook her head, &quot;Let&#39;s complete all the refits first.&quot; 
At Tony&#39;s mildly surprised look she added, &quot;Nene tells me that 
Nuku-nuku and Emi had a great old time destroying boomers yesterday, 
and I know that both Biko and Eiko are in town. Let&#39;s let them handle 
it first, and the Knight Sabers can step in later if needed.&quot;

        Tony pulled her prosthetic leg over and attached it, standing 
up a bit shakily. &quot;I think you may be right. If necessary, I can don 
my armor and head out to help,&quot; she smiled.

        Sylia walked over to her lover, taking her hand gently, &quot;Only 
if you have to, love. I know how much it hurts you to wear that suit 
with your injuries.&quot;

        Toy drew Sylia&#39;s hand up to her lips, kissing it gently. &quot;We 
all do what we must, m&#39;lady,&quot; she said softly, a twinkle in her eyes 
as she looked Sylia up and down.

        Sylia looked down and blushed, realizing she was still nude. 
&quot;I&#39;ll go get dressed,&quot; she started to move, but Tony kept a firm grip 
on her hand. Sylia looked into Tony&#39;s eyes, and found them warm with 
admiration and desire.

        &quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; Tony murmured, a quirky smile on her 
face.

        Sylia smiled back, and pressed her lips to Tony&#39;s.
