<h1>Slayer and Shadow (part 22 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>There was a wet sound as the creature&#39;s bones broke,
the green scailly monster reeling back in surprise.
Before it could recover Willow raced in close, the
sword the red-brown haired vampiress wielded gleaming
as she cut deeply into the inhuman flesh.

&quot;Here comes some more of them,&quot; Willow said fiercely,
her long black leather coat swirling around her as she
saw the things scrambling out of the filthy wreck of a
building.

&quot;So these things were building a nest?&quot; Buffy asked,
the butchy blonde kicking out to drop another of the
hideous things, wincing a bit at the foul smell
wafting off them. It was almost enough to make you
gag.

&quot;If they&#39;re given the chance,&quot; Giles agreed, puffing
slightly as he pushed up his glasses on his nose then
swung at another one of the beasts. His axe sent the
thing reeling, then Faith moved in to finish it off.

&quot;G-Man, be more careful,&quot; Faith noted, her brown hair
flowing as she pulled the pike from the creature&#39;s
chest.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Giles sighed.

&quot;I&#39;m so glad Dawn is off with Miss Calendar,&quot; Buffy
sighed as they decapitated another of the lurching
things, &quot;at least she&#39;s out of trouble.&quot;

&quot;Why do I think you&#39;re going to regret saying that?&quot;
Willow asked wryly, gracefully moving to back up
Faith.

The sound of a fire alarm wailed as Jenny Calendar
calmly hosed down the oven with the fire extinguisher,
the foam spraying everywhere. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Dawn sighed
from where she stood nearby, the young lady looking
rather sheepish.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Jenny said as she casually tossed
the fire extinguisher aside, &quot;we&#39;ll just have to get
take out for tonight.&quot; She gave Dawn a thoughtful look
as she asked her, &quot;You&#39;ve never made a cake?&quot;

&quot;No, not really,&quot; Dawn admitted sheepishly. &quot;Usually
it was just my dad&#39;s girlfriends cooking for us.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll see what I can do about teaching you,&quot;
Jenny said as she opened the windows to let some of
the smoke out.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Dawn smiled shyly. A pause, &quot;I wanted to
make a treat for Buffy, since she does so much to take
care of me...&quot;

&quot;I make Giles brownies as a treat,&quot; Jenny winked ay
her impishly as she continued briskly, &quot;I can relate.&quot;

Ah CHOO! Giles suddenly sneezed, blinking in surprise
as his glasses nearly fell right off of his face.

&quot;Heads up!&quot; Buffy moved to block the creature&#39;s
swinging claws, then lunged forward to slice at it
with her blade.

&quot;Dreadfully sorry,&quot; Giles apologized to her even as he
took up his axe and beheaded it, gore splattering his
clothes.

&quot;You okay?&quot; Faith asked.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Giles reassured them, puffing tiredly. &quot;I
never quite realized how out of shape I am,&quot; he
confessed.

Willow glided over, the corpses of the nest of
creatures scattered on the road all around them.
&quot;Maybe Faith and Willow can take you jogging,&quot; she
said dryly, her eyes twinkling with concealed
amusement.

&quot;Oh lovely,&quot; Giles sighed as he shook himself, leaning
up against the wall. &quot;This is the last nest?&quot; he asked
them.

&quot;According to the source Wills and I shook down, yes,&quot;
Buffy agreed, picking up a ragged piece of cloth and
cleaning her blade.

&quot;Remind me to hit the bars with you guys one time,&quot;
Faith noted, &quot;beating up minor demons sounds like
fun.&quot;

&quot;Tara all right?&quot; Willow asked her quietly, noting the
absence of the other woman on their hunting
expedition.

&quot;Working,&quot; Faith gave a faintly pained look, &quot;I think
she&#39;s trying very hard not to think about Amy.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t really blame her,&quot; Giles admitted, taking off
his glasses and cleaning them with a handkerchief from
his pocket. &quot;You don&#39;t think she&#39;d do anything
foolish?&quot; he asked mildly, looking at Faith with
concern.

&quot;If we knew where to find Amy and Dru I&#39;d be worried,&quot;
Faith admitted, &quot;but since we don&#39;t, she should be
fine.&quot;

&quot;Jenny&#39;s keeping an eye on her too, in a motherly sort
of way,&quot; Willow noted, her expression unusually
closed. Not that it wasn&#39;t understandable, considering
that her actions as a soulless vampire had been the
cause of their current situation.

&quot;Don&#39;t start with that,&quot; Buffy elbowed Willow not so
gently in the ribs.

&quot;Heh,&quot; watching them Giles felt himself smiling
slightly. As much as the Watcher wanted to maintain
his initial suspicion of the reformed vampiress, more
and more he had been won over by her various noble
actions.

&quot;I just wish I knew how these things got here,&quot; Faith
frowned as she looked back at the now dissolving green
corpses.

&quot;They aren&#39;t native, no,&quot; Giles conceded, &quot;I&#39;ll have
to look into it.&quot;

Meanwhile, in a cavern far beneath the city two women
watched catlike as their minion finished their report,
&quot;...then the Cenobites were all killed,&quot; the young man
sighed.\

&quot;All of them?&quot; Amy sat up, the sexy blonde looking
indignant.

&quot;All four nests,&quot; the vampire boy confessed.

&quot;And we went to such trouble getting them here, too,&quot;
Dru pouted, her dark colored hair a glittering wave.
She gave him a look, &quot;I&#39;m very disappointed, Jesse.&quot;

Jesse took a half step backwards, &quot;Ma&#39;am...?&quot;

&quot;May I?&quot; Amy asked.

&quot;Please do,&quot; Dru sat back with a cat-like smile.

Amy gestured, a inhuman word ripped from her lips and
Jessie cried out before flames consumed him, in
moments leaving only charred ashes in his wake. &quot;Clean
that up,&quot; she coldly ordered another vamp as she lay
back on the bed she shared with Dru.

&quot;Of course,&quot; he bowed.

&quot;Did anyone catch that human vampire hunter?&quot; Dru
asked irritably.

Another vampire, his skin glossy black purred, &quot;Of
course ma&#39;am. You know you can rely on Mr Trick.&quot; He
dragged the struggling woman forward, tossing her at
their feet, &quot;All wrapped and ready to go.&quot;

&quot;Hmmph,&quot; the gagged, reddish brown haired woman made a
incoherent sound as she hit the ground, her hunter&#39;s
gear tattered and torn.

&quot;Ungag her,&quot; Amy ordered Trick, watching the man
cruelly tear the gag away.

&quot;You&#39;ll...,&quot; the woman gasped, &quot;never get away with
this!&quot;

&quot;Why is it they always say things like that?&quot; Dru
asked the others dryly, &quot;We&#39;ve already gotten away
with it.&quot;

&quot;Who are you, little hunter?&quot; Amy asked, turning her
almost hypnotic gaze on her.

&quot;Justine Cooper,&quot; the young woman reluctantly said.

&quot;Cooper?&quot; Dru blinked, &quot;We have a Cooper.&quot;

A slow smile spread across Amy&#39;s lips, &quot;Someone, go
get Julia.&quot;

A few moments later a young woman appeared from the
tunnels, almost a mirror image except for seeming to
be younger. &quot;Justine,&quot; she cried as the smiling woman
hurried over to the bound woman&#39;s side.

&quot;Julia?&quot; Justine whispered, looking at her twin in
shock.

&quot;I&#39;m here to help you,&quot; Julia whispered as she knelt
by her side.

&quot;But you&#39;re a vampire?&quot; Justine sounded justifiably
confused as Julia gently pulled her to her feet.

Julia smiled, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;

Justine pulled her close, tears in her eyes, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m
so glad you&#39;re back.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Julia sighed as she pressed her body close,
opened up her mouth then bit down on Justine&#39;s neck.

&quot;I love a happy ending,&quot; Dru said with a smirk as they
watched one sister eagerly drain the life from
another.

&quot;Why...?&quot; Justine managed.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Julia purred as she bent to kiss her
sister with bloody lips, &quot;in a few days, we&#39;ll be
together forever.&quot;

To be continued...

Notes: Justine Cooper was a vampire hunter from the
Angel series, who lost her sister to a vampire attack.
