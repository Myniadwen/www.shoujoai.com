<h1>Slayer and Shadow (part 7 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>        Willow left Tara once they reached the town itself, letting 
the intense wiccan return to her usual post over at the Bronze. She 
knew that the woman was probably shaken by what she had heard that 
night, about the other world and her life there, not that Willow 
could really blame her. She still had a hard time accepting it all!

        Walking through the town of Sunnydale Willow kept her eyes 
open, the vampiress letting all her senses reach out into the 
darkness. The long leather coat swirled around her legs, her leather 
fetish wear clinging to her long slim body. The reddish brown hair 
swirled around her pale face, blown back by the slight breeze.

        &#39;It&#39;s so quiet,&#39; Willow thought, for just a moment wishing 
that there was some foolish vampire wandering out there in the 
night. She was tense, and part of her really wanted to hurt 
something. She reached the mansion that she and Buffy were using as 
their base of operations, entering almost silently through the front 
door.

        Buffy was pacing the living-room, her blonde hair tied back. 
She grinned and ran to Willow as soon as she saw her, &quot;Are you all 
right? The wiccan&#39;s didn&#39;t hurt you, did they?&quot;

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Willow gasped softly as Buffy threw her arms around 
her. She felt a sudden lash of warmth, and realized exactly why she 
was feeling cranky. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said softly as she gently pushed 
Buffy away. She smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to worry you.&quot;

        Buffy gave Willow a scolding look, &quot;If you hadn&#39;t come back 
here soon, I would have had to go in there after you.&quot; Impatiently 
she asked, &quot;So what did they want?&quot;

        &quot;To find out how I had regained my soul,&quot; Willow softly 
explained. Her expression was pained as she softly added, &quot;I met an 
old friend there, one I tried to kill.&quot;

        Buffy blinked, trying to match those two odd statements 
together. &quot;You didn&#39;t have your soul when you tried to kill your 
friend,&quot; she finally said softly, &quot;it wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Willow sighed softly. She had the oddest look on her 
face, &quot;She wasn&#39;t even angry with me about it, just calm.&quot;

        Suddenly, in the silence Buffy&#39;s stomach gurgled.

        &quot;You haven&#39;t eaten yet?&quot; Willow chuckled softly. They walked 
towards the kitchen together, &quot;Let&#39;s see what&#39;s in the fridge.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Buffy blushed slightly. She smiled impishly at 
Willow, &quot;I was going to hit a fast food joint, but I didn&#39;t want you 
lecturing me again.&quot;

        Willow chuckled to herself softly, &quot;And you don&#39;t cook, do 
you?&quot; She put some hamburgers on, slicing up a bit of tomatoes and 
onions as she softly murmured, &quot;Maybe you should get a wife to help 
take care of you.&quot;

        &quot;I thought I already had,&quot; Buffy gave Willow a little smile.

        A slight blush appeared on Willow&#39;s cheeks. She flipped the 
burgers, feeling a pang of hunger stirring within her, but not a 
hunger for blood. &quot;Don&#39;t tease, please,&quot; Willow murmured, &quot;you never 
know what might happen.&quot;

        &quot;Oh really?&quot; Buffy&#39;s eyes twinkled with amusement. She 
leaned on the counter by Willow, her T-shirt pulling tightly across 
her firm breasts. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be all that bothered by 
whatever happened ,&quot; she softly murmured.

        Willow gave her a gently scolding look, but she kept her 
mouth firmly shut. Buffy pouted cutely, and in a few moments Willow 
dished up the burgers for her. As Buffy ate her meal Willow took out 
a blood packet out of the metal case in the bottom of the fridge, 
pouring it into a mug then putting it in the microwave.

        &quot;You should be more careful,&quot; Willow finally said, keeping 
her eyes focused on the microwave, &quot;my self control isn&#39;t always as 
good as I&#39;d like.&quot;

        Buffy polished off one of her hamburgers, then she picked up 
the other. &quot;You don&#39;t need to control yourself so much, Willow,&quot; she 
said to her gently.

        &quot;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re asking,&quot; Willow quietly 
murmured, taking the mug out of the microwave oven and stirring it a 
bit. Her face flickered, becoming more vampiric as she drank the mug 
of blood down in one pull.

        &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; Buffy put the burger down on her plate. She got 
up from her seat, gently putting her hand on Willow&#39;s arm, &quot;You 
wanted to give me some time, and I appreciate that. But I think I 
know what I want, Willow.&quot;

        &quot;You...&quot; Willow started.

        Buffy leaned forward, kissing Willow gently on the lips. 
There was a slight taste of blood there, but the slim blonde 
continued on, her tongue seeking in that warm mouth. Willow stood 
there stiffly for a moment, then she gently wrapped her arms around 
Buffy&#39;s body.

        &quot;I shouldn&#39;t,&quot; Willow murmured softly, but anything else 
that she was going to say was cut off by another fierce kiss.

        &quot;You should,&quot; was Buffy&#39;s quiet answer.

        Willow shuddered, feeling Buffy&#39;s hands cupping her 
shoulders, stroking along the base of her throat then down the front 
of her leather dress. &quot;Oh goddess,&quot; she murmured softly, a breathy 
moan escaping as fingers found her breasts.

        &quot;Your skin is so cool,&quot; Buffy whispered her discovery, her 
hands still seeking gently. She bent forward, pressing her lips to 
the cool skin that was exposed at the throat as she continued to 
tease surprisingly pointy nipples.

        &quot;I&#39;m.. always just a bit cooler than a normal person,&quot; 
Willow managed to answer breathlessly. Her legs were getting so 
weak, she leaned up against the kitchen counter for support.

        Buffy drew back a bit, letting her fingers stop their play. 
She gently cupped Willow&#39;s sides as she softly murmured, &quot;This would 
be a lot more fun in the bedroom.&quot; Buffy smiled slightly, &quot;Unless 
you really don&#39;t want me to continue?&quot;

        Willow smiled shyly, &quot;I don&#39;t want to stop.&quot;

        The two young women walked back through the halls towards 
Willow&#39;s bedroom together, holding each other&#39;s hand. The vampiress 
cast her long leather coat aside, revealing even more of her pale 
shoulders, those long, long legs encased in the skintight leather 
pants. Buffy flipped the light switch, but oddly the lights in the 
room didn&#39;t turn on. Willow struck a match, and lit a few candles 
that were placed around the room, giving it a soft romantic glow.

        &quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Buffy murmured, looking at the large bed 
in the middle of the room, the walls hung with woven tapestries 
collected from around the mansion.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Willow began to unlace the top of her leather 
dress. In a few seconds leather cords hung free, and she smiled at 
Buffy gently, &quot;Would you care to do the honors?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Buffy stepped up, placing her hands on the 
two pieces that made up the leather top. Gently she pulled them 
apart, the laces pulling from the holes, until the sections dropped 
to the floor revealing creamy pale skin.

        &quot;You&#39;re a bit overdressed,&quot; the now topless Willow moved a 
bit nearer to Buffy. She took the bottom of the Slayer&#39;s T-shirt in 
her hands, tugging it upwards and over her head. Restrained in a 
simple white bra the woman&#39;s breasts strained to be free. Willow 
reached around, finding the hooks and releasing them into the air.

        &quot;Ooh,&quot; Buffy shuddered as cool skin pressed against her, 
then moaned softly as fingers teased at the already sensitive 
breasts.

        &quot;Turnabout is fair play,&quot; Willow murmured softly in her ear.

        Willow slid her cool hands down Buffy&#39;s sides, coming to a 
stop at the button of the woman&#39;s jeans. Buffy nodded slightly, and 
Willow unbuttoned and zipped the pants, quickly discovering two 
things: Buffy was indeed a natural blonde, and she wasn&#39;t wearing 
any underwear.

        &quot;I took them off when I came home,&quot; Buffy&#39;s voice had a 
throaty quality to it, &quot;I wanted to be ready when you got here.&quot;

        Willow leaned forward from where she knelt in front of Buffy 
and pressed a single chaste kiss to that blonde mound. She rose like 
a cat, gently bringing Buffy&#39;s hands to her own waist, &quot;Help me get 
these off.&quot; It took some wiggling to get the leather pants off her, 
but in moments they fell to the floor beside Buffy&#39;s jeans.

        &quot;I love you,&quot; Buffy murmured as she drew Willow down onto 
the bed.

        &quot;And I, you,&quot; Willow kissed her, savoring the moment.
