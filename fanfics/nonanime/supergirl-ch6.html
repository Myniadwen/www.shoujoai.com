<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 6 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/supergirl-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre> Bruce Wayne stepped out of the elevator and sighed to himself softly. 
&quot;You know that you&#39;re allowed in the cave, Helena. So why do you keep 
insisting on sneaking in?&quot; he asked as he walked to the young woman 
lounging in his chair.

&quot;The challenge, I guess,&quot; the black haired girl shrugged. Helena was a 
bit dusty, especially around her knees and elbows.

&quot;How did you break in this time?&quot; Bruce asked her with a sigh. The 
monitors in front of them were showing images of the new Supergirl and 
Steel in action, as well as a few other heroes who had recently returned 
to action.

&quot;I used the caves that opened up after the Cataclysm,&quot; she shrugged, 
&quot;you haven&#39;t been able to seal up all of them.&quot;

&quot;I thought the remaining ones were too small,&quot; Bruce looked over at her 
thoughtfully, &quot;I guess I was wrong.&quot;

&quot;Keep trying, Gramps,&quot; Helena Wayne grinned. &quot;What do you think of 
them?&quot; she asked, waving at the monitors.

&quot;Not enough discipline,&quot; he noted, &quot;but they do have potential.&quot;

&quot;Potential, right,&quot; she smiled. Helena took a breath, &quot;Would you object 
to my becoming involved with them?&quot;

Bruce raised his eyebrow, appearing mildly surprised at his notoriously 
independent granddaughter, &quot;I absolutely forbid it.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Helena looked surprised. &quot;And why not?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;You&#39;re still far too inexperienced,&quot; Bruce said to her levelly, &quot;and I 
doubt you could handle the responsibility.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re wrong,&quot; Helena scowled, &quot;and you know it!&quot; She picked up a black 
and purple costume from the floor, declaring, &quot;I&#39;ve been operating as 
Kestrel for over two years, now. When are you going to start treating me 
like an adult?&quot;

&quot;When you start acting like one,&quot; Bruce answered calmly.

Helena growled something incoherent, and turned to stride to the 
elevator. The door slid open then shut right behind her, cutting off her 
fierce glare. The elevator rose silently, while Bruce settled down into 
his chair.

&quot;That was a fairly blatant use of reverse psychology,&quot; Oracle noted, her 
holographic image materializing beside him.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Bruce actually smiled up at her impishly, &quot;but with Helena it&#39;s 
one of the few things that usually works.&quot;

&quot;I remember,&quot; Oracle smiled slightly.

Bruce actually looked a bit uncomfortable, &quot;I don&#39;t think I ever thanked 
you, for helping raise her after her father died.&quot; His eyes darkened 
with remembered pain, &quot;My son...&quot;

&quot;You should really be thanking Barbara and Dinah,&quot; Oracle reminded him 
gently. She flickered a moment, &quot;Sorry, duty calls.&quot; With that, she was 
gone.

Elsewhere in the city, later that day, Helena paced the small apartment 
while waving her hands in the air, &quot;I can&#39;t believe that man!&quot; She had 
changed to a black T-shirt and jeans, and made quite the striking 
figure.

Dinah Lance and her wife, Barbara Gordon-Lance watched her with a 
parent&#39;s fondness. Dinah&#39;s blonde hair was lightly touched with gray, 
but other than that she was young and vigorous due to a bath in the 
life- extending Lazarus Pit.

Barbara&#39;s fiery red hair flowed over her shoulders as she carefully 
walked across the room carrying a tray of coffee. The metallic braces on 
her legs allowed the formerly crippled woman to walk, a gift of Wayne 
enterprises and Bruce himself.

&quot;Trust me, I know how irritating your grandfather can be,&quot; Dinah 
grinned. &quot;So what did he do this time?&quot;

&quot;Said I was too immature to try to hook up with Supergirl and Steel,&quot; 
Helena scowled.

&quot;Don&#39;t make that face too long, it might stay that way,&quot; Barbara set the 
cups down, sitting down to snuggle with Dinah.

Helena blinked in surprise, then laughed softly, &quot;Thanks, Mom.&quot; She 
flopped down in the chair opposite, &quot;So what do you think?&quot;

&quot;You can do this,&quot; Barbara nodded firmly. She was almost as youthful as 
Dinah, due to an emergency blood transfusion Dinah had given her. 
Somehow, the effects of the Lazarus Pit had been shared between them 
both.

&quot;You are as good as I ever was,&quot; Dinah agreed, &quot;maybe better.&quot; She shook 
her head, &quot;I just don&#39;t understand the man&#39;s problem.&quot;

&quot;I think I do,&quot; Barbara sighed.

&quot;What?&quot; Helena sat up, looking at her curiously.

&quot;Back when I started out as Batgirl, it took a lot of doing to prove 
myself to Batman,&quot; Barbara explained, &quot;and I think it was because, as 
heroic as Bruce is, he has an old fashioned view of women. Ladies should 
be protected, not out doing the fighting.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to get a sex change,&quot; Helena scowled,

Dinah nearly choked on her coffee on that, and Barbara snickered. &quot;Don&#39;t 
do that, you&#39;ll disappoint all the girl&#39;s who haven&#39;t gone out with you 
yet,&quot; Dinah grinned.

&quot;That&#39;s the truth,&quot; Barbara agreed. She leaned forward, &quot;But if you 
really want to do this, then go for it. Bruce will approve or not, but 
don&#39;t let that influence your decision.&quot;

&quot;I do want to,&quot; Helena nodded. She frowned, &quot;Now how do I get up there? 
Could always sneak in...&quot;

&quot;I think there might be a better way,&quot; Dinah said, looking thoughtfully 
at Barbara.

Barbara nodded thoughtfully, &quot;Help me up.&quot; With Dinah&#39;s aide she got up 
out of the couch, then walked over to the antique computer system she 
had set up in the corner of the living room.

&quot;You don&#39;t mean to hack them with that piece of junk?&quot; Helena exclaimed.

&quot;Watch your tongue, junior,&quot; and Barbara&#39;s tone was actually scolding as 
she added, &quot;this was state of the art in it&#39;s day.&quot; She typed furiously, 
activating subsystems until she was asked for a password. She typed it 
in, blushing faintly, &#39;Babs loves Dinah.&#39;

&quot;Aww,&quot; Dinah smiled.

A soft hum, and a three dimensional hologram appeared in their midst, 
looking like a younger version of Barbara herself. &quot;Oracle access 
granted,&quot; Oracle declared. She looked around thoughtfully, &quot;Hello 
Barbara, Dinah.&quot; She took a moment, &quot;Helena! You&#39;ve grown since I last 
saw you.&quot;

Helena gaped at her in surprise, and Dinah looked at the hologram 
thoughtfully. &quot;Hello, Oracle,&quot; she said quietly.

&quot;Dinah,&quot; Oracle nodded, a deep emotion flickering in her eyes.

&quot;Hello, Oracle. Helena is interested in joining this new Justice League 
you and the others are forming,&quot; Barbara smiled.

Oracle chuckled softly, &quot;Supergirl and Steel were looking into 
contacting her, actually.&quot; She looked at Helena thoughtfully, &quot;Do you 
have your costume?&quot;

Helena picked up her backpack from beside her chair, &quot;Now I do.&quot;

&quot;Step near me,&quot; Oracle said. As Helena did Oracle declared, 
&quot;Transmitting coordinates,&quot; and they both simply disappeared.</pre>
