<h1>Slayer and Shadow (part 12 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>        The creatures came out of the darkness as a group, moving 
forward in two bands to try and capture the vampire slayers in between 
them. &quot;Do you think they intended to set a trap,&quot; Giles murmured, the 
brown haired Englishman pushing his glasses up, &quot;or was it a 
coincidence?&quot;

        &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Faith flashed a smile, the black haired Slayer 
ready to go..

        &quot;No, it doesn&#39;t,&quot; Buffy agreed, a dangerous sort of eagerness 
coming over the smaller blonde, &quot;it won&#39;t save them.&quot;

        Willow kept eerily silent as she moved gracefully, almost 
inhumanly fast as she easily dodged the vampire&#39;s first blow, striking 
upwards in a smooth motion to rock him backwards. The stake was in her 
hand as the reddish brown haired vampire struck, a fine cloud of ashes 
blowing around her as he was reduced to dust.

        &quot;Fancy,&quot; Faith muttered, quickly staking another of the vamps 
after hammering it down into the ground with a loud thump.

        There was a flash of light and flames suddenly exploded to life 
around a vampire that had nearly reached the startled Giles. Tara 
gestured, the flames disappearing as fast as she called them up as she 
coldly said, &quot;Watch yourself, Mr. Giles.&quot;

        &quot;Ah, thank you,&quot; Giles stammered.

        &quot;You two get along,&quot; Buffy chided them with a amused smile as 
she kicked the final vamp against the wall, stepping in to stake it with 
remarkable ease.

        &quot;Looks like a good night&#39;s haul,&quot; Willow noted, the vampiress 
stepping up beside her lover. She smiled at Buffy, &quot;You all right?&quot;

        &quot;Just fine,&quot; Buffy smiled black, her blonde hair falling into 
her eyes.

        &quot;That was so cool,&quot; Dawn gushed, the brown haired younger girl 
emerging from the shadows where she had been hidden.

        &quot;Tara, G-man,&quot; Faith smiled wryly at the two, &quot;I don&#39;t think 
you&#39;ve met Buffy&#39;s younger sister, Dawn Summers.&quot;

        &quot;Hello,&quot; Giles said stiffly, then he looked over at the three 
women, &quot;Who&#39;s bright idea was it to bring her on patrol?&quot;

        Tara looked at Dawn thoughtfully before saying, &quot;You have to 
admit it&#39;s not a good idea to leave her alone all night.&quot;

        &quot;Well, yes,&quot; Giles grit his teeth, &quot;but still....&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you Tara,&quot; Dawn smiled up at Tara winningly 
with the unerring ability of any young woman had to find a possible 
ally.

        Tara smiled wryly, the brown haired woman chuckling softly. &quot;You 
too, Dawn,&quot; she agreed, shaking the girl&#39;s hand.

        &quot;G. looks like he&#39;s going to have kittens,&quot; Faith muttered to 
Buffy and Willow, the three young women watching with amusement.

        &quot;That kind of stress can&#39;t be good for him,&quot; Buffy said with an 
impish smile.

        &quot;You too are terrible, you know that?&quot; Willow fought back a 
smile.

        Giles had to smile slightly, shaking his head at the girls&#39; 
behavior. &quot;All right,&quot; he said, &quot;but the child&#39;s welfare is important, 
you know.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not a child,&quot; Dawn frowned, &quot;I&#39;m nearly fourteen.&quot;

        &quot;I strand corrected,&quot; Giles murmured.

        Faith looked over at Dawn thoughtfully for a moment, then she 
suddenly kicked out at the smaller girl. Drawing on self-defense courses 
from her school Dawn blocked the strike instinctively, though with a 
soft gasp of effort.

        &quot;What was that for?!&quot; Buffy blurted.

        &quot;Kid&#39;s got potential,&quot; Faith shrugged, &quot;she may not be a slayer 
but we can get her trained well enough to take care of herself.&quot;

        &quot;So who&#39;s going to train me?&quot; Dawn blinked, absorbing this.

        &quot;B. and I,&quot; Faith shrugged, &quot;ably assisted by the G-man and 
Willow, I figure.&quot;

        &quot;You mind?&quot; Buffy asked Dawn thoughtfully.

        &quot;As long as you two aren&#39;t too tough on me,&quot; Dawn managed a weak 
smile.

        They resumed their patrol, Dawn and Giles standing safely in the 
center of the formation. Willow studied Faith thoughtfully, taking a 
moment to quietly ask her, &quot;Why did you decide to include me in these 
training sessions?&quot;

        Faith tossed her a slight smile, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want my girlfriend 
spending time with another lady, even with Giles and Dawn chaperoning.&quot;

        By the look on her face Willow hadn&#39;t been expecting that 
answer, and Faith chuckled softly. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Willow said with a wry 
smile, moving over towards Buffy again. At Buffy&#39;s questioning glance 
she said, &quot;I have to remember not to underestimate her.&quot;

        &quot;We Slayers are full of surprises,&quot; Buffy smirked as she 
murmured, &quot;do you remember when I turned the tables on you the other 
night?&quot;

        &quot;Buffy!&quot; Willow scolded, Dawn listening eagerly.

        &quot;You two are really in love,&quot; Dawn murmured. She smiled, a bit 
of a blush appearing on her cheeks as she added, &quot;You might want to keep 
it down, though.&quot;

        It took Buffy and Willow a moment to get what Dawn was saying, 
then both of their cheeks went different shades of rose. &quot;And what were 
you doing listening in, little sis?&quot; Buffy finally managed to get out 
past her embarrassment.

        &quot;I wasn&#39;t doing it intentionally,&quot; Dawn said with wounded 
dignity, &quot;the amount of noise you were making could have waked the 
dead.&quot;

        Not far away Tara studied Dawn thoughtfully, the oddest look on 
the woman&#39;s face. &quot;Is there something amiss?&quot; Giles ventured 
tentatively.

        &quot;No,&quot; Tara gave him a withering look, &quot;at least, I don&#39;t think 
so.&quot;

        &quot;Ah, right,&quot; Giles backed away quickly.

        Faith smiled wryly, moving over to be nearer to Tara. &quot;You mind 
not spooking the Watcher?&quot; she said dryly. &quot;He has enough problems, I 
think,&quot; she added.

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Tara replied stubbornly.

        &quot;You really don&#39;t like him, do you?&quot; Faith asked.

        &quot;I don&#39;t like Watchers,&quot; Tara said firmly. She looked at Giles 
thoughtfully and added, &quot;I haven&#39;t decided if he&#39;s any better than the 
usual type.&quot;

        &quot;And what do you think of Slayers?&quot; Faith asked curiously, a 
dangerous little smile lingering for a second on her face.

        Tara looked at her, honestly confused. &quot;I have no problems with 
Slayers, &quot; she finally said, &quot;even though Buffy seems to be showing poor 
judgment.&quot;

        &quot;You opening up the Bronze later?&quot; Faith changed the subject, 
not sure if she really wanted to hear the evil Willow rant again.

        Tara smiled, &quot;Of course.&quot; She hesitated, looking over at Faith 
as she asked, &quot;Are you going to be stopping in tonight?&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Faith said casually.

        Even Tara seemed a bit surprised as she said, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

        Faith walked beside her a moment, watching Tara as she took in 
Willow, Buffy and Dawn talking together, Giles keeping an eye on them 
all. &quot;Maybe you&#39;ll let me buy you a drink or something,&quot; Faith offered, 
&quot;you have to go on break sometime.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; was Tara&#39;s noncommittal answer.

        Faith clearly wanted to ask for more, but decided not to push. 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; was all she said, noting Giles was waving to her. She sighed, 
&quot;Duty calls.&quot;

        &quot;Have fun,&quot; Tara smiled wryly.

        Faith walked over to Giles and sighed, &quot;Your timing sucks, G.&quot;

        &quot;Huh?&quot; Giles looked confused.

        &quot;Never mind,&quot; Faith shook her head, &quot;what&#39;s up?&quot;

        &quot;The vampires went after us in a coordinated way tonight,&quot; Giles 
said seriously, &quot;I fear that someone may be leading the vampires of 
Sunnydale again.&quot;

        Faith looked at him thoughtfully, &quot;We don&#39;t know for sure, of 
course. Do you have any idea of who might be leading them, assuming it&#39;s 
true?&quot;

        &quot;The Master sired many powerful vampires,&quot; Giles sighed, &quot;and 
there are other old vampires out there, it could be anyone.&quot;

        &quot;Lovely,&quot; Faith sighed.</pre>
