Raven dodged the rocks that were hurled her way, and lifted her arms to 
create a black semi-transparent shield. A large boulder smashed into her 
shield and forced her boots to skid a few meters back, while she let out 
a low grunt. Her frown was evident as she stared to the blonde elemental 
before her, the look in her eyes sending chills down the young 
sorceress&#39; mind. Slade stood confidently by his chair, next to the 
monitoring system he had used to initiate Raven&#39;s earlier attempts of 
infiltrating his base undetected. Terra held an emotionless gaze as 
Slade continued to punch in commands into the controlling device on his 
wrist, and forced her to continue her assault on the dark magus.
 
&quot;Terra, stop it,&quot; Raven ordered the girl. The blonde replied with 
another wave of her hands which caved in a portion of the ceiling just 
above the dark haired Titan. Raven leaped to the side and flew out of 
the way, while rocks tore through portions of her cloak. It was obvious 
from her looks that the girl had done battle with Slade before he had 
placed the device on her body. Blood had crusted to her lip and chin 
while bruises showered her face. Even still, it seemed the girl held no 
care to her injuries, and continued to attack the girl ruthlessly.
 
Raven&#39;s palm touched the surface of the flooring, while her eyes shifted 
from the blonde to the mercenary. She took the gamble with Terra pretty 
far away, and hurled herself forward. She flew with great speed toward 
Slade, her right fist cocking back and fusing with her own dark 
elemental powers. Just before she was to strike, Slade lifted his wrist 
and pressed a button, which hurled a large piece of rock from Raven&#39;s 
side right into her body. The sorceress was thrown to the side like a 
rag doll, tumbled to the ground, and skidded to a stop near the wall of 
the cave. Terra stood upon a floating rock and levitated next to her 
leader with her arms down by her side. Raven slowly pushed herself from 
the ground and let out a grunt of frustration. Her fists clenched 
tightly while her knees were scrapped along the rocks she fell upon.
 
&quot;So you decided to come all by yourself?&quot; Slade asked in an amused tone, 
while the semi-conscious Terra took a few steps toward Raven. He took a 
look toward his screen monitors to assure there were no intruders, then 
turned to the girl in question. &quot;What was it you were hoping to 
accomplish alone?&quot;
 
Raven spat a collected amount of saliva to the ground and wiped it off 
with her wrist. She knew exactly what Slade was trying to do, and she 
had driven blindly right into his expectations. He knew of the closeness 
between Terra and herself, and there was nothing stopping him from using 
it against her. How could she fight back? How could Raven fight against 
the one girl she had truly opened up to? Raven&#39;s lips flat-lined, as the 
only available option became clear in her mind. Despite her aches and 
pains, Raven pushed herself to a sitting position and slowly pulled her 
legs into a meditative stance. Slade instantly recognized it, and 
ordered Terra to attack.
 
&quot;Tara, stop her now!&quot; he exclaimed. The girl&#39;s pupil-less eyes lowered 
and sprinted forward, while her hands shimmered a golden-yellow hue. A 
black aura erupted around the sorceress, while just ten meters remained 
in distance, Raven&#39;s soul-self emerged from her chest. The black 
semi-transparent version of Raven flew forward, and stopped Terra just 
three meters from the oncoming attack. The blonde tumbled lifelessly to 
the ground, while Slade quickly rushed forward.

&quot;Terra?&quot;
 
&quot;Raven! Is that you? Please, I can&#39;t control anything!&quot;
 
&quot;Terra, you have to calm down...&quot;
 
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean for this to happen, Raven, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;
 
&quot;Terra, please, listen to me...&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Raven, please! I can&#39;t stop this, no matter how hard I try!&quot;
 
&quot;Terra! You have to calm your emotions down, or you&#39;ll never-&quot;
 
&quot;Please, Raven! I don&#39;t want to fight anymore! It hurts too much, I just 
can&#39;t take it!&quot;
 
&quot;Terra!&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry ... I&#39;m so ... so sorry ... I just ... I just can&#39;t fight it 
anymore ... I just want this all to end.&quot;
 
&quot;Just listen to me for a second!&quot;
 
&quot;....&quot;
 
&quot;Your emotions aren&#39;t balanced, you&#39;re powers are growing beyond your 
control by the second. If you don&#39;t get a hold on your emotions, it will 
destroy you, and everyone around you!&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean-&quot;
 
&quot;Stop apologizing already! I know you&#39;re sorry, but you apologizing wont 
change anything that&#39;s happened.&quot;
 
&quot;I ...&quot;
 
&quot;However, taking affirmative action could change what will happen.&quot;
 
&quot;...&quot;
 
&quot;Get a hold of yourself. Calm your emotions. Take control of them. Take 
control of your powers. Only you can do this, Terra, I can only show you 
the way. You&#39;re the one that&#39;s going to have to take control. You&#39;re the 
only one that can choose the path you take, no one else. Do you remember 
the conversation we had that night? About sins being forgiven?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes...&quot;
 
&quot;I know now what you were speaking of, Terra, and my answer still 
remains the same. Once someone knows of the mistakes they&#39;ve made, they 
are forgiven only if they accept the responsibility of what they&#39;ve 
done, and take affirmative action to correct what has been done. You&#39;re 
the-&quot;

Slade gripped his staff and slammed it against the left side of Raven&#39;s 
ribcage. The sorceress let out a scream as her soul self was violently 
ripped out, and fused back into its owner. Raven began to push her body 
up from the dirt, but was stopped at the neck by the tip of Slade&#39;s 
staff. The mercenary pushed the metal into the girl&#39;s neck, and forced 
her head into the dirt. With his boot, he kicked the same side, this 
time hitting her right arm, hard enough to send her onto her back. His 
foot was then planted onto her chest, and he calmly brought his staff 
back behind him, tapping an end against the side of his head.
 
&quot;Now, now, you know it&#39;s rude to leave the host out of the 
conversation,&quot; Slade glared to the girl as he spoke with a low tone.
 
&quot;Sorry, it sickens me just to be in the same area with diabolical 
creature such as yourself. You aren&#39;t even human,&quot; Raven panted heavily 
while attempting to lessen the weight of Slade&#39;s boot with her good arm. 
Slade&#39;s last kick seemed to either dislocate or break her arm. Her head 
was so full of lead, she couldn&#39;t concentrate on pain at the moment. 
&quot;Taking over someone&#39;s mind? Forcing someone to use powers they can&#39;t 
control, against their will?&quot;
 
&quot;You speak as if the girl didn&#39;t come to me, seeking my help,&quot; Slade 
reminded the girl as he leaned forward, resting an arm over his knee. 
His one eye glared through the mask and right in the center of Raven&#39;s 
eyes, knowing she could not only see the smirk he held but sense it as 
well. &quot;She rejected you, and begged for me. And now, I&#39;ve given her 
everything you couldn&#39;t. Control, and power.&quot;
 
&quot;Yea,&quot; Raven spat out in disgust. &quot;Your control over her power.&quot;
 
&quot;I never stated who I would give it to, just that it would be obtained,&quot; 
Slade smirked as his staff retracted. His hand reached to his utility 
belt and replaced it with another item. &quot;And your powers are quite 
unique as well, Sorceress.&quot;
 
&quot;You couldn&#39;t even dream of attempting to control them,&quot; Raven let out a 
grunt while she gave a quick push to the weight in order to catch her 
breath. It was soon forced out, however, as Slade pushed more heavily on 
her chest.
 
&quot;You have no idea of the knowledge I hold, nor the training I&#39;ve 
endured,&quot; Slade frowned heavily, while a tint of calmly rage entered his 
throat for the first time during their encounter. &quot;And with this little 
device, you&#39;ll be doing all the enduring for me.&quot;
 
Raven&#39;s eyes widened as she felt a sharp pin puncture through her neck. 
She felt the cold liquid quickly enter her blood stream, and not a 
moment later, her entire body felt like dead weight. Her immune system 
immediately attempted to fight against the drug, while her eyes tried 
desperately to remain open.
 
&quot;Telekinesis is quite the power,&quot; Slade stated as he lifted his boot 
from the girl&#39;s chest. Her body was completely immobilized, and her 
breathing had become rhythmic. &quot;It will be a nice addition to my new 
found powers.&quot;
 
&quot;Don&#39;t hurt her...&quot;
 
Slade looked up in surprise and turned to the barely audible voice. The 
blonde haired teen still held an emotionless gaze and a robotic stance. 
However, her dark sapphire hues had begun to shimmer, as if attempting 
to fight back tears. Slade&#39;s eyes glared as he slowly stood and began to 
walk toward the girl.
 
&quot;Are you still awake, my child?&quot; Slade asked curiously with a tilt of 
his head and a smirk behind his mask. &quot;Do we need another injection?&quot;
 
&quot;You ... won&#39;t ... touch her!&quot;
 
Slade&#39;s eyebrow raised to the voice behind him, and turned to face the 
telepath. She was leaned over on her side with her weight shifted onto 
her arms, glaring daggers straight through the mercenary&#39;s mask. Four 
crimson hues had erupted to life while her breathing became deep and 
heavy. Beads of sweat formed upon her forehead as she attempted to keep 
herself conscious, and fought against the urge to sleep. Though the drug 
may have worked on any normal Meta-Human, Raven was far from normal.
 
&quot;You surprise me, my little black bird,&quot; Slade grinned as he altered his 
course back to the dark mage. &quot;That should have been enough to knock you 
out for at least four hours.&quot;
 
Raven&#39;s body began to shake uncontrollably while gripping the ground 
with her fingertips. Slade merely smirked as he approached the girl with 
his hands clasped behind his back.
 
&quot;But then again, I suppose you are far different others,&quot; Slade assumed 
as he brought a hand to his chin. &quot;Perhaps I should have begun with you, 
instead of Robin.&quot;
 
Her four crimson hues shut tightly, as she called upon the last of her 
powers. A small black energy lifted off her form like smoke. Her energy 
expelled outward, as the sorceress sacrificed all remaining emotions 
inside of her. They were put to sleep while her rage awoke physically 
for the first time in as long as she could remember. The sorceress 
slowly rose, as the black energy fell off her form like liquid and 
turned the torn remains of her dark blue cloak to a blood red color. Her 
fists balled up tightly and a low growl escaped her throat. The 
mercenary blinked seeming intrigued by the dark mage&#39;s sudden change.
 
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Slade stated honestly, as he crouched down into a 
fighting stance. &quot;It&#39;s obvious you are anything but the average super 
hero.&quot;
 
The shadows around the room began to spiral around her form, forcing the 
light in that area to completely fade. The mercenary was now faced with 
an opponent he could not see. As the darkness in the room began to creep 
closer and closer toward him, his body began to crouch. Just as a pair 
of black psychic arms reached out from underneath Slade&#39;s feet, the man 
leaped into the air. From the darkness, the sorceress of shadows leaped 
with her left arm cocked back and screamed in rage. As she threw her 
hand outward, Slade grasped the girl&#39;s wrist with ease and hurled her 
back toward the ground. The sorceress forced a wave of energy to form 
around her, which stopped her just before crashing into the ground.
 
&quot;Your attacks are pathetic,&quot; Slade frowned as stood up from where he had 
landed. &quot;Even for you, that drug is enough to weaken your body. I can 
only imagine how much energy you have to spend just to stay conscious.&quot;
 
Her jaw was clenched tightly shut as she tried desperately to keep 
herself from passing out. She focused upon the blurry disfigured figures 
heading toward her. She couldn&#39;t count how many there were, but she knew 
there were at least three solid ones, and a few blurry ones.
 
&#39;Please, Terra. Wake up ...&#39;
 
&quot;Az&#39;rath ...&quot; Raven let out a breath as she began to raise her right 
arm. The remains of her energy emitted from her hand while she stretched 
it forward. &quot;M-Metrion...&quot;
 
Slade&#39;s heavy boot came down hard on the girl&#39;s wrist, and forced the 
black energy that had formed to diminish instantly. Raven let out a mute 
cry and fell forward onto the ground. Her entire body felt stiff and 
unable to respond to her request. Slade held a quite but enraged aura 
around him as he leaned his weight onto the sorceress once again. He 
began to lean toward her head, once again moving close enough to whisper 
something torturous.
 
&quot;Get off her now!&quot;
 
Before Slade could even turn toward the source of the voice, a large 
boulder smashed into him from the side. The large rock sandwiched him 
into the far side of the cavern wall. A dark shadow made its way over 
the dark sorceress, with small pebbles falling from the structure in 
which floated by. Her tired eyes looked up to see blonde mane swaying 
behind cloth and metal, with spark coursing around the slim figure.
 
&quot;You may have controlled me,&quot; Terra shouted as she extended an arm in 
defense. Her fingers were burned and scarred, with parts of the 
electronic contraption Slade had placed upon her body pulled apart and 
sticking out of her skin. Blood dripped down her right arm from her 
shoulder, where most of the self-caused damage was made. Her eyes were 
completely taken over by the same golden-yellow energy that swirled 
around her body. &quot;But there&#39;s no way in Hell I&#39;ll allow you to do the 
same to her!&quot;
 
The rock implanted on the opposing side of the cavern fell, with Slade 
landing in a crouched position. The black suit worn around him had been 
torn and tattered, but the man still stood confident as he began to make 
his way toward the two.
 
&quot;As I have told you, my Apprentice,&quot; Slade stated as he lifted one arm 
while reaching to it with the other. &quot;You no longer have a choice in the 
matter.&quot;
 
The sparks around Terra&#39;s body began to surge even more, coursing 
through her with voices and demands attempting to conquer. Her jaw 
clenched tightly shut, as she reached for the two metallic pieces 
impaled into her skull. She gripped them as tightly as she could, 
ignoring every command Slade&#39;s device implanted within her brain.
 
&quot;You can&#39;t control me anymore!&quot; Terra&#39;s scream coated over any and every 
other command within her mind as her eyes closed tightly shut. The pain 
was just another sin to her, and she felt it was far passed time to pay 
for them. With a final heave, the two metal plates shifted outward, not 
entirely from her skull, but enough to rid the pulses conducting into 
her head. In an instant, the voices were gone, and the electric current 
that flowed through her body was gone. However, a new flow entered into 
her body, pure rage. The device on Slade&#39;s wrist began to spark and 
finally exploded while Terra commanded the rock she stood upon directly 
toward the mercenary.
 
&quot;Raven!&quot;
 
The sorceress lost the vision of the fight, and attempted to turn her 
half-opened eyes toward the source of the familiar voice. A green-gloved 
hand lifted the back of her head up carefully, while another parted the 
strands of hair that blocked her field of view.
 
&quot;Ro ... bin ...&quot;
 
She couldn&#39;t even hear her own voice as her body suddenly went limp. 
Robin held a raged expression as he looked up from Raven&#39;s broken figure 
to Slade and Terra battling it out.
 
&quot;Cyborg,&quot; Robin ordered as the rest of his team followed in behind him. 
&quot;Try and figure out what&#39;s wrong with Raven.&quot;
 
The half-metal Titan rushed to the girl&#39;s aid with Beast Boy next to 
him, while Robin and Starfire made their way into the heated battle. The 
green-skinned changeling looked on with worry, having never seen any of 
his teammates in this bad of shape.
 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with her?&quot; Beast Boy asked, noticing her eyes were fully 
open, though unable to focus upon anything.
 
&quot;Her body&#39;s paralyzed,&quot; Cyborg stated as he began a full body scan with 
his hi-tech arm. &quot;She&#39;s fighting to stay conscious.&quot;
 
Terra screamed in rage as she hurled boulder after boulder at Slade. The 
suited mercenary dodged each one, leaping higher and higher throughout 
the cavern walls. With a throw of her hands, Terra ordered the rock 
Slade stood upon to crumble, forcing the man to free fall toward the 
ground. With a quick twist of his waist, Slade landed roughly on the 
ground. He then quickly leaped out of the way just as a portion of the 
ceiling caved in where he had landed.
 
&quot;Terra! Stop!&quot; Robin shouted with an outstretched arm. The battle moved 
throughout the battlefield faster than he could keep up. The Earth 
Elemental&#39;s powers were growing far too powerful for the cave structure 
to hold. Terra&#39;s eyes were completely taken over by a powerful golden 
yellow hue and her assault never halted at Robin&#39;s command. As Slade 
charged for the girl, Terra brought her hands out to the side. Letting 
out a low grunt, the Earth Elemental closed her fingers and ripped out 
two large boulders from the sidewalls. With a clap of her hands, she 
forced the boulders to smash together. Slade leaped up and avoiding 
being flattened by a fraction of a second. He retrieved his metal staff, 
extended it, and swung it back in preparation to take the girl&#39;s head 
right off. With a quick lift of her hands, however, Terra brought up a 
rock shield in front of her. Slade smashed right through it with his 
staff.
 
&quot;HA!&quot; Terra screamed out as her boot made contact with the side of 
Slade&#39;s head, completely catching the mercenary off guard by changing 
her tactics to melee fighting. She leaped into the air, spun around, and 
delivered a roundhouse with the same leg right into the man&#39;s ribcage. 
The mercenary lowered his arm and grabbed hold of Terra&#39;s leg, despite 
her attack, and extended his own leg outward to the side of her own 
head. Terra&#39;s head whipped to the side, fully unwary of the opposing 
hook punch Slade held ready for her. He then followed with an upper cut 
and a leaping sidekick that sent the girl flying into Starfire&#39;s arms.
 
&quot;Terra!&quot; Starfire cried out to the girl. Her body tensed for a moment as 
she collected the blood in her mouth and spit it out. The Tamaranian 
helped the girl to stand while Robin hastily ran past them, immediately 
falling into hand-to-hand combat with Slade. No words were even passed 
as Robin allowed his emotions to take over in his logical thought 
process fully. The mercenary blocked each arm strike and kick the boy 
wonder had to offer. With a swing of Slade&#39;s staff, Robin back-flipped, 
retracted his own from his utility belt, and extended it outward just in 
time to parry the man&#39;s next attack.
 
&quot;What are you all doing here?&quot; Terra asked as the battle she had fought 
began to take its toll on her body. With an arm slung over Starfire&#39;s 
shoulder, she watched as Robin and Slade continued to exchange blow 
after blow.
 
&quot;We have come for you,&quot; Starfire stated truthfully. Terra&#39;s eyes shifted 
downward and let out a disgusted breath in reply.
 
&quot;I didn&#39;t ask to be rescued,&quot; Terra said without looking up to the girl. 
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have come.&quot;
 
&quot;But Terra,&quot; Starfire started, but Terra quickly stopped her in 
mid-sentence.
 
&quot;This is my fight, Star,&quot; Terra interrupted the scarlet haired girl. 
&quot;None of you should be here.&quot;
 
&quot;We have been battling Slade long before we have come to know you,&quot; 
Starfire was equally quick with her own statement. &quot;This fight is not 
yours alone.&quot;
 
&quot;You don&#39;t understand,&quot; Terra said as she forced herself to stand on her 
own. She shrugged off Starfire&#39;s attempt to aid, and watched the battle 
between Robin and Slade. &quot;I don&#39;t want to send Slade to prison.&quot;
 
&quot;I do not understand,&quot; Starfire&#39;s brows pinched inward in confusion. 
&quot;You do not wish for Slade to pay for what he has done?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m going to send him straight to Hell,&quot; Terra&#39;s tone had become much 
lower. Her fingers clenched tightly against her palm as she formed two 
balled up fists. &quot;I want both of us to pay for what we&#39;ve done.&quot;
 
Before Starfire could comment, the rock below Terra&#39;s feet lifted and 
she hurled herself forward to rejoin the battle. The sound of metal 
smacking against metal echoed throughout the cavern. Robin and Slade&#39;s 
moves were almost identical to one another, appearing as if they held 
the same Master at one time. Robin leaped over Slade&#39;s kick, and came 
hammering down with the heel of his boot. With his staff raised, Slade 
blocked the teen&#39;s kick, reached for his leg, and pulled him into a 
punch. The two staves dropped to the ground simultaneously.
 
&quot;You&#39;re interrupting a personal matter, boy,&quot; Slade stated as he parried 
Robin&#39;s right hook.
 
&quot;You&#39;re going to jail once and for all,&quot; Robin replied as he blocked 
Slade&#39;s kick with both his arms.
 
&quot;You really think prison bars can hold me?&quot; Slade laughed as he blocked 
another punch and grasped tightly onto his wrist. &quot;There&#39;s no way in 
Hell I&#39;d allow a failed apprentice like you to bring me in.&quot;
 
&quot;Then allow me to drag you down,&quot; came a shout from behind the boy 
wonder. Robin quickly delivered a kick to Slade&#39;s midsection in order to 
break the hold. He then back flipped out of the way, just as Terra came 
rushing forward on her floating rock. The blonde haired girl leaped off 
the rock and extended her leg outward for a kick. Slade was ready 
though, grabbed the girl with ease, and spun to smash her back first 
into the ground. Her eyes were still glowing immensely as the rock she 
had leaped off smashed into Slade&#39;s back, which he had failed to prepare 
for. Terra&#39;s knees instantly rose into his chest, and with a push of her 
hands, she flung the mercenary back to reverse the pin. Before he had 
even hit the ground, Terra had begun to pummel his fast with her fists.
 
&quot;It&#39;s all your fault, you bastard!&quot; Terra screamed as she pounded her 
fist into his mask. It cracked further and further with every punch she 
delivered, and the mercenary had been too stunned to put up a quick 
enough defense. It only took him a short moment to recover, but Terra 
had already landed eight to ten punches. The split in his mask cracked 
fully, and Terra hesitated as the mercenary&#39;s true face was revealed.
 
&quot;Once again, you&#39;ve neglected your training,&quot; Slade&#39;s voice was sinister 
as his hand reached up to grab hold of Terra&#39;s entire face. With a turn 
of his body, he slammed her head first into a boulder, smashing it to 
pieces. &quot;Never hesitate.&quot;
 
As Slade cocked his hand back to deliver the punch, Terra&#39;s aura 
exploded. Her screams were deafened by the violent shaking of rock and 
Earth around her. Slade&#39;s balance on the girl was shaken, as the entire 
rock structure they sat on began to tremble immensely. A ring of yellow 
collapsed all rock flooring around them, revealing an endless pit below. 
Terra&#39;s pure aura was enough to throw Slade off her as she began to 
float upward. Her eyes were fused with the golden-yellow hue of the 
energy spiraling around her, and her merciless look sent chills for the 
first time down the mercenary&#39;s spine. Her hands slowly rose upward, as 
yellow energy cracked throughout the ground around them.
 
&quot;Die!&quot; Terra screamed as the entire ground crumbled. With an inability 
to fight against gravity, Slade began to free fall to the pit below, 
where a smoldering hot death awaited him. The cavern around them 
continued to shake even after Terra&#39;s aura began to diminish. As soon as 
her energy was depleted, Terra expected her fate to be no different, and 
fell back first into the lava pit below. Her eyes were closed tightly, 
fearing the end of her life. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Raven ... I so sorry.&quot;
 
&quot;You must apologize in person,&quot; a voice called out as she felt her wrist 
grabbed just as the heat began to warm her back. Terra opened her 
tearful gaze up to the Princess of Tamaran in pure shock. Starfire began 
to slow her accent as she pulled Terra up to grab her other arm. Though 
hesitant at first, Terra reached up and grasped onto Starfire hand as 
she pulled them both up toward safety. Robin stood at the edge with 
Beast Boy and Cyborg holding Raven in his arms behind them. Starfire 
landed with the girl in the center of the group, while the ceiling began 
to cave downward. Terra&#39;s eyes were right away on Raven&#39;s out stretched 
body lying motionlessly in Cyborg&#39;s arms.
 
&quot;The entire structure&#39;s collapsing,&quot; Robin announced to the team.
 
&quot;We&#39;ve got a bigger problem,&quot; Cyborg stated as he nodded his head to the 
side paneling on his left arm. &quot;Terra&#39;s powers activated a dormant 
volcano that&#39;s big enough to take out the entire city.&quot;
 
&quot;Can we stop it?&quot; Beast Boy asked hastily.
 
&quot;There&#39;s not enough time,&quot; Cyborg stated. &quot;This whole place is gonna go 
down in less than two minutes.&quot;
 
&quot;We&#39;ve got to get out of here,&quot; Robin ordered as he began to make his 
way toward the entrance. &quot;There&#39;s nothing we can do from here, let&#39;s 
go!&quot;
 
It was then that Terra saw Raven&#39;s eyes move toward her. They met for 
only a faction of a second before Terra turned away, unable to look the 
girl in the eye. Robin and Starfire were first in line to the exit, with 
Cyborg following in tow. Raven fought to keep up the view of the girl 
with her head hanging off Cyborg&#39;s mechanical bicep, but her vision was 
blocked by Beast Boy. The changeling stood with Terra, placing a steady 
hand on her shoulder.
 
&quot;Come on, Terra,&quot; he said to the girl that refused to look up from the 
ground. &quot;We gotta get out of here.&quot;
 
&quot;You have to get out of here,&quot; Terra said as she turned back to the 
large hole she had created. &quot;I have to stay.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot; Beast Boy asked. &quot;No, you can&#39;t. Robin said it&#39;s too late.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s never too late,&quot; Terra said with a sad smile as she turned back to 
him. Beast Boy&#39;s vision became misty as he fought desperately to keep 
the tears from falling.
 
&quot;Terra,&quot; Beast Boy&#39;s voice had dropped to barely audible. &quot;No...&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Beast Boy,&quot; Terra said in a low voice. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for 
everything I&#39;ve done.&quot;
 
Beast Boy held no words for the girl as countless emotions mirrored her 
fa&#135;ade. She spared a glance back to Cyborg who had turned to wait for 
the two and was shouting for them to hurry up. She locked her eyes upon 
the side of Raven&#39;s head, which was unable to focus on her. Terra 
preferred it that way; she couldn&#39;t bear to look the girl in the eyes 
after what she had done to her.
 
&quot;Take care of Raven, B.B.,&quot; Terra said as she pulled the teen into a 
hug. Though baffled at first, Beast Boy returned the hug, not wanting to 
let go. &quot;I know I&#39;ve hurt all of you, but I know I hurt her the most. 
Please, promise me you&#39;ll watch over her.&quot;
 
&quot;I promise,&quot; Beast Boy replied with tightly closed eyes. Terra was the 
first to release her grip, and as soon as he felt her arms drop, beast 
Boy did the same, despite the thoughts in his mind to drag the girl with 
him. Again, the blonde haired girl held the sad smile as she brushed her 
hair behind her ear.
 
&quot;You&#39;re a good person, Beast Boy, and a great friend,&quot; Terra stated 
firmly. &quot;And I know I can never be forgiven for what I&#39;ve done.&quot;
 
&quot;I forgive you,&quot; Beast Boy shouted in an instant. Terra was taken back 
at first, but smiled once again as she lowered her view.
 
&quot;I know how you feel about me, B,&quot; Terra said truthfully. &quot;And I&#39;m sorry 
for all the things I&#39;ve put you through. Now, get out of here.&quot;
 
Before he could say anything further, Terra ordered the rock Beast Boy 
stood on back toward the entrance of the cave. Her eyes never left until 
she saw his retreating back, and she breathed out a sigh.
 
&#39;Terra...&#39;
 
The blonde didn&#39;t have to register a thought to know whose voice had 
interrupted her thoughts. She smiled, knowing Raven wouldn&#39;t allow her 
to end it without expressing her final thoughts.
 
&#39;Terra, please don&#39;t do this.&#39;
 
&quot;I have to, Raven,&quot; Terra explained. &quot;I&#39;m the only one who can stop this 
from happening.&quot;
 
&#39;I don&#39;t want you to do this. Please, Terra, it can&#39;t end this way.&#39;
 
Terra was surprised at the emotion the stoic sorceress seemed to give 
through her telepathy. Even still, Terra was determined.
 
&quot;Then don&#39;t think of this as an end,&quot; Terra said as she began to use her 
powers to levitate the rock toward the center of the large crater where 
lava began to build. With determination in her eyes, her ruined clothing 
hanging in shreds from beneath the steal plates, her expression showed 
that for her, at that very moment, nothing else existed in her world 
except for the task of keeping the volcano from erupting. Every part of 
her body began to glow yellow, as the sea of boiling liquid raged all 
around her. Her head bowed and her eyes shut tightly while her blonde 
mane rose all around her.
 
She stood in her motionless battle against the impending destruction, 
while a column of light shot upward from her body. Finally, she brought 
her fists up from her side and clenched her teeth soundlessly for the 
biggest effort of her life. She cried out one final scream, as the 
energy and lave surged everywhere, and in a blinding white flash, all 
went silent. Only the last stray thought traveled to the dark mage&#39;s 
mind.
 
&#39;Think of this as a new beginning.&#39;
