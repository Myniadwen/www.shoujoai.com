Somehow Sandi and Daria had found the ship of good fortune, for they had 
both reached home just in time, thus staying in their mothers&#39; good 
graces. Right now, Daria was in the bathroom washing off her smeared 
lipstick along with her face while Jane wrung a wet towel over her head.

&quot;You OK?&quot; said the artist.

&quot;Couldn&#39;t be better,&quot; replied the auburn. &quot;But next time you&#39;ve got to 
teach me how to run--I think my boots need a 70,000 mile rotation.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a miracle you didn&#39;t fall off that clock tower--even after those 
bells rang your chimes. You know it&#39;s hard to believe that after all 
that useless chasing all over Lawndale, all Sandi wanted to do was just 
talk with you over that kiss. Not only that, she said she was a 
lesbian?&quot;

&quot;Yup. Worse still, she proved to me that she was in love with me.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?!!?&quot; Jane&#39;s cobalt blue eyes bugged out.

&quot;She said she loved me, because I was her first kiss. She was torn 
between me and Quinn--till that kiss changed everything.&quot;

&quot;Now I&#39;ve seen everything--ol&#39; S. G.&#39;s got it bad, which proves Football 
Brain and Eep Eep The Road Runner were evesdropping.&quot;

&quot;I got a feeling,&quot; said Daria, who had dried her hair, &quot;we&#39;re in for 
some strange days.&quot;

&quot;Boy, we&#39;re sure thankful that Sandi&#39;s not in our class,&quot; said Jane. 
&quot;since she&#39;s a year below me and you. Can you imagine if she was in the 
same year as you, and in our class--and worst of all, with a crush on 
you? She would been behind you blowing kisses, gushing and making goo 
goo eyes at you? Not to mention stick love notes in your locker.&quot;

Grinning her Mona Lisa grin, Daria said, &quot;Griffin Girl Goes Gaga For 
Geeky Girl, coming up next on Sick Sad World.&quot;

&quot;EW!!!!&quot; said Quinn, who had just stepped in the bathroom. &quot;That is even 
worse than that half baked story Brittany and Kevin told me, Stacy and 
Tiffany!!&quot;

&quot;They told you that?&quot; said the auburn.

&quot;Right after you and Sandi hightailed it from The Pizza Prince--uh, I 
mean, King,&quot; replied the redhead.

&quot;Did she make it back home?&quot; 

&quot;From what she told me on the phone, she made it just in time. She said 
that all she wanted to do was just talk over that kiss you two did, all 
just to win a bet.....by the way, you two DID talk and not fight?&quot; 
Quinn&#39;s eyebrows had just narrowed.

&quot;Absolutely,&quot; said Daria. &quot;Do pigs fly?&quot; 

&quot;EW!!&quot; gasped the redhead. &quot;Pigs flying?!? Anyhow, Daria, Sandi just 
called an emergency meeting here, so--&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t fail you, Captain Kirk,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;Me and Jane will 
stay out of your bouncy hair.&quot;

But Sandi&#39;s bunch wasn&#39;t the only thing showing up that night at the 
Morgendorffer home, for Trent, Jesse, Nick, Max, Monique and Tom came 
by, and--to the surprise of Jake and Helen--took out all the padded 
walls and wall mounted rails. Then Jane stuck on the walls and ceiling, 
the glow in the dark stars, while Tom gave Daria, a fluorescent black 
light to make the stars glow. When that job was finished, Jane said, 
&quot;Our finest hour is at hand, so prepare to be stupid--uh, I mean 
stupified.&quot;

Entering the room, Helen said in amazement, &quot;Well, that is history!! 
Daria, what made you, after so many years, finally get rid of that 
padded walling?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just say Jane gave me the idea,&quot; said the auburn. 

&quot;Well, let&#39;s see the new miracle,&quot; said Jake. Then he got flustered 
with, &quot;Where&#39;s my camcorder?!?&quot;

&quot;Ok, group,&quot; said Jane. &quot;let&#39;s blast off on the space shuttle 
Enterprise.&quot;

&quot;Go for it, Janey,&quot; said Trent.

So the artist turned off the lights just as Daria turned on the black 
light lamp for a few seconds, then turned that off--

--and instantly Daria&#39;s room was transformed into a vast galaxy of 
glowing stars and planets, all over the walls and the ceiling, where, in 
the center, was the centerpiece: an intricate chartlike map of the solar 
system of the planets, moons, planetary symbols and the orbit 
trajectories. For Jane Lane, it was her greatest endevor, and it came up 
trumps.

&quot;Incredible.....!!&quot; said Helen.

&quot;Fascinating.....!!&quot; said Jake.

&quot;It&#39;s your greatest triumph, Janey,&quot; said Trent.

&quot;Cool,&quot; said Jesse.

&quot;Fantastic,&quot; said Nick.

&quot;Beam me up, Scotty,&quot; said Max.

&quot;What a trip,&quot; said Monique.

&quot;You did it, Jane....!!&quot; said Tom.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; said Daria.

&quot;My finest hour indeed,&quot; said Jane.

At that moment, Sandi and her fellow Fashion Clubbers stoliclly entered, 
the brunette stating, &quot;Like, can you stop the noise?!? We&#39;ve got a 
meeting........!!&quot; Upon seeing the stars and planets, she was 
transfixed, along with Quinn, Stacy and Tiffany.

&quot;Breathtaking....!!&quot; said Sandi.

&quot;Did Jane do THAT.......?!?&quot; said Stacy.

&quot;Just like the universe itself....!!&quot; said Tiffany.

&quot;Jane, you outdid yourself!!&quot; said Quinn.

&quot;Can you dig it?&quot; said the artist. &quot;I knew that I could.&quot;

For a moment, the brunette stared at the ceiling map before turning her 
attention back to her fashion freaks and said, &quot;Let&#39;s get it over with.&quot; 
From there, she and her Fashion Clubbers headed out the door.

Unbeknownst to anyone, Daria, while staring at the stars, chanced to 
spot Sandi&#39;s departure, and thought, &quot;Forgive me Tom, 
but........I....think am falling in love with Sandi......and the last 
time I felt like that was with Trent....&quot;

Returning back to Quinn&#39;s room, Sandi and co. settled down before the 
brunette--in the most sober way--said, &quot;Anyhow, I called you here, for 
what could be the most second serious moment........y&#39; see, the time&#39;s 
come for me to do the most unheard of first in The Fashion Club&#39;s 
history.........I am placing myself on a fashion sabbatical, till I can 
get back what I lost--my fashion state of mind.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?!?&quot; said Quinn.

&quot;Brr,&quot; said Tiffany.

&quot;Oh, Sandi, you CAN&#39;T do that!!&quot; wailed Stacy.

&quot;Settle down, I didn&#39;t say I&#39;d part ways with you!! There is no way in 
Hell I can be a president when I couldn&#39;t concentrate on important 
matters. Anyhow, Quinn, I am entrusting you as acting president, till I 
get back. Just don&#39;t lead The Club into a fashion faux pas, OK?&quot;

&quot;If you say so,&quot; said Quinn. &quot;I just wish you were going with me and 
Tiffany to Stacy&#39;s for tomorrow night&#39;s sleepover.&quot;

&quot;Well, the fact my folks will be out of town for two days, and my 
brothers will be at camp, I&#39;ll have all the time to meditate and pick up 
the pieces.&quot;

&quot;I hope you know what you&#39;re doing,&quot; said Tiffany.

&quot;Get well soon, Sandi....,&quot; wept Stacy.

&quot;Staa-cy,&quot; said the testy brunette, &quot;have you no faith in me?!? We&#39;ve 
had a lot of strange days here, and I don&#39;t need strange sobbers like 
you.....&quot;

But even while Sandi was scolding her pigtailed friend, something else 
was on her mind--and that something else was Daria........

Wednesday, the third day of the week. Say no more.

As before, neither Daria, nor Sandi could sleep at all. But now, both 
had come to a conclusion--to take the next step that was within their 
minds and souls.

As strange coincidences went, Helen, before heading off to work, said 
that she and Jake would be out of town for two days, finishing up with, 
&quot;I hope you can be the girl of the house, Daria.&quot;

&quot;Aye aye, Captain Kirk,&quot; said the auburn.

&#39;Captain Kirk?&quot; said Jake in disdain. &quot;I thought Picard made the better 
captain.&quot;

&quot;Da-AD!!&quot; said Quinn. &quot;I thought the gal from Voyager ruled.&quot;

Sighing, Helen said, &quot;Well, I hope you can take care of everything 
here.&quot;

Then upon noticing her eldest daugher&#39;s state of reverie, she asked, 
&quot;Daria? You feeling OK?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just say I couldn&#39;t sleep at all,&quot; was the reply.

&quot;Well, it&#39;ll be quiet tonight, kiddo, with your sister staying with her 
friends and me and your mom on vacation,&quot; said Jake.

&quot;Uh, Jake.......,&quot; said Helen. &quot;you sure Picard makes the better captain 
than Kirk?&quot;

Upon arriving at Lawndale High, Daria pondered over the fact that it 
took her some time to develop a crush for Tom, compared with the near 
thing with Trent and now Sandi. Right now, she was talking with Jane 
down one of the halls.

&quot;Thanks so much for the stars,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;Maybe they&#39;ll settle 
my state of mind back to Grade A status.&quot;

&quot;Much obliged,&quot; said the artist. &quot;But you sure looked like a zombie when 
you saw Sandi head out the door last night.&quot;

&quot;Stop it, Jane. How much you wanna bet ol&#39; S. G.&#39;s forgotten me, and is 
back to her old rotten self?&quot;

&quot;Bet heavily on it.&quot;

Arriving at her locker, Daria opened it up so she could store her back 
pack-- and that was when a greeting card with fancy ornate heart 
patterns tumbled out. On the front, in the most gorgeous lettering font, 
was: SANDI LOVES DARIA.

&quot;You were saying?&quot; said Jane.

&quot;One thing&#39;s for sure,&quot; said Daria. &quot;At least we know she can draw just 
like you.&quot;

&quot;Beam me up, Scotty. There&#39;s no intelligence here.&quot;

It was then that Daria remembered her meeting with Sandi atop the roof 
of the Lawndale High building; knowing the brunette would be expecting 
her, the auburn headed up to the roof before lunchtime, hoping she would 
rejoin her partner in crime at the cafeteria. 

It turned out however, she didn&#39;t need to wait so long, for Sandi came 
up behind her, clasped each hand over Daria&#39;s bespecticled eyes and 
said, &quot;Guess who?&quot;

&quot;Oh, please.....,&quot; muttered the auburn who turned to face the brunette, 
who said, &quot;Like, you&#39;re no fun sometimes!!&quot;

After sharing a deep long kiss, Sandi said, &quot;Hello, precious. Did you 
get the love note I stuck in your locker?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; replied Daria. &quot;and I must say, you draw just as good as Jane.&quot;

&quot;It pays off when such a talent is used for The Fashion Club&#39;s dress 
designs for get togethers and stuff.&quot; Staring deeply in the auburn&#39;s 
eyes, the brunette added, &quot;Daria........do you feel a something you 
can&#39;t explain........something impelling you....to take the next 
step......for the ultimate test of time?&quot;

&quot;Like some kind of bat signal? I feel the same way....and the last times 
I felt like that was first with Trent, and then with Tom.&quot;

&quot;As in Trent Lane, your friend&#39;s brother? That band he is in sounds like 
a Doors cover band.&quot;

&quot;I said the same thing too,&quot; said Daria. &quot;So.........supposing we&#39;re 
ready to take the next step........if we do.......how? And where?&quot;

&quot;I DO know my folks will be out of town,&quot; said Sandi. &quot;Yours too?&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d you guess? S-O---------in that case, I think I MAY know just the 
place.......&quot;

&quot;You do?&quot;

&quot;Just........leave everything to me, and I&#39;ll break out the bat signal.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll call you when it&#39;s all set for tonight.&quot;

&quot;Tonight......,&quot; murmured the brunette. Writing on a piece of paper, she 
handed it to Daria. &quot;Here&#39;s my cell phone number. I&#39;ll be at Cashman&#39;s 
between 3:30 and 4:00, so call me then.&quot;

Then under her breath, she hissed, &quot;DON&#39;T LOSE IT!!&quot;

&quot;All I can say is.......I am going to hate myself in the morning,&quot; said 
the auburn doubtfully.

&quot;Just as long as you don&#39;t try to make a brain out of me,&quot; said the 
brunette.

&quot;Just as long as you don&#39;t make a fashion freak out of me. Let&#39;s get 
back to our respective compadres.&quot;

&quot;Like, so be it.&quot; From there, Sandi and Daria kissed together before 
heading back down the stairs.

For the rest of the day, it was business as usual at Lawndale High. But 
after school was out for the day, Daria hightailed it till she reached 
Dega St--and The Red Barchetta Hotel. As luck would have it, she saw 
Aunt Amy at the registration desk.

&quot;Why hello, Daria,&quot; said Amy. &quot;So what brings you here, besides your 
feet?&quot; 

Looking all around to ensure she wasn&#39;t spotted by anyone she knew, the 
auburn replied discreetly, &quot;I need a room here for tonight.&quot;

Her eyebrows shooting up in surprise, Amy said, &quot;What happened? Did you 
and your family have it out again?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s more than that, and I need a place of peace to 
crash out and get my bearings, just for one night.&quot;

&quot;You DO know it costs $150 per night here.&quot;

Pulling out a fistful of bills, Daria handed them to Amy who said, &quot;Oh, 
right, I hadn&#39;t counted on all that bribe money you collected from your 
mom and sister. Well.........as a favor to my favorite niece, I&#39;ll see 
what I can do. Wait here.&quot;

Turning to a computer terminal, Amy typed several entries then handed 
Daria a form for her to sign in, just like all the hotels. When she had 
finished, the paper was handed back, and Amy inputted that into the 
computer. That done, she said, &quot;OK, you got yourself a room for the 
night,&quot; before handing a plastic keycard to the auburn. &quot;Room 2112, on 
the 21st floor.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Amy.&quot;

&quot;Anything for my favorite niece.&quot;

Soon after that, Daria ran out, across the street, to The Zen and into a 
nearby phone booth. The fact that the clock tower had chimed 3:30 
beforehand was all the auburn needed to know. Using the cell number 
Sandi had gave her, she placed the call.

&quot;Like, who is it?&quot;

&quot;Quinn&#39;s cousin or whatever.&quot;

&quot;Shh!! You&#39;re lucky I was able to break from Quinn and the others and 
hide out in the bathroom here!! So what&#39;s up?&quot;

Looking all around now and then, Daria said, &quot;I got a room for tonight, 
so consider that another triumph for the ship of good fortune.&quot;

&quot;You know, if anyone got wind of what we had in mind, we&#39;d be sooooo in 
trouble......&quot;

&quot;Not only that, we&#39;ll hate ourselves in the morning. But then, it&#39;s no 
worse than athlete&#39;s feet and diaper rash.&quot;

&quot;EW!!&quot; The brunette was a bit testy in her voice. &quot;So, where&#39;ll we 
meet?&quot;

&quot;The Red Barchetta Hotel.&quot;

&quot;The Red Barchetta Hotel.&quot;

&quot;Room 2112.&quot;

&quot;Room 2112.&quot;

&quot;On the 21st floor.&quot;

&quot;On the 21st floor.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting at the elevator there.&quot;

&quot;7:00 tonight?&quot;

&quot;7:00 tonight.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;

After hanging up, Daria took a cab to The Pizza King and met up with 
Jane for their usual quota of pizza slices. For the moment, the furor 
Brittany and Kevin had caused was forgotten. Afterwards, it was back to 
the Morgendorffer house. Helen and Jake had just left, and now Quinn was 
ready to go, waiting for Stacy and Tiffany to pick her up, the former 
having gotten her driver license.

&quot;Just don&#39;t get yourself on a popcorn high tonight,&quot; the auburn said.

&quot;EW!!&quot; was the redhead&#39;s reply.

After Quinn and co. had parted, Daria got her stuff ready in her 
backpack, turned on the house alarm, locked up the place, and headed for 
the hotel.

Once inside, on the 21st floor, in room 2112, which had red, white and 
gold wallpaper, Daria set down her pack and looked out through the 
window which overlooked The Zen down below. Picking up the phone, she 
placed a call to Jane, who said, &quot;Yo.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s me, Jane,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;I&#39;ll be hiding out at the hotel till 
I can get my bearings, so I thought you should know.&quot;

&quot;As in The Red Barchetta Hotel?!? That posh place? How&#39;d you--?&quot;

&quot;It pays to save your bribe money.&quot;

&quot;Oh, right, the ol&#39; legal tender from Quinn and Helen. Well.....take 
care of yourself.&quot;

&quot;Will do.&quot;

After hanging up, Daria tuned into Sick Sad World, which had its share 
of fascinating stories. So far......the fact that she might make love to 
another girl....that WAS a challenge. Which also nearly broke every rule 
in the Daria canon. But it was too late to turn back now. But most 
important, would she succeed with Sandi where she failed with Tom?

Sandi Griffin. Quinn&#39;s best friend. Another girl. And right now, Daria 
wondered what Jane and Alison would think of all that. The time was now, 
for just as Sick Sad World ended, up overhead, the clock chimed 7:00; 
with that in mind, the auburn got up and taking the keycard with her, 
headed down the hall, to the elevator section. &quot;Please, let it be 
Doomsday tonight.....&quot; she muttered.

One second later, one of the elevator doors opened, and Sandi stepped 
out, wearing, of all things, a black and white Blues Brothers type suit, 
black shades and a black porkpie hat. With a slight grin and a nod, she 
followed Daria back to room 2112. 

Entering their room, the auburn quipped, &quot;All hail the runner up from 
The Blues Brothers Look Alike contest.&quot;

&quot;Ha ha, Daria,&quot; said the brunette, taking off her hat and glasses. Then 
upon looking over the nicely decorated interior of room 2112, she added 
in amazement, &quot;Like, HOW were you able to afford a night at a hotel like 
THAT?!? It must cost a fortune for even a brain like you!!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t underestimate The First National Bank Of Daria Morgendorffer.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Bribe money I collected over the years from Quinn and Mom.&quot;

&quot;A shrewd move,&quot; agreed Sandi. &quot;No wonder you never want to get a job.&quot;

&quot;Maybe, maybe not. Just think of it as free enterprise.&quot; Right now, 
Daria had just taken off the sheets off the bed and was setting up her 
portable CD player and its small speakers, while the brunette set down 
the back pack she was carrying before taking off her tie and coat. When 
she had finished, the auburn was standing before her. &quot;You know, I&#39;ll be 
hating myself in the morning,&quot; she said.

&quot;You and me both. But will you still have respect for me? I got an image 
to protect for the honor of The Fashion Club.&quot;

&quot;To quote Pink, let&#39;s get the party started.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a tough nut to crack, Daria Morgendorffer, but I may know a way 
to bring the lovergirl within to the surface.&quot; Reaching out, Sandi 
unzipped Daria&#39;s coat, then her blouse, her boots and socks, her skirt, 
and her white bra and panty. After that, the auburn was naked--which 
beyond any doubt, verified the brunette&#39;s theory that the auburn had a 
beautiful body beneath her clothing.

For Daria&#39;s body had weight in all the right places with flesh that was 
pale white. Her breasts were slightly firm with aureoles larger than a 
silver dollar and nipples the size of ripe strawberries.

&quot;Why, Daria......&quot; said Sandi admiringly. &quot;You&#39;ve got such a BEAUTIFUL 
body.&quot;

&quot;No kiddin&#39;,&quot;

&quot;Now you undress me, lover.....&quot;

Staring up to the ceiling, Daria muttered, &quot;PLEASE, Tom, Jane, 
Quinn.............. forgive me.........I wish Def Leppard were here to 
Armedgeddon it right now....&quot;

Taking a breath, the auburn took off the brunette&#39;s shirt, shoes, socks, 
pants, and her satin coral bra and panty. Indeed, Sandi&#39;s body was just 
as shapely and firm as Daria&#39;s, only a bit slimmer. Her alabaster creamy 
white flesh was a compliment to her breasts which were the same as 
Daria&#39;s, only with smaller aureoles.

&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting, even masturbating for the moment,&quot; said the 
brunette, &quot;when I can make love to you. Don&#39;t tell me brains like you 
don&#39;t play with themselves.&quot;

&quot;Sad to say,&quot; replied the auburn, &quot;we do,&quot; before making her trademark 
smirk.

Sandi could only giggle for a moment before she took Daria by the hand 
and led her to the bed before laying her down on it. Then the brunette 
was lying near her saying, &quot;Oh, Daria............sweet 
Daria..........I&#39;ll give you a night to remember....&quot;

&quot;Whoop de do,&quot; said the auburn.

Without waiting for anything else, Sandi set to the task at hand; first 
she kissed Daria full on the mouth, using a french kiss while she used 
one arm to hold her and one finger to caress, then stick into the 
auburn&#39;s vagina, which caused the cynic to murmur, &quot;Mph!!&quot; But it didn&#39;t 
take long for Daria to respond and kiss back, plunging her tonuge 
alongside Sandi&#39;s, using her left arm to hold the brunette, and use her 
right finger to stick deep in Sandi&#39;s vagina, sliding it in and out fast 
till it was drenched with fluids. Before long, the brunette was on top 
of the auburn, nipples to nipples, breasts to breasts, body to body, and 
mouth to mouth, the two moaning within their kisses, the passion 
building up from their kisses, their bodies and breasts rubbing, and 
their nipples swelling up.

&quot;Mmmmmmmm......mmmmmmmmmmm..........mmmmmm....,&quot; they murmured, before 
Sandi turned over on her back, saying, &quot;Oh, suck my breasts, 
lovergirl.....&quot;

Stoked by the awakened passions, Daria did her part well by lying on top 
of Sandi, sucking the brunette&#39;s thick as an index finger nipples till 
they filled the auburn&#39;s mouth, while using her fingers to finger the 
brunette&#39;s wet as wet vagina till Sandi pitched her head back, gasping, 
&quot;Oh, Daria......!! I never believed.............!! It&#39;s SO 
GOOD............don&#39;t stop, lovergirl!! OHHHHH.....!! &quot;

At first, Daria used her tonuge to make swirling motions before licking 
the hard nipple. Then she kissed it before taking it in, along with all 
the breast, with long deep drinking motions, like a suckling baby.

&quot;Oh.......!!&quot; breathed the brunette. &quot;You act like you&#39;ve done that 
before....&quot;

&quot;Stick around, S. G. ,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;I&#39;ve got surprises up the 
wazoo.&quot;

How right she was, for Daria was now fingering Sandi harder and faster, 
even touching her G spot, till the brunette was writhing all over the 
bed, seeing for the moment, the stars in Daria&#39;s room, on the ceiling, 
twinkling bright, her nipple and breast sucked and licked.&quot;More......in 
your mouth,&quot; she said to the auburn. &quot;Love it when I feed my breast in 
your mouth?&quot;

&quot;Mmmmm-hmmm,&quot; came the reply.

&quot;Love my breast? Mmmmmm, you love it. Do the other one. And finger me 
hard.....!!&quot;

The auburn did just that till her mouth was so full of breast--and that 
was when she stopped and licked the brunette&#39;s vagina clean before 
sticking her tongue way deep in there. In seconds, Sand was again 
writhing, moaning and gasping with pleasure.

&quot;Oh, DAAAAAA-RIIIIAAAAAA!!&quot; screamed the brunette. &quot;It&#39;s SO GOOOOOD!! 
Don&#39;t st----------op!!&quot;

With Sandi in a state of sexual overdrive, Daria complied, working her 
tonuge till it felt like The Fashion Clubber would explode--and that was 
when the said brunette did something which took the auburn by surprise. 
Put simply, she turned Daria over on her back and laid near her, 
murmuring, &quot;Now it&#39;s my turn, sweetie.......&quot; So saying she rubbed the 
auburn&#39;s breasts and nipples, working its magic on a sighing Daria who 
breathed, &quot;So........soft.......so gooooooooood......&quot;

That was when Sandi used her right hand finger to slide in and out from 
Daria&#39;s vagina till it was juicy, while she drooled on the auburn&#39;s 
nipples before licking each one. Then she sweetly kissed them before she 
sucked in deeply the way beyond hard nipple, breast and all. Needless to 
say, the brunette&#39;s efforts worked--for Daria was soon also writhing, 
sighing and gasping, &quot;Sandi...........!!&quot; At one point, the auburn used 
a free hand to reach for the CD player and start it; in a thrice, 
Erasure&#39;s Always was playing: 

Open your eyes I see
your eyes are open
Wear no disguise for me,
come into the open

When it&#39;s cold outside,
am I here in vain?
Hold on to the night;
there will be no shame

Despite her cynical and sarcastic walls of emotion for which she was 
famous for, not even Daria was immune to sexual feelings--feelings which 
were now surging all over her body like a raging typhoon. And now she 
was gasping out, &quot;Ohhhhhhhhh!!!! Happy go lucky me......so 
good.........I love it....!!&quot; 

Always
I wanna be with you,
and make believe with you,
and live in harmony harmony oh love
Always
I wanna be with you,
and make believe with you,
and live in harmony harmony oh love

Always....

Indeed those said emotions and feelings peaked even further when Sandi 
stuck her tonuge and licked, kissed and slid in and out of Daria&#39;s 
vagina till it gushed fluid all over her clit and tongue. so it was no 
wonder the auburn pitched her head back, breathing, 
&quot;D-don&#39;t.....s-stop......!! Sandi.......!!&quot;

Just as the brunette brought her to the absolute peak, Daria called out, 
&quot;Wait, Sandi......!! I got an idea I&#39;d like to try....&quot;

Stopping her tonguing, the brunette asked, &quot;You do?&quot;

&quot;Yup. Just scoot over to the end of the bed and spread your legs, facing 
me.&quot;

After Sandi did just that, she asked, &quot;Now what?&quot;

&quot;Now come close to me facing just like that and lock your legs with 
mine,&quot; replied the auburn.

Sandi came close till her vagina, clitoris and crotch were pressing way 
close against Daria&#39;s, and she locked her legs with the cynic&#39;s, like a 
pair of scissors. Then they were moving, grinding and rubbing their 
vaginas and cilts together, till they were so wet in fluids--not to 
mention building up the pleasure, love and passion in their bodies. 

Melting the ice for me,
jump into the ocean
Hold back the tide I see
your love in motion

When it&#39;s cold outside,
am I here in vain?
Hold on to the night;
there will be no shame

The night went on while Daria and Sandi used what would be known as the 
scissor kick method, (a.k.a. the tribaldiam pose) rubbing their wet with 
vaginal fluids cilt and vaginas, high on emotion with peak level sex 
energy building up in their bodies while they kissed, each girl grabbing 
onto the other&#39;s leg and pulling it to draw the vagina close to trigger 
more pleasure sparks. And right now, the diva and the cynic were making 
breathy squeals.

&quot;Oh, Daria.......!!&quot; breathed the brunette. &quot;It&#39;s so good.......you make 
me feel SO good, lover girl....!! PLEASE, don&#39;t stop......!! Give me 
more.....!! Ahhhhhh!!&quot;

&quot;S-O.......sweet.........!!&quot; gasped the auburn.

Always
I wanna be with you,
and make believe with you,
and live in harmony harmony oh love
Always
I wanna be with you,
and make believe with you,
and live in harmony harmony oh love

Always....

Faster and faster, harder and harder, Sandi and Daria were enjoying 
their sexual high, grinding and rubbing each other&#39;s vaginas, now 
overflowing all over. Salvo after salvo of high powered sexual love and 
passion were surging through like they had never felt before, not in 
their lifetime. For Daria, it was incredible, indeed something she had 
never experienced before, not even with Tom. For Sandi, who had been 
infamous for her haughty and stuck up reputation, she had passions and 
loving emotions she never knew she had before. And she and Daria were 
riding on the crest of a wave of something greater than anything they 
had felt before. And both girls loved it. For that matter, neither girl 
wanted the loving and the passion to stop, knowing well what awaited 
them in the morning. 

When it&#39;s cold outside,
am I here in vain?
Hold on to the night;
there will be no shame

Always
I wanna be with you,
and make believe with you,
and live in harmony harmony oh love
Always
I wanna be with you,
and make believe with you,
and live in harmony harmony oh love

The girls were writhing all over, building up a lot of vaginal fluids, 
when Sandi called out, &quot;Please...........please make me come!! Oh, 
DAAAAAA-RIIIIIAAAA!!!! OHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!&quot;

For all her shaking around, Daria&#39;s glasses didn&#39;t even fall off. Even 
so, she grabbed the brunette&#39;s hand before she wailed, &quot;I........am 
coming!!!!&quot;

&quot;ME TOOOOOOOOOO!!!!&quot; gasped the diva. &quot;DARIA!!!!&quot;

&quot;OH, SANDIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!&quot; Soon after that, the girls pitched their 
heads back before they came with lots of fluid, just as a shockwave of a 
sexual super nova, with the force of the red giant star Antares hit 
them--and hit them hard. The auburn and the brunette grabbed each 
other&#39;s leg before one last gyration and pulled away....before laying 
down on the bed, among the pillows, sharing a big slow deep kiss before 
they broke off, staring in each other&#39;s eyes, panting and sweating.

&quot;Whoo-hoo....,&quot; breathed Sandi.

&quot;Oh boy.......&quot; said Daria. &quot;I just wish......that it would last all 
through the night--because in the morning, I am going to hate myself for 
sure.&quot;

&quot;Me too--but like, what a way to go.....oh, Daria........&quot;

&quot;Oh, Sandi.......oh me....!!&quot;

Getting up on one elbow, Sandi gazed at Daria before saying, &quot;Like, if 
anyone said that geeky unpopular brains like you didn&#39;t make better 
lovers, I&#39;d tell them to go to hell.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a thought,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;And if that doesn&#39;t work, you can 
kick them in the heinie.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you....!!&quot; The brunette giggled before she and the auburn kissed 
together.

Using one hand to turn off the CD player, Daria said, &quot;We&#39;ve got a long 
day ahead, so let&#39;s hit the hay.&quot;

&quot;Absolutely. Good night.........lovergirl....&quot;

&quot;Good night.......Sandi The Griffin.&quot;

From there, the girls shared a kiss before the brunette pulled one of 
the sheets over them, while the auburn took off her glasses, placed them 
on the night stand, and turned off the light.

&quot;I love you, Daria,&quot; sighed Sandi.

&quot;I love you too, Sandi,&quot; murmured Daria, who, realizing what she had 
said, blurted out, &quot;OOP!! Did I say THAT....?&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot; was the reply.

Right now, all the cynic could do was drop off to sleep--but tomorrow 
would be a whole different story. For now, she wanted to sleep, enjoying 
the company--and love--of one Sandi Jillian Griffin.



So it finally happened--Daria and Sandi not only made love, they slept 
together. But what&#39;s going to happen the morning after? Will it be just 
a one night last stand, or will it be a secret affair, unknown to the 
worlds of Daria&#39;s Sick Sad Bunch and Sandi&#39;s Fashionistas? In my 
experience, sex is like candies--they&#39;re not only sweet, you just can&#39;t 
eat just ONE!! I should know, it&#39;s happened to me. So there&#39;s no 
guarantee that another chance to make love ain&#39;t likely to occur again 
Who knows? But then, how long can the love Daria and Sandi share last?
