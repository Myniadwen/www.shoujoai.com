<h1>Itsumo Means Forever (part 4 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/itsumo-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Willow wiped at her eyes tiredly, looking out the window at the clouds 
passing just below them The night flight from Seattle, Washington to LA 
wouldn&#39;t take too long, then a short bus trip would bring her back 
there, back to Sunnydale.

The call from Giles had roused her from a sound sleep, her hand 
searching for the phone. &quot;Yes?&quot; she had managed to ask.

&quot;Willow, it&#39;s Giles,&quot; he had said simply.

She looked at the phone in disbelief. &quot;Giles?&quot; she echoed sleepily, then 
she looked at the clock on her nightstand before squeaking, &quot;It&#39;s 
midnight!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but the Coven has brought something to my attention, 
something we may need your help with,&quot; Giles explained.

&#39;He&#39;s not one to exaggerate,&#39; Willow thought to herself grimly. &quot;What&#39;s 
the situation?&quot; she asked before sitting up in bed and grabbing for her 
scattered clothes.

&quot;There&#39;s been a string of mystical killings,&quot; Giles explained quietly, 
&quot;leading in a line straight towards Sunnydale.&quot;

&quot;Sacrifices?&quot; Willow asked, getting a sinking feeling.

&quot;That&#39;s the strange part,&quot; Giles noted in the eager tones he got when 
confronted by a new mystery, &quot;all those killed were demon kind of some 
sort. Vampires, an incubus, and several other unidentifiable creatures,&quot; 
he explained.

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Willow noted. She sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll be there, hopefully in a 
day or so.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Giles said, and she could hear the relief in his voice. A 
pause, &quot;Kennedy is still out here, along with the others.&quot;

&quot;I figured,&quot; Willow answered him quietly, &quot;but thanks for telling me.&quot; 
They said their farewells, and Willow hung up.

Willow surveyed her rooms, making sure everything was ready for a long 
absence, just in case. She had a suitcase of clothes already packed, in 
case of emergency. Beside it was a smaller case, what she fondly called 
her tool kit, containing a few essential supplies for magic use.

The plane jerked, and Willow was momentarily jerked back to the present. 
A stewardess came by, and Willow gratefully accepted a cup of coffee. 
She rather suspected that she&#39;d be drinking a lot of it over the next 
few days.

&#39;Kennedy,&#39; she thought to herself sadly. She hadn&#39;t been Willow&#39;s only 
reason for finally deciding to leave Sunnydale three years ago, but she 
certainly was one of the major ones. During a night of passion between 
the two of then, Willow had accidentally cried out a name not belonging 
to Kennedy. Tara&#39;s name...

The next morning, Kennedy urged her to stay, but Willow had made up her 
mind. Obviously, Willow wasn&#39;t as over Tara as she thought she was. 
Moreover, she couldn&#39;t let herself keep using Kennedy the way she was. 
So Willow had said her farewells to the Slayer trainees, Xander, Dawn, 
Faith and the others, and sadly took her leave.

During her travels, Willow had discovered her own purpose in the world. 
Even as Angel was a Champion, so was she, just of the mystical kind. She 
sought out those that abused dark magics, as well as using her gifts to 
aide and assist wherever she could.

But she never forgot about Tara...

Willow remembered a time during a visit to Japan, where she had walked 
into an out of the way bar in Tokyo, discovering to her pleasure that it 
was for women only. It had been Valentine&#39;s Day and watching the couples 
together had almost hurt her physically. Gathering up her courage, she 
had taken to the karaoke stage and sang.

&quot;This is dedicated,&quot; the brown haired girl smiled out at the crowd 
sadly, &quot;to the one I loved.&quot; She pressed the keys to bring up her 
selection, and a few seconds later, the music came on. Her voice was 
sad, and it&#39;s sorrow reached to all corners of the Locket, reminding 
them all that love, sometimes, wasn&#39;t forever.

&quot;There&#39;s a Victorian tin, I keep my memories in, I found it up in the 
attic, after looking inside I find the things that I&#39;m hiding, The 
leaves saved from a mistletoe kiss, Only nostalgia has me feeling like 
this, Like I miss you, It must be the time of year,

Remember, December, It&#39;s like a winter dream beside a diamond stream, 
Remember, December, The fall of snow and the afterglow. It could be 
taking our breath away, But the years stand in the way. Remember, 
December, How does it make you feel inside?&quot;

She finished, wiping gently at a tear at the corner of her eye. &quot;Tara, I 
miss you,&quot; Willow Rosenberg said softly, so softly the mic. barely 
picked it up.

The plane shook, and an announcement came on, &quot;We are now arriving at 
Los Angeles International Airport.&quot; She went to the bus station and 
caught the first available one to Sunnydale. She tried to doze, but the 
shaking of the bus was just a bit too much to sleep through.

Finally, as the sun began to rise, the bus pulled into the station. 
Willow walked out of the main building and smiled, seeing Giles standing 
there waiting for her. His brown hair had a bit more gray to it, and 
somehow he looked even more British, but other than that he hadn&#39;t 
changed much.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; Giles smiled, taking her bags and walking them towards the 
parking lot. &quot;How was your trip?&quot; he asked.

Willow sighed, &quot;Long.&quot; She blinked in surprise at the convertible Giles 
was leading them to, &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s quite your style.&quot;

Giles smiled at her wryly, &quot;It&#39;s Faith&#39;s car.&quot; He opened up the 
passenger&#39;s side door, and Willow sighed in relief as she sat down. 
&quot;Dawn, Xander and the others are looking forward to seeing you again,&quot; 
he remarked as they smoothly left the lot. The city streets were quiet 
as they drove, and she shivered slightly.

At Giles&#39; questioning glance Willow quietly explained, &quot;I can still feel 
the Hellmouth beneath us. That, and the First.&quot;

Giles looked concerned, &quot;The prison is still holding?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Willow sighed sadly.

&quot;You did what was needed,&quot; Giles tried to reassure her.

&quot;Small comfort,&quot; Willow sighed.

Willow had helped devise the spell to hold the First captive, reasoning 
that if it could not be destroyed, it might at least be contained. But 
without her knowledge Buffy, Spike and Anya had chosen to perform the 
spell in her place, together becoming a living seal to prevent the First 
from ever returning to this plane.

&quot;I just wish there had been another way,&quot; Willow said.

Giles didn&#39;t choose to answer, pulling into the driveway of the Summers&#39; 
home. He smiled as he saw who was waiting, and quietly headed inside. 
Dawn was standing by the door, and ran out to throw her arms around 
Willow, &quot;I&#39;ve missed you!&quot;

Xander came down the stairs a bit slower, but his smile lit up his face. 
He put an arm around her shoulders, &quot;Good to see you.&quot;

She smiled up at him, looking remarkably goofy. &quot;I should stay away long 
periods of time more often,&quot; Willow smiled.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare,&quot; Dawn protested.

Xander laughed, &quot;I know you&#39;ve been busy.&quot; Willow looked at him 
questioningly, and he shrugged, &quot;Giles and the Coven have been giving us 
updates.&quot;

A figure hesitated on the porch, and Willow said softly to Xander and 
Dawn, &quot;You mind giving us a moment?&quot;

&quot;See you inside,&quot; Dawn smiled, nearly dragging Xander inside after her. 
The woman walked over to her and stopped, looking at her thoughtfully.

&quot;Hello, Kennedy,&quot; Willow smiled at her a bit sadly.

Kennedy hugged her close, and Willow could feel that it was a purely 
platonic gesture. &quot;I&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Kennedy sighed. She smiled at her a 
bit sadly, &quot;So are you happy, now that you&#39;ve finally found your 
purpose?&quot;

&quot;Content, maybe,&quot; Willow shrugged.

Kennedy frowned, &quot;She wouldn&#39;t have wanted you to be alone, I think.&quot;

Willow hesitated, not really wanting to talk about it, &quot;We should 
probably go inside. I bet Giles likely can&#39;t wait to brief us all on 
what&#39;s coming.&quot;

Kennedy looked like she really wanted to say something else to her, then 
with a little sigh, &quot;All right, let&#39;s go in.&quot;

Willow felt her guard going up almost as soon as she saw Faith leaning 
there against the wall. The dark haired Slayer had threatened her life 
once, and it was something that she found hard to forget. Still, Faith 
had become a better person during her time away, and it showed.

The Slayers in training were still a motley lot, but they clearly showed 
promise. They mostly sat together, talking quietly, and the sense of 
camaraderie that they had was gratifying. Kennedy didn&#39;t sit with them, 
though.

She walked over to stand at Faith&#39;s side, who slid her arms around 
Kennedy&#39;s shoulders. &#39;It&#39;s none of my business,&#39; Willow forced herself 
to think, trying not to look too startled.

Faith saw her reaction, and stepped away from Kennedy.

Giles gave her an apologetic glance. &quot;Thank you for coming so quickly,&quot; 
he said, shuffling his papers as he gathered his thoughts. &quot;It began 
almost exactly a year ago,&quot; Giles took on a lecturing tone, &quot;in Salem, 
Mass.&quot;

&quot;A vampire was preying on the townsfolk, but a mysterious women appeared 
and killed it. She did so using fire that she conjured from her hands,&quot; 
he explained.

Willow nodded thoughtfully as Giles listed all the appearances of the 
mystery woman, and the monsters that she had killed. He finished his 
report by saying, &quot;We expect that she&#39;ll reach Sunnydale tomorrow.&quot; He 
looked over at her expectantly, and she took a moment to digest what he 
said before she stood.

&quot;And there&#39;s no good descriptions?&quot; Willow asked Giles. He shook his 
head no, and she sighed, &quot;It appears we&#39;re dealing with an elemental 
mystic.&quot;

&quot;Which means?&quot; Xander asked. She saw the twinkle in his eye, and 
realized he was playing dumb to feed her a line.

&quot;She can control the four traditional elements,&quot; Willow smiled at him, 
&quot;earth, air, fire and water. Which means, magically, she&#39;s pretty 
powerful.&quot;

&quot;Can you take her?&quot; Faith asked bluntly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Willow was honest, &quot;and I&#39;m hoping I won&#39;t have to.&quot; She 
got some odd looks, so she asked Giles, &quot;Did the Coven pick up any evil 
or malice from her?&quot;

Giles looked thoughtful, &quot;No, not specifically. Just a great sense of 
purpose.&quot;

&quot;Then I do meet her tomorrow,&quot; Willow sighed, &quot;and we&#39;ll see what 
happens. If she&#39;s hostile, we&#39;ll handle it, but I do hope she might not 
be.&quot;

A few of the potential Slayers looked a bit dubious about that, but 
mostly there was a sense that Willow knew what she was talking about. It 
didn&#39;t take long for a more relaxed mood to fill the room, and 
conversation began to flow. Over an hour later, her throat a bit sore 
from talking so long, Willow retired to the porch for a break.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the quiet voice came out of the darkness. Willow turned to 
see Faith standing in the shadows, looking out at the street.

&quot;No need,&quot; Willow answered her softly.

&quot;I thought Kennedy had told you about us,&quot; Faith chose to explain 
anyway, &quot;or else I wouldn&#39;t have been so obvious.&quot;

Willow was just a little surprised to hear the honest concern in Faith&#39;s 
voice. &quot;I didn&#39;t really give her a chance,&quot; she admitted.

Faith turned to go inside, and quietly said over her shoulder, &quot;I&#39;ll 
back your play tomorrow, no matter what.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Willow smiled.
&quot;Why do these things always happen at night?&quot; Xander remarked to no one 
in particular.

Giles actually smiled slightly, &quot;Because it&#39;s easier if you&#39;re somewhat 
unusual looking to move around quietly at night.&quot;

&quot;So how do we know it&#39;s coming here?&quot; Faith asked, as they stood waiting 
in front of the Magic Box. The little shop had passed through various 
hands through the years, but it remained a center for real magic in 
Sunnydale.

Willow smiled privately, wondering how the others would take it if they 
knew she now owned it. &#39;Keep your mind on business,&#39; she reminded 
herself as she said aloud, &quot;We did a locator spell on elemental magic, 
and found that it was heading straight here.&quot;

&quot;Now can anyone tell me why?&quot; Kennedy asked.

&quot;That, we don&#39;t know,&quot; Giles admitted. He had managed to convince the 
other Slayer trainees and Dawn to stay at the house, but Kennedy had 
insisted on coming along.

Willow suddenly felt a presence, and gestured to the others to be 
silent.

She came around the corner silently, and seemed unsurprised to see them 
there. She was tall, nearly six foot, but still moved gracefully. Her 
long black hair flowed behind her, and the color of her eyes were pure 
scarlet. But her most startling feature was the elfin cast to her 
features, an almost unearthly beauty.

She looked at Giles first, searchingly, then Xander received the same 
treatment. &quot;What&#39;s she doing?&quot; he asked quietly.

&quot;Shhh!&quot; Faith shushed him.

Finally, her gaze settled on Willow, and she smiled.

Willow was frozen, the familiarity of that smile striking her to the 
very core. She took a few hesitant steps forward, felt the aura that 
this strange being carried, and somehow she just knew. &quot;Tara?&quot; Willow 
asked softly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she smiled at Willow gently.

Slowly, and silently, Willow crumpled to the ground in a dead faint.


Author&#39;s Notes: Due to popular demand, really. I&#39;ve gotten a fair number 
of requests from all the Willow/Tara fans, so I&#39;ve decided to continue 
this as a short series. Tara&#39;s return will be explained, I promise you, 
but not until next episode. I&#39;m such a stinker...

A section of this fic previously appeared as a piece of a chapter in my 
x- over series, Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.
