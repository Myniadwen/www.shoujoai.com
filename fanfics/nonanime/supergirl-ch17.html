<a href="../nonanime/supergirl-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>        &quot;Laurel,&quot; B-ko murmured her greeting as she got out of her limo, 
smiling at her dark haired friend waiting by the gate.

        &quot;B-ko,&quot; Laurel Kent smiled back as they fell into step moving 
towards the school. Laurel looked over at her with a slight smile, &quot;So 
how was your date with Helena?&quot;

        B-ko&#39;s cheeks went faintly red. &quot;She showed me her town,&quot; she 
said softly, &quot;and I got to meet her parents.&quot;

        &quot;Oh ho!&quot; Laurel smiled, &quot;That had to have been interesting.&quot;

        &quot;Actually, I rather liked Dinah and Barbara&quot; B-ko admitted.

        Laurel raised her eyebrows, &quot;Well, well. Helena has two 
Momnmies?&quot;

        B-ko gave her a dirty look, but didn&#39;t answer. &quot;So how did your 
reunion with Iris and Kyla go?&quot; she asked curiously.

        They went into the building together, exchanging respectful nods 
to the passing students. The matching school girl&#39;s uniforms the girl&#39;s 
wore helped them blend, even with the business suit variation that B-ko 
had special permision to wear.

        Laurel slung her bag over her shoulder, &quot;Pretty good, I think. 
We still have a lot in common, and they haven&#39;t changed all that much.&quot;

        &quot;Any surprises?&quot; B-ko asked curiously as they finally reached 
their homeroom, settling down into their usual seats.

        &quot;Kyla likes girls,&quot; Laurel shrugged, &quot;and Iris is still into 
boys. Too bad, the crush Kyla had on Iris when they were little girls 
was so cute.&quot;

        B-ko frowned thoughtfully, &quot;Poor Kyla.&quot;

        The teacher came in, bringing the class to attention. Both young 
women focused their eyes to the front, putting the conversation on hold 
for now. She beamed at them happily, &quot;We have a new exchange student 
joining us today, everyone.&quot;

        The door to the hallway slid open, and a blonde haired young 
woman can inside. She was good looking, her eyes scanning the crowd. She 
spotted B-ko and Laurel, a slight smile teasing her lips as she stepped 
up beside the teacher.

        &quot;This is D-ko R. Jones,&quot; the teacher smiled cheerfully, &quot;and she 
just transfered here from America. Everyone, please be kind to her.&quot;

        &#39;D-ko?&#39; B-ko thought, gazing at her robot maid in pure shock, 
&#39;What is she doing here?&#39; From the look on Laurel&#39;s face, she probably 
was thinking much the same thing.

        &quot;Very nice to meet you,&quot; D-ko beamed, bowing to the class.

        Over in the principal&#39;s office, the headmistress of the school 
was looking at the man who was standing in her office in disbelief. Her 
wore a long brown trenchcoat, a gray business suit beneath it, and an 
old style fedora was on his head. He looked like a private investigator 
from years ago, stepped right off of a movie screen.

        &quot;Mr...&quot; she looked down at the papers, &quot;Jones?&quot;

        &quot;John Jones,&quot; the disguised Martian Manhunter agreed with a 
slight smile.

        &quot;I was rather surprised by how suddenly you had to transfer your 
daughter to our school,&quot; she browsed through the paperwork, &quot;but 
everything seems to be in order.&quot;

        &#39;Thank you, Oracle,&#39; John thought, keeping his face entirely 
deadpan. &quot;If there&#39;s no problems, I have to go to work,&quot; he said 
crisply.

        &quot;No problem,&quot; the woman agreed a bit glumly. She perked up, 
&quot;Will your wife be stopping by here as well?&quot;

        John paused, &quot;I&#39;ll try to arrange it. What time would you like 
her to stop by?&quot;

        &quot;Could she come by, maybe pick your daughter up after class?&quot; 
she asked.

        John nodded, &quot;Of course.&quot; As he left he thought to himself, 
&#39;D-ko, you are really going to owe me for this one.&#39;

        It wasn&#39;t until lunch hour that B-ko and Laurel were able to 
pull D- ko aside and talk to her privately. It seemed that many of the 
boys and not a few girls were interested in getting to know the pretty 
little blonde better.

        &quot;All right,&quot; B-ko said as the three of them sat down on the 
grass, under the shade of a tree with their bento boxes, &quot;what&#39;s going 
on?&quot;

        &quot;It wasn&#39;t my idea,&quot; D-ko protested as she pulled open her 
bento, snapping her chopsticks apart and scooping up some rice.

        &quot;Oh, really?&quot; Laurel gave her a look.

        &quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t entirely my idea,&quot; D-ko admitted. &quot;Oracle and 
the Martian Manhunter were the ones who came up with this.&quot;

        &quot;I should have guessed,&quot; B-ko muttered softly. She looked over 
at B- ko thoughtfully, &quot;But I don&#39;t quite see why.&quot;

        &quot;To protect you two,&quot; D-ko answered simply.

        &quot;I don&#39;t need protecting,&quot; Laurel quickly protested, forgetting 
her role for a moment and sounding just like A-ko would.

        B-ko pushed her sleeve back, revealing the high-tech wristband 
she wore. &quot;And I can teleport a light suit of armor to me in a moment,&quot; 
she said coolly.

        &quot;And if an electromagnetic pulse fried the teleporter?&quot; D-ko 
asked softly. She gave Laurel a look, &quot;Or if they have kryptonite based 
weapons?&quot; She smiled, &quot;You designed me well, B-ko. I could get you both 
out before the situation got worse.&quot;

        B-ko met her creation&#39;s eyes, those blue eyes she had modelked, 
maybe unconsciously, on C-ko&#39;s. &quot;You might have a point,&quot; she admitted.

        Laurel didn&#39;t seem to want to agree, so instead she changed the 
subject. &quot;How did you manage to get in here, anyway?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Oracle manufactured the records I&#39;d need,&quot; D-ko explained, &quot;and 
J&#39;onn posed as my dad.&quot;

        &quot;That had to have been interesting,&quot; B-ko sweatdropped slightly, 
watching Laurel scarfing her food down.

        &quot;I wonder what they&#39;ll do when they ask to see your mother?&quot; 
Laurel asked impishly.

        &quot;I assume J&#39;onn will handle that as well,&quot; D-ko shrugged, eating 
her own food at a somewhat more normal pace.

        &quot;I&#39;d give a great deal to see that,&quot; B-ko had to smile.

        Lunch ended, and the three of them walked back to classes 
together. It was just a bit odd, watching the students trying to get 
D-ko&#39;s attention. &#39;I knew my programming and manufacture of her was 
good,&#39; B-ko mused, &#39;but is all of this my doing?&#39;

        For the past few months, D-ko had begun to show moments of 
independant thought and even free will. She still wasn&#39;t quite sure what 
had caused it, of course, but it was remarkable to see. The maid was 
evolving, growing beyond the limits of her original programing, and it 
left B-ko feeling both oddly proud and just a bit worried.

        B-ko was still lost in her thoughts when classes let out, both 
her, Laurel and D-ko walking from the school together. Over by the front 
gates a woman was talking to the school&#39;s head mistress, her cheerful 
manner quite an opposite to the other woman&#39;s dour manner.

        &quot;D-ko,&quot; the blonde called, waving a hand.

        &quot;Mom,&quot; D-ko replied, running forward.

        &quot;That&#39;s J&#39;onn?&quot; B-ko murmured, her eyes wide.

        &quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Laurel agreed.

        &quot;Mrs. Jones,&quot; the headmistress said faintly, &quot;it&#39;s so good to 
see you taking an interest in your daughter&#39;s education like this.&quot;

        &quot;Call me Kathy,&quot; J&#39;onn smiled charmingly, the form of a gorgeous 
blonde disguising the Martian beneath.

        &quot;We&#39;d better get going,&quot; D-ko tugged on the hand, the group 
moving off together.

        &quot;It&#39;s so good seeing a new girl make friends so quickly,&quot; the 
headmistress nodded firmly.

        B-ko kept her voice low as they walked, &quot;Did you have to pick a 
blonde bombshell?&quot;

        &quot;Well, it had to be a blonde to match D-ko,&quot; J&#39;onn said 
defensively, &quot;and this was the first thing that came to mind.&quot;

        &quot;But why Marilyn Munroe?&quot; Laurel asked faintly.

        &quot;I&#39;m impressed that you spotted that,&quot; J&#39;onn actually sounded 
pleased, &quot;so few people spot the historic references.&quot;

        D-ko sweatdropped, &quot;We are in so much trouble.&quot;</pre>
