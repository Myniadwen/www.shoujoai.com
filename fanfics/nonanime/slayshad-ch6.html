<h1>Slayer and Shadow (part 6 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/slayshad-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        The patrol they went out on the next day was.. interesting, 
to say the least. Willow, Buffy, Faith, and Giles all went out there 
together, which probably wasn&#39;t the best of plans. Faith was wary, 
Giles more than somewhat inexperienced, and the chemistry between 
Willow and Buffy generated an almost visible electricity in the air.

        &quot;You two work together like a well oiled machine,&quot; Giles 
murmured as he saw Willow and Buffy handle a pair of vampires.

        Faith staked her own vampire before muttering, &quot;I think 
that&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever heard that saying applied to vampire 
slaying.&quot; She pushed her black hair back from her face, sweat making 
her shirt stick to her body.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Buffy smiled wryly, her T-shirt and jeans a bit 
messy with dust.

        Willow stood slightly apart, her eyes closed as she tried to 
sense the presence of other vampires. Her long leather coat swirled 
around her, the leather corset and pants hugging her pale form. &quot;No 
sign,&quot; she reported, &quot;it looks like we&#39;re done here.&quot;

        Giles gave her a curious look, &quot;I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever 
heard of younger vampires with extra-sensory abilities.&quot; He really 
looked like a librarian then, dressed in a scholarly suit in dark 
colors, his glasses gleaming when they caught the light.

        Willow walked over to Buffy&#39;s side, not taking her hand but 
just being near her. She smiled slightly, &quot;I started being able to 
do it after I regained my soul, but I&#39;m not sure why.&quot;

        &quot;She should have been a wiccan,&quot; the quiet voice startled 
them all. Tara stalked out of the shadows, the slightly heavy brown 
haired woman looking focused and intense.

        Willow flinched, turning slightly aside from the woman&#39;s 
gaze. Buffy looked at her worriedly, then over at Tara who was 
glaring at the vampire. Faith smiled wryly, &quot;Looks like you two have 
some history together.&quot;

        &quot;We do,&quot; Willow didn&#39;t add anything else.

        An awkward silence stretched out until Giles cleared his 
throat uncomfortably. &quot;As it seems that patrol has ended, we might 
consider turning in for the night.&quot; He made a face, &quot;Some of us do 
have day jobs to consider.&quot;

        &quot;Poor ol&#39; Giles ,&quot; Faith gave him a little smirk. She looked 
over at Buffy and Willow and added, &quot;He&#39;s probably right, though.&quot; 
With that, both of them walked away, Faith continuing to gently bug 
Giles as they went.

        The three remaining stood there a moment until Willow puffed 
out a breath, more from reflex than any real need. &quot;Buffy?&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Buffy looked over at her worriedly.

        &quot;Would you mind meeting me at home later?&quot; Willow asked. She 
looked over at Tara, then back at Buffy, &quot;I have something to deal 
with.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re going with her?&quot; Buffy asked, frowning at 
Tara. &quot;Can&#39;t say I&#39;m thrilled with this. Can&#39;t I come along with 
you?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;No harm will come to the vampire,&quot; Tara said to Buffy 
crisply, &quot;I give you my word.&quot;

        Buffy still looked stubborn, so Willow softly said to 
her, &quot;I did some very bad things to the coven, Buffy. If they want 
me for something, I really can&#39;t refuse them.&quot;

        Buffy frowned, but finally nodded reluctantly when she saw 
the appeal in Willow&#39;s eyes. &quot;All right,&quot; she conceded, &quot;but promise 
you&#39;ll be careful.&quot; A pause, &quot;I want you back, please.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll be careful,&quot; Willow agreed. She hesitated a moment, 
then leaned forward to gently press her lips to the startled Buffy&#39;s 
cheek. &quot;See you later.&quot;

        Buffy watched her go, hand held to her cheek and eyes wide 
in surprise.

        They walked together for awhile in silence, the vampire and 
wiccan. &quot;She really cares about you,&quot; Tara said quietly.

        &quot;Yes, she does,&quot; Willow agreed. She looked over at the brown 
haired woman beside her, &quot;I wish I could undo what I did.&quot;

        &quot;That doesn&#39;t do my lover any good,&quot; Tara&#39;s voice was ice 
cold as she continued, &quot;it won&#39;t bring my Amy back to me.&quot;

        &quot;I know,&quot; Willow answered her softly. She chose her next 
words very carefully, &quot;Before, I had no conscience, didn&#39;t care what 
I did. When the Master ordered me to attack your coven, I did it 
without a second thought.&quot;

        Tara gave Willow a odd look before saying, &quot;If you&#39;re 
pleading your case, you&#39;re not doing a very good job of it.&quot;

        &quot;But now, with my soul restored to me I have a conscience 
again,&quot; Willow said bleakly, &quot;and the things I once did haunt me, 
Tara.&quot; Her voice dropped to a whisper, &quot;Even if you killed me, it 
would not punish me more than my own soul does.&quot;

        At the edge of town they passed through the trees of the 
park, eventually emerging into a secluded clearing. A circle of 
figures stood, gathered around a fire, all with cloaks covering 
their faces except one. She was older, her eyes dark and intense, 
and a vivid scar ran down her cheek, disappearing beneath her cloak.

        &quot;Jenny,&quot; Willow breathed out.

        Jenny Calendar hadn&#39;t changed all that much from when she 
was Willow&#39;s computer teacher, back when Sunnydale high was still 
running. And later on, when Willow had faced the coven Jenny had 
been there. Willow had charged them, catching her by surprise as she 
swiftly dug fangs in the woman&#39;s throat, tearing the flesh away.

        &quot;It&#39;s been a long time,&quot; Jenny said quietly.

        Part of Willow wanted to run away, to flee and never come 
back here again. But the vampire drew on her will, stepping forward 
and meeting those eyes, &quot;You called me here.&quot;

        &quot;Tara?&quot; Jenny looked over at her.

        &quot;She has a soul,&quot; Tara confirmed softly, &quot;that I&#39;m certain 
of. How, I don&#39;t know.&quot;

        Willow blinked. Whatever she had been expecting, that wasn&#39;t 
it. &quot;Is that why you called me out here?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Such a great magic should have sent waves across the 
world,&quot; Jenny said gravely, &quot;but none felt it happen. Unless you 
regained your soul spontaneously, it concerns us gravely.&quot;

        Willow smiled wryly, &quot;It&#39;s a bit of a long story, and I&#39;m 
not quite sure where to start.&quot;

        &quot;Pick a place and call it the beginning if you must,&quot; Jenny 
smiled at her slightly, &quot;and then continue on to the end.&quot;

        &quot;For me,&quot; Willow said quietly, &quot;it began when I disappeared 
from the Master&#39;s factory and appeared in another Sunnydale...&quot;

        It took some time for Willow to try to explain all that she 
had seen and experienced there, meeting the other Willow and Tara 
there, their battle, and her eventual return home. Tactfully she 
also edited out what she had done to that world&#39;s version of Amy. 
From the look on Tara&#39;s face, she had more than enough to deal with.

        Tara&#39;s face was pale as she looked at Willow with a clearly 
ill expression, &quot;You and I?&quot;

        &quot;Different circumstances,&quot; Willow said crisply, &quot;different 
people.&quot; She looked over at Jenny. softening her tone, &quot;I hope that 
helps.&quot;

        Jenny was still looking calm and serene, but it was a bit of 
a effort. She gestured, &quot;Could you come over here?&quot;

        Willow moved over in front of the wiccan, who reached out to 
gently lay her hands on the vampire&#39;s shoulders. Willow shivered as 
power shifted around her, &quot;Hope this doesn&#39;t hurt.&quot;

        The power died down a moment later, and Jenny released 
her. &quot;She speaks the truth,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;I can feel the 
traces of power still on her.&quot; Her voice dropped to a whisper, &quot;The 
other Willow must be touched by the goddess.&quot;

        Tara snorted. &quot;I find it hard to believe that any 
incarnation of Willow could be touched by the goddess,&quot; she scowled.

        &quot;You did not know Willow before she became a vampire,&quot; was 
the only answer Jenny gave. She pulled her cloak up, her face in 
shadow as she said to Willow, &quot;You did grave harm to the coven, 
Willow. That debt will be called due someday.&quot; A pause, &quot;Be ready.&quot;

        &quot;I will,&quot; Willow answered softly before Tara led her away.
