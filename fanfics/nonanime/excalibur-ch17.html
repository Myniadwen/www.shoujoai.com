<h1>The Excalibur Alternative (part 17 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>        Pete Wisdom sighed to himself softly as he sat down to review 
his email account. using a command center station late at night. About 
half his nearly full inbox went right into the trash, a few of the more 
interesting adult spam&#39;s he put aside to deal with later on. Finally, 
and only with the greatest reluctance, did he open up an email that was 
marked from Professor Charles Xavier.

        &quot;Mr. Wisdom,&quot; the mail from Xavier read, and he could almost 
imagine the lecturing tone in his voice, &quot;I was wondering if you could 
please put together your impressions of your new teammates in Excalibur? 
This information could be quite useful in coordinating your team&#39;s 
activities along with the other x-teams.&quot;

        &quot;Gah,&quot; Pete made a face at that. He hated doing paperwork 
anyway, especially of this kind, but... &quot;If I don&#39;t do it,&quot; he finally 
grumbled to himself, &quot;I&#39;ll probably just get nagged about it until I 
do.&quot; He got up to fill up his coffee to keep himself awake, then lit up 
a smoke.

        The word processing program opened up, and Pete created a new 
blank document. &quot;Now how the &#39;ell do I do this..&quot; he muttered softly. 
After a bit of thought he decided to go through his teammates in 
chronological order, more or less. For a moment he wondered how a file 
on him would look like, but he could probably guess...

Pete Wisdom: A former operative of the British Intelligence community, 
who was employed by Black Air. Assigned to Excalibur as an observer, he 
participated in an operation in Genosha. Working along with Katherine 
Pryde he discovered the criminal activities that Black Air was involved 
with. Resigning he joined Excalibur, remaining a member of the team 
until a dispute with Kitty caused him to resign. Worked with X-Force, 
faked his own death to go underground before reemerging to assist the 
Weird Happenings Organization (WHO).

        &quot;Bollocks,&quot; Pete sighed. He leaned back, lighting up a smoke as 
he considered what to do. &quot;I hate time travel,&quot; he muttered as he began 
to type.

Widget, a.k.a. Kate Pryde: Caught in a Sentinel trap, the future Kate 
Pryde was killed in a temporal experiment. Her mind shattered, her 
life-essence traveled back in time, eventually being contained in the 
Widget Robot. Possessed of unpredictable teleportational abilities 
Widget was as much of a curse to the team as a blessing. Repaired, 
Widget&#39;s consciousness returned, eventually regaining the full knowledge 
of her past. Kate led Excalibur into the future, battling alongside 
Rachel Summers to shut the Sentinels down. She stayed in that era for a 
time, but after building a more humanoid body she ultimately turned up 
in my living room asking to join Excalibur.

        Pete took a long drag. &quot;I really bloody hate time travel,&quot; he 
sighed, hoping the last paragraph made sense. He didn&#39;t include his own 
confusion about Kate, it was personal. In some ways she was the girl he 
had fell for, but in others entirely different. &quot;Not to mention being 
hung up on Rachel,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Speaking of which..&quot;

Rachel Summers: (No, I don&#39;t know her bloody codename, as her ma is 
Phoenix now..) the time traveling daughter of Scott Summers and Jean 
Grey she escaped a Sentinel ruled future to join the X-men in the here 
and now. A founding member of Excalibur she was lost to the team in a 
temporal incident, throwing her into the far future to found the society 
that would eventually help Nathan Summers, a.k.a. Cable. Returning to 
the Twenty-first century she went undercover to hide from the Dark 
Sisterhood, at least until I talked her into joining the new Excalibur.

        Pete reached over to take a slurp of his now warm coffee. 
&quot;Wonder if I should mention that Kate&#39;s in love with her?&quot; he mused. He 
thought about it, then shook his head, &quot;Nah. I don&#39;t know if Rachel 
returns her feelings, and either way it ain&#39;t Xavier&#39;s business.&quot;

Britannia, a.k.a. Lisa Garrison: Some people might remember that there 
were two Captain Britains for a bit, but most don&#39;t remember the third. 
Elizabeth Braddock wore the suit, operating as Captain Britain until she 
was blinded by one of Cap&#39;s old enemies, Slaymaster. The suit itself 
disappeared, but Black Air tracked it down. They were in the process of 
modifying it when Excalibur shut them down, and the suit ended up with 
WHO.

        &quot;Bit dry,&quot; Pete muttered before going back to type the rest of 
the entry.

Lisa Garrison, the suit&#39;s current owner, has worked for both STRIKE and 
WHO, and we&#39;ve had a few run ins over the years for our respective 
organizations. A very capable officer, one WHO only let go when 
politicians raised a stink over her elven girlfriend. Allistair Stuart 
recommended her to me, and so far she&#39;s made a fine teammate.

        &quot;Allistair,&quot; Pete sighed to himself. He wasn&#39;t quite sure how 
far to trust the new director of WHO, to be honest. The man came across 
like a typical befuddled scientist, but Pete was pretty certain that was 
just a pose. Whatever was beneath it was what he wondered about...

Wolfsbane, a.k.a. Rhane Sinclair: raised, if you want to call it that, 
by Reverend Craig, the redhead was declared a werewolf when her power 
first manifested itself. Saved from the Reverend by Moira MacTaggart she 
found care and acceptance for the first time, coming to look on the 
Scotts woman as a second mother. Training with the New Mutants Rhane met 
Dani Moonstar, a deep bond forming almost instantly between them. She 
left the team to join X-factor, then ultimately became a member of the 
previous Excalibur when it was based out of Moira&#39;s mutant research 
station. Moira&#39;s death devastated her, and that pain called Dani 
Moonstar back to her side.

        &quot;Wonder if I should put in our speculation that Craig might be 
Rhane&#39;s biological dad? Nah, never proven. And if Xavier don&#39;t know that 
Dani and Rhane are lovers,&quot; Pete made a face, &quot;then he&#39;s got to be 
blind. On to the other member of the pair..&quot;

Dani Moonstar: (She&#39;s using her last name as a codename, and I ain&#39;t 
typing it twice!) A native American mutant raised on the reservation 
until her parents disappeared. When she first joined the New Mutants she 
was able to manifest illusions of a person&#39;s greatest fears and desires, 
so she called herself Mirage. She and Rhane bonded almost immediately, 
developing a bit of a sisterly relationship. Injured in an adventure 
with Asgardian Valkyries she left the team, eventually taking a page 
from my book and going undercover as the &#39;villainess&#39; Moonstar. 
Eventually becoming a reserve X-Men she rushed to Rhane&#39;s side when the 
girl needed her once again after Moira&#39;s death.

        &quot;Asgardian Valkyries...&quot; Pete shook his head. If he hadn&#39;t heard 
about the X-men&#39;s adventures in Asgard from Kitty herself, he probably 
wouldn&#39;t have believed it. In an odd way it was comforting to know that 
the X-Men had been involved in almost as much weird stuff as he had. 
Probably met he&#39;d fit right in, or something.

Spitfire, a.k.a. Jacqueline Farnsworth Crighton: the daughter of the 
British hero Union Jack, she was badly injured in World War II. An 
emergency blood transfusion from the android Human Torch saved her life, 
but also triggered a latent super-speed ability. Alongside the heroes 
called the Invaders she fought the Nazis, retiring not long after the 
war ended. A few years ago Jacqueline attended a reunion of the 
surviving Invaders, and got tangled up with a group of neo-Nazis. Badly 
injured she was given a second transfusion from the Human Torch, with an 
unexpected side effect: she reverted to being a teen again. More 
recently she&#39;s been manifesting unpredictable thermal abilities, and 
Excalibur contacted her to offer our assistance.

        Pete killed the last of his coffee, drinking down the cold 
dregs. &quot;Who in their right mind would allow an android to give a blood 
transfusion in the first place?&quot; he questioned aloud. &quot;I&#39;d have thought 
Captain America, at least, would have had a bit more common sense.&quot;

Dr. Cecelia Reines: (She&#39;s not technically a member, but I&#39;ll be dealing 
with her pretty regularly, so...) Cecelia joined the X-men during the 
craziness of Operation Zero Tolerance, when her emergency room was 
attacked by the Prime Sentinels. The African-American, along side the 
unlikely team of Iceman and the heroine Sabra helped stop Zero 
Tolerance, then became a somewhat reluctant X-Man. She became pretty 
good at using her personal forcescreen both offensively and defensively, 
but she never particularly enjoyed being an member of the X-Men, and 
quickly took the position here at Muir Island when the Prof. offered it.

        &quot;Guess that&#39;s it for now,&quot; Pete sighed as he rubbed at his eyes 
tiredly. He saved the file, then copied it over to the email program. He 
attached it to a mail to the Professor, and a click of the mouse sent it 
on it&#39;s way. &quot;Now, to bed,&quot; and with that he staggered off.</pre>
