Rival cried out in pain and surprise as Flash slugged
her, the gold clad villainess staggered by the blow.
&quot;Bitch,&quot; Rival hissed, blood trickling down her cheek.

&quot;You attacked my brother,&quot; Flash growled back, the red
clad heroine clearly enraged, &quot;he&#39;s barely hanging
on!&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s not dead?&quot; Rival blinked, looking honestly
surprised as she added, &quot;Damn, next time I&#39;ll have to
do a better job.&quot;

&quot;Arr!&quot; Flash made a incoherent noise of rage as she
attacked.

&quot;Think we should help?&quot; Roulette asked her teammates,
her red hair flowing down on the shoulders of her
gambler&#39;s costume.

Vox laughed as the blonde watched the fight, &quot;No, I
think the League will be here soon enough. They&#39;ll
keep us busy.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it,&quot; Metallix purred, the
silver metal skinned woman flexing her talon like
fingers.

&quot;Well, I think they&#39;re finally coming,&quot; Scarecrow
laughed, the black haired nodding as a shimmer of
light appeared in the business district nearby them
signaling a teleport. The city around them was
burning, chaos ruling as fear panicked people rampaged
through the streets due to scarecrow&#39;s potent fear
drugs.

&quot;Better call in the reserves,&quot; Roulette murmured,
pressing a stud on her bracelet.

Supergirl led the charge, &quot;Everyone, containment
operations! Manhunter, see if you can calm the crowds
with your telepathy.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do what I can,&quot; the green skinned Martian
Manhunter agreed, taking up a spot on a nearby
building as he sent out his will.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to help Flash,&quot; Firestorm started, the
flaming haired young man looking visibly distressed at
seeing the blurs as both speedsters fought at
hyper-speed.

&quot;No,&quot; Kestrel shook her head as the black and purple
garbed woman said, &quot;none of us are fast enough to do
anything.&quot;

Dr. Fate&#39;s golden cape swirled as she confronted a
black clad figure in midair high above the teams,
mystical energies flasring. &quot;EID!&quot; the Enchantress
cried, shadowy energies swirling around then engulfing
the golden heroine.

With a blaze of energy Fate was free, her white hair
shining as she smiled coldly. &quot;You&#39;ll have to do
better than that,&quot; she said. Her tone softened, &quot;We
don&#39;t have to do this, Zatanna.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t call me that,&quot; Zatanna snarled, &quot;Ezeerf!&quot;

For a second a block of ice materialized around Fate,
but with inhuman strength she shattered it. &quot;We can
free you from the Enchantress&#39; influence,&quot; she urged,
&quot;just give us a chance.&quot;

&quot;Never!&quot; Enchantress howled.

Green Lantern swept down in a flash of green only to
slam into a yellow barrier. &quot;What the...?&quot; Kyla Scott
blurted, looking around in confusion.

&quot;Bet you didn&#39;t know that there was still a Sinestro
ring around?&quot; the young man with the golden ring
smirked, his costume a simple purple one-piece.

&quot;I guess the Weaponmasters have been busy,&quot; Kyla said
as she used her ring to sweep away the barrier, &quot;but
the Guardians showed us how to beat the yellow
weakness.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; he sneered, racing in, &quot;my ring is still as
powerful as yours!&quot;

&quot;But is your will?&quot; Kyla asked as they rammed together
in a blaze of power.

Energy danced as Firestorm shot bolts on nuclear fire,
hampered by his inability to effect organic matter.
Instead he had to try to transmute matter to contain
his foes, a task easier said than done. &quot;I should have
stayed in the Watchtower with Aquaman and Hawkwoman,&quot;
he muttered.

Metallix&#39;s claws raked across B-ko&#39;s Steel armor, the
young women coming together in a shower of sparks. &quot;I
nearly beat you last time,&quot; Metallix purred, &quot;you were
lucky to have Supergirl to save you!&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; B-ko snarled, her blue hair flowing as she
tried to punch, her foes body flowing like water away
from the blow.

&quot;I&#39;m going to enjoy this,&quot; Metallix lunged in.

&quot;I doubt that,&quot; B-ko said as she flipped a small
canister she pulled from her suit right into her
enemy&#39;s path.

&quot;Wha..&quot; the canister burst then spilled over Metallix,
steam clouding everyone&#39;s view. One it cleared
Metallix stood stiff as a statue, unable to move a
inch.

&quot;I remembered our last fight,&quot; B-ko smiled, &quot;and
packed liquid nitrogen, just in case.&quot; She stepped
forward and tapped her with a knuckle, shattering her
foe.

&quot;You didn&#39;t kill her, did you?&quot; Kestrel asked, trading
blows with Scarecrow.

&quot;She can reform,&quot; B-ko promised, &quot;it&#39;ll take a while,
though.&quot;

Supergirl raced towards Roulette, determined to take
out the leader but before she could reach her she was
hammered out of the sky! &quot;What in the...&quot; she blinked,
taking in the figure dressed in purple and green
armor.

&quot;You didn&#39;t think that we&#39;d not be prepared for you?&quot;
Roulette smiled coldly. &quot;Surplus Lexcorp armor is
commonplace, but this suit has a fragment of
Kryptonite for a power source.&quot;

&quot;That...won&#39;t stop me,&quot; Supergirl forced herself to
stand.

Kestrel kicked Scarecrow in the head, sending the
scientist crumbling to the ground. &quot;We&#39;ve got to get
our acts together,&quot; she snarled in frustaration.

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t,&quot; Vox raised her voice and screamed,
her sonic power hammering everyone on the battlefield,
hero and villain alike.

&quot;You stupid,&quot; Roulette cursed blood running from her
ears. Seeing Supergirl fallen from the sonics she
ordered, &quot;Finish her!&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; the mercenary raised a gauntleted fist.

&quot;No,&quot; Supergirl caught the swiftly falling fist.

&quot;NO&quot; the voice echoed in all their minds, &quot;A-KO WILL
NOT BE HARMED.&quot;

&quot;What in the...?&quot; Kestrel blurted, rattled for the
first time in the fight.

&quot;C-ko,&quot; Supergirl breathed out, recognizing the voice.

&quot;Cylene,&quot; Roulette found her lips moving without her
control, her eyes wide with fear and alarm, &quot;that is
my true name, beloved.&quot;

&quot;This is incredible...&quot; B-ko muttered. &quot;J&#39;onn?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t stop her,&quot; the Martian Manhunter admitted as
he soared down to their side, &quot;Cylene&#39;s mind is
incredibly powerful.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Roulette said, her eyes silently pleading
for help. She looked at B-ko, &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you
happy at last.&quot;

&quot;Ah.. Thank you,&quot; B-ko managed.

&quot;Too bad it won&#39;t last,&quot; Roulette seemed to writhe,
fighting to control her body. &quot;Warworld is coming, and
nothing you can do will stop it.&quot;

&quot;How are you able to do this?&quot; Green Lantern asked,
Kyla carrying her foe in a power ring created cage.

&quot;I was able to communicate with Roulette across
interstellar distances,&quot; Roulette&#39;s voice was smug as
she said, &quot;this near I can control her easily.&quot;

&quot;So why aren&#39;t you taking us over?&quot; A-ko asked warily.

&quot;Where would the fun be in that?&quot; Roulette collapsed
bonelessly, along with most of the other villains as
Cylene&#39;s voice continued, &quot;I give you these villains
as a gift, clearly they are not powerful enough to
serve us. Once Warworld arrives I advise
surrender...it may let you live.&quot; With that the voice
was gone, leaving the heroes with as many questions as
answers.</pre>
