<h1>Azkaban (part 8 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/azkaban-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>It was at that moment, after the first class of Defense Against the Dark
Arts, that Alicia formed a differing opinion from the others she usually
agreed with.

As expected, Defense Against the Dark Arts zoomed into the stratosphere
and became most people&#39;s favorite class... with the exception of certain
Slytherins, and one very unimpressed Alicia Spinnet.

&quot;Look at the state of his robes,&quot; Malfoy grumbled in a loud &quot;whisper&quot; as
Professor Lupin passed. &quot;He dresses like our old hou--&quot; (FWACK!!) &quot;--!!!&quot;

Alicia, passing by Malfoy in turn, sneered at him. &quot;Blah blah blah.&quot;

Her dislike of the class seemed to grow once she went to the second class
and got a taste of Redcaps.

These creatures, goblinlike entities that haunted places of bloodshed,
briefly broke free during the class only to get a good hard look at
Alicia, and promptly look as if they were about to cry (before being
&quot;caught&quot;).

&quot;I&#39;m not that violent.&quot; Alicia muttered, her eyes wandering over towards
the rather ravenous Hermione who seemed to be more intent on eating lunch
than talking. &quot;Is it time for your flea medicine yet, Hermione dear?
Otherwise your coat seems to be nice and shiny... matches your wolf-like
appetite.&quot;

Nothing. She continued to eat without either stopping or looking up. &quot;Is
your nose moist? You&#39;re in good health if you have a wet nose...&quot; Silence.
Nothing she said seemed to rouse the slightest reaction from Hermoine as
of late, the story of Alicia&#39;s life lately it seems.

When she wasn&#39;t eating she was studying like crazy, and when she wasn&#39;t
studying like crazy she was sleeping or doing disappearing acts or
something. Weird. She&#39;s been weird ever since she came to school this
year and her oddness hasn&#39;t stopped for a single second. Disappointing.

If anything the discouraging turn of events with Hermione seemed to make
her hate Defense Against The Dark Arts all the more, if only to the fact
that it was something that made other people happy (which she presently
didn&#39;t feel like being right now). Third class didn&#39;t help her change her
opinion about the class as she continued to lose interest in the class
the moment she entered the third class and Kappas was the topic.

Most of the class got the very normal cranky gripey pissed off reaction
as the Kappa looked at them, watching each and everyone pass by with a
look of total hate. But as Alicia went up to it it stopped looking
cranky, and... started singing in it&#39;s mind. For a thing that enjoyed long
walks on large lakesides and strangling wandering people it sure had a
bad habit of latching onto the wrong people... like Alicia.

&quot;I blame Animal Crossing for it&#39;s ill attempt at courting.&quot; Alicia
grumbled, knowing that she was effectively talking to herself now. Ron
and Harry were reading the latest Quidditch Quarterly while they were
eating, and nobdoy else was nearby to listen to her complain. How
wonderous for Alicia (she said to herself).

Potions was easier for her, and everyone, since Alicia had a conversation
with Snape right after the whole Boggart incident. At first Snape fumed
and flared at the mention of the class, but she knew he would so she went
right to the throat and said &quot;Guess having an old class bully as an
associate sucks, eh?&quot;

That silenced his complaints dead on, and no more was heard from him on
the topic.

It was no coincidence that Lupin picked out Neville for the first go with
the Boggart, or for the finale. He knew that Neville had problems with
Snape (who didn&#39;t know that) and he used it just for the results that
happened. &quot;Despite the fact he is supposed to be so &quot;mature&quot; he still
seems to get his jollies off mocking you.&quot; Alicia muttered, leaning back
in the chair next to Snape&#39;s desk staring at the ceiling, &quot;Childish, eh?&quot;

Snape did not respond, but he wasn&#39;t grumbling either now so she knew he
agreed with her.

&quot;By the way got turned down for that transfer, eh? Always the birdesmaid
and never the bride.&quot;

&quot;You have no idea.&quot; he finally muttered, still working on the paperwork
before him.

But the point was reached. Snape didn&#39;t give anyone the time of day who
tried to draw him into the whole Boggart thing, and if they did they soon
found themselves with sufficent &quot;reason&quot; to &quot;drop it&quot; (though nobody
would say what &quot;reasoning&quot; Snape used to convince them of the error of
their ways).

&#145;Just as well,&#39; Alicia thought to herself, &#145;Not interested in the inner
workings of the socially insecure considering my own social life seems to
be in the toilet lately.&#39;

If only Divinations was as easy.... Too bad it wasn&#39;t.

Between trading an endless stream of &quot;I know the future better than you&quot;
retorts with Trelawney, she was puzzling over the confusing and very Rube
Goldberg styles of divination that Trelawney seemed to love to make them
learn. Some of the girls like Parvati Patil and Lavendar Brown became so
obsessed with the class that they spent their lunchtimes in there, but
Alicia just couldn&#145;t see the appeal in that kind of obsessive compulsive
behavior. One time Angelina &amp; Katie said they wanted to go to these
lunchtime divinations, until Alicia shook her head and said &quot;They&#39;re not
making out in class during lunch, you know. Just so you know.&quot; and that
silenced that from the two. Too bad that was the only &quot;silence&quot; from
them.

Otherwise they were all about the school like newlyweds, holding hands
and giggling together and sharing food and what-not. They traipsed around
the school like girls in love, and yes they were girls in love... but
still, that was abit much for Alicia who wished it was her on cloud 9
like they were.

Now if she could only convince her &quot;keeper&quot; May that class wasn&#39;t for
making out despite the fact she seemed to do nothing but fawn over
Neville in class a lot then she&#145;d be happier, especially since she had no
more respect for Divination than the often uptight and irritated Hermione
(who had a hate of Trelawney that was even worst than Alicia&#39;s own
dislike of the teacher) that would be a sense of progress for her.

Anyway at least, thankfully, she wasn&#39;t Harry Potter. Trelawney keeps
staring at him expecting him to drop dead at any moment... or self
destruct... or drop dead and self destruct. Whatever floated her crystal
ball.

The most interesting class, for all the wrong reasons, was Hagrid&#39;s. It
didn&#39;t rate quite as high as Defense Against the Dark Arts, but it had
it&#39;s rabid followers since a certain somebody quickly moved in to keep
Hagrid from becoming discouraged after the events of his first class.

Somehow May convinced him to carry on, and while the class lineups sure
looked interesting enough, the entire class was all smoke and mirrors
with much flash and bang and no substance.

The creatures now appearing in the class looked fierce enough, and for
all intents and purposes they seemed hot blooded and hard core to the
unknowing students... but that was all a lie.

It all started with the second class and the appearance of the Greywall
SaberBlades, Elfin wolves that supposidly ran into battle with battalions
of elfin warriors, that the &quot;gig&quot; was effectively &quot;up&quot; for Alicia. They
looked the part and were quite impressive, but were as much real wolves
as Alicia was straight. The Greywall SaberBlades were, in fact,
shapeshifters who performed nightly in a Edenina version of Las Vegas
(based in the same location as Vegas on Terra, the Earthian dream moon).
They looked cool, did their thing fine, and seemed genuine... but were
faker than Malfoy&#145;s &quot;personality&quot; (which was truly fake) if only to
Alicia who had actually seen their act when she was -- well, when she was
her other self in the past.

The rest, as expected, came from the Las Vegas Primetime Show Revue after
that, totally cool to look at but with very little actual threat.
Obviously this was a win-win for Hagrid : He won because the creatures
were impressive and class favorites, and he won because the creatures
were also quite safe to work with and guaranteed no more incidents like
the first day. Nice but really... at this point Alicia almost expected May
to import a batch of white tigers from the Siegfred &amp; Roy catalog soon
and pass them off as rare elfin housecats... it had to happen, especially
since the last batch looked like they came from the Barnum &amp; Bailey Dream
Circus performing over at the NekoDrome nightly (thrice on weekends).

At the start of October, however, Alicia began to find a new thing to
trouble her already worry plagued year (if her year couldn&#145;t be anymore
troubled than it already was). It wasn&#39;t bad enough that she was having a
hard time bonding with Hermione, while runaway romance couple roommates
Angelina &amp; Katie were going all out in their romance, now something else
had to bite into her time and take up more of it than she was willing to
give up : Quidditch practice.

The time had come for the Quidditch season to begin, and this year would
be a hardship since they had a basketcase of a &quot;fearless leader&quot; who,
after spending months stalking each and every one of them, was ready for
his nervous breakdown. That day came one Thursday as he called everyone
into the locker rooms on the Quidditch pitch near the school.

The room was ghastly cold. It was as if the spectre of doom hovered in
the room, mocking Wood, chilling him to his very soul... along with
everyone else unlucky enough to be in the same room with him at that
exact moment and that exact time.

&quot;Damn his Demon Lord of Terror.&quot; Alicia hissed beneath her breath,
wishing she had worn her cold protected battle uniform beneath her usual
robes. &quot;I&#39;m going to die of frostbite and haunt Wood forever.&quot;

Oliver Wood, pacing about, looked like he was about to start crying. The
burly 17 year old had this rather obvious (though still creepily silent)
desperation about him as he paced about like a caged animal, his voice
strained a little as he finally addressed everyone in the chilled room
(the light from outside fading fast as night began to fall over the
land).

&quot;This is our last chance -- my last chance -- to win the Quidditch Cup,&quot;
he told them, pacing up and down in front of them nervously, &quot;I&#39;ll be
leaving at the end of this year. I&#39;ll never get another shot at it.&quot;

An errie silence fillled the room briefly as he gathered his thoughts,
before forging forward with his pre-prepared and pre-rehearsed speech
(that Alicia has already been victimzed by four hours prior as he had
caught her in an empty class and made her listen to it).

&quot;Gryffindor hasn&#39;t won for seven years running. Seven years... sure, we&#39;ve
had the worst damnable luck in the world it seems, what with injuries and
the tournament being called off due to the whole thing over the
Basilisk...&quot; Wood spoke, swallowing hard as he remembered that incident
with particular bitterness. &quot;But despite all that we also know that we&#39;ve
got the best -- damn -- ruddy -- team -- in -- the -- whole school!&quot; he
hissed, forcing each words from his lips one at a time, swinging his fist
hard punching it into his open hand, as if to punctuate that statement.

&quot;We&#39;ve got three superb Chasers.&quot;

Alicia nodded absently, her eyes glancing over towards the attentive
Angelina &amp; Katie, almost muttering &quot;Two lovesick Chasers&quot; but thinking
better of it.

&quot;We&#39;ve got two unbeatable Beaters.&quot;

&quot;Stop it, Oliver, you&#39;re embarrassing us!&quot; Fred and George chorous
together, to which Alicia almost wanted to hiss &quot;Not likely.&quot;

&quot;And we&#39;ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!&quot;

Finally Alicia&#39;s eyes spun to Harry, who sat attentive without any
remarks like the Weasley brothers.

&quot;And me,&quot; Wood finally completed, almost as an afterthought.

&quot;We think you&#39;re very good too, Oliver.&quot; George said, finally focusing on
someone other than himself.

&quot;Spanking good Keeper,&quot; Fred chimed in.

&quot;The point is,&quot; Oliver continued, not wanting for a second to be thrown
from his speech (as if he was afraid he would not be able to continue if
he stopped even for a second), &quot;the Quidditch Cup should have had our
name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry joined the team, I&#39;ve
thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven&#39;t got it, and this year&#39;s
the last chance we&#39;ll get to finally see our name on the thing...&quot;

&#145;Sure it&#39;s not going to be just your and Harry&#39;s name on it?&#39; Alicia
thought to herself, almost sighing as she leaned back, hands
automatically rubbing to keep herself warm.

* * * * * *

At that the team started training three evenings a week.

The weather only got worst. It got colder and colder, and wetter and
wetter, with the evenings growing darker and darker... and yet that didn&#39;t
stop them from training three days a week, even if it killed Alicia
(which it didn&#39;t). While the mud, wind, or rain didn&#39;t diminish some of
their dreams of the cup, Alicia didn&#39;t seem particularly hot on it
despite the fact she was giving her 100% every practice.

And so Alicia returned to the Common Room one night wasted, eyes abit
bleary as she stumbled in only to find everyone up and excited over
something. Barely falling into the couch near the two fireside chairs now
occupied by Ron and Hermione (nearly missing Harry as she did), Alicia
flopped over the side of the couch and muttered &quot;What&#39;s up...&quot;

&quot;&quot;First Hogsmeade weekend coming up,&quot; Ron said excitedly, trying to copy
Hermione&#39;s Astronomy chart whenever she turned her back to talk to Harry
(only to get his hand smacked everytime he tried). &quot;End of October.
Halloween.&quot;

&quot;Excellent,&quot; Fred said as he filed in seconds after Alicia, &quot;I need to
visit Zonko&#39;s. I&#39;m nearly out of Stink Pellets.&quot;

&quot;You stink enough on your own.&quot; Alicia muttered, feeling the depression
only growing at the announcement. So it had finally come, the trip to
Hogsmeade, wonderous. She couldn&#39;t get her paper signed and had dreaded
this moment that was to come... and now it has come. That means Hemione
would be able to go, which means she would FINALLY get out of study mode...
which Alicia couldn&#39;t exploit since she couldn&#39;t go with her... talk about
a disappointing turn of events!

Hermione, misreading Alicia&#39;s glum features, said &quot;Alicia, I&#39;m sure
you&#39;ll be able to go next time.&quot;

Talk about being the queen of wishful thinking... waitaminute!

&quot;I think I got an idea.&quot; Alicia muttered, eyes glittering abit as a
thought occurred to her. A nasty wonderful brilliant little thought.

Suddenly, before Hermione could inquire, Crookshank appeared and leaped
on her lap, a dead spider dangling from it&#39;s weird little mouth. That was
gross.

&quot;Does he have to eat that in front of us?&quot; Ron muttered, scowling.

&quot;Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?&quot; said Hermione,
almost cooing over the gigantic furball sitting on her lap. &quot;I&#39;m going to
throw up all over it&#39;s fur.&quot; Alicia muttered, closing her eyes tight.

As if to end the night Ron did the taboo thing of offering to allow Harry
and Alicia to copy his already partially copied star chart, and then the
fuss he kicked up when Crookshanks tried to add Scabbers to the menu as
an after dinner snack... spider and rat, not yummy.

Obviously Alicia didn&#39;t have much of an appetite for chocolate after
watching that.

* * * * * *

It was bad enough that Ron and Hermione seperated on a bad mood last
night.

Ron, true to form, clung onto his bad mood as he would a prized Quidditch
collectible when the sun rose on a brand new day, chosing to wallow in
his own bitterness rather than even try to get over last night.

The bitter little pill was a pain during Herbology, which was a pain
since he, Hermione and Harry were working together to take care of the
same Puffapod. Alicia fared no better since she got stuck with Quidditch
teammates Angelina and Katie as partners.

Angelina sighed a near breathless giggle, her finger deftly tickling the
top of Katie&#39;s hand as they slowly worked on pulling the stripped fat
pink pods from the puffapods. Katie smirked and returned the motion,
alternating between playing finger tag and pulling pods. Alicia, the very
visage of annoyance, pulled her pods mindlessly as she worked. &quot;Can you
at least wait until lunch before you two make out?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not making out.&quot; Angelina muttered, her goofy grin never leaving
her face once.

&quot;Careful, Weasley, careful!&quot; Professor Sprout cried from behind, nearly
causing Alicia to spill her beans onto the floor (adding to the mess
already caused by Ron). &quot;...I need my very own sexfriend.&quot;

The rest of the class was spent in moody silence, stuck with watching her
teammates make goggily eyes.

&quot;P.S.&quot; Alicia muttered, &quot;My practice Quaffle isn&#39;t your sexaide, please
stop tribading with it...&quot; (silence) &quot;...at least pay me rent for it
everytime you mount it dammit... or make me a home vid sphere for private
use... something.&quot;

Transfiguration was boring, especially since Alicia&#39;s plan had nothing to
do with Professor McGonagall.

She waited for Potions, because her plan was to go straight to Snape and
get him to do the deed for her.

A good idea, especially since she had sufficent &quot;pull&quot; to get him to
bend... didn&#39;t she?

The moment she had a free chance to grab him she did just that. She
quickly went straight to Snape, jumping into his free chair as she looked
at him intently. &quot;I need you to forge me a permission form.&quot;

Snape, barely looking up from his work, narrowed his eyes abit at the
thought. &quot;I didn&#39;t think you were so hot and bothered to go to a place
like Hogsmeade.&quot;

&quot;What can I say, my love life is dead (you know THAT situation all too
well don&#145;t you).&quot; she answered honestly, &quot;Gimme a break.&quot;

His pen began scratching on the parchment he had before him, slowly
writing on it as he barely glanced up at Alicia, &quot;I&#39;m afraid not,
Spinnet. Maybe you should have spent more time &quot;buttering&quot; up the head of
your own house if you were planning on using your &quot;charms&quot; to gain
favors, because I can&#39;t help you since you are not of my own house.&quot;

&quot;Never stopped you before from meddling in the affairs of other houses.&quot;
Alicia shot halfheartedly, trying to widdle away at his iron clad
defense, realizing immediately that she really wasn&#39;t as interested in
Hogsmeade as in just finding time to get close to Hermione.

&quot;The form clearly states that only a parent or a guardian may give
permission, and I am most certainly neither of those.&quot; Snape remarked
coldly, continuing to write as he spoke. &quot;But leaving the castle should
be no real problem for you. All you have to do, after all, is have your
Dementor friends cover your retreat.&quot;

&quot;Which leaves me screwed when I get back though.&quot; Alicia countered.

&quot;Ah...&quot; Snape hissed in a rather unpleasant way, &quot;...my point exactly.&quot;

She hated it when he was so damn smug. Though, for once, she conceited
that he had a reason to be so.

She sucked sinking this low even if it was for her waning love life.

* * * * * *

And that, as they say, was that.

Deciding to call it a failure, Alicia conceited that she wouldn&#39;t be
going to Hogsmeade this year and thought it was (after all) for the best.
&quot;Not like I can&#39;t go to London if I really really need something.&quot; she
noted, which she (in fact) could (secretly of course). &quot;So I&#39;m not
exactly missing out.&quot;

Ron, however, didn&#39;t take the news of Harry&#39;s failing so well. In fact he
kind of lost it.

He began to call Professor McGonagall everything under the sun and stars
that he could think of, and when pressed to &quot;duty&quot; it seemed that he was
capable of thinking of quite a few unpleasant things to say (half of
which met with great displeasure from Hermione).

Hermione, in her even toned way, assumed that this was all &quot;for the best&quot;
which, well, really didn&#39;t do anything to cheer up either Harry or Alicia
in the slightest bit.

Ron, as expected, got only angrier at Hermione&#39;s easy going attitude... all
the while Harry &amp; Alicia had to endure the endless rattling on from
classmates about their well-laid plans for Hogsmeade weekend.

&quot;The best laid plans of overplanning people.&quot; Alicia sighed, not caring
anymore to count the amount of people who were going to go into a sugar
induced coma while in Hogsmeade as compared to the people who were going
to try and &quot;score&quot; while away from school.

&quot;There&#39;s always the feast,&quot; Ron said cheerily, trying to muster his own
level of even going attitude in light of the dim chance of McGonagall
changing her mind about Harry (or Alicia though he labored in
misconception about Alicia asking her in the first place). &quot;You know, the
Halloween feast, in the evening.&quot;

&quot;Thank you ever so you great glowing sun of conformity.&quot; Alicia muttered,
staring blankly at Ron. &quot;I think I liked you better when you were ranting
like a lunatic.&quot;

&#145;Face it.&#39; Alicia thought as she leaned back in her seat, &#145;I have about
as much interest in Hogsmeade as I do in working at the local SpellMart
as a greeter.&#39; (bleah) &#145;I just want to be near Hermione the moment she
snaps out of her study fixation and becomes normal again... if such a thing
was inhumanly possible.&#39;

Dean Thomas, who was good with quill and hand, offered to forge Uncle
Vernon&#39;s name and the name of Alicia&#39;s parents, but it was way too late
for that by now... pity he didn&#39;t offer that a month ago.

Ron tried to suggest the invisibility cloak only to be reminded about the
Dem-- suddenly Ron jumped at Alicia and tried to make her &quot;escort&quot; Harry
through the Dementors only for her to shoot it down right off. &quot;They&#39;re
hot on Potter for some ungodly reason.&quot; she noted with a slight bit of
irritation in her voice, &quot;They&#39;ll be drawn to him like flies to liquid
sugar! We wouldn&#39;t get five feet outside of the school before they rush
him, which would end in a failing firefight running battle right back to
the school in defeat!&quot;

Percy, bless his evil soul, had the worst thing to say to them when he
said &quot;They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you two that it&#39;s
not all it&#39;s cracked up be...&quot; (then he stopped) &quot;...alright, there is the
sweetshop which is rather spot on good, then there&#39;s Zonko&#39;s Joke Shop
(which I introduced Fred &amp; George too no matter what they say), and yes,
the Shrieking Shack&#39;s always worth a visit, but--&quot;

Alicia clamps her hand onto Percy&#39;s mouth to silence him.

&quot;Please stop. We can&#39;t take anymore good cheer and positive commentary
from you.&quot;

* * * * * *

Finally the day came. Halloween day.

On Halloween morning Alicia slowly dragged herself out of bed, abit worst
for wear all things considered.

&#145;Well,&#39; she silently mused, &#145;It&#39;s not like I have any reason to wake up
early today.&#39;

So, with that she decided to stay in bed (after going down for food and
packing enough in one of her tesseract jewels to keep to the room all
day).

Hermione made a promise to deliver sweets to her and Harry, which kind of
cheered her up... though not really since she was only beginning to thaw
from her relentless bookworminess, with the full meltdown happening out
of her range. Bummer.

She didn&#39;t accompany them to the entrance, but eventually she did leave
the girl&#39;s quarters to wander the school if only to stretch her legs from
her longer than normal bedstay. It was during this wandering that she ran
into Flitch abruptly, who regarded her with a strange expression. He
didn&#39;t say a word, but he seemed to have something on the tip of his
tongue that he wouldn&#39;t... or couldn&#39;t... spit out.

&quot;Whatever.&quot; she sighed in resentment, waving him off as she walked off.
&quot;Life sucks for us misfit humans.&quot;

So intent on getting away from Flitch, she wandered aimlessly until he
walked right into the opening door of the last person she wanted to see
at that moment... Lupin. Shocked, he nearly stumbled out of the doorway
towards the now stunned Alicia, who took the door full on in her face and
was now on her butt looking about in a confused manner. &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t
see you there. What are you doing here?&quot; he asked, genuine concern in his
voice, &quot;Where are Ron &amp; Hermione?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you want to know where Harry is?&quot; she asked, to which he said
&quot;Harry told me they went to Hogsmeade.&quot;

&quot;If you knew that already...&quot; Alicia hissed in response, &quot;...don&#39;t ask me
what you already know.&quot;

And, with that, she pulled herself to her feet as Lupin looked on, &quot;I was
only trying to...uh...&quot; (slight sigh) &quot;How about a drink? I just got a
grindylow for our next lesson, maybe you&#39;d like to see it.&quot;

&#145;Maybe it&#39;d like to see me more like it.&#39; Alicia pondered silently, but
relented to being taken in.

As she followed Lupin into the office she noticed the gigantic water
tank, and the sickly green creature staring at her from inside the tank.
The creature, with sharp little horns, had it&#39;s face pressed tightly
against the glass of the tank, making faces and flexing it&#39;s long long
fingers... until Alicia bolted forward and nearly slammed her face into the
tank, giving the creature a dreadful fright and sending it flying into
the weeds in the corner of the tank.

&quot;Uh... that might be a water demon, but you don&#39;t need to give it a heart
attack.&quot; Lupin remarked, motioning towards the tank as he passed Alicia.
&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t have much difficulty with him, not after tha kap--&quot;
(Alicia&#39;s face turns ashen) &quot;--oh, right, the amorous Kappa. Uh... anyway
--&quot; (cough cough) &quot;-- the trick is to break it&#39;s grip, it&#39;s fingers is
very long but also very brittle... see?&quot; (motions to his hands now filled)
&quot;Cup of tea?&quot;

&quot;No thanks.&quot; Alicia declined, &quot;I&#39;m set.&quot; she said as she pulled a bottle
of soda from a tessaract.

&quot;By the way, just out of curiousity...&quot; Lupin asked, fishing... &quot;About your
Boggart confrontation...&quot;

&quot;Fear of being alone.&quot; Alicia responded, getting a bit of a nod from
Lupin, who said no more on it.

An awkward silence filled the room between them as Lupin struggled to
find a common ground with the morbidly silent Spinnet. &quot;I better get
going.&quot; Alicia announced suddenly, standing up. As she did she noticed
the strange smoking potion on Lupin&#39;s desk, &quot;You&#39;re taking up liquid pot
smoking these days?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s from Severus... Professor Snape.&quot; Lupin answered, pulling another
long (distasteful) drink from the goblet as he spoke, &quot;I have never been
much of a potion brewer, and this one is particularly complex.&quot;

Alicia - &quot;Yeah, it must suck that the only person capable of making it is
the guy you treated like shit when you were both schoolmates, eh?&quot;

Lupin&#39;s eyes narrowed, his face froze, and not a word came from his lips.

&quot;Your silence speaks volumes.&quot; Alicia finished, walking out without
another word, leaving Lupin alone.

&quot;Apparently so.&quot;

* * * * * *

&quot;There you go!&quot; Ron cried out, shoving a giant goody bag into Alicia&#39;s
arms as she returned to the common room, nearly knocking her over as she
returned. Apparently they all returned while she was spending &quot;quality&quot;
time with Lupin in his office. &quot;We got as much as we could carry.&quot;

Alicia reached into her robes and pulled out a fistful of gold, giving it
over to Ron in turn, &quot;Thanks.&quot; (Hermione tried to make Ron return the
gold, but Alicia sternly refused to the point that Ron accepted happily...
if only not to get on Alicia&#39;s bad side as opposed to getting on
Hermione&#145;s bad side).

After that it was off to the verbal races as everyone told their tales as
quickly (and as loud) as they could. With everyone going on it was no
problem for Alicia to find a quiet spot in the room, sit down, and
quietly pursue her bag of goodies while casually listening to the others
talk. So much for warming Hermione up, as she was already going back to
her uber talkative focused self already.

Eventually it was time to head down to the meal, Alicia tagging along at
the rear of the line as they all headed down towards the Great Hall
(their small group growing larger as they picked up other groups of
students on their march to the Great Hall).

Once there Alicia&#39;s mood improved, especially once they began to eat.

Maybe it was the d&eacute;cor, what with the hundreds and hundreds of pumpkins
filled with burning candles (which somehow prompted Alicia to mumble the
lyrics to Disco Inferno for some odd reason).

Maybe it was the strange cloud of live bats (thoughts of Batman
occasionally poked into her mind).

Maybe it was the flaming orange streamers (thoughts of fire code
violations also poked into her mind should the flaming pumpkins and the
many streamers meet) which set the &quot;sky&quot; ablaze in color even as it was
cloaked in darkness as a storm raged about the castle even as they sat
down to eat.

But still, something about that night made the food just taste that much
better for some reason.

The food was delicious, the company was pleasant, and even those who
gorged on sweets from town managed to find room to eat... still, Alicia
pondered, she wondered if there would be enough bathrooms on campus to
handle several hundred chocolate overdosed hyperactive kids with bladder
problems... she thought it best not to ponder it any further than that one
inquiry, and to leave it to &quot;nature&quot; to sort out.

Professor Lupin looked his usual cheery self, a departure from his sudden
moody swing as they talked earlier in the day. He was having a lively
conversation with Professor Flitwick from Charms, who hopefully wasn&#39;t
one of his confidantes in teasing Snape when they were younger. &#145;Does the
headmaster ALWAYS like to put volitale teachers together in the same
school...&#39; Alicia thought briefly, pondering why these two former enemies
were put into this situation in the first place.

Snape, as par the course, was always glancing at Lupin. That didn&#39;t
surprise Alicia in the slightest, after all they had history so it&#39;s no
question that Snape still fostered lots of pent up aggrivation towards
him (and for good reason no doubt since she didn&#39;t know the details of
his past with Snape).

The feast came to an end with entertainment provided by the Hogwarts
ghosts, but that was all the entertainment Alicia was in the mood for as
she silently sneaked out without a word to anyone.

On the walk up to Gryffindor Tower she had time to ponder what was going
on.

She was being slowly stalked by an Assassin Guilder for reasons only
he/it knew, which probably had to do with her ascension in power last
year after claiming herself a new amulet and Heart core to channel her
powers through.

She had these ghastly Dementor things who occasionally reported in to her
as if she was their den mother or leader or whatever, which didn&#39;t look
good for her seeing how the school&#39;s headmaster had a mad-on against the
whole Dementor thing.

And she had to complete the year while trying to salvage any attempt at a
romantic relationship with the intellectually burdened Hermione who
seemed to only loosen up in Hogsmeade (which did Alicia no good because
she couldn&#39;t access Hogsmeade because she couldn&#39;t get her paper signed)!

This was nothing but bad news for her.

It got worst when she approached the portrait of the Fat Lady and heard a
scream.

She went into a quick run right away, ignoring all common sense as she
ran right towards the sound of the scream without a second thought.
There, she was quickly confronted by a looming figure of a man, cutting
impliment in hand as he angrily slashed as the portrait trying to gain
entry. The painting was torn open, and the barrier beyond was
superficially damaged with the decorative wood broken apart and sticking
out like a sharp wooden barrier against intrusion (the solid spell
enhanced door itself standing fully intact from the assault).

As she stared at him something perculiar happened... she hesistated,
allowing him enough time to move first. He quickly turned, and charged at
her bringing her senses back into action. She dodged to one side, aiming
up to fire at him, but he was too quick. Grabbing her outstreched hands
he quickly swung her about, sending her flying into the damaged painting.

Her body was wracked with terrible sharp violating pain as she slammed
headlong into the barrier blocking the entryway into the tower, a loud
reverberating through her body as she hit with force into the
obstruction.

Her mind struggled to pull herself together as she felt him quickly rush
her. Blood must have been coming from her head as she felt a hot wetness,
but she was certain it also came from her body as well.

Did she get impaled with wood shards? It felt as if her body was wracked
with a terrible pain which was robing her of her senses, and perhaps even
her life. A new scream filled her pained ears, but this time it wasn&#39;t a
woman&#39;s... it was a man&#39;s, and it sounded as if he was panicked about
something.

But this was a minor thing to the all consuming pain that enveloped
Alicia&#39;s being. She struggled to stay awake, but the pain was too much
for her to bear, the warmth of her own blood seemingly coaxing her body
shutting down as every sense failed her. A few seconds passed, and then
her mind and body betrayed her, shutting down from the excruciating pain
that beat into her skull relentlessly. The last thing she remembers is
the figure on top of her, and being held in his arms as he wretched her
robes open.

Harry, Ron and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the
usual path to the Tower, being the tail end of a long chain of students,
but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the
Fat Lady they found it jammed with students.

&quot;Why isn&#39;t anyone going in?&quot; Ron asked, curiousity tinging his voice as
he strained to look over the traffic jam of people that piled up ahead of
them. Harry, also curious, peered over the heads in front of him, as of
to confirm with his own eyes that the portrait was indeed closed (which
it was).

Percy, pushing his way past, began to forge his way forward into the
group in abit of a huff, &quot;Let me through here, please,&quot; he called out,
pushing and shoving his way past, an air of self imposed &quot;importance&quot;
beaming from him as he made his way through, &quot;What&#39;s the holdup here? You
can&#39;t all have forgotten the password -- excuse me, I&#39;m Head Boy, excuse
me...&quot;

As he reached the front, however, silence reigned once again. Even his
demanding voice ceased once he came to the sight that everyone beheld at
the head of the line. Suddenly Percy screamed &quot;Somebody get Professor
Dumbledore, QUICKLY!!&quot;

Everyone&#39;s heads turned, as if waiting for the person behind them to do
the deed, but not one moved from their spot. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; somebody
(Ginny) asked as she joined Harry, Ron and Hermione.

Several long moments passed until somebody finally managed to get
Professor Dumbledore, his robes sweeping dramatically as a &quot;hole&quot; was
cleared into the crowd to allow him access. As everyone quickly moved to
either side of the corridor to allow him access, the trio of Harry, Ron
and Hermione moved forward to get a better look.

&quot;Oh, no!&quot; Hermione choked, tears welling up in her eyes as she looked
towards the painting.

The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed
viciously to the point that &quot;debris&quot; of the painting lied scattered
about. The decorative door covering was broken and shattered, with
several shards of it lying about the floor. But it was the floor that
drew the most attention. There, lying on top of her own robes, was Alicia
Spinnet. Her body was face down, legs spread and arms sprawled up as if
she was on all fours and fell over in a heap. Her back was scarred with
several large wounds (magically healing as they watched), with several
wooden fragment to one side stained in her blood.

Her breathing was slow, labored but slow. She was in no pain now it
seemed, and her wounds seemed to have been cared for as she was in no
immediate danger of dying. Still, the condition she was left in left
little to the imagination. Dumbledore quickly took her into his arms,
pulling her robes over her body as he held her tightly in his strong
grasp. His eyes somberly turned towards the approaching Professors
McGonagall, Lupin and Snape as they hurried towards him. Snape, at first
stone face, went pale as he saw her in his arms.

&quot;We need to find the Fat Lady,&quot; Dumbledore said gravely. &quot;Professor
McGonagall, please go to Mr. Flich at once and tell him to search every
painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.&quot;

&quot;A wasted effort.&quot; a dark grim voice called out. All heads quickly looked
towards the end of the corridor to notice that they were being watched by
a reptilian thing with shiny metal technology grafted to it&#39;s head and
spine. It stared at them with it&#39;s emotionless face, silence reigning as
they watched him... until a burst of robes whirled past Harry, Ron and
Hermione with a yell of &quot;KILL IT!!&quot;

Spell shots rang out, hitting the reptilian dead on, only to cause it no
damage. It flickered, showing a glowing sphere within the translucent
&quot;form&quot; of the creature. &quot;If you are quite done...&quot;

Dumbledore grabbed ahold of Snape, pulling him back as the Galerian
watched them. Several students, who pulled their wands at the cry of
&quot;KILL IT&quot; slowly put their wands back, looking awkward.

&quot;With all of you spell throwers I had to adjust my tactics in an
environment like this. This holo-drone usit is now protected against
energy attacks -- it&#39;s only weakness being a pure all out physical
assault on the &quot;heart&quot; which, I am assure you, none of you are capable of
delivering. Now, if we are done flinging power shots about... you are
looking for the amply built fascimile woman known rather non P.C. as The
Fat Lady, I take it.&quot;

Silence. He knew they were all paying attention to him, and he was
carefully and skillfully working the crowd to his advantage. &quot;She is
abit... distressed. She doesn&#39;t want to be seen, oh no, she&#39;s in quite a
bit of a mess she is. Last I saw of her she was running through the
landscapes on the fourth floor of this complex, dodging between the
fascimile trees as she did. She was...&quot; (it spreads it&#39;s claws outwards
drawing his already rapt audience&#39;s attention tighter onto him) &quot;...crying
something fierce. Very emotional for a faux humanoid most certainly.&quot;

(No attempts by Ron to get Hermione to tell him what &quot;fascimile&quot; and
&quot;faux&quot; was seemed to work.)

&quot;Did she say who did it?&quot; Dumbledore asked quietly, his eyes boring down
solidly on the Galerian.

&quot;Oh yes, I did see that seeing how it was my drone unit who saw her just
minutes ago, while I myself witnessed the whole affair down here...&quot;
(motioning towards Alicia) &quot;...he did get quite angry when the Fat Lady
refused him entry, but I guess prison life made him hungry for the finer
things in life since he did take time after saving her to... &quot;save&quot; her.&quot;

The Galerian holo-image began to back away, towards the exit, never
looking away for an instance from it&#39;s audience. &quot;But I guess prison life
does that to people like Sirius Black... now, if you&#39;ll...&quot;

It said no more. A large hand grabbed it, and crushed the protective
shell shield about the holosphere shattering it in his hand. Hagrid,
brushing the metallic remains from his hand, looked at the crowd with a
bit of a frown marring his usually jovial features. &quot;Guess being all
muscles have it&#39;s advantages now and again, eh?&quot;</pre>
