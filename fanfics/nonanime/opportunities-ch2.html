Katrina Van Horn calmly ripped a piece of the cell
floor up, the redhead crushing the material into a
ball with her immense strength. Then she flicked it
towards the energy barrier that sealed her away,
watching as the force screen rippled under the impact,
studying how it reacted to the blow and filing away
the data for later.

&quot;Amazon, cut it out,&quot; the guard called irritably from
where he sat in the hall, his green armored uniform
bulking him up considerably. The half helmet hid his
eyes and hair, but the shape of his mouth showed his
irritation.

&quot;Just keeping busy,&quot; Katrina replied calmly, her brown
eyes amused as she sat back in her mostly bare cell.

He straightened up in his chair, &quot;Find something else
to do.&quot; His voice dropped dangerously, &quot;I&#39;d hate to
have to taser you again.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to see you try it,&quot; Katrina sneered at him
as she pointed out, &quot;you just got lucky the first
time.&quot;

&quot;Why you...&quot; he started to get up.

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing, officer?&quot; the voice
asked mildly as he walked into view. Simon Williams,
the hero known as Wonder Man, strode down the corridor
in black and red, the black haired man&#39;s eyes glowing
with unearthly energies.

&quot;Sir,&quot; the officer stiffened.

&quot;If you went in a cell with her,&quot; Simon said dryly,
&quot;she would have overpowered you, took your keys and
scooted. You should know better than that.&quot;

&quot;Spoil sport,&quot; Katrina sighed.

Simon walked in front of her cage, studying her
silently a moment. &quot;It could be so much easier for
you,&quot; he finally said, &quot;as a former member of the
Thunderbolts they&#39;d let you go once you agreed to
register.&quot;

&quot;I bet the Germans said the same things to the Jews
right before they branded them,&quot; Katrina answered
dryly.

&quot;It&#39;s not the same...&quot; Simon started.

&quot;No,&quot; Katrina agreed, &quot;with Stark in charge maybe not.
But what happens after he&#39;s gone, hmm?&quot; She sneered,
&quot;Do you really trust having your name and the names of
your friends held in government hands?&quot;

&quot;I trust Tony,&quot; Simon answered flatly.

&quot;Well good for you,&quot; Katrina laughed, &quot;that and a
buck&#39;ll get you a cup of coffee.&quot;

Simon turned, his back visibly stiff. &quot;Don&#39;t let her
get to you,&#39; he pointedly instructed the guard,
&quot;you&#39;ll regret it.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; the man saluted as Simon strode away.

&quot;Have fun selling out your own kind,&quot; Katrina called
before he was out of sight, glad for the chance to
stick another needle into him.

Time passed damn slowly in the calls, the artificial
lighting the only way to tell if it was day or night.
Calmly the one guard left and another went on shift,
settling into his spot at the desk across the hall,
monitoring the captives in this wing.

Once again Katrina carefully dug out material from the
floor, compressing it in her fingers into a small, yet
heavy projectile. &#39;Now,&#39; she mused, &#39;let&#39;s see if all
my practice will actually pay off.&#39; Raising her voice
she called, &quot;Guard!&quot;

&quot;Now what?&quot; the young woman asked, striding over to
the cell, seemingly safe on the other side of the
force field.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Katrina said as she flicked the pebble with
her superhuman strength.

The energy shield stopped the blow, but not before
warping outward and not incidentally striking the
badly off balance guard. There was a flash of energy
as the hapless woman was shocked, and Katrina seized
the moment to act. Pressing with all her might she
howled in pain as the weakened shield tried to stun
her, then in a flash of light she was through.

Clothes smoking and body aching Katrina forced herself
up, standing on legs barely able to hold her while she
tried to catch her breath. Bending down she grabbed
the guard&#39;s key-card, then looked around as she tried
to decide what to do next.

&quot;Shit,&quot; a voice from the next cell over called, &quot;let
us out!&quot;

Sweeping the room Katrina realized the corridor was
lined with cells, and all of them held superhuman&#39;s
being held captive by the government. Lady Deathstrike
was in one cell, the skull masked Taskmaster in
another, while other non-costumed figures waited in
others.

Debating only a moment Katrina used the card to open
the cells, releasing the men and women into the
hallway. &quot;Anyone remember how we got taken in here?&quot;
she demanded.

Lady Deathstrike smiled grimly, the mostly human
looking female cyborg pointing to the door at the end
of the hall, &quot;My internal systems say there.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s check it out,&quot; Katrina said boldly,
striding forward to unlock the door.

Outside another passage way stretched off into the
distance, and lights flashed red from where they were
mounted on the walls. &quot;Looks like they know we&#39;re
out,&quot; Taskmaster said grimly, &quot;wish I had my weapons.&quot;

&quot;If you want,&quot; Deathstrike purred, &quot;you can go look
for the weapon&#39;s locker.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Taskmaster sounded amused, &quot;I&#39;ll pass.&quot;

&quot;The guard has a billy club,&quot; Katrina noted, &quot;it&#39;s
something, at any rate.&quot;

&quot;Can you get us out of here?&quot; a blonde haired woman
asked nervously as she stood by Katrina.

&quot;I mean to try,&quot; Katrina said honestly. She looked the
girl over, &quot;Haven&#39;t seen you around. Did they just
bust you for having powers?&quot;

&quot;I call myself Fixer,&quot; she said with a nod, &quot;I can
heal people. A bunch of cape-killers brought be in
when I refused to join the Initiative&#39;s super-fascist
training ground.&quot;

Katrina fought back a chuckle, wondering how many
other people in this place were in a similar boat.
&quot;Come on,&quot; she swept the seven kids and two adults
with her eyes, &quot;let&#39;s see if we can get out of here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take point,:&quot; Deathstrike said as they hurried
down the corridor. The doors opened into a larger
chamber, one sadly occupied.

&quot;Open fire,&quot; the leader of the guards yelled.

Instinctively grabbing Fixer Katrine shoved her behind
her, yelping in pain as the first bolts burned her
skin. Even as they fired Taskmaster leapt into action,
copying a Daredevil attack and sending his borrowed
billy club bouncing amid their foes and knocking them
out.

Right behind him Deathstrike raced in, her fingers
extending into deadly blades as she chopped laser
weapons to ribbons. &quot;I&#39;d kill you,&quot; she said to one
terrified guard, &quot;but you&#39;re not worthy of my blades.&quot;

Grabbing a still conscious guard Katrina demanded,
&quot;Where&#39;s the way out?&quot;

&quot;That way,&quot; he pointed to the far door, &quot;but it won&#39;t
help you.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Katrina shook him.

&quot;You&#39;re in the Negative Zone prison,&quot; he gasped, &quot;even
if you open the gate, you&#39;ll have to fight your way
through a Initiative guard unit!&quot;

&quot;Oh lovely,&quot; Katrina knocked him out with a casual
blow to the head.

Fixer looked up at Katrina with fearful eyes, &quot;Is that
true? Are we stuck?&quot;

Katrina shrugged, &quot;Maybe.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; a young man with gleaming, chrome like
skin said, &quot;I intend to fight.&quot;

&quot;I ain&#39;t going back to my cell easily,&quot; Taskmaster
agreed.

&quot;Better to die on our feet,&quot; Deathstrike said calmly,
&quot;than live on our knees.&quot;

A young man stood up straight, &quot;I may have lost my
costume as Prodigy, but I will do my best to help.&quot;

Katrina faced her group of unlikely allies, &quot;Everybody
on board?&quot; When she heard a chorus of agreement from
the others she smiled slightly and said, &quot;Good,
because I think I may just have a plan.&quot;

&quot;Is it a good plan?&quot; a dusky skinned girl asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Katrina shrugged, &quot;but I figure it&#39;ll give us a
shot.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0

The Initiative base in Alaska was bustling as SHIELD
agents and superheroes guarded the Negative Zone
portal and defended the state from the forces of evil.
Of course, there wasn&#39;t much evil in Alaska, but
either way they were ready.

&quot;What did I do to deserve this?&quot; Patriot asked no one
in particular.

American Angel sighed, the blonde playing solitaire.
&quot;We drew states out of a hat,&quot; she noted, &quot;just our
luck we got stuck here.&quot;

Just then a warning chime rang out. &quot;Negative Zone
portal opening in five seconds,&quot; a SHIELD officer
called out.

&quot;Isn&#39;t it early for a guard rotation?&quot; Rocket Racer
asked as the gate shimmered open.

&quot;There&#39;s been a riot,&quot; a tall, female guard yelled as
she helped wounded guards through, &quot;the superhumans
are out of their cells!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Patriot leapt to his feet, bristling with
energy, &quot;We&#39;ve got to help!&quot;

&quot;But sir...,&quot; a SHIELD agent started.

&quot;Alaska Avengers, Assemble!&quot; Patriot yelled as he lead
his two comrades and most of the SHIELD agents through
the portal.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; one of the few remaining SHIELD
agents hurried over to help out the apparent leader.

With astonishing casualness the tall woman knocked him
out with one punch. &quot;Just fine,&quot; Katrina tossed the
helmet she had borrowed to disguise herself as a
guard, &quot;thanks for asking.&quot;

Taskmaster calmly smashed the portal controls, &quot;That
should buy us some time.&quot;

&quot;Who wants to play?&quot; Deathstrike extended her claws
and smiled at the few SHIELD agents trying to gather
their nerve to attack. In moments the men fled,
leaving them all alone in the base, for now.

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned, it actually worked,&quot; Katrina grinned
as they all headed outside, &quot;let&#39;s grab some vehicles
and get out of here.&quot; As they grabbed cars and other
craft she thought, &#39;This isn&#39;t over, of course. Stark
and his goons are still going to be after us.&#39; She
looked over as Fixer climbed in the cab beside her,
&#39;But at least we&#39;ll give &#39;em a run for their money.&#39;

End.

Notes: I really wanted to write a prison break, so
there ya go. American Angel and the girl Fixer are
original characters, everyone else is from Marvel comics.</pre>
