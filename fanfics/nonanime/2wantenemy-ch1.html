<h1>To Want One's Enemy</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>If there&#39;s one thing Cokie Mason is good at, it&#39;s getting under a person&#39;s skin. Every day I 
have to watch her hit on Logan and make snarky faces at me, and it&#39;s all I can do not to cry 
or want to punch her in her pointy little nose. I know Logan doesn&#39;t like her and never 
will, but it still bothers me.
 
Even worse is when her friend Grace Blume tries to corner me so Cokie can try to get some 
alone time with Logan, and she can get pretty physical about it, pushing me into walls and 
grabbing me. I was one grab away from going to the principal and reporting her for assault.
 
Until this morning.
 
It was just before homeroom, and Grace had me in a corner as usual while Cokie tried and 
failed to work her charms on Logan.
 
&quot;Let me go,&quot; I said.
 
&quot;No.&quot; She gave me a grin that reminded me of an evil Cheshire Cat. &quot;Mary Anne, could you be 
any more dense? You&#39;ll give your little artist friend a run for her money!&quot;
 
&quot;Leave Claud out of this,&quot; said angrily. &quot;Why are you always doing this? If I tell the 
principal you could get suspended for at least a week!&quot;
 
Grace seemed to panic for a minute, but not enough to let me go. Instead, she pressed her 
body up against mine...I didn&#39;t like the look in her eyes. She looked almost...lustful.
 
&quot;Don&#39;t you get it? If Cokie&#39;s busy bothering your boyfriend, she won&#39;t bother me!&quot; Grace 
said.
 
&quot;So...you just want to get away from her, then?&quot; I asked. It made sense, Cokie was a pretty 
terrible friend.
 
&quot;Not neccessarily,&quot; she purred, then did something that would make my head spin for the rest 
of the day: she kissed me. I didn&#39;t even have time to react before she pulled back.
 
&quot;See? I could give a damn less what Cokie&#39;s doing with Logan. I just want to get close to 
you.&quot;
 
She finally left me alone as Cokie dragged her away and Logan came to my side. I must have 
looked pretty shaken because he asked me what happened.
 
&quot;Nothing unusual,&quot; I lied. How could you tell your boyfriend another girl kissed you...and 
worse, that you might have liked it?
 
It was going to be a very long day.
