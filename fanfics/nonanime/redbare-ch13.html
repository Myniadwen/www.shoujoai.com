She was doing something when I found her. The girl. She was with the 
injured dog. It wasn&#39;t really a monster. It was just weird. The leg was 
broken and the fur stiff from dried blood. But it was alive. All of a 
sudden I felt better.

The girl stroked it. Patted it. Put a finger in its eye. I screamed. Put 
my arms around her and pulled her away. Tears. I cried. My tears in her 
hair. She shouldn&#39;t have done it. She didn&#39;t say anything.

The pitiful creature limped away. It moved in a strange way. There was 
blood all over it. How could it still be alive? I stopped sobbing. My 
tears were red. We needed to wash up.

Streets and mist and silence. The smell of blood would attract more 
dogs. Or those headless things. I shivered. Shivered and ran. The wind 
pressed against my face.

White and tall. I told myself it was just a building. Like the school. 
It was empty. Less threatening in a way. We went inside. Another lobby. 
More corridors. The girl&#39;s dad. I concentrated so that we wouldn&#39;t be 
seen.

We followed him. In a room. There was a man in there. He had killed a 
monster. They talked. The girl&#39;s dad and the man. Somehow I slipped. The 
man noticed me. He pointed his gun at me. Icy. It hurt. I fell. Lower. 
Deeper.

Into his arms. He caught me. Relief. Such relief. I wasn&#39;t hurt. The 
dress had stopped the bullet and he had saved me. Saved us. The girl was 
here too. It wasn&#39;t the same building.

He put me down and talked. Talked about lots of things. It all seemed 
simple. This time there wasn&#39;t any paint though. Crayons. Paper. He 
wouldn&#39;t let us have them. Pointed at our clothes. Told us we were no 
good painted red.

The last thing he showed us. Bathroom. It was some kind of house. There 
were windows. A garden outside. Nothing I remembered. Perhaps this 
wasn&#39;t a place I had dreamt about. He looked old. I hadn&#39;t realized 
until now. Like he had aged in seconds. Sick. Not well.

He waved goodbye and vanished. The girl and I went into the bathroom. 
There wasn&#39;t any washing machine. I probably couldn&#39;t use one anyway. 
There were showers in the bathroom. It could work.

I turned on the water. It had a perfect temperature. I stepped in. Let 
it wash off the red. Like magic. The water dissolved it. Cleaned it. 
Dragged it down the drain. It wasn&#39;t quite enough. There was still a bit 
that was stuck.

I took off my dress. Dropped it on the floor. The dress shirt too. The 
panties. And the socks and shoes. I wrung it and scrubbed it against the 
floor. It worked. The girl did the same. I helped her out of her 
clothes. Her bandage.

The shower. She turned it off. There was a bath tub. A strange bathroom. 
Neither sink nor toilet. Just the things we needed. I filled the marble 
bathtub. Foam. I couldn&#39;t see my reflection. The water was warmer. 
Warmer than the shower.

I hopped in. Hot. It hurt a little. But it was nice. It eased all the 
sore spots. My shoulders. My back. The girl got in too. It wasn&#39;t a very 
large tub. I could barely stretch my legs. My back pressed against the 
wall.

She sat down opposite to me. Resting her legs on mine. Her feet on my 
thighs. The heat made her moan. I smiled and rested my head on the edge. 
This was the relaxing. My thoughts drifted away from the stupid reality. 
This was healing water. Magic liquid.

Feet. Small. I took one and massaged it gently. She smiled. We had 
traveled for so long. Longer than I had ever run or walked. She was 
sore. I pressed my fingertips lightly against the sole of her foot. She 
closed her eyes.

I did the same to her other foot. Gently. Softly. To be tender. Kind. 
Kissed her ankle. She put her hands on the edge of the bathtub. Her 
palms were facing upwards. She was happy. I had kept her safe so far. I 
let go of her foot.

She slid forward. Stopped when her heels reached me. Snoring soundly. 
She was content. The water reached her mouth. When she leaned back a 
little she could breathe.

It reached my... It was so strange. When he had awoken me. When I was in 
the cabin so long ago. It was so different. I didn&#39;t look the same. I 
had slept for so long. Breasts. They were weird. The surface parted the 
left one in two. The lower part was sweating. The upper was cold.

They were soft. They swayed a bit when I ran. It was nice when she 
bumped into them. She did it a lot. I tried to lower them into the 
water. Her feet pressed harder against me. It was difficult. She wiggled 
her feet and it tickled.

I leaned my head back. Ignored the tickling. The marble tub was soft. My 
head rested tenderly. One of her feet slipped. Hit me right in the 
center. I moaned. She was still sleeping. I tried to adjust myself. It 
only made it worse. Even the slightest movement. I sighed. Tried to 
sleep. Enjoying it somehow. Marble. Softness.
