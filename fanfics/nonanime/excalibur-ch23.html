<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>Pete Wisdom strode down the hallway, the black haired
older man quietly complaining to Rachel the whole
time. &quot;Then Cecelia decides I haven&#39;t been poked and
prodded enough,&quot; he waved a hand, &quot;an&#39; tells me to
drop my pants!&quot;

&quot;Poor Pete,&quot; Rachel said, the redheaded young woman
looking visibly amused at hear about his various woes.

&quot;Your sympathy overwhelms me,&quot; Pete chuckled, the two
of them reaching the keypad for the detention block
beneath the island. He tapped in the proper sequence
of numbers and the heavy door groaned open, lights
coming on automatically.

&quot;If you hadn&#39;t farted around with keeping your
appointment for so long,&quot; Rachel pointed out to him
mercilessly, &quot;she probably would have just kept things
simple.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Pete conceded as the two of them
continued on to the cell that was holding their
involuntary guest.

The man called Bezerker looked up from his breakfast,
finishing off a bite of sausage and toast. Out of his
suit of mystical battle armor he looked a bit smaller,
his sandy brown hair falling boyishly into his eyes.
&quot;About time you got down here,&quot; he grumbled, taking a
swig out of his plastic cup of orange juice.

Pete gave him a look, &quot;I was unavoidably detained.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Bezerker growled.

Rachel hung back out of his line of sight, watching
the young man as she fired up her telepathic ability.
She wasn&#39;t there to scan his mind fully; instead Pete
wanted her to linger in the surface thoughts and try
to determine if Bezerker was really telling them the
truth. &#39;Easier said than done,&#39; she thought in
surprise, &#39;he&#39;s got pretty effective psionic shields.&#39;

&quot;So,&quot; Pete met his eyes coolly, &quot;what where you and
your friends doing at Endtech a few weeks back?&quot;

&quot;You already know that,&quot; Bezerker scoffed.

&quot;Let&#146;s say I&#39;d like to hear it from you,&quot; Pete said
calmly.

Bezerker looked to the ceiling with a sigh. &quot;I was
contracted by a lady named Codex to work with her
mercenaries,&quot; he said patiently, &quot;we hit the place
under the orders of somebody who called themselves the
Director.&quot;

Pete gave Rachel a look, the young lady shaking her
head no to indicate that he was lying. &quot;Of Weapon X, I
take it?&quot; he went along, referring to a semi-covert US
agency that was using mutant criminals as field
agents.

&quot;Yeah, for some reason or another they were interested
in genetic data on computer harddrives and organic
samples,&quot; Bezerker continued.

Rachel nodded slightly this time, indicating he was
being truthful. &quot;Who trained this guy,&#39; she wondered,
&#39;the last time I saw shields this good was when I was
working with Cable.&#39;

&quot;To build some king of enhanced soldiers,&quot; Pete said
flatly.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Bezerker nodded, &quot;or maybe to upgrade his own
people.&quot;

A short nod from Rachel confirming that, too.

&#39;Damn it,&#39; Pete thought, feeling more than a bit
annoyed at seeing his worse case scenario unfolding
before his very eyes. &quot;But Sinister double crossed
you,&quot; Pete chose his words carefully, &quot;he&#39;s using your
team&#39;s DNA without permission.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I...&quot; Bezerker blinked, suddenly realizing he&#39;d
been tricked into confirming his true employer and
yelled, &quot;Hey!&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t that hard to guess,&quot; Pete shrugged, &quot;and
the trail your hacker friend planted in Endtech&#39;s
systems was just a bit too blatant.&quot; Silently he
added, &#39;Not to mention we had Kate&#39;s future based
information.&#39;

&quot;If you know so much,&quot; Bezerker asked resentfully,
&quot;why are you here?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know,&quot; Pete said. He studied
Berzerker thoughtfully a moment, &quot;Where is Sinister
based?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he admitted. Bezerker smiled wryly,
&quot;The only one in the team who got face to face with
him was Codex.&quot;

Another nod from Rachel, and Pete noted she was
looking a bit stressed. &#39;These guys probably knew
they&#39;d be facing telepaths,&#39; he mused, &#39;he&#39;s got to
have some decent defenses.&#39; Looking back to Bezerker
he decided to end the interview then, &quot;The mainland
police want you turned over to them, if you&#39;ve got
anything more to say I&#39;d do it now.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Bezerker shook his head. As Pete was moving off
he asked, &quot;You know how powerful Sinister is, are you
still taking him on?&quot;

&quot;Someone&#39;s got to do it,&quot; was Pete&#39;s dry answer as he
opened up the door for Rachel and they both headed
out.

Bezerker waited a bit to make sure they were gone,
then seemingly talking to himself he asked, &quot;Did you
get all that?&quot;

&quot;Every word.&quot; He didn&#39;t really hear Codex&#39;s voice;
instead it vibrated in his bones from the transmitter
and receiver hidden in the back of his mouth. &quot;Not bad
at all,&quot; she calmly commented, &quot;Wisdom is sharper than
I thought.&quot;

&quot;That wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Bezerker quietly
admitted, &quot;he&#39;s been a British field operative for
years, after all.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a bit annoyed he caught on to the faked computer
data,&quot; Codex sounded irritable; &#39;&quot;I thought we did a
good job on that.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a pretty good hacker, boss, but that doesn&#39;t
mean that there aren&#39;t even better ones out there,&quot;
Bezerker pointed out. Changing the topic he asked her,
&quot;So what&#39;s the ETA for you guys busting me out of
here?&quot;

&quot;Change of plans,&quot; Codex started.

&quot;What?&quot; Bezerker sat up in surprise.

Continuing on as if he hadn&#39;t spoken Codex said,
&quot;We&#39;re going to wait until you&#39;re taken off the island
in police custody. It&#39;ll be easier than launching a
frontal assault against the sort of defenses that
island has.&quot;

&quot;Tough nut to crack?&quot; Bezerker asked.

&quot;They&#39;ve upgraded since the Brotherhood broke in,&quot;
Codex agreed, &quot;we could probably do it, but it&#39;d cost
us.&quot;

&quot;You almost sound like you&#39;re worried about your
teammates,&quot; Bezerker teased, curious to hear how she&#39;d
react.

There was a moment&#39;s pause then Codex said, &quot;I went to
a great deal of effort to form this team, it&#39;d be a
shame to waste it.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Bezerker said, knowing that was the
most he was going to get from her. He sat back on his
bunk with a muttered, &quot;Things were so much easier when
I was just an archeologist studying the Vikings.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Codex actually chuckled. A bit
more seriously, &quot;Good luck. This is Codex, signing
off.&quot;

Back in her apartment Diana Ramsey removed the
communications rig, the blonde smiling to herself
slightly. &quot;Does he know we&#39;re coming after him later?&quot;
Sienna Blaze asked, the orange-blonde haired
aristocrat lounging nearly naked on Diana&#39;s bed.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the equally unclothed Diana shrugged, getting
up from the desk and walking over to join the other
woman on top of the bed.

&quot;I still wish we could have sent Reaper,&quot; Sienna
purred as she drew Diana into her arms, &quot;then we could
just skip the rescue mission.&quot;

&quot;He knows how unpopular he is,&quot; Diana shrugged,
&quot;besides, he&#39;d have sung like a canary and told them
everything, not just what we want them to know.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Sienna kissed her gently. Softy she asked, &quot;Do
you really think we should double-cross Mr. Sinister?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s the one who betrayed us,&quot; Diana shrugged
uncomfortably, &#147;I&#39;m just interested in making sure he
doesn&#39;t get to enjoy it.&quot;

Sienna chuckled, &quot;That&#39;s my girl.&quot;</pre>
