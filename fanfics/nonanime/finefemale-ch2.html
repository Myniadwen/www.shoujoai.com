&quot;My adopted brother is going to be very amused by all this,&quot; Barbara 
Gordon admitted as the redhead opened the door to the roadster for her 
slightly taller companion.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Kara Lee asked as she took the seat, the blonde dressed casually 
but well.

&quot;He joked I should bring you home to dinner,&quot; Barbara said as the 
redhead took the wheel, &quot;but I bet he never expected me to actually do 
it.&quot;

&quot;Be careful what you wish for,&quot; Kara smiled wryly, &quot;you might get it?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Barbara said as they smoothly left the garage and took off 
down the snow covered street.

Kara relaxed as Barbara showed that she drove as well as she wrote crime 
novels. &quot;What&#39;s Bruce Wayne like?&quot; she asked.

&quot;A good man,&quot; Barbara answered her as she navigated through the thin 
winter traffic, &quot;and quite driven as a humanitarian. He feels his life 
was saved for a reason, and he wants it to mean something.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Kara nodded. &quot;How many cars do you have parked around Gotham?&quot; 
Kara wondered as they weaved around a few stalled out cars..

&quot;A few,&quot; Barbara admitted as they went over one of the bridges, away 
from the urban core and out towards the hills surrounding the city. &quot;On 
the surface it&#39;s a normal older model Mercedes,&quot; she revealed, &quot;but the 
interior is closer to my Batmobiles.&quot;

They smoothly traveled through the winding lanes as Barbara pointed out 
the sights, then they finally passed under the gate to Wayne Manor. The 
manor house itself had been in the family for generations, and was 
currently the property of Bruce Wayne. The Wayne family had adopted 
Barbara, but she had not chosen to change her last name in memory of her 
father, James Gordon, nor had she claimed a full share of the Wayne 
fortune. Instead she merely had a trust and the proceeds of her novels 
to support her.

Barbara pulled to the side of the house and into a underground garage, 
pulling up beside a small fleet of high priced cars. &quot;Are these yours?&quot; 
Kara had to ask, remembering with a chill some of Luthor&#39;s similar 
collections.

&quot;A few,&quot; Barbara conceded as she lead her towards the house, &quot;most of 
them are replicas owned by the family. Neither Bruce or I wanted to sell 
them off, as they belonged either to Thomas Wayne or Martha,&quot;

An older man stood in the doorway, his black hair streaked with grey. He 
had a dignified manner about him, magnified by his old fashioned suit, 
but there was also kindness in his eyes. &quot;Miss Barbara,&quot; he smiled, 
&quot;good to have you home so early tonight.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Alfred,&quot; Barbara smiled. She nodded to Kara, &quot;Alfred 
Pennyworth, I&#39;d like you to meet Kara Lee.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a honor, Miss Lee,&quot; Alfred bowed slightly.

&quot;The pleasure&#39;s all mine, sir,&quot; Kara smiled back warmly as she shook his 
hand.

&quot;Alfred is our chief cook and man Friday,&quot; Barbara told her with a wink 
as all three headed inside out of the cold, &quot;without him the mansion 
would grind to a halt.&quot;

&quot;Of course, madam,&quot; Alfred smiled slightly as he shut the doors. He 
looked at the two of them curiously, &quot;Will you be joining Master Bruce 
for dinner?&quot;

&quot;Does he have company?&quot; Barbara asked as they set off down the hallway 
past a empty suit of armor.

&quot;No, apparently none of his regular ladies would brave the snow,&quot; Alfred 
said in a deadpan voice, but a twinkle showed in his eyes.

&quot;I&#39;ve heard about his reputation for dating around,&quot; Kara addressed 
Barbara quietly, &quot;is it really deserved?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t take the gossip columns too seriously,&quot; Barbara laughed, &quot;Bruce 
dates, but he rarely takes them home with him. Or anywhere else, 
really.&quot;

&quot;Maintaining a playboy cover?&quot; Kara guessed.

Barbara nodded, &quot;As long as people think he&#39;s the playboy, they don&#39;t 
expect him to outmaneuver them in either the boardroom or in real life.&quot;

Opening up the door to the main diningroom Alfred announced, &quot;Barbara is 
here, and she&#39;s brought a guest.&quot;

Bruce Wayne looked up in surprise, then straightened up his half undone 
tie.. &quot;Ladies,&quot; he rose, bowing slightly, &quot;it&#39;s a pleasure to have you 
here.&quot;

Kara smiled slightly at that as Barbara preformed the introductions. 
&quot;And it&#39;s okay to talk about Batwoman,&quot; Barbara added as they took their 
seats, &quot;she knows.&quot;

Both Bruce and Alfred&#39;s eyes widened as Kara sat down, picking up a 
napkin and spreading it over her lap. She gave both men a whimsical 
smile as she explained, &quot;We&#39;re in the same line of work.&quot;

Bruce seemed to mull that over a moment, then his eyes widened a few 
moments before Alfred&#39;s did. &quot;Supergirl?&quot; Bruce asked quietly.

&quot;I prefer Kara,&quot; she answered, &quot;it&#39;s my real name.&quot;

There was a slightly different tone of awe in Alfred&#39;s voice as he 
repeated, &quot;It&#39;s a honor.&quot;

Deciding a topic change was in order Barbara asked, &quot;Do you need any 
help serving?&quot;

&quot;No, Miss,&quot; Alfred said with great dignity, &quot;I have it covered.&quot;

&quot;I have it covered?&quot; Bruce echoed quietly as Alfred left, &quot;Has he been 
watching too much TV lately?&quot;

&quot;I think he does it to throw you off,&quot; Barbara chuckled softly.

&quot;Possibly,&quot; Bruce admitted, &quot;but if he calls me his homeboy, steps need 
to be taken.&quot;

Kara hid a smile, quite entertained watching the two of them together. 
They reminded her of what she had seen of families, echoing faint 
memories of Krypton. It made her sad, wondering what it might have been 
like knowing her cousin, but she shook it off firmly.

Bruce looked at her curiously, &quot;So, any interesting gossip about the 
Justice Society?&quot;

&quot;Bruce!&quot; Barbara scolded him.

&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Bruce winked, &quot;you can&#39;t tell me you&#39;re not curious about 
Wonder Woman and her girlfriends.&quot;

Kara chuckled a bit uncomfortably, &quot;Girlfriend, actually.&quot;

&quot;Io, right?&quot; Barbara said thoughtfully.

&quot;How did you know?&quot; Bruce sounded surprised.

&quot;Oracle keeps a eye on embassy traffic,&quot; Kara guessed thoughtfully, &quot;and 
other than queen Hippolyta Io is the most frequent visitor.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Barbara chuckled softly, &quot;besides, a paparazzi got a photo of 
the two kissing.&quot; As both looked at her in surprise Barbara added, &quot;I 
paid him for the photo and not to publish it.&quot;

&quot;Not for blackmail, I hope,&quot; Bruce noted mildly.

&quot;No,&quot; Barbara answered after giving him a frown, &quot;I respect her too much 
for that.&quot; She paused before adding wryly, &quot;To be honest the 
photographer just really annoyed me.&quot;

Kara couldn&#39;t help but laugh as Alfred rolled in a cart carrying three 
plates. &quot;Hmm,&quot; Kara smiled, &quot;it smells wonderful.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, madam,&quot; Alfred smiled as he dished up turkey, stuffing, 
cranberries and potatoes for them all.

&quot;Excellent as usual,&quot; Barbara agreed.

As Alfred prepared to go Bruce added, &quot;You&#39;re welcome to stay here and 
eat with us.&quot;

&quot;No sir,&quot; Alfred shook his head, &quot;that would not be appropriate.&quot;

&quot;But Alfred,&quot; Barbara started.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Alfred bowed again, slightly, then he wheeled around and 
strode back into the kitchen.

&quot;He&#39;s so stubborn,&quot; Bruce sighed as he used a fork to cut into his 
turkey.

&quot;So are we,&quot; Barbara winked, &quot;we just have to out-stubborn him.&quot;

&quot;How long has this been going on?&quot; Kara asked as she began to neatly eat 
her food.

&quot;About,&quot; Bruce looked at Barbara, &quot;two years or so?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Barbara agreed, &quot;we started trying to get him to eat with 
us the Thanksgiving before last.&quot;

Kara chuckled as she drank some water. &quot;Well,&quot; she suggested, &quot;why not 
join him where he&#39;s having dinner?&quot;

Both Bruce and Barbara looked at her blankly for a moment. &quot;Why didn&#39;t I 
think of that?&quot; Bruce laughed, shaking his head.

Barbara looked them over, &quot;The kitchen table seats four....&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Bruce picked up his plate, leading them into the kitchen.

&quot;Eh,&quot; Alfred looked up from his meal in surprise as they sat down at the 
table, &quot;Master Bruce, Madam Barbara, you....&quot;

&quot;Mr Pennyworth,&quot; Kara smiled at him charmingly, &quot;the holidays are a time 
for family. And while I haven&#39;t seen too much of the three of you yet, 
it certainly seems that Bruce and Barbara consider you one of their 
family.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Barbara nodded, once again surprised at how quickly Kara could 
see a situation. &#39;She&#39;s not as naive as she once was,&#39; she mused.

&quot;Ditto,&quot; Bruce nodded. He smiled at Alfred, &quot;Now, we can keep switching 
rooms till dinner gets cold, or eat. Your choice.&quot;

Alfred reached up to brush a tear from his eye as he smiled, &quot;Very well, 
let&#39;s eat.&quot;
