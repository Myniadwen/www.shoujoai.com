slim brown haired woman tearing through all the
guardian creatures outside the sanctum. Dressed in a
simple brown and gold uniform she fought with a
ferocious grace, twin metallic claws extended from the
back of each hand.

&quot;Who!&quot; everyone looked at Rachel.

Rachel shook her head, short red hair falling into her
eyes as she said, &quot;Would you mind if I go outside, we
might want to stop her?&quot;

Illyanna raised her eyebrows but the blonde nodded,
&quot;Right.&quot; She looked at Kitty and smiled, &quot;We&#39;ll be
right back.&quot;

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Kitty cautioned as Illyanna summoned
another stepping disk then she and Rachel were gone in
a burst of light.

Outside the young woman kicked out gracefully, her
foot sweep dropping the one monster even as she
headbutted another with simple economy of movement. &quot;I
just want to know where Rachel Summers is,&quot; she said
coldly, claws gleaming as she braced for another
attack, &quot;is that so hard to understand?&quot;

&quot;Jane!&quot; Rachel called as she dropped to the ground
nearby, Illyanna right behind her.

With a dramatic mystic gesture and a softly chanted
word Illyanna sent the army of guardian beasts back to
where they came from even as she watched Rachel and
the mystery woman rush to each other, the young lady
enfolding Rachel in a firm hug. &#39;Well, I guess she&#39;s
not an enemy,&#39; Illyanna silently mused.

&quot;I&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Jane murmured to Rachel, pulling
back slightly to look up into the slightly taller
woman&#39;s eyes.

&quot;How did you get here?&quot; Rachel asked quietly, though
from the look on her face she probably already knew
the answer.

Before Jane could answer Illyanna gave them a wry
smile, &quot;We might want to take this inside.&quot; With a
thought she summoned stepping disks and whisked them
from the busy New York street to the inside of the
building where the others waited.

Kitty swept the newcomer with a glance, the brown
haired magician blinking as she blurted out, &quot;She
almost looks like Logan.&quot;

Jane smiled slightly, her brow hair swept back in a
oddly familiar style, her brown eyes oddly shy as she
said, &quot;That&#39;s my name, Jane Logan.&quot;

Phoenix smiled wryly as Jean gave the younger woman a
wry smile, &quot;I thought we left you safely in the
future.&quot;

Jane shook her head firmly, &quot;I wanted to make sure
Rachel was all right, so I petitioned Lady Katherine
and Illyanna to send me here.&quot;

&quot;Back up a minute,&quot; Illyanna jumped in, &quot;I take it
from what Phoenix and Rachel have said you&#39;re from
their era, but who are you?&quot;

Rachel took Jane&#39;s hand and gave it a comforting
squeeze as she said firmly, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Jane
Logan, she&#39;s a member of the New Mutants as Feral.&quot; A
pause, &quot;And she&#39;s also a clone of the X-Man
Wolverine.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; Jane nodded to them all, her
smile slightly amused at the oddness of the situation.

&quot;This sort of thing happens to you often?&quot; Alysande
Stuart murmured, the brown haired woman standing
beside Jean.

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised at how often,&quot; Jean answered with
a laugh.

&quot;Then I suppose I&#39;ll just have to get used to it,&quot;
Alysande murmured, tentatively slipping her fingers
into Jean&#39;s.

Jean smiled back, squeezing her fingers slightly.

&#39;Well isn&#39;t that interesting?&#39; Kitty noted with some
amusement. Turning back to the newcomer she smiled, &quot;I
can certainly see the resemblance.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised that you&#39;re not asking all of the
obvious questions,&quot; Jane said to Kitty with a faintly
curious smile.

&quot;I&#39;m tempted to, believe me,&quot; Kitty admitted, &quot;but I
suspect that we don&#39;t know enough about Logan in the
here and now to understand where you came from.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s very true,&quot; Rachel nodded, thinking back to
what she knew about the X-Men in this place and time.

&quot;So,&quot; Illyanna looked at Rachel and Jane standing so
close together, &quot;should we put you two together in one
room?&quot;

Jane actually blushed while Rachel grinned, &quot;You got
that right.&quot; She dropped her voice as she confided, &quot;I
may hang the &#39;Do not disturb&#39; sign on the bedroom door
early tonight and welcome Jane home the right way.&quot;

&quot;Ray!&quot; Jane blushed.

Kitty chuckled, feeling oddly amused to see a woman
who looked so much like Wolverine be so cutely shy.
Turning towards Alysande she smiled and boldly lied,
&quot;We&#39;re a little short on rooms, I&#39;m sorry to say.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Alysande raised an eyebrow, the older
Englishwoman looking at her thoughtfully.

&quot;Would you mind terribly sharing a room with Jean?&quot;
Kitty asked.

Alysande blushed faintly as she looked over at Jean
but her voice was steady as she said, &quot;No, I don&#39;t
think it&#39;ll be a problem.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Illyanna rubbed her hands together, &quot;Jean,
Rachel, why not help the newcomers unpack while Kitty
and I get started on dinner?&quot;

&quot;Nice,&quot; Kitty murmured as the two pairs walked away.
Together they headed over to the kitchen, smiling
slightly as they gave the ghost that haunted the
kitchen their food orders.

&quot;You, Pryde, are a hopeless matchmaker,&quot; Illyanna
scolded, taking an apple out of the fridge and
crunching into it. She chewed and swallowed, &quot;Just
because Jean and Alysande are all blushy doesn&#39;t mean
they&#39;re interested.&quot;


Kitty gave her a look.

&quot;All right, they&#39;re interested,&quot; Illyanna conceded.
She chuckled, &quot;But you really shouldn&#39;t be trying to
pair them up so quick.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not expecting them to tear each others clothes
off on the first night,&quot; Kitty said mildly, &quot;but this
will help them get there eventually.&quot;

&quot;It took us a while,&quot; Illyanna mused, &quot;even being
roommates.&quot;

&quot;I was pretty clueless,&quot; Kitty admitted as she leaned
over to plant a kiss on Illyanna&#39;s cheek. She smiled,
&quot;Hopefully Alysande is quicker on the uptake.&quot;

&quot;I kind of thought she&#39;d be the one trying to make
Jean see the light,&quot; Illyanna laughed as she snuck
another kiss.

&quot;Either way works,&quot; Kitty laughed.

Dinner was a success, and Kitty was encouraged to see
that the two pairs were still together. Rachel fed
selected tidbits to the blushing Jane while the two
looked into each others eyes. Over on the other side
Jean and Alysande were lost I conversation, gazing
happily into each others eyes.

They all tried to stay up as long as possible, but Jet
lag and a busy few days finally caught up with them.
Rachel and Jane had retired first, Rachel whispering
something in Jane&#39;s ear and making her blush, then
Jean and Alysande made a more dignified exit. Finally
Kitty and Illyanna settled into bed, nearly falling
asleep...

...when the mystical alarms went off.

Illyanna sat up in bed, tuffs of her blonde hair
standing up and expression murderous as she muttered,
&quot;I&#39;m going to kill &#39;em.&quot;

Cursing under her breath Kitty got up out of bed and
stalked over to the dresser, chanting a few words over
a basin of water to turn it into a scrying pool. She
looked at the image of the individual attacking the
mystical shields and blinked, &quot;Baron Mordo?&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Illyanna walked over to peer into the waters.

&quot;He was the Ancient One&#39;s apprentice beside Doctor
Strange,&quot; Kitty frowned, &quot;but I thought he reformed a
while back?&quot;

&quot;Guess not,&quot; Illyanna sighed.

&quot;Do you want to handle him or should I do it?&quot; Kitty
asked with a yawn, tiredly pulling a robe on over her
nightie.

&quot;Let&#39;s do it together,&quot; Illyanna grinned, summoning
her soulsword.

Kitty chuckled, &quot;Besides, I have some new spells I
want to try on him.&quot;

&quot;You would,&quot; Illyanna laughed as they headed off to do
battle... together.

The End

Notes: Kitty and Illyanna&#39;s battle with Baron Mordo
was in chapter #1, after which Kitty had a flashback
to how she and Illyanna got into using magic.
Therefore it seemed fitting to bring the series full
circle, more or less.

So why am I ending it now? Well, I originally just
planned this to be a silly x-over series, but a plot
idea kind of got out of hand... so once I resolved the
&quot;anti-phoenix&quot; thing it seemed like a good place to
close. Of course I may or may not do a one shot on
Rachel and Jane...

Let&#39;s see... Jane Logan is based on X-23, a new
character who was introduced in the X-Men comics
recently as well having her own mini-series. She
hasn&#39;t got an &quot;official&quot; name yet so I called her
Jane, a female version of Wolverine&#39;s first name,
James. Her origin tied in with Weapon-X, so since
Kitty and Illyanna are unaware of that in this place
and time, it makes sense that Jane couldn&#39;t easily
explain it all to them.</pre>
