&quot;You can&#39;t tell me the only thing you digest is tea,&quot; Terra said with 
light mirth, while an eyebrow rose to the sorceress&#39; order of herbal 
tea.  She had coaxed the sorceress finally in coming out with her, and 
though she had remained silent all the way to the small restaurant just 
passed Jump City&#39;s line, close to where the Titans had first found her.

&quot;Would you be surprised if I said yes?&quot;  Raven asked, while cupping her 
chin in her hands.  A silver spoon was wrapped in her black magic, which 
swirled around the contents of tea and sugar.

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Terra smiled, while leaning back against the booth, her 
eyes shifting toward the window on her right, and the view of the dirt 
and mountains behind it.  A forecast reflection was slightly visible 
through the clear glass, showing the occupants of the restaurant; from 
the mild manners patrons, to the truck driver sitting at the counter, 
the waitress taking his order, and the black and orange masked mercenary 
leaning against the glass on the other side of the counter.  Sapphire 
hues quickly widened in shock, turning her head fast enough to snap it 
straight off to where the man would have stood.

No one.  Her heart raced faster than she thought possible, the amount of 
fear Slade had placed in her enough to send her into shock if she had 
actually seen him there.  Slowly, her breathing calmed, focusing upon 
the staring sorceress, who merely blinked at her actions.

&quot;Everything alright?&quot;  Raven asked.  &quot;You look like you&#39;ve just seen a 
ghost.&quot;

&quot;Yea,&quot; Terra replied nervously.  &quot;Hey, let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;

Before the sorceress could reply, she grasped the girl&#39;s wrist tightly, 
pulling her up from her seat, and nearly dragging her out the front 
door.

&quot;I didn&#39;t finish my tea,&quot; the staggering dark magus replied halfway out 
the door.  &quot;And we didn&#39;t even pay!&quot;

The amusement park was abandoned, with no lights lit but the stars in 
the sky, shining down upon the darkened district.  Terra sat across from 
Raven inside the small booth of the Ferris wheel, the sorceress once 
again retaining her tongue since her initial dragging from the 
restaurant.  Terra let out a light sigh, hoping this night would have 
been better than this.

&quot;Raven?&quot;  Terra asked, her eyes focused upon the floorboards of the 
lifting booth.  Raven hadn&#39;t turned her vision from the side of the 
booth, her arm resting on the window&#39;s edge but let out a light &#39;hmm&#39; to 
know that she was indeed listening.  &quot;Can sins be forgiven?&quot;

&quot;Can sins be forgiven?&quot;  Raven thought deeply over the girl&#39;s question 
before relaying an answer.  &quot;I believe if one makes a mistake, upon 
realization of their mistake and in taking full responsibility of their 
mistake, the person is instantly forgiven.&quot;

It was true.  Raven truly was the wisest person she ever knew.  Was it 
that factor that attracted the blonde to the sorceress?  Or was it the 
fact that she loved the fact that the gothic princess would get jealous 
over Beast Boy&#39;s flirtatious attitude?  Terra truly didn&#39;t know, but she 
knew she loved being around the girl, morbid as she was.  Though the 
girl always hid her emotions and feelings from most, as well as Terra 
herself, she felt that she was lucky to see a side of Raven no one else 
was privileged to see ... sometimes ... on occasion.  Like the time she 
had spent with her on the roof of the tower.

&quot;Is it really that easy?&quot;  Terra asked, not lifting her eyes to view the 
sorceress, whose attention seemed locked upon the scene outside of their 
small booth.  Raven finally turned her gaze toward the girl, her brows 
pinching slightly together.

&quot;It always depends on the character,&quot; Raven said flatly.  &quot;Everyone&#39;s 
made mistakes.  The hardest part about it, however, is admitting you&#39;ve 
made the mistake, taking responsibility for it, and deciding what it is 
you&#39;re going to do about it.&quot;

Terra seemed to take deep thought in the girl&#39;s wise words, a slight 
twitch in her expression showing she truly understood what the sorceress 
had to say.

&quot;Anyone can say they&#39;ve made a mistake, Terra,&quot; Raven continued, while 
leaning in slightly.  Her arms rested on her knees while her back arched 
forward.  &quot;But when it comes down to it, it&#39;s a matter of action, not 
words that will give you the forgiveness you seek.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Raven,&quot; Terra finally replied, her eyes shifting up to the 
girl&#39;s dark purple eyes.  Raven nodded her head, leaning back against 
the chair of the cart, while it continued to take them up the circular 
structure.  &quot;Thanks for coming out with me tonight, too.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I would have gotten sleep in either case,&quot; Raven said 
dryly, back into her monotone attitude.  &quot;Plus ... it wasn&#39;t all that 
bad.&quot;

Terra knew the girl long enough to know the sounds of a compliment when 
it came.  She quickly smiled; though finally noticed where it was Raven 
had been looking this entire time.  Terra&#39;s eyes shifted skyward, to the 
crescent moon overhead, the clouds slowly moving to overtake the bright 
white sphere.

&quot;The moon looks beautiful tonight,&quot; Terra said lamely while kicking 
herself inwardly for attempting to ruin a perfectly good silent moment 
with her terrible communicational skills.  Even still, she couldn&#39;t help 
but be curious of the moon dragging away her sorceress&#39; attention.  
&quot;Does it remind you of something?&quot;

&quot;Home,&quot; Raven found her voice admitting before her brain even registered 
the thought.  Catching herself, she decided to continue with her words 
rather than suddenly burry her thoughts as well as her voice when they 
were supposed to be enjoying themselves.  &quot;I can&#39;t remember my home too 
much ... but every time I see the moon, it reminds me of when I was 
little.  I used to stare at it all the time from where I lived.  No 
matter how much around me has changed, no matter how much I&#39;ve changed, 
the view of the moon never does for me.&quot;  Silence fell over them once 
again.

&quot;Raven,&quot; Terra finally spoke after another full minute of silence.  
&quot;There&#39;s something I have to-&quot;

&quot;The past is behind you,&quot; Raven quickly stated as she averted her view 
of the moon.  Memories of her fallen home reminded her of the pained 
look that expressed over the blonde&#39;s features.  The girl no doubt had 
some sort of dilemma in the past that had something to do with her 
uncontrollable powers.  Raven had a good idea of just how heavy a burden 
consequence was.  &quot;The only way to live your life is to look forward.  
Live your life with absolutely no regrets.&quot;

&quot;No regrets,&quot; Terra repeated while her eyes remained focused forward, 
directly into Raven&#39;s own.  Her thoughts were shredded as she became 
fully lost in a pool of dark lavender, her lids lowering slightly while 
a utopia feeling settled at the pit of her stomach.  Her palms became 
sweaty while they gripped the seat she sat upon, her weight moving 
forward ever so slowly.  The sorceress hadn&#39;t budged since her short 
speech, which was beginning to feel like eons ago.  This was it.  If she 
wanted to make a move, now was the time.  She didn&#39;t know how the 
sorceress would react, but she herself had informed her that she should 
live life with absolutely no regrets.  Despite all logic in her brain, 
Terra leaned forward, reaching her right hand out to grasp the 
sorceress&#39; slim ashen tone digits.  Raven&#39;s eyes followed the girl&#39;s 
actions, widening slightly as they moved from the girl&#39;s hands to the 
intense gaze that followed, her lips parting to speak but no words 
flowed through.

&quot;Hello, Tara,&quot; came a deep voice to Terra&#39;s left gathering the attention 
of both occupants of the cart.  The dark silhouette moved into the cart 
with ease, the light shinning over a black and orange mask, with the 
single eye glaring toward the blonde.  The two stood immediately, with 
Raven instinctively moving in front of Terra, throwing her arms up in 
defense.  &quot;Remember me?&quot;

Raven sacrificed a second to look over her shoulder to the fearful 
Terra, only seeing her as fearful once before.  The sorceress turned 
back to Slade, her eyes lowering in hate, but quickly attempted to 
control her emotions and pivoted her boots to get a good grip on the 
flooring for quick action if the man lashed out at them.

&quot;I have plans for you, Tara,&quot; Slade stated firmly, shifting his one eye 
from Raven back to the blonde.  &quot;Did you think you and your little 
girlfriend could just run away?&quot;

Slade made a reach for the girl but Raven was faster with her movements, 
fully prepared for the mercenary&#39;s attack.  Her palm rejected his touch 
at the wrist, and her other hand shout outward, her palm smacking into 
his chest with a black energy expulsion to follow.  The force was enough 
to send the mercenary back toward the door he had jumped through, 
shaking the cart the three stood in.

&quot;You&#39;re not going to touch her!  Az&#39;rath, Metrion, Xinthos!&quot;  Raven 
cried out as her eyes flash black, extending her arm outward as a black 
spiral energy beam began to sprout.  A claw of black energy smashed into 
the mercenary and completely shattered the side of the cart.  Slade was 
strong, however, and with a quick shout his arms broke free of the 
prison and landed safely on the roof of the next card, standing as 
confident and cocky as he always did.  Raven glared hatefully down to 
the man, not looking back to the blonde as she called back to her.

&quot;Terra!  Run!&quot;  She quickly commanded while she leaped from the cart 
down to the roof of the next, following in the mercenary&#39;s footsteps.  
She noticed Slade&#39;s eyes travel back to the blonde elementalist, 
shouting out his own command over Raven&#39;s.

&quot;Stay where you are, child,&quot; he shouted, then returned his glare toward 
the sorceress.  Raven looked from Slade to Terra, who stood clenched to 
the side of the shredded cart, with a look of pure fear toward the man.

&quot;What do you want with her?&quot;  Raven demanded to know, swinging her arm 
out from behind her cloak.  The man regarded the sorceress with a look 
of surprise, his voice as calm as ever.

&quot;You mean,&quot; he started as his eyes trailed back to the blonde.  &quot;She 
didn&#39;t tell you?  I thought you two were friends.&quot;

Raven was caught off guard by Slade&#39;s words, and received the back end 
of his metal staff to her stomach, the force well more than enough to 
send her body far over the edge of the roof.  Quickly gathering her 
emotions, her powers forced her afloat, and quickly hurled herself 
skyward, a few yards out of Slade&#39;s reach.

&quot;Az&#39;rath, Metrion, Xinthos!&quot;  Raven chanted out while her eyes grew 
black once again.  The support beams that held the cart Slade stood upon 
became engulfed in Raven&#39;s magic and suddenly imploded.  Metal shards 
erupted and the cart suddenly teetered outward with a loud cry of metal 
grinding against metal.  Slade leaped from the cart to the roof of the 
one Terra stood upon, and Raven quickly flew up higher, just as the cart 
below it crashed to the ground.  With a twirl of his staff, Slade 
reached behind his belt and threw his arm outward, with a wire shooting 
out to the flying sorceress, wrapping around her neck before she could 
even process a thought.  With a rough tug, he brought the girl down to 
his level, crashing down onto the roof of the cart, shaking it even more 
so.

Slade ran forward, winding his leg back and throwing a devastating kick 
to the girl&#39;s midsection while she was down.  Raven was fast enough to 
raise her arms, catching most of the blow to her forearms.  The force 
was enough to send her upward again, and her arms were thrown to her 
side, her magic instantly catching her into flight once again.  Slade 
glared at the girl while she levitated above him, lowering his stance 
while he prepared for another attack.  Terra&#39;s head was peeked over the 
window, looking up to view the sorceress.  Raven took a moment to glance 
down at the girl and was suddenly tackled by Slade, who had leaped from 
his crouched stance.  While they fell, Slade moved apart and extended 
his legs to the girl&#39;s midsection, sending her falling at a faster rate 
while he pushed off the girl and back-flipped onto a metal girder that 
held the structure together.

&quot;You think you know her,&quot; Slade called out to the sorceress as she began 
to drag herself up from the dirt pile she had landed in.  Raven 
defiantly stared down the mercenary, forcing herself to a stand and 
quickly taking flight, the two weaving from rooftop to rooftop, along 
the sign and all throughout the Big Wheel.  &quot;You know nothing!&quot;

Another near miss as Raven&#39;s extended arm nearly decked off Slade&#39;s 
head, the black-attired man having leaped off the rooftop of another 
cart, landing safely onto the next rising one.  Raven quickly followed 
suit, her speed nearly doubling in an instant.  The small girl wound up 
her long well toned leg and swung at his head.  Slade crouched under the 
kick and quickly brought his arm up to block the back end of her other 
leg, the girl&#39;s body twisting in mid air to deliver a spinning back 
kick.  The mercenary grasped the girl&#39;s ankle and turned his body, 
slamming her back first onto the floor, leaving an indent where she 
landed.  He pinned the girl with a foot on her chest, pressing all his 
weight down while he leaned over, glaring an equal expression of hate.

&quot;She never even liked you,&quot; his voice called out low enough for the 
sorceress to hear.  Raven&#39;s eyes flared black, while she gripped the 
man&#39;s boot, struggling against his weight.  With a mighty cry, a black 
aura exploded around her, completely shredding the cart they stood upon 
to pieces and sending the mercenary flying outward.  Catching his 
balance in mid flight, he arched his form about and redirected himself 
to land on the moving metal girder of the wheel.  Raven&#39;s form levitated 
while pieces of the cart fell to the ground, breathing heavily while she 
attempted to regain some energy.

&quot;Raven, come on!&quot;

Raven turned to view the blonde much higher up than herself, standing on 
a piece of uplifted Earth, her hand extended in her direction.  Her 
expression revealed just how much of a strain the night had turned out 
for her, and Raven simply glared back to the man that had ruined their 
perfect night.

&quot;Not so fast!&quot;  Slade screamed as he threw his arm out with another wire 
shooting toward the sorceress.  This one wrapped around her ankle and 
instantly tightened.  With a quick maneuver, Slade jumped back, using 
the edge of the girder to his advantage.  His weight pulled the 
sorceress to where he once stood, smashing her stomach into the metal 
support beam.  Using the same momentum, Slade swung himself right back 
to where he was, grabbing a handful of dark violet strands and pulling 
her up.  Blood dripped from her lips while her eyes became glazed over.  
He threw the girl to a side support beam and quickly followed up with a 
thrust punch to her chest, knocking the wind from her lungs.  Slade 
brought both hands up to crush the girl&#39;s skull in, his fingers 
interlocking together as they rose far above his head.  A baseball sized 
rock suddenly smashed into the side of his head, nearly knocking him 
right off the support beam.  Another rock attempted to take his head 
off, which he easily swatted to pieces, turning to face the blonde 
haired elementalist staring intently at him.

&quot;Raven!  Fly!&quot;  Terra quickly shouted while her eyes flashed yellow.  
Partially out of it, the sorceress flung her body to the right, 
gathering her magic and forcing herself to take flight.  Slade swung his 
head to his target then daringly back to the young blonde just as her 
arms rose together.

&quot;Terra!  No!&quot;  Slade&#39;s order threw a bit of fear into her, but she 
didn&#39;t falter in the least as the supports began to buckle.  In an 
instant the Earth beneath the large structure shook and down it came, 
lifting first then completely falling apart, with Slade falling into the 
large dust cloud that followed.  Raven&#39;s magic had only taken her so far 
before she levitated herself to the ground, holding her chest as her 
lungs forced up a portion of blood.  She covered her mouth as she 
continued to cough, the dust simply irritating her lungs further.  A 
slim arm wrapped around her midsection while her own was thrown over the 
blonde&#39;s neck, Terra quickly rushing the two away from the catastrophe.  

Terra dragged Raven passed the bumper cars, and a house of mirrors.  A 
quick glance to her left revealed a nice hiding spot and the blonde 
continued to drag the staggering sorceress alongside her toward the 
building on her left.  Darkness greeted them, along with mirrors in 
every direction.  Her own panting echoed through the endless hallway, 
and Terra scurried through the maze of mirrors, glancing every now and 
then to the dazed Raven.

&quot;We need to call for backup,&quot; Raven finally spoke, forcing herself to a 
stand and relieving her weight from Terra&#39;s shoulder.  She reached 
behind her cloak, finding no communicator.  &quot;Damn, must have dropped it 
during the fight.  Quick, give me your communicator.&quot;

&quot;I ... I don&#39;t have it,&quot; Terra stammered out.  Raven let out a mild 
curse while slamming her closed fist into a mirror, forcing a spider web 
effect.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; she shouted afterward, finally noticing how fatigued she was.  
Raven attempted to calm herself within seconds, and then turned her 
vision to Terra.  &quot;We have to get back to the tower and-&quot;

&quot;Raven, I&#39;m not going back,&quot; Terra suddenly butted in while her vision 
fell.  A patch of blonde fell from her right ear where her 
butterfly-clip once held, covering that side of her face.  &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;  Raven blinked twice, giving her a look as if she hadn&#39;t heard 
the girl right.  &quot;Why can&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Because she&#39;s not your friend,&quot; echoed Slade&#39;s voice, forcing Raven to 
turn instantly toward a mirrored image of the mercenary.  All around 
her, Raven found the overconfident fa&#135;ade of Slade, which simply fueled 
her anger further.  The sorceress pushed forward cautiously, examining 
every image of the man, looking for the reflection&#39;s source.  &quot;She&#39;s my 
apprentice.&quot;

Footsteps sounded all around her, forcing Raven to turn about, finding 
nothing but reflection upon reflection.

&quot;Terra?&quot;  The blonde was nowhere to be seen.  &quot;Terra!&quot;

&quot;The girl you knew was merely an illusion,&quot; the voice echoed once again.  
The young girl&#39;s attention was brought to the several reflections of the 
mercenary, who stood as firm as he had when he first appeared, forcing a 
growl to escape Raven&#39;s throat.  &quot;In reality, she&#39;s been working for 
me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a lie!&quot;  Raven growled, her fist smashing into a mirror and 
shattering it completely with one single punch.  The image fell, though 
the man still remained all around her.  Raven growled, cocking back her 
fist once again.

&quot;I found her,&quot; he continued, with another smash echoing throughout the 
hallway.  &quot;I trained her to control her impressive powers.&quot;

Smash.  More glass pieces fell to the floor, cracking underneath Raven&#39;s 
azure leather boots.

&quot;And then I sent her to destroy your little T,&quot; followed by another 
smash.  &quot;From the inside out.&quot;

Another image shattered.  Realization soon hit Raven as she slowly 
backed away.  Broken glass, and a horrible stench of karma surrounded 
her with nearly all the mirrors shattered.

&quot;N-no!&quot;  Raven stuttered out, fear quickly filling her.  &quot;Terra would 
never-&quot;

From behind the sorceress, one mirror remained intact, with a clear view 
of the reflective image of Slade, who lowered his view to the girl.

&quot;Tonight her orders were to turn off the security system in the tower,&quot; 
he quickly interrupted the girl in mid sentence, with Raven turning to 
face the image before her.  &quot;But I guess she took pity on you.  Perhaps 
she wanted to keep you as a pet.&quot;

Raven&#39;s eyes lowered to the ground, her entire body trembling 
uncontrollably.  Was this the truth?  No ... it couldn&#39;t be.  Lies ... 
nothing but lies!

&quot;However, despite this minor error in judgment, she was kind enough to 
deactivate the security at Titans Tower,&quot; Slade continued as Raven&#39;s 
eyes widened in horror. 

&quot;Liar!&quot;  Raven screamed at the image, which shattered under her powers, 
forcing shards of glass to rain all over her body.  She ignored them, 
furiously turning about for the psychotic son of a-

&quot;Raven,&quot; came the blonde&#39;s voice finally, calming the girl slightly as 
she turned to find the source.  &quot;It&#39;s the truth.&quot;

Raven turned, finding the source of the voice at the single unbroken 
mirror, which lifted to find the mercenary and said blonde, standing 
with her hair covering her eyes.  Raven looked in disbelief, her whole 
face faltering and completely shattering her well-known stoic fa&#135;ade.  

&quot;Terra ... why?&quot;  Raven gaped, still unable to comprehend just what it 
was that was happening around her.

&quot;Because you could never give her what she needs,&quot; Slade laughed.  
Raven&#39;s eyes flared black and she leaped for the man, growling loudly.  
Slade&#39;s eyes glared and his hands reached out faster, reaching out to 
grasp her throat in mid flight.  He then hurled her back, passed several 
shattered mirrors and into a darkened portion of the hallway, coming to 
a stop at another mirror she hadn&#39;t taken her anger out on, sending a 
web of cracks upward when she landed.  Half lidded eyes looked up to the 
man as he stepped forward, a snarl escaping her throat as she launched 
forward once again in a burst of black energy.  

A beam of red energy suddenly smashed into her chest, knocking her 
straight through the glass this time and beyond eye&#39;s reach.  Slade 
gripped the plasma gun in his hand, aiming it to where the girl landed, 
continuing to move forward.  Terra let out a gasp as she watched the 
sorceress continue to take a beating, finally deciding to act when Slade 
readied himself to take aim on the girl again, moving to where she had 
landed and charged up the plasma gun for a point blank shot.  

&quot;No!&quot;  Terra quickly shouted, moving up in an attempt to block the man&#39;s 
shot.  &quot;I won&#39;t let you hurt my friend!&quot;

&quot;Dear child,&quot; Slade stated firmly, a smirk evident behind the mask.  
&quot;You don&#39;t have any friends.&quot;

Slade pushed the girl out of the way, forcing his gun through the 
shattered glass, with a single dangling piece falling to the ground.  
The inner parts of the hallway showed no signs of the sorceress, 
confusing the mercenary as he pulled back and searched about.  A black 
shadow suddenly flung over the mercenary&#39;s back, forcing him to turn 
around.  Dark crimson hues glared more evilly than Slade had ever seen 
upon the sorceress, filled with hate and rage.  The girl&#39;s form lifted 
from the shadows with her cloak stretching far beyond its normal length.  
The plasma gun was suddenly engulfed in a black mist and shattered in 
his grasp, the girl&#39;s face hidden within the lifted hood.  Her cloak 
stretched further, completely taking in the mercenary.  Raven then fell 
forward, vanishing within the shadows of her own magic, consuming both 
herself and Slade in a pool of black liquid.  In a splash, Terra was 
left completely alone.

With her actions finally catching up to her, Terra did the one thing she 
was used to.  She ran; ran as fast as she could.  Through the maze of 
mirrors, she sprinted with her hair trailing behind her.  Confused and 
completely lost, she fell to her knees, sobbing while her head was held 
in her hands and tears streamed down her cheeks.

&quot;Raven,&quot; she gaped in between her gasps for air.  &quot;Please, Raven, I&#39;m 
sorry.  He just wanted me to turn of the security system so he could 
delete some files.  I didn&#39;t know he was planning to do this ... I 
didn&#39;t mean for any of this to happen, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Then why did you let it?&quot;  Raven&#39;s harsh tone came up from behind the 
blonde, her eyes having returned to their normal dark violet hue.

&quot;I ... I don&#39;t know,&quot; Terra admitted honestly.  She finally stood, 
slipping a few strands of blonde behind her right ear.  &quot;Slade ... he 
helped me, saved me from myself.  He said I owed him, but-&quot;

&quot;So it was all a game?&quot;  Raven spat out in distaste with her fingers 
clenching tightly into two balled up fists.  &quot;You were just pretending?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;  Terra quickly defended.  &quot;He was the only one who wanted to truly 
help  me.  He helped me gain full control over my powers, and he can 
help you too.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe what I&#39;m hearing,&quot; Raven shouted as she threw her arms 
up into the air.  Terra had no control of her powers, and Raven far 
surpassed any lesson she could receive from that ... that ... she 
couldn&#39;t even come up with a word, she was so furious.

&quot;Raven, please,&quot; Terra begged, attempting to reach out to the sorceress 
with tears now streaming down her cheeks.  Raven sidestepped the girl&#39;s 
touch, while she pulled her hood up over her head to shadow her eyes.  
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Raven ... I truly am, and I know it&#39;s wrong of me to ask 
for your forgiveness, but you told me earlier tonight that sins could be 
forgiven.  Please ... I don&#39;t want to lose you as a friend.&quot;

&quot;Slade was right,&quot; Raven said coldly as she finally considered the girl 
with a severe glare.  &quot;You don&#39;t have any friends.&quot;

Like a two-by-four smacking her upside the head, Terra&#39;s eyes widened 
while her entire body froze.  Her heart suddenly shattered, crumbling 
into dust.  The sorceress turned her back to the girl, allowing the 
shadows to swallow her up.

&quot;Raven, please, no!&quot;

The sorceress was already gone.  Terra&#39;s hand was still stretched 
outward for a few moments, before Slade&#39;s shadow emerged from behind the 
girl&#39;s back.

&quot;Raven...&quot;  Terra&#39;s words were never heard, nor was her sentence 
completed as she continued to stare in the direction of where she last 
saw her, hoping to all the gods of heaven that she would return, forgive 
her, take her in her arms and tell her that everything would be alright.

&quot;Apprentice,&quot; the mercenary&#39;s cold voice called out to the girl.  
Terra&#39;s back straightened while her hair fell over the right side of her 
face, covering her sadden sapphire eyes.  &quot;Come.&quot;

Emotions swirled around the blonde.  Anger, hate, distrust, sadness, and 
several others she couldn&#39;t even find a name for.  The man had played 
her like a fool.  He had explained to her to stop burning bridges, but 
he had just burnt her last one.  Her head lowered even farther while her 
brows lowered, her sad expression changing to that of rage.

&quot;You ... you lied to me,&quot; Terra&#39;s voice was quiet, as she shrugged the 
man&#39;s hand from her shoulder, feeling as if it had burned through her 
skin.  &quot;You lied!&quot;

Before Slade had anytime to bring up any sort of remark, Terra&#39;s aura 
exploded around her and forced the rock beneath the marble flooring to 
lift, quickly smashing through the ceiling of the maze.  A look of pure 
rage expressed upon her features and her hands made a closing motion, 
slapping them together as the entire building collapsed upon itself.  
Terra wanted to fall to her knees and cry.  She wanted to give up on 
everything, and explain to Raven that it was all a mistake, that she was 
terribly sorry for what she had done.  But there was no turning back 
now.  In order for her to repent for her sins, she would have to finish 
exactly what she started, and when the man was spotted several hundred 
yards away, toward the entrance of the park, she knew what it was she 
needed to end ... Slade&#39;s life.



xXxXxXxXx



&quot;Raven, where are you?  Answer me!&quot;  Robin yelled into his communicator 
while hunched down behind a piece of rubble within the main room of 
Titans Tower.  Lasers were shooting out in all directions while Cyborg 
and Starfire attempted to fend off the army of Slade&#39;s robots who had 
somehow infiltrated the Tower after the alarm had been set.  A green 
mouse suddenly snuck in underneath the doorway that Cyborg and Starfire 
attempted to keep shut, which continued to bend inward from the android 
army&#39;s attack.  &quot;She&#39;s not responding.&quot;

&quot;And Terra&#39;s not in her room,&quot; Beast Boy quickly shouted while reverting 
back to his human form.  Robin cocked a brow while his vision turned to 
the breaking door.

&quot;Somebody want to explain how two hundred armed robots got past my 
security?&quot;  Cyborg demanded to know while his arm transformed into a 
sonic cannon.  He grasped it with his left hand and shifted his weight 
while he aimed it toward the door that seemed ready to break.  The door 
was smashed open with several bots pouring out.  Cyborg unleashed a 
devastating blast, which Starfire combined with a beam of green energy 
from her palms, completely disintegrating them before they stepped foot 
in the room.  The Tamaranian let out a cry and soured through the 
doorway, with the sound of her starbolts tearing through more armed 
bots.  Cyborg retracted his arm as it reverted back, quickly rushing 
over to the console next to the door and ripping of its side paneling.  
After pulling out a few wires, he attempted to reactivate the security 
system.  Further tampering resulted in an electric shock, and a yelp of 
pain from the half metal Titan.  &quot;Can&#39;t even access the computer!  We&#39;re 
locked out!&quot;

&quot;They are too numerous to fight!&quot;  Starfire shouted from beyond the 
room, while letting out another shout and a barrage of starbolts to 
follow.  Beast Boy clamped his hair, nearly pulling a good chunk out, 
quickly turning to his leader for support.  Robin&#39;s brows were forced 
downward as he stood up from his crouched stance, replacing the 
communicator to his utility belt.  &quot;What shall we do?&quot;

&quot;Fight anyway,&quot; Robin quickly shouted, pointing into the direction of 
the hallway.  &quot;Titans!  Go!&quot;

The team rushed into the hallway with Robin leading them.  With a quick 
leap, Robin caught one robot with a flying sidekick, while decapitating 
another with a quick throw of a birdarang.  This bought him only a 
moment as a third aimed to punch at his head.  Without even looking, 
Robin quickly ducked under the strike and came back with a devastating 
uppercut that lifted the soldier clear off its feet.  A brutal kick was 
then delivered that sent it clear across the room.  

&quot;Coming through!&quot;

Robin dove out of the way as a sprinting rhinoceros trampled through the 
hallway, carrying the half metal Titan who had warned the boy wonder.  A 
beam of energy tore through one bot while Beast Boy&#39;s horn tore through 
another.  A plasma gun quickly put a stop to the changeling&#39;s path, 
catching two shots to the large animal&#39;s leg.  The creature toppled to 
the floor forcing Cyborg to roll forward, with an army of androids 
quickly surrounding him.  Hoping to his feet, Cyborg slammed his fist 
into the face of one while spinning quickly and smashing his fist 
through another.  Several more attempted to jump onto his back, but a 
quick shifting octopus wrapped its tentacles around the three of them, 
yanking them off and hurling them to the other side of the hallway.

One was suddenly torn in half by a green glowing fist of a furiously 
enraged Tamaranian redhead, who screamed as her fists collided with 
another, wrapping her solar energy around her fists and smashing droid 
after droid.  Her fiercely glowing jaded eyes blinked back to normal as 
they traveled further down the hallway, where three bots suddenly 
vacated a darkened room, with more coming down from the corner.  She let 
out a gasp, and then glared the five bots down as they rushed toward her 
direction.

&quot;That is friend Raven&#39;s bedroom!&quot;  She screamed out, bursting toward 
them.  A quick spin and her boots completely shattered the skull of one, 
leaping from one to the other and resulting in the same head-exploding 
effect.  She landed in a crouched position after all five bots exploded, 
standing upright and turning to five more that rounded the corner at the 
end of the hall.  Her feet parted as she summoned two large glowing 
spheres in her hand, grasping them as the bright green light lit up the 
hallway.  &quot;No one is permitted where Raven slumbers!&quot;

She clasped her hands together, raising them above her head.  With a war 
cry she smashed her closed fists down to the red carpet, completely 
destroying the floor.  An earthquake-like effect traveled all the way 
down the hallway, first lifting the bots where they stood then lowering 
them to the floor below.  The entire Tower shook from the Tamaranian&#39;s 
power, with her attack doing more harm than good.  The floor beneath 
Cyborg suddenly shook, with a barrage of bots tumbling to the floor 
below.  The half metal Titan followed the same fate, with floor rubble 
to break his fall.  Being the first to stand, Cyborg finally noticed 
just how outnumbered his team was, viewing the entire hallway of the 
floor below completely packed with Slade&#39;s robots.

He let out a gasp before a large metal beam suddenly struck his head and 
knocked him right into a wall, nearly straight through it.  He regained 
his composure enough to duck under a punch and delivers one to the 
android&#39;s midsection.  He lifted the robot up and threw him in the 
opposite direction, knocking over three more.  One after another the 
robots leaped onto Cyborg&#39;s back while one grappled him into a headlock.  
Cyborg slammed his back into the wall knocking two off while he reached 
behind him and ripped the third off, spinning around and launching him 
into a group of robots.

&quot;Don&#39;t know how you guys got in,&quot; he grunted as he dodged a punch.  &quot;But 
I know how you&#39;re getting out!&quot;

With his right fist cocked back, he let out a yell and crashed through 
one robot&#39;s solar plexus.  The robot dropped to the floor in an 
explosion of sparks.  Another leaped onto Cyborg&#39;s back once again but 
is suddenly lifted from the half metal Titan and thrown clear across the 
room.  A large green furred ape roared loudly and pounded two bots with 
one blow, and wound up his hand for a second strike.  The large beast 
grabbed another and hurled him up through the hole in the floor, only to 
collide with another that was thrown back by the powerful redhead.  
Starfire then punched straight through another bot and continued to 
follow through with her strike, which collided with two more before her 
fist swung to the right, forcing a total of three robots through the 
wall with one single strike.  Fists and starbolts suddenly flew out in 
every direction before several reinforcements dropped from out of 
nowhere, completely overtaking the girl before she had time to think.  

The Tamaranian Princess was dropped as several more attempted to crush 
her against the floor.  Struggling with all her might did no good, as 
the dog pile continued to grow.  Her teeth clenched tightly while her 
eyes sparked a bright green hue with the intensity of the light growing 
with each passing second.  A beam of green light shot through one bot, 
then another arose.  Several more were forced out until a green 
explosion lit up the hallway, forcing the rest of the bots to smash into 
the ceiling, and walls, taking out the rest of the group within the 
hallway.  When the glare of light subsided, a furious Starfire breathed 
heavily with her eyes still glowing a deep forest green hue.  Exhaustion 
suddenly fell over her fa&#135;ade before her levitated stance left, dropping 
her form to the ground and passing out from the Herculean exertion.

The hallway lights began to flicker, with a small group of survivors 
gathered around a particular item.  One bot clamped a small device to 
the wall while another began operating a control panel that had been set 
to the side.  A disk suddenly whistled by them and smashed directly into 
the device, detonated it and threw the robots backward.  Robin stood at 
the end of the hallway with his metal staff in one hand while one of the 
bots fell at his feet.  Another rushed toward him but a simple extend of 
his staff knocked him back with ease.  Another moved in, but a simple 
twirl of his arms brought the back end of his pole to the cranium of his 
would-be attacker.  The boy wonder leaped up to the ceiling and 
forcefully brought his weapon of choice down, crashing through the skull 
of a third.  Several more came into view, which brought the Titan&#39;s 
leader to a low growl.  With a cry of his own, he swung his staff and 
charged the four remaining robot androids.

Beams of plasma attempted to shoot him dead in his tracks, but the 
martial artist was quick, weaving to the left and dodging to the right, 
shredding the distance between himself and the remaining survivors.  
With a quick leap, he side kicked one in the side of the head and used 
the bot to jump to the side, kneeing another with the same leg.  
Twirling his body in mid air still, his weapon came across at an amazing 
speed, enough to make a whistling sound, and completely decapitated 
another.  Crouching down to land, he continuously back-flipped out of 
the reach of the last one, who pulled out a plasma gun to finish the 
Titan off.  The leader simply smirked, while waving his index finger to 
the robot.  A tilt of his head showed the robots confusion, until he 
noticed the red flashing light at his feet.  Its eyes widened a medium 
sized explosion completely over took its body.  When the smoke cleared 
there was nothing but rubble left.



xXxXxXxXx



&quot;Well,&quot; Cyborg finally said as the last of Slade&#39;s robot army was thrown 
into the center pile of metal body parts.  &quot;Looks like we won.&quot;

The entire place had been uplifted, with the ceilings and floors filled 
with holes.  A large section of the main room gave a good sunroof to the 
gym below, with hanging limbs from Slade&#39;s androids hanging limply from 
the edges.  Small sparks were erupting from severed wires while Cyborg 
began to fiddle with a side panel on his robotic arm.

&quot;Then why does it not feel like a victory?&quot;  Starfire asked sadly, as 
she levitated to the floor uneasily, grasping one arm and rubbing it 
slightly.  Robin sighed as his view shifted to the floor, rubbing the 
back of his neck where the butt end of a plasma gun had struck.

&quot;I&#39;ve regained access to the computer,&quot; Cyborg spoke out after a few 
moments.  &quot;Security codes and encryption strings have all been reset.&quot;

&quot;Yea, and all of Slade&#39;s surveillance stuff&#39;s gone,&quot; Beast Boy added in, 
while Starfire nodded along.

&quot;Yes, all of his technology has been located and destroyed,&quot; she added 
in, though couldn&#39;t shake the dark cloud that loomed overhead.

&quot;I know it.  I knew it!&quot;  A shout sounded from the shattered window of 
the main room.  Raven flew in, touching her boots to the stained remains 
of the carpet, fury evident in her face.  

&quot;Raven!&quot;  Robin gasped.  The sorceress appeared more broken and beat 
rest of his team.  &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Slade,&quot; she spat out while she surveyed the damage.

&quot;Where&#39;s Terra?&quot;  Beast Boy suddenly asked.  The very mention of the 
traitor&#39;s name only fueled her rage further.  

&quot;That ... that,&quot; she growled as her eyes traveled over what was once her 
home.  &quot;That traitorous bitch is Slade&#39;s new apprentice!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;  The entire team gasped in shock.  Robin stepped forward, 
attempting to aid the sorceress who seemed to be limping on her right 
leg.  Beast Boy reached her first however, and completely bombarded the 
girl with questions.

&quot;New apprentice?  That&#39;s ridiculous!&quot;  The changeling shouted, quickly 
moving himself in front of the witch.  &quot;There&#39;s just no way!  There&#39;s 
gotta be a -&quot;

&quot;Believe it!&quot;  Raven snapped back, forcing her way passed the green 
skinned Titan with a shove of her shoulder.  &quot;She&#39;s the one that 
deactivated the security system.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Cyborg quickly chimed in, viewing the remains of the 
security video that showed the blonde doing just as Raven had said.  
&quot;But why?&quot;

&quot;Because she was working for Slade the entire time!&quot;  Raven continued to 
rant.  &quot;We should have never trusted her!&quot;

&quot;But we did,&quot; Robin attempted to calm the girl, feeling as if she had 
attempted to carry the burden alone.  The boy wonder had rarely seen the 
girl raise her voice, and felt her attitude could only worsen the 
situation.  &quot;We all did.&quot;

&quot;But why?&quot;  Starfire was completely lost, unable to comprehend the cause 
of the girl&#39;s actions.  &quot;Were we not good friends?&quot;

&quot;We were never friends to begin with,&quot; Raven replied to the princess, 
her tone growing cold as her eyes lowered.  &quot;She played us.  She played 
us all for fools.&quot;

Starfire&#39;s jaded eyes shifted to the sorceress whose hood prevented the 
sight of her lilac hues.  Her fa&#135;ade softened as she attempted to reach 
out to the girl.

&quot;Raven,&quot; Starfire started, though the sorceress turned away from the 
girl&#39;s touch.

&quot;I have to go meditate,&quot; she quickly informed them as her levitated form 
floated away from the group.  &quot;My wounds are still fresh.&quot;

Starfire retracted her hand and clasped it with the other, then rested 
them against her chest while her vision dropped to the damaged flooring.  
A shadow picked up around the sorceress and in an instant she was 
swallowed up by her own magic.  Robin knew the girl was injured, but 
felt that there was more behind her words than she led on.  He made a 
glance toward Cyborg who merely shook his head to his leader.  The half 
metal Titan then searched around, noticing they were now two members 
short.

&quot;Where&#39;s Beast Boy?&quot;

Surrounded by the darkness of Terra&#39;s trashed and demolished room, a 
green melancholy dog sat on the bed with his head hung low and large 
eyes sadden to the fullest.  The animal let out a whine as it suited 
itself in a more comfortable position, viewing what was once his best 
friend&#39;s room.

&quot;He just needs a little time.&quot;
