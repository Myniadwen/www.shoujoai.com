<h1>Day and Night (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/daynite-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The stately manor that stood not far from New York
city could almost be called a castle, the turrets and
silouette looking almost like something lifted from a
bygone age. Within a grey haired man sat at his desk
in his library, studying certain documents as he
gently stroked his neatly trimmed beard.

&quot;Mr Macduff,&quot; the rather seedy looking investigator
handed over the files, &quot;here&#39;s my report on Ms.
Destine&#39;s activities.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Mr. Cheung,&quot; Macbeth nodded, taking the
documents. He smiled slightly, &quot;Is this a new face?&quot;

Terry Cheung nodded as the black haired young man
pointed to a picture, &quot;Her name is Alicia Sevarius.&quot;
He smiled grimly, &quot;Yes, related to the infamous Anton
Sevarius. I think Ms. Destine may have... plans for
her?&quot;

&quot;A lever for access to Anton&#39;s technology?&quot; Macbeth
mused aloud as he rose, his long coat flowing around
him, &quot;Or something else?&quot;

&quot;It also seems that Destine has broken from her usual
pattern of behavior with this assistant,&quot; Terry noted.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Macbeth looked curious.

&quot;Taking her out to lunch and occasionally breakfast,&quot;
Terry checked his notes, &quot;I can&#39;t think of any
assistant she socialized with before.&quot;

&quot;Dominique never shows such weakness,&quot; Macbeth shook
his head, &quot;you can be sure she has something else in
mind for the girl.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Terry said briskly, &quot;that finishes my report.&quot;

&quot;Take the envelope on my desk,&quot; Macbeth said as he
stood by the window, &quot;your pay and a bonus is within.&quot;
As the man collected his pay and hurried off Macbeth
looked thoughtful, &quot;However, whatever Demona is up to,
I may be able to use the distraction to my
advantage...&quot;

&quot;Mrs Xanatos,&quot; Alicia rose from her desk as she
respectfully greeted the striking orange haired woman,
&quot;Is Ms Destine expecting...?&quot;

&quot;Call me Fox, please,&quot; Fox smiled, her expression
remarkably gentle, even with the blue fox head tattoo
over her eye, &quot;whenever I hear Mrs Xanatos I look for
David&#39;s mother.&quot;

&quot;Fox, then,&quot; Alicia smiled slightly as she continued
to firmly ask, &quot;do you have a appointment, ma&#39;am?&quot;
With that she moved in Fox&#39;s way, meeting the woman&#39;s
steely glance with one of her own.

&quot;You&#39;re pretty good at guarding your mistress&#39;
sanctuary,&quot; Fox noted after a moment, &quot;most assistants
would be bowled over.&quot; She smiled suddenly, &quot;Want a
job? I bet I can match anything she&#39;d offer...&quot;

&quot;No, thanks I...&quot; Alicia started.

&quot;Stop trying to poach my staff, Fox,&quot; Dominique said
firmly, the redhead emerging from her office with a
forceful stride. &quot;Thanks for handling her until I
finished the teleconference,&quot; she smiled at Alicia
before facing Fox, &quot;I&#39;ll see you now.&quot;

&quot;Keep my offer in mind,&quot; Fox said as she strode by,
her black business wear hugging her shapely body.

Within the office Dominique firmly shut the sound
proofed door as she said coldly, &quot;What do you and
Xanatos want?&quot;

Fox sat down uninvited, the woman&#39;s manner suddenly
going from near flirtatious to serious. &quot;As you no
doubt know Demona, David and I have established a
truce with the Manhattan Gargoyle clan,&quot; she began.

Demona narrowed her eyes a bit as she agreed, &quot;Since
Goliath helped fight off Oberon and save your son.&quot;

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Fox nodded. She smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;m even
trying to win back Lexington&#39;s trust, though it&#39;s been
hard...&quot;

Demona cut her off as she forcefully asked her, &quot;What
does this all have to do with me?&quot;

Fox&#39;s expression remained mild as she said, &quot;Two
things, then. Firstly, we will be VERY upset if you
attempt any kind of hostile action against the
gargoyles or their home, second, we would strongly
urge you to cease your feud with the clan, too.&quot;

&quot;Are you insane?&quot; Demona growled, &quot;Goliath and his
clan are my enemies!&quot;

&quot;Do you know how many gargoyles there are left?&quot; Fox
asked suddenly. Not waiting for a answer she
continued, &quot;David has been looking... so far all he
has found have been clans in London, South America and
here.&quot;

&quot;Your point?&quot; Demona asked.

&quot;How many gargoyles do you need for a breeding
population? How many can you lose before inbreeding
kills your kind?&quot; Fox asked seriously, &quot;You could be
over the limit already, and you cannot afford to lose
any more.&quot;

Demona sat back, her expression troubled as she said,
&quot;I&#39;ll... consider it.&quot;

Fox left quietly, the young woman stopping to thank
Alicia before heading back to Xanatos&#39; Aerie. Giving
her employer a few moments Alicia went for some
coffee, then knocked on the still closed door as she
called, &quot;Ma&#39;am, would you like a coffee?&quot;

Demona was startled from her grim thoughts, sitting up
as she brought her expressions under control. &quot;Come
in,&quot; she called, watching with some amusement as
Alicia used her shapely hip to force the door open
then carried in the cup and a plate of cinnamon rolls.

&quot;I brought you a snack,&quot; Alicia added as she sat the
rolls down. On one of their recent lunch trips Alicia
had gotten her boss to try the sweet treats, and
Dominique had discovered she liked them a lot.

&quot;My greatest weakness,&quot; Dominique smiled wryly as she
grabbed one, taking a bite and savoring the flavor.

&quot;You looked rather grim when I came in,&quot; Alicia said
after a moment, perching on the edge of her desk, &quot;did
Mrs. Xanatos upset you?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Dominique conceded, debating
what to tell the girl. &quot;Some old family business she
needed to bring up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Alicia said gently, reaching out and
putting a hand over Dominique&#39;s.

Demona felt a odd thrill as Alicia touched her,
startled by the sensation of skin on skin. For years
she had known only blows, then recently felt the false
touches of fake love from both Thailog and Macbeth.
This was different, a sweeter feeling as the girl
looked up so innocently into her eyes.

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Alicia drew back her hand nervously.

Gracefully Dominique reached out, cradling those
fingers in her own. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she smiled, &quot;in
fact, I just had a idea. How&#39;s my schedule for this
afternoon?&quot;

&quot;Fairly light,&quot; Alicia rummaged through her memory,
&quot;only a meeting with a Pack Studios representative on
our participation in Pack 2.0.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s grab some lunch,&quot; Dominique grinned, &quot;you
can tell me more about that Gargoyle you seem so hung
up about.&quot;

Alicia blushed as she hopped down from her seat on the
side of the desk and followed her boss, &quot;I am NOT hung
up.&quot; She paused, &quot;I admire her, though...&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Macbeth watched covertly as the two women left
Nightstone enterprises, using a device similar to a
directional microphone to listen to them talk. He
followed through a cheerful lunch, listening with a
perplexed expression as they chatted cheerfully and
Demona showed no signs of her usual hatred of men.

&#39;Well, except when the waiter tried to flirt with her
companion,&#39; Macbeth thought as he drank a coffee in a
nearby caf&#130;.

Macbeth recalled his own romance with &#39;Dominique&#39; and
had to admit their conversation had never been as
relaxed as these two&#39;s. Dominique seemed to hang on
Alicia&#39;s words, while the smaller blonde seemed deeply
taken of her companion. They almost reminded him of
long lost soulmates, reunited once more.

&#39;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on,&#39; Macbeth conceded, &#39;but
it clearly isn&#39;t one of Demona&#39;s usual plots.&#39;
Silently he resolved to keep monitoring the
situation... if Demona reverted to type, he&#39;d act.
Otherwise, he&#39;d just wait and see.
