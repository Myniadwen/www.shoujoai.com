<h1>The Adventures of Shadowcat and Rogue! (part 31 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch30.html">Back to Part 30</a><pre>        Kitty looked in the bedroom worriedly, gazing in at the sleeping 
figure laying there. Rogue&#39;s reddish hair fell around her face, her skin 
awfully pale, somehow, matching the white streaks. A fading bruise was 
on her cheek, her breathing coming slow and even.

        &quot;How is she?&quot; Ororo asked, keeping her voice down. Long white 
hair flowed over her shoulders, her skin chocolate brown.

        &quot;She&#39;s still out cold,&quot; Kitty murmured. The two of them walked 
away from the sleeping figure as the brown haired girl continued 
speaking softly, &quot;She has bruises, Ororo, even burns. Shouldn&#39;t her 
invulnerability have protected her?&quot;

        &quot;It might just be a side effect of the power boost,&quot; Ororo 
offered, &quot;she might have to be aware for her powers to be fully active.&quot; 
She looked over at Kitty with a worried frown, &quot;Have you eaten since we 
came back?&quot;

        &quot;I had a sandwich earlier,&quot; Kitty shrugged. She ran a hand 
through her brown hair and offered a smile, &quot;Did Bishop drop off McCoy 
and what was left of Stryfe with the police?&quot;

        &quot;Cat was entertained,&quot; Ororo agreed. They walked into the living 
room, the assembled X-men and guest looking up in concern.

        Yuriko sat on the couch, her cybernetics concealed by her simple 
clothing. The black haired Asian rose and asked, &quot;Has Rogue awakened?&quot;

        &quot;Not yet,&quot; Kitty said with a sigh. She was a little surprised to 
see Yuriko still here, but her concern for Rogue was honest.

        &quot;She has the heart of a samurai,&quot; Yuriko said simply, &quot;such a 
one will not let a thing like this defeat her.&quot; With that, she strode 
off.

        &quot;Well, that was interesting,&quot; Kitty blinked.

        &quot;She means well, I think,&quot; Elizabeth offered. The purple haired 
telekinetic was sitting in a chair with Neal, the two relaxing. &quot;So did 
the others get clean away?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;It appears so,&quot; Sage nodded, looking oddly incomplete without 
Heather standing nearby. Lifeguard was on duty down on the beach, and as 
much as Sage wanted to be down there with her the pale black haired 
woman felt her duty was here. &quot;Feral seems to have spirited Sakura 
away,&quot; Sage smiled slightly, &quot;though we have heard from Plasma and 
Polaris.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, really?&quot; Kitty looked surprised.

        &quot;Polaris says she and Plasma are going to destroy the Living 
Pharaoh&#39;s forces,&quot; Sage said dryly, &quot;at least according to the voice 
message they left.&quot;

        &quot;Should keep them busy,&quot; Ororo noted.

        &quot;And hopefully out of trouble,&quot; Neal offered with a smile.

        &quot;Keep who out of trouble?&quot; the voice asked. They turned to see 
Rogue standing there in the doorway, leaning up against the wall for 
support.

        &quot;Rogue,&quot; Kitty rushed over to her lover&#39;s side, looking up at 
her in concern. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; she asked worriedly.

        &quot;I feel weak as a kitten,&quot; Rogue admitted quietly, &quot;pardon the 
pun, and I think I could eat a horse. Have we got anything to eat?&quot;

        Rogue took a step and stumbled slightly, Ororo moving forward to 
grab her arm before she fell. &quot;Oh, no,&quot; she murmured, realizing that she 
had grabbed Rogue&#39;s bare arm with her hand...

        ...and nothing happened. &quot;Whoa,&quot; Rogue blinked, looking up at 
Ororo in surprise. &quot;Nothing,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;no effect at all.&quot;

        Kitty reached out to take Rogue&#39;s hand, shutting down her 
phasing power entirely. &quot;Anything?&quot; Kitty asked softly.

        &quot;Nope,&quot; Rogue closed her eyes, concentrating. She seemed to be 
gritting her teeth, then sighed, &quot;Nothin&#39; works. No strength, flight, 
none of my powers seem to be there.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Sage had a frown on her face, &quot;this must be 
connected to what I did when I enhanced your powers.&quot;

        Rogue had the oddest look on her face, &quot;You think it&#39;s 
permanent?&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Sage admitted.

        &quot;It&#39;s possible your abilities might return in time,&quot; Ororo 
quietly offered, looking at her teammate in concern.

        &quot;Either way,&quot; Rogue said, &quot;for now I don&#39;t have any powers, 
guys.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;So what do we do know?&quot;

        &quot;I think I have a suggestion,&quot; Kitty said with a slight smile.

        It took a few days to get everything organized, but they managed 
pretty well. They wanted to get this done before Kitty and Rogue left, 
of course. After a certain amount of discussion they had decided to take 
a vacation for awhile, to give Rogue&#39;s powers a chance to return.

        The Blackbird descended on the nearby beach, coming to a rest 
out on the water as the passengers disembarked. Professor Xavier led the 
way, soon followed by Jean, Scott, Emma, Kurt. Logan and a few of their 
other teammates.

        There was a loud displacement of air and Kurt disappeared, 
reappearing at Kitty&#39;s side. The blue furred man beamed as he pulled her 
into a hug, &quot;Is it true? Is my little Katzchen getting married?&quot;

        Kitty laughed, &quot;Yeah, we decided it was about time, so...&quot;

        &quot;Congratulations,&quot; a smile tugged at Scott&#39;s usually dour 
expression, his brown hair falling in front of his ruby quartz glasses.

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Jean hugged the younger girl close, the redhead 
smiling.

        &quot;Never thought I&#39;d see the day,&quot; Logan laughed, his short black 
hair swept back in it&#39;s distinctive style.

        &quot;Thank you for inviting us,&quot; Professor Xavier smiled at her, the 
bald headed man putting his hand on her shoulder.

        &quot;You&#39;re all family to me,&quot; Kitty said simply. She laughed, &quot;I 
shouldn&#39;t be hogging you all, the others will want to see you.&quot;

        &quot;Lead the way,&quot; Emma Frost smiled, her white hair flowing down 
her back, dressed in her much racier version of the X-men uniform.

        There was a moment of tension as the Professor and the others 
entered the living room, the splinter group confronting their parent, 
but the occasion seemed to help put aside any of the remaining 
bitterness. There were still a few surprises in store, however.

        &quot;Yuriko?&quot; Logan blinked as he walked over to where Lady 
Deathstryke stood. His former blood-enemy wore the same X-men uniform as 
the other members of the group. He looked her up and down, &quot;I&#39;ll be 
damned.&quot;

        &quot;I no longer have a feud with you,&quot; Deathstryke said simply, 
&quot;nor any of Xavier&#39;s students.&quot; A slight smile, &quot;And I found I enjoyed 
fighting by their side against Stryfe. So when Kitty suggested me as her 
replacement, I said yes.&quot;

        &quot;Storm&#39;s got a good eye,&quot; Logan grinned. His eyes narrowed 
slightly as she walked through the crowd towards him, &quot;And here she 
comes now.&quot; Deathstryke, deciding this might just be trouble, smoothly 
slipped away.

        &quot;Logan,&quot; Ororo looked just a bit nervous as she introduced the 
woman beside her, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet my lover, Raven Darkholme.&quot;

        Logan tilted his head to the side as he growled, &quot;Been awhile, 
Mystique. You planning on staying with the side of the angels?&quot;

        &quot;I love her,&quot; Raven reached out to take Ororo&#39;s hand in hers as 
she continued firmly, &quot;and I&#39;d never betray that.&quot;

        Logan met her eyes, studying her intently. A slight smile, &quot;All 
right, that&#39;s fair enough. I seem to remember you bein&#39; pretty loyal, 
back in the day.&quot; He looked over at Ororo, &quot;You usually don&#39;t guess 
wrong, &#39;Roro. Hope you&#39;re right this time.&quot;

        &quot;That was warm,&quot; Raven quietly said to Ororo as Logan excused 
himself, quickly moving over to talk to Elizabeth.

        &quot;It went better than I was expecting, actually,&quot; Ororo admitted 
as she squeezed Raven&#39;s hand. &quot;Give him time,&quot; she added.

        &quot;Professor,&quot; Rogue grinned, hugging him close. She laughed at 
his startled expression, &quot;I&#39;ve been using the opportunity to do that a 
lot, lately.&quot;

        &quot;Understandable,&quot; Charles Xavier agreed. He tilted his head to 
the side as he offered, &quot;You seem truly happy.&quot;

        &quot;I am,&quot; Rogue looked over at Kitty with fondness, &quot;I love her, 
more than I ever expected to love anyone else.&quot;

        &quot;And Remy?&quot; Jean asked about Gambit softly.

        &quot;Tried to contact him,&quot; Rogue sighed, &quot;I wanted him to hear it 
from me.&quot;

        &quot;So what are you two planning?&quot; Scott asked curiously, carrying 
a cup of coffee with him.

        &quot;A bit of a honeymoon,&quot; Rogue smiled, &quot;we&#39;re gonna spend a few 
weeks up at Kitty&#39;s cabin, just the two of us. Kitty was also thinking 
of stopping in at the school later, if my powers don&#39;t kick back in on 
their own.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll be ready to help,&quot; the Professor agreed.

        Emma walked over to where Kitty stood by the mini-bar, getting 
herself a fruit drink. &quot;How are you?&quot; Emma softly asked.

        &quot;Managing,&quot; Kitty said honestly. &quot;What Sakura did to me all 
those years ago, it left it&#39;s damage,&quot; she said softly, &quot;but I&#39;ll get 
over it, I think.&quot;

        &quot;Let me know if there&#39;s anything I can do to help,&quot; Emma said 
honestly. She looked across the crowd, wincing a bit as Ororo glared 
back at her.

        &quot;You want a piece of unsolicited advice?&quot; Kitty offered. Emma 
looked over at her curiously and Kitty shrugged, &quot;Apologize. It&#39;s the 
only way you&#39;ll start being something other than enemies.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Emma replied, keeping her voice neutral. She smiled 
slightly, &quot;Are you going to wear that for the wedding?&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Kitty checked her watch, &quot;and it&#39;s about time to get 
changed. See you!&quot;

        Ororo and Kitty retired to a bedroom, even as Raven and Rogue 
went into another one. &quot;Thanks, Mom,&quot; Rogue smiled as Raven helped her 
slip the suit on, being careful to avoid all the bandages and burns.

        &quot;We really should have let you heal up a bit longer,&quot; Raven 
noted, adjusting the tie. Rogue had chosen to wear a suit, and she 
looked good in the crisp black garment.

        &quot;Considering how often we get caught up in trouble,&quot; Rogue 
replied with a smile, &quot;I thought we should take advantage of the 
relative quiet.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Raven acknowledged, taking a step back to look her 
daughter over. &quot;You look terrific, of course,&quot; she smiled.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Rogue smiled a little sadly thinking of her other 
adopted mother, &quot;but I just wish that Irene could be here.&quot;

        &quot;She is, sort of,&quot; Raven produced a letter from her pocket, 
handing it over.

        Rogue unfolded it, reading Irene Alder&#39;s gentle script. 
&quot;Congratulations,&quot; she read aloud, &quot;I&#39;m not using my gift to foresee 
this event, but instead hope that you will find love, someday. Whoever 
it is, be happy, and know your future is your own to make.&quot;

        The trees were dark where he stood, looking down at the beach 
house and the preparations that were going on in the backyard. Chairs 
were set up, and it looked like the ceremony itself was going to be 
performed beneath a vine covered wooden arch.

        &quot;You coming down to join the party, Cajun?&quot; Logan asked him 
gruffly, a lit cigar held between his teeth.

        Remy Lebeau shook his head slightly, reddish brown hair falling 
into red eyes, &quot;No, I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;d be like a ghost at the party, 
reminding everyone what could have been.&quot;

        &quot;They wouldn&#39;t have invited you,&quot; Logan reminded him, &quot;if they 
didn&#39;t want you there.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks, my friend,&quot; Remy shot him an honest smile, &quot;but no.&quot; 
With that he turned, trenchcoat swirling around him, and walked away.</pre>
