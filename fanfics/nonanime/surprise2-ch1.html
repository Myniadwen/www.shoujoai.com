<h1>Surprise 2</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/overstreet.html">Clayton Overstreet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>  Kim Possible stared down at the envelopes in her hand and considered. 
This had been a common event for the last two years. Still, she had to 
think carefully before going through with it. They were her archenemies 
after all and then there were the more recent events that could cause 
some seriously awkward moments. 
  &quot;Get yourself together Possible. Remember your motto, you can do 
anything.&quot; She shoved them into the mailbox and turned away. 
  It was always hard inviting Drakken and Shego over for Christmas. But 
since the first time everyone in the family had insisted and it was true 
that he always put all of his villainous plans on hold for the holidays. 
Actually, when she thought about it, Drakken was not even considered to 
be that dangerous a criminal. His entire criminal record consisted of 
theft and assault charges because technically nothing else he did was 
actually illegal. Weather machines, doomsday devices, and the like 
weren&#39;t actually covered by any laws in any countries and he never 
succeeded anyway. Kim paid Shego an extra thousand dollars a month and 
worked as her sparring partner to make sure of that. 
  Actually that was one of the things she was worried about. Her parents 
knew about the business part of her deal with Shego. They paid for it. 
But there were certain aspects she had been keeping from them for the 
past six months. Things even Wade didn&#39;t know. Ro had found out by 
accident and that had been embarrassing enough. 
  He communicator beeped and she picked it up. &quot;Hey Wade what&#39;s the 
sitch?&quot; 
  &quot;DN Amy just stole a bunch of chemicals from a secret lab in Russia. 
I&#39;ve done an analysis and...&quot; 
  &quot;And she&#39;s going to use them to turn a bunch of people into mutants?&quot; 
  &quot;Well yeah.&quot; 
  &quot;You know, a lot of these villains have no imagination. They do the 
same thing over and over every time. At least Drakken comes up with 
different inventions.&quot; 
  &quot;Actually he usually just has Shego steal them. He only uses his own 
work maybe once out of every ten times. Speaking of which, are he and 
Shego coming to your place again this year?&quot;
  &quot;Yeah, the family always insists. Especially the twins.&quot; 
  &quot;He does get them some of their favorite gifts. Remember last year&#39;s 
particle accelerator that they used to create a perpetual motion device? 
That was pretty impressive.&quot;
  &quot;Yeah, until it turned out that they used it to power a rocket that 
spread my underwear all over town. Honestly, they&#39;re probably going to 
be the ones I end up saving the world from when they grow up.&quot; 
  &quot;If they are, I&#39;m going to quit.&quot; 
  &quot;Thanks for the support,&quot; Kim mumbled. &quot;Anyway, when does my ride get 
here?&quot; 
  &quot;Any second now they&#39;ll show up for you and swing by for Ron. I called 
in a favor from our friends at Area 51.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you sure you can&#39;t swing by for Christmas?&quot; 
  &quot;Sorry Kim, but my parents have plans. I&#39;ll try to make a call, but 
don&#39;t count on it.&quot;
  Suddenly a flying saucer appeared in the sky above her and Kim found 
herself staring into a bright light. When her vision cleared she saw 
some gray aliens standing in front of her. &quot;Hey guys, thanks for the 
ride.&quot;
  Their translators clicked for a moment before one said, &quot;It is not 
problem Miss Possible. After you saved us from that plague.&quot; 
  &quot;No big, just keep taking those tablets and you&#39;ll be fine.&quot; She 
glanced anxiously at the metal table in the middle of the room. &quot;You 
aren&#39;t going to try to probe me are you?&quot;
  &quot;We will not be doing that again.&quot; 
  Kim&#39;s eyes grew big and she asked, &quot;What do you mean &#39;again&#39;?&quot;

  Back at Ron&#39;s Kim and Ron collapsed onto the couch and stared up at 
the ceiling before saying anything. Then Ron said, &quot;I tell you KP, I 
like Rufus and all, but I never want my head stuck on his shoulders 
again.&quot; On Ron&#39;s shoulder Rufus shivered and squeaked his own disgust. 
  &quot;Yeah, what was kind of freaky: First she shrank people and animals to 
six inches high, then made them into Siamese twins. Remind me never to 
complain that my enemies aren&#39;t creative ever again.&quot; 
  &quot;I&#39;m just glad my parents were out of town incase we had to come home 
like that. You know, that cat she mixed you with had some moves.&quot;
  Kim scratched behind her ear and said, &quot;Yeah, it also had fleas.&quot;
  &quot;Once again, mad love for the hairless pet,&quot; Ron said and gave Rufus a 
high five. &quot;So who is making it to the party this year?&quot;
  &quot;Well there&#39;s you, my grandmother, Drakken, Shego, and the rest of my 
family.&quot;
  &quot;I always love the Possible Christmas bash. Not that I don&#39;t love 
Hanukkah but it is nice to do both, especially with you guys.&quot; 
  &quot;Hey Drakken&#39;s Jewish too.&quot;
  &quot;Yeah, and I have to say, he sings the Snowman Hank song with a lot of 
enthusiasm for a guy who spends most of the year trying to take over the 
world. I always wonder what he would do with the world if he ever 
actually took it over.&quot; 
  &quot;Shego slipped me some of his plans. Mostly there&#39;s a theme song 
called &#39;Drakken is great&#39; and the old &#39;I pledge allegiance to Dr. 
Drakken...&#39; She thinks he is probably just goofing around until his 
mother dies so that if he ever wins he won&#39;t have to explain how he took 
over the world.&quot;
  &quot;Speaking of Shego, how is that going to go this year?&quot; 
  &quot;Good question. She&#39;s been pressuring me to tell everyone. She says as 
long as we don&#39;t tell Drakken about the deal I have set up with her than 
she can simply beat him up until he stops complaining.&quot; 
  &quot;That could work.&quot;
  &quot;Sure, for her. What am I going to do? My brothers tease me for weeks 
if I get a zit. This...&quot; 
  &quot;Kim, what can I say? I&#39;ll stand by you no matter what.&quot; 
  &quot;You freaked out too Ron,&quot; she said. 
  Ron smiled nervously and said, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll admit it. I may have taken 
it badly.&quot; 
  &quot;You passed out in the bushes outside of an Italian restaurant that 
was actually in Italy.&quot;
  &quot;I was surprised. Besides, when we were dating I had no clue that you 
even might be...&quot;
  &quot;Well neither did I! It just happened Ron. We had a lot in common and 
when we were training together we just got to know each other and it 
just happened.&quot;
  &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have danced with her. That is the big no-no.&quot; 
  Kim groaned and covered her face. &quot;I know, okay? I know. That&#39;s how I 
ended up dating you, remember?&quot; 
  &quot;Yeah, but that lasted a week. It&#39;s been six months with Shego and...&quot;
  &quot;And it&#39;s serious.&quot;
  &quot;Besides, what if you two break up later and you decide you still like 
girls? It&#39;s going to come up sometime.&quot;
  &quot;Yeah, but couldn&#39;t she have picked a better time? Like when I could 
do it one at a time maybe? Or like Drakken, couldn&#39;t I have just waited 
until my parents were dead?&quot; 
  Rufus squeaked something and Ron said, &quot;He&#39;s right KP. This is Shego 
we&#39;re talking about here. She probably wants to see you squirm.&quot;
  &quot;She&#39;s seen me squirm,&quot; Kim said. Both of them blushed. &quot;Forget I said 
that.&quot; 
  &quot;No way.&quot; 

  Christmas Eve came and found Kim and Ron sitting on the couch. Jim and 
Tim had control of the television and as Ron wasn&#39;t allowed to plug in 
his &quot;Snowman Hank&quot; DVD they had it turned to the movie &quot;It&#39;s a giant 
fighting robot Christmas&quot;. Santa and his elves had just completed their 
Reindeer-robot with the super destruction red nose laser cannon when 
they were attacked by Cold Miser and his giant freeze ray. 
  &quot;Heat Miser couldn&#39;t beat me and you don&#39;t have the ice cubes take 
me!&quot; Santa shouted. 
  &quot;We&#39;ll see about that fat man!&quot; 
  Kim sighed and stared at the door, tapping her foot on the floor. When 
the bell finally rang she sprang up and ran to open the door. &quot;I&#39;ve got 
it.&quot; 
  Grandma Possible stood on the steps. &quot;Why hello Kimberly, how are 
you?&quot;
  &quot;Grandma!&quot; She gave her grandmother a hug just before the twins ran up 
to do the same. 
  &quot;Hey grandma!&quot; 
  &quot;How was that typhoon? We saw on the news that you helped the 
survivors rebuild their homes.&quot;  
  She smiled at them and said, &quot;Nice try boys, but I deactivated your 
surveillance devices when I drove up.&quot;
  &quot;Oh man,&quot; they said and sulkily and went back to their show in time to 
see Santa crush an elf under his robot&#39;s hoof. 
  &quot;Kimberly will Shego be here again this year? Last time she promised 
to trade me my lemon square recipe for her brother&#39;s ginger cookies.&quot;
  &quot;I hear Mego keeps it in a specially made vault under the Go-Tower and 
that nobody outside the family has ever learned the secrets,&quot; Ron said 
in a whisper.
  Grandma smiled and said, &quot;I know. I&#39;ve tried to get it myself twice. I 
almost made it in last August. But after listening to him gloat about 
how great he was for the next three hours...&quot; She shuddered. 
  Mr. And Mrs. Possible peeked out of the kitchen. &quot;Mom!&quot; With that 
Grandma walked over to them and the three adults disappeared into the 
kitchen. Kim sagged a bit and headed towards the couch when the doorbell 
rang again. Automatically she opened it and saw Shego and Drakken 
standing there, their hovercraft parked on the curb. Drakken was just 
setting the alarm when Kim opened the door. Both of them had an armload 
of presents.
  &quot;Well Possible are you going to invite us in or not?&quot; Shego asked with 
a smirk. &quot;That stupid hovercraft doesn&#39;t have a heater and I&#39;m 
freezing.&quot; 
  &quot;Shego I had enough room for a heater or a lightning bolt generator,&quot; 
Drakken snapped. &quot;You weren&#39;t complaining in July when Miss Possible 
here cut through the power grid and I had to splice some wires from it 
to make our getaway.&quot; 
  &quot;In July it was ninety degrees!&quot; Shego took a deep breath. &quot;Anyway 
Princess, invite us in before I end up feeding Dr. D his presents.&quot; 
  Kim smiled and stepped aside. &quot;Sure, come on in.&quot;
  As they stepped across the threshold Grandma quickly dashed into the 
room and walked over to Shego. In a low voice reminiscent of Deep Throat 
she whispered. &quot;Did you get the merchandise?&quot; 
  Playing along Shego held up a plain brown envelope. &quot;Right here. Do 
you have the payment?&quot; Grandma held up an identical envelope. They 
switched and then Grandma possible quickly went back into the kitchen. 
  Drakken looked over Shego&#39;s shoulder and asked, &quot;Is that what I think 
it is?&quot; 
  Shego peeked inside, blocking him from seeing. &quot;This is it.&quot; She 
glanced at Drakken. &quot;And we&#39;ll talk later about jut some of the things 
you&#39;ll have to do just to eat them.&quot; 
  Pouting Drakken walked over to the couch and sat down. He glanced at 
Ron. &quot;Hello...&quot; Ron pointed to the nametag he was wearing. &quot;Mr. 
Stoppable.&quot; He glanced at the television and minutes later he and the 
twins were taking notes on possible construction ideas. 
  Shego grinned smugly and said, &quot;I told you. Find Drakken&#39;s buttons and 
he&#39;ll do anything.&quot;
  &quot;I believed you the first time you told me,&quot; Kim said. 
  &quot;Then why do I get the feeling that you haven&#39;t told your parents yet? 
I would have thought you would crack before today and tried to get it 
over with quickly.&quot; 
  Kim glared at her. &quot;You know, I don&#39;t ever hear you mention your 
parents.&quot; 
  &quot;And you won&#39;t hear it today,&quot; Shego said primly. &quot;If I were the type 
to be fair about this I wouldn&#39;t be working for a megalomaniac mad 
scientist.&quot; 
  &quot;You are so going to pay for this the next time we fight.&quot; 
  Shego reached out and ran a finger along Kim&#39;s jaw. &quot;Bring... it... 
on... princess...&quot; She drew out the last word into a slow hiss that gave 
Kim goose bumps. &quot;But you still have to tell them. Or are you not the 
girl who can do anything?&quot;  
  &quot;Fine, I will do it. But tomorrow, after the presents.&quot;
  &quot;Deal. I&#39;d hate to make Dr. D any bluer than he is.&quot; She smiled and 
added, &quot;So, I get to sleep in your room tonight?&quot; 
  Biting her lip Kim was saved from answering by Grandma&#39;s yell of, &quot;So 
that&#39;s it! That clever...&quot;
  &quot;I guess she found out the secret ingredient,&quot; Shego said. 
  &quot;What is it?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh no you don&#39;t Possible. I trade that information only for the most 
top secret files and devices.&quot; 
  Kim shrugged. &quot;I thought as much. I still remember when you and Junior 
went after that one cookie recipe.&quot; 
  &quot;You know that year I was actually invited to the Seniors&#39; Christmas 
party.&quot; Kim raised her eyebrows. &quot;It wasn&#39;t that great. The presents 
were, I&#39;ll admit, but the food was that prissy stuff they&#39;re always 
serving and I had to put up with Junior hitting on me. It was pretty 
much the same as those villain mixers I told you about.&quot; 
  &quot;Why did you put up with it?&quot; 
  &quot;A diamond the size of my eye.&quot; 
  Kim frowned. &quot;Wait a minute, was that the same diamond Drakken used in 
that light refractor of his to make that weather machine invisible?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, it was,&quot; growled Shego. &quot;And don&#39;t think I didn&#39;t make him pay 
for that.&quot; 
  They continued talking for nearly an hour before they were called in 
for dinner. Jim and Tim waited a whole five minutes before starting a 
boys versus girls food fight. Mrs. Possible tried to stop it up until a 
piece of Mr. Possible&#39;s potatoes hit her in the face. Then it was all 
out war until the women all managed to cover them in gravy. 
  &quot;No fair!&quot; Jim said. 
  &quot;You&#39;re all trained martial artists!&quot; Tim added.  
  Kim shrugged. &quot;So is Ron. Besides, you&#39;re all geniuses.&quot; A carrot 
bounced off her nose. &quot;Hey!&quot;  
  &quot;I don&#39;t remember agreeing to stop when we beat the boys.&quot; Shego 
scooped up a spoonful of cranberries. 
  &quot;I&#39;m out!&quot; Grandma and Kim&#39;s mom said at the same time. 
  Kim smirked and took a forkful of potatoes. They both eyed each other 
closely as muscles tensed. Everyone else scooted back from the table. 
Muscles tensed they watched carefully for any sign of weakness. Then at 
the same time they let fly. The two hunks of food collided in the air 
and fell. It was then that both of them also let loose with their other 
hand where they had both concealed a scoop of stuffing. Each took it 
full in the face, catching it in their mouths. Everyone stared for a 
moment and then they all burst out laughing. Rufus hopped out of Ron&#39;s 
pocket and began picking up scraps of food while the rest of them wiped 
off. 
  Kim reached over to Shego. &quot;Hold still, you have some onions in your 
hair.&quot; She plucked it out and then she and Shego cleaned off each 
other&#39;s faces without saying a word. After all of the times they had 
ended up hurling food at each other on their dates it was practically 
second nature. The next big excitement came when Drakken sneezed and 
corn flew everywhere. Everyone else was grossed out except Jim and Tim 
who cheered him on. 

  That night Kim lay on the floor of her room staring at the ceiling. 
After dinner they had gone to the living room to sing carols and play 
some games before they finally let Drakken and Ron put their DVD on. 
Everyone else had decided to retire early, since every year they always 
insisted on watching it five times in a row. Kim had offered Shego her 
bed and unsurprisingly Shego had taken it without a single complaint. Or 
a thank you for that matter. Not that she had minded seeing Shego change 
out of her usual outfit and into nothing but a nightshirt had not been 
worth it but there was such a thing as common courtesy. 
  What the hell do I see in her? Kim thought. 
  She was not even sure how the whole thing had happened. Shego was her 
most dangerous enemy. They had been fighting for years! Then a few 
months training together at some mystery temple in the mountains and now 
they were a whole lot more than friends. And they were not even friendly 
really. They still spent their time respectively beating each other up. 
Kim still had a scar from Shego knocking her through a plate glass 
window and she had sent Shego to prison three times in the last four 
months. 
  Was it just a physical thing? Maybe she had always had feelings for 
girls and Shego was just available at the time. After all, showing her 
how to dance had put the two of them into close physical contact and 
that was when Kim started thinking about it. But she had not actually 
made a move until they had been sparring for the last time at the 
temple. They had been trading blows and the next thing Kim knew she had 
Shego&#39;s calf in her hands. A quick squeeze, an embarrassed goodbye, and 
Shego had planted a kiss on her cheek before flying off and suddenly 
they were dating. Dance contests, meals out... real dates. Very 
romantic, eventually making out, kind of dates. Actually even their 
martial arts sessions generally ended that way. Instead of insults they 
hurled come-ons and innuendo. One thing led to another and eventually 
one of them ended up pinned under the other. It never affected their 
work of course. They had made sure of that with bets on whether or not 
Shego could escape, the loser paying for their next date. 
  Okay, so maybe it was more than just physical. And it sure as heck 
wasn&#39;t entirely Kim&#39;s idea. Shego was right in there with her the whole 
way. In fact, when she thought about it, Shego might have been in there 
for longer. Like when Kim had told Shego that green was the new black 
and the next time they had met Shego&#39;s new black jacket had been 
replaced with a green one. Then there were the pet names Shego had been 
using for a few years: Princess, Kimmy, and Miss Perfect... the list 
went on and on. And if you looked at them any other way it made no 
sense. Shego had repeatedly made it clear in several ways that she was 
not actually jealous of Kim and most of the names were the sort of thing 
poor people said to people who were rich and spoiled. Shego lived in 
much nicer places than Kim did and actually spent long years as a 
superhero in the Go-Tower. 
  Without warning green light flashed on and Kim saw Shego leaning over 
the edge of the bed, hand glowing. &quot;I can hear you moving around and I 
know you well enough to guess what you&#39;re thinking about.&quot;
  Kim smiled nervously and said, &quot;Well, I was thinking.&quot; 
  &quot;Worried about what you&#39;re going to tell everyone tomorrow?&quot; 
  &quot;Uh, not exactly. I hadn&#39;t gotten around to that yet. I was just 
wondering how this happened in the first place.&quot; She then added, &quot;I also 
couldn&#39;t help but think that you picked up on those dance moves I showed 
you awfully fast. I mean, you&#39;re good, but that was absolutely amazing.&quot; 
  &quot;What exactly are you insinuating?&quot; Shego asked. 
  &quot;Well, I was just wondering how long you had a thing for me. If maybe 
you had taken advantage of us being alone together to... maybe get to 
me?&quot; 
  Shego rolled her eyes. &quot;Ah, I see. You think I&#39;m trying to seduce you 
over to the dark side. I&#39;ve done such a wonderful job of that.&quot;
  &quot;Not at all. I do not think you were trying to get me on your side. I 
just think you might have been trying to get me.&quot; 
  Shego was quiet for a moment. Then she cautiously asked, &quot;What would 
make you think that?&quot; 
  Kim told her some of the things she had been thinking about and 
continued with, &quot;And then I was thinking that we have known each other 
for a long time and that if you felt this way about me before...&quot; 
  &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve dated a lot of guys over the years.&quot; 
  &quot;Me to, but what does that have to do with now?&quot; Shego did not respond 
so she kept going. &quot;And I was wondering what I would do if I had thought 
of it back then and I guess I would have just given up. But if I 
suddenly found myself alone with you on a mountain for a while I might 
try something. Like in that Adam Sandler movie where he convinces that 
girl that he can&#39;t read and let&#39;s her teach him.&quot;
  &quot;And if I were desperate enough to try something so lame?&quot; Shego 
sneered. 
  Kim looked away and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I might think it was kind of 
sweet. Of course I would never tell anyone but I would still think it 
was sweet.&quot; 
  Shego growled low in her throat and picked up one of Kim&#39;s pillows to 
scream into. When she was done she threw it into the headboard and 
hissed, &quot;Yes, alright, I did it! But I didn&#39;t think it would actually 
work! I mean, you were there and I thought, what the hell, I&#39;ll see if I 
can get her to dance with me. Then you did and it was great and then we 
started hanging out together and you took me to that dance club...&quot; The 
green light from her hand intensified. &quot;At the most I thought you were 
being nice and that I might be able to slip and cop a feel before you 
told me to get lost.&quot; 
  &quot;But then I didn&#39;t stop and instead I did a few things you wanted me 
to, right?&quot; 
  &quot;Something like that. I mean you&#39;re the one who started massaging my 
leg. So you can&#39;t go saying that it was all my doing. I&#39;ve never even 
felt this way about girls before.&quot;
  &quot;Me either... but why would you feel like this about me? I mean, come 
on, you&#39;ve tried to kill me dozens of times.&quot;
  &quot;Not really. Come on Kimmy, I can punch through solid steel and when I 
hit you the worst I&#39;ve done is knock you out. I&#39;ve had you unconscious 
and at my mercy dozens of times and incase you haven&#39;t noticed I&#39;m not 
Drakken and could have easily slaughtered you without waking you up to 
gloat. I may be a mercenary but I&#39;m not a murderer.&quot; 
  Kim giggled. &quot;Now I know how I got your brother&#39;s powers back so 
easily. During my prom you even tried to make me jealous with that 
goop-monster of Drakken&#39;s.&quot;
  &quot;How was I supposed to know you would take Stoppable?&quot; Shego made a 
sick face. &quot;I mean...&quot;
  &quot;Ron isn&#39;t that bad. He does stuff with me that has made everybody 
else I&#39;ve ever gone on a mission with wet themselves.&quot; 
  &quot;I&#39;ll give him points for courage and even blind luck,&quot; Shego 
admitted. &quot;But he is such a doof!&quot; 
  &quot;Okay, so he is. I dated him for a week and then just couldn&#39;t do it. 
Once you&#39;ve seen someone put chocolate sauce and sweet pickles on a naco 
it&#39;s really hard to kiss them again.&quot; 
  &quot;Yuck! I thought he topped himself when he mixed his cornbread, 
stuffing, cranberries, and potatoes at dinner.&quot; 
  &quot;Not by a long shot. I&#39;ve seen him eat things Rufus wouldn&#39;t touch.&quot; 
  &quot;You know, Drakken has a brain switching machine and I have to say the 
rat would probably make better use of the human body.&quot; 
  &quot;Wade and Ron have both suggested the same thing.&quot; 
  &quot;They did? So what stopped you?&quot;
  &quot;Rufus&#39;s certainty that he is the better species. He even once tried 
to convince us that in the future hairless mole rats are going to be the 
big burly top species on the planet.&quot;
  &quot;So much for that idea then. I&#39;d hate to see that freakish parallel 
world.&quot; 
  &quot;You were saying that you&#39;ve had a thing for me for a while now.&quot; 
  Shego blushed green and the glow from her hands dimmed. &quot;What of it?&quot; 
  &quot;It makes me feel a little good actually. I&#39;m always worrying I&#39;m not 
cute enough. Between that and Bonnie I sometimes drive myself overboard 
on the emotion scale.&quot; 
  &quot;From what you told me about this Bonnie girl she would make such a 
better evil overlord than Drakken.&quot; 
  &quot;Drakken&#39;s robots thought so too. She was made their queen for a day.&quot;
  &quot;Anyway, don&#39;t give me that crap. You know you&#39;re gorgeous. Not only 
that you&#39;re popular, assertive, and a self employed international agent. 
You know celebrities as something other than hostages and you&#39;re rich. 
You&#39;re Lara Croft without all the boring archaelogy stuff.&quot; 
  &quot;Yeah, and look at you. If you ignore the fact that you&#39;ll do almost 
anything for money and enjoy it, you&#39;re practically perfect.&quot; 
  &quot;Don&#39;t go taking the moral high ground here,&quot; Shego warned.
  &quot;Sorry, but you have to admit, without the evil thing this would be a 
lot easier.&quot; 
  &quot;You try working with my brothers for five years and resist the urge 
to punch heroes in the face whenever possible.&quot; 
  Kim held up her hands. &quot;Okay, I surrender. No more good versus evil 
stuff. It&#39;s Christmas after all.&quot; 
  &quot;Seriously though, why are you dating me?&quot;
  &quot;I like you, okay? When we&#39;re not actually fighting each other you&#39;re 
a lot like me, we&#39;re into the same things, and you&#39;re very pretty.&quot; 
  &quot;I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re just trying to convert me to good again.&quot; 
  &quot;That isn&#39;t it!&quot; Kim snapped. 
  Shego grinned and let her light go out entirely. In the dark she said, 
&quot;Then get off the floor and prove it to me.&quot; 
  &quot;What? Tonight? You mean...&quot; 
  &quot;You scared to go all the way little Kimmy?&quot; 
  Kim lay there, not moving for a moment. Then, just as Shego was about 
to roll over and go back to sleep, she suddenly felt a warm hand on her 
cheek. &quot;I am not afraid of anything... except giant bugs.&quot; 
  Shego smiled and guessed where Kim&#39;s head would be. Reaching out she 
felt hair and ran her fingers to the back of Kim&#39;s head. &quot;Merry 
Christmas Princess.&quot; She pulled Kim into a deep kiss. 
  As she ran her hand down Kim&#39;s back Shego gasped as she found that Kim 
had already shed her nightshirt. Her hand contacted nothing but warm 
skin. Before she had time to process this Kim moved forward, pushing 
Shego back into the mattress. Automatically the green skinned mercenary 
wrapped her legs around Kim&#39;s waist, which was also naked. Almost 
unconsciously she began rubbing her legs against Kim&#39;s.
  Kim responded ardently, slipping her tongue into Shego&#39;s mouth. She 
was pleased when she felt Shego return the favor and her nipples 
hardened against Shego&#39;s breasts. With a low moan she reached down and 
grabbed at the hem of Shego&#39;s shirt, pulling it up over her head. Once 
the offending garment was gone Shego lowered her arms around Kim&#39;s neck 
and pulled her fully onto her and the bed. 
  Putting her lips next to Kim&#39;s ear Shego whispered, &quot;Your skin feels 
like silk.&quot; When she started to suck on Kim&#39;s earlobe, burying her face 
in Kim&#39;s long hair and breathing in deeply. 
  Kim moaned and slipped her hand around Shego&#39;s back and forcefully 
pulled the two of them together, her right breast trapped between 
Shego&#39;s. Her free hand ran through Shego&#39;s hair, and down along her ribs 
and side until she could bury her fingers into the curve of Shego&#39;s ass. 
She jerked her hips forward causing them to slap against Shego&#39;s and 
both laughed as they were tickled by each other&#39;s pubic hair. 
  &quot;Oh, Kimmy likes it,&quot; Shego whispered. Not breaking skin contact she 
slid her hands over Kim&#39;s body until she planted them on the girl&#39;s 
shoulders, pushing her back. Kim felt momentarily disappointed until she 
felt the hands move to her breasts, softly massaging them. 
  Closing her eyes Kim moaned and said, &quot;Yes, Kimmy likes it a lot.&quot; 
  &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do this for so long.&quot; Kim gasped when she felt Shego&#39;s 
hair fall over her like a sheet and warm breath against her skin. Then 
one hand lifted Kim&#39;s breast up to the waiting lips. 
  &quot;That feels so good,&quot; Kim breathed out, her back arching as she pushed 
herself into Shego&#39;s eager mouth. Deftly using a trick she learned from 
a contortionist at a circus she lifted one of her legs free from between 
Shego&#39;s and brought it around to clamp down on Shego&#39;s. Pushing her own 
up against Shego&#39;s crotch and began rubbing herself along the other 
girl&#39;s thigh.
  Shego responded with emphatic wiggles and even took a breath to switch 
breasts, taking Kim&#39;s nipple gently between her teeth. Then with a 
standard martial arts movement she flipped both of them over until she 
was on top. In the dim light coming through the window from the 
streetlamp outside she saw Kim looking up at her in the dark and 
smiling.
  She paused for a moment, simply staring down into Kim&#39;s eyes. It was 
such an odd sensation, having someone trust her like this. Nobody else 
ever had, even when she was a good guy. She opened her mouth to say 
something, but closed it again, not sure what she was going to say. 
  &quot;I love you too Shego,&quot; Kim said. 
  Shego stared at her and then said, &quot;Yeah, well don&#39;t get mushy on me 
Possible. Just because I love you doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t totally kick your 
ass.&quot; 
  Kim grinned and quickly moved both of her hands to Shego&#39;s rump, 
cupping both cheeks in her palms and lifting. &quot;We&#39;ll discuss the kinky 
stuff later.&quot; 
  Her nipples tightening Shego grinned and slide off of Kim&#39;s body. 
While Kim watched Shego leaned in and began to kiss her way down Kim&#39;s 
neck, stopping only to flick out her tongue or suck a patch of skin 
every few inches. Kim flinched when Shego suddenly bit down and sucked 
hard enough to leave a hickey, but she neither pulled away nor asked her 
to stop. 
  Taking the encouragement Shego worked her way down Kim&#39;s body doing 
the same thing. Kim twitched beneath her, muscles tensing everywhere. 
Shego slowed at her stomach and pressed her palms into the flesh on 
either side of Kim&#39;s belly button before slipping her tongue into it. 
Kim arched under her and her breath began to speed up. A smell reached 
Shego&#39;s nose that made her completely forget about everything else and 
she moved down the final few inches. 
  Turning her hands on so that they only glowed and would not cause 
damage, Shego was finally able to see what she had been working for. 
Kim&#39;s pussy was already very wet. It glistened in the neon green light 
and even moved a little as in embarrassment Kim tightened a few muscles. 
A small clit stuck up out of it like a button. 
  Shego reached out and ran her finger over that tiny bump like it was 
one of Kim&#39;s nipples and smiled as Kim&#39;s hips jerked up. Kim reached 
down and placed her hands on Shego&#39;s shoulders, squeezing hard, but 
trying not to make a sound. With a wicked gleam in her eye Shego decided 
to see if she could test that resolve. She pressed glowing fingers into 
the damp flesh and hair, rubbing in to it with her thumb and working the 
edges until it opened up like a flower petal. Then she used the thumb 
from each hand and pressed it into either side. Looking up so that she 
could see Kim&#39;s face she spread it open and leaned in. Kim&#39;s jaw fell 
open, her lower lip quivering. And then Shego took a deep breath and 
blew it inside. 
  Kim&#39;s entire body seemed to explode. The feel of Shego&#39;s hands on her 
crotch had been intense, but the soft cool air touching inside her sent 
her over the edge. Writhing in pleasure she spread her legs wide and bit 
down on her lip to keep from screaming. Then it got better as she felt 
Shego begin to softly kiss her there, tongue flicking out only for a 
second each time. Teeth tugged at her skin and clit, nipping softly. And 
then finally, she felt Shego plunge her tongue all the way inside. Kim 
had lost her virginity already, but she hadn&#39;t really enjoyed it and she 
had broken up with the guy the next day. This on the other hand, was an 
entirely different kettle of fish. 
  Shego&#39;s tongue felt like it was alive. She licked and sucked at Kim 
like an ice cream cone. Unsure if she could stop herself and damned sure 
she didn&#39;t want to, Shego kept it up until she felt Kim&#39;s neither lips 
clamp down around her tongue in a series of almost violent spasms. Then 
everything in Kim&#39;s body seemed to relax at once and she simply lay 
there while Shego made sure to clean off every last drop. 
  Suddenly she felt a stab of pain from her head. Looking up she saw 
that Kim had wrapped her fingers in Shego&#39;s hair and was firmly tugging 
her upwards. Shego went willingly, surprised to see Kim take control so 
forcefully. She got a bigger surprise when Kim let go and immediately 
moved that same hand down between Shego&#39;s leg to first rub her palm 
against Shego&#39;s entire vagina and then with no other warning she slid 
first one, then two fingers inside. 
  &quot;Slower,&quot; Shego gasped, her body stiffening. &quot;I&#39;m not ready for that 
yet.&quot; 
  Kim smiled and began to wiggle her fingers and ran her thumb over 
Shego&#39;s clit, which was almost two full inches long. With her free hand 
Kim pushed Shego back so that her head lay at the foot of the best. Next 
she slowly but firmly began to force her fingers in and out of the tight 
hole, ignoring the tight fit. Shego was already wet enough that 
lubrication was not a problem. 
  Shego&#39;s eyes had closed and she lay back in silence, her entire body 
shaking. It felt so incredible that she wanted to throw her head back 
and scream, but Kim had controlled herself and she was not about to give 
Kim the satisfaction of making her cry out. But then there was an odd 
noise and Shego opened her eyes strictly out of curiosity. Looking down 
she saw that Kim had reached into her nightstand. Unfortunately she 
couldn&#39;t focus long enough to turn on her glow and couldn&#39;t see what it 
was. But when something clicked in the dark and there was a soft buzzing 
sound, she was willing to take a guess. 
  &quot;I... I can&#39;t believe you have one of those.&quot; 
  Kim shook her head and said, &quot;I&#39;m eighteen Shego. And over the last 
half a year I&#39;ve had a lot of time to think about this. Just like you 
obviously have.&quot; To Shego&#39;s regret she suddenly pulled her other hand 
back too. In the dark Shego listened and tried to focus on what Kim was 
doing. There was the sound of her licking her fingers off and taking 
something else out of the drawer and then a lid coming off. Next came a 
wet squeaking sound like someone rubbing wet rubber. Shego managed a dim 
glow and in the light she saw Kim&#39;s hands glistening from some kind of 
gel that she was spreading over the small vibrator in her hand. It was 
only five inches long and an inch wide. 
  Kim grinned at her and said, &quot;No peeking.&quot; Shego immediately shut off 
the light and lay back, eyes closed and breath quickening while she 
waited. She did not have to wait long. Slimy hands pressed into her 
thighs, spreading her legs open. Then she felt the slick tip push into 
her. It was slightly smaller than Kim&#39;s fingers had been so it went in 
easily, but the humming vibrations hit her like a sledgehammer. 
  Kim leaned forward fast and kissed Shego just in time to muffle the 
sudden squeals that she had produced. Feeling incredibly embarrassed 
that she had not been able to hold out, Shego took advantage of her 
sudden freedom to make as much noise as possible. She jerked and moved 
while Kim deftly silenced her and maneuvered the vibrator. She came once 
then twice and finally a third time, grabbing Kim&#39;s arms hard enough to 
leave marks. Then she collapsed backwards and Kim clicked off the 
vibrator before slowly pulling it out. 
  There was a thump to the side as Kim, also feeling exhausted, dumped 
her toy to the side. Lifting herself up on her hands Kim hovered over 
Shego, letting her hair moved across her lover&#39;s neck. &quot;Was that what 
you wanted?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; Shego said. Forcing her movements she sat up and kissed Kim 
again. 
  Kim responded by pulling Shego into a hug and then laying the both of 
them back on the pillow side by side. Shego pulled the blankets up to 
cover them and in the dark they laced their arms around one another and 
just lay holding each other. 
  &quot;Merry Christmas Princess,&quot; Shego whispered.
  Kim smiled and kissed Shego softly on the forehead. &quot;And to all a good 
night.&quot; 

  In the morning they were woken by a loud knock on the door. The voice 
of Kim&#39;s dad came through, &quot;Kim, you and your friend need to wake up. 
It&#39;s time to open presents and Drakken is getting impatient.&quot; 
  Kim yawned and said, &quot;We&#39;ll be right out dad. I&#39;ll just wake up Shego 
and we&#39;ll get dressed.&quot; 
  &quot;Okay Hun!&quot; 
  &quot;Like you need to wake me up,&quot; Shego groaned against Kim&#39;s shoulder. 
  Kim drew back and said, &quot;Whoa, talk about morning breath.&quot; 
  &quot;Yeah, well it must have been someone I ate,&quot; she snapped. &quot;And yours 
isn&#39;t much better. Come on, we have to get up. Drakken is such a baby if 
he had to wait to open presents.&quot;
  They got up and went to Kim&#39;s bathroom. Side by side they brushed 
their teeth, used some mouthwash. Then they decided to take a quick 
shower together. It did not take too long, even though they washed each 
other&#39;s backs because they were still a little sore from the night 
before and neither of them wanted to put up with Drakken. On top of that 
it was only sixty-five degrees inside the house and when they got out of 
the shower it felt like stepping into ice. They toweled off and brushed 
out their hair before changing into pants and sweaters. Glancing in the 
mirror Kim decided to also put on the scarf her grandmother had made for 
her. Not just because her grandmother would like it, but also because it 
made it easier to hide the huge hickey that Shego had left on her neck. 
  &quot;You know, I could see doing this in the mornings,&quot; Shego said.
  Kim grinned and said, &quot;I know what you mean. You wake up and head out 
to work on whatever Drakken has for you and then I go out to stop my 
villain of the day, and unless it&#39;s you I&#39;m sending to prison and I end 
up sleeping alone, then we both come home and enjoy a movie or 
something?&quot; 
  &quot;Or something,&quot; Shego agreed. 
  &quot;On the other hand I did arrange a deal with a secret organization 
that I happen to know so that as long as you stick to property damage 
and our deal that Drakken never actually wins, you don&#39;t have to go to 
prison for more than a month.&quot; 
  &quot;A deal? You mean you don&#39;t trust me not to help takeover the world 
and keep you as my personal servant?&quot; Kim looked at her. &quot;Okay, maybe 
I&#39;ve considered it. I&#39;m a bad girl.&quot; She kissed Kim. 
  &quot;Come on, let&#39;s head downstairs for presents and embarrassing 
revelations...&quot; At that moment there was an incredibly loud explosion 
and the entire house shook. &quot;Oh no, did Drakken bring something 
explosive for the twins this time?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I don&#39;t think so... did your brothers give him something 
explosive?&quot; 
  They ran out of the room and down the stairs. The living room was in a 
shambles. One of the walls was a gaping hole, obviously blasted from the 
outside. Singed and broken presents were scattered under a trashed 
Christmas tree. There were no people. 
  Kim bent down and saw the broken Snowman Hank DVD lying on the floor. 
&quot;Well, we know Drakken didn&#39;t do this.&quot; 
  &quot;So who did?&quot; 
  &quot;I don&#39;t know, but if they&#39;ve harmed one hair on any member of my 
family...&quot; 
  &quot;What is that?&quot; Shego pointed to a spot on the ceiling. 
  Kim looked up and saw a spot of green gunk hanging from the ceiling. A 
drop fell down and splashed in a piece of mistletoe lying on the floor. 
Suddenly the tiny plant grew eyes and legs and then scuttled under the 
couch. &quot;Gill.&quot; 
  On her waist Kim&#39;s communicator beeped and she picked it up. &quot;Hey 
Wade.&quot; 
  &quot;Hi Kim, I managed to make the call after all.&quot; Wade grinned from his 
screen. &quot;Merry Christmas.&quot; 
  &quot;Thanks Wade, but I&#39;ve got problems. As near as I can tell Gill just 
kidnapped my family on Christmas.&quot; 
  &quot;Seriously? Whoa, that sucks. I&#39;ll check with some satellites and see 
if I can get a fix on any large toxic spills in the area.&quot; He pressed a 
few buttons. &quot;Okay, it looks like there&#39;s an old factory on the edge of 
town that was closed down last year by the EPA. Strangely enough it is 
up and running.&quot; 
  &quot;Bingo. Fastest way to get Shego and me there?&quot; 
  &quot;Are your presents still there?&quot; She nodded. &quot;Check for two with large 
red and white stripes. They were for you and Ron, but knowing what Gill 
is likely to do to him I doubt he&#39;ll mind lending it out.&quot; 
  Shego was already moving and tosses Kim one of the two boxes. They 
ripped them open and she whistled when what was inside telescoped out. 
&quot;Nice, rocket powered scooters.&quot; 
  &quot;They&#39;re a new model,&quot; Wade said. 
  &quot;Thanks Wade. What&#39;s the address?&quot; He told her. &quot;Great. Enjoy your 
holidays.&quot; 
  Shego led the way out the door and the two of them headed out on the 
scooters. &quot;I have to say, you get some nice equipment Possible.&quot; 
  &quot;I have good genetics,&quot; She said. 
  &quot;So who is this Gill guy?&quot; 
  &quot;He&#39;s a mutant that Ron went to summer camp with. He keeps showing up 
and trying to turn the whole world into mutants. He spits that gunk we 
saw at the house.&quot;
  &quot;Ew! Okay, so don&#39;t let him spit on us. Anything else?&quot; 
  &quot;Well this is the first time I&#39;ve seen him blow anything up. But no, 
mostly he just tries to eat Ron and turn people into mutants.&quot; 
  &quot;Every time? Talk about lack of originality.&quot; 
  &quot;That&#39;s what I said... we&#39;re here.&quot; They pulled up near the factory 
and stared up at the billowing smoke. &quot;Why doesn&#39;t anybody ever notice 
these things?&quot; 
  Both of them made their way to the windows and peered inside. As 
expected, the entire family, Drakken, and Ron were stuck to the wall in 
cocoons of green slime. The twins were already mutating, probably 
because they were smaller. 
  &quot;Whoa, look at this!&quot; Jim stuck out a foot long forked tongue. 
  &quot;Ha, check this out!&quot; Tim&#39;s tongue flicked out like a toad&#39;s and then 
snapped back in. 
  Mrs. Possible groaned. &quot;Boys, stop doing that.&quot; Suddenly her skin 
began to turn scaly. &quot;Oh no! I hope my salon can handle this.&quot; 
  Gill was pacing in front of them dressed in a bright red Santa suit. 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, when I&#39;m through with all of you the whole world is going 
to be mutants. And this time nobody can stop me...&quot; He paused and said. 
&quot;Wait a minute, somebody is missing.&quot; 
  Ron said, &quot;No, we&#39;re all here. See, there&#39;s me, Rufus, and everyone 
else.&quot; 
  &quot;No... Kim Possible and Shego... where are they?&quot;
  &quot;Back at the house. They were taking their own sweet time coming 
downstairs,&quot; Drakken said. &quot;Why are you doing this to me? I&#39;m a bad guy 
too.&quot;
  &quot;A bad guy who was with my archenemies during the holidays? Yeah, 
right. Besides, I&#39;ve stolen the equipment of the lab they were keeping 
me in and I&#39;ve been monitoring all of you for weeks. From what I&#39;ve seen 
at the very least your little mercenary hasn&#39;t been doing her job.&quot; 
  Kim and Shego ducked down behind the wall. &quot;Okay, we need a plan.&quot; 
  &quot;We have to catch him off guard. Now.&quot; She thoughts fast and then 
looked down at her wrist. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve still got the holographic bracelet 
you gave me, but it&#39;s only good for clothing.&quot; 
  &quot;Okay, let&#39;s see what I have.&quot; She pulled a few things out of her 
pockets. &quot;All I have is my laser lipstick.&quot; 
  &quot;Kimmy, we have a whole factory in there. Let&#39;s just get inside and 
kick his ass.&quot;
  &quot;I like it.&quot; 

  Gill was showing Drakken photos of Kim handing Shego some envelopes 
when there was a loud knock on the factory doors. &quot;Open up! I&#39;m here 
from the EPA.&quot; 
  Gill grinned and rubbed his claws together. &quot;Oh boy, I love it when 
these guys show up.&quot; He stalked towards the door and opened it. Looking 
down he saw the white uniform and hat of an EPA official. &quot;You wanted to 
talk to me?&quot;
  Shego looked up and the hologram turned off. Gill took a step back in 
surprise. &quot;Talk? No.&quot; Her hand started glowing and she punched up, 
snapping the mutant&#39;s head backwards. Gill roared and began spitting at 
her. Shego dodged it expertly, but wasn&#39;t able to get close enough to 
attack. 
  &quot;Hey Gill, heads up,&quot; Kim called. Gill turned to look and got a boot 
to the face as Kim, after sneaking in through a window, swung down from 
one of the rafters on her scarf. &quot;Thanks for the scarf grandma.&quot; 
  &quot;You&#39;re welcome Kimberly.&quot; 
  &quot;Jim, Tim, catch!&quot; She flicked the laser lipstick over to her 
brothers, Tim snagged it out of the air with his tongue and Jim used his 
to pick it up and turn it on. Seconds later he had cut through the green 
slime holding them all to the walls. 
  &quot;No!&quot; Gill screamed and began charging them. Drakken reached into his 
lab coat and pulled out a vial. Gill saw it and spit on his hand, 
sealing it in. &quot;Ha!&quot;
  Something tapped him on the back. He turned and got punched by the 
entire Possible family at once. Ron was behind him and as he staggered 
back he stuck out a foot making the mutant hit the concrete floor of the 
factory. Shego was suddenly standing above him, cracking her knuckles. 
Gill whimpered just before the beating began. 
  Several minutes later Drakken&#39;s hand was free and he was holding out 
his vial again. Mr. Possible looked at him and asked, &quot;What&#39;s that 
Drew?&quot; 
  &quot;It&#39;s some anti-mutagen I keep on me.&quot; 
  &quot;You just happen to have that?&quot; 
  Drakken frowned. &quot;The last time I didn&#39;t I turned blue.&quot; With a flick 
of his wrist he splashed a drop on everyone and they immediately 
returned to normal. Gill was unconscious on the ground, but he too was 
human again. &quot;There, I told you I was a genius, didn&#39;t I?&quot; He put it 
away. 
  Kim nodded and said, &quot;I&#39;ll make a call to have Gill picked up.&quot;
  &quot;There is one thing I have to know,&quot; Drakken said. He turned to Shego. 
&quot;This mutant has shown us some interesting photographs Shego and you 
have some explaining to do.&quot; 
  &quot;Dr. D I...&quot; 
  &quot;Just how many recipes have you traded Kim Possible for? I saw the 
envelopes, just like yesterday. And I want to know why you haven&#39;t 
offered me any.&quot; 
  Rolling her eyes Shego said, &quot;I&#39;m saving them. But how about this: 
when we get back to the lair I&#39;ll make a batch of grandma Possible&#39;s 
lemon squares.&quot; 
  Drakken frowned and then said, &quot;Alright.&quot; He stalked forward, 
attempting to maintain his cool and not smile too wide. &quot;Now, let&#39;s go 
open what remains of our presents.&quot; 
  Shego went with him. &quot;We&#39;ll see you back at the house.&quot; 
  The Possibles started after him. Grandma said, &quot;That is one weird 
man.&quot; 
  &quot;I miss my new tongue,&quot; Jim said. 
  Tim nodded. &quot;Me too. Dad, on our birthday can we mutate again?&quot; 
  &quot;We&#39;ll see boys.&quot; He paused and glanced at Kim. &quot;Honey, what is that 
on your neck?&quot; 
  Kim&#39;s hand shot up to cover it. &quot;Uh...&quot; Well, things could not get any 
worse. &quot;It&#39;s a hickey.&quot; 
  Mrs. Possible&#39;s eyebrows rose up. &quot;Is there something you want to tell 
us?&quot; 
  Ron put a hand on her shoulder. &quot;Might as well KP.&quot; 
  Kim sighed. &quot;Okay, fine. In between beating her and Drakken I&#39;m kind 
of... dating Shego.&quot; 
  &quot;Cool,&quot; the twins said. 
  &quot;What? You aren&#39;t going to tease me about it?&quot; Kim asked. 
  &quot;Are you kidding? Shego is awesome!&quot; Jim said. 
  Tim nodded. &quot;She has superpowers!&quot; 
  &quot;And did you see her beating up on the fish man?&quot;
  &quot;Can you introduce us to her brothers?&quot; 
  Kim glanced at her parents. Mrs. Possible smirked back and said, &quot;Kim 
we already knew.&quot; 
  &quot;You did?&quot; 
  &quot;Honey, I&#39;m a rocket scientist,&quot; Mr. Possible said. &quot;It was not that 
hard to figure out. Last night we watched you two at dinner and had a 
long talk about it.&quot; 
  She glanced at her grandmother who smiled and said, &quot;When I was your 
age I had a thing for a South American kingpin. Sadly I had to have him 
thrown into jail for fifty years, but until then we were a hot couple.&quot; 
She frowned a bit. &quot;Though I don&#39;t understand all these same sex couples 
these days, it is fairly obvious that you two are good together.&quot; 
  &quot;And it&#39;s not like they go easy on each other in a fight either,&quot; Ron 
said. &quot;Actually since they started betting on who would win they kick 
butt even better.&quot; 
  &quot;You guys are the best,&quot; Kim said. She hugged her family. &quot;Come on, 
let&#39;s get back home before Drakken opens our presents too. You guys go 
on ahead. I&#39;ll be right behind you.&quot; 
  Once they were gone she used her scarf to tie Gill up tightly and then 
made her way home. When she got there it turned out that Wade had 
already called a crew in to fix the house. Inside everyone was opening 
presents. Walking in the door Shego tossed one to Kim and they all 
stopped while she opened it. Inside was a simple gold necklace. 
  &quot;I paid for it,&quot; Shego said quickly. She got up and walked over. While 
Drakken was looking behind the tree for more boxes, she took the 
necklace and put it on Kim&#39;s neck. &quot;Hey, look up there.&quot; 
  Kim glanced up and saw that the mutant mistletoe from earlier had 
crawled up onto the ceiling and was looking down at them. Kim grinned 
and glanced back at Shego. &quot;Well, it is a tradition.&quot; 
  Shego leaned in for a kiss. When they broke up she asked, &quot;So was it 
as bad a day as you were expecting?&quot; 
  &quot;No way, it was actually way better.&quot; 
  Drakken stared at them and said, &quot;Did those two just...&quot; He was 
interrupted when the mistletoe jumped down and grabbed onto his face. 
&quot;Ah! Get it off! Get it off!&quot; 

The end.

lemon version I might be able to send it to you.
