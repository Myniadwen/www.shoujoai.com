the Stane compound, the black haired woman looking
over at Warbird thoughtfully.

Warbird shrugged, the slim blonde superheroine
frowning to herself slightly. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she
admitted, I think Ms. Stane is talking a good game,
but I wish I could be sure she meant it.&quot;

&quot;She seemed sincere to me,&quot; Jackie said honestly, &quot;as
did her friend, Jennifer.&quot;

Warbird gave her a thoughtful look, &quot;Maybe so. I was a
bit surprised to see you here in your civilian
identity, though.&quot;

Jackie smiled wryly as she gently reminded her, &quot;I did
sort of get involved in a battle in the middle of LA.&quot;
She shrugged as she continued, &quot;If someone wants to
find out who Thunderstike really is, they probably
can.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Warbird said quietly. She hesitated a moment
then continued, &quot;It occurs to me that I never even
thanked you for helping me.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Jackie said warmly, brown eyes
twinkling.

Warbird felt a blush color her cheeks, though she
couldn&#39;t quite explain why. &quot;I have a friend who&#39;s a
private eye,&quot; she changed the subject, &quot;I&#39;ll ask her
to look into Stane for me. If she&#39;s clean, I may sign
on with this group she&#39;s forming, if only to keep an
eye on her.&quot;

&quot;My own motives aren&#39;t nearly so noble,&quot; Jackie
admitted, &quot;I need the job.&quot;

Warbird laughed, and then took a step backwards as
Jackie drew her battered mace from her bag. Raising it
above her head she slammed the handle to the ground
and in a burst of light and sound was transformed.
Thunderstrike&#39;s red cloak swirled around her, her blue
chain mail shirt hugging her body, the Asgardian garb
giving her a slightly more impressive appearance.

Spinning her mace Thunderstrike said, &quot;You might want
to look into my background too, before you decide if
we&#39;re going to be allies.&quot; Tossing the mace she
grabbed at the attached chain grip and soared off,
much like Thor once had.

&#39;What did she mean by that?&#39; Warbird blinked, smoothly
rising into the sky as she headed towards LA. A half
an hour later Carol Danvers arrived in her new
apartment, boxes of stuff still scattered around,
waiting to be unpacked. Ignoring them she headed to
the phone and dialed, hoping her friend would still be
up.

&quot;Whatever it is had better be good,&quot; the annoyed voice
said.

&quot;Jess,&quot; Carol grinned, &quot;good to hear from you, too.&quot;

&quot;Do you know what time it is here in New York?&quot;
Jessica Jones asked crossly.

Carol&#39;s eyes widened, quickly realizing it was even
later back east. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said a bit sheepishly,
&quot;I forgot.&quot;

&quot;One of these days...,&quot; Jessica trailed off with a
tired sigh. A bit more gently she asked, &quot;So what&#39;s
up, buddy?&quot;

&quot;Actually I have a job I need you to do,&#148; Carol
confessed. &quot;Background checks on Olivia Stane,&quot; she
hesitated and added, &quot;and Jackie Lucas.&quot; She spelled
the names out then added, &quot;Whatever you can get in a
day or so, send to my email address.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get some internet searches going and hit up some
of my contacts,&quot; Jess agreed, &quot;but I can&#39;t promise too
much in a short time.&quot;

&quot;Whatever you can get would help,&quot; Carol said
thoughtfully, &quot;I think that is there&#39;s something odd,
it&#39;ll come up pretty fast.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Jess nodded. &quot;So how are you doing?&quot; she
asked gently.

&quot;I&#39;m coping,&quot; Carol said, &quot;losing my old job and
everything that happened... it&#39;s been hard.&quot; She
brightened, &quot;And how&#39;s pregnancy treating you?&quot;

&quot;Luke&#39;s discovering the wonders of living with someone
with morning sickness,&quot; Jess said with amusement. They
talked for a bit then Jess said, &quot;Well, I&#39;ve got to
get to bed, I&#39;ll have some info for you as soon as
possible.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Carol finished with a grin.



Earlier at the Stane Complex two women watched using
the security systems as Warbird and Jackie talked, and
then the two heroines took off in different
directions. Olivia Stane switched the monitor off as
the white haired woman asked, &quot;Do you think they&#39;ll
sign on?&quot;

Jennifer Swensen leaned on the corner of Olivia&#39;s
desk, her red hair flowing over her shoulders.
&quot;Warbird will check into us,&quot; Jen said confidently,
&quot;but once she finds out we&#39;re clean, I think she&#39;ll go
for it.&quot;

&quot;And Thunderstrike?&quot; Olivia asked.

&quot;She&#39;s having difficulty finding employment due to her
criminal past,&quot; Jen pointed out, &quot;she needs this job,
honestly.&quot; A smile, &quot;And she&#39;s serious about being a
hero, no matter how difficult it&#39;s made her life.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Olivia got up, a soft groan coming from her
throat as she stretched, her breasts pushing up
against her dress top. &quot;You&#39;ll tell me if you have any
problems in the War Machine?&quot; as asked as she and Jen
walked out of the office.

Jen casually shut the lights off, and then followed up
the hall. &quot;You don&#39;t need to worry,&quot; she said gently,
&quot;I helped design the suit, and I know what it can do.&quot;

Olivia hit the switch for the elevator, waving Jen on
in before following her inside. &quot;I know all that,&quot; she
admitted as she used her key to access the penthouse
floor switch, &quot;but I&#39;m going to worry about you
anyway.&quot;

They rose smoothly towards the penthouse level as Jen
looked down at the smaller woman, &quot;If you really don&#39;t
want me to pilot the suit...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Olivia shook her head, &quot;you&#39;re right in trying
to keep the suit in the hands of someone we both
trust.&quot; A smile, &quot;Even if it scares me.&quot;

The doors of the elevator opened to the penthouse, a
spacious set of rooms that Olivia had added shortly
after buying the building. They walked in together and
Jen slipped her business suit jacket off as she
smiled, &quot;Who&#39;s turn is it for dinner tonight?&quot;

&quot;Mine,&quot; Olivia smiled as she slipped her heels off,
wiggling her toes in the luxurious carpet. &quot;Do you
have anything you&#39;d like?&quot; she asked.

Jennifer came up behind her and slipped her arms
around Olivia, &quot;You.&quot;

&quot;Bad girl,&quot; Olivia laughed softly as she wiggled free.
She gave Jen a fond look, &quot;You have to eat some real
food, not that engineer&#146;s junk food I see you snack
on.&quot;

Jennifer chuckled as she slipped her own shoes off,
&quot;Spoil sport.&quot; She padded after Olivia as they crossed
the massive living room to the kitchen, &quot;Where did you
get the habit of taking your shoes off coming home?&quot;

Olivia smiled fondly in memory, &quot;Japan, actually. I
attended school there for most of my teens, I thought
because my Father wanted me out of the way.&quot;

&quot;You thought?&quot; Jen raised an eyebrow, &quot;What was the
real reason?&quot;

Olivia opened the fridge to get out several foil
wrapped dishes as she said, &quot;By reading his diaries I
found out he was getting involved with the underworld
at the time, he shipped me off so I couldn&#39;t be used
against him.&quot;

&quot;Or to protect you,&quot; Jennifer played devil&#39;s advocate.

Olivia shrugged uncomfortably as she put the meatloaf
she had made earlier into the oven to heat, &quot;Either
way it really was a blessing in disguise. I think my
Japanese foster family was the best influence I ever
had.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you&#39;re going this?&quot; Jen asked as she
uncovered the noodles and put them in the microwave
for two minutes.

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I completely believe in the Japanese
traditions of honor,&quot; Olivia mused, &quot;but yes, I&#39;m
trying to make up for the sins of my father.&quot; A flash
of her smile, &quot;Not to mention the various cynical
reasons I have to do this.&quot;

&quot;You may sell your accountants on that, but it doesn&#39;t
fool me,&quot; Jennifer laughed as they leaned against
various counters, waiting for dinner to heat.

&quot;Pacifying the accountants and shareholders is a
necessary evil,&quot; Olivia chuckled, &quot;I don&#39;t think
they&#39;d be happy knowing I want to do good for it&#39;s own
sake.&quot;

Jennifer reached out to take Olivia&#39;s hand, gently
squeezing it in hers. &quot;I think that&#39;s part of why I
love you so,&quot; she said.

&quot;You just want to get out of eating diner, m&#39;love,&quot;
Olivia gave a delighted laugh.

&quot;No,&quot; Jennifer&#39;s voice was a purr, &quot;I&#39;m just looking
forward to what happens after dinner.&quot;

Olivia blushed fiercely.</pre>
