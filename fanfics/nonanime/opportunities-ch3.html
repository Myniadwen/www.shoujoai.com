<h1>Opportunities: A Tale of Civil War (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/opportunities-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The image of Tony Stark beamed from the tv screen as he said, &quot;The first 
graduates of the Camp Hammond training facility are being deployed to 
cities across amarica, and we&#39;re fulfilling our promise of a super team 
in every state.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, as long as we knuckle under to you,&quot; the redhead muttered as she 
flipped burgers in the cafe&#39;s kitchen. Tall and muscular she looked like 
a amazon, and Katrina Van Horn often lived up to the name.

&quot;Kat,&quot; the young blonde scolded as she carried dishes over to the sink.

The healer known as Fixer answered to the name Rio, but Kat didn&#39;t even 
know if that was really her name. &#39;Not my business, either,&#39; Kat added 
mentally before saying aloud, &quot;Sorry, I just have a hard time swallowing 
his crap.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Donnie Gill agreed, he now black haired man smiling wryly at 
his two employees. The owner of the caf&#130; had been the c-list villain the 
Blizzard until he reformed, joining a later version of the Thunderbolts 
and having his power granting suit destroyed.

Despite the risk to himself he offered them both employment in his small 
restaurant, very pointedly not asking about if they were registered ir 
not. Both Kat and Rio appreciated that, even though they didn&#39;t trust 
him a 100 yet.

&quot;You mind helping up front?&quot; Donnie asked, tossing Kat a towel to dry 
her hands.

Kat caught it easily, &quot;No prob.&quot;

The Last Chance caf&#130; was a odd little venue in New York city, frequented 
by those commonly on the wrong side of the law. B and C list villains 
came in for some food and conversation, paid up and went on their way, 
no doubt planning their next job.

&quot;Damn it, my eggs are runny,&quot; Cutthroat muttered, the assassin staring 
down at his plate of food in disgust.

&quot;That&#39;s how you ordered &#39;em,&quot; Kat reminded him dryly, looking at the 
costumed man in aggravation. &quot;What&#39;s with the suit?&quot; she demnded, &quot;Are 
you trying to get caught?&quot;

&quot;A professional,&quot; Cutthroat sniffed, &quot;must always be ready for action.&quot;

Kat was tempted to ask how his garish uniform might help him, but 
decided not to ask. Instead she moved through the busy caf&#130;, nodding 
greetings to familiar faces and filling up cups with coffee.

&quot;Here you go, sir,&quot; Kat said as she topped up a coffee. Judas Traveller 
calmly drank his coffee, the white haired psionic seemingly harmless in 
his corner seat. But locked within him were incredible mental gifts such 
as telepathy, telekinesis and other talents, all of which the 
Occasionally deranged man had used against Spider-Man.

&quot;Good brew,&quot; Judas said seriously.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kat smiled calmly.

Aaron Chord nodded respectfully as he held up his empty cup, and Kat 
hurried over to help him. Sometimes a criminal, sometimes a vigilante 
Aaron used the name Midnight&#39;s Fire, and controlled a crime empire on 
the mean streets if New York. &quot;Could I get some more toast?&quot; the 
ponytailed and brown skinned young man asked.

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; Kat said as she relayed the order to the cook, 
Victor.

Once called the Orator Victor Ludwig had tried to be a servant to 
Magneto, but in the end had been cast aside . Now he used his mutant 
gift to covince people the food was great, as well as occasionally 
showing girl a good time.

&quot;Patrick,&quot; Kat growled to the next customer, &quot;watch the hands before I 
take your stick and shove it where the sun don&#39;t shine.&quot;

Patrick Mahony held up his hands innocently, &quot;I didn&#39;t do northing!&quot;

&quot;I know you can control fabric, Ramrod,&quot; Kat said dryly to the mutant 
villain, &quot;so don&#39;t play dumb.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re no fun,&quot; Patrick sighed.

Rio shook her head in admiration as she watched from the kitchen as the 
older woman so easily handled the crowd. The Shocker, Puma, Stiletto and 
more ate out there, but Kat navigated the deadly waters with ease. &#39;I 
wish I could do that,&#39; she sighed.

The doorbell rang and Kat looked up in relief as their replacements 
arrived. &quot;Okay bodd,&quot; she nodded to Daniel, &quot;we&#39;re off.&quot;

&quot;Watch yourselves,&quot; he said as both women passed their aprons to Asp and 
the latest villain to call herself Snapdragon.

The two women walked casually towards the flop house they were staying 
in, keeping a wary eye out for the armored capehunters that SHIELD had 
been deploying. The country was a dangerous place for a unregistered 
super, as both Kat and Rio were well aware.

&quot;What do you think of the Hood?&quot; Rio wondered quietly.

Kat grimaced. The Hood was a formerly small time crook who saw the Civil 
War as a opportunity, assembling a army of hoods and plotting to take 
over crime in America. His agent John King had been recruiting, even 
approaching the customers of the Last Chance with offers of money and 
protection.

&quot;I don&#39;t want any part of it,&quot; Kat admitted as they walked along, her 
pants and coat shielding her from a cool breeze, &quot;even if he&#39;s 
successful, someone else will take him down.&quot;

Rio&#39;s skirt fluttered a bit as she slid closer to Kat. &quot;That&#39;s about 
what I thought,&quot; she agreed, &quot;which is why I turned him down.&quot; She 
frowned slightly in thought, &quot;But is there any way we can use this?&quot;

Kat fought back a grin, thinking how proud she was of her partner. When 
Kat had first rescued Rio she was a babe in the woods, despite her gang 
background. Now she was really developing some street savvy, and was 
doing a pretty good job of watching Kat&#39;s back too. &#39;I wonder if she&#39;s 
doing it because we&#39;re friends,&#39; Kat stole a look at the lovely blonde, 
&#39;or...?&#39;

&quot;Kat?&quot; Rio looked at her questioningly.

&quot;Heh, sorry,&quot; Kat shook herself. &quot;We could offer the info to the 
Avengers, but we&#39;d need to make sure it couldn&#39;t be traced back to us.&quot;

&quot;You got that right,&quot; Rio shuddered, &quot;I never want to be back in the 
Negative Zone prison ever again.&quot;

Kat reached out and tentatively put a arm over her shoulders 
comfortingly as she said to Rio, &quot;Me too.&quot;

Rio sighed softly and leaned into Kat&#39;s warmth, snuggling in close as 
they staggered a bit. &quot;You smell nice,&quot; Rio murmured, &quot;I like that.&quot;

Kat was about to say something when they heared sirens off in the 
distance, making both stiffen in alarm. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Kat lead them on a 
run for the flophouse, both women ducking out of sight as they watching 
for any sign of trouble.

&quot;Shit,&quot; the older man at the desk blinked as they raced in, &quot;what now?&quot;

Kat flashed him a comforting smile, &quot;Looks like something&#39;s going down 
and we want to get a good look.&quot;

&quot;Prob&#39;ly SHIELD and their damn armored fascists again,&quot; the manager 
muttered, &quot;I felt safer when Cap&#39;n America was still around.&quot;

&quot;You can say that again,&quot; Rio agreed softly.

They descended from the sky in black armor, bulky figures who carried 
frightening guns and looked ready to use them. Steel wings were mounted 
on their backs, the shape of the armor plating giving them a sinister 
look as they lined up in the street.

&quot;Robin Braxton,&quot; the lead agent yelled, &quot;aka Gladiatrix, you are 
required by law to register! If you refuse to comply, we are authorized 
to use whatever means needed.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;ll we do?&quot; Rio whispered as they waited for the woman to appear.

&quot;If they rush in here,&quot; Kat shrugged, &quot;fight.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Rio agreed after a moment, her expression grim.

&quot;All right squad,&quot; the chief agent started... just as a head of lettuce 
hit him in the head.

&quot;Get outta here!&quot; a old lady yelled from a upper story, &quot;Go on!&quot;

A tomato soared out another window, then eggs began to pelt down. The 
armored SHIELD agents looked confused as people all over the street 
began to pitch items down on them, emptying trash bins and covering them 
in filth.

&quot;Robin hasn&#39;t dome anything,&quot; another old lady shook her cane as she 
yelled, &quot;you oughta be ashamed of yourselves!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re just doing our jobs,&quot; another agent called, egg yolk dripping off 
his shield arm.

&quot;Yeah, I heard the Nazis were fond of saying that too,&quot; Kat yelled from 
the doorway, &quot;just following orders!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re supposed to be protecting us!&quot; a old man hollered, &quot;Not chasing 
down people just living their lives! Go away, yer not wanted here!&quot;

The lead agent took in his battered people, the angry people and the 
overall situation and made a on the spot decision. &quot;Return to base!&quot; he 
yelled, ducking under a bad tomato, &quot;I repeat, all units return to 
base!&quot;

As they watched the SHIELD agents soar off Rio mused, &quot;You know, I think 
I could get to like this part or town.&quot;

Kat couldn&#39;t hold back her grin, &quot;Me too.&quot;
