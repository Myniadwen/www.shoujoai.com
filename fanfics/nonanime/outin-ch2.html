<h1>Outside In (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/outin-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Doctor Drakken hummed to himself, walking through the halls of his most 
recent lair.  He was quite proud of himself, and the moment he saw 
Shego, he was going to tell her the good news.  Before he realized what 
happened, however, he was slammed against a wall with an arm hard 
against his throat.

&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; Shego snarled, holding a newspaper in front of 
the blue-skinned man.  The headline blared: &quot;Explosion Rocks Middleton!  
Kim Possible Targeted!&quot;

&quot;I was just about to tell you,&quot; Drakken wheezed.  &quot;Last night, I planted 
an explosive device in Kim Possible&#39;s room without her knowing it.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in the hospital!&quot; Shego growled.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;

&quot;You were out last night,&quot; Drakken protested.  &quot;I would have let you 
push the button, but you weren&#39;t here.&quot;  Shego threw the paper aside, 
took a step back, and punched the man in the face.  She did not let him 
fall to the floor, instead keeping hold of his collar and punching him 
repeatedly in the face and torso.  The inept man whimpered piteously 
when Shego&#39;s hand lit with green flames and drew back.

Shego hesitated.  She held her attack, breathing heavily, glaring at 
Drakken.  When her fist began to move, Drakken screamed.  He waited 
rather patiently for death, but dared to open his eyes when death didn&#39;t 
come to him.  Shego&#39;s fist was buried in a smoking hole in the wall 
beside his head, and she was still glaring at him.

&quot;What did I do?&quot; Drakken sniveled.

----------

Kim groaned and pushed herself up to a sitting position.  She rubbed her 
forehead, closing her eyes to block out the brightness of the clean 
white room to remember what had happened.  Flashes of flames and 
shouting came back to her immediately, but it wasn&#39;t what she was 
searching for.  Who was that person in the cap?  She had already seen 
them earlier that day-the same person who had stopped the purse 
snatching by Bueno Nacho.

After a minute or two, she opened her eyes to look around.  She was 
sitting in a hospital bed, and Ron was sitting in a chair next to the 
bed.  He was leaning in the chair, his head lolling back and forth with 
each of his snores.  Rufus lay curled in the young man&#39;s lap, snoring in 
tandem with him.

&quot;Ron?&quot; Kim asked.  Rufus woke at her voice first, climbing up Ron&#39;s 
shirt to casually slap at his face until he awoke.  The blond man was 
groggy, but perked up immediately when he realized that Kim was awake.

&quot;KP!&quot; he said loudly, jovially.  &quot;Oh, God!  It&#39;s so good to see you 
awake!  Everyone was so worried.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve had worse,&quot; Kim murmured, smiling rather wearily.  &quot;Ron, what 
happened?  The person in the hat-are they still here?&quot;  Ron paled, 
shaking his head slowly.

&quot;They&#39;re at the police station,&quot; he said.

&quot;What?&quot; Kim demanded, sitting up straighter.  &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know why,&quot; he answered.  &quot;All I know is that your mom called me 
and said you were here, and when I got here, Jim was just sitting out in 
front of your room.  I asked him what happened and he kept saying that 
there was a monster that attacked you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s impossible!  They saved my life!  If it wasn&#39;t for them, Jim and 
Tim would be dead too!&quot;

&quot;Kim, that&#39;s all that I know-that&#39;s what your brother said.  What are 
you doing?&quot;  Kim threw the blanket off of herself and stood from the 
bed.  Glad that she had not been changed into hospital garb, Kim started 
for the door.  Ron stood from his chair and grabbed Kim&#39;s shoulder.  
&quot;Kim, what are you doing?&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t right,&quot; she replied tersely.  &quot;Whoever they are, they saved 
my life.  I have to know why the police put them in jail.  And I have 
another bad feeling about who started that fire.&quot;  She walked out of the 
door before Ron could say anything else, and he did not choose to 
follow.

----------

&quot;Ah, Miss Possible!  Good to see you weren&#39;t injured last night.&quot;

&quot;I was told that you arrested somebody last night near my house.  I&#39;d 
like to see them.&quot;  The police captain looked confused for a moment, but 
gave the young woman a smile and a nod.

&quot;I don&#39;t see why not,&quot; she said, taking a ring of keys from her belt.  
&quot;Even a monster like this thing can&#39;t get through arm and leg manacles.&quot;  
Kim stared at the other woman questioningly, but the captain didn&#39;t 
elaborate as she led Kim down a hallway.  When they came to a room with 
a solid steel door, the captain stopped, unlocked the door, and flicked 
the light switch next to the door.

&quot;Wake up,&quot; the captain said shortly.  &quot;You have a visitor.&quot;  Kim looked 
towards the slab of metal that constituted a bed in the cell, but there 
was no one lying on it.  However, there was a lump under a rough brown 
blanket in the corner.  Something silver poked out from under the 
blanket slowly until the blanket fell off of the person&#39;s face.  Kim 
would have rushed from the room if she wasn&#39;t so versed in the strange, 
but even her experience couldn&#39;t keep her from letting out a small gasp.

A very tired looking young woman looked up at Kim, and Kim was sure that 
her eyes would have been glowing if the lights weren&#39;t on.  Animalistic 
gold eyes peered over the blanket, and short, crudely cut silver hair 
fell around her face.  Cat-like ears twitched on the top of the woman&#39;s 
head, turning alternately at Kim and the police captain.  She yawned 
widely, obvious fangs glinting in the light as her tongue lolled out 
slightly.  Without saying a word, she closed her eyes and leaned back 
against the wall.

&quot;She hasn&#39;t said a word,&quot; the captain muttered.  &quot;She howled like a wolf 
when the paramedics tried to take you, though.&quot;  Both women noticed 
something silver slither out from under the blanket.  The captain pushed 
Kim behind her and started to draw the handgun from her shoulder 
harness.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Kim said quietly, putting her hand on the officer&#39;s arm.  She 
cautiously took a step around the other woman, walking towards the woman 
in the corner.  Though she wasn&#39;t sure how she knew what it was, Kim 
watched the woman&#39;s silver-furred tail reach out from under the blanket 
and start to draw in the dirt on the floor.

With the captain standing anxiously at the door with her hand on her 
gun, Kim crouched down near the silver-haired woman and watched her 
tail.  It slowly wrote out three crudely crafted letters:  &quot;TAO.&quot;  Kim 
stared at the letters for a time before looking up at the woman.  The 
woman was looking at her over the blanket, her eyes barely open.  Kim 
looked back at the letters again.

&quot;T, A, and O,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;T, A, and O.  Tao.  Tao?&quot;  She looked up 
to the woman.  &quot;Is your name Tao?&quot;  The woman nodded very slightly, 
sweeping the letters away with her tail.  She started to write something 
else, Kim reading off the letters as she went.  &quot;H, U, N, G, R, Y.&quot;  Kim 
smiled soothingly at Tao.  &quot;Are you hungry?&quot;  Tao nodded again.  Kim 
laughed and looked to the police captain.  The woman in uniform sighed, 
shrugged her shoulders, and turned to acquire some food.

&quot;Can you speak at all?&quot; Kim asked.  Tao shook her head.  &quot;Is it because 
of the smoke from last night?&quot;  Tao shook her head again.  &quot;You just 
can&#39;t talk?&quot;  A nod.  Kim smiled with a sigh.  &quot;All right, all right.  
Can you tell me what happened last night?  Why are you here now?&quot;  Tao 
blinked and looked down at her tail, beginning to write.

Helped, she wrote slowly.  Helped you.

&quot;So why are you here now?&quot;

I was scared.

&quot;You got scared?  Oh, the ambulance siren.  What happened?&quot;

I hurt someone.

&quot;You hurt someone?  How?&quot;

I hit them.  I thought they would hurt you.

&quot;Oh.  Why didn&#39;t you write that for the police?&quot;

I didn&#39;t get a chance.

&quot;Did one of the officers hit you with a stun gun?&quot;  Tao nodded.  The 
police captain walked back into the room carrying a tray with a sandwich 
and a cup of water on it.  She handed it to Kim, who in turn held it out 
to Tao.  The silver-haired woman ate the sandwich slowly, deliberately.  
Kim turned to look at the police captain.

&quot;She said that she hit somebody last night,&quot; she explained.  &quot;Can you 
tell me what happened?&quot;  The woman sighed heavily, staring at Tao.

&quot;When I first arrived with my partner, the paramedics and the 
firefighters hadn&#39;t gotten there yet,&quot; she said.  &quot;Your mother and 
father, Kim, had just gotten out of the fire.  We were waiting for you 
to come out with your brothers when a window on the second floor blew 
out.  We thought it was just from the heat, but then she landed right in 
the middle of us.  She was carrying your brothers-one in each arm-and 
you on her back.

&quot;Your mother took your brothers, and one of them woke up enough to stand 
on his own.  I was about to take you, but then the paramedics and the 
firefighters arrived.  One of the paramedics tried to take you, but she 
hit him.  Clawed three gashes in his faces and dislocated his jaw.  My 
partner reacted by jamming a tazer in her neck.  And here we are now.&quot;

&quot;Tao was scared,&quot; Kim said in turn.  &quot;She thought that something was 
going to hurt me-she was trying to protect me.&quot;

&quot;Why would she do that?&quot; the captain asked.  &quot;She doesn&#39;t even know 
you.&quot;  Kim looked at Tao, who was now sipping at the water.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she answered.  &quot;But I don&#39;t think she really meant to 
hurt anyone.&quot;  The captain looked thoughtful for a moment.

&quot;Animal instinct,&quot; she murmured.  When Kim looked at her in question, 
she continued.  &quot;Look at her.  She&#39;s more animal than human.  There must 
be something about you that made her protect you.&quot;  Kim said nothing in 
response to this.  She instead watched Tao silently.  The silver-haired 
woman seemed more alert, her ears turning towards the door behind the 
captain and Kim.

&quot;Tao, do you have any family?&quot; Kim asked.  &quot;A last name?&quot;  Tao nodded, 
looking at her tail.  Kim followed her gaze and stared for many minutes 
at the name that Tao wrote down.  The captain noticed Kim&#39;s stupor and 
dared to ask.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked.  &quot;What does &#39;Psymon&#39; mean?&quot;  Kim shook 
herself slightly, still staring at the name.

&quot;Psymon,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;I&#39;ve heard of the name Psymon.  There were old 
articles about a biogenetic scientist named Ion Psymon-she&#39;s a genius.  
But the last article about her was something I found in a library 
newsreel from twenty years ago.  She had been working with a military 
scientist named Sean Green, and she just dropped off the face of the 
earth.  How can you be her...daughter?&quot;  Tao made no move to reply with 
her tail, instead drawing the appendage back under the blanket.  Kim 
turned to the captain, sighing confusedly.

&quot;I think it would be a good idea to release her into your custody,&quot; the 
older woman said.  &quot;If she&#39;s as tame as you say she is, then you should 
be able to make her go home.&quot;  Kim frowned, her humanitarian mind 
angered by the captain&#39;s words.

&quot;You&#39;re making her sound like a vicious animal,&quot; she whispered.

&quot;She is a vicious animal,&quot; the captain replied in a harsh, loud tone.  
She shoved two keys into Kim&#39;s hand before turning and walking out of 
the room.  Kim watched her leave, stunned at the words.  She turned to 
Tao, but the young woman showed nothing on her face.

&quot;Come on, give me your hands,&quot; Kim said gently.  &quot;You&#39;ll have to show me 
where your mother lives so I can tell the police you didn&#39;t run away.&quot;  
Tao took the second key once Kim had unlocked the manacles around her 
wrists and unlocked the leg-manacles herself.  She stood up and brushed 
the dirt from her brown pants and green shirt.  Her tail wrapped around 
her waist, hidden under the long green shirt.  Rather self-consciously, 
she reached up and touched her cat-like ears.

&quot;You can&#39;t hide them?&quot; Kim asked.  Tao shook her head, but walked to the 
door anyway.  As they walked through the hall, the overnight 
inmates-drunkards, brawlers, and burglars-stared at Tao.

&quot;Freak!&quot;  A metal cup filled with water flew from a cell and hit Tao in 
the back of the head.  She paused for only a moment, but kept walking.  
When she stepped into the main lobby, everything went completely silent.  
The officers froze the moment they saw her.  The uncomfortable silence 
might have escalated into a more violent version of what had just 
happened in the cell block, had the doors to the station not been broken 
forcibly down.

&quot;Get the hell in there!&quot;  A beaten, bruised, and bloody Doctor Drakken 
was thrown headlong into the front desk, followed quickly by a raging 
Shego.  She curled one fist, green flames bursting into view.  Drakken 
whimpered, scooting uselessly into the desk to try and avoid Shego&#39;s 
growing wrath.

&quot;Shego, stop!&quot; Kim shouted.  Shego froze, turning to look at Kim.  Her 
breath was ragged with her dissipating rage, and the flames around her 
hand hadn&#39;t faded.  She turned, taking a step towards Kim, the disbelief 
before joy evident on her face.  The police, however, did not know that 
Shego felt joy seeing Kim was all right.

&quot;Freeze!&quot; sixteen voices cried in unison.  Handguns were drawn all 
around the room, sights set on Shego.  The moment was too far-gone.  The 
police saw that Shego had beaten Drakken, and that she was staring at 
Kim Possible with disbelief on her face.  Everything clicked in their 
minds, for what they knew.  Kim looked at the officers, wishing to 
scream for them to stop, to hold their fire.  However, she knew that by 
the time she took a breath, Shego would have quite a few rounds in her 
chest.

Kim felt something brush by her side, turning to look at Tao.  The woman 
was gone, and a thud made her stop her glance less than halfway.  She 
turned back only in time to see Shego vanish suddenly.  The police 
looked around confusedly, wondering where Tao and Shego had gone.  The 
captain took charge first.

&quot;Outside, now!&quot; she shouted.  The officers rushed out the door, guns up 
and searching for a target.  Kim followed, standing just outside the 
door as the officers charged down the few stairs and out onto the 
sidewalk.  Tao dropped down noiselessly in front of Kim and grabbed her, 
easily pulling the other woman onto her back.  Too stunned for words, 
Kim wrapped her arms around Tao&#39;s neck and held tightly as the 
silver-haired woman sprang up and somehow latched onto the wall with 
just her bare hands and feet.

She jumped up over the edge of the building, landing next to an out of 
breath and rather stunned Shego.  When she jerked her thumb over her 
shoulder, Kim breathlessly translated for her.

&quot;Grab hold of me,&quot; she gasped.  Shego shook her head, too astounded by 
the events to comprehend.  Tao grabbed her and, just as easily as Kim, 
pulled the woman onto Kim&#39;s back.  She put her hands to the ground and 
started to run on all fours, leaping from rooftop to rooftop with 
unbelievable ease and speed.  For the first time in her life, and only 
because of her flame and smoke-weakened state, Kim passed out from the 
chaotic action around her.
