<h1>Kitty and Illyana: A Tale of Magik! (part 19 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/talemagik-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>The sitting room where they went to make their plans was comfortable, 
beautiful paintings hung up on the walls. Various chairs and a couch 
were occupied by Kitty and Illyanna together while Rachel and the 
Phoenix sat in their own chairs. A tea set and cups were set up, snacks 
helpfully provided by the kitchen ghost.

&quot;No,&quot; Illyanna just shook her head firmly in response to the question, 
her long blonde hair flowing around her. She took a drink of her tea, 
the T-shirt and jeans she wore comfortable.

Rachel looked surprised as the young redhead asked, &quot;You can&#39;t use the 
stepping disks to get us to England?&quot;

&#39;Rachel even dresses like us now,&#39; Kitty silently noted the similar 
clothes that they all wore, &#39;or maybe that&#39;s something she picked up 
from our future selves?&#39; Aloud the brown haired girl said, &quot;The longer 
the range to teleport the greater chance there is that we might 
time-slip or miss our target, it&#39;s a problem with the stepping disks 
themselves.&quot;

&quot;Good explanation,&quot; Illyanna complimented her.

&quot;Coo,&quot; Lockheed the dragon murmured to himself contentedly, munching on 
cookies.

Phoenix reached out, gently scratching the animal with a contented 
smile. &quot;I&#39;d offer to transport you,&quot; she said, the fiery replica of Jean 
Gray looking mildly apologetic about it, &quot;but I think it would be best 
to keep a low profile.&quot;

&quot;With a unknown enemy that makes sense,&quot; Kitty nodded.

&quot;So how do we get there?&quot; Rachel asked.

&quot;There&#39;s always more conventional methods of transportation,&quot; Illyanna 
offered, &quot;we could always just take a plane.&quot;

&quot;Or....&quot; Kitty trailed off thoughtfully.

&quot;Whenever you do that it always makes me nervous,&quot; Illyanna commented. 
She smiled slightly, &quot;You had an idea?&quot;

&quot;And is it hazardous to our health?&quot; Rachel asked with a sigh. She had 
been the lab-rat recently for one of Kitty&#39;s magical experiments and she 
was sure her eyebrows were still a bit burnt. Admittedly she had 
volunteered, but still....

Kitty gave her a wounded look, &quot;I didn&#39;t know that the Phoenix residue 
on you would react with the chaos invocation....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure Kitty knows what she&#39;s doing,&quot; Phoenix said before giving 
Kitty a dangerous glance and asking, &quot;right?&quot;

Kitty didn&#39;t go pale but she certainly looked a bit nervous as she 
swiftly reassured them, &quot;It&#39;s perfectly harmless.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s the plan?&quot; Illyanna asked.

Kitty looked thoughtful, &quot;First I need to test it, care to help me?&quot;
&quot;Of course,&quot; Illyanna stood, offering Kitty her hand.

The two got up from the couch, Rachel and Phoenix trailing along behind 
them as they walked down the hall over to the workroom. Kitty pulled two 
basins from a shelf and set them down on the table, each several feet 
apart.

&quot;Could someone get me some water?&quot; Kitty asked.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Rachel quickly left and soon returned to the room carrying a 
full bucket, the water sloshing around inside.

&quot;I almost expected you to use magic,&quot; Phoenix noted, watching all the 
goings on curiously.

Rachel spoke up before Kitty and Illyanna could, giving the Phoenix a 
slight smile. &quot;Using magic takes energy,&quot; she explained, &quot;derived 
directly from us. If there&#39;s a normal way to do something it&#39;s better to 
use it rather than burn energy on magic.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Kitty nodded.

Illyanna walked over to where Kitty stood, dropping her voice to a 
whisper. &quot;Do you think we should try to contact Dr. Strange?&quot; she asked.

Kitty watched Rachel carefully filing the basins as she softly answered, 
&quot;I tried earlier but I couldn&#39;t get through. I don&#39;t know exactly why, 
though.&quot;

&quot;Ominous,&quot; Illyanna quipped.

&quot;Or it could be he and Clea were busy,&quot; Kitty flashed a grin.

&quot;So what now?&quot; Rachel asked, the basins filled to the edge as Kitty had 
instructed.

&quot;I&#39;m curious too,&quot; Illyanna admitted as they walked over to the work 
table where the other two women were waiting.

&quot;We all know about sympathetic magic,&quot; Kitty said in a lecturing tone as 
she rolled up her sleeves, &quot;when a object is used to represent all other 
things of that same type?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; the Phoenix nodded seriously.

&quot;This experiment uses that principle,&quot; Kitty said, holding her hands 
over each bowl and chanting softly, threads of magical energy dancing 
over them. She finished up, light flickering as she closed her hands as 
she said, &quot;Who wants to stick their arm into a basin?&quot;

Illyanna stepped up and held a hand just over the surface of the still 
water. She puffed out a breath, &quot;Let&#39;s see what happens.&quot;

With that Illyanna smoothly thrust her hand in one of the basins and 
blinked in shock as her arm then popped up from the other one, still 
perfectly dry. The blonde beauty wiggled her fingers experimentally as 
the others looked on in disbelief.

Rachel looked at the strangely disembodied hand then shook her head, 
&quot;That&#39;s impressive, I have to admit.&quot; She looked a bit nervous, &quot;But how 
do we use this to get to England?&quot;

&quot;Using this spell we can step into a pool of water here,&quot; Kitty 
explained as Illyanna pulled her hand out of the water, &quot;and emerge from 
any other one around the world.&quot;

&quot;Skuld!&quot; Illyanna exclaimed, surprising the others. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she 
apologized before turning to Kitty, &quot;You figured out how that goddess 
transported herself through water!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure if this is the exact method she uses,&quot; Kitty cautioned, 
&quot;but once I found out it could be done I wanted to puzzle it out.&quot; She 
paused, taking a look at Phoenix as she said, &quot;There might still be one 
problem.&quot;

Phoenix looked confused then gazed down at her fiery body sheepishly. 
&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; she murmured, &quot;would it help if I took on a human form?&quot;

Illyanna smiled wryly, &quot;As long as it&#39;s not a problem.&quot;

Phoenix stood there, her fiery edged body glowing with energy as she 
flared brightly. The wings of flame danced around her, power building up 
incredibly yet tightly contained. There was a soft bamf of air, smoke 
swirling as a woman was revealed.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Rachel managed.

They looked almost like twin sisters, this redheaded young woman 
standing there in the circle of burnt floor. Her long red hair was 
streaked with gold as it flowed over her shoulders, her green eyes 
glowing with gentle amusement. Her body was clearly healthy, too, as 
could be easily seen because she wasn&#39;t wearing any clothes.

Kitty chanted something softly, materializing a blanket which she put 
over Phoenix&#39;s shoulders. &quot;You couldn&#39;t have created clothes?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;Not that we minded the free show,&quot; Illyanna murmured under her breath.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Phoenix smiled, pulling the robe around her. She looked over at 
Rachel, &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind that I used you as a template?&quot;

Rachel&#39;s cheeks were faintly red as she answered, &quot;No, not at all.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s get you dressed,&quot; Kitty said, &quot;then we&#39;ll get ready to go.&quot; She 
looked around, &quot;Now where is Lockheed?&quot;

Back in the sitting room the dragon lay on the table that had held all 
the snacks. The plates of food were all empty, only crumbs left and the 
teacups dry. The dragon&#39;s belly bulged, he had eaten so much, and he had 
a very self satisfied look on his face.

&quot;Urp,&quot; Lockheed burped.</pre>
