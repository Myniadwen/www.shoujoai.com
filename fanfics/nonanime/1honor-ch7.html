<a href="../nonanime/1honor-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Honor,&quot; Ryouko looked up with a grin as she said
dramatically, &quot;help save me from this!&quot;

The blue haired Empress of Manticore waved toward the
thick piles of papers that cluttered the desk in her
office aboard the Washu&#39;s Revenge even as Honor walked
into the room. Nimitz eagerly leapt down from Honor&#39;s
shoulder to join Ryo-Ohki, the two exchanging
conversation made up entirely of &#39;Bleeks&#39; and &#39;Myahs.&#39;

&quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am,&quot; Honor Harrington said, the slim brown
haired woman fighting back a little smile, &quot;I think
you&#39;re stuck with doing at least some of it.&quot; In the
many months that had passed since the peaceful merger
of Manticore and Basilisk Honor had gotten more used
to her leader&#39;s casual style, but it still felt... a
bit odd.

&quot;Maybe I can foist some of this on Minagi,&quot; Ryouko
shook her head. She brightened slightly as she
drawled, &quot;So how&#39;s Michelle?&quot;

Honor felt her cheeks reddening slightly under her
amused gaze, it was quite obvious that Ryouko had
heard about the scene the two of them had made down at
the boarding docks. Michelle had just gotten back from
a long patrol assignment and she had gotten a wee bit
carried away in her greeting Honor. Not that Honor had
been too restrained, either.

&quot;She&#39;s still asleep,&quot; Honor murmured, thinking of
everything they had done last night, not to mention
this morning.

&quot;Ah honeymooning,&quot; Ryouko chuckled. A bit more
seriously she said, &quot;I asked you to come here for a
reason, Honor.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s time to move against Kagato,&quot; Honor didn&#39;t even
make it a question.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Ryouko nodded. She rubbed at her eyes
tiredly and Honor realized that she probably hadn&#39;t
slept. &quot;How have the fleet exercises been going?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;Very well,&quot; Honor answered, &quot;we&#39;re pulling together
nicely. Overall ship efficiency is in the ninety
percentile range with a few vessels nearing one
hundred.&quot;

&quot;Like the Nike,&quot; Ryouko named Honor&#39;s ship with a
grin. Her smile disappeared as she continued, &quot;But we
both know how powerful Kagato is.&quot;

&quot;I heard about the Galaxy Police&#39;s attempt to bring
him in,&quot; Honor agreed.

Only a few weeks ago a powerful fleet of GP cruisers
had attempted to engage Kagato&#39;s ship the Soja in
battle and it had been a complete disaster. The
cruisers had been far too overconfident in their Jurai
provided technology, waltzing in to try to hammer at
the Soja, but the massive ship&#39;s shields easily held
them all off. The powerful weapons array of the Soja
wiped out the ships with ridiculous ease, the remnants
swept aside like so much garbage.

Ryouko made a face at the mention of the GP but she
nodded slightly. &quot;The GP aren&#39;t pushovers,&quot; she said,
&quot;anyone who can defeat them so easily isn&#39;t to be
taken lightly.&quot;

&#39;Guess the GP still has a price on Ryouko&#39;s head,&#39;
Honor noted silently. &quot;But we&#39;re much better
equipped,&quot; Honor answered her aloud, &quot;thanks to
Washu&#39;s designs and our two homeworlds&#39; ship-building
capabilities.&quot;

Ryouko shook her head, her eyes narrowing slightly.
&quot;Sorry for fretting,&quot; she said, &quot;we&#39;ve been working
towards this for so long that it&#39;s a bit strange,
finally being ready to go.&quot; Ryouko made a face, &quot;Not
to mention mother&#39;s latest innovation.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Honor prompted.

&quot;A powerful new ship design,&quot; Ryouko said, &quot;with both
improved shielding and weapons capabilities that she
calls Swordbreaker. The problem is that bringing it
into production will take us several months, at
least.&quot;

There was a soft tapping from the doorway and Minagi
sauntered inside, her sleek black bodysuit hugging her
form. She looked almost the same as Ryouko did, only
the two bold scars on her cheeks making her different.
&quot;Yo,&quot; she casually waved as she flopped down on a
chair, &quot;did you tell Honor about the fighters?&quot;

&quot;Just about to,&quot; Ryouko said, clearly cross about
Minagi spilling the beans.

&quot;The light armored combat units?&quot; Honor sat up in
surprise as she asked, &quot;You were able to make the
design work?&quot;

&quot;Actually Basilisk&#39;s tech boys were pretty close to a
breakthrough,&quot; Ryouko pointed out, &quot;we just took their
work and built on it.&quot;

&quot;Washu&#39;s got the prototypes ready to test,&quot; Minagi
said, &quot;but it&#39;ll be a month before we&#39;re ready to go
to full production.&quot;

The Light Armored Combat unit or LAC was something
Basilisk had been trying to develop, but the technical
difficulties had stopped them. They couldn&#39;t come up
with weapons systems or drives that would be powerful
enough to make the small craft effective in battle.
Obviously, Washu had been able to solve those
problems.

&quot;We&#39;ll need to recruit pilots, too,&quot; Honor murmured, a
slight frown on her face. The pilots of the fighters
would be facing grave risks, she knew, and the
casualties would probably be high.

&quot;I&#39;m already looking into volunteers,&quot; Minagi said
seriously. She leaned forward slightly, &quot;Have you
decided what we&#39;re going to do about Kagato?&quot;

Ryouko got up from her desk, walking over to the
viewport to gaze out at the stars. &quot;As much as I&#39;d
like to take more time to ready our fleet,&quot; she said
seriously, &quot;I think it&#39;s time.&quot; She turned back to
look at the others, &quot;Contact Washu and the fleet
commanders, we need to prepare our tactical options.
It&#39;s time to deal with Kagato.&quot;

&quot;Damn it!&quot; Nagi loudly cursed. The floor of the bridge
seemed to heave up beneath them, the Nike rocking with
the force of the blow but the cruiser recovered
quickly. Around the bridge the crew worked
efficiently, handling emergency alerts and maintaining
ship&#39;s systems.

Honor nearly chided Nagi for her language but
restrained herself. The light blue hair framed the
other woman&#39;s face, the former bounty hunter rather
uncomfortably wearing the fleet&#39;s uniform. Honor&#39;s
regular second in command was in sickbay, badly
injured in the initial assault, so Nagi had stepped up
to do the job.

&quot;Fleet status?&quot; Honor barked.

&quot;We&#39;ve lost a quarter of our ships,&quot; Hudson reported,
sounding much more confident than when Honor had first
commanded him months ago, &quot;and the Soja&#39;s shields are
holding fast.&quot;

&quot;And Michelle Henke&#39;s Dauntless?&quot; Honor asked, keeping
her voice even. She had seen the explosion a few
moments ago, and prayed that....

&quot;No answer to our hails,&quot; Yuri said from
communications, the black haired woman looking over at
Honor in sympathy.

Honor closed her eyes a moment, feeling as if she
wanted to die, then she banished all emotion to focus
on the task at hand. &quot;We keep going,&quot; Honor said
firmly.

On the viewscreen the Washu&#39;s Revenge and the Soja
floated in space a ridiculously short distance apart,
the two massive vessels exchanging weapons fire at
point blank range. The Soja loomed even over the
Revenge but the smaller ship survived all it could
dish out even as Washu&#39;s unique weapons designs beat
it back. All around them the Manticore fleet floated
in a spherical formation, throwing firepower down
continuously against the Soja.

&quot;I almost wish that GP ship would finally do
something,&quot; Nagi murmured from where she stood by
Honor&#39;s side. The Galaxy Patrol vessel hung back out
of range, obviously using it&#39;s sensor systems to
record the battle for any useful data.

&quot;Later,&quot; was Honor&#39;s reply. She studied the tactical
display a moment, &quot;We&#39;ve got to move in closer,&quot; she
said grimly, &quot;increase the intensity and cohesion of
our attacks. We might break through, or at least
distract the Soja enough for the Revenge to break
through.&quot;

Nagi nodded bleakly as she said so softly that only
Honor would hear, &quot;We&#39;ll be under greater fire but I
think it&#39;s a good call.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Honor smiled just slightly. She raised her
voice, &quot;Yuri, get me the flagship, we need to let
Ryouko know what we plan....&quot;

A squeal of feedback ripped across the bridge and Yuri
swiftly bent over her controls. &quot;A Fleet wide
communication,&quot; she reported, &quot;coming from the GP
cruiser.&quot;

Honor and Nagi exchanged a surprised look. &quot;Put it
on,&quot; Nagi ordered.

Two women appeared on the screen, the cockpit of the
GP cruiser with a black haired young woman and a quite
clearly annoyed looking redhead sitting beside her in
the co-pilot seat. &quot;This is Galaxy Police officer
Kiyone,&quot; the black haired woman said.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re doing this,&quot; the redhead
scowled.

&quot;Save it, Mitsuki,&quot; Kiyone answered crisply. She
turned back to say, &quot;There appears to be a momentary
weakness in the Soja&#39;s shields when he launches an
attack.&quot;

&quot;Confirm that,&quot; Honor barked to her tactical officer
as the GP cruiser moved in to take up a place in their
line of battle.

&quot;Now that she&#39;s brought it to our attention,&quot; Hudson
shook his head ruefully, &quot;I can see it.&quot;

The next time Soja launched an attack the Washu&#146;s
revenge and the cruiser fired almost as one, rupturing
the massive ship&#146;s hull. The enemy&#146;s weapons were
quickly disabled as the ships moved in, Honor helping
direct the mopping up.

As Honor worked she watched the communication feed as
Ryouko hailed the GP cruiser. &#147;Thank you for your
help,&#148; Ryouko smiled. More seriously she said, &#147;I and
my sister Minagi are going in after Kagato.&#148;

&#147;I wish I could go along,&#148; Kiyone said as she saw
Mitsuki glaring at her, &#147;and I wish you good hunting.
That bastard&#146;s killed more than a few GP officers over
the years.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ll get him,&#148; Ryouko smiled, and the transmission
cut off.

Nagi shook her head, her expression grim. &quot;I hope the
Marshal of the GP is in a good mood,&quot; she said, &quot;or
that officer is in big trouble.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve got our own problems,&quot; Honor answered.

It took a few hours before they found out the results
of the battle, Ryouko and Minagi slaying Kagato on the
bridge of the Soja. Honor didn&#39;t care much about that,
instead her efforts were focused on the recovery of
the lifepods. The medical bay was busy as they were
cracked open, injured men and women pulled out one at
a time.

The clear gel the pods used to protect their contents
glistened as the woman struggled to get out and Honor
felt a moment of purest relief. &quot;Michelle,&quot; she
breathed, rushing to her lover&#39;s side.

Michelle smiled weakly, the dusky skinned officer
leaning against Honor&#39;s easy strength. &quot;The
Dauntless?&quot; she asked weakly.

&quot;Gone,&quot; Honor answered, &quot;but we&#39;ve recovered most of
your crew.&quot;

&quot;Thank god,&quot; Michelle slumped, exhausted.
