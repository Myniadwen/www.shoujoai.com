<a href="../nonanime/wreckage-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>The Enchantress leaned forward, her simple gown revealing a sexy bit
of cleavage as the blonde studied the image in her scrying pool.
Amora winced as Thunderstrike hammered a Raider from the air with
her mace, &quot;That&#39;s got to hurt.&quot;

Her Raiders were armored criminals, wearing red, blue and silver
designed knock offs of Iron Man tech. They could fly, were fairly
durable and the blasters mounted on each arm easily out-gunned the
police, however they weren&#39;t doing so well against these three.
Individually the suits didn&#39;t come close to the power of any one of
the three heroines, and they weren&#39;t coordinating well as a group.

&quot;They&#39;re going down,&quot; Morgan Stark said, the somewhat rumpled
looking business man standing nearby on the sound stage that Amora
liked using as a headquarters. He looked at Amora, &quot;Do you think you
should pull them out?&quot;

Several of the Raiders attempted to dogpile on War Machine, but were
easily shrugged off as the suits shoulder cannon began to target
their vulnerable joints. In moments she disabled several as the wild
melee continued.

&quot;No,&quot; Amora shook her head, &quot;if they can&#39;t deal with this, they&#39;re
of no use to me.&quot; With a wave of her hand she banished the view of
the battle, &quot;We&#39;ll need to do some recruiting.&quot;

From a inside pocket of his suit Morgan removed a personal
organizer. &quot;Any preferences?&quot; he asked as he scrolled through his
files.

&quot;Power and flexibility,&quot; Amora mused, &quot;who we bring in will need to
be able to face off against any one of the three heroes.&quot;

&quot;Major names?&quot; Morgan mused.

&quot;They usually have pride issues,&quot; Amora noted, &quot;I don&#39;t want rivals,
just minions.&quot;

&quot;Carolyn Trainer, the Lady Octopus is currently in jail,&quot; Morgan
mused, &quot;but she&#39;s a follower and a potential asset. We could spring
her fairly easily.&quot;

Amora looked at the picture he called up dubiously, &quot;I don&#39;t like
technology, still... make the arrangements.&quot;

&quot;Three agents?&quot; Morgan continued his search.

&quot;Five, I would think, all formidable fighters,&quot; Amora mused, &quot;we
need to be sure.&quot;

&quot;How about the assassins Feral and Sakura?&quot; Morgan asked as he
remembered she had allowed them into the city.

&quot;No, not yet,&quot; Amora shook her head, &quot;we may need to capture them,
not kill.&quot;

After a period of work they found their five candidates, then Morgan
left with a respectful bow. &quot;I&#39;ll have a report on their
availability tomorrow,&quot; he said, &quot;they should begin to arrive in a
few days.&quot;

&quot;Do that,&quot; Amora casually waved him away.

Sitting back on her throne Amora reactivated the crying pool, gazing
at the three adventurers before focusing her gaze on Thunderstrike.
The armored woman moved with grace and power, dealing out punishing
blows with her fists and mace. She looked stunning in the sunlight,
glittering like a star amid the common streets of Los Angeles.

Amora felt her pulse race a bit as she studied Thunderstrike, this
mortal who used a piece of Asgardian power. &quot;Yes,&quot; she murmured as
Thunderstrike felled another foe, &quot;you may very well be worthy of
me.&quot;

Meanwhile, on that street Warbird casually tore the power back off
the back of one of the last raider suits, carrying the stunned pilot
to the ground. All around them a busy commercial street was in
ruins, store windows busted, fire hydrants spewing water and several
cars burning away cheerfully.

&quot;Is everyone all right?&quot; Warbird asked, the blonde haired woman&#39;s
black bathing suit like costume clinging to every curve.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; War Machine reassured her, the metallic grey armored
figure casually tossing a fallen raider onto a stack of unconscious
foes.

Thunderstrike&#39;s long black hair flowed around her head as she smiled
wryly, &quot;I&#39;m a bit tired, but good.&quot;

`Nice to see that she has some physical limits,&#39; Carol reflected as
Warbird landed. They had spent nearly half a hour fighting these
fools as well as chasing them down, none of which had been terribly
easy. &quot;All right,&quot; Warbird shook her slightly dazed captive
awake, &quot;who sent you? Who&#39;s giving the orders around here?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t...&quot; the young man&#39;s helm partially obscured his face, but
his confusion was obvious as he stammered, &quot;I don&#39;t know. Who am I?
Where are we?&quot;

&quot;You have got to be kidding me,&quot; War Machine muttered, making a
imposing figure as the masculine looking armor loomed nearby.

&quot;What?&quot; Thunderstrike asked, looking at the two of them warily.

&quot;Amnesia is a common malady with super crooks in this town,&quot; War
Machine sounded disgusted, &quot;it&#39;s like something makes career crooks
forget anything useful once they&#39;re caught.&quot;

&quot;And it&#39;s not an act?&quot; Warbird asked as she put the armored crook
down on the ground with his fallen band of cohorts.

&quot;Medical examinations and psyche profiles all hold up,&quot; War Machine
confirmed.

&quot;Well that&#39;s annoying,&quot; Thunderstrike frowned as the first police
sirens began to wail. She looked at the other two heroines, &quot;Should
we stick around?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I assume we want to play nice with the police for Olivia&#39;s
sake,&quot; Warbird said, a bit of annoyance in her voice.

The arrival of the police soon lead to much heated discussion on
their activities and the property damage, though the responding
officers were more than grudgingly grateful for the defeat of the
Raiders group. In the end several paddy wagons picked up the crooks
and carted them off, and the three heroes took off together.

&quot;I need to take off a while,&quot; Warbird informed them, peeling off
from the flight to Stane&#39;s headquarters, &quot;I&#39;ll check in again later.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; War Machine agreed, &quot;I can report to Olivia on my own
if we need to.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d better take off too,&quot; Thunderstrike admitted, &quot;I need to go
apartment hunting.&quot;

Warbird smiled as she soared across the city, mentally composing the
story she&#39;d write as Carol Danvers, crime reporter. Landing nearby
she reverted to her civilian identity and rushed inside, hurrying to
her desk and typing away on the older computer furiously.

&quot;Danvers!&quot; her boss Ron roared, &quot;Where&#39;s the story on...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m putting the last touches on a story on the Raider;&#39;s capture,&quot;
Carol shouted back, not even pausing in her typing.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Ron smiled slightly, heading back into his office.

&quot;You know, he&#39;d normally rip someone&#39;s head off for a response like
that,&quot; a amused female voice noted, &quot;I think he likes you.&quot;

Carol didn&#39;t even look up from the screen as she said
wryly, &quot;Monica, that is a vaguely scary thought.&quot;

Monica Stewart chuckled softly, the older redhead shaking her head
slightly. &quot;Well, that and you&#39;re our most productive reporter. Two
stories a day, and fillers too? He loves you,&quot; she laughed softly.

&quot;Eww,&quot; Carol shuddered as she finished and zapped the story to
editorial to review.

In actuality, this job had ended up about as easy as any other she
had. She had gotten pretty good at hammering out paperwork during
her days with the CIA and later with homeland security, and writing
articles wasn&#39;t all that different. Of course, shedding the dry
governmental style had taken some effort, but she was managing.

&quot;Heather&#39;s been asking around about you,&quot; Monica said as she sat
down, &quot;I think she&#39;s got a crush on you.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Carol blinked.

&quot;Damn you can be innocent some times,&quot; Monica chuckles. &quot;Wanna talk
it over with some dinner?&quot;

&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Carol sighed as her stomach growled loudly.</pre>
