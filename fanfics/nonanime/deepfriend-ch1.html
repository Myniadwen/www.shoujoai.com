<pre>I glanced at Courtney during lunch.  She was sitting with Miranda on 
the grass underneath a tree, her back turned to me. I noticed Miranda 
was giving me odd looks.  Not her usual cold ones, just.........odd, 
and I knew the reason why. It was a beautiful sunny afternoon, with a 
light breeze. I was alone, waiting for Dodie, Macie and Darren as 
usual. Today was the day both Courtney and I were going to tell 
everyone the truth about our true relationship. Lying on my back, my 
arms behind my head, I looked up at the blue sky, totally oblivious to 
the constant chatter of the other students, thinking about the weekend 
before, where I stayed over at Courtney&#39;s, when she made her 
confession, and what we did after that........

It has been a few months since we started our sophomore year at Lucky 
Junior High.  Life was normal, until I noticed a sudden change in 
Courtney&#39;s personality.  This has been going on since the year before.  
She was no longer her normal, bubbly and cheery self.  I noticed she 
was often alone.  I recently heard that she and Miranda were no longer 
best friends.  I thought it was a rumor, because I had trouble taking 
it in.  I was right.  They still hung out, but they were a lot more 
distant.  

Courtney was even more popular than ever before, and I could not help 
but notice that I was somewhat more attracted to her.  I pushed away 
the thought, scolding myself for having such thoughts about another 
girl.  Still, this was Courtney, the girl who invited me to all of her 
parties, who tried to make me one of the populars, who was my friend 
since junior high, who realized who her true friends were, despite the 
objections of Miranda, she never once did anything bad to me.  I 
wonder how she thought about me.  We were getting much more closer.  I 
began to wonder if she was going to come to me.  I kept hearing how I 
was like the next &quot;candidate&quot; to be her best friend.  I didn&#39;t want 
that, as I never wanted to take Miranda&#39;s place.  No matter how many 
countless times she tried to push me away from Courtney, I was never 
the kind of person to hold a personal grudge.  

But every time I greeted Courtney, she would simply answer back and 
walk away.  She no longer seemed to care about her popularity anymore.  
The other popular girls, who were more friendly to me, said that she 
would not even speak to them.  Now that was awfully weird of her.  Day 
after day, I started to get the feeling she was looking at me in 
strange ways, and it was starting to freak me out.  I decided to plan 
a day when I would confront her and ask what her problem was.

Then it happened.  Her mother had to rush out of town for the weekend, 
taking Blake with her.  She even gave all of their servants that 
entire time off.  But Courtney wanted to stay behind, saying she had a 
big project to work on, so Mrs. Gripling gave her permission to invite 
a friend over so that she would not be lonely.  I was surprised when 
the first person she asked was me.  I thought this is a bit strange of 
her, but I decided to go along with it.  So that Friday afternoon I 
sat with Courtney during the limo ride to the mansion.  I only had to 
bring my pajamas, since she had all I would need.  She used to be so 
reluctant in sharing her things, but now she has grown to be even more 
mature and responsible........As I looked out the window, enjoying the 
wonderful scenery, I had a strange feeling that I was being watched.  
I turned around, just in time to see Courtney whirl her head.  It was 
silent during the ride.  Winston tried to make conversation, but it 
did not work so well.  We said good-bye and wished him a happy trip as 
we entered the mansion.  It felt weird that we were the only two 
people, but I convinced myself that there was nothing to fear.  

I felt like asking her why she did not invite Miranda or anyone else, 
but it would probably hurt her.  We managed to talk a bit about school 
and homework as we ate dinner.  Sometimes we would talk about the 
topics she liked, like fashion and what she did during her trip to 
Paris last summer.  We did our homework in her room.  As I watched her 
TV as she did hers.  Later, as I took a shower in her bathroom, I 
thought about the way she acted towards me in the limo, and no matter 
how I thought about it, it always came back the one conclusion: &lt;She 
must be attracted to me.  But why?  Why me?  How can she think like 
that?  We&#39;re both girls!  And doesn&#39;t she still have a crush on Will?  
Come to think of it, she never talks about him anymore.  Oh God, does 
that mean.....the reason she invited me over.....&gt;  I shook my head, 
pushing the thoughts away.  

I got out, only to see Courtney already inside, half-naked.  I stared 
at her body.  &quot;Uhhhh.......I&#39;m finished.&quot;  I rushed out, grabbing a 
towel along the way before anything else happened.  I dried my hair, 
trying to shake away the feelings I had.  I could not believe what I 
had felt after seeing her like that.  I had not felt this way since I 
met Ian and Sasha.  I had seen her naked before, when we dressed up in 
PE, but never that close.  I hope she did not see me blushing 
furiously.  &lt;What&#39;s wrong with me?  I can&#39;t think of her that way.  
She&#39;s my friend, so why am I attracted to her like that?  So she has a 
good figure and she&#39;s gotten a lot prettier, I ought to be admiring 
her beauty, so why do I feel like I&#39;m on fire?&gt;  I suddenly remembered 
the way she looked at me when I got out of the shower.  Like she was 
checking me out.  &lt;No way, does she actually like me like that?  Do I 
like her in the same way?  I had never been interested in girls 
before.  I liked Ian......no, he&#39;s too busy on the football team to 
ever have a girlfriend.  I really do like Courtney.  We had been 
through so much together.  If she wanted a girlfriend I thought she 
would go after Miranda.  So why me?&gt;  I had never imagined I would be 
the center of someone&#39;s attention, especially someone like Courtney.  

Confused, I sat at the edge of the bed, in my pajamas, waiting for 
her.  When she entered, I looked at her pajamas.  &lt;Gorgeous!&gt;  I was 
staring into space when I noticed Courtney was only a few inches from 
my face.  I snapped out of it and looked into her eyes.  &quot;Ginger, 
thank you for staying over,&quot; she spoke softly.  I could feel my heart 
beating fast.  I looked down at her body.  Her pajames had slid off a 
bit, revealing a little of her bra.  &lt;Oh, shoot!&gt;  I quickly turned 
away.  &quot;N-no problem.  What are friends for?  It&#39;s not like this is 
the first time I had done it....&quot; I almost slipped out the question 
about Miranda.  I turned to my side of her bed, waiting until the 
lights were turned off.  I closed my eyes and fell asleep.

I opened my eyes and glanced at her digital clock.  It was midnight.  
For some reason I could not go back to sleep.  Crawling as to not wake 
up Courtney, I sat at the edge of the bed and gazed up at the sky.  It 
was full of stars, with a huge full moon.  It reminded me of the time 
my dad took Carl and I out stargazing years ago.  

I was so entranced that I did not notice a pair of arms encircling my 
waist.  Then I felt a body resting against my back.  &quot;Courtney?&quot;  I 
thought she was still asleep.  I had never been this close to her 
before.  &quot;Ginger, what are you doing up?&quot;  she asked softly in my ear.  
It sent chills down my spine.  &quot;I......I couldn&#39;t sleep.  I figured if 
I sat here long enough looking up at the sky it&#39;d make me feel more 
slpeey.&quot;  &quot;Oh.  Ginger, I think now&#39;s the perfect time to make a 
confession.&quot;  Without warning she slipped her hand beneath my shirt 
and kissed my neck.  I could imagine the surprised look on her face 
when I did not struggle.  &quot;Ginger, you knew along?  That this would 
happen?&quot;  Her voice was still soft.  &quot;Yes, Courtney.  I knew for a 
while that you were hinting at me.  I started to realize, but.....I 
wanted to tell you......but.......I guess I was just scared.&quot;

&quot;You were scared?  I was scared that you would not understand.  That 
if you found out you would hate me and isolate me from your life 
forever.&quot;

&quot;Courtney, I could never hate you.  You have always been so good to 
me.  I guess I could return the feelings.  But.......I thought you 
liked Will.  And half the time I was a little mad at you for using me, 
but......I just could never dislike you.   I like you so much.&quot;

&quot;Ginger, I am totally over Will, when the only person who truly 
understands me is you.  I&#39;m so glad you understand my feelings.  I 
won&#39;t ever hurt you again.  It&#39;s true that I have liked you ever since 
junior high.  It&#39;s like you were always on my mind.  Everytime I close 
my eyes I see your face.  I even dreamt about you.  When I told 
Miranda how I felt about you, she took it rather badly.  She&#39;ll 
understand sooner or later.  She just needs time.&quot;  Gently blowing in 
my ear, she reached up and gently touched my breast.  &quot;Oh God, 
Courtney.....&quot;  &quot;Ginger, I want you.  I want you so much.  You&#39;re so 
beautiful under the moonlight.  Let&#39;s.......&quot;  the rest she whispered 
into my ear.  I turned to face her, absolutely stunned.  With a smile, 
she responded, &quot;I&#39;ll show you.&quot;

She unbuttoned her shirt.  It easily slid off her body. Then she 
pulled off her pants.  I stared at her underwear.  I knew her bra was 
black and very silky-looking.  She leaned in closer to me.  &quot;It was 
for you.  Do you like what I&#39;m wearing?&quot;  her voice had a seductive 
tone.  I was dazed.  &quot;Yes, it&#39;s very sexy.&quot;  Smiling, she kissed me 
passionately.  It felt wonderful.  As we kissed I could feel her 
slowly unbuttoning mine.  I wanted to protest, but I felt this is what 
I had always wanted to experience, especially with her.  We broke the 
kiss to admire each other&#39;s body.  &quot;Your body&#39;s beautiful,&quot; she 
whispered, her breath having a flowery scent.  It was intoxicating.  
&quot;Yours is too,&quot; I responded.  She unstrapped her bra, pulled off her 
underwear and tossed it along with the rest of her clothing on the 
floor.  

She kissed me so hard I thought I was going to suffocate.  When she 
broke it I was gasping for breath.  She gently caressed my cheek.  &quot;I 
guess I&#39;m going too fast.  This is your first time after all, right?&quot;  
Still breathing hard, I nodded my head.  She softly kissed down the 
side of my neck.  I moaned in pleasure.  &quot;Courtney, weren&#39;t those some 
pretty expensive clothing you just tossed aside?&quot;  I asked in a soft 
tone.  &quot;They are nothing compared to you, my love,&quot; she responded 
seductively in between kisses.  I closed my eyes and listened to the 
lovely sound of her voice.

She unstrapped my bra and tossed that aside as well.  She stopped 
kissing and lowered her head.  &quot;You have such nice breasts......so 
soft......so round,&quot; she whispered, caressing and giving them a gentle 
squeeze.  I moaned at the feeling.  She pressed her breasts against 
mine, moaning in pleasure, while kissing my shoulder.  She rose her 
hips to grind against mine.  My moaning grew louder and more intense. 
&quot;Ginger.......&quot; she said my name like it was sacred.  She licked at 
them hard, placing her mouth on my right breast and began to suck, 
teasing with her tongue, touching with her teeth.

&quot;Courtney!&quot;  I let out a long moan.  It felt so good.  &quot;Ginger, after 
all you&#39;ve done for me, let me make love to you, let me please you,&quot; 
she whispered, then continued to suck.  My mind was reeling, my heart 
beating faster, I was sweating profusely.  I could not believe this 
was happening.  &quot;Ginger...I&#39;m offering myself to you.....don&#39;t you 
want me?&quot; she asked quietly.  I thought about it. 
&quot;Yes...Courtney.....I do want you.....so much.....&quot; She was pleasing 
me in such a way I never knew was possible.  &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; she spoke 
softly. She sucked on my other breast, doing the same thing to it.  
&quot;You have such a wonderful taste,&quot; she said, licking her lips.  I was 
moaning and saying her name in every breath I could take.  I suddenly 
let out a sharp cry when she gently bit on it.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, did I hurt 
you?&quot;  She gently caressed the nipple with her tongue.  &quot;No....no, 
it&#39;s okay,&quot; I whispered.  

I let her take off my underwear and for the first time in my life I 
knew where my most sensitive area was.  She lowered her head and 
licked inside my vagina.  I moaned even more, arching my back as I 
felt real pleasure surging throughout my body.  &quot;Oh, dear God!&quot;  I 
screamed.  I felt my first orgasm.  &quot;Do you like it?&quot; she asked, her 
head still low.  &quot;Oh, yes, Courtney.  Please, show me more.&quot;  Soon she 
was lashing her tongue deeper within me.  One touch of my clitoris 
sent more intensifying pleasure through me.  I was in such a daze, my 
breath growing more ragged, my eyesight becoming blurred, I was unable 
to contain my sounds of pleasure.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Ginger, just let it all out,&quot; she calmly whispered.  I sat 
on my knees as she kissed and licked my hips and thighs.  She raised 
her head to give me another passionate kiss, whispering in my ear, &quot;I 
love you,&quot; befor kissing the other side of my neck.  

Suddenly, I felt my body release fluids.  &quot;Oh Courtney.&quot;  &quot;Yes?&quot;  She 
stopped to look at my face.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I think I wet your bed.&quot;  
&quot;Ginger, don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t know what you just released?&quot;  I 
shook my head.  To my surprise, she lapped up what came from my body 
on the sheet!  I stared at her.  &quot;Courtney, what the heck.....&quot;  She 
placed a finger on my lips.  &quot;Let me explain.  When I gave you an 
orgasm, your body released what is called cum.  Or in more specific 
terms, what we use to make eggs.&quot;  I was even more surprised.  
&quot;Ooohhh.&quot;  I blushed a bit.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the mess.  You still 
have a wonderful taste.&quot;  She gave me a sexy smile.  &quot;I see you have 
been paying more attention in biology class than I did,&quot; I said 
calmly.  Giggling, she kissed me.  &quot;Ginger, I need to let you know how 
I taste,&quot; she spoke softly.  She grasped my hand and guided it down to 
her vagina.  Without bothering to look I felt my hand getting wet.  
When I brought it to me, it was covered with something sticky.  It had 
a pleasing aroma.  I licked at it.  She looked at me, waiting for my 
answer.  &quot;You also have a great taste, Courtny,&quot; I said with a smile.  

With a wink, she lowered her head and gently kissed my stomach.  
Moaning, all I could do was enjoy what was being done to me.  I felt 
more pleasure surging through me.  She continued licking my clitoris 
with her tongue.  &quot;Oh yes, Courtney......right there......go 
on.....I&#39;m almost there......&quot; I moaned.  She had me over the edge 
with another orgasm.  I let loose a passionate scream of her name.  
She sucked on my vagina even harder.  It was all it took to totally 
drain me of my energy, and then I fainted.

I don&#39;t know how long I was out.  When I opened my eyes, I felt 
Courtney resting her head on my stomach.  I smiled at her.  I reached 
down and softly stroked her blond hair, gently running my fingers 
through it.  &quot;You&#39;re awake.  I hope that wasn&#39;t too much for you.&quot;  
&quot;No, it&#39;s OK.  I&#39;ll get used to it.&quot;  As I continued stroking her, I 
turned to look at the sky, deep in thought.  

She softly moaned at the feeling.  &quot;You have a lovely heartbeat, 
Ginger.  What are you thinking about?&quot;  I was silent for a moment.  
&quot;Junior high.&quot;  I laughed.  &quot;I remember the time I stopped Dodie from 
revealing to the entire school that you had head lice, and when you 
hugged me for the first time.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ginger, an I have never forgotten you for that.  I wanted so 
much to do something even more, more than just that hug.  I have been 
waiting for this moment for so long.&quot;

&quot;I should have known you had other things in mind than just working on 
that project or just not wanting to be alone.&quot;  Then a thought 
occurred to me.  &quot;Courtney, what about Miranda?  And why did you 
choose me?&quot;

She crawled up to lie next to me.  &quot;Do you have to ask?  You&#39;re the 
only one who truly understands me. You taught me that friendship is 
more important than popularity.  Miranda never really understood that.  
She&#39;s still my best gal pal, but.....I love you, Ginger Foutley.  You 
mean so much to me.  I don&#39;t ever want to lose you.&quot;  

I reached out and stroked her cheek.  &quot;I love you too, Courtney 
Gripling.  You&#39;ve given me the greatest pleasure of my life.  I am 
also over Ian.  And I doubt I would ever start a relationship with 
Sasha.  You&#39;ll never lose me.  

&quot;I guess we&#39;ll have to tell everyone else.  They&#39;ll understand, I know 
they will,&quot; she said reassuringly.  I moved in closer and kissed her.

&quot;That&#39;s what I love about you, Courtney.  You&#39;re always looking on the 
bright side of things.  I always wanted to get closer to you, never to 
replace anyone of course, not even Miranda.&quot;

&quot;She will learn to accept this, if it means the end of our friendship.  
Ginger, will you...?&quot;

I knew what she wanted, and she deserved it.  &quot;Sit up.&quot;  I made love 
to her, only with more passion.  I wanted to give her more than what 
she gave me.  She was saying things like, &quot;Oh yes, Ginger......oh 
yes.......right there......please don&#39;t stop.......&quot; I lost control of 
myself for a moment and gave her even more than she could ever handle.  
She was moaning in pleasure, barely having the strenght to do anything 
else.

Finally, she collapsed on the bed, her body glowing in sweat.  I 
hovered over her, pushing back her bangs to wipe away the sweat.  She 
looked at me, smiling.  I smiled back at her. The moonlight shone on 
her face.  &quot;You have such a beautiful face.  I always had the desire 
to touch it, but I thought I could never,&quot; I said as I caressed her 
cheek.  

&quot;Ginger, you can touch me wherever you want.  As long as we&#39;re 
together, I don&#39;t care what happens.&quot;  We looked at each other for a 
moment.  &quot;Ginger, don&#39;t ever leave me, please......&quot; Her eyes began to 
feel with tears.  I gently wiped them away.  &quot;Such a beautiful face 
need not be spoiled by tears.  Hey, BFF, remember?&quot; She smiled again, 
her eyes shining in tears.  We shared one last kiss, more passionate 
and deeper than the last.  &quot;Ginger...&quot;  I placed a finger on her lips.  
&quot;Shhhh........go to sleep, my friend.  You&#39;ve had enough.&quot;  She closed 
her eyes.  &quot;Ginger, I&#39;m so glad I could please you.&quot;  

&quot;Shhhhh......&quot;  I leaned in and gently kissed her forehead.  &quot;Just go 
to sleep.&quot;  I watched as she slept, caressing her face.  My friend, my 
best friend, my lover.  Before I knew it, I instantly fell asleep as 
well.  My last thought was that whatever happened, we would face it 
together.

I heard the calling of my name.  I sat up and saw my friends 
approaching me.  I looked at Courtney who nodded at Miranda and the 
both of them got up.  The next time Courtney invited me over and we 
were alone, it would be my turn to begin.</pre>
