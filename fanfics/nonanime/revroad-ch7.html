<h1>Revenge Road (part 7 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/revroad-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The pink and white car raced along the shoreline,
silver metal flashing in the summer sun as she enjoyed
the feel of wind and water. Reaching the predesignated
point the car swerved, leaping right off the edge of
the road even as it underwent a startling
transformation. Hurtling through the air segments of
machinery shifted, moving and changing until an almost
entirely different being formed.

With a metallic clang Arcee came down on the deck of
Fortress One, the female Autobot rising cautiously as
she stood on the armored aircraft carrier. She looked
oddly like a human female, her robotic design giving
the impression of hips and bust, though like all
Autobots she was also clearly a warrior.

&quot;Welcome aboard Fortress One,&quot; Captain Claudia Grant
smiled as she offered a salute to their honored guest.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Arcee returned the salute, having been
briefed on human military customs. She knelt to be
closer, &quot;Thank you for greeting me, Captain. I&#39;m well
aware of how busy an officer like you must be.&quot;

&#145;Well, well she&#39;s both polite and powerful,&#39; Claudia
thought to herself. &quot;It&#39;s no trouble at all,&quot; she said
then added with a slight smile, &quot;I&#39;m rather looking
forward to having you work with us as a liaison.&quot;

&quot;As are the Autobots,&quot; Arcee agreed. She looked
curious, &quot;I would have expected Commander Hayes or
possibly Officer Randal to meet me.&quot;

&quot;Ah, well,&quot; Claudia actually looked a bit sheepish as
she explained, &quot;actually, they&#39;re both off base for
the moment.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Arcee asked.

&quot;Debriefing with command,&quot; Claudia shrugged.

Arcee nodded, &quot;Ah, I understand. Dealing with high
command can be... interesting.&quot;

Claudia was the one who looked curious this time as
she asked, &quot;I thought the Autobots only answered to
Optimus Prime?&quot;

&quot;On Earth, yes,&quot; Arcee sounded amused, &quot;but on
Cybertron we have to deal with the Autobot High
Council going over everything we do. Field command is
still Optimus&#39; but...&quot;

&quot;Ack,&quot; Claudia made a face, well aware of the sort of
complications an over active command could cause a
field officer.

Arcee paused, looking out at the sea a moment. A bit
hesitantly she asked, &quot;Did Officer Randal recover from
her encounter with Megatron?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s fine,&quot; Claudia reassured her, &quot;if fact, if I
know her she&#39;s probably out getting into some kind of
trouble right now.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Izzy Randal nearly purred as the green
haired young woman circled the plane in the
underground hanger at Area 51, &quot;I want it!&quot;

Commander Vince Grant looked amused, his black hair
cropped close to his head and uniform regulation neat.
&quot;As soon as one&#39;s ready you&#39;re one of the first up to
get them,&quot; he reassured her cheerfully.

&quot;I am impressed,&quot; Izzy murmured as she circled the
modified veritech.

The sleek plane sat on a testing cradle, connections
running from it to a bank of machines. The outer skin
felt slightly different than the usual composite
armor, ringing slightly when she tapped the metal with
her knuckle, and was cool to the touch. The wings had
been swept back slightly, the regular missile mounts
beneath them built up, while underneath the cockpit a
slightly larger autocannon waited for it&#39;s deadly
purpose to be realized. Finally mounted on the
slightly bulkier rear were a set of secondary engines,
twin thrusters that almost seemed to quiver with
restrained power.

&quot;The autocannon&#39;s been modified to handle a new grade
of ordinance,&quot; Vince revealed, &quot;we hope it&#39;ll be more
effective against Decepticon armor.&quot;

&quot;Like Megatron,&quot; Izzy nearly purred.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Vince agreed, &quot;or any of the other new
heavy hitters that have arrived from Cybertron.&quot; He
smiled, &quot;And they&#39;ll have a much harder time shooting
you down again too.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Izzy clenched a fist for a moment, &quot;I&#39;m
looking forward to it.&quot; She looked back at the
boosters, &quot;Are they to improve air speed, or space
shots?&quot;

&quot;Bit of both,&quot; Vince admitted, &quot;they can boost your
air speed, and in a pinch they can be used to achieve
near orbit, but they&#39;re still pretty touchy pieces of
tech.&quot;

&quot;Not perfected?&quot; Izzy raised a eyebrow.

&quot;They&#39;re ready,&quot; a flat voice cut in. Both turned to
see a man in a labcoat enter, his eyes hidden behind
glasses and his manner stiff.

&quot;Izzy Randal,&quot; Vince jumped in, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet
Dr. Emil Lang, our expert on what we&#39;re calling
Robotechnology.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a honor to see you again, sir,&quot; Izzy nodded.

Dr. Lang smiled slightly, &quot;We could just call it
Transformers physiology, but I suspect our Autobot
allies might object.&quot;

&quot;Either that or Gloval would,&quot; Vince noted. &quot;Sorry for
not calling ahead, sir,&quot; he added just a bit
nervously.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Lang flashed a slightly odd smile,
&quot;I had actually hoped to have Miss Randal be one of
our test pilots, but alas her assignments didn&#39;t allow
it.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Izzy admitted, &quot;I would have enjoyed that...&quot;

Before Izzy could continue on they all heard a door
slam up the hallway, hurried steps slowing as they
neared the lab itself. Looking fairly composed
Commander Lisa Hayes opened the door, but something
around her eyes told Izzy she was angry.

&quot;Lisa,&quot; Vince nodded, his own expression stating that
he was quite aware of her mood but was politely not
going to mention it. &quot;I was just showing Izzy around
the latest designs,&quot; he said to her mildly.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Lisa&#39;s smile was a bit forced, &quot;I don&#39;t want
to imagine the sort of trouble Izzy could get into
here on her own.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Izzy protested.

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you, Commander,&quot; Lang nodded, &quot;I had
heard a rumor you might be returning to this
facility.&quot;

A flash of something very like anger appeared in
Lisa&#39;s eyes then was quickly suppressed bu a steely
will. &quot;That rumor has been greatly exaggerated,&quot; she
answered him mildly, &quot;I&#39;m quite happy at my current
post.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what Claudia tells me, too,&quot; Vince agreed
quickly.

Quickly assessing the stress in her friend&#39;s face Izzy
made a snap decision. &quot;I hate to cut the tour short,&quot;
she said, &quot;but we&#39;re supposed to have a VIP at
Fortress One later today. Wouldn&#39;t do for us to be
late.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Lisa quickly agreed. Turning to Vince
she said, &quot;Thank you again for showing her around.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s been a pleasure,&quot; a smiling Vince told Lisa then
added to Izzy, &quot;and I hope we&#39;ll see you again.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll look forward to it,&quot; Izzy told him then she
nodded respectfully to Dr. Lang and said, &quot;thank you,
sir.&quot;

Lisa and Izzy left, both women quiet until they
reached the elevator up to the hangar deck. &quot;Thanks
for getting me out of here,&quot; Lisa said to Izzy
quietly.

&quot;No problem,&quot; Izzy responded as they smoothly rose.
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind my asking,&quot; she asked, &quot;what did
your father do to piss you off?&quot;

&quot;What makes you think it was him?&quot; Lisa asked.

&quot;Who else?&quot; Izzy asked simply.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Lisa half smiled. &quot;My dear father the Admiral,&quot;
her voice had real bite, &quot;wants to reassign me here,
to keep an eye on me. He thinks Gloval&#39;s been a bad
influence...&quot;

&quot;He can&#39;t do that, can he?&quot; Izzy looked alarmed.

Lisa felt oddly touched that she cared. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,
Gloval can override him,&#39; she said, &quot;though I suspect
it&#39;ll make dad hate Gloval even more.&quot;

&quot;Tough,&quot; Izzy said firmly, &quot;we can&#39;t afford to lose
you.&quot;</pre>
