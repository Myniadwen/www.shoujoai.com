<a href="../nonanime/gunfighter-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Bonnie sighed, the beautiful redhead leaning forward
from her place in the back seat as she asked the
driver, &quot;Can&#39;t this thing go any faster?&quot;

The old carrier buggy, a left over from the colonial
wars, bumped and shook as they went over the rough
road away from town. &quot;This is the best it&#39;ll do,&quot;
Larry said, the bartender&#39;s rough black hair falling
into his eyes.

&quot;Do you think he got it?&quot; Mayor Phillips asked with a
frown.

&quot;She,&quot; Bonnie corrected.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Phillips wiped at his balled spot as the
shorter man added, &quot;I guess I&#39;m just used to thinking
of her as a him.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s got a point,&quot; Larry said as he wrenched the
wheel sideways to avoid a Havenite water-lizard, the
large green skinned creature placidly grazing on the
hardy local moss in the path of their buggy.

&quot;Makes me wish I brought my rifle,&quot; the blonde haired
Rei noted as she looked back at the lizard, &quot;them&#39;s
good eating.&quot;

&quot;Rei,&quot; Phillips sighed, &quot;you sound like such a
savage.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei smiled.

Bonnie sighed as she looked her friends over and
asked, &quot;And why are you all coming along, exactly?&quot;

&quot;Well, the carrier buggy is town council property,&quot;
Phillips noted.

Rei sniffed, &quot;It&#39;s only fitting that council members
supervise it&#39;s use.&quot;

&quot;You needed a driver,&quot; Larry shrugged from behind the
wheel. He grinned, &quot;Besides, we had nothing better to
do.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Bonnie fought back a smile, liking how her
friends downplayed their presence. In fact they all
had things to do, but had chosen to take the time to
come out here to greet a returning friend.

The landing pad was just a fused, dense plane of rock,
fused together back when the colony had been founded.
Since then it had seen little use, the road out to the
pad barely maintained as there were few sights to be
seen on this outlying world. They came to a stop on
the edge of the landing field and waited, looking up
into the evening sky.

Beginning as a small spark of light against the blue
sky the vessel slowly grew in size, the rumble of it&#39;s
breaking the sound barrier reaching them in seconds.
The vessel came descended in a howling displacement of
air, steam pouring off of it&#39;s battered outer skin,
the occasional long burn streak marking the surface,
leftover of some battle. It was nearly thirty feet
long, a blocky wedge with it&#39;s atmospheric wings
deployed on either side. On the top and sides blocky
shapes were mounted, looking oddly sinister on the
small craft. The weapons units were each powerful
enough to destroy their buggy with a single shot, yet
were mere pea-shooters compared to that of a real
warship.

&quot;I still find it ironic that she&#39;s called the Sweet
Charity,&quot; Phillips noted as he nodded towards the
deadly craft.

&quot;I think the previous owner had a odd sense of humor,&quot;
Rei noted.

With a loud thump the Charity came to rest, steam
pouring off of it&#39;s surface as the skin of the craft
bled off the energy of atmospheric reentry. Once it
was cool enough the hatch built into the side folded
down into steps and a familiar lanky figure descended
to meet them.

&quot;Well, I wasn&#39;t expecting all of you,&quot; the slim woman
said as she walked down to the group and took a tired
look around , black hair that matched the shirt she
wore. Jan Clark held out the bag marked with the
universal medical insignia, &quot;Got the vaccine.&quot;

&quot;Thank god,&quot; Bonnie sighed happily as she rushed to
the exhausted Jan&#39;s side.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Phillips took the package, &quot;just in time,
too.&quot;

Jan looked between her friend&#39;s faces, studying them a
moment, then she asked soberly, &quot;Who did we lose?&quot;

Rei hesitated, then said sadly, &quot;Heather Gallant
succumbed to the fever the day after you left.
Fortunately, the others are still holding on.&quot;

Jan winced, thinking of the kindly sheriff. &quot;Then
let&#39;s get the medicine back to town,&quot; she said firmly
as they walked over to the old buggy.

An excerpt from the Encyclopedia Galactica, 2345
Edition:

One of the more unpleasant discoveries colonists made
was the constant mutation and change of common and not
so common diseases. A easily curable virus on one
world could mutate slightly in the new conditions on
another world, crippling or killing a colony. Only the
rapid development of vaccines on more advanced worlds
could save the colonies, and if a world lacked a jump
drive equipped ship it could be doomed.

It took a few days before they could catch Jan up on
what happened while she was off getting the medicine.
Heather had supervised bringing in the sick from the
homesteads, and despite her precautions had caught it
as Jan was leaving. In the two week round trip to the
nearest high tech world the fever had ravaged the
woman, leading to her death only days ago.

Jan sighed as she listened to their story, nursing a
synth-beer in the dance hall on the first floor of the
brothel. All of them were tired, having spent the last
few days getting the medicine to the homesteads as
well as vaccinating everyone to make sure this disease
never hit them again. &quot;I should have been here
faster,&quot; she said as she drank.

&quot;You did everything you could,&quot; Bonnie said as she
looked across the table at Jan, &quot;and you know it.&quot;

&quot;Hell,&quot; Angel leaned forward, the dancer and
entertainer barely constrained by her slinky dress,
&quot;no one expected you back till next week. How did you
get the medicine that fast?&quot;

Jan looked a bit embarassed as she mumbled, &quot;Called in
a few favors. It wasn&#39;t much.&quot;

&quot;I bet you did more than that,&quot; Bonnie said quietly,
again astonished at how tender this seemingly tough
gunfighter could be. In the months she had known her
she saw how kind Jan was and how sweet she could be
despite her hard exterior.

Phillip strode inside, the mayor looking visibly tired
too. &quot;The last of the families are heading back home,&quot;
he reported, &quot;it&#39;s finally over.&quot;

&quot;Well, not completely over,&quot; Rei corrected as they
young woman followed him into the dance hall, &quot;we
still have one problem.&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t the time...,&quot; Bonnie started, knowing
exactly where her friend was going and hoping to stop
her.

Jan looked over at Bonnie then towards the newcomers
as she warily asked, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;The now open sheriff&#39;s position,&quot; Phillip took the
bull by the horns, so to speak.

&quot;Huh?&quot; It took Jan a moment to realize who they meant
then her eyes narrowed in anger, &quot;Are you insane?&quot;

&quot;No, actually it makes a lot of sense,&quot; Rei nswered as
the terrified mayor ducked behind her. Calmly she
noted, &quot;You&#39;re well respected, you&#39;ve kept the peace
at the Place well enough, and you&#39;re involved with one
of the pillars of the community.&quot;

Both Jan and Bonnie blushed, while Angel and several
of their coworkers smirked. Sometime after the pair
had become involved one of the girls had walked in on
a romantic moment, so to speak, and faster than you
can say &#145;rumor control&#39; the word had spread all over
town. Surprisingly the community took it pretty well,
especially considering Jan&#39;s capability to kill anyone
who insulted Bonnie.

&quot;If I become the sheriff,&quot; Jan grimly noted, &quot;you&#39;re
going to have idiots coming out of the woodwork to
challenge me. As it is, my working art the Place has
resulted in a few guys who should have known better
being shot.&quot;

&quot;They haven&#39;t tried it in months,&quot; Phillip noted,
&quot;you&#39;ve proven your rep.&quot;

Before Rei or Phillip could continue Bonnie said,
&quot;Give Jan some time to think about it, damn you. We&#39;re
all exhausted and this is no time for decision
making.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Rei conceded, &quot;but we&#39;ll be back to
talk about this tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting,&quot; Jan answered, ner voice not exactly
pleasant.

Bonnie sighed. &quot;Angel,&quot; she looked at the young lady,
&quot;we&#39;re closing for the night. I doubt anyone has the
energy to come here right now anyway.&quot;

&quot;Right boss,&quot; Angel nodded, knowing her boss was in no
mood to argue. &quot;I&#39;ll close up.&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; Bonnie took Jan by the hand and the two
women headed to the stairs up to the room they now
shared. The corner room had started out as Jan&#39;s
alone, rented based on her bouncer duties then, when
Bonnie moved in they made somne changes, including a
larger bed, a wardrobe and a few other essentials.

&quot;I need a bath,&quot; Jan sighed as she took off her shirt
then undid her belt.

&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Bonnie said as she slid up behind her to
kiss the back of her neck, &quot;I like the way you smell.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Jan sighed. &quot;You too,&quot; she turned to kiss
Bonnie lingeringly, &quot;I missed you.&quot;

Bonnie kissed her back, lingeringly. &quot;You don&#39;t have
to be sheriff,&quot; she noted as she undressed, her gown
then underthings hitting the floor.

Jan sighed as she lay down, &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;Why were you fighting then?&quot; Bonnie asked as she laid
down beside her.

A sad smile, &quot;Heather&#39;s barely in her grave, Bonnie.
It wouldn&#39;rt be right to just step into her boots like
that. We need time.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right of course,&quot; Bonnie said as she curled up
to Jan&#39;s side. A pause, &quot;Jan?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Jan looked at her.

&quot;How tired are you?&quot; Bonnie batted her eyes.

Jan grinned as she pulled her close, &quot;Not THAT tired.&quot;
