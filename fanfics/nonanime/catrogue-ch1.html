<h1>The Adventures of Shadowcat and Rogue! (part 1 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Kitty got out of bed, stood up and stretched. She dressed quickly, 
went into the bathroom, combed her straight brown hair and brushed 
away her usually bad morning breath. She sighed softly to herself as 
she quietly opened the door and peeked into the guest room. The small 
bed was tidied up and empty, just like it had been every morning for 
the last two weeks.

Kitty went to the closet, pulled on a jacket over her blue pajamas, 
slipped her boots on and quickly made her way behind the house to walk 
to the abandoned quarry nearby the cabin. As she approached the quarry 
valley, the sound of violently breaking stones grew louder and louder.

Rogue&#39;s muscle shirt and boxer shorts were soaked with sweat, clinging 
to every curve of her body. Her shoulder length red hair stuck to her 
head, only the white streak seeming to have any life to it. She 
punched at the stone wall, her bare fists pulverizing the rock into so 
much dust. Then Rogue drew her arm back, and with a soft &#39;snikt&#39; 
noise, bone claws emerged from her hand. She then ripped into the 
stone with them, cutting and shaping the bare rock with ease.

It still unnerved Kitty a little bit, seeing Wolverine&#39;s claws on 
Rogue&#39;s hands. It was an aspect of her powers that Rogue had only just 
discovered, and she was a little giddy about it. She had shown Kitty a 
few different tricks, each one seeming to delight her more. But Kitty 
did wonder what was going on under that cheery surface.

&quot;There&#39;s coffee ready,&quot; Kitty called out to Rogue as she kept a safe 
distance from any of the flying rock shards. She tried not to stare at 
Rogue, at the sweat steaming off her sexy body in the cold morning 
air. Kitty had always envied Rogue her healthy good looks, truth be 
told. And now she was feeling other things too, when she looked at her 
old friend.

Rogue gestured to the sketched out beginnings of a human face and body 
that she had just carved into the rough stone wall. &quot;What do you 
think?&quot; she asked a smiling Kitty cheerfully. &quot;Am I the next 
Michelangelo?&quot;

&quot;Not too bad,&quot; Kitty said admiringly. The face was only roughly marked 
out, the details that would define who it was were still mostly 
missing. &quot;So who do you think it&#39;s going to be?&quot; Kitty asked her 
curiously.

&quot;To be honest, I&#39;m not that sure,&quot; Rogue admitted. She smiled at Kitty 
happily and asked her, &quot;Did you say there&#39;s coffee?&quot;

They quietly walked together, enjoying the crisp fall breeze in New 
England. &quot;Maine&#39;s lovely this time of year,&quot; Kitty sighed to herself 
happily as leaves fell around them, adding to the thick carpet beneath 
them.

Rogue chuckled softly, &quot;Kitty, if I wasn&#39;t nearly invulnerable, this 
little ol&#39; southern belle would be totally miserable.&quot; She grinned 
over at her, cheerfully adding &quot;I guess I&#39;m just a hothouse flower at 
heart.&quot;

Kitty stuck her tongue out at Rogue, who just laughed at her. &quot;I&#39;m 
just glad it hasn&#39;t snowed early this year,&quot; Kitty remarked, getting a 
look of pure horror from Rogue.

Rogue reached over to stop Kitty, a gentle hand placed on her arm. 
&quot;Seriously,&quot; she said with a shy smile on her face, &quot;thanks for 
letting me stay up here with you.&quot; Rogue then shrugged a bit, 
&quot;Otherwise, I think I would have just spent my leave of absence 
working out in the Danger Room, or something, instead of out here with 
such good company.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t get to see each other as much, since I left the X-Men,&quot; 
Kitty said softly. She smiled over at Rogue fondly as she added, &quot;I&#39;ve 
found I miss you guys, and I&#39;m glad just to catch up with what&#39;s been 
happening with you.&quot;

They went inside, and Rogue went into her room to change clothes while 
Kitty went into the kitchen to get their breakfast dished up on the 
dining room table. The two of them had fallen into an odd pattern, 
these last few weeks here: Rogue had done the heavy labor jobs, Kitty 
the more domestic tasks. It was an oddly pleasant experience for both 
of them. Rogue walked out of the bedroom in one of her black 
bodystockings, a pair of shorts and a T-shirt over it.

Rogue had tried just to wear the black bodystockings alone at first, 
but somehow it made her feel too uncomfortable. It was a bit too much 
like being totally naked in front of Kitty. &#39;I wonder why that bothers 
me?&#39; Rogue thought, then shook her head to banish that difficult 
question.

Rogue stopped in the doorway, sniffed at the air, and then she smiled 
very happily. &quot;Have I said how much I really enjoy your pancakes?&quot; she 
asked Kitty with a broad grin on her face. They sat down together at 
the cabin&#39;s dining room table and dug in with vigor.

The day passed like many of their others, with Rogue experimenting 
with her new abilities outside in the abandoned quarry while Kitty 
stayed indoors working on her many university courses. Kitty was 
already well on her way to obtaining one degree and was also 
considering adding another program, a thought that simply blew Rogue&#39;s 
mind.

Kitty brought a picnic basket full of snacks out for them that 
afternoon, and they shared it sitting together on a small hill that 
overlooked the quarry. &quot;So when did your new gifts kick in?&quot; Kitty 
asked, offering Rogue a sandwich.

Rogue took a generous bite and smiled happily, savoring the flavor. 
Taking a swallow, she shrugged as she explained, &quot;I popped the claws 
in the middle of an emergency. As you can imagine, I totally freaked. 
As far as we can figure, I retain a... &quot; she stopped, and tried to 
find the right descriptive word for what she had in mind.

&quot;Imprint?&quot; Kitty helpfully suggested.

&quot;Imprint,&quot; Rogue agreed with a nod, &quot;of each power I&#39;ve absorbed over 
the years. And now I can call up those imprints at will.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s the downside of this?&quot; Kitty asked her. At Rogue&#39;s one 
raised eyebrow, a wryly smiling Kitty added &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be out here 
practicing with your powers every single day if there wasn&#39;t at least 
one.&quot;

&quot;All my regular abilities are now up for grabs,&quot; Rogue said with a 
small sigh. &quot;I can&#39;t be sure if I&#39;m actually invulnerable unless I 
make sure to turn it on, and so on and so forth. And I still can&#39;t 
touch anybody without risking stealing their powers or memories, maybe 
permanently,&quot; Rogue finally added sadly.

Kitty didn&#39;t add anything to that. What could she say, really? With 
Rogue&#39;s uncontrolled absorption power, the simplest human touch was 
just too dangerous for her to risk. About to say something, Kitty 
stopped dead, as an idea suddenly occurred to her.

&#39;What if her power couldn&#39;t lock on to the person doing the touching?&#39; 
a oddly wide eyed Kitty wondered. She began to run through the various 
possibilities of how to make the idea work, the math involved running 
in a stream behind her open eyes.

&quot;Kitty?&quot; Rogue asked her with a impish smile as she looked over at the 
zoned out girl sitting absolutely still beside her. She then waved her 
hand in front of her face, &quot;Earth to Kitty, hello Kitty, can you read 
me? Hey, Kitty, are you there?&quot; Finally, Rogue gave up on subtlety and 
instead pinched her in the side.

&quot;Oww!&quot; Kitty gasped. She looked over at the very amused Rogue, and 
realized what had happened. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Kitty said, blushing.

Rogue just laughed, &quot;I seem to remember one time you did that while 
you were piloting the Blackbird. Talk about complete and utter panic. 
I&#39;m just glad that you remembered to turn on the plane&#39;s auto-pilot 
first.&quot; Kitty blushed even harder, and put a half of a sandwich into 
Rogue&#39;s mouth to stop any further teasing from her.

&quot;How are things with your parents?&quot; Rogue gently asked Kitty after 
finishing chewing up her mouth full. Kitty&#39;s parents had divorced 
shortly after she joined the X-men full time, and at the time she had 
really taken it badly. Kitty had been extremely angry with both of 
them, and it had taken her a long time to recover.

&quot;I&#39;m talking to them, they&#39;re talking to each other, but other than 
that, it&#39;s all status-quo,&quot; Kitty said with a shrug, munching on some 
chips. &quot;At least we&#39;re not still fighting all the time.&quot; She looked 
over at Rogue and asked something she had been wondering about a long 
time, &quot;What was it like, being raised by a lesbian couple?&quot;

&quot;Raven and Irene didn&#39;t really advertise it,&quot; Rogue said with a small, 
odd smile. She then laughed suddenly as she added &quot;I just thought they 
were roomies and best friends until I accidentally walked in on them 
during a intimate moment when I was, oh, about ten.&quot;

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; a blushing Kitty said with a broad grin. Rogue grinned 
impishly back at her, and they both shared a laugh.

&quot;You would not believe how quickly two grown women, one much older 
than the other, can get themselves dressed when absolutely necessary,&quot; 
Rogue said, chuckling softly. &quot;I think,&quot; she said with a smile, &quot;that 
was when I got my very first real &#39;birds and the bees&#39; talk, too.&quot; She 
grinned at the mental image of a blushing Irene and Raven, both in 
just their bathrobes, trying to reason with the little kid she had 
been.

Kitty passed the bowl of chips over to Rogue. &quot;Speaking of the birds 
and the bees,&quot; Kitty said to her softly, &quot;what&#39;s been going on with 
you and Gambit lately? I sort of expected him to visit you here, or 
something.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re done,&quot; Rogue sighed sadly. She smiled oddly, &quot;To be honest, I 
think I fell for the image he generates, the charming thief, without 
really letting myself see who was actually underneath all that.&quot; She 
sadly munched a generous handful of chips and smiled wryly, &quot;Not a lot 
of depth there, it turned out.&quot;

Kitty reached over to pat her arm a bit awkwardly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I 
asked,&quot; Kitty said sadly, blushing a little. She brightened. &quot;Is there 
anybody new, at least?&quot; Kitty asked her hopefully, looking like a 
typical teenager grilling her friend.

Rogue looked at her, and Kitty was surprised at the depths she saw in 
her dark eyes. &quot;Maybe,&quot; Rogue finally said to Kitty a few moments 
later, as she looked away from her off into the distance. &quot;I guess 
we&#39;ll just have to see.&quot;

They finished their lunch, and as Rogue and Kitty packed up the 
containers, Kitty added &quot;I just got a new video in the mail from a 
friend of mine today. Do you want to sit down and watch it with me 
later tonight?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Rogue agreed cheerfully, &quot;I&#39;d love to watch a movie.&quot; Rogue 
added silently, &#39;With you,&#39; and wondered where that little thought had 
come from. Both in agreement, they separated, with Rogue returning to 
work on her only partially finished carving, and Kitty leaving to 
finish off her own equally incomplete homework.

They ate a light dinner together, and Kitty put the video on 
afterward. &quot;I should warn you,&quot; Kitty said with a little smile as they 
settled on the oversized couch, &quot;it&#39;s an anime tape. The title is 
&quot;Read or Die&quot;, and Stevie says I should really see it, for some 
reason.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know you liked anime,&quot; Rogue said, a bit surprised. &quot;I&#39;ve 
seen some stuff on T.V. before, like Digimon, Cardcaptors, and Sailor 
Moon, of course.&quot; She smiled, &quot;I thought they were pretty cool.&quot;

&quot;The English versions?&quot; Kitty asked her with a little frown. At 
Rogue&#39;s nod, Kitty clutched her chest and groaned loudly, then said 
&quot;You&#39;ve got to see the originals! I&#39;ll ask Stevie to send them, maybe, 
when I write my thank you letter for this tape.&quot;

&quot;Stevie Hunter?&quot; a surprised Rogue said. She then shook her head, 
adding &quot;Our old dance instructor likes anime too? Cool!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s the one who got me into anime, actually. Stevie&#39;s a real old 
school Otaku, back in the betamax era!&quot; Kitty said with a laugh.

After the jazzy starting sequence, Rogue took one look at the image of 
Yomiko&#39;s room and started to loudly laugh, even as Kitty blushed 
furiously. &quot;See anyone you find familiar?&quot; Rogue said with a soft 
chuckle.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t that bad,&quot; Kitty protested, &quot;even in my bookworm phase.&quot; 
They kept watching, and Miss Deep soon appeared to use her powers on 
the very startled Yomiko. &quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot; a grinning Kitty 
exclaimed.

Rogue whistled softly as a sequence highlighting Yomiko&#39;s powers came 
on next. &quot;I didn&#39;t think controlling paper would be a very useful 
power, but it is kind of neat,&quot; she admitted. Rogue smiled at the 
sweet scene where Miss Deep told Yomiko her real name, Nancy, and 
noticed that Kitty was getting a bit misty eyed as well.

They sat and watched all three episodes on the tape, and both sighed 
sadly at the ending. &quot;That was pretty cool,&quot; Kitty said, getting up 
and stretching. Her back made a soft &#39;crack&#39; noise, and Rogue found 
her eyes drawn to the graceful curve that Kitty&#39;s slim body made in 
the dim light of the setting sun.

&#39;God, she&#39;s so good looking,&#39; Rogue suddenly thought to herself, 
looking the pretty girl over. &#39;And I think she doesn&#39;t even realize 
it,&#39; Rogue finished.

&quot;I was a bit surprised by the romantic tension that developed between 
Yomiko and Nancy,&quot; Rogue admitted to Kitty aloud. Kitty smiled at that 
even as she picked up the remnants of their snacks that were scattered 
around the couch.

&quot;It&#39;s not that unusual, really, in anime,&quot; Kitty pointed out to Rogue. 
&quot;You know about Haruka and Michiru from Sailor Moon, right?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;Who doesn&#39;t?&quot; Rogue nodded with a smile. &quot;So,&quot; Rogue asked Kitty 
teasingly, &quot;do you think there&#39;s a Yomiko waiting for you out there, 
Miss Deep?&quot; Kitty, surprisingly, blushed brightly and didn&#39;t answer 
the question. &quot;Uhm, Kitty,&quot; Rogue asked her teasingly, with a impish 
smile on her face, &quot;is there something you wanted to tell me?&quot;

&quot;What is this, a game of Truth or Dare?&quot; Kitty asked, still blushing. 
Rogue smirked, and Kitty grinned back at her. &quot;Ok, go get your pajamas 
on. If we&#39;re gonna do girl talk, I at least want do it as comfortable 
as possible.&quot;

A few minutes later, Rogue wore her long pajamas, and Kitty was in a 
nightie, sitting together on the large bed in Kitty&#39;s room. The walls 
bore quite a few anime posters, one of the few concessions to Kitty&#39;s 
relative youth. A good variety of pajama party style snacks are 
arrayed all around them.

&quot;So, Kitty,&quot; an eager Rogue asked her with a little smile on her face, 
&quot;is there a girl out there, just waiting for you to arrive?&quot;

Kitty blushed as she protested, &quot;I&#39;m not totally innocent, Rogue.&quot; She 
passed the bag of chips over to her, and as they both munched, she 
said &quot;Lately, I&#39;ve had a bit of a crush on a close friend, and I did 
have a relationship with a girl a few years ago.&quot;

&quot;Lady killer!&quot; Rogue exclaimed teasingly. &quot;So who were you involved 
with?&quot; Rogue asked her curiously.

&quot;Illyana,&quot; Kitty confessed very, very softly. Rogue looked over at her 
in surprise, and Kitty blushed and blurted out, &quot;She seduced me, all 
right!&quot;

Rogue thought of the pretty blond girl who had Kitty&#39;s best friend for 
so very long, and felt a sudden stab of jealousy that she struggled to 
push aside. &quot;It must have really hurt, losing her,&quot; Rogue said softly. 
Kitty looked away, her eyes dark.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t easy, when she was finally transformed,&quot; Kitty said softly. 
&quot;She didn&#39;t actually die then, not exactly, but I still lost the girl 
I loved in every way that mattered.&quot; She roughly shook her head, and 
forced a small smile, &quot;But I did get over it, eventually. My run of 
romantic bad luck still continued though.&quot;

&quot;And now you&#39;ve fallen for somebody else?&quot; Rogue asked her gently. It 
hurt, to think of Kitty loving someone else, but Rogue pushed the pain 
aside.

&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s probably totally hopeless for lots of reasons,&quot; Kitty 
said with a brave smile on her pretty face.

&quot;But if you don&#39;t tell her,&quot; Rogue said to her softly, &quot;then there&#39;s 
no chance at all.&quot; Rogue looked at Kitty sadly, &#39;I&#39;m glad she&#39;s in 
love,&#39; she thought. &#39;She doesn&#39;t need a untouchable person in love 
with her, like me.&#39; Rogue realized she cared for Kitty, maybe even 
loved her, and Rogue&#39;s heart ached in anticipation for Kitty&#39;s next 
words.

&quot;That&#39;s... sort of what I&#39;m trying to do,&quot; Kitty said to Rogue gently. 
She then reached out with her bare hand and lightly stroked across the 
shocked Rogue&#39;s cheek. She leaned in and kissed her cheek, firmly.

&quot;How... how on Earth did you,&quot; Rogue started to ask her, and Kitty 
shushed her gently, a bare finger resting against her lips. Again, 
Rogue felt bare skin on her own, a expression she only rarely felt 
before.

&quot;I&#39;m phased, just a little bit,&quot; Kitty said, and kissed Rogue again, 
this time softly on the lips. &quot;Just enough that your power doesn&#39;t 
register me.&quot; They kissed a few moments, then Kitty drew back, &quot;Do you 
want me to stop?&quot;

&quot;Hell no,&quot; Rogue exclaimed happily. &quot;I&#39;m in love with you, Kitty, and 
I thought that I didn&#39;t have a chance with you!&quot;

&quot;I love you, Rogue,&quot; Kitty quietly echoed, and then she gently drew 
Rogue down on top of her on the bed.

Kitty stretched happily, as the dawn&#39;s light came through the bedroom 
window. She turned in the bed and stopped cold. She was lying there, 
alone. &#39;Was it just a dream?&#39; Kitty wondered, but then she noticed a 
piece of paper folded on the pillow beside her.

Good morning, Kitty. I woke up this morning and I knew who&#39;s face I 
had been trying to carve. I didn&#39;t want to wake you (you look so cute 
while you&#39;re sleeping, you know that?) so please come out once you&#39;re 
up. Love, Rogue.

Kitty looked at the note, then hugged it to her chest.

Kitty quickly dressed, pulling on her housecoat and boots over her 
pajamas. A few short moments later, she headed out, carrying two cups 
of steaming coffee for her and Rogue to drink together. She heard a 
soft chipping then silence as she neared the quarry. Rogue came around 
the cliff face and smiled happily as soon as she saw Kitty.

&quot;Kitty,&quot; Rogue sighed happily, walking towards her. Kitty put her cups 
down and they came together in a firm hug. &quot;Good morning, sweetheart,&quot; 
Rogue said softly.

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you too, love,&quot; a blushing Kitty answered, and 
kissed Rogue softly. &quot;I missed you, this morning.&quot;

&quot;It was worth it,&quot; Rogue said softly, taking Kitty&#39;s hand and gently 
pulling her along. They came around the corner, and Kitty gasped in 
astonishment.

The face was hers! Kitty Pryde gazed out of the wall with a mysterious 
smile on her face, part of her body emerging from the stone as if she 
was phasing through it. &quot;I&#39;m not that pretty,&quot; Kitty said in a soft 
whisper.

&quot;You&#39;ve always been to me,&quot; Rogue admitted as she answered her simply, 
taking Kitty gently into her arms. She kissed her gently, but 
lingeringly.

Kitty looked up into Rogue&#39;s eyes, her own brimming with tears. &quot;Will 
you marry me?&quot; Kitty asked, half in jest.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rogue answered Kitty in perfect seriousness, &quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; and 
then she kissed her again, fiercely. She took a small ring from her 
pocket, improvised from some wire and silvery foil from the kitchen. 
&quot;Until I can get you a real one,&quot; she said, slipping it on Kitty&#39;s 
finger.

Kitty chuckled a bit, pulling her own improvised ring out of her coat 
pocket. They shared a quiet laugh as she then slipped it on Rogue&#39;s 
finger. &quot;And that brings up the next difficult question,&quot; Kitty 
sighed, relaxing a little in Rogue&#39;s arms. &quot;Who do we invite to the 
wedding?&quot; she asked with a little smile.

&quot;What?!&quot; Rogue asked, even as she gave her such a surprised look that 
Kitty couldn&#39;t help but laugh.
