<a href="../nonanime/itsumo-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>A gentle hand shook Willow by the shoulder once, then again. It took 
more than a few tries, but she finally opened up her eyes, and looked up 
into Tara&#39;s elfin features.

&quot;There&#39;s something wrong,&quot; Tara said quietly.

Willow shook her head groggily, trying to shed the cobwebs of sleep. She 
could feel it, a sensation like electricity in the air. Dark magic, 
being used not too far away. &quot;I feel it too,&quot; Willow murmured, pulling 
herself up off the couch.

As the sheet fell away, Willow suddenly remembered that she had been 
sleeping in the nude. Tara&#39;s eyes widened, a blush reddened her cheeks, 
but she certainly didn&#39;t look away. Tara bent down to grab the sheet, 
&quot;Here.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Willow covered herself, trying not to feel embarrassed about 
showing everything. &quot;I&#39;ll go get dressed,&quot; she blurted, grabbed her 
clothes, and fled into the bathroom.

&#39;She&#39;s so cute when she blushes,&#39; Tara thought. She had dressed herself 
in jeans and T-shirt before waking her, so she sat down to wait. Things 
were a bit strange between them, but she was confident that it would 
pass.

Willow strode out of the bathroom fully dressed, and then promptly 
stubbed her toe on the couch. Any dignity she may have had left was 
quickly erased by her hopping about, holding her foot, and yelping, &quot;Ow, 
ow, owee!&quot;

Tara fought the urge to laugh, jumping to her feet to help Willow to the 
couch. &quot;Here,&quot; she knelt, cradling Willow&#39;s foot in her hands.

A soft glow appeared around the bruised toe, and in moments the pain was 
gone. &quot;Wow.&quot; Willow blinked, then she looked up to Tara, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;Your welcome,&quot; Tara smiled. She got up and looked around, finding 
Willow&#39;s socks and shoes. &quot;Here you go,&quot; she passed them over.

&quot;Any idea what&#39;s going on?&quot; Willow asked, fighting down a blush as she 
quickly pulled her socks and shoes on. &#39;God, I must have looked dumb,&#39; 
she thought mournfully.

&quot;It feels like witchcraft,&quot; Tara noted, &quot;but.. tainted, somehow.&quot;

Willow narrowed her eyes, standing up and simply... waiting. A soft glow 
appeared around her body, golden fire dancing about to eventually form 
an arrow, directing them. &quot;There,&quot; Willow said softly.

&quot;No spell, no chanting?&quot; Tara blinked, looking at her in surprise.

&quot;For simple magics, I don&#39;t really need to use them,&quot; Willow admitted. 
Softly, she added, &quot;It&#39;s just a matter of will.&quot;

&#39;She truly is a champion,&#39; Tara thought, looking at her lover in awe. 
She had rather expected to have to help Willow reach this stage, but 
instead she had achieved it herself. They both felt it again, a stabbing 
pain, and she growled, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

They followed the bright glow across town, eventually reaching the hills 
just behind the town. They walked together silently, each occupied by 
their own thoughts as they grew closer and closer to the source of the 
darkness.

A soft chanting carried on the breeze to them as they moved cautiously 
towards a clearing. Standing in the center of a burned circle a blonde 
haired woman spoke, her eyes closed as shadows spun and twirled around 
her body.

&quot;Oh no, Amy,&quot; Willow sighed softly.

&quot;Amy?&quot; Tara looked over at Willow in surprise. Her eyes widened, &quot;Amy 
the rat?&quot;

Willow sighed and nodded, &quot;Yes, Amy the rat. Ever since she returned to 
human form, she&#39;s been dabbling in darker magics.&quot; A breath, &quot;But 
nothing this bad before.&quot;

&quot;So how do we handle this?&quot; Tara asked.

&quot;Stop her,&quot; was Willows simple answer, &quot;but hopefully without hurting 
her.&quot; Willow startled Tara by striding out into the clearing, &quot;Hello, 
Amy.&quot;

&quot;Willow!&quot; Amy gasped, looking at her in alarm, &quot;What are you doing back 
in town?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got to stop this, Amy,&quot; Willow said gently, &quot;before you or 
someone else is hurt.&quot;

Tara stood a few steps back, ready to back Willow up. &#39;What on Earth is 
she up to?&#39; she thought, looking at the two women worriedly. Amy seethed 
with dark power, but Willow was just standing there calmly.

&quot;But I want someone hurt,&quot; Amy barked. She scowled, &quot;Everything&#39;s always 
come so easy to you, Rosenburg! But I&#39;ve found a way to match you!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry you feel that way,&quot; Willow continued on softly, &quot;but I had 
thought we worked that out years ago.&quot;

&quot;Liar!&quot; Amy barked, and drew the shadow around her. A few choked words, 
and she threw the bolt at Willow.

&quot;Look out,&quot; Tara gasped, but Willow didn&#39;t even budge.

A gesture and a single word, and she deflected the shadow away. Willow 
was a bit harsher, now. &quot;Amy, you have to stop this,&quot; she sighed.

The blackness rose up like a wave around Amy, her eyes gone pure ebony. 
&quot;Die,&quot; she cried, and like a tidal wave the shadow roared towards them.

Even Willow looked a bit shaken at that. She raised her hands, a simple 
blade in her hands as she chanted a few words. Power flowed outward, and 
a sword of mystic light sliced the darkness in two, breaking the wave.

Tara summoned her mystical fire, and used it to dispose of the remaining 
shadows. She smiled at Willow, &quot;Got your back.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Willow smiled back.

Amy was looking at them in shocked disbelief. &quot;How,&quot; she murmured, &quot;the 
servants of the First promised me power equal to what you used to try to 
destroy Sunnydale!&quot;

Willow sighed softly, &quot;My powers have grown since then, not faded, Amy.&quot;

&quot;And she isn&#39;t alone,&quot; Tara smiled.

Willow surprised Amy by striding towards her. The blonde tried to call 
up her power, but she was too weakened to attack again. Willow put her 
hands gently on her Amy&#39;s shoulders, and the girl blurted, &quot;What are you 
doing?&quot;

Willow began to chant softly, light dancing around the two young women. 
Amy staggered as a tendril of darkness rose from her and disappeared, 
then another. Soon, the dark power was flowing out of her, being cleaned 
in that soft golden light, before it finally slowed to a trickle, then 
was gone, leaving Amy crumpled on the ground.

&quot;Beautiful,&quot; Tara murmured softly. The oppressive feeling was going 
away, and she could almost feel the forest around them breathing a sigh 
of relief.

Finally, Willow gently lay two fingers to Amy&#39;s brow, speaking softly, 
and then she turned to walk over to Tara. &quot;We&#39;re done here,&quot; she said 
softly.

&quot;I&#39;m not done with you,&quot; Amy barked, standing up and trying to throw 
another energy bolt. Nothing happened. She tried it again, her eyes 
wide, then she fell to her knees and weakly gasped, &quot;What have you 
done?!&quot;

Tara had to smile, &quot;You sealed her, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

Willow looked at Amy sadly, &quot;Your powers have been locked away. If you 
do penance, try to make up for using dark magic, the seal should fade 
within a year.&quot;

&quot;Damn you,&quot; Amy snarled, &quot;I&#39;ll find another magician, get it removed.&quot;

&quot;Not likely,&quot; Willow sighed softly. &quot;I put the &#39;justice&#39; symbol on the 
spell, as well as my signature. Any good magician knows my reputation,&quot; 
she smiled grimly, &quot;and the dark ones aren&#39;t foolish enough to risk 
crossing me.&quot;

&quot;Nicely done,&quot; Tara murmured, and the two walked away quietly, leaving a 
stunned Amy kneeling behind them. Tara spoke softly, &quot;I was almost 
afraid you were going to hurt her.&quot;

&quot;Once upon a time, I might have,&quot; Willow admitted. She smiled sadly, 
&quot;But I&#39;ve learned that vengeance only creates more vengeance. Justice is 
much better.&quot; Sounding much more plaintive she asked, &quot;Now can I go back 
to bed, please?&quot;

Tara began to laugh, &quot;Sure, love.&quot;

Tara sat at the small dining table, watching Willow sleeping on the 
couch. She stirred, her eyes opening, and she smiled upon seeing Tara. 
&quot;Good morning,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Tara smiled. She raised her cup, &quot;Tea?&quot;

Willow crawled off the couch, stumbling over to her bags. &quot;Coffee,&quot; she 
sighed. Tara raised an eyebrow and Willow explained, &quot;I lived in 
Seattle, and in that city coffee is king.&quot; She set up a small, two cup 
coffee maker, and started it perking.

Tara sniffed the air, smiling. &quot;I could get used to it,&quot; she laughed.

Willow happily sighed, sipping at her first cup. &quot;What would you think 
about my staying in Sunnydale, oh mysterious guide?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I&#39;d say it&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Tara agreed. More seriously, &quot;The First is 
fighting to be free.&quot;

&quot;Which means we need to be here to make sure that never happens,&quot; Willow 
agreed. After another drink of coffee, &quot;Beside, with the airport nearby 
I can get to wherever I need to go as a mystical champion.&quot;

&quot;And,&quot; Tara said quietly, &quot;what about us?&quot;

&quot;I love you,&quot; Willow smiled. &quot;The new body is going to take some getting 
used to,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but I don&#39;t think I ever stopped loving you.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Tara whispered, reaching across the table to put her hand on 
Willow&#39;s. &quot;Do you remember what I promised you?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;Itsumo,&quot; Willow smiled back, gently squeezing Tara&#39;s hand, &quot;forever.&quot;

&quot;Itsumo,&quot; Tara agreed, leaning across the table to kiss her gently.

Author&#39;s Notes: The end, at least for now. I&#39;m leaving this open, so if 
I&#39;m inspired to write additional chapters I can. Hopefully, I haven&#39;t 
made any horrible mistakes here, but if I have let me know, and I&#39;ll try 
to fix them.
