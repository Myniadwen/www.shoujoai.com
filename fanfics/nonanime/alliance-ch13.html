<a href="../nonanime/alliance-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Alias, the Spider: Two

Teresa Ludlow-Dalt paused as the black haired woman checked the Gotham 
City street, covertly looking for trouble. In the months since the 
followers of the Seven Soldiers had begun to target her she had quickly 
learned caution, as well as developing other survival skills. The false 
Soldiers had attacked her at least once a week for the past while, both 
unarmed and armed, but so far she had survived the madmen&#39;s interest.

&#39;Of course,&#39; Teresa mused as she entered the local caf&eacute;, &#39;this probably 
isn&#39;t the brightest idea I ever had....&#39; Within there was a soft murmur 
of conversation as men and women sat at wooden tables, old fashioned 
ornaments decorating the large room.

Sitting at a side table Pat Dugan&#39;s red hair was thinning but he looked 
much younger than he should have been, probably due to the time jump 
that Teresa had heard about. A original member of the Seven Soldiers as 
Stripsey Pat had fought beside the Spider, and was one of the few first 
hand sources still available. Of course, that was assuming he&#39;d even 
talk to her.

&quot;Mr. Dugan?&quot; Teresa asked softly as she arrived at the table, &quot;I&#39;m 
Teresa Ludlow-Dalt, I called you earlier?&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Pat nodded respectfully as he waved her to a seat opposite him. 
He looked at her thoughtfully, &quot;Now, I understand you&#39;re writing a 
book?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Teresa took a seat, &quot;my tentative title is Black Sheep Family, 
the rise and fall of the Ludlow clan.&quot;

&quot;Tom Ludlow, The Spider,&quot; Pat nodded in recognition, frowning. &quot;What do 
you know about him?&quot; he asked.

Before she could answer a waitress arrived to take their orders, then 
the slim blonde hurried away. Teresa sighed, &quot;Not as much as I&#39;d like. 
He was a smuggler, kidnapper and murder who used the Spider identity to 
eliminate rivals to his business.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Pat stirred his coffee, &quot;problem is, he was pretty damn clever 
about it. He certainly had me and the others fooled!&quot;

&quot;What was he like to work with?&quot; Teresa asked.

&quot;A bit too nice,&quot; Pat admitted, &quot;there was always somethin&#39; off about 
him.&quot;

Teresa looked thoughtful as she asked, &quot;And that didn&#39;t make you 
suspicious?&quot;

Pat barked a laugh, &quot;Lady, all of us were hiding things about ourselves, 
it was part of being a costumed hero.&quot; He chuckled as he added, &quot;I acted 
very different in costume, as did most of us, I think to try to maintain 
our secret identities.&quot;

&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Teresa conceded the point. She leaned forward, &quot;What 
cases did you work with him on?&quot;

&quot;Fighting Black Star, the Dummy, a earlier fight with the Iron Hand...,&quot; 
Pat chuckled at the look on her face. &quot;Yeah, they were pretty goofy 
sounding.&quot;

&quot;Considering we have a villain named Poison Ivy,&quot; Teresa smiled back as 
she took a drink, &quot;we really can&#39;t laugh.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Pat grinned just as a large window facing the street 
exploded inward.

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Teresa muttered as she grabbed Dan and yanked him down even 
as she kicked the table over for cover.

&quot;Die, betrayer!&quot; the man in the high tech suit yelled as he climbed in 
through the broken glass, his wrist mounted blasters firing.

&quot;Who&#39;s this joker?&quot; Pat demanded as blasts began to eat away at the 
table.

&quot;Part of a group of nuts trying to avenge the Seven Soldiers,&quot; Teresa 
answered as she pulled a mini-crossbow from where she hid it in her 
purse. &quot;They&#39;re after me because I&#39;m related to the Spider.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me,&quot; Pat blinked.

&quot;Nope,&quot; Teresa answered as she loaded a steel bolt into her weapon. 
&quot;Stay here,&quot; she ordered as she rolled out from cover.

The man in armor gleamed silver, covering him from head to toe. A black 
visor protected his face and the segmented armor almost reminded one of 
a high tech knight. Unlike a real knight, however, he had weapons 
mounted on each wrist, advanced energy blasters of some kind.

&quot;In the name of the Shining Knight,&quot; he boldly said as he fired off 
another energy bolt in Teresa&#39;s direction, &quot;die!&quot;

&#39;These guys sound like a broken record,&#39; Teresa thought as she fired 
back, sending the crossbow bolt zipping right into one of the seams of 
the armored shoulder.

&quot;Aiee!&quot; the man yelped, flailing at the sudden pain as he tried to grab 
at the arrow shaft.

&quot;What a maroon,&quot; Pat muttered as he charged forward, slamming into the 
armored figure with his shoulder and sending him staggering backward.

Teresa kicked him in the gut, glad the armor wasn&#39;t more reinforced. 
&quot;Exactly,&quot; she agreed, watching him double over in pain.

&quot;More coming,&quot; Pat noted as he looked out the window.

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Teresa picked up a chair and swung it, bashing the armored 
figure right out the window at their approaching foes. &quot;Out the back?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Pat agreed as they ran through the stunned caf&eacute; and out the 
back door. He pulled out a small device and pressed it, a red light 
glowing brightly as they looked around.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Teresa asked as they emerged into a smelly, littler lined 
alley and ran up towards a busy street.

&quot;Justice Society signal device,&quot; Pat answered as they came out onto a 
sidewalk, &quot;I&#39;m a reserve member.&quot;

Teresa looked both ways, frowning as she saw no immediate sign of their 
attackers. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, &quot;but I really hope we won&#39;t need them.&quot;

Gunfire rang out as both ducked as a man dressed in a skin-tight red 
bodysuit charged across the busy street, firing twin pistols. &quot;Die, 
betrayer!&quot; the Crimson Avenger wannabe yelled as car&#39;s squealed their 
tires to avoid hitting him.

&quot;If my old buddy saw this guy he&#39;d be ashamed,&quot; Pat muttered resentfully 
as they ducked behind a car parked on the side of the road.

&quot;What&#39;s with the yellow fin on his head?&quot; Teresa asked as she loaded her 
crossbow.

&quot;We all make mistakes occasionally,&quot; Pat answered wryly.

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Teresa conceded. &quot;I&#39;ll distract him, can you...?&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Pat said confidently as Teresa broke from cover.

Moving quickly Teresa ran from Pat, firing her crossbow to try to wing 
the attacker. Crimson Avenger dodged and altered his course, apparently 
not caring that Pat was now behind him. &quot;Come on,&quot; Teresa challenged, 
trying to keep him focused on her.

&quot;For the seven!&quot; Crimson Avenger took aim only to jerk as a arm grabbed 
him from behind. He shifted a bit then his eyes widened, &quot;You?!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, me,&quot; Pat scowled, &quot;you know who I am?&quot;

&quot;Stripsey,&quot; the Crimson Avenger look at him in shock, &quot;one of the 
original seven!&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Pat scowled, &quot;an&#39; there&#39;s no way in hell any of my old buddies 
would have approved of you chasing this girl, damn it.&quot;

&quot;But... she&#39;s a Ludlow!&quot; Crimson Avenger said weakly.

&quot;Yeah, and she&#39;s not responsible for her da,&quot; Pat said to him firmly as 
he coldly slugged the guy unconscious.

&quot;Think that&#39;ll change his mind?&quot; Teresa asked as she put another bolt 
into her crossbow.

&quot;No,&quot; Pat conceded, &quot;but we gotta try.&quot;

&quot;Ye-haw, cowpokes!&quot; a voice yelled as a lasso was whipped towards them.

&quot;You have GOT to be kidding,&quot; Pat muttered as a cowboy dressed Vigilante 
stand-in sauntered up, a old fashioned pistol in hand.

Vigilante twirled the lasso with one hand as he drawled, &quot;Which one of 
you varmits wants to get it first?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Teresa calmly shot Vigilante&#39;s hat off then met his eyes 
coldly, &quot;the next shot goes about a inch lower.&quot;

Vigilante had frozen with the first shot but brought his pistol hand up, 
&quot;Why you....&quot;

The kick in the nuts took him by surprise, causing him to collapse with 
a whimper to the ground. &quot;Not that&#39;s just fighting dirty,&quot; Pat noted 
admiringly.

&quot;Seven against two isn&#39;t exactly fair, either,&quot; Teresa said with a smirk 
as she gave Vigilante another kick for good measure.

&quot;Hey, pat!&quot; a woman&#39;s voice called out and Pat grinned.

Descending from the sky was a girl dressed in blue, red and white, 
carrying a glowing staff with a hooked end. Her blonde hair fell around 
her face as the light shone of the white stars on her costume. &quot;About 
time, Star Girl,&quot; Pat grinned, &quot;what took you?&quot;

Star Girl dropped to the pavement, standing a little shorter than Teresa 
herself. &quot;We were rounding up the rest of these guys,&quot; she gestured to 
Vigilante, &quot;they had a whole team getting ready to move in on you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; Teresa smiled, a little disturbed over being 
rescued by a kid younger than she was.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Star Girl grinned. She looked her over, &quot;I notice 
you&#39;re not in costume?&quot;

Teresa chuckled, &quot;You know about the whole Spider thing, huh?&quot; She 
shrugged, &quot;I haven&#39;t quite mastered the whole quick change thing yet.&quot;

&quot;Maybe I can ask Flash to give some tips?&quot; Star Girl winked.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I could manage joking with him,&quot; Teresa admitted, 
thinking about the well respected older hero.

&quot;We all put our pants on one leg at a time,&quot; Pat offered as they joined 
in with the others rounding up the false Seven Soldiers.

To be continued....

Notes: I had been meaning to catch up with Teresa earlier, but the 
plotline didn&#39;t allow it. Ironically, the growing attacks by the fake 
Seven Soldiers have actually been good training to her, and she&#39;s 
getting quite capable combat wise.
