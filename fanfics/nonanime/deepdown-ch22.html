-Hotaru&#39;s POV-

I finished with my preparations some time later, very surprised that I 
hadn&#39;t heard any complaining from the wench down the hall. That wasn&#39;t 
really fair; I&#39;m certain there are wenches a lot nicer than one Hino 
Rei. Still, I bet there isn&#39;t a person alive who has a touch that&#39;s like 
a flame but not near as harsh. The tea cup in my hand threatened to fall 
from my weakened grip and I shook my head, clearing it of such thoughts.

Setting the cup upside down on the saucer, I placed both on the prepared 
tray and stood back to admire my work. A bowl of ramen, a bowl of soapy 
water, a kettle of tea, the teacup and saucer, and a towel adorned the 
wooden tray. I hoped that she wouldn&#39;t become too suspicious, although I 
used to do things like this for her a lot, so maybe she&#39;d be expecting 
it. I crossed the kitchen and pulled out a plastic bag, filling it with 
ice and wrapping it in a clean towel.

Tucking the wrapped bag of ice between my arm and body, I picked up the 
tray and headed out of the kitchen and down the hall. As I neared the 
hell bitch&#39;s room I could hear the faint sound of snoring and a smile 
crossed my face. For the perfection that Rei tried to lay down, she was 
the most annoying sleeper out of all of Juuban. Aside from the snoring, 
she tended to kick off the covers and thrash around in her sleep.

There were many times I&#39;d be pushed out of bed in the middle of the 
night.

I tiptoed into the room-the padding of my feet masked by the buzz saw in 
the bed-and set the tray down on the desk. This was my chance, I could 
search and get the evidence while Rei was sleeping and then get the hell 
out of here. I headed over to the closet, as I knew that was where the 
raven haired beauty kept her manga stash; it was the first place I could 
think of and I knew that neither Grandpa Hino nor Yuuichiro ever entered 
in here. Its likely Rei would have put it between a couple of the books.

The closet door squeaked loudly when I opened it and I froze; the 
snoring behind me had stopped at the sound and I quickly and quietly 
moved away from the door, looking back at the bed. Rei&#39;s eyes were still 
closed and her body lay limply on top of the covers, her foot propped up 
on a pillow. I frowned at the deeply swollen ankle, which was turning a 
shade of purple and streaked with dark blues. She hadn&#39;t broken it, I 
knew that much, but she still wouldn&#39;t be able to walk on it for several 
days.

Nevertheless, I&#39;d bet my camera that Rei would be looking forward to the 
pain of the ankle when she arrived at school the next day and had to 
face Ami again. Then two days after that Makoto would come back and no 
doubt immediately sense something awry and shit would truly hit the fan. 
I groaned inwardly. The snoring resumed a few seconds later and I 
exhaled the breath I was holding.

I turned back around and opened the closet door the rest of the way, 
wincing at every small squeak. After several minutes of searching 
through the endless stacks of books, then inside garment boxes, and even 
through the clothes on the hangers, I exited the closet frustrated and 
clueless. It had to be somewhere in this room and if I had to search the 
entire area with a fine pick comb, I would do it in a heartbeat.

My only obstacle was the grating engine on the bed; who knew how long 
she would sleep before she found me and kicked me out. Shrugging that 
thought to the side, I proceeded to check the desk... not there. I went 
to the nightstand, checking the drawer in it... not there. I crawled 
under the bed, running my fingers along the sides of it and under the 
edge of the mattress... not there.

The only place left was the dresser. I looked back at Rei&#39;s sleeping 
form. Her head was on a light yellow pillow, tilted slightly so that it 
was facing me and her raven tresses fanned out making her look like a 
dark angel in the sunlight. I was on my knees next to the bed and 
unconsciously reached out to pick the leaves out of her hair. I caressed 
her face with my eyes, recalling how her ruby red lips ravished my 
nipple or the way her brow furrowed in concentration as she pleasured me 
with her fingers, digging deep into the best spots and making me cry out 
her name over and over.

And her eyes, lavender eyes which brimmed with such fire and intensity I 
thought she&#39;d burn holes through me. I often wished she could. Sweet hot 
pain mixed with pleasure, punishment filled with love; I could never get 
enough. But she obviously did. I narrowed my eyes at her in contempt, 
giving a nasty look to her relaxed face. Promises of love and forever 
thrown away in an act of lust; maybe I could have forgiven her, but she 
acted as though I should have expected it all along.

I pulled my hands back and rubbed at my face, growling softly. Somewhere 
in my deep thoughts the snoring had stopped-I hadn&#39;t noticed at all 
until a voice brought me out of my reverie.

&quot;Mm&#39;what the hell? You&#39;re still here?&quot; There was something I hadn&#39;t 
heard in a long time: Rei&#39;s sleepy voice. It always sounded as though 
she had just woken from the deepest slumber possible. It had certain 
innocence about it as well and for all the toughness the fiery tempered 
girl put up, listening to her sound so vulnerable was enough to make 
anyone&#39;s icy heart melt.

Well, almost anyone&#39;s.

I narrowed my eyes at her, giving her the coldest stare I could muster, 
&quot;Yes, I brought you your ice pack.&quot; Rising to my feet, I went over to 
the desk and grabbed the towel wrapped bag of ice, throwing it on the 
bed next to Rei. &quot;I also thought you might be hungry and made some 
soup.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not hungry,&quot; she replied as she sat up and placed the ice on her 
ankle, inhaling sharply as she did so. With a shrug, I picked up the 
bowl of soapy water and towel and went back over to the bed, sitting 
down on the edge of it. Ignoring the suspicious look from Rei, I dipped 
the towel into the water, wringing most of it back out. I went to work 
on the dirt stains on her calves, scrubbing them gently and trying to 
ignore how soft and perfect the tanned skin was when my fingertips 
brushed against it.

&quot;Heh, you always were like this. Always going above and beyond trying to 
take care of everyone here at the shrine,&quot; I noted her voice was much 
less harsh but instead sounded weak and broken. She was obviously 
attempting to rouse my anger; but all I could feel was pity and sadness. 
No matter how big a grudge I held against her, being rejected still 
sucked, especially since Rei was so intensely &#39;in love&#39; with Ami.

I finished with her legs and grabbed her wrist to clean her arm. Without 
warning, I felt heated fingers wrap themselves around my own wrist and 
tug me forward so that I was now half on top of her warm body. The bowl 
went falling to the floor but I didn&#39;t care because at the moment I was 
locked in by the dwindling flame in those lavender eyes. Nothing was 
said as she leaned in for a heated and searing kiss.

She was desperate against my lips, kissing as though she was searching 
for something, and the heat that usually came from them seemed like a 
mildly warm day compared to the volcano I remembered. But despite that, 
it was still a damned good kiss; I found her tongue forcing itself into 
my mouth and I accepted gratefully. We clashed, tongue against tongue 
and I felt her arms encircle my shoulders, holding me tightly against 
her.

It was bittersweet. The one I desired for so long but despised to the 
core for her actions; it was physical gratification melted with the 
twisted animosity of being lied to. I wanted to pull away, but kept 
pushing for more as my hands slid down her body, the towel tossed aside 
with the bowl. She pulled at me and I responded by shifting, climbing up 
on top of the sexy, curvy body and straddling her hips. We never broke 
the kiss during all of this and the work I was doing with my hands on 
her sides and stomach was being well received with soft moans.

Finally, many eons later, we pulled apart, gasping and panting heavily. 
Her hands quickly went to the hem of my shirt, tugging at it, but I 
slapped them away and pinned them up over her head, looking heatedly 
into her burning eyes. It pleased me to see the once dwindling flame now 
burning healthily again. As a gesture in return for that fire, I rocked 
my hips against hers, eliciting a soft deep growl from within.

I held her hands above her head, contemplating the sudden change in 
direction. I was supposed to be getting that damned envelope and its 
contents, not having sex with an ex I hated to the core. From below, Rei 
pushed upwards, pressing her chest against mine; my eyes closed 
unconsciously and I bit my lip to keep from responding. Even though I 
could not see, the smirk on her face was as evident and clear as 
priceless crystal in the sunlight.

&quot;You always did try to orchestrate our lovemaking...&quot;

My eyes opened and I scowled at her, &quot;Lovemaking? More like fucking, 
right?&quot; I let go of her hands and went to move off the bed, only to be 
stopped by her hands on my hips. They began to stroke up and down my 
thighs, pressing softly against the black cotton of my long skirt. It 
felt good and I knew I had to stop it, so I grabbed hold of her wrists 
again and held them in place.

But her fingers wouldn&#39;t listen as they kept dancing across the fabric, 
pressing gently into the muscle and skin below. Between my legs, I could 
feel my own arousal squishing against my underpants. The envelope was 
the furthest thing from my mind at the moment and I let go of her 
wrists, attacking the bottom of her tank top and yanking it upwards. She 
helped me by sitting up, lifting her arms over her head and in a flash I 
had Hino Rei, the sexiest girl at Juuban, half naked in front of me.

Her breasts jiggled in front of me, as though happy to be free; I 
attacked them with my mouth and kissed and sucked between them, nibbling 
over to her right breast and taking her nipple into my mouth. She moaned 
softly, &quot;Oh yeah, Vampire-chan, suck them.&quot;


The provocation only fueled my desire and I bit down on her nipple, 
though not hard enough to draw blood. Above me, I heard a hiss and a 
soft slap on my arm, &quot;That hurt damnit.&quot; I merely rolled my eyes and 
kissed my way over to her other breast, giving the same ministrations I 
had done to its twin. Meanwhile, my hands roamed down to the top of her 
skirt, my fingers dipping just inside of it, caressing the soft skin 
below.

I brought my hands up suddenly, holding the nipple between my teeth and 
pushed on her shoulders so that the small nub was tugged out from my 
teeth. She cried out softly, though still grinning like a Cheshire cat. 
It pissed me off seeing her so happy like this. I climbed off her and 
unzipped the side of her short skirt, pulling it down her legs and 
carefully over her swollen ankle.

All that was left on my raven haired beauty was a pair of red silk 
panties. I climbed up between long tanned legs and pressed my nose 
against them, inhaling deeply. Rei always smelled like incense, even 
down there; I figured it was because she spent so much time sitting in 
front of that fire. Hell, she even tasted like it too.

&quot;Mm, yeah, you always did like to give it first. You were never like the 
others... I always considered you above them.&quot; Her voice was husky, 
teasing, and yet, filled with wanton desire. The weakness it held 
earlier seemed to have dissipated into thin air. I couldn&#39;t punish her 
for this, though, because she was right: I always gave it to her first. 
My desire for claiming her body as my own always outweighed any other 
sexual desire I might feel.

So I didn&#39;t respond and took the panties, yanking them down her legs and 
ripping them. I thought she would say something about it, but she just 
lifted her legs to help me get them off. Once they were over her feet, I 
tossed the torn fabric somewhere behind me and pushed my way back onto 
the bed, knocking the icepack onto the floor. My lips found her calf and 
I forcedly kissed up her leg, spending a particularly long time on her 
knee, nibbling and biting at it.

When I heard an impatient growl from above, I grinned triumphantly and 
moved back up between her legs. A patch of dark hair faced me; I 
unconsciously licked my lips. Chancing a look, I peaked upwards to find 
smoldering lavender eyes watching me with such desire that my own skin 
began to grow hot, almost as hot and searing as the skin beneath my 
fingertips.

I leaned forward, dipping my tongue into the dark curls and running it 
up and down, tasting the incense, smoke, and arousal. My eyes never left 
those above me as I pushed farther in and I smiled when I saw Rei tilt 
her head back, moaning heavily. She finally dropped her head down to the 
pillow and I lost eye contact. It didn&#39;t deter me though, as I continued 
to taste, stroke, and lap the soft wet skin. I felt a pair of hands run 
through my hair, pulling and holding me as close as they could get me.

Thigh&#39;s wrapped around my head and the only senses I could use fully 
were now my touch and taste. And taste I did. I licked and sucked, 
pushing deeper inside and finding all the sensitive places I&#39;d come to 
memorize so many months ago. The heat emanating from Rei seeped down my 
throat, spreading to all parts of my body and my hands found her 
breasts, desiring more of the sweltering fire. I fondled her and rolled 
her nipples between my fingers, and along with my tongue, I brought her 
to a crashing orgasm.

Even though my ears were covered, I could hear a loud scream; I smiled. 
The body beneath me became stiff for several seconds before finally 
relaxing and turning into jelly. I continued to lap until I cleaned the 
raven haired beauty completely and then rested my chin on her thigh, 
watching as her chest rose up and down quickly. She was always beautiful 
and sexy, but never more than when she just came. Sweat glistened over 
her body making her sparkle in the early afternoon sun.

I was barely aware of the hands still stroking my head, fingers running 
through my short dark hair. They trailed down to the collar of my shirt 
and tugged me upwards. Of course, I complied. She pulled at my shirt and 
I helped her by taking it off myself. Lying down on top of her, she 
grabbed the back of my neck and drew me in for a deep, rough kiss. I 
felt her moan and I knew she was getting off on tasting herself on me.

Her other hand worked its way under my skirt and between my legs and I 
broke away from the kiss. &quot;You can&#39;t, you&#39;re injured.&quot; She merely rolled 
her eyes at me.

&quot;Only my ankle,&quot; she replied. Her eyes smoldered, &quot;And besides, I can 
top from below.&quot;

I swallowed, knowing I should just gather my things and go now, but my 
own arousal was no doubt evident as she slipped a finger under my 
panties, pinching the soft flesh harshly. Biting back a whimper, I 
considered my options. Stay here and fuck some more, or leave with what 
little dignity I have left in tact.

But the envelope.

I cursed silently as I gave into the exotic beauty beneath me.

------------------------------------------------------------

-Meanwhile, at the hospital...

Ami stood outside the door, staring at the number for who knows how 
long. She had made her way into the hospital, after cleaning up and 
looking as presentable as possible, and found her feet taking her to 
this door. This was the same door she stood outside when she followed 
Makoto to find out who Miki was; the same door in front of which she&#39;d 
had her panic attack just over a week ago. A frown crossed the blue 
haired girl&#39;s face.

Her eyes drifted down to the knob and she felt herself willing her arm 
to grab it. It was a bit of an effort, but she managed to grasp the 
metal balll between her fingers and turn. The blue haired girl took a 
deep breath, feeling rather drained physical, but mentally very 
energized. She counted to three and then pushed the door open, her eyes 
becoming a bastion of sadness at what was inside.

A young blue haired boy lay in the hospital bed; his head had bandages 
wrapped around it, covering his left eye. He was hooked to a ventilator 
and what one could see of his face, was heavily bruised. Ami deduced he 
must have been beaten badly to look so terrible. She pushed the door 
closed behind her and walked up to the side of his bed, staring 
forlornly at him. He looked young, maybe 13 at the most.

Confusion spread through the genius&#39; mind. This boy was obviously 
comatose; so why was Makoto so excited to visit with him. It wasn&#39;t like 
they would be able to correspond. And if he was close to her in some 
way, wouldn&#39;t there be sadness in the rogue&#39;s eyes in coming to visit 
the boy. Ami frowned deeply, a crease showing between her eyebrows.

&quot;He came in about a month ago. A transfer from Kyoto; they couldn&#39;t take 
care of him and since he had no parents or relatives, they sent him 
here.&quot; Ami turned around to find Mamoru standing the door way, his arms 
crossed over his chest and his eyes narrowed. He looked like he was 
about to admonish the small girl for being here without permission, but 
shrugged it off and instead decided to check the vitals on the frail 
boy. &quot;Didn&#39;t expect to see you here, I figured you&#39;d be home taking care 
of your mom.&quot;

He was smiling charmingly at the teen, but faltered when he saw the look 
of disbelief on her face.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with mother?&quot; Ami tensed. Her mother was supposed to be in 
at work today, but she wasn&#39;t. And taking care of her? She deduced that 
the woman must be sick, then.

The dark haired student doctor shrugged, &quot;She called in sick. But 
knowing her, she&#39;s probably trying to catch up on all the paperwork from 
the last week. Since they haven&#39;t chosen a head ER doc yet, they&#39;re 
simply shuffling all the work to her, on top of what she already has to 
do.&quot; He frowned, &quot;You didn&#39;t know she was sick?&quot;

Ami&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;I was at a friends last night and just left only a 
few hours ago.&quot; Her chest swelled in pain as she remembered what 
occurred earlier and the short girl quickly looked away, meandering 
towards the window. &quot;I should get home and take care of her.&quot; Even 
though she said that, she made no move to go.

She had it all figured out anyhow: her mother was with Setsuna. There 
was no other explanation as the doctor took good care of her body and 
watched her diet, she rarely, if ever got sick. And even those few times 
she had, Ami noted her mother would still go into work, even if it meant 
she stayed cooped up inside the office all day.

&quot;Always the good daughter,&quot; Ami could sense the smile on his face 
through his voice and she furrowed her eyebrows, but forced a smile onto 
her face and turned around. &quot;So you&#39;re visiting young Miki here for 
Makoto-san? I didn&#39;t see her in this weekend.&quot;

The blue eyed girl shook her head, &quot;No, well, maybe.&quot; She giggled a bit 
when Mamoru raised an eyebrow at her, &quot;I just wanted to check up on... 
Miki is all.&quot;

He took the poor excuse with a smile and leaned against the wall, 
watching the young teen from across the room, &quot;Makoto-san is the only 
one who visits him. She&#39;s not even a relative but she appears very 
faithful to helping him recuperate. That girl, she sort of reminds me of 
you, at least in her sense of dedication.&quot;

Makoto is nothing like me. She&#39;s strong and does whatever is in her 
heart... I&#39;m weak and run away when confronted with a problem. Ami bit 
back the tears and smiled again, nodding her head in thanks to the... 
compliment.

Her gaze drifted over to the young boy in the bed and she felt the smile 
melt away, &quot;What exactly happened to him?&quot;

Mamoru sighed, &quot;Gunshot through the head, went in through the eye. How 
the hell he managed to survive in beyond me.&quot; He gestured to the bruises 
on Miki&#39;s face, &quot;Those, they think, happened a few days before the 
gunshot. They&#39;re not healing up very well as you can see. He&#39;s got a 
dangerously low blood count. Doc says it&#39;ll be any day now.&quot;

Ami&#39;s heart went out to the boy and she hoped he managed to pull 
through, for Makoto&#39;s sake. He was special to the rogue and the genius 
vowed to protect him. She wasn&#39;t even considering what the tall teen was 
involved with (seeing as how Miki had been shot, it was sure to be 
something extremely dangerous), she didn&#39;t consider how Makoto knew him, 
and she didn&#39;t even stop to consider why she suddenly so desperately 
wanted to take care of things dear to the tomboy.

All she knew was that she wanted to do this. Makoto had told Ami to do 
what she wanted and not what was required. And she decided to use that 
advice here: she wanted Makoto. Whether or not the chestnut haired girl 
would take her after her actions, was another story.
