<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 39 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../nonanime/supergirl-ch38.html">Back to Part 38</a><pre>It appeared just beyond the orbit of Pluto, a massive shape emerging
from the blackness of space. The size of a small world it was built
entirely of technology, gleaming metal shining as it casually swept
by the outer world on it&#39;s journey to Earth.

As it did so alarms rang out across the blue world as people finally
accepted that it was really coming. In the halls of power hasty
debates over action raged, some affraid a strike might anger their
new foe while others wondered if it would be effective at all. On
the streets as word leaked out there was a panicked rush to escape,
people grabbing whatever they could, loading up their cars and
racing out of town.

Lois Lane, grey haired editor and chief of the Daily Planet, emerged
from her office as she watched her reporters busily working away.
Unlike the rest of the city they had stayed, gathering information
and trying to stay on top of the story as it developed.

&quot;Hey boss,&quot; Cat Grant smiled as she held a phone to her ear, waiting
to get a statement from the mayor, &quot;any chance your inside source
with the cops can get us info?&quot;

Lois shook her head, &quot;Sorry, Maggie can&#39;t make a official comment
yet.&quot; Mentally she added, `And besides that, she really doesn&#39;t know
much.&#39;

&quot;Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve got so far,&quot; Kristin Wells said, the crime beat
reporter dropping off a sheaf of papers.

&quot;Military statement,&quot; Lois noted, &quot;Lexcorp statement, and it looks
like the Outsiders, Teen Titans and JSA have all mobilized too.&quot;

&quot;Just got a call from the Gotham office,&quot; Cat noted, &quot;seems Raven
has called up the Gotham City irregulars too.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Lois said briskly, &quot;we&#39;ll put together a early edition
based on this, as well as some man on the street interviews.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Kristin agreed.

&quot;So far, I only have one question to go,&quot; Lois mused.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Cat wondered as she assigned a photographer to go get some
shorts of the Metropolis Police Department gearing up.

&quot;Where&#39;s the Justice League during all this?&quot; Lois asked, also
mentally adding, `And where is Superman?&#39;

Within the depths of Warworld, the prison groaned as a figure in
tattered red and blue strained against his bonds. &quot;You&#39;re wasting
your time,&quot; Vril Dox sighed, the blonde haired and green skinned
Colulan leaning against the wall.

&quot;No,&quot; Superman shook his head, &quot;even with the kryptonite and red sun
lamps, I can&#39;t surrender.&quot;

A soft groan drew their attention to a figure laying in the corner,
then gradually Wonder Woman began to stir. She looked up, black hair
falling into her eyes as she blinked then murmured, &quot;Well that was
interesting.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Superman asked, eyes wide.

&quot;She&#39;s been in a coma for weeks,&quot; Vril rolled his eyes, &quot;how do you
think she us?&quot;

&quot;Shut up, Dox,&quot; Superman sighed.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I worried you, Kal,&quot; Wonder Woman said, &quot;I wasn&#39;t
expecting my out of body experience to last that long.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Superman asked.

Wonder Woman sat up a bit, &quot;After Maxima beat me unconscious I was
able to slip free from my physical body. In spirit form I took it
upon myself to investigate the Almeracian&#39;s and their plans.&quot;

Vril leaned forward as much as his bonds would allow, &quot;What did you
find out?&quot;

&quot;Almerac is lying to their allies, for one,&quot; Wonder Woman revealed.
She smiled grimly, &quot;Maxima may be telling her allies that she
intends to share power, but in reality she&#39;ll save a certain number
of their Elite for breeding purpses them slaughter the rest.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve got to stop them,&quot; Superman said flatly.

&quot;I have a question,&quot; Vril said. As they looked at him he asked, &quot;Is
that actually Maxima? I understood she died during the Imperitrex
invasion.&quot;

&quot;So did I,&quot; Superman conceded, &quot;but...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not Maxima,&quot; Wonder Woman agreed, &quot;though she believes she
is.&quot;

&quot;So what is she, then?&quot; Vril wondered.

&quot;When I touched her,&quot; Wonder Woman sighed as she told Superman, &quot;I
recognized her species, though I couldn&#39;t tell you at the time.
She&#39;s a Tormock, a alien race we encountered when I lead the Justice
League.&quot;

&quot;Tormocks?&quot; Superman blinked.

Vril rolled his eyes, &quot;Try to keep up.&quot; Taking a deep breath he
said, &quot;The Tormocks were a violent race in prehistory that fought
the Vuldarians, a race of peacekeepers. They stole powers from the
Vuldarians via genetic engineering as well as devestated planets
from one end of the universe to the other.

&quot;Like Maxima is doing now,&quot; Wonder Woman smiled grimly.

Superman nodded grimly, looking around their prison at the exhausted
men and women laying there. &quot;Are you up to a fight?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Always,&quot; Wonder Woman agreed.

Superman smiled back warmly. &quot;And you, Vril?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Do you have a plan?&quot; Vril wondered.

&quot;I thought we&#39;d bust out of here, grab some weapons for all of us
then we&#39;d fight our way off Warworld,&quot; Superman shrugged.

&quot;That is not a plan,&quot; Vril gritted his teeth, &quot;that&#39;s a suicide
attempt.&quot;

&quot;You have a suggestion?&quot; Wonder Woman asked mildly. In her
experience convoluted plans usually only worked for the gods...
mortals were better off sticking with simplicity.

&quot;I felt us drop out of warp a short time ago,&quot; Vril said
grimly, &quot;we&#39;ve arrived at a new Star System, quite possibly Earth&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Then we should...&quot; Superman started.

Cutting him off Vril continued, &quot;We should wait until they engage
human forces before we decide what to do.&quot; Unobtrusively he tapped
on his hand cuffs, using a code he was certain the Earther&#39;s would
recognize.

`Morse code,&#39; Superman recognized it nearly immediately.

Tapping away Vril said, &quot;We wait until the Earthers attack, then
make a break for it.&quot;

Wonder Woman nodded slightly as she responded, &quot;I agree, we need to
wait and see.&quot; Then she winked impishly.

&quot;Who seems to be the most fit of the captives?&quot; Superman asked Vril
via code, scanning the chamber thoughtfully.

&quot;Most are in pretty poor shape,&quot; Vril replied the same way, &quot;the
Almeracians are only providing the minimum food and water needed.&quot;
He paused, &quot;We&#39;ll only be able to save the strongest, you know.&quot;

&quot;No one get&#39;s left behind,&quot; Wonder Woman jumped in, her expression
intense as she tapped away.

&quot;I will never understand you Earthers,&quot; Vril said aloud, almost as
if to himself, &quot;Logic totally escapes you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not a matter of logic,&quot; Superman said tiredly.

Wonder Woman smiled as she added, &quot;It&#39;s about honor.&quot;

&quot;As I said,&quot; Vril growled, &quot;I will never understand you Earthers.&quot;

On the security deck a pair of Almeracians watched, the young women
frowning. &quot;Did you understand that, Eiko?&quot; one asked the other.

&quot;No, Fiko,&quot; the other frowned. &quot;Do you think we should pass a
recording of this to our superiors?&quot; she wondered.

Fiko paled. &quot;If it ends up being nothing, Princess Cylene will be
annoyed,&quot; she fretted.

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Eiko agreed. She smiled slightly, &quot;Besides, they&#39;re
weak and deprived captives. What could go wrong?&quot;

Fiko sighed softly, &quot;I really wish you hadn&#39;t said that. Now I&#39;m
nearly certain something will go wrong.&quot;</pre>
