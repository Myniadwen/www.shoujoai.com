<pre>~ I The start of a new school year ~

&#147;You understand me, don&#146;t you? It&#146;s like I&#146;ve been thinking a lot of 
her during this summer vacation&#133;&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s ok, Ron! I want you two together just as bad as you do! I&#146;ll 
help you, don&#146;t worry!&#148; Harry assured his best friend while they were 
on the 9 &frac34; Platform.

&#147;Hey, guys!&#148; Hermione jumped from behind their backs, making Ron 
cough.

Harry was surprised to see Hermione Granger&#133; so changed. She was 
almost as tall as the boys, but she wasn&#146;t that thin, she had round 
forms! And her chestnut tree-like color of her was fitting perfectly 
her dark green outfit.

Ron was staring at her open-mouthed.

Harry gave him a poke at the back, but too late, as Hermione noticed 
the red haired&#146;s look.

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; she asked.

&#147;Uhm, nothing&#133;&#148; Ron answered 

Hermione became a different person since the end of the fifth school 
year, the 2 boys thought: she was more attractive, and she wasn&#146;t the 
shy gal anymore, but seemed to have gained self-confidence.

&#147;So, where&#146;s Ginny?&#148; Hermione asked, looking around

&#147;Oh, she&#146;s meeting some of her colleagues!&#148; Harry answered.

&#147;Yeah, well I don&#146;t suppose she&#146;ll be spending as much time with us as 
in the precedent years&#133; being in the fifth year, I bet she even has a 
boyfriend!&#148; Hermione smiled

&#147;Could that be a hint to us 2 being &#133; ah, I&#146;m kidding myself&#133; she 
would never look at me as at a more than a friend!&#148; Ron was thinking.

&#147;Hi, guys&#133; Hermione!&#148; Ginny said as she hugged her best friend. Ginny 
wasn&#146;t at all like Hermione, she was slim and her long and straight 
red-hair contrasted her white skin. She wore an orange skirt and 
sweater. 

&#147;Ginny, what do you say about us going in the train and occupating a 
compartment, until these two young-men decide to join us?&#148; Hermione 
laughed, and even though she was making fun of the 2 boys, Ron loved 
to see her smile.

&#147;Great idea!&#148; Ginny also smiled. Harry laughed when Ron started:

&#147;Hey, watch it, scourt!&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m not a scourt! You are!&#148; Ginny defended herself.

&#147;Yeah? Who&#146;s older, eh? You or me?&#148; Ron asked, teasing her and 
although Harry tried to stop them, he continuing teasing her, until 
most of kids around the platform were watching the show.

&#147;Weasley, is this how you learnt to treat young ladies?&#148; a cool voice 
was heard from behind. 

&#147;Malfoy, this is NOT your business!&#148; Ron loosed his temper. &#147;I mean, 
who was this guy to butt in wherever he wanted?&#148;

&#147;It is my business, if a beautiful young lady like your sister is 
misjudged!&#148; Draco said making Ginny blush violently

&#147;Cut the crap, jerk!&#148;

&#147;Hey, who are calling a jerk, pink rat?&#148;

&#147;Is there another Malfoy?&#148; Ron suggested, although offended by the 
&#147;pink&#148; remark.

Hermione was watching the show, until she decided to interfere

&#147;C&#146;mon, boys and &#133;  (looking at Draco) whatever, I know you&#146;re happy 
that NOW, you can do whatever you want, without loosing any points 
from your house, but lemme tell you something: this is not the place 
nor the moment to make fools of yourselves, okay?&#148; Hermione stopped 
the two fighting boys (which became a box scene, since all the kids, 
starting with the first years, and ending with the seventh years were 
watching the show, and gambling!

&#147;Hey, babe, do you want to f*ck on the floor?&#148; a voice was heard from 
the audience. 

&#147;Up yours!&#148; Hermione said, surprising everyone including herself.

&#147;Oh, the chick is hot&#133;&#148;

&#147;She is NOT your chick, bastard!&#148; Ron started throwing fists around 
the crowd. 

&#147;C&#146;mon guys&#148;, Harry said as he gathered Ron, Hermione and Ginny and 
went to an empty compartment.

&#147;Great way of starting the school year, dudes!&#148; Dean and Neville were 
in front of the door, grinning.

&#147;Get lost!&#148; Ron said, who was very pissed off.

&#147;Ron&#133; Ronny!&#148; Hermione said as she got closer to Ron and put her arms 
against his neck. &#147;Don&#146;t get mad on those jerks&#133; do it for me!&#148; she 
continued looking in his brown eyes.

&#147;Uhm&#133; err, it&#146;s their fault, Herm&#133; you heard that guy who called you&#133; 
you&#133; a&#133;!&#148; 

&#147;So, what? You have to admit, I&#146;m a hot babe!&#148;

Harry could hardly keep himself from exploding in laughter.

&#147;Guys, I&#146;m bored!&#148;

&#147;Oh, you&#146;re bored? SCOURT!&#148; Ron smiled manically.

&#147;Ron, if you&#146;re going to start again, I&#146;m leaving!&#148; Ginny said

&#147;You don&#146;t see me objecting!&#148;

&#147;Hum, you&#133;!&#148; Ginny ended and left quickly the compartment

&#147;Ron, she&#146;s your sister!&#148; Harry said

&#147;Who cares? And plus, she got defended by that nerd, Malfoy!&#148;

&#147;Maybe he likes her&#148; Hermione suggested, getting up and preparing to 
leave the compartment.

&#147;Where are you going?&#148; Ron asked, forgetting that they still weren&#146;t 
lovers.

&#147;After your sister, of course! At least someone should protect her!&#148; 
she smiled and closed the door.

&#147;She&#146;s unbelievable!&#148; Ron stated. 

Harry just smiled.

------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;Ginny, are you in there?&#148; Hermione&#146;s voice was heard.

No one answered.

&#147;Ginny, I know you&#146;re in there!&#148; Hermione said softly and she opened 
the toilet door. There a red headed girl was sitting on the floor, 
with tears in her eyes.

&#147;Ginny, poor gal!&#148; Hermione said as she sat down close to her best 
friend and put her arms around Ginny waist. &#147;Why are you crying?&#148; she 
asked as she caressed the red hair.

&#147;You don&#146;t know&#133; you don&#146;t know how it&#146;s like having 6 older 
brothers... first, you&#146;re the youngest and get all the pranks and 
plus, you&#146;re a girl&#133; I&#146;m alone!&#148; Ginny cried on Hermione&#146;s shoulder

&#147;You&#146;re not alone&#133; you&#146;ve got me!&#148; Hermione said. 

Ginny lifted her head and looked in Hermione&#146;s brown eyes.

Hermione walked her finger on Ginny&#146;s white face. She touched her red 
lips and her pale cheeks. She slowly went down on her neck and lower. 

Ginny closed her eyes and bended over Hermione. A kiss was born. The 
red haired girl started smelling Hermione&#146;s face. Her eyes were 
touching Hermione&#146;s eyes, her nose was touching the other girl&#146;s nose&#133; 
her lips were biting each other.

&#147;Hermione&#133;&#148; she said before she kissed her again, this time longer and 
raging. 

Hermione opened her green shirt and took off Ginny&#146;s sweater. Ginny 
leaned on her back, pulling Hermione above her. Oh, her cinnamon 
incense&#133; her hot lips, her white and tempting skin&#133;

&#147;Ginny!!!&#148;

&#147;Hermione, hold me tight&#133; hold me&#133; tight&#133; oh, Hermione!&#148;

Ginny rubbed her hand on Hermione&#146;s empty back&#133; and down&#133; and lower, 
until she reached her skirt&#146;s zipper. She unzipped the skirt, and 
drove her hand lower, massaging her round ass.

Hermione got up and her unzipped skirt fell off, leaving her with just 
black underwear.

She helped Ginny get up and pressed her on the hard and cold wall. 
Moving her hand up and down on the girl&#146;s slim and naked body, 
Hermione was moaning with pleasure. She wanted to have her, to be one 
with her; she wanted to taste her flesh&#133; to lick her back.

&#147;Ginny&#133;&#148; Ginny was preoccupied licking her neck and biting her ears.

&#147;Herm&#133;&#148;
 
------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;Where could they be?&#148; Ron threw his magical cards on the floor and 
looked outside the window. &#147;Almost 2 hours past and Hermione still 
hasn&#146;t come!&#148;

&#147;Maybe they&#146;re talking&#133;&#148; Harry suggested

&#147;How much can two girls talk?&#148; Ron asked.

&#147;Well, if they have a good enough subject for gossiping&#133; my idea? Day 
and night!&#148;

&#147;What do you mean?&#148;

&quot;Well, it&#146;s obvious they&#146;re gossiping about you!&#148; Harry said as he 
&#145;magically&#146; gather all the cards in one thick pack.

&#147;You&#146;re scaring me, dude!&#148;

Harry smiled wickedly. &#147;Or, they might as well talk about Potions and 
Snape!&#148;

&#147;We really have to find them! Let&#146;s go!&#148; Ron said, turning off the 
lights and closing the door of the compartment just as Harry got out 
of it.

&#147;Hermione? Where have you been?&#148; Ron said as the 2 boys bumped into 
Hermione and Ginny.

&#147;Oh, hi! Where were you going?&#148; Ginny said, avoiding looking at Ron.

&#147;We were going after you, girls!&#148; Harry explained.

Ron entered back in the compartment, disappointed that he couldn&#146;t 
save Hermione, from anything!

Harry slowly asked Hermione if she fixed the problem. Hermione nodded.

After a few minutes, the train stopped in Hogsmeade, and all the 
students got off and went to the carriages, except the first years, 
which were directed by Hagrid to the lake.

Ron was so troubled that he didn&#146;t even notice when Draco made faces 
at him or when Hagrid greeted them with a scream.

But they soon entered the Great Hall, and all the worries were left 
behind!
