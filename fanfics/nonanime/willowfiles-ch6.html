<a href="../nonanime/willowfiles-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;Miss Rosenburg,&quot; the brown haired woman said
respectfully, pushing up her glasses a bit nervously,
&quot;welcome to Watcher&#39;s Roost.&quot;

&quot;Miss Chalmers,&quot; Willow nodded, her reddish brown hair
tied back by a piece of leather cord, her clothes a
bit battered looking from the trip to England. The
plane ride there had been bad enough, but the jeep
over the rough road had been murder.

She smiled slightly, &quot;Lydia, please.&quot;

&quot;Lydia,&quot; Willow smiled, &quot;and I&#39;m Willow.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Lydia said, &quot;it&#39;s a honor to meet you again,
ma&#39;am.&quot; She turned to the open castle gate, the ruin
towering above them, &quot;Would you care to follow me
inside?&quot;

&quot;Is it safe?&quot; Willow asked wryly.

&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; Lydia reassured her.

While the outside of the building was a wreck, the
interior was a much different manner. The walls
gleamed, the floors were shiny and the lights cast a
warm glow over a very modern looking facility. Men and
women in casual clothes raced to and fro, and guards
stood at intersections, armed with guns as well as
wooden stakes.

&quot;So this is the new headquarters of the Watchers,&quot;
Willow murmured.

&quot;With the destruction of the Council we felt it was
time for a change,&quot; Lydia agreed. &quot;This facility is
much more secure, and also offers much better
communication facilities to the Slayers all around the
world.&quot;

&quot;Assuming they&#39;re interested in working for you,&quot;
Willow noted.

&quot;True,&quot; Lydia admitted, &quot;:some don&#39;t, but I&#39;d like to
think we offer a service that Slayers could very much
need.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Willow&#39;s tone of voice changed, becoming
harder as she said, &quot;Now that the pleasantries are
done...&quot; She suddenly roared, &quot;Why in HELL did your
people kidnap me!&quot;

Lydia stepped back, even as the commotion in the large
room they entered ground to a stunned halt. &quot;It was
not a kidnaping,&quot; Lydia started...

&quot;When people draw guns on me,&quot; Willow snarled at her,
&quot;I think that certainly qualifies as a kidnaping!&quot;

Lydia looked at Willow in surprise, &quot;They did WHAT?!&quot;

&quot;Three men burst into my apartment in Seattle,&quot; Willow
explained to her coldly, &quot;through my defensive wards,
drew a gun on me then hit me with some kind of drug. I
woke up on the plane to England, and decided to wait
things out before raising hell.&quot;

&quot;I knew the special ops team had been sent,&quot; a new
voice said, &quot;but I never expected them to use such
tactics, Willow.&quot;

Willow turned, blinking in surprise as she recognized
the dusky skinned woman striding towards them.
&quot;Olivia?&quot;

Olivia, once Giles&#39; on again, off again girlfriend,
smiled at Willow as she took the girl&#39;s hand. &quot;They
were asked to contact you,&quot; she said wryly, &quot;obviously
they decided it was best to pull a snatch and grab,
instead.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Willow sighed. Putting her annoyance aside
once more Willow ran a hand through her hair tiredly
and asked, &quot;All right, what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;We needed your help in building better mystical
defenses for the Council,&quot; Olivia admitted, &quot;but I&#39;ll
let the head of the council explain. If you and Lydia
could follow me?&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Lydia said softly, &quot;do I really need to come
along?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been designated Willow&#39;s liason,&quot; Olivia
smiled as they set out, &quot;it&#39;s best you stay in the
loop at all times.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Lydia nodded as they went to a set of stone
stairs going up.

The tower of the ruined keep had clearly been rebuilt
and reinforced over the years, and the steps modified
to be easy on the feet. They soon reached a modern
looking door which Olivia rapped on, &quot;Sir, she&#39;s
here.&quot;

&quot;Come in,&quot; the man answered.

The upper office was decorated in what could almost be
described as an old English style, with comfy chairs,
a fireplace and all. The man within fit the image,
too, with steel grey hair, a grand-fatherly face and a
pipe smoking beside his seat.

&quot;Sherlock Holmes, I presume?&quot; Willow joked.

&quot;Alexandar Tomassi,&quot; he corrected, &quot;acting head of the
Watcher&#39;s Council.&quot;

&quot;Acting?&quot; Willow raised an eyebrow questioningly.

&quot;Ideally,&quot; Alexandar said honestly, &quot;we&#39;d like to talk
Rupert Giles into taking the role, but he&#39;s been quite
stubborn about it.&quot;

&quot;Sir,&quot; Olivia gave him a pointed look.

&quot;Ahem,&quot; Alexandar cleared his throat. &quot;I&#39;m glad you
arrived, Miss Rosenberg,&quot; he admitted, &quot;while we have
several competant magicians on our payroll, few match
your abilities and experience.&quot;

Willow saw Olivia giving her a worried look, probably
silently praying Willow wasn&#39;t going to reveal the
accidental kidnaping. &quot;I&#39;ll be glad to help sir,&quot;
Willow promised.

&quot;Good, good,&quot; Alexandar agreed. He looked over at
Lydia, &quot;Could you escort Miss Rosenberg to her
quarters? I&#39;m sure she&#39;s exhausted by her flight.&quot;

&quot;Of course sir,&quot; Lydia agreed quickly and they left
Olivia and the older man to their work.

Willow followed Lydia down stairs, her thoughts
rapidly moving. &quot;I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve been hit once
already?&quot; she asked as they returned to the busy main
hall.

&quot;Twice,&quot; Lydia admitted as they moved past the
enterance hall then over to another corridor, &quot;a
doppelganger snuck in, and a curse hit a staff
member.&quot;

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Willow winced slightly, &quot;was he or she all
right?&quot;

&quot;It was more embarassing to him than anything else,&quot;
Lydia smiled wryly as they turned a corner and passed
into another structure, &quot;but we think it was a
warning.&quot;

&quot;Which is why I&#39;m here,&quot; Willow guessed.

Lydia lead her into what looked like a dormatory,
doors lining the hall. &quot;We hope,&quot; Lydia agreed as she
unlocked a door. &quot;Guest quarters are here.&quot; she waved
Willow towards a comfortably set up room, &quot;we&#39;ll
deliver dinner whenever you&#39;ll need it.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Willow said, tiredness rushing back.

&quot;Willow?&quot; Lydia said quietly. She smiled as Willow
turned to face her, &quot;Thank you for not mentioning the
kidnaping thing to our superior.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t do it to be kind,&quot; Willow shrugged, &quot;the way
I see it you owe me a favor.&quot; And with that Willow
firmly pulled the door shut behind her.

Lydia walked back to her work, thinking, &#39;She&#39;s not
quite what I was expecting.&#39;

Several years ago, Lydia had met Willow Rosenberg and
friends in the midst of the Glory crisis, when the
Watchers had been dealing with difficulties with
Buffy, too. Willow had, despite magical powers, seemed
quiet, mousy and almost innocent to Lydia at the time.
Now, however, she nearly radiated strength and
confidence, as well as a subtle sexuality.

&#39;To be honest,&#39; Lydia admitted, &#39;I think I fancy her.&#39;

Olivia was just returning to the main command center
as Lydia entered, so the young woman hurried to her
side. &quot;I want the special ops team on the satelite
link,&quot; Olivia said flatly, &quot;I want to know if Willow&#39;s
story checks out.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t believe her?&quot; Lydia looked surprised.

&quot;I think she told the truth,&quot; Olivia sighed, &quot;it&#39;d be
far too easy to be caught in a lie. I just want proof
so I can punish the ops team.&quot;

Lydia smiled, &quot;Oh, right.&quot;

Olivia bit her lip, &quot;I can&#39;t get over how much Willow
has changed since I last saw her...&quot;

&quot;You, too?&quot; Lydia asked.

&quot;She&#39;s much more dangerous, I think,&quot; Olivia mused. A
smile tugged at her lips, &quot;She reminds me of Ripper,
actually.&quot;

&quot;Mr Giles?&quot; Lydia blinked.

&quot;Not in any obvious way,&quot; Olivia admitted, &quot;but they
both have that same sort of aura now.&quot; A pause, &quot;It&#39;s
kind of sexy.&quot;</pre>
