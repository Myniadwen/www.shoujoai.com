<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 20 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/supergirl-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>The alarm rang through the Watchtower, Oracle&#39;s voice ringing out as she 
reported, &quot;There has been a breakout at the Fortress, repeat, there has 
been a breakout at the Fortress.&quot;

The members of the Justice League began to gather in the meeting room in 
seconds, lead by a red and gold streak. &quot;I thought that it was escape 
proof?&quot; Flash asked, the slim young woman frowning as she moved 
restlessly.

&quot;There is no such thing as escape proof,&quot; Martian Manhunter replied 
dryly, the green skinned figure slipping through the floor to enter the 
chamber.

&quot;If you&#39;re someone like Mister Miracle maybe,&quot; Supergirl strode in, red 
hair flowing around her head, &quot;but I thought that all of the dampers 
built into the Fortress were supposed to keep the criminals there under 
control.&quot;

Steel and Kestrel strode in together as they both pulled on their 
uniforms. &quot;You&#39;re timing stinks,&quot; Steel muttered, her long blue hair 
flowing down her back.

Kestrel scowled as she pulled her purple gloves on, &quot;So who else is up 
here?&quot;

D-ko entered after them, the little blonde still dressed in her maid&#39;s 
uniform. &quot;Firestorm is attending to personal business,&quot; she noted, &quot;but 
Green Lantern should be here.&quot;

There was a flash of green from an outside window and Green Lantern 
appeared, the young woman settling down beside them. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said 
sheepishly, &quot;I was just doing some exterior maintenance on the &#39;Tower.&quot;

&quot;So what are we dealing with?&quot; Supergirl asked.

In the middle of the meeting room&#39;s table appeared the holographic image 
of a young woman sitting in a wheelchair. &quot;Eyewitness reports are 
sketchy,&quot; she said seriously, &quot;but it appears that the Fortress has been 
destroyed by an unknown power.&quot;

There was a moment of shocked silence. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious,&quot; Flash 
managed.

Supergirl closed her eyes for a moment then she took on a determined 
expression. &quot;Use the old JLA membership cards and signaling devices,&quot; 
she opened her eyes and ordered crisply, &quot;we need to get anyone 
available mobilized. There are hundreds of criminals that were in there, 
far too many for us to try and contain alone.&quot;

Oracle&#39;s hologram flickered slightly as she went to work, diverting 
processing power to other functions. &quot;Should I inform the non-aligned 
teams like the Outsiders?&quot; she asked as the team moved to the 
teleporters.

&quot;Pass the information on,&quot; Kestrel offered, &quot;if they act on it is their 
choice.&quot; With that the team entered the chambers, there was a flare of 
light and they were gone.

In the American midwest, near a small country town a group of 
supervillains gazed around in fear and confusion. The animals circled 
the group, domestic pets, farm animals and wild creatures growled 
dangerously, pinning them down.

&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; Calendar Man blurted, the number printed cape 
swirling around him.

&quot;You picked the wrong town to hit,&quot; the blonde haired man commented. He 
leaned up against the tree chewing an apple, his hair mostly gray, a 
ragged beard covering his chin.

&quot;And who are you?&quot; Sportsmaster asked, using her golf club to fend off a 
cat.

&quot;My name is Buddy Baker,&quot; he shrugged casually, &quot;but I used to be called 
Animal Man.&quot; Under his breath he added, &quot;I knew I should have gotten rid 
of my old JL Europe ID card.&quot;

Up in the Watchtower Oracle smiled to herself. &#39;I never expected so many 
to respond, honestly.&#39; She frowned slightly, calling up information. The 
Outsiders were handling crisises in Opal City, a rough assemblage of 
Titans were dealing with New York, but there were still major trouble 
spots.

BOOM!

The sonic boom rattled people&#39;s teeth as Supergirl raced across the 
country, her teeth grit with determination. &quot;They&#39;re attacking where in 
Metropolis?&quot; she demanded.

Maggie Sawyer&#39;s voice was related by Oracle, &quot;Lexcorp corporate 
headquarters, there&#39;s a large group of costumed criminals of all sorts, 
led by the General.&quot;

&quot;The General?&quot; Supergirl repeated.

Oracle&#39;s voice came on-line with the information, &quot;The General was an 
adversary of Batman&#39;s years ago, a tactical genius in his preteens. He 
opposed both Robin and other heroes before apparently going straight. In 
reality he moved into corporate crime but was busted a few years ago.&quot;

&quot;Entering Metropolis,&quot; Supergirl swept by the Daily Planet globe, 
&quot;signing off.&quot;

The Lexcorp Tower had smoke billowing up on the lower levels, someone 
having done serious damage to the exterior security systems. The black 
haired man directed the others, his replica military uniform marking him 
as the General.

&quot;I&#39;ve taken out the exterior cannons,&quot; the armored man said with a 
sneer, massive cannons mounted on each arm.

&quot;Well done Barrage,&quot; General answered. He looked up, &quot;Did Killer Moth 
survive his encounter with the lasers?&quot;

&quot;Cut him to ribbons,&quot; the girl in a bathing suit and goggles shrugged, 
&quot;but you can count on Phantom Lady. My black light powers have blinded 
the security systems on the lower levels.&quot;

Supergirl dropped down in front of them, deciding that being sneaky was 
going to be a waste of time. &quot;You know who I am,&quot; she said to them 
crisply, &quot;you know what I can do, so why not just surrender now?&quot;

&quot;Metallo?&quot; General snapped his fingers.

&quot;Woah!&quot; Supergirl cried as metal cables exploded from the ground to wrap 
around her, glowing with deadly green kryptonite radiation.

&quot;I took your daddy on,&quot; the robotic figure emerged from the ground, his 
body bulky, trying to look muscular somehow, &quot;you&#39;re small change, kid.&quot;

Supergirl bit back nausea and pain, drawing on her amazon heritage for 
strength. With a groan she tore from the cables, turning around quickly 
to pick the cyborg up with one hand. She grabbed the startled figure by 
the head and tore it free.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Metallo squealed as she hurled the head one way and the body 
another.

&quot;Next,&quot; Supergirl looked at the General, the man&#39;s own expression 
calculating.

&quot;No,&quot; the General held up his hand to stop Barrage and Phantom Lady from 
acting, &quot;I was counting on you still being preoccupied by all the other 
Fortress escapees. Tactically it makes no sense to carry on fighting.&quot;

The battle field was encased in pure darkness, one that even Supergirl&#39;s 
eyes couldn&#39;t pierce. Just a moment later it completely dissipated, the 
General and Phantom Lady both gone and a startled Barrage left standing 
there.

&quot;That son of a b...&quot; Barrage cursed and kept on cursing when the 
Metropolis PD eventually came by to pick him up.

&#39;Star Labs in Pittsburgh is under attack,&#39; Oracle calmly noted, &#39;but 
thankfully we already have someone on scene.&#39; She smiled slightly, &#39;More 
than one someone, in fact.&#39;

The Ray cut across the battlefield, his body merely a black shadow 
within his powerful golden energy field. He lashed out with energy bolts 
and solid light constructs, struggling valiantly to keep his purple 
skinned enemy at bay as he called, &quot;Firestorm, you all right? I can&#39;t 
hold the Parasite back for much longer.&quot;

&quot;Just need to catch my breath,&quot; the flaming haired hero called back. 
Firestorm leaned on a brown haired woman who looked at him in concern.

&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re all right?&quot; Louise Lincon asked softly.

&quot;I&#39;ll live,&quot; Firestorm smiled wryly. He pushed himself to stand up 
straight, &quot;We&#39;ve got to make Parasite burn up his energy before he tries 
something really destructive.&quot;

&quot;I love this power,&quot; the Parasite laughed as the misshapen man lashed 
out with the powers he had stolen from firestorm, transforming the road 
into liquid tar and engulfing running spectators.

&quot;No!&quot; Louise ran forward, the temperature dropping all around her. Her 
clothes shattered, then her skin went snow white as she transformed, 
sealing the startled Parasite in ice.

&quot;Killer Frost?&quot; Ray gaped at her in shock.

&quot;Just Frost,&quot; she answered as Parasite broke free violently.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Parasite looked at her in surprise, &quot;I thought we were on the 
same side?&quot;

&quot;Not any more,&quot; Frost engulfed him in ice as she yelled to Firestorm, 
&quot;Now!&quot;

Ice shifted to iron under Firestorm&#39;s blast but Parasite broke free. 
Again and again they entombed him, until finally the powers that he had 
absorbed faded enough that he couldn&#39;t break free.

In the aftermath Frost shifted to human form even as sirens wailed in 
the distance. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind,&quot; Louise pulled a Firestorm created 
garment on, &quot;I&#39;d rather not stick around for the police.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ray waved as she left.</pre>
