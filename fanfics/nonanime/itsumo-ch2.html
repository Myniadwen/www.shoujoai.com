<h1>Itsumo Means Forever (part 2 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/itsumo-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Author&#39;s Note: Well, it looks like I guessed wrong. Part two onwards was 
my best guess as to what was going to happen to Buffy and friends at the 
end of the series, all written well before the final episode came out. 
As I don&#39;t want to have to re-write my whole story, here is the &#39;Itsumo&#39; 
version of what happened in the final episode of Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer.

        Sitting in the Principal&#39;s office, Willow chanted softly, 
looking down at the Slayers weapon that was laying there before her. The 
words seemed to flow out on their own, until with a final phrase the axe 
flared to life.

        &quot;Oh.. my.. Goddess,&quot; Willow gasped out softly, her eyes wide.

        The power channeled through her and out, reaching each and every 
corner of the world, and for just a moment she felt that great power 
within her. And all around the world, the potential Slayers awoke to 
their own power.

        &quot;You&#39;re a goddess,&quot; Kennedy murmured, looking at Willow in awe.

        Willow smiled back at her weakly, &quot;And you&#39;re a Slayer.&quot; She 
felt as limp as a wet noodle, all the strength just rushing out of her, 
but she managed to pass the axe to Kennedy and say, &quot;You&#39;d better get 
this to them.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; and Kennedy was off like a shot, carrying the axe 
firmly.

        Willow sat there cross-legged for a few moments, then she simply 
fell sideways. &quot;That was neat,&quot; she murmured before just passing out.

        In the caverns of the Hellmouth, the tide was beginning to turn 
against the heroes.

        Things had gone pretty well, at first. The uber-vamps hadn&#39;t 
been expecting to face an small army of Slayers, and once Kennedy passed 
the Slayers&#39; axe to Buffy, the vamps fell easily. But there was an army 
of the ancient vampires, and the Slayers were young, untested. And then 
Buffy was stabbed from behind.

        &quot;B!&quot; Faith cried out, running to Buffy&#39;s side.

        &quot;Take this,&quot; Buffy handed her the axe, fixing Faith with an 
intense gaze, &quot;lead them, for me.&quot;

        &quot;I...&quot; Faith met her gaze steadily for a moment, many things 
passing between them, all unsaid. &quot;They won&#39;t know what hit &#39;em,&quot; Faith 
vowed, taking up the weapon.

        &quot;Would you bloody well work,&quot; Spike cursed, grabbing the amulet 
he wore and shaking it angrily. Light flared from between his fingers, a 
beam cutting across the darkness of the cavern to shine on where Buffy 
lay.

        The Slayer&#39;s eyes popped open wide, then slowly, painfully, 
Buffy pulled herself to her feet. Blood running down her side she limped 
over to Spike&#39;s side, reaching out to take his hand. Light danced around 
their fingers, and Buffy sighed softly, &quot;I understand.&quot;

        &quot;NO flippin&#39; way,&quot; Spike started to say, when Buffy put her 
finger to his lips.

        &quot;It&#39;s not your call to make,&quot; she said to him softly. Light and 
energy danced all around them, growing, but then it leveled off, 
somehow.

        &quot;We&#39;re not enough,&quot; Spike frowned.

        A light shot out from the amulet right up through the cavern 
roof. Laying in the hallway the blonde haired woman&#39;s body blazed, and a 
ghostly form rose up from it, looking about in confusion. She gracefully 
dropped down through the cavern ceiling, a spirit made up of glimmering 
light, her face both purely human and yet slightly demonic.

        &quot;Anya,&quot; Buffy whispered softly.

        Anya reached out a glittering, almost transparent hand and 
grasped at Spike&#39;s, seemingly becoming much more solid as she did so.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Spike started to say, when Anya cut him off.

        &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore,&quot; Anya said intensely, &quot;Let&#39;s just 
stop this thing, before it tries to hurt Xander again.&quot;

        The three shared a serious glance, then they all nodded at once. 
Buffy finished off the circuit, grasping Anya&#39;s hand firmly in hers, and 
the three of them suddenly exploded in a wash of purest mystical fire. 
The power passed over the other Slayers quite harmlessly, but the 
uber-vamps screamed and died as it struck them.

        &quot;Buffy!&quot; Faith cried out, even as she began to work at getting 
all the other Slayers out of the violently shaking cavern.

        &quot;Go,&quot; Buffy cried, &quot;we&#39;ve got to see this through to the end!&quot;

        The First Evil materialized inside the triangle that the three 
of them had made, her expression one of shock and disbelief. &quot;NO,&quot; the 
false Buffy cried out, &quot;you can&#39;t do this. This was meant to be my 
place, my time!&quot;

        &quot;Just watch us,&quot; Spike growled, his body glowing from within. 
All three of them shown brighter and brighter, while the First cried out 
in their grasp.

        Faith pushed the younger Slayers in front of her as they all ran 
up the stone stairs, quickly running into Giles, Andrew and the others 
who were coming towards the source of the noise and violence. &#39;Most run 
away from this stuff, not towards it,&#39; was the thought running through 
Faith&#39;s head, &#39;our lives are not like other peoples.&#39;

        &quot;Buffy?&quot; Giles asked, his eyes wide.

        Faith, her eyes dark with grief, simply shook her head no.

        &quot;Buffy!&quot; Dawn cried out tearfully, but Xander quickly grabbed at 
her, keeping her from running on towards where the seal was.

        Willow jerked, and Kennedy reached out a steadying hand to grasp 
her shoulder. &quot;What are they doing...&quot; Willow murmured, then her eyes 
widened. &quot;We&#39;ve got to get out of the school,&quot; she said intensely, &quot;and 
as far away as we can, right now!&quot;

        &quot;But why?&quot; Kennedy blinked.

        Giles, having shared a few different kinds of crisis with Willow 
over the years, didn&#39;t ask questions. &quot;Lets go,&quot; he quickly began to 
usher the others outside.

        &quot;The school bus,&quot; Principal Wood barked, &quot;get everyone into the 
school bus!&quot; and Giles, the Slayers, Xander, and the others began to 
pile inside. Thankfully the engines started up on the first try, and 
they were off.

        They only had to go for a few blocks when Willow relaxed a bit 
in her seat. She said softly, &quot;That should be far enough, I think.&quot;

        Faith looked back, and her eyes widened. The entire school 
seemed to simply fold inward, imploding, then the sink hole began to 
spread outward. &quot;Maybe we should start it up again?&quot; she asked, grabbing 
at the wheel.

        The collapse began to slow, then gradually came to a stop, only 
swallowing up the houses and buildings that were closest to the high 
school itself. Giles looked over at Willow and softly asked her, &quot;What 
happened down there?&quot;

        &quot;Buffy, Spike, and Anya formed a new seal for the Hellmouth, a 
stronger seal than ever before,&quot; Willow murmured softly.

        &quot;And the First?&quot; Faith asked.

        With a grim little smile Willow said, &quot;It&#39;s trapped in the seal 
itself.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Kennedy blinked.

        &quot;The three of them have become a living prison for the First,&quot; 
Willow said softly, &quot;trapping it away from the world forever.&quot;

        &quot;As long as no one messes with the seal,&quot; Faith said 
thoughtfully. She smiled sadly over at Giles and Dawn, &quot;I think I&#39;ll be 
sticking around, help keep an eye on things.&quot;

        Tears glittered on Dawn&#39;s cheeks as she looked towards the 
sinkhole, but her voice was steady as she said, &quot;I think Buffy&#39;d like 
that.&quot;

        Kennedy took Willow&#39;s hand gently in hers and softly asked her, 
&quot;Do you plan on sticking around here, too?&quot;

        Willow opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again. She 
thought of the power she had wielded in using the Slayers&#39; weapon, the 
sense of purpose that she had felt then. A purpose that seemed so much 
greater than any she had considered for herself before.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; even Willow was faintly surprised by her answer.
