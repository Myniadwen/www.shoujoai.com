<a href="../nonanime/supergirl-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>They swarmed up from beneath the city, misshapen,
almost mindless creatures consumed by rage and pain,
seeking nothing but destruction. They raced forward in
the dozens, in multiple colors and forms, but all of
them were powerful and clearly furious.

&quot;I thought Metropolis was more Supergirl&#39;s territory,&quot;
Kestrel remarked, the black and purple clad heroine
using a karate style strike to drop one of the
creatures then pulled a capsule from her belt.
Exploding in the middle of an upcoming group the
tear-gas overwhelmed the creatures, sending them
staggering around blindly.

B-ko used her wrist launcher to blast another group
back into the abandoned tunnels they had emerged from.
&quot;Well, we were in the area,&quot; Steel said crisply. A
laser bolt came from the other side of them and the
blue haired girl smiled as she said hesitantly, &quot;Thank
you, mom.&quot;

Lena Luthor nodded with a slight smile, hefting an
impressive looking laser weapon in her arms. They were
still adapting to their new relationship, though they
were slowly becoming a bit more relaxed together. &quot;I
just wish I knew where these things were coming from,
they&#39;re stretching out Lexcorp security and the
Metropolis PD to their limits,&quot; the redhead said
grimly, sighting and firing again to blast another few
of them backwards.

&quot;Oracle?&quot; Kestrel asked curiously.

&quot;They look like D. N. Aliens,&quot; Oracle answered as she
used projectors mounted on the Steel armor to generate
a hologram of her usual mask icon, &quot;created by the
Cadmus project in the late twentieth and early
twenty-first century.&quot;

&quot;Wait just a minute,&quot; a frowning Lena quickly
protested, &quot;wasn&#39;t Cadmus shut down by the government
years ago?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m remembering something,&quot; Kestrel frowned as
she asked, &quot;didn&#39;t the D. N. Aliens manage to break
out, somehow?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Oracle reported crisply, &quot;the scientists
were evacuated and the facility sealed up. but
obviously they figured out how to break out.&quot; She
paused, &quot;Mecha and the Martian Manhunter are
attempting to break in the other side of the tunnels.&quot;

&quot;So do we try to reseal them up,&quot; Steel wondered
aloud, &quot;or try to enter Cadmus itself and deal with
the source?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m leaning towards sealing them up,&quot; Kestrel
admitted, &quot;otherwise we&#39;re going to have to kill a lot
of these D. N. Aliens.&quot;

There was a tingle at the back of their minds, a
telepathic communication coming in from the Martian
Manhunter. &quot;I&#39;ve detected a force guiding the attack,&quot;
J&#39;onn reported, &quot;they are being driven forward by
something deeper inside the complex.&quot;

&quot;There goes that idea,&quot; Kestrel said wryly, &quot;looks
like we&#39;re going in.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Steel nodded, &quot;you and I will go in here,
try and drive past the D. N. Aliens and meet J&#39;onn and
Mecha in the center.&quot; She turned to Lena, &quot;Please stay
here and hold them back from the city with the police
and your security.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going with you,&quot; Lena said crisply.

&quot;You can&#39;t...&quot; Steel started only to freeze.

Lena activated a slim metal wristband and was enfolded
by a golden light. When it faded a suit of battle
armor enfolded her from head to toe, silver mesh and
heavy metal gauntlets in a very familiar looking
design. A clear helm revealed her impish smile as she
said, &quot;Why not? I&#39;ve even dressed up for the
occasion.&quot;

&quot;I can see where you get your design sense,&quot; Kestrel
murmured.

&quot;Thanks a lot, love,&quot; Steel sighed. She looked at her
mother thoughtfully, &quot;We won&#39;t be able to protect you
down there, you know.&quot;

Lena hefted the laser cannon much easier as she
answered, &quot;I can take care of myself, thanks.&quot; Much
more gently she continued, &quot;Let me help, please.&quot;

Steel studied her a moment then nodded. &quot;We could use
the help with Supergirl and the others busy,&quot; she
admitted. They turned to the tunnels together,
watching the creatures milling out in the darkness as
she asked, &quot;Ready?&quot;

Kestrel took a wing shaped throwing weapon out from
her belt, snapping it open with a smooth gesture,
&quot;Always.&quot;

Lena snapped the safety off her cannon, &quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Steel cried as she fired off a flight
of missiles into the monsters then the three of them
charged forward.

A ghostly figure dropped through the roof of another
section of the complex, dropping into an nearly empty
chamber. The green skinned Martian solidified as he
looked around, his golden eyes narrowed as he used his
telepathy to probe outward.

Boom! The door into the chamber exploded inward as a
metallic figure walked over the rubble, looking around
her curiously. &quot;Are you picking up anything?&quot; Mecha
asked, the robot girl looking more dangerous than
usual with her arm cannons and shoulder mounts popped
up.

J&#39;onn nodded grimly, &quot;Not far ahead, thankfully. And
it seems that whomever it was drove most of the D. N.
Aliens away, so the way seems clear.&quot;

&quot;Oracle has heard back from Firestorm on a coded
frequency,&quot; Mecha reported as they headed down a long
metal corridor, &quot;he&#39;s coming back to the Watchtower
from investigating the old Injustice Society
satellite.&quot;

&quot;Empty, of course,&quot; J&#39;onn noted. He looked grim,
&quot;We&#39;ve been running around putting out small fires,
but there&#39;s someone pulling the strings behind it
all.&quot;

&quot;The same ones behind the Fortress breakout, maybe?&quot;
Mecha speculated, connecting to a computer port in the
wall to open up the next door.

&quot;I&#39;ve passed the information on to a certain
associate,&quot; J&#39;onn said, thinking of Bruce Wayne with a
smile, &quot;I&#39;m hoping he&#39;ll be able to offer some
theories.&quot;

Mecha tilted her head as they neared a heavier set of
metal doors. Plugging into the wall she murmured, &quot;I&#39;m
picking up vibrations ahead, movement.&quot;

J&#39;onn winced visibly in pain, &quot;The telepathic
broadcast is strengthening, too. Looks like we&#39;ve
reached the source of the trouble.&quot;

&quot;Incoming,&quot; Mecha smiled suddenly.

There was a distant rumble, then a sharp detonation as
the wall collapsed inward and three figures moved into
their line of sight. Kestrel, Steel and Lena were all
dusty and a little the worse for wear but otherwise
they looked to be all right.

&quot;Oh sure,&quot; Steel said to the two dryly, &quot;you took the
easy way in.&quot;

&quot;Nice to see you made it here all right, ma&#39;am,&quot; Mecha
smiled happily.

&quot;Your friend Oracle sent us the plans of the
facility,&quot; Lena noted the wary glance the Manhunter
gave her but ignored it as she said, &quot;the command
center is just beyond this door.&quot;

&quot;Mecha opens the doors and goes in first,&quot; Kestrel
said crisply, &quot;the rest of us follow her in, keeping
an eye on each other as we go.&quot;

&quot;Why Mecha first?&quot; Steel had to ask.

&quot;If it is a telepath we&#39;re dealing with,&quot; Mecha nodded
thoughtfully, &quot;as a robot I should be immune to his
influence.&quot;

&quot;Kestrel,&quot; J&#39;onn nodded as Mecha cracked the security
and opened the doors.

The command center they raced into was badly in
disrepair, conduits and cables broke and dangling,
viewscreens cracked. The only light came from the
wretched figure sitting in the center of the room,
advanced life support equipment helping to support his
hideously oversized head. He didn&#39;t even speak
telepathically, they only felt a wave of agony wash
over them!

&quot;Hector Hammond!&quot; J&#39;onn blinked in surprise, trying to
use his own telepathy to shield their minds from the
man&#39;s projected agony. His eyes narrowed as he studied
the devices attached to the chair, &quot;It&#39;s torturing
him, somehow.&quot;

Mecha, Lena and Steel didn&#39;t wait for an order, they
quickly raced forward, opening up panels and studying
the technology filled chair. &quot;Psionic shields in your
armor?&quot; Lena asked, gritting her teeth as another wave
of pain hit them.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Steel sounded a bit strained, &quot;but they&#39;re not
working as well as I hoped.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Mecha asked as she passed needed
tools over.

&quot;For now,&quot; Steel sighed. She pointed to a module that
they had just uncovered and said, &quot;I think this is
it.&quot;

&quot;Delivering electric shocks every few seconds,&quot; Lena
agreed grimly, &quot;I&#39;ll remove it, you bypass systems
around it just in case.&quot; Working as a team they had
the device out in moments, the waves of pain stopping
as soon as they finished.

&quot;Torturing a man just to send an army of D. N. Aliens
against Metropolis,&quot; Kestrel frowned. &quot;who would do
that? And why?&quot;

&quot;Just a calling card,&quot; Hector rasped out, the badly
misshapen man&#39;s voice raspy from screaming, &quot;they
wanted you to know they were back.&quot; A weak breath and
he finished, &quot;They call themselves the Injustice
League.&quot;</pre>
