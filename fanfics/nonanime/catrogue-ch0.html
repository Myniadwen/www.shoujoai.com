<h1>The Adventures of Shadowcat and Rogue! (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The Alley was a massive tunnel buried far beneath Manhattan, created 
during the cold war terror as a refuge for humanity. Instead it was 
abandoned, until it was discovered and used by the outcasts of our 
society. Now, it was choked with smoke, and filled with the anguished 
cries of the many wounded and the dying. The Morlocks, a small band of 
outcast mutants, had lived here in peace until just a few hours ago.

Then, the assassins known only as the Marauders came. A group of 
ruthless killers, they had slain the men, women and innocent children 
of the Morlocks without any hesitation or signs of mercy. Until the 
X-men arrived to try and stop them.

Shadowcat frowned to herself, pushing her long brown hair out of her 
eyes. Her dark blue costume helped conceal her in the corner shadows, 
giving her a much-needed moment to catch her breath. Things were not 
going well for the X-Men, not well at all. These guys were very, very 
good, and her friends were just barely managing to hold their own. She 
saw Rogue stagger, falling to her knees, from what she couldn&#39;t see.

The Marauder who called himself Harpoon saw his chance, raising his 
namesake weapon to toss at her. Once it left his hands it would become 
a bolt of pure energy, &#39;Enough energy to kill the X-man, surely.&#39; he 
thought to himself with a sinister smile. He drew his arm back, and 
threw it with all the force he could muster.

Kitty saw it coming and did the only thing she could think of to do. 
She grabbed Rogue from behind, phasing them both in the desperate hope 
that the energy bolt would pass right through them both harmlessly. It 
didn&#39;t.

Kitty&#39;s scream of pain echoed off the walls of the Alley, chilling the 
hearts of all the X-Men who were present.

A few days later, Rogue leaned against the life support capsule that 
Kitty floated in, her black bodysuit stained and dirty, the outfit she 
wore over it just tossed on hurriedly. She reached up, wiping at her 
eyes as secretively as possible. She hoped no one had see her crying, 
she didn&#39;t want to loose the tough girl reputation she had earned. &#39;I 
let my guard down,&#39; she thought to herself fiercely, &#39;and she paid the 
price.&#39;

At first, it had just seemed that the energy bolt only trapped Kitty 
in her phased state, but that was only the beginning. She was growing 
more and more out of phase, to the point where her body would 
eventually loose it&#39;s ability to hold itself together. She would die 
as her component atoms scattered to the four winds.

&quot;Why, Pryde?&quot; Rogue whispered softly. &quot;Why did you go and do that for 
someone you still just barely know?&quot; she finished. She remembered how 
rough her arrival to the X-men had been, with Kitty one of the few 
neutral members. She waited to see what Rogue would do, which to the 
desperate young woman had felt like a gift from the gods.

She turned her head and started in surprise. Kitty was kneeling down 
in the capsule so that she was crouched down right there beside her. 
Kitty smiled gently at Rogue, and her mouth formed the words 
carefully, exaggerating them so Rogue might understand. &#39;I&#39;m just glad 
Mystique taught me to lip read,&#39; a teary eyed Rogue thought to 
herself.

&quot;You&#39;re my friend,&quot; the nearly silent Kitty said to Rogue simply.



Rogue smiled a bit as she remembered that moment, a hale and healthy 
Kitty Pryde walking by her side down this crowded street in Germany. 
Kitty had eventually been cured by the unlikely alliance of Dr. Doom 
and Reed Richards, but her long period of recovery had separated her 
from Rogue&#39;s team of X-men. It was only in the last few months that 
they had both actually been on the same X-team, together again.

They were in this unlikely place because of a urgent message from 
Mystique that she was in some kind of trouble. Rogue and Nightcrawler 
felt an obligation to go, as she was, in a way, both of their mothers. 
But Rogue felt a great deal of relief having Kitty along with them as 
well. A feeling she didn&#39;t let herself examine too closely.

&quot;Thanks for taking me with you,&quot; Kitty said with a cheery smile. 
&quot;Visiting foreign lands, seeing the tourist spots, and the opportunity 
to get away from the weirdness back at the mansion for awhile is 
great.&quot;

&quot;Not a problem, Pryde. I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re willing to help me and 
Kurt deal with our little family problem,&quot; Rogue answered her 
honestly. &#39;And it&#39;s always nice to be with you,&#39; she added to herself 
silently.

&quot;It may not be so little,&quot; Kitty cautioned her with a shrug. She then 
looked towards Rogue thoughtfully, &quot;I know this is really personal for 
you and Kurt. I was wondering why you agreed to let me come along?&quot;

Rogue looked a bit surprised at that, a bit at a loss for words. 
Finally, she unconsciously echoed the words Kitty had used with her so 
long ago, &quot;Because you&#39;re my friend.&quot; But somehow, those words didn&#39;t 
seem to be quite enough...
