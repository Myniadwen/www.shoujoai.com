<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>        &#39;Jean,&#39; Ororo left the living room to stand in the quiet 
hallway, focusing her concentration to reach the telepath half a world 
away. Oddly, there wasn&#39;t any immediate answer. &#39;JEAN!&#39; the african 
woman sent her thought out a bit more forcefully.

        There was an odd, almost disjointed quality to the reply that 
Jean finally sent back, &#39;Ororo, I&#39;m a bit busy right about now!&#39;

        &#39;It&#39;s Stryfe,&#39; Ororo replied firmly. A few scattered mental 
images leaked through to her, of two figures scrabling about on a bed, 
looking for their clothes. &#39;Guess I know what I interupted,&#39; she 
thought with a certain amount of amusesment.

        &#39;All right,&#39; Jean finally replied, an image appearing of the 
beautiful redhead sitting on her bed holding a sheet around her body, 
&#39;what&#39;s going on?&#39;

        Ororo&#39;s face was grim as she answered, &#39;We&#39;ve found where 
Stryfe is based, he&#39;s using the abandoned Reavers Outback town.&#39;

        &#39;Do you want us to mobilize a strike team? We can be out there 
to back you up in only a few hours,&#39; Jean quickly offered.

        &#39;No, just keep an eye on the situation,&#39; Ororo answered, &#39;if 
we fail, you and the others need to be ready. He&#39;ll attack the mansion 
after he&#39;s done here.&#39;

        &#39;Understood,&#39; Jean nodded firmly. She hesitated for a moment 
before adding, &#39;Please be careful, I don&#39;t want to loose you.&#39;

        &#39;I&#39;ll try my best,&#39; Ororo smiled slightly as the link was cut.

        Jean sat on the bed, shaking her head slightly. &quot;This is very, 
very bad,&quot; the telepath muttered as another woman smoothly rose from 
the bed.

        &quot;Agreed,&quot; Emma Frost nodded. The white haired telepath paused 
in pulling her clothes on before asking with a little smile, &quot;Do you 
think she knew who was in bed with you?&quot;

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Jean shrugged. She behgan to pull her clothes on, 
&quot;We&#39;ve got to let the Professor know, and see if we can track Scott 
down.&quot;

        &quot;Him and the other team leaders,&quot; Emma agreed.

        &quot;lets go,&quot; Jean agreed, slipping her uniform on.

        Before she left the rooom Emma gave Jean a slight smile, &quot;If 
Ororo did know, I wonder if we could talk her into a threesome?&quot;

        &quot;Emma!&quot; Jean slapped her arm, but the beauty only chuckled 
softly.

        Above the city of Sydney the X-men flew, the fliers carrying 
the other members with them. Mystique curled into Ororo&#39;s arms, &quot;Who 
was she in bed with?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Ororo answered firmly. Just a bit of a blush 
appeared on her cheeks, &quot;And to be honest, I&#39;m not sure I want to 
think about it.&quot;

        Kitty spoke up from where Rogue was gently carrying her, &quot;I 
used the remote access protocols to ready the Midnight Runner for 
takeoff.&quot;

        &quot;Are we going to go pick up Deathstryke?&quot; Sage asked 
curiously, Lifeguard carrying them both on metallic angel wings.

        &quot;Jet first,&quot; Psylocke answered, purplish telekinetic energies 
glowing around her as she carried Bishop, &quot;we can grab her on our way 
out.&quot;

        &quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Ororo agreed.

        They dropped down to the airport together, the team moving 
forward to the hanger. Neal shook his head admiringly as the 
Mediteranian young man looked at the sleek black jet, &quot;Is it me, or 
does it look like it could do Mach-2 sitting still?&quot;

        Kitty grinned as they popped the hatch, the team piling 
inside. &quot;Remind me to pass that on to Brian next time I see him,&quot; the 
brown haired girl laughed, &quot;he&#39;d love it.&quot;

        Bishop grabbed the weapons station, Sage swiftly dropping down 
in front of the electronic countermeasures seat. Rogue grabbed the 
co-pilot&#39;s seat, her white streak catching the light and waited a 
moment, then she turned back to yell, &quot;Pryde!&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Kitty made her way up before dropping down into the 
pilot&#39;s seat. She pulled the headset on before running through the 
preflight checklist. &quot;If anyone&#39;s got any calls to make, now&#39;s the 
time,&quot; she added.

        Heather grabed the phone first, calling up her little brother, 
Davis. They talked for a few minutes, her gently reassuring him that 
she was going to be all right. Heatherhung the phone up, &quot;I hope 
Stryfe doesn&#39;t make a liar of me.&quot;

        Sage reached back from her seat to lay her hand on Heather&#39;s. 
&quot;You&#39;ll be all right,&quot; Sage said quietly, &quot;I promise.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks&quot; Heather smiled.

        &quot;Cat,&quot; Bishop smiled slightly, &quot;Yeah, I can&#39;t make our date 
tonight.&quot; He smiled slightly as the fiery blonde complained on the 
other end, then shrugged, &quot;Saving the world, you know how it is.&quot; Much 
more softly he added, &quot;Love you.&quot;

        &quot;Aww,&quot; Neal grinned.

        Bishop put the phone down before giving Neal one of his more 
dangerous looks. &quot;Don&#39;t even think about it,&quot; he warned him coldly.

        &quot;Ah, right,&quot; Neal paled.

        Kitty shook her head with a smile, finishing her preperations. 
Rogue looked over at Kitty, &quot;Are you ready for this?&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Kitty admitted, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t really matter. I have 
to confront Sakura eventually, and now&#39;s as good a time as any.&quot;

        Rogue set her hand on her partners, their matching rings 
glinting. &quot;I&#39;ll back your play partner, no matter what,&quot; she softly 
reassured her.

        Kitty squeezed Rogue&#39;s hands between her own, &quot;And I&#39;ll back 
you, too.&quot;

        Ororo settled into her seat beside Raven before speaking up, 
&quot;Are we ready to go?&quot;

        A burst of thrust pushing them all back into their seats was 
Kitty&#39;s answer.

        Yuriko paced her suite, an odd tension filling her. Something 
was happening, she just knew it, but what? A flash of reflecting glass 
caught her eye and she looked out her window only to freeze in shock. 
A sleek black plane, similar to a fighter design, gracefully weaved 
it&#39;s way through the buildings towards her own building.

        &quot;Stryfe?&quot; Yuriko murmured to her softly, shrugging off her 
outer clothes to reveal a simple jumpsuit underneath, her 
finger-blades extending smoothly. The jet came to a stop just off from 
her balcony, and for a moment she marveled at the skills of the pilot.

        A hatch in the side opened up, and Storm was revealed standing 
there, her hand extended. &quot;We&#39;re going after Stryfe,&quot; she said simply, 
&quot;care to join us?&quot;

        Yuriko took a few steps back, turned around, ran forward to 
leap off the porch and into the open hatch. &quot;Of course,&quot; the graceful 
asian cyborg smiled at her coolly, &quot;I&#39;ve been looking forward to it.&quot; 
As she made her way to a open seat she saw Kitty in the pilot seat and 
smiled slightly, &quot;Of course.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Heather looked at her curiously.

        &quot;I was admiring the pilot&#39;s skills,&quot; Yuriko admitted, &quot;it just 
seems fitting it was Pryde.&quot; She looked over at Storm, &quot;So, do you 
have a plan?&quot;

        The entire cabin was clearly paying attention, waiting to hear 
her words. &quot;We&#39;ll deal with the Brotherhood first,&quot; Storm said 
crisply, &quot;as well as deal with any restored Reaver cyborgs. Once we do 
that, we go after Stryfe himself.&quot;

        &quot;Is he as powerful as he was when we last faced him?&quot; Yuriko 
asked thoughtfully.

        &quot;More, possibly,&quot; Sage answered this time.

        Yuriko smiled a dangerous little smile, &quot;Good. It should make 
for an enjoyable fight, then.&quot;

        &quot;Is it me,&quot; Rogue said softly to Kitty, &quot;or is she starting to 
sound like Logan?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not you,&quot; Kitty smiled back, &quot;maybe if you fight against 
Wolverine long enough, you start to become like him?&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s a scary thought,&quot; Rogue chuckled.

        Once they made their way out of the city itself the Midnight 
Runner hugged the ground, the sleek black jet flying only meters above 
the densely packed Earth. Sage manned the ECM station even as she 
softly said to Storm, &quot;We might be able to go in undetected, but it 
all depends on how well Stryfe has upgraded the town&#39;s systems.&quot;

        &quot;All we can do is try,&quot; Storm answered.

        In the command center beneath the outback town an alarm 
sounded. With a few flicks of switches Sakura brought the survelence 
systems online, looking at the silouette that was racing across the 
Outback towards them.

        &quot;The X-men are on the move,&quot; Feral&#39;s soft purr didn&#39;t surprise 
Sakura, she had known the orange furred girl was lurking around, 
&quot;Think they know we&#39;re out here?&quot;

        &quot;It would be a bit much of a coincidence, especially 
considering their covert approach here,&quot; Sakura said dryly. The white 
haired ninja frowned slightly, &quot;But lord Stryfe and McCoy are still 
sealed away, and we don&#39;t dare disturb them.&quot;

        &quot;Guess we&#39;ll just have to make do with what we have. I&#39;ll go 
wake Plasma and Polaris,&quot; Feral headed to the chamber door, &quot;uncrate 
Nemesis, and get the Reaver-bots going.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re being awfully helpful,&quot; Sakura looked over at the 
catgirl in surprise, &quot;but I&#39;m wondering why, exactly?&quot;

        Feral looked back with a little smile, &quot;Maybe I&#39;m hoping for a 
reward later, Mistress.&quot;

        Sakura sweatdropped, watching her walk away with her hips 
swaying.

        A soft chime, and Sakura looked up to see a distance countdown 
appear on the screen. &#39;My confrontation with Pryde is nearly here,&#39; 
she mused, &#39;so why do I feel so... empty, inside?&#39;
