<h1>A Hard Thing to Confess</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>    This came completely outta nowhere! O_o I was watching part 1 of 
the 7th Heaven season 4 finale, and when I saw the scene where Deena was 
talking to her friend Cynthia about why she wanted to break it off with 
Simon...somehow, her lines about it being better he didn&#39;t know the truth 
screamed femslash to me. *nervous laugh* I know the REAL reason was she 
was moving away and stuff, but the way she was talking, and how close she 
seemed with Cynthia made me think of a girl being afraid to tell a guy 
she&#39;d been dating that she was breaking up with him for another girl.
    But I&#39;ve rambled enough here. This fic is pretty innocent-nothing 
more than kissing goes on-but it&#39;s pretty angsty. Hopefully not TOO 
angsty.

                ~

&quot;You&#39;re really good. I almost believed you myself,&quot; Deena said, smiling 
slightly despite the guilt she felt.

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s a gift.&quot; Her raven-haired companion laughed softly. &quot;Simon&#39;s 
really a nice guy, though. He obviously likes you a lot,&quot; she said. Deena 
sighed.

&quot;And I really like him, Cynthia,&quot; she said. &quot;That&#39;s why...&quot; She paused, 
tears filling her eyes. &quot;That&#39;s why I can&#39;t tell him the truth.&quot;

&quot;Deena...&quot; Cynthia looked at the other girl, her face becoming serious. &quot;I 
know this is hard for you. It&#39;s been hard for us both. But...Simon really 
cares about you. Are you sure...?&quot;

&quot;I hate to do this, Cynthia,&quot; Deena choked. &quot;But...if he hates me for 
supposedly cheating on him, then it&#39;ll be easier for him to forget about 
me and move on.&quot; Her shoulders shook as the tears began to fall. Cynthia 
sat down on the bed and put her arms around the brunette.

&quot;You miss him, don&#39;t you?&quot; she said, stroking Deena&#39;s hair.

&quot;Yeah...he&#39;s a great guy and I really care about him...and we&#39;ve been 
through so much,&quot; Deena sniffled. &quot;But I just can&#39;t feel for him the way 
he feels for me anymore.&quot; She paused. &quot;I...I can&#39;t stand the thought of 
hurting him.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

After a moment of silence, Deena sighed.

&quot;But...eventually we&#39;ll have to tell him about us,&quot; she said.

&quot;It&#39;s not going to be easy,&quot; Cynthia warned her gently.

&quot;I know...&quot;

Deena rested her head on her girlfriend&#39;s shoulder, closing her eyes 
momentarily.

&quot;But...I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll understand in time,&quot; she said, a weak smile crossing 
her lips. &quot;Hey, if he&#39;s really the guy I think he is, he will. And...I 
don&#39;t think Simon would be that put off.&quot;

&quot;Yeah! That&#39;s more like it,&quot; Cynthia said brightly. &quot;Think positive, 
Deena, everything&#39;ll work out somehow.&quot;

Deena lifted her head, and for the first time that night, smiled a genuine 
smile.

&quot;Thanks...I feel better now,&quot; she said.

&quot;Good.&quot;

&quot;You always manage to make me feel better,&quot; Deena said. &quot;I love you, 
Cynthia.&quot;

&quot;I love you too, Deena,&quot; Cynthia whispered before leaning in and kissing 
her.

                ~End~


    This turned out a bit longer than I expected...but then again, I 
wasn&#39;t speculating on how long it&#39;d be in the first place, so it&#39;s all 
good. :)
    Like me Brady Bunch femslash fic &quot;True Colors&quot;, this also centers 
on a relationship involving a minor character...in fact, it takes it a 
step further, pairing a minor character who left after 2 seasons and was 
never heard from again after a couple cameos in season 5 with an even MORE 
minor character who was only in a couple scenes. O_o What is it with me 
and minor characters in USTV fics? *nervous laugh* Ah, well. I&#39;m rather 
proud of this fic, it was somewhat fun to write. :)
