Happiness. Being content. It didn&#39;t take long. It surprised me, but then 
again I hadn&#39;t felt so peaceful before. It was the thing that parted us. 
The girl and me. I got out and looked at the scissors. He had thought of 
everything.

She was awake too. I gave her the scissors and my body. There was no 
mirror. I couldn&#39;t see what she did. It felt good afterwards though.

From what I could tell she had cut my hair just nicely. It was shorter 
than hers and not as loose, but it was okay. The ponytail was just in 
the way anyway. I put the scrunchie around my wrist.

The room was a bit messy. He had thought of that too though. The bloody 
clothes and the brown hair clippings filled the box. I took the shredded 
paper from the table and stuffed it into the box too. Then I closed it. 
The cardboard box. I opened the window and placed it outside. He would 
find it there if he needed it back.

I lay down in the bed again. The oder of the clothes. It was good. Now 
she carried the very same scent. The girl followed me. Snuggled up close 
to me. I put an arm around her and drifted off. We were alone in the 
world.

Meadow. A meadow stretched before me. I sat down in the lush grass right 
next to the girl who was wearing the same blue dress. She was smiling. 
He was there too. He was also smiling. He sat down in front of me.

Uniform. One form. Same appearance. Unity through clothes. He nodded at 
my hair. It wasn&#39;t just the clothes now. He removed some hair strands 
from my eye and put it behind my ear with his fingertips. He was 
protecting me. He had been all along.

Laughter. He entertained the girl and gave me time to look around. It 
was a valley. A valley filled with grass and a few trees. There was no 
water. I gazed at the hills that surrounded it all. They were steep and 
looked a little like a fence. The only way out were three paths where 
the hills suddenly opened up. One to the left, one to the right, and one 
behind. I wondered where we had come from. Perhaps they weren&#39;t really 
roads.

Picture. It wasn&#39;t real. None of it. It was a fantasy picture I had 
drawn once. Well, all the monsters were gone. Now it was just us. The 
valley was pretty, but scentless. It was like the cabin. He needed to 
talk somewhere and chose a place where I felt safe. Or maybe not safe. 
Home perhaps. But how did he know?

Obvious. He saw right through me and calmed me down. He told me about 
the key and what I should do. It was just like that. Simple. Somehow I 
knew all this. He just had to make sure I was certain. His presence had 
faded though. He wasn&#39;t as wonderful as before. My belly didn&#39;t tickle 
when he spoke anymore. Yet it felt like there was nothing wrong. It was 
the way it was supposed to be. I wasn&#39;t scared.

It was dark when we awoke. So dark. I couldn&#39;t see much. I felt her body 
next to me. The nurse room was still quiet. Nobody was around. The 
darkness wasn&#39;t right. We couldn&#39;t have slept that long. Or could we?

I had forgotten to ask him. Again. It was like whenever he was around 
I&#39;d forget all the little things. I hadn&#39;t asked for a mirror either. I 
wanted to see myself more than ever. And the time. And the monsters. And 
the woman. Now it was too late to say anything.

She read me easily. Maybe I was just being obvious. She said it. The 
girl said I was pretty. No, beautiful. Her nose tip touched mine and I 
smiled. I told her the same. There was no reason to say anything else. 
This was enough.

Someone slammed the front door shut. It was blurry. We got up and 
hurried out in the hallway. Left. There was someone. I turned right and 
pulled the girl along. A door. It was unlocked. We hurried through as a 
light started shining somewhere behind. I shut it and turned the lock.

It was another hallway. This one lead to classes and there were stairs 
to the second floor and the basement. I didn&#39;t bother hiding anywhere. I 
sat down and leaned against the door. The one on the other side tried to 
open it.

Tap, tap, tap, and tap. The beat sent chills down my spine. There was 
something in this hallway too. It made a noise somewhere in the 
darkness. It came closer. No. They came closer.
