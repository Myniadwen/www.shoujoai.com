<a href="../nonanime/excalibur-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>        The sun was only just coming up, and Pete found himself in the 
kitchen, dressed in a black track suit and drinking a cup of coffee from 
a pot that someone else had already made. &#39;Wonder who else is up this 
early?&#39; he thought.

        &quot;Good morning, Pete,&quot; Rhane smiled up at him as the green 
nightie clad girl reached for the coffee pot, &quot;Dani makes great coffee, 
doesn&#39;t she?&quot;

        &quot;Hmm,&quot; Pete agreed as he took a slurp, &quot;good coffee.&quot; The black 
haired Englishman hesitated for a moment, &quot;How&#39;s the powers situation 
with you?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m back at full strength,&quot; Rhane reassured him, the little 
redhead smiling gently.

        Pete shrugged slightly as he explained, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to ask in 
front of the others, just in case it was bad news.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Rhane smiled. She poured another cup, making it up the 
way she knew Dani liked it, &quot;I&#39;ll see you later, all right?&quot;

        &quot;See you,&quot; he smiled. Rhane was almost like a happy puppy as she 
trotted off carrying the cups of coffee for her lover and her. Pete took 
his own cup with him as he stepped outside, drinking and enjoying the 
crisp morning air.

        A few minutes later the figure shimmered slightly, almost 
looking like he was materializing from the fog before him. The costume 
he wore was white, a red shield on his chest, hood and cape floating 
around him. On the shield itself was a golden lion, rearing up in 
battle. The man settled on the rough ground not far from Pete.

        &quot;I&#39;d still like to know how you even managed to contact me,&quot; the 
man finally said.

        &quot;Albion,&quot; Pete nodded a greeting.

        Once a mystical champion who had fought for Britain during both 
the first and second world wars, Albion had dropped out of sight many 
years ago. Now an old man, Albion&#39;s powers had recently been restored to 
him, granting him the ability to become a young man once again.

        With a wry smile Pete said, &quot;I&#39;m still friends with Brian 
Braddock, who helped with the Knights of Pendragon, of which you are a 
member.&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; the man smiled wryly. Albion fixed him with an 
intense gaze, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say I must decline membership in Excalibur.&quot;

        Pete didn&#39;t look too terribly devastated, somehow. &quot;I really 
wasn&#39;t expecting you to,&quot; he admitted, &quot;but I thought I should make you 
the offer.&quot;

        Albion actually smiled slightly, &quot;Then thank you, for 
remembering an old man.&quot; Without a sound he disappeared into the mists, 
a silent shadow disappearing, but his final words lingered, &quot;I will be 
there, if there is a real need.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Pete raised his cup in salute. He stood there a while, 
enjoying the peace while finishing off his cup of coffee. Somehow, he 
rather suspected that he wasn&#39;t going to have such moments all that 
often.

        BOOM!

        The thunder crack split the air, and Pete jumped in surprise, 
his coffee spilling on the ground even as the hot blades formed from his 
fingers instinctively. With a laugh Britannia soared on by, clearly 
enjoying the power of light.

        &quot;This is great!&quot; the woman laughed happily, the mist rippling 
from the sonic boom Britannia had just generated.

        Pete took a moment to calm down, not to mention letting his 
heart recover from the shock. He really wanted to yell something rude at 
her, but the black garbed woman was having such a good time he just 
couldn&#39;t seem to manage it.

        &#39;Must be getting soft in my old age,&#39; Pete thought, and with a 
soft sigh he headed in, to get some more coffee and maybe something to 
eat.

        &quot;Mornin&#39; Pete,&quot; Rachel mumbled, her red hair standing up, messy 
from sleep. She looked around the small kitchen, latching onto the 
coffee happily, completely unconcerned that she was wearing T-shirt, 
panties, and nothing else.

        Trying not to look at her too hard Pete got another coffee and 
retreated to the monitor room. He had to think about how to approach his 
next recruit, and drinking it in there would help keep him out of 
trouble, hopefully.

        Pete got halfway through it when there was a knock at the door. 
Lisa stood with her costume helmet under her arm, her short blonde hair 
plastered down from wearing it. She smiled cautiously, &quot;Could I ask you 
something?&quot;

        &quot;Come on in,&quot; Pete gestured her to one of the seats at the 
table.

        Lisa took a seat, setting the helm down beside her. Athletic, 
with a clearly capable manner, a top agent of STRIKE and WHO before they 
decided to cut her loose. With an engaging smile she said, &quot;I rather 
like the idea of the team living on the island, but there&#39;s one little 
problem.&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Pete raised an eyebrow, drinking a bit before putting the 
cup back down.

        Lisa actually blushed a bit as she confessed, &quot;I have a 
girlfriend, and I&#39;d really rather not have us living in separate 
places.&quot;

        &quot;I assume WHO had her checked out?&quot; Pete asked curiously.

        &quot;Hm,&quot; Lisa nodded glumly. &quot;Just having a girlfriend was enough 
to make the Minister give me the boot, even though she checked out 
clean,&quot; she scowled.

        &quot;Well, I don&#39;t see any problem,&quot; Pete shrugged.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Lisa reached out to shake his hand firmly, &quot;I&#39;ll call 
her, let her know she can come out to the island in the next few days.&quot; 
Picking up her helmet off the table she turned and left, whistling to 
herself cheerfully.

        Pete watched her go, remembering the last time he had a 
girlfriend, then shook his head. &#39;Time to get to work,&#39; he thought, 
finishing off his coffee and then picking up the phone. He tapped the 
number in, then smiled wryly as a maid picked up the phone. &quot;Could I 
speak with Lady Crighton, please? It&#39;s a matter of some urgency,&quot; he 
smiled.

        A few minutes later in his room Pete finished changing into one 
of his black suits with tie. He strode out and went down a few doors, 
tapping on one. &quot;Kate, you in there?&quot;

        &quot;Come in,&quot; her oddly distorted voice answered.

        Pete opened up the door, stepped inside then froze in surprise. 
Kate&#39;s metallic body sat there limply on the bed, slumped over like a 
puppet with it&#39;s strings cut. It was an odd gray color, almost as if the 
life that animated it had been entirely removed. Just above the robotic 
shell a glowing blob floated, shining with rainbow lights.

        &quot;Kate?&quot; Pete asked weakly.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; the lob answered, then the rainbow lights seemed to 
flow into the body on the bed. It jerked, twitched a few times, then the 
eyes opened up. Somehow it changed, the life returning to the metallic 
form. &quot;Just stretching my legs, or something,&quot; Kate smiled.

        &quot;I keep forgetting that you&#39;re an energy being,:&quot; Pete admitted. 
He shook himself, &quot;Do you think you could transport me to the Crighton 
residence?&quot;

        &quot;No problem,&quot; Kate got up off the bed, stretching a bit. They 
walked out together as she curiously asked, &quot;So who are you leaving in 
charge?&quot;

        &quot;Since I&#39;m taking you with me,&quot; Pete shrugged, &quot;Dani Moonstar.&quot;

        Kate raised an elegant metal eyebrow, &quot;I take it I&#39;m your second 
in command?&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re one of the most experienced team members,&quot; Pete 
shrugged. He looked over at her curiously, &quot;You mind?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m complimented,&quot; Kate answered with a smile.

        Letting the others know he was leaving and that Dani was in 
charge while he was gone went pretty well, though he did notice a slight 
frown on Lisa&#39;s face. &#39;Guess I&#39;ll have to keep an eye on that, too,&#39; he 
thought wryly.

        &quot;Ready?&quot; Kate smiled before rising up into the air, the rainbow 
lights within her forming the teleportational portal. Pete leapt 
through, Kate followed, and the portal faded to nothingness.

        The manor house that the two of them walked up to was an old 
English home, the kind of place that gets passed down through the 
generations and almost becomes one of the family, much like a grouchy 
great aunt. The doorbell rang deep and low, the sort of sound you feel 
in your bones.

        &quot;Why do I feel like a bit player in a drama off the telly?&quot; Kate 
asked, safely disguised beneath the illusion of her previous human form.

        Pete&#39;s lips quirked a bit, but he didn&#39;t have time to answer 
before the door swung open. The young woman looked like she was in her 
teens, the only thing off being her pure white hair. &quot;Lady Crighton,&quot; 
Pete smiled, &quot;Thank you for seeing us on such short notice...&quot;

        Before Pete could finish the sentence the woman grabbed him, 
slamming him up against the wall before he could even blink. &quot;I do not 
care for people like you,&quot; Jacqueline Crighton said simply, &quot;who use 
hints and insinuations to secure a meeting with me.&quot;

        Kate looked ready to jump in, and Pete waved a hand to let her 
know it was all right. &quot;My apologies,&quot; he said calmly, &quot;but you aren&#39;t 
an easy woman to contact.&quot;

        Jacqueline met his eyes, her gaze intent. &quot;All right,&quot; she 
reluctantly loosened her grip on his collar, &quot;then let&#39;s talk.&quot;</pre>
