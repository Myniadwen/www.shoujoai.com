<h1>Day and Night (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a>

<pre>The red haired, violet skinned gargoyle gracefully landed on the roof of 
the Manhattan townhouse, her eyes narrowed a bit as the sky began to 
noticably lighten. &quot;It&#39;s nearly dawn,&quot; she murmured as she pulled her 
wings in around her like a cloak and opened up the window, climbing into 
the attic.

As the first rays of dawn came Demona gave a strangled cry of agony as 
she began to change. Her pointed ears pulled in, skin lightening to a 
healthy pink even as her wings shriveled and shrank away. In moments she 
was left gasping, leaning up against the wall fully human as the pain 
slowly faded away.

&quot;Blast that Puck,&quot; the still redheaded but human Demona muttered as she 
walked to the ladder down from the attic, &quot;does the change have to hurt 
so damn much?&quot; As she climbed down the ladder and walked to her room, 
Demona once again mused on the idea of trying some kind of narcotic for 
the pain. &#39;No,&#39; she mused as she calmly stripped off her loin cloth and 
crude top, &#39;I doubt it would effect me as a gargoyle anyway.&#39;

Stepping into the bathroom connected to her room Demona turned on the 
shower, noting it was one of the few inventions by humans she approved 
of. Hot water blasted pain-sweat away and she lathered up her hair, 
careful to remove any traces of the night&#39;s traveling. Emerging from the 
shower she toweled herself off, then strode into the bedroom to dress.

In a few minutes the identity that Demona presented to the outside world 
was ready to go, and right on time business woman Dominique Destine left 
her home to a waiting limo. &quot;Miss Destine,&quot; her executive assistant 
respectfully nodded as Demona climbed in, her blonde hair gleaming, 
&quot;good morning.&quot;

&quot;Alicia,&quot; Demona smiled slightly as the door closed and the limo 
soundlessly glided into New York traffic.

Alicia Sevarius was one of those unique little bonuses that sometimes 
just fall into one&#39;s lap. The relative of Anton Sevarius, the radical 
genetisist and mad scientist, she had come to Demona&#39;s attention during 
her first attempts to work with the scientist. She had a skill set that 
Demona appreciated, and even better she was potentially a useful lever 
to induce Sevarius to work for her in the future. Even more oddly Demona 
found herself liking this young lady, almost as much as she had once 
liked MacBeth. It was a annoying emotion, but one she was doing her best 
to cope with.

&quot;Your schedule is as full as ever,&quot; Alicia said as she gracefully pulled 
out a Cyberbiotics brand PDA from her dress jacket pocket and tapped the 
touch screen to call up the list, &quot;there&#39;s a meeting with Xanatos 
enterprises regarding the Oberon situation, representatives of the 
European branch of Cyberbiotics are here investigating a possible 
alliance and the private investigator that you hired will be in this 
afternoon.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Alicia,&quot; Demona nodded. Thinking a moment she said, &quot;I&#39;ll 
see Xanatos&#39; man first, then contact the investigator. Cyberbiotics just 
flew over?&quot;

&quot;They arrived last night,&quot; Alicia confirmed.

&quot;They&#39;re probably jet lagged,&quot; Demona said, once more amused by 
humanity&#39;s general weakness, &quot;phone and confirm when they want to meet. 
I&#39;d bet this afternoon.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Alicia made a note.

Occasionally Demona wondered what Alicia thought of her strange 
employer, but she usual dismissed such questions. So far her primary 
concern was keeping Alicia loyal but partially in the dark, a complex 
task considering Alicia was her right hand. Often Demona wished for a 
employee like Owen Burnett or Preston Vogel, but on the other hand the 
sheer amorality of both men made her value Alicia&#39;s honesty, even if it 
made things difficult at times.

The limo pulled up in front of the building housing Nightstone Unlimited 
and parked, the young driver jumping out so that he could get the door 
for them. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Demona said, having reminded herself more than 
once to use standard human courtesies.

The upper levels gleamed as Demona strode through the lobby of the 
company, the stylish young man at the front desk nodding, &quot;Good morning, 
Ms Destine.&quot;

&quot;Morning,&quot; Demona nodded as she and Alicia strode into her office. She 
took off her suit coat, revealing her simple dress and white blouse and 
hung up the coat by the door. Sitting behind her desk she reviewed the 
newest documents in her in box as she asked, &quot;Any progress on repairing 
the statue I recovered?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re bringing in some experts on primitive sculpture from Europe using 
our contacts with Cyberbiotics,&quot; Alicia said, &quot;as you&#39;ve expressed 
reluctance to bring in the New York University staff.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Demona nearly snarled but restrained herself.

The New York University was a major force in antiquities of all types, 
and normally Demona would have been glad for the help. However, the 
current head of the department was one Lennox MacDuff, whom she had 
known as MacBeth, the timeless adversary who had hunted her through the 
ages for their mutual betrayal.

&quot;The praying gargoyle statue,&quot; Alicia looked curious, &quot;it&#39;s that 
valuable?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Demona said after a moments reflection, &quot;it just has a certain 
sentimental value.&quot;

Alicia nodded, &quot;I understand.&quot;

&#39;I rather doubt you do,&#39; Demona thought wryly. Aloud she said briskly, 
&quot;I&#39;d best prepare for the Xanatos meeting, please see that I&#39;m not 
disturbed.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Alicia said respectfully before heading out the door.

Demona sat back as she enjoyed the privacy of her office, considering 
the recent events in her life. The return of the Hunters and the outing 
of New York&#39;s Gargoyles were both matters of concern, as was the 
infiltration of her company by that bitch, Robyn. Already she had 
ordered password changes throughout the company, and her investigator 
was tracking down any bombs hidden in the mainframes. It was slow going, 
but she was not risking a crippling computer attack from a determined 
advesary.

The Gargoyles were another problem. Goliath seemed persistantly blind to 
the treachery these humans could inflict, and his unwavering defence of 
them made him her enemy. Worse, he had her daughter Angela in his 
clutches, poisoning her mind to anything she said. Freeing her would 
require time and patience, neither of which were her forte.

The final item on her agenda, the annoying humans, would have to be 
tabled for a time. The praying gargoyle statue was necessary in her 
enchantment to protect their kind, without it any attempt to eliminate 
the humans with a bioweapon was far too dangerous. As well, there was 
the half human gargoyle Delilah to consider. As much as she loathed the 
idea of her DNA being mixed with that bitch Elisa Maza, the clone was 
blood kin, and could potentially be useful. She had to be sure any 
attack on humanity spared her, too.

&quot;Miss,&quot; Alicia&#39;s voice came over the intercom, &quot;your appointment with 
Xanatos Enterprises is here.&quot; She paused before adding softly, &quot;It&#39;s 
him!&quot;

&quot;Send Mr. Xanatos in.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Alicia Sevarius smiled up at David Xanatos, feeling oddly chilled 
despite his handsome appearance. &quot;Please, go right in,&quot; she said to the 
brown haired man in the expensive suit.

&quot;Thank you, my dear,&quot; David Xanatos gave her a polite nod, his voice 
nearly oozing charm before heading into Ms. Dustine&#39;s office.

&quot;Brrr,&quot; Alicia shivered a bit.

Returning to her work Alicia tried to focus on the details of the 
upcoming meeting with Cyberbiotics, but her employer&#39;s lovely face 
seemed to intrude on her thoughts. She admired Ms. Destine greatly, of 
course, but she was growing concerned that her feelings for her employer 
were growing into something more.

&#39;Which is impossible,&#39; Alicia reminded herself firmly.

Dominique Destine was a powerful and dynamic woman, both incredibly 
wealthy and attractive. More than one man and a few women too had looked 
to court her, possibly to gain access to her power or riches, but 
Dominique had rebuffed them all. At work she maintained a careful 
distance too, being politely friendly with her employees but not letting 
anyone too close.

&#39;Like me,&#39; Alicia sighed. Her various attempts to be closer to Dominique 
had all failed, and she had reluctantly accepted that the other woman 
was simply not interested in being friends.

Soon the day began to rush forwards like most days, calls and 
appointments keeping them busy as time passed. Soon the evening came, 
and like most days Nightstone began to shut down as the sun lowered in 
the sky. It was a odd quirk of Dominique&#39;s that their New York office 
always close before sundown, but most of the staff had gradually 
accepted it.

Cleaning up her desk Alicia rose, walking over to the boss&#39; office door 
and knocking as she called, &quot;Miss Destine?&quot;

&quot;Come in,&quot; Dominique answered.

As Alicia opened the door she saw the other woman gazing out over the 
city, her eyes drawn to the massive Aerie building of Xanatos&#39;. Her red 
hair flowed freely, her clothes flapping gently from the breeze and she 
looked mysterious and beautiful in the reddish glow of the evening sun.

&quot;I&#39;m going now,&quot; Alicia said quietly, &quot;is there anything I can do before 
I go?&quot;

Dominique turned, her eyes almost looking like they were glowing red in 
the light. &quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; she said, &quot;and take the limo home, if you 
wish. I have a evening appointment I have to keep.&quot;

Knowing if would be foolish to offer to stay, Alicia just nodded. &quot;I 
think I&#39;ll walk home,&quot; she answered, &quot;it&#39;s still warm out.&quot;

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Dominique said briskly, &quot;you never know what&#39;s wandering 
the night.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Alicia said, turning and leaving. The sun had fully set by 
the time Alicia had left the building, talking to the security guys as 
they locked up the main entrance. Bundling her coat around her Alicia 
headed out, mentally planning her evening. First she would get dinner at 
that nice little caf&eacute;, them maybe see a show...

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Demona stretched her wings, glad once more to have abandoned her human 
form for her true gargoyle shape. With a single sweep of her wings she 
glided from the roof of the Nightstone headquarters, soaring on warm 
currents of air as she watched humanity below her.

As fast as a limo could go, a gargoyle could soar much faster if the 
conditions were right. With ease Demona soared above the streets, 
wondering with some amusement how the humans might react to seeing her. 
&#39;Likely wet themselves with fear,&#39; she silently mused.

A flash of gold caught her eyes and Demona smiled, recognizing Alicia as 
she strode along a empty street. Alighting on a nearby roof she watched 
her, taking in the girl in these different circumstances. Compared to a 
gargoyle female Alicia was scrawny and weak, yet there was a certain 
glow of vitality about her, a kind of beauty.

As a figure began to follow Alicia Demona tensed, a growl starting in 
the back of her throat. &#39;Little fool,&#39; she thought as she took to wing 
to follow, &#39;does she not see him?&#39; Apparently not, for Alicia walked on 
obliviously.

Alicia turned to a street nearby her home and Demona clenched her teeth, 
seeing how dark and deserted it was. Soaring down she hovered above, her 
first instinct to sweep Alicia to safety. &#39;What am I doing?&#39; she 
wondered, &#39;I&#39;m not like Goliath and those other weaklings. I don&#39;t 
protect these human vermin!&#39;

Yet as the man moved up to grab Alicia, Demona moved. &quot;Eeek!&quot; Alica 
squealed as she was grabbed from behind, then suddenly was released as 
the man screamed in shock.

With deceptive ease Demona hefted the mugger, looking him right into the 
eye as she hissed, &quot;This street is under my protection, scum.&quot; With that 
she hammered him into the wall, blood splattering as his nose broke and 
he fell unconscious to the ground.

&quot;You...&quot; Alicia stammered, gazing at her in shock under the weak street 
lamp&#39;s light.

Dropping her voice a bit Demona gruffly asked, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Alicia breathed out before fainting dead away.

&#39;Not the reaction I was expecting,&#39; Demona admitted.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;It was incredible,&quot; Alicia raved as they rode together in the limo the 
next morning, &quot;I was sure I was dead, but then she saved me!&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re certain she was a gargoyle?&quot; Dominique asked, hiding a 
smile.

&quot;I may not have gotten a long look, but yes,&quot; Alicia agreed. She 
frowned, &quot;She was lovely, too... with hair nearly as red as yours, but 
dark blueish skin and purple wings.&quot; She sighed, &quot;I just wish I hadn&#39;t 
fainted.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Dominique said, &quot;maybe you&#39;ll see her again.&quot; A sudden smile, 
&quot;Maybe you&#39;ve even acquired yourself a guardian angel.&quot;

End...?

Notes: I&#39;ve always had a fondness for Demona, despite her many flaws. 
She remains incapable of seeing that most of the bad stuff that has 
happened around her has been her own fault...</pre>
