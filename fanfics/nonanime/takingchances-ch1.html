<h1>Taking Chances</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../nonanime/index.html">Non-Anime Fanfiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/manlyman.html">Manly Man</a><br> </h2>
<P>To <I>mug</I> someone; such a strong phrase, one used to inspire fear, anger and hatred 
in the souls of society's various members. It defined which sort of method of thievery in 
particular the said criminal had used. It meant that the one who relieved their victim of 
their possessions was evil, cold-hearted, but most of all, it meant that they had not a 
whit of class.</P><P><I>Mugging</I> was something that only the stupid, violent and 
desperate- not to mention the tasteless- resorted to. Finesse was required to be able to 
steal anything worth the trouble of it, anyway. Charm and guile were necessary to go 
undercover and escape without anyone being the wiser. Skill was the key ingredient in the 
formula for theft. And yet, those who <I>mugged</I> others continued their selfish, 
ignorant and self-destructive ways, beating meager rewards out of the weak while the 
professionals made careful, perfect moves that synchronized with all possible factors of 
the job and reaped immense bounties.</P><P>Jinx was most certainly not a <I>mugger</I>. She 
was a pickpocket, cutpurse, nicker, footpad, perhaps even a heart stealer, considering the 
attractiveness she had. She'd definitely gotten that Kid Flash's blood pumping, considering 
his attempts to woo her. Playing hard-to-get was a favorite pass-time of hers, and how she 
subtly stole things from those who fawned over her without them even realizing it was just 
so exhilarating and entertaining at the same time. The enjoyment Jinx could wring from her 
antics was almost disturbing with how sinister it was in nature. The sorceress was well 
aware of how sadistic it may have looked, but she didn't care; it was simply a part of who 
she was.</P><P>And so, her own pleasure in mind, Jinx slunk like some sort of black cat 
through the crowds of Jump City, mingling with the populace, somehow going unnoticed. 
Several were already victims of her dexterous hands and fingertips, their wallets and 
coin-purses having been slipped from their possession, oblivious to the 
thievery.</P><P><I>Swipe</I>.</P><P>A man's fat wallet was now hers, and she slipped it 
into the rapidly filling pocket of her slate gray hoodie. As soon as Jinx had wandered far 
enough away from the crowd to safely examine her prize, she pulled out the wallet and 
dipped inside its folds. Counting the bills, she grinned at the two hundred and fourteen 
dollars she now had. A thought soon came to her as she pondered what to do next. Why not 
challenge herself, replacing the wallet in the man's pocket? Jinx had to put genuine effort 
into not stretching a Cheshire smile across her face as she slid back into the masses, 
following her most recent gudgeon.</P><P>The man had a swagger that advertised his 
unawareness that his money was missing. Jinx snaked between those who were in the way, and 
in a few mere moments, the metahuman thief followed him so closely she could smell the 
faint scent of the detergent he'd used regularly on his clothing. Her deft fingers working 
quickly, Jinx slipped the wallet into the man's back pocket, giving his rump a light tap as 
she twirled away. He stopped very suddenly, his eyes scouring the place for whoever had 
violated him... not that he minded, but still.</P><P>He saw Jinx stepping away, grinning 
widely and giving him a small wave as she retreated into a dark alleyway. Placing his hand 
where she touched him, he felt his wallet, and then gasped, for his wallet hadn't been in 
that pocket when he last checked. Turning back in her direction, he cursed aloud- Jinx was 
nowhere to be found.</P><P>Maniacal cackling could be heard as Jinx revelled with 
satisfaction in the success of her ploy. Her wicked laughter grew to be too much, and she 
doubled over, gripping her sides in pain while she choked on her crowing. Barely able to 
calm herself down, Jinx panted heavily in between the fading giggles, hardly able to stand 
properly. Her hand was pressed over her heart, still struggling to breathe while she strode 
onto the sidewalk once more.</P><P>!</P><P>An iced mocha sounded rather delicious at the 
moment. A pink tongue licked over plump, black lips while the customer in question 
considered what exactly she was to order from the coffee shop that she stood in. Perhaps a 
cappuccino, or a frappé fashioned with vanilla cream? She couldn't decide, they all sounded 
so good! After contemplating her situation thoroughly, the girl decided that she would take 
one of each. Caffeine did, after all, make her world go round.</P><P>Her order made, paid 
for and received, Argent stepped to the table she'd chosen and set down her three drinks. 
Picking up the cappuccino first, she gave it a sip, nodding her approval to the taste, 
before slurping down the entire drink in a few swallows. A smack of the lips and a sigh as 
she felt the warmth trail down into her belly, and Argent could already sense the sugar 
kicking in. Soon she was already sucking down the mocha, the contrasting in temperatures 
between it and the cappuccino producing a shockwave of sensations in her esophagus and 
stomach.</P><P>Moaning with pleasure as she experienced the jolt inside, Argent's moment of 
Nirvana was soon interrupted; two men wearing ski masks and wielding nine-millimeter 
pistols kicked in the glass door, one of them firing a bullet into the ceiling. "This 
here's a robbery! As long as you stay where you are and hand over all your cash, nobody 
gets hurt!" the trigger-happy criminal roared.</P><P>Argent, who was distinctly irritated 
by this intrusion, stood from the stool and barked at themn "Oi! What's a girl got t'do to 
enjoy her java 'round here?"</P><P>The other robber turned to her and fired a bullet, 
hitting her frappé and making it explode all over the table. At that her face reddened with 
genuine anger. "Blimey, you insufferable gits have no respect, do you?"</P><P>In answer to 
that, the first one yelled, "Shut up, bitch!" as he fired a shot directly at her- which 
flattened against a shield of silver energy.</P><P>This time, Argent's face was what showed 
off just how pissed she really was, contorting into an expression of fury. Without saying a 
word, the shield molded itself into a gigantic hand with an open palm, and whipped into 
both of the robbers. The four-foot hand knocked them ten feet through the air and out of 
the café, skidding another five along the asphalt. Argent steadily followed them outside, 
gazing at the two of them menacingly before her arms were covered in the same silver energy 
before turning into writhing tentacle-like ropes. Flinging her arms outward, they wrapped 
and bound the robbers, constricting them so tight that they dropped their guns while 
straining to breathe through the pain. Drawing them towards her, Argent said coldly, 
"Alright now, I'm leaving you 'ere for the coppers. You say a thing, and it's through a 
wall, understand?"</P><P>They nodded without a word between them, and were left on the 
sidewalk. Argent pulled her cell phone from her pocket and flipped it open. Dialing in for 
the police, she said, "'Ello? I'd like to report a robbery. Yes they're still 'ere- no, 
nobody's in danger, I gave 'em a real twat- no, that's not what I meant. Wot ever, they're 
goin' nowhere, just come here quick and nick 'em, alright?"</P><P>Argent rubbed the bridge 
of her nose as she tried to bear with the policeman on the phone. Sighing deeply from her 
nose she said, "We're at the Starbucks on Fifth and King. Hurry up, I'm not sittin' 'ere 
all day."</P><P>!</P><P>Casual steps through the streets, weaving about the paths of 
others, Jinx made her way down the road, looking for others to steal from. She'd already 
made a killing so far, and could have went home by then. However, something inside 
continued to nag the sorceress to keep up her antics. She didn't understand why, and it was 
making her nervous, but she kept her eyes peeled for any other sucker to make a few dollars 
off of.</P><P>It was only so far down the street that Jinx had encountered a scene that 
piqued her interests: the police parked around a coffee shop, two men tied up with bands of 
silver that glowed, and a rather gothic, yet fashionable girl talking with the officers. 
Pulling her hood further over her face to help obscure her identity, she passed by, 
catching a look at the girl; seeing who it was, it clicked just who was present. Argent. 
Now here was some <I>real</I> fun to be had. In a snap she'd already planned how she'd do 
it, and then she'd let circumstance and Fate take them wherever the wind blew. She smirked 
to herself as she walked towards Argent, using a friendly tone as she said, "Hey. Seems 
luck hasn't been with you lately. Wanna go get a cup of coffee? I'll pay."</P><P>Swinging 
around to the direction of the voice, Argent caught sight of one who looked to be a 
terribly scrawny girl, even moreso than herself. A gray hoodie was pulled over the girl's 
face, and she wore a pair of faded black jeans, ones that somehow were small enough to fit 
her form. "And who might you be, stranger?" she asked, putting a hand on her 
hip.</P><P>Although her eyes weren't visible, Argent could still see the mischievous sneer 
under the hood. She didn't like this girl one jot. "Call me Jay. Everyone does," she 
offered. Her tone reeked of both sophistication and ulterior motive. In spite of her inner 
gut telling her otherwise, Argent agreed out of her curiosity. "Alright, I'll take you up 
on that."</P><P>Heading into the shop, the pair stepped up to the counter, the employees 
still in shock and gibbering to each other. Jinx rapped the counter top smartly, and 
barked, "Hey, lazy slobs! What's with the freakin' wait? Stop pissing yourselves, we want 
some java."</P><P>Only one of them was able to stand and speak at the same time, and so he 
stepped up to the register. His face painted with confusion, he asked shakily, "Uh... 
u-ummm... w-what would you l-like?"</P><P>"I'll take a large iced mocha with five shots of 
espresso and <I>lots</I> of sugar. You?" she said, turning to Argent.</P><P>Argent was 
astounded that this girl could be so casual at the scene, as if nothing had happened, let 
alone order around people who'd just been traumatized. Of course, it <I>was</I> her fault, 
but Argent wasn't about to admit that, and the police had the criminals handled anyway. Now 
that she'd thought about it, Argent made a mental note to refrain from using her powers 
unless the situation really called for it; she was, after all, pretty well-trained when it 
came to defending herself without utilizing her supernatural abilities.</P><P>Suddenly, 
Argent was snapped from her train of thought by Jinx's snapping fingers. "Whaddaya wanna 
get, lady?" she said curtly, waiting to get the other girl's order.</P><P>Argent said to 
the cashier, "I'll have wotever she's having, but cool it a li'l on the 
sugar."</P><P>"Alright..."</P><P>Jinx then held up a credit card that it seemed she'd 
pulled from nowhere between her index and middle fingers, then placed it on the counter. 
The cashier swiped it, and told the hooded girl that she needed to sign the screen below. 
Grabbing the stylus, Jinx made a scrawl on the screen and was given the receipt for their 
order, being informed that their coffee would be done in just a minute or two. Argent was 
somewhat suspicious of just how quickly everything had zipped by, as if the girl had a plan 
for how the entire night was to go and executed it brilliantly.</P><P>As soon as they were 
given their mochas, Jinx gave a loud slurp as she sucked down the majority of her coffee in 
one breath. Her whole body lurched as if she were the Nesquik rabbit gulping down a swig of 
chocolate milk. Once she'd swallowed her drink, Jinx slipped the credit card into Argent's 
pocket and walked away silently, giving her a sign to 'peace-out' as she left.</P><P>For a 
moment, Argent was struck dumb as to why her hooded friend would have handed her a credit 
card. But, as she took a good look at it, she realized it was her own. Shock covered her 
face as it dawned on her what exactly had gone on. Stomping after the girl, she yelled, 
"Bloody 'ell, who d'you think you are? You don't just go and pinch somebody's dough like 
that!"</P><P>The thief twisted around in Argent's direction and lowered her hood, revealing 
Jinx's face and signature Cheshire grin, her smile stretching from ear to ear. Her hair was 
pulled into a ponytail and her eyes sparkled like two coral stars in the night sky. 
Drinking the last of her mocha in one large swig, Jinx raised her empty cup in a 
mock-toast, snidely whispering, "Cheers," before tossing it over her shoulder and bolting 
around the corner.</P><P>The <I>nerve</I>! In a blind effort to catch up with the nimble 
thief, Argent leapt upward, a shimmering aura of silver light outlining her figure as she 
zoomed through the air in hot pursuit.</P><P>!</P><P>She couldn't help her insides cramping 
into knots as she crowed with villainous laughter. They hurt so much, and she hadn't even 
run more than thirty yards, yet she still felt like her stomach was going to turn itself 
inside out while her heart would implode, all at the same time. Continuing her sprint down 
the sidewalk, pushing unaware bystanders to the ground to make sure they could avoid the 
ball of piss, fashion and black pudding that sped behind her, Jinx thrust her hand to the 
side and unleashed a hex that sliced through a light post. It wouldn't have hit any of the 
now frightened populace, but it would certainly provide a distraction for Argent, who would 
almost certainly stop for a moment to 'save' anybody who might get hurt.</P><P>Her plan was 
a success; Argent halted in mid-air, frantically using her power to prevent the post from 
falling. Two silver hands grasped the pole at each end, and with a little bit of obvious 
strain, bent it in half before dropping it in the street. Jinx efficiently utilized those 
precious borrowed seconds to hurtle into the nearest alleyway, gaining distance and 
valuable time between them.</P><P>She wormed her way through the maze-like paths of the 
back alleys, which she knew like the back of her hand. Argent's cries of frustration could 
be heard, telling Jinx that she had enough time to catch some of her breath, or at least 
keep up with it. While slowing her panting, Jinx undid her ponytail and pulled her hair 
into two stiff, generally upright pigtails. They weren't the devil-horns she was accustomed 
to, but the style would suffice for the time being. At least she'd be more recognizable if 
and when Argent caught sight of her, which Jinx wanted- there was something that Jinx 
couldn't place about the situation, but whatever it was, it made the chase 
addictive.</P><P>Only a few moments later, Jinx saw Argent whip around the corner, her face 
twisted with rage as the silver-laced girl's eyes met the pink witch's own. Jinx's crooked 
smirk only irritated Argent further, and it was in a split second that they were both on 
the run again.</P><P>Jinx's feet pattered on the asphalt as she moved her legs as fast as 
she could. In spite of her efforts, Argent still closed the gap between them, steadily but 
surely getting closer and closer. Making a desperate move, Jinx jumped from the ground in 
mid-step and into the nearby wall. She kicked off of that, crossing the alley before 
repeating, and then knifed through the nearest window. The crash of shattering glass rang 
through Argent's ears, and she suddenly feared for the health of anyone who may have been 
in the way of the fierce and dangerous shards. Floating to said window, she growled at the 
sight: Jinx had broken into somebody's absent living room and bolted to the back of the 
house. She could see the thief dash for the main hall of the apartment building, and so she 
spiraled around the brick structure, watching Jinx's progress through the windows, until 
finally they both met at the top, on opposite sides of the roof. They made eye contact, 
Jinx's ever-irritating grin contrasting dramatically with Argent's snarling frown. After 
staring at each other for only a moment, Jinx dashed away, building up speed to leap across 
the alleyway and to the next building. Following just behind her, Argent roared as she 
began to fling fists of silver energy at Jinx, "Get back 'ere so I can kick your arse, 
y'twat!"</P><P>"Ha! You think I'm that stupid?"</P><P>Jinx sped up, almost dancing through 
the air it seemed to the next rooftop. Zooming behind her, Argent continued her futile 
attempts to knock Jinx to the ground, instead hitting the rooftops with crippling force. 
Each blow was either ducked or twirled out of the strike zone. The same pattern continued, 
a merrily laughing thief dancing across the city while another metahuman engaged in a chase 
that seemed it would never end.</P><P>However, Argent got a lucky break; Jinx had cornered 
herself on a building whose surrounding structures were out of reach for any sort of 
bounding. Jinx twisted herself around, catching sight of Argent landing on the rooftop, 
intentionally, purposefully strutting forward with an expression of frustration, 
irritability, and a slight amount of weariness at chasing Jinx throughout the city. Her 
right arm raised slightly from her side, poised to strike with her trademark silver energy. 
"So," Jinx sighed, "I guess it's a little late for apologies, huh?" to which Argent nodded 
silently.</P><P>"Guess I gotta do my last resort."</P><P>In a flash, Jinx made a slide low 
to fling a curse at Argent, which caught her by surprise. The hot pink energy struck her in 
the ankles, and made her fall to the ground as though her knees turned into jelly. 
Springing from her low stance, Jinx tackled Argent to her back. Pinning her by the wrists, 
a sudden thought came to mind; she didn't know whether or not to act on it, but she was 
more than certain that it would serve as an excellent distraction. Jinx leaned her head 
forward and planted a short kiss on Argent's lips. While Jinx's eyes were closed for that 
moment, Argent's went wide open. Her brain was in a state of shock, and Jinx took advantage 
of the moment it bought her, hopping to her feet and waving at Argent, teasing, "See ya 
later," blowing a kiss to the stunned heroine. Her escape was already imminent by the time 
Argent recovered, enough to let the witch get away. Seeing the pink-haired trickster make 
her way from the scene, Argent lightly touched her lips. They continued to tingle, and 
Argent's heartbeat was racing. What... <I>what</I> had just happened? '<I>You were just 
kissed by another girl, you git,</I>' her conscience lashed out at her, '<I>and you</I> 
liked <I>it</I>.'</P><P>Her fingertips lingered around her lipstick-glossed mouth for a few 
seconds longer before she dropped her hand to her side. "Wot a night... I think I'll hit 
the hay to think 'bout this for a spell..." she mumbled to herself before flying away, many 
thoughts plaguing her mind.</P><P>!</P><P>As soon as Jinx was certain that she was out of 
harm's way, she stopped to put a hand over her heart, thudding inside her chest like some 
sort of bass drum. She was aware that the chase was supposed to be enjoyed, but the kiss? 
Something that surprised her was how much she relished the oral contact, and she supposed 
that it was partly the reason her heart pounded under her ribs the way it did. It was 
rightly unnerving, because she also knew that she was never this weary after a good 
run.</P><P>Tired? More like the adrenaline was simply taking its leave, and her knees had 
been slathered with axle grease. Her body was shaking in its entirety, the shivers 
particularly abusive to her spine. A deep sigh and she stopped panting. although the head 
rush that accompanied it took a few moments longer to ebb away. Once she felt that she 
could actually step without falling over, Jinx steadily walked to the apartment she shared 
with Mammoth and Gizmo. Kyd Wykkyd was there as well, but it seemed that Seemore and Billy 
Numerous were elsewhere.</P><P>Looking up from the television, Mammoth raised a brow. 
"Where you been?" he grumbled.</P><P>"Oh... just pinching things here and there. Got enough 
to feed us for a week on pizza," she replied. Reaching into her pockets, she grabbed a 
fistful of dollars, many of them tens and twenties. "Alright, now we'll be able to pay off 
the rent with what I nabbed. Good thing we managed to get the place so cheap, 
eh?"</P><P>Jinx made a crooked smile with one side of her lips. "Yeah..."</P><P>Kyd 
Wykkyd's routine apathetic expression was replaced with a look that clearly displayed 
concern. Jinx read it, and said, "Nothing's wrong. All that happened was I landed us some 
dough," but it was obvious to him that she was lying. His scarlet eyes narrowed, but he let 
her go. For now.</P><P>As Jinx slapped the money on the dinner table, she watched the 
others dive for it hungrily, avariciously, like a pack of wild dogs on a fresh kill. She 
made a quiet huff as she strode into her room.</P><P>Flopping her tired self onto a soft, 
almost squishy bed, she heaved a lengthy breath that seemed to carry away all of her 
exasperation, towing it in its wake. So... why did she do that again? She expected it to 
shock Argent's wits right out of her, but didn't anticipate it biting her in the ass. The 
more she thought about it, it simply became clearer and clearer until it was like looking 
through a window made of crystal: <I>she had a crush on Argent</I>. Such an epiphany, to 
realize she was in love with another woman. Her heart skipped a beat, and the tingling that 
ran along every nerve in her body was back with a vengeance.</P><P>Rolling to her side, 
Jinx gripped her overstuffed pillow, wrapping all of her limbs around it in a fetal 
position, as though she was desperately clinging to a loved one. She held her position, the 
only thing signaling life being how her ribcage inflated and deflated until the next 
morning.</P><P>!</P><P>Dawn was intrusive, the warm rays of the rising sun bathing Argent 
with their warmth. Giving a yawn and a mumble of a few choice words, she turned away from 
the window and curled deeper into her sheets and blankets. The sunlight remained 
persistent, and assaulted her back. The blankets did nothing to help, simply making it 
uncomfortably hot underneath the quilts. Growling in frustration, Argent submitted and 
unceremoniously rolled from bed. Her eyes reluctantly gazed at the clock, slightly hesitant 
to know how much of the day she was about to waste not sleeping. Six forty-one in the 
morning.</P><P>Argent tossed her hands to the air, irritation only growing and giving no 
signs of slowing down, let alone stopping altogether. Now she was the one who had to make 
the coffee for the man and maid-servants. The head butler was especially particular about 
how he wanted his coffee; medium roast, two scoops of grounds with every seven cups, and 
precisely two lumps of sugar per teacup. With just how exact she did everything, one would 
think her part of the staff as well, but such was not the case. The rest of them were all 
so busy with the upkeep of the estate, among other goings-on that mostly included the 
outrageous credit card bills that Argent had racked up. Once, she swore that she'd caught 
ear of the head honcho mumbling to himself that the girl would be the death of all of 
them.</P><P>Well, the family's finances, at least. Just because they had a lot of money 
didn't mean that it was endless. As much as she hated to admit it, Argent did so 
begrudgingly, that she at least owed them some coffee in the morning for all of the 
bullshit they dealt with every day. Stretching in a manner not unlike a cat, Argent trudged 
downstairs once she felt that everything had popped back into place. Shed had to rub her 
eyes a little from the brightness of the golden sun pouring in just over the window sill 
and flooding the family kitchen with pale yellow light. Her eyes still having yet to adjust 
to the sunshine and glare of the morning, she had already started up the coffeepot when she 
swore that she'd caught glimpse of someone running through their yard. She knew that it 
wasn't just some kids playing around on the property- Mount Davidson was far too 
upper-class for such ruffians. The only other explanations she could possibly think of were 
either a guest had arrived too early for his own good, or...</P><P>Or...</P><P>Argent 
gasped. They were being <I>robbed</I>! No way was she going to let someone even 
<I>think</I> they could get away with such a crime. She was much too proud for something 
like that.</P><P>!</P><P>Jinx hadn't been able to get a wink of sleep since the nervousness 
wracked her with insomnia. Four thirty in the morning, and not a lick of slumber. She was 
well aware of what was keeping her from being able to get some shut-eye, and it was Argent. 
Her mind continued to ponder just how badly Argent had taken it, whether she would be 
angry, disgusted, pleased, or worst of all, confused. Anything else and it was easy enough 
to guess what would come of them meeting again, but being unsure of what happened and how 
she should feel about it was what scared Jinx the most. After all, many people were the 
most dangerous when they had no idea of what was the right thing to do in a 
situation.</P><P>In spite of these fears, and rightly so that she harbored them, Jinx could 
not control that insatiable urge welling up from deep inside and overpowering her caution 
and intuition in all of their forms. And so, at that, the metahuman thief gathered a dark 
hoodie and pants, hiding her features as she briskly snaked from one end of Jump City to 
the other, setting foot on the base of the land where the difference between 'rich' and 
'wealthy' was made very distinct. Servants could have servants of their own; Hell, for all 
she knew, there was probably some sort of feudal system in each individual house, if you 
could even call it a house anymore. There was no way that one family of four could use that 
much living space, and what she knew about Argent led her to believe that Argent was an 
only child. Dear Lord, the place had to have about three personal servants per member of 
the family just to be able to utilize the extra room that would otherwise go to 
waste.</P><P>As she made her hike up the hill's roads, Jinx thought of what it would be 
like if she and the rest of the H.I.V.E. Five were to move into a place that big. Even with 
how much each of them would demand in terms of personal space, they wouldn't be able to use 
it all unless they had Mammoth and Gizmo plow out and reinforce most, if not all, of the 
lower floor to turn it into a practice area. She shook her head at the thought. There were 
some who simply weren't made for something so lavish and decadent, and she was among them. 
How Argent managed was beyond her comprehension. Sure, Jinx could appreciate big places, 
but that was only because inside, there was usually either money or something else that was 
highly valuable.</P><P>In the stretch of time that seemed only a short while, Jinx had 
found herself standing at the front gates of what was supposed to be Argent's place. A 
pause to take a look at her watch, and she was just past five thirty, five thirty-six to be 
exact. At least she had time to make a bit of a scouting about the property and come up 
with a plan to get to see Argent without being noticed by anybody else. With a flick of her 
wrist, an arc of cursed- or was it cursing? She didn't care anyway- energy leaped from her 
hand and to the security device at the gates, which then slowly opened. She didn't know 
whether or not to take how they creaked out of the unwanted guest's path as a good thing. 
It could be that they were simply inanimate objects that were doing their job until she 
came along. But with all of the cynicism that came to mind at what exactly they could be, 
the darker part of Jinx's mind warned her that the gates really had a spirit of their own, 
one that was enticing her to come in. <I>Come, little one, come to meet your doom</I>, she 
imagined. Shaking her head in an attempt to wipe the thoughts away, Jinx swore to herself 
at how paranoid she had become. All because she wanted to talk about something in private. 
What a life.</P><P>Taking note of the surrounding area, Jinx slunk through the shrubs and 
trees, unseen by the caretakers that were wandering about the place to do their jobs early 
in the morning. In fact, even getting up to what she assumed was Argent's window was easy. 
It took her exactly one leap and two swings to reach the trim and gutter that was under the 
window. Peering through the glass brought only disappointment, as she saw that Argent 
wasn't there. Looking at her watch, she saw how much time had passed: it was about six 
thirty, just a few minutes until six forty. How long had she been walking around the 
property? She had no idea, but she did know that they had an enormous estate. She winced at 
how inefficiently she was using her time, and dropped to hang off of the gutter before 
plummeting to the ground. She landed in a crouch, absorbing the impact, before darting into 
the neaest bunch of bushes.</P><P>Now came the time to wonder about how she would be able 
to find Argent. Would she be in the bathroom, taking a shower, or-</P><P>Jinx's mind 
wandered back to the shower. Argent, soaking herself and turning pink from the water's 
temperature, slathering the soapy suds of body wash all over. After rinsing off, she 
stepped out, and the only thing that provided any sort of censorship was the heavy steam 
that swirled about her. Then those eyes, those beautiful, dark eyes, looked straight in her 
direction...</P><P>And Jinx then realized that she'd stepped from her cover as her mind 
wandered into her fantasy. Looking at the French doors that led into the kitchen, she did 
see Argent's eyes, but they weren't exactly pleasant either. A tired, irritable gaze was 
locked onto what figure the sleepy one could catch through the panes of glass between 
herself and the intruder.</P><P>Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh HolylordJesusChristinheaven,<I> 
shit</I>! Jinx hauled ass through the yard, hearing a door slam behind her. Argent was hot 
on her tail, and she knew it as soon as she made the corner. This time, she'd gone too far, 
and was going to pay dearly for it.</P><P>Argent rounded the turn herself, shooting through 
the air like a silver bullet. She was going to beat this one into the ground, and then save 
them for the police. Argent imagined that she'd enjoy it very much.</P><P>Finally, Jinx 
found herself trapped. <I>Again</I>. The iron spike fence loomed in front of her, impeding 
her escape. Before she had the time to fling a hex at it, she felt Argent spear her in the 
back, tackling her to the ground. Winded, Jinx was rolled over by a very firm grip, and 
looked up to see Argent wearing a wildly furious expression. In one instant, Argent's eyes 
went from murder to shock, realization slapping her in the face at who she was about to 
beat to a pulp. Fearful, coral orbs met her own, and Argent released her hold over Jinx's 
shoulders, although she still sat over her torso, effectively pinning her to the ground. 
"Bloody Hell... Wot d'you think you're doing here?" Argent demanded, her face now reading 
more confusion than anything else.</P><P>Jinx's breathing was still heavy and shallow, and 
having Argent on top of her didn't help in the slightest. Propping herself up on her 
elbows, she panted, "I just wanna talk, is all."</P><P>"Talk?" Argent repeated, "Talk? At 
six thirty in the morning? Are you <I>mad</I>?"</P><P>Grinning sheepishly, Jinx answered, 
"Well, I got a diagnosis this one time-"</P><P>"Shut it. That was rhetorical."</P><P>The 
two stared at one another for a few awkward moments before Argent sighed tiredly. Putting a 
hand to her forehead, she asked with a voice that hinted at the sleepiness coming back in 
all its former glory, "Want t'come inside? I think I need to have a sit. I've got some 
coffee brewin' if you need a wake up call yourself," getting off of Jinx's hips. Although 
Argent remained standing over her, Jinx managed to slide out from under her and stood 
herself. "Yeah. Sounds nice."</P><P>!</P><P>Although the back of her jeans and her hoodie 
were a little damp from the dewey grass, Jinx had taken seat at a middle island in the 
kitchen that Argent had the coffee brewing. Getting a mug for the both of them, Argent 
asked, "how d'you like your brew? Cream 'n sugar, heavy on the second one?" Jinx nodded 
with a confirming grunt.</P><P>Fixing Jinx's first and then her own, Argent brought the 
drinks to the island and sat across from the girl with apparently a wide array of 
infiltration abilities. '<I>No wonder, really,</I>' Argent thought to herself, "<I>She 
</I>is<I> a thief, after all.</I>' "So, wot did you think was so important that you had to 
wake me up so bloody early?"</P><P>Jinx's grip around the ceramic mug tightened 
considerably. It seemed she was reluctant to talk, but she managed to wrench the words from 
her mouth anyway. "Well... I wanted to talk about last night."</P><P>A "Hm," signalled for 
Jinx to continue. "First off, I wanna apologize about stealing your credit card and setting 
you off like that." Argent merely waved it off.</P><P>"No harm, really. I'm sure that you 
can see that something that small isn't goin to hurt anything. It was all on principle, the 
chasing. That, and the fact that you broke into some chap's house just to keep running. 
That <I>really </I>got my blood boiling somethin' fierce, it did."</P><P>Argent took a sip 
of her coffee while Jinx looked away a little shamefully, "Yeah, that's a bit much there." 
Turning back to Argent, she continued, "Then there's what... <I>happened</I> on the 
rooftop," her cheeks getting slightly pink before saying, "It was the first thing I could 
think of that would've let me get outta there. Wasn't the smartest thing I've 
done."</P><P>"I reckon that's already been established."</P><P>"Well, I think it's kinda 
affected us. I dunno if you got it too, but it got my heart beating a little to fast for 
the feeling to not mean something."</P><P>This time, it was Argent's turn to blush, 
although hers was much more pronounced. "Ah... well... wot I mean to say is..." She tried 
her damnedest, but couldn't spit it out.</P><P>Jinx cracked a rather small grin. "So you 
got a little excited yourself, huh?" she said, to which Argent could only nod. "At least 
the feeling's mutual," she finished before taking a swig of her own coffee.</P><P>The rest 
of their morning brew was silent for the most part. They'd each gotten down two and were 
working on their third when the head butler strode into the kitchen, only to find the 
coffeepot empty. Looking about the kitchen, he saw the two culprits, sipping away at their 
cups. He snorted, and turned to make it again on his own. It was when they heard the faucet 
running that he'd even caught their attention, and they turned towards him. "Morning," Jinx 
said in his direction.</P><P>He turned around as soon as he'd dumped the water into the 
machine's container. "Good day, madam," he replied courteously. "And who, may I ask you 
Madam Monetti, is our guest at such a peculiar hour?"</P><P>Argent coughed lightly before 
answering, "She's a friend of mine. I'd told her to visit at seven, but I think she's 
addled wot I meant." The butler nodded curtly before returning to the coffee, scooping in 
his preferred amount of grounds.</P><P>Jinx leaned forward and asked, "If your last name's 
Italian, what's with the accent?"</P><P>"Dad's a senator from New Jersey, mum's the English 
one."</P><P>"Ah. That explains a lot." Reclining in her seat, she took the last of her warm 
coffee in a couple swallows, and Argent followed suit. "Think we should head somewhere a 
little more private? I'm not a fan of people listening in on conversations," Jinx wondered 
aloud.</P><P>Argent took both of their cups and placed them gently into the sink before 
jerking her head to the stairs. "C'mon, I'll take you to my room."</P><P>Jinx followed, and 
after walking up three flights of stairs, Argent opened the door to her room and beckoned 
Jinx inside.</P><P>The room was magnificent; a bed that had to be a California king, 
complete with drapery about it. The blankets were a dark maroon, almost black cherry, and 
ebony silk hung lazily from the canopy. The carpet was a tad lighter than the blankets, and 
the walls were a cool, dark grey. In spite of how extravagant the room looked, there were 
still a few things that made it look more like home, such as the posters that took up 
nearly all of the wall space. They were decorated with all of Argent's favorite musicians, 
covering everything from metal to classic rock to pop and electronica. There were a few 
industrial bands as well, ones that Jinx recognized easily. Being a fan of the various 
genres herself made it much easier to know who was who. The wardrobe was open and displayed 
fashionable yet grim looking clothes. Studded belts hung next to bare midriff t-shirts, 
which in turn were next to many skirts and then jackets, some of them made of leather or 
gator skin. Jinx whistled, marvelling and envying at the majestic room.</P><P>"It's wot I 
get for having a rich father," Argent said, knowing that Jinx was gawking at the whole of 
the place, trying to take it all in.</P><P>Taking a seat at the end of the bed, Argent 
broke Jinx's hypnotised staring with, "Well, I'd say it's time to chat, eh?" Jinx snapped 
her head in Argent's direction before sitting next to her on the bed. It was quite 
comfortable.</P><P>Leaning back on her hands, Jinx said, "Um... I'm pretty sure that we... 
<I>like</I> each other. Y'know, <I>like</I> like."</P><P>"Mmhmm."</P><P>"Doesn't it bother 
you? I mean, I'm a freakin' ghetto thief, you're the rich type that chases guys like me 
down. You've got publicity, an image to keep up. I'm not against the idea of us bein' 
together, I kinda swing like that. But you, the paparazzi's gonna be <I>all over</I> your 
ass if anybody finds out." Her voice expressed genuine worry at the situation.</P><P>Argent 
sighed. "Yeah, I know." She looked into Jinx's beautiful, flamingo pink eyes for a moment, 
and Jinx gazed in return at her shimmering gray eyes. They were so light that they almost 
looked like mercury.</P><P>"But it'd be worth it. You're just about the only girl I've ever 
fancied like this. In spite of last night, I think something clicked, y'now?"</P><P>At 
that, Argent rolled over and pinned Jinx to the bed, their hands entwined together as 
Argent slung her legs over Jinx's hips. The black-haired heroine then planted a kiss on 
Jinx's lips, drawing it out over the next several seconds. As she opened her eyes again, 
Jinx could see that they were misty, and she bit her lip before they locked their mouths 
together, this time letting their tongues slither in each other's mouths like moist eels. 
She could feel Argent's slightly glossed lips sticking to her own, and after what felt like 
ages, the both of them finally came up for air. "How's about we get you all the way on the 
bed, hm?" Argent said suggestively, and then scooted Jinx all the way onto the pillowy 
mattress.</P><P>Jinx said nothing, as she was moved up to the pillows. She watched as 
Argent stepped down to the edge of the bed, and gently dropped her pajama bottoms, leaving 
her in nothing but panties and a fairly insubstantial night shirt. Jinx kicked her shoes to 
the other side of the room before sliding her jeans to her knees, where she also let them 
drop off. She unzipped her hoodie and flung it off the side of the bed, leaving her as 
undressed as Argent. They then proceeded to hold one another intimately kissing all over 
each other passionately and crossing their legs in an embrace of their own. Argent's 
slender hand found its way up Jinx's shirt and massaged her somewhat flat chest, rolling 
her thumb over Jinx's now perked nipples. Jinx gasped, and replied by letting her own bony 
fingers trail down Argent's back and into the seat of her panties, grasping a handful of 
Argent's buttock. Argent made a pleasurable moan, and they continued to grope each other 
ever fiercer as the morning began to pass.</P><P>!</P><P>It was high noon by the time 
either of the two had recovered enough to say anything, entangled in both the sheets and 
each other. It was Jinx. "You're so beautiful," she whispered, stroking Argent's face. Her 
own hair had been undone, and was a mess of frizz and wispiness.</P><P>Argent opened her 
eyes and smiled. "We can't let anybody find out about this, y'know," Jinx informed her 
partner softly.</P><P>Simply kissing Jinx's forehead, she put her hands over the witch's 
shoulders and held their naked bodies closer. "I know. That's why I'm not letting you 
leave."</P><P>Jinx expressed her confusion with a raised brow. "... What?"</P><P>Argent the 
sat up, keeping the blankets over her. "I love you, Jay. I'm not letting you go back to the 
streets, pinching other people's dough just to get by. I won't have it."</P><P>Jinx sat up 
in the same position as her lover. Was she understanding correctly? Did Argent actually 
want them to be together like that, living in her house? She shook her head at the thought. 
"I... I can't. I got friends who depend on me, who need me. I'm not gonna leave them behind 
like that. I can still love you, but I can't just ditch 'em," she explained.</P><P>Tears 
welled up in the eyes of them both, Argent's running down her face first. "Well," Argent's 
voice cracking as she attempted to hold back the sobs, "what's that mean? We can't be 
together?"</P><P>Jinx wrapped her arms around Argent's shoulders, choking up herself as she 
said, "No, we can still love each other like this, but I can't leave my friends in the 
dust. I'll visit every day, make sure that everything's fine, always tell you I love you. 
But I owe it to them to keep them together, they're not gonna go for long without tearing 
each other to pieces. I'm the one thing that keeps 'em in check, and can make sure that we 
don't get thrown in jail."</P><P>Argent hung her head as they broke the hug. "So... this 
isn't the end?"</P><P>"No, it's not. We can still love each other, I won't let this crap 
get in the way. I just can't live with you is all."</P><P>Their puffy eyes met, and they 
leaped into each others arms, giving one last kiss before Jinx got out of bed. Putting on 
her clothes and pulling her hair into pigtails, she looked at Argent as she wiped the tears 
away. "I guess I'll see you later then, huh?"</P><P>Argent silently nodded before lying 
back down. "Um... I'll show myself out. See ya."</P><P>Argent kissed the tips of her index 
and middle fingers and held them outward, Jinx doing the same and touching them together. 
"See ya," Argent said as Jinx walked out the door, pausing to nod as she closed the 
door.</P>
