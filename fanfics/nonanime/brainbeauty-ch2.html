But then, Daria wasn&#39;t the only one with nightmares--so was Sandi.

Right now, the brunette had long since dozed off, when she dreamt that 
she was in one of the hallways of Lawndale High, when Quinn, Jane, 
Stacy, Tiffany, Jodie, Mack, Brittany, Kevin, the 3 J&#39;s, and the 
cheerleaders were teasing her with, &quot;Sandi and Daria, up in a tree, 
K-I-double-S-I-N-G,&quot; before following it with raucous laughter.

&quot;Stop it, all of you!!&quot; protested Sandi. &quot;Before I kick your sorry butts 
after school!!&quot;

&quot;Sandi&#39;s got a girlfriend, Sandi&#39;s got a girlfriend,&quot; chirped Brittany 
in a sing song way.

&quot;Scram, Ms. Eepmeister!!&quot; roared the brunette. &quot;I ain&#39;t got no &amp;^$*%@# 
girlfriend!!&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes you do,&quot; said the cheerleader, using a baby voice. &quot; and her 
name&#39;s Daria, oh, she&#39;s CU---------TE!!&quot;

Jumping up and down in a rage, Sandi stated, &quot;You&#39;re all cuckoo!! Just 
because I kissed a geeky, brainy unpopular girl just to win a bet, that 
don&#39;t mean I love her!!&quot;

I need a unit to sample and hold
but not the angry one
a new design, new design.

I need a unit to sample and hold
but not the lonely one
a new design, new design.

I need a unit to sample and hold
but not the lonely one

Sample and hold.

That was when Daria arrived on the scene, and said, &quot;Hey Sandi.&quot;

Turning to the auburn cynic, the brunette said, &quot;Hello, precious.&quot;

From there, she went to Daria, and the two held each other while they 
kissed.

&quot;Whoo-hoo, go Daria and Sandi!!&quot; cheered Jane.

That was when the crowd chanted, &quot;Sandi loves Daria!! Sandi loves 
Daria!!&quot; 

Bolting upright on her bed, Sandi shrieked, &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!&quot;

It was night, with the sweat on her face.........and something sticky on 
her fingers. Upon glancing down, the brunette saw that her left hand had 
been in her vagina, which meant she had been masturbating in her sleep. 
Worst still, her top had been off and she had been using her right hand 
to play with her breasts. No. Had she been playing with herself? And if 
so, to what or whom? Was it the dream? Was it Daria? Her? Impossible!! 
That bespecticled auburn haired geeky brain was the last girl she&#39;d be 
in love with, much less kiss.

That kiss. It all started with that kiss.......all on account of that 
stupid bet.

Well, that, along with her prideful bragging boasting ways, which she 
had been brought up, by special arrangement from her mother, Linda. All 
because of her bragging that she&#39;d kiss the first girl, the troubles 
began. Why didn&#39;t she challenge Quinn, Tiffany or Stacy to kiss her to 
win the bet? Why Daria? True, Sandi had read of the stories of how the 
teen girls of camp and of high school would take such a dare similar to 
what she had gone through--and did just that--in Waif. Even so, since 
that kiss, the brunette hadn&#39;t been able to get the memory out of her 
mind. That was when the fact came to her out of the black------Sandi 
Griffin was a lesbian. In fact, since she was born, she had liked girls. 
But it wasn&#39;t until when she first enrolled into Lawndale High, when she 
first formed The Fashion Club and when Daria and Quinn first came to 
Lawndale, that her love for girls came of age. Which made her that part 
of the 48% per capita of Lawndale&#39;s teen girl population.

Heading to the bathroom to wash her hand, Sandi pondered those 
discoveries--and wondered. But there was still a lot of blame to place 
on--Quinn, Stacy and Tiffany for egging her on and prompting her to make 
that bet, Daria for arriving at the worst place at the worst time and 
her mother Linda for making her an egotist and a pawn, just for her own 
gains in competing against Helen Morgendorffer, along with herself for 
allowing her boastfulness to get the worst of her. At one point, the 
brunette could imagine a livid Helen shout at her with, &quot;You %@#*$&amp;^ 
lesbian!! You&#39;ve ruined my daughter!!&quot; Now THAT was something to 
compound the Morgendorffer/Griffin war even worse. 

Scowling in the mirror, Sandi muttered, &quot;Hang you, Quinn. Hang you, 
Stacy and Tiffany. Hang you, Mom. Hang me, for that matter. And hang you 
too, Daria.......&quot;

Daria.......

But if she hated kissing a brain, then why had she liked kissing Daria? 
Maybe because it WAS her first kiss, even from another girl.

And if the auburn hated kissing another girl, much less a popular and 
shallow one, why did she kiss back? Was Daria secretly a lesbian in 
spite of her relationship with Tom Sloane and didn&#39;t know it? Was she 
bi? For someone that kissed back, Daria kept her feelings hidden 
afterwards.

That wasn&#39;t all--when Daria pulled her close, Sandi felt the cynic&#39;s 
breasts brush along hers, and she swore that she felt her nipples were 
erect, which meant that within that green coat, orange blouse and black 
pleated skirt, was a body that had potential. If that was the 
case.......what WAS Daria&#39;s body like?

But, most important of all: was the brunette falling in love with the 
auburn cynic? Even attracted to her? Romanticlly? Sexually? All of the 
above? No. Impossible!! There was no way, in any shape and/or form that 
was likely!! 

Or WAS it........?

Troubled by all these, Sandi could only stare in the mirror in 
frustration.

Daria staggered in her sleepwear to the kitchen where Helen, in her 
blazer and skirt, was checking out her papers for her latest case. 
Glancing up at her daughter, Helen stated, &quot;Is something bothering you, 
Daria? Seems like you didn&#39;t get much sleep last night.&quot;

&quot;How could I?&quot; said the auburn. &quot;Sandi&#39;s been trying to kiss me in my 
dreams.&quot;

&quot;Sandi? As in Sandi Griffin, the head of The Fashion Club?&quot;

&quot;The same. I didn&#39;t think a stuck up and shallow girl like her had the 
hots for me.&quot;

Suddenly what Daria heard next wasn&#39;t Helen&#39;s voice--but Sandi&#39;s: &quot;Poor 
sweetie.....&quot;

Upon turning around, she could see, Sandi dressed up like Helen, holding 
her arms out to her and crooning, &quot;Come to mommy....&quot; 

And that was when the auburn bolted up from her bed, waking up from such 
a bizarre nightmare. But even worse, was the fact that, as with Sandi, 
Daria had been masturbating and playing with her breasts and nipples, 
her vagina gushing out juice. And already she could see a lot of 
consulting with Jane waiting for her. 

An irate Anthony De Martino had finished collecting test papers from his 
students after they had finished completing the questions on each of the 
papers. Right now, he checked out the first one before approaching 
Sandi, ranting on her with, &quot;Sandi, I admire your well done WORK on your 
test, but there&#39;s only TWO details I should point OUT to you--for 
instance, in question 78, the ANSWER to &#39;who were the Presidents on 
MOUNT Rushmore?&#39; is Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Roosevelt----but 
YOU wrote &#39;Moe, Larry, Curly and SHEMP!!&#39; And in question 87, the RIGHT 
answer to &#39;WHAT did Julius Caesar SAY when Brutus stabbed him?&#39; IS &#39;Et 
tu, Brute?&#39;, NOT &#39;Ouch, that HURTS!!&#39; What&#39;s HAPPENED to you?!?&quot;

Her head hanging, Sandi muttered, &quot;Oop....&quot; 

Inside the cafeteria section, The Fashion Club were having their fare of 
salads and diet soda, but the fact that their brunette leader had nearly 
botched up on her test had them worried.

&quot;Flunking a few of the tests?&quot; said Stacy. &quot;That ain&#39;t like you, Sandi.&quot;

&quot;So what else is new?&quot; said Sandi. &quot;Anyone can have an few mistakes now 
and then, so what&#39;s the big deal?&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;ve always had a perfect track record when it comes to 
schoolwork,&quot; said Quinn. 

&quot;Something&#39;s not right,&quot; said Tiffany. &quot;Lately you&#39;ve been somber and 
troubled since you kissed Quinn&#39;s sister.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s with you all?&quot; charged the brunette. &quot;Like, I don&#39;t see a 
Fashion Club, I see a kangaroo court. Anyone can have their share of 
mood swings now and then.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re just concerned,&quot; said Quinn. &quot;You&#39;re my best friend, and I care 
for you so much.&quot;

&quot;And I care for you too. Right now, I am trying to deal with my state of 
mind, and hopefully I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Turning to Tiffany, the brunette 
said, &quot;Tiffany, can you meet with me in the bathroom after lunch? I&#39;d 
like your opinion on mascara.&quot;

&quot;OK....&quot; drawled Tiffany.

Turning to Stacy and Quinn, Sandi said, &quot;Stacy, you and Quinn meet me 
and Tiffany for fashion coordination check before the last few classes 
after lunch, ok?&quot;

Reluctantly Stacy sighed, &quot;OK. We hope you&#39;re getting better.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll meet you there then?&quot; said Quinn.

&quot;Yup,&quot; muttered the brunette.

After lunch, Sandi and Tiffany entered the bathroom and that was when 
the Asian drawler asked, &quot;So what types of mascara did you bring?&quot;

Glancing left and right, the brunette paused before saying, &quot;The same as 
before.......I said that to get you here, because you&#39;re the only one I 
can trust outside of Quinn, for if she found out, it would break her 
heart. As a yesperson in The Fashion Club, you trust me.&quot;

&quot;Uh.......I don&#39;t follow you.....&quot;

Hanging her head in shame, Sandi spoke up somberly with, &quot;Like, I got a 
confession to make........for all my life, I am a lesbian, a bi that 
loves girls.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve GOT to be joking....&quot; said a shocked Tiffany.

&quot;It&#39;s.......NO JOKE. For I don&#39;t know how long, I felt that way. When 
Quinn and her sister first came to Lawndale........Quinn was SO 
gorgeous......but her sister, for her geeky glasses wearing looks, was 
no slouch--that is, if she&#39;d do something with her looks. When Quinn 
joined the club, I was in seventh heaven.&quot; 

&quot;Brr. You mean you were a lesbian the whole time, and we didn&#39;t know 
that?&quot;

&quot;Mmmmm-hmm. It wasn&#39;t until that article in Waif inspired me to call you 
all together to see if any of you might be like me.......&quot; 

But as fate would have it, the ventilation air duct system from the 
bathroom led to the exhaust stacks located on the roof of the Lawndale 
High building where right now, Kevin and Brittany were kissing big time 
nearby--and that was when the blonde bimbo heard Tiffany say: &quot;So you 
DID think Stacy, Quinn and I were lesbians.......brr.&quot;

Breaking off the kiss, Brittany hissed, &quot;Sst!! Kevvy....!!&quot;

&quot;What babe?&quot; said the quarterback.

&quot;Listen......!!&quot; From there, the cheerleader and Kevin crawled to the 
nearby duct just as Sandi spoke: &quot;Yup.......and then Daria had to step 
in right after I said I&#39;d kiss the first girl that came in here.&quot;

&quot;After all, you brought it on yourself.&quot;

&quot;Since then,&quot; said the brunette, &quot;I started having nightmares, along 
with strange feelings....for Quinn&#39;s sister.......the fact that she, of 
all people, was my first kiss, I couldn&#39;t get her and the day we 
kissed--along with the fact that I enjoyed it-- out of my mind.&quot;

&quot;No wonder you nearly goofed up on those tests,&quot; said the drawler.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t until, like, just now at the cafeteria, that I came to a 
conclusion that I didn&#39;t think would happen to me, nor want at all, not 
in my lifetime......Tiffany.... I think I am falling in love with 
Daria......!!&quot;

Upon hearing that, Kevin blurted out, &quot;HOLY DOG POO!!&quot; 

Brittany on the other hand, fell on her back and was laughing her head 
off.

&quot;You......?&quot; said Tiffany. &quot;In love with Quinn&#39;s sister? That geeky 
brain? You&#39;ve GOT to be joking. Daria, ew. &quot;

&quot;Like,&quot; said the brunette, &quot;it&#39;s no joke. And I know she must be one 
herself, hidden beneath that cynical shell she&#39;s got, with a body to 
match....!! Oh, Tiffany, I&#39;ve gone cuckoo....!!&quot;

&quot;No.......I think you&#39;ve got it bad.........you&#39;re in love,&quot; said the 
Asian. &quot;And it&#39;s S-O wrong.....&quot;

&quot;Anyhow.....what I just said is a secret between me and you. 
Understood?&quot;

&quot;Understood. Safe and sound, safe as milk.&quot;

&quot;Whatever. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

From there, the sound of footsteps could be heard, indicating that Sandi 
and Tiffany had departed. From there, Kevin muttered, &quot;That sucks,&quot; 
before he turned to a guffawing Brittany who was on her knees.

&quot;Babe!!&quot; said the quarterback in disbelief. &quot;That ain&#39;t funny!!&quot;

&quot;Like hell it ain&#39;t!!&quot; giggled the cheerleader. &quot;Sandi Griffin, the 
President of The Fashion Club, in love with Little Miss Muffet Daria?!? 
Gimme a break!!&quot;

&quot;But you heard it, an&#39; I heard it.......an&#39; we STILL don&#39;t believe 
it......!!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d best believe it, or not, Kevvy--just like Ripley. Poor 
Daria......y-you don&#39;t think she could be in love with Sandi.....?&quot;

&quot;Sandi and Daria in love.......&quot; muttered Kevin. &quot;Now THAT is what I&#39;d 
call THE oddest couple in Lawndale. I betcha Upchuck must be blubberin&#39; 
&#39;bout that.&quot;

&quot;Wow....&quot; said Brittany. &quot;If Tom Sloane learned of that, he&#39;d be 
furious.&quot;

&quot;An&#39; if Quinn learned of that, she&#39;d kick their butts.&quot;

&quot;Amen, Kevvy.&quot;

Somewhere, later in the day, near one of the busiest twin main line 
railroad tracks in Lawndale, Daria and Jane were walking alongside them, 
till they reached the double track railroad tunnel known as, according 
to its engraved writing on the concreate portal above: R. R. TUNNEL NO. 
558.

&quot;You nuts, Jane?&quot; said Daria, a hint of surprise. &quot;That is a dangerous, 
if not a restricted place.&quot;

&quot;Why do you think we&#39;re trying to do what we got to do, quick like a 
bunny, and hightail it out of here?&quot; said the artist with a grin.

&quot;Just why&#39;d you bring me here?&quot;

&quot;Did you see the film version of Pink Floyd&#39;s The Wall?&quot;

&quot;As in the one starring Bob Geldof of The Boomtown Rats?&quot;

&quot;The same,&quot; said Jane. &quot;In the film, the child Pink places a bullet--&quot; 
here, Jane produced an unmarked .357 Magnum bullet from her pocket, 
&quot;--on one of the rails of a railroad track before the oncoming train 
runs over it, setting it off.&quot;

Shaking her head, the auburn said, &quot;Where&#39;d you get that bullet?!?&quot;

&quot;When my sister Penny came from Colombia for one of our family reunions, 
she brought with her some of her unmarked bullets and weapons; somehow, 
she forgot one of these bullets here.&quot; Holding up the bullet, the artist 
entered the tunnel till she stopped twelve feet inside.

&quot;Jane!!&quot; said a shocked Daria who had followed her. &quot;Come out of 
there!!&quot;

&quot;Just a moment.&quot; Crouching near the right hand tracks, Jane carefully 
placed the bullet on one of the rails. From there, she said, &quot;OK, let&#39;s 
go.&quot;

Just then, Quinn&#39;s voice could be heard: &quot;Daria!! Jane!!&quot; 

&quot;Now what?&quot; muttered the auburn.

Daria&#39;s redhead sister entered and ran up to them. &quot;What&#39;re you two 
doin&#39; here?!?&quot; she hissed. 

&quot;I was intent on asking you that.&quot; said Daria.

&quot;I saw you and Jane head that way. Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s dangerous in 
here? Anyhow, Daria.......I meant to tell you......if it&#39;s any 
consolatation to you, it&#39;s mine, Tiffany, and Stacy&#39;s fault for egging 
Sandi on to kiss you.&quot;

&quot;Kind of figured. Then Sandi wasn&#39;t the only one that brought it on 
herself.&quot;

&quot;Hey, here comes the train!!&quot; said Jane. &quot;Let&#39;s beat it!!&quot;

How right she was--its headlight lighting up the vast tunnel, one of the 
largest diesels, the Lawndale Universal Lines number 7000 locomotive was 
barreling down at 70 miles per hour, blowing its airhorn. Upon seeing 
that, Jane and Quinn ran out from the tunnel, and on to safety--and that 
was when they turned and saw that Daria was still in the tunnel, in the 
path of the highballing train, transfixed by its headlight, unmindful of 
its horn.

&quot;Daria!!&quot; called Jane. &quot;Come on!!&quot;

&quot;Get off the tracks!!&quot; called Quinn.

And that was when the auburn DID get off the tracks, and hightailed it 
for the right hand wall of the tunnel, flattening herself against 
it--seconds before the 806 ton locomotive sped past, its wheels crushing 
and harmlessly detonatiing the bullet that Jane had placed.

What happened next was straight out of the scene from the film version 
of Pink Floyd&#39;s The Wall; the speeding train was a hodgepodge of tank 
cars, box cars, gondolas, flat cars, auto carriers, container cars and 
piggy back cars, the wheels clicking and clacking on the rails, the 
heavy rumbling echoing in the tunnel, a whoosh of wind blowing Daria&#39;s 
hair--and that was when the auburn cynic, who was hugging the wall, 
closing her eyes and oblivious to the train, heard over the din, Sandi&#39;s 
voice: &quot;YOU!!&quot;

HAD she heard it? Opening her eyes, Daria turned to the source of the 
voice, and to her surprise, saw through the gaps between the railroad 
cars, Sandi, at the other side of the tunnel&#39;s far wall, across the 
tracks, pointing to her.

&quot;YOU!!&quot;

No. It couldn&#39;t be. Why would Sandi be here? Was it a hallucination? 
Still it seemed so REAL........and yet the brunette called out,&quot;You did 
it!!&quot;

The auburn couldn&#39;t believe what was happening. First the kiss, then the 
nightmares, then her inability to concentrate on her work and now that.

&quot;You kissed me, Daria!!&quot;

When the train finally left the tunnel, Sandi was gone. Trying to get 
her thoughts together, Daria picked up the crushed bullet, and staggered 
out from the tunnel, and back to safety where Quinn and Jane ran to her.

&quot;You OK?&quot; said the artist.

&quot;DAA-RIAAA!!&quot; shrilled Quinn. &quot;What&#39;s the matter with you?!? You&#39;ve 
could&#39;ve been killed in there!!&quot;

Unfazed by her sister&#39;s verbal onslought, Daria asked, &quot;Where&#39;d Sandi 
run off to?&quot;

&quot;Sandi?!?&quot; said the redhead. &quot;In the railroad tunnel?!? Why would she be 
doing there? Daria, you&#39;re nuts!!&quot;

&quot;All I know is what I saw.&quot;

&quot;That couldn&#39;t be. Sandi was on her way with Stacy and Tiffany to 
Cashman&#39;s, and I&#39;d meet them later--and that was when I saw you and Jane 
on your way here.&quot;

&quot;If you ask me,&quot; said Jane to her auburn friend, &quot;you&#39;ve got Sandi on 
your mind.&quot;

&quot;&quot;As long as it ain&#39;t love,&quot; said a puzzled Daria.

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know....we DO know you&#39;ve been flunking a few of today&#39;s 
tests, and we all know of your perfect record,&quot; said the artist.

&quot;You too, Daria?&quot; said Quinn in surprise. &quot;Sandi flunked several of her 
tests for today herself. It&#39;s not like her to do that--for that matter, 
it&#39;s not like you too either.&quot;

&quot;Me and Sandi in love....,&quot; said the auburn.

&quot;....is THAT possible?&quot; said Jane. From there, The Partners In Crime 
joined Quinn in a chorus of, &quot;EW!!!!&quot;

By the time Daria and Jane entered The Pizza King--with the opening bass 
lines of Pink Floyd&#39;s The Happiest Days Of Our Lives playing in the 
background --there was some activity happening in one corner of the 
place--and it was centered on one Charles &quot;Upchuck&quot; Ruttheimer III, who 
was bawling his head off.

&quot;Did we miss something?&quot; said the artist.

&quot;Seems like Upchuck just got turned down by Cristina Aguilera,&quot; said the 
auburn.

That was when Andrea came up to the duo and said, &quot;Hey, did you hear the 
latest rumor?&quot;

&quot;Rumor?&quot; said Jane.

&quot;According to Kevin and Brittany,&quot; said the goth girl, &quot;they overheard 
Sandi Griffin confide to Tiffany Blum Deckler, that she was in love 
with&quot;--she pointed to Daria--&quot;Daria here.&quot;

&quot;WH------------AT?!!?&quot; gasped The Partners In Crime.

As if to verify that statement, Jodie and Mack showed up, the former 
saying, &quot;We thought they were pulling our leg, but they claim they 
definitely heard Sandi say it, word for word. Needless to say, the first 
person they told was Upchuck, and now, he says he is heartbroken, having 
lusted for you and Sandi.&quot; Shaking her head in disbelief, Jodie added, 
&quot;Can you believe such a half baked story?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re saying,&quot; said Daria, &quot;that Brittany and Kevin claim that they 
heard Sandi say she&#39;s got the hots for me? Surely you jest.&quot;

&quot;Who knows?&quot; said Mack glumly. &quot;We&#39;re living with a whole bunch of 
freakazoids when it comes to Upchuck, Brittany, Kevin and Sandi.&quot;

Turning to her friend, the auburn asked, &quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;Seems like we just stepped into The Twilight Zone,&quot; said Jane.

&quot;Submitted for your approval,&quot; said Andrea,&quot;When Daria Morgendorffer 
stepped in The Pizza King, she had no idea that a rumour that Sandi 
Griffin, the President of The Fashion Club, had said to her friend 
Tiffany, aka The Gal That Says A Few Words, that she not only kissed our 
glasses wearing heroine, but also fell in love with her. Rumor or real 
story? Who knows? All we know is that all may be revealed when Daria and 
Sandi wind up--in The Twilight Zone.&quot;

Surprised by the goth girl&#39;s statement, Daria grinned her best Mona Lisa 
smirk, saying, &quot;I couldn&#39;t had said it better myself.&quot;

&quot;Ditto,&quot; said the artist.

Just then, Sandi, with Stacy, Tiffany and Quinn in tow entered, and 
stoliclly approached the auburn and boldly spoke with,&quot;Daria, you, me, 
in the bathroom----NOW.&quot;

Paling, Daria turned to Jane and murmured, &quot;You don&#39;t think she&#39;s still 
teed off over that kiss?&quot;

&quot;Could be,&quot; murmured the arttist. &quot;She may also be furious over the 
rumor that Kevin The Thomson and Brittany The Taylor spread to much of 
Lawndale High.&quot;

&quot;Something tells me the lipstick just hit the fan.&quot; Turning on her 
heels, the auburn ran out the door, only for Sandi to follow her, 
demanding, &quot;Like, where do you think you&#39;re going?!?&quot;

&quot;To the land of hunger, where else?&quot; was the reply.

That was when the brunette reached out and grabbed Daria&#39;s arm, trying 
to pull her back. &quot;Stop it, Daria, and listen to me!!&quot;

NO!!&quot; said a frightful Daria, who tried to pull free from Sandi&#39;s grip. 
&quot;The last thing I need is a run in with you!!&quot;

&quot;Will you listen to me?!?&quot;

&quot;No!!&quot;

&quot;Yes!!&quot;

&quot;No!!&quot;

&quot;Yes!!&quot;

&quot;No!!&quot; 

Pulling her arm free, the auburn ran down the sidewalk, with the 
brunette coming on behind and calling out, &quot;Daria, stop!!&quot;

From the door of The Pizza King, Quinn called out, &quot;Sandi!! Come back, 
Sandi!!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;re you trying to do?!?&quot; said Stacy.

&quot;You&#39;re crazy,&quot; said Tiffany. Then under her breath, she added, &quot;Crazy 
in love....&quot;

Try as she might, Daria found out the hard way she was unable to shake 
Sandi off her trail. Part of the problem was that the auburn&#39;s Doc 
Marten boots were heavy and clumsy when it came to speed. That, along 
with the fact that Daria wasn&#39;t as fit to run like Jane was. But then, 
Sandi&#39;s lithe weight (as part of The Fashion Club&#39;s requisite) and her 
running shoes had a hand in the brunette&#39;s ability to stay on Daria&#39;s 
tail. 

So in place after place--The Clean-Itt-Up Laundromat, up the fire escape 
and along the roof of an apartment building, a local supermarket, even a 
gas station--no matter where the auburn hid out at, there was The 
Fashion Club brunette, always taking her by surprise, and saying, &quot;Stop 
it, Daria, and listen to me!!&quot;

It wasn&#39;t until Daria reached Dega Street, when she darted into The Zen, 
and into the bathroom--only for Sandi to come out of one of the stalls 
saying, &quot;You can&#39;t run forever, Daria!!&quot;

Back on Dega St., the auburn ran across--and nearly causing several cars 
to collide and drivers to shout, &quot;Hey, stupid, look both ways before you 
cross the street!!&quot;--before reaching the other side, to The Red 
Barchetta Hotel. But then, the fact that the Morgendorffer house was in 
the route between The Pizza King and Dega St., where The Zen and the 
hotel were, Daria could had hid out at home--but then she didn&#39;t think 
of it. Besides, there was no telling if the brunette could break down 
the door--or worse.

Entering the hotel, running past the vast marbled foyer and the 
registration section, Daria ran past the fountain in the center foyer, 
and upon glancing back, she could see Sandi, a yard behind her, still 
chasing. Ahead was a gauntlet of twelve elevator doors--six on the left 
hand side, and six on the right hand side--and that was when, with a 
boundful leap, the auburn skidded to a halt at the extreme right 
elevator on the left hand wall, and jabbed the up button franticlly, 
while the brunette was getting nearer-- and at last, the doors opened, 
and Daria ran in, jabbing the button for the 12th floor, closing the 
doors, which slammed in the hapless Sandi&#39;s face.

Safe for the moment in the ascending elevator car, Daria leaned against 
the wall. On both sides of the doors were the control panels, each with 
a complicated quota of buttons; above them, was the two color LED floor 
counter, which was counting the levels to the 12th floor. But when the 
12th floor was reached and the doors opened, there was Sandi.

&quot;Like, you just don&#39;t get it,&quot; she said.

The auburn couldn&#39;t believe it. The brunette known as Sandi Jillian 
Griffin had never been that relentless before. and now the whole farce 
was getting out of hand. Jabbing the button for the 27th floor, she 
said, &quot;Sorry, we&#39;re all full up,&quot; before the doors seperated Daria from 
Sandi. So far, so good--but for how long? The floor counter was 
counting: 23....24....25....26....27. The doors opened......and there 
was no one. No one at all. 

Breathing a sigh, the auburn started to step out--and that was when the 
brunette jumped out from behind a fake decorative bush near the 
elevator, and stated to enter. 

&quot;Gahh!!&quot; gasped Daria. &quot;Leave me alone!!&quot; She reached for the last 
button on the panel, a topmost button marked CT--short for Clock Tower; 
the doors started to close, but Sandi said, &quot;No, you don&#39;t,&quot; before she 
stuck out her hand, blocking the doors, causing them to reopen. The 
safety feature built in the elevator on her side, the brunette stepped 
in the car before the doors could close, and the elevator was on its way 
to the last level. 

&quot;You just don&#39;t give up, do you?&quot; said the auburn.

&quot;We Griffins were born to be relentless,&quot; said the brunette.

Glancing back at the counter, Daria could see she was getting nearer, 
for it was now counting: 28....29....30....CT (for Clock Tower). The 
doors opened, Daria ran out, and so did Sandi--who called out, &quot;Daria, 
stop!!&quot; --before they headed down the passage, and into a vast complex 
of gears, flywheels and the three huge weights, hanging on pulleys and 
cables in their own shafts, which powered the clock, the carillon and 
the big bell. 

Reaching a door at the far end of the wall ahead, the auburn opened it 
and stepped through--to the outside of the tower, dwarfed by the giant 
clock face--and perched on a five foot ledge, which overlooked the whole 
Dega St., Lawndale, The Zen, and who knew what. Needless to say Daria 
gasped at almost falling over the edge. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna be remembered 
like that....&quot; she muttered. &quot;Of all the places I had to hide, I had to 
hide here--Jane&#39;ll never believe that.....&quot; 

Stepping back carefully so that she was away from the edge, the auburn 
backed up--and that was when someone spoke,&quot;Like, now will you listen to 
me?&quot;

Turning &#39;round, Daria could see it was Sandi coming out from the door in 
the clock face.

&quot;We can&#39;t go on meeting like that,&quot; the auburn stated before she 
added,&quot;Just punch me one and get it over with.&quot;

&quot;Like, punch you?!?&quot; said the brunette. &quot;You thought I was picking a 
fight with you?!? Like, no way!! All I wanted was to say that we need to 
talk. Y&#39; see.....I&#39;ve got a confession to make. Remember when we kissed 
the other day? Well......since then.......oh,what&#39;s the use?!? I love 
you, Daria!!&quot;

&quot;WHAT?!!?&quot; For Daria, what she just heard proved that Brittany and Kevin 
HAD overheard Sandi and Tiffany. &quot;You can&#39;t be THAT serious, can you?&quot;

&quot;Yes I am....,&quot; replied Sandi somberly.

Suddenly, the clock&#39;s second hand reached 60,and at the same moment, the 
hour hand touched 5--and that was when the carillon bells played the 
Whittington tune, the vibrations, if not the noise, from them taking the 
auburn and the brunette by surprise; that was followed by the big bell 
which rang five times, causing the girls to stick their fingers in their 
ears.

&quot;Whoa!!&quot; said Sandi. 

&quot;And I thought the noise Trent and his band made,&quot; said Daria,&quot; was the 
noisiest thing in Lawndale!!&quot;

Seeing her chance, the auburn ran back through the door in the clock 
face, back into the tower works--just as the bell sounded its fifth 
strike.

Shaking her head to stop the ringing, the brunette turned to where Daria 
was, only she wasn&#39;t there.

&quot;Hey, come back here!!&quot;

Back in the tower, Daria had reached the elevators, when the doors of 
the extreme right elevator opened, and Amy Barksdale stuck her head out 
and said, &quot;Hey, Daria!! Over here!!&quot;

Grateful her favorite aunt had come, the auburn entered the car, and 
soon they were on their way down.

&quot;Thanks for coming for me, Aunt Amy.&quot;

&quot;Antything for my favorite niece,&quot; said Amy. &quot;Only, what were you doing 
in the clock tower? It&#39;s a restricted section which can only be reached, 
using a keycard--wait a minute......&quot; Spotting a keycard slot in the 
left hand panel, she pulled out a plastic card. &quot;Well, no wonder....!! 
One of the staffers left a keycard here after the last maintenance 
check. Better get that back to them before Tachibana shreds someone&#39;s 
jockey shorts.&quot;

&quot;Tachibana?&quot; echoed Daria.

&quot;Eiji Tachibana, the owner, founder and general manager of The Red 
Barchetta Hotel--and my latest boyfriend.&quot;

Shaking her head in amazement, Daria said, &quot;You sure know how to aim 
high when it comes to dating.&quot;

&quot;If I told you half the the stories &#39;bout the last few dudes that spent 
their money like water,&quot; said Amy, &quot;you&#39;d be beyond amazed. By the way, 
how&#39;s your mom and dad doing?&quot;

Sighing, the auburn replied, &quot;Don&#39;t ask.&quot;

The fact that Daria was Amy&#39;s favorite niece, the latter chose not to 
ask what the former was doing in the clock tower, much less press any 
charges against her. So far, the auburn had eluded Sandi for the 
moment--again; having reached the main floor, she hightailed from The 
Red Barchetta Hotel, through the forest section of town which was a 
hopeful shortcut to home. Along the way, however, she was thinking over 
what Sandi had said back at the clock tower, that she, the most stuck up 
member of The Fashion Club, was in love with her, of all people. Sandi 
Griffin. Quinn&#39;s best friend. Another girl. One thing was for sure, it 
definitely verified Brittany and Kevin&#39;s story.

Had it been the kiss that started it all? Daria was puzzled--and worst 
of all, now way beyond worn out from all the running, and, a few yards 
near the edge of the forest, marked by a large oak tree, unable to 
continue. Right now, upon stopping to rest near the said tree,she was 
panting and gasping for breath--but once again, Sandi&#39;s voice broke into 
the auburn&#39;s reverie with, &quot;What&#39;s the matter, Daria?&quot;

Against her better judgement, Daria looked up--

--and on one of the strongest branches of the oak tree overhead, was the 
brunette, who now said, &quot;Can&#39;t see the forest between the trees?&quot;

Already luckless, strengthless and unable to run further, the auburn 
groaned, &quot;Oh----------no.....!!&quot; before she fell to the grassy ground, 
on her back.

Jumping down from the branch of the tree to the ground, Sandi knelt down 
near Daria, and said for the second time, &quot;Like I said, now will you 
listen to me?&quot;

&quot;OK, you got me,&quot; said a breathless Daria. &quot;It was that kiss wasn&#39;t it?&quot; 
&quot;Yup,&quot; replied the brunette. &quot;That, and something else--the fact that 
for all my life, I am a lesbian....even up to the day you and Quinn 
first came to Lawndale.....you two were so gorgeous, but I couldn&#39;t 
decide....which of you two was a lesbian like me--you, Quinn or 
both.....&quot;

&quot;And you thought me and Quinn were bi too. I had a feeling you were one 
judging from what you said to me at the clock tower.&quot;

&quot;What did I say to you?&quot;

&quot;You said, &#39;Yes I am,&#39; which is the album title of another lesbian-- 
Melissa Ethridge,&quot; said the auburn, who was gradually getting her 
strengh back. 

&quot;But there&#39;s more.&quot; From there, the brunette related to the cynic 
auburn, everything she had told Tiffany in the Lawndale High bathroom, 
from the feelings she enjoyed when she kissed Daria, to her feeling the 
auburn&#39;s breasts and nipples brush alongside hers, from the dreams she 
had at night, along with her masturbating, to what kind of body she 
thought might be beneath Daria&#39;s clothing, everything. When she had 
finished, the auburn said, &quot;Sandi, you&#39;re blowing the whole thing out of 
proportion. I couldn&#39;t be bi, let alone a beauty.&quot;

&quot;Maybe not a beauty on the outside, but inside, there&#39;s a beautiful 
sweet girl--and, like, a sexy one at that, just waiting with potential, 
given the right makeover from The Fashion Club, to bring it to the 
surface. But no--you keep any hint of beauty, let alone any passion of 
love, behind those walls of cynicism....!!&quot; Tears were now streaming 
from the brunette&#39;s eyes and down her face while she sobbed, &quot;Me, and 
the rest of The Fashion Club almost came close to flushing out that 
beauty hidden within you for that make over at the parade, when you and 
that rugrat Tad Gupty climbed onto our float!! Even Stacy was willing to 
share her scrunchie for you!! But YOU had to go and use blackmail on 
Quinn to get out of it!! You were my first kiss.......and 
now.....sob.....now, you prove to me that brains like you have no 
passion of love!!&quot; 

Pitching her head back, Sandi wailed her loudest, &quot;OH, DARIA, YOU DON&#39;T 
LOVE ME!! JUST WHEN I THOUGHT YOU DID!! 
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

True, Daria wasn&#39;t one for sympathy, but even so, she couldn&#39;t stand 
anyone crying--not even Sandi. Getting up on her knees, she crawled over 
to the brunette and muttered, &quot;What did I do to deserve it? Please let 
there be for me, a brain hemorrage.&quot; Then, she reached out and placed a 
comforting hand on the brunette&#39;s shoulder, and said, &quot;Listen, Sandi, 
you don&#39;t have to cry &#39;bout it.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t help it,&quot; sobbed Sandi. &quot;If, like, you don&#39;t love me, then 
why&#39;d you kiss back in the first place?&quot;

A good question indeed....why? For the auburn, the feel of Sandi&#39;s rose 
petal mouth, the way it felt so creamy, so sensuous, its silk feel 
tasting like cherry, no doubt from the lipstick the brunette used. And 
that was when it dawned on Daria, as why she kissed back, not to mention 
why she enjoyed kissing another girl......the incredible sparks of 
passion flowing from those lips, and spreading all over Daria&#39;s body, 
triggering all sorts of hidden feelings she never knew she had. For what 
she felt was the joy of her first kiss from another girl. So if she had 
been a bi and didn&#39;t know it till Sandi&#39;s kiss awakened them.... still, 
she had to be sure......even it was against her reputation as a 
cynic.....even if cost her love life with Tom....even if it meant 
hurling a monkey wrench into the relationship works with Jane and 
Quinn.... and there was only one way--dredge out the lover within 
her......

Already the auburn was drawn to the brunette&#39;s lovely face, her green 
eyes dewy with tears, her equally dewy mouth.... her soft breasts and 
body beneath her clothing....that did it. Dredging her courage, Daria 
stammered, &quot;So you say a brain like me ain&#39;t got no passion--but with 
your help, I MAY prove you wrong.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; said Sandi.

Muttering a quick &quot;Forgive me, Tom, Jane and Quinn,&quot; the auburn threw 
her arms &#39;round the brunette, pulled her in as close as she could, 
molding her body with hers and fully kissed as long and as deep on the 
mouth, never stopping.

At first, Sandi was shocked, then upset, then loving the kiss while she 
soon relaxed, kissing along with Daria, as firm and deep and long and 
sweet, moaning, &quot;Mmmmmmm,&quot; through her still kissing lips, closing her 
eyes and pulling the auburn even closer, and grabbing handfuls of 
Daria&#39;s hair.....never mind that she was a geeky brain, just don&#39;t let 
it end.....to love and kiss the sweet girl hidden beneath that brainy 
cynic facade.....

Daria, for her part, was also relaxed, closing her eyes, moaning, and 
holding onto the brunette&#39;s hair which was fragnant with the scent of 
jasmine. It was at that point however, that Daria thought of something 
that she hadn&#39;t thought of trying with Tom, and chose to try it on 
Sandi.

To start with, the auburn ran the tip of her index fingernail up and 
down the brunette&#39;s back and spine till she moaned through her kiss, 
till she also took to doing the same to Daria, which sent waves of 
emotion that she never thought she&#39;d feel before--and that was when she 
stuck her tongue way deep in Sandi&#39;s mouth for a French kiss; needless 
to say, it didn&#39;t take long for the brunette to stick her tongue in the 
auburn&#39;s and entwine it with the other tongue.

Indeed, all that, combined with their breasts, though still covered by 
clothing, were pressing together, their nipples so engorged with blood, 
spreading shooting stars of fantastic love through their bodies. For 
Sandi, it was like she was flying high above the clouds in a Icarus like 
state of mind, away from the troubles of her two bratty brothers, her 
tyrannical mother, the clueless Tiffany, the crybaby Stacy, from the so 
called geeks and the pressures of The Fashion Club--and so forth.

For Daria, it was like that first kiss she had with Tom, only it was 
much more intense. For that matter, she and Tom never even gotten around 
to French kissing, and now she was finally doing just that--even if it 
was coming from another girl, who was also Quinn&#39;s best friend, and the 
selfish egotistical high strung President of The Fashion Club. And it 
felt great. The whole thing was like hurtling through the same time warp 
that brought Dave Bowman and his space pod in the film 2001: A Space 
Oydessy. And right now, thoughts were running through her mind: &quot;I 
didn&#39;t think it could happen to me....not like that. Forget the fact I 
am kissing a stuck up prissy popular girl, forget those inane Lawndale 
High faculty, forget Quinn, forget my folks, forget even Jane, Trent, 
and Tom.........but, PLEASE, may the moment we share last....!! Please 
don&#39;t stop!!&quot;

Sandi didn&#39;t want to stop herself, wanting such a state of bliss she and 
Daria were in to last. When they finally did have to stop, they were 
panting, sweating, with their lipstick smeared, &quot;Oh boy......!!&quot; said 
the auburn.

&quot;You see?&quot; breathed the brunette. &quot;You could do it......and, like, you 
truly proved me wrong.....&quot;

&quot;Now you can punch my lights out--but wait till I take my glasses off.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you&#39;re a geeky unpopular brainy misery chick on the outside.... 
but inside, you&#39;re something else.....!!&quot;

Smirking her Mona Lisa smirk, Daria stated, &quot;Maybe you should change the 
name of your group to The Passion Club.&quot;

For the first time, Sandi was laughing gently before saying, &quot;I doubt 
it. It wouldn&#39;t have the right ring to it--or WOULD it?&quot;

Just then, Jane&#39;s voice could be heard faintly: &quot;HEY!! Daria!! Is that 
you?!?&quot;

&quot;Time to go,&quot; said the auburn. &quot;If I know Jane, she&#39;ll call the 
hospital.&quot;

The girls got up one their feet, and just as they were ready to part, 
the brunette asked, &quot;When will I see you again?&quot;

At first, Daria thought of saying, &quot;You got your kiss, what more do you 
want?&quot; Instead however, she said, &quot;Tomorrow, at the rooftop of the 
Lawndale High building, where Brittany and Kevin make out.&quot;

Sandi paused before saying, &quot;OK,&quot; and blew a kiss, heading off down the 
forest to rejoin with The Fashion Club while Daria crossed the edge of 
the forest and out onto the street, to rejoin with Jane.

So once again, it seems that not only is Sandi bisexual, but now so is 
Daria. For a cynic, our glasses wearing heroine truly DID have a vast 
storehouse of passion hidden within, and all it took was a passionate 
kiss with Sandi to bring it to the surface. So quite obviously, it&#39;s 
only a matter of time before the auburn heroine and the cliquey brunette 
imminently take the next step.....guess what that next step may be. 
Could Daria succeed with Sandi when she failed with Tom? If so, how? 
Where? When? We know now that Sandi is TRULY in love with Daria......but 
IS Daria truly in love with Sandi.......? Only time will tell...... Oh, 
almost forgot--sorry it was such a long chapter, but I did all I could 
to show the details rather than tell, eh?
