<a href="../nonanime/catrogue-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>All four ladies were laughing at the end of the Miyuki-chan in Mirror 
Land episode. &quot;That was mildly perverted,&quot; Ororo said thoughtfully, 
&quot;but still cute, somehow.&quot;

&quot;Kawaii,&quot; Rogue and Kitty said in sing-song tones.

Both Raven and Ororo looked at them oddly.

&quot;Cute,&quot; Kitty smiled, &quot;in Japanese.&quot;

&quot;The flower-girls...&quot; Ororo shook her head.

Raven smirked, imitating the character&#39;s voice perfectly, &quot;I&#39;ve got a 
cut on my inner thigh! Look! Look!&quot;

They all broke up at that.



Elizabeth and Neal walked together, the sun just beginning to set, 
lighting up the street in fiery golden hues. Both were visibly 
content, filled with a generous meal from relaxing surroundings, good 
wine and good company.

&quot;Thank you for a lovely dinner,&quot; Elizabeth smiled.

Neal laughed, &quot;I had a great time, too.&quot; He looked at her sideways, 
&quot;I&#39;ve noticed you&#39;re not quite so stiff after Kitty&#39;s done training 
you.&quot;

Elizabeth laughed quietly, &quot;I&#39;m improving, but Kitty can certainly 
still put me in my place when she needs to.&quot;

Neal raised his eyebrow, &quot;Oh?&quot;

Elizabeth made a face, &quot;I got a bit cocky, and Kitty decided to 
demonstrate some new movies. I was on my back in seconds.&quot;

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Neal grimaced.

They walked on quietly, diverting down a small side street that served 
as a shortcut home. Neal never saw the blow coming, slammed up into a 
wall stunned. A sai was directed at Elizabeth&#39;s throat as a dark 
haired woman looked at her calmly.

&quot;Please tell your sensei that I look forward to meeting her tomorrow,&quot; 
was all she said, and then she was gone.

Neal shook his head groggily, &quot;Who was that?&quot;

&quot;Elektra,&quot; Elizabeth said softly. She grabbed his arm, &quot;We&#39;d better 
get back home fast. Kitty should know about this.&quot;

&quot;There goes our date,&quot; Neal sighed.



The sun was up, and the air crisp as they ran together along the 
beach. Elizabeth looked at Kitty oddly for a moment before venturing, 
&quot;You don&#39;t seem too worried.&quot;

&quot;Worrying wastes energy,&quot; Kitty smiled back. A bit more seriously she 
said, &quot;There isn&#39;t a lot I can really do. I&#39;m prepared, I think, so 
it&#39;s better just to let her come.&quot;

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Elizabeth admitted. They turned around and headed back 
to where Rogue was waiting for Kitty.

Since the first dunking incident, Rogue had made a point of not 
napping while Kitty and Elizabeth were doing their training. This 
time, she was reading a book, a fierce frown on her face. As Kitty 
grew nearer she called out, &quot;You actually liked this?&quot;

Kitty shrugged, &quot;Yeah!&quot;

Rogue made a face, and slipped a book mark inside. &quot;I liked Hobbit and 
Lords,&quot; she sighed, &quot;but these Unfinished tales are rough going.&quot;

Elizabeth smiled, &quot;I liked it.&quot;

She received a frown from Rogue for that remark. &quot;So are you two done 
beating each other up?&quot; Rogue asked.

Kitty nodded, &quot;Yeah, we&#39;re done.&quot;

The three of them made their way up the beach to the house, taking 
their time. Ororo stood out on the balcony, standing by Raven and 
looking out over the sea. Ororo smiled and waved before calling down 
to them, &quot;Have any of you seen Sage?&quot;

Kitty raised her eyebrows and looked at Rogue and Elizabeth. They both 
shook their heads, so she yelled to Ororo, &quot;No.&quot;

They got nearer, noticing that Raven was smiling while Ororo looked 
just a bit worried. &quot;It seems she didn&#39;t come home last night,&quot; Raven 
smiled.

&quot;Do you think there&#39;s trouble?&quot; Rogue asked Ororo. A little smile, &quot;Or 
do you think Heather and Sage got lucky?&quot;

A bit of a blush appeared on Ororo&#39;s cheeks.

&quot;Don&#39;t tease,&quot; Kitty chided Rogue, &quot;as team leader it&#39;s her job to 
worry like that.&quot;

&quot;Do you want us to start a search?&quot; Elizabeth volunteered.

From the living room behind them they suddenly heard Sage&#39;s voice call 
out worriedly, &quot;Search for whom?&quot;

All five rushed inside, to see Sage standing there still dressed in 
her clothes from the night before. Her hair was a bit messy, but other 
than that she looked her typical cool self. &quot;And where were you last 
night, young lady?&quot; Ororo asked.

&quot;She was with me,&quot; Heather said as she stepped into the living room. 
Sage, unsurprisingly, blushed furiously.

Kitty noticed how uncomfortable Sage was looking and led a reluctant 
Rogue out of the room. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen Sage blush like that before,&quot; 
Kitty smiled.

&quot;She only does that around Heather, you&#39;ll notice,&quot; Rogue noted. She 
frowned, &quot;But why did you want us to leave?&quot;

&quot;Body language,&quot; Kitty shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve done anything 
yet,&quot; and she smiled up at Rogue, &quot;but you&#39;d tease them anyway.&quot;

Rogue made a face, but commented, &quot;Guilty as charged.&quot;



Heather quietly said, &quot;We were talking, and it just got too late for 
her to head home.&quot; It was strange, but Heather almost felt like she 
was taking to Sage&#39;s father or something, while Ororo was grilling 
her. Raven, on the other hand, just looked amused.

To make matters worse, Sage had headed off to get changed into fresh 
clothes, leaving her there all alone with them.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Raven smiled. The shapechanger looked like she was having 
quite the good time with this.

Ororo looked rather more skeptical. &quot;It&#39;s not that far home,&quot; she said 
dryly. She fixed Heather with a steady gaze, clearly expecting to hear 
more.

Sage came back in, dressed in a small black dress that looked rather 
good on her. &quot;Why do I feel like I frightened my dad by being out too 
late?&quot; she asked the room in general.

Raven chuckled, and Ororo blushed. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said quietly.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Heather smiled. More quietly, &quot;I&#39;m glad Sage has 
such good friends.&quot;

&quot;Any new crisises we need to deal with?&quot; Sage asked curiously.

Raven looked at her curiously, &quot;Not that we know of. Why?&quot;

&quot;Because I&#39;d like to take her out for the day,&quot; Heather smiled at 
them.

&quot;We&#39;ll be back by dinner,&quot; Sage called out as she grabbed Heather&#39;s 
hand and literally dragged her out the door.

&quot;Looks like your little girl&#39;s all grown up,&quot; a impish Raven 
commented, and Ororo shot her a glare in reply.

&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Heather asked.

Sage sighed, &quot;Raven was going to continue to tease us, and I hate 
teasing.&quot;

Heather raised an eyebrow, &quot;I&#39;ll have to remember never to tease, just 
to tempt.&quot;

&quot;Tempt?&quot; Sage frowned.

&quot;Teasing&#39;s fun, but tempting has some follow through,&quot; Heather 
chuckled, gently caressing Sage&#39;s cheek.

Sage went red, &quot;Heather!&quot; They walked together silently for a few 
moments, then she quietly said, &quot;Thank you, for what you did last 
night.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Heather answered seriously. She smiled, adding, &quot;It 
was my pleasure.&quot;

Sage blushed once again.



Kitty and Rogue left the house a little while later to go grab some 
lunch together. They took their time walking, savoring the warm 
weather and gentle winds.

&quot;It&#39;s so beautiful here,&quot; Rogue sighed softly.

&quot;I would tend to agree,&quot; the voice said conversationally from right 
behind them.

Rogue jumped, but Kitty was unruffled. She just smiled at the dark 
haired woman as if she had expected to see her, &quot;Hello, Elektra.&quot; She 
quietly asked, &quot;How&#39;s Logan been?&quot;

&quot;He asked me to say hi,&quot; Elektra shrugged. The European woman smoothly 
fell into step beside them. She was quite attractive, but it was a 
dangerous beauty, much like a finely crafted sword that could cut you 
so very easily.

Rogue was looked at the two of them like they were crazy. &quot;Well,&quot; she 
finally sighed, &quot;at least you&#39;re being civilized about this.&quot;

Elektra nodded, &quot;No reason not to be.&quot; She looked at Kitty curiously, 
&quot;Shall we?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Kitty agreed. It didn&#39;t take long to find a deserted 
alley, and Kitty asked Rogue to guard the end, to keep any innocent 
bystanders away.

Elektra drew her two sais from their concealment in her clothes, and 
Kitty took up her guard posture. The two women gazed at each other 
intensely, something invisible seeming to pass between them in 
complete silence.

Finally, Elektra spoke up, &quot;It seems I can&#39;t influence your mind with 
the Hand&#39;s techniques.&quot;

Kitty smiled slightly, &quot; I have &#39;Ogun&#39;s skills, too. He even claimed 
to have taught the Hand that trick himself.&quot;

&quot;Then it comes to this,&quot; Elektra said, and attacked.

Kitty smoothly deflected the two sai strikes with her hands, shifting 
a little aside to avoid the kick she knew was coming when Elektra 
simply... stopped. She stepped back, tucking the sais away, then she 
bowed deeply.

Kitty bowed in return, &quot;Was that sufficient?&quot;

&quot;I would have lost,&quot; Elektra smiled slightly, &quot;in less than ten 
moves.&quot; As she turned and walked away she said over her shoulder, &quot;You 
have a very efficient style. I look forward to when you open a 
school.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Rogue looked at Kitty in disbelief.

&quot;You almost sound disappointed,&quot; Kitty laughed. She and Rogue left the 
alley together, &quot;She just wanted to know who was better, and she found 
out.&quot;

&quot;A professional, in other words,&quot; Rogue said thoughtfully.

&quot;Which worries me a little bit,&quot; Kitty admitted. &quot;It might mean that 
I&#39;ve come to the attention to the big leagues,&quot; she sighed.
