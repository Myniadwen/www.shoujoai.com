<h1>Tea for Two</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rozenmaiden/index.html">Rozen Maiden</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ryuchan.html">Carola "Ry√ªchan" Eriksson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>While each story (hopefully) can be read individually, I have written 
these three Rozen Maiden stories to occur in this order: 1 The Light of 
the Mercury Lamp, 2 Deep Red Ruby Dreams, and 3 Tea for Two. Tea for Two 
is placed a few days after the end of S2 of the anime, Rozen Tr&#132;umend.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Strange, the things that can herald change. In the case of Suigin Tou, 
the banner of change came in the shape of a fragile golden teacup set 
out in front of an empty chair.

Although perhaps the truly strange thing was that Suigin Tou noticed 
this one subtle change of d&#130;cor in Shinku&#39;s dream world instantly, as 
soon as she materialized from the shadows. When had she begun to 
catalogue every minute detail about the delicate blonde?

Suigin Tou had no answer. Perhaps she had always noticed everything 
connected to Shinku.

&quot;I remembered to set out a cup for my guest this time.&quot; Shinku&#39;s words 
were gentle, a response to the slight confusion that was evident in 
Suigin Tou&#39;s eyes. &quot;Won&#39;t you have a seat?&quot;

Still nonplussed Suigin Tou nonetheless accepted without a word, taking 
a seat in a dignified way. It was one of those things she and Shinku had 
in common, dignity, pride and a fondness for elegance. Unlike Shinku 
however, Suigin Tou&#39;s dreamscape held none of those qualities... perhaps 
that was why Suigin Tou felt more at home in Shinku&#39;s dream world than 
her own.

Or perhaps that was just due to the presence of its owner.

Daintily Shinku poured their tea, and they savoured it in silence. By 
the time her cup was almost empty Suigin Tou was frowning at the 
aromatic liquid as if it was to blame for her sense of being out of her 
depth. There were things she needed to say to Shinku, things she needed 
to ask, but the words eluded her grasp.

Finally Shinku set her cup down and waited until Suigin Tou&#39;s cerise 
eyes met her own.

&quot;I wanted to thank you, again, for what you did. I could not have done 
it alone.&quot;

Suigin Tou accepted the thanks with a small tilt of her head, although 
it was still fairly inconceivable to her that Shinku or the other Rozen 
Maiden should have anything to thank her for. &quot;How... how are they?&quot; 
Suigin Tou&#39;s voice was subdued and the expression in her eyes pained in 
a different way than they usually were.

Shinku smiled slightly. &quot;The children are fine. Hina Ichigo appears no 
different than from before... the events... and once she was reassured 
that she may visit as often as she wants she settled in with Kanaria and 
her medium without further protest.&quot; 

There was a brief pause and a sigh. &quot;While I know the decision to 
connect Hina Ichigo to a medium through Kanaria was for the best, I fear 
I shall still... miss her.&quot;

In her troubled musing Shinku missed the fond look bestowed upon her by 
her taller guest.

&quot;You always were very fond of your younger sister.&quot; Suigin Tou&#39;s voice 
was soft and surprisingly gentle. &quot;You have nothing to be concerned 
about, the little ones will undoubtedly spend annoying amounts of time 
at your home still. And you can always visit with them when you miss 
Hina Ichigo, during the day or in the dream world.&quot;

Suigin Tou reached out her cup in an unspoken request for a refill. &quot;No 
matter how strong the boy is, no medium could sustain four of our kind 
without damage to his own life-force. There was no other option.&quot;

Shinku poured herself a second cup as well. &quot;I know. Jun slept for most 
part of two days afterwards to restore his energy... if all four of us 
were to siphon his life-force daily he would not have enough left to 
move freely, much less grow as he needs to.&quot;

&quot;What of you, Shinku?&quot; Suigin Tou&#39;s concern was clear both in voice and 
expression. &quot;Have you recovered?&quot;

The answer was accompanied by a shockingly whimsical little smile on the 
otherwise so composed features. &quot;Once all was settled and everyone 
settled in to satisfaction, I went to sleep in my coffer. And as you 
know... I am sleeping still.&quot;

The strange expression prompted a rare chuckle to escape Suigin Tou&#39;s 
lips, something which surprised them both.

&quot;I will not be sleeping for much longer, however.&quot; Absently, as her 
attention lingered on Suigin Tou and the smile that had crossed pale 
features, Shinku touched her golden pocket watch as she spoke. &quot;I have 
rested enough for now, and I worry for what trouble the others will get 
into if I am not there to keep them in hand.&quot;

&quot;But more importantly, how are you faring Suigin Tou? You and your 
medium.&quot;

&quot;Megu is tired, but doing well. She is recovering.&quot; Cerise eyes clouded 
over at the thought of Suigin Tou&#39;s fragile human. Suigin Tou had 
drained herself, as had Shinku for that matter, in the joint venture 
that ultimately served to bring back Hina Ichigo and Sousei Seki to 
their rightful bodies, however the mediums had been required to 
relinquish a great deal of energy as well. Megu, so fragile and sickly, 
had no energy to spare to begin with, so even though Suigin Tou had 
received Megu&#39;s permission and blessing beforehand, she still felt 
almost ill with guilt over using Megu&#39;s precious life force this way. It 
was true though that the girl was recovering at a surprising rate, and 
did not seem to have suffered any lingering ill effects.

&quot;She eats regularly now, and tries to sleep as much as possible so that 
her strength will be as good as it can be before the operation.&quot; Megu 
would finally have her heart attended to, and if all went well Suigin 
Tou&#39;s frail human would in time no longer be bound to a hospital bed, 
carrying a death-sentence and wishing for an angel of death to grant her 
a quick and merciful end. Suigin Tou intended to pour some extra energy 
into her medium when the surgery date came, to increase Megu&#39;s chances, 
and she suspected that Shinku would be there doing the same.

&quot;That is good.&quot; Bright blue eyes levelled a rather direct stare at 
Suigin Tou. &quot;Now, do I need to repeat my question?&quot;

Suigin Tou flustered a little under that stare. &quot;I-I am doing fine. I 
have been sleeping, mostly, and like you I am just about restored.&quot; She 
took a quick sip of her tea to hide her sudden and embarrassing bout of 
nerves. &quot;What of the gardeners?&quot;

Shinku relented a little. &quot;Suisei Seki and Sousei Seki are as one might 
expect, truly. Suisei Seki is very emotional and clings to Sousei Seki 
at all times, not allowing Sousei Seki out of her arm&#39;s reach and 
constantly worries about all manner of things that might cause Sousei 
Seki harm. Sousei Seki on the other hand is clearly bewildered but too 
ridden by guilt to object to the treatment.&quot;

&quot;I wonder... if perhaps Sousei Seki had not fully realized the depth of 
Suisei Seki&#39;s emotions before?&quot; Shinku mused over the rim of her teacup. 
&quot;She seems almost... dazed by Suisei Seki&#39;s intensity.&quot;

Pale hands carefully twirled the now empty cup as Suigin Tou avoided 
meeting Shinku&#39;s eyes. &quot;No, I dare say Sousei Seki&#39;s true problem is... 
something else.&quot;

There was a momentary silence before Suigin Tou caved in to Shinku&#39;s 
unspoken demand for a clarification. She sighed. &quot;I do not wish to go 
into this in much detail, for as you know I found out these things about 
our sister through... less pleasant means.&quot; The reference to the time 
and manner in which Suigin Tou acquired Sousei Seki&#39;s Rosa Mystica made 
the intense pink-tinted eyes darken with pain and shame. Oh if only she 
had not been so easily manipulated.

If only they had not all been so easily manipulated.

&quot;Sousei Seki has a... problem with her... sense of self. She believes 
herself to be of no value, that she was created... well, as either a 
failed experiment or as an intended sacrifice.&quot; Suigin Tou frowned and 
crossed her arms across her chest. It was ironic, really, how alike in 
that aspect they were, she and Sousei Seki. &quot;She believed that Suisei 
Seki did not need her anymore, and as a last service she...&quot; Suigin Tou 
faltered slightly.

&quot;...challenged me with the intention of losing.&quot; Suigin Tou could not 
look at Shinku, and her voice wavered. &quot;Sousei Seki knew that I would 
not let anyone else defeat you, and thought chances were good that I 
would take out most of the remaining Rozen Maiden before confronting 
you.&quot;

&quot;Sousei Seki&#39;s biggest mistake in her calculations was that she believed 
that the result of our encounter would be your defeat by my hands, and I 
myself left weakened by the battle and by not having a medium to draw 
strength from. This way I would have made an easy defeat for the enraged 
Suisei Seki, whom then would be the one to achieve Alice.&quot;

Quietly. &quot;Do not think less of her, Shinku. However misguided, Sousei 
Seki acted out of love.&quot;

A slender hand briefly moved in a small gesture of weariness before 
settling elegantly on a crimson-clad lap. &quot;How could I fault Sousei 
Seki, when we were all so easily manoeuvred in that twisted, hellish 
dance?&quot; Shinku shook her head slightly. &quot;No, I could not... although I 
believe I may have to have words with my dear sister, once Suisei Seki 
has calmed down enough to allow it.&quot;

&quot;After all... Sousei Seki did not know... that I would never have...&quot; 
Suigin Tou was having difficulty saying what she felt she had to, even 
though she knew it would be no surprise to Shinku. &quot;...that I would 
never have allowed...&quot;

&quot;You gave your life defending mine.&quot; Shinku cut in with a voice more 
emotional than Suigin Tou could recall ever having heard from the 
usually somewhat reserved blonde. &quot;And even after that your soul came to 
me, to support and strengthen me in the battle against Bara Suishou.&quot;

&quot;I know how you feel about me, Suigin Tou.&quot;

And of course Shinku would, since Suigin Tou&#39;s soul had for a moment 
resided in Shinku&#39;s. All Suigin Tou&#39;s feelings, thoughts and memories 
would have been clear to see if Shinku wanted to. The pale features 
washed over with a rosy blush, yet Suigin Tou held her chin high, 
proudly, and spoke in quiet but unwavering voice. &quot;I love you.&quot;

To her surprise there was an answering blush on pink cheeks as blue eyes 
lifted to meet cerise ones. &quot;And I love you as well, Suigin Tou.&quot;

&quot;You... complete me. We complete each other.&quot; A shy smile accompanied 
the statement.

&quot;We... are a pair?&quot; Suigin Tou was surprisingly timid and her words 
somewhat cryptic, but fortunately Shinku understood perfectly.

&quot;We are. A matching set, two halves of one whole, mates... yes, we are a 
pair.&quot;

The brilliantly joyous smile Suigin Tou gave her at the reply made 
Shinku breathless, but it did not end there. Suigin Tou swiftly stood 
and rounded the antique table to kneel at Shinku&#39;s feet, looking up at 
her with such longing and devotion it made Shinku tremble.

Reverently near-white hands clasped one of Shinku&#39;s and lifted so that 
Suigin Tou could place one adoring kiss upon Shinku&#39;s palm. Shinku 
reached out to trace the side of Suigin Tou&#39;s face with the other, and 
then...

Then Shinku were in Suigin Tou&#39;s arms, held tightly but gently against 
the taller form, and with the warmth, the softness that was Suigin Tou 
surrounding her. Silvery white hair formed a veil around Shinku as 
Suigin Tou leaned her head against Shinku&#39;s, and Shinku&#39;s fingers found 
their way into warm and silky-smooth black feathers.

Yes. This was being complete. This was... perfect.

They held onto one another for a long time, neither of them willing to 
relinquish this new and incredible sensation anytime soon. Shinku smiled 
into Suigin Tou&#39;s shoulder as she felt fingers lightly playing in her 
hair.

&quot;Suigin Tou?&quot; A soft murmur into a black velvet-clad shoulder. &quot;When you 
awaken... would you come visit me?&quot;

They had spent a long time in Shinku&#39;s dream world, and Shinku could 
feel the pull of the human world strengthen. It would be time to awaken 
very soon.

&quot;I...&quot; Suigin Tou hesitated, her voice betraying her concern and 
lingering guilt. &quot;I think the others would not approve of my presence.&quot;

&quot;I desire your presence.&quot; Shinku&#39;s voice was strong and firm, as was her 
resolve. &quot;That will be enough for them.&quot;

Her tone gentled. &quot;Give them time, Suigin Tou... time to get to know 
you. They will accept you, too. I am certain of it.&quot;

They parted to share a tender look.

Suigin Tou sighed. &quot;Megu is calling me. I suppose I really should wake 
up and check on her.&quot;

Shinku smiled in understanding. &quot;I think Hina Ichigo is trying to wake 
me, as well. It would not surprise me if she and Suisei Seki have 
managed to create some minor disaster while I was away.&quot;

A moment of silence. &quot;Prepare them, will you? I...I would not want 
anyone to think that I am attacking them.&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot; Shinku promised, then eyed Suigin Tou in a peculiar way. 
&quot;Suigin Tou, lean down towards me for a moment.&quot;

When Suigin Tou complied with the request Shinku reached out to grasp 
her face in both hands, leaning up slightly to place a light, lingering 
kiss on Suigin Tou&#39;s lips. Startled Suigin Tou froze at first, but 
caught on after a moment and responded sweetly to Shinku&#39;s kiss.

They remained this way for some time before Suigin Tou took a small step 
back and, with a tiny regretful sigh, disappeared in a rain of colourful 
sparkles.

Shinku, looking into space at the spot where Suigin Tou had vanished, 
touched fingers to her lips with a sense of wonder.

So this was what it was like to share a kiss with the one you love.

Shinku&#39;s smile was positively giddy, and she could not help but hug 
herself in joy. Even as she allowed herself to begin to leave the 
dreamscape to return to the world of humans, a whisper left her lips to 
linger behind as Shinku herself disappeared.

&quot;I will be waiting at the house... my Suigin Tou.&quot;
