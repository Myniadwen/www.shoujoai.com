<pre>The strive for perfection was the one thing they all had in common, 
along with the knowledge that each and everyone among them had fallen 
short of that intended but elusive goal in the eyes of their creator. 

In the case of Suigin Tou, the strive for perfection was far more than 
just that... it was her obsession, her purpose, the only reason she 
continued living. Far more than for the others, Suigin Tou needed to, 
no, _had to_ prove her worth by becoming the strongest, the one that was 
triumphant. If she was that, then she might finally win their maker&#39;s 
love and he would make her complete. 

All Suigin Tou ever wanted was to be whole. 

First to be born amongst her sisters Suigin Tou would naturally have 
taken the place of their leader in harsh times, the caretaker, the 
loving sister whose black wings would form a shield to protect her 
precious and innocent younger siblings against the dangers that might 
face them. She would have doted upon them and rejoiced in their 
happiness, content with her lot as she was. 

But her heart had been discarded, her soul inspected and found flawed, 
then thrown away uncompleted. Their maker had not even granted her the 
mercy of destruction, rather he appeared to have forgotten her existence 
completely as his focus &#150; and his love &#150; turned to the younger siblings 
who came after her. Suigin Tou watched from her dark discarded place the 
shadows of her sisters at play, heard their voices as they laughed 
together in those early days as she writhed in endless pain, alone. 

No one saw Suigin Tou&#39;s tears. 

This was all the base for Suigin Tou&#39;s existence, and it was the reason 
she was feared. Oh yes, Suigin Tou was aware that her younger sisters 
feared her and that many of them considered her evil; her and her alone, 
as their maker, their father, was never at fault. All of them... save 
for one very important exception. 

In that dark, desolate and twisted spirit world Suigin Tou had created 
for herself, Suigin Tou spent her time while awake in thought on many 
things, whereas her sisters would spend theirs in play, bound to a 
master that would love them. Suigin Tou of course had no one that loved 
her, and so she had no master. She had no use for play either, as she 
never had the opportunity to know what that was. 

Sisters. How strangely amusing it was that they used such a human 
concept to describe themselves, they who were alive but not born, not 
flesh, but wrought and given life by the hands of a genius. Their bonds 
to one another were not of a physical nature, but a spiritual, emotional 
one, and such things were too fluid, too ever-changing to label that 
easily. 

Having spent so much time in thought, Suigin Tou had realised how 
erroneous this chosen term were for their small group, even if the 
others had yet to grasp it. Suigin Tou had seen it... the maker&#39;s 
intention. 

With the dream-gardening pair, Suisei Seki and Sousei Seki, it was so 
blatantly obvious that even the others had understood from the start 
that there was something binding these two closer to each other than to 
any other Rozen Maiden. These two who shared a love so deep that in 
their earliest days they had done something unthinkable... Sousei Seki 
plucking out one bright green eye to trade for one of Suisei Seki&#39;s 
crimson red ones, and vice versa. Suigin Tou had of course not seen the 
pair back then, and thus not known that although the maker had created 
the two together their appearance were not identical; Suisei Seki 
long-haired and feminine in her sweeping green dress and Sousei Seki 
short-haired and androgynous if not masculine in her boy&#39;s clothing and 
tall hat. Suigin Tou had only known the maker&#39;s outrage when the deed 
was discovered, and while the maker did not undo it, their perceived 
rebelliousness prompted the creation of the next Rozen Maiden, all in 
the search of perfection. 

Suigin Tou wondered if it had ever even occurred to Sousei Seki and 
Suisei Seki to regret what they had done. Probably not, after all, their 
love for one another alone proved somehow strong enough that they were 
never separated... they slept and woke together, any master that 
accepted one of them into his or her heart by default accepting them 
both. 

She envied them that togetherness, thinking how wonderful it must 
feel... not to be alone. 

Eventually Suigin Tou realised that it was not only the dream gardeners 
that were created this way, with the intention of being a pair in the 
maker&#39;s mind, although none of the others were created like these two 
had been, together. Once she had this insight, the intention seemed oh 
so obvious to Suigin Tou&#39;s eyes... anyone who had seen the tiny 
annoyances, the braggart Kanaria and the childish Hina Ichigo would 
surely notice that the two of them were a matching set, in size and 
appearance as well as in spirit. Why it was that the maker saw fit to 
create two such helpless eternally small children was something Suigin 
Tou had yet to fathom, but in all honestly she could not care less. 
Kanaria and Hina Ichigo were weak and of no importance to her. 

Following this logic then of the seven Rozen Maiden there remained three 
whom Suigin Tou had yet to determine how the maker had intended to be 
paired: herself, number five, Shinku, and number seven, Bara Suishou. 
This was something of a dilemma. 

In her most bitter moments Suigin Tou would occasionally entertain the 
thought that otherwise was banned from her conscious, that she herself 
was probably not in their maker&#39;s plans &#150; having been discarded after 
all &#150; and therefore there was really only six real Rozen Maiden... 
leaving the ones yet to be matched Shinku and Bara Suishou. 

This possibility burned beyond belief, and for the longest time Suigin 
Tou managed to convince herself that this was so merely because she 
wished her existence to still be a factor with their maker, that he had 
not undone her life in his mind completely. In time she came to realise 
that this was not all the reason she hated the thought that she might 
not be a contender in this rather cruel little private struggle. Yes, 
more and more the truth of the matter was becoming too hard to ignore. 

Shinku. If Suigin Tou did not count for a real Rozen Maiden, then Bara 
Suishou was the one intended to form a pair with Shinku. And that was 
something Suigin Tou could not accept. 

_She_ was the one whose thoughts never strayed too far or too long from 
the elegant and almost haughtily proper red-clad blonde, _she_ was the 
one whom at any given moment, yes even when rising from her gilded 
casket after a long period of sleep, could accurately state the number 
of days, hours and seconds since her last encounter with Shinku. _She_ 
was the one who had devised a way to traverse through the realm of 
dreams so she could visit Shinku in her casket dreams, even though it 
was not Suigin Tou that had been given the power of dream gardening. 
_She_ was the one that ignored all others to obsess solely on the 
diminutive fifth. 

Surely the maker had intended them, Suigin Tou and Shinku, as the ones 
to be paired? 

The realisation had not been an easy one to stomach, much less to 
understand. The relationship between Suigin Tou and Shinku had always 
been an adversary one, their encounters either outright combat &#150; though 
neither had ever taken things too far before &#150; or a strange, almost 
affectionate hostility where Suigin Tou would issue threats like 
caresses to rose-dusted cheeks and Shinku haughty retorts like 
invitations. It was a long-standing habit that was hard to break. 

They had a unique kind of understanding, and Shinku was the only one 
that had Suigin Tou&#39;s respect. 

In the silence of her own mind, if Suigin Tou had a rare moment of 
complete stillness and clarity, she could admit to herself that she 
would never grasp why their maker had continued to create Rozen Maiden&#39;s 
after Shinku. Surely Shinku was the perfection personified that the 
maker sought after? To Suigin Tou&#39;s eyes there was nothing flawed about 
Shinku, nor could there ever be... even her faults seemed like 
perfection to Suigin Tou. Why had their maker not seen that? 

A final, startling, realisation had come late, when Suigin Tou had 
entered Shinku&#39;s dream after her resurrection, supposedly to issue 
threats and to show Shinku that she was not defeated after all, but in 
reality wanting to tell Shinku that she was not only alive but whole, 
that she had finally found grace enough in the maker&#39;s eyes to be 
completed. That she, Suigin Tou, was now a complete Rozen Maiden and 
worthy to become Shinku&#39;s mate at last. 

Of course, no words to that effect crossed Suigin Tou&#39;s lips as she 
neither knew how to speak them, nor would have quite had the nerve to 
issue such a claim before the perfect Shinku. After all, not only had 
Suigin Tou failed in combat against Shinku last time, but Shinku had 
also spoken the word that in all the time they had known each other 
Shinku had never said to Suigin Tou... the word that on anyone else&#39;s 
lips had been the grounds for their immediate execution, but from Shinku 
was Suigin Tou&#39;s soul&#39;s undoing. 

Junk. 

No, Suigin Tou, while fearless of most things, would not have the 
courage to state her intentions to Shinku after having been so 
completely undone in their previous meeting. What shocked her though and 
made Suigin Tou feel as something was crushing her chest, was that when 
it dawned upon Shinku that Suigin Tou in Shinku&#39;s dream was not a 
nightmare but the real thing, in a visit like they used to have, Shinku 
had unabashedly wept in joy.  

Perfect Shinku had wept with joy that she, the evil and incomplete 
Suigin Tou, still lived. 

Suigin Tou had reeled at the sight, and her own emotional response had 
been... overwhelming and just a bit frightening. The things she had 
wanted to do, the truth that had been right there before her, screaming 
and undeniable... it was just too much. Suigin Tou had fled with as much 
dignity she could muster during the circumstances, followed by an image 
of pale blue eyes that would haunt her. 

There was just no denying it to herself anymore. She, Suigin Tou, was in 
love, utterly and completely. 

A nearly white hand fluttered to her chest as a slow, warm and 
surprisingly shy smile bloomed on features that had oh so rarely known 
more than the tiniest upturn of pale pink lips. The softest of whispers 
escaped those lips to be carried away into the night. 

&quot;Shinku.&quot; </pre>
