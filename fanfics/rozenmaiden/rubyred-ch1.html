<h1>Deep Red Ruby Dreams</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rozenmaiden/index.html">Rozen Maiden</a>

<pre>Shinku sat in the windowsill, looking out into the night. The boy in the 
bed not far from her vantage point slept soundly, safely tucked away 
from all the hurtful things in the world underneath his blanket, and in 
their neat row of rose-decorated coffers Shinku&#39;s two resident sisters 
slept as well, gracing Shinku with a rare moment of being alone with her 
thoughts. 

A small wry smile touched Shinku&#39;s lips as her thoughts turned briefly 
to the pandemonium and chaos that marked the days at this house, the 
sheer noise of it so exhausting for someone so refined as herself. 
Although the childish antics of her servant and her companions was 
taxing from time to time &#150; Shinku steadfastly refused to acknowledge any 
immaturity in her own person, despite such things as her devotion for a 
certain show featuring a dog-puppet detective named Kun-kun &#150; she truly 
did enjoy living in this house.  

Clear blue eyes passed over the blanket-covered shape on the bed with 
some affection. Such a troublesome servant he was... yet both the boy 
and his sister were dear to Shinku, their failure in performance easily 
made up for by good intentions and good hearts. They were good children, 
not that Shinku would volunteer that information to them willingly while 
she nudged, baited and badgered both siblings to better themselves.  

Had she been taller than her rather diminutive stature, Shinku would 
have walked over and tucked the blanket a bit more securely around the 
boy. Instead Shinku was left to visually inspect what she could see to 
assure herself that his sleep was not troubled in any way. 

Satisfied with her inspection, Shinku&#39;s attention turned to the two 
closed coffers lined up next to her own. As visual inspection would tell 
her nothing of the two that slumbered inside Shinku reached out through 
other senses to touch first one then the other of her slumbering kin 
ever so gently. 

Hina Ichigo, the youngest of their family save for the mysterious and 
unknown seventh, slept soundly in her coffer, curled up with her 
favourite cuddly toy for the night. Her spirit was the brightest of all 
the sisters, even now bubbling and happy like a clear brook in the 
sunlight. Sucking her thumb in sleep and mumbling quietly about 
strawberries, Hina Ichigo&#39;s sleep was undisturbed by dark tidings and 
recent strife, and Shinku felt grateful for this.  

Although caring deeply for all her sisters, as well as being well aware 
that she was their natural leader, Shinku none the less tended to 
concern herself a bit extra in regards to this child... in fact, Shinku 
had worried for some time that her actions to part Hina Ichigo from her 
previous and well-loved master had been a decision that would cause Hina 
Ichigo sorrow. When the girl that had once been bound to Shinku&#39;s sister 
never came around to visit Hina Ichigo despite knowing where they lived 
and despite being invited, Shinku knew her decision had been sound. Some 
humans&#39; love were too fickle, and if Shinku could spare Hina Ichigo the 
pain of a repeat of their past she would... thankfully these particular 
humans, Shinku&#39;s Jun and his sister, were nothing if not caring. Though 
particularly the boy had an odd way of showing it at times, there would 
be no loneliness to break Hina Ichigo&#39;s heart. 

The other sister that lived with Shinku and her humans was a greater 
cause for concern. The delicate features that were usually schooled into 
a perfect mask shifted to a small frown that revealed Shinku&#39;s deep 
concern. 

Inside her coffer Suisei Seki was weeping in her sleep, her heart and 
spirit inconsolable for the distance between Suisei Seki and her beloved 
partner, Sousei Seki. Shinku closed her eyes in sympathetic pain and 
withdrew her senses, respecting Suisei Seki&#39;s need to grieve in privacy 
and knowing full well that she could not heal this wound for them. In a 
building in another end of this human city Sousei Seki surely felt the 
same pain and incompleteness, and wept in her sleep as well. 

A flutter of hesitation entered Shinku&#39;s mind as her heart told her that 
the pain that Suisei Seki felt now was familiar to Shinku because she 
had endured it too, this separation from the person that was one&#39;s other 
self. What a preposterous thought, she had not been created as the dream 
gardeners, she was not one half of a pair... where did this strange 
notion stem from? 

Unbidden an image came to Shinku&#39;s mind, of a pale face with intense and 
haunted cerise eyes, of white hair as soft as the finest silk, and of 
black wings embracing the sky. 

Suigin Tou? 

Why did she think of Suigin Tou? 

Certainly, Shinku could not and would not deny that Suigin Tou was very 
important to her, and of course in the light of the events that had 
unfolded recently it was a natural thing that Suigin Tou should occupy 
Shinku&#39;s thoughts upon occasion... surely this was not an oddity in and 
of itself. Although she was reluctant to acknowledge it, Suigin Tou 
often occupied Shinku&#39;s thoughts, although surely that was because they 
so often found themselves awake at the same time, and in combat? 

At least... 

At least Shinku did not forgo sleeping now because her dreams were 
haunted by nightmares about Suigin Tou&#39;s death. At least now that gaping 
hole of unspeakable loss that had resided inside her since she had 
watched Suigin Tou be consumed by flames was no longer there. At least 
now that Shinku knew Suigin Tou was back, not the same as before but 
whole at long last, at least now Shinku did not fear the night. And the 
night brought not unspeakable agony and nightmares anymore. 

A slight blush dusted Shinku&#39;s cheeks as she recalled how she had let 
down her guard completely and wept in joy and relief as she had realized 
that the Suigin Tou before her in the dream world was indeed the real 
Suigin Tou and not a phantom of her grief and guilt. It was not ladylike 
behaviour to blubber like a child, and Shinku worried that Suigin Tou 
would think less of her for her... momentary loss of self-control. 

Yet... Suigin Tou&#39;s own reaction had been... surprising. Shinku was 
surprised to feel herself tremble slightly as she recalled it, delicate 
hands clutching at the rich red fabric of her dress in confusion. 

The expression in those lovely yet tortured cerise eyes had been 
surprised at first at Shinku&#39;s uncharacteristic outburst, but then... 
the expression softened, and there was something, something warm, 
something completely new to them and shockingly pulling. Then Suigin Tou 
had disappeared before Shinku could discover what this new emotion was. 

There had always been a certain amount of twisted affection in the way 
Suigin Tou looked upon Shinku, and Shinku was aware of that. She knew it 
was a mutual bond, this strange affectionately adversary relationship 
that they shared, a curious connection completely different from that of 
all the others. Something in Shinku had always made her shy away from 
wondering too closely just why that was. 

That look from Suigin Tou had changed all that. 

Unconsciously Shinku&#39;s eyes lowered, searching the night-painted street 
below her high window. There was the telephone pole upon which Suigin 
Tou had stood that day. It was, of course, empty, and this was a good 
thing as the last thing Shinku wanted to do right now was fight Suigin 
Tou. Yet some part of Shinku was oddly disappointed. 

Slightly annoyed at herself Shinku turned away from the window, 
straightening her immaculate clothing and reaching for her cane in 
preparation to get down. Her gaze swept past the slumbering boy once 
more as she silently and gracefully slipped down beside the bed, then 
her eyes automatically settled on the shapes that held the other two 
that shared this room with her. 

A sudden realisation made her eyes go wide and her step falter, yes, 
almost stumble in place. 

Sisters. Precious and cherished sisters, each of them unique and 
therefore commanding an equally unique place, an equally unique love in 
Shinku&#39;s heart... yet the basic emotion, the basic connection was the 
same. Yes, there was perhaps one she loved just slightly more than 
another, or another to whom she felt closer to than the others, but when 
it all came down to it they were all her sisters and the love Shinku 
held for each of them was the same. 

But not Suigin Tou. 

Shinku never called Suigin Tou her sister, the word never appeared in 
her mind in connection to the tall and tortured first before now, and in 
truth Suigin Tou had never referred to Shinku as such either. The claim 
that Suigin Tou held on Shinku&#39;s heart was not like the others. It... it 
was... 

It was not sisterly. 

A shocking thought, for certain, but not earth-shattering as their 
sisterhood in essence was a chosen one, true sisterhood not a 
possibility for their kind. But if their bond was not that, what then 
was it? They were not friends, Suigin Tou and Shinku, although Shinku 
would have dearly wanted them to be, and what else could they be? 

The image came to Shinku&#39;s mind with astonishing clarity, with such 
vivid detail that Shinku could almost feel herself wrapped in the strong 
arms of the taller Suigin Tou as she was held to her chest tightly, 
white hair creating a veil around Shinku&#39;s field of vision. Pale pink 
lips were curved into a gentle smile, and the cerise eyes shone with 
such warmth it made Shinku breathless to envision. She could faintly 
hear the sound of long black wings rustling as they surrounded her, 
protected her... 

Shinku trembled with confusion and a strange, exhilarated excitement 
that was new to her. Stiffly and slowly Shinku made her way towards her 
own open coffer while her thoughts raced. Why would she imagine being 
held by Suigin Tou, and why did the idea feel so... so... nice? 

Why did the image of Suigin Tou&#39;s eyes free of their usual pain and 
looking upon her with love create such a blast of longing that Shinku 
gasped out loud with the force of it? 

Blue eyes turned to Suisei Seki&#39;s resting place. Was this what it felt 
like? Was this how Suisei Seki felt about Sousei Seki? If so Shinku 
could truly understand why being parted, even this small distance apart 
that Suisei Seki and Sousei Seki were, would cause such pain... but it 
certainly did not seem a very sisterly emotion to have. 

Was this something the maker had intended, something he had created in 
them? Could it be that this was a sign that it was time to stop the 
fighting, that the fighting was not all there could be for them, not all 
that their fate could hold? 

Could it be that Suigin Tou was what was needed to make Shinku&#39;s soul 
complete? 

Still wondering Shinku made her way to her coffer and climbed in, 
letting the top close as she made herself comfortable. She wondered 
suddenly if Suigin Tou would visit her in the dream world again tonight, 
and what reaction she would get if she invited the other to tea and 
conversation instead of their usual fare of challenges and insults. She 
wondered what Suigin Tou might think of being complete together with 
Shinku. 

The thought brought a smile to Shinku&#39;s lips as she settled in to sleep 
at last, Suigin Tou&#39;s face clear before her mind&#39;s eye and a sense of 
anticipation in her soul. Perhaps Suigin Tou would come tonight. 

In the depths of Shinku&#39;s heart there was the sound of wings. </pre>
