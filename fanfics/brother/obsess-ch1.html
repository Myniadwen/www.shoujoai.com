<h1>Obsession</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../brother/index.html">Brother Dear Brother</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I told myself I&#39;d write an Oniisama e fanfic one day! ^_^ I hope I 
did a good job with this one-I&#39;ve only seen up to episode 10 of the anime. 
^^;; 

This story is set around episode 10, when Mariko is in the 
hospital. It contains a few spoilers, but nothing major. 

------------------------------------------------------------

I hate you. 

You. You are the reason I lie in this hospital bed, cold, lonely and 
miserable. 

You rejected me. I begged you not to run away from me, and you did. 

Why? After I&#39;ve been so kind to you at school, defended you to those stuck- 
up bitches. I&#39;ve done so much for you, and how do you repay me? You turn 
your back on me. 

I know I lied to Tomoko and nearly broke up your friendship with her. I 
know I tried to hold you prisoner at my house. I know what I did was 
cruel, deceitful, and wrong. 

I&#39;m glad I did it. 

Because I did it for you. 

Everything. I supported you during the sorority initiations. I convinced 
Miya-sama and the Big Sisters to give you another chance when you failed 
to show up for the party. I invited you to share a special night with my 
mother and I, invited you into my home...shared my bathtub with you! 

You didn&#39;t appreciate any of it, did you? You don&#39;t care about me. You 
only felt sorry for me because my father&#39;s a pornography writer. 

You deceived me. I thought you really liked me. We got along so well from 
the moment we met, didn&#39;t we? 

The moment I saw you, I felt there was something special about you...I 
couldn&#39;t place it, but it drew me to you like a moth to a flame... 

Love at first sight. 

That&#39;s why I wanted so badly for you to be accepted into the sorority. Why 
I lied to Tomoko. Why I wanted to drive you and her apart. Why I only 
invited you to my party that night, asked you to my house, shared my 
bathtub...wouldn&#39;t let you leave... 

You&#39;re why I starved myself to the point of exhaustion. Why I lie in this 
hospital bed, weak and malnourished. 

You. 

All of this...for you. 

I love you, Nanako-san. I&#39;m not giving up so easily. Not without a fight. 

I won&#39;t rest until you are mine. 

------------------------------------------------------------

I don&#39;t care for Mariko&#39;s actions towards Nanako and Tomoko, but 
it&#39;s pretty obvious she has a reason. Her feelings for Nanako are just 
that strong, though it&#39;s still a bit hard to tell if they&#39;re really love 
or just infatuation. 

I think if she toned down her behavior and learned not to feel so 
threatened by Tomoko, she and Nanako might be a good couple. </pre>
