<a href="../outlawstar/atfirst-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>      Among warriors, a weakness should remain hidden, or it will be 
exploited.
      But what is weakness? What one calls a weakness, another will 
see as a source of strength.
      Aisha Clanclan, a proud warrior of the Catarl Catarl, has her 
own ideas of weakness and strength. Shaped by a fierce and arrogant 
society, her beliefs influence all of her actions with others. She 
presents the image of a strong warrior while keeping her fears 
inside.
       What do you do when a warrior&#39;s spirit is just not enough?

                        HEAVENS VENGEANCE
                       OUTSIDE BLUE HEAVEN

      &quot;Professor Khan?!?&quot;
      Mere hours ago, the assassin known as Twilight Suzuka and the 
Catarl Catarl warrior Aisha Clanclan entered the base of the criminal 
known as &#39;Heavens Vengeance&#39; hidden in the asteroid field around the 
space station Blue Heaven. After reviving Suzuka, who had run out of 
oxygen on her suit, the two women encountered a dozen combat robots 
sent to stop them. The robots proved to be less of a hindrance in 
their path and more of a good warm-up. In the depths of the base, 
they had found what appeared to be a laboratory, inside was someone 
they had assumed... well, not dead exactly, but definitely no longer 
in the physical realm.
      &quot;A pleasure to see you again my dears, yes, yes a pleasure.&quot; 
Suzuka frowned at the scientist.
      &quot;Skip the pleasantries Khan. What are you doing here? Gene said 
you were in the Galactic Leyline&#39;s library.&quot; Khan smiled and nodded.
      &quot;Yes, yes. The library, that was it. So much information there, 
but no way to test the new ideas I had, no, no way at all. So I 
returned to this place and Gabriel was kind enough to allow me the 
chance to experiment if I aided him a little, yes, yes that is it.&quot; 
Kahn smiled at the two women and nodded his head to Aisha. &quot;Speaking 
of him, Gabriel expressed an interest in you my dear. Said he was 
quite looking forward to meeting you, yes, yes he was.&quot;
      Aisha growled and narrowed her eyes, &quot;I don&#39;t think so. The 
only way I&#39;ll meet him is when I take him in for our bounty.&quot; Khan 
nodded, unsurprised at the woman&#39;s response.
      &quot;I thought as much, as much as I distain the use of violence,&quot; 
An electric click sounded through out the room and two devices on 
tracks in the ceiling slid into view. The bottom opened and a 
cylinder, capped by a dish, swung out to point at the two. &quot;If you 
cause no problems, you shall not be harmed.&quot;
     Aisha hunched down and growled deeper, preparing to launch 
herself at the scientist. The ends of the weapons snapped to focus on 
her, arcs of electricity going down their lengths. A part of her mind 
noted them, but she was confident Khan had nothing that could hurt 
her. Just before she lunged, however, a white blur ran in front of 
her. The devices changed targets and fired. Bolts of dark purple 
lightning slammed into Suzuka, throwing her back into the wall with 
only a soft, surprised gasp from the assassin before she slumped to 
the ground.
      &quot;Suzie!&quot; Aisha twirled back to Khan and lunged, just as pain 
exploded along her body as the lightning guns fired at her. Claws 
scraping the floor platting, Aisha tried to get to her target though 
the lightning storm. As her vision finally faded, she vowed to make 
the man pay for hurting Suzie.
      Khan looked at the two women thoughtfully before turning to the 
lightning projectors.
      &quot;Hmmm...the Catarl took a much higher voltage then was 
anticipated, yes much higher.&quot; He looked at Aisha with raised brows 
before shaking his head, &quot;A shame I will not get the chance to run 
tests on her now.&quot; The scientists sighed in resignation as two combat 
robots entered the lab, each taking a woman in a different direction. 
Khan smiled to himself as they left before heading after one.

***

      &quot;So this is the great Twilight Suzuka?&quot;
      &quot;Yes, Master.&quot;
      The words slowly made their way through the stuffiness within 
Suzuka&#39;s head as she became aware of her surroundings.
      &quot;She is said to be the greatest sword-wielder in known space?&quot;
      &quot;Yes, Master.&quot;
      She focused on the voices without giving any sign that she was 
conscious. One, the one who was actually speaking, was male; gruff 
and deep with a touch of madness. The other was a great deal softer 
and distinctly feminine. Quite a pleasant voice, she thought if she 
would say more then two words that is.
      &quot;I will defiantly look forward to killing her with my blade.&quot;
      &quot;Yes, Master.&quot;
      That will be the day, Suzuka thought, just keep talking fool, I 
will wipe the floor with you. However, there was the sound of 
footfalls on steel, followed by the hiss of a door opening and 
closing. Suzuka&#39;s eyes opened to an empty room, steel walls unbroken 
except for a door and two small vents. Suzuka easily slid into a 
seiza and contemplated her situation. There was no sign of Aisha, her 
sword or an obvious way out. The assassin smiled slightly, she had 
been in worse. 
      As she was running plans through her head, the door opened, 
revealing a poorly disguised Melfina. Suzuka blinked in honest 
confusion before realizing the girl just looked a lot like the shy 
navigator, with the exception of the shock of red hair on her head. 
The girl wore little more then a gold bikini with slippers on her 
feet. She hesitated on seeing the assassin awake before entering the 
cell.
      &quot;You&#39;re already awake? The Professor said you would be out for 
more then an hour.&quot; Suzuka raised a brow a coldly regarded the girl. 
She fidgeted nervously under her gaze for several seconds before 
speaking again, this time in a rush.
      &quot;Please you must help me leave here. I am a Security agent of 
Blue Heaven. I need to get back and report my findings.&quot;
      &quot;And the reason you can&#39;t do this yourself is...?&quot; The girl 
winced and lowered her head, shame coloring her cute features.
      &quot;I&#39;m supposed to be one of his almost mindless sex dolls.&quot;
      Suzuka nodded, her face expressionless, as she ruthlessly 
pushed down her sympathy, at lest for now. &quot;And the reason you are 
not?&quot;
      &quot;We thought something like this would happen, two of the 
incidents connected to Gabriel involved brainwashed civilians.&quot; The 
redhead looked at Suzuka, tears glistening unshed in her eyes. &quot;I 
received hypnoses before taking the job, once I was inside and 
&#39;converted&#39;, I would be just like the others until I saw a way out. 
At that point, the hypnoses would restore my mind to me and I was to 
escape.&quot;
      Suzuka&#39;s eyes focused intently on the girl&#39;s for several 
seconds before she nodded.  &quot;Take me to my sword and my partner.&quot;

***

      Suzuka followed the girl, who finally introduced herself as 
Inspector Rashel, through the maze that was the upper level of 
Gabriel&#39;s base. After reacquiring her bokken, the dark-haired woman 
felt a great deal more confident on their chances of success. Now all 
she had to worry about was getting Aisha.
      &quot;Through here.&quot; Rashel said, opening a door and waking the 
assassin through.
      She nodded and stepped into the room, and saw that she had been 
set-up. The man was not terribly tall, about the same as Gene&#39;s 
friend Fred, but he was very well muscled. As was evidenced by his 
lack of a shirt, just a leather strap holding a sword sheathed to his 
back. Fur lined leather boots had a simple pair of black pants tucked 
into them. The man&#39;s smile was wide and his green eyes sparkled with 
insanity.
      &quot;I have brought her as you requested Master.&quot; Rashel blandly 
spoke, the life that was in her voice before gone. He smiled at the 
girl and nodded, as though to a pet that had pleased its owner.
      &quot;Very good 23. Leave now, and have this recorded.&quot; He commanded 
her be for giving Suzuka a wink. &quot;I may want to watch this again.&quot; 
Suzuka watch Rashel leave from the corner of her eye before focusing 
on the man in front of her. 
      &quot;A very convincing story you had her tell.&quot; Suzuka said, 
mentally reading herself.
      Gabriel&#39;s smile widened. &quot;It wasn&#39;t a story,&quot; he informed her. 
&quot;She really is an inspector for Blue Heaven. The only part that was 
false was her &#39;release key.&#39;&quot;
      Suzuka frowned as Gabriel drew his blade, the light reflected 
off the polished steel of the European-style long sword. She raised 
her bokken and slid a foot forward, facing him and waiting. The door 
slid shut behind Rashel as Gabriel started to circle his prey, the 
metal blade lazily spinning around him.
      &quot;I have heard of you, Suzuka.&quot; He told her pleasantly, &quot;You&#39;re 
the best assassin in the business and master with a blade. I have 
wondered how long you would last against me.&quot;
      &quot;Not too long I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Suzuka smirked, &quot;You probably won&#39;t 
even be a decent work-out.&quot; The smile vanished from the terrorist&#39;s 
face as he charged forward with a snarl of animal fury.
      Suzuka stepped back and brought her bokken up to parry the 
uncontrolled blow. She shifted their still locked blades left, 
overextending his reach. Suzuka spun as fast as she could while 
dropping to one knee, bringing her bokken cutting across the man&#39;s 
exposed stomach before jumping back. Gabriel grunted, a thin line of 
blood appearing, and brought his sword back into position before 
thrusting at the just landed woman. The wooden blade slapped the 
steel one off-target but Gabriel was prepared this time, as his 
momentum carried him closer, he lifted a knee into Suzuka&#39;s side, 
knocking the air out of her.
      Leaning with the blow to try to minimize the damage, Suzuka 
staggered back, deflecting another blow from the sword as she 
retreated. Gabriel allowed her to back away with a smirk as he 
twirled his sword.
      &quot;It seems this &#39;work-out&#39; is a bit much for you. Not as easy as 
you thought it would be, hmmm?&quot; Suzuka glared at the man before 
snapping her blade diagonally up, sending a shockwave at the sneering 
terrorist, and following in its wake.
      Gabriel held his sword up allowing the wave crashing against 
its length without effect, then dropped into a thrust stance. The 
blade flashed golden before a sphere of energy slammed into Suzuka, 
sending her tumbling to the sound of Gabriel&#39;s cold laughter.
      &quot;What&#39;s the matter Suzuka? I thought you were the best.&quot; He 
continued to laugh as Suzuka picked herself up.
      Her eyes narrowed, Suzuka studied Gabriel briefly before 
smiling. &quot;It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve had to use the advanced 
techniques mother taught me,&quot; she thought. &quot;Time to show this 
arrogant male the full power of the Dark Blade school.&quot; Suzuka stood 
tall, her blade pointing at the ground beside her and a small smile 
on her lips. Gabriel stopped laughing and blinked in mild puzzlement. 
With a deep roar of displaced air, Suzuka ran at him, covering the 
distance in a heartbeat.
      Suzuka slashed upwards at close to the sound barrier, fully 
expecting to see Gabriel fall over on both sides. However, the steel 
blade intercepted the wooden blade, forcing Gabriel back several 
feet, but leaving him unharmed. The swordswoman frowned briefly 
before starting an attack at the same speed as the previous one. As 
each strike was blocked with increasing ease, Suzuka felt a cold ball 
settle within her. 
      There was another flash of gold, and suddenly Suzuka found 
herself on the defensive against attacks that moved even faster then 
hers had. She pulled back, hoping to get some breathing room when a 
thrust broke her guard. Pain flared in her arm as Gabriel&#39;s sword 
pierced it. Taking advantage of his opponent&#39;s lapse, Gabriel lashed 
out with a vicious kick, throwing her back against the wall with a 
resounding crack before she slumped to her hands and knees.
      Through pain-blurred vision, Suzuka saw Gabriel walk toward 
her, his blade still red with her blood. It took her several seconds 
to realize her was speaking.
      &quot;...ka, Suzuka, Suzuka. What a disappointment, but don&#39;t take 
it too badly, your skills were very impressive.&quot; He smiled 
condescendingly at her, &quot;But in the end, they just weren&#39;t enough. 
Unsurprising really, after all,&quot; Gabriel held his blade before him 
and smiled at it, &quot;you don&#39;t have a weapon like this.&quot;
      Suzuka&#39;s eyes went wide as a golden light enveloped the blade, 
seeing it and finally noticing it, she gasped. &quot;A Soul Edge?&quot;
      Gabriel looked impressed as he nodded. &quot;Quite. I am very 
surprised that you know how to tell, the last Soul Edge vanished more 
then two hundred years ago.&quot; The whimsical smile retuned to his face, 
&quot;It is very fortuitists that the Professor learned how to make them 
where ever it was he was at.&quot; Like a switch, his smile vanished and 
he raised the blade. &quot;Enough talk! Twilight Suzuka, now you die.&quot;
      Golden light filled her vision as the blade descended.

***

      Aisha opened her eyes slowly and gently shook her head to try 
to relieve the pounding. Focusing on her surroundings, she was 
surprised to find herself on the Outlaw Star just outside of the 
bridge. A deep hum, felt more then heard, filled the passageway, 
telling her the ship was traveling through sub-ether. She entered the 
bridge to find Gene, Jim and Melfina piloting the ship.
      &quot;Hey guys!&quot; She called, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;
      Silence answered her as the other three continued as though she 
had said nothing.
      &quot;Um... Gene?&quot; Aisha waved a hand an inch from the pilot&#39;s eyes 
with no response from him.
      &quot;Say Gene,&quot; Jim started, &quot;You never did say what you wanted 
done with Aisha&#39;s stuff.&quot; Gene looked up from his controls and 
shrugged.
      &quot;Space it. It&#39;s not like we need them.&quot; Aisha blinked and 
looked at Gene in shock.
      &quot;What?! Hey that&#39;s my stuff!&quot; Jim nodded.
      &quot;Gotch ya. It sure is nice around here without her isn&#39;t it?&quot;
      &quot;Jim?&quot; Aisha looked at the boy in disbelief.
      &quot;No kidding,&quot; Gene nodded. &quot;That stupid animal was quite the 
pain. Maybe now we can get our jobs done correctly.&quot;
      &quot;H-hey...&quot;
      &quot;Yes,&quot; Melfina agreed cheerfully, &quot;And now I won&#39;t have to 
worry about buying new dishes whenever she ruins them with one of her 
so-called &#39;meals.&#39;&quot;
      &quot;Mel? Wha...?&quot;
      &quot;So Jim,&quot; Gene asked, &quot;What is this major job you got for us 
anyway?&quot;
      Jim turned around and gave the red-haired man a wide grin. &quot;Oh 
I think you&#39;ll like it.&quot; He told them, &quot;We get to hunt down the 
Catarl Catarl race. Galactic Senate placed a bounty on every member; 
soon the &#39;great Catarl Catarl Empire&#39; will be nothing more then a bad 
memory.&quot;
      &quot;Alright!&quot; Gene pumped a fist. &quot;We&#39;re finally getting rid of 
the damn cats.&quot; The three laughed and returned to their jobs with new 
cheer as Aisha stared at them, her mouth open as she slowly backed 
into the corridor.
      As the doors closed behind her, Aisha turned and ran to the 
back of the ship. She found Suzuka sitting at the galley table, 
nursing a cup of tea.
      &quot;Suzie! Please tell me you can hear me!&quot;
      The assassin did not respond with words, but she did look up at 
the catwoman with a raised eyebrow. Aisha almost fell over in relief.
      &quot;You gotta help me,&quot; She ran to the table and grabbed her arm. 
&quot;The others are talking crazy and are pretending they can&#39;t see or 
hear me!&quot;
      Suzuka looked at Aisha in silence for a few seconds before 
turning back to her tea and finishing it. She rose to her feet and 
walked to the sink, Aisha watched her with a sinking sensation. As 
the tall woman rinsed her cup out, she finally spoke.
      &quot;Of course they can&#39;t hear you Aisha. You are dead after all.&quot;
      &quot;Huh? Dead? How?&quot;
      &quot;Like this!&quot; Aisha turned around at the voice to see Gene, his 
Caster pointed at her and a small black sphere just in front of it. 
The sphere shot forward at Aisha and black lightning wrapped around 
her form. Aisha screamed as she felt her body pulled in to the orb. 
The pain suddenly ended and she staggered back as her vision cleared. 
Gene was standing by the door, Caster on his shoulder and a satisfied 
smile on his face, he stood there for a few more seconds before 
turning around and leaving. Suzuka followed him, but turned at the 
door to look at Aisha once more.
      &quot;What? Did you actually think any of us could love something 
like you?&quot;
      Aisha feel to her knees, absently noting that she could see 
through her body, as thought she was a hologram... or a ghost. Suzuka 
gave the fallen warrior a final, contemptuous, glance before leaving 
the galley. Aisha held out a shacking hand to her retreating form.
      &quot;Suzie? Suzuka? Please don&#39;t leave me!&quot;
      A change in the ships hum, the rising of her neck hairs and the 
sudden sense of dread, was her only warning as the walls of the 
Outlaw Star vanished, replaced by blackness. A blackness cut by a 
single cold and unforgiving voice.
      &quot;Aisha Clanclan.&quot;
      She slowly turned her head in the direction of the voice. As 
she turned, the darkness pulled back. High walls of stone, going up 
more then a hundred feet with long tapestries of the eighteen Clan&#39;s 
sigils surrounded her. Before the walls were tiers seating her 
people, all of whom were gazing at her without expression. At the far 
end of the hall, before a great statue of the god of the Catarl 
Catarl, stood an imposing podium of bloodstone, the Great Sigil of 
the Empire carved into it. Gazing at her over crossed hands was a 
blonde male Catarl Catarl warrior in the robes of a Judicator and 
blue tattoos on his face similar too... Aisha gasped as she looked 
above the man to the statue behind him, a statue of him.
      &quot;Aisha Clanclan,&quot; Rio Larga, God of the Catarl Catarl said 
again, &quot;You have come before me to petition the worthiness of your 
life.&quot; Aisha swallowed and rose to her feet, determined not to show 
any weakness.
      &quot;Oh great Rio Larga, god of the Catarl Catarl. I have lived by 
the path you have set for your children and the way of the warrior 
for my life...&quot;
      &quot;Liar!&quot; Aisha started and looked into the tiers for the voice. 
Rio Larga lazily turned his head and acknowledged the speaker.
      &quot;Speak Sylven Greenpath.&quot; The tall woman stood and bowed to Rio 
Larga before turning a glare to Aisha.
      &quot;You claim to have followed the way of the warrior, and yet you 
allowed yourself to be seen thusly?!&quot; She waved to the entrance 
behind Aisha and a large image of Aisha in a waitress&#39; uniform 
appeared. The crowd began to mutter, disapproval plain to hear. Aisha 
looked around as she tried to be heard.
      &quot;I had no choice! The worlds outside Catarl Catarl have no 
respect for our abilities or status; I needed money to attain what I 
required!&quot;
      &quot;And so you served the weak Humans food?&quot; Sylven sneered, &quot;Did 
you offer them other &#39;services&#39; as well?&quot; Aisha flushed as she glared 
at the warrior.
      &quot;No, I did not! What would you&#39;ve had me do?!&quot; She demanded. 
Sylven adopted a mock thoughtful expression.
      &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know, maybe something like what this one did?&quot; The 
image changed again, to one of Suzuka walking out of the bounty 
collection office. &quot;I believe she traveled with you quite a bit 
recently. Any reason you left the warrior&#39;s work to her?&quot; Aisha 
flushed harder but was unable to come up with a reply.
      &quot;Time after time,&quot; Sylven continued, &quot;you have allowed this 
human to show you up. A HUMAN! Some representative of the mighty 
Catarl Catarl YOU turned out to be.&quot; The muttering in the tiers 
became louder. &quot;Tell us Aisha, why did you let this woman surpass 
you?&quot; Aisha opened her mouth, but nothing would come out. She tried 
again with the same results. Sylven sneered at her, disgust clear in 
her eyes. &quot;I shall tell you why.&quot; The blue-haired Catarl Catarl 
looked at those around her, &quot;Honored Ancients, great Rio Larga, the 
one known as Aisha of the House Clanclan feels an attraction to the 
human woman.&quot;
      Aisha stood dumbfounded as the room erupted in arguments. 
Numerous Houses turned on the representatives of the House Clanclan 
and demanded how they allowed such a weakness to enter their 
bloodline. As her own family denied her, withdrawing their support 
and casting her from the House, Aisha dared to look at Rio Larga. Her 
god was watching her, paying no mind to the clamoring Ancients.
      Finally, Rio Larga struck the stone podium, the crack echoing 
throughout the chamber, silencing the others. As the last fell quiet, 
the blonde god spoke.
      &quot;Aisha, the charges against you are grave indeed.&quot; Aisha 
winced, noticing the lack of family name. &quot;How ever, you can redeem 
your honor.&quot; He leaned forward, fixing Aisha with his gaze. &quot;Deny all 
ties to these humans, cast them from your heart and embrace the 
superiority of the Catarl Catarl race once more.&quot;
      Aisha lowered her eyes, remaining silent for several seconds. 
When she raised her eyes, tears shimmered within their emerald 
depths. &quot;During my time with them, I have witnessed many amazing 
things and I have been part of epic battles. Their lives have been 
entrusted to me on more then one occasion. Just as mine has been in 
theirs. I can not just let these memories go. I apologize, oh great 
God of the Catarl Catarl, but I can not do as you say.&quot;
      Dead silence followed in the wake of Aisha&#39;s speech as all eyes 
turned to Rio Larga, awaiting his decision. His face expressionless, 
Rio Larga nodded.
      &quot;You have made your choice Aisha, and I respect your commitment 
to it. But by that choice, you have forsaken the ways of the Catarl 
Catarl.&quot; He stood, followed shortly by the rest of the hall. &quot;This is 
the final decision of this court. Aisha, formerly of the House 
Clanclan, you are here by... forgotten.&quot; With that, Rio Larga turned 
and left, not once looking back.
      &quot;Forgotten... forgotten... forgotten.&quot; The voices of the 
Ancients echoed around her.
      &quot;Forgotten... forgotten... forgotten.&quot; Everyone Aisha had ever 
meet appeared before her to speak that one word, until finally, only 
four remained.
      &quot;Forgotten...&quot; Gene left.
      &quot;Forgotten...&quot; Jim left.
      &quot;Forgotten...&quot; Melfina left.
      Suzuka stepped forward and gazed impassively at Aisha before 
she nodded and turned away, her voice hanging in the sudden emptiness 
around her. &quot;Forgotten...&quot;

***

      &quot;Forgotten...&quot;
      Professor Khan glanced up from the display he was watching. The 
Catarl Catarl woman was responding well to his treatments. The neural 
interrupt band blocked all sensory data and motor functions save for 
what he allowed. He adjusted the settings slightly and began to move 
to stage two. The main personality has been driven into submission, 
now all he had to do was make a shell identity to satisfy the crude 
barbarian he was allied with. For now anyway.
      A panel chimed for his attention, one that should not have gone 
off. Khan walked to the display, mild curiosity was soon replaced by 
his full attention.
      &quot;My, my. This is a surprise. Yes, yes a surprise.&quot; It looked 
like the partnership would be ending sooner then first expected. Khan 
began typing, moving all of his work onto the computer of the small 
craft keep in the launch bay. Through out the base, the remaining 
combat robots stopped their assignments and started to put as much of 
the resources as the ship could hold on.
      On the table behind him, Aisha continued to experience nothing 
as, without the command, stage two never began.

***

      There was a flash of golden light, followed by thunder filling 
the room. Gabriel was used to this, it had happened when he killed 
others with Excalibur. So used to it was he, that he didn&#39;t see the 
impossible at first. His grin slowly slipped off his face to be 
replaced by total bafflement.
      &quot;This is not possible.&quot;
      The Soul Edge Excalibur, it&#39;s golden shine of full power 
bathing the room, was being held fast by the flat of a simple wooden 

bokken held by an assassin. Suzuka smiled coldly, her eyes glittering 
viciously.
      &quot;Surprise.&quot; She surged to her feet, pushing Gabriel onto his 
backside. Suzuka watched as he scrambled backwards, standing straight 
and proud.
      &quot;You said it yourself,&quot; She told him as he finally got his feet 
under him. &quot;The last Soul Edge vanished more then two hundred years 
ago.&quot; Gabriel rose to his feet slowly as Suzuka reached into her 
kimono. She pulled out a small disc with a hole in the center just 
about the size of...
      Suzuka smiled as she saw the faint glimmerings of understanding 
in his eyes before it was crushed by his insanity and denial. She 
calmly slid the tip thru the hole and down its length until the hilt 
locked into place.
      &quot;A clan of assassins recovered it and swore to keep it safe for 
all time.&quot; The wooden sword began to vibrate, cracks appearing on its 
surface, a cool blue-white light emanating from them.

               -Rinbu Revolution, Shoujo Kakumei Utena-

      &quot;For the last four generations, my family has succeeded in it&#39;s 
vow.&quot; Suzuka gave him a soft smile, &quot;But I think my ancestors will 
forgive me this once.&quot; She held the blade above her head and the last 
of the wood exploded off. &quot;Once more must Masamune shine in this 
universe.&quot; Icy light trailed from the polished katana as Suzuka once 
more assumed a ready stance.
      &quot;Round two.&quot;  
      Gabriel&#39;s breathing became loud and heavy as he wiped his 
mouth, focused only on Suzuka, he charged with a wordless sound of 
fury. Suzuka stepped aside and calmly slapped Excalibur away. The two 
Soul Edges meet with a muted thunderclap, a shockwave flashing 
outwards from the point of contact as jagged bolts of energy scored 
the ground.
      Gabriel continued for several steps before spinning and 
bringing his golden blade down in a strike that could cleave a 
starship&#39;s hull clean thru. Suzuka deflected it with Murasame and, as 
Excalibur bit into the station floor smoothly, brought it across his 
chest. The sword harness vanished in a burst of pale blue energy as 
she gave Gabriel a two inch cut. 
      Suzuka frowned as she saw not blood, but golden light spill 
from the cut. The lores her family had on the Soul Edge said it would 
keep its wielder from harm as long as it had the energy to. She had 
expected the result, Masamune had already healed her own wound after 
all; but she had hoped Professor Khan&#39;s version was not as well made. 
It looked like she would have to do this the hard way.
      Reversing the blade, Suzuka blocked another stroke as she moved 
backwards. Gabriel pursued her, hacking all the while. Suzuka studied 
Gabriel&#39;s movements as she blocked each strike. A corner of her mind 
absently noted that the two of them were moving incredibly fast. The 
charred remains of Masamune&#39;s disguise was still falling from the air 
on the other side of the room. A fragment from the scrolls came back 
to her as she saw this.
      &quot;The wielder of a Soul Edge moves with thought.&quot; An idea formed 
in the back of her mind. Suzuka jumped into the air, impossibly high, 
and moved across the room as soon as she willed herself there. Seeing 
the success of her idea, Suzuka turned and waited, every ounce of her 
attention on Gabriel. He was thrown off balance when she had jumped, 
but recovered by the time she turned. Spinning, he saw his target and 
yelled in frustration, Excalibur&#39;s glow brightening.
      Suzuka tensed.
      Gabriel held his blade beside him then thrust it forward, a 
sphere of golden energy flashing out of it.
      She moved.
      Almost a decade ago, her family took a student from outside of 
the family. Hitoriga proved to be quite adept at their style, and an 
excellent partner for a young Suzuka. As he trained, Hitoriga became 
obsessed with the beauty always facing him across the dojo floor. He 
envisioned claiming her and making her his, along with the school. 
One day, he followed her to a forest glade, there he saw his woman in 
the arms on another woman. His dreams crushed, Hitoriga wondered the 
forest. Hours later, he saw the other woman alone, and a red haze 
fell over his vision. As the red haze faded a little, he found 
himself back at the school, the blood of her family on his hands.
      When Suzuka discovered what he had done, she developed a single 
attack, designed to kill the one who killed her family. She found the 
chance to use it once, and her family was avenged. Now, she found 
another chance to use it. Boosted by Masamune, Suzuka ran by the 
blast and used Crimson once more.
      Her enhanced senses felt Excalibur try to heal Gabriel, but she 
was already moving again. Spinning and stepping forward, Suzuka 
separated Excalibur from it&#39;s wielder, at the elbow. No longer 
connected to a mind, the golden glow faded as Gabriel dropped, the 
life gone from his eyes.
      Behind her, several pieces of wood landed.

***

      Crouched among several storage containers, Suzuka watched as 
three combat robots loaded supplies into a small spacecraft. Judging 
by some of the other objects that had been loaded, the assassin 
guessed that Professor Khan was taking his leave of Heaven&#39;s 
Vengeance. While she didn&#39;t care if that was so or not, the old crack 
pot scientist was the only one who could take her to Aisha, as she 
would be damned if she let him do anything else first.
      The warning came a second before the shot, but with Masamune 
active, that second was enough. Suzuka blocked the energy bolt and 
was already moving at the shooter before she even recognized the 
redhead holding the gun. Pulling her arm back at the last instant, 
the raven haired woman destroyed the pistol instead of Rashel. As the 
woman stumbled back from the exploding gun, Suzuka grabbed her left 
arm and wrenched it behind her back, forcing Rashel to her knees with 
a pained cry.
      Suzuka frowned at the woman, she didn&#39;t think any of the women 
that Gabriel had in his little harem would have had enough initiative 
to seek her out. She glanced about, hoping to find something to tie 
the woman up with. Suzuka was again surprised when Rashel&#39;s foot 
kicked out, knocking her own out from under her.
      As her arm was released, the former Inspector tried to grab 
Suzuka&#39;s neck. She had wasted several minutes after seeing her Master 
killed by this woman before her shell personality decided on a course 
of action, to kill her in return.
      Twisting as she fell, Suzuka saw Rashel&#39;s hands reach for her 
neck. Too late to knock them away before she hit the deck, Suzuka 
allowed the slim hands by, grabbing her wrists the second her arms 
finished absorbing the shock form the fall. The assassin was startled 
by the diminutive woman&#39;s strength and began to worry when the 
shiatsu points she hit had no effect.
      Desperately trying to get some leverage, Suzuka rolled the two 
of them over. Her vision was starting to fade when there was a flash 
of light, and suddenly, she could breath again. Coughing several 
times, she waited for her vision to return. When it did, she saw 
Rashel sitting against the containers wearing a confused and slightly 
scared expression.
      &quot;Are you okay? I didn&#39;t hurt you too badly did I?&quot; The red head 
asked. Suzuka rubbed her throat while studying the other woman before 
finally responding.
      &quot;I will be fine. I take it you no longer wish kill me?&quot; Rashel 
blinked at Suzuka several times before violently shacking her head.
      &quot;No. I... I&#39;m not sure how I was freed, but... no, I don&#39;t want 
to kill you.&quot;
      &quot;That&#39;s nice to know,&quot; She replied dryly.
      The two women slowly got to their feet, both looking for signs 
that their brief fight had attracted any unwanted attention. Seeing 
only the robots, still loading the spacecraft, Suzuka relaxed 
slightly before glancing at the floor for Masamune. Seeing the blade 
lying between herself and Rashel, Suzuka looked at it curiously. 
Deciding to shelve her question until a later time, Suzuka lifted the 
katana and turned to Rashel.
      &quot;Do you know where Aisha is?&quot; 
      &quot;Aisha is the Catarl Catarl woman with you?&quot; Seeing the raven 
haired woman&#39;s nod, Rashel bit her lip. &quot;She&#39;s... probably in the 
Professor&#39;s lab being... &#39;conditioned&#39; by him.&quot; Suzuka&#39;s eyes 
narrowed as thoughts of introducing Khan to some of her families more 
exotic, and painful, methods of killing flitted about her mind.
      &quot;Take me there.&quot;

***

      Finding the lab doors locked with a code Rashel did not have, 
Suzuka tried one of her own keys. The doors to the lab were bent then 
blasted inwards by the coolly angry assassin and her Soul Edge. 
Marching in, she saw the two lightning casters that had knocked her 
out before aiming at her. As the purple energy lanced toward her, she 
lift Masamune and reflected the bolts right back at the casters. The 
devices buzzed and sparked, the energy coursing along the frames 
before they both detonated in an impressive shower of sparks.
      Rashel blinked and looked at her. She didn&#39;t even see the other 
woman&#39;s arm move! Recalling what she saw, or rather didn&#39;t see, of 
her fight with Gabriel, Rashel swallowed. Seeing the room go from 
clean and polished to cracked, ripped and energy scored, literally, 
in a heartbeat, was a very sobering testament to the power her 
companion possessed.
      &quot;KHAN!&quot; Suzuka&#39;s voice echoed within the chamber without 
response.
      Suzuka looked around the darkened room before spotting the door 
on the left wall and heading to it, Rashel hurrying after the 
assassin. The door slide open without complaint, Suzuka was thru it 
before it finished.
      &quot;Aisha!&quot; Seeing the fierce woman laid on the table, her skin 
pale even thru her thin coat of fur, was almost too much of Suzuka.
      She hurried to her side, hand instantly at her neck to check 
for a pulse, as Rashel examined the displays. Suzuka sighed in relief 
upon feeling the soft but steady beat beneath her fingertips. Her 
immediate concern assuaged, Suzuka reached for the visor-like device 
wrapped around Aisha&#39;s head.
      &quot;Stop!&quot; Suzuka&#39;s hands froze as she looked at Rashel, not 
speaking but clearly wanting an answer.
      &quot;She&#39;s still in phase one, but according to these readings...&quot; 
The Inspector trailed off, looking very worried, before she resumed. 
&quot;She&#39;s been at the end phase one for almost thirty minutes.&quot;
      &quot;What dose phase one mean?&quot; Suzuka demanded.
      &quot;Phase one is personality submergence.&quot; Rashel closed her eyes, 
painful memories floating far to close to the surface of her mind 
then she liked. &quot;The subject&#39;s ego is undermined, resulting in a near 
comatose state that aids in the formation of a &#39;shell personality&#39; 
while the core personality has retreated from the outside world.&quot;
      Suzuka was impressed with the girl in front of her, she was 
obviously reliving a very painful time, yet it was not interfering 
with her duty. The tall woman walked silently over to Rashel and 
placed a comforting hand her shoulder.
      &quot;How do I stop it?&quot; Rashel shock her head.
      &quot;It&#39;s too late, Aisha&#39;s personality has been driven to 
submission, if... if we stop it now, she&#39;ll be comatose.&quot;
      &quot;How can I bring her back then?&quot;
      &quot;The professor... the professor likes... the method he used on 
me was... was being forgotten...&quot;
      &quot;Forgotten?&quot; Rashel nodded.
      &quot;I overheard him telling Mas... um... Gabriel once that 
sentients defined themselves by their interactions with others, the 
only way to truly kill someone was to remove all trace that they 
existed in the first place. In... our case, that was our memories of 
others. Aisha... Aisha is at the end of phase one, she currently 
believes that no one knows her. That is what this machine dose, it 
creates a world based on the... subjects own memories and strips them 
from her, leaving her with nothing.&quot;
      &quot;Where is Khan?&quot; Suzuka demanded. Rashel looked around, as thou 
the scientist were hiding in a corner.
      &quot;He should be here, especially if Aisha is in this thing.&quot; 
Suzuka walked over to a set of displays.
      &quot;Can you get an image of the hanger?&quot; Rashel looked at the 
keypad and typed a few commands. Soon, the display in front of the 
assassin blinked to life. Rashel looked up after hearing Suzuka swore 
softly. Glancing at the display, she saw why. The ship was gone.
      &quot;The bastard already left!&quot; Rashel hit the counter.
      &quot;A rat always knows when the ship is sinking.&quot;
      Suzuka lowered her head; a reflection off Masamune caught her 
eye. Heading back to Aisha, she placed the blade in her hand. Rashel 
looked on silently before finally speaking.
      &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Suzuka sighed and retrieved the blade.
      &quot;Failing, apparently. I think Masamune is what freed you 
earlier.&quot;
      Rashel blinked.  &quot;The sword freed me?&quot;
      &quot;One of the properties of a Soul Edge is that it heals the one 
touching the handle. When we rolled over, I think you touched it and 
it healed you.&quot; Rashel thought about that before nodding
      &quot;That makes sense. But in my case, I was actively fighting 
against the shell personality. It must have found the conflict inside 
me and removed the shell personality. Aisha doesn&#39;t have a shell yet 
thou, there was no conflict for it to heal.&quot;
      &quot;I know, but I had to try anyway.&quot;
      Rashel nodded, bending back to the console and trying to find a 
way to help Aisha.
      Suzuka gazed at the Catarl Catarl woman, her hand slowly 
running thru her white hair. Memories of their times together 
flashing through her mind. As her eyes drifted to the device keeping 
her in a false world, she thought about what Rashel said. Then she 
noticed a second band hung on a hook next to the bed.
      &quot;Rashel...&quot; The red head looked up.
      &quot;Yes?&quot;
      &quot;What if she was told there was someone who remembered her in 
there?&quot; Rashel&#39;s eyes narrowed as she thought.
      &quot;It... I suppose that might work... but the program can&#39;t be 
altered while it&#39;s running.&quot; Suzuka faced her, a fire burning in her 
dark gaze.
      &quot;So send me in.&quot; She said pointing to the second band.
