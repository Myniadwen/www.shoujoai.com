<h1>At First Glance (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../outlawstar/index.html">Outlaw Star</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kmiller.html">Liliandra</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Twilight Suzuka. Known throughout the galaxy as one of the most deadly
assassins in the business. Once she takes a job, it can be considered
done, as long as you can pay. She is known for striking precisely at
sunset, hence her name. None of her targets have anything to fear 
until that time. 

But little else is known about this beautiful assassin. It has been 
said recently that she has joined as crew for a private star ship, but 
these rumors are unconfirmed.

What drives this woman? 

Dose she search for something? Or someone?

What secrets lie within her heart?

------------------------------------------------------------

Aboard the star craft known as the Outlaw Star, five people, each with 
different pasts, work together to get through the endless expanse of 
space. In the cockpit, Gene Starwind, the de facto captain, sat in the 
central seat, looking over the various indicators of the ship. A tall 
man with a wild shock of red hair, he smiled to himself as he looked 
about the cabin.

In front of him was the ship&#39;s chief, and only, engineer, Jim Hawking. 
Many would have called Gene insane for giving such an important 
position to a 10 year old boy, but Gene had known the young boy for a 
long time and the two had been through much together. Jim may still be 
waiting puberty, but all who knew the duo could and would swear that 
he was the mature one. Also in charge of the ships&#39; and the crews, 
finances, Jim was often planning ahead, since Gene would not. Gene 
smiled to himself, he didn&#39;t say so often, but he like the boy, and 
would not still be alive if not for him.

The outlaw did not need to turn around to know that Melfina, the ships 
navigator was in her interface tube. An artificially constructed 
being, Mel was often besieged with questions of the meaning of her 
existence. When she wasn&#39;t floating naked in the tube, a sight Gene 
often tried to ignore for the good of his blood pressure, the girl 
could usually be found in the kitchen, preparing meals for everyone.

A flash of black to his right reminded him of the elegant woman seated 
at ships systems. Twilight Suzuka moved with a clam sense of purpose 
in everything she did, making the simplest of movements graceful. One 
would never be able to guess from looking that she was also one of the 
most dangerous assassins in the galaxy. Thou she had not taken any 
such assignments for some time, she often provided a boost the Outlaw 
Stars&#39; funds by doing some bounty hunting at the various places they 
stopped at. Gene allowed himself a small smirk at the thought of the 
only time she ever failed an assignment.

A small noise to the left, a happily repeated &#39;meow&#39;, reminded him of 
the Outlaw Star&#39;s most annoying, in his opinion, crew member. Aisha 
Clanclan, the only non-human on board, was a Catarl Catarl, a race of 
felinoids with a fierce reputation as fighters. Gene had seen her in 
action enough times, more then once against himself, to know the truth 
behind the reputation to be, if anything, understated. He suppressed 
the urge to tell her to shut up as she tapped away at her station, 
sensors, knowing that it would only end with a long triad about the 
greatness of the Catarl Catarl, and herself in particular.

&quot;Blue Haven is within communication range.&quot; Gilliam, the Outlaw Star&#39;s 
computer informed them.

&quot;Alright Gilliam, open a link.&quot; Gene commanded.

&quot;Outlaw Star, this is Blue Haven Approach. Please state your purpose 
and the length of your stay.&quot; The soft, feminine voice of the Approach 
operator sounded over the speakers.

&quot;We read you Approach. This is Gene Starwind, captain of the Outlaw 
Star, we just need to resupply. We should only need about five days 
total.&quot;

&quot;Understood Captain Starwind, proceed on approach to hanger 12. 
Welcome to Blue Heaven.&quot;

Suzuka blocked Gene&#39;s voice as he tried to flirt with Approach; she 
had other things on her mind. A discreet use of the comm. array, 
easily overlooked thanks to Gene&#39;s ever reliable libido, got her in 
contact with Taki, her... friend at Blue Haven. The tall assassin had 
met the equally cool brunette years ago when one of her assignments 
coincided with Taki&#39;s. The man was apparently more disliked then 
either had thought. After completing the job, the two women had stayed 
in touch with each other over the years, meeting once or twice a year 
outside of business. Suzuka was never really sure who found out the 
others secret first, but one morning saw her waking with the other 
girl in her arms.

After a few days of tension, they reestablished their relationship to 
the others satisfaction. Though they never made more of their 
feelings, the two knew they would always have someone to be with. A 
few years ago, Taki had retired from field work and had taken a 
position in her clan at Blue Haven. She smiled when Taki&#39;s face 
appeared on her board.

&quot;Well, well. Suza-chan, I didn&#39;t expect to see you again so soon. What 
brings you back here?&quot; The Ninja Mistress smiled at her.

&quot;We&#39;re just passing though Taki-chan.&quot; Suzuka told her, &quot;We&#39;ll be in 
for a few days and I was wondering if you had some free... 
assignments.&quot;

Taki smirked and looked off-screen for a second before looking back. 
&quot;Well, I think I could come up with something. See you at the usual 
place?&quot;

The raven-haired woman nodded with a smile. &quot;I&#39;ll meet you there.&quot; She 
closed the link and resumed listening to her &#39;captain.&#39;

&quot;...on! I know of a great place near there, we can get a meal, go for 
a walk...&quot; Gene got no farther when Approach cut the link. Jim 
snickered.

&quot;Way to go Gene, you had her eating out of your palm alright.&quot;

Suzuka smiled and shock her head; she needed to get away from here as 
soon as they docked. All of them needed it she thought, as she 
prepared the ship of docking, especially after the near failure of 
their last job. Behind her, Aisha&#39;s ear twitched.

&quot;Hmmm, so Suzie has an assignment for herself. I think I&#39;ll follow 
her, maybe get the money myself. Hump, that&#39;ll show that stuck up 
human to look down on a Catarl Catarl warrior, especially Aisha 
Clanclan.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

THE JADE SERPENT

BLUE HEAVEN

To most of the people of Blue Heaven, the Jade Serpent was a great 
place to eat a quick but good meal. But to a few, those who had the 
right connections, it was a place to hire some of the best assassins 
in the quadrant. The ninja mistress of the area, a petite, slip of a 
girl named Taki, was often seen walking among the tables as the 
hostess of the restaurant. Those who were seeking something not on the 
menu would speak to this woman and, after a few days, their problem 
would be gone. Sometimes, a customer would not want to pay and, more 
then once, would assume Taki was just a pretty middle woman and try to 
force there way out. Those few usually found that the Ninja Mistress 
was just as capable as her field agents.

Twilight Suzuka walked in from the outside street and spotted Taki by 
the bar, after politely refusing a table from the waiter; she walked 
to the bar and ordered a green tea.

&quot;Suza-chan, so good to see you again.&quot; Taki smiled grasping the taller 
woman&#39;s shoulders and placing a kiss on both cheeks. Suzuka smiled and 
covered Taki&#39;s hands with her own.

&quot;As always, Taki-chan, it is a pleasure to see you as well.&quot; Suzuka 
smiled. &quot;Shall we go to a booth?&quot;

Taki nodded and the two women left the bar to head to the back of the 
restaurant where other business was often discussed. Suzuka allowed 
Taki to enter the booth first before sliding in after her. Once out of 
casual sight, Suzuka abandoned her normal aloofness and pulled the 
smaller woman against her, her lips seeking Taki&#39;s. When they pulled 
apart, both women were breathing faster. Taki gave Suzuka a small 
smile.

&quot;Well now, not that I&#39;m complaining, but what was that for?&quot; Suzuka 
gazed into her friend&#39;s eyes for several seconds before responding.

&quot;I have missed you Taki-chan, it&#39;s been harder then I thought to work 
with others again.&quot;

Taki looked at her old friend thoughtfully. She had rarely seen 
Suza-chan so upset, it was almost like... Taki blinked as a thought 
occurred to her.

&quot;So tell me what you&#39;ve been up to. Last I heard, you and the, Outlaw 
Star wasn&#39;t it, were in the Antiga system doing some job for a 
company.&quot;

Suzuka&#39;s mouth twisted into a frown as she remembered, &quot;Yes, a band of 
poachers was taking animals from the companies endangered species 
preserve. We cornered them in the mountains but that... animal... 
botched everything up and they got away. The only good thing about 
that escapade was that we got the animals back, so we got half of the 
reward money.&quot;

&quot;By &#39;animal&#39; I assume you mean that other woman, what was her name?&quot;

&quot;Aisha Clanclan, a Catarl Catarl. She&#39;s been something of a thorn in 
our sides for as long as she&#39;s been with us. She invited herself to 
join saying something to the effect that she owned the Outlaw Star.&quot; 
Taki raised an eyebrow, surprised at the level of emotion this woman 
could get out of her long-time friend and sometimes lover. &quot;So you 
this Aisha is the one responsible for the problem?&quot;

&quot;She has no sense of subtlety, no tact and most defiantly no sense of 
teamwork. She just walked right into the camp after we had already 
decided to sneak in. It was fortunate that the poachers were surprised 
by the stupid move enough so that the rest of us could get to her in 
time to prevent the whole mess from blowing up, literally.&quot; Taki 
recognized the signs of frustration from her long association with 
Suzuka and gave her a half-smile.

&quot;I see. So you actually wanted a real assignment then?&quot; Suzuka nodded.

&quot;Yes, I could us a chance to blow off some steam, a nice bounty hunt 
sounded like just the thing.&quot; The tall assassin smiled at the smaller 
one, &quot;That and spending some time with you.&quot; Taki smiled.

&quot;You flatter me.&quot; She pulled a small notepad from her vest and looked 
through it. &quot;Well is an outstanding bounty on a character calling 
himself Heaven&#39;s Vengeance or some such nonsense. He&#39;s managed to 
escape capture for a few months now, last I heard. He has a bunch of 
combat robots to do his biding, his &#39;Avenging Angels&#39; if I remember 
correctly.&quot; Suzuka blinked and smiled.

&quot;Sounds perfect. I just have to get by a dozen or so combat robots 
then?&quot;

Taki sweetdroped at the almost eager look in Twilight Suzuka&#39;s eyes. 
&quot;Um, yes about that, he had sixteen at the last report I got. I would 
recommend taking someone with you though.&quot;

&quot;No, there isn&#39;t anyone around here that I know well enough besides 
you that I would trust with watching my back.&quot;

&quot;Aw Suzie, I&#39;m hurt!&quot; A new voice intruded. Both women turned in 
surprise to look at a smugly grinning Aisha. &quot;After all we&#39;ve been 
through together. I would think that you would jump at the chance to 
work with Aisha Clanclan of the great Catarl Catarl Empire!&quot; Suzuka 
had paled when she had first seen the catwoman, but she recovered 
quickly and frowned at Aisha.

&quot;And why, pray tell, would I want to work with a beast like you?&quot; She 
asked scornfully.

Aisha growled her form swelling slightly with her anger. &quot;Who are you 
calling a beast? I&#39;ll have you know I can do anything you can do, but 
better. I&#39;ll bring in this bounty by tomorrow morning!&quot;

&quot;Please. This requires grace and subtlety, neither of which you have!&quot;

Taki had looked from one woman to the other through out their 
exchange, an idea forming in the back of her mind. With a smile, she 
slipped out the other side of the booth and stepped between the two. 
&quot;Now, now ladies, let&#39;s be civil about this.&quot; She turned to Aisha and 
leaned against the table as she gazed at the Catarl Catarl. &quot;I 
normally don&#39;t like to send an unknown on any of my assignments; I&#39;ll 
need to... test you.&quot; She told the woman.

&quot;Test me? No problem, bring it on. I&#39;ll beat your little test without 
breaking a sweat!&quot;

&quot;I was hoping you&#39;d say that.&quot; Taki purred, gliding right up to Aisha. 
Her arms wrapped around a startled Aisha&#39;s lightly furred neck. 
&quot;Hmm... I had heard that a Catarl Catarl&#39;s ears are sensitive,&quot; She 
whispered, one hand already tracing one.

Aisha suppressed a shiver as she tried to get her hear rate back down. 
&quot;I, I don&#39;t see what that has to with anything.&quot; She asked in a 
shaking voice. Suzuka&#39;s eyes were almost as wide as Aisha&#39;s at Taki&#39;s 
actions.

&quot;Taki, what are you doing? She&#39;s not like us.&quot; Aisha, her mind already 
whirling and confused by the unexpected touches, took Suzuka&#39;s 
statement in a way it was not intended.

&quot;What do you mean Suzie? I&#39;ll have you know I can do anything just as 
good as you!&quot; Taki smiled, that was too good a line to pass up.

&quot;Let&#39;s see about that.&quot; Without giving the other woman a chance to 
ask, the Ninja Mistress leaned up and claimed Aisha&#39;s lips with her 
own. Both Aisha&#39;s and Suzuka&#39;s eyes threatened to pop out of their 
heads, but soon, Aisha&#39;s emerald eyes had acquired a glaze as she was 
expertly kissed senseless. When Taki finally stepped back, Aisha 
continued to stand where she was, a blank look on her face. Suzuka, 
however, was not pleased.

&quot;Are you crazy Taki? Aisha is not interested in other women! We need 
to get out of here before she comes too, who knows what she&#39;ll do.&quot; 
She already had her bokken out and pointed at the stunned woman as she 
eased out of the booth. Aisha&#39;s body shuddered as she closed her eyes 
and lifted a trembling hand to her lips. Suzuka froze and moved 
between Taki and Aisha, determined to keep her friend safe. Aisha 
opened her eyes and glared around Suzuka.

&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Taki, having not moved since she finished 
kissing her, just smirked.

&quot;I said I would have to test you. Congratulations, you passed.&quot; Both 
crew women blinked and looked at Taki with almost identical 
expressions of shock.

&quot;That was your test?&quot;

&quot;What sort of test was that?&quot;

Taki leaned against the table and smiled at both women. &quot;My sort of 
test.&quot; She answered. &quot;So here&#39;s the deal. If one of you brings him in, 
I&#39;ll pay that one.&quot; She raised a finger to cut off both as she 
continued. &quot;However, if you both bring him in, I&#39;ll double the 
bounty.&quot;

&quot;Neow, how much is the bounty anyway?&quot;

&quot;One hundred thousand wong.&quot;

Aisha and Suzuka blinked at the smirking woman. &quot;A hundred thousand 
wong for one guy? What&#39;d he do? Kill a governor?&quot; Aisha asked 
incredulously.

&quot;Well no, but not for lack of trying.&quot; Taki replied. &quot;He made an 
attempt on the life of Governor Salvador about three weeks ago and 
four other incidents have been linked to him since then. The local 
defense forces are, as usual out here, less then useless so his 
Excellency made arrangements with me yesterday.&quot; Suzuka raised a brow.

&quot;The governor himself?&quot; Taki chuckled and shook her head.

&quot;No, it was through an intermediary, but I knew who he worked for. 
Can&#39;t have a notable political figure seen hiring assassins you know. 
How would that look at the next election?&quot; She answered with an amused 
smirk.

&quot;Hmmm... So where is this goof ball?&quot; Aisha demanded. Taki smiled 
wider at the impatient woman.

&quot;Last word was that he was in the Field, about thirty klicks out, on 
one of the lager rocks. He has an underground base built there. I&#39;ll 
have a sled and some suits ready for you in an hour. The sled will 
drop you off with a portable pulse beacon. When you finish or need to 
pull out, get to the surface and trigger it. It has a fifty second 
life, so you only get one shot at extraction. If you miss it, you&#39;re 
on your own.&quot;

Aisha blinked but said nothing, slightly thrown off by the formally 
cheerful, if sardonic, woman&#39;s change of demeanor. Suzuka merely 
nodded, used to dealing with Taki when she was in business mode. She 
was actually being more generous then usual, in most assignments like 
this, the beacon wouldn&#39;t be give. The assassin either succeeded or 
was killed.

&quot;I understand. I will be ready in thirty minutes.&quot;

&quot;Huh? Hey! You&#39;re not gunna get a head start on me Suzie! I&#39;m ready 
now!&quot; Aisha proudly told Taki, a thumb jabbed between her breasts and 
a smirk on her face. Suzuka sighed and rolled her eyes, causing Taki 
to smother a giggle.

&quot;Your eagerness is admirable my dear. But weather you&#39;re ready now or 
in thirty minutes, the sled won&#39;t be until an hour. Please, sit and 
enjoy a meal, on the house.&quot; Leaving the two with a bright smiles and 
a conspiratorial wink, though neither woman was sure why, the assassin 
mistress walked toward the kitchens. Aisha blinked and tilted her head 
with a soft &#39;neow&#39; before looking at Suzuka.

&quot;You know Suzie,&quot; She told her companion, &quot;You&#39;re friend is weird.&quot;

Suzuka glared at the Catarl warrior next to her before setting herself 
back in the booth. &quot;Kettle thou art black.&quot; She said, to Aisha&#39;s 
confusion, &quot;Besides, you have yet to explain why or how you are here.&quot; 
Aisha blinked and smiled, sliding opposite Suzuka.

&quot;Oh that was easy, I heard you talking to that woman before we pulled 
in and I decided to follow you and show you how a Catarl Cartarl 
warrior handles a bounty hunt.&quot; She told the other woman with pride. 
Suzuka blinked a few times before sighing again.

&quot;Only you would be proud of the fact that you eavesdropped.&quot; She 
mumbled. Not feeling like continuing the conversation, the dark-haired 
woman picked up a menu and began to decide on her meal.

Across from her, Aisha smiled a little wider before settling back with 
her own menu. Occasionally she would look over the top at the elegant 
woman she was sharing the table with. As usual, she felt a slight stab 
of envy toward the woman. She always projected such an aura of 
confidence and grace that Aisha sometimes wished she could have. 
Suppressing a sigh, the catwoman glanced back down to her menu, 
briefly wondering if this was such a good idea after all. 

------------------------------------------------------------

OUTSIDE BLUE HEAVEN

ONE HOUR LATER

As she promised, an hour later Aisha and her reluctant partner were 
bundled up in space suits, helmets resting beside them, and on there 
way in one of Blue Haven&#39;s small asteroid runners. Built to find 
asteroids with metals and ice, the small range space craft commonly 
referred to as sleds are not the most comfortable of craft for the 
pilot, let alone passengers. A fact both women were experiencing first 
hand as they tightly held the handgrips to keep from floating away in 
freefall. Their meal having been eaten in silence, with the exception 
of Aisha&#39;s &#39;vigorous&#39; eating habits, the two women waited by the small 
craft docks for Taki&#39;s sled driver, an old man named Kuan, to finish 
fueling his craft.

&quot;Ya ready back dar?&quot; Kuan&#39;s voice called over the intercom, &quot;Ah&#39;m o&#39;er 
da drop point.&quot;

Aisha was a second behind Suzuka in getting her helmet on and sealed, 
seeing her fitted, Suzuka hit the bulkhead behind her with the metal 
pipe Kuan had given them for the purpose of signaling when they were 
ready.

&quot;All&#39;s rig&#39;t &#39;en.&quot; He called back. &quot;G&#39;luk!&quot; With that, the floor hatch 
opened, showing a small asteroid five meters below them. Letting go, 
the two women used maneuvering thrusters to drop to the rock. The 
sled, doors already closing, was pulling away almost before they 
cleared it.

Inside the cockpit, Kuan smiled to himself as he angled the sled back 
toward the docks. &quot;I hope Mistress Taki was right about you two 
ladies.&quot; He said, all trace of the rough spacers speech gone, &quot;I&#39;ll be 
watching for your signal. Be careful.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

It took almost an hour for Suzuka to find an asteroid similar to the 
one Taki had told them about. During that hour, she reminded herself 
exactly why it was she hated space walks. She signaled Aisha, once 
again cursing that the suit had no radios, over from the other side of 
the floating rock they were on and together expended the last of their 
fuel on the jump to the likely rock holding the base of Heaven&#39;s 
Vengeance.

According to the small display on her left arm, she had about fifteen 
minutes of air left. Suzuka narrowed her eyes and frowned, they needed 
to find his base soon or else signal for pick up and abandon the 
entire job. The idea of abandoning a job did not sit well with the 
dark-haired woman so she pushed the countdown to the back of her mind 
and focused on the rockscape before her.

Aisha looked around absently while she kept an eye on Suzie, she knew 
the Human woman was in excellent physical shape, but she had to be 
nearing the end of her oxygen supply. Aisha wasn&#39;t concerned about 
herself, after all, Catarl Catarl were immortal, Suzie wasn&#39;t. That 
weird Taki woman would probably not like it if Suzie died. She wasn&#39;t 
sure if she read things correctly back at the Jade Serpent between 
Suzie and that Taki girl, but it looked like they were mates, or 
something.

Human relationships always confused Aisha, they would say they liked 
someone when their scents clearly said otherwise and acted contrary to 
what they say. She had heard something about same gender relationships 
not being approved of for some reason, but she failed to see why. If 
two people liked each other what was wrong with them getting together? 
Among the Catarl Cartarl, if two wished to become mates, they only had 
to ask the others parents and that was that. Offspring could be worked 
out later through either medical assistance or an intermediary of the 
family if the two could not do so themselves.

Aisha sighed and shook her head, she would never understand Humans. 

------------------------------------------------------------

A large man sat back in a red, velvet chair, his thick hands stroking 
the hair of the scantily clad woman sitting on the floor beside him as 
he watched a monitor showing the surface of his abode. A whimsical 
smile crossed his features as he observed the two suited figures 
stumble around, looking for an entrance.

&quot;Oh, we have guests! How nice.&quot;

&quot;Two humanoids Master,&quot; another woman called from her kneeling 
position by the sensor panel. &quot;A Human and a Catarl Catarl, both 
female&quot; The man perked up at that.

&quot;A Catarl Catarl woman? Oh goodie, I don&#39;t have one of those in my 
collection! Where is the nearest entrance to her?&quot;

&quot;Sector 5 Master.&quot; The woman replied promptly. &quot;Do you wish me to send 
a security force to retrieve her?&quot; The man blinked at the woman 
momentarily, still smiling, before looking back to the screen, a 
malevolent glint in his eyes.

&quot;No, open the rock face; I want to see if she can get here on her own. 
If she does, lead her into the Chamber.&quot;

&quot;Yes Master, what do you want done with the Human female?&quot; The man 
smiled brightly.

&quot;I have enough Human women, kill her.&quot;

&quot;Yes Master.&quot; She nodded and typed at the board before her. The man 
climbed to his feet and, in powerful strides, crossed behind her. The 
woman shuddered slightly as she felt his hand on her shoulder.

&quot;Such a good Muse.&quot; He whispered near her ear. &quot;Come to my rooms in 
five minutes and show me how much you care for me.&quot;

&quot;Yes Master.&quot; She said simply. Somewhere inside her head, the woman 
once known as Inspector Rashel, screamed and pounded at the walls that 
once were her mind. Muse 28 blinked and shook her head before passing 
her station to Muse 15; she needed to please her Master, and being 
late was not the way to do it. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Aisha was starting to get worried; Suzie had stumbled five times in 
the last twenty minutes and was walking unsteadily. The Catarl warrior 
was sure her air had run out but, being the naturally stubborn Human 
that she was, Suzie had not asked for help. Pressing her lips 
together, Aisha strode up behind the dazed assassin and slipped one of 
her arms over her shoulder. The helmeted head turned to her in 
surprise and Aisha narrowed her eyes at the face inside it. Suzie was 
pale and her eyes were dilating, Aisha didn&#39;t even think she could she 
where she was going.

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; She told Suzie, even though she knew the other woman 
wouldn&#39;t hear, &quot;We&#39;re pulling out of here now.&quot; As she reached for the 
beacon clipped to Suzie&#39;s waist, her other hand lifted to point 
unsteadily to the left.

Aisha looked to where Suzie was pointing, her eyes widened at the 
metal airlock set back into a rock face, all but invisible between 
it&#39;s recessed position and the lack of light on it.

&quot;Huh, okay Suzie, you win.&quot; She conceded, nearly dragging her 
companion to the airlock. She blinked at the control panel in 
confusion for a few seconds, wondering what the code could be. An 
increase of weight on her side caused her heart to speed up as she 
turned to Suzie.

&quot;Oh crap!&quot; She swore, Suzie&#39;s face was an unhealthy blue and it did 
not look like she was breathing. &quot;Aggghhh! I don&#39;t have time to find 
any stupid code!&quot; Aisha lifted Suzie up and set her beside the 
airlock. She crouched and pulled her fist back. With a blood curling 
howl, her fist shot forward with enough power to snap this stupid door 
like tinfoil...

...and passed right under the lifting door, causing Aisha to stumble 
in and fall on her face with a startled cry. She pushed herself back 
up with a quick shake of her head.

&quot;Neow?&quot; She looked around, the airlock was empty and no one was on the 
other side so... how&#39;d it open? She decided to worry about that later, 
she turned and pulled Suzie into the airlock, noticing as she did, 
that the assassin&#39;s elbow had been resting on the open button of the 
panel. Aisha looked blankly at the panel then at Suzie for a few 
seconds before screaming:

&quot;THAT WAS ALL THERE WAS TO IT?!?&quot; Grumbling darkly under her breath 
she hit the close-and-cycle button and waited as air filled the room. 
She tossed her helmet to the ground and quickly removed Suzie&#39;s. Aisha 
bit her lip in worried confusion upon seeing Suzie lay there, 
unbreathing still.

&quot;C&#39;mon Suzie, you got air here, why don&#39;t you breathe?&quot; She worried 
her hands on the suit; unmindful that she was ripping it to shreds as 
she tried to think of was to get her friend breathing again.

&quot;Agghh! Damn it! Why didn&#39;t I pay attention to Jim when he was taking 
about first aid?&quot; When the last of her suit fell to the ground, Aisha 
suddenly remembered that one thing Jim told her about, Seapeare or 
something like that. She looked at Suzie&#39;s mouth with a faint blush as 
she lowered her own to her friends. 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Imouto-chan? Can you hear me?&quot;

There was a bright light in her eyes and someone was speaking to her, 
why couldn&#39;t they let her sleep? It was Sunday; she didn&#39;t have any 
training with Okaa-san today.

&quot;Come on Suza-chan. You listen to your sister now; you don&#39;t want me 
to get Okaa-san do you?&quot;

Wait... That voice, she shouldn&#39;t be hearing it should she?

&quot;You should practice your forms little one, you don&#39;t want 
Hitoriga-san to beat you do you?&quot;

A voice, laughing with amusement, one she hadn&#39;t heard in so many 
years...

&quot;Ane-san?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right. Wake up now Suza-chan.&quot;

She opened her eyes, the smiling face and twinkling violet eyes of her 
elder sister, Rei was hovering over hers. Seeing her eyes open, Rei 
smiled wider and sat back.

&quot;About time imouto-chan, I was wondering if you were planning to sleep 
all day.&quot; Suzuka sat up; she recognized the room as her old one she 
used to share with her sister before...

&quot;Ane-san? But, you died...&quot;

Rei smiled softly and smoothed the hair back from her ten-year old 
sister.

&quot;I know Suza-chan, but you avenged me. You avenged us all, but it&#39;s 
over now.&quot;

Suza-chan sighed and looked at her bed mat, a strange feeling filling 
her heart.

&quot;I&#39;m dead, aren&#39;t I?&quot; Rei&#39;s smile faded as she sighed, gathering 
Suza-chan in her arms.

&quot;Dose that bother you?&quot; She asked softly. Suza-chan gazed at her small 
hands, hands that had never taken a life, that wasn&#39;t stained with 
blood. She was innocent again, she should be happy shouldn&#39;t she? So 
what was missing?

*Whoa. That&#39;s a big stick you got there. Wanna see mine? Hahaha...Ow!* 
...Gene.

*Oh, hello Suzuka-san. Your tea is on the table already.* ...Melfina.

*Hey Suzuka. I just need to ask what supplies you want me to get for 
you.* ...Jim.

*Come on Suzie! It&#39;ll be fun!* ...Aisha.

&quot;My friends...&quot; She whispered. Rei chuckled softly.

&quot;Always loyal huh? Just like my little Suza-chan. Nothing has changed 
that, not even what you had to do to find him.&quot;

&quot;Rei-anesan, thank you for understanding and for forgiving me.&quot; A 
bright laugh, one she had so missed, so full of life&#39;s energy filled a 
room suddenly too bright, she couldn&#39;t see. Where..?

&quot;You certainly took your time, huh itooshi?&quot; A forest grove at 
springtime, the flowers were in bloom. Those flowers always were a 
favorite of...

&quot;Maya?&quot; The smirking blonde was sitting on a branch above her. With a 
smile, she dropped in front sixteen-year-old Suzuka and pulled her in 
a hug.

&quot;Who else? Now we can be together forever! Ain&#39;t it so cool?&quot;

&quot;Maya-koi.&quot; Eternity with her first love. Why didn&#39;t it feel...right?

*Suza-chan! Welcome to my new place. I&#39;m going to call it the Jade 
Serpent.* ...Taki.

*Hey Suzie! Let&#39;s go see that ice cream place that just opened!* 
...Aisha?

&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry Maya... I...&quot; A finger placed on her lips cuts her 
off.

&quot;Don&#39;t be my dear one. I will wait for you. And your loved one.&quot; She 
smiled and winked. &quot;In fact, you had better keep me waiting a long 
time, you hear?&quot;

&quot;Maya... ai shiteru.&quot; The blonde smiled and leaned in to kiss Suzuka 
one last time, as she closed her eyes.

&quot;Okay musume-chan, you can look now.&quot; A kind voice, one worn by time 
but still beautiful to hear. Suzuka opened her eyes to see the dojo 
she spent so many years in. There was a mannequin in front of her, a 
white kimono, cut to allow ease of movement was draped over it. She 
recognized it. It had been hanging in the closet of her...

&quot;Okaa-san! I can&#39;t take this from you!&quot;

&quot;Nonsense.&quot; Hitomi told her seventeen-year-old daughter. &quot;I wore it to 
my mastery test and I now want you too. It&#39;s still in good shape, 
it&#39;ll see a good many years before it gives out.&quot; The elderly matron 
smiled at her heir. &quot;Maybe someday you&#39;ll give it to your daughter 
hmm?&quot; Suzuka blushed, how was she to tell her mom...?

&quot;Oh relax little one. I know about Maya, bring her over tomorrow.&quot;

Unconditional love, even knowing what she will be doing. She could 
stay here... right?

*Yo Suzie! You coming?* Aisha...

&quot;Okaa-san...&quot; She smiled at her daughter, and no more words need to be 
said, except...

&quot;I will always be proud of you musume-chan, no matter what.&quot; A swirl 
of wind tore the dojo away, leaving a black plain, a faint glow over 
the far horizon. Her family was waiting for her, but they would wait 
for as long as she needed. Others needed her now. SHE needed her now. 
Suzuka closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Twilight Suzuka opened 
her eyes with a soft smile before she started to run toward the light.

&quot;Hold on Aisha, I&#39;m coming. Don&#39;t start the fun without me.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Aisha wasn&#39;t sure how long she had been breathing for Suzie as well as 
herself when Suzie coughed and began to awaken. She sat back with a 
bright smile and her ears perked up happily while she waited for Suzie 
to get up.

&quot;A... Aisha? Where are we?&quot;

&quot;In that dorks&#39; base. Are you tryin&#39; to kill yourself Suzie? Really, 
letting your oxygen run out without telling me.&quot; The catwoman sat back 
with her arms crossed under her breasts and an indignant expression on 
her face. Suzuka looked at her companion with a slightly bemused look 
and smiled softly. Aisha cut off her scolding when she caught sight of 
the strange look in her friends&#39; eyes.

&quot;Uh... Suzie?&quot; She wasn&#39;t really sure what she was asking but Suzuka&#39;s 
eyes seemed to fill her awareness.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Aisha.&quot; Amazing, Suzuka thought. I never really noticed her 
eyes before...

Aisha tried to keep the blush off her face by clearing her throat and 
standing up, once again hiding behind the mask of the tough girl. 
&quot;Well, just make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again. The others would never 
let me hear the end of it if I let you die. Now then,&quot; Comfortably 
behind her mask again, she turned back to Suzuka with a smirk. &quot;Are we 
gunna get this guy or are we gunna sit here all day?&quot; Suzuka smiled as 
she got up, already shedding the suit to reveal her normal kimono 
beneath.

&quot;I am ready.&quot; She told the warrior. That was stupid Suzuka; she 
thought to herself, you know she&#39;s not going to be interested. All you 
did was make her uncomfortable with you. She quietly sighed as she 
picked her bokken up, glad that, like Gene, Aisha failed to look at it 
too closely before giving it back.

The hall beyond the airlock was plain, double-wide metal and, more 
importantly, deserted. Both women ran silently down the passage, 
keeping an eye out for opposition. 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;They are proceeding down corridor 12, Master.&quot; Another of his Muses 
reported.

The man turned his attention away from Rashel&#39;s brilliant red hair to 
smile lazily at the woman. &quot;&#39;They?&#39; I thought I said to kill the Human 
woman. No matter, send a dozen Angels to take care of it and bring my 
new girl to see the Professor.&quot;

&quot;Yes Master.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Aisha heard the noise first, an almost silent hiss of pneumatics that 
heralded a mechanical construct. &quot;Hold up Suzie,&quot; She said, stopping 
and crouching in her ready stance. &quot;We got the welcome wagon comin&#39; 
our way.&quot;

Suzuka stopped instantly, her bokken snapping before her. &quot;How many?&quot;

Aisha&#39;s ear twitched as she tried to sort the sounds out. &quot;Umm... I&#39;d 
say at least seven, probably more.&quot; Suzuka smiled grimly and nodded.

&quot;No problem.&quot;

They both stood ready, waiting for their new playmates to show up. 
They didn&#39;t have long to wait. A few seconds later, a seven foot 
humanoid robot stepped around the up coming turn with its&#39; 
characteristic steady tread. It turned its bulky body, thick with 
armor and spikes, toward them, the red glow of its eyes focusing on 
the two intruders. With an equally steady tread, more robots stepped 
into view; soon the corridor before them was filled with a dozen 
robots. The two groups stood still, gazing at the other until a silent 
message was passed, and then they charged each other.

------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;&#39;Bawitdaba&#39; Kid Rock&gt;&gt;

Suzuka ran at the lead robot and with a slight gathering of her chi, 
threw a pressure wave at it through the wooden sword. The first robot 
stumbled backward, its front platting shattered and internal workings 
sparking and useless. The robot behind pushed it out of the way and 
continued forward. A roar was her only warning before Aisha shot past 
her, claws tearing the metal plating, hair and tail streaming behind 
her. The felinoid warrior landed in the between three of them and 
disappeared in a whirlwind of claws. The robots jerked about, holes 
appearing in even lines of four all over their frames.

One of the machines raised an arm and a blade, the edges invisible 
behind the ultrasonic field around it, and sliced at Aisha. A shower 
of sparks fell as it met Suzuka. Suzuka smirked at the machine before 
pushing it back and delivering four rapid slices before turning her 
back on the new pile of scrap. A blur passed overhead as a furious 
Catarl Catarl warrior clamped her arms around another&#39;s head and, with 
only the slightest effort, ripped the offending object off. The 
assassin smiled and to herself and, with the path before her cleared, 
spun her blade in a complex series of movements before thrusting 
forward with a defiant cry. From the point of her sword, a ripple 
spread out and down the corridor, buckling metal and throwing shrapnel 
into three of the remaining robots optics and through their bodies.

Almost before the wave faded, Aisha and Suzuka were on the remaining 
three. Aisha punched into the chest of the one closest to her, lifted 
the robot and tossed it at the second as Suzuka jumped and removed the 
final ones head with a lightning fast strike. Both women gave the 
other a self satisfied smirk as the last of the robots fell with a 
hollow &#39;clang.&#39; 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Amazing! Truly a force of nature! I must have her!&quot; The man was 
almost beside himself in eagerness.

&quot;Easy Gabriel, we must move with caution, yes, yes caution, that&#39;s 
it.&quot;

Gabriel, the self-styled Vengeance of Heaven, turned to the skinny 
human man behind him with a growl.

&quot;I must have her Professor; I don&#39;t care what you must do to make it 
happen. You know our deal just as well as I&quot;

The Professor nodded and pushed his glasses back in place and turned, 
leaving the control room. 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Say Suzie,&quot;

&quot;How many times must I tell you to not call me that infantile 
nickname?&quot;

&quot;Whatever Suzie! Anyways, where&#39;d you learn that last attack you did? 
The one that ripped up the corridor.&quot; Suzuka sighed and glanced at the 
shorter woman beside her. Having passed the dozen security robots, the 
pair had looked about. Most of the rooms were only storage spaces for 
various supplies, enough to keep the station self-sufficient for a 
couple of years depending on how many people were aboard. They finally 
found an elevator down and were waiting for it to stop when Aisha 
asked.

&quot;If you must know, it&#39;s a move my mother taught me when I was younger. 
I don&#39;t use it too much because it only really works in close 
quarters.&quot;

&quot;But we&#39;ve been in plenty of close combat before.&quot; Aisha pried.

&quot;Yes, and usually close to the skin of a ship or station. If the 
passage broke, we would have lost atmosphere.&quot; Suzuka bluntly replied, 
wishing she would drop it.

&quot;Oh...&quot; Aisha nodded and remained silent just long enough for Suzuka 
to think she was done. &quot;You&#39;ve never said anything about your mom 
before. What was she like?&quot;

Suzuka&#39;s knuckles tightened on her sword as she tried to form a reply. 
She was saved from an answer by the arrival of the lift however, and 
she gratefully grasped the opportunity.

&quot;Come on, we don&#39;t have time for useless chatter.&quot; Aisha pouted for a 
second before entering behind Suzuka.

The lift deposited the two women at the end of a short hallway, two 
sets of doors on either side and a set of double doors at the end of 
the hall lead to other rooms. Unlike the halls above, this one had 
deep red carpeting, wooden panels and soft lighting giving it a much 
homier feel. Aisha raised a brow.

&quot;Nice. Someone likes his creature comforts.&quot; Suzuka nodded and stepped 
out, bokken at the ready.

As they moved slowly down the hall, the doors to their right opened. 
Suzuka sliced at it as she swung about to face the doorway, Aisha 
already waiting for something to come out. When nothing emerged, the 
two cautiously approached the arch. Pressing themselves flat against 
the wall, they made eye contact with the other and, with a sharp nod, 
dashed into the room and away from the door.

Suzuka stood and moved her gaze over the various shelves and tables, 
trying to pierce the gloom in the back of the room. Aisha had barely 
made it in before she had a hand over her nose.

&quot;Ewww... This place smells terrible!&quot; Suzuka blinked at her friend and 
sniffed.

&quot;Laboratory disinfectant. Unpleasant, but hardly to the degree you&#39;re 
making it out to.&quot;

&quot;Quiet Suzie! You don&#39;t have my sense of smell.&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes, quite right. The Human sense of smell dose not equal that 
of a Catarl Catarl. No, no it does not.&quot;

Both women looked at the source of the voice as he emerged from the 
shadows in the back of the room. Suzuka&#39;s eyes widened at the figure, 
taking in his dark skin, white hair and wide eyes.

&quot;Professor Khan?!?&quot;
