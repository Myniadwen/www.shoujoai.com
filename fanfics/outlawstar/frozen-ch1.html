<h1>Frozen Fire</h1>

<pre>A figure rose at the far end of the bar, placing a tip on the counter 
then turning to leave, hand moving to grip the hilt of a long, slender 
bokken as a threat to those who dare deck her stride. As I watched 
this figure sway to the soft sounds of the jukebox as she departed, I 
grinned to myself as I devoured her backside. Her seemingly thick 
thighs to those curved hips along with that firm ass and up the small 
of her back to the creamy skin on her neck. Black hair piled high in a 
plait fashion that cascaded down her back.

As she pushed her way through the doors, our eyes met for a brief 
second. Humph, I say quietly to myself, returning to my drink, gulping 
it down and placing the shot-glass down onto the counter. As I 
dismount my stool, back towards it, I glance over to the right at the 
spot where the pale woman with the raven tresses and lean fundamental 
nature sat. I smirked, looking over my shoulder to the mirror behind 
the bar counter. I saw a face staring back at me through the beer 
bottles that were placed upon the shelves in front of the mirror. 

A face well shrouded in the dimness of the bar. My face; promising as 
I turn around to view this despicable excuse for a concealing outfit. 
My eyes; hidden as I come across the shades covering them. I run my 
fingers over the dark shades, contemplating my life as far as my mind 
can reach. My hair; blonde and wavy yet curly in some places. I hated 
this get up, but I had no choice nor the time to protest. In a sudden 
flash, I caught myself staring into the face behind the beer bottles. 
&lt;I&#146;ve seen that woman.... somewhere...&gt; 
	
I turn the seat she was seated in around on the stool, hoping to grab 
any loose thoughts that shouted out to me about that woman. Turning it 
some more, I sigh in dismay as I turn to leave. &lt;There is nothing 
about that woman I know about.&gt; I stop dead in my tracks in the middle 
of the bar, turning to look at her seat again. &lt;Or is there...?&gt; I 
shake the eerie idea from my shoulders and continue to leave. As I&#146;m 
about to depart, the bartender called me back.

&#147;&#146;Scuse me.. Woman in that seat you were lookin&#146; at left this for ya.&#148;

I turn to one side, staring at the note in his hands. I skimmed over 
the piece of paper carefully before considering to take it. Taking 
slow steps up to the bartender, I close my eyes a minute to push out 
the peculiar feeling before my thoughts were yet again interrupted.

&#147;Ya gonna take or ain&#146;t ya?&#148;

I growl irritably and snatch the note from his shaking hands, causing 
him to tremble, stumbling slightly backwards. I shove the note into my 
pocket, then turned to glare at everyone in the bar, removing the 
shades from my eyes, giving them the Mind-Your-Own-God-Damn-Business 
glare. They all turned their eyes back to what they were doing as I 
continued to leave. I shoved the bar doors open, walking down the 
lonely streets, pushing my way around people.

I moved through crowds of drunks and bums along with prostitutes 
hailing various cars up and down the street, flashing their appealing 
body&#145;s to men in hopes of making a good lay. Possibly with enough 
financial support in the end without getting raped or killed. It&#146;s a 
pity to see such beautiful women bear down to such distasteful acts 
such as prostitution. 

I walk further down this Entry to Hell as I call it, seeing no one 
ever left this down quiet from about midnight to maybe around four AM 
or so I&#145;ve heard. There would always be something to cause a 
disturbance about down here on the Dark Side of Hayfong, some place I 
came across while racing to lose a trail of Pirates who know some very 
powerful Tao Magic. 

Anyway, I&#146;m going back to a place I came across since I might as well 
stick around an wait until all hell brakes loose, since I&#145;ve got 
something those Tao Freaks want. A suitcase that I snatched right 
before the Tao&#146;s could reach it. Pissed those freaks off enough to 
follow me all through space. Anyhow, I&#146;m incognito, well, I&#146;m trying 
to be at least. Unless you can picture me a blonde with a pair of 
sunglasses, tacky red and white outfit, work boots and a blue jacket 
with a name like Rachel Sweet... then... there you go.

Opening the doors of the raggedy apartment building I was staying in 
for the time, the smells of sex, beer and dampness overwhelmed my 
senses. Shaking my head from vertigo, I slowly ascended the steps in 
the ostensibly low income high-rise of this retched town. I caught 
sight of this slut giving this guy head at the end of the hallway. The 
guy looked up and winked. I flicked him off, continuing down the hall 
and up another flight of stairs. 

I stopped at the top of the steps, looking down, growling in 
annoyance. Stepping over a couple in 69 position, shaking my head in 
revulsion, I trudged onward. Finally reaching my destination, I 
fumbled with my keys. It was too damn dark even without my shades to 
see an inch in front of my face. I dropped my keys and gave a yell in 
frustration. I decided to open my door the old fashioned way. 

*WHAM*

I nearly kicked the door off it&#146;s hinges in anger, turning to find the 
couple in 69, jump, gather their clothes and leave abruptly. &lt;I still 
got it... even in this get-up...&gt; I grin, moving over to pick up the 
door and replacing it on it&#146;s frame. I sighed, turning around. The 
first thing I saw was that suitcase. Walking up to it, I ran my hand 
along the cool exterior of the piece of luggage. I thought of how 
pissed those Tao Freaks were. I was determined to make my efforts 
worthwhile, I&#146;d open it so I wouldn&#146;t have to lug around this metal 
contraption. 

Typing in the code, it opened, making a loud hissing noise as smoke 
started to seep through the openings. I sat back and watched the 
suitcase go through a series of safety checks and inspections of it&#146;s 
surroundings. That&#39;s when I saw her. Melfina. She was in the suitcase, 
curled up, holding her knees, lifeless at the moment. She wouldn&#39;t be 
lifless for long though. Tired of waiting, I decided to take a hot 
shower and get rid of this phony disguise until tomorrow when I&#146;d 
ditch this planet with my prize. 

The bathroom wasn&#146;t any better than the rest of this shit hole. I just 
pardoned the matter as I began to strip off my clothing. As I turned 
on the water, tuning it to hot, it felt nice against my skin with both 
my hands on the wall, feet spread as if I were being searched by the 
police, letting my head hang under the pressure. The hot water would 
flow, surging down my back, ass, and thighs, down to my calves and 
then my feet.  

Lifting my head slowly, I ran my fingers through my hair, removing the 
excess water from of my short mane. I grabbed a sponge, covering it 
with soap, running it over my nicely proportioned body. I began 
lathering my more sensitive areas, then rinsing off completely. I 
grabbed the shampoo, washing my dark hair. As I turned the water off, 
I began groping for a near by towel. 

Wiping off my face, I looked in the mirror after erasing the fog, 
staring at the likeness in the pane of reflective glass. Not some 
replica but the face I was given. The patch over my right eye, 
limiting my vision to nearly half of what it used to be. I wouldn&#146;t 
call myself visually impaired. The patch makes me seem more 
intimidating towards those who feel they can match me. I grin at the 
mirror image, shaking my head in amusement. Wrapping the towel around 
myself, I left the steamy bathroom.

The chill I received when I entered the next room made my hairs stand 
on end, shuddering slightly. I gazed up to find Melfina standing stark 
naked in the middle of my living room. I noticed her eyes were closed 
and that she was standing very still. I decided to wake her up and get 
her some clothes.

&#147;Melfina, wake up.&#148;

Her body seemed to quiver as her eyes snapped open, looking at me. Her 
soft hazel eyes began to dart about the room as if questioning her 
being here. I could see tears beginning to form in her lenient eyes. I 
sighed and walked up to her, pulling her small form against mine. I 
heard her sniffling and choking up. Her harms were over her chest in 
an X like position as I embraced her tiny body against my mature 
stature. I held her for a few minutes longer until I felt she really 
needed clothes.

&#147;I need to get you dressed. We leave tomorrow.&#148;

I then released my grip and for once, gazed, long and hard into her 
distant hazel eyes. She sniffled and lifted her hand to my patch. She 
proceeded by running her slender finger tips over it. And through the 
loud ringing in my ears, I could hear her soft voice speaking to me, 
hushed as if worried someone would find her out and harm her.

&#147;What happened...&#148;

I jerk my head away from her grip. She looked wounded from my callous 
actions. Replacing her hand back to her side, I turn around, walking 
towards my bedroom. Stopping, I answered her in that cold, aloof way 
I&#39;m so used to.

&#147;It&#39;s a long, degrading story with inconsiderate mistakes I made 
simply without knowing any better. Come on now, Melfina. We need to 
get you dressed.&#148;

I didn&#145;t hear a response and guessed she was pleased with my answer or 
distraught by my sudden act of impulse. Entering my bedroom, I 
gestured towards the bed as she sat down. I looked at her through the 
corner of my eye as I searched the drawers. She seemed to be the quiet 
keen and brisk type, but with a disturbing history that cascaded over 
her, invading her thoughts every so often. I shook off the same 
feeling I felt at the bar. Tossing her a shirt with a pair of shorts, 
I left to put on my own clothing.

I emerged wearing a black sports bra with matching shorts. Melfina was 
sitting in the middle of the bed with a smile on her face. I stared at 
her a moment and her smile faded to that solemn look she&#146;d emit. I 
moved to the bed, hoisting my legs onto the divan, lying back with my 
hands behind my head, sighing. I could feel something against me. 
Looking down, Melfina had latched onto me, her tiny arms around my 
mid-section and her head on my shoulder. I moved my arm to gather up 
the blanket, tossing some over us, moving back to hold her.

I pondered various things as I lay with Melfina, who cuddled close, 
eyes closed, mind dreaming, scheming possibly. My thoughts began to 
drift to that woman I saw at the bar and how she somehow ties in with 
me. I doubt she has anything to do with my life. I look over in the 
darkness to the small package holding onto me as if afraid I&#146;d leave 
her during the night. I leaned close and pressed a soft kiss to her 
forehead. She mewled, tightening her grip on me. 

I smiled for the first time out of absolute contentment. But that 
smile didn&#146;t last very long as I began to think about the Tao Freaks. 
And how they&#146;d take Melfina away from me if I failed to protect her. I 
shifted to my side, wrapping my other arm around her, holding her to 
me. My eyes narrowed as I gritted my teeth, clinging to Melfina 
protectively with one thought in my mind. Those Tao Bastards would 
have to get through _me_ if they plan on taking Melfina. And _that_ 
was my new objective...
