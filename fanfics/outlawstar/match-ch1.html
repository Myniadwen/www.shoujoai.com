------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Melfina sat in the galley of the Outlaw Star, thinking about some of 
the latest developments in her life. While she was built to mimic 
human females perfectly and was programmed with a complete library on 
the reproductive systems of various humanoid species, and, if called 
upon to do so, could even perform the act of sex, one thing that 
puzzled her was the emotion called love. While she didn&#39;t fully 
understand it, she most certainly felt it when it came to a certain 
member of the Outlaw Star&#39;s crew. 

Some would say it was Gene or maybe even Jim that Melfina was in love 
with, but they would be sadly mistaken. While the possibility of her 
loving Suzuka was there, it would still be incorrect. No, the one that 
the beautiful android loved was none other than Aisha Clanclan of the 
Ctarlctarl Empire. But Melfina wasn&#39;t sure about how to tell Aisha 
about her feelings. Or if she should attempt to do so, for that 
matter. 

&quot;If I told her, how would she react? The odds of her returning my love 
are astronomical.&quot; she thought. Then she remembered something she saw 
in a romance movie a few weeks earlier. &quot;Maybe if I wrote Aisha a 
letter saying that I wanted to meet her somewhere without actually 
telling her who I am, then I might have the opportunity.&quot; With this, 
Melfina sat down at Jim&#39;s desk and began to write her letter, being 
careful to disguise her handwriting. It was two-thirty P.M. 

Three Hours Later.... 

Aisha Clanclan staggered into the galley, hoping that Mel had fixed 
something earlier. Her boss had been running her ragged at the diner 
and she was almost dead on her feet. After coming up with a rather 
large fish sandwich and a bottle of sake, she decided to relax with 
some television until the others arrived. The first thing she saw when 
she reached for the remote was a small, white envelope. 

There was no address, no return address and no stamp. It simply said 
&quot;Aisha&quot; in a style that she did not recognize as belonging to any 
other member of the Outlaw Star&#39;s crew. Curiousity getting the better 
of her, she opened the envelope. The letter read: 

Dear, Aisha. For some time now, I have been admiring your beauty, 
grace and obvious talents. I wanted to come forward and tell you in 
person, but I did not have the courage and I could not keep my 
feelings bottled up any longer. I love you, Aisha Clanclan, and wish 
to meet you and the Full Moon Hotel tonight at eight P.M. I beg you, 
come alone. If anyone were to know about this before I can find a way 
to soften the blow, it could be disasterous for both of us. When you 
arrive at the hotel, just tell the clerk that you wish to see the 
person in room two thirty-eight. He&#39;ll give you a key. I paid him well 
enough that he won&#39;t ask you anything, so don&#39;t worry about that 
aspect. If you do not wish to come, I will find out soon enough and, 
although I will be hurt, I will understand. I mean, with men like Gene 
Starwind around, why would someone like you even bother with a nobody 
like me? Again, I ask you to come alone and do not judge me before I 
have a chance to tell you the depth of my feelings. Love, Your Secret 
Admirer 

Aisha looked at the letter with a stunned look on her face. &quot;I&#39;ve 
never had anyone who felt like this about me before.&quot; she said. &quot;Well, 
apparently this person has good taste. I mean, he did choose me as the 
love of his life.&quot; She checked her watch. Six-thirty P.M. She had an 
hour and a half to get a dress and apply just the right beauty 
treatment to her already-gorgeous features. Thirty minutes and nine 
blocks later found Aisha in a women&#39;s clothing store looking at 
several fine pieces of cloth. She had totally bypassed the 
undergarments. Not only did she hear that they were terribly 
uncomfortable, but they were banned by her people, as well. 

After selecting a red silk dress that had only a thin strap and a 
clasp at the neck to hold it up and a hemline that came halfway down 
her slim thighs, she then completed her outfit with a pair of matching 
heels and an earring-and-tiara set, both made of the gem known as a 
ruby. Aisha had almost blown her paycheck for that week on the 
ensemble, but she figured it would be worth it. Now it was time to hit 
the makeup rack. A thorough search of the various types of cosmetics 
turned up a compact with a pink powder that perfectly highlighted her 
cheeks and lipstick the same color as her tiara. The final touch was 
the last-minute addition of nail polish, again the color of her head 
jewel. It was now seven forty-five P.M. Aisha was rushing to the 
counter to pay for her items and get ready for her date. 

Ten Minutes Later... 

Aisha looked at herself in the full-length mirror the store&#39;s dressing 
room provided and smiled. The heels, while not as high as was 
fashionable, were elevated just enough to give her a seductive, 
come-and-get-me walk. The dress was almost skin-tight and it showed 
off her hips, trim buttocks and full, well-developed breasts in just 
the way she liked. The powder made her cheeks a rosy pink and gave her 
nose that rabbit-like, cute-as-a-button look. It also accented her 
whiskers and gave them a sparkle which could not be rivaled by even 
the prettiest gemstone. The earrings were perfect teardrops with small 
diamonds in the center and the tiara was almost identical to them with 
a larger diamond imbedded in it. The nail polish brought out the 
beauty of her light, delicate fingers and her soft, kissable lips were 
made even more attractive by a light touch of the lipstick. After 
leaving the store, she proceeded to walk the three blocks to the 
hotel. 

Checking her watch again, Aisha saw that she would be a mere five 
minutes late at the most. &quot;Well, if the guy loves me as much as he 
says he does, he won&#39;t mind waiting a few extra minutes to see me in 
all my glory.&quot; At approximately eight-oh-three P.M., Aisha found 
herself at the front desk of the Full Moon Hotel and asking for the 
key to the room where she was to meet the person who&#39;s heart she had 
captured. She stepped in the elevator, pressed the button for the 
second floor and started to sweat a little as the doors closed in 
front of her. Less than a minute later, she was walking down the hall 
looking for the thirty-eighth room. When she found it, she knocked on 
the door. Without recieving an answer, she tried the doorknob. 

It was unlocked. The cat-girl opened the door and saw that the room 
was totally dark, save for a small light beside the king-size bed. 
Stepping inside, Aisha shut the door and started looking for a 
lightswitch. After a few seconds of sliding along the wall to her 
right, her fingers came into contact with something. But it wasn&#39;t the 
switch. 

It was another hand. 

Letting out a small &#39;Eep!&#39;, Aisha drew her hand back, only to feel it 
lightly clasped by two others. &quot;Do not be afraid. We are together now, 
my love.&quot; 

&quot;Th-that voice... You can&#39;t be.....&quot; Then the lights came on. 
&quot;MELFINA?!&quot; Aisha screamed, again pulling her hand away. Mel was 
wearing the cloak that she usually did, but something was strange. She 
had it closed around her, her legs were bare and her hair was straight 
down, not looking like she had just stuck her finger into an 
electricity outlet. Also, there was a look in her eyes that Aisha had 
never seen before. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad you made it, Aisha. I was beginning to worry that you 
wouldn&#39;t show up.&quot; the android said in a soft voice. 

&quot;Okay, Gene, you&#39;ve had your fun. Now get out here so I can pound ya!&quot; 
Aisha shouted angrily. 

&quot;This is no joke. Gene had nothing to do with this. I alone called you 
here.&quot; The Ctarlctarl&#39;s jaw dropped. Then, with a nervous tone, 
Melfina said, &quot;I love you.&quot; Aisha looked stunned, but soon regained 
her composure. 

&quot;Well, this is unexpected.&quot; she said, sitting down on the bed. &quot;I&#39;m 
not really sure what to say. It&#39;s not that you aren&#39;t attractive. 
Quite the opposite, actually. It&#39;s just that, well, I&#39;ve never had a 
lot of experience in this field. I&#39;m not a virgin, mind you, but I&#39;ve 
never slept with another woman. Besides, I&#39;m not even sure how I feel 
about you.&quot; 

&quot;Take your time to sort everything out. Even if you aren&#39;t in love 
with me, know that I will always be here for you.&quot; She sat on the bed 
next to Aisha and let the cloak open a little, showing off her 
cleavage. Aisha&#39;s eyes widened in admiration as she, for the first 
time, started to realize just what Melfina was feeling. The android 
had a beauty that would make even the most attractive women in the 
galaxy extremely jealous. She had a charming personality that Aisha, 
much to her surprise, found to be a turn-on. While her feelings for 
Melfina were there right from the moment Aisha had seen her for the 
first time, the depth of those feelings was uncertain. Was it merely a 
physical attraction, or was there something more? Aisha had been 
attracted to other females in the past, but they had all been other 
Ctarlctarl and that sort of thing, while not totally banned, was not 
accepted by most members of the Imperial Government. 

Melfina looked into Aisha&#39;s eyes and saw what appeared to be the first 
signs of tears. Indeed, the cat-girl was moved by all this. But the 
thing Mel was debating was whether or not this was a waste of time. 
Also, a new fear crept into her mind: What if Aisha didn&#39;t return her 
feelings and then told Gene about this? She would never hear the end 
of it. Jim would probably die laughing and Gilliam, even though he was 
a machine, wasn&#39;t past a little teasing every now and then. It was as 
if Aisha&#39;s mind was trying to tell her something. She remembered the 
first time she had seen Melfina. Yes, there definately was a physical 
attraction. Then, through all their time on the Outlaw Star, she 
started to get to know Melfina and grew to see the android as a friend 
and someone who she knew would keep her darkest secrets. A sense of 
respect was there along with gratitude for not telling anyone of their 
conversations, but was love present? Aisha could not determine that at 
the time. As she tried to ease her mind away from the subject, her 
subconcious took control of her for a brief moment and she did 
something totally unexpected. 

She kissed Melfina. 

While it shocked them both, niether made any move to break it. The 
android, taking the initiative, wrapped her arms around Aisha&#39;s waist 
and slowly placed her toungue in the cat-girl&#39;s mouth. Aisha, still a 
bit stunned, found herself reciprocating Mel&#39;s actions. And enjoying 
the experience. She reluctantly broke the kiss, slid off her shoes and 
tiara and put her earrings on the table beside the bed. She pointed 
toward Melfina&#39;s cloak and the other girl let it fall from around her 
shoulders, revealing what she was wearing beaneath it. 

Absolutely nothing. Aisha marvelled at the well-developed breasts and 
her syes slowly made their way down to Mel&#39;s crotch. The short, 
finely-trimmed black hairs were already glistening with juices, 
indicating that the girl was aroused by this experience. A sly grin 
spread across Aisha&#39;s face and she slowly undid the clasp holding her 
dress up. Standing, she let it fall, exposing her beautiful body to 
the android&#39;s eyes. Her full, rounded breasts were larger than Melfina 
originally thought and, gazing down at her groin, determined that her 
hair color was natural. They laid down on the bed and moved back into 
their embrace, rubbing their breasts together while they kissed. 

Aisha used her tail to reach around and slowy rub Mel&#39;s back, 
eliciting a moan from the other girl. Melfina wasn&#39;t sure that they 
should go this far just yet. Pulling her lips away from the other 
girl&#39;s, she asked &quot;Are you sure this is all right, Aisha? I mean, we 
shouldn&#39;t just jump into this.&quot; Aisha placed her finger on Mel&#39;s lips. 

&quot;Isn&#39;t this what you&#39;ve wanted from the first time you saw me? 
Besides, it may be the only way either one of us can be sure if we 
want to go through with this whole thing or not.&quot; Then she resumed the 
kiss. This went on for a couple of minutes and then, as if their 
thoughts were one, they simultaneously grabbed their partner&#39;s rear 
and slowly guided their crotches together, then turned so that Aisha 
was on top. She started to move her cunt along Melfina&#39;s, cusing them 
both to moan into each other&#39;s mouths. 

This was a completely new experience for Melfina. After she had been 
built, the scientists had wanted to &#39;test&#39; their new creation and she 
had been opened up to the joys of sex. She had enjoyed every minute of 
it. They were gentle, kind men who had originally built this secondary 
function into her so that she could blend in perfectly no matter where 
she went. Emotions, like love, were programmed into her to make this 
camoflage complete. However, there had been one drawback. Melfina did 
not rely on circuits or gears; she was completely biological. This 
meant that, if the circumstances were right, she could bear a child. 
While this had not happened yet, she wished that, someday, it would. 

Aisha was really getting into this. After both females had an orgasm, 
the cat-girl decided to try something different. Getting off Melfina 
and again breaking their kiss, she started sucking on Mel&#39;s left 
breast, running her tongue over the bright pink nipple. The other girl 
started moaning louder and Aisha took the pleasure up a notch by 
inserting all five fingers of her right hand into Melfina&#39;s pussy. 
Within a minute, Melfina had another orgasm and had to stop and catch 
her breath. After she had recovered, she began giving Aisha the same 
treatment she had just recieved. The Ctarlctarl started crying to the 
heavens in pleasure as her second orgasm approached. When it hit about 
a minute later, she couldn&#39;t feel anything but the pleasure for an 
eternal twenty seconds. When it died down, she, too, had to catch her 
breath, all the while trembling as her orgasm faded. 

Getting a new idea, Melfina lay on top of Aisha, turned around so that 
they were breast-to-belly and started licking at her partner&#39;s most 
sensitive area. Aisha, gripping Mel&#39;s smooth buttocks, returned the 
favor. After several minutes of licking and playful teasing, Melfina 
took her right index finger and began probing Aisha&#39;s cunt while 
licking the clit. Again, the Ctarlctarl was more than happy to give 
her lover the same treatment that she was getting, plus an added 
surprise. Before Mel had relized what had happened, Aisha had taken 
her left finger and pushed it into Melfina&#39;s rear entrance. This was 
an entirely new sensation and the android didn&#39;t want to be only a 
reciever, so she stuck her free finger into Aisha&#39;s ass. Wrapping 
their legs around each other&#39;s heads, they licked, sucked and probed 
each other into another world. When their orgasms hit, the pleasure 
was so intense that they almost passed out. 

Melfina rolled off her lover and, after a few seconds of recovery, 
went to the other side of the room, picked up a small black bag and 
went to stand next to the bed. &quot;Feel like another round?&quot; she asked 
playfully. 

&quot;What&#39;s in the bag?&quot; 

&quot;This.&quot; Mel reached into the bag and produced the first double-headed 
dildo Aisha had ever seen. Inserting one end into herself, the android 
crawled back onto the bed and pointed the other end of the dick, which 
was made of an incredibly realistic synthetic flesh, at Aisha&#39;s 
entrance. Moving slowly, she began to slide in, causing her lover to 
moan softly. When their groins were almost connected again, Mel 
reached down to the underside of the dildo and pressed a small, almost 
invisible button, which caused it to start vibrating. Aisha motioned 
for her to continue. Melfina started to pull out, then moved back in, 
increasing her pace with every thrust. Soon, she was pushing in and 
out at an incredible rate and the cat-girl was beginning to hump back. 

After what seemed like an eternity to them both, Mel pulled out, then 
pushed in one final time and the two young lovers had their most 
powerful orgasms ever. Pulling out of the Ctarlctarl and switching off 
the dildo, Mel placed it back in the bag and lay down beside Aisha, 
who rolled onto her side so that they were face-to-face. Melfina ran 
her hands through Aisha&#39;s soft, cream-colored hair that was soaked 
with sweat after thier encounter. &quot;That.... was...... the best... 
ever.&quot; Aisha said, still trying to catch her breath. 

&quot;Yes... it was.&quot; replied her lover. &quot;Have you... decided... about... 
your feelings... yet?&quot; 

&quot;I.. have.&quot; After a short pause, &quot;I love you... Melfina. I think.... I 
have... for a long time.&quot; With this said, the two women kissed once 
more, pulled the blankets around them and fell asleep basking in the 
after glow of their lovemaking. 

The Next Day..... 

Melfina and Aisha awoke with the sun the next morning. Dressing 
quickly, they grabbed Mel&#39;s bag, took the elevator down to the lobby 
and then ran out the door, trying to get back to the Outlaw Star 
before Jim, Suzuka and Gene arrived there. They managed to make it 
mere minutes before the trio walked in. 

After searching the cabinets with no luck, Jim asked &quot;Gene, where&#39;s 
Melfina? I&#39;m starving! Chasing after the hundred or so chickens you 
let loose while we were fixing that tractor was exhausting.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Jim. She was supposed to pick up a month&#39;s worth of 
groceries last night, but I haven&#39;t seen her since yesterday. I had a 
fish sandwich we could have split, but it&#39;s gone.&quot; Just then, Suzuka 
entered the room. 

&quot;I called the diner, Gene. The manager said that Aisha didn&#39;t show up 
this morning and she didn&#39;t call in sick, either.&quot; 

&quot;I wonder where those two could be....&quot; Gene said. Then, after a 
sudden inspiration, &quot;Gilliam, do you have any video records of the 
ship&#39;s activities yesterday in your memory banks?&quot; he asked to one of 
the small heads that happned to be travelling by at that time. 

Gilliam was silent for a moment and then said, &quot;Not for the entire 
day. I was offline from the hours of twelve P.M. yesterday until five 
P.M.&quot; 

&quot;Can you show us what you did record?&quot; asked the frustrated pilot. 

&quot;Affirmative. One moment, please.&quot; After a second, a holo-image of the 
galley appeared and Aisha walked in a few minutes later. Gene uttered 
a low growl when he saw the Ctarlctarl devouring his prized sandwich. 
The camera shifted and they saw her walk in, read the letter, say 
something about a dress, and then leave. 

&quot;Gilliam,&quot; Gene said, &quot;back up to frame Beta Three Twenty-Seven and 
freeze.&quot; The image rewound to where Aisha held the letter directly 
below the camera. &quot;Zoom in. One hundred times maginification.&quot; In a 
few seconds, the other three were able to read the message. When they 
were done, Gene sat down in a chair and told Gilliam to shut off the 
replay. 

&quot;So that&#39;s what happened.&quot; Suzuka said. &quot;Aisha&#39;s found herself a 
boyfriend.&quot; 

Jim shook his head and chuckled. &quot;I should have figured that kitten 
would get herself a man sooner or later.&quot; 

&quot;A kitten with the strength and temper of a tiger, you mean,&quot; Gene 
replied. &quot;I think it&#39;s safe to assume where she is now, but where the 
hell is Melfina?&quot; 

&quot;Both of them are in Aisha&#39;s quarters.&quot; Gilliam said. 

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you say so before?&quot; Jim asked. 

&quot;You never gave that command.&quot; replied the computer. &quot;And besides 
that, I still haven&#39;t forgiven you for painting that one service drone 
pink.&quot; Jim face-vaulted and Gene started laughing like a maniac. When 
the captain had regained control of himself and Jim picked himself up 
off the floor, the trio made their way to Aisha&#39;s bedroom. 

When they got there, they discovered that the door was open a crack 
and the lights were off. Gene pushed the door the rest of the way open 
and switched the light on. Melfina and Aisha were on the bed, stark 
naked, kissing passionately and groping each other. 

Mel looked over at the others, who&#39;s lower jaws had descended to the 
floor and said, &quot;Um, oops.&quot; A large sweatdrop appeared on Jim&#39;s 
forehead, Suzuka looked like she had known about it the entire time 
and Gene&#39;s eyes rolled upward as he fell backwards onto the floor.
