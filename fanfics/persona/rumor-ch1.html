<h1>Ulala's Rumor</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../persona/index.html">Persona</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/takemenew.html">La Parka Girl/Take Me New</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&#147;If we live in a world where rumors can come true...maybe we also live 
in one where dreams are a possibility.&#148;

It was this thought that had run through Ulala&#146;s mind for nearly three 
weeks. Over and over again the thought spun in her mind, a source of 
obsession since she learned of the mysterious power of rumors in the 
world in which she lived. She had never thought it possible that such 
a thing could really exist, but when she saw the man come to her and 
sell guns in the bar, she had become a believer. Rumors were real. 
From the second they were started they became as true as any fact, and 
the world seemed to bend around the wishes and desires of whatever the 
rumor may be. At first it was a little frightening, which is why Ulala 
had taken so long to do what she did. In the beginning she was afraid 
of what the rumor spreading would do, but as she saw the others spread 
rumor after rumor seemingly without a care, she grew to trust and even 
have faith within the system. It wasn&#146;t long before she decided to 
undertake a rumor of her own, one that she had hoped and dreamed for 
for some time.

Ulala was seated upon a large couch in a local hotel, her right hand 
perched around the stem of a tall glass of wine. The wine was rich and 
red, though its color was difficult to make out inside the darkness. 
In the hotel room in which she sat, all the lights had been turned 
off, and only a few candles gave illumination in the dark, black 
night. There was a candle by the entrance door and a candle in the 
bathroom, and finally there were two in the extra room where the bed 
laid, one on each side. Ulala smiled to herself, and from her seat on 
the couch she regarded the second door which led to the bedroom. It 
was a good bit more expensive to rent the larger hotel room for the 
night, but when push came to shove she was happy she had spent the 
money. The hotel room looked more open in the current setup, and for 
that particular night she wanted nothing to be cramped.

Without a sound Ulala sipped a little at the wine she held in her 
hand. Hotel wine, not very good, but it made up for it by being twice 
as expensive as a normal wine. The bottle she had opened had been set 
at the edge of the coffee table, where it laid alongside another glass 
like hers, although empty. At first Ulala struggled to not open the 
bottle until the time had come, but the nerves that shot through her 
body forced a quick reprieve of the self-imposed doctrine. Her current 
goal was to only have one glass before the time came, and so far it 
seemed attainable. In ten minutes time she had only emptied half a 
glass, and it was soon the time she had waited for. Seemingly without 
a care she glanced at her watch, and smiled.

Four minutes. Knowing the way the rumors worked, it would happen just 
as she instructed it, precisely on the dot and without any wavering 
from what she set up. A momentary pang of guilt was sent through her, 
but she tried hard to shake it off with another long sip from her 
wine.

&#147;It&#146;s all right.&#148; Her mind told itself, and she closed her eyes as she 
thought. &#147;Nothing wrong with what you&#146;ve done. You deserve this.&#148;

She took another drink of wine, to help her swallow her thoughts. She 
had spread the rumor just that very afternoon, at only a quarter until 
five. It was now two in the morning, and the rumor certainly must have 
flowed through the city by now. It was a simple rumor, but still Ulala 
wondered if it would actually work. She had only seem the rumors take 
effect on a larger scale, and the notion of causing rumors about 
someone&#146;s romantic entanglements was a trade entirely unknown to her. 
A lot could go wrong, if it even worked at all. The fat man at the 
detective agency had told her that repeatedly, but despite his 
warnings she wanted nothing more than to continue. Now her mind was 
beginning to worry, and she could only drink to ease the pressure.

Another long sip on her wine, and she noticed her glass had finally 
become empty. Another glance of her watch revealed a time of two 
minutes and counting to her, so she decided she could tough the rest 
of the time out without the aide of more booze. She wanted to be alert 
when and if it happened, and she was afraid anything more than one 
drink might come to effect her judgment. She set the glass down 
alongside the other empty one, and waited.

Her hands folded down into her lap, and she sighed a bit, wondering if 
what she had chosen to wear was appropriate. Her outfit was casual but 
not so slacked as it usually was, for she went out of her way to 
choose clothes that both showed off her body and kept a touch of 
class. The result was a thick white sweater that clung tightly to her 
form, and a pair of equally tight jeans that clung snugly to her legs. 
She questioned again in regard to her outfit, and wondered if it was 
nearly as good as she first thought. Anyone could tell she was trying 
to dress as someone she&#146;s not, but these were odd circumstances. Blue 
jeans and a sweater were hardly on the list of Ulala&#146;s favorite 
clothes, but it was all she could think of without flaunting herself 
openly. She preferred tight clothes to revealing clothes, and loved to 
be covered fully in cloth, whenever it was possible. She sighed, and 
picked a particularly long string from the bottom hem of her sweater. 
She tossed it aside, and looked to her watch once more.

One minute. Crunch time, she thought to herself, and finally rose up 
from her seat on the couch. She walked swiftly over to where the hotel 
door stood, and made a point to check herself in the wall mirror. Her 
hair was as normal and her lipstick had been left out from her 
appearance, she looked a bit more sociable than she usually attempted 
to. She sighed, and tilted her head to regard her appearance just once 
more. It wasn&#146;t beautiful, but...she wasn&#146;t a beautiful woman. After a 
second&#146;s thought she disregarded her appearance and turned again to 
the door, hoping and praying that her meager appearance would somehow 
be enough.

Thirty seconds. Soon she&#146;d find out if the rumor she spread worked, 
soon she&#146;d discover whether or not she could control people&#146;s emotions 
using the system. She forced down another pang of guilt, and just for 
clarification&#146;s sake went over what she told the fat detective to 
spread.

&#147;Spread a rumor that Maya,&#148; Her own words recanted in her head. &#147;Is in 
love with her best friend. She&#146;s going to tell her how she feels 
tonight, at the Shazaki hotel, at two in the morning.&#148;

Ulala felt a lump grow in her throat as she went over the words once 
again, and she could feel her fists tighten into small, white-knuckled 
balls. She bit down on her lower lip, as the clock continued to tick.

Five. She swallowed hard, and she could feel her heart begin to beat 
against her chest with every tick of the clock.

Four. Her mind reeled in the possibilities.

Three. Her mind left possibilities and ventured upon what could go 
wrong, her heart sank with the sudden suffocating thought.

Two. Her heart was raised by the thought of Maya, and what it would be 
like when she knocked on the door.

One. A knock sounded throughout the room, and Ulala nearly fell from 
her standing position. A part of her had guessed it wouldn&#146;t have 
worked, and that part seemed to take over to handle the surprise at 
the knock that came. Ulala swallowed hard again, her throat was dry 
and her lips were chapped. She needed another drink. With her mind 
somewhat blank she reached out to the doorknob, and slowly wrapped her 
fingers around the handle. With a subtle pull, she opened it, and 
there stood the object of both her rumor, and her dream.

Maya stood dressed in her normal attire, the stylish teen cowboy 
jacket with a short skirt and long leather boots. Her hair was pulled 
back in its regular fashion, as well, though in her pale hands she 
held what appeared to be a single rose. Without a word Maya looked up 
to Ulala, and slowly tilted her head to the side. She said nothing the 
entire time, and Ulala was left struggling for things to say.

&#147;Maya...&#148; She spoke quietly, and reached a hand up to gently rub 
behind her head. &#147;W...What a surprise!&#148;

Maya took a silent step forward, the only noise coming from her 
movement being the soft sound of her leather boot stepping upon the 
hotel room&#146;s carpet. She looked at Ulala with an emotionless face, and 
slowly reached out the hand that held the rose. It was bright red with 
a long green stem, and when Ulala reached out to take it she could 
feel the nubs of where thorns once were, but were obviously removed in 
the interest of comfort. She took the rose to her stomach, and looked 
at Maya with a sideways glance.

&#147;Th...thank you.&#148; She whispered, quietly, and ventured to ask what she 
was so curious about. Had the rumor worked, or was it just a misled 
vision? She spoke in a whisper, her voice meek and almost below 
hearing. &#147;Does...does this mean that you...love-&#148;

Her words were cut off as Maya took another step in the room, and 
suddenly reached out with both of her small hands. She placed them 
directly on either side of Ulala&#146;s cheeks, and then pulled the other 
girl close to her own face. Without a word or a warning Maya forced 
Ulala into a kiss, a slow, deep kiss that made the taller girl tremble 
so much the rose nearly fell from her fingers.

She could feel Maya&#146;s lips on her own, she could feel her tongue 
playing with hers. She could taste her mouth, and she could smell her 
hair. The other girl&#146;s fingertips were burning into her flesh, and 
pensively all she could do was stand there without motion, her mind 
reeling and her senses in shock. Her hands hung limp at her side, 
still grasping the rose, and her back bent crudely to meet the kiss 
she had been pulled to. She kissed back as best she could, but in her 
state of shock she was able to do little than weakly lap at Maya&#146;s 
tongue as it crossed over her own. Before long the kiss ended, and 
Maya&#146;s hands dropped down, one to her waist, and the other to Ulala&#146;s 
left hand. She took a firm grip of the taller girl&#146;s fingers and 
immediately started walking towards the bedroom, her grip firm and 
tight and her mouth still silent.

Ulala was obediently drug along with Maya, her mind still too shaken 
to accurately react to what had happened. In the state she was in she 
questioned even the single drink she had taken, for even it seemed to 
dull her senses more than the situation would permit. She stumbled 
blindly along with Maya, past the wine and past the candles, to where 
the bedroom door laid. Without a sound Maya forcefully drug her past 
the door jamb and fully into the bedroom, where her arms snapped 
around the taller girl&#146;s body and pulled her once again into a long, 
deep kiss.

Ulala managed to react this time with some effort, as she felt her 
fingers drop Maya&#146;s rose and reached up to course around the girl&#146;s 
back. Her own hands pushed down into the leather of Maya&#146;s jacket, 
while she still felt the smaller girl&#146;s touch burn into the sides of 
her cheeks. She managed to do a better job kissing back this time 
around, but even still when the kiss was broken her lips were left 
numb with the sensation of Maya that remained. She absently reached up 
to touch a finger to her lips, but before she had made contact Maya&#146;s 
hands were on her again, this time fiercely grabbing at her sweater 
and pulling it up with effort and lust.

Before long Ulala&#146;s sweater had been totally thrown aside, and the 
taller girl was left in nothing but her bra. She felt Maya&#146;s hands 
still on top of her body, this time coursing along her flesh and 
searing in long streaks down her waist and back. She trembled and let 
her arms fall limp at her sides, her head falling back and opening in 
a desperate moan. Her body trembled and her skin began to ripple with 
goose bumps, and in a second&#146;s time she could feel Maya&#146;s mouth upon 
her neck, kissing and sucking at the flesh that laid beneath her chin. 
Ulala did her best to raise her arms to grip gently at the fabric of 
Maya&#146;s coat, but each time she made an attempt to hold the fabric 
Maya&#146;s tongue coursed down along her flesh, and her ability to 
concentrate was shattered and broken.

Maya&#146;s fingers continued to rub and squeeze at certain parts of her 
anatomy, and before long the touch of fingernails locking around the 
top rim of her bra could be felt. Without effort they pulled the 
garment down, and in as quickly an instant Maya&#146;s mouth was upon them, 
her tongue pressing deep down into Ulala&#146;s flesh, leaving a thin trail 
of moisture across the upper rip of her left breast. She could feel 
fingers upon her breasts, squeezing and twisting with lust and desire, 
and every now and again her knees went weak with the touch of moisture 
that Maya&#146;s tongue continued to leave. She could feel fingertips 
coursing up and down the large muscles in her arms, teasing and 
nipping at the strong flesh before returning to the form of Ulala&#146;s 
well-developed chest.

She then felt Maya&#146;s fingers grip the button on her jeans, and her 
eyes suddenly opened wide with realization. Maya&#146;s fingers worked 
deftly at the buckle in the denim and as they did so words flashed in 
Ulala&#146;s mind, threatening and vicious words that were bent on making 
her realize what had been done. Her mouth opened wide in a gasp as she 
realized them, and she quickly brought a hand to her mouth in thought.

&#147;Not right...&#148; Her mind spoke in a whisper, a taunting sound that made 
the tall girl tremble. &#147;You&#146;re raping your best friend...she doesn&#146;t 
really love you...rapist...rapist...&#148;

Without a second thought Ulala reached out and pushed Maya away. The 
smaller girl fell back and onto the bed, and by the look in her eyes 
it seemed as if she took it as an aggressive sexual advance. She laid 
back on the bed as she regarded Ulala, and let her own hands travel 
down along her body, lewdly gripping at her breasts behind her jacket, 
and even going to the point of beginning to lift her skirt, to reveal 
what laid beneath.

&#147;N...No!&#148; Ulala nearly shouted, and quickly turned away. &#147;I can&#146;t do 
this!&#148; Her words rung out loudly, and she quickly fled from the room. 
She rushed as fast as she could towards the exit to the hotel room, 
and though she was naked from the waist up, she had to leave as 
quickly as possible. With no other option she grabbed the long, dark 
trench coat she had worn over, and wrapped it as tightly around her 
body as she could. She fled from the hotel room, and eventually the 
hotel itself. Maya was left in the bedroom alone, confused. She looked 
down to the floor where the rose laid undamaged, and reached slowly 
down to pick it up again.

Ulala&#146;s feet sounded loud as she ran across the city streets, as 
quickly as she could for the detective&#146;s office. It was two fifteen in 
the morning, but if he was any kind of investigator he would be there 
by now anyway. She had to stop the rumor, she had to do something to 
make things right again. She burst through the door to the fat 
detective&#146;s office, and breathed a long sigh of relief as she saw him 
in the far corner, putting on his coat and hat.

&#147;You!&#148; She nearly shouted, and dashed over to where he stood. She 
reached out and grabbed him hard along the collar with both hands, and 
with tears running down her face proceeded to speak in an upset tone.

&#147;I...you...rumor...&#148; Her words were hard to make out, as her tears 
were choking at her throat. &#147;You have to stop the rumor! It&#146;s not 
right...not...right!&#148; The fat man looked at her with a confused look, 
and slowly reached up to adjust the rim of his glasses.

&#147;Ulala...&#148; He spoke quietly. &#147;I haven&#146;t spread it yet.&#148; To this 
Ulala&#146;s face dropped, and a wave of confusion rocked throughout her 
body.

&#147;You what?&#148; She spoke harshly, and raised an eyebrow at the statement. 
The fat man sighed a little, and shook his head slowly.

&#147;I had a lot to do today. I&#146;m sorry, but I never got around to it.&#148; He 
reached up to put his hat atop his head, and shrugged off the hands of 
Ulala on his collar. &#147;I&#146;ll spread your rumor tomorrow Ulala, I 
promise.&#148;

&#147;N...No!&#148; Ulala quickly stated, and her eyes lit up with pleasure. She 
smiled happily and put her hands once more on the fat detective, but 
this time in a gigantic hug which made the larger man pause for a 
second. &#147;Don&#146;t spread it!&#148; Ulala shouted cheerfully, and then looked 
up to him with a smile beaming from cheek to cheek.

&#147;Don&#146;t!&#148; She reiterated, and then quickly dashed to the far end of the 
room. &#147;Don&#146;t!&#148; The word was repeated once more, and she immediately 
left the room. The door slammed hard behind her, leaving the detective 
all alone. He rolled his eyes, and worked to buttoning up his coat.

&#147;Weirdo.&#148; He commented wryly, and reached down for his umbrella.

The door to the hotel room was opened without much sound, for Ulala 
was taking every caution to move as silently as her friend did 
earlier. The room looked unchanged, but it was now two forty-five, and 
the candles were nearing the end of their lifetime. Ulala quickly 
slipped past the table and into the set apart bedroom, where a form 
was laying in bed. To her right she saw Maya&#146;s jacket and skirt neatly 
folded and set upon a chair, while her boots rested at the floor 
below. As if she had made more noise than imaginable, the form in the 
bed began to stir. Under the covers Maya rose, and she looked up at 
Ulala with a faint smile on her face. From the look of the situation 
she was bare under the covers, and as she sat up in bed she held the 
blanket across her chest, modestly covering what she so shamelessly 
flaunted earlier. Ulala could feel her cheeks burning red, and she 
stepped slowly forward into the room.

&#147;How did you know...?&#148; Was all she could ask, her hands motioning out 
in a futile gesture. &#147;How did you know...what time...and what 
place...if I didn&#146;t spread the rumor?&#148;

Maya gave no verbal reply, but instead reached down into the blanket 
and held out a piece of paper. A crumbled, slightly torn piece she 
held out for Ulala to see, and she spread it apart so she could get a 
good look. A smile played on her lips, and she watched Ulala&#146;s 
reaction with interest.

&#147;That&#146;s...&#148; The tall girl took another step forward. &#147;That&#146;s 
my...draft. Of what I was going to spread.&#148; She suddenly blushed, and 
look towards where Maya still laid.

&#147;Does this mean you love me?&#148; Her question was this time allowed to be 
asked in full, and this time the answer could be relied upon as truth. 
Ulala waited with tension as to what the answer would be, and then her 
heart leapt as she finally heard Maya speak to her that night.

&#147;That&#146;s the rumor.&#148; The black haired girl smiled gently, and opened up 
the blanket to reveal the other side of the bed. In Ulala&#146;s place a 
single rose laid, the same rose Maya had given her before. Ulala 
looked to the other girl, laying in the bed, and smiled.

Her fingers reached up, and began to undo the buttons of her jacket. 
She worked it down and let it fall to the floor, and slowly began to 
make her way into bed.

&#147;I love you too.&#148; She spoke quietly, and then slipped into Maya&#146;s 
arms.
