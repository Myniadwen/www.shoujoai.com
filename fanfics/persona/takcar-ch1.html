<h1>Taking Care</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../persona/index.html">Persona</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grandmoff.html">GrandMoff</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&#147;Do you have anything to say to your fans?&#148;

&#147;I like you,&#148; the reddish blob said.  &#147;I&#146;ve got to leave, but 
(squishy) take these 28 Tower cards (squish.)  I&#146;ll (squish) see you 
around.&#148;  With that, the demon and its friends disappeared into the 
spooky halls of the old school.

&#147;That was smooth talking, Maya-san,&#148; Baofu said.

&#147;And great timing,&#148; Ulala added.  &#147;We&#146;re too hurt to win a battle 
right now.&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s just get out of here,&#148; Katsuya urged his companions.  &#147;We need 
to heal up.  We probably ought to get new weapons, armor, and items as 
well.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m interested in new personas,&#148; Maya stated as the small group 
emerged from the drab, imposing school building.  The sun was hidden 
by mist, but the light still made them blink.  Most demons seemed to 
prefer dim places for their haunting, probably because of their dark 
natures.  These past few days had been the gloomiest that the 
black-haired reporter could remember.  But the scarce light wasn&#146;t the 
only thing; the killing they had to do and the searching for the 
mastermind behind the Jokers was very tiring.  Maya was grateful for 
anything that made her smile.  She was glad that she hadn&#146;t forgotten 
how.

The four adventurers got into Katsuya&#146;s car.  &#147;So who&#146;s up for a visit 
to Aoba Drive?&#148; the detective asked.

&#147;Not me,&#148; Ulala said.

The other three hunters turned to her in puzzlement.

&#147;I know it&#146;s selfish; I know we should keep fighting; but we all need 
a rest.  Just one day, please, before we lose our minds.&#148;

&#147;That sounds good,&#148; Maya agreed.

&#147;I&#146;m for it,&#148; Baofu added.  &#147;I&#146;ve got contacts to check and taps to 
review.&#148;

&#147;When and where should we meet?&#148; Katsuya asked.

&#147;1700 tomorrow at the Kismet lobby,&#148; Ulala suggested.

When Maya and Ulala arrived at their apartment building, they found 
two people waiting for them.  &#147;Anna-chan!  Noriko-chan!&#148; Ulala hailed 
the two girls.

&#147;Is anything wrong?&#148; Maya asked quickly.

&#147;Konnichiwa, Amano-san,&#148; Anna said.  &#147;No, nothing&#146;s wrong.  Noriko and 
I wanted to offer our help and our thanks.  We&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;I couldn&#146;t possibly accept your help,&#148; Maya said firmly.  &#147;It is far 
too dangerous.&#148;

&#147;But we owe you!&#148; Noriko said.  &#147;I don&#146;t like owing anyone.&#148;

&#147;Maya, I&#146;ll talk with them,&#148; Ulala offered.  &#147;Why don&#146;t you head down 
to the armory and get that new protective suit you were talking about?  
Leave everything to me.&#148;

&#147;Okay,&#148; Maya agreed.  She got into her car.

&#147;And you two come with me,&#148; Ulala said, leading the two students into 
the building.  &#147;You are right.  So is she.  We all owe Maya something.  
However, you cannot help us fight our battles.&#148;

&#147;There must be something we can do,&#148; Noriko pressed.

&#147;Have a seat.  Do you want tea?&#148;

&#147;Yes, please, Serizawa-san.&#148;

&#147;Yes, ma&#146;am.  I&#146;ll make it,&#148; Anna volunteered.

Soon, the three ladies were sitting in the living room, sipping their 
tea.  &#147;Maya and I are just taking a bit of a break.  But that is where 
you can help.  I wanted to do a few things for her, but I can only do 
so much.  What she needs is relaxation, you see.  Could you help me 
with that?&#148;

Even before she finished the question, Ulala could see Anna blushing 
and Noriko turning her eyes to the ground in embarrassment.  This was 
just as she&#146;d expected, and she allowed a hint of a smile to appear on 
her face.  Yes, they would help.

&#147;O-of course, we will help,&#148; Noriko stammered.

&#147;What do you need us to do?&#148; Anna asked carefully.

&#147;Dinner is very important,&#148; the pink-haired woman answered.  &#147;Does 
either of you know how to prepare Korean bulgoki?&#148;

&#147;I do,&#148; Noriko replied cheerfully.

&#147;Good, that&#146;s her favorite dish.  I&#146;ll help you get started, ne.  
Please, make enough for the four of us.&#148;  She showed the dark-haired 
girl around the kitchen and set out the ingredients for the meal.

&#147;Now Anna and I will get started on another task, but I&#146;ll be back,&#148; 
Ulala promised.

&#147;What&#146;re we doing?&#148; Anna inquired of her tall hostess.

&#147;We&#146;re going to clean the place and then get it looking, sounding, and 
smelling like somewhere a person can unwind.  Let&#146;s get started.&#148;  
They cleared the floor and washed the laundry.  &#147;You know, from the 
way Noriko&#146;s acting, I&#146;d say she has a crush on Maya.  Have you 
noticed anything like that?&#148;

Anna&#146;s face turned a bit pink and she nodded.  &#147;I&#146;d say some of those 
feelings are present.  Maya and you three saved her&#133;&#148;

Although the room had looked awful, Ulala and Anna got it cleaned 
rapidly.  &#147;Great,&#148; Ulala pronounced.  &#147;Now we&#146;re ready for the next 
step.  Here are some candles.&#148;  The pink-haired woman quickly 
explained how Anna should continue setting up the apartment, then she 
went to check on Noriko.

&#147;I think it&#146;s coming along really well,&#148; the slim girl said.  She was 
practically glowing with pride.

&#147;Hai, you&#146;re doing a terrific job,&#148; Ulala said as she moved nearer to 
the stove.  &#147;You&#146;re Anna&#146;s good friend.  Does it seem to you as though 
she&#146;s a little&#133;in love with Maya?&#148;

&#147;You are really perceptive,&#148; Noriko said quietly.  &#147;Yes, she is.  Who 
can blame her?&#148;

&#147;Wow,&#148; Ulala said, raising her eyebrows.

&#147;I-I didn&#146;t m-mean that the way it sounded,&#148; the young lady hastily 
covered.

&#147;Yes you did.&#148;  Ulala gently lifted Noriko&#146;s chin, smiling into her 
eyes warmly, embarrassing her even further.  &#147;It&#146;s all right.  I&#146;m 
glad that you and Anna are here.  I really want you to help me 
revitalize her.  She&#146;d never let on how exhausted she is.  She&#146;s a 
strong, giving person.  I want to give back to her tonight.  You will 
help me take care of her, right?&#148;

&#147;Of course we will.&#148;

Maya entered the apartment.  Her eyes widened.  This didn&#146;t seem like 
the right place.  But there was Ulala, beckoning her forward.  She 
stepped into the living room.

&#147;May I take that bag you&#146;re carrying?&#148; Anna asked a little shyly.

Maya hadn&#146;t expected to see the athletic girl still here.  She nodded 
and handed over the garment she&#146;d bought.

&#147;I invited them to eat with us,&#148; Ulala explained.  &#147;Ne, this is 
supposed to be like a small vacation.  How about letting others take 
care of you for a change?&#148;

Noriko stuck her head out of the dining room.  &#147;Dinner is waiting,&#148; 
the genki girl announced.  Was Maya imagining the pretty blush on her 
cheeks?

&#147;Let&#146;s eat,&#148; Ulala said, guiding her friend toward the prepared 
dinner.

The four women seated themselves at the low table.  &#147;No talking about 
work,&#148; Ulala said.  &#147;No personas or demons, either.  Just normal 
stuff.&#148;

&#147;Normal?&#148; Maya said hopefully.  &#147;I&#146;d like that.  First, Noriko-chan, 
this is excellent food!  You are a wonderful cook.&#148;

Noriko&#146;s cheeks blazed, but she held Maya&#146;s gaze.  &#147;It&#146;s nothing.  I 
just wish I could do more for you.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s very sweet,&#148; Maya responded.  &#147;The place looks great, too.  Is 
that your doing, Anna-chan?&#148;

&#147;Most of it was Serizawa-san&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;Nonsense!&#148; Ulala protested, brushing her red bangs away from her 
golden eyes.  &#147;I just helped a little.&#148;

&#147;Arigatou gozimasu, all of you,&#148; Maya said warmly, looking at each of 
her friends in turn.  &#147;I appreciate it greatly.

&#147;I&#146;ve been hoping for a conversation with you two.  Noriko-chan, I 
understand that you and Anna-chan are on the track team at Seven 
Sisters?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s a lot better than I am,&#148; the girl with the long black hair 
demurred.  &#147;It&#146;s fun.  I really enjoy running.&#148;

&#147;Did you ever do it?&#148; Anna asked.

&#147;We were both in gymnastics,&#148; Maya said, pointing her thumb at her 
best friend.  &#147;With her martial arts training, she was a natural.  She 
was team captain for three years.&#148;

&#147;And we had a lot of good times,&#148; Ulala added.  &#147;Once, when we 
competed at Nagoya&#133;&#148;

The four ladies talked, ate, and laughed until the food was gone.

&#147;Mm, that was delicious,&#148; Maya purred, stretching her arms above her 
head.

&#147;We haven&#146;t even begun yet,&#148; Ulala stated.  She rose from the table.  
All three women were watching her, wondering what she had in mind.  
&#147;We&#146;re going to make you look shiny and feel new.  First, you need a 
nice hot bath.&#148;

One of the best things about the apartment was its giant bath.  Ulala 
ran the water and added the bubbles while Maya changed into her robe.  
As soon as the violet-eyed reporter had left, Ulala told Anna and 
Noriko to change into two robes that she&#146;d laid out and to wait for 
her in her room.  The girls suspiciously agreed.  A minute later, Maya 
came back to the bath.

&#147;Hop in,&#148; Ulala urged.  &#147;I&#146;ll be back shortly.&#148;

&#147;Nani?&#148; Maya asked, but Ulala was already halfway to her room.

&#147;Here&#146;s the plan,&#148; the tall, red-haired woman said as she quickly 
changed into her robe.  &#147;We&#146;ll make this just like a spa.  We&#146;re going 
to wash her, dry her, give her a pedicure, and just plain pamper her.&#148;

The students blushed to their soles.  But they followed Ulala without 
question.

Maya heard the doorknob and turned in surprise.  In a flash, Ulala 
strode into the room, with Noriko and Anna close behind her.  &#147;Hey!  
What are&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;Relax,&#148; Ulala soothed.  I said we were going to take care of you.  
All you need to do is lie back and let us spoil you rotten.&#148;

Maya didn&#146;t argue.  She did enjoy spas, and pretending to have one in 
her own home was an irresistible offer.  She waited to hear Ulala&#146;s 
instructions.

&#147;Noriko-chan, get in and wash her hair.  Anna-chan, you&#146;re in charge 
of her feet.&#148;

Anna took off her robe and climbed into the huge bathtub, positioning 
her legs on either side of Maya&#146;s legs.  Noriko slipped out of her 
robe and sat right behind Maya.  The violet-eyed woman immediately 
leaned back against the younger girl&#146;s chest.  Swallowing, hoping that 
Maya wouldn&#146;t notice how stiff her nipples were, Noriko began washing 
Maya&#146;s shoulder-length black hair.  Anna was trying hard to focus on 
Maya&#146;s feet, but Noriko and Maya looked so beautiful together, and 
Maya looked so carefree, leaning back with her eyes closed.  Anna felt 
a twinge of envy before she started working her soothing magic on 
Maya&#146;s feet.

Soft orchestral music and lilac incense drifted through the air; 
Ulala&#146;s doing, no doubt.  The tall redhead threw three towels into the 
dryer and set out for Maya&#146;s bedroom, double-checking all her 
preparations.  At last, she returned to the bathroom.

The girls were almost done with Maya.  They were doing their jobs very 
well; the young reporter looked very content, almost ready to fall 
asleep.

&#147;Arigatou gozimasu,&#148; Maya murmured.  &#147;I can&#146;t thank you enough.  This 
is all too much, but I really needed it.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s our pleasure,&#148; Anna replied.

&#147;And nothing is too much for you,&#148; Noriko added.

Ulala enjoyed watching the scene, but it couldn&#146;t go on forever.  
Besides, there were more parts to her plan.  &#147;Are you ready to come 
out?&#148; she asked after several moments.

&#147;I think so,&#148; Maya answered drowsily.  The girls looked rather 
grudging, but Ulala knew they wouldn&#146;t stay upset for long.  She 
fetched the towels, which were now quite warm, and helped Maya out of 
the tub when she returned.  Ulala dried Maya carefully, noting Anna 
and Noriko practically beside themselves with jealousy.  The 
fortuneteller wordlessly wrapped Maya in the large, fuzzy towel and 
led her to the bedroom, motioning for the two students to follow.

Ulala had Maya stand in front of the mirror.  &#147;How are we doing so 
far?&#148; she kidded.  &#147;It&#146;s not over.  Anna, could you brush her hair?  
Noriko, would you help me apply this skin treatment to her body?&#148;

Noriko was as red as a beet, but she followed Ulala&#146;s lead, rubbing 
the cr&egrave;me into Maya&#146;s skin.  Someone&#146;s self-control is bound to falter 
any second, Ulala thought gleefully.

Maya was in bliss.  Four hands were slowly massaging her body while 
two were gently brushing her hair.  She thought she could stay this 
way for hours.  She became aware of desire subtly building within her.  
Once she noticed it, she could tell that she wasn&#146;t the only one 
becoming aroused.

Ulala was proud of her two young prot&eacute;g&eacute;s; they both grew aware of the 
situation and acted simultaneously.  Anna leaned in and kissed Maya&#146;s 
ear softly; Noriko planted a kiss on the center of Maya&#146;s ribcage; it 
was almost as if they had choreographed it.  A sigh escaped Maya&#146;s 
lips.  She kept her eyelids shut.

&#147;We love you, Maya-chan.&#148;  Ulala was only whispering, but all three 
women heard her low voice.  &#147;Let us make love to you.&#148;

It was as though she had spoken a powerful enchantment.

Noriko and Anna shed their towels.  Maya eased Ulala&#146;s robe off her 
broad shoulders.  The four women&#151;the four lovers&#151;pulled each other to 
the bed.  No one said a word.  Maya&#146;s luminous purple eyes showed her 
delight as the three enamored young ladies delicately, sensually, 
hypnotically, carefully loved her.  All of her, every bit.  Their 
kisses and caresses brought her to the edge and then way past it.  She 
called each of their names many times.  Nothing had ever prepared her 
for this.  Nothing compared to this.  I&#146;m not a lesbian, a tiny part 
of her mind told her as she neared her fifth climax.

I am now, the rest of her mind yelled back.

After a long while, Maya was able to reciprocate.  She turned her 
attention to Anna.  Noriko and Ulala followed her lead and the 
short-haired girl was soaring in a mist of ecstasy in moments.  
Eventually, Noriko became the center of attention.  Then it was 
Ulala&#146;s turn.  Then Maya was the focus again.  At some point, the 
lovers began pairing off.  No one was thinking anymore, just feeling, 
just following their urges, giving free rein to their instincts, 
letting their senses guide them.  The sun had risen before they 
finally fell asleep, entangled with each other, feeling pure 
satisfaction.

&#147;You two look refreshed,&#148; Baofu remarked when he and Katsuya met Ulala 
and Maya.

&#147;A day can make all the difference,&#148; Ulala said with a lascivious 
wink.

Maya turned red.</pre>
