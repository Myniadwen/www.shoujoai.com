<h2>a <a href="../rulerose/index.html">Rule of the Rose</a>

<a href="../rulerose/secretletter-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Old man winter blow in rather quickly and with November in full bloom 
the girl found herself shivering in the night with only a single blanket 
to keep her warm. She started wearing her coat all the time, even to 
sleep. Even with a fire burning away in the heath above her room it did 
nothing to cut through the cold in the dead of the night.  Now a new 
horror overtook her mind as the fear of dying of a cold set in.

After lunch one day she glanced around to find she had very little to do 
that day. She had managed to clean up most of the house and only a fresh 
coat of paint would help the house now. 

&quot;Can I draw in front of the fireplace today?&quot; She asked Greg as he 
finished his sandwich. 

&quot;Alright.&quot; He nodded his head, no matter how much she cleaned the house 
the man never seemed to keep himself clean and she wondered if he ever 
used the bath. It took her an entire day to scrub the bottom clean and 
was proud of her efforts. She only wished that she could bring up the 
matter of the man&#39;s smell up to him, but always backed down. 

She walked down the hall and into the basement and entered her room with 
the intent to gather some paper and pencils. Not feeling like going back 
upstairs just at that moment she flopped upon the mattress and stared up 
at the ceiling. The bed squeaked against the strain of her weight and 
Jennifer reminded herself to try to take it easy with the bed. She did 
not know how much its frame could take and she dreaded that as she grew 
the frame would no longer be able to take her weight and it would 
collapse on her in the middle of the night. She pulled the teddy bear 
into her arms as she continued to watch the beams overhead, when she 
suddenly noticed someone watching her from the window above her. 

Startled, she sprung to her feet and faced the new arrival, knelling in 
the window was Wendy, looking down at the girl. Jennifer leapt onto the 
bed and grinned happily at the girl. Jennifer had only seen Wendy in 
passing over the last few months and wished she could break free of the 
man just for one moment to spend some time with the girl. However, he 
kept a very short leash on her and on one occasion she received a swift 
smack across the face for venturing out of his sight in a store. So, 
whenever they went out she made sure to stay close to the man, even 
though in her heart she wanted to run off and play with Wendy in the 
Rose Garden.

Wendy lightly tapped upon the glass with a finger. 

Jennifer pulled on the handle at the bottom of the window frame to ease 
it opened a crack. Metal elbows kept the window from opening only far 
enough for the girl to reach her hand through, &quot;Wendy? Is that really 
you?&quot; She inquired in a whisper, not wanting to alert Greg to the girl&#39;s 
appearance. 

&quot;Hello, Mr. Joshua.&quot; She greeted with a smile upon her face, &quot;I have 
something for you.&quot; She pulled a folded piece of paper from the pocket 
of her overcoat and pushed it through the crack. 

Jennifer quickly snatched up the paper before it fell, &quot;What is this?&quot; 
She inquired curiously. 

&quot;A letter for my prince.&quot; She stated with a flush, then quickly glanced 
around, &quot;I have to go.&quot; Before leaving she placed her hand upon the 
window and Jennifer mimicked the girl. With a giggle Wendy ran off 
around the house and vanished from sight.  

Jennifer pushed the window shut and sunk back down to her bed, her back 
against the wall. She turned the folded paper in her hands several times 
and a giddy of laugher escaped her lips and she quickly clapped her 
hands over her mouth, listening to make sure Greg was not coming. Only 
when she was certain that he was not on the move did she unfold the 
paper and read the words upon it. 

&lt;i&gt;&quot;To Mr. Joshua, the bear in distress.

It is Wendy. I always watch you from the sky. Mr. Joshua, why are you 
trapped down there?&quot;&lt;/i&gt; 

&quot;Mr. Joshua...&quot; Jennifer read aloud. The words slipped over her tongue 
like silt, leaving a bad taste in her mouth. She was growing tired of 
this game of Greg&#39;s and wished more and more to be the girl she used to 
be. She rolled over on the bed onto her back and held the letter at arms 
reach. Wendy had the loveliest script that Jennifer had ever seen. 
Letters slipped between printing to handwriting in such a smooth manner 
that they seemed to work together nicely, in Jennifer&#39;s mind that is. 

She mulled over how to reply. She did not wish to lie to the girl for 
fear that Wendy would want nothing more to do with her, if her secret 
was later got out. She did want to thank Wendy, for the letter and for 
the rose. Rolling off the bed she pulled the chair up to the desk and 
pulled out a piece of parchment. Greg had added some pencils to her 
growing assortment of drawing utensils; as such she had no problem 
finding something to write with. She took out a sharpened pencil from 
inside the desk and set it to the paper and began to write: 

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Dear Wendy, my visitor in the window,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; She paused for a moment. 
Did that sound to strange? She was not sure, but decided to go with it. 

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Thank you so much for writing to me. The man calls me Joshua, but my 
name is
Jennifer. I&#39;ve been in this room ever since he saved me. He&#39;s a nice 
person...
But he won&#39;t let me leave.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; 

She scanned her letter and considered saying more, but wanted to know 
how the girl would react to her confessions before continuing on. She 
did not wish to bore or scare the girl away so quickly. If this girl 
truly wished to be her friend then hopefully she will return. Jennifer 
so wished that Wendy would respond for the loneliness in her heart was 
beginning to cause it to rot just like the rose on her desk. 
									
Carefully she folded the letter and placed it under the corner of the 
bed, awaiting her princess&#39;s return.
