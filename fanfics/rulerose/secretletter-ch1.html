<h1>Secret Letters from the Rose Garden (part 1 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rulerose/index.html">Rule of the Rose</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Warning: This story takes a linear telling the tale of Jennifer&#146;s life. 
From the days she spent with the strange man to her time in The Rose 
Garden. It may spoil the story for some, but for those unable to obtain 
the game due to it&#146;s banning in several places it will be another way to 
experience this beautiful and tragic love story. 

Authors notes: This story is based on the letters that were exchanged 
between Wendy and Jennifer in the game &quot;Rule of the Rose&quot; during the 
months of November 1929 - Jan 1930, before Jennifer was taken to the 
Orphanage, where most of the game occurred. Most of these events were 
just grazed upon in the game and I wanted to tell the tale of their 
love. You need not know anything about the game because this part took 
place before anything else in the game, however it may spoil a few 
surprises in the game so be forewarned. Enjoy   

June 1929

Flames flickered like tongues of light before the girl&#39;s eyes as she lay 
amongst a forest of twisted steal. She tried to move only to find her 
leg hurt and a wave of dizziness overcame her. She knelt amongst the 
wreckage, holding a hand to her head, as her vision blurred in and out. 
When she began to regain her balance she pulled her tiny hand away from 
her head to find it coated in crimson. She looked down at her leg to 
discover a long cut ran along the length of her left calf, tearing 
through her white stockings and soaking them with blood.

Terrified the girl glanced around, becoming at once aware of her 
surroundings. All around she could see flames leaping about and 
distorted fragments of metal that formed jagged looking claws, giant 
hands that appeared to be reaching towards the heavens like some dying 
soul reaching out to god. Dizzily she staggered and stumbled about the 
carnage, favouring her good leg and unsure of what it was she was 
seeking.

&quot;H... hello?&quot; She called out over the crackle of flames. Suddenly her 
foot fell upon something soft and she slipped. She reached out for one 
of the many spires of metal that jutted out of the ground in hopes to 
stop her decent. Sharp hot steel cut through the flesh of her palm 
making her recoil from the pillar as if it were a snake. Backwards she 
pin wheeled until she could no longer keep her balanced and tumbled down 
a hill of rubbish, hitting the bottom with a meaty thud. Slowly she rose 
to a seated position, her hand set upon something soft and warm. She 
glanced down and lifted her hand to find the face of a man staring 
blankly up at her. A sheet of metal was lodged in his throat and blood 
spluttered from the wound as he tried to speak. 

&quot;J... Jen... jennif...&quot; A deep red bubble formed between his lips and 
burst. 

The girl crawled away to find she had landed on a pile of bodies. 
Hundreds of dead lay scattered about with flame crawling over their 
clothes and lapping at their skin, filling her nostrils with the stench 
of burnt flesh. Her foot became caught upon something and she glanced 
down to find a man had grabbed hold of her shoe, smearing blood across 
her only clean leg. The girl let out a scream that filled the night air. 

Jennifer woke up from her nightmare with a start and glanced around 
herself. No more were the flickering firelight or the blood covered 
faces of the dead. She now sat safely upon the back seat of a bus as it 
travelled through the forested areas of England, leaving London far 
behind her. It had only been a week since her parents had been laid to 
rest and her small mind still could not even remember them to be able to 
grieve. To her the people in those graves were as unknown as the other 
graves surrounding them. Her only reminder that the dreams were more 
then just that was the bandage upon her left hand and calf. She had 
survived the airship crash with only a few minor scraps and bruises; 
something of a miracle as police and doctors told her. 

Her gazed moved from her hand to a brown tag that hung around her neck. 
She had been packaged like any other letter; the tag stated her name and 
destination in large bold print. She was lucky to have been educated 
enough to be able to read the simply words upon the brownish yellow 
paper and scowled at it disapprovingly. 

Name: Jennifer
Bound for: Rose Garden Orphanage, Outer London, England

No last name accompanied hers. Nothing to tell her where she came from 
or who she was. She wished she could remember who she was. The only 
memories she held were those of that fire filled night and the faces 
staring up at her, accusing her of being the only one to survive. She 
had been told many times how lucky she was to be alive, but she did not 
feel it. If she was lucky then why was she being sent to an Orphanage so 
far outside of the city? Why couldn&#39;t she stay at her Aunt? She got a 
chance to spend a few days at the large estate before it was decided 
that she should be shipped of to somewhere else. That somewhere was Rose 
Garden Orphanage. She let the tag fall to her chest in disgust. 

She looked at the suitcase that sat upon the seat beside of her. Her 
aunt had showed up that morning with the case in her hands and placed it 
before the girl, telling her to get dressed for she was going on a trip. 
If she had known that she was being travelling on such a dingy bus she 
wouldn&#39;t have picked the best looking dress out of the case to wear that 
day. It was a pale blue dress that she was told her mother had bought 
her for her eleventh birthday. Knowing this made her despise getting it 
dirty all the more. She squirmed in her seat as she tried, with all her 
might, to pull her brown overcoat under her legs enough as to keep the 
dress from touching the seat. 

The sun drifted off in the distance. It peeked between the many trees 
that surrounded the road as the bus slowly rolled along, winking at the 
girl as she travelled to her new home. A couple of people got on and got 
off again, but no one seemed to notice the small child seated alone in 
the back of the bus. She began to wonder just how far into the 
countryside she was being taken. Again she read her tag. 

What kind of place was Rose Garden Orphanage she wondered? Did they 
really have roses or was it just a name that looked pretty. She 
sometimes pondered about things of this nature with her innocent 
curiosity.  She found that things are not allows what they seemed and 
more so when it came to the name of places. On the way out of the city 
she spotted a shop with a sign announcing that it was the Blue Bird 
Caf&eacute;, but she saw no sign of any birds around aside from the pigeons on 
the street. Who would call a caf&eacute; &quot;Blue Bird&quot; if there were not any Blue 
Birds around? The question puzzled her and made her try to imagine what 
the Orphanage would be like, but since she had never seen an orphanage 
before she had very little to go by. 

Her mind drifted over her thoughts as the sun slowly moved behind the 
trees and was replaced by moon&#39;s light. Before long the bus came to a 
stop and the bus driver turned in his seat. 

&quot;Rose Garden Orphanage.&quot; He called out to the back of the bus. 

The girl was startled by the man&#39;s words and sat up straight. 

The driver got out of his seat and took off his cap, &quot;This is your stop 
little girl.&quot; He called out to Jennifer. 

&quot;O.. oh..!&quot; Jennifer got up from her seat and pulled her suitcase along 
with her. It was a rather large case and in her hands it grazed the 
floor of the bus if she did not lean away from it and grip it with both 
hands. Slowly she moved down the aisle of seats to the front of the bus 
where the driver tipped his cap at her and gave her a friendly smile. 

&quot;You will find the orphanage just down that path there.&quot; He stated, 
pointing down a long dark path next to the bus stop, &quot;Try not to get 
lost along your way. There should be someone coming to pick you up soon 
enough.&quot; He assured the girl.

Jennifer stepped off the bus, having to make a small jump at the last 
step to the gravel road below, and turned to face the driver, &quot;T... 
thank you...&quot; She said in a shy, timid voice. 

Again the driver tipped his hat and closed the bus&#39;s doors before 
driving off. 

Jennifer watched the taillights disappear into the distance. She tried 
to will the bus to stop, wished for it to turn back around and pick her 
back up. When it did not return she realized that this truly was to be 
her new home and she had better get used to the idea fast because it was 
not likely to change. She recalled a comic book of a little red haired 
orphan girl, but could not remember where she heard of the story. All 
she did remember was that the girl spent awhile at the orphanage before 
finding a home. 

Trying to not let despair take her so quickly she glanced around her 
surroundings to see what kind of situation she was in for. She found 
herself standing beneath a lamppost that shone a circle of light upon 
the ground. All around her she could see a dark thick forest that 
frightened the girl immensely. 

She stared down the long path to the orphanage to seen no other lights 
in the distances. The trees bent overhead like long fingers reaching up 
in an attempt to blot out the sky. The thought of venturing down that 
dark path alone made her even more afraid and the thought of those trees 
swallowing her up whole entered her young mind, quickly changing it. To 
afraid to move she sat upon the bus stop bench with her suitcase upon 
her lap and waited, in hopes that someone would remember that she was 
there and would come fetch her. 

She was not sure how much time had gone by before she heard the sounds 
of movement down the road, but it had been long enough for the moon to 
move high overhead. Something was approaching her, not from the 
direction of the orphanage, but from the opposite direction the bus had 
disappeared to. From down the road Jennifer watched as a light bobbed 
its way through the darkness and soon a mysterious man entered the 
circle of light that she sat in. He wore a long grey coat covered in 
dirt and a newspaper boy&#39;s hat atop his head, in one hand he held an oil 
lantern that swung from his hand by a wire handle affixed to the top. 
After sitting in the dark of the night, with only a street light 
overhead to protect her from the creatures of the night, the sight of 
another human seemed like a dream come true to the little girl. 

The man spotted Jennifer and gazed at her curiously, then slowly, almost 
cautiously, approached her. Uncertain of whom this man was she decided 
to sit perfectly still and see what the man would do. The man sat down 
on the bench beside her, setting his lantern beside himself at the edge 
of the bench and let out a slight groan as if his body protested the 
idea of sitting. 

At first he stared out into the darkness across the road with his hands 
folded before himself and his elbows resting upon his knees. It was 
almost as if he was not aware of the girl, but she noticed him glance at 
her a couple of time. Only quick peeks, as if he was not sure if she was 
real or not. The way he looked at her made her feel uneasy and she slid 
closer to the opposite end of the bench and glanced down the dark path 
to the orphanage, praying that someone would come to get her soon. 

&quot;I have been looking all over for you, Joshua.&quot; The man suddenly stated 
with a tone of disappointment. His voice was rough and dry as if the 
very dirt on his clothes had coated his throat too. 

The girl spun around to find the man&#39;s had moved closer to her and was 
baring down over her, &quot;Wha?&quot; She inquired uncertainly. 

 &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have left your room,&quot; He stated irritatedly, &quot;you&#39;ve 
made me so frightened and worried, dear Joshua. You know not to leave 
your room at night. It isn&#39;t safe.&quot; 

&quot;But...&quot; She tried to move away from the man to find herself quickly 
running out of bench and fell off the edge, causing her suitcase to fall 
to the ground. 

Suddenly the man grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her close, &quot;How 
many times do we have to have this talk?&quot; He demanded with a snarl. 

Jennifer shook her head in confusion. &quot;I... I&#39;m... I&#39;m not...&quot; 

The man violently pulled on her arm, causing the girl to slid across the 
bench until she was face to face with the man, &quot;Don&#39;t try to make a fuss 
or I&#39;ll have to grind you up, my little pea.&quot;

Jennifer could smell the rank stench of earth upon the man&#39;s cloths and 
liquor upon his breath. She tried to comprehend what it was the man was 
talking about, but her mind could not think clearly for fear had ripped 
it of rational thought. All she could do was stare at the man&#39;s sad dark 
eyes and pray that he did not intend to harm her. 

&quot;It&#39;s time for bed, Joshua.&quot; The man stated simply, then slung the girl 
over his shoulder and picked up his lantern. He stared down at the 
girl&#39;s suitcase, then took it in hand and started back down the road the 
way he came.   

Jennifer tried to understand what it was that was happening to her. Why 
did this man would think her to be Joshua? Her long hair and clothes 
should have told the man that she was a girl and not a boy. She 
considered protesting this when her eyes spotted the butt end of a 
pistol poking out of the man&#39;s jacket pocket. Fear welled up inside of 
her as she stared down at the devise as it bobbed against his hip as he 
walked. She did not know how she knew what the object was or why she 
should fear it, but the mere sight of it made her relinquish all will to 
fight back and she rested limply upon the man&#39;s shoulder. 

The man patted Jennifer on the back, &quot;You get some rest.&quot; He suggested, 
&quot;We will be home soon enough.&quot; 

He travelled along the road until he came across another path through 
the trees. He journeyed along the path surefooted, not stumbling once 
upon the many rocks that littered the path. From her spot Jennifer 
watched the path roll out under the man&#39;s feet and after a short time 
bushes of the most beautiful roses replaced the forest. Jennifer 
marvelled at the sight of the many flowers and breathed in the wonderful 
scent of the roses. She noticed an opening in the wall of flowers made 
of a white wooden archway that lead into the centre of a large rose 
garden. In the distance, beyond the garden, she could see the lights of 
a large building that she suspected was the Orphanage that she was 
supposed to be fast asleep within at this moment. 

Disappointedly she watched the building grow smaller as the man took her 
in a different direction and she began to wonder where it was the man 
was taking her. Before long they came to a small house deep in the 
woods. A small wooden fence surrounded a square plot of land surrounded 
by overhanging trees. The gate opened with a slight creak of protest as 
the man passed through it and he headed up four rickety stairs to an 
old, weather worn patio. He set his lantern upon a chair and the 
suitcase on the ground, and then fished out a set of keys from his 
pocket. 

The girl allowed her eyes scan the porch in an attempt to gain a sense 
of her surroundings. The porch was made of rotting grey wood that had 
holes all about and the girl was sure she could see the eyes of some 
furry creature staring up at her from its hiding place beneath the floor 
boards. The patio itself stretched out across the entire front of the 
house and around the sides, its railing appeared to have been put 
together haphazardly with planks of wood off on odd angels. It made 
Jennifer wonder if the craftsman was blind or in such a rush that he did 
not care much about their placement. The front of the house seemed 
rundown with its faded wood appearing warp and buckle in places. 
Jennifer noticed a double hung window off to her right, its glass thick 
with so much grim that it made it hard to peer inside. To a casual 
observer the entire build would appear to be abandoned for many years 
and Jennifer would have thought the same if she had not been with the 
man at that moment and watched as he unlocked the door with a large iron 
key. 

The man opened the front door and stepped inside, remembering to take 
his lamp and the suitcase with him. He set the objects to the side of 
the door and quickly closed the door behind him, locking it tight. Only 
when he was sure the door was secure did he set the girl down at his 
side, still keeping a tight grip upon her hand. 

&quot;It&#39;s time for bed, my little pea.&quot; He stated as he flicked on a light 
switch causing a lamp, sitting upon a table at the far end of the hall 
to their left, to come to life, filling the hall with a pale yellow 
glow. They stood in a long hall with peeling red walls that had not seen 
a coat of paint in many a year. Jennifer stared in astonishment at the 
state of decay that the house was in. The man did not allow her long to 
take look around before he pulled her down the hall to the left and then 
around an elbow to the left. 

As they moved through the halls the man started to recite a strange 
little poem: 

&quot;Stray dog walks the streets each day,
Collection the peas as he walks to and fro;&quot;

The girl stared up at the man as he drew her deeper into the house. 

&quot;Big peas, little peas, every which kind of pea.&quot; He continued. 

They passed a couple of doors before they took another left, passing the 
open door of a washroom and then approached an intersection.

&quot;Come Monday, he finds a pea
Come Tuesday, he bags the pea.
Come Wednesday, he shows the pea to his son.&quot;

The man did not hesitate at the &quot;t&quot; junction as he quickly moved down 
the right hall to the end where Jenn noticed a back exit with a glass 
window in the middle. She tried to peer through the window into the back 
yard, but the man would not allow it. He opened a door along the right 
wall near the end of the hall and dragged the girl through the door. 

&quot;Come Thursday, the pea kicks and screams.
Come Friday he grinds the pea.&quot;

Jennifer swallowed at the sound of those lines. She did not want to know 
what he was implying with his song and began to fear for her life. Her 
mind raced as she was forced down a set of rickety stairs into an earthy 
basement. 

&quot;Come Saturday, he buries the pea outside; the pea is in the ground.
And by Sunday, it can&#39;t be found.&quot;&quot;

Jennifer&#39;s nostrils filled with the rich smell of earth as they 
descended into the cellar and across the dirt floor. In the back of the 
cellar was a single door in the middle of a long wall. The man opened 
the door and drew Jennifer within. 

&quot;Get changed into your nightshirt and get some sleep.&quot; The man 
commanded, &quot;I&#39;ll wake you in the morning. Good night, young pea.&quot; 
Without another word he left the room and Jennifer could hear the bolt 
click in the lock, assuring her escape would never occur. 

Jennifer approached the door and took hold of the knob. She gave it a 
quick twist to find it indeed was locked tight. She leaned against the 
door and slide to the ground. A shudder filled her as she thought about 
the man&#39;s poem and what he meant by calling her a pea.

Unsure what to do she buried her face in her knees and cried herself to 
sleep, curling up upon the damp earthen floor, the poem running circles 
in her mind.
