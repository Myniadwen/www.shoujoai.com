<h1>Secret Letters from the Rose Garden (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rulerose/index.html">Rule of the Rose</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../rulerose/secretletter-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Jennifer took not time to prepare breakfast and after quietly eating 
them together the two of them went their separate ways. The man left 
Jennifer to the rest of the dishes as he headed outside to tend to the 
garden. She listened carefully as she heard the man unlock and relock 
the back door. With a sigh of disappointment she went about the task of 
spreading some kind of order to the chaos that was all about. 

She approached the sink and poured in more hot water, which she had 
heated while eating. Her gaze moved to the window, and the man as he 
moved about the garden. She watched attentively as he dug holes in the 
yards and planted what he called &quot;peas&quot;. Jenn was not sure if there were 
any real peas and she could not see any plants growing from the earth so 
discarded the notion that there were any peas at all.

It would take her much of the morning to wash ever dish, but she felt 
compelled to do so. Before long lunch crept up on her and the man 
returned to inquire about a meal. Before he could say much more then, 
&quot;Do you want lunch?&quot; The girl rushed over to the refrigerator and opened 
it.

She had taken an inventory of its contents during her cleaning, tossing 
out what looked bad and searching for any other hidden dishes. She 
quickly retrieved a loaf of slightly stale bread and turned to a small 
toaster oven, she had discovered the device hiding amongst the insanity 
and cleaned it up as well. Popping two slices of bread into the machine 
she pushed the plunger, then took out some butter and jam from the 
fridge and placed it on the counter. 

The man peered inside of the fridge, as the girl rushed about the 
kitchen, marvelling at how clean it was, &quot;Are we that low on food?&quot; He 
inquired curiously. 

Jennifer nodded as she took down two small plates and pointed to a small 
pad of paper on the counter. She had discovered some pencils and a pad 
in one of the draws and used it to jot notes down upon, &quot;I wrote a few 
things that might be needed when we go to market.&quot; She said, distracted 
in her search for a knife. 

The man picked up the pad and stared at the items on the list, &quot;That is 
some list.&quot; He scratched the back of his head; &quot;I will go to the market 
after lunch. You will have to stay in your room for the time being.&quot; He 
stated as he sat down at the table, still mulling over the list. 

Jennifer felt disappointed by this notion, but realized that she would 
have to get his respect before she could leave the house, &quot;A... 
alright...&quot; She agreed. The toast popped and she placed the slices on 
the top of the plates. She quickly spread some butter and jelly upon the 
bread then brought them over to the man. 

&quot;I will only be gone for a short bit.&quot; He stated, taking the toast in 
his hands and biting into it. 

&quot;I guess I will take a nap while you are gone.&quot; Jennifer said quietly, 
she had her heart set on going to the market. If anything else she 
needed some air, the man kept all the windows shut tight and as such the 
late June sun had heated up the roof and the entire house. After several 
hours over a hot sink of dishes she was really looking forward to going 
outside for some fresh air. 

Seeing the drawn look upon the girl&#39;s face the man set his toast back 
down and place his rough hand upon her&#39;s, causing her to look up from 
her food, &quot;Do you promise to keep at my side and not run off?&quot; He 
inquired sternly, there was a deep dark seriousness to those tired eyes 
that told Jennifer that this man would hold little qualms in killing her 
if he had to. There were countless children in the world and he would 
not have a hard time finding a replacement for her. 

&quot;I promise.&quot; She found herself promising a lot as of late and hoped that 
her oaths did not loss their strength if she could not keep those 
promises. 

The man nodded and smiled, &quot;Then finish your toast and we will be on our 
way. 

The sound of those words perked up Jennifer&#39;s mood and she happily 
chewed on her food as she thought about the adventures they were about 
to have. 

It took the girl little time to finish off her food and before long the 
two of them were on there way out of the house. Jennifer breathed in the 
hot air as she stepped off the patio and onto the front lawn. She 
stretched her arms against the aches that had arisen during her morning 
cleaning and smiled up at the sun. Maybe this would not be so bad after 
all. It was not as if she was living on the street with little to eat. 
Although he was no millionaire foster father with plans to sweep the 
girl into a world of adventure and mystery. She was sure he would at the 
very least feed her and gave her a warm room to sleep in. 

Excitedly she ran up to the gate and was about to open it when the man&#39;s 
voice boomed across the yard, &quot;Do not venture off to far, Joshua.&quot; 

Hesitantly she retreated her hand from the gate and turned to face the 
man, &quot;I just wanted to get the gate for you.&quot; She said, half lying. She 
was not going to run away, but she was thinking of running and playing 
for a moment.

If the man noticed the lie he made no sign of it, &quot;Just keep in eye 
sight, alright?&quot; He instructed. 

The girl nodded, then opened the gate and held it open for the man. 

&quot;Thank you, young lad.&quot; The man said playfully as he moved through the 
gate. Her happy spirits quickly fell as she noticed the butt end of the 
gun sticking out of his jacket pocket when he passed by.   

She let the gate swing closed behind her and followed nervously behind 
the man, her eyes never leaving that weapon. Any playful thoughts 
quickly evaporated as fast as they appeared with the sight of that gun. 
She told herself to not get her hopes up so quickly for she should have 
known he would have had it with him. She let her head hang low as she 
trudge along behind the man, neither speaking a word. 

&quot;Hello, Mr. Greg.&quot; A soft and quiet voice all of a sudden said. 

Jennifer stopped in her tracks just before she collided into the back of 
the man. She glanced around to find them surrounded by the many 
different roses of the rose garden that they had passed the other night. 
She moved out from behind the man to see a young girl of about her same 
age looking up at the man. The girl wore a pale blue long sleeved shirt 
under a white summer dress with cut off sleeves. Ribbons of straight, 
light blonde hair spilled out from under a large white summer&#39;s hat to 
her shoulders and shimmered in the sunlight making them appear almost 
golden. Her smile was bright and cheerful as she spoke to the man for a 
moment, greeting him a good day for all Jennifer could tell for she was 
too mesmerized by the girl.

The girl seemed to notice Jennifer watching her and turned her smile 
upon her, &quot;Why hello and good morning.&quot;

The man, whom Jennifer now figured must be Greg considering there was no 
one else about that the girl could have been addressing, placed a hand 
upon Jennifer&#39;s shoulder and coxed her forwards, &quot;This is my son, 
Joshua.&quot; He introduced the girl, &quot;Joshua, this is Wendy. She is from the 
Rose Garden Orphanage, not far from here.&quot; 

&#39;A girl from the orphanage?&#39; Jennifer&#39;s mind raced as she tried to think 
of something to say, but could not find her tongue. She simply stared at 
the girl in disbelief and wished for her month to form some kind of 
words. 

Greg smacked the back of Jennifer&#39;s head, knocking her hat over her 
eyes. Quickly she fixed her hat and glared up at the man to find her 
gaze returned doubly by the man&#39;s, &quot;Where are your manners?&quot; He stated 
angrily. 

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She turned to Wendy as she continued to adjust her 
hat, &quot;Go... good morning.&quot; She stammered nervously. 

Wendy simply smiled, &quot;It is a pleasure to meet you.&quot; She said with a 
slight curtsy. Her eyes dropped to several long stemmed roses that lay 
upon a piece of newspaper at her feet. She stooped and pick up one of 
the roses and handled it out to Jennifer, &quot;Here.&quot; She offered politely, 
&quot;For you.&quot;

Jennifer stared at the flower in confusion, then reached out to take it, 
&quot;T... Thank you...&quot; As her hand circled around the flower their fingers 
lightly touched and for an instant Jennifer felt how soft the girl&#39;s 
skin was. She felt a blush overcome her and hastily retrieved the rose, 
pulling it close to her chest. 

Greg smiled down at Jennifer, &quot;Now isn&#39;t that nice of her.&quot; He beamed 
and turned to Wendy, &quot;Try not to stay outside to late.&quot; He warned the 
girl, &quot;You should think of your health.&quot; 

Wendy gave a quick nod, &quot;I was finished here already.&quot; She stated as she 
knelt and wrapped the newspaper print around the roses, leaving the 
blossoms peeking out for all to see. She again smiled at Joshua, &quot;I hope 
to see you around.&quot; She said. 

Jennifer slowly nodded her head, &quot;Me too.&quot; 

Wendy shuffled her feet, &quot;Well, I have to get back to the orphanage or 
Mr. Hoffman will scold me.&quot; She said as she turned to head down a small 
path that ran beside the garden. She took one last glance over her 
shoulder before disappearing from sight. 

Jennifer sniffed at her rose as she walked down the road at Greg&#39;s side. 
She shook her head and reminded herself that she was indeed a girl, 
although the man insisted that she was not. The idea that she would ever 
meet Wendy again was very unlikely so she tried to push the girl out of 
her mind, but for some reason the girl&#39;s image lingered. She was so deep 
in her thoughts that she became oblivious to the sights and sounds 
around her. She didn&#39;t even seem to notice as they entered a tiny 
village and then a grocer&#39;s market.

&quot;Would you like some crayons?&quot; 

Startled Jennifer glanced around to see the man standing beside her with 
a small packet of crayons in his hand. He shook them in an attempt to 
gain draw the girl&#39;s attention to them. 

The idea of having something to draw, and writing, with pleased her and 
she smiled in acknowledgement of the offer, &quot;Yes, please.&quot;

Greg picked up a pad of paper and handed it, along with the crayons, to 
the girl, &quot;This should do you for some time.&quot; He stated with a nod. 

Jennifer joggled the pad and crayons in her arms, minding the rose so it 
did not get crushed. 

Greg smiled in amusement, &quot;It was nice of Wendy to give you that rose.&quot; 
He said with more cheer in his voice then normal, &quot;Maybe she will be 
your princess.&quot; 

Jennifer flushed brightly and stammered, &quot;N... n... no... She... she 
wouldn&#39;t...&quot; She bowed her head in shame of not being able to finish her 
sentence. There was no way a girl would like another girl in that way. 
She was no prince and she would eternally be alone. 

Greg placed a hand upon Jennifer&#39;s hat and ruffled it about, &quot;Stop 
putting yourself down. You are handsome and any girl would say so.&quot; 

&quot;What is this?&quot; A woman sorting apples turned her attention to the two 
of them, &quot;Has Joshua found a little sweet heart?&quot; She inquired, eyeing 
the rose. 

Jennifer could feel her flush deepen and felt nervous about being put on 
the spot, &quot;N... no...&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t be modest.&quot; Greg stated, &quot;A girl from Rose Garden Orphanage gave 
him that rose.&quot; 

The woman frowned slightly, &quot;Boys should be the one giving out the 
roses.&quot; She paused for a moment as she glanced around, as if to make 
sure no one in particular was listening, &quot;I would steer clear of that 
place. I hear those children are on the twisted side. Little devils they 
are.&quot; 

Greg shook his head, &quot;They are just kids being kids.&quot; He defended, &quot;I&#39;ve 
seen that little girl in the Garden several time. Always gathering roses 
for the Orphanage.&quot; 

The woman scowled at her warning being taken so lightly, &quot;Still, I would 
be careful.&quot; 

&quot;We will.&quot; Greg assured, and then dug in his pockets, &quot;How much do I own 
you?&quot; 

Jennifer&#39;s mind drifted away from the conversation and she thought about 
what had been said. Wendy did not appear to be a little devil as the 
woman suggested. She seemed too sweet and innocent to be a devil of any 
kind. She pondered over why someone would think such a child could be a 
devil as the two them left the village. She twirled the rose between her 
fingers of one hand and held a folded paper back containing her new 
writing impalements in the other.

It did not take long to return back to their home and Jennifer headed 
for her bedroom. Intending to put her things away, she stopped by the 
kitchen for a moment to find a glass and filled it with water, then 
placed the stem of the flower into the glass and carefully took it 
downstairs. 

&quot;I will be in the my study.&quot; Greg announced as he watched the girl move 
cautiously down the hall. 

&quot;Alright.&quot; She called back down the hall, and then moved down the stairs 
and into her room. 

She spotted her suitcase leaning against the walk near the door. It 
appeared that Greg had decided she could have the suitcase and she was 
grateful. She only hoped that would mean some clean undergarments to 
change into in the tomorrow. She would check in a moment, first the 
rose.

She dropped her package upon the desk, and then set the glass on a small 
shelf along the back of the desk. She backed away from the flower and 
sat down heavily upon her bed. The rose looked so bright against the 
dull drab basement walls. It brought such colour to the room that 
Jennifer could feel herself brighten ever so slightly. She hoped that 
one-day she did get to meet Wendy again. She wanted to thank her 
properly. The way a prince really should. 

Her eyes moved to the suitcase and got up from the bed to look upon its 
contents. She picked up the case and placed it on the chair then flipped 
the latches. Inside she found all her dresses and other clothes. A smile 
played across her face as she pulled a pale yellow dress from the case 
and held it out before her. She so wanted to wear a dress instead of 
these boy&#39;s clothes, but decided not to try even for a moment. The man 
may get angry and destroy the rest of them just as he did her other 
dress. 

Thinking about that exact dress she remember that she had placed it in 
the corner. She picked it up and frowned at the tear. Maybe someone 
would be able to fix it after all. With a hope in her heart she placed 
the dress with the others and pushed the case under her bed. Just as she 
turned around she saw Greg standing at the doorway and she jumped in 
fright. 

He slowly entered the room and handed her a small set of papers tied 
together with bits of string. 

&quot;I thought you might be interested in my newest story.&quot; He stated, his 
hand out stretched, awaiting the girl to take the pages. 

Hesitantly, she took them and stared down at the front page, on which 
was a drawing of what appeared a bunch of stick figures standing around 
a coffin and the words &quot;The Funeral&quot; declared the title of the story. 

The man backed out of the room again, &quot;I hope you like the story. Get 
some rest.&quot; He closed the door behind him and locked it, &quot;Good night, 
Joshua.&quot; 

Jennifer stared in bewilderment at the pages before her. There were only 
ten or more pages and from a quick flip of the pages she could tell that 
a few of them were blank. Curiously she turned to the first page to read 
the story within. 

Page one showed a childish drawing of two little girls standing side by 
side. The drawing made her think that a child was the artist and not a 
grown man, but still she flipped to the next page.

Page two featured the first bit of story. The man&#39;s printing was sketchy 
and somewhat hard to read, but Jennifer found she managed. The story 
read as follows, &quot;Once upon a time, a girl found a hole in the ground in 
the yard.&quot; The opposite page had a black oval drawn on it and nothing 
more.

She turned to the next page and continued to read, &quot;The little people 
came and told her the news.&quot; This time the adjacent page showed little 
stick figures crawling out of the hole. They had round heads and large 
black eyes. The image sent shiver go through Jennifer&#39;s spine and she 
quickly moved to the following page.

&quot;Today is the day of your funeral. If you don&#39;t like it, then you must 
sacrifice your friend.&quot; This page featured a picture of a shovel in the 
ground. 

Jennifer trembled as fear of the outcome of this tale traced through her 
body, but felt compelled continue on. Grasping at the tiny hope that 
this story ended well. &quot;Who wants to be buried alive?&quot; It read a drawing 
of a little girl at the bottom of a hole accompanied these words causing 
a foreboding felling to fill her stomach.

The next page held a drawing of a bag at the bottom of the hole and 
Jennifer could feel a lump forming in her throat, &quot;So the girl did what 
she had to, and buried her best friend.&quot; 

Shakily she turned the page once more, &quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t want to be her 
best friend!&quot; This last page showed a sketch of a mound of dirt and 
something like a grave marker sticking out of it.

She turned to the next page and the one after to find them all blank. 
She turned the book over in her hands and swallowed hard. There would be 
very little sleep for Jennifer that night.
