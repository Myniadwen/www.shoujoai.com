<h1>Secret Letters from the Rose Garden (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rulerose/index.html">Rule of the Rose</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../rulerose/secretletter-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Jennifer was awoken by the door hitting her in the back as the man 
entered. He pushed the door open enough for he to peek his head inside 
and glowered down at her, &quot;Why are you not in your nightshirt?&quot; He 
inquired with a disapproving look upon his face. 

The girl scrambled backwards until she backed herself into a corner and 
trembled as the man entered the room. He set a neatly folded set of 
clothing upon a chair and a pair of shoes beside it, then turned to look 
upon the girl once again and frowned at her. 

&quot;Why don&#39;t you take off your coat?&quot; He stated angrily, &quot;It isn&#39;t polite 
to wear a your coat indoors. I gave you a wardrobe for a reason.&quot; He 
moved quickly to her and took hold of her by the coat.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She sobbed as he began to unbutton the jacket for her.  

&quot;Sometime I do not understand you bo-&quot; He stopped as he opened the coat 
and stared at the girl&#39;s blue dress. His nostrils flared and his eyes 
filled with hostility as he glared at the girl, &quot;How many times have I 
told you that boys don&#39;t wear dresses?!?&quot; He exclaimed, taking hold of 
the front of her coat and pulling her to her feet.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry!!&quot; She cried out as she raised her hand in front of herself 
in defence, afraid that the man may strike her. 

&quot;Stop crying Joshua!&quot; He demanded, slapping the girl across the face, 
&quot;You&#39;re almost a man so start acting like one.&quot; He grabbed hold of the 
front of her dress and pulled down, tearing it open from the collar to 
her waist; &quot;I want you out of these filthy clothes and changed into your 
proper clothes this minute.&quot; To enforce his command he tossed the girl 
to the ground like a discarded rag doll. 

Jennifer let out a cry of pain as she collided with the wall and cowered 
in the corner, clenching her arms protectively around her body, &quot;I... 
I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She sobbed, unable to stop the tears from 
flowing. 

&quot;Stop trying to act like a girl, because it will not get you out of your 
work. It didn&#39;t work when you pretended to be ill and this will not work 
either. Now get dressed while I find some scissors to cut that hair of 
yours.&quot; He pointed to the clothes he had just set on the chair, and then 
turned to leave the room, locking the door behind him. 

Jennifer glanced upon the tear in her clothes. It was torn beyond repair 
and even though she knew she had some sewing skills she knew that there 
was no way to restore the dress to its former beauty. She stared at the 
door with uncertainty as she wiped at her tears, wincing at the pain in 
her left cheek from where the man had struck her. She kept her eyes on 
the door, unsure if the man would return to extract he anger upon her 
once again. When she heard his heavy boots mount the stairs she allowed 
herself to breath once again and permitted herself a quick scan of her 
new bedroom. 

The light of new day shone through a small rectangular window place 
close to the ceiling, but even the sight of the sun did not brighten her 
mood like it used to. The room was small and held a tiny bed against the 
far wall under the window. Upon the bed a nightshirt had been spread out 
for her. A small chair was near the foot of the bed, with her new 
clothes patiently awaiting the girl to put them on. A large wardrobe 
took up the far corner, opposite where she now sat and a small desk was 
place kitty-cornered to the wardrobe. 

She let out a sign of defeat and gazed at the clothes upon the chair. 
Shakily she crawled towards them and pulled them off the chair to 
discover that they consisted of a white short-sleeved shirt, a pair of 
brown shorts and some suspenders, all boys&#39; clothes as far as Jennifer 
was concerned. She stared at the clothes in confusion when she heard the 
sounds of the man&#39;s feet overhead and quickly disrobed. She did not want 
to suffered at the hands of the man again so decided it would be best to 
play along for the time being. 

Slowly she stripped off her jacket and opened the wardrobe. It was old 
and made of a greying wood. The hinges were rusting and barely holding 
to the wood, causing one of the doors to hang slightly lopsided and 
Jennifer had to be careful not to tear it from its placement when 
opening it. Something fell as she opened one of the more secure looking 
doors, hitting the girl upon the head and startling a small yelp from 
her lips. She leapt backwards slightly in fear that it was one of the 
creatures she remembered seeing under the patio the other night. 

On the ground, partly under the foot of the bed, she found a stuffed 
bear. She knelt to pick up the toy and examined it closely. It was faded 
and old, one of its button eyes were dangling from a string and there 
was a rip in one of its legs that was bleeding yellowing fluff. To the 
girl the bear looked as depressing and sad as she felt. She proceeded to 
brush the dirt off the back of the bear and smiled down at it. Something 
about the bear made her feel slightly better about her situation, not so 
alone. She gave the bear a light hug and set upon the bed with its back 
to the wall, before she turned back to the wardrobe. 

She pulled down one of the few coat hangers that dangled from a rod that 
stretched across the inside of the wardrobe and prepared to hang her 
jacket up. Something about this action felt final to her. As if by doing 
so she was abandoning all hope of escaping that house. She hesitated for 
a moment, glancing around the room once again. There was no way she 
could escape the house and she was sure that the man would not allow her 
out of his sight as long as he was around. With a sigh she gave in to 
defeat and placed the coat upon the rack and closed the wardrobes doors. 

She leaned against the wardrobe as she tried to will her body to move. 
She wanted to curl up right then and there, however she knew if the man 
returned his anger would be much worse then before. She did not want to 
suffer at the hands of that man so decided it would be best to get 
dressed, anything would be better then going around in torn clothes. 
With a few silent sobs over lose of her dress, she removed the mangled 
remains of the clothes and placed them upon the bed, followed closely by 
her Mary Jane shoes, which she set under the bed, and her stockings. She 
kept on her bloomers and undershirt; even if the man had given her a new 
pair she was uncertain she wanted to wear boy&#39;s undergarments. 

Slowly, she pulled on the short, then the shirt and fastened the 
suspenders to a set of buttons along the top of the short. She had to 
will her hands to stop shaking as she fastened the last of the shirt&#39;s 
buttons, then pulled the suspenders over her arms and adjusted them. 
Finally she picked up the shoes and found a pair of long socks tucked in 
each shoe. She pulled on one sock, with some effort, then the other. The 
shoes themselves were slightly big on her feet, but not too bad. As she 
tied her shoes she heard the locks on the door rattle and she quickly 
finished tying the second shoe then moved back into the corner of the 
room, with her back against the wall and her hands behind her back. 

The man came through the door with a pair of rather rusty looking 
scissors in his hands. A smile played across his face at the sight of 
the girl fully dressed, &quot;That&#39;s a good boy, Joshua. Now let&#39;s see to 
that hair of yours.&quot; He beaconed for Jennifer to come forward as he 
pulled the chair into the middle of the room. 

Too terrified to refuse the man&#39;s orders she guardedly moved across the 
room and sat down upon the chair. The man took a lock of the girl&#39;s long 
dirty blonde hair and with a snip it dropped to the floor. Jennifer bit 
down upon her lower lip as she stifled back a yelp of pain as the 
scissors more tore at her hair then cut it. She sobbed slightly as she 
watched locks of her hair tumble to the ground about her feet. Her 
beautiful hair, she had enjoyed having long hair and even wanted to grow 
it out longer, but now that looked like it would be impossibility. 

&quot;I can not understand how we allowed your hair to get this long.&quot; The 
man stated bewilderedly, &quot;Joshua, you have to learn to take better care 
of yourself or you will never find your princess.&quot; 

The man heedfully cut away at the girl&#39;s hair, being careful as he moved 
around her small ears and along her bangs. When he was finished he 
stepped in front of the girl and grinned at his achievement. 

&quot;That&#39;s much better.&quot; The man said proudly and then fetches a folded hat 
from his back pocket, one that matched his own, and set it upon the 
girl&#39;s head, &quot;Now you look more like my son.&quot; He stated satisfactorily, 
&quot;Now come upstairs and clean yourself up before having some breakfast.&quot; 
The man gestured to the door. 

Jennifer grudgingly got up from the chair, rubbing at her tear-streaked 
face and shaking the loose hairs from her shoulders. Dismally she moved 
through the door with the man closely beside her, dragging her feet in 
her wake. 

She felt his hand upon her shoulder as he guided the girl up the stairs 
and out the door at the top. As she left the basement for the hall she 
noticed the back door once again and peered outside. The morning&#39;s sun 
peeked over the trees and spread its light across the back yard. She 
could see two distinct mounds of dirt in the middle of the yard with a 
shovel sticking out of the closer mass. She stared at these small hills, 
wondering what the man could have been burying out there when her eyes 
fell upon what appeared to be a child&#39;s shoe. She staggered away from 
the door as the thought of another little girl lying under that moist 
earth invaded her mind. She placed a hand to her mouth and tried to not 
let out the scream that wanted to break free. 

The man glanced out the window and followed the girl&#39;s gaze, &quot;Do you 
want to help me plant peas today?&quot; The man inquired. 

Jennifer backed away from the door and gazed up at the man as he stood 
over him. She was not sure if the man was being serious. Was it really 
peas that he buried out in the garden? Then her mind recalled that 
dreadful poem and she swallowed hard. Could there have been more 
children before her? Other kids forced to play the role of this man&#39;s 
son? What happened to his son? Was one of the mounds out there a grave 
for him and another unfortunate child? Before she realized what she was 
doing she felt herself slowly nodded her head in agreement with planting 
peas. 

A smile drew across the man&#39;s face and he patted the girl upon the back, 
causing her to stumble towards the back door and she quickly backed away 
again, &quot;That&#39;s a good boy. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re feeling better. Why don&#39;t you 
get cleaned up first and we&#39;ll have breakfast together?&quot; He insisted, 
beaming at the girl. 

Jennifer forced herself to smile at the man and nodded again. She turned 
around to face the intersection. She recalled spotting the washroom down 
the hall to the left and ventured in that direction. When she reached 
the door, that she suspected would be the washroom, she glanced back 
down the hall to see the man had gone the opposite direction. There were 
doors to either side of the hall and a window at the far end.

She curiously watched the man for a moment. His movements seemed rather 
slow and he was hunched over most of the time. He still wore the same 
old grungy work coat and hat that Jennifer thought could use a good 
washing. The man entered the room to the right and disappeared from 
sight, closing the door behind him. She gazed down at the round metal 
handle of the door before her. Her mind racing over her current 
situation, Was she to be this man&#39;s slave and do chores all her life or 
did he want something more from her? 

She shuttered at the thought and again glanced around herself. She was 
alone in the hall and the sense to flee entered her mind. She wondered 
if she could make it to the front door without the man being aware, if 
so would it be open?  And should she risk an attempt to escape? What if 
the door was locked and the man found her trying to escape? Would he 
hurt her more or would he just lock her in the basement again? More over 
still, what if he had his gun with him and shot her down as she ran down 
the path away from his house? She had no idea where she was or how to 
get back to the city. She could try to get to that orphanage, but what 
if the man caught up to her? He would surely do harm to her if he did 
catch her. She lightly touched her cheek and quickly tossed the idea of 
escape out of her mind, then turned the knob of the door. 

Inside she found a square room with a tub to one end and a toilet beside 
it. At the sight of the toilet she recalled that she had been holding it 
in for a while and really needed to go. Locking the door behind her she 
quickly rushed over to the toilet and stopped. It was a mess and looked 
as if it had not been cleaning in some time. Really needing to go she 
swallowed her pride and pulled down her pants.

When she was finished she moved to an oval sink that stood before a 
round mirror, that to looked like it had not seen a cleaning aside from 
the arm of a sleeve. She approached the mirror and her eyes fell upon 
her reflection in horror. With her new haircut she really did look like 
a little boy now and the sight of this made her cry. She held onto the 
sides of the sink as tears tumbled down her cheeks into the drain. She 
tried hard to keep her sobs quiet, but felt so lost at that moment that 
she did not think she could hold them back. 

She grabbed hold of one of the facets and turned it, with some 
struggling. Soon murky water splashed at the bottom of the sink, 
spiralling down the drain. It mixed with the layer of grim that clung to 
the sides of the sink, turning the water a dark brown. She cupped her 
hands and allowed the water to fill them. It was cold and soaked through 
her bandages. She could feel her fingers numb almost instantly, but did 
not withdraw them until they were overflowing with the liquid. Shakily, 
she splashed the water over her face and through her hair, knocking her 
hat to the ground. Still feeling the tears flowing she took another 
handful of water and hit herself in the face yet again. She leaned over 
the sink, panting as she tried to regain control of her emotions. Her 
bangs dripping with water as she stared at the dull liquid, circling 
about the sink and slowly disappearing down the drain. 

&quot;Joshua, are you alright?&quot; The man&#39;s voice drifted through the door. 

The girl spun around to face the door, her eyes fast upon the doorknob. 
She waited for a moment, holding her breath, unsure if she had actually 
locked it. 

&quot;Joshua?&quot; 

&quot;I... I&#39;m f... fine...&quot; She stated, turning off the tap and picked up 
the hat off the floor, &quot;T... the water&#39;s cold.&quot; She stated, watching the 
last of the liquid disappear down the drain. 

&quot;I can heat some water if you want a bath.&quot; 

At first that sounded like a great idea, then Jennifer&#39;s eyes fell upon 
the tub. There was a layer of grim along the top that looked to be 
inches thick. She crept closer to the tub to see a ring of deep crimson 
near the bottom and she reconsidered. 

&quot;Joshua?&quot; 

The girl rushed over to the door and opened it. 

The man blinked down at the girl in confusion, &quot;Is there something 
wrong?&quot; 

The girl shook her head and glanced back at the washroom for a moment, 
&quot;C... can I clean the washroom instead of helping with peas?&quot; She 
inquired nervously, really not wanting to poke around in that garden for 
fear of what she might find out there. 

The man smiled down at the girl, &quot;Sure you can.&quot; He agreed, &quot;But first 
let&#39;s have something to eat.&quot; He gestured to another door to the left, 
where the hall elbowed to the right. 

Jennifer moved towards the door and opened it. This room served as both 
kitchen and dinning room. Immediately in front of the girl stood a small 
square table with only two wooden chairs to either side. To her left was 
a counter ran in an &quot;L&quot; shape along the far wall. A small stove and 
fridge took up the far end of the counter and there was a sink under a 
small window in the middle of the counter. 

The man circled around Jennifer as he entered the kitchen and opened the 
fridge, &quot;Would you get me a frying pan from the sink?&quot; He inquired as he 
dug in the fridge for something to eat. 

Jennifer crossed the room to the sink and grimaced at the mess before 
her. Pots and pans overflowed the sink and across the counter top. She 
was not sure if there was a frying pan under the mound of dishes. 
Deciding to make the best of her situation she began to sort the pile 
and clear out the sink. She found a clean pot under in a cupboard under 
the sink and filled it with water, then placed it on the stove. She 
turned on the stove and searched for the matches. Under a plate she 
found a large box of matches and took out one match, then struck it and 
placed it under the pot, blue flames burst forth before her eyes. For a 
moment Jennifer found herself mesmerized by the glow of the flames. 
Images of the bloody corpses from her nightmares jumped to mind and she 
needed to force them out of her mind. When she glanced around she found 
the man standing beside her with a puzzled look upon his face and a 
basket of eggs in his hand. 

&quot;What are you doing Joshua?&quot; He asked curiously. 

&quot;W... warming some wa...water to wash the dishes.&quot; She said shyly, 
pointing to mound on the counter. 

The man glanced around the room and as if for the first time he noticed 
the piles of dishes, &quot;I guess it is getting a bit messy around here.&quot; He 
stated sheepishly. 

Jennifer reached out for the egg basket, &quot;I&#39;ll make breakfast.&quot; She 
insisted, taking the basket from his hands and finding a clear spot on 
the counter to set them. 

The man settled into a chair at the table and watched the girl in 
amusement, &quot;I am so glad to see you are well again.&quot; He stated as he 
took his hat off and rubbed the back of his neck, &quot;I was so worried 
about you before, but I see you are doing so much better now.&quot; He pulled 
the gun out from the back of his waistband and set it upon the table. 

Jennifer paused for a moment as she considered her actions as she stared 
at the weapon. The man thought that she was his son, but did his son do 
dishes and clean? She did not know and hoped that by doing these things 
that maybe she would not upset him. Seeing that he was not pointing the 
gun at her she decided to continue as she was and just hope it was the 
right thing.

&quot;I... I&#39;m feeling much better thanks.&quot; She stated, nervously playing 
along. 

The man bowed his head; &quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t go outside at night 
anymore. You might catch a cold again and I don&#39;t want you sick again.&quot; 

The man seemed so miserable and weak at that moment that it made 
Jennifer feel sorry for him. &quot;I... I promise...&quot; She said softly, unsure 
if they were the right words to say. 

The man looked up at the girl and she watched as a tear trace a clean 
streak through the dirt upon his face, &quot;Thank you Joshua. You are 
everything to me.&quot; He let out a shutter as if he were fighting with a 
wave of depression and suddenly got to his feet, &quot;I&#39;ll wait in the den. 
Call me when breakfast is ready.&quot; He said as he picked up the gun and 
roamed out of the room, his head low and the gun swinging loosely at his 
side. 

Jennifer almost felt sorry for the man and considered going after him, 
but reconsidered. Whatever was bothering the man would not be something 
that a child could help with, however she could make life easier for the 
man and it was not like she had any place important to go. Seeing that 
the water was boiling she rushed over to it and prepared to begin her 
new life in her new home.
