<h1>Secret Letters from the Rose Garden (part 4 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rulerose/index.html">Rule of the Rose</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../rulerose/secretletter-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Over the next month Jennifer became more accustom to her new home, well 
as best one can with considering the circumstances. She did as she was 
told and played along with being the man&#39;s son. He gave her more 
stories, each one creepier then the next, and she wondered if he was 
trying to tell her something. She told him that she liked his stories; 
for fear that he might react badly if she told the truth. Each story was 
making her feel even more ill at ease and wanting nothing more then to 
escape this nightmare of a place. Every time she told the man she liked 
the story he would go off happily to write another story for her. He 
spent a lot of time in his study and allowed her to go about her chores 
undisturbed. 

It appeared that as long as she continued along with his game she was 
refrained from being struck like that first night. Dread still boiled 
away inside of her little heart every time she saw that gun or those 
mounds of dirt in the back. She did not wish to end up like the real 
Joshua so kept to her chores in hopes that Greg would not be upset and 
&quot;grind her up&quot; as he promised in his poem. 

Before long summer started to turn into autumn as the cool north wind 
began to blow in, making her room ever so much colder with ever passing 
day. Her rose had quickly died, but she refused to take it from her room 
and allowed the flower to dry up in the glass where it sat. The petals 
turned black and fell to the desk one after another, but still she 
refused to remove it. She wished she could nurse the flower back to 
life, but felt it was in the same state as her own withering feelings of 
hope. She watched the rose in the middle of the night as she curled up 
with the thin blankets wrapped around herself, wishing to herself for 
something to free her from this place.

During her chores she came across a room that was completely empty aside 
from a few boxes. Each box was marked with large letters spelling out 
the name &quot;JOSHUA&quot; and she reflected on if this used to be the boy&#39;s 
room. There was no sign of furniture or anything else for that matter, 
other then the boxes. She considered peeking inside and reconsidered, 
quickly leaving the room and her curiosity behind her, allowing the dust 
bunnies to keep their accommodations for the time being. 

The door next to this one was even more of a curiosity then the first. 
This one was boarded shut with many planks of wood, as if someone were 
trying to keep something locked behind the walls. She stared at the door 
for a time and suddenly realized that she had not seen the room the man 
slept within. He always made sure to lock Jennifer inside of her room 
before going off to bed himself, so this was the first time she 
actualized that he had no bedroom. She had searched the entire house by 
now and had counted only two bedrooms; if the room behind the boarded up 
door was just that; there was also the study, the kitchen, washroom and 
living room. Other then that she did not recall seeing another bed 
amongst the furniture. 

The living room, which took up the centre of the house, with north and 
south doors that opened up onto the &quot;C&quot; shaped hall, was small. There 
was a single couch the sat in the middle of the room with a long coffee 
table before it. A large fireplace took up the far wall and Jennifer 
wanted nothing more then to sit before the fire with a cup of warm coca 
in her hands. 

The first day she had entered this room she discovered loose newspapers 
were scattered about the room. It was such a cluttered mess that it made 
it hard to see the very floor beneath her feet. As she picked up some 
newspapers, folding them nicely and placing them upon the coffee table, 
she puzzled over where the man would sleep. If he used the couch it must 
have been rather uncomfortable. A few springs broke through what she 
supposed used to be velvet upholstery, upholstery that had now faded to 
a point that no longer resembled anything like velvet. She was not even 
sure that the man had any clothes other then the ones he wore. She 
thought this would be preposterous and laughed at the thought, grabbing 
another paper from the ground. Her laughter was cut short when she 
noticed one of the pages of newspaper and the article written upon it. 

&quot;Luxury Airship Missing!&quot; It read in bold lettering across the front 
page, &quot;England&#39;s largest luxury airship, which just set out on its 
virgin flight - a flight celebrated across the country with great 
fanfare - was reported today to have gone off course and is currently 
missing. It is speculated that the vessel diverted from its course to 
avoid a low-pressure system approaching from the south, but its 
whereabouts are still unknown. 

Due to the heavy thunder and rain that have blanketed the area since 
yesterday, the search for the airship has faced many difficulties.&quot; 

The date on the page, June 23rd 1929, verified to her that it was indeed 
the same airship that she escaped not that long ago. Her hand had only 
just healed and seeing the newspaper made it tingle ever so slightly. 
She trembled at the sight of the picture above the article. It was a 
shot of the airship taking off and many people throwing confetti into 
the air. Who would have thought that only a month after that day she 
would end up a captive in a strange house with a man who insisted she 
was a boy. 

She wiped at her eyes with the back of her hand and knelt to continue 
collecting the papers, trying to get her mind off the past. Then yet 
another headline caught her attention, &quot;Another Unexplained 
Disappearance.&quot; The title screamed out from its page. Under the headline 
was a pair of photos of two young kids, one of a girl and one of a boy. 
Both were about her age and looked very much alike. She quickly scanned 
the article and could feel her blood freeze in her veins.  

&quot;There has been another mysterious disappearance of a child recently.
Following missing children reports on the 7th and 14th, police are now 
investigating this case as both a possible kidnapping and missing 
person. 
Local residents are advised not to allow children outside unsupervised 
and to take caution around any suspicious individuals.&quot; 

Her mind turned yet again to the two mounds outside and she felt a 
shutter wash over her. Her eyes spotted the date of the paper, June 21st 
1929, only days before the airship crash. Could she really be right 
about those masses out back? Did he really kill two kids in the month 
before she met him? This thought did not bode well in the girl&#39;s mind. 
In the past weeks she had convinced herself that no children were buried 
in the back yard and now, faced with this newspaper, she had to face the 
reality that this man could, and might, kill her at any given moment.
