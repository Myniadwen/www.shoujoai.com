<h1>Secret Letters from the Rose Garden (part 8 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rulerose/index.html">Rule of the Rose</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../rulerose/secretletter-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Jennifer slept restlessly that night. Her mind filled with images of 
that man doing harm to her Princess. She had no idea what Wendy had 
planned, but hoped that the girl would not confront the man head on. 
Wendy was such an innocent soul and Greg would have an easy time 
extinguishing her life. This thought tortured Jennifer&#39;s soul through 
out the long hours of the night, chasing away any attempt of sleep.

The next day Jennifer found herself groggy and weak. She could barely 
get to her feet to prepare food for breakfast, but forced herself to 
move. As usual Greg unlocked the door bright and early. He stared down 
at the bags under the girl&#39;s eyes worriedly.
 
&quot;Are you alright Joshua?&quot; He inquired, knelling to her height to get a 
better look in her eyes and placing one of his dirt covered hands upon 
her forehead. 

The feeling made Jennifer have to force back a cringe. His hand were 
rough and she hated the feeling of him touching her, even if he only did 
it when she was ill, &quot;I... I&#39;m fine...&quot; She forced herself to smile and 
shook some of the sleep from her head, &quot;I just need to wash my face.&quot; 
She stated simply, hoping the man would believe her. 

Greg stood, keeping his eyes upon the girl, &quot;Alright, You be quick about 
it.&quot; He stated, &quot;I have to go to the market today so you&#39;ll have to stay 
in your room. It is too cold for you to go outside.&quot; He reminded the 
girl. 

Jennifer let out a sign of regret, and then smiled up at the man, &quot;I&#39;ll 
be alright.&quot; Now she was trying to convince herself more then anything 
else. 

&quot;Alright then.&quot; With that he turned around and left the room, &quot;I&#39;ll see 
you in the kitchen then.&quot; 

Jennifer took one quick look at the window, almost expecting to see 
Wendy&#39;s grinning face staring down at her. When she did not see the 
girl&#39;s smile Jennifer head out of the room and to the washroom. 

Cleaning her face did wash away some of the sleep from her mind, however 
it did not take away the anxiety of the day&#39;s ahead. Would Wendy really 
come to her rescue? Would she really be free of this place? She did not 
want to get her hopes up, but her mind kept turning back to those 
letters and she prayed that her Princess was not lying. 

She quickly cooks up some breakfast and ate in silence, her eyes darting 
to the kitchen window every now and then. She kept thinking that she saw 
Wendy dart by every now and then, but displaced the idea and went back 
to eating her eggs. Before long the man ushered her back to her room and 
locked the door shut. 

Jennifer lay upon her bed, anxiously awaiting Wendy&#39;s arrival. After an 
hour of no sign of her princess she pulled her suitcase out from under 
her bed and opened it. Atop of her clothes where the many letters that 
the two girls had exchanged over the past few months. Jennifer picked up 
the last letter and smiled at it.  

&quot;Everlasting true love,&quot; She spoke aloud, &quot;I am yours.&quot; A flush crossed 
her cheeks at those words and her heart began to pound out of control. 
Did Wendy really mean those words? She truly hoped so. She hugged the 
letters to her chest as a tear brimmed in the corner of her eye, &quot;Oh, 
Wendy... please be safe.&quot; 
		
Suddenly there was a tap at the window and Jennifer glanced up to see 
Wendy&#39;s face beaming at her. Jennifer rushed to the window and opened 
it. 

&quot;I came, just like I promised. It looks like he went somewhere.&quot; Wendy 
stated hastily, &quot;Stay right there. I&#39;ll help you out.&quot; She pointed to 
the left, then abruptly stood and moved away from the window. 

&quot;Wendy?&quot; Jennifer stared at the girl in confusion. There was only a wall 
to her left, what was Wendy trying to tell her? Jennifer stood on her 
tiptoes to get a good look out the window. She could see Wendy as she 
ran across the back yard to Greg&#39;s shovel. The little girl pulled the 
shovel free of the dirt and swung it around until the blade end was 
facing the house. 

Jennifer glanced around to see what her Princess was aiming at. Then she 
remembered, the back door was to the left of her room and it had glass 
windows. Just as Jennifer came to this realization Wendy charged at the 
house. With a loud crash the shovel smashed through the window, sending 
shards of glass to come tumbling to the floorboards overhead.  

Jennifer jumped down from her bed as she apprehensively awaiting Wendy 
unlocking her bedroom door. Could this really be happening? Could she 
really be free of this place? She tried to not allow her excitement to 
get the better of her as she placed the letters into the suitcase and 
shut it. Just as she did so she heard the familiar click of the lock on 
her door. 

&quot;Jennifer, I unlocked the door.&quot; Wendy&#39;s voice stated from behind the 
door, &quot;I&#39;ll keep a lookout, so come right away.&quot; Before Jennifer could 
reply she heard the girl&#39;s footfalls upon the stairs and above her. 

Quickly, Jennifer picked up her suitcase and started for the door then 
stopped. She turned to look upon the stuffed bear that she had found the 
first day she had arrived in this nightmarish house. Not wanting to 
leave the bear with the man she scooped it up and placed it under her 
arm, then cautiously headed out of the room. 

Jennifer discovered glass all over the hallway floor and she carefully 
crept around it. Wendy was waiting for her at the intersection and as 
Jennifer approached the girl softly spoke. 

&quot;Let&#39;s run away before the man comes back.&quot; She stated excitedly, 
&quot;Before we go, we should find that dangerous thing and take it with us. 
It&#39;s for his own good.&quot;

&quot;But he could be back at any moment.&quot; Jennifer said worriedly, &quot;I don&#39;t 
want him to catch you.&quot; 

Wendy gave Jennifer a quick kiss on the cheek, &quot;As long as I have my 
Prince I will be alright.&quot; She took Jennifer&#39;s hand and started pulling 
her towards the study, &quot;Come on, we have to hurry.&quot; 

&quot;Wait!!! Wendy!&quot; Jennifer tried to protest, however the girl did not 
seem to hear as she opened the study door.

The moment Wendy entered the room she let go of Jennifer&#39;s hand and 
rushed over to the desk, &quot;I know he keeps it here.&quot; She stated as she 
frantically opened the draws. 

Jennifer watched the girl curiously, &quot;How do you know that?&quot; She 
inquired uneasily, her eyes moved to the window to see Greg pass by. 
Quickly she ducked away from the window to where Wendy stood, &quot;Wendy!?! 
He&#39;s here!!&quot; She quietly exclaimed as she tugged upon the girl&#39;s sleeve. 

Wendy pulled out something from a draw covered in a red cloth. Instantly 
Jennifer could tell it was the deadly devise that the man usually 
carried with him. She never thought that the man ever let it out of his 
sight, but there it was in front of her. &quot;I&#39;m fine now.&quot; Wendy said as 
she put the gun into her pocket and took Jennifer by the hand, &quot;Let us 
go, shall we?&quot;

As the two girls exited the study the could hear the heavy sound of 
Greg&#39;s boots upon the glass at the back door, &quot;He is here.&quot; Jennifer 
whispered frightfully. 

&quot;Joshua!?!&quot; The man called out, &quot;Joshua???&quot; They could hear his voice 
drift away and the echo of his boots on the stairs to the basement. 

&quot;He must have gone to check on you.&quot; Wendy explained as she glanced 
around the hall, &quot;Is there another way out of here?&quot; She inquired 
nervously. 

Jennifer pointed at the door across the hall, &quot;There is a door at the 
other side of the living room.&quot; She stated. 

Wendy squeezed Jennifer&#39;s hand, &quot;We are almost out of here.&quot; She stated 
with a smile, &quot;Come on.&quot; Without awaiting a response Wendy darted across 
the hall and into the living room, closing the door behind Jennifer. 

Across the way they spotted the door on the opposite side of the room 
and Jennifer shakily pointed at it, &quot;The front door is beyond that 
door.&quot; She stated. 

&quot;Then let us get out of here then, shall we?&quot; Wendy broke for the door, 
pulling Jennifer along with her. Double quick she opened the door and 
before them was the front door, just as Jennifer has stated. Without a 
second thought the two girls rushed for the door and slammed into it. 

&quot;It&#39;s locked!!&quot; Wendy exclaimed in confusion. 

&quot;Joshua!!&quot; Greg&#39;s voice drifted down the hall to their left and they 
could hear his boots clomping towards them. 

Wendy finally found the bolt and flipped it, &quot;We are free.&quot; She stated 
happily and threw open the door. The girl hurried across the patio and 
leaped down the stairs. Neither of them turning back as they sprinted 
across the front lawn and through the fence gate. When they reached the 
Rose Garden Wendy pulled Jennifer into the maze of bushes and to the 
back of the garden where she ducked down. 

&quot;Get down!&quot; Wendy commanded. 

Jennifer did the same and followed Wendy as they crawled through a space 
in the bushes. A few of the thorns bit at Jennifer&#39;s flesh, but she 
didn&#39;t mind for she was finally free and with her princess. Finally they 
came to a stop and sat upon the damp ground. 

&quot;I think we lost him.&quot; Wendy said with a giggle. 

Jennifer clenched at her chest as she tried to regain her breath, &quot;I... 
I was so scared... he...  was going to catch us.&quot; She said between 
pants. 

Wendy simply smiled, &quot;You did not trust me?&quot; She asked with a cock of 
her head. 

Jennifer shook her head in disagreement, &quot;I trust you always, my 
princess.&quot; 

Wendy rested her head upon Jennifer&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I&#39;m so glad... Now, we 
can always be together!&quot; 

Jennifer&#39;s heart pounded wildly and she clenched Wendy&#39;s hand in her 
own. Slowly she turned to face the girl and stared into her eyes, &quot;I 
will serve you my Princess.&quot; She stated as she allowed her forehead to 
lightly touch Wendy&#39;s, never letting her eyes break from the girls. 
Slowly moved closer until their noses touched and they softly kisses. A 
sweet innocent kiss of young love. 

Jennifer felt a heat rush through her body and backed away, &quot;I... I&#39;m 
sorry...&quot; She apologized and she glanced around nervously. 

Wendy also flushed and shook her head, &quot;No... it is alright.&quot; She said 
with a smile, &quot;As long as it is my prince.&quot; Her eyes fell to the bear 
under Jennifer&#39;s arms, &quot;Say, I have a favour I want to ask. Will you 
trade your teddy bear with my broach?&quot; She took off a red oval broach 
from the collar of her dress and handed it out to Jennifer. The broach 
held a carving of several bright red roses borderer by a brass frame. 

Jennifer was slightly startled by this request, but handed the bear 
over, &quot;Sure... If you like.&quot;

Wendy took the bear gratefully and placed the broach in Jennifer&#39;s hand. 
&quot;Hee hee... I&#39;m so happy!&quot; She exclaimed as she held the bear out at 
arms length, &quot;We should give him a name.&quot; She thought for a moment then 
a broad smile appeared on the girl&#39;s face, &quot;How about... Joshua? 
Joshua... Yes, that&#39;s a wonderful name. I&#39;ll cherish him as much as I 
cherish you. So let&#39;s renew our pact.&quot; 

They took each other&#39;s hands and spoke in unison, &quot; Everlasting true 
love. I am yours.&quot; 

Wendy giggled and stood, &quot;Come on, I want you to meet my friends at the 
Orphanage.&quot; 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Jennifer followed the girl as she headed towards the Rose Garden 
Orphanage. Anything would be better then that man&#39;s place. Or so 
Jennifer thought. 

And so yet another chapter to this poor unlucky girl&#39;s life begins.
The end...?
