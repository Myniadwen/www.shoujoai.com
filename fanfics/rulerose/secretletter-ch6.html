<h2>a <a href="../rulerose/index.html">Rule of the Rose</a>

<a href="../rulerose/secretletter-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>It was nearly a week before Wendy appeared yet again at Jennifer&#39;s 
window, six long, painful days of worry and fretting. For a young mind 
six day was an eternity of waiting. She had never felt so impatient 
before, not even Christmas made her feel this antsy. And on more then 
one occasion Jennifer considered tossing her letter out and starting 
over again. Each time she stopped herself just before tearing it in 
half, convincing herself that Wendy would understand her issues and 
return to her. 

Jennifer went about her chores with increased pace for the next few 
days, wanting to make sure she was at the window when Wendy returned. 
Each day felt like more of a disappointment then the last. Then, just as 
Jennifer was about to give up on Wendy, there came a strange scraping at 
her window, which was followed by a rapping. Excitedly, Jennifer 
snatched up her letter from its place under the mattress and jumped onto 
the bed. Snow had built up upon the ground so much that her entire 
window was buried from sight. Wendy was slowly digging away at the snow 
around the window, however Jenn could not wait for all to be cleared 
away and opened the window, causing clumps of fresh snow from around the 
window upon her bed. Unconcerned with the snow, Jennifer reached her 
tiny fingers through the gap to have Wendy grasp them lightly. Her heart 
raced at the feeling of those warm fingers wrapping around her own. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I took so long to return.&quot; Wendy apologized, &quot;Did you read my 
letter?&quot;  

Jennifer nodded fanatically, &quot;Yes, and I have one for you in return.&quot; 
She slipped the letter through the window to have it eagerly seized by 
the girl. 

&quot;I&#39;ll come back soon.&quot; Wendy assured Jennifer and lightly squeezed the 
girl&#39;s fingers, then, just as before, she vanished from sight. 

Jennifer struggled to close the window and shivered against the cold. A 
cold that only touched her surface of her body, for her insides felt 
warm all over. She dropped to her bed to brush the snow off the back of 
the mattress then laid down, wondering how Wendy would take the news of 
her true self. She prayed that Wendy would not see her any differently 
and would return with wings on. 

This time she only had to wait four days before she heard Wendy clear 
away the snow around her window. The very sound made her heart leap with 
joy, &#39;She returned after all.&#39; She thought to herself, with a smile upon 
her face. She quickly clambered onto the bed to see mitten-covered hands 
clearing away the snow around the window and the smiling face of Wendy 
peering down at her. 

Without hast Jennifer opened the window, &quot;I was worried you would not 
return.&quot; She stated, still uncertain that the girl really did return to 
her. 

&quot;I will always return to you.&quot; Wendy stated with a grin, &quot;You are my 
Prince after all.&quot; She reached into her pocket and retrieved yet another 
letter, &quot;Here.&quot; 

Jennifer excitedly reached through the crack to take the letter in hand 
and pulled it close to her chest, &quot;When will I see you again?&quot; She 
inquired anxiously. 

&quot;How is Tuesday?&quot; Wendy asked. 

Jennifer nodded, that would only mean three days to wait, &quot;I&#39;ll be sure 
to be here.&quot; She stated with a nod of assurance. 

Wendy grinned, &quot;I&#39;ll see you soon, My Prince.&quot; Before Jennifer could 
respond the girl got to her feet and rushed off. 

Jennifer pushed the window closed, with some effort, the quickly 
unfolded her newest letter and read it: 

&lt;i&gt; My dear Prince in disguise, 
I sort of had this feeling. That man had introduced me to you before and 
that last time you seemed so different. There was something that I 
cannot explain about when I looked into your eyes. I hope you enjoyed my 
rose.
I wish I could be there with you right now. &lt;/i&gt;

Jennifer sunk into her bed with her back to the wall as she read the 
letter over and over again. Wendy knew that she wasn&#39;t a boy and didn&#39;t 
seem to mind. Her eyes moved to the dried out rose and held the letter 
close to her heart. Something about the letter gave her some hope in the 
world. 

Quickly she rushed over to desk and pulled her chair up close. Without 
hast she drew out a piece of paper and a pencil. Within moments words 
began to fill her mind and she allowed them to flow out over the page. 

&lt;i&gt; &quot;Dear Wendy,
Yes, I wish you were here too. I am so happy to have seen you again and 
I loved the rose, I do not recall telling you that. I wish we could we 
could fly away from here and leave this place behind. I guess that 
sounds crazy, but that is how I feel.
I am so glad we met and you came to my window that day. I hope to hear 
from you again.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;

Again she hid the letter under her mattress, in the same place as 
before. She placed the letter from Wendy in her suitcase, with the 
other, and then happily skipped up the stairs. She never thought she 
would have a skip in her step again, but now she had a reason to live. 
No matter how horrible this place was she would work until the day she 
got to be with Wendy. As she reached the upstairs hall her cheerful 
domineer quickly faded as the mumbling of the man&#39;s voice began to drift 
down the hall. He was singing that dreadful poem again and the very 
sound of it made all of her dreams of being with Wendy evaporate as 
quickly as snow on a hot summer&#39;s day. 

Cautiously, Jennifer crept down the hall. The man only sung that song on 
a few occasions and usually it was on those days that Jenn could see 
more despair in his eyes then normal. Once again she wondered what the 
song meant. Was he trying to tell her that he really did kill his own 
son and if so what was Jennifer to do about it? Concerned for the man 
she moved towards the sounds, in search of him.

She reached the intersection and glanced around. The man&#39;s voice seemed 
to be drifting from the right, where the man&#39;s study was. Carefully 
Jennifer slid up to the door and listened closely. He continued to 
recite his poem, or song, or whatever he thought it was, over and over 
again in a droll flat tone as if he were in some sort of trace. 

Summing all her will, Jennifer grasped the doorknob and slowly turned 
it. There was a soft click that caused the girl to freeze in place. She 
waited, motionless, listening for some kind of movement from the other 
side of the door. However, the man did not seem to notice and continued 
on with his rambling. Extra attentively she pushed the door open a crack 
and peered inside. 

As first all she could see was the man sitting at his desk in the far 
right corner of the room, next to a small window. She had only been in 
this room a few times to clean and pretty much stayed out of the room 
when the man was inside of it. There was the desk that he now sat at and 
a small bookshelf took up the left wall, other then that it was a very 
empty room. The man&#39;s back was to the girl as he sat upon an old wooden 
chair. Slowly, he rocked in the chair as he spoke the words of his song. 
She could hear the words more clearly now and they sent a shiver through 
her spine. 

Curiosity, and maybe a bit of sympathy for the man, pulled Jennifer 
further into the room. Then she saw the gun and stopped dead in her 
tracks. The man was staring at the weapon as he rocked in place. The 
chamber was open and he spun it with the thumb of his left hand. From 
where Jennifer stood she could see that all six slots were loaded and a 
box of ammo sat upon the desk before the man. Suddenly the man snapped 
the chamber in place, startling the girl, and placed the barrel to his 
temple. 

&quot;Good night, young pea... Good night, young pea.&quot; His hand began to 
tremble as he says these words. 

Jennifer turned her head as she prepared for the gunshot. When no shot 
rang out and the man started up his song again and Jennifer opened her 
eyes to find the man still sitting before her, the gun still upon his 
head as he rocked in his chair. Jennifer shook her head in confusion and 
fright, then turned and bolted from the room. She headed straight to her 
room and threw herself upon the bed, crying into her pillow. She was to 
tired of being afraid and wanted nothing more then to be away from that 
place. Then she remembered Wendy, her only connection to the outside 
world. She preyed that Wendy would return to her and take her away from 
this prison.
