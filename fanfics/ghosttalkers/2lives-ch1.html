fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Misaki Saiki walked to the door with confidence, the white haired young 
woman nodding in greeting to the doorman. &quot;Welcome, mistress,&quot; the 
tuxedo clad man nodded as she entered the S&amp;M club called Murmure.

&quot;How are the bookings tonight?&quot; Misaki asked him wryly, the cloth of her 
blue dress swirling around her long, well shaped legs. At her side a 
purse swung, the large bag colored to match the pretty dress that she 
wore.

&quot;About average, madam,&quot; he murmured.

Taking a deep breath Misaki headed up the stairs to the club itself, 
beginning the mental process she went into getting ready to work every 
night. The young man who handled their bookings smiled as Misaki 
aproached, his dark hair falling into his eyes. &quot;Welcome,&quot; he smiled.

&quot;Asano,&quot; Misaki nodded, &quot;do I have a client waiting?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Asano smiled slightly, &quot;but one&#39;s booked for half-past, as you 
prefer.&quot; One time back when he first started here he had mistakenly 
booked a client just before Misaki was to arrive, and she had been badly 
rushed to satisfy the man. She had dealt with the client then proveeded 
to take a few strips off of Asano after that, quickly teaching him not 
to make that kind of error again.

&quot;Good,&quot; Misaki said, &quot;any special requests?&quot;

&quot;Not precisely but...&quot; Asano paused.

&quot;Out with it,&quot; Misaki gave him a pained look, wondering what the client 
wanted. The last time Asano looked that sheepish Misaki had ended up 
pissing on a businessman for a substantial bonus. It had all been pretty 
uncomfortable, especially considering how much water Misaki had to drink 
down beforehand to pull it off.

&quot;Nothing like that,&quot; Asano hastened to say, &quot;it&#39;s just that the client 
is a woman.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; Misaki blinked. Female clients weren&#39;t exactly rare, but they 
usually prefered to see a male dominant rather than someone like her. 
&quot;She didn&#39;t get bumped off someone else&#39;s schedule, did she?&quot; she 
wondered.

&quot;No ma&#39;am,&quot; Asano reassured her, &quot;she requested a female dominant.&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Misaki murmured. She shook herself, &quot;She&#39;s in my usual 
room?&quot;

&quot;Everything&#39;s ready,&quot; Asano confirmed.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll meet her there,&quot; Misaki said calmly, &quot;once I get changed.&quot;

With that Misaki strode from the room, heading up the hall to the 
changing room that the dominants shared. She closed the door behind her 
and reached around behind her back, undoing the zipper for her dress. 
She grasped the cloth and pulled, sending it pubbling around her legs 
and revealing the other side of her personality.

Red leather clung to Misaki&#39;s curves, the corset pushing up her breasts 
and cupping them, the nipples hidden by the upper edge of material. 
Black laces held it shut, criss crossing over her pale flesh to where 
the corset ended at her belly. The matching panties were pulled tight to 
her skin, the complete hairlessness of her mound evident in how clearly 
her cleft showed. She pulled matching red leather gloves from her purse 
and pulled them on, tugging them into place, then made sure the red 
boots she wore were comfortable.

Without a word Misaki headed to her dungeon, the room that was set up 
for her personal use in the club. Silently she entered, pausing to see 
the woman standing submissively in the corner, her blonde hair flowing 
over her shoulders, her eyes looking down at the floor.

&quot;Strip,&quot; Misaki commanded, her voice startling in the silence.

Blue eyes looked up to meet Misaki&#39;s and then she hurriedly pulled her 
suit off, the business wear carefully folded away as the young woman 
dropped to her knees respectfully, her pale skin gleaming in the dimly 
lit room. There was nervousness in her stance, a faint quiver in her 
limbs and she swallowed uncomfortably.

Misaki felt the woman&#39;s eyes on her, the searching gaze as she casually 
walked to the far wall where all the tools of her trade waited. Without 
thinking about it she drew down hee favorite riding crop, walking back 
to the girl&#39;s side, studying her intently, the beautiful skin and 
shapely body.

Misaki ran a hand over her shoulder and heard a soft gasp. &quot;Do you want 
marks or just bruises?&quot; Misaki asked thoughtfully. There was a beat of 
tense silence and Misako smiled, &quot;You have permision to speak.&quot;

&quot;Bruises, Mistress,&quot; she answered respectfully, her voice startlingly 
musical.

&quot;So be it,&quot; Misaki answered cooly, wondering how that lovely voice would 
sound crying. She drew her riding crop back then struck, leather 
slapping against flesh for the first time that night... but surely not 
the last.

The next morning Misaki fought back a yawn as she sat in the sun light 
at a casual street corner cafe, her hair messy and eyes half closed. Ai 
Kunugi looked over at her with concern, the brown haired girl clutching 
her ever present teddy bear. &quot;Is everything all right?&quot; the high school 
student asked worriedly, looking even younger in her simple dress.

&quot;Just tired,&quot; Misaki answered without thinking, &quot;I had a client who 
wanted some really rough play last night...&quot; The shorts and T-shirt clad 
woman trailed off, seeing the blush that colored Ai&#39;s cheeks. The young 
woman had entered Misaki&#39;s worlds after the murder of her older sister 
and niece, but she clearly wasn&#39;t yet used to what Misaki did for a 
living.

&quot;You could have slept in,&quot; Ai offered uncomfortably, &quot;I&#39;m sure that 
Soichiro-san and I could handle anything that came up.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re pretty confident sounding for someone who&#39;s so new to being a 
medium,&quot; Misaki teased gently. With another yawn she said, &quot;Soichiro 
asked for me to be here specifically, so I figure he&#39;s got a good 
reason.&quot;

Misaki smiled, looking at the sweet young girl bemusedly, wondering at 
the odd fate that made them both mediums. As a child Misaki had begun to 
manifest such gifts, something deeply confusing to the shy girl she was, 
while Ai had only manifested recently, and was still struggling to come 
to grips with her abilities.

Misaki stifled another yawn, thinking back to the night before. Usually 
being a mistress was just a job, turning her muscle and willpower to 
taming the darkness in other&#39;s hearts but last night had been different. 
To her own surprise she had felt herself becoming excited as she 
punished the blonde skillfully, drawing out the cries and moans from 
her, smelling the heady scent of her passion. For the first time Misaki 
had been tempted to command a sub to pleasure her body, and only a firm 
knowledge of the club&#39;s rules had stopped her.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Ai asked curiously, &quot;You&#39;ve gone all red.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Misaki growled.

The off-blue car pulled up, just the sort of vehicle you&#39;d expect a 
salaryman to be driving. Climbing out of the car Soichiro looked like a 
salaryman, too, a mild mannered man with brown hair and glasses, but he 
had hidden depths. He could fight like the best street punk and was a 
absolute coward around ghosts.. a ironic quality condidering he worked 
for the Living Enviroment Division, the city agency that dealt with 
ghosts.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Soichiro said to them cheerfully, pausing even as 
another figure climbed out of the car.

Misaki saw her approach and helt a moment of stunned surprise.. one 
clearly matched in the eyes of the blonde. &quot;Who the hell&#39;s this?&quot; she 
demanded, pointing at the woman who had been last night&#39;s client, the 
one who had tired her so much.

Soichiro seemed entirely unbothered by her forcefulness, he was used to 
it by now, but the woman paled visibly. &quot;This is Haruna Tamura, she&#39;s my 
new assistant,&quot; he explained as he pulled out a chair and sat, waving 
for Haruna to sit, too, then ordered them a round of tea.

&quot;It&#39;s very nice to meet you,&quot; Haruna said as she sat, wincing a bit as 
her back hit the hard metal chair the cafe prefered.

Misaki was impressed by the woman&#39;s poise, she knew the woman&#39;s back was 
a mass of bruises from their session last night but she still carried on 
normally as Ai hesitantly introduced herself. &quot;Nice to meet you too,&quot; 
she said dryly. Looking over at Soichiro she asked, &quot;So who did she piss 
off to get assigned here?&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Haruna protested mildly.

&quot;Actually she requested the assignment,&quot; Soichiro said calmly. Finishing 
his tea he said, &quot;We&#39;ve got two haunted houses to check out today, shall 
we go?&quot;

Haruna got up obediantly along with Ai, but Misaki sat a moment studying 
the young woman. &quot;Right,&quot; she said after a long moment and followed to 
the car. &#39;This is going to be interesting,&#39; she thought.

There was some confusion over who would sit where but Misaki settled 
that by climbing into the back seat with Ai. As the car took off Ai 
began, &quot;Miss Misaki, do you know...&quot;

&quot;Do you mind if I get changed here?&quot; Misaki cut her off, knowing she 
really didn&#39;t want to answer that question.

Ai blushed but answered levelly, &quot;It sould be all right.&quot;

Briskly Misaki yanked off her shorts and top, revealing the one piece 
pvc swimsuit she wore, the sort of fetish wear she normaly used on these 
jobs. Oddly she found them easy to move in and comfortable when 
channeling the spirits. As she stretched out a bit to discard the shorts 
she looked up to see both Soichiro and Haruna peering in the rearview 
mirror, blushes coloring their cheeks.

&quot;Eyes on the road,&quot; Misaki barked to both of them and they guiltily 
turned back to the road, barely dodging another vehicle.

The first stop was a false alarm, but the second one.. that was the real 
deal. Poor Soichiro practically pissed himself as the spirit manifested 
through Misaki, with Ai standing by his and Haruna&#39;s side offering 
naration of what was going on. Once Misaki got a grip on what the ghost 
wanted she reasoned with it, and eventually felt the spirit pass on.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Soichiro sighed then moved off to phone in a report to his 
superior.

Silently Misaki met Haruna&#39;s eyes and nodded to a room away from where 
Ai and he were standing, then walked off briskly. Haruna followed a 
moment later, closing the door behind her as she quietly said, &quot;I didn&#39;t 
know.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Misaki asked flatly.

&quot;I knew about you in general,&quot; Haruna conceded that, &quot;but I had no idea 
that the mistress I met last night would be the medium I met this 
morning.&quot;

Misaki met her eyes, but had to decide she was telling the truth. To be 
honest Misaki doubted that the woman could have faked the surprise she 
had shown when they met earlier that day. &quot;Fair enough,&quot; she nodded.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry if this made things uncomfortable for you,&quot; Haruna said.

&quot;I&#39;ll manage,&quot; Misaki said, &quot;and you might want to try to be a bit more 
forceful. When Soichiro is gone you&#39;ll be in charge after all.&quot;

&quot;Somehow I can&#39;t imagine topping you,&quot; Haruna blushed, &quot;but I&#39;ll try.&quot;

Misaki studied Haruna a moment, silently considering how she felt last 
night, then quietly said, &quot;I think Asano can find a opening in my 
schedule tonight if you were to come to Murmure.&quot;

Haruna&#39;s eyes widened a bit then she smiled, &quot;I&#39;&#39;d be honored, 
mistress.&quot;

End

Notes: This is based off of the 4-episode anime and an article in 
Newtype magazine, and probably contradicts the much longer manga series. 
In the anime Misaki is surprisingly non-erotic for a dominatrix, and 
seems to have no real sexual partners. She teases Soichiro and uses him 
as a punching bag, but that seems about it.</pre>
