<pre>	Her lips were soft against mine, mischievous blue eyes closed 
tightly; blonde hair falling down across her face and masking dark 
lashes. I knew this would be a moment forever etched in my memory. I&#146;d 
seen this expression on her face before, but never so closely. She 
pulled away after a moment, eyes uncharacteristically downcast. 

	&quot;Doujima?&quot; I breathed softly, not yet daring to move.
	
	&quot;Gomen nasai, Robin-chan.&quot; She muttered and started to turn away.
I reached out to place one hand on her shoulder, which then became the 
object of Doujima&#146;s intense scrutiny. I started to reach out with my 
other hand and then paused. Her eyes shifted to study that hand, which I 
then rested lightly on her cheek. She nuzzled it a moment and then 
turned her eyes back to my face. The previous momentary shadow had flown 
and their normal sparkle had returned. She kissed me again; not once but 
several times in rapid succession, almost smothering me with energetic 
affection. She wasn&#146;t content with just my lips either but placed soft, 
swift kisses all over my face; forehead, eyelids, cheeks and jaw line.

	&quot;Doujima,&quot; I tried to protest ineffectually, moving my other hand
to rest on her other shoulder but not finding the strength to push her 
away.

	&quot;Hai, Robin-chan?&quot; She inquired merrily, her line of kisses 
dropping from my jaw down to my neck. I stumbled a half-step back to 
lean against the bar behind me, hands falling down to rest on the bar 
stools to either side of me to keep from falling. She followed quite 
contently, hands moving to the bar on either side of my waist and, 
consciously or unconsciously, trapping me there.  I could feel her lips
&#150; and now liberally applied tongue &#150; work their way lower. She was 
obviously just as inexperienced in such things as I, however what she 
lacked in skill she more than made up for in zeal. Her fingers were 
already going for the bindings of the rather revealing shirt I wore in 
the employ of Master and while the command for her to stop rose to my 
lips, I just couldn&#146;t say it. She paused in her tongue bath of my 
shoulders to finish unbinding my shirt, biting her lower lip in 
concentration; an expression I had to admit was more than a little 
adorable. She noticed my scrutiny of her face and straightened to 
impetusly kiss my lips once more, forcing her tongue between lips 
partially open with surprise. My shirt now nothing more than a pile of 
discarded cloth on the ground, Doujima wasted no time in running eager 
hands over my bare upper body. Between fingertips that raced like
liquid fire over my skin and the fiercely enthusiastic tongue roving 
around my mouth, I couldn&#146;t contain the moan that rose from some 
secret place locked deep within my chest. My eyes fell half closed 
and I could feel fire burning within me. I felt as much as heard her 
delighted giggle against my lips at my moan, shuddering slightly as 
her impatient hands found and wandered over my breasts. 

	Pulling away from the kiss, her face was set with its normal 
mischievous grin as she began chanting my name as if it were some kind 
of childhood rhyme. &quot;Ro-bin-chan~ Ro-bin-chan~ Ro-bin-chan~&quot; Her little
self-made verse dissolved into a giggling fit that had me laughing 
quietly despite myself. 

	&quot;Doujima,&quot; I just had to say her name in return, the single 
fond word catching her attention and earning me a flash of her wide 
smile. Deciding that she shouldn&#146;t have to do all the work, I brought 
both of my hands up from where they rested on the stools at my side and
captured each side of her face in one hand before closing my eyes and 
kissing her in reply. She made a soft, surprised noise against my lips 
and I saw fire flash behind my eyelids. When I pulled away from the 
kiss her face was blurry and indistinct, though I thought her lips were
set in a round &quot;O&quot; of surprise. I could feel the warmth of fire around 
my shoulders and knew instinctively that I&#146;d surrounded the two of us 
in a wreath of flame that rose above us and twisted in time with the 
fire building inside of me. Not wanting to accidentally burn down 
Master&#146;s establishment I forced the fire to die away, though Doujima 
still looked impressed by the momentary feat. 

	Taking my hands in hers, she playfully commanded me to let her 
take care of me. When I tried to protest she silenced me with a mock 
stern look and a finger on my lips. After a moment I nodded and she 
briefly replaced her finger with her lips before disappearing abruptly.
I blinked in surprised and looked down to see her kneeling before me, 
hands busy with the buttons on my pants. I cried out her name in 
surprise but she merely gave me an annoyed look, finished unbutton my 
pants and pulled them down without preamble. I leaned back against the 
bar when she spoke my name again and began nuzzling my stomach, my 
knuckles going white from gripping the wooden countertop so tightly. 
She then began to flick her tongue out, as if to taste skin seemingly 
at random. Just below my navel, just above each knee, where leg and hip
met on both sides. Then in an ever tightening circle along those five 
points that had me shuddering with the power of that growing inner 
flame. After completing her circle the final time, she wasted no time 
diving in among lower folds; seeking out and finding my clitoris to 
shower it with the same fervent attention of her tongue.  I was panting
now, head twisted to one side and my hips shifting restlessly despite 
my best intention. 

	The sudden invasion of two fingers inside of me caught me off 
guard and I cried out in surprise. She giggled again at my reaction and,
face pressed so close against skin I could feel the vibrations of the 
sound as well. It took her only another moment&#146;s diligent effort to 
bring me to the edge and over; fire springing to life almost of its own
will and dancing about in time with the black spots in my vision, only 
to fade away with them. Breathless and inexplicably weak, I clung to 
the counter for support as Doujima rose to her feet with a triumphant 
grin and kissed my again. Her lips and tongue had a peculiar taste I 
couldn&#146;t place at first. It was only after she pulled away that I 
realized what it was, facing growing a bit hot when I realized it was 
the taste of, well. Me. I reached out and pulled her close to taste 
that flavor again but she pushed me away with a teasing rebuke and 
started to walk away.

	&quot;Doujima!&quot; I called after her, wanting her to come back. 
However she simply blew me a kiss and winked before throwing a flippant
good-bye over her shoulder and leaving the restaurant. I simply stood 
there a moment before I had the presence of mind to recover my clothing
and wits for the trip home.</pre>
