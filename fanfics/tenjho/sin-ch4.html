<h1>Sin (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenjho/index.html">Tenjho Tenge</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbman.html">cbman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenjho/sin-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Author&#146;s Note: I finally started collecting the original Japanese 
Tenjho Tenge manga and reading online translations for it.  Right now I
have volumes 1 through 11, I can definitely say I really deviated away 
from the original story with this fic.  Unfortunately I won&#146;t be able 
to fit in characters in the manga such as Madoka, Souhaku, and the rest
of Team F, maybe I&#146;ll write another Tenjho Tenge fic later based on the
manga, but we&#146;ll see.  Anyways, in the last chapter, Maya started to 
realize she had new found feelings for Aya, but she believes that an 
intimate relationship would be impossible because of its immorality and
the fact that Aya is in love with Souichiro.  Of course we know the two
will eventually end up together, and in this chapter, we&#146;ll learn why 
Aya isn&#146;t with Souichiro any longer in the prologue.  Also, Isuzu makes
an appearance in this chapter, and unfortunately here&#146;s where some of 
the deviation comes in, she&#146;s a lot stronger in this fic than her anime
and manga counterparts.  Well with that said, let&#146;s go back to the 
story.

Kiss


(Maya&#146;s POV)

	
It&#146;s been five days since Aya took me out to the water park, and during
those past few days, I haven&#146;t been able to get her out of my mind.  I 
haven&#146;t thought of Mitsuomi as often as I did ever since he passed away
nearly a week ago, instead my thoughts are constantly filled with my 
sister&#146;s words and smiles.  That night five days ago when she let me 
sleep with her, it was the last time I could recall I ever had a good 
night&#146;s rest.  But my brain continues to tear at itself, tearing at the
thoughts that I may be falling for my own sister.
	
I keep trying to tell myself that I can&#146;t fall in love with Aya, I 
can&#146;t love my sister in any other way.  It&#146;s supposed to be immoral to 
fall in love with someone that&#39;s the same gender as you, and it&#146;s even 
more immoral if that someone is in the same family as you, immediate 
family especially.  Even if it is immoral, I can&#146;t deny the fact that 
whenever I&#146;ve been with her these last few days, I feel as if my spirit
has been lifted, that her smile was enough to make me feel alive.
	
&#147;Souichiro-sama, say &#145;aaaahhhhh!&#146;,&#148; I turn to my sister, watching her 
trying to feed her homemade obento again.
	
&#147;There&#146;s no way I&#146;m gonna eat that,&#148; he tells her in his usual angry 
tone.  &#147;Day after day after day after day after day after day after day
you keep trying to feed me that poison.  When are you gonna get it 
through your head I&#146;m not going to eat that crap for a meal?!&#148;
	
&#147;Don&#146;t be mean, Souichiro-sama, at least try it,&#148; she tries to force a 
chopstick full of pork into his mouth.
	
&#147;Never, even if you try to force it down my throat!&#148; he tells her as he
dodges the food.
	
&#147;Souichiro-sama!&#148;
	
I sigh as I watch those two.  That kid is so immature sometimes, it 
won&#146;t do him any harm to try any of my sister&#146;s lunch.  I eat it all 
the time, her meals are always very delicious I find, better than any 
restaurant I&#146;ve ever been to.
	
&#147;Oneechan, say &#145;aaaahhhhh!&#146;,&#148; I imagine her trying to feed me one of 
her meals.
	
&#147;Aaaahhhhh...  Huh?!&#148; I find myself suddenly being pushed to the floor.
	
&#147;Sorry, little girl!&#148; I turn to the side to find the kid running.
	
&#147;Souichiro-sama, come back here!&#148; my sister tries to chase him.
	
&#147;Aya, let him go,&#148; I tell her as I dust myself off.  &#147;Actually I&#146;m a 
little hungry myself, if you don&#146;t mind, could you...?&#148;
	
&#147;Oh, okay, Oneechan,&#148; my sister stops.
	
Wait, what am I doing?  I never needed Aya to feed me before, why was I
just daydreaming it just now.  Stop it, Maya, just stop it.  You still 
have a chance to refuse her lunch, you don&#146;t have to take it.  No, I 
want to take it, I don&#146;t care what my mind says, it&#146;s not like there&#146;s 
anything sensual about it; sisters can still feed each other meals and 
not have anything behind it.  Yes, that&#146;s all it is, that&#146;s all I&#146;m 
asking of her, nothing more.
	
I close my eyes now my mouth opening wide.  I wait for several seconds,
but the food never comes.  I continue to wait with my jaw wide open, 
but I still get nothing.  I open my eyes now to find my sister no 
longer standing in front of me the lunch no longer in her hands.  I 
begin to search the area to look for her, but she&#146;s nowhere to be 
found.  I then turn toward my lap to find her lunch sitting there, the 
handkerchief for the box opened and a pair of chopsticks laid on the 
surface.  Not wanting to have the lunch go to waste, I take the 
chopsticks into my hand now and pluck a portion of rice into my mouth.
	
&#147;Idiot...,&#148; I say under my breath.
	
I thought the two of us would be alone for the weekend, but she went 
ahead and invited the rest of Jyuken Club over for training.  I suppose
this was the only way for her to get her beloved &#147;Souichiro-sama&#148; to 
come over.  I envy that kid; my sister is so devoted to him, and yet he
doesn&#146;t even acknowledge her.  I wish she could show me the same 
devotion.  Great, listen to myself, I sound like a love-struck 
schoolgirl.
	
&#147;It&#146;ll never happen,&#148; I sigh.
	
&#147;What will never happen, Captain?&#148; I turn around to find Takayanagi 
standing behind me.
	
&#147;It&#146;s nothing,&#148; I answer, &#147;I&#146;m just talking to myself, that&#146;s all.&#148;


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


(Souichiro&#146;s POV)

	
&#147;Souichiro-sama!&#148;
	
Damn her, always trying to feed me that crap.  I wanted to use this 
weekend to train, but she keeps chasing me around, I can&#146;t seem to 
concentrate.  Every corner I turn, every door I open, no matter where I
go, she&#146;s always there waiting.  I swear, just what makes her think she
can just call herself my wife.  Can&#146;t she just leave me alone for one 
second?
	
I stop now in my tracks, realizing that there&#146;s someone else on this 
path.  I hear Aya&#146;s running footsteps starting to draw closer, slowing 
down seconds later and finally coming to a stop next to me.  I take a 
moment to observe this individual, my fingers balling into fists the
moment I realize the identity of this woman.  Pink-haired curls, blue 
eyes, a slim figure, a black shirt and white skirt and jacket, there&#146;s 
no mistaking it, it&#146;s Mitsuomi&#146;s lap dog, Isuzu Emi.
	
&#147;What do you want?&#148; I ask the wench.  &#147;This is private property you 
know.&#148;
	
&#147;Hmph, such rude words for one of the Nagi Family,&#148; she scoffs.  &#147;No 
matter, I came here today to ask Natsume-san a few questions.&#148;
	
&#147;Yeah, well the little girl doesn&#146;t want to answer those questions!&#148; I 
retort, remembering how she tied Bob and I up the last time we went to 
the Enforcers&#146; office.
	
&#147;Souichiro-sama, stop it,&#148; Aya orders me.  &#147;I&#146;m sorry, Isuzu-san, but 
what is it that you&#146;d like to ask Oneechan?&#148;
	
&#147;It&#146;s come to my attention that Mitsuomi-san met with your sister on 
the night of his death,&#148; she explains.  &#147;I simply wanted to ask her 
what the reasons were for the meeting and what happened during that 
time.&#148;
	
&#147;Isn&#146;t that just an excuse for you to beat the little girl up some 
more?&#148; I ask.  &#147;I know how your kind thinks, you&#146;ll use any excuse to 
beat down your opponent.&#148;
	
&#147;And I know your kind as well,&#148; she says, keeping her calm demeanor.  
&#147;You&#146;ll do or say anything to pick a fight with someone.  What you said
back in the office that day, when that oaf, Tawara, obliterated you, it
was just an excuse to get back at us for what happened during the
bowling alley incident, wasn&#146;t it?&#148;
	
&#147;If it had been my old self that was defeated back then, then yeah, 
that would precisely be it,&#148; I tell her.  &#147;Too bad my words that day 
were true.&#148;
	
&#147;Souichiro-sama...?&#148;
	
&#147;I told you and that old man that little girl was my first love and I 
would be willing to lay my life down for her as many times need be.  
Like I said, this is private property, so I suggest you leave right 
away.&#148;
	
My entire body begins to grow warm, electricity beginning to form 
around me.  I close my eyes, the energy in my body flowing freely into 
my arms and chest.  The flow that was inside me comes to a stop a 
moment later, my eyes opening once more to find the bread-haired girl 
still standing in front of me.
	
&#147;You&#146;ve learned a few new tricks I see,&#148; she says, still not backing 
down from my alternate form.  &#147;What do you think this is, &#145;Dragon Ball 
Z?&#146;&#148;
	
&#147;This ain&#146;t no &#145;Kamehameha,&#146;&#148; I tell the wench as I gather energy into 
my fist.  &#147;Tanshinkou!&#148;
	
I throw the energy that gathered into my hand at this point, throwing 
it in a wave of my arm.  The attack misses, striking the ground 
instead, filling the area with clouds of dust.  I look upward to find 
her jumping toward me through the dusty fog, her foot pushing against 
my face and knocking me to the floor.  I quickly shake off the effects 
of her attack, charging in with my fist again.  She catches my fist 
somehow with her hand, all of its force absorbed into her palm.  A
sharp pain then jolts into the back of my hand after as she lets go of 
my fist, jumping backward to her original spot.  I look to the source 
of the pain to find a kunai lodged into it, that pain returning shortly
after I pry it from my hand.
	
&#147;Souichiro-sama!&#148; Aya cries, taking hold of my injured hand after.
	
&#147;Back off, Aya,&#148; I order.  &#147;This is my fight.&#148;
	
The wench continue to stand there, her arms resting at her sides.  I 
charge in once more with another punch, but she somehow manages to 
dodge this one with a simple side step.  I try to follow with a hook 
with my other arm, but she dodges this one as well.  I continue with 
similar attacks after that, but I notice that the speed in my punches 
is decreasing with each attempted blow.  My legs are beginning to lose 
momentum as well, my body feels as if its slowly being dragged into the
ground.  It gets so bad that my last punch barely reaches forward, and 
at this point, my enemy grabs hold of my arm, lifting my entire body 
into the air and slamming it back into the ground afterwards.  I try to
return to my feet, but for some reason, my legs won&#146;t move.  My arms 
are exactly the same as well, along with every part of my body.
	
&#147;Get up, Souichiro-sama!&#148; Aya screams.
	
&#147;He won&#146;t be getting back up,&#148; the bread-haired girl says.  &#147;That kunai
was laced with a paralysis oil.  Don&#146;t worry, it&#146;s nothing fatal and is
only temporary.  I don&#146;t care if you convert energy into strength or 
whatever that business was back in the bowling alley, it&#146;s useless if 
your body&#146;s nerves aren&#146;t working.&#148;
	
&#147;You cheap...!&#148;
	
&#147;I believe it was you who said that &#145;anything goes in a fight,&#146; am I 
right?&#148; she asks.  &#147;I guess now wouldn&#146;t be the best time to ask 
Natsume-san then, I&#146;ll probably come back some other time.  Ciao!&#148;
	
&#147;Wait, this fight isn&#146;t over yet!&#148; I yell as she turns away.  &#147;Hey, 
don&#146;t walk away from me, get over here!&#148;
	
&#147;Souichiro-sama, stop it!&#148; Aya orders, her arms wrapping around my 
shoulders.  &#147;You&#146;ll only provoke her further, and in your condition, 
you can&#146;t move right now either.  Please, Souichiro-sama, don&#146;t...&#148;
	
&#147;Don&#146;t tell me what I can and cannot do!&#148; I spit.
	
&#147;Souichiro-sa...&#148;
	
&#147;And stop calling me that!&#148; I continue.  &#147;What makes you think you can 
just go running around claiming to be my wife, well you know what, it&#146;s
not going to happen, even in your wildest dreams!&#148; I tell her at the 
top of my lungs.  &#147;You said it yourself, didn&#146;t you, you&#146;ll break off 
our engagement if I lose another fight, right?  Well consider our 
engagement off then!  Actually, I never cared about our so-called 
&#145;engagement,&#146; I don&#146;t even know why I put up with it.  I never loved 
you, I&#146;ll never love you, in fact, I hate you!&#148;
	
&#147;So...Souichiro-sama, how can you such hurtful things...?&#148; her eyes 
begin to water.
	
&#147;I can say them because it&#146;s true,&#148; I answer.  &#147;Now get out of my 
sight!&#148;
	
She leaves after that, tears quickly rolling down her eyes and sobs 
escaping her voice.  That stupid bread-haired girl, I swear I&#146;ll pay 
her back for this!  After all that training, I still can&#146;t hold a 
candle against most of the punks at school.  Stronger, I need to become
stronger, strong enough so that I can beat down anyone who gets in my 
way!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


(Aya&#146;s POV)

	
I feel as if my entire being is split in two, the tears can&#146;t stop 
falling.  I run, but I don&#146;t care where I run to.  I want to run into 
his arms, but no matter how badly I want to do so, I know that he will 
only turn me away.
	
&#147;What makes you think you can just go running around claiming to be my 
wife, well you know what, it&#146;s not going to happen, even in your 
wildest dreams!&#148; his words repeat in my ears.
	
What made me believe?  I thought it was fate.  I thought it was our 
destiny that brought us together on that day in school, I thought that 
our future together would be bright.  I always imagined what it would 
be like to be your wife, how I would never leave your side, but no 
matter what I did to try and make you happy, I only angered you.  I 
thought it was your own way of showing your appreciation, but...
	
&#147;Aya, what&#146;s wrong?&#148; Oneechan asks as I brush past her.
	
I say nothing as I run past her, my thoughts still lingering on his 
words.  I head into my room now, shutting the door swiftly the moment I
walk in.  I begin to huddle into the corner of my room now, my arms 
hugging my legs as I bury my face into my knees.  The tears are still
falling, they haven&#146;t shown any signs of stopping.
	
&#147;It&#146;s not Souichiro-sama&#146;s fault,&#148; I try to tell myself, &#147;it&#146;s not his 
fault for feeling the way he does.  There&#146;s no way I can control his 
feelings, there&#146;s nothing I can do to change them.  But despite 
that...!&#148;
	
I really did think I could change him, I kept lying to myself that if I
continued to be with him, he would return my affection.  How I feel 
about him, it was the first time I ever felt that way about any man.  
The burning sensation in my heart, the blush in my cheeks, the 
trembling in my knees, I felt so weak, yet so empowered at the same 
time.  There were times when Oneechan made me feel in such ways, but
that&#39;s because we&#39;re sisters.
	
I try to hug a stuffed bear that sits close to me, burying my tears 
into its fur, but it does nothing to calm me down like how it normally 
does.  I know I told Oneechan that it makes me feel better when I&#146;m 
upset, but it was because every time I did so, I always imagined it was
Souichiro-sama.  Was I a fool to have given my heart to him?  Was I not
thinking when I devoted my entire being to him?  I don&#146;t know, I don&#146;t 
know...  I just...  I just want things to end here, to end now, but I 
won&#146;t, I can&#146;t leave Oneechan alone, I don&#146;t want to make her cry, even
if it means I have to suffer...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


(Maya&#146;s POV)

	
Aya, she was crying just now.  She was fine when she chased after the 
punk into the forest, but when she came out...
	
The mentioned brat appears now, his entire body wobbling as he exits 
the forest.  My emotions begin to take over once again, my teeth 
clenching against one another and my nails burying themselves into my 
palms.  Just the sight of the punk angers me, something it never did in
the past.
	
&#147;Souichiro, what happened?&#148; the foreigner asks him.  &#147;You look like 
crap.&#148;
	
&#147;Shut up,&#148; the blond punk growls, &#147;that stupid Vice President of the 
Enforcers showed up and...!  Huh, what?&#148; he asks as I step in front of 
him.
	
I find my hand swinging to the side, now, the palm of my hand stinging 
after it strikes the side of the kid&#146;s face.  I find my own eyes 
beginning to tear after striking his face, my eyes not watering from 
the pain the impact made on my hand, but from the pain that is now in 
my sister&#146;s heart.
	
&#147;Captain...,&#148; Takayanagi and the others look shocked, &#147;why...?&#148;
	
&#147;...get out of here...,&#148; are the only words I can muster.  &#147;...get out 
of here...&#148;
	
&#147;Huh, what?&#148;
	
&#147;I said get out of here!&#148; I yell at the top of my lungs.  
	
&#147;What&#146;s with...?&#148;
	
&#147;You made Aya cry!&#148; I find my hands taking hold of the kid&#146;s collar. 
&#147;Do you even know how much she devoted her life to you, how much she 
cares about you?!  In her entire life, she never truly devoted herself 
to anything as much as she dedicated herself to you!  And to think I
stood up for you, risking expulsion from school, not to mention 
helping you get stronger!  How dare you spit on us like that!&#148;
	
He says nothing after that, his eyes turning to the ground and his lips
curled downward.  I release him from my grasp now, my arms pushing him 
forward so that he can fall to the floor.
	
&#147;...I said some hurtful things back there, didn&#146;t I?&#148; he asks after a 
moment of hesitation, his eyes still locked on the ground.  &#147;I...  I 
didn&#146;t mean...&#148;
	
&#147;Didn&#146;t you hear me earlier, I said get out!&#148; I repeat as loud as I 
can.  &#147;All of you, just get out!&#148;
	
Without saying another word, every begins to leave now.  I make sure 
to follow each of them as they leave my house, watching each of them 
leave the gates without looking back.  I slam the gate shut the moment 
they are all out of my line of vision, the metal bars making a loud
clang the moment it shuts.  I hurry inside the house now to check on 
Aya, hearing her sobs coming from inside.
	
I place my hand on the door, but something stops me from sliding the 
door open.  I want to go in there and console her, but there&#146;s another 
voice inside me that tells me not to.  It tells me to leave her alone 
for now, to let her sort out her emotions, the last thing she wants to 
do at the moment is talk about what happened.  Leave her alone the 
voice tells me, just leave her be.  I decide to go along with the voice
unfortunately, the claim being backed by the fact that I don&#146;t know 
what to say to her.  I take a seat on the wall next to her door, my 
arms wrapping around my legs and my eyes turning to the ground.
	
&#147;Why won&#146;t you go in there?&#148; my conscience asks me.
	
&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; I answer.
	
&#147;You two have been so distant since your brother died, so why do you 
only distance yourself further from her?&#148;
	
&#147;...I don&#146;t know.&#148;
	
&#147;Yes you do know.  You&#146;re afraid, afraid of getting close, you&#146;re 
afraid that everyone you grow close to will leave you behind.  Your 
parents, your brother, Mitsuomi, each of them were very dear to you, 
but each were also taken from you.  Are you afraid the same will happen
with Aya?  Is that why you can&#146;t admit your feelings to her?&#148;
	
&#147;No, I don&#146;t have feelings for her!&#148; I retort.  &#147;Not those kind of 
feelings.  It isn&#146;t right, I would never dream of doing anything like 
that with Aya.  I&#146;m sure she would also be disgusted by the idea.  
We&#146;re sisters, that&#146;s all we are and can ever be.&#148;
	
&#147;But you&#146;re afraid that you&#146;re relationship may become something else, 
you&#146;re afraid that if it were to go any further it may one day tear the
two of you apart.&#148;
	
&#147;...All right, I admit it, I am afraid!  I am afraid of growing close 
to her, I am afraid of admitting my feelings toward her, I am afraid 
that she may one day leave me, I am afraid...&#148;
	
&#147;Then why don&#146;t you do something about it?&#148;
	
&#147;I don&#146;t know...  I don&#146;t know...&#148;
	
The voice of conscience continues to echo in my head, its words 
beginning to drive me into tears of my own.  I don&#146;t know what I should
do, I know if I were to go in there right now I might risk our current 
relationship, that a simple word may destroy everything we&#146;ve developed
ever since we&#146;ve known each other.  But I don&#146;t want to see her like 
this, I can&#146;t bear to see her crying.  What should I do?  I don&#146;t know 
what to do...  Why?  Why can&#146;t I do anything?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


(Aya&#146;s POV)

	
I don&#146;t know how long I&#146;ve been crying, all I know is that the moon as 
taken the sun&#146;s place in the sky now.  My entire room is dimly lit with
the moonlight, the darkness reflecting my mood at the moment.  My 
cheeks are still wet with my tears, my voice strained from all my
sobbing, and my throat parched.  I notice a silhouette on the other 
side of my door now, a figure of a person sitting outside with their 
back against the door and their head sulking.  I immediately recognize 
who it is after seeing the shadow of two large antennae sticking out of
the hair.
	
&#147;Oneechan...?&#148; I open my door to find her sulking outside.
	
&#147;Aya...?&#148; she turns to me.  &#147;Are you...?&#148;
	
I find my body falling again, my arms quickly wrapping around my 
sister&#146;s waist.  I try to bury my face into her shoulder, my cries 
being muffled by the fabric of her shirt.  I feel her own arms wrapping
around me shortly, her hold gentle, yet firm.  She nestles her cheek 
with my own, wiping away some of the tears with the rubbing of her face
against mine.
	
&#147;Why, Oneechan?&#148; I ask her.  &#147;Why did I fall in love with someone like 
him?  I dedicated every fiber of my being to him, and yet...!&#148;
	
&#147;Sh, calm down,&#148; she tells me, &#147;it&#146;s okay.  You can&#146;t help with who you
fall in love with, you just...  It&#146;s like your under a spell, a spell 
that&#146;s difficult to break out of.  Your mind tells you that falling a 
certain person isn&#146;t right for whatever reason, but your heart still...
I&#146;m sorry, Aya, I&#146;m sorry you had to fall for someone like him.&#148;
	
&#147;He said I was hard to put up with,&#148; I continue, my voice nearly 
choking.  &#147;Am I really that difficult to deal with?  Am I really that 
obnoxious?  Tell me, Oneechan.  Am I really unfit to be his wife?  Am I
unfit to be anyone&#146;s wife?!&#148;
	
&#147;No, you&#146;re not,&#148; Oneechan assures me, cupping my face and bringing it 
before hers.  &#147;You&#146;re not hard to put with, you&#146;re not obnoxious.  It&#146;s
always a pleasure to have you around, it&#146;s always nice to see your face
beaming with a smile.  Your very presence, it&#146;s enough to life the 
moods of everyone in an entire room.  I&#146;m afraid that what I said 
doesn&#146;t apply to how that kid feels,&#148; she tells me, her voice showing a
hint of regret.  &#147;You may be unfit to be his wife, Aya, but that 
doesn&#146;t mean you&#146;re unfit to be another&#146;s wife.&#148;
	
&#147;Who then, Oneechan?&#148; I ask.  &#147;Who would I be suitable for?  If I were 
to fall in love, I would just go around telling everyone about my 
betrothed, even if he didn&#146;t love me back.  Who would be able to put up
with me, who would be able to eat my meals, appreciate me for being by
their side, who?  If Souichiro-sama isn&#146;t the one, then who else is 
there?&#148;
	
&#147;...there&#146;s me,&#148; my sister suddenly says.  &#147;There&#146;s me, Aya.&#148;
	
&#147;Onecha...?!&#148;
	
Her lips suddenly press against my own at this point, her mouth 
suppressing the rest of my words.  The skin of her lips is so soft, 
her breath tasting like peppermint, and her hair smelling like the 
morning dew.  My heart is beating as fast as a hummingbird&#146;s wings, my
stomach in knots, and my knees weak, I feel so vulnerable, yet so 
strong at the same time.  My eyes begin to close, a final tear falling 
down my cheek, this one falling not from sadness.  
	
Her own lips abruptly pull away from my own now, forcing me to open my 
own eyes.  I see a surprised look on her face, her hands quickly 
pulling away from my body as she stares into the floor with a brush of 
red painted over her face.  She sets her hands on her lap, her fingers
tightly grasping the material of her pants.  I feel my face burning as 
well as I stare at her like this, seeing her act so vulnerable.
	
&#147;I...I&#146;m sorry,&#148; Oneechan stutters, quickly making her way out of the 
room.
	
&#147;Oneechan, wait!&#148; I call her.
	
&#147;I...I didn&#146;t mean it,&#148; she stammers again.  &#147;I&#146;m so sorry, Aya.&#148;
	
&#147;Oneechan!&#148;
	
She leaves without saying anything after that, running through the hall
and into her bedroom.  I find my hand still reaching out to her despite
the fact that she has already left me.  The beating in my heart is as 
rapid as ever and my face still burning from the sensation of the kiss.
I bring my fingers to my lips now, finding the warmth of her mouth 
still pressing against my own.  My lips are curled, curled upward in a 
smile and my thoughts replaying the meeting of our lips.
	
What was that?  Why did Oneechan just kiss me?  Did she really mean all
those things she said?  Could it be that Oneechan is in love with me?  
My own sister, in love with me, is that even possible?  And why, why am
I happy over the fact that she kissed me?  Do I feel the same way?  
It&#146;s not right for sisters to love each other in such a manner, is that
why she ran away from me?  Am I in love with her, or am I just 
desperate after Souichiro-sama left me that I would go after the first 
person who cheered me up?
	
No, I&#146;m not desperate.  The beating of my heart, the lack of air in my 
lungs, the tingling throughout my entire body, I&#146;ve felt all of these 
things before.  When Oneechan complimented me, when she would stand up 
for me when we were children, when we were alone together, I always 
felt these things about her.  It was different for Oniichan, I never 
felt anything as exhilarating as how I did about Oneechan, despite how 
I was equally close with both of them.  And sometimes when I felt upset
and hugged a stuffed animal, it wasn&#146;t always Souichiro-sama I thought 
it about, sometimes it was her.  Yes, I must be in love with her, I 
must be in love with Oneechan.  My heart was never given to 
Souichiro-sama, I had already dedicated it to her, I had already 
dedicated to Oneechan.
	
&#147;Oneechan...,&#148; my fingers run down my lips once again, &#147;I love you...&#148;

Author&#146;s Note: Well there you have it.  Aya definitely knows how Maya 
feels about her now, but unfortunately Maya&#146;s still in denial despite 
knowing how she truly feels.  Yeah, Souichiro came off as a jerk after 
being beaten bu Isuzu, but we know he&#146;s got a bad attitude and takes it
really bad when he loses a fight.  Isuzu seemed out of character too, 
but the fact is that she hasn&#146;t taken Mitsuomi&#146;s death very well 
either, and the fact that Maya was with him on the night of his death
makes her feel even worse.  I hope you all enjoyed this chapter.  The 
next chapter takes place during the same day as the prologue, but it&#146;s 
the hours before it.  Well I hope you&#146;re all looking forward to it.
