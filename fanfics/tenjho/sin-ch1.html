<h1>Sin (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenjho/index.html">Tenjho Tenge</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbman.html">cbman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note:  Welcome to my first and probably only Tenjho Tenge 
fanfic, &quot;Sin.&quot;  Recently I&#39;ve become a fan of the Tenjho Tenge series,
and I was surprised to find no fan fiction for it (but then again, I 
didn&#39;t look too hard).  I&#39;ve seen the entire anime series fansubbed, 
including the OVAs, but I haven&#39;t read the original manga so this story
is based on the anime series (though I&#39;ve heard that there&#39;s little 
difference between the two) nor have I seen the official U.S.
release of the series.  This fic takes place shortly after the second 
OVA episode.  Like most of my fan fiction that I&#39;ve written recently, 
this story is shoujo-ai, but what sets this fic apart from my other 
shoujo-ai fics is the fact that this story deals greatly with the topic
of incest (in this case, the Natsume sisters, Aya and Maya).  So if 
stuff like that offends you, I strongly recommend you read something 
else.  Well that&#39;s about it for now, let&#39;s start the story.

                            

Prologue
                                

     
She sat there her with her entire body unmoving.  Her breath was short,
her throat parched, and her heart heavy.  Her entire being had been 
frozen at that moment, not paralyzed by the evening&#39;s breeze, but by 
the words spoken to her by her loved one.
     
&quot;Aya, do you want to make love to me?&quot; was what her lover said.
     
Aya did not know how to react after hearing these words, just the 
thought of having the one she had long adored finally say these words 
to her always painted her cheeks with a stroke of pink, and now, 
finally in reality, the one she loved had finally said it.  Her body 
began to tremble now, scared of the uncertainty of what her loved one 
would feel if she were to fail in carnal embrace.  It&#39;s true that the 
one before her had put her down in the past at times, had avoided her 
on numerous occasions, but it was not because they had thought ill of 
her, but because of their own insecurity.
     
&quot;Aya, if you don&#39;t want to, I understand,&quot; her lover began to speak 
again.  &quot;This is something that can never be undone.  After we&#39;ve made 
love, nothing will ever be the same again.  It&#39;s a really big step, one
that can forever change how we look at one another.  If you&#39;re happy 
with the way things are now between us, then we can just forget about 
what was brought up this night and...&quot;
     
&quot;No,&quot; Aya interrupted, placing her finger on the lips of her admirer.  
&quot;I am happy with the way things are right now, but I wish to go further
with you.  We&#39;ve been through so much in the time we&#39;ve known one 
another, but whenever we were together in the past, you never showed me
your self, your real self.  You always try to act so strong in front of
everyone, always full of pride, always taking charge, but behind that 
facade, I always saw a deep sadness that no one else noticed.  So 
please, if only for tonight, show me the real you.  I know it&#39;s selfish
of me to ask such a thing, but please, show me...&quot;
     
&quot;Aya...&quot;
     
Her palms began to clasp the face of her lover, the one she had adored 
for so long, the one who had showed her the path to true strength, and 
the one she had dedicated her body, mind, soul, and heart to.  Her lips
began to inch forward, quivering at the touch of her admirer&#39;s breath. 
The gap between their mouths was soon broken with the press of their 
lips, the skin of their mouths fitting perfectly against one another.  
A brush of warmth began to fill within her being, her entire body 
slowly melting with every passing second.  Her began sinking, her 
lover&#39;s body following her lead to the futon.  The moment her back met 
with the cotton surface, their lips began to part.  The chilly air 
began to separate the two again, but only for a second.  Another brush 
of their lips soon passed, this kiss deeper than the first.  Her entire
body began to burn now, the flames of passion swirling inside her.
     
Their lips parted once more, but this time they did not meet again.  
Another kiss had followed, this time it was on her neck.  It was 
followed by another, this one an inch below the one before, and then 
another followed.  More and more kisses fell upon her neck, each one 
adding more tinder to the inferno burning inside her.  Her arms began 
to take hold of her lover&#39;s shoulder in an attempt for her to catch her
breath.  Their eyes met during this brief recess, her reflection
shimmering brightly through the irises of the one she so greatly 
adored.  Aya gasped when their lips met with the base of her neck, her 
skin tenderly being pulled by the mouth of her lover.  She loved how 
they were tending to her; so soft, so gentle, her body was craving 
more.  Her hands began to run down the material on her body now, her 
fingers taking hold of the first round hook on her shirt.  The fabric 
began to peel away from the top, her fingers continuing to the next
button and the one after, freeing the two halves until there were no 
more.  Her lover had noticed this now, seeing the fair skin in the 
space between the gap of her clothing.
     
&quot;Are you sure, Aya?&quot; the question was raised once more.
     
&quot;Yes,&quot; she nodded, &quot;please, don&#39;t torment me any longer, Oneechan.&quot;
     
&quot;Please, don&#39;t call me that,&quot; her lover said.  &quot;Call me by name.  
Please, just say my name, Aya.&quot;
     
&quot;Maya, please, continue,&quot; she corrected herself.
     
For the first time she can remember, Natsume Maya&#39;s little sister had 
finally called her by her name.  In the past she was always known as 
&quot;Oneechan,&quot; not once did she ever call her &quot;Maya.&quot;  There were only two
who ever called her by her name, the only two men she had ever truly 
loved, her brother Shin and her former boyfriend Mitsuomi.  Both of 
them were dead now, and to finally hear someone she deeply cared for 
call her by her name once more brought a smile to her lips.  This smile
was not one she had to fake, not a mask to hide her true emotions, but 
a real smile she had not given for two years.
     
Not wanting to make her sister wait any longer, she continued as asked.
Her hands began to peel away the cotton material on her lover&#39;s body, 
freeing it so that she may say her sister&#39;s true form.  Her body was 
slender yet firm; there was not a scratch or scar on it despite how 
many  battles she had been in.  Her fair skin was ever so soft and 
delicate, rivaling the texture of clouds.  Maya began to run her hands 
inward now, brushing against her sister&#39;s chest.  Another gasp escaped 
Aya&#39;s lips, this one deeper than the last.  Just the sound of her voice
was enough to make the fire inside her burn brighter, but she knew how 
to make the inferno blaze even further.
     
Her lips began to travel up one of the globes her hand had taken hold 
of, slowly puckering at the sensitive skin.  Each kiss made her sister 
breath deeper, her voice nearly breaking into a shriek the moment she 
came to its peak.  The device within her mouth began to slide against 
it, slipping around its base as it made its way upward to the nipple.  
Her sister&#39;s voice grew louder and louder with every pass her tongue 
had made, her voice nearly echoing throughout their home with the last 
tap.
     
&quot;Maya...,&quot; her lover barely called her name.
     
&quot;Yes?&quot;
     
&quot;Let me try.&quot;
     
&quot;All right.&quot;
     
The two had rolled to the side, Maya&#39;s back now resting against the 
futon.  Insecurity began to run through Aya&#39;s mind once more; what her 
sister had done to intensify their passion was truly incredible, but 
what did Aya know about returning the favor?  She wasn&#39;t sure, perhaps
this wasn&#39;t a good idea after all.  Her lover&#39;s hand fell upon her face
shortly after, a smile greeting her as she turned to Maya&#39;s face.
     
&quot;Aya, it&#39;s okay,&quot; she assured her.  &quot;Do whatever you will with me as 
long as it brings you happiness.  As long as you&#39;re happy, then I&#39;ll be
happy.&quot;
     
Her sister&#39;s words caused her lips to stretch, her confidence 
immediately returning.  Her fingers quickly found themselves on her 
top, quickly removing the ribbon so that she may peel away the rest of 
the fabric.  She took little time to adore her sister&#39;s bare self, her 
lips immediately pressing against her sister&#39;s body.  It mattered not
where she placed her lips or how long she kept them pressed, she simply
wanted to taste the milk-hued surface of her body.

Something was wrong with this technique.  Though the traveling of her 
lips brought a smile to the younger one&#39;s face, it did nothing for the 
older one.  Aya slowly began to notice this, seeing the blank 
expression on her sister&#39;s face with the next three kisses.  The 
pressing of her lips had stopped at that moment, her body slowly 
peeling away from the older one&#39;s as her eyes turned the sheets of the 
futon.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Maya, I...&quot;

&quot;Slowly, Aya,&quot; the older one said, pulling her back to her body, 
&quot;slowly and gently.  Let me feel the warmth of your kisses, give the 
fires some time to burn.  Be patient, but not too patient.  Be soft,
yet fierce.&quot;
     
Taking her admirer&#39;s words into mind, she began to start over.  Her 
hands began to wrap around the mounds on her sister&#39;s chest, her hold 
firm but gentle.  They began to move outward, the motion creating a 
soft moan in her sister&#39;s lips.  The fire her sister had started began 
to burn again, but this simple movement was not going to do anything to
make the fire any stronger.  The younger sister decided to try and copy
the older one&#39;s technique, her tongue slowly painting one of her 
sister&#39;s nipples with the translucent fluid that covered it.  The 
result was the same, if not greater than her own reaction as another 
gasp had escaped her sister&#39;s lips.  Another layer soon followed, the
gasps growing louder as more layers followed.  Her tongue returned to 
her mouth after several more laps, her lips taking over the task.  A 
tiny pluck fell upon the pink nub, the slight pull causing it to swell 
a little.  Another pluck fell after, the swelling growing bigger.  A 
third, and then fourth, more and more followed until it could grow no 
more.  The inferno of passion was nearing its peak now as rivers began 
to escape the gaps between both of their legs.
     
Her sister&#39;s hand began to take hold of the remaining layers of 
clothing on their bodies, the fabrics that shielded their womanhood.  
Rivers of warmth followed the path of the materials, the source of the 
substance flowing more and more rapidly with every passing second.  
Maya&#39;s arms began to push against her sister&#39;s shoulders, bringing her 
sister&#39;s back to the futon once more.  Both of them were panting 
heavily now, their bodies nearly drenched, and their sexes barely able 
to contain the flooding any longer.  The older sister began to part the
younger one&#39;s legs, doing so with no resistance.  The gap between was
overflowing just as much as hers, just observing it made the floods 
flow even further.  Wasting little time she planted the source of the
flood atop one another.  A pair of soft moans escaped with the slight 
push that followed, another pair following shortly after with the next.
The pushes were slow at first with slight breaks in between, but each 
push that followed after was growing faster with a shorter break than 
the last.  Faster and faster they became, their moans growing louder 
and louder and the substance escaping their womanhood becoming more and
more rapid.
     
&quot;Maya, I can&#39;t hold it in much longer!&quot; the younger one said, her voice
crying above her sister&#39;s.
     
&quot;Together, Aya,&quot; the older one said, wrapping her arms tightly around 
the younger one, &quot;together!&quot;
     
&quot;MAYA!!!!!!!!&quot;
     
&quot;AYA!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
     
A blast warmth had brushed through the two sisters&#39; bodies at that 
very moment, that warmth surging through at the same time the forbidden
ambrosia escaped their sexes.  The substance flowed freely from their 
sources, each drop causing the flames of passion within both of them to
cool.  The entire atmosphere felt as if it was weighing down on both of
them, the cold air of the night seemed like it was pushing the two of 
them further into the futon.  Their bodies pressed against one another 
again, their faces pressing against each other.  With the remaining
strength in her body, Maya began to peel her body away from her 
sister&#39;s, the floods no longer escaping the gap in between either of 
their legs.  The events that had just occurred began to replay in
both of their minds, a smile stretched on both of their faces.
     
&quot;That was beautiful, Aya,&quot; Maya said, staring into her sister&#39;s 
cinnamon pupils once more.
     
&quot;Thank you, Maya,&quot; the younger sister returned the smile.
     
&quot;I love you, Aya.&quot;
     
&quot;And I love you, Maya.&quot;
     
Their lips met once more after, adding another small piece of tinder to
the dying flame inside each of them.  After parting lips once more, Aya
had turned her attention upward, her eyes surveying the ceiling.  Maya 
watched as her lover stared at the surface above them, the smile on
her face slowly melting as she saw the blank look on Aya&#39;s face.  
Concern immediately took over upon seeing this; Maya couldn&#39;t help but 
wonder what was going through Aya&#39;s mind at that moment.
     
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Maya asked.
     
&quot;I can&#39;t believe I just made love to my own sister,&quot; she answered.  
&quot;Don&#39;t misunderstand though, Maya,&quot; she assured her, her usual smile 
stretching across her face, &quot;I have no regrets about what just 
happened.&quot;
     
&quot;Then what&#39;s wrong?&quot;
     
&quot;Isn&#39;t it a sin to engage in actions like this with your own family?  
Is it not moral to sleep with your own sister even if your love 
transcends the barriers of flesh and blood?&quot;
     
&quot;...I suppose it is,&quot; Maya answered, &quot;but forbidden fruits are also 
the sweetest.&quot;  
     
&quot;Then...how do you think Souichiro-sama and the others will react when 
they find out about this?  Will they think we&#39;re terrible people?  Will
they look down on us for doing something so immoral?&quot;
     
&quot;Before you can ask that, you have to ask yourself what is truly moral 
and immoral.  We all have different views on different things; some may
think that disciplining students should strictly be a parent&#39;s job, 
others may think that the schools have a right to do so; some may think
sex should only be done after marriage while others think otherwise.  
These are but a few examples, Aya, so which is truly right?  None of 
them are right, do you know why?  Because the only one who can decide 
what is truly right and what is truly wrong is yourself, Aya.  I&#39;m not 
saying that you shouldn&#39;t listen to others around you, but I want you 
to do what you think is truly right regardless of what others&#39; opinions
are.&quot;
     
&quot;I understand,&quot; Aya nodded.  &quot;...Maya, do you remember how all of this 
started?&quot; Aya asked after, changing the subject.
     
&quot;What?&quot;
     
&quot;I asked you if you remember how this all started?&quot;
     
&quot;...yes I do,&quot; she answered after a slight moment of hesitation.  &quot;It 
was two weeks ago, at school, three days after...,&quot; she stopped, a lump
now in her throat.  &quot;Three days after Mitsuomi died...&quot;



Author&#39;s Note: Good so far I hope.  I know Mitsuomi didn&#39;t die in the 
anime, but the events that lead up to his death will be briefly 
explained in the next chapter.  As for Aya, I&#39;m sure we all know she&#39;s 
deeply in love with Souichiro in the anime series, so I&#39;m sure many of 
you are wondering why she&#39;s with Maya then.  I&#39;ll explain that in a 
later chapter because the following chapters (possibly at least the 
next four) will take place two weeks before the events of the prologue.
Also of note, the rest of the story will be told in First Person POV, 
told through different characters&#39; POV; not just Aya and Maya, but also
through the rest of the Jyuken Club&#39;s as they learn about the sisters&#39; 
new relationship.  In later chapters, you can expect to see a few 
fights, including a rematch between Maya and Isuzu.  I&#39;m aware that in
CMX&#39;s translation of the manga, Aya does call Maya by her name all the
time, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the case in the original manga.  But 
whatever, this is based on the fan-subbed version of the anime (I&#39;m not
sure what Aya calls Maya in the English Dub, but for the fic, we&#39;ll 
just go with &#39;Oneechan&#39; like the fan-subbed version).  One final note I
should make is that Maya will most likely be out of character in the 
following chapters due to the fact that Mitsuomi died.  Well, hope you 
all liked it so far, review if you like, but I hate flames.  Hope you 
continue to read this fic.</pre>
