<h1>Dust to Dust</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mosquiton/index.html">Master of Mosquiton</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hitomebore Inaho wasn&#39;t a happy girl. She wasn&#39;t happy 
even though she had been granted what she desired the most. She 
was now immortal. She was ageless. She was and would remain 
young forever.

And she was damn lonely.

She was lonely without her love. The person she had made 
herself immortal for... she was lonely without his company. 
Without the company of Mosquiton.

It was true that she had wanted to be immortal long before 
she had even known Mosquiton. But as they grew closer, as their 
bond grew and so did their love she found herself wanting 
immortality just to remain with him.

Now she was immortal and he was gone.

What was the point of it all? Part of Inaho thought that this 
had to be some sort of cruel cosmic joke. Maybe one set up by 
that crazy guy who had called her a monkey.

She missed him so much... she missed all of them. Even 
Hono and Yuki with how they were always referring to her as their 
&#39;Mama Inaho.&#39;

Gods how she wished she could hear them call her that 
now. And see the smile on Mosquiton&#39;s face while she ranted at 
them not to call her that because she was far too young to be 
having any children.

They had to come back to her. They just had to.

&quot;See? Now you wait for him, just as I have.&quot;

Jerking up out of her seat, Inaho whirled around, surprised 
at the sudden voice in her normally empty shop. They had lost 
almost all their business since she had made her return from the 
Moon without the others.

Her blue eyes widened at what she saw. And then they 
quickly narrowed as she hissed, &quot;Camille.&quot;

&quot;Hello dear,&quot; said Camille with a small smile. The vampire 
walked smoothly into the room and sat down in the chair across 
from Inaho in an elegant movement. &quot;So sad to see you alive and 
kicking. And immortal as well.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Inaho blinked. &quot;How do you...?&quot;

&quot;Instinct,&quot; Camille said as she gave a careless shrug. &quot;That 
and I know how annoyingly persistent you are about getting what 
you want. It was an easy guess.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; said Inaho slowly. &quot;What do you want?&quot; Her eyes 
narrowed again and she asked, &quot;And aren&#39;t you supposed to be 
dead? Not in your usual way but the dust to dust kind where 
nothing is left for burying?&quot;

&quot;Mmm, old news,&quot; said Camille lazily. She examined her 
gloved hands with smiling eyes and said in a low sort of purr, &quot;I 
have friends who fix things like that.&quot;

Snorting at this, Inaho said, &quot;Figures that getting rid of you 
wouldn&#39;t be that easy.&quot;

&quot;Easy?&quot; Camille quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Nearly a hundred 
years has passed since my &#39;death&#39; and it took all of that time for 
them to resurrect me once more. You call--&quot; She paused in her 
statement as her smile returned upon seeing the dry look on 
Inaho&#39;s features. &quot;Well done,&quot; she chuckled quietly. &quot;Getting used 
to immortality, are we?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Inaho shrugged. She rose to her feet and 
crossed over to record player and replaced the jazz record with 
another. &quot;It&#39;s not a lot to adjust to once you get used to the not 
aging and boredom part.&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; murmured Camille. &quot;Boredom. Such a tedious 
emotion but one well known to all immortals. Tell me,&quot; she said 
softly as she smiled once more and rested her chin on the tops of 
her hands. &quot;How are you dealing with it? With his absence from 
your life? Do you still wait for his return or have you lost all of your 
hope?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll return,&quot; said Inaho tightly, her blue eyes remaining 
focused on the record player. &quot;He promised.&quot;

Clenching her jaw, Camille hissed, &quot;He promised me the 
same thing, little girl. And do you see my husband at my side now? 
He won&#39;t return to you. If anything, you&#39;ll have to chase after him 
just like I did.&quot; Stopping to form a twisted sort of smile, Camille 
said, &quot;And won&#39;t it be funny when you find him in the arms of some 
young girl who has the fool idea of being immortal to be with him 
as well?&quot;

&quot;Be quiet,&quot; demanded Inaho harshly. Her hands were 
balled into fists and shaking at her side. She kept her back to 
Camille as her whole body trembled. &quot;That&#39;s not going to happen. 
Mosquiton will return to me.&quot;

Watching this reaction with a degree of surprise, Camille 
shook her head a bit and rose to her feet. &quot;You&#39;ve changed. I&#39;m 
surprised,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Somehow I was only expecting to find 
an older version of the brat that had caused me so much trouble in 
the past.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve changed,&quot; Inaho said in rough tones. She turned 
around to reveal pain filled blue eyes that tore into Camille&#39;s very 
soul. &quot;But you haven&#39;t. You&#39;re still being cruel for no reason.&quot; 
Pausing, Inaho shook her head and bore her eyes into the floor. 
&quot;Why do this? Why cause me this pain? We both understand what 
it&#39;s like... so why...?&quot;

&quot;Me? Cruel?!&quot; Camille exclaimed with an incredulous 
laugh. Grabbing Inaho&#39;s shoulders she gave the other woman a 
slight shake that caused Inaho to lift her gaze and meet their eyes. 
&quot;I&#39;m trying to save you the pain that I felt when Mosquiton didn&#39;t 
return to me.&quot; She closed her eyes painfully then whispered, &quot;He&#39;s 
not going to return to either of us, Inaho. We have to accept that.&quot;

&quot;No! He&#39;s coming back! He promised me!&quot; cried Inaho 
fiercely as she shook her head back and forth. In a crazed 
movement, she tried to break free of Camille&#39;s hold but the 
vampire held her tight. &quot;He&#39;ll return to me! He told me that he 
would!&quot; Tears streamed down her cheeks as she sobbed deep 
from her heart as Camille tenderly drew her close in an embrace. 
&quot;Mosquiton promised me...&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; whispered Camille lovingly, pressing Inaho&#39;s 
head into the crook her neck, her face resting into the fragrant red 
curls below her. &quot;He promised me too.&quot;

Crying the last of her tears, the last of her pain, the last of 
her love, Inaho lifted her head slowly and looked up into features 
that she never thought she&#39;d see so kind.

Slowly reaching her hand upwards, Inaho cupped 
Camille&#39;s cool and pale cheek in her hand. &quot;We know,&quot; she 
murmured in tones of acknowledgement. &quot;Both of us.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Camille replied softly, her voice shaking.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to be alone,&quot; said Inaho quietly.

&quot;Nor do I,&quot; replied Camille just as quietly.

&quot;Then,&quot; Inaho said bravely as she took in the breath of air 
she didn&#39;t know she&#39;d been holding. &quot;Lets be together.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Camille breathlessly as she nodded.

Their lips met in a timeless moment and in that instant the 
world seemed to stand still. Their hearts felt free and their souls felt 
unburdened.

But then the moment and the kiss ended.

Foreheads resting against one another, they met their eyes 
and smiled softly. Inaho reached out to hold a strand of Camille&#39;s 
black hair in her fingers then asked in the softest of tones, &quot;Should 
we keep waiting for him?&quot;

Closing her eyes in a slow movement, Camille sighed then 
murmured, &quot;We wait by keeping him in our hearts always but we 
wait only in that way.&quot; Opening her eyes, she locked her gaze with 
Inaho&#39;s. &quot;Immortal lives should be led living. Not wasted away 
waiting.&quot;

Inaho&#39;s only reply was a silent nod of her head.

They agreed. Their lives were for living, not for waiting. 
And their lives were their own, not his property.

Funny, isn&#39;t it? Both of them owned him at one time. Told 
Mosquiton what to do... and he was loyal to him through their 
bond. But somehow, they both found that it was really he who 
owned them.

And he owned them body and soul.

But now they were finally free. And he was finally gone. 
Turned to dust in their lives and their hearts.

It was the worst death for any vampire.

-End-


The characters of Inaho and Camille are from Master of 
Mosquiton. I don&#39;t know where this fic came from but it&#39;s still a 
rather nice one I think. Sad, but nice. Even I can&#39;t quite picture 
these two as a couple but still... hmm.

&quot;Though I try to hide it, it&#39;s clear. My world crumbles when you&#39;re 
not near.&quot;
