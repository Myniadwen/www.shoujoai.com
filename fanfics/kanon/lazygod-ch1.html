<pre>&quot;No, not that way! Your house is west of here!&quot;

The streets were usually quiet after dark, due to being just outside
the main city. Few cars passed the two women that were walking home.

&quot;Oh... that&#39;s right...&quot; Mumbled Nayuki, as she turned around.

&quot;You&#39;re the one who wanted to go home, remember?&quot; Stated Kaori.

The two were at a friend&#39;s house celebrating the end of the schoolyear.
They were enjoying themselves for a while, untill Kaori noticed that
Nayuki was starting to get irritable. Worried that she might snap at
the next person she talked to, Kaori decided to walk her home.

&quot;But i&#39;m really tired&quot; Nayuki replied, brushing her long blue hair away
from her face.

Kaori smiled, even though she found her friend&#39;s whining mildly
annoying. &quot;It&#39;s only ten. We still have a few hours before your mother
asked you to come home.&quot;

&quot;I know, but i&#39;m usually in bed by now...&quot;

Kaori giggled quietly, as this was typical of Nayuki. &quot;You need to
start taking vitamins...&quot;

Nayuki started to walk off path again, straying out into the road.

&quot;No! Over here!&quot; Kaori shouted. &quot;Honestly, do I have to hold your
hand untill we get there?&quot;

&quot;Would you?&quot; Nayuki didn&#39;t realize she was only joking.

It didn&#39;t matter, they would be wandering around all night if the
brunette wouldn&#39;t help. She grabbed the other girl by the hand and
pulled her back on to the sidewalk. Kaori was glad she didn&#39;t mention
anything about carrying her, as she dragged Nayuki behind her.

They arrived at Nayuki&#39;s house after a few minutes.

&quot;Welcome back, did you two have fun?&quot; Akiko greeted them as they
entered the living room.

&quot;Mmmmm...&quot; Was Nayuki&#39;s response, which her mother took as a yes.

&quot;We had a great time.&quot; Kaori added, knowing she was the only one
capable of answering questions about the evening. &quot;Would it be okay
if I stay here tonight?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Said Akiko. &quot;I&#39;ll call your parents and tell them your
sleeping over.&quot;

As the older woman left to use the phone, Kaori dragged her friend
upstairs, but stopped before they got to her bedroom.

&quot;No, you&#39;re brushing your teeth first.&quot; Said Kaori as she pointed
to the bathroom, drawing a whine from the cranky girl. &quot;And i&#39;m
going to watch to make sure you do it properly. No cavities for you.&quot;

&quot;Meanie!&quot; Pouted Nayuki, adding to her friend&#39;s amusement.

Once they were finished, they went to the bedroom. Nayuki undressed
and crawled into bed, wrapping her arms around a large frog plushie.
Kaori took a few minutes to change into a nightshirt and lay down
opposite of her friend, who was already asleep.

Both girls slept peacefully through the night. As morning came
sunlight filtered in through the curtains. Kaori began to wake up
as she felt something strange.

&quot;So warm... soft. And... moving?&quot;

As she opened her eyes, Kaori realized that Nayuki had her arms
wrapped securely around her.

Keropi, the plushie Nayuki always slept with had fallen off the
bed during the night. Having nothing to cuddle with, the young
woman would usually grab the closest thing to her. Last night,
it happened to be Kaori.

Trying to get up was a challenge with someone on top of her, but
she managed to slide out of bed with some effort.

As Kaori stood up, she heard a soft moan come from Nayuki, who
seemed to be reaching for something in the now empty bed. Small
tears formed in her eyes as she lay there.

Kaori walked over to where keropi was sitting and picked it up.
She placed it gently against Nayuki, who sighed in relief.

&quot;You&#39;re such a baby...&quot;

Kaori found the sight of Nayuki curled around her plushie nearly
overwhelming. &quot;I should have brought my camera.&quot; she thought,
leaning in closer to the sleeping girl. Closing her eyes, she
kissed her gently on the cheek.

The couple remained still for a moment, untill Kaori realized what
she was doing and pulled away.

&quot;What if she were to wake up and see this... she would be furious...&quot;
Thought Kaori, shaking nervously. &quot;There&#39;s no way I could explain
this.&quot;

The thought of how her friend might react was enough to return Kaori&#39;s
inhibitions. After grabbing her clothes, she left the bedroom. Closing
the door queitly to avoid waking anyone she went to use the shower.

The warm water pouring over her was calming, after a few minutes she
felt there was nothing to worry about.

&quot;I just kissed her because i&#39;m her best friend...&quot; Kaori reasoned
&quot;There&#39;s no need for me to bring this up, she wouldn&#39;t want to hear
about it anyway.&quot;

After convincing herself that everything was fine, the young woman
dried off and got dressed.

As she left the shower, Kaori saw Nayuki leave her room and walk up
to her.

&quot;Where&#39;s Akiko?&quot; asked Kaori.

&quot;At work, we&#39;re the only ones home right now.&quot; Said Nayuki &quot;I need
to use the bathroom, so go ahead and fix yourself something for
breakfast.&quot;

&quot;Okay, i&#39;ll make yours too. It should be ready when you&#39;re done.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you!&quot; Nayuki said. She then entered the bathroom and closed
the door.

Downstairs in the kitchen, the scent of pancakes filled the room as
Kaori set two plates on the table. She finished just as Nayuki walked
in the room. The two girls sat at the table across from each other.

Before they started eating, Nayuki looked up at her friend and asked
&quot;Kaori, do you like me?&quot;

Kaori replied immediately. &quot;Of course I do, silly.&quot; They had been best
friends for years, so there was no need to ask as far as she was
concerned.

&quot;Enough to kiss me?&quot; Nayuki continued, looking her friend straight in
the eyes.

This was the last thing she wanted to hear at the moment. &quot;Ha ha, you
wish.&quot; Kaori said, sticking her toung out coyly.

Nayuki didn&#39;t seem to find the conversation very funny, her face
carried a look of concern. &quot;But you did.&quot; She stated matter of factly.

&quot;When?&quot; Kaori almost squirmed as she felt a cold drop of sweat roll
down her back.

&quot;This morning, when I was asleep.&quot; Answered Nayuki.

Kaori smiled as her confidence improved slightly. This was a good
chance to avoid further questioning. She did not know what would make
Nayuki think she had kissed her, but was positive that she would not
be able to notice it while asleep.

&quot;It must have been a dream. After all, you&#39;ve slept through earthquakes
before, and it takes at least seven alarm clocks just to wake you up.&quot;

Nayuki remained silent for a few seconds, causing the other woman to
sigh in relief and assume the topic was finished. She took a sip from
her glass and set it down before continuing.

&quot;You obviously forgot you were wearing lipstick last night.&quot; Nayuki
said, watching her friend&#39;s face turn pale. &quot;I usually don&#39;t wake up
with another woman&#39;s lipmarks on my cheek.&quot;

Stunned, Kaori was unable to respond. Her silence, as well as the look
of horror on her face was enough to show that she was lying.

&quot;It was faint, but I still noticed it when I looked in the mirror
earlier.&quot;

&quot;Come on now, it must have been your mother kissing you goodnight. 
he does that sometimes, right?&quot; Kaori pleaded, her voice taking on
a tone of desperation.

&quot;Yeah, but mama doesn&#39;t have any hotpink shades of lipstick.&quot;

&quot;She could have went shopping yesterday, we were awfully late getting
home!&quot; Nayuki found this to be laughable as she had watched her friend
apply the cosmetic just before leaving for the party the other day.
She even commented about it, saying that it looked good on her.

&quot;Just give up, it&#39;s not like i&#39;m mad at you.&quot; Said Nayuki. She wanted
to make this easier on her friend, who looked as if she were about to
start crying, before the discussion could degenerate into a fight.

&quot;Nayuki... i&#39;m so sorry, i just...&quot; said Kaori, before being
interrupted.

&quot;No, it&#39;s okay. You don&#39;t need to apoligize&quot; Said Nayuki. &quot;I was just
curious.&quot;

&quot;Well... you looked so lonely when I got up.&quot; Said Kaori.

&quot;So you were worried about me, is that it?&quot; Nayuki said, smiling
innocently at her friend.

Kaori hesitated for a moment &quot;No, I did it out of adoration.&quot;

Nayuki was suprised to hear this, although she certainly had no
objection to being loved. &quot;I see... if thats how it is then i&#39;m
honored.&quot; Deciding to leave the discussion at that, she lifted her
fork and began eating.

Kaori was greatly relieved to hear this, as she was feeling too
vulnerable to endure any negative remarks. The two finished
breakfast without further incident and cleared the table.

In the living room Nayuki sat on the couch and turned the
television to the news. 

&quot;There are some new movies playing at the mall, do you want to see
one later?&quot; Asked the brunette as she sat next to her.

&quot;Sure, you owe me a date anyway.&quot; Nayuki said playfully.

Kaori leered warily in return. &quot;You said you weren&#39;t mad at me for
that kiss.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not mad about that. I&#39;m upset that you tried to hide it from
me.&quot; Said Nayuki, failing to hide her smirk.

&quot;That&#39;s not fair.&quot; Kaori pouted in mock offense, as the other
erupted in laughter.</pre>
