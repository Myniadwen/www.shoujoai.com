<h1>A Single Valentine</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kanon/index.html">Kanon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>        Waai! ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ I finally wrote a Kanon fic! ^^ This is a 
short little SayurixMai fic I wrote for Valentine&#39;s Day, based on the 
anime series. ^^ I think they were a pretty obvious couple in the 
series, even if they didn&#39;t actually get together. It was Mai&#39;s line in 
episode 8 that got me: &quot;I like Yuuichi. And I really like Sayuri&quot;. 
^_________^
        *ahem* Anyway...this was also written for the Muteiko 
Valentine&#146;s Day Fic Challenge issued by Amychan. XD

------------------------------------------------------------

It&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day.

All around me, people are exchanging cards, gifts, and smiles. Couples 
are kissing, girls are squealing their hope that the boy they like sent 
them a card or a flower. Everyone&#39;s gotten at least one Valentine from 
someone.

Except me.

Nobody ever sends me Valentines. They don&#39;t even talk to me. Even after 
the rumors circulating about me have died down, they still ignore me.

But I don&#39;t care. I&#39;ve always been a loner, and I&#39;m content to stay that 
way. I don&#39;t care if people think I&#39;m a freak, or spread rumors about 
me. I don&#39;t need anyone.

Besides, it&#39;s too dangerous to get involved with a demon slayer. I don&#39;t 
want to risk an innocent person being hurt because of me.

Especially her.

I guess I&#39;m not a complete loner. I have one friend. But she&#39;s so 
popular...why would she jeopardize her good reputation by spending time 
with me? Or risk being hurt by a demon that comes after me?

I&#39;m better off being alone.

Even in the rare moments where I do wish someone would give me a 
Valentine, I know it isn&#39;t going to happen. Why wish for something that 
isn&#39;t going to come true?

I don&#39;t care about getting Valentines anyway.

&quot;Mai?&quot;

A voice snaps me out of my thoughts. I turn my head to see her standing 
next to my desk, smiling and holding a red envelope in her hand.

&quot;Sayuri.&quot;

&quot;Here...I wanted to save yours for last,&quot; she says, handing me the 
envelope. I blink, staring at it for a few moments.

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to do this, Sayuri,&quot; I say. She just smiles.

&quot;I want to. You are my best friend, after all,&quot; she says. I carefully 
open the envelope and pull out the card. It&#39;s beautiful-a simple white 
card with a rose printed on the front. I open the card and read Sayuri&#39;s 
handwriting.

&#39;Mai-

Sayuri believes in you, no matter what. Remember, you don&#39;t always have 
to solve everything on your own. 

And I know what you&#39;re thinking. I&#39;d rather be with Mai on Valentine&#39;s 
Day than anyone else.

Love, Sayuri&#39;

My cheeks are warm as I look back up at Sayuri. Her smile is wider, and 
she&#39;s blushing slightly as well.

For the first time in what seems like forever, I smile.

&quot;Sayuri...&quot; I hold the card to my chest. A strange feeling is coming 
over me...I feel almost like I&#39;m going to cry, but not from sadness.

&quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day, Mai,&quot; Sayuri says softly, placing her hand 
against mine.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; I whisper. As I stand up, she pulls me into a hug. Still 
holding the card tightly in my hand, I return it, closing my eyes. The 
chatter of others continues all around me, but I don&#39;t notice.

&quot;Sayuri doesn&#39;t want Mai to be alone on Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; she says. We 
slowly pull back from our embrace, and I gaze into her shining burgundy 
eyes.

&quot;I...don&#39;t have anything for you,&quot; I say, feeling a bit guilty.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. My present was to see your smile,&quot; she says. The bell rings 
just then, so we gather our schoolbags and walk outside.

&quot;I still want to give you something.&quot; Just then, I see a few small 
purple flowers growing in a patch of ground not covered by snow. I pick 
one, then press it into her hand. &quot;Here...&quot;

&quot;Mai...&quot; She blushes.

&quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day, Sayuri,&quot; I whisper. She places the flower in her 
front pocket, then takes my hand.

&quot;Thank you, Mai.&quot;

As we walk home, a light snow begins to fall. A peaceful silence falls 
over us.

Sayuri&#39;s Valentine was the only one I received. And for that, I am glad.

------------------------------------------------------------

        Yay! ^_^ About time I wrote a new shoujo ai fic! ^-^ Sayuri&amp;Mai 
were really cute in the anime. ^^ I actually didn&#39;t expect to FINISH 
this in one day...well, maybe a little. ^_^; The old &quot;when ya really put 
your mind to it&quot; stuff, I guess. ^_^
        I plan to write more Kanon fics in the future. Pairings I have 
in mind are Nayuki/Kaori (They&#39;re pretty close, and I can see Nayuki 
needing a shoulder to cry on after what happens in episode 11), 
Nayuki/Ayu (I admit it, all the promo art of those 2 made me think! 
^^;), Nayuki/Shiori (Hey, why not?), Mishio/Makoto (Though it&#39;d be 
tragic cause of episode 10. ;_;), and Yuuichi/Kitagawa (Hey, Kitagawa 
seemed to like Yuuichi a lot! XD It&#39;s possible!). And Sayuri/Mai, of 
course. The subtext in the anime is a lot of fun to play with. ^^</pre>
