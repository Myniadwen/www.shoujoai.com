<h1>Ever After (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yamiboushi/index.html">Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito</a>

<a href="../yamiboushi/everafter-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Now where are we?&quot; Hazuki asked as they looked around
them, both a bit disoriented after traveling to
another world. The black haired young woman held her
katana at her side, her eyes sweeping their
surroundings warily. Together they had embarked on
another quest to find Eve, and this time it seemed
their journey was even stranger.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Lilith admitted as the bosomy blonde
adjusted her costume, the odd eyeball hat she wore
gazing about curiously. This was the sixth world they
had traveled to together, both facing jeopardy as they
quested for traces of Eve.

There was an ominous sense of doom around the place,
an oppressive feeling surrounding them, pressing down
like a deathly chill. The city they had landed in
looked like it had been through a brutal war, all the
buildings as far as the eye could see shattered and
broken and the streets deserted of people or any sign
of life. Off in the distance a low moaning sound could
be heard, something like the howls of the dead.

From around a corner they came, shambling forward,
eyes empty of reason as the gray faced men charged
forward at them. Their clothes were rags over bodies
that seemed to be rotting away, their teeth still
gleaming amid all the decay.

&quot;Behind me,&quot; Hazuki ordered Lilith as she drew her
blade, swinging to cut through the rotting undead with
ridiculous ease, the shining blade sending them
screaming away.

&quot;Vampires,&quot; Lilith blurted.

&quot;I thought they were a myth,&quot; Hazuki answered as she
cut another of the shambling horde, being careful to
stay clear of their grip.

&quot;In most books they are,&quot; Lilith said as she popped
open her blouse, rummaging about past the swell of her
breasts, &quot;but in this one they&#39;re real.&quot;

&quot;What are you...?&quot; Hazuki asked, blushing faintly.

&quot;Ah ha,&quot; Lilith pulled a small box of matches out.
Lighting a match she held it above her head... where
it exploded into pure sunlight, sending the undead
scrambling backward.

Then a gun roared out, and the running vampires were
swiftly cut down by twin weapons, cannons reducing the
surviving numbers to ash and ruin. &quot;There&#39;s someone
else out there,&quot; Hazuki kept her sword drawn at her
side.

The two emerged from the shadows, walking forward
calmly. The blonde haired young woman was dressed in a
military style uniform while her companion wore a
stylish red suit, the cloth hugging her shapely form.
Both had the most eerie looking eyes, the color of
blood.

&quot;My name is Seres Victoria,&quot; the little blonde said.

The woman in red pushed her circular hat up, revealing
pure white hair tied back by a leather band beneath
it, &quot;And I&#39;m Integra Hellsing. What are you doing in
London? Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s controlled by the
vampires?&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you vampires?&quot; Lilith asked pointedly.

&quot;Not by our choice,&quot; Integra bit out the words with
obvious resentment, &quot;and we do not feed on.. living
humans.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re here looking for a lost friend,&quot; Hazuki said,
holding her weapon at the ready, &quot;we don&#39;t want
trouble.&quot;

&quot;Though we always seem to find it,&quot; Lilith muttered.

&quot;Hush,&quot; Hazuki fought a slight smile.

&quot;If your friend was in London when Lord Alucard took
over, they&#39;re dead, wish they were dead or turned into
his ghouls,&quot; Seres said quietly, &quot;now leave here for
your own safety. If you can get out of town before
Alucard realizes his ghouls were destroyed you might
make it.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Lilith shook her head, &quot;we know she&#39;s somewhere
nearby here.

&quot;Fool,&quot; Seres drew her pistol...

...when Hazuki struck like the wind, her silvery sword
cleaving the weapon in half and sending the pieces
clattering to the broken cement beneath their feet.
&quot;Don&#39;t try to threaten Lilith,&quot; she said to her
flatly, &quot;or answer to me.&quot;

Integra reached out to stop Seres from moving on both
woman as she studied them thoughtfully. &quot;There&#39;s a
place we&#39;re gathering to fight,&quot; she said calmly,
&quot;your friend might be there. Follow if you choose.&quot;

With that they turned and strode off. &quot;That was my
favorite pistol, why did you stop me?&quot; Seres
complained softly.

Integra checked to see if the two were following as
she said, &quot;There&#39;s something unusual about them...
they could be useful.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Lilith said to Hazuki softly as they fell
into step behind Seres and Integra, keeping a wary eye
out for more of the undead.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Hazuki answered quietly. She looked
up, gazing across the city at the broken clocktower
that loomed against the cloudless sky, &quot;That looks
like photos of Big Ben, but I can barely believe we&#39;re
in London...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never been there,&quot; Lilith admitted, &quot;but it&#39;s
possible.&quot;

Moving a bit closer to Integra and Seres she
tentatively asked the two of them, &quot;How could this
have happened?&quot;

&quot;Because of my failure,&quot; Integra said flatly.

&quot;Lady Hellsing, it wasn&#39;t...&quot; Seres started.

&quot;I trusted Alucard,&quot; Integra cut her off, &quot;even
knowing what he once was. When the Nazi&#39;s attacked
London I chose to let him turn our fallen to ghouls,
to aid in the defense, as well as to stop those damn
Catholics.&quot;

&quot;What happened then?&quot; Lilith asked eagerly, sounding
almost like a little girl listening to an exciting
story.

&quot;Alucard succeeded in defeating the leader of the
Nazi&#39;s and then consumed his essence,&quot; Seres revealed
grimly, &quot;and in the process broke free of the mystical
bonds that had held him under Hellsing&#39;s control. He
turned the army of ghouls on us, as well as taking the
Nazi army for his own... we never had a chance.&quot;

&quot;But you two are vampires,&quot; Hazuki studied them warily
as they reached a larger building and began to pick
their way through the rubble, &quot;why doesn&#39;t Alucard
control you?&quot;

&quot;I was made by a punk vampire just before Alucard
killed him on a Hellsing operation,&quot; Seres revealed,
&quot;apparently Alucard felt that Hellsing could use me.&quot;

&quot;And after Alucard tore me open in revenge for
controlling him for so long,&quot; Integra said, &quot;Seres
turned me.&quot;

&quot;Get in,&quot; Seres pulled open a hatch in the floor,
revealing tunnels beneath.

&quot;Hazuki?&quot; Lilith hesitated.

Reaching out Hazuki took Lilith&#39;s hand and squeezed
comfortingly. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; and together they descended
into semi-darkness.

They walked down a long hall lit by torches,
eventually coming up to a door guarded by a man
dressed in formal wear. He bowed, the balding man&#39;s
motion revealing that the sleeve of his shirt was
empty, his one arm was gone, &quot;Welcome back Lady
Hellsing.&quot;

&quot;Walter,&quot; Integra smiled, &quot;how is everyone holding
up?&quot;

&quot;Tense,&quot; Walter summarized, &quot;but we&#39;re holding up
well.&quot; He looked curiously at the others and asked,
&quot;Newcomers?&quot;

&quot;Yes, they were dealing with a band of ghouls before
we found them,&quot; Seres revealed with a impish smile.

&quot;They can fight? Then welcome,&quot; Walter nodded to
Hazuki and Lilith, &quot;to the Royal Order of Holy
Knights.&quot;

&quot;Or what&#39;s left of us,&quot; Integra added bleakly as the
door opened and they headed inside.

The room was surprisingly brightly lit, so much so
that Integra whipped out a set of round sunglasses and
put them on. There were maps on the walls, blueprints,
and several radios of different types. People rushed
about with papers and personal computers, sorting and
gathering data, even as they could see into nearby
rooms where soldiers and others talked.

&quot;We&#39;ve confirmed that Alucard has moved into the
Palace,&quot; one young man reported, &quot;we&#39;ve got the plans
from the National Archives and are looking into routes
inside.&quot;

&quot;Very good,&quot; Integra nodded briskly with confidence.

Seres snagged another officer, &quot;Any news on the
Royals?&quot;

&quot;Prince Harry was the last to go,&quot; he shook his head
regretfully, &quot;Alucard has made a clean sweep of the
Royals.&quot;

&quot;Not unexpected,&quot; Integra kept her voice even, &quot;we may
have to look to a foreign branch of the family to
reestablish the Monarchy.&quot;

&quot;Do you really think they can?&quot; Lilith asked Hazuki
softly.

&quot;I think,&quot; Hazuki answered softly so that none of the
others could hear, &quot;even if they can&#39;t win she has to
act like she believes she can.&quot;

A third young man spoke up, &quot;We&#39;ve got photos of
Alucard&#39;s latest brides.&quot;

&quot;Is there anyone important?&quot; Seres asked briskly as
they crowded around the table to look at the photos.

&quot;Several actresses and singers,&quot; he shrugged as he
gestured to them, &quot;and a few unknowns.&quot;

Hazuki peered over a shoulder in morbid curiosity only
to gasp. &quot;Let me through,&quot; she elbowed a trooper aside
and snatched up the photo of a familiar girl with a
sweet smile, her forehead visible through her bangs.
&quot;Hatsumi,&quot; she said weakly.

&quot;Eve,&quot; Lilith confirmed.

&quot;That&#39;s your lost friend?&quot; Integra looked at them with
surprising sympathy as she said, &quot;She&#39;s as good as
dead.&quot;

&quot;Not if I can help it,&quot; Hazuki said flatly. She looked
over at Lilith, &quot;Looks like we&#39;ll be paying Lord
Alucard a visit.&quot;

&quot;Eve always picks the most exciting places to play,&quot;
Lilith said with a sigh.</pre>
