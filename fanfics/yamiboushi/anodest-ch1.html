<pre>Hazuki looked down at Hatsumi with an anguished expression on her face, 
the lovely blonde looking up at her with kindness and a bit of pain. 
&quot;Please,&quot; the tall, black haired woman said softly, &quot;I just want to be 
with you once again.&quot;

Hatsumi shook her head no sadly as she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... I can&#39;t.&quot; She 
reached up, laying a hand caressingly against Hazuki&#39;s cheek as she said 
to her tearfully, &quot;If there was any way I could I would, but my destiny 
lies elsewhere.&quot;

Hazuki turned her head, savoring that gentle touch on her cheek. &quot;I 
could learn to hate destiny,&quot; she said, her voice choked.

&#39;It&#39;s too cruel,&#39; Hatsumi thought to herself, gazing into Hazuki&#39;s 
anguished eyes. &quot;I can&#39;t be with you,&quot; she finally said softly, &quot;but 
there are those who you&#39;ve met in your travels... I could, if you 
choose, send you back to one of them.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Hazuki said, holding on to Hatsumi&#39;s hand.

&quot;In your journey across the worlds you have lingered in the hearts and 
minds of those you met,&quot; Hatsumi quietly explained, &quot;Quill, Princess 
Fuji and many others. More than one would long to see you once again.&quot;

&quot;I want to be with you,&quot; Hazuki shook her head.

&quot;There was one who touched you heart,&quot; Hatsumi said to her perceptively, 
&quot;I know it.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Hazuki looked away from her with a blush, remembering a bit 
guiltily an old fashioned room, how her head was held in another&#39;s lap 
as exhaustion and pain were soothed away for a time under her gentle 
touch.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Hatsumi&#39;s eyes brightened slightly, almost as if she could read 
Hazuki&#39;s mind. She stood a bit closer then moved to kiss her gently on 
the lips as she murmured softly, &quot;I will always love you, Hazumi.&quot;

&quot;Wait...&quot; Hazuki cried out then Hatsumi began to glow, green light 
washing out the world of garden&#39;s around her. The image of Hatsumi 
lingered, looking both utterly human and purely divine, then Hazuki felt 
the familiar sensation of worlds shifting.

----------

It was a different era in Japanese history, a place where things were 
settled by violence and the sword as much as by calm words. The things 
that mattered here were loyalty, strength and duty, in the hearts of 
both the warriors and the ones that they served.

The black haired figure strode down the road confidently, the white 
traveling coat of a samurai flapping in the breeze, a bag carried over 
her shoulder, her baggy black leggings flowing as her sandals clomped 
against the rough road. The woman looked like a part of this world, 
almost like she had stepped out of a samurai story, but looks were 
deceiving.

Hazuki kept a wary eye out as she walked up into the hills, her one hand 
resting comfortably on the hilt of her sword. Bandits had attacked her 
not long after she first arrived a few days ago, though it had turned 
out to be a piece of good fortune. In the booty that she had recovered 
from the crooks had been this garb, and once she washed them a few times 
in a icy mountain stream they were remarkably comfortable.

&#39;I&#39;m glad I did that cosplay for a samurai once, or I wouldn&#39;t have 
known how to wear this,&#39; Hazuki mused. &#39;Let&#39;s see,&#39; she thought as she 
stood near the forest, &#39;I met the nine tailed fox girl here, so I need 
to go this way.&#39; She turned on the road...

&quot;Help me!&quot; the familiar voice cried out.

Without a thought Hazuki was off, racing towards the sound of the voice. 
The trees parted to reveal a clearing, several masked figures menacing 
another young woman. Hazuki instantly recognized the band of ninja women 
that she had fought here the last time, when they had attempted to take 
away Princess Fuji&#39;s magic comb.

&quot;We know that you serve the Princess Fuji,&quot; the blonde leader of the 
ninjas said to the figure they surrounded, blocking her from Hazuki&#39;s 
sight, the woman holding her blade threateningly as the others stood in 
a half circle, &quot;if you don&#39;t help us get the treasure we seek, you and 
all of your family will suffer most dearly.&quot;

&#39;Damn them,&#39; Hazuki thought with a burst of fury, racing out from cover 
to leap into battle. The first ninja barely had a chance to react as she 
cut her down, turning to swing at another as the ninja scattered in 
alarm.

&quot;You!&quot; the ninja leader cried out in alarm as she drew her sword, her 
bikini like garb barely holding back her assets.

Hazuki met the first strike, her sword blazing with it&#39;s unearthly fire, 
then swept her back with a viscous strike. The ninja clearly weren&#39;t 
prepared for battle, striking wildly and disorganized, and Hazuki was 
able to defeat two more before they could recover.

&quot;Threatening a girl?&quot; Hazumi said coldly as they gathered a little ways 
away from her, &quot;You&#39;re beneath contempt.&quot;

The leader of the ninja studied her warily, &quot;We&#39;ll finish this later.&quot; 
With that she and the others seemed to disappear, fading into the woods 
around them.

&quot;Big sis!&quot; the happy voice squealed, running in a circle around her 
before looking up at Hazuki in surprise.

&quot;Spiritual fox?&quot; Hazuki blinked, recognizing the orange haired fox-girl 
instantly.

&quot;Yes!&quot; she beamed. the fox girl looking her over. &quot;What happened to the 
odd clothes you had?&quot; she asked.

Hazuki simply nodded to her bag, &quot;So you now work for Princess Fuji?&quot;

&quot;Yes I do,&quot; the fox girl nodded as they walked up the path, &quot;she took me 
in not long after I arrived.&quot; A smirk, &quot;Over the objections of her 
samurai.&quot;

Hazuki fought back a laugh, remembering how annoyed the fox had made the 
samurai. &quot;How long have you been there?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Nearly three months,&quot; the fox admitted, &quot;since I left the garden 
world.&quot;

&quot;Three months?&quot; Hazuki looked down at her in surprise as she said, &quot;But 
it&#39;s been less than a week for me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just glad your back,&quot; fox answered with a smile, &quot;Princess Fuji has 
missed you.&quot;

The older samurai stood by the gate, sternly talking to the two guards 
there when they saw a flicker of movement up the trail. He turned, the 
metal of his eye-patch shining then called out, &quot;Who goes there?&quot; Beside 
him the others drew their swords with a steely hiss.

Hazuki put her hand on her sword but she kept her voice calm. &quot;Do you 
really want me to disarm you all again?&quot; she asked mildly.

He looked at her in surprise then blurted, &quot;Lady Hazuki?&quot;

&quot;Lady?&quot; Hazuki managed to get out before the older man clasped her in a 
firm hug, the other samurai looking on in awe.

&quot;Princess Fuji called you that,&quot; he almost sounded fatherly, &quot;and so do 
we all.&quot;

Hazuki pulled back, meeting his eye as she asked, &quot;How is the Princess?&quot;

&quot;Well enough,&quot; he said, &quot;but she misses you, I think more than she 
expected.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Hazuki admitted, &quot;may I...?&quot;

He smiled as the guards swiftly moved aside. &quot;Of course,&quot; he said, &quot;and 
good luck.&quot;

Hazuki walked down the halls guided by memory, her steps taking her 
unerringly to the room overlooking the stream. She tapped gently on the 
wooden frame of the door and heard the Princess Fuji call out, &quot;Yes?&quot;

Soundlessly the door slid aside and Hazuki felt her breath catch a bit 
as she looked at the lovely young woman who knelt on a mat within. 
Fuji&#39;s blonde hair nearly glowed in the dim light, her kimono flowing 
around her slim body as she looked up to see who was entering. Her blue 
eyes widened, first in confusion then in a growing joy as she murmured, 
&quot;Lady Hazuki?&quot;

Hazuki felt her heart lift at the pure welcome in her eyes, the familiar 
beauty nearly overwhelming her. But even more than Hatsumi was, Fuji&#39;s 
eyes were filled with tender caring. &quot;I&#39;m back,&quot; she smiled, entering 
the room to kneel down beside her.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Fuji&#39;s eyes seemed to glow as she reached out, taking 
Hazuki&#39;s hand. She studied Hazuki&#39;s face a moment, &quot;Your quest, it 
didn&#39;t end well?&quot;

&quot;No, it didn&#39;t,&quot; Hazuki softly admitted, then she haltingly began to 
tell a tale of Eve, Hatsumi and cruel destiny.


Out in the shadows of the forest they watched, carefully concealed by 
the many branches of trees. &quot;Hitomi, is that the one our sisters 
fought?&quot; the ninja asked reverently, her long red hair flowing down her 
back.

The leader of the ninja nodded, her eyes narrowed behind her mask. &quot;Yes, 
that&#39;s her,&quot; Hitomi agreed softly. &quot;Yomi, have you called the others?&quot;

The redhead nodded as Yomi said, &quot;They&#39;re on their way now.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Hitomi said coldly as she studied Hazuki intently, &quot;then soon we 
will see... if she&#39;s really as good as we think she is.&quot;</pre>
