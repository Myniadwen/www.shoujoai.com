<h1>Growing Pains (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yamiboushi/index.html">Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mkanderson.html">Mk Anderson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Even though Hazuki had told herself over and over again that she 
shouldn&#39;t, she almost always gave in to her own weakness eventually. The 
little girl was in the garden alone with no sign of her caretaker 
anywhere nearby. She was busily throwing a small green ball around in a 
carefree manner, giggling to herself all the while. Hatsumi... she was 
only five years old.

The little child soon spotted the tall woman by the fence and raced 
clumsily over.

She had dreamt that all she had to do was leave Hatsumi to be raised by 
the stranger she had hired. Since she wasn&#39;t aging any, there wasn&#39;t any 
reason Hazuki couldn&#39;t wait for the other girl to grow up and then they 
could be together again but this was indeed just a dream after all. In 
reality she hadn&#39;t been able to keep away and in reality it was apparent 
that this Hatsumi was different.

Hazuki knew she had been foolish to think that it would just be Hatsumi 
as she had known her, in a childish body. This Hatsumi loved her Auntie 
&#39;Mura who had raised her, this Hatsumi loved her magical girls cartoons 
and of course... this Hatsumi could speak.

&quot;Hazuki!&quot;

In all the times the two of them had met, &#39;Hazuki&#39; was what the little 
girl had sharply been told to call her benefactor at all times. The 
reason for this was that while the dark haired woman may have brought 
her into this world the last thing she wanted to be thought of as was 
Hatsumi&#39;s mother. Nor could she ever be Hazuki-sama or Hazuki onee-sama. 
Hazuki could not stand the kind of relationship those names intimated. 
She had legally adopted Hatsumi, stating that she was a child she had 
found abandoned on her doorstep. The baby had cried unendingly everytime 
she had been separated from Hazuki. She had cried until she got sick and 
eventually the child welfare agencies who had initially resisted, had no 
choice but to place the infant in her care.

&quot;How are you, Hatsumi? Where is Shimura-san?&quot;

As always the best excuse she could come up for herself being there was 
to give a couple of additional instructions to the one she had left 
Hatsumi in the care of. She knew it was a feeble reason at best because 
what could not be conveyed by telephone or electronic mail these days?

&quot;Oh...&quot; The little girl sounded disappointed. The older woman never 
seemed to pay anymore than a few seconds attention to her. &quot;I&#39;m alright. 
Auntie &#39;Mura is around the back, tending the vegetables.&quot;

Hazuki nodded and strided to the back garden, not giving a backwards 
glance at the child. It was enough, that small moment had been enough to 
tide her over until... until the next time she could not bear being away 
from her love.

This is a tentative try at giving Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito a 
happy ending. I have in fact got writer&#39;s block about half-way through 
chapter 2. I&#39;m looking for a beta who can prod me into working. OO</pre>
