<h1>Another Destiny (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yamiboushi/index.html">Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../yamiboushi/anodest-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Princess Fuji gently stroked Hazuki&#39;s long black hair,
the lovely blonde looking down at the woman who&#39;s head
rested in her lap with a gentle tenderness. &quot;I&#39;ve
missed this,&quot; Fuji admitted quietly, a smile on her
face.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to be so needy,&quot; Hazuki murmured to her
quietly. After a few moments of petting she rose,
looking into Fuji&#39;s eyes as she continued a bit
sheepishly, &quot;I didn&#39;t even ask what&#39;s been happening
to you.&quot;

&quot;Not as much as you think,&quot; Fuji said calmly. She
poured each of them more tea before saying, &quot;Shortly
after you both disappeared the Spiritual Fox returned
and she came to me seeking a lord to serve.&quot;

&quot;I was a little surprised you let her stay,&quot; Hazuki
noted, drinking her tea.

&quot;I have always had a weakness for lost cats and dogs,&quot;
Fuji flashed a smile, &quot;she reminded me of them too
much.&quot;

Hazuki fought back her racing heart, shocked at the
woman&#39;s beauty. &#39;Does she know how lovely she is?&#39; she
wondered silently. &quot;I&#39;ve done my share of rescuing
cats from trees,&quot; Hazuki admitted, fond memories
bringing a smile to her face. Her expression became a
bit more serious, &quot;We encountered those Ninja on the
way here.. have they made trouble?&quot;

Fuji looked annoyed, taking a drink of her tea with
unconscious grace. &quot;Yes,&quot; she nodded, &quot;they&#39;ve made
several attempts to break into the palace here.
Thankfully my samurai are determined to make up for
their original failure facing them.&quot;

&quot;And the captain I fought?&quot; Hazuki asked seriously,
remembering the gray haired older man who had
unleashed various techniques on her. To his surprise
his various ninja skills seemed to fail against
Hazuki, though neither of them fully understood why.

&quot;He hasn&#39;t returned,&quot; Fuji reassured her, &quot;in fact it
seems the ninja are looking for you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Hazuki frowned.

&#39;It&#39;s odd,&#39; Fuji silently thought, &#39;that an expression
that should have made Hazuki ugly instead simply makes
seem her more lovely to me, simmering with passionate
intensity.&#39; Recovering herself after a moment of
distraction Fuji said, &quot;They seem driven to face you
in battle, possibly to avenge their lord&#39;s defeat.&quot;

Hazuki reached out to lay a hand on the sword that
rested on the floor beside her, her expression
thoughtful. &quot;Then maybe I should answer their
challenge,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;it might even end their
threat to you.&quot;

Fuji felt herself instinctively opening her mouth to
forbid Hazuki from facing them, only to stop herself
in surprise. For all her life warriors had pledged
themselves to her, and she knew that at least some of
them had fallen because of that. &#39;So why does it
bother me so that Hazuki might be putting herself in
danger?&#39; she wondered.

Hazuki seemed to read her expression, her own gaze
softening. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to worry you,&quot; she took Fuji&#39;s
hand in hers, &quot;I&#39;ll be careful, no matter what I
decide to do.&quot;

Fuji felt herself smile even as she squeezed Hazuki&#39;s
hands firmly. &quot;I don&#39;t remember you being very
cautious,&quot; she gently chided Hazuki, &quot;considering you
rushed in to face the ninja&#39;s and their lord all
alone.&quot;

Hazuki met Fuji&#39;s eyes with simple honesty. &quot;You were
in danger,&quot; she said to her directly, &quot;I couldn&#39;t bear
that.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Fuji looked away, blushing faintly. She
opened up her mouth to say something more to Hazuki...

...when a soft knocking drew their attention from each
other. &quot;Princess?&quot; the soft voice called from the
hallway.

Fuji pulled back from how close she and Hazuki had
been leaning towards each other, gazing into each
other&#39;s eyes. &quot;Yes?&quot; she called out, surprised to feel
faintly hoarse,

The door slid open to reveal the leader of her
personal guard, the older samurai kneeling
respectfully beside the door. &quot;There is a ninja
waiting by the front gates,&quot; he reported grimly,
&quot;asking for the Lady Hazuki.&quot;

&quot;Did you see any more of them?&quot; Hazuki asked as she
snatched up her sword, her eyes narrowing in anger as
she tensed for battle.

&quot;No, but there could be many in the shadows nearby,&quot;
he conceded. The samurai looked at Hazuki and Fuji,
&quot;What do you want to do?&quot;

Fuji put a hand on Hazuki&#39;s arm, squeezing lightly. &quot;I
suppose you won&#39;t listen if I order you not to see
them?&quot; she asked.

&quot;If they&#39;re seriously interested in me they could
threaten you or the others if I don&#39;t go,&quot; Hazuki
answered, gently putting her hand over Fuji&#39;s.

&quot;I know,&quot; Fuji acknowledged. She hesitated, meeting
Hazuki&#39;s eyes then bent forward to kiss her softly on
the mouth. &quot;Be careful,&quot; she breathed out after a
moment.

&quot;Always,&quot; Hazuki answered softly, her gaze lingering a
moment before getting up and following the samurai
from the room.

The redheaded ninja girl stood by the gate, her mane
of hair shimmering in the sun. Like the other women
she wore simple garb, a wrap-like bikini top and
bottom combined with a metallic mask, boots and
gloves. While they weren&#39;t visible weapons were hidden
amidst her garb, ready to be used at a moments notice.

&quot;Watch my back,&quot; Hazuki murmured under her breath to
the samurai before striding away from him over to
where the woman waited. &quot;You wanted to see me?&quot; Hazuki
asked, letting her hand rest comfortably on her
sword&#39;s hilt.

&quot;Yes, lady,&quot; she nodded, clearly displeased at using
the honorific. She studied Hazuki coldly, &quot;Our
mistress wishes to see you.&quot;

Hazuki studied her thoughtfully for a moment, &quot;You&#39;ll
guarantee safe conduct for me to and from the
meeting?&quot;

The ninja nodded with a smile. &quot;Indeed,&quot; she purred,
&quot;I swear on my name, Yomi.&quot;

&quot;Do you trust her?&quot; the samurai asked Hazuki bluntly
after she filled him in on the progress of the
negotiations.

&quot;Not entirely, but I think I can handle it,&quot; Hazuki
said honestly. She smiled grimly, &quot;If this is a trick,
make sure that the Princess is kept safe, please.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; the samurai nodded firmly.

Hazuki strode over to the ninja Yomi&#39;s side and
without another word they walked off together, Hazuki
keeping a wary eye out. It wasn&#39;t long before they
reached the clearing, the band of ninja women watching
with silent intensity as they walked up.

&quot;Hitomi,&quot; Yomi nodded respectfully, &quot;I&#39;ve brought her
as ordered.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hitomi nodded, her long brown hair
flowing. She looked Hazuki over a moment then asked,
&quot;Will you face me in battle, samurai?&quot;

Hazuki tensed as the ninja spread out around the
clearing to watch. &quot;If I must,&quot; she said, resting her
hand on the hilt of her sword.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Hitomi cried out as she leapt, sword flashing,
only to be parried with remarkable speed. Hazuki&#39;s
eyes flashed as they stood there frozen, muscles
straining, the she shifted and they pulled apart. Back
and forth across the clearing they fought, blades
ringing, but Hitomi seemed unable to gain any
advantage.

Finally Hitomi raised a hand, panting softly. &quot;Yes?&quot;
Hazuki asked warily.

&quot;You are as good as we heard,&quot; Hitomi conceded, &quot;or
even better.&quot; She sheathed her sword then,
surprisingly, kneeled. &quot;Let us serve you, m&#39;lady, eve
as we did our lord before.&quot;

&quot;Eeehh?!&quot; Hazuki blurted.

Later that evening Fuji smiled as she and Hazuki stood
on the bridge, looking out over the water. &quot;Have you
decided what to do?&quot; she asked her softly.

Hazuki looked amused, &quot;I accepted their service, I
didn&#39;t think there was much choice.&quot; She sighed, &quot;I
sent them out bandit hunting, maybe that way they can
do some good.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Fuji agreed. She hesitated, studying
Hazuki with a expression of gentle longing, &quot;Lady
Hazuki, are you leaving again soon?&quot;

Hazuki met her eyes, then around them at the beautiful
palace. More than ever before she felt at peace, the
odd restlessness that had always driven her finally
stilled. &quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere,&quot; she answered
honestly, &quot;at least, not unless you send me away.&quot;

&quot;Never,&quot; Fuji said firmly, resting her hand on
Hazuki&#39;s arm. She looked away with a faint blush, &quot;I
knew that sending you on your way before was the right
thing to do... but almost as soon as I did I missed
you, more than I could say.&quot;

&quot;And I,&quot; Hazuki agreed softly, wondering why it had
never occurred to her to just stay. But she had needed
to see Hatsumi once again... if only to say good-bye.
&quot;There&#39;s no place in the worlds I&#39;d rather be than
here,&quot; Hazuki finished.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Fuji answered as she stepped a little
closer. She gently tugged Hazuki to her, hesitating
until she saw the other woman smile, then she kissed
her gently.

End

Notes: This was inspired by talk on the shoujoai
forums, as well as my own ideas that Fuji and Hazuki
would make a good couple. This also doesn&#39;t exactly
contradict the ending of Yami to Boushi either, it&#39;s
quite possible Hazuki could end up giving birth to Eve
in Fuji&#39;s world.</pre>
