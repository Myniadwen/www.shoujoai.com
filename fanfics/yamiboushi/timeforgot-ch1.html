<h1>A Time Forgotten</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yamiboushi/index.html">Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arana.html">Arana</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Notes: This yuri (girl/girl) fanfic is based off the short TV
series of Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito. Why? Because I
don&#39;t own the game and am too lazy to go to the trouble of
finding a game I would really be able to play because my
Japanese is pretty nonexistent. With that out of the way, this
is a &#39;fill in the space&#39; type fic where a scene had started but
cuts off or fades to black at a point where I don&#39;t feel
satisfied, so I&#39;m forced to write bad fic to appease myself and
made a handful of other people that thought something should&#39;ve
happened there. In this case, this is a fill in of what happens
after the kiss in the last episode. If you haven&#39;t watched it
yet, ummm.I&#39;d recommend doing so. 

And so, on with the show!

       &#39;Something terrible will happen if I open this door.&#39;
       Hatsuki stood in front of the door that had become so
familiar to her throughout the course of her short life. A
simple sign with the name &#39;Hatsumi&#39; upon it specified to whom
the room belonged to but it wasn&#39;t like it was hard to figure
out with only the two of them living in the house. Her hand
continued to linger on the handle as she pondered over why she
was being forced to relive a moment so painful to her. A moment
where she lost everything that made her life worth living.
       &#39;I know what this is supposed to mean,&#39; was what she had
thought next, wasn&#39;t it? She bit back a bitter laugh as she
remembered what she had thought it would mean. That she would
enter the room of her forbidden, unanswered love, steal a kiss
while she was sleeping and be forever hated by the one she
would do anything to have her return the feelings. And she had,
she had crossed over from world to world searching for Hatsumi,
enduring fights both physical and emotional. And now for some
reason, the cycle would be repeated. Or at least Hatsumi&#39;s
disappearing. She shook her head slightly, angry with herself
for doubting even for a second. &#39;No, if she disappears again, I
*will* go find her and the way to have her come back home...come
back to me.&#39;

       Hatsuki took one last sharp breath and held it as she
turned the handle, quietly opened the door and stepped into the
room. She exhaled softly as she closed the door, her eyes fixed
upon Hatsumi&#39;s sleeping form. Everything was as Hatsuki
remembered as she stood there gazing upon the small woman
before her - the cover sheet gathered at the bottom of the bed,
legs curled up slightly, Hatsumi&#39;s chest rising and falling
steadily as her blonde hair spilled around her on the pillow
and her slightly flushed cheeks. If she hadn&#39;t known what was
going to happen, Hatsuki would be able to think it one of the
most beautiful sights she had ever seen.
       &#39;But I do know,&#39; was all Hatsuki thought as she sat down
upon the bed, her gaze falling upon the bandaged wound she
herself had inflicted on Hatsumi in a fit of anger and
jealousy...but most of all, regret. Her eyes then traced farther
up to her peaceful sleeping facing, taking a moment to brush
away a bit of hair. &#39;Regret, huh? Regret that just maybe, if I
had said or done something to make you understand. To make it
clear and absolute.these feelings I harbor for you, Hatsumi.
Maybe if I had done that, none of this would have happened.  I
wouldn&#39;t have lost you first to some boy.and then to your true
self.&#39;
       Hatsuki&#39;s eyes wavered and threatened to tear up as she
whispered, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. Hatsumi.&quot; pausing for a few beats to
look upon the soft lips that would never be claimed by her own.
Then with a heavy heart, she slowly started to lean over, her
face drawing closer and closer to Hatsumi&#39;s, still hoping that
maybe this time, whatever gods would forgive her long enough to
have one tiny moment of bliss.
       The clock next to the bed beeped softly as the soft
yellow-lighted numbers of 11:59 switched to read 12:00. Then a
soft voice spoke.

       &quot;Hatsuki-chan.&quot;
       Still taken back by surprise from hearing words spoken
from the girl before her, Hatsuki stood up quickly and blurted
out, &quot;Hatsumi, you can speak?&quot;
       The girl&#39;s eyes fluttered open to reveal the soft red
pools gazing upon Hatsuki. As she sat up, Hatsumi heard Hatsuki
call out to her again, to which she answered with a simple
shaking of her head.
       Only a few seconds had passed but even in that short
time, Hatsuki knew for certain that something was different
this time around. Hatsumi was supposed to be enveloped in a
green light by now, wasn&#39;t she? What the heck was going on?!
Her confusion vanished as she realized that Hatsumi was
holding her hand out to her. Hatsuki had to take a moment to
take a breath, to test to see if this was real because it
wasn&#39;t supposed to be. Sure enough though, Hatsumi continued to
leave her hand extended out to her, eyes softening as she
smiled up at her as if saying, &#39;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m here. I&#39;m real.&#39;
       &#39;Come to me.&#39;
       Still filled with doubt, Hatsuki tentatively reached out to
Hatsumi, bracing herself mentally and emotionally should she
wake up and find out this is all a dream or illusion. But as
flesh met flesh, and Hatsumi&#39;s fingers wrapped around her hand,
she had to stop herself from crying right then and there.
&#39;This.this is real. She&#39;s still right here in front of me. Oh
Hatsumi.&#39;
       Hatsumi gently pulled her over just enough so that
Hatsuki was once again sitting on the bed next to her, level
enough so that their contrasting deep blue and yielding red
eyes could meet. A million thoughts were flooding Hatsuki&#39;s
mind, leaving her unable to do anything but continue to looking
upon her sister. &#39;I don&#39;t understand, none of this is going
like before. I&#39;m.not complaining I guess but now what? Could it
be that.this Hatsumi remembered what happened? Is she changing
the world...for me? Even if she is, what are we supposed to do?&#39;
       The blonde girl merely tilted her head ever so slightly
and a soft voice broke through the confusion surrounding
Hatsuki. &#39;Something that should&#39;ve happened worlds ago,
Hatsuki.&#39; She reached out again to younger girl, this time
gently cupping her cheek then sliding down her dark silken hair
until it came to rest upon Hatsuki&#39;s arm, gripping just enough
so that she could show just what she wanted as she pulled her
even closer.
       A small gasp escaped Hatsuki&#39;s lips as she came to
realize just what was going to happen next. She could feel her
heart start racing in her chest as Hatsumi continued to draw
her closer and closer. She wanted to reach out to hold Hatsumi
as well but feared again that any sudden change would cause her
to wake up from this moment. After all, even Hatsumi as Eve had
said that even though she wanted to be back with Hatsuki, it
was a dream that could never be realized.but as she felt the
warm breath exhaled from the other woman upon her skin, she
knew there was no reason for her to doubt any longer. She
surrendered herself to the moment, eyes closing just before she
felt even warmer lips press against her own in a sweet kiss.
&#39;So soft...&#39; was all she could manage to think as pleasure she
never thought imaginable from a simple kiss coursed through
every bit of her being. With nothing left to fear, she finally
reached out to hold her beloved, pulling her even closer,
wanting to feel as much of Hatsumi as possible in this one
moment.
       She smiled and sighed in relief inwardly as Hatsumi
opened her eyes slight to look upon the girl embracing her. &#39;I
always knew somehow Hatsuki.those feeling that you held back
for me. But I was afraid, we both were. But I don&#39;t care
anymore. Even if Adam or God punishes me for this, I just want
to share this last night with you before we&#39;re separated
again.&#39;

       Time passed slowly as the kiss continued, simple and
sweet until they separated, a small string of saliva still
connecting them until it fell. Every bit of love and emotion
that Hatsuki had welled up inside, overwhelmed her as she laid
her head upon the soft support of Hatsumi&#39;s bosom. Just as
always, she felt arms wrap around her, inviting and comforting.
       &quot;Would it be okay to stay like this...for a little while?&quot;
       Hatsumi just closed her eyes as she pulled Hatsuki
closer to her, gently stroking her hair. &#39;I won&#39;t deny you
anything Hatsuki. Tonight is for you. This is my gift. My
feelings for you and only you. The one person who dares to
cherish and love me the most with no boundaries.&#39; Not wanting
to wait any longer, Hatsumi ran her fingers ever so slightly
through soft indigo hair, then back up along her neck, feeling
Hatsuki shiver slightly against the sensation as she did so,
until she had cupped her chin. &#39;And tonight, you will know just
what those feelings mean to me.and how deep my own love for you
goes Hatsuki,&#39; she thought as once again her lips found what
they sought, the kiss filled with more need and passion this
time as she leaned forward, forcing Hatsuki to fall back upon
the bed.
       The kiss separated as Hatsuki&#39;s head hit the pillow
below her, giving her just a moment to stutter out, &quot;H-Hatsumi,
wait, what&#39;re-&quot; before the sweet warmth of lips returned to
their task. While part of Hatsuki was happier than she&#39;d ever
been, another part of her was wondering just how far Hatsumi
was going to take this.and why. She had said that she loved her
when they were in the Universe Garden world but enough to do
what she was thinking? &#39;No...this isn&#39;t right. No matter how much
I want it, it means nothing if Hatsumi doesn&#39;t want me the same
way!&#39;
       &quot;Hatsumi, stop!&quot;
       The kiss was broken again but this time from Hatsuki
pushing Hatsumi away, her hands trembling as she held her back.
&quot;We shouldn&#39;t do this, not unless I know for sure. Unless I
know you&#39;re not just doing this for me. If you are, then we can
just stop here. You&#39;ve given me so much already, even this
second chance. It&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll be okay, alright?&quot;
       Hatsumi just stared down in disbelief until her features
softened again, and took one hand upon her shoulders into her
own and brought it to her lips to place a kiss upon Hatsuki&#39;s
palm. Her eyes welled up with tears as she then placed the hand
upon her cheek, and with so much affection said, &quot;Oh
Hatsuki...you&#39;re so hopeless sometimes. Of course, I want this as
much as you. I&#39;m here with you now, am I not? But if you can&#39;t
believe that, then believe these words...&quot; She took the hand that
was against her cheek, pressed it against her chest over her
heart and leaned over so that her lips were barely brushing up
against Hatsuki&#39;s own, then whispered, &quot;While I am Eve, my
heart remains true as it was when I was Hatsumi. And whether my
name is Eve, Hatsumi or any other, my heart will always love
you the most, more than anyone in all the worlds.&quot;
       Tears held back now fell upon Hatsuki&#39;s flushed cheeks,
and as they slowly seeped into her, so did open honesty of the
words just spoken to her. Words she had longed to hear and feel
them resonate within her, filling her with an overwhelming joy.
Her own vision blurred as tears started to well up in her eyes
as she embraced the girl above her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Hatsumi. I do
believe you. I was an idiot to doubt it for a second. I&#39;m so
sorry.&quot; She wiped the tears from both their eyes then smiled
warmly up at her love and said, &quot;I love you too,&quot; before
pulling her into another kiss.

       Clothes found their way to the floor and the girls sat
with only one thing remaining upon them. The bandages upon
Hatsumi&#39;s arm and the bandages Hatsuki always had wrapped about
her ankle. Hatsuki unwrapped the bandages around Hatsumi&#39;s arm
to find not even a scratch there. Hatsumi simply smiled, &quot;It&#39;s
my &#39;story&#39; after all,&quot; then reached down to relieve Hatsuki of
her own bandages. She tilted her head slightly as Hatsumi
carefully rolled the bandage up, &quot;You know, now that I think
about it, I don&#39;t really remember why I started wearing that in
the first place.&quot;
       &quot;It&#39;s because you thought it would tie you to me.&quot;
       &quot;Really?&quot;
       Hatsumi chuckled slightly and nodded. &quot;Yes, this is from
the first time I had to bandage you after you fought with those
boys, driving them away from me.&quot;
       Hatsuki felt her cheeks turn hot as she pouted slightly,
&quot;Well someone was has to regulate how nice you are to people or
else I&#39;d never have any peace of mind.&quot;
       &quot;Oh you&#39;re so cute when you blush like that!&quot; Hatsumi
continued to chuckle a little before running a finger along the
bandage, &quot;But you won&#39;t be needing this anymore after tonight.&quot;
She placed it on the shelf then took Hatsuki&#39;s hand and
intertwined their fingers, &quot;We&#39;re tied together with something
much stronger than that now. And even though it will take some
time, I&#39;ll come back to you. I promise.&quot;
       Hatsuki just nodded and smiled as she pulled the other
girl to her, &quot;That&#39;s &#39;then&#39;, this is &#39;now&#39;. Come here.&quot;

       It was like nothing she had ever experience and would
ever experience again in her lifetime. Even the few times
Hatsuki had had to sate herself after watching Hatsumi bathe or
the like was nothing compared to the havoc being unleashed upon
her senses from the girl&#39;s ministrations. Hatsumi sat atop of
Hatsuki, and had started by nuzzling her hand, then kissing and
suckling upon her finger. She continued this as she trailed up
along her wrist then arm until she reached her neck, pausing
there to work upon the sensitive flesh about the collarbone and
around her ears.
       Hatsuki could feel a pressure start to build inside her,
growing more and more as the blonde girl gave her one last
passionate kiss before moving farther down to her breasts,
gently massaging and nuzzling the soft mounds before she
brought her mouth into play. Hatsuki cried out and arched her
back as her breasts were ravished with kisses and more,
gripping tightly onto the sheets to anchor herself from being
lost in the pleasure of it all.
       A grin formed on Hatsumi&#39;s face as the sweet sounds of
Hatsuki&#39;s voice crying out and moaning came to her ears. &#39;And
we still have a bit to go,&#39; she thought to herself as she pull
herself back up to kiss her love again, tongues clashing
together. She felt hands slide down along her back and come to
rest upon her buttocks, gripping enough to make her moan into
the kiss. A second later, the kiss broke as Hatsumi cried out
and sat up a bit from Hatsuki&#39;s leg sliding between her legs,
putting pressure on the sensitive flesh already damp from
excitement. The cries died down to soft whimpers as Hatsuki
took the opportunity to rain Hatsumi&#39;s breasts and neck with
kisses of her own.
       Already so close, Hatsumi took one of Hatsuki&#39;s hands
and intertwined their fingers again while her other hand
slipped down from her chest, past her stomach and to cup the
other girl&#39;s warm flesh, once again forcing her to cry out and
arch her back to add to the pressure of pleasure, pain, wanting
and savoring that had built up.
       She waited until the younger girl calmed down a bit
before leaning over, her blonde hair falling past her and
mixing in with the dark blue locks spilled all around the bed.
Another kiss, this one slow but spoke worlds of love, passion
and hunger for their partner. &#39;Together.we&#39;ll do this
together.&#39;
       The kiss broke but not their eye contact as Hatsumi
slowly dragged herself along Hatsuki&#39;s leg while dragging her
finger across the girl&#39;s own lust, causing them both to breathe
in sharply at the sensation. Their eyes and fingers stayed
locked though as the pressure built between the two, each
calling out to the other amongst the other cries, whimpers and
moans until finally...release. A heavenly green light enveloped
them both as waves of ecstasy wash over and coursed through
them.

       As they laid in each other&#39;s arms, chests rising and
falling heavily as they tried to catch their breath, the light
slowly faded to a small glow. Hatsuki ran one of hands gently
through Hatsumi&#39;s hair, enjoying the simple pleasure of feeling
her head resting upon her chest. After a few moments, she
brought the hand that was still holding Hatsumi&#39;s into her line
of vision, and noticed the glow. She felt her heart sink as she
guessed- no -knew- what it meant. She sighed, &quot;This is it,
isn&#39;t it?&quot; She felt the grip on her hand tighten slightly as
Hatsumi lifted herself up enough to look into her eyes,
&quot;Yes.and no. This will be the first and last night we get to be
together like this.&quot;
       She laid her head back upon Hatsuki&#39;s chest and fought
to keep her tears back, &quot;But I&#39;ll be back. So don&#39;t forget me,
okay? No matter how long it takes, remember me, Hatsuki.&quot;
       Hatsuki rolled over so that she could look down upon the
quivering red eyes of her beloved, &quot;I will. Even if God or
whoever tries to make me forget.I&#39;ll find a way. I promise.&quot;
       The girls smiled softly at each other as tears fell, and
they shared one last kiss.

       Dawn had already passed and the morning birds were
already twittering as light filled the room from the large
glass windows, bathing the sleeping figure in it. Hatsuki&#39;s
eyes finally fluttered open and took in her surroundings as she
rolled over onto her back. Realizing whatever she was lying on
wasn&#39;t exactly comfortable, she sat up and looked around.
       &quot;I fell asleep in the empty room.&quot;
       &#39;Strange.that dream felt so real though. I almost feel
sad thinking about it. Like I lost something important and am
waiting for it to come back. Ah, I&#39;m so bad at remembering my
dreams. But.even though I lost it and I&#39;m sad, I feel that it
will definitely come back to me some day.&#39;

       Lilith watched as her sister replaced a book back on the
shelf then reach into her pocket to pull out a small roll of
bandages. It seemed strangely familiar but she couldn&#39;t place
it.
       &quot;Hey Eve, what&#39;s that?&quot;
       &quot;Oh, just a memento.&quot;
       &quot;A memento? Of what?&quot;
       &quot;Just...a time forgotten.&quot;

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Yay! It&#39;s over! You&#39;re suffering stops here! So uh yeah, that&#39;s
all there is. Sorry if you actually expecting something good or
at least a gratuitous hentai yuri scene but I&#39;m not really good
at either. If you&#39;re wondering about the whole bandage thing,
if you watch episode 13, during the whole last night with
Hatsumi, she still has the bandage but when she wakes up the
next morning, it&#39;s not there anymore. Whether that was actually
intentional or not, I don&#39;t know but I thought I&#39;d write in
there anyways. Don&#39;t post this anywhere without asking my 
permission first. Any constructive commentary or criticism is 
welcome, while everything else will probably be tossed into 
Yahoo Mail trash HELL. Be excellent to each other and party on 
dudes.
