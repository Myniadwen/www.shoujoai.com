<h1>Growing Pains (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yamiboushi/index.html">Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mkanderson.html">Mk Anderson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>NOTE: In the beginning as the chapters are short, I will be releasing 
two at a time. I divided the chapter as we the different ages we see 
Hatsumi. Once the chapters get longer as she grows older and I have more 
to write about her development, I will change to one chapter at a time.

Prologue

I had always known this day was coming, as the years went by I could 
feel the energy slowly growing within my body. She was in there. When I 
was younger and the thoughts first began to surface, I had my doubts. I 
thought perhaps it was all been a dream and yet it was one that clung to 
the surface of my mind and refused to be forgotten. Ririsu, that stupid 
bird and Eve... Hatsumi.

The memories had slowly trickled back throughout the years as though the 
ice encasing them were gradually melting and returning rivulets of 
forgotten moments to me... Youko, Kuiru, Miruka, Princess Fuji, 
everyone... I know now the reason why I had always known that I would 
have a child and what her name would be. This was because it was 
Hatsumi&#39;s way of returning and coming home to me. So while I waited, I 
threw myself into school, into work, into everything so that time would 
pass faster. Pass it did but then I began noticing that even as life 
went by my body seemed frozen in the image of youthfulness. Of course, 
it was just like what had happened to those other two that had been 
bathed in Eve&#39;s souma.

Now I am lying here on the thinly carpeted floor of that same empty room 
I had found myself waking up on forty eight years ago. Hatsumi&#39;s old 
room was what I knew it to be from my old memories of a life that didn&#39;t 
happen. This house was only a husk without her in it to make it warm but 
I couldn&#39;t have born selling it even though I was rarely there with the 
constant traveling I have been doing. Make up was no longer being a very 
effective way to hide the fact that even though I was supposed to be 
sixty four, I looked no older than twenty three so it became important 
that I was never anywhere long enough to be recognized anymore. However, 
I had recently met with a useful man by the name of &#39;Smith&#39; who seemed 
willing to help me with some documents with minimal questions. I&#39;m 
hoping that this will allow me to settle down again for at least 
sometime.

Pain hit hard and fast and even as I grappled for something to hold onto 
my hands found nothing but air and dusty carpet. That green glow from so 
long ago began filling the room, emanating from my womb. Before too long 
it began fading, leaving me in an agonized heap and the room suddenly 
seemed eerily quiet but for my laboured breathing. I suppose that I had 
expected more lights and dazzle and less pain through this ordeal, it 
was not as though I had the luxury of pain medication as one would have 
had in normal circumstances. The pain receded and after a few moments to 
catch my breath I managed to sit up. Lying on my jacket which I had laid 
down in the corner earlier was a small, delicate infant with soft blonde 
fuzz and crimson eyes.
