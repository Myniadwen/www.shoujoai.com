A twelve year old Hatsumi stared out the open window of her room. There 
was a soft breeze that caused the curtains to billow in and out gently 
but the teenager paid that very little attention. Her thoughts were on 
Hazuki, the mysterious woman who would simply appear out of the blue to 
visit and then disappear just as suddenly. The older woman had never 
spoken more than just a few words to blonde girl but Hatsumi could 
always feel the intensity behind the seemingly cold blue eyes that bore 
into her own when Hazuki said anything to her. Hatsumi shivered in 
remembrance of several such occasions.

Azuma Hazuki was a puzzle to her. Shimura had told her they story of how 
Hazuki had found her, adopted her and then placed her in the kind older 
woman&#39;s care but somehow she knew there was something not quite right 
about all of it. Why would Hazuki do such a thing? Something like taking 
in a child but not try and raise or even seem to care about her? More 
important than that, why was it that while she loved Shimura who had 
looked after her all this time did she feel so much stronger a feeling 
towards a woman she hardly knew beyond the fact that she paid for her 
upbringing?

Hatsumi furrowed her brow in thought, something that made her high 
forehead even more prominent than usual. The serious air of melancholy 
around her dark-haired benefactor never changed, she was always sad. For 
as long as she could remember Hazuki had been like that. Actually for as 
long as she remembered, Hazuki had always been the same... She had 
noticed it as she was growing up how with each birthday, she grew taller 
and her body changed but for Hazuki, that had stopped. It wasn&#39;t a case 
of her being an adult and not growing. It was that she never aged at 
all. The real surprise though, was that it didn&#39;t really even surprise 
her. Something in her had accepted this as how things were supposed to 
be.

Footsteps coming from below disturbed her from her reverie and looking 
down through the window, she was startled to see the very subject of her 
thoughts making her way up to the front of the house. Hatsumi quickly 
scrambled from the window seat and straightened herself up before 
practically hurtling down the stairs so that she could be the one to 
reach the door before Shimura. She knew that if she didn&#39;t then Hazuki 
would most likely not even greet her before holing herself up in the 
study with her caretaker.

She didn&#39;t even wait for the knock on the door before she flung it open 
and came face to face with a rather surprised Hazuki who had her hand 
raised with the intention of knocking.

&quot;Hatsumi... you are quick.&quot;

The young blonde nodded and smiled brightly up at the taller woman. &quot;I 
saw you coming from the window. I think Aunt &#39;Mura has just stepped out 
for a moment, she should be back soon.&quot;

She stepped aside so that Hazuki could enter the house and pulled out a 
new pair of house slippers from the shoe cabinet for their guest. Her 
heart was thumping against her chest like crazy and Hatsumi had to take 
in a quick breath to calm herself down again.

&quot;Why don&#39;t we go into the living room to wait? I-I&#39;ll bring in some 
tea.&quot; At Hazuki&#39;s curt nod, she hurriedly scurried ahead to the living 
room. Making sure the tall woman was seated and fairly comfortable, 
Hatsumi went into the kitchen to make the tea.

The sound of the kettle being filled, cabinets being opened and the 
tinkling of teacups were soon heard coming from the kitchen as the young 
girl bustled about preparing the tea. As Hazuki sat there waiting she 
couldn&#39;t help but think how Hatsumi was growing up. To Hazuki it 
sometimes seemed that time passed all too quickly and yet there were 
times that it seemed to flow excruciatingly slowly. The twelve year-old 
was getting closer and closer to how she remembered Hatsumi before. The 
then older girl had never been very tall and this Hatsumi was just 
lacking in those final couple of inches before catching up with her 
former self. The child Hatsumi was, Hazuki realized, was growing into a 
woman.

&quot;Yaa... She&#39;s done it again!&quot; A peeved Ririsu whined loudly to the musty 
book filled stacks of the great library. Indeed, apart from an 
overweight yellow canary with a Kansai accent, she was the only living 
being in the library.

&quot;Ooh, that Eve has done it this time! She promised that she wouldn&#39;t 
leave me behind alone again! Idiot big forehead endowed girl!&quot; Ririsu 
knew exactly which series of book contained worlds to check first for 
her wayward little sister.

&quot;No, no, no... Oh, Hazuki in a swimsuit... oops, I guess I shouldn&#39;t be 
getting sidetracked... although I still think she&#39;d look better in a 
two-piece...&quot;

Ririsu continued to search through the series until she came across one 
that she thought could be it.

&quot;Hmph when I get my hands on you then you&#39;re toast, you brat! Ken-chan! 
I&#39;m leaving things here up to you, okay? Don&#39;t mess up!&quot;

&quot;Ririsu, wait! You ca&#151;&quot; Before the chubby bird could finish protesting, 
Ririsu was gone in a burst of sparkles.

&quot;Dammit.&quot;

I was unable to find that beta but I thought I would just post what I 
had so far until I got the inspiration to write more or something to 
prod me enough work. I will be re-watching Yamibou when I have the time 
and hopefully that will get me writing again.</pre>
