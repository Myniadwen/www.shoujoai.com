<h1>Midnight Love Duel</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../realbout/index.html">Real Bout High School</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rbutler.html">Rashaan Butler</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The time is well into the evening, midnight to be exact. In a 
forested area on the grounds of the Kiribayashi estate, two female 
figures can be seen standing in a small cleaning. One is a tall 
curvaceous redhead who hair is tied in a high ponytail and is 
wielding a bokken. She currently wears a black leather vest zipped 
up almost to the top, which in turn is covered by a small piece of 
blue kimono-like cloth that is tied underneath her ample bosom. 
Her arms are covered by long black armbands which run from bellow 
her shoulder to a few inches above her wrist and her hands have 
black leather gloves on them. A short, tight white pleated skirt 
emphasizes her slender waist and shapely rear end while black 
stockings and black leather boots complete the rather alluring 
outfit. Those native to the area would recognize her as Daimon 
High School&#39;s samurai girl idol and Kendo champion, Ryoko 
Mitsurugi. The other is slightly shorter with long dark hair and 
wields a naginata. Her outfit is a hakama set consisting of a 
white gi-like top, red pants, white socks and sandals. Crimson 
fingerless gloves cover her hands while white wrappings cover her 
forearms, which are protected by purple metal guards. This 
particular lady happens to be Azumi Kiribayashi, user of her 
family&#39;s Naginata-style and Ryoko&#39;s main female rival. 

Earlier in the day, the spear woman had invited her sword swinging 
counterpart over to her home for a sparing match. For some reason 
she could not fathom, Ryoko accepted. Relations between the two 
had never been completely friendly, but also not overly hostile. 
They could be civil to each other occasionally, but lately things 
had been changing between them, especially in light of their 
mutual love interest, Kendo team captain Tatsuya Shishikura, 
moving to Osaka. Ryoko knew that their K-Fight at Daimon High a 
few days ago wasn&#39;t over Tatsuya. Azumi in her own twisted way was 
trying to help Ryoko out of the emotional rut the samurai idol had 
been in. And at the train station where they secretly saw him off, 
Ryoko realized that Azumi was a good person beneath all the 
snobbery. In fact when Azumi expressed her own sorrows over 
Tatsuya moving, Ryoko decided to invite the rich girl to lunch in 
order to cheer her up. It was quite pleasant to say the least. The 
conversation they had was their friendliest to date, each getting 
to know more about the other, discussing their like, dislikes, 
plans for the future, etc. Ryoko realized that she did care about 
Azumi, much more she would ever admit, and that Azumi probably 
felt the same about her. But enough of that for now. There was I 
match to be fought.

The match was very intense. No longer debilitated by her troubled 
emotions, Ryoko put up a much better fight than last time, 
matching Azumi blow for blow at every turn. Azumi was in top form 
as well keeping up with Ryoko hit for hit, counter for counter, 
neither fighter able to get a definite advantage.  The forest was 
alive with feminine grunts and the sounds of wood smacking wood. 
If one were to look closely, you could see smiles on both women&#39;s 
faces, the smile of a martial artist enjoying a good challenge, 
but in their eyes you could see something a bit more.

After about 20 minutes, Ryoko decided to end the match in a rather 
bold manner. Clashing her bokken with Azumi&#39;s naginata, she pushed 
up and over, twirling both combatants&#39; bodies around and towards 
each other. They met in the middle of the small clearing, their 
front sides pressing against each other. Their weapons were locked 
behind Azumi&#39;s back. The two fighting femmes were panting hard 
from their well-fought match. As they calmed down and caught their 
breath, the smiles they were wearing grew a bit wider, matching 
the feelings expressed in their eyes. After a few minutes of
silence, Ryoko voiced out her opinion of their spar.

&quot;Why don&#39;t we.... call this a draw,&quot; Ryoko said softly. Azumi&#39;s 
response was a delicate, alluring giggle.

&quot;Fine with me.&quot;

They both continued to stare into each other eyes, their soft yet 
firm bodies press firmly against each other, feeling the strength 
the other possessed, noting how the moonlight illuminated their 
delicate yet powerful features. Ryoko in particular was entranced 
by Azumi&#39;s hazel brown eyes. Looking downward she noted that on 
Azumi a hakama was a bit more form-fitting, emphasizing her ample 
curves. Ryoko especially drunk in the sight of Azumi&#39;s cherry red 
lips, graceful swanlike neck, and the tantalizing cleavage her top 
revealed. Their match had also caused both females to sweat 
profusely, drenching their clothing. In particular, it made 
Azumi&#39;s white top slightly see through, giving Ryoko a pretty nice 
view of what was inside.  While Ryoko was not a lesbian by any 
means, she knew right then and there that she was definitely 
attracted to her romantic/martial artistic rival.
Azumi in turn was drawn in by Ryoko&#39;s deep purple eyes. She noted 
that Ryoko was a bit more muscular than the average female, but it 
made her look incredibly sexy. Her eyes moved down to Ryoko&#39;s own 
strawberry colored lips, than on to her generous chest. The zipper 
of her vest was undone a couple of inches, revealing a sliver of 
creamy-white cleavage, which her own was currently pressed 
against.

Both women&#39;s gaze returned upward to their heavily lidded eyes, 
seeing the mutual lust each other held. They both knew something 
had to be done to spur the action they both wished to take. It was 
done by Azumi who took her right index finger and ran it slowly, 
tantalizingly so, from Ryoko&#39;s collarbone down to her cleavage. 
Feeling that, Ryoko could hold back no longer. She begin moving 
her head slightly downward (Azumi was not that much shorter than 
Ryoko) toward her rivals, with Azumi&#39;s reciprocating by moving 
upwards. Their mouths were parted slightly, the tips of their 
tongues resting on the bottom lip. They finally met in a sweet 
kiss, their eyes closing as they came together.

The kiss started out soft, then grew more passionate as time went 
on, their tongues darting in and out of each others mouths. Ryoko 
released the lock her bokken had on Azumi&#39;s naginata, her arms 
slowly wrapping themselves around her rival&#39;s waist, her weapon 
still in hand. Azumi&#39;s arms slowly went upwards across Ryoko&#39;s 
shoulders, her hands meeting behind the flame haired girl&#39;s neck. 
They pulled apart for a brief second then came back together, 
gently tugging and pulling at each others lips. Ryoko brought her 
right hand up and pulled at Azumi top, revealing a delicate milky-
white shoulder. After a few more minutes, they stopped their 
intense make out sessions to catch some air. The tops of their 
breasts and their faces were painted a deep scarlet, and their 
lips slightly bruised.

&quot;That was....nice,&quot; Ryoko stated with a bright, loving smile.

&quot;Yes.... it was,&quot; Azumi said also smiling. &quot;I am afraid it&#39;s 
rather late Ryoko. Would you like to stay the rest of the night?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d be delighted,&quot; Ryoko said. &quot;I hope you have some spare sleep 
clothes. I neglected to bring some with me I&#39;m afraid.&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry Ryoko. I don&#39;t think either of us will be needing 
sleep clothes. We won&#39;t have to worry about my parents, there&#39;re 
out tonight,&quot; Azumi said with a lecherous grin.

&quot;Oh really,&quot; said Ryoko with her own roguish grin.

The two then begin to walk slowly back to the Kiribayashi house, 
one arm around each others waist, to indulge themselves in each 
other.

---------------------

Well that took up some time.

Why Ryoko and Azumi you ask?

There just something about these two that just get me really 
steamed up.  They just look extremely sexy together, to me at 
least.

I had originally meant for this to be a small scenario in other to 
start a new topic list on the Shoujo-ai.com forums, but as you can 
see I revised this into a full-length fanfic. I&#39;m not good at 
writing fight scenes, so I spent the least time I could on Ryoko 
and Azumi&#39;s duel, leaving just enough for you to imagine exactly 
what happened.  The part about Ryoko inviting Azumi to lunch was 
of course totally made up.  The outfit Ryoko wears is based upon 
the one she wore during Volumes 5 &amp; 6 of the manga.  And yes I 
know Ryoko starts to fall for Shizuma in the later volumes, so 
just think of this as an AU or Ryoko getting romantically 
sidetracked. Nothing wrong with that, right?

Well that&#39;s it for my first foray into fanfiction.
Hope you all enjoyed it.

Until next time. Peace out.
