<h1>Hello Captain</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../resevil/index.html">Resident Evil</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hellocap.html">Hello Captain</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The smog filled atmosphere of O&#146;Neely&#146;s bar nipped at Rebecca&#146;s wide 
blue eyes as she stirred her orange juice absent mindedly with a straw, 
her gaze travelling from one S.T.A.R.S member to another. Barry Burton, 
a burly, middle aged man, was engaged in animated conversation with a 
terrified looking Brad Vickers, whose eyes darted about anxiously. 
Joseph Frost, Kenneth Sullivan and Enrico Marini were all laughing 
boisterously at Edward Dewey, and, judging by the crude gestures which 
the Bravo pilot was making, it was bound to be a conversation which 
would not interest the young medic.

Men... she groaned inwardly at her colleagues.

Jill Valentine was perched on a bar stool, her long shapely legs crossed 
elegantly. The tall brunette was clad in a brown suede mini-skirt with 
matching boots, and a blue strapless top which flaunted her curves and 
drew ill-concealed admiring glances from the patrons of the bar. 

Taking a long, slow draw from her cigarette which dangled idly from her 
manicured fingers, Valentine looked up languidly towards to door, an 
expression of lazy distain on her face which rapidly melted into one of 
piqued interest as a tall, stocky young man entered. His eyes were a 
deep blue, his swarthy skin, spiked brown hair and muscular figure 
winning him a few sultry looks from a group of girls who were giggling 
round the pool table. Jill&#146;s sullen pout curled upwards in an amused 
smile at his entrance. 

&#147;Chris!&#148; called Jill, flashing her teeth at him.

In his stead followed a sullen looking teenager, who Rebecca judged to 
be around ages with herself, if a little older. She was tall, standing 
shoulder to shoulder with Chris, and of an athletic build, toned arms on 
display which were folded across her chest petulantly. She was clad in a 
skin tight pair of denim trousers, which were ripped at the knees, and a 
red, sleeveless jacket with the slogan &#147;Made in Heaven&#148; emblazoned 
across the back. Her deep blue eyes, determined features and chestnut 
hair, which was tied back from her face loosely, with two strategic 
strands hanging into her eyes, made it clear that she was related to the 
older man.

&#147;Guys,&#148; Chris Redfield announced with a hint of trepidation in his voice 
as the group looked up, &#147;This is my sister, Claire.&#148;

&#147;Yeah...uh...hi,&#148; Claire mumbled, before turning to her brother, &#147;Get me 
a beer, Chris.&#148; She pulled up a stool and slumped into it with an almost 
jaw-dropping lack of grace. Jill sniffed distainfully.

Rebecca turned to her and smiled shyly, &#147;Hi, Claire, it&#146;s nice to...&#148;

&#147;Whatever,&#148; the tall brunette sneered, looking the younger girl up and 
down. Rebecca was petite and slender, with short mousy hair that just 
brushed the nape of her neck. Her eyes were wide and clear, blinking at 
Claire with an expression of mild hurt. She was dressed in a pair of 
worn green cargo trousers and a black t-shirt. The youngest Redfield 
shrugged half-heartedly, feeling a prick of guilt for her brusqueness.

&#147;Yeah...so what&#146;s your name, kiddo?&#148; she enquired roughly.

&#147;R..Rebecca. Rebecca Chambers. I&#146;m the Bravo Medic....&#148; she paused, 
dropping her voice to a conspiratorial whisper, &#147;I&#146;m kinda new.&#148; Claire 
rolled her eyes in an indication that she couldn&#146;t care less as her 
brother approached with a bottle of coke in one hand and a beer in the 
other. He handed her the soft drink.

&#147;Hey bro,&#148; Claire whined, &#147;Where&#146;s my beer?&#148;

He chuckled and ruffled her hair affectionately, &#147;Now what kind of cop 
would I be if I gave alcohol to kids,&#148; he laughed teasingly, &#147;Sorry sis, 
but you and Becks here are on the soft stuff tonight.&#148; 

She shot him a good natured grin, &#147;It was worth a try,&#148; she reflected, 
taking a sip of the cola and grimacing. She turned to Rebecca, 
&#147;So...you&#146;re a little young to be a medic. What&#146;s up with that?&#148;

The younger girl flushed, &#147;Well...I graduated college early and then I 
applied...&#148;

&#147;Steady on!&#148; Claire interupted, &#147;I didn&#146;t ask for your fucking life 
story, Chambers.&#148; Rebecca glared at her.

&#147;There&#146;s no need to be so...&#148; she began.

&#147;Jeez Chambers, chill out.&#148; Claire took some gratification in Rebecca&#146;s 
look of utter puzzlement, before nodding to Jill. &#147;So what&#146;s up with 
Barbie? She looks like she needs laid.&#148;

Rebecca closed her eyes, wishing she was somewhere else, away from this 
crass girl. &#147;That&#146;s Jill...she&#146;s in Alpha team and um...&#148;

Claire raised an eyebrow at the poised woman who was laughing 
enthusiastically at her brother&#146;s wisecracks, &#147;Hmm...nice ass,&#148; Rebecca 
spluttered into her orange juice, certain she had misheard, &#147;So...she 
fucking my bro or what?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t...I don&#146;t know...&#148; Rebecca stammered. Claire snorted.

&#147;You&#146;re so fucking boring, you know that Chambers?&#148; she informed the 
petite medic.

Rebecca scowled, &#147;I&#146;m not, and stop calling me Chambers! My name is...&#148;

&#147;...Chambers.&#148; Claire finished with a maddening grin. She was enjoying 
herself. 

&#147;Oh my god! You are SO annoying!&#148; she snapped petulantly by way of 
reply, unaware that she was taking Claire&#146;s bait. She glared at Chris&#146; 
sister for a few moments, before a voice cut them short.

&#147;Hey Becks!&#148; called out Brad, who was also desperate to escape his 
current conversation, &#147;Are you up for a game of pool?&#148;

&#147;Yo piss off Chickenheart, we&#146;re talking here,&#148; Claire answered on 
Rebecca&#146;s behalf. Chris snapped his head round sharply, glaring at his 
sister. 

&#147;Claire!&#148; he hissed urgently, just out of earshot of Vickers, &#147;Shut the 
fuck up already. Brad doesn&#146;t know we call him that...&#148; The Alpha pilot 
was looking at them with an expression somewhat akin to that of a 
wounded puppy. Claire flipped her middle finger in the air.

&#147;Dude,&#148; Joseph leaned over, frowing, &#147;No offence man, but your 
sister&#146;s...&#148;

Chris sighed, &#147;She&#146;s just a little...rebellious. She&#146;s a good kid 
really.&#148;

While Chris engaged himself in a defence of his sibling to Frost, the 
aforementioned Redfield was sneakily replacing his bottle of beer with 
her own coke. Sniggering, she grabbed the startled Rebecca by the hand 
and dragged her off in the direction of the pool table. 

&#147;Come on, Chambers...&#148;

&#147;Dont call me...&#148; Rebecca stopped abruptly, &#147;Barry!&#148; The two girls had 
almost collided head on with Barry Burton, who was on his way back from 
the restroom. He looked at Claire, his eyes travelling slowly from her 
face...to the beer...to her face...and finally back to the beer again.

He frowned in concern.

&#147;I hope that isn&#146;t Chris&#146; beer...&#148; he informed them, stroking his beard 
thoughtfully.

&#147;Um...&#148; Rebecca shifted her gaze to Claire guility, &#147;We...&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re gonna go play pool, gramps.&#148; Claire told him cockily, &#147;Later.&#148; 
Without another word, she strode over to the table, snatching the cue 
out of the hands of a blonde woman who was wearing too much make up.

&#147;Hey!&#148; the woman said indignantly, &#147;What do you think you&#146;re doing?&#148;

&#147;Sorry lady,&#148; replied Claire flippantly, &#147;Hookers night&#146;s tomorrow. Now 
beat it.&#148; she towered over the blonde menacingly, who spent a moment or 
two weighing up her options before scurrying off. Rebecca groaned. 

&#147;You can&#146;t just...&#148; she began, but Claire was determined not to let her 
finish a sentence all evening.

&#147;Shut it, Chambers, and set the balls up,&#148; she ordered, chalking up her 
cue.

Over at the bar, Jill smiled flirtatiously at Chris, &#147;Say, those two 
seem to be getting on really well,&#148; she simpered.

&#147;Yeah,&#148; Chris began reluctantly, taking a swig from his bottle before 
coughing in surprise. &#147;Claire...!&#148; He glared at his sister furiously. 
Chris Redfield was beginning to think that perhaps bringing his sister 
to his work night out was not such an inspired idea after all....

-

Jill pressed her hand onto Chris&#146; thigh soothingly. &#147;Leave her 
Chris...take the night off from being babysitter, and come play with the 
adults tonight...&#148; she breathed, looking into his eyes. Chris looked at 
her with a puzzled expression on his face, wondering if he was being 
propositioned. Brad, overhearing, sniffed derisively at Jill&#146;s femme 
fatal attempts.

Over at the pool table, Claire was kicking Rebecca&#146;s arse, and lost no 
time in reminding her of this every time she potted a ball with languid 
ease. 

&#147;You really fucking suck at this, Chambers,&#148; Claire was telling her, 
unaware that the reason Rebecca was playing so poorly was because she 
was utterly terrified of Redfield&#146;s younger sibling. However, after one 
derogatory comment too many, the STARS medic was slowly becoming rather 
irate.

&#147;WILL YOU PLEASE STOP CALLING ME THAT!&#148; Rebecca screamed, her temper 
finally snapping. The bar fell silent as everyone turned to look at her. 
There were a few incredulous snickers as the older members of the 
special tactics and rescue squad frowned at their youngest recruit. 
Chris buried his head in his hands.

Claire looked at Rebecca, who was flushed with annoyance. She cocked her 
head to one side, thoughtfully, &#147;You know, Chambers, you&#146;re kinda cute 
when you&#146;re angry...&#148; she grinned at her.

The younger girl glared back at her, the tips of her ears burning. &#147;What 
is your problem, Claire?&#148;

Redfield shrugged, &#147;I&#146;m just bored, y&#146;know...&#148; she said, looking Rebecca 
square in the eye, &#147;I only came to Racoon City for the holidays, and 
Chris has spent the whole time so far chasing after that bit of skirt. I 
mean, I&#146;m his goddamn sister, and I never see him. You&#146;d think he&#146;d 
actually wanna spend some time with me...&#148; she huffed petulantly, 
leaning against the pool table.

&#147;So essentially,&#148; Rebecca paused thoughfully, &#147;You&#146;re being horrible to 
everyone to try and get Chris&#146; attention? What are you like five years 
old or something?&#148; she snapped.

&#147;Shut the fuck up Chambers,&#148; she glowered sullenly, &#147;He said we were 
gonna hang out, do fun stuff like soup up my Harley or go to a football 
match. I mean, for fuck&#146;s sake, does he really think I want to be stuck 
in a redneck bar with a bunch of cops?&#148;

&#147;Well I don&#146;t exactly want to be here either!&#148; the medic spluttered 
indignantly, &#147;You don&#146;t need to take it out on me!&#148;

Claire ignored her &#147;She&#146;s not that fucking hot, y&#146;know?&#148; 

&#147;Jill?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, Valentine. I mean, sure she&#146;s got a nice set of tits and all, but 
if he wanted to empty his sack he could just go to a hooker. It would 
save him the effort...&#148;

Rebecca looked at her in confusion, &#147;Claire...I think Chris actually 
really likes her. They get on really well in work, and she seems to care 
about him...&#148; she began.

&#147;Oh sure, Chambers, he likes her for her wonderful personality,&#148; Claire 
interupted sarcastically, &#147;Men are all the fucking same, even my 
brother.&#148;

Rebecca sighed. This troubled teenager was going to get old fast. 
Despite being the younger of the two, she felt certain that she was 
years ahead of Claire in maturity when she said, &#147;Listen Claire, I think 
we should call a truce. Since neither of us actually want to be here, 
how about you stop being horrible to me, and we try and make the best of 
a bad night?&#148; Claire did not reply, &#147;...I&#146;ll even let you call me 
Chambers...&#148; Rebecca wheedled.

Redfield grinned, relentingly, &#147;All right, Chambers, you got yourself a 
deal.&#148; she conceeded, feeling a little better.

&#147;So you&#146;ll drop the rebellious teen act?&#148; Rebecca persisted, &#147;Cause you 
know, I think you&#146;re just going to upset your brother, and...&#148;

Claire laughed at the anxious girl, &#147;All right, all right. Relax, 
Chambers, I&#146;ll be on my best behaviour here on in...&#148; 

Rebecca smiled shyly, &#147;Just making sure...&#148;

&#147;So...&#148; Claire searched for a new topic of conversation, &#147;What&#146;s it like 
being a commando STARS member? You got a gun?&#148;

Rebecca nodded, &#147;They gave me a gun and a bullet proof vest and 
everything. It&#146;s so cool...!&#148; Being eighteen years old and a fresh faced 
young college graduate, she was rather more excited about these new 
accessories than your average new recruit to the police force might have 
been.

Her companion nodded approvingly, &#147;I really want a gun. It would be 
swell, I could point it at stuff, and shoot small animals and...&#148; she 
stopped, &#147;...um yeah. Chris won&#146;t let me get one.&#148;

Chambers giggled wildly, &#147;I&#146;m not surprised. You should just join the 
force if you want one so much. Or, you know, you could...like rob a cop 
car or something?&#148; she joked.

&#147;For fucks sake, Chambers, it&#146;s not like they leave guns lying about in 
glove compartments,&#148; Claire snorted, &#147;Yeah, I used to want to be a cop, 
just like my brother. And before that it was the Air Force, &#145;til Chris 
got his ass kicked out.&#148;

Rebecca&#146;s eyes widened, &#147;I didn&#146;t know that.&#148;

Claire nodded, &#147;Oh yeah, it&#146;s no big secret. He&#146;s got a problem with 
authority,&#148; she grinned, &#147;It runs in the family.&#148;

&#147;I noticed,&#148; the short haired girl smiled. &#147;Chris can be a real 
smart-ass with Captain Wesker, sometimes...&#148;

Claire studied her face intently, as Rebecca began to tell an animated 
story about something Chris and Wesker had clashed over. She could feel 
her grumpy mood dissolving in the face of the other girl&#146;s enthusiasm 
and sincerity. 

She&#146;s so...nice. Claire mused, Pretty too, in a pixie-ish kind of way. 
Not my usual type by a long shot though. Bet she&#146;s straight, with some 
geeky med student boyfriend or something...

&#147;...and...and then Chris told Wesker he could kiss his ass, and everyone 
was like &#145;oh my god&#146; cause Wesker&#146;s like totally anal and...&#148; 

Claire flashed her white teeth, &#147;Yeah, that&#146;s my bro.&#148; she drawled, &#147;So, 
Chambers, tell me about yourself.&#148; She leaned against the pool cue 
casually.

Rebecca looked at her suspiciously, &#147;Um...well, I&#146;ve got a degree in 
biochemistry and...um...I like netball and um...ice cream...&#148; she 
faltered.

&#147;Boyfriend?&#148; 

Rebecca shook her head, &#147;I...uh...&#148; she paused, &#147;I don&#146;t really have 
time to date...&#148; she lied. &#147;You?&#148;

Claire chuckled, &#147;Boyfriend? No way.&#148; she said vehemently. She was 
rewarded with a nervous giggle. The tall girl looked at her with renewed 
interest.

-

Over at the bar, the STARS members were growing restless. Joseph wanted 
to go to a club, Chris and Jill wanted to stay where they were, and Brad 
wanted to go to his bed. A rather heated arguement about the merits of 
different firearms was breaking out between Barry and Forrest.

Jill leaned over and whispered into Chris&#146; ear, &#147;What say we go back to 
your place,&#148; she told him in her best sultry voice, fluttering her 
lashes seductively, &#147;...maybe we could get a little privacy there?&#148; she 
continued, in case her intentions hadn&#146;t been clear enough from the fact 
that her hand was on his thigh.

Chris gulped. Raising his eyes to the heavens in supplications of 
gratitude, his stomach began to churn wildly. &#147;Ah...sure Jill. That 
would be great!&#148; he stammered enthusiastically, before remembering his 
little sister. &#147;Damn it!&#148; he hissed. 

&#147;What was that?&#148; Jill purred. 

&#147;Uh...um...nothing. Could you wait here just a sec?&#148; he winced. This was 
going to be hell. 

Approaching the pool table where Rebecca was deep in conversation with 
his sister, he reached out with trepidation and tapped Claire on the 
shoulder. &#147;Uh...Claire?&#148; he asked nervously. He knew what his sister was 
like when she was angry.

She whirled round, &#147;What?&#148; 

&#147;I...uh...I got a little problem, sis. See, Jill just asked if she could 
come back to my place, and...uh...&#148; Rebecca began giggling.

&#147;Oh my god!&#148; she let out a muffled squeal, &#147;You and Jill!&#148;

&#147;Shut up Chambers,&#148; interjected Claire, &#147;So let me get this 
straight...you want me to get outta the apartment, so you can get into 
Jill&#146;s panties?&#148; she snarled, furious, &#147;Yeah...thanks a lot bro!&#148;

&#147;Aw come on, Clairey...&#148; he wheedled, &#147;I know I said we were gonna hang 
out, but I can&#146;t just...I mean, it&#146;s Jill. I&#146;ve liked her for months, 
and I really think....&#148; 

&#147;Where the hell am I supposed to go while you two are fucking?&#148; Claire 
demanded.

&#147;Um...&#148; Chris paused, searching around him for inspiration. His eyes 
fell on Rebecca, who turned pale, &#147;...I got it! You can crash at 
Becca&#146;s! &#148; he grinned disarmingly. Rebecca looked as though she was 
feeling rather ill. &#147;That ok with you Becks?&#148; he added.

&#147;Well...um...not really...&#148; she began.

&#147;...it&#146;s settled then!&#148; Chris beamed, &#147;Well, you two have fun, and I&#146;ll 
pick you up tomorrow sis,&#148; he said cheerfully. 

&#147;Woah! Hold on there, cassanova! If you&#146;re fobbing me off so you can get 
laid, you better do me a favour in return...&#148; his sister smirked, &#147;You 
gotta get us some booze or something, man.&#148;

Chris grimaced, looking about thoughtfully, before assenting, &#147;Fine.&#148; he 
sighed, rushing back over to Jill. &#147;Claire&#146;s going to stay with Rebecca, 
so I&#146;m just going to see them out.&#148; she smiled at him knowingly, as he 
continued, &#147;I&#146;ll be back in two seconds. Stay there. Please.&#148; 

He scampered out of the bar with the two teenage girls in tow.

-

&#147;Right,&#148; Chris emerged with from the off-license with his brows 
furrowed, &#147;I got you some vodka. Will that shut you up, Clairey?&#148; 

&#147;Tut, tut,&#148; she wagged a finger at him, mockingly, &#147;Buying alcohol for 
minors. Some cop you are...&#148;

&#147;This better be the best damn fuck I ever had...&#148; he muttered under his 
breath jokingly. He turned to leave, but Claire gave him a pointed 
cough. 

&#147;Ahem, dear brother, I think you&#146;re forgetting something...&#148; she told 
him.

&#147;What?&#148; he snapped.

&#147;Cab money. You don&#146;t want poor defenceless me wandering the streets 
alone.&#148; she grinned at him. With a heartfelt sigh, he reached into his 
pocket and thrust some notes into her outstretched palm. 

&#147;Happy?&#148;

&#147;Deleriously. Enjoy Valentine.&#148; she retorted, before turning to Rebecca. 
&#147;You got your own place, or do you still live with mommy?&#148; 

Rebecca shook her head, &#147;My parents are dead.&#148; she stated simply. Claire 
looked embarassed.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry. Uh...my mom died too, when I was young. Car crash. We never 
knew my dad...&#148; she mumbled, contrite, &#147;I didn&#146;t mean to...&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s ok,&#148; Rebecca smiled soothingly, &#147;Oh! A cab!&#148; she pointed to the 
taxicar which had appeared nearby. Claire hailed it with gusto, and it 
pulled over. The pair clambered in the back seat, and Rebecca gave her 
address to the driver, while Claire waved at her brother through the 
window.

-

Rebecca fumbled with her keys in the lock, while Claire tapped her foot 
impatiently. &#147;Hurry up Chambers, I&#146;m freezing!&#148;

The hallway to the block of apartments was extremely bleak, with 
splashes of vomit lining the stairs, and grafitti spray painted on the 
walls. Claire kicked at a beer can while Rebecca forced the key into the 
lock. Eventually it clicked and the younger girl smiled triumphantly. 
&#147;It&#146;s tempermental,&#148; she explained.

She lead the way into a spartan, but well ordered apartment, which 
Claire reflected was in sharp contrast to the messy state of her own 
college halls of residence. She cast a critical eye about the room.

&#147;Chambers...?&#148; she asked, slowly, &#147;Where&#146;s your tv...?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t have one,&#148; came the reply. Claire gasped incredulously. 

&#147;What the hell are we going to do all night if you don&#146;t have a TV?&#148; she 
demanded, her eyes wide in shock.

&#147;Um...well usually I read a book then go to bed early...&#148; Rebecca began. 

&#147;Oh...my...god,&#148; Claire held her hand to her head in mock melodrama, &#147;I 
need to sit down.&#148; She flopped into the worn looking couch, clutching 
the brown paper back her brother had given her, which contained the 
alcohol. Pulling out the bottle of vodka, she examined it, &#147;Chambers, 
get some glasses while I put some music on.&#148; she ordered with a nod.

Rebecca gave her a bemused smile, &#147;Yes ma&#146;am.&#148;

When she reappeared from the kitchen, two glasses and a bottle of cola 
in hand, Claire was sifting through her CD collection. &#147;I cannot believe 
you own THIS,&#148; she said, holding up a Celine Dion record.

Rebecca blushed, &#147;I liked Titanic when I was younger, ok?&#148; she said 
defensively as she poured a measure of vodka into a cracked glass. &#147;Say 
when...&#148; she said as she moved to top it up with coke.

&#147;Woah there Chambers!&#148; Claire cried out, &#147;I&#146;m not putting a mixer in. 
That&#146;s for pussies.&#148; she grinned, downing the contents of the glass 
dramatically, without flinching. &#147;Try it.&#148; she ordered, pouring Rebecca 
a healthy measure of spirit.

Rebecca hesitated for a minute, then scowled defiantly at Claire and 
gulped the burning liquid down. After a few seconds her cheeks turned 
red, and she began to cough and gag, screwing up her face. When it 
subsided, she was surprised to find that her stomach felt warm and 
glowy. She smiled through watery eyes.

&#147;See,&#148; Claire told her with a surprising gentleness, &#147;Alcohol is good. 
Let&#146;s do more shots!&#148;

-

Half a bottle later, and the two girls were lying on the floor giggling 
inanely at something which, to be fair, wasn&#146;t particularly funny. 
Rebecca was on her back, gazing up at the ceiling, which was spinning a 
litte, while Claire lay on her side, her ruddy cheek pressed against the 
cheap cold linoleum.

&#147;So...&#148; Rebecca slurred at the other girl, &#147;How....how come you&#146;re such 
a bitch?!&#148; she snorted as though she had said something tremendously 
amusing.

Claire sat up and looked at the teenager with a solemn look on her rosy 
face, &#147;I...I dunno, Chambers. It&#146;s...just...you know. Chris is this 
big-ass cop guy and he never had time for me anymore...college sucks, 
everyone&#146;s so fucking lame and narrow minded, y&#146;know? I wish someone 
would sit up and fucking take notice. Look out world, Claire Fucking 
Redfield&#146;s here,&#148; she smiled wryly.

Rebecca giggled, then fell silent abruptly. &#147;I think I get it...I guess 
my way of coping was just to study more...graduate early...fuck them 
all, cause I&#146;m leaving them all behind...&#148; she said sadly, &#147;We should be 
friends, Claire...we could stick together and...and...um...what was I 
talking about?&#148; she slurred.

Claire grinned, an expression of geniune affection for the other girl, 
brought on only in part by the consumption of alcohol. &#147;You know 
something, Becks...&#148; she began, but was cut short by a delighted squeal.

&#147;You called me Becks! Not Chambers!&#148;

Claire sighed indulgently, &#147;No need to have a fucking party, Becks.&#148; she 
said, half laughing at the younger girl&#146;s enthusiasm.

&#147;Claire?&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;How come you&#146;re not super popular in college. I mean, 
you&#146;re...like...cool, and you&#146;ve got a bike and um...you&#146;re pretty 
and...&#148; Rebecca raised herself up on her elbows, looking Claire straight 
in the eye boldly.

&#147;It&#146;s complicated, Becks.&#148;

&#147;I bet it&#146;s not. I bet you&#146;re really popular and all the boys want to go 
on dates with you and...and ...&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m gay.&#148;

There. She had said it. Blurted it out in fact, but she was drunk and 
she didn&#146;t care. She looked away from Rebecca, as the room was eclipsed 
in stunned silence. 

Eventually, &#147;Wow...&#148; Chambers looked at the older girl who refused to 
meet her gaze, her face a picture of curiosity and surprise, &#147;I never 
knew a gay before.&#148;

At this Claire turned round and exploded, &#147;I&#146;m not a fucking circus act, 
Chambers!&#148; Hurt, Rebecca lowered her eyes.

&#147;Um...I&#146;m sorry. I...I...um...I don&#146;t really like boys that much either, 
they&#146;re always mean to me, if that helps?&#148;

There was no reply, as Claire poured another measure of vodka into the 
two glasses, downing hers with an expression of bitter determination. 
Rebecca followed suit, scrunching up her eyes as she swallowed.

They lay there on the floor for a while, side by side in silence. 
Rebecca closed her eyes, her lips curled up in a dreamy half smile. 
&#147;Alcohol is good...&#148; she pondered. 

&#147;It is indeed,&#148; agreed Claire wisely.

&#147;Claire...what&#146;s it like?&#148; Rebecca asked, with that little impish smile.

&#147;What?&#148; came the slow reply.

&#147;You know...being with a girl and...stuff.&#148; Rebecca giggled nervously. 
Claire sat up and she followed suit.

&#147;It&#146;s...nice. Soft and warm and...well...&#148; she struggled to find the 
words in her inebriated state, &#147;...it just feels more...right. Like 
that&#146;s how things are &#145;sposed to be.&#148; She waved her hand vaguely.

&#147;Oh...&#148; the short haired girl sighed despondantly, &#147;Sounds...swell.&#148;

&#147;Anyway,&#148; Claire piped up in a valiant attempt to change the subject, 
&#147;Do you think my brother and Jill are fucking right now?&#148;

&#147;Kiss me.&#148;

Claire looked up, startled. &#147;What did you just say?&#148;

&#147;Kiss me. I want...um...I want to see what it&#146;s like...?&#148; she trailed 
off lamely.

The Redfield girl frowned angrily, &#147;For fucks sake, Becks, you can&#146;t 
just...I mean...geez. No. I&#146;m not going to make out with you so you can 
have some little fucking experiment. What the hell do you take me for?&#148;

Rebecca looked away miserably, &#147;Fuck, Claire, I&#146;m sorry. I don&#146;t know 
what came over me...I&#146;ve had too much to drink and...&#148; she stood up with 
a stagger, holding onto the wall for balance, &#147;...I should go to bed...&#148;

All at once Claire was on her feet. She grabbed the petite girl by her 
wrist, impulsively.

&#147;Becks...&#148; she began.

&#147;I...&#148;

&#147;Shut up Chambers...&#148; she commanded gently, encircling her waist with 
one lithe arm. Rebecca smiled nervously, unsure of herself as Claire 
pulled her in closer to her, raising her up on her tiptoes, so her face 
was level with the taller girl&#146;s. The young medic could feel her 
heartbeat pounding in her ears as she raised her large blue eyes to meet 
piercing deep cerulean hues. Redfield leaned in quickly, almost 
agressively, their lips pressing together tightly. 

Rebecca&#146;s eyes flew open in surprise, a faint blush staining her cheeks. 
Claire reached round with her other hand, running it up the nape of her 
neck, twining her fingers in the tousled short hair, gently tugging on 
the errant strands . Trembling, Rebecca closed her eyes and tried to 
relax, parting her lips a little, as the tip of Claire&#146;s tongue touched 
her own. Tentatively at first, she returned the kiss, drinking in the 
other girl&#146;s taste, her smell, the softness of her skin. 

Rebecca clung tightly to Claire, pressing against her with an eager 
urgency as the kiss became more passionate. The two teenagers were 
utterly lost in one another. Even Claire, the more experienced by a long 
way, was forced to admit that there was a real, undeniable chemistry 
pervading between the two.

Rebecca was lost, her spirit soaring with the heady giddiness of 
sensations new. Nothing she had ever experienced before had given her 
such a wildly dizzy feeling in the pit of her stomach. It was as though 
she had discovered a secret, silent treasure that had just been awoken 
inside of her, that was flying through her blood at a million miles per 
hour, tiny particles of light and air that were bursting to break free 
and scream at the top of their voices that Rebecca Chambers was free and 
happy and alive!

And then all was still. 

The floodgates opened, and she could breathe again. Only now, as Claire 
gently kissed her on the nose, she could see the world through a film of 
lust and vodka and magic and trembling, rain soaked moonlight which 
danced madly through her hair, her ecstatic features with those huge 
saucers of eyes that shone so brightly. 

Wrapped up in one another, their eyes locked resolutely, each viewing 
the other with solemn bemusement, they stood against the wall of that 
dingy apartment for what could have been a second or an eternity for all 
either one cared.

With a sharp intake of breath, Rebecca set her jaw with a determined 
look that made Claire want to giggle. The Bravo medic began to kiss her 
again, urgently, pulling feebly at her red sleeveless gillet while her 
lips met with the soft skin of Claire&#146;s neck. Undoing the zipper, she 
let the top fall over toned limbs, falling discarded onto the linoleum, 
revealing a black sports bra. Claire smiled sardonically as she tugged 
at the bottom of Rebecca&#146;s black top, drawing it smoothly over her head, 
ruffling her aleady messy hair. She stood in heart-tugging disarray, 
clad in her plain white bra with her hair flopping errantly into her 
flushed face, looking up at Redfield with those soulful puppy-dog eyes.

&#147;Jesus, Chambers...&#148; breathed Claire, before she was silenced by another 
kiss, almost violent in its intensity. She stumbled backwards, but 
Rebecca persisted, clinging on to her as she held them together in a 
resolute embrace. With an expert fluency, Claire laid back onto the worn 
couch, before sliding wantonly onto the floor with a gentle thud. In a 
flash, Rebecca was on top of her, straddling her playfully, as she toyed 
with the front clasp of her bra, a teasing smirk on her youthful 
features. 

Reaching up, Claire ran a finger lightly from her waistband, up her 
stomach and then, suddenly, hooked her fingers into Rebecca&#146;s bra, 
pulling her forward with a firm yank, dislodging the clasp in the 
process, freeing the younger girl&#146;s chest. Claire cupped one of the pert 
breasts in her hand, eliciting a surprised squeal from her partner. 
Leaning over the brunette slowly, she fumbled for a few moments with the 
sports bra, finally pulling it free with a triumphant smile, dangling it 
from her index finger for a few seconds, before Claire roughly encircled 
her waist with both arms and yanked her down, rolling her playfully onto 
the ground. Their lips met once more, tongues intertwining in a heated 
duel.

Slowly, the tapered tips of Claire&#146;s fingers made their way to Rebecca&#146;s 
waistband, undoing the button at the top and pulling the zipper down 
before the girl had time to react. Rebecca gasped inaudibly as her 
trousers came loose, revealing white cotton panties with tiny bows at 
each hip. She kicked them off, almost obediently. Claire grinned and 
pulled her own denims off with a flourish. Her black hotpants contrasted 
sharply against Rebecca&#146;s girlish choice of underwear, and she smiled 
wickedly. 

Claire ran her hands over the skin on her partner&#146;s taught stomach, her 
hands skimming lightly downwards to stroke her inner thigh with the 
edges of her fingernail, as she leaned over and kissed Rebecca on the 
forehead possesively. With a surrepticious, almost sly movement, she 
slipped her hand between Rebecca&#146;s legs, eliciting a shocked &#147;oh&#148; from 
her which degenerated into a murmur of happiness and arousal. Satisfied 
with her reaction, Claire confidently pulled at the elastic, removing 
the cotton undergarment quickly. 

She traced her fingertip up the inside of the teenager&#146;s leg once more, 
keeping her back firmly pressed against the cold floor with one hand, 
which was cupped around the pale white flesh of her right breast, 
kneading roughly at it every so often, causing Rebecca to whimper in 
confusion. When her hand reached the top of her thigh, she grasped it, 
pulling her limp legs apart. When Rebecca&#146;s limbs had relaxed, she 
slipped a teasing finger between her thighs, sending a jolt through the 
inexperienced girl. Finding the tender flesh there to be swollen and a 
little moist, she began to stroke her in circular motions, and was 
rewarded with feverish moans. As her movements grew less gentle and more 
passionate, she slipped her finger inside the girl, who began to squirm 
with embarassed pleasure and mild discomfort.

Rebecca could feel a burning, prickling sensation welling up from 
unknown reserves in the pit of her stomach, as Claire continued to probe 
until she brushed ever so lightly against a spot which caused her to 
buck forwards and cry out softly. With an almost animalistic grunt, 
Rebecca began to thrash against Claire&#146;s hand as the pressure began to 
build up from inside her, a rushing wave that threatened to drown her. 
Beads of sweat began to form on her flushed brow, as the burning tide 
rose up in her like a fever, causing every nerve ending on her skin to 
tingle and prickle like she was filling up with white-hot ice, the 
pounding and crashing getting louder and louder like an orchestral 
maneouver that has no beginning, middle or end, only now, as the room 
swam in and out of focus and she began to see stars in the corners of 
her eyes until her petite body could no longer withstand such merciless 
teasing and began to cave in, inching it&#146;s way over the edge until, with 
one god almighty explosion of a fall, which was almost celestial in its 
magnitude, pent up as it was in that oh so delicate frame as it fought 
desperately to burst out in one carnal scream...the planets collided for 
Miss Rebecca Chambers.
