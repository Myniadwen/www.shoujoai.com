<h1>Silent Night</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../resevil/index.html">Resident Evil</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rpgstoryman.html">Ima Doofus</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was like watching a bad horror movie. The seconds ticked by 
visibly, as the frames of her mind skipped. The green creature slid 
towards her. It had horrible claws, thick and scaly green skin, and a 
little nub of a head filled with hideous fangs. It was like a skinned 
gorilla almost, yet it showed no remorse for the deed it was about to 
do.

Inch by inch, frame by frame, she watched it near her. Her handgun 
readied in front, not as a weapon, but as a shield. There was not 
enough ammo in her gun to scratch its hard carapace. She cowered in 
the corner, wedged between a bookshelf and a broken door, pondering 
her impending demise. The frames skipped slower and slower and time 
its self almost stopped.

She remembered the next part vividly. The door opened. There was a 
masculine yell, and many a shotgun shell was emptied into the creature 
before her. It stopped dead and fell a few feet in front of her, a 
small pool of blood staining the knee of her pants. She shakily stood 
up, and embraced her savior with no question.

But that did not happen. The creature neared further until she could 
feel its hot breath on her face, its claws poised to rip her frail 
body limb from limb. It then proceeded to do so, as Rebecca seemingly 
left her body. She floated over, watching her body being ravaged by 
the creature with no one around to save her. 

The creature then turned around, having finished playing with the 
body. It almost sensed her essence there, watching her own demise. 
There where no more frames in her mind, as the next scene began to 
play out. It neared her again, and with no legs to flee, she simply 
sat there with death pending just as she had done before not five 
minutes ago. Its mouth opened, and had soon enveloped her peripheral 
vision. Then all was black.

&quot;Rebecca Chambers, come in.&quot; the radio buzzed. Soon she was free from 
the hunter&#39;s jaws and in her bed, sitting up with her now drenched 
T-shirt weighing down on her shoulders. The tomboyish girl sighed, 
masking her terrible fears as she has done for all her life. &quot;Rebecca 
Chambers, S.T.A.R.S, come in.&quot;

She picked up the radio and answered. She was with Jill Valentine 
stationed on an island where Umbrella activity was believed to be 
taking place. She had survived this all before and had only taken the 
assignment because she believed that her young mind was now impervious 
to fear, the thought that her dream had just contradicted.

She was not invincible. She was a kid. A scared, misguided kid that 
had seen things and done things that would make grown men break down 
and cry. She had survived things and terror that words alone cannot 
describe and she was alive sitting in a bed, shaky after a nightmare.

Why? Why had she seen and done these things? Why her? She sobbed. She 
seemed to have an ethereal sense about her mental ailments. Depression 
was what she dealt with the majority of the time. But her odd sense 
somehow allowed her to silence it. It seemed that if she was aware of 
the disorder, it ceased to exist.

But she could not simply `think away&#39; life. How would she ever make 
it? Who would she marry, or rather, what kind of man would marry her? 
She was an emotionally scarred kid. Her job was to kill what has 
already died. How could she explain this to a husband, or much less a 
child? 

She needed someone who had experienced this before. She could be with 
this person and live happily ever after with them. The problem was the 
fact that there where only two men. Billy Coen and Chris Redfield, 
both of them uninterested in a kid such as her. They had become a 
father figure, or a big brother, or whatever older male family figures 
the situation had called for. Everything but a possible love interest.

Another sob, before she washed her depression back away and sank back 
into her `work persona.&#39; 

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Rebecca Chambers, you are to move in tomorrow morning. Over.&quot;

Tomorrow morning? She glanced at the clock, noticing it was 3 AM. Why 
in the hell where they calling her at 3 AM about tomorrow morning? She 
had lost twenty or so valuable minutes of sleep due to their 
incompetence.

Her dream slowly crept back into her mind and before she was overcome 
with the childish fear that had defiled her mind earlier, she realized 
she wasn&#39;t tired. She feared sleep.

Sleep was the one thing that struck her very core with such an 
unearthly terror that she felt it. The zombies, leeches, and whatever 
other mutated creatures that she had returned to the grave had left a 
much greater scar than the one on her right arm. One in her mind. In 
her nightmares.

Close brushes with death are only truly realized when one is asleep, 
and their brain is able to convey the severity. Only then is true fear 
realized. True fear, something Rebecca Chambers did not enjoy dealing 
with. Times like these where all too common for the young girl to 
bear. She needed someone to talk to. No one would listen to a girl 
whining about bad dreams, much less one who had experienced such 
horrible things that no one else had, or should, for that matter. 

Her mind drifted, and a sudden rush of insanity fled through her mind. 
Suicide suddenly sounded much better than it had the day before, and 
this pattern had been in work since she met an Ex-Con on an abandoned 
train. The handgun rested on her nightstand. Quick, painless, and 
simple. 

She ran outside. Away from her gun, and away from anything sharp. She 
embraced the cold, non-lethal rain that was falling from the sky, as 
she sat and thought on the porch to her house. There was no doubt that 
her twisted mind could come up with no less than a hundred ways to end 
her life painlessly just on this porch, or just with this chair that 
she sat in.

The very fact that she could think of a way made her angrier with 
herself, feeding the fire growing inside. The fact that his made her 
angry made her angry. She started breathing violently, and got up from 
the chair. She felt dirty. She had to go. She had to leave. She had to 
protect herself from her own defiled mind. She was having a nervous 
breakdown.

There was a flash of lightning, and in the distance she saw the 
outline of a figure. A green, scaly, clawed figure in the distance 
that had haunted her mind earlier. It lowered onto its haunches and 
jumped into a vicious run towards her. The malevolence in the air 
chilled the girl to her very essence, yet she stood there and embraced 
what was coming. She saw it nearing ever so quickly, its outline 
becoming more and more detailed. A flash of lightning reflected off a 
claw. Rebecca turned around and began sprinting away, her feet sinking 
into the muddy earth.

She couldn&#39;t see where she was going. Pitch black, all she knew was 
where the grunting behind her was coming from, and she needed to go 
the opposite direction. A rock or stump or some foreign object got in 
her way, sending her flying forward and landing on solid ground. She 
figured the beast was now upon her, and simply let it end. A wince, a 
wait, and then she propped herself up on her arms.

She blinked. She was on an unfamiliar porch. She was soaking wet, 
wearing a white T-shirt that now left nothing to the imagination and a 
pair of baggy pajama type pants that followed the suit. She knocked on 
the door, thinking that her salvation lied behind.

She heard a shotgun being readied beyond the door, some rustling, and 
then a muffled cry of `Oh my God!&#39;

&quot;Rebecca!&quot;

A sob answered, and the young girl collapsed into the arms of Jill 
Valentine. Jill had been through the same ordeal, experienced the same 
traumatic symptoms of whatever ailment caused by the massive amount of 
disturbing images that had passed through their minds. She was the one 
that understood. 

Jill closed the door, shutting out the rain. Rebecca was soaking wet 
and scantly clad, literally leaving nothing at all to the imagination. 
&quot;Do you want some...dry clothes?&quot; Jill asked, trying to get her out of 
this strangely erotic position. It troubled her that Rebecca was in 
such a situation, and yet it was arousing her.

A light nod, Rebecca&#39;s eyes had closed. She continued to sob lightly. 
The girl has had a nervous break down or something to that effect, 
unable to tell right from wrong, white from black, or anything else 
really in her confused state. She just knew that her clothes where wet 
and cold, and she wanted dry warm ones.

Jill ran to get a robe and some underwear for her, while Rebecca sat 
at the rounded kitchen table that Jill ate her lonely meals at. It 
made no sense to her why they where lodged separately. Loneliness was 
a painfully common emotion for the lot of them.

She returned with Rebecca&#39;s new clothes, and she started to peel off 
her wet shirt. Jill turned around, embarrassed at first. The shirt hit 
the ground rather hard with a definite `squish&#39; sound. Jill thought 
for a moment and judged that she had finished dressing by now, but did 
not turn around. She didn&#39;t want to risk seeing her and being plagued 
with more thoughts and questions than she already was. A naked, wet 
Rebecca was not what her mind needed at the time.

An awkwardly false cough was enough for Jill to realize that Rebecca 
was done. She had the robe pulled as tight as she could, apparently 
trying to warm up and having a lack of regard for what was left to the 
imagination of on-lookers. 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, honey?&quot; Jill asked, putting on a motherly tone and 
tearing her gaze from the younger girl&#39;s chest. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Rebecca&#39;s voice became eerily stoic, losing all of her 
emotion and tone to it.

&quot;Why where you outside running around? It&#39;s raining...&quot; Jill asked 
caringly, though she thought she sounded like she was pointing out 
flaws. She stammered to correct her self, but instead raised a hand to 
wipe some rain drops off of the girl&#39;s face that had fallen from her 
hair; a gesture to show that she meant no harm.

&quot;To get away from anything I could end it with. I don&#39;t trust myself 
any more. Other people don&#39;t trust me either...I&#39;m so lonely sometimes 
I just can&#39;t know what to do...&quot; She said, and as she finished, her 
emotions had returned. Water formed in her eyes, and she shut them 
quickly, and fell into Jill&#39;s arms from the other side of the table.

Jill moved her chair over to make it less awkward and opted to make 
some coffee for her to help calm down. Rebecca obliged, and kissed her 
on the cheek. Jill froze, half out of the chair. She looked down at 
Rebecca, who had her eyes closed and had her head hung down. The tight 
robe, the wet hair, Rebecca was damn good looking.

Jill got up totally and went for the coffee. &quot;It&#39;ll take about ten 
minutes, OK?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine.&quot;

Jill smiled; glad she could make the girl happy. She put in the filter 
and the coffee and started the machine. She copped a glance back at 
the younger girl, who was still staring at the floor. Jill licked her 
lips. But she just couldn&#39;t take advantage of her in this position, it 
just wasn&#39;t right. If Rebecca wanted it, though, there was no way in 
hell she could deny her.

She went and sat back down, wanting badly to console the girl but 
decided just to put her hand on hers and wait for the coffee. She 
smiled, and Rebecca finally looked up.

&quot;Thank you, you pretty much saved my life, you know.&quot; 

Jill smiled again. &quot;What are friends for?&quot;

Rebecca faked a smile. She still wasn&#39;t any better mentally, but she 
was warm and safe from the dangers that lurked outside. She loathed 
the mission that was forthcoming, though she knew Jill would be there 
for her. She needed out of this nightmare. She needed love. She 
needed...Jill...

Her gaze returned the floor. Though she had long since stopped caring 
about her sexuality in general, she had always seen herself with a 
man. But if she didn&#39;t care, why was she stopping herself? Of all the 
things she feared, rejection was not one of them. She had been passed 
around like a rag doll most of her life, and adding another tally to 
the chart didn&#39;t mean all that much to her.

Why hesitate? Go for it! Rebecca&#39;s mind raced, and she bit her lower 
lip. The coffee machine made a noise indicating that it was halfway 
done. It wasn&#39;t exactly now or never, but she could never forgive 
herself for not trying. How could she get over her issues with no 
support? Sure, Jill could help on the sidelines as a good friend, but 
she needed someone to be emotionally involved with.

But you could be emotionally involved with no sex, right? Rebecca 
glanced up at Jill. Her glowing face, a body nothing shy of 
perfection, and the exact personality she needed. How could sex not be 
part of it? Another light on the coffee machine turned on, signifying 
three quarters of its completion.

&quot;Good, it&#39;s almost done. You OK?&quot;

&quot;Oh, good, yeah...&quot;

Jill smiled happily, completely oblivious to the battle being waged in 
her mind. Her lower lip was wearing thin, and she had to make a 
decision. She wasn&#39;t afraid of rejection, and Jill was older and would 
probably understand what is going on with her. She certainly wouldn&#39;t 
shun her away for an advance, especially in her condition. 

&quot;It&#39;s done.&quot;

Their lips locked. Rebecca never bothered opening her eyes, and when 
Jill didn&#39;t push her away, she raised a hand to her partner&#146;s face. No 
rejection yet, and her tongue was inserted. Still nothing. Could Jill 
feel the same way? Her whole world seemed to brighten. She raised 
another hand to her face, and stood up, not breaking the kiss.

Jill seemed to melt to the younger girls touch, though she felt bad 
about instigating anything. Rebecca was confused and might not be 
doing the right thing, but Jill wasn&#39;t about to stop her. Rebecca 
eventually broke it off, questioning Jill&#39;s lack of advancement with 
her gaze.

&quot;Don&#39;t you want the coffee?&quot; Jill asked shyly, worrying she had ended 
the whole thing.

Rebecca gave an innocent smile, and Jill stood up as well, re 
connecting their lips. She threw her arms around the girl, before 
pushing her away lightly. Rebecca stammered protest, but it was 
answered by some tugging on her robe. She helped undo the tightly 
wound garment, and it fell to the floor. 

Jill looked her body up and down, and licked her lips. Her underwear 
fit Rebecca a bit loosely, but she looked delicious none the less. 
Jill struggled with her own robe, her hands shaking. Rebecca moved her 
hands to help, but she took her sweet time slowly sliding them down 
Jill&#39;s luscious breasts.

By the time her hands had reached Jill&#39;s waist, the robe was long 
since gone. She lightly stroked her fingertips across the older 
woman&#39;s mid drift, and moved behind her. She made light circles on her 
stomach with her fingers, and with her free hand she teased her 
breasts through the fabric of her bra. 

Jill cringed as Rebecca&#39;s inexperienced yet instinct full touches 
continued. Jill wondered how someone who had apparently never done 
anything like this before was so good at it. She was melting under the 
girl&#39;s fingers, every stroke causing her body to cringe with pleasure.

Two of her fingers where slipped under the waistband of Jill&#39;s 
panties, lightly caressing the more sensitive skin. Slowly going lower 
each circle her hands made. She also slipped a finger under the fabric 
of her bra. Jill started finding it hard to stand, so she just fell 
back on her lover.

Though Jill was damn near collapsed in her arms, she wasn&#39;t done 
teasing her yet. She continued circling her hand lower and lower, 
until she found her shaven woman hood. She lightly stroked the skin 
above it, forcing a moan out of her partner. The finger in her bra had 
also found her nipple, and began lightly rubbing on it. She slowly 
began sliding the hand out of her panties, and slipped her fingers up 
the other side of her bra. 

She took her fingers out of the other side, and began purposely 
fumbling with the clasp and making it take as long as possible. Jill 
would have helped her along had her arms did what she told them too. 
She found it hard to think about anything other than Rebecca&#39;s soft 
skin, her small yet incredibly sexy frame, and her mind numbing touch. 
She was completely captivated by the woman behind her.

Finally the bra slid off. Jill had managed to stand up somewhat on her 
own, but the devilish teasing continued. A hand on each breast, very 
lightly caressing the skin around the edges. They creeped almost 
painfully slowly to the center of each, making Jill almost cry out in 
frustration. She was being completely dominated by the younger girl 
with just a touch. 

Finally the fingers prize was found. A light tweak was given to each 
nipple, and then the hands retreated. Rebecca turned her head and gave 
Jill a deep kiss as she fumbled with her own bra. It was soon gone, 
and she pressed her breasts against the older girl&#146;s back and embraced 
her tightly. She stopped kissing her and resumed her teasing nature, 
kissing and sucking on her neck all the way down to her shoulders. 

She nuzzled her face between the older girl&#39;s own and her breast, 
flicking out her tongue to touch the skin for just an instant. Her 
decent continued, as well as the light flicking of her tongue. Jill 
thought she might just go crazy before she had her release. A hand 
returned to her stomach, as did one to her other breast. They began 
the soft circles once more in unison as her lips and vicious tongue 
neared its destination.

Both lip and finger made contact with their prize, and another finger 
or two where slipped under the waistband of her panties. She began to 
suck lightly on one, and viously probe the other. The contrast of the 
soft and subtle licks on one side and the violent prods and tweaks on 
the other made Jill quiver. The other hand continued to lower its self 
closer and closer to Jill&#39;s womanhood. Lightly stroking the skin all 
around it, she eventually ran a finger over the lips. She did it 
again, and continued lightly stroking her. 

Jill moaned. She quickened the pace of her stroking in time with her 
sucking motions on a breast, and also slowed down her attack on the 
other all in time. Her tongue began to prod and lick more viciously, 
her fingers slowing down the assault to a very gentle circle, and then 
a finger was slipped inside Jill.

Rebecca stepped out in front of Jill, her fingers and mouth still in 
place. She raised her head from the girl&#146;s bosom and looked at her, 
the fiery desire to please clearly in her eyes. She motioned for the 
bedroom, and Jill quickly obliged. Woefully, her finger left Jill. She 
placed it in her mouth and sucked it clean. She licked her lips and 
smirked, making Jill follow her more quickly.

Rebecca stood beside the bed, patting it invitingly. Jill walked 
forward, and Rebecca immediately lunged at her in a kiss. Jill stood 
in the heat of the passion for a mere moment, before being pushed onto 
the bed. Rebecca mounted her waist, and had at some time before 
managed to get her panties off. She lightly moved her hips back and 
forth over Jill&#39;s hips, before slowly falling forward and taking a 
nipple into her mouth.

A hand also returned to her other breast, as did the magic finger to 
her woman hood. It was quietly and slowly inserted again, moving in 
and out slowly. Jill laid back and savored the moment. 

&quot;Oh...God...&quot; She moaned as the finger began to quicken it&#39;s pace. She 
raised her head and moved up slightly to kiss her lover, catching 
another moan. Their tongues swirled around each other for a moment, 
before she moved back down and began her work on the other breast. Her 
fingers slowed down, almost stopping. Another was inserted.

Slowly, more and more of her fingers slid into her. The pace also 
steadily began to quicken again, in time with how violently her tongue 
was pleasing Jill&#39;s breasts. Jill moaned again, raising her hips and 
Rebecca along with her. She thrusted herself outward, craving more. 
Rebecca raised up from the breast and moved back. She removed the 
finger from her partner and brought it to her lips. Jill hungrily 
licked her juices off of the finger.

The hands fell to her breasts, kneading them slowly. Another kiss, 
before Rebecca&#39;s head disappeared from view. Jill soon felt something 
warm teasing her from below her field of vision, licking the skin 
around the entrance to her flower. A hand strayed from teasing the 
breast to lightly caress Jill&#39;s smooth stomach. Rebecca continued her 
soft licks around Jill&#39;s petals, before delving into her. Her tongue 
licking the sensitive parts right near her entrance.

Jill moaned again. She obviously could not last another minuet of 
Rebecca&#39;s sweet torture. Her hips buckled and she started whimpering 
as Rebecca&#39;s tongue began to explore her womanhood. Every time it 
moved it sent jolts of pleasure through Jill&#39;s entire body. A hand 
floated back up to her breasts, trying to heighten the impending 
orgasm.

Rebecca&#39;s tongue continued licking around until she found what she was 
looking for. Her clitoris. A mere flick of the tongue was all Jill 
needed to explode with pleasure. Her hips raised off the bed, 
Rebecca&#39;s light licks keeping up with her. Jill&#39;s vision faded as the 
pleasure didn&#39;t stop. Rebecca continued to lap hungrily and extend the 
orgasm.

Jill her lover&#146;s name, as her vision completely faded and she lost 
consciousness. She was awoken in a moment, however, by her lover&#146;s 
lips. 

&quot;That was amazing,&quot; Jill said, still high off he pleasure. She slipped 
a hand down to Rebecca&#39;s stomach and began caressing, but she was 
stopped.

&quot;No, you don&#39;t have too. That&#39;s all I needed...&quot; She responded, 
pushing the hand away and kissing her new lover. &quot;Just sleep.&quot;

And they did. Waking up to the Alarm clock an hour before they where 
due out. Rebecca got up first, hitting the clock until it stopped its 
infernal noise. &quot;Jill...Wake up...&quot; She said groggily, shaking her 
partner by the shoulder.

&quot;What...? Oh...we gotta leave...&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

As Jill got up to get some clothes, she asked the question that had 
been burned into her mind since the first kiss. &quot;How did you know how 
to do that? It was amazing. I didn&#39;t know you knew...&quot;

&quot;I was in high school. She lived next door to me. There was a barn out 
in the woods behind the house, and she told me to meet her there 
one-day. She told me she thought I was cute. She was older than I by a 
couple years was and I thought it was cool that an older girl liked 
me, so I let her have her way.&quot;

Jill nodded as Rebecca continued the story. &quot;By the time she was 
finished, my Mom was out looking for me. I never did get to repay the 
favor...I&#39;ve kind of been planning that for a while.&quot;

She gave a light smile and kissed her friend. &quot;Anyway, I gotta get 
back to my place and get dressed,&quot; She started, looking down at her 
nakedness. &quot;Can I have a robe or something?&quot;
