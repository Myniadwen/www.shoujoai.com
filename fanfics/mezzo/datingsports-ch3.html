<h1>Dating and Other Dangerous Sports (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mezzo/index.html">Mezzo</a>

<a href="../mezzo/datingsports-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>All around them the club pulsed with noise and light,
the place crowded with beautiful women of all shapes
and types. Still, at the table there was a almost
eerie aura of stillness as Mitsuki dropped her
bombshell on Mikura.

&quot;My sister?&quot; Mikura repeated questioningly, her body
tensing up a bit as she continued, &quot;I don&#39;t have a
sister.&quot;

Mitsuki raised her drink to her lips, taking a careful
sip as she kept an eye on Mikura. &quot;I think you do,&quot;
she answered calmly.

&quot;Was this whole bodyguard job a sham?&quot; Mikura asked
flatly, the pink haired girl giving the older woman a
suspicious look.

&quot;No, I needed a bodyguard,&quot; Mitsuki reassured her, the
redhead smiling wryly, &quot;but I did choose you for a
reason.&quot;

&quot;When you say sister,&quot; Mikura asked her flatly,
&quot;you&#39;re talking about that psycho Momomi Momoi,
right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Momomi,&quot; Mitsuki agreed. She gave Mikura a
thoughtful glance, &quot;You didn&#39;t know she was your
sister?&quot;

&quot;No for sure,&quot; Mikura admitted. She paused a moment
then asked, &quot;You know that lesbian friend I
mentioned?&quot;

&quot;The one who tried to kill you?&quot; Mitsuki asked.

&quot;She claimed she was Momomi&#39;s lover.&quot; Mikura said
grimly, &quot;and that Momomi was my half sister.&quot;

&quot;Ring ring darling,&quot; as breezy voice interrupted them.

Mikura looked up, blinking as she nearly collided with
a impressive set of breats. The blonde had a
surprisingly exagerated body, round breasts and curvy
hips reminding one of some primative earth goddess
figure.

&quot;Hello Olive,&quot; Mitsuki looked faintly amused.

&quot;You really need to mix, love,&quot; Olive chided as she
leaned against the back of Mikura&#39;s chair, &quot;the stars
can&#39;t do it all, you know.&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes I know,&quot; Mitsuki sighed. She smiled at
Mikura, &quot;This is Olive, she&#39;s our public relations
expert and a former actress.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Mikura nodded respectfully.

&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Olive reached out to run a finger along
Mikura&#39;s cheek, &quot;aren&#39;t you the cute one!&quot; She looked
up at Mitsuki, &quot;Darling, she&#39;s adorable.&quot;

&quot;Also jail bait,&quot; Mitsuki noted.

&quot;I really like people talking about me like I&#39;m not
here,&quot; Mikura noted dryly.

&quot;Sorry, my sweet,&quot; Olive purred at Mikura.

Mikura rolled her eyes, &quot;And I&#39;m not your sweet.&quot;

&quot;She does that to everyone,&quot; Mitsuki smiled wryly.
Looking back at Olive she said, &quot;All right, I&#39;ll
mingle. But just for a little while.&quot;

&quot;And keep this fierce one with you too,&quot; Olivia said
as she turned and walked away, &quot;I&#39;m sure someone will
try to snatch her up if you don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s kidding, right?&quot; Mikura asked.

&quot;About my mingling or you being snatched up?&quot; Mitsuki
asked as she got up. &quot;No to both, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;

&quot;Marvelous,&quot; Mikura grumbled as she closely followed
Mitsuki.

The next hour was a blur of faces, scents and wild
clothes as they moved from table to table and group to
group, talking and chatting. The beautiful women were
elegant, sexy and as dangerous as a unsheathed blade,
in many ways. Mikura also found herself the victim of
their unwanted gazes, only stopping when they met her
deadly eyes.

&quot;You&#39;re doing wonders for my reputation, you know,&quot;
Mitsuki murmured as they left yet another group
behind.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Mikura asked, warily scanning the crowd.

Mitsuki looked amused, &quot;I heard a few of them
commenting they wee impressed I tamed a wildcat like
you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t tame,&quot; Mikura answered dryly.

Mitsuki studied her a moment, &quot;Maybe not, but I
suspect I&#39;d love to try.&quot;

Mikura gave her a wary look, &quot;No thank you.&quot; Softening
her glance a little she added, &quot;Not until we talk
about why you REALLY hired me, anyway.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll look forward to that,&quot; Mitsuki grinned.

&quot;Miss Aya,&quot; a tall, black haired woman in punk
leathers elbowed her way through the crush of people
in the busy club, &quot;I&#39;ve been looking for you all
night.&quot;

&quot;Rei,&quot; Mitsuki nodded, clearly annoyed at her
conversation with Mikura being interrupted yet again,
&quot;good to see you.&quot;

&quot;Friend of yours?&quot; Mikura asked under her breath.

&quot;Actress,&quot; Mitsuki answered, &quot;not quite a friend.&quot;

&quot;Have you made a decision on the part?&quot; Rei asked
eagerly, the slightly older woman fixing Mitsuki with
a intense look.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Mitsuki didn&#39;t conceal her irritation,
&quot;but we&#39;re still discussing casting. Once we&#39;ve made
up our minds, we&#39;ll let you know.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re casting a younger woman,&quot; Rei stiffened, &quot;like
this girl aren&#39;t you?!&quot;

&#145;Uh oh,&#39; Mikura thought as she moved forward as she
saw Rei covertly reaching into her leather jacket&#39;s
pocket.

&quot;Bitch,&quot; Rei drew a switchblade, the knife popping out
with a snap as she moved, &quot;pass me over will you?!&quot;

Whack!

Gracefully Mikura chopped the side of her hand on
Rei&#39;s arm, sending the blade clattering away into the
darkness. Before the woman could recover she punched
out fast, sending the woman reeling, blood running
down from her nose. Finally Mikura bounced up, almost
hanging in mid-air as she kicked out viscously,
sending Rei crashing to the ground out cold.

&quot;My god,&quot; Mitsuki breathed out.

&quot;She telegraphed her move,&quot; Mikura shrugged casually.
She looked up at Mitsuki, &quot;How long has she been
looking for this part, and how long have you been
getting threats?&quot;

&quot;About the same,&quot; Mitsuki conceded.

&quot;All right, the buff doorman forced his way through
the crowd of watchers, &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot; His tone
instantly changed from rough to pleasant when he saw
Mikura, &quot;I mean, how can I help you ma&#39;am?&quot;

Mikura smiled wryly, &quot;Attempted assault by the out
cold lady there on my partner.&quot; She looked at Mitsuki,
&quot;You want the cops brought in?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Mitsuki sighed.

&quot;I&#39;ll call,&quot; the bouncer nodded.

After a long meeting with the cops, several witness
statements and such the party lurched to a stop, the
young ladies scattering to the four winds. Escorting
Mitsuki out to her car Mikura said, &quot;I think my job is
done, here. You want to send payment to the DSA or pay
me here?&quot;

Mitsuki leaned against her sports car, &quot;We never did
have that talk.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I trust you to give me a straight
answer,&quot; Mikura admitted after a moment.

Mitsuki used the remote on her key&#39;s to pop the doors,
&quot;Come home with me, I&#39;ll feed you and explain why I
hired you.&quot;

Mikura&#39;s stomach grumbled, reminding them both that
they hadn&#39;t had a chance to eat anything much at the
party.

&quot;Well?&quot; Mitsuki smiled teasingly.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Mikura agreed, climbing into the car.
