<h1>Dating and Other Dangerous Sports (part 1 of 4)</h1>

<pre>&quot;All right,&quot; Kurokawa said as the balding man stirred the plate of 
noodles he was frying, &quot;you want us to do what for you, young lady?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Harada said as the blond sat nearby, his hair done up in it&#39;s 
usual odd spikes, &quot;this doesn&#39;t sound like our normal jobs.&quot;

&quot;My name is Mitsuki Aya,&quot; the redheaded woman smiled slightly, &quot;and I 
need a bodyguard.&quot; She sat back comfortably on the couch, her blue dress 
clinging to every one of her generous curves.

Both Harada and Kurokawa exchanged a look and chorused, &quot;We&#39;ll do it!&quot;

&quot;Oh, no, you won&#39;t do at all,&quot; Mitsuki waved a hand casually as she 
said, &quot;I had your other associate in mind.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Mikura Syzuki blinked at them in surprise as the pink haired 
younger woman entered their new headquarters, a building not far from 
the old barbershop they had been based above for so long. &quot;Who&#39;s the old 
lady?&quot; she asked casually.

&quot;Mikura,&quot; Harada clapped a hand over her mouth, &quot;that was rude!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s our new client,&quot; Kurokawa noted with amusement as he stirred 
their lunch.

&quot;Really,&quot; Mikura said after she shrugged off his grip, looking at the 
stranger skeptically, her blue eyes narrowed. Then suddenly she 
stiffened, her eyes widening uncontrollably.

&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Kurokawa and Harada said almost as one.

&quot;Is she all right?&quot; Mitsuki asked, half out of her comfortable chair and 
ready to hurry to the younger woman&#39;s side.

&quot;She&#39;ll be fine in a moment,&quot; Kurokawa explained as Mikura suddenly 
relaxed.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Mikura muttered as she sat in the only available place, nearby 
Mitsuki. The visions of the future were a random gift, she didn&#39;t know 
where they came from or why she had them. And in a time like this, they 
could be very inconvenient.

&quot;You all right?&quot; Harada asked. In fact what the tech wizard really 
wanted to ask was what she had seen, but it didn&#39;t seem appropriate to 
do so in front of a customer.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Mikura answered as she sat. She looked over at Mitsuki, &quot;So 
what do you want to hire us for?&quot;

&quot;As I explained to your associates,&quot; Mitsuki smiled at her, &quot;I want to 
retain the services of the Danger Service Agency as my bodyguards.&quot;

Mikura had lived on the streets before Kurokawa had met her, and over 
the years had learned to read people pretty well. &quot;So why does someone 
like you need a bodyguard?&quot; she asked her warily.

Both Kurokawa and Harada exchanged very guilty looks, not having thought 
of asking that question. Or if they were honest, they had been too 
distracted by their clients looks to ask those kind of questions.

Mitsuki nodded comfortably, as if she expected the lady of the 
organization to be the one who took care of business. &quot;I work in the 
entertainment business,&quot; Mitsuki said casually, &quot;a fierce rival of mine 
wants me eliminated.&quot;

&quot;Fierce indeed,&quot; Kurokawa nodded sagely.

&quot;What kind of entertainment?&quot; Mikura asked suspiciously.

&quot;I&#39;m a director and star of pornographic films,&quot; Mitsuki explained 
cheerfully.

You could have heard a pin drop as Harada nearly choked on his drink and 
Kurokawa froze stirring lunch. &quot;I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t recognize you 
before,&quot; Kurokawa blurted before he could think about it.

&quot;Perverted old man,&quot; Mikura muttered.

&quot;I doubt most people watching such films are studying my face,&quot; Mitsuki 
chuckled, her laughter making her full breasts jiggle a bit. She leaned 
forward, eyes moving across the three of them, &quot;So, will you take the 
job?&quot;

&quot;Excuse us a moment while we confer,&quot; Kurokawa said as he switched the 
stove off and led his two associates to the other side of their new 
living room. &quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;She hasn&#39;t told us everything,&quot; Mikura frowned.

&quot;Most people in this position don&#39;t,&quot; Kurokawa noted. He gave Mikura a 
begging look, &quot;Mikura, she&#39;s a porn star! Think of the possibilities!&quot;

&quot;She could call up a couple of her friends and...&quot; Harada trailed off, a 
bright blush coloring his cheeks.

&quot;For all you know she&#39;s the whips and chains style of porn star,&quot; Mikura 
frowned at them. &quot;Besides, why does she just want me? Something smells,&quot; 
she finished.

&quot;I think that&#39;s Harada,&quot; Kurokawa noted.

&quot;Hey, I bathe!&quot; Harada protested, &quot;Usually.&quot;

&quot;Ewww!&quot; Mikura made a face.

Softly Kurokawa asked, &quot;Was the vision you had about her? Is she in 
danger?&quot;

&quot;No, or not in the way you think,&quot; Mikura said, trying not to let the 
fleeting images of her vision trouble her too much. She shook her head 
before adding, &quot;I&#39;m not in danger, or at least not the way you think.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Kurokawa blinked.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s up to you,&quot; Harada finally said, &quot;you&#39;re going to be the one 
working with her the most, you decide.&quot;

Mikura had to fight back a very uncharacteristic giggle as both fully 
grown men gave her their very best version of puppy-dog eyes. Fighting 
back a sigh of resignation she finally conceded, &quot;All right, I&#39;ll do 
it.&quot;

Mitsuki looked up curiously from where she sat on the couch, her green 
eyes clearly touched by amusement. &quot;Have you made up your minds?&quot; she 
asked, one leg crossed over the other in a vampish pose.

&quot;The DSA will be taking on your case,&quot; Kurokawa nodded to her seriously, 
his grave expression as respectful as any usual businessman. Sadly the 
drool at the corner of his mouth rather spoiled the whole effect.

&quot;Pervert,&quot; Mikura muttered as she followed Harada back to his new 
workroom.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mitsuki&#39;s eyes followed Mikura as she left then she sat 
back with a sigh. &quot;When can you start?&quot;

&quot;When would you prefer?&quot; Kurokawa asked as he refilled her glass.

&quot;As soon as possible,&quot; Mitsuki said, &quot;ideally I&#39;d like to leave here 
with her...&quot;

Mitsuki&#39;s voice faded as Harada closed the door to the workroom behind 
them. &quot;I&#39;ll want a two way radio,&quot; Mikura said to him bluntly, &quot;and I&#39;ll 
need my pistols, too.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Harada agreed as he hauled the pistols out for her.

&quot;And that new armor cloth outfit you had made for me, too,&quot; Mikura said 
as she smoothly went over her two semi-automatic pistols.

That made Harada stop a moment and looked at her in surprise. &quot;Do you 
really think things could be that bad?&quot; he asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Mikura shrugged as she slid the guns into their 
holsters, &quot;but I&#39;d rather be prepared.&quot;</pre>
