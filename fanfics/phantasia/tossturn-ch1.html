<pre>	&#147;Can&#146;t sleep&#133;&#148; Arche whined. The pink haired witch tossed and 
turned in the &#145;peasant-sized&#146; bed as she liked to call it. She finally 
surrendered to the insomnia and got out of bed. The young half-elf lit 
a candle on the dresser and stared at herself in the mirror from head 
to toe. Her pink her reached down past her shoulders, when it wasn&#146;t 
tied into a ponytail. In only her red night robe, she could tell that 
she was beautiful with no doubt in her mind. Her breasts were nice and 
round; the exact size she wanted them. She looked down to her hips, so 
lovely and attractive. She was certain that almost anybody would at 
least have their attention changed to Arche for a moment if she walked 
by. She sighed, held her arms and giggled slightly at the thought of 
being trailed by lustful men and women alike.

	Speaking of which reminded the beautiful half elf of the three 
people she traveled with. Cless, their fearless leader and super melee 
man, came to her mind first. Sure, she had dreamt fantasies about him 
in the past, but that was just a way to pleasure herself; it wasn&#146;t 
love. Klarth, the selfish, arrogant, yet mysteriously handsome 
summoner of the group was next in line to come to thought. The 
summoner did treat Arche with respect and the witch might&#146;ve been 
happy to give Klarth her love. But Klarth only respected her only 
because she had good magic power for her age. Other than that, Klarth 
was just another friend who wasn&#146;t in love with Arche. Then, came 
Mint; sweet, lovely Mint. Arche remembered the first she laid eyes on 
that incredible maiden. Emerald eyes as beautiful as emerald jewels 
themselves, long blond hair that shined like the spring sun and 
smooth, soft skin that encouraged anyone to cuddle against and gently 
kiss it. Just thinking about Mint caused a small wetness between 
Arche&#146;s legs. Her hands crept up her arms and nudged off the straps to 
the night robe, letting it fall to her feet. Arche&#146;s hands moved from 
her shoulders down to her lovely breasts and gently caressed them. The 
half-elf let out a soft moan of pleasure, thinking more deeply about 
her beloved Mint. She then began to fantasize about her.

	She fantasized that as she stood there, Mint would come up 
behind her and assist her in her caress, while pressing her own 
wonderful breasts against the witch&#146;s back. Arche turned her head and 
imagined Mint&#146;s irresistible face right there kissing her 
passionately. Arche made a crack in her lips, pretending that her 
fantasy was slipping her tongue into the witch&#146;s mouth and navigate 
the deep reaches of it. Then, Mint would guide one of Arche&#146;s hands 
down to her wet sex. Upon reaching her shaved opening, Arche went in 
and pleasured herself as Mint would come in with her. She started 
slowly and even then, she moaned loudly. Then she imagined her fantasy 
going in deeper and harder and Arche followed, wanting to keep up with 
the maiden.

------------------------------------------------------------

	In one room over, Cless and Klarth lifted their heads from their 
card hands, hearing a loud moaning sound. &#147;Was that Arche?&#148; Cless 
pondered.

	&#147;What are you talking about, Cless? I heard nothing.&#148; Klarth 
lied. Even though the summoner could be the biggest pain in the ass 
sometimes, he was not the kind to intrude on someone&#146;s happiness. 
&#147;Now, are you hit or stay?&#148;

	Cless looked back at his hand &#147;Uh, hit.&#148; Klarth moved his left 
hand over the deck and with the swift movement of his hand, he took a 
card out of his sleeve, looking as though he took it from the deck, 
and tossed it to Cless. The leader groaned when he added up the total. 
&#147;Damn! I bust.&#148; Klarth only chuckled.

------------------------------------------------------------

	Arche&#146;s legs had weakened from the extensive pleasure and she 
laid herself onto the bed, still fingering herself. At this point, 
Mint would climb on top of Arche and continued to grope and finger 
her. She would stop kissing Arche, only to lower her lips down to her 
pink nipple and start to kiss and suckle it gently. Then she would 
move her hand from Arche&#146;s breast and suckle that one.

	Arche arched her back in happiness, as Mint would take out her 
finger as well as the witch&#146;s and begin licking between her boobs, 
then lower to her bellybutton, where she kissed for a moment before 
continuing. She would stop above Arche&#146;s special spot and marvel in 
its beauty before diving in and lapping at it. The mere thought of 
this gave the half-elf an intense feeling as pleasure. Arche moaned 
out Mint&#146;s name several times before having her orgasm, staining the 
bed sheets. The half-elf breathed heavily, covered in sweat. She then 
imagined Mint holding her close as a mother would hold her child.

	&#147;Oh, Mint&#133;&#148; Arche whispered, trying to hold her fantasy, &#147;I love 
you so much.&#148; Then, being exhausted, the witch took the covers, 
wrapped herself in it, rolled into a ball, and fell into a peaceful 
slumber. If Cless, or Mint asked anything about what happened, Arche 
would just simply lie. But she knew would have to confess her feelings 
sometime soon. But let&#146;s not worry now, she thought; we&#146;ll just wait 
and see who else joins our little party.
