Foreword

Well, she (*points at muse*) wasn&#39;t going to leave me alone unless I 
did this, so here you are.
This one is going to be strictly Arche&#39;s point of view. I&#39;ll be 
jumping around a lot and won&#39;t actually stay with one scene too long 
since I really don&#39;t want to make this longer than I have to.
For all who are wondering, this is based on the original SNES version 
and the DeJap translation patch.
Now, on with the show. I hope you like.

******************************

Time can do funny things to you, I tell you that. Time will make us 
grow up, make us more mature and such things, they also say time can 
mend all wounds... well, at least to a degree. Time affects a great 
number of things. In fact, without time I doubt there would even be 
life. Why? Simple enough. Without the passage of time would we even be 
aware of ourselves, would we even be aware that we are alive. How 
could we live without ever dying. Those two things rely on each other. 
Like there is no light without shadow and vice versa.
	Time also affects love... or at least they say that. Although... 
theories and opinions are differing. For some time cannot touch true 
love, for others time can change your feelings as it passes. Then 
there is that saying that time does not matter to the heart. What I 
think about that? Well, in my case, it probably is all of the above 
combined.
	I sighed heavily, annoyed at my wandering thoughts. I sounded 
like a philosopher or something. Right. Could you imagine me spitting 
out such nonsense in a permanent fashion? Thankfully those thoughts 
were just a product out of boredom and well, personal interest. I had 
studied the damn topic for almost the last hundred years. What do you 
expect? And right now, I had nothing better to do when to sit around 
here in the branches of the ancient tree and watching the young woman 
at its base tending to it with loving attention. Well, fine. I had 
better things to do actually when just watch but I guess I was just 
too much of a coward to act.
	Right Arche Klaine, the coward, who would have thought.
	My lips formed another soundless sigh, my mind once again 
beginning to wander...

******************************

&lt;4253&gt;
It&#39;s been twenty years now since Klarth had died. Didn&#39;t even make it 
past sixty the fool. I didn&#39;t have any idea why that was, only a 
lurking suspicion. I was pretty sure it had something to do with a 
case of overwork. He had been working on something important - at 
least to him - in his last years and seemed pretty determined to 
finish it fast. What? I&#39;ve got no idea. Other than the occasional 
assistance in some minor quest for magical knowledge I wasn&#39;t that 
much around.
	Not that I detested his company all of a sudden. No, certainly 
not. He and Miranda were always very nice and hospitable. It was nice 
to spend some time with them but too much only reminded me of the rest 
of our group we had left behind in the future. And I wasn&#39;t so good in 
hiding the sadness that invoked as the old leech obviously could. Not 
that he could fool me a second with his &#39;brave&#39; attitude. He had been 
missing Cless, Mint and Chester just as much as I did.
	Most of the time after our return to this age I was spending 
time my parents. While they were still not allowing half-elves into 
the village, there were other ways of meeting with my mother, 
especially thanks to the power-up Volt had given my broom. It was 
still working, amazingly enough. That made traveling a whole lot 
easier. It barely took me a day&#39;s trip to get from the Sylph&#39;s valley 
to Ymir and back. Seeing mother again after so long, with just the 
hazy memories of a child to begin with, had been a wonderful 
experience. She was a really kind person.
	A few years ago father died as well. It was such a sad thing. 
Mother had even said that she might be able to get out of the village 
to visit. While she had been aware of father&#39;s growing age, she said 
it did not matter to her. She had known from the start that she would 
outlive him. I really wanted to curse the elves for being so 
narrow-minded. They took away the only few years those two could have 
spent together. And for what? Because they were too stuck up to 
explain to mankind the consequences of abusing magic.
	Right now I was sitting in the small study of my house. I had 
given up the cottage father and I shared at the valley and sold it to 
someone from Euclid. Too many memories. With the money I had bought 
myself a small house near Alvanista but most of my time was spent in 
either the castle - I had become pretty good friends with Runeglom - 
Thor or in Edward&#39;s old place. I knew they were going to make it into 
a school soon and I was busy moving all the important, secret books 
and notes over to my place.
	Why I was doing that? Edward had left some notes of his theories 
on time travel, both Klarth and I had worked on them for years. At 
first it had been a welcome diversion from the mundane life, something 
to occupy my mind other than my parents while I waited a century to 
meet my friends again. To meet Chester again... Over time though, the 
entire field had become rather intriguing and I had found some answers 
to questions that had had been left unanswered for a long time.
	I had reached a point now where I could hardly advance much 
further and if, it was done in a much slower pace quickly inspiring 
boredom. I had never been a very patient student, never imagined I 
would do something remotely scholastic. Not that I viewed myself as a 
scholar. I was still a practicing mage, and a damn good one I dared to 
say without shame. However, I knew just as well as Klarth did that 
time magic was a dangerous field and someone had to know about it to 
meet the possibility of abuse. I wasn&#39;t going to teach that to anyone 
or only to someone I trusted, yet as tightly involved in the change of 
history as we had been I saw it as my responsibility to ensure that 
the timeline would now continue smoothly.
	I put the book I was currently reading aside, not able to 
concentrate any further today. Especially on passages I had read over 
a dozen times without coming any closer to a solution. Rubbing my eyes 
from the strain of working for hours I stretched my tired limbs but 
made no move to get out of the comfortable chair. This was getting 
less and less satisfying and fulfilling. And it was still a good 
thirty years before Cless and the rest were going to be born if I 
calculated everything just right... which I was pretty sure I did or 
my efforts would have been a total failure.
	&#39;Great, Arche. You are probably the biggest expert on the 
element of time and you don&#39;t even know what to do with your own.&#39; It 
was getting really boring... and lonely. As a half breed friends - 
real friends I mean - were a rare thing. I wasn&#39;t the only one with 
that problem. Outside from others of my kin it was hard to find anyone 
truly accepting you for what you were. Often you were met with either 
distaste or fear on the one and overwhelming awe on the other. To find 
someone honest who just wanted to be your friend for the person you 
are inside... I was really missing Lia. If she hadn&#39;t been killed by 
Demitel...
	There was no use in worrying about such things. I had to find 
something to occupy my time with and fast. Excessive boredom only led 
to wandering, nostalgic thoughts and that was the last thing I wanted 
right now.

******************************

&lt;Present Time&gt;
Time was really a hard concept to understand, to fully comprehend. I 
doubt that it was even possible. Even I who had studied so much about 
its lore, was not quite sure how it really worked. Our battle with 
Dhaos had created so many disturbances, so many irregularities on the 
timeline, one should think its effect much more far reaching. Not so 
much for me or Klarth, for us the events about a century ago were the 
present. There never had been another. But for the other three, for 
Cless and Mint, their present should have been greatly altered. And 
yet all that seemed changed - judged by the little I could tell only 
having a small amount of information about their lives before 
traveling back to our time - was the healthiness of the tree in 
which&#39;s branches I was sitting right now. The bright flourish of Mana 
was tangible to my senses, pure and strong. It was as if it had never 
been weakened in the first place.
	As for the lives of my friends though. The best explanation I 
had been able to come up with all my time studying was that time had a 
way of protecting itself from a devastating paradox that could have 
ripped apart its very fabric. I never quite realized just what kind of 
effect we had had on history, what could have happened if somehow 
things hadn&#39;t been brought back to their proper path. In fact all that 
really remained from the disturbance now was the eradication of Dhaos 
from the timeline as well as the continuous existence of magic.
	What I had seen unfolding before my eyes these last years had 
been straining my resolve to not intervene. I cursed my innate 
understanding of why things had to happen as they happened. Had I not 
known, I would have had at least an excuse for intervening, for making 
things better for Cless, Chester and Mint, to prevent all this 
unnecessary bloodshed. Yet, I knew. I knew that doing so had the very 
likely possibility of in the best case distorting the entire timeline 
and in the worst ending reality as we knew it. Time was something not 
to be tempered with. Not even for good reasons.
	And so I stood by helplessly as Time sought to protect itself by 
claiming the lives that needed to be claimed in order to justify my 
friend&#39;s existence and involvement in its earlier alteration.
	&quot;So, it was you after all.&quot;
	I almost fell down from my sitting place as the soft voice 
reached me through the vast foliage of Martel. I had been so lost in 
my thoughts I hadn&#39;t really paid attention to the girl underneath who 
had by now finished with her tasks. She still stood in the shadow of 
the tree&#39;s canopy and didn&#39;t exactly look up into my direction and yet 
it was rather clear that I was discovered.
	Well, I had planned on confronting her today anyway, had I not? 
The separation had become unbearable as had keeping in that which had 
grown in my heart throughout the last years. As much as it scared me, 
I needed to get this off my chest, if only to lighten the weight for 
myself. I wasn&#39;t sure what I expected really. From her, from me. And 
that scared me even more... I couldn&#39;t turn back now though. I doubted 
my conscience would agree with it.
	Hopping on my broom I descended the few feet downwards to ground 
level. As I finally stood in the low grass of the clearing surrounding 
the Yggdrasil, I glanced shyly at the other girl... woman. There was 
nothing girlish about her except maybe that certain spark of 
innocence, of purity that she had maintained despite recent events. I 
had been dreading and looking forward to this. And consequently, I 
felt rather awkward standing there, having been caught before I was 
really ready. Then again, if she hadn&#39;t caught me, I probably would 
have sat there all day without moving.
	&quot;Uh... Hi, Mint!&quot; I greeted in an attempt of my normal 
cheerfulness. &quot;How long did you know I was here?&quot;
	Mint Adnade smiled serenely but I could see a little sparkle in 
her eyes. &quot;Oh, not too long.&quot;
	Yeah, right. I should have known better than to use Martel as an 
observation place. The young cleric and the Life Tree were already 
connected on so many levels, sensing me up there shouldn&#39;t have been 
much of a problem. &quot;Yes, well,&quot; I fumbled for words, cursing my sudden 
bout of shyness. &#39;Get a grip, girl. You are not usually this 
closemouthed. Talk!&#39;
	&quot;It&#39;s nice to see you again,&quot; Mint cut into my mental tirade and 
rewarded me with a pleased smile that made me wobbly. &#39;Stupid 
hormones.&#39; Blue eyes turned confused though as the other girl 
obviously realized something. &quot;Um, why are you here? I mean, not that 
I&#39;m not happy to see you but... I thought you&#39;d first want to go and 
visit Chester.&quot;
	Err, how to explain that one, how to explain... Oh sure, my 
intention was still the same but um, not so direct and... Gah! Over 
one hundred years in age difference and I couldn&#39;t get my mouth to 
work. Why did this have to happen anyway? It would have been so easy 
to do just what Mint had suggested. So easy... and dishonest. I 
couldn&#39;t deny anymore what had started to grow in my heart, what had 
started to change that I thought unchangeable. And now I was lost in 
the unexpected. Which was why I was here after all, right?

******************************

&lt;4299&gt;
I wasn&#39;t sure why I was here again. Not really anyway. I had started 
to visit my friends as they grew up as a way of passing the time. 
Besides I had been curious, what Cless and Chester had been like when 
they grew up. And in a way I was also driven by guilt. Yes, guilt. 
Regardless of what Klarth as well as Edward in his notes had 
explicitly warned me about, I felt guilty for standing by and just 
watching all this when it would be so easy to do something.
	I had been so startled that when I discovered the cause of why 
apparently nothing had changed by Dhaos&#39; removal from the timeline for 
Cless and the others. Mostly because the alien mage wasn&#39;t exactly, 
completely removed. He was still a part of history. Some things had 
started to fall into place when I figured out that Dhaos, after he had 
escaped from us in the past, had not fled to the distant future - as 
we had all thought - but actually to the time where according to the 
notes Cless and Mint had received their ancestors had sent him to the 
first time around. At which point he was imprisoned by their parents 
and Tornix D. Morrisson, just like he was supposed to.
	We had thought that we had actually defeated Dhaos back at the 
mausoleum but it seemed he had tricked us all and moved forward in 
time once more instead. So the Dhaos that we battled three times had 
to be one and the same... It made sense in a twisted way. Time was 
protecting itself. Dhaos had to be imprisoned, in order for him to be 
set free by events that eventually entangled Cless, Mint and Chester 
into the situation, leading the first two to end up in our time. If 
that didn&#39;t happen, they would have been to the past but at the same 
time wouldn&#39;t... Which made for a quite nasty paradox.
	I didn&#39;t claim to understand it all. But I knew logically that 
there wasn&#39;t anything I could do. With my honed skills, I was pretty 
sure I could have made sure that when Dhaos appeared in this time he 
was not just simply sealed but destroyed. But who would have made him 
flee forward in time then in the first place? No one. And so I stood 
by, knowing that by allowing all that to transpire that would preserve 
the timeline, I would condemn an entire village and countless other 
lives, including my friend&#39;s parents to death.
	Wouldn&#39;t you feel guilty?
	I watched from the shadows as Merril Adnade finished tugging in 
a peacefully sleeping, twelve year old Mint. For a time I just stood 
there in the darkness of the room, waiting until I was sure that 
neither mother or daughter were awake anymore. Then I carefully crept 
forward until I was at the young girl&#39;s bed side, gazing at the 
sleeping form of my soon-to-be friend. This ritual had started some 
years ago. I knew that soon I couldn&#39;t do this anymore. Mint&#39;s powers 
were growing and soon I wouldn&#39;t be able to conceal myself from her 
properly. And it wouldn&#39;t do good for her to see me before she was 
even supposed to be meeting me.
	I should be watching Chester or maybe Cless anyway, I should... 
But who was I kidding. I had spent more time watching Mint grow up 
than the other two. At first, yes, at first I had watched all three of 
them. Until I finally figured out that one little secret that changed 
so very much. Had I been younger, I probably would have only seen the 
advantage without the drawback, but age, maturity, didn&#39;t allow me 
that anymore. And I had felt sad for my friend. In all the years, I 
had never seen her complain about the lack of a father figure. She 
never even asked...
	Carefully, as not to disturb the sleeping blonde, I stroked over 
her forehead. &quot;Poor thing. You&#39;ll never know your real father.&quot; I had 
known what it was like to grow up just with one parent, being told the 
other was dead. That is why I had been so furious at first after 
finding out Dad had lied to me. But at least, now I had Mom back. I 
could at least claim to have known both of my parents. But fate would 
never allow Mint the same.
	I had been so shocked after I found out. I wasn&#39;t even sure he 
knew, suspected maybe but...
	After that discovery, I had been drawn back countless times 
here, times I should have spent watching my actual love interest 
Chester as I had planned too, and maybe sneak a peek or two at Cless 
who I still had some lingering feelings for. But somewhere in between 
now and then, things had changed. I had thought I would miss the idiot 
more when I returned to my own time. I had thought I would long for 
the day of our reunion the more time passed. Instead the feelings I 
had thought so strong in the final stages of our battle with Dhaos had 
diminished instead. And now... Yes, now...
	A tear slid down my cheek but I didn&#39;t even realize it as it ran 
down my cheek. How could that had happened? Had it been there all this 
time and I just realized it now or had these feelings blossomed with 
the decades spent alone? It wasn&#39;t just pity, or compassion. It was 
much, much more... and it scared me. I was falling in love with my 
best female friend without her actually knowing me yet. There was no 
denying it. And I had no idea what to do now. I had never before given 
the notion consideration before. However, hadn&#39;t that been because I 
already knew, deep in my mind back then that Cless and Mint were 
supposed to be together?
	That&#39;s what I had thought, that&#39;s what everyone had thought. But 
now, with the twisted, ironic truth that only I knew, things suddenly 
looked different. And I had myself let remember, all those small 
instance, the bonding that had instantly taken place between us even 
though we were so vastly different in character. Mint had become such 
a good friend and somehow, without me noticing, had wormed herself 
deeper into my heart when I had even realized. Until now.
	What should I do? I thought frantically, the realization 
suddenly crystal-clear in my mind and heart. Before I could really 
further think about it though, I noticed the younger version of the 
object of my current dilemma stir. Blurrily she began to open her 
eyes. Startled I made for a hasty retreat, hoping she hadn&#39;t seen me. 
Well, considering that time itself didn&#39;t collapse afterwards she 
obviously hadn&#39;t. Or if, it didn&#39;t have such a great effect as I had 
feared it would.
	I came back a couple of times though, much more wary now but 
unable to resist. My heart had set both feet firmly on that path now 
and as much as I tried, I couldn&#39;t turn back.

******************************

&lt;Present Time&gt;
Silence hang in the air once again. I shifted uncomfortably in a low 
breeze ruffling my clothes. I usually was much more chipper. Flirting 
never was a problem and still came to me like second nature even 
though I had felt less of a need in all that time after returning to 
my own time. It had felt not so right anymore now that I had 
technically a boyfriend waiting for me in the future... However, 
flirting and actually declaring someone your deepest feelings were two 
totally different things. And Mint was so... innocent, so 
pure-hearted, I wondered if she&#39;d even understand while I was 
stumbling over my words.
	&quot;Arche?&quot; Mint began tentatively, breaking the silence.
	I let impulses take charge. As I often did when I was 
embarrassed about something. When I had thought I had fallen in love 
with Chester I had been equally nervous and proceeded to cover that 
nervousness by taking action, the direct way instead of the slow path. 
I admit that for all my flirting and brash behavior in my youth, 
things like this had always made me nervous. Stronger connections, 
deeper feelings. I never quite knew how to deal with them and usually 
handled them after the fight of flight principle.
	Well, I chose to fight, seeing no possible escape. Mint was too 
surprised to react as first. I had stepped forward, crossing the 
distance between us and lifting her chin in one moment, completing the 
maneuver in a flawless execution of the eventual goal. When seconds 
had passed without any reaction at all from the thorough kiss, 
awareness of just what I had done prodded at the edges of my 
conscience and I knew that I had probably screwed this up royally.
	That was when I felt Mint kissing back. I was so startled I 
would have forgotten to breathe for a moment if that hadn&#39;t been such 
an unnecessary issue at the time. I had to steady myself with my hands 
on her hips from the sudden intensity as the other girl actually took 
the initiative, her tongue brushing against my lips... In response 
Mint&#39;s arms came up to wrap around my neck - I had gotten quite a bit 
taller after a century - and I yielded to her probing efforts.
	I had honestly not expected this. I had not thought the often so 
naive seeming girl capable of this kind of reaction. Frankly, I had 
been expecting all kinds of reaction, from rejection over disappoint 
to incomprehension. Mint had the kind of innocent and pure worldview 
that would make her often not understand bad things. Not that I 
thought love between two of the same gender was a bad thing. Not at 
all. In fact, elves were rather open-minded in that regard as I had 
learned. But humans, humans were another matter. They tended to go 
around, pointing fingers at what didn&#39;t fit into their view of things. 
Things like that, Mint usually didn&#39;t understand, which I actually 
envied her for. She looked at the world more from the eyes of a child 
that saw than that of an adult that had closed their eyes, exchanging 
simplicity for complexity which they tended to call maturity.
	I really didn&#39;t expect that reaction and for awhile roles had 
been reversed and I could only response, blissfully swept away in an 
unexpected tidal wave of emotions.
	We pulled apart gasping after a long time, at least it seemed 
like a long time. I had not even dared to hope this could happen. But 
it had and that left me staring at the beautiful face just inches away 
from mine.
	Mint wasn&#39;t all that innocent now, was she?
	&quot;My angel,&quot; the blonde cleric whispered, more to her self than 
to anyone in particular but since we were so close I picked it up.
	&quot;What?&quot; I asked confused. Still not quite comprehending what 
just transpired.
	Mint grinned softly. &quot;When I grew up, I used to dream of someone 
visiting me at night. A kind, protective spirit. Mother told me it had 
to be a guardian angel watching over me.&quot; I blushed, realizing that I 
had apparently not been all that secretive as I had hoped. &quot;That was 
you, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Mint asked.
	I saw no real need in denying it anymore. I was allowed to after 
all. From now on, the timeline would take its own path and there was 
nothing I had to watch out for. Of course, that still didn&#39;t quite 
justify my earlier liberation at peeking into my friends&#39; lives. 
&quot;Well, I...&quot; I began flustered, my mind not yet working right. &quot;That 
is...&quot;
	&quot;I always used to wonder what the angel looked like,&quot; Mint 
mused, cupping my face with one hand gently and keeping her eyes 
locked on my own for a long while. &quot;Now I know.&quot; I continued to stare 
at her in wonder, amazed at how... how simple, how naturally she was 
handling the situation. Wasn&#39;t she the least bit freaked. What was 
about her and Cless. She didn&#39;t know yet after all what I had 
learned... Mint giggled at my partial blank expression and to my 
renewed surprise placed another, this time fluttering light kiss on my 
lips. &quot;I used to have a crush on that angel too.&quot;
	I blinked, not expecting this at all. Had I with my at first 
unintended visits unconsciously cleared a path for what I only later 
learned my heart longed for? How ironic was that? There I had spent so 
many times lamenting over the unfairness of knowing so much about time 
and not being able to do anything to make things better. And now... I 
wasn&#39;t sure how to take this.
	&quot;Mint, I... I don&#39;t know what to say, really... What about...&quot;
	&quot;Cless?&quot; she asked, anticipating the question.
	I nodded.
	&quot;You know, don&#39;t you. About him being my half-brother.&quot;
	My carefully constructed image of Mint, the gentle girl with 
such refreshing innocent and a touch of naivety began to crumble away 
more and more. &quot;What? How?&quot; was the only thing that came out of my 
mouth. It had been such a shock when I learned that Cless&#39; father had 
been responsible for Merril Adnade&#39;s pregnancy. Before today, I hadn&#39;t 
been sure how I was supposed to tell them that. They had been so close 
and all of us were certain they&#39;d be married someday in the future.
	&quot;A week ago actually. Cless and I were looking through his... 
our father&#39;s house... or what is left of it, and found some old stuff, 
including an old diary. We drew our own conclusions,&quot; Mint admitted 
seriously and surprisingly composed. I would have expected more... 
well, I don&#39;t know. But I had thought she would take such news harder. 
After all it pretty much shattered the possibility between her and 
Cless... unless they didn&#39;t care about it... But that didn&#39;t make much 
sense either. Why should Mint have kissed me back then... which I was 
still having a hard time believing by the way.
	I had to have looked rather incredulous too, as these thoughts 
went through my head. Mint separated, much to my displeasure, and went 
over to Martel where she sat down in the grass, leaning with the back 
against the trunk. Holding out one hand, her intentions were rather 
clear even without the worlds. &quot;Come on, Arche. Sit down here.&quot;
	A bit uncertainly I followed the request and settled against the 
massive trunk of the old yet vital tree. Again a period of silence 
elapsed that made me quite uneasy and I was rather glad than Mint 
decided to pick up where she had left off, answering that which I had 
been wondering about. &quot;Even before that though, Cless and I... Well, 
we realized that what we felt for each other was a bit different from 
lover&#39;s love.&quot; Mint winked. &quot;Not that Cless still wasn&#39;t a cutie.&quot;
	I laughed, reliving some tension. &quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;
	We shared a knowing smile, this time in blissful silence. I was 
once more reminded how much I missed this. Those moments between us, 
when we had managed to slip away from the men. Mint was easy to get 
along with. She was rather uncomplicated and had an open ear for 
everyone&#39;s concerns. Sitting here now also made more clear to me that 
maybe those feelings hadn&#39;t just simply started to form after our 
departure. The seed, the seed had been planted earlier. I just never 
recognized it.
	I hesitated to do or say anything, not quite certain if what 
just happened had just been a spur of the moment thing. Maybe she had 
just been carried away by the moment or didn&#39;t want to deliberately 
hurt me or something. I really had no idea. There wasn&#39;t a need for me 
to act though. Once again Mint took the initiative and I could only 
watch with a mixture of fondness and confusion as the younger girl 
rested her head against my shoulder, looking rather comfortable and 
without a care in the world.
	&quot;Mint?&quot; I asked quietly as the blonde made no move to further 
explain herself.
	&quot;Hmm?&quot; was the reply, blue eyes looking up at me with... 
affection.
	&quot;Aren&#39;t you, um, freaked? Confused a little? I just...&quot; I 
trailed off, finding the entire situation more and more bizarre.
	Mint seemed genuinely puzzled for a moment. Then her eyes lit up 
in realization though, her features softened into a warm smile and she 
nestled her head back against my shoulder. &quot;Nah. I always wanted to be 
with my angel. Besides, it feels right. And Mother always told me that 
I should trust my feelings.&quot;
	See, simple and uncomplicated. I could only stare in amazement 
at the human woman rested comfortably against me, her eyes 
half-closed, marveling at the strange twists time had played on our 
lives. I had felt so guilty previously when I had watched the events 
that eventually led them to meeting Klarth and my past self. It had 
taken EVERY OUNCE of self-discipline that I possessed not to fry the 
bastard who had killed Mint&#39;s mother under Dhaos&#39; control. This was so 
weird. So unreal. So... so...
	&#39;Ah, what the hell! She didn&#39;t freak, she kissed you back! What 
else do you want, Arche?&#39;
	Closing my eyes I leaned my own head back against the ancient 
wood and slipped an arm around the younger woman&#39;s shoulders, letting 
my hand play with some blond strands. &quot;If you say so. I always thought 
your mother was a wise woman.&quot;
	It was true. What was I complaining? Unexpected or not... Had I 
not wanted this? Nearly a century spent alone, with only a few outside 
contacts, I basked in the closeness shared between Mint and I now. And 
I think I knew now that it was true after all. Love grew over time. 
Sometimes you didn&#39;t realize, sometimes you would spent your life not 
seeing it for what it really was. But I knew now. And Mint was 
correct. It felt right. Simple as that. I smiled at the irony. A 
century older, nearly two decades spent struggling to come to terms 
with all that I learned, including my feelings. And in the end, it 
turned out to be that easy, that simple.
	&quot;I love you,&quot; I mumbled, feeling at home for the first time in a 
long while. Right where I belonged. There wasn&#39;t a reply but I didn&#39;t 
need one. Not really anyway.

THE END

No, really. ^_^
Now, don&#39;t look at me. I know this was... um, don&#39;t even know what it 
was. Frankly the story started out as a lemon idea, warped into 
something more and then I began some weeks ago, it rested a little 
while in my hard drive and then I took it up again... It didn&#39;t quite 
turn out the way I expected to be honest.
I realize Mint was a little... off? Arche I pretty much explained. You 
know after hundred years and all that.
The problem with RPGs, especially such old one&#39;s is that there is a 
much left open about the characters, much left to interpret as we 
author&#39;s find suitable. It&#39;s not really that I choose to make Mint 
this way, the story developed more a life of its own at that point and 
so did the characters. I liked it enough, so I let it work out. Not 
exactly what I had planned but... oh well. There might be a sequel. 
MIGHT. With big, capital letters. I have something in mind but that 
all depends on free time etc., etc.

So bear with me, if the characters seem a little off. I take full 
responsibility for the idea of making Cless and Mint siblings. It is 
possible. We never got to know anything about Mint&#39;s father as far as 
I know, so I could slip in the possibility here.

That&#39;s all from me. Feedback, as always, is appreciated, welcomed and 
hungrily awaited. Good, bad, it&#39;s all the same as long as you try to 
stay constructive and don&#39;t cross a personal line.

There are too few Mint/Arche fics (actually there is barely any). 
Write more! Take this as the initiative.

Ja ne, yours
