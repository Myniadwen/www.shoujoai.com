<h1>Revenge Road (part 9 of 9)</h1>

<a href="../macross/revroad-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;Lord Megatron,&quot; the large, purple grey transformer
said in his cold way, &quot;the humans are... dangerously
erratic.&quot;

&quot;True, Shockwave,&quot; Megatron nodded grimly, the grey
skinned figure looking up from his command chair in
their base in the sunken warship Nemesis. &quot;They&#39;re
almost as annoying as the Autobots,&quot; he added then
frowned, &quot;And why are the Autobots still running free
on Cybertron? You told me you&#39;d eliminate them within
a cycle.&quot;

There was no defensiveness in Shockwave&#39;s voice as he
said in his usual efficient manner, &quot;The diversion of
resources to this front has made a final resolution to
the Autobot problem more complicated to achieve.&quot;

Soundwave nodded as the blue cassette player
Decepticon said coldly, &quot;Resource allocation
problematical.&quot;

That was something of a understatement. The DEcepticon
command had multiple fronts to manage, including the
Earth conflict, putting out rebellious fires on
Cybertron and the recent launch of Thunderwing&#39;s
exploration fleet... though more accurately it could
be considered a fleet of military conquest. When
Megatron first authorized Thunderwing the Earth forces
hadn&#39;t deployed their Veritechs, and if he changed his
mind now he would be shown up before the rank and file
of Decepticons.

&#39;And Thunderwing is too ambitious not to seize any
advantage he can,&#39; Megatron mentally added, &#39;it&#39;s that
very ambition that made me decide he and his allies
need to be sent far away from Cybertron.&#39;

&quot;We have successfully destroyed one of their new
outposts,&quot; Soundwave said after a moment, &quot;but the
Humans&#39; Fortresses are remarkably resilient.&quot;

All of them took a moment to look at the map of the
Earth, taking in the sea based Fortress carriers bases
scattered around the globe. Formerly ten of them there
were now nine, cruising on patrol to be ready to
launch their cargo of fighters and mecha to counter
Decepticon activities. Marked in blue they were a
secondary threat to the glowing red dot in North
America, the accursed Autobot City.

&quot;We need more numbers,&quot; Megatron growled, &quot;we have to
attack them while preventing the others from coming to
their aide.&quot;

&quot;We can reduce our garrison on Cybertron,&quot; Shockwave
conceded after a moment, &quot;but it will increase the
possibility of a uprising of the surviving Autobots
there.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s enough &#39;Bots to be a threat?&quot; Rumble asked,
the mini-transformer leaning casually up against
Soundwave&#39;s leg.

&quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; Shockwave conceded with some
reluctance, &quot;getting exact information on the Autobot
resistance has proven difficult. They skulk like
cyber-rats in the tunnels and ruins below the
cities...&quot;

&quot;And your agents?&quot; Megatron asked.

&quot;Dealer has been less than forthcoming,&quot; Shockwave
said coldly, &quot;I may soon have to take steps.&quot;

&quot;Offer him more energon,&quot; Rumble laughed, &quot;he&#39;ll fall
into line.&quot;

&quot;Dealer is ultimately a self serving being,&quot; Megatron
agreed, &quot;pay him, get the data then dispose of him.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll so instruct my lieutenant, Octane,&quot; Shockwave
said respectfully.

&quot;Have Reflector and Ratbat recon the nearest
Fortress,&quot; Megatron ordered coldly, &quot;we need to know
their weaknesses if we are to be victorious.&quot;

Soundwave launched a cassette, the purple flat
rectangle unfolding in midair into a bat-like robot.
&quot;Ratbat, take Reflector, Operation: reconnasance.&quot;

With a piercing cry Ratbat took off, sweeping out of
the control room to retrieve it&#39;s fellow Decepticon.
Not long after the bat soared away from the undersea
home of the Decepticons, carrying in it&#39;s claws the
cameras mode of the spy, Reflector.

Explosions rippled across the night sky as a squad of
Veritchs chased after their prey. &quot;All right team,&quot;
Izzy Randal said briskly as the green haired pilot
fired off a flight of missiles, &quot;let&#39;s wrap this up.&quot;

&quot;Anyone got an ID on this one?&quot; Rick Hunter asked, the
younger pilot taking up the left flank position. The
black haired man kept his finger in the triggers even
as he swept forward with his wing mates.

&quot;His colors match Ramjet,&quot; Max Sterling said crisply
as the blue haired man smiled slightly, &quot;and his
behavior, too.&quot;

The slightly crazed Decepticon had rammed Ben Dixon&#39;s
fighter, sending it spiraling away though thankfully
Ben was able to eject safely. What had followed was a
mad chase across the skies as they tried to catch or
exhaust their mad foe.

&quot;Ramjet,&quot; Izzy used her radio again, &quot;this is a RDF
patrol. Surrender, and we might not blow you out of
the sky...&quot;

&quot;Never!&quot; Ramjet yelled as the black and red jet swung
around, diving at Izzy,

With a steely calm Izzy opened up, firing high density
slugs into her foe along with launching a full flight
off missiles. Pulling a lever in the cockpit she
shifted to guardian mode as Ramjet barreled out of the
smoke and dodged his attempt to ram, then hovered on
boot jets as she fired into his vulnerable engines.

They watched as the explosion ripped his engines
apart, heart the wailing cry them watched as the
transformer hit the mountainside. In a flare of light
it was over, the gutted wreckage burning cheerfully in
the dim twilight.

&quot;All right,&quot; Izzy said briskly, &quot;we&#39;ll guard the site
until a recovery team gets here.&quot; Then she radioed the
nearest Fortress carrier, giving their location and
requesting the pickup of a Decepticon corpse.

&quot;Anyone up for some cards?&quot; Max joked as they all
switched to guardian or battleoid modes, taking up
guard positions around the area.

Within twenty minutes the team arrived, destroids
setting up a perimeter defense while tech crews
scrambled over Ramjet, hooking him to carry lines as
they prepared to haul him away. &quot;Thanks for the help,&quot;
the brown haired technician called.

&quot;I still don&#39;t see why we couldn&#39;t have carried it to
you,&quot; Rick complained.

&quot;Wanna risk dropping one again, flyboy?&quot; another tech
spoke up, her eyes twinkling with amusement as Claudia
LaSalle supervised her team.

Rick flushed. &quot;It just happened the one time,&quot; he
sighed.

&quot;Once is enough,&quot; Max murmured.

&quot;We&#39;ll leave it to the pros,&quot; Izzy said firmly, &quot;let&#39;s
move out!&quot;

In a well practiced move the squad of veritechs
reverted to fighter mode and raced off, shifting to a
combat formation. Sonic booms split the sky as they
traveled, only decelerating when they reached Fortress
One. One by one they cruised in, lines and nets
slowing them to a stop, then they climbed out and road
the elevators down into the belly of the ship.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; one of the flight crew said eagerly,
&quot;heard you bagged another one!&quot;

&quot;Never mind that,&quot; Izzy waved that off, &quot;how&#39;s Dixon?&quot;

&#39;Isn&#39;t that interesting,&#39; Rick blinked. At one time
all Randal seemed to care about her Decepticon
kills... something had changed about her.

&quot;He&#39;s concussed, but I hear his helmet saved him from
any worse injury,&quot; the crew member said quickly.

&quot;Good,&quot; Izzy nodded, looking relieved. Her first
impulse was to check in with Lisa, but she quashed
that. &#39;My commanding officer is not my security
blanket,&#39; she reminded herself. &quot;Okay,&quot; she addressed
her team, &quot;dismissed.&quot;

Meanwhile, up on the bridge Claudia Grant smiled as
the dusky skinned woman looked at her fellow officer.
&quot;You know you want to go down and see her,&quot; she
teased.

Lisa Hayes blushed as the brown haired officer tried
to look serious. &quot;I do not,&quot; she protested, &quot;I&#39;m sure
Izzy&#39;s fine.&quot;

&quot;I heard someone crashed...&quot; Claudia purred.

&quot;Dixon, again,&quot; Sammy Young noted from where the
darker brown haired young woman worked filing
paperwork.

&quot;You&#39;re spoiling it,&quot; Claudia rolled her eyes.

Lisa fought back a chuckle. &quot;I&#39;ll go see her after
shift, okay?&quot; she told Claudia.

&quot;That&#39;ll do,&quot; Claudia conceded.
