<a href="../macross/evatech-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>&quot;Shinji! Shinji!&quot; his father called as Gendo hurried
down the hall, his white labcoat flapping as the tall,
black haired man moved.

&quot;Oh god,&quot; Shinji whimpered, the brown haired young man
reluctantly waiting for his father to catch up. &quot;Yes?&#39;
he turned, his military uniform as crisp as ever.

Gendo pushed up his glasses as he fixed Shinji with a
glance, &quot;What&#39;s this I hear about you dating two women
at a time?&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Shinji visibly winced, imagining that the rumors
must be all over the ship by now to have finally
reached his father. &quot;Min-Mei&#39;s friend Miryia has just
been hanging around us...&quot; he started to explain.

&quot;I knew it,&quot; Gendo cut him off with a forceful slap to
his shoulder. His eyes streamed tears suddenly, &quot;I&#39;m
sure your mother in heaven is proud that she has a sun
manly enough to satisfy two women!&quot;

&quot;Dad!&quot; Shinji blushed.

Suddenly regaining his composure Gendo nodded
seriously to his son. &quot;You must bring the girls over
so I can meet them,&quot; he said to Shinji with a
dangerous gleam in his eyes, &quot;we need to be sure their
suitable.&quot;

Shinji sweatdropped, &quot;Right.&quot;

&quot;Come by the lab,&quot; Gendo added as he strode off down
the corridor, &quot;I have a new fighter type for you to
test out!&quot;

&quot;When hell freezes over,&quot; Shinji muttered as he
hurried off down the hall, glad that he was off shift
at last. Training young pilots was murder, especially
doing it with Rei and Asuka heading up their own
training flights. Thankfully today was quieter, though
Rei and Min-Mei were both caught up with all the
rehearsals for the pageant.

The city contained within the belly of the SDF-1 was
as busy as ever, people rushing about as they tried to
maintain something resembling a normal life. Following
a familiar route down crowded streets Shinji arrived
in the Chinatown like area where a familiar green
haired lady waited for him.

&quot;Shinji,&quot; Miryia nodded a greeting, dressed in her
usual long pants and simple, almost military styled
top.

&quot;Sorry I&#39;m still in uniform,&quot; Shinji apologized as
they fell into step, &quot;I didn&#39;t have enough time to
change before getting here.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Miryia smiled back slightly, &quot;I&#39;m
more comfortable with you in that sort of dress
anyway.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Shinji nodded, moving aside to dodge a mother
and her children.

&quot;Small Micronians...&quot; Miryia murmured, shaking her
head as a faint shudder ran through her form.

&quot;I hope we&#39;re in time to hear Min-Mei&#39;s song,&quot; Shinji
frowned, apparently not noticing the woman&#39;s reaction
to the children.

&quot;Shinji...&quot; Miryia started while they made their way
down the street.

Shinji looked over at her curiously, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;You and Min-Mei,&quot; Miryia said quietly, &quot;you&#39;re a
couple, yes?&quot;

Shinji blushed, then nervously scratched at his chin.
&quot;Well,&quot; he said a bit uncomfortably, &quot;we&#39;re working on
it.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;ve,&quot; Miryia made herself ask, &quot;kissed?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Shinji answered, wondering where she was going
with this.

&quot;What&#39;s it like?&quot;

Shinji looked over at her in surprise, &quot;You don&#39;t
know?&quot;

Miryia realized she had asked the wrong sort of
question and quickly fell back on her normal cover
story. &quot;I don&#39;t remember,&quot; she answered a bit crossly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Shinji said as they reached the busy
theater where the rehearsals were going on. He and
Miryia both showed their visitor passes and were
ushered in by the tall, grim man guarding the door.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Miryia said a bit stiffly. A bit
more gently she said, &quot;It&#39;s just, everyone else seems
to know about it while I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s got to be tough,&quot; Shinji agreed. They
navigated through the hall to the inner theater, where
rows of seats waited around the busy stage. The over
the top announcer Kaworu Nagisa blathered on, but
neither of them were listening as they made their way
to a seat.

Miryia gave Shinji a speculative look as she sat down,
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you could show me the kiss?&quot;

Shinji nearly choked on that idea. &quot;Not a good idea,&quot;
he coughed, &quot;especially if Min-Mei caught us at it.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Miryia looked confused.

&quot;Long story,&quot; Shinji sighed.

Miryia was going to press him for more details when
she was distracted by what was going on down on stage.
A blonde haired woman strode out dressed in a uniform
that Miryia didn&#39;t recognize, two pieces of cloth that
barely held in her breasts and concealed her sex.

&quot;What is THAT?&quot; Miryia demanded, shocked by the sudden
pounding of her heart.

&quot;The swimsuit competition,&quot; Shinji answered mildly.
She looked over, a bit surprised to see how pale she
was. &quot;Do you have a nosebleed?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Miryia quickly mopped up the blood. &#145;What
is wrong with me?&#39; she wondered as she tried to reign
in her rapidly beating heart.

&quot;And now,&quot; Kaworu waved grandly, &quot;Lynn Min-Mei!&quot;

With some relief Miryia saw that she was dressed in
something more modest, but the simple one piece still
clung to her body as the black haired girl strode from
the side to stand center stage, turning so that
everyone could see her from all angles.

&quot;She&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Miryia found herself saying almost
unwillingly.

&quot;That she is,&quot; Shinji agreed.

&quot;All right,&quot; Kaworu said briskly, &quot;on to the musical
numbers! Mana, you&#39;re up first!&quot;

Miryia sat forward in her chair, listening in obvious
contentment. While viewing kissing had caused strange,
violent emotions to rise within her, music was
different. It seemed to reach out to something
sleeping within her, touching a part of herself that
she had never been aware of.

&quot;Here she comes,&quot; Shinji said as the first few songs
ended.

Min-Mei took center stage as if she owned it, singing
&quot;My Boyfriend is a Pilot&quot; with heart and passion.
Miryia felt tears tease the corners of her eyes as she
listened, and her heart soared in her chest. All too
soon her song ended, but it&#39;s echoes sang within
Miryia for many minutes afterward.

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Miryia puffed out happily.

&quot;That she is,&quot; Shinji agreed, clearly not nearly as
touched by her song as Miryia had been. He smiled, &quot;I
have to wait till Rei performs, to show solidarity
with my wingman, but do you want to go see Min-Mei
back stage?&quot;

Miryia hesitated only a second, &quot;Thank you Shinji.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Shinji smiled, &quot;tell her she was great
for me.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Miryia nodded as she strode off
confidently.
