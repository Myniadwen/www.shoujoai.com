<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 9 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../macross/index.html">Macross</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../macross/evatech-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        &quot;So how are the wedding plans going?&quot; Makoto asked from his 
usual station, monitoring the communications traffic to and from the 
fortress.

        &quot;Progressing,&quot; Maya beamed. &quot;I&#39;m going to be wearing the suit, 
we think,&quot; she confided softly, &quot;and Ritsuko will be in the dress.&quot;

        &quot;Nice,&quot; Makoto smiled slightly.

        Maya looked back over her shoulder at the snoozing Misato, 
slouched down in her seat and snoring softly. &quot;Do you think she&#39;ll do 
that through the entire shift?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Count your blessings,&quot; Makoto chided her, &quot;we&#39;re lucky the 
enemy is still licking their wounds over the last battle.&quot; He paused, 
&quot;And it&#39;s certainly quieter up here when she&#39;s asleep.&quot;

        &quot;I heard that,&quot; Misato said before seemingly falling back 
asleep.

        Both her junior officers looked towards her nervously, 
sweatdropping. &quot;I just wish I could be down there with Sempai,&quot; Maya 
finally sighed.

        Makoto&#39;s mouth twitched with a smile, thinking of how Ritsuko 
blushed when Maya called her that. &quot;She is head of fighter command,&quot; he 
noted, &quot;the duty falls to her.&quot;

        &quot;I know,&quot; Maya admitted.

        Ritsuko Akagi sneezed suddenly, nearly blowing the papers off 
the office desk. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Rei Ayanami asked mildly.

        &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Ritsuko shook her head, &quot;don&#39;t know what came over 
me.&quot; She pushed her blonde hair back, tidying it once again.

        &quot;You wanted to see us, ma&#39;am?&quot; Shinji Ikari asked, the black 
haired young man standing stiffly at attention.

        &quot;Yes, I did,&quot; Ritsuko said.

        The commander paused, looking the two of them over. Once they 
had been two of the worst problem cases in the entire crew, two pilots 
so dangerous that no one wanted to be assigned to them. Thought to be a 
little mad, they had really earned the nickname of the Angels of Death. 
But now they seemed to have changed, pilots now putting their all in the 
defense of ship and crew rather than due to some self-destructive 
impulses. She wasn&#39;t certain why they changed, but she had a theory.

        &quot;What you did a few days ago,&quot; Ritsuko consulted her papers, 
&quot;was reckless, foolhardy and very nearly got one of you killed.&quot;

        &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Rei said simply, the blue haired woman looking 
straight ahead.

        &quot;It was so reckless and foolhardy that we&#39;ve been forced to give 
you both a commendation,&quot; Ritsuko rather enjoyed seeing the surprise on 
their faces as she continued on, &quot;and I have another piece of good news 
for you.&quot;

        Having heard her cue the connecting door slid open and a 
redheaded figure strode in the office. &quot;Hi, guys,&quot; Asuka grinned, 
dressed in her uniform once again, &quot;miss me?&quot;

        &quot;Asuka,&quot; Shinji pulled her into a hug, &quot;why didn&#39;t you tell us 
you were getting out of the hospital when we visited you yesterday?&quot;

        As soon as Shinji released her Rei stepped forward, silently 
pulling Asuka into another hug. &quot;It&#39;s good to have you back,&quot; she 
finally said softly.

        &quot;I&#39;ll leave you to your reunion,&quot; Ritsuko said as she collected 
her paperwork. &quot;You&#39;ve got today off, but we&#39;ll need you back flying 
patrols tomorrow,&quot; she said.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Asuka nodded with a grin. They followed Ritsuko out as 
she said, &quot;That was a hell of a fight you two pulled off, I&#39;m proud of 
you.&quot;

        &quot;Arigato,&quot; Rei thanked her softly, slipping unconsciously back 
into her native Japanese as her cheeks flamed red.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Shinji shrugged, a bit of a blush to his cheeks. With 
a frown he repeated, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell us you were getting out of the 
hospital?&quot;

        &quot;Because I didn&#39;t know for sure yet,&quot; Asuka explained patiently. 
&quot;I still had to undergo another physical, and if I failed I&#39;d still be 
in there.&quot;

        &quot;Well I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back,&quot; Rei said softly.

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Shinji agreed. He looked over at Rei as he added, &quot;We 
could really use you out there, too. She&#39;s not the best for planning.&quot;

        &quot;It worked, didn&#39;t it?&quot; Rei said mildly.

        Shinji groaned softly.

        Asuka shook her head with a wry grin, &quot;Yeah, you two...&quot; She 
tilted her head back with a relieved sigh, &quot;So you mind if we go into 
town for dinner? I want to get the taste of all that godawful hospital 
food out of my mouth.&quot;

        &quot;Little White Dragon?&quot; Rei suggested, knowing her leader&#39;s 
likes.

        &quot;You read my mind,&quot; Asuka agreed, throwing her arms over her 
wingmen&#39;s shoulders, not noticing the fierce blush that colored Rei&#39;s 
cheeks. &quot;Tonight we party, for tomorrow we go back out on our patrols!&quot; 
she declared.

        Less than an hour later the three were walking the streets of 
the city of Macross, taking in the crowds and the artificial skies far 
above them. It could almost have been any city in the world, except for 
the damage that remained from the battle against the two Angels only 
days ago.

        &quot;Asuka?&quot; Rei said quietly.

        &quot;Yeah?&quot; Asuka looked over at her curiously. She sometimes found 
herself wondering what her wingman might look in casual clothes, but 
firmly pushed the thought aside.

        &quot;How did you end up joining the defense force?&quot; Rei asked her 
curiously. She smiled a bit sadly, &quot;You know Shinji got pushed in by his 
father, and I had my... little accident in Gendo&#39;s lab. Everybody knows 
about us.&quot;

        Asuka tilted her head back, thinking a moment. &quot;I was caught up 
in the first spacefold, along with the city itself. I didn&#39;t want to be 
involved with the military, it just sort of happened. I tested out on 
the simulators then got into the defense force.&quot;

        Shinji looked over at her, &quot;And how did you get stuck with us, 
anyway?&quot;

        &quot;Because I punched out a grabby admiral,&quot; Asuka shrugged, &quot;I 
guess he figured that I wouldn&#39;t survive.&quot; An evil smile, &quot;Proved him 
wrong.&quot;

        They walked together a few moments before Rei quietly said, &quot;I 
suppose I should thank him, then.&quot; She smiled at Asuka, &quot;I&#39;m glad to 
have you.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Shinji seconded with a smile.

        Asuka felt her cheeks flaming. &quot;Thanks, guys,&quot; she said, feeling 
a bit of relief that they&#39;d reached the restaurant at last. She lead the 
way in, taking a deep breath of the lovely scents.

        &quot;Asuka,&quot; the manager beamed, the older woman clearly glad to see 
her. &quot;Minmei, you&#39;re friends are here,&quot; she called into the back.

        Minmei came out of the back, her eyes lighting up when she saw 
them. She hit Asuka with a flying hug, nearly knocking her over, &quot;I&#39;m so 
glad you&#39;re all right!&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m pretty tough, you know that,&quot; Asuka reminded her.

        Minmei smirked slightly, looking over at Shinji. &quot;Hello, 
Shin-chan,&quot; she softly drawled, &quot;it&#39;s good to see you again.&quot;

        Shinji felt his cheeks flush, &quot;Hi, Minmei.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll go get you your favorites,&quot; Minmei took off to the kitchen 
with a cheery wave, &quot;find a seat and I&#39;ll be right back!&quot;

        &quot;Shin-chan?&quot; Rei murmured, looked over at Shinji curiously.

        &quot;I... uh... stopped in here once or twice on my own,&quot; Shinji 
admitted.

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Asuka reassured him as the three claimed a 
table, &quot;just try to keep in mind that Minmei&#39;s more focused on her music 
and acting, all right? To her a boyfriend is more of an accessory than 
anything else.&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Shinji agreed, &quot;but she sure is cute.&quot;

        Asuka sighed softly.</pre>
