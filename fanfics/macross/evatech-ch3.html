<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 3 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../macross/index.html">Macross</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../macross/evatech-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>        Asuka puffed out a sigh of relief over hearing no major alerts 
going off as the three of them entered into the city itself. Macross, 
the city that the SDF-1 had accidentally taken along with them when 
they made their first attempt at a space fold. Rebuilt within the 
SDF-1&#39;s massive interior cavity the city had been restored near 
perfectly, the people there living their lives as normally as 
possible, considering the circumstances.

        &quot;I still don&#39;t understand why we have to go out drinking with 
you,&quot; Rei said mildly as she and Shinji followed Asuka down a 
pedestrian crowded street. People noted the military uniforms they 
wore and treated them with an odd mixture of respect and annoyance.

        &quot;Cause I need to trust my wingmen,&quot; Asuka said firmly, &quot;and I 
only trust people who&#39;ll go out drinking with me!&quot;

        Shinji blinked a few times as he tried to figure that one out, 
&quot;All right, I guess.&quot;

        &quot;First we&#39;ll head for the Little White Dragon for dinner,&quot; 
Asuka plotted cheerfully, &quot;then we&#39;ll go drink sake and embarrass 
ourselves doing karaoke!&quot;

        &quot;Oh, god,&quot; Rei muttered softly, following Asuka reluctantly.

        &quot;Oh, god..&quot; Misato whimpered, sitting her command chair as if 
she was in intense pain.

        &quot;Hung over again?&quot; Maya asked Ritsuko softly.

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Ritsuko sighed. She checked to see if anyone on 
the bridge was looking and reached over to lay her hand over Maya&#39;s.

        &quot;Oh sempai,&quot; Maya sighed happily.

        They were lucky that things were so quiet today. The Zentradi 
forces were following them from orbit as they continued their long 
search for someplace to off load the civilians, but they hadn&#39;t 
launched an attack for the last day or so. Ever since Asuka Langley 
and her two wingmen had killed off another Angel, actually.

        &quot;I still can&#39;t believe that Asuka willingly requested to be 
assigned back with the Angels of Death,&quot; Maya mused softly. She looked 
thoughtful, &quot;I wonder when the last time she had a full psych 
evaluation, anyway?&quot;

        &quot;I asked Gendo about it,&quot; Ritsuko answered her quietly, &quot;Asuka 
was actually worried about the two of them.&quot; She shook her head 
slightly, &quot;She actually volunteered to go out into battle in one of 
Gendo&#39;s prototypes!&quot;

        The two exchanged a long look before Maya sighed, &quot;She&#39;s 
nuts.&quot;

        &quot;Would you two mind keeping it down?&quot; Misato winced. She 
rubbed at her temples wearily, &quot;Asuka may be nuts, but she&#39;d the only 
pilot who&#39;s ever kept up with Shinji and Rei. Under the circumstances, 
we should just leave her be.&quot;

        &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Maya nodded firmly.

        Rei was looking down at the meal in moderate awe. &quot;I&#39;m 
impressed,&quot; she murmured, looking at the impressive piles of food.

        &quot;Hi, Asuka!&quot; a girl&#39;s voice gushed.

        &quot;Oh, no,&quot; Asuka muttered.

        A beautiful and clearly Chinese looking young woman appeared 
from in back dressed in a traditional school girl&#39;s uniform in blue 
and white. She practically leapt over the counter, giving them all a 
flash of her white panties before hugging Asuka fiercely, &quot;Where have 
you been!&quot;

        &quot;Hi, Minmei,&quot; Asuka smiled at her shyly.

        Rei and Shinji exchanged a glance, both wondering who this 
pretty girl was and why she had glommed onto Asuka that way.

        Minmei poked Asuka in the side, &quot;Introduce me to your 
friends.&quot;

        &quot;Rei, Shinji,&quot; Asuka was blushing slightly, &quot;I&#39;d like you to 
meet Minmei.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m her girlfriend,&quot; Minmei informed them with a big smile.

        &quot;No you are not,&quot; Asuka shot back.

        &quot;Yes I am,&quot; and Minmei suddenly threw her arms around a 
startled Asuka&#39;s neck and laid a fierce kiss right on her lips.

        &quot;Minmei,&quot; the older woman who seemed to be running the small 
restaurant gently scolded her, &quot;leave the poor girl alone for a 
minute, let her finish her meal.&quot; More quietly to Rei and Shinji she 
confided, &quot;Asuka help save Minmei from a mugging, and when her last 
boyfriend Hunter died, she developed a bit of a fascination for 
Asuka.&quot;

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Shinji nodded before scarfing more of his meal down.

        Rei gave him a withering look before gazing over at the 
fiercely blushing Asuka and Minmei. It was very hard to read her 
expressions normally, but at that moment it almost seemed as if she 
was jealous of something.

        &quot;Oh!&quot; Minmei bounced to her feet and said, &quot;Asuka, I&#39;ve bee 
practicing a new song, and I want you to hear it.&quot;

        &quot;Well, all right,&quot; Asuka blinked.

        Minmei climbed up on one of the tables, but not before making 
sure her feet were clean. With a broad smile she mimed having a 
microphone, &quot;This song is dedicated to Asuka, my hero.&quot;

        Asuka&#39;s face went beet red.

        &quot;Fly me to the moon, and let me play among the stars,
        Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars,
        In other words, please be true,
        In other words, I love you...&quot;

        Minmei&#39;s voice was sweet, filling up the room as she gazed 
down at the fiercely blushing Asuka with love in her eyes. Standing in 
the doorway, a faintly blushing Maya leaned on Ritsuko&#39;s shoulder as 
they let the song wash over them.

        &quot;That was lovely,&quot; Ritsuko finally murmured as the young woman 
finished her song. Oddly, she bounded down then planted herself firmly 
in Asuka&#39;s lap.

        Maya nodded, rendered silent by the song. The two women 
ordered quickly before sitting at one of the tables together, chairs 
close so that they could talk easier.

        &quot;Ritsuko,&quot; Maya said seriously, &quot;are we ever going to be able 
to be fully open about how we feel for each other?&quot;

        &quot;Most of the ship already knows about us,&quot; Ritsuko admitted, 
&quot;but if you mean officially, most probably not.&quot;

        &quot;I wish there was something we could do, sempai,&quot; Maya 
murmured, using the pet-name her lover so liked to hear.

        A slight smile and Ritsuko said, &quot;You know that ship&#39;s 
Captains can perform legally binding marriages, right?&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Maya blinked.

        &quot;I bet I could talk Misato into doing one for us,&quot; Ritsuko 
grinned.

        &quot;Oh, Sempai!&quot; Maya threw her arms around the older woman.
