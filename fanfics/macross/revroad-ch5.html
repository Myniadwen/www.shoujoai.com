surprised as the red and silver truck based Autobot
met Jetfire&#39;s eyes.

Jetfire nodded, the massive red and white jet Autobot
standing at attention as he gave his report, &quot;The
human Randal engaged Megatron in single combat.&quot;

&quot;I mourn the humans&#39; loss,&quot; Optimus sighed after a
moment.

&quot;That&#39;s the surprising thing,&quot; Jetfire noted, &quot;she
survived. Even managed to bang him up as bit before he
clipped her.&quot;

Optimus smiled slightly, &quot;He must have been furious.&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t happen to a nicer Decepti-crumb,&quot; Iron Hide
agreed from where the red painted autobot leaned up
against the wall. He moved off as he drawled, &quot;If she
was a Autobot, we&#39;d have given her a medal.&quot;

&quot;So how did the younger Autobots fare?&quot; Optimus asked.

&quot;Springer, Hotrod and Arcee did well,&quot; Jetfire calmly
reported, &quot;and they work quite well as a team, too.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Optimus said as he moved over to a access port
in Autobot City, or what Spike still insisted on
calling a window. &quot;They&#39;ll be working together,&quot; he
said, &quot;at least when Arcee&#39;s other duties allow.&quot;

&quot;And Arcee has agreed to this?&quot; Jetfire asked him
cautiously. He didn&#39;t want to seem to criticize, but
on the other hand he also felt he had a responsibility
to speak up for a younger officer if needed.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Optimus nodded. He paused, &quot;Is Kup around?&quot;

&quot;That old war horse?&quot; Jetfire smiled wryly as he said,
&quot;Yes, he&#39;s taken to keeping an eye on the new comers.&quot;

&quot;Have him find Arcee for me,&quot; Optimus said briskly, &quot;I
think it&#39;s time for her to start her new assignment.&quot;

Meanwhile, aboard the carrier Fortress One the sickbay
was filled with noise and discussion as the pilots
gathered around the bed, chattering madly. &quot;Ahem,&quot;
Lisa Hayes cleared her throat, startling the band of
pilots.

&quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am,&quot; Rick Hunter nodded to her respectfully
as he lead his comrades in a hasty retreat.

&quot;I thought you were getting some bed rest,&quot; Lisa said
as the brown haired officer strode over to the
bedside.

Izzy Randal smiled charmingly, &quot;I&#39;m in bed, resting.&quot;

Lisa rolled her eyes, &quot;I doubt your doctor would
approve of you entertaining your pilot buddies while
recovering.&quot;

&quot;Doctors are such tight asses,&quot; Izzy grumbled,
shifting a bit in her bed.

Lisa smiled slightly as she pulled over a chair,
looking at Izzy thoughtfully. &quot;Your color seems
better,&quot; she noted.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Izzy sighed, &quot;can I please get out of this
bed soon?&quot;

&quot;Pilots,&quot; Lisa rolled her eyes, &quot;it&#39;s only been a day
since Megatron shot you down, you know. And you had a
severe concussion too.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Izzy pouted.

&#145;She&#39;s so cute when she does that,&#39; Lisa thought with
some amusement. &quot;Have you heard the latest news?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;The gossips,&quot; Izzy referred to her fellow pilots
wryly, &quot;were having a lot of fun hinting at something,
but they wouldn&#39;t say exactly what.&quot;

&quot;You remember I asked you if you wanted to be a
liaison with the Autobots?&quot; Lisa asked.

Izzy looked wary, &quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;The Autobots have decided to assign one of their own
to be a liaison with us, instead,&quot; Lisa smiled
slightly.

&quot;Huh,&quot; Izzy looked faintly relieved, possibly because
she had wondered if command was going to try to compel
her to work with the Autobots. &quot;So what will this
liaison do?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Help coordinate mutual offences, provide us with
intelligence and generally offer any needed
assistance,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Frankly, I think Optimus
Prime and command got together on this in some kind of
public show of unity.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Izzy admitted. She stretched,
mincing a bit as she moved, &quot;So who&#39;s the Autobot
we&#39;ll have to deal with?&quot;

Lisa looked away, a blush coloring her cheeks as
Izzy&#39;s gesture thrust out her firm breasts, the shirt
she was wearing riding up to expose her toned belly.
&#145;Damn she looks good,&#39; she thought weakly. &quot;Actually
you&#39;ve met,&quot; Lisa said, &quot;the Autobot is Arcee.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Izzy blinked, thinking of the pink skinned
Autobot she had encountered twice now. &quot;Well,&quot; she
murmured, &quot;maybe command has actually had a half
decent idea.&quot;

&quot;From you that&#39;s high praise,&quot; Lisa smiled.

There was a moment&#39;s pause as Izzy&#39;s expression
hardened. &quot;How badly did the Decepticons hurt us?&quot; she
asked in a flat, dangerous tone.

&#145;The tone she used to use with all transformers,&#39; Lisa
noted, &#145;but lately mostly with just the Decepticons.
Wonder if she&#39;s noticed?&#39; Aloud she said, &quot;We lost
Fortress Four out in the Baltic Sea.&quot;

&quot;Crap,&quot; Izzy cursed softly, &quot;how many got out?&quot;

&quot;It went down with all hands,&quot; Lisa revealed
reluctantly, &quot;a new arrival from Cybertron named
Shockwave lead the assault.&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Izzy growled, clenching her hand around her
bed sheets. She closed her eyes, then opened them as
she said grimly, &quot;We need to be doing better than
this.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re doing all you can,&quot; Lisa said softly.

&quot;No, WE need to,&quot; Izzy turned in the bed to meet
Lisa&#39;s eyes, her own flashing with passionate
intensity. &quot;I barely scratched Megatron, and our
fighters can only stop a Decepticon in packs... we&#39;ve
got to change that,&quot; she insisted.

&#145;God, she&#39;s beautiful when she&#39;s angry,&#39; Lisa blinked.
Clearing her throat she said, &quot;I&#39;m sure Dr. Lang and
his team are doing everything they can.&quot;

Her momentary burst of energy tiring her Izzy lay
back, &quot;Well, they&#39;d better develop something soon.&quot; A
dangerous smile, &quot;I want another shot at Megatron.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll get it too,&quot; Lisa agreed, &quot;I&#39;m sure of it.&quot;
