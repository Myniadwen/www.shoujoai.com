<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 19 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../macross/index.html">Macross</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../macross/evatech-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Captain Misato Katsuragi watched the courier plane
land on the deck amid the supply planes that had been
coming in all day. The black haired woman fought back
a painful wince, her hangover pounding as she walked
back to her office desk and the report she was sending
back to command. She had better finish it, she had a
very good idea what orders the courier was bringing.

She skimmed the papers, Misato remembering everything
that had happened... The SDF-1 launching a automatic
attack against the arriving Zentradi forces, the
destruction of the orbital forts by the aliens then
the invasion. Getting her staff and pilots together in
the middle of pre-launch ceremonies they had
mobilized, launching conventional fighters and
Veritechs against the battlepods that fell against
Macross city.

Racing against time they launched the SDF-1, bringing
guns on-line to support the fighter wings even as they
tried to figure out what the hell was happening. Her
bridge crew had shone that day, Ritsuko managing all
the internal crisises of the ship even as Maya got the
fighters moving, working with the bridge crew to
reorganize wings on the fly and provide adequate
cover.

&quot;The space fold...&quot; Misato winced.

Wanting to get the battle away from populated regions
Misato had activated the spacefold system, targeting a
point between the Earth and the moon. Instead, the
field expanded uncontrolled and took the ship, two
aircraft carriers and much of the island to the far
side of the solar system. Thankfully most people were
in sealed shelters, but the mad scramble to save them
had been yet another Herculean effort for the already
stressed crew.

Gendo Ikari&#39;s proposal to reassemble Macross city in
the SDF-1&#39;s massive interior hold had seemed mad, but
in the end it was the only option they had to house
all of the refugees. The lead scientist behind
Robotechnology had even devised a way to keep the city
safe when the SDF-1 had to go through modular
transformation, a innovation required by the
mysterious disappearance of the vessel&#39;s spacefold
drives.

&quot;Of course that&#39;s where we started getting new crew,&quot;
Misato recalled. Rei Ayanami, Gendo&#39;s own lab
assistant and a victim of exposure to mutagenic
chemicals had joined the pilots, soon followed by
Shinji Ikari. Both ascended in rank and reputation,
soon earning the nickname the &#39;Angels of Death&#39; for
their skills and the many commanding officers they
went through.

Much more quietly Asuka Langley joined their ranks,
developing into a solid leader of men. She worked
alongside pilots like Hunter and Fokker, her steady
hand helping keep other pilots alive amid the battles
across the solar system.

The battle of Saturn&#39;s rings.. the Mars raid for
supplies.. their trip had been almost a constant
battle, one costing them much. The worst battle so far
had been breaking through the Zentradi screening force
around Earth, using the SDF-1&#39;s main guns and a
fighter wave to burst through the enemy cruisers and
battlepods.

A lot of ranking pilots had died that day, wings
broken, among them Roy Fokker. Asuka Langley was
bumped up to Lieutenant, even as Ikari and Ayanami in
Skull One were put under her command. It was intended
as a temporary measure, Asuka wasn&#39;t senior enough for
it, but remarkably it worked well. Except for a
temporary diversion to move Asuka to being a test
pilot she had stayed with her wingmates.

However their splashdown to Earth hadn&#39;t been met with
celebration. Earth command had declared the residents
of Macross dead, and refused to reverse that decision.
Even worse they felt that the SDF-1 should have
remained in space as a stalking horse for the
Zentradi... Combine all that with the recent barrier
explosion and things didn&#39;t look good.

There was a chime from her door and Misato called,
&quot;Enter.&quot;

The black haired, slightly scruffy man who walked in
really shouldn&#39;t have surprised Misato, she knew that
he had left the ship not long ago, but he still did.
Kaji managed to make the RDF uniform look rumpled as
he saluted, &quot;Good to see you, Captain.&quot;

&quot;Back at headquarters again?&quot; Misato inquired, looking
with some dread at the paperwork he carried, having a
very good idea what was in them. She ignored the
discomfort she felt with him, the shadow of their
affair hanging in the air between them.

&quot;I was attached to the UE observers,&quot; Kaji reminded
her, &quot;I only assisted with fighter command because of
lack of personnel.&quot;

&quot;And now you&#39;re running errands for headquarters,&quot;
Misato noted.

&quot;We serve where we can,&quot; Kaji answered. He extended
the packet of papers even as he quietly murmured,.
&quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;Let command know that I&#39;m accepting these orders
under protest,&quot; Misato sighed, taking the packet from
him. She opened the seals and read quickly, knowing
almost exactly what they were going to say.

&quot;The SDF-1 is hereby ordered to leave Earth-space,&quot;
the crisp text read, &quot;and engage the Zentradi forces
away from civilian targets. All resources available
will be provided, however civilians currently aboard
the SDF-1 must stay aboard due to security concerns.&quot;

&quot;Security concerns,&quot; Misato bit out, feeling a flash
of anger.

Kaji met her eyes sympathetically, &quot;If it helps any,
the United Earth government is pretty divided on the
issue.&quot; A grim smile, &quot;If you can last long enough
it&#39;s quite possible that the decision might be
overturned.&quot;

&quot;I intend to do everything I can to keep this ship and
crew alive,&quot; Misato said firmly, shaking Kaji&#39;s hand
before he left.

Kaji surprised her by pulling her into a hug, &quot;Watch
out for yourself.&quot;

Misato felt a hand slip down and squeeze her butt and
she pushed him away firmly as she said, &quot;Watch the
hands.&quot; With a impish grin he slipped out, leaving her
alone with her thoughts and the difficult duty that
was ahead of her, telling ship and crew they were
going into exile.

Meanwhile in another part of the ship a line up of
young women waited nervously, talking among
themselves. Mirya raised a eyebrow as she asked, &quot;What
are you doing here again?&quot;

Minmei smiled, shifting nervously in the party dress
she wore as she said, &quot;This is where I apply to enter
the Miss Macross pageant.&quot;

&quot;And what am I doing here?&quot; Mirya pressed on. Her
simple clothes made her stand out, as did her fierce
attitude to anyone who might think to trouble her
younger charge.

&quot;You&#39;re my bodyguard,&quot; Minmei shrugged.

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Mirya sighed.

Minmei chuckled softly, holding her arm as she studied
the line, taking in the competition as well as looking
for any familiar faces. Surprisingly she recognized a
bridge officer, a boyish young woman who stood with a
tall blonde.

&quot;Do I have to do this?&quot; Maya asked with a sigh,
running her hand through her short brown hair, her
uniform crisply starched

&quot;Sorry love,&quot; Ritsuko smiled down at her girlfriend
gently, &quot;but the Captain wanted someone from the
bridge in the contest.&quot;

&quot;You could always enter,&quot; Maya murmured, &quot;you&#39;re
beautiful.&quot;

Ritsuko blushed faintly, gently squeezing Maya&#39;s hand.
&quot;You&#39;re a charmer,&quot; she murmured, &quot;but you know I&#39;m
too old.&quot;

&quot;Never to me,&quot; Maya murmured, looking up to meet her
eyes.

From their spot in line Minmei murmured, &quot;How
romantic.&quot; Hearing no response from Mirya she looked
up, seeing the flushed cheeks of the other woman. &quot;Are
you all right?&quot; she asked worriedly, squeezing Mirya&#39;s
hand.

&quot;Just a bit surprised,&quot; Mirya conceded. This ship and
it&#39;s people baffled her, yet the occasional
familiarity confused her more. Watching those two had
reminded her of the all female ships she had served on
before, of the closeness that developed between
officers you admired....

&quot;I see you&#39;re here too,&quot; the amused voice said. Mirya
and Minmei turned to see Asuka Langley dressed
casually, and standing beside her, quite surprisingly,
was Rei Ayanami wearing a lovely sort of party dress,
white cloth setting off her red eyes and blue hair.

&quot;You&#39;re entering the pageant too, Rei?&quot; Minmei asked,
feeling just a little nervous. She knew she was a good
singer and cute, but Rei had a unearthly sort of
attractiveness to her that would be hard to compete
with.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Rei said to her calmly, &quot;unless they
allow us to bring in a Evangelion I will lose in the
talent portion.&quot;

Mirya look over at Minmei innocently, &quot;Would they
allow that?&quot;

&quot;I doubt it,&quot; Minmei giggled.

&quot;There you go,&quot; Asuka shrugged.. She smiled as she
surveyed the crowd of girls, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t have too
much trouble, Minmei.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Minmei blushed.

Mirya blinked, feeling a sudden emotion... of
jealousy?</pre>
