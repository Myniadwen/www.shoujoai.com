<a href="../macross/evatech-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>        Asuka stood in her quarters, stripping her flight suit off 
quickly and efficiently. In just her bra and panties Asuka paused to 
look in her mirror for a moment. A slim, athlertic young woman looked 
out at her, the almost flaming hair flowing over her shoulders.

        &quot;What am I doing?&quot; Asuka muttered to herself softly, turning to 
her closet.

        When she had invited Rei out to dinner tonight she hadn&#39;t been 
expecting to feel this confused. After all, she had gone out with Rei 
and Shinji before, gotten drunk and even did kareoke together. But 
somehow, this felt different, maybe because it was just her and Rei on 
their own.

        A bit of a blush colored Asuka&#39;s cheeks as she thought back to 
that last drunken night out. Waking up laying in there Rei&#39;s bed, the 
blue haired young woman sleeping peacefully beside her had been quite an 
experience. Especially when Rei had slipped from the bed, slinking about 
the room in just panties and T-shirt.

        &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m thinking about this,&quot; Asuka scowled, 
digging through the clothes. She held up one of her nicer dresses, then 
looked at a pair of black pants and T-shirt. &#39;Wonder how Rei is going to 
dress?&#39; she thought wryly.

        To make things even more confusing was reading Rei&#39;s typically 
deadpan expression. She just didn&#39;t seem to react to anything, from 
deadly danger to her near nudity that morning. &#39;Well, that isn&#39;t quite 
true,&#39; Asuka admitted. Over the months she had been working with Rei the 
girl had begun to open up, or Asuka was getting better at reading her, 
either way.

        With a sigh Asuka grabbed the shirt, buttoning up the white 
cotton over her equally white underwear. Then she sat down on the side 
of her bed and grabbed her pants, pulling the black garment up her legs 
before buttoning them up. A belt made sure the pants would stay up, then 
she paused in front of the mirror to brush her hair. Slipping her shoes 
on she put wallet and keys in her pockets and was out the door and gone.

        Asuka made her way through the corridors of the SDF-1, nodding 
slightly in recognition to those people she knew. What she didn&#39;t notice 
was the warm glances she got, the officers looking at her admiringly as 
they passed by. She had a reputation, Asuka Langley, one that was 
growing more and more with the telling. The commanding officer who kept 
up with the Angels of Death, one of the youngest pilots to make ace, and 
more and more accomplishments. Still, she remained unaware of the legend 
growing around her and her wingmates.

        Asuka hesitated at the door, then she rang the bell. Oddly, no 
sound echoed inside and she noticed the door was slightly ajar. Pushing 
it open a bit she called out, &quot;Rei? It&#39;s Asuka.&quot;

        &quot;Come on in,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice called back.

        Asuka pushed the front door open, walking into the set of rooms 
that was now mildly familiar to her. After looking around she stepped 
into the bedroom, looking around her curiously as the door to the shower 
slid open.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rei stepped out, her body damp from the shower, a 
towel wrapped around her slim body, &quot;I&#39;m running a little behind.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Asuka repeated, backing up so that she thumped up 
against the wall, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean... I didn&#39;t realize you were....&quot;

        Rei took a step forward, apparently unaware that the towel she 
was wearing was slipping down as she said, &quot;It&#39;s all right, Asuka.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Asuka squeaked out.

        Rei flashed a slightly impish smile, tugging her towel back up a 
bit as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll be ready to go in a moment.&quot; She went to where a 
white dress lay on her bed, her back to Asuka as she softly said, &quot;You 
look good in that.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Asuka managed to get out, her eyes widening as Rei 
simply let the towel drop to the floor. The nude young woman picked up a 
pair of lacy panties, bending over to pull it on and providing a lovely 
view of her rounded bottom. Then she lifted her dress from the bed, 
smoothly pulling it over her head to let it gently settle down around 
her body.

        Rei reached around her back, trying to get her zipper pulled up. 
&quot;Could you...&quot; she looked over her shoulder at Asuka warmly.

        &quot;Sure,&quot; the mildly pale Asuka stepped up, carefully grabbing the 
zipper and pulling it up as the delicate scent of soap and shampoo 
washed over her. She laid the tab down smoothly, patting Rei on the back 
gently.

        Rei smiled up at Asuka as she murmured, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

        Asuka cleared her throat, a bit of a blush to her cheeks. &quot;I was 
wondering,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;where you wanted to go?&quot;

        Rei clearly looked amused at the effect that she was having on 
Asuka, &quot;Do you have someplace in mind?&quot;

        Asuka smiled a bit sheepishly, &quot;Little White Dragon?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Rei said. She sat on the side of her bed, 
slipping white socks and her shoes on then getting up to take Asuka&#39;s 
arm. &quot;Shall we go?&quot; she asked.

        Shinji pushed his black hair back, wishing he had gotten it 
trimmed last time. He looked good in his casuals and the boquet of roses 
he carried wafte a delicate scent over him. &#39;guess I&#39;m as ready as I&#39;ll 
ever be,&#39; he mused, pushing open the door to the Little White Dragon.

        The resturant was crowded tonight, filled nearly to capacity by 
men and women of the city along with several off-duty pilots and crew 
members he recognized. He made his way through the press of people, 
waving cheerfully to the lady behind the counter.

        &quot;Head on upstairs,&quot; the older woman said to him cheerfully, 
&quot;Minmei is waiting there with a friend of hers.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks.&quot; Shinji waved. &#39;A friend of hers?&#39; he thought as he 
took the stairs up to the rooms on the second floor. He was feeling a 
bit disappointed that they wouldn&#39;t be alone, but he&#39;d manage. Besides, 
he hadn&#39;t met many of Minmei&#39;s friends yet.

        &quot;Shinji,&quot; Minmei beamed at him as she closed a door behind her. 
She ran forward in her simple summer dress and hugged him, then 
exclaimed happily over the roses he carried. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she brought 
the roses up to her face, breathing in the scent.

        &quot;They suit you,&quot; Shinji smiled slightly.

        Minmei got a vase out, putting the roses in water and carefully 
arranging them. &quot;Did my Aunt tell you about our guest?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;She mentioned something,&quot; Shinji shrugged.

        &quot;I found her just after one of the battles,&quot; Minmei sighed 
softly, &quot;she was hurt, and it looks like she doesn&#39;t remember anything.&quot;

        &quot;Ouch,&quot; Shinji winced, rubbing the back of his head. He 
hesitated a moment then asked, &quot;Do you want us to bring her with us?&quot;

        &quot;Would you mind?&quot; Minmei smiled. She looked up at him with a 
smile, &quot;It might help her to see more of the city, maybe.&quot;

        &quot;Well, why not,&quot; Shinji shrugged. He smiled slightly, &quot;I was 
sort of expecting to have Asuka and Rei tagging along, this isn&#39;t much 
different.&quot;

        &quot;So where are they?&quot; Minmei raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;Going out to dinner together,&quot; Shinji explained.

        &quot;Isn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Minmei said, leading him down the 
hall. She tapped on the closed spare bedroom door and asked, &quot;Miriya?&quot;

        The door opened a second later, a green haired young woman 
standing in the doorway dressed in borrowed man&#39;s clothes. &quot;Minmei,&quot; she 
nodded then looked curiously as Shinji.

        &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Shinji Ikari,&quot; Minmei said cheerfully.

        Shinji nearly frowned as he looked at the young woman. &#39;Where 
have I seen her befotre?&#39; he wondered. After Minmei jabbed him lightly 
he stuck out his hand, &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot;

        Miriya took it, shaking with a thoughtful expresion on her face. 
&quot;Indeed,&quot; she murmured.

        &quot;Well,&quot; Minmei said cheerfully as she grabbed both of their arms 
and tugged them forward, &quot;let&#39;s get going.&quot;

        Shinji gave Miriya a helpless look behind Minmei&#39;s back and the 
young woman replied with a hesitant smile and a slight shrug.</pre>
