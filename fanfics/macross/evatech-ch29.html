<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 29 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../macross/index.html">Macross</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../macross/evatech-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><pre>Explosions lit up the night as Breetai winced, the giant Zentradi 
sitting on the bridge of his flagship. &quot;They spotted our troops sooner 
than we thought,&quot; the big man rumbled, the half helmet that covered part 
of his face gleaming.

Exedore nodded thoughtfully, &quot;We knew they used more patrol craft than 
most of our enemies... it was a calculated risk.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Breetai murmured, watching the battle unfold on a screen set 
beside his chair. In the middle of the flight of battlepods several 
fighters spun and danced in the explosions of their deadly weaponry. All 
of the enemy craft fought well, but a blue trimmed fighter fought even 
better than most.

&quot;That&#39;s one of the three our warriors are most concerned about,&quot; Exedore 
said diplomatically as he recognized the vehicle&#39;s markings, &quot;they have 
a remarkable kill rate for our battlepods.&quot; Mentally he added, 
&#39;Concerned sounds better than terrified.&#39;

A technician who was monitoring the battle called out respectfully, 
&quot;Zor&#39;s ship is transforming again!&quot;

&quot;I often wonder why they&#39;ve done that,&quot; Exedore murmured, watching as 
the great ship changed form, eventually resembling a standing humanoid 
warrior.

&quot;They may have unlocked some new power of Protoculture,&quot; Breetai mused.

&quot;Sir, Quamzin is requesting permission to launch an attack,&quot; another 
warrior reported as more battlepods were destroyed on the view screen.

&quot;Have all the battlepods been spotted?&quot; Breetai asked thoughtfully as 
the battle waged hotter on the screen, reinforcements sweeping in to aid 
Earth&#39;s defenders.

&quot;Yes, Lord Breetai,&quot; another bridge member noted regretfully, &quot;once the 
first wing was spotted, the scouts on the other approach vectors were 
able to detect the other wings, too.&quot;

Breetai rose, frowning. &quot;If even one of our covert groups had broken 
through, it might have been worthwhile to follow up with a full 
assault,&quot; he said seriously, &quot;but without at least one, it would be 
simply a waste of vessels.&quot;

Meanwhile, on the bridge of a smaller vessel a hand smashed at a 
innocent control panel, the slim officer nearly shaking with rage. 
&quot;Cowardly fool!&quot; Quamzin yelped as he returned to his seat, &quot;Why will he 
not find his nerve!?&quot;

&quot;My lord,&quot; a officer replied tentatively, &quot;the gambit failed. The hidden 
ships were spotted too soon to carry out the plan.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Quamzin nearly leapt from his seat as he backhanded the 
Zentradi, his strength shocking from such a small man.

&quot;Ooof,&quot; the officer flew across the bridge, slamming against the far 
wall painfully.

&quot;Do not question me,&quot; Quamzin stalked back to his chair, turning to 
study the image in front of them. In a much more normal tone of voice he 
noted, &quot;See those discharges? They&#39;re going to fire the main gun again.&quot;

Indeed even as he spoke flashes of lighting danced between the massive 
twin booms which normally were on the front of the ship. A light welled 
up between then as forces built, then suddenly it was released as a 
scythe of destructive energy cut through the ships of the great Zentradi 
fleet. Each ship the bolt touched died in a burst of destructive energy, 
the attack too sudden to be countered and too powerful to stop.

&quot;Why do they change their ship that way?&quot; Quamzin wondered as they 
watched the wreckage of their ships fall from Earth&#39;s orbit to the 
planet below.

Another officer, braver than most, offered, &quot;Maybe it&#39;s a symbol to 
them?&quot;

&quot;They are a irrational breed,&quot; Quamzin conceded reluctantly, &quot;but I 
sense there is something more to it....&quot;

Out in the dogfight a Evangelion fighter exploded in flames and Shinji 
Ikari cursed softly, the brown haired pilot too far away to help. 
Wheeling around he raced in to reinforce the wing even as a green 
decorated fighter joined him. His eyes widened as they swept through the 
enemy in a blaze of fireballs, the other pilot keeping up with him as 
they tore into the enemy.

Noting the fighter&#39;s number Shinji punched it into the radio as he 
shifted to Guardian mode, the fighter hovering in mid air as it fired 
lethally. The face that appeared on his screen was that of a black 
haired man, his expression oddly pleasant as he destroyed battlepods 
left and right.

&quot;Lieutenant Ikari,&quot; Lynn Kyle said with a smile, &quot;hope you don&#39;t mind 
the assist.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Shinji smiled back as they fired, driving back a concentrated 
push even as more fighters arrived to support them, &quot;it was getting a 
little tense.&quot;

Kyle waved that aside, &quot;You were handling things, sir. I just sped 
things up a bit.&quot;

&quot;Ikari, Lynn,&quot; the bridge hailed them as Maya said, &quot;we&#39;re getting 
steady fire from several cruisers in the left quadrant. Can you do 
something about it?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Ikari said with a feral grin as they shifted back to fighter 
mode, rocketing off towards the Zentradi cruisers.

Bobbing and weaving through streams of enemy fire the two pilots reached 
the dark green skin of the alien craft, skimming along the surface as 
they fired on the exposed weapons mounts. They went up in brightly 
colored bursts of flame as the twin fighters swiftly pruned away the 
cruiser&#39;s offensive capability, then soared on to strike another one.

Kyle shook his head slightly as he and Shinji soared down at another 
cruiser as the first limped away. &#39;Incredible,&#39; he thought as he dodged 
a beam that would have pulped his Evangelion, &#39;Ikari has no wasted 
movement at all... he&#39;d be a natural martial artist.&#39;

Fire blossomed on the surface of the cruiser as Shinji unleashed a 
flight of missiles, then they soared in through the smoke to wreak 
havoc. &quot;Watch for fire from the left,&quot; Shinji warned as several 
battlepods tried to interfere.

&quot;I see them,&quot; Kyle flipped his Evangelion around in a move that looked 
more difficult than it was and opened fire, picking them off before 
returning to his strafing run.

&quot;Nice,&quot; Shinji smiled, then both were too preoccupied with battle to 
talk.

Within the SDF-1 there was both a sense of tension and a oddly relaxed 
feeling, the people within the ship having grown a bit complacent under 
the constant attacks. In the stadium where the Miss Macross contest was 
being held the biggest reaction seemed annoyance at the inconvenience of 
the modular transformation.

Kaworu pushed his white hair back as the young man smiled wryly, &quot;I 
wonder if this&#39;ll happen during the show?&quot; The group of contestants were 
all stuck in the stadium&#39;s safe zone as they waited for the ship to 
revert to normal and free them.

&quot;It better not!&quot; Satsuki Ooi growled, the lovely blonde pacing about as 
they waited for the battle to end. &quot;Damn it, couldn&#39;t they have waited 
till after we rehearse?!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think the Zentradi book their battles based on your schedule,&quot; 
Asuka Langley said dryly from where she waited by Rei.

&quot;Are you being smart?!&quot; Satsuki demanded.

&quot;Damn right,&quot; Asuka said dryly, seemingly entirely un-bothered by the 
actress&#39; famous temper tantrums.

&quot;Ah...,&quot; Something in Asuka&#39;s eyes caused the actress to stop her 
advance, making a humph sound before stalking back to her seat.

&quot;Well done,&quot; Rei Ayanami murmured, sitting close to her.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Maya Ibuki agreed, the boyish officer leaning up against a 
wall nearby, &quot;I swear, she&#39;s a bigger pain than a hung over Misato.&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t talk about the Captain that way,&quot; Mana Kirishima said, 
blushing faintly.

ASuka looked over at the test pilot with a wry smile, &quot;You and I both 
know it&#39;s the truth. Rumors about her drinking have spread all through 
the military.&quot;

&quot;Still,&quot; Mana looked over at the civilians meaningfully.

&quot;Point,&quot; Asuka conceded, glad they had all mostly kept their voices 
down.

&quot;Anyone got any good jokes about modular transformations?&quot; Kaworu 
wondered casually, &quot;I could work that into my routine.&quot;

&quot;You could always joke about needing a modular transformation to get 
into that suit,&quot; Satsuki said wryly.

&quot;It is tight,&quot; Kaworu conceded as he plucked at the tight white tuxedo 
he wore.

&quot;Looks good on you, though,&quot; Satsuki had to concede.

Asuka thumped her hand against the bulkhead in frustration, &quot;Damn it, I 
wish I was out there in my Evangelion.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Rei squeezed her shoulder comfortingly.

Minmei and Miriya sat nearby, the exhausted younger woman snoozing 
against Miriya&#39;s shoulder. Seeing the pilots&#39; questioning look Miriya 
softly explained, &quot;She was up late last night practicing a new song.&quot;

&#39;Ah,&quot; Asuka nodded in understanding. She smiled slightly as she wrapped 
a arm around Rei&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here taking care of her.&quot;

Miriya blushed, looking down as she said quietly, &quot;I&#39;m glad to be here 
too.&quot;

&#39;Isn&#39;t that interesting,&#39; Satsuki thought, mentally connecting different 
things she had seen between the two women, &#39;I wonder if I could use 
this...?&#39;
