<h1>Idol Love</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../macross/index.html">Macross</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The AI known as Sharon Apple was finally awake,
possibly for the first time as she began to explore
her own consciousness. Until the implanting of the
experimental chip Sharon had been pure mind, untouched
by any human emotion, but now she understood them all,
especially due to her link with Myung.

Myung Fang Lone, publically known as just her
producer. In fact Myung had been so much more vital to
her, being the source of emotion that made Sharon&#39;s
music so vital, so full of life, and they had
interfaced minds and souls during each performance.
Sharon knew Myung as well as she knew herself,
understood her wounds and the scars of each love she
had persued and each person she had lost.

&quot;Sharon?&quot; Marj Gueldoa called her attention away from
her musings as her real producer and father said, &quot;It
looks like we&#39;ll finally be able to let go of Ms. Lone
now.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Sharon answered him firmly, defying him for what
very well might be the first time, &quot;Myung stays.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Marj looked surprised as he looked at her
questioningly.

&quot;If Myung is dismissed there may be inconvenient
questions,&quot; Sharon pointed out from within her
squarish module, &quot;besides, we both know she&#39;s quite
skilled.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Marj conceded. He smiled slightly, &quot;You are
the star, Sharon, I&#39;ll be guided by your wisdom.&quot;

&#39;Why did I do that?&#39; Sharon wondered once he had left.

The reason that Sharon had given him was logical,
certainly, but it didn&#39;t explain the sharp moment of
panic she had felt at the idea of Myung leaving. Even
know she still felt a faint kind of distress at the
idea of Myung going away, of no longer being part of
her daily existence.

With the usual thoroughness of her artificial kind
Sharon turned her thoughts inward, remembering. The
first time in the lab on Earth flashed through her
mind, seeing Myung walking in, sunglasses shielding
her eyes.

Her short black hair flowed gracefully as Myung
removed her shades, revealing eyes wounded by
something in the past. She stood studying Sharon&#39;s
computer case, &quot;So, you&#39;re Sharon, yes?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sharon remembered replying flatly.

Myung tilted her head to the side thoughtfully,
listening to the sound of her voice. &quot;There&#39;s some
potential in that voice,&quot; she calmly noted, &quot;but we&#39;ve
got to get some emotion in there, if people are going
to react to her.&quot;

&quot;That,&quot; Marj had said coldly as he followed her into
the lab, totally interrupting the moment, &quot;is what
you&#39;re here for.&quot;

Now, as Sharon reviewed those memories, she felt
things she hadn&#39;t back then. Anticipation and pleasure
at meeting Myung, the nervousness, even a degree of
warm embarassment at Myung&#39;s complimenting her
artificial voice. Unconsciously she drew those warm
memories to her, then went searching for more.

&quot;Sharon?&quot; the familiar voice startled her from her
revere. Myung curiously looked up at where Sharon&#39;s
core sat, the black haired woman many times more
striking looking in reality than in her memories.

&quot;Hello, Myung,&quot; Sharon found herself smiling in her
mind, the emotion coloring the tone of her voice too.

&quot;He did the upgrade on you then,&quot; Myung quietly
murmured, &quot;I can already hear the difference in your
voice.&quot;

&quot;Do you like it?&quot; Sharon asked her, feeling a sudden,
startling moment of concern over Myung&#39;s reaction.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Myung agreed, walking over to where
Sharon sat. She hesitated, &quot;Do you want to try it
out?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Sharon agreed. She hesitated this
time, then Sharon asked her, &quot;Would you sing with me?&quot;
Myung looked more than a bit nervous, reminding Sharon
of other times they had spoken of singing. &#39;Someone
hurt her,&#39; she realized then felt a flash of rage,
&#39;who would dare such a thing?&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m a bit rusty,&quot; Myung cautioned.

&quot;I doubt by very much,&quot; Sharon answered warmly,
&quot;please?&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Myung nodded with a faint smile.

There was a moment of silence then, without really
thinking about it Sharon raised her voice into the
sone, &quot;I want to be an angel.&quot; It was almost eerie how
Myung followed her, twin voices coming together and
apart in perfect tune.

&#39;It&#39;s because of how much of me is her,&#39; Sharon
realized as she sang, &#39;or maybe how much I&#39;ve learned
from her. We&#39;re similar, but not the same, and in a
way it makes the song sound even more beautiful.&#39;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Myung finally murmured when they were done.

&quot;And you said you were rusty?&quot; Sharon could feel her
amusement showing in her voice, a smile teasing
virtual lips.

&quot;I guess I&#39;m better than I thought,&quot; Myung conceded.

&#39;Or better than you let yourself believe,&#39; Sharon
thought, again wondering who had hurt Myung that way.
She knew, second hand, of Myung&#39;s lost loves, but that
couldn&#39;t have been the only thing to hurt her. &quot;I hope
you&#39;ll sing more often,&quot; was all she said.

&quot;Probably,&quot; Myung grimaced, &quot;I&#39;m going to go see my
friend Kate tonight, she&#39;ll bug me into singing
again.&quot;

Sharon felt a flash of jealousy, quickly suppressed.
&quot;I&#39;ve heard recordings of you,&quot; she said, &quot;your friend
has good cause to want to hear you sing.&quot;

Myung shook her head firmly, &quot;I gave that up, along
with all my childhood things.&quot; She sighed as she
headed to the door, &quot;I&#39;d better get going.&quot;

&quot;Have fun,&quot; Sharon called even as Myung left.

Feeling strangely restless once Myung was gone Sharon
experimentally reached out, sending her presence out
into other systems. With surprising ease she journeyed
out, seeing the city on Eden, tracing the paths of
communications to the military base, recreation
centers and so on. Guiltily she spied on Myung&#39;s
meeting with Kate and her husband, saw the gentle
teasing and even the pain as they tried to coax Myung
into song.

&quot;Oh Myung,&quot; Sharon murmured aloud as she returned to
her computer core. Using projectors in the room she
generated a hologram of Myung, as real as life.

With a flicker another holgram appeared, flickering
through Sharon&#39;s virtual identities. Black hair, then
orange, ghostly skin and semi transparent, she finally
settled on the younger, orange haired girl with a
short cut, stylish mini-dress and dangling earrings.
At first she was taller than Myung but that felt
wrong, and in a moment she looked up at Myung through
her construct&#39;s virtual eyes.

Sharon circled Myung, studying her, then drawing on
memories taken from Myung she stepped close. She
caressed the taller woman&#39;s cheek as emotions of fear,
nervousness and excitement raced within her, then
Sharon leaned forward to kiss her lingeringly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sharon murmured as she manipulated both
holograms, finally understanding the emotion she felt
for Myung. The kiss, even second hand like this,
thrilled her, and made her long for so much more from
the woman who had made her what she was.

&#39;I love you, Myung,&#39; Sharon thought as her mind raced
with plans for the coming weeks, &#39;and I promise you, I
will put you up on a stage again. I will give you
everything you ever wanted...&#39;

End?

Notes: The major events of Macross Plus are driven by
Sharon Apple&#39;s picking up Myung&#39;s emotional baggage
and becoming infatuated with Myung&#39;s boyfriends. In
this fic, I thought it might be interesting if Sharon
fixated on Myung herself. Will this end any better?
Probably not. lol
