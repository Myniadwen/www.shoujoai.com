throwing her arms around the pilot happily as the
Little White Dragon restaurant roared to a stop. In
moments all his relations were gathered around him,
chattering happily as the tall young man tried to calm
them down.

&quot;Well isn&#39;t this interesting,&quot; Aida pushed his glasses
up, blonde hair still slightly messy from their recent
efforts defending the ship.

Hikaru nodded, her brown hair tied back as usual. &quot;We
knew he had family aboard, that&#39;s what he told us he
transferred aboard this madhouse for,&quot; she said
tersely.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Minmei&#39;s Aunt said after a few moments to
Aida, &quot;it&#39;s just been so long since we&#39;ve seen our
son.&quot; She gave them a searching look, &quot;You two are his
wingmen, now?&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Aida nodded.

&quot;Then you eat free tonight,&quot; she smiled as she waved
them over to a table where Lynn and Minmei were
chattering eagerly.

&quot;That&#39;s not necessary...&quot; Hikaru started.

&quot;Just keep him safe,&quot; Kyle&#39;s mother added softly.

At the table Minmei was smiling at him, but her
expression was deeply confused. &quot;The last time I saw
you, you were a pacifist,&quot; she blinked, &quot;how did you
become a pilot?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that complicated,&quot; Kyle admitted. He looked
off in the distance, &quot;When I thought my parents and
you had died with Macross city I was stunned... and
began to reexamine my life.&quot;

&quot;I find it hard to believe he was a peacenik,&quot; Aida
whispered to Hikaru.

&quot;Shhh!&quot; Hikaru hushed him softly.

Kyle smiled wryly, &quot;The quest for inner peace and
tranquillity kind of looks silly when a alien invasion
is coming. After a LOT of internal debate I enlisted,
intending to be a medic or something, but I quickly
discovered I liked the military life and became a
pilot.&quot;

&quot;Either way I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here,&quot; Minmei sighed
happily.

Suddenly a slew of heavily loaded plates were set
down, much larger than the normal portions the already
generous restaurant served. &quot;Eat up,&quot; the older woman
smiled cheerfully, &quot;there&#39;s seconds if you want them!&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Hikaru murmured, &quot;we&#39;re coming in here with
Kyle all the time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Aida agreed as they dug in.

Miriya watched from a safe distance, feeling that odd
sort of confusion once again. The green haired young
woman had been studying these micronians as covertly
as possible, trying to understand them, but more often
than not she was just confused.

Suddenly Minmei waved her over, &quot;Miriya!&quot;

Cursing her hesitation Miriya strode over, her clothes
as clean and well starched as any military uniform. &quot;I
didn&#39;t want to interrupt,&quot; she told her friend calmly.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Minmei smiled, &quot;Kyle, I&#39;d like you
to meet Miriya.&quot;

Kyle rose, taking her hand and shaking it politely, a
faintly thoughtful look in his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m honored,&quot; he
smiled charmingly.

Miriya felt a blush on her cheeks, but she couldn&#39;t
quite explain why. &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; she said,
trying to get her hand free.

Up in the part of the ship that was commonly referred
to as &#39;Officer&#39;s country&#39; two figures lay on the bed,
snuggling close to one another. &quot;We&#39;re going to have
to get up soon,&quot; Maya murmured, looking up at her
lover&#39;s face fondly.

&quot;We&#39;re not on shift for a few hours,&quot; Ritsuko sighed
as she gently tightened her arms around Maya, &quot;and
thankfully the rehearsals for the pageant don&#39;t begin
till tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Gah,&quot; Maya made a soft sound and Ritsuko chuckled
softly.

&quot;Have you decided to wear a dress or your uniform?&quot;
Ritsuko asked softly, stroking Maya&#39;s shoulder softly.

&quot;Uniform,&quot; Maya said firmly, &quot;I&#39;m not the dress type.&quot;

Ritsuko grinned, &quot;I can&#39;t wait until the swimsuit
competition.&quot;

&quot;Pervert,&quot; Maya groaned.

&quot;I&#39;m certainly a dirty old lady where you&#39;re
concerned,&quot; Ritsuko agreed, seemingly unbothered by
the idea.

&quot;You&#39;re not old to me,&quot; and Maya kissed her gently.
They cuddled close for a few moments, &quot;What do you
think of the Captain&#39;s idea?&quot;

&quot;Marrying us in the pageant?&quot; Ritsuko sighed. She
looked up at the roof, eyes troubled, &quot;I wonder if
Misato has thought through all the angles?&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Maya smiled with amusement, &quot;it&#39;s good for
morale, it&#39;ll balance out the announcement we&#39;re
leaving Earth and it&#39;ll be a poke in the eye to
command, too.&quot;

&quot;They are still officially using a policy of &#39;Don&#39;t
ask, don&#39;t tell,&#39; aren&#39;t they?&quot; Ritsuko looked
honestly amused. &quot;But do you want to go through with
it?&quot; she pressed.

&quot;It&#39;s bigger than anything I expected us to do,&quot; Maya
admitted. She smiled slightly, &quot;But I couldn&#39;t be
prouder to let everyone on the crew know I love you.&quot;

Ritsuko kissed her suddenly, wrapping her arms around
Maya. &quot;Me, too.&quot;

After a few moment&#39;s they separated, curled up
together. &quot;Of course,&quot; Maya said breathlessly, &quot;I
guess this makes my coming out to my parents a bit
more urgent.&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t know?&quot; Ritsuko blinked.

&quot;I figure they have a good idea,&quot; Maya&#39;s eyes danced
with amusement, &quot;but no, I&#39;ve never actually told
them.&quot;

&quot;If you need any moral support,&quot; Ritsuko offered
gently.

&quot;Please,&quot; Maya laughed.

Down on the &#39;arms&#39; of the massive ship a casually
dressed Asuka Langley watched closely as a team of
technicians swarmed over her fighter, repairing
systems and swapping out damaged parts. She had taken
a bad hit in the last battle, losing several internal
systems and only by going to EVA mode had she been
able to recover.

&quot;It was a close one, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; the quiet voice said.

Asuka jerked in surprise as she recognized the back
haired woman who had come up on her so quietly. &quot;Yes,
ma&#39;am.&quot; Asuka saluted the captain crisply.

&quot;At ease,&quot; Misato waved it off, &quot;I know you&#39;re off
duty.&quot; She was in uniform, the blue and gold shining
as she watched the techs at work. &quot;I just came down to
take a look,&quot; she added softly.

Asuka relaxed a bit, but not too much. The Captain was
known to take occasional walks through the ship, one
assumed to keep herself familiar with what was going
on aboard the SDF-1, but this was the first time Asuka
had actually met her on one of those trips.

&quot;Your wing,&quot; Misato said softly, &quot;is doing remarkably
well. I assume you know, but I just wanted to say it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am,&quot; Asuka nodded.

&quot;I&#39;ve had some requests to break you up,&quot; Misato
added, &quot;put Shinji and Ayanami in command of their own
squads.&quot;

Asuka hesitated, &quot;That may not be such a good idea.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&#39; Misato looked curious.

&quot;They&#39;re both very good at what they do,&quot; Asuka
searched for the right words, &quot;but they don&#39;t seem to
be able to ease up enough for others to keep up with
&#39;em. I don&#39;t know what would happen if you put rookies
under their command, but I doubt it&#39;d be good.&quot;

&quot;Pretty much my thought,&quot; Misato agreed, &quot;don&#39;t worry,
we&#39;re keeping you together.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Asuka smiled in relief.</pre>
