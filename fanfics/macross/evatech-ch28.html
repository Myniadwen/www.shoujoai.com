<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 28 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../macross/index.html">Macross</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../macross/evatech-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>&quot;... and then what happened?&quot; Asuka Langley blinked,
the flame haired pilot quietly talking to the officer
who was in charge of the SDF-1&#39;s fully equipped brig.
It didn&#39;t really look like a prison, in part because
of the bright lighting and high tech design, but the
feel of the place was still oppressive.

The blonde haired young woman grinned back as Hitomi
cheerfully said, &quot;Well, apparently your friend Miriya
decided that Min-Mei had been insulted and took a
swing at Petty Officer MacKenzie. His buddies jumped
into it, then Min-Mei started clobbering people over
the head with chairs.&quot;

&quot;Oy,&quot; Asuka winced, easily imagining how that brawl
down at the Little White Dragon must have gone.

&quot;We&#39;re just lucky her cousin Lynn Kyle wasn&#39;t there,&quot;
Rei Ayanami noted thoughtfully as the red eyed girl
continued, &quot;or things could have been much, much
worse.&quot;

A very sheepish looking Miriya emerged from the back
first, then a chuckling Min-Mei, talking pleasantly to
the officer escorting them. &quot;Asuka,&quot; Min-Mei smiled
charmingly, &quot;fancy seeing you here.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lucky Shinji&#39;s out on patrol duty,&quot; Asuka said
wryly, &quot;or he&#39;d be here getting you out and demanding
a explaination.&quot;

Mirya bowed slightly as the green haired woman said to
the both quietly, &quot;Thank you for helping us, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Rei Ayanami noticed how pale Miriya was as the blue
haired woman asked her, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

A ghost of a smile flickered across her lips as Miriya
conceded, &quot;I don&#39;t handle captivity very well, it
seems.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Rei nodded.

Hitomi extended forms to them to fill out as she said
briskly, &quot;Petty Officer MacKenzie will be coming up on
charges over this incident, but the military police
are just letting you two off with a warning.&quot;

Min-mei frowned, &quot;But they started...&quot;

Asuka reached out to put a hand on her shoulder, &quot;The
captain wants to discourage fighting aboard ship in
the strongest way possible. With all of us bottled up
in here, things could get out of hand very, very
easily.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got a point,&quot; Miriya conceded.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Min-Mei frowned, clearly not agreeing with them
but also unwilling to continue to argue the issue.

&quot;Do you want to go home, or should I accompany you to
rehersals for the pageant?&quot; Miriya asked respectfully.

Min-Mei winced visibly. &quot;What I&#39;d really like to do is
go home and sleep,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but the show must
go on.&quot;

&quot;Miss Min-Mei?&quot; Hitomi asked as the group got ready to
go.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Min-Mei turned to ask.

Hitomi produced a piece of paper as she asked, &quot;Could
I have the autograph of a future Miss Macross winner?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t won yet,&quot; Min-Mei blushed as she signed.

&quot;You will,&quot; Hitomi nodded firmly, &quot;you outshine them
all.&quot;

The group of four left the security wing of the mighty
fortress ship, Asuka leading the way while Rei took up
the rear. &quot;I think she likes you,&quot; Asuka teased as
they passed a digital screen showing the view outside,
the planet Earth receeding slowly as they put distance
between the SDF-1 and it.

&quot;Asuka,&quot; Min-Mei blushed, pausing a moment to take in
the view too.

Exiled from Earth by government order the massive
vessel had left home peacefully, but they were always
shadowed by the massive Zentradi fleet. Day after day
they launched probing assaults against the ship, and
each time they fought the enemy back. But all the crew
were aware that the Zentradi had a overwhelming force
available if they truly wished to use it, and grimly
waited for the other shoe to drop.

&#39;Which is why we&#39;re so caught up in the pageant,&#39; Rei
silently mused as they reached a transit route into
the city itself, &#39;it provides a distraction from all
that.&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m not surprised you&#39;re popular,&quot; Asuka noted
cheerfully, &quot;you certainly have the looks and charm.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re settled down with Rei,&quot; Min-Mei noted
with some amusement, &quot;or I&#39;d be worried you were
trying to charm me into something.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m shocked you even think that,&quot; Asuka joked.

Seeing the slightly pinched look on Miriya&#39;s face Rei
murmured to her, &quot;You don&#39;t need to be so worried.
They&#39;re just old friends.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Miriya managed a smile, &quot;I&#39;m just not used to
things like this.&quot;

Meanwhile, up on the bridge Captain Misato furtively
snuck a sip from her can of beer. &quot;Do you have to do
that?&quot; Aoba asked wearily.

&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; Misato answered as she put her can of
beer down beside her chair. The black haired woman
adjusted her officer&#39;s cap as she briskly asked,
&quot;Maya, patrol status?&quot;

Maya Ibuki touched her control console, the brown
haired younger woman oddly dressed in a tuxedo. &quot;Ikari
reports a skirmish in sector I-1,&quot; she said briskly,
&quot;he believes it to be merely a probing attempt.&quot;

Ritsuko frowned as she studied combat data then the
dyed blonde noted, &quot;But they&#39;ve been probing more
frequently lately...&quot;

&quot;Do you think they&#39;re planing something?&quot; Misato
wondered, her eyes narrowing.

&quot;They have to do something,&quot; Maya offered, &quot;if their
high command is anywhere near as impatient as ours
is.&quot;

Everyone on the bridge chuckled at that. Misato&#39;s
fights with Earth high command were becoming
legendary, from her fight to offload civilians to
their recent forced launch from Earth before ship and
crew were ready. To say Misato was becoming a thorn in
Earth Command&#39;s side was a understatement, but there
was little their superiors could do about it.

&quot;Any changes in their force deployments?&quot; Misato
wondered.

Ritsuko shook her head, &quot;Not that we can see. But
there&#39;s such a high density of screening ships at the
core of their fleet we can&#39;t say for sure what&#39;s
happening there.&quot;

&quot;Would deploying a radar wing help?&quot; Maya wondered.

A radar wing was a modified craft carrying a powerful
sensor rig, named after the older radar planes. It
could be more powerful than ship sensors in that it
could probe with greater focus in a particular
direction, but such craft were also very vulnerable.

&quot;No,&quot; Misato shook her head firmly, &quot;they&#39;ve been able
to capture one previously. I&#39;m not risking it
happening again.&quot;

&quot;We could ask Skull Squadron to attempt a reconnasance
mission,&quot; Ritsuko offered.

&quot;The Angels of Death?&quot; Misato smiled faintly, &quot;Knowing
them, they&#39;d volunteer. But it&#39;d be a massive blow to
our morale if we lost them.&quot;

&quot;I doubt we&#39;d lose them,&quot; Maya said after a moment,
&quot;but you&#39;re probably right.&quot;

Out in the depths of space a squadron of fighters
swept through the night, their metal shining in the
starlight. Shinji Ikari lead them in his blue trimmed
Valkyrie, the brown haired man&#39;s eyes intent as he
studied the darkness.

&quot;Sir, we&#39;ve cleared the sector,&quot; Lynn Kyle said
quietly.

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Shinji frowned slightly, wondering what
exactly was bothering him. The sensor data showed
clear, as did ship based scans but...

&quot;Do you want to do another fly-by?&quot; Aida asked a bit
tiredly.

&quot;Sorry folks,&quot; Shinji apologized, &quot;but something&#39;s
bugging me. Another pass. Please.&quot;

Firing low powered thrusters the fighters shifted
course, retracing their steps as the ominous shapes of
Zentradi ships followed at a distance. As they cruised
along the pilots searched the darkness, then Hikari
spoke up, &quot;You&#39;re right, there IS something.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Kyle wondered.

&quot;There are black shapes...,&quot; Hikari said seriously as
the brown haired woman peered out her view screen,
&quot;you can see them when they blot out the stars.&quot;

&quot;Oh crap,&quot; Aida breathed out in alarm.

&#39;We&#39;re using tight band transmissions between
fighters,&#39; Shinji&#39;s mind raced, &#39;they probably don&#39;t
know we&#39;ve spotted them. Do I radio the SDF-1 or...&#39;

THOOM! Suddenly the concealed ships were wracked by
missile fire as a single fighter swept in, weapons
blazing. &quot;Let&#39;s do this,&quot; Hikari cried, leading Aida
in a rapid assault.

&#39;Jumped the gun.&#39; Shinji thought grimly as he
activated the radio and contacted the SDF-1, &quot;This is
recon flight one, there are cloaked battlepods
inbound! I repeat, cloaked battlepods!&quot; Shutting down
the connection Shinji kicked in the afterburners and
raced to the fight, the battlepods revealing
themselves as they fired back.

&quot;Cloaked battlepods?&quot; Misato sat up on the bridge, her
eyes widening in surprise.

Ritsuko raced to the sensors console and began to
manipulate scan frequencies as she muttered, &quot;We
should have anticipated this...&quot;

Maya hit the general alarm as she ordered, &quot;All
reserve pilots, to your fighters! This is not a drill,
I repeat, this is not a drill!&quot;

&quot;Keep an eye on the main fleet,&quot; Misato ordered, &quot;and
prepare to transform the SDF-1!&quot; She sat back as she
thought, &#39;This could be it...&#39;
