<h2>a <a href="../melancholy/index.html">The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Calmly Yuki Nagato turned the page of her book, the almost purple-grey 
haired young woman&#39;s glasses gleaming in the sunlight as she read. &quot;So,&quot; 
she said in her usual calm manner, not looking up from the pages, &quot;why 
did you tell me that you&#39;re a time traveler?&quot;

&quot;I... well...&quot; Mikuru Asahina blushed, the light reddish-brown haired 
girl sitting at the table nearby in the SOS club headquarters, dressed 
up in her maid&#39;s outfit. Not that she wanted to be a maid, but Haruhi 
Suzumiya had insisted she should wear it, and what Haruhi wanted she 
usually got.

Take this classroom for instance. Formerly belonging to the book club 
Haruhi had taken it over by sheer force of her will, much as she did 
everything in her life. Her new &quot;SOS&quot; club grew based on her abducting 
certain classmates, she even got them a computer via force of pure 
self-confidence. It was all quite impressive to see, if a bit scary.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Yuki asked, her school uniform as neat as always.

&quot;I was hoping we could help each other out,&quot; Mikuru shyly confessed.

Yuki actually looked up from her book at her, the young woman sitting in 
a folding chair beside the window so that the sunlight would illuminate 
her book. &quot;How so?&quot; she asked Mikuru in a flat tone of voice.

&quot;Because I&#39;m a traveler, I know what you are too...&quot; Mikuru said 
timidly.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Light glinted off Yuki&#39;s glasses as she closed her book, gently 
setting it on the ledge by the window.

Mikuru gulped nervously as she revealed, &quot;A Data Life form, a human 
purpose interface sent to observe Suzumiya-san.&quot;

&quot;Correct,&quot; Yuki nodded, clearly unbothered by the fact that Mikuru knew 
about her. Her head tilted to the side, &quot;How can you help me, exactly?&quot;

&quot;You... well,&quot; Mikuru hesitated.

&quot;Continue,&quot; Yuki prompted her.

&quot;You don&#39;t really act very human,&quot; Mikuru burst out.

&quot;And that&#39;s a problem?&quot; Yuki asked her, only looking mildly curious.

&quot;Even Suzumiya-san will notice something is going on,&quot; Mikuru said to 
her urgently, &quot;unless we try to conceal your alien-ness.&quot;

Calmly Yuki asked her, &quot;And how often have you nearly blurted out that 
you&#39;re a time traveler?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Mikuru blushed.

In fact Mikuru had very nearly blurted out pieces of important 
information several times, in addition to revealing her secret identity 
to Kyon. There was something about the dour brown haired boy that 
inspired trust, and his steady efforts to keep Haruhi from causing too 
much trouble were appreciated by all. Even worse, Mikuru had starred in 
a home made film directed by Haruhi, featuring her as a time travelling 
combat waitress, of all things. It was going to take her YEARS to live 
that down.

&#145;At least as a time traveler I have time,&#39; Mikuru sighed.

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Yuki said after a moment&#39;s consideration of her orders and 
responsibilities, &quot;we can help each other.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Mikuru asked.

&quot;You obviously need some assistance in keeping it a secret that you are 
a time traveler,&quot; Yuki said to her calmly, &quot;and you are correct that 
it&#39;s possible Haruhi might deduce my alien nature due to my behavior.&quot;

&quot;So...?&quot; Mikuru leaned forward.

&quot;I will assist you in return for your help,&quot; Yuki agreed.

Mikuru gave a relieved sigh, slumping back in her seat as she said, &quot;I&#39;m 
so glad!&quot;

&quot;Kyon,&quot; Yuki said after a moment.

&quot;We&#39;re just friends,&quot; the formerly relaxed Mikuru blurted out, sitting 
up in her seat and blushing brightly.

Yuki actually looked amused at that reaction as she said, &quot;I was 
wondering if we should get him involved, too.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; the still fiercely blushing Mikuru said, &quot;no, I don&#39;t think so. 
He&#39;s too close to Haruhi, in a way.&quot;

&quot;Is this a time traveler&#39;s prediction, then?&quot; Yuki asked calmly, giving 
Mikuru a long, considering look..

&quot;Oh, no, I&#39;m not allowed to,&quot; Mikuru shook her head before muttering, 
&quot;bad enough my future self appeared to give Kyon a hint.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Yuki looked curious.

&quot;Nothing, nothing,&quot; Mikuru said quickly.

&quot;So,&quot; Yuki got up from her chair and reached up to adjust her glasses, 
&quot;appearing human. How will this work?&quot;

Mikuru got up from her own chair as she said, &quot;Well, take lunch for 
instance. You always eat in here alone?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t eat lunch,&quot; Yuki said flatly in reply, &quot;as a data entity I have 
no need for physical nourishment.&quot;

&quot;But other students do,&quot; Mikuru said earnestly, &quot;and having lunch with 
other students is part of being in school.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Yuki looked calmly blank.

&quot;Really,&quot; Mikuru sighed, realizing this was going to be tougher than she 
thought.

Notes: This is a first draft, more or less, and will have more added to 
once I figure out which way to go with it. lol The series &quot;The 
Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot; is very cool, but the characters are 
giving me fits trying to write. So I&#39;m posting this, then will go back 
to it later with more material.</pre>
