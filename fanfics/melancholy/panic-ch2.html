<h1>Haruhi Panic! (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../melancholy/index.html">The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../melancholy/panic-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Ryouko Asakura paused just outside the SOS Brigade&#39;s club room, 
listening in on the conversation through the old, thin walls. &#39;It&#39;s not 
really eavesdropping,&#39; the slim, blue haired girl thought to herself 
mildly in justification, &#39;I&#39;m just waiting out here for Yuki. It&#39;s not 
my fault I can hear every word.&#39;

&quot;So how do we change it back?&quot; she heard Kyonko ask the others in the 
room and felt herself tense a bit.

&quot;It might be best to let the scenario play out,&quot; Koizumi answered her in 
his usual mild tone of voice as he added, &quot;and see what happens.&quot;

Ryouko relaxed a bit, listening to them intently. &quot;In other words,&quot; 
Kyonko said with a weary sounding sigh, &quot;we&#39;re stuck like this for 
awhile?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so,&quot; Koizumi agreed, sounding rather pleased by the idea, 
really.

&quot;Oh great,&quot; Kyonko whimpered.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; MIkuru said, her voice gentle and sweet, &quot;we&#39;ll do our 
best to help you adapt, Kyon!&quot;

&#39;If you think it&#39;s strange for all of you,&#39; Ryouko thought to herself 
bitterly as she leaned up against the hallway wall, &#39;imagine what it 
might be like to be deleted first.&#39; Before this morning she had been 
non-existant, wiped out from reality by Yuki&#39;s superior data 
manipulation abilities. But somehow in Haruhi&#39;s latest rebooting of the 
world she had been recreated once more, and hilariously cast as Yuki&#39;s 
lover.

Almost as if she knew that Ryouko was thinking about her Haruhi Suzumiya 
strode up the hallway, her short brown hair held back by a golden 
hairband and dressed in the usual school uniform. . &quot;Asakura,&quot; Haruhi 
nodded a greeting as she asked her, &quot;are you waiting for Yuki?&quot;

&quot;Yes, President,&quot; Ryouko replied, smiling slightly. While she needed to 
treat Haruhi with a certain degree of caution, she couldn&#39;t resist 
teasing her just a bit. &#39;Besides,&#39; she hid a smile as she thought, &#39;any 
reactions I do get might be useful in our research.&#39;

&quot;Don&#39;t start with that, class President,&quot; Haruhi shot back with a smile. 
She reached for the door then hesitated as she quietly asked, 
&quot;Ryouko...?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ryouko looked at her curiously.

Haruhi met her eyes with a slight blush coloring her cheeks. &quot;Yuki is my 
friend,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;I hope you&#39;re taking good care of her.&quot;

Ryouko felt a minor burst of surprise, beginning deep within her and 
spreading outward. &#39;Haruhi is worried about Yuki?&#39; she thought, stunned, 
&#39;But I thought Haruhi didn&#39;t care about it....&#39; Noting Haruhi&#39;s confused 
look Ryouko realized she was taking too long to answer, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, you 
surprised me.&quot; Clearing her throat she added, &quot;I care for Yuki very 
much.&quot;

Haruhi gave a relieved smile, &quot;Good!&quot; She opened the door as she 
addressed Ryouko over her shoulder, &quot;I&#39;ll let Yuki know you&#39;re waiting.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ryouko bowed slightly.

Haruhi paused as she was about to go in, &quot;Ryouko, have you ever 
considered joining the SOS Brigade?&quot;

Ryouko smiled back sweetly as she lied, &quot;I thought it might be better if 
Yuki had a place to go to without her girlfriend, occasionally.&quot;

Haruhi nodded as she headed the rest of the way in, &quot;Fair enough.&quot;

Ryouko listened intently to Haruhi&#39;s entrance and her enthusiastic kiss 
to a mildly reluctant Kyonko. &#39;Poor girl,&#39; Ryouko smiled wryly, &#39;I 
wonder if she remembers the old world or not?&#39; By the sound of her 
confused objections Ryouko guessed the original Kyon was still in there.

Mikuru also objected to Haruhi&#39;s public lewdness and eventually the 
brigade leader settled down. Haruhi called the meeting to order and they 
had a slightly shorter than usual meeting in which Haruhi urged the 
others to look harder for the mysteriously elusive Aliens, Espers, 
Sliders and Time travellers.

&#39;Open your eyes,&#39; Ryouko urged mentally, &#39;they&#39;re right there in front 
of you.&#39;

&quot;All right,&quot; Haruhi loudly declared, &quot;the meeting is dismissed!&quot; Then 
Ryouko had to fight back a laugh as she heard Haruhi purr, &quot;Kyonko!&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Kyonko answered warily.

&quot;You didn&#39;t forget about our date this afternoon?&quot; Haruhi asked

&quot;Date?&quot; Kyonko yelped then Ryouko heard her clearing her throat. &quot;Of 
course not,&quot; the young woman replied nervously, &quot;what time did you want 
to meet?&quot;

&quot;Around six,&quot; Haruhi said cheerfully, &quot;we can go out for a snack then... 
you can take me home.&quot;

Before Ryouko could hear any more of that interesting conversation Yuki 
opened the club&#39;s door, the light blue haired girl looking at her 
calmly. &quot;Ryouko,&quot; Yuki said expressionlessly, &quot;thank you for waiting for 
me.&quot;

Ryouko stepped up to fold Yuki into her arms, once again surprised at 
how right it felt, holding her. &quot;I missed you, Yuki,&quot; she purred, 
sliding a hand along her cheek.

Yuki met her eyes, unnamed emotions swirling in them as she whispered, 
&quot;And I, you.&quot;

Tilting Yuki&#39;s face up a bit Ryouko kissed her lingeringly, pressing 
their lips together as she wrapped her arms around the smaller girl. 
&quot;Oh,&quot; Ryouko sighed as she finally broke off the kiss, &quot;I needed that.&quot;

Kyonko was blushing furiously, looking away in that awkward way that 
showed he&#39;d been watching avidly while they were kissing. Haruhi had a 
rather thoughtful look that spelled a interesting night for Kyonko, 
while Mikuru looked like she might faint from blood rushing to her 
brain. Only Koizumi looked like he might not be buying their passion, 
and Ryouko firmly reminded herself not to underestimate him.

&#39;Those esper boys always seem to know more than what&#39;s good for them,&#39; 
Ryouko thought as she gently guided Yuki off down thre hall, holding 
hands.

&quot;Was that really necessary?&quot; Yuki asked softly, her lips barely moving 
as they made their way from the old building and through the school.

&quot;Of course it was,&quot; Ryouko answered honestly as they went outside into 
the sun, &quot;Haruhi has to believe we&#39;re involved with each other.&quot; She 
linked her arm with Yuki&#39;s and walked close to her, savoring the other 
girl&#39;s sweet scent.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Yuki replied, not quite agreeing with Ryouko, but importantly not 
disagreeing either.

Ryouko smiled as they walked together, one couple amid a crowd of 
cheerful romantic girls, many of whom were also coupled together. &quot;Did 
you receive a response from the Data Entity?&quot; she asked curiously.

Yuki nodded shortly as she reported, &quot;The Data Entity is impressed by 
Haruhi&#39;s manipulation of both subtle and gross aspects of this new 
reality.&quot; They followed the crowds down the hill, eventually peeling off 
at the park and heading towards their apartment building.

&quot;THe subtle being the memory changes,&quot; Ryouko guessed accurately as she 
mused, &quot;and the gross being the gender switch and other reality edits.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Yuki agreed. &quot;I preformed a new internet search on the 
school, all the sites I accessed showed it has a long history as a 
girl&#39;s school.&quot;

As they used their password to get into the building Yuki noted the odd 
sensation of having twin tracks of memories. On one hand she recalled 
her original life where she had lived here all alone, but now she also 
had equally valid memories of cohabiting for several months with Ryouko 
in what could almost be described as wedded bliss.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Ryouko asked her gently as she watched Yuki 
hesitate in unlocking the front door.

Yuki nodded slightly as she turned the knob open, &quot;Just preparing 
myself.&quot;

The formally empty style of decorating Yuki had favored was no longer 
present, instead the apartment now had a much more feminine touch. 
Decorative items like plants and sculptures were littered about, screens 
separated sections of the room and there was more furniture than Yuki&#39;s 
low table and two pillows.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Ryouko looked around avidly, &quot;it looks just like I remembered.&quot; 
Her lips twisted in a wry smile as she added, &quot;Despite the fact that 
this is the very first time I&#39;ve seen it.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Yuki nodded, feeling oddly comforted knowing Ryouko was also 
having issues with memory.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Ryouko took Yuki&#39;s hand and pulled her through the suite as 
she said cheerfully, &quot;I want to see our bedroom!&quot;

The bedroom was as changed as the rest of the apartment. The plain, 
inexpensive futon Yuki used to occasionally lay down on was gone, 
replaced by a plush, fancy semi-double bed that might be used for 
newlyweds. In addition to the larger bed there were fancy pillows and 
blankets, as well as a small wooden case beside the bed.

A blush stole across Yuki&#39;s face as memories relating to the box 
cascaded through her mind. &quot;Is that...?&quot; she couldn&#39;t quite complete the 
thought.

Ryouko flipped the top open and peered inside. &quot;Yes,&quot; she noted in a 
normal, conversational tone of voice, &quot;it appears we have a extensive 
collection of sex toys.&quot;

Yuki looked in too as she murmured partially to herself, &quot;What sort of 
things has Haruhi been reading?&quot;

Ryouko frowned thoughtfully as she mused, &quot;Well, we do know she spends a 
fair bit of time looking on the internet every day... it&#39;s quite 
possible she picked it up from there.&quot; She began to catalog the items 
softly, &quot;Butt plug, dildo and harness, massage oil, nipple clamps....&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; the faintly blushing Yuki said, wrestling with some very explicit 
Haruhi created memories of using those devices on Ryouko, not to mention 
Ryouko using a few on her.

Ryouko looked up at Yuki thoughtfully, &quot;You know, we have no idea when 
reality will revert....&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Yuki kept any nervousness out of her voice.

&quot;I&#39;m sure the integrated Data Thought Entity might be interested in the 
new experiences we could produce with these,&quot; Ryouko smiled slightly 
wickedly, &quot;first hand, so to speak.&quot;

&quot;I...,&quot; Yuki hesitated, knowing that Ryouko did have a valid point. &quot;All 
right,&quot; she conceded then added firmly, &quot;but I&#39;m in charge first.&quot;

Ryouko smiled, &quot;Whatever you say, mistress.&quot;</pre>
