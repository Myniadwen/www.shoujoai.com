<h1>Unexpected Changes (part 1 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dbz/index.html">Dragonball Z</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yurifan.html">Yuri Fan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Tom looked up from his printer. Sure enough, more pages continued to 
spew out. He had more Fan Fiction to read. Tom loved all kinds of Fan 
Fiction. He could read it for hours. But one day changed his life 
forever.

Tom was printing a DBZ Fan Fiction on the story of one of his favorite 
characters, Bra. He knew that Bra was not real, and that he would 
never be able to be with her. But inside he loved Bra, and wished to 
be in DBZ land every day. He knew it was silly, but his philosophy was 
&quot;A guy can dream, can&#39;t he?&quot;

The story was about Bra going to high school. He was starting to read 
something about Pan but suddenly Tom began to feel too tired to read. 
Tom always liked to read the entire Fan Fiction story without putting 
it down, but something in this story was different. As he read, he had 
a very funny feeling deep inside. He started to get a headache and 
decided to lie down on his couch, because even though it was 4:30 PM 
he was suddenly very tired. He drifted off to sleep the printed story 
on his chest.

When Tom awoke he felt extremely strange. He felt as if his skin was 
all itchy. He looked up to... a blue ceiling. This was extremely odd. 
He rolled over and got another surprise: he was lying on a bed. 

&quot;Didn&#39;t I fall asleep on the couch?&quot; Tom said out loud, and then he 
screamed as loud as he could. His voice! It was not his! It was a 
woman&#39;s!

Then Tom practically had a heart attack. A man entered the room, a man 
who Tom had seen on TV many times, a man who in once sentence answered 
all of Tom&#39;s questions.

&quot;Bra, I heard you scream. Are you all right?&quot; Vegeta asked the 
trembling girl.

&quot;I...I...Uh...&quot; Tom, who was now Bra, could say nothing. How could 
this have happened? One minute he was asleep, but the next he was 
transported to the world of DBZ! 

&quot;Bra, can you hear me?&quot; Vegeta asked with concern. 

Bra passed out on the bed, unable to think anymore.

When Bra awoke she looked at Vegeta, Bra&#39;s father. 

&quot;This has to be a dream.&quot; Bra said in a loud yell. &quot;I can&#39;t be a girl! 
I can&#39;t!!&quot;

&quot;And why is that?&quot; said Vegeta with a smirk. &quot;You have been a girl all 
of you life. You must have just had a bad dream that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;How could fate be so unkind!?!&quot; thought Bra silently. &quot;I am 
transported to the world of Dragon Ball Z, but I am stuck in the body 
of the woman I love!&quot; Not only that, but just thinking about having to 
live his life as a woman made her shudder. Tom was no sexist, but he 
was straight, and having to do it with guys made him wanna puke. If 
this was real, this was terrible. What had Tom ever done to deserve 
this?

Vegeta slowly got to his feet. &quot;Well if you feel better I have to go. 
You know your mother and I have a date at 7:00 tonight. We&#39;ll be back 
before 11:30. Take it easy, Bra.&quot;

Bra just lay there, stunned. As Vegeta shut the door, Bra looked down 
at her body, and any last hopes of this all being a dream vanished 
from her mind. Her womanly figure stared back at her, being as 
beautiful as Tom always imagined it would be be. Nothing this 
beautiful could possibly be a dream. Before Bra could think about 
anything else, however, she heard a very strange noise coming from her 
closet. It sounded like a girl, coughing. 

&quot;BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR&quot; The loud noise of Bulma and Vegeta&#39;s 
car starting startled Bra, but not nearly as much as the noise that 
immediately followed it. The sliding door of Bra&#39;s closet slid open, 
and Pan crept out of it with a devilish grin on her pretty, slender 
round face.

&quot;Was that them? Is your father gone? He would kill me if he knew about 
us. I can&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t notice me in here. I though we were 
busted when he almost walked in on us this afternoon&quot;. Pan must have 
been very lonely being cooped up inside that closet for so long, for 
she said all of this very fast. Bra stared at the girl. From all he 
had read he had always assumed that Bra was much prettier than Pan. 
This may have been true in some ways, as Pan wasn&#39;t as perfectly 
feminine as Bra was. But there was more to beauty than looks alone. 
Much more, Bra soon discovered, as Pan lifted her shapely breasts into 
the air. She thrust her head back, arched her chest forward, and 
uttered a low moan.

&quot;Ooh it was sooo cramped in there.&quot; Pan said seductively. Pan gave a 
devilishly sexy grin and said &quot;But waiting for you was worth it.&quot; Bra 
stared at Pan&#39;s shapely figure, not realizing that her own body was 
starting to get warm. Besides the immediate business of being totally 
turned on, Bra couldn&#39;t help but think, &quot;I-I mean Bra, is a lesbian? 
How long has this been going on??&quot; Bra could not help but think maybe 
she was lucky that she didn&#39;t stay in her original Tom body when she 
got to DBZ Land.

&quot;Let me kiss you. You were so good to me last night. I have to make it 
up to you.&quot; Pan slowly moved her face towards Bra, and then kissed 
her. She started gently at first, but soon Bra felt as if the dark 
haired Pan had put her entire tongue down her throat. It was a better 
kiss than any of those her girlfriends had given her, back when she 
was Tom. Bra didn&#39;t know if Pan was just the words best kisser or if 
Bra&#39;s mouth was just better for kissing. Judging by the absolute 
amazing pleasure she was feeling, Bra decided that is was the first 
one. 

As the kiss wore on, Bra could barely breathe from her arousal and 
excitement. As Pan slowly stopped the kiss, Bra could barely speak.

&quot;You are the best kisser in the world, Pan.&quot; Bra managed to say with 
great effort.

&quot;You&#39;re not so bad yourself,&quot; Pan said as she started to move her body 
closer to Bra&#39;s.

Pan started taking off her clothes very slowly. Bra began to do the 
same. &quot;Why not?&quot; thought Bra with excitement. &quot;I have a wonderful 
girlfriend who likes me a lot. We have obviously had sex before, so 
what is wrong?&quot; At least that is what Bra tried to think. As Pan moved 
even closer to Bra&#39;s naked body, Bra could no longer have any thoughts 
as she was consumed by passion.

Bra reached her hands towards Pan&#39;s large breasts, but Pan pinned her 
lover down on the bed. As Bra struggled in futility against the other 
woman&#39;s strength, Pan became even more turned on. She lowed her chest 
down to Bra&#39;s and began to lick her neck. Bra moaned with anticipation 
as Pan began to kiss and lick lower and lower down her lover&#39;s tender, 
goose bumpy body. Pan dragged her tongue down Bra&#39;s firm breast, 
licking tiny circles on her left nipple. Bra began to breathe even 
quicker, and started to squeal and moan as her nipples hardened. 

Finally, after seeming like hours of wonderful teasing pleasure, Pan 
began to suck on Bra&#39;s left nipple like a child. Bra moaned loudly at 
this, feeling greater pleasure than she had ever felt before, in both 
lives. 

After a few minutes of this Pan finished the sucking with a gentle 
bite, earning a loud scream of pleasure from blue haired lover. Pan 
then began to move her tongue down Bra&#39;s stomach, and swirled around 
her inner thigh. 

Bra could not take the teasing anymore. It was so pleasurable...but 
she needed more.

&quot;Please, Pan...&quot; bra moaned in her pleasure

&quot;Please what, Bra?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Do you want this?&quot; Pan put her touch just a fraction of an inch above 
her waiting crotch, then pulled it back. &quot;Just say the word...&quot;

Bra had no idea what has next, but from what her former girlfriends 
had told her about sex back in her Tom life, she knew that the best 
part had not even begun.

&quot;I want you Pan...&quot; Said Bra with through quick gasps.

Pan wasted no time. She put her tongue into her waiting orchid and 
massaged Bra&#39;s womanhood, which was dripping with arousal and aching 
with desire. As Bra&#39;s clit came into view, Pan began to lick it 
smoothly.

Bra, having never been female before, had no idea what was going on 
but instinct took over. She started to move her hips back and forth 
with the rhythm of Pan&#39;s tongue movements while screaming in pure 
pleasure.

Bra then let out an extremely loud scream, and her whole body became 
stiff and she was filled with the pleasure of her orgasm. Pan licked 
up the fluid, and Bra&#39;s heavy breathing slowed down. Pan finally 
unpinned her sayin lover and lied down. Within two minutes Bra was 
almost asleep, lying naked on top of Pan. 

&quot;I have never been more happy in my entire life&quot; was the last thought 
Bra had before finally going to sleep.</pre>
