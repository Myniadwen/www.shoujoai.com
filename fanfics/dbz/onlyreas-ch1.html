<pre>~*On her way home*~

Pan sighed tiredly as she made her way towards her home at the Son 
Residence. She was now 19, and still didn&#39;t even have a boyfriend... 
She knew who she loved, but she could never admit her feelings... What 
would her father say? She sighs again, this time in exaustion from her 
thoughts, as she reaches the front lawn of her house, which was right 
next door to her Grandpa Goku&#39;s.

She walks in the door, and sees no one around. Where were her parents? 
She makes her way to the many rooms of the house, and sees no one, 
still. Her dad wasn&#39;t working today, and her mom was always home... 
What was going on? She makes her way to their bedroom, and slowly 
opens the door. She sees them in one anothers&#39; arms, the sheets around 
them, resting peacefully. She didn&#39;t want to disturb them, so she 
turns, and exits the room. She sighs yet again. Everyone had their 
destined &#39;mates&#39;, except her... Her father, grandfather, Vegeta, 
everyone. Why was she the odd one out?

~*Capsule Corporation*~

Up in her room, Bra is laying on her bed thinking. &#39;I&#39;m bored. Mom and 
dad are gone to visit Goku and Chichi, and Trunks to visit Goten. They 
can be so inconsiderate sometimes, I swear.&#39; she thinks to herself. 
They were all at Goku&#39;s(or Chichi&#39;s) house, but she had decided that 
she didn&#39;t want to go. She was bored out of her mind, and wanted 
someone to talk to... She lays back on her bed, with a stiffled sigh. 
Why everyone but her?

~*Son Residence-G/V/P*~

Pan is sitting on the couch at her house. She throws down the remote 
control, after checking what was on the television. Of course, nothing 
was on, except a news special. Her mom&#39;s friend Erasa had become a 
reporter, and surprisingly was actually good at it. &#39;I could visit 
Bra... Maybe she&#39;s not busy...&#39; thinks Pan, and stands up. She walks 
into the kitchen, and writes a note to her mom and dad saying that she 
is going to visit the Briefs. And, With that, she heads to the door, 
slowly walking out.

~*Son Residence-G/C/G*~

Meanwhile, Goku, Chichi, Piccolo, Vegeta, Bulma and Krillin are all 
sitting at the dinner table, while Goten and Trunks are sparring 
outside. Chichi and Bulma are chatting about Great Grandchildren, and 
Piccolo asks where Gohan is. Krillin starts making dirty jokes about 
Gohan and Videl. Goku and Vegeta are eating.

&quot;So, When do you think they&#39;ll get here?&quot; Chichi asks.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, but we really should wait for Gohan before we say 
anything...&quot; Goku responds. Vegeta merely grunts.

~*Capsule Corporation*~

Pan finally reaches the building, and rings the doorbell once. No 
answer. She rings it again, and still there is no answer. She pushes 
the door open, which was surprisingly unlocked. She walks up the 
stairs towards Bra&#39;s room, and shouts, &quot;BRA?&quot;

Bra hears her, and sits up. She gets up, and walks over to the door, 
opening it, and popping her head out.

&quot;Panny? Is that you?&quot; she asks. Pan smiles, and walks over to the 
other girl.

&quot;Thank goodness you&#39;re here. I was getting bored.&quot; Bra says.

&quot;I was just thinking the same thing...&quot; Pan responds, smiling, &quot;Why 
don&#39;t we spar? I can teach you...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never really had much experience in Martial Arts, but okay. 
Anything is better than sitting up here with nothing to do... But, 
What do you say we use the Gravity Chamber?&quot; Bra suggests.

&quot;Sounds great! But, Will your dad mind?&quot; asks Pan.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so. He let&#39;s Trunks, Goku, and even your dad train in 
there, so we shouldn&#39;t get in trouble...&quot; Bra replies. Pan nods, and 
the start down the stairs.

~*Son Residence-G/V/P*~

Gohan awakens to the smell of food, and automatically gets up, going 
towards the kitchen. The source of the magical smell was Videl&#39;s 
cooking. He walks over to her, unoticing, and wraps his arms around 
her waist, placing her chin on her shoulder, and he kisses her neck. 
She is startled at first.

&quot;Gohan?&quot; Videl asks, turning around.

&quot;So, Where&#39;s Pan?&quot; Gohan asks, looking around.

&quot;I dunno.&quot; replies Videl. Gohan notices a note on the fridge door, and 
takes it off, beginning to read it...

&quot;Dear mom and dad, I&#39;m going to visit the Briefs. Since you were... 
&#39;incopasitated&#39; at the moment, I figured I would see what Bra&#39;s up to. 
Don&#39;t bother fixing me any dinner. I&#39;ll probably be here for at least 
a couple hours. See you later! Luv ya bunches, Panny&quot; he stopped 
reading. He blushes a bit at that second sentence.

&quot;But, Gohan... Aren&#39;t the Briefs at your dad&#39;s house?&quot; Videl asks.

&quot;They were supposed to have a dinner party... OH NO!&quot; Gohan nearly 
shouted.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Videl asks.

&quot;We were supposed to be there too, remember?!&quot; Gohan says, looking at 
the clock.

Videl stops cooking, and puts a finger to her chin, &quot;Hmm... Oh yeah.&quot;

&quot;Well, Let&#39;s go!&quot; Gohan says, and hurries back to their room. As he 
ran through the halls, Videl could hear him say, &quot;Goku and Vegeta 
probably ate all the food!&quot; she sweatdrops, going to change as well...

~*Capsule Corporation*~

Pan and Bra walk to the Gravity Room, as they reach it, Pan says, &quot;Aw 
man. Ya need a code to get in.&quot;

Bra smiles and walks up to the control panel, pushing some buttons, 
and the door raises open, &quot;I&#39;ve saw dad come in here a million times.&quot;

&quot;Cool.&quot; Pan states simply, as the two walk in the now opened door. It 
closes behind them.

&quot;Now.&quot; Bra says, &quot;How about just normal gravity? I&#39;ve never been in 
here before, and I wouldn&#39;t want to be squashed, what a way to go.&quot;

Pan nods, and says, &quot;Alright. First...&quot; she begins teaching Bra the 
basics...

~*Son Residence-G/C/G*~

Gohan and Videl walk in the door. They had their new clothes in, but 
forgot to fix their hair, which was of course a mess.

&quot;So, Gohan. Whatcha been up to?&quot; Goku asks, winking at him. Gohan 
blushes slightly.

Piccolo interrupts saying, &quot;We didn&#39;t know if you were going to make 
it. We have news other than just dinner.&quot;

&quot;Cutting straight to the point, eh?&quot; Goku asks, &quot;Alright, You can 
explain, Vegeta. Afterall, You know more about it.&quot;

&quot;Fine. Spawn of Kakkarot?&quot; Vegeta asks, looking at the demi-saiyan, 
&quot;Brolli, as well as a few more of our enemies have returned, and are 
on a planet called &#39;Tohijin&#39;.&quot;

Goku butts in, &quot;Yeah. And they have all the Tohijins held prisoner. We 
were planning on going to check it out.&quot;

&quot;As I was saying, Will you be accompanying us?&quot; Vegeta asks.

&quot;Sure. I&#39;m up for another fight.&quot; Gohan replies, and Goku says, &quot;Yeah! 
It should be fun! I haven&#39;t had a good fight since Majin Buu!&quot;

&quot;Gohan!&quot; Videl says, causing him to turn to her, &quot;You aren&#39;t going 
anywhere!&quot;

&quot;Sorry hun. I&#39;m goin.&quot; Gohan replies.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I let Goku talk me into it.&quot; Chichi says, &quot;Normally I 
would have said no, but since he asked nicely, and said that Vegeta 
was too weak to do it on his own, I-&quot; she is interrupted by Vegeta, 
&quot;WHAT?! KAKKAROT!&quot; he gives Goku his best deathstare.

Goku holds his arms up in defeat, &quot;Sorry, Vegeta.&quot;

&quot;Oh it&#39;s alright dad. Vegetable-head needs our help, he&#39;s just to 
proud to ask.&quot; Gohan says.

Vegeta stands up, and walks out the door, and into the front lawn.

&quot;Well, If it&#39;s Brolli, then I guess I&#39;m going.&quot; Piccolo says. He 
smirks, popping his knuckles, &quot;I still have to get even from the last 
time we met.&quot;

&quot;Good. The more the marrier.&quot; Goku says. Krillen responds, &quot;I guess 
I&#39;ll just stay home. Besides, It&#39;s you saiyans he wants, and I&#39;d just 
get in the way.&quot;

&quot;Me too.&quot; Yamcha agrees, Tien says the same.

&quot;Well, You&#39;re probably right. But, When he contacted Vegeta, he said 
that he only wanted saiyans to come, with one exception.&quot; Goku says, 
and Piccolo stands up, &quot;We still need to ask if Bra or Pan wants to 
go.&quot;

&quot;Now you listen here Goku! You may take my children with you, but not 
my grandchildren too!&quot; Chichi says.

&quot;They probably won&#39;t want to go anyway. Besides, It would only be for 
a day or so.&quot; Goku says, and Chichi starts arguing back.

Outside, Vegeta rolls his eyes. They would leave tomorrow, whoever was 
going could go with him, or stay home. He really didn&#39;t care.
