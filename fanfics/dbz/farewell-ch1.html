<h1>Farewell</h1>

<pre>&lt;&quot;So you are going, huh?&quot;&gt;

That voice. &lt;Her voice.&gt;

So soft.

So melodic.

Why does it always affect me like that?

I tremble as I turn around and look at her. Wave after wave of
turquoise meet my eyes. So beautiful.

I sigh.

Seeing her standing there, in front of me, a worried look adorning her
beautiful features; I&#39;m lost for words.

&quot;Yeah....maybe they&#39;ll start worrying about me once I&#39;m gone. Maybe
then, they won&#39;t take me for granted. Maybe then, they&#39;ll begin to love
me again.&quot;

I know she knows who I&#39;m talking about. I know she knows I&#39;m talking
about &lt;them&gt;.

Son Gohan.

Videl Satan.

My parents; or so people like to call them.

She is the only one who knows how much I hate them. They don&#39;t care, so
why should I? Today, they took whatever was left of my love and crushed
it under their feet like it was nothing.

Nothing.

&lt;&quot;Daddy, can I help?&quot;&gt;

I wanted to help; I really did.

&lt;&quot;I&#39;m busy, Panny.&quot;&gt;

Oh yeah, you are always busy.

&lt;&quot;Don&#39;t bother me.&quot;&gt;

Ok, I won&#39;t, you can go to hell for all I care.

&lt;&quot;Go with your mother.&quot;&gt;

I thought she&#39;d understand me. I thought she loved me.

&lt;&quot;Mommy, can I help?&quot;&gt;

I thought she wasn&#39;t like him.

&lt;&quot;I&#39;m busy, Panny.&quot;&gt;

But she wasn&#39;t any different.

&lt;&quot;Don&#39;t bother me.&quot;&gt;

They don&#39;t want me around.

&lt;&quot;Go with your father.&quot;&gt;

I already did, bitch!

How could they be so heartless? When did they stop loving me?

Well, fuck them!

They don&#39;t care, so I won&#39;t either. I won&#39;t care anymore.

I look up.

She is still there; standing in front of me. Looking at me with those
beautiful eyes. Deep blue eyes, so beautiful. A woman can get lost in
those eyes.

I can&#39;t bear to look at those eyes. I&#39;m afraid I would do something
stupid.

Like telling her how cute I think she is.

Like caressing her beautiful face.

Like forgetting that feeling this way for her is wrong. So wrong.

Like kissing those lips. Those beautiful rosy lips that she presses
against my own right now.

&quot;Bra....&quot;

She smiles. So beautiful. Just like an angel.

Is this a dream?

&lt;&quot;Come back to me, Panny, I will be waiting.&quot;&gt;

I try to call her name. Nothing comes out.

How does she do it?

I can only watch as she leaves the room, my fingers caressing the trail
of kisses she left over my battered lips.

Sweet kisses.

&quot;Bra....&quot;

So pretty. So wild. So cool. So proud. So unpredictable.

I smile.

Uncle Goten and Trunks are ready to leave with Grandpa Goku. I can hear
them outside. I look at Gohan and Videl. They are not my parents
anymore. Only two strangers.

Two fucking strangers.

The picture shatters against a nearby wall. Finally, I finished
packing. As I look at the new photograph in my hand, a year old picture
of me and Bra, so happy together, smiling at the camera, I realize that
I don&#39;t need anything else. The heavy bag lands on my bed with a thud
as I tug the picture safely under my bandada.

If only they knew.

Smiling, I exit the room. Happy. A new song playing in my heart.
Humming happily, I quietly enter the spaceship. A new adventure.

A new life.

&lt;&quot;Cause you are everywhere to me. And when I close my eyes, it&#39;s you I
see. You are everything I know that makes me believe. I&#39;m not alone...&quot;&gt;

&quot;Hey, Gohan, have you seen Panny?&quot;

&quot;Wasn&#39;t she playing with Bra?&quot;

---

There, the end. For the people that don&#39;t know, Pan and Bra are two
characters from the anime TV series known as Dragon Ball GT. Pan is the
daughter of Gohan and Videl while Bra is Bulma and Vegeta&#39;s daughter.
For the people that have seen the series, you may remember in episode 2
when Gohan and Videl ignore Pan and in better words, tell her to &quot;fuck
off&quot;. I found this kinda cruel, specially since she was trying to help
and they did not have to be so rude. That&#39;s what inspired me to write
this fic. Being a fan of the Pan/Bra couple, I thought it would be cute
for them to say g&#39;bye to each other before the big trip. And so, this
fic was born. As always, praise, flames or comments are always
welcomed. By the way, the lil song Pan hums at the end is &quot;Everywhere&quot;
by Michelle Branch. Ja ne!

&quot;If it&#39;s so wrong, why does it feel so right...&quot; ~who knows
