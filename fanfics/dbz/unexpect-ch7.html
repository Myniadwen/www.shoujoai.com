<a href="../dbz/unexpect-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Bra transmitted to the place she knew Pan would be: the waterfall. The 
very act of Bra being there startled Pan. She had never been to this 
place with the real Bra, ever. Had Tom told her something?

&quot;Go away Bra. I have nothing to say to you.&quot; Pan turned her head away 
from the blue haired Sayin. 

&quot;Pan, I think we need to talk...&quot; Bra did not want to startle Pan. She 
knew that she might feel a little confused, so she wanted this to go 
nice and smooth.

&quot;There is nothing for us to talk about, Bra. You can leave now.&quot; Bra, 
realizing that there was nothing else to do, teleported right in front 
of Pan&#39;s face. All she needed was a spit second, and she started to 
scream. Pan gasped in amazement as Bra transformed into a Super Sayin.

&quot;D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Pan? Does this remind you of something?&quot; Pan was unable to 
speak. How could this be possible?

&quot;Bra? Is that really you?&quot; Pan waited impatiently for the answer.

&quot;That depends on your definition of Bra, Pan.&quot; Pan looked into Bra&#39;s 
eyes and found the answer.

&quot;Oh Bra, I mean Tom, well, whatever I should call you, what happened? 
I thought you said it was permanent!&quot; Pan never really did understand 
all that body switching, but she needed some kind of explanation.

&quot;I told the real Bra to burn her diary, Pan. That&#39;s what caused the 
switch. And it is permanent this time. I couldn&#39;t be without you, 
Pan.&quot; Pan was tearing with happiness.

&quot;You would give up your own body, give up your own gender, just for 
me?&quot; Pan could not stand it any more. At this symbol of immense love, 
at this amazing gift, fell crying into her lover&#39;s arms, unable to 
contain her joy.

Bra cried for joy too. She was in love again, and the roadblock 
between her and the woman she loved was gone. The two lovers held each 
other tight, and hours flew by like seconds. They looked into each 
other&#39;s eyes. No moment to them could possibly be better.

After what seemed like a short time that was in reality 4 hours, the 
two were finally done crying together. Pan walked near the cave with 
Bra.

&quot;Even though my human name is Tom, I think you should call me Bra. It 
will remind both of us of our first 9 days together, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Pan was very pleased to hear this, as she felt the exact same way. 
Calling Bra &quot;Tom&quot; would only confuse things.

&quot;So where do you want to go for our first date of newfound romance, 
Bra?&quot; Pan had an idea in her mind, but she wanted Bra to say first.

&quot;Wherever you want to go, Pan. You are my guide to this world.&quot; Pan 
smiled and whispered, &quot;Hold on to my hand.&quot; Bra obeyed as Pan used 
instant transmission to teleport to an exotic nightclub. 

The club was dimly lit. The music was loud enough to hear the beat, 
but too quiet to hear the words. Two distinct aromas drifted though 
the air. One of nervous perspiration and the other its antidote, hard 
liquor. Bra and Pan had little need of either, but the club was fine 
just the same. The club was, for the most part, a straight club, but 
nobody seemed to complain about Bra and Pan dancing together.

Most of the songs played were slow, which both Bra and Pan liked. On 
these, Bra let Pan lead. Bra had never had any dancing experience as 
Tom, so he was more than happy to let Pan take control. 

It soon became late, and the voice of the crowd had died down enough 
to hear the words of the music. Bra and Pan&#39;s dancing slowed down, and 
then became nothing more than the two girls holding each other close, 
swaying to the beat of the romantic words.

Bra and Pan started to feel like they wanted a little more than just 
dancing. It might have been the fact that the girls held each other so 
close, or the fact that the music was so romantic, or that the day was 
so romantic, but they did not care what the reason was. Pan whispered 
into Bra&#39;s ear. 

&quot;Bra, feel like going to my apartment?&quot; Bra nodded and the two 
disappeared from the club as suddenly as they had entered.

For a girl so young living on her own, it was a very nice apartment. 
But neither of the two Sayins really cared about this. They only cared 
about each other.

Bra followed Pan down the hallway they had teleported to, towards the 
bedroom. As Bra pushed the door open after Pan, the dark haired girl 
came to the end of her patience. Being able to wait no longer, she 
pushed Bra towards the door and started to kiss her. 

As the kiss started to intensify, Bra wrapped her arms around Pan&#39;s 
neck and returned the kiss with her own passion. However, Pan was only 
getting started, and pushed the kiss to a further level. She leaned 
forward, pushing her tongue even deeper into Bra&#39;s mouth. 

Bra could feel Pan&#39;s entire tongue in her mouth. The tip of it seemed 
to touch the back of her throat, and Bra could barely breathe from 
this intense passion. Bra was loving every minute of it, and Pan&#39;s 
tongue continued to move around inside her mouth. This was the best 
kiss Bra had ever had.

Pan seemed to be loving the kiss as much as Bra. She loved to explore 
her mouth, to taster her tongue... She simply could not get enough, 
she had to have more. 

Finally the kiss ended. Bra gasped for air, the intensity of the kiss 
still lingering in her. Pan was rosy cheeked from excitement and 
passion. Bra loved to see her lover blush, and started to turn pink 
herself. 

Pan slowly took off her shirt. She flung it behind her and unclasped 
her red bra, revealing her large, rounded breasts. She slowly slid off 
her pants and her underwear next. Bra started to do the same with her 
own clothing, but Pan gave her a motion to stop. Pan wanted to do this 
herself.

The naked Sayin pulled off Bra&#39;s clothing piece by piece, until only 
her bra remained. As she undid the blue haired girls bra, Pan started 
to suck on Bra&#39;s neck. The two fell onto Pan&#39;s bed, and Pan finished 
undoing her lover&#39;s bra. 

Bra pushed her weight on top of Pan, trying to get a shot at licking 
on of Pan&#39;s breasts. But Pan was quicker, shifting her weight so that 
she completely pinned down Bra. She wrapped her hand around Bra&#39;s neck 
and kissed her hard, taking Bra&#39;s breath away a second time. 

Bra and Pan could feel their nipples right on top of each other. As 
Pan pushed her tongue deeper into Bra&#39;s mouth, they could feel the 
nipples stiffening up against each other. Pan pulled Bra closer to her 
chest, allowing their hard nipples to press up against each other even 
harder, producing a loud groan of pleasure from both girls. After 
nearly twenty minutes of kissing that both girls wished had lasted 
forever, Pan moved her tongue down Bra&#39;s body. She licked her lover&#39;s 
left nipple, then placed it in her mouth and started to suck it, 
feeling it get a little harder in her mouth. She started to suck it 
with all her might, and Bra screamed with pleasure. 

Bra tried a second time to return the favor to Pan; it was in vain as 
Pan forced her down again. Pan giggled as Bra wiggled her shoulders in 
futility. Pan loved to feel Bra&#39;s tongue on her body, but right now 
she needed to have Bra. Not only that, but she owed her a favor.

Pan took her hand out from around Bra&#39;s neck and moved her head down. 
She put her face down on Bra&#39;s orchid and licked at the sweet wetness. 
Bra started screaming with uncontrolled passion as Pan sped up the 
pace, licking with increased speed.

Bra loudly gasped and screamed as she came. Pan slowly licked up the 
sweet honey from Bra&#39;s lower lips. Bra finally recovered her breath 
after two full minutes of panting. 

&quot;I love you Pan.&quot;

&quot;I love you too Bra.&quot; Pan watched the exhausted Bra start to fall 
asleep, as she did on their first night those few weeks ago. Pan was 
neither tired nor satisfied, but she knew that Bra was tired. She 
started to close her eyes...

Bra looked towards Pan. Her plan was working. Pan was closing her 
eyes. Bra, who in fact was very tired but with a purpose in mind, 
powered up into Super Sayin. She would need all the strength she could 
get for this. She moved on top of Pan, holding her down. Pan, who had 
guessed the plan far too late, was no match without powering up. She 
started to transform, but her concentration was broken as Bra slipped 
two fingers deep inside her. 

Pan let out a yell of pleasure, but she was not about to be bested 
yet. She tried to power up a second time, but Bra slipped her three 
fingers, and Pan arched her head back in passion. 

Bra continued to use her three fingers to stimulate Pan, as the dark 
haired girl screamed out loud. Pan started moving her hips up and down 
with Bra&#39;s movement, and she could feel herself drawing near. 

Pan bucked her hips up and down like crazy now, with no rime or 
reason. She yelled out with extreme enjoyment as she overflowed on 
Bra&#39;s hand. Bra smiled and started to lick up the nectar. When she had 
finished, Pan successfully powered up, pushing Bra down. 

Bra pushed back up, and the two powered up Super Sayins were in a 
deadlock, both trying to gain control. Not surprisingly, Pan&#39;s greater 
strength eventually made her the winner. She forced Bra down and made 
sure she could not regain control this time. She used her right hand 
to pull Bra&#39;s head up, and started to tenderly kiss her neck. She used 
her right hand to start rubbing Bra&#39;s womanhood. It had not been a 
very long time since her last orgasm, but she could tell that Bra&#39;s 
body was very ready. 

Bra began to loudly moan. She was feeling an overdose of pleasure from 
Pan&#39;s mouth and hand. After hearing this Pan started to suck on Bra&#39;s 
neck and make her hand move faster. Bra moaned even loader.

Pan was enjoying this as much as Bra was, if that was possible. She 
loved the feeling of holding Bra close to her; her neck was so soft, 
so likable. 

Bra loudly screamed with passion, and felt her entire body go stiff. 
Pan lifted her head up and kissed Bra gently on the forehead. After 
slowly licking Bra clean, she saw that Bra was about to fall asleep. 
As they both powered down, they realized that the sex had been 
perfect, for both of them. Pan lay on top of Bra, putting her head 
down on the pillow next to Bra&#39;s face. As the two Sayins drifted off 
to sleep, they felt forever bound together, by body, by love, by 
passion.
