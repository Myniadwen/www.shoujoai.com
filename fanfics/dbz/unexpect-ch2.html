<h1>Unexpected Changes (part 2 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dbz/index.html">Dragonball Z</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yurifan.html">Yuri Fan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../dbz/unexpect-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Bra awoke with a funny feeling. She did not know how long she had been 
asleep, but she could not wait to see Pan again. She had so much to 
say about the night before. Bra scratched her head. Her hair felt 
funny, almost like...

Bra immediately sat up and looked down at her body. But her body was 
not what she saw. Instead, she saw Tom&#39;s body.

&quot;It was a dream,&quot; thought Tom. &quot;Just a silly dream. How could I have 
not realized it? Traveling to the world of DBZ, sleeping with Pan, 
that&#39;s a good one!&quot; But then, as Tom stretched, he smelled something. 
Perfume. But why was he wearing perfume? He got up out of his bed 
slowly. 

&quot;Didn&#39;t I fall asleep on the couch?&quot; Tom thought as he got up. He 
looked in his mirror and got a shock. There was a lipstick stain on 
his lip. &quot;So it was real,&quot; thought Tom. He was about to go brush his 
teeth when he did a double take and looked at the lipstick again. 
Something was wrong. The lipstick... Of course! This lipstick was 
glittery! Pan&#39;s lipstick wasn&#39;t like that! At realizing this Tom&#39;s 
heart fell. If it wasn&#39;t Pan&#39;s lipstick, then he never kissed Pan. Tom 
really wanted it not to be a dream... But if he didn&#39;t kiss Pan...who 
did he kiss? He remembered that he was alone when he fell asleep...

Tom&#39;s train of thought was interrupted by a voice coming from his bed.

&quot;Morning handsome. Was last night as good for you as it was for me?&quot; 
The voice was a woman&#39;s, but it was too drippy to be Pan&#39;s. Tom turned 
around and stared at the face of a girl he never met before. She had 
long, blonde hair, and looked very different from Pan. Where Pan was 
more sexy than beautiful, this girl seemed so pretty and innocent he 
could not imagine sleeping with her. She looked so feminine, almost 
too perfect to be touched. Not at all like Pan. Pan did not have such 
perfect beauty, but she had a sexually erotic look about her. Pan was 
the kind of girl who you want to hold you down kiss you until you 
cannot breathe. Tom knew, as he had this kind of experience last 
night. But was that all a dream? What had happened? He fell asleep and 
then he picked up a girl while sleepwalking? No that was too bizarre 
to be real. 

&quot;So when are you going to tell me your real name? To tell you the 
truth I usually like to find out a guys name before I sleep with them, 
but I guess after will have to do.&quot; Tom slowed hard.

&quot;Um, it&#39;s Tom.&quot;

&quot;Well at least now you give me an honest answer. Last night at the 
club you kept referring to yourself as an undergarment, and let me 
tell you it wasn&#39;t as funny you thought it was insisting on it on and 
on.&quot; The girl looked up at Tom like she expected some kind of joke in 
response, but Tom was deep in thought.

&quot;Undergarment? Oh of course! Bra! But...&quot; Tom suddenly realized the 
truth. &quot;I didn&#39;t just go to Bra&#39;s world, she went to mine too! We 
traded bodies!&quot; Tom knew that he definitely needed time to sort all of 
this out, so he acted fast.

&quot;I loved last night a lot yes, but I have to go to work. I will drive 
you home if you want.&quot; Tom said rather quickly. Tom was a freelance 
author, so technically he could work whenever he wanted. But he needed 
some time to think on what had happened.

&quot;You are so sweet. But we took our own cars remember?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, well I will have to lock up. I&#39;ll get changed and then we can 
go.&quot;

The girl on his bed pouted like a little child, and then said &quot;I hope 
I can see you again soon.&quot; Normally a girl like this would have been 
his type, but all he could think about was Pan. &quot;Pan would never pout 
like a kid like that. Pan wouldn&#39;t...&quot; Tom tried to shake the girl out 
of his head. &quot;You can&#39;t be in love with Pan, you barely met her. All 
you did was sleep with her while you were in another body. That just 
CAN&#39;T be love.&quot; Tom tried to convince himself, but the more he thought 
about his night with pan, the more he wanted to be with her again.


After the girl had gone, Tom sat in his room, thinking. He wanted to 
go back to the world of DBZ, back to the world were he had someone to 
love, back to the world of Pan... but there were so many things to 
think about. He had the girl in his room that morning to consider. She 
was pretty...but to have sex with a guy without knowing his name? Tom 
wanted a real relationship, not a one night stand. 

But Bra had had a real relationship. That was another thing that 
bothered him. Bra was in love with Pan, but she used my body to pick 
up a girl when she was me. Why would she do something like that? Maybe 
Bra wasn&#39;t happy with Pan. Maybe she wanted a different kind of girl. 
Tom remembered how different Pan looked and sounded from the girl in 
his bed.
&quot;Bra might be just as happy in my body as I am in hers.&quot; Tom said out 
loud. But before he went back into the DBZ world, he still had some 
questions that needed to be answered. Why did he leave the Dragon Ball 
Z world? What did Bra do when she got her body back? How could he stay 
there longer next time? What if next time Tom could not go back? Would 
he be stuck in Bra&#39;s body? Would he be happy about that?

Tom knew deep down that he would not need to answer any of those 
questions. He just knew he had to try to see Pan again. He went to his 
couch and picked up the DBZ fan fiction story. As soon as he read the 
first three sentences, he felt himself black out...


Tom awoke in a room that was very familiar. The blue wallpaper, the 
soft bed, he knew it was Bra&#39;s room. He looked down at himself and 
found he was Bra again. Because Pan was obviously a lesbian Bra knew 
that she had to be a girl in order to get Pan to like her. But deep 
inside, Bra wished that she could keep her Tom body when she was with 
Pan. She still was a little uncomfortable with the idea of being a 
girl. 

Bra looked around the room. She was alone, but remembering how Pan had 
fooled her yesterday she crept to the closet and opened the door. 
Unfortunately the closet was empty. Or rather, almost empty. Bra found 
a small black book on the floor. She opened it up and read what was 
inside.

June 17: Dear Diary, last night I had the most amazing dream! I dreamt 
that I was in the body of a man, and I met the most amazing girl! Her 
name was Amber, and I slept with her! Even though I know it was just a 
dream, it was such a vivid dream I feel as guilty as if I had really 
cheated on Pan. We have only had our feelings for each other for three 
weeks, and I cheated on her! She would never do something like that to 
me! Amber made it all worth it though. She is so different that Pan. 
She is so mild, so tender. And for the first time ever I got to hold 
her down while she struggled...ooh it was so good. But I can&#39;t think 
that! It would break Pan&#39;s heart if she knew I dreamed about another 
woman, especially a woman so different from her, especially one that I 
preferred in every way! I am going to have to put you away now, diary. 
I just woke up, but I am getting a little tired. I&#39;ll write tomor

The last word was left unfinished.

&quot;Bra must have wrote this just minutes before I read the story,&quot; 
thought Bra to herself. She put the diary back into the closet and 
left her room, wanting to find the front door. After getting a little 
confused Bra finally found it, and was a little shocked as she saw who 
was right outside.
