<h1>Frustrated Wives of the Super Warriors</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dbz/index.html">Dragonball Z</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tenkaistar.html">The Tenkai Star</a><br> </h2>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The Cell Games have been announced. 
Goku, Trunks, Vegeta, and Gohan know of the threat the evil bio-android 
faces to the innocent people of the universe. Cell had announced several 
days ago that he would start the tournament in exactly ten days. With 
the fate of millions on the line Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Trunks, and Piccolo 
went on their ways to train hard for the upcoming battle.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">It has been four days since the 
announcement, it was quiet in the Son household. The only activity the 
house had was the wife of the great Super Saiyan Warrior Goku, Chichi, 
sitting on a chair in the kitchen reading a magazine in the sunlight 
that shined through the window behind her. The sink was empty as she 
washed all the dishes, the floors and counters were so clean its as 
if nobody with an appetite like Goku had ever been there. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi thumbed through the pages 
of the gossip magazine with a sigh. She felt lonely, her husband and 
son were gone for such a long time to train, the last time she ever 
seen Goku was last night when she cooked him dinner. That moment hardly 
lasted due to Goku&#39;s inhuman eating habits as he ate over twelve plates 
of food within the span of one minute, then left again with Gohan to 
go train.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">As her depression sank in she heard 
a knock at the door. Finally, somebody. As she walked to the door thoughts 
ran through her head as to who could it be. It couldn&#39;t be her karate 
bum husband. If it was him she would have made dinner for him. She calmly 
opened the door to see a familiar friend.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Bulma? What are you doing here?” 
said a surprised Chichi, as this was the first person to ever come see 
her in a long time that didn&#39;t involve food being on the line.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Hi, Chichi. It&#39;s been awhile 
since either of us ever spent any time with each other, so I thought 
I&#39;d come visit for awhile. May I come in?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh, why sure, Bulma. Come on 
in, I just had the place all cleaned up and everything.” The blue-haired 
beauty walked through the doorway and looked around the house.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Wow, I can tell. The place looks 
great.” she said. She took a big wiff of the air. “It smells nice 
in here.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Well thanks, I lit a few of 
these aroma scented candles in here. I don&#39;t usually have them lit due 
to Goku&#39;s constant clumsiness and working out might knock them over 
and burn the damn house down.” Chichi responded.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma giggled at the thought. “Yeah, 
that Goku, he&#39;s got a lot of heart, but not very much upstairs if you 
know what I mean.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The two ladies sat down at the 
kitchen table. Chichi poured two cups of coffee and sat each cup on 
either side of the table. Chichi happily sat down and took a sip from 
her cup.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“So, where is Goku and Gohan?” 
asked Bulma.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh those two? Well ever since 
that monster Cell has announced the Cell Games those two hardly ever 
come home anymore. They&#39;re up on Mount Paozu and training. I swear, 
if they keep that up that entire mountain will be reduced to rubble.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">As if on Chichi&#39;s cue, a small 
tremor shook the ground the house was standing on.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“There they go again. Using their 
massive powers to make themselves stronger. It&#39;s like that&#39;s all those 
boys care about is their strength, not one bit about me. The only time 
I ever get to see them is when I cook them dinner, but then they gobble 
every bit of it down like a school of piranha fish. Then after that 
they run back up to that mountain and go back to training.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh, I know how you feel, Chichi.” 
said Bulma. “Vegeta does that, too. He trains in my father&#39;s gravity 
generator at 400 times earth&#39;s normal gravity. He only ever comes out 
to demand that I make him some food. Every time I try to talk to him 
he just yells at me and tells me &#39;You&#39;re in my way of obtaining a level 
higher than that of a super saiyan. I&#39;ll never defeat Kakarot if you 
keep interrupting me like this.&#39; Thank god I was able to get father 
to watch Trunks while I am over here.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Those ungrateful men. We offer 
them our love, cook them food, and even give birth to their children, 
and they show us nothing for it. We deserve better than this!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma takes a swig of her coffee.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Yeah, really. At least the Trunks 
from the future shows gratitude a helps out around the house and helps 
keep an eye on baby Trunks once in awhile. It’s a shame his father 
is such a fucking prick.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi looks down at her cup with 
a frown. </font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“I&#39;m sexually starved... only 
time Goku ever attempted to make love to me was when we were first married. 
He barely did that right, I swear, the man thought my vagina was a place 
I can put food in like a mouth. He doesn&#39;t even know how to keep his 
own strength in check, he knocked me out of the bed quite a few times. 
My pussy was sore for a week afterward. I know he means well, but he 
just doesn&#39;t learn much.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“That&#39;s how I felt when I first 
made love to Vegeta. He was so rough, I thought he would have killed 
me in that bed. My legs were so sore afterward that I walked with a 
limp for a few days. It&#39;s hard to believe those Saiyans ever managed 
to populate their species without literally splitting their mates in 
half during intercourse. At least it was better than when I did it with 
that dork Yamcha. It&#39;s like every man I&#39;ve ever met is either bad in 
bed or just a total loser.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi looks up from her cup.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“I swear, if it wasn&#39;t for the 
fact that he and I have a son together I&#39;d leave him. The poor man would 
probably starve to death if it wasn&#39;t for me being able to cook food 
for him.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma looked into Chichi&#39;s beautiful 
brown eyes, and slightly down her body.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“You know, I don&#39;t see why any 
man wouldn&#39;t want you. You&#39;re a great wife, and you&#39;re very beautiful 
too. Any man would probably die just to be with you. That Goku should 
be more appreciative of you.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi looked directly into Bulma&#39;s 
lovely green eyes too.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Thanks. I think the same about 
you. You&#39;re very lovely. I remember how great you looked when I saw 
you in the audience of the World Martial Arts tournament.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma then blushed at Chichi&#39;s 
words.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Thank you, at least somebody 
thinks so. You know, I bought this brand new dress recently. One that 
shows off lots of.. stuff. Maybe I can use it to entice Vegeta to pay 
attention to me now. I spent quite a bit of money on it so I hope it 
works.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi blushed at the thought of 
what Bulma in a revealing dress would look like.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Bulma, can I see it?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma&#39;s head swam over the idea 
of another attractive woman looking at her in her revealing dress. She 
took the chance and agreed.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Sure. I&#39;ll be happy to show 
it to you.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Okay. Can I come by after I 
give Goku and Gohan their diner for the night? They will probably smell 
it all the way from there when I start cooking it soon.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Sure!” said Bulma. “We&#39;ll 
even have drinks, too.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi stood up with a smile on 
her face. “Oh that sounds great. I can&#39;t wait!”</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The two women then chit-chatted 
for a few hours. Bulma told Chichi of all the adventures she, Krillin, 
and Gohan had on Namek. Chichi would regale stories she had when she 
was a child with Goku. After awhile mid-day finally came.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Well, Bulma. I think it&#39;s about 
time I make dinner for those two right about now.”</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Okay, Chichi.” said the blue-haired 
woman. “I better go home and check on Trunks. I guess I&#39;ll see you 
later on tonight.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma got up out of her seat, and 
kept her eyes on Chichi as she walked out of the kitchen and out the 
front door. Once she was outside she looked up at the orange mid-day 
sky. Sighing, she reached into her back pocket to pull out a Capsule. 
She pressed the button and threw it on the ground to make her own personal 
hovercraft appear before her. She got in, took one last look at Chichi&#39;s 
house, and drove off.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">About an hour passed since the 
two women talked over coffee. Chichi had laid out a gigantic dinner 
(rather gigantic by human standards, as it was enough food to feed a 
family of ten.) Fried rice plates, sweet and sour chicken, pork dumplings, 
roast duck, barbecue steak, all kinds of delicious foods anybody would 
be grateful to eat. Once she finished setting the table she opened the 
kitchen window. She stared out of it, expecting Goku and Gohan to come 
running down. Just then she heard a high pitched loud swish directly 
behind her. It startled her, and quickly she spun around to see the 
visage of a familiar warrior wearing an orange gi, with a young boy 
next to him.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“WAAAAH! Goku?! How did you get 
here so fast?” exclaimed Chichi.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh, Chichi. I didn&#39;t mean to 
startle you. I noticed dinner was ready so I warped here with my instant 
transmission technique.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Well, you could have used the 
door, like a normal husband.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Yeah, but then the food would 
have gotten cold. After all, I was on that big mountain far away from 
the house.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Goku and Gohan turned their heads 
toward the kitchen and noticed all the food on the table. A big childish 
grin stretches across Goku&#39;s face.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Alright! Your mom made us a 
great dinner, Gohan. Let&#39;s eat!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Yeah, all this training in my 
new Super Saiyan form sure makes me work up a major appetite,” said 
Gohan.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The two saiyan warriors rush to 
the table and start shoveling down the food. Goku and Gohan didn&#39;t even 
bother with the utensils, they eat so fast that their hands don&#39;t even 
have time to get sauce and grease all over them. It was like a pack 
of piranhas ripping a full sized animal to its bones in a matter of 
seconds.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi walked over to Goku and 
started whispering something in his ear.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Goku, I got something to show 
you in the bedroom later on tonight. Will you take a night off from 
training and spend it with me?”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Goku stopped shoveling food in 
his mouth for a few seconds to respond back to Chichi.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Is it food? I thought you don&#39;t 
allow food in any part of the house other than the kitchen,” muffled 
Goku with a mouth full of sweet and sour chicken. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi then fell down in shock 
over the fact that Goku was totally dense on the subject. Chichi then 
started raising her voice at Goku.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Goku, you dense idiot! Is that 
all you can think about is your bottomless stomach? You don&#39;t even know 
what the hell I&#39;m talking about do you?!” Chichi shouted to Goku, 
with her face literally a few inches from Goku&#39;s ear.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Gohan stopped eating and got curious.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“What are you talking about, 
mom?” said the young child Super Saiyan.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“I don&#39;t know, son. What does 
it mean, Chichi?” responded Goku.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi literally stood there with 
her mouth hanging open in amazement at how dense the father of her own 
son was about sex. She refrained from explaining it to her husband since 
Gohan was obviously too young to be hearing about this.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“You know what, Goku, never mind! 
Just eat your dinner,” Chichi growled.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Goku then undauntedly turned back 
to his food and continued to stuff dumplings in his mouth. Chichi walked 
into the living room of the house and sat down on a chair, still upset 
over her dense, food-obsessed husband. The sounds of them chewing and 
gnawing at the food can be heard all the way in the other room. Finally 
they finished eating. Goku stood up stretching his arms and back up.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Well Gohan, that was an awesome 
dinner. Maybe next time your mom will cook up some more. Okay let&#39;s 
go back to training.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Okay, dad,” Gohan said with 
excitement in his voice. The boy ran over to his dad&#39;s side. Goku placed 
his hand on Gohan&#39;s head, and with a flash and a high pitched woosh 
the two Super Saiyans vanished out of the house via Goku&#39;s instant transmission 
skill. Chichi walked into the kitchen to survey the damage that her 
husband and son may have left behind. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">All the plates, bowls, and cups 
were left behind, with every trace of food totally picked off. Even 
the bones of the meat they ate were completely picked clean. The flatware 
was so clean that the only thing Chichi had to do was throw away the 
bones and put the dishes away.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Grrrr... GOD DAMN MEN!” Chichi 
shouted in a voice loud enough that Goku could have possibly heard it 
all the way from the mountain.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi started fuming and sat back 
down on the chair in the living room. Groaning in anger, nothing could 
ever make her forget about her husband, who put her off just to train. 
She was emotionally and sexually frustrated. Her mind was running at 
a million miles an hour, but one person stuck in her mind when she thought 
of her. She immediately thought of Bulma. She was just as upset with 
her man as she was. The words she said on how Bulma&#39;s looks made her 
something every man would want, and she was imagining what Bulma looked 
like naked. It somehow put Chichi&#39;s mind at ease, all the anger she 
had towards her karate bum husband were forgotten, she sat there smiling, 
whispering Bulma&#39;s name to herself. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">She then remembered she was invited 
over to Bulma&#39;s house in the city for drinks and to see her new revealing 
dress. Maybe a few drinks will help her relax. She grabbed a Capsule 
Corp brand flying car capsule and walked out the front door.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Meanwhile, back at the Brief residence 
Bulma sat on the outside patio. Sitting in the back yard was the Capsule 
Corp&#39;s space ship, inside loud flashes of light, loud blasts, and yells 
come from the inside of the spaceship. Bulma new that her current lover, 
Vegeta was inside training at 400 times earth&#39;s normal gravity. Bulma 
knew Vegeta had been in there all day. He usually comes out of the heavily 
gravitated spaceship only for food and water, as there was none in the 
ship. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The front door of the spaceship 
swung open. A familiar blue spandex and white space-armour wearing Prince 
of Saiyans stepped out. Still sporting a familiar scowl on his face, 
his clothes were showing tears and his armor showed signs of damage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma ran over to Vegeta and put 
her hands together, looking in the sour Saiyan Warrior&#39;s face with glee.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh, Vegeta. You finally took 
a break from training. I thought you&#39;d be in there till you died or 
something.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh, it&#39;s you,” grumbled Vegeta. 
“What do you want?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Well, Vegeta. It&#39;s been awhile 
since the two of us did anything together. The left side of my bed is 
rather empty. What do you say we go up there. I bought a new dress for 
the occasion that I thought you might like,” Bulma said as she winked 
at Vegeta.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Sounds like a waste of time. 
Time I could be spending to increase my strength.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma was hit with disappointment.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“But Vegeta, don&#39;t you love me? 
I&#39;m the only woman who cared for you. I had your son. I&#39;m even giving 
you the means to train. Don’t you think I deserve at least some kind 
of attention?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Vegeta paused while his back was 
turned to the blue-haired beauty.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Let me make this clear to you, 
woman. I care nothing for you or that wretched boy. Nothing else matters 
to me! My only concern is to train and surpass the level of Super Saiyan, 
defeat Cell, and then destroy that fool Kakarott.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“But...”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Damnit, Bulma! The time I spend 
with you is time I could spend training!” Vegeta barked. “You&#39;re 
nothing to me, I regret getting intimate with you back then. Now leave 
me alone. If you bother me again I will NOT hesitate to reduce you AND 
everyone here to vapor. Now GET LOST!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Vegeta strolled into the house 
while still scowling and muttering under his breath. Bulma&#39;s rage grew 
even more as her saiyan lover walked into the house for food.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“FUCKING MEN!” shouted Bulma, 
a shout so loud that it echoed throughout the city and scared a flock 
of birds out of a tree nearby. She walked back inside the house, still 
fuming from her ordeal.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">She made it to the front room of 
the house, which was far from the kitchen, where Vegeta was eating. 
She sat down on a chair, with the light of the room provided by a small 
reading lamp. She looked at a framed picture of all her friends she 
met on her adventures long ago that was sitting next to the lamp. It 
had everybody, Goku, Tien, Yamcha, Yajirobe, Yamcha, Chaotsu, Krillin, 
and finally Chichi. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">She gazed upon Chichi in the picture 
and remembered how she looked in the World Martial Arts Tournament facing 
off against Goku. She closed her eyes and started to slowly place her 
right hand by her crotch with her red cheeks and a big smile on her 
face. She then proceeded to slide her hand underneath her short skirt 
and slightly wet pink panties. She teased her snatch for a few seconds 
only to be interrupted by the sound of the doorbell ringing. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">She stood up and walked towards 
the door only to notice her hand is slightly sticky and wet. Before 
answering the door she ran in the bathroom to rinse off her hand. After 
rinsing it in cold water she quickly went to the door. She then straightened 
out her hair and opened the door.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">She looked out the door to notice 
a familiar black haired woman. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh, Chichi, you made it,” 
Bulma said with excitement.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Hello, Bulma,” said Chichi 
as she slipped a Dyno-Cap in her front pocket.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“I&#39;ve been waiting for you.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi walked into the door when 
Bulma gestured her to come in. She walked in Bulma gently put her hand 
on Chichi&#39;s lower back, and slowly towards her butt. Chichi slightly 
blushed, she didn&#39;t mind Bulma&#39;s hand so close to somewhere private. 
Bulma led Chichi to her vacant bedroom at the other side of the house. 
There was a bed on the far end of the room built for two people, with 
one side having a slight indention as if somebody had slept there before, 
but the other side was spotless. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“So, where&#39;s Vegeta and Trunks?” 
Chichi asked.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Vegeta? Oh, that asshole. He&#39;s 
probably done eating and back to training by now. Trunks is probably 
asleep by now, same with baby Trunks,” responded Bulma.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Figures.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma reached behind a dresser 
on the opposite side of the room and grabs a large ceramic jug from 
behind it.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“So, how about a drink, Chichi?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Um, sure. That&#39;s what I&#39;m here 
for right now after all,” giggled Chichi.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma grabbed a pair of small sake 
cups from behind the dresser where she grabbed the jug. She handed one 
to Chichi and poured a small amount of liquid from the jug into the 
cup. Chichi was reluctant to try the drink, but she eventually decided 
to take a drink. She almost choked on the strong taste and burn from 
the liquid.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Ack! What is this stuff? It 
tastes like something you&#39;d put in the engine of a car,” said Chichi.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“It&#39;s a special blend of liquor. 
I got it from Master Roshi&#39;s place. He said he made it himself. I admit 
it&#39;s strong, but it really helps me unwind.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma poured some of the jug into 
another small cup and drank a little bit herself. She then sat down 
on the bed and sighed as the liquor hit her hard. Chichi then noticed 
Bulma&#39;s reaction to the drink and decided to try taking another drink 
from her own cup. She took a swig and managed to actually swallow it. 
The rush of the alcohol slightly overwhelmed her, she too was knocked 
off her feet and landed on the bed, almost spilling the content of her 
cup. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Holy shit. My head is swimming. 
What did Roshi use to make this stuff, lighter fluid?” said Chichi.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma then giggled, then took another 
swig of her cup, finishing the rest of it. Bulma layed back on the right 
side of the bed, her hand carelessly landing on top of Chichi&#39;s. Chichi 
noticed the feeling of Bulma&#39;s smooth skin on her hand. She started 
looking at Bulma&#39;s figure then, she lustfully stared at Bulma&#39;s silky 
legs that were exposed from her short dress, then all the way up to 
her torso and her cleavage which separated as Bulma exhaled. Chichi 
then finished off her drink and cleared her throat, with a blush in 
her face and nervousness in her voice.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Ahem, so. Bulma! You said something 
about an expensive dress you tried to use entice Vegeta.” asked Chichi.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh yeah, that. I still have 
it, wanna see how it looks on me?” said Bulma.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“I&#39;d love to,” said Chichi, 
with some childish enthusiasm in her voice.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma the smiled and stood up, 
setting her empty cup on the nightstand. She casually strolled to the 
closet that was opposite of the wall and opened it. Chichi smiled and 
leaned forward with excitement as Bulma reached inside. The sound of 
metal hangers clicking together echoed in the room. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma finally pulled out a hanger 
with a small skimpy yellow dress on it. This dress looked like it was 
at least two sizes too small for anybody to wear, it was heavy intimate-wear. 
Chichi then imagined what Bulma would have looked in it.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oooh, that looks really stunning. 
Can you try it on?” asked Chichi.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Sure, I&#39;ll go change and come 
right back.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“No no no, you can change here. 
I don&#39;t mind,” Chichi giggled.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma blushed and felt a slight 
dampness in her panties as she imagined getting naked in front of Chichi. 
She really wanted to undress in front of her, little did she know that 
Chichi was anxious to see Bulma&#39;s exposed body. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma then nodded with a grin and 
turned around. Bulma slipped off her red shirt and threw it at Chichi. 
Chichi caught it and giggled, then took a sniff of the shirt as Bulma 
turned around and not noticed. Bulma then pulled her short skirt down 
passed her legs, bending over with her butt pointed at Chichi, hoping 
she&#39;d notice her pink panties, and Chichi could tell she was excited 
about it as she noticed a slight damp spot between the legs when she 
bent over. Bulma&#39;s bright pink nipples got hard as she stood back up 
and realized the girl she now had a crush on was watching her get almost 
nude.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma then slipped the yellow dress 
on, which miraculously fit. It almost exposed Bulma&#39;s butt and panties 
while it was on as Chichi was still able to see them with Bulma&#39;s back 
turned to her. She then turned around, Chichi blushed harder as this 
dress was very cleavage revealing as the dress barely covered her nipples.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“What do you think?” Bulma 
asked.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“It&#39;s stunning. I don&#39;t see why 
any man wouldn&#39;t want you in that. You&#39;re... gorgeous,” stuttered 
Chichi.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Thanks.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma walked over to Chichi and 
sat down next to her on the bed.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Chichi, you know how you and 
I are having problems with our men?” Bulma asked.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Yeah, that lousy Goku ran off 
with Gohan after he ate enough food to feed a platoon of soldiers,” 
Chichi huffed.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Well, maybe it&#39;s just Roshi&#39;s 
liquor working in me, but I think I’ve had it with men for awhile... 
maybe... girls aren&#39;t a bad idea after all.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi&#39;s eyes widened at that thought.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Really? You mean you like girls, 
too?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Well... kind of. I remember 
back in high school I was in the girls&#39; locker room and showering after 
a gym class. There was this black haired girl in the shower with me.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma was looking down at the floor 
as she said this.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“What about her?” Chichi asked 
curiously.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Her body was glistening in the 
water from the shower. She was lathering her body. I couldn&#39;t stop staring 
at her breasts, her ass, her pussy. I loved it.. I just wanted to kiss 
her all over her body.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi put her hand on Bulma&#39;s 
left leg.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“I know. I noticed how excited 
you got when you were changing into that sexy dress for me,” Chichi 
said.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“How... did you know?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“I saw that your panties were 
wet,” Chichi whispered in Bulma&#39;s ear.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi then decided to lick the 
rim of Bulma&#39;s ear. Chichi then kissed Bulma&#39;s cheek. Bulma stood there 
staring into space as the raven-haired housewife kissed her. Bulma then 
turned around and returned the kiss to Chichi. The two women kissed 
for a few seconds in a moment that seemed like hours. Neither one was 
too shy about it either, as thoughts of Goku and Vegeta were like things 
of the past, as the only ones for them were of each other. Bulma wasn&#39;t 
shy about sliding her tongue deep into Chichi&#39;s mouth, the strong taste 
of Master Roshi&#39;s liquor was tasted in their mouths.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">As they kissed Chichi caressed 
Bulma&#39;s back with her fingertips while Bulma slightly moaned, she really 
enjoyed Chichi&#39;s kiss and soft touch of her hand. Bulma proceeded to 
brush her hand on Chichi&#39;s right thigh, gently sliding her hand up Chichi&#39;s 
leg while her other had padded Chichi&#39;s hip. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma broke the kiss for a moment 
and kissed Chichi&#39;s cheek passionately as Chichi rested her left hand 
on the back of Bulma&#39;s head. Bulma then started to lick and kiss the 
side of Chichi&#39;s neck, Chichi couldn&#39;t help but close her eyes and exhale 
with passion. Chichi gently licked the blue-haired beauty&#39;s ear, which 
caused Bulma to slightly moan in ecstacy.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh, Bulma, don&#39;t stop. You&#39;re 
making me so wet!” moaned Chichi.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Really? Let me feel,” commanded 
Bulma.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma kept kissing Chichi&#39;s neck 
while one hand was feeling up Chichi&#39;s left breast. She slid the other 
inside Chichi&#39;s pants, her panties felt wet to the touch, very wet! 
Chichi sure wasn&#39;t kidding around. Chichi laid back and slid her pants 
down to her knees. Bulma then rubbed her thumb against the crotch part 
of Chichi&#39;s wet pink panties, making them wetter.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi slipped her top off over 
her head exposing her perky breasts held up with a light pink bra.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“You&#39;re wearing the same color 
panties I have on, my sweet,” said Bulma as she winked. She then kissed 
Chichi&#39;s stomach, Chichi giggled a bit as she was slightly ticklish. 
Bulma then slid Chichi&#39;s panties down to her knees with her teeth in 
a seductive manner.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi then licked Bulma&#39;s perky 
breasts at the nipple. Bulma liked the feel of Chichi&#39;s tongue teasing 
her breast, as it made her grin. She then brought her face lower, licking 
her stomach, and all the way down to Bulma&#39;s exposed wet snatch. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi decided to have a taste 
and see what it was really like. She flicked her tongue against Bulma&#39;s 
erect clit.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The flicks of Chichi&#39;s tongue was 
a rapid fire ecstasy that made her give out a shrill high pitched moan 
with each flick. It continued for roughly six minutes until Bulma let 
out a large wet orgasm and squirted girlcum on Chichi&#39;s face. Chichi 
licked some of the sweet nectar from her face.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma then leaned in to kiss Chichi 
as well as lick some of the mess off Chichi&#39;s face. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi then seductively crawled 
over to the opposite side of the bed. She then spread her legs open, 
with one leg in the air and her clit exposed and erect. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Bulma, I think it&#39;s time we 
brought this night of fun to an all time high.” Chichi said as she 
winked.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma then got an idea. She smiled 
greatly, looking into her lover&#39;s eyes. She then crawled to Chichi and 
spread her legs, like Chichi, and pressed her exposed snatch against 
Chichi&#39;s. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi leaned herself onto Bulma. 
At this point, everything they loved about eachother was joined in unison, 
breast to breast, mouth to mouth, pussy to pussy. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma and Chichi began to rub and 
bump their clits against each other, creating heavy pleasure between 
the two female lovers. Bulma had such intense sensations that she couldn&#39;t 
contain herself.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh god, oh Chichi, oh Chichi! 
I looove you!” Bulma moaned.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi leaned in to kiss Bulma 
deeply, pressing their bodies together tighter, creating large amounts 
of sweat that mixed with the warm wetness of their pussies, that created 
an intoxicating aroma both of them loved.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh my god, Bulma. I&#39;m about 
to come!” moaned Chichi.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“So am I, come with me, Chichi!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">After a few seconds they both hit 
a massive orgasm, ones that were so intense that neither of them had 
with either Goku or Vegeta. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Both lovers then collapsed on opposite 
sides of the bed, panting like they had just ran a marathon. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma crawled over to Chichi and 
held her tightly.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“That was amazing. I never experienced 
sex like that with any man before. I love you, Chichi.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi wrapped her arms around 
Bulma and kissed her.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“I love you too, Bulma. I never 
felt anything that amazing with Goku in all my years of being married 
to him.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma then looked at the clock 
on the cabinet next to the bed.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Wow, it&#39;s getting late,” she 
said. “We’d better get to sleep soon... would you like to sleep 
here with me?” Bulma said with a wink.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“Oh shit. I better get home soon, 
so I can get up early enough to cook Goku and Gohan&#39;s breakfast. Lord 
knows that will take me a long time to make.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bulma then locked deeply with Chichi&#39;s 
eyes.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">“I understand, I might have to 
cook a lot for Trunks and Vegeta. You know those Saiyans, they can protect 
a village, but they can starve it in a matter of a day. But before you 
go... can we at least kiss one more time?”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Chichi smiled and proceeded to 
make out with her new lover, knowing that best night of intimacy of 
her life was with a woman, and they both loved it.</font></p>
