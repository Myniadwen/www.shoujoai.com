<pre>What a day!

For Son Pan, only daughter of Son Gohan and Videl Satan; the only word
that could describe this day was....

&quot;Perfect.&quot;

Totally and absolutely perfect. The best day of her life.

As she walked toward her grandfather&#39;s home on the outskirts of Satan
City, her thoughts began to wander over her perfect day. After a
wonderful summer, spent on her grandpa&#39;s house away from the city;
today, she finally started high school. She was a women now. A
beautiful, black haired, 16 year old women. On her mind, the events of
the day kept on playing over and over again.


*************


As always, her first class had been homeroom; the same way it had been
since she was on pre-school and as always, she arrived late. 15 minutes
late to be exact. On her classroom, the homeroom period had already
started. Line after line of neatly dressed students in black and white
uniforms sat on identical desks reading their textbooks. As she entered
the crowded room, she could clearly see the icy look her teacher gave
her from behind her desk. It chilled her blood, just looking at her.

&quot;If looks could kill&quot; she thought as she hurriedly sat on an empty desk
in the second row and gave the old teacher her most innocent, &quot;aren&#39;t I
a good girl&quot; smile. A small gasp escaped her parted lips as she
realized that the whole class was suddenly talking.

Talking about her.

&quot;Look at the new girl; in all my life, I haven&#39;t seen such an ugly
bitch.&quot;

&quot;God, and look at that hair, bet it&#39;s full of mites.&quot;

&quot;Probably; and that stupid red bandada, what does she think this
is....pre-school&quot;

&quot;Man, miss Takegawa is so pissed, just look at her...the lil slut is in
for it now.&quot;

A loud &quot;shut the hell up&quot; interrupted the nasty comments of the aroused
class. It was the teacher. Takegawa-sensei. Pan sighed, relieved that
they had stopped with their cruel comments. She just arrived and they
were already making fun of her.

Why?

Why must people be so cruel to her? Why couldn&#39;t they just leave her
alone; forget that she even existed? She could feel the tears swelling
in her eyes, it was not fair, but she valiantly held them back. This
wasn&#39;t a time to cry. She was a Son. Daughter of Son Gohan.
Granddaughter of Son Goku; two of the greatest martial artists on the
entire universe. She had to be strong for them. Looking up; she was
surprised to see her teacher staring at her, that cold, icy look still
on her eyes. It felt as if she was looking straight into her soul. She
gasped.

&quot;Son Pan, you arrived 15 minutes late to my class and now, you
purposely break the order, inciting the other students to rebel against
my authority; you do know this actions can&#39;t go unpunished, young lady.
Get on your knees!&quot;

Pan couldn&#39;t believe it. Was she serious. &quot;But miss Takegawa....&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Takegawa-sensei to you, lil brat, now get on your knees.&quot;

Lil brat. Who did this teacher thought she was? Why was she so cruel?
Why must people be so cruel to her? She thought she had escaped when
she left the Blue Star Jr. High; but it was a simple transfer.
Exchanging a corner of hell for another. Her thoughts were abruptly cut
as her teacher violently reached for her arm.

It hurt.

&quot;Miss Takega....&quot;

Her plead for mercy was abruptly cut. A stinging slap woke her up to
reality. She tried to defend herself; stand up, but it was useless.
Another slap and she was on the floor. Licking her lips, she could
clearly distinguish the taste of blood. Her own warm blood. Another
small protest was quickly subdued with more slaps.

Five piercing slaps; right on her beautiful face.

Her world quickly faded. When her senses returned; she began to wish
they had not. There she was; her arms being held by a rather strong
male student while she laid on the teacher&#39;s desk. The cold breeze
caressing her sensitive rear end told her that she was missing her
panties. A quick look confirmed this. Her skirt was pulled up and her
silky cotton panties were nowhere in sight. Behind her, miss Takegawa
addressed the students, who kept on laughing and making obscene remarks
during most of her little speech.

&quot;Look at her little pussy.&quot;

&quot;Oh God, I sure wish I can go next, wouldn&#39;t mind slapping that cute
ass.&quot;

&quot;Hope she sticks that kendo stick up her ass.&quot;

&quot;Wow, Panny, nice butt, bet your daddy has a lot of fun with ya.&quot;

Cruel.

Heartless.

Bastards.

The tears flowed freely from her closed eyes now. Her situation. She
did not deserved this. She did not deserved to be humiliated like this.
All she did was arrive late to the stupid class; it was not fair.

Not fair at all.

As miss Takegawa&#39;s speech subsided; Pan had a clear idea of her
intentions. She would be spanked. In front of the whole class. With a
kendo stick. Fifteen times. One spank for each minute she arrived late.
An apology slowly made it&#39;s way into her throat, but it was too late.
The first hit made her scream in pain.

It hurt so much.

Two.

Three.

Four.

Five.

Her screams seemed to be driving the heartless teacher mad. With each
new spank; Pan could feel her effort, her hate, her anger. This wasn&#39;t
punishment. This was revenge. Revenge against the world. And to her
soul-less teacher, she seemed to be the best representative of her
beloved blue planet.

Six.

Seven.

Eight.

Nine.

Ten.

In her mind, Pan counted each stinging hit. She knew she was screaming;
she knew she was crying; she knew she was begging. Begging for her
teacher to stop. To have mercy. But she didn&#39;t. She did not stop. She
kept on going.

Eleven.

Twelve.

Thirteen.

Fourteen.

Fifteen.

The last one. A sigh escaped her bruised, bleeding lips. She had bit
them in order to stop herself from screaming like a little girl. Her
sore butt was still screaming in pain; sending signals throughout her
nervous system to every part of her body. An explosive headache quickly
overtook her. Her vision was blurry and she could barely breath. She
knew her rear end was bleeding; the wounds inflicted by the kendo stick
being pretty severe. Slowly, she got off the desk and walked toward the
door, limping badly. No one stood up to help her. They just laughed.

&quot;Does it hurt, little girl.&quot;

&quot;Come here, lil Pan, let me lick those wounds for ya.&quot;

&quot;Bet her dad would lick them for her when she gets home.&quot;

&quot;Or the dog...&quot;

Damn them.

Damn them all to hell.

In her mind, she did not cared anymore; she just wanted to reach the
infirmary and then go home. Away from her stupid classmates; away from
her sadistic teacher; away from this miserable life. A voice suddenly
rang in her ears; making her stop.

&quot;I did not give you permission to leave my classroom; sit on your desk
right now; when the class is over, then you can leave.&quot;

What.

Was she serious. She sure couldn&#39;t expect her to sit on her desk and
wait for the class to be over. It was a two hour class, for crying out
loud. She would bleed to death in her stupid desk. Her mouth opened but
her voice was reduced to a mere whisper.


&quot;I told you to sit on the damn desk, right now. If I have to stand up,
the pain you are feeling right now will seem like nothing. I will make
sure you don&#39;t disobey me again, ever. You think you are better than
us, just because you are Son Gohan&#39;s daughter, well, you have another
thing coming, sit now, stupid bitch!&quot;

So that was it.

Her father. Son Gohan. Her stupid, over protective father; headmaster
of the Tokyo Institute of Science and Technology; a respected and
influential man all over Japan. He was, once again, the cause of all
her pain. Why must she be hated because of her stupid dad?

Why?

She barely nodded. Her strength had left her. As she headed for her
desk, she could barely distinguish the trail of blood that she was
leaving as she walked, barefooted through the cold floor. Sitting down
on the yellow chair behind her desk; her world once again faded into
nothingness. Incredible pain invaded her from all sides and she faded.
When she opened her eyes; only two minutes had passed. She cursed.

Just one more hour.

Looking down at her sit; she could see her warm, crimson blood dripping
to the floor. The smell was awful. She would bleed to death in here and
there was nothing she could do to stop it. Her fellow students choose
to ignore her and were busy, reading from their textbooks. Her teacher
hated her and would show no mercy. For some reason; she felt alone.

Alone and helpless.

The same way she had felt during most of her pathetic life.

Her situation kept on worsening. She couldn&#39;t move. Her voice had left
her. Her right eye was swollen and she could barely breath as her
wounds kept on shedding her life blood on the cold yellow chair.

So alone.

The sound of a voice; strange and yet so familiar momentarily took her
out of her lethargy. She couldn&#39;t move to look at it&#39;s source; but she
could listen. Listen to this beautiful voice that carried her name
among it&#39;s many syllables.

&quot;Takegawa-sensei; I request your permission to get the student Son Pan,
some medical attention. Her bleeding has not stop in the last five
minutes and I am afraid that she might die if she&#39;s not given the
proper medical care.&quot;

&quot;Permission denied, she will wait like everybody else. When the class
is over, then she can go to the infirmary; now sit before I decide to
send you to the principal&#39;s office.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me, Takegawa-sensei, but I must ask you kindly to reconsider my
request. Her wounds are severe and she needs medical attention.&quot;

Pan sighed. This girl. This girl that she did not even knew and whose
voice was so sweet and angelic, was challenging her sadistic teacher,
as she tried to get her the medical attention she so much needed. With
her head lying limp on her desk, she smiled.

&quot;Are you challenging me, lil brat, I&#39;ve had enough of this. I said
permission denied; now sit before I decide to punish you too.&quot;

&quot;You know, miss Takegawa; asking for your permission was a mere
formality. As elected president of this class, I can very much do
whatever the fuck I want and I will take her to the infirmary.&quot;

&quot;Over my dead body.&quot;

Pan&#39;s eyes suddenly shot open. The gasp coming from the mouth of each
and everyone of the students could not mean anything good. Using her
remaining strength, she looked at miss Takegawa&#39;s desk. The old teacher
was standing now; holding a bloody kendo stick as she headed toward her
desk.

No.

Not again.

Why?

Why does she hate me?

Why must she hurt me?

Her thoughts were interrupted. This new attack was merciless. She began
to hit her hard in the face with that bloody wooden stick. Over and
over and over again.

Five times.

Then it stopped. Pan was barely conscious. Her left eye was slowly
swelling. Blood emanated from numerous cuts scattered all over her
precious body. She couldn&#39;t hold it together anymore. Like a tree
falling on lonely woods, not making a sound; her bruised body felt limp
to the floor. She thought it would hurt.

But it didn&#39;t.

Safe.

Safe at last.

The pair of arms that held her body now felt so warm. She smiled as she
let herself go.

So safe and warm.

Sweet, angelic voice. I don&#39;t want to let go.

&quot;C&#39;mon, Panny, let&#39;s get you to the infirmary.&quot;

Strong, gentle arms holding her small body. Soft lips caressing her
battered forehead. Her bruised lips curved into a shy smile. For the
third time on that day, her world faded into nothingness. Only this
time, there was no pain, no suffering; only peace. She could now rest.

Peaceful rest.

Her last thoughts wandered over the limp body of her homeroom teacher;
lying unmoved on the bloody, tiled floor. Then nothing.

Please, stay with me, don&#39;t leave me alone.


*************


&quot;Finally, you are awake, Panny.&quot;

After four long hours of lying unconscious in one of the school
infirmary&#39;s cold steel beds, Son Pan finally awakened. Pain, her old
friend, quickly invaded her awakened senses. Trying to open her eyes
resulted in even more waves of pain invading her body. The soft caress
of a smooth, silky hand against her bruised face made her forget her
situation, her pain. Without even noticing, a small smile drew itself
on her wounded lips; a small smile directed at the young girl in front
of her.

Her savior.

Her new friend.

Her only friend.

&quot;That&#39;s my girl, are you feeling better.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot; her voice was barely a whisper. Her words were just lies. She
could still feel the incredible pain. Light headed, she felt her body
go limp once again. Slender arms were there to catch her.

&quot;Liar....you just rest here, I will get the nurse.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t leave.&quot;

What had she done. Those words. They flowed so naturally out of her
lips. Her arms moved, almost on their own; reaching for this girl.
Reaching for this girl she just meet; but that she felt as if she had
known for many years.

&quot;Please, don&#39;t leave me, stay with me....I....I need you, here....with
me....please, don&#39;t leave me alone.&quot;

The young class president gasped. Her eyes were fixed on the bruised
body of her classmate as she asked. No, begged for her to stay. Begged
for her to keep her company. Begged for her to not leave her alone. Her
movements became instinctive. Her arms reached for her. A hug followed.

A warm, loving hug.

Pan smiled.

So safe.

She could feel the other girl&#39;s hands as they administered sweet
caresses on her wild mane of black hair. Her eyes closed. The following
minutes were blurry in her mind. She must had felt asleep. As her eyes
barely opened; the picture of a generic doctor sticking a needle on
some redhead kid&#39;s butt caught her attention.

It was momentary.

Those beautiful hands; they were still caressing her hair. Her
situation seemed to have changed. She was now sitting on the girl&#39;s
lap. One arm around her waist; the other caressing her hair; soft
butterfly kisses placed skillfully all over her neck.

&quot;Back with the living, Panny?&quot;

Panny.

The pet name that both, her father and her mother, had chosen for her
since she was a little baby. A name full of so much love; coming out of
this beautiful girl&#39;s mouth.

Why.

&quot;Yeah....I...I think I am feeling better....thanks to you.&quot;

Was that a blush?

With only one eye barely opened, Pan could not distinguish. Was she
blushing. Yes, she was, she could see her clearly now. A small giggle
escaped her lips. She couldn&#39;t help it. She looked so cute; trying to
hide her face from Pan&#39;s bruised eyes.

&quot;Awww, c&#39;mon, what&#39;s so funny?&quot;

Pan just kept on giggling. With her swollen eye; she could see the
other girl smiling also. So cute.

&quot;I am sorry....it&#39;s just that....you look so cute when you blush.&quot;

&quot;What, awwww, c&#39;mon, I wasn&#39;t blushing, it&#39;s just that....it&#39;s hot in
here....geez, you thought I was blushing, c&#39;mon.&quot;

Their giggling slowly died. It was replaced by serious looks. Both
girl&#39;s faced each other. Pan couldn&#39;t help but to admire the beautiful
class president. So cute. So adorable. Barely 5 inches taller than her,
the blue haired girl was without a doubt, one of the prettiest girls
she had ever laid her eyes upon. Perfect face. Perfect body. Pretty
round breasts. Lovely blue hair. A real beauty. It did not struck her
as odd that she was admiring this girl&#39;s beauty. She was beautiful; why
couldn&#39;t she admire her.

&quot;So pretty...&quot;

&quot;Panny!&quot;

Another giggle. She wasn&#39;t thinking anymore. Having this girl, so
close, it was too much for her to handle. She saved her. She took care
of her. She was laughing with her. She was the first person to ever
show that she cared. In her life, no one had shown her that they cared
for her. She did not had any friends. On the Internet, she was a rebel,
a prankster, a hacker, hated by many. With her family, she wasn&#39;t even
happy; her parents always working, and not giving her any attention.
Only her grandpa Goku was there for her when she needed him. But this
girl....she cared about her. And Pan knew; that for the first time in
her short, miserable life, that she was in love. Just like that. She
was in love.

So in love with this beautiful stranger.

She couldn&#39;t help it. She tried to control herself. But it was useless.
Their lips meet. A kiss. The other girl&#39;s lips tensed. She almost
pushed her away.

Almost.

Without realizing, she kissed back. A kiss full of passion. When it was
over, Pan simply smiled. Her friend just sighed. Soon, a beautiful
smile illuminated her delicate lips too.

&quot;You know, Panny, we are kissing and all and we have not even been
formally introduced, my name is Bra, Bra Vegeta Briefs, nice meeting
you.&quot;

&quot;Pan98.....I mean....God....sorry, been so long since I&#39;ve done this in
real life....my name is Pan, Son Pan, and....it was nice meeting you
too.&quot;

A giggle escaped the blue haired girl&#39;s mouth. Pan 98. An online
nickname. Her laughter slowly subsided; being replaced by a more
serious look as the realization of why she introduced herself like that
sunk into her brain.

Pan 98.

Her online persona. She probably had no introduced herself to a real
person in years. Such a pretty girl; living such a lonely life. Without
thinking, she hugged her; holding the petite, black haired girl
tightly.

Closely

So close.

Pan did not pulled away. She did not even flinched. It felt so right,
so good, to be surrounded by those strong arms; to be so close to this
beautiful girl. Another kiss. A real kiss. Not a mistake like the other
one.

Her first real kiss.

So good.

So right.

So perfect.

&quot;I....I think I am falling in love with you, Bra Vegeta Briefs.&quot;

A small giggle. Not the response she was expecting. Raising her blurred
vision, her eyes met Bra&#39;s. The other girl smiled lovingly,
acknowledging the questioning look on her face. Her beautiful lips
caressed her forehead ever so lightly.

&quot;C&#39;mon, Panny, don&#39;t look at me like that....I mean, love is not
something that happens just like that....it takes time, getting to know
that special person....it may even take years before you find out if
you are in love with someone. Besides....I mean, God, we are both
girls, I....I don&#39;t mind really, but....oh man....I&#39;m lost....I am lost
for words, Panny, I don&#39;t want to hurt you and to be honest....I don&#39;t
know how I feel, I don&#39;t know what to say....it&#39;s just
that....love....it&#39;s not something that happens, it needs to be....I
don&#39;t know, constructed, takes time....so much time....so much tears.&quot;

Pan simply smiled. She was feeling better now. The pain was there; but
she had someone now. Her callous hand, product of many fights and
sparring sessions, reached for her new friend&#39;s smooth face, caressing
it tenderly. So beautiful.

&quot;It only takes a caress.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Love.&quot;

Only a caress.

Only a touch.

Only a kiss.

It was the only good thing her parents had taught her.

Love wasn&#39;t a complicated feeling. It was beautiful; the best feeling
in the world. It was wanting to be close to the object of your
affection. It was wanting to spend the rest of your life with that
person. It had no gender; no race; no age. Love was love. Pure and
perfect. It may take years to grow in your heart; or it may only take a
second; but once it grows, it will stay there forever.

&quot;Panny?&quot;

&quot;Love doesn&#39;t have to be complicated, Bra. It just happens. You have
been the first person to ever look at me without hate in her eyes. I
know what I feel....this feeling in my heart....I...I love ya, Bra. I
love you so much.&quot;

&quot;Panny.&quot;

Looking at the bruised face of this petite, black haired girl, who wore
a silly red bandada over her wild mane of hair; Bra was once again lost
for words. Her face was bloody; swollen; covered in many bandages; and
yet, without a shadow of a doubt, seeing her there, smiling like that,
she had to be the most beautiful thing her eyes had ever seen. Her
impulses dominated her actions. She kissed those swollen lips once
again.

Sweet kisses.

First real kisses.

Her life had been pathetic.

A life full of pretty boys who looked at her like an object. A life
full of lovers who did not respected her. A life full of fake smiles
and thousands of lies. Her eyes had shed so many tears. The most
popular girl in every town she visited. Boys making lines to have a
date with her. Virginity lost at the age of 12. Looking at this girl
that she just met, who just now, confessed that she was madly in love
with her, Bra couldn&#39;t help but to smile.

Happy.

This feeling in her heart. The very same feeling Pan was describing.
Butterflies in her stomach. Her heart beating so fast. Why did she
stood up and defended her? Why did she stayed with her in the
infirmary? Why did she let this girl kiss her? Why did she kissed back?
Why couldn&#39;t her hands stop caressing that beautiful, raven hair? It
was clear; so clear to her now.

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I love you, Panny....but I&#39;m sure as hell that I would
like to find out.&quot;

No more words.

Both girls simply hugged each other. Held each other so close. One kiss
after another; they let their feelings take control. Delicate lips
pressed against bruised lips. Kisses full of so much passion. Kisses
full of so much desire. Touches. Caresses. In so many ways; they
expressed their love for each other.

A new life.

A better life.

Together.

When Bra parked her aero car in front of the Son residence; Pan was
reluctant to let go. Ever since they left school, they&#39;d been holding
hands. Callous hands holding delicate fingers. Getting out of the car,
Pan smiled at the beautiful driver as she threw her book bag over her
shoulder.

&quot;Thanks for the ride; I don&#39;t think I would have been able to walk all
the way here.&quot;

&quot;No problem, Panny.&quot;

Turning off the car, Bra got out and stood next to her friend. Her arm
slowly found it&#39;s way around her slim waist; holding her closely. Pan
simply smiled; snuggling close to the object of her affection. Her new
friend. The girl she loved.

&quot;You coming to school tomorrow....I mean, the stupid bitch beat you up
so bad&quot;

&quot;To be honest, I don&#39;t know, Bra...I...I&#39;m scared....she hated me so
much without even knowing me....and the other students....their
comments....their laughter....I...&quot;

Slender fingers pressed against her lips kept her from going on. Her
right eye was swollen shut; but her left eye was slowly recovering.
Looking up; her friend was smiling. Such a beautiful smile.

&quot;Ssshh....not another word, Panny....you don&#39;t need to be
afraid....I....I will protect you, Panny, I will not let anyone hurt
you....ever....I don&#39;t want to see any more tears in those beautiful
eyes. I want to see you happy....I....I want to make you happy,
Panny....I want to be with you, and make you happy.&quot;

Their lips meet. This was goodbye. Both girls needed to get home. Sweet
kisses. Passionate kisses. Tongues dancing in an endless waltz. Sharing
their fluids. Sharing their very souls.

Wet kisses full of so much passion.

Bra smiled.

Pan waved.

&quot;See you at school tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;You bet....take care, Bra.&quot;

The aero car accelerated at top speed throughout the afternoon skies of
Satan City. Pan smiled. Opening the wooden door of the house she had
shared with her parents for 16 years; she noticed that they were
already home.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s a first.&quot;

The smile on her face never disappeared. Not even when she noticed the
shocked look on the face of her mother or the multiple curses of her
over protective father. His words ringed on deaf ears. Pan wasn&#39;t
there. She was with Bra. Hugging. Kissing. Smiling.

So good.

Empty words.

Empty threats.

&quot;What have you done?&quot;

&quot;Panny, listen to me!&quot;

&quot;Dammit, I am talking to you.&quot;

&quot;I did not raise you to be a fucking lesbian.&quot;

&quot;Pan!&quot;

Why bother.

Why listen.

They never cared about her.

Smiling, she kept on walking, oblivious to their threats. Not caring.
Not listening. To hell with them. For the first time in her life, she
felt happy. For the first time in her life, she felt complete.
&quot;I wonder if grandpa Goku is home; I can&#39;t wait to tell him about Bra,
bet he&#39;ll be so happy....&quot;

---

Ok, those are the fics. Can you tell I don&#39;t like the way Gohan and
Videl treat Pan. Anyway, g&#39;luck with the site and all, dude, laterz!
