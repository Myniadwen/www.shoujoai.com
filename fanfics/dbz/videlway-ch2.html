<h1>Videl's Way (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dbz/index.html">Dragonball Z</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../dbz/videlway-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The two walked out of the little house in the middle
of the Capsule Corporation complex, moving away from
the other buildings until they reached a clear patch
of grass. Videl took a nervous breath then called up
her power, her chi, then gasped in surprise as a spark
of power flared in one gem, bouncing to the other then
blazing around her as her chi surged.

&quot;Is everything all right?&quot; Bulma called out, shielding
her face from the dust, the air rushing by her as the
girl blazed brightly.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Videl beamed. The power died out almost as
soon as it appeared, Videl panting and breathless.
Still, there was a fire in her eyes, a passion that
hadn&#39;t been there only a short time ago. &quot;This is
going to take some practice,&quot; Videl looked up at Bulma
happily, &quot;but thank you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t thank me,&quot; Bulma put her hands in her white
labcoat pockets as she continued, &quot;it&#39;s going to take
you a lot of work to get the most out of them.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Videl said firmly, &quot;count on it.&quot;

Bulma watched a few moments later as Videl rose into
the sky, her aura already glowing slightly brighter as
she headed off to the next part of her plans. &quot;Good
luck,&quot; she murmured, &quot;though I doubt you&#39;re really
going to need it.&quot;

The little island was far from most of civilization,
in fact if you didn&#39;t have a very good idea exactly
where it was you&#39;d never be able to find it. The
little beach house looked comfortable, the palm trees
around it shading the porch where the man sat, smiling
slightly as he watched his wife and daughter playing
out in the surf.

The spark of golden light merely announced the arrival
of a power Krillin already sensed. The former monk
pushed his brown hair back as the young woman dropped
down onto the beach, walking up to the house with a
false casualness.

&quot;Hey Videl,&quot; Krillin said cheerfully, the Hawaiian
shirt and matching shorts he wore giving him a odd
resemblance to Master Roshi, &quot;what brings you by?&quot;

She settled delicately, her garb mostly black. A plain
muscle shirt, shorts and a jacket covered Videl
snugly, the sort of clothes that you might wear into a
fight. &quot;You got my message?&quot; Videl asked him calmly.

&quot;You sure about this? I never trained anyone before,&quot;
Krillin said.

&quot;You were trained under Master Roshi,&quot; Videl said,
&quot;who was once the strongest fighter in the world.&quot; She
flashed a smile as she continued, &quot;I&#39;m sure that I can
learn a lot from you.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Eighteen walked up to shoo the little girl into
the house then gazed with a thoughtful expression at
Videl, &quot;this is my new punching bag?&quot;

&quot;Eighteen,&quot; Krillin said proudly, &quot;will be your
sparing partner.&quot;

Eighteen pushed her short blonde hair up out of her
face, her athletic body shown off by the gesture as
she drawled, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I promise I won&#39;t do any
permanent damage.&quot;

Videl took a nervous breath as she looked between
Krillin and Eighteen then smiled bravely. &quot;I&#39;m ready
to start when you are,&quot; she said.

&quot;That&#39;s the spirit,&quot; Krillin went to slap her back but
the little man accidentally hit her right on the butt.

&quot;Watch the hands, love,&quot; Eighteen gave Videl an oddly
predatory look as she continued, &quot;this little cupcake
is mine.&quot;

&quot;Ah, right,&quot; Videl blinked.

The days on the beach were filled with combat, Krillin
demonstrating techniques that Videl would in turn try
to use against Eighteen. If she got it right,
Eighteen&#39;s mock attack would stop, if she got it wrong
Eighteen would remorselessly pound her into the floor.
If was a effective way to drive the lessons home, and
with each day Videl felt she was growing ever
stronger.

And her nights were filled by a entirely different
form of combat. The first night Eighteen had shown up
in her bedroom Videl had been surprised, even with all
the teasing that the sexy android had done during the
day. They had talked, that night, Eighteen quietly
expressing her interest then leaving, simply asking
Videl to think about it.

Videl did think, all that day, and in the evening she
had eagerly welcomed Eighteen into her bed. &quot;And
Krillin doesn&#39;t mind?&quot; Videl had whispered at one
point.

Eighteen just laughed softly. &quot;I love Krillin with all
my heart,&quot; she said gently, &quot;but we both know that he
can&#39;t give me everything that I need.&quot; She chuckled
softly, &quot;And you know, boys just love hearing about
this kind of thing.&quot;

Videl groaned, &quot;There&#39;s an entertaining thought.&quot;

Eighteen moved like a cat, positioning herself above
Videl as she looked down at her hungrily. &quot;You have a
lot to learn here, too,&quot; she purred right before she
pounced.

Leaving the island a few months later filled Videl
with regrets but she maintained a brave face. Krillin
had carefully put the patch on her jacket, the symbol
of the school he trained under and proudly said, &quot;I&#39;ve
taught you everything I know.&quot;

&quot;I doubt that,&quot; Eighteen smiled down at Krillin
fondly, making the man blush. She looked up at Videl,
&quot;You&#39;re always welcome to come back.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Videl said, honestly meaning it before
she continued, &quot;but I still want to try to develop my
skills even further.&quot;

&quot;Thought you&#39;d say that,&quot; Krillin said, passing her a
small notebook. He smiled as she opened it curiously,
&quot;Names and addresses of the other Z fighters, the ones
I know about anyway.&quot;

&quot;This... thank you,&quot; Videl bowed, the gesture filled
with respect. &quot;With this I&#39;m sure I can complete my
training,&quot; she murmured.

Krillin cautioned her, &quot;I can&#39;t promise you that
they&#39;ll all be willing to train you.&quot; He grinned, &quot;But
even challenging them will be educational.&quot;

&quot;Either way it works,&quot; Eighteen agreed, moving forward
to startle Videl with a firm hug. &quot;Come back some
time,&quot; she grinned, &quot;there&#39;s a few tricks I can still
show you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Videl agreed with a blush.

The two of them watched Videl rise up into the air,
soon disappearing off into the distance. &quot;Wonder if I
should have included Yamcha&#39;s name on that list?&quot;
Krillin mused.

&quot;They&#39;ll run into each other eventually,&quot; Eighteen
shrugged casually, &quot;better at a time and place of her
choosing.&quot;

It was over a year later that Bulma saw her return,
the black haired young woman dropping down onto the
grass outside of the Capsule Corporation buildings.
Videl looked different than when she had left,
confidence in her stance and a warm smile on her young
face.

&quot;So how did it go?&quot; Bulma asked, walking towards her
curiously.

Videl grinned back, &quot;I think I&#39;m ready, if that makes
sense.&quot;

&quot;And Gohan?&quot; Bulma raised an eyebrow, wondering how
she would respond.

&quot;I&#39;m going to go see him after this,&quot; Videl answered,
&quot;and let him know that he&#39;s my best friend... but
that&#39;s all that he is.&quot; Videl&#39;s cheeks went red as she
remembered some of the things she had done over the
past year, &quot;I have feelings for him, but I&#39;m not in
love.&quot;

Bulma looked impish as she took in the blush on
Videl&#39;s face. &quot;I guess you and Eighteen got better
aquatinted,&quot; she offered.

&quot;How did you know...&quot; Videl started only to trail off.
&quot;You, too?&quot; she smiled, giving Bulma a look that was
rather speculative.

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Bulma had a Cheshire cat grin on her face as
she continued, &quot;Maybe after you and Gohan get
reacquainted you can come back here?&quot;

Videl&#39;s voice had dropped to a warm purr, &quot;I think
I&#39;ll do that.&quot; With that she returned to the skies,
racing to a reunion she was rather looking forward to.

The house was as far from civilization as you could
get, something the small family living there honestly
appreciated. In his bedroom Gohan sighed softly, the
teen packing his school books away tiredly. It was
hard to put any effort into these things lately, it
all felt oddly pointless, somehow. He was setting them
up on a shelf when he felt it, an oddly familiar power
that was approaching the house at high speed.

&quot;Do you feel that?&quot; Chi-chi asked, his black haired
mother coming in to the room with a slight frown on
her beautiful face. She had been a martial artist
herself for many years, competing against his father
Gohan, and she had retained those skills over the
years.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;d better see who it is,&quot; Gohan agreed, going
past her to the front door.

The fighter was just touching down outside as he left
the house, the feeling of a dangerous power coming
from her. He didn&#39;t power up yet, not knowing what he
might be facing, then she turned towards him and he
felt his mouth drop open in surprise.

&quot;Hello Gohan,&quot; Videl smiled, and Gohan was shocked at
the power he felt coming off of her, the equal of any
of the Z fighters. The jacket that she wore carried
the names of many dojos and masters, including those
of both Tien and Krillin. &quot;Want to spar?&quot; she took up
her stance with a grin, the gems on her black gloves
gleaming.

End

Author&#39;s Note: I originally wanted to do a &#39;Videl
rebels&#39; story but she didn&#39;t seem to want to, somehow,
so instead you get this. I may or may not continue
this alternate Videl, as I&#39;ve had a few requests to do
a shoujo-ai story with her. This is set shortly after
the Buu saga and is based on how Videl is originally
portrayed in the series, not how she wimps out later
on.
