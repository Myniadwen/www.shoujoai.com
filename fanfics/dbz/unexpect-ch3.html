<a href="../dbz/unexpect-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The door opened and Bra found herself face to face with none other 
than Pan. Before Bra could say anything Pan spoke up.

&quot;Well you&#39;re all ready. Feel up to flying today?&quot; Pan seductively 
purred as she eyed Bra&#39;s body up and down. Bra thought about how 
wonderful the night before was, but again before she could say 
anything Pan went on ahead.

Pan quickly moved forward, and pushed Bra&#39;s body up against the wall. 
She pressed her lips up to Bra&#39;s and let her tongue explore her 
lover&#39;s mouth. Bra&#39;s breath was taken away, but she wanted more, so 
she wrapped her arms around Pan&#39;s neck and pulled the 1/4 Sayin toward 
her. Pan continued to kiss her with a passion, and as Bra started to 
return the kiss Pan squealed with delight. After a few more minutes of 
passion Pan pulled away. Bra was about to say something, but then Pan 
wisped right into Bra&#39;s ear.

&quot;We should continue this someplace more private, don&#39;t you agree?&quot; Bra 
nodded, and Pan slowly walked out the door.

&quot;Just follow me. It&#39;s all of what I told you on the phone this 
morning, and more!!&quot; Bra was about to smile, but suddenly she got 
scared. Pan started to light up, her hair started to shake, and she 
transformed into a Super Sayin. Of course! Bra knew that both Pan and 
her were Sayins, but in the heat of the moment she momentarily forget. 
Unfortunately, however, Bra knew she had a very big problem now. 
Having spent such a short time in a Sayin body, Bra was sure that she 
did not know how to transform into a Super Sayin. If Pan ever found 
out who she really was spending her time with, she was sure that the 
dark hared Sayin would be very angry. 

&quot;Come on,&quot; Pan said from her hovering position in the clouds. &quot;I&#39;m 
starting to miss you...&quot; Bra tried to power up. She felt the Super 
Sayin energy pent up deep inside her, but she did not know how to 
release it. She concentrated harder, trying to release all the energy. 
But she did not feel any different.

Then Bra remembered all of the episodes of Dragon Ball Z she watched, 
back when she was Tom. She remembered that when all of the other 
characters went Super Sayin, they all were extremely emotional over 
something, but that emotion was usually anger. Bra did not feel any 
anger then.

Pan slowly lowered herself down to the ground. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; she said 
with only a slight touch of sadness in her voice. &quot;I just thought that 
today might be the day you finally go Super Sayin. I know how 
important a step this is for you, but I really am happy with you 
transforming in your own time. Really.&quot; Bra was very relieved. If she 
had never gone Super Sayin before, Pan would not suspect anything. 

&quot;Besides,&quot; Pan said, starting to cheer up. &quot;I love when I get to carry 
you. It&#39;s so romantic don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;Uh huh...&quot; Bra said quietly, suddenly and unexplainably shy.

&quot; &#39;Uh huh&#39;?&quot; Pan mimicked Bra&#39;s shaky voice, causing the blue haired 
Sayin to let out a slight giggle. &quot;Well I guess you just don&#39;t 
remember our last trip together.&quot; Pan smiled and reached out her 
glowing hand, but even while the look on her face seemed happy, Bra 
could tell that Pan was somehow inwardly disappointed. 

&quot;Did I say something wrong?&quot; Bra wondered to herself as Pan picked her 
up in the spoon position and started to fly up. As Pan started to move 
faster, Bra felt a rush of power. Bra could feel that not only was Pan 
physically lifting her, she was also using some of her energy to keep 
her in the air as well, and that some of it was washing off on her. 

As the couple soared towards the clouds, Bra had a stroke of genius, 
the kind many freelance authors like herself (or more accurately, like 
her former self. Bra had no idea what she did for a living in this 
world.) often have. She thought about the power, about Pan hiding her 
disappointment in her failure to go Super Sayin, and about how many of 
the characters could talk to each other over great distances in the 
DBZ show. Bra used her power to try to create a telepathic link to the 
one person who would know about this sort of thing: Vegeta.

&quot;Dad?&quot; Bra felt very strange calling Vegeta by this name, but he was 
her father and he would expect nothing else. &quot;Dad? Can you here me?&quot;

&quot;What is it Bra? Are you in trouble?&quot; Bra heard no words, but 
experienced the knowledge that Vegeta was talking to her, almost as if 
telepathy was nothing more than invisible, long range sign language. 

&quot;No Dad I just had a question about Sayins. When a male Sayin goes 
Super Sayin, the transformation is triggered by extreme anger, right?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right Bra. I first went Super Sayin out of anger that I wasted 
3 years training to become a Super Sayin without achieving it. The 
anger of my own failure was enough to make me transform.&quot;

&quot;But what makes a female Sayin go Super Sayin?&quot; Bra thought as Pan 
kept flying over the clouds. Bra could see from the expression on 
Pan&#39;s face that, lucky for her, Pan had not been able to detect her 
conversation with Vegeta.

&quot;Bra, I wish I had a real answer for that question. The only Sayins 
ever to go Super Sayin besides the great Super Sayin of fable were 
your brother, Kakorot, his sons, and me. All males. There is only one 
folklore that suggests that females follow a different path, but many 
on our planet believed that it was a fool&#39;s story.&quot;

&quot;Please tell me...&quot; Bra mentally pleaded.

&quot;Well, alright, but I wish I didn&#39;t have to. It&#39;s sort of a poem 
legend and you know I hate poetry. But I will recite it for you, but 
ONLY because it&#39;s short.&quot;

Women do not thrive on pain,
To them life is a different gain.
Love and kindness are her drink,
With affection her eyes must blink.
To go on her heart must know,
True love and then her hair will glow.

&quot;So that&#39;s why I was disappointing! Love! I haven&#39;t shown my love 
yet!&quot; But just as the thoughts left her brain Bra realized she had 
made a terrible mistake. She had forgotten Vegeta could still hear her 
thoughts.

&quot;So Kakorot told Goten that story too? Honestly Bra, if he is 
disappointed with you because you didn&#39;t go Super Sayin over him you 
should leave him right now. I always thought it was wrong for you to 
see someone so much older than you are! When are you going to give him 
up?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll think about dumping him, OK? Gotta Go. Bye.&quot; This time, Bra 
tried not to think too much as she mentally disconnected herself from 
Vegeta. 

&quot;So Bra used a relationship with Goten as a cover for her time spent 
with Pan.&quot; Bra thought about it some more. &quot;What could he have been 
getting out of it?&quot; Then Bra thought of something that really puzzled 
her. &quot;Pan went Super Sayin out of her love for me, but I did not do 
the same for her. Maybe Bra doesn&#39;t really love Pan after all.&quot;


After another 20 minutes or so Pan landed on a green meadow, and the 
two girls lay down and looked at the clouds together for a few 
minutes. 

&quot;This is great, but this isn&#39;t what I wanted to show you. Follow me.&quot; 
Pan led Bra over the west side of the meadow, though a path into a 
cave. Pan guided Bra though the darkness by holding hands, and at the 
end of the tunnel was a huge waterfall. 

&quot;Do you like it?&quot; Pan whispered. The waterfall was loud, but somehow 
Bra could hear her perfectly. 

&quot;It&#39;s very romantic.&quot; Bra said. Inwardly, Bra thought, &quot;That is the 
first time I have ever been able to say that and not be lying.&quot;

Pan looked a little surprised. &quot;I thought you said the outdoors wasn&#39;t 
romantic. I just brought you here because I wanted to show you, I 
didn&#39;t think you would feel the same way I did about it.&quot;

Bra looked into Pan&#39;s eyes. &quot;Any place is romantic as long as you are 
with me.&quot; Bra DID think the waterfall was romantic, but she could not 
resist saying what seemed to force its way out.

Pan started to blush (she looked so cute!) and the two stared into 
each other&#39;s eyes. As they sat there, gazing at each other, Bra&#39;s mind 
slowly came to realize what her cautious part of her brain had tried 
to hide her from. Pan was the most beautiful woman she had ever seen, 
and she was hopelessly in love. Bra tried to make her lips form the 
words as she stared into those big, deep, beautiful eyes.

&quot;I love you, Pan.&quot;

&quot;I love you too, Bra.&quot; The two Sayin girls slowly moved their faces 
toward each other, and they both experienced the both romantic kiss of 
their lives. It was so soft, so gentle, and yet so full of passion at 
the same time.

But the kiss what not all Bra felt. Right as her lips locked with 
Pan&#39;s she felt a strange sensation filling up inside her. As Pan&#39;s 
tongue entered her mouth the feeling grew stronger. As the kiss went 
on, the wonderful feeling spread out to her whole body. Bra lost 
control, as she arched her back stiff, threw her head back and started 
to yell. Pan gripped on to her lover, planting kisses on her exposed 
neck. The energy surge ended with a loud scream, and Pan looked up at 
Bra with pure love and happiness in her eyes. 

Pan jumped up and kissed Bra with a passion. She stopped and gleefully 
yelled: &quot;You did it! You love me! Oh I love you so much too Bra!&quot; Bra 
saw that she was floating and that her hair had turned yellow. She had 
transformed into a Super Sayin. 

Bra slowly lowered herself to the ground and smiled. &quot;Based on what 
happened last night, I would say that it&#39;s my turn.&quot; Bra slowly pulled 
down Pan&#39;s spandex pants, while Pan started panting in delight and 
anticipation. Bra then used her newfound strength to tear Pan&#39;s 
halter-top open, causing a small gasp from Pan. The dark haired Sayin 
slowly undid her bra, revealing her large, rounded breasts. Bra began 
to slowly lick on her right nipple, and she heard Pan&#39;s breathing 
begin to quicken. Bra started to then suck on the nipple and she felt 
it going hard in her mouth. As Pan started to moan with pleasure, she 
stopped sucking and moved her tongue down her lover&#39;s naked body. Bra 
had no idea what to do, but she let instinct do the work as she 
started press her mouth on Pan&#39;s waiting womanhood. Pan moved her hips 
forward as Bra fully extended her tongue, causing Pan to scream with 
pleasure. Bra licked again, and she could feel that her mate was close 
to climaxing. Bra began to lick more quickly, and Pan started bucking 
her hips erratically while screaming out in ecstasy. Pan&#39;s womanhood 
tightened on Bra&#39;s tongue as she let out a scream louder than the one 
that Bra had let out earlier. 

Bra licked up the sweet fluid from her lover&#39;s garden, and she could 
still her Pan panting with pleasure. The dark haired Sayin, exhausted 
from the desire, started to fall forward. Bra was not quite quick 
enough to catch her, as she crashed on top Bra&#39;s body. Pan looked up 
at Bra and whispered, &quot;I love you&quot; before laying her head down on 
Bra&#39;s breasts and drifting off to sleep. 

Bra looked down at her sleeping Sayin lover, and wondered how a first 
date could possibly end up this good. She slowly lay her head down on 
the cave path, and listened to the sound of the waterfall as she fell 
asleep. </pre>
