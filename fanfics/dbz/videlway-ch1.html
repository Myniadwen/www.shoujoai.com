<h1>Videl's Way (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dbz/index.html">Dragonball Z</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was quiet there, standing out in the middle of the
grass covered plain. The untamed wilderness stretched
out all around them, with scraggly trees growing not
far away and the sounds of wild animals off in the
distance. A gentle breeze stirred the tall grasses,
ruffling the hair of the two opponents who were facing
each other.

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Gohan asked seriously, his scruffy
black hair pointed upward in that distinctive style
that he always wore.

Videl didn&#39;t answer aloud, instead the girl just
kicked upwards, the black haired fighter&#39;s body a blur
as she moved gracefully in her simple overshirt and
leotard. Gohan blocked and struck outward, then they
were off. The fight almost became a dance, each of
them flowing from one stance to another with a speed
that most would consider to be inhuman.

&#39;I&#39;ve got to move faster,&#39; Videl thought to herself
bleakly, knowing that her opponent was still holding
back against her.

Gohan had a determined expression on his face, the
handsome young man&#39;s fighting stance giving every
indication that he was putting his all into the fight.
But Videl had seen him battle during the Buu contests,
saw the devastating power that he could call up so
easily and she knew that he wasn&#39;t going anywhere near
his limits.

&#39;And I&#39;m barely keeping up,&#39; Videl thought. Distracted
by her thoughts she moaned as a fist clipped the side
of her face, blood sent trickling down into her eyes.

&quot;Enough,&quot; Gohan called even as he stepped back.

Videl faked a kick at his head even as she scowled,
&quot;Keep going!&quot; She raced forward, throwing punches but
Gohan just blocked and dodged, backing away.

Gohan caught her hands in his, restraining her with
frightening ease as he said to her hesitantly, &quot;But
you&#39;re bleeding....&quot;

Videl pulled free angrily then reached up to wipe the
blood away with the back of her hand, straightening up
to show that the pain wasn&#39;t bothering her. She sighed
as she asked him, &quot;And has that ever slowed you down?&quot;

&quot;Well, no,&quot; Gohan admitted, &quot;but I&#39;m....&quot; He trailed
off, seeing the peeved expression on her face. &quot;What&#39;s
wrong?&quot; he asked.

Videl felt a flash of anger, one that she worked hard
to contain. &quot;I&#39;m a fighter Gohan,&quot; she explained to
him patiently, &quot;just like you and the others.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Gohan raised his hands in surrender. He took
up his stance with clear reluctance as he said, &quot;Do
you want to continue?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Videl shook her head, knowing it was a waste of
time. She looked at him, this warm, kind young man
whom she had come to know, who was her best friend. &#39;I
just wish that I felt more for him,&#39; she thought
regretfully, wishing she didn&#39;t have to do what she
planned.

&quot;What?&quot; Gohan blinked.

&quot;Gohan,&quot; Videl looked at that open, honest face sadly
as she said, &quot;I don&#39;t think we should see each other
anymore.&quot; Gohan looked at her with an expression of
honest confusion and she sighed, &#39;this is going to
take some explaining.&#39;

Videl looked up, watching him disappearing into the
afternoon sky. It was almost irritating, how good
naturedly he had taken it all. &#39;Not that I&#39;m entirely
sure he understood,&#39; she thought to herself tiredly.
She rose into the air, wobbling a bit as she thought
with a flash of irritation, &#39;Could he really not have
figured out we were dating?&#39;

The ground streamed by beneath Videl as she soared on,
enjoying the feel the air whistling by her. She smiled
wryly, feeling the honest pleasure of this gift, the
best present that Gohan had ever given her. &#39;And the
only one,&#39; she thought.

The grasses soon gave way to rock, then desert sands
blew around her as she let herself drop, coming down
to rest on a simple stone tower. Short black hair fell
into her eyes as she sat down on the warm stone,
crossing her legs under her as she looked up at the
blue sky, watching the white clouds drift by on the
shockingly blue sky.

&quot;So what do I do now?&quot; Videl muttered.

She had always wanted to be the best fighter in the
world, to live up to her father&#39;s legacy. Videl smiled
to herself wryly, &#39;Not that Hercule was what all that
he claimed to be.&#39; Still, she had developed her
physical strength, her fighting power, and for a time
she had thought that she was at least the second best
to her father.

&quot;Then I met Gohan,&quot; Videl muttered to herself as she
lay flat on her back, cushioning her head with her
arms.

His first appearance as the Gold Fighter with his
superhuman power, then &#39;Great Sayaman&#39; and eventually
meeting all the other Z fighters had just driven the
point home. Her father wasn&#39;t the world&#39;s strongest,
he had just been lucky that they hadn&#39;t chosen to
compete against him. And his supposed victory over the
deadly warrior Cell? He may have been there, but Videl
doubted that Hercule had played any major role there.

Videl didn&#39;t feel any anger for him, didn&#39;t even
resent the deception that her father had carried out
to the world. What she resented was her own inability,
her complete lack of power. Working with Gohan showed
her she merely had a shadow of the sort of power that
he had, and even mastering flight under his training
hadn&#39;t really helped.

&#39;I may be able to use the sort of power that the other
Z fighters do,&#39; Videl thought, &#39;but I can&#39;t really do
anything with the little bit that I have.&#39; She sat up,
closing her eyes for a moment as she mused, &#39;I want to
compete on their level, I want to be able to find my
own power.&#39; Videl sighed softly, &#39;But I can&#39;t do that,
not the way I am.&#39;

Videl rose to her feet, her stance casual, but there
was a feeling of power all around her. The dust motes
flew around her as she rose up into the air, hovering
there a moment as she felt that simple realization
come over her.

&quot;Then I guess I&#39;ll have to try and become something
else,&quot; Videl concluded, soaring off with a destination
clearly in mind.

Bulma opened up the door, looking at Videl with a wry
smile on the blue haired woman&#39;s face, seemingly
unsurprised at seeing her at her door. &quot;Gohan called
me,&quot; she explained as she waved Videl in, &quot;he was
worried about you.&quot;

Videl raised her eyebrows and followed her in as she
said, &quot;I wonder if he called all our friends or if he
guessed I&#39;d be coming here?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t underestimate Gohan&#39;s intelligence,&quot; Bulma
scolded.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Videl asked as she was sent to a seat at the
kitchen table and Bulma got them some healthy fruit
drinks from the fridge.

Bulma looked amused as she said, &quot;Gohan can be kind of
dumb emotionally, but other than that he&#39;s pretty
sharp.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Videl didn&#39;t sound terribly convinced as she
sat down, Bulma sitting just across from her. &quot;Are you
all alone here?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Baby Trunks is here,&quot; Bulma smiled to herself fondly,
&quot;but Vegeta has taken off on another one of his
training journeys again.&quot;

&quot;It must get lonely,&quot; Videl murmured, thinking back to
all the times her father had left back when she was a
little girl.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Bulma looked impish as she drawled, &quot;I
always have my, ahem, muscle massager to keep me
company.&quot;

It took Videl a moment to figure that out, then the
girl blushed brightly under the clearly amused woman&#39;s
gaze. &quot;I wanted to ask you something,&quot; the dark haired
girl quickly changed the subject to the reason that
she had come there, &quot;is there any way that a normal
fighter can reach the sort of power levels a Z fighter
can?&quot;

&quot;A normal fighter,&quot; Bulma took a drink from her cold
cup of juice as she continued on gravely, &quot;meaning
you.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Videl admitted.

&quot;No way,&quot; Bulma shook her head regretfully.

&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Videl protested, &quot;a suit of battle
armor, maybe?&quot;

&quot;Whatever you gained in strength enhancement you&#39;d
loose in speed and maneuverability,&quot; Bulma said,
&quot;they&#39;d take you apart.&quot;

&quot;Cybernetic enhancements, like the androids,&quot; Videl
offered up the idea, looking across the table at Bulma
intensely.

&quot;You&#39;d really go that far?&quot; Bulma raised delicate
eyebrows, a bit surprised.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Videl admitted.

&quot;Yamcha came to me for help a while back,&quot; Bulma said
softly, &quot;he&#39;s a Z fighter, but he was never able to...
ascend, in the same way that the others have. His
powers never grew, he never pushed himself in the same
way the others did.&quot;

&quot;And he wanted you to enhance him,&quot; Videl said softly.

&quot;For what had once been between us I tried my best,&quot;
Bulma softly said, &quot;and failed. The only thing that I
could give him wasn&#39;t enough for him, he still would
have had to work hard for any possible increase in his
power.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Videl blinked, wondering for a moment what had
once been between Bulma and the former bandit. She
stopped, something Bulma had said fully registering
and asked her &quot;So what did you come up with for him?&quot;

Bulma walked over to a dresser, pulling open a drawer
and digging around inside while muttering comments
under her breath as she came across various things
like, &quot;Oh there&#39;s where I put the dragon radar.&quot;
Finally she pulled out a pair of gloves and tossed
them to Videl and said, &quot;Here.&quot;

The black gloves were fingerless, the synthetic cloth
glossy in the kitchen lights. On the back of each was
a clear crystal, held onto the gloves by a simple
golden ring. &quot;What are they?&quot; Videl asked, a bit
hesitant to pull them on.

&quot;Chi resonators,&quot; Bulma explained.

Videl blinked as she blurted, &quot;You can manipulate that
energy scientifically?&quot;

&quot;It impacts the physical world,&quot; Bulma shrugged, &quot;so a
scientist should be able to study it.&quot; She took on a
lecturing tone as she nodded to the gloves, &quot;By
manifesting a chi field the gloves will amplify the
effect, giving you more energy to draw on. Eventually,
you&#39;d be able to generate that greater power level
entirely naturally.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;d have to train hard to keep that power,&quot;
Videl mused, &quot;as well as to continue to grow in power,
right?&quot; Bulma nodded her agreement as Videl slipped
the gloves on, tightening straps on her wrists till
they fit. &quot;Not bad,&quot; Videl murmured.

&quot;Don&#39;t try them out until you go outside,&quot; Bulma
quickly cautioned her, having some experience with the
girl&#39;s impatience.

&quot;Oh, right,&quot; Videl looked a little sheepish, &quot;sorry.&quot;
