<h1>Unexpected Changes (part 8 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dbz/index.html">Dragonball Z</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yurifan.html">Yuri Fan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../dbz/unexpect-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>It had been 8 weeks since that night at the club, and so far Bra and 
Pan had managed to keep their parents from finding out. But lesbianism 
wasn&#39;t the only thing they had to hide. They also had to hide the fact 
that Bra wasn&#39;t really Bra. Today they had decided to go see Dendae 
for advice. Dendae was an A-sexual, like all of the members from his 
race, making him (in the hopeful minds of Bra and Pan anyway) more 
tolerant.

Pan and Bra instant transmitted to the top of the lookout. &quot;Uh, 
Dendae?&quot; Pan was a little nervous. Dendae was about to be the first 
person she told her little story to. &quot;Um, can we ask your advice on 
something?&quot; 

&quot;Sure, why not. Anything for the granddaughter of Goku. He saved my 
people, and I owe him a huge debt.&quot; Dendae looked a little lonely, 
like he didn&#39;t get too many visitors, which was probably true.

&quot;Dendae, Bra and I have a couple of secrets that our parents don&#39;t 
know about. We have to tell them eventually, but we were wondering how 
we should do it.&quot; Dendae did not ask what the secret was. He simply 
his right hand on Bra&#39;s forehead, and his left hand on Pan&#39;s forehead.

After a few seconds Dendae&#39;s brow began to furrow. Then he started to 
shake. He quickly pulled his hands back.

&quot;Uh, I, um, I didn&#39;t know it was this kind of secret...boy Vegeta is 
probably gonna kill you...&quot; Pan did not know how much of the secret 
Dendae had revealed with his mind reading, but then he added, &quot;Tom.&quot;

Bra gulped. Perhaps having the real Bra talk to Vegeta first would be 
best...

&quot;From what I have heard, relationships like yours are usually 
considered embarrassing to the parent, wrong, unholy and disgusting. 
If my little Thursdae ever wanted to abandon our people&#39;s way of 
A-sexual reproduction, I would be very mad.&quot; Pan knew that Dendae&#39;s 
child would grow up being an outcast, but she seriously doubted 
something like that would ever happen.

&quot;If you two actually plan on telling your parents about this, you 
better prepare yourselves. I guarantee they will try to split you up.&quot; 
Dendae looked at Bra. &quot;You have a much more serious problem. Tying to 
get Vegeta to understand that his child is possessed by a man&#39;s 
spirit...you really are doomed. Wait.&quot; Dendae looked very thoughtful.

&quot;I&#39;ve got it! I know what you can do! Tell your parents that you are 
in love with Tom, but an unfortunate accident caused him to switch 
bodies with Bra! Both of your parents will be satisfied, right?&quot; Bra 
seemed to like this solution. It was very close to the truth, and 
Vegeta was not likely to kill her. But Pan did not look happy.

&quot;I like Dendae&#39;s idea, Pan! What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Pan looked even sadder.

&quot;Don&#39;t you see!?! It&#39;s a lie! My parents have the right to know the 
truth about our relationship!&quot; Pan could see that Bra was not 
convinced.

&quot;Think about the real Bra, Pan. Having to tell Vegeta that she made 
the switch voluntarily puts her in a very awkward position. Besides, 
do you really think that either of our parents would accept us? They 
might never speak to us again!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right about Bra. She did a lot for us by burning that diary. 
We owe it to her. But we should ask. As crazy as it may sound, she may 
want to tell her dad.&quot; Just then Dendae fell to the floor. As he 
started to get up, a large flash of light engulfed him, and a blonde 
woman fell from the sky. Bra though she could almost hear the word 
&quot;Trapped&quot; being spoken very quietly, but it might have been just her 
imagination. 

&quot;Amber? How did you get here?&quot; Bra was the only person who recognized 
her. All Amber was wearing was a large, smoking lump of cloth that 
looked like it used to be a dress of some kind. 

Amber looked up at Bra. &quot;How do you know my name?&quot;

&quot;Long story Amber. Would you be by any chance looking for a man named 
Tom?&quot; If Amber had sent herself to this world the same why the real 
Bra did, Tom was probably why.

&quot;Yes! Yes I am! Could either of you to, um, use that car thing for 
me?&quot; Pan looked very confused, but Bra knew what she was talking 
about.

&quot;Instant transmission. Yes, I can use it for you.&quot; Pan waved goodbye 
to Dendae, and the three teleported to a large room, where Dinocaps 
were being made. 

The three women saw Tom working in an assembly line, slowly putting 
the tops on the Dinocaps. Amber rushed over to Tom, and hugged him 
tight.

&quot;Oh Tom! I tried to get over you so hard, but I just couldn&#39;t! Then I 
used your computer and found out why you accidentally left, and then I 
did the exact same thing you did! I hope you don&#39;t mind, but I kinda 
set fire to your house...I love you, Tom!&quot; 

Tom was speechless. This was too good to be true, a miracle. The bell 
for lunch sounded, and Tom slowly kissed Amber.

After a good five minutes of kissing, Bra and Pan got the idea that 
they should wait a little to ask Tom about Vegeta. When they came back 
at nine o&#39;clock, Amber was no longer at the factory. Tom walked up 
them. &quot;I owe you both a huge favor. Nothing this wonderful could ever 
be repaid in money, but I have an idea. I know that by now you must be 
very nervous about telling your parents about your relationship, 
tonight. I will tell Vegeta everything for you.&quot;

&quot;Do you have any idea how angry he could be??? That is suicide!&quot; Bra 
could not believe this. 

&quot;I asked Amber to marry me. No matter how angry Vegeta is, he has to 
know that his daughter is going to get married. Besides, of the four 
of us, he is the least likely to kill me. I AM his daughter, after 
all.&quot;

Both Bra and Pan could see that there was no convincing Tom. &quot;Thank 
you, Bra. It will be easier if our families here it from somebody else 
first. Less shock. Don&#39;t you agree, Pan?&quot; Bra looked at Pan, who 
seemed very deep in thought.

&quot;I guess it would be best. I&#39;m not sure that I would have the courage 
to tell my parents about me, anyway. If Vegeta tells them, it will 
probably be better.&quot; Pan and Bra both thanked Tom again, and 
disappeared. Spending the night in Pan&#39;s apartment was probably best 
for tonight. Bra had heard (and experienced) that after couples have 
been together for over 2 months, times start to wind down, and the 
romance becomes less exiting. Many times, couples even start not 
liking sex as much as they used to.

But this was not the case for Bra and Pan. If anything, it seemed like 
their life together was a never-ending upward spiral. They never got 
tired of spending all of their time together, and the bedroom 
activities...well, if anybody said that the sex was starting to wind 
down, they would have to be deaf, blind, and unconscious.

Pan started to kiss Bra with a passion, and they both forgot their 
parental worries...

Bra and Pan awoke at the same time. Bra found that Pan had fallen 
asleep on top of her again, which happened often. Both girls found 
this very sexy, and Bra never had to worry about getting any bruises 
due to her Sayin skin.

Normally the girls would have spent at least another hour in bed 
together before getting dressed, but they wanted to know how Vegeta 
took the news about them. So they got dressed immediately, then tore 
their clothes off, then spent another hour in bed together, then they 
got dressed.

Bra and Pan agreed to see Vegeta first. The instant transmitted to 
him, and found that he was already waiting for them. 

&quot;Well I was wondering when you two would show up. My real daughter 
already told me everything. You,&quot; Vegeta pointed to Bra, &quot;I have 
nothing to say to. I don&#39;t know you, and what you did was only an 
accident, and then it was Bra&#39;s wish. I am not angry with you. But 
you,&quot; Vegeta pointed at Pan, &quot;You think that it is OK to sleep with my 
daughter without my permission? If it weren&#39;t for the fact that your 
uncle can go Super Sayin 6, I would kill you where you stand. But, as 
it is, I will just have to hope that you did not take advantage of her 
sexual ignorance to spark a relationship.&quot; Pan shook her head, with 
fear in her eyes. 

&quot;Bra had feelings for me long before I had feelings for her Vegeta. I 
did not take advantage of her in any way.&quot; Vegeta smirked. 

&quot;I find that very hard to believe, but for my own sake, I have to. I 
already told Gohan and Videl about you, and believe me, my reception 
will seem warm compared to what they have in store for you.&quot; Pan 
looked very shocked. Perhaps Tom did not do the right thing after 
all...

&quot;Do you want to wait until tomorrow to talk to them, Pan?&quot; Bra was not 
sure she was ready for this.

&quot;I think it would be best if I got it over with, Bra.&quot; Pan and Bra 
said goodbye to Vegeta, and then instant transmitted to Gohan and 
Videl&#39;s house.

Gohan and Videl were sitting on a sofa in the middle of the room that 
Bra and Pan appeared in. Both of them had very serious faces.

&quot;Pan, I only want to ask you one question. You had Tom. You had the 
man you loved. How could you have made him choose to be a woman like 
that? If you really were in love, you would not have cared. Why 
couldn&#39;t you accept Tom for who he was?&quot; Videl&#39;s question seemed like 
an unanswerable one, but Bra spoke up.

&quot;Pan did not tell me to do it. It was my choice. I wanted her to be 
happy.&quot; But Videl was not satisfied. &quot;But Pan, why couldn&#39;t you just 
have loved Tom for Tom? Why did you have to make him change for love?&quot; 
This time Pan was ready.

&quot;If it was me in Bra&#39;s place I would have done it too. I could not 
change who was, but Tom could. Tom loved me and he respected me. He 
knew that I was who I was, though and though. Aren&#39;t you even happy 
that I&#39;m in love?&quot;
Gohan looked at Pan. &quot;This is just very hard for us to accept dear. We 
are happy that you are in love, but we think you might just be a 
little confused. Why not try seeing some more guys before you commit 
to something like this?&quot; Pan could feel tears in her eyes.

&quot;This isn&#39;t some kind of experiment or fling! This is me, this is who 
I am! I am not messing around, I&#39;m in love! Can&#39;t you see that?&quot; Pan 
was trying her best to hold back tears.

&quot;I don&#39;t think you know what you are saying, dear. I know Bra is 
pretty, but that doesn&#39;t automatically equal...&quot; Videl&#39;s comment was 
cut short. Bra powered up to a Super Sayin and started to scream.

&quot;I AM NOT GOING TO CHANGE! IF YOU TWO CAN&#39;T ACCEPT ME, THEN I WILL 
LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT MY PARENTS!&quot;

Gohan acted like he had been expecting a breakdown like this all 
along. &quot;Dear, we didn&#39;t mean to upset you, we only want you to 
understand that what you call love really is...&quot;

Pan could not take it anymore. She instant transmitted out of the 
house. Bra looked up at the bad parents.

&quot;I do have the mind of a male, you do know that. Shouldn&#39;t that bring 
you some comfort?&quot; Videl shook her head. 

&quot;Our daughter is just confused...&quot; Bra cut Videl off mid sentence.

&quot;No she&#39;s not. If I were you I would start working on trying to accept 
her for the woman she is. She is old enough to think for herself. I 
have nothing more to say to you.&quot;

And Bra disappeared as well.
