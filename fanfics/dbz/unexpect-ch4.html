<h1>Unexpected Changes (part 4 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dbz/index.html">Dragonball Z</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yurifan.html">Yuri Fan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../dbz/unexpect-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The first surprise Bra had when she woke up was that she was still 
Bra. She remembered that the first time she had fallen asleep in the 
DBZ world she had gone back to her original body. Bra wasn&#39;t quite 
sure if she was happy about the prospect of never being in her own 
body again, but one look down at the dark haired girl sleeping on her 
chest made her to forget all her worries. Just watching Pan sleep was 
enough to make Bra happy.


Meanwhile, in a different universe...

Amber awoke with somewhat of a start. She had dreamt of a far away 
land, of a cave, a waterfall... but before she could remember anything 
else it seemed to fade away from her memory. All she seemed to recall 
was that she was slightly disturbed at seeing whatever she saw, but 
she could remember nothing.

She turned her head and looked at her sleeping lover, Tom. She giggled 
as he stirred in his sleep. She loved his body, but what she loved 
most of all was his passion. When he started to kiss her, she felt 
immobilized with passion, frozen in ecstasy. She always let him take 
complete control. She knew she was lucky that they both liked the 
arrangement better that way. 

Tom, finally awake, looked up into his window, only to see the sun 
framed face of his blonde haired lover. Amber was so beautiful, so 
feminine, and so perfect. He loved the way she was so gentle, so 
sweet. But Tom had not forgotten his true identity. He forced himself 
to look away. He knew that this was the second time that he had 
cheated on Pan. He knew, back when he was Bra, that there always was 
something missing in his relationship with Pan. That was why only Pan 
transformed into a Super Sayin on their first night, and he did not. 

Amber rolled her heavenly body on top of him. &quot;It&#39;s Saturday,&quot; Amber 
said with a coo. &quot;No job for you to go to today. Maybe we can just lie 
here all day and make love.&quot; Tom tried very hard to say no, to talk 
about Pan, to say he was really a girl, but all of these failed him.

&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot; Tom said. He quickly sat up, grabbing Amber by 
the arms. She let out a small cry of surprise, but by then he was 
already pushing her back up against the headboard of his bed. He 
leaned into her body, his bare chest touching her naked, voluptuous 
breasts. As they started to kiss, all thoughts of Pan left his mind.


As the two human lovers kissed, two golden lights emerged from the 
cave from Amber&#39;s dreams. As the two flew side by side, Bra thought 
only of flight itself. 

&quot;This is incredible. I feel a little guilty about taking Bra&#39;s first 
flight away from her, but it was me who got her this far in the first 
place. But what a rush!&quot; Bra felt as if she had so much power inside, 
she could never spend it all. But after a few minutes of following 
Pan, the serious portion of her mind took over. Many mysteries about 
her new life here had been solved last night, but Bra knew that unless 
all the mysteries about this DBZ land were unveiled, she could not 
relax. 

She remembered realizing yesterday that Goten had pretended to go out 
with her, in order for her to have more time to spend with Pan. But 
she had not figured out what Goten was getting out of the deal. She 
would have to find a creative way of bringing it up without letting 
Goten realize that she had forgot.

&quot;Goten, Goten, can you hear me?&quot; Bra tried to use telepathy the way 
she did yesterday. It seemed to work, as she heard Goten&#39;s voice 
almost immediately.

&quot;I&#39;m here Bra. I found another Dragon Ball last night. Thanks for 
telling everybody you are seeing me again. If anyone ever found out 
what I planned to wish for, I would be in big trouble.&quot; Bra thought of 
the perfect excuse to ask her question.

&quot;Goten, Pan knows. She told me about it yesterday. She said she would 
not tell anybody as long as she got to hear what you wanted to wish 
for. What should I do?&quot;

&quot;Hmm. Just tell her it&#39;s for more power. Don&#39;t say it is to be better 
that your brother. That would put her in an awkward position. I have 
having to cheat like this, but I love Soo-Soo, and she said that she 
would marry whoever won the upcoming World Martial Arts tournament. 
Trunks is the only Sayin competing besides me, so if I have more power 
than he does I am sure to win!&quot;

&quot;Okay, bye Goten.&quot; It had worked perfectly. So Goten had wanted to 
become more powerful than Trunks... She sighed. That really didn&#39;t 
help her at all. She still had no idea why she had come here 
originally, or when she would leave again. 
Pan suddenly stopped moving forward, and Bra moved toward her. &quot;We are 
up in the clouds,&quot; Pan said seductively. &quot;Nobody will see us...&quot; Pan 
was wearing a blanket, thanks to the fact that Bra had torn her top in 
a moment of passion, a fact neither girl regretted. She slowly took it 
off and tossed it to Bra as the girl moved forward. Bra licked a line 
down Pan&#39;s breast, intentionally avoiding her nipple. As Pan cried out 
from the tease, Bra put her mouth on the breast bud, gently sucking on 
it like the night before. Bra knew that Pan liked this very much and 
began to suck harder, feeling the nipple grow hard in her mouth. Bra 
moved her hands to her lover&#39;s womanhood, and gently massaged it. 
After she had brought her as close to climaxing as she could go 
without actually causing her underwear to soak, the pleasure stopped. 
Bra knew it was best that Pan&#39;s parents not see her with any 
embarrassing wet spots anywhere. After looking at each other for quite 
some time, Pan spoke up reluctantly.

&quot;Bra, I have to go home, my parents are expecting me. I want to see 
you tonight though OK? Meet me at our meadow.&quot; Bra suddenly realized 
that without a guide, she would have no way of going home. She was 
about to look for Pan, but she was gone. Bra started to look for her 
house. As she thought about it, she saw only black for a second, and 
then she was back home. 

&quot;Instant transmission.&quot; Bra said out loud, looking at her bed. For the 
first time she saw something funny. A brown book was sticking out from 
under her pillow. The words written on it were: My Diary. But Bra 
remembered putting the diary in the closet, just the morning before. 
Then she thought about the situation some more. The diary entry was on 
the first page of the other book, so maybe this was Bra&#39;s old diary. 
She looked through it, and finally had the answer to her most 
important question.

April 29. Dear Diary, I feel so sad today. So much is missing from my 
life. I wish I could just be magically whisked away to a different 
world, where all of my problems didn&#39;t exist.

Bra now knew the system. Every time she read something about another 
world, even through a pillow, she switched bodies. That is why she had 
stayed in her body last night: They never were on Bra&#39;s pillow.

Bra had no idea why she felt so sure of this explanation, but she felt 
deep down that this was it. She didn&#39;t know how, but she trusted her 
intuition and its strange ways. She walked out of her room and noticed 
a note on the door.

Dear Bra, out shopping, we will be back, TrunksVegetaBulma

&quot;How sweet&quot; Bra thought sarcastically. She slowly walked outside, and 
thought about how wonderful the night before was. She was truly happy, 
and she could not remember ever having been before. Not only that, but 
she made someone else happy. She was both loved and in love. She lay 
down on the grass, and smiled up at the clouds.


&quot;Oh yes! Oh yes!&quot; Amber let out a loud scream, and both her and Tom 
climaxed together. Tom looked Amber in the eye, and the blonde haired 
girl stared back at him, grinning like an idiot. The very satisfied 
girl had never felt such passion in her life. She only hoped that Tom 
felt the same way she did. Tom, however, had bigger things on his 
mind. As he looked down at his mate, he remembered the long talks 
(followed by the long nights of lovemaking of course) he had with her. 
She seemed so right for him, so fit. He wanted to never go back to 
being Bra, to be Tom and be with Amber forever. He looked at Amber 
again, who was still heavily panting. 

&quot;I love you Amber&quot;

Amber could not contain herself. She let out a sigh, pulled herself up 
against Tom. She kissed his neck, and started to breathe even faster.

&quot;I love you to Tom&quot; Amber barely managed to say between gasps and 
kisses. Tom squeezed Amber close, and pulled her face up to his. Their 
lips slowly touched, and the lasts drops of doubt Tom had melted away. 

Hours later, while Amber was in the shower, Tom sat down at the 
computer. He saw a strange story written, which seemed to be his life 
as Bra before he realized his feelings for Pan. Tom, eager for an 
explanation, pressed a button on the page in order to view the 
introduction. 

As his eyes read the text, Tom suddenly knew both how and why he was 
in his body. Tom sat up, knowing what he had to do.
