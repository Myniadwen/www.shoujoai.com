<h1>Unexpected Changes (part 5 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dbz/index.html">Dragonball Z</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yurifan.html">Yuri Fan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../dbz/unexpect-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Tom sat down at the computer. It had been eight days since he 
discovered the secret of the documents, and why he had moved into this 
new world. The introduction warned that any story in the site would 
allow the reader to be transported into the world of the story, but 
any time a story was read about a &#39;New World&quot;, the reader would switch 
back. However, Bra read at the bottom: &quot;BEWARE! IF YOU DESTROY THE 
STORY, YOU WILL BE FOREVER TRAPPED IN THE OTHER WORLD WITH NO WAY TO 
GO BACK.&quot;

Tom knew that he had to burn the document if he wanted to stay with 
Amber, but he was not sure that he was ready to make this kind of 
decision. He loved Amber, but to spend the rest of his life in a 
strange body on a strange world? Tom pretty much knew that he was 
going to stay. He had given it plenty enough time. He knew he had to 
act. 

In another world...

Pan looked up at Bra from the table. &quot;Your eyes&quot; she said out loud. 
&quot;They have something so wonderful in them, so...gentle, so sweet.&quot;

&quot;It must be transforming into a Super Sayin, that might have changed 
them.&quot; Bra said a little nervously. If Pan was beginning to guess...

&quot;No, it&#39;s not that. I remember. I noticed the look in your eyes that 
night a little over a week ago. That was the day before you went Super 
Sayin, remember?&quot; Bra could not believe it. She had pinpointed the 
exact time Tom had entered Bra&#39;s body.

&quot;You changed then. Something happened to you. These past nine days 
have been different. Somehow, you have become sweeter, more loving. 
It&#39;s as if your heart has finally came out of its shell.&quot; Bra was too 
shocked by this compliment to say anything. Not only did she have the 
love of Pan, but Pan loved her too. Not her as in Bra, but as in Tom, 
the real person she was.

&quot;I see something in your eyes too Pan. I really have never felt this 
way about anybody, ever. Just being around you makes me want to cry 
with happiness.&quot; Bra meant how she felt. Finding Pan was the best 
thing that had ever happened to her. And to think, just 10 days ago 
she would have said she preferred Bra!

Pan was about to say something, but just then the moonlit dinner was 
interrupted. A large flash of light lit up the air, and Bra was flung 
up into the sky. This particular romantic dinner, like the others that 
had come before it that week, had been perfect. Perfect up until now, 
that is. 

Pan gasped as Bra rose higher in the air. A second flash of light lit 
up the sky, and a dark figure seemed to appear next to Bra. The two 
figures slowly drifted to the ground, and Pan thought she could her a 
voice say, &quot;Trapped...&quot;

The dark figure next to Bra was the first to rise to his feet. 

&quot;Pan?&quot; he called out. &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Who are you and how do you know my name!&quot; The dark haired Sayin was 
both confused and angry.

&quot;Why am I at our secret place, Pan? What&#39;s going on! I&#39;m not supposed 
to be here, I&#39;m supposed to be there! The story said...&quot; Bra was 
rudely interrupted by Tom&#39;s loud voice.

&quot;WHAT DID YOU DO BRA? WHAT DID YOU DO TO THE STORY??&quot; Tom could not 
stand it. Why was he back in his old body again? And why was Bra here? 
Just when he thought he had figured things out...she goes and messes 
with the system? Why?

&quot;I...uh, I burned it, um, Tom. Wait. You&#39;re Tom? Then who am I?&quot; Bra 
looked down to see herself in her old body again. She moaned in 
despair as she sobbed. &quot;How could this have happened? I wanted just 
the opposite!&quot;

Pan looked at the two with suspicion. &quot;Care to clue me in on what&#39;s 
going on here? Either of you?&quot;

Tom, not hearing Pan at all, shouted, &quot;You BURNED IT! What possible 
explanation was there! I saw your life! I read you diary! You were 
happy there!&quot;

&quot;I wanted to stay. The directions said that if you burned the story 
that I would be forever stuck in the other world.&quot; Bra seemed very 
disturbed by this new chain of events.

&quot;Bra! It&#39;s me who is stuck here now! This is my other world, you know. 
I was the first one who read it, so those directions were about my 
fate!&quot;

&quot;ACHEM&quot; Pan cleared her throat loudly. She needed to know what was 
going on, now.

&quot;Pan, it&#39;s like this. 9 days ago this guy over here started reading 
this story about me. Then the next thing you know, we switch bodies! I 
got to go to his universe and be Tom, and he got to be in this 
universe and be me. But I messed up, and now we are both stuck in this 
universe, in our original bodies.&quot; Pan looked as if she was about to 
burst out laughing.

&quot;Come on you guys, were did you get that, a sci-fi movie? There is no 
such thing as body switching or alternate universes!&quot;

&quot;You know it&#39;s true Pan. It&#39;s been me these last nine days. Look into 
my eyes.&quot; Pan looked into the eyes of the tall, dark haired man. She 
saw something, something deep...

&quot;Now look in Bra&#39;s eyes. Was that the Bra you were talking to just 10 
minutes ago?&quot; Pan looked intently into Bra&#39;s eyes. When she looked 
back at Tom she just said, &quot;It&#39;s a funny tick of the moonlight that&#39;s 
all. Bra&#39;s eyes look a little different, but it will take more than 
that to convince me.&quot;

&quot;Ask Bra to go Super Sayin.&quot; Tom said. Bra shouted, &quot;WHAT! I CAN GO 
SUPER SAYIN! THE POEM YOU TOLD ME! BUT I NEVER...&quot;

&quot;Go Super Sayin Bra. Prove this guy wrong. Show your love for me.&quot; Bra 
looked back at Pan. &quot;I told you, I never went Super Sayin for you. I 
don&#39;t know how.&quot;

Pan looked at Tom again. &quot;I don&#39;t find this game of Bra&#39;s amusing. You 
haven&#39;t convinced me...&quot; Tom grabbed the girl and looked into her 
eyes. At first she started to pull away. Her Sayin strength was about 
to make her succeed, but then her eyes met with Tom&#39;s. As she stared 
into them, she knew that nobody could know that stare but her true 
love. 

&quot;So it&#39;s true...you really are the one I&#39;m in love with, and who loves 
me in return.&quot; Pan looked at Bra with tears in her eyes. &quot;You tried to 
leave this world forever? You tried to leave me?&quot;

&quot;I...I...&quot; Bra could not say anything. She put her hand on Pan&#39;s neck. 
Pan arched her shoulder back and slapped her in the face. 

&quot;Leave me alone, Bra. You don&#39;t love me, you never really did.&quot; Bra 
started to say something, but she just instant transmitted somewhere 
instead. 

&quot;As for you...normally I would be furious at somebody sleeping with me 
without me knowing about it. But we love each other. I hope you know 
what this means now.&quot; Tom looked up at Pan.

&quot;I understand. You can&#39;t love me. You never could. I would not ask you 
to do something like that. You are a lesbian, and I respect you.&quot;

Pan just looked up into Tom&#39;s eyes and nodded. Then she leaned over 
Tom&#39;s shoulder and cried. &quot;I do love you,&quot; she whispered, &quot;but I can&#39;t 
change who I am. I could never bring myself to kiss a boy. I&#39;m glad 
you understand.&quot; Tom felt tears seeping down his face as well. He had 
wanted his old body back before, but he could not have the woman he 
loved with it. 

&quot;Still friends Pan?&quot; Tom whispered, as it began to rain.

&quot;Still friends Bra.&quot; Both of them had become so used to the 
relationship, and both were so in love with each other, that neither 
of them realized Pan had used the wrong name.
