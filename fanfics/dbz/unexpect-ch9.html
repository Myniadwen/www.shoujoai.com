<h1>Unexpected Changes (part 9 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dbz/index.html">Dragonball Z</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yurifan.html">Yuri Fan</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../dbz/unexpect-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>After two weeks of living hell for Pan, her parents finally agreed to 
have a second talk with her. They said that Bra should not come 
because that would be easier for everyone. So Bra waited outside while 
Pan and her parents talked.

Bra was hoping it would go well. He knew how much Pan valued her 
parents. Bra had also started giving some thought to the future. 

She knew that she wanted to propose to Pan, but she wasn&#39;t sure how. 
Would she get a ring, would Pan get a ring, would Pan be offended if 
Bra just made the decision on her own, would it ruin the romance if 
Bra asked her... There was too much to worry about. And that was just 
the beginning.

Bra had thought about the wedding itself. Who would take whose name? 
Would they get a hyphen? What would they wear? She knew that she would 
feel very funny if Pan wore a tux. And although Bra had spent almost 3 
months in a girl&#39;s body, she wasn&#39;t sure that she wanted to get 
married in a dress, either. But if Bra wore a tux and Pan wore a 
dress...that really wouldn&#39;t depict their relationship at all. Pan was 
just as dominant as Bra was, and probably more so. Having Pan be the 
&quot;prize&quot; in a dress didn&#39;t hold true to who Pan was. 

Sufficed to say, Bra was very conflicted. It would be so much easier 
if Pan made all of these decisions. But even if Pan did, there really 
didn&#39;t seem to be any way for the wedding to be perfect. She decided 
to contact Vegeta. Maybe he could help.

&quot;Vegeta, Vegeta, can you hear me?&quot; Vegeta answered immediately.

&quot;Yes Tom, I can. What do you need?&quot; It was only natural for Vegeta to 
call Bra Tom. His real daughter was somebody else.

&quot;I&#39;m thinking about asking Pan to marry me, but I&#39;m not sure what to 
do for the wedding. Maybe we could have some kind of Sayin wedding?&quot; 
Bra was going out on a limb, but sometimes the craziest ideas are the 
best.

&quot;Well, considering you two are the only Sayins ever to marry each 
other on this planet, I guess it might be fitting for you to observe 
the Sayin wedding rituals...but it is very funny that you asked that 
question.&quot;

&quot;Why is it funny Vegeta?&quot;

&quot;Well...my real daughter asked me the same exact question this 
morning...even though she already decided to have a human wedding. I 
guess she was just curious. She seemed interested when I told her the 
ritual.&quot;

&quot;What exactly does it involve?&quot; Vegeta hesitated, but he did answer.

&quot;Well...I guess I can tell you if you really plan to marry a 
Sayin...and you are a Sayin too sort of...what happens first is all of 
the friends and family get together and form a circle around the two 
people getting married. They can&#39;t get married just anywhere; they 
have to get married in a place of special significance and love. The 
guests have clothes on, but the bride, and um, well in your case the 
bride and bride have to come naked. Then the bride and, um bride tell 
each tell a story to each other about a particularly fond memory. Then 
they wrap their tails around their bodies, hold each other close, and 
kiss. Then the Sayin Wedding ritual is complete.&quot; Bra thought that it 
was a romantic way to get married. Not only that, but it solved a lot 
of her decision problems. It was a little weird, but after changing 
bodies with a Dragon Ball Z character 3 times and becoming a girl, 
weirdness didn&#39;t seem to matter anymore.

&quot;What about name changing? How would that work for us?&quot; 

&quot;Well, in Sayin weddings, the name is kept the same. I took Bulma&#39;s 
last name, but in a Sayin wedding, you both keep your name the same.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Vegeta...I&#39;m not sure if Pan would like it, but thanks. Maybe 
when we get married, we will honor the old traditions.&quot; 

Vegeta almost sounded happy. &quot;Well I&#39;m glad one Sayin might do it. 
When Bulma and I got married she insisted on the human way. When 
Kakorot and his wife got married, they didn&#39;t know he was a Sayin. 
When Kakorot&#39;s son and Videl got married, they both were too attached 
to their human upbringing to listen to my advice.&quot;

Bra could see Pan starting to de-materialize in front of her. &quot;Thanks 
Vegeta. Talk to you soon.&quot;

Pan was smiling. Not a devilish smile, but a content one. &quot;They said 
they will respect my choice. They admitted that they were wrong 
before.&quot; Pan hugged Bra close. 

&quot;I&#39;m so happy for you Pan. It&#39;s a cause for celebration!&quot; Pan nodded 
in agreement, then whispered in Bra&#39;s ear.

&quot;Bra, let&#39;s go someplace special tonight.&quot;

They ended up going to a very expensive restaurant. Normally a place 
like this would be far too expensive to go to, but the owner knew how 
many times Goku had saved the world, so he let Pan and anybody she 
came with eat free. But even if he didn&#39;t, Pan would still be able to 
pay with ease due to her newfound tournament wealth. 

Bra had thought it over on the flight there, and the had decided that 
tonight would be the night that she asked Pan to marry her. It seemed 
like the right time.

Bra could not concentrate on what she ordered. They were both too 
young to drink alcohol (Pan was 20 and Bra was 19), but Bra felt as if 
she had 10 glasses of champagne.

Pan looked a little distracted as well. When the two Sayins talked, 
they stuttered, slurred words, and repeated themselves. Bra decided 
that her nervousness must be spilling over into Pan.

After the uncomfortable dinner, Pan suggested taking a walk on the 
beach. When they arrived, they could just see the beginning of a 
sunset. 

They took off their shoes, and walked barefoot in the sand. The ocean 
seemed red, reflecting off the sky. The gentle waves seemed to be 
keeping the beat to a song only the sea could hear.

Bra and Pan walked together, not saying a word. Soon, the sunset was 
over, and night was upon them. By this time they had walked out to a 
very secluded part of the beach. Pan told Bra that her family owned 
this area, and that it was very private.

Fortunately, it was a new moon that night. Transforming into a giant 
monster is not exactly the most romantic thing to do on the night you 
are proposing.

Soon it was almost midnight, but the sky was not dark. They were far 
from the city and it&#39;s smog, and so they could see by the light of the 
stars.

Pan and Bra stopped walking, and turned to face one another. Bra could 
see Pan glow in the starlight. Her long, flowing black hair seemed to 
be as beautiful as the night sky. Pan nervously smiled, her full lips 
becoming more tantalizing. Bra brought her gaze slightly downwards. 
She was dumbfounded that she used to describe her body as &quot;not 
perfect&quot;. She did not know if it was love, but somehow she could not 
imagine a body being any better. All around, she was a slightly 
smaller girl than Bra, but she was just as big where it mattered. She 
loved how Pan kissed, with so much passion. She loved that feeling of 
almost not being able to breathe, when Pan put her tongue even deeper 
into her mouth...that feeling the best in the world... 

Pan was looking at Bra with similar admiration. Her long, blue hair 
went all the way down her back. The color matched the color of her 
lips, which were very cold. Her lips...they were so kissable...so 
sweet. Bra&#39;s perfectly rounded face framed them so well.
And Bra&#39;s body was to die for. It was the kind overwhelmed you, the 
kind that robbed you of all thoughts except those involving holding 
her close. She remembered all the nights of holding her down and 
kissing her...that was the best feeling on earth. The feeling of that 
wonderful body pressed up against her, that sensation when she 
explored Bra&#39;s mouth...

Bra took a deep breath. She knew that she would not find a better 
moment. She started to open her mouth.

&quot;Bra, will you marry me?&quot; Bra could not believe it! All of this 
nervousness...and Pan had the exact same idea!

Bra was beyond thinking now. Not realizing that she still hadn&#39;t 
answered Pan&#39;s question, Bra slowly leaned towards Pan. 

The two rosy cheeked lovers felt their lips meet, and were lost in 
love. As they kissed, both of them could feel tears move down their 
cheeks from happiness. 

After a few minutes of gentle, heavenly kissing, Bra finally spoke up.

&quot;I would love to marry you, Pan. In fact I was going to ask you 
tonight.&quot; Bra wondered if she should bring up Sayin weddings, but once 
again Pan beat her to the punch.

&quot;I&#39;ve been asking, Tom, well really Bra, but you know...Well I&#39;ve been 
asking him to talk to Vegeta for me. About weddings. You see, I 
thought that considering this is the first Sayin-Sayin wedding on this 
planet, we might honor the old rituals. And I thought it would make 
things easier in terms of who wears a dress and stuff. I can tell you 
about it, and you can see if you like it. I thought that it was 
romantic...&quot;

&quot;Pan, I&#39;ve been talking to Vegeta about Sayin weddings too. I would 
love to have one.&quot; Pan lit up like a firefly.

&quot;Oh really! I&#39;m so happy! I though you wouldn&#39;t like it you know 
growing up as a human and all! I&#39;m so glad!&quot;

&quot;Pan, you&#39;re forgetting that I grew up loving this universe, wishing I 
was here every night...&quot; But the time for words was over. 

Pan put her lips up against her fianc&eacute;&#39;s, unable to contain her 
emotions any longer. She kissed Bra hard, causing the blue haired girl 
to lose her balance.

The two Sayins fell onto the sand, feeling the waves kiss their 
ankles. They slowly got up, and remembered this was a private beach.

Pan and Bra slowly took their tops off. Then they undid each other&#39;s 
bras, and took each other&#39;s pants and underwear off. Pan put her arms 
around Bra&#39;s neck, and pulled her close. They started to kiss again.

Pan could feel her breasts pressed up against Bra&#39;s. As Pan pulled her 
arms tighter around Bra, she could feel their nipples brushing up 
against each other. Pan pushed her tongue deeper in Bra&#39;s mouth, and 
held Bra&#39;s body even closer.

After a few minutes, Pan began to explore Bra&#39;s mouth even deeper than 
ever, sliding her entire tongue into Bra&#39;s mouth. Bra was unable to 
breathe at this immense pleasure, and felt her nipples grow hard. Pan 
felt it too, and squealed as Bra&#39;s hard breast buds pushed against her 
own.

Pan slowly ended the kiss, and Bra gasped for air, her head spinning 
with passion. Pan slowly lay down on the sand, and Bra lay on top of 
her, licking her neck.

Bra moved her tongue down Pan&#39;s voluptuous body, stopping at her 
breasts. She waited a couple of seconds, and then began to suck on 
Pan&#39;s right nipple like an infant.

Pan loudly moaned as Bra slowly sucked. Bra began to suck harder, and 
felt the nipple grow hard in her mouth. 

Pan screamed with pleasure, thinking that if it were possible foreplay 
alone would climax her. Bra switched to the left nipple, and made that 
one hard too. 

Bra slowly stopped sucking. Normally, foreplay didn&#39;t last this long, 
but they both were enjoying it much more than usual tonight. &quot;No...&quot; 
Pan said. &quot;More...I need more...&quot; Bra obeyed and continued to suck on 
Pan&#39;s breast, and Pan screamed in pleasure.

After 15 minutes of this, Pan felt it was time for her to repay the 
favor. She kissed Bra&#39;s forehead, causing Bra to stop sucking and look 
up. Pan quickly pushed the younger girl down. Bra let her head fall 
back on the sand, and Pan got on top of her.

Pan slowly pushed her arms under Bra&#39;s torso, slightly elevating Bra&#39;s 
head and neck. She stated to give Bra a hickey on her favorite area, 
which was right where the neck ended and just before the collarbone 
started.

Bra started to moan as Pan sucked harder. Bra slowly snuck her fingers 
under Pan&#39;s stomach and let them brush her wet garden. 

Pan was caught completely by surprise. She felt a great, animal-like 
pleasure build up inside her. She pushed her hips down on Bra&#39;s, and 
slowly growled. 

As much as she had enjoyed the sensation, Pan wasn&#39;t about to let Bra 
catch her off guard again. The dark haired girl pinned her lover&#39;s 
arms down with her own, and moved her head down.

Pan put her tongue down on Bra&#39;s slightly disproportionate breasts. 
For a thin girl, Bra was packing two very generous scoops of vanilla. 

Pan began to lick a tiny circle on Bra&#39;s left nipple, teasing her. 
Eventually Pan gently bit down, producing a squeal from Bra. Soon, Pan 
began to very, very slowly suck on the breast bud.

Bra loudly moaned at the gentle sucking. As Pan began to suck harder, 
Bra started clenching and unclenching her fingers in rhythm with Pan&#39;s 
mouth.

Bra screamed loudly and started rocking her hips, feeling herself get 
warmer and wetter. Pan put her whole mouth over the nipple, and 
finished sucking it. By this time, it was very hard.

Bra started to move her hands towards Pan&#39;s womanhood again, but Pan 
wanted to try something different tonight. Pan slowly stood up, 
placing her feet on top of Bra&#39;s. Then she let herself fall backwards, 
with their toes touching the whole time.

Bra did not see Pan&#39;s plan, but she would very soon. Pan told her to 
roll on her side, and lift one leg into the air.

Bra did as she was instructed, still not understanding Pan&#39;s secret 
agenda. Then Pan spread her own legs, and used her arms to slide 
towards Bra. Bra could feel Pan&#39;s butt on her foot.

Then Pan moved closer to Bra. Their two open legs met at the center, 
and they cried out in passion.

Pan pushed forward again, causing their two womanhoods to get even 
closer. Bra could feel her clitoris rub against Pan&#39;s causing them 
both to scream. 

They pushed forwards again and again, causing loud screams each time. 
Surprisingly, Pan climaxed first. She usually held out longer than 
Bra, and had had her breasts sucked first. But perhaps Pan was just so 
exited, she could not hold it in any longer.

She let out a loud scream, and Bra could feel Pan&#39;s warm juices flow 
on her legs and garden. But Pan was aware that Bra had not been 
satisfied yet. She was about to lick her fluids off of her, but then 
an unusually large wave covered them both, washing the sweet honey 
away.

&quot;Darn&quot; Pan said while pouting. &quot;Yours is better but still....&quot; Bra 
shook her head.

&quot;No, Pan. Yours is the best. Mine flavor isn&#39;t half as good.&quot; They 
both looked at each other, and thought how sweet it was that each of 
them preferred each other&#39;s juices. They walked 20 feet inland before 
resuming their activities.

Pan pushed Bra down kicking and flailing. All resistance ceased as Pan 
started to kiss. It was gentle at first. Their lips brushed together, 
their tongue&#39;s licked their lips. Then it became passionate. Bra 
explored Pan&#39;s mouth, but they soon found out that they both liked it 
a lot better the other way around. 

Pan&#39;s tongue, which was bigger than Bra&#39;s pushed deep into the blue 
haired Sayin&#39;s mouth. Bra could hear Pan say &quot;Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm&quot; 
under her breath.

Pan loved the taste of Bra&#39;s mouth, she pushed deeper, exploring Bra&#39;s 
mouth in places she didn&#39;t know she had.

Finally, Pan took it to the level that both girls liked it best at. 
Pan pushed her entire tongue into Bra&#39;s mouth, taking the younger 
girl&#39;s breath away.

Bra, barely able to breathe, could feel Pan&#39;s tongue dominating her 
mouth. She could feel Pans body on top of her, which was now slowly 
moving up and down. She could smell Pan&#39;s scent, and all of her senses 
blurred together. It was the best kiss ever. Bra could feel all things 
leave her mind, except one thought. One single message to the woman 
who had made her cursed life into a perfect one.

Pan was loving it as much as Bra was. Her whole tongue tasted Bra&#39;s 
wonderful sweet mouth. She loved the feeling of holding Bra&#39;s warm, 
soft, tender, curvy body close. She could feel all of her mate&#39;s body 
under her, and she started to move her hips harder. As she held the 
beautiful woman close, taking her all in, loving her, pressing her 
body down on her...only one thought remained in her head, one thought 
dedicated to Bra.

The single thought resounded in the heads of the two lovers, the match 
made in heaven, the couple that crossed parents, sexuality, and a 
universe to be with each other. Pan had the best friend she had grown 
to love, and the soul of someone who had made the ultimate sacrifice 
for her. Bra had universe she had grown to love, and the girl who she 
never expected to fall for.

The single thought ran though them from that moment on, stretching out 
towards infinity. Their lives were perfect, and it was all they could 
think.

&quot;I love you&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

And that is then end to Unexpected Changes. I hope you liked it. 
Depending on the feedback, I may write a sequel to show their wedding 
and their married life. I am thinking of writing original fan fiction 
romance, set in a fantasy universe, at PG-13 level.

Please review this story! Tell me what I did that was good, and tell 
me what I did that was bad! If you want to chat or tell me something 
more detailed then can be posted in an interview, feel free to email 
me! I love getting email!
