The dinner table was quiet that evening as the Bebop crew exchanged 
uneasy glances. Ed was so happy she couldn&#39;t eat.

&quot; So, Faye and Julia are a couple, Spike and- &quot; *shudder* &quot; Vicious 
are a couple, and Ed and someone equally crazy are an item. You guys 
are all weird, &quot; Jet said cleaning his plate.

&quot; Oh yeah? And what about you?&quot; Faye countered.

&quot;...Would it kill you if I said me and Ein are engaged?&quot;

The only sound after that revelation was the running water and the 
happy tune coming from Ed. Another book for the Bebop crew was just 
finished.

------------------------------------------------------------
 
My God, this has to be the most weirdest Cowboy Bebop fic ever 
written. It&#39;s a happy ending in a crazy way. So whether you loved it 
or hated it, at least I got a reaction out of you lovely people.
