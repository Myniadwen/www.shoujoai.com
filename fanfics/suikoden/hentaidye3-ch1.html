<h1>Understanding, Part 3</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../suikoden/index.html">Suikoden</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hentaidye.html">Hentai-Dye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Most likely as a result of the environment in which I was raised, I&#39;ve never
really understood the dwellings of the Grasslander tribes, particularly not
those of the Karayans. This isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t like them, naturally. I do
think them interesting and pleasant places, and there is a certain exotic
quality to them that I have never quite been able to shake my liking of
(despite my society&#39;s best efforts). I still have trouble imagining living
within them permanently, though. And perhaps my status as a foreigner is not
entirely to blame...I secretly suspect that the Karayans aren&#39;t entirely
satisfied with their homes, either, for they typically spend most of their
days in the outdoors.

These reflections are amongst my thoughts as I ride with my companions
slowly through the new Karaya Village on horseback. We draw a few stares
from the dark-skinned residents of the tribe, but overall are paid little
attention. Ever since the great war over a year ago, the sight of Zexens and
Grasslanders mingling in one another&#39;s respective cultures has become much
more frequent. Still uncommon, but no longer rare. It is a change I enjoy
and have been doing my best to encourage. After all, if Zexen citizens begin
to befriend the Karayans visiting their cities and towns, then the council
will be forced to become accustomed to it as well. They manipulate and use
people, but at the same time, they still must ultimately answer to the
common people of our nation.

I frown at myself ever so slightly, realizing what I am thinking. Yet again,
I have caught myself thinking angrily towards the council. It&#39;s not that I
don&#39;t have reason, of course. I have a full buffet of reasons to dislike
them for. But I worry that my steadily-growing distaste for them and their
practices is slowly yet surely inserting itself into my manner and actions.
More and more often, I find myself at odds with them over matters ranging
anywhere from military to civilian. I cannot seem to help myself sometimes,
and this bothers me greatly.

My gaze turns from the Karayans and their village to my compatriots riding
their own steeds behind me. Two knights, Louis, and Borus. Extremely, no,
ridiculously light security considering how dangerous the council still
believes Karaya. And Borus is not even supposed to be here--he is forsaking
his post to accompany me on this bi-annual conference between Vinay del
Zexay and Karaya (which I and Lucia arranged before parting from Orange
Castle last year). This light security is likely supposed to intimidate me;
a silent threat by the council that they believe they have the means to make
my life difficult and put me in danger at any time. That I am expendable if
I prove to be too much trouble for them.

Thankfully for me, in this instance, what they consider enemy territory I
consider an abode of very dear friends. As my small procession finally makes
its stop before the residence of Lucia, chief of Karaya, I dismount calmly,
maintaining as professional an attitude as I can when I see who is waiting
to greet me.

&quot;Hugo, how good to see you again,&quot; I smile to the young man standing with
his griffon outside the leader&#39;s tent. He has grown since I saw him 6 months
ago, physically and perhaps mentally, as any his age do. But there is still
that boyish gleam to his eyes, the same which he has always had, whether
engaging in play with Fubar, chiding Sergeant Joe, or helping I, Geddoe,
Sasarai, and Thomas to lead so many in war.

He grins to me. &quot;Great to see you, too, Lady Chris. Lucia has sent me to
greet you and your fellow Zexens to our village. Borus, Louis, a pleasure to
see you again as well.&quot;

Louis returns his greeting cheerfully, while Borus simply nods his head. The
other two soldiers with us have dismounted, and I hide a small smile at
seeing how nervously they glance about, how their arms carefully never stray
far from their sheathed swords, and how hard they try to hide their unease
from myself and Hugo. New recruits, obviously.

&quot;If you&#39;ll follow me,&quot; Hugo continued formally, &quot;Karaya and Vinay del Zexay
can begin their discussions.&quot;

I nod. There will be a time for pleasantries with my comrades in this
village later, for catching up and for spending pleasant times with them.
For now, though, Lady Chris Lightfellow has her duty to carry out, and Hugo
has been charged with his. I nod to my companions, and the five of us follow
Hugo into Lucia&#39;s home.

The inside is a well-lit, relatively small dwelling filled with the many
tools and comforts the Grasslanders enjoy and use. I cannot profess to
really know what most of them are. In the center of the main room, Lucia
sits at a table surrounded by a few Karayan warriors.

In stark contrast to her son, Lucia seems not to have aged a day since I
last saw her half a year ago at one of these conferences. Nor, for that
matter, even since the very first time I ever saw her several years ago.
Time seems sometimes to have as little malice for her as it does for a
holder of a True Rune. Her strong face holds no clues to any who wish to
know her years; it could just as easily belong to a Karayan my own age. Her
strong, lithe limbs are taut and smooth as ever, and her eyes still burn
with that fire that knows no age. As usual, Lucia continues to look nearly
my own age despite her nearly 20 years seniority.

&quot;Welcome to my abode, Silver Maiden of Vinay del Zexay,&quot; Lucia says, rising
from her seat to smile and extend her hand to me. &quot;It is good to see you
well, Chris.&quot;

I smile back at my friend, taking her hand happily. &quot;Likewise, Lucia. I&#39;m
pleased to see that your village now seems to be completely rebuilt and
functioning.&quot;

She nods, pleased. &quot;Yes, it has been for a few months now. We&#39;ve all become
quite settled in our new home.&quot;

She sits back down, motioning for I and my companions to do the same. &quot;Well,
Captain, shall we begin?&quot;

I nod, and Borus, Louis, and I all sit, while my two knights stand at
attention in their slightly nervous manner. Hugo goes to take his place
beside his mother, and the meeting is commenced. This conference is an idea
that she and I had before parting ways from Orange, fairly shortly after
we&#39;d had sex that day. The idea had been that whether in war or peace, the
two military leaders of Karaya (which is the closest to leader tribe that
the Grasslands have) and Vinay del Zexay should meet for a single conference
to discuss the status of relations between the Grasslanders and Zexens, and
see if any solutions could be brought about to whatever problems might be
plaguing relations between our peoples. Because of their recent veto on
actual peace-talks and treaties with the Grasslanders despite Salome&#39;s best
efforts, the Zexen Council was at least willing to compromise and allow me
this request when I brought it forth.

At the moment, though, Vinay del Zexay and the Grasslands are actually on
fairly better terms than usual, even from the perspective of the overly
aggressive council. This comes mainly from the actions of Tinto to the
south. They have so far been testing their boundaries, and it is feared that
they will soon want to expand into Zexen territory, having failed several
decades ago to rout the Grasslanders from their lands. Thus, most military
attention and discomfort of my country is directed at this new problem, and
not so much at its traditional Grassland foes. At the same time, the
Grassland nations are showing less aggressive interest in Vinay del Zexay as
well, for they still carry a heavy grudge against Tinto and its people.
There may even come a time when both sides cooperate against this common
enemy. If there must be conflict again, I hope that this will be the case.

Thanks to the unusually-agreeable circumstances of our nations&#39;
relationship, the meeting&#39;s contents are mostly focused on smaller troubles,
such as economic difficulties and minor incidences of disturbance, along
with possible plans for the future. Though Boris and Hugo both occasionally
participate in the discussion, it is mostly a talk between I and Lucia. She
is an enjoyable conversationalist, even on such professional a
subject--enthusiastic, energetic, and eager, always persisting for the best
situation she can get from me for her tribe. Even as we argue, I enjoy the
fact that we can do such without open hostilities now, as two friends on
differing sides of a debate rather than enemies. Though I must admit that my
two knights do look increasingly tense as time goes on; still, all things
considered, they&#39;re handling themselves fairly well for all the propaganda
has prepared them for.

Finally, the discussion wears down as the window pane shows the sun&#39;s slow
descent down to the horizon is nearly complete. Some fair progress has been
made, I believe, as Lucia suggests that we end this meeting for rest and
preparation for our return to Vinay del Zexay. Her side of the table and
mine all rise to leave, but Lucia stops me and asks that I might stay for a
time for a private discussion between commanders only. Boris turns to me
questioning, and I nod, wondering what Lucia might want further of me. Boris
nods back, and soon the dwelling is empty save Lucia and I.

Lucia smiles in a tired way and stretches her arms a bit, not making any
motions for me to sit back down. &quot;Phew,&quot; she sighs, &quot;I really do hate formal
meetings like this...&quot;

Seeing that Lucia&#39;s letting herself relax, I do as well, dropping my usual
stiffly formal posture and allowing myself to stand at ease. &quot;I&#39;m not too
fond of them myself,&quot; I answer her. &quot;I do appreciate your being willing to
go through with these talks twice a year with me. It could be very important
someday.&quot;

She nods as she finishes her stretch, strangely fierce eyes slanted in a
knowing smile. &quot;Yes, I know. It&#39;s a small price to pay for any potential
peace...besides, it gives Hugo a chance to learn a little about peace-talks
with Zexens. He&#39;s getting old enough that I need to seriously start grooming
him to take over soon. I&#39;m not going to be strong for too many more years,
I&#39;m afraid.&quot;

My eyebrow raises on its own as I reply, &quot;Really? You seem as strong and
able as any half your age, in battle...or out.&quot;

Her mouth parts in a small grin as she picks up my meaning. &quot;Actually,
Chris, speaking of that, the reason I asked you to stay behind is that I was
wondering if you&#39;d like to do that again.&quot;

Do that again...? My mind doesn&#39;t comprehend for a moment, then suddenly
realizes what she&#39;s asking. &quot;You mean you want to have sex again?&quot;

She nods. &quot;Why, if I might ask?&quot; I say. I do so not out of any unpleasant
reaction to the idea, but rather out of simple curiosity, for the main
reason that we were together last time no longer really applies.

She shrugs, staring as unemotionally at me as her emotional eyes are able.
&quot;None beyond personal satisfaction this time. You&#39;re very skilled and
attractive, and I would enjoy the opportunity to be with you again if you
wanted. You were with too many companions last time you visited here for me
to mention it.&quot;

&quot;Just sex for its own sake, then?&quot; I ask.

She shrugs again. &quot;I suppose you could say that, yes.&quot;

I have to think for a moment about the proposal. Thus far, my occasional
intimacies with women have always had a factor of personal attraction and
lust involved, but overall been for a more emotionally-centered cause than
simply that. It&#39;s actually a fairly new idea to me to have sex just for
pleasure.

Not an idea I dislike, though. Lucia may claim to be in late middle age by
mental reckoning, but her lithe, taut dark body, powerful and graceful,
would be the envy of any woman my own age. The hard, physical life of a
Karayan has preserved her skin and form very well from the effects of time
that many Zexens feel with their more comfortable, complacent lifestyle. And
as I have discovered in the past, she is quite adept sexually (I have
remembered being with her on many lonely nights, to be truthful!).

&quot;Alright, Lucia,&quot; I respond agreeably, vocally masking my excitement at this
new idea, &quot;I would like that.&quot;

We waste no time after these words shedding our attire. She is done quite
quickly disrobing herself of the simple, free Karayan clothing, leaving me
to gaze as I also undress at her near-flawless physique. My memories made no
exaggerations; if anything, they dampened the powerful effect seeing her has
upon me. Her limbs are toned and powerful, her stomach taut and strong, her
bosom supple and alluring, her face powerful and beautiful also. Nowhere on
her dark, smooth body did she give any indication of being even a year my
senior, let alone over a decade. Her skin is a bit darker than I remember,
and her hair a bit brighter a yellow. Perhaps the return from the indoor
life at Orange Castle to the outdoors life in the sun at Karaya is the
cause. Whatever the case, however, the sight of her standing confidently
naked before me is quite arousing, and I hurry as fast as I can to divest
myself of my remaining armor and undergarments.

After a few minutes, my armor is piled about me on the floor (how Salome
would look discouragingly at it so neglected), and I step forward as bare as
my friend to initiate a deep kiss. There is no slow beginning to it, no
teasing and sweet start. It is hard and strong from the very opening. Our
lips crush one against each other as we lift our arms around one another,
drawing ourselves together tightly, very tightly. I open my mouth in our
kiss to groan slightly as I feel her large breasts pressed hard against my
own, and she takes this as an invitation to slip her tongue into my mouth
and seek out my own tongue. I raise mine to meet her, and begin to return
her oral caresses.

Both I and Lucia let slip an occasional muffled grunt of lust as we kiss,
each of us getting further and further aroused as we begin to rub our
tightly embraced bodies against one another. I particularly enjoy the warm
pleasure I get as my nipples brush against hers every so often and the
steady stream of pleasant feelings coming from where my vagina presses and
moves against her. It is quickly turning us on further and further.

Finally, perhaps no longer able to resist going on, she pushes away from me
for a moment, and we both stand gasping slightly. The moment passes, and she
comes forward to lay her hands upon my shoulders and gently push down. I
comply, allowing her to guide me lower until I sit with legs spread upon the
cool, soft sod floor of her tent, leaning back upon my two arms.

Lucia lowers herself to her knees beside me, gives me a quick, if intense,
kiss, and then gets on all fours. I watch, breathing rapidly in
anticipation, as she lowers her head to hover mere centimeters over my very
needy core. Her fingers part my lips, and she moves her mouth closer, almost
giving me another kiss on different lips.

Even though I am very eagerly waiting for it, her first tongue&#39;s touch still
sends a shock through me as she quickly thrusts it within me. And the first
shock is not the last by far. She is quickly lapping at me forcefully,
licking my insides strongly and bringing me into a sea of bliss I have too
long been ashore from.

As she does this, bringing me slowly but surely close to orgasm, I lean
forward (careful not to upset her lovely rhythm), bringing my hands to her
smooth, strong back to keep my balance. I lean slightly over, still using
her body as my balance, to get a better reach to my goal. Once I am sure I
have adequate space, I move one of my arms to rest on her rear cheeks,
curling my hand down and inserting my first two fingers into her too-ready
vagina.

A tremor runs through her, and I can both hear and feel her gasp into me (an
interesting feeling, I assure you) at the unexpected invasion. I quickly set
to work, stroking her quickly and moving my digits further in and out at a
set pace. She gently begins to move herself against them with each thrust,
quietly moaning every now and then into me.

She still has quite a head start on me, though, and her lovely relentlessly
persists, performing its wonderful service within me, and now strongly
stroking against my clitoris. It&#39;s not long until, unsteadily jerking (to
her pleasure) and breathing in small, short gasps, I climax, forgetting all
else in the world save the lovely, blissful enrapture that she has brought
me. Through it all, I continue to finger her as best I can, and she
continues to lick me, now greedily lapping at the small amount of fluid I
release. Finally, as I begin to come down from my orgasm, and as she is
busily thrusting hard against my penetrating digits, so very near her own
goal, I move my two fingers slightly apart, and lightly pinch her erect bud.
With a few spasms, I feel her inner walls clench my fingers in orgasm.

We both break away from each other for a moment, breathing deeply and
letting ourselves calm down a little from what we just experienced.
Remembering how much she enjoyed doing so in our last encounter, I offer her
my hand, slick with her juices. She smiles and leans forward to gently lick
it clean, an act that arouses me once more.

I slowly draw my hand away from her, lowering it to a position right over
her womanhood. I gently brush against it with my fingers, enjoying its feel,
and look to her face. She smiles and nods approval, ready for more. Drawing
on technique from last time, I draw my fingers together into a single point,
and carefully begin to ease them into Lucia. She trembles a little as my
hand sinks in up to its knuckles.

Once comfortably inside (better than comfortably from her perspective), I
cautiously spread my fingers a little (caution is always a good policy to
follow in such matters!), just enough to cause major pressure within her
from all sides. As her breathing becomes shallow, I slowly push a little
further in, then pull back a little. I begin to repeat this cycle, slowly at
first, then with increasing speed and vigor. I keep this up until she is so
close once more to orgasm that she practically bucks against my hand.

With my remaining hand, I reach up and lightly pinch one of her nipples,
encircling the other with my mouth. At nearly the same time, I give one
final thrust, opening my hand inside as much as I dare to, pushing against
her walls almost harshly. With a soft cry, she climaxes, her body pushing
against my hand with its own great pressure. I wait until her insides have
stopped pushing and the rest of her stops shaking to retrieve my now
somewhat sore hand.

&quot;Chris,&quot; Lucia tells me, eyes half-lidded, &quot;you are...quite incredible. 
Thank you very much.&quot;

&quot;And thank you as well,&quot; I reply equally gratefully. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time
since I allowed myself this pleasure...far too long, I think.&quot;

We sit for a moment longer, still somewhat recovering from our endeavors,
before she speaks once more. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t suppose anyone will be coming to
check on us for a little while longer...feel up for some more?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; I respond cheerfully. &quot;After all, I believe that right now you
owe me one.&quot;

She smiles deviously. &quot;Why, so I do. Let&#39;s remedy that.&quot;</pre>
