-------

The Falenan Civil War had finally ended at the hands of Faroush, the 
Prince of Falena. Things have settled down in the kingdom, Faroush took 
commandership of the Queen&#39;s Knights. His sister Lymslia ruled the 
Queendom with a kind and gentile hand. The Prince&#39;s royal bodyguard, 
Lyon, was made an official Knight to serve the queendom. It&#39;s been two 
months since the war ended. Lyon continued training to be a knight like 
she always wanted.

 
One day, during one of his many business trips between Stormfist and Sol 
Falena, Faroush found Lyon by the Sun Palace&#39;s front gate. Her training 
seemed to have worn her out as she drank cold water from a leather 
canteen. She noticed the Prince approach, thinking quickly she slipped 
the canteen in her back pocket and bowed to the Prince.

&quot;Ah, Your Royal Highness&quot; she said. &quot;so glad you could return home. Did 
you find Lady Lucretia yet?&quot;

Faroush shook his head in response, but it didn&#39;t matter, Lyon felt that 
maybe it was better for somebody with Lucretia&#39;s talent to be alone for 
now. Lyon felt odd asking the Prince for a favour, but after hesitating 
for a few seconds she opened up.

&quot;Your Highness, I wanna talk to you about something. I&#39;m kind of having 
problems with my duties as a queen&#39;s Knight. I want to protect you and 
Her Majesty from all possible threats, so we never have another 
situation like the Godwins invading.&quot;

She made a heavy sigh as if she&#39;d regret asking the next question.

&quot;My training in the official Queen&#39;s Knights armour makes moving about 
harder than it was months ago fighting along side you. Do you think 
maybe I can seek tutoring from somebody experienced in Knightdom?&quot;

Faroush stroked his chin thinking of an idea. One finally came to him; 
with a big smile on his face he walked into the palace waving his hand 
signaling Lyon to follow him.

Lyon and the Prince made their way through the castle to the Hall of the 
Queen&#39;s Knights. They both walked on in and noticed Miakis and Kyle 
sparring with each other for practice. The both stopped fighting, put 
away their weapons and bowed to the Prince.

&quot;Your Highness&quot; said Kyle. &quot;What could bring you and Lyon here right 
now?&quot;

Miakis smiled gleefully &quot;Have you come to practice sparring, Sire?&quot;

Faroush then walked towards Miakis and quietly whispered something in 
her ear.

&quot;You want me to help Lyon train?&quot; She said. The Prince then nodded in 
agreement.  
&quot;Well, since sparring with ol&#39; Kyle here got pretty boring I suppose I 
can help out.&quot;

Kyle felt insulted towards Miakis&#39; remarks. &quot;Oh come on, Miakis, I&#39;m 
just goin&#39; easy on you because you&#39;re a total fox.&quot;

Lyon caught on the idea of training with a specially trained Knight and 
Bodyguard. She then decided to go with it.

&quot;Miakis, you&#39;ll help me train?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; She replied. &quot;You&#39;ll be on your way to pure Knighthood in no 
time.&quot;

Lyon walked towards the center of the room with her Naganaki weapon in 
her hand.

&quot;So, your highness, are we gonna watch them train or what?&quot; said Kyle

Faurosh shook his head; he then walked out the door facing Kyle. Kyle 
noticed the prince walk out but didn&#39;t want to follow.

&quot;Oh man, I wanted to see them train.&quot; He said.

Miakis waited until both men finally left the room closing the door 
behind them. She turned towards Lyon.

&quot;So, Lyon&quot; she said &quot;What&#39;s the problem with your training? I noticed 
how well you fought months ago while you were helping the prince.&quot;

&quot;Well, Miakis. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m having trouble, it&#39;s just that this 
Knights armour I was given, I can&#39;t get used to moving around in it. I 
can&#39;t get into a proper stance since the top portion of my armour is 
heavier than I&#39;m used to.&quot; Lyon explained.

Miakis nodded. &quot;I see. I&#39;ll tell you what; try getting into a fighting 
stance like you normally would. I&#39;ll look and see what needs 
improvement.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; She said. She grabbed her naganita and got in her traditional 
&#145;L&#39; stance. Her legs were positioned just fine but her upper body was 
hunched over slightly. A slight bit of discomfort was shown on her face. 
&quot;Notice anything wrong?&quot; she said with a bit of sweat on her forehead.

&quot;Well Lyon. Your upper body seems to be bogged down from the armour&#39;s 
weight. Try to straighten your back a bit.&quot;

Lyon slightly moved her torso up a bit to balance out her back. She 
couldn&#39;t move it up to a point where it could be straightened out.

&quot;Here, let me help you.&quot; Miakis said as she walked over to Lyon. She 
softly put her right palm across Lyon&#39;s stomach, pushing up causing her 
back to straighten out.

&quot;M- Miakis, what are you doing?&quot; Stuttered Lyon.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Lyon, just relax, I&#39;m merely bracing your back muscles so 
you can stand up properly and still be comfortable.&quot; Said Miakis. 
&quot;You&#39;ll have a much stronger upper body soon.&quot; Miakis proceeded to 
gently press up on Lyon&#39;s slim and soft stomach, she then placed her 
left palm on Lyon&#39;s tightened lower back and began softly kneading 
Lyon&#39;s lower back muscles. Lyon felt relaxed and stood up a bit 
straighter yet she was sweating a lot more than she did when her back 
was tight and on edge. &quot;There you go, Lyon, this should make you feel a 
bit better. Just keep your upper back straight and your lower back nice 
and limber.&quot;

Lyon felt the gentle hands of Miakis tenderly pressing against her back 
and stomach. She never felt hands this soothing in her life. She 
slightly blushed and smiled at how good it felt. Miakis felt happy to, 
she was used to doing this to Knights in training but she never done it 
on a female recruit, it felt very rewarding for her and the person she 
was treating. Just as the massaging was getting good Lyon felt a sharp 
pain on her lower back.

&quot;OW! NOT THERE!&quot; cried Lyon. She dropped to her knees and started 
rubbing the sore spot on her back. It seemed that Miakis accidentally 
rubbed too hard on the old wound she got from the stabbing in the back 
Dolph gave her two months ago.

Miakis got down on her knees to try and help Lyon up. &quot;Oh my, that wound 
still hurts?&quot; She said &quot;I&#39;m sorry about that; I thought it&#39;d be 
completely healed by now.&quot;

Lyon struggled to stand up. Miakis helped her to her feet.

&quot;This is my fault, Lyon. Let me help you.&quot; She said.

&quot;Ow, ow, ow, it hurts. I need to lie down. Ouch.&quot; said Lyon with watery 
eyes. Miakis helped her out but letting Lyon rest her arm over her 
shoulder to help her to her room. As they both walk down the hallway 
they see Faroush and Queen Lymslia lost in conversation. Lym notices 
Miakis helping the injured Lyon.

&quot;Lady Lyon, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; cried Lym

&quot;Oh, your majesty. Lyon&#39;s old wound she got from the war is acting up 
again, she can&#39;t walk. She needs to lie down for a moment,&quot; said Miakis.

Faroush acted quickly, he turned his back and moves towards the injured 
Knight in training. Lym noticed what he was doing.

&quot;Good idea, big brother. You can carry her on your back to her bedroom.&quot; 
said Lym.

Lyon slowly climbed up on the Prince&#39;s back and put her arms around his 
neck for support. The Prince sprinted as fast as he could towards the 
other end of the hallway, where Lyon&#39;s room was. As soon as he got there 
Miakis came from behind him and opened the door for him. He ran in 
gently letting Lyon down on her bed.

Miakis was concerned over her friend right now. &quot;Prince, will Lyon be 
okay?&quot; she cried. The Prince nodded, which brought a feeling of relief 
over Miakis.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, OUCH! I just need to relax for a bit.&quot; groaned Lyon.

&quot;We should leave her to rest for now, I&#39;ll have the maid bring you some 
cold water in a moment.&quot; said Lym. &quot;Let&#39;s go, big brother.&quot; The Prince 
nodded and followed his little sister out of the room. A feeling of 
guilt washed over Miakis, knowing that something she tried to do to help 
her friend hurt her very badly.

&quot;Oh, Lyon this is all my fault. Please let me make it up to you.&quot; said 
Miakis.

&quot;No, Miakis. It&#39;s alright, I&#39;m just a bit sore is all, nothing too 
dangerous.&quot;

&quot;Well, Lyon. At least do something to help you relax later.&quot; Miakis went 
down on one knee and started gently wiping the sweat from Lyon&#39;s face. 
&quot;When you wake up later on go down to Miroon&#39;s bath house, the hot water 
and steam will help dull the pain.&quot;

&quot;That sounds like a good idea.&quot; said Lyon, softly. &quot;I&#39;ll head there 
after I sleep for a bit.&quot;

Miakis stood up, looking down at the bosom of Lyon as she quietly yet 
quickly fell asleep.

&quot;Good night, Lyon.&quot; whispered Miakis. She quietly walked toward the door 
slowly closing it behind her, before closing it completely she looks at 
Lyon slightly through the crack of the door. She then finally closes it 
and goes about her business once again.

Several hours have passed, and night fell across the kingdom. The hard 
working men were at the famous Falenan bar washeing away the stress of 
the day with the famous wine from the Kanakan region, children were 
asleep in their beds, and a few royal Kingdom staffers were still up 
working hard on trade issues and immigration documents.

A certain Knight trainee finally awoke. Her injury was dulled down to a 
bearable point. She climbed out of bed rubbing her eyes and yawning.

&quot;Ah, my back feels much better.&quot; She said as she scratched her head and 
rubbed her side. She walked over to the door of her room noticing a note 
tacked to the door. She went to it and read it aloud.

&quot;Lyon, if you&#39;re feeling well enough to walk after waking up, head to 
the bath house over by the East Palace. The relaxing hot bath will help 
your pain. Come on by when you&#39;re ready. Miakis.&quot;

The thought of a hot relaxing bath fled through her mind, she felt it 
was something she needed after all the madness she went through. She 
decided to get undressed into a slim bathing suit fitting for a hot 
bath. Once she was dressed she put on a blue robe so she could walk 
through the streets without being seen by anybody.

The streetlamps of Sol Falena were glowing brightly with the flames from 
the nightly torchmans&#39; duties. She calmly strutted down the street 
catching the eyes of all the men walking home from the local taverns, 
hoping not to encounter a rude drunkard. She made it to the end of the 
street and headed East guided only by the light emanated by the moon. 
The raging Ulse that were usually out and active were gone, the only 
animals out to guide Lyon was a glowing set of fireflies.

After walking for about ten minutes she finally made it to the eastern 
palace. When she walked through the front gate, she noticed how empty 
the place was. She noticed the only lit torch by the entrance of a small 
hut.

&quot;This is the only place that&#39;s open right now,&quot; said Lyon to herself. 
&quot;Maybe this is where the bathhouse is.&quot; Lyon slowly walked through the 
door seeing Miron, the owner of the bathhouse noticed Lyon.

&quot;Ah, Ms Lyon,&quot; said the small beaver &quot;I was told to expect you.&quot;

&quot;By whom?&quot; said Lyon with a curious, yet adorable, look on her face.

&quot;Lady Miakis held a reservation for you and her. You&#39;re in room number 
4. Go on in!&quot;

&quot;Uhh, thank you.&quot;

Lyon then bowed and headed into the room with a number 4 on the door. As 
she slid it open she saw a hot steamy large tub of hot water, some lit 
incense, and a relaxed Miakis with a glass of Kanakan wine.

&quot;Ah, Lyon, I&#39;ve been waiting for you&quot; said Miakis. &quot;Are you feeling any 
better?&quot;

Lyon felt odd having to share a bath with another person &quot;oh hello, 
Miakis. What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just relaxing from a hard day of work. Come on in.&quot;

Lyon nervously nodded. She slipped off her robe, wadded it up, and set 
it on a small table by the bath. Lyon slowly walked into the bath and 
sat down. The warm tingling of the hot bath water ran up her back, 
causing all pent up stress to go away. She sat down and relaxed.

Miakis grabbed the bottle of white wine sitting near her. &quot;Would you 
like some wine?&quot; She said

&quot;No thanks.&quot; Lyon politely declined &quot;I don&#39;t drink alcohol.&quot;

&quot;Oh, alright&quot; Miakis said as she put the bottle down behind the tub. 
&quot;So... wanna talk or something?&quot;

Lyon closed her eyes and tilted her head down. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to 
talk about.&quot; Lyon then sort of opens up. &quot;Have you ever... loved 
anyone?&quot;

Miakis stopped sipping on her glass of wine upon hearing that.

&quot;Oh I.... never had a.... lover,&quot; stuttered Miakis. &quot;I don&#39;t even like 
men like other girls do anyway.&quot; Miakis got quiet for a second, the 
wondered about Lyon. &quot;What about you? Don&#39;t you want a lover of your 
own?&quot;

Lyon tilted up at Miakis&#39; eyes. &quot;No... I can&#39;t find anybody who loves 
me. Not like I care really.&quot;

&quot;Not even the Prince?&quot; replied Miakis.

Lyon felt offended a bit and turned her back towards Miakis. &quot;Of course 
not, I&#39;m merely a bodyguard, not his lover.&quot;

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Said Miakis with sadness in her voice. After a few 
seconds of pure silence, and Lyon having her back turned, Miakis waded 
through the water towards Lyon and put her arms around her, held her 
close, and rested her head on her shoulder.

&quot;Wha... what are you doing?&quot; said Lyon. Miakis lifted her head off of 
Lyon&#39;s shoulder and placed her mouth by her left ear.

&quot;Lyon, I love you. I really do love you.&quot; Miakis whispered softly. She 
kissed Lyon&#39;s neck sweetly while cupping Lyon&#39;s left breast. &quot;You&#39;re 
what I need, it&#39;s been you all along.&quot; She held her tighter.

Lyon didn&#39;t know whether to feel uncomfortable or appreciated.

 
&quot;Miakis, you...&quot; Miakis playfully nibbled on Lyon&#39;s earlobe as she was 
trying to talk. Lyon felt the same feelings towards Miakis. She turned 
around and passionately kissed the other female Knight of the lips. &quot;If 
you really do love me then perhaps we were meant to be.&quot; She said as she 
broke the kiss for a moment and then went back into the kiss again.

As they kissed Miakis decided to put her tongue deeper in Lyons mouth, 
the sweet taste of the wine she drank followed. She reached her hands 
around putting them behind Lyon&#39;s back, reaching for the straps of 
Lyon&#39;s bra. Her graceful ninja-like hands unhooked the white garment. 
Miakis tosses the bra letting it float on the surface of the water.

&quot;Are you sure you wanna do this, Miakis?&quot; asked Lyon.

Miakis tilted her head down and kissed Lyon on her chest. &quot;It&#39;s alright 
Lyon. This is what the both of us need.&quot;

Lyon felt as if what was happening between her and Miakis was blissfull, 
neither of them wanted it to end. Lyon ran her fingers through Miakis&#39; 
dark hair and kissed her foreheard.

Miakis felt the tender and loving kiss and rewarded it; Miakis licked 
and lapped softly at Lyon&#39;s left nipple. This aroused Lyon to a point 
she never felt before, she cupped Miakis right breast and caressed the 
nipple with her thumb. Miakis felt the thumb on her bosom and loved it. 
Lyon reached her other hand to her lower regions to try and feel 
pleasure. Miakis noticed what she was doing and grabbed her wrist before 
it made contact with her sensitive spot.

&quot;Lyon, my sweet, you don&#39;t need to do that.&quot; She said winking to the 
trainee Knight. Lyon slowly backed up and sat on the edge of the large 
bath pool. Miakis put her hands on Lyon&#39;s knees spreading them apart.

&quot;Miakis, don&#39;t do this. This is embarrassing.&quot; Lyon said as she tries to 
force her knees back together.

&quot;Trust me, you&#39;ll love this.&quot; Said Miakis as she finally pulled Lyon&#39;s 
legs open.

Lyon decided to quit fighting this and let the young Knight do what 
she&#39;s going to do. Miakis proceeded to put her hands down by Lyon&#39;s 
pleasure spot and put her hand down Lyon&#39;s undergarment and slid her 
fingers inside the trainee&#39;s inner walls. This was a place nothing has 
ever gone this close to in Lyon&#39;s life; and she loved it. Her 
uncomfortable squeaks turned to pleasured moans from Miakis&#39; soft 
fingers penetrating her soft slit. The soft appendages rubbed her faster 
and faster as time progressed. Miakis removed her hand from Lyon&#39;s 
sensitive area, causing a trail of glistening sticky fluid to trail from 
Miakis&#39; finger. She then licked the fluid off her finger in a teasing 
way.

&quot;Lyon, you taste so good. I think you&#39;re ready&quot; said Miakis. She stood 
up from the water seductively and slowly slid off her black bathing 
undergarment. She then proceeded to snap off her top at the front. She 
throws it out of the large bath pool and sits on the ledge with Lyon.

&quot;You... have a nice body&quot; Lyon said nervously. &quot;Mind if I have a better 
look?&quot;

Lyon decided to try her hand at seeing if she can please Miakis as well. 
She laid Miakis down on the floor by the large bath. She kissed her on 
the mouth passionately, then on the neck, and the chest, and to her 
stomach. Miakis felt aroused from the soft kisses, Lyon enjoyed it too, 
as Miakis&#39; skin tasted like sweet vanilla ice cream. Lyon noticed how 
Miakis lower regions were glistening with sticky fluid. Lyon proceeded 
to lap up the fluid with her tongue to see if it tasted sweet like her 
lover&#39;s skin.

&quot;Oh my, how sweet&quot; Lyon giggled &quot;I think I can get a liking for this.&quot; 
She proceeded to dive her tongue into Miakis&#39; wet slot.

&quot;Ah, Lyon, keep doing that!&quot; Miakis gasped.

Lyon took the initiative to lick rapidly, her tongue moved up and down 
in rapid-fire succession. Miakis&#39; squeaked and moaned in synch with the 
movement of her lover&#39;s tongue. Her moans got louder and heavier as time 
progressed. Miakis sat up and kissed Lyon on the head.

&quot;Lyon, you&#39;re the best at this&quot; she said as she laid herself down. Lyon 
then crawls over to her and laid down on Miakis&#39; stomach, each girl had 
their head facing the other&#39;s pelvis. Miakis playfully slid off Lyon&#39;s 
wet and white undergarment and threw it outside the large bath.

&quot;Do it to me, Miakis&quot; said Lyon with a playful grin in her face.

Miakis took Lyon&#39;s prerogative and proceeded to dive her tongue into 
Lyon&#39;s inner walls. Lyon couldn&#39;t help but let out a high pitched moan 
or two in response. It was a feeling of pleasure on a level she had 
never felt before. Lyon felt it was time to return the favour; she 
proceeded to lick up all the sticky wet nectar from Miakis&#39; soft spot.

Both young Knights kept the cycle of pleasure going. Louder and louder 
were their moans and yells of pleasure, it felt so good that Lyon had 
tears coming out of her eyes, as did Miakis. They both wished they could 
go on forever like this.

&quot;Oh god, Miakis, I love this. I think I&#39;m going to come&quot; Lyon gasped. 
&quot;Oh, I feel it.&quot;

&quot;Come with me, we&#39;ll come together&quot; moaned Miakis.

Both proceeded to lick at the tender soft spots and lapped up the sweet 
sticky juices from each other. The finally the climax hit, both girls 
felt a jolt of pleasure through their bodies, immediately followed by a 
loud yell of pleasure. Lyon relaxed and panted very hard to catch her 
breath. She lifted her head up with a trail of nectar coming from her 
mouth to Miakis&#39; warm and moist pelvic region. Lyon crawled off Miakis&#39; 
body and laid down by her lover, giving her a nice warm kiss on the 
lips. They both lapped up the warm fluid trickling from the edges of 
their mouths.

&quot;Lyon, that was amazing. I&#39;m glad to have finally met you, my love&quot; 
Miakis whispered into Lyon&#39;s ear and nibbling on her earlobe. &quot;Promise 
me we can do this more often.&quot;

Lyon held Miakis closer and almost hesitated to answer. &quot;Miakis, I 
really do love you now. Yet, I don&#39;t know if we can keep this up. We 
both have our duties to serve the royal family, I don&#39;t know of us being 
in love can help or not.&quot;

&quot;But Lyon, we don&#39;t have to do this out in the open. We can be Knights 
by day and lovers by night. Our love can be mainly a silhouette, merely 
a dream or a false image. It can only happen in the twilight, so nobody 
else will know.&quot;

Lyon sat up with a cheerful smile on her face. &quot;Silhouettes by Twilight, 
huh? I think this is a good idea. Alright, then, we can do this as long 
as we won&#39;t let our love interfere with our work.&quot;

&quot;That... is all I wanted to hear, my love.&quot; Miakis sat up and 
passionately kissed Lyon for a few seconds. She broke the kiss and 
looked Lyon in the eyes. &quot;We should get back to the palace and get some 
sleep. We got work in the morning.&quot;

Both women proceeded to get their clothes back on. They walked together 
out the door of Room No. 4. As they passed the head counter Miakis 
handed the room key to Miroon. He chuckled as he grabbed the key.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry ladies, I wasn&#39;t watching, but I won&#39;t tell a soul.&quot;

Lyon stopped in her tracks and turned looking at the beaver.

&quot;You knew what was going on?&quot;

&quot;You two were pretty loud in there; I was able to hear you. Don&#39;t worry, 
I was the only one here tonight, and nobody will know, I promise&quot; he 
said with a heavy grin and a hardy laugh.

Miakis turned towards the beaver. &quot;Thank you... Miroon&quot; she bowed and 
grabbed Lyon&#39;s hand and walked out into the night. On their way to a 
blissful night of sleep knowing that they both found the one they loved.</pre>
