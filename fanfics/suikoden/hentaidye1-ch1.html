<h1>A Brief Moment of Lasting Happiness</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../suikoden/index.html">Suikoden</a>

<pre>&quot;This ends my report, sir,&quot; I finish, bowing formally to the bearded man
sitting thoughtfully before me.

&quot;Thank you, General,&quot; Lepant tells me, inclining his head slightly in a
brief, polite nod. &quot;And I trust that General Valeria and our forces were 
of adequate use, Mr. Yamamoto?&quot;

Out of the corner of my eye, I see Freed bowing deeply to my left. 
&quot;Indeed, my lord. The tactical cunning and fierce courage of Valeria and 
the bravery of your soldiers were instrumental in our victory. It was an 
honor to serve beside them.&quot;

There is a distinct, earnest tone to his usual precise and calculated 
voice that allows no doubt that he means each word. A man--a military 
one, no less--from South Window expressing gratitude at having had the 
Toran Republic working alongside him, when only months ago he and every 
other man from his lands still nursed a heavy grudge against my country 
for our past conflict with South Window and Tinto.

War is strange that way. It&#39;s born out of misunderstanding, anger, hate,
greed, desire, power-lust, and so many other divisive characteristics of
humanity. Yet through the experience of it, you can also find many forms 
of compassion, understanding, love, devotion, and forgiveness that aren&#39;t 
seen during times of peace. Had this man not fought back-to-back with me 
in furious combat on the battlefield, if he had not been a leader in 
desperate need of help that we gave freely in a gesture of friendship as 
a neighbor helping to protect his home from another, would he have ever 
been able to feel such brotherhood to people of Toran?

Maybe, maybe not. I&#39;m no philosopher at heart, merely a soldier. All I do
know is that it gives a warm pleasure to see old foes turned to new 
friends this way. If there must be conflict and suffering, then I hope 
there will always be brotherhood and courage to be found at the same 
time.

&quot;Thank you very much for handling this matter, then, General,&quot; Lepant 
tells me, nodding formally once more. &quot;You may go while I speak with Mr. 
Yamamoto about future relations with the new Dunan.&quot;

I turn to go, but am stopped by Lepant giving a sheepish cough. &quot;Oh, and
Valeria,&quot; he adds in an embarrassed tone, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you know when
Sheena plans to return home, do you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid not, sir.&quot;

He nods and thanks me once more, and I exit the room. As the doors close
behind me, I finally have a chance to take in the rich splendor of the
palace from which the land of Toran is ruled. I&#39;m not one for 
extravagance, but nonetheless, the polished floors, the posh decorations, 
the regal glint to everything, they all call to me somehow. They give me 
a sense of comfort and familiarity .

I suppose this feeling can be traced back to a few years ago, soon after 
our forces defeated Emperor Barbarossa and won control of this country. 
There was a need for quick stability then, and part of creating that was 
properly organizing a state military. The politicians amongst us decided, 
for whatever complex reasons politicians have for all that they do, that 
simply reinstating the Empire&#39;s old generals would not be enough, that 
there had to be new generals as well. Before I knew it, I was promoted 
from a common soldier to one of the highest and most powerful military 
positions in all the country.

I smile at the remembrance, amused at my own reaction to it as I walk 
down the corridors. Obviously, I was greatly surprised by it. I had only 
ever been a lower-ranking troop; serving as a regular military warrior 
had always been my goal in life. And here I was, offered the rank of 
General and pleaded with to accept it. I accepted it, of course. After 
all, if nothing else, a good soldier knows that it&#39;s her responsibility 
to do whatever task is needed of her, and if it was believed I was needed 
as a General, then it was my duty to be one.

But for a period of several weeks afterward, the responsibilities and 
tasks before me were all but impossible for me to perform and cope with. 
I was flustered constantly, and I dislike being disorganized and 
confused. And the more I was, the worse it got. Of course, considering 
the hectic chaos of rebuilding, reclaiming, and remaking an entire 
country quickly enough that its people don&#39;t become discontent and 
dangerous, I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t only my new job alone that caused my 
confusion and impatience.

But in those many times when it seemed like too much...I would often just 
stop what I was doing, and simply look around myself. See where I was. 
Once a lowly soldier who turned against her superiors to do what was 
right, and now, a General working alongside some of the finest people I 
have ever known to do exactly what I&#39;d joined the army for, what I&#39;d 
always lived to do: serve my country. The name might change, the leader 
might change, but in the end, it was still the same thousands of people 
living in the country that made it a nation. And this fine, sparkling 
palace was the home of those whom they trusted, whom so many had fought 
and bled and died for to provide a better life for all.

And it may seem odd, but rather than the knowledge that thousands 
entrusted their lives to my efforts and decisions burdening me with 
doubt, it always instead lifted my shoulders higher and gave me 
inspiration to drive onward. And that is what sustained me many times, 
until finally enough time had passed that the country stabilized and I 
became more used to my functions and duties.

Of course, I consider as I stop by the entrance to one room in 
particular, there was another factor, as well. I got a lot of help from 
the experienced and able General Sonya Shulen after a time, as well. Her 
guidance to me even as she dealt with her own affairs in that busy time 
was immensely helpful to me.

I walk over to look into the office I stand by. As I had hoped, Sonya is
sitting in her office. It seems that she&#39;s come back from Shazarade while
I&#39;ve been in Dunan, and is now busily speaking with General Kasumi and
Instructor Kai about some sort of official business. More than likely a
regular meeting to go over various military reports and field data on new
recruits. I don&#39;t wish to interrupt them, so I continue on my way through
the palace to the front gates.

Yes, the reason this place is comforting to me is likely tied to my 
memory of using its significance to bolster my own confidence. Of course, 
a small part of me would also like to believe there is another factor. As 
strong and practical a woman as I am, I still cannot help but 
occasionally entertain a small bit of giddy emotion, so I&#39;d like to think 
that part of the comfort of this palace is that it&#39;s where I first got to 
know Sonya. A small, romantic idea of love at first sight, if you will. I 
know it&#39;s not at all likely, of course; I only really started to fall for 
her a year and a half after she and I first became well-acquainted. And 
though I didn&#39;t waste time in denying the feeling, I also didn&#39;t pay much 
attention to it for a few months. My attention was focused on my work. 
Despite all this, though, I still like to imagine that this palace&#39;s 
appeal comes from the start of our relationship within its walls. I&#39;ve 
few enough girlish qualities that I can be allowed this one, I think.

A warm, breezy Spring day greets me as I make my exit from the palace, as 
do the busy sounds of town life from Gregminster. Children playing, 
people gossiping, the faces of familiar friends...it&#39;s good to be back. 
Dunan Castle was a place of camaraderie and hope, but I much prefer an 
atmosphere of peace and prosperity.

As nice a day as it is, however, at the moment I just want to relax at 
home until I resume my standard duties tomorrow morning, so I walk 
quickly to our house and enter. The house is bright and clean, with a 
fresh smell that I&#39;ve come to recognize as being at home. Sonya has 
always employed three very dutiful and skilled maids to keep her home 
organized and clean since she&#39;s often away at Shasarazade or wherever 
else Lepant feels that she&#39;s needed. That&#39;s not changed since I began 
living with her, for that matter, since I&#39;m away as often as she.

I&#39;m pleased to see that the maids are not here today (though I wouldn&#39;t 
have expected them to be, for Sonya and I give them most days of the week 
off when we&#39;re home in Gregminster). They&#39;re fine people, but I&#39;d just as 
soon have the house, and Sonya, to myself today. After the couple of 
months she was at Shasarazade and the time that I&#39;ve been in Dunan, all I 
really want is to spend some time alone with my lover.

Of course, I can&#39;t do that until she&#39;s finished with work for the day, so
for now, I just quickly look over the house&#39;s interior. It&#39;s good to be
home. I wander over to our bed, thinking to perhaps take a nap before 
Sonya returns, and notice her diary lying on the table. She writes very
infrequently in it, but it seems that she&#39;s made an entry since I was 
home last.

I quietly read it to myself. &quot;Returning here from Shasarazade was 
agonizing. Of course I realize memories weren&#39;t put on this earth just to 
comfort us, but...&quot;

Sonya&#39;s uncommon entries are never long, but they don&#39;t have to be. I 
sigh, put the journal down, and sit upon the bed. This is nothing new for
Sonya...for some reason, the return home from her fortress always reminds 
her of the past, of Teo McDohl. Perhaps such a trip was where she first 
made his acquaintance, or perhaps it was when she first learned of his 
death. Or maybe it&#39;s something else altogether, or perhaps there&#39;s no 
real reason for it; I don&#39;t know, and it&#39;s not my place to ask.

I lay down and look up at the ceiling, taking comfort from its 
familiarity even as I consider what I have just read. I have long since 
ceased feeling the occasional jealousy for how Sonya still mourns Teo&#39;s 
death; it&#39;s foolish of me to feel such a way, after all. She loves me no 
less because of her mourning, and just because we have each other doesn&#39;t 
mean that she should forget her past love for someone who was taken from 
her by a cruel twist of fate.

But just because I do not feel jealous doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not concerned. 
What I want is for her to be happy, and it pains me to see such a strong 
and good woman feeling such pain at times still. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve 
learned by now that my concern does me little good...there&#39;s nothing I 
can actively do to help her beyond simply being with her. I&#39;m a person of 
action, so that&#39;s a hard thing to accept, and not made any easier by the 
fact that I&#39;m NOT able to be with her many times because of our jobs...

I didn&#39;t know I&#39;d fallen asleep, but I must have, for the next thing I 
can clearly sense is two lips I know softly pressed against mine in a 
light kiss. Partly consciously and partly by instinct, I kiss back, my 
eyes fluttering open slowly to take in two blue eyes, so strange and yet 
so well-known to me. Only one person has these eyes, so naturally kind 
and soft, yet with that gentleness having been tempered to be hard and 
strong.

&quot;Sonya,&quot; I murmur as she draws away.

&quot;Welcome home, Valeria,&quot; she smiles.

I sit up, then get up off the bed and enwrap my arms around her, pulling 
us close together. &quot;I&#39;m glad to be home,&quot; I tell her quietly.

&quot;And I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back,&quot; she answers, laying her head to rest on my
shoulder. &quot;I&#39;ve missed you, Valeria.&quot;

I nod, and my cheek caresses her blonde hair as a result. &quot;I missed you,
too.&quot;

&quot;How did things go with the City-State?&quot; she asks as we draw apart.

I shrug. How does anyone sum up something so immense? &quot;It reminded me a 
lot of our civil war, just with two actual countries instead of one split 
apart. Many familiar faces like Flick and Viktor, and some of the new 
ones seemed to remind me of people I knew from our war, too.&quot;

She nods, and begins to organize some paper work on the desk that she 
must have brought home with her. &quot;I had a meeting with Lepant a few hours 
ago about it. He seems very pleased with where this could lead for our 
country and theirs. Sounds like my general did an excellent job.&quot;

I cannot help but give a small smile. &quot;All thanks to you.&quot;

She waves a hand in dismissal as she finishes sorting the papers. &quot;You 
would have gotten the hang of things without my help just fine.&quot;

&quot;Maybe. I&#39;m glad we don&#39;t have to test that theory, though. How was 
work?&quot;

&quot;Tiring,&quot; she sighs, letting some exhaustion she was keeping back be 
shown. &quot;But thankfully uneventful. I was planning to take a nice bath, 
actually. I could use it.&quot;

I nod. Now that she&#39;s mentioned it, I realize that I myself would like a 
hot soak in the tub, as well. The trip from Dunan Castle alongside 
several thousand soldiers is too difficult a one, but still long. A shame 
we couldn&#39;t have used Viki to teleport us all, but she can only handle 
small groups at a time. Besides, no one has seen her since the victory 
feast. She&#39;s probably wandered along her way like many of the others in 
the castle.

&quot;Sounds like a good idea,&quot; I remark. &quot;I think I&#39;ll get one after you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, let&#39;s take one together,&quot; she suggests, stepping over to me again 
and laying her hands on my shoulders. &quot;It&#39;ll be nice, and save time, 
right?&quot;

As if I could refuse an idea like that. &quot;Sure,&quot; I reply, smiling as I 
lean forward to give her cheek a peck.

She nods and separates from me to go upstairs and get the water running.
While she does so, I retrieve an apple from the pantry--my nap has left 
me hungry, and it&#39;ll take a few minutes before the water&#39;s ready. As I 
idly eat the fruit, my eyes wander over to Sonya&#39;s diary again. Oh, yes, 
I&#39;d almost forgotten about that...I should probably talk to her about it. 
Sometimes I wish I were as able with words as she is.

The water&#39;s stopped, and I&#39;m finished with my snack. I climb the stairs 
up to the small second floor of Sonya&#39;s home and enter the bath room. 
Sonya has just finished disrobing, giving me a view of her bare back as 
she walks to the bathtub. She&#39;s a truly beautiful woman...strong, taut, 
lithe arms and legs, feminine in their delicately narrow width, yet well-
toned from battle, whether in practice or earnest, with well-defined 
muscle. Her beautifully flowing blonde hair could be the pride of any 
noblewoman, yet it runs down over a strong and sinewy back, already 
marked with many past battles&#39; scars. She&#39;s always been unashamed for me 
to see them, and I, for one, think that the scattered contrasts they make 
to her otherwise smooth skin is beautiful in its own unique way.

She steps into the large basin and sits, sighing contentedly. Her head
turns, and her gently hard blue eyes fix on me. &quot;Come in with me, 
Valeria...&quot;

I nod, not really having even have needed that single invitation, and 
begin removing my clothes. Before long, my skin and its own scars are as 
bare as hers. I walk to the bathtub where she waits with a dreamily 
relaxed expression, and carefully step into the water. It&#39;s hot, but not 
to an unpleasant degree, and I lower myself to sit in front of her, the 
water level just reaching the bottom of my breasts. I sigh as the warm 
water already begins to calm my form and relieve tension I hadn&#39;t 
realized I was carrying. I lean back until I rest against my lover&#39;s 
front, letting my head lie on her shoulder. I watch her quietly, and she 
watches me, lifting up her hand to gently give my cheek a moist caress.

For the rest of my life, I may remember this moment, this contented 
feeling of love and peace, as one of the best I&#39;ve ever had.

Still staring intently into my eyes, she lowers her lips to mine, giving 
me a very faint, yet all the more poignant kiss. We do this for a few 
seconds, and then she breaks away slowly, laying her head back against 
the edge of the tub and closing her eyes. I don&#39;t move, but rather look 
at her hooded eyes, feel the gentle rhythm of her warm body move slightly 
back and forth against mine, and feel the slight breeze against my hair 
as she breathes.

There are many people who have compared their lovers to angels in such
moments of calm and peaceful bliss. But Sonya has no divine innocence to
her, no ethereal wings sprout from her even figuratively; her body is not
smooth and flawless, nor soft and elegant. She is bound by mortality to 
live and toil on the earth, and not to dance the skies of inquisitive 
ideals and innocence eternal.

I don&#39;t love any angel. I love a human, and I could never settle for
anything better than her.

A few more minutes pass before I reluctantly break this peace. &quot;Are you
okay, Sonya?&quot;

Eyes open, a head rises, and Sonya&#39;s unique gaze is on me again. &quot;What do
you mean?&quot;

&quot;I read your journal...&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; she responds simply, yet there is a profound sense of clarity and
meaning in this short syllable. &quot;I&#39;m fine, Valeria. The memories are 
always hard, but there&#39;s nothing seriously wrong. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;

&quot;I wish I help you somehow...do more for you,&quot; I say earnestly.

I feel the exquisite sensation of her hands gliding to encircle me 
beneath the heated waters. &quot;Being with me is the best help you could 
offer me, Valeria. Please, don&#39;t think otherwise.&quot;

After a moment, I nod. My regret is not absolved, but I accept my 
strength and limitation here. If she tells me that I should not worry 
about it, then I can do nothing else but focus my mind elsewhere.

Like on the way that her hands, having reached one another on my stomach,
are ever so slowly drawing a path upwards. Without a word, I accept her
unspoken offer and let her continue, waiting for them to reach their
destination and enjoying the faint tickling sensation of their brushes as 
I do. I suddenly see and realize that my nipples are plump in 
anticipation already for her approaching touch, and that I&#39;m breathing 
quickly. Having laid here so close to her, our bodies pressed together, 
has been affecting me whether or not I noticed before. The knowledge sends 
a pleasurable shiver throughout me, and I&#39;m certain I can hear and feel 
Sonya give ever so small a chuckle as she feels it.

Perhaps because I&#39;ve unconsciously made my desires known to her, her slow
path speeds up and reaches my chest within a moment. There, they content
themselves with letting each of their ten fingers spread apart and begin
dancing calmly across my globes, ticking and arousing me with the 
sensation of being teased in ten different places at once. I quietly 
murmur my appreciation and push myself back slightly, seeking to be 
closer still.

Her play doesn&#39;t last for long, and surprisingly enough, I&#39;m actually a
little disappointed at its exit, even though she replaces it with a 
higher degree of pleasure when she begins to run her hands back and forth 
over my nipples. Back and forth they glide, like a wave of the very water 
we sit in...a playfully mischievous wave, which begins to move its 
motions gradually to let her fingertips take over the stimulation. Yet 
again, my love changes her tactic, and with one hand begins to lightly 
pluck at my right peak with thumb and forefinger, sometimes rolling it 
between the two digits.

Sonya is no angel, but I do sometimes wonder if she can be a mind-reader,
for her other hand has apparently heard the jealousy my sex has begun to
feel over its neglect, and reaches down through the water to begin 
stroking its outer lips slowly. I grunt slightly, pleased at the feeling.

Once again, she takes her cue from me, and two fingers stray from their
friends to enjoin within me, stroking me from the inside like I am 
stroked on the surface. The feeling is strong, and it&#39;s good. And it 
doesn&#39;t stop, this deliciously sensuous feeling of her fingers swimming 
within me, sliding through the water and against my core with pleasurably 
devious intent.

But it&#39;s even better when, while that happens, she moves her thumb over 
my clitoris. I give a slight start as electric pleasure is conducted 
through the water and my skin.

And that&#39;s only the initial grazing. Sonya begins to move her thumb over 
my bud again, and again, until it&#39;s become a continuous motion, with the
forceful pleasure coursing through me in a continuous wave. No longer is
this just an act of simple loving, now the air is charged both with 
romance and the erotic. She&#39;s pressing harder against me from all sides, 
the water providing exquisite lubrication and letting her move faster and 
faster, and it&#39;s so much more than I can bear as I writhe and small 
groans escape me despite my best efforts. Finally, my body releases me 
from this happy tension, and bliss washes over me like the turbulent 
waves of water, stirred from our passions. My seas calm, the storm is 
over, and I lay back to rest in Sonya, my safe harbor.

My eyes seek out hers above, and my lips move. &quot;Thank you,&quot; I say, so 
softly that even I cannot hear it.

But whether she can tell my meaning from the passing whisper, or simply
knows from my lips, her face and eyes smile and respond, &quot;It was my
pleasure.&quot;

&quot;No...that comes now.&quot;

I lift myself forward, my surge creating another in the still-warm water
around us. I carefully turn myself around, taking care not to slip, and
reach outside the basin. My hand blindly seeks for a moment before 
brushing against the small box I want. Still without eyes to guide it, it 
undoes the clasp and opens it, reaching within. I draw my hand up, 
holding the contents which we both know well.

Sonya&#39;s soft smile takes on a more enthusiastic tone as she looks at what 
I have. It had not been an easy object to obtain in a country in which
everyone knows both of our faces, but a past diplomatic visit to a
neighboring nation many months ago had provided all the opportunity we&#39;d
required.

What I grasp now is a slightly curved light blue cylinder made of glass, 
a little over half a foot long. There are slight irregularities in the
otherwise smooth and flawless glass, small bumps in it in a few places.
We&#39;ve never been sure if that&#39;s intentional or simply poor craftsmanship,
but either way it&#39;s definitely appreciated, particularly by Sonya. This 
can be a lot of help to her when she&#39;s at home for weeks or even months 
alone while I&#39;m off on military business. While I do enjoy it myself, 
she&#39;s particularly fond of it--she generally enjoys having something 
larger and more solid than fingers to clench during sex.

I lean forward now, supporting myself with my free hand and knees, to 
kiss her, driving my tongue into her mouth to poke and prod at her own. 
It&#39;s a passionate meeting, but short-lived, as I pull away a few inches 
and bring the dildo down through the water to rest against her inner 
thigh.

Sonya brings both arms out of the water to grip onto the sides of the
bathtub, then bends her legs to bring her feet flat against the bottom.
Keeping her balance with her arms, she lifts herself a little and moves
slightly so that the dildo&#39;s end is against her entrance.

I look in her eyes to make sure she&#39;s ready for it, and she nods, her
breathing irregular in anticipation. After all, she must have become 
aroused herself while passing love to me before. I carefully begin to 
prod and probe her folds with the glass object, seeking careful entrance 
within since neither of us has a hand free to spread her further open. 
After a few moments, I&#39;m satisfied with where it is and gently push it 
deeper.

The effect is quick and strong. She murmurs a soft &quot;Oh!&quot; and closes her 
eyes in pleasure. I smile at being able to give her such a feeling, and 
move it a little out, then push it in again, now going a little further 
with my thrust. This time, she uses her grasp on the sides of the basin 
to push herself forward, forcing the dildo a little further in. As I pull 
it back, she pushes with her legs to retreat a few inches as well. The 
process is repeated again, and again, a little more each time, until soon 
we&#39;re both a continuous motion, as waves against a beach.

She leans her head back, eyes still closed, mouth slightly open and 
cheeks flushed as I press against her over and over again. Her breasts 
catch my attention; they move along with her, dipping their bottom below 
the water&#39;s surface and returning above it with every cycle we make. I 
find myself lowering my head to one of them and taking its center into my 
mouth to steady it. She sighs pleasurably as I begin to stroke and play 
at the  nipple with my tongue. The tempo is increased further.

Finally, one last large thrust on both our parts brings her over the 
edge, and with a slight tremor and a high-pitched moan which I can&#39;t 
help but silently call cute, our efforts are rewarded. Breathing 
heavily, she opens her eyes slightly and lowers herself against the back 
of the tub, content for now. I lean forward and kiss her, discarding our 
toy in favor of better balance. She kisses back for a moment, and then 
stops to say, &quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;And I love you,&quot; I whisper back.

We&#39;ll have to get out soon, for the water is already starting to cool, 
but for now we can stay like this. Soon, perhaps even tomorrow, one or 
both of us will be called away to somewhere else in the country to 
perform an important duty. That&#39;s how it is for us...at most, we have as 
much time with one another as we are separated. We must be contented 
with limited times to have a life together...but what times I can share 
with Sonya, what times we DO have together to love and live with one 
another, are enough.</pre>
