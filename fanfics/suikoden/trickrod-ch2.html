<a href="../suikoden/trickrod-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>**PLACE: Valley Somewhere Near Tendo Castle

	It was a bright sunny day.  There were flowers growing 
everywhere and birds were chirping songs that can lighten up a 
person&#39;s spirit.  In the middle of a valley lying close to the famous 
Tendo Castle in the Jowston region, there was a young 16-year-old girl 
named Meg who was wandering around the valley with a smile on her 
face.
	&quot;It&#39;s such a beautiful day, today&quot; said Meg, &quot;Flowers are 
growing, birds are singing, and there is a fresh smell in the air.&quot;  
As Meg was continuing her travels in the valley, she heard the sound 
of a horse&#39;s neigh.  Meg stopped in her tracks after she heard the 
sound and turned around to see Millie riding towards her atop 
Sigfried, a ghostly white unicorn that recently became part of the 
Saotome Army.  Sigfried slowed down as he got closer to Meg and 
stopped right in front of her.
	&quot;Hi Meg!&quot; greeted Millie &quot;Want to ride the unicorn with me?  I 
guaranteed that it&#39;ll be fun!&quot;
	&quot;Sure, I&#39;d love to ride with you!&quot; replied Meg.  She started to 
climb atop Sigfried and sat down on his back behind Millie.
	&quot;I love you Millie!&quot; said Meg in a graceful tone.
	&quot;I love you too Meg!&quot; said Millie in the same fashion.  Meg held 
on Millie&#39;s shoulders as they both put their lips together and kissed 
each other passionately.  Sigfried then got up on his hind legs, made 
an excited neigh, got back on all four legs, and galloped off through 
the valley.

**PLACE: Meg and Millie&#39;s Room

	Meg has just woken up from a long night&#39;s sleep.  She woke up 
rather suddenly with a confused look on her face.
	&quot;It was only a dream!&quot; said Meg, &quot;A rather strange dream...&quot;  
Meg looked out her window and saw that it was barely even dawn yet.  
&quot;It&#39;s still early and I can&#39;t get back to sleep...&quot;  Meg looked to her 
right side where Millie and Bonaparte are sleeping soundly together.  
Meg felt lucky to be a close friend of Millie.  She is a sweet, happy 
little girl with very little care for the world and shows respect for 
anything that makes her life interesting.  Those and her good looks 
and somewhat amusing bond with her pet, Bonaparte, are what got Meg 
attracted to her the moment they first met.   Meg&#39;s feelings for 
Millie kept developing as she got to know her day after day and she 
didn&#39;t want to hide her secret any longer.
	&#39;It&#39;s been months since we first met,&#39; she thought, &#39;I think 
it&#39;s time she finds out.  I&#39;ll have to find the perfect moment for it, 
and I think I know how...&#39;
	Morning has finally came.  The sun was shining brightly in the 
sky and many of the people in Tendo Castle has woken up from their 
sleep.  Millie has just gotten out of bed to get ready for another day 
in the Saotome Army.  She took Bonaparte into her arms while he was 
still asleep and was about to leave the room for breakfast when she 
saw that Meg&#39;s bed was empty.
	&#39;Hm, Meg must be in the kitchen already.&#39; she thought.  Before 
Millie even made a move toward her room door, the door busted open and 
in came an excited Meg.
     &quot;Good morning Millie!&quot; cried Meg as Bonaparte finally woke up 
from the shouting, &quot;Hope you&#39;re ready for an exciting day!&quot;
     &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; asked Millie.
	&quot;Well, I made some plans for the day and I was wondering if you 
could be involved.  Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re not going to do anything 
dangerous or risky.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like it.&quot;
	&quot;Hmm, if you say I&#39;ll like it then I guess I&#39;m in.&quot;
	&quot;Cool.  We&#39;ll start after breakfast.&quot;
	Meg immediately leaves the room and left Millie inside with 
Bonaparte.
	&#39;I wonder what she is up to,&#39; she thought.

**PLACE: Tendo Castle Entrance

	After breakfast time was over, Millie was told by Meg to wait 
for her by the entrance of the castle.  Millie has no idea what Meg 
was planning for her but knowing her, it may be really strange or 
somewhat odd.  She waited at the entrance for some time while waiting 
for Meg to arrive.  While waiting, Bonaparte (who was usually in her 
arms) made a small weeping sound that sounded like it came from a 
puppy.
	&quot;What is it?  Are you tired of waiting?&quot; Bonaparte made a 
squeaky noise this time.  &quot;I know you don&#39;t like waiting but Meg told 
us to wait for her right here.&quot;
	Suddenly, Millie heard a voice from nearby. &quot;Hello Millie,&quot; it 
said.
	&quot;Hello Meg,&quot; replied Millie as she looked up from Bonaparte and 
to her right where Meg was standing.  When Millie saw Meg, she was a 
bit surprised to see what she was wearing.  Instead of her usual 
&quot;trickster&#39;s&quot; dress, she was wearing a beautiful sky-blue dress with 
yellow silk-laces attached to the gown&#39;s shoulders and an ocean-blue 
skirt that goes down past her knees.  She was also wearing a pair of 
white shoes made of soft leather.  Her hair was still in the same 
ponytail that she always wears.
	&quot;You ready?&quot; asked Meg.
	&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; said Millie. &quot;But I have a question.  Why&#39;d you 
dress so... elegantly?&quot;
	&quot;Oh this?  My parents bought this for me back when I was at 
Lenankamp.  I liked the colors but I barely wore because I thought I&#39;d 
ruin it from all the gadgetry I often work with.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s a beautiful dress.&quot; Millie complimented.
	&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied Meg as she scratched the back of her neck with 
her left arm.
	&quot;So what are we doing first?&quot;
	&quot;Well, I thought the first thing we should do is see a show at 
the castle&#39;s theatre.&quot;
	&quot;Who&#39;s performing?&quot;
	&quot;I haven&#39;t checked on that but whoever performs, we&#39;ll still 
have fun.  Right?&quot;
	&quot;Sure, I like having fun.&quot;  As Meg and Millie started walking 
towards the stage, Bonaparte started to make some begging noise and 
Millie stopped so she could give it attention.  &quot;Is something wrong, 
Bonaparte?&quot;  Bonaparte made another sound.  Somehow, Millie was able 
to understand what it wanted.
	&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Meg.
	&quot;Bonaparte wants to stay in our room.  I think he&#39;s sleepy or 
something.&quot;
	&quot;Okay, why don&#39;t you go on ahead and I&#39;ll wait for you?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;

**PLACE: Meg &amp; Millie&#39;s Room

	As Meg was heading to the castle&#39;s stage, Millie headed off to 
her room where she was to leave Bonaparte as requested.  She had to 
make sure that everything is safe before she leaves him behind.
	&quot;You sure you&#39;ll be fine by yourself?&quot; asked Millie.  Bonaparte 
replied with another small squeaking sound.  &quot;You sure?  Okay, I&#39;ll 
leave you here and Meg and I will return soon.&quot;  Millie put Bonaparte 
down on her bed and then headed for the door.  Just then, Millie 
started to have a thought when she was close to the exit.  &#39;Hm, Meg 
asked me to go to the theatre with her and she was all dressed up,&#39; 
she thought, &#39;I wonder if she is..&#39;

**PLACE: Tendo Castle Theatre

	Meg arrived at the performance theatre of Tendo Castle and found 
two empty seats towards the front.  Meg sat down at one of the seats 
and made sure no one would take the other seat while waiting for 
Millie to return.  That&#39;s when she started to have some thoughts.
	&#39;Millie sure is taking her time.  She must be making sure that 
Bonaparte would be safe alone.  I wonder if she is going to like me 
better when all this is done and finished.&#39;  Meg continued waiting as 
she continued to reserve the seat next to her.  &#39;There sure are a lot 
of people in this theatre.  I wonder what kind of performance will be 
showing.&#39;  She continued waiting and couldn&#39;t help but wonder why 
Millie is taking so long.  &#39;Where&#39;s Millie?  Is Bonaparte giving her 
trouble or something?&#39;  Just then, Meg heard a pair of footsteps 
nearby.  She could tell that they were heading towards her so she 
looked in the direction of where the footsteps came from.
	&quot;Hey Meg,&quot; greeted Millie.
	&quot;Millie???&quot; When Meg saw Millie, she was terribly surprised 
about how Millie looked.  While Millie was away, she got dressed into 
a long black gown with a dark green cape that goes over her shoulders.  
She also wore a French, dark-green barret that matches her new outfit.
	&quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind if I got into an elegant look as well,&quot; 
said Millie.
	&quot;Oh no, it&#39;s fine,&quot; said Meg.  &quot;You look wonderful!&quot;
	&quot;Thanks.&quot;  Millie then sat down on the seat that was reserved 
for her.  Meg couldn&#39;t help but notice that Millie was sitting so 
close to her, so close that hips were touching one another.  &quot;So, did 
you check what kind of performance is showing?&quot;
	&quot;I still don&#39;t know, but I hope that it&#39;ll be either Annallee or 
Karen.  They both perform some really good shows.&quot;
	&quot;I agree.  I really hope they&#39;ll be on today.&quot;  Just then, the 
lights that were shining over the audience went dim and the lights 
over the stage got brighter.  &quot;Hey, I think it&#39;s starting.&quot;  As Meg, 
Millie and the rest of the audience were anticipating the oncoming 
performance the 2 kobolds, Gengen and Gabocha, walk onto the stage 
from behind the curtains.
	&quot;Hello!&quot; said Gengen, &quot;I&#39;m Gengen, proud soldier of great 
Saotome Army and this is my great pal Gabocha!&quot;
	&quot;Hello, great people!&quot; said Gabocha.
	&quot;Gengen and Gabocha are happy with being in Army.  To honor 
great army, Gengen and Gabocha perform popular kobold folk dance!&quot;
	&quot;Hope you enjoy!&quot;
	And so the show started.  A band in the backstage room started 
playing a little music for the two kobolds to start their folk dance.  
The dance lasted for about 3 minutes before it finished.  When the 
dance was over, there was very little applause but they didn&#39;t seem to 
really notice or even care at all.
	&quot;Thank you Saotome Army!&quot; said Gengen and Gabocha together.  
They walked off the stage through the curtains as most of the audience 
either liked it, hated it, or had some mixed feelings on the show.  
Meg and Millie both got up from their seats and walked out.
	&quot;Well, that was... interesting...&quot; said Meg in a somewhat 
confused look.
	&quot;You think so?  I thought it was kind of cute!&quot; replied Millie.  
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen a kobold folk dance before, and I enjoyed that.&quot;
	&quot;You liked it?&quot; asked Meg.
	&quot;Sure I did!  We should do this again sometime!&quot;
	&#39;Wow!  She liked it!&#39; thought Meg. &#39;I think she&#39;s going to like 
me!  Although I can&#39;t help but notice why she has dressed up so 
elegantly like I did.&#39;
	&quot;Hey Meg, what else do you want to do?&quot;
	&quot;Huh?&quot;
	&quot;What else do you want to do?&quot;
	&quot;Oh!  Um... How about we take a view at the lake?  We could sit 
by the farming fields.  That area has the most beautiful view.&quot;
	&quot;Okay!  I always like to watch over the lake!  It&#39;s so pretty!&quot;

PLACE: Tendo Castle Farm Fields

	After watching the strange performance with dancing Kobolds, Meg 
and Millie decided that they wanted to watch over the northern lake by 
the fields where Tony grows his vegetables and where Yuzu raises her 
farm animals.  Meg and Millie passed by both fields as they said &quot;Hi&quot; 
to Tony and Yuzu and sat down by the nearby lake that is seen right 
next to the farm.
	&quot;It&#39;s so pretty!&quot; said Millie.  &quot;I could watch this all day.&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t know about that.  Wouldn&#39;t Bonaparte be worried about 
you?&quot;
	&quot;Heh, I guess you&#39;re right.  Well, let&#39;s just enjoy the moment 
while it lasts.&quot;
	As Meg and Millie both admired the scenery, Millie started 
having some thoughts.
	&#39;I wonder if what I&#39;m thinking is true...  Does Meg have some 
kind of crush on me?&#39;  Millie kept pondering this thought as Meg was 
getting thoughts of her own.
	&#39;Millie looks so pretty today.  I must have caught her heart by 
now.&#39;  As Millie continued staring over the norther lake, Meg decided 
to take a look at Millie.  &#39;I wonder if I really did catch her heart.  
She did dress up to look pretty for me like I did for her.  Even her 
face looks somewhat different.&#39;  When Meg noticed a difference in 
Millie&#39;s complexion, she decided to take a closer look.  That was when 
Millie noticed that Meg was looking at her too closely.
	&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; asked Millie.
	&quot;Millie?&quot; asked Meg, &quot;Are you wearing make-up?&quot;
	Millie looked at Meg, gave her a smile and replied, &quot;Why yes.  
So you&#39;ve finally noticed.&quot;
	&quot;I thought there was something about your face, and it&#39;s 
beautiful!&quot;
	&quot;I knew you&#39;d say that.&quot;
	&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
	&quot;Well, I knew there had to be a reason you invited me out with 
you, and why Bonaparte asked me to leave him in our room.&quot;
	&quot;Oh?  What do you suppose that reason would be?&quot;
	Millie edged closer to Meg while keeping the smile on your face.  
&quot;Did you bring me into this date because you like me and you wanted to 
get me to like you back?&quot;
	&quot;What?!&quot;
	&quot;C&#39;mon Meg!  You won&#39;t have to lie or make up an answer.  You 
can just answer me truthfully.&quot;
	&quot;Uh, well I...  I guess...&quot;  This was it for Meg.  She was 
finally going to let it out.  She was having trouble trying to reveal 
her secret as she was feeling nervous and had some sweat tears 
dripping out of her forehead.  &quot;I suppose you can say that but...&quot;
	&quot;So you do have a crush on me?&quot; asked Millie as she kept her 
smiling face towards Meg.
	Meg looked down with blushing cheeks and said, &quot;So you&#39;ve 
figured me out.  I knew you&#39;d find out if we went out like we just did 
today.&quot;  Meg took a peek at Millie who still seemed to be smiling at 
her.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you uncomfortable with having someone of the same gender 
getting a crush on you?&quot;
	&quot;Not really, I have to admit I did like a few girls in my youth.  
Hehe..&quot;
	&quot;So you don&#39;t feel any sense of humiliation?&quot;
	&quot;No!  How can I feel humiliated from someone with an interesting 
life?  You&#39;re so outgoing and full of life!  I like people like that.&quot;  
Millie continued smiling at Meg.  Meg then returned the smile.
	&quot;Wow!  I never thought that you&#39;d...&quot;  Suddenly, Meg was 
interrupted when Millie put her hand behind her head and pulled her to 
hers so that their lips touch each other softly.  As the two young 
girls kissed each other passionately, Meg put her arms around Millie 
as Millie pur her other arm around Meg.

**PLACE: Valley Somewhere Near Tendo Castle

	It was a bright sunny day.  There were flowers growing 
everywhere and birds were chirping songs that can lighten up a 
person&#39;s spirit.  In the middle of a valley Tendo Castle, Meg was 
wondering around the valley with a smile on her face.
	&quot;It&#39;s such a beautiful day, today&quot; said Meg, &quot;Flowers are 
growing, birds are singing, and there is a fresh smell in the air.&quot;  
As Meg was continuing her travels in the valley, she heard the sound 
of a horse&#39;s neigh.  Meg stopped in her tracks after she heard the 
sound and turned around to see Millie riding towards her atop 
Sigfried, a ghostly white unicorn that recently became part of the 
Saotome Army.  Sigfried slowed down as he got closer to Meg and 
stopped right in front of her.
	&quot;Hi Meg!&quot; greeted Millie &quot;Want to ride the unicorn with me?  I 
guaranteed that it&#39;ll be fun!&quot;
	&quot;Sure, I&#39;d love to ride with you!&quot; replied Meg.  She started to 
climb atop Sigfried and sat down on his back behind Millie.
	&quot;I love you Millie!&quot; said Meg in a graceful tone.
	&quot;I love you too Meg!&quot; said Millie in the same fashion.  Meg held 
on Millie&#39;s shoulders as they both put their lips together and kissed 
each other passionately.  Sigfried then got up on his hind legs, made 
an excited neigh, got back on all four legs, and galloped off through 
the valley.
