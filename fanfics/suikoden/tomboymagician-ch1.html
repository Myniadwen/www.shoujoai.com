<h1>The Tomboy and the Magician Girl</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../suikoden/index.html">Suikoden</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tenkaistar.html">The Tenkai Star</a><br> </h2>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Two years have passed since the 
war between the Jowston City-States and the Highland Kingdom ended, 
and the residents at Dunan Castle have moved on with their lives; Shu 
was doing trades, Jeane opened a rune shop in the Zexan nation&#39;s Brass 
Castle, and Riou, Jowy, and Nanami moved back to Kyaro. Nanami and Riou 
opened up Genkaku&#39;s old dojo and made a living teaching people all over 
the land the Fierce Dragon style of martial arts. They got so many customers 
that there wasn&#39;t a person in the entire nation that didn&#39;t know about 
the dojo.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">One day, late at night Nanami was 
practicing with her triple rod in the empty courtyard of the dojo. She 
did a wonderful display of flails, kicks, and punches that were perfectly 
choreographed; it was a form grandpa Genkaku taught her while he was 
still alive. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">After about a minute of dance-like 
moves she stopped to catch her breath. The silence in the courtyard 
was pierced with the sound of hands clapping. Nanami turned around to 
source of the clapping to see a familiar girl wearing a blue dress and 
a white hat with an eight-eyed groundhog sitting on her shoulder.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">That 
was amazing, Nanami!” said the girl.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Millie? 
Is that you? It&#39;s been so long. I thought you went to Crystal Valley 
to study,” said Nanami. She ran over to Millie, and both girls joined 
hands.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">I&#39;ve 
decided to go around the world meeting up with all our friends from 
the war. Where are Riou and Jowy?” asked Millie.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Oh, 
my little brother is out sparring with Jowy in the mountains.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">So, 
where did you learn that form? It was impressive.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Oh, 
it&#39;s just some form that masters of the triple-rod  perform. My 
grandpa calls it the Holy Dragon Fang form.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Millie sat on the small stool behind 
her and the small groundhog creature jumped off her shoulder and gracefully 
landed on the ground.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">I 
see Bonaparte is doing okay,” said Nanami as she squatted down to 
pet him.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Oh 
yeah, he&#39;s just amazing. Come sit next to me and I&#39;ll have him show 
you this new trick I taught him.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Well, 
okay,” said the tomboy as she quickly sat on another stool next to 
Millie.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Okay 
Bonaparte, do your special backflip,” said Millie.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Bonaparte then got on his hind 
legs and did a short jump about three feet in the air, doing a double 
backflip in midair and then gracefully landed on his feet.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Wow, 
that&#39;s incredible!  How long did it take you to teach him to do 
that?” said Nanami. Millie then put her hand on Nanami&#39;s right thigh, 
though Nanami didn&#39;t mind this touch at all.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Through 
years of practice. I haven&#39;t been able to get him to do that trick until 
recently,” said Millie as she lightly squeezed Nanami&#39;s firm leg. 
Nanami seemed to notice Millie&#39;s hand on her leg but didn&#39;t actually 
want it to stop. She blushed slightly as she looked at Millie&#39;s smooth 
silky legs that were exposed by her short skirt.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">So... 
you&#39;re catching up with everybody since the war ended?” said Nanami 
with slight tension in her voice.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Millie then took her hand off of 
Nanami&#39;s leg. “Oh, yeah. I just got back from meeting Rikimaru in 
Kaku. The two of us went to see Rina, Eillie, and Bolgan&#39;s show over 
in the Grasslands. I was passing through Kyaro and I remembered you 
and your brother were here so I stopped by.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Millie walked over to Bonaparte 
and picked him up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">You 
know Nanami, I&#39;ve been dying to see you for so long, these past two 
years. They felt like an eternity. I&#39;m staying at the Kyaro Inn and 
I really wanted to talk to you again. Can you meet me there later on 
tonight? I&#39;ve got a surprise for you.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">You 
want to meet me? I guess I can stop by after I close down the dojo for 
the night.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Oh 
gosh, thanks!” said Millie as she quickly squeezed Nanami into a hug. 
After their awkward embrace Millie looked Nanami straight in the eyes. 
“Alright, I&#39;ve gotta go and get ready.  I&#39;ll see you when you 
get there.” Millie then walked out of the dojo&#39;s front door, cutely 
waving goodbye to Nanami with Bonaparte in her arms.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami then stood in silence over 
the strange feeling she got over Millie&#39;s touches and felt a slight 
moistness in her panties. She remembered the last time she felt this 
way was toward a boy, but the last girl that made her feel this when 
she first laid eyes on Eillie and Rina two years ago. She was lost in 
thought as to what the surprise was going to be. She then put away her 
triple-rod, put out the lights in the dojo, walked out the front door, 
locking it behind her.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami left the Genkaku dojo at 
a late hour. The streets were lit by torches and the local tavern was 
bustling with activity of heavy drunkards drinking away their shame. 
She passed the noisy tavern and made her way to the local inn where 
Millie was staying. She sighed a breath of air as she was a bit nervous 
about going in. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">She walked up to the front desk 
with her hands cupped behind her back with an innocent smile towards 
the clerk at the desk.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Umm, 
hi. Is somebody named Millie staying here?” she said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Ah, 
you must be Nanami. That lady told me to expect you. She&#39;s staying in 
room number 103. Just knock when you&#39;re ready to meet her.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Sure, 
thanks.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami strolled her way over to 
the hallway to her right with slight nervousness in her body. It didn&#39;t 
take her long to finally reach room 103. She knocked on the door, after 
a few seconds she was greeted with a voice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Come 
on in, it&#39;s open.” said the voice behind the door. Nanami slowly opened 
the door, and the smell of eucalyptus scented incense filled her nostrils. 
She looked around and noticed some pink flower petals on the floor, 
they seemed to be set in a trail that led to an open doorway. Nanami 
followed the petals to the doorway to see a familiar figure wearing 
a blue robe, sipping some wine from a glass, laying on a bed, lit by 
several candles.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">You 
made it Nanami! I&#39;m so happy you made it,” said Millie. “Would you 
like a glass of Kanakan wine?”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Oh, 
um, sure. I&#39;ll try some.” said Nanami. Millie then poured some red 
liquid from a bottle into a small glass and then handed it off to the 
pink clad tomboy. She took a sip, which was strong enough to render 
her weak in the knees, and she sat down at the foot of the bed. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Do 
you like it?” asked Millie.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Oh, 
sure. It&#39;s fine. So... what did you want to see me for?”</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Well, 
I just wanted to talk in private. I wanted to know, do you have a boyfriend?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami then set her glass down 
and sighed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">No, 
not many people are attracted to me because they all think I&#39;m a &#39;tomboy&#39;,” 
said Nanami with a sad note in her voice.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Really?  
You must be lonely. I know I get that way because nobody finds a skilled 
magician like me likable,” she said as she took a sip from her glass. 
“You know, there are some people who like tomboys... if you know where 
to find them.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">I 
guess so,” said Nanami.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">The two girls sat in silence for 
a few moments casually sipping their drinks only to have Millie break 
the silence.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">I 
like tomboys, you know.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami nearly choked on her mouthful 
of wine when she heard Millie say those words. She didn&#39;t know whether 
to be flattered or worried.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Um, 
come again?”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">I 
love you, Nanami.” said Millie as she rested her hand on Nanami&#39;s 
leg, like in the dojo. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami felt stimulated again, like 
when they hugged in Genkaku&#39;s dojo. Nanami then rested her right hand 
on top of Millie&#39;s hand.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">You 
were all I could think about ever since I first met you, when you and 
your brother helped me save Bonaparte. I didn&#39;t just join the Dunan 
Army to help you and your brother, I joined because I wanted to be near 
you.”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Millie, 
I...”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">I&#39;m 
sorry, Nanami. I didn&#39;t mean to come on so strong.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami then put her other hand 
over Millie&#39;s shoulder in a supporting motion.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">No, 
no, it&#39;s okay, Millie... see, I&#39;ve been feeling... things... towards 
you since earlier today at the dojo. Well, I think I feel the same way 
towards you too.”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Millie&#39;s eyes widened, then she 
leaned her face towards Nanami&#39;s.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">I 
think I love you, too,” whispered Nanami.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami leaned into Millie and gave 
her a brief peck on the cheek. Millie smiled and blushed at the tomboy&#39;s 
pink lips pressing against her cheek. She then proceeded to kiss Nanami 
on the mouth.  First it was a simple joining of the lips, but then 
Millie forced her tongue into the other girl&#39;s mouth. While the two 
were engaged in the kiss Millie&#39;s hands proceeded to undo the ties on 
the back of Nanami&#39;s shirt. She then broke the kiss and proceeded to 
slip her shirt off over her head. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Are 
you sure you&#39;re okay with this Nanami?” said Millie as she dropped 
the pink shirt on the floor.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Just 
go easy on me,” said Nanami, crossing her arms as she felt slightly 
chilled with only a white bra covering her torso. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Millie nodded in agreement and 
undone the belt on her robe, causing it to fall to the floor, revealing 
Millie&#39;s body only covered with a blue bra and panties. Nanami proceeded 
to look up and down her slender body.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">You... 
have nice legs.” Nanami said, shyly. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Millie then ran her fingers through 
Nanami&#39;s brown hair and proceeded to kiss her again, this time while 
slowly undoing her sash on her green pants. While they wrestled tongues 
Millie proceeded to slip Nanami&#39;s pants down till they fell to the floor, 
revealing Nanami&#39;s pink panties, slightly wet from the excitement. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Millie then broke the kiss and 
started kissing Nanami&#39;s neck, then down to her chest. While she was 
kissing Nanami&#39;s breasts she unhooked her bra, letting it fall to the 
floor, revealing Nanami&#39;s bright pink nipples. Nanami moaned slightly 
while Millie kissed her exposed nipples. Nanami kissed the young magician&#39;s 
forehead while her nipples were being teased. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami moaned while feeling Millie&#39;s 
nimble tongue sweeping across her breasts and she brought her hands 
to Millie&#39;s back and unhooked Millie&#39;s blue bra, causing it to fall 
to the floor. Millie then blushed and decided to press her breasts against 
Nanami&#39;s; who&#39;s breasts were actually bigger.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami and Millie kissed again, 
as they deeply kissed they sat down together on the bed. Millie then 
slid her hand into the front of Nanami&#39;s panties, which felt wet to 
the touch, and the feeling of Millie&#39;s fingers down there only made 
them wetter. Millie&#39;s fingers began to explore Nanami&#39;s pussy, the touch 
on Nanami&#39;s most sensitive spot made her gasp loudly. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Oh 
my god, Millie! That feels wonderful,” whispered Nanami. Millie then 
took her hand out of Nanami&#39;s panties and licked the fluid off her fingers.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">You 
taste wonderful, Nanami.  I never tasted anything so sweet in my 
life.” </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Millie began to slowly kiss Nanami&#39;s 
body all the way down to her stomach. Nanami laid back when Millie&#39;s 
lips reached her stomach. Millie then pulled Nanami&#39;s panties off with 
her teeth, bringing them down to her shins, Nanami then slid them off 
all the way with her hands. Millie smiled at the sight of Nanami&#39;s exposed 
nether regions, she brought her face down to Nanami&#39;s bare crotch and 
dove her tongue into it. Nanami moaned in response and ran her fingers 
through Millie&#39;s hair.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Oh 
god, Millie, I love you,” whispered Nanami. Millie drove her tongue 
deeper into Nanami&#39;s tender zone, turning her moans into slight squeaks 
of pleasure. Millie loved the taste of Nanami&#39;s delicate pussy and licked 
for a few moments. Millie brought her head up and brought her face close 
to Nanami&#39;s. She then stood up and turned around.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier 
New">You&#39;re 
gonna like what you see now,” said Millie as she winked. She then 
started slowly sliding her blue panties off, bringing them down to her 
knees, bending over, exposing her moist pussy to her lover. Nanami smiled 
and crawled over on her hands and knees behind Millie. She brought her 
face close to Millie&#39;s exposed snatch. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Go 
on, don&#39;t be afraid,” said Millie. Nanami then inserted her finger 
into Millie&#39;s pussy. Millie moaned slightly at the feeling of Nanami&#39;s 
dainty finger. Nanami then licked the sticky fluid off her finger, she 
really liked how it tasted. Nanami then brought her face toward&#39;s Millie&#39;s 
exposed pussy and licked at her clit. Millie got hit with several feelings 
of pleasure, which brought her to her knees.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Mmm, 
yes, more! You&#39;re doing great,” moaned Millie.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">You 
taste so sweet,” said Nanami, with a trail of  fluid trickling 
down her lips. She licked Millie&#39;s snatch for a few moments until Millie 
finally got hit with a massive orgasm, which hit her like a bolt of 
lightning and sprayed Nanami&#39;s face with a torrent of girlcum. Millie 
then collapsed on the floor and was breathing really hard as if she 
ran a marathon. Nanami then crawled over to Millie and laid on top of 
her, the two girls then proceeded to make out.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami, 
what do you say we finish this little session of ours?” Millie whispered 
in Nanami&#39;s ear. Millie crawled to the other side of Nanami, wrapped 
her legs around Nanami&#39;s firm thighs, and pressed her wet snatch against 
Nanami&#39;s. Nanami smiled at the feeling of Millie&#39;s warm clit bumping 
against her own. Millie stretched out her hand, reaching for Nanami.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Take 
my hand, my sweet,” said Millie. Nanami reached out and grabbed Millie&#39;s 
outstretched hand. They pulled themselves close to each other and met 
face to face. Both girls then proceeded to rock their hips up and down, 
bumping clits together in a rhythmic fashion. They then started passionately 
kissing eachother, their tongues intermingling in a sea of saliva like 
their erect clits jousting and bumping in a large fit of ecstasy. They 
moaned louder and louder as time passed.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Oh 
Millie, I think I&#39;m about to come!” said Nanami.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Me 
to, Nanami, oh, come with me. We&#39;ll come together.” And just as quickly 
as it came it ended. Both girls hit the hardest orgasm they ever hit 
in their lives, it was like two champagne bottles being uncorked at 
the same time. The two girls collapsed, with Nanami on top of Millie, 
both were drenched in sweat and had a heartbeat loud enough to be felt 
through eachother&#39;s chests. Nanami then kissed Millie on the mouth, 
the taste of saliva and traces of Millie&#39;s girlcum in her mouth.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">That 
was wonderful, I love you, Nanami,” said Millie.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">As 
do I, Millie. You know, this is the first time I&#39;ve ever done this, 
with anybody. I never thought I&#39;d ever do that with another girl. I&#39;ve 
never thought of girls that way... except for you of course,” said 
Nanami winking at Millie.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Well, 
to be honest, you aren&#39;t the first girl I&#39;ve ever liked. I&#39;ve been liking 
girls for years. I&#39;ve had a crush on you since the first time I saw 
you two years ago.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Hehe, 
I guess I should be flattered. Not many people are attracted to me and 
my tomboyish nature.” </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">Nanami, 
will you please sleep here tonight? I don&#39;t wanna be lonely.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">For 
you, Millie, of course.” They both kissed again. They both then crawled 
up and into the bed, still naked, still holding eachother.  Then 
they fell asleep.</font></p>
