<pre>Damn, I hate Anita!!!!!!


Well.....I don&#39;t HATE her, but I sure don&#39;t like her, even though we&#39;re 
now fighting together.


When, I was recruited to head the Toran Rebublic segment of the 
Unification army, I was glad to back into the action.


However, I nearly went ballistic shortly after I arrived. I had walked 
into the Dunan castle bar for a drink, and I found my biggest rival, 
the sword bearing whore known as Anita, already slamming down a mug of 
sake.


To say that I was surprised would be an understatement. To say I was 
shocked was still an understatement. To say I was pretty damned mad 
would be the mother of understatements. Actually, I was fucking pissed 
to see her, and when she saw who I was, the feeling was mutual.


In fact, our reunion went something like this:


&quot;WHAT IN THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE, YOU BITCH!!!!!!!!&quot;


Well, that not exactly what we said, but you get the idea.


Anyway, we were pissed, and we were about to whip out our swords and 
spill each other guts. Thankfully, Viktor and Flik, who are two of the 
most levelheaded guys I know, stepped in between us, and prevented some 
serious bloodshed.


In retrospect, I&#39;m glad they did. In any case, I soon left, feeling 
like I should have had the word &quot;dumbass&quot; stapled to my head. I 
promptly marched up to my quarters, where I bitched at myself for 
losing control like an idiot.


That was our first meeting. Let&#39;s speed this up a little......



It was a hot summer day, and I was training the troops in sword drills, 
and they were going pretty smoothly. Just then, the sword bearing slut 
walks in.


My first reaction would have been to give her a glare that would given 
most people third degree burns, but I had to be professional in front 
of the troops, so I plastered a smile on my face and asked her if she 
had anything she needed.


Her answer was something like:

&quot;Why don&#39;t we give them a demonstration?&quot;

I thought about her question, and three things came to mind:


1. Most of the soldiers were so poorly trained, they couldn&#39;t slice the 
broad side of a 9 x 5 pile of warm shit.

2. A sword fight would give them a little experience.

3. If me and her were going to kill each other, at least we could make 
it educational.



With those three things in mind, I had the floor of the training dojo 
cleared so we could duel. Once that was done, I looked at the recruits, 
barked at them to &quot;take notes&quot;, then we proceeded to beat the crap out 
of each other.


We slashed, we parried, we dodged, we used our Rune techniques, we 
basically gave the neophytes a BIG lesson in kicking ass.


This went on for quite a while, until we had tapped out of that 
ridiculously short supply of elixer called &quot;energy&quot;. We eventually 
called a draw, then took a bow, and left the room.


As we both started to leave, we could both see that the other generals 
had been in attendance, and they were trying to hide looks of relief.


For once, Anita and I shared annoyance that everyone thought we were 
still trying to kill each other. However, our bad moods were put on 
hold by our hunger, which pretty much threatened to drag us both into 
an alley and make us it&#39;s bitch if we didn&#39;t feed it.


Sighing, we both headed for the Cafe.


When we arrived, I found that my favorite, ice cream, had already been 
left for me. However, it wasn&#39;t a small bowl, it was practically a 
cauldron.


When we got to the table, we were handed two spoons, given an apology 
that none of the other bowls were washed, and left without a word.


I was about to partake of my favorite food, but I sure wasn&#39;t 
happyhaving to share with Anita.


Hoveever, that hadn&#39;t served to stop her from eating. In fact, she had 
already finished two scoops by the time I joined in.


I was determined to show her up, and I started on the ice cream as 
well.


Pretty soon, that entire cauldron was empty, prompting raised eyebrows 
from everyone.


Anyway, after we finished dinner, both us relized we needed a bath. We 
both got a change of clothes, then we headed for the baths.


When we got there, we undressed. As we got into the water, I couldn&#39;t 
resist smirking as I saw the result that age had had on me.


However, I couldn&#39;t resist getting jealous looking at Anita. Even 
though I had the advantage when it came to looks, she had breasts a 
full cup size larger than mine, and she was more curvaceous than 
myself. I suppresed a snarl, then I went back to bathing myself.


Unfortunetly, Anita had seen my jealous examination of her assets, and 
she did her best to piss me off, mostly by flaunting her ample chest 
and sticking her tongue out at me.


I was about to flip her the bird in reply, but then, the cliche gods, 
or something like that, made me drop the soap.


I bent down to get the soap, and that&#39;s when Anita popped my ass with 
the rag. Instantly, I whipped around, the fires of hell burning in my 
eyes as my anger reached the deranged and insane level.


As I came up out of the water, Anita had figured out that she pissed me 
off, and she tried to smooth it over with a weak, half assed apology.


Big mistake.


Next thing she knew, she had about 170 pounds of pissed white female 
tackle her. She went flying right out of the bath, landing flat on her 
back.


I would&#39;ve laughed, but since she wasn&#39;t moving, I was worried that she 
wasn&#39;t breathing anymore. Instantly, I was by her side, breathing air 
into her lungs. As I was trying to revive her, I was really glad that 
Sheena, our resident hentai, with a dick for brains I might add, wasn&#39;t 
here.


While I was doing this, I felt something very pleasurable. I didn&#39;t 
enjoy it so much though, when I realized that her tongue was swirling 
around in my mouth.


And I liked it.


Instantly, I backed away, and as I did, I heard Anita say, &quot;You always 
were a crappy kisser.....&quot;


That did it. In that moment, my irritation and my hormones took 
control, and I pressed my lips against hers in a full force, bruising 
kiss. While I was sucking her face off, I managed to convince my 
modesty that I was simply showing her up.


&quot;Yeah.....right......&quot; , is what you&#39;re probably thinking. 	
 

You&#39;re damn right.


Anyway, I was sucking face with my archrival, and both us had no way in 
hell that we could deny we were enjoying it. However, common sense, and 
a sudden draft, made us stop.


As we got up, we took a long look into each other&#39;s faces as we tried 
to figure out what the hell was wrong with us. Even though we still had 
the same &quot;friendly factor&quot; of cats and dogs, neither of us could deny 
that we had an &quot;attraction&quot;.


To make a long story short, even though we had just figured this out, 
we were feeling a little embarassed. We got dressed and prepared to 
leave.


However, just as I was about to go, she spoke up, &quot; So...do you think 
that we could......&quot;


Even though I felt horny enough to screw a bedpost, I quickly replied, 
&quot;No.&quot;


She retorted, &quot;Afraid?&quot;


She had hit the right nerve. I whipped around, grabbed the back of her 
head, and gave her a full force french kiss. As I did, she returned the 
favor and started kissing me back.


This went on for a while, then we broke off for air. As I did, I asked 
her the &quot;question&quot;.


&quot;My room, or yours?&quot;


Without any hesitation, she replied, &quot;Yours.&quot;


After she said that, we broke off into a sprint for my room. I bolted 
the door, then I jumped on the bed right into Anita&#39;s arms.

...

...

...


What?  You want details? 

Well, I&#39;m not telling you everything...but I suppose this couldn&#39;t 
hurt.......

I had screwed Anita all night long, and we were both exhausted.  As we 
lay in each other&#39;s arms, we made a few observations. For the sake of 
convenience, I&#39;ll put it in script form:


Her: Damn, my tongue is sore......

Me: (dryly) Well, you decided to screw me at 90 miles an hour....

Her: Could you blame me?

Me: No.

Her: Are you hungry?

Me: (rolling eyes) Your hormones should know that by now.....

Her: True. You&#39;re still a bitch though.

Me: Ditto.

Her: I gotta get some breakfast.

Me: Me too.

Her: (getting dressed and preparing to leave) Coming back tonight?

Me: (doing the same) What the hell........

Her: I&#39;ll bring the whipped cream.

Me: And I&#39;ll bring the handcuffs.


(We leave)



And that&#39;s my story. I don&#39;t really know why I told you this, but it 
sure makes me feel better.


I still hate her though.........


THE END

============================================================================

Author&#39;s Notes- I normally do not write yuri, despite being male and 
having the usual raging hormone problems that come along with that.

Actually, I was playing Suikoden one day, and I saw how the characters 
of Anita and Valeria didn&#39;t get along.

I took that as the base for my story, and this fic is the result.

This originally was a down and dirty, kinky as all hell, yuri lemon, 
but I had to cut that out so fanfiction.net wouldn&#39;t kick me off.

In retrospect, I&#39;m sorta glad I did.

P.S.- If anyone has written a really good (and long) Suikoden, Ranma 
1/2, Tenchi Muyo, Final Fantasy, or Star Trek Humor\Romance, (lemon or 
non-lemon) I would be glad to read it, and I would review it.

P.P.S.- I would be honored beyond measure if I was shown a very good, 
andvery long, Ranma\Kodachi romance, lemon or non lemon. If anyone 
writes one, I will personally make it my first priority to read and 
review it.</pre>
