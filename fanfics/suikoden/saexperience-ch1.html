<h1>Millie & Meg's Radical ShoujoAi Experience</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../suikoden/index.html">Suikoden</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrtoasty.html">Mr. Toasty</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I know what you&#39;re thinking. Two doesn&#39;t come after three (sequel-wise). 
Why make a sequel to a story that involves characters from a game that 
comes right after the setting of the very sequel itself? Why make these 
characters blissfully self-aware about all of them, even though most are 
in foreign lands or not even born yet? The solution is simple.

But you&#39;ll never learn what it is. Ha ha.



It was one of those days where it seemed everybody in North Window 
Castle had nothing to do. As odd as it sounded, what with all the means 
of entertainment and the cluster of characters as different as clouds in 
the sky, one would think that they&#39;d have something better to 
do-anything, really. But no, no, nothing was going on-or rather, if 
something were going on, it would be so unworthy of notice that 
outsiders would brush it aside and inquire when the next activity of 
significance took place. Those Nothings were what made North Window 
Castle so difficult to live in: when people got into Nothing, 
particularly two girls of outstanding character (and that is telling it 
gently), the things that happened during and afterwards constituted 
insanity. Literal insanity. The local asylum saw business booming.

Boom. ...(cough)

Upon one of those days, Millie and Meg (and Bonaparte), the two 
mischievous pixies mentioned not long ago (see above paragraph), decided 
to make something remarkable out of their Nothing time. North Window was 
about as interesting as cold mud, and tourism would spike downwards if 
things and steps were not taken (Hoi was later heard crying, &quot;Hey! 
Somebody&#39;s taken my things and steps!&quot; and ironically called the police, 
who arrested him). As in most shoujo magazines and programs, it was up 
to two adorable young girls with special powers to save the day.

&quot;Hi Millie!&quot; addressed Meg.

&quot;Hi Meg!&quot; addressed Millie, and the plot thickened. &quot;What&#39;cha doin&#39; 
today?&quot; was the next question asked.

&quot;Oh, you know. Fixing Gadget and stuff. Oh! I took a bath and found a 
hamburger!&quot; Now you must understand, with such a dull air being 
breathed, it was very difficult finding things to get excited about. 
Millie gasped and wished she had been through such adventures.

&quot;Did it have ketchup?&quot;

&quot;Yeah! Oh, wait-were you talking about the bath or the burger?&quot;

&quot;Um... both.&quot;

&quot;Me too!&quot; laughed Meg, but the scary thing was that she was serious. 
Millie laughed too, and then told Meg she was going on a walk with 
Bonaparte, and it was then, right then, when the girls created their 
mischief.

&quot;Say, it&#39;s boring out here!&quot; said Meg. &quot;I mean, it&#39;s boring all over, 
and in general: all the way through, ya know? It&#39;s getting to where 
finding a burger is an event. We really need to do something to spice 
things up.&quot;

&quot;Oh! How about we put hot peppers in all the food?&quot;

&quot;Nah, did that last week.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Ah! We could apply for tenure!&quot;

&quot;Two weeks ago.&quot;

&quot;Darn.&quot; Millie frowned and was stumped. Surely, though the two girls had 
caused every conceivable bit of trouble they could imagine, their minds 
were not exhausted yet. Unfortunately (for everyone else in North Window 
Castle), this was true, and their faces both shined with revelation. Of 
course!

&quot;Of course!&quot; repeated Meg giddily.

&quot;But the narrator said that...&quot;

&quot;Never mind! We have to promote rampant shoujo-ai activities!&quot;

&quot;Why? I thought that was already done, twice!&quot;

&quot;Ah, but isn&#39;t the third time the charm?&quot; The Trickster had a point 
there. Millie smiled broadly and thought it a lovely idea in spite of 
the Damoclesean threat of kicking a horse when it was down. Promoting 
hot girl-on-girl action was all fine and fair in the original game, when 
few cared either way (although there was a powerful Alen and Grenseal 
base), and in the third it was blindingly obvious, but who in their 
right mind...

Oh. Perhaps that is not a good phrase to use, considering the stars of 
this story.

&quot;I think Riou and Jowy have had enough time in the spotlight!&quot; said 
Millie, even though Riou had spent more time with Eilie than he had with 
anyone, even Nanami. &quot;It&#39;s our turn now!&quot;

&quot;Right! We&#39;re the only reasonable couple that could ever pass as shoujo 
love in this adventure, so we&#39;re obviously the only ones capable of 
promoting its welfare, establishment, and growth!&quot;

&quot;(Ahem!)&quot; came a loud cough from behind. Millie and Meg went &quot;Eep!&quot;, 
froze, and turned around to face Valeria and Anita. Their skills at 
eavesdropping were laudable.

&quot;The only reasonable one?&quot; parroted Anita cattily. The younger girls 
nearly turned blue.

&quot;Uh, well...&quot;

&quot;People seem to like cute girls together... well, I mean, the 
shoujo-shippers do...&quot;

&quot;Not that older women aren&#39;t appealing!&quot; blurted Meg suddenly, saving 
her friend.

&quot;Yeah! It&#39;s just that... we&#39;re more expected to do this job!&quot;

&quot;And you two seem to fight a lot. We&#39;re very good friends.&quot;

&quot;Yes. The best.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re forgetting the rule,&quot; said Valeria dustily. She then 
recited: &quot;One of the chief rules of romance is that, quote, &#145;If any two 
characters appear to have some distaste or lengthened disagreement 
towards each other, they are automatically considered able for 
relationship status, in spite of any previous engagement, endeavor, or 
vow&#39;. Now, are you girls going to tell me that everything we know about 
that rule is wrong?&quot;

Millie and Meg couldn&#39;t answer at first. They stood there, frozen and 
mute, knowing full well that the older swordfighters had a point.

&quot;Um, yes?&quot; squeaked Meg. Valeria sighed.

&quot;Look, we don&#39;t want to do this. Neither of us are like that. We 
actually support the shounen-ai movement.&quot;

&quot;Ack, enemies!&quot; spat Millie. Bonaparte suddenly leaped forward, grew to 
a gigantic size, and swallowed both of the women whole. He gulped them 
down and squeaked back to his normal size, leaving Millie and Meg 
astonished to a new degree. The dull day certainly was becoming very 
postmodern in its drawl.

&quot;That was... unique,&quot; managed the Trickster. Millie agreed.

&quot;Yeah... Listen, let&#39;s just move on before our senses take over and tell 
us to stop this silly game and start ogling Futch.&quot;

&quot;You got it!&quot; Meg let out a cheer and followed her companion (and 
Bonaparte), since she was by far not one to heed her senses. Allowing 
any logic into their activity would be just... stupid. And there&#39;d also 
be no story.

But since Bonaparte ate the only other people who could ever pass for a 
shoujo-ai couple in Suikoden 2 (and still be considered reasonable), 
their job ended up being very hard. Combined, the two could round off a 
list of women with the potential, possibility, and remote 
well-maybe-if-they-were-drunk-or-desperate-enough conceivability of 
being listed as a card-carrying Communist. Erm, lesbian. Although in the 
1950s, they may as well have been synonymous. Blame McCarthy and 
Scooby-Doo.

Anyway, they decided to think like boys for once and... whoops. Start 
over.

Anyway, they decided to think like boys for once and... you know, I&#39;ll 
get it soon. Just gimme a second.

Anyway, they decided...

Screw it.

Millie and Meg consulted men of able body and mind to assist them in 
their social venture, since they seemed best-trained in the art of 
Sapphic appreciation and discovery, after the Sapphics themselves. Being 
very feminine women who could only pass off as mildly tomboyish, they 
could not hope to think as a man and thus, the consultation was the 
closest thing they could get to. Besides, Richmond was as bored as they 
were.

&quot;So ya want me to find out who in this township could be, eh, on the 
other side of the fence, eh?&quot; he said, trying to do his best imitation 
of Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogard. He ended up sounding like 
Carrot Top.

&quot;No,&quot; replied Meg, &quot;we just wanna know which of the girls in this castle 
could be supporters for the shoujo-ai movement!&quot; Richmond chuckled. He 
knew that they were on the same track, they just used different trains. 
He sucked on a cigar and flipped his coin.

&quot;All right, I&#39;ll do it. I always work best when I&#39;m paid up front, ya 
know.&quot; Richmond grinned, but because Bonaparte looked very hungry that 
moment, he decided to give the youngsters a discount price and scurried 
off without haggling (thus waiving his right to tenure). Millie and Meg 
shared a big Magical Girl smile, clasped hands, and jumped up and down 
for a few seconds. Sheena would&#39;ve loved it.

&quot;Our movement will proceed as planned!&quot; screamed Meg. &quot;I mean... this is 
so cool! We&#39;re gonna beat up those shounen-ai kings!&quot;

&quot;Whatever you said, I like it!&quot; agreed Millie. They then forgot what 
they were celebrating and decided to wander around aimlessly, thus 
excusing themselves of appearances for the next few scenes.

Obviously, this is the part which switches to Richmond&#39;s investigations.

......No, you read this story because of Millie and Meg, or else you too 
support the &quot;movement&quot;, or you clicked the wrong story and meant to read 
that one with Borus and Percival. See previous entry. YOU ARE READING A 
SUIKODEN 2 STORY. Just checking; you never really know. Are we all 
clear? I know this part&#39;s not funny at all; please bear with me as many 
better jokes will come at you and not bother to wipe their feet before 
entering. Bring yams.

Richmond completed his investigation the next day, and of course, Millie 
and Meg forgot they had ever sent him on any assignment.

&quot;We forgot we sent you on any assignment!&quot; said Meg. Richmond showed her 
proof of their contract and cited quotations he knew would incriminate 
their blurry memory.

&quot;If you&#39;ll clearly read this-&quot;

HEY! WHAT&#39;S THAT BEHIND YOU!

SLURP!

&quot;Oh my god, Bonaparte ate Richmond!&quot;

&quot;You base turd!&quot; Millie and Meg quickly got over their shock and 
suddenly realized their whole purpose of being and/or the plot of the 
week.

&quot;Oh yeah! Our movement! It must not die! We shall overcome!&quot;

&quot;Here are Richmond&#39;s notes,&quot; said Millie quietly as she noticed said 
dropped stack of papers. She picked them up and shared them with Meg, 
who increased shoujo-ai activity in this story by 22 percent as she 
leaned over her friend&#39;s shoulder. Millie blushed as she realized whose 
chin rested upon her shrugging machine, and turned around awkwardly. 
They stared at each other (34 percent if you&#39;re keeping count), 
swallowed, stammered, and had a few good seconds of quiet. Forty 
percent!

&quot;Who&#39;s on the list?&quot; asked Meg, ruining the moment. The percentages 
crashed and crawled into a corner where they curled up into a fetal 
position and whined themselves to sleep as the story returned to 
business-as-usual. Millie cleared her throat.

&quot;Well, Hannah and Oulan are suspected because they&#39;re very butch and 
have a good chance of being completely dyke. Nanami and Wakaba are &quot;cute 
tomboys&quot; who stand a good but not great chance; Jeane and Raura are 
actually next in line after Valeria and Anita in terms of Sapphic 
probability, and Emelia is on the list because a female NPC in Greenleaf 
Academy is infatuated with her. Everyone else has only slight 
possibilities, ranging from Ayda&#39;s primitive forest maiden status to 
Eilie&#39;s severe lack of potential relationship with Riou. It says here 
that both Tengaar and Yoshino could do better, Sierra could look &#145;cute&#39; 
with another girl, Rina may be bi-curious, Annalee and Karen may still 
be in the closet, Lorelai has &#145;masculine tenure&#39;, and Viki...&quot;

There was an understandable awkward silence.

&quot;Complete impossible potential,&quot; they both groused at the same time. 
Millie sighed.

&quot;Let&#39;s face it. Viki is cuter than both of us but she would be awful in 
any relationship. She has the brain of a starfish and the romance of 
tree bark. The closest she ever got-&quot;

&quot;Was &#145;accidentally&#39; teleporting into the men&#39;s baths,&quot; finished Meg, who 
had seen Viki&#39;s &quot;mishaps&quot; firsthand-many, many times. Millie raised 
intrigued eyebrows. &quot;Look,&quot; explained her friend, &quot;Viki ported into the 
men&#39;s bath in Toran Castle the most whenever Luc or Master McDohl were 
there. One time she stayed a full five minutes in the tub, clothes on 
and everything. Another she actually-&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I wanna hear the end of this story!&quot; shrieked Millie 
helplessly. &quot;Let&#39;s just get on with this investigation!&quot; The girls 
agreed on this, and since they seemed to have a good idea of who was &quot;on 
their side&quot; and who was not, they set out to prove themselves correct.

Now it should not take a genius to figure out how well they fared.

I&#39;ll humor you anyway.

Now as it turned out, Richmond&#39;s investigations were rarely wrong, but 
on the other hand, they were rarely accurate (if that makes any sense. 
If it does, you are too smart to be reading this). Hannah was quite the 
butch, but the way she handled children suggested she would make a great 
mother, and her love of fine cuisine suggested a connoisseur&#39;s life-and 
her sword was really not that big. It also turned out that many people 
in the Nameless Lands dressed like her, women included, and in fact she 
was the girliest one in her whole tribe. This last revelation was, of 
course, more upsetting than it needed to be.

Oulan seemed a more reasonable choice. Men found her very sexy and a 
little easier to talk to due to her being more open and inclined to 
speak using more than monosyllabic sentences. Her trademark was being 
the bodyguard of other women, which must&#39;ve flashed flags for Richmond 
as he performed his art. Yet unbelievable as it seemed, Oulan was more 
straight than most of the married people in the castle, and casually 
admitted to having &quot;many fine moments together with lord strategist 
Shu&quot;. This topped the &quot;Hannah Discovery&quot; in terms of unsettling news.

Nanami and Wakaba were in the divinely questionable area: the category 
of people who could &quot;swing either way if the wind tipped them hard 
enough&quot; (also, people who used quote marks when they really weren&#39;t 
needed). One was indefatigably infatuated with Camus; the other had a 
sharp like of cheese. And if those weren&#39;t pieces of credible evidence, 
Millie and Meg could never dismiss the FACT that both martial artists 
spoke of &quot;liking male people&quot; together more than &quot;once&quot;. Then again, 
they wore comfortable sandals, and they had tenure.

And as embarrassing as it was, as it turned out, Jeane and Raura really 
were &quot;just friends&quot;. Millie and Meg learned that the hard way.

Five minutes earlier...

&quot;Jeane, are you and Raura friends?&quot;

&quot;Why, yes... we are.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;

&quot;Are you really sure?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I am.&quot;

&quot;Are you really, really, really sure?&quot;

&quot;No doubts.&quot; That had settled it.

Now everything else involved murky territory. The remaining women were 
listed as &quot;possible, not certain&quot; by Richmond, and since so many before 
them expressed desires not to support the shoujo-ai movement (some had, 
in fact, taken the opposite road, and proved delicious to a certain 
groundhog), these &quot;questionable ones&quot; were the only hope left for our 
heroines, at least until Suikoden 3 came along. Meg and Millie didn&#39;t 
let disappointment or fatigue wear them down, and resolved their wills 
to be even stronger as they pressed on. Also they kissed a few times to 
keep your attention and to keep at least one little tiny percent from 
running away.

&quot;Me? Interested in women?&quot; Emelia chuckled politely and removed her 
glasses, somehow keeping her hotness in spite of it. She then blushed 
and answered, &quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;I knew it! There had to be somebody in North Window Castle! Odds 
favored us!&quot;

&quot;But please don&#39;t get your hopes up,&quot; warned the librarian. &quot;Remember, 
the ratio of gay women vs. gay men in any industry is one for every 
gazillion. This is most noteworthy in fan-fiction, anime, video games, 
television, politics, sports...well, not sports, but you get the idea. 
Anyway, I think I may be the only one you find, at least until the next 
evil empire comes along to force 108 perfect strangers to live together 
in the same place.&quot;

&quot;(When she tells it like that,)&quot; whispered Meg to Millie, &quot;(she makes it 
sound like a great potential reality television show!)&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re right,&quot; resumed Emelia, &quot;I have a taste for ladies. Why, 
last week, I invited Leona, woman NPC 8, Teresa, and Oulan to my chamber 
for bridge, tea, and underwear pillow fights.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Emelia in a laugh. &quot;I&#39;m just pulling your leg! Sorry. I&#39;m 
hopelessly attracted to Shu.&quot;

&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; Meg and Millie screamed viciously, and at that 
very same moment, Bonaparte leaped into the air, took a huge breath, and 
swallowed Miss Emelia and the entire library. The two young girls stood 
gaping as the little pet squeaked back to its mistress, looking no 
bigger than before.

&quot;Wow, how does he do that?&quot; managed Meg. Millie shook her head.

&quot;If I knew, do you think I&#39;d be here!&quot;

Eventually, the day winded down and their hunt became utterly fruitless. 
Millie and Meg found to their unusual disbelief that every woman in 
North Window Castle &amp; Township was hopelessly straight and thought 
nothing of the shoujo-ai movement, save its opposition. Whenever a girl 
championed the notion of hot man-love, they were violently (and perhaps 
ironically) sucked down by Bonaparte, leaving one less in the way. Now 
Millie and Meg were extremely tolerant, and in their clearer, more sane 
moments, they would have gushed over how good one young man would look 
with another (i.e. Futch, Riou, Luc, Sasuke, Templeton, et. al.), but 
Bonaparte was hungry and Machiavellian in his movement.

The ends (swallow beloved female character) justified the means (meal 
plus no yaoi).

Really, at the end of the day, all the two magical girls had were each 
other, Bonaparte, and a world that had yet to be swallowed by any of 
them. Well... Teresa remained, but only because Lucia had taken an 
unusual interest in her. In what could only foreshadow her 
&quot;relationship&quot; with Chris Lightfellow 15 years and one video game later, 
Teresa and Lucia became an unofficial couple and spent the rest of their 
days (in the second game) convincing everyone. Ironically, the most 
homosexual man in the whole game (Jowy) later became the father of the 
most homosexual women&#39;s (that&#39;s Lucia) son, who in turn inherited his 
parent&#39;s indecisiveness. But at least he had tenure.

&quot;I guess we shouldn&#39;t have meddled into affairs that weren&#39;t ours,&quot; 
remarked Millie of their adventures. &quot;I mean, after all, if somebody 
wants to support something, they should-and they shouldn&#39;t let two 
magical girls and their hungry sidekick influence their decision in any 
way. So what if there&#39;s more yaoi than yuri? So what if girls are 
virtually ignored, or worsened, in man-love fanfiction? So what if you 
can&#39;t judge a lesbian just because she wears the skin of an animal or if 
her glasses make her look hot? So what if two people who wanted to kill 
each other five minutes ago are now having hot sex?&quot;

Both of the girls moped and crumbled to the ground in defeat.

&quot;It&#39;s no use pretending we don&#39;t care,&quot; sighed Meg. &quot;Let&#39;s face it: the 
shoujo-ai movement is dead.&quot;

&quot;But at least we took down hundreds of innocent lives and ideals with 
it,&quot; remarked Millie, keeping her optimism. It spread to Meg, who rose 
with a jump.

&quot;Yeah! We did! And ya know what? We still have each other, and as long 
as there are two, the fight can go on!&quot;

&quot;Absolutely!&quot; Millie stood to her feet through the help of her friend, 
and embraced her lovingly as Bonaparte looked on. They smiled at each 
other warmly, and since it only made sense to have intimacy in a story 
like this, the two girls brought themselves towards each other, hugged 
again, and went for the kill.

&quot;Oooh, a hamburger!&quot; Unfortunately, Meg bent down at the wrong time.

SMACK!

&quot;Ow! I chipped my tooth!&quot;

&quot;Ow! You bumped right into my head!&quot; Bonaparte suddenly had more than he 
could take, and with a big huge gigantic gulp, he swallowed all of North 
Window Castle, then the continent of Dunan, and finally ate the entire 
world. Everything got sucked down into his bottomless throat until there 
was nothing left for our beautiful heroines to stand on.

&quot;Oh no!&quot; shrieked Millie. &quot;Bonaparte ate the entire universe!&quot;

&quot;Oh, Bonaparte!&quot; laughed Meg. &quot;You&#39;re always causing complete 
destruction and cataclysm somehow! But we love you anyway!&quot; The two 
girls laughed very badly, leaving Bonaparte to grumble and wonder what 
the heck they were talking about. All he ever wanted of the deal was a 
sandwich. He didn&#39;t even get tenure.

And that&#39;s why this story came third.

Because if it came second, there&#39;d be nothing for Chris and her friends 
to work with.

If that makes any sense.
