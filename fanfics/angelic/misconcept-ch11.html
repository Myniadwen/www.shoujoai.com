The darkness outside seemed to seep in through the walls. Misaki was 
feeling uncomfortable with herself. Receiving a message from your Mother 
that the love of her life wasn&#39;t actually the love of her life was, in 
the least of ways, disturbing. Why her Mother would say something like 
that, Misaki didn&#39;t know. Her thoughts were interrupted as Hatoko 
entered the room with dinner.

&quot;Misaki-chan, dinner time,&quot; informed Hatoko as she set two bowls of udon 
noodle soup on the floor. Misaki didn&#39;t respond and Hatoko sat down next 
to her. &quot;Misaki-chan... Are you worried that what we have now... is a 
phase?&quot;

&quot;I am,&quot; replied Misaki in a distant voice as she gazed at the floor.

&quot;Don&#39;t you trust yourself?&quot; Hatoko replied sincerely. Misaki looked up 
to find that Hatoko was staring at her like she was the only valuable 
thing left on the face of the Earth. If love and endearment could kill, 
Misaki would have been floating with the angels already.

The question took Misaki by suprise, but at seeing Hatoko&#39;s eyes she 
couldn&#39;t seem to look away anymore. Misaki&#39;s mind clouded over. She 
couldn&#39;t think. She couldn&#39;t move. She couldn&#39;t even blink. But even 
with such hinderence, such confusion, Misaki opened her mouth.

&quot;I love you, Hatoko-chan,&quot; and with that Misaki fell forward towards 
Hatoko, into her waiting arms. Misaki&#39;s foot dragged along the floor in 
a sweeping motion as her body shifted directions, knocking over her bowl 
of soup in the process. She didn&#39;t even glance to see the effects of the 
accident, she was already crying once more.

&quot;Why does it have to be so difficult?&quot; Misaki sobbed, pulling at 
Hatoko&#39;s nightgown and burying herself into it. Hatoko wrapped her arms 
around Misaki, but for once didn&#39;t know what to say. The now cold soup 
that had been spilled on the floor glimmered in the pale light, and 
Hatoko stared at it over Misaki&#39;s shoulder.

Several minutes passed and Misaki couldn&#39;t seem to muster any more 
tears. Hatoko tilted her chin up.

&quot;Don&#39;t you trust yourself?&quot; Hatoko asked again. Misaki shifted her head 
slightly as if to look away, but Hatoko held her firmly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Misaki said at last, jerking her head away and back in 
to Hatoko&#39;s chest. Her arms wrapped tighter around Hatoko.

&quot;Don&#39;t say that. I know you trust yourself. Look at what happened today! 
You came to my rescue by voicing what you believe in! I think its 
wonderful... and I don&#39;t think that there could have been anyway for you 
do that if you didn&#39;t trust yourself. Misaki... You are a strong person. 
I know you love me. We love each other. More then we ever thought was 
possible. How could something like this ever be broken apart? I mean, 
really?&quot; Hatoko finished, forcing Misaki to look her in the eyes once 
more.

&quot;Misaki, look within your soul... Can you doubt the love we share for 
each other?&quot; Hatoko asked.

&quot;I could never... I can&#39;t even imagine life without you anymore...&quot; 
Misaki sighed softly after a few moments of thought. &quot;I can&#39;t even seem 
to survive without you now.&quot;

&quot;It is the same for me. And I could never leave you aswell.&quot; Hatoko 
replied, stroking Misaki&#39;s hair slowly. Hatoko reached down to the floor 
to grab her bowl of soup, which was still warm. She nudged Misaki with 
her free hand, bringing the bowl in front of her.

&quot;Please,&quot; Hatoko asked gently, &quot;it will make you feel better. Nothing 
will ever become between us.&quot;

Misaki nodded slowly, beginning to reach for the small bowl. Hatoko 
moved it to her lips before Misaki could touch the bowl, and Misaki 
understood. She let her arms fall to her sides without any further 
attempt to stop Hatoko from feeding her yet again.

Talking small gulps at the provision of Hatoko, no sounds came from 
either of them. But silence was not warranted as the wind began to blow 
against the room&#39;s outer wall. When the warm and comforting soup was no 
more, Hatoko set the bowl down upon its original place.

&quot;Hatoko-chan, you haven&#39;t eaten,&quot; Misaki started, &quot;Let me go get you 
something...&quot;

But Hatoko wouldn&#39;t hear of it. She turned Misaki around so that her 
head rested upon her lap facing up.

&quot;No, this night is for you. I don&#39;t want you worrying. I&#39;ll stay here. 
No worrying tonight.&quot; Hatoko said reassuringly. Misaki practically 
melted, sinking deeper into speechless comfort.

&quot;I have a story for you, Misaki-chan. Once upon a time there was a bunny 
named Usako, and that bunny was still young and small, just a year old 
or so. Usako was always a nice little bunny. Anyways, at this age, any 
creature is curious, and so the bunny decided to go out exploring one 
day. Usako told her mother that she was going out to play, and the bunny 
left their little hole in the ground to begin the grand exploration.

&quot;After bouncing down the dirt path for a little while, Usako heard 
voices off in the bushes and decided to see who it was. Peeking through, 
Usako saw several other bunnies wrestling in the mud. They were guy 
bunnies. Usako looked around a bit more through the grasses to find that 
some girl bunnies were watching the guys roll around and point fingers 
at the macho ones. Usako didn&#39;t understand. Her mother had mentioned 
before that she wouldn&#39;t understand, for some reason of another, but 
this was the first time she had seen such behavior of her peers.

&quot;Just as Usako was about to continue exploring, one of the female 
bunnies noticed her. &#39;Hey look! It&#39;s Usako! She doesn&#39;t think watching 
guys is fun at all! Look at her! She thinks they&#39;re disgusting!&#39; shouted 
the girl bunny. All eyes turned towards Usako. &#39;Prove me wrong, Usako.&#39;

&quot;Usako didn&#39;t know what to say. Why was her old friend being mean to 
her? What did she do wrong? In any case, Usako didn&#39;t know. She was 
scared now, and she ran away. Farther down the path, anything to escape 
those bunnies whe used to call her friends. Usako ran and ran, only to 
find that she had gone to far into the brush. She was lost now in a 
place she had never visited... but strangely, she recognized it. That&#39;s 
right, it was the dead berry bush that her mother had told her about. It 
was giant! A great maze of thorns and brambles!

&quot;Being all alone now, and scared out of her wits, Usako began to cry. 
She worried about being eaten, and about never finding her way home, and 
about her old friends, and those dirty males... What if she did go back? 
What would happen to her? Usako didn&#39;t know, and she found herself not 
wanting to know.

&quot;And then, as if by miracle, a bunny angel came down from above with a 
little haol on its head and little bunny wings on its back. Usako was a 
bit taken a back by the sudden appearance, but knew from tales that this 
was an angel bunny, and that they were always nice and understanding. It 
said to Usako, in its soft voice, &#39;Usako-chan... There is something you 
already probably know, but I want to help you understand it. There are 
many bunnies in this world, but every so often there are a couple that 
aren&#39;t like the others. These few are always female bunnies and...&#39; the 
angel bunny was cut off. &#39;I know I&#39;m wierd...&#39; Usako interjected. &#39;It&#39;s 
okay... Let me finish please.&#39; Usako nodded.

&quot;&#39;There is someone in this world for you, Usako-chan. They are like you. 
They are scared and lonely, but they are always trying to seek you. You 
began exploring today because, whether you know it or not, you are 
looking for that other bunny. Now, this isn&#39;t a regular bunny. Like I 
said they are like you. And, like you, they need you to survive, because 
without each other, neither of you will survive. Loneliness can kill 
these special bunnies. Be careful, Usako-chan. Remember this: Once you 
find that other bunny, you will be forever happy, forever young and 
spirited, forever together. And then, as the bunnies you called your 
friends die, you will realize that you and your soul bunny are more 
special then any other bunny alive. Remember this, and don&#39;t be scared 
when it happens. Take care, Usako-chan.&#39; And with that, the angel 
disappeared into thin air.&quot; Hatoko was ready to continue, but a 
grumbling in her stomach could be heard.

&quot;Hatoko-chan... You&#39;re hungry! It&#39;s a wonderful story, and I want you to 
continue... But... Please eat something first...&quot; Misaki started to move 
to left Hatoko get up, but she found Hatoko had inched up behind her, 
wrapping arms around her abdomen.

&quot;I would rather die then let you be jostled right now. I have never 
known anything like tonight... I don&#39;t want to loose it to something so 
trivial as hunger. Misaki, please be mine tonight... Please don&#39;t worry, 
please don&#39;t fret... Please, be with me.&quot; Hatoko rubbed her head against 
Misaki&#39;s shoulder affectionatly, her hair brushing against Misaki&#39;s ear 
and neck, cascading down Misaki&#39;s front and falling into her lap.

Misaki had already closed her eyes once more, but woon found them wide 
open as the first of Hatoko&#39;s tears began to seep through the fabric.

&quot;Hatoko-chan...&quot; began Misaki, but she couldn&#39;t say anything more. 
Hatoko&#39;s love for her was coursing through her body with full force now, 
and it was so undeniable that Misaki couldn&#39;t utter another word.

&quot;Misaki, you are my pride and joy. The moment I say you, you became my 
life. If we had not spoke of our love for each other, and gone our 
seperate ways... I would have died. I loved you the moment I saw you. I 
am forever here for you. You are more important to me then I am to me. I 
am happier that way.&quot; Hatoko explained softly, passionatly.

The sleepiness that pervades every night fell upon the room. The two 
girls, so lost within their own love, dozed off to sleep even as the 
wind picked up, and as the lightning stormed around like it was trying 
to intimidate the love many might call unnatural. But that is how love 
is. Love will flow when it is allowed to flow. Misaki and Hatoko, free 
of any worldly bonds regarding love, realized that night what love meant 
to each of them. For Misaki, Love is having someone to be there for you. 
Always be there, through any storm, or bout of danger, or discomfort. 
For Hatoko, Love is being there for that person, through all their 
troubles. And of course, as these roles switch from time to time, the 
love itself will go one forever, beyond everything one could ever know. 
Beyond time, beyond life and into the next, beyond the stars and 
straight through black holes, beyond the dark abyss of space and 
everything beyond our universe.

I, the one behind this fanfiction, have grown with this story. One and a 
half years later, look at how the writing style has changed. Looking at 
myself, the change is undeniable as well. But, with all change, there 
are some things that don&#39;t change. This fanfiction is still the heart of 
all Misaki and Hatoko fanfictions in this archive. I am wondering when 
someone will help me out, and write about this wonderful pair. I am 
honored to be a part of the Angelic Layer fanfiction community, and 
receive so many wonderful reviews. With such honor comes duty. And I 
must complete my duty.

Conceptions of Love is the title of my fanfiction, and I believe that 
the conceptions I wished to show, to prove, to live, to be, and to 
cherish have been woven into this story far more then I ever imagined 
that they would be. These conceptions are now proofs. Proofs of the bond 
shared between Misaki and Hatoko. I have written much to live up to the 
title of this fanfiction. You have shared much with me, and hopefully 
grown a bit yourselves. But everything has an end, and this chapter in 
the lives of Misaki and Hatoko is over, for their own conceptions are 
now proofs within them.

Before I close this story, please don&#39;t become too depressed. I still 
have an unfinished story to tell. The story of the bunnies, and the 
story of Misaki and Hatoko&#39;s life, will continue in another fanfiction 
of mine. Soon. I promise. I will continue the glory of Misaki and 
Hatoko. Wish me luck!
