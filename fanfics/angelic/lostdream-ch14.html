New Life

&quot;The sun will set, but it is not over. Let the moon rise.&quot; unknown 
source

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

A group of close friends was gathered around a small table. Hatoko was 
just explaining their recent illness and Misaki was taking her time 
devouring every last morsel of food she could find. It had been quite 
some time since she had last tasted the delectable confections provided 
at the Kobayashi residence. A pink hue overtook her cheeks as she lifted 
half a cookie to her mouth, and squeezed Hatoko next to her with the 
other free arm. Kotarou had trouble looking at her with a straight face, 
and he turned his head to the side.

&quot;And then we died again...&quot; Hatoko continued, speaking as if it was a 
walk in the park on a nice day. A light patter of rain could be heard 
outside. Misaki and Hatoko had seemingly fallen under the spell of its 
watery beauty; it enchanted them whenever they heard or saw it. Of 
course, they could make it rain at any moment of the day, anywhere, on a 
whim, which meant they could sew their lovely evenings any time they 
felt like putting moisture in the sky. Hatoko was busy talking away, and 
Misaki was soon pulled from her dreamy warm state a moment later.

&quot;Aaa...&quot; Tayamo started to say, looking down at her shirt where she had 
just spilled a cup of hot chocolate. &quot;What a pain...&quot; Everyone turned to 
look at Tamayo.

&quot;Tamayo-chan, do you want me to clean you up?&quot; Misaki asked sweetly, in 
an almost motherly way. Tamayo looked at her for a moment awkwardly 
before understand Misaki&#39;s gist. She nodded, and every last trace of the 
spill was gone. A full cup of hot chocolate appeared on the table before 
Tamayo.

&quot;Aaa... Thank you... Misakachi...&quot; Tamayo said, looking a bit nervous. 
Misaki smiled. &quot;You really didn&#39;t have to though, it was my fault, 
really.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay... I want to help.&quot; Five more cups of hot chocolate appeared 
before Tamayo and she nearly jumped up. Misaki went back to fishing for 
sweets and Hatoko continued the story. Kotarou stole away with one of 
the fresh cups and Tamayo gave him an evil eye.

Shortly later, Hatoko finished her story. Misaki, content with what she 
had eaten, started explaining their plans.

&quot;Well, on our way home from school I removed Hatoko&#39;s name from the 
student lists, and did the same for myself. No we don&#39;t have to go 
to...&quot; Misaki started, but Kotarou jumped up.

&quot;You did what? Hatoko should be in school!&quot; Kotarou exclaimed.

&quot;She won&#39;t learn anything in school. She knows it already. Thousands of 
years of knowledge and wisdom will do that to you.&quot; Misaki replied 
softly.

&quot;But... Where will she work when she grows up if she hasn&#39;t even 
graduated elementary school?&quot; Kotarou asked quite intensely, but Hatoko 
and Misaki only giggled at this one.

&quot;Don&#39;t you understand, Kotarou-kun... Our duty is to protect the water 
on the Earth, like the seas and rivers. We don&#39;t need jobs, we have the 
ability to create what we need to live happily. We really don&#39;t have any 
need for money either.&quot; Misaki explained, but Kotarou shook his head at 
this as well.

&quot;You&#39;re still children, especially Hatoko and...&quot; Kotarou ran out of 
words.

&quot;We&#39;re thousands of years old, Kotarou.&quot; Hatoko said simply. &quot;Now sit 
down and stop complaining. Let Misaki finish.&quot; Kotarou felt his knees go 
weak, and he fell back into the furniture.

&quot;Well then... Let&#39;s see... Oh yes, after we talk to your parents about 
all this, and Shouko-san and Mother, we want to live on a magical little 
island. That&#39;s our plan. Of course, we can just zip back over to here 
anytime we want, and when we aren&#39;t busy protecting Atlantis from 
wooden-legged pirates and such. Arg matey.&quot; Misaki willed a patch over 
her eye and grinned.

&quot;You&#39;re... Going to tell Dad and Mom? They are going to kill you... You 
know they don&#39;t approve of your relationship with...&quot; Kotarou began, but 
he stopped himself and looked away, but Hatoko had already heard enough.

&quot;What? I never heard anything like that. Kotarou, they don&#39;t like it?&quot; 
Hatoko stared at her brother, and he glanced back sheepishly.

&quot;It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t like it... It&#39;s that they hate it. They have 
been hoping for some time that you would grow out of it, but they 
haven&#39;t said anything. They want you to marry a respectable guy and have 
kids and have a good job and a good education... Hatoko, they aren&#39;t 
going to understand this. They live by the old traditions.&quot; Hatoko 
looked down, eying Misaki&#39;s arm which was wrapped around her waist. She 
hadn&#39;t expected this. Neither her nor Misaki had any idea that the 
Kobayashi&#39;s were going to be so... close-minded to the whoel affair. 
&quot;Hatoko... You have no choice but to stay here.&quot;

&quot;Actually, I have no choice but to be with Misaki. You probably recall 
that day when you fell out of the bushes. I told you that I would put 
Misaki before you. I will put Misaki before Dad and Mom too. And, if it 
comes to it... I cannot hesitate to defend what me and Misaki have. Do 
you understand what will happen if people try and get in the way of our 
love?&quot; Hatoko replied quietly. Kotarou turned to look at her, but he 
lowered his head after a few moments.

&quot;Yes, I do. Still... They will disown you, Hatoko. You will not be 
allowed to return here.&quot;

&quot;I guess I should have expected that... But, there is nothing I can do 
about it. Our strength comes from being together, and being happy, and 
being free to love. We cannot stay here, especially if Dad and Mom are 
against us. Bad intentions can hurt people.&quot; Hatoko turned to Misaki, 
who was gazing at her teary eyed. &quot;It&#39;s okay Misaki. It&#39;s okay for me to 
do this. For us.&quot;

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

&quot;Mmm... Misaki... We need to talk to your family now...&quot; The two girls 
walked slowly along the wet sidewalk under the cloudy sky. Rain fell, 
but not a drop touched them. They reached Shuuko&#39;s homestead and let 
themselves inside.

&quot;Let&#39;s not worry about it right now... I feel like it would be alright 
to just have some private time. Hatoko-chan, was it okay to leave a note 
like that?&quot; Misaki asked as Hatoko led the way to the bedroom they 
shared, hand in hand.

&quot;I trust Kotarou&#39;s decision on that one. Kotarou is more important to me 
then my parents anyways. He was the one that played with me outside when 
I was younger, not them. He was the one looking after when I got sick.&quot; 
Hatoko explained as they entered the bedroom. Their clothing was 
replaced with bath robes, and Hatoko dragged Misaki to the bathroom.

&quot;Hatoko-chan... I feel bad for you now. I am so lucky to have a good Mom 
and Aunt...&quot; Misaki looked down at the floor. &quot;I suppose it will be 
better now though, I can take care of you. I want to cook for you and 
share fun times with you, and all those other things.&quot;

&quot;I would like that very much, Misaki.&quot; Hatoko turned the water on for 
the bathtub, and she sat on the edge of the basin with Misaki. &quot;But 
first, I must keep my promise to you.&quot; Misaki began to speak, but Hatoko 
silenced her, placing her hand gently over Misaki&#39;s lips. &quot;My Misaki... 
Relax. You have been through a lot, getting new bodies and hair colors 
and all.&quot; She smiled lightly.

Hatoko turned off the water, and she stood up, pulling Misaki with her. 
Hatoko let Misaki&#39;s robe fall to the floor, revealing the glowing 
pendant along with Misaki&#39;s pristine body. She nudged Misaki into the 
the tub gently, and then climbed in after removing her own robe. She 
fell into Misaki&#39;s arms and closed her eyes.

&quot;You missed holding me... You missed being able to feel real warmth, 
Misaki...&quot; Hatoko whispered. Misaki didn&#39;t speak, a tear running down 
her rose red cheeks, falling down onto Hatoko&#39;s shoulder. Hatoko was 
blushing as well, her own eyes tearing.

An hour passed by like it was nothing. Misaki was feeling blissfully at 
ease, all the stress and anxiety that had built up over the last several 
days was finally wearing away. She let the warmth from Hatoko send her 
into a partial sleep, her body slipping beneath the surface of the 
water, dragging Hatoko with her. The smaller girl turned around to face 
the napping goddess, setting her hands and arms on both sides of her, 
laying lightly upon her body. Her dark hair mingled with Misaki&#39;s in the 
water, floating gently. The pendant fell to a rest behind Misaki&#39;s neck 
after Hatoko moved it to the side with her nose. She let her lips drift 
close to Misaki&#39;s, and they met for a brief moment. Energy raced through 
Hatoko, and her cheeks appeared crimson once more.

Hatoko felt little need to hesitate showing any more affection for 
Misaki, who she knew was awake enough to know what was going on. A blush 
creeped upon Misaki&#39;s face as Hatoko let her lips fall firmly against 
Misaki&#39;s and remain there. Hatoko&#39;s eyes began to close, but before she 
could shut them completely, she noticed the pendant grow bright for a 
split second, and then dim back to its normal luminance. A piece of 
knowledge filled her soul and temporarily consumed her mind. The new 
information settled in her thoughts like it had always been there. 
Hatoko released from the affectionate kiss and drew her lips away from 
Misaki&#39;s, breathing in the water.

&quot;Misaki, your cuteness is irresistible.&quot; Hatoko confided softly, and 
Misaki began to squirm slowly underneath her, knowing Hatoko was up to 
something. She too had gained new knowledge.

Misaki&#39;s lips drew open ever so slightly...

.o.

Miu drew close to the lovely girl, her eyes sparkling in the dim light, 
and a soft glow surrounding her figure. The moon was out, although just 
a sliver, it was shining a pearl white light upon the mesa at such a low 
brightness that it tricked the eyes. The girl moved back a step as Miu 
approached. Her foot caught on a rock, and she fell backwards to the 
ground.

Not a sound was heard. Not a tear, nor a grimace. Only a slightly open 
mouth in surprise. Miu followed, slowly letting her body fall upon the 
goddess in front of her. Sapphire ribbons blew in the pleasant sea 
breeze from the girl&#39;s hair, which also caught the wind.

&quot;Let me ease your troubles...&quot; Miu whispered softly. The girl gazed up 
at Miu for what seemed like a great time, but in reality was quite 
short, and she closed her eyes. Energy raced through her body in 
anticipation. Miu lowered her lips to the girl&#39;s, letting her tongue 
slip in just enough to make Mia tremor with her affection.

.o.

Misaki&#39;s eyes shot open, and she attempted to sit up in surprise, but 
Hatoko was still on her. She squirmed instead as Hatoko wandered inside 
her mouth, only to pull away with a dreamy smile upon her open lips, and 
a cherry red hue reaching from one ear to the other. She gazed playfully 
at Misaki.

&quot;Hatoko-chan... Only you would be so bold...&quot; Misaki commented softly, 
letting herself go at ease once more.

&quot;The truly bold are those that strike at the same place more then once,&quot; 
replied Hatoko, smiling down with a mischievous look. Misaki didn&#39;t even 
manage to close her eyes.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Shuuko managed to arrive at home in the middle of the afternoon a couple 
days later, only to find that Misaki and Hatoko were waiting for her 
outside, dressed in another sea blue outfit that looked like the 
crashing waves themselves. Yuuko helped her out of the car, even though 
it wasn&#39;t necessary. Shuuko dropped her things on the pavement and ran 
to the girls, embracing them both at the same time. Shuuko asked them 
how their stay had been, and they both smiled back with big smiles.

&quot;Alone time, hmm... Nothing to embarrassing I hope. I expect full 
details.&quot; Shuuko laughed, and the girls went red, again. &quot;Oh, my.&quot; 
Misaki composed herself and looked up at her mother.

&quot;Umm... Mother... We were wondering if it would be okay to...&quot; Misaki 
started, but her Mother already knew what she was going to say.

&quot;If you want to live alone in some magical place, I don&#39;t have any 
reservations... As long as you promise to take care of each other.&quot; 
Shuuko replied. Hatoko looked up now.

&quot;Did you already hear about my... family?&quot; Hatoko asked. Shuuko nodded 
simply.

&quot;It is your decision, girls, not mine, and not your parents. I know as 
long as your together you&#39;ll be okay. Yano told me to have complete 
faith in you, he knew you were going to be okay in the end anyways.&quot; 
Shuuko pulled a letter from her pocket. &quot;Look.&quot; Misaki and Hatoko read 
the message in silence.

&quot;Shuuko-san,

Your girls are wonderful people. I have no doubt they will succeed in 
all things they do, most especially, their dedication and love for each 
other, and their close friends. It is critical that they are allowed to 
live as they wish to live. They have vast amounts of wisdom and 
knowledge at their fingertips, more then any living human being, 
although from their cute childish voices, it may be difficult to see 
this in the beginning.

However, there are some things that they do not know. They will question 
themselves, in fact. It is natural, and I place the responsibility of 
helping them answer these questions on you. Do not let them down.

The sea gives life to this world. These children are the high spirits 
and protectors of the water on this world. If they become separated for 
too long, they will perish. If they perish, this world will end. 
Eternity is a long time to protect this world, but true love is eternity 
in itself.

After thousands of years in the sea, they are finally ready. They are 
the epitome of eons of prayers and work, for their own sake. Since this 
world began, they were destined to take the this final throne and all 
responsibilities associated with it.

Now, before this information is lost to time, I must apologize to you. I 
am deeply sorry for what happened to Sayoko-san. You know as well as I 
do that she still holds a special place in your heart and your soul. 
Shuuko-san, she is your eternal soul-mate. I am sorry that the fate of 
Misaki-sama and Hatoko-sama rested on your relationship ending with 
Sayoko-san.

You were the original child bearer of both Mia and Miu. In order to 
preserve the integrity of Misaki-sama&#39;s connection to the past, I was 
forced to bend the destiny of your life even though, technically, you 
were already on your life&#39;s true path. Since Misaki-sama and Hatoko-sama 
are bound for all eternity by bonds much stronger then the bonds you 
share with Sayoko-san, I did not need to alter the fate of Hatoko-sama&#39;s 
parents.

I wish you luck in meeting Sayoko-san in your next life. She is not 
naturally evil, however when bending fate, the result will always be 
negative. Fate was not meant to be changed after creation.

Lastly, tell the girls I love them, and that I hope to meet them in a 
future life. Good luck to you all, and farewell.

-Yano&quot;

&quot;Shuuko-san... I...&quot; Hatoko started, but Shuuko stopped her.

&quot;No, Hatoko. Thank you. Thank you for putting her at peace. I will see 
her again in my next life, along with you two, when the time comes.&quot; 
Shuuko interrupted, and she pulled Hatoko close. &quot;You are my daughter 
too. I don&#39;t want you to be sad.&quot; Misaki&#39;s heart lurched.

A thought zipped about the girls&#39; minds, and they nodded at each other 
after a few moments.

&quot;Shuuko-san, we did want to live someplace magical a minute ago, but... 
We remembered something: You are very important to us. We want to be 
close to you in our sleep, and in the mornings while we help with 
breakfast. Just for a bit longer.&quot; Hatoko looked up at Shuuko intently, 
waiting for a reply.

&quot;Please, stay as long as you want. Hatoko, Misaki&#39;s home will always be 
your home too. Only you know when to set out for the world and live by 
yourselves. You are probably recollecting when you once lived on your 
own, even if you don&#39;t know it. Although, I must ask...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Misaki and Hatoko asked at once.

&quot;I must ask what happened between you two while I was away.&quot; Shuuko said 
smiling, leading Misaki and Hatoko into the house by their hands as a 
red hue filled their cheeks.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Author&#39;s Notes:

At last, this story is complete. I hope you enjoyed it. I am considering 
writing another continuation story, but we&#39;ll see how it goes. I am also 
considering creating a set of pictures to go along with this story 
(perhaps one for each chapter). Who knows what I&#39;ll do, or when I&#39;ll 
strike, ne?

Misaki-chan doll say Hi!
