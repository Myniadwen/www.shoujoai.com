Stolen Spirit

&quot;Evil will always have the innate ability to see good, and take it away 
from those it rightfully belongs to. In times like these, you must trust 
your heart, and will your destiny to be good and whole.&quot; unknown source

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

A sudden air of awe could be heard from the children, the glowing vial 
catching their attention as it swung it the air. The light had gone from 
a brilliant white to a crimson red, and it pulsed faster then normal.

&quot;Please, return it to me...&quot; wished Hatako wordlessly to herself, but 
the teacher turned around and strode to her desk.

&quot;Come to me after class.&quot; She said coldly, dropping the vial carelessly 
among the pencils in the middle drawer, and closing it. &quot;Children, get 
back to your writing, please.&quot;

The dazed class, not wanting be the next target, began scribbling out 
words on their papers as the accursed teacher finished roll. Hatako, 
however, was not writing. She stared at her paper, tears beginning to 
form in her eyes.

&quot;I was supposed to protect you Misaki-chan...&quot; she thought sullenly. She 
looked towards the desk, only to realize it was making the faintest 
noise. So busy trying to write a few words, the rest of the class hadn&#39;t 
noticed.

&quot;Fighto...&quot; called Misaki, as audibly as she could. Regardless of what 
anyone happened to be doing at the time, the entire class dropped their 
pencils. The teacher only glared at Hatako.

&quot;Stop making noises or you will be sent home, without the vial, 
Kobayashi,&quot; demanded the teacher sinisterly.

&quot;I didn&#39;t say anything!&quot; Hatako exclaimed, her temperature rising now.

&quot;Teacher... Evil...&quot; called the voice, and 21 pairs of eyes turn to 
glance at the teacher. She stood silently, contempt brewing behind her 
dark eyes, but had no time to say anything: the voice spoke again.

&quot;Class... Dismissed...&quot; Misaki called. The teacher scoffed at this, only 
to be cut short of a laugh. The top drawer in the desk was thumping now. 
Oscillating in tune with the waves. The class bent forward to watch, and 
the teacher took a few steps back. The noise went from a quiet rumble to 
a loud shaking noise in several moments, seconds later splintering into 
a thousand pieces. The teacher was now sitting on the back counter, and 
Hatako knew it was safe to approach the desk. She stood and strode 
forward resolutely.

&quot;Kobaya..&quot; the teacher started to warn.

&quot;Stop me you witch.&quot; Hatako called, knowing full well the teacher 
wouldn&#39;t. The vision Misaki had sent to her only minutes earlier was 
proof enough that she didn&#39;t like &#39;unnatural&#39; things to a point of total 
fear. She stood over the vial now. It glowed brightly upon the floor 
among the splinters. Hatako picked it up, only to find water was 
dripping from its exterior. At first, she thought it might be a crack, 
and peered at it intently, but it wasn&#39;t.

&quot;Tears... Love... Powerful...&quot; Misaki&#39;s voice came, but this time, it 
was only Hatako that heard it.

&quot;I believe this is mine,&quot; Hatako said defiantly as she returned to her 
seat. The children watched her carefully, the teacher watching her even 
more so. Hatako bent the broken clasp around the other side of the 
chain, and seeing that it was strong, slipped it around her neck, the 
vial tucked away in its hiding place.

&quot;Danger... Leave...&quot; Misaki called again, and Hatako saw the teacher 
pacing toward the phone. Misaki concentrated her feelings once again, 
and water began to leak from the base of the device, electronic popping 
noises heard from within.

&quot;Class... Dismissed...&quot; Misaki called loudly, and Hatako stood up, 
grabbed her bag, and strode for the door.

&quot;I&#39;ll have you expelled child,&quot; cried the teacher. Hatako turned, 
confident now. Confident like Misaki had been just a year ago.

&quot;Misaki-chan taught me that I could do anything I wanted, quite 
literally, anything. And now, I will be leaving this school. Who are you 
to think that you can stop me?&quot; Hatako replied, and left through the 
classroom door quickly, running at full speed. The door opened moments 
later, and the teacher appeared, pulling a metal compass from her 
pocket. She began to run at Hatako, who was already down the stairs on 
the first level, running outside into the school grounds.

&quot;Misaki-chan, she is following me!&quot; Hatako cried softly in a bit of a 
huff.

&quot;Faith... Love...&quot; Misaki replied, &quot;Sky...&quot;

Hatako looked up, only to find the once sunny sky had clouded over with 
the darkest clouds she had ever seen. So busy thinking about fleeing 
from the sinister teacher, she didn&#39;t notice she could barely see the 
ground.

Rain began to pour, first slightly, then in torrents. The ground, still 
warm from the sun, vaporized the water, and a mist settled over the 
asphalt. Hatako was halfway to the gate, she turned, only to find the 
enraged teacher twenty feet behind her.

&quot;I shall finish her job myself,&quot; She called, ten feet way now. &quot;You will 
fall as well, hell child.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Misaki called, almost simply. A hailstone the size of a golf 
ball slammed into the teacher&#39;s foot, another hit her shoulder. &quot;I... 
Cannot... Let you...&quot;

The hail did not stop. Another cascaded down from the heavens, slamming 
into the teachers back, knocking her to the ground. She fell, the 
compass dashed upon the ground. The lady reached for it, only to have 
her hand pegged by an icy meteorite moments later. A crunching sound 
could be heard as Hatako slowed and looked back. Blood dripped onto the 
concrete, and the woman cried in agony.

&quot;What is this black magic?&quot; she called, only to be answered by Misaki.

&quot;My Power... Protect... Hatako-chan... In Need...&quot; Misaki replied in a 
strong voice. &quot;Aggression... Of Yours... Death... To You... I Will... 
Promise...&quot;

&quot;How is it... You live, hell child...&quot; called the teacher weakly. &quot;Did 
She fail to kill you?&quot;

&quot;Love... Lost None... Gained More... Soul... Live Forever... Love... 
Forever...&quot; Misaki answered, her voice clear and unwavering.

&quot;You are not a god, you foul demon from below.&quot;

&quot;Love... Infinite Love... Infinite Life...&quot;

&quot;I cannot believe you, for what you have done... The world hates you. 
The universe will fall apart because of you. You have no idea what a 
single action on your part can do to this world. How many people it will 
hurt. How many might have lived had it been different... You have no 
idea. No idea how wrong you are, and now, your friend will die to make 
it right.&quot; The frail woman reach with her left hand into her dress 
jacket, only to pull out a pistol.

A shot, a crash of ice, and another shot. Hatako slumped to the ground, 
clutching her side in shock. The dark woman&#39;s head was now a mess of 
blood and ice, a hailstone had ran straight into her left temple, and 
quite unexpected, a bullet had pierced her chest from the side. Men 
could be heard in the distance, running to the scene.

&quot;Call an ambulance, Yu-san,&quot; the officer called, and another began to 
talk to the dispatcher over the radio. The officer bent down next to the 
child.

&quot;Stay calm, someone will be on the way to take you to the hospital 
shortly. Don&#39;t worry, you haven&#39;t done anything wrong. Your classmates 
went to the classroom next door when they saw this teacher pickup a 
compass and chase you.&quot; The officer moved to inspect Hatako&#39;s wound, 
only to find none. A charred hole in Hatako&#39;s uniform was all that could 
be found.

Hatako didn&#39;t even notice the officer, she didn&#39;t even hear his voice. 
The rain above splashed against her face and drenched her clothes, and 
the wind tossed her hair around whimsically. An ambulance pulled up, and 
paramedics popped out the back ready to carry away Hatako, but she did 
not see it. All she could feel was her heart beating in her chest, and 
her mind going numb. Her thoughts a mess at the sight of the teacher, of 
the rapid events unfolding.  However, one thing was clear in her mind, 
her heart, her soul... She want Misaki to hold her, to comfort her, to 
tenderly embrace her heart with love...

&quot;Officers... Medicine... Give None...&quot; called Misaki, and every single 
one of them stopped in their tracks. Their eyes turned to Hatako. She 
jumped into life at Misaki&#39;s voice, lulled into alertness by its 
distinctive song, and power.

&quot;Miss, what was that sound?&quot; asked a patrolman.

&quot;The voice of someone very dear to me, it is best not to pursue the 
matter further, I&#39;m sorry, I must go home now.&quot; And with that Hatako 
stood and turned around to leave the grounds.

&quot;Miss, I must take a report.&quot; he persisted. &quot;At least... tell me...&quot;

&quot;Love... Conquers... Hate...&quot; Misaki called back to the gathering, even 
while Hatako continued to walk on, the dark clouds only getting darker, 
and the rain beginning to fall forcefully once more.

&quot;Hatako-chan...&quot; Misaki started. &quot;Hatako-chan...&quot; The rain fell so 
thickly, the officers were no longer visible.

Even as Misaki&#39;s words echoed in her ears, Hatako couldn&#39;t find any more 
of her own words to speak, and no thoughts to think. Her breathing was 
erratic, and her heart still beating strangely. She continued to walk.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

The door closed behind Hatako, and she collapsed on the floor. The 
streets outside had begun to flood, and the rain continued to pour. 
Hatako was soaking wet, down to her skin on every inch of her body, but 
it did not bother her. The cold water did not bother her either.

&quot;Why?&quot; Hatako started softly. &quot;Misaki-chan... Why can&#39;t you be here with 
me?&quot;

&quot;Lonely...&quot; Misaki replied. Hatako nodded slowly, tears streaming down 
her face in torrents now.

&quot;The teacher. The blood on the concrete. Flesh upon the ground. Her 
vacant stare... I need you Misaki, more then anything in the world, I 
need you.&quot;

&quot;Loneliness can kill these special bunnies. Be careful, Usako-chan...&quot; 
Misaki recited, straining to keep her words together, pushing feelings 
and emotions through her mind as fast as possible.

&quot;That was from the story I told you awhile ago, Misaki-chan...&quot; Hatako 
replied quietly.

&quot;Story... Was... Not...&quot;

&quot;Misaki-chan, you&#39;re right, it was not a story originally. It was a 
strange dream of mine, I had had it the night before that one, but that 
is all of the dream I remembered.&quot;

&quot;Premonition... Hatako-chan... Possible... Destiny...&quot; Misaki explained, 
and Hatako glanced up a bit to stare out the window, finding herself 
sub-consciously wanting to see Misaki in front of her, for perhaps the 
millionth time.

&quot;Are you saying loneliness... Will kill me?&quot; Hatako asked.

&quot;Only... Thing...&quot; Misaki responded softly.

&quot;It is hurting me right now, Misaki-chan. I am only half whole... Only 
half of you is here now...&quot;

&quot;Kill... Still... Possible...&quot; the voice warned.

&quot;Another test, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Hatako questioned, sincerely now.

&quot;Of Heart... Hide Fear... Head High... Love... Forever...&quot;

&quot;That I must do... But it does not change the fact I miss you. Does not 
change the fact I am lonely, and incapable of escaping it without 
perishing from it. People in this world wish for immortality when they 
have happy lives, and I, I want to die simply, quickly. I want to be 
with you now... Is this right? Immortal when sad? Trapped without you on 
this world, waiting a painfully long time... just to die?&quot; Hatako cried, 
contempt for the situation they were forced into edging deeply into her 
voice.

&quot;Our Price... For Eachother... Our Tests... Of Dedication... To Be With 
You... One Minute... I Would Happily Wait... Ten Thousand Years...&quot;

A chord was struck in Hatako, and she pulled the vial from under her 
shirt, holding it in her hands before her eyes. She stared at it for 
several moments.

&quot;Misaki...&quot; Hatako cried softly.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

&quot;There have been many reports of flooding in the Downtown Tokyo 
district, authorities have issued flash flood warnings to the entire 
region. Rainfall was closing in at nearly 30 centimeters an hour just 
thirty minutes ago. Reports of large hailstones have also been received, 
only to be confirmed by a police officer.

&quot;In related news, tsunami like waves have been sighted at all major 
beaches in the Pacific Rim. Officials have closed all public beaches, 
and vessels under 40 meters long are being asked to dock immediately. 
Eyewitnesses claim to have seen the waves nearly &#39;appear out of thin 
air&#39;. Scientists are baffled as to how they are appearing, their have 
been no recent earthquakes or platonic plate movements recently.

&quot;The National government has called a state of emergency, while only one 
death has been confirmed, and the irregular weather pattern seems to 
have mostly resided along with the waves, emergency crews are being 
assembled for standby. It is advi...&quot;

Hatako turned off the television.

&quot;Hatako-chan... You...&quot; Misaki started.

&quot;I must have the same influence over water as you do... My emotions made 
this mess...&quot; Hatako confided quietly.

&quot;Mine... As Well... Careful... Must Be...&quot;

&quot;Yes... We know well now... We are more then human...&quot;

A vision appeared for Hatako, it was back a year ago, it was her story 
about the bunnies...

&quot;Remember this: Once you find that other bunny, you will be forever 
happy, forever young and spirited, forever together. And then, as the 
bunnies you called your friends die, you will realize that you and your 
soul bunny are more special then any other bunny alive. Remember this, 
and don&#39;t be scared when it happens. Take care, Usako-chan.&quot; Hatako 
heard herself saying, many months ago. There was no doubt about it now. 
They were indeed special. Lonely, and sad... But special. Another tear 
escaped Hatako&#39;s eye.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Author&#39;s Notes:

There appears to be some massive failure with the review system every 
once in awhile. I have a feeling it happens when a database server goes 
down, because the fanfictions are still available, but appending the 
database is not. I have a feeling reviewing functions are locked because 
of database issues because I have chanced upon similar problems at 
random times of the day when I am trying to edit my profile.

In the case you have a problem submitting a review, you can either wait 
for the database server to come back up, or you may send it to my email 
box. My email is available on my profile page. If you send it by email, 
I ask that you include that you want me to post it for you, and for what 
chapter.  I refuse to post any review that does not include a request, 
per chance that the reviewer did not want the review posted.

Thanks for your continued interest, and enjoy the show. Move along now 
please.
