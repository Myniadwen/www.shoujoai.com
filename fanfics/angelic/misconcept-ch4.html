&quot;I&#39;m home Misaki-chan!&quot; shouted Shoko as she dropped her things and ran 
to Misaki&#39;s room, only to find her friends already inside.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m glad that your friends stopped by Misaki-chan! How are you 
feeling? Is you fever gone? What about the rest of you, warm I hope...&quot; 
said Shoko as she filled out a mental checklist while checking Misaki 
herself.

&quot;I&#39;m better I guess, but I&#39;m still kinda weak... Next time I&#39;ll remember 
to cover myself up before I go to bed.&quot; replied Misaki. Her Aunt smiled 
and then looked at Misaki&#39;s friends.

&quot;Call your parents, tell them your staying for dinner.&quot; instructed 
Shoko. Big grins appeared on all three of their faces. Kotarou and 
Tamayo rushed to make the necassary calls, as Hatoko stayed with Misaki. 
Her brother would make the call for both of them.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll start making a quick dinner for everyone since your not up 
for cooking Misaki-chan,&quot; said Shoko as she left the room. Hatoko went 
to sit next to Misaki on her bed. They were both happy that they could 
be around each other for at least another hour.

&quot;This will be fun... I might have an excuse to feed you myself if you 
can&#39;t even hug me Misaki-chan,&quot; joked Hatoko, referring to Misaki&#39;s 
weakness.

&quot;I&#39;m sure that&#39;d freak Kotarou-kun and Tamayo-chan out... Shoko-san 
whould think it was cute though.&quot; grinned Misaki.

&quot;Well, let&#39;s get you out of bed so you can eat at the table.&quot; decided 
Hatoko. Misaki nodded and slowly rolled her legs to the side of the bed 
and began to stand up, however her legs were a little shakey. Hatoko 
grabbed her hand to help but Misaki shook herself to the falling point. 
She lost her balance sending her and Hatoko into the bed. Hatoko was 
thrown onto Misaki and they found themselves in a familiar position. 
(^_^)

&quot;I don&#39;t think I ever want to move now... but the door is open.&quot; pointed 
out Misaki. Hatoko kissed Misaki on the cheek.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, they won&#39;t see a thing,&quot; replied Hatoko, &quot;those love-birds 
are to wrapped up in themselves. Besides, bunnies are stealthy.&quot;

Hatoko helped Misaki up, and this time she supported Misaki by holding 
onto her waist as Misaki rested her arm across Hatoko&#39;s shoulder-blade. 
They slowly made their way to the dinner table, and each step Misaki 
took her body regained strength. By the time they were at the dinner 
table Misaki could walk on her own. Tamayo met them making their way to 
the table.

&quot;I&#39;ve just called and I can stay for dinner!&quot; declared Tamayo. She 
bounced around while Kotarou called his parents in the background. Shoko 
was busy preparing a quick dinner for everyone, using a recipe that 
Misaki had given her, as she was afraid to feed guests food that she had 
just randomly prepared. Kotarou hung up and walked over to Misaki, 
Hatoko, and Tamayo.

&quot;Well Hatoko-chan, they&#39;re fine with it.&quot; informed Kotarou, referring to 
his and Hatoko&#39;s parents. Hatoko put on a smile and lead Misaki over to 
the table to sit down. Hatoko sat in the seat next to Misaki as Kotarou 
and Tamayo took the seats on the opposite side of table. Shoko noticed 
the arrangment and just smiled.

&quot;Bunnies and Love-birds...&quot; she mumbled. Everyone heard it of course. 
They all dropped their heads and grew red in the face. They all knew 
what she was talking about. Shoko just laughed a bit as she finished 
preparing dinner.

When Kotarou and Tamayo finally lifted their heads, they noticed Misaki 
and Hatoko still red in the face. They didn&#39;t say anything however as 
Shoko jumped in with a tray covered with many different foods.

&quot;Please take what you like and eat everything that you take and enjoy, 
although I bet your hooked on Misaki-chan&#39;s cooking,&quot; said Shoko. She 
just smiled as everyone dug in. They were all starving. Misaki followed 
the rest, if not slower then them. Hatoko noticed and she placed food on 
Misaki&#39;s place instead of her own.

&quot;Thanks, Hatoko-chan. My arms don&#39;t want to move tonight...&quot; she 
confessed as Hatoko placed more food on her plate before grabbing more 
for herself. Shoko noticed that Hatoko had placed the best looking piece 
of food from each of the foods on the tray on Misaki&#39;s plate. She smiled 
as she swallowed down another piece of sashimi (raw fresh fish, usually 
eaten with wasabi and/or soy sauce).

Misaki just continued eating at a steady pace while the rest of them 
talked in between bites. Hatoko placed more food on Misaki&#39;s plate if it 
became empty. Kotarou and Tamayo chatted with Shoko about their karate 
and such, glad to get some attention since Misaki was an attention 
magnet whenever they were outside of the house, thanks to her 
championship title.

Out of courtesy, Kotarou and Tamayo did the dishes for Shoko. Hatoko 
lead Misaki over to the couch. Shoko just watched as the children did 
the dishes without being told to. She glanced towards Misaki and Hatoko 
who were quietly whispering to each other. She wished they&#39;d stay over 
more often.

---

The rain seemed to finally stop that night. Kotarou, Tamayo, and Hatoko 
were picked up by their parents. Misaki just watched as Hatoko left and 
sighed. She&#39;d miss her. Misaki slowly made her way to bed. Shoko noticed 
this and called after her.

&quot;You&#39;ll see her tomorrow, don&#39;t worry,&quot; said Shoko. Misaki continued to 
walk towards her room, but she was looking straight ahead and her eyes 
grew big. Her mouth opened up in shock. A quiet &#39;ah&#39; could be heard. 
Shoko grinned a big grin, but left Misaki alone as she hurried off to 
her room.

Upon reaching her room she laid down on her bed with a fall from the 
base. She struggled with the covers for a few minutes before pulling 
them up onto herself.

&quot;I need to talk to Hatoko-chan tomorrow,&quot; she mumbled to herself before 
falling asleep.

---

The next morning the sun actually shown into Misaki&#39;s room for a change. 
She began to move, but then noticed she had a thobbing headache. She 
felt her own head to find it broiling as well.

&quot;Shoko won&#39;t let me go to school if I&#39;m like this, although I can at 
least move today.&quot; said Misaki. Shoko threw open the door and popped in, 
scaring Misaki.

&quot;Let&#39;s see... fever, headache, your staying home today. It&#39;s the only 
way you&#39;ll get better. Must have picked up a cold or something that 
previous night...&quot; thought Shoko out loud. Misaki just looked out the 
window.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell your friends that your sick though, maybe they can keep you 
company until I get home... although tonight is going to be bad, I&#39;m 
going to have to work overtime because of a special report... oh I hate 
it when they do this to me...&quot; rambled on Shoko. Misaki smiled at the 
thought of having her friends come over again. More precisely: of having 
Hatoko over again.

&quot;Well, I better go, take care, and eat a good breakfast.&quot; shouted back 
Shoko as she raced to her car. She would be late again. Although that 
was normal for her, and her boss didn&#39;t mind at all really. Shoko was 
the most popular reporter in all of Japan thanks to Misaki&#39;s win at the 
championships, so being a few minutes late to take care of the champion 
wasn&#39;t a big deal.

Misaki sat against the head board on her bed and tried to wake up enough 
to get out of bed and prepare herself breakfast. A few minutes later she 
got up and walked over to the kitchen. She opened the fridge to find 
sushi leftover from last nights meal. Just enough for breakfast. She 
reached in and took out the tray, and then sat down at the table to 
munch on her breakfast.

Misaki&#39;s headache didn&#39;t relent. It just throbbed. Her fever compounded 
the effects and made her tired and dizzy. She continued to eat her 
sushi, and when she had eaten all she could eat she placed the remains 
back in the fridge for lunch. She plodded her way to the bathroom to 
cleanup. She hadn&#39;t showered in ages as far as she was concerned.

The warm water flowed over Misaki as she slowly rinsed the soap out of 
her hair. She kept the water temperature low on purpose to cool her 
down. Her eyes grew heavy suddenly. Misaki rushed through the shower as 
fast as she good. The fever and headache were putting her asleep. She 
stepped out of the shower and dried off, put on her clothes, and then 
made her way to her bedroom where she collapsed on the bed.

---

Kotarou and Tamayo walked to Hatoko&#39;s classroom to get her. Kotarou 
spoke up.

&quot;Have you noticed the way Suzuhara-san and Hatoko-chan have been acting 
lately?&quot; asked Kotarou. Tamayo nodded.

&quot;They&#39;ve been a little funny lately, and their always blushing around 
each other, but I wouldn&#39;t do anything...&quot; replied Tamayo.

&quot;If that funny is funny business Hatoko-chan is going to get it,&quot; 
decided Kotarou. Tamayo didn&#39;t answer him. They reached Hatoko&#39;s 
classroom and picked up Hatoko, then set off for Misaki&#39;s Aunt&#39;s house.

---

Misaki awoke to hear the door opening, and the next thing she knew 
Hatoko was running towards her.

&quot;Misaki-chan! There you are!&quot; shouted Hatoko happily. She gave Misaki a 
quick hug before Kotarou and Tamayo showed up.

&quot;Hello Hatoko-chan, I&#39;m glad you came over today,&quot; replied Misaki. 
Hatoko grinned as Kotarou and Tamayo showed up, as for-told by the great 
mystic Hatoko, outside of Misaki&#39;s door. They stood there wondering if 
it would be safe to enter the room while Hatoko was near Misaki, as if 
something might happen.

&quot;Come in now... don&#39;t be standing around,&quot; invited Misaki. They stepped 
into Misaki&#39;s room and slowly came over to Misaki&#39;s bedside. Kotarou 
pulled out a pile of papers and dropped them on Misaki&#39;s desk. The sound 
they made was the worst sound for anybody at Misaki&#39;s age.

&quot;Schoolwork and homework, gift for you from your teachers.&quot; said 
Kotarou. Misaki didn&#39;t like the pile of work at all, and put on a sad 
face.

&quot;Ohh... stupid work... that&#39;ll take weeks!&quot; thought Misaki out loud.

&quot;I&#39;m sure that Kotarou and Tamayo will help you Misaki-chan,&quot; said 
Hatoko. Misaki nodded. Hatoko looked at Kotarou and Tamayo.

&quot;No... they WILL help you. Right Niichan, Tamayo-chan?&quot; said Hatoko as 
she glared at the love-birds.

&quot;Y.. Yea, we will, I guess...&quot; replied Kotarou hesitantly.

&quot;Volunteering me are we?&quot; said Tamayo as she jumped onto Kotarou&#39;s back 
and starting choking him. Hatoko laughed, but noticed that Misaki hadn&#39;t 
even cracked a smile. Hatoko looked closer and found that she had fallen 
asleep yet again.

&quot;Shhh! Misaki-chan is asleep.&quot; whispered Hatoko with a finger to her 
lips. Tamayo let go of Kotarou and they left the room. Misaki followed 
them, but only to close the bedroom door and lock it.

Kotarou and Tamayo noticed they had been locked out again, but used it 
to their advantage. They kissed each other lightly and went into 
lovey-dovey mode. Hatoko heard the kiss through the thin door and nearly 
laughed, and whould have, if Misaki wasn&#39;t asleep.

Hatoko walked back to Misaki&#39;s bed and laid down next to her. She closed 
her eyes as she wrapped her arms around Misaki from the back. It 
couldn&#39;t get any better for Hatoko. Misaki always gave her a warm fuzzy 
feeling weither they were hugging or sharing peeks on the cheeks, the 
feeling was still the same. It wasn&#39;t something to wonder about either, 
Hatoko knew she loved Misaki to death.

&quot;I&#39;ll always take care of you Misaki, you are that kind of person that 
needs someone to take care of you...&quot; whispered Hatoko.
