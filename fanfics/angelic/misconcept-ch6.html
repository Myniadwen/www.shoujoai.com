Misaki and Hatoko slept together that night, embracing each other 
asleep. It rained that night as another large cloud covered the city. 
Hatoko awoke to find herself in Misaki&#39;s arms, close and near to her. 
Misaki&#39;s warmth was comforting, even as the cold wind and water filled 
the air outside. Misaki woke up a few minutes later. She was still down 
about her aunt, but she smiled at Hatoko in spite of the fact.

&quot;Good morning Misaki-chan,&quot; whispered Hatoko.

&quot;Good morning Hatoko-chan,&quot; whispered back Misaki. They tightened the 
embrace for a few seconds. Footsteps could be heard outside of the door, 
along with the pouring rain. They stopped at the door to Misaki&#39;s guest 
room.

They unknown person knocked on the door. Misaki asked who it was.

&quot;It&#39;s me Suzuhara-san, is Hatoko-chan around? She isn&#39;t in her room and 
the bed is still made...&quot; asked Kotarou through the door. Hatoko looked 
into Misaki&#39;s eyes.

&quot;We can&#39;t hide forever Misaki-chan...&quot; whispered Hatoko. Misaki nodded 
slowly.

&quot;I&#39;m here Kotarou-kun,&quot; answered Hatoko. An expression of disbelief 
could be heard from the other side of the door. Kotarou slid it open, 
ready to see what he expected to see. He got more then he bargained for, 
Misaki and Hatoko were hugging each other. He quickly grew angry at his 
younger sister.

&quot;Get over here Hatoko!&quot; he ordered angrily.

&quot;No.&quot; replied Hatoko.

&quot;What?!&quot; shouted back Kotarou. His face became a mess of angry 
expressions.

&quot;I love Misaki. Go away,&quot; Hatoko said back.

Kotarou didn&#39;t want to take it anymore. Each moment that passed Hatoko 
hugged tighter and tighter onto Misaki. Kotarou strode up to the bed and 
ripped Hatoko away from Misaki. He dragged Hatoko out of the room 
quickly. Hatoko and Misaki reached out for each other as they became 
farther and farther apart. Finally, Hatoko was out of sight. Misaki 
could hear the door to the room next door close.

Misaki didn&#39;t know what to do. She collapsed onto her bed. She looked up 
at the ceiling. The rain poured down outside. Kotarou&#39;s voice could be 
heard through the thin walls. He spoke angrily to Hatoko.

Her Aunt, and now this. Misaki felt as if the world was at her neck. 
Since the start of loving Hatoko it was if someone was trying to stop 
them, or to cause them grief. Misaki broke into tears, which poured down 
her contorted face as the rain poured down outside onto the already 
saturated ground. The cold wind blew in through Misaki&#39;s still open 
door. In Kotarou&#39;s rage he had forgotten to close it.

Misaki looked outside at the rain as her tears rolled down her cheeks. 
She gasped for breath as the fit of sadness continued.

Next door Hatoko took each of Kotarou&#39;s verbal blows. She tried to 
ignore them. She prayed for Misaki to remember what she had. She knew 
that Misaki was strong enough to face Kotarou in a fight of words. 
Hatoko closed her eyes as small tears emerged from them as Kotarou made 
incriminating remarks at her and Misaki.

The angry remarks passed through the walls to Misaki&#39;s ears. Kotarou was 
insulting them and their love now. Fear for Hatoko entered Misaki&#39;s 
heart. She couldn&#39;t let this continue, but what should she do?

Misaki closed her tearing eyes. She loved Hatoko. She couldn&#39;t let this 
happen. She would do something, even if she had no idea what. She stood 
up and stode over to Misaki&#39;s door. The cold wind didn&#39;t bother her 
anymore. The sound of the rain was drowned out. She slid open Hatoko&#39;s 
door.

Misaki strode to Kotarou. He turned around and Misaki slapped his 
facewith fury. It knocked Kotarou off balance and he had to take a step 
to save himself.

&quot;How dare you Kotarou. How dare you interfere.&quot; scolded Misaki. She 
forgot her manners. She stared into Kotarou&#39;s eyes with a fiery anger. 
Kotarou was shaken, but attacked Misaki.

&quot;What your doing is wrong Misaki. Period.&quot; fought back Kotarou. He 
glared into Misaki&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Love is not wrong Kotarou.&quot; replied Misaki.

&quot;You love a girl, Misaki! You even slept with her! That&#39;s wrong!&quot; 
Kotarou exclaimed.

&quot;Love is a pure emotion. There are no restrictions to it! When will you 
unlearn what the world has taught you? You haven&#39;t learned anything, 
have you? When you can learn to tolerate people beliefs, then tell me! 
Until then your only a discriminatory evil who can&#39;t accept people for 
who they are, for what they believe, for what they stand for, and for 
who they love. I love Hatoko-chan with all my heart.&quot; Misaki pounded 
with words of fire and lightning. Kotarou&#39;s face became a mess of 
emotions. He ran out of the room, ashamed and embarressed, and angry at 
everything.

Hatoko looked at Misaki, her eyes watering. Misaki had defended Hatoko 
like no one else ever had. She ran to Misaki, leaving a trail of tears. 
She jumped onto Misaki and wrapped her arms around her neck, and her 
legs around her waist. She dug her head into Misaki&#39;s chest and silently 
cried out the emotions that Kotarou had instilled within her. Misaki 
wrapped her arms around Hatoko to support her.

&quot;It will be ok Hatoko-chan...&quot; whispered Misaki into Hatoko&#39;s ear. She 
kissed her on the her tear-stained cheek. Hatoko looked up into the eyes 
of her beholder. Misaki looked into Hatoko&#39;s. Deep within those eyes was 
the compassion that had remained burning, even through the coldness of 
Kotarou&#39;s hostility.

A few minutes passed before Hatoko decided to speak. Kotarou had hurt 
her spirit with word of hate and expressions reserved for adults. She 
spoke quietly as if someone was around, but no one was.

&quot;Your wonderful Misaki-chan... You came to my rescue.&quot; whispered Hatoko.

&quot;No, I came to our rescue Hatoko-chan. He attacked both of us, and what 
we believe. We&#39;re in this together, remember?&quot; replied Misaki. Hatoko 
smiled. Misaki was good in handling these situations because she was 
confident in her decisions once she had made and committed to them.

&quot;In any case, Kotarou-kun knows now. I&#39;m glad that we got it over with. 
He&#39;s stubborn when it comes to accepting new things...&quot; said Hatoko 
quietly. Misaki nodded.

&quot;I just hope he didn&#39;t take it to harshly, I don&#39;t want to be enemies.&quot; 
added Misaki. Hatoko smiled, Misaki hated making enemies.

---

Kotarou was in his room, lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling. He 
knew it deep within himself that Misaki was right. He couldn&#39;t stop love 
even if he was God himself. But how could he face Misaki now? It didn&#39;t 
matter how, he knew he had to. He wanted to remain friends with her.

Kotarou stood up and walked back towards Hatoko&#39;s room. He reached it, 
only to find Hatoko still clinging to Misaki. He stopped himself from 
letting out another gasp, from taking a step back, and stepped forward. 
Misaki turned to look at him.

&quot;I.. I&#39;m sorry Misaki-san and Hatoko-chan...&quot; apologized Kotarou. He 
bowed slightly, his head down.

&quot;It&#39;s ok Kotarou-kun, many people have a hard time adjusting to new 
things,&quot; replied Misaki. She took a hand off of Hatoko and extended it 
towards Kotarou, &quot;But we&#39;re still firends, right?&quot;

Kotarou extended his hand, and they shook on it. Misaki withdrew her 
hand prematurly to save Hatoko from following.

Kotarou couldn&#39;t help but smile. Misaki didn&#39;t have to forgive him. 
Kotarou wouldn&#39;t have forgiven himself for what he said to Hatoko in his 
rage. He was glad to have such a good friend such as Misaki once again. 
He was also glad for Hatoko. Misaki would take care of her no matter 
what.

Kotarou walked away as Misaki carried Hatoko back to her guest room. She 
gently set her on the soft bed and released Hatoko from her grip. Misaki 
moved to turn around, but found that Hatoko was still clinging to her.

&quot;Hatoko-chan, is there something you need?&quot; asked Misaki. Hatoko smiled 
back.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you comfortable in your pajamas Misaki-chan? Why change?&quot; 
replied Hatoko. Misaki smiled. Hatoko knew exactly what she had planned 
to do. Oh well, Hatoko didn&#39;t want her to change out of her pajamas. 
Misaki scooted Hatoko over and laid down next to her.

&quot;It&#39;s still raining,&quot; pointed out Misaki, &quot;are you cold Hatoko-chan?&quot;

&quot;A little.&quot; said Hatoko in reply. Misaki pulled the covers over them. 
Hatoko grew brave and climbed atop Misaki, who blushed slightly. They 
laid stomach to stomach as Hatoko grew sleepy from the warm feelings 
that Misaki gave to her. They listened to the rain outside as it hit the 
ground. It was soothing to Misaki. She had always liked to listen to the 
rain.

&quot;Bad bunny... I&#39;m going to catch you and make you mine...&quot; whispered 
Hatoko. Misaki looked at Hatoko, but only found that she was in a light 
sleep, dreaming. Misaki decided to play with Hatoko&#39;s dreams.

&quot;You&#39;ll never catch me...&quot; whispered Misaki into Hatoko&#39;s ear.

&quot;Oh yes I am. I&#39;m going to catch you with my fish net, then I&#39;m going to 
clean you all up and then I&#39;m going to feed you sushi. You&#39;ll like it so 
much that you&#39;ll let me cook you up for dinner, you cute little bunny 
you...&quot; mumbled Hatoko. Misaki giggled. Perhaps to loud as Hatoko woke 
up.

&quot;You were dreaming Hatoko-chan,&quot; informed Misaki. Hatoko looked 
bewildered.

&quot;I was? Did I say anything wierd or funny or something? You seem to be 
giggling...&quot; asked Hatoko.

&quot;No, nothing at all... You didn&#39;t say nothing, nothing at all. Nope, it 
wasn&#39;t me,&quot; rambled on Misaki. Hatoko knew Misaki was playing with her.

&quot;Why, you&#39;re being a bad bunny today aren&#39;t you my Misaki-chan? It 
deserves punishment you know...&quot; threated Hatoko with a smile. Misaki 
put on an innocent look.

&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything,&quot; replied Misaki.

&quot;The verdict is in, and you are one guilty bunny. Judge, Jury, and 
Executioner, I, Hatoko, sentence you to the following punishments: You 
must give me a bath, must pamper me, and you must be my slave for one 
day.&quot; decided Hatoko. She knew that Misaki wouldn&#39;t mind such a 
&#39;punishment&#39;, but Msiaki played along.

&quot;Oh that is to harsh Judge, Jury, and Executioner Hatoko-chan...&quot; toyed 
Misaki. Hatoko grinned.

&quot;You&#39;re absolutely right Misaki-chan, you need a real execution as 
well,&quot; agreed Hatoko. She leaned forward and kissed Misaki on the lips. 
It was a first for both of them, but they enjoyed the sensation and 
warmth that flowed into them.

&quot;Not bad for an execution... Will you please execute me again 
Hatoko-chan?&quot; grinned Misaki.

&quot;Gladly,&quot; replied Hatoko.

* Good, I hope? I hope I hope I hope it was good! I hope everyone enjoys 
my odd sense of humor. I hope that no one is mad at me for some odd 
reason. I hope that I get to have sushi soon, I haven&#39;t had any for a 
long time... my mouth waters for sushi... SUUUUSHIIIII...
