Kotarou and Tamayo were sitting on the couch growing uneasy as time 
ticked away. Hatoko noticed the time as well. Even if Shoko was going to 
be putting in over time today, she would at least be home by now. It was 
already 9:30 PM. The phone rang.

&quot;Suzuhara residence,&quot; answered Kotarou. He heard a familiar voice, 
however it sounded pained.

&quot;Mother?&quot; said Kotarou, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Shoko-san was in a car accident half an hour ago. I received a call 
from Misaki-chan&#39;s Mother.&quot; replied Kotarou&#39;s mother slowly. Kotarou 
took a breath.

&quot;Is she...&quot; started Kotarou.

&quot;She&#39;s alive, luckily. She didn&#39;t sustain any permanent injuries, 
however she won&#39;t be coming home tonight...&quot; said Kotarou&#39;s Mother.

&quot;What are you implying then?&quot; asked Kotarou.

&quot;Misaki-chan will be spending the night with us again. We can&#39;t leave 
her alone. Please break the news to her gently and ask Tamayo or Hatoko 
to help prepare a few sets of clothes. I&#39;m on my way.&quot; and with that she 
hung up. Kotarou slowly placed the phone on the receiver. He sat next to 
Tamayo and relayed the information, and then they both went to knock on 
Misaki&#39;s door.

Hatoko heard knocks on the door. She left Misaki&#39;s side and walked 
slowly to the door. Misaki turned around to watch.

&quot;Yes?&quot; asked Hatoko.

&quot;Something has happened, we need to speak to Suzuhara-san,&quot; replied 
Kotarou. Hatoko noticed that something BAD had happened, as indicated my 
Kotarou&#39;s voice which she knew so well. She unlocked the door and 
Kotarou and Tamayo followed Hatoko to Misaki&#39;s bedside. Hatoko sat down 
next to Misaki.

Kotarou broke the news to Misaki as gently as he good. He and Tamayo 
left the room quietly. They tried to make Hatoko come as well, but 
Misaki wrapped her arms around her. The body language was enough to keep 
Kotarou and Tamayo from taking Hatoko away. The bedroom door closed.

Misaki was in a state of slight shock. Her eyes went blank. Her body 
became heavy against Hatoko. Misaki didn;t know what to think, all she 
could do was cry again. Tears rolled down her face onto Hatoko&#39;s 
shoulder. Hatoko attempted to face Misaki, but Misaki interpetted as it 
like Hatoko was trying to get away. Misaki held tigher onto Hatoko&#39;s 
abdomen.

&quot;Misaki-chan...&quot; whispered Hatoko. No reply.

&quot;She&#39;ll be ok Misaki-chan...&quot; Hatoko whispered. Again, no reply. Hatoko 
tried a different approach.

&quot;I&#39;ll stay with you Misaki-chan. Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll stay with you 
tonight, and past that, whatever it takes...&quot; she whispered again. 
Misaki looked into Hatoko&#39;s eyes. Hatoko looked back into Misaki&#39;s. 
Misaki managed a small smile. She wiped away her tears, however she had 
nothing to say, her mouth didn&#39;t want to make words.

&quot;Can you let me go so I can pack a few things for you Misaki-chan?&quot; 
asked Hatoko. Misaki nodded. Her arms fell to her sides. She watched 
Hatoko as she packed clothes for her. Misaki recovered her voice.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you Hatoko-chan... No one has ever do 
this much for me in such a short time... It kinda makes me feel 
guilty...&quot; mumbled Misaki with her head down. Hatoko looked at her for a 
moment.

&quot;Don&#39;t ever feel guilty Misaki-chan... I do this because I love you, and 
you deserve it more then anyone else I know.&quot; replied Hatoko, who had 
just finished packing Misaki&#39;s suitcase.

&quot;Now stop worrying. Your coming with me to spend the night again, 
remember? Everything will be fine... see? Your suitcase is packed. 
Shoko-san will be fine. She&#39;ll probably call you tomorrow anyways.&quot; 
reassured Hatoko. She put out her hand for Misaki and pulled her up.

&quot;Hold my hand Misaki-chan,&quot; said Hatoko as she grabbed Misaki&#39;s hand. 
Hatoko used her other hand to pull the suitcase behind as she lead 
Misaki out to the front of the house to wait for her mother. Kotarou and 
Tamayo went through the house and turned off the lights. They came 
outside and locked the door behind them. Kotarou and Hatoko&#39;s mother 
appeared soon after in front of the house.

---
Tamayo was dropped off at her own home as her parents were there.

After arriving at Kotarou&#39;s (and Hatoko&#39;s) home/dojo, they were served a 
late dinner snack as no one had eaten yet. Kotarou went off to bed. 
Hatoko and Misaki started off for the guest room that Misaki had stayed 
in last time, but Hatoko&#39;s Mother stopped Hatoko. Misaki didn&#39;t notice 
and continued on.

&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;s feeling pretty down. Please take care of her tonight 
Hatoko. I know she trusts you.&quot; asked Hatoko&#39;s Mother of Hatoko. Hatoko 
nodded as she looked into her Mother&#39;s understanding eyes.

Hatoko caught up with Misaki. They entered the guest room that Misaki 
had used last time and Hatoko set the suitcase to the side of the desk. 
Misaki walked slowly to the bed and collapsed into it. Hatoko wandered 
over and sat down next to Misaki.

&quot;I wish this didn&#39;t have to happen to Shoko-san...&quot; said Misaki quietly.

&quot;You couldn&#39;t do anything to stop it Misaki-chan, things happen and all 
you can do is get through them somehow.&quot; replied Hatoko.

&quot;It&#39;s not fair though Hatoko-chan, she never hurt anybody.&quot; whispered 
back Misaki as a tear fell from her face onto the sheets of the bed.

&quot;I know Misaki-chan...&quot; comforted Hatoko. Misaki reached out for Hatoko 
and pulled her close. Misaki broke into tears as she embraced Hatoko 
once again. She buried her face into Hatoko&#39;s chest.

Hatoko was helpless now. She knew that Misaki just had to get over the 
fact that Shoko was injured because bad things happen to the innocent 
just because they do. She let Misaki use her as a rag-doll as the night 
continued on.

Thunder could be heard in the distance. It would rain soon. The room 
would become cold. Hatoko managed to pull the covers over herself and 
Misaki. Misaki didn&#39;t seem to notice however. All she could do at the 
moment was moisten Hatoko&#39;s clothing with tears. This occured to Hatoko.

&quot;Misaki-chan, we need to put on our pajama-gowns...&quot; said Hatoko as she 
rubbed Misaki&#39;s back. Misaki looked up and nodded slowly.

&quot;Ok Misaki-chan... I&#39;ll be back shortly.&quot; and with that Hatoko left to 
get her pajamas. As soon as she left the room she ran to her own and 
came back with the pajamas, incase Misaki grew uneasy.

Hatoko shed her clothing and wriggled into her pajamas. She found 
Misaki&#39;s pajamas in her suitcase and went over to Misaki. Misaki stood 
up slowly and looked blankly at Hatoko.

&quot;Arms up...&quot; ordered Hatoko softly. Misaki put her arms up and Hatoko 
whipped off her shirt and slipped off her pants. She tossed Misaki&#39;s 
pajama-gown over her head and pulled it down to the floor. (note *1)

&quot;Just like a child...&quot; joked Hatoko. Misaki gave a weak smile, still 
uneasy about the events that had taken place. Misaki lay back down on 
the bed and beckoned for Hatoko.

Hatoko laid down and Misaki pulled her into another embrace after Hatoko 
had pulled up the covers.

Neither of them could help but smile. Neither of them cared when or how 
the others finally figured out their relationship. All they cared about 
was each other now. They were inseperable. Glued together by the 
emotional glue called love forever.

*Yay! That was have been the shortest time I wrote a chapter of this 
size! So I can now say: Chapter 5 all done!

* Expect revisions tomorrow as I still need to check it for errors. I 
find it easier to check for errors if you wait a bit ^_^.

* Have no clue what I&#39;ll do for chapter 6 yet... Maybe those that are 
reading might wanna suggest a few ideas in the reviews section ^_^

* Anyways, thanks for reading! Please visit my site at

*Notes:

*1: For those people out there that think that love is purely for sexual 
purposes/desires/intentions, Misaki and Hatoko&#39;s relationship is not 
sexual at all. They gain no sexual stimulation from each other, as true 
love should be. Neither of them are even 13... sheesh...</pre>
