From the sky the rain came as it quietly showered down. Kotarou had 
called up Tamayo to come over, and Misaki was with Hatoko, getting 
towels for a bath.

&quot;You don&#39;t really have to be my slave Misaki-chan,&quot; said Hatoko. Misaki 
rememebered the sensation of Hatoko&#39;s lips on hers, and she smiled.

&quot;Ok, but it doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t get to pamper you like a little 
princess...&quot; replied Misaki, have seriously.

&quot;I&#39;ll do the same to you then Misaki-chan,&quot; added Hatoko. They made 
their way to the bathroom. Misaki turned on the hot water and poured 
some bubble solution into it as Hatoko set down the towels. As the 
bathtub filled with water and bubbles, they chatted quietly.

&quot;I wonder if Kotarou-kun will tell Tamayo-chan about our new found 
love...&quot; wondered Misaki.

&quot;Probably, although Tamayo won&#39;t have a fit about it.&quot; replied Hatoko. 
Misaki nodded. She turned around to find the tub brimming with bubbles. 
She turned off the water and helped Hatoko out of her night gown and 
into the tub. Misaki sat down on the side and Hatoko looked at her.

&quot;Misaki-chan, why don&#39;t you come in too?&quot; asked Hatoko.

&quot;There isn&#39;t much space though...&quot; replied Misaki, however she knew that 
she could fit comfortably fairly easy inside the tub with Hatoko.

&quot;Where&#39;s my whip...&quot; said Hatoko pretending to be looking for something.

&quot;Ok ok, you win,&quot; gave in Misaki. She removed her night gown and crawled 
into the tub. Her face was quite red as she sat in the tub opposite 
Hatoko.

&quot;Your cute when you blush Misaki-chan.&quot; mentioned Hatoko. Misaki scooted 
into the tub more to hide her face in the bubbles. Hatoko giggled. She 
couldn&#39;t resist herself any more and crawled closer to Misaki through 
the bubbles. Hatoko loved it when Misaki blushed.

&quot;Hatoko-chan...&quot; mumbled Misaki from behind a wall of bubbles which 
reflected the red hue of Misaki&#39;s face. Hatoko continued to advance on 
Misaki until her face was inches from hers. Hatoko twisted herself 
around and laid down on Misaki as she had always done.

&quot;It&#39;s ok Misaki-chan, don&#39;t worry about anything...&quot; said Hatoko. Misaki 
grew calm at those words, and wrapped her arms around Hatoko.

&quot;Your so wonderful Hatoko-chan... I would have never been able to do 
this if I was with a guy... and guys are different... they&#39;d interpret 
the things that we do wrong, and they&#39;d think that we&#39;re slaves for 
them... I hate that...&quot; whispered Misaki. Hatoko didn&#39;t understand as 
well as Misaki did, but she followed along as best as she could.

&quot;I think I know what you mean Misaki-chan...&quot; replied Hatoko quietly. 
They both silently stared off into space. The bubbles disappeared and 
the water grew cooler as time passed.

&quot;We should get out now Misaki, I&#39;m sure Kotarou-kun and Tamayo-chan are 
wondering if we drowned or not.&quot; whispered Hatoko. Misaki nodded and 
they both got out of the tub. Hatoko ran over to the towels and picked 
them up. She handed one to Misaki as she pulled the stopper out of the 
bottom of the tub.

&quot;Thanks Hatoko-chan,&quot; said Misaki. They both dried themselves and put 
back on their night gowns, as they decided not to bring a change of 
clothes to the bathroom. They turned off the light and head for Misaki&#39;s 
guest room. They met Kotarou and Tamayo on the way.

&quot;Hello Misaki-chan and Hatoko-chan, you sure were in that bathroom for a 
long time... getting dirty are we?&quot; joked Tamayo. Hatoko didn&#39;t get it 
at all and she just stood there as Misaki spoke up.

&quot;Tamayo-chan!?! You wierdo...&quot; said Misaki, just before Tamayo jumped up 
to her. Tamayo gave Misaki and Hatoko a big hug.

&quot;You guys so cute! So cute! I envy your cuteness!&quot; squealed Tamayo. She 
squeezed them even tighter and they gasped for air.

&quot;Tamayo-chan, we can&#39;t breath!&quot; pointed out Hatoko as she struggled to 
get free. Tamayo let go of them and stepped back.

&quot;Heh. Ha ha ha ha ha...&quot; laughed Tamayo with a hand on her head.

&quot;Tamayo-chan...&quot; mumbled Kotarou. He just looked at his wierd 
girlfriend. Tamayo heard him.

&quot;To bad Kotarou isn&#39;t squishy like you guys are...&quot; poked Tamayo. 
Kotarou just had the look of someone uncomfortable that had to put up 
with it. Everyone noticed Kotarou&#39;s odd expression and he blushed.

&quot;Looks like you have a winner there Tamayo-chan,&quot; said Misaki. Tamayo 
looked at her.

&quot;You mean a wiener?&quot; joked Tamayo, again.

&quot;She&#39;s dirty today, don&#39;t mind her!&quot; shouted Kotarou, but it was to 
late, everyone was laughing. Kotarou turned a nice deep red and looked 
at the ground.

After the joke had completely passed, everyone grew quiet and looked at 
the stormy skies. A more violent part of the storm was approaching. Hail 
began to fall from the dark clouds.

&quot;Shall we eat a late breakfast?&quot; suggested Hatoko. Everyone shook their 
heads violently. They all made their way to the kitchen. Kotarou looked 
in the fridge and Hatoko looked in the cupboards. They pulled out some 
fruit and granola bars since that&#39;s all they had for breakfast.

&quot;Let&#39;s see here... Two apples and four granola bars...&quot; said Hatoko.

&quot;It&#39;s all we have... Our parents need to go shopping...&quot; added Kotarou, 
slightly embaressed.

&quot;It&#39;s enough. Kotarou-kun and Tamayo-chan, you get two granola bars and 
an apple. Me and Hatoko-chan will get the rest.&quot; offered Misaki. 
Everyone thought it seemed fair enough. Kotarou grabbed a couple knives 
and they sat down at the kitchen table. Hatoko and Misaki glided into 
two seats right next to each other as Kotarou sat down next to Tamayo, 
blushing.

&quot;They&#39;re still not used to being seen together in front of other 
people,&quot; whispered Misaki into Hatoko&#39;s ear. Hatoko smiled and nodded.

Everyone seemed to want to eat their granola bars first, because they 
did. Kotarou and Tamayo finished first and Kotarou sliced up their apple 
with one of the knives that he had brought over.

&quot;They must be really uncomfortable...&quot; whispered Hatoko to Misaki. She 
finished her granola bar and reached for the apple. She took a bite, a 
nice big bite, and she made sure that Kotarou and Tamayo saw her.

&quot;Hatoko-chan! You have to share that with Misaki-chan!&quot; exclaimed 
Kotarou.

&quot;You know what, your right.&quot; replied Hatoko. She handed the apple to 
Misaki who had just finished her granola bar. Misaki already knew what 
Hatoko&#39;s intentions were and took a big bite out of the apple herself. A 
nice big juicy bite. For all to see. Misaki passed the apple back to 
Hatoko and the cycle continued until the apple was only a core. Kotarou 
and Tamayo snapped out of the trance created by the apple eating 
spectacle.

&quot;We&#39;re such a pathetic couple compared to them Tama...&quot; started Kotarou, 
but was interrupted when he found his mouth full of a half-eaten apple 
slice of Tamayo&#39;s. Kotarou froze. The idea of swallowing the DNA in the 
saliva of Tamayo was... uneasing. He slowly chewed and swallowed the 
piece of apple.

&quot;Correction: Your pathetic,&quot; corrected Tamayo. She just reached over to 
Kotarou and began to squeeze the life out of him. Misaki and Hatoko 
giggled as they snuck out of the kitchen. Busy, Tamayo and Kotarou 
didn&#39;t notice.

Upon reaching the inner walkways on the house/dojo, Misaki and Hatoko 
soon remembered the storm as the freezing wind blew through their loose 
nightgowns. Erratic ice cubes of hail stung their cheeks. A flash of 
light and a crack of thunder came from a short distance away. Misaki 
picked up Hatoko quickly and turned her back to the hail and rain. 
Hatoko clung to her.

&quot;Hang on Hatoko-chan, I&#39;ll run us to my room.&quot; said Misaki. Hatoko 
acknowledged Misaki and held on tight with her arms around Misaki&#39;s 
neck, and her legs wrapped around Misaki&#39;s waist. Misaki ran off to the 
other side of the walkways, carrying Hatoko.

When Misaki arrived with Hatoko at her room and closed the door behind 
them, she was soaking wet from the down pour. A few red marks could be 
seen where large pieces of hail had struck Misaki. Hatoko noticed 
Misaki&#39;s condition.

&quot;Misaki-chan! Your soaking wet and look at those red spots from the 
hail... Are you ok?&quot; asked Hatoko. Misaki smiled as she shivered in her 
wet nightgown.

&quot;I&#39;m fine Hatoko-chan,&quot; replied Misaki.

&quot;Liar,&quot; said Hatoko. She walked over to the closet and pulled out one of 
the spare blankets and brought it back over to Misaki. Misaki had no 
intentions to resist Hatoko and lifted up her arms before Hatoko could 
ask her to.

&quot;You learn quickly Misaki-chan,&quot; noticed Hatoko as she smiled. She 
pulled off the wet night gown and wrapped Misaki in the blanket, then 
dragged her over to the bed.

&quot;What would I do without you Hatoko-chan,&quot; thought Misaki out loud. 
Hatoko laid Misaki down on her bed to warm up, and then climbed on top 
of her just because she wanted to. They lay together in the dim room as 
the sounds of hail slamming into the house continued. Thunder rolled 
along every once in awhile, following the bright flash of lights that 
illuminated the room. The heavy drops of rain only completed the stormy 
picture.

&quot;I have no clue,&quot; replied Hatoko. She snuggled into Misaki and wrapped 
her arms around her. Hatoko couldn&#39;t help herself. The warmth from 
Misaki was intoxicating. She felt like going back to bed once again. She 
closed her eye and let the sounds of the rain and hail lull her to 
sleep, but she was only woken up again by the thunder. A very loud blast 
of thunder that came at the same time that the lightning came. The sound 
of wood splintering could be heard. Hatoko was paralyzed with fear as 
the sound of a large tree crashing into the ground could be heard. She 
dug her face into the blanket that covered Misaki and tightened her 
grip.

&quot;It&#39;ll be ok Hatoko-chan,&quot; whispered Misaki soothingly. Even Misaki was 
scared of the fact that the lightning had done something like that so 
close, but she knew she had to take care of Hatoko as well, and she 
couldn&#39;t let her personal fears get in the way. Hatoko was younger then 
her, and that only made Misaki more willing to suppress her own fears. 
Fear only lead to more fear.

Misaki tilted her head up, as well as Hatoko&#39;s, and kissed her softly on 
the forehead.

&quot;It&#39;ll be ok Hatoko-chan,&quot; she repeated quietly.
