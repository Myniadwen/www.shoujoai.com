Hatoko and Misaki had fallen asleep shortly after their pirate show. 
Kotarou decided that spying on them wasn&#39;t worth it anymore. Girls were 
donwright vicious he concluded, glancing at his legs. They bore the 
tell-tale signs of being knocked about by two damp towels.

&quot;Must be... Hmm... Must be called &#39;Female Battle Frenzy&#39;... I think...&quot; 
he mumbled to himself as he stood up and wobbled away. A grin spread 
across his face as stepped inside of his room and closed the door behind 
him. A flash of lightning sounded in the distance. The rain, which had 
recently stopped, was now on its way back.

---

Hatoko awoke to the tinkling of rain outside of the room. Misaki was 
still absorbed in her slumber, her mouth slightly open as she took 
small, slow breaths. Hatoko listened to her, hearing the almost 
inaudiable coo from her lips. Her hair was not held back, and was in a 
cascading disarray that fell across the front of her neck, in Hatoko&#39;s 
direction.

&quot;Misaki must have turned to face me in her dreams...&quot; thought Hatoko, 
the daze of just waking made her slow in her thinking. A pink hue danced 
upon her pale cheeks as her emotions awoke. Hatoko, not resisting, 
scooted closer to Misaki and wrapped her arms around her love. Her 
eternal love, as far as she was concerned.

Misaki stirred, and finally opened her eyes as Hatoko&#39;s nose brushed 
against her cheek. She brought her arms around Hatoko and the two stared 
into each others sleepy eyes not saying a word.

The clock told them it was time to get up. Time to leave the warm 
confines of the bed. Time to leave each other&#39;s arms. Time for a day of 
school.

---

Hatoko was downcast as she brushed her hair, and Misaki had already told 
her many times not to give in to the bullies who had once called her a 
friend. Hatoko knew Misaki was right, but still she didn&#39;t like the 
feeling of being without Misaki for so long.

&quot;Hatoko-chan, you need to keep your head today. Your wits and wisdom. 
Don&#39;t let them get to you. Stand by your feelings and they won&#39;t let you 
down.&quot; Misaki whispered into Hatoko&#39;s ear. She took the brush from 
Hatoko&#39;s small hand and witha few caressing strokes she finished taming 
Hatoko&#39;s hair. A glance at the clock told them it was time to go.

Little was said to Kotarou that morning, he was still getting ready as 
they left. Of course, Kotarou didn&#39;t have to take his little sister to 
school that day. Hatoko turned her eyes away from the school grounds 
when she saw them. Misaki noticed this, and glanced towards them. She 
noticed a few people looking at them, and without thinking about it any 
further, she made her way past the fence straight for them. Hatoko 
noticed Misaki&#39;s sudden rigidness. Looking up, she found an angry 
expression set on Misaki&#39;s face.

&quot;Misaki-chan...&quot; whispered Hatoko, almost to the point that Misaki 
couldn&#39;t hear. Misaki didn&#39;t look at Hatoko. She strode forward quietly, 
her age and status giving the impression of preparing to strike down 
from the heavens as she made her way to the group of children. They had 
turned away as Misaki entered the school grounds hoping to blend in with 
the rest of the children who were splashing around in the puddles in the 
brief absence of rain.

Misaki stopped only inches from the first child who had been staring at 
her and Hatoko. Her dull shadow enveloped the small child, and she 
turned around prepared to stand her ground.

&quot;Eww... It&#39;s Hato-&quot; she was cut off.

&quot;I&#39;m here to set things straight. If you ever harm my Hatoko-chan again 
your going to feel it.&quot; Misaki paused momentarily. The confidence in the 
younger child, and her friends, faded instantly at Misaki&#39;s unusally 
hard voice. The fact she was older then them, and the Champion of 
Angelic Layer in the past year, forced many to take a few steps back.

&quot;And another thing... You say your sorry now,&quot; her voice commanded 
respect. Hatoko couldn&#39;t hold back her pride and love for Misaki, she 
never thought she&#39;d take advantage of her status to this extent. It was 
working, however.

It was one thing to attack a peer, and a completly different thing to 
stand and face a idol known throughout the country. The children&#39;s eyes 
turned from stubborn hate to attentiveness, and now they were slowly 
changing to a sullen, respectful glance. They&#39;re eyes were on Misaki, 
then Hatoko. Hatoko, feeling the confidence in herself welling up, 
stared right back at them. The only child refusing to look at Misaki and 
Hatoko was the young girl that had originally splashed paint onto 
Hatoko&#39;s uniform. She brought her head up, and after glaring at Misaki 
with all the spite she could muster, ran away. Misaki stood unphased.

&quot;Say it.&quot; demanded Misaki. Her voice fell on the others. The crowd of 
other young children, and even the older ones, watched as the children 
said sorry one after the other. A few even went as far as to give Hatoko 
a hug. The young classmates waited for someone to acknowledge their 
display of apologies.

&quot;Hatoko-chan, do you think they can be forgiven?&quot; asked Hatoko, trying 
to get Hatoko to resolve her mind as if the question was idling within. 
Hatoko looked at Misaki, and then her past friends.

&quot;I forgive you,&quot; she announced, if somewhat quietly. Hatoko&#39;s classmates 
semed happy that they had made up, but Hatoko was still angry at them, 
and it showed in her face. Misaki bent down to look Hatoko at eye level. 
The classmates stayed silent, even though one from far away might think 
it laughable.

&quot;I think they will be your friends, when the time comes, Hatoko-chan.&quot; 
whispered Misaki so silently that the group of children around them only 
saw moving lips, but heard no sounds.

&quot;Thank you, Misaki-chan...&quot; Hatoko whispered back just as quietly. Her 
eyes had gone a bit watery by now, thanking Misaki for getting her at 
least some room to breath. Misaki saw this, and gave Hatoko a warm hug. 
The school, now completely silent (as everyone had been watching), just 
stared with wide eyes.

Hatoko didn&#39;t want Misaki to leave, but she knew she had too. Misaki 
pulled away and giving Hatoko one last glance, dashed off to her school. 
The chances were high that she would be late, but right now it didn&#39;t 
matter. Her heart told she had done what she should have. Hatoko would 
be able to learn today without this horrible burden, at least for the 
most part. The young girl that ran away seemed to still be a part of the 
problem, but Misaki doubted she would bother Hatoko for at least today. 
Misaki didn&#39;t think twice about being late for school if it meant Hatoko 
would have a better day.

---

Misaki glared at her language teacher the entire day. Misaki wasn&#39;t 
afraid of her in the least, and she figured it was probably the other 
way around. The teacher tried her best to avoid eye contact with Misaki, 
but every once in awhile her eyes betrayed her and stole glances back at 
Misaki. Each time the teacher had done this she lost her words for a 
moment, and then turning away, continued with her lesson. Being the last 
class of the day, Misaki was especially tired, but kept up her defiant 
attitude. The class was whispering near the end, curious to as why the 
teacher, the language teacher in particular, was acting like she had 
seen a ghost every five or ten minutes. There eyes were all watching her 
for a change, and a noticeable murmur arose each time she broke off her 
train of thought. The class seemed to be enjoying it actually.

&quot;She must really be a witch,&quot; whispered one student. Images of a wild 
green witch floated through the class&#39; mind, dropping piles of homework 
onto student&#39;s laps, and trying to speak to them through an odd 
assortment of hiccups, pops, and even a few belly belches. No one 
noticed Misaki&#39;s death stare of sorts.

---

The events in the language class spread like wildfire throughout the 
school. Misaki left the room, catching her teacher one last time with 
her blank stare as she left the class room. Her teacher watched her go, 
and after the last few students had left, locked herself in the 
classroom. A dozen students heard this, and it too spread like wildfire, 
even though Misaki never intended for the stare to start these rumors 
and such.

Misaki left the school in a run. She didn&#39;t take out her umbrella even 
as the rain began to pour down. All she wanted to do was to see Hatoko, 
and make sure she had made it through the day without a problem. She 
longed for Hatoko to have a full day without annoyance.

The opening in the fence came into view, and Misaki turned onto the 
school grounds to find Hatoko flying towards her with a smile. Misaki&#39;s 
heart gave a great sigh of relief, and at the same time, leapt out of 
her chest. &quot;Hatoko-chan!&quot; she cried as Hatoko flung herself into 
Misaki&#39;s arms. The embrace was warm and pure. Hatoko finally had a good 
day at school.

&quot;Today was... wonderful! My friends came and had lunch with me! It&#39;s all 
thanks to you, Misaki-chan...&quot; Hatoko&#39;s eyes sparkled even the rain. She 
clamped herself onto Misaki&#39;s wet clothes and swung her arms around 
Misaki&#39;s neck. And despite the onlooking face, Hatoko stretched up and 
gave Misaki a light kiss on the cheeks.

A blush crept onto the twos&#39; faces. Hatoko let go of Misaki and slid of, 
taking her right hand. She and Misaki began the walk home in high 
spirits.

---

Upon arriving back at Hatoko&#39;s house, Kotarou, who was already home, 
handed Misaki a letter, which took her quite by suprise. The two made 
off for Hatoko&#39;s room to get out of their wet clothes and put on 
something warm and comfortable.

After changing, Misaki sat next to Hatoko on her bed and looked at the 
letter. It was from her mother. A longing in Misaki&#39;s heart to see her 
mother suddenly grew, as she hadn&#39;t seen her for some time. She had gone 
off to talk to medical institutes in North America to try and promote 
the artifical limbs she had been working on for years with that wierd 
docter the Misaki fondly remembered.

Misaki opened the letter and removed the contents. It read:


Dear Misaki-chan,

It has been some time, but I assure you we&#39;ll catch up some more when I 
get back from this trip. It seems promising already, and I&#39;m very happy 
about it.

I&#39;ve heard that you and Hatoko-cahn have realized your feelings for each 
other. When I was young, I remeber the same thing happening to me. I 
feel in love with a girl from a grade lower then me right before I left 
elementary school. However, after a year we split apart. My interest in 
boys grew to the point that I denied to myself that I ever liked a girl 
with so much love and passion.

She is still my friend... but it seems as if there is a rift between us. 
There must be, we hardly ever talk anymore. Well, my best wishes to you 
and Hatoko-chan. I&#39;m sure your relationship will last a lifetime.

Shuuko


Misaki&#39;s heart skipped a beat. Hatoko hadn&#39;t caught on yet. Misaki found 
herself fighting out words to confirm it with herself, and to tell 
Hatoko what she thought it meant.

&quot;She loved... a... girl... A girl Hatoko-chan...&quot; Misaki stared blankly 
at Hatoko, &quot;She saying her love was a phase.&quot;

Hatoko understood Misaki now. The letter fell from Misaki&#39;s hands to the 
floor as let herself fall onto Hatoko&#39;s bed. Hatoko knew Misaki was 
fearing for the sake of their relationship now, as was herself. She felt 
light headed at the thought, and turned around to cuddle onto Misaki, 
tears already escaping her eyes.
