(Listens to Angelic Layer Album)

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Angelic Deus

&quot;When in doubt you are suffocating your heart. Let it breathe.&quot; unknown 
source

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Hatoko walked into the large building alone, save for the dolls in each 
hand. She had brought Suzuka and Misaki-chan with her. Several pairs of 
eyes were already on her, recognition in their face. She had been the 
second for the current champion of Angelic Layer for two years now, and 
her name warranted great respect from the Angelic Layer community.

&quot;Kobayashi-san, I have your layer reservation over there. Please follow 
me.&quot; said an attendant, leading the child to a layer into the corner.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hatoko replied, sitting down at the layer and setting her 
angels on the edge. Immediately a group assembled around her.

&quot;Where is Misaki-sama?&quot; They asked, seemingly all at the same time.

&quot;She is not available today, however, I received specific instructions 
from her to come up with an analysis for this prototype angel. It was 
named Misaki-chan after her.&quot; Hatoko explained, matter-of-factly.

&quot;May I try, Kobayashi-san.&quot; One asked hesitantly, and Hatoko nodded.

&quot;While Misaki is unavailable to play with me, I wouldn&#39;t mind teaching 
you a few things.&quot; Hatoko replied, setting the control headset on her 
head and switching it on. She removed Suzuka from the layer and rested 
the well-known angel on her lap.

&quot;Okay, Misaki-chan, can you hear me?&quot; Hatoko thought, and the angel 
stood, faced her, and nodded. &quot;As I thought, you can still receive 
messages from the headset.&quot;

&quot;Umm... Are you ready?&quot; asked the opponent cautiously. Hatoko nodded.

&quot;Do your best. You are fighting against an angel much more powerful then 
Suzuka.&quot;

A bystander signaled the start of the fight, and Misaki took charge. 
Hatoko leaned back in her chair and watched.

Misaki-chan dashed to the middle of the layer in a split second. The 
enemy angel, named Kuu, raced into the middle as well, arm raised, 
prepared to strike. Misaki-chan dodged it. The angel struck again, and 
again. Misaki-chan, under the expert control of the champion danced 
through each attack flawlessly. Hatoko&#39;s opponent&#39;s face contorted into 
several weird shapes as the match progressed.

&quot;Arg, stay still!&quot; the teenager called, but to no avail, Misaki-chan 
rolled over the sweeping kick. Another couple minutes passed, and 
Misaki-chan decided to end it. The enemy did a running jump kick, and 
Misaki-chan deftly caught the opposing angel&#39;s foot in her hold. She 
twisted around and let the momentum in the enemy fly the angel off the 
layer, into the lap of the stunned Deus.

&quot;Chiyo-chan, remember that you must use a greater variety of attacks, 
while you did not manage to hit Misaki-chan, you only used three 
different attacks.&quot; Hatoko explained, and the girl in front of her 
nodded.

&quot;I will remember that, Kobayashi-san.&quot; Chiyo replied nervously, setting 
the headset down on the chair and leaving the seat open for the next 
challenger. &quot;I also want to add... That angel is beautiful. It reminds 
me of Hikaru and Athena.&quot;

&quot;It hides more secrets, and if any wish to see them, they must land a 
hit on Misaki-chan.&quot; Hatoko replied, only to receive a response from 
Jounouchi Sai, who had been watching the competition closely. Kaede was 
at her side of course.

&quot;I wish to challenge this angel, Hatoko-chan.&quot; Sai offered, sitting down 
at the chair that Chiyo had just left. A large gathering of people had 
surrounded the table now, with many recognizable faces amongst the 
aspiring ones. The fact that Sai and Kaede were there watching surprised 
Hatoko, and she wondered just how much of an inside connection they had 
with Angelic Layer Co.

&quot;Sai-san, how much do you already know about this angel?&quot; Hatoko asked, 
gazing at Sai intently.

&quot;I have heard many things. I know the truth behind it. I admire you and 
Misaki-sama for your dedication.&quot; Sai responded, and many people looked 
at the two Deuses quizzically, but asked nothing.

&quot;Then you realize your chances of hitting it are next to nothing.&quot; 
Hatoko warned, and Sai nodded.

&quot;Then this is merely practice.&quot; Sai responded, throwing her angel onto 
the layer.

&quot;Misaki-chan, hold nothing back.&quot; Hatoko thought, and the angel nodded, 
turning around to face the highly respected Shirahime. &quot;Fight with your 
heart, this is your fight, not mine.&quot;

&quot;Fighto!&quot; Kaede called, waving her hand down to start the match. 
Shirahime charged at Misaki-chan. Misaki-chan easily dodged the 
resulting kick, twisting around in the blink of an eye to land a 
counter-kick on Shirahime. Sai showed no emotion on her face, and 
continued to bat at the elusive angel, however Misaki-chan moved so 
smoothly, it was hard to tell she moved without a pattern. Sai had 
trouble predicting the angel&#39;s next move every time, and found herself 
beginning to take decent amounts of damage from Misaki-chan&#39;s counters. 
It was several minutes before Shirahime landed a blow, and it was a 
light one at that, as Misaki-chan pulled back to ease to damage off.

&quot;As promised,&quot; Hatoko replied to this, and Misaki-chan jumped high off 
of the layer&#39;s surface. A flash of light filled the layer, and after it 
had passed, Misaki-chan&#39;s wings were flapping in the air. Excitement 
stirred in the crowd of onlookers. Shirahime looked up in awe at the 
display, along with Sai.

&quot;The Angel of the Sea has become unstoppable now.&quot; Sai commented, and 
Kaede nodded slightly. Shirahime could not deal well with angels that 
could fly, and even though Shirahime still had much of her health left, 
a flying attack could send the heavy angel off the layer by sheer force. 
But this did not happen.

&quot;Misaki, why aren&#39;t you striking?&quot; Hatoko thought, and the shining angel 
soon showed her why. A mysteriously patterned sphere enveloped 
Misaki-chan, and two shafts of light extended like infinitely long 
batons from her hands, burning the air in the layer and creating great 
ripples in the sides of the energy field.

&quot;No way...&quot; Kaede started as she recognized the pattern, &quot;The skill 
Angelic Layer Co. said was not possible, but rumor has circulated the 
Internet for some time...&quot;

&quot;Total Energy Control, it has many forms, but this is one of the more 
recognized.&quot; Sai responded. Hatoko gazed at the beautiful display, 
almost forgetting she was supposed to be pretending to control the 
angel.

The beams moved swiftly, and with deadly precision, cut through 
Shirahime in two fell strokes. The angel dropped to the layer in defeat, 
to a senseless, wordless crowd. The beams disappeared, and Misaki-chan 
glided to the surface, picking the fallen angel up. Misaki walked to the 
edge of the layer that Sai sat at, and handed the angel back to her.

&quot;Misaki-sama.&quot; Sai whispered, surprised at the sudden defeat. &quot;It would 
take an army to stop this angel. It is more powerful then anything 
Angelic Layer has ever seen. Athena and Hikaru are barely a match for 
this one.&quot; The crowd of onlookers seemingly forgot to cheer on Hatoko 
and Sai, staring at the glorious angel as it danced around on the layer. 
&quot;But, this is truly her...&quot; Sai finished.

&quot;Hatoko-chan, mind if I ask you a question in private?&quot; Sai asked, and 
Hatoko shook her head. Taking their angels, they made their way out of 
the building, Kaede following at the side of Sai, of course.

&quot;Kobayashi-san, umm... May we use this layer while you are gone?&quot; asked 
one of the Deuses, and Hatoko nodded smiling as she stepped onto the 
escalator. A few minutes later, Hatoko was sitting with Sai and Kaede on 
a park bench.

&quot;Hatoko-chan... We have been talking about what happened to Misaki-sama 
these last few days...&quot; Sai started hesitantly. Hatoko listened quietly. 
&quot;It... It has left an impression on us.&quot;

&quot;What was that?&quot; Hatoko asked softly.

&quot;Well, me and... and...&quot; Sai began, finding herself unable to finish.

&quot;Sai and I decided to take our relationship a step further a few days 
before the incident occurred. We were informed about it the day after it 
happened, and it struck us in that moment how easily life was destroyed. 
We had taken each other&#39;s company for granted for such a long time...&quot; 
Kaede said as Sai looked at her hands in her lap.

&quot;Love is wonderful, isn&#39;t it, Sai-san, Kaede-san?&quot; Hatoko asked quietly. 
They nodded their heads in unison. &quot;It is that feeling that you must 
protect and cherish.&quot;

&quot;You would know... At least, for a little bit, you knew... What it was 
like to be alone.&quot; Kaede replied.

&quot;Yes. It felt like all happiness in the world had vanished. Vanished so 
completely that every last good memory had been twisted into a painful 
one.&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean, Hatoko-chan,&quot; Sai replied. &quot;I felt like that for 
sometime. I cried so much, I thought I was losing my mind.&quot;

&quot;Your sister?&quot; Hatoko asked. Sai nodded.

&quot;But I felt it again... Again... When I heard Misaki-sama had been 
murdered...&quot; Sai looked away, hiding the glimmer of a tear in her eye. 
&quot;She means so much to so many people. She has affected so many people, 
given them hope that no matter who they were, they could do something. 
But, selfishly I must say, Misaki-sama has given the most hope to me.&quot;

Hatoko looked at Sai, absorbing the words as if Sai was giving a piece 
of Misaki to her. Kaede, who sat on the other side of Hatoko, looked at 
Sai as well.

&quot;After my sister passed away, I forgot how to share love. It was as if 
my love died with her. I grew depressed soon after, with only Kaede at 
my side. She kept me going, but I could never regrasp that lost emotion. 
I only wanted to see my sister&#39;s face again, to hold her close to me and 
tell her I loved her.&quot; Sai lowered her head into her hands. &quot;But I 
couldn&#39;t and my heart shut tight, not wanting to lose someone so special 
again.

&quot;My pain grew with each passing day, and Angelic Layer was my only 
escape. I forced the memories into the back of my mind and concentrated 
on Angelic Layer for years, advancing together with Kaede. It was only 
till a few days ago it worked. The emotion finally caught up to me, and 
the picture of her on my desk tore me to pieces that night. I called 
Kaede.&quot; Sai looked up, several tears running to her chin.

&quot;Kaede, the angel she really is, was at my door in an instant. She let 
herself in, and made her way to my room. I told myself I would never cry 
again, but that night, I cried those years out. All the years of 
loneliness, and loss. Kaede made me change into nightclothes, and put me 
to bed. Without thinking, I asked her to stay with me that night quite 
suddenly, and she said she would, without a moment of hesitation.

&quot;She held me that night like a mother would hold a child, and it hit me 
that Kaede was waiting for this moment for a very long time. There were 
more tears, and realizations, but I&#39;m sure you already know all about 
it.&quot; Hatoko was wiping away her own tears now, remembering when she 
discovered with Misaki their special relationship.

&quot;You have something wonderful,&quot; Hatoko replied, and Sai smiled a small 
smile.

&quot;Now I remember how it feels to have someone special, and, I also 
realized, Misaki-sama is special to me too. She is what thousands of 
people strive to be, who thousands look up to. I am fortunate enough to 
know you two, and I don&#39;t want to pass up this opportunity to help. Me 
and Kaede want to help Misaki-sama live once more.&quot;

Hatoko looked into Sai&#39;s eyes, and saw that she wasn&#39;t about to give up 
on her decision.

&quot;I&#39;ll talk to Icchan-san and Shuuko-san, I would love for both of you to 
come, but it is not entirely my decision. Also, here, seeing we are 
alone.&quot; Hatoko handed Sai her Misaki-chan angel. Sai took it gently. 
Misaki-chan stood up in Sai&#39;s palm and looked at her face.

&quot;Misaki-sama,&quot; Sai began.

&quot;Come... With Us... You Will...&quot; Misaki whispered, and Sai listened 
silently. Kaede flinched at the sound of Misaki&#39;s voice, only to recover 
herself and move closer to Hatoko to hear it better. &quot;You love... 
Greater asset... there is not.&quot;

The sea blue angel spread her wings, to the older girls&#39; delight, and 
flew over to Kaede, landing softly on her lap.

&quot;Kaede-san... Knew very long... Her love... Proof... Of strong soul... 
Strong heart.&quot; Misaki said softly, and Kaede smiled down at the angel. 
&quot;Hatoko-chan... Show them... What true strength of heart... Truly is...&quot;

Hatoko undid the clasp on the chain around her neck, and pulling the 
glowing pendant out from under two layers of clothing, held the shining 
object up for Sai and Kaede, who watched intently. The warm light washed 
over them, and Sai now scooted closer to Hatoko to get a better look. 
Hatoko could barely fidget now, but she hardly noticed.

&quot;This is Misaki&#39;s soul, all I have of Misaki right now. Misaki is trying 
to say that love, when strong enough, is more important and more 
valuable then anything else. True love is immortal. Misaki refused to 
leave me, and now, while not whole, her soul rests next to my heart 
every moment of everyday.&quot; Hatoko explained.

&quot;So this is her soul... Beautiful, isn&#39;t it, Sai?&quot; Kaede said, and Sai 
nodded. &quot;I want her to be whole again. I want to hold her and tell her 
thank you. Her dedication to Angelic Layer, and to her mother, and to 
Hatoko-chan... it inspired me to chase Sai this long. Not to mention, 
Misaki-sama was killed... And she is still here with Hatoko-chan. It is 
a great feat.&quot;

Hatoko looked at the ground now. Sai and Kaede turned to look at her.

&quot;There is something you must know before we allow you to go. Fate has 
presented us with mysterious powers, but it has also taken away some of 
our liberties. Misaki can die from loneliness, forever. We must not fail 
to discover the truth behind these dreams, and all things else, or 
Misaki may never return.&quot; Hatoko explained, raising her hand palm up. It 
filled with water.

&quot;We won&#39;t fail you, Misaki-sama, and Hatoko-chan.&quot; promised Sai as she 
dipped her fingers into the cool water in Hatoko&#39;s hand.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Author&#39;s Notes:

Well, that&#39;s it for now. As I said earlier, I won&#39;t be updating for four 
or five days, possibly a week. It all depends on my ability to write 
while on my trip. Ja ne!
