Prologue

The world is progressing day by day. Within it, the thing that continues 
to progress the most is electronic technology, and in that- its 
connection to toys. Now, the number one thing this is leading to is a 
&quot;World of Toys.&quot; The first of these toys is the egg that came from a 
dream, &quot;Angel Egg.&quot; If one with an egg shows wisdom, love, and courage, 
they can raise it into an &quot;angel.&quot; That&#39;s Angelic Layer. 

----------

	Blackness...darkness...burning, swirling...that was the way I saw 
everything when I was not being used by my deus...my beloved creator and 
deus, Misaki Suzuhara who was fondly nicknamed Misakichi. Whether I was 
being carried around or resting or lying down upon somewhere, I could 
not tell where I was. I could hear as Misaki rushed around doing 
something. A party...I believe that&#39;s what she told me this morning as 
she awoke. But why was it then that I felt excitement? I was just an 
angel, wasn&#39;t I? I couldn&#39;t...shouldn&#39;t feel any emotions. But if that 
was so...then what was that sound?

Dokidoki...

	Had I been unaware of my surroundings, as limited as it were as of 
the moment, I could hear that sound...

Dokidoki... Dokidoki...

	It was a familiar sound. It was not foreign, nor endangering to 
me...for I had heard it many times when I lay close to Misaki as she 
slept. But why would I hear a heartbeat? I&#39;m merely an angel...I&#39;m not 
living. Although at times, I wonder why I can think to myself like I&#39;m 
doing right now. I don&#39;t know when it started, but I have a feeling that 
it happened after I got my wings. Feeling? I&#39;m an angel...I&#39;m not 
supposed to be able to feel anything. After all, I&#39;m not human...right? 
What...what is wrong with me? Why am I able to feel like this? I can 
hear another sound in the quiet silence. It is also another sound that 
I&#39;ve heard before. I believe that Misaki called it doorbell. It&#39;s used 
when one gets visitors. I don&#39;t know how much time before I hear the 
doorbell once again. This time after I heard the door close, I heard 
footsteps approaching. The soft steps that I&#39;ve grown accustomed to 
being Misaki&#39;s. I could feel myself being gently lifted up in those 
soft, if somewhat big fingers of Misaki&#39;s. As I lay there in her hands, 
I could feel the wind softly blow my hair around as Misaki bore me off 
to...where I don&#39;t know. All of a sudden I could hear...hear much more 
noise than that of before. It wasn&#39;t the cheers of fans in some 
tournament; so I assumed it was either the TV or the friends that Misaki 
told me about this morning at had arrived. It was apparent that her 
friends were playing with other angels on the portable layer that deus 
Misaki had at home. After a few minutes had passed, at least I thought 
it was a few minutes; it was hard to tell time in darkness. I felt the 
cool rush of wind on my face again as Misaki put me down somewhere. I 
could tell that it was the feel of something soft as I laid 
down...carpet, I thought. From somewhere up high, I could hear Misaki&#39;s 
childish voice speaking...her words drifting to my ear...

&quot;Come now, everyone,&quot; said Misaki with a clap. &quot;Time for dinner.&quot;

	There was a cheer...Tamayo, I suspected. She loved deus&#39; Misaki&#39;s 
food so much. I smiled inwardly...so much happiness. Was this what it 
meant to be human? To be able to feel, think and experience? Lost in my 
thoughts, I suddenly found that the company that Misaki had moved 
elsewhere. I was suddenly struck with a notion...if I were able to 
think, feel and experience things that no other angel could, did that 
mean that I could possibly see as well? My eyes were closed at the 
moment, but did not matter. I had to try. I summoned all my feelings to 
try to open my eyes so that I may see into the world. At first I could 
feel that my eyes were clenching, tensing...Slowly, oh so slowly, my 
eyes opened. I could finally see what were I was. Opening my eyes fully 
and blinking...I could blink just like I&#39;ve seen people do, I looked 
around. Everything looked so big, but then again everything to me has 
always been big. I was just an angel after all. I can&#39;t begin to 
describe my feelings, my joy of being able to see and not just being 
limited to the layer...it was indescribable. Was this how people felt? 
Now, I had to wonder...if I could see, could I move under my own power? 
I had my doubts about this one, but I concentrated...tried to move my 
arms, my legs, just like Misaki controlled me in layer. I looked down at 
my arms as I suddenly felt my hand clenching and making a fist. I 
unclenched and tried my left hand as well. It worked...I could actually 
move on my own. I was thrilled. Now if I could stand. Thinking, willing 
my legs to move, I could see as I brought my legs up and moving my arms, 
I wrapped my arms around my legs as I brought them up.

	Now I smiled. This was great! I was moving like a person. How I 
could control myself without Misaki was something that wasn&#39;t lost on 
me. I constantly wondered how I could do this. I had spotted the 
portable layer behind me. I had been propped up against the side of it, 
but I had moved myself out and away from the layer side just a little 
bit. Getting an idea, I rolled onto my back and threw my arms back, palm 
side up beside my head. Bringing my legs up, I arched my back up before 
throwing my legs back down in an angle as I used my hands to push up. I 
believe I heard people and deus call this move a kip-hop. Finally I was 
standing, but for a little while I wobbled, as I could not get my 
balance. Flailing my arms a bit in effort to keep my balance, I finally 
stood up straight. I had to admit that it was like standing in the 
layer, except I wasn&#39;t in the layer at all. I glanced around me...where 
were the other angels? After a second pass of glancing around, I could 
see the other angels propped against the layer as well. I noticed that 
the only angel that was even close to me was the white angel that 
belonged to the deus Kaede Saito...Blanche. The other angels were on the 
other side...

	I wondered...could other angels move just like I did? Surely the 
others deus loved their angels and cared for them as much as Misaki 
cared for me, surely they could do what I was able to do...couldn&#39;t 
they? Turning to my nearest companion, the white angel, Blanche, I knelt 
down next to her side. It was obvious that Kaede loved her and took care 
of her. Blanche was lying down, her head propped up against the portable 
layer&#39;s side. Her hands were folded in her lap and she seemed peaceful. 
For some reason, I felt compelled to say something...anything. But could 
I speak? It was something that I never considered. I needed to try...

&quot;Ah...&quot;

	I was startled. Did I really have the function to talk? To speak? 
I had to try again to make sure it wasn&#39;t a fluke...

&quot;Ah...&quot;

	It wasn&#39;t fluke...I really could talk? Now, I must say that I&#39;m 
just angel, but after discovering I could somewhat speak, I felt faint. 
I guess it was a little overwhelming? I just stood for a minute, trying 
to contain the joy that I felt that I was able to speak...well, able to 
with practice. Shaking myself out of my reverie, I glanced down at 
Blanche. Could she move and talk like I could? Could the other angels do 
like I did? Well, there was one way to find out, even though I hated to 
disturb Blanche...she looked so cute, just lying there. Cute? Where had 
that thought come from? Shaking my head to clear my thoughts, I knelt 
down next to her...Blanche. I reached out with a shaky hand and touched 
her on the shoulder, trying to rouse her. What was I so nervous about 
anyway? I shook Blanche gently. I waited, seeing if she would react. 
Slowly, just as slowly as I had done, Blanche opened her beautiful 
orange tinted eyes. She took my breath away for just an instant as I 
looked at her silently...

			*			*			*

	Slowly, I awoke. Had Kaede-sama summoned me to fight for her 
again? If that was so, then why couldn&#39;t I move? Blinking, I looked 
around as much as I could. Let me see...familiar ceiling; Misaki-sama&#39;s 
home. Why was I here? Thinking back, I recalled Kaede-sama telling me 
about a party she was going to later that day. Was she at Misaki-sama&#39;s 
home? Apparently so, since I glanced to my right and there was Misaki&#39;s 
angel, Hikaru. I blinked again. She was just kneeling...looking at me. I 
could feel myself being drawn into those pink, light crimson eyes of 
hers. My breath caught in my throat as she smiled at me...

			*			*			*

	She was awake. Blanche had woken up. There were other angels like 
me! Not knowing what else to do, I smiled at her. After a minute, I saw 
that Blanche was not smiling at all. She still had that neutral look on 
her face. Almost frowning, I stood up and offered my hand. Surely, she 
could move...right?

			*			*			*

	I felt suddenly uncomfortable. I blinked. When did angels have the 
ability to feel unless their deus felt something? I could see that 
Hikaru was obviously not in the layer, as I was not as well. Hikaru had 
offered me her hand to help me up. She must have thought that I could 
move as she could. Summoning my strength, I tried my best to lift at 
least my hand...

			*			*			*

	I took a closer look at Blanche. I don&#39;t know, but she looked a 
little nervous, even a little uncomfortable. I knelt back down at 
Blanche&#39;s side. I was worried...what was wrong? I caught Blanche&#39;s eyes 
occasionally glancing down. Following her gaze, I looked down. Blinking, 
I saw her arms twitch, relax and then fall limp. Looking at her legs, I 
saw the same thing happening. Poor Blanche. She couldn&#39;t move like I 
did...not without the layer, I realized. Glancing up, I saw that 
Misaki-chan and her friends had left the layer on. The proverbial light 
bulb switched on as I got an idea. Kneeling down once again, I slid one 
of my arms under Blanche&#39;s legs. Using my other arm to support Blanche 
from behind, I lifted her up into my arms...

			*			*			*

	I feel myself being lifted by Hikaru. Hikaru didn&#39;t look that 
strong, but I knew she was. I would have gasped if I could for Hikaru 
had leapt high toward the layer...

			*			*			*

	I crouched and concentrated. Using the strength that came from 
being a speed type angel, I leapt up toward the layer. It wasn&#39;t that 
high, but since I was on normal ground, I had to take other precautions. 
As I shot into the air, I could feel the wind stinging my cheeks and it 
felt wonderful. As we began our descent, I could feel as Blanche gained 
control of her limbs and her body, for she clutched me around the neck 
with her arms. I smiled as I came to a gentle landing on my feet and I 
let Blanche down on the layer. Her eyes said thank you and she gave a 
smile that I had seen on only one other person, Kaede Saito-san. It was 
the blessed &#39;Heaven&#39;s Smile&#39; and for a minute I could not say anything 
or think of anything. That smile took my breath away and I didn&#39;t even 
realize that I was blushing until Blanche walked forward and touched my 
cheeks softly with her gloved hands. I turned away so Blanche wouldn&#39;t 
see the blush on my cheeks. Peeking back at her, I saw Blanche tilt her 
head a little, curiously. I turned back. Hopefully the blush was gone. I 
decided to say something. Perhaps she could speak if she saw that I 
could too. What could I say? What...?

&quot;Bla...Blanche.&quot;

	Was that my voice? I didn&#39;t know I sounded like that. It 
felt...nice to know that I could speak. I saw Blanche blink in surprise. 
I guess she was wondering how I could speak at all...

			*			*			*

	I blinked. Did Hikaru just speak? My thoughts were running 
rampant. When did angels speak? How did Hikaru do that? Her voice 
sounded heavenly and SO sweet. I didn&#39;t know if I could talk, but if 
Hikaru could then perhaps I could. I smiled and clapped my hands. It was 
just amazing. I nodded...I hope Hikaru understood that she had gotten my 
name right...

			*			*			*

	Oh be still my beating heart...that was my first thought as 
Blanche smiled that heavenly smile again. I hoped she liked my voice. I 
think she understood. I got her name right then...I hope. Pointing at 
myself, I wanted to tell her my name...

&quot;Hi...Hikaru.&quot;

	I waited. Hopefully, Blanche could pick up on the language and 
started talking to me too. I clasped my hands together, waiting...

			*			*			*

	I nodded happily. I sure hope I could do this. I took a breath and 
tried to speak, but nothing happened. Blinking I touched my throat. Was 
something wrong with my voice? I suddenly felt so upset that I couldn&#39;t 
talk to Hikaru. My feelings must have been apparent on my face for when 
I looked up Hikaru looked sad...

			*			*			*

	I felt bad and looked down at the shining layer. 
Blanche...COULDN&#39;T talk at all? Why couldn&#39;t she? Why? Why? Now I felt 
SO bad for talking at all. I heaved a sigh and wondered how Blanche 
could be made to talk? If I could learn enough, I could teach her. Now I 
gave myself a mental boot to the head. If I could have Misaki-chan teach 
me, I could teach Blanche. Hearing a sudden noise loud enough to reach 
me, since I could tell it came from the direction of the dining room, I 
got worried. Were Misaki-chan and her friends already done? I glanced at 
Blanche and my worries were well founded. Blanche was clearly worried 
and so was I. I had to act fast or else Blanche and I were going to be 
discovered. Looking into Blanche&#39;s eyes for an instant, I could see that 
she understood what I was about to do. Quickly, I dashed over to her 
position and with one smooth motion; Blanche was in my arms again. She 
clung tight to me as I made for the outside of the layer...

			*			*			*

	I felt something was wrong when Hikaru looked at me. She was 
worried and it showed in her eyes. I nodded slightly to tell her I 
understood. In the blink of an eye, I was in her arms. Clutching her 
tightly, I watched as the edge of the layer drew closer and closer. The 
instant, Hikaru passed through the edge of the layer, I could feel 
myself losing control of my arms, legs, but Hikaru held on to me 
tightly. She would not let me go and I knew she would not leave me until 
I was safe. How did I know? I guess you could call it hunch...

			*			*			*

	I jumped off the side of the layer and I could feel Blanche go 
limp in my arms for without the layer, she was helpless. I couldn&#39;t 
leave her. I knew in my heart that I had to protect her. I could move 
without the layer. It was up to me and only me. I landed softly on the 
carpet. I knew that Blanche was sitting close to about...there. I 
quickly laid her down, making sure that she wasn&#39;t hurt by my swiftness. 
I could hear the slap of the slippers that Misaki and her guests all 
wore...they were getting too close for comfort. I glanced back at 
Blanche, who just glanced up at me from her limited view and I saw in 
her eyes her thanks. I folded her hands in her lap and then Blanche 
closed her eyes, now no more to other people a regular angel. The 
footsteps grew still closer and I jumped back to my position and sat 
down near Blanche. I let myself go limp and closed my eyes. The 
darkness...blackness...for so long, I was used to it. Now, it is a part 
of me just like the new world that was opened up to me. I thank 
Misaki-chan all the time for bringing me life. She was my creator and I 
thank her. I can hear now that Misaki and the others have returned. They 
bustle about us, but I cannot feel the gentle hands that are 
Misaki-chan&#39;s. Perhaps I expect her to pick me, perhaps have a battle in 
the layer, but no. A minute or two later I can hear the people move away 
from my position. Taking a risk I turned and peeked. Blanche was gone. I 
heaved a sigh in relief since I knew what that meant. Kaede-san must 
have picked her up and gone home. I wonder why Misaki hasn&#39;t done the 
same with me yet. I could hear her bustling about the place. What was 
wrong? I hope she didn&#39;t forget about me. I kicked myself mentally as 
that thought sunk in. She would never do that...not Misaki-chan.

	A few minutes later, although it felt like an eternity, especially 
in darkness, Misaki came and picked me up. She told me how she was sorry 
that she ignored me for that long duration and I had stop myself before 
I could tell her it wasn&#39;t her fault. I could feel her soft fingers as 
she held me gently and bore me off again. I knew where she was headed. 
She was headed to either her room or the bathroom, but most likely her 
room first, to get her clothes for bed. As she walked, she told me about 
how the party went well, which I was happy for. I had hoped the party 
went well for her. She then told me about the little game they played 
with the layer, although I remember vaguely playing it myself before. I 
could feel myself now descending and being gently laid down on something 
soft. It was probably Misaki-chan&#39;s bed or her pillow...

&quot;I&#39;ll be back after my shower,&quot; said Misaki cheerfully.

	I was happy...very happy in fact. My deus&#39; party went well and I 
learned to see a whole new world that was now open to me. Not only that, 
but I got to meet the white angel, Blanche. I waited until the water was 
running in the bathroom next door, to open my eyes and look around. It 
was a new environment, but I think I saw it once before when I first 
opened my eyes that time I became Misaki-chan&#39;s angel. I took a good 
look around this time. I let me see...Misaki&#39;s desk with her computer 
and more Angelic Layer things...I think. I flopped back on her bed and 
smiled warmly. Her bed felt so comfortable and...soft, I think the word 
is. I&#39;m so glad I can experience so much now and I was so lost in my own 
thoughts, that I didn&#39;t even hear Misaki come back until it was too 
late. I leapt to my feet as Misaki approached the position I had last 
been in. Lost as I was in my thoughts I had moved to the edge of her 
bed. I ran back across the soft sheets as Misaki froze in her tracks as 
she had spotted my movements. I paused, unsure of whether to keep moving 
or not. So instead, I smiled up at my creator...

&quot;Misaki.&quot;

	Her reaction was immediate...

&quot;Eeks! Hikaru...angel...talk...&quot;

	I hope I didn&#39;t shock the poor girl. I decide to approach her 
carefully. After all, she was my deus and I hoped she wouldn&#39;t hurt 
me...

&quot;Misakichi.&quot;

&quot;Eeks! Hikaru...moving...&quot;

	I guess I had more of an impact on her than I thought. I really 
hope I didn&#39;t scare her, but she wasn&#39;t running away. She was just 
standing there, spluttering in awe and amazement...I think. So, 
crouching down, I leapt up high toward Misaki&#39;s hand that was pointing 
at me. She reacted and caught me with her palm side up. She blinked as I 
continued to talk in what limited Japanese I knew...

&quot;Misaki...teach.&quot;

&quot;Teach?&quot;

	I think I just confused the poor girl even more now. Let me 
see...how could I convince Misaki on what to do...on what I wanted. 
After thinking for a bit, I decided to tell her...

&quot;Misaki...teach...talk.&quot;

	I hope I got the words out correctly. I could see her eyes had 
taken on a far away gaze as she just stared at the window behind 
me...almost if as if she didn&#39;t believe that this was happening. I hope 
she would come to her senses. I so desperately wanted to be able to 
learn how to talk. I got down on my knees and threw my last resort at 
her. I clasped my hands together, looked up at her and gave the kawaii 
puppy dog eyes that I&#39;ve seen some people use before. As I saw her 
glance back down at me, I could see her giving in. I hope it worked. My 
joy was indescribable as Misaki smiled down at me and nodded her head...

&quot;Hai...I will.&quot;

	She said yes. Oh, how wonderful! I could start being able to learn 
how to speak and communicate. Oh, wait a minute; I had to thank Misaki. 
I wracked my head trying to think of the right words...

&quot;Arigato.&quot;

	From the smile on her face, I knew that I had gotten the word 
right. Misaki set me back down on her bed and then turned to a little 
closet that looked about my size that was sitting on her nightstand. My 
curiosity was eased as she pulled out some pajamas that she had made for 
me. I smiled and took them. As Misaki turned away to put on her own 
pajamas, I peeked at her. I suddenly noticed that her pajamas were the 
same as mine. At least it showed that she cared for me by making them. I 
proceeded to take off my battle outfit. I let my body suit fall while 
taking off my gloves and boots and putting them aside. I unfolded the 
pajamas and slipped into them as I saw Misaki do a while ago. I hoped I 
did it right. As I finished, Misaki took my battle clothes and put them 
away in that small closet. I had just finished buttoning my pajama top 
when Misaki gently picked me up and set me down on her pillow. I guess 
it was for my safety because she slipped into her bed covers seconds 
after putting me down. It felt like an earthquake to me as she got under 
the covers, but I managed to keep my grip on the pillow. As Misaki drew 
the covers up, I settled down into the soft warm pillow and Misaki 
turned the light out. She covered as gently and as much as she knew I 
liked to be covered before speaking...

&quot;I&#39;ll promise to teach you everything I can.&quot;

&quot;Arigato.&quot;

			*			*			*

	It was hard learning to speak after all. It had been a few 
months...several weeks in fact; that I could now properly say some 
sentences and talk normally. It was thrilling in a way. I could talk and 
move. For some reason, I found out that I could dance as Misaki was 
playing a song this one time. My body just moved...it seemed almost 
natural. But I digress...I looked from the last lesson that Misaki was 
talking about and teaching. I nodded, understanding the syntax...

&quot;Well, that&#39;s about it,&quot; said Misaki, sitting back in her chair. &quot;I 
think if you learn some vocabulary every now and then, you&#39;ll get 
better.&quot;

&quot;Domo arigato.&quot;

	It was all I could say. I really didn&#39;t know how to repay Misaki 
for helping me out so much. The only thing I could think of was to help 
her out as much as I could in Angelic Layer...

&quot;No need to be so formal.&quot;

	Misaki&#39;s voice brought me back to my senses. I accidentally bowed 
instinctively since it was Japanese custom. I straightened up and nodded 
before speaking...

&quot;Now, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to ask a favor.&quot;

	I felt so guilty. Misaki devoted a lot of her time and attention 
to me and now I was asking for her help again. But Misaki just smiled 
down at me from her position...

&quot;Nan desu ka?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like you to...ano...&quot;

&quot;Like me to what?&quot;

&quot;Ano...I want to see Blanche.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...why her?&quot;

	I knew Misaki was going to ask that question. I couldn&#39;t face 
Misaki without answering. But if I answered, Misaki would probably think 
of me as strange. I scuffed the top of Misaki&#39;s desk with my boot. I was 
trying to think of an answer that I could use when I noticed Misaki&#39;s 
face was about face level with mine...

&quot;Hikaru...are you blushing?&quot;

&quot;Sonaka ja nai yo!&quot;

	I frantically waved my hands in front of me, trying to dispel 
whatever Misaki thought I was thinking of. It didn&#39;t work because she 
immediately launched into another question...

&quot;Uh-huh, so why do you want to go see Blanche?&quot;

&quot;Well, I sort of made friends with her at the party.&quot;

	This was mostly true since we spent the party in each other&#39;s 
company. I hoped Misaki bought that. I could see the hint of surprise in 
Misaki&#39;s eyes now...

&quot;How?&quot;

	I quickly explained how I found out I could move and that Blanche 
was lying right next to me. Not to mention the fact, I wanted to see if 
any other angels could do the same as I could...

&quot;You took her into the layer, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s great. It&#39;s great to make friends.&quot;

	I nodded happily. I guess Misaki bought my explanation. I sighed 
inwardly with relief. Glancing up I saw Misaki&#39;s face had grown somewhat 
serious...

&quot;What&#39;s on your mind?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I was thinking how I was going to explain this.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot;

&quot;About you being alive and all.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

	There was a silence. I was actually wondering myself how Misaki 
was going to explain it...or even how I was going to explain it. What 
scientists wanted to do studies on me? What if I would never see Misaki 
again? No...that was absurd. I was Misaki&#39;s angel and I knew if they 
were going to try and take me away, they were going to have to go 
through Misaki and her friends first...

&quot;Perhaps...&quot;

	I looked up. Was Misaki a mind reader? No...I could tell that she 
had something different on her mind. Don&#39;t ask me how, but I knew...

&quot;Hai?&quot;

	I concentrated for a bit and felt the familiar feeling of angel 
wings spouting out of my back. I flew over to Misaki, who had 
transferred over to the bed. I landed next to Misaki&#39;s head and withdrew 
my wings into me. I was curious to hear what Misaki had to say...

&quot;Perhaps it was when you earned your angel wings.&quot;

	Seeing the confused look on my face, Misaki explained. Going 
beyond what my original programming was set to? Was that possible? I had 
to think about it for a minute before Misaki interrupted my thoughts 
again...

&quot;Okay.&quot;

	Okay...okay what? What was Misaki talking about? I stayed silent 
and just watched as Misaki turned over on her stomach to look at me with 
a smile...

&quot;I&#39;ll take you to see Blanche.&quot;

&quot;Domo arigato.&quot;

	I clasped my hands and thanked heaven and my deus for being so 
kind...

&quot;Do itashimashite.&quot;

	Misaki then leaned over and grabbed the phone. I walked to the 
other side of the bed and toward the window. As Misaki talked, I sat 
down on the edge of the bed with one of my legs dangling over the edge. 
As the light breeze blew through the open window, I had to put my hair 
back to the way it was. I could see the sun outside and it was 
beautiful. Today was going to be just gorgeous...I just knew it would...

			*			*			*

	I slowly opened my eyes. Apparently Misaki kept her promise. I was 
in someone&#39;s room and it wasn&#39;t Misaki&#39;s. I concluded that it was 
Kaede-sama&#39;s room since Blanche lay propped up against a portable layer 
to my right. I looked up at the layer. It was on. Bless Misaki&#39;s kind 
heart...she turned it on me. Shaking Blanche a little bit on the 
shoulders, I roused her from her sleep...

&quot;Blanche...Blanche, ookiteru kudasai&quot;

			*			*			*

	I slowly awoke. Again I could not feel my body. I must be outside 
the layer again. Glancing up, I saw Hikaru&#39;s kind smile. I would have 
started, if I had been able to. When did Hikaru get here? Did Misaki 
bring her? I had no answers to the questions because Hikaru suddenly 
picked me and we were headed for the layer...

			*			*			*

	I jumped up and set Blanche down. That smile...that heavenly 
smile. Oh how I loved her so. But I couldn&#39;t tell her...not just yet. 
For her to understand me, I had to teach her what I knew and what 
Misaki-chan taught me. I took a deep breath and hoped Misaki taught me 
well...

&quot;Blanche, mitte...I can speak.&quot;

	I could see the excitement in Blanche&#39;s eyes for she clapped 
joyfully and smiled again. I started to instruct her on how to talk and 
to my surprise, she picked it up rather easily at which I was happy for. 
I began to teach her all I knew...and I hoped she would be able to use 
it...

		*			Time Passes...			*

	I don&#39;t know how long it had been, but the turning of the bedroom 
knob startled me out of the teaching mood. I swiftly turned my head and 
I could see that the knob was starting to turn. I had no time left. I 
had to act now before Blanche and I were discovered. I knew it might not 
be Misaki-chan since this was Kaede-sama&#39;s home. I quickly told Blanche 
the situation as I scooped her up in my arms. I jumped off the side of 
the layer and lay Blanche back down again in the same position she was 
in. I jumped to the side a bit, and sat down next to Blanche, closing my 
eyes. Not a moment too soon for the door opened all the way and I heard 
the slap at least three pairs of slippers on the floor. I hope we looked 
like normal angels because none of them were talking. I felt myself 
being lifted. I knew who it was. I could feel the soft and gentle hands 
of my deus Misaki-chan. I heard her bid farewell to her friends and 
start to go home. I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better day. It was time 
well spent...

			*			*			*

	Days pass and it was time for the Tag Team Tournament that Misaki 
had told me about. I did not mind since I was paired with Blanche, much 
to my excitement the first time I heard it. Now I was within a place 
that I knew well. The layer for the fighting tournaments and I reveled 
in it. I stood now in the layer with Blanche who wasn&#39;t looking nervous 
at all. I faced our opponents. Quinn and Shadow Panther they were 
called. I just hope I wasn&#39;t going to hurt them too badly...

&quot;Angelic Fight!&quot;

	The call was made. It was time to fight this tournament. I had to 
step to one side to narrowly avoid a whiplash from Quinn. I was 
surprised as Shadow Panther closed in quickly with a clothesline. I 
ducked and grabbed the extended arm of Shadow Panther and redirected the 
attack. I kicked her toward Blanche, who countered with a double drop 
kick to Shadow Panther&#39;s face. Shadow Panther had reeled back, but by 
then I had focused on Quinn, who now came rushing at me with both whips 
flying. I dodged but I knew I couldn&#39;t stay away forever...

			*			*			*

	As I jumped into the air, I flipped backwards to deliver a double 
drop missile kick to Shadow Panther. I landed on my hands and flipped 
back to my feet. I watched both my opponents. Quinn&#39;s two whips were 
holding off Hikaru from what I could see. I had to help her. Rushing 
forward, I activated my special ability: Hyper Mode. Running up to Quinn 
at twice the normal speed, I grabbed her and forced her away from my 
beloved Hikaru. I began to cut loose with punches and kicks so fast that 
all I could see was a blur from my hands and legs. Finally, I stopped 
and Quinn dropped to the ground, all her health points depleted. I 
sighed and deactivated Hyper Mode...

			*			*			*

	I blinked as I saw Blanche go into Hyper Mode and start wailing on 
Quinn, so I took the opportunity and turned on Shadow Panther. As she 
came at me, I ducked away and tripped her. This was the chance I had 
been waiting for. I grabbed one of Shadow Panther&#39;s feet and twisted it 
in the other direction. I could see her lurch in pain, for this was a 
submission move. I felt Misaki&#39;s guidance and I twisted a bit more. Out 
of the corner of my eye, I saw Quinn drop to the layer, defeated. I 
decided to take a moment and talk to my opponent...

&quot;Give up.&quot;

	For a minute, Shadow Panther resisted. Finally she tapped the 
ground in pain, telling me to let go...

&quot;Hikaru, Blanche...WIN!&quot;

	I heard the announcement that we had won. I dropped Shadow 
Panther&#39;s foot and walked over to Blanche. I knew she loved me, but then 
why was I so hesitant to say it myself? As we hugged gently, Misaki and 
Kaede made their way to us...

			*			*			*

	I must admit that we made a good team. Blanche and I defeated 
every tag team duel we&#39;ve come across. We even came up with a few new 
tag-team fighting tactics together. One of which involved, I used 
Blanche&#39;s Hyper Mode for a split second before flipping our opponent 
over toward Blanche. Blanche returned the favor by grabbing and kicking 
our opponent back toward me. In which case, I slammed my hands into the 
layer, creating a whirlwind of energy to rise up. I called it Raising 
Storm...at least I think that&#39;s what I think the other guy called it...

		*			The Final Round...			*

	Finally, it was the final round. It was Blanche and I against the 
Fujisaki sisters&#39; angels, Mao and Arisu. I had faced them both before 
and I could tell that they were not going to go down easy. They were the 
winners from the B-side of the arena as we were the winners from the A 
side. As the fight started, Arisu decided to start off with a flip kick 
toward me, which was a big mistake since I blocked and countered with a 
flip kick...

&quot;Ora!&quot;

	That kick knocked Arisu to the layer hard. I could tell that from 
the way Arisu was knocked into the layer with a crunch. I raised my 
right leg and tried to stomp Arisu, but she rolled out of the way...

			*			*			*

	As I watched Hikaru take Arisu, Mao charged at me quickly. I 
danced out of the way from a punch thrown by Mao. Using something that 
Hikaru taught me, I grabbed Mao&#39;s punching arm and flipped Mao to the 
ground. Mao rolled away and regrouped with Arisu. I was wary and stayed 
on guard...

			*			*			*

	I stayed on guard. From experience I knew that these two had a lot 
of stamina and could give as good as they got. I watched as they 
regrouped near Blanche. I tensed up since I knew they might attack her, 
so I wasn&#39;t completely taken by surprised as they launched a double 
flying kick at me. I blocked as much as I could, but my arms hurt as 
they sent me flying backward. I could see the edge of the layer getting 
closer and closer as I flew. No...I would not abandon Blanche! I dug my 
hands into the layer and managed to halt my fall...

&quot;Blanche...I won&#39;t abandon you!&quot;

			*			*			*

&quot;Hikaru...&quot;

	I was worried there, but I knew she wouldn&#39;t abandon me. She would 
never do such a thing. I could tell that she loved me as much as I loved 
her. I watched as she sped to my side. She looked me over...I think she 
was checking me for damage. She seemed satisfied that I had not been 
hurt. I saw Mao leap into the air. I quickly moved to counter her move 
while I saw Hikaru move to stop Arisu. I grabbed Mao&#39;s foot and swung 
her back down toward Hikaru...

			*			*			*

	I grabbed Arisu and sent her flying with a grab throw. Out of the 
corner of my eye, I saw Mao head straight for me. I leaned back and 
flipped quickly, throwing my foot out. I felt satisfaction when my 
Rolling Thunder attack connected. What I had not counted on was their 
final counter attack. I saw Mao streak past me down toward the layer, 
slamming a palm into the ground. As I fell back toward the layer, I 
suddenly felt the painful blows as Arisu kicked me many times...many 
painful times. I tried to block, but my left arm couldn&#39;t take much 
more. I could swear that it felt like Arisu was breaking it. What 
happened next was something I could not describe how painful it was to 
me. I could feel a heat wave wash over me. It burned, it seared and it 
scorched. I was vaguely aware of a hit to my back as my shoulder pads 
were burned off and my battle outfit was burned. I felt something I had 
never felt before. I felt at peace knowing that even if I was killed or 
destroyed, I felt at peace knowing that my Blanche was safe and 
unharmed. I was vaguely aware as I fell back down to the layer, landing 
hard, but I did not care. Nothing mattered to me any more except the 
well being of my beloved...

			*			*			*

	I covered my mouth with my hands, not believing what I saw. I 
tried to hold back my emotions, but I could not. They burst forth like 
water from a broken dam and I ran toward my fallen love...

&quot;Hikaru!&quot;

	I ran toward her and knelt down beside her. I held her carefully 
in my lap. She looked terrible. The upper parts of her clothes were 
literally burned off and her shoulder pads had gone missing. Her 
headpiece was only half of what it used to be and her left arms seemed 
broken. I could not contain the sorrow I felt and I could feel my tears 
running down my cheeks as I tried to call Hikaru back...tried to save 
her...

&quot;Hikaru, Hikaru!&quot;

	I could see the light fade from her eyes, but even as it did, 
Hikaru spoke to me for one final time...

&quot;Blanche...win...&quot;

	She protected me. She protected me so I could win the tournament. 
I knew that Hikaru was probably never going to talk to me again. In slow 
motion agony and what felt like years, Hikaru&#39;s head tilted back and her 
headpiece fell to the layer. The sound of her headpiece striking the 
layer made my heart stop. I felt my hands tremble...

&quot;Don&#39;t leave me Hikaru!&quot;

	I shook Hikaru, trying to rouse her. I could not believe she was 
gone. Gone from my life forever. Tears ran in torrents down my cheeks 
and cried into Hikaru&#39;s chest, holding her tightly...

&quot;Hikaru no aishiteru!&quot;

	What happened next was something unexpected to me. I cried to the 
heavens and I cried for the death of my love. My back felt strange and 
heart ached. For a single moment I found that I had grown my angel 
wings. I had also not realized that stadium had gone quiet. Laying 
Hikaru down gently next to the edge of the layer, I got to my feet and 
soared upwards into the sky of the layer. Turning around, I felt a 
single tear roll down my cheek as I turned back toward the layer. 
Activating my Hyper Mode, I felt the world blur as I streaked toward the 
layer. I slammed my fist into the layer, creating a shock wave. That 
attack carried all my power and my love. I could see the layer bend and 
Mao and Arisu were knocked out of the layer. I didn&#39;t want to hurt them, 
for I could tell they were shocked from Hikaru&#39;s death as much as I was. 
I saw out of the corner of my eye, that deus Hatoko had bore Hikaru off 
and started to check on her. My heart felt heavy as I stood up and flew 
out of the layer toward Kaede-sama. She had a saddened look on her face 
even as the winners were declared. I landed in Kaede-sama&#39;s outstretched 
hand...

&quot;You...you did well.&quot;

	I nodded, but suddenly my tears started to fall again from my 
eyes. For some reason I couldn&#39;t contain them no matter how much I 
wanted to stop crying...

&quot;She saved me. She saved me and I couldn&#39;t do anything...&quot;

&quot;You loved her very much, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

	I could only nod. I didn&#39;t feel much like fighting any more in 
Angelic Layer if this was the price I had to pay. Listening to Kaede 
talk with Hatoko, I found that Hikaru could be saved. I could not 
believe it and this time I wept with joy...

		*			A week later...			*

&quot;Hikaru...I&#39;m so glad that you came.&quot;

	I was happy now. More than I had ever been in my life. Hikaru was 
healed and was now back with me...

			*			*			*

&quot;I am too.&quot;

	I took Blanche&#39;s hand into mine. It was good to know that we had 
won the tournament and that she was still by my side...

&quot;So, you&#39;re okay now, right?&quot; 

	I nodded to answer Blanche&#39;s question. I looked out over into the 
sunset upon a cliff that we had sat under from our first date. I leaned 
back against the solitary tree that was growing there. Blanche explained 
what happened after I fell unconscious and my memory ceased at that 
point. It was hard to imagine, but I knew it was true. Blanche had grown 
her wings and the Angels Mao and Arisu were defeated. I looked down at 
Blanche as she snuggled up to me...

&quot;Blanche?&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Can I hear what you said to me after I died?&quot;

	I saw her nod as she leaned up closer to me. My cheeks felt hot 
and I could see her cheeks redden. As we drew closer, I could feel her 
sweet warm breath upon my lips as she spoke...

&quot;Hikaru...&quot;

&quot;Blanche...&quot;

&quot;Aishiteru...&quot;

			*			*			*

	We are the wind...the light...the heart and soul of Angelic Layer. 
When angels earn their wings, it is said that it is then when we go 
beyond what we originally were programmed to do. For when an angel earns 
her wings, we will be truly free...for we are the wind...the light...the 
heart and soul...and we WILL be free...
