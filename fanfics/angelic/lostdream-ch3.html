Escape from the Sea

&quot;Words cannot describe love. Love cannot be explained, it merely exists 
and is, and everyone understands it the moment they chance upon this 
world.&quot; unknown source

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

The child kneeled close to the figure lying on the ground, tears running 
down her cheeks, a tortured expression upon her lips. Rain fell in 
torrents, and the great crashing of waves could be heard in the 
distance.

&quot;Hatako-chan...&quot; Misaki whispered, but there was no reply. Her ghostly 
form was disconnected from the world, and yet, bound to it. Her heart 
throbbed greatly, seeing Hatako so miserable, seeing her lonely and 
distraught. &quot;No person should ever have to feel what you are feeling 
now, Hatako-chan.&quot;

Misaki looked down at her spirit self, only to find that her form was 
bare of any clothing and accessories. Her silver hair blew in a chaotic 
fashion, as if the wind had its own spirit form, but she could not feel 
it. Rain fell through her image, but she could feel its coldness. The 
thunder crashed around her, and the sound echoed in her ears. Hatako 
wept, and the tears felt like acid, burning through her heart.

Glancing back to her body, Misaki noticed it floating into the sea, only 
to disappear soon after. She floated down to the water, only to find 
that moments later, Hatako was running toward the beach. Misaki screamed 
with all her might, but Hatako did not stop. The waves knocked her down, 
but she did not stop, and Misaki raced after her, plunging what remained 
of her into the seawater.

It was then that Misaki saw it... a softly glowing light coming from 
Hatako&#39;s heart. It pulsed with the waves, growing stronger with each 
cycle. She looked at herself, only to find the same effect. They were 
all in unison. Misaki found herself thinking of Hatako, that child she 
had met not to long ago. She found herself thinking of the love they 
shared, and what it had driven them to at this point in time. Hatako was 
trying to kill herself for her, and Misaki soon realized that their love 
was more powerful then life itself; Hatako was not dying.

&quot;Misaki?&quot; called the child. It was then that girl realized she was not 
drowning. &quot;Why haven&#39;t I drowned?&quot;

Did Hatako know she was there, thinking about her? Misaki watched as 
Hatako picked up a shell from the sand, and cut herself with it.

&quot;Hatako-chan is so smart,&quot; mused Misaki, &quot;when she&#39;s sane.&quot; She moved 
closer to Hatako, wanting to touch her, but each time she cast her arm 
through Hatako, she felt nothing.

Hatako dropped the shell and placed her hand over her heart, &quot;My heart 
is still alive.&quot; Hatako paused slightly, &quot;No, both of them are alive. 
And Misaki&#39;s, she has lost one, but the other...&quot;

Misaki mused once more, this time to herself that she would float around 
Hatako&#39;s heart for all eternity. As soon as she had finished that 
thought, however, Hatako called out to her.

&quot;Misaki!&quot; cried Hatako, and a jolt of pain ran through Misaki as she 
gazed at the lonely child. What would Hatako do, now that she was gone? 
Misaki already knew the answer, and it was no more fair then her own 
murder. She had to do something.

&quot;I will be with you forever, Hatako-chan,&quot; whispered Misaki, floating 
gently to Hatako&#39;s heart, only to find that she could feel it. It was 
quite obvious Hatako felt it, and Misaki soon found Hatako asleep under 
the waves.

&quot;I still miss holding you, Hatako-chan, but I am happy you are with me,&quot; 
thought Misaki. &quot;I would not leave you, even after death.&quot;

Quite abruptly, the vision ended, and Hatako came back to her present 
surroundings. She was still hidden in the seaweed, and Misaki&#39;s presence 
still warmed her. She found small tears forming in her eyes, and they 
drifted off into the water.

&quot;Misaki-chan... Why? Why us?&quot; Hatako cried softly, as memories of last 
night flooded her thoughts. &quot;We... we haven&#39;t done anything wrong.&quot;

Misaki concentrated her feelings so Hatako could receive a message.

&quot;That... be why...&quot; came Misaki&#39;s thoughts a short while later.

&quot;Are you saying we are being punished for being good to each other?&quot; 
Hatako asked quickly.

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Then what?&quot; Hatako&#39;s eyes were glimmering under the water, and Misaki 
felt sorry for her.

&quot;Test,&quot; came the sound of the ocean, &quot;Love... Test...&quot;

&quot;What makes you think it is a test? Misaki-chan, you were murdered...&quot;

&quot;Breathe... Water... Dreams...&quot;

Hatako didn&#39;t respond for several minutes, and she finally began to 
piece together the information. Misaki stroked Hatako&#39;s black hair, but 
could not feel it. However, just by chance, her hand ran into the ribbon 
binding it. She soon found that it actually could be felt in its 
entirety.

&quot;Feel... Ribbon...&quot; Hatako felt behind her, only to find that the ribbon 
Misaki had tied into her hair was missing. She looked desperately around 
for it, only to find it right in front of eyes in the shape of a heart.

&quot;The ribbon, you can touch it?&quot; Hatako questioned, now interested in 
what Misaki had found. Misaki, after a moment of thought, wrapped it 
around her right hand like a glove. Hatako reached forward slowly, and 
the ribbon moved forward, only to meet and hold each other.

&quot;That is Misaki-chan&#39;s hand...&quot; whispered Hatako, a great smile forming 
on her face for the first time since the incident. Misaki released her 
grip shortly after though, to Hatako&#39;s dismay.

&quot;Misaki-chan...&quot; Hatako began, but she watched in curiosity as the 
ribbon unwound and was pulled straight. Moments later, it rushed at her. 
It reached her lips, and Hatako soon felt Misaki&#39;s on the other side. 
Hatako shed new tears, of joy and of longing. Misaki cried too, and she 
lifted the ribbon to wipe away Hatako&#39;s tears from her eyelashes, 
freeing them into the ocean.

&quot;This ribbon must be special,&quot; Hatako said softly, &quot;It is a link between 
you and this world. Perhaps the only link.&quot;

Voices could be heard above the water now, and the sound of watercraft 
could be heard rumbling in the distance. They were looking for Hatako.

&quot;Misaki-chan, they are coming for me! Come with me to the surface, 
quickly!&quot; Hatako requested desperately. Misaki conjured another vision 
to appear in Hatako&#39;s thoughts. It was short, but Hatako quickly learned 
something as she watched Misaki trying to float away from the waves. 
They kept pulling her back into the water. The vision ended, and 
Hatako&#39;s eyes gazed out into the ocean, emotionless.

&quot;You cannot come with me then...&quot; Hatako cried softly. Misaki wiped away 
the tears once more with the ribbon.

Hatako&#39;s eyes opened wide. A thought had just chanced upon her 
imagination.

&quot;Misaki, float inside of me and tie it around your chest, quickly! When 
I leave, the ribbon will anchor you to my body. If the sea is not 
persistent, you will be with me instead, as long as we are bound.&quot; 
Hatako instructed, and Misaki complied in a heartbeat. Hatako was so 
smart, when she was sane of course.

The ribbon was wrapped somewhat tightly around Hatako&#39;s chest, and 
Misaki drew a bow between her nipples.

&quot;Close...&quot; whispered the sea.

&quot;I think I will enjoy it,&quot; replied Hatako, blushing as she thought about 
it. She untied her bathing suit from the seaweed, and slipped it over 
the ribbon, hiding it completely. The ribbon, while broad and long, was 
thin enough to be almost invisible under the one-piece.

&quot;Love... You...&quot;

Hatako continued to blush, even as she swam to the surface of the water. 
Once her head popped above the swells, she breathed in the air several 
times to remove the water from her lungs. Having people &#39;rescue&#39; her 
while she was breathing underwater seemed like a bad idea. Once she 
found herself buoyant again, she began to swim with the swells back to 
shore.

&quot;Hope... with you...&quot; called Misaki, and Hatako heard her, and even 
though they were not underwater, it sounded as such.

&quot;Me too, Misaki-chan... With all my heart, me too.&quot; Hatako replied. 
Several people on the shore saw her coming, and they called out to her. 
She ignored them, however. Upon reaching the dry sand, she just smiled 
sweetly and moved on, even as they crowded around her, asking if she was 
okay. She made her way to the cottage, and closed the door behind her. 
Hatako turned around after flipping the lock, only to be greeted by 
Misaki&#39;s mother. A sad look was on her face, but it was strong, and 
Hatako knew what she was thinking.

&quot;Something has happened to Misaki, hasn&#39;t it?&quot; Shuuko asked quietly. 
Hatako nodded. &quot;I had a dream, it was a dark dream.&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean, Shuuko-san...&quot; Hatako replied in the same manner.

&quot;There is someone that can help you. They live in the sea off the coast 
of Gibraltar. Their name is Resona Yano. The dream told me this.&quot; Shuuko 
continued, and Hatako listened intently. Shuuko cringed, but maintained 
herself, &quot;You must go, with Misaki. I cannot help you further.&quot; A few 
tears rolled down her cheeks.

&quot;Excuse me, Hatako-chan, I must have some time to myself,&quot; and with 
that, Shuuko stood, unlocked the door, and left, closing it softly 
behind her.

Hatako could feel sadness in Misaki&#39;s heart, and she looked down at the 
floor.

&quot;She knew as well,&quot; Hatako murmured. Misaki didn&#39;t reply for awhile.

&quot;Look... High. Hope... Happiness... Remember... Be this...&quot; Misaki 
whispered. Hatako knew she was right, being sad about it wasn&#39;t going to 
do anything now. They were going to find out a way to bring Misaki back, 
and hindrances were uncalled for.

&quot;Misaki-chan, take a bath with me.&quot; Hatako said, moving towards the tub, 
&quot;This seaweed is annoying.&quot;

&quot;Ribbon... Idea... Love...&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t leave you behind, Misaki-chan. Never could have... Ever...&quot; 
Hatako replied as she turned on the hot water. She relocked the door and 
made sure the curtains were drawn before carefully removing her bathing 
suit. She could feel Misaki tugging gently on the ends of the bow, 
making sure it was still snug. Misaki then placed her hand on the 
ribbon, applying a soft pressure. The warmth within Hatako reached 
through the ribbon, and Misaki could feel it washing over her hand like 
sunshine.

The bath filled soon, and Hatako sunk in, letting the water cover her 
entire body, letting it enter her lungs. Her hair drifted freely in the 
clear water above her head, and Hatako helped the seaweed free, dropping 
the larger pieces on the floor next to the tub.

Misaki longed to lift the seaweed from Hatako&#39;s hair, to cleanse her 
body with a soft sponge, to hold her... She closed her eyes and wished 
for things to be simpler, for things to be right, for freedom. Misaki 
knew a mere wish wouldn&#39;t grant those things to her now, but she still 
wished, and dreamed. In the past, she had taken the ability to embrace 
Hatako for granted. But now, it was different, and she promised herself 
she would never take things such as these again. The longing passion of 
withheld love had lit her soul once more, and now it consumed her.

&quot;Love... you... Hold... you...&quot; Misaki whispered. Hatako stopped 
fidgeting with her hair.

&quot;Me too Misaki, me too.&quot; Hatako proceed to clean her hair again after a 
few moments, but couldn&#39;t finish. A new wave of warmth raced through her 
body, and she found herself drifting off to dreams.

...

&quot;You mine Misaki-chan... All mine...&quot; whispered Hatoko while squinting 
her eyes trying to be evil looking. Misaki stared at her for a moment.

&quot;You goofball... Hatoko-chan... You mine... All mine...&quot; whispered back 
Misaki. Hatoko slowly let her arms fall from beneath her and she soon 
rested atop Misaki once again as their legs hung over the side of the 
bed.

&quot;Now Misaki-chan... What do you want to do today? You the guest! I am at 
your service my master...&quot; said Hatoko and she hopped of the bed and 
bowed. Misaki smiled her own evil smile this time.

&quot;Hmm... maybe I will play witch and boil you in big iron pot...&quot; 
suggested Misaki.

&quot;For dinner?&quot; asked Hatoko, playing along.

&quot;Yes. I&#39;ll eat you for dinner.&quot; replied Misaki. She showed her teeth to 
Hatoko in a big evil grin.

&quot;Oooo... can I be a bunny rabbit please?&quot; said Hatoko. She bent down on 
the ground and hopped around on all fours.

&quot;Yes... but first, you must be caught cause you&#39;re a wild bunny 
rabbit...&quot; replied Misaki. Hatoko responded by moving away from Misaki 
by hopping.

&quot;Trying to get away so soon? I&#39;ll get you my furry dinner... I&#39;ll get 
you...&quot; cackled Misaki as though she were a witch. She got off of the 
bed and put up her arms like she was trying to scare away a bear.

Misaki followed Hatoko. When she was near, Hatoko would dart to the 
other side of the room. Eventually Hatoko wore out however, and Misaki 
came at her.

&quot;Finally... oh pretty bunny, you mine!&quot; and with that Misaki jumped on 
Hatako&#39;s back. She wrapped her arms around Hatako&#39;s abdomen and rolled 
onto the floor to avoid hurting Hatoko from being on top of her. Hatoko 
was now on top of Misaki instead. She squirmed around while Misaki held 
tightly onto her prey. Hatoko ran out of energy and lay on Misaki&#39;s 
chest while they rested.

Misaki didn&#39;t want to move. Hatoko was on top of her. She felt warmth 
from Hatoko, but it was more then that. It was love. Misaki closed her 
eyes. She was tingling all over...

...

Hatako&#39;s dream was a memory from long ago, and while Hatako slept 
peacefully under the water, Misaki wept ghostly tears as she read the 
child&#39;s dreams.

&quot;Look at what fate has stolen from us, Hatako. Look at what it has 
taken...&quot; Misaki mumbled softly.
