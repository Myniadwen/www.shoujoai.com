Misaki and Hatoko slept better then usual that night, both secured in 
the hearts that finally there was someone for them. The rain that had 
started during evening time continued into the morning, blocking the sun 
with large dark grey clouds that poured water down upon the house of 
Hatoko&#39;s family.

Misaki woke up to find herself in a strange room. Then she remembered 
that she was at Hatoko&#39;s house. Hatoko. She jumped out of bed fully 
dressed and started for the door, in which Hatoko opened at the same 
time. She stepped in and closed the door behind her.

&quot;Hatoko-chan!&quot; exclaimed Misaki in her cute high voice. Hatoko smiled 
and ran up to her. She embraced Misaki in a hug.

&quot;Misaki-chan, breakfast is almost ready, so prepare to go in undercover 
mode.&quot; replied Hatoko in a soft, happy voice. Misaki smiled and 
acknowledged Hatoko.

Hatoko let go of Misaki and grabbed her hand. She put on a little kid 
attitude and pulled Misaki along to the dining room/kitchen for 
breakfast. Today was a work day for Hatoko&#39;s parents so they weren&#39;t 
around to eat breakfast with them, but Kotarou and Tamayo were there 
scarfing down breakfast. Side by side mind you.

Misaki and Hatoko sat down on the other side of the table and placed 
food on their plates from the covered pots on the table. It wasn&#39;t to 
fancy... more like fend for yourself or go hungry, but Misaki couldn&#39;t 
complain; the food was excellent.

&quot;Misakachi, your Aunt called, they&#39;ll be out another day.&quot; informed 
Tamayo as she swallowed a mouth full of food.

&quot;Ya, they figured you might want to spend the day with us because at 
home you wouldn&#39;t have anything to do,&quot; continued Kotarou. He drained 
his glass of orange juice.

&quot;Oh, ok. Thanks.&quot; replied Misaki. She began to eat her breakfast, and 
found that Hatoko was nearly squirming in her seat with excitement. The 
only reason why Kotarou and Tamayo didn&#39;t notice was because they were 
looking deep into each&#39;s eyes once again. Misaki and Hatoko noticed and 
silently giggled as they finished their breakfast. When they were 
finished Misaki removed the salmon from the fridge.

&quot;Hatoko-chan, will you please get me the ingrediants for my salmon 
sandwiches?&quot; asked Misaki. Hatoko set her plate in the sink and gathered 
the items that Misaki whould use to make the sandwiches as Kotarou and 
Tamayo looked over to Misaki with eyes wide open and noses sniffing.

&quot;Salmon sandwiches!?!?!&quot; exclaimed Tamayo.

&quot;I know it&#39;s not polite to make a guest work, but Suzuhara wants to... 
and the sandwiches are the greatest... I can&#39;t stop her...&quot; grinned 
Kotarou.

Ten minutes later the sandwiches were finished and Misaki put them into 
the fridge for later.

Hatoko cleaned up quickly and grabbed Misaki&#39;s hand yet again. She 
dragged Misaki out of the kitchen. Right before she left she stuck out 
her tongue at Kotarou and Tamayo as they watched the parade of the 
Dueses.

Misaki realized what was going on and after Hatoko closed the kitchen 
door they raced hand in hand to Misaki&#39;s guest room, shutting her door 
behind them as well.

&quot;You should put on clean clothes Misaki-chan, those are the ones from 
last night,&quot; grinned Hatoko. She went to get the clothes that Misaki had 
laid out the night before on her desk and handed them to Misaki.

Misaki looked down at her shirt. She saw the nearly invisible stains 
from her tears. she nearly ripped her shirt off, wanting to shed herself 
of the memories of last night of crying. Hatoko realized why Misaki was 
so quick to remove her shirt and smiled.

&quot;Poor Misaki-chan, she had to go through that,&quot; thought Hatoko, 
&quot;although now, she won&#39;t ever have to go through that again...&quot;

Misaki finished changing and she placed the dirty clothes into a cloth 
bag in her little suit case on wheels.

&quot;Well its raining today isn&#39;t it... there goes the park idea.&quot; said 
Misaki. She sat down on her bed.

&quot;And the Piffle Princess is closed for remodeling to... it&#39;s going to 
take me years to catch up!&quot; added Hatoko.

&quot;Guess we&#39;re stuck here then...&quot; continued Misaki.

&quot;Yup...&quot; replied Hatoko. They both grinned big grins and giggled a bit 
before a knock was heard on the door. They looked towards the door as it 
opened to reveal Kotarou and Tamayo standing there. A few minutes 
passed.

&quot;Well come in...&quot; said Misaki. They entered reluctantly, expecting 
Hatoko to do something wierd, at least in their eyes since Misaki 
already knew that Hatoko was a goofball at heart, even when helping a 
friend. Kotarou never realized it because he never needed his sister&#39;s 
help.

&quot;Umm... we were just gonna stay here today because it&#39;s raining...&quot; said 
Tamayo. She was hold Kotarou&#39;s hand.

&quot;I suppose you want to spend it with Kotarou-kun then?&quot; probed Misaki.

&quot;Ya. I mean, umm...&quot; Tamayo and Kotarou grew red in the face and looked 
at the ground. Misaki and Hatoko giggled.

&quot;Fine then. I&#39;ll spend the day with Misaki-chan. Now shoo and do that 
wierd stuff else where!&quot; and with that Hatoko pushed them outside and 
closed the door. She could hear them whispering outside. They said 
something funny, and Hatoko laughed loudly.

&quot;Ahh! Hatoko-chan heard!&quot; exclaimed Kotarou. He and Tamayo ran off. 
Misaki didn&#39;t know what happened, and she had no time to think about it 
as Hatoko jumped onto her and pressed her against the bed.

&quot;You mine Misaki-chan... All mine...&quot; whispered Hatoko while squinting 
her eyes trying to be evil looking. Misaki stared at her for a moment.

&quot;You goofball... Hatoko-chan... You mine... All mine...&quot; whispered back 
Misaki. Hatoko slowly let her arms fall from beneath her and she soon 
rested atop Misaki once again as their legs hung over the side of the 
bed.

&quot;Now Misaki-chan... What do you want to do today? You the guest! I am at 
your service my master...&quot; said Hatoko and she hopped of the bed and 
bowed. Misaki smiled her own evil smile this time.

&quot;Hmm... maybe I will play witch and boil you in big iron pot...&quot; 
suggested Misaki.

&quot;For dinner?&quot; asked Hatoko, playing along.

&quot;Yes. I&#39;ll eat you for dinner.&quot; replied Misaki. She showed her teeth to 
Hatoko in a big evil grin.

&quot;Oooo... can I be a bunny rabbit please?&quot; said Hatoko. She bent down on 
the ground and hopped around on all fours.

&quot;Yes... but first, you must be caught cause your a wild bunny rabbit...&quot; 
replied Misaki. Hatoko responded by moving away from Misaki by hopping.

&quot;Trying to get away so soon? I&#39;ll get you my furry dinner... I&#39;ll get 
you...&quot; cackled Misaki as though she were a witch. She got off of the 
bed and put up her arms like she was trying to scare away a bear.

Misaki followed Hatoko. When she was near Hatoko would dart to the other 
side of the room. Eventually Hatoko wore out though. Misaki came at her.

&quot;Finally... oh pretty bunny, you mine!&quot; and with that Misaki jumped on 
Hatoko&#39;s back. She wrapped her arms around Hatoko&#39;s abdomen and rolled 
onto the floor to avoid hurting Hatoko from being on top of her. Hatoko 
was now on top of Misaki instead. She squirmed around while Misaki held 
tightly onto her prey. Hatoko ran out of energy and lay on Misaki&#39;s 
chest while they rested.

Misaki didn&#39;t want to move. Hatoko was on top of her. She felt warmth 
from Hatoko, but it was more then that. It was love. Misaki closed her 
eyes. She was tingling all over.

Hatoko felt nearly the same, except she wanted to face Misaki. She 
turned herself around soon after Misaki closed her eyes and lost 
interest in restraining Hatoko as if she were dinner. Hatoko starred at 
Misaki&#39;s cute face and hair.

&quot;You know what Hatoko-chan?&quot; asked Misaki with her eyes still closed.

&quot;What is it o great Princess Misaki-chan?&quot; replied Hatoko. Misaki opened 
her eyes.

&quot;Not to disappoint you, but this floor is hard and it&#39;s hurting me...&quot; 
answered Misaki. Hatoko jumped off of Misaki and quickly and helped her 
up.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry Misaki-chan... You were comfy...&quot; giggled Hatoko. Misaki 
just smiled at Hatoko&#39;s silly choice of words.

The rain continued to pour outside as Misaki and Hatoko played around in 
the room like little bunny rabbits, hidden from the sight of anybody 
that might tear them apart, anybody that might keep them apart, simply 
because they were both girls. Girls that loved each other.

Lunch time came, and Misaki and Hatoko left the room to go to the dining 
room/kitchen to eat Misaki&#39;s Famous Salmon Sandwiches that they had 
prepared earlier. When they got there they found the Kotarou and Tamayo 
were not around.

&quot;We&#39;ll just eat ours together I guess... those love-birds can eat 
their&#39;s later. They must be involved in something so important that 
they&#39;ve lost their appetite for your sandwiches,&quot; decided Misaki. Hatoko 
agreed and they took out a couple sandwiches for themselves. Hatoko took 
the first bite.

&quot;Better then last time Misaki-chan!&quot; said Hatoko.

&quot;Oo... they aren&#39;t that good... really now...&quot; replied Misaki slightly 
flattered as she eyed her sandwich in her hands.

&quot;They are to! Now eat up...&quot; ordered Hatoko.

&quot;I thought I was the guest here,&quot; joked Misaki.

&quot;You are, but I get to make you eat because your neglecting to eat. Eat 
or I&#39;ll have to punish you...&quot; threatened Hatoko.

&quot;Fine, but only because I *whispering* love you&quot; surrendered Misaki. She 
took a bite as Hatoko recovered from the un-anticipated use of words. 
They were both blushing and eating salmon sandwiches when Kotarou and 
Tamayo showed up.

&quot;Hey look Tamayo-chan, the salmon is turning their faces red,&quot; pointed 
out Kotarou. Tamayo just smiled as she ate a sandwich. Kotarou took a 
sandwich as well. They both munched away. Misaki and Hatoko just looked 
at them.

&quot;Your both turning red too! More specificly... your both blushing!&quot; said 
Hatoko to Tamayo and Kotarou. They both dropped their heads again as 
they ate.

&quot;We uh...&quot; started Tamayo.

&quot;Keep your lovey-dovey stuff to yourself please so that we don&#39;t choke 
on our food. Although if choking is the game, we could make you choke to 
death if you please.&quot; interjected Hatoko. She and Misaki both laughed at 
the private choke as the other two just stared in wierd wonder.

&quot;This is going to be fun Hatoko-chan,&quot; said Misaki, grinning. Hatoko 
agreed.

&quot;This will be fun... the bunnies that shall hide hand in hand... this 
shall be fun...&quot; finished Hatoko. Kotarou and Tamayo didn&#39;t know what to 
say. They had no clue what Misaki and Hatoko were talking about. They 
failed like Misaki earlier to even grasp a different conception of love. 
Misaki and Hatoko giggled.

&quot;Baka,&quot; Misaki and Hatoko said together. (baka means idiot or idiots)</pre>
