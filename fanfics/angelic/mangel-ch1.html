<h1>My Angel</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../angelic/index.html">Angelic Layer</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kamui.html">Kamui Ikari</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Since I was a little one, I&#39;d fought many battles for my life, for my
passion for the &quot;Angelic Layer&quot;, but I didn&#39;t expect to fight for the
love of the one I loved.

I love that person with all my heart.

With my angel, we were invincible and won every battle that we had,
until she came. She was a beginner in this game, she got her angel from
the hands of that man, the professor. Icchan, I believe.

She made her angel an important part of her life, and like me, she
wanted to win, supported by my brother and her friend.

I remember the day when we met for the first time.

She was walking happily with her angel. I was surprised to see one with
it; when I saw it, the angel was... &quot;naked&quot;.

Maybe I&#39;m rude with that word but the angel didn&#39;t have a costume or
cloth.

I made her a dress for her angel. She thanked me. I asked for her name
and her angel&#39;s name.

She told me both names and when I was going to say mine, my brother
said it, screaming.

I introduced both of us to her and then I went to my classroom in the
Eriol Gakuen.

Later I heard, a few days later, that she got a cloth for the angel,
that she won her first battle, and entered in the circuit by receiving
a card.

I was expecting to face her in a battle, to test our skills, and I was
expecting to find a good rival.

I found one and more...

I won the battle and I made her a promise to have a fight again and I
left the place.

She endured through the battles that she had and finally the day has
come.

In that day I lost for the first time.

I was happy, to find someone who could defeat me and my angel, she was
entirely happy, and her friend and my brother came to support her
triumph.

I left the place with a smile.

However, we had many battles. Sometimes I won, sometimes I lost, but I
was happy.

She, like me, wanted to win the Angelic Layer Championship. We had
become good friends and rivals, and won that title; she first, me
later.

Through the years, I had grown up and I fell in love with her. I don&#39;t
know why, but she was in my heart.

I thought that she was in love with my brother, she was. I was jealous
of him but I knew that my love was impossible, because I&#39;m a girl and
she is older than me.

I tried to say my love through the battles that we have, but she didn&#39;t
understand. She is naive.

I sat in the park and I was looking at the sky and read my homework. I
lost track of time and it was night.

&quot;Hatoko-chan...&quot;

I was surprised to see her, she was beautiful, and was smiling. I tried
not to blush and she sat next to me.

&quot;Where&#39;s Hikaru?&quot; I asked because she was usually with her angel all
the time.

&quot;In the house, but I&#39;m not here to talk about her,&quot; she said.

&quot;No?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m here to talk about you,&quot; she said.

I was thrown off-guard.

&quot;Me?&quot; I asked.

She said nothing and laid a hand on my cheek, I blushed and my heart
was beating faster, like a dream.

&quot;Finally I understand what you&#39;d tried to say to me in these battles.
Finally,&quot; she said with a sweetness in her eyes.

My heart stopped.

She stood up as I did, and she moved her head close to mine, and I feel
that I&#39;m going to drown.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind my age or Hikaru, because I found my angel. You. I love
you, Hatoko-chan, with all my heart,&quot; she said and before I could
respond she kissed me softly.

My arms went around her and I kissed her strongly.

&quot;You are my angel, too. Misaki-san,&quot; I said with a smile.

She hugged me and I rested my head on her chest. I&#39;m so happy because
an angel fell to bring me happiness.

Author&#39;s notes:

1. I only have the first vol. of the manga, so I have a basic idea of
it.

2. I would like to see Hatoko and Misaki together, and Hatoko reminds
me of Tomoyo-chan, my favorite character of CCS.

3. In this story Hatoko is 15 years old and Misaki is 23 years old.

Well, that&#39;s all for now.

If you liked it or don&#39;t please e-mail me.
