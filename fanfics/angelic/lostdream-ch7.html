Chasing Legends

&quot;Seek the impossible, and it becomes possible.&quot; excerpt, Teachings of 
Yun

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Misaki-chan sat on the side of the desk, kicking at the air with her 
legs. Hatoko was changing into her nightclothes just a meter away. They 
were at Shuuko&#39;s house in Misaki&#39;s bedroom.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you glad you can move around a bit easier now, Misaki-chan?&quot; 
Hatoko asked as she slipped her nightgown over her head. Misaki-chan 
nodded.

&quot;But you must still be careful about being seen in public. Most people 
aren&#39;t used to seeing angels that walk when they are not on a layer.&quot; 
Misaki-chan nodded her head again.

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Hatoko began as she looked at Misaki-chan. &quot;We haven&#39;t seen you 
fly yet. Maybe... try tonight?&quot;

&quot;Fly!...&quot; Misaki replied, and the angel stood up. Hatoko threw her dirty 
clothes into the laundry basket and turned back to see Misaki-chan.

The angel closed her eyes, and a flash of light filled the room. When it 
had disappeared, a set of wings had sprouted upon Misaki-chan&#39;s back.

&quot;Beautiful... Misaki-chan... Who would have thought?&quot; Hatoko said 
softly, gazing at the angel in front of her. &quot;I suppose it&#39;s not very 
hard for you to do either, like Icchan-san said.&quot;

Misaki-chan nodded, flapping her wings. Her body lifted from the desktop 
slowly, a little with each stroke. And then, after reaching some height, 
the angel glided in gentle circles around Hatoko.

&quot;Fly!...&quot; Misaki repeated, excitement in her voice. The angel landed 
softly on Hatoko&#39;s shoulder, and reached to place her hand on Hatoko&#39;s 
cheek. &quot;Still... Miss... Warmth...&quot;

&quot;It still is to bad it had to be this way, Misaki-chan, but I get the 
feeling we are learning about something wonderful at the same time.&quot; 
Hatoko replied, and Misaki-chan nodded, only to notice a hand mirror on 
the ground. The angel glided to the ground, and peered at herself in the 
mirror. Misaki-chan ran her hand through her sea blue hair. She stood 
still for several more minutes, only to run her hand through it again.

&quot;Hatoko-chan... Memories... Come to me...&quot; Misaki started, and Hatoko 
looked at her thoughtfully.

&quot;Are you saying, that perhaps long ago... Your appearance was similar to 
the angel&#39;s now, not counting size?&quot; Hatoko asked carefully. Misaki-chan 
turned to her, nodding. &quot;Really...&quot; Hatoko wondered out loud.

As the night progressed, Hatoko grew tired, and Shuuko came in at 
precisely the right time to put her to bed. Shuuko soon noticed the 
angel flying above her head.

&quot;Misaki... The flying Deus.&quot; Shuuko commented as Misaki glided to a stop 
on her opened palm. &quot;You handle the angel like you would Hikaru.&quot;

Misaki-chan nodded.

&quot;Misaki still can&#39;t wait to be normal again, but she is happy that we 
are helping her. She is happy we are here for her.&quot; Hatoko stated, and 
Misaki-chan nodded again.

&quot;I am glad she has you Hatoko, I know that you can make things right, 
even without anyone&#39;s help. You have great willpower, you know.&quot; Shuuko 
commended. &quot;Anyways, we will talk more tomorrow, it is time for bed.&quot;

Shuuko helped Hatoko into the covers and said goodnight. Misaki-chan 
flew over to the light switch, and once the door had been closed behind 
Shuuko, switched it off. In the dim light, a soft glow could be seen 
coming from Hatoko&#39;s chest, and from Misaki-chan as well. The angel 
glided back to Hatoko&#39;s head, and folding up her wings, snuggled up to 
Hatoko. Hatoko clutched Misaki-chan gently in her hands, bringing her 
close to her heart.

&quot;Don&#39;t... squish me...&quot; Misaki whispered.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Hatoko yawned, Shuuko had made her get up early so they could go to the 
stadium at the same time. She munched away breakfast at half speed. 
Misaki-chan was carefully removing clean silverware from the dishwasher 
and placing it in the drawer it belonged in, one piece at a time.

&quot;Hatoko, we only have a few days before you go. We need to gather as 
much information as possible today.&quot; Shuuko said, Hatoko nodded.

&quot;I want to be prepared, for Misaki&#39;s sake.&quot;

&quot;And for yourself, Hatoko. Remember what you have discovered about your 
relationship. You cannot allow for there to be an error. You&#39;re just as 
important to me as Misaki. This past year... It has brought back 
memories of my first love, who was in fact a girl about Misaki&#39;s age.&quot; 
Shuuko added, and Hatoko listened intently.

&quot;Her name was Sayoko-chan... We had so many good times together, until I 
met her sister...&quot; Shuuko detailed. Misaki-chan flew over and landed 
softly on the table. &quot;Her sister was very jealous it turned out, and she 
managed to ruin the relationship. I never found myself chasing after 
girls again.&quot;

&quot;That is to bad,&quot; Hatoko replied quietly, watching Misaki-chan watch 
her. &quot;It really is.&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; Shuuko shrugged, &quot;All I can do now is remember the good 
times.&quot; Hatoko nodded. &quot;I think it&#39;s time to get going, Icchan will be 
waiting by now.&quot;

After quickly clearing the table, Shuuko and Hatoko left the house, with 
Misaki-chan flying closely behind, gliding to a stop in the car. Shortly 
later, they were entering the elevator.

&quot;Misaki-chan, it might be wise to act like a doll.&quot; Hatoko started.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Hatoko-chan... Icchan has the entire level working on 
finding some clue as to why you must head halfway across the world. 
There are many smart people here, you know.&quot; Shuuko replied, and Hatoko 
smiled. Misaki-chan smiled as well, showing her gratitude.

&quot;We&#39;ll solve this mystery in no time at all.&quot; Hatoko said to 
Misaki-chan, and the angel nodded. The door of the elevator opened, and 
Misaki-chan glided down the hall upon seeing Icchan, landing on his 
head.

&quot;I see you have managed to open your wings, Misaki-chan. Quite 
impressive, the entire thing, really.&quot; Icchan said upon noticing the 
flying angel. Yuuko was impressed with the whole display, this being the 
first time she had seen the miracle Misaki doll.

&quot;So, it does move...&quot; Yuuko began to say, but Icchan interrupted her.

&quot;Not &#39;IT&#39;... Misaki-chan!&quot; Icchan exclaimed. &quot;There is a genuine soul 
behind that face.&quot; Yuuko nodded apologetically.

&quot;You&#39;re right there, Icchan,&quot; Yuuko replied. She looked over to Shuuko. 
&quot;We have discovered something that shows some potential. It turns out 
that the philosopher Plato once mentioned an island in the general area 
that sunk into the ocean at around 9,000 BC.&quot;

&quot;And, what was the name of this island?&quot; Shuuko asked.

&quot;Antilia, although it goes by a much more recognized name: Atlantis.&quot;

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

A small group had gathered in the staff room. Icchan, along with his 
close aids, was there, along with Shuuko and Hatoko. Misaki-chan was 
flying around the tops of their heads. Shuuko&#39;s eyes were closed, as if 
she was daydreaming.

&quot;Before I continue, we are dealing with something that defies all known 
scientific laws. Therefor, we must process this information with one 
thing in mind: Anything is possible.&quot; Icchan started. &quot;Misaki-chan was 
murdered by a foul being, and yet she is her with us now, flying around 
in the body of a doll. Hatoko-chan can breathe underwater indefinitely. 
Both girls can summon storms, can change the wave patterns, and wreak 
havoc upon the entire Pacific Rim, from what we&#39;ve gathered. This is not 
a fairy tale. Furthermore, everything we talk about is confidential.&quot;

&quot;Chief Mihara... can I go to bed now?&quot; Oogata whimpered.

&quot;No. Go read the next book.&quot; Icchan ordered.

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Misaki-chan... Can you do me a favor?&quot; Icchan pretended to ask, and 
Oogata furiously pulled out the next book. &quot;Oh, wait... Never mind. 
Anyways, I will be leaving with Hatoko and Misaki in a few days for 
Europe to right this situation, we must gather all information available 
about the subject before then. Additionally, it has come to my attention 
that the murderer is still on the loose, however Hatoko believes she is 
somehow connected with the teacher that was killed just a couple days 
ago.&quot;

The group went silent for awhile, with nothing to say to start the day, 
and Shuuko picked up a book lying on the table, bookmarks sticking out 
of it. She opened to one of the bookmarks and began to read.

&quot;The Sun fell upon the sea, and night covered the world. The great 
temples shook in their foundations, the trees splintering as the island 
rumbled like a beast that had just risen. High Elder Yano stood upon the 
highest mesa at the top of the island, and willed his spirit to hold the 
island up, but it was a fruitless ambition, the dark magic at work had 
taken hold of the land, and the seawater washed over the soil.

&quot;Yano stood upon the solid rock as it descended into the sea, and called 
his daughters Mia and Miu to him. He instructed them to remember their 
love for each other, for all eternity. They agreed without delay or 
hesitation, pink dancing upon their cheeks, and as the water washed 
around their feet, a mighty wave crashed into them, and they 
disappeared. Yano stood amongst the chaos and cried, knowing full well 
it would be many thousand years before they would return.

&quot;However much Yano wanted to die that moment, he could not. The sea 
loved him so, it refused to kill him, and he whispered to the great 
blue, &#39;If such a grand seed could ever be planted in such a grand sea, 
let it be my daughters. Let their pure hearts live in this sea until 
they are ready to emerge in a new world. Let the sea teach them what it 
knows, let it strengthen their love for each other. And when the Great 
Balance arrives, let them be strong enough to fight it with their hearts 
and live with utmost happiness upon this world with each other, for all 
eternity.&#39;

&quot;Yano, exhausted, sat down upon the mesa, and until his daughters 
return, will not rise. When they arrive, it is foretold, the sea will 
finally let him rest in piece, and grant his knowledge to the girls who 
seek him so they may forever keep Atlantis alive in their hearts.&quot;

Shuuko rested the book upon the table, opening her eyes slowly and 
placing a hand on her head. The room watched her silently, Misaki-chan 
hovering over the blank pages of the book Shuuko held open against the 
table.

&quot;Shuuko-san has recovered another piece of this puzzle,&quot; Hatoko said, 
looking at the youthful woman intently. &quot;The sea was talking to her it 
seems.&quot;

&quot;There are no words on this page, Oogata, why did you bookmark a page 
with no words?&quot; Icchan asked, turning his head to stare intently at his 
employee.

&quot;Umm...&quot; Oogata began hesitantly. He must have bookmarked the page 
without thinking.

&quot;Icchan, I get the feeling I am somehow connected to this mess.&quot; Shuuko 
started, and Icchan turned to her.

&quot;As do I, you should come with us to Gibraltar. Of the people who 
receive messages, you are one of them.&quot; Icchan replied. &quot;Oogata, go 
reserve another ticket.&quot;

Oogata left the room at a fast pace, closing the door behind him to 
block out whatever Icchan might want to add to his request. He got lucky 
with this latest punishment, not to bad.

&quot;Shuuko-san, are you feeling alright?&quot; Hatoko asked, and Shuuko looked 
at the child.

&quot;I feel like the dark truth is trying to enlighten me. That name... 
Yano... He is the person we must seek when we arrive.&quot; Shuuko replied.

&quot;If that is so, what is the Great Balance? And, how are the daughters in 
the story... Mmm... Mia and Miu, connected with Hatoko and Misaki?&quot; 
Yuuko asked. The table went silent for some time, until Hatoko spoke.

&quot;I have a feeling that those girls were once Misaki and myself, long 
ago, however, I cannot figure out what &#39;Great Balance&#39; could mean.&quot;

&quot;I have a hint!&quot; Oogata exclaimed as he entered the room again. He 
looked through the books scattered on the table, only to withdraw a 
fairly modern history book about government. Opening the book to the 
first and only bookmark, he read, &quot;Plato once wrote that everything will 
naturally try to balance itself out. For every positive feeling or 
action, there will always be an equally negative feeling or reaction. 
All evil in this world occurs because of the good. And all good in this 
world occurs because of evil. In reference to governments, which Plato 
wrote about on many occasions, he once hypothesized that all corrupted 
governments in the world would create a nation of good people, and all 
good governments would create a nation of swindlers. However, because of 
the scale of both bodies, of nation and of government, it was actually 
always a mix.

&quot;Plato, however, was not prepared to say that, because of good always 
being canceled out because of evil, the world would seemingly get 
nowhere. He said there were always ways to sidestep the effects of good 
or evil by taking a path with both sides of the equation already mixed 
in.

&quot;A good example of this would be the gun. While it was created for the 
good, i.e. to hunt for food and to protect, it served the other purpose 
of killing fellow humans and launching countries into war many times. It 
shows that even with a constant issue of balance, the world can still 
advance through the ages.&quot;

Oogata set the book on the table, open to the page he had just read 
from. &quot;This is the only reference to Plato I found in this book, but, it 
might help.&quot;

&quot;Indeed, Oogata, you have earned the right to get everyone some morning 
pastries. Here&#39;s some money, go get some coffee for yourself too.&quot; 
Icchan pushed Oogata out the door once more. &quot;I am feeling good about 
today.&quot;

&quot;I feel like this information is all good, but... What about Misaki? We 
know she will live once more... But how?&quot; Hatoko asked, but once again, 
no one could say anything.

&quot;I believe Yano is the one that knows that, and no one else. We must 
understand the situation, and then when we go to the ruins of the 
island, we will be able to proceed with proper, but not undue, caution.&quot; 
Icchan said finally, and Misaki-chan nodded.

&quot;My thoughts... As well...&quot; Misaki whispered. Yuuko, along with a couple 
other of her associates, jumped slightly.

&quot;So, she can talk. Even while dead, that is some feat.&quot; Yuuko commented, 
and the angel in front of her turned and smiled, only to fly over to 
Hatoko and sit on her head.

&quot;Silly,&quot; Hatoko said softly, and Misaki-chan patted Hatoko&#39;s head.

&quot;Good... Hatoko...&quot; Misaki added, and the doll giggled soundlessly, 
rolling off Hatoko&#39;s dark hair, only to glide back to the table surface 
and draw on a sheet of blank paper with a relatively large pencil.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

The day carried on, buoyed much by the information that had been learned 
that morning. Icchan had devised a map with the general area in which 
Atlantis was rumored to be, marked in several areas which warranted 
exploration. Yuuko, being her resourceful and prepared self, made a list 
of all the things that should be brought, even a change of clothing for 
Misaki.

Oogata, even after two cups of coffee, had passed out twice that day, 
and it was Misaki-chan&#39;s duty to knock him awake, which she did in an 
artful manner each time.

Oujirou had visited that day as well, and Icchan wasn&#39;t prepared to tell 
him about what happened to Misaki, but it couldn&#39;t be helped, 
Misaki-chan was flying around the bewildered Oujirou&#39;s head the moment 
he walked in the door. He even wanted to go to Gibraltar, but Icchan 
refused.

&quot;We must keep the group small, we do not want to attract attention. I&#39;m 
sure the coast guard is going to have a fit if they find we are tossing 
a six year old into the water, which does concern me as well.&quot; Icchan 
turned to Hatoko, &quot;How good of swimmer are you anyways?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m okay at swimming, and because I don&#39;t have to worry about breathing 
or being cold, I should be okay. Misaki will be with me too, I can do 
anything when she is near.&quot; Hatoko replied confidently, and Icchan 
smiled.

&quot;Very true, from what I&#39;ve heard, you and Misaki make a great team.&quot; 
Icchan replied, satisfied with the answer. Oujirou wondered what Hatoko 
had meant, not having to worry about breathing and such, but left the 
room without any further questions.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

The day ended, and Hatoko followed Shuuko out to her car, only to run 
into a group of fans. Misaki quickly went into lifeless doll mode and 
severed her connection to the angel.

&quot;Is that your new angel Hatoko-chan?&quot; one asked.

&quot;Yes it is,&quot; Hatoko replied nicely, trying to find a way to escape the 
gathering. She was at least happy they hadn&#39;t recognized Shuuko, 
although of course, she wasn&#39;t with the trademark angel Athena. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry everyone, but I must get going.&quot;

She broke away from the group, waving kindly before dashing through the 
car door and closing it.

&quot;Hatoko, I have just realized something, you haven&#39;t been to the Piffle 
Princess lately to practice. Would you like me to take you there 
tomorrow morning?&quot; Shuuko asked.

&quot;I would love to go, of course, if I do go, Misaki-chan gets to beat 
everyone that asks about her. She needs to practice too, you know.&quot; 
Hatoko replied smiling.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.
