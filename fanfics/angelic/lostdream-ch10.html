<a href="../angelic/lostdream-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Well then, Chapter 10! Only a few more chapters after this one... What 
will happen? Hmm... One must read to find out!

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

A Spirit&#39;s Journey

&quot;True love is self love. True love is when two become one.&quot; Yano

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Hatoko was unable to sleep that night, excitement about the coming days 
pervading her every thought and dream. She found herself hoping that 
Misaki would be back the moment they arrived, but she knew in her heart 
there were still trials ahead that must be faced. She dozed off in the 
wee hours of the morning, only to be awoken by Kaede a few hours later.

&quot;Hatoko-chan... Hatoko-chan... It&#39;s time to get up...&quot; Kaede said 
softly, nudging the sleeping child. &quot;We will be leaving in twenty 
minutes.&quot;

&quot;Mmm...&quot; Hatoko replied groggily as she sat up, looking towards Kaede. 
&quot;Is it really? I feel like I haven&#39;t slept at all...&quot; Hatoko glanced at 
the clock. &quot;Hmmm...&quot;

&quot;No time to ponder, let&#39;s get you ready. Shuuko-san has some breakfast 
prepared for you already.&quot; Kaede replied, and she pulled Hatoko out from 
under the covers.

Several minutes later, Hatoko was dressed, eating her breakfast as Kaede 
brushed out her hair a bit. Sai was putting their bags in the car, and 
Shuuko was making a few phone calls.

&quot;Hmm... It looks like we aren&#39;t going to Gibraltar. Icchan has found a 
closer location to the suspected site. We are going to fly into Lajes. 
It&#39;s a city on an island in the Atlantic.&quot; Shuuko said after setting 
down the phone. &quot;From there we will be taking a boat West for a day or 
two. Our information says 321 kilometers.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s after that?&quot; Hatoko asked.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t imagine,&quot; Shuuko replied.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

The airport was crowded, and the group slowly made their way to the 
waiting area for their flight. Misaki had the clouds go away early that 
morning to make sure their flight was not interrupted. Hatoko held 
Misaki-chan as she walked along, holding Sai&#39;s hand as Icchan pushed his 
way through people ahead of them.

&quot;Oogata, don&#39;t do that here! People will think your... well...&quot; Icchan 
said out loud. Several people made way for the group.

&quot;What?&quot; Oogata whined. &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything!&quot;

&quot;I told you: No onions! Now look at you!&quot; Icchan exclaimed, pointing a 
finger at Oogata and squeezing his nose shut. &quot;I feel faint!&quot;

The group reached the appropriate desk for their flight, which would 
initially take them to Spain. It was a very long flight, to say the 
least.

Icchan finished talking to the lady behind the counter, and handed 
everyone their boarding passes. They walked over to the side of the desk 
and set down their things.

&quot;Everything is ready. While we wait, I think I&#39;ll let everyone in on a 
little secret I discovered by pure chance the moment I left the office.&quot; 
Icchan changed his voice to a whisper. &quot;Atlantis was also called 
Antilia. I discovered a day ago that Antilia was thought to be 321 
kilometers off of the West of the Azores. This morning, I pulled up an 
undersea topographical map of the Atlantic in that general area. We know 
that their is a plateau of sorts on the sunken island, right?&quot;

Everyone nodded.

&quot;Well, after examining the map, I discovered that there were no 
topographical features like that. I pulled up more maps from around the 
area, and found that there was only one possible location: 120 
kilometers in the same direction I found a rectangular mesa. I believe 
this is the one as Atlantis was rumored to be somewhat rectangular.&quot; 
Icchan explained.

&quot;How are we going to get there?&quot; Hatoko asked, interested.

&quot;I figured we would take a large catamaran, I have already contacted 
someone about transporting us out there. He said I was insane.&quot; Icchan 
answered, scratching his head.

&quot;Well, as far as anyone could be guessing, we are going out into the 
middle of nowhere, throwing a six year old off the side of a boat, and 
sitting around waiting for her to resurface.&quot; Yuuko stated, and everyone 
nodded. &quot;I think we are insane.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to be cold, Hatoko-chan? What if you get scared, or 
you can&#39;t see?&quot; Kaede asked.

&quot;Nope, I seem to be immune to the effects of cold water. As for being 
scared or being unable to see... I don&#39;t think I will be. Misaki will be 
there, and I am doing this for her. I do not have the option to not do 
this, you know.&quot; Hatoko replied, and the group nodded.

&quot;Misaki-sama is worth it, isn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;More then anything, Kaede-san.&quot;

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

The airliner had finally left the runway, and Hatoko watched as Tokyo 
faded away. Misaki-chan was standing on the armrest to watch as well, 
and Kaede, who sat next to Hatoko, leaned over to have a peek for 
herself.

&quot;It has been awhile since I have flown in a plane. It is quite an 
adventure.&quot; Kaede said softly. Hatoko nodded, staring out the window, 
but said nothing. &quot;Are you worried, Hatoko-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I do not want to lose Misaki.&quot; Hatoko replied, and Kaede rested 
her hand on Hatoko&#39;s lap.

&quot;I&#39;m sure it will all be okay, just have some faith in yourself.&quot;

&quot;Kaede-san, Misaki is becoming more lonely each day. Unlike I, she can&#39;t 
feel anything in this world. That is why, if we should fail, she will 
die sooner then me. We must succeed.&quot; Hatoko replied.

&quot;It will eventually come down to you though, are you ready to take on 
the responsibility?&quot; Kaede asked, and Hatoko turned to look at her.

&quot;I am ready to take it on. I refuse to let anything stand in my way.&quot;

&quot;What if that woman tries to stop you?&quot; Sai asked, leaning in on the 
conversation.

&quot;I will kill her without hesitation.&quot;

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Hatoko had fell into sleep, and Misaki again locked her into a perpetual 
dream until the airliner landed. She awoke feeling refreshed, and 
finding the rest of the group weary, led them all to the next terminal 
to board the flight to Lajes. Hatoko had insisted no time be wasted 
while traveling, and Icchan understood, booking the flights very close 
to each other. Since they had already crossed many time zones, their 
flight in Lajes would land at approximately the same time as the early 
morning for them. Of course, that meant that it would be bedtime in the 
Azores. Misaki had plans to keep the entire group in dreams to help them 
change sleeping patterns.

The second flight left Lisbon, and the weary travelers ate dinner aboard 
a near empty plane. The attendants seemed to recognize most of the 
group, and attempted to talk to Shuuko in English. Shuuko didn&#39;t have a 
clue as to what they were saying, and Icchan did his best to translate.

&quot;Oh! They watch Angelic Layer on TV!&quot; Icchan said excitedly. &quot;I wonder 
if it&#39;s time to go global...&quot;

The flight continued on, and Icchan chatted in broken English for most 
of it, explaining to the attendants that he was the creator of Angelic 
Layer. They kept asking Icchan to bring Angelic Layer to Europe, to 
Icchan&#39;s delight. A few hours later, the plane landed, and to the dismay 
of the flight attendants, the group said their goodbyes.

Finding their way to a local bed and breakfast after grabbing their 
bags, everyone prepared for the night ahead. Icchan shared a room with 
Oogata, who wasn&#39;t in the least happy about it. Shuuko shared a room 
with Yuuko, and Hatoko shared one with Sai and Kaede, of course.

Kaede put Hatoko to bed almost immediately, and then went to take a 
quick shower after Sai had finished taking her own in the small 
bathroom. Shortly later, everyone was in bed, and Misaki put their 
willing minds to sleep, even though she had not told them in advance 
they would be watching the waves crash on the shore for the next eight 
hours. She made sure to keep the image of her and Hatoko out of the 
dream this time, knowing Icchan and Oogata especially wouldn&#39;t 
appreciate it very much.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

The Sun rose, and everyone awoke, feeling a bit off schedule, but never 
the less ready to start the day. Hatoko was unusually hyper as they ate 
breakfast together.

&quot;Hatoko-chan, you really should eat something instead of talking...&quot; 
advised Kaede.

&quot;But, I need to swim... Swim with the fishies in the big blue sea...&quot; 
Hatoko replied and she made a fish face as she sipped at her orange 
juice. &quot;Mmm... Fish food!&quot; It was readily apparent that Hatoko was 
slightly nervous.

&quot;Talking about fish... Hatoko-chan, you mentioned you were unable to 
&#39;connect&#39; with Misaki-chan while you were wearing a swim suit,&quot; 
mentioned Icchan.

&quot;I did, all I can take with me when I go is this pendant. Misaki-chan 
will come with me as well.&quot; Hatoko answered, playing with her food.

&quot;The angel will not work if its exposed to the water, Hatoko-chan.&quot;

&quot;Misaki has the ability to form a small barrier around the angel, so 
water will not be able to penetrate her skin. And, since water is so 
like the air, she can fly right next to me as well.&quot; Hatoko folded her 
toast and bit a whole right out of the middle, only to unfold it and 
hold it up. &quot;Hmm... Fish shaped!&quot;

Breakfast ended, and the party left for the docks to meet the captain of 
the boat they would be taking. Icchan had reserved the entire vessel, 
and so it would be a private trip. Owning a very large company had its 
perks.

A warm air floated around everyone, and a few sparse clouds could be 
seen in the sky. The smell of salt water and fish floated through the 
city, and the locals gave disconcerting looks as the odd group passed 
them by. Arriving at the docks, Icchan spotted the catamaran and 
everyone followed the mad scientist over to it. The captain of the boat, 
a gruff looking fellow with a mellow attitude, greeted them all, and 
Icchan spoke in his best English, letting him know they were ready. An 
hour later, the vessel, named &quot;Seaker&quot;, left the port for the open 
ocean.

&quot;You&#39;re crazy as hell, Ichirou. I&#39;ll give ya that. There is nothing in 
the area of water where we are going.&quot; the Captain said as he steered 
the large boat to the West.

&quot;We are on voyage to save life, Trent.&quot; Icchan replied.

&quot;Who&#39;s life? Everyone looks alright to me.&quot; Trent pointed out, and 
Hatoko, getting the gist of what they were saying, spoke up.

&quot;Misaki!&quot; Hatoko exclaimed quite suddenly. &quot;This is for her!&quot; Icchan 
translated the message.

&quot;Ah, a young one with us. Misaki? Is this your friend?&quot; Trent asked.

&quot;Yes, Misaki is her friend... Well... More then friend, but... That is 
different story.&quot;

&quot;It sounds to me like Misaki is a girl...&quot; Trent questioned Icchan, 
looking cross-eyed.

&quot;Umm... She is...&quot;

&quot;I meet the most peculiar people, you know that?&quot; Trent replied, 
laughing as he brought the vessel to top speed.

&quot;Umm... What does &#39;peculiar&#39; mean?&quot; Icchan asked, but the old captain 
just laughed.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

It was nearing midday when they arrived at the general location, and Sai 
went to tell Hatoko it was time for lunch, only to find the small girl 
staring intently at a patch of water.

&quot;Is it down there?&quot; Sai asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; came Hatoko&#39;s response. &quot;It is calling to me.&quot; She pulled out the 
pendant from under her clothes, only to find it glowing brighter then 
usual.

&quot;It is lunch time, Hatoko-chan.&quot;

&quot;We must make it quick then, I can feel Misaki... She is longing greatly 
to go down there with me.&quot; Hatoko replied, and she stood up. Sai took 
her hand firmly, and led her back to the main deck for lunch.

&quot;Strangest thing I&#39;ve ever experienced, five hours and not a single 
swell!&quot; Trent roared heartily. &quot;Like the sea was making way for my 
boat!&quot;

&quot;See that necklace?&quot; Icchan pointed to the pendant around Hatoko&#39;s neck. 
&quot;That is why.&quot; The captain turned to look, only to find himself suddenly 
enchanted by the glowing object.

&quot;What... What is that?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Misaki.&quot;

The captain ran his fingers through his gray beard and stared intently 
at the pendant.

&quot;What is that glowing?&quot; Trent asked.

&quot;Soul trapped in small capsule of seawater.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not serious, are you?&quot;

&quot;Totally.&quot; Icchan replied. &quot;Misaki-chan, please prove to Trent-san you 
are there.&quot;

Hatoko held up the pendant for all to see, and water began to drip off 
it&#39;s surface in great amounts. Trent didn&#39;t know what to say.

&quot;Now, you at least know we are not totally insane.&quot; Icchan said. Trent 
nodded. The sound of an approaching vessel could be heard in the 
distance, and Sai, still standing, looked on the horizon to find a small 
black craft speeding towards them at a staggering pace. It was only a 
few minutes away.

&quot;Icchan-san, what...&quot; Sai began, and Icchan turned to look.

&quot;What are they doing out here?&quot; Icchan asked. Misaki-chan came to life 
and spread her wings, to the amazement of the old sea captain. She 
floated up.

&quot;Something... Not right...&quot; Misaki said loudly, and the captain looked 
around furiously to find where the words came from. &quot;Be... Back... 
Soon...&quot;

The small angel disappeared as it flew at blinding speed towards the 
craft. Misaki-chan came back twenty-three seconds later. &quot;It is... Her.&quot;

&quot;She is going to ram into us then, it seems.&quot; Icchan thought out loud, 
and the angel nodded.

&quot;Sit... Down...&quot; Not knowing what to think, everyone sat down. Trent 
started to say something, but stopped and stared at the beautiful angel 
floating in the air. &quot;Her Time... To Go... Is Now.&quot;

The pendant around Hatoko&#39;s neck grew intensely blue, and a wave 
appeared in front of the speeding craft quite suddenly. The craft sped 
through it, but came out severely slowed. Storm clouds rushed in, and 
sea became turbulent as the pendant radiated deep blue rays of light. 
Sweeping waves bristling with foam and anger filled the great blue sea, 
but the vessel continued to crash through them. It was now one minute 
away, and its powerful engines could be heard over the great storm. Hail 
began to fall, and it slammed into the black fuselage, putting holes in 
the plexiglas, but the vessel continued its charge.

Trent, watching the entire thing, began to sit up, but Icchan pulled him 
down.

&quot;Watch. The power of love.&quot; Icchan said, and Trent turned back to watch. 
The craft darted forward. 100 meters. 50 meters. 25 meters. Icchan began 
to sweat, and then it happened. A great barrier surrounded the entire 
catamaran, and the speedboat slammed into it, exploding into a cloud of 
debris, smoke, and fire. Misaki dropped the barrier, and calmed the 
seas. She floated silently over to the wreckage. The woman, who was 
miraculously still alive, clung to a life jacket. She stared at the doll 
in the sky.

&quot;I killed you, you wretched creature.&quot; She spat. Misaki ignored her.

&quot;What is your name.&quot; The angel commanded, softening the woman&#39;s mind 
with the energy from her heart.

&quot;Sayoko. Your mother knows me well.&quot;

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.
