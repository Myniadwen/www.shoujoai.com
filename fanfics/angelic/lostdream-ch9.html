<a href="../angelic/lostdream-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Well then, I&#39;m back from me trip. Fresh ideas decided to follow me back 
as well... hmm... Slightly adult language in one part in this one, no 
big deal though really...

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

Rising of Shadows

&quot;The only assumption you should ever make is that you shouldn&#39;t make 
assumptions.&quot; unknown source

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

It was now one day before Hatoko would depart on her trip to the island 
of Gibraltar. Final preparations were being made in a number of places. 
Icchan was busy wrapping up a study of the water around the suspected 
area of the fallen island, and Shuuko was assisting with this process 
where possible. Sai and Kaede had already packed their bags and were 
staying with Hatoko at Shuuko&#39;s residence. When Shuuko heard of the two 
teenage girls wanting to come along as well, she gladly accepted.

A dark sky had descended over the whole of Tokyo City. It hung so slow, 
Hatoko got the feeling the sea was trying to protect her and Misaki, 
blowing a thick mist over the land.

&quot;Hmm... Very dark clouds. Rain?&quot; Kaede asked, feeling a bit inquisitive 
as she leaned towards Sai. Sai only looked at Hatoko.

&quot;Seems like the sea is preparing for our departure...&quot; Hatoko said, but 
Misaki found reason to speak at that moment.

&quot;My doing...&quot; Misaki whispered, and the three girls looked at the 
Misaki-chan doll on Hatoko&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Anyone... Against us... These 
clouds... Will...&quot; Misaki&#39;s voice ended abruptly, and Hatoko finished it 
for her.

&quot;These clouds are prepared to strike them down. It has happened once, it 
will happen again if need be.&quot; Hatoko explained softly, and remembering 
the fall of the teacher at the school grounds, she went to hug Kaede.

&quot;These storms, the rumor is, killed the teacher at your school. Did 
Misaki-sama do that?&quot; Sai asked with little apparent emotion.

&quot;Yes, Misaki summoned them to protect me.&quot; Hatoko responded, and her 
eyes moistened at the thought of the incident. The blood spilling 
effortlessly onto the concrete, and the pieces of a shattered skull at 
her feet... it was a scar that would remain for some time. &quot;The sight of 
it was horrible.&quot;

&quot;I am glad Misaki-sama was there for you,&quot; Sai added, &quot;The sight of 
death is not a good sight.&quot; Sai looked towards Kaede. Kaede put her arms 
around Hatoko. &quot;I was with my younger sister when she died.&quot;

&quot;Sai-san... Let&#39;s take Hatoko-chan for a walk outside.&quot; Kaede suggested, 
and Sai nodded. Hatoko looked up at the older girls and smiled slightly.

The air carried a minor chill, but curiously little wind. Hatoko and Sai 
walked down the side of the street, Kaede in the middle holding both 
their hands, and feeling quite special at that. No people could be seen 
on the street, and few cars rolled along the darkened asphalt, as if the 
people suspected another chaotic storm to strike down another 
individual.

&quot;Misaki won&#39;t let it rain or hail unless we are in danger, so if it 
turns out someone is trying to trouble us, a little bit of water will be 
the least of our worries.&quot; Hatoko explained. Misaki-chan rested on her 
shoulder, wings closed, but discreetly turning her head to look for 
trouble.

&quot;Hatoko-chan, it seems that after this excursion and you revive 
Misaki-sama, you and her will be granted immortality and a permanent 
power to change and create water, storms, and seas. What do you think of 
this?&quot; Sai asked, quite out of the blue. It was several moments before 
Hatoko could say anything as she pondered the question.

&quot;I do not know what to expect, really. However, I do realize, that if me 
and Misaki are immortal... There will be a point in time when we will 
have lost all of our current friends.&quot; Hatoko replied, the thought 
streaking despair across her face.

&quot;You will have Misaki-sama, won&#39;t you?&quot; Kaede asked. Hatoko nodded.

&quot;It is true that I will always be next to Misaki, and it is true that I 
could not have wished for anything better, but... It is also true that 
there are many people on this world that are important to me, and who 
are mortal, like you two... I cannot even begin to imagine a world 
without you two, walking with you through the hallways of the arena, or 
eating sandwiches on grassy hills after matches... I suppose it is the 
way it must be though.&quot; Hatoko replied sadly. &quot;Oogata-san, that strange 
guy from Angel Layer Company that is always sticking noodles up his 
nose, read from a book that Plato, and quite possibly the person we are 
visiting, believed that for every positive effect or feeling, there will 
be an equally powerful negative effect or feeling in order to balance 
them both. Plato said that the universe will constantly try to maintain 
balance among these things.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re saying, your immortality is paid for in emotional pain as 
your old friends die from age?&quot; Sai asked.

&quot;That seems to make sense, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Hatoko replied quietly. &quot;I do 
want to find a way to over come it though, I want to be able to be with 
my friends forever.&quot;

The group of girls turned a corner, and the sight of Shuuko&#39;s house was 
lost. Hatoko looked back, only to see a shadowy figure watching them 
from across the street. Hatoko stopped moving and turned. Sai and Kaede 
quickly realized this and turned to look at the figure. It began to run 
towards a hedge along side the road that Hatoko walked on, and she 
called desperately to Misaki.

&quot;Misaki, that person! They are getting closer!&quot; Hatoko exclaimed. She 
pulled Sai and Kaede away from the hedge, stepping backwards. Another 
shadow raced after the first, and the rain began to pour. A rustle could 
be heard in the bushes to the left, and a shadow emerged. A hailstone 
slammed into their back almost immediately, and the figure was dashed to 
the ground. Another rustle in the foliage, and two female shadows 
emerged, one chasing the other until the first, who was faster, jumped 
into a car that could not be seen and drove way. Hatoko turned to look 
at the victim of the hail, horror spreading across her face. Short, 
black hair, dripping wet. Dirty white clothing. No, a uniform... It was 
Kotarou. Hatoko turned away.

&quot;No... Not... Ko...&quot; Hatoko begun, &quot;I... Don&#39;t want to believe...&quot;

&quot;Kotarou-kun is not... Against... Us...&quot; Misaki started. &quot;Hatoko-chan... 
Help...&quot;

Hatoko, hearing Misaki&#39;s sweet voice call her name, turned to look at 
her fallen brother. He was looking at her, a slight smile on his face, 
and noticeably in pain.

&quot;So, that is the way it is... Hatoko, Why wasn&#39;t I allowed to know? Why 
wasnt...&quot; Kotarou asked, before a cough racked his throat, after which 
he continued. &quot;Why wasn&#39;t I allowed to know?&quot;

&quot;Are you okay, Kotarou?&quot; Hatoko asked desperately.

&quot;Why?&quot; Kotarou repeated. &quot;Am I, a good friend of Misaki-san&#39;s, not 
allowed to know when she is killed and mysteriously transferred into a 
doll? When she and my sister are prompted to set out on a dangerous 
journey?&quot;

Hatoko remained silent, staring at her brother, not know what to think. 
He had done something very foolish, following her, risking death at 
Misaki&#39;s own hands.

&quot;Kotarou-chan... It was my decision.&quot; Misaki stated, somewhat 
forcefully. &quot;I did not... did not want for you... to get involved...&quot;

Kotarou stared at the doll on Hatoko&#39;s shoulder. The rain mysteriously 
bounced off of an invisible force field around the angel. Kotarou 
watched it closely for a few moments longer, only to see it spread its 
wings and fly to within a few inches of his face, and land gracefully. 
&quot;Why?&quot; he asked again.

&quot;Dangerous...&quot; Misaki replied simply.

&quot;But, you are letting Sai-san, and Kaede-san.&quot; Kotarou argued. Sai and 
Kaede stood silently a dozen feet away. Hatoko looked at Misaki-chan and 
her brother, not moving either.

&quot;They... Understand... Us...&quot;

&quot;Kotarou, Sai and Kaede understand our relationship, and they understand 
pain and loneliness in similar ways that me and Misaki do. With that 
understanding comes the correct wisdom necessary to bring Misaki back. 
And then, here you are, stalking us, thinking you want to get involved 
without knowing anything of the sorts.&quot; Hatoko explained, getting angry 
now, &quot;Do you even understand the critical nature of this whole thing? 
Misaki will be gone forever if we fail. Her loneliness will kill her 
soul, and then it will kill me because I can no longer survive without 
her.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Kotarou started, a desperate voice escaping him.

&quot;Idiot!&quot; Hatoko cried out, tears escaping her eyes, and sheets of rain 
falling. &quot;It is Misaki that chooses who goes right now. I trust her 
decision, and even though you&#39;re my brother, that won&#39;t stop me from 
following her, the most important thing in the world to me. If it came 
to it, I would kill you before letting Misaki die.&quot; Hatoko looked down 
at her feet. &quot;Misaki is more valuable then anything in this world, to 
me. Kotarou, you are no longer the person I turn to for help, don&#39;t you 
realize this?&quot;

Tamayo peeked around the corner of the shrubbery as Kotarou dropped his 
head at his sister&#39;s words.

&quot;What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing, Kotarou!?&quot; Tamayo yelled at 
him, coming over and helping him up. Kotarou, who didn&#39;t realize Tamayo 
was there in the first place, was shocked out of his senses now. He 
looked towards his girlfriend.

&quot;What are you doing following me?&quot; Kotarou replied loudly, rubbing his 
back where the ice struck him.

&quot;Following you? I saw you sneaking around in the bushes, and then saw 
this woman going for you with this knife or something. I chased her down 
only to find that she was going after Hatoko-chan, who was hidden from 
my sight by the shrubs at the time. I ran over to beat her up, and she 
ran off, saying some crazy thing or other like &#39;Devil child, don&#39;t 
defend those that are unnatural. Let them rot into the soil!&#39;&quot; Tamayo 
explained, only to shock Hatoko, along with Sai and Kaede.

&quot;That woman, who is she?&quot; Kaede asked cautiously.

&quot;No clue,&quot; Tamayo responded, and she turned back to Kotarou. &quot;As for 
you, why in the world did you jump out of the bushes at Hatoko-chan?&quot; 
Kotarou blushed slightly.

&quot;Umm... Well... I sorta tripped...&quot; Kotarou looked at the ground 
grimacing. &quot;Although... Now that I think of it... What did I trip on?&quot; 
He looked back, only to find a puddle of water where he had emerged from 
the hedge. There was nothing blocking the way near the ground, however.

&quot;Whatever, Kotarou, we are going home to clean you up.&quot; Tamayo turned 
back to Hatoko. &quot;I realize that there is something very important to you 
and Misakachi happening right now, and that it is your affair even if I 
am a friend. I&#39;m sorry if Kotarou or myself frightened you, Hatoko-chan, 
as well as Sai-san, Kaede-san.&quot; Tamayo apologized.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Tamayo-chan, unplanned things happen.&quot; Hatoko replied, and 
Kaede nodded.

&quot;We are all okay, just a bit excited I guess. No worries, okay?&quot; Kaede 
added sweetly.

&quot;Oh! Here, the woman dropped this when I nailed her in the back with my 
elbow...&quot; Tamayo handed Hatoko a silver black dagger. Hatoko took it 
carefully, and Tamayo parted for her house, dragging Kotarou behind. 
Hatoko dropped her hands to her sides, and walked over to pickup 
Misaki-chan with her free hand.

&quot;That... Is the one...&quot; Misaki whispered.

&quot;The one? The dagger used to kill you?&quot; Hatoko asked quietly. 
Misaki-chan nodded.

&quot;And... The Woman... The Do&#39;er.&quot; Misaki replied. Hatoko grimaced.

&quot;Let&#39;s go home now, Hatoko-chan.&quot; Sai said, and she picked the small 
girl up in her arms. &quot;Let&#39;s go home.&quot;

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.

The door shut, and the three soaking wet girls made their way to 
Misaki&#39;s bedroom, where Sai gently put Hatoko onto her feet. She took 
the dripping dagger from her hand, and placed it on the small desk in 
the corner. Hatoko spoke nothing, still regathering herself after the 
incident. She hated having to speak to her brother so harshly, but he 
nearly got himself killed for his idiotic antics. Again, Hatoko 
remembered what dangers they were dealing with.

&quot;Hatoko-chan, why don&#39;t you take a bath?&quot; Kaede suggested, and Hatoko 
nodded silently. Taking her hand, Kaede walked Hatoko to the bathroom. 
Misaki-chan flew slowly behind them.

&quot;I know you&#39;re wishing Misaki-sama was here, but right now it is not 
possible. However, if you need anything, me and Sai-san are always 
available.&quot; Kaede explained, and Hatoko nodded. They entered the 
bathroom and Misaki-chan flew over to the bathtub and turned on the 
water. Kaede helped Hatoko remove her wet clothing, and made her way to 
the door.

&quot;Kaede-san...&quot; Hatoko whispered, and the older girl turned around. 
&quot;Please, stay with me. I want you to stay with me... Someone to talk to. 
I would talk to Misaki, but it requires much concentration of hers to 
speak to me normally, and I don&#39;t want to pressure her. I don&#39;t want her 
worrying about me right now. She trusts you, you know.&quot;

&quot;Okay, anything, for you and Misaki-sama, like I said.&quot; Kaede set the 
wet clothes on the floor and went to assist Hatoko into the water. In a 
few minutes, the tub was full, and Misaki-chan turned off the faucet. 
The angel floated on her wings over to Kaede&#39;s shoulder and sat down.

Hatoko closed her eyes, and let her body slip under the surface of the 
water completely. Kaede moved to help her head up, but Misaki-chan flew 
to face her directly and put up her hand.

&quot;Hatoko-chan... Breathe water...&quot; Misaki explained, and Kaede nodded, 
resting her hands on her knees as she sat down.

&quot;Oh, that is right...&quot; Kaede replied, watching the small child rest 
under the water. Misaki had shared a memory with her, a nice memory that 
made her dozy, and Hatoko was now drifting of to sleep.

&quot;Kaede-san... Wish to see... What Hatoko-chan sees?&quot; Misaki asked, and 
Kaede nodded.

&quot;If you want to share, I&#39;d love to see it.&quot; Kaede replied, and her eyes 
closed almost suddenly, and a memory overtook her senses.

...

The soft sunlight filtered through sparse clouds overhead, and a warm 
breeze drifted along the sandy beach. Hatoko lay next to Misaki on a 
blanket under the shade of a beach tree. The sound of crashing waves 
could be heard off in the distance. No one was around but the two girls.

Eyes closed, they spoke softly to each other in whispers. Words of love, 
and dedication. Filling words that feed the spirit and quenched the 
soul. Many words, and it did not stop. They merely continued. Hatoko had 
wrapped her arms around Misaki, and Misaki had her arms wrapped around 
Hatoko. Their heads were very close, and every time they spoke, their 
soft lips brushed.

...

Misaki let Kaede out of the memory after a few minutes, but kept Hatoko 
under the warm recollections as she slept soundly under the surface of 
the bath water.

&quot;To think, that people of your age, could share something like this... 
It is astounding. Plus you two are cute.&quot; Kaede smiled. &quot;Hold onto that 
memory for a long time, Misaki-sama. When you are lonely, think of it, 
and remind yourself that you will have it again soon.&quot;

Sai entered the bathroom, closing the door behind her. She looked at 
Hatoko, interest showing on her face as she watched the small girl defy 
death.

&quot;She asked me to stay,&quot; Kaede explained, and Sai nodded, sitting next to 
her. She wrapped an arm around the smaller girl&#39;s waist and pulled her 
close.

&quot;It is alright, we are all together. Tomorrow we leave. Once the trip 
starts, we do not know what will come of it. We should enjoy this time 
together to the best of our abilities. We do not know who will be 
returning, especially since we have some mad woman after Hatoko-chan.&quot; 
Sai replied.

.o.o.o.o.o.o.o.
