<h1>Sisterly Love or Something Else</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../steelangel/index.html">Steel Angel Kurumi</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/link4.html">Link48010</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ok, this is my first attempt at a shoujo-ai; I&#39;m typing this one as a 
test so tell me what you think.

This is a story set within the events of episode 1 of Steel Angle 
Kurumi Encore. Saki finally gets her wish.

For those of you who don&#39;t know, here is a little background; Saki was 
originally forced activated by an electric shock, which Kurumi 
accurately put as fighting in her sleep. She was ordered to destroy 
Kurumi, and as she was about to make the final blow ran out of &quot;juice&quot;. 
Due to Kurumi&#39;s jealousy she would not allow Nakuhito to activate Saki 
with a kiss like he activated Kurumi, so Kurumi activated Saki herself. 
The reason Saki first fell in love with Kurumi was because of the 
program in her brain telling her to teat her master (the one who 
activated her) as the most important person in the world.  The program 
worked like a charm, if not a little to good. Until I wrote this story 
Saki has yet to &quot;get&quot; with Kurumi:( *Poor Saki, she always saves people 
at her own expense then gets forgotten about after battle*
*Note: italicized words are thoughts, this story is told only from 
Saki&#39;s point of view. 
_____________________


&quot;It&#39;s not fair,&quot; I thought as I was thinking about my trip to Hollywood 
alone (she lives in Japan).&quot;Nakuhito is nice and forgiving and all, but 
so am I. I think I disserve attention too, especially from you... 
Kurumi.&quot;  *Sigh* I was sitting at the table across from Kurumi who was 
next to Nakuhito, and his brother Kamuhito was to my right, Kirinka 
already finished and left, I think she got a love letter or something. 
I wasn&#39;t eating much because I was thinking so much.

	&quot;What&#39;s wrong Saki?&quot; asked Kurumi.

	&quot;Uh... nothing really.&quot;

	&quot;Well something has got to be bothering you, your not eating... and 
you love kettle rice.&quot;

	&quot;I was... thinking about someone.&quot;

	&quot;Who is that?&quot;

	&quot;I... uh...&quot;

	&quot;Is it someone you like?&quot; asked Kurumi excitedly.

	&quot;Um yes... kind of,&quot; I replied.

I left after quickly answering that question, before she could ask 
anymore (I was sure that I was blushing). That&#39;s when I heard them. 

	&quot;Aww, come on master I wanted to take a bath together,&quot; asked Kurumi.

	&quot;I said I was too tired, I am going straight to bed, after all we&#39;ve 
got a big day tomorrow seeing Saki off,&quot; was his reply to her. 

	&quot;Ok I&#39;ll go... by myself,&quot; said Kurumi in a boohoo like voice.

	&quot;Yes, now is my chance to spend some time with Kurumi&quot; 

 	&quot;What is with that look on your face Saki, you&#39;re blushing.&quot; 
Nakuhito had snuck up behind me. 

	&quot;Aaa... nothing at all, notta thing, I was just... nothing.&quot;

	&quot;Ok I can&#39;t let him keep doing that, now as soon as Kurumi gets in 
the bath I&#39;ll come in and join her... and then well, owww I can&#39;t wait, 
all I have to do is act really sad about my trip to Hollywood to butter 
her up... and... then...we&#39;ll...&quot;*blush* &quot;oh I can&#39;t stand it, I love you 
so much Kurumi, well here goes nothing&quot;

	I tried to be as quiet as possible as I came up to Kurumi who was 
sitting in the bath half sobbing, probably because she wasn&#39;t with 
anyone. &quot;That feeling won&#39;t last long&quot; as I walked up behind her.

	&quot;Sis, Kurumi, do you mind if I join you.&quot;

	&quot;Hm what, oh no, not at all come on in.&quot;

	&quot;Thanks. By the way Kurumi, I wanted to talk to you about something.&quot;

	&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

	&quot;When I&#39;m going on this trip to America to act, I&#39;m going to get very 
lonely.&quot;

	&quot;Hmmm, I can see how that would happen, is that all you wanted to 
say.&quot;

	&quot;Well what I meant is that I will get lonely without you Kurumi, 
because well, you see.&quot;

	Kurumi flinging her hands around me and hugging me tightly cut me off. 
&quot;Oh this is so great, they&#39;re right against my face.&quot;

	&quot;Aww, you&#39;re so sweet Saki, I could just squeeze you,&quot; blurted out 
Kurumi.

	&quot;Aaa Kurumi, hmm, well you see, I said that because I love you Kurumi&quot;

	&quot;You&#39;re too cute, I love you too Little Sis.&quot;

	&quot;No!  No, not Little Sis, I don&#39;t mean it that way. Kurumi I mean it 
like... like you love Nakuhito.&quot;

	&quot;Wha... what do you mean by that.&quot;

	By this time I had finally gotten up the nerve to do this. I put my 
left hand on her shoulder and my right hand on the back of her head. Then 
I reached forward and kissed her on the lips. Oh it felt so good, I 
finally got to get my first kiss from the women I love, well, 
technically my second kiss but it felt like the first because the first 
one was when I was basically asleep. She really had the lips of an 
angel, they where so soft. As we separated she muttered up, &quot;but my 
lips are only for master.&quot;

	&quot;I know Kurumi, but you don&#39;t see, you are my master, you awakened 
me with a kiss when we first met, remember, you gave me life and I love 
you for that. I feel the same way as to do, but towards you. My lips are 
only for master, you.&quot;

	&quot;I. I. see. Oh Saki, I love you too&quot;


       Lemon

	This time she reached forward and kissed me. It was slow and 
passionate, which told me she really meant it this time, not as a sister, 
but as a lover. The kiss ended after seconds or minutes, I couldn&#39;t tell, 
but when out lips separated it felt like I had been given a taste of 
heaven, and I wanted more for myself and especially for Kurumi. I put my 
hand on her back and the other on her left hip and pulled her closer to 
me. My boobs pushed up against hers. I kissed her again, this time hers 
and mine tongue touched and rapped around each other. My lower hand 
dropped a little to her left inside hip. A little nod and &quot;Saki&quot; was all 
she said. 

	I slowly stroked her inner thigh before moving upwards. She tipped 
her head back as my fingers did their work on her labia. At this time my 
right hand moved up and softly cupped her well-shaped breast, slowly 
messaging them. Her hands had found their way up to my breasts, she 
drew slow circles around my nipples. She cupped them and started squeezing 
them softly. I finally decided this was going to go all the way so I 
took my fingers and pushed them up inside of her, feeling her virginal 
barrier on the tips of my fingers. She gasped a little and looked at me 
with that slight &quot;its ok&quot; kinda smile that I love so much. I pushed 
through and she let out a loud moan, almost a scream.
	
	 She grabbed my hips and lifted me clean out of the water and sat me 
one the edge of the tub. Her hands slowly pulled apart my knees. &quot;Oh my 
God, she&#39;s actually going to do it.&quot; At the first moment she touched me I 
drew in my breath. &quot;Oh please Kurumi, don&#39;t stop, please don&#39;t stop,&quot; 
is what I think I said. She kept going but only for a few more seconds 
then stopped, &quot;No. Please don&#39;t sto.&quot; When I least expected it I felt her 
fingers at my opening, they slowly pushed through to my physical 
innocents. &quot;Oh Kurumi, please do it, please go through.&quot; She hesitated 
for a second and made little circles, which made me catch my breath. 
Then she pushed through very quickly, plunging her two fingers all the 
way inside of me. With that my head flung back and I uttered I muffled 
scream. Oh my God it felt so good. I put my hands in her hair, bucking 
against her hand. I climaxed at this point, I was kind of disappointed, 
I planed on her coming first, but God it felt good.

	She moved her fingers around in little circles. Then she pushed her 
thumb up against my clitoris bringing out another muffled scream. I 
slipped back into the tub and did the same to her with my fingers. She 
climaxed first and I followed shortly afterwards thanks to her hand. We 
fell exhausted into each other&#39;s arms and finished our bath with a nap 
in the bed, with our arms wrapped around each other. 

					The End

	My thoughts
I originally wanted for this story to be longer, mainly the area above 
the lemon, but sadly enough I only have a 24kps Internet connection 
speed (to put that into contrast it would take me 17.5 hours to 
download a 30 minute flash file which is supposed to be fast). So the 
reason being that it took me almost an hour and a half to upload this much 
to my email program (uploads at about 12kps). Also Saki and Kurumi already 
had a relationship built up in the series so I really didn&#39;t have much 
room to play around with. My original idea was going to be between 
Kirinka and Saki, but if you&#39;ve ever seen the series you and me both 
know Kirinka would never go for anything like this, so Kurumi&#39;s 
forgiving and innocent personality it was. Curse me and my style that 
keeps to the original story of the characters, I like to keep it 
realistic enough to make it seem that the characters might actually do 
or have done something like this in the series. Hope you enjoyed it, 
tell me what you think.</pre>
