<h1>Ryoko's Evening Out</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/overstreet.html">Clayton Overstreet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I don&#39;t own these characters or profit from them. I&#39;ve decided to do a 
request fic. People asked me to show that5 Ryoko wasn&#39;t a perfect 
angel and other asked for an OVA Mihoshi-Washu lemon. If that part 
isn&#39;t here double-check my fics at www.tmffa.com

------------------------------------------------------------

  Ryoko grinned as she and Ryo-ohki trailed after the ship. Tenchi and 
the others had forbidden her to attack any more Jurai merchant ships 
or any of their allies. Still a girl has to keep busy and their 
protection didn&#39;t include the enemies of the Jurai Empire.
  She checked the readings and licked her lips. There was some solid 
Durillium on that ship. It was a special metal that bent light around 
it and allowed a person&#39;s aura to show. You could tell a person&#39;s 
emotional state by whatever color it was at the time, provided you 
knew what color it should be for that emotion. It was worth over three 
thousand Jurai an ounce.
  Ryo-ohki heard the mental command and dashed forward cutting through 
a hydrogen cloud like a knife, lasers firing at key points in the 
ship. Ryoko felt a thrill going down her spine and wished that Tenchi 
were there with her. Shopping was always so much fun.

  Aeka yawned and rolled onto her back smiling up at the ceiling. It 
was so nice to be back in Tenchi&#39;s house in her own room. Spending all 
those months looking for Tenchi and sharing an apartment with Ryoko 
had been... not bad. Just not really enjoyable and she&#39;d missed her 
family.
  Still she had a date with her old boss from the city next weekend. 
He&#39;d been surprised when they&#39;d just quit and left. When he&#39;d called 
Aeka had answered and promised to tell him all about it. That should 
be fun, she thought.
  Sighing she stood up and tiptoed out into the hall. She walked 
quietly down the hall, ignoring the snored from all the other rooms.
  &quot;At least I know I&#39;m not the only one.&quot; She muttered. Stopping 
outside Sasami&#39;s room she slid it open a crack and peeked in at her 
sister. Sasami was sleeping soundly, looking even more adorable than 
usual, and making a small whistling noise as she breathed. Aeka slowly 
closed the door and headed for the stairs.
  She froze briefly when the door to Washu&#39;s lab opened. Tenchi backed 
out smiling and holding a velvet case. &quot;Thanks Washu, I&#39;m sure Ryoko 
will love it.&quot;
  &quot;It&#39;s no problem Tenchi. You fulfilled your end of the deal.&quot;
  Tenchi frowned. &quot;Don&#39;t remind me. And remember you promised never to 
bring it up again.&quot;
  &quot;Interesting choice of words...&quot; Washu said and cackled.
  Tenchi sighed. &quot;Goodnight Washu.&quot;
  &quot;Goodnight Tenchi.&quot; He shut the door and turned around.
  Aeka began walking down the stairs. &quot;Hello lord Tenchi.&quot;
  Tenchi looked up startled. &quot;Oh, hello Aeka. I didn&#39;t wake you up did 
I?&quot;
  &quot;No, I just came down to get a drink of water.&quot; She said. Her eyes 
traveled to the case in his hands. &quot;Is that for Ryoko?&quot;
  &quot;Yes.&quot; He said flatly, looking apologetic. &quot;Look Aeka...&quot;
  &quot;No. It&#39;s okay. I understand.&quot; She said quickly. &quot;I was just 
wondering what it was.&quot;
  He smiled and turned it around. &quot;Well since I got back Ryoko has 
been going out so often to get us all gifts...&quot;
  Aeka nodded. &quot;Yes I know. I&#39;ve been seeing the news reports.&quot;
  Tenchi blushed. &quot;Well she&#39;s only attacking people who are against 
Jurai anyway and they aren&#39;t blaming you. She hasn&#39;t killed anybody 
who didn&#39;t attack her either.&quot;
  &quot;Yes, I know. You don&#39;t condone it do you?&quot; Aeka asked.
  &quot;No... I just understand her that&#39;s all. She... she needs to do that 
stuff. It&#39;s part of who she is. I&#39;ve known that since we met. She&#39;s a 
killer.&quot;
  There were so many questions on her mind, but Aeka shrugged it off 
and nodded at the case again. &quot;So?&quot;
  Tenchi opened it and smiled. Aeka blinked as something flashed in 
her eyes. When her vision cleared she saw a ruby lying on the black 
velvet interior of the case. It was set in a silverish metal Aeka 
couldn&#39;t identify. The stone seemed to throb like a heart as she 
stared at it. It was heart shaped and almost seemed to glow in the dim 
light from the kitchen that illuminated the room.
  &quot;It&#39;s... wow.&quot; She breathed. Her teeth ached with longing as she 
looked at the facets.
  &quot;Yeah. Washu agreed to get me something that Ryoko wouldn&#39;t break. 
She installed some force field or something so it can be touched but 
not broken or smudged.&quot;
  &quot;Do you think I might...&quot; Aeka realized she&#39;d been reaching for the 
box and drew her hand back. &quot;I mean could I talk Washu into making 
something like that for me?&quot;
  &quot;Well I had to do something for her to get it.&quot; Aeka didn&#39;t inquire 
what.
  &quot;I&#39;ll... talk to her tomorrow then.&quot; Aeka said. Tenchi closed the 
box and the spell was broken. She shook her head and smiled. &quot;Well 
have a nice evening lord Tenchi.&quot; She passed by him towards the 
kitchen.
  She&#39;d just reached the door when something came to her mind. 
&quot;Tenchi?&quot;
  &quot;Yes Aeka?&quot; He asked from the foot of the stairs.
  &quot;Back when we were in the dimension tuner and Ryoko had you helping 
her to rob those banks. Did you ever enjoy it?&quot;
  &quot;No... not the robbing. But afterwards there were times we&#39;d be 
driving to our hideout and I&#39;d look over at her.&quot;
  &quot;Yes?&quot;
  &quot;She&#39;d be looking at the horizon.&quot; His eyes unfocused and he looked 
out the window by the door at the stars outside. &quot;Or maybe at the 
night sky. She&#39;d talk about us going everywhere and getting whatever 
we wanted and I couldn&#39;t help thinking that no matter what else she 
did I could live with anything if it made her smile.&quot;
  &quot;I see.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;You know some people might see killing and 
robbing...&quot;
  &quot;Aeka, I know how you feel. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
  She watched him head back upstairs, went to the kitchen, and got her 
drink. It was a long night, but Aeka spent it at the table looking out 
the window.

  Ryoko growled at the image on the screen. &quot;Nagi? What are you doing 
here?&quot;
  &quot;I was after these smugglers. What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;
  &quot;I&#39;m after their cargo. And I&#39;ve been trailing them for hours! I got 
here first!&quot;
  &quot;No you didn&#39;t! I&#39;d just tied the last of them up when you started 
blasting away at the ship!&quot; She stood back and pointed at the bound 
men and women piled against the console. &quot;Wait a minute... what 
cargo?&quot;
  Ryoko smiled and shrugged. &quot;Just something I was going to pick up 
for Tenchi and the others. Would you like some?&quot;
  &quot;Some?&quot;
  &quot;Okay half! And you&#39;re lucky I don&#39;t blow the whole thing up right 
now.&quot;
  &quot;Deal.&quot;

  Sasami yawned and stretched as she went towards the kitchen. She 
always got up early to make breakfast for everyone. It wasn&#39;t that 
hard since Jurai&#39;s dawn happened three hours before Earth&#39;s. She was 
surprised to see Aeka sipping a glass of water at the table.
  &quot;Good morning Aeka. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be up this early.&quot;
  &quot;I was just enjoying the sunrise.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;Did you sleep well 
Sasami?&quot;
  &quot;Yes. I had a dream that I had a spaceship made of cotton candy.&quot; 
She smiled and sat down across from her sister. &quot;How about you?&quot;
  &quot;Oh, I was just thinking.&quot;
  &quot;About Tenchi again?&quot; Sasami asked.
  Aeka looked down at her and frowned. &quot;Yes, but not what you&#39;re 
thinking. I just realized that he&#39;s far from perfect.&quot; She paused. 
&quot;How do you feel about what Ryoko does for fun?&quot;
  &quot;I...&quot; Sasami stopped and looked down. &quot;I don&#39;t like it. It kind of 
scares me. But she&#39;s our friend and wouldn&#39;t hurt us right?&quot;
  &quot;Right.&quot; Aeka admitted. &quot;I didn&#39;t tell Tenchi about this but 
Noboyuki said the same thing.&quot;
  &quot;Oh.&quot;
  &quot;Yes. But not Tenchi. He honestly doesn&#39;t care as long as she 
doesn&#39;t hurt us or Earth. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s right.&quot; Aeka took a deep 
breath. &quot;I care deeply about Lord Tenchi and have grown... accustomed 
to Ryoko.&quot;
  &quot;But?&quot; Sasami asked.
  &quot;But I don&#39;t think I&#39;m in love with him any more. It was different 
when he killed Kagato to defend us.&quot;
  &quot;Do you wan to leave?&quot;
  &quot;No...&quot;
  &quot;Well then what?&quot;
  Aeka sat there and thought about it. Finally she said, &quot;I think I 
want to date.&quot;

(Following scene began in &#39;The perfect gift&#39; but I decided to reuse 
it)

  Washu sat in her lab watching the world around her though monitors. 
She read the data on a supernova three galaxies over. She had been 
trying to figure out if destroying a nova would allow you to reset 
time or if it would trap someone in a quantum loop.
  Something glowed at the corner of her eye. She turned around and saw 
Tsunami standing behind her. &quot;Hello sister.&quot;
  Tsunami nodded. &quot;So you remember after all.&quot;
  Washu smirked. &quot;Yes, I know all about who I was.&quot;
  Tsunami nodded again, &quot;I see you also miss it.&quot;
  Washu raised her eyebrow. &quot;What makes you say that?&quot;
  Tsunami motioned towards the machines. Each one monitoring a 
different part of the universe. &quot;You must. You have done your best to 
recreate your ability to see the whole universe at once. You must have 
accomplished what you were after when you became mortal if you want to 
go back already.&quot;
  Washu chuckled. &quot;&#39;Already&#39;? It&#39;s been twenty thousand years Tsunami. 
And anyway what makes you think I want to go back?&quot;Tsunami reached 
forward and turned off Washu&#39;s computer. &quot;Because you&#39;ve stopped doing 
what you came to do.&quot;
  Washu shook her head. &quot;No I haven&#39;t. Why did you turn off the lab? 
How do I find out about life if I can&#39;t study it?&quot;
  Tsunami smiled pleasantly. &quot;You used to know the answer to that. 
Washu... when you were a goddess you knew everything. Why would you 
need to become human just for that?&quot;
  Washu shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t remember. Too many painful memories 
have replaced it.&quot;
  Tsunami nodded. &quot;I know Washu. But you can&#39;t get rid of pain like 
that by avoiding it. You&#39;ve hidden away for too long sister. Why don&#39;t 
you make some new memories?&quot;
  Washu looked up at her and shook her head. &quot;But what if I get hurt 
again? What if this family is taken away from me? I can&#39;t protect them 
as much out there.&quot;
  Tsunami nodded one last time. &quot;I know, but that doesn&#39;t matter. You 
know that.&quot;
  Washu nodded back and smiled. &quot;Thank you sister.&quot; Tsunami faded back 
into the darkness of the lab.
  Standing up Washu looked around her at the machines and monitors 
around her. He form wavered and blurred slightly around the edges. The 
tiny doll she had used as her body for so long fell to the ground at 
her feet. SlowlyWashu turned around to leave. &quot;I&#39;ve been here too 
long.&quot; She walked out the door and into the living room. Inside the 
lab was dark and silent.

  Mihoshi yawned and stretched out on the couch. She had been laying 
in a nice warm sunbeam and had fallen asleep. She says up and looked 
around. &quot;Hi Washu, what are you doing out here?&quot;
  Washu smiled at her. &quot;Well I finished what I was working on in my 
lab. Is it alright if I talk with you?&quot;
  Mihoshi shrugged and smiled. &quot;Sure. What do you want to talk about?&quot;
  Washu smiled and asked, &quot;Well for one thing I would like to know how 
you keep so calm all the time. It&#39;s like once something&#39;s done you 
don&#39;t care anymore.&quot;
  Mihoshi leaned back on the couch and looked up at the ceiling for a 
minute. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I used to worry about all the stuff I did and 
might do. It kind of burned me out. That&#39;s why I was assigned to such 
a remote area. But once I came here... it just didn&#39;t seem to matter 
anymore. No matter what happens it&#39;s always unpredictable and whenever 
something bad does happen we always beat it and things get right back 
to normal.&quot;
  Washu knew that what Mihoshi said was right. Washu lay back on the 
couch as well. &quot;So what do you do?&quot;
  Mihoshi shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Want to take a bath?&quot;
  Washu looked up at her in surprise, but decided that if she were 
going to learn to take things in stride she&#39;d just have to go along 
with it and see what happened. &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; They got up and walked 
out the door towards the floating baths.

  In the baths Washu sat talking with Mihoshi. &quot;So you really don&#39;t 
want Tenchi anymore?&quot; Washu asked absently.
  Mihoshi sighed and leaned back. &quot;It&#39;s not that. I just know he isn&#39;t 
meant to be my husband. I will never leave his side, but that isn&#39;t 
the same thing. We&#39;re all friends and family here&quot;
  Washu sighed and splashed some water. &quot;I know what you mean. You and 
I... we aren&#39;t really meant for him are we? We are part of his family, 
nothing more. Sometimes I think Sasami knows more than all of us.&quot; 
Mihoshi blew bubbles in the water. &quot;So is there... anyone else?&quot;
  Mihoshi sat back and smiled in a dull kind of way. &quot;Not really. I&#39;ve 
been kind of busy since my last partner died. You?&quot;
  &quot;No.&quot; Washu said casually and picked up some water. She poured it 
down her neck and let is slide over her chest. &quot;Not since my husband 
and that was twenty thousand years ago.&quot; Washu licked her lips as 
Mihoshi let her body float on the top of the water. &quot;You look a lot 
like him.&quot;
  Mihoshi pushed off from the side and slowly floated towards her. 
&quot;Really? Are we related?&quot;
  Washu realized that Mihoshi was staring about six inches below her 
face. &quot;Uh... maybe. But if we are it&#39;s so many generations removed by 
now that it really wouldn&#39;t matter.&quot;
  Mihoshi giggled and pushed closer to Washu. &quot;That what wouldn&#39;t 
really matter?&quot;
  &quot;Hey! I recognize police questioning techniques when I hear them you 
know!&quot; Washu said quickly. &quot;I&#39;m a super genius remember?&quot;
  Mihoshi sat up next to her and smiled. &quot;In that case what do you 
think I&#39;d be asking for?&quot;
  Washu grinned. Just because you recognized something didn&#39;t mean it 
wasn&#39;t effective. But just in case she reached out and ran a hand over 
Mihoshi&#39;s thigh. It felt like warm silk.
  &quot;Good guess.&quot; Mihoshi breathed and leaned in. Washu felt their lips 
touch and kissed back, slipping her tongue into the officer&#39;s mouth.
  &quot;Mmm.&quot; Washu said pulling back. &quot;Is this where you cuff me and teach 
me a lesson?&quot;
  Mihoshi giggled. &quot;Maybe later.&quot;
  Washu grinned and stood up, putting her crotch level with Mihoshi&#39;s 
face. &quot;Goods. It&#39;s been twenty thousand years and I don&#39;t think I 
could wait for you to get them.&quot; She pressed her hand into the back of 
Mihoshi&#39;s head urging her forward.
  Mihoshi, while a bit slow sometimes, can take a hint and leaned her 
face into the tuft of red hair and pink flesh in front of her. Washu 
put one foot on the edge of the bath so that Mihoshi would have room 
as the blonde&#39;s hands gripped her ass to help her keep balance. Also 
for the sake of argument let&#39;s assume Mihoshi&#39;s species is the same 
one from &#39;Earth girls are easy&#39; and that she has a six-inch tongue. 
(Got to give the pubic... public what it wants.)
  Washu felt Mihoshi&#39;s lips press into her crotch and moaned as her 
tongue snaked out and licked into her. Pressing back she rubbed her 
pussy into Mihoshi&#39;s face and whispered, &quot;Oh gods that&#39;s good.&quot;
  Sucking slightly Mihoshi pulled her tongue out and nibbled her teeth 
at Washu&#39;s clit. She was rewarded when the walls of the scientists&#39; 
vagina contracted and began leaking. Mihoshi licked it up and sat back 
down. She was surprised when she let go of Washu&#39;s ass and the 
scientist fell back into the water, splashing her.
  &quot;Hey...&quot; She began. Then Washu surfaced right next to her. Without a 
word she leaned down and locked her mouth over Mihoshi&#39;s nipple and 
began sucking. &quot;Hey...&quot; Mihoshi repeated quietly.
  Washu&#39;s teeth worked slowly over the skin and Mihoshi groaned in 
joy. Then she gasped as Washu reached down and unceremoniously shoved 
two fingers into her pussy. &quot;Ah! Wait... let me get used to...&quot; She 
was interrupted by too more fingers and Washu&#39;s evil laugh. The red 
head was now sucking her way up Mihoshi&#39;s neck and kissed the startled 
detective as her vagina contracted spasmodically around Washu&#39;s 
digits.
  &quot;I don&#39;t think you want me to wait for you to get ready do you 
Mihoshi?&quot; She asked in a husky voice and nibbled on her earlobe. 
Mihoshi tried to answer, but was cut off as she pushed her fingers in 
harder and deeper, spreading them out and rubbing the walls of her 
pussy.
  Her jaw trembling Mihoshi shook her head and closed her eyes. She&#39;d 
come already, but Washu didn&#39;t seem about to remove her fingers. 
Instead she managed a roll and moved onto Mihoshi&#39;s legs facing her 
and leaning in for a kiss. Mihoshi responded in kind and found her own 
hand moving towards Washu&#39;s crotch. She tried t shove in her own 
fingers, but found they couldn&#39;t fit.
  &quot;What...&quot;
  Washu grinned and winked at her. &quot;Now you know why it&#39;s &#39;Little&#39; 
Washu.&quot;
  Her hand shaking Mihoshi slowly pushed in her thumb. It seemed to 
fit for the most part. Above her Washu shivered and leaned back, 
pressing a breast into Mihoshi&#39;s mouth. Sucking softly she looked up 
at Washu&#39;s face and through the haze of hormones got a nasty idea. Her 
index finger pressed into the crack of Washu&#39;s butt and them slid in 
before the scientist realized what was happening. Her eyes widened and 
her head snapped down to stare in shock at the blond beneath her.
  Mihoshi momentarily expected to be asked to stop, but Washu began to 
rotate her hips and push into it. Mihoshi did the same and suddenly 
both of them came at the same time. With a sigh both collapsed back 
into the water and relaxed.

  The end
