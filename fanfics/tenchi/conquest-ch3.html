<a href="../tenchi/conquest-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Ryouko smiled warmly, looking honestly pleased at Ayeka&#39;s decision to 
eat here with her again. She smoothly got up out of her chair and 
gracefully pulled out the seat right beside her own, &quot;Would you care 
to sit down?&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ayeka smiled, as Ryouko gently pushed the chair in behind 
her. She uncorked a bottle, pouring some into a glass beside Ayeka, 
before refilling her own.

Ryouko sat back down and activated a small device on her wrist, 
&quot;Another for dinner please, Asashi.&quot; She listened for a moment, &quot;Thank 
you.&quot; Ryouko looked up at Ayeka, &quot;Your plate should be here in a 
minute or so.&quot;

&quot;Fast service,&quot; Ayeka noted.

&quot;Sasami&#39;s helping out tonight, I think,&quot; then Ryouko chuckled softly, 
adding, &quot;The foods much less spicy this time.&quot; Ayeka looked rather 
relieved, and Ryouko smiled.

&quot;I was reading some of the library files,&quot; Ayeka said to her softly, 
&quot;and I found them to be quite interesting.&quot;

&quot;Which files?&quot; Ryouko asked her a bit nervously. She quickly tried to 
remember where her private collection of lewd novels were hidden on 
the data-base, and if Ayeka could have been able to access them 
somehow.

&quot;Mostly on your government, and the organization of the Republic of 
Manticore,&quot; Ayeka said, giving Ryouko an odd look. &#39;I wonder what 
other files are in there?&#39; she mused, and resolved to try and find 
out..

Just then the nearby door opened up, and Sasami and Asashi came out 
bearing the plates carrying Ayeka&#39;s dinner. Ryouko tried not to look 
too relieved at the distraction. &quot;Here you go,&quot; Sasami said with a 
smile.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ayeka smiled at the two young ladies. &quot;Are you having fun 
together?&quot; she asked them curiously.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Asashi enthused. &quot;I&#39;m learning so much about cooking from 
Sasami! She doesn&#39;t use enough spices, though,&quot; she finished with a 
cute little frown.

Both girls left, and only then did Ayeka chuckle softly. &quot;I&#39;m glad 
Sasami cooked this,&quot; she said with a smile.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind Asashi&#39;s cooking,&quot; Ryouko admitted, &quot;but I know I&#39;m in 
the minority about that.&quot; They shared quiet laughter. &quot;So, you were 
reading about Manticore,&quot; Ryouko said, &quot;what do you think of it?&quot;

&quot;It was very educational,&quot; Ayeka answered her coolly. She took a deep 
breath before saying, &quot;My father had claimed that Manticore attacked 
Jurai first.&quot; Ryouko opened her mouth to protest that, so she held up 
a hand to stop her, &quot;But my mother has confirmed what you data had 
told me, that we, Jurai, had started it.&quot;

There was a moment of silence at the table, as Ryouko considered what 
to say. &#39;Well, I guess I was right in letting the ladies live,&#39; she 
thought. &#39;But even I didn&#39;t know that the Emperor had lied,&#39; she 
thought to herself grimly.

&quot;I&#39;m deeply sorry,&quot; Ayeka said softly, trying to meet Ryouko&#39;s eyes, 
&quot;for the harm my people wrought on yours.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not your fault,&quot; Ryouko replied softly. She got out of her chair 
and walked to the viewport, looking down at Jurai. &quot;It explains a 
lot,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I sent a diplomat to Jurai early on, to try 
and negotiate for peace. She never came back.&quot;

&quot;You went through all our databases for any sign of her?&quot; Ayeka asked, 
sounding honestly concerned about the missing diplomat.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Ryouko answered her quietly.

&quot;There are some encryption&#39;s, passwords that you may not know about 
yet,&quot; Ayeka said to her hesitantly, &quot;Do you have a link to the royal 
mainframe? I could try them.&quot;

Ryouko turned to Ayeka, looking a bit startled. &quot;Why are you doing 
this? I&#39;m the enemy, remember?&quot; she asked her pointedly.

A flush appeared on Ayeka&#39;s cheeks, and she obviously struggled to try 
and reign a flare of her temper. &quot;My father may have done a great 
wrong,&quot; she answered her calmly, &quot;and I&#39;m honor bound to try and do 
something about it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ryouko said softly. &quot;Let&#39;s try it, then,&quot; she said, 
offering Ayeka her hand and pulling her to her feet, &quot;there&#39;s a 
terminal not far from here.&quot;

Ryouko set the brisk pace down a nearby hallway, leaving their two 
dinners cooling on the table behind them. &#39;Oh, well,&#39; Ayeka thought 
wryly, &#39;I wasn&#39;t that hungry, anyway.&#39; They reached a unmarked door, 
and Ryouko slapped her hand up against an identification plate. After 
a moment, it hissed open, and she led Ayeka inside. It wasn&#39;t the 
computer room that Ayeka had expected to see, but instead a bedroom.

Piles of clothes were scattered about the room, along with the 
occasional bottle. The bed was rumbled and messy, but mostly cleared. 
A chair, small table, and closet made up the rest of the furnishings. 
&quot;Who&#39;s quarters are these?&quot; Ayeka asked.

&quot;It&#39;s mine, actually,&quot; Ryouko admitted. She dragged a chair over to 
the wall, and activated the computer terminal built into it.

&quot;But,&quot; Ayeka said, surprised, &quot;but it&#39;s smaller than my quarters.&quot;

Ryouko chuckled softly at that. &quot;You&#39;re in the guest quarters,&quot; she 
shrugged. She worked the interface for a moment, then she nodded in 
satisfaction. &quot;I&#39;ve patched it in to the Jurai mainframe,&quot; she said to 
Ayeka.

Ayeka leaned forward and quickly punched in her password. &#39;Yosho,&#39; she 
typed, and a new window opened up on the screen. Ayeka watched as 
Ryouko quickly navigated the system, eventually calling up a series of 
files.

Ryouko tried not to notice that as Ayeka bent over, her breasts were 
right beside her face. She gulped, and focused on the computer 
terminal. Working diligently, she searched until suddenly, she 
exclaimed, &quot;Yes!&quot;

&quot;Did you find something?&quot; Ayeka asked, bending closer to look at the 
screen.

A cloth covered breast brushed Ryouko&#39;s cheek, and she nearly lost her 
train of thought. &quot;Nagi&#39;s alive,&quot; Ryouko said, smiling, &quot;imprisoned, 
but alive!&quot; She quickly back tracked to her own command network, and 
instructed that Nagi be released from her prison.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Ayeka said softly. The relief and happiness on Ryouko&#39;s 
face surprised her yet again. &#39;She really cares about her people,&#39; she 
thought.

Ryouko got up out of the chair and took a startled Ayeka&#39;s hands in 
her own. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said softly, &quot;it would have been weeks, 
maybe even months before we found her otherwise.&quot; She looked into 
Ayeka&#39;s eyes, her own flashing with energy, then she suddenly crushed 
Ayeka to her body, kissing her fiercely.

Ayeka was surprised, stunned as she was pulled into the circle of 
Ryouko&#39;s strong arms. She felt her lips parting on their own, 
surrendering to the sweet kiss, and a fire started to race through her 
slim body. &#39;What&#39;s happening to me?&#39; she thought to herself 
feverishly, then she suddenly pushed Ryouko away from her.

&quot;What in the world,&quot; Ayeka choked out, backing away from Ryouko. She 
turned and fled, pushing the door open and running down the hallway.

&quot;Please, wait,&quot; Ryouko started to call outr to her, then she stopped. 
She slumped, leaning against a wall as she swore to herself softly, 
&quot;Shit.&quot;

Ayeka ran by Asashi and Sasami, right into her bedroom, and locked the 
door behind her. She leaned against the door, trying to catch her 
breath. She was shaking slightly, reaction racing through her body as 
her pulse began to slow down.

The deeply hurt expression that had been on Ryouko&#39;s face when she 
fled her appeared in Ayeka&#39;s mind&#39;s eye, and for a moment she felt a 
stab of pain in her chest. &quot;What is wrong with me?&quot; she hissed out.

She suddenly remembered the innocent question that Sasami had asked 
her, just after she told her about how Ryouko had proposed their 
political marriage, &quot;How could she have fallen in love with you so 
quickly?&quot;

&#39;Was she right about her all along?&#39; Ayeka found herself wondering. 
She stood shakily, and walked over to lay down on her bed, covering up 
her face with her arm. She tried not to think about how she felt 
around Ryouko, the racing of her heart and the warmth her gaze caused.

&quot;I can&#39;t be falling in love with her,&quot; Ayeka said in a whisper, &quot;I 
just can&#39;t.&quot;



&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Minagi asked her softly. Ryouko had been pacing 
Minagi&#39;s room silently for nearly ten minutes, eyes closed and her 
expression grim.

&quot;I may have screwed things up spectacularly,&quot; Ryouko said with a sigh. 
She recounted what happened between her and Ayeka the night before, 
finishing with, &quot;I lost control, and kissed her. I thought she was 
enjoying it, but she pushed me away, and ran.&quot;

&quot;You jumped the gun a bit,&quot; Minagi noted, &quot;that&#39;s for certain.&quot; She 
shook her head, &quot;Give her some time to calm down a bit, first of all.&quot; 
She thought about it, and added, &quot;Go to her later this morning, and 
apologize.&quot;

Ryouko nodded glumly. &quot;She&#39;ll probably be scared to be near me from 
now on,&quot; she said to her with a sigh.

&quot;Maybe, maybe not,&quot; Minagi said thoughtfully. &quot;when I talked to her 
last night, she was kind of disappointed about not being asked to dine 
with you again. And then she did seek you out to eat dinner with you, 
right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, she did,&quot; Ryouko agreed. &quot;But it could be she&#39;s just looking 
for a new friend,&quot; she said with a sigh.

&quot;Or she could be attracted to you,&quot; Minagi smiled, &quot;and be a bit 
frightened of the idea. I know that females together aren&#39;t that 
unusual on Jurai, but it&#39;s not discussed in polite society, either. 
She may not know what to do.&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Ryouko said softly. Her eyes brightened as she remembered 
something else, &quot;I just got some good news to give you, Minagi.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Minagi said, &quot;And what would that be?&quot;

&quot;Nagi&#39;s alive,&quot; Ryouko said with a grin.

Minagi whirled around to face her, &quot;What?&quot; A broad smile appeared on 
her face as she quickly demanded, &quot;Where is she? Is she all right?&quot;

&quot;They didn&#39;t kill her, just tossed her in prison,&quot; Ryouko grinned. 
&quot;She&#39;ll be here in a few hours, tops,&quot; she added. &#39;It was good to see 
the sparkle in Minagi&#39;s eyes,&#39; Ryouko thought, &#39;a sparkle that&#39;s been 
absent while her lover was missing.&#39;

&quot;Thank you!&quot; Minagi exclaimed, hugging Ryouko fiercely.

&quot;Thank Ayeka,&quot; Ryouko shrugged, &quot;without her password it would have 
taken weeks to find her, at least.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Minagi said with a firm nod. She looked at Ryouko worriedly, 
&quot;I only have a few hours to get ready?&quot;

Ryouko laughed softly, &quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; She stopped in the 
doorway and looked back to see Minagi cleaning her rooms frantically, 
and chuckled again. She headed down the hallway and then took the lift 
down to the bridge.

Kiyone stood behind the gunnery officer, instructing her. &quot;You see,&quot; 
she pointed out, &quot;when you took this shot, you left the ship 
vulnerable to their return fire.&quot;

&quot;So why didn&#39;t the simulation shoot me down?&quot; he asked her timidly.

&quot;The window of opportunity was very small, and the computer decided 
that the shot was too difficult for your simulated opponent,&quot; Kiyone 
explained to him patiently. &#39;Of course, I made the shot on my own 
simulation, but I won&#39;t mention that,&#39; she thought with a smile.

&quot;I&#39;ll do better, ma&#39;am,&quot; the pink hared young man assured her.

&quot;Good, Nicole,&quot; Kiyone said with a nod. She noticed Ryouko on the 
bridge and snapped off a salute, &quot;Admiral on the bridge!&quot;

Ryouko rolled her eyes at that. &quot;I&#39;m not an admiral,&quot; she grumbled to 
her softly. She relented as Kiyone gave her puppy dog eyes, &quot;So how&#39;s 
the training going?&quot;

Kiyone stood straight, &quot;We&#39;ve reached a 90% win ratio,&quot; she reported, 
&quot;but I feel certain we can add a few points to that.&quot;

&quot;Good work,&quot; Ryouko admitted, knowing how difficult the simulations 
that Washu had devised for them really were.

Kiyone checked her chronometer. &quot;The Galaxy Police liaison we invited 
should be arriving soon,&quot; she noted, and a little smile teased her 
lips. &quot;Can I go down to greet them?&quot;

&quot;You really like jerking their chains, don&#39;t you?&quot; Ryouko asked Kiyone 
with a smile.

&quot;Just deserts,&quot; Kiyone said with a shrug. &quot;They canned me after I 
helped you save innocent lives,&quot; she said with a bit of anger in her 
voice, &quot;so it seems only fair that now they have to come to you for 
permission to even exist.&quot;

A brown haired woman with a military bearing came on the bridge. 
&quot;Honor Harrington reporting to relieve you, ma&#39;am,&quot; she said, crisply 
saluting.

&quot;I am relieved,&quot; Kiyone answered her formally, returning the salute. 
She and Ryouko walked over to the lift together.

&quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple,&quot; Ryouko pointed out to Kiyone reasonably 
once they were on their way up.

&quot;Now that Manticore controls Jurai as well, the GP will need to 
operate in our territory to do their job in even the most minimal 
way,&quot; Kiyone said coolly. With a small smile she added, &quot;Not to 
mention the budget they used to get from Jurai&#39;s rulers. They&#39;re going 
to have to come to you with hands outstretched.&quot;

&quot;We do still need them around,&quot; Ryouko said mildly in return. Deciding 
to try and change the subject, Ryouko asked Kiyone softly, &quot;Would you 
mind if I ask you a personal question?&quot;

Kiyone looked a bit startled, &quot;Certainly, but I won&#39;t promise to 
answer it.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fair enough,&quot; Ryouko admitted. &quot;How did you and Mihoshi become 
involved?&quot; she asked her softly.

Kiyone smiled slightly, &quot;I didn&#39;t take her too seriously at first, I 
just thought she had a crush. It wasn&#39;t until she resigned from the GP 
in protest over my firing that I began to take her a bit more 
seriously.&quot; She chuckled softly, &quot;Not long after we both joined your 
employ, she made it quite clear that she wasn&#39;t just interested in me 
as a friend.&quot;

&#39;Not much help,&#39; Ryouko thought. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she answered her softly.

&quot;So are you having any luck with winning over Ayeka?&quot; Kiyone asked 
her.

Ryouko looked at her in surprise, &quot;How did you know?&quot;

&quot;The look on your face whenever you used to talk about her,&quot; Kiyone 
said with a shrug.

Ryouko rolled her eyes and decided not to answer that. </pre>
