For a certain class of customer, Juri decided to open the Locket a 
little later. It wasn&#39;t that some of them couldn&#39;t just come in 
earlier, but it was a bit more comfortable to come in at night. Of 
course, that also made things a bit more... interesting.

The pale blond in the blue army uniform smiled, and Bones smiled back 
at her tentatively. She had found out how strong she was personally, 
and was quite careful not to cross her. &quot;Good evening,&quot; she smiled, 
and pulled the door open. The girl was nearly a head shorter than her, 
but when those red eyes met her&#39;s Bones felt a chill.

She nodded to Hitomi, and made her way through the thinning crowds of 
the late evening to the bar, where Minagi smiled at her. &quot;Hi, 
Victoria,&quot; she said.

Victoria Ceras climbed up on a stool, giving her a smile. Without 
asking a small glass of something deep red was sat before her. 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Victoria smiled, and tossed it back smoothly. She set it 
down, and from a old fashioned wine bottle Minagi refilled it.

&quot;A few of the others were in tonight,&quot; Minagi said conversationally. 
&quot;Miyu, Seya, and I think I saw Susan and Death around, though with 
them it&#39;s hard to tell,&quot; she shrugged.

&quot;Remind me to stay out of Seya&#39;s way,&quot; Victoria said quietly, &quot;she&#39;s 
just a little too intense for my tastes.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of intense,&quot; Ryouko ambled over, &quot;do either of you know that 
intense white hared girl sitting over there?&quot;

Victoria turned in her seat, and her eyes widened, &quot;Integra...&quot;

&quot;You know her?&quot; Ryouko asked. &quot;I&#39;ve seen her in a few times talking to 
the boss, but other than that she doesn&#39;t mix much,&quot; she reported.

&quot;She&#39;s my boss,&quot; Victoria said softly.

Minagi saw the girl go pale, well, paler, anyway, and hastened to 
reassure her, &quot;Juri&#39;s been keeping an eye on her, and if she wasn&#39;t 
sure of her, she wouldn&#39;t still be coming here.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go over and say hi?&quot; Ryouko suggested.

Victoria&#39;s scarlet eyes got wide, &quot;That&#39;s easy for you to say.&quot; She 
shook her head, &quot;She&#39;s as tough as they come, nothing scares her and 
she never runs from anything.&quot;

&quot;Well, good evening, Victoria,&quot; Juri nodded and smiled at her. She 
rummaged around in the bar a moment before grabbing a bottle of whisky 
and a clean glass, then she headed straight for where Integra was 
sitting.

&quot;Whisky, neat, right?&quot; Juri asked as she reached Integra&#39;s seat. The 
white hared woman looked up and nodded, so Juri poured, before taking 
a seat across from her.

The light glinted off her glasses as Integra tipped her head back and 
downed it all. She shuddered, visibly, then relaxed just a bit. 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said quietly, and Juri topped her drink up. She reached 
into her dress coat, drawing a thin cigar out and lighting it. She 
drew on it deeply, &quot;How is it that a Japanese bar can be accessed in 
the middle of Britain?&quot;

&quot;Trade secret,&quot; Juri shrugged. In fact, she couldn&#39;t explain how Washu 
had managed it even if she tried. She looked over at Integra Hellsing 
thoughtfully, this aristocratic young lady who held herself in such 
iron control. It had taken two or three visits before she would even 
begin to drink, and Juri rather suspected that she had the place fully 
checked out before hand.

&quot;In other words, you can&#39;t explain it either,&quot; Integra said 
perceptively.

Juri had to smile at that. &quot;So how are your romantic prospects going?&quot; 
she asked. Talking to her last time, Integra had hinted that there was 
someone she was interested in, but then she just clammed up on the 
subject.

&quot;They&#39;re not,&quot; Integra said, taking another drink. She hesitated a 
moment, then, &quot;She doesn&#39;t even know I&#39;m attracted, hopefully.&quot;

Juri&#39;s eyebrows shot up at that. &quot;Why hopefully?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Because she&#39;s an officer under my comand,&quot; Integra explained 
patiently, &quot;and therefore I can not risk becoming involved with her.&quot;

&quot;So you remain celibate,&quot; Juri made it a statement, not a question.

Integra nodded, her expression carefully bland. Juri shifted over 
slightly, the crowd parted, and her eyes widened as her face grew 
pale. &quot;Victoria,&quot; she whispered softly.

&quot;You know her?&quot; Juri said, surprised.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to get out of here, right now,&quot; Integra blurted, rising from 
her seat.

Juri grabbed her arm, restaining her carefully as she said, &quot;If you 
bolt, you&#39;ll draw even more attention to yourself.&quot;

A fierce look passed Integra&#39;s face, but at Juri&#39;s urging she sat 
down. She reflexedly tidied her suit, making sure it sat on her 
neatly. &quot;I need,&quot; she said coldly, &quot;to leave immediately.&quot;

&quot;If you really need to, I&#39;ll help,&quot; Juri said, obviously confused by 
what had shaken the normally controlled young woman so badly. Then her 
eyes widened, and a little smile teased Juri&#39;s lips. &quot;She&#39;s the one, 
isn&#39;t she?&quot; Juri asked.

Integra opened her mouth to protest, then shut it, realizing there was 
no point. &quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted quietly, &quot;though I&#39;d prefer if you keep 
your voice down, please. Let&#39;s not let the whole bar know about it.&quot;

Then the decision was taken out of her hands. Integra saw Victoria get 
up from the bar, nodding to the twins behind the bar, then she began 
to walk to her table. Integra sat froizen, those red eyes growing 
closer and closer until she was standing there by the table.

&quot;Good evening, sir,&quot; Victoria said to her respectfully.

&quot;Victoria,&quot; Integra started to say, when Juri smoothly stood up. 
Integra&#39;s eyes silently pleaded with her, &#39;Don&#39;t go!&#39;

But Juri just smiled, &quot;You&#39;ll have to excuse me, but duty calls.&quot; She 
strode off, but as soon as Juri had a chance she looked backwards. 
Victoria had sat down by Integra, and they looked like they were 
talking.

The dark hared woman looked deeply uncomfortable, sipping at her 
drink. She was beautiful, but there was something odd about it. 
Something primal, almost animalistic seemed to hang about her, 
gorgeous but deadly.

&quot;Jun,&quot; her young friend smiled at her, &quot;would you please relax?&quot;

&quot;Kasumi,&quot; Jun was blushing, &quot;how did you learn about this place, 
anyway?&quot;

&quot;Why, your friend told be,&quot; Kasumi smiled cheerfully.

Jun looked around them wildly, and saw a blonde gazing at her 
steadily. A small smile tugged at her lips as she raised her glass in 
a toast.

&quot;Asuka,&quot; Jun whispered, blushing brightly.

Saya kept to the shadows, watching the crowd silently. &quot;Can I get you 
anything?&quot; Hyatt asked, before flopping over backwards.

Saya actually sweatdropped, but noticed that the girl was still 
looking up at her attentatively. &quot;Some Japanese O+ please,&quot; she 
managed.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Hyatt said weakly, and slithered along the floor to the bar.

Saya shook her head. She hunted vampires, but occasionally the people 
she encountered here were even stranger. Not that she minded...
