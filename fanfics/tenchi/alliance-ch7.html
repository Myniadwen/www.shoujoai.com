<h1>Alliance (part 7 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rann.html">Rann Aridorn</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/alliance-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;That is to say,&quot; Misaki chirped brightly to Washu and Ryoko, when 
they had gathered in the throne room. &quot;Emperor Azusa has asked that we 
return to Jurai as soon as possible, and has requested that you, Queen 
Washu, and you too, Princess Ryoko, join us so that we may continue 
planning for Ryoko and Ayeka&#39;s wedding.&quot;

&quot;And be in safety at the heart of his Empire, no less,&quot; Washu murmured 
with a small smile. The expression faded to a somewhat grimmer one as 
she tapped her fingers in a sharp staccato rythm on the arm of her 
throne.

&quot;However, the recent attempt at a coup is an obvious reason for me to 
NOT leave the system. In this time of unrest, how can I effectively 
comfort and govern my people if I&#39;m in an entirely different quadrant 
of the galaxy?&quot;

&quot;Emperor Azusa, of course, has already seen this point.&quot; Misaki was 
barely restraining her excitement at returning to Jurai, but she 
seemed to be making some attempt at Funaho&#39;s more composed bearing. 
&quot;As such, he has offered you however many knights and soldiers you 
might care to utilize, as well as any number of ships from the fleet, 
in order to assist you in keeping peace in the Hyurodan Alliance.&quot; The 
regal demeanor lasted another few seconds, before Misaki clasped her 
hands together, eyes turning large and glistening. &quot;Oh pleeeeeeeeease 
won&#39;t you come home with us?! The palace is ever so nice, and there 
will be feasts in your honor -every- -day-!&quot;

Both of the Hyurodan developed large sweatdrops at Misaki&#39;s tone, more 
reminiscient of a small child begging to be allowed to keep the pet 
that had supposedly followed them home than that of an Empress 
negotiating matters of state.

&quot;Ah, well, it&#39;s a generous offer, Empress Misaki. Give me some time to 
discuss it with my daughter, and I&#39;ll have an answer for you in a few 
hours.&quot;

&quot;Of course. ... Please say yes!&quot; And, with a little bow, Misaki 
hurried from the room, likely to tell the rest of her family that they 
were taking the Hyurodan royal family back to Jurai.

&quot;Oh, c&#39;mon, like we&#39;re NOT gonna take this opportunity?!&quot; Ryoko cried 
as soon as the doors had closed behind the Juraian Empress. &quot;It&#39;s a 
chance to finally get out of the sticks and back to real civilization! 
We used to at least get to go to some good space station bazaars back 
when we were pirates, but for the last two centuries we&#39;ve barely even 
left this PLANET!&quot;

&quot;Ryoko, there are other factors to take into consideration,&quot; Washu 
replied, seeming calm.

&quot;Consider the SHOPPING!&quot; the cyan-haired woman whined, lifting into 
the air and curling her legs up, hands clasped together, floating 
around in front of her mother. &quot;Consider the Universe Mall in First 
City! Consider the Last Ditch Effort in the grey sector, where you can 
buy a drink that&#39;s illegal EVERYWHERE!&quot; She pointed off in some random 
direction and flailed her hand, somehow conveying that she was 
pointing towards Jurai. &quot;Consider the Perky and Trim, finest nude 
resort in the galaxy, where every last person is judged on strict 
attractiveness parameters before even being allowed within a one mile 
radius of the place!&quot;

&quot;What makes you think you&#39;d get in?&quot; Washu murmured, cheek in hand, 
seeming vastly amused.

Ryoko went red in the face. &quot;MOTHER!&quot;

&quot;Before you start ranting, consider what my detractors would make of 
my shipping out of the system and allowing a couple of legions of 
Juraian troops come sweeping in like an occupying force.&quot;

That cut off any further outbursts, and Ryoko quietly lowered down to 
sit on the floor, elbow propped on her knee and chin in hand, 
expression suspiciously close to a pout. &quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot;

Washu leaned forward on the throne, gently stroking a small hand 
through the long blue-green spikes of her daughter&#39;s hair. &quot;There 
there. Don&#39;t lose all hope just yet, Ryoko. We just need to think this 
through a little more first.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;It will be good to be home,&quot; Ayeka acknowledged with a tired smile as 
Misaki took her daughter&#39;s hand. The older Juraian had seated herself 
beside the younger&#39;s bed to regale her with the good news.

&quot;And when we get there, it will be time to begin your training!&quot; 
Misaki added, eyes sparkling with a bright inner shine of pride.
Ayeka blinked several times in confusion. &quot;Training?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, dear. Oh my, that&#39;s right, it&#39;s a rather private thing and 
not generally known.&quot; Moving from the chair to sit on the side of the 
bed itself, Misaki cupped Ayeka&#39;s hand in both hers and rested it in 
her lap. &quot;Either upon marriage to a member of royalty or upon 
ascension of their power, Juraian women are trained in the use of 
energy swords and unarmed combat.&quot;

&quot;You mean...&quot; Ayeka&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;I am to learn to fight as you and 
Funaho do?&quot;

Misaki giggled, releasing her daughter&#39;s hand to reach inside her 
sleeve and retrieve her weapon. &quot;You used to love to watch Funaho and 
I spar, Ayeka-chan. Then one day you declared it was unladylike and 
stopped coming to watch.&quot;

Ayeka&#39;s pale cheeks flushed, and she looked away, embarrassed. &quot;I... I 
was embarrassed by the way I was always in awe of you both. I felt 
like a silly, gawking child.&quot;

&quot;You were a silly, gawking child,&quot; Misaki snickered, drawing an 
annoyed look. She poked Ayeka on the nose. &quot;That&#39;s what childhood is 
for, Ayeka-chan... being silly and gawking at what impresses you. And 
now you&#39;ll have a chance to do what so impressed you all those long 
years ago.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to help with that, if I can.&quot;

Both Juraians blinked in surprise and turned their heads to see Ryoko 
leaning in the doorframe, smirking a bit. Seeing she had their 
attention, she pushed off and sauntered on over to the side of the 
bed. &quot;After all, if I let little miss proper here to try and learn how 
to fight without me, she&#39;ll wind up refusing to fight with anyone not 
in formal dress.&quot;

Ayeka scowled up at Ryoko, and Misaki quickly excused herself, looking 
as if she were valiantly trying to suppress giggles, and thoughtfully 
closing the door after her.

&quot;Just how long were you standing there?!&quot; Ayeka demanded.

&quot;Eh, a little while.&quot; Ryoko chuckled, then slipped forward onto the 
bed, startling the other princess. 

But much to Ayeka&#39;s surprise, the cyan-haired woman didn&#39;t begin to 
grope her at all, but instead simply lay down close to her side and 
draped an arm across the middle. Ayeka&#39;s entire body tensed up, before 
she slowly allowed herself to relax, turning her head to the side, 
finding that her face was close to Ryoko&#39;s, but the perfect distance 
that she could see the other woman&#39;s face. Right now, the Hyurodan 
princess was smiling softly, amber eyes twinkling, and Ayeka thought 
it an expression much preferable to the leer Ryoko often turned in her 
direction.

&quot;You doin&#39; okay?&quot; Ryoko whispered, almost startling Ayeka again with 
the softness and sincerity of her tone.

&quot;Yes... I&#39;m well,&quot; Ayeka murmured back, smiling a little. &quot;I suppose, 
if pressed, I must admit I owe that, at least in part, to you.&quot;

&quot;In part?&quot; Ryoko snorted quietly, one corner of her mouth turning a 
bit further upward, making her smile lopsided. &quot;You just don&#39;t quit, 
do you?&quot;

&quot;Nor do you,&quot; the other girl returned good-naturedly, her own smile 
growing slightly. &quot;I don&#39;t see any reason why I should be the first.&quot;

&quot;I absolutely cannot stand you,&quot; came the soft reply, Ryoko&#39;s 
expression becoming almost thoughtful as she raised a hand to stroke 
it gently over Ayeka&#39;s hair just along her bangs and over her ear. 
&quot;You drive me crazy.&quot;

&quot;And you drive me crazy as well,&quot; Ayeka whispered, the look in her 
eyes showing just how she meant it.

Ryoko smiled again, a tender expression that touched her eyes and sent 
an amazing warmth through them. She leaned forward slowly, eyelids 
sinking halfway down, lips drawing closer to Ayeka&#39;s, the Juraian girl 
taking in a long, deep breath, but not moving away.

&quot;Ayeka,&quot; Ryoko murmured, voice low and throaty, fairly radiating 
sensuality in the manner that desert sands radiate heat.

&quot;Yes... Ryoko?&quot; Ayeka breathed, letting her eyes start to sink closed.

&quot;... Y&#39;wanna screw?&quot;

Ayeka&#39;s eyes flew open in horror, and in less than a second her hand 
blurred out, palm and fingers striking Ryoko&#39;s cheek with a loud sound 
that could have almost have had large, animated letters spelling out 
SLAP! rising from it, the impact actually lifting Ryoko off the bed 
and spinning her through the air before thudding out of sight on the 
floor.

&quot;God DAMN, girl, you hit pretty fucking hard for an invalid!&quot; Ryoko 
grumbled as she rose to her feet, rubbing her cheek. &quot;What the hell&#39;s 
the matter with you?!&quot;

&quot;How dare you say that to me?!&quot; Ayeka shouted, sitting up and 
gathering the sheets around herself as if they were protection from 
the other woman&#39;s lechery. &quot;Though I should have expected it from 
someone like you!&quot;

&quot;Hey, a minute ago you were about to kiss &#39;someone like me&#39;!&quot; Ryoko 
yelled back, leaning forward and pointing at her face as if for 
emphasis, where a large dark mark in the shape of a hand was already 
starting to form on her cheek. &quot;Well, ha! For your information, I was 
just messin&#39; with you!&quot;

&quot;Of course you were! As if a creature like you could have any idea of 
how to be romantic!&quot; With a huff, Ayeka rolled onto her side with her 
back to Ryoko and pulled the sheet up over her head to indicate that 
the argument was at an end.

Ryoko stood there for a few moments, stung, before withdrawing from 
the room without further taunt and closing the door after her. Slowly, 
she turned and walked down the hall, out onto the balcony where she 
had, weeks ago, advised Ayeka on not catching cold standing out in the 
night air in her sleeping kimono.

The Hyurodan princess rested her hands on the cool stone of the 
balcony&#39;s rail, closing her eyes and tilting her head back as she took 
in a long breath, feeling the faintly moist cold of the night air 
tingle as it rushed into lungs powerful enough to sustain her in the 
vacuum of space. Then she let out the breath in one long rush as she 
allowed her head to hang.

&#39;Well. I fucked that one right up. Way to go, Ryoko.&#39;

What had she been thinking, saying that? Treating Ayeka as if she were 
one of the guards being propositioned for a quick bout of fun in a 
hallway alcove, not a Juraian princess and her fiancee. Then covering 
her mistake by denying anything worthwhile she HAD said.

&quot;The young often make mistakes. It&#39;s called &#39;experience&#39;.&quot;

Starting at the seeming answer to her private thought, Ryoko turned to 
see Funaho standing in the archway. The mature Juraian was wearing one 
of her typical kimonos of earthen colors, cream rimmed in dark brown, 
but it was left open in front, perhaps under doctor&#39;s orders, leaving 
her slender neck and the middle of her collarbone bare, draping over 
the fullness of her breasts, and showing her midriff, completely 
covered in shimmering bands of silver, down to where the kimono was 
lightly gathered to close at the waist. She was resting a hand against 
the stone of the archway, hair loose and falling down around her face 
and over her shoulders, dark eyes catching some of the light from the 
planet&#39;s moon even from where she stood in the shadows.

Momentarily mesmerized, Ryoko realized she was staring after a few 
moments and turned her gaze back to the desert horizon. &quot;Good to see 
you&#39;re up and about, Empress,&quot; she murmured, trying to avoid answering 
the comment.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Her voice certainly seemed strong and healthy, and her 
step was sure and unwavering as she moved to stand beside the Hyurodan 
princess, resting her own delicate-seeming hands on the railing, 
gazing up at the clear, dark sky and the little jewels of the stars. 
After waiting what she apparently felt was a suitable amount of time, 
the Empress turned her gaze to Ryoko. &quot;I will assume from its tone and 
your manner that this is not one of your and Ayeka&#39;s usual tiffs...?&quot;

Ryoko heaved a sigh, resisting the desire to turn and look at her 
fiancee&#39;s co-parent, because she&#39;d probably wind up breaking down 
crying and confiding every last secret she had like some lovestruck 
little girl bawling about a fight with her girlfriend. &quot;Yeah, this one 
was for real, I guess,&quot; she allowed in a reluctant tone after a 
moment.

&quot;Might I ask what set it off...?&quot;

&quot;I chose a REALLY bad moment to make a stupid comment,&quot; Ryoko 
murmured, looking down. She knew that Ayeka wouldn&#39;t exactly care to 
have the details surrounding that &#39;bad moment&#39; spread about, at least. 
&quot;Basically... I guess I didn&#39;t treat her like a princess.&quot;

&quot;I might remind you that you have never treated Ayeka as if she were a 
princess,&quot; Funaho said with amusement coloring her tone, eyes dancing 
as she turned a smile on Ryoko. &quot;You have always treated her more like 
a playmate in the sandbox.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, what I said&#39;d make her stop playing with me, if that were 
true,&quot; Ryoko sighed, shaking her head.

&quot;I know that she will forgive you, given time.&quot;

&quot;What makes you so sure?&quot; Ryoko demanded mildly, finally turning to 
look at the other woman.

Whatever answer may have been impending was disrupted by a loud crash 
in the hallway. Both of them whirled around, then relaxed into 
bemusement as they watched Mihoshi attempt to balance several vases 
she had apparently knocked from their stands and caught before they 
smashed to the ground... for all of ten seconds. Then the one in the 
middle dropped out from between the other two, leaving Mihoshi&#39;s tight 
hold on them to smash both pieces of pottery together as the first 
smashed spectacularly on the ground. Unaware that she was being 
observed, Mihoshi quickly and lamely used a foot to push some of the 
mess behind a column before making a run for it.

&quot;Why do you put up with her?&quot; Ryoko chuckled, turning back around to 
resume her earlier pose, though now with a lighter heart.

Funaho finished laughing softly, and her amusement turned to a softer 
happiness as she answered. &quot;Mihoshi is excellent at her job, despite 
appearances to the contrary. Where it comes to her true duties, she 
never falters or missteps, and it is rare that I find so much as a 
hair out of place in Sasami&#39;s pigtails when Mihoshi has tended to her. 
Besides which... if there is anyone alive that loves Sasami as much as 
I, Misaki, Azusa, or Ayeka... it is Mihoshi. That woman&#39;s world 
revolves around my daughter, and she would see it as absolutely 
nothing to give her life for Sasami&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;I guess help like that&#39;s hard to come by,&quot; Ryoko murmured, unable to 
keep the fact that she was impressed out of her tone.

&quot;Indeed. And she also answers your question of how I am so sure that 
Ayeka will forgive you, Ryoko.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;s that?&quot; Ryoko turned puzzled eyes to Funaho, brow creasing in 
confusion.

Funaho tucked her hands inside her sleeves, seeming to consider before 
speaking. &quot;I am Ayeka&#39;s parent, but that does not mean I am blind to 
her shortcomings. And one of those is too much of a focus on propriety 
and what she considers proper behavior for royalty. As you might 
guess, Mihoshi infuriates her on a regular basis.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I kinda figured. So?&quot;

&quot;So... despite the fact that Mihoshi manages to anger Ayeka to the 
point that Ayeka can hardly speak on the average of once a day, she 
has never once, in all the years that Mihoshi has been her sister&#39;s 
attendant, made any motion to attempt to have her dismissed.&quot;

Ryoko blinked, not sure she was following.

&quot;Certainly, she has threatened Mihoshi with it, at least -twice- 
daily, but never has she come to myself, or her father, or her mother 
and tried to make us fire the girl.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I give up... how&#39;s that tell me Ayeka will forgive me?&quot;

Funaho laughed very softly, taking her gaze from the stars and turning 
it towards the door to her chambers, slowly moving away. Just as she 
was about to move into the shadows beyond the archway, she paused and 
looked over her shoulder, eyes dancing through a curtain of her dark 
hair.

&quot;Because, Ryoko... Ayeka does not let anger keep her from forgiving 
the people she cares about.&quot;

And with that, the Empress of the Jurai left to go to bed, leaving a 
very shocked Princess of the Hyurodan behind her.

------------------------------------------------------------

The sound of metal smashing rock was strange... discordant and tonal 
at the same time, like a gong shattering when struck. Kallista made a 
small sound in her throat... she wasn&#39;t unfamiliar with the sound, but 
it didn&#39;t make it any less grating. Especially when she considered the 
reason for it.

She angled herself around and down to land lightly, kicking up a bit 
of sand as she allowed her gem-powered flight field to disappear, then 
rested her hands on her hips, simply watching Riyata in silence for 
several minutes. The large, black-haired Hyurodan guard had discarded 
her armored top, and was unclad save for her loincloth and boots, bare 
breasts and stomach shining with sweat in the starlight, save for dark 
patches where rock dust and sand had mixed to form a thick paste over 
the fluid movement of the guardswoman&#39;s muscles.

&quot;Better be careful,&quot; Kallista spoke up, running a hand along her 
orange shark-fin of hair. &quot;You let that stuff set up, it&#39;ll be just 
like concrete.&quot;

Riyata&#39;s back was to the other woman, and Kallista watched her slow 
and stop, letting her body slump forward a bit, golden spear held 
loosely in her hands, arms at a drooping angle more reminiscient of a 
savage about to lash out with a club. After a few moments of silence, 
there was the sound of a few sharply-inhaled breaths... Kallista could 
practically see her friend&#39;s nostrils flaring.

&quot;... The green-haired one?&quot; Riyata slowly straightened up, not turning 
around and instead knocking a few rock shards aside with the toe of 
her boot, seeming to ponder which boulder to smash next.

&quot;Yeah... fell asleep on me a little while back.&quot; Kallista floated 
around to be more at Riyata&#39;s side, where she could at least partially 
see the other woman&#39;s face, which was a mask of impassiveness. &quot;I&#39;m 
surprised you can smell me over you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been frustrated lately,&quot; Riyata answered, tone conversational 
but lacking any inflection, either positive or negative. Apparently 
having decided, she brought the spear up in a twirl over her head, 
shifting her grip to a downward stab to bring the point down on a 
waist-high boulder, causing a miniature explosion as the metal struck 
other veins in the rock, sparks blasting out from the point of impact 
as the stone turned to so much shrapnel.

Kallista shrugged, apparently unfazed by her friend&#39;s exercise. &quot;Ryoko 
hasn&#39;t been interested in sex since the Juraians got here. Not with 
me, anyway.&quot;

&quot;Almost twenty years, now,&quot; the black-haired woman observed, again 
without inflection, kicking a few shards of rock hard enough that they 
went flying and struck a nearby cliff face, striking up more sparks. 
&quot;That about right?&quot;

&quot;Twenty-three,&quot; Kallista corrected, her own tone hard to decipher.

&quot;You haven&#39;t been with anyone else but her in at least nineteen, 
though.&quot;

&quot;What of it?&quot; The orange-haired woman was feeling defensive now, her 
eyes narrowed, the seafoam green color darkening slightly.

&quot;Does she know that?&quot; Riyata kicked a rock the size of her head into 
the air, then swung her spear like a club, the shaft impacting and 
shattering the stone into a shower of gravel.

&quot;Probably not. No reason for her to ask, really. Why&#39;s it matter?&quot;

Riyata slowly turned her head, orange eyes tinged red with her 
exertion and the emotions that had been warring within her since she 
had watched Ada cut down in front of her by the traitorous Kuska. &quot;Are 
you ever going to tell Ryoko that you&#39;re in love with her?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Kallista snapped, her own eyes flashing with a bit of red. &quot;And 
you&#39;re not going to either!&quot;

&quot;Lost opportunities,&quot; Riyata murmured, reaching under her thick black 
mane to run her fingertips over the angular little nub of the second 
power gem where it was sunk into the back of her neck.

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that... this isn&#39;t some story of tragedy for me, 
Riyata! So what if I&#39;m in love with Ryoko? I&#39;ll get over it, and she 
won&#39;t die anyway!&quot; Her anger fed on the hurt nevertheless, and before 
she could stop herself, she blurted, &quot;We&#39;re not you and Ada!&quot;

If she could have gone back in time and slain herself before she&#39;d 
said the words, she would have. Kallista had known Riyata for over a 
thousand years, more than half their lives. They&#39;d gone to school 
together, served in the war together. They&#39;d shared tragedy, blood, 
joy, beds, and lovers. And Kallista was perhaps the only other person 
alive who knew just how deeply Riyata had been in love with a 
short-haired little rookie guard that had clung to the older woman 
when the other guards teased her.

&quot;God... God, Riyata, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; whispered Kallista, watching the 
other woman&#39;s grip on her weapon go white-knuckled. She felt hot, wet 
pressure around her eyes, wanting to break down crying at the hell she 
realized she&#39;d just put her best friend through. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I 
didn&#39;t mean-&quot;

She choked off the rest of her apology as Riyata&#39;s spear flew in a 
flash of gold, slamming into the cliff wall, burying almost half its 
length in the stone. Without a word, Riyata strode slowly forward, 
deceptively calm as she apparently moved to retrieve her weapon. But 
instead, a fist blurred out at waist-height, fingers turned upward, 
slamming into the stone and sending dust and chips of rock dancing 
down.

Kallista watched with wide eyes as Riyata&#39;s fists slammed into the 
solid rock again and again, each time leaving slightly deeper impact 
craters. The black-haired Hyurodan was stronger than any other being 
Kallista had ever met, and could probably have bent her spear double 
without much difficulty if she&#39;d cared to. The fact that she was 
pummeling solid rock wasn&#39;t what was shocking. What was was the way 
Riyata was doing it... with a single-minded fury, a boiling rage. 
Kallista couldn&#39;t remember any time she&#39;d known the other woman when 
she&#39;d felt so much hate boiling off of her, and somehow knew it wasn&#39;t 
because of the careless comment. This was fury born of frustration and 
grief.

&quot;Riyata,&quot; Kallista called as the blows speeded up, became hectic and 
wild. &quot;Riyata!&quot; She lept down from the rock and rushed over, shouting. 
&quot;Riyata, dammit, stop, you&#39;re going to hurt yourself!&quot; She scowled 
with a mixture of worry and dread. &quot;Goddammit, stop, before you cut 
yourself! You know what&#39;ll happen if some of your blood gets in your 
mouth!&quot;

Kallista called her friend&#39;s name once more, and when that went 
unheeded, lept forward in a tackle, wrapping her arms under Riyata&#39;s 
and yanking her back from the cliff face, trying to wrest the 
struggling guard to the ground. Riyata was stronger, but Kallista had 
put more practice into the finer points of fighting, and managed to 
get the other woman on her back, pinning her wrists.

&quot;Stop it!&quot;

&quot;I CAN&#39;T!&quot; Riyata snapped, then shuddered, going limp beneath her 
friend, every ragged breath pressing her bare breasts to the metal 
covering Kallista&#39;s. &quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; she repeated, voice ragged. &quot;It&#39;s 
either anger or... I can&#39;t deal with it... I can&#39;t let myself...&quot;

She went quiet, her words turning into soft sobs. Kallista quickly 
released her grip and instead wrapped her arms around the other woman, 
pulling her close, pressing her head against her shoulder and stroking 
her hand over the thick black spikes of Riyata&#39;s hair.

&quot;I miss her so much,&quot; Riyata wailed, clutching to her friend as if she 
were drowning.

&quot;I know, honey,&quot; Kallista murmured, letting the tears slide down her 
own cheeks, closing her eyes and rocking her friend gently. &quot;I know.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Enter,&quot; Funaho called at the light rap on her door.

&quot;Good evening, Funaho,&quot; Washu said brightly as she slipped in and 
closed the door after her, eyes running up and down the attractive 
Juraian woman where she sat in front of the room&#39;s vanity brushing her 
hair. &quot;I expected Misaki to be bustling about like a mother hen.&quot;

&quot;Misaki went in search of the kitchen.&quot; A gentle smile settled on 
Funaho&#39;s lips, amusement coloring her tone as she clarified, &quot;She 
believes herself utterly unable to sleep unless she gets milk and a 
cookie first.&quot;

Washu chuckled, shaking her head as she walked over to stand behind 
Funaho, holding her hand out in a request. With a light nod, the 
Juraian empress lay the brush in the Hyurodan queen&#39;s palm, then 
rested her hands in her lap as the pink-haired woman took over 
brushing duty.

&quot;Would you mind if I asked you a rather personal question?&quot; Washu said 
quietly after several minutes, meeting Funaho&#39;s gaze in the mirror&#39;s 
reflection.

&quot;You&#39;ve had your hands in my insides, Washu. I should think that 
anything after that would be minor,&quot; Funaho replied cheerfully, dark 
eyes dancing.

&quot;I suppose so. I notice that you seem to enjoy spending time with the 
young princesses very much... how is it you don&#39;t have a child of your 
own?&quot;

The dancing light in Funaho&#39;s eyes went out, her gaze turning flat, 
the smile disappearing into a cool expression. &quot;Before Ayeka was born, 
I was pregnant with the Emperor&#39;s first child. But complications 
developed, and I lost the baby.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m deeply sorry,&quot; Washu murmured, her own gaze turning soft and sad, 
hands still running the brush through Funaho&#39;s long chestnut tresses. 
They both sat in silence for several minutes more, before Washu 
continued, &quot;Surely, though, Juraian medical science could have healed 
you of any injuries from the miscarriage... I have several techniques 
I could use, if they can&#39;t. You could try again...&quot;

&quot;Juraian medicine was quite capable of restoring me to fertility,&quot; 
Funaho sighed, closing her eyes briefly. &quot;But though it could have 
healed the scars on my womb,&quot; She lay a hand on her stomach, fingers 
twitching lightly at the feel of the cool metal bands of the healing 
cast wrapped around her abdomen. &quot;It could not heal the scars on my 
heart.&quot; The empress raised a hand, resting two fingers against the 
smooth skin between her breasts.

Washu leaned forward to set the brush on the vanity counter, then 
draped her arms around Funaho&#39;s shoulders, resting her chin on one 
shoulder to look closely at the other woman&#39;s reflection.

&quot;Sometimes a scar can heal without even being noticed.&quot; She grinned 
softly, then nudged her cheek against Funaho&#39;s. &quot;Can I see a smile, so 
*I* can sleep?&quot;

Funaho laughed softly, smiling, happiness returning to her eyes. She 
raised a hand to gently touch Washu&#39;s cheek. &quot;Goodnight, my friend.&quot;

&quot;Goodnight, Funaho.&quot; Washu gave the other woman a light squeeze, then 
drew away. &quot;Sleep well, and make sure Misaki doesn&#39;t get cookie crumbs 
in the bed.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Stars slid slowly along the planes of the window dome, casting tiny 
points of light on the black robes of the woman slipping into the 
room, shoulders hunched nervously. Her long, shining white hair fell 
in two long sections, several long spikes almost brushing the floor, 
her pretty face showing barely-contained fear, the fright dancing in 
her pink eyes. Perhaps even more noticable, on her pale white skin, 
was the midnight black mark of a tattoo on her right cheek, a single 
black slash.

&quot;Ah... I have a report...?&quot; she murmured, wincing as if expecting to 
be immediately struck down for her audacity.

&quot;Speak, One,&quot; came the low, rich voice, which seemed nothing if not 
amused at the servant&#39;s timidity.

One nodded rapidly, speaking quickly, trying to be given permission to 
depart as soon as possible. &quot;The rebellion was easily crushed as you 
predicted. There also seems to be no inkling that you were the guiding 
force behind this uprising, and it has merely been written off as the 
machinations of the currently displeased political factions. And...&quot; 
She slipped a computer pad out of her sleeve, inching over to the 
domed console at which her owner stood, gingerly setting the pad down 
on the flat control panel, before darting back as if trying to stay 
out of easy striking range. &quot;This exchange between Emperor Azusa and 
Empress Misaki was intercepted and recorded. The Juraians are going 
home, and have invited Washu and Ryoko along with them.&quot;

&quot;Ryoko,&quot; the tall figure standing at the console murmured, rolling the 
name around and letting the sound of it fill the room. Then long, deft 
fingers danced over the pad&#39;s controls, listening to the Empress 
Misaki&#39;s piping voice alternately blur into almost nonsensical speeds 
in excitement and break down crying, to end sounding utterly cheery. 
&quot;Excellent. You&#39;ve done well, One. Retire for the evening.&quot;

Seeming massively relieved, One nodded and bowed her way out of the 
room, waiting until the door of the observation deck had closed behind 
her to break into a mixed frightened and relieved run.

The tall figure moved to gaze out the viewing port, starlight moving 
slowly over cyan hair and glittering in slit-pupiled amber eyes.

&quot;Ryoko... we must see one another soon.&quot;
