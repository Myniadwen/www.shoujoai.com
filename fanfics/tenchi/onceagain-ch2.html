<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 2 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/onceagain-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The stone steps were covered by sakura blossoms as she walked up, 
lugging a battered old suitcase behind her. A hat concealed part of her 
face, violet hair blowing in the wind as her simple red dress swirled 
around her legs. Finally reaching the top of the steps she looked at the 
building, taking her hat off to reveal a dusky skinned young woman, 
shading her eyes with her hand.

Himemiya Anthy smiled slightly, &quot;Looks like I&#39;m here.&quot; With that she 
picked up her suitcase and continued on, walking up to the building and 
going inside.

Not too long after Anthy found herself sitting in the manager&#39;s rooms, 
the dark haired woman pouring them both tea. &quot;Miss Himemiya,&quot; Kanako 
Urashima said gravely, &quot;I have to admit, I wasn&#39;t expecting such a quick 
response to our notice that rooms were for rent.&quot;

&quot;Anthy, please,&quot; she smiled back. Anthy drank her tea with a unconscious 
sort of grace, &quot;I hope I didn&#39;t inconvenience you by arriving so soon?&quot;

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Kanako answered, &quot;we have a room ready now, and several 
more opening soon.&quot; She studied Anthy shrewdly, &quot;As a graduate I was 
surprised that you wanted to move into a dorm full of university 
students.&quot;

&quot;I only recently graduated,&quot; Anthy had a slightly quirky smile on her 
face, &quot;and find myself more comfortable in this sort of environment.&quot; 
She looked off in the distance, &quot;And this place is convenient for 
something I&#39;m doing, as well.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Kanako looked politely curious.

&quot;I&#39;m looking for a missing person, have been for the past two years,&quot; 
Anthy said, a faintly pained look on her pretty face.

&quot;A relative?&quot; Kanako asked politely.

&quot;No,&quot; Anthy shook her head, &quot;but she is someone that I care for... very 
much.&quot;

&#39;Interesting,&#39; Kanako noted, drinking her tea calmly. &quot;Not to be rude,&quot; 
she finally said, &quot;but do you have means of support?&quot;

Anthy smiled faintly as she answered promptly, &quot;I have funds saved, as 
well as a job that supports me fairly well.&quot;

Kanako nodded, even as she silently wondered why she was hesitating. 
There was something that was just slightly off about Anthy, but she 
couldn&#39;t put her finger on it. &quot;All right,&quot; she finally made her 
decision, &quot;welcome to the Hinata Dorm, Anthy.&quot;

&quot;About time,&quot; Kuro muttered, the little black cat sitting up by the 
window.

&quot;Ventriloquism?&quot; Anthy blinked, looking at Kanako then to the cat.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Kanako agreed gravely as they both got up and 
headed out of the room. She nodded towards the roof as she continued on 
wryly, &quot;You&#39;ll be taking the room just above this one, actually.&quot;

&quot;I noticed the repair to the roof,&quot; Anthy commented as they headed to 
the front hall where her suitcase waited, &quot;was there a hole originally?&quot;

&quot;The previous manager had personal reasons for not repairing it,&quot; Kanako 
shrugged.

&quot;I...&quot; Anthy started when something zipped by at eye level.

&quot;Nya!&quot; the turtle exclaimed as it flew along, little fins flapping 
madly.

&quot;Was that...?&quot; Anthy blinked at Kanako, who just nodded.

&quot;Come back so I can make soup out of you!&quot; the brown skinned girl 
skidded around the corner then ran right by them.

&quot;Su!&quot; Kanako barked, &quot;No running in the halls!&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Su looked sheepish, scratching her slightly messy mop of blonde 
hair, the teen&#39;s t-shirt and shorts looking comfortable and lived in.

&quot;This is Koalla Su,&quot; Kanako preformed the introductions, &quot;meet Himemiya 
Anthy, the first of our hopefully many new residents.&quot;

Anthy half bowed to the energetic young woman, &quot;How do you do?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet cha&#39;,&quot; Su grinned back, eyes twinkling as she looked 
Anthy over.

Anthy had to ask, &quot;You really aren&#39;t going to try to eat that turtle?&quot;

&quot;Only if I catch it,&quot; and with a wave Su was off.

&quot;Don&#39;t be too concerned,&quot; Kanako said soothingly as they picked up 
Anthy&#39;s suitcase and then walked to the stairs, &quot;Su&#39;s caught Tama-chan 
more than once, and hasn&#39;t eaten her.&quot;

&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; Anthy smiled.

After taking her to her door Kanako handed her a small booklet and 
explained, &quot;This has breakfast and dinner times and other information 
you need, as well as how cooking and cleaning duties tend to be divided 
up.&quot;

&quot;Can I trade doing the cleaning for my cooking responsibilities?&quot; Anthy 
asked as she took the book from her.

&quot;Probably,&quot; Kanako agreed, &quot;I take it you&#39;re not a good cook?&quot;

&quot;I can make a great shaved ice,&quot; Anthy said to her honestly, &quot;and my 
attempts at curry tend to be rather dangerous.&quot;

Kanako nodded slightly, &quot;Understood.&quot; Gravely she continued, &quot;I&#39;ll look 
forward to seeing you at dinner, Anthy.&quot; With that she turned and left 
Anthy to her unpacking.

Anthy emptied her suitcase into a dresser and hung up clothes in just a 
few minutes, and then she sat down with a tired sigh before flopping 
onto her back. Looking up at the ceiling a gentle, soothing breeze 
washed over her, the sent of cherry blossoms in the air, and a 
surprising sense of peace lingered around this place.

&quot;Utena...&quot; Anthy murmured.

For an age Anthy had been bound to Ohtori academy and her brother, 
trapped in a endless cycle of duels and hope only to be crushed again 
and again. Utena had changed all that, taking up her sword and fighting 
in the duels not for the prize, but instead to protect Anthy and those 
she cared for. In the final test she had won... then left without a 
word, disappearing without a trace.

Anthy got up, smiling to herself sadly as she walked to the window. 
There was so much left unsaid between her and Utena, so much she 
regretted... if nothing else she wanted to find Utena to say she was 
sorry. Sadly, it hadn&#39;t been that easy. Utena, in defeating Akio had 
claimed the prize, the power to revolutionize the world, and it made her 
incredibly elusive to Anthy&#39;s limited gifts, hiding for the last year or 
so...

&quot;Yo,&quot; a unfamiliar voice called out. Looking down from the second floor 
Anthy saw a sandy haired blonde looking up at her curiously. The young 
woman waved hello, &quot;So you&#39;re moving into Naru&#39;s old room?&quot;

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Anthy called back before remembering to introduce 
herself.

&quot;Mitsune Konno,&quot; she smiled back charmingly, &quot;though my friends call me 
Kitsune.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Anthy smiled. She looked at the woman curiously, 
guessing she was also past school age, &quot;Are you a resident, too?&quot;

&quot;Actually I run the Hinata Cafe next door,&quot; Kitsune said, &quot;though I used 
to live here. Stop on by, we&#39;ve got good eats.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Anthy was surprised to realize she meant it.

&quot;Not to mention I like to slip over here and use the hot springs,&quot; 
Kitsune added impishly.

A tall, black haired woman strode up, her manner regal and oddly 
carrying a katana. &quot;Kitsune, I was waiting for...&quot; she started only to 
look up and see the woman there.&#148;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt,&quot; she 
bowed slightly.

&quot;Motoko Aoyama,&quot; Kitsune performed the introductions, &quot;I&#39;d like you to 
meet our newest resident, Himemiya Anthy.&quot;

Motoko nodded, her expression grave. &quot;Welcome,&quot; she said calmly.

&#39;If she was at Ohtori she&#39;d probably be wearing a rose signet,&#39; Anthy 
found herself thinking. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to have delayed your friend,&quot; she 
said honestly.

Motoko studied her thoughtfully for a moment then she offered, &quot;Would 
you care to join us at the hot springs?&quot;

Anthy fought back her usual hesitation and smiled, &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;

To be continued...

Notes: Anthy is from the series Revolutionary Girl Utena, as is the 
object of her quest Utena. This episode is set shortly before my series 
&quot;Echoes of a Final Duel&quot; and is part of the same continuity as 
&quot;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket&quot; and many of my other stories.</pre>
