<h1>Karaoke Night (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/overstreet.html">Clayton Overstreet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Mihoshi tugged on Kiyone&#39;s arm as they walked down the street. &quot;Come 
on Kiyone. We live at Tenchi&#39;s place now so we have a little extra 
money. We should enjoy it.&quot;

Kiyone shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t know Mihoshi. I mean I know it&#39;s fun 
and everything, but don&#39;t you think we should work on some case files 
or something?&quot;

Mihoshi stopped and looked Kiyone right in the eye. &quot;Don&#39;t you always 
say we&#39;re stuck in a backwater part of the universe? I mean we gave up 
the main office to live here. What have we got to loose?&quot;

Kiyone bit her lip. For the life of her she couldn&#39;t figure out why 
she had given up her promotion to come back here with Mihoshi.

Finally she sighed and let Mihoshi lead her into the karaoke bar. Once 
inside the booth though she cheered up considerably. Despite the fact 
that it seemed useless and silly Kiyone really enjoyed singing. They 
started off taking turns singing songs like &#39;Lonely Moon&#39; and 
&#39;Dimension of love&#39;. But their scores always got so low when they sang 
alone. Kiyone always was a little embarrassed about singing with 
Mihoshi, but once they got started she just seemed to zone out and go 
with it. It felt really good. And their scores together were on the 
wall of the bar as the best ever. But something about that creeped her 
out. She wasn&#39;t sure why, but being so happy while singing with 
Mihoshi made her feel... weird.

Kiyone and Mihoshi finished singing the last song of the night and she 
noticed her arm was linked with Mihoshi&#39;s. How did that happen? She 
quickly took her arm back and blushed. &quot;Can we sing one more together 
Kiyone?&quot; Mihoshi asked.

Kiyone actually considered it but not knowing why she had done it made 
her really nervous. &quot;No... No we&#39;ve been here too long already. I 
think we should go home.&quot;

Mihoshi pouted, but then she saw the look on Kiyone&#39;s face and yawned, 
&quot;I guess you&#39;re right Kiyone.&quot; She turned and walked out ahead of the 
green haired police officer. Kiyone was amazed. Usually Mihoshi would 
whine and beg until they spent every cent and were forcibly removed by 
the management. It was very unusual for her to just give up like this.

She suddenly realized that Mihoshi had left without her. She ran out 
and caught up with Mihoshi on the street outside. &quot;Hey Mihoshi are you 
feeling alright?&quot;

She looked back at Kiyone as if she was surprised she was still there. 
&quot;Why do you ask Kiyone?&quot;

Kiyone looked at her, &quot;Because you just left. Usually you get us 
dragged out.&quot;

Mihoshi smiled slightly. &quot;Well it was obvious you wanted to leave and 
it wouldn&#39;t have been any fun if you didn&#39;t want to do it so why not?&quot; 
Kiyone bit her lip as they walked thinking about what had happened in 
there. It wasn&#39;t the first time she had taken Mihoshi&#39;s hands while 
they sang. As they walked Mihoshi kept glancing at Kiyone out of the 
corner of her eye. She never could understand why her partner always 
got so upset about everything. Not just her of course, but she was the 
main one. It was always a wonder to her that when people liked 
something sometimes they felt guilty about it. She knew that if you 
did something wrong you felt bad, but if you have fun and nobody is 
hurt then what was the problem? And Kiyone seemed to feel that way 
about everything. Whenever they sang, ate good tasting food, or even 
just laying by the pool. Kiyone always found a way to feel bad about 
it. In fact Mihoshi was pretty sure that the main reason Kiyone yelled 
at her so much was because she had too much fun with her. Watching her 
do that to herself made Mihoshi feel like cheering her up whether she 
wanted to or not. Which was why she was always dragging Kiyone around.

When they got home Tenchi and Sasami greeted them. &quot;Hi, how was the 
bar tonight guys?&quot;

Kiyone blushed and mumbled something about it being alright, but 
Mihoshi shot forward. &quot;Oh it was so much fun. And Kiyone was so 
relaxed. I tell you Tenchi when we sing together she&#39;s like a whole 
different person.&quot; He looked at Kiyone who was busy looking anywhere 
else and blushing.

Tenchi took the hint and decided to end it, &quot;Well don&#39;t change too 
much Kiyone.&quot; He turned and sat down on the couch next to Ryoko. Since 
they had all returned Tenchi had been spending a lot more time with 
the former space pirate. Kiyone understood something about him 
promising to take a trip with her once he was finished with school.

Kiyone sat down in a chair and Mihoshi sat on the other end of the 
couch. &quot;Where is princess Aeka?&quot; Tenchi looked up and shrugged.

&quot;Last time I saw her she was fighting with Ryoko.&quot; He turned to the 
space pirate. &quot;Do you know where she is?&quot;

Ryoko&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Oops, I forgot!&quot; She teleported away and came 
back a few minutes later carrying a shivering Aeka.

Aeka turned and yelled at Ryoko, &quot;How could you just leave me up there 
you pirate?&quot; Ryoko tried to apologize but the princess just turned and 
walked away.

Tenchi looked at Ryoko suspiciously. She held up her hand. &quot;It&#39;s not 
like that Tenchi. She slapped me so I kind of grabbed her and put her 
on the top limb of a tree. I was going to get her down but we started 
watching the television and...&quot;

Tenchi just shook his head. &quot;Ryoko next time at least put her where 
she can get back safely alright?&quot; Ryoko nodded and smiled.

Aeka however had come back down the stairs. &quot;Lord Tenchi I can&#39;t 
believe that

you would allow her to do that to me. I am a princess after all and 
should not be treated like this.&quot;

Tenchi looked up at her. &quot;Then stop hitting her.&quot;

Aeka frowned more and snapped, &quot;Well then tell her to respect me. Ever 
since you started being so nice to her she keeps trying to make me 
jealous even more than usual.&quot;

Ryoko growled. &quot;That isn&#39;t true. I was talking to Ryo-oki about what I 
plan to do with Tenchi once I get him alone and you came around the 
corner screaming that it was totally inappropriate and that Tenchi 
wouldn&#39;t do anything like that with me.&quot;

Aeka&#39;s face turned red. &quot;it was inappropriate. The acts you were 
describing... it was disgusting. No member of the royal family would 
ever do anything like that. And your claim that that is where babies 
come from is just ridiculous. Everyone knows that babies are made in 
heaven and left in the limbs of a Juraian tree.&quot;

Everyone looked at her in shock. Then Ryoko began to snicker. Kiyone 
and Mihoshi let out tiny laughs and Sasami in the kitchen could be 
heard giggling. Aeka looked at everyone in shock and asked, &quot;What? 
What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Ryoko and the others couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore. 
While Tenchi stood there quietly blushing the others burst out 
laughing. Ryoko was rolling on the floor. &quot;She doesn&#39;t know! 
HAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHA.&quot;

Aeka gasped. &quot;No... no. Lord Tenchi is what Ryoko described actually 
how babies are made?&quot; Tenchi looked down at Ryoko. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;d 
have to know what she said.&quot; Ryoko grinned evilly and took her chance 
when she saw it and just as Tenchi realized what he&#39;d done. She jumped 
up and whispered into his ear. With every word his face turned a new 
shade of red and a drop of blood fell from his nose.

Aeka stood there and waited, &quot;Well?&quot; After what seemed like ten 
minutes Ryoko backed off. She had added a few things while she had him 
but had also made sure that what the princess had head was there. 
Tenchi managed to stutter for a minute and said, &quot;Well...well most of 
it yeah... some of it I guess isn&#39;t strictly required but...&quot;

Mihoshi and Kiyone ran up the stairs before they heard Aeka&#39;s scream 
of disgust. Mihoshi dived into her bed while Kiyone slammed the door 
against the string of curses and sounds of pure hatred coming from 
downstairs. Kiyone sighed and lay down on

the bed. Then she looked at Mihoshi who looked back and they both 
started laughing again. Mihoshi got up and opened the door for a 
second. &quot;... and further more I think that the very idea of doing 
something so vile is just...&quot;

She closed it again and looked back at Kiyone. &quot;Well it looks like 
they&#39;ll be at it for a while. I guess we&#39;ll just have to find 
something to talk about since it&#39;s too early to go to bed.&quot; Kiyone 
raised an eyebrow and asked her, &quot;And since when has that ever stopped 
you?&quot;

Mihoshi blushed and sat down on her bed. &quot;There is nothing wrong with 
taking a nice nap in the sun.&quot;

Kiyone looked at her and said, &quot;There is when we could be getting some 
work done.&quot; Mihoshi rolled her eyes. &quot;Is that all you ever think 
about?&quot;

Kiyone looked at her. &quot;What else is worth the time?&quot; Mihoshi looked at 
Kiyone like she was crazy. &quot;Try relaxing sometime. I mean gosh Kiyone 
every time you find something you like you act all guilty about it 
just because it isn&#39;t work.&quot; Kiyone tried to think of a response but 
couldn&#39;t. It was all true. Mihoshi nodded, &quot;If it weren&#39;t for me you&#39;d 
probably kill yourself working.&quot;

Kiyone looked back, &quot;And if it weren&#39;t for me you wouldn&#39;t get any 
work done.&quot;

Mihoshi grinned and nodded. &quot;That&#39;s why we make such a great team. And 
if you just stopped blaming me for everything that goes wrong we could 
probably get a lot closer.&quot;

Kiyone blushed at the phrasing of Mihoshi&#39;s words. &quot;I don&#39;t blame you 
for everything. And most of the time you do something I yell at you 
for. Like when you blew up the engines, or when you plowed me down 
with the power suit. So don&#39;t go making it sound like I&#39;m not 
justified.&quot;

Mihoshi looked down at her lap. &quot;Well what about all those times you 
said it was my fault we weren&#39;t promoted? Or the times you called me 
your bad luck charm like I was the one that made your gun misfire or 
that you forgot to do a maintenance check on the engines in the first 
place. I wasn&#39;t even awake them. How could I have possibly have been 
the reason for that?&quot; Kiyone blushed. She didn&#39;t want to admit that 
she had been watching Mihoshi sleep. &quot;Ok, you&#39;re right. I do blame you 
too much and I&#39;m sorry alright?&quot; She lay back suddenly on her bed and 
they were both quiet for a minute listening to the sounds of Aeka&#39;s 
yelling from downstairs.

Finally Mihoshi just decided to change the subject. &quot;So how long do 
you suppose Aeka can keep this up?&quot;

Kiyone smirked and shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know. But considering how she 
took it she could be yelling like this forever. And when Tenchi and 
Ryoko go on their trip she&#39;ll most likely yell a lot more when they 
get back.&quot; Mihoshi grabbed two hunks of her hair in her hands and 
pulled them down in an impersonation of Aeka&#39;s pony tales. &quot;&#39;That&#39;s 
right because it&#39;s improper for that pirate to be alone with him in 
the middle of space.&#39;&quot; Kiyone laughed. &quot;That&#39;s pretty good Mihoshi.&quot; 
Mihoshi laughed too. &quot;Now you do one.&quot; Without thinking Kiyone pulled 
her hair up in her hand. &quot;&#39;Well that shows what you know princess.&#39;&quot; 
They laughed again. Finally they lay down again.

&quot;Oh that was fun Kiyone.&quot; Kiyone nodded agreement. &quot;Yeah.&quot; Mihoshi 
closed her eyes for a moment enjoying the memory of Kiyone&#39;s laugh. 
Suddenly there was a beeping sound. Mihoshi peeked out of her eye lid 
and saw Kiyone going over some police reports on her wrist computer. 
Mihoshi sighed, &quot;Kiyone...&quot; She looked up from her wrist at Mihoshi. 
&quot;What?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

The next week Washu stopped by their room before they left for the 
karaoke bar again. &quot;Could you two do me a favor? I was curious about 
the social structure of this planet so I was hoping you could 
videotape it for me.&quot; Kiyone was trying to think of a polite way to 
turn her down when Mihoshi piped up that she would be glad to. Washu 
handed her the camera and left. Kiyone looked at her angrily. &quot;Mihoshi 
why did you agree to do that?&quot; Mihoshi looked at her and shrugged. 
&quot;We&#39;re going to be there anyway. Besides maybe she&#39;ll let us have a 
copy.&quot; Kiyone sighed. &quot;Fine, let&#39;s just go and get this over with.&quot;

When they got home that night it was quite similar to the other night. 
Tenchi and Ryoko greeted them, Aeka was sitting in the chair and 
Sasami was on the couch. Mihoshi and Kiyone went to Washu&#39;s door and 
knocked. Washu opened it. &quot;Oh, thanks guys.&quot; She took the camera. &quot;Hey 
Washu, can we have a copy of that?&quot; Mihoshi asked. The scientist 
looked up and shrugged. &quot;Sure, no problem. Just hold on a second.&quot; She 
ducked back inside and came back a few minutes later holding the tape. 
&quot;Here you go. I just downloaded it into my computer.&quot; Mihoshi took the 
tape and they left.

Tenchi looked at the tape in Mihoshi&#39;s hands. &quot;Do you two want to put 
that in the VCR?&quot; Mihoshi shook her head. &quot;No Tenchi, I&#39;ll wait until 
tomorrow. I&#39;m a little tired and I think Kiyone will probably want to 
do some work before she goes to sleep.&quot; She walked up the stairs 
totally unaware of Kiyone staring after her. Kiyone meanwhile was 
shocked. On the walk home all Mihoshi had talked about was getting a 
copy of the tape. Kiyone had simply kept quiet.

When she got up to her room Mihoshi was laying in her bed fast asleep. 
She sat down on her bed and reached for her wrist to go over some 
reports. But suddenly she stopped and looked at Mihoshi again, laying 
there so peacefully. She put her wrist down and sighed. She didn&#39;t 
want to work right then. Kiyone really wished she could be as carefree 
as Mihoshi always seemed to be. After a while she closed her eyes and 
joined her partner in sleep.

The next day however, she was woken up by Mihoshi shaking her. &quot;Come 
on Kiyone. Everyone else is out of the house and I want to see the 
video.&quot; Kiyone sighed and rolled over. &quot;Why? You were there last 
night. So was I. So why do we need to watch ourselves?&quot; Mihoshi just 
smiled and tried to pull her out of the bed. Kiyone gave in and got 
up.&quot; They went downstairs and found some cereal. &quot;How did we sleep in 
this late Mihoshi?&quot; The blond just shrugged.

Once they were done eating Kiyone flopped down on the couch and 
Mihoshi ran to plug the tape in. Then she sat down next to Kiyone and 
hit the play button on the remote.

&quot;Mihoshi will you get that camera out of my face?&quot; Kiyone yelled. The 
camera panned to the left showing the street and showed some cars and 
people walking down the sidewalk. After a while they arrived at the 
bar. Kiyone was seen sitting at the bar for a drink and the camera was 
set down by her arm. &quot;I&#39;ll have a cider.&quot; Kiyone said. Mihoshi could 
be heard ordering a Shirley Temple. &quot;Mmm, this is good. You should try 
it Kiyone.&quot; The glass passed by the camera lens. &quot;No thanks Mihoshi, 
I&#39;ll stick with my drink.&quot;

After a while Mihoshi talked Kiyone into going to the karaoke booth. 
Mihoshi videotaped Kiyone singing. On the couch Kiyone frowned. She 
knew her scores were bad, but hearing herself sing like that was just 
too much. Next Mihoshi went up. Her singing wasn&#39;t much better. 
Mihoshi walked back after her song and looked right in the camera. 
&quot;Come on Kiyone, let&#39;s just set it down here and sing a few together.&quot; 
The camera shook as they set it down. Then they both walked up and 
began to sing.

On the couch Kiyone stared ahead in rapt awe. The sounds that came 
over her ears were what first caught her attention, but that wasn&#39;t 
it. On the screen Kiyone&#39;s fingers intertwined with Mihoshi&#39;s and they 
looked directly into each other&#39;s eyes. Kiyone remembered every moment 
of it, but somehow seeing like this was different. As the Kiyone and 
Mihoshi on the screen sang they kept getting closer and closer. Kiyone 
tried to convince herself that it was just because that was how people 
who sang did these things, but they were way to close for that. Next 
to her on the couch Mihoshi said, &quot;Wow Kiyone. You were so beautiful. 
And the way you were singing was just great.&quot; Kiyone just stared at 
the screen.

Finally the tape ran out just as they finished their last song and had 
pushed their chests together. It started to rewind itself. From beside 
her Mihoshi turned and smiled. &quot;Hey Kiyone, what did you think?&quot; 
Kiyone turned and looked at Mihoshi. She saw how close the other 
detective&#39;s face was to her. Without thinking Kiyone jumped up and ran 
out the door. &quot;Kiyone? Kiyone where are you going?&quot; Mihoshi called 
after her.

Kiyone ran off into the forest. The sunlight streamed through the 
leaves of the trees onto her face. Tears started falling and caught 
the light. &quot;No, it... it can&#39;t be...&quot; She whispered over and over 
again as she ran. Suddenly she stopped and leaned back against a tree. 
Sinking to the ground she let her head lay on her knees. Sobbing 
quietly she said to herself, &quot;It isn&#39;t true...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Back at the house Mihoshi sat on the couch looking out the window in 
the direction Kiyone had run. She couldn&#39;t figure out what was so 
upsetting about the tape. After all she had been there when the tape 
was shot. All Mihoshi had said was that she thought Kiyone looked 
beautiful and asked what she thought about the whole thing. Then she 
had just... run away. Suddenly Mihoshi&#39;s eyes lit up. If Kiyone was 
embarrassed and felt guilty... then that meant she must really like 
her! Mihoshi giggled and hugged a couch cushion. Blushing she bit her 
lip and curled up.

Sasami watched her from the kitchen and so did Ryo-oki sitting on 
Sasami&#39;s head. &quot;What do you suppose happened to her?&quot; The cabbit 
meowed. &quot;Really? Constipation huh? I don&#39;t know, maybe we should ask 
her.&quot; Ryo-oki meowed again and shook her head. &quot;No I guess your right. 
Whatever it is it&#39;s her business. And Aeka always says a princess 
doesn&#39;t gossip. Of course she gossips all the time but still...&quot; She 
turned back and started making lunch. &quot;Maybe after she eats she&#39;ll 
feel like telling us what&#39;s going on.&quot;

When lunchtime rolled around however Mihoshi was unusually quiet. 
Tenchi sat in the middle of his side of the table as always with Ryoko 
and Aeka on either side. Lately however Ryoko had been sitting just a 
little bit closer and Aeka was just as far away. Yosho sat on the 
other side with Mihoshi while Washu was at one of the heads. Sasami 
was across from her. &quot;So Mihoshi, where is Kiyone?&quot; Tenchi asked. 
Mihoshi just smiled to herself and shrugged. Washu was watching her 
very closely for some reason. &quot;But Mihoshi, you must have some idea 
why she isn&#39;t here right?&quot; Washu prodded. Mihoshi looked up at Washu 
and got the same blank look she always got. Washu sighed and thought, 
&#39;So much for my fun.&#39; She sat back and ate listening to the others 
talk, or in Aeka and Ryoko&#39;s case argue.

After lunch Tenchi left to go out to the field while Aeka, Ryoko, and 
Sasami sat down to watch soap operas. Yosho went back to the shrine 
and Mihoshi went out to the porch to sleep in the sun. Washu was back 
in her lab and was watching everyone else. Ryo-oki jumped onto the 
couch with Sasami. .

------------------------------------------------------------

So what are you so afraid of? Asked a voice at the back of her mind. 
Kiyone looked up. &quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; Well why don&#39;t you think about it 
for a second. Kiyone bit her lip and leaned back against the tree 
trunk. &quot;It just doesn&#39;t feel right ok?&quot; Are you sure about that? 
Kiyone bit her lip. Maybe it&#39;s that it does feel right and you just 
refuse to admit it. &quot;Why would I be in... with Mihoshi.&quot; Be in what? 
Kiyone banged her head against the tree again. &quot;I&#39;m not going to say 
it!&quot; Say what? Kiyone kicked a rock away from her foot. &quot;Look, I&#39;m not 
in love with Mihoshi.&quot; Then what are you doing out here?

She hit the ground with her fist. &quot;Well if you&#39;re so smart what do you 
think?&quot; Well then why &#39;don&#39;t&#39; you love her? &quot;Because she&#39;s a ditz, she 
causes me a lot of useless trouble, and if it weren&#39;t for her I&#39;d be 
back at the main office right now.&quot; Would you buy that if you were 
me... which you are. &quot;No, I guess not. I mean I didn&#39;t have to come 
back here.&quot; That&#39;s what I thought. And you already admitted that you 
blame her for too much. So what&#39;s your excuse now? Kiyone sat there 
quietly for a while. &quot;Can we move onto a new question now?&quot; Ok, so 
what would your life be like without her?

Kiyone grinned. &quot;That&#39;s an easy one. Sane!&quot; Ha, very funny. Lets 
picture it shall we? The image of Kiyone working at her desk appeared. 
People coming and going all around her. They asked her to go out, but 
she was too busy. Her days off people asking her to come check out the 
new karaoke bar. No, need to catch up on my work. See? Without Mihoshi 
around you&#39;d just work all the time. And how long would you stay sane 
with that? The image of her in a straight jacket mumbling about 
needing to get to work shot through her mind. &quot;Fine, but why her? Why 
not some cute guy?&quot; The voice was quiet.

&quot;Ha, knew that one would stump you.&quot; She said. Of course, if you don&#39;t 
know how am I supposed to? Kiyone shrugged and sighed. &quot;In that case 
why don&#39;t you do something constructive?&quot; Hey these are your thoughts. 
&quot;In that case why am I trying to hook me up with Mihoshi?&quot; Because you 
love her. &quot;No I...&quot; She stopped again and looked out into the woods. 
&quot;Ok, what if I do? It would still be weird and she probably doesn&#39;t 
feel like that anyway. I mean look at her. She&#39;s probably got a ton of 
guys whenever she goes out.&quot; In that case why does she spend all her 
time with you? Kiyone looked back towards the house. Besides, didn&#39;t 
she say you were beautiful?

Kiyone smiled and blushed a bit at that last thought, then she frowned 
and shook her head. &quot;No. That was nothing.&quot; But doubts began eating 
away at her. What if it wasn&#39;t nothing? You only focused on your own 
face when you watched the tape. What did you see in her eyes? 
&quot;Nothing, just that same dopey expression I see every time she looks 
at me.&quot; The same expression you saw on your face when you two sang. 
&quot;No... well yeah I guess.&quot; She screamed and threw a hand full of dirt. 
&quot;When did life get so slagging complicated?&quot; Nobody answered.

Looking up at the leaves above her she thought about Mihoshi. She 
thought about the blond detectives face, the way that one strand of 
hair was always getting caught in her eyelashes, the way she laughed 
when she was watching her cartoons. How she would twirl her feet when 
she was listening to music.

How the heck did Tenchi handle this? These feelings in her were too 
confusing. Always before she could figure out what she was feeling and 
why. But now she felt so helpless. And the thought of actually kissing 
Mihoshi was just... whoa! Where the hell did that one come from? Her 
kissing Mihoshi. No way would that ever happen... would it? The idea 
sent a chill down her spine. She had to talk with Mihoshi. If she 
could only figure out some way to get her partner to tell her how she 
felt before she said anything.

------------------------------------------------------------

Kiyone got home just before sunset. Tenchi was already there and was 
sitting with Ryoko discussing their trip. Aeka was reading a romance 
novel. Noboyuki had just gotten home from work and was coming down the 
stairs. Sasami called everyone for dinner and Mihoshi shot down the 
stairs past him. Kiyone looked up when she saw Mihoshi but suddenly 
looked down and blushed.

Mihoshi bit her lip excitedly and sat down at the table. Once everyone 
was seated and eating she sat quietly and looked down at her plate. 
Tenchi was telling everyone, &quot;The carrots are almost ready. And I 
graduate next week too.&quot; Ryoko grinned and hugged him tightly. &quot;And 
then we get to go on our honeymoon don&#39;t we Tenchi dear.&quot; Tenchi 
blushed and Aeka shivered. She still hadn&#39;t gotten used to the idea 
that babies weren&#39;t left in trees by the goddess. And of course once 
they were alone Sasami had shocked her by saying that she had known 
all along how babies were made.

&quot;So Kiyone,

where were you all day? We missed you at lunch.&quot; Tenchi asked. &quot;Are 
you feeling alright?&quot; Kiyone nodded and took a bite of her food. I&#39;m 
fine Tenchi, I just needed to think about some things.&quot; Tenchi smiled 
and nodded. Sasami smiled and looked at her. &quot;Hey Kiyone, I heard you 
and Mihoshi playing that tape before you left. When you two sing 
together it sounds really good.&quot; Kiyone blushed and tried to think of 
a response. Washu stepped in. &quot;I saw that too. Thanks again for 
getting that for me.&quot; Kiyone mentally kicked herself. If she had known 
what was going to be on that tape she would never have let Washu 
anywhere near it. &quot;But aside from that there wasn&#39;t anything really 
remarkable about it.&quot; Kiyone&#39;s eyes shot up and looked at Washu who 
gave her a wink. Tenchi was looking at Ryoko and she was looking back 
at him. Everyone else was talking about something or other so that 
only Kiyone saw the wink. She bit her lip and nodded gratefully.

Unfortunately Washu had just been confirming her suspicions and 
decided to tease her. &quot;By the way, I was going over the mind date from 
the first mechanical Washu and found some interesting things. You&#39;d be 
amazed at the way Mihoshi sees some people.&quot; Despite herself Kiyone&#39;s 
interest was peeked. She was listening intently to what Washu was 
about to say. &quot;Washu that&#39;s not right. If Mihoshi wanted to tell us 
what she thinks of us that&#39;s up to her.&quot; Mihoshi looked up at Washu. 
&quot;What do I think of everyone?&quot; Washu and the others moaned. Kiyone 
however wanted to head Washu off before she said something that Kiyone 
might regret. &quot;You already know what you think Mihoshi.&quot; Mihoshi bit 
her lip. &quot;Oh.&quot;

Washu grinned. &quot;Well I was just going to say she&#39;s a lot smarter than 
we give her credit for. In fact if I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d swear she 
used that airhead attitude to manipulate us. Like right now for 
example. I&#39;d almost think there was something she wanted me to tell 
someone so she wouldn&#39;t have too.&quot; Mihoshi blushed and looked down at 
her plate exactly as Kiyone had done. &quot;Now Washu, how could I possibly 
manipulate anyone?&quot; Washu was about to respond when Tenchi put his 
hand up. &quot;Enough Washu, teasing her &quot; Washu pouted and took a bite of 
her food.

Kiyone however had noticed that Mihoshi was avoiding looking at her 
all of a sudden. She knew that the blond wasn&#39;t THAT air headed. Had 
even been in special operations before being assigned to be Kiyone&#39;s 
problem. But the thought that she used her innocent comments to 
manipulate a situation... No way.

------------------------------------------------------------

Once they were in their room Kiyone sat on her bed looking at the 
wall. She didn&#39;t even try to get any work started. Mihoshi noticed 
this and watched her for a while. &quot;Kiyone are you alright? You ran out 
of the house this morning before answering my question.&quot; Kiyone looked 
up at her and blushed again. &quot;Um... what question Mihoshi?&quot; Mihoshi 
grinned. &quot;I asked what you thought of the tape of us singing.&quot; 
Kiyone&#39;s blush deepened. I have to get this over or my node will start 
bleeding like Tenchi&#39;s does, she thought to herself. &quot;Well, I ... I 
mean it was... it got me thinking.&quot; Mihoshi&#39;s grin got just a bit 
bigger. &quot;Oh? And what exactly were you thinking about?&quot; Kiyone&#39;s jaw 
dropped in shock.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it! She was right and you do it!&quot; Mihoshi tried to 
look empty headed and innocent. &quot;What do you mean Kiyone?&quot; Kiyone 
jumped up from her bed and pointed a finger right at her face. &quot;See! 
You&#39;re doing it again. You&#39;re trying to find out what I think by 
asking little questions!&quot; Mihoshi&#39;s eyes got real big and she shook 
her head softly. &quot;Now what would make you say something like that?&quot; 
Kiyone was too caught up to realize she was being tricked, &quot;Because 
that&#39;s what I was planning to...I mean um...&quot; She sat back on her bed 
her face completely red.

Mihoshi bit her lip and giggled. &quot;And what exactly were you planning 
Kiyone?&quot; Kiyone closed her eyes and shook her head. No way was this 
happening. Maybe she was misreading things. Maybe Mihoshi&#39;s questions 
were completely innocent. There was only one way to find out. Taking a 
deep breath she looked at Mihoshi. &quot;What do you think I was planning?&quot; 
Mihoshi grinned and blushed. A small giggle escaped her lips, &quot;It 
wouldn&#39;t be polite to second guess someone.&quot;

Kiyone sat there quietly for a while thinking. &quot;So Mihoshi... you 
never did tell me. Ever have a boyfriend?&quot; Mihoshi nodded but didn&#39;t 
stop smiling. &quot;A long time ago when I was in school. But I didn&#39;t 
really get along with him. I&#39;ve got... other interests now.&quot; She 
giggled again. &quot;How about you Kiyone?&quot; Kiyone blushed and shook her 
head. &quot;Uh... no. Too busy I guess.&quot; Mihoshi looked at her closely and 
smiled at her. &quot;Well there must be someone you like...&quot; Kiyone rolled 
over and looked at the wall. &quot;Maybe... Oh would you look at the time. 
I need to get to sleep.&quot; She pulled the covers over her head. &quot;But 
Kiyone, you&#39;re still in your clothes.&quot; Kiyone covered her head. &quot;Uh... 
that way I&#39;m ready in the morning. Good night Mihoshi.&quot;

Mihoshi pouted. &quot;Good night Kiyone. I guess I&#39;ll just change my 
clothes and go to bed if you are.&quot; She got up and took off her shirt. 
Kiyone had her head under the blankets. She had seen Mihoshi change 
before, why did this time feel so different? She peeked out from under 
the blanket. Mihoshi&#39;s back was to her and she was busy undoing her 
bra. Kiyone watched her for a second. Suddenly Mihoshi glanced back at 
her and she covered her head up again. Mihoshi smiled and giggled 
slightly. Then she frowned. What if she really doesn&#39;t like me? Maybe 
she just acts that way when we sing because she likes singing.

Quietly and quickly Mihoshi put her nightclothes on and got into bed. 
She lay on her side looking towards the blob under Kiyone&#39;s blanket. 
Finally after a long time she closed her eyes and went to sleep. Once 
she heard Mihoshi&#39;s snoring Kiyone poked her head out from under the 
blanket. She watched Mihoshi asleep in the bed in front of her. She 
hadn&#39;t actually clarified anything. Mihoshi could have been dancing 
around her questions or she could have just been acting like herself. 
All she&#39;d really done was make herself feel embarrassed.

Wait, that wasn&#39;t entirely true. She had found out that Mihoshi didn&#39;t 
actually have a boyfriend. She smiled and shook her head in 
self-amazement. How had she gone from total denial to actually 
planning on ways to find out if she could be part of Mihoshi&#39;s love 
life? She shook her head. It didn&#39;t matter, it had happened. Now she 
just had to keep from embarrassing herself. If she were wrong about 
Mihoshi she would just make her partner feel uncomfortable around her. 
Now Kiyone knew a little about what Tenchi must have been going 
through. She really should apologize for teasing him so much.

She watched Mihoshi breath for a while and smiled. She seemed so 
peaceful and cute laying there. Cute? She wanted to dismiss the 
thought but couldn&#39;t. It was absolutely true in her opinion and she 
had to admit it. She was attracted to Mihoshi. She smiled and closed 
her eyes. Then, she too drifted off into sleep. That night Mihoshi&#39;s 
face danced at the edge of her dreams.

------------------------------------------------------------

The next morning Mihoshi woke up to the smell of Sasami&#39;s cooking 
coming from downstairs. Slowly she opened her eyes and saw Kiyone 
changing her clothes. She grinned and as Kiyone slipped her new shirt 
on said, &quot;I thought you said you were sleeping in your clothes so 
you&#39;d be ready in the morning.&quot; Kiyone jumped and looked down at her. 
She took a deep breath and managed a smiled. &quot;Oh... I just... changed 
my mind. Come on or we&#39;ll be late for breakfast.&quot; She ran downstairs 
leaving Mihoshi to get dressed. Mihoshi sighed and climbed out of bed. 
Then she got an idea. Tenchi used to run away from Ryoko like that. 
But then again he acted that way when Aeka was around too. Feeling sad 
she went to her dresser and got some clothes.

Downstairs Kiyone picked up her plate from Sasami and headed towards 
the table. &quot;Kiyone?&quot; Kiyone stopped and smiled at Sasami. &quot;Yes?&quot; 
Sasami looked up at her. &quot;I know you said you were alright and 
everything, but you&#39;ve been really quiet lately.&quot; She looked down that 
the little princess. Sasami always seemed to be able to tell when 
something wasn&#39;t right. &quot;It&#39;s just something I&#39;m working on Sasami.&quot; 
Sasami nodded then just as Kiyone turned she said. &quot;Is that what you 
call it?&quot; Kiyone stopped cold and turned back to Sasami who had turned 
to get her own plate. &quot;What... what do you mean?&quot; Sasami kept her face 
perfectly calm. &quot;Oh nothing. By the way on a completely unrelated 
subject you might want to put away that tape of yours. I found it in 
the VCR yesterday.&quot; She walked passed Kiyone who stood there with her 
face turning red again.

She deserved that and she knew it. Sasami wouldn&#39;t tell but the 
princess had made a good point. She shouldn&#39;t have referred to it as 
work. Kiyone calmed down and went to sit at the table. She kept 
shooting glances towards the television however waiting for her chance 
to casually get the tape out without anyone asking questions. Mihoshi 
came down the stairs and cheerily said,&quot; Good morning Kiyone.&quot; Kiyone 
blushed and said, &quot;Um... good morning Mihoshi.&quot; Mihoshi&#39;s face fell 
for a second and she went to the kitchen to get her plate.

Kiyone just seemed so... distant. Maybe she&#39;d figured out that Mihoshi 
liked her and was trying to avoid her. At that moment Mihoshi wished 
she would at least yell at her. Then she&#39;d know for sure what was 
happening. Then again maybe Kiyone did like her and she cheered up. 
She could just be embarrassed.

Mihoshi came out of the kitchen smiling and Kiyone smiled at her too. 
Mihoshi&#39;s heart leaped. Then Kiyone looked back at her food. She was 
still smiling though so Mihoshi had hope. &quot;So Kiyone, want to go hang 
out by the lake today and sunbathe?&quot; Kiyone&#39;s eyes widened and she bit 
her lip. Mihoshi started, &quot;Of course if you don&#39;t want to...&quot; She was 
cut off. &quot;No Mihoshi it&#39;s alright. I mean I have nothing else to do 
and since we saved Jurai this place has been moved out of the major 
traffic area so there is nothing else to do... So sure, let&#39;s hang out 
by the lake after chores are done.&quot; She couldn&#39;t believe she&#39;d said 
that.

Washu and Sasami took that moment to sip some milk from theory glasses 
to hide their grins of amusement. Then they both saw each other across 
the table... Nah. Maybe next time I run out of story ideas or want to 
write a lemon. They just both winked and set their glasses down. Aeka 
had finally decided

that the whole sex thing was a fact of life and was chatting with 
Yosho about the things they missed about Jurai. Tenchi and Ryoko were 
eating breakfast while Ryoko kept trying to grab his hand under the 
table. Mihoshi watched them and wished that Kiyone would do that with 
her.

After breakfast Sasami assigned chores while Tenchi and the other men 
went off to school and work. Kiyone heard her named mentioned and 
snapped out of her daydreams. &quot;Kiyone why don&#39;t you clean up the 
living room?&quot; She glanced towards the VCR and Kiyone nodded. &quot;Sure 
thing Sasami.&quot; She got to work on the living room, vacuuming under the 
furniture and dusting the tables. Finally she finished and quickly 
popped the tape out. She carried it up to her room and hid it under 
her bed. Mihoshi came in right after she pulled her hand out and saw 
her bending over her bed. She smiled and let her eyes travel over 
Kiyone&#39;s body. Kiyone stood up and suddenly saw Mihoshi standing 
there. &quot;Um... hi Mihoshi.&quot; Mihoshi smiled and said, &quot;Hi Kiyone! Are 
you ready?&quot; Kiyone panicked for a second before remembering their 
plans. &quot;Oh... the lake right. Sure.&quot; Mihoshi smiled and turned to her 
dresser. She grabbed her bathing suit. Kiyone blushed only just 
realizing that she would need to change into her suit to.

Mihoshi turned around smiling. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to get changed 
Kiyone? I think you&#39;d look really cute in that one you wore to the 
swimsuit contest. And this time maybe you wont get any tan lines. 
Kiyone nodded numbly and Mihoshi tossed her swim suit. She caught it 
and froze when Mihoshi started taking off her shirt. Then she blushed 
as she realized that Mihoshi had neglected to wear a bra. Mihoshi 
turned to Kiyone, &quot;Come on, we don&#39;t have all day.&quot; Kiyone swallowed 
and slowly began removing her clothes. Once she was down to nothing 
she quickly put on her top and bottom. For a split second she stopped 
and looked at Mihoshi&#39;s body. For some reason she had stopped before 
putting on her swimsuit to stretch. But of course it couldn&#39;t be the 
blatant come on it seemed. No Mihoshi was just touching her toes... 
she had to be.

Mihoshi looked up and saw Kiyone glancing away. Smiling she put her 
swimsuit on and they both went to the hall closet to grab some towels. 
As they walked down the stairs Kiyone remarked, &quot;You know you said 
that maybe today I would get no tan lines? Well for that to happen I 
would have to take off my bathing suit.&quot; Mihoshi grinned. &quot;Yes you 
would... hey what a great idea. Why don&#39;t we just lay out there 
naked?&quot; Kiyone began to stutter but couldn&#39;t think of a reasonable 
excuse since it was technically her idea. Besides it wasn&#39;t like she 
hadn&#39;t seen Mihoshi naked before right? On the way out Mihoshi grabbed 
a bottle of suntan lotion.

They were at the lake before they knew it. They lay out their towels 
and Mihoshi peeled off her swimsuit. Kiyone needed something to take 
her eyes off of her partner so she had to remove her swimsuit too. 
Once she got it off she looked back at Mihoshi who was busily applying 
suntan lotion. Kiyone watched transfixed as Mihoshi&#39;s hands worked 
over her body slowly working the oil in. Mihoshi smiled having noticed 
to look on Kiyone&#39;s face. Now came the test. &quot;Um... Kiyone?&quot; Kiyone 
snapped out of it and brought her eyes up to Mihoshi&#39;s. &quot;Yeah?&quot; 
Mihoshi blushed, &quot;Would you mind getting my back? I can&#39;t reach it.&quot; 
Kiyone nodded and numbly took the suntan oil. She squirted some onto 
her hand and reached out to apply it to her shoulders.

Mihoshi smiled and leaned back slightly into Kiyone&#39;s fingers. Kiyone 
pushed back and moved along Mihoshi&#39;s spine. Was it her imagination or 
did Mihoshi just shiver? Kiyone finally reluctantly removed her hand 
and began applying her own lotion. Out of the corner of her eye she 
saw Mihoshi watching her. She grinned and said, &quot;Now it&#39;s your turn.&quot; 
Mihoshi nodded and started rubbing lotion into Kiyone&#39;s back. &quot;Hey 
guys, mind if I join you?&quot; They both jumped as Ryoko appeared next to 
them. Looking embarrassed they both looked up at her. &quot;Um... no, it&#39;s 
fine Ryoko.&quot;

Ryoko lay out her own towel right between the two of them and her own 
clothes vanished. She lay down and put on some sunglasses. Kiyone and 
Mihoshi both sighed and lay back, trying to enjoy the sun. They all 
turned over after a while and lay on their bellies. The entire time 
all either GP officer could think about was the feel of the other&#39;s 
hands on their skin.

Finally Ryoko looked up at the sun. &quot;Well, Tenchi and Noboyuki will be 
home soon. And if I don&#39;t get out of the sun soon I might burn.&quot; She 
picked up her things and teleported back to the house. Once they were 
gone Kiyone and Mihoshi looked at each other again, but the mood was 
gone. Kiyone though smiled at Mihoshi. &quot;Thanks for putting on the 
suntan oil Mihoshi.&quot; Mihoshi smiled back, &quot;My pleasure Kiyone.&quot; Kiyone 
nodded and under her breath remarked, &quot;Mine too.&quot; They put their 
swimsuits back on and headed towards the house.

(The lemon part. At this time I wish to apologize for anything that 
seems clich&eacute; or corny. I will try my best to make this chapter 
tasteful as possible. I didn&#39;t actually plan this, it just kind of 
happened. I hope you wont think any less of me for this. Next time 
I&#39;ll try to do this without the sex but this time it was unavoidable.)

After dinner that night Mihoshi and Kiyone went up to their room. Once 
they were there they sat on their beds smiling nervously at each 
other. Finally Kiyone asked the question that had been tormenting her 
for days. &quot;Mihoshi... when you said I was beautiful... when we were 
watching the tape... did you mean it?&quot; Mihoshi nodded and looked at 
her eyes. &quot;Yes. Yes I did Kiyone. Did you mean it when you said it was 
your pleasure to today? About the sunscreen?&quot; Kiyone nodded.

They both sat there and thought about what they had just said. 
&quot;Mi...Mihoshi... how do you feel about me?&quot; Kiyone asked. Mihoshi 
looked up and into Kiyone&#39;s eyes. Slowly she slid off her bed and 
walked over to Kiyone. She sat down on the other bed with her face 
inches away from Kiyone&#39;s. It was now or never. &quot;I love you Kiyone.&quot; 
Kiyone&#39;s breath caught in her throat and her heart began beating 
faster. She slowly reached up and put her hand on Mihoshi&#39;s cheek. The 
blond pressed her head against it and smiled into Kiyone&#39;s eyes. &quot;I... 
I love you too Mihoshi.&quot; Tears sprang from Mihoshi&#39;s eyes. Her smile 
spread across her face and she laughed. &quot;Really? You mean it?&quot; Kiyone 
smiled back and nodded.

Mihoshi let her arm travel around Kiyone&#39;s shoulders. Kiyone&#39;s hand 
slowly wrapped around Mihoshi&#39;s waist and he head tipped slightly to 
the left. Mihoshi closed her eyes and Kiyone did the same. Slowly they 
leaned in and kissed. Kiyone shivered and pushed her mouth against 
Mihoshi&#39;s. Mihoshi began breathing heavily her breath blowing across 
Kiyone&#39;s face. They both opened their eyes and backed away. &quot;Mihoshi 
that was...&quot; Mihoshi nodded and said, &quot;... incredible!&quot; Kiyone blushed 
and looked at her. &quot;Do you want to..?&quot; Mihoshi nodded again and said, 
&quot;More than anything Kiyone.&quot; They kissed again, this time with their 
mouths open. Kiyone felt her tongue touch Mihoshi&#39;s and moaned. 
Mihoshi moaned in response and ran her hand down Kiyone&#39;s side. Kiyone 
raised her arms up and broke apart from Mihoshi long enough for 
Mihoshi to remove her shirt.

Kiyone reached down and pulled Mihoshi&#39;s blouse off. Mihoshi looked 
into her eyes and said, &quot;Are you sure you want to do this Kiyone. I 
know you&#39;ve never actually had sex before so... are you sure?&quot; Kiyone 
looked at her and nodded. &quot;Mihoshi I am absolutely certain.&quot; Mihoshi 
grinned and leaned forward. She gently kissed Kiyone&#39;s neck and 
collarbone, eliciting yet another moan of pleasure from the green 
haired girl. Kiyone moved her hands up Mihoshi&#39;s back. Mihoshi did the 
same and began unhooking Kiyone&#39;s bra.

When it was finally undone Kiyone slid it off and they both backed up 
to admire each other&#39;s bodies. &quot;Wow Kiyone, you got a great tan 
today.&quot; Mihoshi said. Kiyone grinned and replied, &quot;You don&#39;t look so 
bad yourself Mihoshi.&quot; Kiyone reached down and unzipped her pants. 
Mihoshi did the same to hers, but kept her eyes on Kiyone&#39;s. They 
tossed their pants to the side. Mihoshi wasn&#39;t wearing any panties but 
Kiyone still had on the bottom to her bathing suit. Mihoshi looked 
down at it and smiled. Slowly she extended her hand and ran a finger 
over the cloth. Kiyone gasped slightly causing Mihoshi to look up, but 
Kiyone nodded for her to continue. Mihoshi leaned and kissed Kiyone 
again and gently squeezed Kiyone&#39;s crotch. Kiyone meanwhile ran a hand 
down the side of Mihoshi&#39;s cheek, down her neck, and lay her hand 
across Mihoshi&#39;s breast. Mihoshi&#39;s nipple stiffened under Kiyone&#39;s 
fingers. &quot;Ooo Kiyone. That feels good.&quot; Kiyone could only moan in 
response as Mihoshi&#39;s finger slipped into her swimsuit and began 
pulling it down her legs.

Mihoshi began kissing behind Kiyone&#39;s ear and moving down her body. 
Kiyone meanwhile had to raise her butt off the bed so that Mihoshi 
could get the swimsuit off. Mihoshi took the piece of cloth and tossed 
it onto the floor with their other clothes. Kiyone began squeezing 
Mihoshi&#39;s breast gently and twisting her nipple just

a bit. Mihoshi moaned and brought her own head down to Kiyone&#39;s 
breast. She kissed just above the nipple and licked across the edge. 
Kiyone moaned and slid her free hand down Mihoshi&#39;s back and across 
her left buttock. Then she lay back onto the bed with Mihoshi on top 
of her.

Mihoshi smiled at her and repositioned herself on the bed. Kiyone 
smiled up at her and pulled her in close. Their chests pressed against 
each other. &quot;I love you Mihoshi.&quot; Mihoshi smiled back. &quot;I love you to 
Kiyone. And I always will.&quot; Kiyone smiled and kissed her again. 
Mihoshi kissed back and moved against her. Finally they parts and 
Mihoshi got a grin on her face. She turned away from Kiyone and 
positioned herself in a sixty-nine position. Kiyone looked up and saw 
Mihoshi&#39;s vagina right above her face and blushed, unsure what to do. 
Fortunately Mihoshi didn&#39;t have that problem. She began by kissing 
Kiyone&#39;s inner thigh and licking the edge of her vagina. Kiyone moaned 
and squirmed underneath Mihoshi.

Kiyone reached up and ran her hand over Mihoshi&#39;s butt and smiled as 
goose bumps rose. Suddenly she noticed an odd smell coming from 
Mihoshi&#39;s pussy. She took a closer look and Mihoshi grinned when she 
felt Kiyone&#39;s breath on her. She leaned down and put her lips to 
Kiyone&#39;s pussy lips and began licking. Kiyone moaned and rubbed her 
thighs against Mihoshi&#39;s cheeks. Mihoshi smiled and gently nibbled at 
Kiyone&#39;s clit.

Kiyone felt Mihoshi&#39;s mouth working on her and decided to return the 
favor. She slowly slid a finger in on either side of Mihoshi&#39;s vagina 
and spread it open. Mihoshi let out a soft gasp into Kiyone&#39;s crotch 
as she felt her partner&#39;s tongue slide into her. Mihoshi bit her lip 
and enjoyed it for a minute. Then she slowly slid her own fingers into 
Kiyone. Kiyone meanwhile stopped licking and gasped in sudden pain. 
&quot;Ahh!&quot; Mihoshi stopped and looked back. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Kiyone. Are you 
alright?&quot; Kiyone looked back at her and shook her head. &quot;No... it&#39;s 
ok. Just go... slower.&quot; Mihoshi nodded and turned back. Kiyone lay 
there waiting for Mihoshi to do whatever she was going to do. She 
didn&#39;t have to wait long.

Mihoshi slowly slid a finger into Kiyone, being careful not to go in 
too far or fast. Kiyone gasped and bit down on her lip until it turned 
white. Mihoshi slowly slid in deeper until she felt herself press 
against something. She stopped and looked back at Kiyone nervously. 
Kiyone gritted her teeth and suddenly pushed herself into Mihoshi&#39;s 
fingers and let out a shuddered moan. &quot;Ahhh... Don&#39;t stop Mihoshi.&quot; 
Mihoshi slowly moved her fingers in and out rubbing against the sides 
of Kiyone&#39;s pussy. She saw some blood and fluids drip out and bent to 
lick them up.

Meanwhile Kiyone had recovered and the pain had begun to be replaced 
by pleasure. She leaned forward again and began licking at Mihoshi&#39;s 
clit, sucking at the tiny bit of juice the flowed out. They both 
moaned. &quot;Kiyone I think I&#39;m going to...&quot; Mihoshi shuddered and 
orgasmed into Kiyone&#39;s face. Kiyone licked it all up, though some 
managed to drip down her face. From below she felt something tighten 
and she reached her own climax. Mihoshi sucked and licked until Kiyone 
couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and came again.

They both lay there silently for a while. Them Mihoshi turned herself 
around so that she faced Kiyone. They kissed again. &quot;Thank you 
Mihoshi. That was wonderful.&quot; Mihoshi nodded and hugged her close. 
&quot;You too Kiyone.&quot; Kiyone weakly reached down and pulled the sheets up 
around them. They fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms.

Author&#39;s note

Ok, yet another Kiyone Mihoshi story that ended as a lemon. I try my 
best but sometimes sex just kind of sneaks into the story. Of course 
if you weren&#39;t looking for lemons you wouldn&#39;t have seen it. Usually I 
write stories involving Ryoko and Tenchi. Unfortunately sometimes I 
run out of ideas for them. That&#39;s why it&#39;s nice to have these too to 
fall back on. Don&#39;t worry, the next one I do with Mihoshi and Kiyone 
will be more romantic. I will also try to get it into the regular 
section. I can&#39;t promise anything though because I never know just how 
a story will develop while I&#39;m writing it. If you wish to comment 
about my work feel free to email me.</pre>
