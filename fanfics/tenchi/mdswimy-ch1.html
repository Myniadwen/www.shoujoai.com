<h1>My Dear Sweet Love; I Miss You</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/harjitd.html">HarjitD</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Authors notes: Yay! There were so many people that liked my other 
story called &#145;The feelings that I can&#146;t keep anymore; I love you&#146;, 
that I was crying in tears because I thought I was not good at any 
thing romantic. And some people actually cried because it was so 
sad&#133;all well if you haven&#146;t read it yet, I guess you go to 
shoujo-ai.com. It&#146;s a great site for lesbian relation ships. And also 
the reason I am writing this fanfic is that I read my first one and 
noticed that Washu was not in it that much&#133;and plus that I was 
wondering is that has she only went out with one person in her life, 
and got married with him. And the next thing I knew was that I had 
these ideas in my head of a fanfic of her. So this is why I am here 
writing this fanfic, so I hope you lot enjoy this, and Clayton, you 
better like this! Or else! Sorry about that, it&#146;s just that he made a 
very very mean MST out of my first fanfic, but it was funny though, so 
I better get on to the story, oh yeah also one thing, I do not own 
Tenchi or the other characters, if I did, I would be a man called 
Masaki and probably would not speak a word of English. And I would be 
stinking filthy RICH! So please don&#146;t sue me, I don&#146;t own nothing, my 
parents do, we only own, two Mercedes Benz, a brayton bmw, and a 
autograph bmw, a f 50 fariere, a twin turbo supra and a half a million 
pounds of a house&#133; see not rich at all&#133;on with the story&#133;oh yeah on 
more thing, this is a mix of the series like, the ovas, TV series, and 
shin Tenchi series, so please bare with me&#133;

------------------------------------------------------------

It was just another rainy and stormy day at the Masaki household, it 
has been a year since Tenchi has defeated Kagato, and also declared 
his love to Ryoko the space pirate. And so they went and got married 
after a few months. Ayeka, the first crown princess of Juri also 
declared her love to Ryoko, but did not win her heart, so they are the 
best of friends&#133;sometimes&#133; Officer Kiyone and Officer Mihoshi have 
also declared their love to each other, they have been going out for a 
whole year, and never been happier in their lives, when Mihoshi didn&#146;t 
do one of her &#145;accidents&#146;. The little princess of Juri, Sasami, has 
also met some one, a girl by the name of Yugi; they have been the best 
of friends since, but sometimes wish to be more. And lastly, Washu, 
who has decided to stop acting like a child and be her true form, and 
here the story begins&#133;

&#147;Its getting quit dark and pouring down quit fast here outside 
grandpa, can we please finish early?&#148; Said Tenchi holding his boken.

&#147;No, the only reason you want to finish early is because you want to 
see Ryoko&#133;&#148;Said Yosho, the Shinto priest of the Masaki&#146;s shrine, and 
also the distend Ruler of Juri.

&#147;Grandpa! Its get-&#148; 

* BANG*

&#147;OWCH!&#148; Said Tenchi with a large lump on his head.

&#147;You let your guard down Tenchi, all ways be prepared! And your 
training for today is still not over! How are you gone to protect the 
ones you love?&#148; Said Yosho, in one of his tones that says &#145;you better 
do what I say boy! Or I make you sweep to the next generation!&#146;

&#147;O.K grandpa, your right&#148; said Tenchi while rubbing his head.

&#147;I&#146;m always right, now lets begin&#148; said Yosho, with his boken and in 
his fighting stance. And they began straight away after that.

------------------------------------------------------------

AT THE MASAKI HOUSEHOLD

&#147;It&#146;s getting pretty dark out there&#148; said Ryoko, the wife of Lord 
Tenchi, the prince of Juri. And was also taking a sip of her warm tea.

&#147;Yeah, and dinner is almost ready, I hope Tenchi and brother Yosho 
won&#146;t be late&#148; said Sasami, waiting for the rice to finish boiling and 
ready to eat.

&#147;Yeah, I just want to spend more time with Tenchi!&#148; said Ryoko, 
getting another mischief smiles of hers.

&#147;Oh grow up&#133;&#148; Said Ayeka, who was infact jealous of Tenchi.

&#147;No, I won&#146;t, I just love him to bits! Is that a crime?&#148; said Ryoko, 
who knew why Ayeka was getting a bit jealous. Ayeka just ignored 
Ryoko, and just took another sip of her tea, and went back to her 
book. Of course taking quick glances at Ryoko. 

&#147;Oh you guys, has any one seen Mihoshi and Kiyone? Dinner is almost 
ready, and they haven&#146;t come-&#148;Said Sasami who was cut off by the faint 
noises and moans coming form Kiyone and Mihoshi room. &#147;I think I&#146;m 
spouse to not hear that sort of langue when I&#146;m older&#133;&#148;

&#147;I guess there gone to be late for dinner tonight&#133;&#148; said Ryoko with a 
smirk.

&#147;Um, so where&#146;s little Washu?&#148; said Sasami, who was trying to change 
the subject, and also a little blush across her face.

&#147;I guess that she still at her lab, shall I go and get her?&#148; said 
Ryoko.

&#147;Yes please&#148; said Sasami who was now emptying the water out so only 
the rice is left.

&#147;OK&#148; and with that, Ryoko went off to get her mother, and when she 
finally was infrount of the closet door, she knock twice. And within a 
couple of seconds, Washu opened the door, with red bloodshot eyes, and 
tear stained face.

&#147;Um, mom, is something wrong?&#148; said Ryoko who was worried about her 
mother. &#147;No, theres nothing wrong little Ryoko.&#148; Said Washu, who was 
whipping the tears of her face. &#147;Are you sure mom, it looks like 
you&#146;ve been crying, do you want to talk about it? Said Ryoko who was 
wondering why her mother has been crying. &#147;Don&#146;t worry your little 
pretty face off Ryoko-chan, its nothing, so why do you want me?&#148; said 
Washu, changing the subject. &#147;Oh, yeah, um, Sasami made dinner.&#148; &#147;Oh, 
can you please tell every one that I won&#146;t be joining them tonight, I 
have to do finish off a experiment, ok?&#148; said Washu. &#147;OK, but if you 
get hungry, there gonna bee left overs in the fridge ok?&#148; said Ryoko, 
turning back to go to the kitchen. &#147;Ok, bye&#148; and with that, Washu shut 
the door behind her and went off in to the distance.

------------------------------------------------------------

WASHU&#146;S LAB

In the dark, Washu was walking off to the distance were her computer 
and the floating cushion was. When she finally reached it, she sat on 
the cushion, and gave a little sigh that sounded depressed&#133; &#147;It looks 
like another rainy night&#133;just like before, when I met her&#133;&#148; she gave a 
little tear away, rolling down her cheek, with a week and a sad smile 
and said &#147;It feels like it just happened yesterday&#133;&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

FLASHBACK

The rain was pouring hard while the thunder was roaring in the deep 
black sky. The rain was hitting on top of the ground, grass, and the 
trees. The place looked like it was the royal gardens. But infact it 
was the science academe. In the distance, there was a young tall 
looking girl, running towards the bench were the shelter is, covering 
over the bench. She reached it. Gasping for air. She had long spiky 
pink and red colour hair. She was wearing a Michigan football full 
sleeve top and dark green shorts, and a pair of green slippers. She 
sat down on the bench, shivering a bit. &#147;Next time I look at the 
weather report&#133;&#148; said the girl. She turns to her right side and looked 
off to the distance. And in the distance there was another girl 
running. The girl was curies and waited to see where she was running 
off too. The girl was running to the shelter where the pink haired 
girl was sitting down. The girl stopped underneath the shelter gasping 
for air, she was tall as the pink haired girl was. And she had black 
hair that was straight and was feathered at the front of the side 
hairs. She had deep rich sliver eyes that glittered along with the 
stars. She was fairly tanned, and she was wearing a black short 
jacket, underneath she was wearing a non-sleeve black top and a pair 
of black shorts, and a pair of trainers. She turned around too see a 
person on the bench looking at her.

&#147;Uh, hi, my name is Arial, what&#146;s yours?&#148; said Arial with a smile.

&#147;Washu&#133;&#148; she said still in her daydream gaze.

&#147;Your Miss Washu right? One of the science teachers of this school?&#148; 
said Arial, while sitting down next to her.

&#147;Yeah, that&#146;s right, I take it you&#146;ve heard of me?&#148; Said Washu, 
getting out of her gaze.

&#147;Yeah I have, you spouse to be the smartest teacher there is&#148; said 
Arial.

&#147;Thanks, so I haven&#146;t seen you around here before, are you visiting a 
friend?&#148; said Washu.

&#147;No, I&#146;m new around here, I just came to this school yesterday.&#148; Said 
Arial, looking at Washu.

&#147;Oh I see, so what brings you here to the gardens?&#148; Said Washu.

&#147;Oh I just like taking nice walks in the nature kind of parks, it 
clears my thoughts, specially my boyfriend broke up with me&#133;&#148; said 
Arial, getting annoyed.

&#147;Oh I see, I&#146;m sorry to here that, may I ask why he broke up with 
you?&#148; said Washu, looking at Arial.

&#147;Because that jerk dumped me for another girl, and to tell you the 
truth, she has a IQ of a fish.&#148; Said Arial.

Washu chuckled a bit at this and said &#147;Don&#146;t worry, I&#146;m sure theres 
someone out there who is perfect for you.&#148;

&#147;You think so Miss Washu?&#148; said Arial.

&#147;Yes I&#146;m sure there is, plus its his loss, you seem to be a nice 
bright girl, I&#146;m sure theres plenty of guys who wants to be with you.&#148;

* Thunder *

&#147;AAAAHHH!!&#148; and with that, Arial jumped and was next to Washu, 
cuddling her arm and put her head in the arm, and was shaking and 
frighten like a scared little child.

&#147;What&#146;s wrong??&#148; said Washu, who put an arm around her.

&#147;I-I h-hate thunder storms&#148; said Arial still frightened and was infact 
crying abit of fear.

&#147;There, there, don&#146;t worry, I&#146;m here, nothings going to hurt you.&#148; 
said Washu, who was rocking Arial back and forth to comfort her. &#147;Do 
you want me to take you back to your room?&#148; said Washu with a warm 
smile.

&#147;Yes please, I don&#146;t want to be out here anymore&#133;&#148;said Arial, who 
looked at Washu.

And with that, Washu took her hand and ran to the Science academe.

------------------------------------------------------------

FROUNT OF ARIAL&#146;S ROOM

&#147;Thank you Miss Washu, I &#145;m sorry for being a burden for you&#148; said 
Arial who put her hands together behind her back and was facing the 
ground blushing.

&#147;You wasn&#146;t a burden for me Arial, besides, it was nice to get to know 
a student more in this school.&#148; Said Washu, who put her hand under 
Arial&#146;s chin, so she can see those sliver eyes of hers.

* Thunder* 

&#147;AAAHHH!!&#148; screamed Arial and went to Washu&#146;s arms. Washu then put her 
arms around Arial to comfort her. 

&#147;I guess you&#146;re still frightened&#133;&#148; said Washu with her caring warm 
smile.

&#147;Y-yeah, s-s-sorry about that&#133;&#148;said Arial who looked up at Washu. &#147;I&#146;m 
sorry to ask you this b-but, I-I mean, can you s-stay with me over the 
night, I-I mean because I just don&#146;t like being alone in the thunder 
storm all by my self..&#148; said Arial who was blushing rather red.

&#147;..Yeah sure, I don&#146;t mind, its ok with me&#148; said Washu with a smile. &#147; 
I had a friend who was scared of the thunder storm as well, so it&#146;s ok 
with me&#148; said Washu.

&#147;Thank you Miss Washu for doing this for me&#148; Said Arial who let go of 
Washu.

&#147;Its no probablem Arial, really, so um, you want to open the door?&#148; 
said Washu who gave a little chuckle.

&#147;Oh...yeah, sorry just thinking of something there...&#148;said Arial with 
a little blush going across her face. She went it to her jacket and 
pulled out her keys and began to put it through the keyholes and began 
to turn it. Soon the door opened, and they both went inside the room 
and closed the door.

------------------------------------------------------------

NEXT DAY (SATURDAY)

The storm was over, and in Arial&#146;s room, and on her bed there slept 
Washu and Arial. Washu laying down straight on her back putting one 
arm around the other girl who is snuggled up to Washu and curled up in 
a ball. Arial put her right arm over Washu, underneath her breasts. 
Washu put her other arm above her head. The rays shown out of the 
window and hit its shininess on top of Arial&#146;s face, which she woke up 
too. She opened her eyes slowly and fluttered them a bit, when she was 
finally fully awake she looked up and saw Washu still fast a sleep 
next to her.

&lt;She looks so nice&#133;&gt; thought Arial. After that thought Washu slowly 
began too wake up. After her eyes fluttered a bit, she turned around 
to see the young girl next to her.

&#147;Good morning Miss Washu&#148; said Arial with a smile.

&#147;Good morning Arial and please, just call me Washu ok?&#148; Said Washu 
smiling in return.

&#147;OK, thanks Washu, um so had a nice sleep?&#148; Said Arial who got up and 
out of the bed.

&#147;Yes thank you Arial, so, where do you came form?&#148; said Washu who got 
up and sitting down at the edge of the bed.

&#147;I came form another planet, Tiex, my home planet&#148; said Arial who went 
of to the kitchen to make some breakfast and some tea.

&#147;Tiex, I heard of that planet, its mostly technology over there. The 
people there are incredibly smart, what brings you over here?&#148; said 
Washu crossing her legs.

&#147;Well, I came here because here on Juri, I heard that the Science 
academe is the best in the whole universe for learning science. Yeah 
of course my home planet has good science schools but the people who 
make technology there has came here to learn every thing about 
science. So that&#146;s why I came here.&#148; Said Arial who was making some 
eggs and bacon and tea.

&#147;Oh I see, so you don&#146;t know many places around here then?&#148; Said Washu 
smelling the food.

&#147;Yeah I guess&#133;&#148;said Arial.

&#147;Well then, its Saturday, and I was thinking to go out for the 
night&#133;so I was wondering if you would like to join me, I promise there 
won&#146;t be a thunder storm tonight.&#148; Said Washu with a smile.

Arial was giving a little chuckle at this and said &#147;Sure why not? 
Maybe it will get my mind off of some things.&#148; Said Arial

&#147;Good, its my treat, it will be fun&#148; said Washu.

&#147;Ok then&#148; said Arial.

------------------------------------------------------------

LATER THAT NIGHT

Washu was walking down the hall to Arial&#146;s room. She was wearing a 
long dress that stopped at her ankles, a long split that starts at her 
side, underneath her waist and all the way down. She was wearing high 
heal shoes about four inches high, and it was a shoe that has straps 
going across the foot and a buckle at the side of the ankle bone. The 
dress was black and had a rose pattern on top of her left breast. And 
was wearing a black cardigan, full sleeve. And was holding a short 
purse with a handle. She finally reached Arial&#146;s room. Taking a breath 
and sorting out her dress for some reason she didn&#146;t even knew and 
knock on the door twice. After a couple of seconds Arial opened the 
door. Washu gasped at how Arial looked. She was wearing a short tight 
dress that stopped just above her knees. There was a dragon pattern 
starting on her stomach and going up towards her right breast. Wearing 
high heels shoes as well, black as well. And also she was wearing a 
plane leather jacket that stops at her waist. She was carrying a mall 
bag that you can carry on your back.

&#147;Hello Washu&#133;Washu? &#133; Washu!&#148; Said Arial who was looking at Washu who 
was looking straight at Arial but wasn&#146;t blinking at all.

&#147;Huh?&#133;Oh sorry Arial, just gazed out there.&#148; Said Washu, a bit 
embarrassed about that, and showing a little blush.

&#147;Oh don&#146;t worry about it, so where are we going then?&#148; said Arial, 
locking the door and began walking with Washu.

&#147;It&#146;s a surprise, and I think you will like it&#148; said Washu who opened 
the door for Arial to go out the building.

------------------------------------------------------------

IN THE CITY

&#147;Wow&#133;its really packed in the streets in the nights&#133;&#148; said Arial who 
looked side to side.

&#147;Yeah it does&#148; said Washu, looking at the young girl next to her. &lt;She 
looks so nice, that jerk, I can&#146;t believe he dumped her, well he can 
rot in hell for making her hurt so much&gt; 

&#147;So Washu, what&#146;s surprise then?&#148; said Arial looking at Washu.

&#147;Ok I was wondering if you would like to go to Karaoke first? And then 
dinner at this wonderful place that has Japanese food, and then a nice 
walk through this park I had in mind?&#148; said Washu.

&#147;That sounds wonderful! I can&#146;t wait!&#148; said Arial with a smile.

&#147;Thanks, so I guess Karaoke first.&#148; Said Washu returning the smile.

They went to the karaoke first. They both had a good time there, both 
them scored the same, 27,which both of them weren&#146;t very happy with 
that. After about two hours of singing, they both had a good laugh at 
each other singing. After that they went to the restaurant that Washu 
said, it turned out they both like the food very much. After the nice 
meal they had, they went off to take the nice walk to a special park 
that Washu had in mind.

&#147;So where&#146;s the park that you had in mind Washu?&#148; said Arial looking 
at Washu.

&#147;Just wait, you soon see&#148; said Washu with a little smirk.

------------------------------------------------------------

AT THE PARK

&#147;Wow&#133;it&#146;s so beautiful&#133;&#148; said Arial looking around the park while 
walking with Washu.

&#147;Yeah it is, but this is nothing compared where I&#146;m gone to take you.&#148; 
Said Washu taking Arial&#146;s hand and lead her to where she was taking 
her too. Arial was infact blushing a bit at the warm feel of the other 
women&#146;s hand.

&lt;She feels so warm, and her skin is so smooth&#133;I wonder&#133;if she has 
anyone special in her life&#133;if not&#133;I might have a chance&#133;&gt; thought 
Arial, taking a quick glance it Washu, she smiled to her self

&#147;Ah, where here.&#148; Said Washu looking around and then at Arial.

&#147;Cool&#133;&#148; said Arial while looking around. There was a small area 
surrounded by tall trees in the middle there was not too small or not 
too tall of a fountain. The fountain had two people holding each 
other, water coming out of their eyes; it showed that they were 
crying. &#147;It looks so&#133;beautiful&#133;&#148; said Arial who was in fact was in 
front of Washu and looking at the statue. 

&#147;Yeah, it is, I come here some times too relax. It really shows me how 
nature is really beautiful.&#148; Said Washu who was behind Arial.

&#147;Yeah, nature is really beautiful, tell me, how did you find this 
place?&#148; said Arial, still looking at the statue.

&#147;My friend found this place, and she took me one night, and she told 
me this story that I will never forget about this statue.&#148; Said Washu 
next to Arial and looking at the statue then at the night sky. &#147;The 
full moon is out.&#148; Said Washu.

&#147;Yeah, so tell me, what&#146;s the story?&#148; said Arial who looked at Washu.

&#147;She told me that if you make a wish with the one you love, it will 
come true if you believe it enough. And all so she said the people who 
made this statue loved each other very much but there family forced 
them to end their relationship because they where girls. One moved to 
another planet and the other moved to a different planet. They 
couldn&#146;t live without each other so they soon got depressed, didn&#146;t 
talk to no one, stop eating, doing anything and soon, they ended their 
lives.&#148; Said Washu, looking at the statue.

&#147;That&#146;s so sad&#133;forced to be apart because they were girls&#133;&#148;said Arial 
who was feeling sorry for the couple.

&#147;Yes, I know&#133;but I think they are happy now, together in the after 
life.&#148; Said Washu who notice the tear on Arial&#146;s face. &#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;Its just that, I really miss him, but I can&#146;t go back to him because 
he doesn&#146;t want me anymore&#133;and I think&#133;theres no one for me out 
there.&#148; Said Arial who burst out crying. Washu looked at her then at 
the statue. She walked over to Arial and holds her in her arms.

&#147;Arial, don&#146;t think like that, there is always someone for someone, 
you me and everybody.&#148; Said Washu who was stroking Arial&#146;s hair.

&#147;Thank you, * sniffs *&#148; Said Arial, she lifted up and looked at Washu 
straight in the eyes.

&#147;No probablem&#148; said Washu, who looked up at the sky and so did Arial.

&#147;The stars are really beautiful tonight&#148; said Arial.

&#147;Not as beautiful as you&#133;&#148; said Washu with a smile. At this Arial 
gasped at this and looked at Washu straight in the eye.

&#147;Washu&#133;&#148; Then smiled and then moved in closer and so did Washu, soon 
there lips meet. It was the most passionate kiss they have ever had. 
But soon they parted.

&#147;I guess that my wish came true.&#148; Said Arial.

&#147;And so did mine&#133;&#148; said Washu. Both of them still in each other&#146;s 
arms, and looking at the sky together.

After that night, they enjoyed their time together. They haven&#146;t told 
anyone yet about their relationship. And most of the time they haven&#146;t 
been apart, until one day that changed their lives forever&#133;

------------------------------------------------------------

AFTER SIX MONTHS 

Arial was looking for Washu because she had a call form home that her 
mother was very sick, and there fore Arial told them she will come and 
see her.

After about two minuets later, Arial finally found Washu coming out of 
her classroom.

&#147;Hey Washu, I need to tell you something&#148; said Arial standing in front 
of her lover.

&#147;Sure, what is it love.&#148; Said Washu, who started walking with Arial.

&#147;Well, it&#146;s about my mother, she&#146;s very sick and my dad already booked 
a ticket for me to go and see her for a couple of weeks.&#148; Said Arial 
looking at Washu.

&#147;Oh, I see, when&#146;s the flight?&#148; said Washu looking back at her.

&#147;Well, its tomorrow&#133;&#148; said Arial 

&#147;Ok then, I come and drop you off k?&#148; said Washu giving a smile at her 
lover.

&#147;Thanks Washu!&#148; Arial gave her a nice tight hug and a peck on the 
cheek and went off to pack.

&#147;Be ready by 8:00 am ok!&#148; Arial said running off and gave a wave.

And Washu waved back and smiled, and began to walk off to the other 
direction.

------------------------------------------------------------

AT THE AIRPORT

Arial and Washu was in front of the docking post where different 
airplanes where going to different planets. They looked around and saw 
the plane about to take off to her home planet, Tiex, and they began 
to walk off to it. Soon they where in front of the booth where two 
staff members checked the passenger&#146;s tickets.

&#147;Its nearly time to leave, I guess I better go now.&#148; Said Arial facing 
Washu.

&#147;Yeah, you don&#146;t want too miss your flight.&#148; Said Washu smiling at 
her.

&#147;No I don&#146;t, so I guess I see you in two weeks then?&#148; said Arial 
smiling at her as well.

&#147;Call me ok?&#148; said Washu.

&#147;Will do! I better go now.&#148; Said Arial who gave Washu a tight hug, and 
a kiss on the lips. Then she picked up her bags and went off. The 
staff checked her ticket and let her go through. She put one bag down 
and waved at Washu and gave her a smile, and then picked up her bag 
again and went in side the plane.

HALF AN HOUR LATER INSIDE OF WASHU&#146;S ROOM

Washu closed her door behind her and put her keys on the table and her 
jacket. She went over to her sofa and kicked off her shoes and then 
turned the TV on with her remote. She sighed and changed the channels. 
She stopped at the news. It was about a crash. The reporter said

&#147;I&#146;m here today at an incident that has happened at the south coast 
out side of the Juri&#146;s star. A shower of meteors hit the plane, and 
there four, the engines caught in fire and reacted with the airplane&#146;s 
fuel. Sadly, no one has survived, to this we will all remember the 
incident; the airplane that has crashed was going to the planet Tiex&#133;&#148;

END OF FLASHBACK

------------------------------------------------------------

Washu was still sitting in the floating red cushion. She still had the 
stained face with her tears. She typed a few commands on her halo 
computer and within in a second a little black hole appeared and came 
out was a Picher. She grabbed it and looked at it. It was a Picher of 
her and Arial sitting in the photo both. She still could hear the rain 
and the thunderstorm out side. One of her tears had hit the photo at 
the side. Her tears still rolling down her cheeks and still looking at 
the Picher. She kissed the Picher and said &#147;My dear sweet love; I miss 
you&#133;&#148;
