<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 7 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/onceagain-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Splash! With a happy little sigh Kitsune Konno settled
into the water, the sandy blonde haired woman relaxing
in the hot springs after a long day&#39;s work in and
around the Hinata Cafe. She was faintly surprised not
to see anyone else out here in the water, but she
expected that the others would be coming soon.

&quot;And the turtle really flies?&quot; Ami Mizuno said as she
emerged from the mists, her short blue hair giving her
a boyish look.

Anthy Himemiya chuckled softly, the dusky skinned
woman saying, &quot;Yes, it surprised me too.&quot; Her violet
hair was tied up, a few strands falling into her eyes,
and she looked comfortable in her nudity. &quot;Hello
Kitsune,&quot; she nodded in greeting.

&quot;Yo,&quot; Kitsune raised a saucer of sake in greeting, her
bottles sitting in a little wooden bucket that floated
beside her.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Rei Hino said, the black haired girl standing
protectively by Ami&#39;s side.

&quot;I see you haven&#39;t gambled away the cafe&#39;s profits
yet,&quot; Anthy teased gently as she settled in the water,
her breasts bobbing gently.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ami looked startled from where she and Rei were
easing into the steaming water.

Kitsune gave Anthy a scolding look, &quot;Don&#39;t be giving
them ideas, I&#39;ve mostly given that up.&quot;

&quot;And we were quite surprised by that,&quot; Motoko said,
her long black hair flowing around her, her full
breasts hidden behind a modest towel. Oddly she still
carried her katana even into the baths, setting it
beside her as she shed her towel and sat in the water
nearby.

&quot;You all seem to know each other fairly well,&quot; Rei
noted quietly.

&quot;I&#39;ve only been here a few months,&quot; Anthy sat back,
sighing softly in contentment as the heat eased sore
muscles. In addition to her fortune telling in town
she had helped clean up at the new inn, and she felt
pretty tired. &quot;But I understand Motoko and Kitsune are
full time residents.&quot;

&quot;Well, I was until I moved over to the cafe full
time,&quot; Kitsune corrected.

&quot;Kitsune and I,&quot; Motoko nodded, &quot;Su, Mutsumi and
Shinobu have all lived here for awhile. Ema moved in
recently, and Kanako lived here for awhile, left, and
then came back.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a very,&quot; Ami gave them all a thoughtful look,
&quot;family like feel to this women&#39;s dorm, it&#39;s very
pleasant.&quot;

Kitsune laughed softly, &quot;Somehow I can&#39;t quite see any
of us as father figures.&quot;

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t know,&quot; Anthy stretched gracefully, &quot;Motoko
comes across as quite manly.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Motoko blurted, blushing.

&quot;That might have been a bit much,&quot; Rei noted, seeing
the look on Motoko&#39;s face. Oddly Kitsune looked almost
as upset as her, but with more of a... jealous
expression.

&quot;No insult intended,&quot; Anthy said to them gently, &quot;in
fact you remind me of someone I once liked... a great
deal.&quot;

Motoko relaxed a bit at that, &quot;Of course, I
understand.&quot; A little smile quirked her lips, &quot;It
seems I still have some issues with my femininity.&quot;

Oddly Kitsune still had a faintly antagonistic look on
her face as she studied Anthy. &quot;So,&quot; she waved her
sake bottle for emphasis, &quot;it was a girl you liked?&quot;

&quot;Kitsune,&quot; Shinobu scolded as the black haired young
woman said as she emerged from the mists, Su and Ema
behind her. Her long black hair swirled as she hit the
water, sliding beneath the steaming fluid.

Kitsune subsided a bit, &quot;All right, that might have
been a bit much.&quot;

&quot;It was a woman,&quot; Anthy surprised them by saying, &quot;her
name is Tenjou Utena.&quot;

Su looked at Anthy eagerly, the dusky skinned blonde
leaning forward a bit. &quot;So were you dating?&quot; she
asked.

Anthy smiled slightly, &quot;Something like that, yes.&quot;

&quot;And.. you two are separated?&quot; Ema asked, the youngest
girl&#39;s antenna like strands of hair bouncing a bit.

&quot;Yes, we went out separate ways several years ago,&quot;
Anthy said, aware that the whole group of women were
watching her intently. With a sigh she added, &quot;We left
things between us frustratingly unresolved... and I
want to see her again.&quot;

Kitsune and Motoko exchanged a silent look of
communication then Kitsune asked, &quot;You want some
help?&quot;

&quot;I bet I could come up with something,&quot; Su nodded.

Timidly Ema continued, &quot;I could start a net search,
maybe...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d do that for me?&quot; Anthy said, feeling just a bit
surprised.

Shinobu smiled back, &quot;What are friends for?&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Anthy smiled, reaching up to wipe at her
eyes.

With a surprising degree of tact Su changed the
subject. &quot;I saw someone with Kanako,&quot; she said, &quot;do
you think we might have a new resident?&quot;

Earlier that day Kanako Urashima lead a woman along
the hall, the black haired young woman looking like a
shadow in her all black clothes. &quot;Welcome to our dorm,
Miss Masaki,&quot; she said as she lead her to the
manager&#39;s room.

Tennyo Masaki wore a comfortable off-gray skirt and
white blouse, looking much like a active business
woman. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, &quot;it looks like a
comfortable place.&quot;

&quot;We like to think so,&quot; Kanako opened the door and they
went inside, her pet cat leaping up to her shoulder
with the ease of long practice.

&quot;So who&#39;s the new blood?&#39; Kuro the black cat asked
Kanako, peering at Tennyo curiously from his usual
perch.

&quot;Hush,&quot; Kanako scolded as she reached up to scratch
behind his ears.

Tennyo seemed quite unfazed by a talking cat, calmly
taking her seat by the low table with a unusual degree
of grace. &quot;The place looks fine for my needs,&quot; she
said gravely then flashed a smile, &quot;and the rent is
cheap.&quot;

&quot;I was surprised a older woman wanted to move here,&quot;
Kanako noted, though in truth it was hard to guess her
age. On one hand she seemed mature, coming across like
a dignified older lady, but her body seemed to glow
with youth.

&quot;I only recently returned to Japan,&quot; Tennyo explained,
&quot;after living abroad and gaining my engineering
degree. I wanted to live away from my family, but I&#39;m
not sure I&#39;m comfortable enough to live on my own.&quot;

&quot;And the dorm will be a nice middle ground,&quot; Kanako
nodded slightly.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Tennyo smiled.

Kanako gracefully poured them both some tea. &quot;And you
mentioned that you&#39;re trained as an engineer?&quot; she
asked curiously.

Tennyo looked faintly amused by the shameless probing.
&quot;Yes I am,&quot; she nodded, &quot;I&#39;ve made arrangements with a
firm to work from home. I&#39;ll be using my laptop and
modem mostly, with occasional visits to the office.&quot;

They shared their tea, talking about minor things for
a few more minutes. &quot;If this dorm suits you,&quot; Kanako
said gravely, &quot;I can have the papers ready for you to
sign today.&quot;

&quot;You think I&#39;m suitable, then?&quot; Tennyo asked
teasingly.

&quot;Very much so,&quot; Kanako answered calmly.

&quot;Then yes, I&#39;d like to become a resident,&quot; Tennyo
nodded.

To be continued....

Notes: Tennyo Masaki is the big sister of Tenchi
Masaki of Tenchi Muyo, a new character introduced in
the latest OVAs. In her case &quot;living abroad&quot; means
outer space, having spent time on Jurai and several
other worlds.</pre>
