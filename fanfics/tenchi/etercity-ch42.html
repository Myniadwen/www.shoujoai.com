<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 42 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/etercity-ch41.html">Back to Part 41</a><pre>Queen Serenity blinked at the scientist, her white
gold hair tied up in it&#39;s usual buns. &quot;What do you
mean,&quot; the queen leaned forward on her throne as she
asked, &quot;you can&#39;t seal off the hazardous area?&quot;

Rachel Guardian looked sheepish as the redhead
consulted her notes, her breasts bouncing a little in
the cutouts of her clothes. The new fashion of near
nudity had nearly run it&#39;s course, but the clothes
would linger for a time yet. &quot;It appears,&quot; she said
reluctantly, &quot;that the springs at Jusenkyo mystically
resist any attempt at sealing them.&quot;

&quot;Incredible,&quot; King Endymion muttered, &quot;how...?&quot;

Kaede Guardian sighed, the black haired older girl
pushing up her glasses. &quot;The springs there in China
seem to rise up through any barrier we place,&quot;
Rachel&#39;s wife explained to them respectfully,
&quot;Ferro-concrete, Omni-steel, neo-titanium, it doesn&#39;t
seem to matter what we use, it all failed.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Queen Serenity frowned, &quot;it looks like we&#39;ll
have to go with option two.&quot;

Sailor Mercury stepped forward from where she had been
waiting, the blue haired woman nodding firmly. &quot;If we
can&#39;t interfere with the spring directly,&quot; she said
briskly, &quot;we can erect a force field over the area and
prevent any more curses.&quot;

Rachel smiled in apology, &quot;Ma&#39;am, in may not be that
simple.&quot; Gesturing she said, &quot;The locals have sent a
representative.&quot;

&quot;Send them in,&quot; Serenity ordered curiously.

A few moments later a eerily familiar redhead entered,
dressed in a simple chinese blouse and shorts. Both
rulers gazed at her in shock, stunned by the perfect
resemblance to their long dead friend Ranma Saotome.

Endymion nodded thoughtfully, &quot;Cursed by the spring of
drowned girl?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; she smiled, &quot;my name is Yuji Tendo, and I&#39;m
the current keeper of the shrine nearby the spring.&quot;

&quot;And you wish to prevent us from sealing off the
springs?&quot; Serenity asked, wishing she had a cup of hot
water on hand to end the effects of the curse.

Yuji smiled as she took a flask of water and splashed
herself, shifting visibly from a redheaded girl to a
taller brown haired young man. Putting the container
away he said. &quot;Yes ma&#39;am, the springs are of enormous
cultural and spiritual significance.&quot;

&quot;Apparently,&quot; Rachel said quietly from where she stood
near the throne, &quot;the local amazon tribe uses a
temporary form of Spring of Drowned Man to...
procreate.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Endymion blinked.

&quot;And,&quot; Yuji added, &quot;adherents of the Saotome school of
Anything Goes martial arts randomly dunk themselves in
a spring as a test to see if they can cope with the
cursed form.&quot;

&quot;Seriously?&quot;Sailor Mercury frowned slightly.

&quot;The shrine we maintain at the spring helps control
access,&quot; Yuji informed them, &quot;and we have warning
signs posted in multiple languages, just in case.&quot;

&quot;Like the infamous Genma,&quot; Serenity looked amused.

Yuji smiled, &quot;Exactly.&quot;

Turning to Rachel and Kaede Serenity wondered, &quot;If
there any way to be sure the springs won&#39;t work their
way around a force bubble too?&quot;

Rachel opened her hands helplessly, &quot;To be honest
ma&#39;am, we don&#39;t know. Whatever power is feeding the
springs, it clearly wants them to continue to exist.&quot;

Endymion leaned over to whisper in Serenity&#39;s ear,
then the blonde haired woman smiled slightly. &quot;I think
for the time being we&#39;ll monitor the situation,&quot; she
announced, &quot;and if things change we&#39;ll revisit the
issue.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, my Queen,&quot; Yuji bowed respectfully before
he, Rachel and Kaede all left the smaller throne room.

&quot;Sorry, Ami,&quot; Serenity quietly addressed her friend,
&quot;I know you&#39;d have preferred a seal of some kind.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Ami smiled wryly, &quot;I know how
unpredictable magic can be.&quot;

Meanwhile, across the city a elevator hissed open as a
Major Motoko Kusanagi emerged, her blue0black hair
flowing around her face as she checked out the
hallway. &quot;All clear,&quot; the beautiful cyborg reported.

Minako Aino shook her head, the slightly smaller
blonde following her out. &quot;You don&#39;t seriously expect
a ambush, do you love?&quot; she asked gently.

Motoko slid down her shades a bit to give her lover a
look, &quot;Better not to take chances, hmm?&quot; Pushing her
sunglasses back up they went to the corner suite of
their quarry, &quot;Alucard confirms that she&#39;s home.&quot;

&quot;He didn&#39;t get spotted again, did he?&quot; Minako wondered
as she tidied up her simple blue sun dress. She
thought about wearing a business suit, but figured
something a little less authoritarian might be wise.

&quot;He&#39;s fairly annoyed with himself,&quot; Motoko sounded am
used, &quot;and I doubt he&#39;ll let it happen again. &quot; She
raised her hand to knock, &quot;Should I...?&quot;

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Minako said, taking a steadying breath.

After the knock it only took a few seconds for the
door to open, but both women blinked in confusion on
the sight greeting them. The redheaded young woman&#39;s
hair was a mess, and she wore a hastily thrown on
robe. &quot;Yes?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Minako felt herself smiling as she suspected
what they might have interrupted, &quot;I&#39;m looking for Jun
Fudoh?&quot;

The young lady frowned, &quot;May I ask who&#39;s calling?&quot;

Motoko stepped up, &quot;Just tell her Motoko and friend,
please.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; the young lady proceeded to close the door in
their faces.

&quot;Who was that?&quot; Minako whispered, smiling.

&quot;Nadesico Kinomoto,&quot; Motoko whispered back, &quot;the only
daughter of Sakura and Tomoyo. You haven&#39;t met?&quot;

&quot;Sakura&#39;s mostly kept her out of the public eye,&quot;
Minako shrugged.

After a few moments Jun Fudoh reopened the door, the
tall woman looking nearly as rumpled as Nadesico was.
Her eyes swept over the two of them as she said, &quot;I
was expecting Motoko, but not you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Motoko asked, looking at Jun warily.

&quot;I thought we should talk,&quot; Minako shrugged. A smile
tugged on her lips, &quot;We aren&#39;t interrupting anything,
are we?&quot;

Jun&#39;s lips pressed flat with annoyance. &quot;My friend
stayed late last night,&quot; she said harshly, &quot;she took
the bed, I used the couch.&quot;

Minako sighed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I was trying to be funny.&quot;

Jun relaxed a little, studying the two women warily.
&quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much to talk about,&quot; she said
dryly.

&quot;How about,&quot; Motoko offered, &quot;all is forgiven, please
come home?&quot;

Jun gave her a look as Minako snorted. &quot;I thought I
was the goofball here?&quot; she said, looking up at
Motoko.

&quot;Sorry, couldn&#39;t resist,&quot; Motoko shrugged.

Jun did her best to hide a smile.

&quot;Seriously,&quot; Minako said as she looked at Jun, &quot;I came
to apologize.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Jun seemed surprised at that.

&quot;I was well aware that you had issues with the Sailor
Senshi when I asked Motoko and Alucard to recruit
you,&quot; Minako said, &quot;I should have been up front with
you, rather than keeping it a secret who I was.&quot;

Jun frowned, studying Minako. She seemed sincere, but
Jun also knew that you didn&#39;t get a job like Minako&#39;s
without learning to lie when needed. Besides, Minako
almost had to come clean at this point, considering
how much Jun already knew. Still there was a basic
feeling of honesty about her...

&quot;Let&#39;s talk about it later,&quot; Jun finally suggested. A
slight smile, &quot;I&#39;d invite you in, but...&quot;

&quot;Perfectly understandable,&quot; Motoko smiled slightly.

&quot;Same park you saw us meet with Alucard, tomorrow at
noon?&quot; Minako suggested.

&quot;I&#39;ll be there,&quot; Jun agreed.
