<h1>Love is Eternal (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kakaroto.html">Kakaroto</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note:

Okay, normally this is where I would introduce the fic, but, seeing as 
how it&#39;s a special occasion (meaning this is dedicated to my good 
friend, Damien Stryker, who was my chief inspiration), I&#39;ll let the 
Juraiian Royal Guardians, Azaka and Kamidake, take over that part.

AZAKA: Thank you for this dubious honor.

KAMIDAKE: Yes. We will most certainly try our best to do a proper 
introduction.

AZAKA: This is a tale of love...

KAMIDAKE: As if you couldn&#39;t tell by the title.

AZAKA: As I was saying, this is a tale of love in a place where one 
would almost never expect to find it.

KAMIDAKE: Yes, it certainly is unexpected.

Um, well, yeah, I guess that&#39;ll do. (Mental Note: Fire Royal 
Guardians.) At least they didn&#39;t give away the plot too much. As for 
the standard disclaimer, I in no way own any character that you have 
ever seen in the Tenchi Muyo! Anime series (yes, I&#39;m aware that there 
are three of them) or in the movies (even though I&#39;m not exactly sure 
how many of those there are). Oh, and in case anyone is wondering, 
this takes place in the Tenchi Universe series (mainly &#39;cause it&#39;s my 
favorite), but will have some alternate-universe elements in it 
(you&#39;ll see what I mean). Oh, and this is my first-ever Tenchi Muyo 
Lemon, so don&#39;t flame me too harshly.

**********************

It all started on an abnormal day at the Masaki house. By abnormal, I 
mean it was quiet. There were no explosions, no starships crashing 
into the lake, no screaming, nothing.

Ryoko was laying on the roof and had managed to fall asleep in the 
noon sun while waiting for Tenchi to return home from school. Ayeka 
was sprawled on the couch reading one of Katsuhito&#39;s books on ancient 
swords. Sasami was in the kitchen preparing lunch while Ryo-Ohki 
stalked the carrot basket. Mihoshi and Kiyone had been called back to 
Galaxy Police HQ for a routine efficiency analysis. Nobuyuki was at 
the office, Washu was in her lab, and Katsuhito was tending to his 
duties at the shrine atop the hill. No-one complained about the 
oh-so-rare peace that had descended upon the house, but later they 
would wish that they had enjoyed it more thoroughly.

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; A blood-curling scream from the 
supply closet-turned-laboratory and the semi-tall, semi-mad genius 
Washu erupted from the door, slamming it behind her.

&quot;What happened, Miss Washu?&quot; Ayeka asked, placing the book on the 
coffee table.

&quot;One of my dimensional portals opened, and a creature like I&#39;ve never 
laid eyes upon before invaded my lab!&quot;

Sasami, walking out of the kitchen, asked, &quot;Um, Washu? Did this 
&#39;creature&#39; have ten arms, six legs and look vaguely humanoid except 
for the three heads, reddish skin color and being fifty feet tall?&quot;

&quot;Why, yes. How did you ever guess that?&quot; Washu asked the young 
princess.

&quot;Because it wasn&#39;t just your lab it invaded!!!!&quot; Katsuhito said, 
running towards the house while being chased by one of the many-limbed 
beings.

Sighing, Ayeka walked out the front door. &quot;I guess we have to do 
everything around here. Azaka! Kamidake!&quot; As the princess voiced her 
command, the two Royal Guardians appeared beside her, poised for 
battle. However, before Ayeka could tell them what to do, one of the 
creatures smacked them away with some of its arms. They flew upward 
and somewhat to the south, and Katsuhito could swear he heard them 
yell, &quot;We&#39;re sorry, Princess!&quot; before they were out of sight.

Ayeka, meanwhile, had charged up her force-field, but, with three of 
the monsters hammering it with their arms, she knew she couldn&#39;t hold 
it forever. Just as she thought she was doomed, a trio of red energy 
beams hit one of the creatures square in what passed for the chest, 
knocking it back and startling the other two into stopping their 
attack. Looking up to where she guessed the beams came from, Ayeka saw 
Ryoko hovering in the air, dressed in her black-and-red combat suit. 
With a smirk, the ex-pirate landed beside her rival.

&quot;You okay, Princess?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yes. Thank you, Ryoko.&quot; For some reason Ayeka hadn&#39;t been able to 
explain, Ryoko had been fighting with her less and less. Stranger 
still, the other woman actually seemed to care about the First 
Princess of Jurai.

Nodding her head in the direction of the five creatures, Ryoko asked, 
&quot;Shall we?&quot;

With a smirk that would make Nagi proud, Ayeka replied, &quot;Yes. Let&#39;s 
give them some payback for ruining our quiet day.&quot; With that, Ryoko 
formed two energy swords in her hands and Ayeka charged up enough 
energy to wipe out Beijing. The two women charged, their slashes and 
blasts driving the interdimensional creatures backwards in the 
direction of the lake. When one of them lost its balance and went 
careening into the water, courtesy of Ayeka, it seemed to dissolve in 
the crystal-clear liquid.

&quot;Somehow, I expected these things to put up more of a fight.&quot; Ryoko 
said, using a roundhouse kick to send one of the beings into the lake 
and watched it writhe as the water work its deadly wonders on the 
beast.

&quot;Yes. It is somewhat of a disappointment. But, I suppose not every 
opponent has to be as strong as Kagato.&quot; Katsuhito observed, using his 
bokken to trip one of the aliens into the pond.

Charging an energy blast of her own, Washu blasted a hole in the torso 
of the being nearest her, giggling as it, too, joined its companions 
in their watery grave. &quot;Four down, one to go.&quot;

&quot;This one&#39;s mine!&quot; Sasami said, stepping out of the house and holding 
up a huge laser cannon. &quot;Those things disturbed me while I was 
cooking, and now our lunch is RUINED!&quot; Taking aim, she pulled the 
trigger, sending a green bolt at the last monster, causing it to rear 
back before toppling into the lake.

&quot;I guess that takes care of them, wouldn&#39;t you say, Ryoko?&quot; Ayeka 
said, dropping her force-field.

&quot;Um, I wouldn&#39;t count on that, Princess. You&#39;re forgetting about the 
one in Washu&#39;s lab.&quot; Ryoko reminded her.

&quot;ACK! That&#39;s right! Who knows what havoc that thing could be wreaking 
on my inventions!&quot; Washu exclaimed, running for the house. Before she 
could reach the door, however, the last of the aliens burst out of her 
lab and onto the lawn, destroying half the house in the process.

In a deep, earth-shaking voice, it said, &quot;Come to me, my demon 
brothers, and take revenge on these mortals!&quot; As the creature spoke 
these words, a red ooze began to seep out of the lake. It flowed 
across the grass like a river, making Katsuhito jump out of its path. 
When it reached the last demon, the ooze reared up and slammed into 
the creature&#39;s chest.

Ayeka could not believe what she was seeing. As more and more of the 
ooze hit the alien, the creature began to grow. Soon, it was taller 
than Tokyo tower. &quot;Now you shall feel the full power of Tarok Manda, 
King of Shunrah!&quot;

&quot;Ayeka,&quot; Ryoko began, &quot;I hate to tell you this, but we&#39;re doomed.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean by that, Ryoko? What kind of power does this thing 
have?&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve never actually laid eyes on it before today. That&#39;s why I 
didn&#39;t recognize it. But Manda and his army of demons made the stuff I 
did look like child&#39;s play, and I ain&#39;t talking about a movie starring 
a possessed doll.

&quot;Tarok Manda was also known as the Planet Killer. His demons would use 
interdimensional gateways to find planets with valuable natural 
resources - like oil and coal on this planet - and he would break the 
crust apart to get whatever it was he was after. This would go on for 
however long Manda was getting what he wanted. Then, after the 
resources were gone, he&#39;d jump in his portal and look for another 
planet. Shortly after that, the planet that he mined dry would break 
apart, killing anyone who was left.&quot;

Sasami was stunned. &quot;But, why would someone do that?&quot;

Ryoko sighed before answering. &quot;Not even Nagi could find that out. 
Some said that he was building a vast fleet of warships to conquer the 
galaxy, but he wouldn&#39;t need it with his powers. The most likely guess 
was that he was using the materials he stripped from other planets to 
make one for his people somewhere in an unexplored part of the 
galaxy.&quot;

&quot;It matters not what his reasons are,&quot; Katsuhito said. &quot;It only 
matters that we end his reign of terror.&quot;

&quot;I agree, Lord Katsuhito,&quot; Washu said, pulling up her holographic 
computer. &quot;But I think we&#39;ll need some added insurance.&quot; Pressing a 
button, she caused a huge dimensional pocket to open, revealing five 
Gundam-type machines.

&quot;Mother, what are those things?&quot; Ryoko asked, pointing finger at the 
battlesuits.

With an oh-so-kawaii smile, Washu walked up to the first in the line. 
It was the color of Sasami&#39;s eyes and looked a lot like a scorpion. 
&quot;Basically, these are Mobile Suits. I became quite fascinated with 
Gundam Wing, so I decided to try my hand at building some of these 
puppies.&quot; Pointing to the arachnoid before her, she said, &quot;This one is 
called Scorpio. I built its control systems with Lady Ayeka in mind.&quot;

Pointing to the next in line, she said, &quot;The rest are named for and 
modeled after mythical creatures. I call this one Centaur.&quot; Indeed, 
that was what it was shaped like. With a coloring that made it seem 
like it was made of pure silver, Washu explained this one was 
Katsuhito&#39;s.

The next three were Cerberus (Ryoko&#39;s), Pegasus (Sasami&#39;s) and 
Quetzelcoatl (Washu&#39;s). All stared in awe at the machines, but Ryoko 
was the one to ask the obvious question. &quot;Um, Mom? How are we supposed 
to work these things?&quot;

&quot;Why, that&#39;s simple, Ryoko. All you do is stand at the base and wait 
for the computer to lock onto your bio-signatures. After that, you&#39;ll 
be instantly transported to the control module. Just put on the helmet 
inside and you&#39;ll be able to control the Mobile Suit.&quot;

Sasami was the next to ask a question. &quot;Did you happen to make a 
replica of any of the Gundams?&quot;

Washu got a sad look on her face. &quot;Actually, Sasami, I wanted to, but 
then I found something called &#39;copyright infringement&#39; which 
prohibited me from making a replica of any of the Suits in that 
series. These, however, are my own design, and I can use them freely. 
Any more questions?&quot; After a short pause, she said, &quot;Alright! Everyone 
suit up!&quot;

Following Washu&#39;s instructions, everyone stood directly beneath the 
head of their machine and were beamed into the control center. Well, 
except for Ryoko. After several seconds of waiting, she just 
teleported into the seat.

&quot;All systems ready.&quot; Washu said as she activated the control systems 
on her winged serpent-like attack vehicle. After hearing four 
confirmations of battle readiness, she led the charge.

While Katsuhito used the Centaur&#39;s lance to keep the arms busy, Ayeka 
pinned down the legs with Scorpio&#39;s pincers and Ryoko utilized the 
claws of Cerberus to tear some of the armor-like skin from the torso 
of their adversary. Meanwhile, Washu snuck in from behind and used 
Quetzalcoatl&#39;s tail like a whip on Manda&#39;s spinal column. With Sasami 
flying up into the air and using the powerful wings of Pegesus to 
create a gail-force wind, the five warriors were ever-so-slowly 
pushing the &#39;Demon King&#39; to his watery grave.

&quot;NOOOO!&quot; Manda screamed as he began to sink. &quot;How could I be defeated 
by weaklings such as yourselves?&quot;

Washu, now outside of her battle machine, smirked and said, &quot;Simple. 
You never attacked the home of the galaxy&#39;s cutest genius.&quot; Then, 
looking at her companions, she added, &quot;Or some of it&#39;s strongest 
fighters.&quot;

Manda screamed in pain as the water dissolved him. &quot;I will be back. 
Mark my words, I will have my 
revenge!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!........&quot;

&quot;Well, he sure wasn&#39;t all he was cracked up to be.&quot; Ryoko said as the 
Mobile Suits disappeared.

&quot;I agree. Even Dr. Clay was stronger than this so-called King of 
Demons.&quot; After making a vain attempt to straighten her ruffled hair, 
Ayeka sighed and said, &quot;I&#39;m going to the onsen. Care to join me, 
Ryoko?&quot; She then pointed to the torn clothes and scarred body of the 
former pirate.

&quot;Sure. I could use a soak in a nice hot tub.&quot; Ryoko replied as the two 
walked towards the house. Then, they remembered something. Thanks to 
Manda, the house was only a foundation, and not much of one, at that.

&quot;Here.&quot; Washu said, tossing a small box at what was left of the Masaki 
household. There was a loud explosion, and the house was suddenly 
there again. &quot;I always keep a spare house stored in one of those 
micro-storage containers, just in case.&quot;

The two women said their thank-yous and walked into the house.

***********************

Inside the onsen, Ryoko phased out of her combat suit and put a small 
floating basket containing soap and shampoo into the water. She slid 
in up to her neck, enjoying the sensuous feelings the water gave her.

Ayeka, however, had always worn a bathing suit or a towel into the 
water and, not seeing either of these around, she was forced to strip 
naked. &#39;Fortunately&#39;, she thought, &#39;Ryoko isn&#39;t looking in my 
direction. Maybe she won&#39;t say anything.&#39; Once she had all her clothes 
off, Ayeka timidly stepped into the water.

As Ryoko looked over at Ayeka to start a conversation, she was shocked 
to see that the princess was nude. &quot;Decide to go au natural today, 
Ayeka?&quot; she asked with just a hint of playfulness.

Ayeka let out a &#39;harumph&#39; and replied, &quot;I had no other choice, Ryoko. 
My swimsuit is in my room, and there are no towels in here. I would 
greatly appreciate it if you didn&#39;t make fun of my body.&quot;

The next thing Ayeka knew, there was a pair of arms around her neck, 
two large breasts pressing into hers and she was staring into the 
golden eyes of Ryoko. &quot;Why would I make fun of something I desire so 
much, princess?&quot; she asked, a seductive tone in her voice.

&quot;Wha-what do you mean, Ryoko? I thought you were after Tenchi.&quot;

&quot;I am. But, there&#39;s nothing in the book that says a woman can&#39;t play 
both sides of the fence. That&#39;s why Nagi&#39;s after me. We used to date, 
but she was just too controlling for my liking. So, I left her. She 
swore she&#39;d get me back. Well, it looks like you and Tenchi managed to 
reel my heart in first.&quot;

&quot;Ryoko, I don&#39;t know what to say. Is this why you&#39;ve been so nice to 
me lately?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ayeka. It didn&#39;t happen all at once, but I eventually grew to 
love you just as much as I love Tenchi. I could barely stand to be 
around you without staring at you, and knowing I could never have 
you.&quot; Reluectantly, Ryoko pulled away. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I offended you. I 
just had to get that off my chest.&quot; With that, Ryoko rose up out of 
the water and began walking up the stone stairs. That is, until she 
felt a soft hand on her shoulder. Turning around, she found herself 
gazing into the compassionate violet eyes of Ayeka.

&quot;You saved my life today, Ryoko. What kind of princess would I be if I 
left a debt unpaid?&quot;

Ryoko was stunned. &quot;You mean......you would let me.......?&quot;

Ayeka sighed and said, &quot;Yes, Ryoko. If you want me so bad,&quot; she backed 
off a bit, opening her arms for Ryoko, &quot;take me.&quot;

With a smile on her face and a tear in the corner of one eye, Ryoko 
moved forward and embraced Ayeka. It was tentative at first, neither 
girl really sure about the situation, but, after a few moments passed, 
they grew more comfortable with it and they pressed closer together, 
Ayeka wrapping her arms around Ryoko&#39;s torso.

Now the two former enemies were so close together that their faces 
were only two inces apart. Ayeka could feel Ryoko&#39;s breasts pressing 
into her again, and, along with the warmth from inbewteen the pirate&#39;s 
legs, the feeling was turning her on. Pushing her inhibitions to the 
side, she leaned forward and captured Ryoko&#39;s lips with her own.

Needless to say, Ryoko was in heaven when one of her two objects of 
desire kissed her. However, being the way she is, she needed more. So, 
she moved her hands down Ayeka&#39;s back until they reached the soft 
curves of her buttocks, which she squeezed and massaged without mercy. 
This caused the princess to open her mouth, which allowed Ryoko to 
thrust her tongue in.

Ayeka was surprised at first, but eventually got used to it and began 
moving her tongue against Ryoko&#39;s while she moved her own hands 
downward and started giving her former rival the same massage she was 
receiving.

Reluctantly breaking the kiss, Ryoko said, &quot;Enough foreplay, princess. 
It&#39;s time to go to the main event.&quot; Lifting both herself and Ayeka out 
of the water, she landed them softly on a bamboo mat laid off to one 
side of the swimming pool-sized bathtub. She then began placing 
butterfly kisses along Ayeka&#39;s neck, trailing downward to kiss the 
breasts, pausing to suckle the nipples for a minute.

Now it was Ayeka&#39;s turn to be in heaven. On Jurai, it was a custom for 
a princess to sleep with the suitors her father brought before her, 
but none of them excited her as much as Ryoko did, nor did they do the 
things she was doing. The princess moaned as Ryoko sucked on one 
breast, taking as much of it into her mouth as possible, while her 
hand played with the other one. Then she alternated her hand and mouth 
so as not to neglect any part of the royal body she had been craving 
for months.

After playing with Ayeka&#39;s breasts for a few minutes, Ryoko began 
sliding down, planting kisses here and there, exciting her 
purple-haired lover even more. Finally, she reached the narrow slit 
and triangle of violet hair that marked the center of Ayeka&#39;s 
pleasure.

&quot;P-please, Ryoko,&quot; Ayeka said, barely able to contain her excitement. 
&quot;Don&#39;t make me wait any longer.&quot;

&quot;Who am I to argue with the Crown Princess of Jurai?&quot; With that, Ryoko 
plunged her tongue in, making Ayeka scream with pleasure. After a 
short two minutes, Ryoko had succeeded in giving Ayeka an orgasm, at 
the onset of which the princess screamed almost loud enough to break 
glass. With a gleam in her eye, Ryoko licked up all of the 
honey-flavored juices that spilled out of Ayeka&#39;s entrance.

After regaining her breath and her senses, Ayeka sat up and maneuvered 
Ryoko into a sitting position on one of the wooden benches in the 
room. Kneeling and using two fingers to open the pirate&#39;s folds, Ayeka 
shot her own tongue into the narrow space. Thoroughly satisfied by the 
sounds she was receiving from Ryoko, she raised her hands and began 
playing with her lover&#39;s breasts.

With the attention and pleasure the princess was giving her, Ryoko 
soon climaxed, giving Ayeka her sweet, tangy juices as a reward. Once 
she came down from her natural high, Ryoko stood up on somewhat wobbly 
legs and went to a potted plant in the far corner of the room, one of 
the few spots where there was very little light.

&quot;What are you doing over there, Ryoko?&quot; Ayeka asked. &quot;Come back to me, 
and we can explore this....desire of yours even further.&quot;

&quot;Relax, Ayeka. I&#39;m just getting something to further the pleasure.&quot; 
Ryoko fished around near the plant for a few seconds, then returned 
with a black bag in her hand.

&quot;What is that, Ryoko?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s something Mihoshi and Kiyone use when they&#39;re alone.&quot; With that, 
Ryoko reached into the back and pulled out a long, flexible, 
twin-headed dildo. &quot;This brings back memories. Nagi had something like 
this, only hers vibrated.&quot; Ryoko said in revelry. &quot;If only she hadn&#39;t 
turned into a total bitch....&quot;

Ayeka immediately knew what it was for, as she had used similar 
devices on Jurai inbetween suitor visits. But she had never seen one 
designed to be used by two women at once before. So, natuarally, she 
was excited by it. Snatching it out of Ryoko&#39;s hand, she jammed one 
end into herself and began thrusting it in and out her forcefully.

&quot;Hey, calm down, Princess.&quot; the pirate said, placing her hand over 
Ayeka&#39;s to stop her frantic actions. &quot;You&#39;ll have planty of 
opportunities to use it. But, for now, let me work some of my magic on 
you.&quot; Sliding herself onto the free end of the dildo, she pressed 
downward until Ayeka was laying back on the mat and both girls had the 
entire object hidden from view. Ayeka moaned at the feeling of being 
filled so completely while Ryoko&#39;s clitoris pressed against hers. 
Before she could enjoy it too long, however, Ryoko began moving. 
Slowly at first, but, once both she and the princess became used to 
the feeling, she started going faster and harder, causing the moaning 
and screaming in the room to become almost too much to handle.

Before they could reach ecstacy, however, Ayeka pulld away from Ryoko, 
who had a look of incredible shock on her face. Before the pirate 
could say anything, however, Ayeka turned around, got on all fours, 
and pointed to her &#39;back door&#39;. &quot;Do me here, Ryoko.&quot;

The cyan-haired beauty need no more prompting. Placing the end of the 
dildo at Ayeka&#39;s hole she pressed in, amazed at how tight the princess 
was.

Ayeka had never felt anything like this before. She once used a dildo 
in that hole back on Jurai, but she hadn&#39;t gotten much pleasure from 
it, so she assumed that it wasn&#39;t an erogonous zone. Ryoko, however, 
proved her wrong. Ayeka screamed in pleasure as Ryoko pounded her ass 
for all it was worth, while reaching around and playing with Ayeka&#39;s 
breasts and pussy as she humped. They stayed like this for several 
minutes, neither one wanting it to end, until their orgasms hit and 
forced them to stop because of sheer exhaustion.

After replacing the dildo and washing themselves off in the bath, 
Ayeka and Ryoko hugged and kissed for a while, but were too tired to 
do anything else. When they decided it was time to get out, Ayeka 
pointed to her tattered clothes. &quot;I can&#39;t wear those on front of Lord 
Tenchi, and imagine what Lord Nobuyuki would say.&quot;

&quot;Not a problesm.&quot; Ryoko said, grabbing onto Ayeka. The next thing the 
princess knew, she was back in her room.

&quot;Thank you, Ryoko.&quot; Ayeka then walked over to her closet, selected a 
long blue kimono, put it on, and began brushing her hair.

&quot;No undergarments, Princess?&quot;

&quot;They are forbidden on Jurai. Plus, I&#39;ve heard that they can be 
extremely uncomfortable.&quot;

&quot;I heard the same thing. I&#39;d rather have on just one layer of 
clothing.&quot; She then silently moved over to Ayeka and cupped her 
breasts, suprising the violet-haired woman. &quot;Plus, it provides easier 
access to &#39;certain&#39; parts of the body.&quot;

&quot;You know, Ryoko,&quot; Ayeka began, &quot;it would be a shame if we could not 
experience sex with each other again.&quot;

&quot;Are you saying you want to keep me as your lover, Princess?&quot;

&quot;Yes. It&#39;s just too good a feeling to pass up.&quot;

&quot;And what if Tenchi eventually chooses one of us?&quot; Ryoko asked.

&quot;Well, then, I see no reason to stop seeing one another. I mean, Lord 
Tenchi would be glad to see the two of us getting along so well.&quot; 
Then, with an evil gleam in her eye, she added, &quot;And maybe we can 
invite him to join us now and then.&quot;

&quot;I never knew you were such a pervert, Ayeka.&quot; She kissed Ayeka&#39;s neck 
before adding. &quot;And it makes me love you even more.&quot;

&quot;After today, I can believe that I Iove you as well, Ryoko.&quot;

&quot;Do you think Sasami would mind if you and I spent tonight out in the 
forest? I&#39;ll supply the tent.&quot;

&quot;She won&#39;t mind as long as we&#39;re civil to one another. But, if you&#39;re 
supplying the tent,&quot; she reahed into her dresser and pulled out a 
rather large grey case. &quot;I&#39;m supplying the entertainment.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s in that thing, Ayeka?&quot; Ryoko asked.

&quot;Some magazines I managed to get from Nobuyuki, as well as 
certain....&#39;objects&#39; I believe you&#39;ll enjoy.&quot;

Ryoko was almost drooling in anticipation. &quot;Do any of them....I 
mean....well...&quot; she trailed off, trying to search for the word.

Ayeka giggled. &quot;Yes, Ryoko, a good number of them do vibrate.&quot;

Ryoko smiled and said, &quot;I can&#39;t wait for nightfall.&quot;

&quot;Neither can I, my love. Neither can I.&quot; With that, Ayeka turned 
around and kissed Ryoko, both of them confident that, no matter what 
else happened, they would always have each other.

cook my steaks. CYA!
