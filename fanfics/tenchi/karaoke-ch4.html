<h1>Karaoke Night (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/overstreet.html">Clayton Overstreet</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../tenchi/karaoke-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Six weeks. Six weeks since that embarrassing day. Aeka lay on her bed 
staring at the ceiling and for the millionth time the events played 
themselves out. 

At first she remembered that she&#39;d refused to believe it. The entire 
idea was ridiculous and revolting. But the taunting laughter of the 
others had driven all that from her mind... especially Ryoko&#39;s. 

Then had come acceptance. After all Tenchi had chosen and how he and 
the others chose to spend their time alone had been none of her 
business. Aeka would simply play with her sister and talk to them when 
they were around. 

That hadn&#39;t worked out like she&#39;d hoped. Sasami was a great kid... but 
she was a kid. And the others. Whenever she looked at them she 
couldn&#39;t help noticing glances and body language that she knew 
involved &quot;it&quot; and was well aware that she was being left out. 

Finally curiosity and loneliness had gotten the better of her. 
Obviously to the others it was a commonplace subject. It was like 
answering questions children asked. The answers were never in detail 
because everyone assumed that they were obvious. And Aeka didn&#39;t know 
what questions to ask or how to ask. So she&#39;d gone to the only person 
around who had any clue about how to teach. 

Three hours later she&#39;d stumbled out of Washu&#39;s lab with all her 
questions answered and then some, but new ones forming in her mind. 
Why would somebody do that? How could they stand something so... 
messy? Washu had told her there were other ways. 

But her thoughts brought about physical reactions that she hadn&#39;t 
noticed before. Things she&#39;d just put out of her mind, as &quot;one of 
those things&quot; for most of her life, but that she now knew were 
physical reactions to desire and hormones. Slowly she&#39;d felt her mind 
sinking into those reactions and almost unconsciously she&#39;d worked her 
way up to the solitude of her room. Then just as she&#39;d learned in 
Washu&#39;s lab she began to explore herself. 

A short time later, riding the strange feelings coming from inside her 
she realized how much noise she was making... and that it wasn&#39;t just 
her. Ryoko and Tenchi&#39;s voices had joined hers. Shocked at first, her 
emotions twisting inside her, stopping was the one idea that had 
quickly fled her mind. Embarrassing as it was to realize that they 
heard her and to know what they were doing Aeka had been unable to 
control herself. Hours later she&#39;d been too tired to think about it 
and had merely decided to clean herself up and take care of the 
consequences after dinner. 

After all it was only Lord Tenchi and Ryoko. She knew in her heart 
that Tenchi would make Ryoko promise not to tell. And Washu had said 
not to be embarrassed. Everyone in the house, including her little 
sister, knew far more about it than Aeka did and didn&#39;t care. This was 
proven when at dinner instead of fighting, both she and Ryoko had kept 
the conversation civilized and aside from a few smirks and the 
occasional comment that could be taken either way (all of which earned 
her a jab in the ribs from Tenchi that made every one worth while to 
the princess), nothing had come of it. 

When Mihoshi and Kiyone came back and the others went out to greet 
them, she&#39;d attracted Washu&#39;s attention and hung back. 

&quot;Yes Aeka?&quot; 

Aeka took a deep breath and said, &quot;Washu... I know you probably know 
what happened up in my room. You showed me enough of Tenchi and Ryoko. 
More than enough really.&quot; Washu chuckled and Aeka felt herself blush. 
&quot;And I know you said not to be embarrassed... but I can&#39;t seem to help 
it.&quot; 

&quot;And you want me to tell you how you can stop blushing all the time 
whenever it... comes up?&quot; Washu winked and Aeka felt her face heat up 
even more. 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;Well princess my advice is to just keep practicing until you&#39;re used 
to it. Don&#39;t worry Aeka. The feelings you&#39;re having are normal.&quot; 

So that was that, Aeka decided. She&#39;d simply have to find her private 
moments and get it out of her system when she could and them forget 
about it like the others did. After all they all seemed perfectly 
normal and did all sorts of other things. Tenchi still worked in the 
fields; Mihoshi and Kiyone still went on patrol and did their jobs, 
and Sasami (If she did it. Aeka didn&#39;t have the courage to ask) still 
cooked, cleaned, and played with Ryo-ohki. 

That plan was easier said than done. At first she&#39;d found it difficult 
to chose the right time. For two days she&#39;d been unable to decide. The 
urge to once again experience the feeling increased. Part of Washu&#39;s 
lecture had included tampons, but it seemed that Aeka would be spared 
that embarrassment. Juraian females were designed with a &quot;reservoir&quot; 
just on the inside of their labia. Unless they were spread out then it 
simply pooled. This seemed like a good idea at the time... but then 
Aeka had begun to wish she had the excuse to use one. Doing it in the 
shower had just seemed counter productive and Ryoko would just show up 
at the door and start banging until she couldn&#39;t concentrate. 

On the third day it was taking all of her self-control and some very 
loose outfits to hide the shaking in her legs. Everything had reminded 
her of it. Every commercial, every piece of food, and it was best not 
to get her started on how she felt watching her soap operas. Ryoko was 
still complaining about the broken on/off switch on the remote. In the 
end Aeka had simply excused herself and made her way as gracefully as 
possible out the back door. 

For three weeks that was the way of things. Over and over again Aeka 
replayed the first time in her head and continued to enjoy it. 
Sometimes she pictured what Mihoshi and Kiyone might be doing... not 
hard thanks to Washu&#39;s oh so thorough library of films. Then she&#39;d 
tried Tenchi and Ryoko. Somehow that didn&#39;t work though. She couldn&#39;t 
imagine how it might feel for a man and Ryoko wasn&#39;t exactly her idea 
of a perfect mate. 

Time worked against her though. Washu had been right about it becoming 
commonplace. Aeka hadn&#39;t thought that would be a problem. In her mind 
eventually it would be something she hardly thought about. She might 
stroke herself off in the shower in a few minutes and be able to go 
about her day normally. 

Instead it began to get harder and harder to finish herself off. She 
felt like a heroine addict who&#39;d developed immunity. Sneaking into 
Noboyuki&#39;s room she&#39;d managed to find enough material to keep herself 
mentally turned on for another week. But again it quickly fell short. 
The feeling was still there but she couldn&#39;t make it go away. It 
simply kept building and building until she found herself picturing 
sex all the time in ways she hadn&#39;t even considered. Pairing her 
friends off with herself and each other in her mind. Mentally dressing 
them up in things they&#39;d never wear and that Aeka had only seen in the 
magazines. Watching Sasami when she slept and getting urges she KNEW 
she&#39;d kill herself if she ever acted upon. It was excruciating 
torture. 

Six weeks, she thought. Six weeks since the events that had triggered 
this living hell. Aeka wished she&#39;d never heard about any of it. That 
she could go back and erase all the... depravity! 

Suddenly she sat up and laughed. &quot;Of course! Washu!&quot; Washu had a time 
machine! It could change things. And Washu would know how to do it! 

Ten minutes of pounding on the door later she was racing through the 
dark corridors of the lab and straight towards the work area. &quot;Washu! 
Washu I need your help!&quot; 

Washu listened to all of Aeka&#39;s complaints. She did so calmly and with 
what Aeka thought was a sympathetic look on her face. That was why it 
was so surprising to the princess when she said, &quot;No.&quot; 

&quot;What? But I explained! I have to do it!&quot; Aeka screeched. 

Washu shook her head. &quot;Aeka the event with Tenchi was an isolated 
incident that I was certain I could get the science academy to allow. 
As you learned from the Haruna incident they keep very close tabs on 
time travel and dimensional shifts. After what happened when I was 
thrown out the last time, they made me swear not to endanger the 
universe again or they would use me as a lab subject.&quot; 

&quot;Ha! You would never let that happen.&quot; Aeka snapped. 

&quot;True, but at the same time I happen to think time travel should only 
be used in life or death situations. Not because a little girl is 
having problems accepting herself. Do you honestly think stopping 
yourself from finding out about it that last time would keep you from 
experiencing this all over again? Am I supposed to keep sending you 
back in time over and over so that you can feel pure forever? Besides, 
I thought the problem was that you can&#39;t do what you want me to stop 
you from doing.&quot; 

Aeka moaned and sunk to her feet. &quot;But it won&#39;t stop! Oh gods I want 
it. I want to feel it! But I can&#39;t make it happen!&quot; Trembling all over 
she pressed her face into the cold floor. 

She jumped when she felt Washu&#39;s hand squeeze her shoulder. &quot;Aeka 
stand up. I&#39;ll see what I can do to help.&quot; Aeka felt surprisingly 
strong hands help her to her feet. Sobbing softly she stood on shaky 
legs and allowed Washu to coax her forward. &quot;Now take off your clothes 
and lay down on the table. I&#39;m going to run some tests.&quot; 

Aeka did as she was told. Her mind thudding she didn&#39;t even think of 
feeling embarrassed as she peeled off the robe she was wearing. 
Focusing she managed to find the metal slab in front of her and 
slipped onto it. The perspiration on her skin caused her to stick a 
bit. Her entire body was so numb she barely noticed Washu attach the 
electrodes to the sides of her head and hit her with the green 
scanning beam. 

&quot;Aeka. Aeka can you hear me?&quot; Washu&#39;s voice sounded very far away. 

&quot;Yes.&quot; She whispered. 

&quot;I&#39;m going to induce an artificial orgasm. It&#39;s going to pinch at 
first, but it&#39;ll begin to feel good quickly. Do you understand?&quot; 

That penetrated the fog of her brain. Washu would make it stop. Washu, 
who had taught her everything about it in the first place. Washu who 
could give her release. Washu... &quot;Now! Do it now!&quot; Aeka screamed. She 
heard her voice echoing through the lab. 

Washu was right, she thought. It did pinch and it did feel good. Of 
course Washu is always right, the thought popped up. She can do 
anything. 

Washu&#39;s image danced through Aeka&#39;s brain as she felt the intense 
pleasure. Inside her Aeka realized that there was only one person 
responsible for the incredible feelings she was having. As her hips 
buckled and her ass slapped the warmed metal beneath her she screamed 
out Washu&#39;s name again and again. Demanded more. Begged for more. 
Muscles in her legs stretched passed the point of pain as she through 
her legs opened and screeched. In her mind all she could see was 
Washu&#39;s face. And then darkness. 

Aeka woke up and saw Tenchi&#39;s concerned face floating over her. &quot;Aeka? 
Aeka are you okay?&quot; 

&quot;Tenchi, look she&#39;d fine. I told you.&quot; Ryoko&#39;s voice 

&quot;Sister, can you sit up?&quot; Sasami said. 

Aeka did so and looked around. She was on her futon. &quot;How... how did I 
get here?&quot; 

&quot;Washu teleported you out. She said you were helping her with some 
sleep research.&quot; Tenchi said. &quot;When you didn&#39;t wake up Sasami and I 
got worried.&quot; 

&quot;Oh. Thank you but I&#39;m fine.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;Did Washu say anything 
else?&quot; 

&quot;Only that if you want to see what her results were to stop by within 
the next two days.&quot; Tenchi said. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re okay?&quot; 

Aeka forced a smile and said, &quot;As long as I&#39;ve woken up with 
everything I went to sleep with I&#39;m fine.&quot; She yawned. Then she 
quickly asked, &quot;I do have everything I had yesterday right?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, unless you didn&#39;t have three arms.&quot; Ryoko said. 

&quot;Ryoko!&quot; Sasami and Tenchi said as Aeka briefly wiggled her fingers. 

&quot;Look, I&#39;m still a little tired.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;I think I&#39;ll just relax. 
And if I don&#39;t wake up in two days get help.&quot; 

&quot;Okay.&quot; They all said taking her very seriously. 

When they&#39;d left Aeka sighed and relaxed back into the covers. Staring 
at the ceiling she took stock of how she felt. Tired was her first 
thought. It was like every piece of her was barely holding together. 
Surprise came next. She knew that after everything she&#39;d done writhing 
around in the lab she should hurt all over. Regret settled over her 
like a cloud. Washu had probably used something to heal her. She knew 
she should feel relief. She could think again and she was the urges 
she&#39;d been having had faded like a bad dream. In fact her entire body 
was in perfect shape. 

&quot;So why do I feel robbed?&quot; She asked. In her mind somehow she felt 
she&#39;d earned every bruise and every strained muscle. It was only fair 
after all that time. Shaking her head to try to sort through her 
thoughts, she didn&#39;t even know when it was she fell asleep. 

The next day Aeka was sitting at the breakfast table and trying to 
swallow. Tenchi and the others were planning out their day. Somehow it 
all seemed the same though. Tenchi going off to the fields, Sasami 
playing with Ryo-ohki... what was the point really? 

&quot;Aeka?&quot; Sasami asked. 

Aeka looked up. &quot;Huh?&quot; 

&quot;You barely touched your breakfast.&quot; 

&quot;Oh. I&#39;m sorry Sasami. I&#39;m just not very hungry.&quot; 

Sasami smiled and hugged her. &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Then she cleared the table. 

Aeka realized that most of the others were already gone. Mihoshi and 
Kiyone hadn&#39;t been by lately, having been busy with their newest part 
time jobs. Washu hadn&#39;t joined them for breakfast. The only ones left 
were Ryoko and Tenchi and he was on his way out the door. While she 
watched he leaned over and kissed Ryoko, then turned and walked out 
the door. Ryoko teleported, probably going somewhere to soak up the 
sun. 

Aeka thought about that kiss. Somehow the thought of having someone to 
kiss her like that seemed to no longer matter to her. In fact she 
realized she felt nothing towards that kind of contact. Shivering she 
wrapped her arms around her shoulders and stared at her reflection in 
the blank television screen. 

Admit it, you&#39;re turning into a pervert, a voice inside her said. 

But how can it be? Washu said there was nothing wrong as long as 
nobody else gets hurt. So why do I feel so guilty about these 
thoughts? Washu would probably know. Washu knows everything. 

Aeka slapped both hands on her cheeks hard. &quot;Snap out of it!&quot; She was 
blushing uncontrollably. Washu&#39;s face was still dancing through her 
head. Well that and other parts. &quot;But that&#39;s improper... isn&#39;t it?&quot; 

How was she going to solve this? Washu was the one with all the 
answers. But Aeka couldn&#39;t talk to Washu about... well about being 
attracted to Washu. There, she&#39;d said it, more or less. To herself 
anyway. So whom was she going to talk to? Ryo-ohki? Yeah right, and 
have Ryoko appear just in time to make fun of her. Noboyuki would want 
to join in and Aeka found the thought disgusting. Mihoshi and Kiyone 
weren&#39;t around. They at least had experience, but once again Aeka 
wouldn&#39;t be able to count on them keeping quiet about it. Not that she 
was ashamed. As a princess she could do whatever she wanted. She just 
wanted to do it quietly for now. 

There really was only one answer. In the next few minutes she was 
working her way up the steps to the shrine. She knocked on the door 
and waited. 

&quot;You may enter,&quot; Yosho said. 

Sliding open the door Aeka quietly stepped inside and sat down across 
from where Yosho sat cross-legged. &quot;Yosho, I need advice. If you would 
be so kind.&quot; 

&quot;That is why I am here Aeka. I noticed at breakfast today that you 
seemed distracted.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, I am. Lately I&#39;ve been going through some things and I&#39;m having 
a problem handling them.&quot; She took a deep breath. &quot;Only one person has 
been helping me and I,&quot; She stopped and took a deep breath. &quot;I don&#39;t 
know how to express my gratitude in an acceptable way.&quot; 

&quot;Does this involve Tenchi?&quot; Yosho asked. 

Aeka smiled, mostly glad that even Yosho could be wrong. &quot;No. I love 
Tenchi, but this is different. I don&#39;t... you can&#39;t tell anyone what I 
say can you?&quot; 

&quot;I will not.&quot; He said. 

&quot;I don&#39;t lust after him. Not the way I thought I did before.&quot; 

&quot;Ah. And this other person. I take it that you refer to someone in the 
house? That leaves me with four possibilities and I believe the 
appropriate one would have red hair.&quot; Aeka looked at her lap and 
nodded and Yosho continued. &quot;What&#39;s the rest of it?&quot; Aeka told him. 
All of it. &quot;I see. That&#39;s why you wanted an &#39;acceptable&#39; way to 
express your gratitude.&quot; 

Yes, but that&#39;s not all. I know that if I can&#39;t find some way to 
release myself, I&#39;ll have to keep going back to Washu and I&#39;m afraid 
I&#39;ll do something to embarrass myself in front of her. I couldn&#39;t 
stand that.&quot; 

&quot;Aeka, I am a priest. I have had only two great loves in my life and 
while each other them enjoyed certain things... I don&#39;t know anything 
about this. I feel that perhaps you are talking with the wrong person 
about this. Has it helped any to actually say these things out loud?&quot; 

Aeka took a hissing breath through her teeth. &quot;I suppose. Thank you 
Yosho.&quot; 

&quot;Any time Aeka.&quot; He leaned forward and helped her to her feet. 

Washu heard a hesitant knock at the door and pressed a button on her 
computer. A door appeared behind her and opened, allowing Aeka to walk 
directly too her. &quot;Here for your test results?&quot; 

&quot;Yes. And to thank you Washu. For helping me the other day and for 
whenever you might have to in the future.&quot; 

&quot;It is interesting.&quot; Washu said, pressing a button on her computer. &quot;I 
checked your readings and brain wave patters. You know it took a lot 
to bring you over. More than I expected. Also you seemed to get off at 
the most bizarre moment.&quot; 

Aeka looked at the screen over her shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t 
understand. What is so odd about it?&quot; 

&quot;It wasn&#39;t the pleasure part you enjoyed the most.&quot; 

&quot;Oh.&quot; Aeka said quietly. 

Washu grinned, &quot;I&#39;d like to ask you a few questions Aeka. You may find 
them embarrassing but I need you to answer truthfully and in detail. 
It&#39;s to help find a solution to your problem.&quot; 

&quot;Okay.&quot; Aeka said. 

Moments later she was once again laying on the table, Washu&#39;s 
electrodes attached to her head. 

&quot;I know a lot already.&quot; Washu said. &quot;This is all very new to you, but 
you&#39;re catching on remarkably quickly and with a lot of enthusiasm.&quot; 
Aeka smiled weakly when Washu giggled. &quot;Now what have you been 
fantasizing about when you masturbate?&quot; 

&quot;Everything.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;Anything I could think of lately. Before I 
had my problem it was just the things you&#39;ve told me and showed me and 
what I found in Noboyuki&#39;s room.&quot; 

&quot;Nobody has touched you though have they?&quot; Washu asked. 

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that most of the candidates for that have been taken.&quot; 
Aeka said. 

&quot;Most?&quot; Washu said, catching an easy slip. &quot;That indicates that there 
are other people in the house that you harbor attractions for.&quot; 

Aeka hesitated before saying, &quot;Yes.&quot; After all if Yosho figured it out 
Washu was probably three jumps ahead. &quot;I&#39;m sure you know.&quot; 

&quot;I could hazard a guess. But a good scientist, even the best, always 
leaves room for interpretation.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s you Washu.&quot; Aeka said flatly. 

&quot;Yeah, I know. But can you think why? After all this does strike me as 
kind of sudden.&quot; 

Aeka was just going to say she didn&#39;t know, but Washu had asked her to 
be honest. &quot;There are many things I guess. You&#39;re beautiful. All of us 
are. You&#39;re strong, energetic, and in control at all times. You&#39;re 
also helpful and when you aren&#39;t cackling your laugh is kind of soft 
and comforting.&quot; She paused. &quot;Though I can&#39;t really fault you there. 
When I get excited my laughter isn&#39;t always the calmest sound.&quot; 

&quot;Is that all?&quot; Washu asked. Aeka noticed her voice seemed deeper 
somehow. 

&quot;No. I guess what really decided it was how helpful you&#39;ve been 
through this whole thing. You understand what I&#39;ve been going through 
and you haven&#39;t been taunting me about it. I understand now how naive 
I&#39;ve been, and you&#39;ve been doing your best to guide me through it.&quot; 

Washu nodded and walked towards the table. &quot;Aeka do you trust me to 
help you more? To help you find out who you are?&quot; 

&quot;With my life.&quot; She said without hesitation. &quot;Though if this involves 
putting my head in a jar I&#39;d like to rephrase that.&quot; 

Washu chuckled and leaned over her. &quot;Not exactly. But I need you to 
trust me. I&#39;ve done a complete profiling on you Aeka. I&#39;ve added in 
the new data and everything you&#39;ve told me about your experiences. 
Then I added everything about your upbringing and anything else I 
could think of.&quot; 

&quot;And what did you discover.&quot; 

&quot;When you think about the pleasure part of sex, what comes to mind 
Aeka?&quot; 

Aeka stared up at Washu&#39;s green eyes. &quot;The first time I did it, when I 
was in my room and doing it for the first time.&quot; 

&quot;And what was different about that time?&quot; Washu moved closer. &quot;Tell me 
what parts you liked.&quot; 

&quot;I honestly don&#39;t know. I suppose because it was new. It hurt a lot 
but after a while I didn&#39;t notice. The pain just became part of the 
pleasure. Even the embarrassment I felt when I heard Ryoko and Tenchi 
through the wall and realized they could hear me.&quot; Her words were 
coming faster now, more easily as Washu circled the table. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
need to think. I didn&#39;t know what to expect or what might happen next. 
I was afraid and embarrassed and hurt and I liked all of it. When it 
ended the last part was great too.&quot; 

&quot;But by itself it isn&#39;t enough is it? Just to want to finish doesn&#39;t 
quiet do it for you does it princess?&quot; 

Aeka looked up at her in shock. &quot;Washu!&quot; She froze when the scientist 
reached down and cupped her cheek in a hand that was just as smooth as 
Aeka had imagined. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m going to give you what you want Aeka. What you need. But that 
might not be what you think it is. That&#39;s why I need you to trust me 
to do what&#39;s right for you and that I know what that is.&quot; 

&quot;Washu? I...&quot; Aeka looked into Washu&#39;s eyes and nodded. &quot;I trust you.&quot; 

&quot;Good.&quot; Washu ran the back of her hand along Aeka&#39;s cheek. &quot;The psyche 
profile said that you have what I would deem control issues.&quot; 

&quot;But I&#39;m a princess. I&#39;m going to rule the empire. I have to be in 
control.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;Unwavering and unquestioned.&quot; 

&quot;Yes. But that&#39;s not what you want is it?&quot; Washu smiled and leaned 
over her. Aeka was aware of the scientist&#39;s breasts pressing into her 
through the shirt Washu was wearing. It was pink with a brown skirt. 
It&#39;s amazing what you notice when your heart is about to leap through 
your chest. &quot;You want someone else to take control and make you do all 
the things you don&#39;t have the courage to do on your own. Someone 
powerful enough to do it.&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; Aeka said, still staring at Washu&#39;s chest. &quot;But this feels so 
wrong.&quot; 

&quot;Doesn&#39;t it though?&quot; Washu said with a grin. &quot;Now do you want to know 
what I want you to do Aeka? Do you want me to tell you?&quot; Aeka nodded. 
&quot;Good. But if I go too far I want you to tell me. Can I trust you with 
that?&quot; Aeka nodded and jumped when the table she was on began to tip 
forward. 

&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m going to give you what you really want Aeka. And I&#39;m going to 
take what I want from you. Do you understand?&quot; 

&quot;Take?&quot; Aeka felt a bit of fear in her stomach. 

&quot;Oh yes.&quot; Washu&#39;s voice came from somewhere behind her. &quot;I want to 
take it from you. I need you to struggle and try to keep what I&#39;m 
going after.&quot; 

&quot;But then how will you know if you&#39;ve gone too far?&quot; Aeka shivered at 
the thought. &quot;What if I really want to stop?&quot; 

&quot;Then you&#39;ll have to say something. Something you don&#39;t normally say 
when you&#39;re scared. That way I&#39;ll know if you&#39;re serious.&quot; Washu 
stepped around the table. &quot;Unless you don&#39;t want to.&quot; 

Aeka was speechless. Washu was standing in front of her in what 
appeared to be an outfit made of green latex rubber. Well not so much 
an outfit as an outline. There were two thigh high boots and gloves 
that went up to her elbows. Just under her breasts was what would have 
been a bra except it only lifted, not covering anything. The rest of 
her body was completely bare and as Aeka&#39;s gaze moved over it, parts 
of Washu were getting wetter by the minute. Aeka also realized that 
she was in the same predicament. 

Her first instinct was to turn and run. Everything in her body 
screamed for her to do just that as she realized what Washu was 
planning. The magazines had called it S&amp;M and bondage. Those had been 
something she&#39;d only skimmed in the magazines. There was no doubt in 
her mind who would be in charge if she allowed this to continue. The 
humiliation Aeka would suffer is she submitted to this. Washu had 
already hinted that it would hurt too. Pain, servitude, and 
humiliation loomed in Aeka&#39;s future. 

&quot;Ramen.&quot; Aeka said. 

&quot;What?&quot; Washu looked genuinely confused. 

Aeka kept staring at Washu&#39;s body and said, &quot;If I say ramen, you know 
like the noodles, you stop. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s because I&#39;m too 
afraid or whatever.&quot; 

Washu smiled and without warning darted forward to roughly kiss Aeka 
on the lips, forcing her tongue passed the startled princess&#39;s lips. 
Aeka&#39;s eyes widened and then she began to reciprocate, her own tongue 
flicking at the invader of its turf. As her arms rose to wrap around 
Washu she was shocked when the red head slapped them away. 

&quot;What...&quot; She was stopped by another slap, this time across her face. 

&quot;You do not move unless I tell you. You do not speak unless I ask you 
a question. If you do you will be punished.&quot; Washu was pleased to note 
Aeka&#39;s nipples harden quickly and felt her own tighten in response. 
&quot;Very good.&quot; Washu reached out and took Aeka&#39;s chin between her 
fingers. &quot;Now my little pet, we&#39;re going to establish some rules. 
First off you will call me Little Washu whenever you answer a 
question. Do you understand?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; Aeka could barely breathe. She was shaking. She shook more as 
Washu slapped the other cheek. 

&quot;What was that?&quot; Washu&#39;s voice was cold and stern. 

&quot;Yes, Little Washu.&quot; Aeka amended. 

&quot;Much better.&quot; Washu said. She leaned in and slowly licked across 
Aeka&#39;s cheek. &quot;Obedience will be rewarded. But first tell me 
something. What do you feel like right now? Knowing that it&#39;s within 
your power to stop me and that you don&#39;t want to? What would you call 
someone like that?&quot; Aeka hesitated. Washu&#39;s hand shot out and roughly 
grabbed her nipple between three fingers, twisting it hard enough to 
make Aeka cry out. &quot;Well princess? What would you call someone who 
would debase herself like this just for sexual release.&quot; She leaned 
forward, twisting in the other direction and whispered in Aeka&#39;s ear. 
&quot;Come on. You&#39;ve called Ryoko one enough.&quot; Aeka quietly answered the 
question and Washu released her chest. &quot;What was that?&quot; 

&quot;A slut.&quot; Aeka said. Washu slapped her on the nipple she had just 
released. &quot;Little Washu.&quot; 

&quot;Very good. Now say it again, only louder. What are you?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m a slut Little Washu.&quot; 

Washu cackled as loud as Aeka had ever heard. It sent a shiver through 
her whole body. Then Washu&#39;s hand shot out again, wrapping around 
Aeka&#39;s throat and squeezing almost but not quite hard enough to cut 
off her air. She was roughly pushed back against the metal table and 
could only watch as Washu leaned forward to suck at the base of her 
neck. Aeka&#39;s legs wobbled slightly and she had to grab the table for 
support and moaned. Washu grabbed her wrist and pulled it away. &quot;You 
moved.&quot; Aeka didn&#39;t respond. &quot;What do you think I should do with you?&quot; 

&quot;Could you...&quot; She was slapped much harder this time. 

&quot;Rule two is I decide what happens to you. Now answer again. What 
should I do with you?&quot; 

Her cheek throbbing Aeka said, &quot;Whatever you want Little Washu.&quot; 

&quot;And what will you do?&quot; 

&quot;Whatever you say Little Washu.&quot; Aeka answered dutifully. She was 
beginning to enjoy this. The fear and lust were mixing sending her 
inhibitions on a vacation. It felt good and she wanted more. 

&quot;Very good. I think I&#39;ll like my new toy.&quot; She grinned and squeezed 
Aeka&#39;s throat again. Pulling she forced the princess&#39;s head to her and 
took another kiss. Aeka knew what would happen if she struggled... so 
she did. Pushing at Washu&#39;s chest she managed to get the scientist off 
of her, the latex gloves tugging at her neck as she slipped free. 

Washu was surprised at first; mostly that Aeka would defy her so soon. 
Had the princess decided she didn&#39;t want to do this after all? Had 
Washu gone too far too quick? 

But Aeka didn&#39;t say the word. She didn&#39;t run. Instead she stood with 
her back to the table staring at Washu with a mix of fear and list as 
bruises formed on her neck and under her left eye. 

&quot;So... not as quick a learner as I thought.&quot; Washu said, knowing that 
Aeka was just the opposite. When this was over Washu would have to 
find out exactly what kind of magazines Noboyuki had in his room. 
&quot;Disobedience must be punished.&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; Aeka said defiantly. Her skin was breaking out into a cold 
sweat. 

Washu&#39;s eyes flashed and she grabbed Aeka&#39;s arm, forcing her down. 
Then she twisted it behind the princess&#39;s back and stuck a knee into 
the back of her leg. Aeka was pushed onto her knees, her arm pressed 
into her back. Washu pressed forward, pushing Aeka&#39;s face into the 
cold floor. With her free hand she reached down and between Aeka&#39;s 
legs, forcing her middle finger of her left hand into Aeka&#39;s pussy and 
rubbing in hard. 

&quot;First you don&#39;t do as you&#39;re told and then you tell me &quot;no&quot;? Such a 
naughty pet you are. What do you think should be done with a pet that 
doesn&#39;t do as it&#39;s told?&quot; 

It, Aeka realized. She is using me as a thing. She&#39;s going to use me 
for her own enjoyment and then either abuse my body for her own 
enjoyment or simply toss me aside. She gasped as her arm was twisted 
up harder. 

&quot;You didn&#39;t answer me.&quot; Washu hissed. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know Little Washu.&quot; Aeka managed. Tears were pouring down her 
cheeks. 

&quot;I think you need to be punished.&quot; Washu let her arm go and relieved 
the pressure holding her to the floor. &quot;Don&#39;t you?&quot; 

&quot;Yes Little Washu.&quot; Aeka said, not moving her arm or her face. She did 
however squirm as Washu began moving her finger in and out of Aeka&#39;s 
pussy. She felt her own juices begin to drip down her legs. But just 
before she would have finished Washu removed her hand. 

Walking around in front Washu used her clean hand and lifted Aeka&#39;s 
face up so she could see. Washu slipped the tip of the finger she&#39;d 
been using into her mouth and made a show of sucking on it, flicking 
her tongue over the surface and moaning loudly, then licking her lips. 
Then she squatted down and pushed it to Aeka&#39;s mouth. &quot;Suck it.&quot; 

Aeka opened her mouth. Washu&#39;s hand stayed where it was. Realizing 
that she was expected to do the work Aeka moved her head forward and 
wrapped her lips around the finger. The taste was bitter and she 
wasn&#39;t entirely sure she liked it, but she sucked at the finger and 
then pulled back. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t tell you to stop.&quot; Washu said. &quot;And I&#39;m sure you can do much 
better than that. Don&#39;t be afraid to use your teeth.&quot; 

With her arm still behind her back Aeka moved her head forward again, 
sucking at Washu&#39;s finger. Even as she felt the last bit of her cum 
drip down her throat. She lost herself in the moment and began to 
experiment. Working her tongue over the length of the finger she 
moaned like Washu had when she&#39;d been tasting it and dragged her teeth 
against the rubber. She felt the finger move and looked up to see 
Washu using her free hand to stroke at her own pussy. Her legs were 
spread inches from Aeka&#39;s face so she could see and hear every move 
Washu&#39;s fingers made. She had her eyes closed. Aeka could have easily 
gotten up and run to the door. Instead she pulled back along all but 
the tip of the finger and used her teeth to bite down hard. 

&quot;Ouch!&quot; Washu&#39;s eyes snapped open and she grinned down at Aeka. &quot;So 
you want to play rough do you?&quot; 

It was a rhetorical question, but Aeka answered anyway. &quot;Yes, Little 
Washu.&quot; 

&quot;Oh baby.&quot; Washu shuddered, still rubbing at herself with her other 
hand. Aeka&#39;s eyes were drawn to her there, unable to look away. &quot;So do 
you like what you see?&quot; 

&quot;Yes Little Washu.&quot; Aeka said. 

&quot;Touch it.&quot; Washu said. She pulled her fingers out and spread her 
pussy open so that Aeka could see the red and pink flesh inside. &quot;You 
want to touch it don&#39;t you?&quot; 

&quot;Yes Little Washu.&quot; Aeka finally moved her arm from behind her back, 
using her left to push herself up so that her eyes were level with 
Washu&#39;s crotch. 

&quot;Hurry.&quot; Washu cooed. &quot;Hurry or I won&#39;t let you.&quot; 

Aeka&#39;s hand moved out and she pushed her index finger directly into 
the hole. At least that&#39;s what she intended to do. Washu jumped back 
at the last minute and stepped on Aeka&#39;s reaching hand, pushing it to 
the floor and digging in her heel. 

&quot;Then again, maybe you shouldn&#39;t. Little girls who can&#39;t do as they&#39;re 
told don&#39;t get to play any of the fun games.&quot; 

Aeka clenched her teeth. Her hand hurt and she was still on her knees. 
Above her Washu was grinning down showing all of her teeth. 

&quot;But then since you are so naughty maybe you have some ideas your 
owner might like.&quot; She moved her boot and stood back, her legs apart 
just above Aeka&#39;s head. &quot;Do you have anything you want to do or have 
done?&quot; 

&quot;Whatever you want Little Washu.&quot; Aeka said. She was beyond the need 
for pain now. She wanted pleasure while she enjoyed the throb of her 
bruises. 

Washu had other plans. &quot;Good pet. Stay there on your hands and knees. 
I&#39;ll be right back with some toys. You will stare at the floor until I 
say otherwise.&quot; 

Aeka did as she was told. For untold minutes, each lasting an 
eternity, she looked at the white floor. It didn&#39;t really matter 
anyway. She was in the only lit area in the lab. All around her was 
nothing but darkness. 

After who knows how long she finally heard the clack of Washu&#39;s heels 
on the floor. They moved up behind her and she gasped, feeling the 
scientist lay across her back. The rubber clad legs wrapped around her 
waist and Aeka felt Washu begin to grind her wet crotch into her back. 
Above her Washu screamed out as her hips bucked against Aeka&#39;s flesh, 
soaking her back and pushing the clit into Aeka harder and harder. 

Aeka felt her legs clench and let out her own cry as her pussy 
twitched. Washu&#39;s hand slapped over Aeka&#39;s pussy hard as the princess 
came and shoved three fingers in without waiting for the princess to 
get ready. Aeka screamed and her arms buckled, crashing her to the 
floor, her ass up in the air. Washu was still riding her, pistoning 
her fingers into the virgin princess and began rubbing her thumb over 
and inside Aeka&#39;s asshole. The princess was torn between how good it 
felt and how disgusting it was to have Washu put something into that 
particular orifice. Washu&#39;s cum dripped down her spine and pooled 
between her shoulder blades. Aeka came again and collapsed bonelessly 
to the floor. 

Washu finally got off of her and spoke down. &quot;You enjoyed that pet?&quot; 

&quot;Yes Little Washu.&quot; Aeka mumbled. 

&quot;Do you want a surprise now? A very special treat that you haven&#39;t had 
yet?&quot; 

Aeka was tired. She&#39;d never come this much before without passing out. 
But she wanted to please Washu. Inside it was all she cared about. 
With her eyes still on the floor she said, &quot;Oh yes, Little Washu. 
Please.&quot; 

&quot;You can look up now.&quot; 

Aeka pushed her hands under her and slowly raised her head. She was 
surprised to see Washu standing there holding something in her hand. 
It was at least a foot long and in the middle it bent like a V. It was 
orange, obviously made of rubber, and had teeth marks in it. 

&quot;Do you know what this is?&quot; Aeka answered that she did. &quot;Sit back 
against the table and spread your legs.&quot; Aeka did as she was told and 
waited. Washu slowly peeled off her gloved and tossed them over her 
shoulder. &quot;Reach between my legs and scrape up all the cum. Use your 
nails and get every drop into your hands.&quot; 

Aeka reached out, pressing her fingers into the soft and pliant flesh 
of Washu&#39;s thighs. They were wet, drenched really, and Aeka could 
smell the musk wafting and mixing with her own scent. She dragged her 
fingers over the skin, pooling some of what she still felt dripping 
down her back into her hands until Washu&#39;s legs and pussy were dry 
again and her hands were soaked. Washu extended the dildo to her and 
Aeka understood. She rubbed it between her hands, spreading it over 
the six inches pointed at her. 

&quot;Spread your legs more.&quot; Washu said. &quot;Then sit back and watch.&quot; She 
sat down on her knees and leaned forward between Aeka&#39;s legs. Reaching 
forward with her free hand she scooped up the cum still flowing 
through the curly light blue hair. &quot;Not your natural color.&quot; Washu 
observed. Aeka began to speak and was rewarded with a nail digging 
into her thigh hard. &quot;Shhh!&quot; Aeka saw a drop of blood slowly form on 
the fresh scratch and groaned in erotic shame as Washu bent to lick it 
off, rubbing the juices she&#39;d collected from Aeka over the wet end of 
the toy mixing it with her own. 

Aeka felt Washu blow cool air directly into her pussy and felt the 
lips part. That was when Washu brought the orange thing forward and 
pressed the wet tip into Aeka. &quot;You have a choice here. Now do you 
know what I&#39;m going to do to you? I want to hear you say it.&quot; 

Aeka struggled with the word. Washu began to pull the dildo away and 
she blurted out, &quot;You&#39;re going to fuck me little Washu!&quot; Her face was 
bright red and she knew it, blood flowing through it and lower areas. 
Her nipples hardened again. She wondered how she was able to use that 
word like that. Trying to look away from Washu&#39;s eyes she found a firm 
hand holding her chin in place, while green eyes stared into hers. 

&quot;But since it&#39;s your first time I&#39;m giving you a choice. I can fuck 
slow and hard or fast and easy. Do you want me to play around or just 
do it?&quot; 

&quot;Both little Washu.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;You decide. I can&#39;t. You&#39;re in 
charge. I&#39;ll do whatever you want!&quot; 

Washu grinned up at her and released her chin. While Aeka stared Washu 
slowly forced the dildo into Aeka inch by inch and ran her free hand 
over the princess&#39;s chest, tugging at her breasts with an entire palm. 
Aeka moved her legs softly, trying to let the slick piece of rubber 
slide in faster. Gods, she thought, it must be two inches thick. There 
were small sharp spots where the tooth marks were. 

Washu stopped when the entire thing was buried and rubbed her cheek 
against Aeka&#39;s thigh. Looking up she caught Aeka&#39;s eyes and while Aeka 
stared she wrapped her lips around the other end of the dildo sliding 
it in and out of her mouth. Aeka felt every bob of Washu&#39;s head as her 
end responded. Washu let it go and began using her teeth as Aeka had 
on her finger, working along the side with her tongue like a Popsicle 
or a cob of corn. 

Aeka squealed when Washu took it in her fist like a lever and jerked 
down, forcing the tip to rub harshly on the inside of Aeka&#39;s pussy. A 
cruel grin on her face Washu sat up and without ceremony slammed her 
pussy onto her end of it. 

Aeka&#39;s eyes rolled in her head and she breathed out, &quot;Little Washu...&quot; 
Washu&#39;s legs straddled Aeka and she dug her nails into the princess&#39;s 
shoulders. Leaning forward she once again kissed Aeka&#39;s eager lips and 
then slowly worked her way down her neck and to the two small pink 
nipples. &quot;Ah!&quot; Washu didn&#39;t even bother to suck. She bit down roughly 
and tugged hard. 

&quot;Now pet you were half right.&quot; She bounced up and down on Aeka&#39;s lap. 
&quot;You&#39;re going to fuck me. You&#39;re going to do it now and how I say.&quot; 
Aeka couldn&#39;t even respond. She simply nodded her head reverently and 
waited for instructions. It didn&#39;t take long. 

Washu&#39;s nails dug into Aeka&#39;s shoulders and pulled, toppling her back 
and Aeka forward, burying her face in Washu&#39;s breasts. &quot;Do it.&quot; 

Aeka&#39;s hips rolled in circles, her pussy clutching at the dildo as she 
forced it in and out of Washu. In between their clits rubbed against 
each other. An idea slipped into her head and she went with it. &quot;This 
is wrong Washu. It&#39;s wrong and dirty and I can&#39;t keep doing it. Let me 
go!&quot; She pulled back, slipping all but the tip out of Washu. 

She was dragged back by what felt like claws digging into her ass. 
Washu pulled her back hard and bit down like an animal on Aeka&#39;s 
shoulder. Pain shot through her skin and she felt blood drip from 
around Washu&#39;s lips. 

&quot;Selfish little bitch! You&#39;ll do as you&#39;re told and fuck me! And don&#39;t 
just fuck me. Suck my tits.&quot; Washu tugged on Aeka&#39;s hair, forcing her 
mouth to the bright red nipples in front of her. Washu came hard as 
Aeka sucked it in, and simply rode her harder. Washu&#39;s own hands were 
working over Aeka&#39;s body, roughly pressing into her breasts and butt 
cheeks, and leaving deep scratches. Aeka reciprocated, digging her own 
nails into Washu&#39;s back. &quot;Yes! Oh yes! Shove that dick of yours in 
there harder Aeka. Deeper!&quot; 

Enjoying things too much to be embarrassed Aeka did as she was told 
and received her own pleasure as Washu&#39;s hips buckled and their pussy 
lips met. 

Nearly a half hour later Washu had collapsed on top of Aeka and had 
meticulously removed their connecting device. Together they sucked it 
clean between kisses and Washu held Aeka to her. 

&quot;I could fix those scratches.&quot; She whispered. &quot;So that nobody would 
know.&quot; 

&quot;No.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;I like them. I&#39;ll just tell them I tripped over some 
of your equipment.&quot; 

Washu chuckled and ran her fingers through Aeka&#39;s hair. &quot;You&#39;ll have 
to be punished for that you little cunt.&quot; 

&quot;Yes Little Washu.&quot; Aeka said with a satisfied grin. &quot;I&#39;ll need to be 
punished so very much. I&#39;m going to be very disobedient some times.&quot; 

&quot;Aeka you know I would never do anything to you I wouldn&#39;t let be done 
to me right?&quot; Aeka nodded, burying her face in Washu&#39;s neck. &quot;I went 
easy on you this time. Next time I won&#39;t hold back.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; Aeka said. &quot;I want it all. I&#39;m a slut remember?&quot; 

&quot;My slut.&quot; Washu&#39;s hand traced over her butt. &quot;I remember. And it 
won&#39;t stop here. I&#39;m going to keep coming up with things to do with 
and to you. I&#39;m going to force you to do things that&#39;ll make you 
squirm and maybe I&#39;ll even let Mecha Washu help out. I&#39;m going to fuck 
your brains out and make you my slave.&quot; 

Aeka smiled and pinned Washu down. &quot;And if you ever run out of ideas, 
even if it&#39;s years from now, then it&#39;ll be my turn.&quot; 

&quot;Deal.&quot; They sealed it with another kiss. 

Author&#39;s note 

Another chapter bites the dust. If you think this was a sick, 
degrading, and overly sexual chapter... you&#39;re right. Still I finally 
wrote an Aeka fic. If you wish to comment email me.</pre>
