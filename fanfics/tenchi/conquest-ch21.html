<h1>Conquest (part 21 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tenchi/index.html">Tenchi Muyo</a>

<a href="../tenchi/conquest-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>        Rhione helped escort Mitsuki to a chair, sitting her down at 
one of the tables where many of the partiers then tried to force food 
and drink upon her. The now mostly scruffy looking redhead&#39;s eyes 
widened as the piles of treats and beverages swiftly built up, an odd 
little smile on her face.

        &quot;Nice to know I was missed,&quot; Mitsuki managed.

        Rhione sat down beside her, taking a moment to adjust her 
formal gown. The elegant young woman pushed her long locks of red hair 
back, &quot;You gave us all quite a scare, you know. Queen Serenity, Ryouko 
and Minagi were all frantic.&quot;

        Mitsuki looked up to meet her eyes a moment, almost as if she 
was searching them for her sincerity. More softly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry for 
scaring you that way, but I didn&#39;t have much choice.&quot;

        &quot;I know, I saw most of it,&quot; Rhione murmured quietly. She 
closed her eyes a second, thinking of the Earth cruiser falling 
towards the Palace, the little black fighter swiftly moving in front 
of it, the weapons blazing and then finally ramming into the larger 
ship, exploding in a blaze of fire. &quot;How did you manage to survive 
that?&quot; she asked.

        Mitsuki smiled grimly at her own memories. &quot;I ejected out of 
the fighter just before the ship&#39;s core blew,&quot; she quickly related, 
&quot;but I got caught up in the fireball and shrapnel on the way down.&quot; 
Mitsuki picked one of several alcoholic beverages and drank some down, 
&quot;If I hadn&#39;t been found by the Lady Hotaru, I&#39;d probably have died.&quot;

        &quot;What you did was phenomenally stupid,&quot; Commander Ruri 
appeared by her side to calmly note, the blue haired woman meeting 
Mitsuki&#39;s eyes firmly. &quot;Please don&#39;t do it again, or we might just 
have to give you a medal, next time&quot;

        The two watched her go thoughtfully. &quot;Was that a compliment, 
you think?&quot; Rhione finally asked quizzically.

        &quot;I&#39;m not quite sure,&quot; Mitsuki took another drink.

        Rhione reached out to tug at a tattered bit of Mitsuki&#39;s 
sleeve, &quot;You look like something Ryo-Ohki would refuse to drag in. Why 
don&#39;t we get you changed?&quot;

        &quot;Into what, exactly?&quot; Mitsuki blinked.

        Rhione smiled, her eyes twinkling, &quot;I&#39;m sure we can borrow 
something.&quot;

        Mitsuki suddenly had a bad feeling about that.

        Across the large ballroom, Ryouko and Ayeka watched the two 
get up, Rhione gently tugging a reluctant Mitsuki over to Lady Haruka. 
The three spoke together for a few moments then they moved off, 
leaving the hall together.

        &quot;I wonder what that&#39;s all about?&quot; Ayeka mused.

        &quot;It&#39;s a little quick for them to be planning a threesome,&quot; 
Ryouko answered with a impish little smile. At Ayeka&#39;s frown she 
quickly said, &quot;You haven&#39;t seen how Rhione&#39;s been looking at Mitsuki 
when she thought she wasn&#39;t looking.&quot;

        Ayeka looked where the three woman had disappeared into the 
inner reaches of the Palace, &quot;You may have a point, at that.&quot; Not 
meeting Ryouko&#39;s eyes she smiled just slightly and said, &quot;You&#39;ve got a 
plan, don&#39;t you?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve always got a plan,&quot; was Ryouko&#39;s rather flippant answer. 
She moved a bit so that she was meeting Ayeka&#39;s eyes, &quot;But a plan 
about what?&quot;

        Ayeka smiled slightly, &quot;Earth.&quot;

        Ryouko&#39;s face became serious as she said, &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; A slash 
of white as she smiled, &quot;But I intend to brief everyone in the 
morning.&quot;

        &quot;Hitting them when they&#39;re still groggy and willing to agree 
with almost anything?&quot; Ayeka raised an eyebrow. A smirk, &quot;Good 
negotiating tactics.&quot;

        &quot;Well, I learned from the very best,&quot; Ryouko shrugged. At 
Ayeka&#39;s curious glance she added cheerfully &quot;At the feet of my mom, 
Washu.&quot; She hesitated a moment, &quot;I notice you aren&#39;t pressing me about 
what the plan is.&quot;

        Ayeka smiled up at her grimly, &quot;I&#39;ve got a few guesses.&quot; She 
reached up with a delicate hand, gently cupping Ryouko&#39;s face as she 
said, &quot;And I trust you, m&#39;love. Whatever plan you&#39;ve come up with, you 
know I&#39;ll back you.&quot;

        Ryouko bent down, kissing Ayeka lingeringly. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she 
murmured softly.

        There was a soft disturbance from the other side of the large 
room, and they reluctantly pulled apart. Ayeka took a look and began 
to chuckle softly, then Ryouko turned to take a look and grinned while 
shaking her head.

        Mitsuki had a clearly disgusted expression, dressed up in a 
stylized roman toga, one that was obviously borrowed from Lady Haruka. 
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you talked me into this,&quot; she softly grumbled, 
tugging at the short skirt uncomfortably.

        Rhione beamed, &quot;But you look so good in it.&quot;

        &quot;Oh goddess,&quot; Mitsuki muttered softly.

        An waltz began, the musicians playing the notes smoothly. 
Rhione took Mitsuki&#39;s hands in her own. &quot;Would you dance with me?&quot; the 
noblewoman asked.

        Mitsuki blinked, clearly surprised by the request. But she 
looked down to meet those eyes filled with silent entreaty and smiled 
back to softly say, &quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot; They moved out onto the dance floor 
together, and she felt a bit comforted seeing Queen Serenity and Lady 
Rei along with Ryouko and Ayeka joining in the dance as well.

        The celebration ran on into the night, and the guests from the 
crews of the Swordbreaker and Ryo-Ohki chose to stay in the palace to 
sleep. There was a certain amount of sharing of rooms, the palace 
spacious but not that spacious.

        &quot;You better not snore,&quot; Minagi said to Ruri as she was 
carrying a bedroll into the bedroom they were going to have to share.

        &quot;Like a buzzsaw,&quot; was Ruri&#39;s deadpan answer as she laid out 
her own bedroll, her boy&#39;s pajamas in a somber blue.

        &quot;What?&quot; Minagi blurted, only to see the teasing smile on her 
friend&#39;s face. &quot;Oh, you are going to pay for that, especially after I 
tell Asuka and Rei.&quot;

        In a nearby room, Ryouko gently cradled Ayeka in her arms. 
&quot;See you in the morning, love,&quot; she murmured to her softly.

        Ayeka smiled slightly, her eyes opening as she snuggled into 
Ryouko&#39;s arms. &quot;You&#39;re not that tired, are you?&quot; she asked softly.

        &quot;That depends,&quot; Ryouko drawled, &quot;how quiet can you be?&quot;

        A bit of a flush appeared on Ayeka&#39;s cheeks. &quot;I could always 
bite a pillow,&quot; she smiled shyly.

        Ryouko&#39;s wicked chuckle was her only reply.

        Mitsuki opened the bedroom door, blinking slightly as Rhione 
smiled slightly. &quot;And how did you manage to arrange this?&#39; she asked, 
not that surprised.

        &quot;A few threats,&quot; was Rhione&#39;s cheerful answer as the nightie 
clad woman gently took Mitsuki&#39;s arm and pulled her inside the room.

        &quot;Why..&quot; Mitsuki started, when Rhione gently pressed her lips 
to hers.

        &quot;I was trying to be subtle,&quot; Rhione &#39;s breath teased at 
Mitsuki&#39;s lips as she spoke, &quot;but then I thought I lost you.&quot; A slight 
smile, &quot;Life can be too damn short for games.&quot;

        &quot;Oof,&quot; Mitsuki gasped as she was pushed over, falling onto her 
back on the bed. With an impish little grin on her face Rhione slid on 
top of her. &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Mitsuki kissed her gently.

        For many, it was a too short time before the sun appeared 
above the Moon Kingdom, the chimes jarring many from a sound sleep. 
Food was served, along with hangover remedies, and after a trip down 
the ornate halls, they gathered for Ryouko&#39;s briefing.

        &quot;... and that&#39;s it,&quot; Ryouko finished.

        Lady Rei looked over at her in shock. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious!&quot;

        &quot;Oh, yes she can,&quot; Kiyone growled, &quot;this is just the sort of 
plan Ryouko loves to pull.&quot; She gave her ruler a glare, &quot;I absolutely 
forbid it!&quot;

        Ryouko grinned, &quot;Sorry, but it&#39;s not your call to make.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not too thrilled with this idea either,&quot; Washu said 
dryly, &quot;why are just you and Ayeka attacking this Tenchi&#39;s 
headquarters?&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s no offense intended,&quot; Ryouko nodded towards Queen 
Serenity, &quot;but there&#39;s not enough of the Moon Kingdom&#39;s fleet left to 
really make an effective distraction. That&#39;s why we need to have 
Swordbreaker up in orbit, fighting against the Earth fleet along with 
the fighter wings while Ayeka and I take Ryo-Ohki in.&quot;

        &quot;No offense taken,&quot; Serenity waved, &quot;I&#39;m well aware of the 
beating our ships have taken.&quot; She smiled grimly, &quot;But why are only 
you and Ayeka going?&quot;

        &quot;Because we have no idea of his power level,&quot; Ayeka said 
dryly. &quot;My brother Yosho had an exceptional level of power, and if 
this Tenchi is really his descendant, he might have inherited some of 
that power,&quot; she sighed.

        &quot;Ruri,&quot; Minagi said quietly, and the blue haired Commander sat 
up at attention, &quot;I&#39;m putting you into command of Swordbreaker.&quot; She 
looked over at Ryouko, &quot;I&#39;m going with you.&quot;

        Ryouko opened her mouth to argue, then saw the look on her 
sister&#39;s face. Ayeka put her hand on her lover&#39;s arm to quiet her, 
&quot;We&#39;ll be glad to have you.&quot;

        Ryouko finally nodded slightly, &quot;We&#39;ll go in using the orbital 
battle for cover, make a quiet entrance into Earth&#39;s territory, then 
we&#39;ll go to their capital and have a little talk with this Tenchi.&quot;

        Lady Rei nodded thoughtfully, &quot;We&#39;ve got tactical information 
on the planetary defenses, as well as a few outdated maps that might 
be useful.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll take what we can get,&quot; Minagi grinned.

        Mitsuki got out of her seat, a grim look on her face. &#39;I have 
to admit, it makes sense,&#39; she thought, &#39;but I still don&#39;t like the 
idea.&#39; She was a bit surprised when Ruri drew her aside, &quot;Something I 
can do for you, commander?&quot;

        Ruri smiled grimly, &quot;I have a very good team aboard 
Swordbreaker, and I don&#39;t want to shift them around to fill the second 
in command slot.&quot;

        Mitsuki blinked, &quot;And?&quot;

        &quot;Baka,&quot; Ruri muttered to herself softly, then louder, &quot;I&#39;m 
offering you the job, with Minagi&#39;s approval. Interested?&quot;

        Rhione poked her in the side, and Mitsuki saw the broad smile 
on her face. Turning back to Ruri she smiled slightly, &quot;I accept.&quot;
